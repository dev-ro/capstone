All legends are born in truth.
From the Amazon
came the legend of the Tears of the Moon.
A single petal from the great Tree
could cure any illness
and break any curse.
Over the centuries,
many expeditions went searching
for the Healing Tears of legend.
None more famous
than that of the conquistador
Don Lope de Aguirre,
who was determined to possess
the Tears' power.
But the jungle protected the Tears.
History will tell you
his journey ended in failure.
But legend tells more.
That he was found
by the Guardians of the Tree
and nursed back to life.
That he demanded they give him
the sacred Arrowhead,
the key to finding the Tears of the Moon.
That Aguirre attacked.
But the jungle defended,
and Aguirre and his conquistadors
were taken,
cursed, never to leave sight
of the river again,
unable to leave or die...
...or so the legend goes.
"We know they disappeared here,
"in the region of Lágrimas de Cristal,
"and it is here that we will find
the true source of the legend,
"a tree that possesses
unparalleled healing powers.
"My esteemed colleagues..."
"...I assert that the famous legend
"of the Tears of the Moon is not a myth
- "but scientific truth."
- ...but scientific truth.
"One that could revolutionize
modern medicine,
"curing illnesses
that not only scourge our cities,
"but cut down more of our soldiers
in the trenches than German bullets.
"I have come here today to request access
to your exclusive archives..."
"...including an ancient Arrowhead
"recently recovered from
the lost expedition of Dr. Albert Falls.
"The Arrowhead represents
the missing piece
"that will finally unlock the location
"of, pause for dramatic effect, the..."
"The Tears of the Moon."
And you made your request, Mr. Houghton,
and the answer remains, emphatically,
- "no."
- Hear, hear.
Our archives
are the providence of legitimate scholars,
- not inspired amateurs.
- Hear, hear.
Be that as it may,
since I have your attention,
would you at least allow me
to, uh, continue with my, uh,
examination of how important
the Tears of the Moon could be
to medicine?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Shaka Zulu.
- Yes.
Through one simple act of innovation,
he came to dominate
all his enemies from the...
There was that,
but also the encirclement tactic.
You are not where you ought to be.
Yes. You're right. Uh, I think I...
The secretaries' gallery is that way.
Thank you so much.
A cure for all ailments,
whether it be consumption,
diphtheria, dengue fever,
yellow fever, hay fever,
fever fever...
All fevers, um, would be covered.
Excuse me.
Yes?
This area is for Society members only.
- Is it?
- Yes.
Oh, I'm so sorry about that.
Well, to be quite frank,
I've no idea how you even...
Mr. Houghton,
we granted you an audience
in deference to your late father.
This, however,
seems remarkably like a paper
I had the honor of refusing
when it was submitted by a female writer,
a Dr. Lily Houghton.
No relation, I take it?
None that I've ever agreed to.
Shall we help you
find your way out?
Here we are.
It's in the first crate of the lot.
And thank you so much
for your very generous contribution,
in solid gold bars, I might add.
Would make life so much simpler
if more people paid in gold.
I don't want the whole lot,
just one thing.
Seems someone got to it before me.
Um, they shouldn't have.
I'm sure it's all there.
It must have just slid somewhere.
Let's... Let's see.
It was definitely there.
- Stop her!
- Oh!
Hello. I just wanted you to know,
this is a Nguni assegai.
It's been mislabeled as "Zulu."
Grab her!
Oh.
Wait!
The end of the line. Get down!
- Oh, my God!
- No, no, no!
Good day, sir!
You think
you're the first to eject me?
I have been turned out
of some of the best clubs in Europe!
Oh, my gosh!
Fräulein, give me that box
and I will help you up.
- Stop! Stop!
- You are slipping!
Fare, please.
Can I put it on a tab?
You shipping out, lads?
Ha-ha! Bravo!
I think I speak for the entire Society
when I offer my most sincere apologies
to you, Prince Joachim.
You just told them my name.
Oh.
Oh.
It is Prince
"Joachim."
Joachim.
- Good.
- Now, Prince Joachim,
we could refund your money from the...
You keep that money, and you tell me,
who is that woman?
I don't...
I do know who that was.
Breaking and entering,
grand larceny,
and worst of all,
forced to take public transport.
Should I be concerned about you?
Why would you say that, MacGregor?
This is a petal that could heal all,
save countless lives, change the world.
Haven't you been dreaming
about another adventure?
If I wanted to go to a primitive backwater
where I can't understand
a word anyone's saying,
I'd visit our relatives in Scotland.
Barely got over that hideous trip
with Father to Bhutan.
You only lost two toes.
- I was seven.
- Then just stay here.
You can. You can just stay here.
Don't worry about me.
All alone, in the Amazon.
But who'd look after you?
Well, I have no idea.
Come on, cheer up.
Steamer to Brazil, rail to Porto Velho...
...then all we need is a skipper.
First of all,
let me congratulate you
on your excellent choice of skipper.
Of all the jungle cruises
you could take in the Amazon,
this one is undoubtedly
the cheapest.
But also the most thrilling.
Are you still giving a tour?
Yes, I am.
- Perhaps a refund?
- No refunds.
We should've taken the other cruise,
honey. Told you.
Skipper!
Skipper?
Skipper! I think you should see this!
Heads up! Coming through!
- Where were we?
- About to die.
Ah.
Skipper!
Sir?
Sometimes these buttons get stuck.
Skipper!
All right.
If you look to the left of the boat,
you'll see some very playful toucans.
They're playing
their favorite game of beak-wrestling.
The only drawback is,
only two can play.
There's two birds, and those are toucans.
I'm saying that only "two can" play.
Not one, but "two can" play.
Wow.
The rocks you see here
in the river are sandstone.
But some people
just take them for granite.
It's one of my boulder attractions.
You know, before this,
I used to work in an orange juice factory,
but I got canned.
- Oh...
- Couldn't concentrate.
Oh...
Yeah, they put the squeeze on me, too.
That's a good one.
I should've opened with that one.
You know, they say
the boa constrictor right there is capable
of eating up to 500 pounds per sitting.
Personally, I find that very hard...
to swallow.
Mommy, can you please make him stop?
No one can.
And don't interrupt me like that again.
I will feed you to the boa.
She is a small child.
He loves small children.
Close your mouth.
Hey! Hey!
Hands in the boat!
Know this about the jungle,
everything that you see wants to kill you.
And can.
Poison angel's trumpet.
Strychnos. Curare. Banana spider.
Marauders, dead of fever,
for never finding the Fountain of Youth.
Adventurers, stung by stingrays,
searching for cities of gold.
Conquistadors, cursed,
for slaughtering innocent natives.
And then there's the ones
that just got eaten
by the deadly hippopotamus.
But hippos aren't native to the...
Shh.
Look out!
This is the highlight of the tour.
It's my favorite part of the jungle.
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready
for the eighth Wonder of the World.
Wait for it...
The backside of water!
It looks just like the front side.
It's completely different.
It's the eighth Wonder of the World,
the backside of water.
Guys, get your cameras out, come on.
You don't wanna miss this.
Snap, snap, snap.
Keep snapping.
I hope those aren't the Puka Michuna,
the deadliest hunters in the hemisphere.
They hunt humans!
Come on.
Please, go faster.
Oh, any faster would damage my engine,
and I can't afford a new one.
Grazie.
Prego.
All right, listen up, I get paid
by the number of people I take out,
not by the number of people
I bring back. Hold on!
Ah. Be a good chap and, uh,
take care of the luggage.
Told you not to wear trousers.
Drawing unnecessary attention.
I don't care in the slightest.
Hello.
Well, folks,
you were all outstanding today,
now I need you all out,
standing on the dock.
That means "get off my boat."
I'm only serious.
Au revoir.
Ma'am, don't forget
- to collect your baggage.
- Thank you.
I'm only kidding. He's behind you.
Adiós.
Make sure you take care of Zaqueu,
he's a good kid.
He looks 10, but he's secretly 47.
Thank you, sir.
Look, how stunning. Did you make these?
Beautiful.
Oh, that is awful.
Excuse me, I just think that you...
Let's not start a fight
with a monkey vendor.
I'm not going to start a fight.
They clearly shouldn't be in cages.
Oh, my gosh! Look, there's the boats!
Look, look, look!
Right. I think we've earned ourselves
some nice lunch at the hotel,
then a bath and a cocktail.
We did not travel half the globe
for baths and cocktails.
We must find this Mr. Nilo
and secure our travel. Come on!
Frank owes me money.
Buongiorno, Frankie boy!
Please don't call me that.
Hey, Frankie, you know what today is?
Frank owes me money.
It's the third Tuesday of the month.
My money, Frank. My contante.
Where is it?
Oh, you mean this money? It's all here.
I just need this,
so I can finally eat this week.
The rest è per te.
You insult me, Frank.
This is not all of my money.
This is like a little pinky toe,
nothing...
Itty-bitty, little nothing
of my money, Frank.
You borrow money from me
to get a new engine,
well, you got to pay me back,
plus interest.
Yeah, I'm going to keep
your engine for now.
I get 5,000 real in one week,
then you get it back.
I don't get my money in one week,
then I keep your whole boat.
What do you want my boat for?
You have nice boats.
You have all the boats.
Not yet, I don't, Frank.
But I bet you I will.
I'm gonna guess, by next week.
Arrivederci, Franco.
Ugh, what fresh hell is this?
Oh, I love it!
Excuse me, um,
do you know Mr. Nilo...
Classy clientele.
Home again, Rosita.
Mmm.
Hey!
Perhaps I should search
for Mr. Nilo elsewhere.
There's always a chance
he's at the hotel bar.
Fine. But be quick about it
or I'll leave without you.
Oh, that option is becoming
increasingly desirable.
Excuse me.
Um, Mr. Nilo's office?
Upstairs. Thank you. Obri... Obrigada.
How you doing?
Mr. Nilo? Hello?
Frank owes me money.
Ah, there you are. I was hoping
we might have a small business chat.
Not a good chat time right now.
But if you came back
first thing tomorrow morning,
lots of available chat then.
No, I would much prefer now.
My name is Dr. Lily Houghton,
and my brother and I
are looking for passage upriver,
and I'm told that you are
the man for the job.
- You were told wrong.
- That's impossible, because you come...
...highly recommended.
I have an idea. Please go away.
Mr. Nilo, your name is plastered
all over the boats outside.
I think you're being a bit unreasonable.
You're the one trying
to break down my door.
I have a lot of money.
Oh.
- You're insistent.
- It's been said.
Now, we're headed upriver,
in the direction of the Peruvian Andes.
This region doesn't really have a name
on the conventional map,
but it was once known to some
as Lágrimas de Cristal.
You're wearing pants.
Trousers. And yes, as are you.
Do women in England do that now?
Well, we're not in England,
last time I checked.
Now, look, as shocking
as the pants are, I'd really...
Frank owes me money.
Frank owes me money.
Frank owes me money.
- Can I get you a drink?
- Who's Frank?
- I have no idea.
- I will have a little something.
- Spritzer, I assume?
- I'll have whatever you're having.
So, do you know the region, Mr. Nilo?
Well, if it's on the Amazon River,
I know it.
And, lady, I could tell you,
of all the places in the world you can go,
the last place you wanna go
is Lágrimas de Cristal.
Oh, but I do. And I will.
Oh, but you won't, Pants.
You can't get there. Nobody can get there.
And if they could, they wouldn't.
It's not a fun vacation.
Well, I'm not here for a vacation.
Where'd you get the map?
Isn't it extraordinary?
The detail and the care he took.
It was drawn by Aguirre's cartographer.
And it belonged to my father,
who used to tell me
all about the Tears of the Moon
when I was a little girl.
So, that's why you wanna go?
Your daddy's bedtime stories?
Look, can you get us there or not?
Or has this just been
a colossal waste of my time?
I could get you there,
but you have to consider the dengue fever,
anaconda, plus,
look, lady, that's the home
of the actual Puka Michuna.
They're the ones that like to eat you
and wear your eyes for beads.
Look, lady, I gotta be honest with you,
let's do something that's safe.
So, me, you, and your pants,
we can go for a ride around town.
That'd be fun.
I'll show you some waterfalls.
You look like you like waterfalls.
And I'll also show you
the herd of pygmy elephants we just found.
Let's go see some elephants.
- I lost my key for that thing.
- Did you?
I did.
Well, that's never gonna do it.
You're gonna hurt yourself.
Those are very sharp.
Mr. Nilo, I spent my childhood playtime
with the toddler pickpockets
of Delhi, so...
There we go.
Allow me to manage my own safety,
if that's all right.
Now, shall we negotiate a price?
Or shall I just cast about
for another skipper?
Two beers, two steaks.
Who's paying for all this?
Oh, Mr. Nilo insisted it was his treat.
That's right.
I consider 5,000 real more than adequate.
10,000, I take you there myself.
I am my best captain.
Oh, and your most modest.
Fine, 10,000.
10,000 to bring you there alive.
If I have to bring you back dead,
it's 15,000.
Why should I pay more dead?
Dead, I'd have to carry you.
Dead's a lot harder, lady.
20, dead or alive.
Okay, but I get paid in full
when we turn back
before Lágrimas de Cristal.
Why ever would we be turning back?
Well, you're gonna beg me to turn back,
first sign of the rapids.
Well, I look forward to disappointing you.
Lily,
look who I found at the hotel bar.
- Ah!
- Mr. Nilo.
Buongiorno, signorina.
He drives a hard bargain,
but he met his match with me.
Negotiated him down to 50,000.
Who's your friend?
Not Mr. Nilo.
- Not Mr. Nilo, no.
- No.
So, I suppose that would make you...
Enjoying your meal, Frank?
As in, "Frank owes me money," Frank?
Of course. It's all making perfect sense.
I suppose it's only a scam
if you fall for it.
Well, thank you, Mr. Frank.
I hope we never meet again.
Mr. Nilo, hello.
- Did you just whistle at me?
- 12,000.
Eh, scusa.
- 10,000.
- Aren't you missing an engine?
Signorina, he could not get you
as far as the outhouse.
In fact, his boat kind of
looks like an outhouse.
You're never gonna find a faster boat
in the harbor than La Quila.
Plus, she has the finest bath
in all Brazil.
Why should I trust you?
I'm the only one that could get you there.
Oh, my gosh!
Careful. They can smell fear.
I am not afraid.
Might be me. Warm, liquid fear.
Shoo.
Everybody stay calm!
- A little bit more fear just came out.
- Shut up!
Ouch.
He did it!
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.
Frank Wolff. Jungle Navigation.
Best rates in town,
completely jaguar-free.
Thank you.
You are a lot of things
that I don't really care for.
But you are capable, so,
12,000.
- 15,000.
- 12,000.
- 15...
- Nuh!
12. Half now, half upon return, alive,
and if we have a deal, I'll meet you
at the docks with our luggage.
- We have a deal.
- Good.
La Quila will be ready
first thing in the morning.
Oh, no, "Frank owes me money,"
we're gonna depart in 10 minutes.
No, it gets dark in two hours.
Does it?
We should probably leave in 10 minutes.
Good decision.
Not now.
I said, not now.
Come here.
You did good, Proxima. You're a good girl.
You were a little late,
and you bit me way too hard.
But you did good.
Jungle doesn't care
how pretty your dresses are,
you're never gonna get
all your luggage on my boat.
Not mine.
Mine. And, I assure you,
every one of these items
is entirely necessary for my survival.
Well, with all this extra added weight,
we'd be lucky to even
get out of the harbor, so, no.
Dinner without a dinner jacket
is hardly, well, dinner, is it?
Now...
be a good chap.
What're you gonna do with those birds?
We're gonna stuff them
and send them to Paris.
No, you're not.
How much?
What on Earth do you think you're doing?
Hey!
MacGregor!
That will need to be
retrieved immediately.
Help, MacGregor!
MacGregor!
No.
Those are my tennis rackets.
It's a river cruise.
- Assorted day wear and shoes?
- No.
Light reading and bathing costumes?
Good.
- The liquor?
- That one can stay.
Now, listen here, you buffoon,
if you scuttle any more
of my luggage, I will...
Gosh, there's a lot of you, isn't there?
- Yeah, there is.
- Lily?
Lily?
Hey!
- Nilo! He's got your engine!
- Oh, we gotta go.
Not without my sister.
Come on. Get your stuff. Let's go.
Lady!
Let's go.
I am not leaving without my toiletries.
Shut down that engine!
Okay, time to leave.
Why are they chasing us?
I have no idea.
Here's the English woman. Pay up.
Lily.
Turn starboard. Resume heading.
What?
I don't know what that means.
Lady, look, we gotta...
Oh, God, sorry, Frank.
It's all right. Strong form.
Frank, follow me.
Don't go up there. It's that way.
Lady, it's that way.
Lady! Leave the monkeys.
The monkeys are fine.
Don't go up there.
- Lady, stop!
- Not now, Frank!
How you doing, Pants?
I'm good.
You know, I was trying
to tell you about the...
- I know.
- Come on.
No.
Come on! Lady, jump!
What are you waiting for?
There they are!
- Where's Lily?
- There.
Of course she is.
Okay. Come on, lady.
Tucking in a spot of sightseeing?
How nice of you to join us.
Why didn't you jump in the water?
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- She can't swim.
You booked a river cruise
and you can't swim?
I have no intention of swimming.
And what about the 20 guys
chasing us around town?
I may or may not have
something in my possession that
may or may not be of interest
to other interested parties.
Shh!
I assume she escaped your grasp, Axel.
Yes, your excellency.
Then I'll take care of it myself.
The Tree is the key to
Germany winning this war.
The Arrowhead will show us the way
to the Tree.
We cannot let it leave this harbor.
Surface!
- Who are those guys?
- Oh, my gosh.
The price just went up.
Batten down!
Come on!
- What happened?
- We lost all power.
Lady...
Reload!
I need you to take the wheel.
No, no, no. I am an excellent driver.
Anyone but you.
Starboard.
- Quick, before he reloads.
- You missed...
Understood.
- It's all yours.
- Oh, thank God!
Frank...
You steal my engine?
Get off my dock!
It's private property, Frank.
You're finished.
Ciao.
Sink them
and we can recover the Arrowhead
from the bottom of the river!
Load torpedoes.
- Load torpedoes!
- Torpedo in. Closing the hatch!
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.
Closer. Closer.
- Lily?
- Do you know,
- if I were you, Frank...
- Well, you're not me.
I just feel that sometimes
it just needs a bit of a...
This is my engine.
Nobody touches my engine but me.
What did I just...
There you go.
Goodbye.
Is that a...
- Torpedo.
- Oh, my God.
Frank, Frank, Frank!
Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank!
- What are you doing?
- We can't outrun it.
Frank!
Oh.
Look what they did to you.
Poor thing.
I'm so sorry. Machine guns.
Who brings a submarine to the Amazon?
But you still outran them. Every time.
I thought I'd keep it casual.
Well, you've really
outdone yourself this time.
Do we know the identity
of our homicidal maniac in the submarine?
No, I don't know his name.
But the youngest son of Kaiser Wilhelm
wrote several articles
about the Tears of the Moon.
And if I had to guess,
I would say that that's him.
Aren't you hot in all that?
Not in the slightest.
My eyeballs are sweating.
Are you all right, love?
Oh, my... Oh, my goodness!
MacGregor, look!
Inia geoffrensis!
Oh, how beautiful!
You know, here we call them "encantado."
- "Bewitched"?
- Yeah. Shape-shifter spirits.
Don't look them directly in the eye
unless you want nightmares for life.
You believe in legends,
you should believe in curses, too.
Okay.
Hey, MacGregor.
Had a girlfriend once, she was cross-eyed.
Didn't work out.
We could never see eye to eye.
Oh, my God.
Is that your idea of a joke?
That is not funny.
I'm also quite sure
she was seeing somebody on the side.
Silly.
You know, most people smile
when they're on camera, Frank.
It's a moving picture camera.
Have you never seen one before?
I've never seen a moving picture.
They're so much fun
and you can experience
being anywhere in the world.
Ah.
Although, why would you want to,
if you could be here,
surrounded by all this?
It's just...
Oh, it's like drifting
through the Garden of Eden.
It's just beautiful.
Look at this.
Frank, did you see these heliconias?
Do you know
there's more individual species
on one tree in the Amazon than there is...
MacGregor, I think you seem
to be taking us off course.
We should turn that way.
No, we're good. Stay on course.
Lágrimas de Cristal is that way.
- Frank, Frank...
- He's fine.
I think you're mistaken.
I'm not mistaken, I'm the skipper.
The Lágrimas de Cristal is straight ahead.
Stay on course.
Frank, it says on the map
that it's passable.
Here we have that cliff
and exactly that tributary.
We can save two days going this way.
We cannot go that way.
We have to go that way.
Lágrimas de Cristal is that way.
We go that way, it's rapids.
You ever been down the rapids?
No, but I presume that you have...
- Yes.
- ...which is why I hired you!
So just...
turn that way. To the right.
Starboard. Whatever you call it.
I'm not the one who can't swim, Pants.
Don't you worry about that, Skippy.
Lady, it's "Skipper."
My mistake.
This godforsaken, endless Amazon,
with its infinite tangled tributaries.
Dr. Houghton and the Arrowhead
could be anywhere.
There's only one person
who has ever gotten close
to the Tears of the Moon.
We shall have to ask him directly.
We'll set a new course.
But, Your Highness,
the curse of Don Aguirre...
That's only a legend, right?
We're gonna anchor here
for the night.
Can't we make good time in the dark?
Look, we can just keep going.
No, not unless you want
the engine to overheat.
Tell you what, Skippy.
After this day,
I could really do with
that luxurious bath of yours.
Is it, um, down there?
- No, there's no bath down there, Pants.
- What?
No, the bath is out there.
That's the bath.
4,300 miles of luxurious bath.
I also warmed it
a little bit for you earlier.
Oh, and I know you don't know how to swim,
so if you happen to drown out there,
go ahead and, uh, use the soap
to wash yourself ashore.
I could do with something to eat.
Someone threw all of my reserve food
into the harbor.
You know, Frank, if you think you're going
to cut our trip short by starving us,
let me tell you that
that is extremely likely to work.
Do you expect me to eat that?
Oh...
Piranha.
Better eat them before they eat you.
No way.
Have to say, Frank.
These piranha are so good.
Can't quite place that flavor, though.
It's blood.
Oh.
Right.
I'm to bed.
Sleep anywhere you want downstairs,
just not in my cabin. It's off-limits.
Why on Earth would I want to do that?
Phew.
Bugger!
You're staring,
how do I make it stop?
I'm just not used to seeing
a woman in pants, that's all.
Awfully interested in my apparel, Frank.
Get your head around it.
You know,
you really bring those eyes to life.
Your perspective's a little off, though.
What?
Well, you're right, annoyingly.
- Do you draw?
- I used to.
Why'd you stop?
Well, I drew everything I wanted to draw.
Then I figured I'd learn something new.
Or perhaps you just need
some proper inspiration.
What about you?
Never lack for inspiration.
No, I mean, what're you doing out here?
Chasing maps all over the place?
Or is this your idea of fun?
- The Tears of the Moon...
- Oh, come on.
I believe that the legend is real.
- Which it's not.
- And I'm gonna find it.
- Which you won't.
- And when I do,
just imagine the lives
that could be saved.
Legend says one petal from the Tree
will heal anything.
It will change medicine forever.
It's the beginning
of a scientific revolution.
It's very exciting, Frank.
So, you wanna be the Darwin of flowers?
And I want to help
as many people as I can.
Wanna save the world?
I didn't say "save the world."
It's very noble.
- Well, thank you.
- It's also very stupid.
You are deeply unpleasant.
And off-key.
So, you'd rather risk your life
and your brother's life
to save people you don't even know?
Well, I don't have to
know someone to care.
Well, I don't have to care
about anybody, period.
That's apparent.
Look, I just think if you're lucky enough
to have one person in this life
to care about,
then that's world enough for me.
"That's world enough for me."
Hmm.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my...
MacGregor!
Proxima! Proxima!
Heel there, Proxima! Proxima, heel.
Heel.
Proxima.
This is your cat?
So, that fight?
- Faked it.
- For goodness' sake, Frank!
Is there a single thing
about you that I can trust?
Not a thing.
Great timing.
The natives
speak of this place with dread.
This is where Aguirre
and his men were punished
for trying to steal the Arrowhead.
There.
River water.
This is what you have been waiting for.
Look who is here.
The legend in the flesh.
River water. You want to see more?
A long, painful wait
to see the river again.
The Tears of the Moon
can break your curse,
free you from this jungle.
You want what I need.
Detonator.
The Arrowhead is near.
You will find it for me,
and we both get what we want. Deal?
Swear it.
Good.
Ah, look who had nightmares.
All right, we're about to hit
the butter churn. Ready, Pants?
You sure this is the only way?
You picked the route.
You wanted to save two days.
Uh, "butter churn,"
how literal a metaphor?
If you have anything of value,
I would recommend
that you store it below deck.
Since I consider myself of value,
I will see you all on the other side.
Wait a minute. MacGregor.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Do not lose it.
You see that?
I want you to bring that to me.
It's been lovely knowing you.
Don't say that.
Go.
Oh, not you again. Go away.
You sure you're up for this, Pants?
Just drive the boat, Skippy.
That ruddy cat!
- What are you doing?
- She's incessant.
Here we go.
Oh, my God!
You okay, lady?
- I'm fine.
- You wanna turn back, Pants?
Nope. Just getting started.
Good. Me, too.
Slow down!
You wanna turn back?
Just drive!
Looks like you wet your pants, Pants.
That was the wave.
You should give up.
You should give up the guitar.
Oh, my God!
Come on, buena niña.
Come on!
Please don't ever do that again.
I could turn the boat around and we could
head back to town, how's that?
That may be the first intelligent thing
you've said since we met.
How about you, Pants?
You ready to go back to town?
No?
I actually loved, uh,
the whole experience.
I... I found it, um, exhilarating.
You're looking a little green
around the gills.
That's why I'm asking.
Are you okay?
Are you hungry?
Yeah, she's hungry.
Have some cured piranha
if you think you...
You did good...
Did you get it?
Ugh!
You're drunk?
You're the worst cat I have ever had.
I don't know how you live with that woman.
I've been with her for two days,
and I already wanna throw her overboard.
Does take some getting used to.
Does she ever stop being so, uh...
- Lily?
- Yes.
Afraid not.
Headfirst, figure it out on the way down.
It should be on her crest in Latin.
Hmm.
What you doing?
Your funeral.
It's just a peek.
Your sister says
whatever she wants to say
to whoever she wants to say it.
No regard for anybody's feelings.
Doesn't matter who gets hurt. Usually me.
She takes after our father.
He was always chasing after
some far-fetched idea.
There's no such thing as curses.
Or cure-alls.
And there hasn't been a conquistador here
for three centuries.
Hmm.
So, why'd you follow her out here, then?
It was the third time
that I'd been presented
with an entirely suitable marriage
to a charming, educated woman
that sits on a horse well,
that I had to tell the lady in question
that I couldn't accept the offer.
Or, indeed, any offer,
given that my interests happily lie...
elsewhere.
Elsewhere?
Elsewhere.
Huh.
Well... To elsewhere.
Uncle threatened to disinherit me,
friends and family turned their backs...
all because of who I loved.
I would've been ostracized from society
were it not for Lily.
She stood by me.
And for that,
I would follow her into a volcano.
Pants! Let's shove off!
Would you care to explain this?
I said stay out of my quarters.
Oh, I bet you did.
So that you could keep
more secrets from us.
Just lie upon lie. I mean, Frank,
you are like an onion of deceit.
- What lies?
- That you're after it yourself!
I am not after it! Not anymore.
Not for a long, long time.
Okay, yes,
I came here seeking
the Tears of the Moon, just like you.
I have a map just like yours.
And a dozen others just like it.
Aguirre's cartographer
certainly was prolific.
Yeah, well, he lost his life searching
for something that can't be found.
I've tracked the legend to every village,
every island, every shoal.
Nothing.
And now I'm stuck
on this river ever since,
wishing I could be anywhere else but here.
But you never had this.
I'm going to pet you now.
And you're not going to eat me.
Understood?
Easing in.
About to engage.
You're not that bad really, are you,
for a big, hairy murder cat?
I don't usually offend so immediately.
Lily!
MacGregor.
Oh...
Where are they taking us?
We're headed
into headhunter territory,
which is a terrible place to be headed.
Oh, Frank, come on, not now.
I can't turn it off.
Lily!
Frank!
Frank.
...MacGregor...
What did you say?
I said that they should let you
and your brother MacGregor go, and live.
In exchange, you'll have to leave
all of your things and your clothes,
and I'll stay back as well.
That's very, very brave.
That is not something I agree to, Frank.
We're not doing it.
There's no way that the three of us
can get out of this situation alive.
I know these people.
Leave now and let them...
- No!
- Can I please talk for five minutes
without you interrupting me?
Oh, now you've done it.
Oh, no.
"The only thing of yours I want
- "is the Arrowhead."
- No.
Don't shake your head like that.
They hate that.
They hate that. Don't do that.
"I know you have it.
"It belongs to my people, taken long ago.
"You can return it and go free.
"Or I can pry it from your fingers.
"After I pick them clean of meat."
Oh.
Come on. You heard the nice cannibal.
- Hand it over.
- I'm a little rusty
in the Puka Michuna dialect,
so I want you to translate what I say,
word for word.
Okay.
No, I cannot give you the Arrowhead.
- Oh, God. Lily.
- Lily.
Shut up.
Just say it.
Yes, I have the Arrow
that belongs to your people.
She's being weird about the Arrowhead.
I will return it.
She's extremely difficult.
But first I must use it to find
the Tears of the Moon.
It's hard to be around her.
Now, if I die for that, so be it.
She doesn't mind if you kill her.
But you must let these two men go free.
Just don't kill me.
Lily!
Come on, fight me.
You, come on, fight me.
Go! Do it! What's wrong with you?
Lily...
Seriously, Frank.
Next time I'm going to charge you more
for this "booga-booga" nonsense.
Sam, we had a deal, okay?
No, no. I'm tired,
and this is a whole production,
with these ridiculous costumes!
And you told me
this was a nice English lady
with her wimpy brother.
And she's gonna get herself killed.
I know, because she's crazy!
She's crazy determined.
Lily, listen, the truth is I didn't get
a chance to call this entire thing off.
Remember, it's only a scam
if you fall for it.
You've gotta stop doing that.
- Wimpy, eh?
- In a strong way.
Strong form.
The whole family has strong form.
Can you translate it?
Possibly.
Possibly, but, you know,
there are some impediments.
Your English gets very exact
when you want something.
I have the tingling impression
we're to negotiate a price.
You get me.
Trader Sam likes a trade.
Oh, I bet.
- Would you like that hat?
- Hmm.
You can have that hat.
You've really done it now.
- You think she'll get over it?
- Not likely.
It wasn't personal, you know.
It was a pre-existing arrangement.
Cross Lily like that
and you are dead to her.
Dead and buried.
Entombed.
- Embalmed and entombed.
- I got it.
- Dead as a dodo.
- You're making it very clear.
- Dead, dead, dead.
- MacGregor.
This beer's actually rather nice.
- It's masato.
- Hmm.
It's made out of fermented spit.
You're drinking spit.
When in Rome.
God, I wish I was in Rome.
"The Tears of the Moon
"possess the power to cure anything."
Now, this word here,
there's no exact translation
in English. It's...
a pain to...
the soul.
Heal. Heal.
Heal the soul.
Pretty much.
Mm-hmm. Heal.
"To prove yourself worthy,
you must turn water to stone.
"Then mend a broken heart."
Ooh.
"For Tears to bloom,
"the great Tree must be
under the rare crying Moon."
There is one in two days.
"The Tree hides
"where the Moon bled.
"It sank into the west,
over the heart of the serpent."
Serpent.
"Where the fang bites its own tail..."
"Where the fang bites its tail."
Oh, my goodness.
Now, I told you
it was complicated.
Of course no one's ever found it.
Right, because it's not
in Lágrimas de Cristal.
It's here. La Luna Rota.
Yes.
How long would you say
it would take me to get down there?
Two or three days.
What about via canoe?
Excuse me?
Please inform Captain Skippy that
I will be traveling alone from now on.
You're never gonna make it alone, Lily.
Please tell him that he misjudges
my determination, also my driving skills.
Please tell Dr. Pants
that what's out there in the jungle,
she's never read about
in her little textbooks. Tell her that.
Well, I'm not gonna be falling
for any more of his ludicrous tricks.
They're getting really tedious.
If you go upriver by yourself
with that thing around your neck,
- you're never gonna make it out alive.
- Really?
We have to stick together.
- Do we?
- Yes, we do.
"We" is an interesting word, Frank.
Because it sort of implies
a bond of trust and honesty.
Neither of which you know anything about,
because you are a liar, Frank.
You are selfish, you are arrogant,
and I wouldn't trust you
as far as I could throw you,
which clearly isn't very far,
because you are huge.
So, there is no more "we," actually.
In fact, here's the rest of your 12,000.
Oh, and here's a tip
for such wonderful service.
This one is a driver.
Driver.
Yes. Use that for anything over 200 yards.
Under that, you'll need an iron.
War paint? Righto, yes.
For a warrior. Dilly!
Tickles.
This doesn't appear to be coming off.
That's 'cause it's tattoo ink.
It'll come off eventually.
In a few decades.
Oh, no.
Francisco...
- Lily!
- Oh... Frank, what?
- We have to get out of here now.
- What?
- Give me the Arrowhead.
- Do you think I'm a fool?
I think you must think I'm a fool.
Francisco...
Francisco...
- What's going on?
- That's what I was trying to tell you.
No.
You seem surprised.
It's impossible.
The myth is real.
After 400 years...
The Arrowhead...
...belongs to me.
- Save your family!
- Yes!
Oh, God!
Frank, Frank! Frank!
Come on. I got you, Pants. Trust me.
Hold on!
Frank? Frank, get it.
- Hold on.
- Come on.
- Frank, please.
- I got it.
- Frank.
- I don't got it.
- Frank!
- Oh, my God!
- Frank, get off me! What're you doing?
- I'm trying to get traction.
- This is ridiculous!
- No, no, wait.
Just leave me alone!
That was a disaster!
You're too heavy.
MacGregor!
Lily?
Sorry.
Get off her!
- No!
- Aguirre!
Driver.
- Lovely shot, sir.
- The Arrow.
No!
Frank!
We gotta go! Come on!
Get in! Grab that knife!
Now!
Are you all right? What have you done?
My foot.
It's all right. It's all right.
Ow, ow, ow.
You must go.
Get out of sight of the river and run.
Aguirre only wants the Arrowhead.
- Just run as fast as you can.
- Go.
They're coming! Go!
Get away from the river!
I have her!
No!
Give me the Arrowhead!
Aguirre, we're too far from the river!
Oh, my God!
- It's cool. It's me. It's me.
- Whoo!
Did you see the Arrowhead?
Have you really seen it?
Not only have I seen it,
I held it in my hands.
Finally we can break the curse...
and Francisco shall pay.
Forget about Francisco!
The Arrowhead, Aguirre!
Only the Tears of the Moon can help us get
out of this curse.
This jungle is devouring our souls.
We are disgusting.
Speak for yourself. I am delicious.
Do you really believe we still have souls?
That's why we need the Tears of the Moon,
they are our only hope.
The woman in pants has the Arrowhead...
and has taken it away from the river.
Because she knows
we can't follow her there.
The Prince.
He can follow the Arrowhead.
Tell him where she went.
You heard him.
Tell the Prince.
MacGregor!
MacGregor!
MacGregor!
MacGregor!
Frank?
Frank, you're alive.
How? How are you alive, Frank?
I saw you die.
I saw you fall. How are you alive?
Lily, I don't care
what you've done for me,
- if we make it out of here alive...
- Oh, there you are.
...I am never leaving Kensington again.
- Frank's alive!
- Yeah. Frank's alive.
Huh. Oh, um...
You've got a little, um,
something in your back.
Frank?
The name's actually Francisco.
Francisco Lopez de Heredia.
And...
I'm roughly 400 years old.
- What?
- I know it's a lot to take in.
- I will explain to you the entire story...
- There's no blood in you.
Are you a ghost?
No, it's complicated.
But clearly you're... you're not a human.
Okay, but it's very hard to focus
when I have a sword impaled in my heart.
Trader Sam, I need you to come and pull.
Vampire?
I told you last time,
I'm done pulling weapons out of you.
Oh, no.
It is, uh, Dr. Houghton, right?
Of Botany.
Look at it.
It's just hanging out like that.
Well, it's how it's made.
It's got a very strange shape.
Have you seen it out the back?
It's like... Woo... Like that.
Well, it's not...
It's kinda actually just straight.
One hand, two hand,
what do you want?
Let's try one.
You're gonna need two hands.
No, no, no!
- What, what, what?
- Oh, my gosh! That hurts.
- No, it doesn't.
- How do you know?
Frank, would you like
to bite down on my stick?
- Nope. I'm good. Thank you.
- No, for the pain.
I understand what it...
What he means. But no.
There if you need it.
I just feel like
you're very uptight right now.
And it's not helping me,
'cause I'm very nervous.
It's okay to be nervous.
It's your first time.
- Ooh!
- It is your first time, right?
- Yes, you know it is, Frank.
- I know, I know. I can tell.
I've done this hundreds of times.
- I don't know how to take that, Frank.
- This is special.
- Is it?
- It is.
- Slow!
- What?
Oh, you can't do it like that.
- That's way too hard.
- Frank.
Would you like me to give it a wiggle?
- Yes. Yes.
- Absolutely not.
I could pop around the back
and give it a once over.
- No, we're good.
- Okay.
You know what always helps?
If you put your foot on it.
- I'm a little nervous.
- Don't be nervous.
Frank, I'm gonna count to three.
You're gonna... I'm counting or...
No, I'm counting.
- One.
- 'Cause... Ahhh!
I dreamt I was lunching at Boodle's.
Hey, Doctor.
- We should go.
- Of course.
No. You've done enough.
I can't leave you alone out here.
Look at the state of you.
And you can't even walk.
Will you at least consider turning back?
I will be fine. I promise.
Do I smell?
Horrendously.
We have visitors. Open the hatch.
Good afternoon, my friends.
Something is there?
What is there?
You have found their river boat?
No?
Not the river boat? The Arrowhead?
The Arrowhead? Yes.
Show... Show me where.
We're taking orders from a bee.
Show me on the map.
Here?
Yes! You heard him. Change course!
Could you ask the bee for coordinates?
Don't be ridiculous, Axel.
Thank you. Thank you.
395 years...
...five months and 13 days.
I really thought you died.
Were you sad when I died?
I was very concerned.
For my soul.
For my expedition.
And for you.
So, what are you?
You don't bleed, I think you breathe.
You're not possible.
I don't know what I am anymore.
But I can tell you what I was.
My father was a mercenary
and he was recruited
by Aguirre's father in Algiers.
When my father died protecting him,
he took me in.
Raised Aguirre and me together,
like brothers.
Aguirre's daughter Anna had fallen ill.
She was all he had.
He vowed he wouldn't lose her.
I will travel far.
But I will come back to you
with a Tear of the Moon.
And you will run again in the moonlight.
Healed.
We fought the ocean,
only to be beaten by the river.
The jungle fought our every step.
I would've done anything
to find the Tears of the Moon
and save Aguirre's daughter.
Even chart the Amazon.
You were Aguirre's cartographer?
You drew my map?
Frank...
Really think my work is extraordinary?
I think you were
a minor master of your time.
Minor?
One by one, the jungle took us.
We were all but dead.
Still, Aguirre wouldn't turn back.
There was no world for him
without his daughter in it.
And then they came.
We would've all died had they not saved us
with the Tears of the Moon.
The petal's magic was real.
Its powers unlocked
by the Chief and his daughter.
All that was broken, the petals mended.
And all at once, we were revived.
And Aguirre was happy,
because he was closer than ever
to finding a cure for his daughter.
But he grew impatient.
Aguirre demanded
they give him the Arrowhead
and take him to the Tree.
You are not worthy.
The Chief refused.
Despite all the kindness they'd shown us,
he would've killed every last one of them.
She has the Arrowhead!
I loved Aguirre,
but I couldn't be part of the madness.
I'm not going to hurt you.
I only want the Arrowhead.
And I couldn't just stand by.
Give it to me!
Run!
No!
A brother's blade cuts deepest.
Traitor.
The Chief knew
he was breathing his last breath.
And he used that breath
to protect the Arrowhead
and their sacred Tree.
He cursed Aguirre.
He cursed all of us, so that we could
never leave sight of the river again.
- Where did she go?
- She can't be far!
Or the jungle would
take us back to it, for all eternity.
Aguirre hated me for betraying him.
He found me over the years, and we fought.
And fought again.
I got tired of being stabbed.
So I made sure he would never hurt me
or anyone else again.
I trapped them in a cave.
The river!
Where is it?
Where the jungle
couldn't take them back to the river.
We have to get out of here!
Francisco, you will pay for this!
And for 300 years,
the jungle ravaged their bodies.
Turning them into
the monsters they are today.
I don't know how they got free,
but I was safe for a long time.
What did you do?
Well, I made the best of it.
I built a town.
And that was fun.
Made some friends.
Lost some friends.
That's when I decided
to search for the Tears of the Moon.
I built a boat.
And I named her
after the goddess of the moon, Quila.
I charted every inch of this river,
searching.
Till I finally gave up.
And since I could never
leave sight of the river,
I started giving
jungle cruises to tourists.
All that time, all alone...
Well, not entirely alone, of course.
That's right.
Over the years, I would find strays
that needed someone.
The next, after the next, after the next.
And la próxima, la próxima...
- La próxima?
- Proxima, yes,
- I name 'em all Proxima.
- Oh, la próxima.
Oh, but don't worry,
you're my favorite girl.
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream
You're meant to join in
on the second verse.
I'll do it again, shall I?
Row, row, row...
I'm begging you, stop!
Are we there yet?
No!
Got one.
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with...
"S."
Thought you might want a lift.
Hey!
I don't take lifts
from strangers.
Cup of tea?
So, how do you enjoy this
jungle?
I beg your pardon?
This jungle.
- Yeah, sorry?
- The jungle.
Try it slower.
The jungle.
Could you pop it in a sentence?
The trees, the bugs... The... The jungle.
- The jungle?
- Yes. That is what I said.
- Right.
- How do you enjoy it?
It's actually rather grown on me.
I don't care anymore.
Sir, we have arrived at the target.
Ah. Time to make a deal.
Look, right through here.
You see the peaceful Puka Michuna tribe?
With the touch of this button here,
I could end 400 innocent lives.
Their only crime being
that they are still living.
Your sister and the Arrowhead were here.
Now, I need to know where she is going.
The choice is yours.
Do they live or do they die?
- Let me help you.
- No, it's my turn.
Okay. You gotta listen to her.
- It's perfect.
- Pretty good.
Yeah. Now we can just cruise.
Do you know how many years
people have been looking for that?
- This old thing?
- Yeah. That old thing.
How is it that you turn up with it?
Stole it.
You stole it?
Liberated it. How about that?
Okay.
I've searched for this thing for so long,
but I'm pretty sure it belongs to you.
What are you gonna do
when you find the Tree?
Lift the curse.
And what will happen to you?
Well...
I get to make a choice.
And I choose to rest.
Hey, Lily, look.
Everything that you see
that's new in this world,
I've seen hundreds of thousands of times.
Yes, but none of it has been meaningful.
All right. Where are they?
I don't actually recognize the specific...
- Where?
- There.
I think you got it.
The Tree is here
and will be ours.
I cannot share my discoveries
with their masters.
You've been down here a while?
This has got to be "water to stone."
Do you think that we climb?
I don't think we're meant to go up.
We're in luck.
There's a chamber down there
with a lever in it.
I think pulling it is the key.
That's wonderful!
It's wonderful. It's fantastic.
Only problem is that
the ancients who built all of this
were on average narrower.
- Mm-hmm.
- So, it's a great time for you
to take the finest bath in all Brazil.
- No, no, no. Frank, Frank, please!
- Yes. Pants, listen...
I cannot swim, Frank.
That is not something I can do.
You've never tried.
It's not about trying.
I have this very deep fear.
I'll do all the swimming.
- Frank, please.
- Listen... Look,
I can't do this without you.
I need you.
You have to trust me.
No, no. Frank, Frank, Frank, please.
I thought you might, uh...
Just turn around
and look at the waterfall, Skippy.
- All right? Please.
- Fine. Whew.
Don't look.
Are you wearing pants under your pants?
- Yes.
- Oh, my God! Frank!
It's okay. It's okay.
- Here we go.
- I'm not... No, no!
Wait a minute!
Something just touched my foot, Frank!
It's okay, it's okay. It was my foot.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
- I'm very scared.
- Okay. I got you.
It's okay. Breathe.
- Ready? Okay.
- Yes.
Lily!
Lily, come on, come on.
Come on. Lily, come on.
Come on. Come on, Lily.
What is the matter with you, Frank?
- You're alive!
- How could you leave me?
I didn't leave you.
There was a lot of fish down there that...
What? Fish? Frank...
There were lot of piranha,
they were coming after...
- I saved you. Look.
- Don't even look at me.
Fine.
"Turn water to stone..."
After 400 years...
I found it.
We found it.
Now you can be the Darwin of flowers.
The petal's right there,
you can be free. You can...
I mean, it's not like
the river's not beautiful,
but you can go anywhere
and you can see the world.
You can come to London.
I'm from London. I could show it to you.
I even have a motor car.
I could be like your skipper,
Skippy... If you want.
Lily, I would love
to do all that with you.
But I've made up my mind.
There is no London for me after this.
There's no motor car.
I'm ready.
No.
It's my time. It was my time long ago.
No. No, I don't accept it.
You could have one more life.
Luckily for me, it's my choice.
Well, it shouldn't be,
because you have very poor judgement.
But you have your world to go back to.
It's your world.
But it could be yours, too.
It could be that
one person's world enough.
Could be.
Lily...
Lily.
Hello.
Small chance I told a madman with a cannon
where to find you.
Oh, so, we finally meet.
Wow. Big, strong boy, huh?
Go to the bridge. Go.
I believe this belongs to you.
Now, the Arrowhead, please?
No, no, no.
Such an imaginative woman
seeking the Tears of the Moon
to share with the scientific community
that won't even permit you, Fräulein,
to sit among them.
To put that tremendous power
into the hands of the masses
would be pure madness.
When I could use the Tears,
not only to win the war,
but to reign for all generations to come.
Take them away.
Eyes ahead.
Navigate to the Tree.
This Tree is long dead.
You know more about the Tears of the Moon
than anyone, so...
you know how to make it bloom.
You will do this for me.
And when you have what you want,
what's to stop you from killing us then?
I could kill you now.
I'll do it.
If you promise to let them go
and give me one single petal in return.
I know the myths and the ancient ways
as if I've lived them myself.
Frank, do not...
If anyone here is going to bring
the Tears of the Moon, it's me.
If you can make
the Tree bloom, you may have your petal.
You have my word.
There's no other way.
But the little brother stays on the boat.
Little brother? I have a name.
Wow, it is wonderful.
Go ahead.
The Arrowhead should fit here.
- You better go help him. Go.
- No.
No?
I'll do it if you give me a petal as well.
If I give you a petal as well...
One petal. Not two. You must choose.
What do you think, Muscles?
Will you sacrifice your petal for her?
She'd have to kill me first.
Ja?
- Done.
- Done.
"Broken-hearted warrior
"climbed to the highest peak
"and shot his arrow into the Moon.
"From there, the Moon learned real pain
and began to weep.
"Where the Tears fell
grew a sacred Tree..."
Rum-pum-pum-pum...
Give me the Arrow.
Hurry up!
Trader Sam said we would need
to fix a broken heart.
It's not an Arrowhead, it's a heart.
You can't mend a heart that isn't...
...broken.
I'll take that petal now.
"Under the crying Moon..."
We must pluck the petals before it sets.
Go! Hurry!
Every time.
Sorry.
Shoot!
Good murder cat.
Where's Lily?
Up there.
Here we go again.
The Moon's setting.
The Tree is dying.
Whoa.
Come on.
Yes!
Lily!
This is a amusingly familiar
situation, no?
Give me that petal.
- No.
- You are about to die
one way or another,
but if you do not give me that petal,
so, too, will your brother.
His will be much more slower.
Give me that petal.
Just one is enough. Give it to me.
Never.
Frank!
Let go of me!
Take the wheel. Hold her steady.
You're the best cat I've ever had.
Get off!
It looks like
you haven't been very nice...
to my little friends.
Aguirre,
help me to get the petal!
I'll give you anything you want!
Money, ships...
Spain!
Royalty is not to be trusted.
Aguirre, the woman in pants...
Get her!
Aguirre!
Francisco has the petal!
Stop him!
- This is where you get off.
- What?
Tell Lily she would've been
world enough for me.
Where are you going?
Proxima. You protect him,
you're in charge. Go.
Goodbye, girl.
Let's give 'em one last cruise,
mi buena niña.
There's only one way to end this.
Come and get me.
Lily.
He's going to crash.
No, he's gonna block the river.
Francisco!
Give me the petal!
He has the petal in his pocket!
Enough is enough!
It's now time for you to die!
Right.
I think we've had quite enough of you.
Good night.
Not exactly what I intended.
A brother's blade cuts deepest.
Give me the petal.
He told me to tell you,
you would have been world enough for him.
Where's the petal?
I'm sorry, old friend.
He wanted you to have it.
Stop the boat! Stop it!
- Frank.
- Wait.
Frank, no!
No!
Francisco, what have you done?
This is worse than death! This is torture!
Oh, you are the most infuriating man
I've ever met.
Lily...
Frank.
Frank!
Oh, you're bleeding.
That hurts.
- It does?
- Yeah.
Well, that's good.
I can't believe you shot me.
- I know.
- Twice.
I know, but you didn't go down
the first time.
You should've just gone down.
You're both my world.
Well, well, well...
Nilo. Now you have all the boats.
Take care of her.
I stand before you today
to tell you about the Tears of the Moon.
The legend is true.
Our party traveled further into the Amazon
than any expedition had previously dared.
On our trip,
the lines between life and death,
past and present, vanished.
I witnessed things not to be believed.
Enchanted dolphins
that could haunt one's dreams.
Undead conquistadors,
cursed as prisoners of the jungle
for nearly 400 years.
A tribe whose chief, a lady...
No! It actually worked rather well.
My point is, this was a journey
the likes of which
this society has never seen.
An adventure truly worthy
of this association.
But is this association
worthy of our great adventure?
You see, we didn't seek
the Tears of the Moon
so that we could be written up
in some journal
for a load of crusty old farts.
My sister, who just made
full professor at Cambridge,
has asked me to respectfully reject
your invitation of membership
on her behalf.
Which I will do. Just not respectfully.
Gentlemen, you can take your invitation
and you can shove it up your association.
How dare you!
Ready for your first driving lesson?
I think so, Pants.
I hope you know what you're
getting yourself into here, Frank.
A car.
Oh, your jokes.
They will be the death of me.
They are absolutely exhausting.
Wow, Lily.
- Did you like it?
- It was good.
- Yeah.
- Are you proud?
Oh! Frank, Frank, Frank!
- Oh, my goodness!
- Okay, I got it.
Frank, for goodness' sake!
- I got it, I got it.
- Turn now! Turn now! Turn now!
I got it all under control, Pants.
