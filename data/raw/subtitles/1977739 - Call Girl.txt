This is inspired by actual events.
Incidents, characters-
-and timelines have been changed
for dramatic purposes.
Welcome
to our Thursday chat show.
Tonight we have a foreign guest,
a unique star, here in the studio.
We also have
the Prime Minister here. Welcome!
But we'll start with
our foreign guest - welcome!

7 DAYS BEFORE
THE GENERAL ELECTION
How bad is it?
5 MONTHS EARLIER
So what would that entail,
"state custody"?
Since the school does not want Iris
to return - probably a foster home.
Or something else. Unfortunately, we
haven't heard from the foster family.
I don't understand. Surely things
can't just go on like this.
No.
The parties concerned believe
that it would be best for Iris-
-if she were to be admitted
to Alsunda Juvenile Home.
She would live there full time
and take part in their activities.
It would provide some stability
- at least she'd be among her peers.
What do you think?
It can be difficult for them
to make these decisions-
-which is why we prefer
to give recommendations.
I think... Let's agree on that.
It can drive you crazy... She ran
away seven times this month alone.
SOCIAL WELFARE BOARD
Iris! Damn that girl...
What are you doing? Get in!
-We're all done then.
-How much do we owe?
Contraceptives are free
as of this year.
Isn't it dangerous
if they're that tight?
I mean, she's only 14.
ALSUNDA JUVENILE HOME
Hello. Gunnel, Iris's mother.
Mona Lindvall. Social worker.
Iris, I'm really happy
to finally meet you.
Do you want to see your room?
Do we say goodbye here,
or how is it usually done?
You do what feels right for you.
Here's her bag and...
a copy of her birth certificate.
-For her bus card and...
-Oh yes, that's right.
-Should I... Better you take this.
-Thank you.
Bye, honey.
OK, then. This way, come with me.
Hiya!
-Oh, this is Krister.
-Hiya! Welcome.
Did you see the notice board
with the cleaning schedule?
It shows which days, what week,
you do the cleaning.
And of course you have to tidy
your room, keep your things in place.
No noise after 9 p.m.
We have a telephone in the office
as well, for more private calls.
It's the same line,
but a little more privacy.
Let's see... This way.
You'll have to air it out. The last
girl moved out on Walpurgis night.
You can change that if you want to.
Look...
You're gonna do just fine here.
-I just had my hair done.
-Hands off!
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-Hello, hello, hello!
-Hi there, sweetie!
-Hello!
Oh, you're here? That's so great!
-Hello, honey!
-We've got a line going.
-You've got great boobs.
-What a performance.
-Wonderful clothes.
-Now have a drink on mama.
-You look gorgeous.
-Not bad, huh?
-You'll get her number?
-Absolutely.
Sasja...
You've got the Colonel, right?
In the workshop.
-See you on Thursday then.
-Yes, sure.
-How long will you be at it today?
-Oh, about three quarters of an hour.
-Well, I'm going up.
-Remember the 10.30 bill discussion.
-Maybe you should be there on time.
-Sure.
Several types of sexual abuse
should be decriminalized
-Change the sheets as well.
-Oh, I will.
-So how's your old man doing?
-No worries.
-And the kids?
-All fine.
They're quite big now, right?
Got a light?
Groovy.
You go out at night, don't you?
You're causing trouble. They worry.
We have a cleaning schedule
next to the entrance.
It shows which days, what week,
you are to do the cleaning.
And of course you have to tidy
your room, keep your things in place.
And no noise after 9 p.m.
-And of course you can't...
-No way...
That's great. You know what?
Take the room next to hers, Sonja.
Take the room next to hers.
-No, no, no...
-C'mon, man. Please?
-You can go in. She's too young.
-"Too young"? I'm 19.
-Promise!
-Not a chance. Beat it.
Come on.
Got a ciggy?
Shit...
-Hiya!
-You've got a groovy moped.
-Thanks.
-Can I have a ciggy?
-Where're you off to?
-Nowhere.
Can we come?
You're sweet...
-Pretty eyes.
-Cut it out.
Come on...
Shit...
That's neat.
You two look ready to drop. Mona is
pissed off at you for missing dinner.
We're going into town.
Stop nagging! Would you prefer me
to call you at home?
The girls want their money,
or I'll call you at home.
And you can kiss your fruit baskets
goodbye. Idiot!
He's out,
no matter how much money he's got.
Who the fuck does he think he is?
My God, they're wild,
and it's just Tuesday. - Hello?
Yes, Haga Street. I've got a...
I've got a super sweet girl for you.
Yeah, she's plump and lovely.
You haven't met Sylvia, have you?
She has a great ass too.
No, I don't think so.
-They're firm, but still soft.
- Sylvia.
-Dagmar wants you.
-Wait a sec.
-Hi, honey. At 5 today?
-I can do that.
- I'll drop the kids next door.
-You never complain.
-He's an easy ride, right?
- He's so horny for you.
-In the workshop?
- No, Haga Street.
Sasja has the address.
- OK, we're on for 5 p.m.
- What's the house number?
-Haga Street 35. "Svensson".
-She's just wonderful.
- Oh, not him!
I've sent Maritza to Reisen.
And Erling's going up to Ulla's pad.
-Do you need me this evening?
-You'll just have to work.
I haven't got a single girl left.
Hell, I'm exhausted.
Hello, wait a second. - We had a win
with Black Daisy last time, right?
-Yes, Darling came second.
-Darling...
Sasja, will you see to the Polack
later on?
No, Sasja.
Yes, you can rely on that girl.
-Hello.
-Hello.
Thank you.
Excuse me...
Matuszewski...
Sasja Mintze is connected to Lukasz
Tyszkiewicz and Pjotr Matuszewski.
-Military attaché and consul-general.
-She's one of the call girls.
Dagmar here.
So Dagmar Glans has a girl
in her stable from Z2...
-... who has sex with our guys?
-They must have something on her.
Dagmar Glans won't know that.
The Colonel has top clearance.
Head of the Defence
Materiel Administration.
See you Thursday.
-The fighter planes and all of that.
-Viggen.
Imagine what they say
in a heated moment.
As for security
this is a total disaster.
-So what do we do with the slops?
-I'll take it.
N. HOLM
Head of the Security Service
We neither wish to, nor can we forbid
anyone from being a housewife.
We neither wish to, nor can we forbid
anyone from being a househusband.
We strive for equal opportunities
for men and women.
Everyone knows that women
want to join the labour market.
Give everyone possibilities for
initiative, activity, responsibility.
To achieve economic independence-
-and to be able to experience
the community of working life.
- I thought you had a session now.
- To hell with the sessions.
- What will Mona say?
- What can she say?
It's not like she's my Mum.
We can get away after dinner.
Listen to this drivel: "The sessions
should create a basis for contact"-
-"and keep the personnel informed
about the girls' progress."
Bullshit!
They can't do anything to us anyway.
-So they came to get you?
-Mum did. My old man was too drunk.
Cut it out!
That's my polish. Give it back!
-Get a grip, Iris.
-It's my turn.
OK, OK! I'm going to pee in my pants.
OK, I give in!
-This took me an hour to do.
-Serves you right.
-Did you add the extra salt?
-I don't know.
-How do you know Sonja?
-We're cousins.
So you've known each other
a long time, right?
Yeah, like, our whole lives.
-Don't... I salted it already.
-I see.
We're going out later.
Can I borrow that polish?
No.
-But you're not going anywhere.
-What do I get?
One swig, not 15!
Don't touch anything.
Stop poking around!
-We're coming with you.
-No way.
Give me my mascara, you creep!
Mona... Did you know that Minna
and Mari go out at night...
What the hell are you doing?
Ouch!
Minna! Minna...
Minna, stop it!
-Iris, get a grip!
-Is everything alright?
-Get out of here, you creep!
-It's under control, Krister.
What are you making a fuss about?
Why are you doing that to her?
Got my period. Really bad.
You should be nice to each other.
OK?
Jörgen, you got a ciggy?
So where're you goin' tonight?
-Out.
-Can I come, too?
Nope.
What are we gonna do?
Just dance a little.
Four? I thought you said
that there'd be two of you.
-So it's not gonna work?
-Sure it will. Come inside.
Four, that is indeed
a good number.
Are you coming, girls?
Come inside.
You can undress in there.
Here are some drinks,
and then slip out of your clothes.
Come on...
Take them off.
That's it.
It's nice if you take
each other's clothes off.
I really like that.
Very nice.
Follow me.
Very good. Just dance a little.
-See ya later.
-What? Where are you going?
Here.
-Bye.
-Bye...
The main bar.
Excuse me. You can go up now.
POLICE ID
SANDBERG, JOHN
THE SWEDISH PARLIAMENT
Government liaison officer
Laurin-Wall.
-Wall, W...
-No, I can't find you here.
This is ridiculous.
You're new, right?
He's with me.
-You'll be at the meeting Thursday?
-Oh, yes.
See you this afternoon.
Prejudice and taboos have long
prevented a natural and open view-
- on sexuality and its manifestation.
However, a radical attitude change
has occurred recently.
The concept of incest is abolished.
Sexual relations
between family members-
-will no longer
be considered criminal.
For sexual touching, that isn't
considered to be sexual intercourse-
-an age limit of 10 years
is suggested instead of 15 years.
The concept of rape is kept,
but only for cases-
-when the perpetrator
has acted with recklessness.
-Wrong room again, Aspen.
-Right, and so are you.
They're working in there?
The sex crimes commission.
Drafting the new bill.
Oh, right...
You know, I like the view
from up here better.
If a person has sexual intercourse
with a child under 14 years-
-a fine or imprisonment for no more
than two years shall be imposed.
In limited cases, no onus
of responsibility will be attributed.
Should "lowered from 15 years
to 14 years" be emphasized?
The Minister of Justice should rather
emphasize the liberal aspect.
Indeed. Let's continue.
Finished soon?
We have a sanction meeting-
-with the Crime Prevention Council
to prepare.
The timing may be off, but the draft
for your main speech is on your desk.
-And the one for Friday is ready.
-You work even faster than I do.
Listen, do you have
any more of those...
-What do you call them?
-Just let me know.
-Whatever you need.
-Thank you.
Hey, Iris!
Your mother called
but I couldn't find you, so...
-Is that perfume you're wearing?
-Did she send me money?
Don't you think you're being
a bit too tough on her?
Wait a minute.
I have something for you.
Here... You and Sonja can go
pick out some new clothes.
-You know what that'll get us.
-Like wearing paper bags.
Alsunda Juvenile Home.
-Hello, can I speak to Iris?
- Hold on a minute.
-Iris!
-Now what?
Telephone for you.
Can you use the corridor phone?
Hi, Mum.
You gonna hang up, or what?
-Hello?
- Here's Stig.
Hello, pet. Are you coming over?
That's nice, girls. Keep on dancing.
Caress yourselves a bit.
Fondle your tits.
Oh, yes...
That's good...
Relax, it's alright.
Hi, Stickan! Quite the little shindig
you have going on, huh?
How you doing, mate?
Hi there, girls. Dagmar.
Dagmar Glans. Pleasure.
-This here is Glenn.
-Hello.
The bootjack. Thanks.
What kind of a namby-pamby bar
is this, Stickan, huh?
Bring out Jim, Jack and Johnny!
What do you want, huh?
We have...what?
We have gin and vodka and bubbly.
-We'll give bubbly to the girls!
-Bubbly, hell yes!
Get the champagne!
You're such knock-outs!
Real knock-outs!
-Hey there!
-Whoopee, what a pop and splash!
I'm tellin' you...
So where do you live? With
your parents or with your friend?
No, we...
Sonja and I...
We live at a kind of home...
well, it's a juvenile home, actually.
-Let's drink to that, then.
-Have some more.
-Cheers!
-Thank you.
-Gorgeous... You're very photogenic.
-What?
You look good in pictures.
You turn out really well in pictures.
-When's your birthday? October?
-October...Yes.
-Best edition. Me, too.
-Oh yeah?
-That's something to celebrate, huh?
-Yes...
-You've got such beautiful hair.
-Thank you.
-I'm telling you.
You can take a few bottles,
when we're finished here.
But we have no place to hang out.
-To party, I mean.
-You're really pretty. Go on.
That's terrible.
But I can help you.
You can borrow my place.
Whenever you want to.
It's really very cosy.
-Really?
-Yes, sure you can.
Good God, you're gorgeous.
Come on, sweetie...
Here are the keys.
Oops. So damn pretty...
Chicks like you have the world
at your feet, huh?
Let's have a good time, oh yeah.
Just looking at the two of you
makes me relive my youth.
Sonja... Sonja, wake up.
Iris...
Here, for the two of you.
You're worth it.
A hell of a weather!
-Slops from your boys?
-Call girl business.
No concern of the Secret Services.
We focus on clear security aspects.
-But Vice might have some use for it.
-Anything on them?
I think you finally have your in
on Dagmar Glans.
-Worth putting surveillance on her?
-Send my regards to Violet.
Thanks.
I need a trustworthy man
to take it from here.
Hello?
Hi, honey!
Burton and Elizabeth Taylor
have gotten divorced again...
-Typical.
- ...after less than one year.
They first got married
in March 1964...
-I'm buying hotels.
-You capitalist!
Sandberg.
Nygren, Head of Investigations.
-John Sandberg, CID. My pleasure.
-I know.
Sören Laurin-Wall, his official title
is Government Liaison Officer.
But what he really does
is fix women for parties.
The girls give the doorman a cut.
Laurin-Wall sends them to the rooms
and the waiting men.
You can go up now.
They said you had clout.
Dagmar Glans...
You're awake and not crying!
See what you find on her
to prove procuring.
She's gorgeous.
Not a job you can give to anyone.
A one man job.
What you look for in a bag,
was once found in a sack.
Thought you might need some help
with the cleaning?
There are some stuffed
cabbage rolls if you want.
-Jonte...
-You smell disgusting.
Don't you want to eat?
Mum, are you giving me some dough,
or must I turn into a whore like you?
Thanks.
-Good afternoon.
-Hi there.
We're going to the second floor.
Iris, careful with the booze.
-Far out! You have your own key?
-Mhm.
Svante, is there any booze left?
-You gonna dance with David?
-I dunno...
-We're just dancing.
-They're complaining downstairs.
So, the rest of you get a move on.
-But what...?
-Don't worry, kiddo.
You can bang her another time.
So, off you go.
-Scram, sonny.
-Come on, Tompan, let's go.
-Fucking shit party.
-No, not you, girls. You go change.
Let's see what mama got for you.
You're gonna look gorgeous!
Time for a real party.
We're gonna hit the town.
You're so hot!
Nothing to worry about.
Had oysters before?
Cheers!
Cheers, dear.
You're not supposed to eat that.
That blush is amazing,
I'm telling you, guys.
I tried it,
but it didn't work for me.
-Tasty, isn't it?
-Mhm.
Excuse me, where is the toilet?
The ladies' room is upstairs.
We'll have another bottle.
One for the girls as well.
What does one of those cost?
A whole lot, I bet.
Aren't you the cutest!
Me?
There's nothing special about me.
You're an extremely special girl.
Do you like the clothes?
-I picked them out myself.
-They're really nice.
Yeah. I only want you to have
the best. Nothing off the rack!
I haven't seen him for two years.
He's a wreck, drinking a lot.
Now listen to mama.
Proper language.
Good evening! Delightful, isn't it?
Great to have you home!
No swearing.
Sonja and Iris.
-Say hello.
-Welcome.
-How is Margareta?
-She's doing fine.
You are doing so well.
It's all going
absolutely marvellous.
No questions. Just smile.
Just walk around, move,
look gorgeous.
I'll take care of the rest, huh.
Good evening, good evening...
May I introduce Sonja.
Charming.
Iris.
How did you end up here then,
my dear?
Let me look at you.
Delightful!
You're a success.
OK, then. We're off.
We're going to the Grand.
That went very well.
Just show a little more skin,
unbutton a bit...
There you go.
The boots are perfect on you.
They're nice and snug
when you make love with them on.
Wait. Where are we goin' now?
Grand Royal. It's really fancy.
Actually, we're supposed to
be going somewhere else...
Do you think I'm running
some kind of fucking charity?
Do you?
A bit extra for them tonight...
Here, girls.
-But I'm tired.
-Why didn't you say so?
Here.
We'll be down here. Room 340.
Get going now, girls.
Have some fun.
-Let's get out of here.
-Not now. Keep going.
Good evening.
Put that away.
Fifth floor, please.
But we're going to the third floor.
Why'd you kick me?
Still, you didn't have to kick me.
Let's get out of here.
You're so pretty.
You're new, aren't you?
There's money on the table.
Wait!
Hey...
Good night, girls.
-You want to set up a bug?
-Damn it, Rundgren.
We have strong grounds.
I know what I've got here.
-Been bending the rules, have you?
-What are we waiting for?
The Security Service has known
about Dagmar Glans for ages.
We are talking gross procuring here.
-This is our chance to get her.
-It can be damned sensitive.
For whom?
For Christ's sake,
I have listened to Jenkert's tapes.
You want me to take it higher?
Your signature, please.
PHONE WIRETAPPING
If bugging makes you happy,
go ahead and bug away.
So what do you want, huh?
Somebody with big boobs.
The kind that swing. Yes.
One girl gives great blow jobs,
but has a tiny ass.
- I'm in the mood.
-I'll see what I can do.
I have a rendez-vous with a girl.
Mama is instructing.
Black fishnets on.
Yeah, I promise. Bye.
-Hello?
- Can I speak to Iris?
-Wait.
- Thank you.
Iris! Phone!
- Hello?
-I need a baby-sitter.
- How soon can you come?
-Maybe we can get out in an hour.
-But I'm supposed to stay here.
- Not "we", just you.
Alone?
-No, I don't wanna go alone.
- Oh, you do.
-I can't send anyone else.
- Sonja has to come.
Not today.
Glenn will pick you up in 45.
But why can't Sonja...?
-Hello?
- Hiya, Dagmar. Sören here.
Are we set for tonight?
The Swan neck too?
- There'll be a bunch of men.
- It's set. Yes.
- All the girls?
- As you wished.
- Marinelle as well?
- You can count on mama.
My little treasure, I would never
send you to a nasty fellow.
I have the finest clientele.
Look here.
-Glenn, are you ready?
- Yes.
I have to put my curlers in.
Let's go.
My dad's a cop.
Is that right? Is he good to you?
Or do you get the baton all day long?
I'm only joking.
No, there's nothing like that.
Got it? He's real nice.
-Anybody have some talc?
-Yeah, here.
It's cold, you get goose-pimples.
-Coming to Riche later?
-Depends on when we're done here.
Lean back...
- Marinelle is down there.
We'll talk over the weekend. Bye!
-Bye-bye!
-What's this...?
-Got a ciggy?
-I'm in the mood tonight.
-Any lashes for me?
-Do the Spanish act.
No! I've quit.
Oh please, I love it.
Dagmar, will we go late tonight?
I have a final on Tuesday.
-In what, my darling?
-Political science.
You are so smart, Ulla.
Now, listen up.
You take the lift all the way up.
Don't talk to anybody, you hear?
Walk to the Finnish Gold Suite
and knock on the door.
When you're done, come straight
down again. Use the right-hand lift.
Off you go.
