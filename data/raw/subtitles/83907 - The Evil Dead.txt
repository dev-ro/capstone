Ash, where are we?
We've just crossed the Tenessee
border.
- Which will put us...
- Yeah?
Which will put us...
Here.
What the hell was that?!
Were you trying to kill us?!
Hey, don't blame me! It's your
steering wheel! Damn thing 
jerked right out of my hand!
I don't understand. I had this thing 
in for a tune up yesterday and they 
said they'd go over everything!
Well, you'd better take it back,
cause' the damn thing don't work!
The only thing which does work,
it is this lousy horn!
Go to hell!
I am not honking at you.
Jesus Christ!
Hey Scotty,
what's this place like, anyway?
Well, the guy that rented it said that
it's an old place.
Little rundown, but it is
right up in the mountains.
The best part is, we get it so cheap.
And why are we getting it so cheap?
Well, I don't know,
it might be in real bad shape.
You mean nobody's seen this place yet?
- Not yet.
- It might not be that bad.
- No.
- Actually it might be kinda nice.
- Yeah.
- It's probably a real pit.
I think this is where we get off.
This is the bridge we're gonna cross?
Jesus Christ! 
The whole thing's falling apart on us.
Don't let your eyes fool you,
girls. This thing is solid as a rock.
It's supposed to be one of
these aren't here.
Come with us!
Will you stop it!
I would like very much to make a toast here
for all this evening.
As a great friend of mine once said...
He said...
Ok, ok, ok...
Which means?
Party down.
What is this?
Whatever it is, it's still down there.
I don't like cellars.
Let's just close it up.
It's probably just some animal.
An animal?!
An animal?!
That is the stupidest thing I've ever
heard of! Jesus Christ!
But there is something down there.
Maybe it is just some animal.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Probably some animal.
Here, Sharon, why don't you go 
down to check and make sure?
Scotty, I'm not going down there.
Ok, ok, you cowards. I'll go.
Be careful.
Back in a minute.
Hey, Scotty you find anything?
Scotty?
Scotty?
Scott!
He's just kidding around.
Isn't he?
Give me a flashlight.
That's the only one we brought up!
Then get the lantern.
Scotty!?
Come here, I wanna show you something.
Look at all this stuff.
I bet this still shoots.
Probably, it does.
Oh, God!
Look at this.
Look at this...
This skull looks like
your old girlfriend.
Come on, let's take this stuff upstairs.
I'll grab the recorder...
and you get everything else.
This guy was a real turd, you know,
everybody hated him.
Like you.
Yes, just like me.
I am gonna break your face.
He has also invests in this western stuff...
Listen to this.
This is a tape I found downstairs.
It is been a number of years since I began
excavating the ruins of Candar
with a group of my colegues.
Now my wife and I have retreated to a small
cabin, in the solitude of these mountains.
Here I continued my research
undisturbed by
the distractions of modern civilization
and far from the groves of academy.
I believe I have made a significant
find in the Candarian ruins.
A volume of ancient Sumerian
burial practises and funerary incantations.
It is entitled "Naturam Demontum"
Roughtly translated
"Book of the Dead".
The book is bound in human flesh
and inked in human blood.
It deals with demons, demon
resurrection, and those forces which
roam the forest and
dark powers of man's domain.
The first few pages warn that these
enduring creatures may lie
dormant, but are never truly dead.
They may be recalled to active life
through the incantations
presented in this book.
It is through recitation of these passages
when the demons are given licence
to posses the living.
Hey, what did you do that for?
It was just getting good.
I just don't want to hear
it anymore, that's all.
Scott, come on.
Hey come on I just wanna hear the
rest of it. No big deal.
Shut it off!
Shut it off!
Shut it off!
Oh my God!
Sharon, where are you going?
I can't believe this!
Scott, you know not to you play that!
Come on, you knew it was upsetting her!
You just don't know when you've
taken something too far!
Hey, don't give me that! You were playing that too!
You could have shut it off!
Big deal! She's nuts!
It's just a joke, come on!
She acts like she's 3 years old or something.
Listen, why don't we stay up for 
a while and listen to the storm?.
All right! I will check up on
Sharon to make sure she's ok.
Stealing from the blind, huh?
Here.
Ash, how sweet of you!
- Would you put that...
- Oh, sure.
I was going to give it to you
before we came up here here, but...
things got so hectic and this is really
the first chance we've had to be alone.
Take a look!
Oh? Ash! Beautiful! I really love it!
I'll never take it off.
Join us!
Is anybody out there?
I know someone's out there!
I heard you.
I heard you in the cellar.
Ashley!
Help!
Help!
What happened to you?
What's the matter with you?
Did something in the woods do this to you?
Not! It was woods themselves!
They're alive!
Ash, what if I take her in the bedroom,
so she can lay down.
No, I don't wanna lay down!
I wanna get out of here!
I wanna leave this place right now.
Right now, Ashley.
Wait a minute!
I am not leaving any place.
- Sharon.
- Sharon.
Sharon, there is nothing here.
Trees do not attack people.
Ashley, will you drive me in the town, or not?
Right now?! Look, sure, sure! I'll take in to town,
but just listen to what you're saying.
I don't care, how it sounds!
I wanna get out of this place, right now!
Ok, you can stay somewhere in
town, tonight.
I know it's not gonna start.
It's not gonna let us leave.
Why're you stopping?
Wait here a minute.
Do you see something?
Where're you going?
Ashley!
Ashley!
It's not gonna let us go!
It's not gonna let us go, I told you!
It's not gonna let us go!
I know now that my wife has become
the host to a Candarian demon.
I fear that the only way to
stop those possessed by
the spirits of the book is through
the act of bodily dismemberment.
I believe now to avoid this horror,
but for myself I have seen the dark shadows
moving in the woods, and I have no doubt
that whatever I have ressurected through
this book is sure to come calling... for me
Ok. Let me think.
Is it seven?
What suit?
Diamonds... No, no, no wait!
Hearts.
- Oh my God! Seven of hearts! You're right!
- Ash, I guessed the card right.
Yeah, trully amazing...
I don't know. I don't know.
But I think it's some sort of
- an extrasensory something, like ESP.
- OK. Try this one!
I don't believe it!
Queen of spades.
Queen of spades.
Four of hearts.
Eight of spades.
Two of spade.
Eight of spade.
Two of spade.
Why have you disturbed our sleep
waking us from our ancient slumber?
You will die! Like the others before you.
One by one we will take you!
What happened to her?
Did you see her eyes! Ash, I'm scared,
what's wrong with her?
Sharon, stop it!
Ash, I believe we ought to get out of here!
Yeah. There are a few more
hours before the morning.
I don't think I can wait that long!
You have to, we all have to!
And than in the morning we'll get in the car,
and take the bridge, and...
Why does she keep making those
horrible noises?
I don't know.
Look at her eyes!
For God's sake what happend to her eyes?
Everything's gonna be all right!
Scott, I think there is
something out there.
Go to bed and get some sleep, ok?
Shelly?
Thank you, I don't know what I'd have done
if I had to remain on those hot embers...
burning my pretty flesh.
You have pretty skin.
Join us!
Join us!
Hit!
Hit her!
Hit it!
Scott?
Yeah?
What we gonna do?
We're gonna bury her.
Shelly?
- She's a friend of ours!
- Ash, she's dead.
Shelly is dead.
We've to burry her now.
Linda is still sleaping.
- I thought...
- I'm getting out of here!
Scott, we can't take Linda
anywhere with a leg like that.
We don't even know if there is another
way back besides the bridge.
Maybe there's a hiking trail, or an old 
road or a some other way around the cliff.
I mean there's gotta be another
way besides the bridge.
Listen to me. Linda cannot walk
with the leg like that.
She can't even stand up.
Well then, we'll leave her here.
until we can send somebody back.
- What are you, crazy?
- Look, I'm getting out!
I don't care what happens to her.
She's your girlfriend, you take care of her.
I'm getting the hell out of here, right now!
Soon, all of you will be like me.
And than I will lock you up in the cellar!
- Oh my God!
- Help me!
Scotty, you're gonna be ok,
You're gonna be just fine. You'll see.
Ash, it's not gonna let us leave.
Sharon was right.
We're all gonna die here.
No, we're not gonna die.
We're all gonna die.
All of us.
No, we're not gonna die. We're not gonna die.
We'll get out of here!
Now listen to me Scotty.
Is there a way around the bridge?
Scotty, listen to me, please!
For God's sake!
Ash, I don't wanna die!
You're not gonna leave me, are you, Ash?
I don't wanna die.
You're not gonna leave me, are you, Ash?
Scotty, come on, listen to me!
For God sake!
Is there a way around the bridge?
There is a road... but the
trees, Ash...
They know.
Don't you see, Ash?
They're alive.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Kill her!
Kill her!
Kill her if you can!
God, forgive me.
Oh, Ash, help me, please!
Ash, help me, please!
Oh, Ash. Please don't let them
take me away again.
- Please!
- No... I won't. I promise.
Ashley... Ashley, help me.
Let me out of here.
Ashley? Ash, help me.
Let me out of here.
I'm all right now, Ashley.
Unlock this chain and let me out!
Sharon?
Sharon?
I'm all right now, Ashley! Come, unlock
the chain and let me out!
I'm all right now.
It's your sister, Sharon.
You bastards!
Why're you torturing me like this? 
Why?
Shut up!
We're gonna get you!
We're gonna get you!
We're gonna get you! 
Time to go to sleep...
Useless!
Useless!
In time we'll come for her, and
then we'll come for you!
The sun'll be up in an hour or so and
we can all get out of here together.
You, me, Linda, Shelly.
No. Shelly, she...
We will be all going home together.
Won't you like to be going home?
I bet you'd like it, wouldn't you?
Scott?
Join us!
Oh, my love!
The door!
The back door.
Shells. I need shells.
We're gonna get you!
We're gonna get you!
Shut up, Linda!
- We're all gonna die...
- Shut up!
- all of us!
- Shut up!
...oh, how sweet of you
...through the act of bodily dismemberment
Hit her! Hit her!
Hit her!
Oh, come on... I'm all right...
Linda...
Join us!
Join us!
