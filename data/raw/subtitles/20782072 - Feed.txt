If anyone finds this...
tell my mum that I love her.
Nikolina Kostov was found dead.
The search is in progress...
Nikolina Kostov's boyfriend is
the main suspect in her murder.
Ilja and I just wanted to film
some content. We didn't think that...
The final moments of Serbian influencer 
Nikolina Kostov's life has flooded social media
But the authenticity has been under question.
- You think this is an ordinary homicide?
Children have been disappearing
from the area for decades.
The murdered woman in northern Serbia
is now a symbol of disinformation.
A satanic cult based on
female sacrifice.
Drekavac is a Slavic myth
and a metaphor for...
Tourism is blooming here in Surdulica
where the myth has taken a life of its own.
What's so intriguing about ghost hunting?
How do you see the murder of
a young woman attracting visitors?
It is not the murder that attracts,
but the myth of the supernatural.
Rumors of supernatural beings
take the focus away from the violent crime.
- Are we there? Okay, let's go then.
- No, no, wait a minute.
- Is that Kirsten?
- Mm. That's Jossan's BFF.
- And that's her girlfriend?
- Yes, exactly. Her name is Ava.
- Ava?
- Yeah.
It will be fine. Let's go.
No... no, wait!
It just feels weird
hanging out with your ex.
We are here.
I mean, look, she's so over me.
Shit, they're snogging.
- Elin. I love you.
- Your followers think you love her.
But not after this weekend.
It's over. Fuck her.
Okay.
- Shall we go through it again?
- Yes.
Good. Okay.
We will get out there.
'Oh, how nice! We're going to glamp.
That's so cool!'
Then we hang out a bit.
Swim and grill a little in the evening.
Then there will be some quarrel between Jossan
and me, then we break up.
We go to bed and when we wake up
the next day we talk and make up.
We cry a little and make a vlog:
'We love each other, but only as friends.
Yet we continue to make content together.'
Badabing, badabom, badabam.
And then I'm free!
- And then our life really begins.
- Mm.
But now I have to get out. It's
getting awkward. Come when you are ready.
Hey! Hello!
- Hey, guys. Is it 'Dim Sum'? What's up?
- Hi, Jens.
Hi, everyone.
And welcome to a new vlog.
I'm on my way
to the best glamping site in Sweden
-which is Kittelsjön's eco-camping,
with which this is a collaboration.
And many thanks to Samsung
that has sponsored me with a phone-
-so I can focus on
partying, swimming, adventuring-
- and simply be a little crazy
without worrying about the camera.
You have to share adventures with someone,
so I brought my amazing friends.
Hey. Here is Dimman!
- Dimman is of course always with me.
- Yes, you won't get rid of me.
But now we're going into the forest.
Stay tuned, and I'll take you
on an adventure. Hugs and kisses.
Hi! I'm glad you're here.
Dimman has spoken so fondly of you.
Oh.
What a view.
What was that?
Fucking piece of shit.
- Hello.
- One more time.
Hello!
Oh! Yes, hey.
- Welcome. We have a bit of a problem.
- I can see that. Jens. We talked.
- Yeah. Hi, hi.
- Hi. - Hey. Jens.
- Hi, there. Ulf.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- You're the star then, I suppose.
- Here she is. Jossan.
- Hello.
- Yes...
- Yes. Hi.
- Hi.
- Was it easy to get here?
- Maybe you should sign a little better.
What do we do now then? How does
this viral marketing thing work?
I film a lot of cool stuff and
a bunch of people come here.
- It's going to be awesome.
- Can you help me with this one?
- How much do they pay her?
- Too much. They are desperate.
They're bankrupt, so now they're
turning the whole place into glamping.
So a bunch of rich Stockholmers come
and spend a shitload of money.
- Yes, then it will be this way.
- Yes.
Look, the sun!
Watch your heads here by the branches.
- Here we have the satellite dish.
- Okay.
We want you to tell that we get
100 megabits via satellite
-so that people don't think
they will be without wifi.
Then it is important that you tell them
that this is luxury.
We have real beds, a wood-fired sauna.
and a hot tub eventually.
- Oh my God! So cozy.
- Yes.
Then we pull the internet all the way
out to the island there. Then we move on.
- I can take it.
- Fine.
There.
Sit down in the boat.
Well, here we go.
It would be nice if you included something
about how beautiful it is here.
In the summer, you can sit
and sunbathe on the rocks.
Well, everything is nice with the right filter.
You need a story.
There was that Märit.
Or? Isn't this it?
- You've heard of her, haven't you?
- I googled a bit before.
Who is it?
'Märit in the lake', she is called.
This is an old local myth.
Well, yeah. That's really cool.
Now we have something we can build around.
- Okay, tell me about Märit.
- Uh... Okay...
In the 17th century there was a woman
who was accused of witchcraft.
She sacrificed children and ate their flesh
along with the devil, they said.
As a punishment then, they nailed
-some kind of iron mask on her face,
right in the head.
And on top of her head there was a bell
so people could hear her approach.
She couldn't eat
and she couldn't drink.
It must have been unbearable,
because she drowned herself here in the lake.
They say she is still in the water.
She pulls people down
and eats their flesh with the devil.
Well, I'll have to cut a bit.
But this is gonna be so fucking awesome.
- I mean, people love this stuff.
- They do.
If Kirsten and I had met then, we would
also have had a bell on our heads.
Märit! Where the fuck are you, Märit?
Just stay out of the water,
and you'll be fine.
Märit!
- Oh!
- That's it.
That went well.
The sauna is on the other side of the island.
Here.
There's no coverage here,
so if you want to call us...
You have a great time then.
I'll pick you up tomorrow at
lunchtime, if there's nothing else.
- And you carry it with you all the time?
- Yes, all the time.
It will be great.
Thank you very much. See you later.
Hello again. We have not chosen Marbella
like everyone else, because it's abroad.
Now it's staycation time.
Wood-fired sauna, outdoor shower.
Look at this, a tent.
I live over here.
From the balcony
you can see the hotel reception.
They have warned us about Märit
who lives here in the lake.
But as long as we stay on land,
we shouldn't get eaten, apparently.
That's a good one, isn't it? See you soon!
Damn, that's nice!
Oh, shit! Now we're talking.
- This is not a bloody camping tent.
- Very tacky.
- We haven't really said hello...
- No wifi. You said I could post.
He said it wasn't ready.
Post when we're at the cottage again.
Fuck, you must be joking.
It can't get any fucking worse.
Yes, sorry, you said something.
Yeah... No, I was thinking,
we haven't greeted each other properly.
Oh. Hi.
- How long have you been an influencer?
- About five years.
- What about you, what do you do?
- I am a doctor.
Yes, I'm doing my internship now. Psychiatry.
Cool.
That's how you met Dimman, right?
The whole thing with Dimman...
It's really nice that you're here.
I am so over him. It's a good thing
that he met someone like you.
Dimman?
What color are your swimming trunks?
Whoa!
It will look great together.
Whoa!
- Are you going to swim with your clothes on?
- Erh... Yeah, how deep is it?
Come on, Elin. Just dive in.
It's awesome.
And break your neck against a rock?
No, thanks. I'm fine.
- What did you say?
- I'm going to break my neck against a rock.
- Just do it. It's cool!
- Nice girl you've got.
I don't know what you're doing.
What are you doing?
I don't feel the bottom.
Shit, relax a bit.
- But you are strong.
- I'm strong.
No...
- Can you see anything?
- Only darkness.
How come you're a manager?
You don't really seem like...
- The others?
- No.
I am a musician. I met Jossan
at a gig in Stockholm.
- What instrument do you play?
- Bass.
Oh... You get laid anyway.
No, I... Sorry, I mean...
It was just a joke, I guess.
I know.
It's fine. That's funny.
Do you want to try it? It's dead simple.
Don't touch it. It's up and down.
Here is left and right and forward
and backwards. It's self-explanatory.
- Oh, my God!
- Yes, you've got this.
- Aren't these really expensive?
- I trust you.
What's that?
What is it?
I saw something.
- I saw something in the water.
- It could also be the shadow of the drone.
- Jens, are you coming up?
- It's not at all.
I'll fly this one ashore. See you later.
Hey, we were thinking of having a barbecue.
Won't that be fun?
What is it?
I don't understand
what you are doing.
- It's only pretend, Elin.
- Maybe for you, but not for her.
No.
I'm sorry. But there's nothing
between us anymore.
It's nothing. Trust me.
I trust you, but I not her...
I don't even know her.
Let me think about it.
This... This is real.
Okay?
Okay.
- Thanks.
- You got really wet.
- It was kind of nice.
- Yes, very nice.
- You'll regret not taking a dip.
- No, I won't.
The flamingo was swimming.
I'll check on the food
and the others. Are you coming?
No, I'll stay here for a while.
It's the new slingshot technology.
Then it will be...
- I brought you a beer.
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, shit. Hungry?
- Oh, yeah.
- What did you bring?
- A veggie burger.
- Shall I get it out?
- Thanks.
Why do vegans have to imitate meat?
Mince and sausages that still taste like soya.
When there is regular vegan food.
Like some rabbit food.
There, Elin, you can take some salad.
That's delicious.
- Why did you stop eating meat?
- I like meat and cheese and everything.
But I wanted to do something for the planet.
But you have a mobile phone
and cheap clothes
-from the other side of the world.
But it's a nice thought.
Nobody can do everything,
but everyone can do something.
Nobody can do everything. Doing a little is not enough.
We have to do something drastic.
Yes, if we really want to save the planet,
we can all kill ourselves.
Well, play with that idea.
It would make a real difference.
- We start with veggie burgers.
- Yum! I think so too.
- I don't want to kill myself.
- You don't have to, man.
- What did you think of the burgers?
- So good.
Do you see how nice we have it here?
This is how nice you could have it
if you visit Kittelsjön's ecocamping.
The link is of course in the description.
Now we were thinking of swimming,
but... we'll see if we dare.
Like and subscribe, and you'll see.
If we get 50,000 likes,
I'll throw Josse to Märit in the lake.
You don't want to miss that.
Eat up and I can film later.
I want to film us swimming.
Why don't we chill out a bit?
You can get cramps and die.
This is a myth created by parents because
they don't want to swim with their children.
So when you stopped believing in witches.
you got cramps instead.
- Yes, it sucks.
- It's not fun.
- It has happened to me a few times.
- I know.
Whoah!
Hey, Dim Nation!
Dimman here!
As you can see, I am in the middle of...
We can't have it like this. We'll get you
a slightly better angle for you. Let's go!
Hey! Dimman here! Dim Nation! If you
haven't seen, I'm in the middle of an island.
Today I wanted to show you
some great exercises
You can do when you are on the go
and don't want to lose your gains.
Don't forget to like, comment,
subscribe. Here is Dimman.
- Sick. It turned out great.
- Was it?
Yeah, damn good. Check it out.
- I feel a bit off today.
- Is that so? It wasn't noticeable at all.
No problem.
Check it out. That's really good.
- Yeah, look. Exactly.
- It got much better, then.
So when will you
and Josse become official then?
I don't really know. I am quite anonymous
online. I like it that way.
It would boost your career like hell
if people knew you were a couple.
I am a manager.
I feel better behind the camera.
- How many clients do you have?
- Okay. Point taken.
But I enjoy thinking up content
more. Producing it. Creating it.
What are you going to do now?
- Pull-ups?
- Pull-ups.
I saw a crazy place over here.
Come on. I'm filming. Let's go!
I also have a hard time
with Jossan sometimes, actually.
But... sometimes you just have to pretend.
It's nice
that she invited us here anyway.
- Yes, although we are her backup.
- Yeah.
Even if you don't trust people,
you just have to accept the situation.
You can't change anyone.
Trust me.
Woah! Twelve of these.
When you do twelve, we do twelve more.
Because we're not fucking pussies!
- What the hell is that...? Dimman.
- Shut up, Jens!
Dimman, you're bleeding like hell.
What the fuck... Come down!
Shit, what the hell is this?
Holy fuck. What the hell...?
- Guys, come here! Dimman is bleeding!
- But it's not mine.
- Shit! What have you done?
- Nothing, Elin. It's not mine.
What the hell are you filming for?
- You don't have a cut.
- Where did it come from?
It was you, wasn't it?
- I've been here the whole time.
- Maybe it was Märit.
Bad fucking prank. This supernatural
shit freaks me out!
- Oh!
- Josse!
- Admit it!
- If it were me, I'd admit it.
- That's the fun part.
- Admit it, you've made a fool of yourself.
- It wasn't me...
- Just say it was you.
Okay, that was me.
That was me. It was fun, wasn't it?
- Jens! That's great!
- Right? You fell for it like hell.
Not fun!
Kirsten!
- Kirsten?
- Kirsten!
- Do you see her?
- No.
- Kirsten!
- Do you see her?
- Do you see anything from up there?
- No!
- I can not see anything.
- Kirsten?
Where the fuck...?
- What are you shouting about? It's fine.
- Amen, you're kidding.
- Fuck you, Kirsten.
- I just had a little swim.
I would have let you drown.
Do you know how expensive this shirt is?
It's bloody expensive, that is.
- It's nice to swim with your clothes on.
- You don't do that very often.
- What are you doing?
- Stop it now.
- What then?
- You can't drag me down like that.
- Stop.
- Dimman.
- What the hell, now you can stop!
- Fucking stop! It's not okay!
There! I'm over here.
There...
- Something grabbed me too!
- Fucking stop it!
- Get out of the water!
- What the hell, come on, Dimman!
Jens, come!
What are you doing?
- Oh, shit.
- It's not fun anymore. Just stop.
Something pulled me into the water.
For real. Something pulled me down.
For fuck's sake, stop.
It got me too.
Where the hell is Ava?
Ava!
- Help! Something is pulling me!
- Ava?
- Ava, Ava, Ava!
- Come here! Here!
Take my hand!
Fuck, fuck, fuck... Ava!
Swim, swim!
Take my hand!
Take my hand!
Ow!!
Ow!!
Do you have... a belt? Anything?
I have to stop the bleeding.
Can you fix a fucking belt?!
Okay, Ava? Right there.
I'll count to three, then I want
you to take a deep breath.
One, two...
Argh!
Kirsten, can you find the walkie-talkie?
Kirsten!
- What the hell! Can someone pick up the walkie?
- Walkie... Josse, pick up...
- Hello? Do you hear me? Hello?
- You have to press the button.
Hello? Do you hear me? Hello?
I need alcohol and water,
so I can wash the wound.
Hello, is anyone there?
- What have you taken?
- Nothing.
- What have you taken?
- I haven't taken anything.
Is it a painkiller? For her
sake, you must tell me what it is.
Oxy.
It is in the outer compartment of the bag.
Thanks.
- Hello? Answer, damn it!
- Yes, hello?
- Hello?
- Yes, I hear. Do you need anything?
There's something in the water. My friend
is injured. You have to pick us up.
Has anyone ended up in the water?
But there's something in the water,
so you have to come!
Okay, I'm coming now.
Chew, don't swallow.
There. It's going to be great.
It's okay.
- Please don't say anything. I have promised...
- I don't give a shit about your fucking reputation now.
Come on. It will be okay.
Here.
I really don't want to do this,
but I have no choice.
Kirsten, hold her. Sorry.
Okay.
Can he drive a little fucking faster?
- What's going on?
- Something's wrong.
- What the hell...
- Hold on a second.
I don't know. I'll have to paddle in.
- What are you doing?
- It is her.
- No!
- No!
No, no, no, no, no.
Yes! Up! Up, up, up, up!
Up in the boat!
- Let go!
- Up! Up!
- The boat!
- Get in the boat!
- No...!
- No no no no!
Shit!
I'll have to take her back into the tent.
Let's go.
Okay, what the hell are we doing?
But she won't come ashore, will she?
But you understand that she has to go
to a hospital. You understand that, right?
Or what, Jens?
You said she only appears in the lake.
You had read about her.
You said she was only in the lake.
- Jens!
- I don't... I don't know.
Wait...
Do we seriously believe
there is a witch out there?
What else could it be?
No.
No, no, no, no.
- Did you hear that?
- No, no, no, no.
- Hello?
- Shit!
- Elin.
- Elin!
Elin! What are you doing, Elin?
Why are you doing this?!
Elin.
- Elin, what happened?
- Did you see her?
- How do you know it's a female?
- What does it matter?
It doesn't matter. She has left
the lake and is walking around on land.
The old man was wrong.
It's the rain.
She needs water.
So are we safe here?
Are we?
- Film a little.
- What should I film?
Anything.
No one will believe us.
I don't know... We saw him
being pulled into the lake.
We're safe inside the tent, I think.
But we have to wait for
the rain to stop.
- Elin?
- Eh?
You should know that I don't care
what other people think of me.
I only care what she thinks.
- If she finds out that I'm still...
- She already knows.
She probably just wants
for you to stop lying.
Thanks.
Okay. Erh...
Sauna! The sauna! We have to go to the sauna!
Watch out!
No, no, no, no!
What the hell, we have to take Ava!
- Kirsten, Kirsten, Kirsten!
- Take her in! I'm coming!
Ouch! Ow!
Ow. Ow, ow, ow.
I'll be there soon.
Where is Kirsten?
- Oh my God!
- No, no, no, no!
You don't know what's out there.
No, no! Think about it, damn it!
Help me!
Elin! I saw her!
Kirsten!
- No, no, no! You can't!
- Elin, it's too late.
- She'll take you too.
- Elin, calm down. Quiet.
- Let me go! Let me go!
- I'll let you go.
Can I have the knife?
Sorry. Can I have the knife, please?
Please. Thanks.
Fucking bastards!
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
- No!
- What is happening? What is happening?
Elin?
What...
She is in shock. If we stay here,
she will die.
- Okay, so how do we get the boat in?
- Well, we'll have to swim.
- Are you sick in the head? Will you do it then?
- It's not that damn far out.
Then we have to lure her away
somehow.
We give her Ava.
- Are you serious?
- Inhumane, but what is the alternative?
I'm so fucking sick of you.
There's something about you that makes...
you constantly act
like a fucking cunt.
I can work something out,
but keep an eye on her-
- because she seems
completely fucking lost.
- What the hell are we doing?
- She will die anyway.
- You shout when I'm about to jump in,
don't you? - Yes.
Okay, run.
Okay.
Are you completely sick in the head?!
You fucking idiot!
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Whatever we do, she dies!
What is it you don't understand?
Stop it! She'll die anyway,
you said so yourself!
- Then let me go, you fucking cunt!
- That's the only way. We have a chance.
- You're killing her!
- I'm not going to die on that bloody island!
- Please! There is another way!
- Dimman! Are you ready?
- Please, let me go!
- o matter what we do, she'll die.
Dimman! Hello!
I'm going to swim! I'll do it!
Ava, grab it.
Come on. I've got you.
They're all fucking sick in the head.
That's it.
- Okay.
- You fucking bitch...!
- We have to get the boat in somehow.
- You know what?
When we get off this fucking island,
I never want to see you again.
I just want to go home, Elin.
Sorry.
But what should we do then?
What should we do?
We have to get the bait out further,
you understand.
Are you sure?
And.
You should know that everything I do now
is for you to survive, okay?
Okay.
It will be fine.
It's so fucking crazy.
We kind of tried to kill her.
We were both in it.
No! Wait, wait!
There must be another way!
It will be fine. You have to trust me
I can't save your leg.
I have to do this
if you're going to have a chance.
She must lie down!
Okay, okay.
Fuck! Eh...
Okay.
Okay, now! Now! Go get it!
Do it.
Think it's too heavy?
Okay.
Okay...
It's okay to be scared, Elin.
Yes, I'm afraid.
And there is no witch.
It won't work.
Now, Elin! Elin, now!
Dimman! No!
She's coming!
Dimman, hurry! Dimman!
Faster! She's coming! Quick...
Nice! Fuck, you're good.
We'll put her here for now.
I'm faster than you.
I know you won't believe me,
but...
There was a woman who was tortured
with a mask and drowned herself in the lake.
It's not a ghost story,
it's real.
Her name is Märit and she's trying
to kill us. Don't come here...
Get in the boat. Sit down!
Give me my mobile.
I thought you were the worst online,
but you're worse in real life.
Here, take your fucking mobile.
It's the only thing you have.
Let's go.
What's wrong?
Nothing, it's just...
Fuck...
If it starts raining, we're dead anyway.
No, she's holding on to me!
- I've got you!
- Help! Help me!
Take my hand!
Stop!
Okay.
- Ava?
- No...!
- Ava!
- Ava?
Ava?
Ava!
Ava? Ava!
Ava!
- Ava!
- Ava?
- Ava?
- We have to get up.
- Ava!
- Ava! Ava!
- Ava?
- Ava!
Elin! I've got her!
I've got her, Elin!
I've found her! - Ava?
Hurry up!
Jens! Hurry up!
Hurry up! Jens!
Jens.
- Jens.
- Jens!
Run.
Jens!
Run!
- What are you doing?!
- We have to wait out the rain.
She has to get out of here to survive.
You saw what happened to Jens.
We have to go in.
- I'm telling you no!
- Let her go!
Josse, help me.
Where is the router?
In the shed. That's what the old man
said when we got here.
There is no witch. The rain doesn't
matter, so we're not safe here.
- We have to get out of here now.
- We're not leaving until it stops raining.
Can't you hear what I'm saying?
The rain doesn't matter!
If you don't believe that,
why did you chop off Ava's leg?
Because if I hadn't,
you would have fucking killed her.
We reset the router
and then we call for help.
No, no...
I'll fix the router.
Can you see anything?
It's too dark.
What are you doing? Yes.
Yes, yes. Genius, Jossan.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Come on, Elin.
Come on, damn it.
- Is that something?
- Where?
- There.
- I don't know. Zoom.
- I don't see anything.
- Yes, you do. There, on the right.
It just looks like branches.
Those aren't branches. There she is.
Fuck. Elin.
No! Shit!
Elin! Elin!
Elin, she's coming! She's coming, Elin!
Elin! She's coming, Elin!
I saw Kirsten.
Kirsten is in there.
- Where, in there?
- In there.
- What happened?
- I think I killed her.
- What, Märit?
- There is no Märit!
Can you forget that fucking witch?
I don't know... I killed someone.
I have no fucking idea
what it is, but it's not a witch!
Okay. Elin. Let's go. Let's go.
We're leaving now. Let's get out of here.
Come on!
Help me.
Let's go. Ava. Come on. Come on.
Wait. I have wifi.
112. What happened...
It got cut off.
Sit down.
Sit down!
As usual,
I have to clean up after you.
How did you intend to solve this?
I don't know.
Take them down to the basement,
and I'll sort this out.
This is totally fucked up.
Why would you
kill her on the island?
She pulled my mask off.
She saw me. But it wasn't
supposed to happen.
But now it is what it is. It...
Please.
I promise not to tell anyone.
You don't get it.
That's why we brought you here.
The idea was for you to tell.
But now it's too late.
Uhh...
The witch...
The witch takes everyone.
Yes.
I get it.
Yes?
And what do you get?
You needed a... you needed...
a story that was just yours.
'Märit in the lake', so that your campsite
doesn't go bankrupt.
So you think this is about
a fucking campsite? Huh?
All this fine, beautiful scenery
that you've seen...
The lake and the forest.
All that will disappear.
The bloody mining company is just waiting
for us to go bankrupt...
so they can buy up everything
and make a big fucking dump out of it.
So it's not about money.
It is about our life.
Jossan. Jossan.
It's okay.
It will be fine.
It will be okay, I promise.
No! No!
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no...
- What do you think the kid will say about this?
- Well, it'll all work out.
You know, the witch took them all.
It would be good if you talked to
him first. He's pretty upset.
But he'll understand.
No one will believe you.
Nobody questions a good story.
And that's exactly what you will be.
You disappear, but your films are found.
And it will be content,
what is left of you.
Then do it, you fucking...
No. Ava!
Ava!
Uh...
We're going home, Ava. Just a little more.
Ava. Ava. Look at me.
Ava.
Oh, no. I can't stand it.
No.
Ava? Ava. Ava!
You must wake up!
Ava, please, please, please!
You must wake up!
Ava, please, please, please!
Please Ava, please, wake up!
No. No. No. Ava!
Oh no, no. Ava, please!
Ava!
Fuck.
It's uphill. It's uphill.
- Oh, Elin...
- No.
- I can't take it anymore.
- Yes, you can.
Up. You can, can't you?
Hang onto me. Hang on!
That's it. You're doing great.
Come on.
It wasn't supposed to be like this.
I saw you in the picture.
I realized that…
someone could get hurt,
but not like this.
- Nobody was meant to die.
- Please, Jens, why did you...?
It would have saved us.
Like with that woman in Serbia.
The tourists would come if it felt
real. We would be completely safe.
It's over now.
Can't we just please go home?
What is it you don't understand?!
Now everything is ruined!
It doesn't have to be.
I get it. You're a victim too.
- What should I do now?
- Everything will be okay. I promise.
It's not your fault. They were crazy.
They weren't crazy! There was a point
to everything, there was a plan!
- It just went wrong!
- That's not what I meant.
I know. I know, but that's what
we have to make everyone else believe.
It will be fine, I promise.
I won't let anything happen to you.
I promise. You just have to trust me.
No. It's not possible.
It's not possible. No one will believe me.
I must carry on.
Elin.
Forgive me, Elin.
- Say hi to my followers!
- Here is Dimman!
We are on our way to the sickest
place. It's going to be so cool.
You will of course be able to join in
on all the adventures.
