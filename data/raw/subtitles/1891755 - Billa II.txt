Muthu, get his photo clicked
Come... follow me

Baby is hungry
When will we get milk?
As if you'll die, if you

lt's better to die than
deal with these people!
What?
This is the place
Get lost
Are you new to this place?
- What's your name?
- David Billa
Muthu, do you want
another hard whack?!
Poking fun at me?
Raghubir sir is unaware
that you sneaked on him
That's why you are still alive
lf he did, that's it!
You can't scare me away
by such empty threats!
Let's see how long
you wag your tongue!
l'll get back at you
Look how terrified
4 tea
David, we have no way out
You said you've got a sister
You could go, stay with her
No one understood me
in my family
l don't know if they will now
But l must give it a try
Bro, special tea for you
From the day you hit Muthu,
you are truly revered!!
Hand me the torch
- This fellow?
- Not him, sir
- This one?
- He's blind, sir
Where is he?
He must be somewhere here
Look over here
- Get up, rascal!
- Not him either, sir
What the hell?
- ls he the one?
- He's new, sir
- Then who?
- He's the one, sir
David...don't
What will you do?
Shut up and sit quiet
You are my drug peddler
and you are sneaking on me!
This is a lesson for all of you
if you try to betray me
Muthu, drop him into the sea
Raghdev Sinha
Supervisor of this camp
This is what happens
if you oppose him
Hey you!
Come here
Yes...you
Come to the station with me
What's the issue, sir?
An accused has escaped
Stay inside for 2 days
l'll ensure you are paid
No, sir
l need to go to work
l wasn't asking you
l'm ordering you
l can't, sir
- Hey!
- Leave me, sir
What do you
think of yourself?
Let go, sir
How dare you refuse?
Rascal!
We are refugees
But not orphans
David...don't
Let go of him
l could only do this much
lf you want to do anything
further, he'll be out in 4 days
Take care of him then!
Where did your
orphan dialog get you?
Who rushed to your aid?
Come out
You'll get what you deserve
We need 5 volunteers
for lime wash?
Didn't l tell you that
they use us for daily labor?
White vest
Blue
3 people for carpentry
You go
3 for lron smith
That tall chap
Green ...fatso
That's it for today
lf l need anymore
l'll let you know...go
Better give my commission
as soon as you get paid
Or else, you'll see my cruel side!
Keep that in mind...go...go
Bro, l had reserved
a good job for you both
But you are walking away
Will you take it up?
lf it is a good salary!
Be ready
l'll take you
Greetings, Bai
Muthu...
-Greetings, Bai
What took you so long?
These are the 2 fellows
l told you
David
Ranjith
Greetings!
What can we do for you?
l got a whole load
of fish from Madras
Sudden lorry strike
l don't know what to do
Perishable commodity
lf you deliver it on time
l'll be relieved l kept my word
Okay, how much
will you pay us?
Usually Rs 3000
Since there's a strike
l can make it Rs 3500
Rs 5000
Muthu, your chap is
asking way too much
Won't you throw your fish-load
into the sea if they are spoilt?
Bhai, just say yes
We'll make it up
in consecutive trips
Muthu, you did what
you said you would
l've organized the en route operation
lf the load reaches you gain
lf it doesn't twice the gain
You leave now
l'll keep you posted
David, you should've slapped
Muthu a couple more times
Why?
lf one slap could
get us Rs 5000...
...2 slaps would have
got us Rs 10,000 each
He relented, as soon as you said
the entire fish load will get spoilt
Their fear is our power!
David, let's finish this job,
live it up, in Madras for a week
...and then return
l can also visit my sister
Stop the vehicle
Hey! Switch off the engine
Get down...both of you
- What are you carrying?
- Suffering from cold, sir?
Mockery?
No...this stink can
be smelt miles away
- Fish...can't you smell it?
- Raju, check the load
Sir... Diamond
What happen?
We caught them red-handed
- Kill them both
- Okay, sir
David, if 1 fish has
so many diamonds...
...imagine how valuable
the entire load wll be
When polished, just think
what a jackpot!!!
lf we sell this, we can easily
line our nest for a lifetime
Let's deliver the stuff
at the given address
Queen Kausalya's endearing
son, Sri Rama! Wake up, dear
You must do your day-to-day
duties, do wake up please
Thiruchitrambalam
Bro, up and about so soon?
Hey! Sornamalai!
Serve coffee with fresh milk
Okay Bro!
Opened so early?
Though we keep nose-crying
we must keep our nose to grindstone!
That's so true
Dosa master! Don't add salt
to the batter, l already did
Eggplant, raw banana load
has just arrived, l think
Shall l call later?
- Okay...
- l'll call you later
- Don't forget
- Sivachidambaram
Thiruchitrambalam
No sir, Rameshwaram
l welcomed you
in pure Saivite Tamil
You should reply Sivachidambaram
Sivachidambaram?
Then...Selvaraj?
l That's what folks call me
What will you eat?
Fluffy ldli like jasmine,
soft rice fritters, dosa?
l brought fish...
Fish...wrong address
l'll take leave
Son...come here
l am the right Selvaraj
Aren't you Bhai's hench-man?
Yes
Bring the vehicle
to the rear side
l'll meet you there
- Rear side means?
- Back side, l say
Our daily almanac is to be read and
approved by you...wake up Lord Balaji
Place it over there
and wash your hands
Selva...we are ruined
The whole load went kaput
l don't get you!
l trusted them and
sent you the goods
They just swindled it all
lf ever l catch them, l'll ensure
l chop them with a Viking battle-axe!
Who should be chopped, Bhai?
l swear l didn't know
the police would check, David
Trust me, David
Bro, tell him
Police...check post...oil
They are just youngsters
lgnore them
Come in
- How is Raghubir?
- Looks like even you distrust me!
We've minted money together
Would l ever backstab you?
Eat this betel leaf
- Selva...
- Go ahead
Lotus hidden bees sing solemn hymns
Oh Srinivasa, You are omnipotent
Sornamalai! There's a dead
lizard inside, get rid of it
Where do you intend staying?
We plan on a rejuvenating massage
Then we'll head back to our camp
This is for you
We've already been paid!
This is for a job to-be-done!
Face me...the girl from Madurai
Hug...embrace me...just try
Pure jasmine...sweet marjoram
Touch...nip me, no need decorum
My half-sari slid...wrenched,
for my thirst to be 1st quenched
For you, an angel appeared
ldeal age to be favoured
Your needle sharp eyes
drew many hamlets in a queue!
Thanks to you, heart-a-wanton
On a mind-boggling mission
ln our chariot of bliss
Climb in, dear prince
lf clouded with doubt
here, you can work out
On my nimbus body
your melody
Change into rain
Come down to rule again!
Your love has no clout here
Only your money we revere
A bewildered war zone is this place
lf you give in here, you win the race
This is an equal bed
where no one is graded!
- Don't wash away the diamonds
- David...careful
Father?
Mother?
Are you an orphan?
Uncle...
David?!
lt's been way too long...
- How are you, da?
- l am doing good
When did you come?
A while ago
- How are you, sis?
- Surviving!
l'm glad at least now
you thought of me
How are you, Jasmine?
l am fine, David
What did you get for me?
Why do you ask this
everytime he comes?!
What's wrong?
l've rights
lt's okay, she's only asking me!
Where you should
hold a bible in your hand
...you've come armed with a gun
You'll never reform, David
Why are you mad at uncle
when he's come after so long?
Don't scold him
Just shut up
Uncle, don't take it to heart
You know how my mother is!
- Use this money
-No, just visit us often.That's enough
Boss...
Hey! Milk is over-boiled!!
-Thiruchitrambalam
-Greetings
Koteeswar Rao, you've come
at this hour, in your best outfit?
For a specific reason, bro
Take a seat
These are all our boys
This is David...
Ranjith...Raam
David, this is Koti
An old friend of mine
Now in Goa
How is your boss, Abbas?
He's happy
l'm only stuck...
What's hassling you?
l brought powder for 1 crore
'Party missing' in the last minute
l am at a loose end
Have you stashed it
safe and sound?
Take it and go back
to Goa in one piece!
No bro, very tough
to take it back...
l was wondering if l could
pass it on to someone here
Please help me out, bro
Oh God save me! Powder
and l are poles apart!
l'll seal the deal for you!
David, do you know what
you are letting yourself in for?
We should change
our job with the times, bro
That's being shrewd!
Or else we'll be extinct
David's very enthusiastic
Come to this venue
by 10-00 P.M tomorrow
Meanwhile l'll talk to my boss
Sivachidambaram
David, l appreciate your courage
But l feel you maybe
a little too avaricious
Not greed, bro
Hunger!
David, why?
lf we meet him ahead of time
he'll be callous towards us
lf we arrive 10 minutes late
he'll think we are irresponsible
That's why on the dot 10-00
will assure him of our intention
Sharp 10-00
Hi David...welcome
Care for a Scotch?
l gargle only with Scotch!
Shall we get to the point?
l've spoken to my boss
This is heroin.
Worth 1 crore
lf you clinch the deal
you get Rs 50,000
5%
Wait...wait...okay
Finish the deal
Come to Goa
And collect your share
Have you informed
your boss of the 5% ?
He won't take any decision
without discussing with me
How do you know
who your buyer is?
lt is only tough to find
good people...bye
Ranjith, you and Ram stay here
Kadhir, come with me
Boss is inside
Go in
Here he is
Gun timing!
Name?
What have you brought?
- Hey! Lottai...
- Bro...
Check this
Check this
Keep it in
What are you waiting for?
Clear the place
Money
Money?
What gall, guts and spunk
you have to come to MY area
...and ask ME for money?
Go back in 1 piece, da!
Hey! Nitwit
Won't you pay us
after taking our stuff?
Wash your mouth!
l'll take your knee apart
Be still, da
l told you to go back in 1 piece
Now see this sliced state!
Stop...STOP
You asked my name...
Billa
David Billa
Let's go
So you are David?
Ranjith
Koti told me about you
Did you meet him?
l've met you, right?
Sir...
Abbasi, my consignment has started
Dimitri, don't worry
l'll do my best
- l understand the seriousness
- l'll call you back
Sure
Are you thinking l'm returning
your own stuff back to you?!
Unbelievable!
A special gift...for you
David, meet Samira
My girl friend
Okay, we'll meet up this
evening, come to my club
Somehow or other in a hazy daze
Somewhere in the wind it dilates
lt lures you into its spell
Heart slips out of its shell
This is...a whole new world
Though eyes wide open,
dream-world unfurled
l like the way you move
You like the way l move
Why don't we dance
together all night long?
A hug let me squeeze
to tease...please
Bounce, bounce, bounce with me?
Bounce, bounce, bounce with me
Seeing is not believing
lt is make-believe lying!
Beyond your eyes...read
Lies as naked truth indeed
Whatever be your desire
savor from this supplier
My heart's habitude
to fake...hey dude!
lf stars in your eyes, on a high
today is yours on a high five
lf you win, then automatically
this world surrenders totally
Your life fractured to fragments
Hand-in-hand nurture moments
Let's see a whole new world
splendidly unfold
Bounce, bounce, bounce with me?
Bounce, bounce, bounce with me
David, had a good time?
Do you like my club?
You personally own paradise
and if you ask me this question...
There's more for you to see
Why don't you stay
for a while with me?
Dimitri...
Excuse me
Hello Dimitri!
Awesome
Okay...l'll think about it
Anything serious?
Dimitri's arms consignment has
been ceased by the coastal guards
He wants us to help him
He's willing to pay 20 crores
Don't Abbasi, we don't know
anyone in that department now
Arms prevention act is very rigid
Aspiring for 20 crores...
...we shouldn't end up in
lnterpol's most wanted list
Where is that consignment now?
We've covered the whole place,sir
They are still inside, sir
Yes, sir
David, l felt rejuvenated
with you being here with me
Mr Praveen, don't forget me
after this deal
Let's see
Koti, you are bringing
our future chief minister
Are you planning
to enter politics?
He wanted to talk
to you personally
Do you need our help
for the coming election?
As long as the present
Chief minister is in power...
...l can't earn a single
rupee like l anticipated!
l want my son Satish
to learn the ropes from you
He can learn a lot
He can earn a lot
Bad idea!
This boy bonding
with us is a bad idea?
No, us being with this boy
David, you don't realize
we'll get Govt. backing
We have the power
You have the courage
No one can shake us
There's more to this business
than mere power and courage
Requires other skills
l've been submerged in
politics for past 30 years
Are you implying that
l'm not adequately qualified?
lf you mess up, you'll only
lose your designation
ln this business
lives will be lost
Abbasi, l'm not here
to talk to him!
Abbasi, you've disgraced me
Be prepared to face
the consequences!
Yes, Jasmine
David...
David...Jasmine
Hello Jasmine!
Grant unto her Eternal rest, oh Lord!
Let perpetual light shine upon her
Accept this soul, O merciful God by
the infinite merit of your precious blood
Through Your pious supplication,
grant her pardon for all her sins
...we commit her body to the ground
earth to earth, dust to dust
Amen
This house is beautiful
Hey! lce cream!!
Jasmine, this is Mrs Pedro
She'll take good care of you
Then aren't you
staying here with me?
l'll stay with my boss
in the guest house
David, Abbasi is waiting for us
l'll be there
l thought you'd be with me
You seem to have other plans
Fill up the college
application form
Hello
Welcome...welcome. Have a seat
- How is Dimitri?
- He is happy
For retrieving their consignment
as agreed, cash has been deposited
And a special gift from Dimitri
Let the danger be safe with you
Dimitri wants you to come to
Barovia to discuss further business
Dimitri wants you to come to
Barovia to discuss further business
Definitely, Koti will
come on my behalf
- See you in Barovia
- Have a safe trip back
See you, my friend
Koti, David will accompany you
Take Bobby also with you
He knows the language
Dimitri seems virtuous
But he is such a villain
Be on your guard
You go...l'll see you in a bit.
So...what have you decided?
The deal is not worth it.
Do you think we are fools?
Fine, l'll find somebody else
What does he think of himself?
So, what do we do now?
This won't work. He is useless!
ldiot!!
Wait
Who said that?
l know you'll order
just ice-cream
lce cream!
l'm off to Barovia on work
Take me with you
- l said, 'on work'!
Why don't you guys
get what l am saying?
So what?
Why can't l come?
Okay, l'll see you at 8:30 P.M
Sameera!
- David?!
How are you?
- Good!
Shopping?
Just came here to meet a friend
Jasmine...Sameera, my friend
Sameera...Jasmine
Alright, David
l'll see you later
So this is Sameera?
Now l get it!!
Dimitri, meet our friends
from lndia, Bobby...Koti...David
Go and check the consignment
- Okay
So you are David!
l heard about you
He's asking you to
take a look at his factory
This is my factory
M4 900 bullets per minute
$70 million turn over
M4 900 bullets per minute
$70 million turn over
Total $300 million
turn over per year
Boss
Just take a look
l'll be right back
Do arms command
such a steep price in the market?
Price is for death, not arms
As long as death exists,
market for weapons will thrive
Do you like my factory
He wants to know
if you like his factory
Very much, l think we should
take our business to the next level
David, Dimitri will call and
discuss details of the deal
Don't take any decision
without consulting Abbasi
He sent you just
as a companion.Don't forget that
Scared?
Don't be present when
l discuss the terms, stay away
l didn't mean it that way
Dimitri wants you in
He's willing to do anything
for us for our help
Thank you, we want to ...
do arms business with you
Okay, l don't mind
doing business with you
But make sure my 1st consignment
...passes lndian waters
lt's worth $500 million
Will do
Hello, Dimitri
Jagdish, my friend
lnterpol officer
This is David
Abbasi's main man
He's going to be handling
our new business
l've heard of him
Smart guy
You are at the right time
at the right place
Yes...but he has some
people not right, around him
That mongrel was
an lnterpol informer
ln my department
Money was being sent through me
He had no clue!
What's the use of you going
if such a deal was struck?!
He didn't pay heed to
even a single word l said!
Koti, did you give him tips
on developing our business?
He seems angry?!
David, why did l
send you to Barovia?
l have my doubts on you
Did that doubt creep
into your mind or Koti's?
Anyone will be suspicious
looking at your behavior
Abbasi, you know l don't
play cloak and dagger stuff!
l know Bobby even
before l knew you
A trust-worthy man
He is dead now
Trust-worthy?
Bobby?
Bobby was an lnterpol informer
He's been with us
right from childhood
He'd have never betrayed us
A traitor is always part
of a gang and 'trusted'!
You went to collect the payment
How could you finalize a deal?
l wanted to take the business
to another level, l did it for you
Do you know the turn over
per year for arms smuggling?
Profit can be whatever
How can you decide for Abbasi?
This is between
you and me, Abbasi!
What's wrong in what Koti says?
What do you know about Dimitri?
Dealing directly with him is hara-kiri!
Abbasi, trust me
l don't want to get into trouble
because of this, be careful
Jasmine
What are you up to?
What do you want?
Beat the hell out of him
Don't leave him
Come and lie down beside me
Are you leaving?
l know where you are off to
l'll only be with you
Till my last breath in my body
l'm the only one with you
Abbasi, put David in his place
My department is distraught
over David's behavior
ln a public place, he has hit
son of a minister Praveen Kumar
lf l does anything further and
l take action, you'll be in a soup!
Don't blame me then, okay?
l told you...you didn't listen
Here he comes sauntering in
At least ask him now
What fire are you kindling now, Koti?
Thanks to you, one who should
be saluting me is sitting with me
...and issuing a warning!
What did l do?
- Why did you hit Satish?
- He misbehaved with Jasmine
- Who is Jasmine?
- That's personal
What is personal?
Praveen Kumar is
already mad with us
He has hit his son too
Do you know whose
business this will affect?
'My business'?!
You have something else
on your mind
Be upfront
l don't have hide and
talk to my henchman
l...who was your friend when
l saved Dimitri's consignment
...now do l seem
like your henchman?
You are crossing your limit, David
Abbasi, you are talking with
a pre determined conclusion
lf Billa be friends
he'll give even his life!
lf we become your enemy
will you take our life?
lf necessary
David will do so
You don't exist without me
There is a difference between
one who gets a job done...
...and one who wagers
his life, remember that!
l've made up my mind
Hereafter we'll ourselves
handle this drug business
David, don't take any decision
when you are emotional
lt will go wrong
This is when we should
make the right move
How much money
we've earned for them?
So what?
He's in this business
for donkey's years
Do you think
he'll let you thrive?
- He won't
- Then?
Neither should we give in!
Okay, so what's the plan?
During the carnival we kill
the Russian drug dealer
So...you want to start
business on your own?
Smart move!
But do you think you can
do it without Abbasi?
Good job!
Abbasi, your job is done
l'll call you back
Still alive
Kill him!
l'm proud of you, Ram
Good job
This is for you to go to Canada
just as you wanted!
This is for accepting my contract
This is for completing
what you accepted
Thank you, Abbasi
Tariq!
Abbasi...what is this?
What is the assurance that
what you did to David today...
... tomorrow, you won't
do the same to me?!
l told you right then, there is a difference
between one who gets a job done...
...and one who wagers his life
Abbasi...you under-estimated David Billa!!
Why?
Yes...l should have killed you myself
My fault to have
trusted someone else
l won't apologize to you
Shoot...
Shoooot!
David...he threatened
to kill me...that's why!
To win we can kill 1000 enemies
Not wrong
But to let 1 traitor live is a huge blunder!
The beast inside you deep
may decide to sleep...
lf it wakes up to walk
volcanoes will spark
When dreams as feelings favor
beast within quivers with fervor
Swallow you without a flutter
Gift you on a golden platter!
Without smoking the bee
nectar is no guarantee
A ball without a kick
won't bounce double quick
Only pain is balm to the soul
This is nature's untold rule
lf you too live in hell
you become a beast as well
Sacrifice a life to create terror
Repeatedly...another head to sever
World is not round nor uniform
Blurred shadows have no form
Break the norms of grammar
Knock at the roots and hammer
No friend here to befriend
No foe to oppose or contend
You are your own faithful friend
as well as your foe till the end
Only pain is balm to the soul
This is nature's profound rule
With the 1st blow, quiver with fear
With the next strike, buckle under
lf he survives, hit again
Go for the jugular vein!
You must die repeatedly
to reincarnate undauntedly
Be alert even when asleep
with both eyes ready to leap
You are your own restriction
Your goal is your destination
When you touch, pain sears high
lt aches, but can't feel the agony
Only pain is balm to the soul
This is nature's enigmatic rule
Don't shoot, sir
Please sir...please
Dimitri
Welcome, my friend
Welcome to my world!
Arms consignment is ready
As per our discussion...
...you promised you would
help us cross the lndian waters
Will do
As always
lf you get it done
as you wanted...
...we can work together
My share?
5%
30%
Just because you replaced Abbasi,
don't assume you can dictate terms
Without me, your consignment
will not even move one inch!
30% ?
My consignment will reach
Azania even without you!
- Sir...your cheque?
- Sure
- Thank you
- With pleasure
Govt. does not have enough
money or schemes to help the poor
David Billa has now donated to
our state welfare fund Rs 1 crore
lf other rich industrialists follow suit
...they will feel good and
also be helpful to the Govt.
l look forward to more
such contributions
Thank you
l am so happy
you graced this occasion
Rs 1 crore for your state welfare fund
That's for the public
l am ready to give you whatever,
how much ever, whenever you want
lf you had come up the hard way
you won't be saying such things
You were a gangster who became
a VlP the short cut, crooked way!
Be it a business man or a millionaire...
...even a beggar has to work hard
Money doesn't come easy, sir
You are the chief minister
You serve the people
and our country
But you still need gangster like me...
...to do your dirty job, sir!
To handle your enemies, you need
the help of a gangster like me
You've misunderstood me
This CM is not for sale
My lntelligence wing
has been updating me
...all the necessary
information about you
Just 1 evidence to pin you
You'll end up in prison
Understand?
Get the lntelligence Wing's file
on David Billa, it is very urgent
David...come
Let us go down
You go
l'll follow
Come on, David
The guests are waiting
Leave me alone for a while
Why? What did the CM say?
Sir, shall l deposit Billa's
cheque in the bank...or...?
Send the file to my table
and the cheque to the bank
Sure sir.
Ranjit
controversial businessman
and prime accused...
David Billa has been arrested...
...and taken into judicial
custody for 15 days
He's expected to appear
in the court tomorrow
Regarding this,
the general secretary...
Praveen Kumar of the ruling party
addressing a press meet...
Regarding this murder,
l want proper action to be taken
l want the culprit to be
punished accordingly
ln the general body meeting, candidate for
the new chief minister will be nominated
l request the people
not to lose faith in us
l humbly ask you
to maintain peace
Mr Minister, no one
can match your talent
What do you mean?
For Dimitri,
Billa should not be alive
For you to
become Chief Minister...
...this CM should not be alive!
You've finished 3 issues
Here after Dimitri's
business in lndia...
...will be handled only by us!
Don't rejoice too soon
Billa is not dead
He is only in jail
He cannot come out
He has applied for bail
So what?
There are many who witnessed him
threatening the Chief minister
Besides that, the evidence
we concocted is strong
How can he come out?
lf beyond all this,
he comes out...
...then us taking this money
from you will be meaningless!
Your Honor! l pray this court
to grant bail for my client...
Mr David Billa
l object, Your Honor
The accused David Billa has
said he was drunk that night...
...he threatened the Chief minister to
join hands with him in smuggling activities
Press and media have reported threats
made by him to the Chief Minister
lf granted bail, chances of...
...concrete evidence being
tampered by him are high
l request the Honorable court
to deny bail to David Billa
l find undue haste has been shown
by the police in arresting the defendant...
...without proper evidence
Until such evidence is produced
to the court l grant him bail...
...with a third party
surety of five lakhs
The court is adjourned
Praveen Kumar has utilized
your emotional speech...
...to the chief minister, to his advantage!
l thought l wouldn't
even be granted bail
How did you manage?
l followed your 'pearl of wisdom'
Others fear, our power!
Do understand l already have
the 1/3 majority to become CM
How can l give a minister's post
to every Tom, Dick and Harry?
There's no one else
more suitable for this post
Why? No gratitude?
ls that why you were
waiting for so many years?
Your desire to
become Chief minister
Your conspiracies
All that is politics
But sending me to jail
was height of stupidity
Are you intending
to kill me now?
To be my friend,
no qualification required
But you need capability
to be my enemy
You do not possess
those credentials
lf l had wanted, l could have
killed you when l was in jail
Don't talk nonsense, Bllla
lf anything happens to me
...there are more than 100000
people to give their lives for me
People will vote for you
Not sacrifice their lives!!!
Mr Praveen Kumar...David Billa
will not step into your territory
You...do not trespass
into David Billa's space
Koti, Billa just gave me a warning!
l want to hear the news
that he is dead
How are you, Jasmine?
l'm back
Why are you crying now?
l was praying that
you should come back soon
They said they will kill you.
The Minister and Dmitry were
together somehow.
They were both clearly
helping Billa escape.
- Leo?
- I've Coty here for you.
Hello, Coty. Yes.
Yes.
Minister Pravin Kumar
wants to talk to you.
Hello, Dimitriy.
I'm here to help you.
My heart nearly stopped, you know!
Jasmine, you get
scared too easily
David,
l didn't expect you back so soon
- How are you?
- l'm fine
Whatever it takes, before my ship
reaches lndian waters...
Don't worry
l'll take care of everything
Billa will not be alive
l don't care how much it costs
Jasmine, you go home
l'll come later
l knew you'd send me away
David, l think l disturbed you
in one of your happy moments
Who is this?
You don't need to know who l am
lf you don't come
to the place l tell you
...Jasmine will die for you!
Koti...
Look over there...car
Hello?
Sameera, start immediately
lf you are in the house
your life is in danger
Danger?
What happened?
First come to the place
l ask you to and take Jasmine
Jasmine?
Where should l come?
St Mary's church...
Jasmine, you shouldn't
be in lndia any longer
l want you to go to Malaysia
l've made all the arrangements
You want to send me away
and then live it up with her, right?
l'm doing this for your good
Hello?
l'll be with you only
lf you want,
send her to Malaysia!
l'm concerned about you
Why drag her into
our conversation?
l didn't drag her
You called and asked her to come
l won't go anywhere without you
Please understand
l don't want any harm to
befall you because of me
Sameera will come now
Go with her to safety
Okay, you want me to go
Fine, l'll go where you'll
never be able to see me!
David!
David!
How many times l've warned you
not to cross swords with me?
Your thought
you were over smart?!
You made Dimitri your enemy
We ganged up together
Now do you realize...?
Your time's up!
Did you ever
anticipate such an end?
Dai! My life...every day...
every moment...
...every second has
been chiseled by ME!
Kill him!
Don't spare him!
Kill that scoundrel!
What 'is' has now become 'was'
Thoughts of you are at a pause
My love for you l can't hide
You took me on a sky-ride
l love you to eternity
Why did you cheat on me?
My tears have dried, therefore...
l won't call you honey, anymore
l don't want to be with you anymore
lf l loved you before, now no encore
Deluge of tears, now stopped
Memories of you l've cropped
What 'is' has now become 'was'
What 'is' has now become 'was'
Thoughts of you are at a pause
Love has passed me by
Clouds are no longer in the sky
Fly fast to me, waiting for you...
Why do l still love you so true?
My friends, it's time to talk business
l know you are interested
to see what you've purchased
Though the value of the weapons l've made
for you is only 500 million dollars...
the power these weapons
will give you is invaluable.
Our chief is happy.
But he wants to know if his
shipment will arrive on time.
Your weapons are now.
The ship carrying them will
depart from the port in a few hours.
lt will sail through Japan, lndonesia,
Thailand and lndian waters.
l guarantee you it will arrive on time.
Let's see a live view of your
weapon's leaving my factory.
Dimitri, what the hell is this?
l made a mistake.
l believed him.
l also made another mistake
l didn't believe in him.
David...magnet
l promise you.
I will reach you in one hour.
Leo
Land the helicopter
Come out
The train should reach
the port at any cost
Follow the train
So...you finished
what you intended
This is the Beginning...
Gang...gang...gangster,
here comes the monster
Gang...gang...gangster,
you will surrender
Diligently, he chiseled his story
He signed in darkness his destiny
He kissed goodbye to pain
ln pain he found pleasure again
Don to be dreaded...
dread to get beheaded!
The mantle David Billa dons
is the best Don of all Dons
Don to be dreaded...
dread to get shredded!
Billa shares the fury
of a lion in a frenzy
Give your way...your way
to this gangster
Give your way...your way
to this monster
Even atop a volcano
he'll stake his claim
People all over respect
and revere his very name
Even God of death Yama
he'll con into a dreadful dilemma
Don to be dreaded...
dread to get beheaded!
