Are you all right?!
What are they, immortal?
This is bad. Get away from here!
Giant Sand Burial!
You're late, Gaara.
Who are these guys?
I don't know.
They just came out of the sea
when we set up camp for the night.
I'm not letting you get away!
Stop! Don't go after them!
We're at a complete disadvantage
at sea in the dark.
Release the light balls!
Yes!
What is that?
I've never seen
a boat like that before.
This is bad!
All right, go, go!
Hey! This is important.
Be quiet!
Honestly...
He went in!
We did it!
There, there. That's a good boy.
He has black fur on his back legs.
All right, it's him.
Naruto, the cage!
He's so stupid...
falling for such a stupid trap!
Huh?
What is it?
Hey, Naruto! What did you do?!
What did I do?
I just got the cage...
Oww!
You idiot!
Don't let him get away, Naruto!
I'll beat you if he gets away!
You idiot!
Geez. I don't know why someone
would bother paying us
to look for this vicious cat.
Well, don't sulk like that.
Our mission is to find him
and deliver him to his owner.
And he's not a cat. He's a ferret.
Looking closely at him,
he's pretty cute.
Anyway, let's deliver him
and get back to the village.
If we cross that bridge...
All right!
Hey, Naruto, wait!
Let's get this mission over with...!
What are you doing, you idiot?!
It's says there that
this bridge is dangerous!
I don't care about you,
but what would we do
if something happened to the ferret?!
Sakura, that's so mean.
Shikamaru?
What's wrong?
Well... Our request came from
the village beyond that field.
Don't you think it seems
kind of strange?
Strange?
It's noon, but it doesn't look
like anyone's there.
Come to think of it...
You think so?
Let's adopt scouting tactics
from here.
I'll head around to the forest
on the west.
Naruto and Sakura,
you head to the opposite side.
- Roger!
- Roger!
I hope this won't be a hassle....
It's beyond that forest.
Hey! Be quiet!
I wonder what's come over him?
What's this?
Hey...
Hey! What's wrong?!
Who are you guys?!
Naruto!
There are some strange people...
I'm heading there now.
What are they?
In that case...
All right!
U... Zu... Ma... Ki!
Naruto Barrage!
So you're the leader!
Why you!
Sakura!
Naruto!
Let go of me! Hey!
Crap...
Taking hostages is cowardly!
Let go of her right now!
Shadow Possession Jutsu...
Naruto! Leave these guys to me!
All right!
I don't care who you guys are!
I'm going to take care of you
all at once.
Multi Shadow Clone!
Here I go!
Rasengan!
Rising Thunder!
Naruto!
Crap...
Naruto...
Sakura! This way!
What is that?
Oww!
Now that you're up,
try not to move too much...
I didn't think that you'd wake up
for another two or three days, but...
Who are you, Gramps?
Me? I'm Kahiko,
the elder of this caravan.
Caravan?
That's right.
The people of the villages
call us the wandering people.
We travel all over the place,
depending on the season.
Oh?
You were lucky.
You would have been washed away
by the river if we hadn't passed by.
Hey! It's that guy!
Oh?
He's also regained consciousness...
Hey, hey, you!
Why the hell did you
suddenly attack me like that?!
My, my. It's good that
you're full of energy, but...
Anyway, you shouldn't fight.
We help each other as we travel.
But this guy...
Hey! It's you!
I can recover from
most of my wounds in a day.
That's convenient...
But that boy is also pretty impressive...
He's healing as quickly as you are.
Huh? Him, too?
I'm so envious of youth...
Gramps, be careful.
He's really violent.
Nerugui is shy,
but he doesn't bite people.
Do you know him?
Well, he's never left
the caravan until now.
Aren't you glad that
you got back safely, Nerugui?
He's our treasure.
I was the one who hired
the Leaf Village to search for him.
I see. So it was you...
We move all year,
so we wanted him delivered
to a village at the border.
How'd he turn up here again?
Well, that's because he suddenly...
Hey, Nerugui!
Is he really shy?
So I thought...
This area is crawling with those guys.
Yeah.
Who in the world are they?
Who knows?
Sakura, keep looking for Naruto.
If you find him,
inform me by intercom.
Right! What about you?
There's something that I have to do...
Come here...
Master Haido...
Say, say, say, say!
Has this caravan always
been traveling?
That's right. We've been on the road
ever since our country was destroyed.
Ever since your country
was destroyed?
It's a legend that has been passed down
by our clan from long ago.
It says that we had a country,
but it was destroyed.
Hmm... Why?
It seems that, long ago,
there was a great catastrophe.
We lost our country
and our clan was scattered.
We became wandering people...
And it seems that some of us
crossed the sea.
The sea?
That's right.
Nerugui is a ferret that
was kept at our ancestors' palace...
He's living proof that
we had a country long ago.
Gramps, you're kidding, right?
Then that means that
he's lived for a really long time.
Yes. He has lived for
a really long time.
Huh?
Nerugui is even older than Grandpa.
That's ridiculous...
Amazing, isn't it?
We've taken care of him
through the generations.
That's why Nerugui doesn't take
to anyone outside of our caravan...
Or so I thought...
Has he gone to him again?
Nerugui, what's wrong with you?
Hey, hey! Are you talking now?
Why did you suddenly attack me?
Hey! Don't ignore me!
What is your strange power?
Huh? Power? You mean Chakra?
Chakra?
Indeed, I don't sense any Gelel....
Hey, hey, answer my question.
Who the hell are you?
I came to build a utopia.
Uto... What's that?
You have an interesting power.
Come with me.
Huh?
I don't understand what
you're talking about!
Think about it.
No way!
Why do I have to go with you?!
I'm asking you
why you attacked me!
I'm going to tie you up
and take you to the Leaf Village...! Whoa!
Wait! Where are you going?
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Wait for me!
Are they all right?
Are they hurt?
They're okay?
They look all right.
What are you doing?!
Thank you very much.
Now, I've repaid my debt
to these people.
Geez. These guys just
keep on coming...
It doesn't look like
they're conscious.
How long am I going to
have to look after these guys?
Oh my. It's not good
to be short-tempered.
I know!
We won't need them
once we find the Stone of Gelel...
Just be a little more patient.
Well, we need them right now.
He ran away! That bastard!
I won't let you get away!
This is horrible...
Hey, what's wrong, Gramps?
Nerugui isn't here, either.
Does that mean that
he went with him?
Yes... What was the point of spending
a large sum of money
to hire the excellent Leaf Village?
Wait a second!
I just completed your request.
Be quiet. I told you to
deliver him to the next village.
Furthermore, Nerugui isn't here!
That's ridiculous...
If I knew this would happen,
I would have hired the even more
excellent Sand Village from the beginning.
Aw man!
I get it already, believe it!
Naruto....
There are signs that
someone was here....
Could it be?
I finally caught up to you.
Hey, hey! Give me back that cat.
Why you...
Wh-What is this?
Exactly who are you?
My name is Temujin...
Come! I'll introduce you
to Master Haido!
Huh?! H-Hey...
Hold on a minute!
Say, who is this "Master Haido"?
My lord and a person
with a wonderful belief.
You'll understand when you meet him.
Say, are you friends
with those strange guys?
They're just faithful soldiers.
My friends are...
I have returned.
Ah, Temujin.
You're back.
It's you, isn't it?
Temujin informed me that
you have an interesting power.
I shall show you right now.
Wha...?!
What's this?!
Now come on!
No! Stop this unnecessary fighting.
But...
No, fighting is not good.
Naruto, we have journeyed
to create a utopia.
What is a "utopia"?
Well...
Simply put, it is a world
where there are no wars
and the weak aren't oppressed.
A world without wars?
Yes... Our homeland...
is in a far-off continent with
continuous wars...
Wars are always unsightly
and sorrowful.
It brings misfortune to all people.
Temujin here also lost
his homeland to war.
Are you all alone?
I have Master Haido.
Temujin was left behind in
his war-torn village when he was young.
I made a decision.
I wanted to protect the weak...
I wanted to create a world
where no one had to fight.
That is utopia... My dream.
For the sake of my dream,
I've traveled the world
gathering comrades...
It has taken time to get this far.
Unfortunately, there were people who
became noble sacrifices along the way...
Say, Naruto, won't you come with me?
I want you to help me
make this world a better place.
Hmm...
I'd like to go,
but I've got to become Hokage.
Hokage?
The best Ninja in my village.
I see...
Well, I can't go with you,
but I'll also try my best
to make everyone in my village happy!
Then let's both give it our best.
- Huh?
- Oh?
What is that?
I'm very sorry.
He came along with me
from a caravan that I passed...
From a caravan?
I see.
A caravan?
Master Haido! Bad news!
What's wrong?
The fleet that landed in
the Land of Wind was annihilated.
Huh? The Land of Wind?
I'll go!
Hey! What happened?
Oh well, Fugai...
Yes!
There's somewhere
I want you to go.
What is this?
Hey!
What's the meaning of this?!
Answer me...!
Naruto!
Why are you here?!
You're from the Sand...
Well, that's fine.
You may have thought
that you could sneak up on us,
but don't underestimate
the Five Great Nations' Ninjas
of the Hidden Sand.
What in the world happened?!
Don't you know anything?
These people invaded
the Land of Wind out of nowhere.
What?!
We've had quite a few casualties
trying to stop them.
There are villages that were
caught in the battle and destroyed.
Hey! Is that true?!
They are noble sacrifices
to accomplish our goal.
You bastard! What you're saying
is different from what you're doing!
Sorry for butting in,
but I'm going to take him out now.
Don't interfere!
He's my opponent!
What?!
Those who interfere...
must be eliminated!
Bring it on!
You idiot,
what are you doing here?
Your primary duty is to scout.
This guy's a lookout.
There's another unit waiting nearby.
But...!
Why are you getting worked up?
We're leaving before
this becomes troublesome.
You're not getting away!
You're late as usual.
Oh well, I'll play with them.
Persistent ones make things
worse for themselves.
You... what in the world
are you thinking?
I already told you.
Proportionate sacrifices must be made
in order to achieve a large goal.
What?!
Weren't they your friends?!
They were.
And, from the bottom of their hearts,
they're giving their all for
our dream of a utopia.
No way!
What do you mean, "friends"?! How can
you say it with such indifference!
You're good at dodging.
If all you can do is make it dark,
you're not much of a showman.
These are people who
rebelled against us.
They are regretting their mistakes
as criminals in the Land of Death.
She's... a Genjutsu-user....
The power of time will make you
suffer in eternity.
It'll be too late to cry to me afterwards.
That's enough talk.
Bring it on now.
Tornado Lightning!
Sand Shower!
What's wrong?
Entertain me more!
Go on to the next world...
Thunder Saber!
That was easy...
Sand Burial.
It's useless to struggle...
So that's how you fight...
Geez. You're a difficult opponent.
This isn't over yet.
So you've got the ability
to increase your power
by changing your physical body...
That's right.
This is over.
Here I go!
It's useless.
That won't work against this Plasma Ball!
Take this!
How pathetic.
I got him...
Is this the first time
you've fought a Shinobi?
Wha...?
You're still alive?!
Sand Tsunami!
Your sand doesn't work
against my electric attacks!
If you have your electric attacks...
You can't defeat me!
Sand Lightning Rod.
Giant Sand Burial!
How terrible!
So this is where you were.
I'm not letting you get away.
I told you that persistent ones
only make it worse for themselves.
What's that?
That's pretty dirty!
Crap! Wait, you bitch!
What's this?!
Temujin, withdraw!
I won't let you!
I won't let you get away!
Hey, you idiot! Let me go!
I'm not going to!
Huh?
I... can't hold on...
Huh?
What are you doing here?!
Crap!
Where are the Gelel stones?!
Come now,
I wouldn't know about that.
Are you playing dumb?
Wh-What?
Shadow Possession complete...
Grandpa, are you all right?
We saw a pretty flashy signal flare...
New enemies?
Whoa. Your henchmen won't come
even if you call them.
They're just big and useless.
Wh-What?!
What was that? A wolf?
Get ahold of yourself.
Thank you...
Say, Gramps...
What is this "Stone of Gelel"?
Huh? Gelel?
Well, it's none of our concern...
I was just curious since I heard
the same term used in their stronghold.
Then does that mean
that it's connected to their goal?
Or it could be exactly
what they're after...
Well, it doesn't matter
if you don't want to tell us.
We've got to look for a friend...
Let's go, Sakura!
But...
Wait! Are you friends of Naruto?
Grandpa, do you know Naruto?
Please, help me...
At this rate,
something terrifying is going to happen...
Something terrifying?
What do you mean, "friends"?!
What do you know about me?
What'll we do, Temujin?
Everyone's dead...
Don't cry...
But...
This is dreadful...
You're the only survivors of this village.
This sort of misfortune
wouldn't happen in utopia.
Utopia?
It is the war-free world
I am trying to create.
Isn't it wonderful?
If I can only gather
a lot of these Gelel Stones...
I can rid this world of all wars...
Unsightly and sorrowful wars...
It's amazing that
you can adapt yourself
to the Stones of Gelel.
You think so?
It is. Temujin, I'm proud of you.
Thank you.
I'm not like you.
I only have power
when I go in here.
But our hearts are one.
After all, we're friends.
We mustn't let other villages
become like ours.
Let's give it our best...
For our utopia...
What's wrong?
You blind bastard!
That caravan you stopped by
had information on the Gelel Stones!
What?!
So the lead got away...
I had Temujin go after them.
I see. There was never a time
he didn't live up to my expectations.
That's because
Temujin has that power.
Hey! We've been waiting for you.
You bastard!
Do you know what you did?!
I have nothing to say to you...
What?!
Now hold on, Naruto...
Let me talk to him for a bit.
I didn't expect you to
have information on the stones...
So, why do you want
the Stone of Gelel now?
Because they're important.
You don't know
the horror of those stones.
We mustn't bring them back.
Are you lecturing me?
I thought so...
What is that?
This is a Crystal of Gelel,
the source of life energy.
I know more about
the stones than anyone.
I can see where
you got your recovery powers.
Where did you get that stone?
I received it from my lord,
Master Haido.
I see...
Is the stone only thing you have?
That's odd.
If you're the descendant of
our clan members who crossed the sea,
why don't you know that?
Was the Book of Gelel lost?
What in the world
are you talking about?
From ages past, the only ones
who could fuse their physical bodies
with the Gelel Stones were
the royal family of our clan...
Naruto, I told you a little about it, didn't I?
I told you that when we lost our country,
some of us crossed the sea.
Come to think of it...
According to legend,
it was the royal family of
our clan who crossed the sea.
They took with them
the last Stone of Gelel
and the Book of Gelel.
You said your name was Temujin, right?
You haven't come.
You've returned!
We are of the same clan.
No one knows how
that stone was created.
But it seems that, long ago,
the mysterious Mine was found.
Our ancestors refined that stone,
crystallized it,
and named the mineral "Gelel."
And we created an empire
on this continent
that was founded on the Gelel Stones.
We built wells that didn't dry,
livestock that grew overnight,
trees that continuously bore fruit.
And we even tried to find ways
to stop living things from aging.
That's the first I heard of that.
It was a long time ago.
But often,
great power brings catastrophe.
People fought and quarreled disgracefully
for the power of the Gelel Stones.
In the end, war was waged
with the stones' power.
Mountains and the earth split and,
finally, the battle obliterated the empire.
That's horrible...
Only a handful of young people survived.
Our ancestors sealed the Stone of Gelel
mineral deep underground
and vowed never to
revive the stones ever again.
Why didn't you try to rid yourselves
of such a terrifying thing?
Only the blood of the royal family
can destroy the stones.
We've lost the royal family,
so all we can do is watch over
the stones through the generations.
The legends were supposed
to fade and be lost, but...
Fade? Destroy? Never.
Hearing that, I made up my mind.
I'm going to get those stones,
no matter what.
You bastard... Weren't you listening?!
Power is only power.
What matters is who uses it.
It's a power that is beyond
what humans can handle.
You mustn't revive the stones!
Whatever power it may be,
Master Haido will use it in the right way.
Master Haido said,
"Wars only breed misfortune.
"But wars can't be stopped
without someone standing at the top."
The truth of those words
deeply touched my heart.
In the confusion of war,
my village was attacked
by a gang of thieves.
We survivors were orphaned and
Master Haido adopted us.
I want to grant Master Haido
his wish to free the world of wars.
My friends all think the same.
No matter what the sacrifice...
this is my dream and I need
the Stone of Gelel to achieve it!
He was faking it
from the beginning!
You bastard...
Now... Tell me where
the Mine of Gelel is.
I refuse...
Oh well.
My eyes!
Crap! What was that?
Quickly, let's go after him!
Emina, where is the Gelel Stone Mine?
Sorry. Only Grandpa knows where it is...
If only we had a Ninja Hound...
You...
So this is it...
Sorry for treating you roughly...
Now, go!
How is it?
Everything is ready.
Good.
Then let's move out.
Where's he running? I can't tell!
Right now, he's our only hope!
Is that an exit?!
Naruto! Do something!
That way!
You should know. Show me the way!
This way...
Wait!
Let go of Gramps!
You're in the way!
Wh-What is that?
Master Haido...
The Mine of Gelel is down here.
Thank you, Temujin.
I've put you through
so much trouble.
Thanks to you,
our utopia is right before our eyes.
Yes!
Everyone, let us go.
Hold on a second!
Sorry, but I have some things
I want to ask you.
Master Haido!
It's all right, Kamira.
Hmm... How troublesome.
Is this rude person your friend, Naruto?
What are you doing?
We made a promise.
That we would both try our best
to make a better world.
I'm the one who wants
to know what you're doing!
What do you plan to do
once you get the Stone of Gelel?
What will I do?
I'm going to create a utopia.
A world without wars
where the weak aren't oppressed.
I wonder. You look like you're doing
the complete opposite of that.
It is all in the name of true justice.
Then why did you attack
a defenseless village and caravan?
I had no choice.
We've made great sacrifices too.
These are all noble sacrifices
to make a world without wars.
Hey! Old man!
What are those "noble sacrifices"?
Do you sum them up
as "noble sacrifices"
even if it's your friends
who have fallen?
That's what it means
to accomplish something.
You, too. Are you okay with
your friend being treated like that?!
That's right.
That's what everyone has decided,
including me.
It can't be helped.
As friends, we share the dream
of a peaceful utopia.
Then you're no friend!
Why?
I don't know for sure...
But, to me, a friend is someone
you should cherish more!
I was always alone...
But I made friends and
was no longer alone.
That's why my dream
is to become a Hokage
who protects everyone in my village,
where my friends are!
Who is your utopia for?!
Any dream that doesn't cherish friends
is good for nothing!
I'll crush it!
Wha...?!
What are you doing?!
That thing should be eliminated
from this world...
Along with us!
Gramps!
Eliminate the stone?!
There is no way...
What does he know?!
Hurry! We are going after them!
Master Haido! To the stronghold!
There's not enough time!
Bring the stronghold with you!
Wait!
I'll deal with you, boy!
What nerve!
Naruto, go!
Crap...
Hold it!
Where are we?
According to legend,
this is the Chamber of Sealing.
Everything is as the legend says.
It's the first time I've come here,
but it feels kind of familiar...
These were written by our ancestors
when they sealed away this place.
It tells of the terrible power
of the Gelel Stones.
What's this?
It seems to be a depiction of despair.
The empire was probably obliterated,
just like in that picture...
How promising! It would have been
meaningless if we came this far
only to find the power of Gelel
wasn't what we expected.
Don't you think that this is terrifying?!
This tremendous picture proves
that this great power can
only breed destruction...
People will fight with or
without the power of Gelel.
We just have to use it
in the right way.
I see...
The Stone of Gelel is further down,
but our journey...
ends here!
Little girl, you'll die if you interfere!
Come on, what's wrong, boy?
Entertain me more!
Where are the shadow techniques
you're good at?
Crap! She keeps flying around...
What should I do? Think!
How's that?!
Little girl!
I blinded her.
How is she chasing me?
The smell of your blood
tells me where you are.
It's useless to hide...
Little girl... There you are!
Farewell!
Damn it! Little girl!
You think that you've caught me?
Whoa! You shouldn't move!
Oh, an escape opening...
Just kidding.
Your shadow is waiting there, isn't it?
So many holes.
Your shadow can't reach me from here.
Adios...
Hey, let me out! Let me out!
Secret Black Move Iron Maiden 2.
It's just as I planned, I suppose.
You saved me.
I had a score to settle with her.
That aside, we can't move recklessly
with all these paper bombs around.
Oh... Most of these are
just regular pieces of paper.
Really?
How foolish.
Did you think that you could defeat me
with a surprise attack?
It's probably impossible...
But I've achieved my goal.
What?
Do you know what
the design on this floor is?
It's an ancient Summoning Jutsu formula
to summon a certain something.
What are you thinking?
Now be destroyed with me!
I don't know what
he was trying to do...
But it seems that I made it just in time.
Master Haido...
Are you all right, Temujin?
Master Haido, that just now...
Oh...
It was thanks to this.
That's... a Stone of Gelel!
It's just like in the book.
What amazing power.
I can blow things away
without touching them.
Do you mean the Book of Gelel?!
Excuse me?
Where did you get that?!
Oh, it's not what you think...
I bought it from
a wandering salesman.
That's impossible!
I thought it was strange.
You destroyed Temujin's village
to get the Stone of Gelel...
Now why do you doubt me?
My goal is a world without wars.
How could you say
such a terrifying thing?
Those who truly want peace
wouldn't want the power of Gelel!
I want the power to stop all wars.
That is all.
Umm... The location of
the Mine is...
I can tell by looking at your eyes!
You're rotten at heart!
Hmm... I don't really know where it is...
Oh... What's this?
This is... the key to open
the door to the Mine.
Oh no! That's not for you!
Nerugui!
Oh... Nerugui!
Oh? There was a pebble of Gelel
in its mouth.
The poor thing.
Another noble sacrifice.
Honestly. Those who stand on top
have to make such tough decisions.
I've had enough of your empty words!
Oh, how troublesome.
There's going to be
another noble sacrifice...
I can't control my power very well yet...
Well, that's fine...
What are you doing, Temujin?
I'm very sorry, but...
The Mine of Gelel is already ours.
We can just ignore this helpless old man...
That is not what I'm asking.
Do not stand in front of my target.
Master Haido?
You're in the way there.
What are you bastards doing?!
Aren't you persistent...
Temujin!
Why are you just standing there?
Kill them!
What's this?
Is this... a noble sacrifice?
What's wrong?
Take care of them like you always do.
Now, quickly!
That's... enough, isn't it?
I...
Temujin, I'm disappointed in you.
You're also an inferior person,
like your parents.
- What a pitiful kid.
- What a pitiful kid.
That's impossible!
That's right, it's me!
I must say, you didn't even know
that I killed your parents...
and you became so attached to me.
What a cute pawn.
However... now that I know
where the stones are...
I no longer need you!
Master... Haido.
Die, you good for nothing!
Stop!
Temujin!
Now the world is mine!
Temujin!
Naruto!
Please, stop him...!
You piece of trash...
I won't let you go any further!
First trash, now rubbish...
Shadow Clone!
I....
We....
Why in the world....
have we....
- Multi...!
- Too slow!
Why don't you give up already?
No... way...
H-Hey you...
Are you... going to give up here?!
Wasn't your dream...
to make a utopia?!
Rasengan!
I did it...
Where does he... get that strength?
Well... that hurt a little bit.
What?!
This is...
wonderful!
It's the Mine of Gelel!
My wounds are healing!
What power!
Temujin! Lend me a hand!
I can't defeat him by myself!
You... still?
I won't give up. Now, help me!
What are you blabbing about?
Go to utopia already.
- Naruto!
- Temujin!
Everyone...
What...
have I done?
What foolish children.
I thought I ordered them
not to interfere.
Perhaps they're at a rebellious age.
Well, no matter.
This is beginning to bore me.
Temujin!
Damn it!
I...
I...!
Let's go, Temujin!
This is it. Go meet your ancestors!
Temujin...
Naruto... you were right.
Dreams that sacrifice friends
should never come to fruition!
Humph! Your deaths are long overdue.
How impudent!
You can't even touch me!
Die already!
Take this...!
This is for Temujin!
That won't work!
Oh no!
This is terrible?!
The Mine of Gelel,
the source of life!
Hey, Gramps!
What in the world is going on?!
The seal was broken when
the key to the Mine was destroyed!
What's happening?!
The Mine of Gelel is going wild...
How are they?
They're breathing...
But they're not regaining consciousness.
I see...
What's going on?!
Damn it! I hope nothing troublesome
is happening.
What happens when it goes wild?!
I don't know! But considering
the scale of the ancient empire...
it wouldn't be any wonder
if half this continent blew up!
What?!
How can we stop it?!
Unfortunately, there is no way.
What were you trying to do earlier?
You know some way.
What was that Jutsu formula?!
There isn't a way to stop it
from going out of control.
But there is a way
to destroy the Mine.
Tell me!
This is a special
Summoning Jutsu formula!
It is bound by royal blood.
Place your hand at the center!
What are you going to summon?
A Space-Time Rift.
A Space-Time Rift?
A vast empty space that
will swallow up everything.
It will appear at the center
of the Jutsu formula.
Therefore...
The person who activates
the Jutsu won't come back alive.
So that's it...
Gramps! What do you mean
"won't come back alive"?
Naruto!
This will be my way of
atoning for what I've done.
You!
Take care of everyone!
Temujin!
How many more of them are there?
Just a few more.
All right.
Crap! Come back safe, Naruto....
No way...
Come here....
That's enough...
Temujin, hold on tight!
What are you, stupid?! You'll die!
Shut up! Be quiet!
That's enough. Let go!
You're going to get pulled in!
It's not enough! It won't be
any good if you die like this!
I don't want to lose
any more friends!
Naruto? Where's Naruto?!
Is he still over there...?!
Oh! Wait, Sakura!
Crap!
Naruto!
Where are you?
Naruto!
What is this?!
What in the world's going on?!
Geez, it's even stronger
than the legend says.
Gramps!
Are you all right?!
I was tossed and crushed.
I was sure that my time had come...
Gramps, what's happened?
Life has budded in this wasteland.
This is what happened when just
a little of the Mine's power seeped out
as it was being destroyed.
Thanks to its power,
I'm totally healed!
Oh... Nerugui.
What is this?
Oh!
Temujin...
Where... is this place?
I'm alive?
I see... These ruins...
This is...
So it wasn't a picture of despair.
Temujin's part of your clan.
He should have stayed here.
He's headed to war...
It can't be helped.
It's the path he decided upon.
Our bond was cut
a long time ago.
It is very painful to try and feel the things,
Our bond was cut
a long time ago.
It is very painful to try and feel the things,
It is very painful to try and feel the things,
His soul is no longer tied
to this continent.
It is very painful to try and feel the things,
It is very painful to try and feel the things,
It'll be tough...
It is very painful to try and feel the things,
But he's not alone.
of which we used to not see, or know about.
But he's not alone.
of which we used to not see, or know about.

He said this time
of which we used to not see, or know about.
of which we used to not see, or know about.
he and his friends will really strive to
make a world without wars.
of which we used to not see, or know about.
It's not just you that wants
to start crying and run away.
It's not just you that wants
to start crying and run away.
Grandpa?
It's not just you that wants
to start crying and run away.
It's not just you that wants
to start crying and run away.
It's hopeless. I've been rejected.
It's not just you that wants
to start crying and run away.
It's the same for me too.
There are no such things as
meaningless efforts,
or unnecessary encounters.
So harden your fist
and Ding! Dong! Dang!
Come to think of it,
where's Naruto?
Even this flower that cannot be reached,
no matter how hard you reach for....
Come to think of it,
where's Naruto?
Even this flower that cannot be reached,
no matter how hard you reach for....
Even this flower that cannot be reached,
no matter how hard you reach for....
Well, I've looked for him,
but he isn't around.
Even this flower that cannot be reached,
no matter how hard you reach for....
We can easily grab it
if we join our hands together.
We grow far apart,
or misunderstand each other,
And even fight each other
to believe in something.
Even if the present hurts us
and drench ourselves in tears,
Let's go together towards our future.
Ding! Dong! Dang!
Even if we graduate,
or grow up as an adult,
You be yourself, and I'll be myself.
The sky above is never-ending.
There is not a single thing that covers it
There are no such things
as meaningless efforts,
or unnecessary encounters.
So harden your fist
and Ding! Dong!
You will give me the thing I lack in,
I will give you
the thing you don't have so,
Ding! Dong!
Dang!
