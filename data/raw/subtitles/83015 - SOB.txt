Excuse me, Mr. Farmer,
but John John wants his ball.
Excuse me, sir.
I made some coffee
and left a sweet roll in the oven.
I talked with Dr. Alfasa.
She doesn't think you should
see the children for a while...
...especially John John...
...until they get used to the idea.
Felix!
I'm leaving the Cadillac.
- I'm no dog!
- They're waiting in the car.
You snap your fingers, whistle.
- I'm no dog.
- I accept that.
How about moving your pigeon toes
towards the front door?
We'll get this show on the road.
Absolutely. I wouldn't have it
any other way.
Harry Sandler.
- Did you get Felix?
- No, I'm calling your father.
- Give him my love.
- What?
- Hello?
- Harry!
Yes, Dick.
I called Bel Air and Palm Springs
but didn't get an answer.
Right.
I tried his beach number
and I got some deranged Chinaman.
You get Felix on the phone and tell him
to be at David's office at 11:00.
Right.
You tell him 11:00, or it's his ass.
And your ass, too, Harry. Got it?
Joyce sends her best.
He wants to know how you are.
How do I look?
If I told him,
he'd have another heart attack.
She's terrific.
Now, stop jerkin' off and call your client.
The kids' bathing suits.
I left a set of keys on your dresser.
Mr. Farmer's residence. Harry Sandler.
I'm afraid Mr. Farmer is out to lunch.
I'm coming!
'Bye, Daddy!
Harry says it's a matter of life and death.
Please, be quiet.
Mommy, why can't Daddy come with us?
Because Mommy is having a very bad day.
A fire in downtown Los Angeles
this morning destroyed the Oak Hotel.
Luckily, no injuries.
The damage is estimated at $1.5 million.
Now, here's Tammy Taylor
with her exclusive report from Hollywood.
Night Wind opened in 800 theatres
to unanimously bad reviews...
... and in spite of a mammoth
advertising campaign...
... in the first week,
has grossed less money...
... than any film
in the history of Capitol Studios.
I have it on good authority
that Capitol's president, David Blackman...
... is considering
calling in all the prints.
- Can't someone find him?
- I've been on the phone all morning.
What about Sandler?
I told him it was his ass
if Felix wasn't here at 11:00.
- What did the lawyers say?
- lf you cut the film, he can sue.
Then, what's the answer?
Scare the hell out of him,
then give him your ideas.
- Ideas? It's a piece of shit.
- Absolutely.
That's one thing I'm proud of.
I'm a damn good cutter.
- You sure are.
- The best.
I ran the film twice last night.
The cutter agrees
with most of your suggestions.
- But will he say so to Felix?
- I think so.
- He's been with Felix for 15 years.
- He wants to direct.
- That's all I need. Another director.
- Speaking of directors...
What about Culley?
What about Culley, for Christ's sake?
He's shacked up with some 16-year-old girl
and a case of Jack Daniels.
He has a six-picture deal, pay or play.
What does he care?
I had a lengthy conversation
with him last night.
I told him that J.G. was so worried
he was considering selling the studio.
Knowing J.G., that's not so far-fetched.
Evidently, Culley didn't think so either.
- Obviously.
- What do you mean? Where is he?
Right outside.
All right, check on Sandler.
Send Culley in.
- Harry Sandler, this is Dick Benson.
- Gentlemen.
I want to recut Night Wind,
but Felix has an ironclad contract.
That's never stopped you before.
All right, no smart-ass stuff, Culley.
J.G. called six times last night.
If we don't do something quick,
all hell's going to break loose.
Harry!
It's 10:00 in the morning.
Where could he be having lunch?
I don't think you grasp
the seriousness of this situation.
- All right, hang up.
- He's not home, he's having lunch.
I want you to get Felix to agree
to recut the film.
Tell him you've got some good ideas.
Put out a story
that we're recalling all the prints...
...and Culley is going to make
some drastic changes to the picture.
- I've got to call in to J.G. at 6:00.
- Give him my regards.
Unless you have something that can't wait
till the 3:00 meeting, thank you.
- Hello.
- Did I wake you up?
Hi, darling.
No, you didn't wake me up.
Ready when you are.
It's a wonder.
You really wore me out last night.
You were fantastic.
You were pretty fantastic yourself.
Listen, I like your suggestion.
Sam Marshall and you
make good chemistry.
And he's right for the part.
- What did you say?
- Nothing.
That's great.
- Then we got a date?
- So, I'll see you tonight?
- I miss you.
- Yeah.
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye, darling.
You son of a bitch.
Well, he liked my suggestion.
He thinks you'll be great for the part.
Hi.
Ladies.
What a great car you have.
- Where are you headed?
- That depends.
Where are you headed?
You're late, Ben.
I know that, dear boy.
- What's up?
- They're all waiting in the study.
- You didn't answer my question, dear boy.
- That's because I'm not your dear boy.
Once we file for divorce,
it's a matter of public record.
Polly Reed's nose is in the wind.
- My secretary's saying I'm in Palm Springs.
- I have to say something.
You could not have picked a worse time.
As your press agent, I agree.
But it wouldn't be good
if Night Wind was a hit.
Like it or not, you're the first
to admit it. You have an image.
They have newspapers to sell.
Imagine what they'll say
once they've written the nice things.
You know this town, sweetie.
You can smoke dope and end up
going steady with your Afghan...
...and you're one of the gang.
But you, you're Peter Pan.
Night Wind is a fact.
We have to show it wasn't your fault.
Anybody can fail, even Sally Miles.
- No! That was Felix's responsibility.
- I didn't mean...
But, sweetie, you walk out on him now
and your friggin' fans will hate your guts.
- The ones who criticized your marriage.
- Those snakes will be the first.
Not even a legal separation?
- Absolutely not.
- Shit, no!
Are you out of your mind?
Damn.
Sorry.
That water is cold.
Take it easy, ladies,
while I check things out.
Gary?
Felix?
Sally?
Anybody home?
Good morning.
Culley, there was a man out there
with a rat, and he put it in our...
Good morning.
It's not such a good idea
to sit in here with the motor running.
I better turn off the ignition.
Oh, my God!
Sorry, Culley just called.
Felix tried to kill himself.
Just thought you'd like to know.
I can be reached at that number
or this one here.
Okay. I think that about covers it.
I appreciate you calling.
- Thank you very much.
- Nothing.
Can I borrow a bathing suit?
There must be some spares
in the upstairs dressing room.
If I can't find anything,
what are the laws on nude sunbathing?
- I'd have to come back and arrest you.
- Bet I could talk you out of it.
Bet she could, too.
I may drop back later
and check on Mr. Farmer. Let's go!
Do that. And, Phil, there's liable to be
some reporters nosing around.
The only person who likes reporters
less than me is the chief.
They stick their noses in the wrong place,
they get stepped on.
Tell Mr. Farmer if he ever does a movie
about the cops...
...l've got a lot of stories.
- I'll tell him.
- None of that Serpico crap, the real cops.
- See you later, Mr. Culley.
- Okay.
I don't believe it.
The traffic is jammed up
all the way to Topanga.
It took me an hour and a half to get here.
- How is he?
- Compared to what?
Come on. Gary called and said that Felix...
I told Gary to tell Sally
not to take an ad out in Variety.
- Lila, this is Ben.
- Nice to meet you.
Gary was just doing his job.
Maybe Felix did try to kill himself,
but Sally will suffer!
- I couldn't find a bathing suit.
- Babs, Ben.
Nice knowing you.
I'd like to nude sunbathe,
but I might get busted.
Darling, you already are busted.
- You think it's all right?
- I think it's a wonderful idea.
Great.
Here goes nothing.
If that's her idea of nothing,
can you imagine her concept of something?
Culley, you're a dirty old man.
- Hi, Doc. How is he?
- Hi, Ben.
How is he?
Why is it nobody ever asks
how the doctor is first?
Did it ever occur to you
that I could be sicker than the patient?
Irving, I'm sorry.
Felix will survive.
But for all you know, I might be terminal.
Thank God I'm not a surgeon.
- Can you wait till I mix you a drink?
- Barely.
Please! Felix is going to be all right,
isn't he?
He'll be fine.
- I'm not so sure about you.
- What's wrong?
You look like 180 pounds
of condemned veal.
- Let me give you a vitamin shot.
- No, thank you.
You never know. It might help.
Why should I give you a vitamin shot?
I'm the one with the hangover.
- Hi, hon, it's me. Any messages?
- B12.
- I don't want to talk to her.
- B complex.
- FYI only, I'm at Farmer's.
- Crude liver.
Okay. Hold on.
And a generous jolt of adrenal cortex...
...chased by a bloody mary.
I thought that was a chaser.
Where would Salk or Pasteur
be if they hadn't taken chances?
You must help me
with my story for the press.
Say you'll only be in the hospital
two months.
Fuck off, will you? Forgive me.
You want a drink?
In order to inject this properly,
I have to expose my gluteus maximus.
Want me to do it for you?
- Are you, perchance, a nurse?
- No. I used to be a junkie.
Would it endanger your amateur standing
if I ask you to use a sterilized needle?
You're the doctor.
That's the nicest thing
anyone has said to me all week.
Hello? Who is this?
Hello, Harry.
No, Culley. Yeah.
- No, it was just an accident.
- Jesus, it's all over town!
He put it in low instead of reverse...
...went through the garage wall
and into the ocean.
Tell the world.
Yeah, damn lucky.
It's just one of those ridiculous things.
Here he is now!
Felix! Thank God! We got our speech.
- Harry wants to know how you're feeling.
- I know you didn't try to take your life.
Did you hear that?
He said, "I never felt better in my life."
But you know how they can blow
a thing like this out of proportion.
Imagine what would happen
if Polly Reed got her hands on this.
We've got to sit down and
get our stories straight. Let me handle it.
Felix, are you listening to me?
I want to play it down.
It was a freak accident.
Domestic problems. No, wait.
Tell the studio the doctor wants him
to stay in bed for a day or two.
No, I said I should stay in bed
for a day or two.
He should go out, play golf,
get some exercise.
I know it's been a bad couple of days,
and I won't kid you, you look awful.
The sooner we settle this,
the sooner you'll get some rest.
No, Harry. I haven't said anything to him.
They just pulled him out of
the Pacific Ocean, for Christ's sake.
Either come out here
and take care of it yourself...
...or butt out and let me handle it.
- He won't even talk to me.
- I promise you.
You'll be the first one to know.
Now, take it easy. Goodbye.
That's a nervous Jew.
That's not a nervous Jew.
This is a nervous Jew.
- You don't look nervous.
- lf you don't stop it...
Don't get sore.
Some of my best friends are nervous.
You've got to talk to him.
Tell him, in 10 minutes that doorbell
will ring and all hell will break loose.
- See who it is, Lila.
- But don't let them in.
I'd like to see Felix.
- Felix who?
- Farmer.
This is the Farmer house, isn't it?
I'll have to ask. Wait a minute.
- It's a woman. Gave me the creeps.
- Describe her.
- Bleach blonde, a lot of makeup...
- It's Polly.
- She says she wants to see Felix.
- What are we going to do, Culley?
The back door.
I remember this scene in The Thing.
- There was this horrible monster on...
- Will you shut up?
Hi, Polly.
Amazing coincidence.
I was just talking about you.
Were you really, Irving?
Hello, Culley. Ben.
I hear that Felix tried to commit suicide.
You heard that Felix...
Felix tried to commit suicide.
Ridiculous.
He fell on her?
They've taken her
to the Santa Monica Hospital.
How could he fall on her?
He was trying to hang himself.
- How is he?
- He's okay.
Polly might have a fractured pelvis
and a broken leg.
Send flowers.
He fell on her.
Let's get something to eat.
Okay.
- What a cute dog.
- Yeah.
Okay, Felix.
Attaboy.
Felix.
For the last 40 years
I've lived a life of dedicated debauchery.
I've consumed enough booze
to destroy a dozen healthy livers.
I've filled my lungs with enough nicotine...
...to poison the entire population
of Orange County.
I've indulged in sexual excesses
that would make Caligula...
...look like a celibate monk.
I have, in fact, conscientiously,
day in and day out...
...for more years than you've been
in this best of all possible worlds...
...tried to kill myself,
and I've never felt better in my life.
If you're really going to end it all...
...I can show you
a half dozen great ways to do it.
- What did you give him?
- A pinch of this, a dash of that.
Sometimes referred to in the trade
as a Sleeping Beauty boilermaker.
Take no notice if he begins to levitate.
It's a common side effect.
Culley.
Yeah?
I'm starved. What do I do about dinner?
What do you normally do about dinner?
Eat.
- Why should tonight be any different?
- And we're out of vodka.
Jesus, Irving, I just opened a new fifth.
Then it's only fair that I open the next.
I'll get it.
Hello?
Yeah. Just a minute. It's for you.
This is Dr. Finegarten.
- Where's Culley?
- Upstairs.
God.
Okay, put her through.
- I just got back from the hospital.
- Watch the hole. How is Polly?
Broken arm, fractured pelvis...
...screaming her lungs out at everybody,
reporters all over the place.
Felix?
- What's the matter with him?
- Dr. Finegarten's magic needle.
I've seen week-old corpses
that look healthier.
But not happier.
Felix!
Believe me, Mrs. Zukerman,
there's nothing serious.
Come on, Lila. I'll take you to the market.
I'll get my roller skates.
Just keep taking the medicine.
Tomato juice.
- And lots of water.
- Doc.
Excellent. And no spicy foods.
No, that's spicy, Mrs. Zukerman.
In a couple of days,
if it isn't better you drop in the office.
Right.
Goodbye, Mrs. Zukerman.
- I have got to talk to Felix right now.
- Go ahead.
What? He doesn't even know
I'm in the same room.
If you want answers,
you better wait about nine hours.
Nine hours?
Farmer residence. Who's calling?
- It's David Blackman.
- Say hello.
This is Ben Coogan.
Maybe I can help, Mr. Blackman.
Join me in one of these little pink pills?
It's David Blackman.
Don't you understand?
Yes, sir, Mr. Blackman.
This is Ben Coogan. Yes, sir.
Listen, Ben. I need straight information.
We're getting all kinds of stories here.
Right now, he's heavily sedated, sir.
Dr. Irving Finegarten.
If he doesn't remember me,
mention his first clap.
- God, I'm going to kill you one day.
- I didn't give it to him. I cured him.
I'm afraid so, sir.
All right. Keep in touch.
A Hollywood gossip columnist
was seriously injured today...
... while visiting the Malibu home
of film producer Felix Farmer.
According to reporters, Mr. Farmer
fell from his second-story bedroom...
... and landed on Miss Reed who
was then rushed to the Malibu Hospital.
She's reported to be
in satisfactory condition.
Satisfactory, shit.
Farmer was involved in a bizarre accident.
Hi.
... crashed through his garage
and sank into the Malibu surf.
How do you feel?
How do I feel?
Jesus, in the 14 years we've been married
you've asked some stupid questions...
...but, "How do I feel?"
really takes the friggin' cake.
- It was just in a hospital-type question.
- Then you're a hospital-type moron.
How do I feel?
Look at me. I feel marvelous.
I thought, maybe after dinner
we'd go dancing.
Where is that friggin' nurse?
I dropped by the farmers' market
and got you some fudge.
I'm surprised it wasn't a trampoline.
I'm in a lot of pain
and I want another shot.
I'm sorry, Miss Reed, but I can't
give you another shot until 9:00.
That's two hours!
- I'm sorry, but the doctor...
- I'm in agony and you're sorry.
- Honey...
- Shut up, Willard. You listen to me.
Phone the doctor now
and tell him I need something...
...for my pain, right now,
because I'm in agony.
You better call him.
- Who are you?
- That is the Marquis de Sade.
He has nothing to say about it.
You damn well better listen
to what I'm telling you.
- I'll see what I can do.
- You'll do more than just see, missy.
You do, see?
Willard...
...I feel just terrible.
I just hate being in this awful hospital.
- It'll be all right, sweetheart.
- No, it won't.
- Sure it will.
- No, it won't.
You're not making matters any better...
...just hanging around here
making me nervous.
I foolishly thought that
I might be able to help.
You want to help?
Run down to Malibu. Drop in on Felix.
See what the hell is going on.
- What, you mean now?
- No. Next month. Of course, now.
My God.
A simple little favor, you'd think
I was asking for the friggin' moon.
Do you want me to telephone you
or drop back by?
Whatever.
Ciao.
Ciao.
- Do I get my shot?
- Yes.
Then, thank heaven.
Hurry up, for Christ's sake.
Come on, Jesus.
Culley?
I just saw Sam Marshall.
- How is he?
- Do you know him?
Oh, my God, here he comes.
Hey, Culley.
Sam, how are you?
- Are you living on the beach now?
- No, just visiting.
Why don't you drop by the house?
I'm having a little birthday party.
Congratulations.
Thank you, but it's not mine.
Whose is it?
I don't know.
It has to be somebody's, right?
So, you're invited.
I'd like to, but... Hey, I've got an idea.
- You know Felix Farmer, don't you?
- We're practically neighbors.
He's kind of down in the dumps.
He needs cheering up.
If Mohammed can't go to the party,
then the party will go to Mohammed.
You never know, it might be his birthday.
Are you having problems, darlin'?
- Lila, Sam. Sam, Lila.
- Hello, Lila.
- Culley!
- It's nothing. She's just a big fan.
Help me get her up.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Come on.
Okay. See you on the beach.
Sure.
Are you feeling better?
- So, what do you do?
- I breed armadillos.
- Do you enjoy your work?
- Not especially.
But the armadillos sure
get a kick out of it.
Is it profitable?
Only in the spiritual sense.
A wise man once said:
"Make an armadillo smile
and the world is your oyster."
At one time,
I considered breeding oysters...
...but it just didn't sound right.
- "Make an oyster smile..."
- "And the world is your armadillo."
You can see the problem.
Take this for me, will you, please?
- Why haven't you called?
- I've been trying to phone.
Your line was busy.
I even called the operator.
I want to talk to Felix right now.
Upstairs. First bedroom on the left.
Want a drink?
Hi, baby.
Not until I talk to Felix.
- Culley, what's he want here?
- He just wants to talk to Felix.
- We can't let him talk to Felix.
- Ben, go have a Scotch and Maalox.
Christ, all we need now
is for Willard to show up.
- Hello, Willard.
- Hello, Culley. Hi, Ben.
Sam is having a party and we can use
someone of your gender and wit.
- How is Felix?
- Recovering, fortunately.
- How's Polly?
- Recovering, unfortunately.
Dive in, will you?
Culley. It's for you.
- Hi, Mr. Culley.
- Gentlemen, come in.
Just got off duty. Thought we'd stop by.
Good. Nothing like a uniform
to keep an orgy organized.
- You're kidding.
- Bribe you, maybe, but kid you, never.
Your attention, everyone.
What?
Officers Buchwald and Sutherland.
- Is this a bust?
- Of course.
You've got six hours to talk them out of it.
Did you find out anything
about Sam Marshall?
He's asking $1 million
against 10 percent of the gross.
That's double what he got
on his last picture.
- His last picture was a big hit.
- It wasn't that big.
I don't even want to talk about it.
Okay.
This picture is important to me.
You can't expect me...
David, if you don't want
to talk about it, let's don't.
Telephone, Mr. Blackman.
Thank you, Tom.
- Yeah?
- He's upstairs, under heavy sedation.
That's right.
I'm going to stick around
for a while in case he comes out.
What?
Sam Marshall is having a birthday party.
Work on Marshall.
I want him for Killing Ground.
But not at $1 million against 10%.
What is the limit?
All right. Great.
I'll see what I can do. Okay?
Hello?
It's for you, Sam.
Yeah?
He gave Benson orders to work on you.
He absolutely won't go for $1 million...
...but he will settle for $750,000.
Let me give you a call in the morning.
Yeah, I miss you, too.
Goodbye.
Hello there.
I've got it.
Sex, Tony. That's the answer.
We'll give them
a $40 million pornographic...
...epic.
He's gone berserk.
He says he knows how to make
Night Wind...
...the biggest grosser
in the history of entertainment.
And he wants to meet you
at the studio right now.
The Polly Wolly Doodle set.
You cannot go to the studio at this hour.
What would David Blackman say?
- What the hell did you do?
- Listen, he's on his way now.
Why are you kissing me?
Maybe he's got something.
It could be your one chance
to recoup all the...
- My God!
- Willard.
- What happened?
- I am so sorry.
What the hell's going on there?
He's on his way. I've got to go.
What do you mean?
Goddamn it, I'm talking to you.
Why are you going? Don't go.
Don't go. Why are you going?
Don't pull on the leg.
Don't pull on my leg.
What the hell is he barking at?
Get the goddamn dog out of here.
Take it easy, Benny. The party is over.
"Lullaby and good night"
See you in a couple of days.
Get that dog out of here.
- Did you see him?
- No, I haven't seen him.
What's this all about?
What happened to you?
God, if I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
Felix?
- Where is he?
- I don't know. He said he'd be here.
Felix!
What the hell...
She remembers the song.
What does it mean?
A childhood trauma
buried deep in her unconscious.
Her dying father. Her lying mother.
The final piece of the jigsaw.
She's emancipated.
But we blew it. We didn't grab 'em. Why?
Do you know why?
I'll tell you why.
Because dying fathers and lying mothers...
...are a dime a dozen, these days.
Home and family have become
civilization's antiques...
...along with the flag...
... Sunday school, Girl Scout cookies...
... C.B. de Mille and virginity.
We gave them virtue, they want vice.
We sold them schmaltz,
they prefer sadomasochism.
Instead of the American dream...
... it should have been
the American wet dream.
We'll reshoot.
We'll make Gillian West, businesswoman,
into a nymphomaniac executive.
Packard de Haven, rugged male chauvinist
is really a transvestite.
Felix.
The dream sequence will become
erotic orgies.
- Felix.
- It is perfect.
It is a 20th century Sodom and Gomorrah...
... and in the end,
God turns Gillian into saltpeter.
- Felix, for God's sake.
- Think of it, David.
Like the phoenix rising from the ashes,
Night Wind will become...
... the greatest money-making film
in motion picture history.
Today, a $30-million flop.
Tomorrow, a $40-million
box office champion.
- $40 million?
- A month to re-write.
- Another $10 million.
- Maybe $11, no more.
You expect me to put up $11 million...
...for what is the worst
crap I have ever seen?
- Crap?
- No.
I'll tell you what you're going to do,
what you can do:
You're going to re-cut Night Wind
exactly the way I tell you to cut it.
Never.
Then, by God,
if it's the last thing I do, I'll fix it...
...so you never do another picture
in this town as long as you live.
Oh, my God. Throw him off the lot.
I'll have you arrested, maniac.
Go on, have me arrested.
I still own 150,000 shares of Capitol Films.
Next month at the annual meeting...
... we'll let the stockholders decide
who is the maniac.
You think, when the stockholders hear you
cost the company $30 million plus prints...
Me, personally?
It's your film. A Felix Farmer production.
And who okayed the script and budget?
Who's responsible
for going $12 million over budget?
I went up to your office,
put a gun to your head, and said:
"Give me $12 million
or I'll blow your brains out?"
You think I wanted to spend
the extra $12 million?
In a way, you did do that.
It's your fault we fell behind schedule.
Then why didn't you fire me?
He didn't fire you because
he's a decent human being, that's why.
Fire me, he's got no fall guy.
Felix, you're finished. You're through.
Contract or no contract...
...I am going to cut your picture
and you can go ahead and sue.
Go ahead.
Cutting won't help.
If you won't let me
reshoot it, sell it to me.
What did you say?
I'll buy Night Wind.
How much do you want?
Don't listen to him, David. He's crazy.
Yeah, but he's got the first nickel
he ever made.
- Are you serious?
- Name your price.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
I'm telling you, he's nuts.
He's not responsible for what he's saying.
Then we have to make sure
we cash the check before they lock him up.
We've got $30 million, plus prints,
advertising and interest.
- I can raise $20 million.
- Forget it.
You can tear up my contract.
Three pictures, pay or play,
plus a gross percentage.
$20 million...
...your contact and your Capitol stock.
No, I'll only buy if I can reshoot.
My stock will just about cover that.
Goodnight, Felix.
And don't forget to turn off the lights.
$18 million, contract...
...and stock.
$16 million.
Get the lawyers.
A major studio executive
told me this morning...
... that Felix Farmer
paid Capitol Studios...
... $35 million for all
rights to Night Wind...
... starring his wife Sally.
"Smiles, " to her close friends,
isn't smiling this morning...
... probably because under
the California community property law...
... half of that $35 million is hers.
If Felix doesn't make Night Wind
a box office hit...
... poor Sally might never smile again.
This is Tammy Taylor...
"This is Tammy Taylor from Hollywood."
Open your mouth, Willard,
and I'll smear Krazy Glue on your bedpan.
- Hi.
- Hey, what's happening?
Sell it. Then get on the phone
to Geneva and dump the gold.
No, I have to have another $5 million.
Bill, no there's no time to discuss,
I have to be shooting by September 1.
We're in business. Writers.
- Who wrote Last Tango?
- Beats me.
There. My God, Culley,
neither of us knows who wrote Last Tango.
I hated it.
I never remember the names of people
that perpetrate something I hate.
But that's the trouble.
Don't you see? I hated it, too.
- In my opinion, a discretionary judgment.
- But we're wrong, Culley.
That's what they want.
That's where it's at.
It's been my experience that every time
I think I know where it's at...
...it's usually somewhere else.
You know as well as I do,
if we're going to stay in business...
...if we're to remain filmmakers
in any sense of the word...
...we must shake off
the rusty shackles of the past...
...observe the present for what it is
and the future for what it will become.
Like it or not.
Then we must make our creative comment.
Felix, as far as you know,
have I ever lied to you?
Never.
I have, once or twice.
About nothing that was too important.
But now, the fact that I have admitted
that on occasion I have lied to you...
...should convince you that
I'm a fairly honest man.
And when it comes to the crunch...
...that I can handle myself
with an acceptable degree of integrity.
- Now, do you agree?
- Wholeheartedly.
I'm going to give it to you straight,
old friend.
You think I'm crazy.
That's a little straighter than I intended.
Maybe, Culley.
I tried to kill myself four times,
hardly rational.
$16 million plus for a flop.
Every cent I have in the world.
Not what most people
would consider a very sane act.
But insane?
What if I'm right?
If my vision is valid, Culley.
Not so crazy. A more acceptable insanity.
Culley, that's all beside the point.
Sane and miserable, or insane and bursting
with creative joy and happiness.
That's the point, Culley.
In the end, who says he's sane,
therefore he should?
Or he's insane, therefore he shouldn't?
Culley, come on. Even if I'm wrong...
...and I'm not...
...I am full of fire, Culley.
I'm a blazing comet.
Comets burn out.
But, my foes and my friends,
it gives a lovely light.
Felix!
I must warn you,
my hands are lethal weapons.
So is your goddamn fountain pen.
I'd better be going.
You stay where you are, Culley.
You're a witness. You lunatic.
You maniac.
$16 million?
Half of that money is mine.
That entitles you to 50 percent
of the profits.
That entitles me to have you arrested
for grand theft, larceny...
...fraud, embezzlement...
You thieving, filching son of a bitch.
Sally Miles swears.
You're going to give me my $8 million,
or so help me...
...l'll have you locked up for
the rest of your unnatural life.
Give me my money, Felix.
Give it to me or I will kill you.
Sally Miles kills.
Shit.
Sally Miles says "shit."
Sell $100 million at the box office.
$200 million. Peter Pan is dead.
Long live Gillian West,
nymphomaniac executive.
Not since Edison, not since Griffith,
not since Jolson.
We'll make motion picture history.
A cinematic monument
to man's immorality.
A celluloid prophesy
of the holocaust to come.
"For if God spared not
the angels that sinned...
"...but cast them down to hell...
"...and delivered them
into chains of darkness...
"...to be reserved unto judgment:
"And spared not the old world...
"...but saved Noah...
"...the eighth person,
a preacher of righteousness...
"...bringing in the flood upon the world
of the ungodly."
God.
I broke you and I can make you.
It's rotten, but it's a revelation.
We failed, that we may succeed.
- We keep the basic set, Rich.
- Right.
It's still a dream, but now,
a Freudian nightmare of erotic symbolism.
Seduced in a nursery, but not voluntarily.
Not the victim of her own lust,
as she always feared...
...but the victim of a powerful aphrodisiac
slipped in her Bosco.
New lyrics, Bob. Prurient but profound.
- Felix, it's not that easy.
- Gino, new choreography.
The animals are out. I don't think
bestiality makes it, musically.
But Felix, it's such a different concept.
A different concept
for a different world, Gino.
Costumes, Agnes. Come on.
- Agnes, what about the costumes?
- It depends.
- How erotic do you really want to go?
- Go.
E-R-O-T-l-C. Go!
Sally Miles, America's G-rated darling
in the B-U-F-F?
Why not?
Darling, some of her fans
still don't think she goes to the bathroom.
If you want to dramatize the evils of
prostitution, corrupt a virgin, not a whore.
Wait. Just let me readjust my sights.
Fifteen years of nun's habits and
turtleneck bathing suits and now...
Agnes, remember your first
Academy Award, Garbo Talks?
Yes, she talked,
but she went to the bathroom, too.
You can do it, Agnes. I know you can.
Agnes.
Okay.
I can do it.
That's my girl.
