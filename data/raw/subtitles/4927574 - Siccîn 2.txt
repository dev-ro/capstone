Do you think that I will forget
if you remove the stain?
What do you mean?
Do you think that I will forget
if you remove the stain?
Please. Do not lean on me.
Lean on what? Whom?
Wish had I known, I'ld have
never left him alone.
You ...
.. killed my child.
Please.
You killed me.
You killed me.
Shame on you! Callous mother.
May God damn me.
May God damn me.
Shame on me!
Wish I had died instead of my son.
May God damn me.
May God damn me.
My son.
Why had I put you here?
I shouldn't have left you alone.
My son. I shouldn't have done.
Birol.
- Room 237.
- Thanks, man.
Say hello to dad, son.
Shall dad come to you?
Wave your hand to dad.
Birol. Where is your dad, son?
- Come daddy.
- Say come here.
Come daddy.
I've been missing you much.
- Say daddy.
- Daddy.
My son. I've been missing you much.
How are you, honey?
While I was walking to home, I've met
by chance to elder my brother.
As we named our boy as Birol,
his name. He is so pleased ...
... and gave me a hug. He
missed me too much.
I've invited him to visit us.
He's coming tommorrow.
He has greetings for you.
How about Birol?
Is he in the bedroom?
Shall you open the door?
Will you open the door?
Why are you so late?
My goodness!
Hicran, Are you sure that
you're not dreaming?
Not, Aynur. I wish, it had been a dream.
Then, when did your husband's brother die?
Died in an accident, when
Adnan was in primary school.
It's been 15 years ago, at least.
Was his brother's name Birol?
That's why we named our son as Birol.
You know what ... I had
warts on fingers. Remember?
No matter what medicine I have
applied, nothing worked.
One day my mother-in-law
took me a divine old man.
Don't sulk at me.
Shall we go him to talk?
You've got nothing to lose.
What are you talking about, Aynur?
Huh? Do you realise how I feel?
I go to bed with no blanket. Because my
child feels cold in grave, alone. Got it?
I've been washing his cloths and
nappies. Do you get it?
Don't blather me anymore for God's sake.
Village of Nevruz
My God, save me.
Give my baby to me.
It's my baby!
What's happened?
It's cold outside. Let me put some
chopped woods into the stove.
Mother.
You're almost done knitting.
Almost to be finished!
I've been your son's wife for 35 years,
You have done anything like that for me.
I see that you care for Hicran most, huh?
That takes the cake!
Shall you have a cup of tea?
Adnan. Please, talk to me anymore.
My son.
My beloved.
I've come to visit you.
My love.
I've come to you.
Your mother is here, son.
Is it cold there, honey?
You're getting cold there alone.
You forgive me.
Forgive your mother.
Birol.
Where?
Where are they?
My son.
My son.
My son.
Birol.
Birol.
Hicran.
I've mentioned it on the phone
to Abdullah, cleric man.
Don't worry. Everything will be alright.
- Alright?
- Alright.
Welcome.
- Daughter. You stay here.
- Alright, sir.
Write your name here 3 times, daughter.
Reach forth your hand.
In the name of God...
When have your tribulations
started, daughter?
Since previous week, sir.
Aynur, your friend mentioned
me your delusions.
When it's started, it keeps going.
It frequently happens.
Actually, I had some, when I was a child.
I barely remember. But ...
Those were not like these.
Freshen your heart, daughter.
God has always been with good ones,
we would overcome those.
Listen to me, daughter.
Sumeyye was first female
martyr of our holy religion.
Chief of unbelievers imprisoned her
in a dungeon, tortured her cruelly.
He wanted her to deny and
refuse the God almighty.
He dared to ...
... even slander her that she's in love
Mohammed, so she's one of his follower.
She refused him clearly although she
had been so exhausted to talk.
And she spent her last
strength to spit his face.
Then, chief of unbelievers killed
her by his spear.
Then,
Tell me...
If evil hadn't been in exist, how can
we realize the grace of good?
God almighty created evil, so that we
would understand virtue of goodness.
That's God's trial for mankind.
Let God almighty keep us in confidence
up to his holy presence.
Amen.
My condolences, daughter.
Thanks.
Your son lives in heaven,
with angels any longer.
May he rest in peace by God's will.
Do you get along with aunts?
I had a sister of my mother.
She had died long time ago.
I have sister of father, too.
We dropped her, don't visit her.
Why?
She had a problem to share an
inherited plot with mother.
So, they've been offended
each other for long years.
Is your father alive?
He had died, when I was a kid.
Commited suicide.
I don't remember his face.
Hicran, daughter.
I will tell you all.
But, do not scare.
Solution of all troubles are ...
... at the who created the universe.
We need to seek refugee only him.
You've been under effect of a black magic.
It's named as spell of 41 stitches.
It's hard to both cast and break it.
It's not easy to cast it for ordinary man.
Who casted the spell, both must have
been so familiar to black magic ...
... and also must have been pure evil,
so relentless as heart of stone.
It's a type of very strong black magic.
To cast this spell, they would do
it with collaboration of the wicked ...
... devils which deserve
burn in the depths of hell.
Sir,
Who should do black magic against me?
Somebody, 2nd degree relative of yours.
It's your sister of your mother or father.
That's why I have asked them.
Spell of 41 stitches is done
for 41 different intentions.
God knows only, for which intentions
they have casted for you.
I will help you with help
of grace of the God.
First, we need to find out
who casted the black magic.
If we don't know the
intention of sorcery, ...
... we would not able to break it.
Even,
We would may be incapable
against to who did it.
As long as God almighty,
who created all, ...
... gives us his blessing and strength, ...
... we would not to be defeated by evil.
We recline upon Lord only.
We can find salvation in him only,
against the evil of satan.
God bless you.
Hicran, my daughter.
Relocate holy book to your home again.
Mother!
I will sew her tongue.
Heaven's sake! Who could
it be in so late hours?
Hicran?
- My daughter. How are you?
- So and so.
Come in, my love.
Mother. Why the keys are over there?
You didn't lock the door.
Daughter. Everybody knows
each other. No need to lock.
Where is my grand mother?
In the room.
She's some praying.
May God accept your prayers, grandmother.
I have missed you too much.
Sit down here. Come on.
My lovely daughter.
I have missed you all so much.
Are you alright?
Yes, we're alright.
Thanks to God.
We are just living, as we get old.
I have dreamed a nightmare about you. So I
wanted to check if you're safe and sound.
For heaven's sake. What did you dream?
Never mind. It's over. I feel better now.
I wish, you had served to grandma first.
Have your meal.
I'll bring to her.
Mother.
Yes, daughter.
Do you have any news from my aunt?
Nothing, daughter.
They used to visit on summer vacations.
Why did you ask it?
Just casually. I was just chattering
with Aynur, friend of mine.
As mentioned, I have
wondered her.
I've heard that diagnosed as
she got breast cancer.
It's justice of God.
Mother.
We have also chattered about
aunt Zehra with Aynur.
Have you still been reciting
Koran often for her soul?
Always, daughter.
More frequently.
You used to mention about her very few.
If hurts you, no need to tell.
Why did her husband do such a thing?
I'm so sorry, mum.
Her husband, the devil, ...
... lost his family's assets on gambling.
Then, he, the dirty toper dog,
couldn't have taken care his family.
One night, ...
... he killed her wife Zehra
and two daughters.
If he couldn't had have
taken care family ...
I would have taken care my sister and kids.
How old were the girls?
One of them ...
... just turned to 8 years.
Other was too young.
I'm so sorry that I made you cry ...
 ... by reminding bad memories.
I've been crying for 25 years, daughter.
Please, don't cry anymore.
Don't let my grandma see you crying.
Come on.
Let me call husband
to say that I'm here..
To make you worry is the
last thing I may wish.
But, I'm so overstressed grandma.
I'm just opening myself to you,
About to lose my mind so that ...
 ... how I had neglected my son there.
His image never disappears
in front of my eyes.
I lost my vitality to survive.
I have never been so unrestful before.
Why God let us to live this grief?
You've your lost your kid, too, grandma.
Why did God take away
my only child from me?
Why?
What would you talk to me ...
... if you had been able to speak?
If I should mute like you, would
the grieves decrease, grandma?
I've been missing him too much.
I've been missing him too much.
Welcome lady.
Where is my husband, Adnan?
He's gone to bank,
will be back soon.
What's up? Any problem?
I'll go to dentist. I want to
leave my son to his father.
I asked if he could take care our
son. When shall he return?
He'ld be back for a few minutes.
Leave him with me.
Alright.
Shall we do a suprise for dad?
You've grown too much.
Thank you.
Take care yourself.
May I call you as Birol once?
Huh?
Only once?
Birol.
Sonny.
My beloved son.
My son.
Would you call me as dad for once?
Huh?
Come on.
Call me dad once.
Call me dad once.
Call me dad once. Come on.
Call me dad once. Come on.
Call me dad.
Come to me, son.
Don't cry, my son.
Good day, uncle.
Good day.
I didn't recognize you.
I'm Hicran. Daughter of Necmiye.
Have a seat. Would you drink a cup of tea?
Thank you. I want to talk
to you for a short time.
Wife! We have a guest.
Shall you bring a cup of tea?
Do you have any purpose to visit?
Uncle, You've been reeve
of village for long years.
You must have known my aunt and her
family. I wanted to ask their condition.
I asked to mother also. But she
replied me that they don't talk...
...  each other for long time.
Do they visit here?
They moved from here for a long time.
No their living relatives here,
... only your grandmother. But,
they don't talk to her.
They didn't visit here. Therefore, I
haven't seen her for 15 or 20 years.
Birol.

Don't scare, sister. It doesn't bite.
Whom did you come, sister?
Hi. I don't know exactly?
My aunt...
Excuse me. I didn't get it.
Do you know woman named as Zehra?
She lived here up to notorious incident.
What kind of incidents had happened?
Her husband had gone mad.
He had killed my aunt and two daughters.
Don't go that home.
Which home?
To haunted home.
Whose home is it?
There lives djinns.
Djinns made that man do the killings.
Then they have settled to home.
No one dared to enter there.
Where's that home?
Watch my words, sister.
There's not safe to go.
Just tell me its location.
- Do you see the minaret over there?
- Yes?
It's next house to mosque.
Allright. Thank you.
Village of Namazgah.
Mummy.
My son?
Mummy.
What are we going to play?
We're going to play 
blind man's buff.
Where have you been, honey?
We've waited to here you all day long.
I'd been pottering at, mother.
I have head ache. Would you
mind if I sleep some?
So, you do. Go to bed. Shall
bring you some pain killer?
No. I'ld be better, if I rest some.
- Is my grandmother in the room?
- She must be having a nap.
She's alright. Take care yourself.
- Daughter. I have brought pillow for you.
- Come in, mother.
Mother.
Do you have any photo of my aunt Zehra?
I'm not sure. Probably not.
I thought I saw her photo.
I barely remember.
If you bring the picture album,
I may find out her photo.
Here we have all. I remember that
we don't have her picture.
I might have mistaken.
My beloved daughter. You were
dreaming nightmare.
Calm down. Have a peaceful sleep.
Have a nice dreams.
Mother. Time for morning prayer.
Sister.
I would have had a boy.
Where's my boy right now?
Where? What happened to my baby?
Mother.
Why?
It's mine.
Stolen from me.
Give back. It's my baby.
Mine only.
I'll get back!
Mother? What's happened?
Grandmother?
Are you alright?
What's happened?
No... No problem, daughter.
It's alright.
Grandmother.
I'm going back to home.
Take care yourself.
Don't get on. Keep sitting.
Alright.
Don't push yourself.
Take it easy.
Daughter. Stay us more.
No need to leave us early.
My husband doesn't answer
phone. So, my minds blank.
I'll come to visit you again.
Hello, Cemal.
Hello, Hicran. Where' s
your husband been?
That's why I came here.
He didn't reply the phone.
Now, his phone is unreachable.
My gosh? He's been in a deep
melancholy nowadays.
Then, let me check home.
- OK.
- Keep me posted.
Sure.
Birol?
My son?
My son?
Hicran.
I would have had a boy child, too.
But, I hadn't have.
I've been expecting for 25 years.
Satanic verses written
on it for black magic.
This doll has been sewn
by 41 stitches.
Among 41 intentions, they ...
... have craved most evil and grimmiest.
To destroy a family ...
They have worshipped to
satan, for collaboration.
It's so evil, never go numb ...
... affects generation
to generation.
My son.
Done by your sister of mother.
She did it to exterminate
your mother's family.
Have you mentioned to your mother?
I couldn't have.
Both my mother and grandmother
are elder people.
I couldn't have told it.
You have to tell them, daughter.
Those wicked evils are so
patient, they always keep ...
... lurking in ambush.
Until the moment that you will hurt most.
Sir ...
It's been long years, since
my aunt passed away.
How can we learn that why and whom
she got to cast the spell?
My mother had much mourned about her death,
even more than mourning for my father.
How can I tell such a thing to her?
Then, bring her to me.
Let me talk to her under
grace of God almighty.
I want to ask her what she knows.
As long as we don't break the spell,
you would never be in peace.
No peace for you.
That's because you felt sorry, mother.
What else could we do instead of worry?
Have you realized that how
much she seems sallow?
How could she feel herself good?
Do you know that every night ...
Mother!
Mother!
Grandmother?
Grandmother. Where's my mother?
My daughter Necmiye always
hated her sister Zehra.
Grandmother? You can speak?
She envied Zehra's two daughters most.
Zehra gave birth both near
to harvest of roses.
So, they named daughters as Gülbahar
(Springrose) and Gülizar (Rose cheek).
My daughter. Have your meal.
Feed yourself good.
My beloved daughter.
You don't have to bother
yourself anymore. Gülizar's ...
... old enough to take
care of her little sister.
Gülizar. Do you want to have a brother?
Would you take care of him?
I'ld take care of him, too.
No. I would do it.
You are too small to care!
Have your meal alone.
I wish we would have a boy
to take care our daughters.
It would be perfect.
Her husband always talked about have a boy.
Necmiye exploited it for her benefits.
She had tricked her sister by saying ...
... her mother-in-law (me) could do
something for have a baby as boy.
Hold it, daughter Necmiye.
Necmiye cried and appealed me so much.
I got persuaded by her insists.
We had invited Zehra and husband. They
came by theirselves to their own deaths.
They were so naive, thought that
I beseeched God for them to have a boy.
But I had done the worst black magic
that I know, spell of 41 stitches.
I intented to exterminate her family bliss.
Zehra, take this doll.
Keep it under your pillow.
God bless you.
They thought it was for
boy, even thanked me.
 But, doll was figure of her husband.
Then, husband's mind was captured
by evils, he went mad.
Then, they have turned him evil.
Dad, what are we going to play?
We're going to play
blind man's buff, daughter.
Just blind man's buff.
Daddy. Are you going to hide?
I invoked evil djinns against the family
for possession to kill all.
I did it by sewing doll by 41 stitches.
I got them possesed all.
Angels had saved Zehra, because
of she was praying, while husband ...
... approached to kill her.
But, he couldn't.
In the name of God.
Husband!
How could you have done it?
Why did you have a grudge
against those innocents?
What kind of hatred is it, grandmother?
Where's my mother, grandmother?
Grandmother, where's my mother?
We took Zehra, brought her to home.
As she entered home, she had labor pains.
We lost our bearings.
Up to few hours, parturition started.
Be strong. Come on.
Push!
Push more!
Hush.
Go!
We couldn't have stopped the bleeding.
Everywhere covered with her blood.
As a premature birth, she
afforded too much pain.
She gave a birth to you, as 7 months.
Me?
What are you talking about, grandmother?
You're Zehra's daughter.
Necmiye had been infertile. She
was unable to get pregnant.
We have snatched you and ...
... adopted as our daughter.
What are you talking about, grandmother?
Who's my mother?
Is woman whom I know as aunt
since my childhood, my real mother?
Grandmother.
Had my mother died, during
having gave a birth to me?
Your mother hadn't died during parturition.
Hush...
You... You killed my mother, ...
... my father ...
... and my sisters.
My God keep me sane.
God I rely upon you!
My mother's killer raised me.
Did I think that murderer
of mother is my mother?
I shown respect to you, murderer of family
as if you were my grandmother?
Look at my face!
Look at my face, you hag!
Look into my eyes!
I told you, look into my eyes, murderer!
God will charge you to punish.
Me, too.
You will pay for your sins, you hag.
Do you hear?
Do you hear me?
Where's she?
Where?
Where's Necmiye?
Where's dirty murderer?
Where have you been, murderer?
Where have you been?
You, murderer!
My goodness! God don't let me go insane!
My God keep my sanity safe.
My son hated me, too.
He told me that one who has a child,
too, shouldn't have done it.
Wake up, hag! What kind of dirty
human you have been!
What kind of dirty mother you are!
Then, God has let my only child, my son
to commit a suicide to excruciate me.
My son.
I repent for my sins faithfully.
Forgive me.
Forgive me, son.
Forgive me, son.
Forgive.
Forgive.
Adnan?
Forgive.
Forgive me, Adnan.
Hicran claimed to Abdullah, the cleric
old guy that her dead husband and ...
... her dead son stayed with
her for two months at home.
As Abdullah broke the spell of 41 stiches,
fifteen months later Hicran ...
... remarried to someone else. Now,
she lives in Biga, Çanakkale province.
Thousands are inolving the black magic
or suffering because of black magic.
Whereas to involve with sorcery is
one of the biggest sin that mankind ...
... could commit according to Islam.
