The Three Great Super Saiyans
Miss ''World's Most Beautiful
Girl'' World Competition
Hey Oolong aren't they\ngoing to start this soon?
You're a fine one to talk.
They said it's going to be\nheld at 7:00 in the evening.
It was a certain dirty old man that\nwanted to line up for it now I believe.
It's the ones who\nsit in the very front
that get to see the {\i1}Pichi-pichi{\i0}\ngals the best you know!
After all this is the Miss ''World's
Most Beautiful Girl'' World Competition!
Just imagining it makes\nmy blood pressure rise!
To be able to get young {\i1}Pichi-pichi{\i0}\ngals to play {\i1}pafu-pafu-{\i0} with me\nafter going so long without...!
{\i1}Pichi-pichi{\i0} gals huh?
You guys! Both of you cut it\nout with your indecent thoughts!
We're in front of
Trunks here aren't we?
Um Kuririn-{\i1}san{\i0}
I don't particularly...
You guys are going to corrupt\nthis young man's purity of heart!
Ha! You're a fine one to say so!
Kuririn! What was all that earlier?
There's no use for us to line up here!
Let's go peek into the\nchanging rooms! Quickly let's go!
We might be able to peek in at a\ngirl changing into her swimsuit!
Ah I wonder are there going to be are\nany cute girls that would be my bride!?
O- oh no that was a just a gag!
That was obviously\njust a gag wasn't it?
I aim to be a martial artist that can\nalso let fly with the gags you know!
Well Oolong let's go peek into\nthe dressing rooms just you and I!
Sure thing! Kuririn\nkeep our places for us!
Come on now!
I'm going to tell the police!
Trunks... sorry man!
Hold our places okay?
Kuririn-{\i1}san{\i0}!
What am I going to do with them?
I wish Goku-{\i1}san{\i0} and the others\nwould finish shopping already.
I had that one first!
Gohan why do women love\nshopping as much as this?
In Mother's case it looks like she\nuses shopping to relieve stress.
Maybe that's it...
Goku-{\i1}sa{\i0} take these too!
Are you finished now Chichi?
Next up are clothes for you Goku-{\i1}sa{\i0}!
You wear the same thing all year round!
You're goin' to dress\nup once in a while!
...I'm just a bit\nrun-down that's all--!
Son Goku...
Kuririn and the others sure goofed up!
To think they were off by a whole day!
I thought it was kind\nof strange you know?
I mean nobody was\nlining up except for us.
Well we'll just have to\nlook forward to tomorrow.
Welcome--
--What's wrong?
--What's the matter?
Gohan you've got to eat more!
You'll never grow up otherwise!
I just can't keep up\nwith Father's appetite.
You should stop eatin'\nbefore you get stuffed.
If you eat too much then\nthe blood stops circulatin'\nto your head you know.
And that gets in the way of studyin'.
'Scuse me can I get another helping?
Son Goku...
Son Goku...
Father...!
G- Gohan don't you let go!
{\i1}Who is it that did all this?{\i0}
Gohan get Chichi to safety!
Kuririn Trunks you too!
Get everyone as far\naway from me as you can!
Ah! Those high heels were expensive!
Mother!
{\i1}Sure enough it looks\nlike they're only after me.{\i0}
Who are you guys?
Seeing as how I can't sense any
{\i1}Ki{\i0} from you you ain't human huh?
I get it. That means that\nyou're Artificial Humans
created by Doctor Gero huh?
He doesn't give up easily does he?
Goku-{\i1}san{\i0}!
Trunks!
Goku-{\i1}san{\i0}! If we fight here the\ncasualties will just increase!
Let's fly off to the glacial belt to\nthe north where no one else is around!
All right!
You guys come on!
Kuririn-{\i1}san{\i0}...!
Gohan unfortunately it\ndoesn't look like we have\nany part to play this time.
Our levels are too different.
But still we might be of\nsome use to them! I'm going!
--Gohan!
--No you don't!
Startin' tomorrow you've got summer\ncram school courses don't you!?
We've already paid the tuition!
B- but...!
Durin' this summer vacation
you promised me you\nwould study didn't you!?
Mother between studying and Father's\nlife which is more important!?
Ah Gohan!
See here Gohan!
Gohan!
Chichi-{\i1}san{\i0}...
I know well how Gohan must feel.
Kuririn!
What are you dawdlin' around for!?
You've got to get goin'!
Hurry up and go!
Ee-yow!
Kuririn be careful okay?
Damn. Looks like I'll never\nfind a bride in this lifetime.
Son Goku...
Nobody should have to hold back here!
Now come on!
I won't let you lay\na finger on Goku-{\i1}san{\i0}!
Trunks...
Trunks!
G- Goku-{\i1}san{\i0}...!
Not even Son Goku is able to fight\nthe way he had hoped it seems.
That Doctor Gero... Just how many
Artificial Humans did he make?
We are Artificial Humans born of\nthe computer that Doctor Gero used
for the sole purpose of killing you.
His computer? To kill me?
Doctor Gero's desire for vengeance upon\nyou was transferred into the computer.
We are what was\ncreated from the hatred
that had increased inside\nthe computer once it\nobtained the desire for vengeance.
Son Goku all of your data has\nbeen input into the computer
and we can predict any move you make.
That is why No. 15 was able\nto read your every move.
How can a computer make\nsomeone's hatred grow by itself!?
Kid our only objective\nis to kill Son Goku.
However if you get in the way\nthen that's another story!
We will kill anyone\nthat defends Son Goku!
We'll see if it\ngoes as easily as that.
Let's see if you can last even a minute\nwith No. 14 and No. 15 as your opponents.
Kuririn-{\i1}san{\i0}...
All right!
K- Kuririn-{\i1}san{\i0}?
Awesome...
We'll just have to watch how things\ngo from here for a little while.
Son Goku you will fight me now.
All of our circuits were\nbuilt in order to defeat you.
You cannot escape from this place alive.
You let innocent people get caught in\nthe crossfire while trying to kill me?
I definitely ain't letting\nyou get away with that!
Father!
Wait Gohan! At our power\nthere's nothing we can do!
Goku-{\i1}san{\i0}!
Trunks-{\i1}san{\i0}...!
Just as I should have expected.
To think that you could take that blast\nof mine head-on and still be alive...!
Father!
Gohan!
Are you saying you plan to catch\nthe whole of my {\i1}S.S. Deadly Bomber{\i0}!?
It has enough power to blow\naway half of this planet!
{\i1}What!?{\i0}
Vegeta!
Dad!
Do not misunderstand Kakarrot.
I did not come to save you.
Kakarrot will be disposed\nof at the hand of me
Vegeta-{\i1}sama{\i0} prince of the Saiyans!
Do you think I would allow\nwind-up dolls such as yourselves\nto rob me of finishing him off!?
Son Goku has yet another traveling\ncompanion into the next world.
No. 15 you take him!
Let's continue Son Goku...
What's the matter Son Goku?
I'm just barely getting warmed up!
Or is it that you're\ntoo afraid to come out?
I've heard what you guys have been\nsaying! You underestimate our power!
Don't get too carried\naway you piece of crap!
Dammit!
Kuririn-{\i1}san{\i0}!
They've done it! All three Super
Saiyans have come together!
Father!
Way to go Goku!
Father!
Stop Gohan!
Ah! Gohan don't!
Gohan!
It's Piccolo-{\i1}san{\i0}!
P- Piccolo?
Yo Son!
It's Piccolo-{\i1}san{\i0} all right!
Piccolo!
Piccolo I owe you one.
It's not over yet.
He's right.
You're Piccolo right?
If you're going to interfere\nin my fight with Son Goku
then I'll kill you too\nwhile I'm at it.
You expect me to let you\nkill me while you're {\i1}at it{\i0}?
{\i1}You're{\i0} the one who's going\nto come rattling apart!
You guys are nothing but\njunk mannequins after all!
No. 14 and No. 15\nhave been done in huh?
Vegeta!
Kakarrot Piccolo\nyou stay out of this!
I'm going to dispose of this!
Dad!
Vegeta!
Why is it always me?
Dammit!
Father!
{\i1}I{\i0} will be the one who defeats Kakarrot!
Goku... {\i1}san{\i0}...!
Father!
Kuririn-{\i1}san{\i0}!
You miserable monster!
Take this!
Kuririn-{\i1}san{\i0}!
Kuririn-{\i1}san{\i0}!
{\i1}G- give me... your Genki...{\i0}
{\i1}Share your... Genki... with me...!{\i0}
Father!
Share with me...\nshare with me... your {\i1}Genki{\i0}...!
From the seas... from the mountains...
Kakarrot belongs to me! Keep your\nhands off of him without my say-so!
Share all of your {\i1}Genki{\i0}... with me...!
Have to let Goku-{\i1}san{\i0}...\nmake that {\i1}Genki Dama...{\i0}
Come on Artificial Human!
I am he who has come from twenty\nyears into the future Trunks!
Twenty years from now on
Earth you do not exist!
That is because today here\nyou will be defeated by Goku-{\i1}san{\i0}!
Son! Show him the\npower of a Super Saiyan!
G- Goku it won't work! You can't\ncreate a {\i1}Genki Dama{\i0} as a Super Saiyan!
You can't create a {\i1}Genki
Dama{\i0} with a malicious heart!
Son Goku...!
Son Goku!!
Father!
Yo!
At the same time Goku\ntransformed into a Super Saiyan
he unconsciously drew the\nenergy from the dissipating
{\i1}Genki Dama{\i0} into himself.
That has to be it!
I don't even know!
Kuririn-{\i1}san{\i0} you did well!
You did too Trunks!
This is what happens when you don't\nkeep active every once in a while!
Oolong! Yow-ow-ow!
Don't overdo it Kuririn!
Gohan!
Hurry up and get better so\nyou can go to summer school!
By the way are Piccolo-{\i1}san{\i0} and
Vegeta-{\i1}san{\i0} going to be all right?
It's not like {\i1}they're{\i0}\ngoing to die you know!
{\i1}What is it that waits\nfor me? No one can tell!{\i0}
{\i1}An endless ploy with a thirst\nfor blood closes in without mercy!{\i0}
{\i1}We rise to face everything before\nour eyes as it becomes our time!{\i0}
{\i1}My fury (it's at its limit!) and\nyes my power (it's at its limit!){\i0}
{\i1}My threshold (it's at its limit!){\i0}
{\i1}and yes my limits
(are at their limits!){\i0}
The End
