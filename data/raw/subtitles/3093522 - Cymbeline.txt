     ( skateboard rolling )
LOOK HERE, LOVE.
THIS RING WAS MY MOTHER'S.
TAKE IT, HEART.
BUT KEEP IT TILL YOU
WOO ANOTHER WIFE,
WHEN IMOGEN IS DEAD.
                        HOW?
               HOW ANOTHER?
               GIVE ME BUT THIS.
          - I HAVE.
          - ( laughs )
REMAIN.
REMAIN THOU HERE,
WHILE SENSE CAN KEEP IT ON.
                  FOR MY SAKE...
                      WEAR THIS.
 ( motorcycle engine rumbling )
    ( sighs ) THOU BASEST THING,
    AVOID HENCE, FROM MY SIGHT.
     IF AFTER THIS COMMAND
     THOU FRAUGHT THE COURT
     WITH THY UNWORTHINESS,
                     THOU DIEST.
             AWAY.
  THOU ART POISON TO MY BLOOD.
  DISLOYAL THING
  THAT SHOULDST REPAIR MY YOUTH,
             THOU HEAPST
             A YEAR'S AGE ON ME.
    - I CHOSE AN EAGLE.
    - THOU TOOK'ST A BEGGAR,
               WOULDST HAVE MADE
               MY THRONE A SEAT
               OF BASENESS.
IT IS YOUR FAULT
THAT I HAVE LOVED POSTHUMUS.
YOU BRED HIM
AS MY PLAYFELLOW.
             WHAT, ART THOU MAD?
                    HMM...
ALMOST.
            THOU FOOLISH THING.
       THEY WERE AGAIN TOGETHER.
              YOU HAVE NOT DONE
              AFTER OUR COMMAND.
                 AWAY WITH HER
                 AND PEN HER UP.
LEAVE US TO OURSELVES,
AND MAKE YOURSELF SOME COMFORT
OUT OF YOUR BEST ADVICE.
          LET HER LANGUISH
          A DROP OF BLOOD A DAY,
              AND, BEING AGED,
              DIE OF THIS FOLLY.
( laughs )
         ( door slams )
NO, BE ASSURED
YOU SHALL NOT FIND ME,
AFTER THE SLANDER
OF MOST STEPMOTHERS,
EVIL-EYED UNTO YOU.
YOU ARE MY PRISONER,
BUT THE JAILER
SHALL DELIVER YOU THE KEY.
                       ( sighs )
               ¶¶
THAT SHE SHOULD LOVE
THIS FELLOW AND REFUSE ME.
         SHE IS DAMNED.
HER BRAINS AND HER BEAUTY
GO NOT TOGETHER.
   SHE SHINES NOT UPON FOOLS.
HE HATH BEEN
YOUR FAITHFUL SERVANT.
I DARE LAY MY HONOR
HE WILL REMAIN SO.
I BESEECH YOU, BE BETTER
KNOWN TO THIS GENTLEMAN,
WHOM I COMMEND TO YOU
AS A NOBLE FRIEND OF MINE.
HIS FATHER AND I WERE
SOLDIERS TOGETHER.
          SIR, WE HAVE KNOWN
          EACH OTHER IN ORLEANS.
BY YOUR PARDON, I WAS
THEN A YOUNG TRAVELER.
BUT UPON MY MENDED JUDGMENT,
IF I OFFEND NOT
TO SAY IT IS MENDED,
MY QUARREL WAS NOT
ALTOGETHER SLIGHT.
    CAN WE WITH MANNERS
    ASK WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE?
SAFELY, I THINK.
IT WAS A CONTENTION IN PUBLIC.
WHERE EACH OF US FELL IN PRAISE
OF OUR COUNTRY MISTRESSES,
THIS GENTLEMEN
AT THAT TIME VOUCHING--
         AND UPON WARRANT
         OF BLOODY AFFIRMATION--
HIS TO BE MORE FAIR,
VIRTUOUS, WISE,
CHASTE, CONSTANT,
QUALIFIED,
AND LESS ATTEMPTABLE
THAN ANY OF THE RAREST
OF THE LADIES IN FRANCE.
    THAT LADY IS NOT NOW LIVING,
     OR THAT GENTLEMAN'S OPINION
     BY THIS WORN OUT.
  SHE HOLDS HER VIRTUE STILL,
  AND I MY MIND.
             IF SHE WENT BEFORE
             OTHERS I HAVE SEEN,
  AS THAT DIAMOND OF YOURS
  OUTLUSTERS MANY I HAVE BEHELD,
         I COULD NOT BUT BELIEVE
         SHE EXCELLED MANY.
    BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOST
    PRECIOUS DIAMOND THAT IS,
- NOR YOU THE LADY.
- I PRAISED HER AS I RATED HER.
  - SO DO I MY STONE.
  - WHAT DO YOU ESTEEM IT AT?
  ( chuckles )
  MORE THAN THE WORLD ENJOYS.
              MM. YOUR MISTRESS
              IS NOW EITHER DEAD
      OR OUT-PRIZED BY A TRIFLE.
       YOU ARE MISTAKEN.
THE RING MAY BE SOLD OR GIVEN.
THE OTHER IS NOT
A THING FOR SALE,
AND ONLY A GIFT OF THE GODS.
                 WHICH THE GODS
                 HAVE GIVEN YOU?
Posthumus: WHICH,
BY THEIR GRACES, I WILL KEEP.
               YOU MAY WEAR HER
               IN TITLE YOURS,
     BUT YOU KNOW STRANGE FOWL
     LIGHT ON NEIGHBORING PONDS.
 LET US LEAVE HERE, GENTLEMAN.
            Iachimo: NO, NO, NO.
           I DARE PAWN MY ESTATE
           TO YOUR RING,
        WHICH IN MY OPINION
        OVERVALUES IT SOMETHING.
      BUT I MAKE MY WAGER RATHER
      AGAINST YOUR CONFIDENCE
            THAN HER REPUTATION.
     WHAT LADY WOULD
     YOU CHOOSE TO ASSAIL?
        YOURS, WHOM IN CONSTANCY
        YOU THINK SO SAFE.
              I LAY TEN THOUSAND
              TO YOUR RING
       THAT, COMMEND ME TO THE
       COURT WHERE YOUR LADY IS,
        WITH NO MORE ADVANTAGE
        THAN OPPORTUNITY
        FOR A SECOND CONFERENCE,
      AND I WILL TAKE THAT HONOR
      OF HERS FROM THENCE
  WHICH YOU IMAGINE SO RESERVED.
      EVEN IF YOU BUY LADIES'
      FLESH AT A MILLION A DRAM,
           YOU CANNOT PREVENT IT
           FROM TAINTING.
I DARE YOU TO THIS MATCH.
HERE IS MY RING.
   IF I BRING YOU NO SUFFICIENT
   TESTIMONY THAT I HAVE ENJOYED
         THE DEAREST BODILY PART
         OF YOUR MISTRESS,
      MY TEN THOUSAND ARE YOURS,
      AND SO YOUR RING.
ENOUGH OF THIS.
LET IT DIE AS IT WERE BORN.
I EMBRACE THESE CONDITIONS.
LET US HAVE ARTICLES BETWIXT US.
         ( unzipping )
Posthumus: IF YOU
MAKE YOUR VOYAGE UPON HER
AND GIVE TO ME DIRECTLY
YOU HAVE PREVAILED,
I AM NO FURTHER YOUR ENEMY.
SHE IS NOT WORTH THE DEBATE.
IF SHE REMAINS UNSEDUCED,
FOR YOUR ILL OPINION
AND THE ASSAULT YOU HAVE MADE
TO HER CHASTITY...
YOU WILL ANSWER MY SWORD.
          YOUR HAND, A COVENANT.
               ¶¶
         ( dogs barking )
         MASTER DOCTOR.
HAVE YOU BROUGHT
THOSE DRUGS?
     PLEASETH YOUR HIGHNESS, AY.
           HERE THEY ARE, MADAM.
      BUT I BESEECH YOUR GRACE,
      MY CONSCIENCE BIDS ME ASK,
            WHEREFORE YOU
            HAVE COMMANDED OF ME
            THESE MOST
            POISONOUS COMPOUNDS,
         WHICH ARE THE MOVERS
         OF A LANGUISHING DEATH,
        BUT THOUGH SLOW, DEADLY.
I WILL TEST THE FORCES
OF THESE THY COMPOUNDS
ON SUCH CREATURES AS WE
COUNT NOT WORTH THE HANGING,
BUT NONE HUMAN.
         ( dogs barking )
     NO FURTHER SERVICE, DOCTOR,
     UNTIL I SEND FOR THEE.
GOOD MORROW TO YOUR MAJESTY.
    AMBASSADOR'S FROM ROME.
                   CAIUS LUCIUS.
           A MOST WORTHY FELLOW.
           ALBEIT HE COMES
           ON ANGRY PURPOSE NOW.
     BUT THAT'S NO FAULT OF HIS.
   WE MUST RECEIVE HIM ACCORDING
   TO THE HONOR OF HIS SENDER.
OUR DEAR SON,
WE WILL HAVE NEED TO EMPLOY YOU
    TOWARDS THIS ROMAN.
( sighs )
WHY SHOULD WE PAY TRIBUTE?
IF CAESAR CAN HIDE THE SUN
FROM US WITH A BLANKET
OR PUT THE MOON
IN HIS POCKET,
WE WILL PAY HIM TRIBUTE
FOR LIGHT.
ELSE, SIR,
NO MORE TRIBUTE.
       YOU MUST KNOW,
       TILL THE INJURIOUS ROMANS
         DID EXTORT THIS TRIBUTE
         FROM US, WE WERE FREE.
           CAESAR'S AMBITION,
           WHICH SWELLED SO MUCH
         IT ALMOST STRETCHED
         THE SIDES OF THE WORLD,
       AGAINST ALL COLOR HERE
       DID PUT THE YOKE UPON US,
       WHICH TO SHAKE OFF
       BECOMES A WARLIKE PEOPLE.
                WHOM WE RECKON
                OURSELVES TO BE.
     I AM SORRY, CYMBELINE,
     THAT I AM TO PRONOUNCE
  AUGUSTUS CAESAR THINE ENEMY.
   OUR SUBJECTS, SIR,
   WILL NOT ENDURE HIS YOKE,
   AND FOR OURSELF TO SHOW
   LESS SOVEREIGNTY THAN THEY
 MUST NEEDS APPEAR UN-KINGLIKE.
   RECEIVE IT FROM ME, THEN:
   WAR AND CONFUSION.
    FURY NOT TO BE RESISTED.
      THE EVENT IS YET
      TO NAME THE WINNER.
        FARE THEE WELL.
WE WILL NOTHING PAY
FOR WEARING OUR NOSES.
         HE GOES HENCE FROWNING,
        BUT IT HONORS US THAT
        WE HAVE GIVEN HIM CAUSE.
               ¶¶

    Imogen: O, THAT HUSBAND,
    MY SUPREME CROWN OF GRIEF.
     ( cell phone vibrates )
     Amy: A noble gentleman
      of Rome comes from
      my lord with letters.
            THE WORTHY POSTHUMUS
            IS IN SAFETY
           AND GREETS
           YOUR HIGHNESS DEARLY.
THANKS, GOOD SIR.
YOU'RE KINDLY WELCOME.
   - HIS HEALTH, BESEECH YOU?
   - WELL, MADAM.
    IS HE DISPOSED TO MIRTH?
    I HOPE HE IS.
 THERE'S NONE A STRANGER THERE
 SO MERRY AND SO GAMESOME.
   HE IS CALLED THE REVELER.
   WHEN HE WAS HERE
   HE DID INCLINE TO SADNESS,
 AND OFTTIMES NOT KNOWING WHY.
      I NEVER SAW HIM SAD.
        YOU LOOK ON ME.
       WHAT WRACK DISCERN YOU
       IN ME DESERVES YOUR PITY?
        ( doorbell rings )
LAMENTABLE.
     - WHY DO YOU PITY ME?
     - THAT OTHERS DO.
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY, ENJOY--
BUT IT IS AN OFFICE OF THE GODS
TO AVENGE IT, NOT MINE
TO SPEAK ON IT.
        YOU DO SEEM
        TO KNOW SOMETHING OF ME,
            OR WHAT CONCERNS ME.
           PRAY YOU, SINCE
           FEARING THINGS GO ILL
        OFTEN HURTS MORE
        THAN TO BE SURE THEY DO,
 FOR CERTAINTIES ARE EITHER PAST
 REMEDIES OR TIMELY KNOWING,
    THE REMEDY THEN BORN, JUST--
         DISCOVER TO ME WHAT
         YOU BOTH SPUR AND STOP.
HAD I THIS CHEEK
TO BATHE MY LIPS UPON;
THIS HAND, WHOSE TOUCH,
WHOSE EVERY TOUCH,
WOULD FORCE THE FEELER'S
SOUL TO THE OATH OF LOYALTY;
THIS OBJECT WHICH TAKES PRISONER
THE WILD MOTIONS OF MINE EYE,
AND FIXES IT ONLY HERE,
SHOULD I, DAMNED THEN,
     - SLAVER WITH LIPS...
     - ( doorbell rings )
AS COMMON AS STAIRS
THAT MOUNT THE CAPITAL,
IT WERE FIT ALL
THE PLAGUES OF HELL
SHOULD AT ONE TIME
ENCOUNTER SUCH REVOLT.
O DEAREST SOUL,
THY CAUSE DOTH STRIKE
MY HEART WITH A PITY
THAT MAKES ME SICK.
A LADY, SO FAIR,
AND FASTENED TO AN EMPERY
THAT WOULD
THE GREATEST KING DOUBLE,
TO BE PARTNERED
WITH-- WITH TOMBOYS--
    DISEASED VENTURES
AND SUCH BOILED STUFF
AS MIGHT WELL POISON POISON.
BE REVENGED,
OR SHE THAT BORE YOU
WAS NO QUEEN,
AND YOU RECOIL
FROM YOUR GREAT STOCK.
                    ( chuckles )
                       REVENGED?
       HOW SHOULD I BE REVENGED?
       IF THIS BE TRUE,
       HOW SHOULD I BE REVENGED?
I DEDICATE MYSELF
TO YOUR SWEET PLEASURE.
MORE NOBLE THAN THAT
RENEGADE FROM YOUR BED.
AND WILL CONTINUE FAST TO YOUR
AFFECTION STILL CLOSE AS SURE.
LET ME MY SERVICE TENDER
ON YOUR LIPS.
I DO CONDEMN MINE EARS THAT
HATH ATTENDED THEE SO LONG.
            PISANIO.
THE KING MY FATHER SHALL BE
MADE ACQUAINTED OF THY ASSAULT.
 AND IF HE SHALL THINK IT FIT
 A SAUCY STRANGER IN HIS COURT
      TO EXPOUND HIS
      BEASTLY MIND TO US,
 THEN HE HATH A COURT HE LITTLE
 CARES FOR AND A DAUGHTER
  WHO HE NOT RESPECTS AT ALL.
            GIVE ME YOUR PARDON.
   I... I SPOKE THIS TO KNOW
      IF YOUR AFFIANCE
      WERE DEEPLY ROOTED,
  AND SHALL MAKE YOUR LORD
  THAT WHICH HE IS, NEW O'ER.
    HE IS ONE
    OF THE TRUEST MANNERED,
        HE... ( laughs )
       SUCH A HOLY WITCH
             AS MIGHT ENCHANTS
             SOCIETIES UNTO HIM.
                 HALF ALL MEN'S
                 HEARTS ARE HIS.
     HE SITS AMONG MEN
     LIKE A DESCENDED GOD.
      HE HATH A-- A KIND
      OF HONOR ABOUT HIM,
     SETS HIM OFF MORE
     THAN A MORTAL SEEMING.
           BE NOT ANGRY,
           MOST MIGHTY PRINCESS,
     THAT I HAVE ADVENTURED YOUR
     TAKING OF A FALSE REPORT.
             THE LOVE I BEAR HIM
        MADE ME TO FAN YOU THUS.
      ( soft piano music )
BUT THE GODS MADE YOU,
UNLIKE ALL THE OTHERS.
PRAY, YOUR PARDON.
                ALL'S WELL, SIR.
          TAKE MY POWER
          IN THE COURT OF YOURS.
UH, I HAD BUT--
I ALMOST FORGOT, UH...
          WHAT IS IT?
SOME DOZEN OF US AND YOUR LORD,
 THE BEST FEATHER IN OUR WING,
HAVE MINGLED SUMS
TO BUY A PRESENT.
AND I AM SOMEWHAT CURIOUS
TO HAVE SAFE STORAGE.
MAY IT PLEASE YOU
TO TAKE IT IN PROTECTION?
FOR THIS NIGHT ONLY.
I MUST ABOARD TOMORROW.

    YOUR LADY BEING SO EASY.
UH, IF YOU CAN
MAKE IT APPARENT
THAT YOU HAVE
TASTED HER IN BED,
MY HAND AND RING
ARE YOURS.
IF NOT, THE FOUL OPINION
YOU HAD OF HER PURE HONOR
GAINS OR LOSES,
YOUR SWORD OR MINE.
     FIRST, HER BEDCHAMBER,
  WHERE I CONFESS I SLEPT NOT,
      BUT PROFESS HAD THAT
 WHICH WAS WELL WORTH WATCHING.
    LET IT BE GRANTED
    YOU HAVE SEEN ALL THIS,
     THE DESCRIPTION OF
     WHAT IS IN HER CHAMBER
    NOTHING SAVES
    THE WAGER YOU HAVE LAID.
             UH...
              SEE.
      THIS MUST BE MARRIED
      TO YOUR DIAMOND.
       LET ME BEHOLD IT.
        IS IT THAT WHICH
        I LEFT WITH HER?
    SHE GAVE IT ME,
    SHE SAID SHE PRIZED IT ONCE.
MAYBE SHE PLUCKED IT OFF
TO SEND TO ME.
             HM...
       SHE WRITES YOU SO,

            IT MAY BE PROBABLE
            THAT SHE HAS LOST IT
            OR, WHO KNOWS,
            IF ONE OF HER WOMEN,
        BEING CORRUPTED,
        HATH STOLEN IT FROM HER.
VERY TRUE.
SHE WOULD NOT LOSE IT.
    ALL OF HER ATTENDANTS
    ARE SWORN AND HONORABLE.
    THEY INDUCED TO STEAL IT,
    AND BY A STRANGER?
      - NO!
      - ( ring clatters )

SHE HATH BOUGHT THE NAME
OF WHORE THUS DEARLY.
     IF YOU DESIRE FURTHER
     SATISFACTION,
      UNDER HER BREAST,
      WORTHY THE PRESSING,
 LIES THERE A MOLE, RIGHT PROUD
 OF THAT MOST DELICATE LODGING.
     BY MY LIFE I SWEAR...
          I KISSED IT,
 AND THOUGH FULL IT GAVE ME
 PRESENT HUNGER TO FEED AGAIN.
      DO YOU DO REMEMBER
      THIS STAIN UPON HER?
              AY.
      AND IT DOTH CONFIRM
      ANOTHER STAIN
    AS BIG AS HELL CAN HOLD.
      SHALL YOU HEAR MORE?
            ( sobs )
    O, THAT I HAD HER HERE,
     TO TEAR HER LIMBMEAL.
        I WILL GO THERE,
    THEN DO IT IN THE COURT

READ, AND TELL ME HOW FAR IT IS.
AND HOW MAY WE STEAL FROM HENCE,
AND FOR THE GAP AND OUR RETURN,
TO EXCUSE.
   BUT FIRST, HOW GET HENCE?
     SPEAK. HOW MANY MILES?
        TWENTY MILES 'TWIXT
        SUN AND SUN, MADAM.
        IT'S ENOUGH FOR YOU
        AND TOO MUCH TOO.
Arviragus: WE HAVE SEEN NOTHING;
WE ARE BEASTLY.
    Belarius: HOW YOU SPEAK.
   O BOYS, THIS STORY
   THE WORLD MAY READ IN ME:
MY BODY'S MARKED
WITH ROMAN SWORDS.
MY REPORT WAS ONCE FIRST
WITH THE BEST OF NOTE:
CYMBELINE LOVED ME,
AND WHEN A SOLDIER
WAS THE THEME,
MY NAME WAS NOT FAR OFF:
THEN WAS I AS A TREE.
  Belarius: VILLAINS,
   WHOSE FALSE OATHS PREVAILED
     BEFORE MY PERFECT HONOR,
  SWORE TO CYMBELINE I WAS
  CONFEDERATE WITH THE ROMANS:
     O CYMBELINE! HEAVEN
     AND MY CONSCIENCE KNOWS
  THOU DIDST UNJUSTLY BANISH ME:
WHEREON, AT THREE AND TWO YEARS
OLD, I STOLE THESE BOYS.
  AND THIS TWENTY YEARS
  THIS ROCK HAS BEEN MY WORLD;
        WHERE I HAVE LIVED
        AT HONEST FREEDOM,
      PAID MORE PIOUS DEBTS
      TO HEAVEN
    THAN IN ALL
    THE FORE-END OF MY TIME.
   THESE BOYS KNOW LITTLE
   THEY ARE SONS TO THE KING;
       NOR CYMBELINE DREAMS
       THAT THEY ARE ALIVE.
  THEY THINK THEY ARE MINE; AND
  THOUGH TRAINED UP THUS MEANLY
      THEIR THOUGHTS DO HIT
      THE ROOFS OF PALACES.
               ¶¶
    Posthumus: O, VENGEANCE,
     VENGEANCE.
    COULD I FIND OUT
    THE WOMAN'S PART IN ME...
   FOR THERE'S NO MOTION
   THAT TENDS TO VICE IN MAN,
      BUT I AFFIRM IT
      IS THE WOMAN'S PART.
      BE IT LYING, NOTE IT,
  THE WOMAN'S; FLATTERING, HERS;
         DECEIVING, HERS;
     LUST AND RANK THOUGHTS,
     HERS, HERS;
         REVENGES, HERS.
      AMBITIONS, COVETINGS,
    CHANGE OF PRIDES, DISDAIN,
      SLANDERS, MUTABILITY.
       ALL FAULTS THAT
       HAVE A NAME, HERS.
           DETEST THEM,
           CURSE THEM.
             WHERE IS POSTHUMUS?
           WHAT IS IN THY MIND,
           THAT THEE STARE THUS?
   Imogen: "THY MISTRESS
    HATH PLAYED THE STRUMPET
    IN MY BED...
     THE TESTIMONIES WHEREOF
     LIE BLEEDING IN ME.
I SPEAK NOT OUT OF WEAK SURMISE
BUT FROM PROOF AS STRONG
   AS MY GRIEF AND AS CERTAIN
   AS I EXPECT MY REVENGE.
    THAT PART, THOU, PISANIO,
      YOU MUST ACT FOR ME."
  "IF THY FAITH BE NOT TAINTED
  WITH THE BREACH OF HERS,
      LET THINE OWN HAND
      TAKE AWAY HER LIFE.
 IF THOU FEAR TO STRIKE AND
 TO MAKE ME CERTAIN IT IS DONE,
      THOU ART THE PANDER
      TO HER DISHONOR
  AND EQUALLY TO ME DISLOYAL."
       FALSE TO HIS BED?
    WHAT IS IT TO BE FALSE?
     TO LIE THERE IN WATCH
     AND TO THINK ON HIM?
   NO... NO, NO. ON MY LIFE.
      WHERE'S THY KNIFE? WHERE?!
      THOU ART TOO SLOW
      TO DO THY MASTER'S BIDDING
      WHEN I DESIRE IT TOO.
                     ( sobbing )
SINCE I RECEIVED COMMAND
TO DO THIS BUSINESS,
I HAVE NOT SLEPT ONE WINK.
  WELL, DO IT, AND TO BED, THEN.
I'LL WAKE MINE
EYEBALLS BLIND FIRST.
                    WHY?
     WHY HAS THOU ABUSED SO MANY
     MILES WITH A PRETENSE?
       THIS PLACE?
       BRING ME HERE TO KILL ME?
    BUT TO WIN TIME.
I HAVE CONSIDERED A COURSE.
HEAR ME. HEAR ME WITH PATIENCE.
IT CANNOT BE BUT
THAT MY MASTER IS ABUSED.
SOME VILLAIN, AY,
AND SINGULAR IN HIS ART,
HATH DONE YOU BOTH THIS...
THIS CURSED INJURY.
I'LL GIVE BUT NOTICE
YOU ARE DEAD,
AND SEND HIM
SOME BLOODY SIGN OF IT,
FOR 'TIS COMMANDED
I SHOULD DO SO.
YOU SHALL BE MISSED AT COURT,
AND THAT WILL WELL CONFIRM IT.
    NOW, HERE'S THE POINT:
IF YOU COULD WEAR A MIND
DARK AS YOUR FORTUNE IS,
FORGET TO BE A WOMAN.
        CHANGE.
           I SEE INTO THY END...
    AND AM ALMOST A MAN ALREADY.

        THIS ATTEMPT...
        I AM SOLDIER TO,
    AND WILL ABIDE IT
    WITH A PRINCE'S COURAGE.
        FROM THE QUEEN.
        WHAT'S IN'T IS PRECIOUS.
           A DRAM OF THIS WILL
           DRIVE AWAY DISTEMPER.
   WE MUST TAKE A SHORT FAREWELL
   LEST BEING MISSED,
        I BE SUSPECTED OF YOUR
        CARRIAGE FROM THE COURT.
AWAY, I PRITHEE.
     WHERE IS OUR DAUGHTER?
           ( groans )
      CALL HER BEFORE US.
   SINCE THE EXILE OF POSTHUMUS,
               MOST RETIRED HATH
               HER LIFE BEEN,
      THE CURE WHEREOF, MY LORD,
      'TIS TIME MUST DO.
         WHERE IS SHE?
      HOW CAN HER CONTEMPT
      BE ANSWERED?
THAT MAN OF HERS, PISANIO,
HER OLD SERVANT,
I HAVE NOT SEEN
THESE TWO DAYS.
                 GO, LOOK AFTER.
  ( motorcycle engine revving )
            PISANIO!
     COME HITHER! VILLAIN.
      SHE SAID UPON A TIME
  THE BITTERNESS OF IT
  I NOW BELCH FROM MY HEART...
 THAT SHE HELD THE VERY GARMENT
          OF POSTHUMUS
        IN MORE RESPECT
        THAN MY NOBLE
      AND NATURAL PERSON.
( footsteps approaching )
         WHERE IS SHE?
           I WILL NOT ASK AGAIN.
THIS IS THE HISTORY OF MY
KNOWLEDGE TOUCHING HER FLIGHT.
IS SHE WITH POSTHUMUS?
                     AS I THINK.
HOW LONG IS'T SHE WENT
TO MILFORD HAVEN?
                  SHE CAN SCARCE
                  BE THERE YET.
GIVE ME THY HAND.
HAST ANY OF THY MASTER'S
GARMENTS IN THY POSSESSION?
           THE SAME SUIT HE WORE
           WHEN HE TOOK LEAVE.
FETCH THAT SUIT HITHER.
BE A VOLUNTARY MUTE
TO MY DESIGN.
( whispers ) GO.
               ¶¶
  WITH THE SUIT UPON MY BACK,
       I WILL RAVISH HER.
     FIRST, KILL POSTHUMUS,
        AND IN HER EYES.
 THERE SHALL SHE SEE MY VALOR,
  WHICH WILL THEN BE A TORMENT
        TO HER CONTEMPT.
           ( sighs )
   Cloten: HE ON THE GROUND,
     MY SPEECH AN INSULTMENT
     ENDED ON HIS DEAD BODY,
   AND ONCE MY LUST HATH DINED,
    WHICH AS I SAY TO VEX HER
  I WILL EXECUTE IN THE CLOTHES
  THAT SHE SO PRAISED.
      TO THE COURT
      I'LL KNOCK HER BACK.
          ( knocking )
          WHO'S THERE?
             MM...
     ( vehicle approaching )
AN ANGEL HERE.
NO ELDER THAN A BOY.
      GOOD MASTERS, HARM ME NOT.
        BEFORE I ENTERED HERE,
        I THOUGHT TO HAVE BEGGED
          OR BOUGHT WHAT I TOOK.
                   HERE'S MONEY.
           I WOULD HAVE LEFT IT
           ON THE BOARD AS SOON
           AS I HAD MADE MY MEAL
         AND PARTED WITH PRAYERS
         FOR THE PROVIDER.
                    MONEY?
        ALL GOLD AND SILVER
        RATHER TURN TO DIRT.
AS 'TIS NO BETTER RECKONED BUT
OF THOSE WHO WORSHIP DIRTY GODS.
             I SEE YOU'RE ANGRY.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

   Posthumus: LET ME MAKE MEN
    KNOW MORE VALOR IN ME
    THAN MY HABITS SHOW.
    GODS, GIVE ME THE STRENGTH
    TO SHAME THE
    GUISE O' THE WORLD,
    I WILL BEGIN THE FASHION,
           LESS WITHOUT
         AND MORE WITHIN.
       STAND BY MY SIDE,
   YOU WHOM THE GODS HAVE MADE
   PRESERVERS OF MY THRONE.
     KNIGHTS OF THE BATTLE,
    I CREATE YOU COMPANIONS
    TO OUR PERSON,
  - AND FIT YOU WITH DIGNITIES
  BEFITTING YOUR ESTATES--
  - ( tires screeching )
          WHY SO SADLY
          GREET YOU OUR VICTORY?
HAIL, GREAT KING.
TO SOUR YOUR HAPPINESS,
I MUST REPORT THE QUEEN IS DEAD.
       ( screaming ) NO!
   Cymbeline: HOW ENDED SHE?
    Cornelius: WITH HORROR,
     MADLY DYING,
    LIKE HER LIFE, WHICH,
    BEING CRUEL TO THE WORLD,
      CONCLUDED MOST CRUEL
      TO HERSELF.
THESE HER WOMEN WERE PRESENT
WHEN SHE FINISHED.
Cornelius: FIRST, SHE CONFESSED
SHE NEVER LOVED YOU,
    ONLY AFFECTED GREATNESS
    GOT BY YOU, NOT YOU;
     MARRIED YOUR ROYALTY,
     WIFE TO YOUR PLACE;
     ABHORRED YOUR PERSON.
      SHE ALONE KNEW THIS.
YOUR DAUGHTER SHE DID CONFESS
WAS AS A SCORPION TO HER SIGHT,
          WHOSE LIFE,
      BUT THAT HER FLIGHT
      PREVENTED IT,
  SHE HAD TA'EN OFF BY POISON.
    MINE EYES WERE NOT IN FAULT,
    FOR...
              SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL.
        MINE EARS,
        THAT HEARD HER FLATTERY.
      NOR MY HEART, THAT THOUGHT
      HER LIKE HER SEEMING.
       ( zipping up bag )
     IT HAD BEEN VICIOUS
     TO HAVE MISTRUSTED HER.
         O MY DAUGHTER.
       THAT IT WAS MY FOLLY,
       THOU MAYST SAY.
 THE DAY WAS YOURS BY ACCIDENT.
      HAD IT GONE WITH US,
      WE SHOULD NOT,
 WHEN THE BLOOD WAS COOL,
 HAVE THREATENED OUR PRISONERS
 WITH THE SWORD.
            BUT LET IT COME.
Cymbeline: THAT DIAMOND ON YOUR
FINGER, HOW CAME IT YOURS?
BY VILLAINY I GOT THIS RING.
    THE GOOD POSTHUMUS.
    WHAT CAN I SAY?
HE WERE TOO GOOD TO BE
WHERE ILL MEN WERE--
Cymbeline: I STAND ON FIRE.
COME TO THE MATTER.
 YOUR DAUGHTER'S CHASTITY. OW!
 THERE IT BEGINS!
    - Cymbeline: MY DAUGHTER?
   - I WAGERED WITH HIM
         PIECES OF GOLD AGAINST
         THIS WHICH THEN HE WORE
         UPON HIS HONORED FINGER
         TO ATTAIN IN SUIT
         THE PLACE OF HIS BED...
        TO WIN THIS RING BY HERS
        AND MINE ADULTERY.
            AT COURT, I LEARNED
            YOUR CHASTE DAUGHTER
  AND THE WIDE DIFFERENCE
  'TWIXT VILLAINOUS AND AMOROUS.
               YET... I RETURNED
               WITH PROOF ENOUGH
               TO MAKE THE NOBLE
               POSTHUMUS MAD.
      AY.
    ME, MOST CREDULOUS FOOL,
      O, GIVE ME CORD,
      OR KNIFE, OR POISON.
     I KILLED THY DAUGHTER.
         CAUSED A LESSER VILLAIN
         THAN MYSELF TO DO IT.
        SPIT AND THROW STONES,
            CAST MIRE UPON ME.
        ( sighs ) IMOGEN.
        MY QUEEN, MY WIFE.
          - MY LIFE...
          - PEACE.
        - O IMOGEN...
        - MY LORD, HEAR.
 - SHALL'S HAVE A PLAY OF THIS?
 - ( grunts )
             YOU NEVER KILLED
             IMOGEN... TILL NOW.
        ( Imogen groans )
GET THEE FROM MY SIGHT.
THOU GAVEST ME POISON.
I HAD IT FROM THE QUEEN--
Cornelius: OH GODS.
I LEFT OUT ONE THING
THE QUEEN CONFESSED.
THE QUEEN, SIR, VERY OFTEN
IMPORTUNED ME TO, UM,
TEMPER POTIONS FOR HER,
STILL PRETENDING THE
SATISFACTION OF HER KNOWLEDGE
ONLY IN KILLING CREATURES VILE,
CATS AND DOGS.
  I, DREADING THAT HER PURPOSE
  WAS OF MORE DANGER,
      DID COMPOUND FOR HER
      A CERTAIN STUFF
WHICH BEING TA'EN WOULD CEASE
THE PRESENT POWER OF LIFE,
AND IN SHORT TIME
ALL OFFICES OF NATURE
   SHOULD DO THEIR DUE FUNCTION.
           HAVE YOU TA'EN OF IT?
    I MUST HAVE, FOR I WAS DEAD.
HANG THERE LIKE FRUIT,
MY SOUL,
TILL THE TREE DIE.
       Cymbeline: IMOGEN.
Imogen: YOUR BLESSING, SIR.
       THE QUEEN'S DEAD.
Imogen: I'M SORRY FOR IT.
        SHE WAS NAUGHT.
                HER SON IS GONE,
                WE KNOW NOT HOW.
           LET ME END THE STORY.
                     I SLEW HIM.
            HE DID PROVOKE ME.
 I CUT OFF HIS HEAD
 AND AM RIGHT GLAD HE IS NOT
 STANDING HERE TO TELL THE TALE.
 MIGHTY SIR, THESE TWO YOUNG
 GENTLEMEN THAT CALL ME FATHER
   AND THINK THEY ARE MY SONS
   ARE NONE OF MINE.
  THEY ARE THE ISSUE
  OF YOUR LOINS, MY LIEGE,
  THE BLOOD OF YOUR BEGETTING.
              HOW?
I AM BELARIUS WHOM YOU BANISHED.
   THESE GENTLE PRINCES,
   FOR SUCH AND SO THEY ARE,
       THESE TWENTY YEARS
       HAVE I TRAINED UP.
           BUT HERE--
   HERE ARE YOUR SONS AGAIN,
   AND I MUST LOSE TWO
   OF THE SWEETEST COMPANIONS
   IN THE WORLD.
    GUIDERIUS UPON HIS NECK
    HAD A... A MOLE,
        A SANGUINE STAR.
                     THIS IS HE.
                   CAIUS LUCIUS.
            ALTHOUGH THE VICTOR,
      WE SUBMIT TO CAESAR
      AND TO THE ROMAN EMPIRE...
            PROMISING TO PAY
            OUR WONTED TRIBUTE,
    FROM WHICH WE WERE DISSUADED
    BY OUR WICKED QUEEN.
   PARDON'S THE WORD TO ALL.
