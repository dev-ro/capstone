Have you brought the gold, don?
l have brought all the gold
you asked for, Raj Singh.
Money can buy gold
from the market, don.
Why would we come here?
Give that gold to me.
Throw that briefcase here!
Aren't you scared of
death, Raj Singh?
Those threats are of no use, don.
Throw that briefcase here.
Or else...
All right. l'll forget
this gold worth a million.
But l'll certainly remember you.
Here you are.
As an officer from lnterpol...
l have worked with the police force
of many countries.
This is my first visit to lndia;
it's a new country for me.
But the names of the
people in this file...
aren't those we have
never heard before.
They're a gang of
international smugglers.
Gold, silver, drugs...
they're into everything.
They are wanted by the police
in many countries.
They have even been arrested
on some occasions...
but were acquitted by the courts
for lack of evidence.
According to our information...
they have now made Bombay
their headquarters.
What are the prominent names
in the file, Mr. D.S.P...?
One moment, Mr. Mullick.
l'll read out the names.
Shyam Narang, Ranjit Thakur,
Harihar Jariwala, Atmaprakash...
and the most dreaded of
these criminals... Don.
Don! Why have you shot him?
What harm had he done to you?
Will Rajesh come alive
if l tell you, Narang?
But there must've been a reason!
There is.
Look at his feet.
l didn't like the sight
of the shoes he wore.
You hated his shoes, did you?
You have shot a competent man...
Ramesh, take off that
shoe from his left foot.
Now turn the heel around.
Go on.
My God! lt has some papers!
This chap was actually
a cop, Narang.
He was a police informer.
Look at this.
All the information against us
and the numbers.
The fact that he was an informer
was known to you, to me...
and to those officers who were
present at the meeting.
Right?
- Sure.
And they could still discover
that he was an informer.
Don't entertain the idea that one of
my officers are involved with them.
Okay... but couldn't one
of them be involved with us?
What time is it?
- 3 p.m.
Nice watch.
A saw one in a shop at Geneva.
l couldn't buy it...
it was too expensive.
lt was presented to me
by a friend.
Who's that?
l'm glad you're here, Roma.
You're the only one who can
make your brother see reason.
What's wrong now?
Have you changed your mind again?
You don't know them.
lf they as much as suspect that
l'm planning on quitting them.
You don't know Don.
l don't want to know him either.
Before they can suspect anything,...
Kamini and you will be
thousands of miles away.
Here are the tickets.
l'm your sister, Ramesh...
You must listen to me.
Ramesh is trying to run away.
He could prove to be dangerous
for us, if he escaped.
lt's dangerous to let him live.
We mustn't be careless.
l have never been careless, Narang.
l can see that.
We have more enemies than friends
in this profession, Don.
lt's risky for you to be
a sauna-bath in these hotels.
To the airport, driver.
Quick!
Why have you stopped?
You don't know them.
lf they even suspect that
l'm planning on quitting them...
You don't know Don.
What are you staring for?
- What was the name?
Sonia.
- Yes... Sonia.
There is this species of girls
l don't like, Sonia.
Girls who take their own time
in giving in to me...
and those who throw
themselves at me.
And l have thrown myself
at you, haven't l?
We didn't even know each other
four hours ago.
And here we are,
sharing a room in this hotel.
Why?
Having met you, l felt as if l have
always been looking for you.
l find this romantic stuff
very boring, Sonia.
But l speak the truth.
You may tell everything about
the Sun and the Moon...
but never know about what
goes on in a girl's mind.
l'm not interested in a girl's mind.
Which is why l'm still alive.
How about another drink?
This is Kamini here!
Yes, he's here!
At Hotel Blue Gem.
He's about to leave.
No... hold him there for some time.
We're coming over.
Auntie!
l'll be coming home in a while, l say!
Don't get worried.
That's my aunt! She worries
herself sick when l'm late.
ln that case, bring her along
when you meet me next.
Stay a while, Don.
What's the hurry?
What can keep me here
any longer anyway?
''This heart of mine...
it's crazy about my lover''
''Crazy, it's crazy...
it's crazy about love''
''l very well know how to scorch myself
in the fires of love''
''lt's difficult for you
to escape, darling''
''This heart of mine...
it's crazy about my lover''
''This heart of mine...
it's crazy about my lover''
''A heart is fulfilled when

''Love is fulfilled when one

''A heart is fulfilled when

''Love is fulfilled when one
lays down her life for her love''
''l will have your life
for a life that was''
''This heart of mine...
it's crazy about my lover''
''Crazy, it's crazy...
it's crazy about love''
''Every moment,
a storm rages in my heart''
''l have reached my goal;
the goal l aspired for''
''Every moment,
a storm rages in my heart''
''l have reached my goal;
the goal l aspired for''
''You will never forget
how our hearts clash''
''This heart of mine...

''Crazy, it's crazy...

''l very well know how to scorch
myself in the flames of passion''
''lt's difficult for
you to escape, lover''
''This heart of mine
is crazy about my lover''
''This heart of mine
is crazy about love''
Your aunt seems to have brought
a lot of your uncles downstairs.
Don!
Give yourself up to the police!
Before the police drag you away...
and before you are hanged for the
people you have killed...
l must tell you that
l came here with you,...
and allowed your dirty hands
to fondle my body...
only because l wanted to avenge
the death of my fiance, Ramesh.
Ramesh? Who's that?
Smart man, aren't you?
The police have found your
Fingerprints in the cab.
Don! This is the last warning!
So you are Ramesh's fiancee.
No one will open fire...
l want Don alive.
That's an empty revolver, Don.
Let's go, Don.
The police are waiting for you.
Never mind. The cops in eleven
countries are waiting for me.
But let me tell you
something, Sonia.
lt's not just difficult to nab Don.
lt's impossible.
You mean you can escape?
- Of course.
You know the revolver is not loaded.
So do l.
But the cops don't know that.
You have been surrounded, Don.
This is the last warning.
An attempt to escape
will be futile.
Just give yourself up
to the police.
You can't escape.
Will l have to tell you that
if you try to stop me...
this girl dies?
Be a wise man, Don.
Surrender.
lt's a predicament, D.S.P.
l'm not in the habit
of being arrested.
lt isn't in the girl's interests
for you to advance towards me.
The police found this wallet and
air-tickets on the corpse in the taxi.
The tickets were in the names
of Ramesh and Kamini.
These are the clothes
they found on the body.
Where did they find Kamini's body?
- At Ghodbunder Road.
Her hands were tied. She seemed to
have been pushed out of a running car.
Having seen this, l'm sure
my brother and his fiancee are dead.
Here's some money, doctor.
Please have their bodies cremated
after the post-mortem.
Was this man your brother?
Don't you want to see his face
one last time?
No, doctor.
What will l gain from it?
l have just to see to the man
who killed my brother.
You?!
You want to learn Karate and Judo?
- Yes. l will learn it.
l see.
But what makes a beautiful girl like
you interested in judo and karate?
Whom are you out to kill?
The one who killed my brother.
lt isn't for a delicate darling
like you to learn judo and karate.
This gorgeous body
is meant to be loved.
Take my suggestion...
Good! You have passed
the first test.
Judo and Karate helps those
who are determined to fight back.
l wanted to see
just how courageous you are.
Will you...?
- l will teach you everything.
That's the first lesson.
Never offer your hand to
someone carelessly. Okay?
We have a warrant
in your name, Miss Roma.
ln my name?
- Yes. We've been looking for you.
What have l done?
- You are accused of murder.
You must accompany me
to the police station.
Murder? ... Murder!
Give that pistol to me!
You can't escape!
Till l have accomplished my goal,
the police can do nothing to me!
Now look; Let me tell you...
You need not look behind.
Just start the engine
and begin driving.
l want to get out of here.
Consider us to be your friends, lady.
We can help you.
There are cops ahead.
Get down that seat.
This isn't a joke, is it?
What use is this girl for us?
You wouldn't have said that had you
seen her shoot at the cops, Vikram.
Even a cat leaps at you
when it's trapped.
l could flatten out
ten girls like her...
This girl is dangerous and deadly.
She's a wild cat.
And l'm fond of wild cats.
You will work with us.
Have you been paid?
No one must know of
the drama we played.
Should anyone squeal...
l will not use fake bullets nor
will you shed ketchup for blood.
We might be actors, sir.
But we do have a conscience.
All right. You may go now.
You have passed the second test.
An ace... a king and a queen.
My turn to deal?
Sheikh hasn't called yet, Don.
- He will. Don't worry.
You take everything so lightly.
Tarchand here.
l've received word.
He'll be at Silver Beach by 1 1 .30.
1 1 .30 sharp.
1 1 .30 ? All right.
Don will be there.
What diary is this?
- lt's very useful for us.
lt contains the names and
addresses of our contacts...
in every big city of the world.
Don't even dream of escaping.
We have every gun
pointed at you.
l'm carrying a lot of money
in this briefcase.
l can pay for my escape.
Raise your hand
and start walking!
You mustn't have seen the kind of
money l'm carrying in this, D.S.P.
Take a look...
you might change your mind.
Take a look here, Constable...
and you go there.
We have men posted even on the
other side of the hill, sir.
lt's impossible for him to escape
if he is indeed somewhere around.
l've got to go to the Headquarters.
Continue with the search operation.
Keep driving...
Don? How did you get here?
You forget. Even if l'm injured...
l'm still the Don.
lt's not just difficult to nab Don...
it's impossible.
You're badly wounded Don.
There's only one way
you can live.
Surrender to me.
l'll take you to the hospital.
Keep driving.
The place is swarming with cops.
l want to get out of here.
Listen to me, Don.
You can't escape in that condition.
Just keep driving, okay?
l'm sitting right behind you.
The nozzle is aimed at your brains.
Any nonsense from you
and l'll squeeze the trigger.
Just keep driving...
You will keep this a secret.
All right, lnspector.
l'll do it for you.
Can you tell us why Don wasn't
arrested despite being shot?
Could he have drowned?
- Why was the police withdrawn?
Couldn't he be hiding
someplace out there?
Neither has he drowned,
nor is he hiding there.
What makes you say that?
- l saw him swimming across the creek.
Did you? And why didn't
you try to stop him?
The police admit that Don
has slipped out of their hands.
But the police have
not lost hope.
We are sure we will
arrest him some day.
Have you read the news?
- Yes.
According to the police,
Don was seriously injured.
He could've drowned in the
very lake he took a plunge in.
The police mustn't have
found his body. And so...
No, Uncle Dayal.
That can't be true.
The D.S.P. has himself
seen Don escape.
He mustn't die of drowning or
be felled by police bullets.
What enmity is this that
you want him to live?
Yes, l want him to live.
Because he has to die at my hands.
Remember what happened
about six months ago?
There was this man who barged into
my cabin with these two children?
The simpleton? The kids had
lost their mother...
and the father had disappeared.
This chap had found
the children somewhere.
lt had to do with
something like this.
And l had called you to
register a complaint.
Yes, there was something.
May l go through the report again?
Bring the file to me.
That's all right.
You may go.

That's another rupee!
That Shambhu is a bloody shirker.
He doesn't play any other beat.
l've told him so often that l want
a faster beat. But he won't listen.
l'm sick of this cymbal.
How much have we made today, dear?
- 1 1 Rupees and 75 paise.
Damn it! l sing myself hoarse
and all l get is Rupees 1 1 .75!
Now what are we going to do
with this much of money?
C'mon, uncle! We'll not only eat,
but even pay the rent for the hut.
l'm not worried about that.
lt's worrying for you kids
that gnaws at my heart.
What will l have to do to get you
an admission into a school?
The two of you are my
responsibility, you see.
Or else... what do you
call your old man?
when your dad meets me,...
he'll say l've brought
his children on the streets.
Our dad would be
very happy to meet you.
But naturally. He has to
be happy. And why not?
But as l said,
should he...
But, sir... why are you
telling me that Don is dead?
You haven't even told the police
department... why tell me?
lt was necessary to tell you...
- Necessary to tell me?!
l'm only a street performer, sir.
How am l connected with this?
There is a connection.
A very strange one.
Look at this.
lt's the Don's photograph.
ls this Don?
lt's me.
- lt's Don.
ln which case, you don't
want to plant me... do you?
Yes. You will be
giving us great help.
No, sir... not me.
You just told me that they've
bumped off three of your informers.
So what if we look alike?
They'll immediately discover...
Now hold this for a moment.
Let me explain.
There is this Don, who opened
fire at the drop of a hat.
And look at me!
l haven't even played with marbles!
l'll teach you everything.
- That's hardly going to help!
His gang will know l'm...
- They won't get to know anything!
You and l are the only ones who
know the secret of Don's death.
And that you are not Don,
you are somebody else...
will be a secret
known only to me.
Like his gang, even the police
will think you're Don.
l see...
but what happens when the cops
catch me, taking me to be Don?
Won't l land in trouble?
- l'll take care of that!
l'll tell my men that you're
not Don. You're my man; an informer.
That's all okay. But...
you'd rather spare me.
This is terribly dangerous.
What kind of a man are you?
You're shy away from a little danger!
l didn't earlier. lt was
different then. l was all alone.
l'd have agreed to it then...
so what if l had died.
But now...
l'm no longer alone,
you know.
l have Deepu and Munni
to look after.
And suppose l take the plunge into it
because you ask me to...
and those guys discover l'm
an imposter... they'll kill me.
And what happens of the kids then?
They'll be back on the streets.
You seem to have fallen
in love with the children.
Yes, sir. That's true.
They have no one but me.
They love me so very much.
But what are you giving them in
return for their innocent love?
A life of streets performers?
Of vagabonds?
They can go to school, if you wish.
And learn to be doctors or engineers.
How will that be?
- l'll give them everything they need.
l'll send them to a nice hostel.
They'll go to a nice school if l...
That is... if l pull this thing
off for you, right?
l have no personal enmity
against Don or his gang.
But their crime is as big a cancer
on society as these kids' poverty.
Help me wipe out their crimes...
and l will help you put
an end to the kids' misery.
Do you agree?
All right... okay.
ln exchange for your favor, Vijay...
l take responsibility for the
children's education.
l will also try and trace
their father and find who it is.
Why're you always
so worried, Daljit?
lt's only a matter of a month.
You're bound to find
your children once you're out.
But how did all this happen?
Man gives up crime, Kaka.
But his notoriety always stalks him.
l had totally cut off myself
from my old life.
But the world
couldn't forgive me.
C'mon... get in.
No thanks, Narang.
l go a different path.
Which is why you walk
your way.
Well? Can't we share a ride even
if we're going different ways?
Come... l'll drop you home.
l have an assignment for you.
On the 1st of every month,...
a van leaves Ratanlal Mills
with salaries for its workers.
The amount is over
a million rupees.
There are guards
around the van...
and it takes half an hour
to reach the mill.
We can make you get into the van.
What reminds you of me
for such a noble task?
You have so many other men.
The money lies in a safe
in the van.
Who, other than you, can break
open the safe in just 30 minutes?
You're a sensible man.
Stop the car, driver.
You haven't given me an answer.
Our tread different paths.
l told you.
Don't be stupid!
What do you get from that
silly job in the circus anyway?
l'll pay you 150,000
for a single job.
You stand no chance!
l'm happy being a poor man, Narang.
Thanks for the lift.
Let's go, driver.
Daddy...
- Why are you crying?
They've taken mom to the hospital.
- The hospital?
Yes. Mom fainted and the neighbors
rushed her to the hospital.
Don't worry.
Mom's going to be all right.
Wait here... l'll be
back from the hospital.
Your wife is in danger.
We must conduct the
operation immediately.
We will have to call in
a doctor from abroad.
lt'll cost a lot of money...
- Don't worry about the money, doctor.
Save my wife, please!
l'll raise the money.
l'll be back soon.
Forget the money.
You're not even employed anymore.
What are you saying, sir?
- Just what you've heard.
l've decided to give
you the sack.
You need not report
for work tomorrow.
But what for?
- l don't have to answer you.
You may go.
Scoundrel!
l feel like crushing you!
But l don't want
to dirty my hands.
Remember this. lf he gets to know
that we're behind the sacking...
this bullet will
give you a third eye.
This is the route the van
from Ratanlal Mills takes.
At the rail-crossing here,
you must enter into the van.
How will l get in?
That has been arranged
at the van's workshop.
All you must do is to
undo a couple of screws.
One moment...
You forgot your cigarette case
in the van. Remember this?
Search him.
Give me any punishment
you wish, D.S.P.
But let me have
this money now.
lt can give my wife
a new lease of life.
You have stolen that money!
l'm willing to pay
for my crime, D.S.P.
For God's sake!
My wife will...
l can't help you.
Take him away.
Stop there, or l'll open fire!
Having suffered that bullet injury,
l, who walked the tight rope once...
couldn't even walk
on the ground properly.
My wife died. My children
were separated from me.
And it all happened
because of the D.S.P.
l'm not going to spare him...
l'll kill him!
Uncle!
Here you are...
my Deepu and Munni!
See our uniform, uncle?
- Fantastic!
Know what? l didn't
recognize you.
l thought it was
a gentleman and a lady.
But then l found it
was the two of you.
Fooled me properly, didn't you?
lt's a very nice school, uncle.
The teachers and the hostel
is good too.
That's it. You must study hard.
With God's blessings, Deepu will
grow up to be a magistrate.
And you will make a very nice
good officer too.
Hey! How could l forget!
l've got some roasted grams for you.
Here you are.
We don't get any grams here.
They give us only pudding.
That's exactly why l brought this
for you. Eat it... go on.
So you have kept
your promise, Mr. D.S.P.
lt's my turn now. What will l
have to do? l'm ready to start.
You aren't ready yet.
You'll be ready only after
you have been trained.
Study every mannerism...
his gait, his way
of looking at people.
Whatever you have shown me
about this character,...
has been very sketchy.
l mean, it's too little.
For example, l don't know the
names of his colleagues in the gang.
l know nothing of his habits.
The way he conducted himself...
his way of behaving with people,
his likes and dislikes.
You get what l say,
don't you?
l know l haven't told you
much about Don, but...
when Don reaches his gang,
he'll be badly wounded.
He'll have lost his memory.
Do you understand?
All right. l do.
You will gradually
regain your memory...
as and when you discover
things about Don. Okay?
May l say something, sir?
You ask me if l understand
every little thing.
Do you take me to
be an idiot?
Why won't l understand?
No... Don never
chewed betel-leaf.
Didn't he?
And why not?
That wasn't a good thing he did.
l'll have to give it up.
Or else, they'll...
That reminds me...
how will l get there?
l have an idea.
- You do, don't you?
l wouldn't want to...
you know?
Who's that? Speak up...
l can't hear you.
Mr. Varma... l can tell you
where Don is hiding.
Let's not talk
about my identity.
Just let me tell you
where Don is holed up.
Looks like we have found Don.
An anonymous caller told us
about Don's whereabouts.
So what are we waiting for?
Let's go.
Mr. Malik! Mr. D.S.P.
The doctors say Don has
lost his memory.
He remembers nothing
about his past.
We must rescue Don from
the police at any cost.
But the hospital is
swarming with policemen.
ln my opinion,
Don can be freed...
when the police shift him
to the jail from the hospital.
D'you think there will be
a single police officer...
escorting Don from
the hospital to the jail?
Since they are guarding
the hospital so closely...
imagine what they will
do on the way to the jail.
So what do we do?
We'll have to rescue Don
from the hospital.
May l go in?
l've got to give the
patient a sponge-bath...
check his temperature
and his Blood Pressure.
All right.
Go on.
Could you go out for a while?
- Why must l go out?
l've got to give the patient a
sponge-bath and change his clothes.
lt'll take just 5 minutes.
- Okay. Hurry up.
Where has he gone?
- There... out of the window.
C'mon!
What is it, lnspector?
l've been asked not to allow any
vehicle without a checking.
What's in the van?
- A dead body
May l see his face, sister?
l don't mean to criticize the
police department, Mr. Varma.
But you didn't make proper arrangement
for Don's security at the hospital.
There's nothing l can say
to you in this regard, Mr. Malik.
The arrangements were left to
the D.S.P., who is my senior.
l understand your position.
But there's no doubt now that
he has been very careless.
ln any case,
Don has lost his memory.
He's of no use to us,
nor to his gang...
Maybe you haven't studied
the medical report thoroughly.
The doctors opine that if the patient
were to be taken into the past...
and old incidents played again,...
he can regain his memory.
You will recover.
You will remember everything.
You have always won
at the card-game, Don.
Remember the 3 aces you
showed me before you left?
Remember Tarachand
who called then?
Try and remember, Don!
You must certainly remember this
diary which you saw before you left.
lt has the names of our all contacts,
their addresses and telephone numbers.
You had personally
put it in the safe.
Does he recall anything?
lt's taking him time.
But he isn't normal yet.
He looks at everything as if
he were trying to recognize it.
But he's better now.
He recalls quite a few things.
And what are you waiting for?
l'm waiting for him
to recall everything.
When l kill him, he must know
what l'm punishing him for.
When l talk to him about Ramesh...
he ought to know who
l'm talking about.
lt's a matter of a few days.
l have feeling that he
will recover very soon.
l know so much about Don now...
that l can pretend to have
recovered of my memory.
But you must be careful.
They mustn't suspect anything.
That's what l was thinking about.
There was no reason for him
to lose his memory.
There has to be a reason
for him to recover it.
l'll create a situation for you
to recover your memory.
Stop your car at the petrol pump
when you're returning.
Fill the tank.
l'll be back in a minute.
Start the car, Mac.
Hands up...
You can't escape today.
Now quietly get into the
police jeep. Go on!
Turn right!
Stop here.
l get it...
l remember everything.
This is exactly
what happened that day.
l was speeding away in the car
and the cops were after me.
They were firing away and...
l remember it all!
You remember everything, Don?
- Everything!
l'm Don; you're Anita.
This is Narang, Ashok,...
Vikram, Mac...
l remember everything!
l'm all right now!
Do you remember
just your friends?
Do you remember your
business and enemies too?
Remember this man?
Ramesh.
This is the traitor
l killed.
Have you noticed, Mac?
- What?
Don is a changed man
after his recovery.
Nothing surprising. lt happens
after an accident of this kind.
What l mean to say is that...
l can't explain this.
Don isn't the
same old Don anymore.
He's the same man, Anita.
His girlfriend has changed.
You were his girlfriend earlier.
And now...
ln which case, the change
in him won't be forever.
That's because the girl isn't
going to be around for very long.
There's a message
from Mr. Kapadia, Don.
Now what does Mr. Kapadia want?
A thousand gold biscuits.
Will he take delivery here?
Or does he want it at his place?
Neither place. His man will meet you
at China Creek at 4 p.m. today.
How many of Kapadia's men are
we expecting to meet, Mr. Narang?
l forgot to ask.
You're right. lt isn't safe for you
to go there all alone, Don.
l want to accompany Don.
You want to be my bodyguard,
do you?
Roma knows how and when
to use her revolver.
Not just how and when.
l also know whom
to use it on.
''The moment l have waited for''
''The moment my heart
longed for...''
''is here now''
''l must cross all
limits of love today''
''l must either give you death today...

''The moment l have waited for...''
''The moment my heart

''l must cross all limits

''l must either give you death today
or l must die instead''
''How would you know

''You won't understand,
you're crazy''
''l will have my revenge

''l am here to quench

''You're a killer...

''You're a killer...
you can't escape''
''You will get from me just what
you have given unto me''
''The moment has arrived at last''
''l must pierce your heart''
''l must either give you death

''lt will be decided some day
whether your magic has worked or not''
''That moment

''We will see who gets to live

''Even if the world is

''and even if you're targeting

''be not so proud
of yourself''
''l'm good at hitting
the target, too''
''l could teach the old hands
how to play the game''
''l could lure the predator

''That moment will arrive;
it surely will''
''l've got to tell you
when the time comes...''
''as to who will get to live,
and who will die''
''We'll see who gets to live
and who dies''
Wait here. He's all alone.
l'll deal with him on my own.
l have eagerly
awaited this day, Don!
What kind of a joke is that?
l wanted to know if you'd be scared
to find a gun pointed at you.
So you've been putting
my courage to test, have you?
You weren't scared at all.
You're really a brave man.
Know what?
l was scared for a moment.
Let's go.
What's that?
Roma doesn't know she has left
with an empty pistol with Don.
But why did you do it?
That's because Don can save himself
from the police and other dangers.
As for Roma...
Give that to me.
l'll do it.
This is Vijay here.
l've got my hands on
a very important diary.
We know that Narang is not
the brains behind the gang.
Maybe the diary will tell us
who's masterminding their operations.
No one must get to know that
the diary has been replaced.
Before they discover that the
diary has been swapped...
l want to come over to your place
tomorrow and hand it over to you.
Don't be silly.
What if they suspect you?
Not a bad idea.
All right. l'll wait
for you tomorrow.
All our customers and agents are
expected any time next week, Don.
lt's after ages that we'll
get to meet old friends.
And l'm going to meet
a sworn enemy tomorrow.
One last time.
Who are you talking about?
The D.S.P.
He has attacked me twice.
He'll go to sleep tomorrow...
but he'll never awaken again.
Do you know that D'Silva lives on
the eighth floor of his building?
There are police guards
on the seventh floor.
They won't let you go up there.
l'm not going to go upstairs.
l'll take the route downwards.
That's terribly dangerous, Don.
And then...
l won't be at peace till l have
extracted revenge from the D.S.P.
lf you must extract
your revenge...
why not do it
tomorrow night?
You... what are you doing here?
l've been waiting for you, Don.
Hold it, Roma!
Have you gone mad?!
l went mad the day you
killed my brother Ramesh.
Was Ramesh your brother?
Yes. l wanted you to
know why you're dying.
Now listen to me, Roma...
Believe me!
l haven't killed your brother!
Don't cut that rope!
You're making a very
big mistake, Roma!
l'm not Don!
Hang on, Roma... don't cut the rope!
Listen to me...
Listen to me, Roma...
At least hear me out!
You're making a mistake!
l'm not the one
who killed your brother.
You're lying!
He's telling you the truth.
Let him go.
What a mistake l've been making!
Who could ever say that
he's not Don himself?
You're the only one who can
say that, apart from Vijay and me.
l've told you everything.
You thought he was an enemy.
But he isn't.
Like you, he's against those who are
responsible for your brother's death.
l'm terribly sorry, Vijay.
- Why be sorry?
Anyone in your shoes
would be taken in.
Not even the police
know my true identity.
Tell me something, sir.
- What is it?
Won't you have to tell the police
how you landed the diary,...
when you turn it in to them?
Till such time as we carry out
a big raid and nab all of them...
your assignment isn't over.
l don't want to take any risk.
So the diary remains with me.
l'm glad you could bring it to me.
lt could've got ruined
in the water.
l'll keep it in the safe.
l'm terribly sorry that l have...
- l'm the one who's sorry, Roma.
The truth is that l've been acting
with everyone in this drama.
But l was really drawn to you.
And when l got to know today
that you've been acting too...
l find such a distance
between us.
That's all right. You had once
bridged the distances...
and l will do it now.
Should the D.S.P. see us,
he'll lock me up with the diary.
Now tell me something.
l had to do all this because l wanted
to avenge my brother's death.
But what makes you get
into this dangerous game?
l have two reasons for
agreeing to this game.
Here you are, Roma.
My two reasons... Deepu and Munni.
This is Roma, children.
ls she your aunt too?
- Your aunt, maybe.
For me, she's...
All right. Go on, children.
Lovely kids.
Yes. l'm not related to them.
But they mean the world to me.
Everything l'm doing
is just for them.
l wonder where their parents are.
Their mother is no more.
As for their father,
l wonder where he is.
Let the gate remain open, guard.
l'm going to return very soon.
Not to walk out of this gate again.
This time, l'm going to
hang from the noose.
Throw that ball here, please!
Mr. D'Silva? This is Vijay here.
The gang's agents and customers
are coming here tonight.
The diary reveals that they're
working for a smuggler called Vardan.
But who is Vardan?
l couldn't figure out.
Let's hope Vardan attends the do
with the others tonight.
They'll be here by 8.30 tonight.
This is just what
l've been waiting for.
Ask Roma not to be
present there.
l don't want her
to take any risk.
Anything is likely to happen.
The police will raid
the place at 9 sharp.
Nine? Very well then.
l was right. You're not Don!
You're someone else...
an agent of the police!
l've heard everything! l will...
Mr. D.S.P.
Here is your revolver.
Recognize me?
Sure, l do.
D'you recognize this?
lt's the bullet
you had fired at me.
What do you want?
l want to kill you.
l hope you don't mind.
Give me that revolver, Daljit.
lt's important for me
to be someplace right now.
You can extract your revenge
some other time, if you must.
Let me go now.
How can l let you go, D.S.P. ?
My wife died because of you!
l was crippled because of you!
l wonder where Deepu and Munni are
begging right now... because of you!
Hold it!
Deepu and Munni?
Are they your children?
Why? Do you know
where they are?
Yes, l know where they are.
But you must first
return my revolver to me.
l'll tell you where your
children are, after l return.
Why must you tell me after you return?
Why don't you tell me right now?
Suppose you don't let me go
after you get to know?
And suppose you arrest me
once you have the revolver?
That's a distinct possibility.
But you will have to trust me.
You may go ahead and shoot me,
if you can't trust me.
But remember... l'm the only one
who knows your children's whereabouts.
Also remember that should
you choose to kill me...
you will have had your revenge.
But you won't see your
children ever again.
Think it over.
l don't hate you as much as
l love my children.
''Hey crazy guys...''
''recognize me''
''Where have l landed from?
Who am l?''
''Hey crazy guys''
''recognize me''
''Where have l come from?
And who am l?''
''Who am l...?''
''l'm the Don''
''Don! Don! Don!''
''l'm the Don...
l'm the Don''
''That which you have seen
and thought you knew...''
''is not the real me''
''That's not the real me''
''What you folks see me as...
is not the real me''
''Who has ever been to tell
about a cloud that drifts?''
''Hey crazy guys...''
''recognize me,
make the attempt''
''l'm the Don''
''l'm a friend to those
who are my friends''
''l could lay down my life
for my friends''
''That's the real me''
''That's the real me''
''l'm an enemy
for my foes...''
''l could knock them out cold''
''That's the real me...
the real me''
''l can't say if you know,
but l have realized...''
''what the guys out here are''
''Hey crazy guys...''
''recognize me...''
''l'm the Don''
''l'm the Don''
What's all this about?
What are you watching for, Vikram?
Go and help her.
Wait... let her be.
Have you then...?
But what for?
She's been talking
too bloody much.
But l know how to
silence such girls.
C'mon... this party has
no place for a girl like you!
l want to have a word
with Anita, Mr. Narang.
What for?
What's your problem?
l smell something fishy.
Don't anyone try to escape.
The police have surrounded
the building.
l'm going to search
the other rooms.
Take a look on either side.
Go on.
Where did those
gun-shots come from?
You expect us to believe
that you're not the Don!
My name is Vijay. l've been
an informer of the D.S.P.
He planted me in the gang as Don.
They're behind the bars
right now only because of me.
You're a smart man, Don.
But you can't con us this once.
Take him away!
- What kind of a joke is this?
You can't lock me up like this!
Why can't you summon the D.S.P. and
ask him, if you can't believe me?
He'll tell you the whole truth.
The D.S.P. was badly injured
in the shoot-out during the raid.
He's lying unconscious
in a hospital.
Unconscious? You can ask him
when he regains consciousness...
We will certainly ask him...
''if'' he regains consciousness.
''lf'' ?!
Please take me to
the D.S.P. immediately.
He's the only one who knows
that l'm not Don!
Should something happen to him,
l'll...
l want to meet the D.S.P.
Please!
There's no point in continuing
this conversation, Don.
You're making a mistake!
l'm not Don! l'm not!
Take me to the D.S.P.
- Hold it.
There's no reason why we
mustn't take him to the D.S.P.
Maybe...
- Maybe he's speaking the truth?
lsn't that what you want to say?
A police officer must never
dismiss anything as impossible.
Let's take him to
the hospital right now.
We'll soon know whether you've
been lying or speaking the truth.
Let's go.
He's speaking the truth.
That bastard isn't Don.
Mr. D.S.P...
lt's me... Vijay.
You recognize me, don't you?
They're mistaking me for Don.
But l'm not Don, am l?
l've done it all
only for you.
l did it for Deepu and Munni...
but they don't believe me.
Didn't you have the children
admitted in St. Terera's school...
so l'd do this job for you?
Please explain it to them.
l'm Vijay, you know.
And you know l'm Vijay...
Mr. D.S.P. ?
Doctor...
Doctor...?
He can't do anything for you now.
Let's go.
Sir...!
- What is it?
l have further proof, sir!
l gave the D.S.P. a diary
l stole from Narang.
He had kept that diary
in his safe.
As Don, how would l know that the
red diary is in the D.S.P.'s safe?
Am l right?
What he says is right, Mr. Varma.
- You don't expect me to...
lf that red diary is indeed
in the safe...
it'll prove that this man
is speaking the truth.
This chap is Don himself!
He's only wasting our time!
We ought to head for the
police station now. Please!
As a responsible officer
of the lnterpol...
l have followed Don
to this country.
l want to make sure that
everything is absolutely clear.
So why not look at
the D.S.P.'s safe, too?
Whoever you are...
this is your last chance.
l know that Mr. Malik.
How could this happen?!
How did... all this happen?
l'm telling you the truth, sir!
That diary was lying in this safe!
You don't believe me, do you?
l've given you every
opportunity, Don.
But you can't deny anymore
that you are Don himself.
Mr. Malik... l am not Don!
There's something more! A report
l had filed with the police!
You stand exposed, Don!
None of our files contain any
such report that you mention!
How can that be, sir?
l had indeed filed a report...
Take Don to his friends' cell.
lf you must lock me up,
don't throw me in with them!
Whether you believe me or not...
they've got to know l'm not Don!
ldiots! Kill him and the police
will know that he's not Don.
l don't want that to happen...
Go away.
Smart cookie, aren't you?
But you're in a jam now.
The police think
you're Don...
and we know for sure
that you're not him.
Don will be sentenced
to death by the courts.
lf that doesn't happen, we can
always bump off Vijay in jail.
l don't think it's safe to keep
these dangerous criminals here.
We ought to shift them
to the prison tonight.
Use that stare on
someone else, baldie!
l could straighten you out
with a nice bashing!
Sit properly, or
l'll punch your mug!
He's trying to provoke you
into a fight!
So the police will keep him
in a different cell.
Oh, let him be! You need to be
man enough to put up a fight.
Not this rat, no sir!
l've somehow managed to escape.
But l don't know what
l am now supposed to do.
Apart from the D.S.P.,...
it is only the diary which
can prove my innocence.
And it's impossible
to find it now.
We will find it.
Anyone who stole the diary isn't
going to hand it over to the police.
He's bound to try and sell it
to Narang or his agents.
You're right... but Narang and
his men don't suspect you, do they?
Keep in touch with them.
And let me know as soon as you
have some information.
Where will you meet me?
At Mahalaxmi Station,
exactly a week from today.
Only that diary can
save me now, Roma.
This is a mere diary.
lt's a check-book from
the Bank of Smugglers!
What does it say?
lt says that l will soon
be a millionaire.
This diary contains the
names and addresses...
of Narang and every other member
of his syndicate.
This envelope here has a letter
for the police from the D.S.P.
lt conveys the news of
Don's death. lt also says...
that the D.S.P. sent someone
called Vijay to impersonate Don.
Narang will pay me any price
to have this diary back!
Who is it?
- The police. Open the door!
lt's already open, my friend.
C'mon in.
Did someone come here?
- Yes.
You are here.
And so is he.
l'm talking about a tall man
who came running this way.
Sorry, lnspector. No one came here.
- All right. Let's go.
They've left.
You may come out.
Not that door. The cops
are waiting for you.
Take the rear exit.
May l know why you didn't
hand me to the police?
l have a reason. l'm a cripple
and l live all alone.
Besides, l have known the cops
for a very long time.
l've been waiting for you.
- l can't help it.
The police seem to be
everywhere l go.
l'd have met you long ago.
But then...
l have a suggestion.
Why don't you...?
Who are you, mister?
Who are you?
And what do you want?
How do l say? l'm from
your part of the country.
l'm looking for shelter.
- That's fantastic, mister!
You dress up like the city-bred...
but speak a language that comes
from the natives of the Ganges.
Welcome...! Do come.
Please sit down. Go on.
Try some opiate.
lt's in the name of the Lord.
Gulp it down in the
name of Lord Shiva.
Go on... have another!
Stop it, Vijay.
Aren't we leaving?
Oh sit down, lady...
Where will l go anyway?
l have neither home
nor the world to live in!
That was great of you, D.S.P.
Swell arrangements you
have made for me!
What's the good word?
- What is it?
How would l know?
Suffice it to say then that l suffer
for what those who are dead, did.
l had a strong feeling not to
get into this godamned thing.
lt's a dangerous game.
But he asked me to
take the plunge!
And there l was...
l must suffer now.
Don't use those dark,
seductive eyes...
to stare at me, oh lady.
Your eyes are like sharp knives...
don't you pierce my heart with them.
Have some betel-leaf
before you leave, mister.
What was that?
- A betel-leaf.
A betel-leaf?
- Yes!
Well, give it to me.
lt could knock you out of
your senses, just you see!
lt's a betel-leaf from Benaras.
- Let me have it...
That's wonderful! lt's ages
since l've chewed betel-leaf.
Let's go, Vijay.
Just you wait, lady.
After the betel-leaf comes
a song... what say, guys?
''With opiate ruling your senses...''
''chew a betel-leaf''
''lt could stir your heart...''
''and make you feel
you were born again''
''A betel-leaf from Benaras...''
''A betel-leaf from Benaras
opens up the mind''
''A betel-leaf from Benaras
opens up the mind''
''Such wonders will l work then
that l'll straighten out everyone''
''For l'm the lad from
the banks of the Ganges''
''For l'm the lady from
the banks of the Ganges''
''A betel-leaf from Benaras
opens up the mind''
''My God! What a mess
l've landed in''
''l've landed my life
in trouble...''
''l might as well get the noose''
''l was such a simpleton''
''l was so naive''
''l was such a simpleton;
l used to be so naive...''
''l rue the day l had anything
to do with the educated''
''l was slaughtered
in good faith''
''l'm the lad from
the banks of the Ganges''
''A betel-leaf from Benaras
opens the mind''
''Join us, lady!''
''This maiden so sweet...
has fallen for my face''
''She's like a sharp knife...
she's made a place in my heart''
''She's so fair-skinned
and so very seductive''
''She's so fair-skinned
and so very seductive''
''She has stolen my heart''
''l have been fulfilled
ever since l have met her''
''For l come from the
banks of the river Ganges''
''A betel-leaf from Benaras
opens up the mind''
''A betel-leaf from Benaras
opens up the mind''
''l work wonders then
and straighten them out''

banks of the river Ganges''
This is Vijay here, Mr. Malik.
The Vijay you think is Don.
Whoever you are,
l have a suggestion for you.
Surrender to the law.
l certainly will. But l want
you to give me some time...
l can give you proof
of my innocence.
l let you have all the opportunities
l could. What else can l do?
l want to meet you, Mr. Malik.
Meet me?
- Yes, sir.
l'm sure we can
help each other.
Yes... all right.
l'll be there at 1 1 'o clock.
l've been waiting here
for half an hour.
l know how l got here.
There are cops all around.
What do you want me to do?
l don't know why, but l have
a feeling that you can help me.
The police are hounding me...
and l've been running away
from them like a wild beast.
lf you could get them to
give me another opportunity...
l can prove my innocence and also
prove that l'm Vijay and not the Don!
You don't need to prove anything.
You're Vijay, l know that.
What? Do you know that?
Yes. l knew Don very well.
And so l know that you're not Don.
Why didn't you tell the police
when you knew all that?
l'll tell you the reason.
What reason could
there be, Mr. Malik?
Mr. Malik!
We have been surrounded!
Not l, Vijay.
You have been surrounded.
What?!
- That's right.
Just as you are not Don,
l'm not Malik either.
They're my men.
You had slipped out
of my hands...
but destiny has returned you
to me on a silver platter.
One moment... May l have a betel-leaf?
- Sure. Go ahead.
You don't chew betel-leaf.
Neither did Don. That wasn't right.
What are you doing?!
Can't you see how hard l'm trying?
l seem to have fallen!
The name is Vijay...
l'm no pushover!
C'mon...
Never mind if he's run away.
We'll deal with him later.
He's got to know that you're
not the police, Mr. Vardan...
And he might tell the police.
lsn't it?
And who will believe him?
Don't worry, guys.
Just leave it to me.
You act as if nothing
has happened, Mr. Vardan.
Had there been anybody else
in your shoes, he'd have...
he'd have panicked, isn't it?
That's just why there
isn't anyone like me.
''lnspector Varma, that man who claims
to be R.K. Malik from lnterpol...''
''is, in fact, a dangerous
international smuggler...''
''and is a mole for the smugglers
in the police force''
Do you know, it's a serious crime
to abduct an officer from lnterpol?
Should you be told of our
entire list of crimes, Mr. Malik...
you'll find this crime
to be kid-stuff.
ln any case, the world's
biggest smuggler, Vardhan...
has ably taken over
your duties.
You need not worry about all that.
But should you have any problems
here, you may summon me.
Mr. Varma? When did you arrive?
Just now... there's something l have
to discuss with you, Mr. Malik.
Really?
But there's something l'd like
to discuss with you first.
Go on.
l received an anonymous letter
yesterday. lt was about you.
The writer claims that you are
hand-in-glove with the criminals...
who work in Don's syndicate.
He says that you're an agent of the
criminals in policeman's guise... etc.
l wonder who has played
this joke on us.
You had something to say...
didn't you?
l...? lt's rather
strange, Mr. Malik.
This is just what l wanted to
discuss with you.
l've received a letter
about you too.
Really? Let me see it.
This is fantastic!
Don't you still understand?
Today is April 1 ...
We're the Fools!
Please sit down.
l'll be back in a minute.
Sorry to be barging
in like this, baldie.
l know you hate to meet people
in the evening.
But l'll take just
10 minutes of your time.
The first five minutes,
l will bash you up.
And you will answer my questions
in the other five.
You had better answer my questions
about Vardhan. Or else...
l know it for a fact that
when the den was raided...
you and your friends were present
in the room where the D.S.P was shot.
You have killed
the D.S.P., Shakaal.
l will have no hesitation
in killing you
No... l'll explain!
lt wasn't l who
killed the D.S.P.
lt was Vardhan himself.
Yes!
- How did it happen?
l didn't get to know that
the police had raided our den...
l was having a drink
with my friends.
Vardhan suddenly
arrived there.
The police has raided the place
and you're enjoying yourselves!
Yes! Now just get the
hell out of here. Go on!
There's no way
they can get out of here.
D.S.P.? You?
- l've heard everything.
You've been fooling the police in
the garb of an officer from lnterpol.
Your game is up, Mr. Vardhan!
Vardhan doesn't play games
that get over, D.S.P.
They've killed the D.S.P.!
Arrest them!
You will have to say this
to the police.
l want all the evidence
against Vardhan.
Don't try to run away, Shakaal...
Don't!
And so you've squealed
on the D.S.P.'s murder?
l had no other way.
He seemed to have gone mad.
Had l not told him...
he was bound to kill me.
And you didn't want to die,
isn't it?
Anyway, that is now in the past.
Should Vijay get to be
a threat for us...
l have something to
stop him.
Remember the two children Vijay spoke
about at the police station?
The kids the D.S.P. had
admitted in the hostel?
l want those kids.
- How will they help?
Maybe not today. But the kids can be
used against Vijay in the future.
Send someone and have
the kids picked up.
Are you Uncle Vijay's friend?
- Yes. C'mon... he has called you.
Jasjit is here.
- Jasjit?
Yes. He claims to have the diary.
- He has it?
Whoever he is...
show him in.
Long time no see!
How are you?
You see me limping...
and yet ask me how l am.
The deal l struck with you proved to be
pretty expensive for me, Mr. Narang.
l'm sorry about that, J.J.
- That's all right.
But this deal will prove
to be expensive for you.
That's how the tables turn.
- Let's talk business.
Do you have the diary?
- You're a strange man, Mr. Vardhan.
You want me to talk business
and ask me silly questions.
Am l mad to be here,
if l didn't have the diary?
How did you get to know
my name and this address?
That's another foolish question.
l have the diary which
has every name and address.
How much money do you want?
- Now, that's a sensible question.
You know very well that should the
police get their hands on the diary...
all your businesses
will be shut down.
Name the price.
- l'm not a very greedy man, you know.
But l would settle
for a million rupees.
A million?
- ls that too little?
Listen lame duck! Nobody blackmails us
and gets away with it!
Are you out of your mind?
lf he dies, so do all of us!
We must get back that diary...
at any cost!
All right. But this rascal here...
- Roma is right.
She's a sensible girl.
- All right.
Bring the diary to us and
you will get a million.
You are a sensible man too.
But l will tell you how and when
l will take that million.
And it's l who will decide
who l will give the diary to.
Whom will you give it to?
This girl will come to a place
l decide, with a million rupees.
She must come all alone.
And l will give the diary to her.
Why the girl?
- Because she appears to be sensible.
l'd hate to see a devil coming along
to claim the diary.
Devils, who are fond
of using noisy guns.
Keep that.
All right. But which place?
Give this girl a million Rupees
in a briefcase. And...
Mr. Varma is here, Mr. Vardhan!
Get out of here, all of you!
Go on! l'll call you later.
Welcome, Mr. Varma.
Where have you been?
Where did you go?!
How did you get here?
Who brought you here?
l must leave now.
- Very well. Bye.
Don't tell anyone that
l'm your daddy.
l'll take you away tonight. Okay?
- Very well, daddy.
Go on. Go to your places.
Come on.
Whose kids are they? Vardhan's?
- Mind your own business. Okay?
Stop screaming... the diary makes
a mention of a guy with a beard too.
But they're cute kids...
no, they can't be Vardhan's children.
Let's go.
Could you find out where
they've hidden Deepu and Munni?
l know where they are.
- Do you?
So tell me.
l'll go and bring them tonight.
Your turn...
drop a card.
Where could Shakaal be?
Open the door, J.J. !
What's going to happen now?
- Don't worry. Just wait here.
Open the door!
Open the door, l say!
Stay here.
Don't go away till l return.
How about you, dad?
- Don't worry about me.
l'll go and fix the man
who's been following us.
Had there been anyone else
in your place...
You have once saved me
from the police.
l don't want to fight with you.
Just hand over the kids to me.
l did save you from
the police.
But l doubt if l will spare you
if you talk of the children again.
Go away!
Where are the children?
On the other side of the lane.
And you will not cross this lane
till l'm here.
Uncle Vijay!
That's Uncle Vijay, dad!
He looked after us in your absence.
He's a nice man!
This is our daddy, Uncle Vijay.
Forgive me, Vijay.
l thought you were their enemy.
That's okay.
Both of us have made a mistake.
You have been my children's support.
What can l do for you?
No one can help me.
l'm trapped in a mess.
Why were the police chasing you
the other day?
Now what will l tell you?
lt's just that they think...
l must leave now.
So long!
Have you seen someone around?
Sure, l have. l see you.
l see the guy in the jeep.
Let's go.
This bag contains a million Rupees.
You will give this briefcase to J.J.,
only after you receive the diary.
And you will bring the diary
straightaway to me.
Where will l find J.J. ?
l received a call from
J.J. just now.
He will wait for you
at a cemetery near Malad.
Here you are.
Wait... ls it okay for her
to go alone, Mr. Vardhan?
l have all the faith in Roma.
Right, Roma?
Listen...
Follow her and keep an eye on her.
The moment you have the diary...
finish J.J. and the girl.
Have you brought the money?
Yes.
Set the briefcase on the
second grave to your right.
Where is the diary?
- Keep the briefcase there.
Now walk towards me...
you will find the diary on the grave
where the wreath is placed.
l was the one to arrive first.
But you will leave before me.
Out of that gate.
Why go anywhere?
This graveyard has enough place
for the two of you.
You think you're very smart,
don't you?
Now baby... give that diary to uncle.
That isn't meant for kids.
l'll deal with J.J. later.
l'll fix you first.
We won't have to
put in much of hard work.
There's a grave already
waiting for you.
Vikram, keep an eye on J.J.
There's a saying, old man Narang.
Those who dig graves for others
end up in the same pits!
Do you get that?
Yes! C'mon!
Wherever you are...
you can very well see that
l hold the trump card!
lt would be in your interests
to come on out.
Leave my children alone!
l'm coming to you.
Vijay! These are the children
for whom you turned Don.
Won't you walk a couple
of feet for them today?
... or else, J.J.'s innocent kids
will die because of you.
Roma! Maybe you're not interested
in the children's lives...
but you will surely
mourn Vijay's death.
So step out!
The poor guy's waiting for you.
Strange thing, this love is.
Be it for children, or...
Listen to my last wish
before you die.
l want that diary. Where is it?
Could you tell me, Roma darling?
lt's not with me.
Very well. But l will ''check'' you
thoroughly, if l don't find it.
Now look, Vijay.
You mustn't be stubborn.
Give me that diary.
l don't have the diary, mister.
ln which case, J.J. should have it.
Well, J.J. ?
This is a problem.
Here's what you will do, Narang.
Bury these kids alive.
Vardhan! Scoundrel!
This is no time for jokes, J.J.
Wait... l have the diary.
And here's the D.S.P.'s letter
My court now decides that
the three of you are guilty.
l now pronounce a common sentence...
a death sentence.
No one moves!
Except me, that is.
- Mr. Malik?
Yes, it's me. l have, at last,
nabbed the culprit, Mr. Varma.
This man is not Malik, lnspector!
Wonderful! l'm not Malik.
And he's not Don.
This is no time for nonsense,
lnspector Varma. Just arrest them!
Do you have any proof to
back your claim, lady?
l did have the proof, lnspector.
But this rascal has burnt it!
Which means she has no proof.
See that, lnspector Varma?
lnspector Varma has
seen it, all right.
But, Mr. Vardhan...
you didn't check whether the
diary you threw in the fire...
was the real one
or a fake.
Here's the real diary.
And here is the D.S.P.'s letter.
l didn't show you the
real diary.
Here you are.
You must forgive me, Mr. Vardhan.
But you have been outwitted today.
C'mon... get out of that place!
l don't want to bury you alive.
This graveyard is
meant for human-beings...
not for monsters like you!
C'mon out!
A stick can't get him out, lnspector.
Help yourself.
