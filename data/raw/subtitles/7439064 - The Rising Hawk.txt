It's your turn.
Shut up!
Shut up!
He was already dead when we arrived.
Sorry,
my Khan.
Leave me.
We know that it's safest
for us to head west,
following this path,
or this path.
We can't re-supply or
call reinforcements.
The mountains will be very difficult
for us to cross.
However,
if we follow the valley,
we won't encounter any resistance.
We believe that the amulet
is with someone
in one of the mountain villages.
We will head...
... Over the mountains.
- Merke.
- Yes, my Khan.
Gather your men.
Search every village.
Find the ones responsible.
Tugar Volk...
Get my special arrows.
After them! Kill them all!
Go!
Take the archers.
Bring the heads of those assassins.
Yes, my Khan.
Follow me!
We have killed most, my Khan.
And the two brothers?
I'll bring my whole army to the
top of the Carpathian Mountains.
I'll raze everything to the ground.
You'll lead the way.
And maybe I'll spare your miserable life.
Tear those assassins apart!
Retreat!
My Khan!
Every villager fights
with the strength of ten.
We must change our plan and
withdraw from the mountain.
Idiot.
Take charge.
I want to destroy
that village before dark.
I'll find your loved ones
and you'll watch me
slaughter them like cattle.
This way,
you and I will share the same pain.
Merke,
burn it all!
Take my guard
and ride ahead.
See how many villagers are left.
Don't let the villagers topple the rock.
Kill them!
Kill them!
Water! Run!
Wait!
Look.
