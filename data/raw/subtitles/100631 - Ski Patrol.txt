Cramer, Snowy Peaks isn't big
enough for the both of us.
Then I guess we'll just have
to deflate your head, Lance.
Ready,
set,
go.
We'll meet again, Cramer.
Oh, gee, I can't wait. It's such a
pleasure skiing with you, Lance.
Hi. Give you a push, ma'am?
Oh, would you?
Sure.
Thanks.
Come on, Dumpster.
Come on. That's it.
Okay!
Oh, look at you. Come on.
Hey, Jerry.
Hey! Come on, let's go.
We'll go over there. Come on.
Welcome back.
Santa. Girls.
How's business?
I hate snow.
Maris, I hope you didn't ask me down
here to talk about the weather.
No, I asked you down here to
talk about money, my friend.
What kind of money do you
make at Snowy Peaks?
$200 a pop for privates.
How would you like to make
10 times that amount?
Maybe more. Here's a preview.
Maristown!
My friend...
What do you want to do?
...I've got such plans
for this valley.
Just another ski lodge?
No, no, no. That's penny ante.
That's dime a dozen. This is
a major destination resort.
This could be the biggest money-making
machine of all time if...
If what?
If Snowy Peaks is mine!
I'd love to dream with you,
pal, but I got an 11:00.
Are you saying you're perfectly
happy with Snowy Peaks?
There's nothing about it
you would change?
Not the ski patrol?
Not Jerry Cramer?
What's he got to do with this?
Well...
Everybody knows you two just
don't get along that well.
You want him out of here
and I want Snowy Peaks.
Two birds...
...one stone.
But you know Pop Sandrich
will never sell.
He won't have to.
His 40-year lease
with the park commission
is up for renewal.
And if he should have a
couple of major violations,
oh, son of a gun, you
know he could lose it?
Poor Pops.
Well...
I guess my 11:00 can wait.
And, you know, what if
Pops does lose his lease?
I just might have to make
you prince of Maristown.
There won't be any room
for Jerry Cramer.
Hey, old timer!
Old timer?
Boy, you're just
lucky the doc says
no more skiing on these knees,
or I'd tan your hide
in a run down K-7.
Oh, glad to
have you back, Jerry.
Glad enough to pay me the overtime
you owe me from last season?
Well, I had to make sure
you'd come back, didn't I?
Look at this place,
Jerry. Look at it!
Don't open for two days
and it's already jammed.
Hey, Pops, while I'm here,
I'm gonna run these
up to the bar.
Yeah, thataboy. Take 'em up there.
Yeah.
Hey, Pops, Stan gave
me a ride over here
and I didn't want to ask
him so I'll ask you.
Is he gonna try out
for the patrol again?
Yep.
All right,
I'll keep an eye on him.
Amongst other things.
That niece of mine
is quite a woman.
See you later, son.
Do your stuff.
Wait a minute! Stop!
Oh, no, Dumpster!
He's not moving. Oh!
Oh, help me, someone!
Is he... Is that blood?
What is that?
Jerry, I am so sorry.
I didn't see him.
Is there anything I can do?
Well, you... You can just...
Hold me.
And comfort me all night.
All night? All night.
This dog does not
need a vet, Jerry,
he needs a little black coffee.
He is drunk.
And he was doing so well
on the program.
You know, he's pretty cute,
but what are you hanging
around with such a mutt for?
He's not a mutt.
I was talking to the dog.
Hey, Stan.
Hey, Jerry. How's it going?
Okay. Hi, Dumpster.
What've you got there?
Oh, it's Thera-Band.
It's brand new.
They're putting it in
all the first-aid kits.
See? It stretches
but it doesn't break.
I'm just using it to beef up my
forearms for recertification.
I'm gonna make it this year.
Good.
* Now that I can dance
* Watch me now
* Now work it out, y'all
* Now, now, now, now, you are
driving me crazy now, now, baby
* Just a little soul now, y'all.
Help me, Stevie!
* Work it out, baby
* Oh, you're driving me crazy
* Oh, just a little bit
of soul now.
Help me, Michael.
* I do mashed potatoes
* I can do the twist
* Tell me, brothers
* Can you moonwalk like this?
Eddie Murphy!
Come on, y'all, what
you wanna tell me now?
Y'all are gonna tell me now.
Come on.
Can y'all tell me now?
* Do you love me now?
* Do you love me now?
* Do you love me?
* Now that I can dance.
Iceman!
Ice! Ice!
Jerry, what's happening, boy?
What's going on there?
Good to see you! How you doin'?
Nice!
Yo, tell me something, man,
is that a perm or what?
Hey, man, it's natural beauty.
Don't make jokes, all right?
All right, it's cool.
Is that your new toy?
Toy? Toy?
$529.99 plus tax. Toy?
Look here, baby, this
is my key to the top.
Let me tell you something.
After this season, it's goodbye
Snowy Peaks, hello Caesar's Palace.
You know what I'm saying?
So, naturally, the Iceman...
Uh-oh.
Gang way! Clear out!
Four, three, two, one!
Here's Eddie!
Hey!
Welcome back, my boy!
Martinez! Martinez!
Martinez! Marti... Martinez!
Just because you're
the explosives expert
does not mean
you can just blow in here
in that hot rod, is that clear?
Hey, Myron, buddy!
I brought you something
for your bullhorn.
Get down!
You crazy, man.
Oh, look, the Ranchero!
A few more mascots than
last year, huh, guys?
Yeah, what do you know?
They followed me from my
apartment in New York.
I get no respect!
Uh, I tell ya,
anybody got a cat?
Hey, man, you need...
You need to work on that.
Same room?
Same room, bro.
Okay, come on.
Hey, did you hear what
happened to me last summer?
I read about it!
Long as we don't have to
test it on those mice.
Whoa! Whoa!
Damn.
Hey.
Oh, man, it's 4:30
in the morning.
This is lame.
You know Murray.
Since he's director, he has
to play everything official.
Yeah.
Hey, Ice, how come
you're not complaining?
Ice?
Ice!
Oh, man, you woke me up.
Man, I was just having a dream.
Me and Rhonda were
just getting ready...
All right, can I have
your attention, please?
Thank you.
It is with great pleasure
that I introduce to you
your guiding light
for the next few months.
Let's all say hello
to our director,
Murray Tuttle!
What in the Sam Hill
did I trip...
Whose dog is this?
It's mine. Handsome
hound, isn't he, Murr?
Cramer, I hate dogs. I...
See, I am allergic to dogs.
Hey, but he loves you, Murr.
Get him out of here!
Now, every...
Everybody listen up!
Listen up.
Inspector Crabitz
of the park service
decides who makes this team,
but you bozos got to
get past me first.
So for those of you who've been
wasting my time for seven years,
it's a full-fledged tryout.
Now...
This season,
I'm very pleased to say
that visiting us
from a foreign country
is someone very special.
This sweet young lady's
name is Tiana Chechornia.
Uh, Czeckornia.
Isn't that something?
Now she is an exchange
patroller from Bratslavea.
Bratislava.
Shut up, Myron!
She's here to study
our techniques.
So don't make me look stupid.
Is that clear to everybody?
All right.
Let's see what you got.
- All right!
- All right.
Okay, let's go.
Meet you later, guys. Bye.
Hey, Murray? What?
Me and the boys got you a gift.
Well, isn't it my lucky day?
Oh, right, yeah. Ha, ha.
Hey, Murray, we're just
trying to help, okay?
We know you have a complex
about your height.
I don't have a complex
about my height!
The only thing complex
around here
is how I'm gonna get you nitwits
through recertification!
Get out of here.
Wha... Oh, hey, look. Look.
Does this... Does this
stuff really work?
Murray, it works.
All right, let's go!
Okay, guys, pay attention.
This is our 75mm
recoilless rifle.
It's our avalanche buster.
What do you people think
this is, a fiesta?
There are too many
people up there.
Now one of you, come on down.
Ow!
Come on, let's go.
Oh, Stan, Stan.
Stanley, son,
I believe the same thing
happened last year, didn't it?
Well, actually,
it was two years ago.
Okay.
Shooting the hole is the
toughest run on the mountain.
Now I want y'all to be careful,
but I want to see
some speed down there!
Whoa.
Sending down the first one.
Go for it.
Nice job! Eddie, you're up.
Here comes number two.
Look, for some reason, I
just can't shoot the hole.
Look, all you need
is confidence, Stanley.
You can do it.
Yeah, man, just relax.
Chill out.
You see, shooting the hole
is just like making love.
I've never made love.
Good luck.
Here comes number three.
Go for it, man.
See you at the bottom.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God!
Oh! Oh, no!
Oh, God!
There goes his family life.
Oh, oh! Oh, no!
All right, everybody in!
Martinez...
Good work.
Iceman...
Thank you very much,
Mr. Tuttle.
My mom is gonna appreciate
this very much.
She's gonna love it.
Thank you, sir. Good work.
Oh, Lord, 911!
911! Somebody
call the ambulance!
Oh, that's funny. That's brilliant.
That's real funny.
You know, Iceman,
I bet you're gonna win
that Poolitzer Prize for humor.
It's Pulitzer.
Shut up, Myron.
Where's Cramer?
Murr?
Don't sneak up on me, boy.
Kind of like
a general, huh, Murr?
Yeah, like a general
pain in the butt.
Now, listen, Cramer, with seniority
comes something special.
Oh, the R word? Yes, Cramer!
The R word.
Responsibility, Cramer.
Goes for all of you!
Responsibility.
Now please don't let me down...
Oh!
What the...
Murr, looks like
you made a new friend.
Get that beast
out of here, Cramer.
And I mean it! Or I'm... I'm gonna
turn on you like a mother-in-law.
Here... Oh! Oh!
And another thing.
Get these... These
vermin out of here.
Cramer, this is against
health regulations.
Catch my drift, son?
Get 'em out of here.
All right, everybody out.
Come on. Everybody out.
What do you want?
A gold pin. Did I pass?
A gold pin?
You want a gold pin, do you?
Well, let me... Let me put
it this way, Stanley.
Son, I hope you can shovel
better than you ski.
I'm so sorry, Stanley.
Oh, that... That's okay.
Same thing happened last year.
I guess I should be getting
used to it by now.
I know how much you wanted
to be on the patrol.
I wish you could be.
Well, if they ever
start a shovel patrol,
I'll definitely be
in charge of that.
Thanks anyway, Tiana.
* Girl stood on
the burning deck... *
Who the hell is parked
in my spot?
Oh, hi.
The band and me were just
jamming for the talent show.
Kind of loud, but loud's
best, right, man?
Yeah, right, yeah.
Look here, little mister,
you get this oversized trash
compactor out of here
or I'm gonna tear you...
What'd that guy want?
Well, he wants to come in.
Let him in!
They say come on in.
Who? Them, the band.
Who? They want to meet you.
I don't know who you're...
They're right over there.
Who? Come on in.
Oh, my Lord.
Meet the band.
This is Buried.
If you want us to leave,
we will, kind sir.
The guys call me Suicide.
I play drums.
And over here, the
wizard of the keyboards.
This is Slaughter.
You want trouble,
you got trouble!
He likes you. No, I don't!
He's a little temperamental.
Would you like to hear
some of our music?
No, thank you, that's...
Great! That's great.
Shut it off!
Shut it...
...off.
That's music, huh?
And this is our inspiration.
Rocket skis!
Speed, thrills and fun!
See, with these, we'll
taste death, live life.
Hold on there a minute,
little buddy boy.
You use rocket skis
on my slopes,
and the only thing
you, you and you
are gonna be tasting
is my foot in your face.
Do you read me?
Like a comic book.
Like a biker magazine!
Like Vogue.
Son, did anybody ever tell you
you're a few sandwiches
short of a picnic?
Okay, great. You guys
are doing great.
Brooke, keep
your edges in, okay?
Your inside edges. Good.
Cindy, you're awesome.
Look at you!
What do we think?
I think I want to go home.
You, candy ass,
we can't take you anywhere!
Hey, come on, guys,
don't fight, all right?
All right,
let's just go for it!
Yeah.
So what are we waiting for?
Let's shred this hill!
He's right.
Taste death, live life!
Yeah!
Oh, no!
Looks like someone
to play with.
Then let's play hardball.
Look out, no brakes!
Excuse me!
Out of the way!
I love it!
This is better than sex!
Hey!
What's that guy doing up
here with a snowboard?
What's he doing with our sign?
Then let's go nail the sucker!
Come on, man.
Hey, guys, we crossed
the finish line first!
Oh, no! Whoa!
Hey, Ice, how about the
old clothes-line trick?
Let's do it.
I'm real!
I think I wet my pants!
Coming through!
Whoa!
Honey, you got anything
to cool this down?
Oh, no!
Thanks.
That's great, you guys. You're
doing great. Keep it up.
That's good.
Hey, you're gonna
kill yourself!
I am!
You idiot!
Sorry. This is my first time.
Wait! What's that?
What's what?
That! That! It
looks like a rope!
Damn, man, don't pull so hard.
We're gonna eat it!
No!
I'm so sorry, Mr. Patrolman.
Sorry, my ass!
Taste death, live life.
Let's get Larry, Moe
and Curly out of here.
Yeah. All right, come on.
Oh, thank you.
Thanks.
Hey. How are you?
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you again.
All right, fellas, listen up.
Remember, time is money.
Keep those unprofitable
group lessons short
and always be on the
lookout for ass grabbers.
Ass grabbers, sir?
Rich, middle-aged women.
You grab their ass and they'll
practically beg you to take their money,
among other things.
Hi. How you doing?
Hi, how are you?
Right, left, right, left...
- Stop!
- Hold it!
Ready on the right?
Ready on the left?
Ice?
All set, Jerry.
Free for all!
* Old man rhythm
standing in my shoes
* No need sitting or
singing the blues
* So be my guest.
What the hell is that?
* Won't you let me
take you on a sea cruise?
* Ooh-ee
* Ooh-ee, baby, ooh-ee
* Ooh-ee, baby
* Ooh-ee
* Ooh-ee, baby
* Won't you let me take
you on a sea cruise?
* Feel like jumpin', baby,

get my hat off the rack.
That was great!

* Won't you let me take
you on a sea cruise? *
Okay, time to put a little
tarnish on ski patrol's shine.
Maris' plan, phase one.
Hello.
Thanks.
Uh, excuse me, sir?
There's a $5 admission.
Oh, I guess you don't know who I am.
I'm Sam Maris.
Maris Realty and Home Loan.
I'm usually comp-ed
at things like this.
Yes, Mr. Maris, I know who you
are, but you still have to pay $5.
Look, nothing goes on in this town
that I can't just walk right...
What's the trouble, Ellen?
Sandrich, would you please tell
this lady that I'm your guest?
Make him pay.
Don't worry,
it's tax-deductable.
Thanks. Have a good time.
No, thank you.
Jeez.
Hey, Stan, my man! Pull up a chair, dude.
Right, Myron?
Oh, they said that this table's
only for ski patrollers.
I didn't pass the test.
Are you kidding?
Any man who cleans up
after this squad
deserves to be in this squad.
Now sit down, homey,
with your bad coat on.
Thanks.
I'm glad you came.
Thanks.
Oh! Here, I brought
this for you.
It kind of got squished, but...
For me?
Thank you, Stanley.
Aw, gee.
Can I have
your attention, please?
Would you please help me
in giving a warm welcome
to her honor, Mayor Biard?
Thank you.
Forty years ago,
Pop Sandrich traded his
saddle for a pair of skis,
and not only founded
this ski lodge,
but our community as well.
Pops, tonight is your night.
Pops, for your 40 years of joy
and caring and
community spirit,
the whole town would like
to present you with...
Oh, no. What...
Hey! Hey, those are our mice.
How'd they get here?
Please don't step on 'em!
Let's just get 'em!
I'm doing this
for the neighborhood.
I got one.
...40th anniversary and I...
Edna.
Inspector Crabitz
to you, Sandrich.
Another one!
Now you people know that mice
are against health regulations.
Where the hell'd
they come from?
We don't know.
I do.
They're pets.
Of the ski patrol.
Well, pets or no pets,
I'm gonna have to
write you a citation.
It's your first one
in years, Sandrich.
Better make it your last.
Well, strike one, gentlemen.
Let's make it a quick inning.
Oh, no!
Can I help you, ma'am?
Yes, I lost my contact lens.
Your contact? Where?
Somewhere on this mountain.
Can you help me find it?
Yeah.
Where are we going?
Murray wants the main trails
checked for obstacles.
Okay. I'll go down
Badger's Pass.
Okay, I'll take Turner's.
All right.
Guys, can you help me
find my contact lens?
- You bet!
- Yeah, sure, no problem.
Uh, Jerr? Jerry?
Do you read me?
Jerry, come in!
What's up? Eddie?
Hello?
I got a little problem here.
Oh, whoa, whoa!
- He almost killed us!
- This is crazy!
Really!
Come check this out! Hurry up.
Uh, Jerr? Make that
a big problem.
Keep digging.
Hey, did anybody
lose a contact lens?
This bothers me, Eddie. These
machines were overhauled last week.
How could something
like this happen?
I don't know, Jerr. All I know
is it was fine yesterday.
Yeah.
Eddie, for God's sakes,
you all right?
Yeah, thanks, Pop. But I
think this puppy's history.
Jerry, my God, this
really is a mess.
Yeah, it is.
A bigger mess
than you think, Sandrich.
Edna. Well, uh...
This is unfortunate.
What's unfortunate
is that Snowy Peaks now has two
major violations against it.
A lousy way to
start a season, Sandrich.
And a patrol that can't
keep a mountain safe
ain't gonna be
a patrol anymore.
Wait a second, Edna.
These boys are good boys. They've
never let me down before.
Look, I'm warning you people,
any more of this crap,
and I'm gonna close
this mountain down.
Edna, we have an impeccable
safety record here.
I'll vouch for these kids.
They... Now, listen!
They are some of the best
patrollers in the state, Edna.
Would you please
take this back?
So, hotshot!
This season's barely begun
and you've already blown it.
Well, I...
No! No! You listen to me.
You shape up or I will baste
you like a Butterball.
And don't you think I can't do it, boy.
Shape up!
What the hell did I trip...
* All night long
* From midnight on
* Took my girl
to church last night
* Let me tell you
what she went and done
* She stood right up
in the preacher's face
* And she chewed her
chewing gum all night... *
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait just a goldarn minute.
Well, slap me silly.
This stuff's really working.
Ooh, better not overdo it!
It's... It's really working.
I can't believe it.
It's really, really working!
No more "short stuff!"
No more "Mr. Little-Big!"
Here I come.
Hello, darlings.
Iceman, Cramer!
Plunk my tired,
weary ass right here.
Go for it, Murr.
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa,
Murray, slow down. Okay?
You got to know
when to say when.
Shut up. This stuff makes
me sleep like a baby.
Besides, I wanna tell you
boys a little secret.
Because of those pills
that Martinez gave me,
I've grown three inches
in the last two days.
Oh? Go on!
I ain't shitting you!
I wouldn't have
believed it myself
if I hadn't seen it
with my own eyes.
Hey, listen, I can't
fit in my own car.
Good. 'Cause you see, drinking
and driving do not mix,
that's why
I'm driving you home.
Not yet, you ain't.
I'm gonna find me
a big, tall redhead.
I'm gonna get out on that
floor and cut the rug.
Murr, look, alcohol
and growth pills
can cause weird and
strange things to happen.
Well, it so happens that
tall people such as myself,
can handle...
Liquor.
I saw this shit
in The Exorcist.
Stanley.
Oh, hi!
Hi. I tried to call you
but you have no phone.
Oh, I don't need one.
Who'd want to call me?
I would. You're very special.
To you, I can talk. Most American
men interested only in sex.
Sex! Oh, I'm not
interested in that.
Well, I mean, I am,
but I wouldn't...
Well, I would, but, you know, I don't.
Well, I...
Would you like to dance?
Dance? Uh, no.
Do you know how?
Oh, sure. No, really, I do.
Let's dance.
Oh, uh...
Come on. Stanley!
Okay, Stanley!
That's my boy, Stan!
Do you always carry
champagne with you?
Well, class is my middle name.
I think I'm gonna
let this breathe.
Jerry, pour the champagne.
Ellen, you know
I'm crazy about you.
Honestly,
what do you think of me?
I think you're an immature,
wisecracking ski bum.
Oh, no, don't sugarcoat it.
Actually, you're
pretty irresistible.
But you should settle down, start
thinking about the future.
Jerry, what are you doing?
Thinking about the future.
I think we should go skiing.
Jerry, what happened?
Jerry? What...
You!
Holy shit.
Holy shit!
I overdid it.
I took too many of these pills.
I'm a frigging giant!
Huh?
You bastards!
I'm gonna get you, Cramer!
I'm gonna get you!
Now that's what I call
dangerous curves.
Terrific! All right.
Excellent.
Brenda, you're beautiful.
Okay. Nice angle.
Keep stepping into it.
Beautiful!
Oh, that's it. Yeah!
Nice. Yeah.
Throw your hair back.
All right. Beautiful.
Excellent. Oh, great.
Got to have it.
Yeah.
That was terrific,
girls. Thank you.
Now all we've got to do is take
those Snowy Peaks promo shots
we promised Mr. Maris
and we'll be done.
Who's Maris?
Excuse me. Coming through.
Look at this. This is wonderful.
Looking good.
Thanks for coming.
How you doing?
Good. Just grab a girl up there.
Thanks for coming.
I love it. Let's do it.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Maybe you're right.
Just do it!
Okay. Okay.
We need another guy to even this out.
Here, take this.
Have we got somebody over here
that can even this line out?
Yo, man, you see
this guy right here?
This here is the head honcho...
No, this guy... Of ski patrol.
Great. Come on over.
Here's your man! Go!
Get over there, man.
Go on, man. Heard that. Yeah.
Thank you. Head honcho, huh?
All right. Right in the center.
Grab a girl.
How do you steer this thing?
Who cares? Go faster!
I'm going, I'm going.
I love it!
Okay, you guys are doing so good.
I'm so proud.
Especially you now, Nancy. I want
you to keep your arms up, okay?
And keep your head up and look
over my shoulder, all right?
Damn that guy.
Sheila, wait right here.
I'll be right back, okay?
Hey, idiot!
You're being paged.
I'm no idiot!
Stop this thing
before you kill somebody!
I'm hooked up on your binding.
Will you stop?
I'm caught. I'm caught!
Stop this thing, damn it!
Code blue! Slope 10. It's Ellen
attached to runaway ski sailor!
Can you hear me? It's Ellen.
Ellen.
Damn.
Is that better, dear?
Oh, yes, much better.
Oh, much better!
What are you doing?
Hey, ladies, how you doing?
Well, nice chatting with you.
And remember, I'm a professional.
Don't try this at home.
Station 4-A. Stand by
with an M-40. Stat!
Jerry! Jerry, help!
Hold on! I'm coming!
Jerry!
Jerry! Hurry up, Jerry!
Oh, Jerry.
You okay? Don't
ever do that again.
Whoa! Who was that masked man?
I wanted to thank him.
Gentlemen, the safety
portion of Crabitz's test.
Oh, correction.
An advanced copy of the safety
portion of Crabitz's test.
How'd you get this?
Um, little wallet-sized
pictures of presidents.
With that plus what
you guys are gonna do
to the ski patrol's equipment,
there's no way
they're gonna pass.
This time tomorrow, Pops Sandrich
will be ancient history.
And Maristown will be born.
And I'll be the proud new papa.
Yeah, well, I just thought of another
idea of ensuring our little bet.
Come on.
How you doing?
Ho, I'll tell you, kid,
this is some place to come shopping
with your mom, understand?
Hey.
Hi.
Hey, hey, this stuff.
Perfect.
Oh, hey, Martinez,
what's going on?
Yo, Finkmeyer, what brings
you to a hardware store?
Let me guess. Looking
for a snap-on tool?
Look, Edward,
I know there's been
a lot of bad blood
between the ski patrol
and the ski school,
but I really think it's
time to bury the hatchet
and put it all behind us, huh?
Adios, amigo.
Excuse me, Mr. Philips?
Hi.
I hate being
the bearer of bad news,
but that ethnic fellow
over there,
he's pulling a Frito
Bandito number on you.
You go check his pockets,
we'll get the police.
Eddie Martinez in jail?
Martinez? I don't believe it.
Why would he steal?
I don't know, but there must be something
we can do. Now you've got to...
Right.
Okay.
They won't budge on the bail.
Shoplifting?
I don't believe it.
We gotta get him out of there.
If you guys don't pass
this inspection tomorrow,
Pops is gonna
lose the mountain.
We can't let that
happen to him.
And Eddie's got to set off those
explosives tomorrow and...
Yeah, I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear it.
How much money do we have?
$412.
There are 25 ski patrollers
and all we have is $412?
Oh, that's just beautiful.
Well, I guess I can hock
my singing machine.
Wait a minute.
Yeah, this is it. Hold on.
Yeah, guys, come here.
This is it!
Yeah! Check it out.
"Mountain High Bar
talent contest."
"Winner take all, $1,000."
Give me this thing. $1,000?
I can do that.
I can do... Man, I can knock
this town on its butt.
Wait, wait, wait,
you guys, hold it.
We can't just walk in
there with this machine.
We gotta do something
different here.
Yeah, but I got it.
The Iceman has got it.
How about
a singing-and-dancing-
choreographed-rip-you-up, ow, duet?
Duet? You're the only
good singer we've got.
You see, with this machine
I can prerecord
the other parts,
make it sound any way
the Iceman wants.
All we need is
a kick-ass dancer.
Oh, no!
Oh, yeah.
You can kick some ass.
First time I saw you I said,
"He be kicking some ass."
No, I wasn't kicking
anyone's... No.

I tried to stay away

Thank you.
Michelle Rohl, ladies and
gentlemen, with the score to beat.
For the next act,
could you plug the output of
this machine into your PA?
Yeah, sure.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
we have a last-minute entry,
one you'll have
to see to believe.
From our local ski patrol,
Stanley and the Iceman.

Ladies and gentlemen, I
believe we have our winners.
Stanley and the Iceman!
Yes! All right, we did it!
Party! Hey, party!
Ice, Ice, I need the money, man,
to spring Eddie out of jail.
Yeah, all right, man.
Go ahead, do it. Do it.
See you later.
Hey, Ice, wait up.
Stanley.
I have never met
anyone like you.
I'll bet.
I've been wanting to do
something for a long time
but I needed your permission.
Go ahead.
The lodge has passed
every other test.
Now it's up to you people.
Hey, don't worry, Pops.
It's in the bag.
Yeah, we got you covered, Pops.
Okay, let's move it.
Hey, hey, Cramer! I think that's my job.
I'm the director.
Okay.
Let's move!
Well, that's the last of 'em.
- Prefire safety check.
- Aiming mechanism.
Check. Clear in front?
Clear in front.
Clear in the rear?
Clear in the rear. Clear!
Uh-oh.
"Uh-oh" what?
Oh, no!
Man, it don't make sense. The
sight was fine an hour ago.
Now it's 50 degrees off.
I don't know what to say.
Try "goodbye."
Because as of 5:00 today,
this mountain is closed.
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
everybody,
may I have your
attention for a moment?
No cowboy can stay
on a bronc forever.
And 40 years
is a good long ride.
What I'm trying to say is.
Snowy Peaks has lost its lease.
And the park officials have
revoked your patrol licenses.
And for the good of the valley,
I've decided to
sell to Sam Maris.
I love you all. I know
how hard you've tried,
but we just came up a day late
and a dollar short.
I know this is as much a
shock to you as it is to me,
so take your time cleaning
out your belongings.
You got half an hour
to get off the mountain.
Move. Move.
Don't worry about it, man.
It'll be all right.
Just chill out, okay?
Need a suitcase, Cramer?
Lance, just lay off.
It's a little early
for vultures, isn't it?
This one wanted to pick
while the meat was fresh.
Hey, come on! Come on.
Anytime, Cramer.
It's all right, man.
I'm really sorry
about this, boys.
But you're all good patrollers
and you'll find a new lodge.
New lodges, but not new homes.
Pops, don't you see someone
pulled a fast one on us?
What are you saying, son?
We've been sabotaged!
Someone went to a hell of a lot
of trouble to make sure we'd fail
and kick us out of here.
Yeah, but who'd do that?
Hey, guys, come here. Check this out.
Come here.
Come here, look at this.
Check it out over here.
He did take the duty roster
from the locker room.
Yeah, somebody moved
the Howitzer sight,
screwed up all our machines.
Pops?
I don't think, I know.
I just don't know
how to prove it.
I'm gonna have a little
talk with Mr. Maris.
Maris, we've got to talk.
It's about how you
sabotaged this mountain.
I sabotaged this mountain?
You're out of
your mind, old man.
Taste death, live life!
Maybe we shouldn't.
Shut up, geek! It's showtime!
Holy shit!
This is an $800 jacket.
You still own this mountain,
you're gonna pay for it.
You got any napkins
in this dump?
Back away, Maris!
Back away! This
thing's ready to go!
Get out! I can't!
Oh, please stop! Hey,
get me out of here!
I'm stuck on a goddamned
runaway weenie! Hey!
Let's do it!
Somebody do something!
Get me loose! Please!
Somebody!
Hey, Pops, hop on
and hold on tight.
We about to do our thing!
Let's go!
Somebody get me out of here!
Hey, please,
get me out of here!
But I want a hot dog.
I want a hot dog!
You're not gonna get one. They
don't even have hot dogs here.
Hey! Stop this thing,
somebody! Anybody!
I'm a very important
person, you hear me?
Stop it!
Hey! Hey, somebody
get me out of here!
Hey! Hey!
Help!
Wait a minute. Wait.
Wait. Tiana, stop, stop.
- Can you hear me?
- I'm stuck!
Tiana, come here.
I'm stuck down here.
Help!
Somebody's got to help me!
Murray.
Help! Somebody help me, please!
Anybody up there?
Hey, get me up from here!
Quiet. Loud noise can
cause an avalanche.
Then, hurry up.
I'm going to traverse down.
Wait, wait, we don't
have the proper rig.
I have an idea.
Help.
Help.
Eddie, tie this on.
Ice, give me your lifeline.
No, man, I'll do it.
No, no, no, no.
I'll do it.
Pops, no, you're not.
You sure you can handle it?
You bet your ass I can handle it.
Give me that rope.
Hiya, Sam!
Don't "Hi, Sam" me!
Just throw me the rope.
Hey, I'd like to tell
you a little story.
It'll help you relax.
The story's about how
a heartless land developer
and his three
ski-school lackeys...
They... Oh, hell.
You already know this story.
You wrote it.
You can't prove a thing.
Don't have to.
You're gonna blow
your own whistle
or ride this hot dog
down the express route.
You've lost your mind, old man.
No.
Just my lodge.
I ain't got
nothing else to lose.
Oh, my God!
All right, listen!
The violations, the testing,
the Howitzer, everything,
it was all...
It was all my fault.
Ski patrol's not to blame.
Okay, here's the rope!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Oh, God bless you.
Maris, this is as close as you'll
ever come to being a hot dog.
Oh, hey, Pops, see you
on the slopes tomorrow?
You bet. We'll be there.
Ooh, yeah! I like that, man.
All right.
What are they doing?
What are they doing?
Come here, doggie.
Come here.
How's Dumpster doing?
Okay so far.
Sweet baby puppy,
come here to Daddy.
Come here to Daddy. Yes.
Oh, yes. Yes, yes. Yes.
Murray, how are you doing?
I've just about got it.
Oh, no. Oh, no!
Don't sneeze!
Oh, no!
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord, help me! Oh!
Pull!
Pull!
Oh! Ow! Oh, pull! Yeah.
Here we go,
here we go! Oh, pull!
It's okay!
Hey, guys, look!
Oh, man, they're getting away!
Let's go!
Let's get 'em!
Ice, throw me a rope.
Ice, what's that?
Thera-Band, man. It's
the only thing we got.
Here, catch!
Just be careful, will you?
You guys keep going.
Don't stop!
Go faster! Faster!
Ice, cut me loose.
Oh, shit!
Look out!
Check this, Cramer!
Give it up, Finkmeyer!
Get off this mountain!
Never, Cramer.
Bonehead!
Limbo!
See you later, Cramer!
Let go of me! Let go of me!
- ...with your bad self.
- Iceman?
Yo?
He looks like a
patroller, doesn't he?
Wait a minute, Eddie,
check this out.
See? I told you he was going to
kick ass, didn't I tell you that?
Thanks, guys.
Congratulations, Stan.
Thanks. A ski-patrol man!
Guys? Guys!
Okay, everybody. All
right, gather around.
Come on, come on.
Get one, get one.
Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.
Now, well, now.
I'm not... I'm not very good
at making mushy speeches,
but I would like to
thank you all and to...
Well, here's to
a job well done!
All right! Yeah!
And to Pops, who still owes
me last season's overtime.
Hey, hey, now!
Listen, don't forget about
Snowy Peaks' newest mascot.
You sweet little... Yes, you are.
You're a sweet thing.
That's crazy, man.
I'll go down for help.
You ain't going down
without us!
I think we're all going down!
Help!
