My heart is sad - I dare not tell,
My heart is sad for Somebody.
I could wake a winter night
For the sake of Somebody.
There's no one with me,
I've got to find Someone.
AN OFFICE ROMANCE
I could range the world around
For the sake of Somebody.
For the sake of Somebody...
<I>I could range the world around...

As you all know...
...labour ennobles mankind.
That is why people find delight
in going to work.
I personally go to work...
...only because it ennobles me.
If not for statistics...
...we wouldn't have
the slightest idea...
...how well we work.
This is
Ludmila Prokofievna Kalugina.
Director of our statistic bureau.
She knows well the business
that she manages.
Such things do happen, too.
She comes to the office
well before hours.
And leaves after everyone
has already left.
Which means that, alas...
...she is not married.
We call her "our hag".
Behind her back, certainly.

Every morning, before I get to work...
...I get rid of my hooligans.
Here are 40 kopecks,
buy 2 cartons of milk.
- Don't you forget that!
- OK!
And don't forget
to eat breakfast!
Now, you. When will you
stop misbehaving?
Why does everybody
complain of you?
I'm not misbehaving!
Why don't they complain
of other kids?
Why did you eat playdough?
But I ate it with sugar!
But you're a grown-up man.
You know you can't eat playdough.
Why did you lock Masha
in a wardrobe?
I locked her,
and then lost the key.
Go! And don't you dare to smear
the teacher's chair with glue!
OK, OK!
My name is Anatoly Efremovich
Novoseltsev.
I exist on my salary, that is,
hand to mouth.
In a word, I make ends meet...
...finding ways and means.
This is Olga Petrovna Ryzhova.
Olya.

She's my truest friend.
We became friends
when we were students.
What I like most of all about her
is her optimism.
Come what may...
...but we all know that
optimists move the Earth.
There are too many people
in our city.
Too many visitors,
and too many cars.
And all are rushing somewhere,
all are late for something.
There are crowds everywhere,
standing in long lines.
But anyway, I love this city.
This is my city.
It is a very good city.
This is Verochka.
She is inquisitive,
like all women...
...and feminine, like all secretaries.
Her salary is
that of a secretary.
But her outfits
are all of foreign make.
How she manages that
is mystery.
And this is Shura.
She is likeable
but, unfortunately, energetic.
Once she was put forward
as a union activist...
...and since then nobody
has managed to put her back.
Refreshed by mandatory
morning exercises...
...in the public transportation system...
...we finally come to the office.
Hi.
Morning.
Vovka has torn his shoes again.
Where can I get 20 rubles
till payday?
No idea.
Wait a sec,
I'll buy some pills.
Something for my head, please.
Comrades, it's a collection!
Don't go away!
People, 50 kopecks each.
What is it today?
Masha has got
an addition to the family.
Not my fault.
Who's been born?
A boy or a girl.
I have not found out yet.
People, stay here,
who has not paid!
Sign for me, too.
Who has not paid
for Masha, don't leave!
What a nasty voice!
Where can I find 20 rubles?
I wish I were appointed
the Head of Department.
I would appoint you.
You're a superb statistician,
with great experience.
Go see our hag and talk to her.
Jesus, who to appoint but you?
No, it's past belief.
Let's go.
Go talk to our hag. Tell her
you've got two kids.
She doesn't even know
that there is such a thing as kids.
She's sure they
are born as adults...
...in accordance with
the staff instructions.
But extra 50 rubles
do not grow on trees.
No, they don't...
It's not even
about the money.
I am just bored
sitting at my desk.
I feel an overaged retard.
I can do more.
Then go to her office
and tell her that.
No, I won't talk to her.
I hate begging.
I am a proud man.
Each morning starts
the same way in our bureau.
It's become a habit.
A tradition.
I'd say, a ritual.
Peter Ivanovich Bublikov.
Head of Public Catering Dept.
Maybe that's why
he is so... well-padded.
And this is
Yuri Grigorievich Samokhvalov.
He is a very good man.
I have known him for ages,
since university.
All this trouble started
when he came.
It started one usual morning...
...when our statistic beauties...
...were through with the war paint...
...and dived into the delightful,
magical, poetic world...
...of the accounts, balance sheets,
and profit-and-loss reports.
You were the last to leave.
Have you checked the lock?
[Why are you asking?]
[We split up yesterday.]
I do remember.
You were very rude.
I am sorry.
Is Ludmila Prokofievna in?
Yes, wait a minute.
By the way,
you fried eggs on my pan...
...and didn't even wash it!
What is that rubbish
that you are smoking?
By the way, my name
is Yuri Grigorievich.
I'll call you back!
I am sorry,
I thought you are a visitor.
So, is Ludmila Prokofievna in?
Yes, please.
Good morning,
Ludmila Prokofievna!
I am present for duty.
Guess what I'm smoking
right now!
Marlboro!
Rich man's generosity.
The new Deputy
cast off a whole block of cigs.
Making friends
with a secretary.
Right now he is at the crone's.
[And I don't care now, who
makes friends with you.]
Sorry. I called you
automatically.
Never will call again.
Allow me to bring you
a present from Switzerland.
This is an 8-colour pen.
Very convenient
for signing documents.
Black is for "Refuse"...
...red is for "Pay",
green is the colour of hope...
...blue is for "Consider further".
Thank you.
Very funny.
Please, have a seat.
Vera, call Novoseltsev, please.
Which Novoseltsev?
A Novoseltsev.
A weak, inactive worker.
We have many of them.
So, Yuri Grigorievich...
Anatoly Efremovich!
Kalugina wants to see you.
Coming!..
She is calling me herself.
Do not lose your chance.
You have to leave her office
the Head of Department.
You say! For her, I am zero.
Just like anybody else.
So, review the work
of the Chemical Industry Dept.
Fine.  in Switzerland,
I worked with chemical statistics...
...then supervise the installation
of computers.
Yes. In Switzerland, computers...
I am very glad they have
computers there.
What I am not glad about, though,
is our Light Industry Dept.
It is still without a head...
[Novoseltsev is waiting.]
...and I can't find a fitting candidate.
Let him in!
Come in!
Come in, don't be afraid.
- You called me,
did you?
Take a seat,
comrade Novoseltsev.
Tolya! Tolka, damn you!
Yurka! What brings you here?
- Where are you from?
- I work here.
What's the matter, comrades?
Glasses, moustache, you're bald!..
Well, not bald completely...
Comrade Novoseltsev.
This is my old friend.
I see.
Comrade Novoseltsev.
Well, wait a sec.
Comrade Novoseltsev,
is this your report?
Yes.
When you do something...
...do it carefully
or don't do it at all.
Statistics is a science.
It does not bear approximations.
How can you use unverified data?
Why? I verified them.
Have you ever noticed regular
interruptions in the supply of goods?
Sure, I go shopping.
In Switzerland, shops...
This happens because deliveries...
...are scheduled
by such gapers as you.
Kindly rework it.
Getting back to our business.
I ask you as my deputy to pay
a special attention to discipline.
Unfortunately, our discipline
is rather poor.
Novoseltsev, anything else?
Ye...es.
What?
- A question...
- Which question?
No, no questions.
No questions?
You may go.
Tolya, please wait for me there.
I'll be quick.
During work hours,
they would run shopping.
And recently we had
an outrageous case.
Absolutely shocking,
in my opinion.
In the women's toilet
room - pardon me...
Somebody put
a "Pantyhose for sale" ad there.
It's perfectly monstrous.
Do you know who was appointed
our hag's deputy?
No. Who?
Guess.
Can't guess. Who, then?
Yurka!
Which Yurka?
Skip it! As if you
didn't go out together.
Samokhvalov!?
Who could've thought that!?
How does he look now?
Fit as a fiddle.
- Yura!
- Olya...
Jesus, you look smart.
Only against me.
Olya, you haven't changed a bit.
You say!
I am so glad to see you.
So am I.
Guys, where can we talk?
I can't invite you to my office.
Kalugina ordered
that it should be repaired.
As always, you know:
a new boss starts...
...with repairing his own office.
How's life, Olya?
Great.
A separate flat, not in the city,
but close to the railway station.
And my son, Vitka, is 14 already.
He is a sportsman, winner of
the long-jump competition.
What's that you're smoking?
Hold this. Marlboro.
And my husband is also OK.
Professor Pokrovskiy himself
operated on his ulcer.
The surgery was successful.
And then they sent him free
to a health resort.
He's there now.
So that's it, I live, keep in pace.
"The smoke of Fatherland is sweet..."
And how are you?
I'm OK.
I worked in Geneva
for the last two years.
- A Swiss souvenir.
- Thanks.
And how are things in Geneva?
Complicated.
Listen, talking about Switzerland...
...can I rob you of 20 rubles?
This goes against my principles.
I never borrow from my superiors.
I haven't been consecrated yet.
Then I can do it. So far.
I will pay you back on payday.
It's so good you've been appointed.
You should help Tolya.
What's the matter?
Olya, stop it!
Stop it, please!
It's just a rank injustice.
We have a vacancy.
Tolya is the best candidate.
Olya, I beg you, calm down.
He's clever, he's experienced.
Then, he's got two kids on his back.
How are old the kids?
And who's your wife?
That woman dumped him
and left him with two kids.
It was me who took the kids away
from her. It doesn't matter, really.
It's Novoseltsev. Spitting!?
Give him what for!
I'll be a bit later. Yes.
I will go and buy shoes.
And fetch him then. Thanks.
I like this idea
of appointing Tolya.
Just go and appoint him,
if you're the boss.
I'll go and appoint him
right away.
Guys, stop it, please.
I made errors in the report.
And I could change for the worse
in all these years!
You can't be too bad to become
the head of a department.
- That's true.
- Wait here.
Yura, it's not the right time,
believe me!
You know, he hasn't changed a bit.
No. But if he goes on like that,
he won't stay here for long.
Tolya, please, be honest...
am I still... good-looking?
Olya, how can you...
you're perfectly all right.
Ludmila Prokofievna, I've got an idea.
What if we make Novoseltsev...
...the Head of the Light-Industry Dept.?
That he has made a bad report
means nothing.
It's just that he stayed
too low for too long.
I've known him for long,
he's very bright.
Speaking of old friends, I would rather
appreciate your rating people...
...by their business qualities.
Pardon me.
Failed so far. But you can't
do that at one blow.
Guys, have some patience,
and it'll be OK.
I've always believed in you, Yura.
No, it's hopeless...
Don't be afraid, in the office,
I'll stay strictly business-like.
You have always been so tactful,
Olga Petrovna.
Well, you have a chat...
I'll go shopping before
they close for lunch.
We have a very bad lunch break.
Same time as in grocery stores.
What time makes to us...
Do you remember
how she looked once?
We are not getting
any younger either, are we?
With women,
it's more obvious.
I would really like to see
my friend in this position.
Understandable. A new broom...
...places its new men
everywhere, right?
- You are my man, I hope.
- Sure.
Although up to now
I've been nobody's.
Let's go down,
I will show you something.
Vera, please call my car.
First floor, please.
Just a sec!
Are you our new deputy?
Good!
Masha Selezneva has an addition
to her family.
Give me 50 kopecks and sign here.
It's real sweet!
How pleasant to see a man
respond in such a way.
Take the change.
No, I spare no expense
for Masha.
Have you paid?
I have paid.
- Have you?
- I have!
Have you bought new boots, Vera?
I haven't decided yet.
Do you like them?
They attract too much attention.
I wouldn't wear such boots.
And if I were you, I wouldn't be
interested in boots during the hours.
They are good boots, then.
I have to buy them.
Kalugina has no great opinion of you.
She thinks you're a mediocrity.
I think she's right.
Irony is a mask for the helpless.
But we have to find a way
to approach her.
What's her weak point?
She has no weak points.
She is a woman, not young,
not beautiful, lonely...
She is no woman,
she's the director.
What's this? Your car?
Get in, little boy.
I'd say! Is this a Volga?
In a way.
Get in.
It's a small apartment!
And what's this?
Just a stereo.
Ooh... built-in, isn't it?
Two speakers, left and right.
I am going to the Ministry,
will be back late.
Comrade Novoseltsev, attend
to your report, finally.
Ludmila Prokofievna, so
I am waiting for you tonight.
I'll be there.
If you only knew,
how dreadful she is to me.
Like a wolf.
I am having a party tonight
to celebrate my appointment.
Please, come too.
While out of the office,
try to establish a contact with her.
Try stepping up to her a bit.
If I suggest you promotion
again, she'll growl at me.
How can I step up to her,
when she growls?
No, it's a brilliant idea.
Treat her as a woman.
I can't treat her as a woman.
As a man, I can't.
Yes, I can, as a man...
I do not suggest
your flirting her seriously...
...with far-reaching intentions.
Just, well, go for her... slightly.
No position in the world can make
me step up to her.
Let's make a deal:
I am not stepping up...
...and you invite Olya, eh?
I am invited, and she's not.
What's Olya for?
Yes, anyway!
Come around eight.
Bite in. It's good.
Why aren't you eating?
Your home is very nice. Cosy.
And I like your wife.
Here, we have matching tastes.
I hope they will also
match in our work.
What is this thing?
It's a mobile. Kinetic sculpture.
You know, it's in high fashion in Europe.
Used to decorate interiors.
Illusion of a motion. A concept
developed by Scalder, an American.
Our time is all rush and no peace.
At home, it helps to settle your nerves.
Interesting.
Get back to your guests,
they will be bored without you.
How can I leave you alone?
I'll just sit here,
browse through magazines.
Noise wears me down.
I like being alone.
Don't bother.
- Have a rest.
- Thank you.
Tolya, can I see you for a sec?
Coming.
- Tolya!
- I'm coming.
You glutton.
It's a favourable situation.
She is alone there
having a rest.
Good, I will not interrupt her.
Stop being a fool!
Go and offer her a cocktail.
You're the host, you do.
I do understand.
She's a scarecrow.
Don't look at her,
look aside.
Have pity on me!
I'm afraid of her!
Tolya, seize the chance!
- I am afraid.
- Tolya, go ahead!
Well, how do you feel, Olenka?
Your life's grand, Yurka.
Try that salad.
This one? I have.
I am making this salad
better than your wife.
You should add apple paste in it.
Your character hasn't changed.
Do you remember my character?
I remember everything.
So do I.
Tolya! What's this!? Go!
Tolya!
Go now!
Oh Lord, why is it
happening to me?
May I come in,
Ludmila Prokofievna?
You may, comrade Novoseltsev.
Thank you very much.
Have a seat.
Not here.
- Have you got some question?
- No!.. Yes.
Have a cocktail.
I do not drink,
comrade Novoseltsev.
And right you are.
Neither do I.
Then why have you brought it in?
To drink it.
But it was a mistake.
And not the only one.
Ludmila Prokofievna,
I want to say...
You were amazingly far-seeing.
What's that!?
An extraordinary foresight.
I am currently
reworking my report...
...and you know, it's getting
better and better.
Glad to hear it,
comrade Novoseltsev.
Do you like picking mushrooms?
What?
M-mushrooms.
Birch mushrooms.
Aspen mushrooms.
Mushed... mushrooms.
Not interested.
My most sincere condolences.
Picking mushrooms is amazing.
Take stump mushrooms,.
They grow on stumps.
If you find a good stump...
...you can gather a nice pile
of stumps... mushrooms.
Aspen mushrooms,
they grow... under aspens.
Under birches.
Under... spruce... -es.
In dry summers, they like it where
it's wet... in hollows.
You find a hollow, and... there...
picking them, one by one.
You're a great expert in mushrooms,
comrade Novoseltsev.
In mushrooms, yes.
My name is Anatoly Efremovich.
I will remember it.
Would that be all?
No. Yes.
You may go,
comrade Novoseltsev.
Why haven't you offered her
a cocktail?
She doesn't drink.
And what were you doing?
What were you talking about?
Mushrooms.
Why mushrooms?
What else, Yura?
Snakes?
I tried to court her...
I just don't know how.
Last woman I courted was
my wife. 12 year ago.
I must have lost the knack.
Did she understand
you were courting her?
I think not.
Yura, have you been
to a striptease show?
- Never.
- And honestly?
- Why would I need that?
- I would certainly go.
Comrades, Swiss cheese,
Greek olives. You are welcome.
- Do you want to be a senior
statistician all your life? - No.
Can't you think of something
else but courting?
When I see her, my legs sprawl.
Don't stand. Sit down.
I don't know what to talk about.
Talk about something intellectual.
She's a clever aunt.
Intellectual? Damn...
I can... intellectual.
Only, she wouldn't understand.
I will go refresh myself
and start casting pearls.
Yuri Grigorievich! Why don't you
invite me to dance?
I'm inviting you, Olga Petrovna.
After I asked you myself.
Do you remember how we skipped
the finance lecture and went to a cafe?
You made a grand order, and
then you didn't have enough money.
I do remember.
Listen, this Bublikov,
is he from the Catering Department?
- Yes. He is the Head.
- What kind of a man is he.
- Career-seeker.
Won't your wife be jealous?
- Of whom?
- Of me.
Sure will.
Do you remember
how we went kissing to Kuntsevo?
It's not a forest any more,
it's a city.
I do remember.
What can you say about
that Borovskikh?
A swell guy.
You know, I am dancing
with you now...
...and it is as if
no time has passed.
Well, off I go.
Step on the intellect, Tolya.
It's me again.
Haven't we said good-bye already?
That's right. Then let's say hello
again... shall we?
Hello, Ludmila Prokofievna.
Good evening.
May I have a seat?
Suit yourself.
Yes. Well. Thanks.
Aren't you bored,
Ludmila Prokofievna?
No. I am used to being alone.
So I am never bored.
So, I may go, right?
You may stay.
You are not disturbing me.
A cigarette, a match, a matchbox?
Thank you.
And I, if you please...
Cognac, whiskey,
gin, tonic, vodka?
We've agreed I do not drink.
Damn, right! Something happened
to my memory...
What's in the papers?
So far so good.
Why are we sitting here silent,
as if we have nothing to talk about?
Let's talk.
We have talked
about the report...
You are not interested
in mushrooms, are you?
You're right.
Berries?
Not interested either?
Only in jam.
And verses, in poetry?
How do you treat them?
With respect.
Excellent!
Let's talk about poetry.
You know, when I was young, I wrote
verses myself. Didn't you?
No, I had no talent.
Neither had I.
I will read you a little bit,
and you will see for yourself.
Maybe we shouldn't
run the risk?
Why? Let's try.
I would like to make a favorable
impression upon you.
You have already.
I would like to make it stronger.
Some of earlier verses.
In everything I seek to grasp
The fundamental:
The daily choice, the daily task,
The sentimental.
In your early years you were
much more talented than you are now.
Although I could not suppose
your pen name was Boris Pasternak.
And I couldn't suppose
you know poetry.
Good verses,
but you read them poorly.
You judge.
I do.
Friends think I am good at it.
They flatter you. It's awful.
And what do you think about music?
In any form? No?
I hope you are not going
to make a concert?
Yes, I want to sing.
How unfortunate!
Why? Friends say I have
a beatiful descante-baritone.
I just guessed:
are you drunk?
Not at all!
When I am drunk, I am wild!
And right now I am quiet.
I am lucky.
So, what should I sing?
It's not worth the trouble.
So you're sure
I can't sing either.
I am very tired of you,
Novoseltsev.
I will sing to you,
and it will pass.
It's quiet in the woods,
And only the badger can't sleep.
He's hung his ears up on a branch
And dances around the tree.
Are you mad?
So, you don't like
my singing either.
Alas, no.
You don't like anything.
It's hard to please you.
But I will try anyway.
I will dance for you.
A modern dance would hardly suit you.
I will try something classic.
A Russian folk dance, right?
And you will sing!
No, you won't.
I will sing myself.
Yuri Grigorievich!
Take this rowdy away!
You don't like my reciting,
my dancing, and singing...
...because you're dry-as-dust!
That's what you are!
You are callous!
You have nothing human in you!
Yuri Grigorievich,
let him speak.
You have no heart, because
you have only reports and figures!
Let him speak!
Let me go, I haven't finished yet!
You can sack me after all this...
...but I am very glad I have told
you all this in your face.
Thank you for the beautiful evening.
You are welcome,
Ludmila Prokofievna.
I was very glad
to meet you. Thank you.
Goodbye, comrades.
Comrade Ryzhova, goodbye.
Goodbye, Ludmila Prokofievna.
Goodbye, comrade Novoseltsev.
Anatoly Efremovich.
All the best!
May I see you home?
I think it's not worth... the trouble.
Should I see you home,
Ludmila Prokofievna?
He's not as bad,
Ludmila Prokofievna.
I really enjoyed it.
He drank too much.
It's my fault.
It can happen to anybody.
Don't get offended.
I could not expect that.
He talked such drivel.
Why, it's very interesting to learn...
...what your subordinates
think about you.
- Home!
- See you tomorrow.
In trams, we are packed like sardines.
We clatter and drudge along.
And the subway swallows us daily...
...and ejects us again from its mouth.
In noisy streets, in white snowy flutter...
People, we pass by other people.
Our breaths are jumbled together.
Our traces are all mixed up.
We pull out cigarettes from our pockets.
We mumble new popular songs.
And when we elbow each other...
it's just "Sorry" or nothing at all.
Along the same streets of the city
But all on their separate ways
We go unknown to each other
Just touching each other slightly.
PERSONNEL RECORD:
Anatoly E. NOVOSELTSEV
- Hail to the hellbender!
- Hallo.
Can you explain, what maggot
bit you yesterday?
Don't torture me,
I couldn't sleep all night.
OK, just don't think about it.
Go to her and apologize.
Never! I can't face her now.
After dinner comes the reckoning!
- Listen, who's that girl?
- I don't remember.
All right, I'll go. I may be lucky
and she will not see me today.
Good morning, Olenka.
I'm very glad you came yesterday.
I've been waiting for you.
To say thank you for the evening.
Yes, it was some evening all right.
- What are you plans for today?
- To have a rest after yesterday.
- Good morning, Verochka.
- Good morning, Yuri Grigorievich.
- Is she in?
- As always.
- A Swiss souvenir.
- No bribes.
What are your plans for tonight?
What company?
Will there be men?
Always invite me.
I am a single woman now.
Vera, please bring in the mail.
Here it is.
Wait here.
You know everything
about everybody.
That kind of a job.
What do you know
about Novoseltsev?
He's a loser.
A bachelor with two kids.
Have you been waiting long?
OK, I'll come later.
Do you remember
Liza Leontieva?
A pretty blonde...
...with a braid?
- She doesn't work here now.
- No, I can't remember.
Sure. So, she was his wife.
Gave birth to two kids...
...and then... went astray.
How could she leave the kids?
She's a mother!
Some mother!
Novoseltsev, he was their mother.
A quiet, gentle,
harmless person.
Never heard
a rough word from him.
Yes... harmless...
Novoseltsev, you're
up against the wall.
The crone's got interested in you.
She's studying your personal file.
I am being fired.
What for?
For hooliganism.
Vera, could you find out...
maybe she won't see me now?
OK. Wait here.
Novoseltsev is here.
I haven't called him.
OK, I'll tell him you're busy.
No... it will be tactless.
Tell him he may come in.
You must see her.
Must I?
How is she?
Break your leg.
Good morning,
Prokopia Ludmilovna...
I have come... I don't...
I have...
don't know why.... Yes.
Yesterday... a maggot bit me.
I noticed that.
Or I broke loose.
Very close to the truth.
So, I got loose...
like a cannon.
Sit down, comrade Novoseltsev.
Anatoly Efremovich.
Better die standing.
Sit down, don't be afraid.
Thank you.
Please be my guest.
Yesterday you...
Sit!..
...took the liberty of saying...
...I have nothing human in me.
You should not pay any attention
to what I was babbling yesterday.
Yes, I should! Why not?
You express the opinion...
... of a certain part of our staff.
Do I?
Yesterday you slandered me
in public.
Insulted me.
I did...
- Everything you said is a rank lie!
- A rank... lie.
- I totally disagree with you.
- And me... totally...
- Why do you weasel all the time?
- I don't weasel.
What kind of man are you?
I can't get the hang of you.
Don't hang me... Why?
- You said I am callous!
- No, you're tender.
- Inhuman!
- Human...
- Heartless!
- Heartful.
- Dry!
- Wet.
I am sorry,
Ludmila Prokofievna...
Stop... mocking me!
God forbid... It's not my intent...
I just... I don't....
I can't understand
why this word... 'wet'... I...
I was going to say... 'sweet',
Ludmila Prokofievna.
I can't see why you hate me so much,
in what way have I offended you?
I didn't do you out of your job.
No, you didn't.
- You were not laid off from your job.
- Not just yet.
You have been getting your bonuses...
I have... I... Ludmila Prokofievna...
I criticized your report, but then,
pardon me, I have the right to do it.
- I'm the director, as yet.
- We adore you...
We love you... Deep in our hearts.
Somewhere very, very deep.
- So deep I can't see it.
- No, you can. You should.
What is that nonsence
you're talking?
You're so democratic.
Yes, democratic.
Lying again!
Stop that now!
You can't even imagine...
When you summon us to your office...
- It's like a holiday!
- It's horrible!
What are you doing?
Are you crying?
Stop crying!
You can't do that, you're a director.
It's not for you to decide,
what I can do as a director.
I have superiors
to make such decisions.
Here, drink... water...
in a bottle.
- May I...
- Yura, wait outside... Get out.
- What's happening?
- We have a meeting!
- What's going on?
- She's firing him. For hooliganism.
Ludmila Prokofievna,
I have to talk to you.
- Later. Let us have our meeting.
- Stop ordering people around...
I am still the director here,
still the host... the hostess...
I'm afraid he's off his crust again.
What a rouser!
Stop blubbering, damn it!
I'm not a nanny
to look after you, am I?
I am not some garbage... either.
OK, go on crying.
It's good for you.
If you are able to cry,
not everything may have been lost.
Don't bother, I'll answer. Hallo!
Hallo! No, she's busy.
What minister?
Minister?
- She doesn't care for a minister.
- Give me the phone!
What have you done? How can you
talk to the management in such a way?
- Even I never presume to do that.
- Have some water, calm down.
Go on hiccuping.
Is it that everybody thinks
that I am a horrible monster...?
Don't exaggerate.
Not everybody. Not that horrible.
Jesus, that's impossible.
Go away! I don't want to see you,
nor listen to you.
Is Novoseltsev still there?
Just think of that:
they locked the door!
Maybe we should break in?
Are you nuts?
I assure you,
I meant no offence.
It's just that you started crying
as if you were normal. I was shocked.
I am so tired of you!
On my honour, you know... I...
I'm just tongue-tied... by nature.
Thinking is normal, typically,
but when I try to express it... I don't.
- All right, what did the minister say?
- Damn if I know.
I think he didn't understand me.
I am not used to talking to ministers.
Maybe he's calling me...
How can I see him now?
My eyes will be red all day.
And my nose too.
Only if you rub them. If you wait
till they're dry, nobody'll notice.
I haven't cried for so long.
Sometimes I'd just like to cry,
but what's the use of crying alone?
It's like a drunkard who cries...
that is, drinks... alone.
Next time you'd like to cry
call me to your office...
...we'll cry together.
Could you pour down
some water?
You're lucky, you've got your kids.
Yes, two. A boy and... a boy.
And I am all alone.
I get up in the morning,
I make coffee.
Not because I want it,
just because I have to.
I force myself to eat
and go to work.
This office, it's my home, actually.
And the evenings!..
If you only knew
how afraid I am of the evenings!
I stay late, till the guards
start locking the doors...
I pretend I have a lot to do...
actually, I just have nowhere to go.
Home... home, home, home!
Only TV waits for me.
You see, I can't even buy a dog
because there's nobody to walk it.
That's how it is.
Sure, I've got friends, but they all
have families, kids, homes of their own.
And I've made myself an old woman.
When I am only 36.
Why... 36?
Yes, I'm younger
than you, Anatoliy Efremovich.
And how old do I look like?
Well, thirty...
Five.
You're lying again,
comrade Novoseltsev.
It's just that the clothes
you wear are too dark. Lustreless.
I never noticed that.
50 kopecks and sign here.
It's an anniversary. Borovskiy's fifty.
So it's one copeck a year.
Pretty inexpensive. Sign here.
Anniversaries are out of fashion.
When you're 50,
we'll make a collection too.
I will not live to see it.
My job is too hazardous.
All right, Anatoly Efremovich,
go to your workplace.
I have a lot to do, really.
And then, I've got to find out
what the minister wanted.
Don't get angry.
Don't curse me.
You neither.
Don't blame me for being
so... cri-de-coeurish.
How was that, Tolya?
Novoseltsev!
50 kopecks!
Well, has the old crone
fired you?
She's not an old crone.
Why so long, Tolya?
I'll work a bit more.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Yura! Can I have a word with you?
Hallo, Olenka.
Can we meet tomorrow evening?
I can't. Tomorrow we are going
to see our relatives.
And the day after tomorrow?
My friend is having a birthday party.
And two days after tomorrow there's
a game on TV, isn't there?
It's hard to get out
during weekends...
But you understand...
OK, go. You've got to have a rest
from yesterday.
See you tomorrow.
May I, Ludmila Prokofievna?
Vera! Call the brightest mind...
...of our mutual times.
What do you mean, who?
Novoseltsev!
Please come in, comrade
Novoseltsev, have a seat.
Dear Anatoly Efremovich!
I would like to give you your due.
As they say, to each according
to his gifts, isn't it?
Strange as it may be, an idea has come
to our management, that is, to myself.
To appoint you, one of the leaders
of Soviet statistics...
...you can't deny it, ha-ha-ha...
...the Head of the
Light Industry Department.
The Lightest Industry Department.
What would be your answer,
Anatoly Efremovich?
Negative, Prokofia Ludmilovna.
I am inert, inefficient, and clumsy.
I am also shy, Ludmila Prokofievna.
I will screw up the operations of
the Light... Lightest Industry Dept.
Come in.
Thank you.
Don't be so shy, comrade Novoseltsev.
Thank you, Ludmila Prokofievna.
Have a seat.
Yes sir!
My name is Anatoly Efremovich.
I will try to remember that,
comrade Novoseltsev.
Is such a trifle worthy of remembering it,
comrade Ludmila Prokofievna?
It is, Novoseltsev, the more so because
I think that you're a most industrious...
Ho-ho...
No ho-hos,
an industrious... worker!
Well, Ludmila Prokofievna, you
will spoil me by saying that.
Everybody left, and you're still here...
like a fool.
I'm still here, as you have noted
rightly, like a fool...
...because you criticized my report.
And you were right criticizing it.
It does credit to you...
Your Modesty.
My modesty is nothing compared with your
inifinite insight, dearest Ludmila Prokofievna.
I am sorry.
Fine...
Excuse me...
Why? It's interesting.
And this chair fits you.
I am really sorry.
Take it back.
Why? You're comfortable there.
No, let us switch... vice versa.
But why do you think
I am a bad worker?
Why didn't you go home
with the rest of your colleagues?
Where has this zeal come from?
You said this: my report is bad.
So you came to my office, right?
A strange idea...
I thought you would help me...
me... to correct it.
Lying again.
You've stayed after hours
because you took pity on me.
In the morning, I was as week as to burst
into tears and talked too much.
And you... you believed me.
But I am fine. Absolutely fine.
It can't be better.
And it has nothing to do
with my personal life.
As if you had nothing but personal
life. There are many other things.
I manage a big organization. I love
my work. I am respected by many.
And feared by some.
By the way, I have just seen
the minister. He praised me.
So I need neither your compassion,
nor your protection.
I thought I saw real you
in the morning.
But it was a mistake.
You are real now.
All right, go home. Fast.
The kids are waiting for you.
Go, will you?
Nobody cares, and I'm racking my brains
about a present to Borovskikh.
I've found a bronze horse
in an antique shop.
Please let Novoseltsev help me
tomorrow, I will not cope with it.
There's no such thing as bad weather.
Each weather is Nature's grace.
Rain or snow, each season...
...should be accepted with gratitude.
Traces of rough weather in your soul...
A seal of solitude on your heart...
And grievous crops of insomnia...
...shold be accepted with gratitude.
Death of desires, years and misfortunes...
The burden is heavier with each day.
What nature has destined for you...
...should be accepted with gratitude.
Changing years, sunrises and sunsets...
And the grace of final love...
And the date of your departure...
...should be accepted with gratitude.
There's no such thing as bad weather.
You can't stop the passage of time.
The autumn of life,
as the autumn of a year...
Should be blessed without feeling sad.
Should be blessed without feeling sad.
Hallo, Verochka, may I?
Yes, do come in.
Could you give this letter
to Yuri Grigorievich?
OK.
As "Private and confidential".
Verochka, this is very urgent.
OK.
And don't forget it, please.
OK. It's my responsibility, after all.
And don't register it.
OK, I won't... register it.
Yura! Good morning!
Hallo, darling.
Good morning, Verochka!
- Morning.
- Is she in?
- As usual. You've got mail.
- Oh, a letter... thank you.
Vera, please come to my office.
I am here,
Ludmila Prokofievna.
I'd like to talk with you, Vera.
About what?
- Do sit down, please...
- I am all attention.
I need your... consultation.
Would you like to gather data
about somebody else?
Well... Not exactly...
To be brief...
What do people wear now?
- What do you mean?
- I mean clothes.
Why do you need this?
Oh, I'm sorry, Ludmila Prokofievna!
It's OK. A relative
has come to see me.
She lives in a small town
and... is interested.
I see. I see.
Let's start with the shoes.
Shoes make a woman a woman.
Is it so?
Shoeses now should be
high-heeled, and with a lappet.
What is "shoeses"?..
I don't know that.
It's from English "shoes".
Meaning footwear, in English.
I got it now...
As for boots, they should be
high-heeled and pleated.
Wait a minute, I have to
write it down. Not so fast.
OK, OK....
I'll make notes.
What should be pleated?
The heel?
The top.
Ah, yes...
Does your relative
have beautiful legs? Slender?
Legs... Just legs... Let's assume
they are standard.
OK, I see. So, bad legs
should be hidden.
Where?
Under a maxi!
Oh, you're a one, Zhora!
- What does that mean?
- Inventory check.
4322. Chair.
1315. Business souvenir.
- What's the matter, comrades?
3892. Table lamp.
- 113. Chair.
- Look, how good this lamp is.
- Comrades, wait a second...
- Conference table, 4308.
How dare you burst in?
We are fulfilling your order,
comrade director.
You are brain workers.
And so we are.
4264. Calculating machine.
Careful, please!
- Let's go to the conference room.
- Absolutely no tact.
- Vase, 1348.
- Let's go.
- Locusts! Highjackers!
1319. An ink set.
5869. "Moser" vase.
1314. Business gift: an airplane.
4319. Chair.
Zhora, what can this be?
- A rude word is written on it.
- Delete.
Another important factor
is combinatorics.
Meaning... matching things.
A sweater on top.
A slimline shirt.
Right now, they're up in the mall...
a blazer, maybe...
- What's a blazer?
- A blazer is a club jacket.
- For a House of Culture?
- ...For it, too.
A blazer, a shirt, but that's not
the main thing.
For example, wigs are not
in fashion now, then...
Thank Heaven. It is much better
without them, lively, isn't it?
A wig is... like a house on your head.
Well, if you want it lively, then yes.
What do we have if there are
no wigs? We have the face.
Now, eyebrows are
of collossal importance.
Since we are having
this discussion, I am sorry...
...but let's take your brows.
What about my brows?
They are just indecent.
If your brows are so thick...
...you have to do something
about them.
And what can be done
about them?
You have to pluck them.
Thin out.
With what?
For example, with a drawing pen.
A drawing pen?
But that will hurt!
And what of it?
You're a woman, have patience.
An eyebrow should be
thin as a thread...
...and raised in amazement.
Like yours?
Well, I'm not perfect either.
But that plucking...
...you'll need a lot of pain-killers.
That is still
not the main thing.
What is the difference between
a business woman and a... Woman?
What?
The walk!
Here. How do you walk?
How?
It's just unbelievable!
You would clot up, knot down,
curdle and turdle...
...like and old torn shoe,
and off she is, whooshing to work...
...as if she drives piles home!
Now, how do we walk?
My God, is this how I walk?
A woman should be a mystery.
The head is up, slightly.
The eyes are down, a bit.
Here, everything is relaxed.
Shoulders are drawn backwards.
The gait is free
and starts from the hip.
It's a loose relaxed posture
of a panther ready to attack.
Men can't miss such a woman.
Can one learn to walk like this
or is this... unachievable?
Even a hare can be
taught to smoke.
In principle,
nothing is impossible...
You think so?
...for people... having brains.
Get up.
Adjust your clothes.
I'm afraid I won't cope
with that science.
It's nothing,
you'll manage.
Don't be nervous.
Head, forward.
Breast, forward.
Breast? You flatter me, Vera!
Everybody flatters you.
Pull it up at the back.
Pull in the belly
from the front.
How? Either here...
or... or there...
Do as you are told:
everything in.
Everything in?
And advance freely.
Walk from the hip, relaxed! Go!
Ludmila Prokofievna, where have you
picked up this vulgarity?
You wiggle your hips like...
like a harlot.
- A beauty, isn't it?
- Nice horse.
This is no horse, it's some mammoth.
Can we come already?
- Who is it for?
- Borovskikh. He is 50.
Just don't say a word to him.
Where did you get the goose?
None there any more.
You're a woman,
and not a Marine sergeant.
I've forgotten how it is.
Add flavour, and make
your smile playful!
Let men think you're
absolutely OK.
Breathe. Be elegant.
Stop kicking out.
You are not a horse,
you're a woman.
And now alone!
Get up and go!
Cheer up!
Where are you going?
Allow us put this horse away,
behind the stage, in the closet.
Why... are you hiding it?
Why? For the birthday boy
not to see it.
So that he wouldn't be pleased
before his time.
All right, let's hide it.
Where can we hide it?
In the closet, behind the stage!
Yes... will it fit in?
We'll make it fit!
Shura, you're urgently needed
at the local committee!
Local committee! Novoseltsev,
hide the horse! Coming!
- You don't need me now, do you?
- No, Verochka, thank you.
- Come later, I'll sign everything.
- We'll sign, we'll talk, you're welcome!
What's that
you've been doing here?
Get the horse down.
It's not heavy, I am strong.
How was your evening yesterday?
Didn't you fall ill?
Why should I have fallen ill?
Do I look sick? I had a nice time
yesterday... in the evening.
A friend picked me up...
he's got a Volga car.
You say.
Where has he got the money?
Money is no problem for him.
He is a major aircraft designer.
We went to a restaurant.
Which restaurant?
Get the horse down, it's too heavy.
Have you frozen to it?
I am addicted to it.
Which restaurant?
We went to Aragvi.
We had dinner there. A feast.
Georgian quisine. Satsivi...
Sha... shashliks...
Georgian pies: chebureki.
Chebureki?
And what did you drink?
Drink? Khvanchkara,
Borzhomi water...
But you do not drink.
Why? I do. And how!
I never refuse good wine,
especially in good company.
Have you stuck to the horse?
Get it down. You'll burst.
I won't. It's a small
horse. It's a pony.
And what happened
after the dinner?
You go too far,
comrade Novoseltsev!
Put the horse down, you look
like a family reunion.
I love animals.
And how was your... evening?
It was quiet. I took
a trolley bus home...
...helped the older son
with his lessons...
...played with the younger one.
And then my wife
announced dinner.
She's Lisa, right?
Let me help you.
A blonde, with a braid?
Yes, a blonde, with a braid.
- Is this your previous wife?
- No, consequent one.
You've got no wife, and I know that.
Why are you lying all the time?
I follow your example.
I know that you've got
no aircraft designer.
Why is this familiarity?
Who gave you the right
to talk this way to your director?
Why have you
thrown the horse?
Why are you
lying down... with it?
We are not lying down.
We have fallen.
Have you fallen down?
Yes, from the horse.
Stop shamming!
We... we feel bad.
You're pretending!
No, I am not.
Kindly get up and away,
together with the horse.
It'll hurt us to get up.
We've got a bump here.
A bump?
Put something cold on it.
We've got a labour accident.
You've got no bump.
It will rise.
If you say so, than you need...
something cold.
Why are you
treating me yourself?
Assign this task
to your secretary.
When will you stop seeing me
only as your director?
Can you imagine that?
Bublikov died.
How is it, died? I have not
ordered... Why... died?
What for?
I have not found it out yet.
A collection
for the funeral wreath.
How much?
50 kopecks. For the wreath
and the orchestra.
Another death or birth today,
and I'll have no lunch.
Sign here!
Wait a minute,
I'm your director still!
Yes, according to seniority...
Novoseltsev!
Put the horse in the closet!
Nice time to be having rest!
We didn't make it to the closet.
So how are you?
Do you feel... better... there?
There... No.
What have you got there?
A bump?
No. No bump. You're all right.
Get up. Should I help you?
Get up, at last! Get up
and get down... to your work.
My horse and I are sorry
that we... you...
Are you all right, Anatoly Efremovich?
How do you feel?
To tell you the truth, not bad,
compared with Bublikov.
And get along with you... then.
- Hi.
- Hallo.
You've become a regular here.
Implementing my plan?
No, my horse and I were engaged in
social activities. Falling down.
Yura, haven't you discussed
my appointment yet?
See, I have had no opportunity yet...
I will talk to her, by all means.
Please don't. Let it stay as it is.
I don't want this position.
You're strange, aren't you?
Verochka, if Ludmila Prokofievna
asks, I am at the ministry.
OK.
Keep hold of your chair,
not to fall down.
Ryzhova, she sits next to you...
A dyed blonde, always running
around with bags.
Turn your head back!
There she is... in ugly roses.
She passed me a letter
for Samokhvalov. I saw it by chance.
Sure, you can't read
other people's letters.
But I started to read
and couldn't stop. Listen.
Dear Yura! I hesitated
long before I wrote this... bla-bla...
Women nearing forty
often make silly things.
She knows better, I'm sure...
I understand that you
don't need all this... 
I know... when I saw you
I understood...
...that I may have loved
only you all these years.
Here we are.
The pension's on the horizon,
what does she think about!?
It's a sexual revolution!
Have you ever heard
anything like that?
She must have gone crazy...
I beg you, don't tell
anything to anybody.
