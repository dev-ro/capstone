- Hi, What's up?
- Hello

- Fine
Didn't Kuttachan come?
No. Grand Dad is alone at home
Dad won't go anywhere without
him They always stick to each other
Is it so?
One minute
- It's time. Come out
- Okay
How was the journey?
It was fine
- Are you done with your exams?
- Yes
Alright
Come
Why are you silent?
Tensed?
No, she is alright
Come over
- Shall I call the Priest?
- Yes

Jojo alias Thomas
Based on the consent of God...
and the laws of the Church...
as you enter into the
covenant of Holy Matrimony...
When the priest asks her if
she is willing to marry him...
She will say no
From this day forward?
I do
Merin...
Based on the consent of
God and the laws of the Church
Through the covenant
of Holy Matrimony...
Do you declare your
consent to take Thomas...
As your lawful husband?
I do
You all are witness
to this agreement
May the Lord in His kindness
strengthen the consent...
you have declared
before the Church
Can't you behave yourself?
When I thought of mom and dad...
I didn't get the strength
Why are you both sitting here?
They all are getting ready to leave
They asked for you
Come
Merin is not ready for marriage
She wants to study...
Get a job...
She has a lot of dreams
We are here to take care of her
What a thing to say after the Betrothal!
Didn't I tell you this before?
How many times did I tell you!
What's happening here?
You all may be having some gain
Stanley uncle, dad and all
No one cares about Merin
This is a crime
What's the crime here?
Getting her married?
Everything will be
alright after the marriage
Is this how you get her married?
This is nothing but crime!
And you all are part of it!
- Leaving already?
- Yes
Why don't you leave tomorrow?
We are planning
to go hunting tonight
I have some urgent work there
Won't you come for the
wedding in December?
- Let's see then.
- Alright then
Okay
Okay, bye
Keep this closed
Should we go tonight?
There will be a lot of moonlight
We may not be
able to hunt anything.
Why?
That's not a problem at all
Didn't you know? Stanley
works as a safari hunter
Hunting is a job?
Wealthy people are allowed to
hunt lion, tiger, deer, and everything
It's legal there
Please move a bit
They have loads of money
But have no idea about hunting
That's where we come in
We hunt lions, and tigers...
they click a photo with it...
take credit and leave home happy
He is in a good position
And a UK green card holder
Such a nice family too!
Great Grandpa must be happy
Just imagine if you said
'no' in the church today...
What would have
happened to our family now?
All big expenses should be taken
care of when great grandpa is alive
All your education, marriage...
everything for the three of you
If great grandpa dies without
writing a will in our favour
There are many heirs to claim a share
Family group is full of
wishes for the betrothal
Why are all our family
members abroad!
No one likes India
Why are you here now?
What!
Why not!
They are all celebrating
Are you both going to tuck into bed?
Come...
Come, let's celebrate
Come on, get up
So many marriages have
been called off after betrothal
Right Mumma?
Don't make me start
Come...
Zimbabwe has the world's second-largest
elephant population after Botswana
Our place
There was a tusker
Many tried to take him
down. But, they couldn't
Once, I got him standing
right in front of me on top of a hill
Then...
I got him point blank
I even have the photographs.
Didn't I show them to you?
Show it to me
Oh! You got the guitar!
I was about to ask you
Grandpa, you know what that means?
Only I can read your mind
You are my sweetheart
Merin sings well too
Oh!
Even Linda sings beautifully
But she knows only church songs
That's because you don't
like her singing other songs
It's okay when other women
make TikTok and Insta Reels
But, I won't like it if my wife makes it
Sister-in-law, why
don't you sing for us?
You aren't making tik tok here
Brother-in-law is fine with it
No no. I can't... Mini will sing.
Can anyone please sing?
They want to go hunting
Who?
- Stanley?
- Yes, Stanley
- Else, I will sing
- Please don't, Papa
Grandpa loves wild meat
But Baby is not
too keen on hunting
It's just that I don't eat
I don't hunt Bison
and those big animals
- It's a lot of meat
- Yes
We can't even distribute it
Throwing it to waste
is heartbreaking
Will forest officials
come hearing gunshots?
My dear brother in
law, it's 450 acres
No one's going to reach us
Then, why worry!
Take him away!
Here is Great
Grandpa's favorite song
- Is it yours, Baby?
- Yes
- Hunting dog?
- Yes
I will take leave then
I will come around 10 PM
Okay
♪ These nights, this weather, this
river bank, this gentle breeze... ♪
Basil
Does Merin have any
problem with this marriage?
She doesn't want to go abroad
Also, he is not a
good match for her
I don't understand why you
have children in the first place
What did we do?
Usually all fathers have an ownership
mentality towards their children
Ownership mentality?
I never asked you to respond
to me saying Yes, your honor
I taught you to
call me Dad, right?
You haven't understood
Then make me understand
Parents have this stubbornness...
That their children should
live only according to their wish
Children should
choose a job they like...
marry a partner they choose
Everything according to their wish
That's ownership
mentality. Get it now?
I let you study Economics when
you showed interest in it, Right?
- Hmm
- Right?
I'm not that
educated or anything
Now you go to Kattappana or
America or wherever and study...
and buy a bottle of Jonniee
Walker and give it to me
Then you play dad
Until then, let me be the dad
Okay?
You think Jonniee Walker
is the best in the world
You will change only
when you think otherwise
Talk to me in a
language I understand
Hey
Your well educated son has
become a Communist now
Blame the books and
the movies he watches!
He has become spoiled
If he's spoiled, he's my
son. If he's good, he's yours!
Mom, Moly is always
playing with her phone
She is using my
Instagram to do reels
Don't blame me if she
does anything wrong
Didn't you show her all that?
- Me?
- Go, check on her
Vellayan...
Eat
I'm going to take a nap
- Wake me up at 10
- Okay
Hey, Sachi
- Grandpa, I got some porridge for you
- Sure
Glass...
Good you brought this
He has been asking
for this for a while now
Listen
We are going hunting tonight
Dad asked you and
your dad to get ready
Do you have online
class tomorrow?
Yes, but it's in the
afternoon. No problem
Still watching
TV? It's 10 already
Come... let's go to bed
Granny, give it to me
- No, I won't
- Give me
Give me
Where did you keep the remote?
You come and sleep now
- Dad
- Yes
It's 10 o'clock
Give some here
Aren't you coming?
No, I am sleepy
Is this a local gun?
Yes
Show me
It's loaded, can't change hands
Are there believes like that?
We pray and load it
Praying to get the best prey?
We're going into the forest, isn't it?
Shouldn't we pray to protect us all
Did you move to
Zimbabwe after marriage?
Yes, I went there after my
graduation... I was around 22
I was crazy about hunting
I see
My grandpa was a good hunter
Dad was not too keen
Why do Forest officials create a
problem for hunting wild boars?
It's not like they're going extinct
They are everywhere
and breed like crazy
Oh! Don't even get me started
We can hunt those
which destroy our crops
But, report it and burn
it in front of the officials
They won't let us eat it
Then what's the point?
Yeah. So no one
tries to take the trouble
Take that knife, it's in the back
- Okay
- Sachi, take it
Why didn't you plant here?
It's called 'Devil's Hill'
Workers don't come here
Why?
Not sure. It's been like this
So it's because workers don't enter
This is the State border
Forest border is far from here...
If Revenue department get
to know, won't they show up?
I don't think so.
Won't be much of use to them
They can't cut the
trees or build anything
Look here, Bison's footprints
Yeah?
There are leopards too
They jump from trees
onto back of our necks
There are no leopards
here... But there are tigers
We got to know about the tiger only
after the encounter 2 years back...
...we might find a leopard too
It's the western ghats
All animals will be there
Boar has to turn around
Here, shoot it
Hey, don't!!
Sachi, give a hand
Didn't you know, the
boar will charge at us?
I thought you will
shoot before that
Get it ready
[Crowd chattering]
[Crowd chattering]
Kids, eat your breakfast
[Crowd chattering]
Balance is Rs.32
32
We are just 30 people
Okay
For 'kavathu' work?
Why, people are less?
- Is Shini taking care of plucking, Suja?
- Yes
- How many of them?
- 33
[Crowd chattering]
Lijo?
20?
Working inside Kattadi woods?
- Ok then, see you later
- Keep moving
Make it fast
Keep moving
Go ahead, fast
Prajeesh, why is the
work still not over?
We are not paying you any less
Why is it different for me?
You pay everyone the same
There are 4 other overseers here
It's not just me
Then the work has
to get over in time
We can't force
anyone to work harder
We need to take care
of them the right way
Are you showing off your
power as the Union member?
Is it so?
I am also a Union
member. I know it too.
From childhood I have lived in this
settlement and worked here like you
What's wrong?
He is teaching me my job
As if I don't understand
what's going on
Prajeesh, you can go
Leave it, Baby
Why is it too slow? Get going
Take everything and leave
I will go home and from
there to the plantation
Yeah, I will go there
You are sitting here?
I have been searching for you
What a great visual to
witness in the morning!
What?
People from Jharkhand, Assam, Tamil Nadu,
what not! More than 200 odd people, right?
Is this your first time?
Haven't you seen this before?
This is quite a different mood
A deep forest and an estate, where
even a gunshot won't be heard outside
By the way, the documents
are only for 200 acres
And these kind of landlords
won't die without writing a will
Mom says Grandpa might
write everything on dad's name
Anyway, thanks to Corona
Else, staying like this
would have been quite tricky
Where to?
To the plantations. Coming?
No
Come let's have breakfast
Have your guests left?
Rimi aunty and uncle would
be home for a few more days
They still don't have kids, right?
Rimi aunty isn't
interested in raising kids
So, they decided not to
Are you going to IT park?
- Yes, coming?
- Yes
Granny, am going with them
Is it called IT Park now?
That's what Basil calls it
Baby
Yes
Tell them to distill
some arrack for me
Sure
Branded liquor doesn't
excite me these days
Will get it done
Will there be a hike in cardamom
rates if we store it for some more time?
Today's rate is 1150
8 plus's rate is 1600
Looking at today's
situation, the price is still high
I don't think it will go up soon
Chances of a drop is there
Andhra and North India are getting
imports from Guatemala (Spain)
They had a good harvest
We can't sell at their rates
considering our labour costs
Dad, here is the accounts
How will be our yield for
the next two months, Baby?
We have quite good yield
So are others
I had checked with
Maria Estate as well
Sarath has got a
good yield this time
- Hi Baby
- Hi
Is the 'koppadi' job
done in both valleys?
Yes, it's done
I have shared a
song with you. Check
Is it your Russian band again?
No, this is Jamaican
Hey, Sachi
Shall we go to Devil's hill on
the morning of 'Aadi' festival?
Make sure nobody finds out
I heard you. I'll tell Dad
If you do, I will unfriend you
I heard it too
Mini, can't come
along. It's a dense forest
Why? Is the forest
dense just for me?
I will come along. Merin too
What if we're not going then?
No one is going
anywhere without me
It takes a full day
Won't they find out if
you both are not seen?
Then I'll come alone
Alright.
- You get lost.
- Basil...
You are silly! I have
my Basil to take me
Online class is
over. You carry on
- Are you going to town?
- Yes
Then I want you to
buy something for me
- I will Whatsapp you
- Okay
Did you catch any fish?
Look inside the bucket
Look here
This won't export as
first grade, take care
Is it all only 'kotta?'
Yes. It is only 'kotta'
Jomon
[Ok No no... I will surely
meet you in the evening]
Baby, come here for a minute
I need some cash urgently
If I can take some
cardamom from this...
we can solve it without
Grandpa knowing
What is this, Jomon?
Please don't lower
yourself in front of me
Is it about Varkey?
Yes
I can't even go to the club
Whatever it is, won't
Grandpa solve it for you?
Ya, right! He will!
Why would I tell you if I can
get it solved with grandpa?
What's this now?
Where did you get this from?
From Munnar
Just got it delivered
Can't ride this on the public road
Right
I took this for two months
Great! So, you are sorted
for the next two months
What else do we do during Covid?
Thought I'd explore the forest
Baby should help me okay?
Of course! Let's do it one day
Meet you in the evening
[crowd chattering]
See this is sold for 940 rupees...
Good price right...?
Hey... come on Jomon
Baby...
how's our sir Pappy's health?
Now he's improved a lot
in speaking and all is better.
I suppose he has six heirs
Will they manage this
after Sir Pappy's demise...
Will they manage this after Sir Pappy's demise...
or sell the plantation?
When they plan to sell it, tell me first
when they plan to sell it, tell me first
we'll work out a price
after Sir Pappy's demise, right?
- After Sir Pappy's demise, right?
- Yes
I'll see
Okay
I'll see you
60 Tons...
60 Tons...
72 million rupees
Keep the token
Why... you giving me?
Hey Jomon, don't be silly
Set
Oh!
What now?
We need to start
doing promotions now
We get 'promotions' on Instagram?
What a lame joke
Good morning!
Good morning!
Why has Stanley rented a bike?
He said he wants to look
around our estate and the forest
What is that boy doing inside?
They are doing some
internet marketing business
Green Earth
I had told you about it
It's in profit
Let Jomon stay back
You go deal with it
- Oh! is that fine?
- Yes
What's his name?
Varkey
I will go change and come
This is some local Arrack
It's gambling debt right?
How's it fair to increase
interest on that?
My boss is proposing a fair deal
He has added a fair interest...
and settling the dues fully
Shouldn't you respect that?
I am aware of the
Thiruvachola family stature
But those days are long gone
Oh! I didn't know
Only you and Thiruvachola
Pappi aren't aware of this
That's why I mentioned
Sorry?
It is Thiruvacholayil
Pappi Yohannan
Or Pappi Mappila
His naming ceremony was
not done on your lap, right?
He is 89 years old
But one spit and you'll fly off
Ya, right!
Your masters spit will fly
and maybe his teeth too
In that case, let's settle
their dues with interest
Go for it
Kuttachan sir...
We are not talking
about peanuts here
This is about money. Settle it first
Hold him
Yes
Where have you reached, Chacko?
Almost here?
What happened, Sir?
Nothing happened
Michael, just close
the door from outside
- I have informed the police
- Okay Sir
Total amount is Rs.530
Rs.530
So, 938 remaining
I have got some workers
from outside this time
I need to get the
transportation fare
You need to handle
all that from your money
I had informed
the landlord as well
- Then you ask him for the money
- Here it is. 60
Sir, for Monday, it is 25.
- 25
- 30 on Tuesday
Raniamma, your son is married now
Happy and settled?
- Isn't it 800 rupees?
- Yes, it is
Raniamma gets 1200 for 6 days
I saw your Insta post
- Wasn't it good?
- Yes
- Did you see mine?
- I did
It was all muddy
Maina, let's go home
Who is that girl?
She stays in our settlement on top
Topmost?
No, the cottage that comes
first when you climb up
What's her name?
Maina
Yeah that's enough
Just the last portion
Hello
Hey! Mini. Were you around?
Yes, how have you been?
All good
Let me get going then
We have a celebration on Monday
Aadi Perukku festival
Need to get new
dresses for all our workers
Get me a cover
Open the cover properly
Give me
You do this
Don't sit idle
It's time for me to
go. Isn't it ready yet?
Almost ready
Is this what she does all the time?
I came inside so that
I don't disturb them
Oh Princess kunjilakshmi,
there are 136 plantations here...
Kochazhaka Kochazhaka' [a folk song]
Baby! You spoiled it
Now, she has to start over
I've been singing
this for so long
- What's your problem, Baby?
- Oh! Come on!
As if the only thing left
at this age is to go viral
Come, let's do it tomorrow
Pestering people for no reason
And finding pleasure in it
Why is me joking
around such a big deal?
Won't you get angry if I interrupt you
while you're in the middle of something?
Yes, obviously
She got angry at me too, right?
Buzz off!
You always find
ways to justify yourself
That's your thing!
Basil is right
You do show off
in front of the kids
Some kind of dominance
Yes, I do
I have the right to be so
Do you want to see it?
So daring?
Are you taking the jeep
to the estate or should I?
I'll go, mom
Won't it be hard to
drive for you at this age?
What are you doing?
Go, sit in the front
Go ahead
Where are you going?
Come here for a sec
All set, Baby?
Yes, all set. Come get in
I'll go tell mom and come
If you ask her once, then
you will have to ask every time
So don't give a chance to say no
Look there...
Dense fog on the sky
scrapper's devil's hill
What skyscrapers?
Is Baby scared of the devil?
What?
Are you scared of the devil?
No. But I'm a little
scared of you guys
Three people are walking in a line...
...behind one another
The first person said that
two people are behind him
The second person said he
has one person behind him
Third person also said
he is followed by two
Why do you think so?
Are they standing in a circle?
The third person was lying
Such a poor joke!
[They have brought
new clothes for us]
[Are you going to the shop?]
- [Ok, get going]
- [Okay]
- Basil
- Yeah?
Come here
- Come this side
- You come here
- It's full of water there
- Come
Aren't you studying Economics?
Yes.
Didn't I tell you he's
studying Economics
- Nothing, I just asked
- Maina
Yes, coming
Let me get going then
How long have you
been washing? Come fast
- Aren't you coming?
- Yes
Do you want a bubble gum?
Here
- Mini
- Yes
Why are you gloomy?
Nothing
I am going down
Take this, it's also
for cottages down
Watch it
[crowd chattering]
[crowd chattering]
[crowd chattering]
Come
Careful
Let's sit for a while
Didn't I tell you this is not for you?
Sachi
Blessy
Yes
Get me that plier
I am busy writing
Don't disturb me
Sorry dear
- Suja
- Yes
Are you free?
What do you want?
Can you give me a hand?
I have other things to do
You seem to be busy
Where is Mini?
I haven't seen her since morning
True. I haven't
seen Basil as well
Didn't he come for lunch?
No, he didn't
I am not studying
Then, are you writing
a story from TV?
They have gone to Devil's Hill
If I tell someone, he
said he'd unfriend me
- Don't tell anyone, Okay?
- Yes
[I am still laughing
thinking about it]
[Not funny]
Where were you all?
Missing since morning
We went to Devil's Hill
Devil's Hill?
Aren't we back safe?
Now it's okay to tell Merin
Come
We are off
Okay
What are you going to tell at home?
I'll tell that I was
with my friends
What about for lunch?
I'll tell that I was there and
no one was in the kitchen
Grandma, get me Vellayan's food
Basil
Come here
Why did you take Mini and
the others to Devil's Hill?
What if something goes wrong?
Things can go wrong anywhere
Need not be in the jungle
Look at the arrogance!
How do I tell her not to
come when she wants to?
Isn't it up to her?
Why are you worried
about grandpa's will?
We've been taking
care of everything here...
and yet we've got nothing
So, what do I do?
Ya, We got dowry
But, whom do I go to
when I am in trouble?
Leave it
We need to discuss this only if
Grandpa writes his will in Dad's name?
Who will tell Grandpa about this?
Only dad can talk to him
How can Kuttachan ask Grandpa
to write everything in his own name?
He definitely won't
- Mini
- Yes
Where were you during lunch?
I had come for lunch
Anyway, it was only dry fish curry
If you can't tell grandpa, then I can
You just need to put
me in the right situation
It's already very late
Dad is tired after
the day's work
Go and sleep
Shall we call it a day?
- Okay
- Get up
Get up
Suja, come. Let's go sleep at 'Appupan's'
Blessy, go with Dad
I'll go with him
Why don't you get it?
What if Appuppan falls ill
at wee hours like last time?
It's a full moon day too
How can Blessy help?
Why can't you listen to him?
Just go with him
Come. Take the blanket too
Calendar doesn't
say it's full moon
What do you know
about full moon?
Calendar will say a lot of nonsense
Oh dear Suja, just go with him
As if you made
an intelligent plan
Mom understood everything
No way
Does she understand how
this weather makes us feel?
Shower me with love
only when you need me!
Why?
What's wrong with my love?
I have a feeling that
Mini and Basil are in love
No way!
They are childhood friends
- It can't be love
- May be
Must be the wrong
thought from an old timer
I don't think so
I guess I'm not an old timer then
But, do keep an eye on them
And tell me if you feel the same
We need to clear the path a bit
We are talking about
3 long kilometers
How do we manage to
climb up with these people?
It's not that easy
We can't manage this alone
Let's get some workers to help
Shouldn't we pay them?
This comes to 25,148 rupees
Shall we just name it
Devil's Hill Trekking?
Appupa, why is it called Devil's Hill?
No one should go up there
That's why it is called so
Why do you care?
Are you guys planning
something on the Devil's Hill?
That viewpoint... where
you took me long back
Yes
We are planning a short trekking
Start in the morning
and return by evening
Small beginning of our project
Did you take permission
from the landlord?
Why should we?
Isn't it a no man's land?
No, you should tell the landlord
You can't go there otherwise
Won't you need to
cross his plantation?
There is another way too
Not just that.
He might want a
share if he gets to know
Then we'll just be their workers
Who are your partners?
Me, Mini and Sachi
You won't partner with Mini
Especially without
the landlord knowing
You have to tell him.
Else, don't go
How can I pull Mini out?
We planned it together
Mini shouldn't be
part of it. It's final
Why are you scowling?
If you want to do it without
my permission, go ahead
You are hopeless, Dad
What happened?
What's wrong?
Mini, for couple of days...
...no, keep yourself away
from our Devil's Hill plan
Why?
Dad said if you are involved, we must
get your great grandpa's permission
But, how did Baby get to know?
It slipped out of my tongue
How could you...
I kept it a secret at home
when we went for the trek
Don't even think about
doing this without me
This is nonsense!
- Basil
- Yes
We are here to collect the kit
Hey, just give it to them
- Coffee?
- No
Happy?
Try searching
'Frankincense' on Amazon
It costs 350 for 250 grams
Isn't that the bike from
the movie, 'Vishwasam'?
Yes
All terrain vehicle
It can climb up any
forest and mountain
Shall we leave?
Yes
Pick them and put it inside
Pull
Where are you roaming
around when you're sick?
I am alright
Alright?
- What's that?
- Frankincense
Keep it in the vehicle.
I am going there
No fever, is it?
Come, check
It's hot
There is slight temperature
- Do you have coffee with you?
- Yes
Give him a cup
Baby sir!
Come when you are done
You are out
No I'm not
It's been two times already.
Let me play
- Do you want to try?
- No
You don't even know the game
- Done?
- Yes
I will just come
Basil...
Where are you taking this?
To give them
- Do you have temperature?
- I am fine
Here is some
Frankincense. It's quite old
Baby, the BP medicines are over
Ajayan will bring
them when he comes
Shall I go then?
Baby
Let's clear the forest and plant
cardamom in the 10 acres, as planned?
Yes, will do it
It might need a manpower
of 50 people for 2 months
Why so?
Can't we get it done
faster with more workers?
That won't help
Workers are not the same anymore
Increasing the number won't help
We won't know
what's happening too
Don't increase the workforce
Okay
Let's get it done slowly
Okay
We can also plant
some pepper wine
No one is investing on it
as the price is going down
Going forward, the
demand might go up
Okay
Why are you gloomy?
Why did you do that today, Dad?
Why did you give them the
Frankincense we collected?
What about our effort then?
What else should I have done?
You got it it from his jungle!
Workers often take it
You didn't have to give it to them
We took it from the jungle. What makes
you think the landlord has rights over that?
Doesn't he take
care of all our needs?
What's your problem then?
You justify every act of theirs
For generations, you are
contented with what you get
Yes, that's enough for me
You need to be satisfied
with what you have
You are not going to change
Hey!
What happened?
Slight fever
Not too high
Mini
He has temperature
Don't sit with him
What if it's Covid?
You go home now.
He looks fine.
The symptoms are
different for different people
You go home. Carry on
You come and sit inside
Don't interact much
Let's get tested first
You go home
Why are you so paranoid, Baby?
They shouldn't be
making any plans together
I won't let this trekking and all
happen. I'll make sure it ends here
Then ask him whether
he is in love with her
It's Mini who is
in love with him
Should I ask him
and let him know too?
Then, talk to the landlord
Let them talk to her
Suja, no one should
know about this
Not even mom
There's a story about
landlord's younger daughter...
Rahel who joined the convent
The story behind Devil's Hill
Just pray that he's COVID positive
Yesterday I lost it with Dad
He must have felt bad
That's why I agreed to
come to the COVID centre
Test came negative
So I can come out soon
- [Who is it?]
- [Mini]
Only antigen has
come out negative
RT-PCR will take 2-3 days more
So we'll know for
sure only after that
I am totally fine
Don't even have a cough
Basil got COVID, is it?
Test has come out negative
He doesn't have Covid
How's the food there?
Food is awesome.
This is paid quarantine
Dad is playing the money game
Took a room for your comfort
Now you are making fun of it
Oh! Baby
He's in violence mode. See
- Look at him
- Yes, I am
You kids don't know the
seriousness of COVID
That burnt chicken you made!
Who eats that?
Come on!
Look...
I don't think he's coming
back any time soon
He's too happy there
Dad
Yeah
Take enough rest
You take a trek to
the jungle with the kids
Collect some
frankincense and wild honey
That's enough to
kick start our project
Can't we do all that
when you're back?
We got a couple of
inquiries on our post
Did you see?
Yeah I checked...
But it's only four, right?
They didn't seem serious
Don't you have anything
else to talk about?
I'm feeling a little
low after Dad left
I am coming here
for the first time
This 500 acres of
land has 5 hills...
and one of them is untouched
Do you know at least that?
What route are you taking?
The bike won't get through
It will
Are you taking me to kill?
Yeah, I am going to kill you
What?
There are so many
animals here for us to kill
Let's walk the rest
Where are we going Stanley?
I didn't pay so much
attention to the route...
when I came following those kids
But don't worry
We will get there
It's the right direction
The Devil's Hill view point!
200 acres of no man's land
A piece of Western Ghats
Deer, sambur, gaur, wild squirrel...
Wow!
Just hunt a gaur and get 1.5-2 lakhs
All we need to do is
wait with a loaded rifle
We needn't wait for your
Grandpa's charity for that
But, if we manage to get
10 acres land around this...
this will be a treasure valley
I have a doubt...
Mini and Basil may be in love
Really?
Now that's funny
Shall we tell Grandpa?
Only to him?
They're in love, Grandpa
This tusk is from an
elephant Grandpa shot down
Yes, I know. I've
seen the photograph
No one should know about this
Now you can go
What is it?
What does she want, Dad?
[What is it?]
Come in
Come
Sit down
Sit down
What are the kids
doing in Devil's Hill?
They're claiming that they can trek up
to Bogey Hill without entering the estate
I see
I've asked them not to do
anything without your permission
They're educated kids right?
So we can't argue and win
Do you know that
they're in love?
Baby...
Your family has been with us...
for generations
Your forefathers stood by us
when we made all this fortune
Forever that was our strength
But however good a tree is...
if it leans on to your roof
Do you have any other
choice but to cut it down
Do you have?
No
Kids are smart
I thought of separating them
But that's no good
...there's no other way
there's no way
Is there?
No...
Right?
There is only one way
Your son... we don't
need him anymore
Baby
What happened to you?
Has he smoked up?
I think he smoked
weed by mistake
That's unusual
What to do!
Back then this place
was a dense forest
Elephants were causing nuisance
An elephant trampled our Karuppan
We thought he would die
But it's Kannan Devan's
treatment that saved his life
Is Kannan Devan Appupan a doctor?
He's a Vaidyar (tribal physician)
Grandpa shot the elephant
down because it hit Karuppan?
That was a violent elephant
Grandma... what about the tusk?
The tusk was
here for a long time
But when the new law came in...
Landlord took it
and hid it somewhere
the next year landlord died
Then Thiruvachola
family bought the estate
The tusk was lost since
Thanks
Okay
You reached so early?
They asked me to leave after
noon. But I didn't wait that long
- Basil
- Is the house locked?
The fever has gone down, right?
Yes
It's not locked
- Moly is there
- What?
Moly is there. You go
Okay
Are you playing games?
Where did Blessy
go without her phone?
Must be here somewhere
You always play Bubble
I will show you another game
It's called Brain Out
What's wrong?
- Were you comfortable there?
- Yes
What happened Dad?
Nothing. Just a bit tired
Hey! When did you come?
Just now
What's up with the guitar?
I wanted Blessy's
help to shoot a reel
Where is she?
Must be somewhere there
Shall I do it for you?
Okay
Which song?
It's an old song
Let's do it
See you
Okay
Dad?
Are you in love with Mini?
What are you talking about?
We're best friends, Dad!

Merin...
Merin...
Merin... wake up
Merin...
What is it?
Song...
I can hear a song
At night?
Come...
What is it?
Hey...
Tell me
Love
What?
It's something like a pain here...
But there's no pain
It's weird.
I can hear songs and all.
Songs?
Yeah!
Have you lost it?
I'm also doubting the same.
This is a weird felling...
The whole day I
tried to tell Basil.
But I just couldn't
Basil?
Are you seriously
planning on telling him?
Have you thought
how mom will react?
Then what should I do?
It's not something that
come and go as I please
This is a weird felling
Sometimes I hear romantic
songs playing in my head
Which one is it now?
Kadhal Rojave...
Is this supposed to be funny?
I am not enjoying this
Aren't you scared?
It's an interesting twist anyway
Don't tell anyone
Why are you sitting in the dark?
Dark?!
You're able to see us right?
I can see even in the dark
I got this after keeping
myself awake for so long
Buggers have to show up
Aren't you sleepy?
Going in
- Basil?
- Yes
- Who is that?
- It's Vanarajan Uncle
- What's up?
- All good
What's with this big pot?
Come... I'll show
Is that beef?
These are things
for a Malabar Biryani
Keep it in the kitchen
Give him a hand
What are you looking at?
Oh! It's a surprise visit
I wanted to give this to you
What is this?
Now you have to keep this safe
We've been Christians since
the time Grandpa converted...
how can we keep this at home?
What made you and your
son come to check on us...
when Sivakumar passed away?
That too during lockdown
Blood relation!
But with all these rituals...
Nothing like that
You just need to take it to
the temple during the festival
They will do the pooja
and give it back to you
Just guard it
Sivakumar doesn't
have any male heirs
So only you and your son
have the right to keep it now
- Right, Grandmom?
- He is right
You have to accept it
It's Baby's now
Moly, pass it over
Basil...
Get that plate
Doesn't granny need?
Blessy, take it
Let's stand here
Dad, I'm going to the
town to buy a pen drive
- No, I'll go in the evening
- I'll quickly go and come
No, come with me
Get down, asshole
Baby Sir
Why did you call me an asshole?
Is that a big problem now?
Your careless work destroyed 3 plants
Just 3 plants from this 500 acres?
Move this side
Move
What is it?
He called me an asshole
You leave. We will handle this
Keep your weapons down and leave
I said leave, assholes!
What are you trying
to do with your 2 knives
Stop showing off and leave
Dad, what happened to you?
You seem to be overly protective
of me for the last few days
I know Mini is your best friend
Yes
But, do you know that
she is in love with you?
What are you talking about?
She is in love with you
Who is making these things up?
Landlord is asking
us to leave this place
Go where?
Why should we leave if he says so?
Where should we go?
Do you know any other job?
They can't drive us out of here
How can you say all this?
Your name is O.Baby
Our family name is Othayoth
Thiruvachola came here long afterwards
They might even kill us
Did we all do this for
them to kill us one day?
Your great grandpa wants
all of us to leave everything
And disown this place
Why?
They're saying that
you're in love with me
Is it true?
Yes
Leave all that
You are not going anywhere
Even our plans with
Devil's Hill will happen
How did Great Grandpa
get to know this?
I have no idea
What do we do now?
It's done. Shall I
get you some more?
No
Great Grandpa...
I am not in love with Basil
Then why are you
asking Baby to leave?
Who told you all this?
Is it Baby?
Basil
Kuttachan will tell him
You go now
Great Grandpa is not going
to be here for long, Right?
How many ponds the
Crane has seen! Right, dad?
I waited from 12 to 3
to get a hold of them
Give me a peg
I got it spot on
Baby?
It's getting ready
I think that's enough
Okay
- Bread?
- No
Where are you
planning to run away to?
[Baby?]
What else do I do?
[Get me that tomato]
Serve her tomato
Cheers
Cheers
What Dad meant... was
not for you to relocate
Baby
Just move the logs a bit
Baby
Come here
Keep this aside and come
What's wrong with you?
I have been noticing
you for the last two days
Nothing
Are you drunk?
Pass me the mayonnaise
Dad...
Sachi and Chadayan are accompanying
few trekkers to the jungle from the other way
By the time they reach the
viewpoint Mini and I should be there
I must to go
You are not going
I have to go, dad
They are my FB friends
If we can convince them,
our project will kick start
Basil...
we are thinking of
relocating from here
Is this the time to make
a business with them?
Is this about Mini?
She already told her Great Grandpa
that there's nothing between us.
Now what's the problem?
She went and told him?
Yes
Is she dumb?
She went and told him and he believed it!
Are you brainless?
You are not going
anywhere, stay with with me
Dad
I must go
Where?
Jungle
Why don't you get it?
How long will you protect me?
Do you think they
are going to kill me?
Where else can we go?
Let them try to kill us
We'll see if we can live
Please let me go now
Go
Hello, Baby Sir
- Are the workers in?
- Yes
We have got one team now
If we get a 50% advance
we can do the rest of it
Here, take this dad
Grandpa
Did you set up any
workers to kill Baby?
Anyway, Baby killed both of them
Shouldn't you tell me
about things like this?
I'll finish Baby
As we are stuck here because of COVID,
my return to Zimbabwe is still in doubt
Around 10 acres plantations
bordering the Devil's Hill...
You give it to me
It's fine, You can
write it in Rimi's name
Now let the police come
Let Baby run up the forest,
I will take care of the rest
Stop, stop
Kuttachan sir
Oh!
Those workers don't have any ID
They were Rohinggya Muslims
There won't be any issues with that
We need not bother about it
We can send a
proposal through email
Yes
You do it in the evening
- Yeah
- Okay
Let me get going
- See you then
- Ok, bye
O.Baby
Which is Othayoth House?
It's this house, sir
Who is this?
My son
Sit down
Were you there when the fight broke
out with your father and Union workers?
No, sir
Where have you hidden your dad?
Where is dad?
Why is all this kept here?
So many swords and knives piled up
Baby would have
entered the forest by now
It won't be that easy
You may need more policemen
Let's see
Let me get going
What happened, Grandpa?
Baby killed two of our workers
But, why did he do such a thing!
Now, media will get involved
It'll ruin our reputation
What happened to him?
We can ask only if we see him
Cheers
Now, it's my game
I am going to rule this jungle
Maoist hunt: Two workers
killed in Thiruvachola plantation
One person escaped to the jungle
See
This looks like a
well thought out plan
I saw Stanley uncle leaving
somewhere in the morning
He didn't take his bike
But, he was carrying his rifle
They're plotting to kill dad in
the forest and label him a Maoist
We have to report this to the police
They're already
involved in this, right?
It's no use reporting
it to the people here
Let's inform the higher authorities
Yes
That's better
How will you go?
If we cross this gate,
landlord will get to know
Will not cross the gate
There is another way
Remove your specs
What happened?
Didn't you sleep at night?
You look very sleepy
It's only 6 here.
Let the sun rise first
- Listen, mom
- Yes
- I got a job here
- Ok
- I need to go there tomorrow
- Ok
It's a good company
Many Malayalis work there too
Can you manage all that?
What?
Can you manage?
Oh! You are here.
Where is Mini?
[Yes. I have enough time]
What happened?
- What?
- Mini and Basil...
- What happened?
- Tell us
[I will call you back]
Left
Left?
Where did they both go?
Did they elope?
Eloped?
Merin can stay
Let Merin stay
Others can leave
Did you know about this?
Tell me. Did she tell
you where they went?
SP might be in office
at least by 10 AM, right?
Let's hope so
Why can't the police authorities
stay back in office at least until 5 PM?
They are on Covid duty
Timings are not proper now
We can actually break the lock
Come. Let's sit inside
Today went in vain
After we register the
complaint tomorrow
How will you go back home?
Where will we go to?
Yes, tell me
My name is Mini
I am love with Basil
My family is against this
So, I'm scared they'll
do something to harm him
Also, his dad is missing
since last evening
I'm suspecting there's
a connection to this
He needs protection sir
Get a paper and write
down whatever you said
Need your parents
name and phone number
Will talk after that
Okay, Sir
Sir is leaving?
Write it and wait
there, Sir will come back
Shall we go and drink juice?
Let's go
Where are you going?
We'll drink juice and come
Which juice?
Orange juice
Sit down... You will get juice here
Close it
- Police are around?
- Yes
Where were you?
Don't make any noise
I am alright
Just keep an eye on Basil
Don't let him go anywhere
I will see him once
and go back to the forest
He is not here
Where is he?
He has gone to the Station
Police station?
Why?
They have labelled you
as a Maoist to kill you
We read it in the newspaper
Dear...
DYSP had called me
I am her grandparent
She gave us this complaint
Oh!
You always ask me
everything in my face
She is very open minded
We brought her up like that
He is 18
She is just turning 17
Sir, please investigate this petition
You should investigate
You should find out where Baby is?
As soon as possible
We gave you this
complaint for our protection
Informing my family was not fair, Sir
Come
Basil is not in love with me
Then why did you
do this to Baby?
Then why did you give them a
complaint saying you are in love?
When I asked you to tear that up...
Why did you ask
them to investigate it?
Who are we to you?
Now, both of you should
always be in my sight
Enough of your roaming around
Did workers or anyone
else get to know this?
No
Shall I take her somewhere else?
Ernakulam maybe?
You want me to run
away with my child?
Fearing him?
I will make that black
boy also run into the forest
What is it?
What happened?
Was he carrying the
gun when he came?
No, he wasn't
Did you hear a sound?
It sounded like a gunshot
Someone would have shot a civet
There are few hunters that side
I heard today is the last
day for police surveillance
Hope no one else heard that.
Anyway we will not report it
I heard a gunshot from afar...
but it's not ours
Where are you going?
I will go check
Vellayan, go look
Your father will come
and search for you
Let him come
Basil...
Basil?
Basil?
Basil?
Basil?
Basil?
Basil?
- If I come out alive, you are dead
- you prick
Basil...
My son...
- Basil...
- Appa...
Basil...
Call me Dad...
Basil...
Basil...
Basil...
God!
My dear son...
Basil...
What happened?
Son...
Baby
What happened to him, Baby?
Talk to me
Basil...
Basil, open your eyes
Mani, what's wrong there?
Baby's son passed away
- Basil?
- Yes
How?
Something happened
to him in the forest
Let me go there
Where are you going?
What's with you, granddad?
Now what. Let her go and see
Basil...
Baby...
Basil...
Baby...
Shall we take him
to the hospital?
No.
No need
I will take care of him
You leave it to me
Grandpa...
Basil didn't die, he is still alive
Great Grandpa, It's all
chill there. I am going back
So, Stanley?
Need a towel?
Sorry
All because you love me
You were right...
You can't tell with whom
and when you'll fall in love
Dad...
Now... I feel the same
way she feels for me
Where are you going, Baby?
I will be back now
Chadaya, come
Jomon, give me the jeep's key
Get in
I am going to get Stanley
When I get back, I should not
see him or his henchmen here
Stanley...
Stanley...
Mom...
Stanley...
He almost killed my son
He killed my Vellayan
And yet I've spared him
Hoping this would
be the end of it
They're just kids, right?
Let them live
Maybe, their feelings
will fade away eventually
Else, will you get them married?
I will
You dog!
- Baby...
- Yes
It's Baby
Kuttachan sir, if you're taking
the gun... I have a better one.
Shoot me
Shoot
Great Grandpa
Baby, it's absurd. Please go
Can someone please
take him to the hospital?
Take him to a hospital, Grandpa
Come here
There's a coin there. Take it
Open it
Look there
Yes
I wrote my will long
back, all in your name
I will burn this!
Baby shouldn't come
here with a proposal
If that requires her
to be dead, so be it!
Jomon needn't know
He won't be able to bear it
What happened, dad?
What do you want?
Grandpa passed away
Come with me
Watch your step
Keep it here
Baby...
Please arrange for
the priests to come
I have informed them
I will get them
Oh Lord, who is mercy for sinners...
We appeal to you to free
us from all our wrong doings
By blessing this holy water
In your mercy, cleanse
us of all our sins
In the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit
Amen...
Great grandpa...
The marriage I had
agreed to in the church...
I don't like it
It's my life...
