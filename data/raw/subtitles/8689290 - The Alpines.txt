Okay.
Okay, it's just 50 minutes.
Worst thing that happens
is you walk in.
Okay, okay.
Just do it, just walk in,
just go in.
One, two, three, go.
If you had to use three words
to describe yourself,
what would they be?
Um...
Disappointment.
Um...
Burden.
Failure.
How often do you remind yourself
of those words?
Every day.
And do you truly believe
that you are
any of these things?
Yes.
You said that college
was the happiest time
of your life.
Yeah.
Would you mind
expanding on that?
What was that like?
In college, you're invincible.
Nothing can break you.
Invincible.
Why is that?
Because I had my friends.
And I had goals, plans.
And that is
a very deadly combination.
Deadly how?
It creates a blanket.
Blanket.
Is writing this much normal?
Yes.
Um...
I'm sorry, I don't remember
what I was...
A blanket?
Do you, uh, do you mind
if we, uh, stop for today?
I'm just feeling kind of tired.
Plus, I got to start packing.
I usually procrastinate
these things
till I'm halfway out the door.
Packing for what?
My old roommate
sent me a letter
inviting us all up
to his lake house this weekend.
Big news.
I didn't even know Roger moved.
Well, enjoy yourself.
I will.
- Zach?
- Yeah?
How are they healing?
Yeah, I decided to go.
I don't know,
I haven't seen them
in, like, five years.
I'm sure it'll be a very
unsurprising weekend with them.
What I mean is,
as soon as I see Gil,
he's inevitably
going to piss me off.
Rowan will pretend
that James and her
have a picture-perfect life,
and she'll try to coerce us
into joining
her weird fitness cult.
Andy and Roger will screw
because they're bored,
and Zach will cry.
Just like old times.
Why am I going, again?
It's three days.
Logan?
Logan! Oh my God, Logan!
Oh, I missed you so much!
- Hey, Rowan.
- All I do is tell James
how much I want
to come visit you.
- You guys should.
- I wish,
but now I've got seven clients
at a time.
Every season is wedding season.
I don't remember
the last time we traveled.
- Well, you look great.
- Pilates and yoga
three times a week,
and I just started
a kickboxing class.
- Wow.
- It wasn't always that easy,
but once I changed my diet,
it's like I have
this entirely different
perspective, you know?
Did you want to join
my company?
'Cause it is the best decision
I have ever made.
I would love that.
Oh, I missed you so much!
Okay, you have to catch me up
on everything,
you job, dates,
recent TV binges.
- Is anyone else here yet?
- Yeah, it's James and me,
uh, and Zach's here, and Andy.
Oh my God!
-Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Holy shit,
I missed you so much!
Oh, look at you, sexy!
Stop, look at your body.
If I had that, I would
literally do everything naked.
Yeah, you'd have to
because my body
would never be caught dead
in that.
What the fuck are you wearing?
- Stop, I know.
- Seriously, is this a cape?
Wait till Gil sees you in that.
He's gonna hate himself.
No, I didn't wear this...
- Mm-hm.
- I didn't.
Our lips are sealed,
don't worry.
No, before I came up,
I had to stop by the office.
My boss is working
on a double homicide case.
- It's so cool.
- I'm bored already.
Come on, I made
some special juice.
We'll go right inside
and enjoy the day.
Andy, it's noon.
Let's go, we're behind schedule.
Come on, you're gonna love it.
I'll get the door,
I got it.
...if you guys wanted to,
but you get all these classes
together.
I was helping this other bride
the other week.
She ended up needing
to have to change...
- James!
- Logan.
Hi!
- Check my teeth.
- You don't floss enough.
That's so lame, no one does.
It's better than my diagnosis.
He told me I have to get
my wisdom teeth pulled out.
If you don't take care
of your teeth,
no boys will want to kiss you.
And here I thought
you only cared about yourself.
How's the new practice going?
It's pretty cool.
I like being my own boss,
and the dental assistants
pretty much do everything.
Can you believe you need to go
to medical school for teeth?
You know, you make fun of me,
but I had to pass
organic chemistry to get in.
- So?
- So I never saw
any party favors.
I'm gonna get you back
for that.
- Is that a promise?
- It's a threat.
Oh, that's even better.
Oh, yes, yes, bring them.
- What? No.
- Yes.
- Shots?
- You're so welcome.
All right, guys,
one, two, three.
Oh, I should've mixed that.
It was the perfect big wedding.
- Yes, it was.
- Hey!
Oh my God!
Hi, Zach!
How are you?
How's your fiancée?
Um, oh, we are drinking already.
What are you having, my friend?
Um, whatever everyone else
is having.
Bad choice. Andy made
some vile concoction.
My special juice.
It's a little early
for that, right?
It's never too early
for my special juice.
Holy shit.
Roger, is that you?
Gil.
You look good.
I mean, I hardly
recognized you.
Thanks, I joined a Curves.
Somehow, you look even better.
Yeah, well, Seattle air.
I had no idea
that air had an impact
on your getup here, sailor.
Yeah, something
you can't afford.
This is gonna be
a long weekend, isn't it?
Yeah, yeah, but I...
I brought drugs and alcohol
to numb.
Of course you did.
All right.
Oh, fuck!
That was... that was good.
Right here, right here.
- Eyes here.
- Hey!
See what happens
if you listen to me?
You see what happens?
- So why defense?
- I don't know.
It seemed like more
of a challenge, I guess.
- Is it?
- Very.
Yeah, my first case,
he was like a serial rapist.
- Yeah, he was a dick.
- I bet.
Did you prove him innocent?
Can't lose your first case.
- God, I could never do that.
- Oh, you monster.
You don't have a choice.
They teach you
to become indifferent.
It's not... whatever.
- Enjoying yourself?
- Yes, I am, thank you.
Great. You want to take
my pills too?
They're in the other pocket
if you want.
Nothing gets past you,
does it?
- You have pills?
- Yeah,
but they're prescription,
it's all good.
- What is it this month?
- Aw, it's endless.
- Could be worse.
- Yeah, could be worse.
Don't look at me like that.
I didn't say anything.
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
- All right, give me this.
- Come and get it.
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hm.
Grow up, Andy.
Mm, no.
Stop.
Logan, take it, take it!
Oh my God. Oh my God,
leave me out of this!
- Leave me out of this!
- Give me my fucking weed!
- No, no, no, no!
- Give it back.
Stop, ah!
Don't pick on a girl. No.
It's not fair.
Ah, well.
Oh, yes.
Happy?
Yeah, actually.
Pretty happy.
Not gonna lie.
Oh my God, you still have this?
Yeah, obviously,
it's awesome.
Does that make me a loser?
- Is that lame?
- I mean, it kind of does.
No fucking way!
That looks like shit.
- What did you do to it?
- You fucking made it!
Walk through the valley
of the shadow of death
in that thing.
Mine looks good.
That was really bad.
It's fine.
Watch this, babe.
Here it is.
I told you not to call me.
Come on, Gil.
Right, I know,
but he is my husband.
We're fine, we're fine.
Yeah, I...
I know.
Yeah, I promise.
Can you just hang tight
for me, please?
All right.
I got to go.
No one saw that.
Boom!
Fuck you! In your mouth!
Gil, it's not as fun
if you're not
a sore loser about it.
Good job, man.
What?
Where the fuck are you going?
Gonna go collect
my consolation prize.
You know, you didn't win, Gil!
This is crazy.
- I'm good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Logan.
Hey.
- What?
- Let's go.
What? Hey.
No!
Put me down!
No, I was talking to Roger.
I don't... stop running.
- You need some Gil time.
- Oh, no, no, no, no!
Don't throw me in the lake!
Now another installment of
America's favorite game show,
Will He Do It?
Stop.
No, stop. Stop.
Boo! Throw her in the lake!
I want to see betrayal!
I remember
when we were that cute.
Were?
Did you get your joint back?
James, stop,
what are you doing?
- I'm being cute.
- James!
I swear to God, put me down.
- I will divorce you!
- Freedom!
Race you down the dock?
- Come on.
- No, I can't.
You want the girl or not, dude?
Come on.
Gil! No!
Gil!
Babe, get in the water!
Zach!
Guys, guys, guys,
he doesn't have to come in
if he doesn't want to.
All right, but at least
let me out
'cause I don't want
to be in here anymore.
Woo!
Zachie boy!
Stop it.
So, I guess I'll start
with the awkward catch-ups
and where are we nows?
I'm currently working
at Bar Louie still
and I'm not serving, though.
I am actually the bartender,
and I get to plan the events
sometimes,
- which is pretty cool.
- Doesn't it suck
still living up there, though?
Um, sometimes, but I still get
to go to the football games
and the bars are dirt cheap.
Why did you spend
thousands of dollars
on a criminology degree again?
Oh, okay,
probably the same reason
you took that bullshit PR job
that you didn't want.
I actually got fired
from that bullshit PR job,
so I really wish
I had it right now.
Seriously? When?
Uh, maybe a month ago.
How did Zoey take it?
Oh, yeah.
I guess I should
tell you guys.
Um, she's gone, she left me.
- Wait, what?
- Yeah,
maybe like three weeks ago.
I can't really remember.
Oh, Zach.
- Damn, dude.
- Yeah, seriously bad timing.
I was just pissed
she kept the ring.
Cost me a fortune.
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,
none of us
really liked her anyway.
That does, that does.
That seriously pisses me off.
I say we track her down,
then kill her.
Normally, I'm not with this,
but I say we just kill her.
How about this? I'll counter.
I'll allow a light keying
of the car I bought her.
- Yay!
- For you, I'll do it.
Do a good job.
But enough about me
and my misfortunes.
Someone else go,
something lighter,
something happier.
Unless you all can top
my misery, I mean...
- Ooh, I can.
- Logan.
Okay, my fiancé left me
five years ago
and now he's sitting
across from me,
so I think
that tops yours easily.
- Wow.
- What?
It always comes back to this,
doesn't it?
- Comes back to what?
- It's been less than four hours
and you're already
starting shit.
- I'm just stating the truth.
- I moved
for a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.
- You refused to come.
- You never invited me.
Yeah, well, it looks like
you're doing pretty well
for yourself.
I saw your posts of Fiji.
And what is that
supposed to mean?
It means that you can afford
something like that.
The trip,
your designer clothing,
that watch you're trying
to show off right now.
James and I are trying
to have...
You really didn't even need me.
- Here we go.
- Well,
when you attend Yale University,
ranked number one
in the United States,
and you are number four
of your graduating class,
you tend to get offered
really well-paying jobs
that give you money
to go on said trips
and to buy said
designer clothing
and my $3,000 watch.
You spent three grand?
Yes, I did, Zach.
So while you're still
a fucking intern
up to his elbows in bedpans
and sutures,
I am standing comfortably
six to eight hours a day
in my Louis Vuittons.
Did I adequately answer
your condescending
question, Gil?
I did?
Okay.
So are you still
mainly cardio...
Are you still a has-been
English lit professor
that sleeps with his TAs?
What?
You do.
Oh, Zach, what?
Five times.
Uh, me and Rowan
are trying to have a baby.
Hey!
- Congrats.
- Thanks, guys.
I can't believe you guys
are starting a family.
Yeah, I'm super stoked
to be a father.
We already got the top names
picked out,
and I'm gonna build
the crib myself.
- Nice.
- We can totally plan
the baby shower, gender reveal,
whatever you guys need.
Slow down.
He said we were trying.
There's no baby.
Not yet.
- I'm gonna head to bed.
- It's, like, 9:00.
- Dude.
- What?
Are you really about to leave
without telling us?
What are you talking about?
Why you brought us here.
The suspense is killing me.
Yeah, Gil.
- What?
- The letter.
The weird letter,
you said you had some big news
and to come up
to your lake house.
- What are you talking about?
- Dude, this is not my house.
- What?
- I received a letter from Logan.
- Logan?
- Wait, what?
Your letter,
it's in my jacket pocket.
Letter? No, no, no.
No, no, I got a letter
and it was from Andy.
No. No, I... that's impossible.
I got mine from Zach.
I got mine from Roger.
Mine is from Logan, so...
Wait, so none of
anyone's letters
- are from James and I?
- Babe, I don't think
that's the big issue here.
No, but admit
it's a little strange.
"Hey, long time, no talk,
stranger.
I miss you."
"I know it's probably
last minute
and asking a lot,
but I'd love it
if you could make it
to my lake house next weekend."
"Oh, yeah, did I tell you
I bought a lake house?
- It's insane."
- "Anyways,
I invited everyone
from the group up.
I have big, big news
for you all."
"But I better not spoil
anything.
It's gonna be
a hell of a weekend."
"Hope to see you there.
Bring lots of booze.
Yours truly..."
- "Roger."
- "Zach."
What is going on?
Okay, it's probably
just the storm.
- James.
- I'm right here.
Check your phones for service,
you guys got anything?
Guys, it's probably
just the storm.
Would you stop saying that?
Oh my God, it's a fucking ghost.
This house is haunted and...
Andy, get yourself together.
Ghosts aren't real.
Then who wrote us
the fucking letter, Gil?
Maybe something with fucking
hands to write it with?
It has to be someone
we knew in school.
James, we literally had
zero other friends.
Yeah, they wanted in the group,
we didn't let them in,
and now they've been
holding a grudge
and pulling off this shit.
James, that could never happen.
- Nobody liked us.
- Or...
Or it's just one of us
playing a prank,
and if they are,
they've got us really good
and they should totally
just come forward right now!
My vote is still on the ghost.
Andy, ghosts aren't real.
Whose fucking house is this?
Everybody, calm down. Relax.
Way too fucking high
for this right now.
All right, ladies, stay here.
Me and Gil are gonna
check things out in the front.
Zach and Roger, you guys see
what's going on in the barn.
- What?
- Let's go.
Let's go.
"Let's go."
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Dude, this place is huge.
Dude, I'm convinced
we only stayed friends with them
- for the girls.
- What do you mean?
I mean,
have you heard them talk?
It makes me want
to kill myself.
That's a given.
Whenever Gil talks,
I want to slit my wrists
with shards of glass.
What do you mean
"for the girls"?
Wow.
Uh, you know,
I mean the girls.
You were always into Logan.
I was into Andy.
They came as a package deal,
I mean.
No, dude, I never liked Logan.
You're such an asshole.
I'm just saying I think
we could've spared ourselves
a lot of unnecessary
memories with them
- if we just dealt with that.
- Yeah,
but then you wouldn't get
to tell all these stories.
Oh, yeah, right,
the ones I love telling.
This is actually pretty nuts,
dude.
We should bring
everybody in here.
- This place is massive.
- It's not small.
Basketball hoop too.
I should get everybody
in here, dude.
Insane.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit.
Dude.
- So we're stranded here?
- At least until morning.
Great, so there could be
a psychopath trying to kill us
and there's nothing
any of us can do about it.
It's a small house, Rowan.
I think we'd notice
the eighth unidentifiable person
lurking in the shadows.
He could be lurking outside.
You don't know.
First of all,
it could be a woman.
Let's not undermine
psychotic women,
because they're fucking nuts.
Secondly, it's cold
and wet outside.
None of us are
interesting enough
to have a personal vendetta
against us.
It's not a psychopath.
All right, let's go back.
Does anyone remember
who got here first?
It was me.
Um.
No, fuck. Uh, maybe Zach?
- I don't know.
- Look, I think we should
just call the police.
There's no service, remember?
All of these
are in different handwritings.
Do you think it means anything?
Does it mean anything, Logan?
I don't know,
I'm not a detective.
You're the next closest thing.
You're always bragging
about Yale,
so why don't you start thinking?
God, Rowan, why are you
such a bitch?
Why are you
such a fucking ditz?
All right, shut the fuck up!
You guys need to come see this.
We need to get out
of this house.
So, should we, like, take bets
on who's gonna get
fucking axed first?
Anyone?
My money, definitely on Gil.
Like, he would make me.
Not if I sacrifice you first.
All right, this isn't
funny anymore, you guys.
Somebody, come clean.
Rowan, we are all
a little bit sick,
but nobody is that demented.
What does this even mean?
What secrets
is it talking about?
I mean, we did
our senior year.
Oh, that's got to be it.
Something tells me
this is a little more major.
You know, some secrets exist
to protect other people...
...to protect yourself.
Andy?
Whoever wrote that is
seriously fucked in the head!
- That's blood.
- So what do we do
because we can't leave here
and we can't call somebody
for help.
And we obviously can't hide
from whatever it is.
Whoever it is.
Right.
So we drink.
- Seriously?
- What?
I mean, this is
supposed to be a vacation.
I haven't seen you guys
in years.
I don't know
when I'm gonna see you again.
We might as well have some fun
until the demons take over
or whatever, right?
Guys, you saw how Andy acted.
How is us not being calm
going to help the situation?
Okay, if we're still
placing bets,
my vote is on Zach.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I just can't sleep.
- Need a distraction?
- That depends.
James, stop.
What are you trying to do?
Trying to make a baby.
What's it look like
I'm trying to do?
Babe, maybe we should take
a break, all right?
Something weird is going on.
These are not our sheets.
No, no breaks.
I want to do this.
For you, for us.
I want this for us too.
I don't want to fail you.
You're not failing me.
I feel like I am.
Babe.
The doctor said
when you're ovulating,
that's when it's gonna work.
I'm on top of this.
I know your cycle by heart.
It's important.
It's important to us.
So we have to try
extra hard this week.
I promise I can do this.
And I want to have a baby
with you
more than anything
in the world.
Okay.
We'll keep trying.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
If I ask to go to the bathroom
really quick,
will that kill the mood?
Yes.
I mean no, you're fine,
just go.
I'm sorry.
- Gil?
- Mm.
It's got to be one of us.
- I just know it's one of...
- Babe...
Well, I was just thinking
about it and...
Yeah, I know you do that a lot.
You all right?
Yeah.
All right, so come back
to bed, please.
- Better?
- Yeah.
Good.
- I mean, there was...
- For God's sake, Logan.
Why is no one else
freaking out about this?
Because, honestly,
it's just a dumb prank.
- A prank?
- Yeah.
Roger is weird like that.
What did you just say?
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no.
Fuck!
Fuck.
It was all right here.
Okay, okay.
Roger this, Roger that.
It's always been
about fucking Roger.
I am just simply asking you
why you're accusing him.
- That's all.
- And I'm simply asking you
why are you defending him?
I'm not.
Yes, you are.
Would you just answer
the question?
Don't drill me like that.
- Like what?
- Like one of your clients.
Oh, see, I'm nice
to my clients.
I like my clients.
- I don't like you.
- Oh, yeah?
You like murderers and rapists
more than me?
Yes.
No.
I don't know.
You're frustrating me.
All right, just wait.
Roger is a dick.
I can just see him pulling
a dumb dick prank like this
and then the surprise
is that he's in rehab
or something.
Just get back to bed, please.
No.
What is wrong with you?
What did I do?
Do you want a list?
Stop being so fucking stubborn.
Then stop being
a total fucking prick.
Are you serious?
What? That always used to work.
God, you are unreal.
You are...
...unreal.
Logan...
- Hey.
- Hey.
Do you mind if I join you?
Yeah, of course.
Listen, I'm sorry about before.
- It's okay.
- No, I freaked out.
Well, yeah, I mean,
something weird is going on.
You had every right to.
Yeah, but that's not me.
I'm Andy, I'm the fun one.
And I'm Zach, I'm the loser.
- The ables are overrated.
- You're not a loser.
You're perfect.
Can I ask you something?
Anything.
Uh, why Roger?
I mean, you could've had
any guy you wanted
back in college and I know
that you still could, so...
I don't know, um...
He's funny, uh,
he always had weed
which, you know
I enjoy so much,
and he was only interested
in the sex,
so clearly my type.
Why do you ask?
I was... I was, uh, curious.
Just be glad you never
messed around in the group.
Complicated things.
Mm, tell me about it.
Wait a minute. Did you ever?
- Oh my gosh.
- No.
- Who?
- No.
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not.
Swear?
I swear.
Want to go to bed?
Um, um, I'm gonna stay
with my beer, actually.
You head on up.
Okay.
- Goodnight, then.
- Goodnight.
Fuck.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.
Yeah, well, you did, so...
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- You look terrible.
- I'm fine.
- Roger...
- Andy, I can't do this
right now, we can't... it's not
gonna happen.
- Dude, what?
- This. Us. Sex.
Okay, it's not... it's not
gonna happen.
What makes you think
that's what I came in here for?
Isn't it, though? That's what
you always come in here for.
It's after midnight.
You're bored,
I'm just... I'm here.
Wow, okay. So that's
what you think about me.
Just get out, okay?
What the hell happened to you?
I grew up, Andy!
Just, please, just get out.
Please.
Just get out.
- Don't talk to me.
- Nothing happened.
Fuck.
- You scared me.
- Yeah, well,
you scared me, so...
- Hey, are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- Let me look at you.
- I'm fine, okay?
Be sane, girl.
Lock your door.
Okay.
Help, help, help me.
Help me, help.
Help.
Help me.
Help me!
Ow, ow.
Ow, help me.
Help me, ow, ow.
Help me, help me, help me.
Help.
Help me.
Help.
Help me, help me.
Help me.
Help me!
Help me! Help me!
Zach, are you okay?
I'm fine.
-I'm fine.
Mm, good morning, sunshine.
Hey, how's it going?
You look like shit.
- Do you want some pancakes?
- Sure.
They're just made.
Drugs, day two.
Day two, doing drugs.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, no, I just, uh,
I didn't sleep much last night.
Do you want me
to make you some coffee?
I'm good, I'm good, but thanks.
- Something happen?
- No, can you just leave me
the fuck alone?
Please?
Thanks.
All right, so me and Gil
are gonna head into town,
see how bad the path is.
Babe, you want to call
the cops?
Sure thing, babe.
- Dude.
- Mm.
Will you put the papers away?
No.
Scheduled to stand in
on surgery when I get back.
I'm supposed to hold a heart.
Like an actual human heart
this time.
- I got to be prepared.
- Okay.
All right.
It's your vacation to ruin.
This isn't much
of a vacation for me.
I hate bugs and trees.
Don't you live in Washington?
Like, aren't there bugs
and trees?
Seattle, city of Washington.
There's no bugs,
just buildings and rain.
Okay.
So then why would you come
to a cabin in the woods
where there are nothing
but bugs and trees
as far as the eye can see?
- For Logan.
- What?
I never should have
just left her, man.
Wait, wait, hold on,
so this means you...
I want her to come back
to Seattle with me.
You think she would?
I'll convince her,
I always do.
Jesus Christ, dude.
Oh, shit.
Hey.
Yeah, no, I'm good.
Last night was just scary.
Yeah, I just...
I just want to be home
with you.
Jesus.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, it's just work stuff.
Oh.
Do they want a live band
or a DJ?
Hey, are you okay?
Do you need to vent?
No and no,
but I know you won't stop
until I do, so...
It's very true.
How's the baby-making going?
Oh, not... we're not...
Not here.
The walls are really thin
and everything is
made of wood, so...
- Right.
- Yeah, you are,
but don't be embarrassed.
You and James are at this point
in your life
and, honestly, if it's going
to make you super happy,
- then why not?
- Yeah, I know!
I know, and I know
that this is what you do
at this point.
- And I am happy.
- Are you?
Oh, shit.
Fuck.
We're not even on
a main road yet.
Hey, can you pop the trunk?
I'm gonna see
if you have a spare.
James?
What are you doing?
I'm calling Rowan.
No, don't do that.
- Why?
- Because...
We have to tell the police.
No, what if it's them,
one of them?
This would just make it worse.
What the fuck
is wrong with you?
- Gil!
- Logan was right.
She's always right.
I need you to calm down.
You're acting ridiculous,
gimme the phone.
Dude, something weird
is going on.
I thought she was overreacting,
but look at the evidence.
The storm, the weird messages,
the fucking invitations,
- and now a flat tire?
- So what?
So what? What?
What do you mean "so what"?
I just don't see how
any of this is connected.
Dude, give me my phone.
Was it all part of
the perfect plan?
Plan? What plan, Gil?
Your plan, your fucking plan.
Don't fucking touch me.
You never told Rowan
about Andy.
What did you just say?
When you fucked Andy
freshman year.
Before I even met Rowan?
How many times?
What does this even matter?
Is she in on this?
Are you guys trying
to get revenge on Andy
and all of us are collateral?
- Is that what this is?
- You think my secrets
are the biggest ones here?
- Yeah, okay.
- Oh my God,
I'm not proud
for leaving Logan.
That was never a secret.
Everyone knows that.
Does Logan know why
Roger is the way he is?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Oh, you don't? Freshman year.
You said you didn't
even like Logan.
You said she was too shy,
too like-minded,
too opinionated.
And, then, I remember you
telling our pledge class
how on your first date
you shoved your dick
in her mouth just to get her
to "stop talking."
I was an idiot.
I said stupid shit
all the time.
Then we met Roger.
She really
and I mean really liked him.
And he liked her, there was
like an instant spark.
Then our first week of finals,
Roger was really stressed
and you bought him
some Adderall, was it,
to help him focus?
Yeah. Kids do it all the time.
Mm-hmm, but then you bought him
a second, third,
fourth, and fifth batch, right?
And then Adderall became Xanax,
and Xanax became oxy,
and oxy became
a little bit of coke,
and then you almost killed him
with fentanyl...
- All right, stop!
- ...'cause you didn't even care!
You didn't care
about his addiction
or how much he would cry
every time the drugs got worse,
because the worse they got,
the easier it was for you
to ruin their lives.
Do you think he knows
that you filled him
with all those drugs
because she would've picked him?
Because Gil Grady doesn't lose.
Hmm?
Should we tell him?
You better watch
your fucking mouth.
I said don't fucking touch me.
What about your wedding night?
When you told Andy
it wasn't too late?
That you two could still
run away together?
And then you fucked her
one last time.
Maybe we should tell
your wife about that.
Stop, stop, stop!
Oh, fuck!
Oh, no...
What the hell is wrong with you?
My God, I need this hand.
What the fuck!
Anyone wanna go skinny dipping?
- No.
- Not really.
All right.
How about a game?
We're already drinking,
so, king's cup?
Truth or dare?
No one's in the mood, Andy.
Well, fuck this tension.
Seriously, I'm sick of it.
I get it, we're stuck here.
Rowan,
truth or dare?
Andy, come on.
No, James, you come on.
This sadness is gonna kill me
before whoever sent
the letter does.
I forgot about the letters.
How?
Rowan,
truth or dare?
Truth.
Excellent.
If not James,
who would it be?
Uh...
I guess I'd have to say
Gil.
And he wouldn't want
a real doctor.
Wow, uh, don't remember
specifying that they had to be
in our inner circle of friends,
but kudos.
Stop! Come on!
I'm joking.
There's no man I would rather
start a family with.
Okay.
Zach,
truth or dare?
Uh, truth.
What is your biggest,
deepest, darkest secret?
Rowan, I don't think
that's very nice.
What?
Secrets... secrets
are no fun, right?
Do you really think
that's the smartest idea?
Whoever wrote that
likes to play games.
So do I.
Zach?
- Um...
- I can answer it for you.
If you know it,
then it's not a secret, dumbass.
Don't call her that.
Go ahead, Zach, tell her.
Tell her.
I'm in therapy.
Um, when I lost my job
and Zoe left me,
I was in a really dark place,
so I now go to therapy
twice a week,
and I have medication
which I refuse to take
because I wanna maintain
some level of normalcy
which, as you all know,
is pretty hard for me.
Um, and because
I don't take them,
I now get horrific nightmares
which Roger can attest to,
and... I think I'm hitting
all the notes here.
Did I miss anything, Rowan?
I was just trying
to have some fun.
I think I was, too,
but if that's not
your definition of fun,
what is?
Um... Roger,
truth or dare?
- Dare.
- Terrific.
How about I dare you
to kiss someone right now?
Make it count.
- Thanks, little buddy.
- No problem.
Your turn to pick somebody.
I don't think anyone
wants to play.
No, keep going.
I'm having so much fun.
Okay! Andy, truth or dare?
Dare.
I dare you to...
shut up for the rest
of the night.
Well, that's impossible
'cause I have to nominate
the next...
No, no, no, see,
Zach can be your voice.
He barely talks,
and you talk so much...
Logan, truth or dare?
- Truth.
- Hmm.
Who is your very best friend
in the whole wide world?
And you can't say Zach Davis.
Okay, so, if I can't pick you...
- Right.
- Then I guess I'd have to pick
Andy.
What?
What?
No, it's just weird.
I didn't expect that.
It's just a game, Rowan.
Careful,
your jealousy is showing.
I would never be jealous of you.
You've been not so subtle
about it all weekend.
What's there to be jealous of?
I have a career, a husband.
What do you have?
All right, stop.
Gil,
truth or date?
Truth.
How did you really break
your hand?
- I fell.
- You're lying.
Stop, stop doing that.
- Doing what?
- Interrogating me.
- I'm fucking sick of it.
- Maybe he did it on purpose.
- Excuse me?
- I just think it's kinda funny
how you and James
are the only two people
who say we can't leave.
You think I did all this?
I do, yeah!
- Really?
- Yes.
Well, you're right, it was me.
I planned all of it.
The letters,
the bloody messages in the barn.
I even broke my hand to make it
more of a fucking challenge.
- I bet you did!
- Boys, enough.
You know, isn't it strange
that you and your wife
are the only ones
who didn't send anyone letters?
What you trying to say?
You know exactly
what I'm trying to say.
And Logan's the only person here
to have invited two people.
Is she in conspiracy
with my wife and I?
- Leave Logan out of this.
- Yeah, 'cause it could never be
either one of your faults
'cause you're just so perfect.
- I'm gonna tell her.
- Tell her.
Tell everyone.
Tell Roger.
- What?
- Guys, knock it off.
Aw, is Zachie sad?
- Is Zachie upset...
- Gil, stop!
- Oh, shut up, slut.
- Fuck you!
- Whoa!
- What's wrong, Zachie?
Are you gonna cry?
I just don't think
that we should be turning
on each other, Gil.
Yeah, well,
it's a little too late
for that now, isn't it?
Tomorrow when they clear
the roads, we get outta here.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Zach?
- Oh.
- Sorry.
No reception in the basement?
- Uh, no, just music.
- Oh.
Um, can I sleep in here tonight?
Uh... sure.
Uh, are you okay?
No.
Hop in.
Ready to lose?
Just like college.
Hey.
Did your first option
turn you down?
You're mad then, I'm guessing?
Why would you ask that?
For... me kissing Andy
at the fire.
No, you and Andy
were always a thing.
No...
we were not always a thing.
Moved out 'cause, I don't know,
there's no one else
to go home to, I guess.
It's not a thing,
it's... it's sad.
Roger, you don't have to explain
yourself, it was just a game.
Were you expecting me
to kiss you during this game?
I'm kidding.
Okay.
Do you wanna smoke a little bit?
I wish we could.
All my drugs keep disappearing,
so I have nothing to offer.
Drugs as in... plural.
You know what I mean, like...
I'm... I'm fine.
I thought you got better, Roger.
I'm... I'm better from what
I used to be, for sure.
Really?
Um...
I've been like that all day.
All right, come on,
smoke with me.
- It'll get rid of the shaking.
- I don't have anything.
I told you that.
Oh, I know, I know.
- Logan...
- But what if I do?
You don't. That's...
She tiny but she mighty.
Wow, wow, nice.
Okay, great.
You know this is illegal?
- Is it?
- Yeah.
I'm 127 percent sure
this is illegal.
Oh my God, then it's so good
that I know a great lawyer.
- Where... of course you do.
- It's me.
Where has this been
the whole time?
- Holding out on me.
- I am, 'cause you upset me.
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.
Do you remember that night
freshman year when I ate
really bad sushi
and I was throwing up all night?
But you laid in bed with me
for like five hours
just running your hands
through my hair
and singing really badly
to make me feel better.
- It wasn't that bad.
- It was pretty bad.
Thoughtful and tone-deaf
does sound like me.
I think about that night a lot.
I think about you all the time.
- Ow.
- What... what happened?
- Nothing.
- You winced. What's wrong?
No, I'm fine,
don't worry about it.
Andy, Andy, stop, stop.
- What did you do?
- I'm fine.
- When did you do that?
- I'm fine!
- Is that why you're in therapy?
- Andy, no, I'm fine.
- Then show me.
- What?
I want to see how fine you are.
Is the other one like that?
Yeah.
But why didn't you call me?
Any of us.
I didn't think anyone
would care.
Oh my God.
Is this your secret?
My secret?
That message...
Stupid message.
Oh.
Um...
No, I don't think
this would be mine, Andy.
How?
I have older secrets.
Zach, you're...
you're starting to scare me.
What's going on?
Um...
Andy, uh...
Wait. What... what are you doing?
Andy, I'm so in love
with you, okay?
I have been in love with you
since the first moment
I ever saw you,
that night that you came
into my and Roger's room
freshman year
in your underwear, drunk,
looking for Logan.
I remember thinking
you are the most beautiful girl
that I have ever seen, and I
never stopped thinking that.
I've thought that every single
second for the last eight years
and I've just been too much
of a... pussy to tell you
because every day I wonder
what would've happened
if I'd told you sooner
because it's always been me.
It's not Roger, it's me.
And I think that
if I had told you sooner,
I wouldn't have ever done
any of this.
Zach...
do you really think
I'm that stupid?
- What?
- Last night, I...
You rejected me.
- No, I wanted to come.
- And now that I know,
all of a sudden
you're in love with me?
Yeah... no,
I didn't have sex with you
because I'm in love with you,
that's my point.
You think because I'm me,
you can make up
this bullshit love confession
to deflect from the fact that
you're trying to kill yourself?
- That is not what I'm doing!
- "Oh, Andy's easy.
I'll just fuck her
until she shuts up.
She'll totally forget..."
I wasn't even gonna tell you
about it!
You were in love with me
when you were engaged?
I tried not to be.
Okay, well, then,
what was this, Andy?
You came in,
you're talking about that night,
you were cuddling me,
you tried to kiss me.
You're gonna say
that you never had
any kind of feelings
for me whatsoever?
- I'm not in love with you, Zach.
- Andy, come on.
I'm sorry, Andy.
- I can't be near you right now.
- Please don't.
- I don't remember that.
- You totally should!
Oh, man.
I had to sit
on your tiny twin bed,
which is the smallest thing
in the world
with all the pillows
and stuffed animals and shit.
I know, I was there.
I listened to you cry
about how he never...
called or texted
after you lost it to him.
- Do you have a point?
- Yeah, I...
I kissed you, and then...
And like, the next day,
you guys were together.
Yeah, but I slept with you
like a year later.
Just to get back at Gil, like,
it wasn't anything serious.
- No!
- It's exactly what happened,
'cause that night,
he went to his frat party
instead of your soccer game,
and you came back to my room
crying, and we...
and, uh...
We never talked about it
after that ever again.
How do you remember
all of that?
It's just stupid, I...
I remember everything about you.
It's dumb, I know, it's stupid.
No, it's not.
Yeah, it is, but it's true, so.
Okay, I have to tell you
something.
- What?
- I had the biggest crush on you.
- Yeah, okay.
- I did, after that night!
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know.
- I was scared, I think.
- Of what?
- 'Cause I wasn't him?
- No, that's not...
No matter how many times
he hurt you and...
...how many times you said
he made you feel like
just completely worthless,
like shit,
you always chose him, and...
I get it, I guess.
I wasn't cool.
I wasn't popular,
I wasn't strong, I couldn't...
I couldn't get us into parties,
couldn't protect you,
I just wasn't him.
- I never wanted you to be him.
- I tried, I always tried.
- I'm still trying.
- Roger, hey, stop!
I... I followed you around
like a puppy dog, you know.
I slept with your best friend
hoping you'd notice me.
I was a... I was a drug addict.
I...
I am.
I know.
I wouldn't have chosen me
either, honestly.
- I wish I had chose you.
- No, you don't.
- I do, no, I suck.
- No, I suck!
I should've told you how I felt.
I should've...
I should've kissed you
when I wanted to,
I should've said something
sooner,
spoke my mind, I don't know.
- I should've done a lot.
- When did you want to kiss me?
When I met you,
at that party.
The first time
we went ice skating.
The football game you won with
like four pointless overtimes.
Now.
I want to kiss you now.
Sorry if that was... forward.
No, no, no.
Do you want to talk about it?
No.
Because you did do it.
Oh my God.
- That is just great, James!
- I had to.
I don't even know
what that means.
He was talking like a lunatic!
He kept going on about the plan
and saying that Logan
was always right,
whatever the fuck that means...
I had to!
I'm not a monster.
Look, I believe you, okay?
I'm sorry.
I don't know if I trust them.
James, they're our best friends.
Are they?
When was the last time
we saw them?
- Our wedding.
- Two years ago.
Two fucking years ago.
Do we even know if
they're the same people anymore?
You got me.
You can trust me.
I know. I know.
You're my best friend for life.
What, what are you doing?
I'm distracting you.
Rowan, come on.
Hey.
Please.
Wait.
Give me a minute.
Yeah.
Fuck.
Oh, shit.
Shit!
Multiple scenes like this are
playing out throughout the area.
Look, this tree has just smashed
not just through the roof but
through the side of the house,
through the windows.
A lot of the interior
of the house is exposed.
Trees have fallen
on power lines,
on roadways,
blocking roadways,
and police are urging people
to stay off the roads
if at all possible,
just trying to convey
how dangerous it is out here.
Portions of the northeast
underwater
after severe storms
pounded the region.
Some streets look
more like waterways,
water so high, roadblocks
floating down the streets...
Babe, what's going on?
What is this, James?
Where... where did...
- James!
- Where did you get that?
Answer the question now.
Babe, babe,
it was a long time ago.
And you never thought
to tell me?
Well, I didn't technically
know you when it...
when it happened.
How many times did "it" happen?
I don't know, I don't know.
- How many times?
- I don't know, like three.
Three?
Oh my God.
- Three?
- Babe.
- I hate you!
- Stop, stop!
I hate her!
You know that I hate her!
- That's why I couldn't tell you.
- I hate you!
Stop, stop!
Stop!
I'm having an affair.
What?
What are you... I don't...
I don't... with who?
Riley.
Your... your female
yoga instructor Riley?
Yeah.
For how long?
- It's not...
- I said...
for how fucking long?
Over a year.
A year?
- I do love you.
- Apparently not enough.
- No, I wanted to end it.
- I don't believe you.
I was, as soon
as we got back home.
Has she been to our house?
Has she slept in my bed?
Answer me.
I said answer me!
No, she's never been
to the house.
I swear to God, Rowan,
if you're lying.
I'm not lying.
She's never been to the house.
- I want a divorce.
- I think I'm pregnant.
You're not pregnant,
you're lying.
- I'm not lying.
- You're not pregnant!
- You can't leave me!
- Stop talking!
Stop talking.
I can't believe this.
I can't believe you slept with
Andy and you didn't tell me.
You can't believe me?
You're gay,
and you can't believe me!
I am not gay!
You've been having an affair
for over a year.
- You gotta sorta like it.
- I don't!
- Don't what? You don't what?
- Stop, stop yelling at me!
- Don't you fucking touch me!
- Don't you fucking touch me!
- Hey, are you...
- What the...
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
Oh my God, get out,
Gil, get out!
Obviously I didn't respond
to your text fast enough.
What are you talking about,
what text?
The text you just
fucking sent me.
- I don't even have my phone.
- What?
I haven't had my phone for
hours, I can't find it anywhere.
Why do you have the letters?
I was looking for answers.
Yeah, and I just got mine.
Stop being so dramatic, dude,
just get outta here.
Logan.
No.
Bye-bye.
He's such an idiot.
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.
Oh my God, Gil, get off him!
Gil, stop!
Stop, you're gonna kill him!
Oh my God!
Fucking psycho!
- Fuck!
- Oh my God.
Stop running like a little bitch
so I can beat the shit
out of you.
With one hand?
Come on, let's go.
Both of you, knock it off.
Tell her. Tell her,
the only reason you asked her
on a second date is because
I told you I liked her.
- That's not true.
- Yeah, bullshit.
Could somebody please come up
here and help me please!
You couldn't just let us
be happy?
You just had to get the girl
to prove a point?
All she ever was to you
was a fucking point!
- I loved her.
- You left her though
for a goddamn internship?
- Fuck you!
- Logan, what's going on?
Stop it, you both
are acting like children.
- You wanna see childish?
- No.
You took my fucking pills?
Aw, does the junkie
need his fix?
- What is happening?
- Give them back to me!
So pathetic!
Look at you.
She'll never want you, get it?
So stop trying.
Never, never, huh?
Bloody message on the walls
told you that?
- Roger...
- No, no, no.
Secrets, secrets,
are no fun, right, guys?
- Stop.
- I fucked her sophomore year!
Yeah, when you two
were together.
Ask her.
Go ahead, tell him.
- Tell him, Logan!
- Roger!
You cheated on me?
It was complicated.
How?
What about Andy?
Don't you think
something like this
could hurt your best friend?
Please, she never liked Roger,
not even when...
When what?
No, no, when what?
You stopped yourself.
I can't believe
I came here for you.
I wanted to start over.
I wanted you
to come back to Seattle with me.
- To start over?
- Yeah, start over.
Leaving you was
the worst decision of my life.
Only took you a whopping five
years to figure that out, huh?
So convenient. Congratulations.
Gil, stop! Gil!
Whoa, Gil, stop!
Stop!
Stop it! Gil!
Stop it!
Stop!
James.
Have you been down here
the whole time?
What are you doing
with that knife?
- You.
- Andy.
It was you this whole time.
You brought us here.
Andy, why are you covered
in blood?
Because you want to destroy
our fucking lives.
Why, why would you do this?
Whose blood is that?
Why don't you tell me?
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
Seriously?
You're gonna play innocent
after all the little
fucked-up things you did to us?
I swear I didn't do any of this!
- Why would I do any of this?
- Because you know!
- You know my secret.
- Your secret, what?
- Her baby.
- What?
Don't fucking do that!
Call it what it is, an abortion.
- You were pregnant?
- Okay, hold on.
No, you know how much
this hurt me.
No, no, I know
what this looks like.
- No, wait!
- Tell them it's all you.
- Tell us, Logan.
- It's not! I didn't...
- Why are you lying?
- It's not me!
You're the only one who knew.
No.
I wasn't the only one who knew.
- You what?
- What are you talking about?
I told Zach.
After your appointment,
I didn't want you to be alone
when I went to class,
so I told him.
- No.
- He knew, he's always known.
No.
Zach, what is going on?
I knew if anyone was gonna
figure it out, it'd be you.
Wow, well done.
Wow!
Three days, that's good.
- Is this a prank?
- No, it wasn't a prank.
Not some serial killer,
it wasn't ghosts,
but that was a very good guess.
This is what I would call
an intervention.
- You did all this?
- I did all...
No... yes and no.
I influenced a lot,
do not get me wrong,
but the rest was entirely
of your own doing.
A few texts sent here and there,
a vague and threatening message,
an anonymous letter,
taking you all here.
A little bit of fake blood
for you, my love,
and then I watched
the rest unfold.
I sat back and watched
all of you fucking snap!
You all went insane.
You, little by little,
one by one,
pawns in my chess game, broke!
James, you fucking broke
Gil's hand!
That's goddamn awesome!
- James.
- James, please calm down.
Do not calm down.
James, do not calm down,
because this next part, I have
a special guest appearance.
It's your wife, and she's
gonna love this next part.
- Rowan!
- My wife is dead!
What did you say?
My wife is dead.
My God, Zach.
- No.
- Zach!
No, I...
no one was supposed to die!
- Oh my God.
- She was not supposed to die.
- You killed my wife.
- I killed her?
I didn't touch her.
I did.
I did!
James, what are you
talking about, man?
I shoved her
and killed my wife.
Fuck.
James...
I'm sorry.
That's...
You're so pathetic.
Look at you!
The fuck are you laughing?
- I'm sorry.
- This is your fault.
No, it's not.
I never laid my hands on her.
- That was all you.
- Shut up.
Hey, I didn't lay
my hands on her.
- That was you, you hit her.
- Shut up, shut up!
Was it off an impulse,
or did you do it slow?
Shut up, I'll kill you
right now, I swear to God.
I swear to God,
I'll fucking kill you, Zach.
I swear to God.
Okay.
Easy, tiger.
I got you, it's okay.
Do it.
Okay?
Do it.
- Hey, hey, it's okay.
- James, grab that gun.
- Don't. Gil, stop.
- Take it. Take it.
- Grab the gun from him, James.
- No.
- James, stop!
- There you go, there you go.
- Shoot him, shoot him.
- No, no, no, no!
James, please do it,
you said you wanted to do it,
I'm giving you the opportunity,
please do it.
Don't kill him,
please don't kill him, please.
- What are you doing, man?
- He wants this,
he's trying to get
inside your head.
I'm already inside
your head, James!
- Shut up.
- That's why you broke
your best friend's hand, that's
why you murdered your wife.
I have complete control
over you.
- Just fucking do it.
- Shut up, shut up!
Shut the fuck up, Zach,
I'll fucking kill you right now!
- I'm asking you to!
- Make it stop.
How long was she cheating
on you, James?
How long was she pretending
that she loved you?
Oh, she did tell him.
Guys.
He's taunting you, man,
shoot him!
Is that what made you kill her?
Shut up the fuck up, Zach.
Stop it.
James, he is taunting you,
shoot him!
I am taunting you,
and you should shoot me,
but listen, before you do,
did she confess anything else?
This is friend to friend,
I'm just asking.
Did she tell you what else
she was hiding from you?
- Stop it, Zach, please.
- James, listen to me.
- Listen to me.
- There was nothing else.
We surveyed
our audience here, okay?
- Shut up, Zach.
- And before tonight's broadcast,
survey says...
...she didn't want
to have your baby.
She never did.
Now, granted,
had things worked out
with you and Andy
back in college, maybe...
- Shut up!
- You're just letting him talk.
Shoot him!
Do it, do it.
Come on, please.
Fucking do it.
James, do it.
Please.
Motherfucker, fucking do it!
Pull the trigger!
- James.
- I'm not a murderer.
James.
- Neither was I.
- Zach...
Zach, no!
James!
James, stay with me!
Hey, hey, look at me!
James, James, look at me!
- James!
- You fucked it up!
You fucking idiot,
you fucked...
you fucked...
you fucked it up!
- Why?!
- Hey, hey, look at me.
Hey!
- James!
- You fuck...
You know, if you were
a real doctor,
you could probably save him,
it's a shame.
You fucking psychopath!
He wasn't supposed to die!
I didn't want anyone to die!
He was...
He fucking ruined everything.
He fucking...
he fucking ruined everything.
Zach, listen to me,
what is the point of this, Zach?
Two people are now dead.
Because no one
ever listens to me!
Because I'm Zach!
I'm kind, gentle, pushover Zach!
I'm everyone's shoulder
to cry on!
I'm everyone's secret-keeper!
I'm everyone's
fucking punching bag!
We trusted you, man,
we told you our secrets.
You should feel honored,
not fucking crazy.
Honored? Honored to know
that you slept consistently
with the only girl
I've ever been in love with,
but you were supposed
to be my best friend?
- I stopped once you told me.
- You knew!
There's no way you didn't know.
Zach, please don't do this,
okay?
Why? Because you love him?
Who cares?
No one ever cared how I felt!
Okay, that's enough.
All of us knew
that you liked Andy.
- I mean, don't you think...
- Don't interrupt me!
It is my turn to fucking talk.
Why, why are you doing this?
Oh, why don't you
tell them, babe?
I think you know exactly
why I'm doing this.
- I didn't mean to.
- Stop crying!
Just tell them.
His wrists, look at his wrists.
You all abandoned me.
All of you.
I'm sorry.
- Your turn, Roger.
- What?
Come on, don't be bashful.
I'm not the only one
who's tried.
- How did you know that?
- You tried to kill yourself?
Twice.
Yeah, I, uh...
I overdosed twice.
Um, once on accident,
and the other on purpose,
last year.
- How did you know?
- You can try and transform
yourself into Gil all you want,
but I think deep down,
you're always gonna be
a sad, pathetic little junkie.
- Shut the fuck up!
- Zach, give me the gun!
Stop, stop, just stop trying
to save him.
You can't save guys like us.
Okay, okay, I get it.
Okay, lesson learned.
Don't talk to me
like I'm a child.
- I'm not a fucking kid.
- I'm not talking to you
like you're a child, Zach,
please, just listen!
James and Rowan,
their marriage was toxic, okay?
You said there was an affair,
right, there was an affair,
so I can... I can make it
all go away, okay?
It's easy, it's easy, okay?
I can help you, Zach,
just let me...
I don't want your help!
I don't need
your help now, Logan!
I did!
I would've loved it before!
But no!
I called all of you
the day that...
None of you answered,
and I called all of you
three times,
and no one even called me back.
It's too late!
You guys are just too late.
- You're just too late.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Okay, you wanna shoot somebody,
man, shoot... shoot me.
Okay, it's my fucking fault.
I slept with Andy, I'm the one
who didn't tell Logan
how I felt.
I'm the only reason
we've been friends with Gil,
and with fucking James,
so just... just shoot me, man.
Just, please.
All I ever wanted was
for you guys to listen.
Andy, I loved you,
and you could've changed this
for everyone.
Please, Zach.
Now you all have
one more secret to keep.
Please.
The seven of us have always been
a really deadly combination.
Oh my God.
- Oh my God, Zach, no.
- Andy, stop.
Andy, do not touch him.
- What?
- I said, do not touch him.
Back away.
Oh my God, oh my God.
Andy, I'm not gonna
tell you again.
Back up!
Get away from him.
Okay.
Okay, this is what
we're gonna do.
Andy, I need you to get up.
Andy, I need you to get up.
Get up, Andy. Get up!
I need you to go upstairs,
I need you to shower,
I need you to put those clothes
in a garbage bag, okay?
Gil, I have to wrap your arm,
we gotta stop the bleeding.
We gotta strip all the sheets,
we gotta start washing them.
Roger, you gotta collect
all the garbage, okay?
Any paper, any bottles,
anything lying around
that could trace us back here,
and I'm gonna start wiping down
all of the furniture
to get rid
of the fingerprints, okay?
I have gloves in my car.
Every single one of you
are wearing them!
Zach just killed himself,
Rowan and James are dead,
they're fucking dead!
You're right, they're dead,
so we have to protect ourselves.
No, we...
- We need to call the police.
- No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Listen to me,
we cannot call the police, okay?
Because if we call them
and we tell them
exactly how everything happened,
they're going to bring us in
for questioning
and we're gonna remain guilty
until proven innocent,
and they will still pin it
on one of us,
and I'm not going to jail.
Okay?
Is anyone else still opposed?
All righty then.
Let's start cleaning.
No.
Fuck! Fuck!
Oh God.
You can still tie it up.
You see, humans are
extremely simple creatures...
...each individually formulated
by a mixture
of both light and dark,
good and evil.
Most are balanced of the two,
and the others... not.
But then there are the immoral,
the message, the warnings
to the rectifiable,
although forgiven by God
are damned to a life
of predetermined torment
by their sin,
consumed by a life
of only wrong decisions.
The glutton, no temperance.
The greedy, no charity.
The wrath, no patience.
The envious, no kindness.
The lustful, no self-control.
The sloth, no zeal.
And the proud,
no humility.
No happiness.
No virtues.
No end.
The story will never end.
- Zach?
- Yeah.
How are they healing?
