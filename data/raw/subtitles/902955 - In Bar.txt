- There you go. No more waiting in line.
- How about getting in?
It's free. The number's here.
- That gets you free entry for a year.
- What if it wears away or I lose
- You're late, Pele.
- Tonight, yeah.
- OK. OK.
- See you then.
- How are you doing?
- Good.
- How's things?
- How are you doing?
When did you guys meet?
We... We ran into
each other at the door.
- Come on, hurry.
- How's things?
- There's no time left. Come on.
- But I only just got here.
Let me sit for a
couple of minutes.
No! The stands are going wild for you.
Can't you hear?
Barbo! Fill those glasses!
We'll be right back.
- Did you sort something out?
- The doctor's all set.
- I got an appointment for tomorrow.
- You did? You're fantastic, Nail!
Hey, get moving. You show them!
Watch out for this guy!
Here comes the
king of the universe!
- Good luck. Take care of yourself.
- I will.
- Nail, you're late.
- Tonight, yeah.
Football is neverjust football.
- You played so well.
- Thanks.
You're a cure for my thirst
and king of the field, Nail!
Everything about your game
gets better every day, Nail.
That's what progress is.
You have yesterday, then today.
You think over what you've done.
And when it's your turn to play again...
You're a whole different guy.
You see? TOA is there with you
every moment of your life.
- Well thanks, Abi.
- Hey, the guy played football.
He wasn't in the
debating Olympics!
The more effortlessly you do something
the easier it looks.
The point is to be able to
see the subtlety involved.
Don't get him started on TOA again!
You say don't get him started,
but I've never heard him say a word.
So just take it from us.
- Absolutely.
- Hey, where are the beers?
I did all that running for you
and you just get drinks for yourselves.
The bar's about to close
and there's still people turning up.
You're going to get lucky
with these guys just coming in.
- I can't handle a new relationship.
- Why not?
I'm still thinking over the last one.
I forget the teapot's on the
I sense my mind is elsewhere...
I leave the tea brewing...
Wait, are you saying
you check out everyone who walks in...
- And figure out which of you'll land who?
- No, of course not.
Are you kidding, Nil? No way!
Would these guys do a thing like that?
Exactly. You got it, Nil. This jerk told
me straight out that he'd landed
- I was honest.
- God! No!
God knows what would happen
if you didn't do the thinking-over thing.
I do and what happens?
Just look at me!
So hang on. Did the same thing happen
when I first turned up?
- You see? That's TOA for you.
- Sure, but we look at it differently.
I feel it. Look, she's coming my way.
Is she trouble or a gift from God?
I can't tell. But she's coming my
Here goes then...
There they are.
- Hey, where have you been?
- Looking at wedding dresses. I'm wrecked.
My cousin, Nil.
She's here from Edirne for the wedding.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Meaning she's here in summer.
- So are you angry now?
- But it's bullshit, that thing you do.
Not at all.
I sensed something would happen.
I realised the moment I set eyes on you.
That's her, I thought. She's here.
Would anyone ever understand
what happened to me when I saw you?
Well, I figured you'd be the only one.
So I clung on to you.
Aren't you getting more beers?
- Hey, go on Nail.
- Get out and play, score a goal, Nail.
- Bring the beers Nail!
- Listen to that!
- Barbo, pull us four pints.
- Sure.
I talked to the guy. Everything's
fixed. How are you?
- How do you think? Terrible.
- It'll be over, Pelin. Everything is.
Nothing's ever over.
If only tomorrow would just be done.
I've had enough.
And what's keeping
Cenk? I don't get it.
He's a mess too. He's really rattled.
He's been wandering about like a
I was with him during the day.
We went to the doctor together.
I'll go see if she's OK.
Pele, your beers are all set.
Excuse us...
- Is something up with Pelin?
- She's a little sick. She's a bit down.
Cenk's not around either.
Could you guys
be hiding something from me?
Why would we hide anything?
Where did you get that idea?
- Cenk, where the hell are you?
- I just got here. Just walked in.
Here he is.
Hi. How's things,
Nil? How are you?
- Good thanks, Cenk. You?
- OK. Not bad.
- Where's Pelin?
- Out the back.
- Is she OK?
- What do you think?
- She's been waiting hours for you.
- I wasn't out there partying.
- I got a car set up.
- That's good. OK.
She won't have to
drag around in taxis.
Anyway, I'll see if she's OK.
- Right. See you then.
- See you.
So what's wrong with Pelin?
You're definitely hiding something.
The paranoia's setting in.
You asked for it, Nil.
Over to you.
Look, don't any of you get the feeling
the guy's telling the truth?
All this stuff, what Nil just said...
Isn't that the start of something?
OK, Abi. Run us through then.
Look, what's going on? Who's
paranoid? What's up with Pelin?
It's a hunch, not paranoia.
You know, the hunch you just had.
- You just asked about Pelin, right?
- Yes.
Well, we call that TOA.
She's a bit better.
Cenk turned up too.
- Meaning?
- TOA. Think over again.
- Meaning?
- TOA isn't paranoia.
With TOA, nothing's valid if
it doesn't have a rational explanation.
The rule is that the more answers
an opinion offers, the more valid it
You see, experiences unfold
as they're perceived...
And the reality comes out much later.
Look, all the lies in the world
are now coming out one by one, right?
- Thanks to the TOA guys.
- Exactly, thanks to the TOA guys.
- We're off, guys.
- OK.
- OK?
- See you then.
I'm really sorry.
I'm just not up to sticking around.
No problem. It's closing time in a bit.
So we'll be out of here too.
When the gentleman's done
with his philosophising...
- See you then. Take care.
- See you.
I'm not asking anything.
Go on, I'm listening.
TOA has zero interest in the future...
Because there's no way of knowing
what will happen in the future.
The crucial thing is the past.
Because it's already happened.
Experiences unfold
as they're perceived.
And the reality is always hidden
deep, deep down.
Do you mind waiting outside?
It's getting too crowded in here.
OK.
I'll go and join the others then.
See you when you're done.
- OK?
- OK. Don't worry.
The woman kicked me out.
She said it was too crowded in there.
They're better off anyway
just girls together.
I don't get it.
You had this coming.
Why don't you take precautions?
You never heard of condoms?
You pick now of all
times to say that?
The girl's sitting up there
shit scared for God's sake...
I'm confused anyhow.
I just can't get my head round it.
I think, right it's like that. And
it turns out like it says in the book.
Everything has its place.
There's an explanation for everything.
The questions are obvious,
likewise the answers.
Everything I figure out
by myself is there.
If you can figure it out by yourself
then you don't need those books.
They're for people who can't.
Plus what does wearing a condom
have to do with religious books?
OK, let's say 100 million years ago
in the virgin forests of Africa...
A tree grows old
and topples over.
Would you say that tree
fell down or not?
- Well, you said it. It fell down.
- What if no one saw it or heard it?
- No one at all?
- Right.
Don't come unstuck.
The tree fell down. It fell down.
Don't be like this, Pelin. Look, you and I
were with Sevgi that time.
OK. I'll be fine in a minute.
Come on, let's go.
Hey, what are you doing?
You've devoured that ciggie.
- I'm thinking.
- He's thinking things over again.
Exactly... Exactly...
Abla!
This is an operating theatre!
You can't come in. Everything's fine.
- But those screams! What's going on?
- It's OK. I'll let you know. Come
- Let me know what? Out of the way!
- I'll let you know how she is.
Girls, the doctor's very tired today.
Call me tomorrow for an
- OK. Let's go.
- This is just ridiculous.
- It's ridiculous.
- Hey, what's up? Where are you going?
What's going on?
What are you doing here?
Come on. We can
talk at home.
- G ven, you drive.
- What's going on?
Your parents know you're here, right?
We don't want it being a problem.
No, I told them anyway.
Guys, I didn't sleep at all last night.
You won't be mad at me, will you?
No problem. Do
as you like.
Wait. Let me get rid of that.
- G ven, we're staying over tonight too.
- But there's that gig this
Sure. But we can all come
back together when it's over.
OK.
I'll take care of everything.
Don't you worry about it, OK?
I'm scared.
Suppose we gave up on the abortion?
Suppose we didn't go through with it?
Don't be funny, Cenk.
Why? Aren't we doing it
because we don't have any choice?
If we gave ourselves a choice,
then we wouldn't have to do it.
It's all the same for you
of course, whichever way.
What am I supposed to tell everyone?
My parents?
Tell them we're getting married.
What's wrong?
Wouldn't you marry me?
I don't know.
If you asked, I'd think about it.
Well, listen to that!
OK.
Will you... Marry me?
Of course I'll marry you.
Look, the boat's something like that.
- Hi there.
- Hi. How are you doing?
- Good. You?
- So you cracked open the beers already!
Well, I guess we made a start.
How are you, guys?
There should be some beers in the fridge.
Help yourself. Nail, get us a
Give me a break!
You have no shame, do you?
Let me go right now and find my Dad.
I'll talk to him, see what he says.
How about we have a double wedding?
Would we make it in time for Sevgi's?
Not a chance.
OK, so we'll have the honeymoon
before the wedding.
I'm off then. You leave with the others.
Don't stick around on your own.
See you tonight.
I'm off. Hi, Nil. See you tonight, guys.
Enjoy the gig, OK? I can't make
- OK, bye then.
- What's up with him?
What do you think? TOA.
That's for sure.
- I'll explain later.
- OK.
- Look, here's where you eat.
- Let's get out of here.
- Why? Nil's here now. It's all cosy.
- That's what I mean. Nil's here
You're unbelievable! You little flirt!
Come on. Let's go then.
Guys, we're off.
I have to pick up those brochures.
We can check them out in the bar.
I take my bag.
- What's up, guys?
- I'm out of socks.
We'll get some down at the market.
- He's really losing it.
- Nil, don't be late...
Get there before Sevgi and co, OK?
- Hey, come on!
- I've had it with you!
- How are you doing?
- Good.
What's that smile for?
Nice things always make me smile.
What are those nice things then?
Don't you think it's nice being alone
just the two of us after all this
It's very nice.
You're very nice...
You're beautiful.
I'm actually, well, a bit scared.
Does it hurt?
I'm scared too.
I mean, of hurting you.
So you know you're...
Actually, I'm also...
What's the matter?
- You know you keep asking about Pelin?
- Yes.
She went to the doctor today.
She's pregnant.
They were going to go for an abortion.
We didn't tell you.
Well, she said not to tell you.
OK. She's right, of course.
Well, I suddenly thought of that.
Then Cenk.
I haven't done
that before.
And when you said, you know...
I really love you.
I love you too.
I love you so much.
- Poor girl. Imagine the state she's in.
- No, no. I think they dropped the
Although I don't know for sure.
I'll find out from Cenk tonight.
I understand.
Well, I guess kissing's OK.
- Course it is.
- OK then.
- I'm just going to... I'll be right back.
- OK.
JUSTICE IS THE CORNERSTONE
OF THE NATION STATE
They said life was beautiful,
guys who know right from wrong...
They said there was still hope
if you loved other people...
They said life was short
if you didn't have happiness...
They said you'd never get away with
the things you did in this world...
They said good people were winners
and evil was a disaster...
They said that to be happy
you just had to make people happy...
They said good people were winners
and evil was a disaster...
They said that to be happy
you just had to make people happy...
I thought things over again...
They weren't lying...
I thought things over again...
They weren't lying...
They said good people were winners
and evil was a disaster...
They said that to be happy
you just had to make people happy...
They said good people were winners
and evil was a disaster...
- Come on, out with it.
- We can talk later. Forget it for now.
Hey, come on.
You're torturing us here.
Let's down these beers
before Barbo wakes up.
Nail, get us some beers.
Come on then. Come with me.
- Hang on a second.
- Give us a break.
Look, they're about to play your song.
Don't miss it.
I'll catch it later then.
Now come on.
- What's going on?
- So how was the gig?
Fantastic. I'm
crazy for those guys.
- Well, what happened?
- I was going to talk to Cenk tonight.
- I guess they gave up on the idea.
- What happens now then?
They'll get married.
There you go, a classic TOA case.
Cenk's truly stupid.
- Look, the guy's scared.
- What of? He's not scared of marriage?
- How are you, Pelin?
- I'm fine. You?
So what are you going to do now?
Did you put it off a few days?
She won't say a word.
It's enough to drive you crazy.
We can find another
doctor if you like.
I think that's been taken care of.
Nail told her everything on the way here.
This is what we're going to do.
I'm going to go to one of Nil's Dad's
doctor friends for regular
Good. That's great.
Wait a second. How do you mean?
Regular check-ups? What's going on?
Well, we gave up on the idea.
So... We're getting married.
- I don't believe it! That's fantastic!
- Wow! Fabulous! I'm so happy!
- I don't get it. I never will.
- What's going on?
- It's fantastic news. You heard?
- Of course we did.
Don't think we got these beers in
at this time of night for nothing.
So you Nail,
you told them on the quiet.
Hang on. Don't blame him.
I figured from the way Cenk left.
I'd have been amazed if you hadn't.
You always figure everything out.
Yes, honeymoon people.
Here you go. Take a look.
Give them here.
- I don't believe it. It's amazing!
- Wow! Fabulous.
Guys, it's going to be fantastic,
you know.
- Anyone who bunks out is in big trouble.
- Are you crazy?
- It's a Blue Cruise for real.
- Sure. Nothing but the best.
You only go on honeymoon
once in your life.
How can you say that! You
won't come on mine when I get married?
Sure we will. Why not?
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's make this a tradition.
Rule number one, guys.
First thing the morning after the
wedding we cash in the gold and beat
Then here we come
Marmaris, Datga, Bozburun...
Wait a second. I want no rowdy behaviour
at the wedding. Got that?
Right. No getting soused and going AWOL.
Especially you two.
. - What do you mean? That's our speciality!
- Sure. Anatolian dances,
- Raki, vodka...
- Flying glasses...
And I'll smash those glasses
right over your head!
Hang on a second... Being on the bride's
side I have every right to be
Is that right?!
And who says so?
- Custom, tradition...
- Don't talk bullshit, G ven:
- Bye!
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
C
neyt... You can go. I'll finish up.
- See you, Abi.
- Good night.
- Kids, can I give you one for the road?
- Fantastic. Yeah!
Well, get those down you then.
- Ready.
- OK.
Look, Cenk was going to go
back to the house.
- We shouldn't be late for him.
- We won't be.
And if we are, he can wait.
He has a lot of waiting ahead anyway.
- Come on! So what if he has to wait?
- For goodness sake...
Come on now.
But I don't have one.
Mine's finished. I'm waiting.
It's on its way.
Come on, Barbo. Go for it.
- Fill her up, Abi.
- Right, now we can clink glasses.
What's the deal at
this time of night?
- Is something wrong?
- There's a bunch of guys on their way in.
So let's check the guys out then.
We're closed, guys.
You go over there.
We're closed, my friend.
- We're here for a beer. Then we'll leave.
- It'll have to be next time.
- But they're still drinking.
- Those are their last drinks.
They'll be leaving
as soon as they're done.
OK. So while they're having
one beer we'll have ten.
Hey, OK.
Don't keep staring over there.
A round of beers.
The jerk's still banging on
about one round.
- Barbo's pissed off.
- Sure he is. It was just us, wasn't it?
Just fuck it.
- I'm going to the loo before we leave.
- I'll come with you.
You really don't have to.
It's the sexpot...
What do you mean small?
What's too big for her I'll ram into you.
Some people have all the fucking luck.
That's luck for you.
And we don't have any of it.
Those dickless fags do.
What fucking dicks would those be?
All they've got is okra, you know?
Ok-ra.
- Thanks...
- Hey, I wanted a raki.
Bug-Eyes!
Stranger...
Help yourself.
Help yourself.
You want to start
this off with a beer.
Here, Trainee...
Help yourself!
- Shall we go?
- Yes, let's.
Soon as Nil's back, we'll go.
Go where? We're not
done with our beers yet.
- OK. Let's drink up quick then.
- OK.
Forget it! Why let a couple ofjerks
wreck the evening?
- We'll leave when the beers are finished.
- G ven:
- Nail. You're pissing me off again.
- The girls are uptight, Abi. Let's
- OK, Nil's back. Now let's go, guys.
- No, guys. We're not going.
We're not going anywhere
before these beers are finished.
Hey, look.
Hadji, he spilled his beer.
Get him another.
We've stopped serving.
Pull me another pint
while you're about it.
Cut it out, guys. We're closed.
You fucking cut it out!
Here's trouble for you...
If I say get me a beer,
you get me a beer!
Don't give me that!
There is no beer. Just get out of here.
- Trying to throw us out, are you, jerk?
- Barbaros Abi, is there a
What's it to you, moron?
You're the boss round here, are you?
Watch your mouth!
- Going to teach us how to behave, are you?
- Get the fuck out of here!
Hi, guys. Where were we?
Mr Prosecutor,
have the charges been read?
These are the charges.
Read them. You can
read and write, can't you?
- Come in!
- Mr Prosecutor, your tea.
Thank you.
Hey, Baba. What's the time?
You'll dream about me one night.
And you won't wake up.
It'll be so dark... You understand?
Pitch dark.
They've been read. It may not be
customary but I'd like to read them
What wimps!
Right in there bitching at us...
Bitching about watching our mouths,
about there being a problem...
Why the fuck
should we watch our mouths?
Trainee... Take that one
away. Over there.
- She's melt-in-the-mouth stuff...
- Come on. Pick her up.
I'll just go fuck her then, cousin.
Let's see what the time is.
Hey, it's so late.
But the bar's still open.
Of course it's open.
Justice isn't something invented
to ease people's consciences.
You may find, therefore,
that your conscience is far from eased.
An incident of this nature
should never have happened.
If only it hadn't happened.
One day perhaps
you'll be able to say that.
What's going on?
You're all chilled out.
I screwed the fucker.
Made her my wife.
There's more and more of us all the time.
How's it going to end?
Bug-Eyes!
Where's the thing round here?
Just do it anywhere.
Why bother looking?
Get away! I'm not
some kind of peasant.
Shut the fuck up!
OK, I get it. He's fucking her.
Wait, you fucking
psycho. Hold it.
Why bother trying to fight?
I've dealt with your fuck.
Now it's your turn.
Which is your boy then?
Don't you have a boyfriend?
Look, there's no place for lies
in our little romance. OK?
I'll only get mad.
I know who it is. Is
it him over there?
Can he fuck?
That's all I'm asking.
Are these shit-for-fags up to a fuck?
I'm going fuck your
goddamn brains out.
- Right?
- Which one, Abi?
- Right?
- Yeah, Abi.
Nice one! You're spot on.
What you need is a man like me.
A real man.
Why are you messing
with these shit-for-fags?
Cousin, there's not a fucking
thing here. I'm starving.
- Right. Beer, beer, more beer but...
- Don't be fucking ungrateful.
Here, there's some hot stuff
around to snack on.
Peel and eat.
Fucking bitch...
- What's up?
- Nothing.
What's the deal?
Couldn't get the little fucker up?
What was that?
Shut your fucking mouth, asshole!
What's going on?
- Wise up.
- He should watch his mouth then.
- What did I do? I was only kidding.
- Fuck off! Just watch your mouth.
- Where's the bitch?
- In there.
- Getting cleaned up.
- She won't get away? What about windows?
No, no.
She can't get away.
She can't get away.
Fuck you... Isn't there anyone left
with half a brain?
Go and see what that shit's done.
Son of a bitch...
Whoever goes in there
never comes out again.
I'll be back, sweetheart.
Goddamn motherfucker!
What the fuck did you do?
Asshole!
You killed the girl.
How are you going to fuck her now?
Come with me, son
of a bitch. Come on.
What the fuck's this?
What is this?
Motherfucker!
Fuck you!
Where are you off to?
We leave you
alone two minutes...
Where are you going, babe?
Don't move or you're dead.
OK?
Sly shits! Two minutes on their own
and they have phones and all that
Who the fuck was supposed watch them?
Wasn't it you, Trainee?
Are you out of your fucking mind?
We were clearing up after that cunt.
Shut the fuck up!
You're turning into a bunch of psychos.
Trainee, go get some fresh air or food
or whatever and come right back.
Trainee, get me two packs of cigs
while you're out.
What are you going to get?
I don't know, Abi.
Something from wherever's open.
- How about we have sausage and eggs?
- Who's going to make it?
I reckon one of these whores
knows how to cook...
- You know how to cook eggs, girl?
- OK.
Be careful! Don't let anyone
see you coming in or going out.
Can you cook, girl?
- 45!
- Yeah?
- What did you do to the bitch?
- She's in there.
- You didn't make a mess of her?
- She's in there.
Go and get her.
I want her where I can see her. Go on!
What have you done?
What the fuck have you done?
- Cousin...
- Kill the bastard.
Cousin, the son of a bitch
has broken my leg.
- Cousin!
- Stop screaming. You're OK.
Hey, OK. That'll do.
Leave the rest to Callus.
- Stop!
- Are you trying to kill me?
Here, Callus.
At that point, you turned up.
What happened next?
As I was coming down the stairs
Selim Abi was yelling.
I realised something was up.
I ran in.
I didn't do anything wrong.
I swear I didn't do anything wrong.
The man was dead when I got there.
He was lying in the middle of the bar.
They'd smashed his face in.
He was covered in blood.
Abi, what have you done?
You? You?
You're questioning me?
We fucked two bitches.
We slashed one of them with a razor.
We killed that son of a bitch.
Listen. Listen to what
I'm saying. We did it.
We're doing it.
And we'll carry on doing it.
Have you fucking got that?
Take away that bastard's carcass.
Cousin... Cousin... I'm in so much pain.
Let's go to a doctor, Cousin.
Sure, fucker. We'll get the doctor here
and have him examine everyone.
Get him drugged up.
Fucker!
Open your mouth! Open up!
Get that down you. Go on!
Fuck! All the
eggs are broken.
Fuck you!
What the fuck
are we supposed to eat now?
Get up.
Stop it! Don't!
Get up!
Get up!
Don't!
Move it!
What's going on?
All upset, are we?
Come here.
Sit down.
Hold out your wrist. Go on.
Which bitch do you fancy?
Which one would you have picked?
Look, kid. This lot are nothing like
the sagging cunts you get in
I'm not interested, boss.
OK. OK.
Now go check on that bitch
in the toilet.
Go on now. Go on, gorgeous.
Go on, nice eyes.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not going to do anything.
Can you pull up my trousers?
Is Pelin...
Dead?
She was pregnant.
Why?
- Talk us through.
- Through what?
What happened next...
As soon as we got there...
I said we shouldn't hang around.
We should leave, I said.
But Selim insisted we stayed.
He saw the girls and wanted them.
He had a gun, but I didn't know that.
He's the devil, you see.
He tempts people.
I sell kebabs. On the street.
One of them turned up one day
with a plate of rice, wanting a kebab.
I didn't serve him of course.
I sent him packing.
You don't show up at a
restaurant with a plate of rice.
- That's why they don't like me. I'm just...
- Stick to the point.
- We're not interested in your kebabs.
- Yes, sir!
Sorry, Mr Judge. Itjust slipped out.
Then he had us take the body away.
I went with one of the girls.
I went to the kitchen to stand over her
while she was doing the food.
That Trainee took one of the girls
and raped her in the toilet.
I couldn't do a thing!
I mean, I didn't. Ask the girl.
Quiet! Don't speak
unless you're asked to.
- What did you do in the kitchen?
- Nothing.
I stood over the girl
while she did the food.
This is a whole different place...
Every face is foreign...
We never met before...
This is a whole different street...
The walls are foreign...
We never exchanged
greetings before...
This is a whole different place...
The rooms are foreign...
We never made love before...
Only you are missing and my hopes...
Love is missing...
I'm scared...
I'm scared...
Your Honour!
What is it?
Something the matter?
I wanted to know
if the lawyer had asked to see you.
- No. Why?
- To try to get one of them off.
The youngest of them, for instance.
That doesn't happen
just because the lawyer wants it to.
- We've known each other for years.
- Yes.
You've looked over the case.
It's clear who the defendants are.
The evidence is there.
You've seen the kids.
Is this right and proper?
We have to do everything we can.
You see what the guys have done.
Did you look at their
criminal records?
None of them are angels
but their records are immaculate.
I know they are. That's my point.
What if Pelin, with the cut-up face,
had been your daughter?
What are you trying to say?
That's not how I do my job!
You expect me to reach a verdict
by imagining my family as the victims?
There are written codes of practice,
you know, Mr Prosecutor.
In that case, I should also be thinking,
'What if Selim had been my son? '
- I'm not some old-world Ottoman judge.
- Well, don't you have a
What'll happen when those guys
are let out on the street again?
You'll retire one day. So will I.
And what will we have to say
when we turn to the news on page three?
What do you expect me to do?
Hang the guys?
There are laws in this country.
There are jail sentences.
You think I let out the guys
that get locked up?
I'm talking aboutjustice. Shouldn't we
be discussing this between
These guys are monsters, animals.
Shame on us if we're still talking
about clean records.
You're overstepping the mark.
That's enough!
We need to talk.
Hey, look. This is nice.
Girls in bikinis and all that...
- Check out the locations, boss.
- What?
What you want to do
is climb on a boat with these girls.
Climb on a boat and climb on them.
Then cruise from cove to cove in and
Were you planning to go here too,
sweetheart?
Would you have come with me?
I asked you nicely so answer nicely.
Would you have come with me?
Where are you going?
Don't cry.
- What the fuck have you done?
- Turn it back on!
Well now...
There's this pitch there.
Not a real pitch exactly
but big enough to play football on.
There's goalposts and all that.
But... You know, lines and all that...
I mean, the ground's like a pitch.
So we... We thought
we'd have a game.
And then we all went out onto the pitch.
Us and the other guys...
These kids... They have a pitch set up
in the middle of the bar.
There's some shit going on here
for sure.
Well, is there?
You're fucked!
- I'm going to kill you!
- Shut the fuck up!
Rude bastard still doesn't know
how to talk nicely. What can I do?
Talk nicely or your ass is fucked!
What's the deal here?
Every night from 9.00 to 11.00
the clock starts ticking.
We play three-a-side.
Three-minute games.
- The winners get free beers.
- Free. Like you. For nothing.
Your fucking lives are for nothing.
- What's that?
- TOA.
I can see that, asshole.
What does it mean?
- Think over again.
- What do you fucking think over?
Everything... All the time.
How do you mean?
- How, for example... Me, for example...
- Directions... Directions for
These bastards can't live
without directions.
Look here, pimp.
Your directions are right here.
Genital wart...
We... We
live life without directions.
Life for us is indescribable.
It's about indescribable joy
and indescribable misery.
- Have you fucking got that?
- We don't take directions either.
Hey, come on...
Well, pimp. What are you then?
We're visitors...
We're just visitors in this world.
In other words,
we know we're going to die.
I'm going to fuck you.
Fuck you all!
I'm going to bury you here.
Get up!
Undo his feet.
We're going to have a game.
Hello, Muzaffer Amca.
This is Nil's father. Have
there been any developments?
I called round the hospitals.
They're not there.
It's unbelievable, Muzaffer Amca.
I went to the house. No one was there.
I went to the bar. It was closed.
I called. The phone just rang and rang.
I'm going out of my mind.
Can't any of them be tracked down?
Write down each of their names
and occupations.
I'll look into the
matter personally.
Play like real men and I won't
stick your legs up your asses.
We've kicked off.
- Bug-Eyes!
- Huh?
He's got the ball. He's
challenging his opposite number.
He's challenging his opponent.
What footwork there!
He's moving beautifully.
And Schilacci, it's a goal!
Ole! Ole! What a goal, baby!
What a goal? Did you like it?
Play, you bastards!
Hey, check this out.
Goal! Goal!
Fucking play, will you!
Wait, stop. Stop right there.
The ball may get through.
But you guys don't.
You think it's easy
scoring against us?
Look, what does it say there?
FOOTBALL IS NEVER JUST FOOTBALL
I'm going to fuck you all,
you motherfuckers.
Didn't I tell you to behave?
Everything was just
great, wasn't it?
Every night you had a good
time here with the girls.
This place was all yours.
Tonight the place mine!
Tonight, it's mine!
The place is mine!
Did I take up your fucking day?
It's that simple!
You think you can mess us around
with that prick brain of yours?
Fucking bambino!
You think you can mess me around?
You think you're fucking Maradonna
with that fancy footwork, that
Your feet are mine, fuck it!
Your prick brain's mine.
This place is fucking mine!
That bitch of yours
is mine too, fucker.
Get up!
Get up, you whore!
Move!
- Leave it, boss. Let's get out of here.
- Fuck off!
Yes, let's hear the case
for the defence. Go ahead.
She was a fucking virgin.
Didn't I tell you
their things were okra?
Give that here.
Boss, it's morning.
What are we going to do?
What do you mean,
what are we going to do?
- Come on. Let's go.
- Go where?
Where are we going to go?
All casual as if nothing's wrong...
You think they'd let us go?
You think they'd let us go, fucker?
There's a body in there. A bo-dy.
We can toss the body some place.
Toss the body and what do you do
with the lot that are still alive?
You think they wouldn't squeak?
There was a Trainee, a bug-eyed idiot...
A peasant whose leg got broken.
There was you.
And there was this psycho, Selim,
in charge of them all.
Tell me that's bullshit!
So what are we going to do?
We fucked up. We
have to finish the thing off.
We have to kill them all, one by one.
Then torch the place and leave.
- Fuck! Are you kidding?
- What do you mean, are you kidding?
Have we left anyone in good shape?
We've fucked them all.
We've smashed them all up.
That bastard went and slashed
the bitch, cut her to shreds.
You smashed that bitch's
head on the counter.
We all did away with
that sod of a barman's carcass.
Are you telling me after all that
you can't kill anyone?
Untie that lot.
Trainee!
Trainee!
Where the fuck are you?
- Where the fuck have you been?
- I had to take a leak, Abi.
Fuck your leak.
Now come here.
Untie that lot. Go on. Let's
hear their last requests then.
It's all your fault.
We said we should go.
I said the girls were uptight
and we should go.
I said the girls were uptight.
Fuck your beer, G ven: Let's go, I said.
Fuck your beer, G ven: The
girls are uptight, I said.
Sevgi said let's go. Nail said
let's go. It's all your fault, G ven:
It's all your fault.
- Shut it!
We're responsible for whatever
happens wherever we're hanging out.
Have you fucking got that?
Cousin!
That's enough chit-chat.
Yes. Who's going to kick off?
Bug-Eyes?
Fucker.
45?
You expect me to do everything.
OK. Fine then.
Let's go off to the ham-am...
Come and sit on my dag-ger...
I'd have fucked you
there and then...
But your ass is
too well worn...
Look, who's the lucky one?
You'd have died of blood loss anyway.
We'll just send you packing early.
- Let's go for it then.
- Boss...
I'll do it.
- Are you fucking serious?
- I'd even go fuck his mother.
Good man!
What a trainee! Here.
Come on, kid. Come on.
So you're going to kill us
and casually walk out of here.
Obviously you don't have a conscience.
It's not like you won't sleep
You took something from me
tonight. You stole something.
But I know it didn't
get to be yours.
- Come on!
- That's the kind of animal you are!
A destructive, full-of-shit animal!
There's a thousand ways of living life.
And you picked the shittiest
With a following of crooks, dogs,
assholes who do anything you want.
Are you taking the piss?
Shoot the guy!
You can't put quotas on love.
To love someone doesn't mean
you have to hate someone else.
But you have a small heart.
Everything about you is small.
You get that?
Every thing about you is small!
That's not the way to do it.
Aynur, I love you!
You do it like this.
Your Honour, if now's a good time,
I'd like to have a quick word with
I have a couple of things to say.
Please... Honestly, it'll be very
Yes. I'm listening.
As a matter of fact,
this lot have nothing in their defence.
But the trainee's situation is different.
It's in the girls' statements.
He didn't raped anyone and wasn't there
when the barman was killed
Nor could he bring himself to kill Nail.
And if what he told me is
He kept the others distracted
in the hope the police would turn up.
He also let Pelin escape.
Actually none of this is in his statements
because he's scared of the
He's different from the others.
And his verdict should be different.
There's no evidence but those
are the facts, you're saying.
Unfortunately, yes.
That's the way it is.
We'll have to see.
It's clear what we have to go on.
It's clear how we should proceed.
We'll look at the evidence
and the statements and make a verdict.
I'm bad. Bad! And I've got balls.
I do whatever I want.
- And now I'm going to kill you.
- Why are you doing this?
But you just don't
understand me, sweetheart.
Why do I show up here at the bar
halfway through the night?
Because if I show up any other time
the jerk on the door won't let me in.
Why won't he let me in?
Because of the way I look.
Because of the way I act.
Because of the way I speak.
He'd say I was some exhaust guy
and tell me to fuck off.
And let's say I did get in.
Then what would happen?
The morons there would stare
at me just like you did.
Wouldn't they say
what are these animals doing here?
What a great time we were
having before they showed up.
Of course they would.
Didn't you fucking say that?
Yes, you did.
Anyway... Where were we?
Here Trainee, take this.
Drop the gun! Police!
The verdict.
The verdict's been reached.
I'll read it out shortly.
But I want to ask you
a question... Why?
- Mr Judge... We wanted to be friends.
- Cut it out.
I'm giving you a life sentence.
Your friend gets the same too.
Put into language you'd understand,
you'll be in and out in five or six
You'll be in and out in a couple
of years. Go ahead, your Honour.
It is the verdict of this court
to sentence the accused Selim Ketenci...
Under Article 81 of the Turkish Penal Code
for the brutal torture and
Of victim Tarýk Güven Gölbaþý and
to deprive the accused for life...
Of public services as under Article
53 of the Turkish Penal Code...
Officer! Can you
stop there a minute?
OK. You can go.
You're a man of the law.
Know your limits. Don't overstep them.
Here, take this.
This phone will put you right in touch
with a bunch of hard-core guys...
Who are waiting for you
to make your decision.
Look... We're still trying to get over
what happened that night...
To get over everything
that vanished from our lives.
We still can't look each other
in the face.
Because we think back to that night.
And we're ashamed of what was done
Now I can't make a decision
given all that.
If we're trying on the one hand to act
as if they never entered our
We can't then hand them a death sentence.
We're not that kind of people.
Now when I think again...
I mean, when I
think things over again...
I'm now convinced that
what happened that day, in the bar...
Things deep down and close to the
heart should just stay there.
It's all been like a tough test.
The toughest kind.
Life should decide if we passed or
not. It'll do that anyway.
Fair enough, Nail.
I really miss you. I wish
we could be together all the time.
I want to hold you in
my arms and sleep.
Let's hold each other for days on end.
With no one else around.
Let the world be
forjust you and me.
- Just the two of us.
- Just the two of us.
Whenever we're not together
I start missing you right away.
So do I.
Excuse me.
What is the time?
Get lost! Get out of here!
What was he so steamed up about?
I'd have said if he asked.
Forget it!
Come on, we're late anyway.
