Bit of a twist?
Okay, what-what kind of twist?
What kind of case is it?
It's a contract law case.
Contract law? Oh, come on, man.
- We don't do no contract law here.
- REGGIE: Hell, nah.
That sound like a nap waiting to happen.
- Yeah. Yeah, we don't do no contract law.
- REGGIE: I mean, hell.
R-Right, but look, we understand
it's not necessarily your field,
but perhaps you could just hear him out.
I think you'll find the case compelling.
I am a, um, funeral director
from Biloxi, Mississippi.
I have a business there... Well, actually,
I have several businesses there.
I have eight funeral homes
and one burial insurance company.
We are a family business,
and have been for over a hundred years.
And we are not about to lose that
without a fight.
{\an8}After I returned from the war,
{\an8}my father passed the business to me,
{\an8}which I considered a sacred trust.
Annette and I were blessed
with 13 children,
and we intend for them
to carry the business into the future.
But about a year ago,
I ran into some financial trouble.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How can I help you?
We're here on behalf
of the state insurance commission.
Mr. O'Keefe, as a registered
burial insurance broker
in the state of Mississippi,
I'm sure you're aware
you're required to maintain
a certain minimum funds
in your account at all times.
Well, yes. Of course I'm aware.
Insurance regulators?
You gotta be kidding me.
What'd they say they want, exactly?
Truth is, I may have gotten myself
into a lot of trouble.
Trouble?
Jerry...
I've been your lawyer, what,
coming up on 30 years?
Was your friend even before that.
You and I both know
I've been in debt
up to my neck for years,
trying to make this business strong,
make it last,
so I have something to leave my children.
(sighs)
Let's not panic just yet.
I get how stressful this is,
but I'm pretty sure we can
find a way out of it.
Hold up a second.
Excuse me, son.
- Do you want another drink?
- No, no.
Whenever you get a chance,
could I get another bourbon over here?
- Yeah.
- Yes, sir.
So, look,
have you considered
selling off part of the business?
No.
Just part of it. Okay?
Well, I'm not saying I want to,
but if I did,
where would I find a buyer?
Canada, actually.
They made an inquiry.
Loewen Group? Oh, yeah.
They've been on a pretty significant
acquisition spree.
Going all across the country,
buying up every independently owned
funeral chain they can get their hands on.
These guys, they're really big players.
Now, you know how I feel
about these big corporations, now.
Yes, I do. But all I'm saying is
it's an option.
And it's out there.
Might be a way out.
You could think about it.
- (plane flying overhead)
- (car horns honking)
(indistinct announcement over P.A.)
Jerry.
Perfect timing.
- Hey, you need a hand with that?
- Oh, no, I got it.
Hey, so, listen.
You're sure about this, right?
No, I've given this a lot of thought,
and I believe this is
the right thing to do for my family.
All righty, then.
Next stop, Vancouver.
You ready to go inside?
No, we got to wait for Hal.
- Who?
- I told you about Hal.
He's a friend of my son's from college,
very bright young man
just getting started out
as a lawyer and, uh...
Well, hell, here he comes now.
Recently passed the bar exam.
Hungry for experience.
Who, which one?
That tall kid?
Hey, hey, sorry.
So sorry, Mr. O'Keefe. Um...
My taxi just dropped me off
at the wrong terminal, so...
Oh, don't worry about it. Halbert Dockins,
I want you to meet Mike Allred.
Really great to meet you, Mr. Allred.
I'm very excited
to be a member of the team.
- Hi, there. Nice to meet you, too.
- Yeah.
So you're a lawyer?
(chuckles) Uh, yeah.
Well, that's just great.
Good for you, son.
I'll see you guys inside.
Come on. We're going to Canada.
{\an8}BOB:
I work for Ray Loewen.
{\an8}He's really looking forward
to meeting you.
As I'm sure you can gather,
Ray's a very hands-on kind of guy.
One of the only CEOs in the industry
who likes to meet with
every seller personally.
Hey, Ray!
Allow me to introduce Mr. Jeremiah O'Keefe
- and his colleagues.
- It is a pleasure to meet you, Jerry.
So, boys, how do you like the way we do
business up here in Canada? (laughing)
Come on on board. Get you a drink.
(seabirds screeching)
BOB:
At present, we own 1,115 funeral homes,
427 cemeteries,
354 insurance companies.
RAY:
My strategy is simple.
Buy as many funeral homes as I can
and put myself in a position
for what I like to call
the Golden Era of Death.
Sorry?
It's when all the baby boomers
across the U.S.
finally reach their age of demise.
RAY:
Resulting in a minimum 60% increase
in death rates nationwide.
Do you have any idea how many people
are living in the U.S.,
right now,
over the age of 65?
51 million.
(Bob and Ray laugh)
JEREMIAH:
That sounds kind of cynical to me.
Aren't you worried
about losing sight of your customer?
RAY:
My customer?
What customer?
My customers are dead guys.
(laughing)
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding, Jerry.
Look, the more funeral homes I own,
the more money I make,
the more I am able to meet the demands
of my customer.
And provide for his... growing needs.
Maybe it's time that we drop
all this chit-chat
and start talking about a deal.
What do you say, gentlemen?
I'm interested to hear
what you have in mind, Ray.
My understanding
is that you're having a bit of trouble
with the state regulators down there.
How'd you come to that understanding?
RAY:
You own... what?
Nine homes across the state?
JEREMIAH:
Eight.
I own eight funeral homes
across the state.
And my insurance business, of course.
So what about this?
You sell me three of your homes,
at a fair market value
to be agreed upon later.
Then, not only do you get to keep
the bulk of your assets,
but it would also provide you
with more than enough fresh cash
to deal with the regulators.
Now, there's something else
I want out of this deal.
I make most of my profits
from selling burial insurance.
There's no way I can survive
if you have a monopoly
on that, too, so what I propose
is that I sell you
three of my funeral homes,
fair market value...
...but you're going to have to promise,
here and now,
to no longer sell burial insurance
in southern Mississippi.
Okay.
So does this mean we have a deal?
I'll get my lawyers
to draw up the contracts
so we can get it done immediately.
What the hell is taking so long?
We closed on this deal, um...
Coming up on four months now.
They keep trying to re-trade the terms.
When we left Vancouver,
they said it would take 30 days max.
- It just doesn't make sense.
- I don't know, makes perfect sense to me.
MIKE:
Why?
Have you considered the possibility
that Loewen has no intention
of closing this deal at all?
Son, with all due respect,
you don't have the faintest idea
what you're talking about.
I think I do.
Think about it.
The longer he stalls,
the worse you're screwed.
First, the insurance commission
takes your license,
effectively destroying your livelihood,
until, sooner or later, you have no choice
but to file for bankruptcy.
Now not only does Loewen get
the three homes,
he can actually buy your entire business
out from under you
at yard-sale prices.
You really think
he's trying to bankrupt me?
Hell, he can't do that;
I got a signed contract.
It was only signed on our end.
With no closing date attached.
And, by the way, I heard Mr. Loewen
is actually still selling insurance
in the region.
Oh, come on.
Stop with the conspiracy theories.
Son, I'm sorry,
but you really are paranoid.
Okay.
Um...
would you mind doing me a favor?
Would you mind stop calling me son?
I am not your son, Mike.
Whoa.
Just take it easy, okay?
You really want to be taken seriously
- as a lawyer in this town?
- Okay. Who says I'm not?
Enough of that, y'all.
Do you really think Mr. Loewen has the
intention of running me into the ground?
I do.
Why the hell should he be
on our clock anyway?
Well, that's it. I'm gonna sue him.
You've never sued anybody before
in your whole life.
Well, I'm liable to,
just about any minute now.
Yeah. Well, you think 75 years of age
is a good time to start suing people?
Old men don't file lawsuits.
The way I see it, if somebody tries
to take advantage of you,
and you know it's wrong,
it don't matter how old you are.
This fellow tried to bully me
out of business.
And I don't think
I should be expected to stand for it.

ROBIN LEACH (over TV):
The thrills continue with another
opulent episode on
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.
{\an8}You won't believe
the amazing journey of famed
{\an8}personal injury lawyer Willie E. Gary,
{\an8}a man who refused to accept
a life sentence of poverty
{\an8}because he believed in the American dream.
Born to a family of migrant sharecroppers
working the sugarcane fields of Florida,
life wasn't always a bed of roses
for Willie Gary.
I just always had this burning desire
to be something, you know?
And I-I knew I was going
to make something of myself.
LEACH:
And make something of himself he did,
as now Willie regularly wins
multimillion-dollar cases...
Are you suggesting I hire this guy
as one of my lawyers?
Seems like a crazy idea,
but this guy wins cases. I mean...
{\an8}LEACH: He not only owns
his own private 737 jet,
{\an8}called Wings of Justice,
{\an8}he also lives the high life
in a 50-room mansion
{\an8}along the luxurious Florida coast.
But Willie can't take credit
for the decorating,
as that job belongs
to Willie's childhood sweetheart,
his gorgeous and alluring wife Gloria.
GLORIA:
One thing
that I always try
to remind Willie of is to...
- is to never forget where he came from.
- Mm.
- Stay humble.
- LEACH: Yes,
"humble" is Willie Gary's middle name.
Don't never let nobody tell you
you can't do something, okay?
Willie Gary told you that.
Give me a pound.
LEACH:
Never forgetting his roots...
(tape stops)
Believe it or not, he's got
an absolutely flawless trial record.
He supposedly hasn't lost a case
in over 12 years.
What does he know about contract law?
This is a contract law case.
The case was filed down in Hinds County.
That's a three-to-one Black/white ratio.
That means there's a 70% chance
we'll get a Black judge,
and if we do go to trial,
likely a Black jury as well.
- So what?
- With all due respect,
you-you can't put a guy like Mike Allred
in front of a Black jury.
Why the hell not?
He has been my attorney for 30 years.
He knows contract law better than anybody.
You're really gonna
make me spell this out.
Um...
He literally reeks self-satisfied,
good ol' boy Southern bigotry.
I mean, a Black jury sees
a guy like that coming...
The idea of us pandering to a jury
like that, Hal, it's not...
It... (sighs)
This is not a discrimination suit.
You and I both know
that race has nothing to do with this.
I happen to know, for a fact,
that Mr. Gary is trying a case
down in Florida this week.
What if... what if...
you and I went down there,
just for the day,
and try to meet him in person?
Essentially, we just want
to hold the Loewen Group
responsible for their actions.
WILLIE:
Nah, nah, nah. That ain't what you want.
What you want to do
is you want to make 'em pay.
- REGGIE: Make 'em hurt, make 'em pay.
- Yeah, yeah.
So, how much money y'all trying
to get, hmm?
- JEREMIAH: Uh, $6 million.
- $6 million.
That's full, fair market value
plus damages,
and I've already filed a civil claim
in Hinds County, Mississippi.
HAL:
Well?
What-what do you think, Mr. Gary?
Do you like the case?
I'm gonna give you my personal opinion.
Honest.
Look, Mr. O'Keefe, I'm sorry for
what this Loewen guy did to you...
he sounds like he's a big asshole
and everything like that...
but, um, this ain't no Willie Gary case.
It just ain't. It ain't...
It ain't a Willie Gary case.
Uh, wait, what-what do you mean?
Why-why not?
It ain't a Willie Gary case
- 'cause it ain't for Willie Gary.
- No, but...
I'm sorry,
what is a "Willie Gary case," then?
- I don't...
- In other words, what he's saying is
a Willie Gary case is the type of case
where I have the upper hand.
Where I feel that I can take
this case to trial. Understand?
- All the way.
- And-and once I get 'em in that trial,
I mean, y'all seen my tape.
When I get 'em in front of...
especially in front of people
that-that look like me...
I'm-a play 'em like a symphony.
Mm. Mozart.
A Willie Gary case is
where I could take that judgement
and push it all the way up,
to the heavens if I need to,
and get as much money as I can
for my client.
Uh, what he's saying is,
a Willie Gary case
is a case we know we can win.
This case... not so much.
Matter of fact,
your case a little bit iffy.
And, uh...
the other thing is this.
Don't take this the wrong way, but, uh...
He, uh, he's... you're white... he's white.
And I don't have white clients.
I've never had any, so...
No offense or anything like that,
but this is just unusual for me.
No offense taken, Mr. Gary.
That guy's too rich and famous
for us, Halbert.
Uh-huh.
Um, you know what, Mr. O'Keefe?
Just, um...
- What?
- You know, just-just give me one second.
- All right?
- Where you going?
I'm-I'm gonna talk with him one more time.
G-Give me five minutes, okay?
The green light scenario,

the one juror, uh, uh...
What'd she have on?
I'd have maybe looked at her
a little bit longer.
You know, gave her some eye contact.
- Sometimes you got to romance them.
- Listen, I'm not...
- That's the thing, I don't know that...

- Hmm.

That's it?

- Yeah, man.
- Hal, don't nobody give a shit except them.

All right. All right. How about this?
Okay, um...
In 1976,
Jerry was serving as a two-term mayor
in his hometown of Biloxi.

And he stopped 'em
from buying white sheets.
(Willie and Reggie laughing)
- Shit, man.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah. KKK, man.
REGGIE:
You sound like you in love with him, man.
(laughing)
No, that's not my point. I'm saying we're
hopefully trying the case in Hinds County.
- There's a three-to-one...
- Hold-hold on. Let me stop you, Hal.
Now, listen, Hal, I like you...
I-I think you come from good stock...
but you got to understand
how we work here.
One, we don't do contract law.
- Two, we don't have no white clients.
- REGGIE: No.
And three, that ain't enough money.
My, not enough money.
It ain't enough money, Hal.
You know, I-I-I love you, man,

in this country.
Hmm.
I'm talking about the $20 billion a year
death care industry.
There are two huge corporations moving in

and the Loewen Group is one of them.
Now, what they did to Jerry
is truly terrible, but...
I have a feeling it's just... it's-it...
No. I know. It's the tip of the iceberg.
- Hmm.
- HAL: Can I keep going?
Sure. Shit.
Well, that's where you should've started.
You guys try all these
$80 million cases, and...
and you have your private jet and
all that, I get it, that's fine, but...
Yeah, I do. Wings of Justice.

Well, I've never heard of him.
Was this your idea,
by the way, Mr. Dockins?
- Yes.
- No, it was not his idea,
it was mine, and I realize, Mike,
it might piss you off,
me bringing on additional counsel
like this, but...
MIKE:
Piss me off? Not at all.
Doesn't piss me... Do I seem pissed off?
I'm not pissed off.
Hell, it's your money,
you can do what you want to with it,
I just think you're making a big mistake.
I am trying to put us
in the best possible position
in the event we end up going to trial.
Got it.
Except we're not going to trial.
Seriously, what's so special
about this guy, anyway?
Hal and I went over to Florida to
watch him try a case in front of a jury,
and I want to tell you,
this man can absolutely,
(laughing):
positively galvanize a jury.
(laughing)
Yes, sir.
Well...
if you believe in him that much,
then sure, okay, I'll work with him.
I've partnered up before.
Just as long as it's clear
I'm still lead attorney.
Appreciate you being a good sport
about this, Mike.
No problem.
So what time is he supposed
to get here, anyway?
You know, actually,
I think this is them now.

Afternoon, gentlemen. How you feeling?
You good? Huh? Good, good, good.
For all y'all that don't know who I am,
my name is Willie Gary.
Tell 'em who you are.
Now, I done brought a couple of partners
of mine from my firm up here from Florida
to help y'all win this case.
And for all of y'all who are unfamiliar
with the Willie Gary style of litigation,
let me break it down to you.
We 'bout to go to war.
'Cause that's what I think litigation is.
Litigation is war.
It's a battle, a battle to the death.
And I'm not talking about
no bullshit, either;
I'm talking about some
Jean-Claude Van Damme ass-kicking shit.
Now I know y'all looking at me crazy,
but that's how I like to get.
And if we don't get crazy
with these motherfuckers,
I'm telling you, this Loewen Group?
They're powerful.
Got a lot of money,
got a lot of influence.
They have everything that we don't.
But we not gonna let them intimidate us.
'Cause I'm not intimidated.
Now, it ain't no secret.
For the past 12 years,
I have not lost a case.
And why is that?
Can you tell me why?
'Cause I hate to lose.
I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!
I'd rather somebody pull a gun on me
and blow my head off
than to lose a case.
Now, that being said...
...there's one thing I'm-a tell you
I'm not gonna bend on.
I do not plan on settling this case.
- We don't do that, no.
- MIKE: Excuse me.
Anyone mind if I say something here?
- Go ahead, Mike.
- Mr. Gary,
when it comes to the matter of settling,
I'm afraid that's not at all
the strategy we've developed here.
In fact, I've already drafted
a letter to Mr. Loewen
offering to settle at $8 million.
Though, just between us here in this room,
we'd probably be willing to drop
to seven if need be.
WILLIE:
Well, Mike, thank you for the update...
appreciate that...
but, unfortunately, things have changed.
We're not settling.
No matter what you said,
the discussion is still on the table
and will remain so until I've decided
what the best course is.
Huh.
Till you decided, huh?
What's going on here, Mike?
Hmm? Who's in charge?
No, seriously, who's in charge?
'Cause you done have Willie Gary
come down here to take over the case
and now here you're telling me
what you're gonna do.
I said we're not settling the case
and that comes from the lead attorney.
- Come again?
- Come again what?
What's the matter?
You need your ears checked or something?
Excuse me, sir.
- No, you're not.
- Mike, you raise a finger to me,
- you'll get your ass whupped in here.
- Boss, calm down.
- MIKE: Believe me, Mr. Gary, you are not lead attorney.
- AL: Come on, settle down.
- Then what am I, then?
- May I remind you
- you are in my town...
- Your town?
- ...sitting at my conference table...
- Every town I go to, Mike, is my town.
- ...across the table from my client.
- Evidently it ain't your town,
- or they wouldn't have called me.
- JEREMIAH: Gentlemen. Gentlemen.
Gentlemen, could y'all
let the temperature down a little bit?
WILLIE:
I didn't come here to fight you, Mike.
- MIKE: What?
- I said, I didn't come here to fight you.
I came here to get a job done.
Now, Mr. O'Keefe...
Last I checked, he wants to win this case.
Not toot his ass up in the air
for a funky little $8 million.
Like a bitch.
MIKE:
Jesus Christ, Jerry. What's going on?
I think we ought to give him a chance.
Did you hear that speech he just gave?
He has no idea what he's doing.
He hasn't lost a case in 12 years.
For personal injury cases.
He clearly has no idea about real law,
about contract law.
What about lead attorney?
You're not considering
giving him lead attorney.
Yeah.
I am.
We good?
(sighs) Yeah.
Mike, you good?
All right, since we're all good,
uh, does anybody here mind, uh,
taking some dictation?
Cynthia, would you mind
taking dictation for Mr. Gary?
WILLIE:
All right, Cynthia. I sure appreciate it.
All right.
Address to Mr. Ray Loewen,
Chairman, Loewen Group.
Dear Mr. Loewen,
my name is Willie E. Gary.
I've just been appointed lead counsel
in the suit brought against you
by Jeremiah O'Keefe.
In regards to the prior settlement,
the offer you received of $8 million,
I hereby rescind that offer.
As of the date of this new letter we have,
the new offer is
in the amount of $100 million.
- Whoo. That's what I'm talking about.
- (scattered laughter)
Did he just say $100 million?
- As in eight zeros?
- $100 million.
Why don't y'all just relax?
Hear what I'm saying?
It's literally $94 million more
than our original claim.
Sounds to me like your original claim
was about $94 million short.
Uh, yeah, Mr. Gary, perhaps you could
- help us understand...
- MIKE: $100 million?
It's absurd and you know it.
What you trying to do, destroy this case?
Mike, anybody ever tell you
you got balls the size of a garden slug?
W-Willie, I'm afraid that I agree
with everybody's concerns.
That's a hell of a lot of money.
We throw out a number like that,
we're gonna humiliate ourselves.
WILLIE:
Listen, I understand how you feel, Jerry.
But you got to trust me, okay?
- Mm-hmm. Trust him.
- Okay?
Everybody's got to trust me.
- All right?
- REGGIE: Amen.
Now, Cynthia, where were we?
{\an8}MAN:
"Starting as of the date of this letter,
{\an8}"our new settlement demand is now
$100 million."
- (men laughing) - (man whistles)
- MAN 2: Oh, what?
MAN 3:
Oh, come on. You got to be kidding me.
- $100 million?
- MAN 4: Who the hell does he think he is?
- MAN 2: Is he crazy?
- MAN: Eight zeros, did you count that?
- Eight zeros.
- There's no way that is not a joke.
- That is a joke.
- It looks like a fucking dozen eggs.
(laughter)
No joke.
Jesus Christ, this O'Keefe guy,
he's a piece of work, no?
Yeah.
Who is this clown he's hired as a lawyer?
Apparently, some guy
by the name of William Gary.
Thank you, Bob, I also read the letter.
But my question is,
who is he?
What's his story?
Where did O'Keefe find him?
From what we could dig up,
he's this kind of flashy
personal injury lawyer,
uh, out of Florida.
- Ambulance-chaser type.
- Personal injury?
This is a contract dispute.
Why the hell would he hire
a personal injury lawyer
for a contract dispute?
Maybe they don't have any regular lawyers
(Southern accent):
down in backwater Mississippi.
You should talk like that more.
Turns out, the case was filed
in some remote county
in the lower region of the state,
called Hinds County.
RAY:
Yeah? So?
So, Hinds County also happens to be
one of the poorest, and about 70%, uh...
...Black.
Oh.
So that's why he was hired.
Because he's Black.
Gary's Black.
He's an African American man.

- Well,
when I was a young husband,
young father,
me and my wife, we had,
you know, we had a little money,
so we had a little landscaping business.
Real nice, too.
You know, kept-kept all the yards...
fantastic.
But then my wife was like,
"You know what?
I want to move into a bigger place."
I said, "Well, all right.
Let's do that, then."
And so... (inhales)
...got the paper, saw this ad.
Three-bedroom apartment, man.
Real nice.
Uh, nice new complex.
Over there in a white neighborhood
at, uh, Raintree.
So I said, "Yeah, that's what,
that's what we need."
So I called the owner, I said, "Hey, man.
"Me and my family are looking
for a new place.
We want to come to where you are."
I said, "Do you have any vacancies?"
And he says, "Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I got plenty of vacancies, you know?
"Matter of fact, uh, at the end
of the month, you can move in.
Get your lease."
We all looking forward to that day, man.
I mean, we just excited.
You know, just brand-new beginnings,
if you would.
So when the day comes,
I pack everybody in the car.
I got the-the-the, the boys in there,
I got my-my wife,
I even got my dog in there, man.
And we just happy, man. We happy.
Uh, and we listening to gospel music.
You know, singing, rocking and rolling.
(sighs)
But, um...
when we get there, guy comes out.
I said, "How you doing?" He barely speaks.
He says, "What do you need?"
I said, "I'm the one that, uh,
called you about the vacancies."
He said, "What vacancies?"
I said, "I'm Willie Gary.
I called you about the... the vacancies."
He says, "Oh.
We don't have no more vacancies."
What'd you do?
Tell you what I wanted to do.
Wanted to hurt him.
I mean...
disrespecting me like that
in front of my boys, man.
My boys look up to me.
I'm their everything.
What-what do I tell 'em?
That...
they daddy ain't good enough
to be in an apartment?
What I tell my queen?
That we not good enough?
But I didn't act out.
What I did was,
I went back to that hotel,
and I opened up the phone book.
Now, I hadn't even thought about
being a lawyer until this happened.
I opened it up and I...
First law school I saw,
I said, "Mm. I'm going right there."
And I did it.
I enrolled, worked hard,
I graduated, I passed the bar.
And I got my own practice.
And the first thing I did was
went down to Raintree Apartments
and bitch-slapped him with a five-count
discriminatory practices lawsuit.
(chuckles)
Take that for your vacancies.
You a fighter.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm a fighter.
You are, too, Jerry.
You're a fighter, man.
You know why I say you're a fighter?
Going up against
this big Loewen Group, man...
small business owner, man,
that's something, doc.
That's why we connect.
What made you want to do it?
'Cause he tried to mess with the one thing
that means the most to me in life:
being able to leave something behind
for my children
and my grandchildren when I go.

Well, we keep the strategy simple.
Firmly cementing
the validity of the document
as a contract in the jury's mind.
That's definitely gonna be
the defense strategy, too.
Except they'll be focused on proving
how it's not a contract.
Okay, look,
we got to be honest about this.
They're likely gonna be
a lot better at this than we are,
considering this is
their area of expertise.
REGGIE: I-I say we just forget
about all that contract mumbo jumbo.
Bog the jury down
with a whole bunch of information
that we know they ain't interested in.
CHRIS:
Personally, what I think we gotta do...
what we gotta prove, rather...
is motive.
We center our argument
squarely on the issue
of Loewen Group stalling on closing.
And show what they had to gain from it.
- Uh, I'm not so sure.
- What? What, Hal?
- What-what you ain't sure about?
- DASHAAN: What? Hal?
HAL: What I mean is,
I'm not so sure we can actually prove
that the Loewen Group had motive.
Right? Unless we have
some kind of internal company memo.
Or someone just openly admits it.
Like, how do you actually prove
that the stalling was intentional?
Well, we're obviously never
going to be able to prove that.
Truth is, we don't have a snowball's
chance in hell of winning this case.

Nah, that's murky territory.

Doesn't matter.

Oh, hell nah.
Opportunity to be the lead counsel
on the defense
or a opportunity to be
the lead prosecutor,
which one do you choose?
Oh, that's... that's a tricky one.
- Yeah, I know. It's tough, it's tough.
- Defense.
His ass is guilty.
And I've never defended someone
who I knew was guilty before.
You know what they say:
Lawyer's got to try that at least once.
Remember these words:

I have this reoccurring dream

All rise, all rise.
The court is now in session,
pursuant to the adjournment.
Hear ye, hear ye.
All persons having business
with this honorable court, draw near.
Give your attention
and you shall be heard.
The Honorable Judge James E. Graves,
circuit county judge
for the First Judicial District
of Hinds County, Mississippi, presiding.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
How y'all doing?
Thank you for being here.
This case here is really about
the oldest sin known to man.
MAME:
Contracts.
Plain and simple.
Now, Mr. Gary would have you believe
that this case is about...
- Greed.
- And while that sounds,
uh, entertaining and a bit dramatic...
We know for a fact
that the deal had already been approved
by Loewen and his board.
They crafted every single aspect,
outlined it,
and put it down in writing.
That's a contract.
How can it be a binding contract
between two parties
if one of the parties
didn't sign the contract?
Y'all, these people lie.
That's what it boils down to.
So why did Mr. O'Keefe
have such a-a-a panic,
such an urgency,
such a desperation
for this deal to close?
Why?
Well, because everything in his life
hinged on this deal.
Everything.
For the Loewen Group, not so much.
They had one goal in mind.
Stall him out.
Stall him out.
It wasn't personal.
He just got impatient.
(whispering)
(bell tolling)
(bell continues tolling)
MAN:
In fact, there is such a thing
uh, as an anticipatory breach of contract.
And this is when,
though the actual breach
has not yet occurred,
one of the involved parties,
heretofore referred to
as the "soon to be breaching party,"
will not fulfill their obligations
set forth by the terms of the agreement.
When a situation like this arises,
- it is my opinion that...
- (sighs)
...it is well within the means of dispute
for this contract.
- Wake your ass up!
- Whoa!
- Whoa.
- Jesus Christ.
Wake up!
What are we doing?
We sit up in these books,
talking about contracts every single day.
For what?
We putting 'em to sleep.
We done lost our connection,
lost our edge.
And what do I get from y'all? Nothing.
I gotta make the decision.
I'm-a put Jerry on.

You said it yourself. He's a good witness,
he's honest, he's-he's-he's,
he's a family man,
he's-he's a war hero.
To civil-civil rights.
Everything he did for Black folk?
We put him in front of that jury,

WILLIE:
Let's talk about some of your values.
Because, if I'm not mistaken, Jerry,
you an eight-time decorated hero.
You got the Air Medal, the Navy Medal.
You got the, you got the Flying Cross.
And you did all of that
in the sacrifice for your country.
Well, I don't think war's anything
to be celebrated.
But I did serve my country
and quite proudly.
Hmm. Thank you for your service.
But you didn't stop there.
You came back to your county,
you took over the family business,
and then, uh, you did what I call
you jumped out of the frying pan
and into the fire, man.
You wanted to be in politics, didn't you?
You ran for mayor
in your home town in Biloxi.
I ran twice and served two terms as mayor,
from 1974 until 1982.
And I understand, in one of those terms,
that a very friendly group of people
came to visit you.
The Ku Klux Klan.
Objection, Your Honor.
What is the relevance
to this line of questioning?
- Overruled, Ms. Downes.
- MAME: We are in a case about contracts,
Your Honor.
You may answer that question.
I denied them a permit
to demonstrate in Biloxi.
You told the Ku Klux Klan
in Biloxi, Mississippi, "No."
Now, flying warplanes is one thing,
but to tell the Klan "no" at that time,
that's a different type of bravery.
Jerry, I've gotten
an opportunity to know you.
You and your family.
But these good folks here have not.
I just want to ask you,
what are your values?
What is important to you?
Mr. O'Keefe.
Good day. How are you?
JEREMIAH:
I'm doing well, thank you.
You are? Good.
(pages rustling)
Uh...
having just listened to the testimony
you gave,
I think it's fair to say
that the real, material substance
centered on character.
Would you agree?
Yes. I-I agree.
I couldn't hear that. Can you speak up?
I said yes, ma'am, I agree.
MAME:
Okay, character.
Let's talk about character.
The overall insinuation
being made is that,
while you are a man of honor,
of strong moral principles,
according to you, my client is not.
I think Mr. Loewen and I have
very different approaches to...
as to how to deal with people in business.
Ah. "In business."
Yes. Right, okay.
Something I'm curious about...
How did you end up needing to sell
those funeral homes to Mr. Loewen?
Well, I had run into a little bit
of financial trouble.
What kind of financial trouble?
Huh?
Because I'm, uh, pretty sure
the actual reason you so desperately
needed to sell at the time that you did
is because the Mississippi
state insurance commission
was about to revoke your license.
Is that correct?
As a matter of fact, your license
to sell insurance
in the state of Mississippi
is currently under suspension.
Can we agree that
that is a true statement,
- Mr. O'Keefe?
- JEREMIAH: No, we cannot.
Because it's a lot more
complicated than that.
Enlighten me.
How is it more complicated?
Was your license suspended
- or was it not?
- Objection, Your Honor,
- on the simple fact that she's just angry.
- Overruled.
- MAME: It's a yes or no question.
- We already knew
- that he was in financial trouble.
- MAME: He said "overruled."
Overruled.
MAME:
Well, the real truth here is that
you lost your license
because you got involved in some
shady savings and loans business deal
with a man that, if I'm-I'm not mistaken,
is currently in jail right now.
- WILLIE: Your Honor, objection.
- MAME: Can I ask you something?
WILLIE:
This is not on trial here today.
- GRAVES: Overruled.
- MAME: Was the money that you used
to finance this deal,
was that money yours?
I was responsible for that money.
You used other people's money.
Actually, you used your clients' money
to finance your involvement
in said "business deal"
with a now-convicted felon.
- Am I correct?
- WILLIE: Objection, Your Honor.
Am I correct, Mr. O'Keefe?
- WILLIE: This has nothing to do with this case.
- Overruled.
- Am I correct, Mr. O'Keefe?
- That's not how I would characterize
- this at all.
- MAME: I mean, is it possible
that this entire case
stems from jealousy?
WILLIE: Objection, Your Honor.
We're talking about emotions?
- Jealousy?

- Mr. O'Keefe...
- GRAVES: Overruled.
...you said yourself that
you and Mr. Loewen have
very different ways of doing business,

for 13 years.

Just... in all that time,
I saw a lot, you know,
about how that company operates.
Before we go any further,
I just have to ask you:
would you be willing to testify?
MIKE:
Mrs. McGrath, hi.
How you doing this afternoon?
Um, very well, thank you.
MIKE:
That's fine. That's just fine.
Mrs. McGrath, would you mind telling us
how long you worked as an employee
for the Durbin and Sons Funeral Home
in Southaven, Mississippi?
LORRAINE:
Um, I worked at that funeral home
for about 13 years before I quit.
MIKE:
Mm-hmm.
And did you witness any transfer
of ownership during this time period?
LORRAINE:
Um...
(clears throat)
Uh, uh, Durbin and Sons was bought
by the Loewen Group
sometime around 1990.
And I was there during that time.
And did you notice any changes
in the way the company was run
after the Loewen Group took over?
Uh, the most significant was, uh,
how they implemented this,
this policy of-of raising prices
on certain items
in areas where they, uh,
didn't have any, any competition.
Mostly, this turned out to be, um,
poor areas,
where there was a lot of-of poverty.
Could you give us an example
of this type of selective pricing?
There was this one, uh,
casket in particular I remember.
The, um, the Wilbert Copper Trubune.
It, uh, was supposed to retail for $750.
Uh, which it did in-in some places,
like, say, Madison.
Uh, but then in other places,
like Corinth,
which, as you know, is-is very poor...
Yes, of course.
Over there, they hiked the price up
to something crazy.
Like three times
what it was supposed to cost.
Just because they could.
They knew customers didn't have
anywhere else to go.
So, basically,
if I understand you,
the Loewen Group was involved in
a form of selective price gouging.
Of what?
Objection. Your Honor,
how could the witness possibly know
the intentions of people

in your 30 years of practicing law,

any kind of misunderstanding as to what
that document actually was?
MIKE:
No, sir.
It was extremely clear to everyone
exactly what it was.
It was a contract.
Contract. It's a contract.

- No, Mike, you can't do that.

MIKE: If I even dare to step foot
in that courtroom again,
the jury's never gonna see me,
they're just gonna see
a guy with a sheet on his head.
Listen, listen. We dug a hole.
We dug a hole, but we can dig out of it.

my presence is just gonna
hurt the case more,

HAL:
Thank you all for taking the time
to speak with us, Mr. Soames.
Everyone.
What can you tell us about the deal
that the Loewen Group made with
the National Baptist Convention?
Well, nothing good ever come out of it.
At least not for Black folks.
That's the truth.
'Bout a year back,
the Loewen Group connected with
some of the top leadership
of the NBC.
- National Baptist Convention?
- RUBEN: Yes, sir.
One of the largest single branches
of the Black church.
They represent over 33,000 churches
and more than eight million members.
Anyway, they made a proposal to the NBC,
told 'em that
if they could convince the Black church
to endorse the Loewen Group
as their death care provider of choice,
then they'd turn some of its members
into salesmen.
Like, uh, teach 'em how to sell everything
from graves to crypts to headstones
and, uh, burial insurance
straight to their own people.
And for every product they sold,
- they could keep the commission.
- WILLIE: Hmm.
Wait a minute now, so the Loewen Group
was taking poor Black people,
having them sell their funeral products
to other poor Black people
for a commission.
Course, they said it was all win-win.
Help people out of poverty,
boost economic empowerment.
But it never did much for anybody.
Except the Loewen Group, of course.
Yeah.
MATTIE:
They was just trying to find another way
to exploit Black folks
in their most vulnerable moments.
♪ ♪
You know what this right here is?
Not sure.
What it is, is a cemetery.
Now, you can't tell from looking at it
on account of the fact that
there's no headstones.
Why's that?
RUBEN: That's 'cause
it's a different kind of cemetery.
It's an old slave burial ground.
Everybody knows slaves didn't have
no money of their own
to ever bury their loved ones
with a headstone.
Though you can't really tell
by looking at it...
...our entire history,
history of Black people in the South,
history of Black people in America...
(sighs)
...of our slave ancestors, it's,
it's all buried everywhere out here.
Deep underground.
Pretty much everywhere you look,
that's where our history is.
In these vast, empty fields.
In some places,
they put up all these statues.
You know,
like all these Confederate monuments
and statues you see everywhere.
All the lot of 'em is put up right on top
of a slave burial field.
Mm-hmm.
It's like taking one history
and putting it right on top of another.
It's like taking one man's legacy,
putting it on top of another.
Till, one day, it gets pushed down so deep
buried so deep...
...can't no one ever find it no more.
WOMAN:
Some of the members came to me
and told me that
the actual cost of burying my father
was gonna be much more than
what they said when I bought the policy.
When I told them
that I didn't have the extra money,
and I didn't know how long
it would take me to get it,
they happily said
they'd keep the body on ice.
Rather than give me any comfort,
the deacon assigned to be counselor
used it as an opportunity to shove
a bunch of brochures in my face
and try and recruit me
as a Loewen sales rep.
Then, suddenly,
this man from the NBC shows up,
asking if I've made
funeral arrangements and...
if I'd be interested
in a Loewen burial package.
He said I'd get a much better deal
if I paid upfront.
Before my son died.
Once my husband finally passed,
that's when they said
that the package that I bought
didn't cover the cost of embalming
or moving the body.
The coffin I bought for my mom
was the least expensive one.
Come to find out
the one they sold me was
three times more than average.
Your own preacher come to you,
telling you you need something,
and you religious, you believe it.
WILLIE:
Now, I understand that you are
one of the analysts for the Loewen Group.
You deal with
some of the high-level deals.
Is that correct?
- Yes, that's correct.

Also that you were, uh,
one of the architects of this latest deal
that you had between the Loewen Group

Yeah, yeah, yeah. You Baptist?
- No, not Baptist.
- No.
- Christian, though, right?

Yeah, yeah. We all Christian, right?
We all believe in God. Amen?
Amen.
(Willie exhales)
Here's the question, though.
How much money did the Loewen Group
project to make from this deal
of them and the NBC?
And remember...
you're under oath.
Uh, our original long-term projections
for that deal were somewhere around
1... maybe $1.2 billion.
$1.2 million?
- $1.2 billion.
- $1.2...
$1.2 billion?
$1.2 billion, that's-that's good money.
That's good money
for the Loewen Group, correct?
- Yes.
- That's good money.
That's good money. $1.2 billion.
I thought you said "million,"
but you said "billion dollars."
Uh...
How much did you pay 'em?
I'm sorry?
I said, how much did you pay 'em?
How much did the Loewen Group
pay the National Baptist Convention
as compensation as a result of the deal?
I believe we made
about a $200,000 donation.

We didn't have a defense for it.

And, uh,
I'll just start right off with it.
I want to know, from your perspective...
(clears throat)
...what was the deal that you had
between you and Mr. O'Keefe?
I believe it was roughly a year ago
when we received an enquiry
from a representative of Mr. O'Keefe's.
In fact,
I'm pretty sure it was his lawyer,
Mr. Allred, who contacted us.
My understanding is
they were very anxious to sell.
So we started looking into the deal.
Sussing it out.
Trying to determine if it was something
that would be a good fit for our business.
Sometime after that,
I invited Mr. O'Keefe and his associates
up to Vancouver.
If I recall, they came for dinner,
at my boat, and we discussed things.
After that, uh, hard to say.
Normally, at that stage, I turn things
over to my acquisitions team.
Well, that's pleasant.
I mean, that really is.
And... (clears throat)
...lucky for you,
uh, Mr. Loewen, I don't have
a lot of follow-up questions.
I just have, uh, one thing
I want to ask you. Uh...
What kind of boat?
Come again?
Oh, I said: "What kind of boat?"
You-you said earlier that you guys
were all on the boat together,
and y'all was eating
and having a good time,
having the best fish,
and I just wanted to know,
what kind of boat is it?
I don't understand.
Are you asking
about the particular make, or...
Matter of fact, I was asking...
Can I read from this?
It says, "Nine sunning decks."
Mm. "Six elegant staterooms."
- Uh...
- Objection, Your Honor.
- What is the relevance...
- "Five luxury guest cabins."
- ...of the witnesses' boat?
- Overruled.
Your Honor,
can I just read what the boat is?
- Overruled, Ms. Downes.
- It's a nice boat.

You can land a helicopter

Oh. You know what?

I want to ask you again:
how much did you pay

Mr. Loewen.
How much did your boat cost?
What is your point?
What's my point?
What is my point?
While you were sitting there sunning
on that $25 million boat,
eating your $30 a head lobster,
did it ever bother you
that it was all being paid for
by all the poor people
and destitute people

systematically taking advantage of

- MAME: Objection! Counsel is testifying.
- Huh? Not only that,
they were taking advantage of 'em
at their worst time,
when they're downtrodden,
when they lost somebody,
when they're mourning somebody.
And now, who has to pay for it?
The small businessman
like Jeremiah O'Keefe.
The small businessman in this country,
who worked so hard to pay for everything
and stay on top and keep afloat
while these greedy corporations
do everything they can and...

What you do, you, uh...
come down here for your last licking?
- Oh, my last licking?
- (chuckles)
(chuckling):
No.
I actually just wanted
to congratulate you.
Really?
- Yeah.
- Congratulate me?
Mm-hmm.
Now come on. You mean that?
(scoffs) Listen, I hate losing.
But it was a well-earned victory.
I can be honest about that.
Well, I venture, but that's $500 million.
Now, somewhere inside,
I know you think that's way too much.
Yeah, maybe there's a part of me
that thinks it's not enough.
- Well, I can take more.
- (chuckles)
Good luck to you, Willie Gary.
Ah. Keep in touch.
Hope to see you on the trail.
Well...
Hey, Mame?
I gotta tell you something.
You one of the toughest lawyers
I've ever had to go against.
You, too.
No doubt Johnnie would be impressed.

- Willie Gary. I can't believe it.
- Yeah.
- How you doing, man?
- Nice to see you, Dr. G. How you feeling?
I want to be just like you when I grow up.
You know what?
You're gonna be better than me.
- Get out of here. Take care now.
