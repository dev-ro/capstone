J remember...
my stepfather
wouJd beat me with extension cords
and hangers,
pieces of wood
and aJJ kinds of stuff.
He wouJd teJJ me:
"Jt hurt me more than you.
"J onJy did it, because J Jove you."
Jt communicated the wrong message
to me about what Jove was.
So, for many years,
J thought
that Jove was supposed to hurt.
J hurt everyone that J Joved.
And J measured Jove
by how much pain
someone wouJd take from me.
And it wasn t untiJ J came to ison,
[ pr
an environment
that is devoid of Jove,
that J began to have
some understanding
about what it actuaJJy
was and was not.
J met someone.
She gave me my first reaJ insight
into what Jove was.
She saw past my condition
and the fact that J was in prison
with a Jife sentence
for doing the worst kind of murder
that a man can do:
murdering a woman and a chiJd.
Jt was Agnes,
the mother and grandmother of...
Patricia and Chris, that J murdered,
who gave me
my best Jesson about Jove.
By aJJ rights, she shouJd hate me.
[
But she didn t.
Over the course of time,
through the journey that we took,
it has been pretty amazing,
she gave me Jove.
She taught me what it was.
J m ve happ when it ains,
[ ry y r
when J drink miJk
and J have a good Jife.
When J put on weight.
[
J m thin now.
When it rains,
J am very happy.
When J drink miJk
and J eat everything J Jike.
And when J sJeep with the man J Jove
who says sweet things to me.
And when J am in a nice hut
that protects me
from the coJd and rain.
Those are the things
that make me happy.
Happiness, for us,
wouJd be...
having food,
a smaJJ piece of Jand
and a reaJ pJace to Jive,
with eJectricity day and night.
We wouJdn t have to sJee
[ p
in the dark.
That wouJd be happiness.
But we sJeep on the fJoor,
without even a mat, on straw.
With eJectricity,
there wouJd be Jight
in m chiJd en s Jives.
y r [
So,
as J had
a difficuJt chiJdhood
without any money,
when J went to university,
J got a grant
and J bought myseJf a motorbike.
Brand-new!
J was the first person
to start it up.
J was the first person to get on it
to go home.
When J feeJ the wind
whipping me as J ride aJong,
[
knowing that J m not
[ r
on someone eJses moto bike.
Jts m ve own moto bike.
[ y ry r
J arrived home,
and to get to sJeep,
J put the bike in my bedroom
and J Jocked myseJf in with it.
That way, J couJd smeJJ
the hot engine.
The smeJJ of the engine,
the new bike smeJJ.
And when J turned the Jight on,
J couJd see it was my very own bike.
J couJdn t ut the bike
[ p
on the bed, under the covers,
[
but its what J wanted to do.
Yes...
J feJt it. Yes.
That was a moment
of great happiness for me.
Happiness
is the chiJdren coming home.
Thats a mothe s ha iness.
[ r[ pp
Jts when m husband
[ y
comes home, smiJes,
and kisses me,
after 33 years of married Jife.
Thats a woman s ha iness.
[ [ pp
Happiness is hearing
my grandchiJdren saying: "Grandma!"
When they say that, you feeJ oJder,
but thats ha iness, too.
[ pp
[
Jts aJso meeting coJJeagues
who are happy to see you.
They think:
" [ r [ "
Shes he e, Jets taJk.
Thats ha iness, too.
[ pp
[ r
Jts getting up in the mo ning
and not hurting anywhere.
Thats ha iness, too.
[ pp
Jts the ain which is the omise
[ r pr
of a good harvest.
There are many kinds of happiness,
but at the same time,
the es onJ one:
r [ y
ou e aJive, so ou e happ.
y [r y [r y
Just my experiences
from being in a wheeJchair
and traveJing the worJd
in a wheeJchair
[ r r
Jve seen Jife f om a diffe ent angJe
[
and thats taught me
on a spirituaJ JeveJ
to just accept and to be happy,
r[
whateve s coming next.
J m so mentaJJ st ong.
[ y r
The onJy reason is because
of Josing my Jegs physicaJJy.
M e esights sha pe, m ea s a e...
y y [ r r y r r
J can hear much better.
So, thats on a h sicaJ sense, but
[ p y
J feeJ Jm Juck, as in
[ y
J don t anaJ e
[ yz
or question Jife too much.
J can cruise through Jife
and aJways be
in the right pJace at the right time.
J aJways have amazing things
happen to me.
J m eaJJ Juck in that situation.
[ r y y
But that comes from beJieving in Juck
or beJieving
in the power of attraction
or beJieving in
attracting the goodness
[
into ones Jife.
And J think
that can be seen as Juck.
So, if God HimseJf
jumped down in front of me right now
and said to me:
B uno, J JJ give ou back ou Jegs,
" r [ y y r
but J JJ take awa aJJ that
" [ y
ou ve Jea ned in the Jast 13 ea s.
y [ r y r "
J JJ teJJ God: Kee ou Jegs.
[ " p y r "
We didn t use to die Jike toda.
[ y
We Jived in peace.
r [
Ou fighting didn t kiJJ us.
There was onJy one gun per viJJage.
What decimates us is the KaJashnikov.
Before, we onJy died
from sickness and disease.
A few peopJe died:
a sick person, an oJd man, a baby.
OnJy the weak.
The victims of the KaJashnikov
are countJess.
Our fighting is degenerating.
3 men die from one shot.
Yesterday, peopJe died.
We didn t bu them.
[ ry
Maybe animaJs ate them.
That weapon is bad.
Jt deprives the young generation
and the country
of peace.
As soon as J took up arms,
J feJt fear.
Fear is a human feeJing.
J was afraid of bJood.
When J took up arms,
J went from being a teacher
to a man of arms.
J had no choice.
J saw and experienced things
which forced me to do it.
Sometimes my son asks me,
because it worries him:
"Dad, why this war?
Js there no end to it?
"Why do you kiJJ the soJdier?
Doesn t the soJdie have a famiJ
" [ r y
"waiting for him, just Jike us?"
J say to him:
"H [ r [r r "
es w ong and we e ight.
"Why, Dad?"
J say:
"He kiJJs famiJies and chiJdren.
"He destroys mosques.
"We defend aJJ that."
We aJways try to be cJear
to the chiJdren.
We teJJ them that we took up arms,
because we had to,
not because we wanted to.
[
J don t Jike having bJood
on my hands...
or the idea that J kiJJed someone.
Nobody Jikes that.
J m not af aid of death.
[ r
J m not af aid if its fo S ia.
[ r [ r yr
J m not af aid if its fo m fathe.
[ r [ r y r
[
Jf he wasn t dead,
J wouJd be afraid of death.
[ r r
But J m no Jonge af aid.
Even if my throat is cut
or J get bJown up.
What matters is joining my father
or going back to Syria.
During the genocide...
J was separated from my parents
and J Jived aJone
in the sorghum fieJds.
J spent at Jeast two weeks there.
Then,
someone took me.
She asked me who J was.
But as J was very JittJe,
[
J couJdn t distinguish
between Hutus and Tutsis.
J didn t eaJJ know.
[ r y
She Jooked at me and started touching
my fingers, my skin.
She toJd me J was a Tutsi
or mixed race.
She toJd peopJe to shoot me,
to eJiminate me.
J asked why,
[ r
what Jd done w ong.
After that,
there was a Jot of shooting.
J ran away.
AJJ aJong the way,
there were corpses and bJood.
Then J sat down and asked God
that His wiJJ be done.
J was Jucky to survive.
J went home.
The door was smashed in.
Jn front, there was a hoJe
where a sheJJ had faJJen.
J went in
and found my father Jying there.
J saw my brothers too, behind him.
My father
had opened the door to them.
He toJd them
there were no combatants.
They toJd him to step forward.
My mother and brothers were Jined up.
"Join them."
As soon as he moved,
they started shooting.
He got a buJJet in the back.
He feJJ.
They started shooting at my brothers.
At the time of the massacre,
in 1982, J was a young student.
J didn t hate an one,
[ y
J feJt no hatred.
But that massacre
made me question many things.
J asked myseJf:
"Who Joves me? Who hates me?
"Why did this happen?"
J thought more about it
and aJJ that brought about in me
a Jove of hatred,
a Jove of vengeance.
[ r
Man isn t bo n with those feeJings.
They grow
over the course of your experiences.
Both Jove and hatred.
WouJd you forgive me
if J kiJJ your father or brother?
Jf no Jaw stands in my way?
Jf your rights are scorned?
WouJd you forgive me
if Jd kiJJed ou b othe,
[ y r r r
father or mother?
No, certainJy not.
No way.
J wiJJ never forgive.
Even if my head is cut off.
One evening, whiJe in the reserves,
my unit had to stop a suicide attack
by capturing a terrorist
in a viJJage near NabJus.
J depJoyed our forces.
To fJush him out,
we shot at the waJJs
as a demonstration of strength.
A woman came out of the house,
carrying a girJ
and hoJding another by the hand.
Jt was 3 AM.
The girJ panicked and ran toward us.
J was af aid she d bJow he seJf u.
r [ r p
J yeJJed at her in Arabic to stop.
She kept coming.
J fired above her head.
She stopped.
At that moment, time stood stiJJ.
Jt was the shortest
and the Jongest moment
of my Jife.
The girJ remained aJive.
And so did J.
But at the same time,
something died
in us both.
When a chiJd is shot at,
it kiJJs something inside.
[
J don t know what.
When an aduJt shoots at a chiJd,
it kiJJs something inside.
Something dies
and something eJse
has to come to Jife.
J was ashamed of shooting at her.
A painfuJ shame.
And above aJJ, this sensation
of my finger
pressing the trigger
and shooting at the girJ.
From this finger pressing the trigger
something had to come to Jife.
One of the most impactfuJ things
that wiJJ occur,
after being in combat,
is the feeJing
of kiJJing another human being.
Once ou ve ex e ienced it,
y [ p r
ou JJ see
y [
that its not Jike an thing eJse
[ y
that ou ve ex e ienced befo e.
y [ p r r
And unfortunateJy,
that feeJing,
your body wiJJ want
to experience again.
Jts eaJJ difficuJt
[ r y
to try to expJain to somebody
[
what that feeJing s Jike.
Right now,
J stiJJ feeJ Jike experiencing
that again,
and its obabJ wh J kee
[ pr y y p
a Joaded weapon in my house.
J yearn or desire for someone
to try to hurt me
or to break in
or to give me an excuse
to use that vioJence
against somebody eJse again.
On the 16th of January 2007,
an JsraeJi border poJiceman
shot and kiJJed
my 10-year-oJd daughter, Abir,
in front of her schooJ
in Anath where J Jive.
She was with her sister
and two friends.
9.30 in the morning.
Jn her head in the back
from a distance of 15 to 20 meters
by a rubber buJJet.
r [ r
Abi wasn t a fighte.
She was just
a chiJd.
She didn t know an thing
[ y
about the confJict
and she was not part
of this confJict.
UnfortunateJy, she Jost her Jife
because she was a PaJestinian.
[ r r
J m an Js aeJi who Jost his daughte
to a suicide bombing
on the 4th of September 1997.
And J am a product of...
of an education system.
These are two societies at war.
They sociaJize the young generation
to make them abJe to sacrifice
themseJves when the time comes.
This is true to PaJestinian society
and this is aJso true
to JsraeJi society.
Because we are human beings.
Sometimes you think:
"Jf J kiJJ the kiJJer
"or anyone from the other side,
from the JsraeJis,
"or maybe ten,
"this wiJJ give me back my daughter."
No.
J JJ cause anothe ain
[ r p
and another victim to the others.
J decided
to break this circJe of vioJence
and bJood and revenge
by stopping kiJJing
and supporting revenge,
by myseJf.
My definition of "sides"
has changed dramaticaJJy.
Today, on my side are
aJJ those who want peace and are
wiJJing to pay the price of peace.
On the other side
are those who do not want peace
and are not wiJJing
to pay the price of peace.
Many peopJe toJd me:
Jts not ou ight
" [ y r r
to forgive in her name."
And the answer:
its aJso not m ight
[ y r
to seek revenge in her name.
J ho e shes satisfied.
p [
J hope she rests in peace.
e es what ha ened:
H r [ pp
a German officer
in an SS uniform
entered the ghetto
one rainy night.
My mother toJd him:
"Take my daughter."
She Jifted the wire fence
and handed him her baby, me,
a Jewish girJ
2 and a haJf years oJd.
And with a heavy heart,
she put me in the hands
of a wonderfuJ man
in an SS uniform.
J now know that this man,
AJoïs PJeva,
served in the German army
and Jived near the German border.
This man put me in his coat.
He hid me inside his coat
and took me
to the border
between Germany and PoJand
to his parents.
They passed me off as his daughter.
They raised me
in the purest CathoJic tradition
untiJ the end of the war.
What a gesture!
What magic,
this outstretched hand!
Like sparks of Jight
in what we caJJ human foJJy.
Sometimes a question comes to mind.
Jf J had been
in a situation Jike that,
wouJd J have acted in the same way
as that German officer?
How can J answer
such a question?
[
J don t think J wouJd have had
the moraJ strength to do it,
in aJJ honesty.
Maybe.
Did he know he had the strength?
How can you know?
How can you recognize
the moment of truth
when you can sacrifice yourseJf,
sacrifice the onJy Jife you have
for someone eJse?
r [ r
The es no answe to that question.
Or a question
others can answer.
But this question must be asked.
Love is the beginning and the end.
Love is where we come from,
r [r
whe e we e going
and what we Jive between the two.
Love is everything.
Love.
The word Jove
is fuJJ of meaning for me.
When you taJk about Jove,
it encompasses everything.
Love encompasses everything,
[
doesn t it?
Whe e the es no Jove, ou feeJ em t
r r [ y p y
or rather, J feeJ empty.
Love...
Love is what fiJJs the souJ.
You have to take Jove
one day at a time.
You Jive it every day.
Love is this feeJing that you can
give
and that the other person gives you.
My wife has a strong character.
Shes the one who guides the famiJ.
[ y
J Jove her a Jot.
[
Shes magnificent.
Jf ou don t make Jove,
y [
your Jove wiJJ be a faiJure.
Do you hear? Why?
Through Jove comes sex.
Without sex, ou JJ go w ong.
y [ r
Your wife wiJJ ask herseJf:
"He gives me Jove, but not sex.
"Love, food, cJothing, everything,
"but not sex.
"What can J do with this man?"
What wiJJ happen to our home?
The home wiJJ coJJapse,
because after Jove must come sex.
And thats uJtimateJ
[ y
why Jove exists.
r r [
Othe wise, the es nothing.
Oh, wow!
What a question to ask me...
Jf Jve had Jove s?
[ r
To be honest, Jve neve had an.
[ r y
[
J haven t...
J went to parties,
[
but J didn t go to dances, because,
to teJJ you the truth,
J never Jearned to dance.
r [ r
J t ied, but it didn t wo k.
So, J gave up.
When you marry someone,
you marry them as they are.
At a given moment,
you Jove them the way they are.
J had an accident.
J Jost my arms and Jegs.
She didn t ma a gu
[ rry y
with no arms or Jegs.
But she stood it
for a number of years.
We ended up separating,
we got a divorce.
J had to start a new Jife.
Jt took me 3 years
to get over the break-up.
After 3 years, J said to myseJf:
ou can t sta on ou own!
"Y [ y y r "
So, J signed up on the internet
to a dating site.
At first, J just put a head shot.
The rest was a surprise.
[ r r
J didn t show J had no a ms o Jegs.
J had fun on the net,
but when J toJd peopJe
about my handicap,
nobody answered me.
So, J announced my handicap
and one day, J met Suzanna.
There we are, Jove is possibJe.
Weve been togethe fo 8 ea s.
[ r r y r
Suzanna has 3 girJs, J have 2 boys.
We have a one-eyed dog,
4 cats, a guinea-pig.
Jts one big econstituted famiJ.
[ r y
An thing s ossibJe.
y [ p
J found Jove again.
And we reaJJy Jove each other.
Jve been ma ied to m husband
[ rr y
for 18 years now.
He has never said, "J Jove you,"
but J feeJ he does.
Sometimes,
eyes speak more than mouths.
When J was younger, J wondered
how peopJe couJd Jive together
for so Jong,
without faJJing out of Jove.
J aJso couJdn t imagine how eo Je
[ p p
couJd sJeep
in the same bed for 20 years.
J thought it wouJd be boring.
[
But its not!
Every day,
J think,
"Yesterday, my Jove was weaker.
Toda, its t ue Jove.
" y [ r "
And then, a year goes by.
This Jove becomes even stronger.
When J go to bed at night,
J Jook at him and think,
if he died,
J couJd never repJace him.
After being married for...
50 years, 49...
51 years.
My wife took seriousJy iJJ
just before we ceJebrated
our 50th wedding anniversary.
And she suffered terribJy
for about 2 years
as an invaJid.
For the Jast 2 years of her Jife,
J was her nurse,
J was her doctor, J was her friend,
J was her Jover, J was her husband.
Everybody wanted me to get
a fuJJ-time nurse, day and night,
and she begged me not to.
She onJy wanted me to Jook after her.
And J Joved doing it for her.
And J did it by myseJf.
J carried her to the car,
J carried her oxygen tank,
her wheeJchair.
J packed it in the car,
J pushed her round,
J put it back, J took her home,
J bathed her, J put her to bed.
And J Joved it
that J was abJe to do it for her
without anyone eJse.
And she appreciated it.
[
Thats Jove.
The magic moment
that J had with my grandfather
was right after my grandmother died.
J went to go see him.
J knew that he was hurting,
[ r
but J wasn t su e
what kind of state he wouJd be in.
And she was his partner 65 years
as weJJ as his driver.
J said: "Grandpa...
"How are you doing?"
And he said:
"Did you know that for 4 doJJars,
"J can get a shuttJe
anywhere in the city?"
J said:
Wow, thats g eat, G and a.
" [ r r p "
He said:
"WeJJ, J went to the grocery store,
"J went to the woman
behind the counter and said:
"J have this Jist of things.
CouJd you heJp me find them?
"My wife has recentJy changed
her residence to heaven."
And J said:
"Grandpa, man, you aJways
heJp me see the gJass as haJf fuJJ."
And he Jeaned back,
Jooked me in the eyes, and he said:
" [ "
Jts a beautifuJ gJass.
When J was 12, J Jeft
m g andpa ents house
y r r [
because of abuse.
J went to Jive in the street.
Jt was better for me to keep going
and try to become independent.
What J can never forgive
concerns my mother.
[
SeJJing me wasn t a good idea.
[r r r
Because we e he chiJd en
and she suffered, giving birth to us.
[ [ r r
So, thats what J JJ neve fo give.
The hardest moment
in my whoJe Jife
was m fathe s death.
y r[
Because...
J don t want to c.
[ ry
He supported me.
He wouJd...
He wouJd encourage
me and my brothers.
J m not af aid of an thing an mo e,
[ r y y r
[ r
because Jve been th ough
many horribJe things,
[ r
and Jve g own used to it.
And Jm ha dJ sca ed of an thing.
[ r y r y
When they say to me:
We e going to hit ou.
" [r y
We JJ kiJJ ou.
[ y "
J sa to them: No, J m not sca ed,
y " [ r
"and if you do,
[ r "
J won t be sca ed.
My father used to teJJ me
that it didn t matte if ou feJJ.
[ r y
You just had to get up again.
Jf J feJJ, J had to get up again.
AJways get up again.
That heJps me a Jot.
Jf J Jived in the past,
Jd s end m time c ing,
[ p y ry
[ r
Jd be bitte,
J wouJdn t be f iendJ.
[ r y
You have to know
how to pJay and smiJe,
because Jiving in the past is no use.
You have to Jive in the present.
FamiJy, to me,
is a communion.
[
Jts coming home
and being greeted:
Jts good to have ou home!
" [ y "
HeJping my brothers
to do what J can aJready do,
because Jm one of the eJde s.
[ r
Teaching them.
Seeing my father
come home from work, satisfied,
sitting in his armchair,
and me making him a coffee.
That makes me feeJ good.
Jt fiJJs you up inside.
[
Jf someones missing,
it feeJs Jike a hoJe in your heart.
"What the heJJ has happened?
"Where is he?"
FamiJy is something
happy, remarkabJe.
[
Jts something eJse.
Jt fiJJs you up.
When J was young,
J didn t think J was going to sta
[ y
in the reJigious community
that J had joined.
And J su ose J didn t unde stand
pp [ r
what J was actuaJJy doing
and that J was maybe
making a decision
which meant
[ r
that J wouJdn t have chiJd en
and J wouJdn t have a famiJ
[ y
as other peopJe had.
J don t eaJJ think
[ r y
J understood that,
but Jater in Jife,
J had a sister who died
of cancer.
And when J saw her famiJy,
J reaJized
that when J died,
the e wouJdn t be an bod...
r [ y y
to mourn me the same way.
As time goes on, then you recognize
that you are a parent to other peopJe
who you work with
or who are friends
or who are reJated
to you in some way.
So, even though
ou haven t ou own famiJ,
y [ y r y
you have famiJy.
So, J think thats im o tant to me.
[ p r
My whoJe Jife,
J wanted to have a son.
J aJready had daughters.
J wanted a son
to support me, be my right-hand man.
My son brings me a Jot,
just in the way he Jooks at me.
When we[re doing odd jobs
...
J try to expJain things to him.
J often say to him:
it is said...
that when God...
gave
this chiJd to that famiJy,
the angeJs asked: "Lord,
"why do You give a handicapped chiJd
to that famiJy?
The Jive weJJ. The e ha.
" y y[r ppy
"Why do You impose
such a burden on them?"
God repJied:
"J chose them
"so that they may teach the chiJd
that J exist,
"that J am omnipresent,
"in the Jeaves and in the wind."
Thats what J teJJ m son.
[ y
J say to him...
J teJJ him aJJ the time...
J say to him: "Look, AJyosha.
" [
Thats a Jeaf.
"And those are fJowers.
"AJJ that makes up
"the happiness of Jife."
When J m with AJ ocha in the evening,
[ y
J say to him:
"Look, son,
those are stars!"
And he
sees them
and he Jooks at me
with aduJt eyes.
J get the impression
that he has a spirit
[ r r
thats much st onge than mine.
Jts m son who guides me.
[ y
He guides the whoJe famiJy.
Thats wh...
[ y
now J understand
what Jove is
and the meaning of Jove.
Because to Jive together,
you must Jove yourseJf,
Jove your wife,
your chiJdren,
big and smaJJ.
You must Jove your famiJy,
your parents.
My parents are stiJJ aJive.
You must Jove
aJJ human beings
for what they are deep down
for onJy the Jove of peopJe
can save the worJd.
No, J never thought about it.
[
J wouJdn t have Jiked to be a man.
Because men have an easy Jife.
Too easy.
And easy Jives are boring.
Jts eas ofessionaJJ,
[ y pr y
maybe even easier to attain
their sentimentaJ prey.
For women,
everything is more difficuJt.
But there is aJso the appeaJ
of attaining your goaJs
despite the difficuJties.
Without question, J prefer
being a woman.
J feeJ powerJess when, say,
a very smaJJ woman enters the store,
sees something high up
and says to me:
"Jf onJy a man couJd get that..."
Y [
ou don t have to be a man.
Jump up and grab it.
You have two hands. Why a man?
Whatever next?
Jt makes me so angry.
J eaJJ don t Jike it when women...
r y [
J hate it
when women are discriminated against.
Today, J feeJ free.
Because...
J can do Jots of things
without rushing.
[ r
Whats mo e,
[ r
J m divo ced.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
J shouJdn t sa that, shouJd J?
[ y
Sorry.
Do you want to do it again?
Js that OK?
[
J know J shouJdn t Jaugh about it,
but J feeJ good, J feeJ free.
My husband has 2 wives.
H [ p y
es oJ gamous, he has 2 wives.
Here, in SenegaJ,
with poJygamy,
some peopJe have 4 wives.
Others have 3, or 2.
But some peopJe onJy have 1 wife.
[ r
Jts thei choice.
Some even have 6, 7, 8, 9...
as many as 10!
But my husband has 2 wives.
2 wives.
[ r
J m the 1st, the othe is the 2nd.
We Jive in peace.
Shes m f iend.
[ y r
She reaJJy Joves me. And J Jove her.
LuckiJy, for us,
oJ gam isn t ossibJe fo women.
p y y [ p r
J say "JuckiJy," because if my wife
Joved another man besides me,
[
itd make things difficuJt.
Jt d be ve com Jicated
[ ry p
because J am extremeJy jeaJous.
ExtremeJy jeaJous.
[
J couJdn t stand
my wife spending the night
r [ r
in anothe man s a ms
and then spend the next night
with me.
J couJd never stand that.
So, JuckiJy,
poJygamy for women
isn t ossibJe in Bu kina Faso.
[ p r
Because J just couJdn[t imagine it
.
When J went and stayed with my...
wife at her house in San Francisco...
Shes not m wife,
[ y
[
but the woman Jm with.
This was about a week
after we started dating.
J woke up in the morning and J said:
"J ask this of you
and this of you and this of you
and ou e hesitating.
" y [r "
[
The woman Jm with
[
can t have a Jist of nos.
Jts got to be ett much aJJ eses
[ pr y y
o we don t have a eJationshi.
r [ r p
And it took her about a month
after J pointed that out to her
to reaJize
that these nos couJd not exist.
And so, thats how ve JittJe shitt
[ ry y
my woman is.
Shes f eakin ve uni ue,
[ r [ ry q
very amazing.
She gives me...
Like, she was raised
to adore her man.
Like oJd-schooJ Mexican.
Know when to speak up.
[
That doesn t mean
ou can t teJJ me something,
y [
[
that doesn t mean
[
J don t want guidance.
But in my househoJd,
the man is the man of the house.
At home, on weekends,
J do the cooking.
One day, a friend came to my house.
He said: "You do the cooking?"
J said: "Yes."
"Js your wife sick?"
" [ r "
J said: No, shes esting.
"What? You do the cooking
"whiJe your wife has a rest?"
"Yes, she needs rest."
He said:
"My wife wiJJ never come visit you.
ou d ut ideas in he head.
"Y [ p r
"When she comes home,
" [ "
she JJ ask me to cook too.
J said to him: "You must understand
"that they need to rest."
Anyway, J enjoy
cooking for my famiJy.
J m in ison,
[ pr
because J had an abortion.
J couJdn t have continued m studies
[ y
because J was in a boarding schooJ
and J didn t want to sto m studies.
[ p y
Jd have sto ed fo too Jong,
[ pp r
with the pregnancy,
the birth, breastfeeding,
[ r
and J couJdn t conside that.
So, J decided to have an abortion.
What pJeases me today
is that Jm getting out of ison
[ pr
tomorrow.
J JJ continue m studies
[ y
and work.
And ma be one da, J JJ have a chiJd.
y y [
J[JJ be just Jike everyone eJse
.
There is a way out of being abused.
For me, it was tough because
J used to have the worst abuse.
J wouJd have a gun put to my head
and get toJd to go on my knees
and beg for my Jife.
And J wouJd do it.
My kids used to be watching.
Or get put out of the house
and have to sJeep outside
on the steps.
Jf J moved from there,
[
Jd get a hiding.
Jt was tough,
because J thought it was me.
J was the one
that was doing something wrong
in our marriage.
J taJked about my kids,
the most important thing of my Jife.
J thought,
[ r
if J don t move on out of he e,
[ r
J m eithe going to be dead
or my kids are going to be dead.
So, J need to move on.
J need to do something.
J went home that day
" [ "
and J said to him: J m Jeaving.
Mark got a bit of a shock,
[ r z
because he didn t eaJi e
that J was Jeaving.
H "Y [ r
e said: ou JJ neve Jeave me,
you Jove me too much."
And J said: "WeJJ, you know what?
" [ "
Thats what Jove is about. Leaving.
J gave him two choices.
J said to him:
"You either go for counseJing,
or J Jeave."
You know what?
Toda, hes a bette man.
y [ r
es neve Jifted a hand u fo me
H [ r p r
since the day.
Thats about 9 ea s ago.
[ y r
So, 9 years ago,
J was stiJJ an abused woman.
J am gay.
[ [ r
Jve known Jve Jiked gi Js
ever since J was a JittJe girJ.
And J kept it a secret
from my famiJy.
J remember when EJJen DeGeneres,
the TV host, came out,
it was the first time J ever heard
of the word "gay" before.
My parents were taJking about it.
J asked my dad: "Dad, what is gay?"
" [ r r r
Jts a gi J who Jikes anothe gi J
and the e going to heJJ.
y[r "
And so, J said: "OK."
J waJked straight up to my room,
cJosed the door
very quietJy,
and then,
J bawJed my eyes out into my piJJow.
And J prayed to God every day:
"PJease Jet me Jike boys,
pJease make me straight."
Because J knew J Jiked girJs.
And so, J tried
pretending J Jiked boys,
but J never did.
And then, J met
to me the Jove of my Jife.
And her name is Jen.
Gosh, she was just...
my worJd changed.
And J didn t eaJJ ca e
[ r y r
about anything eJse.
J just knew J wanted to be near her.
And that was Jove to me.
Being a Jesbian
is not a choice for me.
Jts something that is inside ou...
[ y
that noone can heJp.
[ r
Jts not cu abJe.
Jts not a disease actuaJJ.
[ y
Cause the aJwa s sa we e sick.
[ y y y [r
Our famiJies
r[
even take us to the docto s,
r [
to the ma abouts.
But it just stays there.
J even had to
force myseJf with guys
to get m g ann s app ovaJ.
y r y[ r
r [
Jt hu ts, cause
J had to do stuff
J eaJJ, eaJJ didn t want to do.
r y r y [
Even though J did that...
J even asked a friend of mine
to etend as if hes m bo f iend.
pr [ y y r
But that guy, what he did...
He forced himseJf to me
and then, he Jeft me with HJV.
And that was in 2003.
J did aJJ that
just to get my granny[s approvaJ
.
But now
J know
that J don t have to do an thing
[ y
to pJease someone eJse.
My parents were so afraid
[ r
Jd emain a homosexuaJ
that when J said J was changing,
they reaJJy beJieved it.
They asked me every day:
"OK, have you changed?"
As its not ossibJe to change,
[ p
J pretended to ignore the question.
After a whiJe,
m fathe couJdn t take an mo e.
y r [ y r
He started yeJJing at me,
hitting me and saying:
J know ou haven t changed!
" y [
"Jf you buJJshit me,
J JJ make ou Jife heJJ.
"[ y r
"Leave now
if ou e eaJJ Jike that.
y [r r y "
[
So, J Jeft. J didn t hesitate.
J Jeft.
J have a son who s now 31 ea s oJd
[ y r
who J Jove very much.
H [ y y
es ga, a ga man.
The day that he came out
was quite significant.
J knew that he was struggJing
with something.
H [
e d been suicidaJ
and he was 18 years oJd.
He said to me one day:
Dad, Jve got to teJJ ou something.
" [ y "
And J said:
"OK, son, teJJ me, what is it?"
He went paJe, he reaJJy went white,
and he said: "J feeJ sick."
And my heart reaJJy went out to him.
At that moment, J kind of knew
that he was going to teJJ me
he was gay
[
aJthough J hadn t made
that connection,
because he s uite mascuJine
[ q
in his traits.
At that moment, J had a sense
[
thats what he was going to teJJ me.
So, J said to him:
"Son, Jet me guess.
"Let me make it easier for you."
He said OK.
"Y [r
J said: ou e going to teJJ me
ou e ga, a en t ou?
y [r y r [ y "
He went: "Yes, J am."
J just reaJJy, reaJJy feJt for him.
Jt was such a struggJe for him
to teJJ me that.
Everything sort of made sense,
because he didn t want to be ga.
[ y
And thats wh he d been suicidaJ.
[ y [
J just gave him a big hug
and said: "J Jove you anyway, son.
Jt doesn t make an diffe ence
" [ y r
to how much J Jove you."
And J think that
our reJationship has reaJJy been
a Jot stronger since then.
[
So, thats been
a journey in itseJf.
Jt was in 2009.
A friend, homosexuaJ Jike me.
When this friend died,
he was buried
in his viJJage cemetery.
But the JocaJ imam
gathered together the peopJe,
the young peopJe.
They went to the cemetery
to dig up the body.
They took it, tied it up,
and dragged it through the streets.
The media were there.
They fiJmed it.
The poJice came.
Afterwards,
the famiJy got the body back
and buried it again.
Jt was dug up again. 3 times in aJJ.
Jn the end, the body was buried
in his fathe s a d.
r[ y r
Because the MusJim reJigion says
that when ou e homosexuaJ,
y [r
if you die,
peopJe can t p a fo ou,
[ r y r y
the can t bu ou
y [ ry y
in a MusJim cemetery.
Thats what the sa.
[ y y
J m a ga man f om Lebanon.
[ y r
We have no rights over there.
We have no rights
in the Arab worJd in generaJ.
J think what J can do more
[ r
is what Jve sta ted to do,
J think J shouJd come out even more.
J am out to my parents.
J am out to my friends,
J am out to my work,
but J think J want to encourage
other peopJe Jike me
who have nothing to Jose.
Because J have a saJary,
because my mum
has proven with time,
it took time,
that she JJ Jove me an wa.
[ y y
Now she knows,
she knows my boyfriend.
She Joves me for the way J am,
my dad as weJJ.
My friends as weJJ.
J think if ou don t teJJ an one,
y [ y
r [
the othe moms won t know
that its OK to be ga.
[ y
PeopJe shouJd be Jess shy,
more daring
when you have nothing to Jose.
Some peopJe have a Jot to Jose.
Those are not the peopJe
that shouJd do the change,
but the ones
that have nothing to Jose.
Jn Jraq, one of my friends
was hit with a car bomb
in front of me.
J chased after the triggerman
with my squad,
with one of my teams.
And we were just...
we wanted to kiJJ that guy.
[ r
Cause J couJd hea
my buddy screaming, he was hurt.
[r r
And so, we e unning
as fast as we can.
We[re just fuJJ of hate and fury
.
We just want to do
whatever we can to...
He hurt our friend,
[r
we e going to get him back.
We[re just running as fast as we can
,
with aJJ that weight.
Just sweat pouring off of us.
Through orange fieJds,
then we get to a cJearing.
Jt hit me. J mean, this bJue sky.
There was an oJd man
in a white robe and a chiJd.
Just tiJJing a fieJd, you know,
and that just...
brought me back to reaJity.
"What am J doing?
"[ [
J m a human being, J m not...
"[ r r "
J m not some inst ument of evenge.
[ [
J don t know. Jts Jike,
ou sto and ou e Jike...
y p y [r
Just peopJe doing
peopJe things here,
whe e Jm su osed to...
r [ pp
where aJJ this vioJence is happening.
And ou sto and ou e Jike...
y p y [r
J don t know, makes ou human again.
[ y
J get up in the morning,
go to the fieJds
to get my beans and my corn.
J see ripe beans and corn.
Oh, what joy!
When we get to the fieJd,
we are so happy
that we aJmost want
to just stand there
[
as its so beautifuJ.
A fieJd of corn or beans
is beautifuJ.
And every time, it gives us
fresh heart.
At the moment, J have nothing at aJJ.
J farm a smaJJ piece of Jand.
J pJant some vegetabJes to eat.
My husband has just gone
to get his pay,
but its a tin amount.
[ y
Apart from that,
J have nothing at aJJ.
There[s just a hen at home
.
Jf she Jays eggs,
J seJJ them at the market,
then J buy saJt and things,
enough to survive each day.
J have no cattJe.
J have nothing.
Yes, weJJ,
J, Estima Joseph, say
that my Jife is finished
in this country.
The ain doesn t faJJ.
r [
J can t pJant an thing to ha vest
[ y r
to feed my wife and chiJdren.
So, at the moment,
the es no mo e wood to cho
r [ r p
in the countryside
to earn money,
not even smaJJ branches
to make a bag of charcoaJ.
You can spend a day or two
without any food
for your chiJdren
who are crying at your feet.
The es no one to teJJ ou:
r [ - y
"My dear feJJow, take this.
Jts fo ou,
" [ r y
to heJp you in the country!"
We e J ing down, waiting fo death,
[r y r
because what we caJJ Jife is over.
You Jie there,
ou ve nothing fo ou chiJd en.
y [ r y r r
Nothing to give them,
nobody to heJp you.
You Jie there and wait for death.
J caJJ that "Jife finished".
Life is aJready finished.
Y [
ou don t have an animaJ to seJJ.
Yes.
Yes, Jife is compJeteJy finished.
Yes.
We had no harvest.
Jt was so dry
that my husband had 2 weJJs dug
for 70,000 rupees each.
But as the didn t find an wate,
y [ y r
the vines dried up
and we didn t have an g a es.
[ y r p
J think that my husband
aJready had debts Jast year
which he couJdn t e a.
[ r p y
Now who shouJd be paid back first?
J have no idea what to do.
The es no wate an whe e.
r [ r y r
The e was a weJJ, but its d.
r [ ry
r [ r r
The es no mo e wate.
So, how can the debts be repaid?
Thats wh he committed suicide.
[ y
This year,
J was covering a very severe drought
in western Maharastra,
in this country.
And on the one hand,
J was Jooking at
peopJe facing destitution
due to a water crisis.
On the other hand,
J was Jooking
at muJti-story buiJdings coming up
with a swimming pooJ
on every fJoor.
[r
We e not taJking about buiJdings
with 3 or 4 fJoors.
There is a pJan
for 2 twin towers in Mumbai
even now under construction,
37 fJoors each,
which means
there are 74 swimming pooJs.
[ r
Jts a twin towe.
And then, J went and Jooked at
who are the peopJe doing
the construction, these Jaborers.
AJJ the Jaborers
were JandJess Jaborers
and marginaJ farmers
who had Jeft their viJJages
as refugees of the water crisis
and the e in the cities
y[r
buiJding our swimming pooJs.
The sheer humiJiation of it,
the sheer injustice of it!
J think
the fastest growing sector in Jndia
is not software or JT.
Jt is inequaJity.
So, yeah, it makes me furious.
Jt is compJeteJy unacceptabJe to me
to see how cJoseJy
the affJuence of the few
is tied to the misery of the many.
Thats unacce tabJe.
[ p
WorJd Jeaders,
heJp us have a decent Jife.
r [ r
Othe wise we JJ sta ve to death.
[ r
Jts the fauJt of the gove nment
and poJiticians
if we have nothing to wear,
nowhere to sJeep,
and nothing to cook.
We e d ing.
[r y
Who knows
if we JJ stiJJ be aJive tomo ow?
[ rr
Who can say
if we JJ have an thing to eat?
[ y
My chiJdren are dying.
We have nowhere to Jive,
not even a roof or a pJot of Jand.
J go from viJJage to viJJage
to Jow othe eo Jes fieJds.
p r p p [
And aJJ this for what?
One day, we eat,
the next, we have to starve.
But nobody Jistens to us.
r [ r
The gove nment doesn t ca e
about our probJems.
The don t think
y [
about us poor foJk.
OnJy about themseJves.
J Jeft Pakistan
because of our Jiving conditions.
Jt was especiaJJy cJear to my wife
that my income couJd not provide
for heaJth care and schooJing.
She sacrificed herseJf for me,
for my famiJy.
J sacrificed myseJf and my famiJy too
by aJJowing myseJf
to emigrate so J couJd at Jeast
give my chiJdren an education
and heaJth care
and meet aJJ their basic needs.
J JJ neve fo get the da J Jeft.
[ r r y
J was with a few friends.
My mother came out on the doorstep.
She was hoJding my son in her arms.
J was sitting in the car.
She put my son on my Jap:
"Take a good Jook at him.
"Who knows
when ou JJ see him again?
y [ "
[ r r
J JJ neve fo get that scene.
J can stiJJ see my chiJd
as if he were right in front of me.
J Jeft Sudan because the regime
[
wouJdn t Jeave us aJone.
Entire famiJies were kiJJed.
Everyone figured
we were doomed.
The main thing was that J was saved.
God spared me.
J arrived in France.
Thanks to God,
at home, we were farmers.
And it was enough for us!
We had cattJe.
We never Jacked either money
or food.
Thanks to God, we Jived weJJ.
But the regime
wouJd not Jeave us aJone.
They raped my sisters in front of me.
When my wife arrived,
they fJogged her.
They raped her in front of me.
How couJd J Jive
in that country?
When J was in the boat,
J was very scared,
because J saw absoJuteJy nothing,
onJy the water.
And the boat aJso,
its not a uaJit boat.
[ q y
We are 110 peopJe inside the boat,
nobody comfortabJe.
There was no food to eat,
no water to drink.
You are sitting in that fueJ.
Jt destroyed aJJ my body.
Things were hard for me.
So, when J see the JtaJians,
they come and rescue us,
J thank God.
[
J know that now J m safe.
Europeans have their reasons
for Jimiting immigration.
We sta he e, but the es no wo k.
y r r [ r
There are entire famiJies
in which noone works.
Jf ou can t fish,
y [
you have nothing to do.
Thousands of Africans
die at sea, going to Europe.
[ r [
But its wo th it. J m Jeaving again.
For Spain or JtaJy.
Jve made u m mind.
[ p y
Jts in m bJood to go.
[ y
J JJ go b canoe.
[ y
J JJ go, c ing. J JJ go, shouting.
[ ry [
[
Now Jm Jiving
in the jungJe of CaJais.
The poJice come and disturb us:
"You have to Jeave the jungJe."
J said: "Where J have to go?
"Show me the pJace.
We want to go to that."
He said: "You have to go back
to your country."
"Where is my country?
J don t have a count, man!
" [ ry
" [ r
Jts a kiJJing g ound,

"Jt is not a country!
"Afghanistan is not a country now!
" [ r "
Jts a kiJJing g ound, man.
37 countries
came to controJ that country,
but they cannot controJ these peopJe.
The UN cannot controJ these peopJe!
How can you send me back
to that country?
J Jost my famiJy in that country.
How can J go back to that country?
J was a refugee in Pakistan,
a refugee in Jran,
a refugee in Dubai.
J was a refugee in Turkey,
a refugee in BuJgaria,
a refugee in a European country,
in Greece.
[ r r
And now Jm a efugee in F ance.
But Jet me Jive, man.
J don t want an thing f om ou.

J m a BangJadeshi wo ke
in the garment industry.
[ r
J m out aged
when a buyer comes to meet
the company owner
or the marketing team
to negotiate the price of his order.
And when other countries
sJash prices,
our buyer wiJJ Jook

He couJd just think:
"Jf BangJadesh suppJies me
"with good quaJity garments,
"why not pay a fair price?"
But weve aJwa s been sco ned.
[ y r
By everyone.
Not just one person in particuJar.
Jts the finaJ consume
[ r
who steaJs from me.
What can J do about it?
What can...
How wiJJ we be happy?
How?
Many things are forbidden
in the factory:
no taJking,
no answering the phone.
To go to the bathroom,
we have to ask the supervisor
for permission,
and onJy one person at a time.
As for productivity,
hes ve demanding.
[ ry
The es an hou J quota to meet,
r [ r y

Jf the uota isn t met,

but J have no other choice.

An honest wo ke isn t ich.
[
J m taJking about someone
who works in a company,
not the heir to the famiJy business.
They just juggJe
miJJions in a company.

They sit at a desk

Shes not ich.

[ r r
Losing my job was a huge shock.
Not finding another
was an even bigger shock.
You know, J worked for 27 years.
When J had to
go back to Jive with my mother,
J mainJy feJt
humiJiation.
A feeJing...
of devastation.
J sank into a deep depression.
More and more.
J said to myseJf:
J m 47 and m Jife is ove?
"[ y r
"Have J nothing eJse to offer?
"Nothing more?"
And these thoughts
stop you going out and taJking.
You Jook at yourseJf in the mirror
and say: "Who are you, moron?
"What are you pJaying at?
"What are you doing in this Jife?
"Why are you breathing?
"Why do you see the sun?
"What makes you...
"any use in this mess you Jive in?
"Why, at 47,
"did you go back
to Jive at ou mothe s?
y r r[
"Were you afraid
of being on the street?"
Y [ r
es, Jm sca ed
of being on the street.
And this humiJiation turns into rage.
Rage,
because you want to Jet off steam,
and ou don t know how.
y [
J am poor.
J wiJJ define poverty now.
What poverty means to me.
[
Jts when J have to go to schooJ,
[
but J can t go.
[
When J have to eat, but J can t.
When J have to sJee, but J can t.
p [
When my wife and chiJdren suffer.
[
J don t have
a sufficient inteJJectuaJ JeveJ
to get us out of this situation,
me or my famiJy.
J reaJJy feeJ poor.
PhysicaJJy poor, mentaJJy poor.
And you rich peopJe who Jisten to me,
what do you have to say
about your weaJth?
J know
that Jm Jess ha with mo e mone.
[ ppy r y
And J know that J stiJJ want more.
J Jike things
and J pursue the things,
but the things onJy make me happy
for a short period of time.
Then, J go back
and J have the chaJJenges of my famiJy
[
and J don t know how
to make a depressed person happy.
Y [
ou can t give them a thing
and make them happy,
because their brain is not happy.
So, J feeJ frustrated that
r [
the cu es don t exist.
And J can[t just wave a magic wand
and make my...
son...
better.
J Jived in a pJace
surrounded by viJJas.
And J Jived in a hoveJ.
J knew that peopJe
sometimes threw food away.
And we, especiaJJy me,
we were hungry.
We just wanted some food.
For me, poverty
makes me sad
because of the injustice.
Because if everyone had food,
at Jeast had fuJJ beJJies,
at home, we couJd think.
Reasoning is inteJJigence.
So, we couJd be poor,
Jive in a hoveJ,
but have the inteJJigence
to be abJe to get ahead.
Thank God,
J managed to rise above aJJ that.
But how man othe s can t?
y r [
Many die because of it.
And that is reaJJy sad.
To me that[s sheer injustice
,.
The street is a very tough schooJ.
Poverty
is a state
[
which Jm in
at the moment.
When ou e poo,
y [r r
day in and day out,
it[s not that you enjoy it
,
but you do get used to it,
quite simpJy.
Poverty is a state.
[
Jts a state
which Jasts.
And for many.
Far too many.
What wouJd J Jike to ask?
[ r
What the heJJ J m doing he e.
Wh can t J be whe e ou a e
y [ r y r
to see what the heJJ is going on?
Lets switch fo a minute.
[ r
[
Lets switch!
You come here and be me
and J JJ go the e and be ou.
[ r y
We JJ meet u
[ p
in the middJe Jine on the Equator
and we JJ Ja goJf.
[ p y
[ r
Jt doesn t matte
if J[m the president (of Uruguay)
.
[
Jve thought about aJJ this a Jot.
J spent over 10 years
in a soJitary confinement ceJJ.
J had the time...
J spent 7 years
without opening a book.
Jt Jeft me time to think.
This is what J discovered.
Eithe ou e happ with ve JittJe,
r y [r y ry
without overburdening yourseJf,
because you have happiness inside,
o ou JJ get nowhe e.
r y [ r
J am not advocating poverty.
J m advocating sob iet.
[ r y
But we invented
a consumer society...
which is continuaJJy seeking growth.
r [ r [ r
When the es no g owth, its t agic.
We invented a mountain
of superfJuous needs.
You have to keep buying,
throwing away...
Jts ou Jives we a e s uande ing.
[ r r q r
When J buy something,
or when you buy it,
we e not pa ing with mone.
[r y y
We e pa ing
[r y
with the time from our Jives
we had to spend
to earn that money.
The difference is
that ou can t bu Jife.
y [ y
Life just goes by.
[ rr
And its te ibJe
to waste your Jife
Josing your freedom.
J m not af aid of d ing.
[ r y
My chiJdren want to make me happy
so that J Jeave this Jife sereneJy.
Jf Jm ha befo e J die,
[ ppy r
J wiJJ be after, too.
J can t wo k an mo e.
[ r y r
[ r
J m so oJd that J no Jonge know
if J shouJd sJeep
on this side or that side.
J sJeep badJy.
So, J wait in my bed.
Sometimes, J teJJ myseJf
Jd be bette off dead.
[ r
At Jeast Jd be at eace.
[ p
After death,
r r [
fo me, the es nothing eJse.
[
Then, we JJ Jaugh:
[r
we e going to heaven,
[r r
but we e not taking the ight path.
When you go in the ground,
ou don t go to heaven.
y [
We e not taking the ight ath.
[r r p
[
J don t think
the es Jife afte death.
r [ r
[
J don t beJieve in aJJ that.
When J think of my grandmother
whom J Joved a Jot
and who died a Jong time ago,
J teJJ myseJf memories soon fade.
The picture becomes bJurred.
Sometimes,
the sound of the voice disappears.
What do we Jeave behind?
What remains?
That scares me.
Jts a totaJJ i ationaJ fea...
[ y rr r
which is based on something
compJeteJy archaic and tribaJ.
Jt stirs up
so many things inside of me.
[
Jts not something
which has to do with pride
or anything Jike that.
[
Jts something eJse.
[
Jts to do with the meaning of Jife.
What have we done with our Jives?
Why am J here?
[
J don t know.
[
Jd Jike to Jeave something behind.
Jd Jike to Jeave m ma k.
[ y r
The meaning of Jife...
[
J don t know
if it comes from the fact
that J don t feeJ im o tant.
[ p r
We are not important.
[
J don t see...
J don t see Jife that wa.
[ y
You just have to Jive Jife.
We aJJ have been, we aJJ are,
and we aJJ wiJJ cease to be.
J think J was born
to give birth
to one or two chiJdren.
To feed them
from infancy
[
so that, when J m oJd,
they take care of me, in return.
My biggest fear is...
is being nobody,
is being nothing...
Not knowing
wh Jm he e, what the oint is,
y [ r p
if it has meaning.
To reaJJy not be any use whatsoever,
me,
just a man among men.
J have the impression
that the es a unive saJ d namic
r [ r y
and if J m not a t of it,
[ p r
it wiJJ destroy me.
J want to be part
of the history of mankind.
Me being 15 with a Jife sentence,
what can be the meaning of my Jife?
That is a hard question.
J think
the meaning of my Jife couJd be
happiness, making everything right.
HeJping out young and oJder peopJe.
Just heJp one another.
Stand for someone.
Just stay out of troubJe,
[ r
don t come to p ison.
[
That ain t no meaning in Jife.
This ain t no Jace fo nobod.
[ p r y
[
J don t know...
Everybody has their own purpose.
J don t know what m pu pose is.
[ y r
J don t know about that uestion.
[ q
Sometimes, J think
of a phrase J heard as a boy,
a friend who said:
"Life is Jike carrying a message
"from the chiJd you were
"to the oJd man you wiJJ be.
"You have to make sure
that this message
isn t Jost aJong the wa.
" [ y "
J often think of that,
because when J was JittJe,
J used to imagine fine things,
to dream of a worJd without beggars
in which everyone was happy.
SimpJe, subtJe things.
But you Jose those things
over the course of Jife.
You just work
to be abJe to buy things.
And you stop seeing the beggar,
you stop caring.
r [
Whe es the message
of the chiJd J once was?
Maybe the meaning of Jife
is making sure that this message
doesn t disa ea.
[ pp r
Jve aJ ead asked m seJf...
[ r y y
Jve aJ ead asked m seJf
[ r y y
why J was on Earth.
[ r
J m he e...
to do what God
has pJanned for me.
Because on Earth,
everyone has a mission.
J have one, too,
but J don t know it et.
[ y
This movie is dedicated
to the thousands of peopJe
who answered our questions
with honesty, courage and kindness.
A huge thank you.
A speciaJ thank you aJso
to the Bettencourt SchueJJer Foundation
and to its team
who made this project possibJe.
Mom and Dad, you must Jisten to me:
if you can, stop the drugs.
Jve toJd ou so man times
[ y y
and J teJJ you again.
Sto the d ugs. The e bad fo ou.
p r y[r r y
The e dest o ing ou h sicaJJ.
y[r r y y p y y
Jf you remember
that Jm ou daughte, stop.
[ y r r
Do it for me.
J have a younger brother...
J have a JittJe brother who died.
He Jeft behind a 4-year-oJd girJ.
UnfortunateJy,
the mother of the girJ is dead, too.
[ r r
So, Jd Jike to teJJ that b othe
that he shouJdn t wo.
[ rry
r r[
J knew this b othe s Jove
for his daughter.
He shouJd know
that she is in good hands,
that J take very good care of her.
J m a Jad of the night
[ y
and J have a message for my parents.
Don t wo an mo e.
[ rry y r
[
Jts OK now.
J can fuJfiJJ my mission.
J can Jook after
my brothers and sisters.
The e at home and wiJJ stud.
y[r y
The JJ com Jete thei studies,
y[ p r
J promise.
[
J don t want them
to have a hard Jife.
They must study for years.
Jt wiJJ make me happy,
because J wasn t so Juck.
[ y
The JJ com Jete thei studies.
y[ p r
J want them to study
as Jong as possibJe.
[
J don t have the inteJJigence
to do anything eJse,
but J want my brothers and sisters
to finish their studies.
There are two things
Jd Jike to teJJ ou.
[ y
Don t fo get who ou a e
[ r y r
and aJways smiJe.
SmiJing is the onJy Janguage
everyone understands.
Y [ r
ou ve b ought up
a Jot of things for me today.
ou ve made me feeJ im o tant.
Y [ p r
ou ve made me feeJ
Y [
that J have something to offer,
that J had a pJace to go.
You made me feeJ
Jike my stories were weJcome.
And you made me feeJ happy.
J think peopJe need to
feeJ that they have done something
whiJe the ve Jived.
y[
They need to feeJ
that the ve cont ibuted.
y[ r
And today,
you made me feeJ Jike J contributed.
And Jm ve g atefuJ to ou
[ ry r y
for that.
Thank you.
My message is that you are
weJcome to my home.
Come to my home.
J invite you aJJ!
Every tribe:
Ovatua, Ovahimba,
Ovambo, Ovangandjiera.
Y [r
ou e aJJ weJcome.
Today, in this worJd,
we hear
about peopJe who make fiJms.
We hear this kind of story,
but now...
that UJJa and EmmanueJ are here,
that the e making a fiJm,
y[r
everyone wiJJ see where we Jive,
in my viJJage.
J am so happy.
Seeing more fiJm-peopJe coming here
wouJd make me very happy.
The worJd wiJJ get to know us.
J don t know if the JJ see me,
[ y[
but J am very happy
to taJk now
and to those who wiJJ come.
TeJJ them.
r [
The es nothing to add.
We taJked about peace.
We taJked about everything.
[ [ r
Weve finished, its ove.
