May I invite you all to join
me in a toast?
Yes, you can.
One year's out and in the end
we're all still breathing.
Gin - fucking gin!
Gin - fucking gin!
Yeah.
We'll be celebrating later, aren't you?
Uh, Jesus Christ!
Oh, we're going to be right at the end of that--
Get off me.
Chris, I've seen you in the shower
you were to be in heaven!
- It's the old lad.
- Oh, bad to be on that!
Shut, fucking you, right!
She's just want to bring you up.
So easy!
I'll go to another announcement.
I got a placement to work and gone.
Congratulations, dude.
6 months.  And I am to
start in September.
And...?
The fucking practice,
All do I ... shippings,
all the high power plants,...
Shipping costing world!
Smile everyone!
It's not ideal, obviously, but...
Are you to need a train right away?
It isn't America or something?
You're deciding too fast!
I just found out this afternoon.
Look!  Look, look, look!
You're right,  I shall discuss with them.
What's up, guys!
He's the laugh dog.
Luke!
What's up, bro?
So...
- What do you get for us?
- For Paul also...
How about a drop of
the white stuff, tickle soft?
Paul first, doen't he?
I should not...
- Almost for Paul, man.
- Yes.
- Go!
- OK!
- Spend a good night?
-Yes.
I bought a good one, boyo!
- What's up, Felix?
- Nothing, pal!
- Did you make move?
- I'm on Gemma.
Want a teammate,
anything wrong?
That's not true as you said.
The set is definitely not gold.
No matter how much we might want him to.
It's just a matter of confidence.
And this is an area
that I maybe help you out.
My side, honey.
Come on, I'm so excited.
Anyway you like!
Hi, Gemma.
- Hello, Felix.
- Can we talk?
Okay.
I mean, obviously,
you are my league,
but I thought it out
just because it worths me.
As what?
If  you would like to go out
with me sometime.
Something like a coffee or a film.
Sit.
Paul?
I do not think of you
in the same way as you expect.
But I'm sure there's
someone else helps it out.
You just have to be brave
and keep looking.
You're a good girl,
thanks.
Seriously, you're a sweety plunge.
Unlike some
people I know.
So why do you go out with him?
Truth or Dare, everyone?
10... 9... 8...
7... 6... 5...
4... 3... 2... 1...
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I've already been over it.
Truth or Dare,
Mr. Gum?
Truth, probably.
Uh... "True, probably."
So truth.
Be nice.
So, Felix...
Tell me...
If you had a golden ticket,
and you could pick any girl,
or any guy,
to take upstairs
for a very quick making fast,
no question asked,
so,
who would it be?
In fact, here it is...
your free shag ticket.
Who is the lucky girl, Felix?
Who is it, Felix?
Who is the lucky girl, Felix?
I'm sorry.
I want to play.
I want to play, come on.
Come on, let's play.
Truth or Dare, bitch?
You and me.
Put it normal way, Chris!
You're just mocking about!
- Truth.
Do I look like a muff to you? 
- Uh-uh!
So, why do you're pissing in my path?
I was just...
- I was just playing--
- Oh, you just past...
- Playing a game!
- Oh, just playing!
- You  fuck with Gemma, do you?
- No.
Nay!
Oh, that's far, that was an accident.
An exemption, huh?
No. Leave me alone!
You're a little shit!
Are you all right, Felix?
Are you fucking cry
with my fucking girl?
He fucking cries by the own
damned fucking passion!
That was intense.
You're suck of us!
This what your point is?
You are quite a kluck girl!
Cheer it!
Yeah.
How was your Christmas?
Quite boring!
It's good to be out about again.
- You didn't come to McGinty.
- I couldn't make it.  How was it?
- Gemma was there.
- So?
Could say it's hot.
You know she's toughed to me, right?
Yeah, I've heard.
I'm going to keep myself up.
She was one to a chance.
I've been said romance was dead.
Oh, all it was bloody Felix's fault.
Why?
That was months ago.
- You're sure that it's a big deal?
- Yeah, I works to her,
such a scene of the real me
fucking blow.
I'll tell you why.
On one night,
I'll knock a couple of punches
on that swishy old face of his.
So why exactly
are we going to his birthday party?
I don't know.
Free booze, good time, as usual?
His parents own a palace.
Yeah, it's huge.
Top of country house!
Old man is judge.
I thought it up, she's going to be there.

£ 35.59.
I feel like suck and sick
in this outfit.
Like chicken Paul.
You think...
He's been back a couple of days
now we still haven't...uh...
think he lost interest?
In you?
Hard to believe, honey?
The Hautbois family owns...
The Hautbois's family.
- The Hautbois family...
- Yes.
owns expensive properties
in Cambridge area and Stanford.
The dictate has been the family feet
since the seventeenth century.
The ground includes a private lake...
and several hundred acres
of plenty of plants.
Suckle it,
how long you did?
Sudden obsession with money!
Like any of us is poor.
Eleanor's father filed
a bankruptcy over the summer.
- Shit!
- I'm very sorry.
Everybody's happiness isn't mine.
I mean, taken Mr. Gum, as what?
- Oh, he's all right.
- Kind of cute.
In such a newest kind of way.
Uh, I know he bring out
the maternal in your girl,
something with honesty, I think.
I think he's a creep.
Oh, you should write it
in his birthday card.
Did you just use the word "maternal"
to describe me?
Are you sure this is the right place?

Wow!
My boy.
- You're right?
- Yeah, nice to see you.
- Hello, boys.
- Hi, Gemma.
Hi, Chris.
Hi, Luke.
You guys' been how long?
Just go in.
So where's the party?
Hello?
Here we go.
Hi there,
we all come to the party.
- The house is closed out.
- We can see it, right?
We are friends of Felix.
- Friends of Felix?
- It's his birthday.
He wants to keep in cabin.
You have to follow the trail in the woods
for about 800 meters.
Right. Thank you.
You'll have to walk.
The track's too rough for city cars.
It's OK!
Well come to the country, folks!
It's just me!
I see a bit spooky.
It's just you, pussy!
- What's up?
- Sewage!
It was far enough the way!
We're on the edge then.
Uh... Stop that, you'll take me.
What?
Shoes, £ 300.
Come on.
Time to go.
Spoken like a true lady.
Oh!  Be careful, little!
My shoes will quickly fall in mud.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, elegance!
Elegance.
Hop up!
Okay, here we go.
So...
How's you been?
Good!
Great, actually.
- And you?
- Okay.
- Course of definite gentle eyes, Gemma.
Really?
Yes, you know
all these different kinds of people.
It's nicer than a while ago, yeah.
Guess if we just take a carny.
Makes you realize it's not as special as
you want to.
Just help to expose
pondering himself  deprecation.
Is it working?
You haven't changed
your tune, have you?
- What's the matter?
- It's not funny.
Hi!
- I'm Justin.
- Ding dong.
- Felix's old brother.
- Hi.
Sorry about the mud.
- Hi, I'm Gemma.
- Nice to meet you.
I'm Chris.
Pardon me!
Right.
To explain has been
a bit of a catch up.
Felix should have been back yesterday,
but ended up getting stuck in port.
- Chile hold places.
- Chile?
Yes, I know, it's bizarre.
He's being volunteered in a hospital project
and has a fantastic time.
By all the chances,
the birthday's bought to him
in surprise, then--
Well then, his flight got canceled.
I've been ringing around
putting people off,
but haven't done about good job of it,
evidently.
So, there is no party?
I'm really sorry.
But look, there's plenty to drink,
plenty to eat, and places to crush.
You're more than welcome to hang out here;
as matters of fact we hope to do well.
I know that Felix will approve.
Come on!  Lets do this!
- Luke. It is Luke, right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Great.
Grab 6 blanc, my friends,
I'll practice it as it's bubling.
Lets on the party, then.
- He is a hottie!
- He's okay!
Look at him,
such a cage fighter.
- All wild and fierce.
- And rich too, don't forget!
Uh, he's perfect.
It's unusual talking
to your boyfriend.
What boyfriend?
You do ask me love Paul, then.
Honey, right now, I can't
even remember his name.
So what you do, Justin?
I'm in the Army now.
Wow!  Respect.
- Been in combat?
- Afghanistan.
3 tolls!
Tired of all the blood and dust.
- So, you are with Eleanor, right?
- For my sins, yes.
Though, I'm not convinced to go anywhere.
Don't worry! Do it--
But you and Gemma very much?
- Go back!
- Why?  You're interested?
No.  Now she knows my
tough drive of Felix's history there.
Yes, right!
What's the job!
Do you think it's too good for him?
Well, you may have made the end of some,
he will captive well.
- Hydrogen?
- Yes, please.
No, more booze for me!
Seems do it?
Seems being in awktest word, man.
This will cheer up.
Times Felix can't be here,
he is always talking about you guys.
Really?
- Yeah.  You are his friends, right?
- Yes.
We are his very very very good friends,
or something kiddo, Mr. Felix.
So, tell us about Chile.
Must have been a big decision.
The family thought he was doing good.
Tough about finally.
Make him big and stronger
as his big brother.
Oh, my Lord. You have to feel it,
mine likes a rock, Gemma.
Sorry for her.  Excuse her!
How strange!
No, excuse me.  Come one!
Have a big...
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.
I froze out.
My God.
Go.
Oh!  Sorry!
Hi there!
You caused all of those scars?
I've been
in a lot of scrapes.
How about that one?
It was teenage experiment.
I wanted to see if I can take the pain.
Could you?
Comfortably.
We are to have some balloons.
I could have a better idea.
Truth or Dare?
Dare.
Any suggestions?
I think we need set
the prize up a bit.
- What do you think, boy?
- Yes.
I can do sexy.
Eleanor...
I dare you .. .
to give Gemma...
a long hot wet kiss on the mouth.
- Tongue?
- Absolutely.
Excuse,
do I get to say in this?
No.  No.  No.
Loose the game, babe.
Oh Yes, I'm still for that.
And all of you expect
Chris and me to do that.
I don't even quiz you!
Yes, that's what I'm saying.
I get enough of that in the army.
Hey, hey!  Stop joking with it,
and spin with the lucky  bottle top.
Truth or Dare, Gemma?
Uhm, mine is now truth.
Please, take me back.
This is not the time.
It's the perfect time!
Truth, Gemma!
- I love you.
- Oh, shit, Chris!
- Give me another chance.
You know you want to.
No, Sorry!
Serious pasco, Chris!
I had the number passed me.
I choose truth.
Felix isn't in Chile.
So, where is he?
Well, what happened was
that he hung himself.
What?
He hung himself.
Right here, from that cross beam there.
- Is this a joke, man?
- No joke, man.  It's what happend.
I'm in Afghanistan
chilling in sweat and fear and blood.
And when I get home, my cape
brother's hung swinging from there, after.
The guard has cut him down.
True story.
But this is terrible.
It's a harsh stuff !
Actually, 16 generations
of French Catholics...
suicide about this shame for the regain,
not to mention a fact of copout.
So, why are we here?
I need to get the bottom of it.
Family honor is at stake.
I need to know what happened.
So, there's a party,
and it's just us?
It's worse to see
some sources of setup.
You're the his friends.
I thought you might be able to help.
Come on, Paul.
We're going.
I can't drive.
I'm pissed.
There was a party at the end of
the Summer term.
I think something might happen there.
He killed himself, man.
It's sad but it happens.
I don't see what we can do about it.
And you shouldn't have brought us
to come here under false pretenses.
That's just our order.
This was in his pocket.
Did any of you send it?
This is the key.
It's what drove him to it.
"Truth or dare, bitch? "
What does this mean?
I mean you're his friends,
you must have some idea.
I have enough of this.
I'm leaving.  Anyone coming?
- But we can't take the cars.
- Yeah, we can take our chances.
I'm not finish yet, Chris.
Go I am!
Chris decides.
I can't do that.
- My God!
- Take it easy!
- Justin, no!
- One step more!
See this.
My God!
This is what happens when
people don't follow order.
Luke, chairs, bring them.
Do it!
Justin!  I'll tell you the easy can be
complicated, really!  You got it wrong!
All wrong!  We haven't done
anything.  You need to--
Gemma, be quiet!
Eleanor, Gemma, take a seat!
It is that, isn't it?
This is why are we here?
I said take a seat.
Luke.
Their hands.  Bandage!
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Somebody help!
No phone calls, people!
It's a lucky common sense.
Luke, bring the other chairs.
Snap to it!
Things like of the car keys and the mobil phones
to the lock box on the workbench.
I know you're waiting, right?
Taking the right moment!
This is not that measure.
I'm clicking this
and you're not going to... done!
And, I absolutely well make it.
Now, I need you to get up slowly,
go to that chair with your hands
behind your back, and sit down.
Can you do that for me?
You don't have to say anything.
Just nod if you agree.
I just need you...
on that chair.
You drove all this...
to yourselves, guys.
But it's going to be over very soon.
I just see one of you to own
of sending the postcard.
- I'm in rule in here.
- We don't if know who sent the card.
- Please, we don't know.
- He does not care if we know or not.
He just wants to screw with us.
Exactly! 
You have a few minutes to talk it over.
I'll be outside.
But I'll be watching.
Luke!
With me!
Did you send the postcard, Luke?
No way, man!
I hardly knew your brother.
No offense .
Being just a party guy,
I bring the drugs and mix the drinks.
Sallow flux, usually.
They should be
thanks you, Luke.
If you have no time to help out,
things might have got a little more...
messy.
You're a good man.
Business is this postcard...
I don't know, maybe you should just...
let it go.
- I can not do that, man.
Many doubt did you see that, right?
Yeah, I mean, you're obviously
upset about what happened.
I am upset, Luke.
I'm very upset.
I don't want to play this game.
Of course not!
This is fucking fault talk.
What you said, Chris,
"Truth or Dare, bitch.",
what you said to Felix.
What are you trying to say?
- That I sent the postcard?
- Well, I know I didn't send it.
You bitch just are setting me up, aren't you?
- You're going to tell him about the fight.
- Calm down, Chris!
Don't tell tell me to "calm down, Chris"!
Shut the hell up!
That asshole is going to get us killed!
He says he didn't send.
He said this way.
He said, "Truth or dare, bitch".
Did you?
Uh...
It's not secret, others people had.
They could have the party on.
Yes, but it was you who said it.
So what if I said it?
What is the fuck with I void
the postcard for 5 faces?
- Because I chuck you, isn't it?
- What?
I said that because of the way
you treated to Felix.
I said that was why I was dummy.
- Shit-
- I didn't send the postcard!
If Chris says he didn't send the postcard,
then he didn't send the fucking postcard.
End of discussion!
All of us are in the shit here.
All of us!
Now lets focus on
and get out of here, OK?
Now keep twisting of you tapes.
The Scott tape's strong, but it's stretched.
One of us might be able to put his hands free.
So tell me about the party.
- What do you want to know ?
- Did you see Felix there?
- Yeah, I saw him.
- We talked to him. It would seem he liked you.
He was good, you know?
He was fine.
Chris mentioned something with Gemma.
Since it's expensive there,
I told him to go for it, you know,
at the end of the term, everything goes.
- You think you should be proud of it, Luke.
- No way!
He just need to be confident,
because that's most the girls like.
He'd better confident.
So you sold him drugs?
Just a couple of lights, I swear.
I just wanted to help.
That was en error adjustment.
I'm just a party guy.
Gemma, there's a workbench
just a few feet behind you.
There is a drawer and maybe
some tools that we can use.
Okay, I'll try to reach it.
There will be a phone line
that goes ahead to the main house.
Probably the burglar alarm, too.
So, we need to....
When you take it, appreciate the corner.
Aleane, how are you doing?
okay?
Better than you, babe.
I'll be okay.
I'll be OK!
You think Chris
could have sent the card?
I don't know.
Maybe.
But really, I don't know.
Can I count on you, Luke?
Of course.
Might get little hairy!
- Aren't you getting any ideas?
- Absolutely no.
I just want to get through this.
We all do.
Good man.
Luke?
Now who sent the card, Justin?
Seriously,
you said you're going to find, didn't you?
Just set astray of who I am.
No one will talk.
You have my words.
Here is the deal...
Someone owns up to
sending the postcard...
- I'll let you go.
- And if no owns up?
- I mean back to the Truth or Dare.
- You're full of shit, man.
I'm going to see the source of what.
Truth or Dare, Gemma?
Pick one!
Truth.
Who do you think sent the postcard?
- I don't know.
- I want your honest opinion.
Honestly, I don't know.
You bastard!
Let's try that again.
In your honest opinion,
who among the people getting here
do you think most likely...
to sent the postcard?
Chris.
Oh... oh, Gem!
I'm sorry,
I didn't know who else to say.
Oh, she does not know, Justin.
She says it because she's scared.
Gemma dump Chris because of Felix.
- Maybe you want to revenge.
- That's ridiculous!
- While were were driving you just said
that you wanted to hit him.
- Yeah, I want to hit everyone.
- Did you send the card?
- I did not, fuck!
Wait!
What was the postmark?
What was the date on the card?
September 7.
London.
I was in fucking Spain, you tougher,
three whole weeks.
Paul, Paul, you can vouch me.
The first week of September I can't
close to the lake because I was in Spain.
Yes, right, he was in Spain.
- In case of that someone to pay it for you.
- Oh, come on!
You could have got your mom to post that.
I don't bloody know if
you wanted it or not, you guy!
- Maybe you sent it in place of me--
- Bull shit!
- Bull shit, you've sent it!
Bull shit, you want another guy!--
- Can you pick to sway it?  You can send out!
Now, I want a confession,
or playing until we get one.
Truth or Dare, Chris?
Dare, you fuck!
Dare with it.
One moment.
Luke?
- What the fuck!
- Help us!
- I can't, I can't.
- Please.
We call this...
the "Acid Test".
Easy to improvise.
Very useful...
in motivating prisoners.
This next part...
isn't fairly filthy.
Open up!
Now...
it is much easier...
if you relax.
Leave her alone, you bastard!
Two containers.
One tap water.
One battery acid.
You have to choose.
That's the dare.
No, I'm not going to do.
Tell me who sent the card.
I don't fucking know, all right?
Chris, under it a good half.
If you choose, Gemma goes on
50-50 chance to surviving.
If I choose,
she got absolutely none at all.
Now left...
or right?
You're sick, man!
You're psychotic!
Come on, tough guy!
You can do it.
- Pick one.
- You're a fucking psychopath.
Who sent the postcard?
If I knew, I wouln't think I tell you.
I don't know!
5 seconds, Chris!
Five.
- Four...
- Please, don't hurt her.
- Please, Justin, done anything right!
- Three!  I give you a hint.  I'm left handed.
Left handed, left handed.
Two...
- Turn the right tap.
- He's playing with you.
- It's up to Chris.
- Saying left, then I'll pick right.
Maybe it's not going to hurt Gemma.
- He has to hurt.
- What?
Left.
- I choose the left tap.
- Lap tap turning on.
Good course, Chris.
Babe, babe,
I am sorry.
I'm sorry, baby, made me choose.
I just put babe's time to question now.
I'm so sorry.  He made me choose!
The right interest made me.
Round, round and round it goes.
Where will it stop?
Nobody knows.
All right.
I'll play.
Truth.
Why us?
Why do you?
Why us five?
Why choose us?
The postcard's by Felix's bed.
Five faces crack out.
Your faces.
That doen't prove anything.
It was good enough for Felix.
It's good enough for me.
That's fair enough!
Truth.
Who do you think should take the tap next?
None.
No one should.
You have to choose the quaint.
Or taste the tap yourself.
Who are you going to choose?
Fuck you!
- 5 seconds.  4... 3... 2...
- Chris.
- Uh,  I'm so sorry.
- That wasn't so hard with him.
I'm Sorry!
I need a drink.
Luke.  Please.
Look in the toolbox.
Find something you can
use as a weapon.
Something small to hide,
such as a screwdriver, maybe.
- He's too fast.
- No, no, no... no one is going too fast.
When he brings the bottles,
he's distracted.
It isn't there, consider it all over.
I don't know, man.
He's going to kill us, Luke.
And when he's done with us,
he will kill you.
Think about it, he will kill you!
Chris...
Tell me?
It was me.
I sent the postcard. I confess.
- You were in Spain.
- I wrote it before I left.
I got my mon to send it.
Eleanor was right.
Everyone was right.
It's me!
I'm sorry, Chris.
You convinced me of the first time around
someone asks to have another one.
What a saying nobody believes!
- Come on, everthing will be OK, man!
- Fuck saying!
- Please! No! No!  No!
- Man of the fellows!
Do you want the truth, Justin?
- Your brother was a creep.
- No, that's not true!
That's it!
For all the ages, a creep!
A weird, alone switching and desperate.
I thought you were his friends.
Stephanie's friends?
No one liked him!
None of us.
So you just watched
while Chris beat him around?
I didn't see the fight.
But I saw Felix.
He was up stair, in the bed room.
I don't know why
he's looking down on me, and--
- Felix's watching us!
- What?
I was getting a blow job,
and Felix stood staying in the doorway
staring at me...
with my dick out.
I told him to go out, naturally.
Get it watch, you bloody queer!
For mad, that word I believe.
And you said my brother was queer?
Are you saying
that my brother is a fagot?
I'm saying I don't know
who sent that postcard.
And I don't fucking care!
None of we cares... about Felix.
We just came for the free booze.
- Left or right, Paul?
- Go fuck yourself!
Left or right?
- Left.
- Left it is.
Bastard!
No!
Paul was right.
We want Felix is frank, not purposely,
but did speak to him
on the night of the party
and he was gentle, Justin.
He was vulnerable and lonely.
But he had a kind soul.
He would not want this.
You didn't know at all.
He wouldn't want
this cruelty.
I'm sure that.
Perhaps you're right.
At least half part of
what you're saying.
Felix was closed,
criple, even.
But we came from the same lineage.
We were forged in the same fire.
This weakness was not
what he was made of.
All this is in his name.
But if he was watching
him each second quiet--
We are a proud family, Gemma.
People like you can't understand that...
shame drove him to do what he did.
And pride
demands payment for that life.
His pride, my pride.
- Please.
- Enough talk.
It's time to play the game.
Hello?
Hello?
Friend of your?
It's Jonesy.  Open up!
Get rid of him.
I'll be listening.
You... you're staying,
I am calling for hours.
- I'm sorry, man.
- Not a sound, people!
I thought there might be some...
country house bigger by.
Now just throw me white powder.
No one here. Just screwing in this.
I'll come in to say hi.
Seriously, do not go in there.
Seriously, I was in the road for 3 hours.
20 pounds count from this station,
20 for this mud, to follow your fucking GPS.
Plus other shits for the gear.
I am supposed to be shipping tonight.
Forgive me,
it's private party.
- You seem aren't one that I could count on, Luke.
- What do you mean?
Did you stand in me?
- No!
That's easy!  You are here
selling your gear, you don't need mine.
- You got it all wrong, man.
- Shtt, fine, fine!
It' cool, boy! 
You're easy showing.
For the fuck thing, Jonesy.
I should now go in see, if you would like.
I'm hold on your give up!
- I'm coming to show you....
- Just go away!  Just go!
I am just explaining about
the private party.
No problem.
Get a cab.
Be careful!
Why don't you join us?
I do not want to intrude.
Maybe we get another time.
- Guide me.
- Turn around and swing back.
That's it.
Okay.
Come inside, don't you?
Quick. Come on!
You can get it on.
Just go for it!
Just go for it!
Lets see if you like it.
Gem, listen to me!
Focus. There's a saw,
feel it with your fingertips!
I can't reach it.
Don't kill him!
I can't let him live, can I?
- Please!
- Weakness, Luke! Weakness!
Gem!
Come!
Yes, you can.
Please.
I'll tell you one thing,
3 bullets left.
50-50 chance
to get alive, bro!
If he lives,
I'll let him go.
You want me to shoot him?
Wake up, Luke!
I'm giving you
a chance to save him.
Or you can point the gun at me,
but you only get one chance.
And there's no bullet...
Well ..
It's in your hands.
Please don't shoot me.
Not to me, it's time.
Decision time, Luke!
Me or your friend?
God!
Anyway,
50-50.
It's time to pick a side.
Five seconds.
Four...
- No!
- Three...
Two...
One.
Please, Luke!
Gemma, Gemma, run.
- Run .
- What about you and Paul?
Save time. Gemma,
please run. Go.
Shit.
She could help!
With those weapons we...
We could have fought.
We could run away.
You can't run anywhere, babe.
You did well, Luke.
You showed gut.
Oh, you can be in family
now I can trust you on it.
What if someone finds out?
Trust me, Luke.
We're some distance above the law.
Once this is all over,
we can just disappear.
Lie over my father people
deal with the loose things.
Your father knows about this?
This helps him to change
more than anyone else.
My duty was clear,
restore the family honor
by any mean necessary.
I knew he has mine backed.
He doesn't want to lose another son.
You sent the postcard to him?
No.
- Did you?
- No.
Glad before his paid up.
This is the last, Luke.
You're almost there.
I need you to be strong.
Can I count on you, Luke?
Yes.
Paul.
I think my hands are going to free.
Guard them!
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, my God!
Felix.
Cut us free, Luke.
I don't think so.
What?
Do it when you can touch.
I killed Jonesy.
So what, huh?
What do you think
I am going to tell you?
Luke, Luke!
Look at me!  Look at me!
I do not care how many people
you killed, okay?
Tell me this stuff, please.
Lets own this, not Paul.
Now come on,
cut it for us.
Are you enjoying what you see?
I hope you're satisfied.
I know...
I know I let you down.
I should expect him when
Chris punch in you first plea.
You could have talked to me.
I'd listened.
What is it?
I said...
put him down
would have been better to let him die.
His brother goes crazy.
Need to call the police.
You got now what's going to his brain, see.
Because of the rope.
After he died the wane,
now he does not walk no more.
Better off death way back.
I need to call the police.
Asked it, Justin...
said he did not need help, fucking bugger.
Just move away from the bed.
You look after him, right?
It's your job to keep him alive.
So if you just
put the gun on the bed,
and leave the room, you're just
keep doing your job, right?
Please .
Just go.
I need a phone, Felix.
Come on!
Shit.
Help!
Justin can help me.
He said his family
will protect me.
And you believe him?
He's an army man.
Loyalty is important to him.
Excuse me, Luke.
In case you haven't noticed it, he meant it.
He's obsessed with the fucking postcard.
And you're on the list.
Remember?
You are one with the cut out faces.
When you finish us off, Luke,
you're the only one left.
You sent it?
You sent the fucking postcard?
Shut up.
Luke. For God's sake!
Why?
I don't know!
I was with Jonesy, and we were
just looking Felix surf on the net,
just something to do.
His family was so stinking rich.
This just warmed me up.
People like me have to dust,
unlike this blue gut cut who got it all!
It's just the law, you know!
A little more to remind you, buddy,
what is it so important after all?
Look at himself, that way he did that.
You ask for what?
All of it was just the postcard!
How was I supposed to know
he did kill himself?
I couldn't have known it.
He must to be unstable,
unlike his brother.
It wasn't your fault.
See?
Uh!  Help!
- Did you do that?
- Let go off me!
Truth!
You did that to him?
He did it himself.
I sat by him...
for days, weeks.
I knew that he was still alive inside.
I Knew that he'd be ashamed
of what he did,
ashame weakness.
I knew that he's told me
with his brain.
It must not be like Felix.
Paralyzed, powerless.
You had whatever you could.
You wanted Felix
deliver the names.
We were not the people who beat him up.
Please just unjustify his suicide.
And just unjustify this revenge.
Perhaps you're right.
But it's a bit late now.
She is a pretty girl.
I can see why you like her.
I Just want you to have
another girl than the other.
What would you do without me?
Luke.
Luke.
I'm dying, man.
I'm dying.
Don't know that.
I have holes in me.
I'm losing my blood.
It is not hard to see.
I need a doctor.
Or I'll die.
I'll call, Luke.
Give me one phone call.
It's all I ask.
Just...
Just give me a final chance.
Luke!
I'm begging you.
This.
What are you doing?
Luke, folks.
We need a phone, Luke.
Luke!
Sorry, man.
Sorry.
This relieves the pain.
Get away from me, fucking coward!
I'm trying to help.
Luke.
Give me a some.
What have you done for me?
Everyone knows on the beach, Luke.
You can't tell me
I'm not paying for it.
What do you want?
Coke, weed, anything.
We might love the good stuff.
No-oh!
No!  No!
Fuck!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Leave me!
Just get away from here!
Get help!
Get help!
Stop!
Stop being so fuzzy ankle, okay?
Shit!
Paul, run!
Help me, please.
Make it ever, Paul, please.
Hi,  Mr. Gum.
Hi, Mr. Gum.
Still got one bullet left,
soldier boy.
Use it.
Good idea.
Magnificent.
I'm not finished yet.
Let's just go.
I want a word with Felix
first.
He's cripple now.
He is bloody paralyzed,
just like it be!
Wait in the car, Paul.
- I want to be alone.
- No! No!
Just go, please!
Truth or Dare, Mr. Gum?
Sorry!
What was up?
I can't hear you.
Leave him alone.
Shut up, ugly!
This is all your fault.
Think about this.
When exactly did Felix
shrink himself up?
The night after the party?
No.
The night before his
big brother came home.
Truth, Felix?
Who were you afraid of?
Who made you so fucking scared
that you rather die?
And have him find out what happened.
Show me with your eyes, Felix.
Show him.
What's about, brother?
It was meant to be a fucking joke.
Little pike...
teach my lazy ass boyfriend a lesson.
I was slunk in with Felix.
And we two really....
That's all it is about.
He hanged himself.
My dad's company went down
the plan a few months ago.
Not as you've given to us, Justin.
But I thought that just maybe
the Hautbois family could help out.
I sent Felix an email,
all polite,
wondering, if ... uh...
he could talk to his family
about reflating my dad's company.
An investment
to be clear.
Not a fucking handout.
That said...
I did remind him...
of the night we sat together.
And how would be
a task embarrassing if uh....
Well, if anyone found out about it.
Which is technically blackmail.
I suppose that, whatever.
I filmed it.
You see!
Zaky!
I think we can own the grenade.
That's truth, huh?
Here.
It will help to the pain.
Thanks to the party, guys!
She's dead.
We're done here.
