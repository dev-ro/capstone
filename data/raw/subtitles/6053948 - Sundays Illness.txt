A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM
Don't be insistent,
move on to another group.
Move fluidly and be brief and concise
when answering questions,
without being too familiar.
Some of my guests are a bit special,
you know what I mean.
If you drop a tray, withdraw quietly,
others have been assigned
to apologize and clean up.
And finally, no accessories.
No rings, piercings, bracelets
or earrings.
I'm sure you'll do an excellent job.
Thank you all.
Wine?
White, please.
Sorry!
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry.
-That's okay.
-Are they disturbing you?
-No, I love dogs.
-Really?
-Can I feed him?
-Yes, but he'll love you forever.
Even better.
-Should I intervene?
-No, it's fine.
They must like you, normally
they're not so affectionate.
Don't take that bottle.
Bring it to me, please.
Hello, Ricardo. How are you?
Hello. Would you like
to have a drink with us?
No, thank you,
I have an interview.
I'll see you next week. Nice to see you.
I ordered you tea.
And a bottle of sparkling water,
please.
You don't want anything?
Can you take off your glasses?
Sorry.
Sorry!
I don't think they'll let you
smoke here.
They forbid it but nobody notices
if you do.
Unless someone complains, of course.
Sure.
There's always one of those
in a place like this.
Your family doesn't know, do they?
No.
You've never told anyone?
No.
It's weird.
What is?
Almost not existing.
It's weird.
How did you find me?
It's easy to find a vain person.
How did you get into my house?
If I tell you, you'll probably
try to retaliate against someone
-who isn't at fault.
-Only to know if it was difficult.
Not at all.
I could have massacred everyone.
I'm joking.
Excuse me, ma'am.
You can't smoke here.
You see?
She said I could, I'm sorry.
-No, you can't.
-Okay, I'm putting it out.
What do you want?
I need you to spend ten days with me.
What?
That.
Ten days.
It's not a threat.
You can think it over if you want.
Thank you.
What's left over is the tip.
How much?
She doesn't want money.
How could you go and meet
with her without telling me?
-For God's sake, Anabel.
-I wanted to resolve it myself.
What does she want?
To spend ten days with me.
Where?
I don't know.
I got up and left
before she could tell me.
-Did she threaten you?
-No.
How old is she?
Forty-two or forty three, maybe.
Her name is Chiara.
She's my daughter and I abandoned her
when she was eight years old.
Are you sure that it's her?
Yes.
Why?
I see myself in her.
You can go in,
they'll be with you in a moment.
Would you like anything?
Coffee?
No.
Please, take a seat.
We called you
because we'd like to clarify
some things about your...
peculiar request.
To spend ten days with Mrs. Barnuevo.
Yes.
For example, what's the agenda
scheduled for the period
you'd be spending together?
-Agenda?
-Yes.
I mean a calendar of...
Let's say, activities.
There is none.
You're not going to do anything?
We'll do something.
We'd like to know
if there's a quicker solution.
Financial compensation, for example.
No.
Any other kind?
No.
I'd like to know what
you're getting out of this.
Understand that it's a little
strange for us.
Accepting that you appear
out of nowhere after 30 years
only to spend a few days
on vacation with my wife.
If I'd known how to find her sooner
I wouldn't have waited so long.
What if she says no?
I don't know, I haven't considered that.
Why not?
Because of what we are.
We've prepared a contract
stipulating that in exchange
you renounce any relationship
with Mrs. Barnuevo.
It's simply a way to make sure
that there won't be any more
requests like this in the future.
You can take it and read it
at your leisure.
That won't be necessary.
Anything else?
There wasn't a restaurant
with better parking options?
You'd have more options
if you arrived on time for once.
We went ahead and ordered
for all three of us.
I'll order something for myself.
We have something important
to tell you.
Are you separating?
No, it's not that.
One of you is sick?
No, Anabel is going to be away
for ten days.
And we wanted to tell you.
Where are you going?
It's a matter I can't resolve myself
and she's going to handle it.
What matter?
Please!
Why are you telling me?
You never do.
I have another daughter
who I haven't seen since she was eight.
And she's asked me
to spend a few days together.
Are you both crazy?
You sound like you've lost your minds.
What if she wants to kill you?
No, sweetie...
Everything's under control.
Would you ever have told me
if she hadn't shown up?
Or would I never have found out?
We'll discuss that later on.
Will you excuse me?
I'm dying for a cigarette.
Why haven't you seen each other
in all this time?
She was raised by her father.
Why?
You abandoned her?
Yes.
Then, you know...
Be nice to her.
How is Mathieu?
Seeing my father isn't part of the deal.
Don't worry.
How is he?
Well...
He's dead.
What happened?
He smoked too much, you know.
He's buried in the town cemetery
if you want to visit him.
Who lives here?
Me.
Why?
I don't know.
Did you expect it to be abandoned?
I don't know.
Maybe an altar in your honor...
Please.
Pour the wine.
Do you prefer to cook
or do you want me to?
If you want, we can both do it.
How about we share duties
for now?
All right.
All right.
-You don't have another glass?
-No, I don't drink.
I've forbidden myself.
You can light the fireplace
if you want.
Otherwise we'll freeze
during dinner.
There's no signal in this area
because of the mountain behind us.
That's okay.
The normal phone works,
it's over there.
You can call your husband
if you want.
That's okay, maybe later.
-So he won't worry...
-Why would he?
Tell him I seem normal.
That it doesn't look like
I want to kill you.
How did you get so popular?
My husband's career
led me into that world.
Right.
And you thought that
enough time had passed.
This is impossible, the wood is wet.
For what?
For me to forget you.
How did you meet your husband?
What's his name?
Bernabé.
Bernabé.
How did you meet him?
When I left, well...
I went back to school and he came
to teach an economics class
at the university.
We went out for drinks
after with the group.
And we watched each other.
And later he took me aside
to ask me out for dinner sometime.
What does he do?
He's a businessman.
-But he was rich before that, right?
-Well,
his family.
So he chose you.
Like rich people do.
No.
He's not like that, he has values...
What about your daughter?
What does she do?
Besides training dogs.
She takes good photos.
She has a lot of followers online.
Brands pay her to upload photos
with their products.
We're sending her to the United States.
By mail?
What?
You make her sound like
a package.
Does she bother you?
She picked the school.
And who picked the country?
And you?
What?
What do you do?
I didn't...
I never finished a degree.
I didn't specialize in anything,
lousy jobs,
average relationships...
Nothing stands out.
It's not to make you feel guilty,
I just...
I'd love to have things
to be proud of, but...
there's nothing.
Personal achievements
don't always appear on a resumé.
An expert in protocol.
I almost bought it.
I don't know where the limit is
in this situation.
Don't worry.
Tonight doing the dishes is enough.
Good night.
I thought you were away
until the end of the month.
It went faster than I expected.
The restoration course went well?
It wasn't worth the trouble.
I thought it would be easier.
You know I'm too impatient
for long-term things.
Wait, don't move.
Go on.
Natasha!
Hi!
Natasha...
Come here, pretty flower!
Hi!
Hi, Natasha.
Why does she growl at me
when I serve myself alcohol?
She hates people who drink.
It's something between us.
Pretty!
Thank you.
See you soon.
You know where to find me.
Are you from around here?
It's not safe
if you don't know the way.
No. I haven't been here for ages.
Then you shouldn't go any further.
The forest is dangerous after The Rock.
The Rock?
A lot of people get lost there.
Thank you.
Come here.
Down.
Down.
Down, down.
Down.
Stay.
Stay.
Stay.
Down.
Down.
There.
Come here.
Are you okay?
Yes.
And that dog?
It's a female.
She fell in a well and I got her out.
You went down a well?
Yes.
I heard her crying for days
and I couldn't find her.
But today I did. Right, beautiful?
But how did you get down
by yourself?
With ropes.
It wasn't dangerous, it wasn't very deep.
Look, grab that hose.
Help me wash her off.
Can I change?
I'm not dressed properly.
Just turn it on and spray,
you won't get wet.
Here, it's okay.
Stay over there so you won't get wet.
Go on.
Don't be scared, it's okay.
Good, that's it.
That's it.
You were scared,
weren't you, sweetie?
Did you think nobody
would come find you?
That you were going to be
left alone in that hole?
Huh, sweetie?
Beautiful, beautiful.
Rinse my hair a bit.
That's where I have more.
It's dried.
Okay, there.
That's enough.
Let's finish rinsing her off.
Hold her.
Hold her here.
Her collar, that's it.
Okay.
That's it, good.
I told you I wanted to change.
Careful.
Not in my face.
Please!
Not in my face!
I said not in my face!
You're hurting me, damn it!
Come on, it's no big deal.
Life in the country, woman.
Come here.
Is it going to be like this
the whole time?
What?
The little games,
to see if I can take it.
Lighten up, it was a joke.
Is it because of your dress?
-I'll pay for it if you want.
-What do you mean?
It's expensive, right? Your dress.
It's a gift.
A nice gift.
From your husband?
Yes.
How much did it cost?
I don't know.
I don't ask how much a gift costs.
Right.
But I bet you calculate how much
people spend on you to see
how much they love you.
It would bother you if someone
gave you a cheap dress...
Not at all.
Right.
Hey, you.
What should we call you?
Do you like Juliet?
Like my favorite song.
Do you like Juliet?
No?
How about Natasha?
Yes.
Natasha.
Natasha. Then that's it. Natasha.
Gorgeous.
I'm going to town.
Do you need anything?
What's she like?
Actually we don't spend
much time together.
She gives me free days
and I don't even see her.
Yesterday she brought a dog she found
and made me wash it.
It lives with us now.
We named it Natasha.
I'd understand if you never
forgave me for this.
I already forgave you.
A long time ago.
How long ago?
I've known for years.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know how to handle it,
that's why I never said anything.
We can talk about it later.
Glad to see you're having fun.
I thought you were outside.
Have you got the keys?
What?
The car keys.
Yeah, sure.
I'm going out.
You look very pretty.
Where are you going?
Don't wait up for me.
Why did you give me
an Italian name?
Back then I think this actor
had a daughter...
I can't remember his name.
He always wore a suit
and sunglasses.
He was in that movie
with the tobacconist.
You know who I mean?
Well, that's what he named
his daughter.
Is it going too slow?
It's going too slow.
Anabel!
You got off while it was moving?
That's dangerous!
I always thought that ride was crap.
Just as well you liked good movies,
you could have ruined my life.
Famous names ruin many people's lives.
I thought you didn't drink.
I don't.
Just tonight, for the fair.
Are you happy? With your family?
Being popular, helping people
altruistically and all that?
So many questions!
You know me, I have that thing
where I can't concentrate.
I don't understand.
Yeah.
Attention problems, I get distracted.
All I did as a kid was climb.
You were a quiet girl.
No.
Not after.
I failed subjects.
And I lost toys on purpose.
I'd climb trees...
as high as I could and stay there.
You haven't answered me.
Are you happy?
My husband knew you existed.
For years.
And you found out today?
To Marcello Mastroianni.
I'll let you ask me a question.
Any question you want.
I promise to answer without complaining.
Does anyone else know?
Know what?
About this trip.
Like who?
I don't know.
-I'm going to dance.
-I'm sorry.
I really wanted to know
something else.
I'm sorry.
Please, let's go home!
Let go!
Who is she?
What does she want?
I don't know her.
I don't know important people.
I don't want to dance anymore.
More?
-Chiara?
-No.
I'm going to die!
No, sweetie. It's only the alcohol.
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die...
Do you want to go to bed?
No.
You came back?
Whore.
Looking for something?
I don't want to disturb you.
No, tell me.
Several years ago
my husband and I met
a man who lived here.
We heard he passed away.
He lived in a house
up there, past the forest.
Mister Mathieu?
Yes.
He isn't dead.
He lives in Paris with his wife.
He used to come often to see
his daughter who still lives in the house.
I know her.
I can take you if you want.
That's okay.
I only knew her father.
Thank you.
You made tea?
Yes.
How are you feeling?
Better, thank you.
Have you eaten anything?
A little.
Only a little?
You must be starving.
Why?
You've been sleeping
for two days.
-Isn't today Saturday?
-No, it's Sunday.
Sunday?
Damn.
Sunday afternoon.
Is something wrong?
No.
Where are you?
Here.
Come in.
Oh, a movie!
No, they're only slides, sorry.
-I thought they were extinct.
-Yes, they are.
Do you want to know why I left?
Over time I've gotten
more curious about knowing
what you were thinking when you did it.
Do you remember what you did
that day before you left?
No.
I do.
You put on make-up.
You left...
You left your make-up out.
Like you were in a hurry, on the table.
I see.
Stop for a second.
Go back one.
Another one.
How is that possible?
Because that's me,
pregnant with you.
But you're right next to me
and you're...
the same age I was there.
How is that possible?
There was a time
I experimented a lot.
No, it's wonderful.
It's like a temporal paradox.
How did you do it?
It's just a lousy cut and paste job...
No, no.
No, there's insight, perspective.
An idea, a yearning.
You tripping out.
No, no.
How old were you there?
I don't know.
Your face is made for a magazine cover.
No, that's heroine.
What do you mean?
It's heroine.
But not anymore.
Back then, I'm clean now.
It was a teenage phase.
You fall in love and he asks you
to do it for him, then later...
you can't stop and...
Anyway, that's enough temporal paradox.
I want to apologize...
No, I don't want you to apologize.
Then what do you want?
Why am I here?
I don't feel well.
What do you feel?
That the photos are coming to life.
Then let them.
I was there.
Your father and I were there.
That's not true.
We had to lie to everyone.
Nobody found out. Ever.
What was it like?
I can't explain it.
You have to live it.
I hear everything.
Anabel.
What?
Are you listening?
Of course.
A few months ago I was told that...
that things might not go well for me.
Is someone there?
Is someone there?
Chiara?
You're sick?
If you're still hallucinating
eat another lump of sugar.
It brings you back down.
That's it, isn't it?
That's why I'm here.
You need me.
I wanted you to give me a hand
with the decor.
What have you got?
Is it fatal?
You'd better go to bed.
Are you going to die?
I hope so.
Reaching 90 must totally suck.
What age do you think
is a good limit?
I don't know.
Say one.
I don't know,
whatever comes to mind.
Eighty-five.
Right. Eighty-five.
Do you want me
to take care of you?
You want me to stay a few more days,
as long as you want?
Tell me what you want me to do.
Don't get all mushy,
I feel like spitting at you.
I understand that you're angry.
You don't understand anything.
A woman who abandons
her 8-year-old daughter
doesn't understand anything.
She doesn't understand shit.
Someone who leaves her by this window
waiting for her to come back
for the rest of her life
doesn't understand anything!
I get drunk sometimes
and sit here for hours.
Hours and hours, I'm still here!
I've been here since I was
eight years old, you jerk!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Shit, it's bleeding, I'm sorry.
What should I do?
Bring something to cover
the wound.
Come over here.
Come on.
Now, when I move my hand,
put it on the wound
and press down hard, okay?
I don't want to hurt you.
Now.
Now, when the bleeding stops,
I'll need something strong
for the pain.
That I have.
What do you want to do
tomorrow?
I'm planting some seeds
I bought the other day.
Campanula.
They're flowers.
Are you going to come
and water them every weekend?
They don't need much care
in this climate.
Flowers aren't my thing.
They're strong.
They can handle hostile terrain.
You'd better go back.
Where?
To your life.
You've been perfect, really, thank you.
But that's it, it's over.
So this was the plan.
There is no plan.
Then why did you want me
to come here?
I was wrong, I'm sorry.
I've been here for a week
and I still don't know why I'm here.
I don't know what to tell you.
This got out of hand.
I'm sorry, I don't know.
Tell me what you want already.
Or is this what you wanted.
To see me like this.
Still knowing that you'll never
forgive me for what I did to you.
No, I forgave you a long time ago,
really. There's no grudge.
Then...
what do you want me to do?
Tell me already.
I want you to leave.
Please.
At the hospital
they told me everything.
Your disease, the evolution.
The pain and how long you have left.
You see? You shouldn't have
planted those flowers.
What do you want me to do?
We can have dinner.
Do you feel like it?
A barbecue?
Come on.
But I want you to be gone
tomorrow when I wake up, okay?
What do you want?
Come on, look.
We can light the fire here.
It's windy but it'll take.
This is just how it is.
There's nothing else,
this is how things are.
I only want to help you.
Are you sure you want to know
what I want from you?
Of course.
Really?
Yes.
If you decide not to do it,
I want you to leave.
Yes.
How are you?
Fine.
Why are you dressed so lightly?
I didn't know it was
the coldest day of the year here.
The climate and people in Paris
will never know how to bundle up.
Sounds familiar.
It's yours.
That's why we left
and my parents hated you.
They hated me before that, Mathieu.
You were a rebel.
How do you say it where you're from?
"Stir crazy."
That's right.
"Stir crazy."
And now?
Now...
I've stopped.
Someone like you doesn't just show up
like this after 35 years.
I went looking for you in the
cemetery and you weren't there.
I see.
I was lied to.
Apparently that's a sign of creativity.
Lying?
No.
Adding intrigue to life.
That always worked with you.
What?
Intrigue.
The need to imagine that
what you want is somewhere else.
Where?
Anywhere else but here.
Sir!
Do you hold a grudge against me?
No.
Why?
It's transformed.
Into what?
An immobile memory.
You always make up expressions
I don't understand.
Some memories move and help us live.
Others...
get blocked.
Very powerful.
If we can't set it back in motion,
it drags us down.
She asked me to...
I know.
She wouldn't let me do it.
You offered to?
Yes.
But she only invited me to dinner.
She said good night
like I was going to see her
the next day.
You didn't say goodbye?
It's better.
What's better?
Not to.
You know something about that.
I didn't do it out of cowardice.
You didn't because
you'd made up your mind.
And nothing could stop you.
Like her.
No.
I left because...
I wanted more.
And did you get more?
Yes.
But it's never enough, Mathieu.
Never.
It's exhausting.
You see?
We all deserve to rest.
Thank you. Keep the change.
Chiara?
Chiara!
What are you doing lying here?
Let's go home.
I'm tired.
I'll help you go to bed. Come on.
No.
I'm tired.
One last effort.
Can you?
Come on.
Mom...
Mom...
What, my child?
I understand.
What?
Everything.
I'm not scared.
Don't look at me.
SUNDAY'S ILLNESS
