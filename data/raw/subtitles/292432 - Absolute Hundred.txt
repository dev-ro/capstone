ABSOLUTE HUNDRED
The seller agrees
that the buyer can pass
the entry of ownership
without the presence
and consent of the seller.
ls that OK with you?
ls that OK?
Sorry, l have a cold.
-Cold?
You want some tea?
-Yes.
Here is 3.000. The rest
you'll have as agreed.
You guarantee the same
status for the members?
Have you listened
what l was saying?
lt's all there.
Get this crap out.
l want to redecorate.
Those are memories.
-Do you care?
You better take them,
l'll throw them away.
OK. Give me two,
three days.
Two, three days?
l'm not Neske.
Get out!
OK, l won't keep you
any longer.
l can't see anything
from here.
He'll shoot a bull's eye.
Don't leave,
we have a meeting.
Where's lgor?
-l haven't seen him.
Nice, you're all here.
This is Mr. Runda, new
shooting gallery's owner.
Well, what can l say...
l'm pleased to be
among Champions.
Until now marksmanship
depended on your devotion.
You didn't have
the right support.
But now l'll help you
to achieve better results.
That will demand commer-
cialization of the Gallery,
so l'm asking for
your support.
You will practice
till two p.m.
Afterwards, those
who pay.
But the most important
thing is
that membership
will stay the same.
Sasa? Wait!
Runda wants to see you.
-ln some other life.
lgor sold the Gallery,
but it's not our business.
You have a Championship
in 30 days in France
and very good chances.
-What am l supposed to do?
Crawl to your Runda?
First of all,
he's not mine.
Second, he's not to blame
for purchasing the Gallery.
Third, we have to
practice in here.
You're right.
See you tomorrow.
What's this?
You want installments?
You think l'm a jerk!
You'll have the rest soon.
-ln a few months, junkie!
You're not aware that
you're in deep shit.
Take this painting.
-lf l wanted a painting,
l would go to a Museum.
-Our famous artist.
How much is this shit worth?
-10.000 DEM at least.
Fuck, we don't need it.
-Two grand.
You're fucked if you
don't give me the money.
l can't give it for two...
You fucker! There's no
bargaining with us!
How much is your brother
worth to you?
Leave him alone.
-What?
You and your brother
are fucked! -OK!
You'll have your money
tomorrow, leave him alone.
How much is this shit worth?
-lt's worthless. -Leave it.
See you around.
lgor!
Open the door!
Do you hear me?
Open the door!
OK, calm down!
-Open the door!
What is it? -What?
-l couldn't come, l'm sorry.
That's not what
l'm talking about.
You promised me
you'll never sell it.
You should have told me.
-l had to sell it...
Besides, it's my problem.
ls that clear?
We have more expenditure
than profit.
lt's the only thing
father left us.
And because of it
we should both drop dead?
Where are you going?
Shall we go to the movies?
Just the two of us.
l can't.
ls there something
wrong with me?
You'll have to finish it,
it's after two. -So what?
Please! That's the deal,
at least for now.
Just let me finish
the training session.
Better see Runda, he'll
give you better conditions.
But you must show
some good will.
They say you'll be
better than your brother.
Fuck, l wasn't fortunate
in sports.
l've tried boxing, handball.
People like team sport.
l'm boring you?
You didn't like
my speech yesterday?
Brother didn't tell him
he have sold the Gallery.
He didn't tell you?
-Sasa... -Hey!
He can speak for himself.
There is only one problem.
-Yes? -The schedule.
l told you. Sasa's National
Champion in Junior league.
l know. -He's preparing
for the World Championship.
So?
-He must practice more.
Of course. 90, 95%of
success is in practice.
We'll think of something.
No, you stay. Look...
l'm glad that a Champion
is practicing in my gallery.
Tonight l'm opening new
joint. You're my guest.
Why are you fucking
with me? -What?
lf l said till two, it's two
not 10 minutes later.
For every hour you'll give
me 10 DEM. -How come?
Like that. -You said you'll
give him better conditions..
l meant sneakers,
sweat suit, rifle...
But he can practice till
two. -He uses one line.
You're not making the rules.
The Gallery is mine.
Sanja!
Why are you yelling?
-Come down. -OK.
Whole day long l'm
thinking about last night.
What's the matter
with you?
l have to pull the words
out of your mouth.
We're invited to a party.
Tonight.
You brought us to
a betting joint!
Your Runda is a redneck.
Yes, he is.
Why are you so pissed?
-Shut up.
Why don't we go in?
-Are you nuts?
Free drinks, man.
-No.
Please, 15 minutes only.
You are my dearest guest
tonight. You know why?
There are Ministers, cops,
position, opposition.
But you are the
only champion.
They don't worth a dime.
-Let's go.
Easy, sister.
Let's have another drink.
Vodka-juice
and three whiskeys.
l've watched you today.
You're fantastic.
l would like you
to teach me something.
OK, but it's not free.
As your shooting hours.
Don't get mad, champion.
lt's not my fault
that your junkie brother
sold the gallery.
l need some fresh air.
-Wait!
l'll go and check Sanja.
Fuck, l only wanted
to help. l paid for it.
What's the matter with you?
You're making a scene. -What?
He must show respect
to the man. -What man?
C'mon.
Listen, champion.
This is not for public eyes.
Hold it!
What, you don't have a gun?
-l know nothing about it.
lf you like it
you can have it.
You and l have something
in common.
We are both big
in our line of work.
That's why we understand
each other.
You said you need more
time to practice.
No problem.
lf it was somebody else,
l would've kicked his ass.
But, l have a proposal
for you.
l don't care for the Gallery
l'll get rid of it soon.
Coach drinks, kids shoot
all day long...
lt gets on my nerves.
You'll have the key to
practice whenever you want.
You can teach my guys,
l don't have the time.
lf someone special shows
up, you'll be there.
One more thing.
Your brother...
l don't want him there.
Do we have a deal?
No.
lt that so?
-Yes.
You don't love me anymore.
-You know l do.
l don't...
Fuck, when it's something
important you're silent.
l didn't expect you'd
say something anyway.
Kid...
Tell you brother he's got
till Wednesday evening.
And tell him
not to fuck around!
ls that clear? Go.
lgor!
Fuck!
You're alive? Are you?!
You could've fried yourself!
Come on, easy.
Here you are...
-Thank you.
Look at those Chinese,
bro...
What a place.
What is it?
-They are waiting for you.
Hi Neske.
l'm Sasa,
lgor's brother. -l know.
My buddy and l came
for a drink,
but l saw you and wanted
to say hello. -Cool.
l want to have a word
with you. -Yes?
lt's about lgor. l want
to help him, but...
lt's not working. But you
are helping him. -Yes.
Well l don't like the way
you're helping him. -Why?
You should know.
Your brother have chosen
very expensive sport. -What?
What do you want, fucker?
-lt's OK.
You made him go to war
then to become a junkie.
Now you're rolling in money.
You even took his girl
so you can piss him off
because he was always better.
You would be happier
if he was killed.
Finish your drink and go.
l was shit-scared! l thought
he'd kill us on the spot.
lt's OK.
-What is OK?
Like you don't know
how dangerous he is.
You motherfucker!
lt was red light.
-l know, bro!
You can't go in.
-l have to practice.
Boss says no!
Don't fuck with me!
Fuck you!
Beat it, or you're dead!
Hey!
This is not Hollywood.
Let him go.
What's the problem?
-l came to practice.
So?
This is our time. -He told
you, no practice today.
l'm with my friends.
And l'm the boss, son.
l decide when
you can practice.
This is not your junkie
brother's gallery.
Leave him alone!
Now you are impertinent
and l wanted to help.
You won't become a champion
behaving like that.
Like you know.
lf you haven't shown today
you would be fucked!
We'll finish...
-You shut up!
l'm postponing paint job
because of a junkie.
You could've given me
those two grand.
ls that so? This way
is much faster.
Fuck you, you fat pussy!
-Put it away!
Fat pussy! You
fucking junkie!
You have any wise
cracks now?
You're crazy!
You'll kill him! -Let go.
Get yourself together!
l'll fuck you...
Where do you think
you're going? -Let go!
Where do you think you're
going? -Motherfucker!
Get out!
You motherfucker!
-Stop it!
Get out! Out!
Look how he's shaking.
Crisis?
Would you like to shake
in a joint?
A murder was committed
last night. -With a sniper.
Quite elegant.
-Poor man...
But l don't know who was
killed. Someone l know?
You think we are idiots?
That you can fuck with us?
You killed Runda, admit it.
-You're not the only suspect.
Look at him!
-You had a motive.
Many had stronger ones...
-Don't fuck with us!
You killed Runda,
admit it!
Admit it! Didn't you?
Didn't you?!
No.
-No?
C'mon!
-Calm down!
What's the matter with you?
Calm down.
You're wrong.
l didn't kill him.
OK, we'll check out.
You can go.
Did you hear him?
-Yes.
The one that killed
Runda last night
can kill anyone from
God knows what distance.
Straight in the center.
All shooters can do it.
So all sport shooters are
suspects, not only lgor?
l want to talk with
all of them.
Will tomorrow my neighbor
Ruza be a suspect?
Don't.
l think Runda was killed
by his own Mafia.
These shooters are kids
and poor shooters...
Since lgor left
marksmanship...
You were good also.
l don't have the patience.
The kid, Gordic?
-He has a future.
Call him over.
-Why?
To talk.
lgor's friend is here, a cop.
Want's to talk to you.
Gordic kid. l know you
since you were a kid.
You know what happened?
Then you know we
talked to lgor? -l know.
He's the only suspect.
With a poor alibi.
We know the guy who
claims he was with him.
Junkies! -lgor didn't
kill him. -l hope so.
Where were you last night,
between midnight and one?
At home, in bed.
-What if you're lying?
l never lie.
OK.
You can go back
to your practice.
Fridge is full.
-l went shopping.
Where did you get the money?
Where did you get the money?
You have two kinds of
oranges in California.
Valencia, great for juice.
The other one...
l don't know the name,
but it's better for eating.
What have you sold now?
-Nothing, relax.
You were practicing?
-Yes. -You are good?
l have qualifications
for World Championship.
That's great.
Just keep practicing.
Wake me up tomorrow at noon,
don't forget!
Listen, l have only a grand.
Man stud me up.
Tomorrow you'll have the
rest. Runda's brother...
Relax, our friendship
worth's more than a grand.
What friendship?
-Tomorrow is our anniversary.
l want to buy Jelena
something special.
What do you think
she would like?
Rubies, diamonds... though
emeralds are the best.
C'mon, you know
what she likes.
Not funny.
C'mon, l'm taking you
somewhere.
You see that window?
-Which one?
Where Maria used to live.
-Maria?
Maria was OK.
Shy a little but OK.
l worked on her a lot
but you fucked up.
You fucked her but she
thought it was serious.
She wanted just a fuck.
-She wanted to be loved.
Misunderstanding.
-She was everything to me.
She wasn't only a fuck.
-You wanted to marry her?
You're really something.
Always playing cool.
But then now you would
be in my place.
Everyone thought that l'm
a failure and you're cool.
Maybe l'm not a bad ass
but l'm myself.
So am l.
-Hell you are.
You used to smoke
''Drina'' without filter.
l used to buy them
for you. -Good stuff.
l smoke ''Davidoff''.
lf you forgot,
tobacco shop is
around the corner.
Go and get me some.
-No way.
lf you go, you don't
have to pay me 1 grand.
And you can even
keep the change.
l said you can
keep the change.
Relax.
Take is easy.
Are you sleeping at all?
Qualifications are tomorrow.
You're acting like a baby!
l'm waiting for 2 hours.
-Where are you going?
l'm late for work.
l wanted to call you...
-l want to talk to you.
You have a problem
and l have a problem.
And standing all day...
-Why didn't you came in?
First l have to learn
to walk through the walls.
Listen, we know each other.
l have the right to know
what's going on.
You think l don't know
that you are in trouble?
lt's obvious. Or l'm not
worthy of your trust?
Do l mean anything
to you at all?
Say something! Fuck!
l'll call you.

-No.

A small gift.
Come on in.
Go to your room,
we have to talk.
Everything is the same
like when we were kids.
Yes.
l'm sorry, l was
out of line yesterday.
Get some ice.
lt's nice to sit and chat
with old friend.
You can't trust anyone
these days.
Yep.
You're in a bad mood?
-Surprised by your visit.
Why? l've missed
my old pal.
Our encounters lately
weren't that joyful.
Everyone knows you owe
me money. l can't be nice.
That's why l wanted
to talk to you.
Great. We talked.
Now drink up and go.
You have a crisis?
-l've changed my mind.
Leave now, l don't
want to look at you.
Same motherfucker!
''Lend me some money!''
''Give me the keys from
your place!''
You're complaining because
l've stolen your girl.
You've stolen 20 chicks from
me that meant nothing to you.
l love Jelena. Who do you
love? -You're pathetic.
Look at you. Junkie,
just the dope matters.
l have to make a phone
call... -No you don't.
Here.
l don't have the money.
-You don't need it.
Thanks.
-Wait.
Where is your endurance?
Listen.
l need a pusher that l can
trust. You know people.
Want me to be your
pusher? -Yes.
Why are you better than us?
Acting like you're special.
Look at yourself.
-You'll have it tomorrow.
You don't have the money.
-l'll get it.
You don't have it.
-l'll get it! -Where?
Even if you sell your
entire past and this shit,
you still won't have enough.
You got hooked very fast.
After all, you're the best
in everything you do.
Get out!
What is it, kid?
-Get out!
You're crazier than
your brother.
Give me a call.
l'm coming!
Oh, it's you.
l'm making pasta.
-lgor is feeling down.
Can you talk to him?
-Yes. -Come by tonight.
Say you TV is broken.
-Well, it is.
You sure you're not hungry?
-No. l'm in a hurry.
Wild duck says
to a painter:
l need a paint job...
-l'm going for a walk.
The Olympics, bro...
l was ready to go to
Montreal in 1976
but they send
the Macedonian.
lt was the rule that two
from Serbia couldn't go.
Judge bore a hole
in his target.
l smashed their skulls.
And l fucked...
Yourself. You were
disqualified, l know.
Sorry.
-lt's OK.
Why did you came by?
Your TV is really broken?
Sasa asked me to me come
and talk to you.
He said you're not OK.
-Nonsense.
Please don't tell him.
He loves you, man!
OK?
-OK.
l have to get dressed,
l'm sorry. -No problem.
l have a date in town.
We're going?
-We're going.
Let's go. -You're nuts?
-l have to go!
What's with you?
-l'm not feeling well.
Now you made me leave!
l didn't get her number.
Are you OK?
-l'm cool.
l worked on her all evening.
-You could've stayed.
What's wrong with you?
You fucked me big.
Are we the best buddies?
-We are, but this sucked.
Can you keep this for
a few days? -What's this?
You know lgor,
he can sell it.
OK.
lf anyone asks, l was
with you the whole evening.
All right?
l get it. Sanja?
Good morning, neighbor!
What is it now?
Whom have l killed now?
Give me the rifle! -What?
-Search the place!
Don't fuck with me,
where is the rifle?
l sold it. -To whom?
-A friend. -Name! -Neske.
Your hands!
You! Come here.
Now you're really fucked.
Take him away.
Where were you last night?
-With a friend, at a party.
Are you sure?
l'm sure.
Oh yes, you never lie.
We haven't found a thing.
Get dressed, you're
coming with us. -Nothing.
You said you were there
around eleven thirty?
And stayed till...?
-Three thirty.
You were together the
whole time? -l think...
Don't think!
Don't think!
We were not together
the whole time.
Where was Sasa?
-At the party.
But you said you were
not together... -He's lying.
l think...
-Don't think.
l was talking to a girl.
Sasa was mingling.
-Don't lie.
Why would l lie?
-Don't lie!
Can someone back up
your story?
Everyone at the party.
-Everyone?
People who know him.
-Listen.
lf you are lying,
your fucked. Understand?
You're fucked!
Go clean yourself.
You can go.
Your friend confirmed
your story.
Sit down.
Now you can go.
Sit down.
l have a stomach ache.
We just received your
approval for France.
Our Association will pay
all the expenses.
We have to send your
passport, for visa.
There is one more thing.
lt's not good news.
We have a new owner.
Nice man.
He'll allow us to practice
till you're here.
Then he'll turn this
into a pool room.
lt doesn't pay off to
keep a shooting gallery.
Money is in poker strips.
-Where will we go?
You'll go to another team,
everyone wants you.
Don't worry about me.
Third thing... lgor.
We watched the game
and l left around midnight.
He then went to see a girl.
She confirmed it.
lgor's not a killer.
-l know, they let him go.
He called 15 minutes ago,
want's to get some sleep.
Now go to your practice.
Hi.
Excuse me for a moment.
Tomorrow is my birthday.
-l know.
Why didn't you call me?
-lgor was in jail.
Shall l see you?
l have to go back,
but l'll call you.
These walls are terrible,
pure concrete.
What happened downtown?
-Girl said l was with her.
l'll get it.
What is it?
Didn't expect us?
What do you want now?
Make us a coffee, kid.
-Sit down!
You thought, Neske's dead
and you're off the hook?
l paid my debt. -Lie!
You still owe some money.
l had a deal with Neske.
-What deal? Motherfucker!
Your deal died with him.
Now you owe us. Understand!
Don't touch my medal!
-Shut up, kid.
l know this is worthless,
but l could appreciate it.
You'll take it just
to humiliate me.
Fuck you! l don't
give a shit for you.
One junkie more or less.
-OK, you're upset.
Next time will be the last.
One week!
You'll give me the money
or both of you will join
Neske. Get it?
Don't you dare to sell
the medal. -l won't.
You said that for the
gallery. -Medal is mine!
l can do with it as
l please! So shut up.
l can't... -What?
-l can't take it! -What?
You selling our stuff
and stoned all the time!
They pushing us around!
You were something,
now you are a prick!
l can't look at you.
Shall we play?
-No.
Let's have a joint.
Since when do you puff?
lt seems l'm going
to the Championship.
Notification came
from the Association.
Congratulations.
The morning after
the police picked me...
l came home and
opened the sack.
l lied to the cops.
l've realized that
later on.
l know.
You juked me.
l know everything.
-What do you know?
l'm totally fucked up.
l can't have it
in my place. Sorry.
Maybe l'm a... wuss.
You'll give me the sack.
Be calm, like there's
nothing around you.
You don't hear a thing.
Then you are focused.
Your father was ice cold.
lgor was a born shooter.
And you inherited
their best.
Happy birthday.
-You didn't forget.
Of course not.
l drank mine.
-So have l.
l heard a good joke
last night...
Shall we have some more?
-Yep. Beer.
Cvika? -Why me?
-Go get some beer.
Please, it's my birthday.
-l'll buy some chips too.
l'm drunk.
-l'm dead drunk.
Look!
Hey...
l've missed you.
And?
l've missed you a lot.
What's the matter with him?
-Overdose.
Breath!
Wake up!
Wake up, motherfucker!
l'll get salt and water!
Where's the salt?
-lgor! -Where is it?
Wake up, motherfucker!
Fuck you! Wake up!

Easy, easy...
Are you OK?

You sold it, idiot!
Calm down! Fuck the medal,

You're drunk!
Where are you going?
Sasa! -Go home.

Open the door, Sasa!
Open the door!
You can't drive,

Let's go back. Please!
-Go home.
Go home, l said!

Get out!
-No!
lgor is OK.
-What do you want?
Get out!
-No! We're going with you!
Don't yell!
l'm going with you. -No.
-Where are you going?
l won't be long.
Where did he go?
What's with him?
He's totally crazy.
You're his friend,
you should go with him.
But you don't give a fuck.
Maybe something
happened to him?
What's the matter with you?
Say something.
He's not back yet.
Something's wrong.
lt's fucking freezing
outside.
l'm shot, bro!
Where? -On the roof!
-l can't see him!
Motherfucker!
Did you hear that?
What?
-Shots fired.
You motherfucker!
Where is that jerk!
Get down!
Motherfucker!
Sale...
-What?
Stop the car.
Stop the car!
Fuck! Let me see!
Hold this. lt's not bad.
We must get her to the
hospital. -Shut up!
You'll be OK.
You hear?
l think l better go home.
-Go. -What do you mean?
Go! Go home!
Now! -l'll go...
That will be the best.
Can you make it?
We'll fix it.
What happened?
l'll call the ambulance.
Don't!
Doctor will be here
in 10 minutes.
Friend of mine.
Where's the sniper?
Answer me! Your
silence is killing you.
How can you take the law
into your hands?! ldiot!
Where did you get
this crazy idea?!
Someone has to.
-What?! lt won't be you!
l went to war and
paid for both of us!
Yes! And you became
a junkie and a wuss!
You fucked yourself
and everything around you.
So cut the crap! -Don't
you talk to me like that!
l will! You let yourself
be humiliated!
They took our medal!
-Medal is mine! -No!
OK. l'm a junkie.
And a wuss.
Because l couldn't forget
the faces of people
who were not aware that
l'll blow their brains out.
Every time it gets easier
to pull the trigger.
You're doing it without
thinking about it.
You're trying not to
see their faces.
You look at their legs...
Stomach, ears.
But in the end...
all you can see
are their faces and eyes.
And think you'll forget it
in time. You can't.
When l came back...
l went to the shooting
gallery.
Dressed up, took my
rifle, position...
Aimed.
But l saw faces
of all those people
going before me
very, very fast.
Then l realized that
sport is dead for me.
Rifle represents only death.
l'm a wuss, l admit it.
Where's the sniper?
-ln the basement.
Hello. This is
the vehicle
tracked down upon
citizen's report.
We know the owner?
-Gordic lgor, J.G. 120.
You find a weapon? -Just
fingerprints and blood.
One point for me.
Call special unit.
Bye, guys.
You must act like
everything is normal.
Have breakfast, go to
practice and then to town.
Like nothing happened.
OK?
OK.
Go.
Now?
-Now.
Go on! l'll see you
later.
All clear!
lt's open!
Don't move!
-Put the gun down!
That many people got up
this early because of me!
Don't fuck with me!
Put the gun down!
l'm not fucking around.
Maybe it wasn't you.
Don't make any more trouble!
No! Don't!
Your brother was a great
guy, until he took the...
You should be
proud of him.
Listen...
You're smart,
you'll be a champion.
Maybe even bigger
than your brother was.
He would've want that.
-l know.
Can l go now?
-Wait!
lf you continue with it...
lgor killed himself
for nothing.
You owe your brother
a lot.
Don't worry for those two...
They won't bother you.
lgor Gordic gave us gold.
