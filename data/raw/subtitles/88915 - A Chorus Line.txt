- No.
- Don’t dance.
Don’t dance!
Let’s go.
God got out
the wrong side of the bed.
I hate his auditions.
We’re being treated like worms.
He’s a shit,
but goddamned talented.
The boy in the headband, head up!
Headband, head up!
How long will he keep us?
My job starts at four.
Call in sick.

God, I really blew it
How could I do a thing like that?
Now I"II never make it
He doesn’t like my looks
He doesn’t like the way I dance
The blonde in the front:
Much better, but still too tense.
I know there’s an audition,
but can I see the director?
Leave him a note.

Didn’t you use to be a dancer?
I saw you here.
You stopped the show.
I was in highschool.
I’m sorry,
I didn’t mean to say it that way.
- I"II get this to Zach right away.
- Thanks.
My God, I don’t believe it.
Did anybody know you were coming?
No, I just came from the airport.
Zach... Look who’s here.
Hi, Cassie.
- Sorry to bust in on you like this.
- No, it’s good to see you.
We’re running late.
- It’s important that I see you.
- Leave your number with Larry.
- Hang on till the first break...
- Larry, let’s go.
The last group of guys.
Fine... just bring it down a bit.

I knew he liked me
I knew he liked me
We’ve got a lot to do
before the next elimination.
Give your pictures
and resumés to Larry. Thank you.
What’s coming next?
What’s coming now?
God, I hope I get it
I’ve come this far,
but it could be yes or no
My unemployment is gone
I thought I had it from the start
I’ve got to get this show!
Larry, would you collect them?
Kim, pick them up, please.
Who am I anyway?
Am I my resumé?
That is a picture
of a person I don’t know
What does he want from me?
What should I try to be?
So many faces all around
and here we go
I need this job
Oh, God, I need this show.
Zach...
- We’re running late, Cassie.
- I’m here to audition.
- There’s nothing but the chorus.
- Okay, fine.
Cassie, come on.
Okay, Larry, line them up.
Tell me your name, stage name,
where you were born, your age.
Cassie...
First, please.
Cass...
What’s all this about the chorus?
- Is Tina Mason still on 85th?
- I haven’t seen her for years.
I’d like to make a call

- What made you start dancing?
- Who knows?
Puerto Ricans jump around a lot.
If you want to know if I can act,
give me a scene. I"II act.
But I can't just talk.
- Please, I’m too nervous.
- You want the job, don’t you?
Of course.
Back in line.
Before we do any more dancing, -
- let me explain that this
will not be like other auditions.
I’m looking for a strong chorus,
people who can work together.
I’m going to try to shake you up,
see who you really are.
We’ve got some small but important
parts for people in the chorus.
I need great dancers, so I can’t
expect you all to be great actors.
So I don’t want anybody
to try to act. Understand?
Just be who you are. That’s just
as important as how you dance.
I’m going to ask you some questions.
I want to know details about you.
Things you’re proud of,
things you’re ashamed of.
If anybody can’t handle it
and wants to leave, -
- now is the time.
Honey...
Could we please go?
We’re going to be fine.
We’re Puerto Ricans. To them,
we’re ashamed of everything.
If I could think of anything I’d be
ashamed of, I’d have tried it.
Look, Zach...
I just need a minute.
- How many jobs are there?
- Four and four.
44?
- Four boys, four girls.
- Any women?
Dick,
I’m going to need a spotlight.
Zach said he'll call you
as soon as he can.
And he told me to ask you
in a nice way...
...would you mind leaving?
Shit!
- Taxi!
- Cassie!
Are you all right?
- Are you okay?
- I’m fine.
- Okay, Michael. You start.
- Me? Why not start at the end?
- What would you like to tell me?
- To start at the end.
- Wait in the musicians" room.
- He told me to leave.
- Shut up. Are you all right?
- Fine.
- I"II get some ice for your elbow.
- I feel terrible.
- What made you start dancing?
- My sister. She was a girl.
So she got all the dancing lessons.
Once in a while she took me along.
- How old were you?
- Four. I’d sit there and...
I’m watching sis go pitapat
I said, "I can do that"
"I can do that"
Knew every step right off the bat
I can do that
I can do that
One morning sis won’t go
to dance class
I grabbed her shoes, tights and all
but my foot’s too small
I stuffed her shoes
with extra socks
Ran seven blocks in nothing flat
I can do that
That I can do
Give me some room!
All thanks to sis,
I can do that.
Have you got any ice
for my ego?
You know what Zach’s like
when he’s working...
What are you talking to me
like I’m a grown-up for?
Just stay put,
and keep that ice on your elbow.
- Does Zach still think I...
- Let’s get one thing straight.
You can stay with me, but I’m not
getting between you and Zach.
I don’t know how I turned out
this heavenly.
- Are you going to do a routine?
- No, moving right along.
Start with your family.
Do you want to know the wonderful
things, or do you want the truth?
I"II take the truth.
My mother was one of the foremost
bridge cheaters in America.
My father worked for a big
corporation. He was away a lot...
...to drink.
But they were okay.
- I was the strange one.
- How strange?
Real, real strange.
Bizarre.
As I got older,
I got stranger and stranger.
I started breaking in.
I didn’t steal anything,
I just rearranged.
I went to an expensive private
school for the exceptionally stupid.
Jock City. I always got slammed
into lockers.
Not only by the students,
by the teachers, too.
I couldn’t catch a ball. And my father
was a big ex-football hero.
He was so humiliated
that he told his friends I had polio.
On Father’s Day
I used to limp for him.
And I was always thinking up
spectacular ways of killing myself.
But I realized, to commit suicide
in Buffalo is redundant.
- Exactly what you don’t want, right?
- Exactly.
Dick! Give me the spotlight.
To the left. A little more. Hold it.
Sheila.
Is there anything you want to tell me?
What do I want to be
when I grow up?
Young.
Don’t you have any softer light?
Come closer.
- Can I sit on your lap?
- Do you always come on like this?
No. Sometimes I’m aggressive.
- Tell me about your parents.
- My parents?
About your mother.
My poor, sweet, darling old mother.
She was raised in an orphanage.
They wouldn’t let her go out...
God damn it! Can’t anybody up there
hear me? Just let your hair down!
Can’t you talk? Just talk!
To me, to each other.
Jesus Christ!
Better?
Your mother...
- She was middle-aged and frumpy.
- Whose isn’t?
She was at fourteen.
Is that the kind of woman
your father liked?
He liked them young, tall,
and filled out in the right places.
Anyway... God knows why,
they had this daughter: Me.
To get away from her frumpy life,
she took me to every ballet.
Probably because it was cheaper
than a baby-sitter.
That’s when I saw that movie.
"The Red Shoes".
- It changed my whole life.
- I saw it 112 times.
I swear.
- Go on, Sheila.
- Let’s face it.
My family scene was not good.
Daddy thought he married
beneath him, that’s what he said
When proposing he told my mother
he was probably her last chance
Though she was 22
Though she was 22
She married him
Life with my dad wasn’t a picnic,
more like a come-as-you-are
When I was five I remember
Mother dug earrings out of the car
They weren’t hers
but it wasn’t discussed
He wasn’t warm
Not to her
Not to us
But everything was beautiful
at the ballet
GracefuI men litf
lovely girls in white
Yes, everything was beautiful
at the ballet
I was happy at the ballet
That’s when I started ballet class.
Up a steep and very narrow stairway
to the voice like a metronome
Up a steep and narrow stairway
It wasn’t paradise
No, it wasn’t paradise
but it was home
Mother said I’d be attractive
when I grew up
"Different," she said,
"with a special something"
"And a very personal flair"
And though I was eight or nine
though I was eight or nine
I hated her
Different is nice, but not pretty,
pretty is what it’s about
Everyone I met who was different
could figure that out
So beautiful
I’d never live to see
But it was clear
If not to her
then to me
That everyone is beautiful
at the ballet
Every prince
has got to have his swan
Yes, everyone is beautiful
at the ballet
I was pretty at the ballet.
I was born to save their marriage.
But when my father
came to the hospital, -
- he said, "I thought this was going
to help, but I guess not. "
A few months later he left
and never came back.
I had this incredible fantasy life.
I danced around like this...
In my fantasy there was
this Indian chief.
He’d say to me,
"Maggie, do you want to dance?"
And I’d say,
"Daddy, I would love to dance. "
Yes, everything was beautiful
at the ballet
Raise your arms
and someone’s always there
Yes, everything was beautiful
at the ballet
The ballet
The ballet
Yes, everything was beautiful
at the ballet
I was pretty
I was happy
I would love to
At the ballet.
Give me the resumé
of the blonde in the two-piece.
Bebe Benson.
Can we smoke?
Can the adults please smoke?
- No breaks, Sheila.
- Can I discuss that with my kidneys?
- Fine.
- Thank you.
- Kristine.
- Me?
- I don’t know where to begin.
- Tell him how you started dancing.
Well, it was when this man
came around to my home selling...
- Lessons.
- Yeah...
Dancing lessons.
And ever since then -
- I watched everything on TV that
had dancing on it. Especially...
Oh, God, what do you call "em?
Variety shows.
- What was I talking about?
- Specials.
- No, I wasn’t... it was...
- Specials.
Right, specials. Oh, God.
I’m sorry, I’m really nervous.
- Pull yourself together.
- Zach? This is together.
Robbie, there’s a suitcase
over there somewhere.
Sheila, get your ass
up on the stage.
Why is it only my ass
that gets invited?
Costumes are in there.
Hats should be in this one.
Go to the prop room on the third
floor and stay out of sight.
I know I’m putting you in a spot,
but I really need a job.
I"II talk to Zach, but you’ve got to
stay put. No more interruptions.
- Promise? Say "I promise".
- Promise.
I’m straight. I’m not too bright,
but I’m not too dumb.
And I’m not too talented.
But you show me what to do,
I"II do it eight shows a week.
Can I go next? I don’t really have
anything to say, -
- but the waiting is killing me.
Okay...
Start with your childhood.
- Terrible, like everybody else’s.
- All of it?
None of it, but who wants to admit
to a happy childhood?
- How about sex?
- Sex?
Oh, sex!
Now that was really terrible.
How?
I was twelve years old
and I didn’t know much about it.
So I took out this book with pictures
of the male and female anatomy.
I thought it was pretty interesting.
I read that book a lot.
Were you interested in medicine?
Or were you just into the pictures?
- Hello, twelve
- Hello, thirteen
Hello, love
After my first wet dream,
I looked it up in the medical book.
"Milky discharge... "
Oh, my God! Gonorrhea!
- Changes all
- Down below
Up above
I was in shock.
I didn’t have anybody to talk to.
So I told the priest I had
gonorrhea. Was he in shock!
Who have you been with, my son
Nobody
Then how can you have gonorrhea?
Finally I told him about the book,
and he set me straight.
It’s the only time
the church ever helped me.
- Time to doubt
- To break out
It’s a mess
Sex is the only subject I can speak of
without any authority whatsoever.
Too young to take over
Too old to ignore
Finally I got a girl
who was willing.
There I am, making out in the
backseat with Sally Ketchum.
A little of this, a little of that...
Very little of that.
After about an hour she said,
"Don’t you want to do anything else?"
I suddenly thought to myself,
"No, I don’t. "
Did this come as a big surprise?
I guess. It was the moment
I realized I was gay.
Hello, twelve
Hello, thirteen
Hello, love
My first time was with a girl
called Paulette.
We did it in a graveyard.
First time we made love
it was a great deal
I was too scared to feel,
nervous from trying
Next time we made love
still we were not a hit
I thought, if this is it
everyone’s Lying
Then we did it again
And I forgot to be scared
"Cause when we did it again"
I closed my eyes
Surprise
Surprise
Sweet, icicle hot,
sweet as a lemon pie
Sailing across the sky,
into the ocean
We liked it a lot
you can imagine why
We had begun to fly,
feelings in motion
And then we did it again
Was it beginner’s luck?
Or is it wonderful
once in each three tries?
Surprise
First time
Love
Again
So I closed my eyes.
Would you like to stay
twelve years old all your life?
My last show, I played a 23-year-old.
I was 23.
- The Year of the Chicken?
- Cut...
Didn’t you go to the
School of Performing Arts?
- I thought you looked familiar.
- Remember our acting teacher?
"In order to be a real actor,
it’s not enough to act like a king. "
"You also got to act like a throne. "
Tell me about it, Morales.
On the first day, Mr. Karp put us
with our legs around each other.
Then he says, "Now improvise. "
"You’re on a bobsled.
It’s snowing. "
"And it’s cold. Go. "
Every day for a week
we tried to feel the motion
Feel the motion down the hill
Every day for a week
we tried to hear the wind
Hear the wind rush, feel the chill
I dug to the bottom of my soul
to see what I had inside
Yes, I dug down to my soul
And I tried
Everybody’s going, "Whoosh!
I feel the snow, I feel the cold. "
"I feel the air. "
Mr. Karp says to me:
"What did you feel, Morales?"
And I said:
Nothing, I’m feeling nothing
He said, "Nothing
could get a girl transferred"
They all felt something,
but I felt nothing
Except feeling that this bullshit
was absurd.
I thought, "Don’t worry,
it’s only the first week. "
"Maybe it’s genetic. "
They don’t have sleds in San Juan.
Second week we had to be
a table, be a sports car
icecream cone
Mr. Karp said,
"Very good, except Morales"
"Try, Morales, all alone"
So I dug down into my soul
to see how an icecream felt
I dug down to the bottom of my soul
and I tried to melt
And the kids yelled "Nothing"
they called me "nothing"
And Karp allowed it,
which really made me burn
They were so helpful
they called me hopeless
Until I didn’t know
where else to turn
Mr. Karp comes up to me and says,
"You know what?"
"Try the Girls" High. "
"You'll never be an actress. "
Jesus Christ.
Went to church, praying,
"Santa Maria, send me guidance"
On my knees
I was praying, "Santa Maria,
help me feel it, help me feel it"
"Pretty please"
A voice came from the bottom
of my soul to the top of my head
A voice came from the bottom
of my soul
Here is what it said
"This man is nothing,
this course is nothing"
"If you want something,
go find a better class"
"And when you find one
you'll be an actress"
And I assure you
that’s what came to pass
Six months later I heard
that Karp had died
So I dug way down
to the bottom of my soul
And cried
"Cause I felt... nothing.
Okay, Don.
I’ve been listening to these people,
but let’s be honest, -
- here today, gone tomorrow.
Take this married couple...
Every time I tell my wife
I’m going to audition...
She’s got a right to... you know...
I’m a good waiter. Got two kids,
a wife, a mother on social security.
So my daytime job...
I’m a waiter, that’s what I am.
On applications it says "occupation",
I put "dancer".
I always get fired from waiter jobs.
One time late, sure,
but auditions, never.
One of my kids... like my wife
says... But on applications?
Tuesday, Wednesday.
Summer, winter. I mean, Jesus...
I’ve got the sweetest little wife
in the world, but...
I don’t know.
Before madam makes a big deal
out of it, -
- Cassie is waiting in the prop room
until the rain stops.
I don’t think she’s been working much.
- Is that it? She needs money?
- I don’t know, talk to her.
Val?
- Larry, is the loading door closed?
- I"II get it.
- Go ahead, Val. I’m sorry.
- Let’s get one thing straight.
I never saw "The Red Shoes".
I don’t give a shit about it.
I came to New York to become
a Rockette at Radio City.
This girl in my home town,
Betty Lou Heiner, -
- she made it in New York.
She was a Rockette.
She came home for Christmas,
and they gave her a parade.
A goddamn parade.
I had to twirl a frigging baton
in the pouring rain for two hours.
Unfortunately, she got knocked up
over Christmas. Merry Christmas...
My plan was to be a Rockette.
But the problem was, I was so ugly
you wouldn’t believe it.
Homely, skinny, -
- flat as a pancake.
But there I was.
I got off the bus in my white tights,
little white dress, -
- my little white shoes.
I looked like a fucking nurse.
Six months later I auditioned at
Radio City. What did the man say?
He didn’t like my fan kicks.
I can do terrific fan kicks!
So I said, "Screw you, Radio City.
I’m going to make it on Broadway. "
Every audition I danced rings
around the other girls -
- and wound up with the rejects.
Until one day, after an audition,
I swiped my dance card.
On a scale of one to ten
they gave me 10 for the dance, -
- but for looks: 3.
Dance: 10, looks: 3
and still on unemployment
Dancing for my own enjoyment,
that aunt it, kid
Dance: 10, looks: 3
is like to die
Left the theater, called the doctor
for my appointment to buy
Tits and ass
bought myself a fancy pair
Tightened up the derriere
did the nose, all that goes with it
Tits and ass,
had the bingo-bongos done
Suddenly I’m getting national tours
Tits and ass
won’t get you jobs
unless they’re yours
Didn’t cost a fortune neither
didn’t ruin my sex life either
Flat and sassy
I’d get the strays and losers
Beggars can’t be choosers,
that aunt it, kid
Fixed that chassis:
"How do you do?"
Life turned into an endless medley
of "Gee, it had to be you"
Tits and ass
Where the cupboard once was bare
now you knock, someone’s there
You’ve got "em, top to bottom
It’s a gas
just a dash of silicone
Shake your new maracas
and you’re fine
Tits and ass
can change your life
They sure changed mine.
You’re all looking at my tits now,
aren’t you?
I’d settle for one.
Go out and buy them.
Have it all done
Honey, take my word
Grab a cab and see the wizard
on Park and 73rd
Tits and ass
Orchestra and balcony
What they want is what you see
Do the best of you
Pits or class
I have never seen it fail
Debutante or chorus girl or wife
Tits and ass
yes, tits and ass
have changed
my life.
Thank you, Val.
Paul.
- When did you start dancing?
- Not until pretty late.
- Why?
- I don’t know, I just didn’t.
- What did you do?
- Nothing much.
- What was your family like?
- We were close.
- Any brothers and sisters?
- Two sisters.
One died when I was 14.
- How?
- I don’t want to talk about that.
Why do we have to talk about that?
Okay, Paul. Back in line.
Can he keep us standing here
this long?
Zach? We’ve been standing here
for quite a while.
Maybe we can take a five?
- Take five, everybody.
- Five means five, not fifteen.
Stanley, can I have
the One routine after the insert?
Uncle Harry’s heartburn kit.
One indigestible cold pastrami, -
- one lukewarm celery tonic.
- I’m catching the 6:30 plane.
- I just talked to Zach.
What’s the point? He doesn’t think
I came here for a job.
Tell me the truth.
When I left, how did he take it?
How did I know
he wanted me back?
Because he didn’t ring me once
to beg me to come back.
As if I would.
He can be sweet and funny,
and even warm.
Do me a favor. He is what he is,
so just stop talking about him.
Zach asked me to give you this:
The number of his business manager.
- He thought you might need...
- Money?
- He didn’t mean...
- "If I need some money!"
- All he meant...
- Please.
If you change your mind
about going back...
My sister was such a little brat.
But I guess it was a little extreme
shaving her head.
Want to hear about the first time
I saw a dead body? I was about seven.
Where the hell is Larry?
Everybody, go downstairs and
learn the lyrics to the One routine.
- Cassie... I’m trying to work.
- Me, too.
I don’t need a handout, I need a job.
It’s my turn to audition.
No. You shouldn’t have come.
This is for chorus.
- It’s not for you.
- It’s the only place for me.
I never had an apartment in my life
that wasn’t a sublet.
AII I know how to do
is to point my toes and leap.
Zach, I’m a dancer
That’s who I am
What I do
I’m a dancer
Give me the steps,
I"II come through
Give me somebody to dance for
somebody to show
Let me wake up to find
I have somewhere exciting to go
Christ, Cassie, how can I put you
in the line? You’re too good.
You bet I am.
I can dance any way you want.
Let me dance for you
let me try
Let me dance for you
We made a lot of music dancing,
you and I
- Are you talking about us?
- No.
I’m talking about a job,
I haven’t worked in over a year.
Please, give me an answer
Give me a place to begin
I’m a dancer
I have come home
Let me in,
give me somebody to dance with
Give me somebody to be
Let me wake up feeling proud
that the girl in the mirror is me
Let me dance for you,
let me try
Let me dance for you
We made a lot of music dancing,
you and I
Let me dance for you
Let me try
Let me dance for you
We made a lot of music dancing,
you and I.
Cassie!
All right. Go down to the others
and learn the Lyrics.
We'll see.
Yes, Paul?
I wanted to ask: If I can’t talk
about myself, I’m out?
You’re a hell of a dancer, Paul.
I can’t do it. I wish I could,
but I just can’t.
Can I ask you something?
Of you’re gonna change your name, -
- why take something Italian?
People always used to say
I don’t look Puerto Rican.
- You figure you look Italian?
- No.
I just wanted to be somebody new,
so I became Paul San Marco.
Why would you want to be
somebody new?
I don’t know.
I’m not too proud of myself, I guess.
Why did you become a dancer?
My father loves movies.
He used to take us to 42nd Street.
I loved the musicals.
- How old were you?
- 10-11.
- 42nd Street, with all those crazies?
- He didn’t know that. It was cheap.
Anyway, because of my eyes...
I wear contacts now...
...I’d have to move down front
by myself, so I could see.
Strange men would sit beside me
and play with me...
- Look, if this is too rough...
- No. I knew I was gay.
In school, they’d whistle at me
in the halls.
What bothered me was I didn’t know
how to be a man.
What was your first job as a dancer?
At the Jewel Box, the drag show.
I was 15. I went to audition, but
they weren’t interested in my dancing.
They said, "Show us your legs". They
took me to a filthy rat hole, -
- shaved my legs and put stockings
and high heels on me.
I was in show business. The asshole
of show business, but a job.
- What did you tell your parents?
- Just that I was a dancer in a show.
- They couldn’t stop bragging.
- Go on.
The show was going to Chicago,
and my parents came to say goodbye.
I don’t know why I said okay.
We were doing an Oriental number.
I had an Oriental dress -
- with an enormous head dress
with gold balls all over.
I was going out for the finale
when I saw my parents standing there.
They got there too early.
I freaked out.
I ran past them,
hoping they wouldn’t recognize me.
But when I passed I heard my mother
say, "Oh, my God. " I died.
After the show I took off my make-up
and dressed.
I didn’t know if they were
still downstairs.
But there they were,
in the middle of these freaks.
You should have seen them.
They didn’t know where to look.
My mother had the guts
to look me in the eyes.
I could tell she’d been crying.
"Make sure you eat good," she said.
My father couldn’t even look at me.
"Take care of yourself," he said.
They started out.
But then my father turned around
and went over to the producer.
"Take care of my son," he said.
That was the first time
he ever called me that.
Come on.
Are you okay?
Go grab a hat.
Bring them in.
Everybody on stage, let’s go!
Take one that fits.
This combination goes with the Lyrics
you just learned. Spread out.
I want to see unison dancing.
Every head, arm, body angle,
exactly the same.
I don’t want anybody to pull
my focus.
Let’s review it.
Starting position is upstage.
Chin up, head down.
Pop the right heel,
reverse directions.
One singular sensation
every little step she takes
You with us? On "singular sensation"
make sure your arm goes -
- all the way across your face
and back to shoulder.
...singular sensation
every little step she takes
One thrilling combination
every move that she makes
One smile and suddenly
nobody else will do
You know you’ll never be lonely
with you know who
Let’s go on,
away from the mirrors.
- When do we pop the chin?
- On two.
- When does the hat go up?
- On five...
Listen up!
Larry’s got the style I’m looking for.
Very thirties. Watch him.
Continue from
"moment in her presence... "
One moment in her presence
and you can forget the rest
For the girl is second best
to none
Give her your attention
Do I really have to mention
She’s the one.
Now in groups of four.
I want to hear the Lyrics
in each group.
Okay, just the girls.
Cassie, don’t roll the shoulders.
Diana, sharp in with the leg.
Cassie, no release in the head.
Cassie! Do it again with the boys.
You’re doing too much.
Don’t pop the head.
Cassie, this isn"t Vegas.
Look around.
Get your kicks even.
Goddamnit, Cassie,
you’re disturbing the combination!
From the top!
Come here!
Look at the routine.
Is that what you really want?
- That’s who I am.
- No, you’re special.
They’re all special. Paul, Bebe,
Sheila... Everybody up there.
You know what I’m talking about.
Look at them. Look at them!
- Why did you leave me?
- Why, you noticed...
- You said nothing about Hollywood.
- You’d just tell me to take it.
- I didn’t want you to tell me.
- You took it!
That’s one thing. Your telling me
to take it is something else.
Anyway, you’re the one who left,
months before I went to Hollywood.
- We were living together!
- In the same apartment.
- But when did I see you?
- Oh, the neglected woman?
Are you jealous of my work?
- You were so proud I made it...
- I was proud.
And I know that directing a show
takes 24 hours.
As long as I spend an equal 24 hours
with you? Could you tell me how?
If I knew that,
you’d be asking me for a job.
Don’t you know why I took that job
in Hollywood? Not for me, for you.
It was the only way
I could hold you, I thought.
To be a star like you.
Make you want me again.
Treat me important.
Ready, Zach?
Who do you want to pick?
I don’t know yet.
Let’s do the tap combination.
The tap combination will start
after the second eight count.
Girls downstage, boys upstage.
Nice and easy.
Kiss today goodbye
The sweetness and the sorrow
Wish me luck,
the same to you
But I can’t regret
what I did for love
What I did for love
Look, my eyes are dry
The gift was ours to borrow
It’s as if we always knew
And I won’t regret
what I did for love
What I did for love
Gone
love is never gone
As we travel on
Love’s what we'll remember
Kiss today goodbye
And point me toward tomorrow
We did what we had to do
Won’t forget, can’t regret
what I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
We’ll put you into groups of four.
Mike, Maggie, Paul, Connie...
Girls downstage, boys upstage.
Connie, smile bigger,
if you gotta fake it.
- Tapping is not my strong point.
- What?
- Tapping’s not my strongest point.
- I see that.
I"II be right back.
- Don’t move him.
- Larry. Call Dr. Rhodes.
- His knee was operated last year.
- Don’t move it.
I just twisted it.
Does anyone have Valium?
It’s already swelling.
You’re gonna be okay, Paul.
Should we give him that?
We don’t know what’s wrong.
I’ve had three already, since lunch.
It’s just a muscle relaxer.
Rhodes is waiting in Emergency
at St. Joseph’s.
You’re going to be all right. Rhodes
is the best knee doctor in town.
- Paul, I’ve got your bag!
- Good luck.
Call me from the hospital.
Do you ever think about what
you’ll do when you stop dancing?
Me?
Real life, I guess.
Getting married, having babies?
Going off my diet.
Mark, do you want spend your life
dancing in a chorus?
I just want to get in one.
You don’t remember, but we were in
a chorus together a 100 years ago.
- Of course I remember.
- You were a rotten dancer.
Why do you think I became
a choreographer?
- How have you been, Sheila?
- Since then, I don’t know...
Good. Terrific. So-so...
I actually found
the glass slipper once.
It fit, but then it broke.
I have a daughter. She’s nine.
She loves me a lot, hates me a lot...
And... God help her,
she wants to be a dancer.
What’s so wrong about that?
How can anybody want anything else?
I used to stand outside the stage door
and watch the girls come out, -
- thinking, "God, can anything
like that ever happen to me?"
Now I meet somebody and they say:
"Wow, you dance on Broadway?
You got somewhere. "
- Hell of a day, huh?
- Yeah...
A few months ago, the night before
I was to audition for another show, -
- I had a kind of breakdown.
I started crying and I couldn’t stop
for two weeks.
I just got out of hospital.
The doctor said it was too soon.
But I did.
And now, even if I lose, I won.
Hell of a day.
- Line "em up, Zach?
- Yeah.
Everybody on the line.
Before we start eliminating...
You’re all terrific.
And very special.
I wish I could hire you all.
Will the following people
please step forward.
Judy.
Don.
Greg.
Sheila.
Al.
Diana.
Excuse me...
Diana, will you get back in line?
Kristine.
Connie.
Maggie.
Front line, thank you very much.
I’m sorry.
Rehearsals begin September 22nd.
We rehearse for six weeks -
- with a two-week tryout,
either in Boston or Philadelphia.
The New York opening will be
some time mid-January.
Prepare to sign the standard minimum
contract with a six-month rider.
Check with Larry
for your costume measurings.
Do not, I repeat, do not change
your hairstyle or color.
I’m happy to be working with you.
It’s going to be very exciting.
Thank you very much.
Dick! That’s it. Thanks a lot.
Cassie...
How you dress!
You can get arrested for wearing
those colors.
One singular sensation
Every little step she takes
One thrilling combination
Every move that she makes
One smile and suddenly
nobody else will do
You know you’ll never be lonely
with you know who.
