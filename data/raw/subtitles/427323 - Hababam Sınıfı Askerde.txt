With the support
of the General Staff
To all the present and lost
colleagues of The Class of Chaos...
...especially Rifat ilgaz
and Ertem Egilmez.
Spread out!
Pass the ball! over here!
Penalty.
-Thanks.
-That was no penalty.
No! Never!
Thank you.
What have you done?
Why are you yelling at him?
Let me take the shot.
-We shouldn't risk it.
-Nonsense. What risk, man?
l'll rip your head off.
lf l can't score while
teacher Yusuf is goalkeeper, l'll quit.
-Get aside.
-You mean me?
-Yeah, you.
l'm not playing any more!
-Mrs. Cosmetician?
-Present.
Will my wrinkles disappear?
Don't worry. With time
they will all disappear.
What about those
that appear in the meantime?
What?
Hello.
-Hüseyin?
-Yes, sir?
What do you want again?
l came for the money for
the windows.
l already paid last Friday.
Did you forget?
No, l didn't.
This is for the windows
that were smashed during weekend.
-The total is 750 YTL.
-750 what?
New Turkish Lira.
How many windows can get
smashed at a school...
...within a weekend?
Five!2 downstairs, 2 upstairs
and one in the teachers room.
Whoa!
Animals, rascals, bandits!
Here, 750.
Actually it should be
750 YTL.
This is enough.
l should smack two of them...
...and then we'd see if they
ever break a window again.
God!
What's going on here?
Come over here.
Which idiot
threw the ball here?
lt wasn't us, Dad. l swear.
Looks like someone puked
over my dad's face.
Don't lie to me, pinhead!
Who did this?
The pinhead is right.
lt was me.
-Mr. Yusuf?
-Unfortunately it was me.
oh my!Mr Niyazi!
Here!
l really don't know
what to say.
Yeah, right.
Shut up!
Now you're in deep.
-But why?! lt wasn't us.
-Right.
So what?
Didn't l forbid you to play
football in the garden?
God knows how many times.
So, why are you there
it is forbidden?
We're having our PE class, right?
The PE teacher
ran away last week.
So?
That's why we ourselves made
sport during PE class.
Very funny!
Am l supposed to laugh?
l know what to do with you.
lt's time for a change.
From now on l will
attend PE...
But not in this outfit, right?
Don't you like it? ldiot.
-lt's oK.
-on the contrary.
Yes.
lt looks very good on you.
You should have
back cleavage as well.
And you shouldn't be
in this class.
Beat it!
Laugh about your own ass'.
Just look at you!
You look like athletes
from the old East block.
The times have changed.
The walls are down.
Forget about Football!
Now gym is in.
Gym as in Cimbom?
What's that got to do
with anything? Anthony Hopkins.
From now on you'll
work with sporting equipment.
Gym is no good for us. And
these are not fit for a man.
And we'd break them. We don't even
know how to use them.
He's got a point.
l'll show you how it's done.
An athlete who doesn't run is like
a clubber who doesn't dance.
Dad.
Yes, son?
How fast can it get?
As fast as you want.
And how fast can you run?
ln my youth
l reached 80 km/h.
How fast does he run now?
l've no idea. lt should
be here somewhere.
Wow! 4 km/h.
Wow!
Which means my dad is still
in shape despite his age.
He's faster than
a parked car.
l could skid with it
if l wanted to.
The hell you could.
All right.
Push the button!
Yes, sir!
oh God!
What's going on?
He really did 80 km/h.
Call your mothers. l'm going
to have a meeting with them.
lt's payback time!
This is illegal, you know?
What do you know about law,
you criminal?
Beware.
lf you even touch my hair, l'll
report you to the Culture Ministry.
Who are you going to
report where?
You. Which ministry was it?
Well, l thought about everything
when l planned my payback.
-What's that?
-The Joint Education Law.
Sounds nice, doesn't it?
There's one clause which is
perfect for you. lt reads...
''The hair of the male pupils
...should be cut No 3 long.''
What's No 3?
lt means almost skinhead.
Barbers, let's start!
Stop!
You can't get my hair cut!
Are you nuts?
Your hair will not be cut.
That's not fair then!
Get lost!
Don't drive me crazy!
or else l'll rip your hair out!
Get on with the cut. Attack!
Where's the applause?
Cut it! Don't hesitate!
lf l don't get
my revenge then my name...
...is no longer
Evil Kenan.
Don't worry.
From now on
they'll call you baldy Kenan.
Come on, laugh.
Don't cry.
We're ruined anyway.
What are we going to do?!
We'll take a cruel revenge.
We've got no choice.
But how?
-Hey, Psycho.
-What?
You look like my butt.
Let's stick him a spoon
in his ear.
Then we'd be even.
A table spoon?
A tea spoon would do too.
Would it go in?
Yes.
Bullshit, we're not pyschos.
Aren't we?
ls he inside?
lt can't get crueler than this.
Well done.
l sweet my butt off till
l could get...
-...this acid out of the lab.
-You should say sweat.
-Excuse me?
-Sweat.
-Excuse me?
-Never mind, come on.
-Stop!
-Why?
What if it burns my dad's
butt...
...and he gets a dash?
Don't worry. This acid
burns only fabric.
Was just a joke!
-Stop!
-What's the problem now?
Can l do it?
lt's very important for me!
l swore revenge!
Here you are.
-Stop!
-What?
Just wanted to know
if you'd stop.
Drink this!
Hurry or we'll get caught.
l wouldn't mind
even dying right now!
Should l say the Lunatic
is coming?
Talk decently, man.
Does he come or not?
l swear he's coming.
-oh no!
-Run! We're in trouble!
l'm paying you
for the last time!
Yeah, sure.
l've punished those tramps so hard,
they don't even dare to look...
...out of the window,
never mind breaking them.
You are sometimes really scary.
They don't call me
Lunatic Bedri in vain.
Many thanks.
There's no need to recount.
What's up? Why are you yelling?
What if l said
he's coming?
What if l came down
and gave you a beating?
l'll knock you down.
Does he come or not?
He's coming and he's very airy.
Come over. My dad's coming.
Have a nice day, sir.
Baldies. Thanks to you
the school has some fun.
Look how they grin. l'd commit
suicide if l were them.
Hababam boom boom.
Hababam...
oh Bedri,
your bum is so airy.
our beloved lunatic Bedri
l've fallen for your panty.
Bravo! Hurrah!
May God bless him. We had
so much fun thanks to him.
This happens when you
follow the fashion.
l wonder when he did notice?
l hope after the traffic cops.
Company, get up!
Good morning!
Wake them up.
Get up, quick.
Come on, get ready.
Are you ready?
-Respect.
-Well done.
Let go, man.
Hi, soldier. What's going on?
-Bedri, what have you done to us?
-To us as well.
-Where are we going?
-To the army.
We've caught the
deserters, sir. Roger.
-Bring them over! Roger.
-Yes, sir. Roger.
Military duty?
But we're still in school.
Make him stop talking.
He should get dressed.
Yes, sir!
Shut up! Get up!Get dressed!
With such a fine army
our nation is in good hands, right?
Amen, thank God.
-You'll pay for this.
-Come on, boy. Get going.
What's happening to us?
His service is not due yet.
He's just feeling old.
-Take him away.
-Yes, sir.
Why have you done this to us?
l'll come to take your
pictures during the ceremony.
-Have a nice military service.
-Why are you slapping me?
Just a second.
Do you have pillows there?
Answer man.
-Are we going out of town?
-Have a nice military service.
l'm a soldier. This guy
slapped me. l'd like to report him.
-Get in.
-All right.
Where's the cheering?
our soldiers are number one.
Dad, you're dead... dead.
That rat has informed on us.
That's why he got
our hair cut.
l can't believe that
he did go this far.
We'll take revenge
after 15 month.
15? My God!
What are we going to do guys?
Protect our fatherland, what else?
Am l right?
Excuse me,are you a captain?
How many days till discharge?
Why doesn't he talk?
ls your name Aziz?
Where are you taking us?
-To make real men out of you.
-Come again... Men?!
Everything for the fatherland!
Take them along.
Do what's necessary.
l'll do so. Get down!
Form a double file.
Now follow me.
Two things are important in life:
our family and our military.
You should be glad that we're here.
This place is like a holiday resort.
Shut up, man. Please.
Holiday resort, my ass.
Turks are born soldiers.
Forward!
Where are the goods?
Don't tell me ''They'll
arrive today or tomorrow.''
You said that yesterday.
Tomorrow is now today. You'll
say the same thing tomorrow.
They've just arrived.
Thanks. Fine. Bye.
Are you deserters?
No, we're just Fenerbahçe Fans.
Come closer. What's your name?
Ruhi. My friends
call me shortly 'Babyruhi'.
So you are the clown
of this group?
-Nice office. Yours?
-No, it belongs to the army.
This desk belongs
to the army as well.
From now on, you too belong
to the army. ls it clear?
Very clear colonel.
l've been here for 7 years
now and haven't seen a colonel.
Did you hear that? His seventh
year in military service.
-We're in deep trouble.
-We'll grow old here.
-Shall l give the uniforms?
-Let them run around like clowns.
-Really?
-We've got things to do. Get lost.
Come on.
Here, take the boots.
-l need them in size 45.
-They are all size 45.
But my shoe size is 42.
Don't worry. lt will be
45 in one week.
Will we get
a cartridge belt?
Here you are.
And how about bayonets?
We're handing out chainsaws,
would you like to have one?
Really?
-What will we do afterwards?
-Whatever you wish.
-You're free.
-Come on now. Get dressed.
Guess who
Melissa lbrikci is dating?
Nusret Holdenberg.
She's a dumb one.
Military service is not
as tough as we thought it would be.
What did you think?
You suffer only till you start.
This Sabit is a nice fellow.
l respect him.
He too is a psycho.
our shift is over. We'll
meet here again in the evening.
-What till then?
-Shall we go and pick up some girls?
-Great idea. We could eat as well.
-Hey, hold on.
l don't think we're
that free, right?
Don't think so. lt'd be better
if we stayed here.
-Should we get some food?
-Yes!
He fainted from joy when he heard
the word 'food'.
-Come on, this is the restaurant.
-Nice place.
Let's join the tables.
Dozer, hold on, we're almost done.
l hope that the food is good,
l'm starving.
The military is know for delicious
and plentiful food.
And it's free.
My cousin was 50 kilos and came
back from the army 100 kilos.
Did he return with a friend?
He's really goofy.
Waiter, menu please.
Dozer, what are you going to eat?
Anything.
Look around.
They've lost their appetite
when they saw Dozer.
The service is really slow.
Waiter. We're starving.
The menu, please.
Never mind the menu.
Just tell me what food you have.
Hi, guys.
They are not 'guys'.
Where's the men's room?
Don't you have one?
Do you have wet packs?
These waiters are a little dope.
Dear God.
What are you doing?
To your places! Stop talking!
Tummy inside,
breast out.
-Looks like a nice guy.
-Yes. He's doomed.
l'm your sergeant.
My name is Demir lcbükey.
l don't feel hunger, nor do
l get tired or cold. l never sleep.
He's an android.
-l expect the same from you.
-We're done for.
l hate all who get hungry, cold,
tired or sleepy.
This guy is an original maniac.
-Very good.
-Excuse me?
Why ''excuse me''? Very good!
ls this not Mr Niyazi?
Keep still.
Don't move. Attention!
Regiment 146, is at your service
with its 40 members.
At ease!
So, these are the guys...
...who remained in high school
to evade military service.
-Yes, sir!
-Even his voice is the same.
-This must be Mr Niyazi's double.
-Everyone has a double.
That's valid for how many people?
Look who's coming.
No way.
He shaved off his moustache.
-At ease!
-Good morning, sir.
Good morning, sergeant.
So, that's them?
-l'm getting scared.
-Yes, sir.
-Shame on you!
-ls this some kind of a joke?
l don't know.
So you are the tramps
who evaded the service?
Don't you recognize us?
Pop, it's us.
Who do you call pop? Didn't you
teach them the ranks?
l didn't have time yet, sir.
-Do it immediately.
-Yes, sir!
-l don't want this to happen again.
-Yes, sir.
Dad, you look funny.
Well, what should l say?
We almost fell for it.
-You're some trickster.
-What's your name?!
Semiramis.
Dad, are you putting me on?
Semiramis, listen carefully.
Don't you ever say ''dad'' to me,
you'll address me as ''Sir''.
And don't speak
unless you're spoken to.
-ls it clear?
-oh God.
-Got it, private?
-Got it, sir.
The commander is coming, sir.
They make fun with us.
Make him stop talking.
Make him stop talking!
Attention!
You see that? So it was all
Brother Güdük's plan.
Are these the guys with
discipline problems?
Yes, sir!
-You're number one, Brother Necmi.
-Brother Güdük.
ls it the first time
they see a general?
They are a little confused.
l won't forget this.
l almost lost it.
-Can we discipline them?
-Don't worry, sir. Definitely.
You're the man.
Small but still big.
-Good, may God help you.
-Thank you, sir!
Major, the major is coming.
Left, left...
Hold on! Dozer is down.
Come on. Get up.
-What's going on?
-Watch it.
Such a shame. Look at him.
He's turned skin and bones.
l won't run any more.
You don't get it, do you?
You don't know where we are.
Look, l'm telling you; this is just
a set up. Everything here.
-Setup? Sertap Erener?
-Hold on there.
We're talking about Lunatic Bedri.
We made his butt go public.
He'd do anything
to get revenge.
Pay money...
Make a setup...
-And involving Necmi too?
-Definitely.
-Would Güdük betray us?
-He's insane.
lt seems a little strange.
But you know what they say...
Everybody has a double.
lt's hard to believe but
everybody has a double.
Did we chance upon
all the doubles that exist?
That's life, man. There
are Lunatic Bedris everywhere.
Later on, during work we'll meet
again such a Lunatic Bedri.
-What's this, man?
-oh baby...
Hey, Jackhammer,
do your thing.
Don't worry.
Everything's for the fatherland.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
-That's some nice lunchbox.
-Thanks.
-Where did you buy that?
-Don't know. lt's my dad's.
-Your dad's? Does he work here?
-Well, sort of.
-Sort of? ls he a soldier?
-Yes, he is.
He's managed it good to
evade the service for so long.
-Are you Sabit's daughter?
-No, l'm the general's daughter.
Your dad has been a general
for how long now?
-Why? Do you know him?
-No, how could l?
By the way, my name is Ceylan.
And yours?
-Everything.
-Everything?
Everything's for the fatherland.
What's wrong, Jackhammer?
Who's the chick?
Don't ask. She's the
general's daughter.
-Güdük's daughter?
-Güdük? He just looks like him.
-The guy is a real general.
-Yeah, right.
Come on, my little caretta...
Eat, come on.
-Dad?
-ls it you my child? Welcome.
You left your lunch.
Why did you bother?
l could have had something here.
Please don't. l cook for you
so that you don't have to eat here.
But the soldiers get
good food, my child.
You should make a diet
as the doctor ordered.
Here's your boiled cauliflower,
Boiled potatoes. And boiled apples.
And as dessert
boiled Baklava.
-You are not to eat sugar.
-This doctor is going too far.
l'm general and l can't forbid
the soldiers from so many things.
Come in!
Sir...
-Step in Bedri, are you hungry?
-Thanks, sir. l already had lunch.
Good. You can go now, thanks.
You're welcome. Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
-Have a nice day, Uncle Bedri.
You too my child.
You asked for me, sir.
Bedri, do you know
what's on the menu today?
Meatballs, baked macaroni
and fruit pudding.
-Which is delicious by the way.
-Really?
Come in!
-Do you have some time for me?
-Well, of course. Come in, major.
-Major.
-Major.
-What's up?
-The file is ready.
l wanted to present it to you before
sending it to the general staff.
Looks like you'll persist.
This is not persistence but
an idealistic approach.
lt's the goal of my life.
What can l say?
l hope for the best.
-Thanks.
-Don't expect too much.
lt could be that the commanders
are reluctant to accept it.
-l'd like to try anyway.
-Well, we'll see. Good luck.
-Thank you. Major.
-Major.
What do you think about
this project?
Project? l have no
information about it.
Major Zehra will submit to
the general staff a project:
To make girls
join the army as well.
What? Girls?
l beg your pardon
but this is insane.
lt makes you shiver, right?
-This is not a joke, right?
-No, you've seen the file.
Maybe it would be better if the file
does not reach the general staff.
l don't want to interfere but maybe
you can talk her out of this.
So we can stop this meaningless
adventure before it starts.
-l wish to be excused.
-All right.
-They're going.
-As if l care! Let them.
Why should we run?
They'll come back anyway.
-Look who's coming.
-The dude with many stripes.
Hold on, don't stand up.
So you say this is not Mr Niyazi?
You'll see how l'll unmask him.
-What's going on?
-We're looking for lenses, teacher.
Not teacher.
You'll say ''Sir ''.
-Where?What type?
-Little and blue.
Enter!
Can you spare me 5 minutes?
of course, Major.
-l have a request from you.
-l'm listening, Major Bedri.
ln short: Girls can not
attend military service.
Can they be officers?
That's not the same.
Why should you disrupt the
functioning dynamics of the army?
lt's not up too you.
Don't overstep your authority.
Satisfy your feministic needs
somewhere else.
This is the army,
not a beauty parlor.
l apologize, l've lost myself.
But l ask you not to send
this project to Ankara.
And l say ''lt's too late.''
l've already sent it.
What's your intention?
Do you want the garrison
to smell nail polish?
lt's better than stinking socks.
-Don't piss me off Zehra!
-Go call your dad Zehra.
You can't talk to me like this.
otherwise l'll call you Bedish.
-All right, l apologize.
-Not accepted.
Girls can not attend
military service.
They can, Major.
Even better than men.
Please, don't make me laugh.
-So, do you want to cry?
-What do you mean?
You can see it yourself.
-What's going on there?
-They are doing their military service.
Here, major.
Now, excuse me.
l guess l just
saw something blue.
-Look, who's coming.
-Attention!
Don't get up.
That's just my father.
-What is going on here?
-They've lost their contact lenses.
Contact lens?
How dare you tricking him?
-We were very tired, sir.
-Come again?
-You're performing very well.
-Semiramis, get up.
-Daddy, don't exaggerate.
-l said get up!
Don't get annoyed.
You sicko. Don't you ever
say dad to me again.
Talking out of line
will be punished.
Like now. You'll run
double distance.
-Chutt!
-What's with him?
He's not much into running.
He must be 750 kilo or something.
Help him on his feet.
He weighs 3-4 time more
than the legal limit.
Get him to the infirmary. They should
classify him as unfit.
-Yes, sir.
-Take him away.
-Please. l promise to lose weight.
-l can't train you like this.
-lt's dangerous and forbidden.
-Come, son.
Take good care, pals.
l'll come back...
-...after l lose weight.
-Bye.
Don't take it too hard.
-We'll wait for you.
-Don't slim down too fast...
...it's not healthy.
My mum.
Keep going guys,
15 days have passed.
-There's much more ahead, right?
-Why do you depress us?
-The service won't end.
-Hopefully.
-You're really into it, Psycho.
-Any objections?
No. You're taking it
way too serious.
Military service
is a serious matter.
Which service? My dad is making
fun of us. Don't you see?
Shut up! or l'll bring
the tea spoon.
l wouldn't make a sound
if l were you.
-Moviestar, you have a visitor.
-Really? Who?
Not you, you ox.
The handsome guy.
For me?
Yes, at the garrison entrance.
-l have a visitor.
-So what?
-Did you see anyone?
-Why?
-Do you always reply by questions?
-Who?
-You.
-When?
-What do you mean 'when'?
-Are you deranged or what?
-No.
-Get lost.
Where?
Guess who l am?
Mum?
-No, wrong: Ceylan.
-oh God, the generals daughter.
Hush. lf my father finds out
you'll get in trouble.
-And he'd get mad at me.
-So leave. What do you want?
-l made you a cake.
-What cake?
-With carrots.
-Carrots?
This is for you.
l've brought you my photo.
-Will you hang it in your locker?
-Please, don't ask me to do this.
Stop yelling. Smile.
What?
l wanted to take your photo.
To show the girls
at school, my love.
-Love? What kind of love?
-Love of my life.
Come on Ruhi, hurry up.
Raise your butt.. Come on. Move!
Psycho, come here a second.
Stand up. What are you doing?
-Respect, sir.
-Go back to your place.
Move it.
-oh, boy.
-Jackhammer, come over.
All who come don't leave.
Why should we run?
Ercü, come down.
Jump!
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5,...
What are you doing there?
-This is not a military area.
-Get lost.
-Run Dozer, run.
-What the hell? Catch him.
No news from Ankara?
Nothing yet.
Maybe they couldn't reply because
they are still busy laughing.
l wonder if you'll still be able
to laugh after l receive an answer.
Left, left, left, left.
Your snipers are here.
We're going to have some fun.
They look ineffective...
but as soon as they get
their hands on their weapons...
...they become instinctively heroes.
They are men after all.
Maybe that's the problem.
Please, the art of war
is embedded in men.
-What are the 3 words?
-Eyesight, backhand, forehand.
-Wrong. How do you aim?
-Align eye, backsight, foresight.
-Very good.
-You.
-Not me.
-Not you. You. Come here.
How was it: eye, backsight,
foresight. Lower it.
Why shouldn't l raise it?
You don't hold it like that?
No. Why are you pointing
your gun this way! Turn away.
Shall l take
him down, sir?
Drop the gun, Psycho!
-Leave Psycho alone, Kenan!
-Don't interfere, Jackhammer!
Don't interfere!
Turn towards this side!
Dad, you better lay down.
You're risking it.
Semiramis, shut up.
And you son, lower the gun.
-Don't pull the trigger.
-This trigger?
Dad!
okay. l won't touch it.
-Are you all right, Bedri?
-l guess so.
She'll throw away all my mail
She won't read my sms.
lf l get back and apologize,
she may calm down.
Well, don't.
As if l care.
This guy is goofy.
Private, what are you up to?
Are you smoking?
-l wasn't going to light it.
-You again?
-What are you doing here?
-l'm stepping watch.
lt's ''standing watch''
and not stepping.
During watch, you shouldn't smoke.
lt's unhealthy.
Who the hell
gave you a gun?
Sergeant Demir.
But he took away the ammo.
Good so. Don't smoke during
watch, all right?
-Yes.
-Good night, son.
Good night.
-Stop. Password?
-Which password, man?
-You know, hood fume.
-The password is 'hood fume'.
-Perfect. That's correct.
-Don't shoot, were coming down.
-That's awesome.
-Baby, we brought you smoke.
Right on time.
We're not allowed to smoke here,
the major would get mad.
He told me just recently
and forbid me to smoke.
Where should we smoke?
Don't know but not here.
Let's get inside if Major Bedri
isn't against it.
But he didn't tell a word.
We'll get smoked there.
-Get in.
-How will we light the cigarettes?
-l have a light.
-Hand it over. Where is it?
Here. Take it.
Sir, the arsenal
did explode.
l've noticed.
Be carefull.
You've made a mess
and took us down as well.
We were having some nice
action military service here.
He's clueless, ok.
But didn't you see the
giant sign that reads ''arsenal''?
-You've been really stupid.
-Ruhi, will you shut up?
-l can't stand it any longer.
-Calm down, there's not much left.
With compliments from the chief.
Enough. l've had it.
What's this, man?
Hold on. Calm down.
lt's almost over.
The hell it is over.
Death to potatoes!
-Don't do it!
-Jackhammer. Grab him!
Don't add up more time to our
service.
The major is around here.
This is no military service. That's
not the major, that's my father!
-Relax, Ercü.
-Don't touch me! Let go!
l swear l'll knock you down.
Don't follow me. All right?
Where are you going to, idiot?
Where to?
Home!
Don't dare following me.
-Stop! Where are you going?
-You're putting on...
...a nice act but l have to go
back to school. Say hello to my dad.
-Who's your dad?
-Lunatic Bedri, who else?
-Do you mean Major Bedri?
-This is a major bullshit.
He's Lunatic Bedri.
And he served at the military
as a sergeant.
l have to leave.
Stay where you are.
Are you mad?
Please let me go. Don't force
me to use this on you.
Hold on, don't get mad,
you will leave soon.
We should keep
those walking bad omens...
...away from explosive things.
The gas cylinder in the kitchen
could be dangerous.
We have an
amok runner, sir.
What? Who had a fit?
-The dude who calls you 'dad'.
-Where's he now?
l'm here dad,
but l'll get going.
-l don't feel good.
-So you don't feel good?
lt's highly normal, right?
We've been here for days.
Very normal. l get fed up
sometimes as well.
-of course.
-Even several times a day.
Just a second.
l don't understand why you're
keep on doing this thing?
Which thing?
Do you see the potato?
This military service thing.
l've been almost
30 years soldier.
Semiramis.
What's really troubling you?
Dad, don't start again.
lf you don't call me dad,
l won't call you Semiramis, deal?
l'm laughing but l'm also
starting to get scared.
Poor guy. We should take him
to the infirmary.
Lieutenant Colonel Yusuf
should examine him.
-This is too much, Necmi.
-What do you mean?
The boy has
a nervous breakdown.
l'm taking him
to Mr. Yusuf.
May you get well soon.
Thanks Necmi. Congratulations
on your galaxy, Güdük.
-Güdük?
-lt means ''shorty.''
-l see.
-l'm taking you to the doctor.
Please, after you.
May God not give anyone
mental problems.
Bad news Bedri. Do you
remember Zehra's Project?
Yes. Why?
The project was approved.
-oh no!
-We're the pilot area.
-No, no, sir.
-l saved the worst for last.
The first volunteers
arrive today: 40 girls.
-Did you say 40?
-Zehra went to get them.
l'd like to collapse here
with your permission.
-Are you oK, Bedri?
-No, sir. l'm not oK.
Come in.
We have an emergency.
-l hope it's no one aggressive.
-Look here, it says neurologist.
What the...?
Bravo. You guys are good.
Got nothing else to say teacher.
So l look just like your teacher?
You could have at least
changed your names.
That's what annoys me the most.
You guys keep on playing the
whole time. That's great.
Colonel, Lieutenant Colonel.
Let's have a nice conversation, oK?
Let's put an end to this.
lt was meant to be fun... but...
What on Earth?
oh, God. Girls?
-What's wrong? Why do you cry?
-l've started seeing girls.
-When do you see them?
-Now. They're getting off the bus.
Poor guy.
l see them from time to time
as well.
Really?
Then l close my eyes and
count to 10. So they disappear.
They're still there.
What?
Where do they come from?
Can you see the girls?
Yes, you not?
l said yes.
lt was nice meeting you.
l'm much better. Well l guess so.
l'm out of here. Bye.
No word from Ercü. Did he go nuts
or is he faking?
He's really nuts.
lt's pretty obvious, isnt't it?
With compliments from the chief.
What kind of a compliment is this?
Girls...
The chicks are here.
The nutcase broke out
from the nuthouse.
Don't you understand?
The girls are here.
We understand. Calm down
Everything will turn out fine.
A bus, stuffed with 40 beauties.
Did he walk on the main street or what?
Yes, he did.
Don't worry.
l'll be at the door.
-As if we go to the ladies' room.
-He was fine looking, wasn't he?
-He looked very horny.
-Just like all those out there.
-He must have been here 1 year.
-We'll get to meet many others.
-l say at least 3000 more.
-This is like Rabbit lsland.
God!
-So... Do you believe me now?
-l apologize thousand times.
What now?
You're out of words, right?
Just like that. Perfect.
-Come down now! lt's our turn!
-Are we going to undress now?
Get out of here.
What's going on there?
l don't know.
oh my, what's that?!
What's going on here, guys?
We built a tower
and wanted to show it to you.
Since you're
Tower Academy graduate.
-Shut up, private.
-Attention!
You won't believe me
but l couldn't see a thing.
How dare you peeping
on your fellow soldiers?
We couldn't get to peep.
Sister Zehra came in too early.
What 'sister', you idiot?
We're not shooting
a soap opera here!
Fortunately Major Zehra
didn't file a complaint.
-Are we getting away with it?
-There won't be jail. But a punishment!
You'll receive the hardest
punishment.
l guess now we're done for!
Take position.
You'll all do 5 push-ups!
Are you sure? Just five?
Shut up! Take position!
What a lovely punishment.
-Even l could do five.
-l once did six.
Let's start! one...
Two...
Three...
Four...
one...
one...
Two...
Three...
Four...
Keep going. 1 ! 2! 3! 4!
Go on.
When will he say five?
one. Two.
Three. Four.
He almost killed us.
Well, we are dead.
-l thought he's never say five.
-He showed mercy.
lf it were for my father
we'd still be at four.
We suffered yet
it was worth it.
You did peep
and we got punished.
-Today me, tomorrow you.
-The girls are going nowhere.
Just think; 40 girls are
sleeping 20 meters away from us.
Are the poor girls tired too?
That's not the point, stupid.
-Should we pay them a visit?
-Are you nuts?
l can't do another
5 push-ups.
l can. l could do
even 55.
The hell you can!
At 54 he's start all over again.
Should we risk it?
40 beautiful chicks!
How do we get in there?
There's a guard at the door.
So we'll fool him.
l won't get dressed as a woman.
Then we'll disguise as officers.
Where will we get uniforms?
May you get better!
Do you need anything?
l have painkillers,
ointments, muscle relaxer.
We were just talking about you.
Private, what are you doing here?
You scared him to death.
He didn't let me
leave the garrison.
-l'm going to kill him.
-What are you doing?
Let's go!
Wake up!
Stand still. No questions!
Attention!
So, you're the volunteers.
Yes, sir!
Private, what's your name?
Tanker, Melisa Toros
from Mersin. At your order.
-What's your phone number?
-Excuse me?
-Your number, Private!
-... .........
Fine!
What's your name, child?
Tanker, Esra Sezer
from Ankara. At your order.
-Good. What's your sign?
-Pisces.
-Really? Mine too!
-Pisces?
-Unbelievable, mine too.
-Sorry?
What's your ascending sign?
What's my ascending sign?
-So your name is Arzu?
-Yes.
Do you know this song?
Attention!
Don't laugh without permission!
You can't laugh about
commanders.
But our commander
made a joke.
-Could be. But still.
-Don't yell at her!
What's going on here?
You need wings to fly.
That's how you crawlç
Do you know how l can so easily
rotate this chain?
oh my. oh my!
Bedri is old enough to be my dad
but he's still a major.
-Look, now l'm separating it.
-Unbelievable.
-No. Just a joke.
-You're wicked.
Even l didn't believe it the
first time l saw this. She's naive.
-Punch me.
-What?
When you hold the wrist
like this and twist, it will break.
-What happened?
-lt caused pain.
There's no pain
during military service.
-Have you ever been to Taksim?
-No, l'm from lzmir.
-Which team do you support?
-Galatasaray.
-What? Me too.
-Really?
What did you think?
-Where are they?
-They're inpecting the girls' form.
-How many were on the committee?
-l've counted six.
one army general,one air force
general,one admiral...
...two SAS commandoes
and a military band master.
That's some strange committee!
What's going on here?
oh boy, there's another one.
What's going on here?
What do you think you're doing?
What sort of a scandal is this?
What's this impertinence?
Do you still think
you're at school?
No.
l guess we're at the military.
Find out where
the uniforms came from.
Yes, sir.
Unbelievable. l have
never seen such a thing!
And l don't want to see it again!
Behave in accordance. That's it!
And l don't want to see it again!
Behave in accordance. That's it!
l have given them proper
punishment. They won't do it again.
-Unless they are encouraged.
-Can l answer?
Go ahead.
The girls didn't
encourage anyone.
Please don't falsely accuse the girls
for the men's behavior.
-Can l respond?
-Go ahead.
l'm not making false accuses.
But don't forget...
...if you put 40 girls among
thousands of men...
...then you are responsible for
such events. You got that?
The only thing l get
is that you hate women.
You got me wrong there.
l love women.
-But only outside the military zone.
-Then go and love them.
-l wish to be excused.
-of course.
l'm sorry that you had to
witness such a controversy.
What's with the enmity
between you two?
You two are quick-tempered.
You're like fire and powder.
ls there any sort of enmity
of which l'm not aware of?
lt's not enmity.
Just an old history...
-History? How old?
-Very. Goes back to the academy.
-Look, if you don't want to tell...
-There's not much to tell.
We were classmates.
And old love story then.
Well, not completely.
lt was one-sided.
Really? Have a seat.
Thank you.
l asked her out for a date.
What did she say?
Did she refuse?
l don't know. l didn't
get any answer from her.
So, that's why you two
never got married?
l don't know
about Zehra's reasons.
But what you've said
is true on my part.
Do you still love her?
Whatever.
-How are your 'tough sergeants'?
-They are at tank training.
-l hope they don't cause trouble.
-Hopefully.
What was that?
-What's going on?
-We should take cover.
oh no! Süheyla!
Süheyla?!
Are you all right, sir?
They need protection.
They are becoming extinct.
Where are these bastards?
Who?
Did you lose your mind?
Why did you shoot?
l didn't shoot. l was
trying to open the hatch.
Bravo.
Just a second.
Shit.
Why is he in the tank?
Don't know. l was looking
for him since the morning.
Attention!
-What's going on here?
-Nothing.
We were talking about
how l accidentally made a shot.
Ruhi, you again?
Yes. lt's me.
lt started again.
Chill out. Stop the tank.
How can l stop it?
on your right
there's a lever arm.
Yeah. l have one
on the left too.
lmbecile. Those are your arms!
l'm talking about
the metal levers.
There's something here.
l guess l've found it.
l think this tank is down.
Where are you guys?
These girls make me furious.
Me too.
Yes. They are so repulsive.
l'm getting furious as well.
Actually, they are nice girls.
How hopeless can it get for us?
-Even their beloved are here.
-They'll leave soon.
Take a look at us. Doesn't even
one person love us?
And there's 40 of us.
-At least we'll score once.
-What?
Do you see that? The real Bedri.
How dare he come here?
Why didn't you guys
even give me a call?
You good-for-nothings.
l'm here.
What do you want?
Are you making fun with us?
Hold on a second. Stop.
-Don't you have any conscience?
-of course l do.
You don't know what l'm going
through since month'.
Do you think it's easy
to stay at school all by myself?
Step aside. Give way.
l've noticed this too late.
l came to apologize
from you guys.
l really did something stupid.
Don't be upset. lt's over.
-Right, stop it.
-Ercü, he's very sad.
Ercü, sit down.
Can you forgive your father?
Forgive him.
Don't interfere in affairs
between father and son.
-My son.
-Dad, daddy.
Take it. Eat some dessert.
Attention!
Handsome guy.
ls he your commander?
Yes.
-Yo, superstar!
-Yes, Dursun!
-You have a visitor.
-oh no, not again.
Stop being an ox! The girl
has come all the way.
l've missed you a lot,
my love!
-Yeah?
-Did you miss me too?
-Well, of course.
-Really? How much?
l don't know.
l didn't measure it.
You have lovely eyes.
lf only l could take
one of them back home.
No, please don't!
Don't be scared.
l didn't mean it literally.
Your eyes are much nicer
below your eyebrows.
Your's too. Now go, please.
Before someone catches us.
l'm leaving. Don't be sad.
l'll come again. Deal?
Deal. Don't hurry.
We'll meet again.
Sweetheart, you forgot something.
-Don't say sweetheart, sweetheart!
-Yes, sweetheart.
-What's this?
-l've made it for you.
Fine, many thanks.
l have to go. Kiss.
Today is very calm,
isn't it?
-Do you have any orders for me?
-Yes. We should be careful.
The maneuvers start in 2 days.
Nothing should go wrong.
Don't worry, sir! l personally
will take care...
of their training. Everything
is under my control.
Nice lunchbox.
Where did you buy it?
lt's my father's.
l have the same.
Bought it while l was at the
academy. Put your arm down.
The lunchbox will
stick to your face.
Yes, sir!
Yesterday l had the same
during dinner!
Squash pancakes...
Now, that's some coincidence!
Kemal Pasha - Dessert!
All Turks are born soldiers...
oh highlands.
Tempo. Tempo.
Don't fold your arms!
Faster, faster.
They get more dangerous each day.
Don't get fooled
by their Jackie Chan attitude.
ln a real fight everything's
different. Am l right, Psycho?
They're just girls.
Just a slap would do.
-The red forces are in position.
-Good.
l want you to know that if your
girls succeed...
The blue forces are in position.
We're ready.
Fine. What was l saying?
lf your girls succeed...
...then l'll write
a very positive report.
-Thanks.
-You should know it too.
Yes, sir.
Let's start!
l wish you success.
-Thank you.
-Thank you!
-Major.
-Major.
Attention!
Be a little more generous with it.
Don't talk nonsense!
This is no perfume.
-A bush is approaching.
-Let me see.
Are you ready?
Yes sir!
-Gather around me!
-Yes, sir. Quick!
Listen carefully. We're here.
The blue forces.
-This the enemy camp.
-And what's here?
Nothing. ldiot.
Shut up and listen!
All right. This is what you're
going to do. Listen now!
ln groups of two you will spread
out, in a snake form.
Under the cover of the darkness
you'll raid the enemy camp.
You'll seize the enemy banner.
And so the girls will go home.
Hush. You'll give away our
position. Any questions?
Will all the girls
go to the same house?
They'll go to the same house.
Now, listen.
-You get the most important duty.
-Do you swear?
l do. l want you
to understand something.
You'll stay here and
defend our banner. All right?
No.
Guest 1 !
Host 1 speaking, roger!
Host 1 . Guest 1 here.
At your order. Roger.
-We'll start with my signal flare.
-oK!
Blue forces!
l trust you!
l have no choice.
Surprise me by winning.
Make the red forces flee!
Don't let 3 girlies embarrass me
at this age. l beg you.
Promis.
Here we go.
l'm trusting you. Show yourselves.
Death to women... Attack!
Don't exaggerate, sicko!
Calm down.
There's a commander here.
l'm giving commands. Attack!
Allah... Allah...
Don't shout
or they'll catch us.
oh God! oh God!
We should've been more silent.
Am l right, you idiot?
Thanks to you l've been
captured for the first time.
She's my student. l have
trained her. Bravo, soldier.
Shut up! Move!
Why are we doing this?
ln order not to be seen.
Did you never watch movies?
lf anyone wants to
they still can.
Don't talk nonsense.
l can't even see myself.
Who could see us?
Get up. Move it...
-Hi.
-What's up?
-When do the maneuvers start?
-Get up. Move.
Don't get wild on me.
Can we talk a little?
Get going.
Everybody should capture
his girlfriend.
Deal.
Do we have to hand over
the prisoners immediately?
What the--? Dear God.
They've caught you.
-Don't laugh and help me down.
-You look funny.
Hands up...
And you, hands down...
Don't try anything...
Who are you?
Who's there?
Who's there? Stop, password?
ls it you, Demir? Demir?
Password? Stop, stop...
Ruhi... Ruhi...
Arzu! oh, it's you.
And l thought it's the enemy.
-l almost got scared to death.
-Actually, we are your enemies.
-We came to get your banner.
-Really?
lf you want it that much
you can have it.
Won't your commander
be mad at you?
He'll say nothing.
Besides, he told me that noone
should take the banner...
...not that
l am not to give it away.
Pioneer 1 . This is Guest 1 .
Give me your coordinates. Roger.
Pioneer 1 . Come in.
Demir, where are you? Answer me.
Pioneer. Scout. Where are you?
They were all captured. Roger.
How come all of them? Roger.
They were caught, Roger.
Caught? Zehrosh?
-Yes, Bedish?
-What do you mean?
-Hands up.
-This is embarrassing. Don't push.
The girls will cheer.
lt looks like the red forces
have won.
Where's Major Bedri?
There he is. Look...
You can put your hands down.
The maneuvers are over.
-This is a shame, right?
-Not at all.
ln the end, the winners are
our soldiers too. Congrats.
-Thanks.
-You've deserved it.
Everyone gets
what he deserves, right?
Stop it.
lt was just a maneuver.
Being a good loser is something.
And being able to win,another skill.
We were defeated soundly.
ldiot, you gave the banner
to the girls.
But look how they dance now,
and we can look.
Attention!
l'm proud of you all.
You've shown everyone
what women can do.
Thank you for your determination.
We didn't do a thing.
The rivals were weak.
Leave the boys alone.
They are embarrassed anyway.
Well. Have fun.
Turn the music down a bit.
Yes, sir.
She's coming. Run!
Throw away the cigarettes.
Donkeys!
-Machine gun, wake up.
-What?
-You have a visitor.
-Again her?
You don't understand anything
about love.
And you'll teach me, or what?
What are you doing
here so early?
Sweetheart, l just found out.
Don't cry. Why are you so sad?
Was just a maneuver.
They wouldn't send us into exile
just because we lost, right?
You are being transferred.
What am l going to do without you?
-Just a second. What did you say?
-Didn't you know?
-Know what?
-That you're going to Kütahya.
-Kadir Özüpek.
-Here.
You're going to Ceyhan, Adana.
-Kenan Esme.
-Here.
-Bosnien Herzigovina.
-Herzigova? Eva?
-Fahri Kaptanoglu.
-Here.
-Mamak, Ankara. Numan Uslu.
-Here.
-Hakkari, Çukurca.
-Now l'll do real military service.
You get happy over strange things.
What is my destination, Sabit.
Right away...
...Afganistan.
What the...?
ls this all a joke?
Where am l supposed to?
You're lucky.
You're going to Bodrum.
But l don't know how to swim.
Just a second. Just to clear things
out can't we all go...
...to the same place?
You're not going on vacation.
You're being transfered.
Do you have to seperate us?
Well, together
you're good for nothing.
Bravo, Dursun, well put.
-Do you have a minute?
-of course, come in.
l wanted to congratulate you.
only to congratulate?
Yes. And l owe you
an apology.
An apology? You?
l have still second thoughts about
girls in military service.
But my worries are groundless
for Turkish girls.
l'd like to apologize
from you and your troops.
Apology accepted.
Thanks.
Now if you'd excuse me.
We just got used to this place.
Don't worry, we'll
do it elsewhere too.
lf only we all would
go to Bodrum.
l would even accept Afghanistan
if only we would be all together.
Attention!
At ease!
Why are you not on leave?
-No, we're staying.
-Are you punishing yourselves?
No. We thought we'd
leave the punishment to you.
Don't fear! There's no punishment.
You're leaving on Monday anyway.
We know. That's
why we're upset.
We didn't plan
to fall apart.
-How long are you friends now?
-Nine. Ten. Twelve years.
Fifteen.
You'll find each other
after the military service.
We have annoyed you a lot.
Please, forgive us.
Never mind Semiramis. At least
you don't call me dad any more.
Did you work something out
for tomorrow?
-What's tomorrow?
-A farewell party.
You know such things,
entertain your friends.
This is just the way
l like orders.
-We won't disappoint you.
-Yeah, sure. l'll come to believe it!
Attention!
-The Major is a nice lad.
-Fine dude.
Guys, let us put something nice
on the scene to make him happy.
He'll be happy enough
when we're gone.
Would you guys like
to get photos?
-What sort of photos?
-A soldier souvenir photo.
Yes, let's do it.
-Are you ready?
-Yes.
l'm shooting.
Military operation.
Mobilisation order.
Heroes of the Turkish Army.
History is full with mighty
victories of the Turkish Army...
...which has its roots
among the Turkish people.
The power behind these victories
is the spirit of the nation.
We are proud to be a part of
this nation...
...which expects from us
a new victory.
Just as great Atatürk has pointed
out in his speech to the youth...
...there's only one thing
we need to know.
The strength we need, is in the blood
that flows through our venes.
My valiant children,
l wish you all success!
Where are you?
What are you looking around?
-l'm looking for my friends.
-Are you nuts or what?
-Baby?
-Kenan.
Don't kiss me in front of
so many soldiers.
He's one of us.
-Did you see Arzucan?
-l did.
-What? Great!
-Come on!
Can l ask you some thing?
Go ahead!
Was the guy who came to your
visit your boy friend?
We're engaged and will get
married after the service.
Really?
-l wish you all the best.
-Thanks. You too.
-Tom Cruise.
-Dursun?
-l have something for you.
-What is it?
-l wish you the best.
-Thanks Dursun.
l will wait till eternity.
The general's daughter.
Listen! Don't get out...
...unless you're ordered too, oK?
-Yes, sir. Sergeant?
-What?
l wanted you to know that l've
learned many things from you.
-Well, l hope so.
-Thanks for everything, Demir.
