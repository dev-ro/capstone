He is the tornado that is
going to lash in Kerala.
Don't let him hearyou.

He has many fans.
Loo k, he's taking photo.
Com e.
Let's go.

'That's enough.'
Salam, did you reduce the number of

Because you are our favourite team.

[Teaching bad words in Malayalam]
'Get lost you swine!‘
'Swine!‘

-Which language?

Why are you laughing?
Is it that bad?
What if! use it on referee?
Yes. You can call the referee.
I can call you also.
I know other swear words to
call you people.
Isn't it?
'MONIFERE!‘
No...no...
I am the Manager here.
Monifere is the manager of opposite team.
'Now you say some other words
in your language.‘
[Speaks in Yoruba]
'That's a lot.'
Manager, your phone is ringing.
- 'Aslam Alaikum'
-Wa'alaikum Salam
'Majid, didn't you get up yet?'
'Come fast.
The girl has to go to college.'
Will you be there?
'l'll be there at Alvi's shop.'
Okay
'We can come back soon if we go early.'
'Make it fast.'
Manager, do you want coffee?
No coffee.

Have one black tea and you can
go to toilet smoothly.
Okay. I will get it
No it's okay.

After marriage, she would
either be my friend or enemy.
- Good luck Manager.
-Yes, good morning.
- Majid, what happened?
- Nothing.
-Are you going to the 'Madrasa (school)'?
-Yes.
Mother, lam going.
'Aslam Alaikkum.‘
Of course.
Make it hot.
'Then make it in the induction stove.'
Why are you here when there
is a guest at your home?
Oh, you think you are that smart?
l have the rights to advice you
or even give you a tight slap.
Today I might get someone
to slap me hereafter.
- Really?
-Yes
From where?
From 'Kuttipuram'.
Nasser Brother brought this proposal.
Let me go and see.
You please pray for me.
You tell this to your
Mother yourself.
You please tell him also.
You ought to tell them these things.
l have told to my dear ones already.
'Aslam Alaikum'
You take the glass when you come there.
l have to hurry.
Or else she will get late to college.
God, please get him the right girl soon.
Nasser Brother had called.
Have to go and
meet a girl in 'Kuttipuram.‘
Let me go and see first.
I will settle the bills next month.
What are you guys doing here?
What?
ldiots, it's not his marriage.
We are just going to meet the girl.
You have done that several times.
Do you knowthat?
Stop behaving like kids
when you see a car.
See, l have got to tell you something.
Just like howl arrange a marriage,
I knowto cancel it also.
Don't make me angry.
So my son, do one thing.
Just come outside.
Until your marriage gets over,
I will be there in front of you.
You sit whereveryou want.
Just find me a girl.
Get inside the car.
Didn't you tell your Mother?
Don't attend the call.
She is simply calling.
'Tell Kunjippa not to come home
without paying the electricity bill.'
lt's regarding the electricity bill.
Didn't I tell you not to pick up the call.
Now go and pay yourself.
Hey, did I arrange yourwedding also?
No. I found the girl myself.
Thank God!
I am relieved.
'Allah!‘
Dude, don't close the door.
I have to get out.
Hey, that will do.
Come.
Do tell them that
lam younger than you.
lnfront ofthe girl itself.
I will say all that accordingly.
That's my duty and not yours.
You come.
So when l was doing graduation,
he was in class 10.
So?
Nothing.
I was just thinking.
Time passes quickly.
l was thinking he has become
old enough to get married now
Or else I will get them married.
In which college is the girl studying?
She is in MES.
Bsc. second year.
It's not like old times.
These days girls insist on studying.
After graduation, she wishes to go
to Delhi or Hyderabad to do Phd.
Herfriends are all there.
You don't need to worry about that.
Majid will take care of
that after marriage.
Hyderabad and Delhi won't
be an issue for him.
He brings people even from Africa.
So Majid, what do you do?
Today didn't start off good.
Two yellow cards.
On top ofthat all offside positions.
Did the referee say anything?
Cheating won't happen in penalty kick.
I hope we directly reach penalty kick
without eitherteams scoring goals.
We can win by luck at least.
I am scared of penalty kick.
It's not just you.
It's the same with all Messi fans.
Game is over. I was counting
on luck till the last moment
'...since both the teams are
at the goal margin 1-1...'
'...we will be deciding today's
winner through tie-breaker.'
Majid, aren't you straining the boys?
Don't you have match today?
I had to attend a wedding.
So had gone there.
And I had heard a lot about
Samuel in your team.
He has stuff.
Once he gets used to sevens,
he will get better.
Please don't spoil him with
yourflattery and evil eye.
If we don't get the toss, Samuel
doesn't have to make the first kick.
I'll tell when to take.
Faizal, they should lose their
confidence seeing yours.
Be brave.
Guys be energetic.
Play well.
Where are you looking at?
'Awesome!'
'Samuel, play well.'

Where are you?
Where were you?
Have been calling for so long.
- What happened?
- Sudu fell down.
He fell down?
What happened?
Morning, he slipped in the bathroom.
Is that it?
Where is he?
It is notthat simple.
Bathroom pipe is broken.
l have called the plumber.
He requires a surgery.
There is a fracture on his ankle.
-Ankle?
-Yes. Ankle over this part.
I don't think surgery is necessary.
Doctors can say anything.
Surgeries are required
only in our body.
Not in their bodies.
These are imported bodies.
It's bad that he fell down.
No use in saying that now
We have to pay this bill.
Need AB+ blood.
Surgery is unavoidable.
-Where is he? Can I see him?
- He's in ICU
- What about the doctor?
- He is also there.

- Yes
Hold the baby
Was it embarrassing to ask her gold
for pledging soon after the marriage?
Have you people become close enough?
Now she will give whateverl ask.
Newly weds!
But get it back soon.
Lathif, 90% ofthe gold
pledged in this bank...
...would be that of women
married into this village.
For sure!
Among us only Muthu,
Kunjippa and l are married.
There is no one left if there
is any other emergency.
Even I also wish to get
married and pledge her gold.
But it's not happening.
- Majid...
-Yes
'Give me at least 2000 ru pees.'
'No way.
That was my bangle.'
Bring this when you come next time.
I hope I don't come again.
'Where's the manager?‘
Has he run away?
Shall we keep Nizam at the back?
Their forward player is playing foul games.
He will take care of him. Over.
Not a bad idea.
Keep Manoj for defense.
And Farooq for fonNard.
He is the best for that cheater.
Over.
Get into the ground
What's happening with
'Mohanbaghan' player?
Will we lose money?
He has the qualities of a club footballer.
l have told herthatl
won't come home tonight.
Poor guy.
No problem. He will be better for
the tournament at Kod uvally.
Will we get Mohanbagan player
for Perinthalmanna match?
No way. We won't get him
for Rs 5000/- over there.
I agreed to this one as the
match was at Areakode.
We have strong fan base there.
'Coming from Calcutta by learning
big lessons in football...'
'...the Mohanbagan player has entered the
7's ground in Kerala representing MYC.'
'The goal-keeper has been unable to block
his shot, and he has scored a goal.'
Yes!!!
Didn't I tell you to call
me when the drip gets over?
Why didn't you go and inform her?
Now she has gone mad at us.
What's the use of staying here nouf?
Are you both from same
place in Afghanistan?
No Sir. I am from Kabul and
he is from some other place.
Which college are they from?
- In which college are you studying?
- Calicut University?
No Sir. I am studying in 'Farooq College'.
They are from 'Farook College'.
Isn't this 7's game like a bullfight?
It did not happen while playing.
Then how else did it happen?
Police should be informed if it
happened in some street fight.
It happened in the bathroom.
By falling down.
Majid, how can you take
things so lightly likethis?
If it was on ground, there
would have been witnesses.
It is complicated since it
happened in a private space.
So what happened to him?
Elbow has been sprained.
Have put belt in the waist.
He needs to take rest for few days.
He will be able to walk in 2- 3
weeks, after physiotherapy...
...and also a minorsurgery on his leg.
And you call this as minor injury?
Did this actually happen in the bathroom?
Yes sir.
That's what happened when he fell down.
You can come to the hospital
and see foryourself.
We don't need an invitation for that.
lam not telling this to frighten you.
If he files a case in future,
that will become our negligence.
Migration is a sensitive issue.
Do you knowthat?
I know That's why I came in
person to explain everything.
That's fine.
You provide him treatment.
We will come forthe inspection
and make the report.
You can go now
Will you become a millionaire,
by the time season gets over?
Sir, don't sit on that chair
and tease poor people.
What does he think of himself?
'Wa-Alaikkum-Salaam
Here, keep it.
There is Rs 10,000/-
I don't have anything with me.
I got tensed when you
said you have taken loan.
But since it's from
your son, I am relaxed.
He wouldn't ask you to return it.
He won't ask.
But I will ask you.
I am not scared of you.
Jokes apart and please
get me a sponsor.
You win some more matches.
You will easily get sponsors.
We have reached quarter
finals at 'Alathoor'.
And have won at 'Manarcaud
and Areekode also'.
Had some hope. But that's
when this accident happened.
Anyway I am coming to the hospital.
I want to meet him.
Won't you be there?
I am little busy now
There would be physiotherapy
for 2 days after surgery.
That's how it is these days.
But not in his case.
Because his backbone
has been injured.
He will need proper rest for a month.
So, what's the plan?
Is he going to be here?
Or are youtaking him home?
If he's going to be here, I will talk
to the management and get a discount.
So?
We will think about it
and let you know
We cannot afford to keep him here.
It will cost at least 2 lakhs.
What shall we do now?
Since we can't afford to keep him here,
we must find another place soon.
What about the quarters?
Other players will look after him.
What are you saying?
Who will look after him there?
If we have brought a player to ourteam...
...we should treat him
like a family member.
Otherwise it's a shame.
Don't you remember Philip,
who died of dengue fever?
We should actually keep
a home nurse for him.
But we do not have money for that.
Let me tell you something.
He should be shifted
to one of our houses.
That's the only option left.
If we shift him to your house,
who will look after him?
l was talking about Majid's house.
Over there it's just Majid and his mother.
I will take him home.
We will think about other matters later.
Notjust that. We should think
about sending him back also.
Before he becomes a liability.
Is there any benefit in
informing the association?
If he was injured on the ground,
we could have asked for compensation.
But that's not the case here.
Anyway we should explain
all this to that poor guy.
-Come on...
-You explain this to him English
Bava, start.
Manager, I will get better soon.
I want to come and play.
Samuel, doctortold you need to take rest.
You cannot play.
Manager, I don't have
any money with me.
No problem.
We will see about that.
Even if you can play or not.
You take rest first.
Relax. Don't worry.
We all are there with you.
We will go to Majid's house
and you can take rest there.
Manager, I will get better soon.
I want to come and play.
Please.
I can still play.
Samuel, how can you cry like
a baby with a body like this?
(folklore song)
Brother, what happened?
Relax.
Don't worry.
And neighbours.
This is Majid's mother.
Why are you hiding at the back?
Come here.
Come
This is Majid's mother's friend.
Move aside kids.
Let him get some air.
Move back.
Kids, just move back.
Jamila, get something to drink.
We can give it to them.
You said the right thing now.
l have some work.
Majid, give money forthe ambulance.
Majid...
Doesn't he have any space
in his villageto play?
Why did he come here for that?
Just like our kids, they are
also mad about this game.
They are getting money for playing.
There are two others outside.
Just like him.
They have also come here
to play and make money.
They say Majid is theirmanager.
Poor Mothers!
As kids, when they go to
play, we would get worried.
What ifthey fall down and get injured?
It's the same even when they grow up.
This is why I sent my son to Dubai.
Who will take care of the expense?
How long will he be here?
I don't know. Has he ever
told anything to me before?
He tells me only after deciding
everything by himself.
Do you know how long it has been
since he called me 'Mother'?
Jamila, don't open your complaint-box.
Keep the rice in the oven.
Majid, what about his food?
Just give whatever is there.
Don't bother to take risk.
Can you recharge my mobile number?
Recharge?
Yes. On my phone.
Make the call from my phone.
[Speaks in Yoruba language]
Sudu, I am leaving.
There is a match tonight.
Call Mother if you need anything.
Beeyumma, take care of Sudu.
I will be coming late.
You don't have to say that.
Son...
Are you hungry?
Shall I take food?
No Mama. Not now
I am not hungry.
Okay I will get it now

What are you saying?
Don't make us lose the game
with your commentary.
-Should I change it?

It will help him to get better.
He is only looking after everything.
Majid, go and get some
fresh fish for curry.
What's happening with
Majid's marriage proposals?
Who will give girl to someone
who doesn't have a properjob?
And he is behind this stupid game also.
What do I do now!
We are talking about your manager.
We should get him married.
His smile looks very nice.
l have seen him talking to someone.
Mark it in my accounts..
Don't bother
'Not an elephant right!'
Jamila...
I heard someone has
come here from Uganda.
Yes.
Come in.
That's what! am doing.
Hello...
Are you injured badly?
I got to know everything.
I'll come through the entrance.
That's the manners.
Did you have food?
Breakfast?
Have to say in English itself.
Doesn't even know Malayalam.
How will he understand English then?
Didn't I say he would be
here, when we sawthe col/if?
What's it?
He stamped on the cow-dung.
That's it!
It has to answer nature's call.
Will you do it?
Nair, is there milk?
Let's have milk tea.
There is no milk in the cow
She is going to give birth.
Hello Sudu, how are you?
[In Hindi language]
Uncle, he is not a Bengali.
He is from Sudan.

Then you repeat the same thing in English.
Yes. I will.
Hi.
How are you?
Hope you like our village and this house.
We will pray for you to get better.
Don't tease me.
He will think you are teasing him.

Move back.
Give him space.
'I hope he doesn't fall on Samuel.'
Thank you Sir.
Super Sir.
Hejust called you 'sir'.
Aren't you happy?
l knowthatyou are pulling my leg.
I did it for entertaining this man.
So don't make fun of me.
Majid, I got to know about it.
Will come and see him.
He thinks he's Barcelona's manager.
My wife had prayed to give Majid
someone to give him company.
Neverthought it would
turn out to be like this.
You should have clearly mentioned
in the prayerto give him a wife.
That's correct!
Uncle, when did you reach?

 just reached.
Go and get two cups of tea.
It's not good to see
when guests come home.
Hello, what's up?
Rajesh, in English what is

Classmates!
Yes, classmates.
They are all my classmates.
Your classmates?
'Ladies, come and have tea.'
Come and have tea.
Oh! There's cow dung over here.
Majid Brother, this is my husband.

- Single flip.
- Okay.
Dude, why is he calling you?
Put it in speaker-mode.
Hello.
What's going on, dear?
Going good.
What happened?
lam not getting time to come there.
When someone from
the sport's world gets injured...
...isn't it my responsibility as a sports
loverto come and meet him?
But couldn't make it.
l was busy with the games.
Even yesterday Majid was saying
that you are being missed.
So, how's Samuel nouf?
'He's alright now
Getting better.'
If you need any players, let me know
'Heard that you are looking for players.'
No thanks.
We have players with us.
Then it's alrig ht.
Okay bye.
'Walaikkum Aslam'
What's his problem?
It's because of his evil-eye
that Sudu fell down.
- That's right.
- His love for sports it seems.
Babu, l have a match
at Cherpulassery today.
Can you give that Kingsley
if you don't have match today?
No use in getting a random player.
I also have players like that.
He is not a random player.
He is the best player!
Four thousand rupees?
Don't mention the rate to him.
After seeing his game,
I'll pay accordingly.
Okay. Thank you.
'Allah!‘
'Get out fast.'
'Make it quick.'
'Aslam Alaikkum!
On the way home?'
- There is a guest in your house.
-Who?
Majid's player who fell
down the other day.
'Yes...
 was told.
Aslam Alaikkum'
'Wa'alaikkum Salam'
No...
Why? Are you an Argentinean fan?
No. Never.
Not like India.
Not like that. Actually there
is no world cup for sevens.
lfthere was, we would
have been the champions.
What is in a world cup without Ansari's
announcement and bamboo gallery?
Doctor, he has been sneezing lately.
It might be due to the new environment.
'-Aslam Alaikkum
- Wa'alaikkum Salam'
What happened to your phone?
I tried calling yesterday also.
He seems a bit feverish.
'Hasn't it been 4-5 years?
There is no use in repairing it.'
Make him breathe in steam.
Need to get a new mobile.
Mother, we are leaving.
- Have tea and go.
- No need of tea.
They came to check on Sudu.
Come inside.
Come and please sit down.
Yes, I will sit.
How are you?
Majid is still the same.
What shall we do?
lsn't he old enough to consider
him as his 'own father'?
He is not his own father, right?
When he died, everyone
forced me to remarry.
Didn't I come back, when!
sawthat Majid was unhappy?
Still, why is he doing like this to me?
Do one thing.
Ask him to live here now onwards.
Poor man.
Doesn't he need a retirement life?
Where is he residing?
He works as a security
guard at some place.
He says there is facility to stay there.
God only knows.
Stop crying.
There is meat at home.
I will get it.
Father
- Jamila...
-Yes
Aren't you staying here tonight?
l have not come here to stay.
lfl don't go, Velayudhan
will have to go instead.
He is not well.
Shall I pack your dinner?
- Do you need money?
- No
'-Aslam Alaikkum
- Wa'alaikkum Salam'
- Majid?
- What happened?
Majid, he has high temperature.
You go and get some vehicle.
We can take him in the morning.
No. His condition looks bad.
He had burning fever.
It was 1:30 am, when I got up
hearing his mumblings.
And we took him directly
to the hospital.
And he was taken to the ICU.
What did the doctor say?
Is it the normal fever?
There are different types
of feverthese days.
So many types of fever!
Is there any meeting happening here?
All of you move aside.
Everyone go.
lt's collector's order.
— Majid.
— What is it?
Dude, over here.
- Come here.
-What?
I need to knowyour
opinion on something.
What is your opinion about
Neymer leaving Barcelona?
Why can't he go? How long
should he wait there?
Why shouldn't he go to
a club with better payment?
In that case, Nissar has given
Rs 5000/- to Samuel as advance.
Everyone go out.
Mother, please go outside
Everyonejust go out.
Com e.
Sudu, did Nissar give you money?
How many Nissar's do you
know otherthan him?
Answer me, you cheat.
What?
Did he give you Rs 5000/- before
you fell in the bathroom?
Yes. But he said...
Don't talk.
Manager, just wait.
Shut up!
Manager, just listen...
You took his money, cheated
me and changed the sides..
...and when you got injured,
l have to carry the burden.
If you want to play with him,
go and stay at his house.
Aren't you ashamed to eat from
my house and lie here likethis?
Aren't you ashamed?
Your shit which I tidied up
is cleanerthan your mind.
Just wait.
You don't know me.
I will burn your passport.
I want to see
how you are going back!
What's happening here?
Do you want us to call the police?
What's happening here?
'Stop..stop...'
What's happening here?
'You ask Nissar about it.'
Just wait.
Tell me clearly what the problem is.
Things won't work out by shouting.
He is blabbering something.
I don't know about it. Ask him.
This cheat went behind
my playerand bribed him.
And when he got injured, he
wants me to take care of him.
I don't need to do so.
He's making baseless accusations.
He gave Rs 5000]-
le team is double strong.
Then why did you give him money?
These people always need money.
So when he asked, I helped him.
And nowthis has backfired me.
If my players need money,
I know to give them.
Oh really! The entire world
knows that you are broke.
That's why he is trying to
put his burden on me now
Don't talk nonsense.
Nissar, I understood that
you were helping him.
Since you have admitted that
you have given money...
...we are smart to understand
what has happened here.
How easily have you taken his side nouf?
So now, l have to take care of Samuel.
I don't need to look after him.
Majid...come here...
I understood what he has done.
But Nissarwon't take responsibility
of him, if we say that.
As per the documents, you
are Samuel's sponsor.
So wherever he is, you
are responsible for him.
So there is no use in
fighting in the street.
Do one thing.
Give a complaint to the association.
I will take care of the rest.
For now, go to the hospital
and take care of him.
We shouldn't run behind
the game to make money.
We should make money to play the game.
Think about that.
What happened to you?
We are not taking him home this time.
He will be here,
whatever be the expense.
Latheef, inform the doctor.
Latheef, you stay there.
You are not the one to decide that.
You want to leave him like this and go?
Not possible.
l have looked after him till now.

 knowto do the same here after also.
Mother's have reached so far
by cleaning up your dirty mess.
Don't forget that.
He's always like this.
Just concerned about his own life.
Doesn't want to know
the pain of others.
Son, when Sudu gets better,
lwant him back in my house.
Did you hear that?
Latheef, ask doctor if he's
ready to get discharged?
This time, we are taking him home.
Medical certificate alone won't do.
Let it be. Just check when
you can get the ticket.
Majid, this is not a normal ticket.
He needs facilities to lie down and go.
Which means first class.
And the accompanier has to come back.
Tell me the rate of an inexpensive ticket.
Anyway he has to be sent back.
I will check that.
But first settle the cash
for their tickets to India.
I had told you not to ask it now
Season has only started.
'MYC Accode sponsored by Airlines Travels!'
Get some big sharks for that.
We are just small fish.
Have tried that a lot.
Won't work out.
You tell me the cost.
For one ticket itself, it will cost
around Rs 1,50,000/-
Rs 1,50,000/—?
Okay
Thank God, there was
no one inside this.
Someone is just getting better.
Tell them to put cloth pegs on it.
Majid, what about my gold?
This is all! have got now
What else should I say?
I had told that I would return
the money when season gets over.
Does your wife wants to
wear the entire ornaments?
She's not insisting.
But her relatives will ask if
she doesn't wear any ornaments.
lsn't itjust the engagement?
Let them announce the marriage date.
For marriage, I will need the entire gold.
Whether the season gets over or not.
The gold craze of women
are making things hard.
It's because ofthis 'craze' that
we get their gold for pledging?
That's also correct.
Don't you knowthat
I don't have money?
You roll in some cash
and I will do the same.
Please tell if you
have any other idea.
Promise me that you won't get tensed.
Yes please.
We are going mad here.
Can't we think about it in this situation?
Majid...
Just forget what! said.
Take it as an elder's advice.
Brother, aren't we footballers?
Even if we are losing, we hope for
a draw until the last minute.
Even if it's impossible, we make
ourselves believe it will happen.
Whenl stop believing so,
I will stop this madness.
Yes Sir.
'You need to come to the station.'
-I will come now
- Inspector is waiting for you.
'Make it fast.'
It's from Police Station.
Need to go there.
What's the problem nouf?
You be here.
Latheef and I will go.
Why are you leaving me out ofthis?
If anything happens, someone should
be there to handle things outside.
Okay then.
You people go.
Sir? Where is the Sub Inspector?
Sir, I am Majid.
Haven't you brought some
foreigners without informing us?
They are my players.
I am team MYC's manager.
l knowthat.
You are not the only manager here.
Others have reported to me.
l have seen that. But you should
inform us when you do so.
FRRO has given permit to accommodate
them anywhere in Kerala.
Then what's the need of Police here?
They just know to check
the passport and visa.
And if anything happens aftenNards,
it becomes our headache.
Sir, what's the problem?
Hello, have you reached?
Will be there in 10 mins.
Sir, what about us?
Just be here.
I will come now
You haven't understood its seriousness.
Will explain afterl come back.
- Sir
- Let's go to one place.
- Hi brother
- Hello
'- How is your leg?
- My leg is fine. Thank you.'
You send a watch for him.
Get a foreign wrist watch itself.
Don't forget it.
'lnshah Allah'
Dad, what about my tablet phone?
Don't fall down with the
mobile in your hand.
l have told him to get a watch foryou.
Boys will look good
when they wear a watch.
When you go home,
everyone will ask for it.
Don't give it to anyone.
My husband used to be like that.
When someone says its good, he
would immediately give it to them.
Have you started in the morning itself?
Jamila, you shouldn't say so.
How long can I keep looking at herface?
She is always on the mobile phone.
Majid, where are you?
Shouldn't we go for match?
I am at Police Station.
Why did Nissar report the case so soon?
Nissar???
What case???
Heard a rumourthat he
would make Sudu give a...
...case against you, for exploiting him.
Don't scare me.
lsn't he with us always?
What complaints does he have nouf?
Then it's good.
Listen, I want cash.
Adjust with that.
Let me know if it's
not sufficient.
Don't fill the tank full.
Rajesh is simply telling
rumours to scare me.
He is saying Nissarwill make
Sudu give complaint against me.
Just ask if someone had come
home when we were not there?
- Should I ask?
-Yes.
You ask her.
Mother, this is Latheef.
Son, what happened?
Did anyone come home to meet Sudu?
His Sudan friends had come.
It was nice to see them
talking and playing.
What happened?
Just wanted to make sure that
they found the right house.
Did you give them snacks with tea?
Don't teach me how to treat guests.
I know that Mother.
Some Sudani's had gone home.
That would be our players.
Where did the Inspector go?
Eat. It's good for health.
Chew it slowly.
I have removed the stones
from Aval (Flattened rice)
What ifthere is anything left?
Yourfriend Majid likes it a lot.
- Manager likes it?
-Yes.
Lucky Manager!
He will be managerto you.
But to me, he is my son.
A mother shouldn't be saying this.
I wish he becomes sick
and lie here like this.
At least then he would need me.
Mamma, don't cry.
Samir, what about the match at Manjeri?
Waiting for more information. Over.
Sir, when will Inspector come?
He will come now
Sir, it's been hours.
Can you call him?
Policemen do not sit
at office and work.
You should have thought about
it while doing the crime.
God, we haven't done any crime.
Inspector asked us to wait.
Could have stopped worrying if
he had told what the issue is.
Can we leave saying there
is another urgency.
They haven't filed the case.
No. They will irritate us.
For no reason, they would play
the law game and get us stuck.
We can pretend as if we know nothing.
After all it's our need.
- Didn't you go?
-You had told us to wait.
So you should be careful when
you do things like this.
Made us wait for no reason.
We could have asked earlier
and gone home long time ago.
So Majid...
You should be careful about such things.
Understood?
Majid, be nice to Sudu.
What if something happens nouf?
I meant be nice and don't pester him.
You go home.
lwill take care of it.
Okay Bye.
I will text you.
You sleep.
No. I am okay.
You sleep.
Take rest.
Did you take medicine?
Yes. Mamma is very strict.
Do you want rice?
I am going to eat.
No. You go.
Manager...
I am sorry.
I didn't know.
No problem Samuel.
He is very bad.
You gottrapped in it. I know
You take rest.
I know you have spent so much money.
Whenl become fine, I will
give you back the money.
I will get a newjob then.
Money will com e.
Even I don't have money.
Everyone else gives me money.
I knowyou also don't
have money now
We will see about it.
I am glad that you
spoke about that now
But I feel guilty for making you say so.
I don't want you to understand.
That's why I spoke in Malayalam.
For my relief.
You take rest.
Hide it or else Mother will see.
Tell him to finish it fast.
Isn't he a patient?
I will have the other half.
I will whack you, if you drink
alcohol inside my house.
Manager has a surprise for you.
Sorry for what happened in the hospital.
- Thank you manager.
- Welcome
Looks like he drinks well.
Did you see his excitement?
Kunjippa!
Mother is coming.
Manager, where are you going?
-What are you doing?
- Sorry.
Why are you doing so?
Then you lie down here and lick it.
Nothing. His medicine bottle
fell down and got broken.
God, what shall we do nouf?
That's alright.
I will get a new one.
You move back.
I will clean it.
No need.
I will clean it.
What's going on here?
Sudu, what happened?
- What happened?
- Nothing. It's all my mistake.
It's good. You look
like a gentleman now
Don't! look good othenNise?
You mean I look good only in this shirt?
Not in the other one?
Both look good.
I have a selection camp.
Selection cam p?
For ourteam?
I am going to select a girl for marriage.
Girlfriend? For me?
Do you have?
Do you have girl friend?
Yes. I have.
But she left me. Looking
for new one on Instagram.
It's very difficult for us to get someone.
lam going.
All the best.
Thank you.
Do pray for me.
I hope it's a good proposal.
Your name?
Fathima Nazrin.
What's your name?
Majid Rahman.
I have got only Mother at home.
Shall we discuss about it after
I am okay with this proposal?
Yes. Sure. You are right.
I stopped after 12th grade.
Is it a reason to quit studies?
Due to certain circumstances I had to quit.
Did you quit after passing 12th grade?
I didn't pass.
That's why I quit studies.
'He used to study we

.'
'Doesn't he look cute?'
Didn't you sleep yet?
What about the selection camp?
What?
I will come inside.
Fought with the referee.
Why did you fight?
What was the problem?
Problem is the referee.
That swine did this.
Manager, why are you doing this job?
You don't have money.
You have mamma, friends, neighbours...
Why is yourfather not
living here with you?
I know
He is your step-father.
Nobody is there to listen to me.
Do you knoiAf?
I was serving food for
my Mother's wedding.
And my schoolmates were laughing at me.
But she remarried and left me.
New marriage.
I have so many problems in my life.
I am not happy.
There are wounds in my heart.
I knowthat you are also not happy.
Your dream is to become
the best football player!
No manager.
My dream is much bigger than that.
I miss everyone.
Mamma and Pappa dying...
War...
War?
Yes. Civil war.
My two sisters and I live with Grandma.
There is no food or money.
I want to escape from this world.
To a better world.
Better world?
Better world.

We should have roasted
Nissar verbally also.
He knows only to talk.
We should reply him with our game.
Give them all the leg piece of chicken.
Eat till your stomach is full.
Rajesh, get a grilled chicken
parceled for Samuel.
Anyway, I was so determined today.
Even though he doesn't know
to play, he knows to talk.
He was talking about the food.
I got tensed seeing the low
ground support inthe beginning.
But we made it at the end.
Ground support should be earned.
That's heroism!
What a statement!
Where did you get so much wisdom?
Every man has his own destiny.
Zidan and I were destined to be a coach.
[Players teasing Majid]
'Not even married.
But he always gets calls'
Finish it fast.
I have to rush home.
What happened?
What's the issue?
Don't know what happened.
He has been crying.
We won the game.
Majid, did he say anything?
Does he have some sort of body pain?
Majid, you call the doctor.
I am losing everyone.
My sisters are all alone.
We are all there with you.
Mother, myself...
Everyone is there with you.
We can arrange it tomorrow morning.
Please come.
Did he sleep?
I don't think he can sleep anymore.
'lnnalillah'
That won't be necessary.
On the 3rd day of death, there
would be some ceremony everywhere.
He is not a Muslim.
He is a Christian.
lfthere is anything, we can do it here.
For his peace of mind.
He is upset today.
Let's go.
Look for a cheap flight for next week.
He can travel alone.
Doctor's certificate is there.
You check for the cheapest
flight and call me.
I will check and call.

'What kind of fish do you
need for the function?'
Mention the name ofthe fish.
It could be any fish.
You can cut anything to pieces.
Close the tap.
You are wasting water.
You want water?
Ask Mother for water.
You are wasting water.
What's he saying?
I don't understand anything.
Majid, has he gone mad?
Sudu, I have closed it.
You go home. Your Mother
has called you twice.
- It's just water.
- Don't shout. People will hear.
Your Mother is calling you.
Just go home.
Hell with his English
'Majid, these African's
will leave after few days.'
Is this Majid's house?
Is he at home?
Come with me.
Looks like they are not Majid's friends.
Majid, you have visitors.
May I know who you are?
Yes. What happened?
Are you the Majid mentioned
in this article?
Yes. What happened?
Need to give them a report.
Is he there inside?
In the backyard, with the kids.
- He is there in the backyard.
-Can you call him?
He has to walk with the cane.
Let's go overthere.
Shall we go there?
Doctor has told him to go for walks.
He shouldn't always sit.
His leg has to get better.
Majid, you thread this needle.
Son, they have come to see you.
I am fine.
Thank you.
We are Government officials.
We are here to ask some
details about you.
It's just for our Government records.
That's all.
Yes.
Please ask.
-Are you really from Nigeria?
- Yes
Samuel Abiola Robinson.
I thought your name was Sudu.
Are you a refugee?
Sure.
But it's a Malayalam newspaper.
Which is your native?
Son, just thread the needle.
Original passport is at
team owner's office.
What's this?
This is the scanned copy.
Robinson...
Do one thing.
Bring the original passport to
our office on Monday morning.
Bring him also.
Okay?
What's it?
Your passport is not there in your bag.
No. There only I kept it.
Come and check.
-What's it?
- Passport is missing.
Newfashion!
My father never had passport.
But he kept coming and going to Karachi.
Without any passport, he
led a good life and died.
He has been to many countries also.
Passport!
If it was brought here, it won't
go missing without my knowledge.
Will get it for sure
if we look carefully.
Samuel, try to remember.
I was in hospital.
You call Latheef or Rajesh and ask.
Me? Why should I take?
Did you take it when he
was brought to the room?
Do one thing.
Call Latheef.
He is the one who took him to hospital.
He will have it.
It won't go missing.
Itook it from his room
to give in the hospital.
Why did you give it there?
What are you saying?
He is a foreigner.
So they would ask.
Leave it.
Bring it back.
His ticket has been booked.
Who was with him when he got discharged?
You and Muthu?
What are you talking?
Then it will be in hospital.
You go to the hospital.
I will come there.
It's in the hospital.
I will go and check.
It's not here.
We have returned it.
You might have kept
it somewhere else.
Don't you understand what! am saying?
Had it been here, we would have
called you and returned it.
Rajesh...
It's not here.
Did you check there carefully?
- Is it there in that?
- No
There is no need to get worried.
We can apply for a
duplicate passport.
Is that possible?
I don't have the education to go to Delhi
and apply for a duplicate Nigerian passport
Even I don't know to take the
duplicate of a foreign passport.
But let's see.
How is it possible?
I am not like you.
I have to take care of my business.
And he will have to come with me.
Lodge a complaint in the police station.
And give an advertisement
in the newspaper.
Do this and come back.
We will do the rest then.
How long will it take?
Anyway it won't take more than a month.
How do you want to go to Delhi?
By flight or train?
If you book now, we can
save some money.
Okay.
Let me see.
Send me a sample content
of the complaint.
lwill send.
Write your name and details on this.
I will write my address.
Complaint to the police.
Regarding the missing passport.
No duplicates.
This won't take long.
We will get it soon.
I want to go home with
the original passport.
Get me the original passport.
Idiot, we are taking the duplicate,
since we couldn't find the original.
You didn't keep it safe.
It's not my mistake.
I want to go home with
my original passport.
Get me the original passport.
I won't go home without it.
Don't go home!
I am trying to help you.
You go and find it yourself.
I can't do it.
Why are you standing here?
Samuel, look here.
Duplicate passport won't be a problem.
I enquired at the travel agency.
It's easy.
My passport is fake.
What?
My passport is not a real one.
Oh my God!
I will be put injail.
I am afraid.
You won't believe.
My life is not so easy.
You don't know my story.
My life is not like yours.
You won't understand it.
Me, my grandma and my sisters do
not live in a place like yours.
We live in a refugee settlement.
With thousands of people.
There was no ration.
We had to buy everything.
Food, water...
Everything.
I was struggling to make my sisters happy.
We kids played football
as long as we wanted.
Because while playing we
forgot that we were hungry.
It was difficult to get a job.
We roam around.
Trying to make some money.
To feed ourfamily.
But, it was never enough.
I wanted to give my family a better life.
But we didn't have many choices.
All we had was football.
Some of us were lucky to
go to better countries.
To play football and make some money.
So I tried my luck.
The coach was very helpful.
Thank God.
I was lucky.
I got selected to India.
Everyone was happy.
Grandma and my sisters.
But I was a refugee.
I had no passport.
The only way was
to get a fake passport.
And it was expensive too.
I had to make more money.
I worked hard.
I worked day and night.
I moved from one street to another.
Selling different things.
I didn't want to lose the opportunity.
I could pay half only.
The other half, I have to pay from here.
I still owe him money.
My sisters have no one now
They have only me.
I have to go back somehow
Help me, manager
Please.
'Do something.‘
It's an odd twist!
'Refugee Camp in Vazhayoor - I gave that
title to make it sound ornamental.‘
I thought this title and an African's
photo would gain attention.
Why did you write so recklessly?
It has badly affected him.
There is nothing much in the content.
It's just ornamental.
I have a special interest
in these refugee stories.
I am the one who made up stories
about Bangladeshi migrants.
I mean I wrote it.
We need to send the poor guy back.
Is it any better portraying him as
a refugee? If so tell about that.
I don't know about the legal procedures.
I will do one thing. Will
give the contact of a person.
Just ask him about it.
He has actively participated
in Rohingya, Srilankan issues.
Just meet him.
He might be of use.
Don't make up more stories.
Let the poor guy go home.
-Just give me his number.
- Okay
Sudu,
 have kept the food here.
And there is salt over here.
There are some coins here.
If someone comes, give it.
'Jamila, we will miss the 10:30 bus.'
Son, we are going to Mampuram
mosque to pray foryou.

He will get a refugee card
from Delhi UN center.
But that's a big trap.
Refugees from other countries can't work or
travel here. Won't get a place to stay also
There are so many issues like this.
Laws do not allowthem to do jobs here.
These restrictions would eventually
lead to poverty and starvation.
There are so many Rohingya
families living here.
We distribute the materials and
food provided by different NGO's.
In this scenario, your friend
could be sent to thejail...
...as an illegal immigrant, since
he doesn't have a passport.
Other option is to go to UN center and get
a refugee card without informing police...
...and later find ways to escape from here.
But, that's not a sure bet.
What were you doing?
- Come and see.
-What?
Oh God, my wall!
No problem.
It's beautiful.
'Bismillahi Rahmaniraheem'
We have come to take the Nigerian.
Don't create a scene.
Call him.
Sir, he is not well.
-Where is he?
- In that room.
Sir, he has passport.
We can't help you.
You can contact the police superintendent,
before we take further actions.
Did you take the passport for
sending money to Sudu's village?
I had given my ID card
for sending money.
I haven't taken the passport there.
We can search there also.
So as to avoid confusion.
Do you have the phone number
of money transfer office?
Didn't I tell you when you
phoned that it's not here.
Not letting me sleep also!
Didn't I tell you that
it wouldn't be here?
It was not needed here.
Majid Brother...
Us? Don't blame us.
Aren't you equally responsible?
Weren't you the ones who took it
to hospital and other places?
I know what you are trying to imply.
You want to pin it on me.
That's not what he meant.
That's what he meant.
None of you will get into any trouble.
If anything happens it will affect only me.
I am his sponsor.
Majid, we are also worried and sad.
He is our friend too.
What does he think of himself?
Apparently the passport was with you.
You should have been careful.
But it's not right to blame him alone.
It has been a big mistake.
We are all to be blamed for it.
We are playing with his life.
Notjust his life.
It's two lives. Mine also.
If anything happens I will be in trouble.
You all won't have a problem.
God, Police!
Uniform shouldn't be put here like this.
You should wear it.
Don't stop.
I am not stopping.
If any problem arises it will affect me.
Should I stop or not?
Say something.
Stop the vehicle.
Stop it or else they will come behind us.
Why can't you stop ifthe police ask you?
Is that how you drive?
I noticed, but he didn't.
He drove the auto.
He drove it.
But the auto is mine.
Get the license from Police station.
Where are you all coming from?
- We had gone to money...
- Say without smirking.
Do you have any illegal money dealings?
R.C book and other documents.
Everything is clear.
Who said it's clear?
Are you the one to decide that?
- Insurance paper...
- What insurance paper?
All the documents are clear.
Check the vehicle.
See ifthere is indicator and mirror.
- Isn't everything okay?
-Yes.
Is there First Aid inside?
Go and get it.
Get the first aid.
First 'Air' what?
Sir, what is this?
Can we go?
I am going to fine you
for overloading also.
There were not many people inside.
'Don't you remember me?'
Majid...
I just remembered.
Majid had told me to keep it safely.
Thanks a lot Sir!
It is 19.5 kgs.
I have checked it.
Then take it.
Let's go.
Majid, just come with me.
I had told my son to
send a watch for Sudu.
He has given it to someone.
Butl haven't got it till now
Who has it?
One of his friends.
He is not attending the call also.
Don't worry.
Let me call him.
Watch will reach on time.
You go inside.
It's beautiful.
'Aslam Alaikkum.
Who's Beeyumma?'
I am coming straight from Dubai.
I have brought the watch.
Will pay for it when I come back.
Beeyumma's gift.
It's getting late.
Let's go.
Take care of Mother!
Bye guys.
Rajesh, take left from here.
Left? But, we need to go right.
Just take the left.
'Aslam Alaikkum'
'Wa'alaikum Salam'
Mother, get me something to eat.
I am hungry.
