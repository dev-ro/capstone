If you can't stand your lawful hubby
nah neh nah
Treat him to some deadly nightshade, 
mmm, yummy
nah neh nah
Add paprika for an authentic flavor
nah neh nah
He will be done for in eight hours, not later
nah neh nah
If you love your hubby very much
nah neh nah
Treat him to some home-made goulash
nah neh nah
I am leaving for a distant place
I am leaving for a distant place
a place no human arm can embrace
a place no human arm can embrace
Orphan am I, lonely as a cloud
Orphan am I, lonely as a cloud
I have no one to stand by my side
I have no one to stand by my side
My life, my days are filled with sorrow
My life, my days are filled with sorrow
My sadness will prevail, 
there is no hope for tomorrow
My sadness will prevail, 
there is no hope for tomorrow
