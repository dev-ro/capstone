Every day I see the illusion of love.
You would be surprised
at the percentage of...
I see those about to be disappointed,
those in the throes of disappointment,
and those who make an effort
to not be disappointed.
It's part of my job to see these things.
Sex, affection...
couples, families, love.
You learn about a lot of things.
Okay, everything looks fine.
Take her, for instance.
Do you know where
her children's father is?
Mm-hmm. Neither does she.
She spent years waiting
for the perfect love of her life,
only for it to arrive,
at last, frozen inside a tube.
And they... they look cute, don't they?
Okay, no.
There are so many people fundamentally
wrong about their own lives,
who, deceived, chase after a fairy tale,
settling for whatever they can find.
It's exhausting.
And it's all because they can't
accept the sad, simple truth..
Love, true love,
is, in the best of cases, unlikely.
Love is not for everybody.
It's the privilege of a chosen few.
And if youâ€™re lucky enough
to find it, you lose it.
Most of the time, it's better
to take it for what it is.
- Were you waiting for someone here?
- Uh, no. Sure. Sit down.
We must accept that it's fast.
We must make it fun.
And we have to learn that the best part
is that it ends as quickly as it begins.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay. Oh.
Wow.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
What? What?
I love you.
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?
Mm-hmm.
- Mmm! God, yes!
- Okay.
Mom! It's my fault
for giving you a key.
How do I look?
Hmm?
- Are you wearing white?
- Of course!
Won't the priest be offended?
Not at all! He loved the idea.
Is Clara here? What'd she say?
She thinks it's cynical
of me to wear white.
- It is, isn't it?
- What did Dad say?
Nothing, because it's bad luck.
He's not seen me yet.
What bad luck are you talking about?
You've been together 40 years!
Besides, you suddenly
believe in marriage...
You did it for your wedding.
We don't need to believe it.
We have empirical proof.
Ah...
Your grandpa would be happy to see me
getting married at last,
priest and all.
He died worried you girls
would go to hell
because you were born
out of wedlock.
Don't even worry about that,
we can still get there
for something else.
Oh! Take a shower!
You smell like a tavern.
Mmm, nice.
Besides, you need to try on
your maid of honor dress.
- That's why I'm in Los Angeles.
- No, I can't.
I have a patient and a delivery.
It's Saturday.
Mm-hmm! And some babies
are born on Saturday!
They're so rude, aren't they?
They interrupt my weekend.
Hey... Where did you sleep?
I went out last night
and stayed out.
I didn't know I'd be walking
into a tulle ambush this early.
- And you went out undressed...
- Not at first,
but that's where the evening went.
Mom and Dad can't get
married before you.
That's usually how it goes.
They're the weirdos.
It's also wrong that a woman
with your mind and your legs
has nobody to go to the wedding with.
What about last night's guy?
He wasn't even good for that?
He wasn't even good
for what I needed him to do.
You can't keep sleeping around
with guys
you don't even want to see to just get
your clothes back.
But for real, though,
there's no reason to see them again.
How do you know, if you leave at dawn?
I've been in love before.
I know what it is,
I know what it feels like.
And I can easily recognize what it's not.
That was a thousand years ago, sis.
Eight.
You have to try.
Why? Because I've reached
an age to just settle for whoever?
Because you need someone
to go places with you.
And if you don't get it together,
the bride won't rest
until she pairs you off with one
of the Guadalajara cousins.
And those guys are all
about "kissing cousins."
Find someone cute, man.
And if he's Mexican, well,
she'll consider it a wedding present.
Cute and Mexican.
Okay, then.
Come on, push! Push!
Okay.
There we go!
Thank you.
Congratulations.
You did very well.
- Is he okay?
- Yes, fine.
- Very well.
- Okay.
You got a brand-new baby boy, huh?
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.
My love...
Oh...
Hmm? What?
I'm just here to pick up the charts
for the next week.
I was just in the room
with you and Mrs. Pitanzas.
- I know. Mm-hmm.
- The delivery room.
Thanks.
What'd your boyfriend do?
Hmm? Excuse me?
Uh, or girlfriend. It's...
Well, someone has sent you
a million flowers.
They must've done something.
It's the... arrangements.
Right. Yeah. Uh... no.
No, no boyfriend.
No, these are sample centerpieces
for my parents' wedding.
Yeah, I have to pick one.
Maid of honor.
They're renewing their vows?
That's great.
No, no. Brand-new vows.
Yeah, they never got married.
They were hippies in the '70s,
and now that they've been
happy and together for 40 years,
they need fresh, new ways
to... rub it in.
I'm sorry.
- No, it's...
- Mm!
Yeah.
Hmm.
You're pretty.
Excuse me?
Are you Mexican in any way?
Ay, ay, ay. We're so late.
- We are so late.
- It's okay.
My mom's gonna kill me.
Oh, no, you don't need that.
We're crossing an international border.
Oh, yeah, I know. You're gonna need that
on the way back, but...
So, they don't care who comes in?
But we could be anybody!
No. They can sense that you're
a harmless soul.
Yeah, I mean, and that's
very accurate of them. I am.
But, you, on the other hand,
you could be...
What is... Come on!
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.
- Anything to declare?
- No.
- No.
- Go ahead.
Oh, hey. Yeah.
It's fine.
Thanks. Thanks.
And thanks for coming, by the way.
Thank you for inviting me.
There.
I'm driving on the way back.
Wow!
That's, uh...
That's one hell of a view!
Look at that.
Yeah, I bet you don't
have this in Australia, huh?
We do, it's just, like... It's nice to see
what comes second, you know?
Oh!
Um, oh, uh,
what's the name, again?
- Jacinta.
- Jacinta.
Yeah, your grandmother's name
was Jacinta.
- Uh-huh.
- And she was born in Sonora.
- Sonora.
- And she... Oh! Okay.
- Easy, easy.
- She, uh...
- met an Aussie in Texas.
- Aussie in Tex... Right, right. Okay.
We can give her an easier name,
if you like.
Can you handle Maria?
Please, be more condescending
while you're making ridiculous requests.
- Oh!
- Come on.
- Can you help me with that?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Okay. What?
Nothing.
No, you're just
a remarkable ugly woman.
- Aunt Claree!
- Bobs!
So nice to see you again!
- Oh, you brought a date!
- Yep.
- Mama's gonna be thrilled!
- What's up, man?
This is not gonna go up.
It will go up.
We don't want to be defeatist, child.
Okay, here we go. Big breath.
Yup. Ee! Yay!
Oh, thank you.
Hello!
I hate you so much!
You look lovely!
Hey, no. Let them out.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Okay...
- Ahem.
- Hello!
Hi.
He's not Mexican!
No, but he has a Mexican grandmother
named Jacinta.
Jacinta, yes, I did.
That's right.
- Asher. Hi.
- Yeah.
First few times I met the family,
I had a Mexican grandmother,
Timotea.
- Yes!
- I miss her very much.
Hey, he's very cute!
Thank you, you too.
Not fair, Dad. When will you learn
to speak Spanish like him?
As soon as your mom starts fasting
on Yom Kippur.
Good luck, Dad.
Now our roles are reversed.
Thank you, baby.
I , Eva, take you, Francisco,
as my husband, because...
Well, because you are
my best friend,
and just look
at what we've accomplished.
This house.
Our beautiful daughters.
Everything's perfect.
Because you were
involved in everything.
Oh, Mrs. Barron, I love you so much.
We have a wonderful story together.
I'll gladly spoil it all
by getting married.
The rings, dear.
To the official document
stating we're not bastards.
- It's like that?
- Mm-hmm.
Daniel?
I'm so glad to see you!
I can't believe you're here!
- Francisco.
- Same here.
- Daniel! Welcome!
- Congratulations!
You wanna make a run for it?
- Yes. Yes.
- Yeah?
Right.
Glad to see you, too.
Clara!
Clara!
- Daniel? Daniel!
- Hey!
What's up?
What's good? What's good?
Well, I saw Eva's announcement
on Facebook
and I decided to crash the wedding.
- I see.
- Sorry.
No, no. I couldn't send you an invite
because the email bounced.
Right... Yeah, I guessed.
- Yeah, you guessed?
- Yeah.
But you didn't guess
maybe I didn't want you here?
Say... when'd you come back?
The last Abby heard about you,
you were in Yucatan, right?
I was in Yucatan a few months
and then I went to Peru.
Oh...
Yeah, unbelievable. And then...
Well, I came back to Los Angeles about...
four months ago or so.
Ah!
Right. And you didn't tell anybody?
No, see, it's just that I don't...
I just don't...
I didn't know how...
I just didn't know how. I'm sorry.
Why are you apologizing?
You don't have to apologize to me.
Well, no...
You know what? Eh...
- Hi. Uh, I'm, Asher Grace.
- Oh, God.
- Hi, nice to meet you, Asher.
- How are you?
- Daniel, this is Asher Grace.
- Asher Grace.
You're a long way from home, aren't you?
- Well, Australia is...
- You're from Australia?
...four, fif...
17 hours away, yeah.
- Oh, wow.
- Well, he does...
He has, um, a Mexican grandmother
named Jacinta.
- Really?
- Yeah.
No, he doesn't.
No, he doesn't.
Nice try, though.
Well, he does speak great Spanish, though.
It's uncanny, yeah.
It's a pleasure. Really.
Same here. Thank you.
Anyway, we were just gonna, uh, see
what table we were gonna sit at.
- Um... yeah. Where are you gonna sit?
- Yeah.
I don't know, but since
I'm crashing the wedding,
- probably at your table.
- Oh, okay, yeah.
Maybe I'll take your seat!
I'm just kidding.
This guy, you know,
he's, like, deformed
This guy, you know,
he's, like, deformed
because of the accident,
exposed fracture.
Then he looks at me,
looks at the syringe,
and goes, "Mm, you know what,
Doc? It's not that serious."
He just walk...
Stands up and storms out of the clinic!
It was...
So, you're with Doctors Without Borders?
- Yeah.
- Ah.
And you like it?
Oh, I love it.
Yeah, you know,
I get to meet a lot of people,
see wonderful places.
I like to move around.
Of course you do.
Well, I really believe
that if you stand still too long,
then your life starts living you.
It should always be the other way around.
Oh! Ladies and gentlemen,
please hold your breath
for more "Life Reflections
with Adventure Daniel."
I'm serious.
Oh, I know, trust me.
You do not have to convince any of us
of how hard it is for you to stay put.
Play nice, Claridad.
What? I'm sorry.
No, I mean, you say the wrong thing,
he'll disappear for another decade!
There she goes...
No, seriously, I think it's wonderful,
all the things you've seen and done.
- Hmm.
- Mom is proud of you.
I'm just... I don't know.
I'm just very happy to be here now.
Mm!
I love this song.
I remember.
Get out of here, "you remember."
- It'll just be a sec.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
So, being a doctor,
is that pretty fun for you?
What?
Nothing, I'm just looking at you.
It's been a thousand years
since I saw you last.
Eight.
Eight.
Well?
You're much worse for the wear.
You look like an old man.
Okay, spit it out.
- What else? What else?
- What else?
No, that's it.
You look handsome.
You've always looked handsome.
You too. You look beautiful.
Always have.
- Always?
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah, always.
Even in my ladylike costume picked
by my Mom...
and Abby?
You look great, even hand in hand
with the little Australian boy.
- Don't start.
- What? No, it's not easy.
I mean, I'm serious!
Not every hunk can deal
with something like that.
And you're tremendous!
Such good looks!
Oh, Daniel...
You look the same.
- I do?
- Mm-hmm.
Where it matters, yes.
My butt, you mean?
I mean here.
It's one of my favorite spots
in the world, you know?
And you've not visited it in a long time!
Still, I miss it.
Liar.
Oh, God.
Pay no attention to this.
It has nothing to do with reality.
Come on.
I'm so sorry about all of this.
Don't... Do not...
Don't be silly.
We all have one of those. Come on.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
Hey!
Clara's probably up at the house.
Oh, no, I was looking for you guys.
Why is he back, you know?
All smiles! Hugging people!
I mean, we haven't even seen him
in years, decades, almost,
and suddenly he's still family?
It's just wrong.
But he's not... family, is he?
What?
He's not actually family, though, is he?
- You're disgusting. No!
- Well, I'm not.
Ah, good. No, I'm making sure
you're not disgusting.
If you... Because...
No, truly, I was...
Yeah, you know...
Do you want to... tell me about it?
Well...
Ahem. Hmm.
For a split second, he...
could've been my husband, and...
and then he just wasn't.
Got it.
Clara!
We should go.
- The blushing bride awaits.
- Yeah.
Clara, where were you?
- We were just talking.
- But where?
You warming up for the dance-off?
Don't practice too...
I want to see some...
- He's been stretching. Yeah.
- Thank you very much.
- I have indeed.
- You just wait and see.
Do I need to worry?
- Why?
- Behave yourself.
Good grief!
Come dance with us.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Is, uh, Dr. Barron in yet?
Does she know what this is regarding?
Yeah. Yeah, it's, um...
We work togeth...
Uh, occasionally we'll work together,
um, and she wanted to talk, uh, strategy.
You know what? Just go in.
Thank you.
Morning.
Hi.
Okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hey, so I was, uh...
I was thinking that maybe tonight
you and I could go on like a proper date,
you know, with dinner
and tablecloths and such.
Asher, you're really sweet, seriously.
Thank you so much
for coming to the wedding
and putting up with all the...
"Aah!" but, uh, yeah.
No, this is...
It's not happening.
Why not?
Uh, well, you work for me.
Yeah, well, I don't at all, actually,
so that's...
Still, I don't date
anyone in the hospital.
But we already dated.
- Am I wrong?
- No, that was just sort of like a...
emergency, you know?
Not a date.
Clara.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I really wish I liked you.
I really do, but...
I don't.
Why not?
Why not? Come on, let me know.
This is... No, screw the date.
I'm interested now.
- Okay, um...
- What's wrong with me?
Well, you're just...
You're not my type.
Oh, because I'm too attractive?
Gotta get this sorted.
You're not the first to say... No, no,
seriously, look at me.
You're not the first person
to say this to me.
Okay, fine.
- Many, many women.
- It's the... Crocs.
You wear Crocs
with cartoon pins in them.
I'm in Pedes. The kids like them.
Kids also like to eat
their own bodily fluids.
Okay, yeah, no, you're right.
The Crocs are gone.
Is that it? Done.
- Oh, they're gone? That's it?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
No, now there's the fact
that you're willing
to change your personality
to get a girl to like you.
Wow, that was easy. Um...
All right, yeah, no,
I , uh... I get it.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- It's about, um...
It's about that guy, right?
You wish you liked me, but I'm not him,
so therefore you can't.
Hey, why aren't you with him, hmm?
You know, apart from the fact that he's
a self-important arsehole,
which, I assume, only makes
him more attractive.
He's bad for me.
How so?
He leaves.
I thought you'd like that.
Saves you the trouble.
You don't know me.
I'm... I'm... Hey. I'm trying
to change that, Clara.
Let me.
Um, I have a patient. I'm sorry.
There it is.
Everything looks fine.
No, he's so handsome.
Isn't he?
Look, Beto.
Beto, look.
It's our little Clark.
- Clark?
- Like Superman.
He looks happy, doesn't he?
Doesn't he?
Beto? He looks happy.
You can't see anything.
Oh, he does look happy.
- Fine, he looks happy.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
I talk to him a lot, doctor, you know?
Like, when I'm frustrated,
or angry, or I just feel like...
So I talk to him and...
It's cool, because I feel
like I'm pouring my heart out.
The good thing is, he doesn't hear her.
It'd be inappropriate otherwise,
right, doc?
No, he does hear me. He doesn't take
after his Dad in that regards.
- Hi, sis.
- Are you at the bar?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
What do you mean, okay?
I'm at a bar.
But I'm going to hell.
- Stay a bit longer.
- Why?
Because I say so and I'm your sister.
What? What's wrong?
Are you crying?
Why'd he come back?
Hang in there. He won't stay long.
- I'm going home. Bye.
- No, no, no. Stay five more mi...
You leaving so early?
Hi!
- Hi!
- Hi.
- Hi!
- How are you?
I'm good!
Okay. Okay.
My sister is the best.
It's good to see you, too.
You really are pretty, aren't you?
Ohh... you're drunk.
No.
Yeah. Here.
There we go.
This is amazing!
Yeah. Oh, yeah, well, I...
I didn't do it, so...
Oh, yeah, I was gonna say,
it screams designer ex-girlfriend at me.
Mm. Your bedroom's weird.
It's like Martha Stewart got tired
when she got to the door.
Oh, you're one of those
really funny drunks.
Mm! Ho ho! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Here, come.
All right. Okay.
Mm. Just sleep.
Mm.
What?
I'm taking the couch.
- You're blue-balling me?
- Good night.
Seriously?
Sleep well, Dr. Barron.
Morning.
Morning.
Now, how you feeling?
Why did you bring me here?
You wouldn't tell me where you live.
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
It's okay. Come on.
Come here.
It's okay.
And... you know, maybe, I like you,
I don't know, a little bit,
something, I don't know.
Mm.
I'm sorry I'm being a jerk. It's just...
No, you have a knack for it.
It's that guy, Daniel.
I'm so pathetic. I have done nothing
but try to forget him since he left,
and then he shows up, and that's it.
All he needs to do,
appear, and I'm gone.
I get it.
- Do you?
- Yeah.
Ohh...
That's intense.
Yeah, right?
And this apartment.
Everything...
Some people never leave,
but they can make room for others,
the right others,
if you let them in.
If I let them in?
Correct.
What is this, then?
Is this not me letting you in?
Maybe. Admit that you like me.
Bruised egos are rough.
No, see, you like me. Say it.
Wow, look at this Aussie boy
lecturing me on love.
It's not a lecture.
But in reality, you're just fishing
for compliments.
- I am not fishing...
- "Oh, you're beautiful."
Thank you, yes, finally!
"You're just the most amazing Aussie
I've ever met!"
- Okay, okay...
- Yeah?
Okay.
I like you.
Okay.
Wow, I say I like you, and...
you immediately put out.
If I'd have known it was that easy...
- Shh, shh, shh.
- I would've just...
Stop talking.
Dr. Barron?
Hi. Um , I'm here to, uh,
pick up a file or something?
Lisa is just decorative
when it comes to you, isn't she?
Well, she's not exactly
high-tech security.
How are you?
- I'm all right.
- How was your day?
It was good.
Oh!
- Mm mm mmm! Tonight.
- Mm-hmm?
Dinner. Tablecloths.
All of the above.
- God, you are obsessed...
- Finally, hmm?
...with tablecloths.
They are the marker of civilization.
- Come on. You're coming.
- I'm not here tonight.
I'm going to my parents'
for a long weekend.
Oh, you're going to check
on their marital bliss, huh?
Uh, sorry, this is just a little...
- It's gonna be that much fun?
- No!
- Nothing's that much fun.
- We go once every few months,
we go to the beach,
and we play games.
My dad loves playing games.
It's really fun, actually.
It does sound fun.
It sounds very fun.
- I'd invite you.
- Would you?
- Uh, yeah, it's just that my parents...
- Okay. No, I'd love to go.
I have a little bit of an issue
inviting people...
What? I was at their wedding!
No one thought they would
ever see you again!
- Oh, okay.
- Including me, so...
Oh, wow, yeah. Just...
That honesty thing you've got?
You can turn that down whenever.
- No, truly.
- Seriously...
I wanna give this a chance,
and I don't want to bring in
the whole band yet.
Is that okay?
Yeah, it's fine. I have to work
this weekend, anyway.
Then why are you bugging me?
That's why I came,
to tell you I won't make it.
- You're being obnoxious. Get out.
- Oh!
- You're bugging me.
- No, you mean "attractive."
- No, no, in English it's "attractive."
- I mean...
- It's okay.
- Fuck you.
Ow! Oh, God!
That's... never mind.
- That gives me a great idea.
- Don't look it up.
Hey, Bob!
- Hey.
- What's up?
Hi, sis, what's up?
You look lovely.
You look strange, sis. Happy.
So you're telling me
the blond guy is working?
Jeez! You don't know how much.
Thanks to me. And don't say "jeez"
in front of Bobby.
It sounds too much like "Jesus".
That car can only be Daniel's.
- Three 8s.
- Oh, no!
Three 6s.
Hi!
Can't we get rid of you?
I miss your Mom.
What do you want me to do?
Oh, such a big hug!
If you want to play, join us now.
Bobs, you're with me, okay?
You're gonna help me get
all of Daniel's money, your uncle Daniel.
I've been waiting many years
for this moment.
So you've finally
learned to play well?
I can play almost anything.
Okay, let's go then.
Come on.
It's the International
Sock Skating Championship!
Bobby wins!
Up next...
Clara... and Daniel!
Clara wins!
- Yeah! You suck!
- You're all cheaters!
There you go.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
Nothing.
I was just coming to say good night.
Oh. Good night.
Okay.
This is Asher Grace.
Message, please.
Hey, Ash! So, I take it back.
Please come.
Uh... I know you work tomorrow,
but you can come the next day,
or whenever you can.
Um, the address is saved
on your Waze, I think?
We used your phone, right?
Those things got saved?
Anyway, it's pretty much
a straight line from the border.
Oh, and don't forget your passport.
If not, you're gonna stay here forever.
Tsk. Okay.
Well, see you soon.
Hopefully.
You can call me
if, uh, you get lost, you know,
or you can just...
You can text me, as well. Okay! Bye.
Morning, sunshine.
Don't judge me.
I didn't hear anybody.
I thought I was alone.
They went to that beach
Francisco likes.
No, what? Why didn't they
wake me up?
I love the view on the way there.
Did you really wipe off my drool?
You want us to go?
No... No! No!
Hey, Claridad! That's enough!
Oh...
- What?
- Hop on.
- No, I'm not crazy.
- Please.
Hop on.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Aah! Ha ha!
That's it! Yes...
People don't come here
as much because it's not as hot,
but I love it here.
It reminds me of...
- Of what?
- Well...
Of family.
You know what I've been
thinking about a lot?
How to get dressed so it doesn't show
how much you care?
Your first apartment in L.A.
I mean, I've never been
as hot as I was there.
Seriously, your sticky bedsheets?
And I've lived in the Amazon!
No, man... And the smell of dry soil.
That place was a death trap.
But you did escape with your life.
Sometimes I don't even know why I left.
Because you couldn't
stand in the shower.
- No, silly...
- Yeah, okay, okay.
You wanted to do more things,
didn't you? See other things.
And don't tell me you regret it,
because I don't buy it.
No, no, I don't regret it.
But I'd have made you
come with me.
"Made me"?
You didn't even ask me.
You wouldn't have come.
What? You would have?
- No.
- No.
- No, I wouldn't have.
- Right.
What's the name of that kid you're seeing?
Don't be an ass.
- I'm just asking.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.
- You're asking like the ass you are.
No, I'm just...
I don't... I don't see you with him.
- You don't?
- No.
He's not your type.
- What do you know?
- But I do, I know you.
People don't change.
He's not your type.
I'm giving him a whirl.
That's just it. He doesn't fit you.
- He's nice and cute.
- Then he's a koala.
You're seeing a koala.
Shut up.
He's easy to... deal with.
He's easy to love.
He's easy to see.
- "He's easy to see"?
- Yeah.
Come on...
- I'm done talking about it.
- Why?
With you, I'm done talking about it
with you.
Okay.
- What about you?
- What?
What? Aren't you old enough to date?
- I'm just saying.
- And I believe I am.
You've not found anyone...
I don't know, interesting enough
to be your first wife?
No.
- Nobody?
- No.
But then you're dating that koala.
Besides, you already
were my first wife.
I don't remember you
being my lawfully anything.
What's a wife?
It's a home, a family...
- You're my first home.
- Exactly.
- Mm-hmm, exactly.
- Yeah.
We always leave our first home.
Come on, chatterbox, let's go.
- Hey!
- Hey!
About time!
How was your morning?
- Huh?
- Just fine.
How fine?
Did you and Daniel talk?
Why's he here, Mom?
Because he's back.
No, he's back in Los Angeles.
Why is he here?
He invited himself.
Why would that be?
Mom... stop playing Cupid.
But why? I really love seeing him.
When I hug him, I feel
like I'm hugging Clara ten years ago.
He represents a time in her life.
Which time? *The "I'm happy
and in love" time?
Or the "I'll cry for months
because he left" time?
I can't forget...
the way Daniel used to make you laugh.
The house would shake.
It was a laughter that made you fly.
That's true...
Fly they did.
Oh!
- My coffee!
- Abby!
The face started melting off.
There's so much talent here!
Ay, ay, ay!
Sorry.
- Hey...
- Mm?
Many things have changed
since you last saw me naked.
I know.
No, I don't mean in life,
I mean like this.
Check it out.
You wanna see my washboard?
- Oh, yeah? Show me...
- Check 'em out.
That's horrible...
Mm...
Shh...
You see? That's what happens.
She's your girlfriend. She's...
- No, that's enough!
- Give me a sec, hold on.
Imagine you're standing up.
You've no idea, Clara, what it felt like.
You can't imagine...
And suddenly you're going that way and...
No, enough, yeah.
I don't want to love you.
Why do I still love you?
You're right.
There's no other way.
What about you?
Me neither.
We'll always love each other.
Even when we're apart.
There's no way around it.
Loving each other or being apart?
Morning.
Hey...
Why are you up so early?
Max snores.
Max? Wake up.
Hey, wake up.
Let's have sex.
Max?
Sex. Come on.
Hmm.
What? No, wait.
Yeah, yeah.
- Too late!
- Yeah! Let's do it.
Oh, man.
Oh, no...
Clara, hi. Um...
Just letting you know I got your message,
and I'll be there tonight, okay?
See you soon.
Hi, Lisa, it's Dr. Barron.
Could you do me a favor?
Could you please call Lily
and Beto Alvarez
and tell them that I can
see them today, after all?
Yes, I'll be there in three hours. Okay.
Has he not hurt you enough?
Do you want him to kill you?
Let's not be so nosy or overdramatic.
What are you wearing?
I've a patient in Los Angeles.
He was gone by the time I woke up.
Yeah, to the kitchen.
Whatever. I need to leave.
I need to breathe.
And I called Asher
and I told him to come,
but he's not picking up
and I need to go intercept him.
You called Asher here
with Daniel in the room?
- Before that.
- What do you mean, before?
Daniel has been here
since before we arrived.
Before... last night.
I called him to neutralize Daniel.
Asher is a great Daniel neutralizer.
Right, and who will neutralize him?
I'll be back tonight.
Alone or with the neutralizer?
I don't know.
I can deal, Abby. I promise.
I just have to hold on until he leaves
again, which I'm sure will be soon.
But I need reinforcements.
I'm going out... for reinforcements.
And I need your car.
Hi. I'm Dr. Barron.
I'm looking for Dr. Grace.
He's a resident down here.
I know who he is.
He's not here.
Um, are you sure?
'Cause he said he would be...
I'm sure. He asked for the shift off,
annoyed the crap out of me.
Okay.
This is Asher Grace.
Message, please.
Mm...
Well... Everything looks fine.
It seems Clark's
been having a good time.
We've been working out together.
- Beto and you?
- No, Clark and me.
Is it okay if they work out?
Of course, yes, as long as it's not high
impact and she's not sore at the end,
she can work out
as much as she wants.
Cool, cool.
See, Beto doesn't like to work out.
Not that it shows...
but his belly's as big as mine,
only he has no excuse.
Between that and the hair, well...
You know what, Lily?
It's none of my business, but...
you're having a child with this man.
You shouldn't talk to him that way.
And Beto, stop rubbing on that shirt.
You won't clean it now. Rather...
I've known you for a long time.
You're very nice people.
You once loved
each other very much
and you had the potential
to be good parents,
but if you keep on being this idiotic,
which, by the way, you're great at,
the only potential you have
is that of ruining your baby's life,
and it's not his fault if his parents
can't stand each other.
So you either make up or break up,
because bringing a baby
into this situation...
Mm-mm.
It's not right, okay?
Okay?
Okay, okay.
Yeah.
Cool beans.
Today's appointment is on me.
Why not?
Watch it, idiot!
- Sorry!
- Asher!
Clara. What are you doing here?
I'm literally on my way
to your parents' house.
I , uh, had a patient,
and I was looking for you.
But you're not answering your phone,
and you're not at work
when you say you will be, so...
Clara, I can explain.
Uh, don't.
Uh, I gotta go. I have to go
to my parents' for dinner.
- Yeah, well, let's go.
- Uh, no. No.
Are you uninviting me
to the family weekend?
Yes.
Uh-uh.
- You don't want to come, trust me.
- I do. I do.
- Asher.
- Clara.
I do.
Pfft.
Whatever it is, I'm up for it.
Hey, I , uh...
I want to explain where I've been
the past couple of days,
and why I wasn't answering my phone.
- No, that's okay.
- No, no, no, I want to.
Um...
So, my wife, Liz, she...
Your wife?
Well, see...
Your wife? Oh, my God.
Oh, no, no, no. It's not like that.
- No, she's not around or anything.
- Oh, my God, I'm such an idiot.
- No, she's not...
- What do you mean, she's not around?
She's dead, Clara. She died.
My God, Asher, I'm so sorry.
It's... you...
It was, uh, two years ago yesterday.
And I forgot.
You forgot?
The, uh, the date.
Caught me by surprise.
I just... I've been...
Look, I wanted to apologize
because I was supposed to be at work,
and I know I wasn't, and I'm sorry.
Yeah, damn, yeah, yeah.
No. Okay.
You're a 28-year-old widower?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was, uh, 19 when we got married.
Why?
I was in love.
Yeah, well...
I was in love when I was 19,
and I didn't get married.
Well, I did.
Oh, my God, I'm such a horrible person.
What? Why?
Daniel is at my parents' house
right now.
Yeah, of course he is.
What do you mean,
"Of course he is"?
Well, you obviously needed
some form of extreme backup
when you changed your mind
about inviting me.
Come on!
Are we both completely
screwed up, Ash?
Both of...? No, you are.
That's for certain.
Me, I'm a respectable widower,
thank you very much.
Right, you do have that
going for you.
Yeah.
Bring on the ex, hmm?
Are you allowed to scold your patients
like they were your spoiled students?
No... But I'd had it.
Right, but you are their doctor.
They have to trust you.
Asher agrees with me.
I know, I do.
Okay... they do trust her, though.
That's why it was great you told them.
I'm sorry, it's just...
Okay...
People often don't know
what they want, right?
And they go through life
forming couples,
just to see if they can save themselves.
I'm sorry, it doesn't work like that.
It was great someone they trust
told them what life is like.
Yeah, I overreached, but they deserved it.
You should see them.
You guys should see them.
They hate each other.
And I've known them for a while
and they used to be happy.
Then they chose the moment when their
marriage went to shit to have a baby.
It's just...
It's mean.
Exactly!
It's mean to have a go
at someone you don't know
about things you don't understand.
Well, yeah, but no.
Ahem. I mean, it takes two seconds to see
if a couple is happy, you know,
if they belong together,
or if they just settled, right?
Have a taste?
I mean, look in this room.
No? Look at Francisco and Eva.
It's obvious they belong together.
Obvious who's happy and who's not.
Here you go.
Yeah, the mole's, um, it's great. Ahem.
Where did you, uh...
How'd you learn how to make it?
Oh, this old lady
in Oaxaca taught me.
We were setting up sort of like a pirate
health station in the Sierra.
Thanks.
He's not neutralizing him , is he?
Maybe you can have
for a threesome later.
The trick is just to let
the last chili float.
It will be great with the chocolate,
so then you get the hotness
without the acidity.
You get the punch.
Actually, if you grind it all up before,
and then let it meld together,
it makes it smoother.
But it's probably a bit
too late for that now, I guess.
Oh, is that right?
Oh, sorry, one of my patients
is the son of a Mexican chef.
Oh, 'cause I thought your Mexican
grandmother Jacinta
taught you how to make mole.
She's not real, Daniel.
Clara made her up.
We can't all be as authentically Mexican
as you, champ.
Or as randomly bicultural
as you, right, "champ"?
All right, all right,
please, that's enough.
Daniel, thank you for dinner,
but I think it's too late for mole,
isn't it?
Let's all go to bed, please.
Clara.
Good night.
Good night. Good night.
I'm sorry he's being a dick.
Don't. Don't, please.
What? I'm sorry.
Uh, I gotta say, Clara...
This time I feel like
he has a valid reason for it.
Ash, I...
Don't... I'm not asking for details.
I just, um...
I've gotta say it.
Good morning, Asher.
Morning.
Do you want to play?
Uh, sure. Yeah.
- Deal him in, Francisco.
- Thank you.
Hey, listen, bro, I'm really sorry
about last night.
It got kind of weird. I'm sorry.
It's fine.
What's going on?
You can still get in. Come on.
All arguments in this house
are solved with a card game,
especially a poker game.
I should probably let you all know
I'm not very good.
Join the club.
It's people lying.
You know, that's what poker's all about.
So that's why some of the members
of this family excel at it, hmm?
Are you good at telling
when someone's lying to you, Ash?
Keeping stuff from you?
Good enough to know you're not talking
about poker anymore, sure.
Hey, smart man.
You still know how to pick 'em, Clara.
Daniel, come with me a sec, please?
I'll go with you anywhere you want
for as long as you want.
Excuse me.
Okay, I want two.
Are you having fun?
- And you?
- You having a blast?
Yeah, I am.
Did you have a blast last night?
How old are you?
- Asher?
- You're like an adolescent!
You're behaving like a child. Stop it!
- Stop what?
- I mean, no, no.
I can't do this with you!
Because I wasn't thinking straight.
You get inside my head
and I can't think straight.
We're doing this?
We're gonna do this?
We're doing this. Here we go.
I don't want to wake up alone
feeling like an idiot ever again
if you can't even stay
and sleep next to me.
This can't be.
You've been leaving all your life.
- So go away!
- I'm here!
I've not left. I'm here, okay?
And if I leave, I'm leaving with you.
- I don't believe you.
- You don't believe me?
Why can't you believe, Clara,
that people can fall in love
and stay together
if you see it every damn day?
No, but I do believe it.
Other people. Fortunate people.
I somehow pissed off fate and got you.
Yeah, I've seen it triumph once.
The rest of the time, it's failed.
I lost count of the women
who come to my office,
crying because they can
no longer stand the husband
I saw them long for two years earlier.
And there's the men who come in
with their menopausal wives,
whom they dump for teenagers.
And we're all the same, right?
I'm like them.
No, you're worse.
You didn't even get to start.
You didn't even show up.
- Look, I love you.
- You love me?
Right, you love me just like you did
the first time around,
and we know it wasn't very much.
Oh, Clara.
What are you doing with that kid?
- I like him.
- Yeah, okay.
You like him like you like warm water.
Please don't tell me
you're with him because it's easy,
because I swear, if you do...
I'll say whatever
I feel like saying, okay?
As many times as I want to say it,
because this is all your fault.
This is all your fault!
You come here,
feeling all superior,
thinking you're who knows what,
calling me a liar.
I was standing there 10 years ago, talking
about love to the point of exhaustion,
and you still left!
You took all that with you!
And I won't let you do
the same thing to me.
That's what I'm doing with that kid, okay?
I'm compensating.
Because life will go on
when he leaves too.
And when you leave again...
It was wonderful meeting everybody.
Thank you so much for dinner last night.
It was beautiful. Thank you.
Asher...
Oh, oh, she's coming back.
She's coming back.
Yep.
Asher!
Ash, wait!
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's fine. It's fine.
Hey, can you bring my stuff
to the hospital, please?
I don't really feel like
going back inside.
No, no, no. Don't leave like this.
- What?
- I'm sorry.
How? How do you want me to leave?
- I'm sorry.
- What am I doing here?
What are you sorry for? What?
I slept with him.
I'm sorry that I slept with him.
You think that's why I'm leaving?
I know you slept with him.
I knew that the moment
I saw you two together.
Come on, I'm not that stupid, Clara.
What? Then... what?
You still think you're using me.
No, Asher, I'm not...
I... I know you're not, but you don't.
And as you stand here
and say it to me,
you still think you're lying to me.
You think you're using me,
but actually you want me...
in the same way that you think
you sleep around to keep your distance,
but in fact you're looking for closeness.
In the exact same way,
Clara, that you insult your patients.
You think you do that
because you can't stand them?
It's in fact because you adore them.
You don't know yourself at all.
No clue why you do anything.
It'd be adorable if it wasn't so pathetic.
And you left my car in Los Angeles.
How have you been feeling?
Fine.
Lily, I wanted to apologize for what
happened at the last appointment.
It was unprofessional
and I'm really sorry.
I wanted to wait for Beto...
Beto is not coming.
- Is he working?
- No.
You were right.
Mm.
- Lily...
- And speaking about that...
since this is
our last scheduled checkup,
I wanted to let you know
I'm changing my delivery plan.
I respect you a lot, but I won't be
needing your services anymore.
I've been talking to Dr. Malmet,
and I think his energy suits mine better.
Of course. It's your plan.
You have to do
whatever helps you best,
- and Dr. Malmet is excellent.
- Can we begin?
Of course.
Clara, it's me and Bobby.
- Hello.
- Hi.
TÃ­a Clara, you look terrible.
Sweetie, can you do me a huge favor?
Can you please go
into your auntie's closet
and find me an outfit I can borrow?
Yep.
Thank you.
Don't start, Abby.
I'm wallowing in my grief.
It's like I killed someone.
You're being ridiculous.
Get up and do something.
This is just self-indulgent movie crap.
Okay, so things went sideways
with a couple of guys.
You're an adult. Get up
and dust yourself off.
That's it.
What?
No, it's cute that you say that to me.
You've no idea
what you're talking about.
- Mm-hmm.
- I envy you, sis.
You don't know how it feels when you can't
breathe because someone's not there.
That's the truth. You didn't get it 10
years ago, when you married Max,
and you don't get it now, as you stay
with him due to a lack of imagination.
Mom?
I'm sorry, Bobs, I was playing.
- I didn't mean... I didn't mean that.
- Let's go.
- Abby, please...
- No, leave me alone.
Just leave me alone!
You don't even know
which guy takes your breath away.
This is Asher Grace.
Message, please.
Oh, hey, it's you!
Hey... Ooh!
You brought a chica!
Oh, my God, congratulations.
He is so sweet!
Too bad he's lost in bed.
I... I blame his college
girlfriends for that.
Ooh.
Hey, Dani, what's up?
I'm singing about you.
"The First Cut ls the Deepest."
It means "the first wound
is the most..."
'Sup? Oh, you're bringing me...
I'll have one more.
No, no, no. It's time to go, Claridad.
Well...
There we are.
- Ooh.
- Here you go.
Keys.
Hmm.
It's so unfair.
What is?
I used to dream about this.
What, about this?
Yeah, I'd be with a guy in a bar,
and you showed up and carried me out.
What's unfair about it?
My dream wasn't sad.
Come on.
What?
What is it?
Can you breathe
when you're not with me?
What? I...
Yes.
Do you think we've ever been in love?
Oh, my... All right.
Okay, your sister is an imbecile.
No, it's not about her.
I know. It...
It's about this.
This wasn't here two months ago.
Because I'm getting old!
This is an old lady hand freckle!
You're not helping.
I'm saying that it's new.
I know every inch of you,
but you remain surprising.
I notice every tiny change
because I'm here to notice.
My purpose in life...
is to keep track of you,
Abigail Barron.
And I don't...
care what your family theory is,
and I am sure that it is complex,
but that's love.
I can breathe without you just fine.
What would be the point?
Thank you for running my bath
like an English butler.
Don't mention it.
I had a good look
when you went in, so... we both won.
Can I ask you a serious question?
Mm-hmm.
Are you leaving again?
I don't know.
Why'd you come back?
Don't say it was because of us,
because you spent months here
without a word.
I'm no longer
with Doctors Without Borders.
Why?
Because...
they very kindly asked me to leave,
as it seemed...
I was not committed.
They know you.
Yeah.
So you came back because you have
nowhere far to be.
That's horrible.
I mean, all my life I've wanted to be
elsewhere.
Your neck is the only thing
that called me back...
And my Mom's cooking.
That too.
But the truth is...
that most of the time
I just want to go to hell.
The food's terrible there.
I don't want to go there with you.
Well, then I'll go on my own.
Just don't say I didn't ask you
to come, okay?
Are you in love with him?
Mom, I've always been in love with him.
Well, he's family.
You love him like he's family.
But that doesn't mean
you're in love with him.
Ever since he left...
I've measured all guys against him.
Well, not against him,
but against what he... made me feel.
And they were no match,
and I loved getting rid of them.
It made me feel superior.
It made me feel
like I'd avoided a mistake,
so I wouldn't settle and become...
Your sister.
Yeah.
That's a horrible way of thinking, right?
Meanwhile, you and Dad...
you make a big show of your wedding,
like we needed to feel
even less than we do.
Oh, nonsense!
It's the truth, Mom.
You two set an impossible example.
Don't be dumb, honey.
You know how many times
I've fallen out of love with your Dad?
I've lost count.
Besides, do you think when we got
together we knew we'd be this lucky?
When I met your Dad,
he was a barefoot wetback painting
graffiti around Echo Park.
I moved in with him because...
he was the most handsome man
I'd ever seen. That's the truth.
But do you think I ever thought
I'd marry him 40 years later,
more in love with him than ever?
Things didn't look
very promising back then.
You see? Then nobody knows anything
and the whole thing is a scam.
No, it's not a scam , baby.
Everybody ends up loving somebody.
But it's pure chance.
You meet somebody,
and you bet on them,
with no guarantees.
And if you ask me,
you already have the advantage of knowing
on whom you want to bet.
- Mom...
- Love doesn't have to be simple, baby.
But it does have to be easy.
Mom, you're a witch.
Hello?
Hi, Dr. Barron?
Dr... Barron? Asher.
I'm calling about Lily Alvarez.
What's going on?
Look, Clara, she's, uh...
She's gone into labor,
and she's all by herself.
Now, I know you're not
her doctor anymore,
but she's terrified,
and since you broke up her marriage,
- I thought maybe...
- I'll be right there.
If everybody loves somebody,
I love you.
Mm!
Who'd have told me
you'd be my cheesy daughter?
Hi, Beto.
Beto, Beto, Beto.
No, get dressed.
You can't come looking like that.
Your wife is about to give birth.
Yeah, I know, but she
doesn't want me there.
Oh, my God, Beto! Okay.
I don't wanna tell you what to do,
because last time you listened to me
it was a huge mess,
but here it goes...
Your issue with Lily
is you listen to her too much.
She's your wife, she's in labor,
and you'll be there...
whether she likes it or not.
Okay?
She'll like it. You'll see.
Yeah, yeah...
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Beto! Beto! Beto...
See? Told you.
Oh, Beto...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No, I am sorry.
I should've been here earlier.
Way earlier...
Hi. I'm Dr. Barron.
I'm here to check up
on Clark Alvarez's cleaning.
Sure. I was about
to bring him to his parents.
Oh, that's okay. I'll do it.
- Okay. You're welcome.
- Thanks.
He's named after Superman.
Hey.
- Hi.
- Hey.
It's good that you came.
Can't believe you brought Beto.
Yeah, turns out I miss the Alvarezes.
Who would've thought?
Me.
Never know what you have, right?
I should go.
Ahem.
Okay, uh, good to see you, Dr. Grace.
Goodbye, Dr. Barron.
Look, Clark, those are your parents.
We'll have a long chat
about them later, okay?
I know.
Here he is.
Hi, Clark...
What's up, son?
What's up, baby?
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay...
Are you calmer now?
What happened, my boy?
You'll make him cry. Give him to me.
No, he's fine. He's fine with his Dad.
- You're holding him wrong.
- No, baby, like this.
- Just taste it.
- Okay, okay, okay.
Is it good?
Uh-huh. Ahem. Yeah.
What you doing that for?
Bobby, don't answer that alone!
It's Aunt Clara. I told her to wait.
I was...
Don't apologize.
- You were wrong.
- I know.
No, I'm not saying you were wrong
in what you said.
I mean you're wrong,
fundamentally wrong about my marriage.
I know.
I really do.
Okay.
What are you doing over there?
- Well...
- There's pasta.
Fine. We forgive you.
- So, pasta, huh?
- Yeah. I made the sauce.
You literally just got here. Don't.
Mm!
- You look so good.
- Hmm!
You look happy.
See, I had like a thousand epiphanies.
Yuck! That's why I avoid them
at all costs.
My patients had their baby
yesterday and I saw them...
Well, it was the patients
with the serious issues...
The mole patients?
Yeah, those patients.
They were holding their baby
and all I could think of was...
"I want that."
You want to argue?
I can help you there.
I see it all the time: new babies,
happy couples, families.
But I want that now.
- I know...
- No, you and I are family.
We're no longer a couple.
We grew past that.
I know, I know...
I'm sorry about the way I left, okay?
I'm sorry I let you go.
The number-one thing I always tell
girls your age
is always, always use a condom.
The fact that you
have already had a kid
and in a month you already look
like that is amazing!
Face just hit the surfboard,
and I started, just, like...
Love. I see it every day.
Come on!
And everybody has it.
It doesn't matter if it doesn't
look like what you imagined.
Guys, I love you.
Or if itâ€™s not fed every day...
- Don't be a stranger.
- No, no, no. I'll be back soon.
Thank you.
Or if it changes and is reborn.
Mmm!
Love you, guys!
Nobody knows anything.
I do believe that love is ridiculous,
complicated and unlikely.
But we have to let it be.
But we have to let it be.
It surprises you when you least expect it.
First date, Grace.
Tablecloths.
Hmm.
Asher...
I... I don't need a big speech,
and you clearly don't know
very much, anyway.
That was the gist of my speech!
You know, you don't know
everything, either.
Yeah, I know that, too.
Mm!
Oh!
I still got you there!
Have to catch me!
Ahem.
Australian Asher Grace is back.
- Pay up. Money. Give it to me.
- Pay him.
This was a bet?
When did this become a bet?
- That's...
- That's the way we are.
You bet against me!
Just for the record, I'd like you to see
who's collecting the money.
Yeah, well, thank you, Max, but...
Don't come to me with your dollar.
