- Go, go, go!
- Go, go!
Yes! Yes!
Oh, my God!
Don't cry.
Don't let 'em
see you cry, Haley.
You will get them next time.
All right?
'Cause what are you?
Huh? What are you?
The apex predator.
Yeah, you are.
Apex predator. All day.
- Hey, what's up?
- Is everything okay?
I've been calling you all morning.
Sorry. Late night, early practice.
You're having practice during a hurricane?
More than one million people
now facing mandatory evacuation orders.
They said it was gonna miss us.
Don't you get alerts on your phone?
It's gonna hit really hard.
- Louie, honey.
- Hey, bubba. Look at you.
Hi. Hi.
Anyway, Haley, listen.
Have you heard from Dad?
No. Why?
Oh, he's not answering my calls.
Well, he probably had a late night too.
Yeah, I just need to know he's okay.
They've already evacuated
the whole south coast.
Well, maybe he left already.
Or maybe he's doing
something stupid,
like trying to ride it out.
You know what he's like.
Well, what does Mom say?
Mom's in Paris.
Ah, with Prince Charming?
Give her a break.
Dad should've returned my calls by now.
He always does.
Look, I'll drive down
and check on him.
- Are you crazy?
- 75 South will be empty.
I can be there in, like, two hours.
I'm not having both of you
down there in a Category 5.
Then why did you call me?
Because I thought you might
have heard from him.
Well, I haven't.
Not for a while.
- Did you fight again?
- He fights with me.
Because you're exactly alike.
Yeah, and you're more like Mom.
Empathetic from a safe distance.
Okay, forget it.
- Beth, I gotta go.
- Stay safe.
If you hear from him, text me.
- Okay. I love you.
- Love you too.
- Bye.
- Bye, little cutie.
...maybe 150 miles per hour.
That is ridiculous. That can't be true.
I'm telling you,
if you think that's funny, get this.
- Go ahead.
- Pasco County
sheriff's office have warned people
to not shoot guns into the hurricane.
What?
You can't shoot guns in a hurricane?
Well, it's dangerous!
Florida is a stand-your-ground
state after all.
Hell yeah, it is! That's why I'm here.
You've reached Dave Keller,
Dave Keller Construction.
Probably up a ladder somewhere,
so please leave a message.
Dad, it's Haley. Call me back.
Beth's worried about you.
Okay.
Oh, man. What a shit show.
I swear to God,
if you've already left...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
Slow down, slow down.
Sorry, miss, we can't let you...
Haley! What's up?
Hey, Wayne.
How's it going?
We've had better days.
The evacuation drives people nuts.
This guy tried to go around.
No hurricane party this year?
I don't think so.
Hey, how's your sister? Your old man says
she's living up in Boston.
Yeah. Yeah, she's good.
She actually asked me
to go check on him.
Uh, I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
The storm's turning west
and heading straight for us.
- We're not letting anyone through.
- Come on, Wayne.
He's not answering his phone.
Look, I know the roads.
I'll be in and out, I promise.
I'm really sorry, Haley.
I wish I could help you out, but I just...
I can't.
I wouldn't want you to get hurt.
Okay, I understand.
Maybe you could check on him later
if you get a chance?
- Sure, I'll try.
- Thanks.
Drive safe.
Uh, say hi to your sister for me.
- Sure.
- Okay.
Turn around.
Fuck it.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop!
All roads are closed up ahead.
Uh, come in.
Stop!
Just wait! Stay where you are.
It looks like Wendy's now gonna go
right through the middle of our state.
We strongly urge local residents
to listen to all warnings from officials.
If you're in an evacuation zone,
you gotta get out.
You can't wait.
We... We won't be able
to come for you.
I hope every parent in the state
is thinking,
"How do I keep my family safe?"
Dad?
Dad?
Dad!
Hi. Hey, Sugar.
Hey, girl.
Where's Daddy?
I missed you.
Where's Dad, hey?
Where is he?
No sign of Dad, but Sugar's here.
He wouldn't have gone without her.
It's weird. It's like a ghost town.
Everyone's gone.
Please,
just get yourself somewhere safe,
even if you have to stop at a shelter.
You think he went to the old house?
No, I think it's been in escrow
since the divorce.
Beth, there's pictures of you, me, and Mom
laid out everywhere.
This condo is horrible.
It's depressing.
Haley, you have to stop blaming them.
It was their mutual decision.
Whatever. I'm gonna check the house.
- No, don't you dare. I'm not hav...
- Hey, I bumped into
your ex-boyfriend Wayne
on the way down.
He was not my boyfriend.
Whatever you say. I still remember
the time Dad caught you guys.
Stop! Oh, my God.
How do you remember that? You were like...
I was eight.
- God.
- Scarred me for life.
I'm never gonna live that down.
No. Never ever.
Don't give me that look.
I was gonna visit more. I just...
got busy.
I'm trying to have
a life of my own, you know.
I love visiting the swamp.
Heat, humidity,
mosquitoes.
What's not to like, eh?
Oh, yeah, except you.
My little fur baby.
Oh, thank God.
Come on, Sugar.
Dad!
Hello?
Dad, you here?
Dad?
Marco! Polo! Anybody?
Dad!
Dad!
Where is he, girl?
Come on.
Shit.
Oh, my God.
Sugar? What is it, girl?
Shit.
Is he there?
Can you hear him? Dad?
Dad? Dad!
I gotta go down there, don't I?
Okay.
Ah.
Okay.
It's cool.
Cable guys do it all the time.
Dad?
Stay here, okay?
Uh!
Ohh!
Oh, God!
Dad?
Aww!
Ugh, shit.
Dad!
I swear to God, Dad.
Only you would come down here
in a frickin' hurricane.
Hard and loud.
Florida's best hard and heavy music.
Hard Rock Radio 98.5.
Florida's best hard rock radio.
Dad!
Dad!
Dad. No.
Shit.
Shit.
Oh, shit. Daddy.
Dad.
Okay, you're breathing. All right.
What's happened? Dad?
Oh, my God.
Okay. We need to get to a hospital,
all right? We need to go right now.
Okay.
Fuck.
Okay.
Windows for hurricane-force winds
Sunday morning
until Sunday evening.
We're almost there, Dad.
Ahh! Shit!
Oh, my...
No, no.
Dad.
Beth?
Beth?
It's Haley, Dad.
Hang on, hang on.
Be careful.
There's a big gator.
Yeah, I know.
We've already met.
How'd it even get down here?
I don't know.
It must've come through the...
through the overflow drainpipe
on the lake side.
Ohh.
Why did you come here?
You're welcome.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
You need to go. Now.
- Not without you.
- I don't need your help.
Ah, ah...
Yeah, I can clearly see that.
Wait.
Sugar?
Yeah. She helped me find you.
You look good.
You look like shit.
What's with the beard?
Oh, it's for my Internet dating.
What's happening with the storm?
It's pretty bad.
Everyone's gone.
What are you even doing here?
I wanted to board up some vents.
I mean, in this house.
I thought you sold the place.
Deal fell through.
Oh, my God!
Oh, shit. What happened?
Got tangled up in the pipes
when he tried to drag me.
That's how I escaped.
We're okay
on this side of the pipes.
It's too big to get back here.
I've gotta go get my phone.
Nobody is coming
in this storm, Haley.
I have to try.
I'm getting us out of here.
Okay, okay.
Go this way. It's safer. Okay.
You keep your eye on him.
They can't hear you out of the water.
They can see you in the dark.
- They're not as fast out of...
- I know, Dad.
Stay here.
Well, I thought I'd go for a run.
Dad? Keep talking to me.
How's your split
in the hundred free?
- Really?
- You asked me to talk.
We already talked
about the weather.
I lost my last relay.
- When?
- This morning at practice.
By two hundredths.
Two hundredths, that's nothing.
You got that.
You just gotta want it, baby.
If I lose my spot on the travel team,
I lose my scholarship.
- Maybe I've reached my limit.
- No.
I keep telling you, it's not your body
that's holding you back.
Because what are you?
You're not my coach anymore, Dad.
That apex-predator shit doesn't help.
I'm just saying, you could
believe in yourself a little more.
Oh, yeah. Look who's talking.
Every athlete reaches a plateau.
- Dad, just stop.
- It's normal.
I need to focus, okay?
Haley, just forget about the team.
Just remember what got you
into swimming in the first place.
You did.
You're gonna blame me
'cause you have a gift.
And I needed
to kick you in the butt a little.
I know you, Haley.
You're not gonna give up now.
You don't know anything about me.
Yes.
Ahh, Haley!
No!
Haley!
Ah, ahh!
Haley! No!
Haley!
Ahh!
Ah!
Ah, ahh!
Ahh!
Haley!
Are you all right?
Ah!
Haley!
Haley, answer me!
Haley!
Dad!
There's two of 'em!
Are you hurt?
Are you hurt?
I'm fine.
You don't sound like you're fine.
I'm safe.
Uhh.
The National Weather
Service has issued a flash flood warning
for all of southern and western Florida.
Catastrophic levee failure may occur.
Residents should avoid low-lying areas.
No shit.
- Dad?
- Yeah?
Can you see them?
Hang on.
Where are they?
I'm gonna go to the front of the house
to see if I can call for help.
I hear something moving
over near the stairs.
I think they're still over there.
The wind threat has increased
from the previous assessment.
Emergency planning
includes a reasonable...
...for major hurricane...
Ah.
Dad! Dad, I see some people!
Help! Help!
- You check the register?
- Empty.
- It's heavy.
- You got it? Wait, wait, wait.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
Whoo!
How we gonna open this baby?
Who cares? Think of all the shit
we'll get with all this cash.
Maybe it's empty too.
Feels pretty loaded to me.
Come on, Stan, time to go!
Will you go get your brother?
We have to leave.
Come on, Stan!
What the fuck are you doing? Marv!
I think there's some people
in that house over there.
Help!
Help! Help!
Marv! Marv, there's nothing there.
Let's go. You're gonna get shot.
Hey! Hey, we're here!
Come on!
Please!
See, I told you... Fuck!
Shit.
No!
No!
Stan!
Stan, get out of the water!
Get out of the water, Stan!
Stan!
Ah!
Haley? Listen to me.
There's another way out.
Go over to the other access hatch.
By the entrance to the house.
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah!
Crawl along the foundation
till you reach the wet wall.
They're all wet, Dad.
No, listen.
It's where all the pipes go up
into the house.
But be careful.
You'll be pretty exposed over there.
Okay.
Ahh, ahh.
Oh.
Hey, Sugar. Hey.
Good girl.
Hey, girl.
Good girl.
Did you find it?
Yeah, it's stuck.
There's something on top of it.
Is there a plan B?
That was our plan B.
In less than an hour,
this crawl space will be under water.
What about the overflow drainpipe?
No. They came in from there.
Come back to this side of the pipes.
We'll figure something out.
There's somebody out there.
Dad, it's the police!
Help! Hello!
- Hey!
- It's Wayne. Help!
Stay with the boat. I'll be right back.
Haley?
- Hey, Wayne!
- Wayne!
Wayne!
Down here!
Wayne!
Hey!
Mr. Keller!
Mr. Keller!
Wayne! Wayne!
- Wayne!
- Wayne!
Wayne!
Wayne!
He's heading to the garage!
Haley!
Wayne?
No, Wayne, wait! Stop!
Stop! Wait, don't come down!
- No! Stay there!
- Hey!
Wait! There's two gators down here!
Okay, hold on.
Don't move. Hold on!
Come in, Pete.
Pete, you copy?
Pete, do you copy?
Pete, goddamn it, man.
Where are you?
I need you down here now
with a snare pole!
Pete, did you hear that?
Help me!
Haley, help me!
Wayne!
Grab my hand!
I got you.
I couldn't save him.
It's okay. Shh.
It's okay. They can't get in here.
We're safe here.
Dad.
Okay.
Shh. It's okay.
It's okay.
I never thought it would end like this.
We should never have come back here.
Haley, you stay strong.
We're getting out of here.
You remember when you were little,
and Beth could hold her breath for
the length of the pool and you couldn't?
I'm not really up for memory lane
right now, Dad.
Yeah, well, you got so mad
and you stormed off.
Yeah, I was a little jerk.
Yeah, well, Haley, that night,
I woke up about 2:00 in the morning
'cause I heard something outside.
I thought it was a burglar,
so I snuck down,
and I saw you in the pool,
taking your giant breaths again and again.
And you did it, Haley.
You figured that shit out all by yourself.
And that's when I knew,
this kid's a fighter.
So we may be stubborn,
but we do not give up.
You gave up on Mom.
Mom was not happy,
and I was selfish,
and I didn't pay enough attention to her.
- Because of me.
- No.
Yes, because you were always with me.
Every weekend at the meets.
On the road away from home.
It had nothing to do with you.
Is that what you think?
It was you and Beth
that kept us together.
When you girls left, we were just...
two lonely people
in a big, empty house.
Nobody to even pretend for.
Your mom got a second chance, Haley,
and she deserves to be happy.
So do you.
I don't think I deserve one.
I miss you.
I miss seeing your face
in the stands when I win.
Why don't you come anymore?
- I thought you were mad at me.
- I am!
I know.
We are gonna beat
these pea-brained lizard shits.
You and me.
They didn't like it
when I was banging on the pipes.
I think I can distract them
if you can dive
all the way under
until you get to the stairs.
Yeah, I can do it.
You ready?
Yeah.
I'm coming back for you, okay?
You'd better.
Okay.
Okay.
Go.
Ahh!
Dad?
I can't make it to the stairs.
I'm going for the drainpipe, okay?
No.
It's too dangerous.
You hear me?
Haley?
Oh.
Oh, shit.
Ah!
Haley!
Haley! Answer me!
I killed one.
Haley? Hey.
Ah!
Hey!
We're over here! Help!
Haley?
Dad!
Haley! Help!
Haley!
Dad, I'm coming!
No!
No.
One, two, three, four.
Come on! Wake up!
No.
Come on. Four, five, six.
Don't quit on me, Daddy, come on!
One, two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Come on, Daddy, wake up!
Come on!
Yes, Daddy, yes! Yes!
Yes, yes, yes!
- You're okay. You're okay.
- Oh, God.
Hey, Sugar.
Okay, Sugar. It's okay.
Come on. Let's get to the car.
Oh, shit.
No way!
Dad, what do we do?
Boat! You see over there?
No, there are too many of 'em.
We need to stay here.
No, those levees are gonna break,
and when they do we can't be here.
That boat's our only chance to leave.
I think we can make it.
It's impossible.
They gather in the floodwaters
'cause it's easier to hunt.
They hunt what splashes.
So no splashing, no hunting.
I think the rain should cover us.
Okay.
Come on, girl.
It's okay. All right.
The eye is above us.
We'd better hurry.
Ohh.
Don't move.
Levees just broke!
Haley, you need to swim.
You got this!
You're faster than they are!
What are you?
Swim!
Whoo!
Apex predator all day!
Come on!
- Hold on!
- Get down!
- Dad! Dad!
- Take my hand!
Help!
- Haley!
- No! No!
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
Dad! Where are you?
Haley!
I'm here!
Oh.
Hey!
Meet me at the stairs.
Oh! Ohh!
Hello? Hello.
Can anybody hear me?
Yes! Yes, hello!
I'm trapped with my father
in our house in Coral Lake.
It's flooded.
There's alligators everywhere.
Please send help.
Please, can you hear me?
No, come on!
Sugar?
Come on. Come here, girl.
Come on.
Good girl.
Good girl.
Haley!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
- Dad!
- Go!
Go!
Swim!
Come on, you son of a bitch!
Come on, we gotta
get to the roof. Come on.
Come on, we gotta go.
Keep the pressure on your arm.
Stay with me!
- The house made it after all.
- Yeah, she's a strong one.
Come on.
I lied to you about the deal.
I just couldn't sign the papers.
- I don't want to sell.
- It doesn't matter, Dad.
- It's just a house.
- It's not just a house. It's our home.
The last place we were a family.
This house isn't our home.
Me and you, that's home.
- Come on. You okay?
- Yeah.
- Did you see that?
- What?
It's the rescue helicopter.
All right, go. Hurry!
Here! We're here!
Help!
Do they see it?
Come on!
Haley!
You okay?
Dad, get to the roof!
- Okay.
- I see a way out!
Ah!
Ah!
Ahh!
