Mommy has a small hole
and daddy has a small stick.
The stick erects, it gets harder, gets into the hole
and mommy and daddy feel very happy.
This is how mommies and daddies
connect with each other.
Look at what kids learn these days!
Translation / Subtitling by
~ Miss Vida Boheme (a.k.a. Chucky) ~
He's a monster, that's what he is. I feel pity
for any woman who will marry him.
- He is fine.
- Fine with that huge belly?
- What belly?
- He sucks his stomach for the photo.
- Anyway he is someone, he has something.
- He has money, that's what he has.
- Costas!
- I'll come out in a second!
If Fedon wasn't rich noone would be
interested at him. And he thinks he's so handsome!
- Hey Costas!
- I said I'm coming!
- What is your husband doing in the bathroom?
- He reads the newspapers for hours.
And where are your
fingers now baby?
In my pussy.
And is your pussy wet?
Yes it's wet and hot.
I wanna lick you baby!
His mind is always on women.
He doesn't care for the company.
I saw him on TV and he seemed OK.
An educated gentleman.
He's just a show-off.
Deep inside he's a pig.
Under his Armani suits he's just
a hairy beast. Like all men.
- Not all men!
- Don't judge by your husband. Costas is different.
I'm cumming babe, I'm cumming!
Costas has a different quality
and he's the exception.
99% of men are like Fedon:
Monsters!
No! I'm ticklish!
- Mister Fedon you called me here to do work.
- We can't talk about work all the time.
- What should we talk about?
- Will you go out with me tonight?
I allready told you. I can't. I have a
boyfriend and we hang out every night.
Every night with the same guy?
Can't you make an exception for me?
It's difficult, but I'll try.
- Mister Fedon...
- What is it Katy?
The models have arrived
for the feta cheese ad.
- Won't you come to choose?
- I'll come in a while.
Okay, sorry for interrupting.
Fuck you bitch!
Fuck you jerk!
- Where were you Fedon?
- I was busy Anna.
These are the top 5 for the ad.
Let me see tits.
Let me see ass.
- Her.
- Are you crazy? It's big.
- Yes but it has great nipples.
- The nipples won't be visible in the ad.
- The T-shirt will be wet so they will be.
- Can't you see it's over-stretched?
I think Stacy's tit is ideal.
Small and modest.
But this one is more mother-like.
The small one is adressed to teens.
We have to promote the cheese to teenagers.
I am a man so -as for tits-
I shall say the last word.
- John!
- What is it?
The door is stuck again, fuck!
- Alexis...the screwdriver.
- The bathroom door again?
Panos get me the screwdriver!
They can't fix the door, but can't
they at least buy a screwdriver?
Go to hell!
You can't even fix a door. You sit
here all day scratching your balls.
-  I do what?
- You create art.
But you can stop for a minute
and call a technician.
- I forgot!
- But you didn't forget to put this shit on your head.
- Is my hair medicine bothering you?
- Everything is bothering me!
Stop yelling at me 'cause
I can yell to, understand?
That's right. If you want the door
fixed, you call the technician.
I can take a shit with the door open.
- I work like a slave.
- Did I force you to work at the company?
Fedon asked me also but I didn't accept.
- You really want to discuss this?
- And say what? That you pay the rent?
- It's not only the rent that I'm paying for.
- If you say one more word about money and shit, I'm gone!
I wish! But be sure to take your creations
with you. I'm drowned by the newspapers!
Don't you dare talking about my creations!
- How many paintings did you sell last year?
- Van Gogh had sold only one also.
If only you could sell one,
one and a half, anything!
- I don't care about sales!
- So why do you make them? To fill the room?
- It's better than selling ads!
- But the ads bring food on the table!
Fuck you!
- John...
- Leave me alone!
- Don't leave me Anna, don't leave me.
- Shhh now.
- She killed him or they're fucking.
- They're probably fucking.
- I have to go now.
- What time will you be back?
I have to work overtime today
OK guys I'm ready.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 action!
- Are you crazy Stephen? You're going to reject this opportunity?
- No Veronica, I just want to fight with my own powers.
- But if I talk to the company managers...
- I don't want you to say anything.
That's why I admire you Stephen.
Because you have a strong personality.
- But I'm afraid my love. My father may reject you--
- I know. He doesn't want his son-in-law to be poor.
Yes. Prejustices still exist.
But I'm not afraid Veronica. I've been decent 
for all my life and I shall continue this way.
- But if talk to the company's vice president...
- No Veronica. Don't say anything.
Don't insist. If I get hired at your father's
company I want it to happen because I earned it.
- Talk to him Vivi.
- And tell him what?
- To hire me at his company.
- Talk to mister Fedon? Me? Are you crazy?
- First of all, I don't even know him.
- You do know him.
I don't feel at ease. I work only for a month there.
We only greet each other. He's old and very strict.
- If you smile to that old wimp, he will do you the favor.
- He is very unsociable.
- Be more flirty.
- What are you saying?
I didn't say to fuck him.
Stop talking to him so proffessionally.
Tell him a kind word, be sensual.
Mister Fedon is a puritan.
Also, these things are not my type.
C'mon mister Fedon.
You're like a father to me.
And you're like my daughter. Don't daddies take
their daughters on their lap? Why are you laughing?
- Dunno. It seems weird.
- You mean you don't like it?
- I like it but I don't know if it's the right thing.
- If you like it, then stop thinking about it babe.
- You're so wise!
- So, what did you want to tell me?
- There's a male friend of mine...
- What kind of friend?
Just a friend. And the poor
guy is unemployed.
- Apostolos no!
- Go away!
- Drop the papers!
- You drop them!
- I will rip them! No, my love I won't!
- You'd better!
- It's my fault Apostolos. Forgive me and stay with me.
- Out of the question!
- Can't you see? He's leaving me! Help me!
- Give me a break mom.
- She was spying my phone calls!
- I wasn't. The detective was.
- How did he do that? By himself? With his own will?
- Yes.
I will kill her!
- Kill me but don't leave!
- Get lost!
She follows my every move. I walk on streets and
I look around to check if anyone is following me.
- It's because you're suspicious, that's why.
- Go to hell!
- This is not a marriage, this is a spy movie.
- You're over reacting.
- If I slap you you'll see if I'm over reacting!
- I'm doing all this because I love you.
- I don't give a shit about your love!
- Watch your language in front of our daughter!
- Anna talk to him, he won't listen to me.
- Stop acting like crazy mom.
She calls her own mother crazy.
God, where is this world going to?
- Well, goodbye.
- Where are you going?
- Stop asking. He told you. He's leaving.
- That's right. We're no longer together.
- You're leaving me on our wedding anniversary?
- But the anniversary is not today.
It's in a week, same thing.
Good. You'll celebrate the wedding
and the divorce on the same day. Bye!
- Apostolos...
- Just leave.
- But I own the clinic.
- Get out of my office.
- The office belongs to the clinic too.
- So you want me to quit?
- No never!
- Then I don't wanna see you again.
FORGIVE ME
- You're not feverish today, right?
- No doctor, thank God.
Good. I'll come back in the afternoon.
- And you?
- I'm in pain.
- Doctor!
- I quit, do you understand? I quit!
- I don't accept your resignation!
- I don't give a shit! From now on, I don't work here.
- And who will cure me doctor?
- We'll see madam.
- See what?
- There are other doctors too.
- There is noone like you.
- Yes but I quit!
Good. I'm hiring you again.
- Can't you cure me and then quit?
- She's right. Don't you feel pity for this woman?
- I do but I also feel pity for myself.
- Apostolos don't you forget the oath of Hippocrates.
- The oath didn't say that I must deal with nutbags!
- Am I a nutbag doctor?
- No madam! The lady beside you has a problem.
- That's right. And I want you to cure me.
Yes but you don't need a doctor, you need a phyciatrist
or even better a priest to exorcise you!
- What's wrong with the doctor?
- I don't know, what can I say?
- There is no reason to quit the clinic.
- I should leave the country, not only the clinic.
She's willing to follow me everywere.
- She will eventually realise that you want a divorce.
- That's what a normal woman would do.
You're over-reacting.
- I mean...someday she will understand.
- You don't know what kind of a person Rena is.
- Rena what are you doing here?
- George talk to him.
- Are you completely insane?
- Please tell him to stay with me, I'll die!
I can't be alone on
our wedding anniversary.
- Apostolos...
- Mother of Jesus!
- Fuck you asshole, fuck you.
- Stop it, the cake dropped.
Stay calm my love, it's nothing serious.
- Your mother called.
- When?
- A few moments ago.
- What did she want?
She invited us at her anniversary party.
- Did Apostolos return home?
- Why? Was he gone?
As he always does.
Hello? Yes. Don't hang up,
I'll pick up the other phone.
- John, the door bell is ringing.
- Yes, I heard.
- Sorry for being a bother, do you have any beer?
- No but I have vodka, want some?
- How many?
- Six. We have guests and...
Panos was in charge of booze
but he's so irresponsible.
- What should I do?
- Quit the job at the shop.
It's not that easy.
- I tried to fix it, I did my best.
- The asshole hit the break so suddenly!
- The cake dropped from my hands like this.
- That's OK, it's still eatable.
- What times is the store open?
- Regular business hours.
Roberta told me that she can
cover me for the upcoming episodes.
But what should I do if
there are more episodes?
Ask them to tell you if your role is permanent
or not. If it is, you'll quit from Robertas' store.
No I can't. Tell him Panos. The producers
don't know if a role is permanent or not.
- We get the scripts at the last minute.
- The night before the shoot.
What is your part?
Stop making fun of me!
- What do you think Dorina?
- You're like an angel Mrs. Veronica.
- I'm so moved to see you in your wedding dress.
- Come on Dorina, it's not time for tears.
I think of how many obstacles you and Mr. Stephen
had in your way for this blessed day to come.
Those things belong to the past.
- Oh, a man called earlier and asked for you.
- Did he say his name?
Yes he did. Oh I forgot.
Oh yes, his name was Vardousis.
- What did you say?
- Vardousis.
- Are you sure Dorina? Did he say "Vardousis"?
- Yes.
What's wrong Mrs. Veronica?
Your face turned pale.
- No, it's nothing.
- But who is that mister Vardousis?
A new threat Dorina.
A shadow. A horrible
shadow from my past.
SOAP OPERA
"DARK PAST"
It's me. Listen, I'll come late tonight.
I have to iron some more clothes.
- Panagiota pick up the phone!
- Right away mother!
- Hello.
- Hello.
- It's me Costas. I called yesterday.
- Who?
- We did naughty things.
- Where did we do the naughty things?
Yesterday, on the phone. You were telling me
how much you love to suck my thingy.
- Suck what?
- My thingy.
- Me?
- Who else?
- Excuse me mister, who do want?
- I want you babe. I jerk off for you.
Wanna suck it?
When? Now?
This very moment?
Yes babe, I'm on fire.
I want you to be my slut.
Love is a revolutionary and
apocalyptic act and you're trying
to understand this act with
science and statistics.
So you're saying that science
cannot deal with love.
Of course not. Psychoanalysis
degrated love.
It faced love as if it is a
simple human function.
Like food digestion
or the intestinal secretions.
- We're eating!
- Come on now Rena.
But what kind of a conversation is this?
Let's talk about something more amusing.
- Isn't love amusing?
- I don't think so.
- My sister sees love in a dramatic way.
- It's because I've suffered, that's why.
- We are all wounded by love.
- You're not wounded at all.
On our wedding day he came late to church
because he was at a girlfriends house.
- And?
- There's no "and".
- He later came to church.
- How did you deal with such a thing?
When I was younger
I was jealous.
But I finally realised that you must ask
only for what the others can give you.
- I find you very frugal Maria.
- Isn't it better to go for the achievable?
For your narrow way of thinking it is.
And this is why we disagree.
Love is not a simple
exchange of pleasure.
- Maybe it should be.
- Love is an almost religious experience.
It's the dark road
to exctasy.
What is not considered by your
word-centered society is
the unspeakable, the absolute,
the unexplained.
- Finished baby?
- Yes babe. Gotta go now. Bye.
Wait Costas. You know,
this is not a hot line. It's a house.
- What is it?
- The lines must have jumbled.
- So you're not a professional?
- No, I'm an amateur.
- And what's your name?
- Panagiota!
Dorothy.
- Hold on. What is it mother?
- Who was on the phone?
A neighbour of ours.
- Can you give me your phone number?
- I can.
Tell me.
Call me tommorow.
Yes, same time as today. Bye.
I'm afraid that you give love
abilities that doesn't have.
In western world, love
appeared at 12th century.
So before then, people
didn't fall in love?
Not in the way we
do it today.
During medieval times, sexual pleasure
and marriage were two different things.
Marriage was like a
social contract within a guild.
Just like my mother. Widow of a doctor,
and then she re-married a doctor.
You are insensitive.
Why do you confuse love
with marriage?
Back then, love wasn't
necessary in "mating".
Love that overcomes the
social differences and has it's own rules
appears for the first time
in knighthood novels.
In conclusion, Juliet was not
just a horny woman. Romeo too.
For the world, they were
the original couple of love.
- And before Juliet?
- There was nothing.
- Love is a discovery of medieval singers.
- Of course not.
Okay, they didn't discover love
but surely they spread it.
Love is an invention
of our society.
Love is the only human act that
does not follow society rules.
The bedroom is the only place were
we don't surrender in the power of ideals.
- And we surrender in the power of the heart.
- Yes. Does this scare you?
I'm not scared,
I'm skeptical.
You're not skeptical,
you're afraid of passion.
But only through passion one
can deal with the unknown.
With the unspeakable,
with his deeper self.
And when the heart is
carried by passion and says
"fuck me with your cock"
who is talking then?
The unspeakable?
The unexplained? God?
Or is it the ideals?
Excuse me.
I'm in the kitchen, come quick.
Yes George. Of course I remember,
you didn't have to worry.
- It was George.
- He got worried.
- Mom!
- Shut up!
- Liquors anyone?
- A sambuca for me.
- Why did you do that?
- My love, my love, my love!
- Are you crazy? Rena will find out!
- I wanted to touch you in secret.
She follows my every move,
don't you know that?
- I know but I can't resist.
- You have to, or else it will be a disaster.
- You're afraid of that bitch, aren't you?
- What are you talking about Chloe?
Think about me. I have to be happy
on your wedding anniversary.
We have agreed. I have my own life
and you have yours.
What life? You have Rena,
your job...What do I have?
It's either this or nothing.
And I prefer nothing.
This secret life is
not my type.
There's no need to tell me
that I'm not a priority for you.
I was always living under
my sister's shadow.
I always had what she was rejecting.
Rena had only the best.
She made a family, she made
money and she has you.
Could you stop drinking the
sambuca from the glasses?
But I'm not gonna
give you to her.
No matter what it
will cost me.
- Chloe...
- What is it Rena?
- Is there any water in the fridge?
- I'll check.
- Yes there is.
- Chloe he has a girlfriend!
- What?
- Apostolos has a girlfiend.
- She called him on the phone.
- Oh Rena don't start again.
Chloe I'm not crazy. The person
on the phone was a woman.
If you were not so suspicious you'd be perfect.
Apostolos has told me that he adores you.
- He has?
- Of course.
But you keep pushing him away
with your extreme jealousy.
- Apostolos told you that?
- Yes.
I want to believe that but I can't.
I'm so sure that there's another woman.
- Maybe you should visit an expert.
- A detective? I did. He can't find the slut.
Not a detective. A phycotherapist.
Someone who can help you.
- You think?
- If you keep up this way, you will loose Apostolos.
- So you think I'm crazy?
- Not crazy but you have a problem.
You make up stuff.
- You really believe that?
- Why should I lie?
I have only you.
My only family is you,
your daughter and Apostolos.
I don't know how to
thank you mister Fedon.
- You know how.
- Your mind is always naughty!
Is it wrong that I have
fallen in love with you?
You fall in love
every week.
- It's different with you.
- Is it?
- It is.
- And how do I know that?
- What do you want so as to believe?
- Time.
How much more time?
- I'll be the judge of that.
- I did the favor you asked. I hired your boyfriend.
It was not a big deal for you.
You hired him to do surveys.
- Mary, give me Vivi's e-mail.
- Vivi's? 11-25.
- It's not nice Anna.
- You're right.
- You needed Daniel for the shoot!
- We didn't know his problem!
- He has an international career!
- But he doesn't have what we want.
Oh God what should we do?
I'll go nuts!
- Mister Fedon...
- What is it Katy?
There is a problem with the
photoshoot. Daniel has it small.
- What does he have small?
- His penis. We can't do the shoot.
No way. Daniel will be in the ad.
I paid a fortune for him.
But he won't do!
The campaign's concept is
sexuality and multivitamins.
The multivitamins in the speedo are an extension
of the penis. But we don't have a penis!
- Find one!
- What are you saying?
Where we could find a penis?
- Can't we improve his own?
- How will we improve it Katy?
- Maybe he's cold and it shrunk.
- We rubbed it but nothing. I'm crazy.
Why? Were you rubbing it?
- Could you tell us what we'll do?
- I don't know. Put cotton under the speedo.
- It will be obvious.
- Do something!
Daniels stays. The
customer wants him.
Downtown! Downtown!
Yes? Yes, I'm on my way.
We have a problem with Daniel.
I can't talk now. The customer wants him
but Daniel does not meet the qualifications.
It's an anatomical problem.
He has a small...
You know.
No, not that.
No, not that either.
How can I say it?
A small gun.
Not THAT small but it won't do.
That's why I left. I'll go look
if I can find a plactic one.
- How many inches do you want it?
- I don't know. Show me.
Here you are.
- Give her one for beginners.
- Yes.
The enjoyment won't last with
that thing honey.
- Give her a 6 inch one.
- Yes Mrs. Roberta.
We have this, and this one has hair
for a better feeling.
No, I'm not interested.
And this is our newest model.
It's a replica of an actual penis
and it also ejaculates.
What do you mean?
You just add any liquid you wish
and by pressing this button it shoots it.
You can add water, milk
or even orange juice.
It's very stiff. Don't you have
more limp ones?
- More what?
- More limp. Not so erect.
- Mrs. Roberta, do we have limp ones?
- Completely limp?
Not completely. Semi-hard.
We have a rubber one that pulsates
and it's kinda vivid but it won't stick in easily.
- But we won't stick it.
- So what do you want it for?
As a bookmark.
Sex, sex, sex.
Sex is everywhere.
On the road, in the house
at the newspapers, in the taxi.
Everyone talks about sex.
Everyone knows everything about sex.
Everyone enjoys it so easy, so quick
as if they're drinking water.
Am I the only exception?
Why is it so hard for me
to reach an orgasm?
It's the only thing I think of.
I look at people and I think:
"he may had sex 15 minutes ago."
"She may had sex 5 minutes ago."
I see women passing by and I think of them naked,
swirling with spasms of pleasure and I get jealous.
I almost hate them.
The younger and the prettier
they are, the more I hate them.
Why I see sex with my
husband as a condemnation?
And she said with no shame
that she would buy a plastic one?
Yes. The only thing she
didn't say was the inches.
What can I say?
Corruption!
She was a classy lady.
With a flawless suit,
perfume... Everything.
The rich women are
the most pervert ones!
- Mister Fedon is that OK?
- Give me that.
Cut the balls and 1 inch from it's
base and put it on Daniel!
Mary could you stop giving
wrong e-mails?
- Mine is 11-25 and Vivi's is 21-25.
- I'm sorry, I got confused!
Call the personel and tell them
to update their files!
- Allright.
- Undelay!
Okay, stay still.
Let's begin!
VIVI: 11-25
"YOU'RE THE HORNIEST BABE I'VE EVER MET.
I WANNA STICK MY TONGUE IN YOUR WET PUSSY" - FEDON
- What was the message saying?
- "You are the cutest person I have ever met...
...and I wanna stick my
tongue in your ear."
- And you want to slap him for this?
- He wants to lick my ear!
- First of all it's disgusting!
- He's not disgusted, why are you?
The saliva! That's it.
He's a pervert!
- Pervert for calling you cute?
- He had something more dirty in his mind.
- How do you know?
- I'm sure. You know nothing about men.
- And you know?
- I've heard stories.
I wish Costas would tell me things like that.
But during sex he doesn't say a word.
Your nipples are like cherries baby
and I lick them, I lick them...
I wanna melt them in my mouth.
Yes baby, tear off my bra!
- You're wearing a bra?
- Yes, and matching panties with white lace.
- I will tear it!
- Turn it into pieces my boy!
I want you to stand naked in front
of the mirror touching yourself.
Right away.
What do you see?
My face is red.
My blonde hair is messed.
- You have blonde hair?
- Yes, and green eyes.
Oh baby!
I'm 5' 9" tall, slim, with
wonderful long legs.
And how old are you, Dorothy?
- 22!
-The horniest age!
Romeo is the new kind of human.
Although he's not a prince,
he has all the virtues to
mate with Juliet.
With one word, he is the glorification
of the urban liberalism.
So, Romeo was just a city boy?
Of course not but in this case,
art has somehow a prophetic role.
And vice verca. If we
accept that the revengeful
personalities of Medea and Clytemnestra
are matriarchal ghosts of history,
then Juliets' rebellion is the first sparkle
of the urban way of thinking
right into the heart of
the feudal society.
So love was a
political act?
Was it an ideological guise of
the bourgeoisie?
Yes, one can say that.
The bourgeoisie was preparing its
insurrection from Juliets bedroom
centuries before its appearance
in the center of history.
What kind of crap are
they talking about?
Anestis...Anestis may I
ask you something?
- Do you love me?
- What?
- I asked if you love me.
- Yes.
Would you love me if
I were tall and blonde?
If you were tall and blonde
you wouldn't be with me.
Why? I love you
and I like you.
I like you too.
So, for you,
I'm not ugly?
- What?
- I'm fat, aren't I?
What kind of dump questions
are you asking honey?
Aren't you my little bear?
Aren't you my little chubby?
Aren't you my little baby?
Anestis...I love you more
than you think.
Bring them down to the 2nd floor.
Are you planning to keep them there?
Yes, keep a copy for yourself.
I have to hung up. I've got mail.
"I WANNA SEE YOU WRITHE FROM PLEASURE WHILE
I'M LICKING YOU AND NOT CUMMING" -FEDON
- What did he write?
- "I wanna hold you all night...
...on a beautiful sand beach
under the stars." Fedon.
Okay, have a happy marriage then.
It's not like that.
He wants to tease me.
Everything starts from a tease.
- Don't you understand that I'm afraid?
- Here is the ad Katy.
Stathis!
I was on a chore and I also have
a specific lesson to attend nearby so...
- Where is Panos?
- He's at work.
Come on in.
- How is Vera doing?
- What?
- How is Vera dealing with the soap opera?
- Fine.
- I'd better go.
- So soon?
- What?
- So soon? What time is that specific lesson?
- It's across town so it's a long way.
- But you said that it's nearby.
- Across town is not far. It's nearby.
- Do you have a problem Stathis?
- Yes. No!
- You do have or you don't?
- A specific lesson?
- No, a problem.
- A problem? No. I mean I don't have a specific.
- A specific problem or a specific lesson?
A specific problem.
I don't have a specific problem.
And the specific is not
across town. It's nearby.
- The problem?
- No, the lesson.
- Hold, 'cause I got confused.
- I'd better go to the specific lesson.
Don't ask. It's not across
town, it's nearby.
- The lesson.
- Yes.
I don't see where
the problem is.
I lied to you Alexis.
I don't have a specific lesson.
But you have a specific problem.
I can see it so don't deny it.
Alexis...
I wanna make love
with you.
- I shall leave!
- No...
- Shall I stay?
- Hold on, hold on!
- My heart beats fast.
- I'm the one who is shocked.
But I was the one who said it!
- If we don't do it, I'll go crazy.
- If you don't want to, we won't.
- I will still go crazy!
- What should I do then?
So...
- Are you going to give me a blowjob?
- What do you think I'm gonna do? Pray?
My love, my love, my love...
Slow down, you're strangling me.
You're strangling me! Let me unbutton it!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Hey!
- Are you hurt?
- No, it's OK.
- I'm sorry. I hit you.
- There's no need to cripple me Stathis!
- Condoms?
- In the drawer beside you.
- I'm sorry.
- In the under drawer.
We'll fix it later.
- It tore.
- Give it to me 'cause you'll destroy everything.
Let me put it on you.
- I want you to put it on yourself.
- What?
- I want you to put it.
- You mean me? On myself?
- Yes. Do you have a problem?
- None specific.
I wish I'd known from the start that love is
pain and that passion is bitter.
I'm caught like a bird and the tyranny
has darkened my mind and I don't have thoughts.
Everything seems wrong for me,
everything is upside-down.
For me, nature has
been born again.
Thank you. Next!
They won't hire me. I went to the
audition just for the experience.
To be honest, you're not ideal
for the role of Juliet.
Why not? Couldn't Juliet be
short and spicy? Huh?
- What did you say?
- What's wrong with you today?
Nothing. I was thinking of something.
Anyway, I think that it's old-fashioned
for Juliet to have a certain type.
Why she must be essential?
She could be a down-to-earth girl like me.
- Like all everyday girls.
- She's not an everyday girl. She's a concept.
- You take first.
- No, you take first.
Don't end up fighting!
- Can you make yourself more clear?
- What I'm feeling is not clear either.
- We love each other, what is unclear in that?
- But we're not alone on this world.
You're not but I can't say the
same thing for me.
- Chloe I love you, I want you but...
- But...?
- This weekend?
- Yes!
We can leave Friday night.
How long is the trip to Epidavros?
- If we leave at night, its 1 hour.
- I can't come.
- I'm busy on Saturday.
- What do you have to do?
- A lesson.
- Again?
- But you don't have lessons on Saturdays.
- This is temporary.
- But why?
- We can go next weekend.
- I'll have a lesson the next Saturday also.
- You said it's temporary.
- No, it's permanent.
- You'll have lessons every Saturday?
Why Stathis? We won't be able
to go nowhere!
Today also when I told him
to meet you, he didn't want to.
What are you talking about? Of course
I wanted but I had a headache.
I regret trusting you.
You're a ridiculous coward!
- You've got mail Katy.
- At this time of the day?
- Have a nice weekend.
- Bye.
"WHY AREN'T YOU REPLYING
TO MY E-MAILS BABY?"
"WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU
WANT ME TO WRITE?"
"WHAT COLOR IS
YOUR PANTIES?"
Come in.
- What's wrong Katy?
- You asked about the color.
I'm coming right away
Mister Fedon.
- Isn't your e-mail 11-25?
- No. It's 21-25.
Hold, I'll check my agenda.
Where in the hell is it?
I can't find it.
I must have left it in the office.
I'll go back and I'll call you.
- I've heard many promises in my life.
- But I'm telling you the truth.
- What else can I do? What else?
- Oh don't be melodramatic.
- Don't talk to me so formal.
- We're not equal.
- Right. You've got the upper hand.
- Not yet.
What else do you want?
What do you want?
What you're asking cannot be done.
I'm with Dimitris.
- I'm fine with that.
- But I'm not.
We're making a surney for
a new cigarette brand.
Cigarettes? I have never
smoked in my life my son.
- Excuse me.
- It's fine. Have a sit.
- You don't know who I am, right?
- No.
It's because you're young.
I'm Daisy Moreno, the famous singer.
Nice to meet you.
- Do you love him?
- He wants to marry me.
- What if I asked you the same thing?
- I would laugh.
Why? Haven't I suffered enough?
It's been a long time! Why?
It's ridiculous to act like that
just for a fuck.
Vivi...
I've had many women in my life and
you know I can have many more.
- But I'm 50 years old now.
- So?
So I would like -even for once, even with
only one woman- to experience
what is called "together".
What is called "forever".
Even if it is an illusion.
Am I this woman?
I'm tired Vivi.
I'm fed up.
Vivi...
You are my last chance.
Don't you cry my love, don't cry.
Please don't cry.
I was singing about love
for all my life.
Like when it used to
be the old days. Romantic.
Tell me, young people fall in love
differently these days?
- I don't know, what can I say?
- You? Are you in love?
- Me...Yeah sure.
- You are not certain.
I'm burning, I'm burning,
I'm burning...
- Is it closed upstairs?
- No, there's mister Fedon.
- Is he alone?
- I think yes.
I'm burning, I'm burning,
I'm burning...
My first song's title is
"love is a beast".
Huge hit!
Love is a beast
that rules the youth
with temporary dreams,
filled with hidden sorrow.
For love, lots of ink
and blood is wasted
but there is no life without
this beautiful lie.
- So you want us to break up?
- You don't understand what I'm saying.
- What am I supposed to understand?
- I'm not saying to break up.
But, for example, there's no need for you
to sleep in my house so often.
You almost never sleep here.
So does this bother you? I sleep
like a baby. I don't even snore.
You're hooked on me
and I don't have space.
- When I'm sleeping?
- Don't act like you don't understand.
I never said anything about
breaking up.
I just want us to hang out less for a little while
so as to think about my life, our relationship e.t.c..
So as to find my self.
- To find your self?
- Yes. Take today for example.
I'll go out with Catherine.
Why should you come with us?
I don't disagree but I can't see
why we can't see each other.
I just want some time for my self
so as to think. Life is so short!
Why are you reacting like that?
I'm telling this for our own good.
I don't want our love to
be destroyed by routine.
What can I say?
As you wish.
Well, I have to go.
Catherine is waiting. Friends?
Friends.
- Was I late?
- Not at all.
We would like to tell us your
opinion about this new cigarette.
- With pleasure.
- Would you like to try one?
Of course. You never
lose by trying.
- What do you think?
- It has a nice, rich flavor.
- Do you think it applies to men or women?
- It applies to people who love strong experiences.
- Do you think it's adressed to young,
middle aged or older people?
To young people of any age.
- Would you like for it to be lighter?
- I hate light stuff.
- What do you think about it's price?
- I don't care about the value when I want something.
- How many cigarettes do you smoke per day?
- It depends on my mood.
- Occupation?
- Woman.
- I'm not working.
- Are you married?
Supposedly.
My husband is a seaman. Most of the time
he's away on trips so you understand.
- Yes I understand.
- No you don't understand.
A young and charming man like you,
doesn't know what loneliness is.
- Is your husband away now?
- He's in Dubai on a tanker.
Baby, baby you
smell so nice!
- What do you want to do baby?
- Whatever you want.
Be casual. Forget about your
good manners. Treat me as you wish!
Tanya!
- Jesus! My husband!
- When did he come from Dubai?
We saw him from the
security camera and we liked him.
So we decided to play the seaman game.
George hid in the kitchen, I opened the door...
and at the right moment,
George entered the bedroom yelling.
- Jesus! My husband!
- When did he come from Dubai?
- Who is that man Tanya?
- I came here for a survey...
You touched my wife you asshole?
No, no...George! Don't hit him,
hit me instead. George!
Although I knew it
was just a game
I was excited watching
two men fighting for me.
Get out of my house you punk!
- And now it's your turn whore!
- Forgive me my love!
I work like a slave and you're
fucking like a dog with strangers!
- Slut!
- Yes! I'm a slut! Hit me!
- In real?
- You don't have to break my jaw. Hit me!
Punish me my love!
What did you do together?
Tell me, did you touch his dick?
Do you want to know what happened?
I faked orgasm once again.
And that's not the problem.
The conclusion is that,
with George, I can't.
I love him, he is my
partner but I can't.
You may ask why I don't leave him.
Okay, I can leave him.
But with the next one, won't it be
the same in 5 or 10 years?
Eventually you come
to a point where you can't.
Even if your husband is Alain Delon,
you'll come to the point where you can't.
what do you do then?
Do you go for George number 2?
It's worthless because he will
turn like George number 1.
So you come to a dead end.
Unforunately, love is like a tooth.
It rots before you die.
- I hate you!
- I told you, nothing happened.
If her husband hadn't enter
the room, it would happen!
She grabbed me in no time,
I didn't even realize what happened!
I'm an idiot and it's my
fault for loving you!
- For your information, mister Fedon is begging me...
- What?
That's right. He's begging me
but I rejected him because I love you!
- And you came here with a black eye!
- I told you. I was like a rape.
If you got raped
I wouldn't blame you!
- That's bullshit.
- But what can I do now my baby?
You should have been honest like I am.
You made the mistake, we're breaking up.
- What?
- We're breaking up!
No, no stop,
you're turning me on.
- Where are you now Dorothy?
- I'm enjoying a martini next to my swimming pool.
I'm wearing only my bikini suit.
Sweet silence is all around me.
- Panagiota!
- What is it mother?
- My soup!
- Right away!
During this solitude, one thought
shakes my young body: Your image.
You're wearing Calvin Klein briefs that
hardly cover your excited nature.
You transpire the sweet aroma of sleep, mixed
with a Davidoff musk, which is your favorite perfume.
- What's that?
- What?
- That motor sound.
- My vibrator.
- It's very loud.
- It's on full power for you my boy!
And where do you put it babe?
Where do you put the vibrator?
I run it all over my body.
Everywhere I want you to touch me.
- What happened? Why did it stop?
- The batteries died. Hold on a minute.
Here is your soup mother.
I'm sorry. So, what we
were saying?
I don't want to continue this
phone game Dorothy. I'm fed up.
- What did you say Costas?
- I wanna meet you in person.
I know it's difficult but I can't
have you only in my imagination.
I want to touch you, smell you, feel you.
You want it too so why
can't it happen?
It's not only excitement what i feel for you.
It's excitment, it's a dream, it's everything.
I love you Dorothy. It's the first time I feel
something like that, I swear. Only with you.
Please let's meet once.
Only once.
- Out of the question!
- Why?
You want us to meet with a couple for...
But why? The idea of watching me in the arms
of another man turns you on, doesn't it?
It does but only as a fantasy. There
is no need to become a reality.
I know you liked the seaman
game, wasn't it nice?
- Yes, I liked it.
- So why not again?
But how? We'll place an ad on
the newspaper? You're insane!
Yes. We can't wait for the next
salesman or polltaker.
Don't be such a puritan. Many cultured
couples do it. Open the newspaper and see.
- If someone finds out, I'll be a laughing stock.
- Noone will find out. It's confidential.
You write a nice text, you send it to the
newspaper, they publish it and everything is fine.
- What kind of text?
- For example...
"If you want to share your dreams
with a discreet couple,..."
"...we are what you're searching for. We're looking
for a young couple that will be ready for everything."
"Professionals are not welcome."
- When are you planning to fix the bathroom door?
- Tomorrow.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going.
- Going where?
- Out.
- What does this painting show?
- I don't know. It's mess.
Why doesn't your brother paint
like a normal person?
Contemporary art is nice but
I can make this thing myself.
Picasso was drawing all those weirdos
but he had made the blue period also.
- Katy, Costas has a girlfriend.
- What?
- Costas has a girlfriend.
- Your Costas?
Mine? Mine who?
- Do you know for how long he hasn't touched me?
- This doesn't mean that...
I thought the same thing too.
That it's just a phase.
But what phase? I heard him
talking to her.
- Where?
- On the phone. He calls her every day.
Call him now and you'll see that
the line will be busy.
- You're crazy.
- Call him!
Maybe he's talking with a customer.
Please Dorothy, don't hang up.
I'm not gonna ask you out again, I swear.
- We'd better hang up, Costas.
- No I'm not hanging up.
- We can't be silent.
- Hearing you breathe is enough for me.
- Don't pester me Costas. We can't meet.
- But why?
- I can't explain.
- Are you married? So what? I'm married too.
But I think nothing anymore. Not even
my wife, not even my child. Nothing.
In my mind there's only your voice,
your blue eyes, your blonde hair...
Could you do this as a favor for me?
Mister Costas?
Someone is calling me.
I'll call you again.
- What is it Mrs. Katia?.
- Is my suit ready?
- Let me see.
- See what? You said it would be ready!
I need it!
- Okay, okay, here it is.
- Good.
I have to make a special
appearance tommorow.
Good evening.
Today our talk-show will bring
a crucial social issue under the spotlight:
Prostitution.
- In the studio with us is prostitute Katia.
- Good evening.
She fought for years the
cruel world of sinfull nights.
It's so true!
We have also here a young boy but,
for understandable reasons, we won't show his face.
A boy who got trapped in the
nets of male prostitution: Makis.
Good evening.
The issue is indeed crucial and I'd
like to congratulate you for your show.
I don't have much to say tonight.
Tonight, real life has the floor. Makis?
Open your heart son and tell us
how you fell in the gutter of prostitution.
I was in college and had an affair with a girl
that I loved but we were penniless.
- Pay attention to that detail: Money.
- Of course. Poverty is the reason.
Please continue Makis.
One day, while I was at the bus stop,
I was approached by a wealthy man
and he invited me to his
apartment for a drink.
- Did you go?
- Of course! He was innocent!
Yes I did go. I entered the apartment and I
saw he was wearing a bathrobe.
- Makis didn't know what would happen.
- He invited me for just a drink.
- He went there only for a drink!
- Imagine the shock he experienced!
- And he started making indecent gestures.
- Say more.
- He unzipped me and...
- What a perv!
- ...you understand.
- So what else happened Makis?
- Shall I say about blowjobs and stuff?
- Stop!
Not so brutal. We need the details
but with not these kind of words.
- Say everything, but use "nice" words.
- How?
You won't say "fucking". Say "sexual intercourse"
or "anal intercourse" if it's about the ass.
- Sodomy!
- What's that?
Just say it and don't ask!
You should have brought a more
exprerienced one. He is very slow.
How is the...called?
- Fellatio.
- It was at the tip of my tongue.
Don't be nervous son.
Stay calm.
We want all the spicy descriptions,
but without these words.
- Of course. It's a family show.
- Exactly.
I'm experienced. I've been in
many shows. Even Oprah's.
- Let's begin!
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, action!
- So what else happened Makis?
- Intercourses. He stripped me naked
- and did various things. Fellatios and stuff.
- And then what happened?
- Then sodomy happened.
- You heard it.
A wealthy man seduced an innocent
boy in exchange for a few money.
It's sad.
- For how long were you doing this job?
- Four years.
- But I got sick of the perverts so I stopped.
- Good for you. You were strong.
Thanks to my girlfriend, I have a
decent life. We're about to get married.
Congratulations.
Very few people can resist
to easy money.
What's your odyssey Mrs. Katia?
I loved and believed in a man
who didn't deserve it.
- Say more.
- I'm sorry but this story brings tears to my eyes.
- That's reasonable.
- It's tragic when you give a man your heart
and, in the end, he's treating
you like garbage.
- You've suffered that much?
- You cannot imagine.
He was my man, my support, and he
made me a whore the motherfucker!
We said not to use these kind of words!
And you said you're experienced!
I'm sorry I got carried away.
They need you upstairs.
Tonight? Yes, I'm available.
Where are you at?
For oral it's $50, complete it's $75.
Special? Yes I do special stuff.
Slapping, smacks on the butt cheeks,
dirty language, these kind of stuff.
Hey you!
When will it be broadcasted?
I want to record it on video.
You have a really nice body.
- I'm thinking of becoming a model.
- Very good idea! You're suitable for this.
- You think?
- Got any photos?
I do but not professional.
A friend of mine took them.
- Could you bring them to me?
- I'll arrange it.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
I would like this photo
to be re-printed.
- No! I don't like them!
- Why? He has something.
- Yes but I don't like HER!
- She has a character.
We agreed that I must like
the woman or else I'm not doing it.
I don't think I can participate.
Do an orgy by yourself.
- The barbecue man has something.
- You only think about yourself!
- I didn't like his wife.
- Lets choose a couple that didn't send a photo.
- Don't even think about it!
- Adventurous people are lucky.
- Katy, is Fedon in?
- Yes but don't interrupt him.
- He has an important meeting.
- Of course I will.
I've studied linear design and
business adminstration. In college.
- You're over-qualified for your age.
- Thank you.
- Foreign languages?
- Fedon...
- Could you wait outside please?
- Excuse me.
I went to the travel agency and
got brochures for Bali.
- Eeeeh, I don't...
- Won't you take a look?
No. Look Vivi, we can't go.
I mean I can't go.
Why? You had told me that this
month you'll have a week off.
- I won't.
- Why?
- I have work to do.
- What kind of work?
It's none of your business.
Nowadays, showbusiness records
the collective unconcious.
In the same way the dreams
release the personal unconcious.
- Not only it records it, it forms it also.
- Like medieval singers used to do.
Exactly.
Merilyn Monroe, Lauren Bacall, Julia Roberts,
Michelle Pfeiffer are all versions of Juliet.
Also Harrison Ford or Mel Gibson have
extreme similarities with the knights
in the novels of
renaissance.
- So Hollywood is like a school of love.
- It's not only a school.
Hollywood is the lab that produces
the erotic behaviors.
We fall in love thanks
to Hollywood.
So you mean that love is a script that we memorize
unconsciously and then we start acting.
It's not one script, there are several with
odd combinations. They are mixed.
The love stories that amaze us are roles
that are hidden in the unconcious mind
- waiting for us to play them.
- Like actors do.
Exactly.
But unlike the actors, we don't
know how each story ends.
In your last book...
- It's me.
- Costas please, I told you not to call me again.
If you deny to meet me, I'll find your
address from the yellow pages.
- Stop torturing me.
- Are you available tonight?
- Are you?
- I am.
- Costas...!
- Why are you reacting like that?
I told you I was going out.
- And you wore your groom suit?
- It's a business meeting with a customer.
- A customer from our laundry shop?
- Yes, we'll close a big deal.
- What kind of a deal?
- What?
- Carpets.
- What?
A hotel wants to send me lots of carpets
for cleaning and storing. I won't be late.
You are a monster Vardousis.
You're flesh-eating beast
that puts human kind to shame.
- You have a child with that beast Veronica.
- Don't remind me.
A child that you hide secretly from your
husband by sending
it to a college in Switzerland.
- And you know what will happen if he finds out.
- Are you blackmailing me Vardousis?
- You decide.
- I'm not going to obey you.
- You will, whether you like it or not.
- No!
- Call Stephen right now and tell him to come here.
- I said no!
We are exactly alike Veronica
and you'll do what I say.
You won't put your money and
your social status at risk.
And there is one more thing.
- Stephen will never know about our bastard.
- What do you mean Vardousis?
I've snapped his car brakes.
- On high gear he will loose control and...
- Jesus!
- Call him and tell him to come here now.
- Are you asking me to kill the man I adore?
Call him!
- No I can't. The phone is burning my palm.
- Call him Veronica.
Are you Costas?
- Yes.
- I'm Dorothy.
Stay here, stay here. Don't give
me goodnight kisses.
Stathis...?
It's after midnight.
What's wrong my love?
Stephen...I want you to get
in the car and come here.
- Right now?
- Yes. It's an emergency.
- What's wrong? I can hear you are nervous.
- I can't talk right now.
I'll tell you when you come.
I'm coming right away.
Come in.
- Good evening.
- Who are you lady?
- My name is Georgia, you don't know me.
- What do you want?
Don't worry Stephen. I came to warn you
about a mortal danger that threatens you.
- Mortal danger?
- Yes. It's name is Vardousis.
- Are you completely insane?
- Please, one last time.
- No. What if Panos finds out?
- How he will find out?
You are a pain in the ass.
Thank you Georgia.
You saved my life.
- It's the least I could do for you.
- But I cannot understand.
- How did you manage to come here?
- Thanks to the power of love.
Because I love you Stephen.
- I can't resist, what can I do?
- You can shut up! Go away!
I think of you and I get horny.
- Very horny?
- Extremely.
No, no, no. Go away.
- Don't. Stop kissing me Stephen, it's wrong.
- But why?
Because I'm married Stephen.
We're both in a relationship.
We can't do this all the time.
One last time.
I know that my husband doesn't love
me anymore. I know he has a mistress.
- But I feel remorse.
- Stop torturing yourself Georgia.
- Alexis!
- Panos!
- Stephen!
- Veronica!
Why you fucker? Why you asshole?
Why did you do this to me?
- Don't cry, it was just an impulse.
- I gave you everything!
- Yes baby...
- Fuck you asshole!
Forgive me my love.
- Did you at least use a condom?
- We did. Double-bagged.
I was the one who saved you from that
asshole who was abusing and hitting you.
- Hit me to calm your nerves!
- Shut up you asshole!
- Panos stop!
- Its your fault!
You entered in our lives to break us up.
- Yes, put the blame on him now.
- But it's his fault. Speak!
It's my fault!
It's my fault for trusting you. I believed your
lies that we'll grow old together.
I was telling the truth. We'll do
grow old together.
Go away you jerk!
If it wasn't for me, would you be
accepted at the univeristy? Speak!
I suffered for two years so you could
get your doctorate diploma.
I even bought headphones so I could
watch TV without disturbing you!
It's true. He was using headphones.
I was treating you like a prince.
- We didn't even go at the Rolling Stones' concert!
- But I had a headache! I suffer from migraines.
But I was following you at every
single concert you wanted to watch.
I deprived everything for your favor: my friends,
my favorite music.  Even kalamari 'cause you're allergic!
- But when I eat kalamari...
- Shut up!
Is it my fault for being allergic?
- It's not Alexis' fault.
- Speak!
- I was the one who approached him.
- See? He admits it!
I'll take care of you also.
I'll call Vera right away.
Not Vera!
Stop fighting! Stop you're
making it worse!
- No, you're kidding me, right?
- We didn't call you he to make a joke.
What did you do Stathis?
You fucked Alexis?
- No, Alexis fucked Stathis.
- What did you say?
- How you dare getting into our lives Georgia?
- I'm sorry Veronica.
But you don't love Stephen as much as
you should. You never truly loved him.
It's over Veronica. From now
on, I belong to Georgia.
No, I can't believe it.
No Stephen, I can't believe it!
- Fedon... Fedon I can't sleep.
- You can't sleep? Take a pill.
Why? Why Fedon? Tell me,
what did I do wrong?
Just give me an explanation.
Tell me why we broke up.
What kind of explanation?
I don't understand. It just happened.
What do you want to
prove with this reaction?
- I had it differently in my mind Fedon.
- You have a vivid imagination.
I have to hang up now, I'm busy.
And don't call me again at home.
- Was it Vivi again?
- She has fucked me up.
- You're a heartbreaker.
- Are you leaving?
It's harsh but I have to.
- When will you sleep here?
- Aren't you asking too much?
- I was not expecting that from Alexis!
- To be honest, I was shocked too.
- We should see a doctor to explain us.
- What can the doctor do if the man is a slut?
- Let me explain Vera...
- There's nothing to explain.
- Only a doctor can explain what happened.
- It's not that terrible.
Don't judge by yourself Alexis.
You're different. Stathis isn't.
Something's wrong with you Stathis. Maybe
because you hang out with the guys too much.
- What are you saying Vera?
- Don't get it wrong Panos
- but Stathis is young and ingrate of these stuff.
- Let's not exaggerate.
- That's it. A good doctor will save us.
- What will the doctor do? Give him antibiotics?
Try to understand Vera. I did it
-how can I say it?- as an experience.
You wanted experiences? You could
try mountain-climbing!
Well, it's not the same thing.
Every experience is different.
- See it as an experience, as an adventure.
- And what if the woman is a weirdo?
First, don't jinx it and second, that's the
good thing. That we don't know.
- Here they are!
- They came on time, good huh?
- Where are you going?
- To answer the door.
Don't open!
- I don't like her.
- How do you know? Only her hair is visible.
- I don't like the styling.
- Oh shush!
- Why did you buzz them open?
- Could you calm down?
- And what if they're serial killers?
- I could be a serial killer too.
- But I know who you are.
- We know who they are.
We've got their address, their names,
they didn't come from nowhere.
What if she wants me to beat her?
What if she wants to beat ME?
It's a simple lover
switch, not Salon Gity!
- Don't open!
- And who opened the main door?
- The neighbor. Let them leave.
- Why don't you trust me?
My instinct tells me that they are
two wonderful and interesting people.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Where were you?
- Out.
- You're a doctor, huh? It's obvious.
- How?
- The apartment! It's very luxurious, right Stelios?
- Yes.
- What's your occupation?
- We own one of the best mortuaries in Athens.
- You didn't tell me where were you at.
- Tommorow.
- No. Now. Where were you?
- With Fedon.
- Were you working at this hour?
- We were not working.
- Not working?
- No.
- What were you doing?
- We were fucking.
- What?
- I'll pack my stuff. I'll go live with Fedon.
- What did you say?
- I'll go at Fedons'.
I can't hear, you have
this thing in your mouth!
I will live with Fedon.
The best coffin we have,
is made of african mahogany.
Without sharp corners,
lacquered... It's a dream!
- He also have beech tree ones.
- Beech is not so majestic!
Mahogany looks formal.
We put mahogany at my late fathers' coffin.
And he was like a Prime Minister in it!
We have pine tree, Oregon pine,
we have everything.
I'm a wood importer myself,
that's why I have the best quality.
- We also have cheap ones.
- Some want plywood or veneer.
- Yes. Veneer is popular.
- It's not nice and also it's not practical.
- Practical for whom? For the deceased?
- It contains chemicals and doesn't dissolve easily.
So the body doesn't
decompose quickly.
- So you've made up your mind?
- Give me a break John.
- Can't I ask?
- We should have broke up a long time ago.
So you're leaving me!
I'll show you!
Whatever you do, even if you smash your
head on the wall, I'm allready gone!
OK go!
John please act maturely. For once
in your life act maturely!
What does it say here?
- I can't believe it, leave the pills aside.
- You'll see now!
- Are you gonna commit suicide again?
- Yes I will. Got a problem with that?
- What are you doing?
- I'm swallowing.
- Spit them out!
- No! Go away!
John!
I'm not selling junk coffins.
I clean them, I rub them with sandpaper....
- Some don't do a good job.
- Your fingers get stinged by the wood!
Stelios takes good care of the coffins. He puts
quilted lining with moire organza. Works of art!
We will visit you at
the first opportunity.
- That's the circle of life.
- Yes, the circle of life.
- The point is that people must have fun before...
- Before...?
Before they visit us.
- Oh yes!
- Besides, why did we come here?
- Why?
- To have fun!
- Right. Why else? To bury us?
- God forbid! You're so young!
We came here to party!
That's right. I almost forgot it.
- Are you going to leave? Speak!
- Open the door John.
John!
I'm taking pills now.
- John the door knob broke!
- What?
So, I'll sleep with you and
Stelios with Mrs. Tanya?
Why we drove so many miles?
To sleep with each other? Jesus Christ!
- If you don't want to...
- No! You're a very charming gentleman.
- And very decent. I'm glad I met you but...
- What are you telling him? Do you want to offend him?
I am sorry.
Mister George, do you want me?
- The door knob doesn't stick!
- Stroke it a little.
If you stroke it, it makes
a "click" and then it sticks.
- What are you doing now?
- I'm stroking it!
- And?
- It doesn't click!
- She is annoying! She's crazy!
- Calm down Mr. Stelios, please.
He's right.
But you see, it's the first time
we're doing this partner exchange.
It's not like that we're
doing this every day also.
You're such a kind gentleman and
this makes me feel more guilt.
- Don't feel like that.
- You are very lucky.
You're very lucky Mrs. Tanya
for having that man for a husband.
But I'm thinking that...
Even if you fuck me Mr. George how
much different will it be from Stelios'?
Let's leave! You can't do anything!
Anna my love be quick, I'm dizzy.
Call Alexis and Panos.
- And how do we know if today was the first time?
- No, no Panos!
- You could be fucking all this time.
- I swear to God!
Yeah right.
Stathis?!
No. It was the first time.
Don't look at me. I'm expecting noone.
Unless you are.
John my love be patient please.
Panos will open the door.
- How many pills did you take?
- 3 handfuls.
- How many pills did each handful have?
- Dunno. I was swallowing and swallowing...
- He must vomit!
- Yes! Why didn't I think it?
- John my love try to vomit.
- What?
Vomit!
- Out of the blue?
- Put your finger!
- Where?
- Inside your esophagus!
- Where is the esophagus?
- Deep inside your throat.
Put two fingers.
- Give him something that disgusts him.
- What makes him nauseated?
- Eggplants.
- Let's give him one.
How can we give it?
The door doesn't open!
- Let's throw it through the skylights.
- I say to throw it under the door in slices.
- We're sorry for all this fuss.
- There's no reason to apologize.
- Excuse me.
- What is it this time?
Now that I'm thinking it again, I mean...
We allready made a ridicule of ourselves.
- Should we give it another try?
- I'll strangle her!
Relax Stelios, don't be so snappy.
What do you mean by "another try"?
John my love!
- What's that thing on his head?
- Anti-hairloss veal marrow.
- Only marrow?
- And olive oil.
- Is it working?
- Nah.
Okay, try a little more.
Push him back, he'll throw up on me!
- Move on!
- Move on you jackass!
Carefully.
Mom? Mom it's me.
We are at the clinic. John is not well.
He swallowed it all? Yes not
the bottle, it's contents.
Okay, I'm coming right away.
Try to find Apostolos.  He's on call tonight.
Come in.
- Good evening.
- Chloe!
- He took almost a bottle, is it bad?
- It's not good either.
- John!
- You stay here.
- We need each other.
- I'm perfectly fine alone.
You're a liar!
No, step back! Someone may enter!
- Let's go to the storage room.
- But...
But what?
I don't have condoms. How will we do it?
With the surgical gloves?
- I have.
- I see you came prepared.
Don't try to resist.
It was ment to happen.
Anna?
- Mom..
- Is he still inside?
- Mom I'm worried.
- What did Apostolos say?
I can't find him!
- He's not answering at his office.
- Maybe he's with a patient.
You're driving me crazy,
you're driving me crazy...
- He can't have disappeared!
- We've searched everywhere.
- Have have another emergency. Poisoning.
- From what?
- Viagra overdose.
- Go to the storage room.
Ah Vangelis what did you do?
You were swallowing as if they were candy!
Viagra is not marshmallows Vangelis!
They can't find him anywhere!
I'm burning!
I'm burning!
- Doctor?!
- Yes?
Your wife is looking for you.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
- Pull out then!
- I am!
It won't come out.
It's stuck.
- What stuck?
- Her....had a contruction.
- Her what?
- My...kitty.
- The what?
- My cunt! We're stuck!
- Mrs. Drouga...
- What is it nurse?
- There is a problem.
- With John?
No. With your husband.
Dimitris!
Open up.
- They're stuck?!
- Yes.
- They will get a muscle relaxing injection.
- Why?
- How are we supposed to detach them?
- Cut his dick!
Dimitris please!
- How is John?
- Why you care?
Oh Jesus what a shame!
You should have thought
that before riding him.
We don't even know if
John will come out alive.
Don't worry, it's a regular poisoning.
Go to hell!
Dimitris please, it's me.
I know you're in there! Open up!
- What is it?
- It was my fault for breaking up.
Please come back to me.
Please!
- Go home and we'll talk tommorow.
- No, now.
- We can't talk now.
- Why?
Excuse me.
She was always jealous of me.
No! Don't give them the shot!
Leave them like that!
Don't react like that mom!
- Two disasters in one night!
- Not only two.
- Is there another one?
- The alarm bells are ringing for a third one.
- Why is he crying?
- He heard the bells.
- What's happening nurse?
- Mrs. Drouga please.
Tell me, what's happening with John?
- He's not very well.
- He's not very well?
Call Apostolos! I forgot, he's stuck.
George! Call George immediately!
Who's calling at this time?
Why are you not answering miss?
What's wrong with John?
What happened Georgia my love?
- Stephen... My brother John.
- Is it something serious?
I'm afraid so. I have to leave.
We're sorry but George had to leave,
it was an emergency.
Don't worry. Some other time.
- What was that?
- My beeper. Someone must have died.
Goodnight Stephen. I have to go back.
I have to go to my brother.
Don't leave Georgia. If you leave,
you will never return.
I know but I have to.
I can't do elsewise.
- Don't go.
- Farewell Stephen.
You are and you will always be
my only and true love.
Let me tell you that...
I never had an affair with Mr. Fedon.
I was pretending so as to get you jealous.
- My love.
- Do you love me as much as I do?
- Don't make me feel guilt.
- Why?
Because I thought that you
were with Mr. Fedon for his money.
I don't care about money.
I don't care about vacations in Bali.
Nothing can get between us. We love
each other. We truly love each other.
All coffins are good but there's nothing like
the ones made of mahogany.
- They have lining by moire organza.
- Don't you have anything simpler?
I have ones by oak tree and Oregon pine
but it's not the same thing.
- Mahogany looks formal.
- I'll get you some samples.
- It's not necessary.
- I won't be late.
We used mahogany at my late fathers' coffin.
And he was like a Prime Minister in it!
Local community is shocked with the actions caused
by the famous sociologist Thanasis Christoforidis.
Yesterday morning, he murdered
his wife Maria and later he turned himself in.
The interrogation revealed the man
had committed the crime out of jealousy.
The love stories that amaze us are roles
that are hidden in the unconcious mind
- waiting for us to play them.
- Like actors do.
Exactly. But unlike the actors, we don't
know how each story ends.
