This is a reliable link.
Look, here's the tape. 
 Last picture film related ...
... the first picture 
 where participants are shown the film.
- It is not normal? 
 - Yes.
This is a bit of the final product.
This is a copy negative. 
 Film should not be cut and cemented together again.
Someone has changed the last part of the movie, 
 where players are shown?
Someone has changed the last part of Travis' film.
Yes, it would appear as if it were from someone else?
Only one person from that team 
 is still alive.
Oh, my God.
Mayfield? What the -
Okay, okay.
What do you want?
Travis.
This will keep it.
What happened to Toby?
It's like watching a ghost.
Professor Solomon?
You can talk with them? They have a gun -
Shut up!
Travis?
Professor.
But I thought -
Thank you for coming, Professor Solomon.
I'm really sorry.
You better sit back.
Take a chair professor.
Why the gun?
It is a fake.
Oh, my God.
What is going on here?
Toby stole my movie 
 and add closed captions to it.
Is that it; that makes it all happen? 
 No laskajta you.
Step back. Travis, why the disguise? 
 I thought you were dead.
And we have thought.
Tobiah film has failed.
He knew that my good 
 because he worked as a sound recordist.
Yes. I'm not involved in your movie, 
 these fake suicide psychiatric.
Sam did it. You know that.
You gave me closed captions, 
 that I was able to graduate.
So you never saw his film?
Yes. I never came close to his film.
Professor help me out of here.
You know what that means, or you?
What?
I gave you a perfect estimate of the sound of nothing.
Film is a medium made through cooperation.
And who the hell are you?
I have pushed pipe in Travis' mouth.
And pull the trigger.
Why?
Why?
To do this you planted.
Actually ...
... I need your fingerprints on the gun 
 to prove that you are murdered by Tobias and Travis ...
... and whoever it was.
Trevor, do you?
Smart.
Run, Amy!
Get up!
If you do not get out, 
 I'll kill this guy!
Or do you want to die now, asshole?
Come on, before you murder someone.
Amy, do not come out.
It is the truth about dvojèkih? You èutil, 
 when I blew his brother's brain?
It hurt will die twice.
Okay!
Let him go.
You got what you asked.
Do you think this is what I wanted?
Fuck, be a teacher!
What are you talking about?
When I was a student here ...
... the faculty in deciding on 
 Hitchcockovo prize during my ...
... and Chip Voelkerjevim film.
Therefore, the opinion of the filmmaker asked guest 
 odoèilni to make a vote.
Taylor Mayfield, documentation.
That one voice ...
... I was your father forever ruined careers 
 who would have had in Hollywood.
And I was forced to stay here forever.
But recently, ...
... Travis did a brilliant film.
And I saw a way out of this.
But I needed an alibi.
Then bingo.
You came into my office, 
 with some fine ideas about the film ...
... who gave me the cover.
Killed all 
 who participated in the Travis film, ...
... that seemed to be a movie your 
 and that with him gone.
Hey, girl. Whatever.
When you're waiting on my end to what by participating in prison ...
... I'll major in Los Angeles to film Travis 
 under the contract.
This only happens in movies, you idiot.
- Stop! 
 - Stop!
Oh, thank God.
- They tried to kill me. 
 - Lying.
First, the facts!
First, a wild white girl 
 Drop the gun and it kicks off!
- But he is lying! 
 - I said, drop it and kick off!
Thank you.
Now, all out 
 from pokopališèa!
This also includes the immortal!
Professor, throw away the shovel.
You saw Her 
 come from the tower.
- Do not listen to him. 
 -'s Exchange, professor.
You're safe.
This is true whether or not Amy?
I saw you zapušèati tower.
Listen.
But I have not told anyone that I saw.
Mat bitch!
, son of a bitch!
Look out!
Okay, everybody. Calm down!
Okay, everybody. Calm down!
What did you say?
Shoot me.
You're shot Sandrino death.
It's called cinéma verità.
Well done, you think not?
There was fokusirano.
But you know what they say:
"Those who do not know how to be a teacher."
What you gonna do now?
Come on. Shoot.
Reese!
Give it to me.
Amy!
Oh, my God.
Thank God.
"This is my sister 
 This is a real woman."

That was the year boleèin 
 and terrible losses.
And our reward
