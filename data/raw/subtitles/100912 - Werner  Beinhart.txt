When Adalbert Amen
on that memorable autumn evening
the church door closed, he did not suspect,
how soon he would witness...
of a mystery shrouded in secrecy
would become.
Crucifix!
Thank you. Thank you!
He would see what before him
no man's eye had seen.
Hearing what never before a human ear
heard before. Still the man did not know,
that one day he would reveal his secret
would reveal to a great...
To save artists from the greatest distress.
But let's see and hear for ourselves.
Today I bake, tomorrow I brew,
and the day after tomorrow I'll get Werner!
Yes!
Oh, how good it is that no one knows
that my name is Rumpelstiltskin!
As tough as a rocker,
as hard as a chopper,
as hard as a bottle of beer,
It's hard as a rock here.
We don't go chicly to the restaurants
and nibble nobly on the lobster tail.
We do not smell like eau de toilette,
with us you sniff the chain grease.
We ride easy over hill and dale,
can stop us only
a boundary post!
Dengel, dengel, dengel.
As tough as a rocker,
as hard as a chopper,
as hard as a bottle of beer,
It's hard as a rock here.
Do not put the camper there
or you'll have a tunnel in it!
Don't close it,
leave it open, the barrier!
Let's get through this,
or there'll be trouble!
We ride easy over hill and dale,
can stop us only
a boundary post!
Dengel, dengel, dengel.
Hard as nails,
as hard as a chopper,
as hard as a bottle of beer,
It's a tough game here.
Past the cow and the bull'n,
we also overtake the police.
We are the wild ones and we can't be reined in,
if we iron over all the slopes.
We ride easy over hill and dale,
can stop us only
a boundary post!
Dengel, dengel, dengel.
Hard as nails,
as hard as a chopper,
as hard as a bottle of beer,
It's a tough game here.
As tough as a rocker,
as hard as a chopper,
as hard as a bottle of beer,
It's hard as a rock here.
As tough as a rocker,
as hard as a chopper...
Somebody let me know!
- Let me know.
Moin, Moin, dear sports friends!
A warm welcome
to Werner's sports studio, direct and live
from the Zwietracht Stadium in Kiel.
In today's top match
of the Oberliga Nord, the two...
in best soccer weather
the 1. FC Süderbrarup and the host
Wooden leg keel.
There is a bomb atmosphere!
Approximately 63,664 spectators
do not want to miss this spectacle
not miss this spectacle.
Both teams are in top form.
And I can already see the referees!
Helmut. According to § 35 Z II
of the service office regulation
we have before entering
large gatherings of people
to check the proper function
of our service pipes!
Here is the player's
Helmut Hochbein, who was feared by the players,
who hardly hesitates to send him away.
a sending off. At the last cup final
he drew the card without warning,
when a goalkeeper
with 400-brick Ytong blocks.
In professional circles it is also called
called the "red Helmut".
The referees check
the correct fit of their clothes one last time.
of their clothes. Until kickoff
it can't last much longer.
I'll take another look in the bottle,
what time it is.
Yes... Now is the time!
Referee Helmut Hochbein blows the
to the whistle. It seems problems
to give. I can't see exactly
what it is. Uh-huh,
the referee has pipe blockage.
We use this delay
and check once again
the air pressure of the ball.
Second try: Bruno Koslowski,
Kickoff! Yes, my dear spectators,
the ball is released!
Kickoff from Süderbrarup with a
Violent shot from Jens Jensen!
Header by Petersen. Deflected!
Header duel in the midfield.
Who jumps higher? Langmann, of course.
Cross to Bernie Blindmann.
The man with the vision.
The dribble king of the Holstein eleven.
Here you see again: The team manager
of Kiel proved to have a good nose.
For a box of sprats from
Inter Milan away! Take a look:
no sprat too much, I would say.
The defense of Süderbrarup is on its toes!
It rolls over the square from behind,
and look out... Toe! Toe!
Unstoppable! Toä! 1:0 for Süderbrarup.
Unstoppable for the Kiel goalkeeper Würger.
But the goalkeeper claims offside.
Should this beautiful hit
be invalid?
No, the impartiality remains firm.
- What is the ball doing in my plants?
Kick Kruse. A strong kick!
But there... Hand! Hand! Hand game
in the penalty area of 1. FC Süderbrarup!
- Who is doing such nonsense here?
- Quite clearly:
The referee gives a penalty!
- Eckat, come on! We have to go to Hansen's
- the heater off...
- Shot and... Toe! Toe!
Toä. It's incredible. Yes.
Turned ice cold. This is the
the equalizer for Kiel. 1:1.
The toäwart of Süderbrarup
is obviously angry.
Oha! Oh! Ouch, ouch.
It's gonna be a hot game.
- Eckat!
- The ball is arrested!
Bad foul by Karl Greif.
- Here he was just a moment ago.
What does the referee do?
He can not decide for the right
Ball decide. There is great
unrest in the stadium. It is here so to speak
the Lucifer goes loose. We're in trouble!
- Damn, where is the ball?
There seem to be discrepancies.
- Ah, there he is!
- Hands off!
- The referee
discusses with the groundsman from Kiel.
Protests in the West Curve.
I think I have everything, Mrs. Hansen.
- I'm still looking for beautiful melons.
Here. Beautiful watermelons!
- With black dots? Strange!
The expert
gets excited about the state of the ball.
What? Scrap?
You'd better tell that to him.
- Here you go, lady.
- Kick off Süderbrarup,
averted by Kantholz. Van der Huub
is tunneled, but counter-attacked,
Süderbrarup in possession of the ball. Board strong,
how this team in front of the penalty area
of the opponent acts. And there:
a classic bow catcher!
What are the people from Kiel doing?
Are they asleep? Brilliant save!
The pillar in the defense of
Holzbein Kiel: goalkeeper Klaus Würger!
Great! But the danger is still
not over yet. Follow-up shot... Post!
You were lucky. But the ball remains
dangerous. Still Zittermann.
Now he wants to know it! Overhead kick!
Fantastic! And ... Goal! Goal!
Goal! Is that the possibility?
Klaus Würger can't believe it!
2:1 for Süderbrarup!
That's soccer the way we love it.
The referee tries,
to bring calm into the game.
But he doesn't seem to be succeeding.
The Kielers are apparently annoyed.
- Are we on a soccer field, or what?
- Kick-off for Kiel. Kruse again.
Far. Far!
Brettschneider nails the pill
mercilessly against the crossbar!
Header by Karl Tüffelmeier. But there:
the Kieler again completely on the height!
Tingling final minutes!
Blindman. Grenade!
Toä! Toä for Kiel in the last minute!
A deserved draw!
Some players are with the judgment
of the impartiality obviously
do not agree.
- There he is, the chicken scarecrow!
I'll stomp you into the ground!
- Referee Koslowski tries,
to calm down the angry players.
But he does not seem to succeed.
The stadium is transformed
into a witches' cauldron.
More and more players try
in freestyle-catching. Here it holds
no one left on the seats.
Kruse pushes the ball once again
furiously across the court. Attention...
The ball has landed in an uncontrolled
Danger zone landed.
The ball fell on the hot pan in the snack bar.
pan. It becomes bigger
and bigger! It explodes.
- What are you doing? Come runner!
- The whole market is devastated.
Policeman Bruno hangs whistling
on the lamppost, the poultry man
hammers against it and wants to get at his leather.
The referee blows the whistle.
Well, guys, it looks bad with
the 2nd half. The locker rooms
are on fire, the goal is in the bucket,
The Kielers have it
on the referee...
But on the whole a nice game.
Not quite fair, but fine.
I'm already looking forward to Saturday,
when I can present you the 2nd half
can present. See you then!
We switch back
to the broadcast center.
This is Curmudgeon the Rude.
Cruel lord over those in the
Debacle Mountains located county
Vulture's Grave. Swathes of gloom
hover around the tyrant's forehead,
for he suffers from an evil disease.
He has the chronic laughing muscle cramp.
- Chancellor!
Chancellor. Was that a funny movie?
Your Majesty, I am a little...
I'm a little bit...
How should I put it? Overwhelmed.
Well, the one scene...
Chancellor.
Did We Laugh?
Yes, do... No.
Majesty did not like to laugh.
Has anyone in this round
anyone having a good time?
The film, my king,
the film was eye-dazzling!
I felt sick to my stomach!
I had to co...
That went heavily below the belt!
- Everything Satansdreck! Cheese!
Well, with the one picture I have
I was already a little bit bummed, your majesty.
There you hear it!
- Your Majesty, I...
How dare he?
- I am not to blame!
He gave me a guarantee!
- Who is "he"? And from what
what kind of guarantee are you talking about?
- The creator of this art...
Machwerks. The draftsman.
A certain crumb.
He gave me a guarantee on the film!
Yes! Majesty hear quite right.
A laugh guarantee!
With smirk aftertaste.
I ask to believe, good God:
This crumb is at home
a very big number! A firecracker...
I have prepared something with your
with your permission.
A cinematic portrait, so to speak.
Does Your Majesty agree?
Yes.
Water march!
A film document without equal, your highness!
Shot millions of years ago.
And equal witness to a
revolutionary historical event.
These our ancestors from the tribe
of the Australopetics are called in...
the threshold from the
from the animal to the humanverbal
Exceed communication!
Ah!
In a moment, Your Majesty, the time
is ripe for the first human word.
In a moment the time will come. In a moment you will hear
You will hear the first human word!
The primal sound of civilization!
Transported to our time,
put into the mouth of an inconspicuous
cartoon character named Werner.
That was the starting signal for a boom,
as the world never experienced him before!
Werner began to live the life
of mankind in confusion.
No one was able to,
to elude Werner.
He was THE sensation!
Read aloud.
- Always remember:
Do not be sparing with the oil!
Good.
Even in the hottest regions
he conquered the heart of the population.
Let me know, let me know!
Even in the coldest environment
Werner played an important role.
Wern you that you know the truth
things and nothing but the truth.
Then lick your hand on it
and repeat after me:
Yes, I werner.
I hereby baptize you
in the name of Werner.
A name long thought to be extinct
celebrated a fabulous comeback.
- Werner? Get up!
Even the composers
of contemporary choral music
could no longer get past Werner.
Enough! That's enough!
When Brösel, the creator of this Werner,
learned of you,
he set out from the distant
Hedwig-Holstein, extra,
to amuse Your Majesty.
And here we have it!
Welcome, Mr. Brösel!
Howdy, howdy.
- Oh, it looks good!
Good morning.
He looked at me.
- He looked at me!
Hello, boss!
- Don't, Mr. Brösel!
He stands before the king!
- So that's him,
in full life size.
This snoot.
Crumbs, your majesty. Crumbs.
- Chancellor! Does he want to lecture us?
So this dumpling wanted to teach us
to teach us to laugh!
And?
Did We Laugh?
God forbid, your majesty!
No.
Dick and Doof are dead.
Balduin, the vacation terror: dead.
Heinz Erhardt: also dead.
Karl Valentin: dead.
Buster Keaton: dead.
Well? Does he notice anything?
Or does he think
that the plague took them away?
Well done! Show him
what happens to jokers,
who are not able
To cheer us up.
But that's the...
- Him too!
Do not tickle!
- Yes, yes! That's him!
He was always my favorite comedian.
Well? Did he pay attention well?
There you go. We give him...
three days. However, if he does not succeed
not succeed by date,
To make us smile even a little bit...
the slightest smile, then...
Wilhelm Busch is dead.
Heinz Erhardt: also dead.
- Karl Valentin: dead.
- Woody Allen... also dead?
His glasses!
Helicopter Bear!
He knows:
The conditions are bad
for top drawing performances.
Yes, does he have a chance at all?
If my pot goes to pieces,
I don't care.
Splinters happiness or glass,
what do I care?
But when a pencil is broken,
I come crawling back.
To help the crusher,
and what does the speaker say?
So, for humanitarian reasons
this person is certainly not here.
Crumb, be on your guard!
- You don't have to go on the block
from the bloody nuthatch,
you have crumbs, you,
the wonder pen.
There is concentrated power in its center!
Use it, and I swear to you:
The king will piss himself laughing!
But you will be free. So take.
Hey, hey. Not so greedy, my friend.
Not even the Grim Reaper is free.
You have to promise me something.
I have a wish free, otherwise is nix.
- I will! When I get out of here,
I will fulfill your every wish!
- One, my best.
One is quite enough. But the one on Tuti.
So, what is it? Attention, recording.
Okay, when I get out of here,
I'm gonna grant you one wish.
And the thing works?
- But one hundred percent, my best!
He has already Albrecht Dürer
service! Kennste the hare
with the praying ears?
Well! Has been drawn with it.
Good.
- Watch out, my best one. Little hint:
Draw a joke from your youth.
Always comes out well. The king balls up.
Alsdenn!
Good laugh and... see you soon!
Hey, Zatopek, get a move on!
What 'n luck, the master has missed!
Sach ma, Werner, is that necessary,
that the moped is so loud?
Morning, master. The exhaust
fell off. Sorry.
Ah, here comes Eckat.
Eckat. Are you there already?
Hello, Mr. Röhrich, it's half past seven.
- So?
Eckat, my wife is not here!
I think it's time.
Can you look down into the basement?
I think the Russians are there.
I will, boss.
And you do not have to rummontiern on the moped.
You can do that at home, too.
Yes, master!
Werner? Can you take a look?
Behner dir, da liecht 'n Stück Kohle.
Pick that up. And then you can
with the others in the cellar.
Yes, master. Well, Eckat?
Have you found the Russians yet?
Since the explosion the other day
the old man has had a waffle.
Plumbing, heating,
Air conditioning and swimming pool technology, Röhrich.
This is Mrs. Hansen speaking.
My heater rumbles. Especially at night,
when I want to sleep. And lick
she also does. It is unbearable!
Yes, Mrs. Hansen, I understand
the problem. I asked you:
Is with you already ma
a sniffing piece been set?
A what?
- An automatic air vent.
In professional circles
also called sniff piece.
What?
- Yes, I think Mrs. Hansen,
I come with my men
times with you past.
Yes, Eckat! Remember last week?
When he gave the bricklayers the function
from the bolt gun wanted to explain?
Or: Giv me mol her.
Not everyone can handle that!
Lot mi dat mo maken.
Unn de is so stupid and shoots himself
with the thing the fins broken!
Ah! My hand! Eckat! Werner!
Eckat! Get a plaster, I'm bleeding to death!
- Ouch! Ouch!
What's going on here?
Are you kidding me?
Uh... Hello, Mr. Röhrich.
Sin no Russians in the basement.
- What's the circus here?
Why are you eating my coals?
- Ouch!
Men, you have to go,
at Hansen's in Südergraben.
Put so 'n sniff piece.
Unn attach the sink.
And the radiator is still leaking.
Werner! Upstairs in the warehouse
is the IDEAL standard tank,
you're going to get it now. Watch out,
that you don't break it.
Eckat, get the truck out of the garage.
Yes, master.
Well? Look, Eckat.
There's a slider here. You Eckat?
Where did that come from?
- We recently removed it.
It still looks good.
Is it still working?
It still works! Is that necessary,
that he's oxidizing around here like that?
Werner. Take the wire brush
unn make the slider bright.
And then you'll have him in stock.
- Yes, master. Big chief.
Do you have everything with you?
Because let's go! Werner!
Where are you?
- Coming, master, hurry up.
Eckat unn Werner. Now listen to me.
When you're with Mrs. Hansen,
please be careful with the furniture.
I know Mrs. Hansen.
- She always gets into a rage so easily!
- Yes, yes, boss.
So, Werner. We're going upstairs
to Mrs. Hansen. It's on the fourth floor.
Trach du schomma the things up.
Hello, Mrs. Gloer.
- Wipe your feet!
Yes... Shall I pretend, Mrs. Gloer?
Come on, Eckat, the day is short!
We are still here with Mrs.
Hüpenbecker to lay a piece of pipe.
Hey, you lout!
Step the fuck off your feet!
Just leave me alone,
old spinach quail.
Stop! I just mopped!
Just mopped!
Yes, yes!
- Werner!
Are we at a poltergeist wedding here?
Just freshly mopped! Everything dirty!
The beautiful IDEAL standard basin!
- I can not help it, master.
Werner, you're ruining me!
- She's to blame, with her scrubbing brush!
Dirt! Dirt! I just mopped!
Is that too much to ask?
wipe their feet? But no!
- Nu you but once your beak!
We are in a
a completely different problem, Mrs. Gloer!
I'll give you something with problem!
You clean up the mess here!
Yuck! Come on, be reasonable.
Calm down!
Lie down,
We'll take care of it.
Eckat. You make Mrs. Hansen
the leakage at the radiator.
I'll get a new IDEAL standard.
And Werner,
you clean up everything here.
- Yes, master.
But properly!
First sweep up, then mop up
and then polish everything spotless!
Yes?
- Hello, Mrs. Hansen. Röhrich Company.
Gas, water, shit.
- The workmen! Are you coming already?
So, the boss isn't here? Well, yes,
come in. Get dressed
but the shoes off!
It leaks here. I have tried everything
but it doesn't stop.
You hear what your boss said.
It all has to be spick and span again!
And I control that! Is yes
always the same with the craftsmen.
Watch out for the carpet!
Have put extra plastic bags.
And if you want to smoke:
There is the ashtray.
But watch out for the curtains.
I just washed them fresh.
And the heater is freshly painted.
What's wrong with the sink?
That was supposed to be done today.
- Mr. Röhrich is on his way
and bring one with you.
Here I am!
Here are the other things, Eckat.
It's good that you're here, Werner.
You'll have to hold your own here.
My carpet! Shoes off!
- Hello, Mrs. Hansen.
I'll bring your sink.
- How nice, Mr. Röhrich.
Come right into the bathroom with us.
That I am the reed,
every child knows that.
So, now we two first drink
a little liqueur before we start!
No, I'm not supposed to!
- Oh, you can do one!
Yes, but...
- Well, then. Good evening, Mr. Röhrich.
Cheers!
- And another small one?
Well, good. Cheers.
We can still do one.
- Oh well. All right.
Cheers. That's good.
One more, but then it's over!
- Yes, if one more has to...
But then it's over. Cheers!
Has no purpose. After tight comes off.
The screw connection...
is verkriesgnaddelt, you.
We have to drain the water.
Set new valve, Werner.
- Well. If you say so, Eckat.
One more!
Have you been to the hairdresser, Mrs. Hansen?
You look so good!
You too, you worse, you!
Ah! Well! What do I look like?
I'm embarrassing myself! Hick!
- Man, I'm dizzy.
- You can say that again, Eckat.
Hick.
Eckat, Werner! What's up with you guys?
What are you doing?
Are you ready? Are you drinking?
- Nope!
We can do nothing. The screw connection
is broken. A new valve has to go in.
What? That's not true!
Let me mo ran do!
Nah, nah, nah!
Giv me mo die Zang her!
It's still possible, Eckat.
Come, get mo with bie.
Röhrich, I would leave dat.
- Werner! There's an inch pipe.
We'll take that as an extension.
- Yes, master.
Go, Werner!
- If that ever goes well.
Röhrich!
- Don't drool! Dat geit!
It's tearing off!
- We'll see about that,
how dat is about to start.
One, two...
Ah! Eckat!
Help me!
Eckat, what's up?
Call Mrs. Wagknecht!
Eckat. What are you doing?
Pull me out of here!
Werner! You help!
Nu pulls!
- Eckat! I can't hold it anymore!
Call my wife!
Eckat? Eckat! I think..,
we've torn off the valve.
Why us?
- I think it was you, master.
Men! So do something!
When Mrs. Hansen sees that!
How awkward! I'm embarrassed.
The beautiful carpet!
The handwheel is stuck! Quick, quick,
where are the pliers, men!
We can't find them.
The water is so dirty.
Werner! Run down to the cellar
and drain the water in the boiler!
Who, me?
- And get some rags!
Unn couple stops! Unn forget
my rubber boots! Hurry up!
Now hammer the salad.
All wet now.
- Eckat! Dude, get lost!
I'm creating here!
- Ew! Mr. Röhrich!
For God's sake, my home!
Maybe the old lady has a key!
Come on! Open up now!
What are you ringing the bell for at the lunch hour?
- I need the key
for a boiler room.
- What does the hallway look like?
Up, down! Shall I mop again?
- Yes... Nope!
But the key...
- That's it!
Pure Sodom and Gomorrah!
- Hurry up, you grumpy goat.
Mop up! All of a sudden, you lout!
- I need a key to the boiler room!
There's a burst pipe up there and we have to
let the water out!
You have to ask on the first floor
at Biernot.
Oh my!
- And who cleans the hallway?
What's up?
- I need the key!
Which key?
- Boiler room.
Why?
- Burst pipe, upstairs at Mrs. Hansen's!
Werner. What are you doing?
Why is it taking so long?
He won't give up the key!
- The key, man!
We have chaos up there!
Stop! Come on! My toilet's overflowing!
- My wallpaper!
Out of the question, here you stay!
- Leave us alone!
We have completely different problems!
Ouch! Let go!
I told you to let go of me!
- First you do my toilet!
Werner! Don't go into the cellar!
Help Eckat! Calm down Mrs. Hansen.
Yes, master.
- Come.
I have rinsed my feudel with runner.
- We'll get to that in a minute.
Mrs. Gloer, what's up?
There are a lot of other things in there.
Oh, no?
- Oh! I think I've got it.
How nice, Mr. Röhrich.
- Oops! I'm stuck!
That's terrible!
- My arm! I can't get it off!
Let me help you. What are you doing?
You're filling everything up!
Eckat!
- Mr. Röhrich!
Eckat! Werner!
- My toilet!
Werner! I'm stuck.
Eckat, Werner! Where am I?
- My toilet!
Eckat! Where are you?
Eckat, Werner! Come in!
Hey, mo, don't you talk to me anymore?
Eckat! Can you take a look?
I have something on my head.
I also have dirt in my mouth,
and nobody tells me anything!
He's coming back up.
- Great freestyle! 5.8 points, I'd say.
Who has not yet, who wants again?
A small donation for the master!
Yes, ladies and gentlemen!
Look out, here he comes again!
What will he show this time?
Yes! A superbly executed
Mudlords in reserve! Applause!
- Everything okay with Mrs. Hansen?
Have you already made Middach?
Unbelievable. Him too?
Oh!
Well, what day is it today,
folks?
Friday, Your Majesty.
- Ramadan, Serene Highness.
Oh, what! Father's Day!
- Nope! Rose Monday!
Because today is Dead Sunday,
you... Carp,
the deliquent has the last word.
Hey, last word.
We trample through grain,
we trample through the seed.
Hooray, we are becoming stupid,
the state pays for us.
Easy, crumb. Don't panic.
You were asleep, you had a bad dream.
Now you are awake, boy.
Now face reality.
You have a visitor, crumb.
How could crumbs get
get hold of him? Film producer Gerd Geldhai,
also called "Kraken" in his circles.
Become rich and infamous with films
like "Riot in the Maternity Recovery Center",
"Gynecologist Against My Will"
and "Phonebook Trucchio".
This man goes over dead bodies.
Oh, crumbs.
What have you gotten yourself into?
May I ask what that is all about?
- That is the point.
Schulz.
There, take a look.
So what? Can you laugh about it?
- Nope.
That's a great strip.
Great story. Well drawn.
Or what?
But I can't work under this pressure.
work under this pressure. Appointment allergy.
Brain block. Creep nightmares already.
- You signed a contract.
Can't we cancel it?
Let's forget the whole thing, okay?
Good! So let's forget about him.
I'll give you the contract back.
And you, Joker,
refund my money,
I have so far in our
dwarf nose project.
Much.
Too much for a man like you,
to cut it so simply
from the ribs.
I'm turning off the tap to you, my dear.
Unfortunately, you will have to move out here.
No more own car.
Your motorcycle? In the future you will
not even have the money
for a pair of decent shoes.
And now... Tear it up.
Smart guy.
Now dig in.
Come up with something!
I can think of something, for example,
that you have your premiere in four weeks.
Did Brösel hear right?
Premiere in 4 weeks? He can now
probably only a miracle can help.
Watch out, my best one.
A little tip: Draw a joke
from your youth.
That always comes good!
Bricklayers, carpenters...
Zimmerleude...
And none for 'n sanitary area!
Do you want me to do the work alone?
Nah, nah! How is this supposed to go on?
I don't know...
Moin, master!
- Werner!
Do you know what time it is?
- Sorry, master.
My moped did not start. The carburetor.
- Always is what with 'm junk moped.
Buy yourself a bike! I could
me domols so not allow!
Eckat is already off with the truck,
to the construction site.
I go there with 'm moped.
- Yes, then watch!
Well, so soon?
Plumbing, heating,
Air conditioning and swimming pool technology, Röhrich.
Here is Eckat.
We need another radiator.
10 to 160 to 90.
And the gas tank is empty.
Why? It's just new!
You certainly didn't close it!
Ui, ui!
Werner! Wait!
Damn cable! So'n shit!
Mok das Ding uut!
- Yes, master.
Eckat called. You should
take something with you. A Gasbuddel.
And a 160 radiator. Watch!
- Yes, master.
Gasbuddel.
But it has weight!
Ah!
Master?
How am I supposed to get all that?
There's a trailer in the shed.
Put it on there! So, then.
No, no, Werner,
he's not in the game at all.
Is also no longer the latest.
How am I supposed to hang it on there?
Cool! I'll ask the master,
I'll get a new trailer hitch!
Master?
- What now?
I have to go to Fahrrad-Meier first!
I need a trailer hitch!
Man, are you stupid!
Come on, ik mook di dat! Werner!
Use your mind.
You take it like this.
Now look! A piece of welding rod.
And then you tüddelst the here so around.
Because that is good!
- Yes, master.
Nu load up the stuff. You're late.
- Ready, master!
Hurry, Werner! Hurry up!
You know I'm a hot kisser.
You know I'm about to burn.
You know that I always achieve everything,
everything. I am a man.
Hey-ey-ey! I am a man!
Oh yes, remember: I am a man!
Why do you treat me like a
like a big kid? My kisses burn hotter
than desert wind.
I am a man. Hey-ey-ey!
I am a man!
Oh yes, remember that...
Brilliant! Now the
to the construction site only downhill!
That's where my brake spreads. Ah!
Another piece. One more piece. Watch out!
A maniac! Oh, help!
Shit! Ah!
He's giving Toppy a run for his money!
- Really strong, you! Beautiful thing!
5.8 in the B grade, I would say.
Did you bring beer?
- Nope.
Then run to the booth and get 5 beers
and see to it that the things come up.
The radiator must be on the fourth floor.
Don't forget to connect the gas faucet.
Yeah. Nah.
- Hurry up, the master's coming!
Good, Eckat.
Stuck too deep in the mud. I'll never
I never! That's a gripe from the master!
And I have to get beer, too,
otherwise Eckat will complain.
Damn! Where is the brat?
Well, I'll be! Eckat!
Yeah, what's up, chief?
- Are you sleeping up there?
See that things come up.
I see. I still had something planned.
Just quickly up! Eckat is thirsty!
Here Eckat, your beer.
- Have you plugged in the gas buddy?
Gasbuddel? No, not quite.
- The old man is here! Nothing is done!
How do I look now?
- How am I supposed to get the stuff
on the fourth floor? Somehow
I have to pull the cart out of the mud.
Of course! With a crane!
I always wanted to get my hands on it.
Push ma three Kron over.
- Yes!
How many times do I have to tell you,
you drunkards? Don't you understand anything?
I've told you a thousand times
you should wear helmets on the construction site!
That is the rule!
Everyone has to adhere to this, right?
Not so easy at all.
Everything looks easier from below.
If a stone falls on your head..,
what then? For the last time:
Helmets on at work!
- Boss?
Yes, what else?
- Up there...
So, not bad, so'n helmet.
- Lonely top.
But original.
- Oh, but that swings!
Cheers, guys, to the helmets!
Get rid of that shit!
Oh, wrong.
Now there's a burst pipe.
I'll have it in a minute.
I'm waiting crazy!
Wat mokt die Bengel in mi crane?
There, now up with it.
Oh, that's too harsh.
Warsaw!
Oh my!
Hey, guys, look! The old reed!
I haven't even wiped yet.
Werner!
You're a troublemaker!
- Great number!
I'm embarrassing myself!
- Oha! I have exposed my master.
That gives Mecker!
- Werner! How do you put me here?
You can't do that!
- Werner! Come over here!
I'm embarrassed! In front of all those people!
"Werner! You're a troublemaker!"
Want a sip?
- What are you laughing at?
Eckat! I didn't expect that from you!
What an embarrassment!
I didn't mean to!
- Why do you drink the apprentice beer?
Let me help you with something!
What about the main line?
Are the holes drilled? And the
Connections? What do I pay you for?
Schickimicki you can do at home!
That gets me ready today!
I have to go to the site management.
I'm counting on you!
Yes, yes.
- What do you mean by "yes, yes"?
"Yes, yes" means: Kiss my ass!
You'll stay until that's done!
Man, he's in a good mood today!
I laugh about that. Do ma alone
go on. I'll get us a few beers.
Yes, Eckat.
Eckat is gone.
I can finally make my bomb.
There! This plastic bag is just right.
Like this. Twirl nice and tight.
Gas and oxygen...
It's got to shred, it's got to.
Werner?
- That's Eckat! What does he want?
What?
- Come on, get down!
What now? I'm coming!
Yes?
- Today there is no more work.
Over to the Maurers. They give one.
- Yes, but...
But nothing.
As an apprentice, you have to obey.
Yes, Eckat.
Everything has to be ready by tomorrow.
How far along are your people?
They know the score.
They work overtime.
I have arranged it that way.
- Best.
If you wait a minute,
I'll look for a piece of pipe.
Whether they are also sufficient.
- Yes. That's all right.
Yes! One meter... Uh...
One Five Fun...
What is this again for 'n nonsense?
- I measure 1.26!
Eckat! Werner!
Eckat! The Russians are here!
Eckat! I want to go home!
I have to go to bed. I can't take it anymore.
I don't want any more. Eckat, where are you?
It's okay, boss. I'll drive you home.
- Oh, he looks so funny.
What's going on? What happened?
You okay, chief?
- Have I measured myself?
This way.
- I don't want to break anything.
Oha, that was a bang.
Take a look at the top floor.
Yes, that's missing.
- Luckily, tomorrow is vocational school.
Crumbs. You should get used to
get used to proper German!
And anyway:
Where are your drawings?
I do not pay you for pleasure!
The drawing studio
is waiting for your designs!
- I'm on'm way to the post office.
All clear? Bye.
Hello!
What? Hot water bottles?
Have you gone insane, man?
I don't care!
You will deliver, is that clear?
Now he does not have
much time. Only two and a half weeks left.
Should he give up?
- Don't talk nonsense, man!
He will not give up!
Do you hear, crumb?
I'm turning off the tap to you, my dear.
Your motorcycle? In the future you will
not even have the money
for a pair of decent shoes.
Ah.
Ah!
- Good morning, Mr. Inschenjör!
Can ma my
new turn signal system?
Are you kidding me?
There are no turn signals! According to ABE ...
Nonsense! That is also
no conventional flasher system.
Here in the middle of the handlebar
the sausage magazine is clipped in,
and here, by pressing a button
a spring mechanism is set in motion.
A so-called
conservative sausage blinker.
You want me to take that off?
- I want to accept that.
Well, turn left.
Well, what is it?
- Tastes a little bland.
How about mustard? Better now?
Better now? Sausage blinker?
What a humbug! Get out of here, man!
Don't like it? Wait!
My turn signal system is variable.
How about peas and carrots?
Or with labskaus?
- No!
I guess you don't like it either?
Then I still have beet
with celery. Also comes well!
Leave the premises immediately
the premises!
No registration?
- No! Not the bean!
I have beans with greens too!
How about this?
No! No! No!
Hey, Herbert! What are you doing here?
- Hi. I've got a beer can holder,
I want to let it go in.
- You can forget it.
Is he in a bad mood?
- He's not making any entries today.
Fucking TÜV. Always the same.
There was a crazy guy with a handlebar like that.
- Take a look.
What is that for 'ne exhaust system?
- It's not original!
And there, the backrest! Also not.
- The footrests also not!
They should be banned!
- Not wrong, your beer can holder.
My talking!
- Shall I tell you something?
These TÜV guys are just
not completely tight. Zero check.
Want a sausage?
- Get lost, dude.
There! Look at them!
- Protective workshop.
I know.
- Here, Günna! The forgetter!
Unbelievable!
- Unbelievable!
And there?
Dieter! Dieter! I'm stuck!
Hey, look.
The handlebars!
- Dieter, nu ziege doch mal!
Dat is jo katastrofol!
Hey, you! Fingers there times not so rum!
- Trocht rather 'n beer can holder.
They do not comply with the regulations!
- They should be pulled out of circulation!
Both of you!
- What? Pulled out of circulation?
Does not come inne bag, that is illegol!
This is what a motorcycle looks like!
What? Original scrap? That's how it belongs!
What? Chopper? Not with us!
Sharp edges everywhere!
The boys are ready for the loony bin!
- Now I've had enough!
You're beeping!
Through the bars with plain! Ha!
In 'n Won with Marzipon!
They won't get a badge that way!
No use with them, Herbert.
- My speeches!
Lang mo over!
- Go for it! Get rid of that shit!
Beautiful thing, you!
- Still tastes goil,
the oil fuel.
And I also say:
"Crumbs", I say....
Well, that was that.
The final end for the Werner film.
It's no use. You have to
go at it again. Don't give up, dude!
Gather your last creative reserves!
Well, Mr. Crumb?
How are we doing today?
Oh, much better,
I can see that.
You shouldn't try so hard!
- Hey! I have to make my film...
Leave it in.
What a good thing a smoker's leg
can be good for! The doctor doesn't tell us.
But what the heck.
There are more important things at stake here.
Good morning, Mr. Wernersen! Wash!
Brush and soap in the morning,
Increase the well-being!
Make nice waschi-waschi!
Ei, ei, where is he then?
Very clear.
So, nice teeth cleaning.
And wipe the mouth!
So, and now take your temperature.
And keep it in your mouth!
Bye!
Light left on. Bitch!
Make beds! Pillow! Blanket!
What's going on now?
- Mattress! Everything durchnanner!
All full of cookie crumbs!
So 'ne inconsiderateness!
Every morning the same theater!
You've got to be kidding me!
Left the light on again.
Out! Over!
Moin!
Well? You didn't make any pee-pee?
- What do you think,
what the shithouse is here for?
- Well, well! You know very well,
that you are not allowed to get up!
- Take the bottle and fuck off!
What?
- Old toad!
What a cheek!
I'll tell that to the head doctor!
Have I landed in the madhouse here?
Good morning!
For breakfast: glass of juice or milk?
I want my peace and quiet! Lights off,
or I'll bite the lamp off here!
Ah!
Stop it!
- Who does this guy think he is?
The patient has a
choleric fit. Sister Gertrud,
the tranquilizer shot!
- Yes! Yes, sir!
This will be a dose of spirulalin resulfate!
Hähä!
With such rebellious behavior
is also due an enema!
Nope! Oha!
I just want to sleep in peace!
Elfriede.
Yaha!
- I hope we have understood each other.
The visit is carried out with the utmost
concentration.
Yes, Professor.
My last beer reserves!
- Where is the floor wax?
He'll see what he gets out of it!
Ah! To help!
Well, let's see
how it looks here.
At the next pat...
La Paloma ohe!
It has to end one day.
Well, sister? Always out with the enema!
Bye!
Ah!
Always these drug-addicted doctors.
Ah, an outboard! Ahoy!
Hello, Werner!
- Hello, Andi!
They've got a lot on their mind here.
Get us the hell out of here!
Then let's get out of the way.
- That's better, you. Putty, dude!
Jo, off for it!
Where do you want to go?
- Let's have a party!
We go to the beach, pump oil.
- Yes, then throw ma
the party disk!
- Klor, I will!
Yay!
In 'n Won with Marzipon!
Hey, guys! Look up there! Bölkstoff!
I think,
Werner is out of the hospital.
He'll probably buy you a drink.
- I like that, you!
Let's have a drink.
- That's a good idea, you!
You know I'm a hot kisser.
You know I'm about to burn.
You know that I always achieve everything,
everything. I am a man.
Hey-ey-ey! I am a man!
Oh yes, remember: I am a man!
Why do you treat me like a
like a big kid? My kisses burn hotter
than desert wind.
I am a man. Hey-ey-ey!
I am a man!
Oh yes, remember: I am a man!
Werner! Ey!
Hello, Werner! Everything's fine!
We open a barrel!
Look.
He's not back on the boat yet.
Let him crack off first.
It was a rough time. They even took
his last beer reserves.
What you don't say.
- That was the day,
that he is with us again.
- I know what helps him!
A really strong coffee!
Come on! Throw ma your bowl on!
Jo, good idea! That comes really well.
Turn it down. Give it to me!
Flachköpper makes mood!
- Hooray!
No, we are not dreaming:
Premiere! Premiere indeed
for the Werner film!
Brösel has made it.
Howdy, boss!
Zweimo beer with strawberry yogurt!
18, 20...
- Jo.
2, 3...
- At least.
4?
- Logical.
21.644!
- Wech.
21.648!
- Away!
I play cross hand, tip on
rounds black to table and chair.
Contra.
- Re.
Deer.
- Elk.
Asshole!
- I'm coming out.
Very good.
- I'll take him with me!
Finally! There it is!
Strawberry yogurt! Cheers, Werner!
Come well in the morning!
Get rid of that shit!
You know what's even better?
- Nope!
Sugar egg!
- Jo, boss! We want two sugar eggs!
Jo, that's better.
- Sugar egg? Uh...
It's not on the kate. What is it?
- You take a glass,
hauste two, three egg yolks purely
and mix that with sugar!
What does he think? Fried, or what?
So what! I don't know what sugar-egg is!
Stung!
- Come on, pants runner!
No! Cards runner!
- Put them openly on the table.
Get going. I'm coming out.
I can do it! You have to take over.
Take over. You have to take over.
Do not hand over!
I see.
Wait mo. With 3, game 4,
Hand 5, Tailor 6...
Ah! What are you doing? Should I puke?
Sach mo, dude, don't you have a mixä?
- Do it on your own!
I can't do it.
Trot along, you folding chair! I'm thirsty!
Uh, yeah...
Wha... wha... what would you like?
Juice.
- Juice!
Juice.
- Juice.
Juice!
- Juice!
You heard? Sixmo juice!
- Uh...
Apple or...
- Yes! All banana, you plum!
We also still have B... Pear.
- Boo!
I don't like to say this twice:
I want juice!
All right! Then I make pineapple!
What?
You want to make Anna wet?
If someone here makes Anna wet,
it's me!
Do you know that?
W... Why?
- I'll bash your head in, you rat!
I say, that will be fun.
I hear something.
- I hear nothing.
You have to say something?
- I see! 18.
Jo.
- 20.
Jo.
- Männa, from the field!
Buy a mixä tomorrow, you.
Jo, that's better.
Get rid of that shit!
50.
- I have.
55.
- I have too.
Hi there, little guy!
- I'm going crazy. You?
But that was just a dream!
- Oh what! 'n dream?
And this beautiful sound document?
"Okay. When I get out of here,
I'm gonna grant you one wish."
And the king?
- Did not laugh after all.
No? Didn't he laugh?
Would you have even drawn a line without me?
If it wasn't for me? And in the hospital?
Okay, okay. Persuaded.
So, what's the deal? What do you want?
My motorcycle? You can have it.
- No, no. Not that valuable.
I only want you.
- Huh? Me?
Yes! I want to marry you!
- Marry?
As Schopenhauer says: Cut rights in half
and double duties.
So you are, Rötger F. Brösel,
so broad... ready,
this woman standing next to you
with the name...
uh... names... Well?
What are our names?
I think she's from the home.
She doesn't even know her name.
Well, what do you think my name is?
I'll give you three guesses.
So why don't you tell us your name.
Oh, how good it is that no one knows
that my name is Rumpelstiltskin.
Then I see myself forced,
to help you out a little.
Alf is not your name, is it?
- No.
Steffi Graf?
- Never!
Well, am I wrong in assuming
that you're referring to the somewhat unusual
name Rumpelstiltskin?
- The devil told you that!
Ah!
I am redeemed.
- A miracle! Thank you, Lord! Yeah!
My name is recognized.
- The curse is now lifted.
Now things are getting pleasant.
I want to see some fuel right now!
Hallelujah,
I'll open a bottle of beer.
Today is the wedding,
I'll drink to that.
Hallelujah,
I'll open a bottle of beer.
It's going to be a great party,
We're gonna have a blast.
A miracle has happened,
I saw it clearly.
A miracle came true at the altar.
This can not be.
Hey, man, say no!
First have a drink of oil.
He looked at me!
She already feels like a rocker chick.
He looked at me.
- He looked at me!
Somebody should understand women.
Today it's on, but not too close.
It's our way, we like it hard as nails.
Get lost, whether it's a pilsner or a white wine.
Bölkstoff we love!
I'm into any beer.
Hallelujah,
I'll open a bottle of beer.
Today is the wedding,
I'll drink to that.
Hallelujah,
I'll open a bottle of beer.
It's going to be a great party,
We're gonna have a blast.
I'm ready, man, I'm ready.
There is still a little something missing,
then I'm finally starry-eyed.
Hey, little girl, are you my wife?
I was just asking!
Today is romance announced.
You are standing on my foot,
come, give me a kiss.
Get that shit out of here,
whether it's black or white.
Whether blond, whether brown,
we love all women.
Hallelujah,
I'll open a bottle of beer.
Today is the wedding,
I'll drink to that.
Hallelujah,
I'll open a bottle of beer.
It's going to be a great party,
We're gonna have a blast.
What's up?
Why aren't you at work,
crumbs?
I have the option
on the second part!
What?
Oh, jeez. What do you say? Let's...
we'd better get another hour's sleep.
Do there is only one thing: open the barrel!
As tough as a rocker,
as hard as a chopper,
as hard as a bottle of beer,
It's hard as a rock here.
As tough as a rocker,
as hard as a chopper,
as hard as a bottle of beer,
It's hard as a rock here.
