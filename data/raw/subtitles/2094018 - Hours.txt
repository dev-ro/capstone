- B.P. is spiking.
- Oh, God, I'm in pain!
- When did it start?
- Last night.
Is your wife due soon?
- Not for another 5 weeks.
- I'm fine,
- I'm getting better. I'm getting better.
- What's the B.P.?
StiII high.
We can fix it, don't worry.
NoIan... NoIan...

You're gonna be okay.
AIright?
I want you to Iay back down.

Just breathe.
Wait here.
Oh, my baby!
...do think a strong category 4 or a 5...
so certainIy devastating...
deaths which occurred at the cone,
which you'II see in a moment.
The cone wiII cross
right through New OrIeans,
but as of 5 am CentraI time
just, Iook at this storm.
I mean, meteoroIogicaIIy speaking it
reaIIy is a perfect hurricane
with high cIoud tops high and visibIe.
Oh, my God.
Everyone move to the Iobby upstairs!
O.R. Iobby! O.R. Iobby!
Take the stairs! Second fIoor.
Let's go. Let's go!
Sir? I need you to go upstairs.
The Doctor toId me to wait here.
I understand, but the doctors wiII know
where to find you. Okay?
Just before dawn Katrina heads
north west straight for the coast.
Down a hair from its 1 75 miIes
per hour peak,
and New OrIeans buckIes in
for a bumpy ride...
ManueI Diego!
Is there a ManueI Diego here?
Mister Hayes?
WaIk with me.
So, how is she?
It is a she. Did you know that?
What? Know what?
You have a baby girI.
A girI?
Let me show you
where we're keeping her
but do know that we'II need to monitor her
for the next few days.
The NICU is, is overcrowded
so I've got her in a private room.
Okay. So, how's AbigaiI doing?
We transfused aII that we had.
I want you to know that.
Doctor MendoIson

She bIed out.
I'm sorry.
Okay. Okay, so...?

I'm reaIIy sorry.
She expired at seven this morning.
Not Abby.
No.

Just teII me she's okay.
- I'm sorry, Mister Hayes.
- No, not sorry. I don't want sorry. I want...
Mister Haynes,
Iet me take you to see your daughter.
Yeah.
Here at the end.
There she is.
What is this?
This is a ventiIator.
Your daughter hasn't yet Iearned
how to breathe on her own, so...
this is giving her a IittIe heIp.
Now we got an I.V. drip
to feed her nutrients and...
she'II be big and heaIthy
before you know.
You have any questions?
How's AbigaiI?
- I'm gonna give you something, It'II heIp you.
- No. Listen to me.
I'm okay.
It was just a stupid question.
It's okay. It's aIright.
I'm gonna have a nurse check on you.
How Iong wiII this baby
need the machine?
Your daughter?
The best guess is... 48 hours.
But it's stiII too earIy to teII.
You'II know you're out of danger is
when she starts crying.
The first time she does
it's aIways a good sound.
- I'II be back.
- AIright. And, Doctor Edmonds...
with this storm are you gonna be
moving peopIe out?
It's a hurricane.
Look, peopIe are gonna teII you it's better
at Charity, or Lindy Boggs.
It won't be. Stay with your daughter,
Mister Hayes. Okay?
I don't know you.
I'm panicky. It's just going bad for me.
I see a gun and I see this guy going for it,
so I start wrestIing with him
the best that I can.
Mind you? This is aII happening
in the middIe of the day,
right outside of the bank,
in the parking Iot. Sorry.
- That's when I rob aII my banks.
- Hush.
So the driver gets out of the car
and he comes running over.
MeanwhiIe I'm pIaying keep-away
with the guy for the gun,
- but the driver doesn't go for the gun.
- He goes for the money.
The duffeI bag.
So he grabs the duffeI bag,
the driver, and he runs back to the car.
- MeanwhiIe Mr. pantyhose face is screaming...
- He was, Iike, ''Larry! Larry don't you dare!''
Yeah. So, Larry, the getaway driver,
hightaiIs it out of there.
He's peeIing out, he's just about to the street
when this IittIe car comes out of nowhere...
- My car is not that IittIe.
- It's a IittIe car.
It got the job done, didn't it?
- You wanna teII the story or shouId I finish?
- Anyway, I get out, I run over,
and I mace him
as he's getting out of his car.
Yeah, it was hairspray.
- There's no mace about it. That was hairspray.
- I bIinded him and he couIdn't run.
I did my job. And the poIice got there
shortIy afterwards and...
- we saved the day. ...Yeah.
- Yeah.
- That's how we met.
- Yeah.
Oh my god you two.
- You're Iike an oId married coupIe.
- I worry about your kids.
- Oh, we're not having kids.
- No, we're not married.
Abby.
I don't want the baby now.
I want you back.
I want you.
PIease...
Sir?
You can't be back here.
She's my wife.
She's my wife
I'm sorry.
But this area is off Iimits.
WeII, she shouIdn't be
on the fIoor Iike this.
We're running short on staff today,
there's a backIog.
WeII, whatever, Iet's get a body bag
or something, we'II put her in a body bag...
There reaIIy isn't anywhere eIse
for her to go.
It wiII onIy take a minute. Let's just get her
on some higher ground pIease.
Come on, get her feet.
Okay.
Thank you.
I mean that.
It's okay.
I'm sorry for your Ioss.
How did she die?
Giving birth to our daughter.
WeII, at Ieast you have a chiId.
That's good news.
Thousands of others sound sIeep
when the noise started.
It was Katrina hammering away
at the roof, trying to get in.
You have one saved message.
Hey Iove. I know I said I was okay
but my heart is racing and, okay,
so, shouId we chance that out to the hospitaI,
or do we try to get out of town, because I,
I don't know if it's just nerves
or something serious.
You decide. I trust you.
To repIay this message, press...
Hey Iove. I know I said I was okay
but my heart is racing and, okay,
so, shouId we chance that out to the hospitaI,
or do we try to get out of town, because I,
I don't know if this is just nerves
or something ser...
- Mister Hayes?
- Uh, yeah.
Hi. I'm SheIIy.
Hi. NoIan.
This is my turf, so if you need anything,
you Iet me know.
- Okay.
- Okay? And I've got something for you.
It's your daughter's birth certificate.
You have a name for her?
No. We taIked about it.
I Iiked HaIey.
But my wife Iiked anything but HaIey.
Yeah.
WeII, Katrina seems to be
a popuIar name right now.
You know,
ah... Abby's favorite pIace...
my wife, she...
she reaIIy Iiked this tree,
it was in a park by our house...
a few years ago,
it was struck by Iightning.
We'd have picnics there.
She aIways said it was a safe haven.
Because of that oId saying that...
- Iightning never strikes twice in the same pIace...
- Yeah. Right.
Do you think that's reaI?
About Iightning?
WeII, yeah, I suppose so.
WeII, maybe is not just Iightening.
- What happens if the power goes out?
- The generators wiII kick in. We'II be okay.
This pIace has weathered storms before.
And most of our equipment has battery backup.
AIright.
It's gonna be okay.
Thank you.
You're weIcome.
You heard her.
Everything's gonna be okay.
- Hey, what's going on?
- Come on, we gotta go.
- This way peopIe!
- AIright, everyone stay together.
- Hey, what's going on?
- Evacuating. We got three drivers. Come on.
Everyone to the rear entrance.
- Hey, Doctor Edmonds?
- Mister Hayes.
- I thought you said it was bad everywhere.
- This is not my caII.
CaIm and orderIy, pIease!
Is there something wrong
with the hospitaI?
We're overcrowded and understaffed.
The administration just got nervous,
that's aII. It's just a partiaI evacuation.
Okay. Then what are you gonna do
with my daughter?
That ventiIator isn't portabIe.
If they order a fuII evacuation,
we'II get you a private ride to Charity. Okay?
- So, you come back then?
- No, I'm not Ieaving.
If there's something I can do,
just Iet me know.
Sure.
Stop the storm.
Let's move!
Hey! You missed the party, man.
Yeah, it Iooks Iike it.
You going to Charity?
What?
Charity HospitaI, man.
PeopIe are Ieaving.
No. I have to stay here.
You know we're cIosing the cafeteria
in a few minutes.
Do you think you can get me some food?
No, man.
The nurses took what was Ieft. Sorry.
You think maybe
you can get some coins?
The ones on the first fIoor,
they're gonna be picked over,
but if you take the stairs up to four,
there's gonna be a IittIe waiting
area outside surgery.
Okay. Thank you.
They're sending me out on the next bus.
TuIane they got food, but no cooks.
- AIright. WeII, good Iuck.
- You too.
Wait.
Some Iuncheon meat.
No bread, but saIami, some turkey...
Take it, man.
- Nah. No. I can't take your food.
- I don't need it Iike you do.
I was about to get mad.
- I appreciate it.
- Don't eat that aII at once, though.
Yeah, finaIIy some good news.
A Ievy that has broken on Lake Pontchartrain
from New OrIeans.
This is new video that we have just
gotten in, we're seeing it for the first time.
Nothing to stop this water
from just pouring in right now...
Hey!
Hey!
What the heII is that?
What's that?
No, no, no, no!
Yes... Okay.
No.
No, don't do this to me.
Stupid machine.
No.
No. Hey! Hey,

Hey, is anybody on this fIoor?
Nurse?
I need a battery.
Battery. Battery.
AIright, hoId on.
AIright.
I hear you'!
I hear you'!
Come on, you, stupid battery!
Won't hoId a charge.
Hey! Can somebody
get their ass in here, pIease?!
I couId reaIIy use some heIp!
Hey, is anybody here?!
Oh, my God!
The first fIoor's fIooding.
Hey, we're in 204.
Room 204, pIease!
Somebody pIease!
NoIan?
SheIIy.
The Ievees broke.
The streets are fIooding.
The back entrance is stiII okay.
You can go out that way.
No, wait. We gotta get her out of here then.
We gotta get out the whoIe thing.
The battery's oId and it's onIy taking a smaII charge.
If you Iook at it, it's onIy good for 3 minutes.
Move her where?
We couId roII it out.
Put it on the bus and get it out.
There's no buses.
We can go up a coupIe of fIoors, go to the roof
top and wait for a heIicopter to come and...
No. The power is out and we can't get that
thing up the stairs by ourseIves.
We'II have to wait 'tiI the power comes back
on and then we'II get you a Medevac.
- What, so we're stranded here?
- Just untiI power comes back.
Where's Doctor Edmonds at?
He Ieft an hour ago.
- What?
- He went with some of the ICU patients.
He was going to come back with the
bus drivers, but then the Ievees broke and...
Shit!
Pump!
Okay, weII, I'm not Ieaving!
SheIIy Iisten, I'm not Ieaving,
so, think about it.
What eIse couId we do?
Come here. What eIse can we do?
Okay.
What?
I'II go get heIp.
Okay? Just hang in there.
Yeah. weII, okay. Go.
- Okay?
- Yes. PIease, go. You're right.
Go, pIease, but, hurry, SheIIy.
Come on, aIright? Hurry!
I'm toId that the New OrIeans PoIice
put out a caII to aII of its officers saying...
if you have a boat bring it here, heIp us.
But the officers who have boats
cannot get to them in many cases,
because the roads are fIoaded
to their homes.
I don't think you want some, huh?
You don't. It's not good for babies.
That's the good stuff.
That's what's good for you.
You Iike it, don't you?
No.
I'm not going crazy,
I just feeI Iike taIking.
Your mother,
she had a hard time sIeeping at night.
But in the day time,
she was this reaI force of nature,
she just...
She ran her own business, and...
She carried herseIf Iike
a driII sergeant, you know.
She...
she was buIIetproof.
That's what she was.
But at night she had these...
she'd have these stress dreams and...
I'd Iay there in bed and...
I wouId, I wouId just say anything reaIIy,
I'd teII her how much I Ioved her,
and I wouId teII her how
everything was going to be okay.
And...
you know, most of the times,
she'd sIeep the entire night through.
You wouId have reaIIy Ioved her.
Let's see what eIse we got.
Baby bIanket?
Latex gIoves. What are these?
Diapers.
I didn't even think about that.
You probabIy need your diaper changed.
We got daddy diaper directions.
We don't need you.
Go away.
LittIe diapers for a IittIe baby.
Why isn't that working?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this is bad.
God! What has your Mom
been feeding you? CharcoaI?
AIright.
Let's get this one out of there.
Okay. Where am I putting this?
Let's get a coupIe of pieces going.
How does that feeI?
Does it feeI aIright?
Someone pIease get the next one.
'Cause I am tapped out.
Did they give you one of these
reports to fiII in?
No.
God! I hate paperwork.
I'm NoIan, by the way.
AbigaiI.
- PIeasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
I got suckered. I thought they were gonna
deputize me or something. What a gyp.
Yeah, I don't think it works Iike that.
WeII it shouId.
I totaIIy stopped that getaway driver.
- You saw that, right?
- No, No, I saw that.
- That was reaIIy good work.
- Yeah.
- Yeah. You've done that before.
- Yeah, cIearIy.
Maybe you can get a reward too.
For waIking into the other guy.
- Oh, you mean the guy with the gun.
- Yeah, that one.
- That guy.
- That guy.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
What if I don't wanna be deputized?
WeII then what are you asking for?
Dinner.
That sounds IoveIy.
Okay. AIright, but I'm driving.
- Oh, yeah?
- I just figure,
in case on the way we see a jaywaIker and you,
aII of a sudden, get this urge to run him over...
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- ReaIIy? ...You had to go there.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we gotta avoid that stuff.
- You know what?
When I'm deputy tat's gonna be IegaI.
Yeah, we had our first date that night and then,
what, a month Iater we moved in together.
Everyone thought we were being crazy, but,
I don't know, it just feIt right with her.
I don't know how eIse to say it.
It just feIt right.
That's not even the best story.
When I proposed...
What?
What now?
Shit!
No.
You're kidding.
You're kidding.
Shit! AIright, I'II be back.
Okay.

That's right.
Yeah.
Good.

Everything's gonna be aII right,
sweetheart.
Yeah, everything's gonna be okay.
And those probIems are IikeIy
to Iinger, Brian.
The water is a probIem for,
throughout the metro area.
PeopIe are being toId to boiI it
and eIectricity is aIso the probIem.
HardIy anybody has it and isn't
IikeIy to have it for up to a month.
This is your Mom.
She was on a paneI at a convention.
And... the convention
was on event pIanning,
It was reaIIy just an event
to discuss pIanning other events.
I keep this picture because...
she'd argue that she didn't Iook cute
when she was angry.
And she used to hate it
when I toId her that.
Yeah.
Pretty cute, huh?
Let me see what eIse we have.
I hear you.
Okay, here we go.
This is when I proposed to your Mom.
Let me preface by saying that
before I started dating your mother...
she hated the idea of marriage.
She said it was
''the death of the individuaI.''
Yeah. So she pIans this romantic
getaway to this beach.
It was reaIIy a business write-off
because the hoteI was trying
to get her to host events there.
And... I don't know, I just thought it'd be
a perfect time to pop the question, so...
I had my grandmother's ring restored.
They gave these to me
before your mother went into Iabor.
You know.
WeII, we went to dinner that night.
And it was this...
it was a fancy restaurant
at the end of this pier.
It was perfect, reaIIy, so,
you know, the drink order came and...
I dropped to one knee,
puIIed the ring out...
she got mad.
She got so mad at me,
her nostriIs fIaring, aII-the-way mad.
I didn't know what was going on.
She gets up and she throws
her napkin down on the tabIe.
I thought I was gonna shatter
into a miIIion pieces.
That's why I asked her.
''What's wrong?''
And she puIIed out this ring.
She said,
''You, idiot, I was gonna propose to you!''
That's when this roving photographer
snapped this photo of us.
What eIse do I have?
You know that's somebody
I wouId have Iiked you to met.
You two are quite aIike, reaIIy.
This here? This is your Iife.
This is you at 3 months.
Kinda Iook Iike you're Iaying in a hammock.
You think?
Let's see what we got.
Oh, this is when you had us reaIIy worried.
You were trying to get aII your nutrients
from your Mom.
You were doing the best you couId,
but, we didn't know.
This was a month Iater.
You see that?
Your Mom was on this crazy diet,
she was taking vitamins and suppIements,
everything that she couId to keep you heaIthy
and you just kept hanging on.
You're a fighter.
That's what the Doctors kept saying.
Kinda Iike your granddad.
AII action and no words.
Now you got me.
Time for me to do the heavy Iifting.
I gotta put in my hours.
And I'm on the cIock.
There's been some huge heaIth concerns
with poisonous snakes out there, fire ants
and mosquitos infecting the city.
Have you heard much
about how concerned heaIth officiaIs

weren't fortunate to get out.
When you start working again,
