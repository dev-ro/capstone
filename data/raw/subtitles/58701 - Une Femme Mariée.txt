FRAGMENTS OF A
FILM MADE IN 1964
IN BLACK AND WHITE
I don't know.
You don't know
if you love me?
Why do you keep talking?
It's so nice like this.
What's that there?
Oh, that was when
I was little.
Once by the seaside...
I fell over.
Really, you can't
go very far in love.
- How do you mean... I don't understand.
- Yes, you kiss someone, you caress...
them, but really you remain outside.
It's like a house you never go into.
But you can melt into
somebody if you love them.
Yes, but you are inside
people at other times.
when you're not thinking,
when it doesn't matter.
I love you.
You should do like they do in
Italian films. Have you seen any?
The women don't shave
under their arms.
I prefer American films,
Hollywood ones...
- They're prettier.
- Yes, but they arouse one less.
- You've got nice eyebrows.
- Do you think so?
Do you know that in Japan
it's the most important thing?
Why don't you like
me to look at you?
I'd like to have
a child by you.
I've got one already.
- You told me it was by another marriage.
- Yes.
Was you husband
married long?
No his wife left him
after two months.
She went off with the manager
of a casino in Djibouti.
Where have all
the flowers gone?
Long time passing.
Long, long ago.
When are we going to live together?
It's been three months now.
I told you, not until
I’m divorced.
Things don't move
so quickly.
- You've spoken to him?
- Yes.
I love your teeth.
Take it off.
No.
Yes.
- I'm cold.
- Let me look at you.
- I love you.
- So do I.
- I love you.
- So do I.
Do you love me?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
General mobilization on
the roads of France.
12 million French already
left the towns,
fascinated by the sea
and the sun.
Two hundred thousand police were
appointed by the authorities...
for the task of controlling
this massive exodus.
At 2.30...
23 people were already
killed, and 132 injured.
So far, these are the total
casualties for the public holiday,
which the traffic experts
have already predicted...
will have a particularly
high accident rate.
Who's that? Moliere?
Yes.
In 1694 Bossuet published his Maxims
and Reflections on the Theatre:
I believe it's been sufficiently proved that
the representation of agreeable passions
on the stage inclines the viewer to sin, if
only by employing images to arouse lust.
Moliere replied that the theatre
helped to prevent sin,
by purifying love.
When he was at last alone with Mrs.
Moliere who couldn't prevent herself
from crying, he looked at her
a long time without speaking.
His rather too large blue eyes, which were
always extremely benign in expression,
had something in them
as a gentle reproach.
He looked like a small boy who was made
to suffer and cannot understand why.
Nevertheless, the real child was
the kneeling young woman,
who had such an innocent air,
and who could not do much harm.
Well, princess, how do you do?
- I must get dressed.
- We've plenty of time, Charlotte.
No.
And besides, I don't
want to now.
Are you going home
this evening?
No but the maid has the day off and
I have to fetch our kid from school.
- Well, how do you like the apartment?
- Let me just have a look.
Was it expensive?
1300 francs with the furniture.
I think that's a lot of money
not to be kicked out.
You know, you can get on
to the roof as well.
How do you do that?
Out here?
At the end of the corridor,
there's a little staircase.
Charlotte, what the hell
are you up to?
You must be nuts going out like that!
- Why? Don't you know Fantomas?
- Come back at once!
- I thought you liked me nude?
- Don't put words into my mouth.
Listen, I've got my husband all day,
I don't want the same thing with you.
Get dressed and stop talking
about him all the time!
- I'm not, you are.
- You're right. Sorry.
And who are those
two on the mirror?
It's Dullin and Louis Jouvet.
And from behind...
Is that love too?
No that's vice.
But it doesn’t matter.
Each time you use my razor,
you never clean it afterwards.
Don't keep telling
me I’m a slut.
- I never said that.
- Help me, I can't do it.
Not my fault I have to rush off.
On Tuesday it was you.
I was going to rehearsals
at the Sarah Bernhardt.
You don't believe me when I tell
you I’ll fetch the kid from school.
I believe you.
- Ouch! Careful!
- Wait...
What ever is that?
It's a French invention,
perfected by Swiss specialists.
It makes one
stand straight.
The mechanism is regulated
in such a way that...
the slightest pressure exerted on it...
by an incorrect posture...
sets off an alarm signal.
Sounds good.
Can I have it?
THE INTIMATE DESIRES
WE DON'T DARE TO ADMIT.
Yes, I have others. It's from a
Lyons businessman I know.
I get to know many
people in the theatre.
He asked me to demonstrate
it once in a while.
Isn't there a smaller one?
Yes, but this is the
de luxe model.
May I keep it?
It's worth 7000 francs.
I'll give it tomorrow.
If it makes you walk straight,
won't it develop my breasts?
Oh yes.
Now, where did I
put my stockings?
Kisses, caresses.
We stay silent.
It was summer.
Perhaps he's forgotten.
Jealousy.
When does he come back?
What a pretty dress.
I'll tell you.
It's dangerous.
But you're not listening.
Freedom.
Pleasure.
To see nothing.
Why this question?
I was afraid to be late.
Life in general.
What are you thinking?
You know...
You ought to talk
to him again.
He doesn't believe you.
When does he get back?
I want what you want.
You know that.
Well,
do it then.
Charlotte, what's this?
- It's a Volkswagen turning to the right.
- Not before Saturday...
or perhaps Friday. If he
comes back on Friday...
In other words,
three more days.
If you loved me for 3 months, you
must be able to wait another 3 days!
- Too much powder.
- I do as I like.
Women live only for men, yet
they do nothing for them.
Well, I really must go.
- Where have you parked?
- In front of the tobacconist.
You can't park there.
Aren't you afraid of being caught?
There's always
a way round it.
Pierre says it's impossible.
Oh yes, there's always a way
of buying off the police.
In the middle
of the corridor,
...hope.
The image of a young girl.
Who am I?
I've never known
exactly.
The verb to follow,
...other reasons.
I was once.
Not here, a year ago.
Only once, wasn't it?
It's his fault.
Always dream and
then reality.
A bitter satisfaction.
I shall come back
tomorrow.
Friday or Saturday.
He was afraid of me.
I know he loves me.
It's difficult.
I'm on holiday.
As the days go by.
We met by chance.
Happiness. I don't know.
Are you ashamed to
be seen with me?
No, why Robert?
Well, sit up.
I'm very comfortable
like this.
Anyway, it's the ideal position
when you're at the cinema.
What are you doing
this evening?
This evening, well...
I'll do the dishes, and then
I must tidy up the cupboards.
Once Nicholas is in bed,
I don't know. I'll watch TV.
We've got a super TV.
The technique of refrigeration
in the service of aviation. Tele-Avia.
I'll phone you, if you like?
No.
You always start to cry on
the phone. I don't want you to.
Paris is crying as much
as it was raining,
Will he please as much
as it was raining ?
Which way are you going?
By La Nation.
That's great, then you can
drop me at the Printemps.
We don't pass there.
There's a Printemps-Nation
now, didn't you know?
They've got a
fantastic bras.
- I'll come with you if you like.
- No, don't bother.
- It's no bother. I've nothing to do before 5.
- No. I said no.
- Have you never been married before?
- No, not many times.
Why are you always
asking me that?
I wonder...
you'll stick a private detective on me
if I deceive you when we marry?
If all the men you know are jerks,
no reason to think I’m one too.
Lost illusions.
When I was in
high school,
it didn't matter.
- I'll see you tomorrow at the cinema.
- Yes!
Yes?
Yes, yes. Yes!
Taxi!
- Stop here please!
- We're not at Champs-Elysées yet.
- That doesn't matter. Stop!
- Here?
Yes, yes!
When I was still
a secretary,
you called him.
I can't tell a lie.
No, it's impossible.
Yes, tomorrow,
by the Madeleine,
sometimes in the cinema.
I find that disagreeable.
I like that.
Let me kiss you.
In any case...
Hello, Nicholas.
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.
- Aren't you going to kiss me?
- Yes.
- What's the matter? Are you sulking?
- Not at all.
We went to Berlin and
made a big detour.
- Mr. Leenhardt. My wife.
- How do you do, Madame?
- That's your little boy?
- Yes.
I was told you made a big detour.
Because I asked him to come with me
to Auschwitz for a session of the trial.
- Have you heard of Auschwitz?
- Oh, yes. Thalidomide?
Well, not exactly. It's an old story...
Ah yes, Hitler!
Recently in Germany,
I said to someone...
they were to kill all the Jews
and all the hairdressers.
He replied: "Why hairdressers?
Well, why the hairdressers?
Have you got a car?
- I thought of getting a taxi.
- Certainly not.
- You'll come in with us.
- Then, I can't refuse.
Thanks.
Did you missed me?
Yes, a lot.
I missed you.
Is that true. Pierre?
Why do you always ask
such silly questions?
- You're okay?
- Okay.
Did you finally get your
driving license?
No.
Well, I hope you didn't hitch any rides.
What's that supposed
to mean?
Nothing.
No letters. I never know
where you are.
I never know where I’m going.
What have you done today?
Today? Mmm, let me see...
I helped Raymonde
do the dishes.
Then I tidied the
cupboards.
What else have I done?
I phoned Jeanette
at the paper.
Then I went to fetch Nicholas.
- Do you want a dollar?
- Oh, yes.
Join us with the dinner?
I'll have to call at the hotel first.
That's very kind of you.
Did you think about me?
Pierre, do you know what that is?
- A Volkswagen turning to the right.
- You knew?
No, I thought it out.
- Hurry up. Come on.
- You needn't have invited him.
Why not? He's very
intelligent.
I didn't say he wasn't intelligent.
I said you needn't have invited him.
You needn't have told Madame
Celine to go to the cinema.
You need only find
another maid.
You need only
buy the Figaro.
You need only go
out instead of me.
Okay, I'll go.
Should I buy leeks?
On Radio Luxemburg they say that
they lower the cholesterol in blood.
Right. Leeks.
- Oh, new panties. Nicer than the others.
- Just the same.
Oh no. The others looked like
American army surplus.
It's the American army now.
It used to be the Russians.
That actor who was after you.
Have you seen him again?
Why do you ask me that? You know well
that it's over, It didn't mean anything.
I ask you about it because
I love you Charlotte.
- Oh, please!
- Why not?
Not now.
Kiss me.
You must know since you've
had me followed by detectives.
That was three months ago.
You know that very well.
Even if I had deceived you,
you had no right.
It proves you
didn't trust me.
Yes, true. You're right.
Goodnight, Nicholas.
Oh, daddy. You know
when I grow up,
I will go to Australia,
to America...
- to England, to Scotland.
- You're right. Go to sleep now.
Goodnight, Nicholas.
Goodnight. Where are you
going this evening?
We're going to have dinner with
papa's friend, then we'll go to bed.
- Sleep well.
- I will.
How to have a
fashionable bust.
Measure yourself with
a tape-measure,
and compare the results with
the ideal of a beautiful bust.
There's an ideal
bust measurement...
Compare the ideal figure,
with that of the
Venus de Milo...
from the nipple in a horizontal
line passing a centimeter...
below the middle
of your arm.
Stretch the tape-measure from your
armpit to the hollow of your elbow.
Take off a centimeter, divide in two...
Madame Celine, go
and get us some leeks.
- But I wanted to go to the cinema.
- Get us some leeks.
That's what your breast measurement
should be, according to your height.
Measure the distance from
the base of your neck,
to the tip of your right breast...
That should be 20 centimeters.
Trace a second imaginary line
from the base of your neck...
to the tip of your
left breast.
An imaginary line...
20 centimeters.
Measure the distance between the tips
of your two breasts. 20 centimeters.
These three measurements should
form an equilateral triangle.
Pierre, what does 'equilateral' mean?
I don't know.
Brown or green?
Green.
- I'll put it in the bedroom.
- Okay.
I told you not to use my Philips, you
used it to shave your legs and thighs.
It wasn't me. It was
Nicholas playing with it.
Not true! It was mummy!
Not true! It was mummy!
Not true! It was mummy!
- You see, you're lying.
- Why should I? It's a nasty thing.
- You do sometimes, and
I’ve become suspicious.
You've no right to say that.
You know very well
what I’m talking about.
It doesn't seem as though
you've forgiven me.
It wasn't very hard.
Anyway I owed you a slap.
Not at all. I was a slap ahead.
Now we're back to scratch again.
- Come here.
- No!
- I won't hurt you.
- Not now, he's waiting for us.
Where do you begin
Where does the image
I have of you end?
How do I distinguish between the
reality and the desire I have for it?
You need only know
what is behind my eyes.
What is behind your eyes?
Each time you come back from a trip,
you ask me complicated questions.
But I love you...
and perhaps love
itself is complicated.
I love you too, Pierre.
Often not in the way you
think, but it's sincere.
We've got to go.
I didn't imagine your flats
would be like this.
It's unexpected, this setting,
only twenty minutes from Paris.
Places do exist which haven't
been touched by our time.
Living away from the noise
of the capital is a dream.
Provided you breath in the
rhythm with the nature...
as it was formed by past ages.
Money cannot replace time when
it comes to trees and plants.
It's the 'escape' flat,
an expression of the intent to build
for man on the same scale as man.
You'll notice that houses
are spread around three parks,
which slope down gently
towards the Seine,
facing the magnificent
Marly forest.
It's very well suited to
human needs, isn't it?
We experience exceptional
moments here every day.
Eight windows opening
onto lawns,
and a walk in one's
garden in the evening.
That's really the life people
were meant to live.
Everything here is of
the highest quality.
From outside, you'll notice the
elegant façade of the building,
a mixture of blocks of stone, mosaic
and varnished mahogany.
Then I’ll show you
the bathroom.
In it can be found not only
thermostatically controlled mixer-taps,
but also a dressing table any
woman would be happy to linger.
- One of two lumps of sugar?
- None, please.
Have you seen
my new TV?
No, ah! A Tele-Avia.
The technique of aviation
in the service of television.
Do you know I flew from
Düsseldorf to Rheims...
with the automatic pilot?
- The new one?
- Yes.
What use are you
if it's automatic?
At any rate, it has a better
memory than I have.
It's fantastic when you think that first
thing we teach a machine is memory.
To record the past.
The past isn't worth the trouble.
The present is the important thing.
MEMORY
No, for me...
memory is one of the
most important things.
But it's so incredible,
when I was in Germany,
I was at the Auschwitz
trial for a few days.
Well,
there were people
accused of, I don't know,
having killed thousands
of people.
And they didn't
remember a thing.
Well, perhaps that was
because, I don't know, perhaps...
it was a defense
mechanism,
but with some of them one had the
impression that they had just forgotten.
Speaking of memory,
remember when I was in
Italy with Mr. Rossellini?
Well,
he told me a story.
For him, it was really
the funniest story out.
One day on the
Champs-Elysees,
he saw a procession
of deported people.
You know,
men who had
dressed up in their...
old camp uniforms,
striped pyjamas.
This was ten years later.
Obviously they weren't as
thin as skeletons like when...
they came out of Dachau,
or Mauthausen.
They had been eating,
making money,
living a normal life,
they'd put on weight.
It just didn't look
right on them.
Mr. Rossellini thought it was really
funny because those men..
remembered all wrong. They didn't
remember that they had changed.
Me,
I can't forget,
no matter what.
I remember everything.
I can remember
my first flight,
or my holidays
in Britain.
The first time I met
you, remember?
I can remember everything,
even how I was dressed.
Of course, there are things
I’d like to remember, but...
Memory, all that, is no
good. I prefer present.
It's more...
present is more exiting.
I like music. I like
the things that perish,
- I like flowers, I like...
- That makes me think.
Love...
Love. You have to live it.
You have to live in the present,
Because if there
is no present,
it can't live, it dies.
The most important
thing for me...
is to understand
what's happening,
Well, to understand
what goes on,
and to try to...
compare it to...
everything that I’ve known,
that I’ve seen in the others...
Its' difficult, difficult in the present.
That's why I like it, because,
during the present, I have no
time to reflect, I can't think.
Pardon?
No, I can't understand.
I can't understand
the present,
it's stronger than me.
Of course, the thing I love,
that which fascinates me,
is this...
is this element that escapes me,
that I can't control in the present.
That's what I
like about it.
I'd like to control it. Because I can't
help thinking and I’m not an animal.
Sometimes, I’m sorry
I’m not, I like animals.
They're so natural, their movements...
they're always beautiful.
But we're supposed
to understand...
Well, am I happy?
No, I’m not
happy because,
because,
precisely because I have
no life in the present.
Because,
I’m quite clear
in myself,
I’m not surprised by anything
that happens to me.
Yes, yes, they're lots of
things I’m ashamed of.
Precisely because,
when they happened,
I wasn't...
I wasn't able to
prepare myself.
And I was ashamed
afterwards.
I was ashamed because I couldn't
realize that I shouldn't have done it.
But while it was happening, no.
Not during the present.
Because in the present,
I can't, it escapes me...
I don't know
what's happening.
The present keeps
one from going mad.
INTELLIGENCE
It's curious how
certain words...
that had no importance when
you first heard them take on...
after a certain time, an almost
central significance. I'm thinking of...
something a friend
of mine said to me...
25 years ago, in 1940,
during the collapse,
in Vichy.
He was a man of
great courage,
witty, one of the first
to join the Resistance.
But before taking sides, he wanted
to come to Vichy to see for himself.
"You see" he told me,
"I am a man who likes to
understand before I affirm."
This man, who had a beautiful
name, Emmanuel,
was not like me at all.
But his aphorism,
has become a sort of personal motto
to me, which I say as a joke,
but which, I believe, is the most
serious definition of intelligence.
Intelligence is to understand
before affirming.
It means one seeks to
go beyond an idea,
to find its limits, to find its opposite,
consequently to understand others.
To seek out a little path between "for"
and "against", oneself and the others.
I know, not everybody finds
this morality of the intellect...
sympathetic, especially
not today;
when people like primary colors and find
it grey to hunt for the nuances between...
black and white, but I must confess,
it's the fanatics, the dogmatists...
who are the boring ones, one always
knows in advance what they will say,
On the contrary, people who
are not so much sceptical...
as fond of paradoxes are amusing,
and the essence of paradox is...
to look for the opposite in the face
of what seems a self-evident idea.
And then today, we also need
the word "compromise",
one of the most beautiful and
courageous of intellectual acts.
It has become a pejorative word,
meaning lack of conviction.
But for myself, I am
going to carry on...
thinking that one has to seek for
a synthesis, and I’ll continue to say...
that the world's not that
simple, nor totally absurd.
It's precisely the role of intelligence
to seek to what degree one can put...
a bit of reason
into this absurdity.
Do you know Madame, that despite
your light brown hair, you reminded...
me of a beautiful redhead. 'La Jolie
Rousse' is a poem by Apollinaire.
'Sun, the time has come for
the flaming reason'
Well, that flaming reason
the poet is looking for,
when it appears, takes the
form of a beautiful redhead.
That's what can be seen
on a woman's face,
the presence of intellectual awareness
that gives her a different beauty.
Feminine beauty becomes something
all-powerful, and it's for that reason
I believe, that all the great ideas in
French are in the feminine gender.
That there are statues called 'La Vertu',
'La Republique', 'La France'.
I see it's ridiculous to make this little
speech on philosophy this evening,
but I do ask you to believe, firstly,
that it is sincere, and second,
not because I’m growing old that I make
this declaration of intellectual prudence.
On the contrary, when I was 20,
I was more open to others,
and it's now that at 60, one wants to
give one's intellect a holiday sometimes,
that humanism becomes a heavy burden
and one desires to do foolish things.
I don't know I’ll manage to do it, but
we should love wise young people...
and mad old ones.
CHILDHOOD
For the job. First,
you think about it.
Second, you calculate.
Third, you warn everybody.
Fourth, you do it.
Fifth,
you buy the paint.
Sixth,
you check everything.
Seventh, you paint it.
Eighth, you recheck
everything.
Ninth, you add the
finishing touches.
Tenth, you set
it in motion.
What are this records?
A chap at West Berlin gave them for
one of his friends in N.A.T.O. here.
- I'd like to hear that one.
- No, they're not ours.
- Charlotte, no!
- Listen, It doesn't hurt them.
Listen!
I'm thirsty.
- I want to put on another.
- No, that's enough.
Yes!
I told you, they aren't ours.
Put it down...
- or I’ll rape you.
- Stop it! Are you crazy?
- No, you're very beautiful.
- No.
You'll run for your money!
- You're crazy!
- I told you they weren't ours!
Who's that?
That? I don't know.
It's classical music.
Can I put it on?
- Yes, if you're nice.
- I will.
You know I don't like that.
Did you miss me?
I'm sorry...
in the darkness.
Why?
Gently...
It's too complicated...
I'm afraid. My love...
I'm sad.
The water is cold.
I shut my eyes.
Because...
Yes, I remember it.
Always like that.
He looked into
my eyes.
Besides, it's not
your fault.
There's one little thing.
I bought myself
a new dress.
He doesn't talk.
A week afterwards.
When we are dead.
With lassitude.
Our legs and
my thighs.
It doesn't matter.
All these awful scenes.
Don't be like that.
I have loved you.
Weakness.
Truth.
I want to know.
I'll explain to you.
He left quickly.
On the contrary.
There.
I promised you.
Once again.
Like before.
To regret.
On that evening.
On that evening.
Nothing had ever...
Love...
Of infinite sadness,
Love is like the day.
It fades, fades away,
Love is like the day.
Of infinite tenderness,
Love is like the day.
It comes back,
it comes back.
Love is like the day.
- Are we going on holiday this year?
- That depends. I don't know yet.
Did I tell you, last Tuesday I met the guy
who met you at the Club Mediterranee?
- A Canadian?
- Yes.
Yes, he was a creep.
He was after you.
You knew that when I met you,
you were the second, not the first.
You seem upset.
No, that's alright.
It's odd, men will allow for themselves
which they won't allow for women.
It was a silly thing to do,
to rape me and to slap me.
It's not the way to make
me be nice to you.
I'm sorry.
You're always saying that, but
you don't ever forgive yourself.
I do sometimes.
You can go fast in your plane...
- Emotions aren't like that.
- I agree.
- Don't exaggerate.
- I agree.
If I asked you what your faults
were, what would you say?
Why? I'd rather tell you my qualities.
No.
It's your faults that
I’m interested in.
Pride.
Impatience.
My love for you.
For me, it's laziness,
untruthfulness,
no, not so much laziness.
But I haven't any
will power.
Take off your nightie.
No, I’ll be cold.
You said that
you'd be nice.
Why can't I peek
at you any more?
What does "peek"
exactly mean?
I don't know, "peak" maybe,
the height of curiosity.
If it's high, then it
must be precious.
You're sad all
of a sudden.
Yes.
- Because of me?
- No.
Because of people.
What do you mean?
I don't know. Everybody.
Everybody on the street.
I'd like to get to
know them all...
That one, that one...
...that one.
That one may
die tomorrow.
He's waiting for a telephone
call before killing himself.
But no one calls,
so he kills himself.
We're all guilty.
I'll always be here.
What film was it in?
There was a sailor
and a little girl...
He took her in his arms, and
turned her around and around,
it was done very,
very slowly.
Oh yes, in slow motion.
I don't know.
It was beautiful.
How do they do that?
I don't know.
Cinema is a mystery.
When are we going
to have a child?
You've already got one.
But I’d like to have
a child by you.
Have you been thinking
about it long?
Ever since I’ve
known you.
I'm happy, I’m happy,
I’m happy, I’m happy...
I'm happy, I’m happy...
I said you weren't to
phone me at home.
At Marseilles! What will you
do at Marseilles?
Berenice.
There's no cinema at Orly.
Alright, 4:45-5:00 o'clock
at the cinema at Orly.
Seat no 12, okey.
I kiss you, too.
Hello, is that Dr. Deotot?
Good morning, doctor. This is
Madame Giraud speaking.
I wanted to ask you, could I come
at 3:30 instead of 3:00.
because I’m working today and I don't
think I’ll have finished by 3:00.
Good, thank you.
Have you got the results?
Thank you, doctor,
see you this afternoon.
Not to be...
It's for you!
Tell them I’ve already
gone out!
It's your husband.
What does he want?
He says he's waking
you as he promised,
He wants to know if you're
meeting him for lunch.
He says it'll be difficult,
he only has half an hour.
Right, tell him I’ll come and fetch him
tonight and send him a kiss from me.
Madame, what does
"equilateral" mean?
Raymonde, how many times have I told
you not to touch my papers and things?
And how many times have I told you to
call me Madame Celine, not by my name?
If Madame Leroy calls, tell her I’m going
straight to the pool, I won't go to office.
Madame, what does
"equilateral" mean?
Why?
Are you interested?
- But you've nice breasts.
- I use Peruvian Serum.
- What's that?
- Wait, I’ll show you.
Exclusive. How to double
the size of your breasts.
The answer is the
Peruvian Serum.
The secret of beautiful breasts
is revealed. By whom?
Peruvian doctors were the originators
of this fabulous discovery.
Thanks to Peruvian Serum,
You'll notice rapid results, regardless
of age and shape of breasts,
an overwhelming increase
in size, graceful reshaping.
Give your husband
a delightful surprise.
And your husband,
was he satisfied ?
What a bout!
Oh yes, the blokes want
to have it all night.
They shout, they bawl...
The dirty brutes...
So I lie with him
on top of me,
he is so fat!
I'm in my favourite position.
He sweeps me down
like whirlwind,
I feel a shock running
through my body.
I want to get free.
I wriggle, I kick,
I crawl over my
own wreckage.
My tits are pulverized.
I can't find a place
to breathe.
I collapse under his kisses.
My ass...
Spasms...
I push my tongue
down his throat...
as far it'll go, to stop
him crying out.
I push my fingers
in any hole I can.
I use all my energy,
but he's got me
just the same.
So I let myself go,
he goes wild.
His great swollen hands
grab my arse from behind.
I want to tie him up so that
he just stops jiggling.
Then, it's over.
Marvelous.
I'm just one solid
mass of beauty.
Oh, love!
The only true
joy in the world.
The only deliverance,
the only truth.
Oh, harmony!
DEATH ON THE
INSTALLMENT PLAN
To find harmony!
Like at the cinema.
The sky is blue.
Abolish the past.
Put on lipstick.
What are you thinking?
I'm hesitating.
The day after.
He didn't know.
In the clouds.
Get undressed.
If I were you,
I wouldn't go.
The evening of
the day after.
Tuesday afternoon.
Very rapidly.
For several days.
In January 1964.
I think it's fun.
It's alive.
Freed from that hope.
Nothing had changed.
One last time.
The new apartment.
The phone rings.
It's lovely weather.
Not to him,
not to anyone.
Why should I?
We'll go where you like.
It had stopped raining.
We heard nothing.
One must choose.
At first I said nothing.
What's the matter?
Tenderness.
Obviously.
All imaginable suffering.
A face bathed in tears.
Stroking my hair.
I remained silent.
To look around one.
- Will you drop me at Trocadero?
- Yes, after I make some phone calls.
Ok, I’ll wait for
you in the bar.
The sun, Uranus and Saturn will help you
to decide about very important projects.
Be careful with someone who may
feel betrayed and be jealous.
Adopt a passive attitude, the situation
is complex and uncertain.
It's vital to overcome your anxiety
or your dissatisfaction.
Do not let yourself give way to
discouragement or depression.
Will you lend it to me?
Thanks.
- Have you seen this girl with a 'monokini'?
- What's that?
Those swimming suits with
no top, just braces... Look!
She must feel hot
and cold all over!
- They are nice. Wouldn't you wear one?
- No, never.
But why not wear it,
if that's the fashion.
You've seen how
they make that, too.
Yes, they also put
flowers on the navel.
- Topless, just on the navel?
- Yes, I’ve seen it.
Instead of a bra, they just put a
scarf round their neck, as if, er,
as if it were the top of a swim suit.
Super! Don't you think so?
You'll see, I’m sure in a few years
everybody will be wearing them.
No, I don't think
it's decent really.
- When is your vacation?
- At the end of the month.
- Where are you going?
- To Majorca.
Who with?
My parents can't go
with me this year.
They gave me my freedom, I can
go alone, but I’ll go with Patrick.
With Patrick?
Yes, we're going by car, after he
graduates he should be getting a car.
I'm going with my parents.
Parents are ok, but you can't
go out in the evening.
I'll have my freedom and
be out every night.
But I do go out during the day
until ten o'clock at night.
But it's after 10 that
all the fun starts.
But a boy is too much to put
up with day and night.
There's a party at Rouch's this evening.
Would you like to come?
No, I’ve to go to a friend's.
To the cinema?
No, to his house.
- Do you graduate next year?
- Yes, sure.
- Which school do you go to?
- Pontoise. You?
Moliere.
WHAT
EVERY
WOMEN
SHOULD
KNOW
SHE KNOWS IT
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
I sleep with a boy.
I don't know what to do.
He will embrace you.
He will caress you.
Switch off the light.
I shall have to undress.
He will be naked.
I will be naked.
In the darkness.
No time.
To stop thinking.
Atmosphere.
Always afraid.
He will see my breasts.
He said he had to work, so
I went to the show alone.
And just as the news
of the world started,
I saw my darling and
my best friend walk in.
Though I was sitting there,
they didn't see...
So they sat right down in front of me.
And when he kissed her
lips, I almost died.
And in the middle of the color
cartoon I began to cry.
Sad movies always
make me cry.
I know but this evening I want
to believe in my illusions and...
forget all about the details
of this sinister affair.
So I got up and slowly
walked on home.
Mama saw the tears
and said "What's wrong?"
Don't be jealous. You can have the young,
dynamic figure you envy in other women.
Wear Eloquence, the new
bra creation by Jeunesse.
Not to tell her a lie, I just said
'Sad movies make me cry.'
How far a woman
can go in love?
HOW
- The doctor is coming.
- Thanks.
- Good day, Madame.
- Good day, doctor. Well?
Your fears are
now confirmed.
The results of the laboratory
tests are positive.
You are 3 months pregnant.
You'll probably have
your baby in May.
You don't seem completely
delighted about this happy event.
Doctor, I’m worried,
frightened.
- Can you give me painless birth?
- That is just a manner of speaking.
PLEASURE AND SCIENCE
Painless birth is a method of
psychologically preparing...
the mind of the expectant mother...
for this important event,
which is often tainted by...
gruesome old-wives' tales...
in popular belief.
There's one question I’ve
always wanted to asked you.
What do you think about
methods of birth control?
Well, that's a most important
question, most important.
One which is receiving a
lot of attention at present.
It's a most obvious
fact that in an age...
when we're at the point of
sending rockets to the moon,
we still conceive, on
the surface of this earth,
as our ancestors
did in the Stone Age.
Quite often,
conception occurs
against nature...
in the worst possible
conditions.
In the case of animals
and plants,
thanks to scientific
developments,
we go about things
in a different way.
We take the
best specimens,
we plant under the most propitious
conditions to obtain the best results.
When it comes to human race,
we are doing the exact opposite.
It'll be necessary,
sooner or later,
to control and direct...
human conception.
I've a problem.
I'm hesitating between
two men,
and now that
I’m pregnant,
I don't know which
is the father.
Is physical pleasure a proof?
I really can't go along
with you there.
In fact,
in certain specific cases,
we resort to,
for instance, artificial
insemination.
In which case the patient,
experiences none of the physical
pleasure you mention,
she simply receives
an injection.
But...
pleasure and love, is
that the same thing?
Pleasure and love are phys...
two different things...
pleasure...
Is physical pleasure wrong?
Physical pleasure is not bad,
since it...
normally results in conception,
which is desirable.
I'm afraid.
DREAMS
WHAT WILL BE
TAKE SIDES!
Even a peaceful countryside,
even a meadow with flights of
crows, harvests and bonfires...
Even a road with cars, peasants
and couples going along it...
Even a holiday village with a fair and a
steeple can lead to a concentration camp.
Stuthof, Oranienburg,
Auschwitz,
Neuengamme, Belsen,
Ravensbruck, Dachau...
TAKE SIDES!
To find a solution.
Men are all the same.
Very blue eyes.
For the sake of
appearances.
Modern life.
To forget everything.
MADAME, IF YOU LOVE
YOUR HUSBAND
Why does one do what one does?
Not to make sure that one is right,
but to make sure
that one is wrong.
- How soon are you going?
- In an hour.
- Are you insured?
- Not for one hour.
An hour is long enough to have an
accident and get killed.
It's ok to die in a plane crash.
It's quick and you're not alone.
- What did you tell you'd act at Marseilles?
- A play by Racine.
Yes, it's a modern death.
- When I’m divorced, will you marry me?
- Of course I shall.
And if I’ve a child, will you
adopt it even if it isn't yours?
Yes, it'll be mine.
Why do you ask that?
We've discussed it
a hundred times.
- I think you have a funny voice.
- Who, me? Now?
No, all the time.
I have the average male
voice of the jet-age.
You don't have normal, you
have got a coward's voice!
- What's going on?
- Oh, nothing.
I'm an idiot.
Why do I love you?
I love you, you know...
- Are you getting undressed?
- Yes, aren't you?
Only my trousers. My Caravelle
leaves in half an hour.
What did you do last night?
Nothing. I watched TV.
- Brought 7000 francs for the gadget?
- Yes.
Look, here they are.
I suddenly realized it's the first
time we've been separated.
Yes, this is the
first time, I mean...
- out of Paris.
- Don't be sad.
Remember in the
Bois de Boulogne?
You said you always keep
your chin up in adversity.
Like that girl... What's she called?
You know, in the American novel.
- Scarlet O'hara?
- Yes.
I'll be terribly unhappy.
Five days without you.
What about you?
Me too, because
I love you.
But in any case,
I shall find out...
THE THEATRE AND LOVE
I've often wondered, Robert...
who you really are.
That's a funny question.
I don't really
know who I am.
I'm a fellow
like the rest.
Like others, with
faults like others...
- Tell me, you say you're an actor.
- Yes.
Why?
What's an actor?
An actor is a man who gets
on the stage, and who performs...
who attempts to
interpret a role...
to draw, to create a character,
to get outside oneself...
one's own feelings
and ideas.
Isn't that so?
And at this moment? You're taking
action in a certain situation?
Yes, at this moment...

I'm standing up for...
my job as an actor and...
my place as a man.
It's not so easy.
Not so easy.
How can you tell the difference
between life and acting?
Oh, in my opinion,
in life one isn't acting.
I don't feel at all as
though I’m acting...
Some men seem to be acting
all the time. You can tell...
But I don't think I do.
- I may be wrong.
- In theatre, do you feel you exist?
Or are you just
a vehicle?
Well, I think...
It's a difficult question to answer.
I think it's a bit of both.
It's undeniable that
one is a vehicle.
I'm a vehicle to
some extent, but then...
If it's both, it's
like this life.
- There's no difference between them?
- Oh yes, there is!
You're asking me
questions like that,
- and I’m saying what comes to my mind.
- So at this moment, it is acting?
No, not at all.
The theatre is
quite different,
There is text, the play.
One attempts...
to bring alive something
not personal to oneself,
Whereas now you ask questions
and I’m trying to reply plainly.
But it's my own text. I'm acting
a role which is my own,
which is quite different from
acting a role in the theatre.
You can't say I’m
acting because...
- When you make love, is that acting?
- Oh, no, no.
No, not at all.
Absolutely, no.
You don't like it, then.
- It's not a pleasure for you.
- Why?
- Why?
- Because you like acting.
You can like acting, and
you can like making love.
One doesn't exclude
the other.
They are absolutely two different things.
- If you had to, which would you choose?
- Making love.
Making love.
It's funny, I’m always
afraid you're acting.
No! Look, I promise you.
You know I love you, and
when I say I love you,
I’m completely sincere,
and I really mean it.
But how can I know you're sincere,
how can I know you're not acting?
But I’ve proved my love for you,
they are concrete things...
which exists between
us, and they are...
outside the question
of acting.
What does 'love'
mean to you?
- Love is what I feel for you.
- No, think before you reply.
Love is...
I promise you that...
Think what it really
means to you.
Really, love is...
that's what I feel,
my feelings for you,
everything that exists
inside me for you...
- That's love. Really love.
- Don't talk about me. Talk about you.
But how can I?
Talking about love is talking about
the relations between two people.
Love is... oneself in
relation to another.
It's oneself in relation to...
er... I don't know...
If I asked your good qualities,
what would you say?
Qualities? Why
not my faults?
- It's your good qualities I’m interested in.
- Intelligence.
- Distrustfulness.
- Is distrustfulness a quality?
- Yes.
- Is that all?
Sincerity...
What about loving me?
That, too.
What would you
say yours are?
Never to think twice
about anything.
You know, Pierre rang
me from Düsseldorf,
He's coming this evening.
Will you sleep with him?
I don't know, if he asks me,
perhaps...
What do you mean "perhaps"?
Could you kiss two girls at
the same time, caress them?
I'd have to choose, too.
Spare me, Madame, unfortunate
prince that I am,
And let us not give in
to tears. Give me my cues.
Too late I tried to flee,
These cruel meetings that
weren't meant for me.
It was my wish to bear
you one last time,
- No more I bear, now I bid you goodbye.
- So how can I put it finally?
I flee from the eyes turned to
my direction but never see me.
Goodbye...
Go, my mind is too
full of your image,
To wait for death
while loving you...
Above all,
do not fear.
Don't fear, that I’ll be so blinded by grief,
that I’ll fill the world with the reason for it.
Madame...
The only thing to remind
you I was alive,
Will be the report of my death,
which I hope comes soon.
For ever, oh my lord,
think deep in yourself,
How terrible this cruel
world is, when one loves,
How can we bear...
for a year, for a day, my lord, the
thousand seas that keeps you away,
When the day begins,
and the day ends,
Will Titus be far from
the sight of Berenice?
Are you crying?
No, I’m not.
What makes you
say that?
You've got tears
in your eyes.
Yes, I’m crying.
Over now? I must go.
Yes...
Yes, it's over.
