Honey?
Hi.
Are these for me?
Uh-huh.
Pretty!
You hungry?
Yeah.
I fixed your favorite.
Mmm!
Would you open
the wine?
Sure.
It's a great year.
Sorry I'm late.
Where were you?
I was worried.
Some hotshot tracker
brought in an order ...
of spark plugs
and percussion caps, ...
99% of which
were all bonged up, ...
rusted pure orange -
rusted like carrots.
Bon appetit.
Looks great!
So do you.
Thanks.
You're welcome, Sam.
Do you know that rust ...
is an electrochemical
process?
Electrochemical?
Yeah.
I just learned this.
I learned something
today, too.
What do these things
have in common -
Lightning rods,
fig newtons, ...
escalators, ballpoint
pens, and vaseline?
Vaseline?
Mm-hmm.
I don't know.
I give up.
They were all invented
by Americans.
Who invented vaseline?
Dessert?
Yeah.
Cherry?
What's wrong, honey?
Are you ok?
Kiss me.
Cherry?
Well, she sure took
a lot of water.
Can you fix her?
I'm sorry, kid.
Total internal meltdown.
They don't come
any finer than this.
Level of response,
sensitivity ...
It's a thing of the past.
I'm sorry.
What about her chip?
I wouldn't let you go
without that.
You got her basic memory
right here -
Her vocal patterns,
reflex action, personality.
They don't make them
like this anymore.
You do know how rare
and valuable this is?
Yeah.
I know.
I know how it is.
You're like me.
You're a romantic.
Most of these birds,
they don't care.
It's all
apple pandowdy to them.
But we both know ...
each one of these honeys
is special -
Got her own special magic,
her own special way.
Isn't that true?
Let me show you something.
Come here.
Got to face it, Sam.
This is 2017.
Even the best tracker
couldn't find a Cherry ...
in these parts.
What am I gonna do, slim?
It's a Cherry
or nothing.
Let me show you
a couple things.
Now, this is
our Bambi 14 model.
Brand-new,
never been used.
Coming up
is our Cindy 990.
Strictly domestic,
actually -
Housework, taxes,
things like that.
Below the waist,
no man's land.
Now, if I read
you correctly, ...
I think
you're looking ...
for something with
a little more spunk.
Spunk isn't exactly
the word.
It's more kind of ...
intangible.
Mm-hmm. Step down
for a minute ...
and gaze upon perfection,
craftsmanship.
Disk drive,
pelvic roll -
This is when
detroit still cared.
Sam? Sam.
Oh, Sam.
Give me a little time.
I'll check around.
That's all I can do.
With unemployment
down to 40%,
The nation
rounds the corner.
Salvage and recycling centers
are paving the way ...
for the future.
Just as our grandfathers'
generation did, ...
workers today
need to think twice ...
before
throwing things away.
Toaster ovens, steam irons,
blow-driers -
Whole families
are pitching in.
The result
is plain to see -
A new life
for household appliances.
Sectors 19 and 3 ...
are still experiencing
periodic shortages.
Please check your area ...
for any serviceable
manufactured appliance.
The Red Zone
is for magnesium ...
and silocarbide recyclables
only.
Please have
your reclamation credit form ...
ready for processing.
Sambo!
Hey, Bill.
Sam.
5:00, Champ.
Closing time.
We're heading for
the Glu Glu Club.
Want to tag along?
No, thanks.
Drinks are
on bill.
Hey, wait a minute.
You pale
or something?
I hate
the Glu Glu Club.
We can go
somewhere else.
The Wink Wink.
The Dotted Line!
They're all the same.
Bill's got a hot date
with Amy Meemur.
Amy who?
Bitch on wheels.
Been tryin' to land that
fish for five weeks.
Come on, guys, ...
you know
I'll be dead weight.
Stand by. Stand firm.
Strength in numbers.
Aw, you guys go on.
I got to
straighten out ...
this extension-cord situation
in sector 5.
Sector 5?
That's a lost cause.
Pack it in.
Have a drink.
Workin' too hard.
Have two drinks.
So your robot
is gone.
Why don't you try
some real women?
Take 5. Take 10. Get
away from the plant.
Ok.
Let's do it.
This is it, Sam -
flesh and blood.
All you got to do
is a little paperwork, ...
some song and dance,
and then you're home free.
Women, Sam.
Real women.
Amy Meemur.
Looks hot.
Let's get it down
on paper.
You stick
your tongue ...
in my client's
mouth, ...
and I'll sue your
ass off!
Dealbreaker.
Hi.
This is
me and Steve ...
I think that's Steve.
Yeah.
Ha ha ha!
I met him here
last month.
You're
really something.
Don't you have
something to show me?
Actually, no.
What?
Well,
my card's expired.
I'm sorry.
What in the hell's
the matter with you?
I mean what are you doing
if your card's expired?
I'm sorry.
Of all the stupidest
god damn things!
Asshole!
Ok.
Let's see.
We're talking about ...
a standard one-night
arrangement, right?
I guess. Yeah.
So we'll say a dinner,
complete sexual encounter, ...
full penetration,
optional episode in the morning.
Just slow down.
I personally thought
it would be nice.
Let me see this.
My lawyer better
see this one.
For instance, the oral
clause seems a little ...
Sticky.
Minor point.
We'll work it out in bed.
Hey,you work
it out in bed ...
cause I'm not
gonna be there!
No deal, no peel.
Hi, honey.
Are these for me?
Ohh, pretty!
You hungry?
I fixed your favorite.
I learned something
today, too.
What do these things
have in common -
Lightning rods,
fig newtons, ...
escalators, ball point
pens, and vaseline?
Dessert?
I'm sorry, kid.
Total internal meltdown.
Bingo, Sam! I heard
of a tracker ...
who'll go
into Zone 7.
He'll get you
a Cherry - same make.
Right down to the model
number and eyelashes.
Stick in
her memory chip, ...
and you got your girl
back exactly like before.
Now, there's
a tracker bar ...
out at Glory Hole.
Drive out there, find
a tracker named Johnson.
Good luck, Sam.
You'll need it.
I'd like a room
for tonight.
The name is Treadwell.
That'll be a buck-50
for the night.
We run clean place.
We like things
quiet.
The rule is ...
you can't bring
robots in after 11:00.
We got
big selection ...
of Freds and Johns
and Marilyns, ...
so don't have to
drag no one in here.
Have you got
any Cherrys?
Cherrys?
Where you come from?
Hmm!
Jeez!
Not again!
Ohh ...
Damn thing's busted.
What ever happened
to pride in workmanship?
Hello?
Hello?
Anybody here?
Anybody here?
It better be good.
I just want to talk to
E. Johnson about a job.
Who are you?
Sam Treadwell -
from Anaheim.
I'm E. Johnson.
Excuse me.
I think
I made a mistake.
What the -
I grew up
in the Zone, mister.
I've been a guide in the
territory since I was a kid.
I can distinguish ...
between poisonous
and nonpoisonous reptiles.
And I know the roads.
I used to ride
with Six Fingered Jake ...
when he had all his digits.
He was the best tracker
in the business.
Maybe I was a bit rash.
Now, what is it
you want?
Not so fast.
She's a Cherry 2000.
I want you
to go into Zone 7 ...
and get me one
just like her.
This isn't
a dating service.
I thought
you never say no.
I haven't ... yet.
I'm paying 500
for the job, ...
200 up front.
200 up front.
It's been sort of
a dull week.
I hope you don't mind
traveling at night.
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?
We'd have more fun
chewing on razor blades ...
than dribbling around the
Zone in broad daylight.
What do you mean we?
I'm not going anywhere.
I hired you to go in.
That's the deal.
You bring her back,
you get paid.
Those robot chassis are
kept in the worst part ...
of the Zone.
We call it
the graveyard.
Maybe I can get in
and find this thing, ...
but I need somebody
riding shotgun ...
in order to make it
out in one piece.
Forget it.
I think I'll find this
guy Six Fingered Jake.
Who are you?
My name is Treadwell,
Sam Treadwell, ...
I'm looking
for a tracker.
A guy named
Six Fingered Jake.
Where can I find him?
I've got a job for him.
Jake's dead.
Lester caught him
out in Zone 7 ...
and cut off
his hands.
And then
he bled to death.
Where you from,
mister?
Anaheim.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Rum. 151.
Uh-huh.
And a cruller.
2 Bits, Anaheim.
Maybe I can
help you out, mister.
You a tracker?
I do odd jobs.
Name's Stacy
This is Earl.
He's visiting
from Adobe Flats.
Sit down.
Have a drink
and a doughnut.
What did you want
to see Jake for?
Oh, don't worry
about Earl.
He's deaf
as a doorknob.
I'm looking for someone
to go into Zone 7.
Zone 7.
That's right.
What is it
you want in there?
My, my!
Is that a Cherry?
A Cherry 2000.
Va-voom!
Know where you can
find one like her?
That all depends on how
much you're willing to spend.
Just the chassis.
You got the money
on you now?
Maybe I do.
Maybe I don't.
Ok.
Earl.
You stay here.
Me and Mr. Treadwell
are going to talk to Jake.
Six Fingered Jake?
Jake's alive.
He just don't like
publicity.
Yeah, Zone 7
is a tough place.
You should see the way
they carry on out there -
People staying up all night
playing twister, ...
reverting to
their animal natures.
So where are we going?
I'm taking you
to see Jake.
Well, where is he?
He's dead. Ha ha!
Drop the gun.
I didn't mean you,
weevil brain!
Now pick that up!
God, you make me sick!
And the cartridges, too,
while you're at it.
I thought he couldn't
hear too well.
I read lips.
Got the money
on you, Sam?
What about the chip?
Lester's going to
want that chip.
Shut up, Earl!
Search him.
Jesus!
Get off! Get off me!
You dumb, fat -
Earl, you chicken head!
Hey, Johnson, ...
I've been
thinking it over.
You got the job.
That's what I figured.
Get in.
Ok, let's just get ...
a few things straight,
Treadwell.
I do the tracking.
You just sit there
and don't touch anything.
Fine. Let's just
get out of here.
How can you see?
I mean how can you
see to drive?
I drive by feel,
mostly.
By feel.
Mostly.
What the hell are you doing?
What's wrong?
Why did we stop?
Put this on.
Don't you wear one?
It might mess up
my hair.
Are you lost?
I think we're -
Mister, I'd appreciate it
if you'd just shut up ...
until we get through
the barricades.
What barricades?
Keep your head low,
and try not to get shot.
Oh, great.
Hang on.
Friends of yours?
A bunch of freaks
out on the edges.
They got nothing
to do. They're bored.
They just want
a little action.
It's real mature.
Have a nice nap?
Where are we?
Ok. We're about
right here.
And the robot graveyard
is over here.
I figure eight hours
of driving will get us ...
into the yard about
4:00 in the morning.
Gives you
about 15 minutes ...
to find your doll.
15 Minutes?
At the most.
There'll be sirens screaming,
patrols everywhere, ...
dogs, you name it.
The whole shootin' match.
The trick is
to time it just right ...
so we can make it out
while it's still dark.
You make it
sound so easy.
You stand watch.
I'm gonna get some rest.
Wait a minute.
You expect me
to sit around here ...
when we're so close?
Why don't you let me drive
while you sleep?
No way, mister.
Nobody drives
my car.
Go hum a little tune
or something.
Count your lucky stars,
read a book.
I don't care.
Just don't
go walking around.
Yeah, I'll hum
a little tune.
I don't believe her.
"Nobody drives my car."
I love you, Sam.
I'm so lucky
to be with you.
Kiss me.
Oh, that's nice.
What do you
want me to do?
Ok. Move closer.
Mmm ... yes.
That feels good.
Yes.
Yes, here. Faster.
Faster. Oh ...
Is that your hand?
Let me
help you with that.
Oh, I like that.
Yes, here.
Faster, faster, yes.
Aah!
Whoa!
Whoa!
I thought I told you
to stay put.
Next time
you wander off like that, ...
I'll leave you behind
for the buzzards.
Is that a threat
or a promise?
It's Lester.
Who's Lester?
He's sort of
judge, jury, ...
and executioner
out here, ...
a total wacko.
He and his gang
control Zone 7.
What's
he doing here?
Good question.
Aah!
Come on.
We're going to take
a little detour.
Good idea.
It's just
one more day.
Don't look
so brokenhearted.
Her eyes
are red dots.
That's
from the flash.
That's where
the red comes from.
If I took a picture
of you, ...
the same thing
would happen.
Why would you want to
take a picture of me?
I said "if".
If.
Oh.
If only
I had red eyes.
Are we lost?
Relax. Been this way
100 times before.
What is that?
It's a crane.
I can see that.
I mean what's it
doing out here?
Nothing ...
Yet.
Well, we're
wasting time.
Let's get going.
Hold your horses.
You're paying me
to do a job, ...
not drive a bus.
So leave
the tracking to me.
Fine.
I'll get some sleep.
I wouldn't get
too comfortable.
More barricades?
This ain't nothing
like the barricades.
Les, we've got
a situation here.
An unidentified white male
and that redheaded tracker ...
just blasted their way
into the Zone.
They're unauthorized, Brad.
Waste them!
I can't wait
any longer.
Randa, I do like
your personality.
Hope you're not
afraid of heights.
Magnet attached.
I don't believe this.
It's the best way
to cross the river.
Don't tell me.
You've been this way
a hundred times before.
Target in position.
Get ready!
You know how
to use it?
We'll go on 3.
1, 2, 3.
Buck, dump them
in the river!
10-4.
Give me a rope!
You got it!
It's time to
take out the operator.
Right.
God! Uh, I'm hit!
Be careful!
Keep me covered.
Put on your seat belt.
Things are going
to get a bit rough.
Wish me luck.
You're crazy!
Whoa!
Ooh!
You all right?
You all right?
Uh ... swallowed my gum.
Hurry up!
Give me your hand!
You always
work this way?
Yeah, but it's
never been this easy.
Never say no,
huh?
I hope you know
what you're doing!
Ok, Treadwell
End of the line.
Great.
What's next?
We got to hoof it
from here.
Hey, wait!
Gotta
get my stuff!
I can't see the bottom.
Don't worry.
It's down there.
Ah!
Aah! Look out!
Watch it!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Aah!
Good move
up there.
Hope you can swim.
It's a little late
to be asking that.
He with you?
Client.
You all right?
Yeah. Just taking
a little dip.
Ha ha!
It's good to see you.
Yeah.
I almost
shot your friend there.
This is Sam Treadwell
from Anaheim.
Oh ...
Good to see you.
Hi, honey.
Did you have a nice day?
Oh, pretty!
What are the women like
in big towns?
You have any idea?
You mean
like Anaheim?
Yeah, like Anaheim.
Well, it's all
sort of paranoid ...
and audio-visual.
Nobody has it easy.
People meet in bars ...
and use everything
they got, ...
all kinds
of legal mumbo jumbo, ...
demo reels,
under-the-counter drugs.
It's just bad,
that's all.
Well, no way
I'd put up with that.
Well, shoot, E.
How are these fellas
going to find out ...
about
your 101 charms?
Well, anyone
with any brains ...
would just
figure it out.
Where did you find
Mr. Handsome?
It's a job.
I liked you better
in them other duds.
This is how
I usually dress.
Where did you get
all those boxes back there, ...
those toaster ovens?
I found them with some
rubbish out this side of reno.
They all work?
What would I be doing with them
if they didn't work?
Toast's just the beginning
with your new toaster oven.
You can make
open-face sandwiches, ...
baked potatoes, ...
and best of all, ...
the tray is removable
for easy cleaning.
Look at this.
Ha ha ha!
There ain't nothing like it
for cooking rattler.
Mmm.
You're Six Fingered
Jake, aren't you?
He is, isn't he?
Well, what if I am?
Nothing.
I just heard
a lot about you.
Like what?
I heard you were dead.
Retired's more like it.
I've been trying
to create a serene outlook.
You gonna tell me what you
and Speed are doing out here?
We're just going
into the yard ...
to get one of those
sex robots for Sam.
His old one broke down
from overexertion, ...
it sounds like.
It wasn't like that.
Oh, it wasn't?
"Are you all right?"
"Here,
lay your head here."
"Ah! Is that
your hand?"
We talked.
I could talk to her.
Yeah, right.
"Faster, faster."
You could
never understand ...
with that neanderthal
brain of yours.
At least
I have a brain.
There was tenderness, ...
a dreamlike quality
about her.
There was romance.
Romance?
Yeah, romance!
With a robot!
I mean we are talking
about a robot, aren't we?
She isn't
just a robot.
Maybe I know
what you mean, Speed.
You're a dreamer.
You got something
you believe in, ...
and that's
a rare thing these days, ...
but there's a lot more
to love than hot-wiring.
Good morning.
He catch anything?
A couple of carp.
So, we moving in here
or what?
Got to wait till dark
to flush out my Ford.
I'd rather be chewing
on razor blades ...
than piddle around the Zone
in broad daylight.
Treadwell,
you in position?
Hold on to your horses.
I love you.
We're going down the tube
in two minutes.
Be careful up there.
Ooh!
Treadwell!
You all right?
Treadwell!
Elaine?
Is that you?
Hi, Sam.
I changed my name.
I changed it to Ginger.
You look great.
It's good
to see you again.
Do you think you could
help me with this?
What are you
doing here?
I live here.
Thanks.
This is Zone 7,
right?
You guys, this is
my old boyfriend, Sam.
Now, scoot, huh?
We got some catching up
to do, right, Sam?
Vamoose!
Come on, boy.
Sit by the pool.
Tell me what
you've been doing.
Listen ...
I was with someone,
and we got shanghaied.
The next thing I know,
I ... I wake up here.
Was anyone
found with me?
I don't know
anything about it.
Les said you were
the only one left alive.
Oh, Sam, I just
love it out here.
The city was
just so much bull.
I'm a whole
different person now.
I feel so secure.
I feel ... focused, ...
like I never
felt before.
Elaine, I told you
I was with someone!
I said
I changed my name!
Can't you respect that?
Can't you listen
when I talk to you?
You haven't changed
a bit, Sam.
I mean, we can't have
any negative energy ...
around this place.
I mean, shit, Les isn't
going to put up with it.
Lester ...
That's him now.
Try not to get
in the way, Sam.
I've got to go change.
Don't be so negative.
Lester's very sensitive.
Yeeha!
Yoo!
A lot of bullets,
a lot of guns.
Yeah, but
we handled it.
Sam!
Ow!
This is Lester.
How's it going, Sam?
Good to see you
on your feet.
Donny!
You heard the man.
Get up!
This here's
Jim Sneak.
The boys found him asleep
in that broken down cart.
Case of sunstroke.
Skeet.
The name's Skeet.
Said he was headed
for Elko, ...
but he got lost.
I still am lost.
Let's go!
See you later.
Well, supper's
almost ready.
Gentlemen!
Don't goof up.
One grenade
will get you off.
Keep a close eye
on these prisoners, Soldier.
Nature is
the great provider.
I do like fresh pods!
Chris.
Thank you,
Lester.
Sam.
Do you work out?
No.
Well,
you should.
You got the frame
for it-trim.
Got to watch
what you eat, though.
Diet's important.
Man's got to watch
what he eats.
We got a program -
diet, exercise, ...
mental discipline.
I like to see people ...
reach their
full potential.
Recognize her?
Mm-mm.
That's a Cherry 2000.
I got a passel of them
in the yard, ...
but I can't seem to
find the right chip ...
to make them work,
get them to go.
You get one of
these fired up, ...
it's like slamming
an octopus.
Ha ha ha!
How you doing
down there, Sneak?
That bird
too cooked for you?
No, I just don't
like to eat heavy ...
before
a big tournament.
What are you doing
in these parts anyway?
I was
on my way to Elko.
Gonna play
in the Elko Classic.
I've been meaning to ask you
something else, too, Sneak.
How's it my boys
found these firearms ...
smoking in your bags
when they picked you up?
I ... I
just carry that ...
for protection,
you know.
Protection.
What about all those dry cell
batteries under the seat?
What about all those dry cell
batteries under the seat?
Ahh ... you're a tracker,
aren't you, Jimbo?
Now, now, now,
wait a minute.
Now, we got a policy
against trackers in these parts, ...
and I could never tolerate
lying in any form.
Chet.
Ahh!
Ah, ah, ah!
Slip that
on your head.
What?
Put that on your face.
Thanks.
Don't tear that.
John,
help him out.
Now what?
What's going on?
What are you doing
with my hands?
Come on, Lester.
Right in the head.
Help!
Come on,
get him, Les!
Get him now!
All right!
What are you guys doing?
Ah, hell!
I've got too much club
for this dude.
Ooh!
All right,
Lester!
Make it
a hole in one!
Let me out of here!
Fore!
< You do the hokey-pokey
and you turn yourself around >
< That's what
it's all about, hey! >
< You put your
right arm in >
< You take your
right arm out >
< You put your
right foot in >
< And you shake
it all about >
< Hmm hmm hmm
hmm hmm hmm >
< Hmm hmm hmm
hmm hmm hmm hmm >
< That's what
it's all about >
Sam.
Come here.
Les really
likes you, Sam.
It's great you have
this rapport with him.
Right off the bat.
The man is a
psychopathic killer.
Don't impose your
values on me, Sam.
A lot of the people, ...
I'll admit it -
they're flakes.
But that's why we need
somebody like you, Sam.
Someone to pull
in the slack.
You're not
listening to me, Sam.
No. No, no.
I'm listening.
Ginger.
I am.
But I can't
stay here.
There's three kinds
of barbed wire ...
fencing us in here.
There's mines
further out, ...
no real water
to speak of.
I think you should
stick around.
Give this place
a chance.
Les is going to
bring you in ...
on a training session
in the morning.
Oh, great.
So I think you'd
better get some sleep.
Ok.
Good night, Sam.
Uhh!
Nice night.
Is that right?
Yeah. Just, uh ...
Taking a walk.
You know,
admiring the stars.
There's orion.
Right there. See?
Uhh!
What the -
Did you miss me?
Come on.
What happened
to you?
I tracked you here
on a mule.
It took a while.
Is Jake dead?
Not yet.
What happened
to the other burro?
They shot him
in the heart.
Sorry about
your gear.
What are you doing?
Let's just
get out of here.
You got about
60 seconds.
Ha ha ha!
Edith,
where'd you get ...
that little
go-to-hell hat?
Found it.
Yeah. Well, I'm going
to circle round back.
I'll meet you
at Snappy Tom's.
I don't want
you to be lonely, ...
so you take this.
And, uh,
you let me know ...
how things
turn out, will you?
You ease up there,
Uncle John.
Go! Go! Go!
About time.
This way!
Over here!
Red alert!
Aah!
Les, watch out
for the bees!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Well ...
You've won
your spurs.
Ha. Yeah.
I told him
to stay, Les.
I explained
everything, ...
and I encouraged
him to stay.
Ginger, ...
have the girls
fix some sandwiches.
Yecch!
Why are you
looking so glum?
I lost Cherry's chip
back on that mule.
Kind of wipes out the
whole deal, doesn't it?
We could still break into
the yard and get Cherry, ...
but that would be like
a toaster or something.
Her personality's
on that chip.
You can't separate
personality ...
from the rest of it.
At least I can't.
Well, we can turn
around and go back ...
after we meet up
with Jake.
You'll get
a full refund.
I don't care
about the money.
I never cared
about that.
Nelson! Dix!
Yes, Sir!
Chase those birds
till they drop.
Don't kill them.
Hold them
till I get there.
We'll get these vehicles
fixed as soon as we can.
We're counting on you men.
Keep the sun
out of your eyes, ...
and be yourselves.
Move out.
Whoa!
Are you ok?
Oh, yeah.
I just
bumped my head.
I wasn't watching.
Where are we,
anyway?
Are you sure
you're ok?
No.
I mean, yeah.
I just feel really
groggy and hot.
Ohh.
Ohh.
Ohh!
Hi, honey.
Ha ha!
Are these for me?
Oh, pretty!
You hungry?
I fixed your favorite.
Where were you?
I was getting worried.
I learned something
today, too.
Why didn't
you tell me?
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
You lied to me.
You can say a lot of
things about Cherry, ...
but she never lied.
Yeah? Well, I'm not
a fucking machine.
Great.
Lester's guys.
Ooh!
I feel better now.
Aah!
Get in the car.
Where are we going?
To the robot graveyard.
Where'd you think?
I mean that's what you
hired me for, isn't it?
That's right.
That's what
you really want.
Yeah!
You're damn right!
Want one
of these now?
Hurry up, Randa.
Check out the hut.
Drop it.
Turn around.
You drop it, sugar.
You drop it,
Red.
Drop your gun,
Snappy.
Well, Jake.
Dogs and cats.
I heard
you was dead.
Not yet.
I'm sorry I didn't
recognize you, E.
Randa, honey,
you know Jake.
Hi, Randa.
This here's
E. Johnson.
And I don't know who
this young man is.
Sam Treadwell
from Anaheim.
How you getting
on out here, Randa?
I miss the beach.
Randa is going to fix
us lunch, ain't you, Randa?
No.
Well, then, you can
just go shit in your hat.
I wish you wouldn't say
them dirty words, Snappy.
Forget it, Johnson.
Don't think about it.
There's no way.
It's easy.
We fly over the mines, ...
we drop into the yard.
In and out.
Forget it.
Just fix the car.
I flew one of these
in the border wars.
This one's
shot to hell.
Do you think
you could manage ...
to take the plugs
out of my Ford?
What are you
trying to prove?
I'm just
doing my job.
You can't fix this!
You need
a whole new engine.
Look at yourself.
You're a mess.
Well, we can't all
be glamour pussies ...
24 Hours a day.
Ah!
Randa?
Randa, honey,
this is Les.
Lester?
Snappy tom here, Lester.
Everything's just fine.
Snappy, I'm looking
for a shabby individual ...
who burned down sky ranch.
He escaped in an orange
custom Ford.
He ain't alone.
If they show up,
hold them till I get there.
I want them alive.
Hi, Lester?
They're here.
Three of them
plus a donkey.
They're fixing
that old air -
Blow this off!
We got new
coordinates!
This is so stupid!
It'll never run.
No way.
You afraid
of dying, Speed?
Can't say I think about it
much these days.
Well, the way
I got it figured, ...
when your time comes -
My time, your time -
It's like you turn into
a little part of the world.
Wind, maybe.
Yeah.
A little
stream of wind.
Maybe so.
Well ...
Sometimes I feel like
I know the whole story.
And then other times I ...
feel like it's completely
out of control.
They've got that
damn plane working.
Go get the macaroni
and cheese, Randa.
Lunch!
Tell E.
to come to lunch.
Right.
Great!
You fixed the plane!
Yeah, well,
forget it.
Lester and the guys
from the motel ...
are making
a beeline for us.
Go tell Jake
we're leaving.
Jake! Jake those guys
from the motel ...
are almost here.
We gotta clear out!
You and Edith
go on ahead.
Ah! Ohh!
Hold it!
Get those
legs moving.
Let's hurry up!
Uhh!
Mount up!
Jake's dead.
What?
That girl shot him
in the back.
He's dead.
Ohh!
Get rid of that.
I don't, uh ...
I don't like
what I feel.
I, uh,
I feel anger.
I'm-I'm experiencing
anger, Snappy.
Well, I'm sorry to
hear that, Lester.
Well, you told me
the plane couldn't fly.
Well, that was
my understanding.
Frankly, I don't
know how she did it.
But I got one of them.
One's dead right there.
Yeah, I told you
I wanted them alive.
Well, sometimes
things don't always ...
turn out like we want.
You know, I thought I saw
something in you, Snappy.
I thought
I saw potential.
Lester, I've been
waiting for you.
I'm busy, Randa.
Look at my sandals.
Tell her
to go back inside.
Randa,
go inside, Randa.
Wait, listen, Lester.
You know the guys
on the plane?
They're going
into the yard.
I overheard them.
If we hurry,
we can catch them.
Oh, my god.
What happened
to your face?
You need to work
on your personality.
Sorry, Snappy.
Move out!
Come on,
let's go.
E.,
let's turn around ...
and call
the whole thing off.
It's too late.
No, it's not.
I got to believe
I've been doing a job.
You take that away
and then what?
What did Jake
get shot up for?
You sure we'll
find a Cherry?
Follow me.
Where are
the patrols?
And dogs. You said
there'd be dogs.
How should I know?
Unload!
Let's move back there!
Hurry up!
Remember,
gentlemen, ...
life is
an adventure.
Hyah!
Yeehah!
This is it.
Make it quick.
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Yeah!
Me and the boys will
take this on foot.
Wait in the jeep.
I'll be right back.
What about
these sandwiches?
It's not good to go out
in this heat ...
on an empty stomach.
Ringo, Squid.
Keys.
Listen,
I want them alive.
Check the robot room first.
Be friendly, yet firm.
Don't break anything,
especially you.
Now move out.
All right.
Ringo.
How about we check
that skylight?
Ok.
This one?
Close,
but not quite.
Hey!
Get on down there.
Now!
Do I have to
tell you to hurry?
Hi, honey.
I told you to hurry.
Where are we going?
We're going home.
Cherry, let's go!
Pretty!
They're up there!
Come on, Cherry!
Wheee!
Who are those guys?
Just come on!
Hurry!
Get down!
Honey, I'd really rather be
watching this on television.
Keep down!
You ready?
On 3.
1, 2 ...
3.
Uhh! Uhh! Ohh!
Oh!
Aah!
Let's get
out of here.
Come on, E.!
Ohh!
Come on.
Lester!
Come on.
Uhh!
Uhh!
Start her up!
Uhh!
Come on, baby.
We're too heavy.
There! The plane!
Don't let them get away!
Slow down when you
pass the garbage, ...
and I'll jump out.
What?
You go on.
My job's done.
Forget it!
Just hold on.
I've almost got it!
We made it!
The tracker!
There she is!
Squid! Janey!
The junk pile!
I love you.
I love you.
Aah!
Aah!
Shoot.
Cherry, I want you
to get me a Pepsi.
Sure.
A Pepsi?
Come on, E.!
Come on!
Get those
legs moving!
Let's
hurry it up!
Ohh!
What about her?
She was
the whole point.
She's a robot.
Uhh!
Aah!
Ginger, what are
we going to do now?
You guys want
some sandwiches?
Lester's dead.
Well, no sandwich
for him.
Pretty.
