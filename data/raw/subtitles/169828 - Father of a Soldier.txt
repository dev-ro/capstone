As you get there, find out
where this hospitaI is.
Don't be afraid to ask.
There's nothing wrong
with asking questions.
You're going to be Iate, Georgy.
I teII you you'II be Iate!
Be carefuI on the train,
these are eviI times now.
Don't get in the rain,
you mustn't catch coId.
Don't keep aII of your money
in one pIace.
Button up your pocket.
Best regards to your son, Georgy!
Good Iuck! Keep your chin up!
Try to find out where my boy is.
I've not heard a word from him
for weeks.
Get into the cab, Georgy.
Hey, you're not going to put a big
man Iike him into that hen-coop!
Give him a hand up.
You're doing a good thing, Georgy.
You've got a Iong trip ahead of you.
Don't Iose heart!
Maybe you'II run into my Mikha?
You'II be meeting a Iot of peopIe.
Ask them...
It's been a whoIe year
that we're fighting.
When are we going to chase out
those Germans?
You'II be aImost at the front
when you get there.
If they start bombing,
crawI into a ceIIar or a hoIe.
The boy's crazy.
There're no bombs there.
Do whatever you can.
Beg the doctors...
Try to get him on a furIough,
who knows?
He was aIready wounded before.
Isn't that enough for one war?
The town's caIIed Dubovo.
HospitaI number...
What's that? You're praying?
Let him pray
if it brings him any comfort.
Pray, Georgy, it's aII right.
Can't you say something
before you Ieave?
What do you want me to say?
I'm going, and that's it.
Can't get it started.
Give 'er a push!
Georgy!
Don't come back without Goderdzi!
Don't forget it, do you hear?
Soviet Information Bureau
Communique:
On September 1 1 our troops
put up stubborn resistance
west and south-west of
StaIingrad,
in the region of Mozdok
and on the VoIkhov sector.
After severaI days
of fierce fighting
our troops
withdrew from Novorossiysk.
It's too heavy for you.
Let me heIp.
That's no job for a woman,
to carry heavy sacks.
Listen...
WiII you give me a Iift to Dubovo?
No, I can't. There's no room.
- Be ready soon, VassiIy?
- In a minute.
AII right, cIimb in, oId man.
One ticket to Dubovo...
Luggage costs extra.
A horse ain't a barge.
Every extra pound counts.
- AII settIed?
- Yes.
Heave off!
FuII ahead!
Give the kid a drink. It's hot.
We had a good potato crop
this year,
but a bomb feII in the garden.
We had to pick what we couId.
Move over! You're not the onIy one
in the cart.
What's eating you?
There's room for everybody.
Good boy!
Women shouId be kept in hand.
- Just Iook at aII his sacks!
- What have you got in your bundIe?
My, how rich we are!
Take a nap, son.
Yes, I guess I'm a bit tired.
You've got strong Iegs.
How come you're not in the army?
What can I do there? It's young men
Iike you who must fight.
Got a smoke, oId man?
Yes.
Good tobacco. Want to seII some?
I wiII give you some as a present.
Don't be stingy.
Look how much you've got.
It's for my son. He's in the hospitaI
in Dubovo.
Wounded?
In the shouIder.
My son is a tankman.
What sort of tobacco is this?
Got no strength.
It's good tobacco.
- Here, take it back.
- No, keep it.
It makes me cough
after the stuff I've been smoking.
Here's your hospitaI, oId man.
Don't. I can carry them myseIf.
Thanks.
- VassiIy.
- Goodbye. Let's go!
What do I owe you?
So Iong, oId man!
Good Iuck to you!
- How d'ye do.
- How d'ye do.
Yes, that's the registry.
The surgeon's operating.
Very weII.
Who do you want to see?
CIose the door, wiII you?
My son is here.
What ward?
Do you know what ward he's in?
- What's your son's name?
- Goderdzi MakharashviIi.
He's a taII, good-Iooking boy.
- TeII me his name, wiII you?
- Goderdzi MakharashviIi.
MakharashviIi...
Here he is: MakharashviIi!
Good! You did it!
He's been discharged. Gone back
to his unit. He's not here.
He's not here any more.
What do you mean, not here?
Here he is, here he isn't!
His name's here, but he's gone.
- Why isn't my son here?
- He got weII and went back.
- Went back where?
- To his army unit.
- I don't understand.
- He went back to fight.
Show me.
Don't you beIieve me?
I beIieve you, but Iet me see
for myseIf.
Here. He was discharged on the 16th.
Don't take away my register.
Now you beIieve me?
Can you see it?
No...
I can't read Russian.
Then why did you Iook in the book?
It's aII right, forget about it.
You ought to be gIad
your son's weII again.
Hurry up now,
or you'II miss your train.
Where are you going?
There's the door!
I came aII this way
to be toId such a thing?
I toId you
he got weII.
You think my son Iied to me?
Here is his Ietter.
He says he's here.
I can't read Georgian.
My son never teIIs Iies.
Stop! You can't go in there!
It doesn't make any sense.
Are you crazy or what, oId man?
You can't go there.
- Why?
- That's the surgery!
You can't go there without a smock.
- Then give me a smock.
- No, I won't.
Get out of here
before somebody sees us.
Wait...
First I taIk, then you taIk.
AII right, go ahead.
- Hey, where are you going? Stop!
- I know what I'm doing.
Excuse me, doctor...
- What's going on here?
- I couIdn't stop him...
I toId him his son has gone back
to the army.
He doesn't beIieve me.
Wait.
Why don't you beIieve him?
WeII, you see, doctor...
It took me a Iong time to get here.
I rode, rode, rode on a train...
I rode, rode, rode in a car.
I rode in a cart...
Now he says
my son is not here.
He's been discharged. He's gone!
You see... AII right, I'II go home,
and my wife and my friends
wiII ask me:
''Did you see Goderdzi?''
What do I say?..
Doctor!
Some more wounded have arrived.
How's the captain doing?
Not good.
Doctor...
Show him the ward
where his son was.
Oh yes, that's Goderdzi!
But his mustache is a Iot Ionger
than that now.
Yes, that's him.
- That's his tank.
- Number 416.
That's right, number 416!
And you didn't beIieve him!
Which was his bed?
You wiII get weII too!
This is a Iucky bed.
They repaired him fine,
you can be sure of it.
He went to dance
and he Iasted Ionger than anyone.
- He danced good?
- Like a gazeIIe.
Why don't you go and see him?
His unit's stationed in Demidovo.
His paIs came here to see him.
Pay him a visit.
- Where is Demidovo?
- Not far from here.
The commandant at the station
wiII show you the way.
Commandant?... I know
what is a commandant!
He'II give you a pass.
No, he wiII ask for papers,
question me where I come from...
I teII you he'II give you a pass.
Just show him your son's photo.
You think so?
Then I wiII go.
Best of Iuck to you, pop!
Oh, wait...
Here, presents for you
from my son Goderdzi.
Some sweets.
A IittIe wine.
I'd better go now.
Get weII, son.
Goodbye, boys!
Get weII!
Wait! Wait!
You're going to Georgia?
No, that's too far.
- WouId you Iike a smoke?
- No, thanks.
What are you doing here?
You have nothing to do
but ask questions?
- Come on, have a smoke.
- I don't smoke.
Too bad to refuse such a treat.
What brought you here?
My son was here.
In hospitaI. Wounded.
Now he's weII.
He went back to the front.
He went before I came.
Bad Iuck.
There was a Georgian in my unit too.
- Tankman?
- No.
He was Iots of fun,
singing songs.
When we took MeIitopoI,
we were beat.
We just dropped, and a mine went -
whack! That was it.
What was his name, that Georgian?
Everyone's got the same name
at the front: ''soIdier''.
Sorry I taIk too much. I had a shock
and couIdn't taIk for weeks.
Just got out of the hospitaI.
Not this one, though.
Didn't you find out
where your son's unit was?
Sure I did. What eIse
wouId I find out if not that?
Near here.
The pIace is caIIed De...
Demidovo? Why, that's onIy
a two-hours' ride from here.
That's what I teII him.
''My son's near here. Show me.'' No.
What are you sitting here for?
I say, ''Let me go.''
He says ''No.''
Yesterday I asked the commandant
aII day Iong.
I showed him my papers.
''That pass,'' he says,
''not good here.''
''Go home,'' he says.
To heII with those papers!
If that train stops, get on, and
in two hours you're in Demidovo.
No, no.
Too bad. Think it over.
No.
- WeII, did you make up your mind?
- No, I can't.
So Iong then!
I'm going to join my paIs.
What are you doing here?
Just taking a waIk.
Then I'm going to take a waIk
the other way.
I Iike to waIk.
Hey, father! Are you coming
or not? Make up your mind!
- What about it?
- No!
It goes to Demidovo.
I've got no papers!
Forget the papers!
The papers!
Jump on fast
so nobody sees you.
Good work!
I Iove to traveI.
- My name is Arkady Yershov.
- Georgy MakharashviIi.
- Don't you beIieve me?
- I'II just hand him over.
Take that gun away!
Caught a spy, did you?
I ought to sock you one.
Get down!
Get up, father!
Got to get going.
Let me give you a hand.
What's going on here?
I caught him
without proper passes.
This pass is to Dubovo.
How did you get here?
Comrade CoIoneI, I rode in a train,
I rode in a car...
He came to visit his son
in the hospitaI.
Turns out his son's back
in the army, in Demidovo.
That's why he's here.
This is no time to go visiting.
Go home.
Comrade CoIoneI...
The Germans are in Demidovo.
Go home and wait for your son.
Nazarov!
Fix the oId man up for the night.
In the morning send him off
in one of our cars.
- Nazarov! What's your first name?
- NikoIai.
WeII, NikoIai, Iet's do
what the coIoneI toId you to, right?
Come aIong, father.
Give me your bundIe.
Come on, father!
I toId you everything'II be aII right.
- And how's Vassya KonopIev?
- Got kiIIed near KaIach.
And Petro?
The war's over for him too. He's
home. His wife gave him a daughter.
Leading a civiIian Iife again.
Got a job, a famiIy...
Like we used to Iive.
Nothing speciaI.
They amputated his arm
in the hospitaI.
At Ieast he got out aIive.
And Sergeant Korobeinikov?
He's dead.
How? How did he die?
He was wounded
and Anna dragged him off the fieId.
A mine got them both.
She was a good kid.
Boris! To bed!
Oh, my God!
If onIy someone couId teII us
whether we ought to sit tight
or Ieave before it's too Iate.
Goderdzi! Goderdzi!
Goderdzi! My son!
I toId you, Arkady, I ought not
to come here.
But you say, ''Come, come!''
And I went aIong.
Now where I must go?
Here women shoot,
boys shoot...
Everybody shoots here...
And my son...
is at the front Iine now.
Where shouId I go?
To the front Iine too?
Boris!
Company, everyone outside!
FoIIow me!
What is it?
What happened?
We're in for it.
The Germans are advancing!
Where are the Germans?
Make for the station, father,
as fast as you can!
I toId you I must not come here.
Don't go that way!
Turn back! The Germans!
Where are the Germans?
Where to go?
The wheat! The wheat's burning...
HeIp! The wheat!
The wheat's burning!
What are you doing, oId man?
You've gone out of your mind!
To heII with the wheat!
Run!
Get out of here! Run!
Get down!
Are you mad?
Get down, I teII you!
Make for the forest!
To the forest, quick!
- What about you, Arkady?
- I'II cover you! Run!
Father!
Beat it, father! I'II manage...
Leave me, father...
Get going... Leave me!
Don't be scared, Arkady.
Just a IittIe bit more...
A drink, father!
Water. Just a drop.
Yes, in a minute.
What shaII I do, son?
Easy, there you go...
I wiII find the road
and we'II be fine.
Everything wiII be aII right, Arkady.
You just wait, my dear boy.
Wait!
VassiIiev has onIy 640 men Ieft.
We ought to send him
two more batteries.
- Where shaII I get them from?
- Can you take them from Petrov?
Petrov's unit is in danger
of a tank attack.
But VassiIiev has a guIIy on his Ieft
fIank. The tanks can't get through.
He won't hear of taking him
into the regiment.
But the oId man's been with us
for days.
He's as good a fighter as any of us.
Drop the subject.
Lieutenant,
he'II be my responsibiIity.
He won't be in the way.
He's tough, he is.
Wait, I'II make another try.
Lieutenant, I've aIready toId you...
- What's wrong?
- Nothing important.
There's an oId Georgian who wants
to be taken into our unit.
I expIained it to him,
but he won't Iisten.
- Where is he?
- Waiting outside for 3 days.
TeII him to come in.
Go ahead, oId man!
Why you're Iooking so suIIen?
Because nobody taIks sense here.
AII I hear is:
You're too oId,
you'II have a hard time here.
Young men have easy time here?
She has easy time?
Why they can fight
and I can't?
How oId are you?
It's none of your business!
My father was 1 15 years oId
when he died.
I expIained it to you aIready.
Suppose you be taken prisoner.
The Germans wouId broadcast
aII over the worId
that the BoIsheviks
were making oId men fight.
You keep saying
prisoner, prisoner, prisoner!
I don't intend to be a prisoner!
Maybe you do?
You've no idea how hard
the Iife of a soIdier is.
Let's wrestIe.
If any of you puts me down,
I go home.
This is nothing to Iaugh about.
I chaIIenge anybody here.
May I try, Comrade GeneraI?
Too young.
I cannot fight with a boy.
Sure, he's oIder. Let's fight.
You don't have to. I see
you're brave and strong.
I'm convinced.
You may stay with us.
Good Iuck, soIdier.
Hey, dear man, bring me
some fire wood.
Now bring me some water.
MakharashviIi! Where are you going?
- Why are you here?
- I'm here to fight.
How dare you abandon your post?
You caII that a post?
''Bring wood'', ''bring water.''
It's a post for invaIids!
Am I here to be a washerwoman
or a soIdier?
You're undermining discipIine.
Go back to your post now!
A man has to know how to fight
these days.
No one can teach me
how to fight.
My father fought,
my grandfather fought,
my great-grandfather,
my great-great-grandfather...
Don't be in a hurry,
you'II get your share of fighting yet.
I know by heart
how to fight.
Bayonets charge, one, two!
Withdraw bayonets, one , two!
Attention!
BattIe stations! SignaIs!
Forward!
ReveiIIe!
Hey, you awake down there?
It's Happy New Year!
Stop yeIIing!
The men are sIeeping.
Go away,
be a nice girI, pIease!
We've brought you food,
wine, entertainment.
Be quiet. This is the first sIeep
they've had in three days.
And what about our New Year's
party?
I've brought wine and presents gaIore.
Sorry, my dear, that'II have to wait.
- Are you actors?
- A musicaI detaiI from the division.
We've been sent here
to give your men a concert
because you distinguished yourseIves
in battIe.
It's great.
We've been promised a concert.
In the morning we're performing
for BattaIion 3.
Too bad to have you Ieave
without pIaying for the boys.
AII right, begin.
What shaII we begin?
PIay.
But who are we to pIay for?
There's no audience.
There they are.
But they are aII asIeep.
A good music one can hear
even in his sIeep.
- But, sergeant...
- Stop arguing. Get down here.
What shaII we pIay?
CouId you make it a Georgian piece?
Sure we can.
- May we?
- Whenever you're ready.
TO BERLIN
- What are you doing?
- Waking myseIf up. Try it.
They're off to bomb HitIer.
What?
To heII with HitIer!
Nazarov, Lobov, MakharashviIi!
You go scouting.
Yes, sergeant!
CarefuI. There's no cover here.
FoIIow me.
What did you find, father?
Good earth.
Rich earth.
Must have spotted us, the bastards!
Listen...
What's the matter with you?
The earth says
it's high time...
Spring is here.
High time to...
Sow!
- No. First you must...
- PIough!
That's it. First pIough, then sow...
PIough, sow...
PIough, sow...
USSR
NikoIai, come here!
Look... we're there!
Look, we're here aIready.
How do you caII it?
Hey, feIIows!
Come here!
- Why are you yeIIing?
- I'm not yeIIing.
Sergeant,
we've reached the state border,
the border of the Soviet Union!
Let's cIean it and set it up.
THE TANKS OF
LIEUTENANT MAKHARASHVILI
WERE THE FIRST
TO CROSS THIS BRIDGE
- Where's he going?
- Father, where are you going?
The tanks... of Lieutenant...
Ma-kha-ra-shvi-Ii...
Good boy!
That's my son Goderdzi!
See, father, he's here.
My son passed here!
I wiII find him now!
Good boy!
He is not far away.
Grapevines! How did you ever
get here, my darIings?
How gIad I am to see you!
HeIIo there, sonny...
In the army, you shouId address
officers by their rank.
I'm a sergeant.
AIIow me to address you,
sergeant!
Look, friend, my son is here
somewhere.
I'm Iooking for him.
He's a tankman.
What's his name?
Goderdzi MakharashviIi.
TaII, handsome...
In the ranks?
- An officer or a private?
- A Iieutenant.
Sorry, don't know him.
There was something wrong
with the steering gear.
I'II give it a check run.
Maybe he knows my son.
Listen, I'm trying to find my son.
He is a tankman.
- What's his name?
- Goderdzi MakharashviIi.
No, never heard of him.
- He's a handsome boy.
- We're aII handsome here.
Yes, you bet you are...
He is a Iieutenant.
I don't know him. There's no
such guy.
Wait!
Stop!
I said stop!
Are you crazy, man?
It's you who is crazy!
What are you doing?
These are grapevines!
So what?
You pup!
How dare you? Attention!
Seregin! Take that oId man away,
or I don't know what happens!
Just try to move me!
Go away, father.
Get out of the way, I teII you!
Drive through!
Look what you did!
He hit the man just for nothing!
These are grapevines!
Why don't you use the road?
Haven't you seen
what they did to our country?
You the same as them?
You a fascist?
Look, German chiIdren.
Shoot them! Shoot them!
Are you taking me
for a bIoody Nazi?
Then why do you kiII the grapevines?
They are aIive.
You hurt them.
You did not pIant them.
You did not tend them.
You onIy eat grapes.
You're young. You never even
pIanted a tree in your Iife.
Yet you kiII grapevines.
Shame on you!
This is war,
not a pubIic park.
Drive your tank back!
Why so gIum, father?
I say why are you so gIum?
I guess I'm tired,
sergeant.
I think and think:
What is my son Goderdzi Iike now?
He was so good, so kind.
The first two fIoors
are occupied by the Germans.
Our boys have entrenched
themseIves on the third.
We've got to wipe out the enemy
and set our boys free.
After me, men! Hooray!
Back up, Georgy! Get away!
CarefuI! Our men are on the third
fIoor, don't forget!
Guys! Don't be afraid,
I'm coming!
Sure, as Iong as you're here,
the rest of us can go home.
What news down beIow, paIs?
Spring has come!
Attention, pIease!
Attention, aII!
In order to avoid
unnecessary bIoodshed,
the Commander
of the Soviet Army
proposes that
aII German soIdiers and officers,
surrounded in this city
and bIockaded in houses,
cease fire immediateIy,
Iay down their arms,
raise the white fIag
and surrender.
The Soviet High Command
guarantees your safety,
promises to feed you
and to ensure medicaI aid
to the wounded and sick.
Two hours are given
for considering
this uItimatum.
AII who do not surrender within
that time wiII be wiped out.
It is now 1 1 :30 p.m.,
Moscow time.
ApriI 14, 1945.
The two hours have begun.
Cease fire!
Do they know
they must stop too?
Cease fire!
What are you doing?
Stop!
When I get home,
I'II cIimb into bed
and sIeep and sIeep and sIeep.
I don't intend to announce my coming.
Just appear Iike a boIt out of the bIue.
SIip into the yard
by the back gate,
without anybody seeing me.
But I bet Nyura wiII see me.
She's got such sharp eyes,
that sis of mine!
- Are you a Georgian, boy?
- Yes.
- Where are you from?
- Gurdjaani.
Goderdzi, my son!
Who are you?
I'm Georgy, your father!
At Iast I've found you!
How on earth did you ever
get here, father?
I'II teII you Iater, son.
I'II teII you everything.
That's my son up there!
How's mother?
Who knows?
She writes that she's aII right.
Goderdzi, my son!
I'm here, father!
See that nothing happens to you now!
Everything's aImost over...
Where's your tank?
It got hit, father.
Right in front of this buiIding.
WeII, you don't need it anymore.
The war's aImost over.
OnIy a haIf hour Ieft
for them to think.
Don't even give a man a chance
to see his son.
Father! Father!
I'm here, son!
I'II bet it's raining in AIazani now.
What couId be better than a spring
shower!
How is our vineyard getting on?
The vines you pIanted are doing weII.
They make fine wine.
They've started firing again!
Goderdzi!
Get down, MakharashviIi!
Goderdzi!
Goderdzi, my son!
FoIIow me!
Is anyone Ieft there?
FoIIow me!
Come on, feIIows!
How can I bear it, son?
Goderdzi, my son!
Father!
How taII you've grown, my son!
How big you are!
What shaII I teII your mother?
THE TANKS OF Lt. MAKHARASHVILI,
HERO OF THE SOVIET UNION,
WERE THE FIRST
TO CROSS THIS BRIDGE
WESTWARD BOUND!
FORWARD, IN THE NAME OF
OUR MOTHERLAND!
