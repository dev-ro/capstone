Hey stranger.
How's it feel to be back?
Where's your boy?
He's inside.
You okay?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Are you almost done? I need to
rinse my hair in a sec.
Why are you being so quiet?
I'm just thinking.
'bout what?
We'll talk about
it when we get back.
It was the limoncello year -
It was. And she was like,
"girls, it's dessert."
She used to get wasted on her
own.
And she was, like, laughing hysterically,
and then she whipped off her pants -
Oh my god, in the living room
when we were playing a game -
It was so weird. Wait, pull it
back.
She was just wearing this, like,
onesie. shirt-dress onesie
And then she was laughing
hysterically, remember? She would laugh -
And then she would
laugh and make herself fart -
I haven't inherited that.
That's really scary.
I've been touching them all
summer.
Well, you'd know if you
touched one of those. Trust me.
Yeah, Dylan got one the other
day.
What,
do they just latch into your skin?
Well he just
kept itching his eyes.
Yeah, we always had good
holidays.
Remember that holiday in the south of France
- the one where it rained all the time?
And I had to save you from those
BMX-er's in the park.
That's when dad started calling
you my White Knight.
Was it?
He, uh,
sounds like a white supremacist.
It's Arthurian.
I know.
No, that was when I used to pretend to
take you to those swimming lessons you hated.
No, no, it was before that I'm
sure -
Yeah, no, we used to play knock out ginger remember?
Then I'd wet your hair with the hose outside -
No, no, no - it was when mum
grabbed my arm remember?
She chased me down the hall and then you just
jumped out - out of nowhere - and were like:
"I'll fucking kill you, I'll rip off
your head and shit down your neck!"
Jesus. How old were you?
She was ten!
Ten years old and
already bustin' balls.
♪ "When the boat comes in." ♪
This game is fucking
pretentious.
It's the oldest game in the
world.
Oh, fuck you.
Don't rage-quit just 'cause I'm
winning.
Oh, like that time you threw a
strop at Orhan's
because I invaded Enclave of the
Bear?
We had an alliance, actually.
Orhan still asks about you all
the time.
Oh does he?
Sexy Greta. Where is she?
My sexy kebab woman, where is
she?
Who, uh, who the fuck -
Oh no.
Who the fuck is...
Who the fuck is Orhan?
No one.
Just an old mate from uni.
Oh, just an old mate from uni is
he?
Hitting on me wife?
What the fuck kind of name is
Orhan?
No one Bubba.
Later Bubba.
Hey!
Wanna fly?
Yeah.
Ready?
One, two, three -
Kill it.
No.
It's only gonna bite you later
on, just -
Just leave it.
Too many legs.
Shall we play one?
Yeah, let's play one.
Boom.
AAAHH!
Oh my God, you fuck!
Seriously, who the fuck is
Orhan?
Oh my god you're so jealous -
Yeah no, I'm not - I don't get
jealous.
Yeah, right, right.
I've never gotten jealous -
Sarah Ashdown?
Sarah Ashdown is not a name that
I even recall.
You would, like, follow her. You
stalked her.
I didn't stalk her.
You totally stalked -
I followed her -
Yeah, that's not - it's
not stalking if there's two of you.
Your freckles have
really gotten intense this year.
Have they?
They get more intense every
year.
Freckles - it's like - y'know
- It's like a fine wine thing.
They really - they mature, they
age, they enrich.
You really bulked out.
You're not a little twinkie
anymore.
- I bulked out?
- Yeah.
It took a while.
You guys should stay the whole
week.
I feel like we might have to go
back early.
Does he just really not like it
here?
No.
I can tell you're lying because
your eyes do this thing.
No they don't. What thing?
They do this thing where they go
up to the corner.
That just means I'm thinking.
Yeah, thinking about the next
lie you're gonna tell.
Okay.
You should just talk to her
about it.
Might make you feel better.
That's not a good idea.
No?
Why not?
- Because, she's just gonna try
to give me advice
and then she'll get all annoyed
if I don't take it.
She might do that.
But, she might not do that also.
- You can't even keep
a straight face and say that.
She's not worse at that.
Right.
Come back more often.
That's not fair.
You know how busy I am - I've offered to
pay for her ticket, like, a million times.
I think she sometimes feels like you're
trying to prove how much better your life is.
If she'd have visited you more often I'm sure you
would have found her a much more appropriate husband.
Yeah, she really did scrape the
barrel.
She was. And there I was.
Just you at the bottom?
"I'm here."
You know that feeling
when you scratch your armpit
and then you're like... and you sniff
it, and then you take a sneaky lick?
I was with you
right up until the end.
I don't get hunting.
Why?
What do you get out of all this?
Of hurting animals?
Joy. Deep pleasure.
You're not gonna let it go if you catch
it, are you? You're gonna kill it.
Yeah, only because this area is
overpopulated.
I'm keeping the balance.
Okay.
I'm singlehandedly saving -
- 'cause I can see all
of these rabbits - these rabid -
- They're coming
after you - you gotta -
running around the forest -
- creating
ecological imbalance.
Besides, you eat meat.
I eat fish.
That's, that's meat.
No, fish don't feel pain in the
same way.
Lobsters feel tons of pain.
I don't know that you know that.
I do know that.
Those all dry?
Yeah.
I can't believe you convinced
her to start eating meat.
You've brainwashed her.
She just doesn't do everything
you say anymore.
What you gonna do
when your contract ends?
I was thinking of
getting a place near you guys.
What just you?
I meant "we."
Not gonna go back to London?
I miss you.
Do you?
Yeah,
I miss what we used to be like.
You guys probably
wouldn't fit in here.
I mean, who knows,
maybe it will just be me.
What's going on with you two
anyway?
I dunno.
You seem really distant from
each other.
Yeah, the move's been really
stressful.
Well, how often do you guys
fuck?
What?
Fucking keeps you close to the person so
you're not just buddies who live together.
That's your problem -
If you're not having sex you start to look at
other people, and then you start to think:
"maybe with that person the sexual
attraction will last forever."
Sometimes you need to force yourself
to fuck the person you're with.
Then sex just becomes a way to avoid
dealing with all your other problems -
Otherwise things will fizzle out because you think you've lost
your attraction to them and your relationship becomes retarded.
Don't use that word.
Retarded: Held back. Restricted.
So you force yourself to have sex with
Dylan, even though you don't want to?
I'm just saying, you don't
exactly try that hard.
You're a fucking exhibitionist.
Sex is good for you.
You need to show Caleb you love him. Maybe he's
getting out now before you can really hurt him.
Relationships take work.
It's not that they're shit all the time, and you're
compromising yourself. But you should try hard.
Y'know, if you really love the person you wanna
do the work 'cause it doesn't feel like work.
Not everyone has what you and
Dylan have.
Yeah, that looks like plenty.
You know how fast it burns?
I do.
'cause I'm a woodsman.
There we go baby!
You know when you chop wood you
look just like dad.
That's not an insult. You have
his exact stance.
I know, it's like... he did it
in such a... such a dainty way.
He could do it really well,
but it was just like, so... fluid. Y'know?
- It's like he was, like,
following the axe, follow the axe.
It became like an extension of
his limbs.
It was so - it was just like - all
his movements were so flopsy mopsy.
He was really flopsy. Like,
so...
I think I'm gonna go to bed.
Night night.
Goodnight.
What?
You look like shit.
I was thinking on the drive over here
about this awful dream that I had.
You were in the next room from
me...
and I could hear you coughing
and breathing all weird -
but I didn't think anything of it.
I thought maybe you just had...
I don't know, the flu or
something, and...
Finally I knew that something was
wrong so I went into the next room...
And you were hanging from a belt
by your neck.
and... I felt this horrible
sense of dread.
Like, this whole time I'd just been sitting in
the next room while you were hanging yourself.
What is wrong with you?
You're so fucked up and twisted.
I don't give a fuck about your
dream.
I asked him to fucking do this.
I mean...
I mean what the fuck is he
playing at?
It's his family.
Watch he's gonna turn up now and
act like nothing's happened
and then I'm gonna look like a
bitch for being in a bad mood.
I'm gonna fucking kill him.
You don't have to worry.
There's like, fifty fucking people coming to this thing,
and I still haven't made the fucking ice cream.
Well, I can do that.
Yeah.
What? I can.
Fuck!
Listen I don't wanna do this right now. If you can't
help me without starting a fight then just go inside.
I'm not starting a fight. Greta.
He insisted on hosting this year.
Motherfucker.
He's taking advantage of you.
Don't.
They're not even your family.
I know what you're doing.
Stop.
He's not good for you.
Oh, 'cause you know what is?
Y'know, I didn't even want you
guys coming here this year.
It was Dylan's idea. He thought I
should give you a second chance.
Look, I don't know what he told
you -
You can't stand me being happy,
can you?
I just want you to see him for
who he really is.
You are so full of shit. It
blows my fucking mind.
Can we just be honest for one
second?
Honest?
You know when Sheldon Val called
me a slut?
You went to his house and you poured
bleach on his mum's flowerbeds.
I begged you not to and you, you
did it anyway.
And his family hated me then,
for years.
And you went around feeling so
good.
You landed this left hook on my behalf.
Everyone called you my White Knight.
But you're not.
It was more important for you to be my crusader
than to actually give a fuck about my feelings.
Look. Greta, I understand how
hard this must be for you.
Let's just pretend none of this
ever happened.
Let's just...
Reset.
You've created a reality that is
completely different from everyone else's.
Where you're this saint who gets
tricked into doing bad things.
The truth is you never once
thought of me.
I always thought of you.
Maybe when we were kids you'd tell
yourself you were protecting me. But...
you can't now, can you?
So you wanna believe your version of
things Miriam. Go ahead. Believe in them.
I bet it makes you feel fucking
righteous. But...
don't for a minute pretend that
you're doing any of this shit for me.
Are we done?
Thought maybe you weren't
coming.
Told her I was heading to the
farm a day early to help my parents.
What if she calls the house?
She won't.
If she does?
She leaves a message. I was cleaning the
barbecue, didn't hear the phone ring.
What if she calls your mobile?
I'll fake that I'm there.
You fake that you're there?
Yeah. What are you doing right
now?
I don't know.
I need a drink.
I thought about
this all fucking day.
In the shower.
At work.
On the drive over.
Even fucking jerked off to you.
Thanks for making me feel so
special.
You know what I was thinking
about all day?
What?
I was thinking about that night
by the fire.
I thought we were past that.
I never heard how you felt.
What it meant to you.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It meant a lot. I have a vivid
memory of it.
Vivid?
I think about it all the time.
So do I.
You go.
Tell me what you were thinking
about when you jerked off?
You know what I was thinking
about.
Tell me.
We were by the fire.
You were telling
me how mean I was.
Don't go so far back.
I ran my hand along your
thighs...
along your back.
You still had your swimsuit on,
which was sexy as fuck.
And it was dark outside.
Don't move.
What are you doing?
And?
I pulled down your pants
and ran my hand along your ass.
I found my way under your
swimsuit.
How did I feel?
Soft.
Then what?
My dick started to get hard.
What was I doing?
You were lying
there with your back to me.
You pushed up against me.
I started kissing your neck and
you let out this... moan.
This soft, real sexy moan.
Then what?
I pulled over your swimsuit and took out my hard
cock and slowly slid it into your wet pussy.
Was I wet?
You were so wet. You wanted it
so fucking bad.
Did I like it?
You pressed your tight little
ass right into me.
Did I say anything to you?
You said "don't stop."
Did you?
No.
No?
Tell me what
you want me to do to you.
I want you to grab my hard cock
and rub it all over your wet lips.
And then what?
I want you to tease me with the
tip of your tongue.
Playing with the edge of my
cock.
Then I want you to taste me.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I have this dream
this recurring dream where I go into
this tree, and there's a door in the tree
and I go down this really long staircase and at the bottom there's
this old couple that lives there, and it's a house inside the tree.
In the kitchen they have all of these boxes on the windowsill, and
in each one of the boxes is one of my cats that's passed away.
But they're alive, they're not, like, skeletons of cats, they're
alive. So they open the box and the cat's there and it comes out.
And, I can play with all of my
dead cats.
And I just go into this tree and hang out
with this old couple and all of my cats.
Aw.
What happened to that chemistry
teacher that always used to say "top banana"?
Yeah, remember Mr. Pink?
Who's Mr. Pink?
Chemistry.
Mr. Bevan?
Yes! Oh my God, he was so hot.
No. You were the only one who
thought that.
You could always see his nipples
through his shirt.
Ew. Ew.
His round little nips.
He got fired.
Why?
He went on this big bender
and...
like, fucked a bunch of
prostitutes in his office.
How do you know all these
juicies?
You're out of the loop. This is
common knowledge.
What about that anorexic biology
teacher?
Ms. Phelps?
She died.
Yeah, heart attack or stroke or
something.
Shit.
Remember Mr. Bergman?
Oh my God yes! I loved him.
They found a bunch of Nazi
peraphernalia in his basement.
What?
Yeah, like, medals and flags
and this giant swastika dildo -
You shithead!
Did Ms. Phelps actually die?
Uh, no.
You fucker!
She's still there.
I fully believed you. You total
fucker.
How fucking drunk are you?
You are so mean.
You bought it.
Oh, my God. Oh my God. I'm -
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
My God, I'm so shitty.
- It meant nothing.
It didn't mean anything.
Everybody's shitty.
Everybody's at least medium
shitty. It's okay.
I do really selfish things.
What - why? Why do you think
that?
I kissed my sister's husband!
Okay, you - okay. Okay.
Sometimes I pretend to be really sick,
so that Caleb will look after me all day.
I pretend I only get one week of vacation
so I don't have to see my mum as much.
I love your mum.
Yeah, I know that you do.
Why would you do that?
I don't know. I wanna do it.
I guess we're just both awful
fucking people.
And Caleb's always trying so hard and I'm always
in this horrid position of having to reject him.
You're too hard on yourself.
We haven't had sex in almost a
year.
Why?
I don't know.
Does he have an anteater penis?
What?
Like, a long, like, foreskin...
What is that?
Tell me.
I only wanna fuck him when I'm
drunk.
I know that sounds weird.
And I want to be attracted to him again.
I just... don't know how.
You can't force yourself to be
attracted to someone.
Maybe I'm just not trying hard
enough.
Or maybe he's not right for you.
I want him to be right for me.
It's not like you have a choice
in it.
Free will is an illusion.
You sound like Sam Harris.
What's wrong with Sammy?
Sammy?
He's not Sammy Davis Jr.
- I don't think
Sammy's a name that he has.
But think about it - do you
choose your feelings?
That's different.
Okay, what about your thoughts? Right now
are you in control of what thoughts appear?
Yeah, actually.
Really?
Like, right now I'm choosing to
think that you're being a cunt.
Cock face.
Is that your cock face? It's
like Sean Connery.
Why does your cock look like
Sean Connery?
I think that question answers itself.
Why does my cock look like Sean Connery?
What cock doesn't look like Sean Connery?
It's a compliment.
Mine looks like De Niro.
Your cock looks like De Niro?
Like that. It's the face of a
cock.
Why is one eye all swollen?
Stop it!
It's the one eye more closed
than the other.
Do you think I'm a good person?
No.
Seriously though.
I think it's like what Lennon
said:
"We're all Hitler, we're all Christ, and we
just have to work on the good parts of us."
And then he beat his wife.
Doesn't make it not true.
That was the Hitler part.
That was, that was the Hitler
part.
The Christ past
was singing "Imagine."
Y'know we're complicated people.
Nobody's simple.
But how much of me is Hitler?
I don't know.
Probably more than most people.
Definitely the moustache.
For you? I think it's more the
hating the Jews...
than the moustache. But the
moustache also doesn't help.
I think you're a good person.
I like that you think that. It's
nice.
If it helps I'm sure Greta
doesn't think I'm good.
She does.
I like talking to you.
I like talking to you. You
weirdo.
I've wanted you for years.
Don't.
Stop.
Ah!
Ah!
Your heart's racing.
You're so warm.
You're freezing.
You still drunk?
Do I smell?
I don't mind.
Liar.
I don't understand why you have
to get so shit-faced.
What time is it?
I dunno. It's early.
Try and get some sleep.
I wanna fuck.
No, that's not a good idea.
Not like this.
But you're hard.
Come on. What are you doing?
What is this?
Why do you have to be such a girl about it?
Why can't we just fuck?
I'm not gonna fuck you if you
insult me.
Okay. I'm sorry.
Don't.
Miriam, you're drunk.
I wanna be close to you.
What, do I repulse you sober?
No. I wanna make you feel good.
Ow. Fuck.
Hey!
You alright?
Don't touch me.
C'mon.
Look, I'm feeling fucking guilty.
You're feeling guilty.
- Why would
I be feeling guilty?
- and it never
should've happened.
we fucked up.
You fucked up.
Don't do that.
I was asleep and you fucked me.
You think that I...
Really?
Come on.
Look, I'm -
- I'm not gonna talk to Greta.
I just wanna sort this out between us -
- That you kissed me?
That you made a choice to kiss me?
No,
I told you that didn't mean anything.
Yeah, yeah.
You were pressing up against me -
No I wasn't! I didn't -
We had a lot to drink.
don't rewrite what happened.
- No, you did
things, you said things.
- and you stayed - we both
said it was a mistake and we both stayed.
Why did you tell me about your
fucking, your sex life with Caleb?
- I was just trying
to work out what I was -
- what so now
you're accusing me of -
You said that actually -
- Let's not fucking
fight over who said what.
None of it fucking matters.
I didn't want it.
That - that,
that is a fucking lie and you know it!
I thought you
were better than that.
I'm sorry. We're gonna work this
out.
It's gonna be okay.
No, it's not.
I didn't mean to blame you, I
know that I'm half to blame.
I don't know you.
You know me.
Don't say that.
I know we fucked up. Okay?
You're right. But the truth is
I'm glad we got it out of our system.
I know that's a fucked up thing to say
but look at me and say you haven't thought about it before
'cause I know you have or you woundn't have kissed me.
What is it that you're doing
right now?
You told me last night
that you do selfish things -
and I should have realized that when you
kissed me, I should have stopped things but -
I did stop things.
- You were emotionally
vulnerable. Touching -
In confidence, I opened up to you about things I
was really ashamed of, 'cause I wanted your help.
I don't mean you're a bad
person.
I'm not gonna tell her anything.
You guys have always had this fucked
up sister thing. You're resentful.
All I'm saying is, you and me,
we're in this together.
And we've hurt each other
but we care about each other.
Okay.
♪ Call us back,
do doot do do, call us back... ♪
Hey. It's me. Um...
You're not picking up so...
Look, I don't wanna fight, okay? I don't wanna go
to your parents' thing without sorting things out.
I'm ready to talk when you are.
Just call me back.
Oi!
Hey!
Hey.
Give those back to her. Give
those back to her.
Who the fuck are you?
Give them back right now.
HUH?
I fucking saw you. Okay,
I have it on my phone, I fucking saw you.
You saw me?
Are you okay?
- It's okay.
Don't worry, I'm fine.
Go back in my car?
Or what?
Or fucking what mate? Or what?
Did he hurt you?
You stop!
- Are you gonna fucking let
her speak? Or are you just gonna speak?
Are you just gonna get up -
You think you scare me?
- Or what,
or fucking what mate?
You think you scare me? You
fucking don't. Yeah, I know men like you -
Don't fucking touch me mate.
Don't fucking touch me.
Go back in your
car, do you understand?
Or what? Or fucking what mate?
Or fucking what?
Please,
don't speak to him like that.
Stop, stop, stop.
It's okay. It's nothing.
I can't believe you
convinced me to do this.
I promise you
it's - it's good for you.
Are we going all the way around?
Just to the island and back.
At least I'm
starting to feel warm.
Me too.
Have you ever thought about what it
would've been like if you'd stayed in London?
Yeah, all the time.
Why don't you come back with me?
My life's here.
What if I moved here and we got
a place together?
What? You and me?
Yeah, like an investment.
Where am I gonna get all this
money?
I'm talking about us starting
over.
I don't need to start over.
Why are you being weird?
I have to tell you something and
I don't want you to freak out.
Why would I freak out?
It's about Dylan.
Okay.
Don't get angry.
I'm not angry.
It's gonna make you really
upset.
I know how much you love
him, and how much he means to you.
I admire how loyal you are to
him.
He seems like he's really sweet
and compassionate.
Like, he's got all of these
emotions that he just can't control.
What are you doing right now?
Did you know that when we were kids
he used to pull the wings off flies?
That's a stupid thing to say.
It's the truth.
What's your point?
I'm trying to tell you something-
Tell me what?
Last night, by the fire, at some
point I fell asleep.
And when I woke up -
I didn't know what was
happening.
What did you do?
I didn't do anything.
Don't do this.
I was unconscious.
He was on top of me -
Don't.
I didn't realize what was
happening -
Stop.
He wouldn't listen to me Greta-
Don't.
Miriam stop.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Please listen to me -
He's been nothing but kind to
you, and whatever happened it wasn't this.
You fucked up.
And you can't even own up to it.
It's pathetic, and fucking
disgusting.
Miriam! Miriam!
Miriam!
Miriam!
And it doesn't put
you guys off your appetite?
No I think it's good to know the whole
process, otherwise you take this stuff for granted.
There was this point where I thought, if I eat meat
I should be able to do the whole thing, y'know?
I don't think
I could stomach it.
There you are.
I didn't know your sister was
such a badass with a knife.
Oh, she's just trying to impress
you.
I think it's cool. What chick
knows how to skin a rabbit?
I actually find
it incredibly rewarding.
It's helped me develop as a
person actually.
Has it, actually?
Yeah.
Keep the little shoes.
Your breath smells like a
raccoon shat in your mouth.
That's so cold.
Haven't showered yet.
Did you sleep by the fire?
No. Crashed on the couch.
Next time wake me.
So what have you learned?
What?
You said that it's helped you
develop as a person.
Yeah. I think it builds
character.
What have you learned about your
character?
That I'm capable.
Of cruelty?
The first time I did this I was only half
way through when I thought I was gonna throw up -
but I forced myself to keep
going.
'Cause I've always relied on other
people for this kind of thing, y'know,
the stuff I didn't wanna do.
And then something happened midway
through, and, I had to face myself.
And you realized how much of a
fucking coward you were?
Hey!
What?
It's empowering knowing you don't
need anyone to look after you.
I'm proud of you.
Thanks Binky.
Have you guys read that
book, um, "My Side of the Mountain?"
Why are you being
such a fake fuck right now?
You're acting like she's your
best friend.
We're just trying
to have a good time, Miriam.
You don't even like them.
Don't be a dick, okay,
I know you're in a mood right now -
What was it
that you said in the car?
- This is embarassing.
You know that, right?
that she's a self-centred little brat
who always has to have things her own way.
You took what
I said out of context.
No, no, no I wanna hear
you defend yourself - go on.
I'm not doing this with you.
I'm not doing this.
Do you wanna do the honours?
Yeah.
So, did I live?
What?
In your dream
did I survive?
You were coughing and I was in
the next room
and for a while I didn't do
anything.
And I realized something must be
wrong so...
I walked into the room where you
were hanging yourself
and I saw you.
And I felt like...
Why didn't I come in earlier,
why did I just sit in the other room?
When those moments could have
made the difference.
And your face was all red but...
you were still breathing, and I
ran over to you
and tried to get you down. But I couldn't lift
you and take the belt off at the same time.
so I just tried to hold you up.
I couldn't stop thinking how
I didn't want your last thing that you
experienced in the world to be me panicking.
I wanted it to be of someone
that really loved you.
And I kept just saying "it's
okay, it's okay, it's okay"
and I was holding you,
and just saying that it's gonna be okay,
and I knew it wasn't gonna be
okay.
Then I woke up.
I love you.
