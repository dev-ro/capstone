This is how it always ends.
A little magic, a little smoke.
Something floating.
But it doesn't work
without the right means:
A little laughter,
a man, a beautiful woman.
And love.
Let's start at the beginning.
First , a man.
No, he is not alone.
Yet.
That's the first step.
The man.
Then comes the laughter.
The woman. Love.
Watch him.
We begin like this.
It's not like the beginning.
So take it easy.
But it's important. Believe me.
A man comes into a bar.
He sees a beautiful woman.
Do they know each other?
It doesn't look like it.
But even so ...
They seem acquainted.
Who knows whom?
Is this a beginning or a end?
That's what we're about to see.
The beginning and the end.
Love and goodbye.
I know I don't need to say so,
but anyway.
Remember: it is all film.
It is all a construction.
But even so, it hurts.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Coming?
- Coming?
- Yes. To Rome.
We'll have to hurry
if we're to make that plane.
- Or what?
- No, I haven't time.
- Alex.
- Aimee.
- Aimee?
- Yes.
- Like her?
- Yes. You know ...
Yes, I know. Perhaps
you'd rather go to Paris, then?
No, I wouldn't.
Oh ...
Maybe we should wait a little.
- Yes. I think so.
- Can I get you something?
I'd like a cup of coffee.
You're not hungry? That's if they've
got anything. Two coffees, please.
Just what do you want?
What do I want?
I just want to go to Rome.
Maybe it's too ... Thanks.
Maybe it's too soon.
- We need to know each other better.
- I think so, yes.
All I know is that
you are very, very beautiful.
- If I may say so.
- Yes, you certainly may.
Is that all you know?
I know that if you are my dream,
I am yours.
What do you want?
- I want to say goodbye.
- Say goodbye? Now?
No, first I have to come in.
Then I sit down at a table
or at the bar, it doesn't matter which.
I am with a beautiful woman.
I place my order.
A cup of coffee, maybe.
I drink.
I look at her.
I tell her I love her.
She looks at me with a little smile.
She doesn't know me.
She knows that.
But she remembers me
from somewhere. In a way.
She doesn't give me the brush-off
although perhaps she ought to.
She looks at me.
She waits.
The night passes. Until she suddenly
understands that I'm not lying.
I do love her.
There.
Right there is where I say goodbye.
It's time.
Let's take it from the beginning.
It's not so complicated.
There are four people.
Aimee and I, August.
We are married.
Then there's Alex,
the young photographer,
and his beautiful girlfriend,
Simone.
They're not married.
Alex and Aimee are going to meet.
Not yet, but soon.
They're all looking for love,
the dear children.
It can be a bit of a battle.
Let it begin!
- Very nice.
- Very.
Very nice.
It's from Monica. She wants us
to have a drink with her at the bar.
- Did you hear me?
- Yes. Monica asked us out for a drink.
- Now?
- Do you want to?
- You go. I'm tired.
- I thought we could have time together.
- Before I go to Roskilde.
- There's no time ... if Monica ...
- It's only a drink.
- I'll sketch a bit. I don't mind.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Listen ...
I've nearly finished my story.
I know how they'll meet.
- Good.
- I'll tell you tomorrow ... Sure?
- I love you.
- I love you.
- Are you taking your suitcase?
- No, I've got all I need in here.
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.
- How are things?
- What do you mean?
I mean at home. Life. Love.
Isn't that what people usually talk about?
Things are going fine.
- How about you?
- Great.
- That's great.
- Yes, really great.
What would make you
really, really glad?
- Glad?
- Yes. Almost happy?
What would make me almost happy?
I don't know.
- If I did, I'd do it.
- You would?
- Yes.
- No matter what it took?
Yes. No matter what it took.
I dreamed the other day that I had
another girlfriend than Simone.
It wasn't because she was
particularly good looking.
Oh, she had soft skin
and small breasts, but she was ...
... stupidly fragile.
And weirdly enough,
this dread came over me
that I'd hurt her.
I woke up in a panic.
Had I hurt her?
It's true. I was completely ...
I've never been so scared
of hurting another person.
I felt more responsible for her
than I've ever felt for Simone.
Right then ... take care now, OK?
- Take care.
- You, too. Give Nan my love.
Will do.
Give Simone mine.
- Will you be cross?
- About what?
If I go now?
I know dad wants to go drinking.
But I've got a thousand
things to do tomorrow.
- You're going?
- Yes. Make me an excuse.
He won't accept a "no" from me.
- What shall I say?
- That I've a meeting. A deadline.
- A deadline?
- Or something.
Do stay a bit longer.
After all, you never see him.
- I don't want to.
- You know he loves being with you.
- I don't think so.
- Of course he does!
- I don't feel like it.
- What about us then?
- Could we got out?
- Yes, of course.
- You'd do that?
- I'd like to.
I'd wait for you at the station.
We'll go out for a drink. OK?
See you at the station.
Darling ...
... you're suffocating me!
You're suffocating me!
- Quickly! Before he comes!
- See you.
- Very stylish.
- It was most kind of you.
- Shall we move on? Where is he?
- He had to go.
- He said he was really sorry.
- Does he always just leave?
No. But you know what he's like.
Dedicated to his work.
- How do you feel about that?
- Alex is ...
- He is very sweet.
- Sweet?
Do you love him?
Yes.
Does he love you?
Do you love me?
Yes.
Why don't you ever say so?
What?
I do say so!
Only when I ask.
Never by yourself.
I love you.
Yes.
Goodbye Simone.
- It was nice while it lasted.
- It was.
Bye!
Alex!
- Are you OK?
- Yes.
- I'm OK.
- Sweetheart ...
- How did things go with dad?
- You are a bit of an idiot.
I know, I know.
- Let me get a paper.
- What for?
- Would you like a light?
- No.
- Did you find any?
- No ... No.
I love you.
I hope you know.
I have to go.
- Coming?
- What?
To Rome?
The plane leaves shortly.
- To Rome?
- Yes.
Sorry.
Oh.
- What do you want?
- Pardon?
- What would you like?
- A coffee, please.
Only coffee? You're not hungry?
Two coffees.
Thanks. Why Rome?
Why Rome, exactly?
Because I think it sounds right.
Don't you?
You're beautiful,
if I may say so.
You may.
- Alex.
- Aimee.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Who are you?
- What?
Who are you?
-Have you already forgotten?
- Pardon?
Have you already forgotten?
Already forgotten?
Oh, no, of course not.
- Sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
- You're you, and ...
- So you remember me?
But you're still late.
- Late?
- Five minutes.
- No, no, no, no ...
- We said 11 o'clock.
Oh, OK. I didn't know it was this late.
I'm really sorry.
That's OK.
You're here now.
- And you don't have to go?
- No, I'm going nowhere.
And you brought your photos?
- No.
- You've forgotten them, too?
- Just what have you remembered?
- I've got some right here.
- See?
- Nice.
- What is it?
- A woman with three choices.
To stay where she is.
To make the leap ... or ...
Or?
She's the only one who knows.
- What do you think?
- We'll see what happens.
- You haven't decided yet?
- Not yet. Give me some time.
Surely that's allowed?
Time to think?
It's an important decision,
after all.
Yes it is, after all.
And you should never trust a man
with a camera.
So I must be extra careful.
- Can I trust you?
- Of course.
Promise?
Why me?
Because if I am your dream ...
... you are mine.
Aimee is standing at the door
Chapter I
... something floating ...
Hi. Good morning.
- What are you going to do now?
- Have a shower.
You are sweet.
But you have to go soon.
Yes. Oh? How soon?
- Very soon.
- Very soon? Oh.
Is that it, then?
You think so?
- No.
- Good.
Hey! Whoa!
What do we do now?
Think of something.
"Think of something"?
Thank you.
- Got a light?
- Yes.
No, I'm sorry, I just gave
my lighter away. Sorry.
Aimee? Hi!
Aimee.
See you at 1 P.M.
- Aimee?
- Hi!
Back already?
How nice!
- How did it go?
- Just fine.
Hungry? Shall I order
some breakfast?
- What did you say?
- Yes, please.
- What did you do last night?
- Sketched. Had an early night.
- Can I see them?
- Now?
No, later. I think I've got to grips
with my novel. I know his problem.
- That's great!
- What are your plans for today?
I don't know.
Go for a walk.
Room 1235.
What would you like?
- I'd like everything.
- Everything?
Yes, breakfast.
Everything.
- I'll get dressed.
- Thank you.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I'm sorry, Mrs Banum!
Do you need some help?
- Oh, no, why?
- If they're too heavy ...
No, as you see,
I am doing splendidly.
That's fine, then.
- Who is it?
- Alex.
- Who?
- Alex from upstairs.
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
These doors weren't made
for talking through.
- Who are you, did you say?
- It's me. Alex.
I just wanted to say
that I can't get in.
Into my flat. It's kind of ...
Are they rebuilding or something?
- Rebuilding? Just what do you want?
- What do I want?
I can't get into my flat.
There isn't a door.
Perhaps it's my fault.
But I don't understand.
It's very confusing for me as well.
- There's kind of no door up there.
- Up where?
In my flat.
Your flat? What flat?
Mrs Banum,
I live just up the stairs!
In the loft? Who on earth has given you
permission for that?
Did Simone put you up to this?
- Who?
- Simone, my girlfriend.
For goodness' sake!
If you'll excuse me ...
I'm having people for lunch.
- Goodbye.
- It's just that ...
Perhaps we should leave today.
I don't feel quite well.
I don't feel like anymore lectures.
I think I'll cancel.
- Really? Can you?
- Yes, of course I can.
I thought it was a big event.
It is. But if I don't want to,
I don't want to.
Don't you want to leave?
Spend more time together?
After all, we never talk.
Do you mean it?
Yes, I mean it.
Why now,
all of a sudden?
Because I want to be with you.
- Isn't that enough?
- Of course.
Yes, hello?
No, not right now.
But ...
We've already talked about that.
I've told you twice.
No, but ...
I'll come on down.
Bye.
Was that Monica?
I'll go and talk to her.
- And then we'll leave.
- Yes, we will.
Just a second.
Hi, Leo. Have you got
100 kroner to pay off my taxi?
I didn't bring any money.
Are you on your own,
or is Nan there?
She's in the living room.
Yes, of course.
Come on in.
- Hi there!
- Hi!
Having a drink, eh?
- Are you OK?
-Yes, we're just playing.
My door has vanished.
I've got no door.
- Oh?
- Have you talked to Simone?
- No?
- The craziest thing's happened.
It's such a crazy story.
When I got home ...
I can't find my wallet, Darling.
Have you any cash?
Shall I take Mercedes
so you can talk to your friend?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name?
