Long life to Your Imperial Majesty.
The two lions have arrived
in the courtyard.
They are here to perform
for the dowager empress.
Long life to Your Majesty.
Her Imperial Majesty,
the dowager empress.
May the dowager empress
live forever!
Long life to Her Imperial Majesty!
Her Imperial Majesty,
the dowager empress approaches!
May the dowager empress
live forever!
Long life to Her Imperial Majesty!
Your Majesty,
that contraption is called a camera.
Camera?!
These foreigners
and their strange ways!
They come to China and praise us
for our great naval power
and the very next moment they proceed
to sink all our war ships.
Hung chang, is it possible these
young lions could be made use of
to drive out the foreigners?
Your Majesty,
our country has been host to an ever
increasing number of foreigners
all of whom have designs
upon your lands.
And I think the best way of
defeating their plans
would be to set foreigner
against foreigner.
If they start quarrelling
we'll take advantage of the situation
and drive them out
of the country forever.
However, for that to happen, we must
encourage the practice of kung fu.
By organising demonstrations
such as this.
we can provide entertainment
for the masses
and show the foreigners
how strong our country is!
Yes, that's a good idea.
Hung chang
Let's organize a grand competition
for the title of Lion King.
Beijing Railway Station
Get your buns here!
They're hot and fresh!
That bloody train
took so long I'm exhausted!
Hey! Don't push our lion head!
I'm sorry.
Master, Beijing is
much busier than Canton.
Foon, there are all kinds
of people here, so behave.
Excuse me.
Even the foreigners here
can speak Chinese.
The world is changing!
I think we should learn
foreign languages,
so we can communicate
with the foreigners more easily.
I can speak a foreign language.
Really?
Beautiful!
Beau tofu? What does it mean?
I don't know, but some men said it
when they saw 13th Aunt,
so it must be a greeting.
Is that so?
Where is 13th Aunt?
We got off the train together,
didn't we?
We've lost her!
13th Aunt!
13th Aunt!
It's a Chinese lady dressed as a foreigner.
Excuse me.
Master, I found 13th Aunt. This way!
13th Aunt.
Foon, Fei hung.
I'd like you to meet someone.
This is my Russian friend.
I know him when I was in England.
Mr. Tomansky.
Hello.
Hello.
This is Wong Fei hung, and this is
his disciple Leung Foon.
"Beautiful"! "Beautiful"!
You are very interesting!
I see you speak English.
Are they in the theatre?
What?
I'd no idea
you could speak Chinese so well.
I'm an interpreter, so I have to.
Look, it's some foreign women
dressed as Chinese ladies.
Thanks very much for teaching me
my first Chinese sentence.
You know, it's your fault
I fell in love with China.
In fact you are the reason
I decided to come out here.
I think about you every day.
I hope you're not married yet.
What?
I see you still have the camera
I gave you.
I hope you still think about me.
I can't believe my luck
finding you here like this.
It must be fate, right?
"Beautiful"?
What's up with you?
Go on, find a rickshaw.
No need to shout.
Mr. Wong, I have a carriage, it would
be my pleasure to share it with you.
I couldn't take advantage
of our chance meeting.
Fate demands that we part.
Let's go.
That's not very sanitary.
We Chinese don't like
to be touched like that.
Is he your boyfriend?
I'm more than just a boyfriend,
I'm her relative.
Aren't I, 13th Aunt?
You mean you two are really cousins?
It may not mean a lot
to you foreigners
but here,
cousins are extremely close.
Some day you may find out how close.
Come on.
Fei hung, what's got into you?
I had good temper to him.
That camera, was it from him?
Yes, I learnt photography from him.
Fei hung!
Stop calling me 13th Aunt or you'll
never learn to call me anything else.
Use my first name.
Your first name is...
Pe... Peony.
Where's Foon? Where's he gone?
Get him!
Get him!
He's causing trouble again.
Watch out!
Watch this hand!
And watch this foot!
My camera!
Watch your back!
Watch the fist.
Watch the kick!
Watch the leg!
And watch the...
Now then, what seems
to be the problem?
Problem?
He's taken three rickshaws
that's what the problem is.
I see.
We'll let you have them back.
Foon?
Yes.
Unload those three rickshaws.
Right.
And apologies.
Right.
Sorry.
Ah, my leg!
Are you hurt?
No. I'm fine.
Know what you need?
Watch the leg.
Not again!
"The Cantonese Consulate"
It's a flush!
That makes 16 rounds in total!
Is it really 16 rounds?
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine...
It's amazing!
How poor am I!
"The All Powerful Cantonese Lions"
Can you hear it?
Master Wong!
Hi.
Master Wong Kei ying!
Hello, how Are you?
Hello, Master Wong.
Oh, it's Wong.
Kin chon!
How's your business in Hong Kong?
I hear your son's coming to visit.
Yes. He's coming
to see my new medicine factory.
I'm playing mahjong, see you later.
Sure!
Who won the last game?
Look!
Master.
Don't you remember?
The contour here is not round enough.
See the cheeks.
And the winkles!
This must be the
"Kwan Wan Cheung Lion"!
Do you see what I mean?
Uncle, Master Wong, they're coming.
Your son's arrived.
He's here?
No, it's a bunch of hooligans
looking for a fight.
What's that? We're an association.
not a martial arts' club.
What could they want with us?
Stop your game!
Stop your game, you got that?
Pull down the lion heads.
Listen up!
Now listen carefully.
I say it like it is,
my name's Chiu Tim ba.
I've met with all the martial arts'
clubs in the district.
We agree I should represent
the district
at the Lion King Competition.
Therefore only the men from the
Tai ping oil factory may take part.
That means you can forget
all of these preparations.
If you enter the competition,
it's the end of your association.
If you enter the competition
against my advice
this could turn into
a school for cripples.
I hope I've made everything
quite clear.
You are not holding the competition.
How can you set rules for it?!
So you'd prefer a competition
with no rules then?
OK, we'll thrash your place.
Come on!
You old fool, I'll slap your face!
Young boy, I'll teach you a lesson.
Help Uncle out here.
Yes, sir!
What is it? Shit!
Iron Foot!
Yes, boss.
Step aside, don't get too close.
Out of my way!
I'll kill him!
You're all useless!
I'm the head rickshaw puller
Iron Foot!
Now it's my turn.
Master! Master!
Stand back. Move!
The ancestral lion.
Master!
Stand back!
Amazing!
Wonder Kick!
Iron Foot, you're a dead man!
Get him!
Good work!
Smash the lions!
Here we are, home at last.
13th Aunt, be careful.
Go on, get out of here!
What are you staring at?
Hey, watch it!
13th Aunt, it's just over there.
Please take this, the lion head...
Tidy up.
Fei hung, what the...?
Something's wrong.
Master Wong, are you hurt?
I'm all right.
Dad!
Fei hung, you're here!
What happened?
It's nothing really.
There was a fight.
I'll be fine in a moment.
Were they causing trouble?
Did you report it?
Who is this foreign woman?
That's 13th Aunt.
13th Aunt?
She looks so funny!
Dad...
Stop laughing,
it's making you cough.
OK, I'll stop.
Dad!
You can stop laughing now.
I've changed my dress, all right?
Stop laughing!
All right, I'll stop laughing,
Uncle Wong, Fei hung came
to see your new factory.
But he also wanted to talk about
getting married.
Fei hung wants to get married?
Do you know who my future
daughter in law is?
I think he ought to tell you himself.
That rascal! Why on earth
didn't he bring her to meet me?
Foon. I chose two
long sharp weapons for you.
Thanks a lot.
I'll teach you to defend yourselves.
Good...
Why won't Master Wong
let us get revenge?
He's strange like that.
He won't let us start a fight.
He says kung fu's for the health,
but when there's a fight,
he's the first to jump in.
And he always enjoys the fight,
much more than we do.
you ready?
Ready!
Come on!
Right.
Foon, were you planning
on going somewhere?
Master...
It's just that the boys here said
as it's my first time here
they'd take me out to eat ah...
some... prawn dumplings.
Really?
Are the prawns as eager as you?
Yeah, yeah.
You just had dinner.
Why do you want to eat prawns?
Since when did you eat so much?
Come over here, all of you.
All right, sit down.
Go on.
Foon, you too.
I sat all day on the train yesterday.
I'd rather stand, if you don't mind.
We're always blamed by our Government
for forming schools which
they say disturb the public order.
That's why we must be careful.
We must inform the authorities
of any disputes.
We mustn't become involved.
We have to look after the association
and not let them cause trouble again.
Foon!
Yes.
Look at them, they're slouching
all over the place.
You must teach them correct posture.
What? Me?!
But it's so difficult.
Fists in!
Knees out!
Breathe!
Bend!
Stop hitting me!
and you'll copy it out.
Who chose these weapons for me?
Fei hung.
Your father knows
you're hiding something.
Why don't you go
and talk to him? Go on.
Dad, I made you some herbal tea.
Let me help you get up.
I want to talk to you, son.
Drink it.
Thanks, but I don't want any.
What? You don't want it?
I know it's really troublesome.
Here, look at this.
It's a new preparation
from my Bo Chi Lam medicine factory.
It's wonderful for cleaning out
the system.
It could even save a person's life
in an emergency.
I don't need herbal tea any more.
I see.
There are so many quacks around
these days.
If we can produce this
in large quantities
I'm sure people will buy it,
don't you think?
Yeah...
How am I going to get out
of this one?
I've even bought a steam engine
to ensure output.
I'm not feeling very well these days.
You can go to the factory
to see it for yourself tomorrow.
You'll look after it for me, right?
Yeah, right.
The herbal tea, son.
What are you doing?
You're not drinking it.
I didn't want to waste it.
Son, you came back this time to tell
me something important, didn't you?
Did I?
Well, don't you know
your own mind?
Go on, tell me
what you have to tell me.
Nothing!
What? Nothing?
I must let this tea cool down.
It's too hot.
You stupid idiot.
"Bo Chi Lam Medicine Factory"
This thing looks like a train.
So this is the mighty steam engine?
Yes. British industry is ahead of
the rest of the world's economy
all due to Mr. Watt's invention
the steam engine.
You mean a guy
called "What" invented this?!
What industry? What economy?
Master Wong, welcome.
And it's just the steam
that drives everything?
It's that powerful?
Sure, but other things are
as powerful, like my emotions.
When I'm worked up I can move faster
than any steam engine.
Yes, all that movement
at the window confused me.
I was so busy watching you,
I forgot what I was going to say.
What good is a steam engine
that doesn't move?
That's the whole point of it, right?
It's a steam engine.
We're not talking about that.
You're not?
Goodness, you'd better bring
some of our new medicine here.
Look at his face.
it's been scalded by the steam engine.
No, I'm fine, I'm all right.
He wasn't scalded by this steam.
It was another engine last night.
That was quick. You've never
been that quick at your kung fu.
Calm down.
Hey, everyone,
there's another fight outside.
Those martial artists have
come to pick on us again.
The Pak Mai School
The Chiu School
What's this all about?
The Lion King Competition, what else?
The Tam School
The Chiu School
The Pak Mai School
If this carries on.
Someone will get hurt.
They already have been.
This is their third fight.
I'm going to put a stop to it.
Master, wait!
Can he handle them all by himself?
I don't know. I become very anxious
every time he gets involved.
Go and find some men
to help him, hurry up!
Fools!
Drop your weapons. Stop fighting!
You're disturbing the peace.
Stop fighting!
Who is in charge?
I want to speak to your leader.
I see, the Tam
and the Chiu schools...
and the Pak Mai school.
You're all martial artists.
What brings you here causing trouble?
Who are you?
My name is Wong Fei hung.
I ask you honestly, can't you settle
your differences without fighting?
The Tams and Chius
have joined forces against us.
They needed more pupils for
the competition
so they stole mine.
We should classify the grade
of kung fu through fighting
The pupils know
who teaches better kung fu.
Those who came, came willingly.
They weren't forced.
You're from the Chiu, so get lost.
To hell with you!
We are the Tams!
Go on, then, show us!
I'm not afraid of you.
Calm down, please, gentlemen.
Might I suggest you fight me instead?
We'll see who gives
the best performance.
Are you on their side
or on mine? Well?
I just want to be fair. Please.
Him first.
Let's see how good he is!
Right. I'll go first.
Come on!
Master!
Master Wong, thank you.
Sorry about that kick.
That was quick!
All right, my turn.
We risk being ridiculed here.
Master Wong,
we cede to your greater wisdom.
I'm glad to see I've made you realise
fighting's useless.
I'd like to invite you all
to dinner tonight.
I'll be there on time.
So will I.
"San Shiu Restaurant"
Hey, look, it's Master Wong.
Master Wong...
Good evening, good evening.
Please, sit.
Thank you.
Master Lee, I'm so glad
you're here tonight.
What is it?
What on earth are you doing here?
I just wondered
why these broken heads were here.
These lion heads
were used by our ancestors.
Although they're broken now,
we can't bear to throw them away.
I was told that our ancestors won
a lot of competitions in the past.
That's right.
They risked their lives for
each of these heads you see here.
But it was only
for the glory of it all.
This Lion King Competition
is causing a lot of trouble.
I think we should
notify the authorities.
We could tell them,
but I don't think
they could do anything to stop it.
It's been organised by governor Li
on behalf of the empress.
So what?
We could present a petition signed by
all the kung fu schools.
We'll tell her the truth
about what's happening.
What do you think?
I haven't really thought of that.
It doesn't seem right.
This is urgent.
We have to take action quickly.
Mr. Wai, some paper.
Yes, sir.
Thanks for coming here.
May all our schools work side by side
to promote martial arts
and let's present our petition
to governor Li together.
Yes, right.
Cheers.
"Wu Gate"
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
A petition for the governor
signed by the city's 14 kung fu schools.
Sir.
I'll see that he gets it.
Thank you, sir.
Governor Li.
Master Wong represents
the city's 14 martial arts schools.
I have more important things to do.
Give it to one of my secretaries.
Yes, of course, sir.
As if I had time for such trifles.
Sir?
It takes time to process an enquiry,
you won't get an immediate response.
Thanks very much.
It's a pleasure.
Goodbye, sir.
Let's go!
So when will we get a reply?
We just have to wait until it
comes... if it ever does come.
I have to do something.
Master, a rickshaw?
Here you go. Where to?
The Cantonese Consulate.
Come on.
Here, Master, get in. Where to?
Follow that rickshaw.
You're Cantonese?
Yes.
Hey! You're not following
the rickshaw.
Fei hung!
13th Aunt!
Iron Foot! Come on!
Fei hung!
I'm here!
Wong Fei hung!
Cut him off at the East Gate!
Fei hung, Fei hung!
Come out, Wong Fei hung!
Don't hide like a coward!
Wong Fei hung!
I'm not Wong Fei hung!
Wong Fei hung is right here!
Let me go!
Watch out! The woman!
Get out of the way! Move it! Move!
So you're Wong Fei hung?
Master!
I say it like it is,
my name is Chiu Tim ba.
Judging by the way you fought
Iron Foot, your kung fu's excellent.
I could use you
in the Lion King Competition.
That's if you're willing
to join my Tai ping lion team.
Name your price.
I'm a generous employer.
Competing for money alone
is no competition at all.
If you want fighters,
you look elsewhere.
As for your competition,
I'll never enter.
In that case, as you're not my ally,
you're my enemy!
If you refuse to join the Tai ping,
you shall die.
Go to hell!
Master!
Let me go!
My horse!
Hurry up, come and help her!
Tomansky! Please, can you help us?
We're being attacked.
Don't worry.
Surround him!
You want to escape?
Out of my way!
Wong Fei hung,
so you're afraid of me.
Iron Foot!
Don't worry, I'm here.
Be careful!
I'm just in time.
Stop, I know him.
I'm very sorry, but it's not
our custom to kiss a man's hand.
You needn't worry.
It's not our custom
to let our hands be kissed.
You've kissed both of our hands.
but I'll ask you not to do it again.
It's a disgusting habit. Understood?
Iron Foot, well done!
He was kicked!
He's really no good at all!
Bravo!
Fei hung, did that man kick you?
It was no big deal.
I was more worried about your hand...
which has been taken
advantage by others
Don't be ridiculous.
Mr. Wong, why don't you forget
the rickshaws and take my carriage?
We'll be back. Just you wait!
Be careful...
That's very kind,
but we can make our own way.
No, for safety's sake it would
be best to take the carriage.
Come on.
Excuse me.
Aren't you coming?
No. I'll walk.
Driver, the Cantonese consulate.
Go on!
Fei hung!
Sir, your carriage waits.
Please.
Follow that carriage.
We've been here all day.
It's taking too long.
Master Wong!
Master, you're back!
13th Aunt's making a movie.
Master Wong!
She wanted to film you,
but they couldn't wait
so we started without you.
It's really funny.
Old Master Wong's in it too.
But she can't film everybody,
so she chose the seniors.
Do you feel better now?
I need more rest.
Moving pictures?
That's right.
It's not like photographs,
it takes motion pictures.
Motion pictures?!
See?
Master, why don't you try it?
Do I have to?
Fei hung, you'll love it
when people watch your film.
Go on. Master.
Go on.
We can learn kung fu from your films.
No, you're too close to the camera.
Move back, I can't get all of you.
That's fine.
The pictures will move?
Yes!
Right. Ready?
What?
Didn't you hear, action?!
That's what they say before filming.
Then?
Action means you start moving.
It means she's started filming.
You're not like this normally.
You always have quick reactions!
We want some action. Go on.
I know exactly what to do, thank you.
Why do I bother?
The camera's rolling now. Action!
Where did you get that?
We've only just arrived. You couldn't
have ordered it in such a short time.
The Russian you met in the railway
station had it delivered here.
What?
Master Wong!
Fei hung! He wasn't asking you!
What's he up to?
Fei hung?
Are you angry with me?
I've repaired your jacket.
Are you really that angry with me?
I know you don't like Tomansky.
But I never saw a camera before.
I wanted to see what films are like.
They may be very important in future.
We have to learn about new things
in case we need to use them one day.
So everything new is useful,
you make me sound old fashioned.
Please don't be like this.
If you really don't like that Russian,
I'll never see him again.
Are you still angry with me now?
Are you still angry?
13th Au...
No, I mean Peony.
For the wedding arrangements,
you should talk to your father.
We shouldn't waste time.
I'll talk to him.
But I have to think of a good way
of telling him
so he'll be pleased.
Or you'll say I'm an idiot.
Master, Are you still angry?
Son, hurry up!
Others want to be filmed...
Old Master, look!
Master!
Why were you sitting so close?
13th Aunt had something in her eye,
I was taking it out.
Really? 13th Aunt, I'm an expert,
I'll take it out for you.
No thanks, it's done already.
Dad, let's go finish the movie.
Good idea.
Cut that out!
Master! I think
there's something in my eye.
Could you get it out for me?
I don't have time!
Why has everyone got something
in their eyes?
13th Aunt.
we need you for the camera.
Master Wong, this is a good position.
All the lions pass by here.
You can also see the trophy here.
It's a specially designed trophy.
Really?
Yes...
Those lion heads
are different to the usual.
Yes, before the Lion King
Competition starts
they're settling a few old scores.
The four main triads in the city
the White Lotus.
the Tiger gang,
the Black Dragons
and the Tai ping oil factory
they want to put the others
out of the running.
So when the competition comes around,
their rivals can't compete with them.
They seem to have a lot of support.
Yes, this gang here
belongs to Chiu Tim ba.
They seem very sure of themselves.
Here they come!
Here they come!
It looks like a lion race.
but it's just a big fight.
Be careful.
The steam engine's very hot.
Your Master was scalded.
It doesn't look hot.
It's so hot.
you can cook your food on it.
That's just what I'm going to do.
These youngsters never listen.
Let's cook some food, shall we?
Brother Foon, we need your help
in the Lion Race.
Really?
Yeah.
Brother. Come on.
Hurry!
Be quiet!
If Master Wong finds out it's me...
Thunderhead, he won't know
it's me under there!
All right, let's do it!
Come on!
Come over?
Him again!
I didn't invite him.
but he wants to come over.
Since he's here.
we'll give him back his camera.
I'll buy another one.
But they're not easy to find here.
Are you sure?
We'll find one soon.
Where have they put the trophy?
It's about four blocks down.
Really?!
No wonder I can't see it now!
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Hurry, we're still a long way away.
Foon!
What's up?
We'll never catch them.
So we should just give up?
Where is your courage?
Come on!
Let me see where the trophy is.
It's Iron Foot.
Are you sure?
Yes, see that lion with the knives?
Brother Foon, he's very cocky.
Right, we can't win,
but we can stop him.
Yeah. Let's take the short cut.
Iron Foot, take that!
What's up?
Nothing.
Cut it out!
And another kick!
What are you doing?
He kicked me!
Look out! He's coming!
Go to hell!
I'll break your lion head.
Where did Iron Foot go?
He's right behind us. This way!
You're not the lion head.
You're even quicker than me!
It's coming near.
It's coming up here! Run!
Fei hung, look there.
Peony, come on.
Don't use his ladder, this way.
Hold on tight.
Are you quite sure?
All Right.
My camera!
Are you all right?
Get my camera.
Of course.
We still have to return it.
It's Wong, go get rid of him.
Get him!
Right!
Damn you! Who the hell are you?
Yan!
Forget about me, get out of here!
OK.
Bastard, I'm going to kill you.
Who the hell are you?
Come out!
Iron Foot, you can call me Daddy.
Iron Foot be a good boy now,
Daddy said so.
Go to hell!
You can't do this! I'm your dad!
Take that. Dad!
You son of a bitch!
I've got it! I've got it!
We've won the competition!
Stupid idiot! Get that trophy!
Get it back!
Come on, get it back!
I've got it! The Tai ping
have won the competition.
Here. Master.
The winners!
The Tai ping Team
Good! The Tai ping team
is the greatest of them all!
We'll celebrate with a big banquet.
And I'll be giving you all a reward
for proving your loyalty to me!
Loser!
13th Aunt?
My camera.
Peony!
Fei hung!
Why are you so scared?
Something strange is going on.
Did you see something?
Whatever it was. I missed it.
Fortunately we found out just in time
that he was a double agent.
There was no other choice.
We had to get rid of him.
He planned to reveal the plans we
made for the Lion King Competition.
Governor Li Hung chang is planning to
cede Liaodong Peninsula to Japan.
If this happens, war between Russia
and Japan will be unavoidable.
In one month, governor Li will be
preparing to sign the agreement.
To prevent this,
we have to get rid of the governor.
Listen carefully,
this word is wo man.
Wo what?
Wu mung.
Just think of mung beans.
What does it mean?
This word is difficult to pronounce.
I'll teach you a simple one Man.
Me.
Me?
That sounds like the word me.
Why are you teaching me that?
You don't understand.
This is female, this is male.
So it's woman and man.
It's bothering, man... woman...
Teach me something useful,
something I can say in an emergency.
In an emergency?
All right,
here's something for an emergency.
Help!
That's not helpful.
You never know.
Come on, I've never called for help.
It's not a useful word for me.
Teach me something
I can use every day.
All right.
I love you.
I love you?
What does it mean?
You say it when I come to visit you
or when I'm leaving.
I guess it could be useful.
I love you.
Once more.
I love you.
And with my name.
13th Aunt, I love you.
Without the 13th Aunt.
Peony, I love you.
I love you, too.
Why do you say it like that?
It's just an exercise.
Once more, I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Foreigners are really strange,
they seem to use some words
over and over again.
They must like the word love a lot.
I love you.
Peony, I love you.
13th Aunt!
Master. I need to talk to 13th Aunt.
Of course, but when you greet someone
you have to say I love you.
What?
Just repeat after me,
I love you.
This is English. Go on.
13th Aunt.
That sentence was for your master,
you can't use it on me, understood?
Fei hung, I'd like to talk to you.
Would you come outside with me?
Dad, when you come to see me,
you have to say I love you.
Come again?
I love you.
I love you.
Right!
13th Aunt, excuse me,
we need to talk.
We can do some more later.
Come on, let's go out.
I'm thinking of making
some tablets...
13th Aunt, I love you.
Be quiet!
The tablets!
There's something I want
to talk to you about too, Dad.
Could you do me a favour?
What is it?
The steam engine's broken down.
Can you find someone to fix it?
Why don't you tell the old master?
He bought it.
He can get it repaired.
I can't do that!
If the old master finds out
he'll tell my master.
If my master knows that, I...
I'll try and find someone, OK?
It has to be quick.
Dad, there's something
I need to tell you.
Sure, why don't we sit down.
What is it?
Well...
Well, I want to get...
Don't worry. 13th Aunt's
told me all about your plans.
She told you?
And it's all right.
We both agree with your decision.
I'm sure you've made
the right decision.
I was so afraid to tell you.
Why be afraid?
Getting married
is a normal thing for a man.
Then I'll make arrangements.
Good. You do that.
Fei hung, tell me, what's the name
of the bride to be?
13th Aunt.
Are you all right?
Dad. Dad!
Dad, are you all right?
So what other tablets
did you want to produce?
Tablets...
I'll get you a cup of tea
to calm you down.
Fei hung, Fei hung, I love you.
It's 13th Aunt.
That means Fei hung
will be my nephew in law.
What a mess we're in.
What mess?
I was told that Iron Foot's injury
couldn't be cured.
Excuse me.
Wait, wait, give me that!
If he's of no use any more,
then he can take off, it's that simple.
Go on, it's your turn!
Master Chiu, it's your turn.
Yes! I know it's my turn, you idiots.
Come on, guys,
Master Chiu will take care of you.
Come and earn some money.
Who the hell are you? Piss off!
Let's see you block my kick now,
Iron Foot!
Damn! Another one
of these useless counters!
Where's your Wonder Kick now?
Come on.
You're not like this normally,
where's your courage?
Do you need a hand?
Wait a sec. I've won!
May I help you?
Go to hell!
You're too slow.
I need to make money, come on!
Damn you cripple!
I win again!
Can't you get up?
I'll get your reward for you.
Be careful. Can you see all right?
I think it's all right now, yeah?
That should do it.
Take this.
Thanks.
It just needs a few taps here.
Fei hung?
I thought you promised me
you'd never see him again.
I needed his help
to repair the steam engine.
So it's broken. I don't care!
Wong Fei hung!
Master!
Your views are old fashioned.
You shouldn't underestimate
the steam engine.
It can make your factory
more efficient
and do things
that are impossible for humans.
Steam is the force
behind the industrial revolution.
Whoever can master steam
will be the masters of the world.
The industrialists
will be the new emperors.
Both Russia and China
must adapt to the new ways.
If this is the way forward,
I'll face the reality then.
We'll see if humans or machines
will have the last word.
Fei hung!
He's really angry now.
Fei hung!
13th Aunt!
Fei hung!
Iron Foot?
"The All Powerful Cantonese Lions"
Wong Fei hung?
It's all right.
Are you all right?
13th Aunt!
You ungrateful bastard!
Foon!
Don't touch me!
Iron Foot, your leg is badly injured.
If you don't let me help you,
you'll be crippled for life.
Wong Fei hung, why don't you
save your pity?
Leave me be!
Be careful!
Iron Foot.
Come on, why don't you
let us help you?
Let's go back inside.
You ungrateful bastard!
Go to hell!
Come on. Iron Foot.
Leave me!
Your leg can't get wet.
Look, if you want to fight me,
wait till you're better.
Wong Fei hung!
Glad you could come!
Great to see you!
Lovely to see you, sir.
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
Fei hung, I had no idea
you could move that fast.
That's why they say you can kick
faster than your shadow.
I didn't know I was that fast.
Foon!
Why has it stopped?
It's Brother Foon!
You're right.
It's very quick and confusing.
You OK?
It's on fire!
Can someone put out the fire?
How come it's burning?
Film is highly flammable.
Then you'd better never
use film again.
Out of the way!
Wong Fei hung!
Chiu Tim ba? What does he want?
Don't be scared.
I'm looking for a friend of mine.
I'm going to kill you!
Get the weapons.
I've looked after him for many years,
but now he's here with you
so I've come to take him back.
You're the one that abandoned him.
Foon!
Chiu Tim ba. I'd rather
we were friends than enemies.
I've treated his wound.
if he wants to return, then it's his choice.
You can't say fairer than that.
That's most noble of you.
Wong Fei hung,
I really admire your character.
To prove my goodwill, I'm arranging
a banquet tomorrow night
for you and your father.
Please come.
I just want to say sorry.
Fine, we'd be delighted to attend.
Great, that's what I appreciate in a person,
the ability to forgive.
Tomorrow night, the San Shui Restaurant,
and don't be late.
Thank you, Master.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Master.
And thank you once again.
We'll set an example for the rest
of the kung fu schools.
See you tomorrow night!
See you.
Master.
Iron Foot.
I can't refuse the invitation.
Nobody must leave
the building tonight.
Foon, take care of security.
Security?
I will go to the restaurant,
you take care of this place.
Fei hung, I intend going with you.
Dad...
I'm not going to let you go alone.
Didn't you hear him say
I was invited?
I'm going with you.
We'll go together.
Of course.
When things get tough,
we have to stick together.
Master's leaving now.
Last night was quiet,
but we have to be more careful.
You two, the back door.
you three, the front door.
You two, cover the yard.
You three, take the street.
Iron Foot, you take the roof
and the side gate.
Hey, Foon,
how can I watch both places?
Your leg could do with the exercise.
Oh. I see.
Yan, get some water ready.
But I've had my bath.
Not for bathing, in case of fire!
Oh, right.
Hey, Foon, have you seen Fei hung?
No. I haven't.
He left without me.
Chiu Tim ba, here I am.
Master Wong,
I'm glad you could make it.
You're most welcome.
This way please.
I'm sure you'll like the food
and the young ladies.
Ladies? I don't know about that.
OK, then.
We'll give that a miss.
Please, sit.
Sit...
Master Wong, I know you'll join me
in a toast to peace.
See...
I've prepared
the finest wine for you.
Here's to peace.
I'd also like to offer our respects
to the great martial arts' heroes.
We are merely carrying on
the great traditions they founded.
Cheers.
What's this?
Wong Fei hung,
I invited you and your father,
yet you came alone.
That proves you are not sincere.
What's more
you assaulted one of my men.
You just want to humiliate me.
You attacked my father,
yet I came here tonight
out of respect for you.
We live in a country
where law and order prevails.
So I'm going to turn you in.
Really?
And you honestly think you'll manage
to evade this little trap?
You're a better fighter
than I imagined.
I'm afraid this is your last supper.
Now I'm going to send you to hell!
Go ahead.
I'd like to see you try.
Go on, I'm waiting.
Well, wait no longer.
A simple trick, try this for size!
You won't succeed.
Don't waste any more time.
Get him!
Oil?
Of course!
After all, it is in our factory.
We'll see how good your skills are
when things are slippery underfoot.
Go to hell!
Put the table here.
We can play a little game
and watch the show.
Chop him into little pieces!
Well done!
You don't escape that easy!
Are we having fun yet?
I'm gonna die!
You're still alive.
Master Wong.
Get lost.
Stand firm!
I've lost!
Wong Fei hung!
Chiu Tim ba! Stop!
Fei hung, are you all right?
Fine. Come on.
Where are you going?
Please spare me.
I know I've done wrong,
but please spare me, sir.
I'm begging you.
You should have
thought of that before.
Look out! He knows kung fu.
How dare you are!
I'm going to dig out your eyeballs.
Iron Foot!
Well, it seems your leg's better.
Wong Fei hung, it will take
more than you to stop me.
Your kung fu is very average.
Master, how can you stand this?
Right, get after him.
Right.
But like you say,
we'd better stay calm.
What's that?
13th Aunt's suitcase.
13th Aunt...
13th Aunt's gone. Where did she go?
We must find her.
Gone?
13th Aunt!
Check that side.
Right.
Fei hung.
Aunt...
Peony!
You didn't leave.
Say something. This kind
of behaviour is hardly fitting.
I say that we should throw away
the old lion heads.
They're outdated,
they're no use any more.
Lion heads? I don't get it.
Peony, I thought you'd left forever.
Yes, there's something important
I have to show you.
Follow me.
What did he stuff in the wall?
I went back to that place
and I found this.
At the Lion competition,
when the firecracker explodes
kill Li Hung chang.
I knew that Russian
was up to no good!
We must inform
His Excellency at once.
But he may not want to see us.
Then what?
Are you asking me?
It's a matter of life and death!
Be serious!
We have to save Governor Li.
We must stop the explosion from happening.
Who knows what disorder might follow?
Of course, we can't involve
the association.
To solve this problem,
I shall go in myself.
The camera team. Let them through.
Let's go.
Master, I can't see the trophy.
That's because it's hidden inside
that huge lantern there.
When the governor lights it,
it will rise up.
The lion grabs it and the firecracker
underneath goes off.
You'll have to be careful.
That's when the assassination
is due to happen.
Got that?
Got it. Master.
His Excellency, governor Li.
Sir, the foreigners are saluting you.
Very good.
Your Excellency.
The film.
Give it to me.
Now.
Foon, Iron Foot, let's go!
Climb over the top!
Yes. Master!
Foon! Stand on my shoulders.
You're learning fast.
Iron, look behind you.
Right, let's get moving.
Master, Iron can't keep up with us.
Yes. I can.
Who's that?
Pyramid.
Iron Foot, don't move.
Let's get them.
Kick the head.
Be careful! Head for the tower.
I'm fine, but I'm worried
about Iron Foot.
Watch out for the hammers!
I'm trying to!
Master, did you see that?
Why are you so excited? Be careful!
Master, I've been injured.
Forget about me.
Master, where's Foon?
He's injured.
See if you can help him.
Right. Get out of my way.
Brother Foon!
I'm here, on my back!
On your right. Now your left!
Behind you!
Foon seems to be injured.
Brother Foon!
Hey, Yan!
Don't be an idiot, come back here.
Yan, you forgot to bring
the medicine chest.
Come back here!
The camera is pointed this way.
It could ruin all our plans.
I'll go and check.
Yes.
That Russian's coming.
What will we do?
I'm going.
And me?
Watch things here.
Yeah, right.
Be careful, daughter.
Don't worry, Uncle.
Daughter?!
Why is she still calling me Uncle?
Brother, are you all right?
Sure, go and help Master.
Sure, take care.
Leave the flag here.
He's still not experienced enough.
Peony, why were you
filming us earlier?
What's wrong?
Do you have something to hide?
What exactly do you know?
We both know what's going on here.
Here I come!
Chiu Tim ba!
Wong Fei hung, I'm going to be
the champion.
Get him!
Let's go.
So simple!
We nearly have the trophy. Come on!
Chiu Tim ba, stop dreaming!
Wong Fei hung,
I'm going to devour your lion.
I'll bite you to death!
No way.
Kill him!
Tell them that I want a good fight,
but no killing.
I'll swallow you!
Wong Fei hung, you won't beat me.
Smash the tower!
Master, I'll help you.
Grab the tail.
Iron Foot, we have to stop
the big lion.
OK!
Surround them.
Iron Foot, roll over!
Got it.
Iron Foot, the big lion, let's go!
OK!
Keep them away from our lion!
The tower, come on!
Give me a banner!
Be careful!
Master, what now?
The Russian and 13th Aunt!
There must be something wrong.
Master, here I come!
Master, that lion is trying to
knock down the tower!
Look out! Here comes Chiu himself!
You stupid idiot!
Why didn't you get out of the way?
Master, there's one more!
I'll try to smash the lion head.
Master, let me!
And another one!
Destroy the tower!
That camera was a gift from me.
Now I'm asking you to return it.
Give it back!
A medicine chest?
It was a decoy.
Why did you betray me?
I didn't betray you.
The camera betrayed you
when it filmed you.
Peony, I can't let you go!
Even if you stop me,
your plan cannot succeed any more.
Do you remember what I once told you?
You have to go with the changes.
Years ago, the Hans detested
being ruled by the Manchus.
And now you're used to it.
In 200 years time,
you'll be used to
being ruled by foreigners.
China should be ruled by Chinese.
We have to work out our own problems.
We don't need you foreigners
getting involved.
I'm afraid I'll have to kill you.
13th Aunt!
13th Aunt, don't worry...
Don't move!
Brother Foon, I'll save you!
Go away.
I'll save you.
Cut it out! I'm better at saving.
Don't worry.
Stop arguing.
What now?
Cut the lantern's ribbon.
Damn! This thing isn't steady.
Iron, are you all right?
Master, look, the lantern!
Catch!
Damn it!
Master, you need a lion head.
Quick, give it to me.
I've got it.
Iron Foot, catch.
Right.
Where did it go?
It's stuck up there.
Come on, let's get it.
The firecracker's going to go off
any minute. What do I do?
Bring that back here!
Iron, throw me the lion head!
Yes. Master!
Don't move.
Don't move.
Drop it.
Don't look!
I wish your view of history
had been different
but it's all too late now.
Please stop!
Master Wong, please stop.
If you kill me,
hundreds of workers
at my factory will lose their jobs!
Spare a thought
for all those poor workers.
I've lost everything.
Give me a second chance.
A second chance?! Forget it!
Many people have suffered
because of the likes of you.
Take him away
before I change my mind. Go on!
Master, are you all right?
Apparently the man they shot dead
was a spy working for the Japanese.
This proves what they have long
suspected about the man's identity.
I see now.
We should tell His Excellency.
Thank you, sir.
Iron Foot, the trophy!
Yes!
Your Excellency, the competition
is over. I hope you're satisfied.
But unfortunately,
the lantern was destroyed in the fight.
And we cannot say
just who the winner is.
I have the trophy.
But who is the loser
and who is the winner?
This Lion King Competition
has caused many deaths.
We are all losers.
In life the only ones who win
are the pure of heart
and it's up to us to pass on
that message to all our people.
Only the wisdom
and great courage of our people
can make our country strong again.
How much has this gold trophy
really cost us?
Perhaps Your Excellency
would consider that.
I'll give the trophy to
Your Excellency as a souvenir.
Good bye!
Wong Fei hung?
