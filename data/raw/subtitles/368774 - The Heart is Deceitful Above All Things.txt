Look what mama got you.
Look at the bunny.
Look at the bunny.
Mama.
Right here, honey.
He'll get used to it.
Hang in there, honey.
Thank you.
I am your mama.
This is your new home.
This is your bed, your new bed.
Come and sit on your bed.
Come on.
You want to sit here?
I got you a lot of toys,
like the bunny.
You want the bunny?
I got you a piano.
Do you want to look at a book
while I make dinner?
Well...
You're probably used
to all kinds of fancy toys
at your fosters',
but when we get to know
each other better,
you can tell me
which toys you like,
and I'll go buy them for you.
You're gonna have so much fun
with me, you have no idea.
Look, I made you spaghetti.
No! No!
You will not trash this house!
Fuckin' spoiled brat.
Jack and Jill went up the hill
to fetch a pail of water.
Jack fell down
and broke his crown,
and Jill came tumbling after.

Mommy, I love you!
Please don't leave!
Please don't leave me!
Make it easy on yourself.
He'll be all right.
You might see him again someday.
Mommy, don't leave me!
I love you!
Don't leave me, mommy!
Mommy, I love you!
Yes, it works.
Thank you, operator.
Hello?
Jeremiah, honey, are you awake?
It's your foster parents.
Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy!
Hello? Yes, he's right here.
Please, please, please!
I want to talk to them!
Hand over the phone!
Bad?
Well, he hasn't been very bad.
So you don't want
to speak to him?
Give me the phone!
Hello? Mommy!
Hello? Yes, he did that.
I want to talk to my mother.
Fuck, yeah, I'll tell him.
Y'all take care. Goodbye, now.
Mommy! Daddy!
Mommy.
Mommy. Daddy.
Mommy.
They didn't want to talk to you.
They don't care about you.
I went through a lot
to get you back,
and you better start showing
some gratitude.
You want to know
what they said about you?
Your foster parents.
One shirt, two arms.
One underwear, two legs.
One pants, two legs.
Two socks, two feet.
Thank you, Jesus!
One, two, three, four.
Thank you, Jesus!
One, two, three, four, five.
Thank you, Jesus!
One, two, three, four.
Thank you, Jesus!
One more, y'all.
Give me some power on this one.
Jesus!
I got to hear y'all saying
things if you believe it.
Thank you, Jesus!
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
Jesus!
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
Yes, punch it out.
Good job.
God says if you truly believe,
you can overcome any obstacle.
You're going through
an obstacle right now.
Some of you guys have probably
never worked out before.
You're taking that first step.
Take the words
of Paul seriously,
and why don't you see
what happens?
One, two...
Now lift up. Punch.
Hi.
Here, try this one.
I'll show you how to do it.
Breaker, breaker, come in.
You try.
Breaker, breaker, come in.
Look, you're a sheriff.
Are you ticklish?
Yeah! Yeah.
You're never gonna be able
to change it.
No, I don't think so.
Just send someone out
just as soon as you can.
Over.
Hey, Brent,
the boy's mom is here.
Your mommy's here.
No!
Hi.
What's wrong?
I thought
you wanted to see your mom.
He's just confused.
Thank you so much, officers,
for picking him up.
I thought he was lost.
I looked all over for him.
Fed him some ice cream.
I hope that's okay.
Look at him.
He's a mess.
We didn't know how
to get in touch with you,
so we called social services,
and they gave us your number.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Yeah.
Yeah.
A lot more
than it should have been.
I'll take home to
your mom and dad, all right?
We're late for an appointment.
Bye-bye.
Thank you.
It's bad to smoke.
My mama always says so.
Is that what she said?
There.
Fuck them socials
trying to tell me,
"maybe he's better off
with a foster family."
They wanted to adopt you.
Calling me and my father up,
asking me to sign the papers
so they can take you away
like you're some pound dog
or something,
steal you away forever.
That's not true.
You're not my mommy.
Yes, I am.
You came right from here.
I'm stuck with you,
and you're stuck with me.
Do you understand?
I want my mama!
Take me home!
Take me home to my real mommy!
Please!
Take me home!
Mama!
Enough already.
Take me home.
Okay, let's you and I
have us a little chat.
Let's get this straight, okay?
I am your mother.
All right?
Can't say I wanted you.
Can't say I didn't do
rabbit's tricks
to try and get rid of you.
If my father let me,
you'd long been flushed down
some toilet, you understand?
Of course,
once I squirted you out,
you weren't
his grandson anymore.
He wouldn't pay
for a diaper then.
Not a dime to feed or keep you,
cheap son of a bitch.
They took you away from me,
goddamn social workers.
But now I'm 23 now.
I got you back.
See?
You're mine.
Take me home.
They don't want you.
Take me home!
Is that what you did
at your fosters'?
Did you go crying and throwing
tantrums like a spoiled baby
if you didn't get your way?
That must be why they
didn't want you no more.
That's not true.
Then, tell me, why did
they get rid of you
if they loved you
so goddamn much?
They sure didn't do anything
to stop the social workers
when they came to take you away,
now, did they?
They said you're a bad boy,
and that's why they had
to give you away.
They told those cops
how evil you are.
If I hadn't come in
and rescued you,
they would have taken out
their guns and shot you through.
I got ice cream.
If I hadn't come for you,
you'd be hung up on a cross.
They teach you about Jesus?
If I take you back, the police
are gonna drive
a long nail in here.
Your mama and daddy
will hammer another one here,
and they'll stick one here,
and you'll only die
at the very end.
I want to stay with you.
What?!
I want to stay with you.
Really?
We have only each other
from now on,
just me and you... that's it.
I fought for you,
and I have to fight for me.
I'm all you got.
Come here.
Put your hands around me,
come on.
All right, let's go. Come on.
Here, sweetie.
"A," "b," "c."
What's this?
Your stuff.
Where are we going?
One second.
You sleeping?
Don't be tired.
I need your company.
Here, open that up.
Be careful, be careful.
Take one.
No, no, take one and bite half.
Go on.
Is it medicine?
Yeah, it's medicine.
Do what mama tells you.
Come on.
You got to swallow it.
Did you swallow?
You swallow?
Good, good.
I'll take
another one myself, I reckon.
See now how good we're feeling.
you see, I take care of you.
Telling me I don't.
When I was 15, maybe I didn't
take care of you right,
but then the voices
you were throwing...
You was possessed.
Not tired anymore?
I am your mother.
Damn, you look like
a bug-eyed rabbit.
What are you doing?
I'm digging myself out.
Where's the goddamn car at?
Whoo!
Come on, baby.
Are you gonna drive?
Yeah.
Honey.
Can't you wait
till we get on to your place?
A pretty flower like you.
I don't need you
wilting up on me now.
God damn, who is it?
Me.
Thelma?
Hold on.
There's a little kid here.
What, are you a little boy,
or are you a little girl?
Mama.
I ain't old and haggard
enough to be mama,
except in front
of social workers.
Then I'm mama, got it?
This is my brother, Johnny.
I'm sitting him.
Damn, he been in the car
this whole time?
You are something else, baby.
I know.
Come on, Johnny.
You're sleeping in here.
Come on.
Take off your shoes.
You got to go?
Okay.
Good night.
Johnny... remember?
Monique.
Johnny.
Who are you to be sitting
in judgment of me?
How rude.
You're not one of the posters.
Well, I got news for you.
That's how you got here.
Luther, I can't believe
what happened.
My brother... he fuckin' peed
on your pillows.
He's always pissing.
He pissed on my pillow?
Do you want me
to do something about it?
Johnny, get over here, boy!
Get in here, kid!
One more game
to become our all-time
prize-winning champion.
He's never been spanked
before, Luther.
My parents spoiled him rotten.
There's gonna be a whole lot
more than a spanking
going on here, that's for sure.
The only way your brother's gonna
learn not to piss his pants
is to give him
a whipping he remembers.
Luther, I didn't know you had it
in you to be so fatherly.
Get over there.
Come on, boy.
You ain't listening to me?
Get his things down.
God damn.
He smells like
an alley in the city.
He pisses it, he wears it.
I won't wash it till he learns.
Now, I'm gonna whip you
a beating
you can be proud of, boy.
You ain't gonna be pissing
your pants no more.
You hear me?
You hear what I'm saying?
Goddamn spoiled brat!
I don't want to hear you
hollering, now, come on.
Okay.
Put that sock in his mouth.
No!
Ain't that right, mama?
Make this boy grow up fast?
We're gonna teach him
one way or the other.
He'll grow up right,
just like I did.
We got to go.
So, listen, honey,
we're off to Atlantic city.
Your new daddy's
taking me on a honeymoon.
We'll be back in two days.
I left you some cheese singles
in the fridge
and chips in the cupboard,
and I think there's
some white bread there, too.
Don't forget the boots.
No.
All right, Jeremiah,
look, we're gonna lock the door
from the outside.
You're gonna lock it
from the inside, okay?
Don't answer the door
for nobody.
Keep the volume on the TV down,
and don't answer my phone, okay?
You don't want the police
to come find you, do you?
All right,
will you be all right?
You'll be all right? All right.
Bye.
Bye.
Lock the door.
She ran out on me...
when I run out of money.
That bitch.
I'm sorry about the drawings.
I thought you weren't
coming back no more.
Sarah.
It's okay.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Sorry.
Okay, here we go.
Help us out here, officer,
if you don't mind.
What's your name, son?
Did we find the I.D. In the car?
Son, what's your name?
He needs stitches.
Nurse, let's get
these restraints going.
You'll gonna feel
a sharp stick, okay?
Somebody hold him still.
Son, you about done
with the photos?
Tell us your name.
Nurse, hold him still now.
And one more stick.
Somebody hold him still.
And one last one.
Aaah!
Okay, here we go.
We're gonna fix you right up.
Meredith, 101, Meredith.
Okay.
Right.
See, the little boy's got
blond hair, just like you.
And he's got freckles.
You got
a freckle there, don't you?
This is a bad man.
He's so bad.
Bad man, bad.
Bad man.
Owie!
Owie!
Owie, owie, owie, owie!
Hey.
Hey.
Pay attention.
Watch the dolls.
All right, now, how does
this make the little boy feel?
You know it's not his fault.
You know that.
Now repeat after me.
It's not the little boy's fault.
Come on, you can do it.
Just say it.
Repeat after me.
It's not the little boy's fault.
You know, you got to say it.
Just say it. It's easy, come on.
It's not the little boy's fault.
If you don't say it,
you're gonna have your cartoon
privileges taken away,
and you're gonna have to spend
the whole night alone again.
It's not the little boy's fault.
It's not...
Hey, that's it, come on.
Come on.
Come on, say it.
The little boy's fault.
Good.
See?
It was easy.
It wasn't that hard, was it?
Right.
It's time to go.
Come on.
Hey.
You leave the toys alone.
You can play
with the toys tomorrow.
Jeremiah...
Where have you been all day?
You're going home.
Your grandma's here.
She's obtained custody.
Why don't you two
go to your rooms?
Come on.
Don't you want to go home?
Come on.
You'll come and visit the kids
here again sometime maybe,
or they can come visit you.
Look.
There's your grandma now.
And you're...
Going to West Virginia.
I know that's a long way.
Is that why you haven't visited?
It's a long trip.
God is my salvation
and my glory.
The rock of my strength
and my refuge is in god.
Trust in him at all times.
God is a refuge for us.
Psalms 62:7-8.
This is the house of the lord.
Your mother never taught you
your Bible, did she?
Wait here for your grandfather.
The way of the wicked is
an abomination unto the lord,
but he loveth him who follow
after righteousness.
Do you know
where that's from, Jeremiah?
You will not mock the lord.
You will learn not to mock me.
You will learn these tracts.
Keep this with you always.
That is your pillow, Jeremiah.
Sleep on it.
Do not slouch in my presence
or the presence of the lord.
He sent you to us.
Stand up straight.
And the disciples said to Jesus,
"when will the kingdom
of the father come?"
And Jesus said, "it will not
come by expectation."
"They will not say, 'look here, '
or, 'look there.'
but the kingdom of the
father..."
How old are you?
7 and 10 days.
How old are you?
I know
the psalms one through 70.
How many do you know?
I know a lot of songs.
What?
Damn, you're an idiot.
What songs do you know?
Sing some.
you're possessed.
Jesus Christ.
You got to sing that
for the old man.
He'll love it.
Promise you'll sing it for him.
What's your name?
Aaron.
Do you know Sarah?
Sarah, yeah.
She's one of my older sisters.
She's a sinner.
They had to take her away
to boarding school in Italy,
where mother was born.
Yeah, she was possessed.
She's my mother.
Yeah, I know.
You got to sing it
for him, okay?
We begin
in the morning, Jeremiah.
We begin at 7:00.
Don't do that.
It's worshipping idolatry.
You'll burn in hell.
Make your bed.
Put a towel on.
You got to wash up
before prayer.
The clothes in there...
They should fit you.
They fit me when I was your age.
Let's go!
We got chores to do.
Slap him.
It wasn't me.
I swear on Christ's nails.
Go.
It will be done.
It will be done.
But ye are washed,
but ye are sanctified,
but ye are justified
in the name of the lord Jesus.
Amen.
That wasn't so bad, was it?
You'll get used to it.
How many you done?
This is my fifth.
I've done like 20.
Can't imagine why.
Older, faster.
Hey.
Ha ha, there's one on...
Look what... look what I did.
Look what I did.
Ew!
Aaron.
Come in, Jeremiah.
Close the door.
Take a seat.
No, there.
Yes.
Have you learned psalms,
Jeremiah?
I know songs, sir.
Aaron told me
to sing them for you.
What psalm is that, Jeremiah?
Ax pistons, sir.
Where did you learn
about this psalm?
From stinky.
He's a punk rocker.
He had a mohawk,
but he cut it.
He learned me guitar
to be a punk, too.
But we ran away
because he was boring,
Sarah said.
What else did Aaron say?
He says he gets candy from
your... from your drawer,
and if I do his bed for a week,
I can get me some.
And he said
my mommy is a sinner.
That's about it.
Thank you.
That's all, Jeremiah.
Yeah, that I'm not wearing
any underwears right now.
So Jeremiah is a liar?
Yes, sir.
I'm not!
Aaron, how did Jeremiah know
I kept hard candy in my desk?
Who is the liar, Aaron?
I am, sir.
Well, now.
What should we do?
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
Thank you, sir.
I want to tell you
why Jesus came
and what happened to him.
I want to tell you
how he'll come again.
I want to tell
you people to be ready.
Most of all,
I want to tell you to be ready
so that on the last day,
you will rise
in the glory of the lord.
God's word is a burning word.
It burns man and children,
children and man the same.
It burns you clean.
He must be feeding you
more than he ever fed me.
What do you want?
I've come to take you back.
Don't worry about your grandpa.
He won't fuck with me.
I've got an overhand.
You don't believe in that crap.
Remember how much fun
we had together?
Come on, you're coming with me.
Let's go.
Come on.
Why?
Keep walking.
What?
Why?
I'm your mother.
"Why?"
Come on, get in.
Hey.
Here he is.
This is Kenny, your new daddy.
Hi.
Listen, little man.
You ain't seen
your mama in a while?
But I knew where
to find you, you know?
My father used to send me here,
just like you,
preaching hellfire
and damnation.
You got a mighty fine mama.
Now, I know
you've had some,
religious instruction,
but we all ain't gonna have
none of that up in here.
Unh-unh.
I got my own thing
with the lord,
and if you try to start up
preaching, there's the door,
and don't let it hit you
in the eye.
You understand?
Yeah?
Now, there's a little bed
on back there.
Go on to bed.
Go on back there.
Go on.
Look what mama got you,
Jeremiah.
You ready?
Yeah, let's go.
I hate this town.
whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo!
No. No, this is hurting me.
Your fucking wig's on crooked.
Wait a minute. Let me get this.
Damn.
Sexy hair.
Ha!
Look, check it out.
Wha!
No, no, no, no, no.
Straighten this...
It's not straight?
Pull the front down.
All right. Is it good?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Leave it.
But, look, you know, we're
running a little bit late
since that last weigh station,
plus picking your kid up.
Well, fuck that.
I'll bring in more
than your whole run.
You know that.
Hey!
That's why we stopped, sugar.
You goddamn do it, don't you?
Come here. Come here.
No!
Don't even be messing
my lips up,
unless you want to pay for it.
Listen, I'm gonna be listening
out for you tonight.
Don't mess my...
Hey, I'm gonna be listening out
for you tonight.
You do out there
and get a good job, all right?
Who's your daddy?
All right, later, later.
Knocking shit over in here.
I'll see you later.
Fucking my truck up.
Hey, don't step
on that carpet like that.
Treat it nice.
Shit.
Put good shit on.
Kenny?
Kenny?
No, ma'am. It's me.
Come on back here.
Come here.
Lie down.
You're all I got.
You better not leave me.
I'm yours.
hey, don't put your feet
on the dash there.
God damn it!
Put your feet down.
No. What?
I hate punk rock.
I ain't gonna listen
to that shit.
What? Only faggots
call it punk rock, Kenny.
Yeah.
Hey!
Fuck you!
Why don't you listen to your
fuckin' tapes out there?!
What? Yeah.
What the fuck? My fuckin' tapes!
You piece of shit!
Quit kicking me!
Don't fuckin' hit me again!
Shut up!
Go and get my fuckin' tapes.
You shut your fuckin' mouth.
You and
your fuckin' country shit!
Hey, baby,
the tape's all in there.
I'm sorry. I think I can fix it.
Just put it...
It's... it's not broken.
It's not broken.
Subhumans tape, you fucker.
Look at this.
You listen out for me, now.
I'll see you later.
Jeremiah, get up here.
Now.
I want you to go inside
and get yourself
something to eat
before that snack shop closes.
Okay?
The high today
will reach 75 degrees,
with cooler temperatures
this evening.
The thermostat
drops to around 41 degrees.
Clear skies should continue
through the workweek,
before we see
some thundershowers
moving in on Sunday.
Traffic is
generally looking good.
Congestion on I-40 right
before Henderson boulevard.
We got some crazy
demolition work going on,
starting off at about noon.
Other than that, looking good.
Back to you.
Hey!
Lookin' good, baby.
He left us?
See that truck there,
the orange one?
I'll be in there.
Come by in an hour
and be my sister.
Be Chrissy.
Bring the bags.
All right, folks, put 'em
together out there now.
A big round of applause.
That is
the coal miner's daughter.
all right, folks,
you know the drill.
Freeze!
Wait here, amigo.
Nothing here. Nothing at all.
No prostitutes in here.
All right.
I was fucking arrested.
The fuckin' guy
at the club got us out,
or I'd have turned you in.
Sorry.
I prayed for Jesus
to bring you back.
God is my salvation
and my glory.
He is the rock of my strength.
You got to learn
when to shut the fuck up!
Get the fuck out,
you possessed piece of shit.
Get the fuck out.
Get the fuck out.
Baby.
Daddy's little girl.
Daddy needs his little girl.
Good girl.
Yeah.
And that was our first
competitor, from Germany.
Long form, very passionate
young lady, skating 82.
Come over here.
600 skaters from all 50 states,
ranging in age from 16 to 29.
We got to do
something with your nose.
Somebody fucked their slave,
and you've got
the nose to prove it.
Fix it please.
Camouflage it, see?
I learned that in beauty school.
One day I'll go back.
I'll get a shop for the stars
in Hollywood.
Take me.
Hold still.
All right.
Close your eyes.
Look left.
Look right.
Blink.
Look at me.
Can I come
to Hollywood with you?
Can I come to Hollywood...
Hold still.
You're making me late for work.
I want to leave
before Jackson gets back.
The actual competition
will depend...
Well?
I'm pretty.
See?
I'm gonna tell you,
you were meant to be a girl.
I know.
Stop doing that.
Don't mess my lips.
Sorry.
My hair
used to be blond like yours.
Yours will get darker, too.
We're beautiful girls,
aren't we?
You can't be getting to heaven
shaking the preacher's hand
on the front porch
of the church.
Sitting in the front pew's
not gonna do it.
You can be playing the piano.
You can be singing
in the choir...
You're so beautiful, baby doll.
Thank you, honey.
Daddy's sexy girl.
How's my baby doll's honey pot?
You know you love it, Jackson.
You can do it every night
and still be out there running
around with another man's wife.
That's right...
What in the hell are you doing?
Jesus Christ, Jeremiah,
what's gotten into you?
Did your mother
put you up to this?
Is she home early?
Sarah!
It's me, daddy.
I'm your baby girl.
You do look like your mother
a little bit.
Back in the day... get your
thumb out of your mouth.
You know
you ain't supposed to do that.
There's something wrong
with you, boy.
Lord, help me.
Ain't your little girl "purty"?
You want some of this?
That's enough.
Play with me, please, daddy.
Play with me.
God bless you. Thank you.
You'll break the lamp! No.
Fuck you. Fuck you.
Baby, come on.
Fuck you. Fuck you.
I'm gonna fuckin' get him!
I'm gonna fuckin' kill him!
Leave me alone!
No. Get up.
The stain's not out yet.
I can't hold her forever.
He's always trying
to steal what's mine!
It's all right. The stain's out.
The stain's out, please.
Come on.
It's okay, see? The stain's out.
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!
Go! Go on!
I'm gonna kill you!
Come on.
My baby doll.
He stole my baby doll.
I fuckin' hate him.
Where are you going?
I'm getting
the fuck out of here.
Fucking queers.
Baby, I'm sorry.
Come on, baby doll,
please come on.
I said I was sorry.
Come here, baby.
You can't leave me now.
You make me sick!
You... you understand?
You make me sick.
Baby, I thought it was you.
He was dressed like you.
He was all over me, looked like
you, was talking like you.
I thought it was you, baby,
I swear to god.
Something ain't right
with him anyways.
He ain't right.
I got to get
the fuck out of here.
All right.
The fire's fine for now.
If you want more in there,
I'll give you this here.
It's a flat one.
Don't go using it all real fast
like last time.
No. No, you won't.
Should I put it in?
No, no. Don't put it in now.
That's what I'm telling you.
Hold on to it, save it
so you can be warm later.
Unless you want
to be cold later,
and don't go telling
your mom, either.
You know how she gets
about coal,
and I got to put up with her.
Your TV still got batteries?
Not really.
All right, here comes your mom.
Hide those away.
Hide the coal from your mama.
Hide it.
Make sure she don't see it.
Fuckin' crystal.
Baby, hold on to it.
Hold on to it.
Yeah.
Take my fucking goggles. What?
Take my goggles.
The lady is gonna be pissed.
I put it in my bra.
Put it in your bra.
Here's your cap'n crunch, kid.
Come on.
Fucking crystal!
Yeah, crystal.
The coal.
Jeez.
You're gonna die!
You want your mama?
Mama.
Whaa.
Think you're gonna get
what you want by crying?
You killed your mama.
See?
Blood.
You killed your mama.
Now all you have is me.
Hey, Jeremiah!
Buddy.
Hello?
This door's
not supposed to be open.
Hello?
Damn.
Stupid.
You by your lonesome, buddy?
Where you at? Quit hiding.
Down here, buddy.
You're not supposed to be
down here, Jeremiah.
I don't think.
This door was open.
I came to get some more coal.
Coal?
I ran out of coal.
Chester's gonna be real mad
finding out you're down here.
Did you break in?
No, the door was open.
I don't got no superpowers.
If you tell,
he'll take my TV away.
He'll find... Chester always
finds out about everything.
I just came down here to do us
some jiffy pop.
Jiffy pop?
You don't got that... jiffy pop.
In the refrigerator.
I wanted to surprise you.
Jeremiah, why is
all the coal on the ground?
Well, I dropped it
when I took some.
You're in trouble.
Is Chester coming down here?
Yeah, he's coming.
He said he'd meet me here.
There is jiffy pop in here!
See? Told you.
I ain't no liar to you, buddy.
You're not lying.
There's a lot in here.
If I get whupped,
we won't be able to pop it.
Open it.
No.
And we won't be able to watch
cartoons no more, either.
I want to watch cartoons
with you, too.
Well, you can help me.
If you clean up the coal and
you say you were down here...
I don't got a key.
Chester knows that.
The door was open.
It was open, right?
He won't whup you.
It may be lying, though.
No, it ain't 'cause you're down
here right now, aren't you?
Yeah, I'm down here.
And I came down here
to pop some corn, right?
If you would just tell him
that I wasn't down here,
there ain't no lying
in that, is there?
Is there?
You're a smart one, Jeremiah.
So are you, buddy.
Try to clean up
all the coal, okay?
Okay.
I'm gonna take this
so we won't run out.
Remember, don't tell Chester.
Nope, I'm not gonna tell
Chester nothing, nope.
Bye, buddy.
I'll see you soon.
Boy, that's heavy.
No.
That'll take me forever.
How did the door get open?
Chester?
Buddy, what the fuck are you
doing down here?
How the fuck
did you get down here?
I was trying
to get some jiffy pop.
Let go! Let go!
The coal is bleeding!
Would you stop with
the fucking coal nonsense?
Baby, it's a trick
of the light, all right?
Jeremiah, he's really mad.
I told you he was gonna be mad.
You're supposed
to be the smart one.
Chester...
Close the goddamn door!
We were trying to make jiffy pop
so we could watch some cartoons.
Chester, n-nothing happened.
Tell me what the fuck
happened right up, buddy!
Are you working with somebody?
Chester, I watched the meth.
If you are working with
somebody, I will kill you.
You left the door open.
I left the door...
I left the fucking...
You fucking idiot!
Jeremiah! Jeremiah!
No!
You're gonna protect him?
Fucking ungrateful bitches!
Fuck!
Come open my beer.
Aaaaaah!
Sarah.
Sarah, Sarah.
Wait here.
Keep your eyes open
and your thoughts pure.
I got us some antidote in case
I accidentally poison it.
Go.
Too red.
We'll have
to dye everything black.
It's broken.
Go away.
You have to wait a half an hour.
Mississippi one,
Mississippi two,
Mississippi three,
Mississippi four,
Mississippi five,
Mississippi six.
It's the baby.
Keep a eye on the walls.
Let me know if they're moving.
Down here, go!
Let's go, Jeremiah.
Keep an eye on the walls.
This way.
Watch it! Let's go.
It's poison.
Would you like
a piece of chocolate?
No.
It's coming.
We're gonna get it.
Come on, Sarah, duck under.
Miss, excuse me.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am, miss, excuse me.
Come here. Excuse me! Excuse me!
What?!
Easy now.
Ma'am, I need you
to open your coat,
or you can come back inside,
okay?
You think I fuckin' stole?
I don't know.
You made quite a bit of ruckus.
You're gonna be
very, very sorry.
For what?
What am I gonna be sorry for?
You want to check my cunt?
No, I don't. Thank you, miss.
Don't do that. Quit.
I'm not leaving
till you settle down.
Is she gonna be all right?
She's tired. She'll be okay.
You sure?
Yeah.
All right.
Come on, mom.
Sarah?
The sky is black fire coming.
It's all black.
Ma?
You're gonna burn, you traitor!
Sarah.
Okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I'll protect you.
It's okay.
Nobody can find us here.
It's okay.
I'll protect you.
Should I go get some supplies?
Temptation has claimed you.
You're lucky to have me.
You've just been poisoned.
You're weak, and you give in
to temptation.
Now you're gonna die.
I don't want to die.
Please...
Can I have an antidote?
You ate poison!
You ate poison!
If I die...
Who will watch the walls?
If I die...
You think I need you?
You've done nothing
but ruin everything...
Always.
I've sacrificed so much for you.
You shitty bastard.
I could have been something.
I had to give it all up for you.
By myself
I've always landed on my feet.
Don't ever forget that.
Here's your antidote.
Easy. Not all of it.
Did I get enough?
I should think so.
Damn thing's near gone.
It works, though, right?
It should.
Thank you, ma'am.
The poison's gonna fight it out
inside of you.
Get out of my car!
Get out!
Leave your sister alone.
Eat your food.
Son, are you all right?
I was poisoned.
Are you going
in to work tomorrow?
Two French toast sticks.
It's poison.
My lord!
My lord! Please help!
Somebody call an ambulance!
He's finally coming to.
You're in the hospital.
There's an I.V. In your arm
and a little tube in your nose
to help you breathe.
Now, just relax and
let them be, okay, sweetie?
Your grandma's here.
To your right.
Mama?
In this very hospital.
Fitting, isn't it?
Gone from us not six months...
Not six months, and
he ends up here half dead.
And she's in the mental ward,
same hospital, half crazed.
They found her in the middle
of memorial intersection,
stark-raving naked,
preaching of doomsday.
