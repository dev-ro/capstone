One day, eh,
we'll be busted in such a way that...
...even the son of God won't
be able to save us.
Martial Law Commandership
- Is everything ready?
- It's OK, bro.
You go to the back,
I'll be right over.
Move over!
Move over that way.
We are dashed, by God.
Is anything the matter, Dad?
The truck has been caught!
DEAR COUNCIL MEMBERS
WELCOME TO OUR TOWN
What's up, Abuzer?
What happened?
The truck has been caught.
They took Tekin away.
Couldn't sleep a wink last night.
Zehra! Throw down the keys!
Where were you caught?
By the stream.
We had just started.
I'd gone to pee,
just then they came.
Servet.
Say, Servet?
What if they take them to Diyarbakýr?
Come now!
Maybe they'll hang them, too, eh?
Don't worry so much.
They're not anarchists,
they'll just get a beating.
The thing is, get up, come.
We have other problems.
Praying for the best.
Who are they?
Artists, Tekin has invited them.
And they came for the night club.
The artists are ready,
but the night club has been arrested.
Attention, attention!
YOU FIVE ARE GENERALS
YOU RUSH INTO DIFFICULTIES
- Peace be with you.
- Same with you.
- You're welcome, Abuzer.
- Hello, Duro.
Haydar?
Come in, standing at the door like that.
- Newly arrived?
- Yeah, I've just come.
I better leave.
Didn't go home yet.
Let the players stand up.
Who am I talking to?
Who's the leader?
At your service.
It's me, Commander.
Sign it.
What is this, Commander?
Abuzer, they've banned everything.
What shall we play now?
Abuzer?
- Peace.
- Peace on you, Abuzer.
I've talked to them about Tekin.
It's alright.
Leaving that aside,
what do we do with these gals?
First, what to do with Tekin?
I've told him a hundred times.
Let's tie the place first,
then we'll find artists, I've said.
He didn't listen.
Where shall I put these two, Abuzer?
Shall I take them to my bed?
Send them to us.
We'll manage until Tekin arrives.
These are from the Rev-Left,
Commander.
This one from the Unity of Labour.
This here is a teacher, Commander.
There are individuals on the run
in the family of these two.
Which illegal organization
are these from?
These are Gevendes, Commander!
Gevende, you said?
An illegal organization?
No, Commander, just local musicians.
They were entertaining in a truck
without permission.
Truck, you say?
What sort of truck?
They've designed it like a night club,
Commander!
Are there many more of these in town?
Let those not dancing at
our wedding cry at our funeral.
Master Abuzer!!
Lorke, play Lorke.
- Banned
- What do you mean, banned?
By the decree of the commandership.
Can't be, Hadji Bedir Agha has arrived.
Look here, bro, there's a list.
And here is Lorke.
- It's banned, bro.
- OK. For the love of God...
- But silently.
- OK, silently.
Everyone shut up!
Don't let anyone play anything.
Abdu, silently.
Cut it!
Take them.
Gevende, they say.
What does Gevende mean?
A person, if engaged in music,
can't be a Gevende!
He becomes a musician.
An orchestra!
This town needs not
dowdy gevendes like this but a...
...tidy, regular orchestra!
As from today,
you'll be an orchestra, get it?
And I don't want to see
these absurd costumes again!
Find them something like a uniform!
- Let them look like a proper orchestra!
- Yes, sir!
They'll regularly
perform contemporary music at town.
Yes, sir.
And we'll welcome members
of the Council with them!
Yes, Commander.
What has my father done to them?
Move over, girl!
Forbidden! Don't wait!
I won't, before I see my father!
Come on, girl.
What has my father done
that they bring him here?!
Come on, girl.
What are you doing here?
They've taken Abuzer
from the wedding to here!
Come in.
Commander.
You know, the players downstairs...
The Colonel told them
they'll be an orchestra.
Let them be!
The Colonel told us to
give them uniforms.
Not military uniforms.
What shall we give?
Uniforms?
Why not some rank, too, Samet?
There are those uniforms
at the depot.
- I wonder...
- What uniforms?
Enemy representations.
The French.
The local orchestra is
at your command and call!
Aren't you ashamed to
have boys dance, eh?
If I see or hear you making
boys dance I'll make you...
...dance with the same
dress at the marketplace.
But, Commander,
they were touching, fondling the boy.
Me... we also
wanted him to have a craft.
Craft.
Alright.
You'll file off and march to your houses.
File off, march!!
They're coming!
They're coming!
- Where are they?
- On the road.
They've released Uncle Abuzer!
They're marching like soldiers!
Oh, my dear, my dear.
My girl, iron these!
- Dad, whatever are these?
- Uniforms, my girl, uniforms.
My girl, put this away.
Abuzer, bro, where is Tekin?
He'll come, girlie, he will.
What's the matter, Abuzer?
Why did they arrest you?
Nothing, Father.
Now we're the military orchestra.
What is an orchestra, anyway?
Brass band, brass band!
Brass band? Yes.
- So, what will you do?
- We'll play the National Anthem.
The Council will come,
they say, we'll play for them.
If somebody dies,
we'll sing by their coffin.
Repent, man, repent!
Do we sing after the dead, my son?
Who ever does such a thing?
Father, this is something like
the wake of the military.
So, does anyone ti
this so-called orchestra?
Come now, Father
come, they've put us down today...
...and you're still after the money.
Why should I be after the money?
I'm after my own life.
I needed the money for the shroud,
and that I've bought.
Three and a half meters of pure calico,
over there.
You better marry instead of joining
an orchestra!
This girl has grown up.
Any day she'll fly away.
This house needs a gal.
What use is an orchestra!
Tekin, I have to pee.
Can we stop here?
Come, girl, we'll be home in five minutes.
Hold your thing.
Tekin, the gal has trouble with
her prostate gland.
Sorry, boy.
I have to, I really have.
Will you be able to manage
this night club business?
After all,
we had some sort of order in Antep.
You're right.
Well, as of today,
we're in the military orchestra.
Don't worry.
Everything's OK.
- Easy, it hurts.
- Alright, alright.
You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
Come on, you, to bed.
You, too.
- Tekin.
- Yes, bro.
Where did you find them?
They're at pilgrimage age.
- No, bro, they have very good tables.
- Tables, you say?
If they had enlisted, they'd be unfit.
Are you going to work
at the orchestra, too?
No, father!
We'll work at the night club.
Arzum, sis,
what kind of songs do you sing?
Arzum, sis,
what kind of songs do you sing?
My lovely girl, I sing folk songs.
I sing from right here.
Sis here sings a-la-turca tango.
She's from Ýstanbul.
Don't you listen to her,
we sing whatever they ask for.
Are you a student?
- I'll enter the university exam.
- What will you study?
Depends on the grades,
but I want political science.
What you have to do with
political and such, only a girl?
Go study to be a doctor,
go be an engineer, my child.
No, not the faculty,
I will be a district governor.
God willing, my lovely girl.
May God grant your wish.
Where's your mother?
My mother passed away
while giving birth to me.
What are you doing, Tekin?
Bro, my hair is out of order,
I'm putting it into a cast.
Fuck your cast.
Aren't we going to the barber anyway?
Come, let's go.
Your heart suffers.
Look carefully.
Is there a chance of marriage?
Who knows?
Shall I say this year or the next?
Next year is too far away.
Next year is too far away.
Anything else?
Hey, you there, don't rest.
Come, get up.
Duro, come, walk.
- Here we are.
- Girlie, are you coming, too?
I forgot, Abuzer, bro.
Duro,
I swear you look like a man now.
Abuzer, bro, isn't Tekin coming?
He will, shortly.
Move on, we'll be late.
- Bro, are you a soldier?
- Fuck off, you bastards.
I'll beat you up, you,
don't annoy me.
What have they put on, eh?
Russian soldiers, yeah.
Hey stop,
you're just like falcons, man.
Now you've been cast.
Come on, walk, walk.
Thanks, master.
You know that lieutenant,
he's obsessed with me.
The first lieutenant who caught us.
I said, "Hey, wait a minute,
what are you doing?"
"Are we anarchists?
We came here as entertainers."
"Let the military chase
the mommas of all anarchists."
Look, they've finally needed me.
Good for you, bro, well said.
- You know what was the best?
- What?
I said, "Don't know. You should have
thought when putting us in."
The colonel said, "Look,
sonny, this is service to...
...your country and I've come to you."
Anyway, I've said,
"I won't do this without my bro, Abuzer."
Now, how are we going to
make ends meet?
Now, how are we going to
make ends meet?
They talk of salary and such,
but there's nothing right now.
Business is bad, anyway.
Wait till I announce the real bomb.
Today the major called me.
The night club is OK.
- I think they'll give that building.
- Which building, bro?
The previous People's Hall.
You! Come here.
Yes, Commander.
Which of these can you play?
With your permission, all of them,
Commander.
Take one.
Play this.
What?
This. The Eskiþehir Anthem.
What is this?
The mode, I mean.
- Is it something slow?
- Can't you read notes?
Notes?
Back to your place!
Allow me to handle this, Commander.
How?
The Eskiþehir Anthem, you said?
Son, don't play it like a tune
at the night club!
This is an anthem!
You play it like a slow folk song.
By the help of God,
we'll manage that, too.
What's your name?
Abuzer Yayladalý, Commander.
From now on,
you're the leader of this orchestra.
And take this.
Teach them 8 to 10 anthems
as soon as possible.
Distribute the instruments to
whoever will play them.
Yes, sir.
I'll be here in an hour.
Come here, one of you!
Gulendam!
- Yes, Grandpa?!
- Bring my pills!
I'm in pain again.
- Where are your pills, Dad?
- I'll get it.
You ran out of pills, Grandpa.
- Shall I take you to have an injection?
- Yes, yes. Hurry.
It's a good thing I've already
bought my shroud cloth.
You wouldn't wrap me in
three meters of rags.
He is obsessed with
three meters of rags!
You wouldn't even do that.
You wouldn't.
Haydar.
What are you doing?
What's this?
Son, aren't you the last one
to save this country, eh?
We are musicians. How could
we be a communist? A revolutionary?
Factories, they say, fields.
How many of you would go to
work in the field?
Just think they gave you a factory,
could you manage it?
Sonny, isn't Master Þih here?
He's at the wedding, Uncle Mahmut.
Then go tell Zeynal to
come and make my injection.
Right now, Uncle.
Grandpa, shall I go to Zehra
until you have your injection?
Alright, go.
Come back quick.
- Congratulations, Zehra, sis.
- Thank you, dearie.
- Has Haydar passed his exams?
- He did, he did.
Same to you, soon, God willing.
May you also go to faculties,
and meet your expectations.
Pass your lessons.
Be a district governor, God willing!
What book is this?
"Engels, The Origin of the Family,
Private Property and the State."
Hope nothing tangles!
My Haydar will have a family and
own up his state and...
...private property,
with the sanction of God.
He's already grown up to
become a district governor.
Isn't he himself around, Haydar?!
No, he went to see his friends.
No, he went to see his friends.
ID's.
ID's.
The whole town is like barracks.
That guy is obsessed
with the mobile night club thing.
I had a hell of a time
until I persuaded him.
You salute him and hey,
kiss his hand!
Don't worry.
Come in.
Commander, I've brought
that experienced friend.
Tekin Yayladalý, 1956,
Adýyaman, at your service!
Not necessary. Not necessary.
I don't want any commotion,
fight or array. That's one!
Yes, Commander!
You won't accept civilians for two days
a week only the officers will come.
I'll tell you which days. That's two.
Commander I say we assign
3 days of the week for you.
Not necessary!
Two days are enough.
You won't play any separatist,
destructive shit.
Or else I'll screw you!
That's three!
Don't worry, Commander.
Craft, eh, craft.
Here, Abuzer,
what sort of a drum stick is this?
Just look,
they've wrapped felt on its tip!!
I better play with my own stick.
Just look at this drum.
It's not even skin.
They made it of nylon.
Listen to the sound.
Pat pat. Like an infant farting.
Is this the sound of a drum?
Abuzer, bro, this takes air from the
welded joints. Let me play my own pipe.
Abuzer, bro, this takes air from the
welded joints. Let me play my own pipe.
It seems you've
disposed of my mother, you cads!
Listen to me now, eh.
This is a big chance for us.
There's a salary,
and we won't put up with drunks.
Our people are afraid of a uniform.
In the past did anyone
take heed of the municipal police?
But now they've become bullies.
Listen, friends.
Let's appreciate our jobs.
Come, friends, come.
What's with this stick?
This stick is very important.
The moment I do this, the snare drums
and drums will beat boom boom.
Then, when I do this...
Then, when I do this...
...the wind instruments
will blow with all their might.
This motion is very important.
When I do this,
you will turn your pages altogether.
Just like this. Understood?
Now get instruments.
Hey!
You'll go on playing
while you turn pages.
Now get your own instrument.
And that's it.
What's up?
Oh, sonny,
what kind of a picture is this?
Their asses changed
place with their heads.
- Gu-er-ni-ca! Picasso!!
- Pic-ass-o.
Guardian!
Open the door, guardian!
Guardian!
Open the door, guardian!
Have you got tuberculosis,
my poor girl?
Daddy!
No one gives us bread, Daddy.
Don't go to any door,
they will send you away, my dear.
They will give you a beating,
'cause your dad's a prisoner.
Servet Records.
Cords - cords - cords.
Cumhuriyet Main Street
Reet - reet - reet.
Proudly presents.
So, that's it, let's give it up.
So, that's it, let's give it up.
You know that folk song...
...I always remember Momma
when I listen to it.
That's the reason,
or else why should I cry?
Because her name is Suna, too...
OK, what's the folk song
that makes you laugh?
Crying goes hand in hand with laughing!
Those who don't cry, don't laugh.
Did you play it so I will laugh?
Don't you know it?
It's the anthem
Communist International!
Oh! Isn't it banned?
It is.
Haydar,
I saw the books in your suitcase.
Why are the covers different
from the books themselves?
I wish you wouldn't
deal with such stuff!
You never know,
something bad may happen to you.
Look here, Gulendam.
These people put thousands of
innocent people to jail.
They will topple within two or
three months anyway but...
...we still have to react!
This is our debt of
honour to our people.
Let our people be patient for 3 months.
What's 3 months?
Well, it is...
You must have a girl-friend
at the university, don't you!?
You must have a girl-friend
at the university, don't you!?
No, none.
These are habits for
the petite bourgeoisie!
And I've now become
a revolutionary!
Good for you.
Uncle Tekin!
You know,
they'll open the night club here.
The night club culture,
is something disgusting.
The night club culture,
is something disgusting.
Relies completely
on the body of women...
It's a place where
a woman's body is exploited!
And the most
low-down exploitation of all!
She's a sweet one.
This Dilber looks like
a very decent gal.
I'd propose to her
but it's not proper with you around.
What proposal, Daddy?
I'll marry this gal,
God willing.
But it won't be appropriate
while you're a bachelor.
If you find a good one,
they're even more chaste!
If you find a good one,
they're even more chaste!
Miss Semra also looks like
a decent woman!
And she's looking at you sadly.
Hey, Father, I thought you had
the shroud cloth ready?!
Get off, you.
OK, good night to you.
Come, sis, come.
Let us also get going.
Good night to all.
Goodbye, ladies.
Good evening.
Goodbye, dearie.
Sis, why are you always singing
at the night club?
My child, did you have
any other alternative in mind?
The night club culture
humiliates the woman body.
Women are exploited
in this system twice, anyway!
My girl, what culture
should there be in a night club?
I did have one or
two cultured customers, I did.
Never mind.
Never mind.
No, auntie. By culture,
I meant the night club milieu.
Night clubs are better than home.
Don't do the dishes.
Right.
The salvation of all oppressed women
depends on revolution.
Wrong.
We have also witnessed revolution.
By the general Cemal Gürsel.
Then I had a client, a young and
handsome officer. Crazy for me.
He comes every night.
He said I can be a union
member after the revolution.
Well, I was young then.
I hurried to...
Who was that, our...
- Necibe's husband?
- Was that Ökkes, the whoremonger?
No, not him. Resat.
Resat, the pimp.
May God curse him.
I was young,
I went to him like an idiot and said:
"They say we can also be
union members."
- What do you think he told me?
- What?
"One pimp is enough for a night club,
second too much."
The Communist International.
Now we have to find a record player.
Do you have a record player?
Yeah, we do.
Why did you ask?
- What? Couldn't you read it?
- No, I've finished!
What do you think?
You know, my heart is torn.
How cruel can they be?
Would a human do these
to another human being?
What book is this?
Remember, we talked about it.
Socialism. A book on socialism.
You certainly should read it!
And this, you say,
I should listen to?
You know what that is?
The anthem I had played for you
on my instrument!
Gulo, you know this council is
coming here.
We should make them regret that
they ever came.
Record the anthem from the
record player to this cassette.
I will play it in the square
on the day of the meeting.
Let them listen to the International
at top volume.
What if they see you?
WE OWE OUR PEACE TO YOU
WE OWE OUR PEACE TO YOU
Hey! Gevendes!
Move aside.
You know
what I'll do with that drum stick.
Shut up!
This is the orchestra of the military.
If so much as a button snaps,
they will remarry your mom.
- You'll get six months, at least.
- Jail, you mean?
Jail, of course.
Wait! Did you curse the council?!
No, never, man.
Never thought of it.
May God help you.
The road is yours, please go on.
- That's more like it.
- Alright, bro.
Fuck off.
IMPROVES FAMILIAL RELATIONS
Master Abuzer, a good time in bed.
No, it's only for the kids.
It's Abuzer.
For the kids.
And this is Turkish delight.
You shouldn't have bothered.
You should be tired.
Let me make you some coffee.
How are you, Father?
I'm like shit, Abuzer,
how should I be?
What's the matter?
Nothing.
My pulse has gone up.
Father, you drink
too much coffee, that's why.
But you don't even like coffee.
But you don't even like coffee.
What coffee?
It's because of this daughter of yours.
Look, look, listen to it.
It's as if they have put
forty town criers in a room...
...and they're making them cry non-stop.
You can't hear either the drum,
or the pipe.
It ends, then she starts it again.
It ends, then she starts it again.
Listen, now.
How does the bird sing?
She has even corrupted the bird.
Gulendam,
what's this you're listening to, girlie?
Nothing, Dad, just music.
Play it once more.
Put up the volume, my girl.
A compound mode.
In heathen language?
What are they saying?
Greeting spring.
Classical music, dad.
You know, like Mozart and such.
About the coming of spring.
Birds singing, etcetera. That.
Something international.
International?
So, it's name is international, is it?
Coffee?
Turkish delight?
Come, let's have our picture taken.
Who will take it?
All right.
I was going to say something.
How shall I put it?
Trouble for you if I say it.
Trouble for me if I don't!
I wish we were staying
at the same house...
...then I would record songs
for you till early morning.
You would read me books.
We'd be educated so well!
Gulendam...
...we shouldn't think about such things.
This is not the day for it.
In this fire and gunpowder.
And revolutionaries are
only engaged with death, anyway.
OK, what about
after the junta topples?
Gulendam, come in, girlie.
Do you have...
...a boyfriend or fiancee?
Revolutionaries are
only engaged with death!
What sort of a fiancee
would death make?
Don't revolutionaries have a soul?
Don't they desire to have a nice woman,
all dressed and made up...
...say some sweet words to him?
Don't they want?
We have a companion,
Haydar, and he says...
...this is not the time to
think of such things.
The junta will be toppled
in three months.
Maybe after that...
What does your
companion Haydar do?
Is he a builder,
a worker, a tile maker?
No, no, he's at the university
What builder?
Are you in love with
this companion Haydar?
No, no, not me, but a friend of mine.
Haydar, our companion, told her:
This day is not the day,
there are other things to think of.
You tell that friend...
...when companion Haydar comes
not to treat him like a fellow soldier.
To behave like a woman.
Or else she'll miss many
the like of Haydar.
Let her make surprises,
my dear girl.
Something nice.
Things that he will like.
She does,
but Haydar looks elsewhere.
He doesn't see her.
If this companion
is looking elsewhere...
...then let your friend do
what I'm doing.
Let her stand where he's looking!
This place is much better.
No more wandering
around the countryside for you.
No more trucks or male dancers!
Thanks, Suphi.
We'll await you at the opening.
Look here,
Abuzer, you know I like you.
Tell your daughter to take care,
many blighters around!
I mean, they so easily meet with
Servet's brother.
There are those who know them,
and those who don't.
God forbid,
they may smear this spotless girl.
And they'd better
have the tailor cut the shroud, Suphi!
Come on, man, move over.
Opening tomorrow.
I told you because I look onto
her like my daughter.
I told you because I look onto
her like my daughter.
Is it pained again?
- What?
- My heart.
No, man, don't take heed.
It's destiny.
Damn.
God is great, while he closes one door,
he opens another. Don't worry.
Father, shall I put on your medicine?
You didn't have supper, either.
We worked like hell, but we finished it.
It will be an exceptional night club.
- Uncle Tekin?
- Yes?
As if your job isn't enough...
...are you now turning our public houses
into night clubs?
How long will these times,
this cloud of dust will last?
Aren't you afraid of having
the revolutionaries slap you?
The dog reached spring...
...but God knows how he suffered.
Ours is the same story, my dear.
We are gevende.
Wedding performers.
They have the wedding...
...we have the misery.
My mother passed away
when I was 4.
I gave you her name:
Gulendam.
I gave you her name:
Gulendam.
Even the mountains saluted
when her name was uttered.
She said to the sun and the moon,
don't you rise, I will.
Such a calamitous beauty.
Don't have the same destiny,
but she was just like you.
My mother died of hunger, hunger!
We went to many weddings,
my dad and I...
...to survive.
He used to make me dance
in women's costumes.
Sometimes we both dressed,
and danced together.
Many a time,
we have been appetizers for drunks.
You know, this people of yours...
I have been slapped by
them ever since I was born.
All I cared was to
keep you away from that slap.
All I cared was to
keep you away from that slap.
And I was the one to slap you.
What else can I tell you?
What else can I tell you?
At ease! Attention!
At ease! Attention!
- Good morning.
- Sir!
Chief, what is this?
Music for greeting spring.
Look here, think of the spring,
of children, of birds.
Either bird, or child.
Same for me.
Both will fly away.
Then something like this.
Chief, you've become sort of a saint.
From now on,
only God can cope with you.
Oh, oh, listen to the mode.
How lovely.
Chief, you said children,
birds, greeting the spring...
...but I swear to God,
even if you didn't...
...I saw birds passing and such.
Just like spring.
Wait, just a moment!!
Welcoming spring or
welcoming the Council!
Can't we make a
welcoming tune out of this?
- Easily we can.
- And it will be so great.
Come, don't.
Your job is to make the customers drink.
Look, if you blunder on stage...
Here, Tekin, sonny.
I'll blunder if I don't drink this poison.
Leave me alone.
Look, Semra. First you sing
"For its Air and Water".
Then, "Turkey, Turkey,
My Heaven."
Take care not to
make any mistakes, ever.
Tomorrow night, all is free.
Do whatever you want.
That's enough, Tekin.
Are you teaching manners
to a seasoned performer?
We were in this life before
your dad conceived you...
That's enough?
What's all the hurry,
like a mad sheep?
What's all the hurry,
like a mad sheep?
Bro, the curfew is about to start,
and we couldn't get out.
Why should you worry?
The owners of the ban are inside.
Let them think.
Our esteemed commanders.
Exceptional guests.
You've honoured our music hall.
Welcome.
We will be proud to serve,
the ones who...
...have maintained peace
and security in our country.
Welcome.
Now, I'd like to present a
most extraordinary voice...
...from the east and the
southeast of the country.
Nightingales chirp in her throat,
a rosy faced...
...sweet talking lady.
Aydeniz Derya!
Welcome, worthy visitors, dear guests.
You have honoured us.
When the country needs unity and
solidarity most...
...I will start my program with
"My Country", taken from...
...an esteemed lady artist,
Ayten Alpman.
Sonny, we already listen to
these songs day and night.
- Tell them to play something else!
- Yes, sir!
I'll come in the evening,
I'll come in the evening.
Is Hadji Baba home?
I'll come in the evening,
I'll come in the evening.
Where are the keys?
The keys are at the window,
The hen cooks in the pan.
Good. We worked for state and
country today.
I hope tomorrow it'll be
the daily bread of our children.
If you must kill me,
then shoot me, Haydar.
Then I'd say my death was
at the hands of my brother.
The International project failed!!
Stop!
What a scandal!
Will they play
at the victory ball like that?
Commander, they composed
this anthem for the Council.
If you don't like it, we'll have
them play something else.
It's not the anthem.
I mean the hair and moustaches.
Like the wrestler Zaloglu Rustem.
Get them shaved.
- Cut their hair, beard and moustache.
- Yes, sir.
A very good anthem.
That's how you be an orchestra.
What's the need for the junta?
Everyone has become a junta member,
anyway.
Who's to blame them?
Even afraid of their shadows.
A lot of informers.
We should find another form of action.
We'll find another form...
...and your father will see it,
and he will prevent it.
We'll find another,
and Gulendam won't like that.
She'll abstain and say let our people
wait for 3 months.
In fact, he's right.
I have an idea.
Do you have calico?
Are you going to make a banner?
Everyone makes welcome banners
for the Council.
Sorry, no calico left.
The land registrar died,
they came but none left.
Friends, Oh God, let's pray.
It's me, Suphi.
Very important, Commander.
I'm telling, sir.
Seyho of the Poccuks
didn't join the funeral prayer...
...and, I'm ashamed to say, swore.
There are many people
on the run in their families, sir.
Yes, sir.
Gani, the Hafiz,
took short cut of God's benediction.
He didn't recite God of the morning light.
Be it known.
The generals of the Natlonal Coucll
wlll vlslt our town tomorrow.
Precautlons have been taken
for a blg partlclpatlon.
The publlc Is therewlth advlsed.
Esteemed Commander,
our valuable guests.
Welcome all to the
30 August Victory Day ball.
Now I invite our esteemed
Commander and his worthy...
...spouse on stage to
make the first tango.
Now other guests can also
join in the dance. Herewith declared.
How long do you have to serve?
- Six months yet.
- Good for you, you've almost finished.
It's so difficult for me...
...not to make, not to be able to
make an act of protest.
Is it your fault?!
I hope those junta men are killed
rather than come here!
Would it be better if
anything happened to Servet?
Hope to God they'll come,
but won't be able to leave.
That's it.
If in the future your children
ask what you did in days...
...of blood and gore,
you'll say we couldn't find cloth...
...to make a banner,
but at least we've cursed.
Hope to God.
If He will show those days to us.
And who knows,
I can stage a surprise action!
If we're left to a piece of cloth.
Won't tell the children
about the lack of cloth in the future.
Shall we dance?
I don't know how to.
They don't, either.
They don't, either.
What are you doing?
I want to surprise
our companion Haydar.
Something he'll like!
What kind of a surprise is this?
Well...
Whose companion
did you say this Haydar was?!
- Very nice dresses.
- Look here.
- Won't she be angry?
- She won't, don't worry.
Come on.
Abuzer.
Get ready we're starting.
Yes, sir.
Men, take your places.
Don't forget to
watch the movements of the stick.
What was this?
Got it, alright.
Commander, they're coming.
They are playing the International.
You stay here.
Look here,
isn't this the International?
General, a big conspiracy!
We must immediately leave!
LET THERE BE NO JUNTA
CLOSED
Play a "between the tombs", bro.
Which of you is Abuzer Yayladalý?
Which of you, I've said?
Where did you learn this anthem, eh?
Who gave it to you?!
I've...
...I've composed it!
Myself.
Daaad!!!
Sit down, girl.
Come here, you.
Come here.
Is there a cure, ah
For a dagger wound?
Don't be pitiless, don't.
Does the dagger bearer have any faith?
Don't strike, tyrant, don't take lives...
...don't be ruthless!
Don't forget the right of conscience...
...don't be faithless!
Mom, I'm ready,
come on, I'm late for school.
Alright, give it here.
The 96-member
Russlan Army chorus...
...has been the guests of
Mesut Yar last evenlng.
What's this, Mom?
This...
...was the composition of
my late father.
Something international.
