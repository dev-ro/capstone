So there, we'll see.
Have you brought drinks too, Anna?
- Yes, it is included.
- It's fine. So.
Where. Chop-chop.
Now I'm stuck in my mitten.
We're not that stressed, are we?
We should be there in ten.
We'll have time to eat before Kalle.
Now we hurry
so dad has time to look at Kalle.
It's not just me who sees Kalle.
No, but you are probably the last one
in the world who think it is important.
- God jul.
- God jul.
- How many packages will I receive?
- Of these?
After all, it's just mom and me
who receive the packages here.
But I want packages!
Mom and Dad
has been the kindest this year.
- Nah!
- Yes, it's just a matter of digging in.
- Merry Christmas! -Who were they there?
- No clue.
- It was you who greeted.
- I don't know...
- God jul!
- God jul.
- God jul!
- God jul!
Hello, how beautiful you are!
- Package.
- How many do you have?
- Little herring.
- God, have you done this yourself?
It's Alex, he's domestic.
My God, this kind of thing doesn't work
to buy for money anymore.
In the old days, you had to
to cook everything yourself.
The same aggregate they use
in the Hahnenkammrennen in Austria!
It's worth it!
It's only Christmas once a year!
- Cozy.
- Huh?
- It's cozy!
- Yes.
- Oh, that was a bit rough.
- They normally add a little sugar.
But not in this one.
65 calories per unit.
- He is obsessed with this.
- I have lost 16 kilos.
I think we say hello
and welcome to our guests.
How wonderful that you are here.
A bit silly perhaps-
- but we said just before you came that
We have such wonderful friends.
Oh, how cute you are.
We think the same way.
You take a lot for granted as a man
like... shouldn't do, maybe.
And.
- What are you going to do this summer?
- We haven't talked about it yet.
The guest house is finished now,
the girls can have it themselves.
Or you, if you want some adult coziness.
It sounds super nice, really.
But can we suck it up a bit
if that's okay or?
- Do you have other plans?
- No absolutely not.
We just haven't talked to each other yet,
about it.
Cheers, you hear. Again.
- We are going to divorce.
- Damn! I felt it!
- Peace...
- It was in the air.
- The children know nothing yet.
- Now we still have to say it like it is.
- Is this a joke?
- This was not the intention.
Well, I wanted to say
as it was direct-
- but you wanted to wait
until after Christmas Eve. Yes, it was.
Yes. It's not drama
in this...
- Not dramatic?
- No.
Surely you don't get divorced
for no reason?
I have met another.
Baby please,
can't we take this another time?
It's Christmas Eve, we have a lot of food here
and it will soon be Kalle.
- Can't we have a little fun?
- Merry Christmas.
Damn! Damn shit tee!
Of course you are different,
therefore you are together.
- Are Mickan and I alike, or not?
- No, but...
- There was a lot of squealing...
- Squeaky?
- Yes, fractions. We argued all the time.
- It's included.
Then you want something,
then there is contact.
And make-up sex is the best,
when you're still pissed off.
Yes, but now it wasn't like that.
We were tired of each other.
She wasn't happy... with me.
- You should have said something.
- What?
Don't know, same as now. I could
come up with tips or something.
Me and Mickan
been through a lot.
Sometimes you have to stop and
listen, understand and take a step back.
This is how you advance two steps, stop,
listens, understands, takes a step back.
Then you slip forward two steps,
stops, listens, understands...
Do you see how I gain ground
although I back off, understand and listen?
Very smart.
This was a joint decision.
- Common?
- Yes it was.
So you went to work
and had tingling in his pants-
- while she lay
with that mountain goat?
- It could have been me who...
- Or how...
- No, maybe not.
- No.
Love is complicated.
Now it turned out like this.
You let
like a bad Ted Gärdestad song.
You are so passive. She will
not back by itself.
- I don't want her!
- Why aren't you dating, then?
It's been several months! One shows
interest in the opposite sex-
- if you are single. Or some sex,
I don't know what you wear.
It's been almost five minutes.
Commit a stroke here and drive over.
You have no idea which couple dinners
I have to suffer.
You can pretend to be interested in
some man sitting in a sleeveless cardigan.
- I'm too old! I don't want to!
- Sad to hear.
I am truly sorry.
I will not divorce again.
Anette, this is a handicapped spot,
it's a thousand at least.
It is five in.
Sow. It's going well.
It's fine. Good...
Darling...
So... Is it just my fault?
It doesn't feel reasonable,
we have children since before.
Maybe it's the eggs
which is not tiptop?
No, the eggs are great.
And uterus and fallopian tubes too.
You are like a twenty year old.
But the sperm,
they unfortunately swim very poorly.
They must have forgotten how to do...
Darling, there are so many
who adopt.
It could be great,
but also very bad.
Like buying the secret box
at auction. "What nice tableware!"
Then each cup is edge supported.
You can never know that.
Marielle has eczema.
There is a difference, right?
It runs in the family.
Lottie Rahm for example. Or
Boy Dinkenspiel. Loppy Boding.
- Do you know...
- No! You know, Potzie Rosensvärd.
She is single now.
She's a little too pretty for Alex-
- but she is supposed to be desperate.
He can make a chap.
I want
that he goes back to Anna!
- They just got divorced!
- Not formally.
There is a six-month consideration period.
And he is still in love with her.
He's too proud to admit it.
She might discover that the grass
is brown on the other side with.
Darling, you are so romantic.
Our grass always comes
to be green.
- We have artificial grass.
- Not everywhere.
Anna is driven in, you don't
the entire recruitment process.
She is as she is
but it is very worth it.
We haven't met her at all
since Christmas.
How much is it really worth?
- Hello!
- Whoops...
- It was a long time ago!
- Hello!
Oh, we were just talking about you.
- We haven't met since last Christmas.
- No, it's been a long time.
- Is everything good?
- Yes. That's great, I think.
We really tried rin...
Or thought we should call you.
No, but my God.
You don't have to feel that way.
Alex is an old friend. It is quiet.
- You are too.
- Yes Yes.
What are you doing on Friday,
do you want to come over for dinner?
- Now on Friday?
- Yes, now on Friday.
Yes, that...
Now I have the children this week.
Bring them,
it's been a long time since we saw them.
- And David lives with me now.
- Yes, bring him.
The more, the merrier. Peace
I also wanted to meet him.
- What were you thinking?!
- How would I do? So embarrassing!
Anna is one thing but how could you
invite that climbing mouse?
Because you just stood there, completely silent!
Yes, you should have too.
Renegades!
We can call
and say we are sick.
No, absolutely not.
Of course you should go.
- Are you sure about it?
- Yes indeed.
Is there anything else here now?
No, I stocked up on some basic goods
and like that.
You should be fine all week.
- Shall I swish you?
- No, I'll take that.
- You can top up next week...
- Absolutely.
- With some new if necessary.
- I do.
You... David, will he
live here this week, right?
- Yes, that's the idea.
- He does that?
I was just thinking…
There is usually some hair left in
the sink from when he has shaved.
- If he can dry it out a bit.
- Absolutely.
- I will perform that.
- No biggie, but...
No, but it's clear.
Just one more little thing.
Duvets and bed sheets.
- Can you sort and fold a little too?
- Should I do it at once?
No, I'm still going to change the sheets
so I'll fix it now.
Thanks thanks.
Oh, God, now I'm coming
make it through a whole week.
I don't want you to go.
Old man, a week goes by fast.
Then I'll be back. -Hello!
- We can pull and climb.
- Yes!
Go to the Climbing Agency.
- May I come along?
- Yes.
Okay.
- We can send pictures if you want.
- Love to. Nice.
- Anna has your number, right?
- Yes absolutely.
- I was joking.
- Yes, well...
But see you later.
- Who wants pancakes?
- Bye. See you.
- Pancakes with jam and what?
Mayonnaise?
- Waiter, the man!
- Wait, hello.
Oh...
Yeah, so this is where you're hiding?
Oops, here it was
the heels on the ceiling.
It's just the way it is.
- What are you doing on Friday, mein Herr?
- Friday?
You don't have the kids, I do
checked. Don't try it.
No. No I do not know...
- I guess I have to check a bit.
- Colander.
Yes, it's a bit like that.
It's a kitchen.
It's time
that you get over Anna now.
Please stop.
That's no problem for me.
- I feel good.
- Really?
Anna left you for a hunk.
Of course it stings.
Even Marielle gets it.
We talk about it at home.
"What about Alex, Dad?"
What should I say to Marielle?
"He was left for
a prettier guy with charisma"?
Listen. We're going to turn the tables.
You and I, the boys gravel,
going out and getting snuff.
Have the worst smokehouse night
as in the past.
And I don't take no for an answer.
It's just a matter of hooking up.
- Ja...
- The ladies! The sexy ladies!
The meaning was that you should get
the flowers, the table setting and me.
Shall we try it? So.
- There you go, hope it works.
- Thanks.
Now I'm smiling very unnaturally
on this.
Okay, I'll have to do this myself.
Mom, can I ask something?
How did Che Guevara really die?
Darling, I can't do anything
about Pokemons. Ask a friend.
- He's not a Pokemon.
- Do not swear.
- I have a very important exam.
- This is also important!
We are having a dinner.
As you may see. -Hello?
Have you died or
can you come out and help?
- You can shit in peace, right?
- Can I do something?
Yes, you can turn on the vacuum cleaner,
thanks.
Happy Friday,
the guests are on their way.
- It's this big button, huh?
- Yes.
Come out now!
Do I have to do everything myself?
I'm not the one who invited them!
Yes, you heard me. I have done everything
to stop this.
- Are you sitting on the mug?
- Yes. It's open cards!
You can meet whoever you want.
I do not want to! Mickan forces me!
Listen, I'll send you a link.
It goes to an app
you have to download in the mobile phone.
What are you talking about?
This is how you get my login details
and get access to my alarm system.
Click on the camera symbols
so you can see the live feed from the dinner.
At any time you can see
how boring i am.
- Why should I...?
- Because I want you to be safe!
Know where I stand
in this conflict of interest.
Now they come.
- What are you doing? Come.
- I'm here!
- Hello!
- Hello. David.
- Mikaela.
- Tjena, Freddan.
- Hello!
- Do you know each other?
Yes, we have worked together
at Carnegie.
- For...
- 17 years ago.
- Hello, old man!
- Hello.
- Huh?
- Hello, hello...
Damn, how rich you are!
- Hello, friend!
- Tha!
- Qué tal?
- What a mess it is! Unbelievable.
- Is there a club tonight?
- No clue.
- We're not going in here.
- Okay... Where are we going, then?
Then I ask
to welcome everyone-
- for the evening's singles mingling
here at the Medieval Museum in Stockholm.
My name is Anders. Don't get attached
at that, but at each other.
- This was delicious.
- God, what fun.
Yes, it really was...
What is that?
- Fisk.
- Ja...
But you, this thing with…
It wasn't what you wanted
continue with the job as you...?
No, it didn't work.
After -01 it was done.
It became too difficult.
There were a lot of hedge funds...
- The Financial Supervisory Authority.
- Yes, they showed up.
Boo! All of a sudden they were there.
You have to be smart
differently. It's you.
- It suits you much better.
- Uh, I don't know...
- You've always been smart.
- You are quick with pallets.
Now you compete against algorithms like
must sense tendencies and trends.
- There Freddan is very good!
- You have to be a little sensitive sometimes.
- It is you.
- Receptive. But you were good too.
Me? What am I good at?
Living in a tent.
- That's what I can do! Are you camping?
- No.
- It was a clear no.
- You have a party tent.
The plagues were, of course, many
in Stockholm during the Middle Ages.
Plague, cholera, leprosy,
yes, whatever you want.
What do you think this woman suffered from?
- Boredom.
- Yes, good guess.
I might have thought more
on the plague itself. We continue.
Yes, or exhaustion. They cuckoo
like rabbits in the Middle Ages.
- Did they?
- Yes, then.
- Ove? I'm leaving.
- No, we just arrived!
- This is not my thing.
- I get it.
I have a hook on the worst cougar!
What are you doing?
Am I not single?
Soon there may be two of us. Anette and
I'm having a really bad time right now.
Sorry, I didn't know.
No, maybe you should ask
how someone else feels sometime.
Don't just sit on your own arsehole
and cure twilight all the time.
- God, how glorious he is!
- Do you think so?
Yes! How did you meet?
It's funny. I would go on
such a "find yourself lecture".
And then it was David who lectured.
So you can say
that I found him instead.
I can understand you wanting to move on.
You and Alex are very different.
But how do you finance that?
Or how do you make a living...?
- Just put the stuff there.
- I get a little adventurous.
Ski to the North Pole with someone
middle manager from Spotify, lecture.
Yes, you do. No, have coffee.
Just so you know, I understand
that this is sensitive for you.
I know
that you are old friends with Alex.
- I don't want to be the bad guy.
- No danger, I don't think about that.
I don't go to bed
other people's divorces.
- Are you sure?
- Yes Yes.
Why should one go around feeling bad
if you can walk around and feel good?
Exactly, that's exactly it
as it depends.
I felt like I was on
to become a real bitter pussy.
I was literally falling asleep.
Yes, don't fall asleep
but more relationally, then.
My body. And then I felt:
If I'm not feeling well, I'm nobody
good mother to the children too.
And aren't the children well,
are you not well
- Yes, it goes around.
- Like a boomerang.
Exactly! Then you can take a little
hard decisions. Like: "Fuck off!"
- But do you say "fuck off" then?
- Mm, it's "fuck off".
There are so many out there who would
feel so much better in their lives-
-if they could say it a little more often.
- I understand exactly what you mean.
- Right? There are so many.
This of course meant
that the representatives of the church-
- not only had
an immense spiritual power-
- over people
in medieval Sweden...
- How is it spelled?
- Black ops. The one before.
...even more the earthly salvation,
thus the knight class.
We'll look at that a little more out here.
- How could I miss this?
- You have everything here.
Tomahawk, blades, carbine...
I don't have an A driver's license!
Damn, how good you are! So damn good!
...as said, the worldly salvation
then consisted of the knight class and...
Off with the suit
because I don't want the money!
Now we drink coffee!
- Alex...
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- You're pulling my arm.
Can't pull people by the arm anymore-
- because they can stand
and keep boiling hot coffee on one?
- Sorry, that was not the intention.
- If it's chemistry, you'll have to brag.
- It's Mauritz's shirt.
- Why do you have Mauritz's shirt...?
We're screwing with this now, it's nothing
fun anymore. Done for today.
I can't get a stab
if I look like this.
- How many numbers did you get?
- None. I didn't take any numbers.
But... Yes, maybe it was a little
secondary sorting in there-
- but so are you.
Don't be too demanding.
I got three numbers, in one night.
- William, you have not initialed here.
- Yes, I wrote it down there.
That's me.
Then you have signed and initialed
on the same page. You shouldn't.
- You can do that.
- Maybe you shouldn't do that.
Schiller, can you sign there?
- Isn't it called pagination?
- No, it's page numbering.
- Did you say fuck off to Lussan?
- Yes.
- Why that?
- Because I think she rubs.
She's trying to break me,
preferably above all others.
Do you know what social media is?
Yes, when you are chatting
in social apps and doing…
No, it's a war.
A Third World War
where everyone is shooting at everyone.
Then terror balance is good.
But Lussan doesn't do that.
- She bombs one person, me!
- I don't really keep up.
If I buy a bag that is like this
and lays out-
-then she buys a bag like this.
- Sort it out with her.
- That's what I did!
You are scratchy on Instagram,
you're just pinging me like shit.
- Skavigt?
- I.
- I don't understand anything.
- You understand exactly.
Don't you think I know you get it
that I understand that you understand?
Out with it,
otherwise you can leave here.
Fuck off!
- How did she take it, then?
- Good. She took it well.
- Thank you.
- Don't forget the dental floss too.
- It is actually important.
- I promise. Bye.
- That was the last one, huh?
- Yes, but you also have the seller.
Yes Yes. Okay.
Hello! Bella Skolander.
Yes, hello, hello.
Håkan is not left, is he?
- Håkan?
- Yes, you are from Kultzer, right?
- No, it's our competitors.
- Oh okay. I have them.
- Men...
- Jaha.
Although I like to look
what you have in the box.
We can offer both prefabricated
and patient-specific solutions.
The aesthetics are always integrated
in the design, as needed.
Delivery time two working days.
- You don't recognize me, do you? Or?
- Yes, maybe a little.
Café Opera last Friday,
We met outside.
- Well, did we?
- Yes. So, we didn't talk.
But you looked at me.
You turned around...
Yes! Was it you who had
this african shirt, big?
- No, it was my friend.
- Yes, it was you who was next to me.
- But you weren't in there then.
- No, we were...
We never went in.
We went a bit further on singles mingling.
- Single Mingle.
- Yes, it was very strange.
It sounds pretty exciting otherwise.
Yes... This was exciting
also actually...
That was it...
- Ebb!
- But what is it about?
Ebb!
There.
What the hell have you done
with the vacuum cleaner?
- It's the lawnmower!
- What do you know? You never clean.
- They are knives, don't you see?
- Victor! Hello? Victor!
Do we really have to
worst thing about this?
- Do you know how much the carpet costs?
- Why are you so fixated on money?
- Relax a little.
- What the hell are you saying?! Huh?!
Our money
comes from my father's work.
He works very hard because we
should be able to have it this good.
This is like you
shredding his work.
Work? I don't know...
The financial industry, what the hell is that?
You help rich people
to become richer.
Do something sensible, dammit.
Get a real job.
- Put your feet down!
- Just be quiet now.
- Hello?
- Hello. This is Alex Löfström here.
Yes, hello! Do you want to buy
some insanely expensive implants?
- No...
- See?
I thought more…
I sat and thought about
when we talked there...
It was... If it were to be
so that you thought that...
- I think so.
- What?
- Or what were you thinking?
- No, what were you thinking?
- You said...
- What, what did I say?
- "I think so", you said.
- I sometimes think ahead a bit.
Yeah... But what were you thinking, then?
- Yes, what was I thinking? I thought...
- What did you think?
If we were to meet maybe sometime?
Yes, but exactly! It was...
That's actually what I was thinking.
How fun!
If you feel like it
that would be very fun.
Maybe we can take... Yes...
Take... A cinema?
Been?
- Alex!
- Ness, hello there!
- Sorry, I'm always late.
- No...
- Have you been here long?
- No, I just had time to buy tickets.
- Shall we have some candy?
- No, it's not good for the teeth.
Or? Although you sell implants.
- You might want us to drop...
- Bella?
- Who is that?
- What are you doing here?
- Who is that?
- My colleague with whom I am going to the cinema.
- You never said it was a dude.
- Sorry, Alex.
Alex? -Tjena Alex.
And you sell implants, right?
- Sorry, who are you?
- Who am I?
I am the one who is together with her.
But maybe you didn't know that, right?
- Yes, yes.
- Did you know that?
- What is KFB then?
- KFB?
He doesn't sell implants.
He doesn't even know what KFB is.
It is "jawbone anchored bridge". Here.
Alex?
Waiter, the man.
We are interested in history.
Especially the Reformation and life
in medieval Stockholm.
- It just happened to be singles?
- Maybe it.
It wasn't something I noticed.
I was busy watching
the amazing wax dolls.
Which? Well, these wax dolls?
There. Vivi. Lina.
And then they have phone numbers.
It was a bit funny.
- But that...
- What?
- That... Those...
- It's my rags.
That's right.
I asked Ove to write down some numbers -
- because I had no book. Ove helped
me to write up some... chicks.
Alex, you are very bad at lying.
I just wanted to
be prepared for the worst.
The worst?
Yes... If you would...
...leave me.
I damn well know
no longer deliver.
I feel like a noble eunuch.
I understand exactly if you want
another with gunpowder in the syringe.
Because here you have nothing to get.
It's dry here.
And I went on
that damn single mingle-
-to... see if I still...
- ...have something.
- It's actually true.
He has been quite scared
for you to leave him.
But...
But I'm not interested
by some adventurer with stomachaches.
How would it be?
That we end up
in each depressing apartment like Alex.
- But I love you.
- Yes...
- And we both know what we want.
- Yes.
And if it doesn't work
in the usual way so...
Yes, though...
No, that door is closed.
I won't
to raise some cuckoo chicks.
- Anything, but not that.
- What the hell is the problem?
If you love Anette
then you get to meet her a bit.
There are a thousand ways
to have children on.
Adoption and surrogacy
and what the hell do i know.
You have each other.
That's what's important, isn't it?
Take heart that it will be little
different than you originally thought.
Lock up after you guys, I'm going for a walk.
Yes, but I understand.
I have also been a teenager.
You want to go your own way,
you want to find yourself and...
I argued a lot with grandfather
at your age.
Regardless of what you think and think
then i will always love you.
Even if I'm a socialist?
Now it was
a bit hypothetical perhaps.
Huh? What is it?
It is when you talk about things like
does not exist but could exist.
But do socialists exist?
Then I want to ask you something,
do you hang out with Elias something?
Just because Elias lives in Fiskis
He doesn't need to be a socialist.
No, but the probability increases after all
if you live there and not here.
- I don't hang out with him.
- Who are you with?
That intellectual bastard,
the Chilean Javier?
Hang up!
I can actually think for myself.
People in the world starve and don't have
even clean water and it's war...
- Rent vatten?
- Ja.
- What?
- Yes exactly.
- Where are you going?
- Yes...
There are no chemicals
here at all.
It is pure rainwater.
I pour in here and there
it passes through a simple carbon filter.
And then everything is cleaned with
a UV lamp that is in here.
Ove! Is this
he sits and presses?
- Who then?
- Dad.
The chick...
Fredrik, how nice to see you!
You, I just want to clear up for you-
- that I want
that you leave Viktor alone.
Why are you sneaking around
and brainwash him?
- Stop, "brainwashers"...
- He sounds like a fucking voter!
Ove? What do you say
about arranging a cup of coffee?
- Sure. Black or white?
- I don't want coffee.
I'll take it black. -I have only
read some homework with Viktor.
And we have had
very interesting conversations.
Why are you sneaking around
behind my back?
I have tried to talk to you.
You never have time.
I have a family to take care of.
And how are you yourselves,
Mikaela and you? Are you having a good time?
I want you to leave my son alone!
- What are you doing this summer?
- Huh?
I would like you to come down
to Torekov and visited.
Leave Viktor alone.
Nice! Good!
Well done Alex! Nice.
This is unacceptable to me.
Good there! Damn, how hot you are!
Damn, what a flow!
- It's calm.
- Is it good? Sorry, Alex.
- Are you angry?
- No absolutely not.
I had no idea
that it was David Grimborg.
I thought it was a flume spear
and then there was David.
- Pulled pork till Alex.
- Ja.
- Tasty meal.
- Thanks.
- Shouldn't you have something?
- No, I've finished lunch.
- No, I've finished lunch.
- No problem.
I understand you had a great time.
He's a damn nice dude.
- Do you think?
- Yes unfortunately.
I wish he was an idiot,
it would have been easier-
- but now he is not.
Listen, drop it.
- The old bastard is back.
- Mauritz?
Apparently there are some doctor's appointments.
I guess he doesn't trust the healthcare
in Maputo, I guess.
- Lives at Ove Sundberg's house.
- Huh? Why?
They have always had a good eye
to eachother. Shit looking for shit.
Now he brainwashes Viktor. Hope
well he's going to be an engineer when I cheated.
But who left home
to Mozambique-
- and screw some aid worker from
Helsingor? How solidarity was it?
Now he wants us to go to his
summer cottage and reconcile.
- Do you want that one?
- You are welcome.
It must have been empty when Kirsten left.
Now he wants to get into the heat again.
- You can take the rest if you want.
- Nice.
I think you should take the chance
before it is too late.
I remember with mom.
There was a lot that we could
talked about like we never did.
- You talked every day.
- But it was everyday talk the whole time.
We talked about the hibiscus
and the kalops would be mixed...
The galop that was to be mixed?
After all, she had IBS, irritable colon.
Inflamed colon.
She got constipated and so
it spread down into the ampulla recti and...
So it was damn messy there
for her to go to school and...
Are you done already? Okay...
- You? Are you meeting someone?
- No, I do not.
We are going to the country on Saturday.
Do you want to join?
- Okay. Maybe.
- Back and forth over the day only.
Can you get the sprint there?
- Excuse me?
- Yes?
- The seller is here.
- He can make an appointment.
It's that girl.
You, you know... I...
I'll be right back.
I should have told you about Uffe,
but...
So... We don't meet anymore.
- He said you were together.
- No.
- Me.
- Yes, I...
I might
has not been completely clear-
- and said properly
that it was over. But now we have...
- We have...
- Finished, right?
Yes indeed. Just.
I don't know how you feel but I…
If you can imagine
to go to the cinema again-
-I would love to.
- Okay...
- I understand if you don't feel like it.
But it was fun to... We...
Sorry.
- Hello, Fred!
- Hey!
- This is Bella. Peace.
- Hello.
- Hello. Peace.
- Bella.
- Is it okay that she hangs up?
- Yes absolutely. Absolutely.
- Is Mickan here?
- Yes.
- Ship off, Alex.
- Alex plus one, Bella.
- Hello. Bella.
- Mikaela Schiller. Nice.
- Hey. Alex.
- Hey, Alex. Potzie.
- Rose sword.
- Yes exactly. It was a long time ago.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
- Self?
- Yes, it's actually great.
- How is Tobbe?
- We have separated.
It is separate. So that it is separate.
Me too, actually.
I'm divorced too...
Shall we throw away
so we move on?
- Shall I throw something?
- I do it.
- Do you want help?
- No.
Is it okey?
- Cheers, then.
- Cheers!
How good with honey for the chèvre.
Wonder if it's not starting to come
little rain cloud. It builds on little.
- But it's your week, right?
- Yes I know.
I was thinking... If only
can take the weekend, to...
Then I leave Friday afternoon...
Yes, until Sunday.
- Where are you going?
- Venice.
- Yes. Is it a conference?
- No, it's a pleasure trip.
Okay.
A little amusement park of your own, right?
Wilma, can you see
what is Love doing out in the garden?
Is it okey? Check for him. Thanks.
It's with a girl.
- Her name is Bella.
- God, what fun!
Dude, so... It's great fun.
It's absolutely fantastic.
It was delightful.
Yes actually. It is very lovely.
Who is this Bella, then?
Yes, God... She's cute. Really cute.
Very nice and she is kind.
The kind I like.
And...
- But it works, do you think?
- Sure.
Oh thats fun.
- She sounds... Does she have children, or?
- No. She doesn't have that.
It seems
like he's in love with Bella.
- Damn, what fun.
- As long as it doesn't go too fast.
He is already talking about us going
sell now and move apart for real.
But is it true? How fun. Funny.
- Yes, it will be a completely new mode.
- Yes.
I've already started sneak peeking
in an apartment in Igelboda.
- Igelboda is absolutely perfect, isn't it.
- Yes actually.
It is extremely close to Solsidan,
just a few stations.
- We can go there and check?
- Yes, but do it.
What "does it"? Self?
- We'll do that together anyway, right?
- I live here.
Where should I live then?
You can be here, if you want. We can
be here, or somewhere else.
This is a hobbit house after all.
15 square meters on wheels for an entire family.
We noticed how fun the kids are
thought it was coming here.
They like this. What did you say?
That they don't have to grow up
in that bubble in Solsidan.
On Solsidan, it says.
But what are you talking about.
No, we're not going down to grandpa's!
- Why not?
- Because it's... complicated.
Sometimes, if one has
a very big conflict-
- can it be best
not to be seen at all.
Don't you want to meet grandpa
before he dies?
- Well, it's clear.
- He does it at any time.
- Uh! We should all do that.
- No, Fredde, not everyone does that at all.
- Not at the same time anyway.
- Then I'll go to Torekov myself.
- What did you say now?
- Huh?
Did you say Torekov?
Does he have a summer house in Torekov?
He comes?
Has Mauritz
a summer house in Torekov?!
Here we have kayaked around
between Aix-en-Provence-
- Hong Kong and Miami
every damn summer-
-and your father has a house in Torekov!
House and house, it's a cabin.
You have lied to me
for 15 fucking years, Fredrik!
Everyone is in Torekov over the summer.
You know that, Fredrik!
Sorry if I have disappointed you.
I try to avoid my father.
I may have missed...
say 3600 drinks!
- Do you go there for drinks?
- Do not play dumb.
- You must move in the right texture.
- "Texture"?
Context, outline... Your father is
dying, no time to punctuate!
Viktor has seen him eat the Item,
everyone at that age does.
All doctor visits, then? And that he
all of a sudden comes to Sweden.
Your commitment to his health
is admirable, but I'm not going!
You don't have to, honey,
but I will go with the children.
I'm going to Torekov. Are you coming?
- Why are you doing that?
- Huh?
Why are you doing that?
Torekov is little
like Alice in Wonderland.
Everything is the opposite. Down there
is it nice to have old things.
- But those are new.
- I know honey.
- It's our home page, okay? Hello?
- Yes!
This wasn't that small after all.
It's great, you can live here.
Yes, but that's not where we live.
Wait, Fred! What are you doing down here?
- Lives with dad.
- Okay.
Næn, næn... Hello, welcome!
Victor. Mikaela,
you can't believe your eyes.
This is how grandpa does it. What are you saying?
It's a bit crowded,
but you are mostly out running.
- Yes.
- Here you can sit and eat.
And over here we have the kitchen.
Grandfather? Should I sleep here?
No, I sleep there.
- Where do we sleep anywhere?
- You will sleep here.
Yes, it's just for spreading out.
- There is the kitchen, there you can spread out.
- I heard that.
- What do we do with the potty tonight?
- You can have it.
I go outside and pee.
Now we have discussed a little
back and forth-
- and arrived
to that adoption we can forget.
Completely excluded. It will be too much
to buy the pig in the sack.
But on the other hand, if Anette is a mother-
- half the pig is out of the bag,
so to speak.
Sperm donation
is definitely a way to go.
Of course we can join
and choose a donor?
So, eye color, hair color
and length and so on.
- Spirit.
- Oh, already. I have to order wine.
How good.
Do you have someone who looks like...?
The important thing is well
that we have a child who is healthy?
Of course. But shall I cough up
a small fortune-
- do I want a child
with a bit of "the Ove-looks".
Otherwise it is not
economically justifiable.
If it doesn't have to cost anything, then?
- Hello, David!
- Hello.
Anette Sundberg,
and this is my husband Ove.
Well, it is so that we have
a little question here.
- Anna is not at home.
- Yeah.
It was actually you
we wanted to talk to.
We wonder if you could
thinking of becoming a sperm donor?
Lucky you didn't have a mouth
full of water, then you only had...
Sperm donor? Okay...
- Yes, it is a somewhat unusual question.
- Yes a little.
After all, we can't have children
in the usual way.
Then I came...
Or, we, to think of you.
Yes. Okay.
You seem like a good person...
differently.
Unfortunately, we cannot offer
some financial compensation.
And some proper penetration
will not occur.
- No... What would it look like?
- Yes...
How is it
with the disease pattern in the family?
It's for the hell of it
nothing to think about?
They asked for help.
It's Ove and Anette we're talking about!
Do you know Ove and Anette?
I do. I don't want
share a man with Anette.
Not with anyone at all.
But calm down, what's the matter?
What is "the thing"?
I will tell you about that.
Do you give a single sperm to Anette,
I'm leaving and not coming back.
That's "the thing".
Am I unclear in some way?
Yes, a little...
No, I understand. No sperm.
- Morning. Slept well?
- Yes
- What time is it?
- Seven.
Time for the morning dip.
- Is he kidding?
- No, it is mandatory here.
I know, but should one
need to bathe in the middle of the night?
You might rather lie down
and sniff the mattress?
Feel the summer cottage smell.
- Shall I help you?
- No. It's fine, stop.
- And then there comes a boy...
- Don't even think about it.
Yes Yes. I'll go out, then.
Also...
Shabby chic? I feel me
more shabby. Like a pounder.
Call it what you will,
that's the way it is down here.
Have you seen that property...?
No. There is Annika. Annika? Hello.
- Mikaela Schiller.
- Hello. Annika.
- When did you come down?
- We have been here all summer.
Great. It's the best,
to be down here all summer.
I have a little drink on Saturday
if you want to come?
- No, it is for Annika. Hello?
- Thank you very much, hello.
How nice, see you there then.
Oh, she is so very cute,
I think.
- Guys, wait a minute. Stop.
- Stop, come back.
- Good morning.
- Oh my God. Here.
Torekov rules apply here.
Now listen, Ebba.
If it says slippers there, it is
Torekov's red light, one might say.
Then you must not go out.
If there are no slippers, it is green.
That's a bit like that here in Torekov.
But God, wait. Hello, I have
a drink on Saturday, do you want to come?
Yes, now it's our turn. Finally.
I don't think I want to bathe,
it seems so cold.
- You don't need to bathe.
- But I want to swim.
Well then. Come on.
When I was a boy
we had swimming school on this jetty.
Mick? Mick?!
- Yes, but how nice.
- Mickey!
- I'm going to swim.
- Yes Yes. God, help...
My God, those were the times.
Whoops...
Oj...
I bang.
Huh? Yes, but you can keep
swimming trunks on. It is okay.
- I don't feel like it right now.
- You do as you wish.
- Aren't you going to swim?
- I've been swimming in Stockholm since.
Healthy here you!
- Is this so good for you?
- What?
I heard
that maybe you weren't feeling so well.
- Who said that?
- Victor.
Is it serious?
Are you going to die, dad?
I have had a couple of small heart attacks,
nothing dangerous.
- Not?
- No.
It is one chamber
who fusses a bit.
They call it atrial flutter.
Flutter, flutter...
I might get a pacemaker.
Why haven't you said anything?
I didn't want you to feel
you forced to come and visit.
I wanted you to come
of their own free will.
- Hello! Are you ready soon?
- Take it easy, dammit!
Fredrik. We go up and buy
buns and cooks breakfast. Come on.
- Of course you should taste the buns.
- I'm not that hungry.
- You haven't had breakfast.
- I'll solve this with food.
- Henrik? Earn!
- Bye Bye.
- When did you come down?
- We have been here for a while now.
Oh, that's the best,
to have been here for a while.
First came the Bohemians,
then came the academics.
Now the capitalists have
and the celebrities took over.
Capitalist? What is it?
One who lives
on other people's work.
How?
You buy a company,
and that's how you buy people's time-
- so you don't have to work yourself.
You don't have to have anything in your head -
- just a hell of a lot of money,
it is enough.
So damn tired of this.
So god damn less on this!
One moment he wants to be reconciled,
then the fucking girls come!
Darling,
Aren't you a little oversensitive?
Yes! He has been so
since high school!
Since I bought my Cavalier bag
and joined MUF!
- I think you need to eat something.
- Don't treat me like a child!
He doesn't like me! He wants
just that I should stop being angry!
- What I think he sucks!
- You know what? Quiet.
- Now we're going home.
- No, we really don't.
I have invited
half Torekov for a drink!
- I really like them!
- Not me!
They live in Stockholm the whole time.
Invite them for a drink at home.
- Inte Hugh Grant.
- Hugh Grant?
Hugh Grant.
Bor i Notting Hill, vet du.
In the summers he lives in Torekov
with his girlfriend whom I have emailed.
Yes, stand there and sigh.
You don't screw this up for me.
- Aren't you a little selfish now?
- Can you take care of me sometime?
- Or the children or your father?
- He doesn't like these people!
- Dad doesn't want any damn drink!
- Well then.
Sorry, didn't mean to
to eavesdrop.
- I'll be happy to get you a drink, please.
- How nice. Cool!
- May I add a couple of names?
- Absolutely.
Hello! Hello, golden chicks!
Oh, come on!
Don't play with those.
Those are more to look at, you know.
- Are you going to marry Bella?
- No, that...
We've just met and stuff.
You get what happens,
but I think she's very cute.
Are you going to put those on the shelf
in your room instead?
I agree.
I think she's weird. A weird girl.
- "Rar"?
- She feels happy and open.
- She has a nice energy.
- Yes.
I think so
and it's clear you've missed it.
Then I get a little surprised, Alex.
You would never
go back to Venice.
- Did I say that?
- You remember that, right?
The food was wrong,
it smelled bad...
Do you remember that gondolier
did you bother?
Man with straw hat and striped sweater
who sang "Amore".
Well, he was very dorky.
But I still thought it was actually
very nice when we were there now.
- It felt like something else.
- Yes, of course you thought so.
You have changed company.
It always cheers you up.
Unlike us.
We were like that vinaigrette.
You have to beat it properly
so that it does not cut itself.
- It is layered.
- Yeah.
Lemon in milk, for example, cuts itself.
- It was a metaphor.
- A vinaigrette doesn't cut itself...
Shut up and whip. For real.
It feels good with David
and so now, right?
- Yes, it feels good.
- How fun.
I thought more
if we were to move on and so on.
- What do you mean?
- With selling the house and stuff like that.
Yes, we have to do that. Really.
Start thinking about how we should divide
the stuff too, what you want...
- Exactly. You can take what you want.
- I feel the same way.
It's nothing that I have to have.
In itself, the green agency,
I love it.
- Do you?
- I would love to have it.
- Unless you feel that you...
- No, take it. Obvious.
It really is you. I do love...
I don't know,
I love nothing maybe.
Or, I kind of love everything.
- Huh?
- It's a Christmas present from you.
"Now you don't have to beg
for herewith you may lie"-
- "with me, any time and place"-
- "all included, foreplay,
hängel and sats." How filthy.
Did you have to be so dirty?
- "Merry Christmas, Wishing you Alex."
- God, when is it from?
2014.
So maybe it has expired now?
Yes, you can leave it alone
to drown now in the archipelago.
Yes, I shouldn't have to do that.
We can be contacted during the week, right?
- You, I have changed electricity companies too.
- Yeah? How nice.
I thought
that it might be too late-
- but it was a great deal.
This is how autogiro works.
And...
Then you may have a good week, then.
Yes. The same.
And thanks for the food,
it was really good.
It was great fun.
It's nice when you can have these
a little cozier the handovers so...
And...
Bye then.
- Hello.
- Bye.
- What should...?
- Yes, what the hell...
Where is David?
At the Wilderness Fair.
Okay.
You, I'm a little thirsty.
- Shall I get some water?
- No. I will fix it.
- Hello, hello!
- Ciao, bello.
- Do you have time to talk a little?
- Absolutely...
- You, Anna are still here.
- No, sorry. Sorry.
No, it was...
We had some things to fix.
But she's leaving soon, so…
- Are you longing for me then, aren't you?
- Yes, lots.
- Should we do something about it then, or not?
- Absolutely.
One can do
any favorites like this in reruns?
- May I call you in a little while?
- Okay. Kiss.
Kiss Kiss Kiss.
- You, Anna...
- It's calm, Alex.
- I feel exactly the same.
- Do you?
Yes. So, we like each other,
it's just the way it is.
But we already tried
to live together, it doesn't work.
No, we whipped damn hard
while we were at it.
Yes, we did.
Maybe we just needed this now.
One last time to get
some kind of end to it all.
So it may be.
- We may not have to...
- No, no...
We...
I know, it's a bit short pucks
but he wants you to come.
It's a nostalgic thing,
he thinks back.
But then, I don't understand.
Is the drink in... Torekov?
I'm in Stockholm now.
I don't want to be here either but
Mickan has painted me into a corner.
Me and Bella
have some plans here with the kids.
Bring them.
I offer hotel and rubbet.
Such an opportunity
we can't miss.
They offer travel, food and accommodation.
When do you participate in it?
No no no! Marielle!
Damn... You shouldn't press
on that button!
- You should press the one next to it!
- Now it says "gift". We'll fix it.
I'm not mad at you,
but on the system.
You cannot have the buttons at child height!
You cannot set a sosse button
at child height!
This innocent creature has
never been subjected to a tax pressure.
She doesn't know what it means
that one's money goes to something else-
- than what you yourself want!
- Can't you take this somewhere else?
- She owes us 22 kroner.
What do you want us to do?
Go away?
Have a third button:
"Shoot me in the head!"
- What is the problem?
- That it pours in people.
We agreed on 100,
now it says over 300 here.
- Hey!
- Hey, Mauritz!
- Everything alright?
- Very good thanks.
- Alex, do you have a second?
- Okay...
Are you watching the kids, honey?
Honey, it's not that bad.
I am forced to sleep with the whole
the situation. Do I have to like it too?
- Lena. Welcome.
- Thank you.
- Hello! Oh, how nice!
- Nice to be here.
- When did you come down?
- A week ago.
It is the best. Then you have
the whole summer ahead.
Let this marinate a bit.
But not for long-
- because Anette will soon ovulate.
- Tuesday, likely.
- I understand...
It's just that I kind of feel…
Consider it an honor.
We don't ask just anyone.
- Only David.
- Have you asked him?
Yes, but he said no. Unfortunately.
- I understand him...
- Can I talk to Alex in a private room?
Well, let me just…
- You must help me.
- Yes, but...
"But"? Alex "But" Löfström,
I thought we were polar opposites.
Yes, but we are Poles.
I'm crazy about Bella.
- But what does she have to do with it?
- She's my girlfriend.
She might want to have children one day.
If I get involved in some fucking...
You don't think she wants to?
I'm pretty much bombproof
that she doesn't want to. -Peace?
- Mode?
- Well... Take care, dammit.
- Ove is sperm hunting.
- Sperm hunting?
- Yes.
- What? What do you mean?
This is going to be great.
Completely untouched.
I was here in November myself
for three weeks.
- I didn't see a jaw. Absolutely incredible.
- Fantastic...
Strange that no one
have discovered the place.
It's going to be a mess later.
So I think we'll pitch the tent
in a written up here.
So we make a little fire, braze a little jaw.
I'm getting a little hungry.
Check this out.
My old fireplace is still here.
It feels like it
rolling in very fast, this.
Shouldn't we just set up the tent now
so have we done it?
When they were talking about the donation thing
it set off thoughts for me.
- My head started spinning.
- Yeah. Okay.
Maybe it's the biological clock
which starts ringing.
Yes maybe.
It would be cool to have my own children, but I
also want to continue with this.
It gets a bit complicated, of course.
With jungle and mountain climbing then.
I met some Poles at the fair.
They will paddle across the Atlantic.
- But what the hell... In a plastic boat?
- No. Carbon fiber.
- But please, David. For real.
- No, no...
The problem is stabilizing the kayak
to sleep, but they have solved it.
- How nice!
- Yes, that's great.
- They have a system of wires...
- Hear how you sound!
You don't mean
that you will do it?
- Haven't decided. What do you think?
- That it sounds completely idiotic!
You can die walking on the street.
So why go out
in a plastic boat on the Atlantic-
-if you can jump in front of a bus?
Nothing in life is risk-free.
I usually think like this:
Biggest risk you can take
is to take no risks at all.
That's what I think. Crying is
at the risk of getting sentimental.
To extend one hand to another-
- is to risk getting involved.
To live is to risk dying.
Are you sitting and pulling the end clip
at your lecture now?
And.
So you have no problem
with Alex donating?
Say exactly how you feel.
Alex is my best friend.
- You can be completely straight.
- Yes, but...
So, if he wants it
I can't...
- Are you kidding?
- No, he has asked David along.
Alex was apparently secondary-
the option. Pretty weird though.
If you want good genes, then there are
the more natural places to look.
I had said no. Who wants to be related
with Ove and Anette?
But objectively speaking
should one go for the option-
- which gives the child
best ability to survive.
- And you are?
- If you look in the assessment calendar.
- What the hell?
- You have invited Lussan?
No absolutely not.
Have you invited Richard Båge,
is that her new one?
I don't know! I will...
Are you listening? Mickey!
Hi Freddie. Nice to see you.
Wait, Fred.
- Where is Mickan?
- She... I don't know, she...
Let it be.
It rains, it washes itself.
Yes, I feel it.
- Can I help you with something?
- No.
If I hold up the tent maybe
it is faster to get the stick in-
- so we can get in.
Because we are going to swim naked in Torekov
And live life without sorrow
We will bathe naked so everyone can see
It is noticeable that you have not been together
especially long with Bella.
What have you said?
That is okay with you,
is it ok for me
- Do you even talk to each other?
- Yes, but...
I interpret this to mean that we
has a green light. Green side up.
No, wait...
I can see in your eyes that you don't want to.
Wait, what are you doing now?
- We have an agreement.
- Bella...
- Maybe it's you who doesn't want to?
- Now we're talking about Bella.
I don't know...
This fear of conflict.
Do we want it to spread
on our child?
He dare not say no,
he blames her.
Do we want a child like that?
Sauteed pork! We have spilled
several hours on the wrong horse!
- I saw Aje Philipson over here.
- Is it true?
- Hej, Ove Sundberg.
- Bathina Philipson.
Yes, I know that. Hello. Ove Sundberg.
I have a small question.
That's why I push myself.
It may seem a bit direct,
but my wife and I...
I'm so tired of everyone
these bachelor bananas here.
- Okay.
- Ness, so...
You Mediterraneans, you have one more
relaxed approach to life.
Thanks for that, what a compliment.
Can you imagine
to donate your sperm?
- Nah...
- It was funny.
- Can't you just leave here?
- Go yourself!
- Stick from here.
- Stick yourself!
- I will be really unpleasant.
- Yes, you are already quite unpleasant.
Oh stop it! We are standing and talking.
If what,
which is more important than a child?
- So it's dead? There will be nothing?
- Stone dead.
- Hello?
- Hello?
Huh? Hello?
- Are you all right?
- Yes, we are fine.
- You can't hear very well here.
- There is a little rain and debris here.
It's a really bad line.
Was it important
or can i call you later?
I miss you.
I miss you!
I hear you. But, you... You know what?
What happened between us
Maybe it wasn't a goodbye?
Maybe it was a new start for us,
this?
Yeah, but you know what, I…
Hello?
You know, I've chosen Bella now.
But "selected", it's not an electricity company, is it?
You either love someone or you don't.
It's not something you choose.
Do you love her?
Is this some fucking interrogation?
Yes, I am in love with her, yes.
I am.
But please Alex,
she is very sweet and weird and nice-
- but now I'm talking about the two of us here.
You and I.
But damn, how are you supposed to be?
Just now you said we don't
could live together longer.
But you can be wrong, right?
I was wrong, Alex.
And now you're right, then?
I just feel
that I still love you.
I love my warm,
please, good dentists.
Why did you leave him, then?
- I was so tired of all the conflicts.
- They still exist for the hell of it.
I'm pretty busy, Alex,
and you're pretty square too.
But we have to learn to live with that.
We love each other, that's right
yet what is most important here?
But you know what, this...
This doesn't work, dammit.
You can't leave me and
come back at your convenience.
It doesn't work, dammit.
I want to live with Bella now.
- No, you don't want that!
- What do you know about it?
Do you want to be with someone
who buys seahorses in venice?
Surely it's not a human
that makes it?
Well, at least she wasn't unfaithful.
This is exactly what
does
that I can't live with you.
There's fighting all the damn time.
You argue all the time, damn it.
I don't like it. It's not possible.
We'll talk about the kids later. Bye.
Are you awake?
I think you should
this Atlantic paddling.
Now that this wire
has become so damn stable.
It will probably be great for you. You can
take the opportunity to donate a little out there.
Spread your seed at sea. Huh?
Then I think we should take and
screw this too, honestly.
Good night.
Good, thanks, thanks! Stop drumming,
now it will be a snack here.
- Stick, or...
- What the hell is this? Is he drunk?
First some praise.
Peace, Mickan, wherever you are.
Thanks for
this amazing blunder set.
That gets Katthult
to appear as Sudan for the hell of it.
Just reach out,
so thong, you have something in your lab!
- Remove him.
- Why?
- Remove him!
- Me? Baby, that's your drink.
The criticism, then.
You are stingy,
you are stingy, you are stingy!
You stand there with your scrotum full of seed
but don't want to share with you!
Yes, I'm going piss private here,
and it might be touchy-
- for you superficial "lick-ass-
and-kiss-people-on-the-cheek".
But Anette and I
out of sauce for the pasta.
My sauce has cut itself!
And I have asked 14 men
here tonight-
- and everyone has said no!
- Anette is ovulating as we speak!
- Ove, you know what?
Keep that in mind when you add the sauce
between the bridges of the houses.
That Anette had that sauce
could have had in the clutch!
Burn, motherfuckers!
- Ouch!
- Mick, sorry. How did it go?
- Can I have ice cream?
- Is it more pity for her now?
Then something is terribly wrong.
Is her lip sore
worth more than a child's life?
Can you just get off the stage?!
Think about it, you bastards
spermatozoa. I'm out.
Are you sure we shouldn't call anyone?
- How is it?
- Too damn.
Hello. Are you here?
Yes, thanks for a...
really super nice drink.
- How nice that you came.
- I'm going to the car.
You, I'm so sorry
if I was scratchy.
- Sorry.
- No, I'm the one to say sorry.
- No!
- Yes, it's me who rubs.
- You have never been scratchy.
- You are never scratchy!
- Honey, you're not scratchy.
- You never rub!
- Neither do you.
- Do not you think?
- Oh, Lussan. I love you.
- And I love you.
- Vi ses i stan sen.
- Ha.
But I wouldn't go
so fast if I were you.
Do you know who might be on the way?
Hugh Grant.
Hughie? No he is not.
We're going to a party
to him and Anna now.
I'll call you later and tell you everything.
Kiss. -Bye, Freddie.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- Now we go home to Solsidan.
- Yes, we do, damn it.
- Take care, Mikaela.
- Yes.
- Hello, kids.
- Hello, grandfather!
Frederick...
I want to thank you especially-
- for visiting,
it has meant a lot to me.
And so it is
one more thing i have to say.
It's a bit difficult, but…
Now that you have children of your own,
maybe you can imagine-
- how it would feel if they found
themselves on the other side of the globe?
That's bad enough. But... that they
is located very close-
- and that you still don't
can reach each other-
-it's worse.
You know that... the more the years have passed-
- that's how I've thought about my life
and the choices that I have made.
And...
All parents may want
trying to find himself in his children.
That they will become like us.
But it's not meant to
the children must please the parents.
No, they must go their own way.
Just as you have done.
Can you forgive me...
for all that I have done?
Or, not done.
I love you, Fredrik.
Shall we say so then, perhaps?
See you in Stockholm then, maybe?
Darling,
Aren't you going to go out and just...?
How does it feel?
Yes, but...
You know, there's a thing that's happened-
-as I have to tell you.
Yeah, what?
That... Me and Anna, we...
A few weeks ago so...
...I slept with Anna.
I just want to say that it was
stupid I'm really sorry.
It meant nothing.
It was really...
I felt nothing.
It was like sleeping with...
That man... That we just lay there.
It was like, you know...
I understand if you're mad at me.
- No...
- What do you mean?
No, but...
What matters is what you feel.
If it doesn't mean anything
for you then...
Then it means nothing to me either.
- But are you serious? Do you mean it?
- Yes absolutely. Really.
And...
You are so wise.
It was still some kind of reconciliation.
- Do you think?
- Yes, but...
Even if you didn't meet.
- It was a farewell anyway.
- Yes...
He will never
get to meet his dad!
- Who...?
- The little one!
The little one?
As you know, Anette and I sat
a little sticky this summer.
But then the hero came and...
Yes, we are pregnant.
- Papa?
- Yes.
You will have a little brother.
So we will become family.
Yeah...
He lived at our house.
And after Torekov we asked-
- and he thought it was...
a great idea.
- He had a heart condition!
- Yes, we noticed that.
But he had a very nice death,
a real banger ending.
You would see what he looked like.
He was completely clean.
- In a very beautiful way.
- This is insane.
The main thing is that Mauritz
lives on, inside me!
- No, come...
- It is fantastic!
Fredrik, we can take a look later
in the White Archive -
- if it says something about the family house.
In Torekov.
- Not now, Ove.
- Should Ove have it?
We'll take it later.
- Should Ove have the house?
- I do not know.
What is it, Bella?
- You know that thing you told me?
- Yes.
- I have done the same thing.
- Yes...
It didn't mean anything either,
but Uffe how very sad.
I couldn't say no.
What the hell are you saying?
Did you sleep with Uffe because he was sad?
- Yes! A few times.
- Some times?
Oh...
I didn't mean to tell you this.
But then when you told me,
I felt so awful-
- and then... I felt
that I just have to tell you.
We have actually done the same thing.
It was...
Mine and Anna's were a Christmas present.
She got a card from me a few years ago
then with rhymes and stuff-
- and then we had forgotten it, so
she found it and then she wanted...
- What?
- Yes, she kind of wanted to redeem it.
A pat is a pat.
I can't say:
"No, I have promised
but now you don't get..."
Or you could say that, but...
Damn, this is not a good idea...
Sorry, but we've been with our exes.
It's not a good start.
Are you breaking up?
- Sorry.
- No, I understand.
It's great,
i feel the same way.
Do you? How nice.
- Very nice.
- Yes.
Hello there!
Do you have a whisk at home?
Yes, I have.
We'll probably have to use an electric whisk for a while.
Are you sure you want this?
No.
- I have missed you.
- The same.
But here then,
couldn't we go here?
- Thanks, dad.
- Merry Christmas.
You are not afraid
that he turns bright red?
You can fertilize properly now so
beats it earlier. Lex Aschberg.
- But the week after that?
- Thanks thanks.
I received a Christmas greeting
from Ove and Anette here.
Oh... How does it feel, then?
And...
About that... Mickan taught me
a good thing, how should I think.
It was Anna
who taught me from the beginning.
You know, if it were to come
a hard feeling-
- should you just say:
"fuck off, annoying feeling!"
So that it just...
Yeah... It wasn't quite like that,
but there is something in it.
- I think it sounds great.
- It's fucking good.
- Fuck off, annoying feeling!
- Yes...
- God jul. Och fuck off.
- Fuck off.
And when will the brawl come, then?
When does it pop out, so to speak?
