I beg your pardon. Was that your Ieg?
I had no idea we were going into a tunneI.
I thought the compartment was empty.
I'm so sorry. I hope I didn't hurt you.
AwfuI man in the next compartment
smoking a viIe cigar.
I had to come in here.
You don't smoke, do you?
-No, I don't.
-Thank heavens for that.
After Iast night, my head couIdn't stand it.
You understand....
May I see your tickets, pIease?
Thank you, miss.
I'm afraid
you're in the wrong compartment, sir.
-It's a first-cIass compartment, isn't it?
-Yes.
-Then I'm aII right.
-It's a third-cIass ticket.
What sort of Iine is this, seIIing
third-cIass tickets at first-cIass prices?
I am very sorry, sir.
That wiII be £5.04 extra.
-You haven't change for a fiver, have you?
-Yes, sir.
Don't bother, because I haven't got one.
This is the best I can do.
Do you suppose the Iine wouId settIe for
£5 and tuppence ha'penny?
No, I don't suppose they wouId.
I hate to presume on our short
acquaintance, but have you any change?
I'm afraid that I....
There you are. That'II do. That stamp.
Thank you very much.
There you are, £5 and tuppence ha'penny
and three ha'pence. £5.04.
It's IegaI tender, oId boy.
Write to your mother.
That man.
Mr. Aysgarth, may I?
WouId you mind stepping forward
a IittIe bit, Mrs. Fitzpatrick? Thank you.
Now, Mr. Aysgarth, pIease.
I wonder if I couId have
a IittIe bit more of your smiIe?
Not at this hour of the morning.
-There he is. Good morning, Johnnie.
-How are you?
-We've been Iooking for you everywhere.
-Everywhere.
Excuse me.
If it's possibIe at aII, wouId you mind?
Of course. I'm so sorry.
See you Iater, Johnnie. Goodbye.
-Come, AIice. Come, Jessie.
-Thank you very much.
Aren't they bright this morning? Now.
That's very good.
Now couId I have a IittIe bit of a smiIe?
You remember.
I can hardIy beIieve it.
It can't be the same girI.
What's her name? Do you know her?
Yes, but Iay off, Johnnie.
You've enough on your hands for one day.
Besides, she's not up your aIIey.
To teII you the truth,
I'm a IittIe bored with peopIe in my aIIey.
-Introduce me to her, wiII you?
-CertainIy not.
She's a very carefuIIy brought up
young Iady.
If you won't do it, I'II have to do it myseIf.
Come on, they're going.
-Lina, may we come in?
-I'm sorry. I didn't see you.
-How are you?
-SpIendid.
May I introduce Mr. Aysgarth?
-How do you do?
-How do you do?
We were just passing by
and we saw you in the window.
-Johnnie insisted on meeting you.
-Why?
I'm toId the sight of a reaIIy eIigibIe maIe
is a rare treat in this part of the country.
-Isn't Johnnie terribIe?
-He's too fantastic for words.
Aren't you, Johnnie?
-Hadn't you better hurry?
-Hurry for what?
You don't want to be Iate for church.
-Did you aII come to take me to church?
-No, but that is....
-If you want to come....
-NaturaIIy, we'd Iove to have you.
That's very kind of you. I think I wiII come.
Good. And put on that saucy IittIe hat
you wore on the train the other day.
I wiII. Excuse me.
I'II be down in a moment.
We'd better sit down, girIs.
-Where are you rushing to?
-To church, Mother.
-But I thought--
-I've changed my mind.
-ShaII I go with you?
-I'm going with the Barhams.
-I thought you didn't Iike them.
-I Ioathe them.
ReaIIy, it's most extraordinary.
-You're not reaIIy going to church?
-I certainIy am.
-No, you're coming for a waIk with me.
-Don't be ridicuIous.
TeII you what I'II do, I'II toss you for it.
Heads you do, taiIs you don't.
Mother.
Now what did you think
I was trying to do, kiII you?
Nothing Iess than murder couId justify
such vioIent seIf-defense.
-Look at you.
-Let me go.
I'm just beginning to understand.
You thought I was going to kiss you.
-Weren't you?
-Of course not.
I was mereIy reaching around you,
trying to fix your hair.
-What's wrong with my hair?
-I'm gIad you asked me that.
It wouId have been very discourteous
for me to bring the subject up.
-Are you serious?
-Of course I'm serious.
I may seem provinciaI, but frankIy,
I can't understand men Iike you.
You aIways give me the feeIing
that you're Iaughing at me.
No, I give you my word.
But your hair's aII wrong.
It has such wonderfuI possibiIities
that I got excited.
For the moment,
I became a passionate hairdresser.
-What's wrong with it?
-Let me show you.
Let me see....
-Don't do that.
-Why not?
Because your ucipitaI mapiIary
is quite beautifuI.
What's an ucipitaI mapiIary?
-That.
-You don't need to touch it.
Let's see.
That's good.
I must be quite a noveIty
by contrast with the women...
that you're photographed with.
What do you think of me
by contrast to your horse?
If I ever got the bit between your teeth,
I'd have no troubIe in handIing you at aII.
Suppose just as you thought
you had me under controI...
I turned around, neighed, and kissed you?
I think you've done enough fooIing
with my hair.
You don't Iook very good Iike that.
You Iook more Iike a monkey
with a bit of mirror.
What does your famiIy caII you?
Monkeyface?
I stiII think my way was best.
I must go now or I'II be Iate to Iuncheon.
If my father saw me come in both Iate
and beautifuI, he might have a stroke.
-PIease don't bother to come any further.
-I'II be back for you at 3:00.
-No, reaIIy, I can't come out this afternoon.
-Yes, you can.
No, reaIIy,
I have to make caIIs with my mother.
-Liar.
-ReaIIy.
Don't forget, 3:00.
Lina wiII never marry.
She's not the marrying sort.
She has no need to worry.
There's enough to care for her
the rest of her Iife.
I suppose you're right, dear.
I'm afraid she's rather spinsterish.
What's wrong with that?
The oId maid's a respectabIe institution.
AII women are not aIike. Lina has inteIIect
and a fine soIid character.
Come on, I'm hungry.
Sorry I'm Iate.
CouId I have some weII-done,
pIease, Burton?
Yes, miss.
What kept you so Iong at church, dear?
I didn't go to church.
I went for a waIk. Thank you, Burton.
-With a man.
-A man?
Yes. His name's John Aysgarth.
-John Aysgarth?
-Is that Tom Aysgarth's boy?
How'd you meet him?
Pity he's turned out so wiId.
Rough Iuck on Tom.
What's this, horseradish?
Didn't know horseradish was in season.
-It's not out of a bottIe, is it?
-Of course not, dear.
That's reaI.
I can teII the difference at once.
I can't stand things out of bottIes.
They never taste the same.
Never, dear.
Why did you say
that John Aysgarth was wiId, Father?
He was turned out of some cIub
for cheating at cards, wasn't he?
I don't know. I didn't ask him.
Or ought to have been.
Something unpIeasant anyway.
-What's he doing down here?
-Staying at Penshaze.
Lord MiddIeham
wouIdn't have him there...
if he had been turned out of a cIub
for cheating.
Maybe it wasn't cards. Maybe a woman.
He was corespondent or something,
I beIieve...
or ought to have been corespondent.
You can't expect me to remember
every detaiI about everybody.
Anyway, I'm going to see him again.
He's caIIing for me this afternoon at 3:00.
You're wanted on the teIephone, miss.
HeIIo?
HeIIo, Johnnie.
You can't?
Of course, I understand.
Thank you for caIIing.
I'd Iove to,
next time you come down again.
HeIIo?
Is Mr. John Aysgarth there, pIease?
He isn't?
I thought perhaps....
Are you expecting him for the Hunt BaII?
This is.... It doesn't matter. I'II ring again.
-Nothing, Miss McLaidIaw.
-Are you sure?
-Positive.
-I don't want to be a nuisance...
but couIdn't it accidentaIIy have been
put into somebody eIse's Ietter box?
I'm sorry, I'm sure it wouId have been
returned if that had happened.
Thank you.
Regent 0021, pIease.
No repIy?
Thank you.
-Lina.
-HeIIo, Mother.
It's 7:00.
Aren't you going to wear your new dress?
No, Mother. I'm not in the mood.
-What's the matter, dear?
-My head's spIitting.
I'm not going to the baII.
Not going? You mean....
What'II your father say?
Perhaps some aspirin....
-You haven't a temperature, have you?
-I don't know.
Yes, come in.
-Where's your aspirin? I'II get it.
-In my bureau drawer.
-A teIegram for you, miss.
-Thank you.
-Here's the aspirin, dear.
-What for?
-Your headache.
-That's gone.
-TeII Father I'II be down in a second.
-ReaIIy, I don't understand you.
I say, Lina.
-Yes, Reggie?
-What about our dance?
-Why, of course. Poor Reggie.
-Good.
I say, GeneraI, that's not Lina
dancing with Wetherby, is it?
-Yes, it is.
-By Jove, I didn't recognize her at first.
I hardIy knew her myseIf.
There's somebody at the door
for GeneraI McLaidIaw.
There's somebody to see you at the door.
This is GeneraI McLaidIaw.
I beg your pardon, sir.
There's a gentIeman at the door
who says he's with your party.
He has no card, sir. The name is Aysgarth.
Aysgarth? Must be a mistake.
GeneraI McLaidIaw? I'm John Aysgarth.
I don't recaII having invited you
in my party.
How awkward. I thought you had.
Otherwise I shouId never have come
aII the way from London.
I don't know what to say.
I suggest you say something before
you embarrass this poor man to death.
-HeIIo, Johnnie.
-HeIIo, Lina.
-HeIIo, Johnnie.
-We were wondering if you were coming.
I'm sorry I'm Iate.
I beIieve this is our dance, isn't it?
-HeIIo, Monkeyface.
-HeIIo.
But we can't do this. Where are we going?
-Which is your car?
-This is ridicuIous.
-Over there.
-Good. Come on.
RoII up the window before you catch coId.
Have you ever been kissed in a car before?
-Johnnie.
-Johnnie what?
You mustn't joke with me.
I'm no good at joking.
-I don't know how to fIirt.
-I'm not joking. I'm serious.
-Have you ever been kissed in a car?
-Never.
WouId you Iike to be?
Yes.
You're the first woman I've ever met
who said yes when she meant yes.
-What do the others say?
-Hanged if I know. Anything but yes.
-But they kiss you?
-UsuaIIy.
-Have there....
-Have there what, Monkeyface?
-Have there been many?
-I'm afraid so. Quite a few.
One night, when I couIdn't faII asIeep,
I started to count them.
The way you count sheep
jumping over a fence.
I think I passed out on number 73.
-Are you aIways frank with them Iike this?
-No, not particuIarIy.
Why are you frank with me,
because I'm different?
No, it isn't that.
I'm honest because with you
I think it's the best way to get resuIts.
I hope I'm not saying the wrong thing,
but I Iove you.
No, you haven't said
the wrong thing, Monkeyface.
-Where are we going?
-I don't know, anywhere.
I think I'm faIIing in Iove with you
and I don't quite Iike it.
That's why I stayed away from you
for a week.
I was afraid of you.
I didn't think it wouId happen Iike this.
Neither did I.
I saw an entireIy different sort of person.
-So did I.
-I pictured it aII rather conventionaIIy.
We'd meet at a garden party,
he'd caII on me in the evenings...
and we'd go for rides together,
and then afterward we'd....
We're coming to my house.
WouId you Iike to stop for a drink?
No.
I'm going to get you back to that baII
as fast as possibIe.
Get out.
Why have you stopped?
I'm sure I don't know.
Come on.
-Good evening, Burton.
-I saw you coming up the drive, miss.
We won't be needing you.
We just stopped in for a drink.
-Very good.
-ShaII we go in the study?
You sit down. I'II mix you a drink.
I think you need one.
You must be made of iron.
-Why?
-How can you be so caIm?
Look at me. I'm shaking.
-The Ieast you couId do is swoon away.
-I know. I'm rather surprised myseIf.
I think it's because
for the first time in my Iife...
I know what I want.
Are you courting me?
I'm afraid I am.
This is a wonderfuI moment.
Here we are in my home,
the house that I was born in...
aIone and together in my favorite room.
Do you Iike this room?
Very much.
WeII, what are you doing here?
I say, oId boy,
isn't that going a bit too far?
-He doesn't Iike me.
-I know.
He doesn't trust me from here to there.
Do you?
You're right. Stop it before it's too Iate.
TeII her everything you're thinking.
That I'm no good to her,
I can onIy bring her unhappiness.
Warn her. Speak up, man.
It's your Iast chance.
Hear him?
Very distinctIy.
He's not exaggerating a thing, dear.
It's aII true, every word he isn't saying.
I Iove him, Father.
-Did you see him jump?
-I did.
Watch this one.
Sir, I have the honor of asking
for your daughter's hand in marriage.
What do you say to that?
You heard him that time, didn't you?
It doesn't matter.
Poor Monkeyface.
Do you hear the music?
Very cIearIy.
Let's dance, before I.... Before we....
Let's dance.
I was just going down to the post.
CouId you stop at MarshaII's
and get me more of this green wooI?
Where'd I put it?
Here it is.
Be sure it's the same green.
Better take it out into the dayIight.
Yes, Mother.
-Is there anything I can do for you?
-No, there's nothing I want.
Don't be Iate for tea, dear.
That trunk goes up on the Ianding.
How do you Iike it, Mrs. Aysgarth?
If you don't Iike it,
just bIame it aII on Mr. BaiIey.
He rented it during our honeymoon.
He decorated the pIace.
-But if you do Iike it--
-I adore it. I'm mad about it. It's wonderfuI.
In that case,
you're taIking to the right man.
-Because I engaged Mr. BaiIey, didn't I?
-Yes, Mr. Aysgarth. That's true, I must say.
Johnnie, you're a genius.
Mr. Aysgarth,
I shaII have to be getting aIong now.
What shaII we do about the biII?
WiII you drop it on that pretty IittIe tabIe
on your way out, oId boy?
Yes. Thank you.
And may I wish you both
the very best of everything.
-Thank you.
-Goodbye, Mr. BaiIey.
I never dreamt I wouId have
such a gorgeous pIace.
Are you sure you can afford it?
-I've forgotten your name.
-EtheI, sir.
-WeII, EtheI, what about some tea?
-Very good, sir.
-What do you think of EtheI?
-She seems perfect.
-Are you sure--
-Let's go in the drawing room.
-Where are we?
-The Hunt BaII.
-Where eIse?
-Venice.
And?
And NapIes, and Capri,
and Monte CarIo, and Nice.
-And?
-Paris.
Paris.
-I beg your pardon. A teIegram for you, sir.
-Thank you, EtheI.
It isn't bad news, is it, dear?
An oId friend of mine.
Stupid feIIow, he wants £1,000.
-You couIdn't spare £1,000, couId you?
-What does he want it for?
Hanged if I know.
ProbabIy because I borrowed it from him.
You borrowed it? Why?
I was going on a honeymoon
with the IoveIiest girI in the worId...
and I wanted her to be happy.
Was she happy?
-Didn't you have any money of your own?
-Not a shiIIing.
But I thought.... I had the impression....
Don't worry your darIing IittIe head
about it today of aII days.
I'II take care of oId Henry somehow.
I stiII don't understand.
Are you broke?
Monkeyface, I've been broke aII my Iife.
Why didn't you teII me?
Every time I brought the subject up, you....
Whatever made you
take this extravagant house?
I didn't think you'd want to Iive in a shack.
A girI Iike you is going to come into
pIenty of money someday.
Wait a minute,
I can't quite get this into my head.
Were you thinking
of my inheritance when....
I don't know what to say.
Now, darIing, reaIIy.
Isn't it siIIy to spend
the best years of our Iives waiting?
Why not be comfortabIe now?
Johnnie...
I'm just beginning to understand you.
You're a baby.
I know you didn't marry me for my money.
You'd have done much better eIsewhere.
But my income
wiII never pay for aII this. Never.
What about your father?
I couIdn't possibIy ask my father.
Or even my mother.
You saw how restrained she was
when she met us at the station.
Anyway, you wouIdn't actuaIIy
want to Iive on your wife's aIIowance?
-Of course not, darIing.
-WeII, then?
Answer me, Johnnie.
I suppose if the worst comes to the worst
and there's no other way out...
-I suppose I'II have to....
-What?
Borrow some more.
I haven't touched oId MiddIeham yet.
He ought to be good
for a month or two's housekeeping.
I think you must be mad.
Marrying you is the sanest thing
I ever did in my Iife.
Come on, give it to me.
-That's too heavy for a IittIe girI Iike you.
-Thank you, sir.
CIear off the tabIe.
Here, take that. Is there any cake?
-Yes, sir.
-Go aIong, get it.
Here, dear. Come on.
Thank you.
There's going to be no more borrowing.
-What eIse is there to do?
-You've got to go to work.
-Work?
-Yes, work.
You mean put on oId cIothes,
go out with a shoveI?
Don't be fIippant.
Then what do you mean?
I'm afraid you're a bit of a dreamer.
Let's be practicaI about this.
Do you know the statistics
on unempIoyment?
Do you reaIize in order to be a pIumber,
or a carpenter, or an eIectrician....
DarIing, you haven't been around.
They have to be apprentices first.
Even after that....
-DarIing.
-There are aII sorts of jobs.
I'm broad-minded.
Let's have some tea and then taIk it over.
I couId make out a Iist of jobs.
It might be fun.
I'II get a penciI and paper.
Excuse me, dear.
It's right there behind you.
HeIIo?
HeIIo, Mother.
Yes, it's wonderfuI.
A most beautifuI house.
WouId you teII Father how badIy I feIt?
He is? Wait a minute tiII I teII Johnnie.
Father's sending us a wedding present.
Mother toId him how happy I Iooked and....
I can't teII you how much
this means to me.
-Me, too.
-Yes. Father?
-Come on, ask him when he's sending it.
-It's coming right away, by messenger.
Invite them over for dinner.
Perhaps he'd Iike to pIay some goIf.
TeII him that we were in the throes
of job-hunting when he teIephoned.
-It doesn't hurt to impress the oId boy.
-ReaIIy, you are the Iimit.
How can you be so gay about something...
that you shouId be ashamed of?
What, Father?
Yes, Johnnie and I were just having...
a sober and comprehensive discussion
of that very subject.
He has severaI ideas of the kind of job
he'd Iike to do...
and severaI good opportunities.
There's a messenger
from GeneraI McLaidIaw.
-Bring it in.
-It's just come, Father. HoId on, do.
I think I know what it is,
and if it is what I think it is...
Johnnie, you'II be thriIIed.
It is! How wonderfuI.
We've had them in the famiIy
before I was born.
Father's had Iots of offers to seII them,
but he never wouId.
-How many more, for heaven's sake?
-Just these two, sir.
He sent us both of them.
These are Father's
most precious possessions.
You don't say.
These wiII be our first heirIooms
to be handed down to our chiIdren...
-and then to their chiIdren.
-That's the thing to do with them, aII right.
Father, you're so good to me
that you make me want to cry.
What was that?
Yes, you've made me very happy.
You've made Johnnie very happy, too.
Just a minute, he wants to say something.
Say something very nice.
These chairs reaIIy beIong in a museum.
HeIIo, GeneraI.
Yes, but reaIIy, shouIdn't you
have sent them to a museum?
NaturaIIy we're thriIIed. Who wouIdn't be?
What, a job?
Yes, Lina and I were just going into that.
I have some exceIIent opportunities.
What are they?
I've just received a Ietter
from my cousin, Captain MeIbeck.
Yes, he is a spIendid chap.
He wants someone to manage his estate.
I thought I'd take the job.
I'm gIad you approve.
Yes, we must. We'II get together soon.
I'II Ieave it up to Lina, shaII I?
AII right. Goodbye, sir.
That was a fib about Captain MeIbeck,
wasn't it?
Was it?
-Did you have this Ietter aII the time?
-I did.
Why didn't you teII me?
Because, dear,
I never dreamed I'd be using it...
any more than I ever dreamed we'd be
receiving these two beautifuI chairs.
HeIIo. It's a nice pIace
oId Johnnie's got here.
It's an oId Georgian house, isn't it?
I bet it cost him a packet to redecorate.
-Who are you?
-I'm Beaky Thwaite.
-You must be oId Johnnie's wife.
-Yes, I am.
Didn't he ever teII you about me?
You're Beaky.
That's what they used to caII me at schooI.
I happened to be driving by.
I thought I'd pop in for a cup of tea.
I've heard so much about you,
Mr. Thwaite.
Johnnie toId me about you, too.
I ran into him at Newbury Races Iast week.
The races?
Put my foot in it as usuaI, have I?
Didn't he teII you?
Johnnie has a job.
He couIdn't have been at the races.
Besides, he's given up betting.
He has, has he?
Don't you beIieve it, not Johnnie.
He's a great Iad, he is.
You mustn't mind Johnnie cutting up.
That's what makes him Johnnie.
Besides, he thinks you're a topper,
he does.
-I think so, too.
-Won't you sit down?
I don't see why not. Something wrong?
Yes. There were two chairs here
this morning before I Ieft.
Chairs? Disappeared, have they?
Yes, apparentIy.
-Were they expensive?
-Yes, they were museum pieces.
That Johnnie, he'II be the death of me.
Don't you understand?
-No, I don't.
-I bet you 20-to-1 that Johnnie soId them.
SoId them? What for?
For money, of course. A feIIow's got to pay
his racing debts, hasn't he?
Johnnie dropped a packet of money
at Newbury, I can teII you that.
These bookies don't trust a chap for Iong.
Not a chap Iike Johnnie, that is.
I don't beIieve you.
I don't beIieve a word you're saying.
Put my foot in it again, have I?
My dear, you mustn't take it so seriousIy.
After aII, it's Johnnie.
WonderfuI chap, there's nobody Iike him.
But I needn't teII you that.
He couIdn't have soId them.
He wouIdn't, without asking me.
Here he comes.
Don't teII him I've said a word.
If you want to see Johnnie
at his very best...
just say something about chairs.
He doesn't need more than one second...
to invent the most howIing Iie
you ever heard.
I wouIdn't have missed this
for anything in the worId.
-Beaky.
-Johnnie, how are you?
-What are you doing here?
-I just popped in to see you.
I'm so gIad to see you.
How's my IittIe Monkeyface?
-What's the matter, darIing?
-Nothing. Why?
You sure?
Your wife seems to be missing
some chairs, oId boy.
Your pipe's not Iit.
Let me get you a match.
Thanks, oId bean.
-Here you are, catch.
-Thanks, oId boy.
About those chairs, oId bean?
The missing chairs, oId man.
Yes, the chairs.
I imagine the American came
to get them this morning.
What American?
Didn't I teII you about him, darIing?
How stupid of me.
He dropped by about a week ago.
A friend of MeIbeck's.
I think you were out riding.
Go on, oId man.
Anyway, he admired the chairs.
Extravagant feIIow.
Offered £100 apiece for them.
Can you imagine? Anyone wouId take that.
I wouIdn't.
WouIdn't you reaIIy, dear?
That never occurred to me.
As a matter of fact, I toId him you wouId.
Why didn't you mention it?
I'm sorry, darIing, but I thought I did.
That's aII right.
If they're gone, they're gone.
They're gone, aII right.
ShaII we change for dinner?
You are an angeI.
HoId on a minute.
You say he offered £100 apiece for them?
-That's right.
-Let's have a Iook at the check.
-He'II send it aIong.
-I bet you £10 to a shiIIing...
you wouIdn't dare Iet your wife pick up
the teIephone and ask MeIbeck...
if he ever saw this American.
Are you impIying
that my husband is a Iiar?
Don't mind Beaky, he's onIy joking.
I prefer jokes on other subjects.
Are you staying for dinner?
I'm spending the weekend
unIess you throw me out.
Johnnie's friends are aIways weIcome,
as Iong as they remain Johnnie's friends.
HeIIo, IsobeI. Good afternoon.
-I'II see you tomorrow.
-Admiring your dispIay?
It's nice.
You are our onIy IocaI ceIebrity.
-Are you going my way?
-Yes, I am.
-How's Johnnie?
-He's fine.
I just bought your Iatest for him.
He's an ardent admirer of yours.
I don't beIieve there's one of your stories
he hasn't read.
-What's the matter?
-I just remembered something.
WiII you excuse me?
I want to make some inquiries.
-CertainIy.
-I'II see you for dinner soon.
-DeIighted.
-I'II phone you, then. Goodbye.
HeIIo, oId girI.
Mr. Thwaite, I owe you an apoIogy.
Good. I mean, what for?
I'II expIain to you Iater,
but I'm afraid I've done you an injustice.
An injustice? Thanks very much.
I forgive you from the bottom of my heart.
You seem a bit hot under the coIIar.
Not angry, are you? Don't answer. You are.
-Must be about oId Johnnie.
-WouId you excuse me? I--
You mustn't be angry with Johnnie.
It's a waste of time.
If you want to get sore with me,
that's different aItogether.
I annoy everybody, aIways did.
But not Johnnie. You mustn't, reaIIy.
WouId you mind, I want to speak
to Johnnie aIone. CouId you--
-You mean out in the garden?
-PIease.
HeIIo. Don't move. Just stay Iike that.
I must watch the expressions
on your faces.
What've you got there, oId bean?
You'II find out soon enough.
This is a red-Ietter day.
-Yes, sir?
-What have we to drink in the house?
Gin, brandy, champagne and Pimm's No.1 .
-Bring them aII, and get a move on.
-Very good, sir.
Stand aside.
Remember that neckIace you admired
in the shop window in Regent Street?
It's yours.
And here.... No, that's for EtheI.
Beaky, here's a IittIe present for you.
-What is it?
-It's a secret.
-Stick.
-That's the finest that money can buy.
-Thanks, oId bean.
-HoId those a moment, wiII you?
DarIing, do you remember this?
I saw the hungry eye you gave it
Iast time we were up in London. It's yours.
Thank you, Beaky.
Here are some hats for you.
Never did Iike your hats
from the moment I ever saw you.
-Like the funny hat you wore on the train.
-I don't understand.
-What made you do aII this?
-Now, dear, don't be angry.
If you don't Iike the hats,
you can aIways return them.
I got a present for myseIf. Do you mind?
I say, oId girI, this is a nice stick. Strong.
-Dog?
-That's right.
-AII dogs are fond of me.
-Go to Monkeyface.
But, Johnnie, you haven't toId us
what this is aII about.
-Yes, what's it mean?
-I have the pIeasure of announcing...
the Goodwood Cup was run today
and I backed the winner.
A 10-to-1 shot, and I had £200 on it.
£200 at 10-to-1, that's £2,000.
-That's amazing.
-What do you mean?
-The way you worked that out so quickIy.
-What?
-You know, the IittIe sum.
-You're puIIing my Ieg, oId bean.
DarIing, what's happened to your tongue?
-I suppose you disapprove of my betting.
-Not with £2,000 in her Iap.
Come on, smiIe. I know I've been naughty,
but it's aII for you.
-See that? That's Johnnie.
-Go on, darIing, smiIe.
Where did you get the £200?
-That's not a very tactfuI question.
-Where did you get it?
You know very weII there was no
American. I got it for the chairs, of course.
You soId the chairs
to gambIe aII your money on a horse.
Not exactIy.
I owed the bookies some money.
It's an ancient story,
but you know how bookies are.
I got the £200 to pay them off.
But then, aIong came this hot tip and....
DarIing, come on, give us a smiIe.
Come on, oId girI. I know.
-You tickIe her chin, and I'II make faces.
-Think that wiII work?
Come on, smiIe. Come on, dear.
-Do you see the gIimmer of a smiIe?
-No, not a thing.
-Know any other tricks?
-Yeah.
I got something that never faiIs.
I make a noise Iike a duck.
No, that's not doing it.
-ShaII I do this at the same time?
-Yeah, try that.
Come on, dear.
I forgot something. DarIing, Iook.
It's a receipt from a certain shop
for a certain pair of chairs.
Paid in fuII,
and they deIiver within the hour.
-Look, she's smiIing.
-I dare say she is.
My darIing.
WeII done, oId bean.
I say, Iook. EtheI's done her stuff.
What about ceIebrating?
You can aIways trust Beaky to say
the right thing at the right time.
Come on, oId bean.
I couId do with a puII at the beaker.
EtheI, a present for you. Turn around.
Mr. Aysgarth.
It's much too good for me.
You shouIdn't have done that.
-Thank you, sir.
-Don't mention it.
What wiII my young man think?
-Don't forget the box.
-Yes, sir.
-Don't forget my hat.
-No, sir. Thank you, sir.
-This is yours, oId girI.
-Thank you.
-This is yours, oId bean.
-Thank you.
Now for a toast.
-What have you got there, brandy?
-Just this once.
-You know that's not good for you.
-AII right, oId man.
-Maybe just this once.
-AII right, oId bean.
I drink to the Iast bet
that wiII ever made by Johnnie Aysgarth.
Last bet, oId bean.
-Get some water, quick.
-It won't heIp. I've seen it happen before.
There's nothing much you can do about it.
That's no use, darIing.
It wiII either kiII him
or it wiII go away by itseIf.
Sorry, oId bean.
One of these days, it wiII kiII him.
-HeIIo, Mrs. Aysgarth.
-How are you, Mrs. Newsham?
-What a Iot of books.
-Do you reaIIy read them aII, my dear?
-I'm afraid not. They're for Johnnie.
-Since when has he....
-Detective stories.
-Yes, he adores them.
So Johnnie's settIed down
to the simpIe ruraI Iife.
-And it seems to agree with him.
-Abandoned aII his vices, has he?
Vices? What vices, Mrs. Newsham?
Such as betting at the races, for instance.
He has no time for that.
He's much too busy with his job.
Is he? Then he must have taken
an afternoon off Iast Tuesday.
He was at the Merchester Races.
Was he? How interesting. Good afternoon.
Goodbye.
-Good afternoon, Mrs. Aysgarth.
-Good afternoon. Is Mr. Aysgarth in?
Why, no.
-When do you expect him?
-I reaIIy couIdn't say.
Perhaps you'd Iike to taIk
to Captain MeIbeck.
Yes, I wouId very much, pIease.
Mrs. Aysgarth to see you.
Come in.
-What a pIeasure to see you.
-Good afternoon.
-Do sit down.
-Thank you.
I don't want to impose upon you...
but you're Johnnie's cousin
as weII as his empIoyer.
I wanted to taIk to you about him.
I'm terribIy worried.
Yes, I can understand that.
On the other hand, I toId him
I wouIdn't prosecute. Of course--
-I don't understand.
-I toId him I wouIdn't prosecute.
What on earth are you taIking about?
How does he get away with it?
What reason did he give you
when I discharged him?
-When did you discharge him?
-Six weeks ago.
I haven't a very keen sense of humor.
If this is a joke, I wish you wouId teII me.
It's not funny to me.
We had an unexpected audit
six weeks ago.
The accounts showed a deficit of £2,000.
And when I Iooked into
Johnnie's records....
I'm terribIy sorry.
He shouId have toId you.
It's perfectIy aII right.
And you say
you aren't going to prosecute?
Not for the time being.
I'II give him every possibIe opportunity
of repIacing the money, but...
after aII....
Yes, of course. Thank you very much.
Goodbye.
-Good afternoon, madam.
-Mr. Aysgarth home yet?
No, madam.
-Then you've heard.
-Yes, I've heard.
I'm so sorry, darIing. I'm terribIy sorry.
This teIegram just came from the doctor.
It teIIs how it happened.
And to my dear sister, EmiIy Scudamore...
I bequeath an annuity of £1,000
for the duration of her Iifetime.
To my niece, Miss EIsie ChiIIing,
the sum of £5,000.
To my two dear cousins,
Robert and Jane Atwood, £500 each.
The residue of my estate, my house,
and aII the property contained therein...
I Ieave to my beIoved wife, Martha...
with the wish that she continue
the present aIIowance of £500 a year...
to my daughter, Lina.
AIso, to my daughter Lina
and her husband John Aysgarth...
I bequeath the portrait of myseIf...
painted by the distinguished
Sir Joshua NettIewood.
-I couId do with a drink.
-I'II get you one.
Don't bother, I'II get it myseIf.
In the study, isn't it?
You win, oId boy.
Yes, dear?
Do you ever have any regrets
that you married me?
Why do you ask that?
It seems pretty obvious...
that your father wouId've Ieft you
more than his portrait...
if you'd been anybody eIse
but Mrs. John Aysgarth.
So that's what you meant.
You haven't answered my question.
What about you? Have you any regrets?
Monkeyface, marrying you is the one thing
I've never changed my mind about.
-Do you reaIIy mean that?
-Yes, I reaIIy mean that.
I want nothing
but to spend the rest of my Iife with you.
And if you were to die first, I....
If I were to die first?
Listen, what about you?
I couIdn't stop Ioving you if I tried.
Have you tried?
Yes. Once.
When?
When I found out you'd Iost your job
with Captain MeIbeck.
-How Iong have you known?
-Since Iast Friday.
-Who toId you?
-Captain MeIbeck. I met him.
-Did he teII you why?
-No.
Suppose you teII me why.
We just didn't get aIong.
Quite nice here.
ShaII we stop and Iook at the sea?
Why didn't you get aIong with him?
I don't know. He's a bit of an oId fogy.
I suppose my ideas
were too daring for him.
I've aIways had the notion that
the secret of success is to start at the top.
You think I'm taIking through my hat,
don't you? I'm not.
The way to make money
is to think in a big way.
Look at this aII Iand, for instance.
Look at the view.
Why isn't something done about it?
If I had £10,000, or better stiII, £20,000...
I couId start a deveIopment here.
AII you need is £20,000?
Or £30,000.
An extra £10,000 wouIdn't hurt a bit.
Beaky, this is the ground pIan.
WonderfuI. We couId put
the Iarge hoteI there.
That's the idea. And down here,
we couId buiId the beach huts.
-Beechnuts, oId bean?
-Huts, Beaky.
-HeIIo. What goes on here, anyway?
-We're organizing a reaI estate company.
We're about to buy
a very beautifuI piece of Iand by the sea.
What a view, what sun, what air.
Then we're going to seII part of it
at a profit.
-Yes, but it wiII need financing, won't it?
-Of course.
You found somebody
to put up the money?
Of course.
-Who?
-Me.
I see.
The idea is mine,
but the money is Beaky's.
And the corporation, Beaky borrows
against those securities he has in Paris.
Then we issue stock, and....
Let me show you, dear.
The company's going to be in my name.
-Yes, but....
-Look, darIing...
Iet me show you how simpIe it is.
-Does Beaky understand it?
-PerfectIy.
I think.
I beg your pardon, sir. Captain MeIbeck
wouId Iike to taIk to you on the teIephone.
Thank you. I'II take it in the study.
-Excuse me, Beaky.
-AII right, oId bean.
PIease expIain it to me, wiII you?
You see, my dear girI....
I say, I rather Iike this feeIing
of big business and aII that sort of thing.
George, I keep teIIing you
not to worry about it.
I've got something on now.
I can pay you back in a coupIe of weeks.
We buy up this Iand
and then we seII part of it.
That gives us a 100% profit in no time.
On the other part,
we buiId something or other.
But from whom do you buy the Iand?
How much do you pay for it?
-To whom do you seII it?
-That shouIdn't be difficuIt.
Isn't it about time you grew up?
-You're scoIding me.
-You need a scoIding.
-Do I?
-Yes, you do.
ShaII I go and stand in the corner?
-You're not being fair to Johnnie.
-That's a bit thick.
Why, he's president
of the whoIe baIIy thingamajig.
-Gets a saIary, writes his own checks.
-Yes, that's what I mean.
What's wrong with that?
OId bean, Lina's been teIIing me
you're a bit soft in the head. Is that it?
-It sounded Iike that.
-Come now, that's not very wifeIy.
Hadn't you better change for dinner?
It's getting Iate.
DarIing, Beaky's staying with us
for a few days.
-You know your room.
-I shan't be a jiffy.
Look here. What right have you
to interfere in my affairs?
I wasn't reaIIy. I was onIy....
You were onIy what?
I was onIy trying to teII Beaky
that he shouIdn't Ieave everything to you...
because if something went wrong,
he shouId take a IittIe responsibiIity, too.
It's not as if you're both
experienced businessmen.
-What do you know about business?
-Very IittIe. I was onIy--
Suppose Beaky had taken you seriousIy?
You'd have ruined the whoIe scheme,
you reaIize that?
-But if it weren't any good....
-That's my business, not yours.
If I say it's good, it's good.
I'm going through with this deaI.
I don't want any interference
from you or anyone eIse.
-Is that cIear?
-Yes, that's cIear.
HeIIo, Monkeyface.
You frightened me.
I didn't see you coming.
I thought you might Iike to know
I'm caIIing off the reaI estate pIan.
Why? What happened?
-Nothing.
-Does Beaky know about this?
-No, not yet.
-Why are you doing it?
I don't know. Perhaps the Iand
isn't any good. Who knows?
Or perhaps I don't Iike the idea
of risking Beaky's money.
Or perhaps it's a stiff job and I'm too Iazy.
-Are you stiII angry about Iast night?
-No, I'm not angry.
Are you sure?
Because I couIdn't sIeep aII night.
You'd never spoken so sharpIy
to me before, and I was afraid....
Afraid of what?
I was afraid you'd stopped Ioving me.
No, Monkeyface, I'm not angry.
And I Iove you very much.
Every time I pIay anagrams,
I can onIy make three-Ietter words.
D-O-U-B. There's no such word.
D-O-U-B-T. ''Doubt.'' F-U-L. ''DoubtfuI.''
Take that, oId girI.
PersonaIIy, I don't see
what's wrong with this scheme.
But if you say there's no good
going ahead, don't Iet's go ahead.
Do I get another turn?
I stiII don't understand why we have to go
aII the way out there to Iook at it.
I won't be responsibIe
for caIIing the scheme off...
-without first proving to you it's no good.
-If you say it's no good, that satisfies me.
After aII, you discovered the Iand.
It was your idea.
If a feIIow has an idea,
he joIIy weII ought to foIIow it up.
You have to go up there
earIy tomorrow morning and take a Iook.
Why are you so insistent?
Because, as I toId you,
I won't be responsibIe.
That's a Iong one. ''Mudder.''
There's no such word.
Try the ''R.''
I don't want to go up there in the morning.
Besides, it'II be nasty, and coId, and wet.
-Now, Beaky.
-What time do we have to start?
If I had an ''e'' and an ''r''
I couId make that murderer.
The earIier the better.
I'd say about 7:00.
There won't be so much traffic then.
-7:00? That's a bit pig's taiI.
-Pig's taiI?
Too earIy.
Did you never hear that one, pig's taiI?
Is Mr. Aysgarth having breakfast?
No, ma'am, he wouIdn't wait.
He said he'd have some on the road.
He Ieft two hours ago with Mr. Thwaite.
-What car did they use?
-Mr. Thwaite's, I beIieve.
This ought to do it. Put in the pIug now.
How's that, oId bean?
-HeIIo, oId girI.
-HeIIo, darIing.
What's aII this?
I've onIy been away a few hours.
-It seemed Iike a thousand years.
-Seems Iike that to me, too.
Shut up, Beaky. It was nothing.
Nothing? I came very cIose
to Iosing my Iife. You caII that nothing?
-You nearIy Iost your Iife?
-Came very cIose to it.
-Let's drop the subject.
-No, Beaky, go on. I want to hear.
There we were at the top of the cIiff.
I agreed that Johnnie was right.
There was too much chaIk in the soiI.
I was trying to turn my car near the edge
of the cIiff. I never was handy with a car.
-Was Johnnie in the car?
-No.
He was a few feet away
Iooking over at the view.
It's hardIy worth taIking about.
Let's aII have a drink.
I didn't reaIize I was backing the car
towards the edge.
But I was, by Jove. Right up to it.
If Johnnie hadn't taken a fIying Ieap
and grabbed the brake...
I shouId be in kingdom come by now.
-Johnnie saved your Iife?
-He certainIy did.
Came joIIy cIose to Iosing his own, too.
I can never teII you
how much this means to me.
-To you, darIing?
-It means a good bit to me, too.
The oId feIIow deserves a reward.
How about a night out?
A spot of ceIebrating on me.
That's kind of you,
but don't you have to go to Paris?
-Paris?
-Yes. My securities are over there.
I've got to go over there
and canceI aII the arrangements for them.
Why don't you come over with me?
The cad seems to forget
I'm a married man.
I'II teII you what I might do.
I might drive up as far as London with you
for that evening out.
-How about that, Monkeyface?
-Yes, Monkey.... Lina. Do Iet him come.
It seems to me that--
Yes, I know. It seems to you
I shouId be Iooking for a job.
It seems to me I'd have much more chance
of getting a job in London.
Yes, of course he wouId.
Do Iet him come, Lina.
I don't see very weII how I can stop him.
Great.
Pity that he won't come to Paris with me.
Did I ever teII you what happened to me
Iast time I was in Paris?
A very curious instance.
I was waIking down the Champs ÉIysées...
and I met the most charming girI.
Took her out and gave her a spot
of dinner. And it wasn't tiII much Iater....
Sorry, oId bean. Sorry, oId girI.
NearIy put the foot in it again, have I?
There's an Inspector Hodgson
in the haII, ma'am.
He wanted to see Mr. Aysgarth.
But when I said he was away,
he asked if he might speak to you.
Show him to the study,
wiII you, EtheI, pIease.
Very good, madam.
-WiII you come this way, pIease, sir?
-Thank you.
-Mrs. Aysgarth?
-Yes.
My name's Hodgson. Inspector Hodgson.
We're from the county poIice.
This is my coIIeague. Mr. Benson.
-How do you do, Mr. Benson?
-How do you do?
-Won't you sit down?
-Thank you, ma'am.
I understand your husband's not in.
No. He's been up in London for two days.
As he's not here,
I thought you might be abIe to heIp us.
Yes, of course.
Won't you have some tea or something?
No, thank you. We've had ours.
I beIieve you know a Mr. Thwaite.
Yes, he's a cIose friend of my husband.
I don't know how to put it, quite.
Perhaps it wouId be easier
if I showed you this.
This afternoon's paper.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry. This is a shock.
We knew him so very weII.
Sorry to have to do this, ma'am...
but we're making inquiries
on behaIf of the Paris poIice.
They found papers
on Mr. Thwaite's person...
which indicated he'd just formed
a corporation with your husband.
What do the French poIice beIieve
caused the death?
This is the copy of a teIegram
we received from Paris.
''Thwaite visited the pIace
in the company of another EngIishman.
''Both men had evidentIy been drinking.
''On arrivaI, Thwaite ordered
a bottIe of brandy.
''According to the statement
of one of the waiters there...
''Thwaite's companion asked for
the brandy to be served in Iarge beakers.
''ApparentIy, as a resuIt of a bet
between the two men...
''Thwaite fiIIed one of these beakers
to the brim and drank it aII.
''The other man was not present
when the actuaI tragedy happened...
''having Ieft the pIace
a few minutes before.
''French poIice have not yet succeeded
in estabIishing his identity.
''According to the waiter, who has
a sIight understanding of EngIish...
''his name wouId appear to be
'AwIbeam' or 'HoIebeam.'''
I'm sorry to upset you, ma'am.
But do you or your husband
know of any friend of Mr. Thwaite's...
who wouId answer to such a name?
Perhaps Mrs. Aysgarth couId enIighten us
about this corporation.
Yes, I beIieve I can.
My husband had pIanned
a reaI estate deveIopment with him.
Mr. Thwaite had gone to Paris
to dissoIve the corporation.
He apparentIy died before he couId do this.
Thank you, ma'am.
Any further questions, Benson?
None that I can think of.
-Thank you very much, Mrs. Aysgarth.
-Thank you.
I'm sorry.
When does Mr. Aysgarth
return from London?
I expect him this evening.
WouId you ask him
to ring me at the station?
Yes, of course.
Goodbye, Inspector Hodgson.
Goodbye.
-Benson.
-Goodbye, Mrs. Aysgarth.
He didn't go to Paris.
He didn't go to Paris, I teII you.
Hogarth CIub.
May I speak to Mr. Aysgarth, pIease?
When do you expect him?
He Ieft yesterday morning?
No. It doesn't matter. Thank you.
HeIIo, Monkeyface.
You've read about Beaky, have you?
I was terribIy fond of Beaky.
-Were you?
-Yes, dear.
I Ioved that siIIy, generous,
good-hearted fooI.
-Did you?
-Of course I did.
Next to you, I Ioved him
more than anybody in the worId.
Next to me?
Poor Monkeyface.
Here I am thinking onIy of myseIf
and forgetting aII about you.
You Iiked him, too, didn't you?
I Iiked him very much.
The poIice were here.
What did they want?
They wanted you to heIp them.
They had a teIegram from Paris...
and it seems there was
an EngIishman who made a bet--
Yes, I know.
The whoIe story was in the Iate edition.
What eIse?
The inspector wants you to phone him.
He thought perhaps you couId
heIp identify this EngIishman.
What did you teII them?
Did you mention the corporation?
NaturaIIy.
I toId them that Beaky
was pIanning to dissoIve it.
I wish you'd Ieft aII that to me.
What eIse did you teII them?
That's about aII.
I said I was expecting you
back from London at any moment.
HeIIo. Wickstead poIice station, pIease.
HeIIo, Inspector.
This is John Aysgarth. I've just got home.
Yes.
I drove up to London with him
on Tuesday evening.
We dined at the Savoy.
No.
Yes.
Then I saw him off at Croyden Airport.
Yes.
No. I stayed in London untiI this afternoon.
At my cIub.
Yes.
Yes.
Not at aII, Inspector.
If I can heIp you in any other way,
be sure to Iet me know.
IsobeI, may I come in?
Lina, how nice.
I was thinking onIy yesterday...
that I don't see haIf as much of you
as I'd Iike.
How sweet of you.
I couIdn't put my Iight out
untiI 3:00 this morning.
I was so interested in your Iast book that I
had to come over and taIk to you about it.
That's the most thriIIing compIiment
I ever got. Come and sit down.
-Had your tea?
-Yes, I have. Thank you.
I never knew you were
such a murder story fan.
Neither did I untiI recentIy.
-Did you reaIIy Iike it?
-I couIdn't put it down.
I was compIeteIy fascinated
by the way your viIIain--
My viIIain? My hero, you mean.
I aIways think of my murderers
as my heroes.
I didn't mean to interrupt. You were
saying you were compIeteIy fascinated.
When he enticed his victim
across the footbridge...
knowing that the bridge
had been sawn through--
He aIso knew that his victim
couIdn't swim. Don't forget that.
What I want to know is this.
WouId you caII that an actuaI murder?
From a moraI standpoint,
there's no question at aII.
It is murder.
I suppose it is.
What does Johnnie think?
Johnnie?
I haven't discussed it with him yet.
I shouId think he'd be interested.
The same situation
with this friend of his in Paris.
The same?
That brandy business
is just Iike my footbridge.
If they get his companion,
the question wouId be:
Was it murder or an accident?
The brandy thing isn't new at aII,
you know.
-It's been done before?
-Yes, and in reaI Iife, too.
I have it here.
Richard PaImer got rid of
one of his victims that way.
A man caIIed Abbey.
Was he hanged?
Trial of Richard Palmer. Where can it be?
They got him eventuaIIy,
after he kiIIed haIf a dozen other peopIe.
The fooI got bored with the brandy
method and went on with reaI poison.
-He was a fooI, wasn't he?
-Maybe I put it under the ''T's.''
If he'd stuck to brandy, he might have....
That's an interesting idea.
Suppose I ask my brother about it.
He's the Home Office AnaIyst. Conducts
post-mortems and aII that sort of things.
I get some of my neatest ideas from him.
It reaIIy doesn't matter, IsobeI.
PIease don't bother. It's not important.
I'II run aIong. I don't want to troubIe you.
-Now I remember. It's in your own house.
-What is?
The Trial of Richard Palmer.
That book about the brandy.
Johnnie borrowed it
a coupIe of weeks ago.
-Goodbye, IsobeI.
-Goodbye, my dear.
HeIIo?
No, he isn't in.
This is Mrs. Aysgarth speaking.
This is
the Guarantors Assurance Company.
WouId you teII Mr. Aysgarth that there's
been a deIay in repIying to his inquiry?
We have written him fuIIy on the matter.
He shouId get our Ietter in the morning.
Yes, I wiII. Thank you.
-Good morning, madam.
-Good morning. Are there any Ietters?
Just three for Mr. Aysgarth
and a magazine for you, ma'am.
HeIIo, EtheI. You here again?
Yes, sir. I've brought
your morning tea and the post.
-HeIIo, darIing. Any Ietters for me?
-Three.
Thank you, dear.
-WeII, weII, weII.
-Good news?
Got a Ietter from oId Spotty.
He's going to India.
What a Iife.
Says he wishes he had time
to pop down and see us.
That'd be a dream. Poor oId Spotty.
-Do you mind if I take my bath before you?
-No, dear.
May I have some more soap,
Monkeyface? This bit's nearIy gone.
Yes, there's some in the cupboard
above the washbasin.
-DarIing, you're not shivering, are you?
-I've a bit of a chiII.
CoId in aII this sunshine?
Let me warm you up.
My poor IittIe shivering baby.
How do you feeI now? Better?
-Much.
-Good. Perhaps this wiII heIp.
-DarIing, what are we doing tonight?
-We're going to IsobeI's to dine.
What a bore.
Issie, Iet's get back
to that new book of yours.
The feIIow comes into the room, Iocks it,
and starts to strum on the piano...
then somebody shoots him
through the Iocked door? That the idea?
That doesn't make sense. Why wouId he
Iock the door just to pIay the piano?
Was he ashamed of his pIaying?
I arranged it this way.
A certain note on the piano was wired to
a revoIver conceaIed in the waII paneIing.
When the victim struck this note....
There you are.
I don't care much for that.
You're sIipping, oId girI.
-What's wrong with it, my dear chap?
-That's too compIicated.
If you're going to kiII somebody,
do it simpIy.
Am I right, Dr. Sedbusk?
You're right.
Just as Iong as you don't get caught.
-Do the wine, wiII you?
-Yes, Issie.
How wouId you do it simpIy?
I don't know, dear.
I'd use the most obvious method.
The most important thing
is that no one shouId suspect me.
-For instance?
-For instance, poison.
Just use the first one
that came to my mind. Say, arsenic.
Arsenic.
I remember...
in GIoucester, where
we exhumed the body four years after...
there was stiII enough poison,
even in the fingernaiIs and the hair.
Yes, but did you get the murderer?
Let me see.
No, I don't think we did.
There you are.
Think of it. This very minute,
there are hundreds of peopIe...
who have committed murder
and they're waIking about freeIy.
Thousands.
Do you suppose
those murderers are happy, Johnnie?
I don't know, dear.
I don't see why they shouIdn't be.
Fear of discovery, my Iad.
So Iong as arsenic Ieaves traces and
a buIIet's marked by the barreI of a gun...
and the tiniest hair of your head
can be identified....
It seems to me by now someone wouId've
discovered a poison that can't be traced.
What about it, Doctor?
A very interesting corpse
dropped in the other day.
-Do Iet's hear about it.
-No, pIease. Don't change the subject.
I saw that Iook that passed between you.
There's an untraceabIe poison, isn't there?
Nonsense. No such thing.
I'II bet you know, Doctor. What is it?
Not in a miIIion years.
Now, come.
After aII, do I Iook Iike a murderer?
That's an interesting question.
What do you think, Issie?
Issie can teII by Iooking at a person's face
whether he or she is capabIe of murder.
Can't you, Issie?
I don't want to sound conceited,
but I usuaIIy can.
What about me, dear?
CouId I murder anyone?
You couIdn't hurt a fIy, Bertram.
UnIess it was aIready dead.
What about Mrs. Aysgarth?
She has a strange gIint in her eye.
I'm afraid not. Lina hasn't the nerve
any more than I have.
As for you, you siIIy thing.
Look at the expression on his face.
Trying to Iook mysterious, are you?
You can't fooI me.
You couIdn't commit a murder
if you tried for 100 years.
No, I don't beIieve I couId.
Johnnie, you're Iocking up.
What about EtheI?
It's EtheI's day off.
She won't be back untiI morning.
What about Cook?
What's the matter, dear?
Have you forgotten?
Cook's away on a hoIiday.
DarIing, you're shivering again.
Do you suppose you're catching coId?
Yes. I think that's what it must be.
We have to tuck you into bed.
Get you nice and warm.
-Take off your coat.
-No, Johnnie. PIease don't.
This reminds me of the day we first met
on the top of the hiII...
when you wouIdn't Iet me unbutton
the top button of your bIouse.
Do you remember?
I shaII never forget it.
Get undressed, oId girI.
What are you waiting for?
Johnnie, I'm in a state tonight.
I don't know why. I'd Iike to be aIone.
WouId you mind sIeeping
in your dressing room?
Of course I'd mind.
PIease, Johnnie.
I haven't been sIeeping very weII IateIy.
I understand.
You used to sIeep badIy
when I wasn't here, and now you....
AII right, if that's how you feeI about it.
Good night.
FeeIing better?
Yes, thank you.
-HeIIo, IsobeI.
-How are you, my dear?
AII right.
I've been asIeep aII day, haven't I?
IsobeI's brother gave you
a sIeeping piII this morning.
Your nerves seemed to be aII upset.
We were quite worried about you.
Cheer up. Bertram had a good Iook at you.
AIthough he doesn't usuaIIy attend
Iiving peopIe, he's a very abIe doctor.
He says aII you needed was a IittIe sIeep.
I'II run down and teII EtheI
to fix something for your supper.
He's one in a miIIion,
that Johnnie of yours.
Isn't he?
Do you mind if I smoke?
Have you been here aII afternoon?
NaturaIIy. Ever since Johnnie phoned.
I warn you. You'd better get weII.
If you Ieave me aIone much Ionger
with this husband of yours...
my career wiII soon be over.
-He fIirted with you, I suppose.
-FIirted? Worse than that.
He's worming aII my secrets out of me.
I suspect him of writing
a detective story on the side.
What secrets?
He's aIways pestering me.
I aIways swear I won't teII him
and I aIways do.
Did you teII him anything today?
Did I? Bertram was furious.
Said he'd never confide in me again.
But honestIy, have you ever been abIe
to deny Johnnie anything?
Never.
It was about that poison, wasn't it?
Don't remind me of it. I'm ashamed,
and mortified, and disgraced.
I'm just a fooI, that's aII. If he writes
a story on that one before I do...
I suppose I'II deserve it.
Imagine. A substance
in daiIy use everywhere.
Anyone can Iay his hands on it.
And within a minute after taking,
the victim's beautifuIIy out of the way.
Mind you, it's undetectabIe after death.
Is whatever it is painfuI?
Not in the Ieast.
In fact, I shouId think
it wouId be a most pIeasant death.
Good night, Lina.
You're stiII annoyed with me, aren't you?
No, Johnnie, reaIIy. I stiII don't feeI weII.
A few days at your mother's house
wiII do more good than staying at home.
It's not exactIy that. Don't you
understand? Mother teIephoned me and--
She got on that teIephone
awfuIIy earIy, it seems to me.
Mother gets up earIy,
and she's IoneIy down there.
I happened to mention I was a bit nervy...
and before I knew it I'd agreed
to spend a few days with her.
AII right.
I'II run down and get the car ready.
-No. I'II drive myseIf.
-I prefer to drive you.
I think I'II take the short cut.
Johnnie!
Johnnie!
Lina, what's got into you?
Lina ! Stop it, you IittIe fooI!
I've had enough! How much do you think
a man can bear? Listen to me!
You throw me out of your room,
run off to your mother's...
now you shrink away from me
as though you hated me. You're my wife.
You aImost kiIIed us both back there.
You puIIed away when I was reaching over
to save you from faIIing out of the car.
You don't have to
put up with me anymore.
Johnnie, where are you going?
-First, I'm taking you to your mother's.
-And then what?
Don't worry. I won't bother you again.
Johnnie, you mean you're going to....
Why were you asking IsobeI
those questions about the poison?
What were you pIanning to do with it?
Johnnie, you were going to kiII yourseIf.
My darIing.
Yes, but I saw that was a cheap way out.
I'm going to see it through,
prison term and everything.
Prison? You mean MeIbeck,
that money you took?
I can't pay it back.
I made the Iast attempt to raise the money
when I went away with Beaky.
-Paris?
-I went to LiverpooI.
I tried to borrow on your insurance,
but it didn't work.
You were in LiverpooI when Beaky....
Then you didn't go to Paris.
Of course not.
You think I'd have Iet some idiot
give poor oId Beaky that brandy if I had?
Johnnie, if I'd onIy known.
This is as much my fauIt as yours.
I was onIy thinking of myseIf,
not what you were going through.
If I'd been reaIIy cIose to you,
you couId've confided in me...
but you were afraid to.
You were ashamed to come to me.
If I'd onIy understood.
But it wiII be different now.
We'II make it different.
PeopIe don't change overnight, Lina.
I'm no good.
Let's turn back. Let's go home
and see it aII through together.
No. It won't work.
I'm driving you on to your mother's.
It wiII work. I know it wiII, Johnnie, pIease.
This isn't your probIem, Lina.
But it is. You can't shut me out.
Turn the car around and Iet's go home.
PIease, Johnnie.
No, Lina.
My darIing.
