What is an husband, girls?
Man who makes living for home...
...who turns his back in the bed and...
...sleeps like a log.
Like a coach, like a brazier...
...he's the dead-stock of home.
Hey girls, time's changed.
Men of old age were like goliath...
...their houses were like a castle...
...they used to perform like a...
...real men in the bed.
Four wives were not enough for them.
More of four they hooked up
on the string.
What happened? Time's changed.
Men got inferior, women got grandiose.
Then four men became inadequate
for one woman.
Husbands of today don't interfere
in anything...
...give and get what's needed,
pass away earlier with no trouble.
The deceased husband of Hürmüz...
...owner of this huge mansion,
Pasha Fettah...
...used to shout as "Hürmüüüz"...
...and when she gets near him...
...used to say "Check if
everything's all right".
Hürmüz after examining his body,
used to say...
..."My Pasha the excellence, your bird
doesn't show up today either".
Sister, what a famous matchmaker
you are...
...you know what real a man is.
How can we identify the right man?
A man is a bird to leave you
at the first occasion.
It must be you who will catch him
and hitch on to home.
- How? - You will cherish him,
my child.
He runs away if you squeeze too much...
...but if you pat his back,
call him "my hero"...
What does he do? Yes?
Then the chicks scratch around,
cocks cheer up.
How could they boast around
saying "be you divorced"?
You the old guys, you be divorced.
We need new ones.
Hey sister, you are so witty...
Girls, why do you sit down
dressed such indecently...
...there is a man in the room.
No problem, there are no bans
for the groom.
That's right. He looks like a fly
that can bite...
I am sure this guy
will not be able to make it.
He will be cruising in the morning.
Have you heard, Hürmüz had a husband
who passed away in the jail.
How could have she get married
again if he hadn't passed away?
Hürmüz!
- Yes Safinaz?
What number husband is this
among your others?
He is the first after
my deceased husband...
Gossip is something you should do
in one's absence...
But it is a tradition to make
a bride cry, go away.
You the bride, come, let's belly-dance.
Come out with me.
You are not supposed to talk like this...
What are you doing? Are you
going to have me punished?
But they thought I was joking.
I gave your money, I saw how you are.
Aren't we sharing the secret?
Is the price of my matchmaking
only a schilling?
Husband none, home like a barn.
Perfect fit!
You were supposed to take me
to this mansion?
If I hadn't introduced you the codger
called "Fettah Pasha"...
...how would have you owned
this mansion?
But what I get is only a widow's
pension of a few cents.
Let the master take over the job,
child.
Look at the husbands I found;
one Pasha, one Captain!
And yours?
Sorry but you fall in love
with basin in the baths...
...and with clarinet in the
wedding ceremony!
Hey come on, what number
husband is this man? Count please.
Let me see, Fettah Pasha one,
but he passed away, so not included.
Barber Hasan, one;
night man Memo, two...
And you host those slovens
in the mansion, right?
When do all those men visit you?
Don't worry, all of them don't show
up at the same time of course.
Each one has a different day.
On Tuesdays, may barber expects me
at his own home.
He thinks I'm a housemaid
in the mansion.
Wednesdays belong to the
night man Memo...
...he comes here and sleeps
like a log till the morning.
Thursday is the day of my
Sergeant Memed Ali living abroad...
Isn't he dead?
He's in the war, but he is alive,
I receive his letters.
Cotton-fluffer Rüstem in Lüleburgaz,
takes Fridays.
Saturdays taken by Rocket Ömer...
...he's in the jail because of
fighting around.
It's good he's in the jail, I can relax.
And the sixth, if god allows,
Captain Hýzýr!
I plan to allocate him the Sundays...
- Oh my god!
My husbands, my husbands, my husbands...
How can you keep all those
secrets on your own?
OK, this room is yours.
- Hey God!
But now we share the secrets.
- Thank god.
Let's go inside and celebrate this.
- Yes!
Maybe we can match make
Günter Pasha for me, the yellow head.
What?
I am not informed about
the village lately.
I got horny too, for your info.
Come.
Girls!
# You place your boat down
to the arms of the sea #
# Oh sea, Black sea,
takes you in his arms, #
# You sail shore by shore, #
# You release the fish net
down to the water, #
# Boat starts sailing backwards #
# Comes the fish right to the fishnet, #
# Flows the water straight to the rocks #
# Welcome you, the generous sea,
welcome. #
# Oh sea, shivers the water of
Black sea. #
# This girl is sometimes calm but
sometimes get wavy. #
# I am drunk with the love of the sea, #
# Sail my Dragon, this girl's staying
here. #
# I'm looking at Hýzýr behind the boat, #
# Hýzýr the Sea Dragon, sea got misty. #
# Oh sea, shivers the water of
Black sea. #
# This girl is sometimes calm but
sometimes get wavy. #
Release my bird, here came the releaser.
Releaser...
Let my heart, my bird fly
away and land someday...
Time of death comes and finds you.
Let yourself taken into hands someday.
Release my bird, here came the releaser.
Could we set a bird free
for the sake of my father?
Let's do. How much?
Somebody's money,
somebody's prayers lady...
Set this poor one free from the jail.
May God bless you.
May God accept.
Freedom, this is your day, move on...
May god forgive...
God bless you.
God bless you too, bye.
Keep working!
Good night!
See the judge!
You blackguard, don't run away...
What's the matter, why did that
crazy bird-man run away?
He catches birds using birdlimes...
...then sets them free on pay,
that's his job.
Our religion doesn't approve
something like that.
He knows what will happen to him.
I applied him a twenty-stick beating.
From now on I will make it fifty-stick.
Sixty.
Seventy.
Eighty.
Ninety.
One hundred.
A Hundred, one hundred.
Look at the cuckold,
he's rigorously staring around...
...who knows which woman
he's going after.
Even if forty sluts come together...
...they cannot give birth to
such a blackguard.
He can't get satisfied.
We can at least get the women
he left behind, if god wills, Amen.
My grand judge,
finally I could find you.
Night guard Memo, what's this hurry?
Rýza Pasha called you.
Just a moment ago,
a lieutenant informed us.
What is the matter?
Rebellion! Rebellion in
Sultanahmet prison.
Pasha calls your nephew Hüsrev
as well, to go to Beyazýt.
Move, Hüsrev is at home.
Codger...
What about your wives?
Tell me even if it's a lie, I like it.
What's going on my boy,
you'll break the door!
Rebellion in the prison!
Really? What's going on?
Rebellion, I am sure many people
are wounded...
The infirmary of firemen bastion
in Beyazýt...
...is filled with wounded people,
they call all the doctors.
Naturally, they expect you as well.
Let's go, how did it come out?
How many people are wounded?
- So many.
Thanks for coming, come again.
Look at this mansion,
everyday there's party...
Does the bird of this Pasha sing?
Isn't he dead?
If he's dead, who has got married then?
His bird is singing...
It's a tradition.
Would I tell you what to do
in bridal chamber?
To me? I know better than
everybody!
Tell me, when will this man
come home and go back?
Did you set everything properly?
Don't worry, I told Captain Hýzýr that
Father Hadji went to the spa...
I won't let him come home any day
other than Sunday.
And that's only once a month and if
he brings a golden coin each time...
Excellent!
Is there anything you need to ask
before you step into the bridal bed?
Yes there is... Was the call
to night prayer given already?
Yes of course. Why?
Sea Dragon is ready! That's my boat!
Early in the morning,
we'll move for sailing.
Where is this lady?
Where is she?
Where is she? Come on!
Come on! I am sick of your
continuously asking for wedding...
...wedding and wedding!
Stop stop, what's this flurry?
She won't be coming here.
You will be going her room.
Then I am moving. Good night.
Hey, stop!
Come on, move! Come on.
Why are you in such hurry,
what are you doing?
I see you are ready but...
Let's see how the bride is...
What do you mean?
It's a secret, I can't tell.
Don't drive me crazy, tell me now.
Look...
That's very simple...
But see, our girl is coy and shy...
...she doesn't surrender easily, I have
to understand what you'll do with her.
She will get calm if I slap her twice.
Is this how you interpret my words?
How can you do this?
What to do then?
You have to offer her jewellery,
as the cost of seeing her face.
So you can lift her veil.
And then?
You have to use sweet words
to convince her.
Then I say baklava!
Use delicate, nice words.
Needle, string, hair...
I will get crazy with you!
It's me to get crazy.
You the festival clown! You think
I am stupid? Stupid?
Is it you who to teach me kindness?
Two slaps in your face...
Listen to me, if you peek in the
key hole...
I will shot you from your brow,
understand? - OK.
Hürmüz?
Inside my cuff... Where have I put it?
Let's take this first.
Let me present you the jewel to
lift the veil...
...then let's start working.
Come on, lie down my lady.
Pray! - Pray?
Yes, pray for the bridal chamber.
- Pray for what?
For bridal chamber. If you don't,
we can't benefit from our marriage.
I have done it once but...
For bridal chamber?
- No, for funeral.
I didn't know how to do it, so I
copied what the others were doing.
But this time you cannot do it
together with several men!
I don't know any prayers!
God knows what you mean.
Come on my hero, do it as you know.
Ten parts. Move.
You can use the pitcher over there
for ablution.
Take this rope unleashed from its
pier-post away from me, I feel very bad.
What do you say?
- He's a speaking axe, instead of a man.
You've already taken this staff, what
else do you need a man for, right?
Yes. - Yes! Are you nuts?
This is almost a robbery.
This man is a real sly.
How will we get along with him?
He carves both of us.
Leave him to me.
- What will you do, tell me?
Come on tell me, what will you do?
Hey, girl! Oh my god.
# Oh cute and tiny,
her honey skin so fragrant, #
# Come on let's smell each other,
I will not let you to fade away. #
Fire!
# Fire, fire, I am burning! #
- Come firemen, fire, help!
# Fire, fire, I'm burning! Come help
me friends, I am inflamed! #
# Fire, fire, I'm burning! Come help
me friends, I am inflamed! #
# Fire, fire, I'm burning! #
# Come help me friends, I'm inflamed #
- Fire! - Where?
- Boats in Galata are burning.
- What did you say, what?
One ship named Zülfikar,
the other one...
Çehre-i Zâr, next one Dâr-ý Hülya,
and the final one is Sea Dragon.
This damned crew, burned my boat.
- My husband, my husband...
I have to go immediately.
My Sea Dragon is burning!
Don't go, my husband, my husband.
How will I survive without you?
Take this and try to manage yourself,
I am leaving.
My husband, what a miserable woman
I am...
Oh friends, will I ever be happy
in this life...
Help me friends, I am inflamed.
Welcome Pasha, would you
like to have fresh tea?
Will be glad.
Immediately.
Our crazy German came.
I guess his bird is a German one.
I heard he could not piss across the
wall, he could do only when crouching.
Don't make fun of him.
He cannot bite I guess
but he licks well. - Really?
Oh secret love! Fate is merciless...
Times are turbulent / Too many
troubles but friends are few
So strong the enemies,
too bad the fate is.
He sounds too miserable, I can cry.
He speaks German but the
accent is familiar, I think. - Yes.
Hasan, tidy me up.
- As you o-order, of co-course.
I am ash-ashamed to say, it's
be-become only three mo-months...
...I got ma-married to my woman.
Bu-but I couldn't se-see
her fa-face yet.
She is o-off once a we-week,
on Tu-tuesdays...
...but im-impossible to see. Hou-hou...
- Husband?
Housemaid in the mansion.
But her bo-boss is a bad wo woman,
mistreating her all the time.
She ordered to stay in her room,
saying "you are my a a a... "
Abbey. Addict. Attach.
At home!
"A-a-adopted child".
Therefore she cannot visit me.
I didn't even see her face.
She cannot object her, poor girl.
I could not understand.
- Me neither!
She has to say, I just got ma...
Mansion...
- No!
Married, could I as as as...
Be polite...
Not to to to to to...
Don't touch.
- Not told, she can't.
She young and is naive.
- She is?
And I will tell you something,
if you have one hour time...
...I will speak to you for five minutes.
A woman... S-s-s-sss.
- You will see.
S- S-sly, if she's sly...
Co co co... - Contact!
Come close to her...
...whether or not sh-sh-she's
got the thing, can understand...
...the val-val-value of a man,
but no ho ho...
Ho ho ho ho ho... - Horror Hasan?
Hope, no hope... Our chicks
don't understand.
See ho-how I co-co-uld
s- S-s-speak?
But again I started to stu-stu-stutter,
da-dam-damned mouth of you!
I was just about to correct...
Releaser... Releaser.
You keep silent, why don't you sing.
Girls, this bird is singing /
Stands upright.
And lies down /
Fat-bottomed Hayriye /
Always on my mind.
You the birdman Cebrail,
you have wings right?
I can sprout wings if you want.
I can even grow a tail...
Don't think so.
Come on, release, may it bring
me luck...
How can you pay so much just for a bird?
With this money I can release
three concubines.
Don't worry, I will
compensate it later.
For you...
Don't go my bird!
Love your father, don't forget him.
I will ask you a question. - Ask.
This bird flew away and
didn't come back.
How could you teach the bird to
come back after the customer disappears?
I don't tell you, it's a
professional secret.
How many husbands do you have, Hürmüz?
Are you nuts?
Have got chin tuberculosis,
cracked clarinet?
How many roosters you have at home?
How can you manage without
breaking the eggs?
I said Hürmüz, the infidel / I didn't
ask you to throw away.
It's enough if you just look at my face.
Thanks Hasan...
Of course sir.
Thanks. Here is a real man.
Hü-hü-Hürmüz? Hürmüz!
Hasan.
My Hü-hü-Hürmüz!
- My Hasan!
Hü-hü-hü...
- My Hasan!
My Hü-hü-Hürmüz! I wa-was just
thin-thinking about yo-you.
I was, too. My dear, my soul.
I like your beautiful mind.
As I could step out from home,
I wanted to see how my Hasan is doing...
Very good, come in my sultan.
I can't come inside a men's barbershop.
Inappropriate! Banned!
OK. Ho-how cou-could you
get rid of that bitch?
I said I am bored. I kept
telling it for 10 days...
...finally today she asked me
to go out and buy some henna.
Oh that bitch!
My Hürmüz, what's the matter with you?
- Nothing.
Yes there is something,
te-te-tell me.
All the girls in the mansion
have bracelets...
...it's only me who doesn't,
so the headmaid teases on me...
...saying only I don't have...
...saying I have a husband
but not a bracelet.
That headmaid...
You don't know my husband,
he is so strong, such a hero, I said.
He wouldn't think of taking a bracelet
even if he finds it on the road.
What do you think Hasan is like...
What do you think he's like, I said.
My Hü-hü-Hürmüz,
how much is a bracelet?
Two golden coins...
- What?
Two golden coins. - Two, right?
But I would not make you upset,
I already have the money for one...
...It's enough if you give me
the other one.
OK, I die for you.
Let me-me go to the
je-je-jeweller, OK?
Tell me once more!
- Let me go to the jeweller, my Hürmüz.
Tell me once more!
My Hürmüz...
- My dear, my soul, bravo!
# I was yours, stove stick to my hand. #
# Don't leave me away my Hürmüz,
let me be your louse, #
# I come by you and accept
your authority, #
# I die hand in hand, I howl on your door #
# Tie me, let me be your dog, #
# Sit down inside,
don't turn on the lights, #
# Don't get out of the mansion,
don't look around, #
# I would be coming if I had a horse,
Hürmüz... #
# Hürmüz let me be your horse,
ride me. Oh! #
Hürmüz, do you know how
Rüstem suffers here...
I will fluff you like cotton,
I am sick for you.
You the devious. One might
think you are a proper man.
But a good husband is something
which doesn't exist!
How can you dare to spend
the sustenance of your family...
...with a slut in Istanbul.
You the bear. Give him a rose,
he wipes his ass.
He got married to a housemaid
in a mansion.
Then?
You know Süloðlu from Þarköy?
- So?
His wife, Rukiye will be giving
a baths party.
She will also invite that bitch,
so I will tear her hair out!
And show her what it is
to sweat in the bath.
Listen, my husband will be
travelling to Istanbul.
Let's go together with him?
Does your husband allow us to do this?
He has to!
Hey, man!
What, you scared me.
I am going to travel to Istanbul.
What for? - Henna party of Süloðlu.
Good. Who will take care of my mother
when you go there?
Why don't you do it for a few days?
That's not possible. I cannot let
you go on your own.
You are a delicate person.
- What did you say?
Have a safe trip.
Tell my regards to Rukiye.
But return back on Friday.
- Lf I don't?
You don't then.
- Damn you!
Hürmüz! What are you doing
in front of this barbershop?
Oh my country! Oh the
compassionate science...
...may you be pleased and happy today!
Look at the night guard Memo, the hero!
Here is my hero!
You the motherland's children,
stop crying.
Woman! I will spit to the
arch of your chin.
I am about to laugh.
- Don't laugh Memo...
May your future come by soon,
if god wills.
May your day come.
Are you waiting here to read me poems?
I brought the razors of Pasha
to the barber.
And he is out for sharpening them.
Is him the Pasha?
- No, not Pasha.
He is the night guard Memo.
He called the woman.
You will soon see that the roosters
will start singing.
How could the Great Pasha be
hanging around with her?
It's difficult to be a government man.
Also difficult is to be my wife.
You have to wait for Wednesday.
- You the shameless!
Ye-yes, Pasha visits the island
only on Wednesdays.
It's difficult to do it this Wednesday
as well, Hürmüz.
I guess all vacations are cancelled.
Three prisoners escaped,
the situation is very bad.
But my coat is getting old.
And Pasha is getting too stingy.
Oh the bastard Pasha...
Shut up, someone can hear us.
I will inform Pasha about
all this stuff.
Come on...
- See you later, bye.
My Hasan.
- My Hürmüz.
The woman brings a bracelet.
She might have stolen it
from the mansion.
And barber changes it.
Shares are taken up, you see?
I am coming on Tuesday.
Like your mind.
I don't let anybody to swear me.
Don't fo-fo-fo-forget, my Hürmüz.
# My god, don't leave
your servants alone. #
# It's only you, who can stand all alone. #
# It's very tough to survive
without friends and spouses. #
# It's only you, who can stand all alone. #
# Wish, that one coming here be my lover. #
# Wish he's holding a pomegranate
in his hand. #
# Wish two of us were in the same shirt,
while its collar is narrow. #
# The grape of the green vineyard, #
# I look at the road,
nobody's coming, nobody's going, #
# Whom shall I say my word? #
Why are you getting sad?
You have everything you want.
I am getting bored Safinaz,
getting bored.
You, why?
- Because of loneliness.
Hey my girl, your bedroom
is full of men...
...wouldn't more of it cause trouble?
It doesn't matter if I cannot
find the sultan of my heart.
You just talk.
How can we find the sultan for you?
You think it is available for us?
I did! The doctor! He is my sultan.
Doctor? Do you think he is fit for this?
She doesn't have underwear,
but looks for a wedding dress.
If doctor is mine, I wouldn't mind
the others.
I'm sorry but you are not
the one to forswear.
Why do you look so given up my sister?
I love him Safinaz, what can I do...
When and how you started loving him?
He is well-educated, completely
opposite to your ignorant army!
You cannot cheat him by acting a role
like the housemaid in Pasha's mansion.
Yet, would he want you?
Come on, Rukiye has a baths party.
Let's go and dance.
Here he is!
- Who?
Him... Come, come!
- I am scared, who?
Oh, handsome man.
- Yes...
He is ringing the bell of clal's door.
Clal will take over my man!
How can you call him as yours?
Clal takes him.
- Possible; beautiful girl...
Door without an owner can be
opened without a key. What to do...
What happened?
- Oh my head, I am dying.
None of the doctors can save me now,
except my Hüsrev.
You painted all the colours,
only the peanut green left, ha?
I beg you, go and bring my doctor to me.
- Impossible.
Please. I am very sick.
Don't act the sick, at least to me.
OK, I am going.
Mummy, mummy... Help me doctor!
Run, I am dying. - Shut up!
Heart rate is high but no fever.
Could this be an occult fever?
Occult? No occult fever
in medicine.
Please check once more.
- Check what?
My pulse.
- Door... One moment.
Come in Safinaz, welcome.
I am very much worried seeing
the doctor gets inside your home...
Let me see... Is something wrong
with my Iclal?
She faints occasionally, my neighbour.
She has a very fragile body.
Some quinine, some rest.
She will recover not later than next
morning. Don't worry.
Dear doctor, I would like to offer
a cup of coffee, you get rest.
Thanks a lot. I would better leave,
maybe next time I would come by.
Kind of you. Come anytime.
I will go and have ginger and
cinnamon boiled...
...it's good for all kinds of
health problems.
Listen Safinaz, doctor comes
across the patient who will recover.
Stop boiling ginger and have the mind
of the doctor linked to my daughter.
You are a good guide.
A very good matchmaker,
many couples are thankful to you.
My girl got sick just to see
this doctor.
Go reach him. It will be
meritorious for you.
If it's her destiny.
If god wills.
Hmm. Pulse fast, no fever.
Same things. Interesting.
What did you say?
- Nothing my lady.
Very interesting,
let me look at your eyes.
My eyes? Why?
Eyes tell everything.
Don't look at me so close,
I am embarrassed.
Please look up to the ceiling.
What happened?
- Open your mouth.
My mouth? But if my Father Hadji gets
aware of what you do now, he kills me.
Then you please, describe me,
what type of a pain you have.
Sure. It starts from here...
Goes down here, gets around here,
goes down here...
...walks around here, then turns
down here, from here to there...
OK. Where is your husband?
Sorry?
- Your husband I say, husband...
My father does not even allow
the matchmakers to see me.
I see. Don't be shy. I consider you
as a patient, not as a woman.
You don't see me as a woman?
Then what do I look like,
if not a woman?
No, I didn't mean this. I mean you...
Give me your hand please.
My god my god, please don't add this
to my sins.
Or you open your back.
- What?
Your back.
- Why?
I will listen to the inside
of your body. - Impossible!
But I cannot examine you like this.
Ask your maid to help you.
OK I did. I will. I mean, will you open?
- Me?
Open your collar.
This is your sin.
This is my sin. Open.
My god, I beg you,
let me come out of this safely.
Fever high, pulse high. Interesting.
Breathe deeply. Normal.
Open your mouth.
Your name?
Hüsrev.
And I am Hürmüz. Nice to meet you.
# I put fish on the plate,
immersed in the butter, #
# I attached a cloth to the pumpkin,
all because of an idiot. #
# Sun sets like a bowl,
beater hits like a bunt, #
# I flake off like salt because of you. #
# Fire needs chimney, book needs teacher, #
# I need a husband, and
I need him tonight. #
# Hive needs bee, rooster needs corn,
I need a wife and I need her now. #
# Fire needs chimney, rooster needs corn. #
# I need a husband, and
I need him tonight. #
People! Ladies and gentlemen!
Soldiers, idles, listen carefully...
Bloody killer Rocket Ömer has escaped
from the prison, goes around here.
Anybody seen him should immediately
inform me.
We are late.
- I want to dance.
- Hürmüz!
- Ömer!
What are you doing here on the street,
at this time of the night?
Crazy man. Policemen has set up an
ambush for you around the house.
I was trying to inform you.
You early melon, landed from
the sky in a basket.
We planned to go out and inform you.
That's very well-timed,
we came across you.
What? Police set up ambush?
- Yes.
And what did you say them
while going out?
Did you say you would go out
and inform me?
Hey come on, you, the rotten egg.
Do you think I am idiot?
Our neighbour has a baths party,
that was our excuse.
Who is there?
God, return back to home, bitch!
I am coming! - Move!
Hürmüz what are you doing here?
You two, like sluts?
Our neighbour has a baths party,
we were on its way.
But how could we know that the killer...
- OK, OK!
It was very hard to save our virginity!
Mummy, who marries you should cry
and attach blackthorn to his buttocks.
We laughed a lot. Come on.
Look, one of the women you see over
there is the mother of your doctor.
Don't be loose, make her be
convinced in you.
Hüsrev's already taken.
I said such an "uh".
I was laughing inside. Could I miss him?
I sent Safinaz afterwards and asked him.
Doctor has very much enjoyed you,
this is what he said.
Oh my god, let us join
as soon as possible...
I will give the bread and
you will give the onion...
...anybody who is a killjoy,
would never be in joy.
Girls, bring the henna here, come on.
Having all those beautiful girls
around, it mustn't be very difficult...
...to find a bride for Hüsrev.
Look at clal. So naive...
But I guess we have already finished
the searching process.
Hüsrev has already fallen in love
with somebody. - Really?
She is the daughter of a
very proper family. - Good!
And she doesn't have a mother.
- Very very good!
I plan to ask for her father's
approval. - OK, we'll find out.
She lives somewhere around here.
Hey sister, I liked you very much.
- Me too. Where were you so far?
Why didn't we see each other before?
I was in Lüleburgaz.
- I see.
I came here together with Nuriye.
If we were living close to each other,
I would always come and see you.
Doesn't matter, take her as well
and come to me to spend the night.
Sorry but Nuriye's husband
will not allow us.
And I have a blackguard husband too,
he would be worried.
Husbands. All of them should be
destroyed.
Totally agree. Wish he would die.
What's the matter girl?
He got married to a second one and
he spends all his money for her.
His fodder is too much for him,
he neighs...
But you will see how I will punish him.
How could he do this to a young lady
like you? Where did he get that bitch?
This is why I came to stanbul.
As soon as I see the slut,
I will tear off her hair.
Come on, don't worry, if you visit me
tomorrow, we will find her together.
She is supposed to come here tonight,
I came here upon this information.
Shut up girl, there are too many
important people around here.
Let's keep decent now,
when you come tomorrow...
...we will find that slut together.
Hey girl, God sent you to me.
I will lie down too. - OK, do...
Safinaz! Where is that lady playing oud?
- Right now my lady, right now.
Hey girl, come and play your oud,
everybody's waiting for you.
Yes. Let's have fun.
Girls! Why do you sit down like fodder
buffalos? Stand up and dance!
Everybody hear me! Listen!
As you know the song we will
sing now is forbidden for men.
Only women can sing it. It's
women's secret, don't betray it.
# Love chain melts, love age comes, love... #
# I say love, love, love,

How many husbands you have my Hürmüz?
- Look at me, this is number?
My god my god my god,
I gave up.
Come on, stand up. Stand up, stand
up, stand up. - Safinaz?
This is our end, we are finished.
- Why?
The mother of the doctor sent his
housemaid a moment ago. - Then?
They will come over to ask
for your marriage.
What?
- I swear!
My mummy, how can it be?
Stop one moment.
- Look at me, we should be very careful.
Hüsrev is the nephew of the judge.
I have never married
by this style before.
This is so pleasing.
- Are you nuts?
Those women saw you last night...
They already know that
you are married...
A lady playing oud and dancing
but at the same time already married...
...can be accepted as a bride?
You should now be in sorrow, I guess.
I put the cat in the ba ba ba bag.
I put his head in the so so so soup.
How is life? You have the Pasha paste?
How will you use it?
- It is applied to the body.
Something to apply externally.
- No.
Hey barber, make it fly-sharp,
polish my cheeks!
Flies should slip and fall down.
Don't worry sir. I gue-gue-guess there
i- i-is a pa-pa-party around here?
Yes, something like that. Do you know
a public-bath around here?
Yes of course sir. Be-be-behind
the plane tree.
I would have seen it, because just next
to that stands the mansion of my wife...
Wha-wha-what?
- I say my wife Hürmüz!
Name of my wi-wi-wife is also Hürmüz
but... Sh-sh she...
Don't touch!
She's a housemaid in the ma-man-mansion.
In the mansion of Lady Hürmüz?
- No-no-no!
Still touching!
I see I see, your wife is a housemaid
in somebody else's mansion.
Pa-pa-Pasha...
Come on...
- Pa-pa-pasha's mansion.
Thanks my brother, you shaved very well.
Bu-but it's not over sir.
I liked your performance. I am the
wild boy of this area from now on.
And this is your tip. Give me the hat.
- But...
I will be your customer from now on,
I am the wild boy of the area.
I will come very often,
I liked the way you shave. Good bye.
Go go god ble bless you.
Look at that charming girl,
did she move to this area recently?
I came!
I am Havva, we danced together
in the baths party.
Yeah, I just recognized. Come on.
Come on girl, I recognized you.
Welcome girl!
You bring me luck!
- Why? What happened?
I am getting married, what else?
Sorry but, aren't you married already?
Doesn't matter. I will get divorced
and get married to the new one.
Then how will we find the slut?
I am very busy now.
Let's do it tomorrow, OK?
But... I came here just for this reason.
But listen, you will be very
comfortable here.
