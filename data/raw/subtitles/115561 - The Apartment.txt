Look at this one. Simple,
yet majestic. Sober,
but far from common.
Its charm resides in its solemnity.
This one is more whimsical.
More titillating.
But don't brush against it.
You may hurt yourself.
It's made to be caressed
only by the eyes.
More discreet than the last one
and yet full of surprises.
It may seem dull,
but in another light,
it will glow like a star.
Look how it sparkles!
Amazing, isn't it?
Yes... I don't know.
I like all three.
Can I call you?
The Japanese are waiting for you
at the ''Pergola''.
Yes, I know.
I'm late. Go on, brief me.
Okay, then...
- Check in at 7 p.m.
- Arrival?
Tokyo. 2 p.m. tomorrow, local time.
After a night at the Meridien,
you take Fumiko's jet the next day.
That's a cute suit.
The taxi's waiting.
You come back the 24th.
The 24th?
That's four days.
- 4 days without you.
- Call back the jeweler.
Farewell, Madeleine.
Max?
- Lucien!
- Is it really you?
You cut your hair, handsome!
Not in New York?
I came back.
How long ago?
Don't get mad. 2 months.
You couldn't call?
Don't take it badly.
Let me explain.
I'm getting married.
You're kidding?
Her name's Muriel.
We met in New York.
Cut the crap!
I swear it's true.
I'm coming! Pain in the ass!
I'm double-parked. I better go.
I'm off to Japan.
I'll call you after.
ln two years.
I may give up the shop,
so take my card...
as a souvenir.
I'm away 4 days. Call you in 5!
Excuse me.
Mr Noda, Miss Tami. Max Mayer.
It's a pleasure.
For me too.
Tell Mr Noda to get his pen ready.
Max is our man!
Max is a real ace.
He's exaggerating.
Hello.
Meet my sister, Muriel.
Mr Noda. Miss Tami.
- No one can do without Mr Mayer.
- Enough, Alain.
Here. Take one for the plane.
[ Skipped item nr. 59 ]
We really should go now.
He has a flight to catch.
To our project!
Mr Noda is toasting the marriage...
of our two companies.
Sorry, I have to make a call.
Where are you?
Weren't we supposed to meet?
I have to see you
as soon as possible.
No, you listen to me.
I'm leaving you.
That's why I'm calling.
For me, when it's over, it's over.
There's nothing to explain.
I saw it in the papers.
I don't think it was an accident.
Daniel, I was wrong to call you.
Goodbye.
Lisa?
Are you okay, Miss?
Mr Noda would like to pay.
It's on me.
[ Skipped item nr. 77 ]
[ Skipped item nr. 78 ]
He needs the microphone for Monday.
That's impossible!
I still need the VCR.
What do you want me to do?
Fredo, figure it out!
You've gone too far this time!
So?
It'll take hours to repair.
I'll never finish by Wednesday.
When is it for?
Wednesday, I think.
[ Skipped item nr. 89 ]
I'm sorry!
- Hi, Michelle.
- How are you, Lisa?
Demetrius loves you fair.
O happy fair!
I despise your eyes,
more fiery than the stars.
I hate your voice,
sweeter than the lark's song
Sickness is catching.
O, were favor so!
Then breathing the air you breathe,
My ear should catch your voice,
my eye your eye.
And I will snatch Demetrius
from you
using your very smile.
- Max? What are you doing?
- Nothing.
Hurry, we only have half an hour.
[ Skipped item nr. 103 ]
What?
Think about me.
Call me when you get in.
I'll call tomorrow.

Put me through to room 413.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry. Room 413 has asked
not to be disturbed.
- Any message?
- This is urgent.
- I need to speak to her.
- I have my orders.
I can't help you any further.
Thanks anyway.
You're welcome.
Excuse me.
It's my fault.
Room 413.
First corridor on the right.
[ Skipped item nr. 123 ]
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.
Straighten your leg.
You have extraordinary ankles.
You should show them off.
Can I see them in brown?
I'd never wear these.
Just a minute.
I met someone.
- That's great. Who?
- An amazing girl.
- Yeah? So?
- Nothing yet. She's...
She's a brunette. Very dark.
The strong-willed, tenacious type.
A high forehead.
Black eyes. Jet black.
There's something special about her.
There's something sad,
something tragic in her eyes.
Did you talk to her?
That's the problem.
She doesn't know I exist.
I've followed her for days.
I feel like a pervert.
This can't go on.
That's for sure.
Josiane!
Where are the Stadlers?
Right in front of you.
I'm obsessed. I can't sleep.
I skipped work yesterday.
Lucien, what should I do?
Pull yourself together.
Then either get her or forget her.
Thanks a real lot...
Choosing a woman
and wanting only her
means abandoning all the others.
It's stupid.
It's cowardly.
Lucien...
Look around you.
Each and every one is special.
Look at my salesgirls.
That pudgy one.
Or the brunette outside.
I spend my days at my clients' feet.
Why else would I do this job?
[ Skipped item nr. 159 ]
Show me the shoes in the window.
The ones in the corner. Size 37.
Max, please see to the young lady.
Ask what color.
- What's your size?
- 37. Do you have them in red?
ln red? I don't know.
Maybe you can go see.
Red, red, 37 red, 37 red...
- 37 red.
- Attack! Go for it!
They seem fine.
I'll take the same ones in red.
ln red? Well, uh...
I'm sorry.
We're out of red.
- Too bad.
- It sure is.
But it doesn't matter because...
we'd be happy to... Just leave me...
Leave us your phone number and...
Do you often spy on people?
Excuse me?
Don't play dumb.
Do you enjoy following me?
Do you have lots of time to kill?
[ Skipped item nr. 183 ]
You're mistaken. Let me...
Let me buy you a coffee.
Please, just let me...
No explanations. No coffee.
Give me a call
when the shoes come in.
Red ones... Goodbye.
Tomorrow at 7
at the caf' on the Rue de Paradis.
No need to keep spying. Lisa.
It lasted a year.
That's the way I am.
I fall in and out of love.
As if I were double. Or triple.
Or whimsical.
That's a nice word.
There's nothing worse
than blandness.
Do you have a little maxim
for everything?
Let's talk about you for a change.
I'm waiting...
Waiting...
I may be offered a job
in New York that would...
But what I really want to do
is to write.
A writer.
Half a writer.
- I've written half a book.
- Can I read it?
- Once it's finished.
- Soon, I hope.
I'm not as patient as you.
[ Skipped item nr. 210 ]
I had a really nice day.
So long.
What an ass!
Tragic Weekend
We have a problem with room 413.
Daniel de FouqiSres,
famed art dealer, lost his wife
in a car accident Friday
near their country house.
The funeral is on Tuesday
at 4 o'clock
at the PSre Lachaise crematorium.
I saw it in the papers.
I don't think it was an accident.
Open this door, you idiots!
She's gone! An entire week!
Stupid idiots!
See if she left something!
Hurry up!
Excuse me, sir.
- I found something by the phone.
- What is it?
Keys.
A woman forgot them yesterday.
- What time was it?
- Around...
6 o'clock.
A shapely brunette.
On her way out,
she broke her heel.
- That's her.
- She walked out barefoot.
Totally classy.
No problem. Give me the keys.
[ Skipped item nr. 237 ]
lf she comes back for them...
can you give her this note?
No problem, sir.
Why are you here?
- Do you have a second?
- Now?
Paola, finish up here.
- Your place?
- You're not in Tokyo?
I never left.
I found Lisa!
So after two years,
you still love her?
I just want to try to...
Shit.
I dropped it.
You're never careful.
Sorry.
We can always replace the mirror.
I need to know why
she left without an explanation.
Why do this to yourself?
Aren't you getting married?
- What are you after?
- Nothing... I don't know.
I just have to find her!
Yeah, I see.
Don't try to understand. Help me.
Not my car!
Please.
lf I go to the funeral,
I may find Lisa.
Anyway, you never listen.
- Thanks.
- Bring it back by 7.
I'm seeing a brunette tonight.
You hear me?
I fell for a brunette
as if she were a blonde.
Shocking, huh?
AgnSs de FouquiSres
has brutally left us.
She is gone forever.
Let us remember her face.
Her eyes, mouth and forehead
will lose their beauty,
grace and color.
For our body is earth
and cannot be reborn.
Life fades
as rain vanishes into the grass.
We are nothing but ash.
All that remains is memory.
The memory of what was
and which will be no longer.
AgnSs,
you will remain in our souls.
You are in Heaven,
far from life's torments.
You see our pain,
you hear our cries.
Farewell.
Receive our tears
so that alive and dead,
your body is but roses.
I'd like to pick up some keys...
[ Skipped item nr. 291 ]
Lisa?
- What'll it be?
- A glass of wine.
Lisa, I've lost you.
I don't know why.
I've left your keys in your mailbox.
Let me see you one more time.
One last time. My love,
call me. I love you. Daniel.
Shit!
You're a real pain.
I'm sorry. I really am.
Give me my keys.
- Now I know where she lives.
- You saw her?
No, I left her a note
to meet me tomorrow.
Great. It's settled.
Don't brood. I'm sorry.
I'm thinking. Can't I?
You're an hour and a half late!
Thanks to you,
I missed seeing Alice.
What can I say?
Why don't you go now?
- She's hardly the kind to wait.
- Shit!
- Lucien?
- It's Alice.
- Yes, Alice.
- Who are you kidding?
- I've been waiting.
- Can I explain?
I didn't have my car.
I lent it to...
You lent it out
when we have a date? Why?
Because...
Listen, cut the crap.
Sure, have a nice night!
Come here!
I'm Max, Lucien's friend.
It's all my fault.
Alice... let me explain.
He didn't lend me his car.
I stole the keys.
Great. #At least#
it's an amusing explanation.
No, it's stupid.
I was totally distraught.
Sorry, I didn't mean to...
No, it's me.
I was looking for someone.
A woman. It's perfectly banal.
Did you find her?.
Almost.
I'll put Lucien back on.
Alice, you're really sweet...
Your friend is weird.
Yeah, he's a real sap.
Are you still coming?
At 10, after the rehearsal.
See you then, honey.
I love you.
What goes better, gray or black?
The gray one.
What are you doing?
I had a crazy day. I'm bushed.
You're in my bed.
Aren't you? Isn't that my bed?
Sorry, but it's too small for three.
Can't you go to her place?
She never invites me.
She's a little...
Forget about it.
It's complicated... for once.
- It's not like you.
- No, it's not.
Shall we go?
So you're in love.
Turn off the lights when you leave.
[ Skipped item nr. 354 ]
So you're kicking me out, right?
I love thee not. Pursue me not.
My heart will not obey.
It is a compass
pointing in but one direction.
Leave your power to draw,
I'll have no power to follow you.
Do I entice you?
Demetrius, wait. I beg of you.
I tell you I will never love you.
And even for that, I do love you
the more. I am your spaniel.
Beat me, I will fawn on you.
Alice!
This is lousy.
Can you tell me what's wrong?
You're inert. Helena is
madly in love at this point!
Enough with her goddamned dress!
Get lost!
What's your problem?
You know what love is?
You're cold.
We open in two days. Wake up.
That goes for everyone!
It's the pills you gave me
for the flight.
I slept in my clothes.
I just woke up.
Max, I feel like you're so close.
You're thousands of miles away
and you sound nearby.
It's true. It's really strange.
I miss you, honey.
Is it nice out?
It's night.
What do you mean?
Isn't it 7 a.m. in Tokyo?
Of course it is.
I'm such an idiot.
I haven't opened the... shutters.
I'm sorry. I'm just... tired.
Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll be hard to get in touch with.
Can you tell your brother...
Nothing. That things are fine. Okay?
Lisa, I found your powder case.
Meet me at 10 at the usual place.
I'll be waiting for you. Max.
Water is like time.
It whirls by all the time.
Water is like time
It whirls and swirls...
Water is like time.
It whirls by all the time.
Lisa!
What are you doing here?
I needed to talk to you.
Are you coming?
- I'll meet you there.
- Hurry.
I tried calling, but it was
always busy. I knew you'd be...
So I... How are you?
So?
Let's find a better...
You want to have a drink?
Whatever you want.
I was just offered
a job in New York.
That's great.
Not bad. A big computer company.
It's really well-paid.
Three months ago,
I wouldn't have hesitated.
Why?
Maybe because
I hadn't met you yet.
What will you do?
It depends on tons of stuff.
It's hard to pick up and leave.
You have to...
You want to share
an apartment with me?
Hold on...
Me and you in the same apartment.
Me and you...
Sorry, I'm in a rush.
Will you pay?
Sure...
Lisa...
Do you want to live with me?
I have to rehearse.
They're waiting.
Wait, Lisa...
Tomorrow.
Same time, same place.
Okay.
Goodbye.
Two months? You're sure?
Yes. They left yesterday.
- Around noon.
- She didn't tell me.
She replaced someone.
Do you want a phone number?
Come on, stop.
I don't want to.
Lisa!
Lisa, don't!
Don't let me go!
I have you!
I'm falling!
[ Skipped item nr. 439 ]
Drink this.
Leave me alone!
Relax, please!
You've ruined everything.
Yeah, right.
- Don't touch me.
- I'll put it here.
It's a handkerchief for you.
- Use it if you want to.
- What are you doing here?
[ Skipped item nr. 448 ]
I'm waiting.
I'm a friend of Lisa's.
A friend of Lisa's.
Is that supposed to be funny?
No, I'm serious.
My name is Lisa. I live here.
I have no friends like you.
Stop it. What do you want?
Do you live alone here?
Don't touch me!
I'll scream my lungs out!
Seriously, you can trust me.
Okay, okay, don't bother.
I'll sit right here.
ln a little corner.
I won't move. I'm calm.
Now let me explain.
[ Skipped item nr. 462 ]
I came to find someone.
You see the letter there?
You wrote it?
Did you read it?
Did you really find my powder case?
Was it you at the caf'?
Wednesday? Yeah, I was there.
What is this about?
My powder case.
Thanks.
Wait... What's wrong? Wait.
This will do you good.
I thought you were someone else.
A girl I knew.
I was crazy about her.
The guy in the Jaguar?
I think he killed his wife for me.
That wasn't very nice.
I should go now.
ln fact, I will.
It's pouring. You'll get soaked.
Wait till it's over.
I should be in Tokyo
with a millionaire.
You're responsible for my life now.
I can't take care of you.
I have to go.
Look at yourself.
I can't let you leave.
You'll jump in front of a car.
You'll never sleep there.
Don't be stupid.
Come next to me.
I'll be fine.
I've learned
to adapt to weird situations.
Let's try to sleep.
Good morning.
You want a coffee?
I think you need one.
I'm totally out of it too.
Come to think of it...
I'm going to take a shower.
Do you want tea or coffee?
I broke all my cups.
It's original.
One sugar or two?
One.
To us.
