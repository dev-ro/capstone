â™ª A bunch of secrets,
Stay close and I'll tell you. â™ª
â™ª With one eye full of mischief
And the other full of sorrow... â™ª
â™ª With the tricks of those eyes
I've stolen you.... â™ª
â™ª What did you steal?
I stole beauty. â™ª
â™ª Whose beauty?
The song's beauty. â™ª
â™ª Which song?
Your song. â™ª
â™ª Which you?
My you... â™ª
â™ª The murmur of wild weaver ants
The music of "Karumaram" buzzes in her heart. â™ª
â™ª The rain over the sea
Drizzles in her heart. â™ª
â™ª She gets drenched
The earth chills... â™ª
â™ª She unfurls
The ground gets soaked... â™ª
â™ª She gets drenched
The earth chills... â™ª
â™ª She unfurls
The ground gets soaked... â™ª
â™ª The song swells
The dance intensifies... â™ª
â™ª The trumpet music
reverberates... â™ª
â™ª The trumpet music
reverberates... â™ª
â™ª She dances with open hair... â™ª
â™ª With her tricks,
She steals heart. â™ª
â™ª What did you steal?
I stole beauty. â™ª
â™ª Whose beauty?
The song's beauty. â™ª
â™ª Which song?
Your song. â™ª
â™ª Which you?
My you... â™ª
- You didn't lose your way, did you?
- No, we followed the map.
Come in.
Shall we give these two
some privacy to talk?
That too is a custom.
I was about to suggest that.
I'm not sure what two strangers
like us should talk about.
Same here.
- Where did you do your studies?
- Sorry?
Where did you study?
- Where in Bahrain were you?
- Manama
Manama.
- The boy's cousin was in Manama too.
- Really?
- Do you know his uncle?
- No.
Mr. PK Radhakrishnan.
He was the District Judge.
- Oh, yes yes.
- Do you know his elder uncle?
Mr. Raghavan Master.
He retired as the school principal.
- You must have seen in the newspaper.
- Yes, I remember now.
Hey, tell everyone
to come quickly.
Pour some water.
Come up this way.
Wash the bride's feet now.
Now perform the welcome ritual.
Now give her the lamp.
Enter with your right foot first.
With your right foot please.
Carefully...
Aunt, it's your turn now.
It's okay to eat something sweet today.
Have a bit more.
Some more.
Thank you.
- You said it.
- Wait and watch. It's just the beginning.
You call this tea?
And they serve this to everyone here?
I have to leave in the morning.
- Can't you stay back for two days?
- I have left so much to do back there.
You will be doing your sister a favour.
- Did you get bored waiting?
- A bit.
- I was busy, that's why.
- Okay.
- Did you like this home and my family?
- Yes.
- What about my parents?
- Yeah, I like them.
- Feeling at home already?
- Yes.
What else?
What else...
Sit down.
- Are you scared of darkness?
- Sorry?
I mean, do you fear darkness?
It will be either Sambar or Chutney
in my home, not both.
Folks here want both.
His dad wants the chutney
hand ground.
Every family has its practices, right?
Milk.
Too much chaos yesterday.
Photographers and guests...
I could barely see you.
Saw you now.
You are so beautiful!
What's the name of this beauty?
Janaki.
I have classes today. Got to go.
See you tomorrow.
Please. Mom might see us.
I have run out of leave.
Otherwise we would have had a good time.
We don't need a separate honeymoon.
Do we?
It's honeymoon for us from now on.
Speak softly.
Mom will hear us.
Is it too hot?
It's okay.
I will go freshen up. Okay?
Hey. They are here, OK?
Come in.
Have some tapioca.
- Do you eat beef?
- Yeah.
- Did you say beef?
- Yes, I made it outside.
We were eating beef
only when we dine out.
Now it has reached the courtyard.
It will enter the kitchen soon.
Just that my mom is here.
Aren't you joining us?
We will eat later.
Guests first.
You join us, dear. Come.
She will eat with me.
You guys eat, please.
Please eat.
- It's not too spicy, right?
- Not at all.
Mom...
Hey, how was the dinner tonight?
It was fine.
I am so full.
Really?
I'll change and join you.
It's okay. I can do this.
You may go to bed.
I'll help.
No, I can manage this.
You leave.
I will take leave then.
Okay, dear. Bye.
Shall we?
The tapioca biriyani is
making me lethargic.
- Let me cheer you up.
- Sure?
- Mom.
- Yes.
- How do I chop the ladies finger?
- As you like.
- Is this okay?
- Yes, it is.
You sit, dear.
I am here, right?
Come, sit.
No, I will eat with you, mom.
Oh!
Mom too needs some company, right?
Dear...
Hey, I am leaving.
Yes, mom.
I had gone to the doctor.
Things are okay.
He advised rest.
So, you must come soon.
Can't I come in your seventh month?
Don't wait so long.
Come soon.
No, dear. I'm worried about stuff here.
There is someone now
to manage all that.
I'll call you in two days
after booking tickets.
Be ready to come soon.
Well, do whatever you like.
Was it sister?
Yes, it was her.
Are the mangoes over?
There's more. I'll get them
after checking the porridge.
- Don't fry it too much.
- Sure.
Dad, here is your tea.
I haven't brushed, dear.
Then you brush first.
I will heat it up again.
I haven't got my brush.
The toothbrush...
Just get it for him.
He is our dad, after all.
If you have a problem,
I'll do it.
- No, I will do it.
- I can.
- Let me...
- I will...
- Can you get me some hot dosa?
- Let me get it.
Here you go, dear.
- Dear...
- Yes
Didn't you grind the chutney by hand?
No, dad.
I used the mixer.
No problem.
Don't strain yourself doing it by hand.
Hey, I'm leaving.
Come here.
I am completely filthy, dear.
It's okay.
Come closer.
Mom, how many whistles
for 'Kuruva' rice?
Alright. I will talk to you later.
Okay then.
What happened, buddy?
Didn't the new bride
pack anything to eat?
She is new here.
Shouldn't we give her some time?
Absolutely. I was just kidding.
I wonder how long such niceties last.
Teacher, please.
- Did you cook the rice in the cooker?
- Yes
Oh.
Cook the rice on the fire, okay?
Yeah, you can serve.
Have some curry.
Yeah, I ate lunch.
I couldn't enjoy it.
I've always hated eating out.
Tell her to cook only the rice on firewood.
Sorry, dear. I will pack you lunch
from tomorrow.
Why don't you adjust to
rice made in cooker?
Dear, can you eat rice for dinner?
Evenings we eat flatbread, right?
No, I got some leftover rice from lunch.
It doesn't matter.
Flatbread is healthier.
Yeah, that's how it is.
When you eat freshly cooked breakfast.
I eat the leftover food from last night.
You are a member of that household now.
Get used to their ways.
Okay, I will call you back.
Okay, that's enough.
Hello.
Hello.
I got something for you.
What's that?
- Do you like guava?
- Yes.
These are for you.
Wait. I will make some tea for you.
- Do you know what I hate the most?
- No, tell me.
Tea with milk.
- Spend some time here.
- If I go late, mom will scold me.
I have to go to school.
See you tomorrow.
Bye.
Oh, no.
Dear...
Dear...
Hello. Yes, dear.
Tell me.
What's up?
Nothing great.
Tell me about you.
You know why I called you...
This Sunday, at 7 in the evening
I am performing at the Town Hall.
That's great.
You must come with your husband.
Sure.
It's a Sunday. Tell him not to commit
to any other programme.
I will tell him.
- See you on Sunday.
- See you.
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.
- How is the black tea?
- Awesome.
I'm thinking of cooking
an instant Biriyani.
- Today?
- Yeah.
No Biriyani today.
You know what?
It's the fourth time this week
you are cooking non vegetarian food.
Come on, Anki.
As long as that beef is in the fridge...
How can I sit in peace?
Let it stay there.
Why are you getting restless about it?
You will stop cribbing when you eat it.
I am going to cook anyway.
Okay?
Do whatever you want.
- Dear...
- Yeah.
If you wash in the machine...
...won't the clothes wear out fast?
Don't wash mine in that.
- Dear, the plumber didn't turn up.
- What?
The plumber...
Sorry, I forgot about it.
Don't worry.
I will get it done.
My goodness.
- Dear...
- Hmm?
I am on my period.
- You didn't make tea, right?
- No.
I will buy some breakfast for us.
I will tell Usha to make lunch.
She will come.
- I have run out of sanitary pads.
- What?
Will you buy some pads for me?
I will.
You relax.
We don't have to cook breakfast today.
So I thought I will mop the floor.
By the time we clean this house,
we will break our back.
You are right.
I am lucky on that count.
My house has only two rooms
and a tiny kitchen.
Oh, please don't touch it.
I will wipe the floor.
It's okay.
- At this time...
- What about this time?
True that.
How can we live
following such old practices?
My mom was not even
allowed inside the house.
She used to do some work outside.
You know what...
Even during my period,
I go to cook at houses.
If I skip work for
3 or 4 days a month...
How can I feed the family?
I have to send my kids to school.
How would someone
know whether I have it?
You are awesome.
What choice do I have, my dear?
â™ª A bunch of secrets,
Stay close and I'll tell you. â™ª
â™ª With one eye full of mischief
And the other full of sorrow... â™ª
â™ª With the tricks of those eyes
I've stolen you.... â™ª
â™ª What did you steal?
I stole beauty. â™ª
â™ª Whose beauty?
The song's beauty. â™ª
â™ª Which song?
Your song. â™ª
â™ª Which you?
My you... â™ª
I'll get hot water for you.
In today's class, we are
going to discuss about 'Family'.
It is the simplest and basic group
in our society.
In other words, the most important
social institution in our society is...
...the family.
What is the definition of a family?
Family is a durable association of
husband and wife, with or without children.
We all are part of the society.
Aren't we?
What are the characteristics of a family?
The characteristics of a family?
The characteristics of a family..
One: Family is a universal group.
Two: Family is based on marriage.
Food has been served.
- I'll get you some water.
- I'll get it myself.
No way. If dad comes to know,
both of us will get an earful. I'll bring.
Dad...
Just a bit.
It's hot.
- Dear...
- Yeah?
Shall I apply for a job?
Job?
Nice...
- What job, dear?
- Teacher.
- Teaching what?
- Dance.
Dance?
Nice...
That won't suit us, dear.
The chickpea dish is marvellous!
Don't worry.
We'll do something about it.
For now, don't apply.
We'll do something.
You apply, dear. We don't know
whether you'll be selected.
- If you are, let's see then.
- OK.
Dear, don't tell anyone it's my idea.
- No, mom.
- Keeping, then.
So, outside the home
you follow table manners.
- What's it?
- Yeah?
- What did you say?
- Table manners...
What's wrong at home?
What's wrong with
my manners at home?
Here you are throwing away
the waste properly. At home...
What's wrong with that?
My home, my convenience.
I'll do as I please.
Got it?
I was just saying that.
Why are you getting angry?
If you say such things,
won't one get angry?
What's wrong with my manners?
These are the kind of manners I have.
Got it?
Dear...
Why are you not talking to me?
Are you angry?
Do you think what you told me is right?
I was just saying that.
I wasn't serious at all.
Is this the biggest fault
you saw in me?
I didn't mean as a fault.
While sitting there, I just...
Don't justify.
If you feel what you said
is wrong, apologise to me.
Sorry.
Hey...
Hello...
Come here, you well-mannered lady!
Mrs. Manners!
Come.
Dear...
Can you ask that plumber to come?
The waste water in the kitchen
is causing big trouble.
Seems like you have
a big problem with waste.
Let's see...
- Hey!
- Yeah!
Come here quickly.
We have some guests.
What? Am I a guest to you?
Where are you coming from?
Her mom's aunt's grandson - Deepak.
You know him, right?
It was his wedding.
At Guruvayoor temple.
We had come for that.
She has a swelling on her leg
for the last few days.
Thought of consulting at Kottakkal hospital.
So we went there too.
Then thought of visiting all of you.
If possible, should go to
Mookambika temple also. That's it.
Why is it swelling?
Don't know.
Must be arthritis.
Only if the swelling subsides,
the Mookambika plan...
- Hey, do you remember who I am?
- I understood.
Then tell me who I am.
Hey, you don't help her, OK?
You tell me.
Elder uncle's son.
Hey, she just saw me
for a short while...
- You had spoken for a while...
- Yeah, right...
She has a very good memory.
Nice, it's very nice!
Dear, don't we have milk?
Make some tea.
Make tea. But no need of milk.
Make it black tea.
- Milk is there.
- Not that, I prefer black tea.
You never allow anyone to make
a proper tea. Why can't you have it?
Dear, you bring a proper tea.
We should look at two aspects.
Listen...
One is the taste,
the other is digestion.
About taste, she is right.
Milk will add to the taste.
But when it comes to digestion,
black tea is healthier.
So bring that...
- You bring whichever you prefer, dear.
- I'll bring both. No problem.
Why trouble her unnecessarily?
We all could have just had black tea.
Why didn't you come to
aunt's housewarming?
How will I come? I don't have any leaves.
It was exam time at school.
Is it?
Are you planning to go
to Sabarimala this year?
- Of course I am. Should go this time.
- Uncle, are you going?
Of course!
Remember us running away with the sweet
from the temple and uncle beating us.
- Do you remember?
- You were the one who got more than me.
Yeah, I beat really hard.
- I didn't want.
- I've made it anyway.
What is this, dear?
You call this black tea?
Is this what all of you were
having as black tea so far?
Dear...
Black tea is not just some
tea powder and sugar in water.
Black tea should have...
a little cardamom...
a bit of cinnamon...
some clove...
a little fenugreek...
Then why don't you add some
garam masala and rice to make it a biriyani!
- That's right...
- All she can think of is eating.
But everything she eats goes
to her leg and it swells up.
So next time, make it like that, OK?
It's not bad.
Then let the dinner be
chicken curry and flatbread.
- Yeah, we have chicken.
- Chicken curry, is it?
I'll cook. Why not?
OK, let it be like this.
The women can take rest today.
We boys will take over the kitchen today.
Dear...
- Shall I help you?
- It's OK. You are not well.
Then let me lie down.
Do you need black tea?
Dear, bring two black tea.
- You got it?
- Yes!
[Burping]
You either take it. Or place another.
How long it's been...
Added cardamom, right?
Now it has become tea!
Now if someone asks you who taught to
make good tea, what will you say?
You.
- Come on sit. Let's play Twenty-eight.
- No, I have some work in the kitchen.
What? What work is there
in the kitchen now?
Didn't we do all the work?
- I've struck...
- Damn, you struck my lone card!
Dear...
- Dear...
- Ya, dad. Coming.
- What's it, dad?
- What's this, dear?
It's the interview letter.
Didn't we decide not to apply?
My wife is a post graduate.
She wished to work.
But I listened to my dad.
Because of that, all the children
are in very good positions.
Having a woman at home
is very auspicious for the family.
What you do is much greater than
what bureaucrats and ministers do.
Ask your mom.
She'll tell you the same.
It's all fine.
Don't worry...
Hey.
Hadn't I told you
not to apply for the job?
Haven't I lost face
in front of my dad now?
Have I ever told you that
I won't allow you to work?
Have I?
Haven't I told you everything
before marriage?
No one has told me anything.
Ask your parents whether
I had told them.
Where are your manners
in this matter?
Switch off the light.
Need to sleep.
Lead kindly light...
I'm going to take the vow for
the Sabarimala pilgrimage.
When are you going?
Haven't decided the date.
But will start abstinence tomorrow.
Only after coming back
we can be together like this.
Right?
Can we switch off the light?
Will you feel bad
if I say something?
What's it?
It really hurts when we do it.
If there's some foreplay,
I will be...
So, you know everything about it...
What?
Foreplay...
I should feel something
towards you, for foreplay...
Switch off the light.
â™ª The girl is so beautiful,
Her breasts so ravishing... â™ª
â™ª Her hair so long,
Lovely eyes like a deer... â™ª
â™ª Of the "Paraya" community,
From the "Velliyam" clan... â™ª
â™ª She cooks tapioca well,
And delicious fish too... â™ª
Hail to thee,
Lord Ayyappa!
Protect us...
Hail to Ayyappa,
Son of Harihara!
Isn't this dish from yesterday?
Yes.
It is refrigerated and reheated.
It's fine.
God save us!
Don't you know pilgrims shouldn't be
served the previous day's food?
Did you do this deliberately?
I swear I didn't know about it.
You didn't know
about this until now?
Great!
Don't things change with time?
For instance, avoiding footwear.
You can get many diseases these days.
I know people who drink during the abstinence.
Don't give too much importance to all this.
[Chanting prayers]
Food is served!
Hail to Ayyappa,
Son of Harihara!
Brother...
What's all this?
Is all this true?
- Don't her parents have any responsibility?
- What can I say?
I came leaving behind a lot of things.
How can I not come hearing this?
Where is she?
What is this?
You sleep on a bed?
Hasn't anyone told you
not to sleep on a bed?
You should only sleep on
something that can be washed.
Can't you move to a relative's place?
Or to the outhouse?
I'm scared.
What's there to be scared of?
Are you a child?
Move aside.
What to do with this bed now?
Here's the spread.
Lie down on the floor.
It's very delicious.
I just managed something in a hurry.
Just like how mom used to cook...
Give me some of that dish.
Have your meal.
When you're done,
wash the plates and keep it here.
Don't meet anyone or go out.
Lead kindly light...
Hail, Lord Krishna...
We don't follow such customs
because your dad was abroad.
If they follow them,
consider yourself lucky.
You obey what they say.
Why don't you understand
what I say, mom?
You've become part of
such a prestigious family...
...the Supreme court has
made it quite clear.
Actually what is happening here is
a violation of constitution.
Some political parties
have also joined to support it.
It can only be viewed as
a failure of democracy.
While the court has stated that
menstruation isn't impure,
...some people are
repeating it is so.
Wash everything that you have used,
including the spread, in running water.
Put your washed clothes
away from those of others.
Burn the sanitary pads,
don't leave them lying around.
Don't evoke the wrath of the Snake God.
After seven days, purify
everything you used with holy water.
Don't think Gulf returnees are
exempted from God's wrath.
What's this?
Don't you know you shouldn't touch
the Holy Basil plant during this time?
But I caught a cold...
God save us!
Dear, can I borrow Rs.500?
I can't touch anything here.
You can take it from my purse
inside my table drawer.
OK. And, how are you doing?
I am very good.
You take what you want.
OK.
Why have you hung your inner wear
where they can see them?
For them to dry...
Why can't you hang them
in the backyard?
Isn't it unhygienic if
they aren't dried well?
What an oration!
Keep the milk there
and close the door...
- OK.
- Go.
Sister...
Sister...
What's it?
Where are you?
I'm here...
- I have something to show you.
- What's it?
I've taken the vow for pilgrimage.
I'm a holy one now.
Oh, don't come here.
- Why not?
- Don't come!
Why did you tell me
not to come?
I've come to give you something.
Do you like it?
You leave.
See you later.
Hail to thee, Ayyappa!
There's no refuge other than you.
Hail to thee,
Son of Harihara!
There's no refuge other than you.
Oh no...
Dear...
Go away.
Don't you know you shouldn't
touch the pilgrims during this time?
Pity!
God save us!
If made impure by the touch of a menstruating lady,
you should swallow fresh cow dung.
Else, purify yourself by
drinking cow dung water.
That's how it is...
You don't take so much trouble.
Just take bath in a river...
Women shouldn't see this Supreme court order
as something concerning just temple entry.
It is the declaration of our freedom.
The declaration that we are slaves to nobody.
They hope they can chain women forever
under their control in the house and kitchen.
I'm leaving tonight itself
because it's urgent.
Tomorrow is the seventh day. You can
purify yourself and enter the kitchen.
Do everything carefully.
Bye, then.
Come out,
you feminist bitch!
She hasn't seen real men, that's what.
Come out, We'll show you.
Come out, you...
Don't worry, it's OK.
Come out,
let's see you.
You know to show off
only on Facebook? Come out!
Torch it!
Tell her to delete it from her mobile.
Does her behavior befit
well brought up women?
Weren't you the head of our community's
local chapter for a while?
Isn't it shameful that
we ourselves do such an offence?
Did you see the abuses
in the comments under that video?
This is a big shame for all of us.
That's why we came now itself.
Don't worry.
She will delete it.
- Ya, that's enough!
- Yes, that'll do.
Let's take leave.
Meet you in the morning.
Delete the video
you shared on Facebook.
I shared because I felt it's right.
I won't delete it.
I am asking you to delete it.
What's it to you
if I have shared it?
If I come in, I'll...
You, coming in here?
As if you can...
Can you see me?
Touch me?
You can't do anything to me.
If you want to live in this house,
you'll have to listen to us.
Dear...
- Will you close that door?
- Sure.
Bolt it from outside.
Dear...
Tea for eight people.
Hail to thee...
Ayyappa!
Hail the son of Harihara...
Hail to thee...
Ayyappa!
It's been a while
since we asked for tea.
Did you make the tea?
I'll bring now.
Hurry up.
[Religious chants]
You...
- Hail to thee... Ayyappa!
- Hail to thee... Ayyappa!
MOVEMENT FOR PRESERVATION
OF RELIGIOUS CUSTOMS
You walked out of there
for such a silly thing?
Come, I'll take you back.
Apologise and go back
to that house.
I'm not going anywhere.
- Then what do you intend to do?
- Sis, when have you come?
- Mom, give me some water.
- Bring him some water.
Sit down there!
Why can't you get the water yourself?
In your royal proclamation, you can have
the kingdom, wars and blood.
But for us, you have left
only love, sacrifice and patience.
I am not like those women you had
imprisoned in your proclamation so long.
I am the flame that rose up
from the hardships you inflicted.
Fire!
- Good morning!
- Good morning, Teacher!
All set?
OK, no?
If anyone is feeling uncomfortable with
the costume or ornaments, let me know.
- So get ready for the final rehearsal.
- Yes!
My life till now was
actually a rehearsal.
Our life from now on
will rectify those mistakes.
Isn't it?
The tea is excellent!
Let me freshen up and come.
â™ª You are Earth's music, its form
When you personify valour... â™ª
â™ª A flame that refuses to be put out
You light up this world! â™ª
â™ª These worldly fetters... â™ª
â™ª You release from them all... â™ª
â™ª Bestower of life,
Oh woman thee... â™ª
â™ª You are Earth's music, its form
When you personify valour... â™ª
â™ª A flame that refuses to be put out
You light up this world! â™ª
â™ª Still many great stories
Left to narrate but... â™ª
â™ª ...time will not suffice
Oh girl, march on! â™ª
â™ª Enough of your grief! â™ª
â™ª With your wisdom, if you awaken
Your inner self, you are a relentless stream... â™ª
â™ª Spread on across this world... â™ª
â™ª You are a woman,
the strongest! â™ª
â™ª Against the dust from your feet,
Even heaven pales... â™ª
â™ª Like the great sun
and the dazzling stars... â™ª
â™ª Let this radiant face
Rule forever... â™ª
â™ª You are Earth's music, its form
When you personify valour... â™ª
â™ª A flame that refuses to be put out
You light up this world! â™ª
â™ª The girl is so beautiful,
Her breasts so ravishing... â™ª
â™ª Her hair so long,
Lovely eyes like a deer... â™ª
â™ª Of the "Paraya" community,
From the "Velliyam" clan... â™ª
â™ª She cooks tapioca well,
And delicious fish too... â™ª
â™ª On her period
Defying custom... â™ª
â™ª She'll be red with betel
Taken with a dab of lime... â™ª
â™ª As the sun goes down
Her radiance grows... â™ª
â™ª The beats get louder
The dusk approaches... â™ª
