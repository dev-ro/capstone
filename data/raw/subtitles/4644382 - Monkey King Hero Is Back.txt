It was said a long time ago there was a Monkey King known as Sun Wukong.
He was known to have vast magical power.
He once wreaked great havoc in the Heavenly Palace angering the Jade Emperor.
How dare you wicked monkey!
You violated the laws of Heaven, you shall be put to death!
Ha! To hell with you!
Hurry and catch him!
Nezha to the rescue!
Loose your arrows!
Down with you!
The Monkey King destroyed the Army of Heaven in a complete landslide.
But Buddha would not tolerate his contempt of the Imperial Court.
From that moment on, Sun Wukong was pinned under the great weight of Wu Xing Mountain.
Five hundred years have passed...
Don't worry, the Great Sage Equal to Heaven will never die.
He's just...sleeping.
It's getting dark, everyone must hurry on!
OK, we know!
Good!
Those in the back keep up!
Be careful!
It's OK.
Be careful.
Monsters are coming!
Monsters!
Down the mountain now!
What was that?
A baby!
Poor child.
Where'd you come from?
How sad...
Merciful Buddha...

Bravo!
Wonderful!
The Great Sage Sun Wukong!
He fought against the Heavenly King!
Bravo!
But Sun Wukong will never die!
Jiang Liuer!
You again?!
Fa Ming?!
Look after your disciple!
Don't let me see you again!
Sun Wukong is here!
"You useless god, report your name!"
"Jade Emperor, you old man! Eat my stick!"
Master!
Liuer, what are you doing here?
I'm...
...begging for alms!
Merciful Buddha...
Liuer...
I hope you can stop fooling around and get your act together.
Master can't take care of you forever.
Master!
Is being a Monk really just about filling our stomachs everyday?
Then how are we so different from everyone else?
Of course we are different.
Begging for alms is just the starting point in becoming a great monk.
"Meditate, recite scripture, seek the truth..."
"To be carefree and content one must be neither conceited nor rash."
Look at me, your Master is looking pretty content and carefree, isn't he?
Monsters are everywhere.
Reciting scripture is not gonna scare them away.
Then what do you have in mind?
I wanna...
...learn Kung Fu and fight the monsters.
Shut up!
Jiang Liuer, you listen to me carefully.
We monks must deliver all creatures from torment...
We must start from the small things...
Meditate, read scripture, beg for alms...
See the world in a grain of sand, see Heaven in a wild flower...
Only then we can understand, see, believe....
Everything is an illusion.
Fate is in your hand, the appearance of the world is in your mind.
Superficial thought drives wisdom away.
Stop thinking about fighting and killing!
You should be...
I know. Reciting scriptures, seeking the truth...
Wrong!
Begging for alms!
Yes, Master.
Monsters are coming!
Arrows!
Let's go!
Liuer!
Liuer?
Jiang Liuer?!
One...two...four...
It's 48 in total!
This one is too old, it's no good!
But boss, we're still short one baby girl...
I got one!
I got a baby girl here!
Liuer, what do you think you're doing?
This fight isn't for little kids...
Get out of here, Master!
What's going on?
- Come on, Master! - Liuer!
Oh no! We're in trouble!
Master, this way!
Master!
Liuer, run!
Run!
Where's the kid?
Got her!
You idiot!
Liuer, where are you?
Liuer!
Run!
Where'd that wild monkey come from?
What are you waiting for?
Get him!
Horsey!
Buddha, you old bastard!
You trapped me for 500 years.
Wasn't that enough?!
Don't forget.
I am the Great Sage Equal to Heaven!
Don't forget.
I am the Great Sage Equal to Heaven!
The Great Sage?
Who's there?
Show yourself!
Now!
You again?! 
Are you really the Great Sage Equal to Heaven?
Yeah, so?
He...
He's really the Monkey King!
Don't follow me!
Stupid kid!
Great...Great Sage!
He went that way.
Thank you God of the Land!
Great Sage!
Wait for me!
Great Sage, what are you doing here?
Nothing, nothing at all.
Great Sage, I just saw you talking to Buddha.
Then you must've met...
Catch me now, you stupid kid!
Great Sage!
You must've met Buddha!
Do you think he can hear me when I'm reciting scripture?
Yes, yes. I'm sure he can.
The old man loves to poke his nose in everyone's business.
Great Sage, you must know a lot of magic!
I know!
Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equal to Heaven!
He has a steel-hard body and fiery golden eyes!
He is immortal and has mastered the 72 transformations!
He can ride on his cloud and somersault 108 thousand miles!
Let me pluck out a hair and blow it!
Nothing happened??
Oh right, Great Sage!
You also have a golden cudgel.
It is said your golden cudgel weighs thousands of pounds!
Great Sage, where's your golden cudgel?
In the puppet show, it was hidden in your ear.
Let me see!
Let me see!
You stupid little kid!
Chattering on and on, you're gonna make my brain explode!
Can't you just leave me in peace?!
OK.
Nothing more about the golden cudgel!
Great Sage, does the Three-Eyed God really have three eyes?
So cool!
Great Sage, is the River God as strong as they say?
Yes...
Are the Four Heavenly Kings really brothers?
No, they're sisters!
Then is Nezha a boy?
She's a girl.
Does the Pagoda Bearing God have a pagoda?
No!
- Then are there people in the pagoda? - Jeez, no!
You've got some guts Sun Wukong!
I am the Mountain God ordered by Buddha to keep watch over you!
How dare you leave without my permission!
I was wondering who that was, you useless god!
Well now that you see Sun Wukong is here,
why don't you just go and get lost?!
Sun Wukong, the power of the talisman still holds you.
Now you're nothing but a normal, stinky monkey!
What do you have left to brag about?
With just one punch, I can send you back to...
Stop you evil monkey!
"Om Mani Padme Hum" [Buddhist Mantra]
The talisman!
Where do you think you're going?!
Don't move.
Great Sage, look!
Seems like whatever was in Wu Xing Mountain wasn't something to mess with!
Could it truly be that was the Monkey King?
My lord...
You mean to say that hairy faced monkey was Sun Wukong?
Let's see how many tricks he still has up his sleeve.
Great Sage?
You're here too?
I thought I'd never see you again.
Let's see, I put you on the side of the mountain...
Then I remember falling off the cliff...
Then a big, weird-looking fish wanted to eat us...
Oh, I know!
It was the Great Sage who saved us!
Great Sage!
Thank you for saving us.
No! Master said monks can't eat meat!
You're a monk?
My name is Jiang Liuer, I'm a traveling monk.
My Master's name is Fa Ming, we live in Chang'an.
My...
Then what were you doing near Wu Xing Mountain?
It was those evil monsters, they steal little kids.
I accidentally ran into her.
And then, and then the monsters chased us.
So that's how we ended up here.
Stupid, evil monsters!
But everything is great now!
We're with the Great Sage!
There's nothing to be afraid of!
Did I ever promise I'd protect you?
After we get out of this mess, we'll both go our separate ways!
But Great Sage...
Careful, it's hot!
Great Sage?
It's OK, I'm OK.
What a silly little girl!
Great Sage, there's a temple here!
Great Sage!
Great Sage, Buddha came alive!
Buddha?
Om Mani Padme Hum!
Om Mani Padme Hum!
Om Mani Padme Hum!
Monster, put her down now!
This is Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equal to Heaven!
The Great Sage Equal to Heaven?
Look at that messy hair, how can he be the Great Sage Equal to Heaven?
If that's him, then I'm the Emperor of China!
He really thinks he's Sun Wukong!
Kid, come help hold this for your Emperor.
I'll let you watch me give this "Great Sage Equal to Heaven" a lesson.
Monkey King, eat this!
It's really him.
Stinky monkey!
It was you who threw me down from Heaven!
I've been starving every day for the last 500 years.
Look at how skinny I've become!
I won't let you get away with this!
Fine, you want revenge? Come and get it.
Stinky monkey, stop!
I'm coming after you, I said stop!
He's gone.
Your Emperor will spare you today, just don't let me ever see you again!
You're scared to follow him, right?
Nonsense, in this ancient forest?
He ran away so fast, how can I find him?
Seems like the Emperor of China isn't as awesome as the God of the Land.
What? God of the Land?!
I once led an army of 10,000 Heavenly soldiers.
I've mastered 36 transformations.
That smelly monkey hasn't taken a bath in 500 years!
I can find him just by his disgusting smell!
Kids, look carefully. Don't blink.
Watch me transform into the Heavenly Dog and catch him!
You call that...
It really is the Heavenly Dog!
Let's go and catch the Great Sage!
We're really going?
Didn't the Great Sage go that way?
Great Sage? He's over there!
Great Sage!
Wait up, Great Sage!
Great Sage!
The Emperor of China wants to challenge you to a fight.
Strange, he was just here!
Great Sage, you know eachother?
Is he really the Emperor of China?
I think he looks kinda like a...
A pig.
Actually he's a lot better looking now than he was before.
But his 36 transformations are pretty awesome!
36 transformations are nothing.
I've got 72.
Uncle Pig, there you are!
I thought you were too scared to come along.
Since you're so unwilling to let things go, let's fight!
Cool! You look just like me!
But your belly is bigger than mine.
Awesome! Do it again!
Great Sage, look!
Get out of the way!
Stay back!
Don't move!
Both of you, don't move!
Great Sage!
You...scared him away!
You could've gotten yourself killed, you know that?!
What were you doing provoking that dragon?!
It's all your fault!
You meddlesome pig, I should feed you to the dragon!
Fine, I can take that dragon!
Great Sage, please let him go.
It was my fault.
Too late!
Please don't!
Too late!
Please don't!
Why do you always speak up for him?
You're hurting his ear!
Great Sage, the dragon flew away!
Monkey, let me go or I'll kick your butt!
I'm getting angry!
Dragons really can fly!
Must be nice to be free like that.
It'd be great if I could fly...
So what if he can fly? I can fly too.
It'd be great if I could fly...
So what if he can fly? I can fly too.
Then I could fly over the mountains and find Master.
And take this silly little girl home.
The day you are strong enough...
And brave enough...
That day you can master anything.
Great Sage, you really mean that?!
Great Sage, wait up!
You went to the palace of the Dragon King, right? Was he huge?
Yeah, but he was really stingy.
Oh right, Great Sage?
Are there lots of dragons in the world?
- Wait for me! - Lots, anywhere there's water.
Looks like there's a house up there!
Maybe they have food!
Little Master, wait for me!
Great Sage, come on!
Great Sage, hurry up!
Wait here, don't move!
Welcome to...
Sorry to disturb you, is anyone home?
Anyone here?!
Where is everybody?
I'm...
Someone here?
Mister, we are travelers.
Can we stay here for the night?
What? You wanna...what?
I'm afraid I've been a poor host!
Don't mind him.
He's about as dumb as a corn cob.
Young Master, where are you traveling to?
We are heading to Chang'an.
What a little cutie!
Go and get some tea already!
Chang'an, huh?
Young Master, you mustn't go to Chang'an.
I heard it's under attack by monsters.
Monsters! Monsters!
Monsters!
Monsters! Monsters!
Ma'am, don't be afraid.
They're good people.
That's a good person?
They just look a little weird. 
Hey, Young Master said you look weird!
Don't worry.
We just want to stay here one night and we'll be gone in the morning.
- Really? - Really!
Then...then follow me.
Thank you, Ma'am.
It's OK, it's OK...
Hairy monkey, why do you always act so crude?
We are greatly honored to have you as guests in our humble home.
A bed!
Please rest gentlemen, feel free to let me know if there's anything you need.
Still standing here like a lump of coal?! Get to work!
Can't this kid stop crying for a minute?
Silly little girl, don't cry. Go to sleep, ok?
Look, I still have the little Monkey King doll.
You want it?
He'll protect you.
With him, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Go to sleep.
Useless piece of trash!
It's too quiet here.
I'm so used to the sounds of the forest,
now I can't fall asleep without them.
You've only been in the forest a few days.
I'm the one who can't sleep here.
I guess so...
Great Sage, if i find Master and bring the little girl back home, then where will you go?
Mount Huaguo.
Mount Huaguo?!
I know! The puppet show says...
The puppet show says that Mount Huaguo is a beautiful place!
The whole mountain is covered with fruit trees, flowers and grass!
It's surrounded by hills and water and it's spring all year long!
Right, and it says that the peaches there are as big as a rice bowl!
You believe everything in from that puppet show?
Actually, they're as big as watermelon!
As big as a watermelon?!
How far away is Mount Huaguo from here?
Almost 108 thousand miles.
I'd have to walk a lifetime to get there.
But that's nothing for the Great Sage.
That's right! I could do one somersault and...
Great Sage...
Wait until I get the little girl home, I promise I'll recite scripture.
You said Buddha will hear me.
Then I can ask him to give you back your magic.
Stupid little kid...
Chattering on all day...
Buddha is gonna be annoyed and get angry by all your nonsense and he'll punish me even more. Then...
Maybe one day...
What are you doing here?
Why do you look so guilty?
Stealing food again, right?
Any activity upstairs?
Hey, what's this?
What the heck are you standing there like an idiot for?
Come with me!
You know...
I think it's so strange.
Is that monkey really so powerful?
Do we really need to go to these lengths?
Our Lord is being too cautious, don't you think?
I'm talking to you!
What if...
Why don't we just rush up there and capture him ourselves!
Where are you going?!
Wait!
I was just kidding.
Jeez, you're such a moron!
You know what the Lord will do if you mess up his plans?
I said "Wait!"
You stupid pig! How dare you fool me!
Help!
You really think you can out trick the Monkey King?
Careful!
Young Master, where do you think you're going?
Save the kid!
You bit my butt!
Run!
Go!
Let's go!
Where's Monkey?
Great Sage, this way!
Get on the boat!
Faster!
Hold her.
Great Sage!
Look, Great Sage!
Put...put her down!
Pfft...The Great Sage Equal to Heaven?
No more than a useless monkey.
Young Master, I'll have no more of your cheek.
Sun Wukong, I'm sure you never saw this day coming.
Great Sage!
We have to go save the little girl!
I can't help you.
But...Great Sage!
I told you, I can't help you!
I can't be responsible for that kid.
Calm down, Monkey.
Don't call me Monkey!
Shut your mouth, you stupid pig!
But...but you're the only one who can save her now.
I'll go save her!
Young Master, wait!
Monkey, Young Master is running away!
Monkey!
That wretched monkey.
Jeez...I'm dying here!
Faster, or we'll miss the Lord's sacrificial offering.
Great Sage, let's go save the little girl! Quick!
I...
I can't help you.
I can't help!
Great Sage!
Great Sage!
Look, I still have the Monkey King doll!
Want it?
There's nothing to be afraid of with him to protect you.
Monkey?
Monkey?
Are you still alive?
Say something!
I know you're feeling upset.
But...
Don't forget.
You're the Great Sage Equal to Heaven.
Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equal to Heaven!
He has a steel-hard body and fiery golden eyes!
He is immortal and has mastered the 72 transformations!
He can ride on his cloud and somersault 108 thousand miles!
Pig!
Follow me!
Oh, there are temples on Wu Xing Mountain...
Along the riverbanks and on the eaves of rooftops...
We use the essence of boys and girls...
Risking our lives to seek the elixir of immortality!
Eeenie meaney miny moe...
...and you are I-T it!
Young Master, it's fate we meet again!
Not bad!
Here, this side now.
Liuer, are you OK?
Master, how'd you find me?!
Your Master went through hell and back again to find you.
Master, how'd you find me?!
Your Master went through hell and back again to find you.
I'm taking you back. You're never to misbehave again, you hear me?
I'll meditate, seek the truth, beg for alms...whatever you want!
Monks mustn't deceive Buddha or there will be punishment.
This is our punishment!
Master, look!
So many children!
Why are you just standing there like idiots?
Master!
You're safe!
My Lord, you're running out of time!
Sun Wukong, you spoil my plans time and again!
Liuer!
Where is that coward Sun Wukong?
He is not a coward!
Spit it out!
Where is he?!
Great Sage! He's here!
It really is the Great Sage Equal to Heaven!
You wretched monkey!
Monsters!
Sun Wukong is here, you'd better run...
The Emperor of China is here!
Monsters, you're in for a lot of trouble now!
Pig, be careful!
He can't withstand a single blow!
Leave the children alone!!
Great Sage!
Sun Wukong...
How's this taste compared to your peach of immortality?
I said...
leave...them...alone!
Great Sage!
Let go of me !
Great Sage!
I'm fine.
Just let me rest a while, then we can leave together.
Catch! Don't lose it again.
Run!
Quickly!
Master, I'm going to help the Great Sage!
Liuer!
Be careful.
I will be!
Great Sage, what can I do to help you?
What are you doing? Why are you back here?
Run away! Go!
But you promised that we'd leave together.
Stupid kid, you've forgotten.
I am the Great Sage Equal To Heaven.
I can't die.
Great Sage!
Great Sage!
Jiang Liuer, what are you doing?
- Jiang Liuer! - Eat my stick!
No!
Hey, you big fat bug!
I'm right here! Come and get me!
Jiang Liuer!
Jiang Liuer!
You stupid kid!
Jiang Liuer!
Great Sage!
Jiang Liuer...
Jiang Liuer!
Great Sage!
Great Sage!
