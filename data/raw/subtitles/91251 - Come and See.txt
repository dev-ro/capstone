Are you crazy? What the hell?
What the hell are you doing?
You playing games?
Who are you playing with?
With whom? You're digging?
You're digging again!
All right, go on digging, you bastards!
You fucking bastards!
So you are hiding?
But you can't hide any more!
They'll find you even underground.
They'll getyou!
Come out! Do as I tell you!
Come on, get out!
It's you I'm talking to!
Do this, do that!
Wipe your ass with your fingers!
Ordering me around like
another Flemish idiot!
That's what I used to be,
now I'm a German idiot!
We'll see about this.
You won't obey your uncle,
you'll obey a strong stick!
Get up!
They're hiding,
shitting cans!
The pioneers of hiding!
You're only good for one thing:
milking goats or slopping pigs!
You laughing?
You won't laugh for long.
Enough!
The good times are over.
You'll learn your lesson!
What are you sitting here for?
Get to work, or I'll fuck your mother!
Byelorussia, 1943
Go on, dig! Without any guns,
they won't let us join.
Nothing around here.
And where have I got mine?
I didn't buy it in a store.
It's not for me you're digging.
I'm ready to go!
Hello? Is this Berlin?
So, you did it? Your pants are full,
right?
What did I tell you?

Oh, son...
Oh, son...
How will you explain it to your
dad when he returns?
He will come back
and find nobody here.
Have pity on yourself.
If you can't have any pity for me,
then have pity for them.
For the love of God...
Have you no heart?
Stop talking like that, mom.
They're all going, I can't stay here.
What are you doing?
Then kill all of us, right now.
Why wait?
Go on, kill them!
Kill all of us!
You're not going anywhere!
You're not going!
Mother!
Hello there.
Or should I say good morning?
Right. Your weapon, where is it?
- Where's your weapon?
- It's right here.
And who are these two?
Twins?
That's right, twins.
Out of the same litter.
The sun's nearly up.
Shall we go?
Notyet.
When they put the cows out.
We want a crowd to watch.
Take these, son.
They will make you warm.
With us, he'll stay warm.
Don't you worry,
we'll look after him.
It'll be like a scout camp.
Buttermilk... Take what you like.
Got something stronger?
Milk with a little kick?
If I'd known you wanted to drink...
We never do.
Only on holidays.
And at funerals.
We maintain discipline. Our commander
is a career officer.
Kossatch! That's the man, alright.
You come too close, he'll make you go
away. You go away, he'll get you.
- Remember Bobok?
- What Bobok?
The one who was half deaf.
He wanted to sleep on guard duty.
Kossatch didn't bother to wake him up.
Enough of that!
Whether he woke up or not, it doesn't matter.
Makes you laugh, eh?
Women here like to sleep late.
Why are you standing? Sit down!
We don't have time to sit here.
If they catch us, that'll be the end.
One day I was sitting so comfortably
that now I never sit down.
Know what I mean, mother?
A shrapnel, as big as a fist!
You may laugh,
but it was right here.
What's the matter with those cows?
A couple of rounds in the air
would wake them.
Women! Get'em out!
Alright, let's go!
Why are you taking him away?
Get a good breath of air.
Milked or not, get'em out!
Where are you taking him?
He's a good boy,
he has never hurt anyone!
He's always polite!
Good people! Who could throw
a stone at such a boy?!
- What are you doing?
- Keep your hands off!
Come, say goodbye to your brother.
Here, hold the bird.
And don't move!
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Look.
It's Yustin, mayor of the village.
Idiot!
I don't understand.
My little Fliora! My son!
My son!
Hello, everybody!
Hello.
Just keep going, lad, keep going.
Why rip it off with the skin?
What are you doing?
I'm still alive!
Nurse, water...
Hello.
Go on, move!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Who is the last one?
Don't sit in the Major's chair!
All of you, shut up!
Close up a little!
And you, look forward!
What's that? You call it your face?
Look at your comrade's face!
Ah, what a suit!
Over here.
You lie down right here.
Like that.
Don't take your suit off yet.
Hey, you cow!
WE'D RATHER EAT YOU
THAN LET THE ENEMY GET YOU
Make room for the cow!
Hurry up, Perekhod! We ain't got
all day!
I've got only one sheet of film.
This is the last one, so hold it.
Our father is here!
Quiet down! I'm ready.
Look at this man. He put on
a new suit and he stays still.
Let's make a trade.
I took it from a live guy.
Ah, our Chief. Welcome, Comrade.
Will you give us a picture?
Rise up, our country wide and great,
Rise up for a deadly fight
With fascists daring to invade,
With black hordes of the night.
Let our noble wrath swell on,
Like a big and surging wave.
The people's war is going on,
Our sacred war of faith.
Who is there?
Password.
Password!
- Are you new?
- Yeah.
- Your name?
- Gaishoun. Third squad.
- Why didn't you shoot?
- I recognized you, Comrade Commander.
Whenever a man doesn't stop or say
the password, shoot!
Yes, only...
No excuses.
Extra duty as a punishment.
Thanks.
- Where is he?
- Who? Password!
- Where'd he go?
- Password, I said!
That damned owl again!
Go to sleep. Your watch is up.
...in the immediate proximity
of the enemy...
are fulfilling their duty day and
night...
And today I got two notes,
Very cryptically drawn.
Every line contained just dots,
For me to guess it on my own.
How am I to find
What is on his mind...
Ivan, come here!
I'm going to tell you the truth.
This will be a hard time for us.
Old partisans know only too well
what a siege means.
It means Hitler's "all-out war".
His objective is to exterminate
all of us.
Our duty is to defend to the end
every last bit of ground
that the High Command
has put into our hands.
But the situation is complicated,
and it's going to change every
moment.
So we must be vigilant.
You have a weapon in your hands
and a head on your shoulders.
Or, as our Commander says,
to live and never say "What the heck"
is not my way.
I've said it before, I'll say it
again:
A partisan never asks how many
fascists are there?
No. He asks, "Where are the fascists?"
Well, right now, they are here,
on our soil.
Every one of you
helps decide
how long this war will last.
We won't have any cowards here.
Not one of you is going to be
a coward.
Their main weapon is fear.
They want to make slaves of you,
just insects, to crush you down.
They're the ones who are going
to be scared of us! No mercy to them!
They don't deserve any.
We'll all be asked one day
what we did here.
Any wounded or sick?
Any who can't march alone?
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
We have to organize a reserve
station in any case.
- No wounded or sick!
- No one playing tricks!
You see, my boots are no good at all.
Swap boots with the new one.
He's staying behind.
All sections, by fours, fall in
and follow me, forward march!
Move it! Move it!
You heard the commander?
Come on, sit down.
Let's go, men!
Don't fall behind!
What's your name?
Fliora.
And your first name?
That's it, Fliora. Florian.
And yours?
Rose. Rose of the kolkhoze!
Ever hear that one?
Tell me, how did you get here?
They deported me to Germany.
But here I am!
They rescued you? Kossatch did?
I want to ask you, Rose, you were
all dressed up over there. Why?
Where was that?
This morning, in front of the men.
I couldn't get it, Rose, really.
My name is Glasha. Glafira.
You understand now, idiot?
- What's wrong?
- And what's wrong with you? Fliora!
Just exactly what are you doing
here?
What, they took pity on the little
one, leaving you here?
Kossatch took pity on you?
Pity?
Yes, pity!
They'll be lucky if I take pity
on them!
He can pity, yes, he can.
Only it makes him cry in his sleep.
Kossatch? Cries in his sleep?
He won't last long.
I'm telling you that.
You're lying! Filthy liar!
Liar!
Why don't you say something?
Why can't you see me?
I'm right here...
I exist...
Here I am.
You're not living.
You don't hear birds singing.
You're deaf and blind.
Here I am... here...
I want to love.
I want to have children...
Do you hear?
I can do anything for you, anything!
Do you want me to get blown up?
Don't do that.
You idiot! Idiot! Idiot!
I'm carrying 60 ammunition rounds,
a grenade, an automatic rifle.
I'm here to fight,
and you treat me like an imbecile.
Kossatch! I'm not Kossatch!
Are you crazy or what?
What are you doing?
What's got into you?
Fliora, Fliora,
little silly Fliora!
Did I shock you, boy?
Not again!
Don't be angry.
Are you starting again?
What's that?
It must be the beavers howling.
I guess, I broke their dam.
Everybody's howling today.
Look.
That's the one that's always flying.
- Want me to shoot it down?
- Hey, don't! Give it back!
One...
Two, three...
Glasha...
Glasha.
Come on, hurry! Hurry!
Glasha.
Tomorrow, Mum is going to be
very happy.
I'll hide all of us.
I know where.
You'll see my funny sisters.
Then we'll find Kossatch's
detachment.
Wait a minute.
Mum!
They're not here. It's alright.
Sit down.
They're gone.
Still warm. That's great.
Eat. Mum made it.
I know where they are. Let's go.
What an idiot!
Let's go!
That's where they all are.
Come on, let's go!
It's right down here. Let's run!
They're here!
They've gone to the island!
They're here!
Glasha!
They're back there, not here!
No, they're not here!
They're dead!
They were all killed!
All of them! Dead!
They're not! They're here!
Glasha!
His family have all been killed!
He's led me into the bogs!
He's deaf!
He's crazy!
He's gone mad! He can't hear!
He's taking me to the bogs!
His whole family have been killed!
Fliora, my dear child!
They killed your mother and sisters!
Didn't I tell you...
Didn't I tell you not to dig...
Dead to the last one...
To the very last one...
Poured gasoline over me...
I burned...
I ran... I caught up with them...
I begged them...
to kill me...
They just laughed...
Didn't I tell you not to dig?
Fliora!
Alright?
Why do you give him a nose?
He got syphilis.
- Yes, and only one arm.
- And no balls.
Yeah, his willy was already ripped off
in the last war.
If you capture him,
what would you do to him?
We once caught a horse thief.
And our men put him bare-ass
on an ant hill!
Even better, his bare ass on a red-hot
skillet that ain't been greased!
Ask the women
what to do with him.
Shall I stick the ears on?
Go ahead, let him hear all
we say about him.
You've got very soft hair.
Soft like a baby's hair.
Now he's ready.
Isn't that right?
Cover him with shit!
Where am I going to get it,
with everybody going hungry?
- At least rip out his tongue.
- Put warts on him!
I've made five of them already.
- Have you finished, guys?
- That's it. He's ready.
This one's not going to do any more
shouting! Let's go!
Bastard! Son of a bitch!
We'll bring it back. Don't worry.
When we come back, it'll be yours.
Why are you making a sick guy
of him? He's pretty strong.
You can go along, if you want.
To hunt, the wolf walks on his paws.
I know where there's a nice little
warehouse. Come on!
Dear sons,
you won't abandon us?
What do you think we are,
degenerates?
What do you want us to bring you?
Make an order just like at the canteen.
- Bread!
- Salt!
- Milk, please!
- Potatoes!
Get us some bread,
that'd be a hell of a good thing.
You never knew it would end up
like this. You couldn't know.
Fliora, look at me.
Go on, tell him that we'll be waiting.
No. It's all my fault.
