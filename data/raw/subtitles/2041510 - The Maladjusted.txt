- I don't know if you guys heard,
but Pete Harrison is getting married.
- Pete Harrison?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that guy
that does that song right?
- Yeah what song is that exactly?
- The, um, dun dun dun dun,
dun, dun, dun, dun dun dun
dun dun dun dun, dun?
- It's the guy we went to
high school with you fucknut.
- Oh yeah, that Pete Harrison, I know him,
Come on, Transition Hulk.
- Exactly.
- Wait what's Transition Hulk?
- Did you know Pete Harrison?
- Yeah kinda, I mean I
remember him a bit why?
- And do you remember the
Incredible Hulk TV show
from the 80s?
- Absolutely.
- Okay now remember when Bruce Banner
was about to change into the Hulk and then
showed him between stages
as he was transforming.
- Oh that is so mean.
- Who made that up?
- He did.
It's true, I mean ever since that bastard
hit puberty, he's had
weird in between stage.
- Yeah, I mean I've been
calling him that for so long,
honestly almost forgot his real name.
- Almost?
You thought he was a famous musician.
Hell you were singing
once of his greatest hits.
- Alright, let's do this.
- Ooh, yes please.
- Salud.
- Ugh, I can't understand how you guys
drink so much of this stuff.
- Practice.
- Shout it one for time.
- Maybe it's me, I just don't get it.
- What do you need help
understanding now buddy?
- Okay, how does a guy like Pete Harrison,
aka Transition Hulk, find love, real love?
- Robbie, you're so cynical, I mean,
just cuz he's not the most attractive guy,
he can't find love?
- Come on, we're talking
about Pete here okay,
it's not like the guy had
a great personality to
balance it out his ugliness,
the guy was a complete dick.
- That is one thing I remember about him.
- Yeah he smelled bad too.
- That's what I mean okay,
how does a guy like that
find real love?
- You know what, maybe he found
someone just as nasty and mean.
- No I'll tell ya what's happening, okay,
he's probably marrying the
first girlfriend he's every had,
probably the first girl he's ever boned
with that transition cock.
- Oh my god, maybe finding a girl
changed him and his personality blossomed.
- No, I ran into him
a couple of weeks ago,
he's the one that told
me he's getting married,
and he's still a prick.
- That makes me wonder
what her problem is,
what kind of pills she's on.
- It's different for women okay,
if she believes that she
can truly change him,
that's all she needs,
some women, just enjoy
having a project to work on.
- He's a fixer upper
alright, but you girls
are some fucked up creatures.
- Hey, Chelsea, hi.
- Hello.
- Hi, so I've left you like four messages
on your machine in about
the past three days and uh?
- How do you, I just haven't
checked my messages in awhile.
- Oh I mean it's okay,
just wanted to let ya know,
the ball's in your court.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- She's got the ball now.
- I think she does.
- Come one guys just give
him some credit for trying.
- Yeah, persistence, wear them down.
- I will, I'm going to wear her down.
Wear her down.
- Hey, to Transition Hulk.
- Alright, I'm gotta go.
- You can't leave yet, one more round.
Shannon, four Jager bombs.
- Just three Shannon.
I gotta go, it's my grandmother.
- What she's still alive?
- Whoa.
- Damn Robbie.
- What?
- Robbie, I swear to god, you need
to get outta your little funk.
- Oh my god, don't swear to god okay,
since when did you start believing in God?
- Redneck ex.
- It's because of that
redneck ex of yours isn't it?
- Okay, you're really
starting to piss me off.
And he wasn't a redneck,
he was a southern boy.
- That fed you roadkill.
- It wasn't roadkill.
We hit a deer on the side of the road,
and he brought it home.
- After he slit its throat?
- Yeah, after he slit its throat.
- Yeah and then he cooked it up in his
little redneck apron with
his redneck fine dining
and lobster bib, and you ate it.
- Just because it was killed on the road,
doesn't make it roadkill.
- Uh, yes it does, actually
that's exactly what it means,
that is the very definition of roadkill.
- He is a writer.
- Roadkill is mangled possum.
We ate venison.
- Sounds a lot more romantic.
- Oh, moist, mmm.
- Okay, you can pay for my drinks Robbie.
- Come on Nikki, I'm sorry.
- Moist you dick, I'll catch
up with you guys later.
- Alright, Chelsea.
- Here's the bad boys.
- I just wanted you to
know I'm probably gonna
leave you another message
tonight to just sort
of remind you that the
other messages were there.
- Uh Carl?
- Yeah right, sorry, you
know, your court, your court.
- Thank you, Chelsea.
Alright gentlemen.
- Salud yeah.
- Salud motherfucker.
Drop and pop.
Ah!
Let's get outta here man, come on.
- Hey you okay?
- This one
mile stretch of old town,
filled with bars,
restaurants and little shops,
this is where we've been
coming since high school.
It's where we've worked
and played for most
of our lives now.
Carl, the one that
showered you in his glory,
has been working at the same
place for most of those years
as a waiter and bar tender.
Ian there, well at one time or another,
Ian has probably worked at
every place along this stretch.
Sometimes he quits, cuz he
can't always get along with
the revolving door Managers
that go through here.
Or, he wants to nail some
hot young waitress that's
started working at another
place down the street.
So, he'll get hired
there for a little while,
do his deed, and then
quit, but most of the time
his problem is his inability
to keep his mouth shut.
- Liver and onions?
Our specialty, excellent
choice, and for you miss.
- I'll take a diet soda and
I'd love a tossed salad.
- I bet you would you little slut.
- What the hell?
You son of a bitch.
- Ugh!
- I could easily be described
as a human shadow or Carl's cool friend.
I work the same dead end
jobs, I live the same
going nowhere lifestyle
of bartending and drinking
all night and then
sleeping all my days away.
They are perfectly content with it.
Call me crazy but, I have dreams.
That's right, I'm a wannabe writer,
but don't all writers start off that way,
I hope so, I'm sick of just
existing, just getting by.
- Fuck this guy, I'm
not playing against him.
- How's the writing coming,
you making some progress?
- Yeah well actually I did pick up this.
- Carl, no more sugar packets,
you already threw up once.
Sorry man go ahead.
- Uh, I was just saying I
picked up this writing gig.
- Oh shit, a paying
writing job, that's great.
- Yeah sort of.
- Technical writing?
- It's 500 pages, the manual
needs to be no more than 50.
Can you handle that Robbie?
- What kind of an agent are you, Phil?
I mean what the hell makes you think I'm
a good technical writer?
- The email you sent me last month,
the one you know you
wanna hate fuck my mother.
- I don't really wanna
hate fuck your mother.
- Look, as disturbing and crude as it was,
it was very good, technically,
I like to keep copy of it right here to
sort of remind me of you know, what a
creative person you are,
it just inspires me.
As I slowly insert my
fist further and further
into the rectal cavity
of your now whimpering
provider of life, I rotated
counter clockwise, huh?
- Okay, Phil, I got it.
- I thought you might see it my way,
you'll take the job right?
I'll work on getting
you something creative.
- Greeting cards?
- Yes, greeting cards.
It's beautiful there's plenty of writers
who start off with
greeting cards and go into
Emmy award winning TV.
I mean from sitcoms to
reality TV, I mean it's all
starts in greeting cards.
- Fuck it, I'll do it,
but I want something
creative next time.
- Okay, there's a hard dead line on this
so let's not jerk them around okay?
- Fine but it's greeting cards next,
I want all the major holidays.
- Surely there's a stepfather's day,
that's gotta be like the bottom,
if we start there, you'll
sky rocket from there,
it's beautiful.
- Hey, did I miss anything?
- How's your grandma?
- Still alive.
I'll go wrangle in Carl.
- There ya go.
- Okay, alright, okay, okay, Carl.
- I'm good at it, I'm doing it.
- Let's just get down one step at a time.
- Okay.
I got beer on my hand.
- Oh my god.
- It's okay, hey it's okay.
- Where's you sugar packet?
- Oh no, not the sugar packet.
- Carl!
- Beer.
Okay.
- But still it's an actual
writing gig, that's cool.
- Yeah, I guess.
- And your book how's that coming?
- It's, I haven't written
a single thing in months.
- Really, why not?
- Lack of inspiration, writer's
block, procrastination.
Lack of sex probably.
- Maybe this job is just what you
need you get outta the rut.
- I was kinda hoping that same thing.
You know what, actually I
was thinking about talking
to Lester about getting
one of those beach houses.
- Yeah, nothing like
sunbathing bikini bodies
to get the creative juices flowing, huh?
- No, no, no nothing
like that, I just need
to shut myself off in a new
setting and just zone in man.
- You know, I like this beach house idea,
I think you need this,
dude, you need this.
- No, I don't need it
like you think I need it,
I just need to zone in and work.
- Can I take care of this for you?
- You, how?
- Yeah, Lester owes me.
- Lester owes you?
- Yeah.
- Ian, you gotta help me bro.
- I don't wanna ask for
details, I'll do it.
- Hey man, it's Lester.
- Go ahead, I guess.
- Uh, ha, that's right!
Whoa!
Hey, Transition Hulk!
Scared the shit outta me
man, I thought I was gonna
have a limb torn off or something.
- Ha, ha, ha, funny dick.
By the way, no one calls me that anymore.
- Really?
Why not?
I hear you're getting married
- Yeah.
- Cool, here's to that sir.
- Yeah.
- It's great.
- If it can happen for me
man, it can happen for you.
- I would sure as hell hope so.
Hey guys, look, it's Transition Hulk,
but nobody calls him that anymore.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
I mean, what are they thinking?
What else can we call you?
I mean you matured really well.
- Yeah thanks dick.
- Okay, have a good wedding.
- Your Mother's a dragon.
- Nikki has been
with us from the start,
innocent looking, yes, but
I think all the testosterone
over the years has affected
her, when an ex boyfriend
had the balls to show up at
Nikki's favorite hang out
with his new girl, Nikki
didn't take it so well.
♫ So unfair, I should
explain these things I do
- It's Lester.
- What you're doing this now?
- Yeah, Lester's working tonight.
If we're gonna do this thing
let's go ahead and do it.
- Alright.
- I'll get some goodies.
- Yeah?
About time motherfucker.
- One hour.
- Yes please.
- You tell him I said to
pay for it and get out.
Hey!
Pay for it and get out.
- Oh my gosh.
- How the hell do you imagine
it's gonna turn out, I mean,
why the hell would a group
of girls you just met
stay with you three clowns?
- Look, I'll handle the
details, just let me know when,
that's all you gotta do.
- And you're gonna cover the rent for all?
You think it's gonna work, I mean,
I'll put a call in tomorrow.
- Thank you, sir, one more thing.
- What's that?
- Hook me up with a couple of those J's
I know you got stashed
back in your office.
- Yeah, yeah, head on back,
you know where I keep the shit.
- Alright buddy, thanks.
- Mmm, this some good food right here.
- No it happened, it absolutely happened,
I was there and that's what I saw.
- Ahhh!
Here he is.
Here he is, you got?
- Oh, I got.
- Nice.
- Lighter?
- This spot always reminds
me of Melanie, has anybody
heard from her?
- I actually went to
see her the other day.
- I need to go see her, how's she look?
Any word on when she'll be released?
- It could be awhile.
- How is she?
- So so, she was definitely fully doped up
on whatever the hell they had her on.
But she looked good.
- Oh man, she always looks good.
- Smoking hottie.
- You horny assholes.
- Hey easy there, charm buck, that's not
what I meant at all.
- That's what I meant.
- Fine, Robbie, I take it back,
you two cunts are pricks.
- Oh wait second how does us commenting
on her sexiness affect anything or anyone?
- Yeah, I mean, I think it's the kinda
thing she'd like to hear
right about now ya know?
Might perk her up.
- She tried to kill herself you morons,
it's not like she got
stood up on prom night
and needs to be perked up.
- Blah, blah, blah, blah.
- Why do I hang out with you?
- Okay, on a lighter
note, beach trip soon yes?
- Oh yes.
- Robbie?
- I can't make it.
- Good, cuz you're not invited.
This is a full out guyfest.
- I hate you, more and more with
every single passing
day, just so you know.
- I wouldn't admit
it, but Nikki was right,
I couldn't help but think about
taking advantage of Melanie
while she was all doped up.
She looked so hot and vulnerable.
♫ What's wrong with my smile
♫ Can you tell it ain't me
- Yes my man is ready to go.
Hey Robbie if this
writing things takes off
you can dig up the rest of your house.
- Hey, no more knocking
my house, I get enough
heat from my goddamn super
successful neighbors.
- What's that?
- Pleasure reading.
- Relax you'll nail it,
you work and we'll play.
- How's that for support?
♫ She got everything that you want
♫ She got sugar and she got salt
♫ She got her left foot in
but her right foot's out
♫ She'll take it with or
she'll take it without
♫ She ain't got no eyes
in the back of her head
♫ Try to beat you with the
♫ Boy instead
♫ What she wants to say
fellas she ain't never said it
♫ Come on, salt water jacket
♫ She got lips like mama oh yeah
Nice one?
- Yeah man.
- Oh man, I really hope
one of these houses is full
of some hotties.
- Now what'd you have in
mind for the hotties Carl?
- Okay, you know what, whatever,
I'm set either way, okay?
I've already booked two dates online
with some local lonely chicks.
- Dude, that is so sad.
- You know what, I disagree alright.
Nine times out of 10 these dates end
in some sort of sex.
- Yeah indeed, some form.
- Right.
- Like the chick with
the carrot stick fetish?
- It wasn't that bad.
- Wasn't that bad?
She made you eat it afterwards, Carl.
- Could have been worse.
- I gotta hear some stories
that are worse than carrot girl.
- Okay, I'm getting laid
this week either way,
can you say the same, either of you?
- I think I'll manage.
- Who the fuck are they?
- I don't know.
- Hi, I think you guys
have the wrong house.
- You're scheduled here this week.
- Please say yes, please
say yes, please say yes.
- Yeah, this week.
- But we can't both be booked here.
- Oh that would be so great.
- Uh, well.
- I know this is Lester's house
because I've stayed here before.
Who did you talk to?
- I talked to Lester, right Carrie?
- Yeah, I talked to Lester.
I did.
- Well, one of us has
either the wrong house,
or the wrong date.
- Yeah well fuck you, we
don't have the wrong dates,
we didn't come all the way out
here and get the dates wrong.
- Relax, we'll figure something out.
- Figure something out?
- You know there's nothing to figure out,
we're not here to become friends,
we're not gonna talk
about it, you know what,
we'll just call the realtor and then,
let them figure it out.
- The realtor.
- Yeah.
- I thought you said you
got the place from Lester?
You know, the owner of the
house, my personal friend.
- Huh, well obviously we're
fucked, whatever we'll
just call the agent we'll
get our deposit back
and we'll just go somewhere else.
- But what about your vacation?
I mean here me out, and
think about my offer.
- An offer, huh?
- Yeah, we've already paid for the place,
we're here, you guys are here,
we can all just stay here.
- I don't think that's gonna happen.
- But we don't all have to pay.
- Meaning, if the agent fucked up
and double booked it, you
guys will get your money back,
but you can still stay here,
there's plenty of room.
- Oh, so what do you get outta this deal?
- Well, I know Lester will be
furious about this fuck up,
and I also know that he'd be
very grateful if I handled
the situation and made
sure everybody was happy.
I mean hell, he'll probably
give me my money back.
- Aww.
- Lester's a stand up guy.
- I'm sure he is.
- Well fuck, my cocksucker
double booked it.
- I booked it I swear.
- He didn't
say you didn't, he said
it was double booked.
- How did this happen?
- You know Lester, I
mean look, it's Lester.
I mean this is so Lester.
- No, this is so fucked,
I didn't come here
for this, this is a complete distraction.
- Okay, on the record, I
think this is so awesome,
how are you not seeing this?
- Relax, we'll figure something out man,
you'll still get your stuff done.
- Whatever.
Okay, if you'll cover
the house, we'll stay.
- Deal.
- But it's not your house.
- It's not our house.
- We're not your guests,
it's our house, too.
- It's your house, too.
- And you have to play by
our rules or you leave.
- Your rules or we're gone.
- Not us, you.
- Not us, you.
- You fucking with me?
- Little bit.
- Three things we want,
privacy, respect, and privacy,
and the master bedroom.
- Deal, deal, deal.
Not sure what I can do about that.
Unless you want to join me.
- Hey no, dick, ugh.
- Is this gonna work?
- I don't know.
- Does he play by the rules?
- Not his strongest suit,
but I'll handle him.
- Hi, I would like to volunteer to help
you ladies unpack, not
like you know go through
your stuff just help you
carry it up the stairs there
so you know if you have
any luggage, I'm the guy.
Broad shoulders here
that's what's happening.
Alright, I'm Carl by the way,
and uh, hi, Carl, that's me.
- I'm Laura.
- I don't suppose either of you
ladies are fans of lighthouses?
- There's no fair way to decide.
- So what, that just means it's yours?
- Well my bag is here and I'm unpacking.
- You didn't even wanna stay here with us.
- You know, I don't think so, re-pack.
- Really?
- Really, what are you doing?
- Getting comfortable in my room.
- You're joking right?
- You're still staying?
Cuz naked time is all the
time in this room baby.
- Oh my god, we're leaving Kerry!
- Hey look, I'm making
a capital I for Ian.
Almost there, oh yeah, there it is, Ian!
- That is not a problem.
- I don't care how drunk
you get, who's getting sick
in the other bathroom,
how bad you've gotta go,
this bathroom is off limits.
- Understood.
- I hope so.
- Look, I didn't sign up for this,
you're welcome to use ours.
- Do you guys trust the guys here alone?
- Yeah, as much as I trust
being here with them.
Thanks.
- What do you guys thinks gonna happen?
They go through your underwear
drawer and sniff your panties
a little.
Who cares?
I would however hide your dildoes,
cuz they'll probably try
to fuck that weird one
with it.
- Oh my god, thank you so much
Fiona I feel so much better.
- So you hid yours, huh?
- Oh hell now, I want them to see
what they have to compete with.
However that Ian one, I don't
know, he uh, he looks like
he might be able to compete.
- You've been here 10 minutes
and you've seen someone's cock?
- She's amazing.
- Uh huh!
- She's my hero.
- Why do I bother?
- Hey, this is vacation, let us vacate.
- All the way around sweetie.
- Nikki says hi.
- I didn't get anything.
- Me neither.
- Umm, so explain this to
me please, the girls are at
the beach in their bikinis
and we're here drinking
like we're back home, why
are we here instead of there,
where there are bikini's
with chicks in them
and I wanna nail one of these
chicks, like any of them.
- We will.
One more and I'm done.
- And then we go?
And hang out with the
girls at the beach right?
- Look, you act desperate,
you get treated desperate.
Haven't you listened
to anything I've said,
what would be the obvious
thing any rock hard cock
would do to get these chicks?
- Uhh, talk to them, at least.
- But no one dying to sleep with them
is going to go to a bar and ignore them.
- Not at two in the afternoon, no I
absolutely agree with you there.
- Exactly, we're not desperate.
He let me ask you something.
- Me?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm not having sex with you.
- I can tell.
- Really?
- My crotch is dry.
- Okay, yeah go ahead.
- Are you more interested in the guy
who asks your name and tells you his,
or the guy who simply says,
this is what my life is babe,
this is how I have fun, and you could
have tons of fun with me.
- Which kind are you?
- Have I asked you your name?
- She's wearing a name tag.
It's above the left coconut.
- Thank you.
The point being, girls like a mystery,
if you're an open book,
you're not a mystery.
And only a mystery gets solved.
- That is true, most girls I know
would go for the mysterious type.
- Exactly.
- So we act like we don't want them?
- Yup, you don't give them what they want,
you give them the opposite.
- Are girls really that dumb?
- This is fascinating, but
um, are you done with me?
- Yeah for now.
But don't go too far.
- Okay, but how can they
see us having our own fun,
if they're at the beach and we're here.
- They don't need to.
Okay, we could be anywhere right now,
having all sorts of fun, they don't know.
- Anything would be better
than telling them that
we're having shooters at high noon.
- But if we're water
skiing or jet boarding,
or water boarding, or being touched
by the gorgeous views of lighthouses,
whatever bullshit we say,
now we're not the guys
who are drooling after them.
- Okay, so we're going to
attract them by avoiding them?
- No, this is just phase
one man, and we're gonna
plow through these phases
a lot faster than normal,
I'm not fucking around,
but just know this,
if you're mouth is
watering she's staying dry.
So man up, and show them
that you don't give a fuck.
- I would love to, when?
- Right now, let's hit the
beach, walk by, say hi,
nothing more, the we walk away from them.
Okay, this is very important.
I'm getting laid either
way, okay, I'm trying
to help you partake as well.
You want the girl you'll
listen, say hi, walk away.
You got it Carl?
- This is good, I like,
just like eat it bitches.
- Yeah, exactly.
- Good, good plan, let's go.
- I'm gonna throw up first.
- Ladies.
- Is that a canoe, we
should rent some canoes.
- Would you girls like to get
dinner with us this evening?
We'd be honored you know,
our treat, of course.
Just might be nice to
get to know each other
a little bit better you know.
I mean we're gonna be living
together for like a week
and we don't know anything about you.
I mean, we don't know
you, you don't know us,
I mean you probably don't
even know our names.
- Carl, right?
- Yeah, actually, wow.
I mean we're probably
this big mystery to you
and I know you are to us, right?
I mean I'm intrigued
frankly, how about you guys?
I think we're all intrigued, right?
So, umm, I think you're mysterious, I do.
Like in a good way, not
like suspicious, or you're
you know, doing anything
criminal or illegal or
anything like that, nothing trashy.
Umm, everyone loves a
mystery, mystery is something
everyone wants to solve.
Little help guys.
- Yeah, we have plans, huge plans, big.
Tisk.
- Plans?
- Yeah.
- You have plans,
they have plans, it's okay,
we have plans too, so.
So it's yes.
- Maybe some other time.
- Definitely.
Like when do you think?
- That's the mystery.
- That's they mystery, absolutely,
that's they mystery guys, you know,
whenever we're gonna have dinner,
cuz that's what's gonna happen.
- Enjoy the surf guys, get that canoe.
- Thanks a lot guys,
you know, what's plan B?
- Why?
That went perfectly.
- Yeah that was fantastic.
- That went perfect, really?
Hold on.
- Fuck.
- Oh yeah!
- Whoo!
- She's going at it.
- You earn mother fucker!
- I like your
- You know what, none of these girls
are gonna get with him now, none of them,
he just lost them all,
they are off the table,
and our game now, that's what happening,
right now, that's what's happening.
Ian just removed himself
from the competition.
And you know what I'm gonna
do, this is what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna nail all three of
them, just to spite the guy.
That's what I'm gonna
do, they can hear him,
why do you think they're
not down here right now.
- And I can hear you too asshole.
- Damn it!
I think I hate them.
I really do, I just, ugh.
- Brutal man, here hit this.
- Brutal doesn't even begin
to describe this woman.
What do you think they're doing up there?
- I'm so ready to, holy shit,
you look so hot.
- Thanks.
- When that weird, awkward
one sees you, he's gonna die.
- I just hope I get some drinks
bought for me tonight you know?
- Could be totally dead.
- It won't be dead, the bartender told me
all the tourists come out tonight
and they're young and they're rich
and they buy drinks.
- And if not?
- Then I guess I'm gonna
have to make out with you
and charge commission.
- Ah!
- Hey do my hair, do my hair.
- Fine!
- What's happening?
- Back again, huh ladies?
- He's wearing no shirt.
- I know.
- Oh my goodness.
- Explain this to me again, the girls
just went to a nightclub to
get hit on by a bunch of guys
and we're just sitting
here, drinking, still.
- I appreciate your
resilience there buddy, but
I don't know maybe take the night off,
I think you've probably crashed
and burned enough for one day.
- Okay.
What the fuck dude?
At least I'm making an
effort, I mean what the hell
are you guys doing?
- Carl, you're trying too hard.
- Okay, you know what,
here's something I've
kind of started to notice.
- Okay, let's hear it.
- It seems to me you two motherfuckers,
you've just known me for so long now
and know me so well that you
can only see anything I do
towards a girl as lame, alright?
It's like I've been typecast
to just play a certain
role in life but only in the
eyes of you two cock suckers.
- Cocksuckers?
- Well I think I sort
of too dude.
- Shut your suck holes and let me finish.
Now if I even decide to,
I don't know, make a move
or strike up a conversation with a girl
not only do I have to worry
about the possible rejection
from that cunt, but then
I have to also worry
about you to mu-lak-as
busting on me afterwards.
- Hey nice use of the word mu-lak-a.
- Thank you, may I finish?
- Absolutely.
- Please do.
- Now if Ian decides to go up to a girl,
do his thing, yeah it usually works,
because he's confident, but he also knows
that if by chance this
girl should reject him,
we're all just gonna get together
and analyze the hell out of her, we're
gonna come to the
conclusion that there must
be something wrong with this girl
because she didn't fall for
his slobbering, drunken,
burping approach, he feels
safe, you know, either way.
Where as I, you greasy Greek
shit bag, have pressure from
both sides of the equation,
but fuck you both,
fuck you both and fuck those bitches,
cuz I can still get
mine, without any grief
from any of you.
- Carl, meeting desperate women online
is no way of getting yours.
- At best, it's the equivalent of fucking
a blow up doll.
- Yeah or like one of
those rubber latex dolls.
- Yeah, they're actually
kinda sexy you know.
- Yeah for the price they're
probably not that bad.
But dude, the women you're talking about
those are just desperate,
vindictive nymphos
that need to feel loved,
even if it's for one night.
- And there's no strategy
involved in that.
- Yeah, it's the easy way out.
- And you know, one of
these psycho chicks,
one of these days is
gonna cut your throat man,
I guarantee it, now you keep
casting your net out there,
you're gonna catch something
more than you bargained for.
- Yeah, like the clap man.
- Yeah, the clap, or an std cocktail,
a little gonorrhea on the
rocks with a herpes twist.
- You'd be mixing up some crap salad.
And dude do you remember
from a few months ago,
that girl he was sleeping with.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah.
- I can't believe I'm doing
this on my wedding night.
- Man that is so twisted.
- Yeah like that Karen girl twisted.
- Whatever, look, check out what my net
brought in now.
- Now she's hot.
- Whoa, she is hot.
I don't what the girl you'll
be meeting looks like,
but she's hot.
- Whatever.
Remember to rehydrate between
blowing each other fags.
- Uh, Nikki says hi.
- Oh man.
You got anything?
- Nope, nothing, I
wonder what that's about.
- That's weird, she always texts me.
- No, seriously though, one drink
and we're done here.
- You're not
having an amazing time?
- Oh my god, check it out.
I think he's on the prowl.
- What's with the balls,
why do guys feel the need
to announce that their
balls have also arrived.
- I feel like a guy adjusting
his balls is like the visual
equivalent of a pickup line
- Yeah it's sexy.
- Yeah, women love it.
- Especially when sloppy
Joes like that do it.
- Oh gross.
- Sup ladies, buy you a drink,
while I rub on my balls?
- Oh my god that's so gross.
- You see that?
- I think it's a tranny.
- What the hell's a tranny?
- Hey, uh, beer and a shot
please, I've got card.
Monies on that card, you
don't have a shirt on.
- What's he doing here all alone?
- God, if he comes over
here do I have permission
to give him a wedgie or something?
- Yeah totally, if you want
him to think you're flirting.
- Carl.
- Hey, that's me baby.
- Umm, you're not quite what I expected.
- I sent you a picture.
- Not of yourself.
- A good likeness.
- Hugh Jackman, really
- Uh, yeah, I'm sorry, you're not
exactly this either ya know.
This you?
- That is me, and a better likeness.
- Well.
- Yeah.
- So uh, you down to fuck?
- I'm going home, thanks.
- I mean we could just spoon, oh whatever.
Fuck me, this never
happens when Hugh Jackman
uses my picture.
Oh that was a bad idea.
- Did he just throw up?
- Oh my god that is so sad.
- I have never seen a crash
and burn quite like that.
- He's definitely not scoring
any points for originality.
- True, but if you're
gonna crash and burn,
crash baby and burn.
- God.
- Umm, what are you doing?
- Call it charity.
- No, we're calling this vacation.
- Oh no she's not.
- Hey funny seeing you here.
- Hi ladies.
Here to join me?
- We should probably bring you home.
- Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah, not what you're thinking stud.
- You wanna eat my liver don't you?
- Listen you drunk fucker.
- Uh Carl, be nice.
- Fine.
- I hate them.
- See that, I see a little hole.
- Oh man, this is the best.
- There she goes.
So much love to give.
- What's up fellas?
- That was quick, glad
you made it back alive.
- Oh that was magical Carl.
- Oh yeah, I'd ask you to
spend the night with me,
but you wore me out.
- What the fuck are you guys watching?
You sick bastards.
- Sympathy, I think.
- Necromancer.
- What have you seen this?
- Yeah, actually I like the
second one better though.
- That is so strange.
- Yeah well I have a
DVD player in my room,
McConaughey movie, let's go.
- No, no, no I'm sorry,
that is disturbing.
- Eh yeah.
- See you guys later.
- Sweet dreams, Carl.
- Yeah, yeah, late night Carl.
- Get the fuck outta here, I'm
not buying that shit at all.
- I gotta get to work.
I'm never gonna finish this stuff.
- Later man.
- Later.
- Look, that's gonna be you one day man.
- Which one?
- Right there man.
- Oh, I was hoping for the other one.

changes I want to make,
the changes I shoulda
already made, hell, I've
already lied to you,
about visiting Melanie,
all the girl needed
was someone to listen
to her, and I couldn't
keep my head outta the gutter.
- Take me Robbie.
- Jesus, you see what I mean?
I couldn't just sit there and provide
some sort of comfort for this long time
friend without wishing I
could cure her with my cock.
I actually found he situation
somewhat arousing and
it sickens me, a little.
- Oh yes, Robbie, thank you, thank you,
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, thank you Robbie.
- You're a good man, Robbie!
- Yes, yes, cure her, bring her back,
heal the shit out of her, boy!
- Thank you Robbie!
- I feel as though I've hit
some sort of a bottom.
Do I no longer have any
compassion, did I ever?
Something has to change.
I have to change.
- Ugh, I don't know, porn stars for GPS.
- Nikki says hi by the way.
That's a great idea alright,
I mean, think about it.
Turn right, just up ahead,

Yeah, we'll be hanging out all week.
Freshman kids, don't know

Party with the seagulls and the dolphins?

And BYOB.
♫ Sold my soul
- Think she's even in to you?
- Oy, sweetheart!
That is good beer!
- What's the legal age
in this state anyway?
- I don't think it's done by age anymore,
pretty sure it's determined by cup size.
- Oh yeah, where'd you hear that?
- I don't know I just heard it somewhere.
- So by law, if a girl's breasts are
of a certain size, she's legit?
- No, I think it's the younger you are,
the bigger the cup size
has to be, ya know?
- Uh huh.
- You're.
- Not because of me.
- Yes, we're here because of you,
because you have a crazy, psycho, stalker,
ex boyfriend, came to her house everyday,
sent weird gifts, like.
- It wasn't that bad, you know it was.
- It was super bad, he called our house,
like went to her mom's
and just freaky, stalker.
Actually finally broke up with him.
- Congratulations.
- You know what, I think
we've all been there, right?
I mean a little bit, some,
I mean it's safe to say
we've all done that, ya know?
Well no, I mean like not
me, I wouldn't do that,
you know, it's just there
are guys who do that.
I've heard of them, they're
strange, they're strange guys,
and they do that, I mean.
- What are you talking about?
- I would never call you Kerry?
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean
I would never call you,
I mean call you and hang
up on you, you know, like
be all stalkery, I would never do that,
that would be out of control,
I mean if I were obsessed with
you I would probably just
like hide under your bed
listen to you breathe
while writing poetry.
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Yeah, I'll go cuz you're a maniac.
- Hey can you watch them
and make sure nobody
slips anything into our drinks?
- What they hell am I supposed to do now,
she figured out my strategy.
- It's the only way
you're getting any, pal.
- Good to know, hey ladies, let me know
if you need any help in there.
- It was totally gruesome.
- It was so gross when the director
says oh my gosh this is a love story.
- But he's right, I mean within
the reality of the movie.
- Yeah, yeah you writers?
- Yes, but it's true, I mean
if you take out the fact
that the love interest was a corpse.
- So within the reality of the movie?
Is that what you're saying?
- Yes, and just forget about the fact that
he committed while stabbing
himself in the stomach
while jerking off and
he orgasms at the end.
- Yeah a bloody orgasm
like how can there possibly
be a love story within that reality.
- And the blood is like
splattering all over the place
and on the fucking walls.
- I love it, it's so
gross it's so classic.
- So hot that you've seen this movie.
- You're gross.
- Will you play dead for me?
- I will eat your face.
- Oh yeah!
Yeah!
Now you know these are
an aphrodisiac right?
- Yes.
- Does that mean they're
going to put me to sleep?
- I'm surprised you know that word.
- I know, I read occasionally.
- Spell it.
- That is so gross, you guys are all, fat.
- Can you just try one before you judge?
You've swallowed way worse
and more mouths
- Let me buy you another drink.
- I think I'd prefer the oysters.
- Now, now come one, share some of
you sexploits with us, Kerry.
- Uh no, I think Fiona's the one
that you wanna ask about
that kind of thing.
- I know, I do have good stories, however
in high school, dear
Kerry that she should save
herself for marriage, however she did this
while still having sex
with her boyfriend, hmm?
- How can that be?
- How is it possible?
- I'm your first am I?
- You're not gonna be
anything buy my.
- Just tell it, it's
funny, they will love it.
- Come on, just tell the story.
- Someone's gotta tell the story.
- Someone tell it, come on.
- Back in high school, Kerry decides that
she can get out of the no
sex before marriage thing
by only doing anal with her boyfriend.
- In the ass.
- Technically I was right.
- You're very innovative,
probably for your time.
- I take back everything
I said about you my queen.
- Know it's really sex isn't it.
It's so hot and humorous.
She got a horrible case of hemorrhoids.
- Fiona!
- Hemorrhoids suck.
- Yeah.
- Anyway, so what?
- Okay, well if we're going there,
well then why don't you
tell yours queef queen?
So this one time.
- My pussy has amazing things to say.
- I can't take her to yoga class.
- A lot of air, she has a big vagina.
- So we have like
royalty at the table.
- A big vagina, fuck off, you're the
one with the quarterbacks and NFL.
- I like ventriloquism, so.
- Hi ladies and gentlemen.
Can I have you do me a favor,
pay your bill and leave, please.
- Why?
- I said so, the Good Star,
my restaurant, my rules.
- Ooh, tough guy.
- Do you guys get kicked
out of everywhere you go?
Just want to know what to expect.
No.
- Yup!
- Sometimes.
- See now this is nice.
- It is.
- I have a question for the guys.
- Fire away.
- Have any of you ever been
in a real long term relationship?
Don't worry Carl I don't know you.
- Wow, what the fuck, come on, I've been
nothing but nice to you this evening.
- Oh you have been, but Fiona just doesn't
want anyone to hurt her rep.
- As what?
An ice cold bitch?
No.
- Ah man, that was your moment there.
- Yeah you shoulda just
made something up man.
- Whatever Fiona, alright look,
a relationship doesn't
have to be long term
to be good.
- How so?
- Passion, alright.
Short and sweet.
No reason to drag it out to
the bitter resentful end.
- Well you know my
man's got a point there.
- Yeah he sure does.
- You don't look very
comfortable down here.
- Thank you, that's really
sweet, but I think we'd both fit.
- Sure, I like the sound of that.
- Tell us about passion.
- Well that seems like a pretty
broad topic don't ya think?
- Yeah would you mind
narrowing it down a little bit.
- Passion in a relationship,
tell me about a passionate
date or a passionate
first kiss with a girl.
- Or a guy.
- Ian what are
your thoughts on passion?
- Talk to me tomorrow,
I'll tell you all about it.
- I got one.
I got one.
High school, Halloween party, Stacy.
Robbie you remember Stacy?
- I think so.
- She was your girlfriend?
- Yeah, no, not really.
Her friends kind of dared
her to make out with me.
- How is that passionate?
- Okay, the thing is I didn't
know at the time, alright?
I didn't find out that they
dared her til like the day after.
- Oh how sad, that doesn't even count.
- Okay, look at this
from my perspective okay.
Here I am, I'm at this
party and all the sudden
the girl I had my eyes on
since like junior high,
just randomly approaches
me and starts kissing me,
like passionately, for at least minute,
maybe a minute and a half,
with tongue mind you, right?
- Uh huh, I think if your
memory about it is passionate
then that's what matters.
- Thank you Laura, absolutely.
- I think that's pathetic.
- Good one, too.
- Like what?
Did she have a short skirt?
- She did.
Actually it was very short and leggings
like garter leggins and decent sized.
- You like strawberries?
- I'm starting to.
- Do you like short cake?
- Oh, Carl!
- Kiss him, kiss him, kiss him.
Oh my god.
Oh my god, he's now.
- Well, good night Carl,
good night fuckers.
- What did she just do?
- Wow, that's some good fucking weed.
- I don't know if that was
like really fucking hot
or strange.
- Kinda both actually.
- I think I need a cigarette.
- Yeah, did that turn you on?
- Mm hmm.
- I'm gonna hit the hot tub, join me?
- Yeah, I'll be right there.
- Goodnight Carl.
- Good night.
- Hey grab some soy sauce, too.
- What the hell was that?
- She's just having a good
time, man, she's drunk.
- Do you think I got a shot?
- Well, I, honestly I, I don't know man.
- Okay.
Cool.
- Cool?
- Me?
- Yeah.
- I'm perfect.
- Good.
- Where you going?
- Hit the hot tub with Laura.
- Oh yeah!
- Word of advice.
- Yeah?
- Okay, cold less desperation.
- I wish you could get off on that.
- Think about it,
because if you need them,
then they'll know you're needy.
- If I need them, I'm needy.
- Yeah, if you need them,
you're needy, alright?
- Got it.
- Good.
- Totally, okay, have a good hot tub.
If you need them, you're needy.
If you like them, your
chances are unlikely.
Oh hey, Fiona, what's up?
Me?
Oh no, I'm sorry, I think
we had a miscommunication,
I mean I think you're pretty and all
but you kinda just do the ice,
cold bitch thing a little much.
What?
Yeah, yeah, I think you're pretty.
You know, you just don't always have to be
such a pain in the ass.
Well, I mean, yeah, you
know I condition and shit,
I put some lotion in there, some shampoo.
Get over here!
Oh!
- Oh!
I thought you might be a selfish one,
but you're oh so generous.
- Not only that but I'm happy
to put my penis in you as well.
- Oh!
- Stay there.
Alright, now is an
exercise in self control.
- Okay.
Ah!
That's really cold.
- Just wait.
- I didn't
realize you were so hungry.
- Oh I can always eat fish baby,
and I got a lot of fucking sushi to eat.
- Oh my god, oh!
Whoo!
Oh shit!
- Hey.
- Oh hi there.
- Finally get you to myself.
- Yes, I was thinking the same thing.
Whoops!
- Oh, oh so romantic.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
- Hey, hey, hey, Robbie, nice going bro!

- Yon, I haven't seen.
- Hasn't seen them.
- Yon?
- Yes, alright, I can see
that you, hm, are busy, huh?
Hey Robbie, you call me

- There's nothing to tell Yon.
- Hey are you

- God!
- God damn it, Yon!
- Alright, alright, I get it.
I get it, I will leave you two kids alone.

Eight or 8:30, eightish, okay.

- Shut up, Yon.
- Thought we had a deal.
- And you didn't bring any booze?
Hey come on bros, I thought

- Hey.
- You know what, alright, no problem.
This is Yon's party
huh, I got you covered.
- Thanks Yon, real sweet of you buddy.
- No problem guys I am glad you are here.
- So I thought you were having
a party here tonight, Mr. Big Time?
- Eh, you know, kids, they said eight,
maybe they meant 10, huh?
Hey, hey, hey kids, what's going on?
- Listen.
- Hey, what's wrong bro?
- In your face!
- Party in my face!
- Hey Yon!
- Hey bro!
- Missed ya dude.
- I missed you.
- Party in your face!
- Hey man, thanks for letting
me party in your face.
- Hey, that is what my face is here for.
Hey, party in my face.
♫ I got a crown on my head
♫ All day and night
♫ Cuz karma she don't like
me when I don't play nice
♫ I got bruises on my
feet from petty crimes
♫ I'll leave your ass so
fast don't think twice
♫
♫ I thought what you done is bad
♫ A train derailed from the track
♫ could it save
♫ I stayed inside the lines
♫ And had a heart attack but
I aint going back there again
♫ Oh oh oh
- That is not a band and
the music is just okay.
- What the hell is your idea of a band?
- Oh man, all the guys
you're talking about
they're a bunch of pussies.
Okay, my music has to be hard and the guys
playing they need to be
able to kick the living shit
out of me, I mean literally
like kick the living
shit out of me, like I should be afraid
to get into bar fight
with any of the members.
- You're funny dude.
♫ You threw a stone or two
well though I didn't break
♫ How many times you
kick what does it take
♫ To make me walk away from it all
♫ Oh oh oh
♫ I feel so outta control
- Alright, if you're such a
player, what are you doing,
sitting here talking to me?
- It's playa, not
player, get it right dog.
- I don't care about your
gansta lingo, tough bucket,
which one of these bitches is yours?
- Shit all of them are mine,
been with all of them at some point.
- Get the fuck outta here,
you are full of shit.
- He's calling you out dog.
- Yeah, he is calling you out.
- Ah, what?
What the fuck was that?
- That's a party in your face bro!
- I don't mind a party,
why's it gotta be in my face?
- I need many drinks
if we're staying here.
- They just
like to party, it's okay.
Hey, hello ladies.
- Good to see you.
- Football and basketball
and shuffle board, yeah.
- Shuffle board?
- Yeah, yeah, shuffle board.
- Ah, reliving the glory days?
- Oh yeah, I was just telling um?
- Susan.
- Susan about back in high school
when I played all those sports.
- I never heard of the last one.
When was this, like 20 years ago?
- Uh?
It was 12 years ago.
- She's gone.
- It's 12 years ago.
- I can't even talk to these young chicks.
Shuffleboard, I don't
even know what that is.
- It's that long slidey
thing at the pool hall
we used to play it all the time.
- Oh, well I actually like that game.
- Come on let's go do some
shots, forget about this one.
- I don't know, I think I'm
gonna call it a night, you know.
- Why you got something lined up?
- Well, kinda, I got a possibility.
- Alright, do your thing man.
- I'll see you later, Ian, I'm out.
♫ Me or myself, kiss and
tell, take the stairs
♫ my belly if
I'm around I will answer
♫ Love to let you in, pour some gin,
♫ Lay you back
♫ It took a little while to
realize that my sky was falling
- I get all kinds of
benefits from hanging out
with these kids, huh?
- They seem like good
kids, normal college kids.
Why would you take
advantage of them like that?
- Whoa.
Bro, I provide them with a service, huh?
They want alcohol and drugs
and I get it for them,
they want a safe place to
party and I provide it,
I take care of them.
- So what you do this for
a little coin and company?
I don't quite get it.
- A little coin?
My man, you've got the wrong
idea about Yon Zamolla.
These kids come from upper
middle class families and higher,
money means nothing to
them, cash and credit cards
flow freely and my
services do no come cheap.
- Come on let's hear it.
- What?
- What else?
- Well as you said, I do
occasionally get a little something
more than company.
- Yeah, and?
- And, these girls get
incredibly fucked up sometimes,
and sometimes they do some crazy shit.
- Well on of these days, the
father of one of these kids
is probably gonna catch wind of you
and bury you in a hole somewhere.
- Hmm?
Yeah.
But until then, I'm
going to keep my fingers
in their tight little asses.
Huh, huh?
And we need two good looking men.
- Good looking men!
- No, I don't mean, like find them.
- Boys!
- No, not our boys!
- Robbie, Ian!
Come over here!
- Ugh, new guys.
- What do we have here?
- That guy is like really super nuts.
- Yeah I kind of admire him,
I think he's an entrepreneur.
- Good, focus here, I
have rules to this, focus.
- You have rules?
- Shot, lemon, neck, salt, lick, drink.
- In that order?
- Just, come on.
Eww, fucking party in your own face, eww!
Give me my shot, dick!
- What the hell did you do man?
- I don't know but I
think I like her more now.
- I think you met your match Ian.
- I'll see you kids later.
- So you girls sure you're not gonna stay
and have one more drink
with Yon before you go, huh?
- No, I don't think so
- Kerry, can we leave?
- Here we go, a little game of eight ball
before you leave huh?
- I don't even know what that means.
- Kerry we're leaving.
- Come in.
- Hi.
I'm Carl.
- Shut the door.
- Okay.
- Take your clothes off.
- I can do that.
A nice place.
- Do you think I'm pretty.
- Um, yeah, I mean I can't
really see you very well
it's kinda dark in here.
- Come here put your
fingers through my hair.
- It's um, it's very soft, it's nice.
So uh, what do you wanna do now?
- Now I'm gonna
fuck you with my wiener.
- Wait what?
- I said.
- I'm gonna
fuck you with my wiener.
♫ Naught naughty naughty
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Get you little ass back here.
- Ah!
Ah!
Ugh.
♫ Naughty naught naughty
Ah.
- Wiener, wiener, wiener.
♫ Naughty naughty naughty
kiss my naughty naughty
♫ Ass
- Just tired of all the bullshit you know.
The partying and drinking all night
and working just enough
to go out the next day.
Just tiresome.
- Maybe you can look for a new job.
You're getting writing jobs now.
- I don't know, it's not so
easy to make a change like that.
- It's a start.
- I like you Laura.
- I like you too, Robbie.
Maybe we can hang out
when we get back home?
- I hope so.
- Don't eat it, carbs are the enemy.
- Hey Carl.
- Hey.
- God, Carl, what happened?
- It's not a big deal.
- It looks like a big deal
to me, you're bleeding.
- Ah.
- Oh my god, sit down.
- Okay.
- Oh my god, you're a mess,
you're really bleeding.
- I think I got jumped.
- You think you got jumped?
- Well.
- Oh my god, um.
- Carl, buddy, you're back.
- Oh, hey.
- Um.
- The fuck happened?
- A fucked up date.
- Some chick did this to you?
- Yeah, no, no, I don't
really know, actually.
- Robbie!
- Um I'll go get some ice.
- Robbie, come here!
- What's up?
Oh shit man, are you alright?
- It's just some cuts and bruises.
- What the fuck happened?
- Some freak beat the shit out of him.
- This is one of those
internet dates again?
- Let me see.
- You need to take us here now.
- Look, I don't even
know if the guy is there
anymore alright?
- We'll just go and we'll find out okay?
- That's nuts, what are you
going to do, go beat him up?
- No, I'm gonna buy him an ice cream cone.
- What is your problem?
We don't know the guy,
what if he has a gun?
- Ow.
- Look we're wasting time, let's go.
- Robbie you can't do
this, this is the opposite
of everything that you want right now.
- You don't understand, they're gonna go
with or without me, I'm not
gonna abandon my friends.
I have to go.
- Come one we're wasting time, let's go.
Let's go!
- So this is it.
- This is a very
nice place there Carl.
- Yeah well, like you guys said,
something like this was bound to happen
sooner or later.
Oh shit.
- That's the guy?
- That's the guy.
- You failed to mention this
guy's the top of the food chain, Carl.
- Alright so what's the plan?
- I got an ice scraper.
- Fuck it man, there's three of us,
hey we can handle the big boy.
Come on let's do it.
- Carl?
- Choke him out, changed
my mind, you choke him out.
- Back for more huh?
- Robbie, why?
- I can't even get my
hands up to his shoulders.
- Fight or flight.
Fight or flight.
- Sorry about your head.
- Ah!
- Ian, no!
- Guys, let's go.
- Jesus.
- Sorry.
Mur moor me moor.
- What the fuck was that man?
- What, what?
- What?
You went into psycho mode back there,
you woulda fucking
probably killed the guy.
- Oh what happened?
- He'll be fine, just
shut the fuck up, Robbie.
- Yeah, he'll be eating solid
food by the end of the week.
- How the fuck is that funny man?
In the least fucking possible
way, how is that funny?
- Because he got what
he deserved that's how.
- Overboard man, okay, you would've killed
the fucking guy if I wouldn't
have fucking stopped you.
- Okay, I get this,
gotta show off in front
of the little girlfriend.
- Look who's talking, you are
the fucking king of show off.
You knew god damn well I came here to work
and you turn it into one of
your god damn fucking parties.
- You know I don't know if
you've ever noticed Robbie,
while you got your nose
in the fucking note book
all the time, but you have absolutely
zero fucking fun in your life
if I didn't arrange for it.
- What do you mean by that,
arranging, arrange what?
Ian, you wanna tell everybody else?
- Yeah fine, this whole
thing, yeah, I fucking
arranged it fine, what's your
fucking problem with that
buddy, huh?
- You set this up?
Through your friend who owns the place?
- Lester!
Lester, that's right.
- Fuck you Ian, and I
still smell like fish.
- Yeah fuck you Ian.
- Ugh.
Thank you Ian, I don't know what everybody
else's problem is, oh shit,
new lighthouse documentary
is on again.
We can watch sports instead if you want.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, ah, this is all my fault, and I've
got the worst morning wood
that just won't go away.
- Holy shit, Carl, put that thing away.
- Fuck me.
- Ugh, oh!
- Sorry, dog, I didn't mean
to hit you with my dick.
- Put that fucking thing away.
- Christ, Robbie you alright man?
- Yeah.
- Guys!
There are not here for you.
Cops are across the street.
- Oh maybe, they have the wrong house.
- Maybe they're setting up for an ambush.
- Maybe if I start crying
I can get rid of this boner.
- You guys, I think they're here for Yon.
- What?
- Carl!
You're poking me!
Gross!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Eh, eh?
- You know guys I think it's safe to say
they're here for your buddy.
- Oh!
- He's doing the Zamolla.
- Oh!
- They tased him.
- Uggggh!
- Well, that's it, Yon just
got a party in his face.
- Oh good show.
- Did I start crying yet?
- Yes, and you still have a boner.
- Damn it!
- Oh my god, do you guys
see what's going on outside?
- Yeah.
- What's it all about?
- Okay, so apparently all
of those college kids,
are all actually really
still in high school.
- Oh!
- High school?
- Damn.
- Well, then.
- Dodged a bullet there.
- And detective Dan that Yon is wanted
for a whole nother list of charges
which include statutory rape.
- Damn.
- Delinquency of a minor,
I don't know what that
one is, drug trafficking,
sodomy.
- That's a good one,
I kinda like that one.
- I know Carl, I like that one
too, but it's still illegal.
- Anything else?
- Oh yes, and possession
of child pornography.
- Oh!
- Oh that's a big one.
- Uncle took pictures of
me and my cousin once.
- How do you make that go away.
- I'm sorry, I have a magazine
for these kinds of emergencies.
- Anyway, there were a few more charges,
but I can't remember all of them.
- Oh.
- Wow.
- Yeah, breakfast anyone?
- I really think we should hit the road.
- Dude, we're in the clear.
- I think we're done here.
- I think we all are.
- You're leaving too?
- I'm already packed.
- Spend a night at a nice hotel,
but I'm not spending
another night here, no way.
- This is bullshit.
Look if we leave now, like this,
we're all gonna remember
this as a shitty trip.
Stay, it's all passing then be cool.
- Hmm?
- It's the beach for god's sake.
- It might be cool, but I
think we're just done here.
- Hey guys, I just got
a message from Nikki,
her grandmother died, I think
she wants us to come home
as soon as we can.
- I think she wants
you to come back buddy.
- Really?
- I think that settles it, let's go.
- Really, fine, perfect end
right, like a bad massage.
- A bad massage.
- Yeah, one without a happy ending.
- That's a real massage you jerk off.
- Fiona please, can we
at least try and end this
as friends.
- Whatever, just as long as it ends.
- Group hug?
- No.
- I'm good.
- I'll give you a hug Carl.
- Thank you, Kerry.
- Part of me will always be inside you.
♫ I've known it from the
moment that I saw your face
♫ All the ink that lined the
page before has washed away
♫ All my selfish needs would cease to be
♫ When you looked at me
♫ Regrettably I fight the
urges that I had locked inside
♫ All caught up in tragedy
and how to nurse my pride
♫ I wish I could see these things you see
♫ When you looked at me
- Call me when you get home?
- Yeah, I don't know if
that's a great idea, Robbie.
- I thought you might say that.
- I just think you have some things to fix
and maybe some growing up to do.
- That saddens me, I'm
saddened, but it's good though.
As long as I don't end up
like that guy in the movie.
- What you mean the bloody
masturbatory suicide?
- Yeah.
- Yeah I don't recommend that.
- You're probably right,
I'll try and avoid it.
- Think you're gonna be fine, Robbie.
Just think you need to figure it out
what it is you want to accomplish
in this life, you know?
- I always wished that for me.
I had fun though.
- Yeah, I had fun too.
- Laura did
call me a few days later,
I went to visit her several
times and she came to visit
me some, but we eventually just faded out.
The car ride home was pretty quiet, except
for a lengthy explanation
to Carl that Nikki
was wanting more than just
a friendship from him.
- You mean like with benefits?
- I think he eventually got it.
It's hard to tell with that guy.
When we got home that afternoon, we drove
right to Nikki's house.
Ian and I left after a little while,
Carl never did.
A few years later and
Carl still hasn't left,
not that they didn't have their
share of issues to overcome.
- Talk dirty to me.
- What?
- Come on say something nasty.
- Uh.
- Come on.
- Okay, ooh, I got one, um,
I'm gonna fuck you so hard,
you're grandma's gonna
feel it, the dead one.
- Oh my god.
- What?
- That was terrible.
- No wait, hold on a second.
- I can't.
- You said she didn't even
leave you anything in the will.
- Stop.
- No.
- What?
- It was like.
- Oh my god.
- There was a love fuck for you.
- Just get it out of my head.
- It was a hate fuck for her,
but everybody gets.
- Stop, stop talking Carl.
- No, okay, she can't feel anything,
she's dead.
- Stop talking!
Stop!
- She had her
work cut out for her,
I guess she needed a project to work on.
I eventually finished the writing gig,
he needed me to write
in order to be my agent.
- That's two weeks late.
- So I wrote.
- Eeeh!
- But I never
wrote greeting cards.
It took awhile, but I finished the book,
it got a reasonable first print,
maybe it'll get a second print,
and who knows, maybe it will
even get an option for a movie.
Stranger things have happened.
Over the next few years, Ian
remained pretty much the same,
that isn't a bad thing,
he's just not quite ready
for a change yet, I
mean who can blame him?
What are we in such a
hurry to grow up for?
Hell, Ian is happier
than most people I know.
When we got back I went to see Melanie,
you remember, the girl
I wanted to miracle fuck
back to life?
Felt great just to sit
across from her and not
have to focus solely on her tits.
I did it this time, but
only because I wanted to.
- Good, cuz you're not invited,
this is a full out guyfest.
- Oh nice, you can
measure your cocks all day long.
- There's gonna be no
cock measuring alright,
we're gonna be too busy
seeing lighthouses, please.
Oh, no lighthouse for
you, sad face, tear tear.
- Carl, lighthouses?
- Why the fuck else are we
gonna go to the beach, really?
- You're gay.
- There's nothing gay about lighthouses.
Lighthouses are like mystical
creatures they're like
unicorns and rainbows, double rainbows.
- If there was a unicorn,
I would bribe it to run
straight into your ass
with its horn.
- Well that would be
really difficult for it,
because I would already be.
- Bent over and waiting?
- Protected by my lighthouse, and then
I would blind the unicorn with
the light from my lighthouse
and your unicorn would die.
- Unicorns didn't even
exist when lighthouses did.
- Cut?
Now we don't gotta tell
nobody, it'll be our thing.
It's cool.
You're getting kinda needy,
I like some distance so just,
well I mean if you have to.
- Carl?
- Oh shit, fuck Robbie, God fuck.
