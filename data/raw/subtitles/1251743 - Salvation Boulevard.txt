It is natural to speak from the heart.
Well ... I guess my
story begins ..
I was in town for the
sight of the dead
And I was trying to get
entry, but needed a miracle ...
And there was.
My truck ran out of gas.
So I left in a parking lot.
The next day I woke
and saw a large building.
And as I needed to go to the bathroom
then I stayed for the mass.
I would have liked to go to show,
I thought I would come home ..
But it was a great party
in the hotel room.
It is always the same, when my
family and I go to church.
We meet, play songs,
we are united ..
People are good here
"City on the Hill" Plan
a Christian community. Pronto.
It began ... Carl!
El Salvador, which was
the sins of this world ..
And he opened the door to another world!
- I can answer?
- Please.
I have only one simple question: What
into with the Spanish Inquisition?
9/11? The Holocaust?
-Disease? -Famine?
Earthquakes -? Where has been
thousands of years of human suffering?
if God exists, has been the most unfair, lazy
capricious bastard of all human history
Ladies and gentlemen.
Pastor Day, what has been
as evidence of the existence of God?
I see evidence of it in
every place I look.
In law, the
nature, culture
In fact, we are in a
auditorium full of evidence!
Is there evidence tonight?
Here!
- I see familiar faces ..
- Yes, my husband!
Come on, son, stand up.
- Is that Carl?
- Yes.
Here we go ...
Not so long ago, Carl was a lost soul
He was a follower of a rock band
called "The Grateful Dead."
"Dead head", is not it?
"Dead head" which is the same
alcohol, promiscuous sex.
Drugs, many drugs!
That lifestyle brought you
much happiness, is not it Carl?
True happiness does not come
to destroy our brains
It comes from the plans
of God for us
And the plans God had for him was to know
a beautiful girl named Gwen and his daughter Angie
They joined the Christ!
You now have a wonderful family.
A job in a
department of my church
But above all this .. love.
He is a man transformed.
Did all this alone?
The smell of God,
are on this man
This is not madness, it is evidence!
I would not call evidence, the
call: changing one drug for another
We ..
I prefer the first drugs to ...

What do you Carl?
Would you read a book?
Always read books ...
How do you think we should

Start at the beginning.
Where does religion?

I agree with some of
our beloved founding fathers
Wine of fear.
Belief in the supernatural, is for
protect our fear of the unknown.
Volcanoes, lightning, earthquakes,
rays. death, evil ...
Somewhere along the
way, the supernatural God became
And the stranger turned, Satan
And if so, the question remains
- Who is the judge between good and evil?
- Perfect.
Without God. everything is permitted.
It would be just a vicious circle
no reason to do good
What would prevent us from

Camera 1, an approach to Dan
I have sad news.
Last night I had the great honor of
discussion with Professor Paul Blaylock.
At the University.
I just found out, last night, Professor
was found in his office on campus.
Victim of a suicide attempt.
The specialists will
operated during the night.
They took the bullet.
Fired, one of its
beloved antique pistols.
And as we meet here with the
love in our hearts, and Jesus Christ ...
The lies in a deep coma.
Our prayers are
with him and his family.
My sermon today, going to be about
changes in our community.
But this incident has touched me
So I decided to talk about something else
Spirituality.
Music for Dan
Sometimes we pretend we are not.
For our friends and family
seem happy and content.
But inside, we
feel alone and empty.
Cut off from God
Road to the darkness. No one
know our secrets.
Listen to my words
He declared war on
this crisis of spirit.
It is the greatest evil
we can find!
Its sole purpose is
our total destruction.
Is that what Jesus wants from us?
No, he wants to fight
I ask each of you now,
ignite the spark in their hearts ...
A spark that will become
flame, which will end the dark ...
And traer–±.la light!
We must fight
this evil, and we will!
And we will win! We will win!
I wish everybody could
hear what he said.
It is so important
-Carl, you had no idea what could
happen, when you were with him last night?
That man is
had nothing to live
if not, believe in nothing,
not yourself.
-Carl, we habar? Hi Jim, Gwen

He wanted to call the
police, but did not

He loves you, Carl.
And he wants to protect you.
The only way that everything goes

Yo, what?
You shot this guy, and
tried to look like a suicide

From studies of the Bible.
If the father and son. that came out ...
God told Abraham to take his
son Isaac to the desert and sacrifice him.
Abraham loved his
son, with all his heart.
'But I loved God more.
-Jerry, Isaac was innocent!
And God changed his mind and
Abraham said to let him go.
- It was a test!
- That's not the point!
Are you right or left handed?

In the same way I saw Jerry
