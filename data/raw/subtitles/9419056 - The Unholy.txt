NEWSCASTER: Next up, a strange
story from our local news affiliate.
FEMALE REPORTER: The town of
Banfield in central Massachusetts.
A paralyzed boy
named Toby Walsh
claims he was healed by
an 18-year-old Alice Pagett.
Images of a miracle
have gone viral.
Bishop James Gyles
of the Boston Archdiocese
has announced a press
conference this morning.
1858, a French girl named
Bernadette Soubirous
claimed to have had
a series of visitations
from the Blessed Virgin
in a grotto
outside the town of Lourdes.
1917, Fátima, Portugal.
Three shepherd children reported
apparitions of the Virgin Mary,
followed by miracles,
prophesies.
1981, Medjugorje, Bosnia.
Six witnesses observed
a Marian apparition.
Many claim that
the Holy Mother continues
to visit this
shrine to this very day.
The present.
All three shrines draw millions
of faithful each year.
In Lourdes alone,
over 5000 miraculous cures
- have been recorded.
- GERRY: Excuse me.
Are you saying that Banfield
could become such a shrine?
Well, first
we have to, uh, confirm
that an actual miracle
has truly occurred.
And that is why
Monsignor Delgarde here
has been tasked by the Vatican
to investigate
these, uh, alleged healings.
Monsignor.
In the 18th century,
Pope Benedict XIV
laid out a procedure
to determine
the veracity of a miracle.
The main steps are:
the illness must be incurable,
the cure must be instantaneous,
the cure must be complete.
In my capacity as inquisitor,
I intend to use all medical
science and technology available
to disprove the alleged miracle
and expose any deceit.
If I fail, the miracle
is to be considered genuine.
Meanwhile,
the church has installed
a shelter over the site
to protect it from the elements
and, uh, public intrusion.
[REPORTERS CLAMORING]
Yes. Yes, yes. Go ahead.
When will we see
Alice Pagett and Toby Walsh?
Well, the Walsh family has asked
for privacy at this time,
and we intend
to respect their wishes.
Uh, Miss Pagett, however,
has, uh, offered
to speak with you
on her own accord.
Alice, you don't have to go...
You don't have to go in there
if you don't want to.
It's okay, Dr. Gates.
This is what the Lady wants.
[REPORTERS CLAMORING]
The lady you claim appeared
to you, is she the Virgin Mary?
REPORTER 1:
And what exactly were her words?
Do you have a history
of any mental illness?
REPORTER 2: Have you received any
financial incentives to make these claims?
[REPORTERS CLAMORING]
What does the lady look like?
She's dressed
in flowing white robes.
She glows like how the sun
shimmers on a hazy day.
And how does she...
How does she speak to you?
Is it a voice in your head?
Alice, have you ever
used drugs before?
When did...?
When did you first see her?
Five nights ago, in the field.
You were there.
And what does Mary want?
Our faith.
I'm, uh... I'm told
we'll have some privacy in here.
Please.
A little surprised
that, ahem,
Father Hagan missed
the press conference.
Uh, yes, well, uh,
Father Hagan is unfortunately
not feeling well.
I am sorry to hear that.
I imagine he is pretty excited
about his church
becoming a shrine.
Yet to be determined.
Alice is speaking
perfectly,
though she has never heard
any form of speech before.
- How do you explain that?
- There are various degrees
of deafness, Mr. Fenn.
Alice may have been
unconsciously hearing all along.
- Come on.
- Are you Catholic?
I was raised Catholic.
Lapsed.
Spiritually and professionally,
it would appear.
My lack of faith
could be an advantage.
Having
a neutral observer along
to record the process
would be healthy.
Now, you may find
someone more devout, but...
But they'd be
accused of bias. Yeah.
Give me the exclusive.
Only I talk to Alice.
I promise you
I will be fair.
And if, for whatever reason,
any of these miracles
turn to be false,
then I personally
will take the hit.
Alice certainly seems
more inclined to talk to you.
Your Grace,
this man's reputation is...
Yes, yes, I know, Vincent.
Everyone deserves
a second chance, though.
Even Mr. Fenn here.

I got this all set up.
Uh, what do you say we do
a couple real easy questions?
How many are gonna watch?
[SIGHS]
Well, that is...
That is hard to say...
but maybe millions.
Mary wants to reach
as many people as possible.
Well, we wanna
make Mary happy, don't we?
Okay.
[CLICKS TONGUE]
There are...
There are people out there that
don't believe in your miracles.
How would you respond
to those folks?
Seeing is believing.
And why do you think
Mary chose you?
Because she gives voice
to the voiceless,
and I've been silent
for a really long time.
I prayed so hard to her,
I yearned to be healed
and she answered.
I opened myself up to Mary
and welcomed her in.
And she heard me, Mr. Fenn.
More than that, she listened.
All my life,
people barely looked at me,
like I was invisible.
But now when I walk into
the room, everybody listens.
You understand
what that's like.
People used to listen to you.
They used to hang
on your every word.
You had so much power,
but now it's gone.
- Wait, wait, Alice, how do you...?
- Mary told me.
She looked at you in the field
and saw someone who needed her.
A soul yearning for her touch.
You and the Lady want
the same thing, Mr. Fenn.
Spread her word.
Seize this chance.
Spread her word and be rewarded.
HAGAN: Alice, you have any
idea what I did with my book?
I can't...
[CLEARS THROAT]
Alice, I'd like to have a word

Uh, Gyles authorized me

Now, imagine...
Imagine what the people
would think
if they were able to actually
see God's work in action?
[SIGHS]
Don't talk to me about God.
You'd sell your soul
for a story, and you know it.
I... I guess I don't understand
what is wrong
with doing some good
and maybe a few people
profiting from it.
Like you and your church.
Everybody wins.
[SNIFFLES]
Everybody.
The bishop thinks a shrine
would be wonderful for Banfield.
Maybe.
I'm not sure it would
be wonderful for Alice.
When God builds a church,
the devil builds
a chapel next door.
I never thought
that I would hear
a Catholic priest
quote Martin Luther.
Mr. Fenn...
we are in an eternal battle
between good and evil.
Wherever God goes,
the unholy follows.
The girl who saw
the Virgin Mary at Lourdes...
the world
treated her like a freak.
She lived out the rest of her
life locked away in a convent.
In Fátima, three children
saw the Virgin Mary.
Two of them were dead
by the end of the year.
Miracles, Mr. Fenn.
[EXHALES SHARPLY]

They're strong acts of faith,

a place of strange
and terrible wonders.

While still a novice,
I disproved a case of stigmata.
Caught the attention

I have read several libraries'

investigated half a dozen
cases of alleged miracles.
Proved them all false.
Oh, you know damn well
I didn't cook this up.
It wouldn't be the first time.
You know,
there's this part in the Bible
about forgiving sins,
kind of a major plot point.

You'll see the mass

They gave him six months tops.
Father Hagan's lungs today.
GERRY:
Wait...
are you saying
that he's healed?
Apparently so.
What about the kid, Toby Walsh?
Are results in for him?
Boston Children's Hospital
diagnosed him
as suffering
from muscular dystrophy.
No cure.
While impossible...
Toby's afflictions
have completely disappeared.
All right, let me make sure
I got this straight,
that I'm not missing something.
There are
three main requirements
to be considered a miracle.
The illness must be incurable,
the cure must be instantaneous
and the cure must be complete.
Correct?
Oh, come on.
This is the real deal.
This is genuine.
It certainly
appears that way, Mr. Fenn.
NEWSCASTER: The main requirements
for a genuine miracle have been met.
The Pope has decreed
that the field
where the Virgin Mary appeared
is a holy shrine.
GERRY:
What does Alice mean to you?
Alice is my hero.
I felt invisible,
just like she did.
But now, seeing
what she's become,
- she inspires me.
- She's holy. You can tell.
She's gonna be bigger
than Taylor Swift. I know it.
Nothing ever happens
in Banfield.
- No.
- This... This is huge, right?
- GERRY: Where you going?
- Anywhere but here.
GERRY: Aren't you happy
about the miracles?
No, sir, I am not.
I like when God stays
where he belongs.
Up there. When he comes
down here, bad things happen.
Floods, plagues of locusts.
The Old Testament God
is wrathful.
What if something
pisses him off?
The impact to the economy of
Banfield cannot be overstated.
In Europe, the shrines
at Lourdes and Fátima
each attract
6 million tourists a year.

Pride before the fall.
Does everyone
quote the Bible around here?
Banfield's always been
a place of faith.
- Faith, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
Faith and superstition.
You know, the first day
I was here,
my farmer friend and I,
we found a kern doll.
- A kern baby.
- Baby, yeah.
- Fields are full of them.
- Yeah.
But according to my farmer
friend, not like this one.
This one was
wrapped up in a chain,
and the chain was stamped
with an impossible date,
February 31st.
- [CLEARS THROAT]
- What?
- Uh, um...
- What?
Kern babies
are good luck, right?
- Yeah.
- But they also believe
that you could trap
bad things in them, and so...
[SIGHS DEEPLY]
You know, they would
wrap it up in a chain
and they would put
an impossible date
on that kern baby,
like February 31st.
And they hoped that
that would just keep
that spirit trapped forever.
So how is Toby Walsh doing?
Actually, he made
the school soccer team.
So it's a real miracle.
Wait a minute. I thought doctors
didn't believe in miracles.
Science and God
are not mutually exclusive.
I could tell you stories.
Fenn?

[MARY SCREAMS]
I've seen this place before.
Pequod Creek?
We used to come here
Easter Sunday
for the church picnics
until they sold it off.
- Wait, this was church property?
- Yeah.
Church owned most of Banfield
ever since Our Lady was built.
When? When was that?
Mid-1800s.
1845?
How did you know that?
[WATER BUBBLING]

May the Lord be in your heart

It's been, oh, some while
since my last confession.
Uh-huh. Go on.
I've taken
the Lord's name in vain,
been covetous,
had impure thoughts...
destroyed many lives,
led many souls
into perdition...
and now I've come for you.
Say three Hail Marys and...
I healed you.
Instead of faith,
you repaid me with doubt.
And what did it gain you?
You discovered the truth
at the expense of your life.
And do you actually believe
you can stop me?
Shall I tell you what happened
to those who have tried?
I stripped the flesh
from their bones.
I slit their windpipes
and watched the breath
slowly leak out.
[GASPS, SCREAMS]

Satan. He gave me the power

I don't get it.
Why would Hagan kill himself?
He had just been healed.
Who knows
what demons plagued him?
This will, of course,
be reported
as a tragic accident.
As I'm sure
you can appreciate,
suicide is somewhat frowned
upon in our profession.
So I must ask for
your discretion in this matter.
Father Hagan was
the shepherd of this community.
You can appreciate
the damage it would do
now that Banfield
has been reborn.
Let me ask you something.
When you turn on the news,
what do you see?
War, famine, disease,
suffering, hate.
The devil is winning, Mr. Fenn.
Faith is the only thing
that stands
between us and perdition.
And this place, this shrine,
will help
strengthen our faith...
thanks to you.
None of it...
would've been
possible without you.

My uncle loved me

He was the only family I had.

She wants us

You know...
your uncle believed

the devil was close behind.
Do you think that...?
Do you think there could be
other forces at play here?
Mary would
never let that happen.
Don't doubt her, Mr. Fenn.
She is the Blessed Virgin.
The mother of God.
Her love for us

NATALIE:
Mary performed miracles.
She could heal the sick.
- Jesus, this is...
- No, no, keep... Keep reading.
NATALIE:
She claimed the Virgin Mary
was speaking through her.
She would heal you if
you pledged your soul to her.
Anyone who challenged her
met tragic ends.
Finally,
the town fought back.
Mary was captured
and submerged
- in the icy waters of...
- Pequod Creek.
Mary confessed
to serving Satan.
As punishment, a mask
was nailed onto Mary's face...
in the image
of the Blessed Virgin.
[MARY GROANS, WHEEZING]

NATALIE: Mary was
hanged by an ancient oak
in the shadow of the church.

Tonight is the Feast

To celebrate,
Mary wants us

[CROWD MURMURING]
NATALIE: After Mary's death,
her miracles were extinguished.
Those she had healed
all relapsed.
Jesus. Father Hagan
must have found this book.
He discovered the truth.
That's why Mary killed him.
Hagan believed that...
wherever God goes,
the unholy follows.
These miracles,
they are not God.
- Join us at this service.
- It's Mary Elnor...
- Pray to Mary.
- ...posing as the Virgin Mary.
- Open your heart to her.
- Doing the devil's work.
She brings an urgent message

The story, no, I, uh...
Listen to me,
I got it all wrong.
Wait, what is this?
Did you get a better offer?
No, you are not listening.
All right? We need to kill it.
Fenn, you're back.
This is your last chance.
You've got it all.
Look, I know you. You would
sell your soul for a story.
I'm pretty sure I already did.
[BEEPS]
We gotta hurry.
Alice is in the convent.
SECRETARY:
Sir, he's in a meeting.
Mr. Fenn.
Before he died, Father Hagan
discovered the truth.
Here, 175 years ago. 1845.
A woman named Mary Elnor
performed exactly
the same healings as Alice.
But the source of her power
wasn't divine. It was satanic.
I know all about this, Mr. Fenn.
As soon as
the first miracle was reported,
I had my staff
research Banfield.
Mary Elnor's confession
is preserved
in the diocese archives.
Why was I not
informed about this?
Informed about what?
An ugly occurrence
of vigilante justice
that happened almost
two centuries ago?
Mary killed him.
Father Hagan
committed suicide, Mr. Fenn.
Bullshit.
She will kill anyone
that tries to stop her.
What do you
expect me to do, hmm?
Call off the service?
What service?
The Lady spoke through Alice.
She asked for a service
to be held at the shrine
to celebrate the Feast
of the Immaculate Conception.
Absolutely not.
You cannot go through with this.
She will claim the souls
of everyone who believes her.
Why? Why do you do this
to yourself, Mr. Fenn, hm?
You have it all.
Why do you want to blow up
your career all over again?
Because it's the truth.
And make no mistake about it,
I will tell the world.
And who would believe you?
No, the sisters won't let me
in to see her. Bishop's orders.
Look, I am in
the diocese archives,
and I think
I found something here.
Uh, listen to this.
Mary's final confession.
She was pregnant.
Before she was captured,
Mary gave birth to a son.
And that infant was claimed
by a local landowner.
Um, all right, his name...
Jesus.
His name is Nicholas Pagett.
Pagett?
Yeah, Alice...
Alice is Mary's descendant.
And Mary made a pact
with the devil
for eternal life and power.
Um...
[READING IN LATIN]
"I live through my children."
Alice.
She's gonna live
again through Alice.

Ah, gentlemen.

He's a troublemaker.
We don't want any,
uh, unnecessary incidents. Okay?
Yes, sir.
Understood.
Thank you.
[PHONE SHUTTER CLICKS]
NATALIE: The bishop has Alice
sequestered till after the service.
DELGARDE:
By then it will be too late.
According to the satanic rites,
Mary will perform a mockery
of the Holy Trinity.
She will call on the faithful
to pledge devotion three times.
The third time,
she will take their souls
and condemn them
to an eternity in hell.
- [ORGAN PLAYING HYMN]
- [CROWD CHATTERING]
So after the choir
finishes the Angelus,
I'll perform the supplications

My queen and my mother,
I give myself entirely to you.
And to show
my devotion to you...
I consecrate to you this day
my eyes, my ears,
my mouth, my heart,
my whole being without reserve.
Wherefore, good mother,
as I am your own,
keep me and guard me
as your property and possession.
Amen.
ALL:
Amen.
[♪♪♪]
Let us pray.
DELGARDE:
This ritual is our last hope.
I will use the kern baby,
imprison her soul
like they did in the past.
It's my fault.
I broke that thing.
I released Mary. I...
I was trying to beef up
what I thought
was a ridiculous story.
- You never told me that.
- I... I tried. I wanted to...
God always offers
an opportunity for redemption.
He often chooses a sinner
to serve his divine purpose.
Wait, are you saying
that God chose me?
I'm saying our Lord works
in mysterious ways.
Some more mysterious
than others.
This calls
for the blessing of a bishop...
or, in a pinch, a monsignor.
Next, the wax
must be sealed by holy fire.
This flame signifies
the presence of the living God.
DELGARDE:
Get back.
[CREAKS]
- [GRUNTS]
- [NATALIE SCREAMS]
Oh, no!
Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, we can't stop Mary
without Delgarde.
Look at all these people
praying to her.
She's feeding off their faith,
growing stronger.
What destroys faith?
Doubt.
Doubt weakens faith.
Doubt leads to damnation.
If we can get those people
to stop believing in Mary,
we can take away her power.
God, the father of heaven,
have mercy on us.
- Lord, have mercy.
