What is the problem?
- Didn't you know? - No.
Come with us, then.
- What is the issue? - Who knows?
What happened?
What is the problem?
Didn't you know?
The demon caught
Mr. Narayanan's son.
Demon? What demon?
- 'Kadappuram' Karthyani.
Good Lord!
She has been taking men
as husbands forcefully.
What does she have to fear?
Anappara Achamma and her goons
protect her, don't they?
That gives her courage.
- It will end today.
Mr. Narayanan is going
to meet Anjooran.
To meet Anjooran?
- To meet Anjooran? - Yes.
This is going to be exciting!
{\an8}'Anjooran.'
{\an8}'No admission for women.'
Mr. Anjooran!
Help us, sir.
Help us, sir.
Help our family and us, sir.
- Help us, sir.
Should I come over
there for that? Come in!
Don't keep the gates open.
Did you lock it?
Are you planning to stay here?
Keep it open!
Stupid!
What is the matter?
- Mr. Anjooran,
you are our last resort.
Why? Did the others die?
Come to the point.
Karthyani's men took
my son Narayanankutty.
Which Karthyani
are you talking about?
A woman named Karthyani
is living on the beach.
She has held his son hostage,
sir.
Complain to the police.
Tell them I said so.
We had gone there
with the police, sir.
She did not free him.
I see.
So I must go and do
the dirty work, right?
I can't!
Get lost!
She is under the protection
of Anappara Achamma.
Achamma's goons
are guarding her.
That is why we are here.
Advocate!
Hey, Advocate!
- I'm here.
You are.
I know that.
Will I call you otherwise?
Summon my sons.
Should we intervene in this,
sir?
Why?
- Doesn't this involve a woman?
Don't you know that Anjoorans
have nothing to do with women?
Drat!
Mr. Advocate
this is not such a case
as per my knowledge.
It involves that old witch
of Anappara and her children.
I will help anyone
who seeks my help
against them.
Anjooran..
- Will help them.
The hell I would!
Do you decide that? I do!
Idiot!
Call them.
What is this
- It's the bill for two months.
Yes?
- Is that you, Balaraman?
Yes, Dad. This is Balaraman.
- You must come here.
I will, Dad.
- Make it quick.
I will come over right now.
Keep this aside.
I will attend to it later.
What? - I must produce this
to the Sales Tax office by noon.
Tell them it went missing.
Get lost!
What?
I am ringing bells on my own.
Who is giving me company?
Keep that treasure on the table.
Can't you hear the
phone ringing, my dear?
Yes. - Can't you see what we
are doing, my dear? - Yes.
Then pick up the phone, dimwit!
Where were we?
It's for you.
- No!
Preman,
check which devil is calling.
Serve the food.
Hello. Who is this? - The devil
who married your mother.
Oh, no!
Brother, it is our father.
Who? - Our father!
- Oh, no! Lord Hanuman!
Shall I call Swaminathan, Dad?
- No need.
Take him and come here at once.
We will come over right
now, Dad. We will.
Preman, take this.
I have some work to do.
Oh, no!
Imbecile! Can't you
recognise our father's voice?
I couldn't.
- In that case, you're fired!
Get lost!
Hello.
- Is this the Law College Hostel?
Yes.
- I need to speak to Ramabhadran.
Just a minute.
Yes. Ramabhadran speaking.
- Don't you have classes today?
I did... I went..
And came back..
To go again.. I went..
You called..
Enough!
- I didn't go.
I will go at noon.
- No need.
Come home.
- No, Dad. I will go for sure.
That's not it.
We have an issue.
Is that so?
I will come over right now.
What brings you gentlemen
to these poor people's hut?
You're poor, aren't you?
I see.
Didn't you..
Didn't you tell me they
were Achamma's goons?
Go.
Go and get your son back.
You're here for the kid,
aren't you? - Not possible, sir.
Why? Can't he
walk? What a shame!
We'll carry him, then.
Won't you lift him? - Yes.
- He will do it.
Hey!
You won't take him.
We will.
- Sir, this is the beach.
I carry fish with this hand.
It is going to stink.
I wash my rear with this hand.
This will suffice for you.
Go away!
Take this!
Who wants to take my husband away?
Tell me!
Who wants to do so?
Are you the mighty men
who are here for that?
What good are you if you have
never been with a woman?
Come, if you're man enough!
Try laying your hands on me!
I shall show you my might.
Come!
Come if you can, you swine!
Thank you.
Dear students.
This is the first time
in my period of service that
I have to send off a student
because she is getting married.
She has been blessed with the
privilege to tie the knot
with Mr. Shyama Prasad,
the young Home
Minister of Kerala.
With the hopes and wishes
for a bright, happy future
and a life filled
with prosperity
let's all bid Malu
a wonderful farewell.
Malu, may I talk to you?
Please come with me.
Will you help me out, Malu?
What is the matter, Matron?
- Here.
What is this?
- This is my transfer request.
Malu must help me out.
- Me?
Yes. Being his wife's
first recommendation
the Minister won't deny.
Please don't neglect this.
You must help me out, Malu.
Oh, no.
Let me talk to him.
What comes later would
be your luck. - Thank you, Malu.
Thank you very much.
- I shall leave. - Okay.
I shall see you soon.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Malu, please don't forget.
Try to present the matter
on your first night if you can.
Okay, Matron.
I would do my best.
I shall see you. - Okay.
- Beena, bye!
Is she asking for
a recommendation?
Yes.
- Many come home as well..
with the hopes of getting
things done by the Minister.
By the time the marriage
takes place
not a single soul will go
to Mr. Anjooran's place.
The entire village would seek
help from Anappara.
Probably to meet
Anappara Achamma.
She is so happy,
isn't she?
Not just happy.
She has been practising with
the elephants since morning.
What for?
- For the marriage.
It seems like the elephants
would be sprinkling
the rosewater.
Sprinkle it.
Sprinkle it.
- Sprinkle it.
Sprinkle it here.
Sprinkle the rosewater.
How did you qualify
to become a mahout?
Give it here.
I shall show you.
Sprinkle the rosewater.
Do it right here.
Sprinkle it.
So you have both rosewater
and elephant waste.
Are you satisfied now?
Get rid of the dung.
Or else, my brother
would get angry.
What! How does elephant
dung matter to him? Get lost!
Teach him.
- Sprinkle it here.
I asked you to sprinkle it.
What are you staring at?
Who asked you bring
the elephants here?
I did.
- Will you stop this, Mom?
The work there was delayed
due to the lack of elephants.
Are you practising
a parade with the elephants?
Really?
Is it important
to sprinkle rosewater
at my grandchild's wedding?
It is supposed to be auspicious.
Then why don't you assign those
elephants to serve food as well?
Didn't I..
- Veerabhadran.
Don't pretend to be my father.
I will decide what the elephants
of Anappara must do.
Get inside. - Mom..
- Get back inside.
Damn..
- Sprinkle the damn water.
Sprinkle the water.
Sprinkle the water.
Oh.
How could you let mom do this
in spite of being here?
It is going to be a much
anticipated crowd for the wedding.
And she is going to arrange
elephants for the occasion.
What can I do about it?
Do you want me to sprinkle
the rosewater instead?
No, please continue to work out.
You better watch your words.
Why don't you advise mom?
Here we go again.
The two of you have begun
your arguments. Can't you stop it?
What do you want, Veerabhadran?
No elephants on the wedding day.
Am I right? - Yes.
I have already done
the needful for it.
What do you mean?
- You see.
I had stuffed one
kilogram of cotton
inside the elephant's ears
before bringing them here.
They won't even hear
the sound of crackers.
Do you expect them to interpret
how to sprinkle water?
Mom would give up
once she realises
that there's no use talking.
How is my idea?
Just brilliant..
Why did you stop
with the elephants?
Why don't you stuff some
in your mother's ears as well?
I am warning you.
This is the wedding
of a motherless child.
You can expect more than just
elephants on the wedding day.
Only the good-hearted
ones may remain here.
Is that understood?
I don't know, dear Lord.
I hope the elephants don't end up
trampling our wedding guests.
Oh, here is my queen.
My dear child.
Achamma.
- Let's go.
We heard that you were given
a great farewell at college.
Oh, don't tease her.
This is nothing new in college.
Isn't that right, Malu?
Of course.
My college mates did a similar
farewell for me during my wedding.
Right!
I'm sure they did something grand
as you were marrying this idiot.
Let's go inside, dear.
Uncle, where is my dad?
He has gone to visit the Minister.
He has been gone for a while now.
I think he couldn't meet him.
Just get lost.
Did he disappear
into thin air for that?
What brings you here, Advocate?
- Oh, yes.
Please ask someone to come down.
I can't do this on my own.
I need help to carry this.
Is nobody down there
to help him out?
What is the matter?
Please give him a hand.
They have sent something.
Okay.
Oh, no.
Dad.
Help him out.
Oh, God.
Dad..
Please move aside.
Let him breathe.
What happened, Brother?
- What happened, Dad? - Water.
Get him a glass of water.
Dad.
- What happened, Brother?
Tell us what is wrong?
- What happened, Advocate?
Can't you speak?
Tell us what happened.
How do I present it?
By using your mouth.
Will you just spit it out?
This marriage won't take place.
The Minister is reluctant to have
an alliance with our family.
The Minister was forced to say so
to ruin this wedding.
What did you just say?
The wedding of a girl
from Anappara got ruined?
Who is bold enough to do so?
Tell me!
Who the hell
is bold enough to do so?
What is the point
in questioning me?
You must question Mr. Anjooran.
He is the one who ruined
this wedding.
Mr. Anjooran had six MLAs to
talk it out to the minister that
the Government would lose their
support if the
wedding takes place.
Finally, when the government
was about to fall apart
he decided not to get married.
Anappara family thought they
would succeed in rallying
the Home Minister
on their side to defeat me.
I just spat because I got
the better of Anappara family.
Why did you spit?
It's because you just
spat in my mouth.
It happened because you are sitting
exactly where my spit would land.
Sit over there. - If I do,
I won't be able to hear you.
Like you're going to do something
after hearing me. Move over!
Oh!
Why are you scooching?
Stand up first
and then move over.
I'm not going to stop at this.
That woman and her children
are going to suffer even more.
I will kill him!
I swear that I'll kill that old man
today! - Mom, what are you doing?
We are here to avenge.
- Avenge, my foot!
Then take this and go there.
Kill him if you have the guts.
- What is happening here?
We have him, an Advocate
and all my wealth.
Go and kill him. I'm no
stranger to cases and trials.
Achamma, are you out of your mind?
- Yes, I am.
Consider that I have gone mad.
You should plead during my trial
that I killed him because I'm mad.
Stop staring and take the gun
from her. - Mom, stop!
I swear I will shoot if you try
to stop me. Don't come near me.
Mom, hand over the gun.
- No!
Hand over the gun! - Leave me.
- Give me the gun. - Give it.
Listen to us, Mom. - Just move,
I'll take the gun from her.
Oh, God!
Don't bite me! Oh, no!
What are you doing, Mom?
Stop biting him.. - Stop it, Mom.
Stop it!
Excellent! This is the worst thing
that could happen to them.
I guess your sons
can lead peaceful lives from now.
Their lives are peaceful even now.
Boss, if I may ask..
Do you think
their lives are ideal?
They keep getting into brawls
either to help others
or to get the better
of Anappara family.
Don't you think even
they deserve normal lives?
No.
Isn't it time to let go
of your obstinacy?
It's been 20 years since that
unfortunate event occurred.
Why don't you just stop it
once and for all?
Why don't you forget the past?
Should I forget everything
that happened in the past?
What do you want me to forget?
Answer me.
What do you want me to forget?
My beloved Lakshmi,
the life of this house..
She was slashed
right in front of my eyes.
I held her in my arms
as she took her last breath.
Do you want me to forget that?
Do you want me to forget
how much I suffered
during the 14 years that I
spent in the Central Prison
at Poojappura? Answer me!
You asked me if my sons
don't deserve to lead normal lives.
Have you thought about why aren't
they leading normal lives now?
Why didn't Balaraman get married?
Why didn't Swaminathan
and Premachandran get married?
Why hasn't this house witnessed
the playfulness of another child
after Ramabhadran?
Answer me!
Come on, answer me.
I will never forget all this.
I won't stop
until that family ends up
annihilated.
Stop it.
To hell with your fan!
All that I care about
now is retaliation.
Your dad has never let Anjooran get
the better of him till his death.
I have made sure that he
always prevailed over him.
I even made sure that
I have as many sons as he does.
I made sure that I matched him
in the number of sons.
But now I realise that my
sons are short of manliness.
Damn! - Bhoomi, getting
frustrated isn't going to help.
You can't blame
her for what she said.
Anjooran has four sons
who are like the four of you.
But why haven't you managed to get
the better of them till now?
You aren't short of intelligence,
power or wealth, are you?
It is simply because they have
a better sense of unity.
Anjooran's sons
follow his orders without fail.
But that isn't the case here.
You tend to prioritise
the opinions of your wives.
Try to talk some
sense into them, Advocate!
Just look at that!
This is what women can do.
Didn't you see how
they followed their wives.
If they are to split up, there
should be a woman in that family.
Their strength is that they
don't have a woman in their family.
If one of them falls in love
neither you nor I or the court
need to do anything
for she will ruin them.
I mean, she would turn out to be
the reason for the destruction
of Anjooran's family.
What do you say?
- Shut up! - What?
Stop with this nonsense!
How could you talk about
the marriage of Anjooran's sons
when my daughter is depressed
that her wedding got called off?
I guess all that can be done now is
send her back to college.
We know what to do.
She said that she wouldn't
resume her education.
She would say that but
staying here would only
make her more depressed.
That's why I suggest that she
should be sent to college.
Malu is coming back and we will be
giving her a warm reception.
Please make generous contributions
to make it a grand success.
Come on.. Contribute..
Hey, stop!
Stop swaggering around
and contribute something.
Oh!
Mercy is coming.
That idiot has already
started with his antics.
Welcome..
Mercy is coming!
Mercy, please show us some mercy.
Please make
a significant contribution.
It is to organise a warm reception
for Malu. Please.. - No, I can't.
Would you tell me why?
We aren't willing to. - I don't
care, I just need the money.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Why? I'm not sitting here
idle. I'm begging. Don't you see?
If you don't have the money,
I shall give you some.
Hey, Mayin Kutty!
Even Anjooran's son could
contribute! Come on.
You start collecting money the
moment I tell you about something.
Since it's I who have planned the
event, I shall meet its expenses.
It is not to meet the event's
expenses. - I know your intention
and I will not let you do that.
It doesn't matter whether the money
is with you or me.
In that case,
I will keep the money.
If these guys have no objections,
I don't have any either.
The reception that we are going
to give her should be spectacular.
It should better the farewell that
her friends had arranged for her.
Okay? God!
- Okay.
Driver, start the car.
"The Minister's missus is coming!"
"Let's give her a round of applause
and a warm reception."
"Let's give her
the appropriate greeting."
"Let's give her a gun salute."
"All those among you who couldn't
attend the wedding"
"and who doesn't know her story"
"she is the Home Minister's missus!
She loves to show off!"
"She is the Home Minister's missus!
She loves to show off!"
"She had even planned to allocate
security for Anappara Achamma!"
"The Minister's missus is coming!"
"Let's give her a
round of applause
and a warm reception."
"Let's give her
the appropriate greeting."
"She never thought she would have
to make.. - A swift return."
"And when she..
- Reached here.."
"She was overwhelmed..
- By this warm reception."
"We are advocates.
- Aren't we?"
"Won't you let us plead your
case? - You should."
"Pay us and we will
plead your case."
"She never thought she would have
to make.. - A swift return."
"And when she..
- Reached here"
"she was overwhelmed..
- By this warm reception."
"We are advocates.
- Aren't we?"
"Won't you let us plead your
case? - You should."
"Pay us and we will
plead your case."
"First, it was your horoscope,
and now it's the court!"
"Would it be a civil case
or a criminal case?"
"It looks like the Anappara family
is going to have a tough time!"
"The Minister's missus is coming!"
"Let's give her a round of applause
and a warm reception."
"Let's give her
the appropriate greeting."
Oh, no!
My dear..
Oh, God?
What happened to her?
What happened?
Why is she crying?
What's wrong, Mom?
- I don't know.
Tell us what happened. - How
would I know? She hasn't told me.
Malu, why are you crying?
Tell us what happened.
Please answer us, dear.
Tell us whatever it is.
I had told you that I didn't want
to go back to college, hadn't I?
Then why did all of you
force me to go back?
Are you happy now
that he has insulted me
in front of everyone in college?
Are you happy now that I was
humiliated to the core?
Who?
- Who insulted you?
Didn't you hear them?
Tell us who insulted you.
Who else would it be?
Anjooran's son, Ramabhadran.
We have to teach him a lesson.
Veerabhadran, start the jeep.
Stop!
I've never before seen this courage
and thirst for revenge from you.
Where did it all come from now?
Get inside. - Mom, this isn't
something that we could let go off.
How dare he insult
someone from our family!
I swear I will rip him apart.
Come on.
- Stop!
I asked you
to get inside the house.
Get inside!
Stop!
Don't try to pamper me.
I started attending college
for your sake.
But now, no one in the family
cares about the fact
that I was humiliated.
Who told you that
no one cares about it?
Then why did you stop my dad
and uncles when
they were going to make him pay
for what he did to me?
You were only worried
about them, weren't you?
I know you prioritise
your children, Grandmother.
You don't care about me.
Don't be so stupid!
Is this what you thought
about me all this while?
It was neither I
nor your dad or your uncles
who were humiliated
by him today at the college.
It was you that he humiliated.
So, who should make
him pay for it? You.
It's you who should
make him pay for it.
What the advocate
said is a fact.
No man could get the
better of Anjooran and his sons.
Only a beautiful girl
like you is capable of it.
What is he like? Is he handsome?
- Who?
Anjooran's son. - I don't know.
I haven't looked at him.
You should. I want you to fix
your gaze on him from now.
You should make him
fall in love with you.
What are you saying? Do you
want me to fall in love with him?
I won't spare you
if you fall in love with him.
I want you to pretend
that you are in love with him.
And as time flows by,
you should bind him in your love.
He should be willing
to murder, if you ask him to.
He should even chop off Anjooran's
head if you ask him to.
You should make them pay
for ruining your wedding,
for humiliating you
and for all the agony
that you had to endure.
You will.
I will help you to do it.
22, 23
24.
- Pour some oil..
"The Minister's missus is coming.."
Where is Ramabhadran's room?
It's upstairs. Room number six.
Do you want me to call him?
No. I shall go
and see him by myself.
Ramabhadran..
Hey!
Wake up.
- What are you doing, idiot?
Get up. She is coming here.
- Who are you referring to?
It's Malu.
- What?
She will be here
any second now. Get up.
I can't find my Dhoti. - Aren't you
wearing it? - Oh, no! - Damn!
Check if it's under the cot.
- Yes, it is.
Hurry up.
What?
Can I have a word
with you, Ramabhadran?
Oh, I see! - Stop.
- I'm sorry, here you go.
Not that. You needn't say anything
that you don't want him to hear.
It is something
that concerns only the two of us.
So, we should have
a private conversation.
Here.
I'm sorry.
May I come in?
No..
You may speak only if you
can do it standing there.
I certainly can't.
Oh, no!
What is wrong with you?
This room is occupied by men.
But I was told that
it's you who occupies this room.
How dare you! I want you to step
outside of my room right now.
I have no plans to stay here.
I will leave right away.
But I will leave only
after you hear me out.
Why are you harassing me
despite the fact
that I have never wronged you?
Do you think it is fair to take
revenge on me if my family
had wronged yours when
I wasn't even born?
Your father ruined my wedding.
Please don't ruin
my studies as well.
I'm begging for your mercy.
Please stop harassing me.
When a woman pleads for mercy
a man would stop harassing her,
even if she is his foe.
A real man would
understand that.
I believe that you are
a real man, Ramabhadran.
Did you hear what she just said?
She believes that
you are a real man.
Didn't you understand her?
- What?
She meant that none of the others
in your family are men.
She meant that your brothers
aren't men.
That is why they are
all still unmarried.
When did she say that?
She said it right now, you idiot!
Didn't I reply to that, idiot?
- No!
Oh, no! - You just have a blanket
wrapped around you. - Damn!
Hey!
How dare you say that my
brothers are not men.
Oh!
That's new to me.
Is it true?
Don't you dare mess
with Anjooran's sons!
We are no strangers to hooliganism.
Why are you speaking ill
about your brothers?
You said that they aren't men,
now you say that they're thugs.
What's wrong with you?
- Enough! Stop!
What's so funny?
Get lost!
You requested me not to insult
you or harass you anymore. - Yes.
Just because you belong
to Anappara family
I will insult you, harass you
and humiliate you.
I will hurt you
in all possible ways.
I loathe you!
You are nothing
but a disgusting animal!
Are you done talking?
- No, I will..
What if I'm done talking?
I don't care even if you loathe me
because I love you all the more.
- What?
I'm in love with you.
Why are you in love with me?
I won't let you do that.
You don't hate me with my consent.
So I can love you.
I won't let you love me.
Let me see if you can stop me.
- You may fall in love..
You may fall in love
with anyone but me.
It's not as if I'm asking you
to love me back.
You wouldn't dare to.
You will regret it.
Then even you don't have
to tell me anything more.
I'm in love with you..
Can you hear anything?
- What? - No.
I won't tolerate this nonsense!
This is not where you settle the
conflicts between your families.
I don't care how influential
your father is. If you carry..
on with your misconduct, I will
expel you from this institution.
Sir, as I said earlier,
Ramabhadran is innocent.
I'm the one who is guilty.
I don't want to listen
to anything more.
Do you even know how many times
I have let you go with a warning?
I haven't kept count. - Keep this
in mind. This is my last warning.
And you should
be grateful to her for that.
You may leave.
Didn't you hear me?
What happened?
- I couldn't hear anything.
Do you need my help to settle it?
Answer me.
What did you just do, Malu?
You could have easily got him
expelled from the college today.
He must not go.
I want him to be in the college.
What are you saying?
Just see what
I'm going to do to him.
What are you doing?
Why are you packing your bags?
You should send her packing.
She is very dramatic
saying that she loves me.
You should say that
you love her as well.
No way!
My brothers and I will never
fall in love in this lifetime.
How can you be so sure?
Don't make me
show you my true colours.
I see it every day.
Do you have something else to say?
Shut up!
Why are you adamant
that I should love her back?
I didn't say that you should
love her. You should never do it!
You shouldn't, even if your
life depends on it. - Then?
Just pretend that you
are in love with her. - Why?
So that you could teach
Anappara family a lesson.
Do you want to get the better
of Anappara family or not?
Go on..
Ramabhadran,
it's she who has started it.
This is the best opportunity
for you to destroy that family.
First, you should charm
her with your love
and then turn the tables
all of a sudden.
If you succeed in doing that,
Anappara Achamma
and her sons will bow
in front of you.
They will beg for your mercy.
Just imagine how proud
your family would be about you!
Oh! I am getting goose bumps
thinking about it.
Would it be a problem? - No,
this will be fine in a minute.
Not this. - I get it! You're asking
if it would be a problem for them.
It would.
Do you have a problem with that?
It should be a problem for them.
- Exactly.
Tell her that you love her.
Go on.
Hey. - Did you tell her?
- No.
What was the first line?
I couldn't sleep..
I couldn't sleep last night.
Start with this line. Go.
Last night..
Such a horrible tone!
Last night..
This one is fine.
Excuse me, Malu.
Could you please
come here for a minute?
Just a minute.
What is it?
Why did you call me?
I couldn't sleep last night.
- Even I couldn't.
I know that even you
weren't able to sleep.
And I know that I am
the reason for it - No!
It wasn't because of you.
It was because of the mosquitoes
in my room.
Your sense of humour,
fearlessness and smartness..
This is what I love about you.
I don't know
if you would believe it..
I don't know if you'd believe it,
but I've got to tell you this.
This is the first time
that a beautiful girl
like you have confessed
her love for me.
It..
It has touched my heart.
I came here as I wanted to confess
my feelings for you as well.
I'm in love with you.
I love you.
Hey.
Don't leave so soon.
I have to be convinced.
Did you mean
what you just said? - Yes.
Did those words come from
the depth of your heart? - Yes.
Then can you make a promise?
Of course.
I want you to promise
on your mother who has passed away.
Promise me that you would
disown your father
and brothers for me.
You don't have to do it now.
Give it some thought. See you.
Let's go.. - What happened?
- Come on. - What did she say?
She wants to disrupt my peace.
She wants me to promise
on my late mother. - Be realistic!
Your mother is no more.
A promise won't do any harm to her.
My mother..
- She is just playing mind games.
You should do the same by asking
her to make the same promise.
What if she does? - Accept it
and do the same. - No way!
I'm Anjooran's son.
I'm supposed to stick to my words
no matter what. - Listen.
You should be wise not to let
those words influence
your actions.
Do you understand?
- Now go to her.
Excuse me, Malu.
Please come here.
Did you make up your mind so soon?
- Yes.
Did you give it a deep thought?
I did,
and I've made my decision.
I too want you to promise
on your late mother.
Why not?
- Extend your hand.
Why?
- To make my promise.
You don't have
to hold my hand for that.
I trust your words.
What?
Come on, extend your hand.
Why are you perspiring heavily?
No, I'm not.
Just make the promise..
Okay. I promise on my late mother
that I belong to you from now.
I will disown my family and come
with you when you want me to.
I promise.
- Okay.

Stop.
I will get down here.
What?
How long have you
been waiting, Uncle?
Here. - Uncle, there is nothing
between us.
This..
- Later. Keep this inside first.
No. Come.
You must know the truth.
Didn't I tell you that we
shall discuss it later?
Keep this inside and come.
We will talk.
What are you up to?
Anjooran's sons
will have many intentions.
I don't have to disclose
it to people like you.
If you love her sincerely
I will be there to help you.
But if you are doing this
trying to take revenge..
I will be the first one
to slash you.
Yes. That is my intention.
Slash me if you can!
Hey!
Who is it?
Who is attacking Ramabhadran?
Don't! This is an issue
between our families.
You may come once
one of us falls dead.
Move!
God!
Don't.. Ramabhadran!
Move! Listen to me!
Leave him, Veerabhadran!
Hey! Oh, God!
Move..
Don't, Ramabhadran!
Leave him..
Let go, will you?
Oh, no!
God!
Lord!
Move!
Leave me.
- Leave him..
God..
Move! God!
Malu..
Your uncle and Ramabhadran
are fighting.
If you don't go soon, someone will
die for sure. Come. Quick!
Ramabhadran, stop it.
- I will..
Uncle!
- Stop!
Uncle, stop it. Uncle.
- I will kill you.
I will kill you.
- Let me see you do that.
Stop fighting, listen to me.
- Leave me.
Leave me.
- That's enough, Ramabhadran.
I won't leave you alone,
you scoundrel.
Get out of here
if you don't want to get hurt.
Leave me..
What have you done?
I told you that I don't like him.
Then why did you
fight with him?
Do you think that I'm stupid
enough to fall in love with him?
What did I see then?
Didn't you hear me?
What did I see?
I did it because
grandmother told me to.
To create issues between
Anjooran and his sons.
My God!
Your grandmother is crazy.
How could you.. Do you
have any idea who they are?
If they learn about this,
they will kill both of you.
Your grandmother wants
revenge now. Do you know..
You were supposed
to be born in that family.
Your mother was supposed to marry
Anjooran's eldest son Balaraman.
Do you know what your grandmother
did to sabotage that wedding?
She took your mother
from the wedding venue
and got her married to your father.
Anjooran hasn't done
anything worse to you.
When Anjooran lost
his wife that day
we lost our father.
When his wife died on
the streets inch by inch
he killed our father mercilessly.
Do you want to start
what ended that day?
Do you want us all
to relive those moments again?
Tell me!
What is your intention?
No, Uncle.
I will stop everything right now.
But please don't tell this at home.
There's no use in telling this
at home. They will hit you.
They won't let you
attend college anymore.
But if his family gets to know
about this, things will go haywire.
His ruthless brothers
will come looking for us.
Ramabhadran..
Ramabhadran, your brothers
are coming. - What?
They got to know about the fight.
Hide somewhere quick.
My God!
- God!
Did you tell them that I'm here?
- No, should I tell them?
No. Tell them that I'm not here.
Go.
That won't work.
I will hide with you as well.
What are you doing?
Tell them I'm not here. Go.
I won't do it. They will beat
me up. Why don't you tell them?
I told you.. Oh! He left.
What?
Listen to me.
Your brothers will..
Listen to me, Ramabhadran.
- I told you to get out! - God!
Ramabhadran, open up.
Listen to me.
Who hit our brother? Tell us.
- I'm just the warden.
I don't care.
Who did it?
Who hit our brother?
Come out if you dare.
Come out. We will show you
what we can do. Come out.
Come out.
- Come out! Let's settle this.
Yes, let's settle this right here.
I want to know who hit our brother.
Come out. - There he goes,
the guy who hit Ramabhadran.
Get him..
You! Stop right there.
- Stop there.
Who built this wall right here?
Damn!
Where did he go?
You! - Leave me.
- Sorry, Brother.
College kids are hard to keep
up with. I have experience.
We could have beaten him up.
- Come. - Come.
My God, help me!
There he goes. Get him, Preman.
- Catch him..
Someone, help me.
- Let's go. He is calling us.
God!
What is this?
Who put this here?
Hey! Get up.
- Please don't hurt me.
Get up, you idiot. - What is it?
- D you want to know the reason?
This is the reason.
How dare you hit him?
- It wasn't me. - Who was it?
My God! - Get him up.
- Stop hitting me. God!
Shut up. I will kill you.
- They are about to kill me!
My God!
Ramabhadran!
You hit our brother!
- I have got him.
Hit him, Preman!
My God.
I will teach you how to hit.
- I will do it.
Don't hurt him. He didn't hit me.
Don't hurt him.
Don't hurt me.
- Why did he run if it wasn't him?
Why did you run?
- God, I ran because I was scared.
If you're scared of God,
why did you run when you saw us?
If it's not him,
then who hit you?
Didn't you hear him?
Who hit you?
Nobody hit me. I hit someone.
- Whom did you hit?
Tell me,
whom did you fight with?
If I tell you, please
don't create more issues.
Veerabhadran from Anappara.
I fought with him.
Come. - Listen to me, Brother.
He didn't hurt me, I hit him.
Move. - Brother.
- Get out of my sight.
Brother, please!
- Move.
Then kill me before you leave.
It's embarrassing for me
if you go there on my behalf.
It's a shame if they get to know
that I need your help
to handle such things.
It's true. He didn't touch me.
Don't go there and create trouble.
Are you telling the truth?
- Yes, Brother.
If they come back again, make
sure you destroy them. - Okay.
We will take care of the rest.
- Okay.
Come here. - What?
- Not you. I called him.
Mayin Kutty, come here.
What is it? - What are you
studying for? - Final year LLB.
That's not what I asked you.
Why are you in college?
You studying here is a waste of
time. Don't spoil the institution.
Ew!
Correct. - I'm leaving.
- Okay.
I heard that you hit my brother.
I will let it slide for now.
But if you repeat it one more time
I'll kill you and have you buried.
Keep that in mind.
What did you want to tell me?
If it's about the fight with your
uncle, it wasn't my mistake.
Who is he to tell me
not to see you?
No matter what happens
I won't back off
from this relationship.
Ramabhadran!
I don't love you
like you think I do.
What?
Please forgive me.
I lied to you all this time.
Everything I said
and did was a lie.
I was cheating you.
It was all because
of my grandmother.
But now, after knowing how much
our families hate each other
I have to put an end to this.
I don't want
to exact revenge anymore.
You should forget everything,
Ramabhadran.
I'm leaving.
Stop. I too have something to say.
Listen to what I have to say.
Do you think
that I love you?
Look at yourself!
It was Mayin Kutty's idea
to use you to destroy your family.
That's why I started
this relationship with you.
Not because I wanted to marry
you and cherish you forever.
Do you understand?
Now that you are ending this,
even I will do the same.
What did you say?
That I should forget you?
I am erasing you
from my memory for ever.
I hate you so much.
I loathe you. Goodbye.
God!
What is all this?
Why won't you let me sleep?
How can you sleep when
I'm here wide awake?
Did I ask you not to sleep?
- You are the one responsible.
You told me to love her. And you
are here sleeping peacefully?
You are the one who told her
that you don't love her.
Then what is the problem now?
I did say that. But I can't do it.
She is always on my mind.
What? Did we mess up?
- Yes, I think so.
God!
Why are you scaring me?
- You are the one who scared me.
I came to comfort you.
- Is this how you comfort me?
I was thinking about what my
father and brothers would do.
This is not the time to comfort me.
There's no point in being
worried now.
If you truly love her,
then you should not back out.
No matter what happens,
you should marry her.
I have a lot to think about
before making a decision.
Then sit here
and think about it till dawn.
And I will think about it
while sleeping. Okay?
Don't disturb me while
I'm thinking. Good night.
What are you doing here
in the hostel late at night?
Don't shout.
I felt like seeing you right now.
That's why I came.
I was trying to hate you and
forget you. But I couldn't.
I don't think I can ever do it.
I just realised it now.
I am deeply in love with you.
I love you, Malu.
I love you.
I know that you love me, too.
I need to hear it from you.
Ramabhadran.. - Not now. I'll come
tomorrow morning. Good night.
Hello, are you having
a comfortable stay here?
Let me know if you need anything.
- Come.
I need to see you later.
Excuse me. - Yes.
- I am here to meet Malu.
Malu? - Yes.
- Malu left the hostel.
Someone from her family picked
her up in the morning.
What is it?
What is the problem?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Bye.
Did her family get to know
about your relationship?
Ramabhadran. Malu left because
she doesn't want to see you again.
We didn't know until the last
minute. She left in the morning.
She asked us to inform you that
she doesn't wish
to see you again.
She could have told me this
in person. I would have understood.
I will meet her now.
Even if I have to go to Anappara.
How will we go to Anappara?
- Come with me.
What exactly is the problem?
Hey.. Wait up for me.
{\an8}"I am not a poet.."
"I am not a poet."
"But, my beloved.."
Stop here..
You wait here. I will go inside.
- I will also come with you.
Why do you want to come?
- For courage.
I'm brave enough. - I'm not.
I can't stand here alone.
If we have to die, we will
die together. - Hush!
If we have to die, we will
die together. - Come..
Should we break the lock?
- Let's jump.
'She says that when you were
young, on your birthday..'
Hold tight.
- Yes.
If there's trouble, just whistle.
- And then what?
I will inform your family.
- Shut up, you idiot!
'That's why you
were severely punished.'
'Punished?
- Yes.'
'Your dad said you don't
deserve to stay in the house.'
'That's why he sent you off.'
'Do you even realise that?'
'Is this true?'
What is it?
- I got scared. The movie..
Stop smiling
and get out of here.
Tell me that you love me.
- Please leave.
Leave before someone sees you.
I won't leave unless
you tell me that you love me.
I will be hiding
in the storage room.
I won't leave unless you tell me
that you love me,
even if it's dawn.
Okay?
Where are you going?
It's this way.
I'm going to sit inside there.
- For what?
I have a plan. Let me go.
- This is dangerous.
That's what I like.
Leave me.
Listen to me, Ramabhadran.
My God!
What is that?
Who left the storage room open?
Hey, mister.
- Did you call me?
Lock that room.
- Okay.
"We both.."
"are locked inside a room."
Set the dog loose.
You can't trust anyone
these days.
Get away, dog!
Why is the dog barking
looking at that room?
Come here.
Check if there is some animal
in the storage room.
Go with him.
The dog is barking.
Go and take a look.
Bring the torch.
I'm in trouble.
Jackie, go.
What is that?
Get him!
- Hey!
Stop there.
- Thief..
I told you to stop.
- Get him..
Don't hurt me..
Come here.
Weren't you the one who stole
the utensils from here?
I'm not a thief. I'm Mayin Kutty.
I'm Malu's classmate.
I came to borrow a book from her.
Why did you jump the wall
to get a book?
I thought not to disturb anyone
because it's night-time.
That is some thinking.
One look at him, and you
can tell that he is trouble.
He looks like a thief.
No, it's genetic. Everyone
in my family has the same look.
My God, so the whole family
consists of thieves?
We should hand him over
to the police.
Before that, please ask Malu
if I'm her classmate.
Malu!
- Malu.
I will hit you.
Malu.
Malu!
- Go inside, I will come now.
What is it, Dad?
- Do you know him?
This is.. - Mayin Kutty.
- Yes, Mayin.
He is my classmate.
- I was telling the truth.
They wouldn't leave me, Malu.
- Why? - I don't know.
What is it, Dad?
- What is it?
It's nothing.
Go inside.
I'm going, Mayin Kutty.
- Okay, Malu.
You can go.
Get out of here.
- Okay.
Stop there.
Who were you looking for?
I didn't look.
- Where is he? - Who?
The guy who came with you.
- Nobody was with me.
Come out of there.
Come out quick.
I won't leave unless you say it.
- Listen to me, Ramabhadran.
Tell me, should I leave or not?
Leave before
someone finds you.
Where is Ramabhadran?
Tell me, you idiot.
Are you going to tell me or not?
- Ramabhadran, please.
It's all right, then.
I will sit inside.
No need.
- Wait, I will tell you.
Tell me. - I will tell you.
Tell me. - I will tell you.
I'll tell. - Tell me.
He.. - Where is he?
He is in the storage room.
I just don't love you. You are
more dear to me than anything else.
You are my life.
Is that okay?
Thank you. Thank you, Malu.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
What are you doing here?
- Nothing.
Go inside.
- Okay.
You can love her, marry her,
or do whatever you want.
Why should I always
get beaten up for it?
I didn't ask you
to fall from the tree.
Is that the issue?
If I hadn't fallen from the tree
they would have killed you.
You have no gratitude.
That's what I have
to tell you, too.
I loved her because you told me to.
Where is your gratitude now?
That doesn't make sense.
You brought us together.
- So what?
So you must make sure
that we don't break up.
But your father won't allow you
to do any of that.
He is adamant that no woman
should set foot in your house.
What kind of a father is he?
He should learn from my father.
My father died three days
after I was born.
But your father.. all he does
is make new promises every week.
There's only one way out
if you want to marry her.
You should change
your brothers' minds somehow.
You should convince them
to get married as well.
We need one brother on our side,
and I will take
care of the rest.
I will make sure that
they fall in love as well.
I can't marry at this age.
Are you crazy?
Brother.
You are not that old, Brother.
Men who are older than you
get married to young girls.
That's not what we meant.
- That's enough.
I don't care if I'm old or young.
I just don't wish to marry.
I set out to marry once.
I am not sad that
it never happened.
I never felt that
it was a disaster either.
But the disaster that followed it
I can never forget that.
When I hear of weddings, all I can
think of is our mother's corpse
and our father handcuffed
by the police.
I can't forget all that
and get married.
My intention was not to hurt you.
He doesn't want
to get married either, right?
I just want
our bloodline to go forward.
We are not rare monkeys
to go extinct.
Get lost.
- But.. - Get lost.
How dare you ask me that?
Who are you to give me orders?
Speak up.
Why do I pray
to Lord Hanuman daily?
Why do I perform all these rituals?
To keep my mind
and body under control.
How can you ask an ardent Hanuman
believer to get married?
I will kill you!
- No, please don't hurt him.
No. Please leave him.
- I will kill him.
Who are you to interfere?
What is your problem?
I just came with him.
I'm his best friend.
- What?
Best friend.
- You bloody moron!
Before I lose my patience
take him away.
Just get lost!
Oh, God.
Please save me.
Here comes the other one.
Don't say anything.
Just make up something.
Stop there.
Why do you want us
to get married now?
I had pleaded the same thing
to them ten years back.
Do you know
what our dad said back then?
Why do you want to get married
when your brothers don't want to?
That day I gave up the thought
of ever getting married.
And I won't allow anyone
from our family to get married.
But, mister..
Come here.
You are spoiling him.
If I see you again with him,
I will break your legs.
Come here.
If I tell you something
will you do it? - What is it?
Give them some poison
and end this once and for all.
Let them go and die somewhere.
You won't get married until
your brothers don't agree.
They won't even allow
me to get married.
So let's part ways.
It's your life,
so deal with it.
Goodbye.
Hey.
I know that no one
will accept our relationship.
I'm ready to face the consequences.
My dad always used to tell me
to do what's right for me.
I think I'm doing the right thing.
Ramabhadran, listen to me..
- You have no idea
about our upbringing
and how we lived till date.
My mom passed away
when I was five years old.
Since then, there has been
no other woman in my life
other than my mom.
Now you have
come into my life.
I can't live without you.
I'm ready to face anything for you.
Will you stand by me?
Will you come with me and spend
the rest of your life with me?
I will always be there for you
and I won't hesitate
to come with you.
Are you happy?
Don't worry.
Everything is okay.
Hello. It's been a while.
How are you?
Come here.
- What?
Come here.
- Yes.
Smart girl!
How did you woo him?
Now you have proved your mettle.
Will he obey you?
I want him to chop
his father's head off.
What?
Yes.
Okay.
Now I'll tell you what to do.
Come.
Ramabhadran.
Ramabhadran, you have been saved.
You can love whoever you want.
You can marry
the girl of your choice.
No one will ever stop you.
When we spoke about marriage,
who got the most aggressive?
It was your brother
Swaminathan, right?
What's the matter?
What did your brother tell you
about his weekly journey?
He went to present offerings
at Thiruvannamalai temple.
Bullshit!
He goes to visit his wife.
What?
- Yes.
He is already married.
He has been married
for the last seven years.
He has a family there.
Are you talking about
my brother Swaminathan?
He pretends to be naive.
But he is a crook.
He goes to Thiruvalla
to meet his wife and kids.
His wife's name is Kochammini,
who is a teacher there.
Mayin Kutty,
are you speaking the truth?
You think I'm lying, right?
I am here with the evidence.
This is your sister-in-law.
She is a teacher.
Now with this,
we will plan something big.
We will teach them all a lesson.
For the first time in your life you
have done something worth admiring.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Excuse me.
Do you know a school teacher who
lives here by the name Kochammini?
A school teacher?
- Yes.
There is a lady who
lives here by that name
but she is not a school teacher.
Is her husband's name Swaminathan?
- No.
It's Ramanathan.
- Ramanathan? - Yes. - Damn!
We have got the wrong person.
- Wait.
Please look at this, mister.
Is this Ramanathan?
Yes. That's him. - What?
- Yes.
So, isn't this Kochammini?
- Yes, that's her.
But she is not a school teacher.
She is a dance teacher.
Who is there?
Sister-in-law!
- What?
Sister-in-law!
- Oh, no..
Get up!
Hey! Get up!
This is Ramabhadran..
Ramabhadran?
Your Ramabhadran, Sister-in-law.
- Damn!
Who is your Sister-in-law?
Well,
aren't you Ramanathan's wife?
I am E. K. Ramanathan's wife.
The very same..
I am the brother
of the man who lives here
with the false name
E. K. Ramanathan.
Where are the kids, Sister-in-law?
Kids!
Your uncle is here!
Kids!
Oh, God. I didn't realise
that he had so many kids.
Kids. I am your uncle.
Kids..
Your uncle is here. Kids. Why
don't you address me as your uncle?
Damn! They are students who
have come here to learn dance.
I think this is his.
- My dear.
Why don't you address
me as your uncle?
Oh, no. Give me back my child.
Get out of here.
Sister-in-law.
- I am no one's sister-in-law.
You better leave.
We need not hide
anything anymore.
Swaminathan has told
everything to Mr. Anjooran.
I don't know anyone named Anjooran.
I am not Swaminathan's wife.
Please leave.
Such nuisances.
- Ma'am..
I think we should
tell her the truth.
Do we have to?
I don't know how she would react.
We have to tell her.
What if he won't be able
to see his family again?
Hush!
She will hear us.
What is wrong?
It's nothing.
- No, something is wrong.
It's nothing. - What's wrong?
What has happened to him?
Just tell me!
- Tell her..
Please forgive us,
Sister-in-law.
He had asked us not
to inform anything.
However, we are saying
this since we are helpless.
Yesterday, brother met
with an accident.
What?
He had requested your presence
when he regained consciousness.
Oh, no!
My God!
I want to see him right now.
Please don't leave.
I am coming, too.
Let's go, dear.
- Ma'am..
Where are you doing?
- I'm making it look realistic.
Don't overdo it.
This is your problem.
- It worked. - Yes, it did.
It worked.
- Swaminathan. - Swaminathan.
Please wait, sir.
You are Swaminathan,
aren't you?
Yes.
What?
How do you know that?
Don't you know that
my name is Ramanathan?
I am aware. However,
they didn't agree to it.
Who are they?
- Brother.
Brother? - Yes.
- Who's brother?
Your brother.
He was with a friend.
And where are they now?
- There is nothing to worry.
I have led them straight
to your place.
Oh, have you?
- Yes.
I will kill you now.
You pig!
- Why are you pissed at me?
Do you want me to hug you?
I will deal with you
once I am back.
Oh, my God!
Enough with that.
Let's go.
Dear, you are all right.
You are not in danger.
What more danger
can I be in now, Kochammini?
Didn't you fall prey to them?
Haven't you managed
to put me in trouble?
You sinners!
You will suffer for this!
He is fine.
Then why are you cursing us?
Shouldn't you be happy about it?
Shut up, dog.
Do you seek happiness
by trying to destroy my family?
We won't let you live
happily all by yourself.
Let's go, Mayin Kutty.
Let's leave now so that we can
bring dad here at the earliest.
Let me see if this is applicable
for me as well. - Wait.
I am not going to let you
leave this place.
Kochammini,
hold them back..
Brother-in-law. - Don't.
- We will leave at any cost.
Just listen to me.
- No.
You may explain everything to dad.
I am asking you not to leave.
What do you want?
A marriage, isn't it?
I can make it happen.
- No.
Get lost. - Ramabhadran.
- Shut up.
What did you just say?
- What did I say?
About the marriage.
I shall make it happen for you.
- Not mine!
Oh!
I shall make it happen for you.
I promise.
Will you break
your promise later on?
If you don't trust my words..
Look.
Hurry..
I promise on my two kids
that I will make it
happen as per your wish.
I am in love with a girl.
- Isn't that obvious?
Tell me who the girl is?
- She is someone whom we know.
She is from Anappara.
Yes, it's Malu,
the daughter of Parasu.
Oh, God!
- You have given me your word..
No! I haven't given you shit.
Let it all get erased..
Kochammini,
get the kids back inside.
I can't play with
their tiny heads.
Ramabhadran, find someone
else to get this done.
This won't happen!
- But..
Forget it, Mayin Kutty.
The sooner we leave,
the sooner we can bring dad.
Why do you have
to bring dad into this?
Why don't you give me
some time to breathe?
Didn't you find anybody
else to fall in love with?
I want to know whether you
will support me or not.
Am I not doing that?
But I am warning you.
The fact that
I am a married man
is something that should
always remain a secret
between you, me and this fool!
If they do..
- Will that be a problem?
I will thrash you. - Please come.
- What happened?
We are in trouble.
- What?
I realise that the two
of you would come into terms.
I accidently informed
Preman about his marriage.
How could you? He would have
informed dad by now.
Oh, my God!
If you are right
from now on, I will
only have three sons.
I will kill and bury
Swaminathan in my courtyard.
And if you are lying
then again,
I will only have three sons.
I will kill and
bury you instead.
Bad luck follows me wherever I go.
Please hurry up, Kochammini.
Premachandran will be here
with father and brother.
I am coming. - Where is the one
who went to arrange the car?
Did he get hit by the car?
Please go and check.
We won't escape unless
the transportation is arranged.
He will be here soon.
Get the luggage. - Okay.
Why are you carrying this around?
- Oh, that's right.
I am trembling with fear.
What about you?
How can you be so weak?
Do you want me to thrash you? Do
you expect me to laugh right now?
This is all because of you.
Wait and watch
for the day when I kill you.
Aren't you done?
- Yes.
If we don't leave soon,
we will be dead for sure.
The car is here.
What is this?
Some sweets.
- Sweets, my foot!
Oh, no. Have you lost it?
- Your father has lost it.
She is packing sweets when
I am trembling with fear.
Oh, Lord.
Let's get back inside..
What?
This car looks familiar.
Who is here?
Oh, God!
Take a reverse..
Park it to the side.
Oh, Lord.
Kochammini, kids?
May I help you?
I don't recognise you.
I see.
Please don't misunderstand me.
We were about to go somewhere.
I asked because I believe in omens.
We haven't met before, have we?
What is your name? - Do you
want me to mention my name?
Why are you clenching
your jaws for that?
There he does it again.
If your name is so difficult
to pronounce, don't say it.
I only asked since
I couldn't recognise you.
You haven't recognised
me, have you?
Don't you recognise father and me?
I have understood that he is the
father and that you are his son.
I don't understand why you are
here screaming your lungs out.
Idiot!
Have you understood
what that was for?
To make you understand
that you are Swaminathan.
I am not Swaminathan.
Aren't you?
- No.
Is that so?
- Didn't I tell you that I am not?
Then why don't you slap me back?
Do it!
Slap me back
if I am not your father.
Slap me back.
Do it if I am not your father.
The only reason
why I haven't slapped him
is because I'm considerate
of my dead father.
If you don't take him
with you right now
I wouldn't care that he is an old
man. I will have to slap you both.
Oh, God,
I am losing my control.
Balaraman..
Balaraman.
- Yes, Dad.
You must find out and
inform me where Swaminathan
used to go all this while,
the reason behind it
and whom he used to meet.
Also, from now on, he must
not step foot inside this house.
Okay, Dad.
Even if he does come by,
he must not enter this house
unless he meets me.
Is that understood? - Yes, Dad.
Dad.
- Yes.
Why did you want to see us?
Well, do you feel
that I was ruining
your life all this while
by not letting you marry?
And that I was
destroying your life?
Why do you ask so?
Just answer the question.
Do you feel so?
- Not at all.
Neither do I, Dad.
- What about you?
No, Dad.
The two of us don't feel that way.
Isn't that right?
Yes.
You may only speak for yourself.
He will speak for himself.
I have never had such
thoughts until now.
Are you saying that
you can have them from now on?
No, Dad..
- Well, I do feel so.
I feel that I made a mistake by not
letting you all get married.
Long back when Premachandran
wanted to get married
I only had one condition
that Balaraman must
get married first.
And that he must decide.
Now I am going to let that go.
I will not force him
if he doesn't want to.
Let the others get married.
Hence, I am deciding
to get Swaminathan married.
What?
You will marry the woman I choose
for you. And I will decide when.
What?
Will he marry?
Will he get married again?
Let me see him do that.
- Ma'am.
It's not because
Swaminathan wants to. - Move.
He is being forced
into this marriage.
Right! Before that happens
he will see our corpses.
I will kill myself and the kids.
I didn't know that consoling you
would turn out to be a mistake.
Please listen to me.
- I don't have..
You have me, ma'am.
- Get lost!
Who needs you?
Ma'am, open the door!
Please don't do something stupid.
Ma'am!
Open the door!
Please listen to me!
If she does something stupid,
I will be held responsible.
Please don't. Please don't
hurt the kids. Listen to me.
Let's go.
Get inside.
Get inside.
- Don't close the door!
Open the door.
I will break it open if you don't!
I promise I will do so.
Oh, no!
Are you crazy?
You won't even let me
change my clothes.
Were you changing your attire?
I am very sorry.
Get lost!
Get down.
Come on.
Get down.
Oh, God.
Oh, God..
If I had such kids..
Swaminathan,
Sister-in-law is here.
Yes, she kills him at the end.
That's not it.
Sister-in-law is here.
Yes, Sister-in-law.
What.. What?
What are you doing?
Get outside.
I am not supposed to be outside.
I belong here.
These kids belong here.
Come here!
Kids who belong here?
These are my children.
And none of them are married.
Neither do they have kids.
I am Kochammini,
Swaminathan's wife.
Don't you dare speak
ill of my brother.
We will throw you out.
Bring me my husband.
Are you going to leave or not?
- Balaraman.
Swaminathan.
Tell him that I have died.
- Where are you going?
Never get scared no matter what.
Just say as we have practised.
Swaminathan.
- Oh..
What is it, Dad?
Why do you look so dull?
- I am fine.
You don't look good.
- I am good. - Is it?
Step aside.
- Here?
Is he your husband, Lady?
Obviously.
Tell them
that you are married to me
and that you can't marry again.
Tell them that
these kids are ours.
Oh, God!
What is she saying?
Who is she?
That is exactly
what I am asking.
Who is she?
- I don't know.
Don't you know?
- No.
You cheat.
Don't you know me?
Don't you know these children?
I know
you can't remember us now, as
you are going to get a new bride.
Do you have any proof for that?
Any ring or sign.
Anything of that sort?
Yes, I do.
- Where?
There is your sign.
Why don't you promise on them
that they are not yours
and that I am not your wife?
Why don't you call your
brother for more proof?
Bring him here.
Ramabhadran..
Did you notice that?
He hid behind the door.
He knows the truth.
Bring him here
and question him.
Ramabhadran..
Yes, Dad?
- Do you know her?
Please speak for me, dear.
Please tell them that
I am your sister-in-law
and they're your
niece and nephew.
Do you know her?
Oh, yes.
I know her.
I know her, Dad..
She often visits big manors
with her kids and creates trouble.
She was seen before
at several places as well.
She often does this.
She is in need of money.
- Oh, God!
We must take her to the police.
Get out! - No, Brother.
Why inform the police?
This is embarrassing. - It will
become worse if we call the police.
I shall handle this.
Leave..
Leave.
No, you sinners!
I won't leave!
I won't leave from here!
Shut it! How dare you bring
kids here and shame us!
Why don't you get rid of
them if you can't raise them?
I shall!
I shall do it right now!
Wait and watch. I shall
throw them inside your well.
Why do I need you, if your
father doesn't? Walk.
Let's go. - Dad..
- Just come.
Dad.. - Come here..
- Kochammini!
Come right here!
I will kill you! - Dad..
Let's go!
Won't you come?
Let's go! - Kochammini!
Give her to me.. - No..
Move, dear.
Kochammini.
What are you doing?
Aren't you my wife?
Aren't they our kids?
I was just trying
to save us from harm.
I don't care from now on!
I don't care about anything!
Let's go.
Let's go, kids.
Dad..
Dad, please forgive me.
You must forgive my family.
It's true that I was
cheating you all.
Please.. Please tell that
you have forgiven me.
Get lost, you rascal!
- Oh, no..
Am I supposed to forgive you?
You dog!
Stand up!
Get up!
What did you think of me?
I was playing along all this while
to find out about this.
Do you want me to forgive you?
- Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Please don't. - Leave me!.
- Please.. - Move her aside!
Oh, no.
Please don't.
Move!
- Leave me..
Please don't hit him.
Tell him not to.
Oh, God!
Let go of me!
Get up!
Please don't hit him anymore.
- Stand up! - Oh, no! Please don't.
Oh, God!
Hey!
What did you just do?
Nobody has ever dared to stop him.
Apologise.
Touch his feet and beg
for forgiveness, rascal. - Leave.
I didn't do anything wrong
for me to apologise.
What has he done wrong that
father has to beat him like this?
Is getting married
or having children a grave sin?
Kill me if you think so, too.
But I will not
allow this injustice.
Dad.
What are we to you?
Tell me, Dad.
Why are you feeding us?
So that you can beat us?
Or to beat others for you?
So what you want are ruffians
and not sons.
Street fighters who are ready
to kill and die!
Balaraman!
What are you looking at?
Kick these bastards out!
You are not Anjooran's
sons anymore!
Don't even dare to come
to my funeral!
Get out!
Out!
Finally, Anjooran's family
has been ruined.
Now, what is left, is his fall.
His children
will do that for him.
Fire them up!
Malu!
Come out, Malu.
Like I promised
I have abandoned everything
and I have come for you.
Now, come with me
as you promised me.
Who is it? - He is
Ramabhadran, Anjooran's son.
Go inside.
Get inside!
If you dare to take a step further
you will not go back alive.
I have already stepped in.
Now I don't care about anything.
Go someplace else
with your arrogance.
No.
Say no more.
I will speak.
Let him ask me what he wants.
Come, dear.
What do you think you are doing?
Do you think that
she will come with you?
Give it a try. Let's see
if she will come with you or not.
She will.
And I will take her with me.
Then, call her.
And take her along.
Tell him, dear.
Tell him that you did it
because I told you to do so.
Come on, Malu.
They won't do anything.
If you are willing,
I will take you with me.
I am telling you.
Malu, come with me.
Come with me, Malu!
Dear.
Dear!
- Leave.
Malu!
Hey!
You dog!
Leave her.
Leave her.
- No!
Don't leave him.
Please don't hurt him, Dad.
- Get lost!
Come here!
Leave me.
- I will kill you!
Hey!
- Leave me.
Leave her.
- I will kill you.
Take her inside.
Don't!
- Get inside.
Kill him!
Bhoomi, move! - Kill him!
- Brother!
What are you doing?
Move.
Listen to me, Brother!
You! - Kill him.
- Leave him!
Throw him out!
- No!
Don't!
Brother, it is a..
- Move aside.
If anyone dares
to mess with the Anjooran family
I will kill them all.
Get lost! Take him with you!
- Don't.
Or else you will have
to carry his corpse!
Go!
Take him with him!
I will be back again.
No matter where you hide her,
I will come to get her.
Are you happy?
Are you all satisfied now?
How dare you..
Tell me!
Will you go?
- I will.
I will go with Ramabhadran.
Will you?
Will you?
- Brother-in-law!
Listen to me.
- Leave me!
Dear.
- I said leave me.
No! - Move!
- Let him beat me. Let him kill me.
But I will go.
Move aside.
Let me teach her a lesson!
- Mother-in-law!
Move!
- Will you go?
Come on.
Move.
They will take care of it.
Move.
Brother, stop it!
Leave me.
Stop it. - Move.
- Go inside, Malu.
Hey, move aside.
- For what?
To beat her?
Do what you are
asked to do, rascal.
Get away!
- Hey!
Don't touch me.
- Hey!
What will you do if I touch?
What is this?
- Leave me, Brother.
Move. - It is not her
you should beat or restrain.
Restrain mother.
She is the reason for this.
Hemachandran, go inside.
Omana, take him inside.
Hey, take her inside.
{\an8}'Smoking is injurious to health.'
{\an8}There is nothing wrong
in what Veerabhadran did.
{\an8}Now what is the use in beating
or threatening her?
{\an8}Bring her to your side
as soon as possible.
{\an8}Enough with
your advice.
{\an8}Your advice is the reason
for all these.
{\an8}Blame me for it! - Your cunning
ideas are the reason behind this.
{\an8}My ideas are
not the problem.
{\an8}You turned it into this.
{\an8}I only told you to get him a girl.
I didn't say Malu.
{\an8}Enough!
{\an8}What has happened can't be erased.
{\an8}I will tell you what to do next.
{\an8}Find a groom for her
as soon as possible.
{\an8}Maximum 15 days.
{\an8}I want to marry her off by then.
{\an8}Where will I get a groom
within 15 days?
{\an8}We don't care.
{\an8}He should be of our family status.
{\an8}I don't have grooms in my custody.
Please understand that.
How about the one
in your custody?
Your son, Dr. Balakrishnan.
How about him?
Yes.
What is the problem?
I don't have a problem.
We have no issues either.
He has threatened
to do anything.
What if he..
He won't do anything.
Not just you,
he won't do anything to anyone.
I know what to do for it.
Don't you worry.
We will bring her
when the time comes.
Stop.
We owe each other something.
Let's finish it.
Are you asking it now?
Finish it.
Get lost.
Hey!
Hey.
Leave him.
Mr. Balaraman.
Someone people are thrashing
your brothers at the shore.
Hurry, or they will kill them.
Hey!
How dare you touch
Anjooran's sons!
Speak, you rascal!
Please don't kill me.
I will tell you.
Speak!
- Anappara Achamma told us to.
You sent bullies
to beat my brothers up.
There will be issues
between us brothers!
You must've felt happy.
If you dare to hurt
my brothers one more time
none of your sons will
survive another day.
And we wouldn't need
another person to do it.
I will do it myself.
Mark my words!
Do you get it, dogs?
Stop!
What did you say?
If we hurt your brothers
one more time
then won't my sons
survive another day?
We won't just be hurting your
brothers, we will destroy them.
Do you know what he is up to?
Do you know why he fought with
your father and left home?
To marry my granddaughter.
Now that you said all this.
I have nothing more
to think about.
I will make him marry
my granddaughter.
I will conduct the wedding
that Anjooran won't do for his son.
Go and inform your father.
Tell him to come stop it if he can.
Mother!
What are you saying?
With whose permission did you
decide to give him my child?
Why are we here if you
are making all the decisions?
Do you think I
will let it happen?
Our child will get married
the way we have decided.
Then why did you that to him?
That is my plan.
If I hadn't said that
all our plans might have failed.
Just wait and watch.
They will kill
each other for us.
Should I bring
his dead or alive?
I will do as you wish.
Everything got better just
when we expected war.
It is your luck.
What is it?
- Get inside the jeep.
Why?
- Get in.
Catch it.
Say that I took him home.
I am not coming home.
Then where to?
- Nowhere.
I was kicked out.
Now what?
I am telling you.
Get inside the jeep.
I won't come even if father
calls, let alone you.
So, won't you come?
Do you want a bride
from Anappara, right?
I will kill you!
Throw him in, Premachandran.
Get in.
Get in!
Dad is coming!
Hey!
Why are they running?
- Move.
Move aside.
Run! They are right behind us.
- Stop there.
No. Premachandran, no.
- Move. - God!
Premachandran, no.
- Move.
Move.
I won't let you.
Bloody dog!
- God!
Move aside!
Stop there.
Please don't..
God!
Stop right there.
Please listen to me.
Move!
- Please listen.
You won't, right?
Don't hit me, Brother.
- What if I do?
I said don't hit me.
Don't hit me!
Hey!
Move..
Move aside..
Hey!
I will kill him.
Mr. Balaraman..
No.
Ramabhadran!
Mr. Balaraman.
Brother!
- I will kill him!
Mr. Balaraman.
- Move!
Stop there.
- Brother, no.
Let him kill me. - No.
- Leave me.
Come here. - No.
- I said, come here.
Let go of him!
Leave me.
- What are you doing, Balaraman?
Leave me.
- He is your brother.
He is not my brother anymore.
Leave me!
- He is not Anjooran's son.
Let go of him!
Brother!
- Let me go!
Let him kill me!
- Don't, Brother! Let him go!
Anjooran, my foot!
Where is his pride now?
If the fate of Anjooran's
sons is to die
like a street-dweller,
go ahead.
Damn!
"Will the stormy sea"
"become calm and silent?"
"In a faraway place"
"rose a tide of pain."
"Will the stormy sea"
"become calm and silent?"
"Did the clouds of sorrow"
"pour down as rain?"
"Did tears become ember"
"and burden the soul?"
"Even in tears I search"
"what I long for."
"On unknown"
"kind shores of dreams."
"Rose a tide of pain."
"Will the stormy sea"
"become calm and silent?"
"The moon faded with its light"
"to bid farewell to my dreams."
"Did you forget the hardship"
"that you endured?"
"My soul longs"
"to see your smile."
"Did every cloud"
"slowly cloak the sky?"
"Did it start to rain?"
"Will the stormy sea"
"become calm and silent?"
"become calm and silent?"
Do you know what
you have to do now?
You must go to him
and ask his help to conduct
the wedding.
Didn't he ruin
our child's marriage?
He must attend her wedding.
And he must guard it like a dog.
Isn't he the great Anjooran?
Anjooran will give everything
to someone in need.
You should go and ask his help.
He will be ready to kill his son
if you ask him now.
Stop there.
Why did you come here?
We are not here
to fight, Balaraman.
Did you come here
to fix an alliance?
Get lost.
I have heard that Anjooran helps
the people in need.
Do you want help?
- Stop it.
Let them come inside.
Please forgive us, Lord.
Please forget everything
and forgive us.
Your son has asked help
from my mother
to get him married
to my daughter.
My mother wants to defeat you.
She has planned to
get her married
to your son in order
to defeat you.
But we want Malu to get married
to the groom we've chosen for her.
If he and our mom, try to hinder
the wedding, we might harm him.
We request you to forgive us
if anything happens to him.
No.
You don't need to do anything.
I will do it.
You want her to get married
to the groom of your choice,
right?
I will be there
to make it happen.
Dad.
Balaraman.
I will not give up in this
fight against Ramabhadran.
Anjooran doesn't lose.
What happened to your dad's
self-respect, revenge and pride?
The great Anjooran!
He is going to guard his rivals
wedding to defeat his son.
What is he,
a security officer?
I will slap you.
- Don't be angry now, Swaminathan.
Is there a particular time
to get angry?
Write down that time
somewhere and give it to me.
I will kick you.
Don't make me vicious
when I am tired.
Ramabhadran.
- Excuse me.
She is coming back.
- He doesn't allow his sons
to get married. Then why is he
helping his rivals with it?
Why are you shouting,
Kochammini?
I will shout. I am upset
about his behaviour.
We don't have time
for more sorrows.
We already have enough.
I will let you know
when I can share new sorrows.
She is trouble.
Ramabhadran.
You will remain a bachelor
if you listen to him.
We should go there.
Even if Hades is going to attend
the wedding, we will stop it
and you should marry the girl.
Who is this?
Is that father-in-law?
My sons have joined hands
with your dad.
I don't want to defeat
your dad or my sons.
My granddaughter
is important to me.
I am here to talk
to you for her.
I will be sending her
to the marriage hall
with the hopes that you
will come and marry her.
Don't cheat her.
Did you believe whatever
my mother just said?
Do you think she will
let you marry Malu?
My mom wants you to fight
with your dad.
Not to get you both married.
My mother has arranged
this new alliance for her.
Do you know that?
My mother just asked you
to marry Malu tomorrow.
But this same woman sent my
brothers to your dad for help.
It's a trap. His brothers
have sent him here to trick you.
We know what exactly
has to be done.
Get lost.
- Ramabhadran.
Get lost.
Get lost, rascal.
Get away, swine.
Ramabhadran.
I didn't come here
because I care for you.
There is a girl in my house
who is worried about you.
She told me to come here.
She doesn't want you
to fight with your dad.
She will kill herself,
if you do that.
Move aside.
Why did you stop? You could
have killed me instead.
You could have won easily.
Why are you going there
and attending
their marriage function?
Are you doing this to hurt me?
I don't want to marry her
and make you upset.
I will not go there.
Please don't go there, Dad.
Hey.
Move aside.
No.
Please trust me.
They are cheating you.
Please don't support
them, brothers.
Stop talking and run him over.
Please listen to me.
I will not go there.
Please don't go there.
Don't support them.
You shouldn't lose in front
of them. You're important to me.
Dad is important for us, too.
We will go there
and support them.
Don't try to stop us.
I am ready to kill
you for my dad.
I am Anjooran's son.
Don't forget that.
I am also Anjooran's son.
Mark my words.
I will come there
and stop the wedding.
I'm not doing this for myself.
But for my dad.
Let's see.
- Let's see.
Yes.
Let's see.
Listen to me.
Be there at the marriage
hall tomorrow.
Ramabhadran will come there.
He will marry you.
No.
I will not come.
I don't want to get married
by creating chaos.
I don't want my marriage
to turn out like my mom's.
I am trying to put
an end to this fight.
You should get married tomorrow
if you want to stop the rivalry
between these two families.
You should get married to him in
front of your grandma
and Anjooran.
But if you still want this
rivalry to continue this way
then you may do as you wish.
Come in.
This is the bride.
She is my wife
and this is my brother's wife.
Go inside.
Both of you should stand here.
Don't leave this place.
Keep an eye on that door.
Both of you should stand here.
Don't go anywhere.
Come in..
Mom,
who invited you here?
You are not allowed
to come inside.
Get lost!
Who are you to stop me?
It's my granddaughter's wedding.
I will go inside.
Don't try to show off here.
There is no point talking
about Malu now.
Mr. Anjooran is helping us
with this marriage.
We will not allow his
enemies inside this hall.
Sir,
it's true that she is our mom
but now,
you're more important to us.
Your enemies are our enemies.
Isn't it?
Yes..
Heard that?
Did you hear them?
If you still wish to attend this
wedding,
ask his permission first.
Apologise to him.
Don't worry. He will give you
anything that you ask for.
You have been living with this
revenge for a long time.
Get rid of the grudge
and apologise.
Don't think that we will let you
inside without
apologising to him.
Make it fast. Decide whether you
want to apologise or go back home.
It's time for the wedding.
Stop there.
Balaraman, stop it.
I can forgive her for everything
if the tears she is shedding
right now is genuine.
Take her inside.
Moreover, it's not her
that I want to defeat.
It's him.
Ramabhadran.
Oh, no.
Who are you to make
our mom apologise to him?
We will kill you..
- Leave..
Leave me.
Leave me, Brother.
This is why I call you idiots.
If I wouldn't have stopped her,
they would have done it instead.
Things would have went
from bad to worse.
Now mom can attend Malu's
wedding and watch them fight.
That's her dream.
Do you think mom cried
because of Anjooran?
That is also one of her tricks.
Anjooran is the one who got fooled.
Not her.
They will suspect us
if they see us talking.
Let's go there.
Come on.
Come on.
Ramabhadran.
Get the vessels out..
Mayin Kutty, get the vessels out..
Get the vessels out.
- Don't shout.
Stop there..
Stop there.
Why are you bringing this now?
We took these for rent.
Don't you want it back?
Balaraman, search them.
No.
Balaraman.
I will do it. They might come
in different attires.
Move aside.
I will search everyone.
This is fine.
Go inside.
Next one.
This is also fine.
Go inside..
Next!
Sorry for being late.
- Okay.
This is not them.
Come here.
It's okay.
Everything is fine.
We got saved because of this.
Then keep it on your head forever.
Will you both stay quiet?
Don't shout.
Run.
Run away with the vessels.
Don't make noise.
It's me, Veerabhadran.
It's me.
Don't panic..
Ramabhadran.
- I am Swaminathan.
Oh, no.
- Ramabhadran.
Where were you? You should
have got here a bit early.
Bring the groom here.
Let's start our plan.
Please keep it down.
- Keep it here.
Don't make noise.
- Keep silence.
Change the clothes.
Make it fast.
Where are you going with the Dhoti?
Why are you taking this inside?
- To use this if needed.
I will kick you.
Oh, no.
What happened?
- What happened?
Nothing..
Please go inside.
Come in..
- I will get you.
Since the day I've met you, things
has been going downhill for me.
Doctor.
Hello.
- Come with me.
What happened?
- Come with me. I will tell you.
What happened?
Is there a problem?
There is no problem till now.
But there is a
possibility of it.
Don't worry, Doctor.
I called you here for something.
Do you want some?
- What?
I am talking about drinks.
- I don't want it.
We are also drunk.
It will be good at this time.
I will send my brother.
He will take care of everything.
I don't want it now.
You should say no in the beginning.
But have it once he forces you.
Please go inside now.
Go inside.
Where were you?
- Nothing, I just..
What is it?
- There is a problem.
Oh, no. Where?
- Don't worry. It's not serious.
What is it?
Our groom has an upset stomach
due to tension.
An upset stomach?
- He needs to use the toilet.
Is this the time
for doing such things?
He will be in trouble
if he doesn't go.
Please take him to the toilet.
Why can't you help him?
- I just went to the room.
It's filled with women.
Please ask them to move out.
The groom is a bit shy.
But you should take care of it. Go.
This is bad.
Come with me.
- Not now.
You will be fine.
Let's get rid of your tension.
I am absolutely fine.
- What happened?
Nothing.
Come on.
I will take care of everything.
- No.
Don't worry. Come on..
- No.
Oh, no.
There are lots of women here.
It's fine. Everyone does it.
I will ask them to go out.
Come on.
Please go outside.
Go out.
Hurry up.
Get inside.
Everything has been kept ready.
I will wait for you outside.
Why are you not coming inside?
- For what?
To give me company.
- Oh, no.
Why are you acting so strange?
Go inside.
What is the matter?
Hey, what is it?
Stop giggling and go there.
Are you waiting for the groom
outside the room?
How can you behave like this?
It's time already.
People are getting agitated.
We still have time.
Let him take his time.
Your brother and relatives
are asking me about the groom.
Please talk to them.
I will bring the groom with me.
Go now.
Balan, what is this?
The auspicious time is nearing.
What is taking you so long?
Come on out.
Where is he?
He's heavy.
Rest him there.
The glasses.
Good.
- Go and stand guard.
Don't you go now!
We have work to do.
Come.
- Shall we take him?
Stand behind me.
Good boy!
Did you lose something?
Go on now..
Where is the groom?
- Don't worry. He is right here.
Where is he?
- His stomach is upset.
What?
Oh!
Cover your face with this.
Come..
Good Lord!
Splendid!
Brother, he is not here yet.
Will he refrain out of fear?
No. He will come.
That too right on time.
The wedding and murder
will happen simultaneously.
It's time..
Start the music.
Get the nuptial chain..
Take the nuptial chain!
There he is!
You..
- What?
Get down!
- Brother!
Wait! We don't have to do it.
- Step aside!
Let Anjooran do it. Let him
and his children
kill each other.
We shall not intervene.
- Move..
Make way!
- Step aside!
Move!
Move!
Move!
What kind of a man are you?
Didn't you see
that your son is here?
Kill him..
Balaraman!
- Don't!
No need to come.
I'm not marrying her.
Did you see her true
colours now, Dad?
Don't you realise that she
orchestrated all of this?
We must kill each other.
That was her sole intention.
I went through this trouble
to make you realise it.
It's not to defeat you
or to marry her.
Forgive me, Malu.
Once my father ruined
a wedding of yours.
And now, I am doing it.
I can't marry you by letting
my father down.
And I don't want a life
by breaking your heart.
Stop!
Tie that chain around her neck.
Tie the nuptial chain!
No. I won't do it unless
father asks me to.
He says so.
I can hear his thoughts.
Do it if you are Anjooran's son!
Make way!
Start the music.
Start it.
Stop it..
I told you to keep playing!
Stop and I'll kill you! Mind it!
Start the music!
Tie the chain!
Tie it!
Really? Will you do so?
- She snatched it!
Bring it here. Give it.
- Leave it. - Give it.
No, I won't.
- Give it.
Take it. - Leave it.
Don't you do
it. - Ramabhadran!
Give it to him!
- You!
I'll kill you! - Take it!
- Ramabhadran!
Leave me!
Let go!
Move!
- I'm here, Veerabhadran!
Swaminathan!
Catch!
Are you here from the beach?
There we go.
Swaminathan!
- Take this!
Let go! - Give it! - Why do you
lift me? I don't have it. - What?
I won't give it.
You will have to kill me for it.
Where are you going?
- I won't give..
Let go!
- You! - Let go! Give it!
Preman!
Stop!
Who wants to ruin this?
Come!
I will show you!
Here!
Take this!
Ramabhadran!
Ramabhadran!
Take it and go!
Tie it!
Quick!
I got this.
Do you have any more
vengeance left in you?
You must at least have
some goodness in your heart
to thank him for forgetting
all your differences
and coming here to conduct
this wedding
in place of your late husband.
Dad, if what I have done
is arrogant or stupid
kindly forgive me.
We shall live far away from you.
No need for all that.
Seek his blessings.
Go and seek your father's
blessings!
Come, Kochammini.
Come.
Dad, forgive us, too.
Sir, we are home.
Come, my children.
Come.
