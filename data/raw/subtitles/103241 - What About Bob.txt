I feel good, I feel great,
I feel wonderful
I feel good, I feel great,
I feel wonderful
I feel good, I feel great,
I feel wonderful
I feel good, I feel great,
I feel wonderful
Good morning Gill!
I said... good morning Gill.
I gotta go to work
See ya.
Wish me luck Gill.
Doctor, it's your wife on the phone.
Thank you Claire.
Fay, are we sitting down?
My publisher thinks it's gonna happen
Yeah, he thinks Good Morning
America is coming up to lake
Winnipesaukee next week to interview me.
It's a tremendous shot
in the arm for my book.
Ye.. No! It's very unusual...
Well I think they did visit doctor
Rooth's house once but, other than...
Hold on a second, honey.
Yes.
Excuse me doctor, but there's a doctor
Carswell Fensterwald on the phone.
Thank you.
Fay, I have to go, there's
another collegue on the phone.
Boy, they sure do come out of
the woodwork when you're famous
Good bye there.
Carswell!
Leo! Long time no see, huh?
You've got a... big book out!
Things are really clickin', huh?
That's the way I planned it!
Listen, Leo! I'm uh quitting my practice
for a while, I'm leaving town.
And I have one patient
I'd like to refer to you.
Exactly what kind of a case is it
Carswell? He's not psychotic, is he?
N-No! No... nothing like that!
Listen, his name is Bob Wiley
He pays early, he comes on time and uh...
he just  needs someone brilliant, Leo,
you know, I know that you don't like flattery but,
if there's anyone I know who can
win the Nobel Prize, it's you.
Well... I suppose I could find an
hour for him sometime after Labor Day
Okay! I'll work him in for an interview
Hey Carswell, how come you're
quitting the business?
We're a dying breed Leo, good luck!
Free!
Claire, if a Bob Wiley calls,
schedule him for a short interview
right after I get back from my vacation
He's already called, Dr Marvin,
twice, he's your next appointment.
That's persistence.
I feel good, I feel great,
I feel wonderful
I feel good, I feel great,
I feel wonderful
I feel good, I feel great,
I feel wonderful
I feel good.
Can I help you sir?
Yes. Dr Marvin, Dr Leo Marvin?
2nd elevator, 44th floor.
Thank you.
Elevator?
- Bob... wwah...
- Bob Wiley?
Um, why don't you sit down?
It'll be a few minutes.
Dr Marvin, Bob Wiley.
Thank you.
Thank you for working me in.
Should I call you Dr Marvin or Leo?
Which ever you like.
- Call me Bob.
- Bob
Is that your family?
Yes.
Oh wait, let me guess,
I'm very good at this!
Uh, that's Harriet...
And then Ronny
Gretchen...
and Rita.
Eh wait, wait a second,
Cecilia,
Dorothy...
and this is Kenneth
And Bambi.
This is my son Sigmund
And my wife Fay
And my daughter Anna
And that's my sister Lily
Lily? That was close.
It's a beautiful family.
Thank you.
Have a seat.
Why don't I start? Hm?
The simplest way to put it,
I have problems.
I worry about diseases, so,
I have trouble touching things,
In public places it's almost impossible.
I have a real big problem moving.
Talk about... moving.
As long as I'm in my apartment, I'm ok.
But when I... when I go out, I get...
WEIRD !
Talk about weird.
Talk about weird.
Well, I get dizzy spells, nausea,
Cold sweats,
Hot Sweats,
feather(?) blisters,
difficulty breathing,
difficulty swallowing,
Bird vision, involuntary tremble
Dead hands, numb lips,
Finger nail sensitivity,
Pelvic discomfort,
So the real question is,
what is the crisis? Bob...
What is it that you are trully afraid of..
What if my heart stops beating?
What if... I'm looking for
a bathroom, I can't find it...
and... my bladder explodes...
Have you ever heard of Tourette's syndrom?
Involuntarily shouting profanity...
It's exceptionally rare...
SHUT IT SON OF A BITCH!
BASTARD! DOUCHEBAG! TWAT!
NUMBNUTS! DICKHEAD! BITCH!
Why exactly are you doing this?
If I fake it, then I don't have it!
You know it's the same
with the cardiac arrest.
Are you married?
I'm divorced.
Would you like to talk about that?
There are two types of
people in this world.
Those who like Neil Diamond
and those who don't.
My ex-wife loves him.
I see,
So, what you're saying is that
even though you are an almost paralyzed,
multi-phobic personality that
is in a constant state of panic,
your wife did not
leave you, you left her,
because she liked Neil Diamond
No, you're saying that maybe...
maybe I didn't leave her
because she likes Neil Diamond,
but maybe... maybe she left me?
Yes.
Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow...
Dr Marvin,
You can help me, for the
first time in my life,
I feel like there's hope!
I feel like I can be somebody.
Bob, there's an old saying,
that the best
psychiatrist in the world,
is the one right inside of you.
Yeah...
I can help you, yes.
Thank you.
Bob, there is a ground-breaking
new book, that has just come out, uh!
Now, I have writed this book,
of course it applies to you, but,
I'm sure that you can see
when you see the title,
exactly how it could help.
Baby Steps?
It means setting small
reasonable goals for yourself
one day at a time.
On tiny step at a time
Baby steps
For instance, um...
when you leave this office,
don't think about
everything you have to do
in order to get out of the building,
just think to what you must do to
get out of this room,
and when you get to the hall,
deal with that hall,
and so...
You see?
Baby steps!
Baby steps.
Oh boy!
Baby steps, baby steps,
baby steps through the office,
baby steps out the door,
it works!
it works!
All I have to do...
is take one little step at a time,
and I can do anything!
Baby step throughout the office,
Baby step throughout the office.
That should give you a lot to
digest while I'm on vacation...
v-vacation?
Oh, certainly my secretary told you,
as of this afternoon I'm
taking my family on vacation
until Labor Day.
That's a month!
What if I need you?
What if I need to talk?
Well my associate, Dr Armand,
will be happy to talk...
and Bob, I'll be back!
Just read Baby Steps.
Baby steps, out of the office.
Very good.
Baby steps to the hall.
Very good Bob, keep going!
That's it!
Bye!
I'll see you in a month!
Baby steps to the elevator,
baby steps to the elevator.
July 31st, Bob Wiley,

Multiphobic personality,
characterized by acute
separation anxiety,
and extreme need for family connections,
bill the usual rate for the
interview and $29.95 for the book
It's your publisher...

Baby step onto the elevator,
Baby steps into the elevator,
I'm in the elevator,
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Main Manhattan Exchange,
Yes this is Bob Wiley,
I'm a patient of Dr Marvin's,
I have to speak with him
right away, it's urgent...
I'm sorry Mr Wiley,
but Dr Marvin's out...
It's Bob and you are?
Betty
Betty, hi!
Bob, Dr Marvin's out of town,
and Dr Armand is taking his calls,
I know that Betty,
It's just that there's been some confusion,
I was supposed to call Dr Marvin,
but I've lost his phone number.
Bob, I can't give out that number.
I know that Betty,
But you could call
him on the other line,
and tell him that I'm on hold on
the other line, could you please?
Thanks Betty please?
Phone, daddy...
Thank you Anna.
Thank you sweetheart.
Yes.
Dr Marvin, this is
Betty at your exchange,
I'm sorry to disturb you but,
I have a Bob Wiley on the line
who says you want to talk to him
Betty, you know better than that!
Dr Armand is covering for me
I told him that Doctor,
but he said he lost your number
and that it was urgent.
All right, put him through
Go ahead Bob.
This is Dr Marvin,
what's the problem Bob?
Dr Marvin, how's the weather up there?
What?
How's your brood?
You all getting a chance to relax?
Bob, uh...
I thought I made it clear to you,
that I'm on vacation.
Well I know,
but I'm just worse than
usual this time, really bad.
Bob, if this is really an emergency,
go to the emergency room,
and if it isn't, call Dr Armand,
I'm sure he can help you.
Well I'd just feel
so much better
if I knew where you were!
It's my disvenue(?), right?
Bob...
Well, can't we just talk?
Yes we can,
in my office after Labor Day!
After you're back from Fire Island, huh?
Goodbye Bob.
Well, you want to keep me all to yourself ?
Goodbye Bob!
Is this a fake hang up?
It's a fake hang up!
I'll get the phone, I'll get the phone.
Hello?
Doctor, It's Betty again,
I have an urgent call from your sister
My sister?
Put her through.
Go ahead.
It's not you, it's me.
Lily? What's wrong?
Dr Marvin, please don't
be angry, this is Bob.
I know that I shouldn't be calling...
Bob, the doctor-patient
relationship is based
on trust, when you call me
pretenting to be my sister,
I can't trust you anymore.
Go to the ER, please, do
not call me here again!
No no no...
That was not smart!
That was not smart!
Who is it?
Detective Robertson, from homicide, I
have some questions about a Bob Wiley.
What?
That was the Bob who
kept calling Dr Marvin.
That was that Bob who kept calling.
Unfortunately, Bob committed
suicide about 15 minutes ago.
Oh my God!
That's terrible!
Very sad, it should... it should
never have happened,
it was a very sweet guy,
uh, but he did leave a note however
he mentioned a Betty
She's Betty.
I'm Betty.
Oh!
So you're Betty.
Oh, Bob called here trying
to reach his psychiatrist
Oh, well where is he?
I'll have to ask him some questions too.
Uh, uh, Dr Marvin is on
vacation in New Hampshire.
New Hampshire!
I can get him on the phone for you.
Good.
No! Don't!
If I really need to, I can have
someone from NHPD drop by.
Err, but!
What if I wanted to write him a letter... would
you have a mailing adress of some kind up there ?
Oh, sure!
That's um, PO BOX 14
Lake Winnipesaukee
Which is spelled?
W.I.N.N.I.P.E.S.A.U.K.E.E.
Thank you very much ladies!
I'm crazy about you!
Especially you, Betty.
Hello?
What?
All right.
Thank you for calling Betty.
It was the service.
That patient, the one who called before,
he committed suicide.
Oh Leo, how horrible.
Oh well, that's not gonna
spoil our vacation.
Baby Steps get on the bus
Baby Steps get on the bus
Baby Steps...
This is the last bus
to Winnipesaukee, Bob.
Yes I know Wing, thank you.
Baby Steps for the bus..
Baby Steps...
You think you can do it today, Bob?
We have a busy schedule to keep.
Baby Steps in the bus...
Baby Steps on the aisle...
Baby Steps on the aisle...
Baby Steps...
And seat in the seat.
Hello!
I'm Bob,
would you knock me out please?
Just hit me in the face...
Do we have enough to feed
the entire film crew here?
Honey, we have enough to
feed the entire network!
Oh great! Another vacation
that's not a vacation.
Why do I have to dress
up for this stupid show?
What do you mean, you've already
tried on everything you own!
I have not!
All right! Oh My Gosh!
It's probably going to be
a short interview anyway,
just me and the family and
my book.
Easy fellow, we're almost there!
False alarm.
Dr Marvin!
Dr Leo Marvin!
Doctor!
Marvin!
Thank you!
- Goodbye Doctor!
- Thanks again!
Honey, is someone calling you?
Right over there!
Oh my God!
Doctor!
Leo!
Leo, do you know that man?
Get in the car!
Come on! Hurry!
Hurry, Hurry!
Doctor Marvin!
Ohhhhh I really appreciate this!
Everyone in the car! Come on!
Doctor Marvin!
Is this a bad time?
The fam!
- Who's that?
- I don't know...
What are you doing here?
I thought you were dead!
Oh no, they told you,
well I felt(?) a little bit,
but don't be mad at me...
Bob, your behaviour is
completely inappropriate.
You're angry...
No, no! I don't get angry.
Well you're upset...
I don't get upset!
Well then, let's have a little talk...
Bob, I do not see patients
on vacation, ever!
How many ways can I make that clear?
Now, what I'd like you to do
is to get on this bus,
and go back to New York.
I can't! I'm totally paralyzed!
I'm all locked up!
You got yourself here!
Barely...
Well getting back will be therapeutic!
But can't we just have a little talk?
Bob! You are testing my patience!
Come on! I've come so far!
- Bob! - Baby Steps...
- I'm doing the work!
I'm baby stepping, I'm not a slacker!
Check it out! Look at me!
I'm in really bad shape !
Come on please!
Gimme, Gimme, Gimme,
I need, I need, I need!
Ok Ok Ok! All right! All right!
All right, it's 2 o'clock
go to the bus station,
buy yourself a ticket home
and then wait for me
in that coffee shop.
You'll meet me?
I'll call you!
In 2 hours.
Oh my God! You're the greatest!
No no no... you just
have to promise me that
you will buy your ticket and go home!
Absolutely!
I'm gonna do it, do it right now!
All right, I'll call you at 4 o'clock.
You couldn't possibly
make it 3:30, could you?
Bob!
4, 4 okay!
Exactly 4 o'clock! It's better. Okay
Thank you Dr M.!
Baby Step to 4 o'clock...
Baby Step to 4 o'clock...
Baby Step to 4 o'clock...
Oh my Gosh!
I need a bowl!
- What?
- a bowl, he's been locked in for abour 8 hours!
he's about to scream.
he's furious.
Sorry, Gill. Little negligence on my part,
Here you go, come on, aim tight fellow
Jeronimoohh, it was a long ride,
wasn't it? I know, I need a stretch...
Hey No ! No ! No !
I'm expecting a phone call!
Thank you.
Thanks a lot! Thanks everybody,
I really appreciate it!
Also, uh, 
If I...
lose consciousness or black out or
something explodes,
would you tell Dr Marvin when he calls
- ... that I was here?
- Doctor Leo Marvin?
Do you know him?
Yeah!
He bought our dream house!
Worked a lifetime to save for a down-payment
He swooped down with his bag full of money,
and grabbed it up from under us!
Son of a bitch.
She never says that!
Stay as far away from him as possible!
Well, that'll be easy !
He won't see me, that's why
I'm waiting for the phone call.
He won't see you?
Well,
we'll show you where he lives!
You will?
The son of a bitch!
She never says that!
Siggy, I have the whole house to fix,
all the art to hang,
I have no idea what I'm gonna
wear on the TV show,
but I've stopped everything in
order to teach you how to dive.
Cause it is as important
for me to see you dive
as it is for me to appear
on Good Morning America.
Oh man! This is really pressure.
Come on take off your robe!
Why are you always wearing black?
What is it with you and
this death fixation?
Maybe I'm in mourning for my lost childhood.
All right, come on, come on, turn around !
Close to the edge, that's it!
Remember what we learned last year. Okay!
One, Two, Three, Spring!
Now bend up the knees, up your
waist, hands out, stiff as a board.
One, Two ,Three...
Spring!
One
Two
Three
Spring
Spring
Summerfall(?), time to go dad!
I don't understand...
why won't you dive?
With all the horror that's going on in
the world, what difference does it make?
Hi Lily! I'm just calling to
remind you about Leo's surprise party.
Thursday night, 7 o'clock, Ok?
Well, it'll be after his
interview so he should be rela-
oh, wait a minute.
Oh! Yes, of course I'm thrilled Lily,
the last person they interviewed
on vacation was Doctor Rooth.
Here he comes. Thursday night 7
o'clock, don't forget ok? Bye bye
He didn't dive?
No...
Oh  now come on sweetheart,
he's just a little afraid of it!
Have patience.
No, it's not like I make him jump
out of an airplane or anything...
When i was growing up,
I thought diving was fun!
I thought you were born grown up, daddy!
Yes, I'd like the number
to the Guttmans' coffee...
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry, don't be mad,
the Guttmans brought me
Thank you Mr and Mrs G.!
You're welcome Bobby!
Hello Dr Marvin!
The house looks good!
Burn in hell, Dr Marvin !
Bob, we agreed that I would call you!
Your coming here is
unbelievably inappropriate!
Dad, can I uh...
Oh, I'm sorry
Hi! You're Anna, aren't you?
I saw your picture, I'm Bob!
Hi bob!
Nice to meet you Bob!
Hi! I'm Bob!
I'm Fay.
Oh Mrs M., you are even...
prettier than your picture!
and younger!
Thank you!
Fay, Anna. Would you please excuse us?
I think Bob and I have
something to talk about.
Really?
You think so too?
Let's take a walk.
-Oh Bob, could I take your fish?
- Oh yes, thank you!
He's already been ??? otherwise.
This is a great place!
No wonder the Guttmans want it!
I'm sorry about barging in here like this!
That's all right! I understand.
The problems don't go
away just because I do.
Bob, I'd like you to...
take a long look around you
What is everything you
see here have in common?
Vacation, Bob!
Vacation.
Now,
I can't, Bob, at this time,
give you the kind of therapy
and attencion you need
to solve all your problems
and you know why.
You're on vacation!
Exactly!
What I can do,
is, this.
Duuh, don't give me pills,
I already have plenty!
Uh uh uh! This is not pills!
Read it!
It says,
Take a vacation...
from my problems.
I'm giving you persmission
to take a vacation, Bob!
Not a vacation from your work,
and not a vacation from daily life,
but a vacation...
from my problems.
Exactly!
Now I want you to get on that bus
and go back to New York.
But!
Every single time a problem arises,
I want you to take that prescription out
and follow it to the
letter, doctor's orders.
I'll see you in New York, in my office,
in one month!
This is incredible!
This is astounding!
For the first time
since Ethelyn, I feel free!
You have given me a great gift, doctor!
The gift of life!
You're a great man!
I knew coming up here was
the right thing to do.
It feels right because you are here
and it feels right
because you're leaving.
- Have a great vacation!
- You too, Bob!
A vacation from my problems!
You bet I will!
There you go!
Baby Steps!
Is everything all right honey?
- Yes, everything is perfectly fine!
- He seemed pleasant enough.
Mhm, when he's controlled
I got so excited I forgot
to bring you with me!
Gill?
Oh! The fish!
Well, that's a very nice likeness of you.
Thank you very much. It's very nice...
Of everyone actually.
Bye Bob!
Bye bye Bob!
Bye bye!
You've got to be Sigmund?
Yes, this is Sigmund
and this is Bob
and Bob was just leaving.
Hi!
Oh, this is Gill, my fish, Sigmund.
Did you get him out of the lake ?
No, he's a city fish.
Cool.
Be he loved it up here!
You father is the most
incredible psychiatrist,
I certainly hope you appreciate him.
Have a great vacation, family!
Me too.
Good Bye Bob!
Bye Bob!
Bye!
Well, he's different.
Or...
This!
I told you, I like the rifle,
I think it's a symbol of virility.
Now can I eat breakfast? I'm supposed
to go sailing on George Stark's boat.
Wait, wait, wait!
Fay, I need your opinion, rifle or bust?
I think both looks are wonderful, sweetie!
Oooh Fay!
You know I can't live
with that kind of answer!
I need, I need feedback!
Good morning, Doctor Marvin!
No! These aren't for you!
They're for Fay!
For yesterday,
for your hospitality
to Gill and me. I didn't say thank you.
I thought about what you said!
Take a vacation from my problems,
and I did!
But you're back!
No, I'm not!
You're not?
No I'm not!
I'm on vacation!
This isn't an appointment,
I'm dropping by!
This is my first time over the lake!
This is my first time...
anywhere!
Little anxious cause I haven't
figured how to get food yet,
but I'm staying at the Guttmans', when I
told them what you said, they insisted.
No! No no no!
So, I know we can't work, but let's
get the friendship thing going.
See you later!
It seems like he's
staying, doesn't it ?
Hey, Paper Boy! This was on your porch.
Thank you!
Family conference!
Family conference!
All right. Now, I don't want any of you
letting Bob into this house.
Why?
- Why?? - Sweet heart, aren't you
over-reacting just a little bit?
Good we we are all in agreeement,
Family conference is over.
A vacation from my problems
There's nobody here.
Nothing to fear.
There's nobody here.
I'm completely alone
I'm all by myself.
There's nobody here!
Hi Bob!
- Hi!
- Where are you going?
Just going to town.
- Buy some kleenex.
- Well you want a ride?
I'd love one.
Do a lot of people use this car?
Just us.
So, what's it like being the
daughter of a brilliant analyst?
who's sleeping in the next bedroom at
night when you need him? Is it great?
No... It's not great.
I have problems, the
same as anyone else.
The same as you.
You're afraid your bladder will explode?
What other ones are the same?
Like what? Like what?
Well like analyzing everything
to death, to see what
I'm feeling is normal.
Yes, I have that! Yeah.
Do you freeze up and, turn into wood
when you're around a good looking guy
and you don't even know
if he likes you or not?
Well, not a guy, but yes I free-
You know what, I treat people
as if they were telephones,
If I meet somebody who I don't think likes me, I say to myself
Bob, this one's just temporarily out of order.
You know, don't break the connection,
just hang up and try again!
Does it work?
It seems to be!
I'm on vacation at lake Winnipesaukee!
All right?
Do you want to come sailing with me
and my friend George's boat ?
ohhh no...
That's ok, you don't have to.
No, I'd love to!
It sounds great!
I've never been on a boat, and
I don't think I can handle it!
It just makes my lips
numb to think about it.
But if you find us a good
sailor, and the craft is sea-worthy
Yes, I would go sailing!
Yeah, let's go sailing!
I've no other plans!
I'm sailing!
I'm sailing!
I'm sailing!
I'm sailing!
I'm sailiiiiing!
This is child abuse!
If you drop me, I'll prosecute!
I'm not gonna let go
until you're ready ok?
Trust me.
Put your hans out like I showed you.
I'm not ready. You hear me? I'm not
ready! Don't drop me, I'm not ready !
Dr Marvin! I'm sailing!
Oh, Siggy!
Murderer!
Hitler!
- Hi dad!
- I sail!
Anna!
Anna, come here please!
- Dad
- Anna, I'd like to speak to you please.
Dr Marvin, Dr Marvin, guess what!
I sail!
I'm a sailor! I sail!
- I'd like to talk to my daughter alone.
- What is this, a break through?
Do you think that I'm a sailor?
I sail?
I sail now?
Keep sailing Bob!
Out on a boat on the lake?
Way far away from the dock?
Into the wind, with
the sky and everything?
I thought I told you to
stay away from Bob Wiley.
Daddy, I was with my friends.
- Where are we going?
- Home!
- What about the car?
- Leave it, it's been a long time since I've had a talk with my daughter!
Oh daddy, not here!
Anna, Anna, Anna!
Anna...
- I know you won't listen to your
father, but you will always listen to me.
- So I'm asking you not to see Bob Wiley.
- Daddy, I am just...
- I can't hear you!
- Where are you Anna?
- I'm just having fun with my friends!
- And Bob Wiley.
- Yes and Bob Wiley!
- Bob Wiley is your father's patient.
- Bob Wiley is a very sensitive person!
- Your father's sensitive.
- Bob listens to people!
- You father listens to people!
- Except when he's up
here in lake Winnipesaukee.
He IS FUN!
You father's... kinda fun!?
I'm Fay Marvin.
Doctor Marvin's wife.
And I'm very happy
to be on your program.
And these are our children,
Anna and Siggy.
I'm a failure.
What?
Going on national television tomorrow
as an expert in human behaviour,
and in the space of the last hour,
both of my children have
told me that they hate me.
Come on, you know they don't mean it.
Anna accused me of being insensitive.
No... no. What she actually said was,
I was insensitive,
and I didn't listen,
and I wasn't any fun,
and that Bob Wiley was.
Give me...
Some time...
To blow the man down...
Notice anything different about me?
- No. - Do you
sail? - No.
Well I just picked it up, hehe
What am I going to pick up next?
- Try diving.
- All right! Diving!
I know a great teacher.
My dad, he just dropped me in
the water, without warning me first.
I mean, I nearly drowned!
My whole life flashed before my eyes.
Well you're lucky you're only 12!
That's still grim. I mean what
is it with him and diving?
What's the big deal?
Well... he...
Wow...
He probably just wants you
to beat it, that's all.
You know he probably just wants you to
dive, because you're afraid of diving.
Didn't I tell you?
I sailed on my first try.
I just let the boat do the
work, that was my secret.
But, with diving, what is the...
what is the thing ?
- What's the trick?
- I don't know.
It's supposed to be easy.
Well, can you give me a handle on it?
Thanks.
- Careful, oh careful!
- Let's go to the edge.
Go to the Edge!
Come on, toes off, close to the edge.
Don't worry.
- Come on!
- Let's call this the edge, right here, this is the edge.
Ok, then step off this edge.
Now walk up to our edge.
Okay
Bend your knees, bend your knees! Very good.
Bend your knees!
- and be stiff as a board.
- I am stiff as a board.
- Now lean forward...
- Just a, just a second, don't rush it.
Just a second, it's my first dive.
Well I can't see what you're doing,
why don't you get in front?
Hey careful, hold it, hold it, wait, wait
- Come up, come up!
- Hold it, hold it!
- Hold my shirt, I'll show you what's to do.
- I got it.
- Okay, and bend my knees.
Bend your knees.
Lean forward.
Stiff as a board.
Honey!
Come here, look.
Come here, come here!
I don't want to have to see this! No, please!
- One
- No !
- Two
- Don't do it! Please!
- Three
Yes!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Bravo! Hurray!
Hey Bob! Thank you, thank you!
I'll take it from here!
??? Wonderful!
Did you see me dive, dad?
Did you see me dive?
I go!
Thank you! Excellent!
Here watch this! I can do it again!
I'll take it from here!
Did you see it? Here,
I'm gonna do it again!
Oh my God! Bob!
WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?
I HAD EVERY RIGHT TO BUY THIS HOUSE!
Am I gonna die?
- Am I gonna die?
- No!
Fay...
Look everybody, I'm not wrong often
but when I am, I admit it.
I mean it.
I would like you all
to accept my apology.
- But what about Bob?
- What about Bob?
Yeah, dad, don't you think
you should apologize to Bob ?
I will not apologize to Bob.
Why not?
All right.
I'll apologize to Bob.
And now I'd like him to go.
Leo, why are you so hostile to the poor(?) man?
Because he's a patient!
Fay, don't you get it, he's a patient!
A patient! A patient!
- Mum, can we have Bob over for dinner?
- Dinner?
Yeah!
I don't want Bob for dinner, Fay!
Leo, it's for the kids.
I don't want Bob for dinner Fay...
I want to think about
my interview tomorrow!
I'm sorry Leo.
Right is right.
Fay, this is so scrumptuous!
- Is this hand-chocked?
Would you like some more chicken, Bob?
- Leo, do you want the breast?
- No no no, that's fine, eat up!
Nice bicuits, huh?
Yeah, great biscuits,
great corn, great potatoes!
You want some more salad, Bob?
Yeah, I think I do.
Could you get that tomato
off there please?
Sure.
Thank you.
This is delicious!
Will you STOP THAT, PLEASE?
Leo, I see salt and pepper,
is there a salt substitute?
MMMM, I'll get it!
And dont call me Leo.
But you said in your office
that I could call you Leo.
That was in my office.
In my home, I'd like
you to call me Dr Marvin.
He's just a little nervous
about his interview tomorrow.
Oh yeah! I heard about
your upcoming debut!
Congratulations Le... Dr Marvin!
Your book is gonna do a lot
of good for a lot of people!
I'm walking proof of that!
- Is this butter or margarine?
- Butter.
Dad?
Dad, are you okay?
- Dad?
- Honey?
Don't panic, I know what to do!
Don't worry, hang on!
He's dying!
I'm doing the right thing!
Honey, I love you! Breath! 
Harder! Maybe with your knee more!
Hit him harder!
Jump higher!
Spit it out!
???
Spit again!
- Leo are you ok?
- Get him off me!
Bob, you saved him!
That was incredible!
I just never gave up hope!
We're singing in the rain...
just singing in the rain...
what a glorious feeling,
I'm happy again...
I walk through the kitchen...
With a bowl full of chicken...
And I put it in Leo, I mean
Dr Marvin's refrigerator...
Thank you.
I'm singing in the rain...
I don't like being a party poop,
but tomorrow's very important and...
we'd better call it a night.
I DON'T WANT TO BE RUDE, BUT MAYBE
IT'S TIME FOR BOB TO SING HIS WAY HOME!
Honey he can't walk home in this!
Did I say that? I'll drive him!
- Oh dad! The car is still at the marina!
- What?
You said to leave it, remember?
Well, it's gotta let up soon.
He can go home then.
Well what if it starts up again?
He can borrow my slicker!
- Leo...
- Shhh
- Leo...
- Shhh... I think it's letting up!
Leo, honey, it's 1
o'clock in the morning...
we can't just make that poor
fellow just sit here all night!
Let's just let him stay over...
FAY! Good Morning America
will be here at 7 o'clock!
You don't want them to find a severely disturbed patient
sleeping on one of my couches when they get here!?!
There's an extra bed in Siggy's room.
- Fay!
- Leo, you were very upset over Anna and Siggy
Well know here's your chance
to show what kind of guy
Leo Marvin really is...
Come on sweetie. Come on.
Bob, we'd love for you to spend the night.
That's a great idea!
Do you have a deck round pillow?
Sure, sure! Anna would you get
a pillow and some sheets for Bob?
Sure!
Siggy, would you get one of
you father's robes for Bob?
Yeah!
Are you sure I'm not imposing?
Oh no no no no! Not at all!
Okay...
Do you care which bed?
Well I prefer facing south-east.
This one.
Did you find a tooth brush?
Yes.
Fay, do you know where
my new tooth brush is?
Should be in the bathroom.
I know it should be in the bathroom
but it is not in the bathroom!
Leo, honey, just because you're
going on television tomorrow
this isn't giving you any
right being so snippy!
It is not that that is making me snippy!
- It's him!
- Him who?
Bob?
Yes! Bob!
Who else am I talking about?
- Quiet, he'll hear you!
- So what if he hears me? It's my house, isn't it?
Don't you get it? He faked suicide!
Well, wasn't that a cry for help?
What is the matter with all of you?
Don't you understand?
This man is crazy!
I mean, for all we
know, he could be a... a...
a... mass murderer!
Oh, come on Leo!
He's a sweet guy!
He's perfectly harmless!
Maybe a little neurotic, but
but not crazy.
Don't you realize that
everything he's done,
violates the doctor-patient relationship?
And now he's in there,
with our son!
Bob?
Yeah?
Are you afraid of death?
Yeah...
Me too...
There's no way out of it.
You're going. To die.
I'm going to die...
It's going to happen
What difference does
it make if it's tomorrow
or in... 80 years?
Much sooner in your case
Do you know how fast does time goes?
I was 6 like yesterday...
Me too.
I'm going to die!
You... are going to die.
What else is there to be afraid of?
Well, not diving anymore huh?
But uh...
Tourette's syndrom.
What's Tourette's syndrom?
What's Tourette's syndrom?
Oh, I'm very proud of it Mr Robson,
very encouraged by its success
I think the greatest challenge
to me aside from writing was...
- SHIT FOR BRAINS!
- BUTT-HEAD!
- DINGLEBERRY BUTT
- SNOT-FACE!
???
TURKEY TITS!
Open this door!
Sigmund! Sigmund, open
this door immediately!
I'm sorry dad.
Sorry.
What is going on around here?
Tourette's, dad.
Tourette's.
I'm sorry dad... Leo... Dr Marvin.
I don't want to hear another
pip out of this room!
People are trying to sleep around here!
I think it's just kids being kids!
Well tomorrow is the most
important day of my career!
We're sorry, we'll stop.
We just got carried away.
It will never happen again.
I want you out of here by 6:30,
do you understand me?
The camera crew is coming at
7, I want you out by 6:30!
Sure, would you like
something for sleep?
What?
I have Valium if you need it.
No! I don't need any Valium!
I want some peace and quiet!
Well, I'll be quiet.
I'll be peace.
Come on Bob.
Come on, here we go.
You know, we've just got to keep your father
until Good Morning America tomorrow
Bob gave me a great thing to
be afraid of instead of death.
That's nice sweetie.
That's very nice Bob.
- Good night, fellows!
- Good Night!
- Mrs M., could you leave the door open just a creak?
- Okey Dokey.
6 o'clock Bob, time to wake up,
come on, let's go!
Come on Bob! Get Up! Bob!
Come on Bob!
Bob, rise and shine! Come on!
BOB! COME ON BOB! GET UP!
BOB!

COCKADOOLOODOO!
DOH!
Honey, relax!
Baby stepping down the stairs!
Baby stepping down the stairs!
Success! is this a
beautiful morning or what ?

- I had the most incredible dream last night!
- Leave!
- Good Bye Mrs M. See you later!
- Bye bye Bob!
Bye Anna!
Bye Bob!
Good Bye rat dick suck nut!
Good bye door-pissing ???
Later testicle head bussom beaver!
Good Morning America's here!
Hi! I'm Marie Grady.
Lifestyle reporter with Good Morning America.
I'm a big fan, I watch your stuff all the time!
- I hope we're not too early?
- No no no!
- I'm Howie Catrell, the director. And this is our producer Lennie Burns.
- Nice to meet you.
- Well, may we come in?
- Eh! Oh sure! Absolutely
This is... this is our home and,
I was thinking of
something by the fire?
It's fireplace shot, fellows!
This is even nicer than the pictures.
Thank you.
Is um, this your family?
Yes, yes, yes it is.
Oh! Excuse me, I'm sorry,
this is my wife Fay,
And this is my daughter Anna,
And my son... emm
- Siggy?
- Siggy!
Oh! Hi! I'm Marie.
Hello Marie, I'm Bob.
Yes, this was Bob,
he's a patient, he lives down the road.
Dr Marvin, what a great idea!
A Baby Step right in action!
- What?
- Howie, Dr Marvin's gonna have a patient on with him.
Fine, Lenny listen up how we'll shoot this
fireplace. Let's set up over here and shoot.
- Oh! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute
- No problem Dr marvin,
We can still use the fireplace.
You on one side and Bob on the other.
I don't think it's such a good
idea to have a patient on with me.
- It is!
- It is?
Yeah dad! It's a great idea!
What better way to show
the effectiveness of your book,
than have a patient on with you!
I think it's a fireplace shot.
Can I speak to you outside
for just one second?
Thank you so much.
I worked very hard to get
where I am, you understand me?
- Schooling(?) alone, yes.
- I do not want you on the show with me, do you understand?
- I think I do.
- I'll make up some excuse.
Dr Marvin, Bob can we have
you in here for a minute please?
- I can't, Dr Marvin doesn't want...
- Eh eh eh! No! Get in there!
They're waiting for us!
Right this way.
In...
Three
Two
One
We're back and we're going now
to lifestyle reporter
Marie Grady and Lake
Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire
And Marie what is so special
about Lake Winnipesaukee?
Well Joan, among other things,
it's the summer home of Dr Leo Marvin.
Author of the newest sensation
in therapy, Baby Steps.
And with Dr Marvin is Bob Wiley
who is a patient and obviously a
big fan of Baby Steps therapy.
Good Morning Dr Marvin, Bob.
- Good Morning
- Good Morning
Now clearly, to come on
national television live
with a patient, shows a
remarkable amount of confidence
in your methods.
False alarm. Sorry.
Okay?
Good.
Now, Dr Marvin.
Exactly how does Baby Steps
work on someone like Bob?
Well Joan, I'm very proud of Baby Steps and
enormously gratified by its success,
I think the greatest challenge
aside from the writing,
is finding ways to make the ideas within it
accessible to laymen as well as to my colleagues.
Um, Bob, tell us your
impressions of Baby Steps.
Mushed potatoes and gravy, Marie!
I couldn't be happier about Baby Steps!
I was a total disaster
and now, because of this man
this morning I'm on TV in front of
millions and millions of people
I don't even think Dr
Marvin know what the heck's going on,
he can't believe what's going on.
I'm very excited!
You know it sounds like
a very intriguing process.
How long have you been
a patient of Dr Marvin?
3 or 4 days.
3 or 4 days??
Book is not really meant
to work that quickly!
It only worked that quickly with Boob.
Boob?
Bob.
You can call me Boob.
No, I don't want to call you Boob.
Even if you did as an accident.
No! I really don't
want to call him Boob,
the book isn't, you know, made to work that quick.
But it did work that way!
That's the miracle of, of
of Baby Steps.
It's not just this book.
It's this man.
It's the compassion.
It's the, it's the dignity,
it's the wisdom.
It's the horse sense,
of the guy.
That gets you
He actually had me stay here
last night in his jammies.
Using his tooth brush.
In his house.
And, I spent the day swimming and
sailing with his family.
Fay and Anna and Siggy, come here!
Here's the fam! The Marvins.
This is Fay and Anna and Siggy.
whom I went diving with testerday.
and Dr Marvin accidentally pushed me in,
You have a very nice family.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.
Marie, you are wise,
what do I say to someone
who has turned my whole life
forever and who is giving so much
of their time and their vacation
to make me better.
What I'd really like to do is put the
greatness of this man in perspective.
I think there's really only 3 names
Dr Albert Schweitzer,
Mother Tereza of Calcutta probably,
and Leo Marvin.
The book is Baby Steps,
the author is Dr Leo Marvin,
and we've been talking with Bob Wiley
Pretty impressive stuff, Bob!
Dr Marvin.
Back to you Joan.
Way to go Bobby!
That was wonderful Bob!
Thank you very much Marie.
Can we come back in a few months
and take a look at your progress?
Um, as long as it's ok with my doctor?
What? Oh!
Absolutely!
That's a very good idea!
Ok, great!
Come on dad! We're taking a picture!
- Come on!
- Come on Dr Marvin!
- Come on!
- No...
You go ahead...
All right.
- How long do you plan on staying?
- Just till Labor Day and then we all
  go back to New York City.
Ok... Big smiles everybody!
Cheeeeeeeeeeese!
Ok, bye bye.
Good Bye Marie.
Bye bye.
It was nice talking to you!
They're so nice!
You were great Bob! You really were!
You were incredible! I mean
dad choked, you saved him!
Here is the one who made it happen!
- Oh sweetie!
- Dr Leo Marvin!
Get out...
No we won't get out! You deserve it!
I mean, GET OUT!
GET OUT!!
Is it something I said?
You ruined my life!
You've ruined my career!
You've ruined my book!
You've turned a perfectly peaceful
house into an insame asylum!
Get out!!
- Daddy!
- What's got into you?
It was a disaster, Fay!
No it wasn't, you were
wonderful sweetie!
You were fine dad!
Why d'you need to kick
Bob out of the house?
You think he's gone?
He's not gone! That's the whole point!
He's never gone!!
Is this some radical new therapy?
YOU SEE??
We can't be expected to
understand him, he's so far above us!
We're like ropes on a Goodyear blimp.
Are you all right?
I want to apologize to you
for that terrible outburst,
I'm trully sorry.
Call it a case of show-business nerves.
Oh, we can all certainly
understand that!
A lot of people freeze on TV, dad!
Thank you.
Bob...
How would you feel about you
and me having a little talk?
Just me and you?
I think I'd like to spend
a little time with you,
pay you back for all the
time you spent with me.
What do you say? Do you like
going for a little ride?
Do I??
- This is so sweet!
- It's really nice dad!
Look how happy he is!
Try to be home by 7!
Where are we going?
Intensive psychotherapy.
Wow!
Okay!
Some free associations from my infancy...
A beach ball
A dog
A frog
A lock
A poodle
A noodle
A doodle
Dr Marvin to see Dr Tomsky.
Dr Leo Marvin.
Err, main building Doctor,
they're expecting you.
Hey, you're Bob Wiley, aren't you?
- Yeah!
- I saw you on TV, you were great!
Huh!
Hello Leo! Long time no see!
Sorry, I missed your show this morning.
Well this is the friend
you called about!
Bob Wiley! I would like you
to meet your new pal, Dr Tomsky.
Hello Bob.
New Pal? What's wrong with my old pal?
Would you show Mr Wiley
to his room please?
Oh no, wait a second, doctor, doctor?
You're coming with me, aren't you?
Fellows! I have compulsions, my
bladder is feeling funny!
Really appreciate you're
helping me out on this, Catherine.
I can only hold him for 24 hours,
Leo, without staff corroboration.
Not worried about that in the least!
I'm sure your entire staff will corroborate!
Thank you, Thank you
very much Catherine!
- You're welcome!
- Thank you.
Ahh, you see Bob,
I will not be defeated!
I won't negociate and I
won't compromise with defeat!
Cigarrette, Bob?
Oh! Sorry!
Didn't realize you were
in a straight-jacket!
Honey!
Catherine Tomsky's on the phone.
Hello?
What?
No!
No!!
- Son of a bitch!
- Where's Bob?
- Son of a bitch!!
- Where's Bob?
Honey! Where's Bob?
What about Bob?
What about Bob?
WHAT ABOUT BOB?
Male or a female? It's a female!
What, d'you think I'm weird or something?
But, it reminds me of my
favorite poem, which is...
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
I'm a schizophrenic,
and so am I.
So the psychiatrist says...
That's not the joke here!
Wait a second...
He draws a picture of a tree and he says,
what d'you think of that one?
He says sex, all right, he draws
a picture of a car, a house, sex, sex, sex
Then the doctor says, you know
you're obsessed with sex!
And the patient says, what? you're
the one drawing all the dirty pictures!
I'm giving you back
your admitting form Leo,
to save you any embarassment.
- EMBARASSMENT?
- Yeah!
Catherine! You have been duped by a
textbook narcissist, a brilliant sociopath!
Brilliant enough to
dupe my entire staff?
I doubt that!
Now, it's perfectly natural for a
patient to bond with his analyst!
If you want to be rid of him, just
tell him you won't treat him anymore!
Catherine, that's easy for you to say!
The man is human crazy-glue!
You should've never let him
sleep in your pajamas Leo.
I can't believe that I'm hearing this!
Relax Leo!
I'm relaxed!!
Take a vacation!
I'm on vacation!!
Maybe you should check
in here for a few days...
get a handle on things.
It was an interesting morning, fruitful,
but it lacked the intensity that
you and I generate together.
the sparks that we get one on one
we just got to figure out a way
to work around your schedule,
Could we work afternoons?
2 to 4?
3 to 5?
Monday, Wednesday, Friday,
Saturday and Sunday?
Are you saying you'd rather work mornings?
Get out of awehjsa!!!
It's a combustible
relationship, isn't it?
Is it just you and me, or
it it you and everybody?
What is this, isolation therapy?
Excuse me, officer?
Can you make sure he's home by 7?
Hey! Didn't I see that guy on TV?
Oh Damn! Son of a Bitch!
I'm home!
Fay?
We're all here sweetie!
SURPRISE!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR MARVIN!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!
Dad, what happened?
Dad?
Honey, you're a mess!
Are you all right?
Oh yeah yeah, I just...
had a little car trouble!
Ohhh on your birthday...
Happy birthday Leo!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY LEO!
Sweetie, we have a great
big surprise for you!
You sister Lily is here from Chicago!
Happy birthday Leo!
Lily!!
We're all here for you Dr M.
This is your night!
DON'T TOUCH MY SISTER!
I've never seen him like this, Phil...
He's been under a lot of stress Fay,
his book, his interview which,
frankly, didn't go so well...
- And his birthday
- Exactly.
Phil, do you think Leo was surprised?
Oh I think so!
- How is he?
- I'm leaving a prescription for Prozac.
Excuse me Phil, but with these particular
symptoms, is Prozac the right choice?
You think Prozac is a mistake?
For this kind of manic episode, I would think that
Liberrine might be a more effective management tool.
You could be right, I'll
rewrite the prescription.
Bob, why you think Leo would
act to you like that?
I don't know! He's been tensed today,
But don't worry, no matter how long it takes, I'm
gonna stay on and help the family. I'll just be the daddy!
You are such a good friend!
Leo's lucky to have you!
Thank you sweetie! Oh, no problem!
It's been a real pleasure!
Keep me posted!
Okay!
- Bye Lily!
- Good Bye
Bye Lily!
This is so hard Bob, but...
Listen, we're not defending
Leo's recent behavior in any way so...
please don't take this personally.
Oh no...
We've been thinking that however irrational the
reasons, Leo's just so upset with you right now that,
we just think it'd be best if
you're not here when he wakes up.
Please, that's not the way I want it!
Me neither.
Or me.
You want me to go?
I'm sorry.
Really?
Goodbye.
Later!
- Good bye Bob!
- Bye Anna!
- Take care of yourself!
- Okay, and you take care of Leo!
Just temporarly disconnected,
that's all!
You know, I've got to tell you!
I've had the greatest
vacation with yall!
No! Too messy!
No! Not painful enough!
Yeees!
He's not at the dock!
He's not downstairs!
Let's get in the car! Come on!
Maybe he went for a walk!
Hello!
Oh God!
Doctor Marvin!
Doctor!
Doctor Leo Marvin!
Dr Marvin!
Dr Marvin!!
Hello Bob!
What are you doing with a rifle?
Get back! Get back!
- What are you doing?
- Quick! quick!
Stand there!
Dad! Where are you?
There goes the fam?
You'll be very quiet!
And do exactly as I say!
Turn around!
now move
- Where we up to?
- Death therapy, Bob!
- It's a guranteed cure.
- Wow!
Should I put my hands up?
Yes that's good! Do that!
- Err, which way?
- To the left!
To the left, yes!
It's so right that you and I've
come together, isn't it Dr Marvin?
I know it was meant to be!
- You think so Bob?
- Yes!
Because it's time!
And I'm ready!
With Dr Carswell I wasn't ready...
And Dr Rosinger and Tchesky.
It wasn't time!
I was certainly not ready
for Malestine or Miller. Or Hill!
But with you! Finally, I'm ready!
The only significant difference
between those other guys and me Bob...
is that I'm gonna kill ya!
But if you shoot me, then
our therapy will be over!
I'm not gonna shoot you Bob! I
don't think I can shoot anybody!
I am gonna blow you up!
This is called black powder, Bob!
One teaspoon of this stuff can blow up a treestump.
There we go!
And how much is this?
20 pounds worth!
You understand, don't you?
There's no other solution!
You won't go away!
- I will!
- No, you won't!
You're just saying you will,
But then, after I don't kill
you, you'll show up again.
And you'll do something else to make everyone in my life
think you are wonderful and I'm a schmock
but I'm not a schmock Bob!
And I'm not gonna let you breeze into town and take my family
away from me, just because you're crazy enough to be fun!
You'll take care of Gill for me?
Yeah don't worry! I'll feed
him till he's big and fat!
And then I'll eat him, Bob!
You sure aren't convincing Dr M.!
This is tricky!
What?? Oh! It's terrible news, Fay!
Well he did try to commit suicide once
before, maybe we should have seen this coming.
More fish anyone?
I'm all tied up...
And tied up...
Yeah! That's it! You're saying
I'm all tied up inside!
Okay!
I'm all tied up inside and...
and these ??? bombs mean that...
If I don't...
Untie myself inside
the emotional knots...
I'm gonna explode!
Yeah!
Oh it's so... simple!
Yet so brilliant !
Okay, Doctor M.!
I get it!
Baby Step.

Daddy you're all right?
I'm fine! I'm fine!
I'm fine! Really, thank you
for asking! I'm fine now!
Bob's gone.
- We know sweetie...
- You do?
How?
I didn't hear it go off!
It's Bob!
Bob, just please...
Dr Leo is a genius!
Your death therapy cured me,
you're a genius!
What are you doing here?
You cured me doctor!
The bags I put around your neck Bob,
Where are they?
In the House?!
Why?
Sweetie... our house?
Oups!
Burn burn burn!
You think he can hear us talk to him?
Can we talk to him?
I don't know if it will help him. Try it.
Come on sweetie.
Leo!
Sweetie!
Leo!
Can. You. Hear. Me?
Daddy, it's me Anna!
Leo, it's me, Lily, your sister!
We don't care about the house!
Come back to us!
The worst is over!
Yeah dad! How much worse can it get?
Do you, Bob Wiley, take Lily Marvin, to be your lawful wedded
wife, to love, honor and cherish till death do you part?
I do.
Do you, Lily Marvin, take Bob Wiley to be your lawful wedded
husband, to love, honor and cherish till death do you part?
I do!
If anyone here knows any reason why these two
should not be joined together in holy matrimony,
Speak now or forever hold your peace.
Then by the power vested in me...
by the state of New York,
I pronounce you man and wife.
NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
Dad's Back! Daddy!
Honey!
