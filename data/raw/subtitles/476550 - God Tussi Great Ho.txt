People call me the creator and the almighty God. 
I was happy when I created a human being. 
I created all those things in the world for a human being to be happy. 
But humans are not happy in.. 
..this beautiful world created by me. 
He feels that he has something less.. 
..than some other human being. 
Before the time and beyond the fate neither anybody.. 
..has got anything nor will he get it. 
Many people are angry with me without understanding this logic. 
Here is a person who.. 
..is the most upset with me. 
Welcome to the first episode of the show 'Mano Ya Na Mano'.. 
..with your host, Arun Prajapati. 
In this programme, we'll show you some.. 
..mind-boggling things, which will surely amaze you. 
So today, in our first episode, we have with us.. 
..Mr. Loha Singh! 
Yes, this is Mr. Loha Singh. The one who pulled.. 
..a motorcycle with his teeth when he was ten years old. 
A bus when he was fifteen and a train when twenty. 
And today, he'll prevent a helicopter from flying.. 
..by just using his teeth. 
The Guinness record for this feat is 40 seconds. 
And he'll hold it for 20 seconds more.. 
..which makes it one whole minute! 
And your time starts now! 
Come on, Loha Singh! 
I know you can do it. Come on, Loha Singh! 
Glory to Loha Singh! Stop him if you can! 
Come on! You can do it! 
Hey! What happened? 
I broke my teeth. - You've just broken two, there are thirty left. 
Try once more. - No! It's paining badly. 
It's a question of my prestige! The whole world is laughing at me. 
This is my first episode, pal. Try again once! - No! I can't do it. 
You pulled this and that.. Shall I pull a hard one on your face! 
Don't touch the phone! All the sponsors and media persons.. 
..are calling up to abuse us. 
Just lift the receiver and keep it back. 
Sir, where do you think from? - From where that AP doesn't think. 
Where's he? I won't spare him. AP! 
Hello, sir. - Please come! Welcome! 
Please come, Mr. Arun Prajapati. AP, the great! 
Please sit on my chair. 
Sir. I'm sorry, sir. But why do you say so? 
I'm saying the right thing. 
Because I'll be kicked off that chair because of you. 
Isn't it, secretary? - Sir, I'm not able to understand anything. 
Sir, the one who brushes his teeth with margosa twigs.. 
..everyday, Loha Singh, if he breaks his teeth in my show.. 
..then what's my fault in this? 
It's not your fault. It's my fault that I gave you the show. 
Believe it or not, if you continue working like this.. 
..then I'll have to shut down my channel. 
The end! Isn't it, secretary? - No, sir! 
No, sir! I won't ever let this happen. 
For the next show, I have a guy called Puchi Kapoor. 
Puchi Kapoor can smooch his girlfriend for 48 hours.. 
..non-stop in the marketplace. Sir.. - Enough! Enough! 
Out.. Get out! 
Get out! 
AP got scolding again. 
Don't know, when this poor guy was born? - Poor guy. 
Here is the host of 'Mano ya Na mano.' 
He is not a host, but a ghost. 
What? What are you grinning for? 
I'll knock out all your 40 teeth with one punch. 
You'll break his teeth?! But he has only 32 of them. 
The other eight are yours.. 
..because I knew that you'd interfere. 
But pal, it won't be so much fun breaking our teeth.. 
..as it was breaking Loha Singh's teeth. 
Hi. 
Listen. Forget all this.. let's go to the corner.. 
I have to talk to somebody. - To whom? 
The one who turned my show into a flop. 
Laugh! Laugh! When the whole world is laughing.. 
..then why isn't the creator doing so? 
Loha Singh, the one who pulled a bus, a train.. 
..a plane.. his teeth never pained then. 
But he had to break his teeth only in my show. 
Early in the morning, my mother checked,. 
..the predictions in the newspaper and told me.. 
..that today will be a great day. But you must've read it too. 
And how could you tolerate me having a good day. 
Am I the only one in this world whom you trouble.. 
..or is there someone else too? 
What has happened to him? - He suddenly complained of chest pain.. 
..and then fell unconscious. 
When? - An hour ago. 
An hour.. Don't worry, everything will be fine. 
Take him to the ICU, hurry! 
Don't worry, ok? Everything will be fine. 
Look, madam, you are very lucky. 
Heart specialist Dr. Khurana is present here. Don't worry. 
No use. He's dead. 
Doctor, how's my father? - A major heart attack. 
Don't worry. Deposit Rs. 1 lakh immediately. 
What have you brought for lunch today? 
Ask your wife to cook lunch for you at times. 
He's been cooking up stories for his wife all these years. 
65000! 
Thank you. 
You're the first doctor to give medicines to the dead. 
Not just medicines, we also give him.. 
..injections worth Rs.60000. - Is it? Go and return it. 
It's been long now. We've even had our meal. What to do now? 
Nothing. Have some dessert and then give her the news. 
Doctor, how's my father? 
We tried our best but we couldn't save him. 
Have courage. 
Go and clear the bills while I prepare the death certificate. 
Ok? Come, doctor. 
You've already paid Rs.1 lakh. Just pay Rs. 40000 more. 
All the details are in the bill. You can check it. 
Here's your father's death certificate. 
Very good! Very good! 
Here's his death certificate. 
This man had died at 10 am in Sanjivani hospital. 
Huh?! - What?! 
I had just brought his corpse to you. - Corpse?! 
Yes. I'm Alia Kapoor from Channel one. 
This was a sting operation of ours. 
What? Sting? - There! - Hey, move the camera. 
That is my team. 
Madam, please don't do this to us. - Hey back off! 
back off! - Hey, close the camera! - Don't go. Somebody, stop them! 
Oh God, camera! - Look, how can you do like this. This is cheating. 
Look... - Hey, shut down the camera. 
Our reporter Alia Kapoor.. - Fantastic! 
Fantastic! - Corruption takes place in hospitals too. 
Keep the receiver back on the phone. 
Yes, sir. - Let the calls come in. Let the sponsors praise us. 
But boss, I'm not able to understand anything. 
I knew it the very day I appointed Alia.. 
..that she'll make the TRP of my channel shoot up. 
Welcome Alia! - Here she comes. 
Welcome, Alia the great. - Sting operation. - Alia.. 
Stop! Beware! 
You rabbit! And you, the tortoise too! 
I'll bash you with this bouquet. 
Only AP will congratulate Alia. 
Only AP! Who? - AP! AP! A.. 
Congratulations, Alia. 
Thanks, AP. 
You love flowers, don't you? 
And I like you too. - Me too. 
I love you. - I love you too. 
Congratulations, Alia. Give her a big hand. 
You've done a wonderful job. - Thank you, sir. 
I can't believe that.. 
..you've done such a fantastic job. - Really! Really! - What say? 
What say? - Thanks. 
Sir, all the credit goes to you. - Brilliant job, Alia. 
I can't believe it. 
I hope no one is watching. - The next job should be even more wonderful. 
Ok! Everybody back to work. - 100%, sir. 
Back to work everybody. - Bye. 
Yes. - Yes. 
Good job, madam. - Thank you, Murari. 
Just thank you won't do. Tell the boss to get me a motorcycle. 
I always travel too far. 
I'll surely try. By the way, where's AP? 
Hi! These flowers are very good. 
But if you have given it to me in person, it'd have been better. 
How do you know that I had brought them. 
Because you're the only one who knows.. 
..how much I love blue orchids. 
I had brought it for you but then you never have time for me. 
That's your problem. You're the best in this office. 
Yet you let others overtake you.. 
..and end up being at the last. 
You're upset about your show, isn't it? 
But I'm even happier that your show was a hit. 
Just a second. 
Good Lord! He'll never agree. Yes.. - Who is it? 
An old friend of mine from Delhi. 
The poor guy might be willing to congratulate you. 
This guy wants to marry me. - What?! 
Yes. The last time when I went to Delhi. 
He said, 'I love you'. 
What did you say? 
I refused of course. 
I hate such Romeos who don't know their limits. 
If you're a friend, just be one. 
Why do you have to become my lover? 
That's why I like you. 
You're not like that. You're well aware of your limits. 
You can't even look at a girl in the wrong manner. 
That's for sure. 
If I can have her for a day, then every eye will be on me. 
I hope I hit the jackpot today, O' Lord! 
Hey Rangila! Give me a lottery ticket. - Yes. Take it. 
I got it! I got it! 
But the lottery is for Rs.2 crores. 
Why are you giving me Rs.500? 
I'll give the rest after the draw. Keep this for now. 
If the draw isn't over yet, then why are you giving me this? 
Someone might hear it. 
Because I've fallen in love with you. 
Scoundrel! Rascal! Fool! I'm married and have two kids. 
It doesn't make any difference to me. 
Just agree and you'll get Rs.500 everyday. 
My husband is a million times better than you. 
I love him a lot and you want to buy me for Rs.500?! 
Give me your hand with love. 
These hands are meant to wash vessels not beat me up. 
Accept it! A third hand?! - It's mine. Rascal! Punk! - No, sir. No! 
How many times do I have to tell you.. 
..to curb this cheap habit of yours? - I'll never do it again. 
It seems you'll never improve yourself. - I'll never do it again. 
I'm sorry. - Apologise to her. - I'm sorry. I Please forgive me. 
If you repeat it I'll throw this tin box of yours outside the area. 
No, sir. I'll never do it again. I promise. 
Please let go off my hair. You're spoiling my hairstyle. 
This was the only shop you could choose? 
C'mon! - Go! - You! 
Where's the Rs.500 bill! 
It was a very good family. Please remember, Lord. 
If the alliance is fixed this time.. 
..then I'll offer you One kg and 250 gm of sweetmeat. 
Even if you offer 250 quintals of sweetmeat instead of.. 
..one kg and 250 gm. 
Your daughter will still remain unmarried. 
LP! How many times have I told you not to talk like that?! 
If my talking right would've made a difference.. 
..then your daughter would be having fun at her in-laws' place. 
And your son would be well settled. 
Here comes the problem! 
You've returned, dear. - Here's the smart-alecky guy of the house. 
People finish their stories in hundreds of episodes. 
He finished his in just one. It's a world record. 
He has returned very tired from work. 
Let him rest in peace for some time. 
If I rest in peace, then how'll he do the same? 
He has studied so much. 
But has never been able to win any race in life. 
The day I run a race, I'll win the Derby directly. 
I've told him a hundred times to stop running after these channels. 
Join the municipality like me. So what if I've retired? 
I can still get you a job there. 
I've told you a hundred times to forget the municipality. 
I want to do something different. 
In the process of doing something different.. 
..you've ended up doing nothing. 
Stop it. Enough. 
Here, dear. - It's better that I read the newspaper.. 
..at least it doesn't answer back. 
In Gujrat, a storm.. 
Son, Misha's neighbours had come to see your sister today. 
I feel that they liked her a lot. 
How can those who didn't like the snacks made.. 
..your daughter, like her? 
You couldn't find a better alliance than him? 
What could I do? My parents fixed it. 
I can give it to you in writing that she'll never get married. 
Hey, what happened? Did you feel bad about what dad said? 
AP, ever guy wants a wife as radiant as the moon. 
But even the moon has dark spots on it. 
Oh dear, I know one such guy! - Who? How's he? 
Just like our dad. 
I can burn or rot to death but a guy like dad.. 
Thank you so much. 
Mom! Dad! - AP, who's the one in our colony.. 
..whose son is so rich? 
How are you? - How are you? 
Doesn't he look like Tinu? - How are you, son? 
Hi AP! - It's Tinu. 
100% - Hi Tinu! 
Hi AP! - Hi Prasad! 
Hi. - Did you hit the jackpot in Jeddah? 
You can call it that. I'm a loader in the Jeddah airport. 
Wow. - I earn upto Rs.1 lakh in Indian currency. 
A lakh! What are you saying? 
Tinu, haven't you studied only upto the 10th standard? 
By God's grace. What are you doing, AP? 
You're just how I had left you. 
Even the car is the same. - It's not his. It's mine! Mine! 
Not yours, but your dad's. 
Come along with me, I'll get you a job. You'll earn well. 
I'm not going to be a loader. - He won't be a loader. 
He'll be the owner of an airport. 
Or he'll buy oil wells in Saudi and will expect us to drown in it. 
Earlier, my mom used to thrash me and tell me.. 
..that AP ranks first in class. It's just God's grace.. 
..that I've risen up and you all have remained where you were. 
God is great! Bye! See you later. 
Is this how you do justice? You do good for the bad.. 
..and never do good for the good. 
Look! Look! He stands in the center of the colony.. 
..and abuses his dad! 
I'm not telling you, I'm telling the one above. 
I'm the one standing above. - There's one above you, too.. 
..and he's my enemy. 
Sir, sometimes I feel that you're right. 
Even God doesn't listen to the poor. 
I didn't win anything even today. 
Then who did? - Someone called Yash Chopra. 
Don't ever give money to those who need it. - Yes. 
Give it to those who don't need it. 
Where do I give you money from? 
If you want money, then tell your mom to sell this house.. 
..and bring your parents to the streets at this age. 
"Beloved, I am crazy." 
"Listen to the poor, he'll listen to you." 
"If you give Re.1, he'll give you Rs.10 crore." 
Give me just Re.1, sir, in the name of the Lord. 
God doesn't listen to me, how he will listen to you. 
He doesn't have the time to shift attention from.. 
..Napean Sea road, Warden road to listen to your pleas. 
Do you want to earn money? - Of course. 
Then sing a remix. "Kaanta Laga.. Chadti Jawaani.." 
Sing it for me once. 
"My blooming youth, my enchanting gait.." 
"You never could value it, Rama. O Rama.." 
Did you get the secret now? Yes. Very nice. - AP. 
Will leave now. - Come on. 
Go. 
"A thorn pricked me." - Everybody is useful here. 
What's wrong with him? - Nothing, just like that. 
That beggar was suddenly singing such weird songs, isn't it? 
I taught him to. If he sings movie songs, he'll earn well. 
Else he'll starve to death. 
Do you want to eat? - No. 
Why will you? You must be having food cooked by your mom. 
Yes, but dad had cooked today. 
Even your dad cooks? 
Yes, If you eat the food cooked by him.. 
..then you don't feel hungry all day. 
I understood. Here, have a sandwich. Eat it. 
Why was he angry today? 
He doesn't need a reason to be angry. 
Dad scolded me at home, now the boss will scold me. 
AP! Arun Prajapathi, the great. - Thank you, sir. 
Thank you. There's a good news for you. 
Thank you, sir. - Believe it or not. We've shelved the programme. 
Sir, what will I do then? 
Whether you like it or not, you'll read the weather report. 
Weather? Weather report?! Me?! 
A storm is expected on the western coast of Goa. 
Here. 
No, sir. I'm a very creative person, sir. 
I can't handle these weather forecasts. 
I've told you. You can manage my position. 
Sir, listen to a new idea of mine. 
I don't want to. - Sir, it's a wonderful show. 
It'll be the best one. We'll beat every other show. 
I don't want it. 
This is not a show about long beards, moustaches and kisses. 
It's ten times better than all that. 
Not me, explain it to Alia. - Alia? 
If she approves of it and gives an assurance.. 
..then I have no problem. 
I'll talk about the show later. 
Alia, I've to tell you something. - What? 
Alia.. 
I love you a lot. 
You are the first girl whom I am telling this to. 
I love you. 
Why are you staring at me? 
This is my show. 
How will you find out if I'm speaking the truth or not? 
Ok, that wasn't funny. Tell me seriously, what is it? 
Have you heard of a lie detector? - Yeah. 
It's now available even with.. 
..the Indian police, the RAW and IB. 
We'll import a lie detector. 
And invite people, for eg, policemen, politicians, etc. 
We'll make them sit on the chair and question them and.. 
..if they're lying then it'll blink red.. 
..and they'll be caught red-handed. 
Fantastic idea! Start working on this idea right away. 
But AP, I've given a personal assurance for this show. 
I hope nothing goes wrong. 
Don't worry. This show is of utmost importance to me. 
I'll put my life at stake for it. 
All the best. 
Son! Shall I get tea for you? - Mom, haven't you slept yet? 
I've been noticing that you're working all night these days. 
I've got a new show, mom. 
Work with complete dedication.. 
..and I fully believe that you'll be a rage. 
You'll beat everybody! - Is it? 
Just assume that the shot has been fired. 
All the other channels have been floored. 
Once my show becomes a hit then respect, wealth.. 
..cars, bungalows, MP's wedding in UP. 
MP has to get married but so do you. 
Did you speak to Walia or not? 
Not Walia, mom. It's Alia. 
Yes, Alia. Talk to her soon. 
I'll talk to her once my show becomes a hit. 
You're very slow and the girls these days are fast. 
If a guy as fast as her comes into her life then.. 
Sir, it's the staffs' parking space. 
Alia, I've thought about the name of the show. - What? 
Liars, Liars pants on fire. - Nice. 
Parking full. 
Who has parked in my space? 
Sir, a star has come to the office. 
A star? 
Wonderful! Wonderful! 
You've added to our channel's strength. 
Do something that might get our channel the highest TRP.. 
Alia! Alia, please come. 
Meet him. Our channel's new creative head. Rakesh Sharma. 
Rocky! - Oh my God! Rocky! 
Alia. - I can't believe it. 
How's life. - Great, dear. 
Didn't I surprise you? - Big time. 
Do you know each other? - Since long. 
Sir, you all know her as Alia. 
I've known her since she was called Alu. 
Stop it. - Okay, Alu.. Sorry Alia.. - Sir! 
Explain everything to him. 
Of course, sir. - Alright, everybody, get to work now. 
Just a moment. AP, this is Rocky. Rocky, this is AP. 
Alright. - I recognized him. 
That show, 'Mano Ya Na Mano'?! 
That teeth breaking episode.. very funny show, man. 
Believe me, the funniest show I've seen. - Shall we go the office? 
To discuss the show. - Very funny show. - Yes. 
Rocky has come just now. Will talk to him.. 
..and then come to your cabin. - Congrats. Great show! 
It's been rightly said that if you've unfortunate.. 
..even a short man sitting on a camel.. 
..gets bitten on his knee by a dog. 
When you couldn't find somebody in India.. 
..you sent someone from London. Did you hear me? 
No? Just last night, mom told me that someone else.. 
..might come into Alia's life. 
And you sent that guy today itself. 
You pushed me?! 
You won't ever come down. But the day I come up.. 
..I'll teach you a lesson. 
But I won't come there so soon, understood?! 
Sir, little bit. - No. 
Listen, I wanted to ask you something. 
Everybody in the office was happy to see me. 
Why did AP turn pale? 
Sir, if you love a girl and she hugs somebody else.. 
..then won't your face turn pale? 
Is it? Who is it? - Alia. 
Alia?! Does Alia love AP? 
No! No. AP loves Alia. 
Ok, fine. 
"Somebody is hero here." 
Where will you sit? 
Here. - Ok 
Tell me something. This Rocky. What is he? 
He's a wonderful guy. We were doing a course in Delhi, right? 
Yes. - You never realize how the day passes by with him. 
He's such a funny guy. Like that. 
I think he's a very boring guy. Very boring. 
Brother, get into the habit of listening to praise about me. 
Because henceforth, you're only going to hear them. 
Will you have coffee, Rocky? - No need. 
I think big brother is in a hot mood today. 
And one shouldn't have coffee when he's hot. 
Its not good for health. - Right. 
That's why I'll drink it. 
I'm sorry. 
Alia got this coffee for me. 
Do you want to drink the coffee because you want to.. 
..or because Alia brought it? 
You know.. 
Alia, look at his expression. We should do a show with him. 
Angry with the world. 
I had told you, he has a mind blowing sense of humor. 
Why are you laughing so much? 
Sorry. - I don't find him funny at all. 
AP, you don't know to laugh, do you at least know to play pool? 
Of course I can. - C'mon! 
Let's play pool. - No.. no.. 
The one who loses will pay all the canteen bills today. 
AP, don't play with him. He's very good. 
Come to pap, dear.. - But I'm very, very, very good. C'mon! 
Let's toss. You've to tell me which ball is in which hand. 
Ok. 
Black ball in the right hand. 
Ok. 
I've won the toss and I'll win the game too. 
The guy plays well. Great shot! - Great shot! 
Seeing you he is not feeling well. Good one, dear. 
What is this? 
You wait and see, AP is not going to win this. 
Good shot! Nice photography! - Now, see this shot. - Shot? 
Show-off! Let my chance come. 
Wow, what a shot. 
AP's done for. 
All of them have gone because they were easy. 
Don't feel too happy. Let's see if you pot the black one. 
Just see how I pot the black one. 
I told you it won't go! - It did. - Oh no.. 
I knew Rocky was going to win. 
Thank you, brother. You helped me win. 
Ladies and gentlemen, the drinks are on the house.. 
..because of the loser. 
You didn't even get a chance to show.. 
I warned you because I knew he was the champion in Delhi. 
Tell me now that he's the champion from Delhi. 
Play with me now. - C'mon! - I won't play. 
And listen all you greedy people of channel One. 
Whoever eats will vomit blood just after talking forty steps.. 
..and then breathe their last. 
Breathe their last. 
Loser! Loser! - What are you doing? Come on. 
Loser! Loser! 
Does Alia know that AP loves her? 
AP never dares to tell her. - Is he a chicken? 
A complete chicken. 
How far has he reached? - He has reached nowhere. 
He has become a driver. He just gives her lift from home to office and back. 
I'll do the same from now. From home to office and back. 
Even you? 
What? - Driver. - Lover! 
My formula guy is here! 
What are you doing? 
Couldn't you find any other car to commit a suicide? 
May my enemies commit suicide! 
I want to live now. Your idea is brilliant. 
To sing remix songs. For 15 years now, I was tired of.. 
..begging in the name of the Lord. 
I wouldn't even get two rolls of stale bread. 
Nowadays, I only eat burger. 
Go and beg else you'll have to get back to stale breads. 
Yes. "I'll build a house opposite yours.." 
What are you doing here? 
I'm returning after collecting the lottery from the head office. 
But I see you honking from here and that lady waving out.. 
.. from there, everyday. - What's your problem? 
If you do it, then it's disco and if I do it it's a striptease. 
If you do it then it's love, if I do it, it's flirting. 
You beat up anybody who talks to a girl. 
And you, yourself park your junk.. 
..outside a girl's house to tease her. 
You piece of junk! - You won't leave unharmed, isn't it? 
What can you do to me? 
Listen, you piece of junk! 
If there's a God and if he's listening to me.. 
..then I curse you that that girl won't go with you. 
Who's this new guy? 
What are you doing here? 
A problem with your car? - This car? 
If I sell one wheel of this car.. 
..I can buy three junk boxes like yours. 
Laugh now. 
Why have you come here? - To pick up Alia. 
Alia will come with me. 
Aren't you ashamed? How can you give a lift.. 
..to such a pretty girl in such an ugly car? 
How arrogant! 
Hi AP! - Hi Alia! - Rocky! 
What are you doing? - What are you doing? 
Careful, you'll soil your jeans. It's rusted. Its a dirty car. Stay away. 
What are you doing here? 
I came to pick you up. - But I go with AP everyday. 
Come with me today. - C'mon, it's getting late.. 
AP won't like it. - Even I won't like it. 
C'mon Alia, it's getting late for office. 
Sorry Rocky. I'll see you at work, okay? 
Bye Rocky.. 
C'mon! 
God bless you. - God bless you. 
Oh God, he always gets into some problem. 
Not just the clutch, the whole car is a problem. 
What now, Alia? Shall we go? 
I'm sorry, AP. It'll get very late for office. 
Shall I go with Rocky? - Okay. 
You don't mind? - No. 
C'mon Alia. You'll be late. 
Call for a mechanic. - From a dirty car.. 
..to a good car. 
Bye, come soon. 
Sell this car and buy a secondhand cycle with that money. 
At least there won't be a starting problem. 
Only manpower. 
You listened to Rangila! But you'll never listen to me. 
From among a population of 111 crores.. 
..you couldn't find anybody except me?! 
From among so many cars in the world.. 
..you could find only mine?! 
From among so many girls in the world.. 
..you found only mine?! Alia! 
Why?! What is the problem that you have with me? 
When will you leave me alone?! 
What's this? You want to burn me with the rays of the sun? 
I won't burn. 
What are you doing outside my cabin? 
You tell me what you are doing. 
Where's Alia ma'am? 
She came with Rocky two hours back. 
Has she come or will she be coming? 
What are saying? She left two hours earlier, right in front of me. 
She's left. She has left you. 
Do you remember what I said? 
When unfortunate, even a dwarf.. 
.,.atop a camel gets bitten by a dog. 
You keep sitting. They must now be in some hotel.. 
Shut up! Alia didn't go anywhere with him. 
What are you saying? Didn't you see that day.. 
..she hugged him a.. s if she had rediscovered her lost love. 
Now sit with folded hands.. 
..she's not going to let go of this opportunity. 
She's not going to let go of this opportunity? 
What are you doing? - Love. 
No! - I've waited four years for you, I won't let go .. 
..of this opportunity today. 
No! No! Alia is not that kind of a girl. 
But Rocky.. he's a rascal. He won't let go of this opportunity. 
For God sake, let go off me, Rocky. 
What are you doing, Rocky? - Love. 
I've been thirsting for your love for four years. 
I won't let go of this opportunity today. 
You don't know my AP. If he comes to know.. 
..he'll not spare you. - I don't care. 
You're right, Alia. I'm coming. 
Idiot, I won't spare you alive! 
Where are you going? 
Alia is in danger. I'm going to save her. 
No, no. She's not in danger but in love. 
They must be roaming around hand in hand. 
Singing duets at the beach. 
"I'll take you to Aksa beach. Are you coming?" 
"I'll take you to Aksa beach. Are you coming?" 
"I'll buy you tea, are you coming?" 
"I am tired hearing all this." 
"I am tired of roaming with you." 
"Let it be. Let it be. Don't show me such dreams." 
"I'll take you to meet Bachchan, are you coming?" 
"I'll ask Adnan to lift too, are you coming?" 
"Don't you dare create obstacles in my path!" 
"I'm the elder one, you're younger." 
"You're a B.A., I'm an M.A." 
Listen, elder one. There're are better ones waiting for her." 
"People are queuing up for her." 
"You are messing up with me unnecessarily." 
"I'm tired of listening to you." 
"I'm fed up of roaming with you." 
"Let it be. Let it be. Don't show me such dreams." 
"I'll make you talk to the Don, are you coming?" 
"I'll teach you Gandhi-ism, are you coming?" 
"Give me, give me, give me some." 
"Give me some tonight." 
"Give me, give me, give me some." 
"Give me some tonight." 
"Learn the lessons of love." 
"My heart is a school for you." 
"I'm the teacher and you're my student." 
"Listen teacher, I'm a student of yours, I'll serve you." 
"Teach me the lesson of love." 
"Why didn't you start when I was born?" 
"I'm tired of listening to you." 
"I am tired of roaming with you." 
"Let it be. Let it be. Don't show me such dreams." 
"I'll make you his sister-in-law, are you coming?" 
"I'll make you his sister, are you coming?" 
I searched the whole city. I am tired of sitting here. 
Has she come? - Not yet. 
Don't know where he took her. - If you don't tell her about.. 
..your feelings soon, then he'll take her forever. 
I'll give her this today. I'll tell her in a few days. 
Even now you want to wait for a few days? 
Do today what you want to do tomorrow! 
How many times have I told you not to sit here? 
He gets scared on seeing you. 
And what's this? You've even brought your brother?! 
Brother? - Now you'll invite your entire family here. Great! 
Don't worry, baby! Don't get scared. They're just humans. 
Let's go. 
If only God had made me a dog instead of a human.. 
..I would've been in her lap instead of being with you. 
She would've been kissing me! 
Forget it, pal. 
It's time for my dinner. Do you want to eat anything? 
Don't know what will he have. No, thank you. 
I am not hungry. 
Hello, China Garden. Yes. 
Sweet corn soup. One vegetable fried rice. 
Manchurian gravy and one cup fruit salad. 
Fast! Ghansu! The beggar. Remember? 
Send it fast. Yes. 
The car has come. - Alia is there. - Yes, she is there. 
What are they doing? - Getting out of the car. 
And? Is Alia happy? - Very happy. 
They're hugging now. - Hugging?! - Yes. 
Okay goodnight, Rocky. Bye. - Bye. 
She's going, swaying her hips. Yes. 
What's he doing? - He's jumping around like a monkey. 
Has taken off his jacket. He's dancing his way home. 
He went. Come on, hurry up. 
Brother, are you playing hide and seek. 
"My heart isn't at rest without my beloved." 
What are you doing outside Alia's house? 
If you're keeping an eye on Alia.. 
..then I'm also keeping an eye on you. 
Aren't you ashamed of spying on her in the garb of a beggar? - No. 
You chameleon! 
She's your friend and you love her. 
You chameleon! 
Shall I tell her? - No. - She'll feel so bad. - Don't do that. 
What's this? What's this? 
What's this? - Gift. 
It's not a gift. It's a bribe to get love. 
You're surely going to make her cry. 
Rocky. Why did you come back? 
I had bought a gift for you. I forgot to give it. 
What was the need for that? 
I mean.. - Please. 
Thanks. 
What happened? 
What happened? 
I'm shivering. - What? 
I'm scared a little. Feeling uneasy. - Why? 
A dengue mosquito stung me. 
Oh my God! Come inside. I'll check your temperature. C'mon! 
Oh God! God! God! 
When you're done worshipping God.. 
..then you can worship your husband also. 
I've been asking for bitter gourd juice since two hours. 
But nobody is bothered. 
This is what happens after retirement. 
Madhu, give your dad a glass of bitter gourd juice. 
Give him some honey along with it. 
He might start talking sweetly. - Shut up. 
Pray with me. 
Mother, for years, you've offered.. 
..fruits, flowers, oil. Whatever has been offered to him. 
Had you saved that money, your son would've.. 
..owned a new car today, mom. 
Don't say such things, God will be offended. 
When was he pleased? What has he given us anyway? 
What hasn't he given us? 
He has given me good children. 
What else does one need? 
He gave you good children but never did anything for them. 
No! An unemployed son killed his father.. 
..and also managed to get acquitted? 
If only.. - His mother committed a suicide. 
C'mon, dear. Let's have breakfast. 
Father. - Who are you? - Madhu! Madhu! Madhu! 
What's that smeared on your face? 
It's not smeared. I've applied crushed berries on my face. 
What does that do? - It clears all the marks on one's face. 
You had said the same thing after smearing.. 
..gourd, cucumber and orange. 
How many times have I told you to use a spoon not your fingers? 
You never listen. - He likes fingering everything. 
I have ten of them. - Stuffed cauliflower bread. 
Wow, mother! I wanted to eat stuffed bread. 
Eat, son. Eat! You ate from my salary earlier.. 
..now eat from my pension. Eat! Eat! 
Son, you're getting up without eating your breakfast. 
Enough mother. I am full. - Son, have your breakfast. 
I'll start drinking now. 
You'll have to pay heavily. 
Ma'am, how do you tolerate it? 
Sir is at home all day. My Dagdu sits at home.. 
..but he still loves me a lot. He doesn't sit at home and complain. 
Go and do your work. - I'm going. Going. 
Oh god! 
He left without eating. 
What's your problem? He's working. 
What work does he do? His show flopped. 
These are all temporary jobs. 
He should work in the municipality like me. 
You'll get a salary till your sixty and a pension till you die. 
God knows what work he does. 
Wait and watch! My son will become famous someday. 
Understood? 
Finally all done! 
Son, you're working very hard this time. 
See, this time God will surely make you a success. 
Mom, bring in anybody but not him. 
See, I've got an allergy. 
Shut up! Your work never gets done because you talk like this. 
See, I've made this amulet for you with a lot of devotion. 
Wear this and see how all your work gets done in a jiffy. 
I'll wear it because you're telling me to, mom. 
But if I ever have to face an obstacle after wearing this.. 
..there'll be none more worse than me. 
Nothing bad will happen. You can see it today. 
AP, does this chair really work? 
Alia, I want you to sit on this chair first. 
But what do I say? 
Whatever you feel like. 
AP, I'm very happy. And my heartfelt wishes that.. 
..your show becomes a success. 
The green light is glowing. 
It's straight from the heart. For AP. 
I can see two chairs. Wedding chairs. 
AP on one and Alia on the other. 
I'll surely go to congratulate them. 
This is great. - Yes, I'll go to congratulate them. 
This is amazing. This show will be sensational. 
You just watch! - The show hasn't begun yet. I won't let it begin. 
"Party all night. Let's party." 
"Party all night. Let's party."

Ladies and gentlemen, may I've your attention please. Thank you. 
It's now time to announce our.. 
..new program, "Liar, liar pants on fire." 
All the best to you. - Thank you. 
Look. - I think, this is the right thing. 
Everybody's waiting. What are you doing? 
Did you connect it properly? - What's happening? 
Hurry up, please. - I am trying. 
Why isn't it working? - AP, I had told you. 
There isn't any scope of mistake this time. - What do I do.. 
..if his laptop is faulty? - Faulty laptop? 
No, sir. His DVD is corrupted. - DVD? 
No, sir. Your luck is bad. You're ruined. 
The sponsors, the media and the guests are outside. 
Oh God. - What have you done, AP? 
Sir, don't listen to him.. - Shut up! Shut up! 
Rocky, please do something. Save me and my channel.. 
..from this embarrassment. 
Sir, Alia had told me about the concept. 
So I had prepared a presentation. - Yes. 
Shall I play that? - Please. Please. 
Play anything as long as it saves me from being disgraced. 
Please! Put it on. 
That's like it. Well done, Rocky! Well done! 
Well done, rocky. What a presentation. fantastic! 
You prepared this presentation? You prepared? 
You made this? - Hey! What kind of behavior is this? 
Sir, I prepared this presentation. I made it! - What? 
Brother, such a blatant lie! 
He saved the channel from disgrace.. 
..and you caught him by his collar? 
Sir, this presentation.. - What? 
Sir, I don't want any credit for this program. 
He's afraid that I'll replace him in his own show. 
Sir.. - Brother, this show will remain yours. 
No way! Now, Rocky will do this show. 
Sir.. - And you get out of here. Get out! 
I said, get out of here. 
And don't ever dare to show your face here. 
Sir, give AP an opportunity to clarify his stand. 
I had given him this opportunity only on your behest. 
What difference did it make? 
Thank you! Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. 
Thank you! The creator of the show you viewed just now.. 
..is Rakesh Sharma, your Rocky. - Thank you everyone. 
Why do you break the car? Beat me. Kill me. 
Why did you send me to this world? 
To trouble me? 
This amulet was given to me by mom with so many expectations. 
A mother is given the same respect as.. 
..God but you can't tolerate her blessings. 
My mother is naïve. Naïve. 
She worships you despite all the problems you create. 
This amulet was blessed by you, isn't it? 
Take it back. 
AP. You have come. I couldn't sleep as I was so happy. 
I was thanking God all night. 
It has been launched, isn't it son? 
Is everything alright, son? Arun? 
What is it? What happened? 
Everything's over. I've lost my job too. 
Dad is right. 
I'm good for nothing. 
Hello! - Hello! Arun Prajapathi? 
'I heard that you've quit your job with the channel.' 
I didn't quit, I was kicked out. 
'If you want a new job then come to the Hyatt hotel.. 
..18th floor, 1801. Come there.' 
I'll wait for you. - Thank you. I'm grateful to you. 
'The car is broken. He lost his job last night.' 
Who knows what he is avenging? He'll ruin us. 
'You please keep quiet. He is already tensed.' 
Father, the good thing about bad times is that.. 
..it passes away. 
You're the only one who doesn't. 
Come in, Arun Prajapati. 
Anybody here? 
Arun Prajapati. - Yes, sir? - Please sit. 
Sir, I can hear you but you're nowhere to be seen. 
Humans aren't allowed to see me hence I'm invisible. 
Oh! Invisible? Invisible! 
What kind of a joke is this? 
You called me up and asked me to come. 
And now that I've come, you tell me that you're invisible? 
Who are you? - I'm God. 
Hey! You don't become God by calling yourself one. 
Look, I don't like such jokes. 
Just last night, I have lost my job. 
I'm already upset. Don't upset me more. 
You are cracking jokes at such a sad time! 
I don't want your job. I'm leaving. 
Excuse me. Who's staying at 1801? Who's he? 
Sorry, sir. There isn't any 1801 room here. 
The room on the eighteenth floor. On the right. 
Sir, this hotel has only 15 floors, not 18. 
Are you sure? - Yes, sir. 
Thank God! God! 
Come in, Arun Prajapati. 
Arun Prajapati, you wanted to see me, right? 
See me! 
Who are you? - God. 
God? In the form of a man? 
I had to take the form of a man to appear before you. 
How do I believe that you're God? 
You had thrown this amulet at me last night. 
So you were there last night. 
You picked up my amulet, heard all that I said.. 
..and gave me a call asking me to come here if I wanted a job. 
And now that I've come here, you're making me hear voices.. 
..making rooms disappear and even telling me that you're God. 
How do I believe that you're God? 
Why should I believe that you're God? 
What noise is this? It sounds familiar! 
Don't worry! Don't worry, you won't fall. 
It's solid right? - Absolutely solid. 
Don't leave my hand. 
I am scared of height. 
Do you believe me now? - Yes. 
That's the problem with you, humans. 
You don't believe unless I perform miracles. - Correct. 
But shall I ask you something? - Yes. 
Neither did I meet with an accident.. 
..nor did I fall sick. Then why am I up here and the world down? 
Tell me, God, have I passed away from the world? 
No. - Then why did you call me up so high? 
What do you want from me? 
Not me, what do you want from me? - Me?! - Yes. 
Since the day I've created this world.. 
..I've created millions of humans. 
All of them like me, love me and worship me. 
Sometimes when there's a calamity they get upset with me. 
But then you're the only one who shouts at me.. 
..even when you break the windshield of your car. 
That's right. All the problems in my life are because of you. 
Whenever things are going right for me, you do something to spoil it. 
God, shall I tell you something? 
Please don't feel bad. 
Not just me, nobody in this world is happy with you. 
They say that you created the world and forgot about it. 
I forgot about my own world? 
There are just two fathers in this world.. 
..who gave life and forgot about us. 
One is my biological father and the other is you. 
You sit high up and watch the world. 
Be among the humans and see their world. 
Live amidst them and feel their pain and problems. 
See how it feels when his sister sits unmarried at home. 
When he doesn't get the girl he loves. 
When he loses his source of income. 
You say that we're your children. 
You trouble your children, aren't you ashamed? 
If everybody had a house, a car and a bungalow.. 
..then everybody would've worshipped you. 
Whatever I've given one is, what is good for him. 
His well-being lies in it. 
But whose well-being lies in problems and pain. 
But you won't understand this. 
Because you're God, not human. 
You don't have a human heart in you. 
And only a human can understand one, not God. 
You mean to say that if a human instead of me had.. 
..reigned over the world, he would've done a better job? 
Of course. 
Ok. 
I'll give you all my powers. 
You shall rule the world for the next 10 days. 
I shall definitely do a better job than you. 
What noise is this? 
They're prayers and requests that people all over.. 
..the world are asking me. Now that you've become God.. 
..you're able to hear them. 
Stop it! 
Now make me hear them only when I ask you to. 
Remember one thing. Don't tell anybody that you're God. 
Else you'll lose all your powers. - Ok. Done. 
Now whatever I am, however I am, it's me for the next ten days! 
Sorry. 
Bless you. 
Listen, you wouldn't be wearing underwear. 
If you are wearing one, then apart from.. 
..it take off everything else. 
Tuck your shirt in like me. 
Good morning, sir. 
What are you doing, baldie? Get the car. 
Sir, the car didn't get started. It is right where it was. 
Sir, you changed your clothes. Now change the car too. 
Oh smarty! 
I'll make hair grow on your ears. 
Did you hear? In your world, it was like this. 
In my world.. just watch. 
"I run faster than life." 
"Time is behind me. I am ahead." 
"I was something yesterday.." 
"I'm something else today. I won't stop for anyone now." 
"I run faster than life." 
"Time is behind me. I am ahead." 
"I was something yesterday.." 
"I'm something else today. I won't stop for anyone now." 
"If I wish I can turn day into night and night into day." 
"Into day.." 
"Into day.." 
"O' God! O' God!" 
"O' God, you're great." 
"O' God, you're great." 
"O' God, you're great." 
"O' God, you're great." 
"I can touch the sky by stretching my hands." 
"The moon and the stars play near me." 
"Morning walks holding my finger." 
"In my control are the two worlds." 
"The key to luck and the rein of life are in my hands." 
"I can make whoever I want to dance to my tunes." 
"I've the power in my words." 
"I'm the master of the universe." 
"I can do whatever I want to.." 
"I can do whatever I want to.." 
"O' God! O' God!" 
"O' God, you're great." 
"O' God, you're great." 
"O' God, you're great." 
"O' God, you're great." 
"I'm the nature, I'm the power." 
"Then why did you give me this problem?" 
"I'm the earth and the heaven." 
"Then grant every prayer." 
"I hold the highest place, there's none higher than me." 
"If we weren't there then who would pray to you?" 
"I'm so omniscient that I grant before being asked for." 
"If you're such an ocean of mercy.. 
..then why don't you grant us our wishes? 
"I agree that you gave us brains, but see how we used it." 
"Just use your brains and tell me what did you achieve?" 
"We invented computers, robots and satellites." 
"You speak of yourself, fool! Who made you?" 
"Me!" 
"Your life is in my hands, you tell me what do I do?" 
"What do I do?" "What do I do?" 
"O' God, you're great." 
"O' God, you're great." 
"O' God, you're great." 
"O' God, you're great." 
Calm down! Calm down! Let us do our job! 
Hey, shut up! Why are you making noise? 
The police aren't agreeing to our demands. 
Rascals! Let's take them out one by one and finish them. 
Do one thing, bring all of them here. 
Let me go inside. Please, let me go. 
Children are a form of God, only God can save them now. 
"Oh God!" 
You can't go in. - Why? What happened? 
There was a birthday party going on at King's Burger. 
Some terrorists barged in. 
Every child's life is endangered. 
They're even firing at us. 
Send some commandos. 
What will those commandos do, when this commando is here? 
Hello children! 
Hey! Have you come here to die? 
No, to kill. 
Do you know who we are? 
You can't be God and you don't look human. 
And I hate demons. 
Take him on. 
Roast him! 
"Oh God!" 
"Oh God!" 
Get him! 
"Oh God!" 
"Oh God!" 
Kill the children. 
What's going on? How is it going up? 
"Oh God!" 
"Oh God!" 
"Oh God!" 
Hey, throw it or it'll explode! 
Hey! - Back off! 
Hey kids! - What? 
These bad uncles troubled you a lot, isn't it? - Yes. 
It's our turn now. - Yes. 
We'll make them cry now. - Yeah! 
Go! 
Let go off me! 
Spiderman, stick to it. 
Pull him! Pull him! 
C'mon, Superman! 
There he is hiding. 
Praise be to Lord Hanuman! 
Praise be to Lord Hanuman! 
Hey Krish! 
Batman! 
Hit him and turn him into a ball. 
Shaktiman! 
He looks like a magician. Casts charms with his eyes. - Yes. 
I'll blindfold him. - Yes, boss. 
Come on. 
You took it back. - "Oh God." 
You took back the powers. 
You took back the powers. 
You took back the powers. 
God! 
What did I say? - What? 
That nobody should know that you've God's powers. - Yes. 
And you're showing off in front of everybody. 
Sorry God! 
Actually I was just testing the powers. My mistake. 
I'll never do it again. Let me go back. 
It's a question of the children's lives. Please. 
Ok. But keep it in mind henceforth. 
Ok, boss. Sorry.. God. 
Save me! 
Save me! 
Hey, please help me from these demons. 
Look at my hands.. my legs. - Enough! 
My father! 
Fools! Learn to love your country, not betray it. 
Understood? 
Wow! 
Move! Move.. back! 
'All the kids are out escaping from the terrorists.' 
'We have to yet to see whether all the kids are out are not.' 
'And we have to see..' 
Where are the terrorists? 
Patriots, come out. 
Hail Mother India! 
We'll lay down our lives for our nation! 
Hail Mother India! 
Hail Mother India! 
We'll lay down our lives for our nation! 
How did you manage to do all this? 
Get those channel people away from here then I'll do it. 
Come on, let's go. 
The one who should've been only on my channel.. 
..he's on every channel except mine. 
I want AP! 
Sir, I know AP. He's a chicken. A coward! 
He must've fought out of fear for his life. 
He's not a hero. 
He'll ensure the closure of our channel. 
He's become the public hero in a day. Think of it. 
How much our channel can profit from him. 
Sir, where do you think from? - I.. 
Sir, you've insulted him so much. Why would he come back? 
I'll plead before him. I'll fall at his feet. 
I'll say, AP I've forgiven so many mistakes of yours. 
Please forgive me for once. 
He won't come. - He won't come. 
He'll agree if Alia requests. 
A son confiscates father's property. 
Hello! Excuse me.. 
Just a moment. Are you an LIC agent? 
No. - Have you come to sell credit cards? Car loans? 
Or if you've come to talk about buying the house.. 
..then talk to HP. 
No, sir. No. You're mistaken. 
Just a moment. You tell me. 
Sir, he's Mr. Keval Chandani, the CEO of Channel One. 
That's right. - And I'm Alia Kapoor. - Oh, yeah. 
Alia?! I'm AP's sister, MP. 
And he's my father. - Father?! 
Hey! What are you doing?! At least consider your age! 
Sir. - Father, you're great. You've given birth to AP. 
Ok, fine. Fine. Sit here and talk. - Okay. 
I'll give you a suggestion. Give up this channel job. 
You can be kicked out any day. 
I still have a say in the municipality. 
I can get you a job here. 
I'll give you an application right away. - Right away! 
Alia dear, you? - Hello, mummy. 
Greetings, aunty. - Greetings - God bless you. 
I've seen you on TV quite a lot of times. 
But you look much more beautiful in person. 
Isn't it? - Like me. 
You are right. - Is AP there? - Yes, in his room. 
Where will you go leaving your God, madam? 
Beat no.8. Beat no.9. 
Welcome to your Lord's abode. 
Hi AP. Hi AP! 
Boss, you?! 
Your room is so nice. 
I imported all the furniture recently. 
Won't you ask about my grandparents? 
How are they? - They're fine. 
They passed away 150 years ago. 
Let me listen to what she's thinking about me. 
He must be thinking that I should apologise to him. 
But he should also know that there're no apologies.. 
..and thanksgivings in love. But he's so cute. 
I'll apologise. - No need to apologise. 
How did you know that I was going to apologise? 
Look, a girl in your place won't turn around and punch. 
She'll either say 'sorry' or 'I love you'. 
I felt really bad for what happened in the party. 
Even the boss is sorry about it. 
And I don't like it in office without you. 
I've come to take you, will you come along? 
Can I ever refuse you? - So you'll come? 
Obviously Alia. 
Keval sir! What bravery and what honour! 
Sir, that.. - What was the need for him to barge in there? 
But! - That's the work of the government! - Yes. 
The police! - Yes. 
The force! - You are absolutely right! 
Thankfully he survived! 
Son, is that the way to behave with guests? 
Look, your father is boring your boss! 
I have raised my son with such difficulty! 
Yes. - What if he had died? 
Am I saying something wrong? 
You are absolutely right! - Am I right? 
You are absolutely right! 
What are you nodding to everything! Saying yes for everything! 
Sir this.. - Was there anyone as brave.. 
..as my son there? - No! 
He risked his life and saved those children! 
You are absolutely right! 
I had raised him for such a day. - Yes! 
He has made me so proud! 
You are so right! - Sir! - There comes my son! 
AP! I am sorry, forgive me! 
Sir, AP has forgiven you and he has.. 
..agreed to join the channel again. 
Fantastic, AP! Thank you! 
AP has become so famous that.. 
..channel TRPs are to the roof. It's amazing. - What amazing! 
He considers himself to be a star only by taking mere.. 
..two to three interviews. - Hey! - Hi! 
Get used to hearing praises! 
Because, now you will only hear my praises in this office! 
You are repeating my line to me! 
Be original, dear? 
Will you play? - Come on. 
Set it! Warm up! 
Please AP, the last time I had told you that he's Delhi's champion. 
Don't play. - No matter where he is from? 
I will win! 
Toss! 
Tell me. 
Black ball in the right hand! 
You've lost again. 
Look. - See the ball. 
I have won the toss and I will win the game too. 
Quiet! 
How did that happen? 
It's not possible! How did you do that? 
You blind man! Didn't you see how it happened? 
Who are you? 
Where is AP? 
The one who used to lose was AP! 
You are not AP! - Come on, Rocky! 
AP was like this before, and still he is the same. 
Loser! Loser! - Bye! 
He left and you were left with the ball. 
Look at Alia! She never leaves AP for a minute! 
But I know AP! He cannot propose! 
I feel Alia will propose to him! 
Really! - Yes! 
Then I will propose to her right away. 
Do one thing.. when it is lunch break.. 
..bring a bride's attire for me. 
Shall I go right away and get my wife's? 
Second hand? - Yes. 
No. Brand new. 
Bride's attire for my Alia. - It's very beautiful. 
Why are you hitting me, sir? 
It's worth 20,000! 
At this rate, I can buy a motorcycle in India! 
Bride's attire. 
You take it to Alia! 
If she says yes.. 
..then I will buy you a car instead of a motorcycle. 
Here! 
God, now everything is in your hand. 
Absolutely. 
"Rocking." 
Hey, stop! 
Come here. 
"O God." 
Who has sent it? - Rocky.. sir! 
Lust for you. - "O God." 
Go! - Ok. 
Hello! - Alia, did you get my sms? 
I did! - And my gift too! - Yes. 
You know, whenever I think about you.. 
..you are dressed in these clothes! 
I want to take you around the whole world in these clothes! 
I want to take you home in these clothes! 
Of course! Surely! 
Right now, I am coming to meet you. 
Well done, Alia! Beat him black and blue! 
Rocky, how dare you send me such a cheap sms? 
Really! Show me! 
Such a cheap sms! 
And the clothes he had sent, that were even more disgusting. 
Shall I show you that! 
I had sent love! 
And not lust! 
Oh yes! This is not an sms but a letter.. 
..which was switched! 
I swear, Alia, I can't understand anything! 
I thought so high of you, Rocky.. 
..but you turned out to be completely the opposite! 
You know, Alia used to praise you so much! 
But you turned out to be such a cheap, dirty man! 
You chameleon! 
I know Alia is very upset with you! 
Never show your face again to her! 
Because she won't see it! - No I won't! 
Just because you are a friend, I will forgive you! 
Never talk to me again! 
You chameleon! 
I had sent her a marriage dress! 
Not a bikini! 
Do one thing, send her a bikini this time! 
This love changed to lust! 
Do you have to do something with it? - No, no. 
Only me, I am completely involved in it. Leave my hand! 
Take my advice, take an off for 30-40 years! 
Stay at home at and think about it! 
But never show your face to Alia again! Understood! 
"Oh God." 
Fine sister, we are leaving again! 
Greeting. But you didn't have anything! 
Today is our fast! 
You have arrived at the right time son. 
They have come for Madhu's alliance! 
Greeting. Greeting. Yes, yes. - This is my son, Arun! 
Who doesn't know him? 
He is a star! 
How did you find my sister? 
That.. - We will revert to you after sometime. - Yes! 
Goodbye! - Goodbye! Goodbye! - Goodbye! Goodbye! 
Goodbye! - Goodbye! 
You don't worry this time! 
They will definitely say yes this time. 
They won't revert back to us, they have thought about it! 
That he will marry any girl in the world, but not her! 
Where are you going? 
If my face is ugly! It has so many marks! 
Then what is my fault in it! 
Come with me! I will turn you into a fairy! 
See there, the star is taking his sister.. 
..to turn her into a fairy! 
Just a minute, Mr. Star! 
Tell me, which factory are you taking your sister.. 
..to turn her into a fairy! 
Come on, speak up. Speak up! 
What are you staring at? 
"Oh God." 
What happened? 
Shall I bring water? 
Tea! 
What has happened? Chavanprash! 
Tell me, what has happened to you! 
Come.. - Hello. 
Yes please, what do you want to do? 
I want to get her a full change of look! 
From the colour of the hair to scars on her face. 
Full denting, painting and scrubbing! 
Look, these are natural marks! 
Only God can cure them! 
God! - We will do as much as we can! 
No problem! 
"Happiness, I can see that you believe." 
"Yes, I know you can see what I can be." 
"Once you know and I know.." 
.."..you will change forever." 
What a girl! 
Where did this damsel come from? 
I have to entice her now. 
Get lost! - AP 
AP! 
C'mon! - Brother! Greeting, how are you? 
Hey, today you are talking very sweetly! 
Come, let us have tea! 
You never come! 
Bring her along too! Who is she? 
My sister, Madhu! - Madhu! 
Earlier she looked so ugly, and now she looks so great! 
Come brother, let us have tea! Please! - Hey! 
And whom are you looking towards? - Oh no! - Whom are you talking to? 
Do you want a beating? Do you want to get beaten up? 
Talk sweetly today! 
Hi AP!

You didn't go to Saudi! 
I have to go.. but mother was saying that..

Just think, the girl I will marry she will be so fortunate! - Yes.

Just think how much gold I will give her! 
I have found a girl for you! Look! 
You wash it and she will sweep! Nice couple, isn't it? 
Brother, she is from our neighbourhood!

She can meet her father! Meet her brother! 
Come here, come here! - Yes brother! Give me order!

Did you recognise her? 
Hey, Madhu. - Dear. - Mother. 
My daughter has really become a fairy! 
May no one cast an evil eye on her! 
The entire city has! 
Keep her at home! 
Or else I will have to thrash the entire neighbourhood! 
She is looking so beautiful. - Father! 
Mother! 
What are you doing here? 
Why? - What happened? 
You were getting very angry in the neighbourhood outside! 
Someone was staring at my sister! 
Won't the brother get angry? 
You humans are very unthankful! 
What? - Yes! 
When nobody looked at your sister.. 
..you were angry then! 
Now that the entire city is looking at her, you are worried again! 
Look! Look! 
Mischievous! 
Why do you give birth to such a mischievous person? 
I made him a human! 
Now he became mischievous here on earth then what can I do? 
Hey! What are you doing here?

Have you come to measure the pole? 
Then?

Left the job! - Yes. - Taken a flight back! - Yes! 
Hidden my face! - Yes! 
AP, I am a very sadist, foolish, pervert type of a man! 
Stay like this! 
And she will be mine! 
If she really belonged to me.. 
..then by now she would have been in your house! 
God has sent me from London.. 
..to shower my love on her. 
Right! - So let's go along with God! 
"O God!" - Why are you laughing? 
Because God has already decided! 
Come. - Come, dear. 
Hey, I got humiliated waiting for you. 
Rocky, what are you doing? - I didn't do anything!

Come on, change it. - "Oh God." 
"Oh God." 
Shut up! - "You will marry me!" 
Hey! - You asked me to sing! 
Look Mr. Chandani. - Yes, sir. 
I don't go to any program! 
But, do you know why I have come here? - Why sir? 
Because the people will say.. 
..that only Bholaram Saccha dared to sit in the lie detector! 
You are something. - You are absolutely right! 
And you know what that will mean! - I don't know, sir. 
And that will mean, that there is no other true and honest.. 
..politician like me in the world! - No sir. - How nice! 
But ask only those questions which I have written down! - Yes sir! 
Yes sir, I have reminded Rocky of all your questions! 
Ladies and gentlemen! 
Welcome to the first episode of "Liar, liar pants on fire." 
Friends, your host Rocky! 
And this is the chair. 
Meaning the machine which catches your lie. 
And today our state's Chief Minister.. 
..Mr. Bholaram Saccha will dare to sit on it. 
A big round of applause to Mr. Bholaram! - Welcome, sir. 
Greetings. Thank you. 
You had thrown me out of my shows. 
Look, now how I get you fired. 
You will say what I will make you say. 
Bholaram! 
Let me tell the audience that the questions which I will ask you.. 
..you have given me those questions beforehand. 
Say yes or no! 
No! The red light is blinking! 
He is lying. 
Look, our country's famous minister.. 
..must have killed so many people to roam in cars! - What?! 
What nonsense! 
Sir, I don't know what I am saying! Sorry, sir! 
Good. - Why should I say sorry? 
Fatso! Hippopotamus! 
Your name is Bhola! But you are a troublesome man! 
Is he mad? - I won't spare you! 
"Oh God." - I will lock you in prison! 
You will rot in mental asylum! 
What will you do, stupid! 
Alia! We will have to stop him! 
I will throw rotten eggs on you! 
And I won't miss a single target! - Rocky! 
Are you mad? Are you nuts! 
What has happened to you! - Sir! - What are you doing? 
I don't know what I'm saying all this. 
Okay, no problems. Apologize to him! 
Shut up! You lizard! Remember the bikini! 
I will make you wear it and make you.. 
..dance in front of everybody! - Rocky! Rocky! 
So many people are here! Please think of that! 
People! They are transvestites who just clap! Transvestites! 
What is he saying? 
Rocky, have you gone insane. 
Please! Please! Please! Security! - 'Leave me!' 
This guy insulted me. I tolerated it. 
But I can't tolerate people's humiliation. 
Red light! 
Rocky, are you out of your mind? - He is lying. - Leave me! 
What nonsense! - Stand there! 
Minister, I know you want.. to send me to prison! 
And you want to fire me! - No! 
And lizard! I know you hate me! 
And transvestites, I even know that you people will bash me! 
So forget this job, I am leaving this city! 
You can even leave this world! 
Rocky, what are you doing? 
Take this! - Rocky, please. 
"Oh God." 
What has happened! How did it happen? 
How did I do all this? 
This.. - No, no! His skin is very dark! 
O my God! Earlier guys used to reject you! 
And now you reject guys! 
You are fortunate! 
Now, you go and finish your work. - Here, massage it. 
Did you take your medicine? 
What do you want? You want water? 
Coffee? 
Then? What do you want? 
Son, hang on. 
Yes, mother. - Son, look at your father's state. 
He can't speak. 
Son, he is really worried. Show him to some doctor. 
Mother, since the time he has stopped talking.. 
..there is so much peace in this house. 
You should be happy. 
What are you saying, son? 
Now I am used to his cribbing. 
Now if he doesn't talk then I feel bad. 
Show him to a doctor. Yes. 
'Father must be abusing me a lot.' 
'In the old age, a person lives for his children's happiness.' 
'My son has become a star.' 
'My daughter is receiving good alliances.' 
'I don't have any worries even if I die tomorrow.' 
Wow! Father is so nice! 
His voice should be returned. 
I will be liberated! 
Hey! - HP! MP! 
People! I have got my voice back! 
You must be sad that I got my voice back! 
You got your voice back! And I got my show! 
It will go back! It's just temporary! - Thank God. 
People! - Truly, son? - Yes! 
What are you waiting for? 
Everything is going right nowadays. 
Now go and tell Alia that you love her. 
Hello! - Hello, Alia! - Hi, AP! 
Alia, counting from tomorrow, 28 years ago I had taken birth.. 
..and I had done a favour on this earth and humanity. 
Won't you meet me tomorrow to thank me for this favour? 
Where? 
Hyatt! 18th floor. 1801! 
Alia. 
Come inside. 
"I've been waiting for you. I've been looking for you." 
"I had seen you in my dreams, beloved." 
"I had seen you in my dreams, beloved." 
"My heart says, embrace me, beloved." 
"I have been just waiting for you!" 
"Beloved, I am crazy for you." 
"Beloved, I am crazy for you." 
"Hold me. Just hold me, beloved." 
"Just hold me, beloved." 
"I have been waiting.. waiting for you, girl." 
"I have been waiting, waiting, waiting for you, girl." 
"Beloved, I am crazy for you." 
"I have to express my feelings." 
"Hear it, beloved." "Hear it, beloved." 
"My heart has been affected." 
"How did it happen? I don't know." 
"Never before had it beaten like this." 
"Let me do what my heart says." 
"Let me make some mistake." 
"My heart is just yours." 
"You have struck the chords of my heart, beloved." 
"O baby!" 
"My heart says, embrace me, beloved." 
"I have been just waiting for you!" 
"Beloved, I am crazy for you." 
"Love me. Just love me, beloved." 
"When I see your face I feel." 
"The moon dwells beneath dark tresses." 
"The intoxication of your talks." 
"Have influenced me." 
"How do I believe in your love?" 
"With your eyes, read my eyes, beloved." 
"My heart says, embrace me, beloved." 
"I have been just waiting for you!" 
"Beloved, I am crazy for you." 
"Tell me. Just tell me, beloved." 
"I have been just waiting for you!" 
"Beloved, I am crazy for you." 
"Love me. Just love me, beloved." 
You! 
You behave so foolishly! 
What? - Cities are flooded! 
Countless people die! Do you know? 
Hang on! Hang on! What did I do? 
You know! For the past hours hours I was with Alia! 
You changed the position of the moon. 
The sea level increased. 
If I had not interfered then the entire city would have been flooded! 
Sorry! I didn't know! 
You should never play with nature. 
As it is, because of you people, pollution has increased so much. 
When I look from above, I can't see the world. 
What have you done to the moon? 
The colour has totally changed. 
This is not the moon. - Then? 
It's the world. - World? 
So where is the moon? - You are standing on it. 
Unbelievable! The moon looks like Ladakh. 
You saw the moon, dear. Now tell me. 
What have you done till date? 
I didn't do anything. 
Number one, I have become a star. 
Rocky has been fired. Alia has started loving me. 
My sister has become the most beautiful girl in the city! 
And she is receiving such good alliances, I can't tell you! 
My life is perfect! I am really happy! 
You did all this for yourself. - Yes. 
That day you were telling me about the world's sorrow. 
What did you do for the world? 
You forgot the world when you received the power! 
Frankly speaking God, I didn't get the time. 
But from tomorrow, I promise! I will do many things. 
Tomorrow is your last day. - What! 
Good days pass so soon. 
No problem. 
A single day is enough to bless this world. 
After all, I am God! 
Let's see! 
The task which I couldn't do in a millions of years.. 
..how will you do that in a single day! 
Sir! Wait. Today my lottery's result will be declared! 
Pray to God that I win the lottery! 
I guarantee you! Today you will win the lottery! 
Hi Alia! - Hi. - Hi AP. - Hi. 
What happened to you? Why are you crying? 
You said you were going to get me a motorcycle but.. 
Don't cry. You will get it! 
By God! - By God! Now leave! 
In this world.. whatever you want.. 
..tell me! Tell me! 
'God, my husband drinks too much.' - What? 
What? What? 
Patience! Slow down! Slowly! - Hey, God, my.. - What? 
What happened to my.. - What? - My God.. 
What are you asking for, I don't understand anything. 
Hey stop. 
Enough! Stop! Silence! Silence! 
In this world people don't have any other work besides asking! 
My children, I don't understand anything. 
Please say it one by one. What do you want? - Madhuri Dixit. 
Somebody else's wife! Is this something to ask for? 
You tell me! - 'Oh God, make me a dog.' 
Hang on! One second! 
One by one! One by one! One by one! 
I don't have time to hear all that! 
In this world people should get whatever they want.. 
..what can be better than this? 
My happiness lies in their happiness. 
So I accept everybody's wishes! 
I accept it! I accept it! 
You have blessed this world! 
Sir! - Yes! 
God heard your prayer! - Yes! 
Look, sir gave me the bike's key. - Is that so? 
Now give a ride to your children. 
And listen, bring sweets on your way back. - Yes! Yes! 
Saw that! Solace! Contentment! 
Satisfaction! 
What will you understand? 
God bless you! 
Today you came to meet us. 
Now quickly come in this house forever. 
Listen, she is my sister. She is elder to you. 
Her name is MP. Touch her feet. 
You made her touch your mother's feet, your sister's feet! 
Now make her touch the neighbour's feet! 
But don't make her touch your father's feet! 
Have patience! Have patience! She will touch it! 
He is my father, touch his feet. 
God bless you! Hang on! 
May God make you both stars of channel! 
If there is any problem, come to me! 
I still have contacts in municipality! 
I will get you a job there! Okay! 
Look at this! - Dear, this is the wedding veil for you. 
Wear it on the wedding day. God will bless both of you. 
Madam! - Look!

I will buy a car! 
My child will go to convent school! 
And I will give him foreign brand liquor! Dagdu! 
What do you say, Dagdu? 
If I invite you people to my new house for lunch..

We will come, Gangubai! We will surely come! 
Fine! Now I will leave! I have so much work to do! Fine! 
Listen! If you keep a new maid then find one for me too! 
What is she saying? - Dagdu, wait. - Saw that, son? 
For years we were craving for our wealth! 
She found her wealth! And I got mine! 
"The moon is hiding." 
"The stars feel shy." 
"Look at the damsel's face." 
"The sky bowed down." 
"Time came to a standstill." 
"Look at the damsel's face." 
"Since the time I wore the red veil of my beloved." 
"Since the time I wore the red veil of my beloved." 
"Since the time I wore the red veil of my beloved." 
"My beloved too says that I have become useless." 
"Since the time you wore the red veil of your beloved." 
"Since the time you wore the red veil of your beloved." 
"Your beloved too says that take it in your name." 
"Since the time I wore the red veil of my beloved." 
"I paid a heavy price for falling in love." 
"Friend, I couldn't make any excuse." 
"The bangle says. The bracelet says." 
"You have to go to your beloved's house." 
"Beloved, now who cares about the outcome of love?" 
"Your beloved too says that take it in your name." 
"Since the time I wore the red veil of my beloved." 
"Henna is being applied on the damsel's hands." 
"Bride looks so beautiful." 
"Moon is the guest.. stars are the guest.." 
"We have become companions for life!" 
"Now my days are fortunate!" 
"My darling has started saying, I have turned useless!" 
"Since you have immersed in the colour of the beloved!" 
You are feeling bad about going back! 
Yes! I am feeling bad! 
It was good power. 
But no matter! 
I have done my work in 10 days! 
Just wait for tomorrow! 
Tomorrow will be a unique day! 
From tomorrow, no one will be sad, worried! 
Because tomorrow, everyone will have everything.. 
..and everyone will be very happy! 
And they will thank only you! 
Because only you get the credit! 
Fine! I will see it too! 
What tomorrow brings to the world! 
Hey! Stay quiet. Don't shout. 
What are you doing? 
He has turned into a dog, sir! 
He has bitten four people since morning! 
We are taking him to the mental asylum! 
Come on, lift it. 
Dajju! Dajju! 
It's me, AP! 
Pick him up! 
Careful. Careful. 
Move back! Move back! Move back! 
What have you done, AP? 
You've ruined him by accepting his prayers. 
Alia, thank God. Sorry. 
I know it was so important. 
Manoj.. 
Has Alia arrived! - No, she still hasn't come! 
She isn't at home. She isn't here. Then where did she go? 
AP, you know what has happened? 
An explosion! 
The boss has thrown Chandani out.. 
..and now his secretary Rajesh has become the boss! 
I know that fool very well! 
He would always wish to God to make him the boss! 
And there, God heeded to him! 
The fool became the boss! 
I cannot understand anything! 
Oh, so you are saying my dialogue to me! 
No! There is no need to understand anything! 
Know only one thing! 
I am the boss here now, and you.. 
You are nothing here now! 
Has this happened because of me! 
No! No chance! 
What? - When did this happen? 
Oh! Oh! 
What happened? 
That Murari! - Yes! 
The boss gave him a bike yesterday! - Yes! 
On that happy note, he was driving the bike drunk.. 
..and that too without a license! 
An old man came in front of him and.. 
The old man died and Murari was jailed! 
He will be sentenced for life! 
God is so strange! 
He was happy without the bike! 
Now that He wanted to get someone killed by him.. 
I didn't think trying to do good for one will be bad for the other. 
If one or two have become bad.. 
..then at least the whole world should get their wishes. 
Monty, I can't believe this. - What happened? 
AP, all the horses won in the racecourse. 
What?! 
Oh, no! - What happened? 
AP, all the students have stood first in the examination! 
There is a uproar in the college for admission! 
And the college principal has locked himself in the bathroom! 
Let's go to Thane. - What happened now? Where are you all going? 
The government has given the order.. 
..to release all the prisoners! 
Don't know what all crimes they will do. 
Hurry up! - It's happened because of me! 
Yes, mother! - Son, there is a very big problem! 
What happened? 
Come home quickly, then I will tell you! 
You are needlessly giving me a heart attack! 
Its urgent. - Fine, I am coming! 
I am ruined. 
What had I done to you, that you did this to me! 
Why did you do this with me? 
Why did you do it, sir? 
What has happened to you? Why are you crying? 
I am ruined, sir! 
Gangubai, yesterday you won a lottery worth two crores! 
He ran away with all of it, the fool! - Who? 
My husband, Dagdu! - Dagdu! 
He ran away with the money.. 
..and my neighbour, the vegetable seller! 
What about my children now, sir? 
What about my children now? 
O Lord, I was better of without the money! 
Why did you give me the money? Why? 
Chaos! 
Look what's happening in the world? 
There is going to be chaos in the world! 
And it has already come in our world! - You please keep quiet. 
Son, a terrible thing has happened! - What happened? 
Madhu has eloped from home.. 
..and she has left this letter! 
What's written in it? - That she is getting married! 
She used to sit quietly in the house.. 
..when she was ugly! 
By making her beautiful, you have tarnished.. 
..our family honour! 
And she has run away! - No! 
Whom did you marry? 
Me. 
Fool, you! 
Behave with him! 
He is my husband, and your brother-in-law! 
He won't understand anything properly! 
Hey! - Hey fool! 
You dare abuse me! - No! No! 
What did you do with my sister? 
I didn't do anything! 
How did she marry you? 
She has become so gorgeous! 
Since I have seen her, I wish for only one thing.. 
..that she marries me! 
God listened to me today! 
She came to me herself in the morning.. 
..and said, let's get married! - So we got married! 
Suicide! - Run away! 
Let it be, son! 
Now they are married! 
The God wanted that! 
What can we do? 
Mother, this is not God's wish. This is too much! 
It is good that the government has forgiven you. 
My son came back after 25 years. 
God, thank you so very much. Oh God, he escaped hanging. 
My son has gone thin. 
"Thorn pricked me! Beloved, dear.." 
Brother, it is not good to waste money. Stop it. 
Why isn't Alia picking her phone? 
Latest news.. latest news! 
Rabri Devi became prime minister! 
Snowfall in Rajasthan! Storm in Kashmir! 
Latest news.. latest news! 
Hello? - Hello, AP? 
Alia has called you to hotel Hyatt immediately. 
The whole world is in chaos and she's partying? 
Not partying; Alia is marrying. 
What? 
Marrying; whom? 
Keep it down. - Yes. 
'Alia?' 
What are you doing? 
Wedding, marriage; with me. 
Just yesterday you took my parents' blessing for wedding? 
And today you pulled away ground beneath my feet. 
I'm really sorry, AP. 
Rocky was even leaving the city for ever yesterday but.. 
And before going I thought to make a last try. 
I prayed to God that Alia accepts me. 
And yesterday when he proposed me.. 
..I could not refuse. 
I'm sorry, AP. 
You know, how upset Alia is with you? 
If she gets married to you, she's supposed to be upset. 
No, not for that. 
But because there was nobody.. 
..from Alia's side in this wedding. 
You don't worry, Alia. 
Older brother has come; he'll do your rituals. 
Shut up! 
Think once again, Alia. 
We make such a perfect couple. 
If you want then ask anyone. - Get off! 
Came to my wedding and misleading my bride? 
Priest, get started! Come, darling. 
'Come.. come, Be seated.' 
Alia.. 
Loot everyone! Loot! Nobody moves from their places. 
Remove their jewelry. Don't spare anyone. 
You rat, they've come, it's over; now you marry. 
Alia, he called these goons! 
Man, did any mad lizard bite me that I'll call them here! 
Don't spare anyone. You smarty! 
Why are you getting so scared? 
Why fleeing leaving the task? 
Come on, take everyone's belongings! 
'And take off the jewellery of that bride!' 
No, boss. Here's much tension, boss! 
You fool, what's the tension? 
Now the court has released us! Now, we rule over this place. 
Boss, this man does magic with his eyes. 
'He hits with eyes!' 
Who? - This.. 
This fellow!? - Yes. 
Does magic!? He's magician!? - Yes. 
I'll see to him right now! 
Boss.. boss, be careful. 
I see, so you are magician? 
Come on show me; show me your magic quickly. 
Come on, hurry up; or else I'll show you my magic. 
The bullet shot here and there ends your life. 
Snatched away power and started playing with me again? 
'History!' 
Beloved's wedding anniversary. 
And lover's death anniversary! 
Even Romeo was not so lucky! 
You want to see magic. Then shoot him. - Hey! 
Because of my magic the bullet will stop.. 
..just one inch away from his chest. 
Hey you! Neither I'm Spiderman.. 
..nor Superman and not even Rajnikant! 
You'll shoot and I'll be over! 
That you'll come to know after shooting. You shoot! 
'Hey you!' 
Alia, look he wants to make you widow on wedding day. 
You don't worry for Alia. 
As soon as you die, I'll make Alia a bride again. 
And I promise you; on our wedding anniversary.. 
..we'll certainly celebrate your death anniversary. 
What are you looking at? Shoot - Hey you! 
Hey, shoot! 
Beat the fools! 
Come on! 
Hey, where are you running? - Let go off me! 
Hey, let me hit you. 
Alia, come on, move from here. Hurry up! 
Hit these fools! 
You fool! You'll hit me? 
I'll kill you! 
Alia! 
Boss.. boss the girl is hit, boss! 
Let's flee from here, boss! - Yes, come. 
Alia.. 
Alia.. 
Alia.. 
I will not let this happen. 
I will not let this happen. 
I will not let this happen. 
I won't let this happen. No. 
No! No! 
No! 
Why are you shouting at me now? 
Did you see, how they killed my Alia? 
Not those goons; you killed my Alia. 
Because life and death is in your hands. 
Don't blame me now. You are responsible for Alia's death. 
I? Will I kill Alia? 
You accepted the prayers of the whole world. 
Because of that so much mess up.. 
..and destruction is happening. 
Because of that Alia lost her life. 
I was doing well to the world. 
How could I know, that will become.. 
..the reason of my Alia's death? 
For you only Alia died and you're crying so much. 
Think of this; for so many years thousands of my children.. 
..created by me are killing each other. How much I've cried. 
Greed, hatred, enmity; I didn't create these in this world. 
You people created. 
Neither I made bomb, arms, bullets; you people made. 
Glass of your old car gets broken; you shout at me. 
You broke and destroyed the beautiful world I had made. 
I made one world, you made hundreds of countries. 
Have you ever thought what I've gone through? 
And you? I gave you so much power. 
What's it that you couldn't have done? 
But you didn't use it in the right way. 
You had the power of God. 
But your heart and brain remained that of humans. 
You remained Arun Prajapati; not God. 
I have realized, that whatever you've given to.. 
..an individual, that much is well enough for him. 
One must stay happy with that. 
Only you can run this world; humans cannot. 
Forgive me. 
Okay, I forgive. 
The destruction that happened because of me.. 
Please set it all right. - That is the past. 
It's gone; it can't be set right. 
You are God; what's there that you can't do. 
Otherwise kill me as well. 
Because I won't be able to live with this load. 
Because of me Alia died. 
The city got doomed, the country got doomed. 
Please, God, do something. 
All right; I'll take the world 10 days back. 
The world will start again from the time I phoned you. 
But think about it; everything will become the same. 
Once again you'll be a zero man expelled from the channel. 
Alia wouldn't have met you. 
Your sister, will be like before. 
Everything will be the same. 
I agree. 
It'll be good for me. 
All right. 
Time is back there. Take this. 
This is not my blessing; it's mother's blessing. 
Always keep this tied around your neck. 
Mr. God. 
If I have to talk to you? - You call me, I'll hear. 
I hear everyone. 
And if I've to see you again? - I'm within every human. 
Only the will to see me is needed. 
Answer me! Lost job, broke the car! 
What do you intend to do now; break this house!? 
I know that you love me a lot. 
Say it. - Who told you this!? Buttering me!? 
Do you want to serve in the municipality? - No. 
Tell me one thing; when did you laugh the last time? 
Two months after retirement. 
When did you laugh the last time? 
That day you lost laughter, that day I too lost my laughter too. 
First you laugh and show me. 
You don't worry, son. 
We'll sell this Hawa Mahal of your mother.. 
..to some builder and start life all over again. 
Everything will be alright. 
No, papa. I will work there only. 
Last night I got humiliated a lot. 
I want back my repute. 
Welcome to the first episode of 'Jhoot Bole Kawwa Kaate.' 
Your friend, your host, Rocky. This is a lie detecting chair. 
Means the lie detecting machine. 
And today the chief minister of our state will dare to sit on this. 
Mr. Bholaram Sachha! 
Come, sir please.. please. 
Wait. 
I sacked him yesterday, he came again? 
Hello. - Gentleman, how come you are here? 
I want you to sit on this lie detecting machine first. 
Who is he? - Sir, he.. 
I'm here to make the game, not to play. 
I want to say that this chair is full of wires. 
It can give an electric shock; which can even.. 
..put the chief minister's life in danger. 
So don't you wish that Mr. Rocky.. 
..sits on this chair first? - Yes.. yes.. yes! 
The boy is right. 
I too will see how this machine works. - Yes, sir. 
Alia! - Yes, sir? - Go, go! - Yes, sir. 
Excuse me. Two minutes. Sorry. 
Rocky, Mr. Bholaram is also saying and now even.. 
..the people are saying. Please sit on the chair. 
Go! - But I'm the host of this show. 
If I sit on the chair then who will question me? - I. 
He? - Please, sit. 
Sorry. - He is doing the right thing. 
What is this fuss? 
Who had brought the gift for Alia that night? 
Hey, this is a personal matter between me and Alia. 
Who are you to ask that? 
No, Rocky; tell him that you had brought the gift. 
Yes, I had brought it. 
He is lying! 
Who had stolen my DVD in yesterday's launch party? 
Hey! I will beat you! 
I am from a good family! I hadn't committed a theft! 
Had you made the presentation that was shown yesterday? 
No, Salim Javed had made it! 
Of course, I had made it! 
Rocky, I can't believe you told me so many lies! 
Alia, trust me and not this chair! It's a machine! 
I'm the man who loves you! 
Shut up?! 
Lies and more lies! He can become a politician! 
Stop! 
By proving someone else to be a liar.. 
..you can't prove that you are truthful. 
You will have to answer a few of my questions. 
Go, sit on the chair. 
Have you ever loved anyone till now? 
No. 
He is telling a very cute lie! 
Is there a girl in your heart whom you love? 
No. 
He is telling a true lie! 
So you don't love me. - No. 
Liar! 
I didn't know that you would love a liar. 
Where has Rocky gone? I won't spare him! 
'I dwell in every human being. You just need the eyes to look.' 
Don't be upset with him. 
He was the angel who brought us together. 
Sir, what happened? 
Chandani, I got everything in life, but I never got true love. 
Sir, I didn't understand! You do have a wife, don't you? 
Oh, God. - I am talking about love. 
Well, I had a long chat with Arun Prajapati.. 
..now I would like to talk to you too for a minute. 
You do not know each other, still you are sitting together. 
I liked it. 
On seeing you sitting together, unity is strengthened. 
Strengthen unity in the world too. 
The world will become a more beautiful place. 
Love your self. Love people. 
And be happy. 
If you remain happy, we too will be happy. 
God is not great. 
He is great because of his believers; because of his devotees. 
So I will say that, humans, you are great. 
"Oh God." 
"Oh God." 
"Oh God." 
"Oh God." 
"Oh God. You are great." 
"Oh God. You are great." 
"Oh God. You are great." 
"Oh God. You are great."
