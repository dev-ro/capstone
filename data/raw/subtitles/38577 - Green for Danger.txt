[Man] To the assistant commissioner
of the police, Scotland Yard.
Sir, the amazing events
which I am reporting...
may be said to have begun...
on the evening
of August the 17th, 1944.
New paragraph.
A postman was cycling
up Heron's Hill...
on his way to deliver mail
at the hospital.
His name was Joseph Higgins.
I begin with him
because he was the first to die.
The hospital itself lay a mile away...
an Elizabethan manor
requisitioned and converted...
in the emergency of war.
Another new paragraph.
In the operating theatre that night...
there was a surgeon,
Mr. Eden...
Nurse Woods...
Nurse Sanson...
the, uh...
the theatre sister, Bates...
Nurse Linley...
and the anesthetist,
Dr. Barnes.
August the 17th, 1944.
By August the 22nd...
two of these people
would be dead...
and one of them a murderer.
[Bell Jingles]
What's up? Had a puncture?
No, that second doodlebug this afternoon
dropped right behind the post office...
just as I was askin'
if these were sorted out.
They were sorted out, all right.
So were we.
- That's the lot. Five. And a bill for Dr. Barnes.
- Might be a receipt.
[Chuckles] Might be.
I shall be late on duty. So long, Mac.
- Can't be in two places at once.
- Our old warden takes a different view.
- All right for darts Saturday, Joe?
- You bet. Have a quiet night.
- [Air Raid Siren Blaring]
- Some hopes.
[Man]
What is good morale?
Discipline and confidence,
the one dependent on the other.
I repeat:
Discipline and confidence.
And you cannot have confidence
without positive thinking...
be you students or nurses,
under bombardment or otherwise.
A small instance...
You may smile when I tell you
that one of my first acts...
when I took over this hospital
a month ago...
was to order the word "waste"
to be painted out from the refuse bins...
and instead to substitute
the word "salvage."
"Salvage."
A humble example of the difference
between positive and negative thinking.
[V-1 Passing Overhead]
An essential fact
in the building and maintenance of...
[V-1 Continues]
Morale.
[V-1 Continues]
[Radio: Woman Speaking]
Another of them coming.
Tried to race me on me bicycle.
- Bit late, aren't you, Joe?
- Yes.
- Doodlebug dropped right...
- [V-1 Stops]
[Radio: Woman Continues]... is only V-1.
It remains to be seen what other numbers...
- will be suffixed to the letter "V."
- [Explosion]
[Radio: Woman Continues]
As the desperate Churchill...
lies frantically to save his face...
London and the home counties are reeling
under the incessant fire of our terrible V-1.
This is Germany calling.
This is Germany calling.
There.
That's all, Sister.
I thought it wasn't
a diverticulum.
- Is he all right?
- Hasn't turned a hair.
- You all right, Nurse Linley?
- Yes, thank you, sir. Perfectly.
It's always a bit of an ordeal
the first time.
- Wonder where that doodlebug dropped.
- Somewhere near the village?
I hope it missed my house.
What a life.
- Well, it can't last forever.
- Nurses stand up to it awfully well.
So do the doctors, sir.
One can get used to anything in time.
Still, it must have been a bit of a change
for you too, sir, considering.
- Considering what?
- Your past.
- Mmm?
- Thank you.
I mean Harley Street...
Rolls-Royce, lovely ladies.
All, all are gone,
the old familiar faces.
They left their appendixes behind them.
- They were happy to be in the fashion.
- And even happier to be in your consulting room.
It's those eyes, of course.
The wounded stag look that no woman can resist.
- I...
- Woods.
Why aren't you tidying up?
There's plenty to do.
Yes, Sister.
Clear out the swabs
and get some fresh saline.
- There may be more casualties in.
- Yes, Sister.
- You look tired, Esther.
- Oh, I'm all right.
- I'll make you a cup of something
before you go to bed.
- Thank you.
- Sanson, will you take the patient back to the ward?
- Yes, Sister.
- Yes, Sister.
- [Barnes] I can see that. But after all...
I'm not being in the least unreasonable.
I naturally thought you'd go with me tomorrow.
Darling, it's just a tatty little hospital hop,
not a ball at the Dorchester.
- Does it matter who goes with whom?
- I suppose not, but...
I was about to add,
Eden had a nerve to ask you.
Surgeons quite often ask nurses
on informal occasions.
- I know, but...
- I don't suppose he thought twice about it.
- I wonder.
- Now you're being ridiculous.
- Am I?
- Not to say pompous.
- I'm being nothing of the kind.
- Must you shout?
You know, it's really amazing how you
always contrive to put me in the wrong.
Well, you seem to think you can even dictate
who I'm to go to a dance with.
I don't want to dictate to anybody.
I've none of the instincts of a dictator.
- Then why dictate?
- What is the matter with you these days, Freddi?
I simply took it for granted
you were going with me, that's all.
- I don't like being taken for granted.
- Well, we are supposed to be engaged.
You mean, we were.
- Is that remark intended to have any point?
- Yes. We can't go on like this.
Nurse Linley. As you have nothing to do here,
would you please move outside.
Dr. Barnes, I do hope you won't be long.
We've still a great deal of clearing up to do.
Don't know what's happened
to hospital discipline this evening.
[Eden]
Ready, Barney?
Let's hope that's all
for this evening.
Sorry, Sister.
Time for a hundred up before dinner.
- Coming?
- Yes. Right. I'll follow you down.
Get some rest, Nurse.
You're on night duty, aren't you?
- Yes, sir. I'm just going off for now.
- Good.
- Oh, uh, good night, Sister.
- Good night, Mr. Eden.
[Bell Ringing,
Faint, Growing Louder]
Casualties. Woods, you'll be needed
in casualty reception with Dr. Barnes.
I'll finish here.
[Man Narrating] And a little later
they brought in Joseph Higgins.
[Muttering, Moaning Softly]
- Well, Nurse?
- Uh, fractured tib and fib.
And he's had a quarter of morphia.
In shock too.
Got his name?
No. It's left blank.
- No identity disk?
- He couldn't have been wearing one.
We'll have to make room for him in St. Cath's.
Someone's sure to come forward.
- Tell Mr. Eden.
- Yes, sir.
[Moaning Continues]
Compound. Otherwise straightforward.
No internal injuries.
- You haven't cleaned him up, Nurse?
- No, sir.
He was still badly shocked
when they brought him in.
Quite right. They fixed him up with a splint.
It's best to leave him as he is for a while.
- X-ray first thing in the morning.
- Yes, sir.
Then we'll take him out to the theatre
and operate at 10:00. All right?
- Very good, sir.
- Good.
- Clean him up a bit now, but don't worry him.
- Yes, sir.
Had any more of those nightmares?
- No.
- Meaning yes, I suppose.
Why don't you take a leave?
I might later.
I'd sooner work now.
I suppose you were right
coming back here so soon after...
My dear, it isn't the best of atmospheres
for you, you know... constant reminders.
There are lots of jobs outside
where you'd be helping just as much.
- I want to carry on here.
- My dear, you're young.
You don't want to poison your life blaming
yourself for something which you couldn't help.
- I knew your mother, don't forget, and...
- Please.
All right.
[Moaning Softly]
Me helmet.
You never turned off the wireless.
- You never turned off...
- You poor thing.
[Moaning, Muttering]
Am I late, Esther? Sorry.
I fell asleep, and...
- What's the matter?
- Oh, hello, Freddi.
- You look completely out on your feet, dear.
- Yes, I am a bit.
Plenty of sleep, that's what you need.
Hop off now. I'll see to everything.
- Anyone to fix?
- Yes. Three stat, one S.O.S.
- It's all in the prescription book.
- I'll give them. Off you go.
- Thank you, Freddi. Good night.
- Good night. See you in the morning.
Aren't you going
to kiss me good night, Nurse?
Hello, Nurse.
Spare a cuppa for the poor old surgeon?
- Yes, I think so, sir.
- Wonderful. I'm parched.
- Busy night after all.
- You never know how it's going to be
with buzz bombs.
No. We shall all end up
with elephantiasis of the ears.
- [Vehicle Approaching]
- Isn't that one?
Mm-mmm.
Only a car.
- Thanks. How's Barney?
- All right, sir.
Did I detect a slight note of friction
in the theatre this evening?
- Saccharin?
- Of course.
- I like Barney.
- So do I, curiously enough.
Naturally,
since you're engaged.
- We're not.
- Hmm?
- Since when?
- This evening.
Oh, I am sorry.
What's the trouble? Or shouldn't I ask?
I suppose it's my fault.
When a woman says that,
it usually means she's convinced it isn't.
Well, I don't know. We always seem
to be getting on each other's nerves.
Well, nobody's nerves
are quite what they were.
Especially after being cooped up here
for years, working long hours...
under one sort of bombardment
or another.
- I suppose not.
- Not that I ever interfere in these things.
- Don't you?
- Anyway, I never admit it.
- What's the matter?
- I was just looking at you and thinking.
- What?
- That Barney must be an awful fool.
He's not. He's sweet.
- It is my fault, in a way.
- In what way?
Well, he's probably a better sort of person
than I am altogether, but he gets so possessive.
And he's firmly of the opinion that
there should be only one man in your life.
To wit, Barney.
- It wasn't that sort of quarrel.
- Wasn't it?
Not really.
[V-1 Passing Overhead]
That wasn't a car.
[V-1 Stops]
[Explosion]
That was near.
[Eden]
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.
[Man]
Look out!
[Groaning, Muttering]
It's cut out.
It's coming down.
Hear it?
It's gonna hit us!
It's all right. It's gone over.
You're quite safe.
I had just come into the ward
when he started.
[Moaning]
London under fire.
Terrible V-1!
Terrible V-1!
Churchill telling lies.
Telling lies to save...
- What is it?
- I don't know. Some sort of quotation.
- [Muttering Continues]
- Don't talk any more, old man.
Take it easy.
There's nothing to worry about.
You're going to sleep now.
Give him a sixth of morphia.
I'd just come to look for you, Mr. Eden,
about the operation tomorrow.
- I understand you want it at 10:00.
- That's right, Sister.
- Then I'll put back the cartilage until 11:00.
- Thank you, Sister.
- Good night, Mr. Eden.
- Good night, Sister.
[Higgins Moaning, Sobbing]
[Sobbing]
Oh, there you are, Esther.
Where have you been?
It must be awfully late.
- Freddi overslept or something.
- There's some cocoa for you. I'll heat it up.
- Please don't bother. I don't want anything.
- Esther.
Esther, what's the matter?
Mr. Eden wants me to leave here.
Well, he's very sensible.
You should never have come back.
- I can't go yet. I won't!
- Well, it's up to you.
Are you sure you're all right?
- He saw I was upset over Higgins.
- Higgins?
The postman.
The unidentified fracture.
I hadn't recognized him then, of course.
Not until I cleaned him up.
He was buried too, like she was.
They had to dig him out.
I couldn't help thinking of...
Higgins?
[Man Narrating]
And at 9:50, precisely...
Joseph Higgins was wheeled
to the operating theatre.
- [Barnes] How many cases left today?
- [Woods] Three, so far.
[Woods]
But the next's only removal of plaster.
I shall need a new oxygen cylinder, Nurse.
We nearly ran this one out last time.
- Very well, sir.
- Good morning, Nurse.
- Good morning, sir.
- How's the patient?
- I could do with a pint.
- That's the preoperative atropine.
- Thank you very much.
- We shan't keep you long.
There's no need to worry. It's only a small thing.
Hardly an operation at all.
- Dr. Barnes, ain't it?
- That's right.
You remember me? Joe Higgins?
- Yes. You're the postman.
- Thought you would.
You gonna do the anesthetic?
- Yes.
- You've got a nerve.
- All right?
- Perfectly.
- New cylinder, sir.
- All right. Shove it in.
Oh, Sister, I think
I'll give the anesthetic on the table.
Save time.
He's not the nervous type.
Very well.
Did you say you're giving
the anesthetic on the table?
- That's right.
- Mm-hmm.
Sanson!
- Bring the machine in, Woods.
- But...
- Do hurry!
- Yes, Sister.
- Sanson, you can bring the patient in right away.
- Yes, Sister.
Ah, well, as Churchill says...
"Man the guns, sweep the skies,
plow the fields and pull the trolley."
Who's that? Who's that?
- I know that voice. I've heard it before.
- What's the matter?
It's the patient, sir.
I think he's a bit excited.
- Shh. It's only one of the nurses.
- I've heard it before somewhere.
- I can't remember where I heard it.
- Don't worry now.
It'll all come back later.
- Nurse?
- Yes?
There's no danger, is there?
No, of course not.
No danger at all.
Now take it quite easily, old man.
Just relax.
Breathe quite normally.
That's right. Quite gently.
No hurry at all.
Don't like his color.
[Barnes] I've cut down the gas
and increased the oxygen.
Not responding.
Nothing but oxygen now.
Still not responding.
- Doesn't seem to be any obstruction?
- I'll slip an airway in to make sure.
- [Eden] All right?
- Yes.
- Still pure oxygen?
- Yes.
- He's stopped breathing.
- Artificial respiration?
- Yes.
- Adrenaline, Sister.
Intravenous Coramine, Nurse.
[Man Narrating] They took the necessary action.
They neglected nothing.
It made no difference.
Joseph Higgins was quite dead.
- There'll have to be an inquest, of course.
- [Eden] Quite.
Most unfortunate.
These things always create
such a mistaken impression outside.
Of course I'm not suggesting
anyone is in the least to blame.
Barnes, are you quite certain
that the tubes were uncrossed?
- Positive.
- You checked the machine?
- Of course.
- Hmm.
Well, I'm inclined to take the view
that the man was still suffering from shock.
These things are bound
to happen now and then...
when taking justifiable risks
in urgent cases.
- I'm afraid we can't tell the coroner that.
- Oh? Why not?
- Because this case wasn't particularly urgent.
- Oh.
And there wasn't any risk.
The patient was perfectly fit.
Should've taken the anesthetic
without turning a hair.
Well, the fact remains he didn't.
This would have to happen in my very first
month here. It's most distressing.
- Any views, Purdy?
- Well, of course I wasn't there.
But it certainly seems
a bit strange.
- Might get a clue from the postmortem.
- Clue?
Oh, I see what you mean.
Well, we shall soon know.
No doubt it'll all straighten itself out.
- Thank you, gentlemen.
I don't think I need keep you.
- Thank you, sir.
By the way, I don't see that this
need be any reason for canceling...
tonight's little gathering.
- It started some time ago.
- Hmm?
- Oh, quite.
- ~ [Swing]
Well, it makes a break for the nurses.
Helps morale.
- I might even look in a little later myself.
- That'll be nice.
Dr. Barnes, would you mind
staying behind a moment.
- [Laughing, Chattering]
- ~ [Swing Continues]
- I'll see you at the party.
- Right.
He spoke of our little gathering
as though it needed lancing.
Most distressing.
"Quite. Oh, quite."
[Chuckling]
Barnes, you were in practice in this district
before joining the hospital, I believe.
- I was.
- Yes. [Clears Throat]
Frankly, I'm told this won't be the first inquest
of its kind you've had to attend at Heron's Park.
- That's true. The other was four years ago.
- Yes.
- Just a little unfortunate.
- I don't know what you're implying.
- The surgeon and I were both exonerated.
- Obviously.
I'm not suggesting for a moment...
Natural causes, cardiac failure...
it might happen to any of us.
- The fact remains, people talked.
- They generally do.
- They will, in this case.
- Let them.
I don't know that we can take quite so...
[Chuckles] carefree a view.
- We have the hospital to think of now.
- I can see that. But, after all...
For instance, soon after you came here,
I believe an anonymous letter was received.
- From some illiterate half-wit.
- Beneath contempt, of course.
Still, candidly, I was rather hoping
for a gesture from you.
- Oh?
- It might... I merely throw out the suggestion.
It might simplify matters if you were to
discontinue your theatre duties pending...
You mean, admit responsibility
for Higgins's death?
- Good heavens, no!
- If I'm suspended, that's what it amounts to.
My dear fellow, I merely suggested that I was
hoping the gesture would come from you.
- Well, it won't.
- Now, listen, Barnes...
In fact, the only gesture I feel like making
is far from polite.
There's no necessity to be vulgar.
I'm sure my predecessor...
Under your predecessor,
this hospital had a magnificent record...
partly because
he backed his staff to the hilt.
- This is intolerable.
I ask for cooperation, and what do I get?
- You don't want cooperation.
What you want is a scapegoat
neatly trussed up as a convenient sacrifice...
in case anyone
starts throwing bricks at you.
- I... Really! I...
- Suspend me if you like!
If you do, I shall appeal.
Good night!
[Door Slams]
~ [Swing Continues]
~ [Ends]
Excuse me.
- Barney.
- Hello.
- I only just heard. What's happening?
- Everything.
I've bumped off a patient, insulted
the superintendent and practically been suspended.
- Large scotch.
- [Woman] Only small gins.
- Barney.
- Small gins. All right.
- Have you really been suspended?
- White's hinting at it.
- It wasn't your fault... No, thank you.
- That seems to be beside the point.
- Why didn't you come and tell me?
- After yesterday?
We both said a lot of things
we didn't mean.
Freddi...
Ladies and gentlemen, Paul Jones!
[People Chattering, Laughing]
- Freddi, do you mean...
- Come on, Freddi!
Barney.! Barney.! Barney!

- Come along, old man!
Come on!
[Laughing]
~ [Continues]
~ [Humming Along]
- ~ [Stops]
- [People Laughing]
~ [Mid-tempo Jazz]
Really, Dr. Barnes!
When you said just now
you didn't mean what you said yesterday...
- I didn't say that, exactly.
- Well, what?
Couldn't we forget the whole thing?
Oh, all right.
Are we back where we were before?
[Sighs]
I'm awfully fond of you, Barney.
You do believe that, don't you?
The mere thought of losing you
drives me absolutely dotty.
You haven't answered my question.
- Barney...
- It's not that I mean to be awkward.
I naturally like to know
where I stand.
If you want to boot me out,
well, boot me out and I'll... I'll go.
Well?
Please don't ask me now, Barney.
I'm all in a muddle.
I want to be quite sure.
- Please.
- All right.
Thought about
what I was saying last night?
Yes. I'm going against
the very best medical advice and staying here.
You remind me very much of your mother.
She wouldn't see reason either.
Now, why shouldn't we speak of her?
You won't get anywhere by
driving this thing into the back of your mind.
Get away, my dear. Bring it into the open
and do a good job of forgetting.
I mustn't forget ever.
She was desperately afraid of the bombing,
and I left her to face it alone.
- You can scarcely be blamed for that.
- I left her alone.
Listen, Esther.
Your mother was
the most possessive woman I've ever known.
Jealously, hysterically possessive.
- You've no right to say that.
- The truth isn't less true for being brutal.
You've a chance now
to live your own life. Take it.

Hello, Sister.
Having a good time?
- No.
- Oh.
Well, I don't feel exactly festive myself.
Have a drink.
- I've got one.
- Mmm.
They make what's called
a handsome couple, don't they?
Yes.
Well, I don't know about him.
That's where I have
the advantage over you.
- What?
- I do know about him.
All about him.
- You think I'm an awful fool, don't you?
- Why?
Oh, you know.
Everybody knows by now.
It's funny.
I do my work and keep my head.
I might be a machine,
but when it comes to him I...
- It's funny, isn't it?
- What about a dance?
He's sick of me...
and I'm sick of myself.
- Now, look...
- You're a fool too.
- You know that, don't you?
- We all have our off moments.
I saw him kissing her
in the ward last night.
What?
That hurt, didn't it?
Now you know how I feel.
I saw him. I saw the way he looked at her.
He's in love, as far as he ever can be.
If I were you,
I'd have a nice cup of cocoa and go to bed.
You know it's the truth.
If he wanted to marry her, do you think
she'd hesitate if you weren't here?
- Well, I am here.
- You won't be much longer.
- Not if he knows about it.
- What are you getting at?
You killed a girl, didn't you?
A few years ago in Heron's Park.
That's not true,
and I've had just about enough of it.
Now there's been another death,
and White's had you on the carpet.
- What's this got to do with Eden?
- You're in his way, that's all.
- You're imagining things.
- No, I'm not.
I'm seeing the truth.
You get like that.
You get to see people
like you never did before...
all the rotten things about them
you shut your eyes to once.
And that hurts,
and it's a comfort.
You're in his way.
Don't you see?
- What are you getting at?
- ~ [Ends]
- [Applause]
- You'll find out.

~ [Orchestra, Slow]
- I'm sorry it's come to this.
- What?
Spoiling your evening
having to dance with me.
- Don't be absurd.
- Do you think I don't know?
Now, Marion,
why can't you be sensible?
We neither of us ever pretended
it was serious.
It was all over months ago
and no harm done.
Except to me.
I've tried to be considerate,
but you won't let me.
Considerate?
You can't afford to be anything else.
- What do you mean?
- You see, I happen to know.
- Know what?
- Can't you guess?
I can't.
Do you really
want me to tell you? Here?
- What are you talking about? What is all this?
- [Applause]
- You know all right.
- ~ ["Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush"]
~ [Continues]
~ [Continues]
Listen, everybody!
I'm sorry to interrupt the dancing,
but I have an important announcement to make.
A patient called Higgins
died in the theatre this morning.
But it wasn't natural causes
and it wasn't an accident.
Shall I tell you what it was?
- Murder.
- [Gasping, Murmuring]
Yes, he was murdered!
I found out how it was done.
Oh, quite by accident,
but I found out.
- Sister...
- And, believe it or not, I know who did it!
Marion, please.
Think what you're doing.
And I've got something that'll prove it.
I know where it is, because I've hidden it.
I've hidden it, and I'm
the only one that knows where!
All right, but I suggest
you tell Dr. White all about it.
- Let me alone! I'll go where I please!
- [People Murmuring]
Get them going, Nurse.
- McCoy.
- Hello, Sister.
Could I have the key
to the operating theatre, please?
- I won't be long.
I'm just going back for a minute.
- Okay.

[Twig Snaps]
[Gasps]
What on earth is the matter
with you, Marion?
- For heaven's sake, what is it?
- There was someone following me.
- Don't be absurd.
- It was you.
- It was you!
- Marion!
Marion, come back!
Marion!
- ~ [Slow Jazz]
- [People Chattering, Laughing]
- Oh, I thought you were asleep.
- Uh, no. Not me. No.
Dr. Barnes wanted the theatre key.
Sister Bates took it
five minutes ago.
Sister Bates? Oh.
Very well. I'll tell him.
[Slam]

[Man Narrating]
It was early the next morning, the 19th...
that I myself, in person,
arrived on the scene.
[V-1 Passing Overhead]
[V-1 Stops]
[Explosion]
- Good morning. Could I have...
- Well?
Considering everything, yes.
- I have...
- What's wrong with you?
Hmm? Just the usual slight discomfort
after meals. Nothing...
I have an appointment with the superintendent.
Do you mind telling him I'm here?
- What name?
- Cockrill. Inspector Cockrill.
Yes, Scotland Yard, I'm afraid.
[Chuckles]
Sickening.
Dr. White, please.
- A terrible business, Inspector.
- Mmm. Frightful. Where's the body?
- In the theatre, just as it was found.
- Police surgeon there?
Yes. I do hope everything
can be arranged discreetly.
Shouldn't think so for a moment.
- Why not?
- Press.
- Do they have to be seen?
- Can't keep 'em out.
- Oh, dear.
- I don't mind. Always give me a good write-up.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
- Turning colder, don't you think?
- [Constable] Yes, sir.
- Hello, Hendricks.
- Morning, sir.
- Kiddies well?
- Fine.
- Good.
- Body's on the floor.
Well, Doctor, any views?
- Stabbed twice, of course.
- So I see.
Surgical knife found in second wound.
First in heart. Cause of death.
Took place 9:00 or 10:00 last night.
Couldn't put it any nearer.
You don't have to.
We know within 10 minutes.
Found these on the floor. Probably worn
by whoever did it and left behind.
Hmm. Any fingerprints?
Nice set of hers low down
on that cupboard door. Right hand.
Dr. White, could you assemble
all the people you mentioned at once.
- Somewhere private. I'd like to talk to them.
- Yes, Inspector.
[Sighs] I wish the man
would come and get it over.
[Woods] He's conducting a war of nerves.
That's what it is.
When I think of her lying there like that
and only a few minutes before she was alive...
That's enough, Freddi.
Why the devil is he only after five of us here?
That's what I want to know.
Because you are the only people who seem
to have been concerned with both murders.
- Simple, when you think of it, isn't it?
- This is Inspector Cockrill.
Mr. Eden, Dr. Barnes,
Nurse Woods, Sanson, Linley.
Delighted.
Inspector, you said both murders.
- Sister Bates and what's-his-name... Higgins.
- Who said Higgins was murdered?
Well, Sister Bates herself,
for one, last night.
- I understood you were there, Dr. Barnes.
- Yes, but I didn't realize that she knew...
- Didn't you?
- [Eden] What about the Higgins postmortem?
- [White] Completely negative.
- But why should anyone want to murder Higgins?
My dear young lady, how should I know?
I've only just got here.
I understand from Dr. White
that all of you were present when he died.
- Not Freddi.
- Except Nurse Linley.
[Chuckles]
Interesting trust count.
I beg your pardon.
Except Nurse Linley.
Who was, however, on duty on Higgins's ward
the whole of the night before.
Yes. So I was.
And all of you were at the party.
So there you are.
Are you implying
that one of us did it?
Well, it seems very likely.
Don't you think?
Inspector Cockrill, I can't help feeling
that there must be some innocent
explanation of this terrible business.
- Dr. White, please don't be fatuous.
- Really!
We are dealing with
two premeditated murders.
Can anyone tell me anything
they think I ought to know?
If so, now is the time.
Very well. Pause for 30 seconds
while you cook up your alibis.
Did you get us here
just to insult us?
No. I only like to strike
an informal note.
- Well?
- I've cooked mine up, Inspector.
- I hope it's good.
- [Laughs] Oh! Done to a turn.
Well, uh, I-I stayed here
for a few minutes after Sister ran out.
And then I went straight back
to our rooms in the coach house.
Uh, f-five minutes' walk.
- Anyone see you?
- I don't know.
Hmm. I'm sure
you can do better, Mr. Eden.
- I?
- With the exercise of a little imagination.
- You followed Sister Bates, I believe.
- Yes.
Did you catch her?
[Chuckles]
As if you'd tell me if you did.
I followed her out to the terrace,
but she'd disappeared.
I waited a moment or two, but she didn't show up,
so I went direct to the sister's room.
- What? Eden.
- [Cockrill] One moment, Dr. Barnes.
- Anyone see you?
- I shouldn't think so.
The invisible man.
[Chuckles] Thanks.
Nurse Sanson, your turn.
[Eden]
Is that necessary, Inspector?
She's not well, and like the rest of us
she's been up half the night.
There's nothing to tell.
I was just leaving when Sister Bates
stopped the gramophone and spoke to everyone.
- It upset me, rather. It was all, well...
- Highly embarrassing?
- Where did you go?
- Straight to the coach house.
- She was in bed when I got back.
- [Eden] Obviously she couldn't have done it.
Unless she was fully dressed under the bedclothes.
Then she might have had time.
That's preposterous.
Naturally.
Now, then, Dr. Barnes,
what about you?
- I went after Eden.
- Me?
Why? Because you thought he might be
the murderer suggested by the late Sister Bates?
That's a charming supposition.
[Chuckles]
Well?
- Thank you.
- What on earth are you suggesting, Barnes?
- Did you catch him up?
- No.
- What did you do then?
- Went for a walk.
- Where?
- In the garden.
- Why did you want the key
for the operating theatre?
- I didn't.
You told Sergeant McCoy last night
that Dr. Barnes wanted the key, didn't you?
- Yes.
- Why? You're not a theatre nurse, are you?
- No.
- Then why did you go to the theatre?
- Just a minute.
- She discovered the body, Inspector.
Some of our most celebrated criminals
have made a particular point of doing the same.
Sister Bates
said she'd hidden something.
I thought the theatre
was the most likely place.
- I see. Just feminine curiosity.
- Why not?
Not the desire to remove that something
before Sister Bates could use it...
to incriminate anyone...
Dr. Barnes, for instance?
- Or Mr. Eden.
- That's more like it.
You're positively excelling
yourself this morning, Barnes.
- You're the young lady's fiancé, I believe.
- I was.
- Do you agree with his use of the past tense?
- I couldn't agree more.
Ah.
Another punctured romance.
Well, it comes to this... all of you had time,
yet none of your stories is corroborated.
[Chuckles]
Perhaps we all did it!
I wonder if you realize
exactly the sort of person we're dealing with.
Let me tell you
how I think Sister Bates died.
She hurried into the operating theatre,
unlocked the cupboard...
stooped down to get the evidence
she had hidden there.
- What was it?
- I don't know... yet.
Then she heard something.
She turned and saw a figure standing in the dark,
masked and gowned and gloved.
I imagine she just stayed
where she was, staring.
Then the murderer came slowly
over to her and stabbed her...
dressed her in this soiled theatre gown...
and stabbed her again.
Through it, to make it look as if
she'd been killed wearing the gown.
- But why?
- [Cockrill] I don't know that either.
But what we do know is that
the second wound was made after death...
and that the murderer was in a hurry.
As you see,
he tore the gown somewhat.
Now, there's one other thing.
This bottle of tablets was taken
from the poison cupboard.
Dr. White has checked the contents,
and there are four missing.
- A lethal dose.
- The murderer has them
and will not hesitate to use them.
Four of you are in mortal danger
from the fifth.
Above all, don't trust your neighbor,
your roommate, your fiancé...
or your friend.
He or she may be the murderer.
Come instead...
to me.
Sister Bates died because she knew
something and was foolish enough to say so.
I beg of you...all of you...
not to make the same mistake.
[Screams]
I'm sorry.
[Sobbing]
[Laughing]
[Laughing Continues]
[Sobbing]
Thank you, Nurse Woods.
You showed great presence of mind.
- [Sobbing Continues]
- Take her back.
[Sobbing Continues]
- I shouldn't do that again if I were you, Inspector.
- Why not?
Because Nurse Sanson
is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
Actual or assumed?
Perhaps you would prefer
to judge that for yourself.
Three months ago her mother was buried
under the ruins of her house in a raid.
The rescue squad dug for her for three days
and then gave it up.
Next day she was found, still alive.
She died an hour later.
Esther was there the whole time.
I could scarcely be expected
to know that.
So, without bothering to inquire,
you scare the life out of her...
like any flat-footed copper off the beat.
The police force has not a monopoly
of fallen arches, Dr. Barnes.
Ask any chiropodist.
Thank you, Mr. Eden.
Before the war you had a house
in Heron's Park, I believe.
- Yes.
- And you had a practice in the district?
- I did.
- Good.
Well, then, Dr. Barnes, would you care
to accompany me to the theatre?
- You gave Higgins the anesthetic.
- What's that got to do with it?
That's what I'm hoping to find out.
Did you know him?
- Only by sight.
- Nurse Woods is a remarkable woman.
- Absolutely first-class.
- Ever live in Heron's Park?
Not so far as I know.
She used to live the other side of London.
- She took up nursing when her sister died.
- When?
1940, on the Continent.
- Funny.
- What is?
Oh, it's nothing. It's just that Higgins
thought he knew her voice. That's all.
Indeed.
Have you any views on nasal catarrh?
Nothing in particular. Why?
Just wondering.
I often suffer from it in the mornings.
[Blows]
That's the machine I used.
- I see.
- They brought Higgins in here.
I examined him.
He was quite fit. So we went ahead.
- In here?
- No. I gave it to him in the theatre.
- The coup de grâce?
- The anesthetic.
- Is that usual?
- Not really. It's up to me.
Naturally.
In that case, in we go.
I gave nitrous oxide at first
to get him under.
Oh, yes. The stuff the dentist
gives you, hmm?
Commonly known as laughing gas?
Used to be. Actually, the impurities
caused the laughs.
Oh. Just the same as our music halls.
Then I added oxygen.
When he failed to respond...
Doctor, my ignorance is simply staggering.
Please demonstrate.
Black and white, oxygen.
Black, nitrous oxide.
Green, carbon dioxide.
The rest are spares.
I began the nitrous oxide.
So.
The flowmeter registered correctly.
- [Gas Hissing]
- When I got him under, I added oxygen.
Like this.
I didn't like the look of him, so I cut down
the nitrous oxide and increased the oxygen.
To my surprise, he didn't respond.
So I turned off the nitrous oxide altogether,
put him on pure oxygen.
- And then?
- He simply collapsed.
I injected adrenaline, and Nurse Woods
gave Coramine as a last resort.
Nurse Woods. Hmm.
- Could these have been tampered with?
- I don't see how.
In any event, the damage
had been done before then.
- What about this fellow?
- Carbon dioxide?
- Mmm.
- We sometimes use a little to stimulate respiration.
- Isn't it poisonous?
- Without oxygen, yes.
- Use any in Higgins?
- None at all.
You couldn't have coupled up
the wrong cylinder by mistake?
These machines are as foolproof
as they can make them.
Besides, we checked everything.
It wouldn't be possible to fill, say,
an empty oxygen cylinder with carbon dioxide?
- Good heavens, no. It takes terrific pressure.
- Just supposing.
Well, the patient would be getting
carbon dioxide instead of oxygen.
He'd die of, well, lack of oxygen.
And you couldn't tell by the flowmeter
or the postmortem?
No. But the whole thing's quite ludicrous.
You must bear with me, Doctor.
I'm a child in these matters.
- Can I go now?
- No. I don't think so.
You had a similar experience
once before, didn't you?
- I suppose Dr. White's been talking.
- Incessantly.
It wasn't similar.
It was no comparison.
- And I made no mistake in either case.
- Splendid.
- Does Eden think that?
- Eden? What's he been saying?
Nothing to me.
You don't like him, do you?
If I discuss that with anybody,
it'll be with Eden.
Why not?
Confidentially,
do you think he did it?
How should I know?
Dr. Barnes.
About that anonymous letter.
If you're silly enough to attach
any importance to a thing like that...
Oh, it wasn't that exactly.
I was merely wondering if Higgins
was the postman who delivered it.
[Cockrill Narrating]
Yes, I was idiotically pleased with myself at the time.
But I am not so pleased
to think of it now...
because there was the vital evidence...
the clue to the whole business...
right under my nose.
If I had know then,
it might have saved another life.
The next morning my presence
lay over the hospital like a pall.
As I approached, voices were hushed...
and all eyes turned upon me.
Who was the guilty one?
When will he be arrested?
Who will be next?
[Chuckles]
That is what they were thinking.
I found it all tremendously enjoyable.
During the rest of that day
I continued my investigations...
with my accustomed energy.
Good afternoon, ladies.
[Chuckles]
No need to be alarmed.
We were only searching your rooms.
Well, I'll be...
- Did you know Higgins?
- Personally, no.
What precisely was your relationship
with Sister Bates?
Not exactly distant, I take it.
Harmless enough...
or so I thought.
Nevertheless, you certainly
had a motive for getting rid of her.
Only in her imagination.
She might have proved troublesome.
She was jealous and possessive.
Most women are if you give them
the slightest encouragement.
Which you invariably give them. Hmm?
[Chuckles]
Only sometimes not so slight.
- Are you trying to make me lose my temper?
- That was only a secondary object.
[Cockrill Narrating] From time to time,
one of those infernal devices roared overhead.
[V-1 Passing Overhead]
[V-1 Stops]
[Explosion]
But such trifles, of course, did not
for a moment distract me from my purpose.
Did Higgins say anything that night
that you think might help us?
- He'd only just got in when the bomb fell.
- He didn't speak again?
No. 'Cause I went clean out for a bit.
When I came round, all I could hear was the radio.
Hmm? The radio?
Yes. Our old wireless set.
Still hollering a treat it was too.
- Ah. What was it playing?
- Wasn't playing.
- Hmm?
- It was talking.
- What about?
- Well, uh, let me think.
Come along now.
Surely you can remember.
I can't get it out of my mind. When I woke up
today I didn't remember at first.
Then it all came back. I went to the window,
and there was the inspector slinking about outside.
He's probably lurking about
in the bushes at this very moment.
- Oughtn't we go back?
- Why?
- It's a lovely night.
- We're still suspects.
That's a very good thought
to escape from.
It's not easy.
- Have you seen Barney?
- No.
I don't know what to do about him.
Isn't it time you made up your mind?
He's behaving so ridiculously.
I don't blame him.
He's in love with you.
I don't blame him for that either.
It is a lovely night.
Perfect.
"In such a night as this...
"when the sweet wind
did gently kiss the trees...
"and they did make no noise...
"in such a night...
"Troilus methinks
mounted the Troyan walls...
"and sighed his soul
towards the Grecian tents...

[Cockrill]
"In such a night...
did young Lorenzo
swear he loved her well...
"stealing her soul
with many vows of faith...
and ne'er a true one."
Good night, Mr. Eden.
Good night, Dr. Barnes.
Nurse Woods.
Jane Woods.
Where she lived. When she came to London.
Everything you can find out.
Ring me right away. Bye.
[Sighs]
I must be getting old.
[Cockrill Narrating]
So much for the 19th.
The morning of the 20th
dawned like any other.
The condemned man
ate a hearty breakfast.
- Have some jam.
- No, thanks.
- You've eaten hardly anything.
- I've had quite enough.
- Besides, we ought to be going.
- Oh, we have 10 minutes yet.
- How about the washing up?
- I'll come back at 9:00 and do that.
Here's Freddi.
- Well, I wonder what today will bring.
- [Footsteps Approaching]
- No, it's not.
- What?
Freddi.
[Footsteps Approaching.]
Anyone in?
- Oh, hello.
- Good morning, sir.
- [Sighs]
- Good morning.
- I didn't startle you, did I?
- Oh, no, sir.
- I clumped to warn you.
- [Chuckles] He clumped.
I've been wandering around
for about an hour.
Thought I'd just drop in,
see if you were all all right.
- Well, we're still here, sir.
- Somewhat to our surprise.
- Have some tea.
- Nothing go bump in the night?
- Only my heart. Oh, stick the kettle on, Esther.
- No. Please don't bother.
It's gotta go on again for Freddi's
hot-water bottle. Her bedroom's freezing.
If you're looking for Freddi,
she's not back yet.
- Oh, no. Really. I wasn't. I just dropped in.
- [Door Opens]
Oh, here she is.
Hello, children.
It's parky for an August day.
I thought I'd see Nurse Linley home
and come in and see if you were all right.
- [Chuckles] Seems to be a popular movement.
- Well, I'll push off.
- Got a cup of tea?
- Esther's getting it.
Esther's not.
Not until someone gives me a shilling.
The gas has died on us.
Oh, dear. It's my turn, and I forgot.
Unless there's one in my bag.
Bobs for the love of Allah.
[Woods]
Heads.
- [Woods] Good gracious.
- Not a bob among us.
- That's funny.
- How about you, sir?
Nothing doing.
Freddi, my pet, you'll have to go to bed
with half a lukewarm water bottle.
- I could slip over and ask McCoy...
- Of course not. I'm too tired to care.
I hardly slept at all yesterday.
Who did?
None of us, I imagine.
Speaking as the life and soul of the party,
I just can't keep it up.
Oh, don't worry, darling.
You've been wonderful. Really you have.
It's this wondering and watching.
I don't believe it was one of us. It can't be, and...
and yet somebody must have killed him.
But why? Why Higgins?
I was thinking during the night
about that gown.
- What gown?
- The one Sister Bates was found in.
- What about it?
- Well, you know the hole in it
where she was stabbed?
- Mmm.
- I knew there was something that seemed wrong.
I know it sounds silly, but it suddenly
dawned on me what it was.
- [Sanson] What?
- [Linley] It was...
- Shut up.
If you've anything to tell,
tell it to the inspector.
Aren't you being a little fanciful?
I must say.
I can't see any harm in it.
- Oh, of course not.
- The inspector did say if we found out anything...
to go to him and not trust anyone.
He happens to be quite right.
- What's the matter with him?
- Doesn't your intuition stretch that far?
Well, it was only a thought I had.
When I wake up I expect it'll seem
too silly for words.
- Going to brush my teeth.
- I'll go and get your hot-water bottle.
Are you quite happy
about the way you're behaving?
Self-criticism has never been
one of my failings.
I hope you're not confusing Freddi
with the kind of woman...
who used to dither in and out of your consulting
room in a flutter of checks and eyelashes.
Ah. Those were the good old days.
I miss the checks.
[Footsteps Approaching]
She's a bit romantic
and not very experienced.
And like the rest of us, she's been under
a nervous strain for a long time.
- Well.
- I'd hate to see her giving up...
someone permanent like Barney and falling
for your practiced and rather hollow charm.
- You're much too kind.
- I'm serious.
- Supposing I were too?
- What?
Serious. I might be.
Oh, I think we better
keep this conversation practical.
- Have it your own way.
- Think it over.
My dear Nurse Woods...
who am I to make the course
of true love run any smoother?
All right. Only I warn you.
Barney won't bottle it up much longer.
Any moment now he'll grab the nearest
grandfather clock and break it over your head...
whereupon I for one will give
three rousing cheers...
sir.
Anything the matter?
- It appears I'm a menace.
- To whom?
- Unprotected females.
- Have you only just discovered that?
- Strictly speaking, no.
- Then why complain?
I'm not complaining.
- Ready, Woody?
- Here I come.
- Where have you been?
- Getting my cap.
- Come on. We ought to be there.
- Coming, sir?
In a minute. I think I ought to give
Barney a run for his money.
You have been warned.
- Bye-bye, Freddi. See you tonight.
- Bye-bye.
Get me Inspector Cockrill, will you?
What?
Well, see if you can find him,
and ring me back.
Everything's ready now, Sister.
Just going back to the coach house for
a few minutes to clear up. All right?
- Very well, Nurse. Only get back before 9:30.
- Yes, Sister.
[Gas Hissing]
[Ringing]
Dr. Barnes here.
Oh, thank you.
Is that Inspector Cockrill?
No, Doctor. It's Hendricks.
The inspector's busy at the moment.
Can I give him a message?
I wanted to talk to him.
Well, it's about Nurse Linley.
Yes. I think it might be important.
Tell him he can find me here
in casualty reception.
Thank you.
Dr. Barnes was asking for you, sir.
- What does he want?
- Said it was something about Nurse Linley.
- He's in casualty reception.
- Right. Let's go along.
[Hissing Continues]
Freddi!
Freddi?
[Glass Shattering]
Help!
Bring her down quick, Hendricks.
- Get Dr. White at once.
- Freddi.
You're not to touch her, Dr. Barnes.
Get Dr. White at once.
[Footsteps Approaching]
- How's Freddi?
- Still unconscious.
- Can I see her?
- No.
- But why not?
- Because I say so.
Well, the murderer has achieved
his first object.
- He or she has silenced Nurse Linley.
- Wha...
- At least for the time being.
- Could it possibly have been an accident?
The only accident was
that she survived.
Thanks to Nurse Sanson.
- However, it has simplified the problem.
- How?
The suspects are now reduced to four.
One, two, three, four. Fewer suspects and
less work for me. My ideal is a 40-hour week.
- For heaven's sake.
If you'd only come when I asked for you...
- Perhaps if you'd sent for me sooner.
- Left it a bit late, didn't you?
- How was I to know that?
Unless you yourself were the guilty party.
A just point, Dr. Barnes.
You all knew that
the gas had failed. Correct?
You all knew that
she'd gone upstairs to sleep.
You went up there alone
with a hot-water bottle.
You pointed out yourself
that Esther saved her life.
I exclude none of you
from this, Mr. Eden.
And you also slipped up there alone...
without a hot-water bottle.
Mr. Eden remained behind
when everyone else had gone...
and Dr. Barnes was within
easy distance across the yard.
Each one of you could have slipped
up to her room and turned on that tap.
You all knew Nurse Woods's habit of going back
at 9:15 to boil a kettle for washing up.
And of course, none knew that better
than Nurse Woods herself.
- You told me you'd never met Higgins.
- I hadn't.
Does Horton's Farm, a couple of miles
from Heron's Park mean anything to you?
- What?
- You lived there once, didn't you?
- Up to 15 years ago.
- Yes.
- As a matter of fact, I did.
- Why, Woody...
- Wait.
- With your mother and your sister.
Yes. Is there anything wrong in that?
- No, no. You're a theatre nurse, aren't you?
- Of course.
- With access to anesthetics and theatre gowns?
- I suppose so.
- Sister Bates was stabbed through a theatre gown.
- Yes.
Linley said she knew something about that
same gown... just before her life was attempted.
- [Woods] Well?
- And Higgins recognized your voice.
- He couldn't have done.
- He thought he did.
Do you know the last thing Higgins heard
as he lay in the debris of that rescue post?
- How should I know?
- Hendricks.
Listen,
and you'll hear what Higgins heard.
- What on earth?
- [Cockrill] Listen.
[Woods's Voice] Meanwhile, our attacks have
continued without a pause since June the 15th...
and have laid much of
the British capital in ruins.
As the desperate Churchill lies
frantically to save his face...
London and the home counties are reeling
under the incessant fire of our terrible V-1.
This is Germany calling.
This is Germany calling.
[Cockrill] A BBC monitor recording of a broadcast
from Hamburg on the evening of the 17th.
- Woody.
- [Cockrill] Scarcely that. Her sister.
- [Barnes] What?
- [Cockrill] Her twin sister,
if my information is correct.
- Am I right?
- [Phonograph: Man Speaking German]
[Clicks Off]
Yes. You're right.
[Cockrill]
You were very fond of your sister, weren't you?
Yes. And ashamed for her.
I tried to hide it.
I... I said she died in France in 1940.
- I'd have done anything.
- Including murder?
Murder? Well...
I had the motive, didn't I?
Higgins might have
put two and two together.
And I had the opportunity each time.
And I did go to Freddi's room alone,
and I did put the shilling in the meter.
Well? Why don't you all say
what you're thinking?
Why don't you tell them?
Why don't you tell them I did it?
Now, who on earth said you did?
Or didn't.
- Leave her.
- [Woods Sobbing]
The inspector has a charming aptitude
for traveling in ever decreasing circles...
which I fear can only have one end.
Someday, Mr. Eden,
I must try my hand at removing an appendix.
I fancy the progress will be slow...
until I discover what Nurse Linley
was going to say about that gown.
[Barnes]
She'll tell you that when she comes round.
Dr. Barnes, she may never come round.
- What do you mean?
- Her skull was fractured in her fall.
- [Eden] What?
- Come back.
- I must see her.
- I said come back.
- Why?
- It can't do any good.
- And I can't trust you.
- Yes, but...
Besides, I haven't finished.
There is pressure on her brain...
which I am told can only be relieved
by an operation...
if she's to live
and tell me what she knows.
- What? Trephining?
- [Cockrill] So Mr. Purdy says.
- That's very serious.
- The operation will take place
at 9:30 tomorrow morning.
All of you will undertake exactly the same
duties as you did in the case of Higgins.
What? You can't do that.
- You prefer not to give the anesthetic?
- I prefer not to see her killed.
The one doesn't necessarily follow
from the other.
Even if it did in the case of Higgins.
Nurse Woods, do you remember accurately
all that you did before?
- Yes. I think so.
- You're willing to do the same again?
- All right.
- Thank you. Nurse Sanson.
How about you? Are you willing to perform
precisely the same duties as you did before?
Yes. I suppose so.
May I point out that you can't exactly reproduce
the circumstances of Higgins's death...
which I presume is what you're after.
- Oh? Why not?
- Because I shan't be operating.
If you refuse,
I can only draw one conclusion.
In this case, the wrong one.
You see,
I don't happen to be a brain surgeon.
Very plausible, Mr. Eden. But if Mr. Purdy
operates, do you object to assisting him?
No.
- [Cockrill] Thank you.
- You're not gonna let him touch her.
- [Cockrill] Why not?
- May I remind you that Higgins died
before I could operate?
- What are you suggesting?
- Only that the chief danger seems to lie
in the giving of the anesthetic.
- You hinted that to Dr. White, didn't you?
- I did not. Why should I?
You had something to gain
if I had been forced to leave.
- Did? What?
- Freddi.
Now, who on earth gave you that idea?
Sister Bates, if you want to know...
just before she was killed.
Just before
you met her in the garden.
- Mr. Eden...
- Inspector.
Pardon me interrupting, gentlemen,
but did you meet Sister Bates in the garden?
- Yes.
- And you never told me.
I saw no point in making things more difficult
for myself than they already were.
- Do you expect him to believe that?
- He might prefer the truth...
to your jealous suspicions.
Hendricks. Don't interfere.
Well, well, well.
A master of surgery
mixing it with an L.R.C.P.
[Chuckles]
What a delicious spectacle.
We might arrange a future contest in aid of
some deserving charity. Don't you think?
[Chuckles]
Perhaps the police orphanage, Inspector.
[Laughing]
Well, I suppose I ought to be glad that
my suspects haven't been reduced still further.
And I take it we shall all meet tomorrow
morning in the operating theatre at 9:30.
I shall ask Dr. White to make
the necessary arrangements.
It ought to be quite dramatic.
Well? How's Nurse Linley?
- Oh, much better, thank you.
- Pulse and temperature back to normal.
Splendid. You've had
a very narrow escape, young lady.
- Yes.
- Have you told them all?
I have indeed. I have convinced them
that Nurse Linley is at death's door.
They have agreed to cooperate.
Do you seriously intend to go through
with this fantastic scheme?
- I do indeed.
- Well, I suggest that...
Well, Mr. Purdy.
Are you word perfect?
Oh, I think so. Depressed fracture
of the occiput necessitating craniotomy.
Really? Even to say that's
an achievement.
What about Mr. Eden? As your assistant,
would he expect to examine Nurse Linley?
Uh, no. Not necessarily. No.
I'll show him these X-rays.
Prewar patient of mine.
Uh... Oh.
Ah.
- Very nice fracture.
- Recover?
- Oh, yes.
- Remarkable.
Surely no one in their senses
would make another attempt.
Not in their senses, certainly.
But it must have occurred to you that
we are dealing with an unbalanced mind.
A one-track mind that can see things only
one way. In every other aspect as sane as I am.
Or even as you are, Dr. White.
Possibly. You think what happened
before will happen again.
I think they'll try.
- Well, I wash my hands of the whole business.
- You couldn't do better.
- And, Nurse Linley.
- Yes?
I've explained to you
the risk that you'll be running...
but if you wish to change your mind now,
I'll quite understand.
No. I've thought it over,
and I'll do as you tell me.
Thank you. I'm very grateful.
Meanwhile, absolute secrecy.
- I know.
- Till tomorrow, is there anything I can do for you?
- Well, could I see someone?
- Who? Mr. Eden?
- No. Dr. Barnes.
- Dr. Barnes.
Well, his style is less polished,
but his footwork is superior.
- Hmm?
- [Chuckles] Never mind.
No, my dear. I'm afraid you can't see him.
There can be no exceptions.
- Still willing?
- Of course.
- Good.
- [White] This is absolute lunacy.
I disagree.
You see, I think I know who did it.
[Door Opens, Closes]
[White] Twenty past.
They'll be bringing her in any minute.
[Cockrill]
Dr. Barnes.
Now, is everything laid out
exactly as it was before?
[Barnes]
All correct.
- [Cockrill] You're quite satisfied?
- [Barnes] Yes.
- Right. Take the whole lot back again, Sister.
- What? Now, sir?
- Yes. Now.
Change every single item with a fresh one.
- What's the idea?
We can't be too careful. Can we?
Oh. Allow me.
- This is indeed an honor, sir.
- Nervous?
- Paralytic.
- You don't look it.
- Did you do this last time?
- Yes.
It's a new oxygen cylinder.
- Do you think anything will happen?
- Oh, yes. I think so.
- Well, in that case...
- What's this?
- Lubricant for the airway tube.
- Change it.
- Where's Eden?
- On his way, I hope.
- All right?
- [Hendricks] Yes, sir.
Good. Watch her.
- Freddi.
- No nearer. Please, Doctor.
[Cockrill]
Ah. There you are, Mr. Eden.
We're nearly ready.
Nurse Sanson, will you bring in the patient?
Yes, sir.
- Are you ready, Doctor?
- [Barnes] Yes.
Oh, Dr. Barnes. I believe I know why
you gave Higgins the anesthetic on the table.
Why?
Because you wanted witnesses.
Hmm?
[Gas Hissing]
All right.
[Cockrill]
Right. Go ahead.
- [White] Nitrous oxide.
- [Cockrill] Hmm.
Now for the oxygen.
Oxygen.
[Cockrill]
Is she all right?
[White]
Her color.
More oxygen.
- She's not responding.
- More oxygen.
She's collapsing.
Don't give her any more.
- Cut off the anesthetic.
- She's not getting any.
It's pure oxygen.
She must have oxygen.
- Cut it off!
- I can't.
- Cut off the oxygen!
- [Eden] What's the idea?
- [Cockrill] Purdy!
- [Purdy] All right. All right.
[Cockrill]
Purdy. The spare oxygen. Can you change it?
Yes. Here.
[Hissing]
[Barnes]
Right.
She's responding now.
[White]
She'll be all right.
- Inspector, I'm completely bewildered.
- [Cockrill] Give me a pair of scissors.
[Eden]
Green.
Yes.
Green for carbon dioxide.
You've been pumping CO² into her.
- [Barnes] And Higgins?
- Precisely.
A green cylinder repainted
black and white in each case.
- Does that suggest anything to you?
- What?
The salvage bins you've been having
repainted... also in black and white.
- Good heavens!
- Mmm. That's where they got the paint.
- [Linley Moaning]
- She's coming round.
Freddi.
If I were you, I'd walk her about the theatre for
a bit. The poor girl must be feeling the strain.
- What?
- With a fractured skull?
It may possibly disappoint you to learn that the
young lady's cranium is at least as sound as yours.
Hello, Barney.
It's all right. You're safe.
Yes. Her life
is no longer in any danger.
But of course, she told me yesterday
what she was going to say about that gown.
What was it?
She said the hole
the knife made was too big.
Almost as if something had been cut out.
She was quite right.
- Something had been cut out?
- Of course.
But I couldn't
for the life of me think what.
Until just now, when I noticed this smear
of black paint on Nurse Woods's gown.
Nurse Woods, have you any idea what it was
that Sister Bates had hidden in this theatre?
- No.
- It was this.
Thought you might know,
because it happens to be your gown.
- Mine?
- Mmm. The one you wore last time,
when Higgins died.
And look. Just here...
curiously enough, there used to be another
smear of black paint from the first cylinder.
- The one that killed Higgins.
- [Barnes] And Sister Bates spotted it.
And jumped to the right conclusion.
You see, one thing the murderer couldn't control
was the time the paint took to dry: About 12 hours.
But why dress Sister Bates up in the thing
and stab her again?
To distract attention from the tear
where the paint had been...
by sticking the knife... through it.
It's all right.
Do you think I could sit down?
Of course, Nurse Sanson.
Yes. It must have been
a terrifying moment for the murderer...
alone here in this theatre
with Sister Bates dead at his feet.
In the moonlight,
with the wind screeching outside...
and the window slamming
and opening.
Slamming and opening...
with the gown clutched
in the dead woman's hand...
with its telltale streak of paint...
and time pressing...
so that any action was better than none
and first thoughts had to be best.
- Can't you see it?
- For heaven's sake, come to the point.
Ah, but that is the point. Time.
Each of you had a motive for killing Higgins
after you'd recognized him...
but which of you had time?
Was there someone you thought
would be incriminated...
if Nurse Linley had been allowed
to speak yesterday?
- I don't understand you.
- I think you do. Who was it?
I don't know. Nobody.
- I can't tell you anything. I don't...
- Can't you leave her alone?
- I told you before. She's in no state...
- Why, on the day before Higgins's death,
did Mr. Eden urge you to leave this hospital?
I don't know.
Because this was the worst possible place for her.
I've explained that before.
I warn you. She's in no condition to be questioned,
and you can place no reliance on her answers.
Oh, can't I, Mr. Eden?
That's most illuminating.
What time did you leave the ward after
examining Higgins the night before he died?
- What's that got to do with it?
- Answer my question.
- About 10:30.
- Where did you go?
- Back to my room.
- Did you pass the paint store on the way?
Probably.
What became of those tablets
that were taken from the poison cupboard?
How should I know?
- Nurse Linley, do you feel well enough to talk?
- Yes.
- If I can help.
- Now please think very carefully.
What time did you go on duty
on the night before Higgins died?
I was a bit late.
About five past 10:00.
Whereupon, presumably,
Nurse Sanson left.
- Yes. As soon as I got there.
- Say about 10:10.
What time did Nurse Sanson
reach your quarters?
It was late, wasn't it?
- Yes. She said Freddi had overslept.
- What time was it?
Oh, well, uh, quarter to 11:00.
But... But I'm sure she...
Thank you. It should have taken you
five minutes, yet it took you nearly 40. Why?
- I don't know. I didn't feel very well.
- Did you pass the paint store?
[Sanson]
Yes. I suppose I did.
[Cockrill] Did you see anyone or anything
in there that made you pause or stop?
- [Sanson] I can't remember.
- Try. Was the door open?
- It may have been.
- Was there a light on inside?
- I don't know. I can't remember.
- Did you see anyone or anything in there?
[Shouts]
Did you?
- Or were you there alone?
- Can't you see she's had enough?
I've warned you, Inspector.
Mr. Eden, why do you keep on interrupting?
Are you afraid of something she might say?
- I've given you my reasons.
- [Cockrill] This time I'd like the truth.
- May I speak to her alone?
- No! Are you going to answer me, Mr. Eden?
[Cockrill]
Stop him!
Eden! Eden, open this door!
[Banging]
Eden!
I'm sorry, Esther. I've got to.
Look out!
[White]
Eden!
Esther Sanson, I arrest you for the willful murder
of Joseph Higgins and Marion Bates...
and for the attempted murder
of Frederica Linley.
I must warn you that anything you say
may be used in evidence.
- Esther.
- What?
- It can't be.
- [Cockrill] It is.
- Eden.
- It's not true. How could it be?
- She got me out of my room when the gas...
- Oh, yes. She intended to make a dramatic rescue.
Just too late.
But she arrived back a bit too early.
Then she saw me approaching,
smashed the window and dragged you out.
- And saved my life.
- And contrived to let you fall
headlong down the stairs.
By that time she had to be content
with second best.
Esther. You didn't do it, did you?
I did.
You knew, didn't you?
I was almost certain,
but I didn't know how.
[Barnes] But why should she want to
kill Higgins? What had he done?
- Tell them.
- Higgins was head of the rescue squad
that left her mother to die.
- [Woods] What?
- That was how it seemed to her.
They had no choice,
but she couldn't see it that way.
She transferred
her obsession of guilt to Higgins...
the blame she attached to herself
for leaving her mother alone.
By punishing him,
she was relieving herself.
I don't understand that.
I was quite right, of course.
Could I have a drink of water, please?
- Purdy.
- But Freddi and Sister Bates.
Yes. That was bad.
But I couldn't let them talk...
otherwise I should have been found out
and punished for something that was right.
- Esther, I'm sorry.
- You understand, don't you?
Water, quick. She's fainted.
She's dead.
What?
She can't be dead.
She can't be dead.
- Can't you do something?
- It's too late.
- Mr. Eden, you have deliberately
connived in her death.
- Have I? How?
You followed her in here
with that hypodermic.
- Quite true.
- There is a penalty for helping a criminal
to evade the consequences.
Aren't you being a little rash?
You don't know yet how she died.
- Well?
- Have you forgotten those tablets?
I have not.
And neither, I imagine, did you forget them.
They killed Esther.
A lethal dose self-administered.
- Self? Then what...
- When I realized it must be Esther...
I knew she was definitely insane
and that she had the tablets.
I wanted to be ready, but you came over to me,
and I was too late to stop her.
Yes, Inspector.
That was the antidote.
Antidote?
- Then wha...
- And you knocked it out of my hand.
I...
[Cockrill Narrating]
When I took my departure that evening...
it was not with the feeling that this had been
one of my more successful investigations.
In fact, it still seems to me
that I fell down rather badly on the case.
[Engine Approaching]
[Engine Stops]
[Cockrill Narrating]
And in view of my failure...
Mmm. Correction...
comparative failure...
I feel I have no alternative, sir,
but to offer you my resignation...
[Typing]
In the confident hope
that you will not...
accept it.
- [Typewriter Bell Dings]
- Full stop.
