Are you from the PKK?
No, l'm from Ankara.
Are you Kurdish?
No, Circassian.
What organization?
lt's called Þatýroðullarý .
l asked you what organization!
Don't play dumb with me.
l'm not. l was born dumb.
l have no organization. l wouldn't
join anyone who would have me.
An organization left to lbrahim
would count for nothing.
Why did you desert the army?
l didn't. l was transferred.
l had three days' leave.
l thought l'd visit lstanbul for two
days and on the third. . .
l would give myself up for duty.
You give yourself up to the police,
not to the army. You join the army.
How come you haven't done
your military service at this age?
lt never came up.
What never came up?
Kismet.
You've been evading military service
for 1 6 years, dammit!
Yes, dammit.
Watch your mouth
or l'll smack you into the wall.
How dare you say dammit
to my face, dammit!
lf l can't say it to you,
then you can't say it to me.
l hate the word dammit!
No one can say dammit to me.
That's why l stabbed
my brother in law.
Good, so you're also a murderer?
Nope! He's got nine lives
l couldn't do shit to him.
l see. . .we'll get to that later.
After running away for 1 6 years. . .
Why did you join the military?
Kismet
What kismet?
You were apprehended as a fugitive. . .
. . .and taken to Burdur
by the gendarmerie.
lt was that jerk of a brother in law.
He turned me in.
How'd you evade the military
for 1 6 years? Who helped you?
Nobody. When l was younger,
the recruiting office relocated. . .
. . .and some files disappeared.
No one came for me for 1 6 years.
Why didn't you go and ask
why they hadn't summoned you?
lf you wanted to serve, you'd ask.
l went, l asked. . .
l was going to go to Germany,
so l needed a paper for a passport.
l went to the recruiting office.
They said l had no file there.
Then this scribe there, lbrahim, told
me that my files were lost because. . .
of relocation. lf you want,
you can just drop it, he said.
Fuck it man, just drop it.
You will bring your, identity papers.
You will bring your residence papers.
You will have a new file, dammit!
Mr. lnspector, l don't know
if you ran to your military service. . .
but no one l know ever did.
l thought l would do a little work
first, but then the work went on.
Here you go.
l never said l wouldn't go, dammit!
Say dammit again and
l'll smack you!
Then you shouldn't say it either, or
l can smack you. My name's lbrahim.
Ex cuse me, sir, this fellow is under
stress and not ready for questioning.
With your leave, l can relax him with
some neurosurgery or endocrinology.
No, it won't do.
Had you planned anything for the next
two days? Who gives you orders?
What activity are you
talking about?
Why did you run at
the bus station?
They were checking
l D papers. . .
l thought my military status
might be a problem. So l ran.
Hey you! Wait! Stop! Stop!
Do you have a covert mission
in the army?
Are you kidding? There's no time for
that. l have guard duty 13; 35; 57.
l get all the night shifts. That
Captain Cemalettin can't stand me.
And why is that?
l head butted him for
saying dammit to me.
So you're a trouble maker,
stabbing and head butting.
No, Captain. . . l mean, no, sir.
l'm a meek and gentle man.
l just get pissed off
when people say dammit.
Were there any other soldiers
with you on the bus from Burdur?
Nope. No one else had
business in lstanbul.
They had no business in lstanbul,
but you did, right?
Who are they?
The others.
Others, eh?
So you're organized?
Yeah.
Good, good. This is sweet talk,
lbrahim. Who's your leader?
Colonel Niyazi.
So, the colonel's in on it, too?
So now he's singing, boss.
What's your organization called?
The Turkish Army.
Are you kidding around with me,
dammit?
No, dammit! l'm answering you.
l am with the mighty Turkish army.
Look at me, lbrahim. We have
hygienic torture instruments here.
We've seen guys like you. You'll
sing when you're on the machine.
What machine?
The singing machine.
But naturally l'm against torture.
People shouldn't do such things.
But we don't do anything, sir.
The machine is automatic. . .
it works by itself. lf there's
any shame, it's the machine's.
So, tell me everything nicely. . .
. . .and we won't have to hang you
on the ceiling from your dick.
Why did you go to that house?
ls it your headquarters?
What headquarters? lt's Muzaffer's
house. He's a buddy of mine.
Muzaffer doesn't know you?
What do you mean? lf he doesn't
know me, why was l at his house?
Sir, may l have a cigarette?
No.
So in that case, let's take a break.
This questioning has gone on forever.
l've definitely got to
smoke a cigarette.
Bring Muzaffer in.
Muzaffer is here too?
Sure he is. Now we'll see
if you know him or not.
So if he's been here all this time,
why didn't you bring him in before?
Have him brought in,
let's make peace and get it over with.
Hey Muzaffer, where were you?
Who's this?
l don't know this guy.
ls this some sort of trick?
What are you on about, Muzo?
He must have found out my name
from someone. l don't want trouble.
Hellooo, Muzo!
Aren't l your blood brother?
Aren't l always over at your place?
No, no. l don't know him.
l want to talk to my lawyer.
How can you not know me, Muzo?
Do you know this man?
l said no! What do you want?
Are you going to pin
the murder on me?
He doesn't know you, then?
He's lying, sir.
lf he doesn't know me,
what was l doing at his house?
What was he doing at your house?
l have lots of visitors. The house
Was full of people last night.
He must have come with someone.
lt sure is a small world, huh, Muzo.
Who did you come over with?
Why didn't you leave with them?
Why are you hiding out in my house?
Are you some sort of terrorist,
who are you, man?
Muzo, man, don't be a jerk.
Why don't you re co cognize me?
l don't know this guy.
You're driving me crazy, dammit!
Sir, if you like, l can refresh
their memories with electricity.
No, junior, no torture.
Are you aware of your crime?
What crime? We did nothing wrong.
You stand accused of three crimes.
No way!
They can't be looking for me too!
Sir, these two friends need at least
a little shock to jog their memories.
No, no torture.
No torture. . .
l swear l would go straight to the
European Human Rights Council. . .
l have lawyer friends in Strasburg. . .
l'd have a case in no time.
Do you know who l am?
Yes You're Muzo.
Okay, so treat me accordingly.
Sir, talking with this Muzaffer
is no good.
Let's use the new Chinese machine.
No! No torture!
Look, l have written confessions.
Just sign them and get it over with.
lt's late, l want to go to bed. We too
have families waiting at home, right?
What crime, l haven't done anything.
My only crime was going to Muzo's.
You fled the military. lf this goes to
a military tribunal, you've had it.
l'm no deserter. l was reassigned.
l was on my way to my new post.
Cut the crap and sign.
l'm not signing anything.
l won't sign if he won't sign.
What are we signing, anyway?
No one's going anywhere
until you sign.
What are those?
Your written confessions.
And what crimes would those be?
Auto theft, robbing a market. . .
. . .throwing a Molotov cocktail
into a coffee house.
Sir, you must have mixed me up with
another lbrahim.
l've been in the army for four months
now. This stuff is not my thing.
The only crusade l have
is against my brother in law.
This guy might be lying,
but it still has nothing to do with me.
Why should l be lying?
Look, if you did nothing, and this is
a mistake, we'll sort it out in court.
lf you're innocent, you'll be freed.
lf you can give us an alibi. . .
. . .you'll be released. This is the way
it is, there's no other way out.
l have nothing to do with this
why should l sign and go to court?
Let me go l have to join my corps.
l need to get the midnight bus. . .
. . .for role call in the morning.
Either sign these willingly, or junior
here will beat you until you do.
l don't care for torture, so l'm
offering you this for your own good.
lf we sign, can we go?
Where?
Where do you think? To my corps.
No, that's after the trial.
And blow my military service?
You already blew it.
No way!
Come on, sign!
l won't! What's the use, if l've
already blown my service?
Could we make a little call to
General Headquarters?
No. You can't even piss
until you sign.
Will the courts free us immediately?
Sure, if you're innocent.
Why shouldn't l be? l have
nothing to do with this stuff. . .
so l'll sign and be freed.
You can do what you like with Muzo.
Don't sign, you idiot!
You're an idiot. . .
. . .you're screwed if you don't sign.
Okay now Muzo, you sign.
And if l don't?
Sign now, or we'll torture
you until dawn. lf you like. . .
. . .we'll start with a little beating.
When you give up, you'll sign.
l'm too sensitive to withstand
torture. l have an ingrown toenail. . .
. . . l almost pass out whenever
l have it trimmed.
So if we sign now,
can we refute it in court?
Of course! That's what trials are for.
This is just a formality for the files.
Good. . .
Now, tell me.
Who is the third man?
What third man?
This was the work of three people.
Tell us his name, the file will be
complete, and the trial can start.
What third man?
l signed so l wouldn't suffer.
So, what, now we have to
make up a third man?
Just tell us the name of a friend,
or the trial can't start.
l don't care! l already wish
l hadn't signed.
Why should l confess to something
l never did?
What, we're going to prison now?
Well of course.
You're not serious, inspector?
He's bullshitting.
The crime is there, the confessions
are there, you signed; you can't walk.
lf we release you, we'll be charged.
The police can be apprehended, too.
So tell me the name of the third
man and l'll return the favor. . .
. . . l'll send the file straight to
court, the trial can begin. . .
. . .and you won't be in for long.
l promise.
No way! l have some business
at the bank tomorrow morning!
And l have to be in Siirt
in the morning for role call.
l need to take the night bus.
So let's pick someone.
How about Aydýn?
Aydýn Diktepe.
Who's that?
That friend. The third man.
The big cheese.
Address?
l don't know exactly, but he has
a snack bar right in Taksim.
Hey Muzo, what was Aydýn's snack
bar called? Ay or Dýn?
Are you Aydýn Diktepe?
Yes.
l was just home, peacefully watching
TV. l was going to turn in early. . .
and see Jennifer Lopez in my dreams,
and look what you did to me.
Take your papers and join your corps?
Why are you in lstanbul?
And why didn't you just go to your
father's place, or your girlfriend's?
Why be a pain in my ass and cause
all this trouble?
Do we know each other?
Why did you lead the police
to my house?
l'm sorry, are you talking to me?
Don't get on my nerves, lbrahim.
Oh, so you know my name, sir!
l'm ruined. Look what happened
thanks to you, just when l was. . .
. . .starting to make it.
Would l have let you in. . .
. . .if l knew you were running
from the cops?
lt's all that asshole brother in law's
fault. lf he hadn't turned me in. . .
none of this would have happened.
No military service, no commander. . .
. . .no role calls. As soon as l get out of
here, l'm going to kill that guy.
Why did you pretend
not to know me?
You should have gone to your sister's
house and killed her husband. . .
so you could come here to serve
time for murder, nice and orderly.
Why did you have to get me
mixed up in all this?
What do you mean?
l came to lstanbul to see you.
Why come and visit me? What did
you want? What good did it do?
We're blood brothers,
aren't we, Muzo?
Blood brothers? That's grade school
stuff. What does blood brother mean?
You've changed a lot, Muzo.
Yes l have
You've become
a totally godless man.
Now you've nailed Aydýn.
Why did you spill his name?
He just came to mind. Should l
have named Cumhur instead?
Why'd you have to say anything?
The trial wouldn't start!
l don't care. lf you hadn't come to me
there'd be no trial in the first place.
You screwed me, lbrahim.
Why should l do that?
We have nothing to do with this. l'm
screwed, my military service blown.
How long have you run the
snack bar in Taksim?
Seven years. Everyone knows me
there. l have no enemies, brother.
Don't call me brother, call me sir.
Ok, brother. l mean, sir. l'm sorry, l
don't know what to do at these times.
l've never been arrested.
Everybody knows me in Taksim.
l've been there for seven years, never
had a fight. Ask Ahmet, the driver.
Don't say my name. Just ask who
is the most decent snack bar manager.
He'll say Aydýn. lf he doesn't,
l'll slit my wrists.
There was just a tax debt from
last year. lf that's why l'm here. . .
l'll pay it with interest this year.
We'll pay in three installments.
Who goes to your snack bar?
Everybody.
Everyone who passes through
Taksim can stop by.
Aren't there any regulars?
Yes, there are.
Right, then tell me who they are.
Drivers, Ahmet the dispatcher,
students, drag queens. . .
l mean the organization!
What organization?
Give me a cigarette.
l can't.
l don't have many left and we don't
know when we're getting out.
Don't be a bastard, Muzo. There
aren't going to be enough cigarettes.
We'll figure something out. So stop
pissing me off and toss me one.
Not on your life.
Listen Muzo, now l'm going to have
to kill you and smoke your cigarettes.
And with every one, l'd think on your
death. So quit the filtered bullshit. . .
. . .and toss me a smoke.
ls Asuman married?
l don't know.
Why should l care?
Asuman, we need to talk.
l have get home.
lt's late, brother lbrahim.
Don't call me brother, Asuman.
That slut must be married.
You came to lstanbul for that bitch?
No way.
What does she have to do with it?
She has everything to do with it.
We're in prison and all you can ask. .
. . .is whether Asuman is married? lf
you're so curious, ask your family.
l'm not talking to them.
You don't have to answer me
right away, Asuman.
l'm engaged.
Engaged? What? To who?
He's an officer.
We were neighbors when l was born.
He was born three months before me.
Our mothers agreed to it then.
Stupid whores! What's that all about?
Are you still a baby?
No. . . l don't know. . .
how should l know?
Forget this childhood crap! Why
should you marry the guy next door?
lt's perverted. You can't do it
l won't let you.
No one else can have you.
Anyway, l've already told everyone
around that you're mine. . .
so it's done.
But l can't break the engagement.
l'll break it into a thousand pieces!
God damn you, lbrahim.
l already am.
What else could he do?
What's my crime?
What's mine? Do l have one?
Of course. The police went after
you and like a fool you came to me.
The police are always looking
for a little ex citement.
And boom!
Here we are.
You, up there! You're surrounded!
Put your hands on your head.
lf you come down now,
no one gets hurt! Surrender!
Why were the cops after you?
No reason, just cop stupidity.
They chased me because l ran.
There was no reason to chase me.
Why did you run?
No reason! But then, it seemed that
the cop was going to say. . .
Hey you! C'mere! Come on. Why are
you in lstanbul on your way to Siirt?
Are you here to drink raký with
Muzo or what?
so it gave me a weird feeling.
We looked each other in the eye. . .
and l ran.
Of course, that fool chased me.
l'm a little past the usual age for
military service, so in Burdur. . .
l was always taken for a terrorist
when l was on leave on weekends.
Since then, whenever l see
the police or the gendarme. . .
l have this urge to run.
Stop! Wait!
Fuck your urges!
You should have done your service
when you were 20, like everyone else.
l thought l'd start a business and then
go, so l wouldn't have trouble.
What business? You've always been
nothing but a gambler!
How can you start a business
without capital?
l couldn't get my dad to sell the shop.
He loves that shit more than me.
How could l get my capital
without gambling?
You've gambled for years
what kind of capital did you raise?
Okay, it hasn't been so great lately,
but my luck is change.
Yeah. lt has.
We're in prison.
Let's not waste time let's get down
to it. Tell me everything you know!
l swear, sir, l don't know anything.
l have nothing to do with this stuff.
You don't say?
l swear to God, sir.
Everyone swears to God. They lie,
and they look straight in my eyes.
They swear and God does nothing.
Quite right, sir.
l'll just shit the day someone
comes right out and confesses.
Whoever we arrest is innocent.
lt's as if they're here by mistake.
As if we didn't know who to arrest.
As if. . .
Where are we going to piss?
We aren't.
What? How long can l hold it?
lt's got to come out eventually.
Hey! Officer! Sir! Hellooooo!
Anyone there?
What is it?
Who are you?
What's it to you?
What do you want?
l have to take a leak
Do it there, then.
Where, exactly?
Right where you are!
Just be careful that you don't piss in
the wind, or you'll get it in your face.
What is it? Why are you laughing?
l'm sorry. . . l'm feeling nervous.
Don't, or you'll make me nervous.
Look, here is the list of the crimes
that you committed with your friends.
They confessed and signed.
Why not sign too, and be done with it.
l know them, but l didn't do anything.
lbrahim is a soldier now.
There must be a mistake.
They are waiting for you downstairs.
lf you like, sign now and join them.
lf not, we'll torture you 'til dawn. . .
. . .and carry you there in a stretcher.
Do you think a lawyer
could help us?
That'd be great,
but how do we get one?
We have to make a call.
To who?
My aunt's daughter Melda is a lawyer.
l gave her power of attorney.
She doesn't have mine.
That doesn't matter.
l'll get out and you stay here.
l'm thinking of me, not you.
Helloooo, officer. . .
What is it?
Can we make a telephone call?
Who are you gonna call?
We want two call two girls.
They must be asleep by now,
right Hasan?
Sure.
You'd better just do each other!
Son of a bitch!
You're a fucking son of a bitch.
lf l go down there, l'm going to shit. . .
right into your mouth, you faggot.
Pimp. Motherfucker.
That night, the three of us got a cab.
l held a knife to the driver's neck
and told him to pull over.
We threw him out and l drove.
We went to a store. l went in with the
knife. The others followed me.
l held the cashier up by knifepoint
and he opened the register.
The others took the cash in
shopping bags. We got out fast.
As we passed a coffee house,
lbrahim threw a Molotov cocktail. . .
for the hell of it.
He does such things all the time.
That wasn't all on one night, son.
These are different things.
Really?
Of course.
The taxi job was January 13th. The
store was five days later, the 18th.
But that's impossible?
What's impossible?
l wasn't in lstanbul on the 18th.
No way!
Turn off the camera. Turn it off!
How many cigarettes do we have?
There is no ''we'' here.
Okay, alright, how many
cigarettes are there, then?
None. They're gone.
What now?
Let's quit. lt's unhealthy. Everyone in
the world has quit. Only Turks smoke.
You're lying.
You have cigarettes.
Yes l do.
But we have to ration them.
When do we get one?
Whenever l feel like a smoke,
l'll give you a drag or two.
My lighter is out of gas.
Ah, but l have a lighter, so whenever
you want to smoke, give one here. . .
l'll light it, and l'd be happy
to give you a drag or two.
You're a jerk, lbrahim.
lf you had a lighter, you'd do worse.
What about him being
in lzmir that day?
Can you prove you were in lzmir?
What do you mean?
Do you have an alibi?
No. . .
Did you sign anything that day?
No.
Alright then, forget about lzmir. Who
knew you weren't in town that day?
Right. No one.
Good. Let's go on.
Turn on the camera.
January 18. night time, knife in hand,
l entered the market. . .
with lbrahim and Muzzafer.
l held up the cashier. . .
told him to open the register.
He did.
Muzzafer and lbrahim
put the money in shopping bags.
Hey, hey, don't take so many bags.
One per customer!
said that fool.
With the knife. . .
l cut him twice on the forehead.
While we were leaving, lbrahim. . .
Added letters to the market name
so it read ''Scarred market''.
He's always doing stuff like
that for no reason.
We got into a cab, but at first
he didn't want to take us.
Then we intimidated him into it and
drove straight to the coffee house.
Three Molotovs fell from the sky: for
the maker, the thrower, the catcher.
Aydýn, that Molotov cocktail business
is different that was February 9.
Really?
Sure. . .You're confused.
l'll split up the events
when we do the editing, sir.
Quiet, officer. The camera tapes every
stupid thing you say. lt's a waste.
Aydýn, tell us clearly about the taxi
kidnapping, not with the robbery.
There was no market?
The market comes later.
That night, Muzzafer, lbrahim and
l got a cab. lbrahim was in the front.
Muzaffer and l were in the back. l was
behind the driver. l pulled out a gun.
You said it was a knife before.
Really?
Yes.
ln the story there was a knife.
We can't edit this later.
No, the knife was in the market.
ln the taxi, l had a gun.
ls that so?
Yes.
l put the gun to the driver's neck,
l told him to pull over, slowly. . .
keep the motor running, and get out.
He obeyed like a lamb.
He said like a sheep, before.
Quiet, officer!
Then you were behind the wheel and
you stole the car and fled, right?
lbrahim was at the wheel and l was in
the back with the gun in my hand.
You said you were behind the wheel.
That was when l had the knife in my
hand. That was a different night.
These are all different events.
Sir, you're mixing everything up.
Okay, then, get a signature on a blank
paper from Aydýn and fill in the rest.
Shall we play a game for a cigarette?
Are we going to gamble?
No, a simple game.
l'll ask you a question.
lf you can't answer,
you give me a cigarette.
You'll ask something weird. Why
would l risk a cigarette for that?
Give me your lighter.
Don't bother, l'll light it.
No, l won't smoke.
Let's not smoke.
No one smokes, man.
And l think Asuman
must have married that soldier.
Respected and distinguished Rifat,
you know how l feel about Asuman.
lbrahim, from the neighborhood,
whom you know, asks for her hand.
l don't approve of her marriage
to another at all. . .
both from the point of view of the
neighborhood and in a general sense.
lbrahim, Asuman is still a child.
l mean, she is too young.
She's not too young.
Do you mean to say that l'm too old?
No, but you're not young, either.
There aren't ten years between us.
Fuck you, brother Rýfat!
My foot is numb, Muzo.
Can you move it for me?
Can't you move it yourself?
Can't you stand on it?
lt hurts when l do.
Did they torture you?
There was an automatic computerized
beating machine. They increase. . .
. . .the rhythm once in a while, like a
drum solo. Didn't they do it to you?
No, the officer, tipped us. Sign now,
he said, and you can refute it in court.
We signed right away.
He said that to me, too, but
l thought it would be stupid to sign.
Of course it's stupid.
Was there any other torture
apart from the beating?
Of course, of course.
The beating was just the beginning.
What else did they do?
Plenty. They have lots of different
machines. Everything is automatic.
lt's all very clean, like a hospital.
They are always cleaning up.
There's no blood at all, so you never
feel nauseated. And they have. . .
all of these first aid gadgets. lf
anything happens they have drips. . .
and all. l passed out a few times
and they woke me up in no time.
They hurt you a lot, didn't they?
l'm sorry Aydýn. We had to give
a name, or the trial wouldn't start.
Your name came to mind.
Thanks.
There's no reason to exaggerate.
So what, we're all having
an unusual night together.
Who knows when the last time
was that we were together.
Yeah, it's been a while.
lt's a good thing we got arrested.
lf you want, we can celebrate
June 13 as the world arrest day.
Okay, now let's sing a song.
This situation is no matter for celebration.
We have nothing to do with,
these robberies and tall tales.
They're framing us. With a lawyer,
we'll be out of here in no time.
l don't think so.
l confessed to everything.
What do you mean,
everything?
Auto theft, robbery, how we carved
an X on the cashier's head. . .
how we threw Molotov cocktails in
the coffee house, how we planned it. . .
and how we did it all, in full detail.
l thought the trial would be like
in the movies, really long.
We'd defend ourselves, there'd be a
break, commercials, more questions.
The judge said a few words and
the trial ended before we knew it.
Then he said, write, girl, and no one
understood what was going on.
l thought we were being acquitted.
Remember how he asked
if we had anything to say?
We're innocent,
your honor!
That doesn't mean shit.
They all say that.
You should have said we were
tortured into signing those statements.
But we didn't. We decided that
signing was the best thing to do.
Everything would be settled
in court, so we signed.
l signed after torture, but it doesn't
matter. You can't cheat fate, see.
l believe in destiny, man.
Are you out of your mind?
What destiny?
When we were born, it was written
that we would go to jail together.
There's nothing anyone
can do about it.
And why is it that lbrahim's
foolishness should be our fate?
You're the fool.
You have such a big mouth,
why didn't you say anything in court?
l was just about to.
Now, your. . .
Okay, enough. Understood!
. . .said the judge. Remember?
l thought he was convinced.
Because he was looking at me in
a very fatherly way when he spoke.
His eyes were so kind.
l thought, that's it, we're acquitted.
This is what happens
when you can't interject.
And what about you? You stood
at attention and whatever the judge. . .
said you just replied, ''yes,'' ''no.''
You couldn't even make a sentence.
l don't have any experience in court,
man. That was the first time for me.
l thought it would be a larger hall.
l thought there would be a jury and
l'd make eye contact with the chicks.
Hey! Simit seller!
Give us ten!
Why do you want ten?
Aren't you going to eat any?
Why didn't that crappy lawyer
of yours say anything, anyway?
She did. She said what
she could, anyway.
The girl really explained
the situation well in legalese.
in regards to the issues
mentioned in the case files. . .
we reiterate our objections, which
are laid out in a petition in said file.
As it has been proven that my client,
Aydýn Diktepe, was in lzmir. . .
on January 18, the charge of
the prosecution is null and void.
As the crime has been disproven,
l hereby appeal for acquittal. . .
in accordance with such and such
laws, this and that clause.
That Melda's defense was first class.
But it wasn't worth shit.
Well it was great that the market
owner said it wasn't us.
Why did that pansy taxi driver
say that it was us?
He said we looked like the guys,
he didn't say it actually was us.
lt was dark and l couldn't see. These
guys look like them, but l can't say. . .
You'll ex cuse me, but two of them
were behind me, by the way.
So why were we arrested,
for God's sake?
The trial isn't over.
We'll be in their custody until it is.
When will the trial be over, then?
The next hearing is August 1 0.
So that means we're inside until then?
lt's not just be over just like that
on the August 1 0. lt'll be a while.
Why? What's our crime?
lt's worse not to have a crime!
What will become of
my military service?
You'll rejoin when you get out of
jail and pick up where you left off.
Will the four months l did count?
They should.
They will.
lt depends.
They won't.
No way!
Don't worry about a thing, Mr. Rifat.
We also have trouble with him.
He's a troublemaker.
He's mad!
Exactly.
He abducted
Asuman and drove off!
Don't, brother lbrahim.
Don't start with that brother stuff.
Kiss me, Asuman.
Pervert! He stabbed me, you know.
No, really?
Sure. l couldn't walk for months.
Why'd he stab you?
Because l said,
''dammit,'' he said.
He's a burden for
the whole neighborhood.
The sooner he joins the army,
the better for everyone.
He hasn't done his military service?
No, sir. l don't get involved, but his
family, how can l put it, is too lax.
They don't care about anything.
They don't understand accounting.
lf they sold their shop and put
the money in the bank , they'd be rich.
But they're not aware, of it, and then
of course there's the lbrahim factor.
You just can't sort out family affairs if
he doesn't serve in the army.
So, he's an evader?
Yes, sir.
He has to be turned in.
Don't worry about a thing. l'll do it
first thing tomorrow. For all of us.
Go stand over there.
This way. Like that.
Take off your clothes. Leave your
underwear on only. Let's go.
Strip!
What's going on in ward 7?
The situation is out of control, sir.
They block the doors with the bunks
so we can't go in for headcounts.
For all we know, they're escaping.
That won't do. What do they want?
No idea. They just keep shouting
slogans. Let me talk to them.
Come in!
Sorry to disturb you. The gendarme
just brought those three terrorists.
Which ward shall we put them in?
Which ones are they?
The group from last month.
Weren't they the militants?
Yes, sir. Totally militant.
We need to split them up.
We could ask the prosecutor.
No, no need. lf we asked him
everything, he would be the director.
Then why would l be the director of the
prison?
Can we drink the water
from these taps, you think?
Try it. lf nothing happens to you,
we'll drink it, too.
lt doesn't say ''no drink'' on it.
There's no water in them.
No way!
How will we get cigarettes?
l dunno. This my first time here.
lsn't there a canteen or anything here?
There must be. l deliver
stuff to a military jail canteen.
The military is different, man. There's
order there. Civilian jails are a mess.
Mr. Guard, could we get some cigarettes?
Cigarettes.
Where can we get some?
We'll pay what you like.
Are you left wing?
No, we're wingless.
We're here because of some mix up.
We're getting out soon.
Everyone's here by mistake. There are
no criminals you're all innocent.
l know the story.
What cigarettes do you want?
Two cartons of Marlboro Light and
matches. You pay too, if you want.
l have no money.
l'll smoke yours in pairs.
What do you mean no money?
How were you going to go to Siirt?
You were gonna do me a favor. There
wasn't time to go into it with you.
Anything else?
A carton of 2000, and matches.
What about water, guard?
There are taps there.
They don't work.
Buy me three bottles of water, too.
Dig under there a little.
There. Very nice.
Respect for humanity will overcome
torture! Respect for humanity will. . .
What are they saying?
More slogans.
Respect for humanity
will overcome torture!
Respect for humanity will
overcome torture!
Do you think there's torture here?
Judging by the slogan, yes.
They're political criminals.
They torture them to undermine. . .
. . .their organizations.
We're not like that, though.
We already sang for them, anyway.
Not we, you. You did.
Well you signed your
confessions like lambs.
l wasn't going to sign, but lbrahim
said let's sign and get it over with.
Did l force you to sign? We didn't
even know each other at the time.
You said we be fucked if we didn't.
You said they'd beat us
until morning and then we'd sign.
l signed out of panic.
God punish you, lbrahim.
Where the hell is that warden?
Why hasn't he brought our cigarettes?
He'll bring them he wants a tip.
And he'll get it if he does.
Generosity will make things easier.
Sure, this guy is our hands and feet.
Yes but it'll cost us.
Thank you.
l wanted Marlboro Lights.
This is what they had.
l can't smoke these. One carton?
That's all they had.
And my change?
No change to be had here.
Come on, man.
Yeah, really. What kind of place
is this? Call reception and complain!
When did the judge say the trial was?
August 1 0.
And there are 1 5 days 'til August!
25 days here will drive me nuts.
Have a good trial.
We will.
lt is the court's decision that
incarceration be extended.
What's happening?
The 7 th ward is holding Ahmet.
He deserves it. He does everything
for cheap and ruins it for everyone.
Did you get a head count in Ward 7?
No, sir. We can't get in.
They've injured two wardens.
They're holding a warden.
They're like an army.
They hurl shards of glass
when we get too close.
l wonder how they throw that glass,
because it cuts like knives.
What about sleeping gas
in the vents?
We did, sir. They plastered the vents.
lt backfired, and the wardens fainted.
God. . .
Where'd they get the plaster?
They can find anything, sir.
This is no good.
No headcounts, possible escapes. . .
What am l directing here for then?
How could my prisoners do this
to me? l am their father and director.
Of course, sir, but it would be better
if we called in the army.
Only soldiers with bayonets
can go in and face these guys, not us.
Come in, soldier!
My respects, sir.
Good, you're here. Get two big pots.
l don't want one.
The largest size l'm going to plant
that loquat. l don't want a small one.
That loquat has a very complex root
system. lt tears walls, like fig trees.
As you wish, sir.
Osman. . .why did you come?
Uh, l was going to say. . .
Yes?
This lbrahim and his friends weren't
released so they want to be together.
Who are they?
Those guys who came last year:
they were supposed to be terrorists.
Their trials are still ongoing.
They've been in prison for two years.
They go to court, they say goodbye,
believing they'll be released. . .
Have a good trial.
We will. l'll be free by evening.
And in the evening they come back.
They're harmless guys, sir.
We can put them in a ward together.
Yes, but which one?
The wards are so dangerous.
lbrahim says it makes no difference,
it could even be the women's ward.
Sir, the children's ward is available.
We could put them there for now.
Okay, let's do that. But first, bring me
my two large pots. The biggest size.
lbrahim's trial was postponed again.
No! They've been in for two years.
He's there for a reason. Maybe
he robbed markets to settle bets.
The market owner said
it wasn't them.
He was probably scared.
My brother is innocent.
Should we get a different lawyer?
There's absolutely no need.
lt won't help, and the lawyer will want
money. lf he's innocent he'll be freed.
Plus, it's a relief not to have him here.
You don't say?
Still not free, lbrahim?
Nope.
Why doesn't this trial end?
The judge has a grudge, man.
Now they've connected us
to some other organization.
We're not an organization why should
we be related to another one?
Go tell the judge.
Three people makes an organization?
Let's just admit that we're organized.
As innocent men, we're treated badly.
l'm even starting to believe we did
that stuff. l cut that guy's head and. . .
They have to release me. The lawyer
has proof from the hotel in lzmir.
lt's been proved that l spent the night
there that night. Why am l still here?
l've had it. l want to escape.
That's the ticket.
There's a hunger strike in Ward 7.
l know.
Shall we join?
l can't. l don't even fast in Ramadan.
Why should we join the hunger strike?
What good would it do?
They die of hunger and they're
forgotten in three days. That's it.
Þuayips live on!
Þuayips live on!
See, now Þuayip is dead.
We need to join Ward 7 if we're going
to escape. They're digging a tunnel.
One night they'll be free as birds.
How do you know?
l feel it.
Where are they digging a tunnel to?
How far can they dig? Even if they've
finished the tunnel, l wouldn't go in.
Yeah, because you're stupid.
You're stupid.
lf we escape that makes us guilty.
We're still innocent. They'll see.
They won't see shit. We've been here
for over two years and still no release.
But there's no court order.
Yeah, but here we are, like fools.
Today is judgment day.
We'll see what fate has in store.
What fate? lt's acquittal for sure.
How do you know?
l have a feeling.
The court has elected the sentence
of 24 years imprisonment.
How are you? ls your health okay?
l'm fine, l'm very good, father.
How could the court do this?
We got 24 years instead of acquittal.
How could this happen, lbrahim?
l don't know, but l'm innocent.
ls it because of your friends?
No they're more innocent than me.
ln fact, they're here because of me.
What did you do, son?
Nothing, father.
Are you mixed up in terrorism?
No, there's no proof, nothing.
One guy said it wasn't us, the other
said maybe, the judge said 24 years.
Why'd the taxi driver say maybe?
He couldn't see so he said maybe.
But it's gone to the supreme court.
The lawyer has appealed.
Are you staying in a ward?
Uh huh.
ls it crowded?
No, no. . .
lt's embarrassing to say, but we
three are in the children's ward.
Do you need anything, son?
No, father, thank you.
ls Asuman married?
l don't know. l heard a rumor. . .
She married that guy, didn't she?
l guess so. Do you have money?
Yeah, l do. Thanks.
How'd you get it?
ls someone giving it to you?
No. l don't have money,
but l don't need it in here.
You must need it.This is
where you need money the most.
l'll leave some for you.
There's no need, father.
You need money more than l do.
We have money. . .
. . .we sold the store.
What? Why? Have you gone mad?
Your brother in law found
a good buyer. He paid good money.
He's taken you for a ride.
Two different checks, please.
One for 25, the other for 1 0 billion.
Why?
The 1 0 is my commission. . .
from my father in law. He promised
that if l sold the shop l'd get a cut.
Good luck to you.
He found the best interest rate for us.
Whose name is the account in?
l can't deal with banks. l left it all
to your sister and brother in law.
So you put the money in his account?
l convinced the fool for 25 billion.
Nice job, son.
l'll put it in the bank right away.
Good.
He and your sister opened an account
That's worse.
Why should it be worse, son?
We finally have some money.
l told you to sell when the time was
right, but you never listened to me.
l wasn't against it. l told you we'd
do it after your military service.
The first things l'm going to do when
l get out is shoot my brother in law.
My sister will be a widow,
but what can you do?
These wards are uncontrollable.
We need to use the American system.
You know, where every prisoner
is in a room of his own.
Like cells, right, chief?
Yes, but bigger and better.
They rile each other when they're
together and whoops! Hunger strike.
l saw Mehmet Ali Aðca's cell in ltaly.
lt was like a hotel room.
lt was bigger than our house.
lt had a TV and everything.
There was all this stuff there, but. . .
Hello, gentlemen.
Hello to you, sir.
Welcome, sir.
This storm came right on schedule.
Every year on March 23 it comes.
What news?
Bad news, sir.
What is it?
Four prisoners escaped from Ward 5.
No! Did you find out this morning?
No, in the papers.
Were they here for
the evening roll call?
We don't know, sir. lt's been a while
since we could do a roll call there.
This won't do. lf can't do roll call,
they will escape. How did they do it?
We don't know.
Didn't the newspapers say?
They said they walked away.
lmpossible!
These papers are full of lies. Wouldn't
we notice them walking away?
They're organized; they found a way.
What way? How did they find it?
Sir, l'm not speaking from experience,
but some guards take money. . .
. . .and they bring army or police
uniforms, that type of thing.
Of course, you know that l'm not, but
there are corrupt assistant directors.
Who? Which ones? There are so many
here. Why do we have so many?
l know, it doesn't make sense.
We have too many assistant directors.
Shall we play poker?
No.
Shall we buy a TV for our ward?
Why?
To take it apart and look inside.
Why do you think? To watch matches,
news. We just sit here like lumps.
Why should we settle here as if it were
our home? We'll be out of here soon.
We always say that, but today is the
6th annual World Arrest Day.
Are we celebrating it?
Wow, so it's been six years?
We got 24, so l guess there are
18 more. l feel old. Let's get that TV.
With what money?
l don't know l'm out.
My brother used to send me some,
but he's out of work now.
lbrahim is always poor.
What's that supposed to mean?
When my father left me money
three years ago, we spent it together.
l never said it was mine alone. Now
l have none and you're being mean.
No one has any money left, lbrahim.
We're not hiding anything from you.
Muzo has his dollars.
We can't change those.
Why?
The rate goes up every day.
Are you going to stick them together
and make a shroud for yourself?
That money is ours, but now is not the
time. We'll need it when we get out.
We've got to get out somehow.
We've written so many petitions and
no answer. Even the lawyer gives up.
What kind of fate is this?
Not everything is up to fate, man.
l told you we should try to escape,
but you never listen to me.
We were handcuffed together and you
were cuffed to a soldier.
Where were we supposed to go?
To the soldier's hometown?
You can pass it three times!
Don't waste your passes!
Smash it!
Oh, you guys don't know
how to play.
lf you like, we can plant a vine outside
the prison. lt's very aggressive.
lt's called the American vine, and
it would cover the prison in no time.
lt's not beautiful, though.
l want to plant a grape vine.
We can make a trellis for it.
That would be nice, sir.
You say that about all of my ideas.
Don't you have your own opinions?
l just don't want to disagree with you,
sir, but l don't think it will work out.
To plant grapes, add a trellis, a pool
are we an officer's club or a prison?
Good say what you think, even if it's
stupid. Then we can understand you.
No, sir. You wanted me to disagree,
so l did.
What could be wrong with vines?
And then a trellis is a good idea.
What about the woman idea?
The warden says no dice.
l told him we'd pay anything.
There used to be a way to their ward,
but they built a wall and ruined it.
There are nice women there,
but we can't have them here.
What do you mean we can't?
Everything is possible here.
l read about this guy in the paper.
He was on the most wanted list.
He came to Turkey, met his girlfriend
in prison, and escaped. lmpossible. . .
That's different, lf he's on the most
wanted list, he works for the state.
But the warden said he could
get a blow up doll.
A blow up doll?
Yeah, it's just like a woman.
We can take turns. Then we deflate it
and hide it. And we can do it again.
That's the best way it won't get
pregnant or sick, no fear of STDs. . .
ls it plastic?
lt's this latex stuff, whatever that is.
lt's just like a woman.
Have you seen one?
l've done one, man.
Where?
ln my civilian days. ln Ankara.
A friend brought one from Germany
and he let me do it once.
Just once?
Yeah, he was a jealous guy.
Was it good?
Wonderful. Just like a woman.
How much is it?
l don't know we have to ask.
Did he say he could get one?
Yes.
Let's do it, then.
With what money?
Well for this we could
change some dollars.
Good idea.
Definitely.
Because it's not quite settled when
we are going to escape from here.
Are we escaping?
Definitely.
What's the plan?
There isn't one.
Good.
We need to come up with
a good one.
We'll say we're all sick and ask
to be transferred to the hospital.
All of us sick at the same time?
Why not?
What'll be our illness?
l don't know, let's think of one.
We can be poisoned. We'll say
our stomachs need to be pumped.
Will we really be poisoned?
We'll just put a little in our food.
Who will decide how much to put in?
Too much and we'll be in trouble.
How do you come up with this stuff?
How are we going to find poison?
Suppose that we did, and we got to
the hospital. How would we escape?
Don't you know that it's easier to
escape a hospital than a prison?
You don't. So listen. ln the hospital
l'll trick a nurse and start a thick. . .
and creamy love. l'll ask for her hand,
right from the start.
Hello, how are you?
Will you marry me?
Yes! Yes!
One, two, three.
The nurse will lose control, having
waited years for a proposal like this.
Taking her husband and his friend
under her wing, she sneaks them out.
And who awaits them at the hospital
exit, behind the ambulance wheel?
Brother Ambul!
Hey, what's up, Ambul my man?
What you'd expect, lbrahim.
Just ambulancing. Raki's in the back.
Great, man.
We get into the ambulance, and zoom.
Stuttgart. What do you think?
And what if the nurse
turns you down?
l'll find another. One of them'll bite.
Don't spoil my plan. lt's all arranged.
Don't look at me like that. Now
we're in Stuttgard in die stat zentrum!
Alright, lbrahim. Cut it out.
Cut what out, man?
We have to get out. my brother in law
holds the family purse strings.
And Asuman is married.
Unfortunately, father, in this situation,
we can't accrue any interest.
How could that huge
bank go bust?
Actually, they don't; they transfer the money
somewhere and say it's gone.
We've lost a lot of money. lf only we
hadn't sold the store. The price is up. . .
And we can't buy another store
with what we have.
What do we have?
Our capital.
Surely they'll give that back to us.
l highly doubt it.
You mean our capital is gone?
Sadly, yes. The bank went bust.
What are you saying?
They have to return our capital!
There's no one left to ask. The owners
fled overseas and the state took over.
We have a right to appeal, but
we don't know what will come of it.
So our money is under the state
custody. They can pay us right away.
No one has seen the state
pay in a hurry.
The state pays in minute installments,
over years. Forget that money.
Why did l listen to you and sell
the store? Fuck your bright ideas!
That hurts, father.
Good! Two more grape vines are
coming. Take extra good care of them.
Plant them side by side, intertwining.
Yes, sir.
Sir!
Hello. The grape vines arrive today.
That's wonderful, sir.
The public prosecutor called
with an urgent situation.
He thinks everything is urgent. Water
the vines as soon as they arrive, OK?
Yes, sir.
You understand me?
Perfectly well, sir.
lt's autumn but those stupid crickets
are still at it.
They sure are, sir.
A U FO was spotted in the skies over
Vinix. lt fell, not flew. Jerking. . .
lbrahim, when is our
blow up doll coming?
She's here already.
Today she'll join our ward.
No way! Great!
What's taking the warden so long?
He'll bring it as soon as he can.
lt's a huge package, you know.
What shall we name it?
Asuman, the slut.
No one chase her,
she's mine first.
And why is that?
Because l paid for her.
l don't care. l can go last. Go ahead.
l care, buddy.
What difference does it make? lt's not
a virgin l'll go first, you later.
Nothing doing. lf you go first,
it won't be any good anymore.
When you go to a brothel,
do you ask for a virgin, lbrahim?
lt's not the same thing at all.
This doll is unused.
They must have used it in the factory
quality control.
Like in car factories they do a test
drive. A foreman must've ridden her.
Be that as it may, what rule
says that Muzo has to go first?
There's no reason for you to, either.
Let's toss a coin, pull straws,
spin the bottle. We'll do what it takes.
No, l'm going first.
l'll pop her before l let you.
Okay, l see. l'll do it right away, sir.
My respects, and have a good day, sir.
What did he say?
Hello lbrahim.
lt's Muzaffer.
Of course. . .
Hello lbrahim.
l'm Aydýn.
Yes, well. . . Hello lbrahim.
ls lbrahim being punished?
No, no! Friends, l have good news
for you. You're free! Pack you bags!
Where are we going?
Anywhere. You're innocent.
lt's a trick. They'll shoot us
and say we were trying to escape.
We're happy this way, sir.
We were just settling in.
No, my friends. Your innocence
is proven. The release papers are here.
How did they find out
we're innocent?
The three real culprits were
caught robbing a jeweler.
They confessed to all their crimes.
Osman, help them move out.
Come to my room for a cup of coffee
before you go. Congratulations!
God bless, friends!
Are we really free, Osman?
Of course! The director is
expecting you. Be quick.
You won't need to take the TV,
the mattresses and things.
You were here for nothing, and
here l took you all for real men.
So we're not real men, then.
What about our blow up doll?
Let it be your present to me. l'll blow
it up and make some money out of it.
Really? You'll be a blow up pimp,
then, Osman!
They can say what they like as long as
they pay. l'm a materialist.
So long, bro.
Good bye, bro.
Okay, then.
Don't pull something like this again.
But we didn't do anything!
Oh yes, of course. lt's just a habit
of mine after all these years.
We were not only innocent, but we
were imprisoned for over 6 years.
These things happen.
This is a long mistake.
The state owes us that time.
Can we get compensation for time
served for nothing, sir?
l don't think so.
Then what's in it for me?
Justice is not so fair after all.
Unfortunately.
l'm sorry. Soldier!
What's going on?
Where are you from, bro?
Samsun.
No way, downtown?
Yes.
Me too. What neighborhood?
1 9 Mayýs.
No way! Which street?
Talimhane.
l can't believe it. What's your name?
Osman.
l remember you! l could see it from
your eyes. They never change.
We were neighbors.
lsn't your mother's name Melahat?
Süheyla
Yeah, Süheyla. l remember her well.
How come l don't remember you?
You're much younger than me,
Osman. l remember you as a baby.
No way!
Yes. My mother loved you.
When you were a baby, aunt Sema.
Süheyla. . .
. . .yes. Süheyla had no milk,
so my mother breastfed you.
No way!
We're milk brothers! Embrace me!
Before going to the headquarters,
let's drop by my house for a minute.
My mother would love to see you.
l can kiss her hand and get her
blessing. l haven't seen her for years.
lbrahim!
Yup.
Freeze! Don't move!
Brother!
lbrahim, what have you done?
The state owed me six years and
three months. Now we're even. Sorry.
What's going on?
Shhh.
Did you kill him?
Yes, but we all planned the murder.
What murder?
l shot my brother in law.
The state owed me 6 years
and three months.
For three of us, that's
18 years and 9 months.
The murder sentence will be divided
by three, and they'll still owe us.
