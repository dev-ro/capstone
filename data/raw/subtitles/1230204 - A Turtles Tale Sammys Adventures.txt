Move out out the way
you crazy turtle
Look out.
Humans!
Seems to me like
they're always in a hurry.
But they have nowhere to go?
That was my old buddy, Ray.
He almost got himself run over.
We were born on this very same beach
some 50 years ago
And we've been buddies ever since.
Today is a special day.
We both going to be granddads.
Imagine that!.
It could be some time before
the little ones are born.
So let me tell you about our first
meeting with the people.
Once this was almost
deserted beach.
Nothing, except turtles.
And the sound of those
beautiful waves.
Come on. Be even faster.
I can not get out.
- Go on.
To the water.
We're wasting time.
Until thirty years.
- Or not.
Hello? Anybody out there?
I was barely five minutes old and I had the
feeling that I was not going to make it.
Help. Let me go.
Hi, there.
Watch out.
That was pretty cool, huh?
It was like we were flying.
You don't look too good.
Can you move?
We must go now.
There are good waves.
We must go, Shelly.
There are birds everywhere.
Wait, we must help him.
Come on, Shelly.
There is nothing you can do for him.
Shelly?
Come on, do not give up.
You can still make it. Try.
Get up. Try.
Let me go.
Shelly?
And so it began for me.
A little nudge to start me off.
Anyway, I was on my way.
SAMY'S EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY
Hi, there. New to the  currents?
Since yesterday.
- Awful young to be all alone out here.
This may be very scary.
- Scary?
It's a big pond, if you
have not noticed.
Many creatures will want to get you.
- You'll find out soon enough.
Find out what?
- Where do I start?
How about barracuda.
- Barra... What?
Cudas. Fastest predator in the ocean.
- Then you got your big white.
White
- Very fast fish.
And big teeth too.
- Do not mind them.
Go with your instincts and you'll be fine.
No reason to be scared.
I'm not scared.
- You should be.
You're not even a snack
for most creatures out here.
Just follow your instincts.
Good luck on your journey.
What am I suppose to be looking for?
- If you find out, let us know.
Beware of the nets, otherwise
you're turtle soup.
And don't eat the plastic.
Seaweed good, plastic bad.
 
What did you do that for?
Do I look like food to you?
Crazy fish.
What a way to start the journey.
How is it going, guys?
Looking mighty cosy out here.
Shove off you big oaf.
What ever get in your shell?
- We need all our food.
Get out of here.
- Yeah, go.
I would not ride on your stupid whatever,
if you were the last turtles in ocean.
Good.
- Go away.
Hi, guys.
- Hey Hey Hey. Don't even think about it.
Oh right, I am not one of your kind.
- You got that right.
Watch out.
Man, this is not my day.
- Why did you whack me on my head?
But I ...
- Luckily I didn't pass out.
Look at that.
 Got a bump the size of a barnacle.
Probably get bigger take over my whole head.
I do not think it will ...
- Never seen them barnacles?
 You let'em hitch a ride with you, they never leave.
 A Bunch of freeloaders.
Hello.
Goodbye.
What is that thing you're on anyway?
Did you make it?
I fell on it.
Long story. How's your bump?
No worries. Us Leathers got heads like rocks.
The name is Ray.
- Sammy. Pleased to meet you.
How long have you been on the journey
- Just one day.
Me too. Cought the jib up north.
- So did I.
Say, we have a lot in common you and me.
Do you want to hop on
- Nah, I'm fine.
It was a joke.
See how we suppose to be floating around until we grow up and all.
This small raft of yours
could come in handy
this ain't bad.
Are you sure about this?
I do not want go frendly like
and then they go wack you on one day or wanna kick me off.
I would not do that.
Besides we were hatched on the the same day...
Practicaly on the same beach.
So we are practicaly brothers.
Brothers? I like that.
The sun feels good, don't it?
I like laying out in the sun,
good for my skin.
Because you know when a turtle gets all dried up
and everything, gets all flaky i don't like that.
And that's how I met Ray.
He was certainly a character.
Always fun and never at a loss for words.
For ten years or so my life in the open sea
consisted of mainly floating and waiting.
You should try some. It is good.
Got to be kidding?
My jellyfish are a little more refine?
That's what you call refine?
Oh I love'em.
They do give me gas though.
Despite all the stories
I heard ...
the ocean didn't seem like a scary place after all.
It was quite a good life here.
Time seemed to fly.
Before we realized, we were ...
grew up.
Almost grown up then.
This is life, buddy.
- No gasproblemen today, Ray?
It's okay.
Did you know that two knapperds
leave when we were there?
No, not seen.
- They looked at you.
Not true.
- Yes it is.
Do you think we stay mates
- Forever and ever.
Not?
- Absolutely.
But at a certain point
and I'm not now ...
but sometime in the future,
we must find a girl, right?
Yes, of course ...
- Have you ever thought about?
Maybe.
What is your type?
- No idea.
Everyone still has a type?
For me, a smile and they love
jellyfish are, of course.
Of course.
What is your type now
- I've already met her.
Is that so? Come on, this is great news.
Tell me.
You're going back to exaggerate.
- You've already done yourself.
Her name is Shelly.
She was nice.
Where did you meet her
- she was important
in my early years.
What?
We met the day after birth.
We have been together ever since
and yet it is an important part?
Yes, she was.
I want all the juicy details.
- There are none.
Talking or I keep teasing you.
- All right.
Come on, I listen.
Impressive story.
You saved her life.
It was more an accident.
The bird crashed.
You spit sand in his face.
You saved her life.
No idea if she is saved.
- You never know.
It is a small ocean.
Perhaps we ever against her.
Maybe.
Is not this great
- very great.
Ray was the best friend
I could have.
He was great, always good humored
and always looking for adventure.
One thing though ...
I could have done without his stinky jellyfish
Get up!
Come on, Sammy. Get up!
About time, sleepyhead.
What have you been doing?
- Exploring.
Made friends with an octopus.
You should really take a look.
All ate?
I'll get something on the way.
- Picky, picky, picky.
Where are you taking me?
- I see you. We're almost there.
Hi, buddy.
- Hello.
Grab your determination.
Come on, do not be afraid
- of course not.
Alright then.
It will be fantastic.
Come on.
Hold on to what's yours.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.
We're goin' ta crank it up now!
So was that fun or what!?
Hey, what did you do that for?
- There is no room here.
Especially for your stinking jellyfish.
- What are you talking about?
We can not move.
- Maybe I need my jellyfish ...
itself and the flow going.
Then you have the space
for yourself.
I did not say.
Well, pressure is no longer.
Is not it?
- Ray ...
Why the hurry, guys?
Ray, it just has me.
Hold on, I take you out.
Do not panic, I break through it.
- It's too hard.
I can not bite through.
Ray!
Wait for me here.
I will find a way out.
I'll wait here for you, Sammy.
Help!
Sammy!
Do not.
That was the first time I
saw real fear on Ray's face.
I was also scared.
This was a time when I wanted
to have some luck.
One of those little nudges.
I felt I'd never see him again.
It got to be 80 degrees out here.
Try 90.
What's ya got over there?
- It's a little greenback.
Maybe we could make soup?
That little guy's overcooked already.
Chuck him.
Look what a cute little turtle.
You see the turtle, Fluffy
- he looks so scared.
We'll get him some food and we'll take
real good care of him.
Fluffy, eat turtle food.
It is dinner time for you.
Okay, let's set things
right, turtle.
These are my people.
- I was not here.
You people brought me here.
- Note: Apply it as
soon as possible.
Unless you want to end up like
my ex-friend chicken.
Chicken
- Absolutely.
Who else was loft
- they eat animals?
But she seemed so nice?
Let the good behavior
you do not cheat.
They stop you full as a goose,
then the pate for everyone.
Here she comes.
- Here, kid.
You're so skinny.
We need to fatten you up.
Come on, do not be afraid.
Do not forget.
You have been warned. Bon appetite.
You have a strange way Ralph of proving
that the world has grown smaller.
So, have you given any more thought
to your escape?
Every day you look fatter.
The day will surely come.
You and your chicken stories.
Can you really travel the world?
Of course.
I myself have traveled everywhere
with my Humans.
Since they rescued me from the Seine,
in Paris, back in May '68.
It has been magnifique.
So there are other oceans?
On one day Snow found
a female turtle.
I think they wish we ...
- Pairs?
Believes that they are not
- they would probably
more turtles.
I understand what couples.
This is really not
going to happen.
And who is your furry friend?
- Fluffy. These are his Humans.
Exactly.
Stay away from my Humans.
From me you shall love Humans.
Crazy creatures.
The further I'm away from
them, the better.
Tell me, how long have you been a prisoner
- I'm not a prisoner.
Yes? Why are you still here?
- The questions I have weeks.
Go away, whisker.
I take it together.
Where I come from, it
looks like a prison.
But believe what you want
if you feel better.
Fluffy.
- Time to eat. Bye.
I'm Sam.
- Vera.
Talk about food: I starve.
Hairball Feeding them
only, or us?
At sunset.
- Beautiful.
Do nothing unexpected.
Make us awake when
it's time to eat.
You see, you're our little
peace ambassador.
Merry Christmas, kid.
As she painted on my shell?
- Turn around.
Are you stupid? The sign.
What did I tell you?
You're marked, my friend.
There you go again with the chicken and your funny words.
Do not take on, Sammy.
You look so cute.
- Why do they dress up as?
Do you understand that? It's Christmas.
Gifts.
Maybe this is sign my gift.
Doubtful.
Get your no thoughts
in your hard shell.
She is only nice because
it's Christmas.
I did not know whether Fluffy's chicken
story was true or not.
I wanted to believe Snow was a kind human
and that he would not do me ...
but you never know with Humans.
It was not long before the
hippies realized ...
that Vera and I would not mate.
They said: We have several
auras or something.
That must be you.
- You were still like Vera?
Vera is too old and
tough for me.
But you are just about right.
- Vera.
None of you belong here.
I want you off the beach.
Snow, she take Fluffy along.
The army will surely
send to Vietnam.
You there, get out.
Quick, go.
- What?
You're coming with us.
That is, it's chicken time.
You hide, now.
They did the same with ...
You understand me.
Wait and do not move.
You do not end up as stew.
Come on, get out.
Wait, where is the little one?
I find him anywhere.
Silence.
- Everyone away.
Live a good life, turtle.
The time I was with Humans,
wanted rid of me Fluffy.
But eventually they went away.
I never quite understood
what happened.
At that point I thought I should
not go on this journey.
Maybe I was too long the Humans.
But there was no turning back.
Follow me.
What did I tell ya?
- This is what I needed.
No.
- Wait.
What's that noise
- I heard nothing.
Yes, this is tasty.
Shark. Help!
Are you hurt?
- He bit me quite hard.
He's coming back.
Quickly, this way.
Hurry. He's gaining on us.
Keep going.
Over there.
That was close.
- Too close.
Hey you, great!
That's right, I thee into sight.
You have the wrong turtle angry.
Want some of this?
Is that all you got?
I'll call you big wimp, not
the great white shark.
Vera!
Do you think that hurts?
Nice. Is that all you got?
I take fish from you.
I have a hard shell,
Fish Breath.
You heard me and let
me follow you swim.
That felt good.
No more worries about Mr. Shark.
You were incredible.
Are you two related?
No, we're just friends. Sort of ..
- Go to go, feed the boy.
A fat turtle,
is a happy turtle.
Take care of yourself, either.
- Do you feel okay?
Do not give up.
You can still catch. Try.
Hey, wait a minute.
You're Shelly.
How do you know my name?
- Is this a dream?
No, I do not.
Are you the one from the beak of
a bird fell, when you were born?
Wait.
I knew I recognized you.
You have saved my life twice.
What? No, the first time was by accident.
- No, it was fate.
I do not even know your name.
- Sammy.
Well Sammy, that's incredible.
- Yes, indeed.
How is your shield
- the only one scratch.
Have you as much as I hunger
- Hungrier.
Life is strange, just when you thought
everything was quite difficult ...
kinds of things happen suddenly,
and, life is beautiful.
Shell, you never get bored?
Floating, swimming in circles.
That's what we do.
- Yeah, but ...
would not it be great to
travel around the world?
Why? This is our world.
- I think there is much
more than these waters.
Such as?
Humans talk about ice
oceans and strange islands.
I want to see them.
- You are definitely a different
kind of turtle.
Why I think you probably like it.
- Do you like me?
What's not to like?
How do you plan to see the world?
Have you ever heard of a secret passage?
- Do you think there is one?
Yes.
- Weather of the Humans heard?
Maybe they all made up.
- Maybe, but I want to
do something unique.
I want see the world, ice oceans.
Will you go crazy with
a turtle like me?
Is this a proposal, Sammy?
- Yeah, I guess so.
I really want to go with you.
- Really?
Not every day you get the chance
to see the world, right?
How do we find the secret passage
- that I'm not sure.
Let southward. We ask around.
Everything suddenly
fell into place.
I had a purpose, a journey,
and best of all ...
someone to share it with.
Taste the water.
- It is sweet.
I remember that Humans said something about
swimming through the secret passage.
You think we're close?
- Yes, this must be it.
Let's check it out.
It is beautiful here and different.
- That's for sure.
Did you know?
- There are birds everywhere.
We must be careful.
Look.
I have never seen such a large
snake in the ocean.
Maybe he is the guardian
of the secret passage.
He comes awfully close.
- Come on, let's go further.
That is a very strange beast.
- It seems more like a monster.
Did you know?
- What?
I'm not sure.
It feels like we followed.
Sammy?
I do not think we need to worry,
they are not so great.
That is true, except that they
are very scary teeth.
And, they prove to be too much.
You see, I told you ...
Let me go.
Why have you brought me here?
Stop it.
Stop.
Fine. How do I go down?
Sammy.
I was so scared.
I thought I had lost
you forever.
Diving.
Perhaps the search for the
secret passage a bad idea.
I might know where it is.
When I was in that tree was ...
I saw a place for all large ships
sailing in the distance.
I think we're close, very close.
We made it. You were right.
- There through, is difficult.
Sammy, you come too close.
Follow me, we need to ship.
Maybe we should go back.
- They have already closed
the door behind us.
We have come this
far, we get it.
Sammy.
- Shelly.
I can not hold the rope.
- I'm here to help.
Hurry.
Sammy.
- Shelly. No.
Shelly. Where are you?
Shelly.
Shelly.
Hey there, turtle.
What is that crazy doohickey on your shell?
It is a sign of Humans.
It is a peace sign.
A peace sign?
Where have I heard that before?
I think ...
and think. That's what she called it.
Who
- just as someone young
and brave as you.
She talked a lot.
She kept talking about sweet
water and a secret passage.
You've seen Shelly.
- Absolutely.
She had to get to the ice ocean.
I understood nothing of it.
But yes, I do not know,
I'm just a bird.
I need to get up there fast.
- Wait. It is very cold there.
Please. Tell me how I do.
This current, you're
in, so you will go.
I would just not stay too long, otherwise
frozen you may not be too attractive.
I have to fly, I have an
date with a pelican.
Funny how things repeat
themselves.
I think it's all to do with circumstances
and how you looked at it.
This time I was sure
happy to see a bird.
Hey there, little guy.
What's that you're riding on?
No idea.
The Humans threw it away.
I think it's kind of a boat.
- It looks pretty seaworthy.
What brings you to these waters?
You're very far from home.
I know.
I'm so cold.
Maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for ...
Look out. Diving.
You can not do this.
You violate the law.
The world is watching them.
Hey, look over there.
It is a green turtle.
Have you found one yet?
- Yes, you believe it?
What are they doing in this part of the world
- the climate changing, but turtles in Antarctica?
That's pretty crazy.
Shelly.
We'll give a last checkup in Monteray
and then tag her and she can go.
Yeah, I was right.
It is you!
I gotta get outta here.
Come on. Open up.
Shelly.
Calm down.
You're hurting yourself
when you fall.
Well, everyone quiet.
Shelly? Is that you?
Not today.
- Sorry, I thought you
were someone else.
Do you know what will happen to us
- I heard Humans talking
about this place.
They gonna take good care of us.
Put a tag and release us in the ocean
I say relax and enjoy the food.
They make wonderful
burito's I heard.
Sacre blue. Look who it is.
You are so fat, mon ami.
- Is that you, Fluffy.
But of course I do.
I look not as good as ever?
I would be mad at you because you
tricking me on the beach.
Yes, the chicken story.
You got me. I made it all up.
I was still quite insecure.
Thou hast no feeling
of revenge, eh?
No, it's good to see you, Fluffy.
- Mutual.
How did you get here
- I was nearly frozen
in the ice ocean.
Really?
So you have done?
You explores the world?
Yes.
- You sound is not very happy about it.
Why?
Long story.
Talk about stories.
I have missed you
when I read Snow.
Snow's here
- Yes, somewhere.
Shelly.
- Who is that?
Does not matter.
You gotta help me
get out of here.
Now.
Quiet. Turtles have always in a hurry.
- Fluffy.
What do you want me to do
- make the door open.
Why do animals fall
hard, Fluffy?
Unbelievable.
Fluffy, did you recognize him?
Our small peace ambassador.
Look at you, kid.
Grew up. What happened to you?
How did you get here?
I was afraid you would not
make it, when I left.
It is so good to see you.
I know, you want to quickly
back into the sea.
We'll let you go fast enough,
but first we'll highlight.
I need some stuff from the other building here.
It was fun to see
you, it Fluffy?
I'll be back.
Fluffy, come on.
- Stand back, I open the door.
Stop.
Fluffy, go play outside.
Leave the animals alone.
Sorry, buddy.
Here we go.
Go ahead mate and stay away
from the cold weather.
Goodbye.
For a turtle, the chances of survival
in the ocean rather small.
Shelly and I managed it by a number
of difficult situations ...
with occasional help
from the Humans.
But one way or another, no matter how hard
we tried, it kept us separated fate.
You must help us.
- What?
He's trapped, he can not roll over.
- Who?
Hurry, follow us.
We have found someone who can help.
- Good, because this thing
goes like this fall.
Could not you find?
You had me just as well
to make a shrimp.
He is too small, what can he do now?
How can it help me?
Stop moving.
You push yourself over the precipice
and it's done with you.
Wait a minute, you
sound familiar.
Come here.
Come on.
Come closer, I can
see you better.
Turn my shield, because
I can not believe it.
Sammy. Sammy, it's you
- Ray. I thought you ...
Anything. Turtle soup, right?
How did you escape?
- Ray do not just stop,
you know that?
You need to keep quiet.
They found me, threw me in the aasemmer.
... Good baits also
because I was starving.
After I had eaten all the
bait, I jumped out.
We were miles apart.
I've given myself to blame.
He falls down if you
do not lash out.
I can do this.
How did you get in the way ended up
- Okay, I'll tell you.
It was full of frozen squid.
I thought it easy to retrieve.
But it slipped away, and when I was stuck.
Then I them one at a dinner.
I'm quite struck and
became thicker.
No more talking.
It's time to get out of it.
Quiet, Sammy. Quiet.
- Do not move, Ray.
He's going to break.
- Get me out of here, Sammy.
I knew you were my shield
was covered.
Ladies, my heart is completely
filled with gratitude for you.
Your courage is only surpassed
by your collective beauty.
Gab, Ray.
- Thank you.
Besides the obvious reason,
it is good to see you.
It was long ago.
- What are you doing
here all alone?
That's a long story.
- Where have I heard
that before?
I need your help, Ray.
- We are practically brothers.
What do you need?
I need to find someone, someone
very special to me.
The trick is to know
where to look.
And in this time of year, but they can in one place.
And that is ...
The magical place.
It shines there is always the case.
You would never leave.
This is incredible.
- If you are looking for a
friend, you must be here.
I'm back.
- What? Ray, where were you?
I was stuck, so to speak.
And then I came to my
old friend Sammy.
Sammy? Really?
- The one and only.
Hi Rita, very nice to meet you.
- I thought you were dead.
Ray always thought ...
Yes, I know, turtle soup.'s Great that
you have tamed his wild hair.
He's cute.
Hey, calm down ladies.
He already has a girlfriend.
Where is she?
I would love to meet her.
I wish I knew.
- Why we are here.
We have to find her.
They were a while ago
got separated.
Poor baby.
- They seek each other
all the time al
How romantic.
- She's a shark bit her shield.
Has anyone seen her?
- I think so. What is her name?
Shelly.
- Yeah, that's it.
Where have you seen her? Where'd she go?
- I'm sure she's in there.
What are you waiting for.
Let's find her, friend.
No, nothing of it.
- But baby from me.
You stay nice here.
- Sammy needs me.
You have him here, now
it's up to him.
Well, all right.
I'm here if needed.
You can find her, Sammy.
Love always finds a way.
Shelly.
Shelly.
What is it? Did you not find her
- She is here indeed ...
but she has a boyfriend.
- Are you sure?
Yes, I saw them together,
behind the ship.
I'm really sorry, Sammy.
- What you gonna do?
I know you do not want to think about it, but
there are plenty of other turtles here.
Stop it, Ray.
That he wants to hear.
Ray, you're back. How are you?
Could be better.
- Hey, Rita.
Robbie, Clara is
looking for you.
That will be best.
With all these beautiful girls here, she does
not want me around too much swimming.
I better go, see you later.
You two, take it easy,
you get me.
Who is Clara?
- Robbie's girlfriend.
I thought ... Shelly and Robbie
- Friends were?
Yes, it looked for me.
Robbie?
Flirting with every
girl says hello.
Therefore Clara keeps it
securely on a leash.
That is really something for Robbie.
- I should do the same with you.
I like a dog?
But baby you know you're
the only one.
This means that Shelly may
not yet be boyfriend.
Maybe you're right.
What should I do
- I would not wait.
But ... what if they do not
- if they what?
Wants him as her boyfriend.
- Wait a minute.
I got it. I have an idea.
This is what you should do:
You need a large entry.
Albert is still around?
- Yes.
What crazy idea do you now
- trust me.
Thank you, that was very brave of you.
- I was finally in place ...
at the right time.
- Sammy?
How did you find me? Watch out.
Behind you.
It's okay. He's a friend.
What happens here
- maybe this was a bad idea.
Now I understand.
- After what happened to
the secret passage ...
I was not sure if ...
- Or what?
Whether we belong together.
- Come here you.
I suck, my shield week.
- That's okay, honey.
Before you know I have a pink dot on my tail.
I'm so sensitive.
The day I was born, it seemed
that I did not get ...
and I had no idea what
I was supposed to do.
Ray, let me see joy and meaning
of true friendship.
And then I met Shelly, which I completed.
She gives my life meaning.
And that is in every
way, fantastic.
As for the Humans, admittedly,
we still need their help.
To protect us and to our oceans
alive and well keep.
It seems the kids have
come good this time.
Yes, if it looks off.
Where would we meet
the women again?
In Tristan da Cunha.
- Tristan, what?
Somewhere in the middle of nowhere.
- And the Humans?
What can I say.
You know they are everywhere.
I take care of this.
- Go ahead.
Hello, is anybody there?
Hi, there.
- Hey. I can not get out.
Can you help me
- I know exactly how you feel.
Let me give you a nudge,
so you can escape.
The first steps are always the hardest.
- What do I do?
Just put one flipper in front of the other
and you'll be... alright.
