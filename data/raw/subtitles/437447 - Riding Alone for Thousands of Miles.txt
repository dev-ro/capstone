For unexplainable reasons...
my son Ken-ichi and I...
have been estranged for 10 years.
There is a profound chasm between us...
which hurts me deeply.
I want us to be close again.
I have learned that...
Ken-ichi is in the hospital.
His wife Rie has asked me to visit him.
She has suggested to me...
that it would be an opportunity...
for Ken-ichi and I to speak to each other...
and to improve our relationship.
Hence I have come to Tokyo.
You must be surprised at the changes...
in Tokyo over the past 10 years.
Ken-ichi has been unwell for awhile.
He's suffering from stomach pain.
It often disturbs him at night.
He hasn't been diagnosed yet.
Excuse me.
Give me a moment.
I'll tell Ken-ichi you're here.
He doesn't know that you've come.
Father is here to see you.
Why don't you let him in?
He's come a long way to see you.
Why should I see him?
Who asked him to come?
Did you?
I never said I wanted to see him.
Please don't talk like this.
"Enough, I don't want to see him."
Father.
Please wait.
Father...
he's sick and in great pain.
Don't take his words to heart.
Forgive him.
Let me talk to him.
This tape...
was made by Ken-ichi in China.
It was broadcast as part of a TV special.
Please have a look at his work.
Make sure you watch it.
Please.
"Mr Takata, it's ready."
Thank you. Would you like a drink?
"No, thank you."
I have another appointment.
Do you know how to use a VCR?
Yes.
Let me introduce...
an expert in oriental folk arts...
Mr Ken-ichi Takata.
He is widely published on the subject.
We have some footage...
shot by Mr Ken-ichi of a mask opera.
This opera originates from Yunnan Province.
This is Mr Ken-ichi Takata...
from the faculty of Oriental Folk Arts...
at the University of Tokyo.
He's here to see you perform.
Thank you.
This is Mr Li Jiamin.
He's our lead singer.
This is amazing.
You are incredible.
He says you are incredible.
I could be better. I have a cold today.
Come back and I'll perform...
Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles.
I'm not familiar with this particular opera.
It's a mask opera about Lord Guan.
Oh... I see... the Lord Guan...
from the story...
""The Romance of the Three Kingdoms"?"
He actually knows...
who Lord Guan is.
Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles...
is the greatest of all mask operas.
I'm the greatest singer of it.
"Then, this is a rare chance."
Can't you sing a little for me now?
My voice is not up to it today.
Ken-ichi is leaving China tonight.
"Then, some other time."
It's a deal.
I'll come back to Yunnan next year.
I promise you an unforgettable performance.
How's the catch today?
Nothing much.
This is Takata.
Father...
I've been calling and calling.
Have you been fishing?
I've received Ken-ichi's diagnosis.
Cancer of the liver.
It is terminal.
I haven't told Ken-ichi yet.
I don't think... I have the courage.
He thinks...
he will be discharged soon.
I've always hoped... in my heart...
that our family could enjoy a meal together...
Father...
Ken-ichi...
and I.
Now I'm not sure...
that's going to happen.
I need to find...
the singer Mr Li Jiamin.
I don't know what is out there...
and I'm not good at dealing with people.
However...
I feel compelled to go.
I need to do something for my dying son.
Mr Takata.
Do you want to rest in Kunming...
or go to Lijiang immediately?
"Lijiang, immediately."
Fine.
LIJIANG
Rie?
It's me.
I'm at Lijiang...
"in Yunnan Province, China."
Yunnan?
What are you doing there?
"I'm filming "Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles"."
You want to film it...
for Ken-ichi?
Actually...
I gave you that tape...
so you could learn more about him.
Father...
please come back.
No.
The travel agency has arranged everything.
Please don't be worried about me.
Just don't tell Ken-ichi...
what I'm planning.
Please.
LI VILLAGE
Mr Takata.
This is Lingo. He's a village tour guide.
He speaks a little Japanese.
Lingo.
Remember Ken-ichi was here last year?
He promised to film the mask opera.
This is his father.
So you're Ken-ichi's father.
His father.
Ken-ichi is... my friend.
He's a very... good friend.
"Lingo, how is everything going?"
Just a second.
Are you Li Jiamin?
No.
"Lingo, I told you we only wanted Li."
It doesn't have to be Li.
Other actors can also play Lord Guan.
No way. Mr Takata only wants Li Jiamin.
If he insists on Li...
there will be no show today.
Why not?
"Look, Li enjoys a drink or two..."
which is usually fine.
"Then, during a rehearsal..."
a stage hand mentioned...
he had a bastard son.
This upset him so much...
that he grabbed a wooden dagger...
and stabbed the guy in the face.
He was arrested...
and sentenced to 3 years in prison.
Please tell him...
it doesn't have to be Li Jiamin performing.
All the actors are very good.
Once the mask is on...
it doesn't matter who is behind it.
No-one can tell the difference.
Even a native can't tell...
the difference between the voices.
So how could a Japanese person?
Does it really have to be Li?
His son wanted to film Li.
He is making this film for his son.
No-one else will do.
But Li Jiamin is in prison...
for 3 years.
Even if he behaves well...
and becomes a model prisoner...
he won't be released for a year or two.
Takata should come back.
There will be other chances.
The show is always playing.
Jasmine...
please help me.
"Mr Takata, this is not about money."
I'm in a difficult position.
I'm just a tour guide.
How can I get a foreigner...
permission to film inside a prison?
It is impossible.
Please help me.
I really want to help.
But this is beyond my ability...
and my job description.
Please forgive me.
My contract is only for 3 days.
I've been assigned other jobs.
I'll see you off at Kunming Airport.
I'm sorry.
Jasmine...
please ask your boss...
if I could employ another interpreter.
"Hi, Boss. This is Jasmine."
That Japanese tourist...
"Mr Takata, who arrived 2 days ago..."
is asking for a new interpreter.
Mr Takata...
my boss cannot help with your plan...
to film inside the prison.
He also says...
he doesn't have another interpreter available.
Please forget about this idea.
Mr Takata.
"Is that actor, Mr Li, so important..."
to your film?
Excuse me.
Please turn around.
Turn around.
Turn around.
Jasmine...
he wants to go back.
The opera is...
Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles.
Lord Guan travelled a thousand miles...
to help a friend...
which is a big deal.
A man must be loyal.
I can't understand what they are saying...
but I need their help.
"Without them, I can't go anywhere."
"For the first time, I feel helpless."
I wonder if Ken-ichi would feel the same way.
Mr Takata...
about your plan...
Jasmine cannot help you...
but I am able to.
Much obliged.
Thank you.
No problem.
There are no costumes...
or props in the prison.
We'll have to take them.
Excuse me.
There are no props and costumes at the prison.
He's getting them.
Mr Takata...
I must confide in you.
Lingo is my friend.
He is very enthusiastic...
but he really doesn't know much.
"So, let me tell you..."
the basic procedures to follow.
Please write them down.
"First, go to the Office of Foreign Affairs."
Tell them why you want to visit the prison.
Office of Foreign Affairs.
If they approve...
then go to the Bureau of Justice.
Bureau of Justice.
If they approve...
then all's well.
Bureau of Justice... approves...
If you have any difficulties...
or Lingo can't properly translate for you...
please call me.
I'll translate for you over the phone.
You have my phone number.
I'll leave this car for you...
and charge it to your account.
You need to sign this form.
It's your request to change the interpreter.
Please sign here.
OFFICE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Director Li is in a meeting.
He's been briefed on your situation.
He will be available soon.
He won't be long.
We have to wait.
"Lingo, are they all... thank-you banners?"
Yes.
"This means Â“Thank you"."
It's calligraphy.
A Chinese tradition.
Tradition?
Lingo...
Please.
Write them down?
Please sit down.
No need to get up.
I've checked the files.
Indeed...
there was a Japanese man named Ken-ichi...
who  here frequently.
He enjoyed our mask opera immensely.
He also visited Li Village.
You are?
I'm a tour guide from Li Village.
I'm Lingo.
He is my client.
This is Ken-ichi's father.
Welcome.
Please have a seat.
"Lingo, can you translate..."
everything I am saying?
My Japanese is not very fluent...
but I can take notes and translate later.
"Okay, I'll talk and you take notes."
Okay.
You see...
to let someone film inside a prison...
is very difficult.
His request is totally without precedent...
which makes it even more difficult.
You know...
for a foreigner to visit a prison...
is not a straightforward matter.
Even if it was...
the procedures are complicated.
"It may seem simple, but it's not."
It is very complex.
"Okay, okay, I'm coming."
"So, that puts an end to it."
Lingo...
please explain these difficulties to him.
He doesn't have to visit this prisoner.
Many singers can perform this opera.
They could be even better than Li Jiamin.
I advise him to stop trying.
All right?
Mr Li said...
this is...
too difficult.
Because...
a foreigner...
I'm a foreigner.
Law...
Law is...
difficult.
Because...
Difficult?
Time
no time.
Dictionary...
Check...
Please check.
Law...
Law?
Difficult?
Difficult law.
Difficult law.
Easy for the Chinese...
but for foreigners...
"very, very difficult."
Government... law.
Government... law.
Hello.
"Hello, Jasmine."
Sorry to bother you.
I need you to translate for me.
This is Lingo.
How did it go?
It was a disaster.
Get him a ticket and send him home.
That's the end of it.
Let me explain this to him.
"Mr Takata, telephone."
Mr Takata...
I'm sorry. Your request was refused.
Lingo will book you on the next flight.
Thank you.
Mr Takata...
goodbye.
Please return to Japan.
Because... government policy.
My Japanese...
is not good.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
You want silk banners?
Which one?
The best one.
These are the best. What size?
This one.
Director Li.
Lingo.
I've been waiting for hours.
We had a long meeting.
I forgot about the video.
Let's have a look at this tape.
Let's go in.
Why does Mr Takata...
want to use this tape...
to talk to me?
Lingo...
we don't understand Japanese.
No problem.
I have a Chinese version.
Jasmine translated it...
and faxed it to me.
That's complicated.
Of course it is.
I've been practising for hours.
Let's see it then.
Why isn't he talking?
Director Li...
Forgive me for speaking to you like this...
but I have no other option.
A long time ago...
a long time ago...
I hurt my son Ken-ichi deeply.
He has never forgiven me.
Recently...
my son was diagnosed with cancer.
He may not have very long to live.
He has a deep passion for...
Chinese folk operas.
He promised to return here this year...
to film Li Jiamin's performance.
I don't know at this point...
what else I can do for my son.
"Maybe filming "Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles"..."
is the only thing I can do for him now.
"Director Li, please help me."
Please.
Director Li...
please.
I apologize for calling you so late.
Please help me.
If you think it's possible...
I'll report it to the Bureau of Foreign Affairs...
and ask them...
to liaise with the Bureau of Justice...
to resolve this.
Can you help me with this?
PRISON
Reform our ways.
Redeem ourselves.
Become new people.
"One, two, three, four."
Are you his interpreter?
"Yes, but my Japanese is not good."
I'll make notes first...
and get someone to translate later.
Let me explain our protocol.
Foreigners have filmed here...
in the past...
but then complained publicly about conditions.
This gives our country a bad image.
Tell him this.
Yes.
Troublemakers like that are not welcome.
I have nothing against him personally.
You only want to film one prisoner?
Yes.
Prisoner Li Jiamin?
"That's right, Li."
Mr Li Jiamin.
Just to film him singing?
"Yes, nothing else."
Which opera?
Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles.
It sounds like an excellent way...
to promote Chinese culture.
"After all, Lord Guan is not a state secret."
"No, he's not."
He's certainly not.
I'll give it the Bureau's stamp of approval.
We can film it now.
"Testing, do you hear me?"
Yes.
Perfect.
This is the venue.
It is our recreation room.
The prisoners...
use the room...
on weekends and public holidays.
It's a place to relax.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
You can begin now.
"Thank you, Warden Chen."
You're welcome.
Report for duty.
Come in.
Prisoner Yang and the band...
"reporting for duty, Sir."
Take your places.
"Yes, Sir."
Lingo.
This is the prison band.
Some were professionals...
others learnt to play here.
They are extremely popular...
performing every year for festivals.
Please tell him.
Thank you. Thank you.
"Reporting for duty, Sir. Come in."
Prisoner Li Jiamin...
"reporting for duty, Sir."
Li.
"Can you sing Â“Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles"?"
Yes.
What you need to do...
is this...
Repent of our sins.
Reform our ways.
Redeem ourselves...
become new people.
Li.
"Relax, don't be nervous."
You should be captured on film at your best.
"You know all the pieces, right?"
"Come on, don't be nervous."
"Band members, once again."
Ready... go.
"What's the matter with you, Li?"
Why aren't you singing?
Li.
Li.
What's wrong?
He is waiting for you.
He came all the way from Japan...
just to film you singing.
He's Ken-ichi's father.
The Japanese guy who visited you often.
Please sing.
Ken-ichi is sick.
Please sing for him.
Come on.
Why are you crying?
I'm not in the mood for singing.
I just can't.
I'm thinking of my son.
I can't stop thinking about him.
I envy Li.
He doesn't hide his feelings.
It is a blessing...
to be able to express one's emotions.
If I could reveal my feelings like this...
my relationship with Ken-ichi would be different...
Lingo.
I don't think...
we can film the opera today.
Li cannot sing.
Tell Mr Takata to come back.
Let me know well in advance.
Please tell him.
Mr Takata.
"Stop crying, Li."
We know youÂ’d like to see your son.
This is Takata.
I don't understand what's going on here.
Can you please help me?
Are you at the prison?
What happened?
We couldn't film the opera.
Li couldn't stop crying.
As the music started...
he began to cry.
Why?
He's upset about his son...
who he's never seen.
He longs to meet his son.
The warden stopped everything...
when he saw Li crying.
What will you do?
He couldn't sing.
Li wasn't like that before.
He is a different man in prison.
Please pass the phone to Takata.
I'll explain to him.
"Mr Takata, your phone."
It's me.
Jasmine.
This is Takata.
Mr Takata.
Sorry to disturb you so late.
I've been thinking.
I've decided to bring Li's son to him.
You want to bring the boy to Li?
Yes.
"Please reconsider, Mr Takata."
Li was over emotional today.
Warden Chen said...
he'd be fine in a few days.
The boy lives in Stone Village.
It is in a very remote place.
This detour will only delay your plan.
I've made up my mind.
Mr Takata.
Isn't making the film for Ken-ichi...
the most important thing?
Both are of equal importance now.
I'm sorry.
Please call Lingo now...
and ask him to take me to Stone Village tomorrow.
"Please, I'm sorry."
All right.
Lingo.
Good evening. May I?
Please.
What is it?
Good night.
Goodbye.
Hello.
Is this Mr Takata?
Sorry to bother you again.
What did you say to Lingo?
Why did he...
return the money to me?
Will he still help me tomorrow?
Mr Takata.
Let me explain.
Lingo and I feel very sad...
about Ken-ichi's illness.
I apologize...
for not helping you earlier.
Forgive me.
Never mind.
I understand.
Lingo doesn't feel right...
about taking your money...
when your son is so sick.
He will still take you...
to Stone Village tomorrow.
Really?
Thank you both.
I'm happy that Ken-ichi...
has friends like you.
Does he have many friends in China?
Actually... I don't know Ken-ichi.
Lingo doesn't know him very well either.
Lingo said that...
Ken-ichi hardly has any friends in China.
Really?
Lingo said...
Ken-ichi seldom spoke to anyone.
He would stay alone in Lijiang for months.
Sometimes he just stared for hours...
at the mountains.
He seemed very lonely.
I may have said too much.
No.
Please...
tell me more about my son.
"Mr Takata, I'm afraid that's all I know."
I am sorry.
Never mind.
I'm sorry it's so late.
"Thank you, Jasmine."
Good night.
There's road work ahead.
STONE VILLAGE
Yang Yang's mom died a week ago.
He has no other family to care for him.
The villagers are taking care of him now.
The village chief said...
the boy is now being raised by everyone...
in this village.
That's right.
Li was told about this.
That's why he broke down in prison.
This was the reason.
We know why you have come here.
Our committee has already made its decision...
I cannot give you the details straight away.
Why not?
Before I explain...
I must clarify some things.
Please translate what I say.
Of course I will.
He's my client.
Please continue.
I want to say two things.
Firstly...
Yang Yang is Li's son...
born outside of wedlock...
but we all accept that.
We all agree.
This is the first point.
Secondly...
"After 8 years, Li has now decided to claim his son."
We don't have a problem with this.
You'd better translate now.
"Why don't you simply say "yes" or "no"?"
So I can give him an answer now.
"Yes or "no"?"
You haven't translated a single word to him.
You should translate everything I've said.
You should make yourself clear before I do.
I doubt you speak any Japanese.
Ridiculous. Of course I do.
This loud discussion is going on for a long time.
I suddenly feel like an outsider.
I realize...
in a foreign language environment...
you can feel very isolated.
I'm slowly...
beginning to understand...
why Ken-ichi often visits here.
You're supposed to be a translator.
I wouldn't need you if I spoke Japanese.
I know how to translate.
I beg to differ on that.
No signal.
There's no signal here.
I know where you can get one.
He's calling a translator.
Let's go outside.
Why are we going to the roof?
You can get a stronger signal.
My son has made calls from up here before.
Who is Mr Takata calling?
"Jasmine, a translator from Kunming."
Isn't that your job?
Are you sure you speak Japanese?
Of course I do.
The issue is so important...
we need to get a true professional.
Jasmine.
I'm sorry.
I don't understand what is being said.
Can you translate for me?
Thank you.
Ms Translator.
I want to make two points.
"Firstly, Li didn't register a legal marriage..."
before his son was born.
We all accept that...
Yang Yang is Li's son.
This is point one.
Secondly...
at 8 years of age the boy...
now finds he's got a father.
Li's sudden interest is hard to believe...
and is confusing for everyone.
Please translate this for him.
It's me.
I totally understand...
their reservations.
"I never said "no" on this matter."
Lingo can't speak a word of Japanese.
Mr Takata needed to know...
our feelings on the subject.
Now he really understands...
we are very relieved.
We have no more issues.
"After much discussion, we give our consent..."
to let the boy go. Not for Li's sake...
but for the sake of our Japanese friend.
Yang Yang can visit his father...
with Mr Takata tomorrow.
Yang Yang.
This is Yang Yang.
You are going to town tomorrow.
Get him some new clothes.
Could you ask the Chief...
if Yang Yang wants to see his father?
Chief...
he asks...
if Yang Yang wants to see his father.
No problem.
Of course he does.
No problem.
Sure?
Yes.
One moment.
I have to take a call.
This is Rie.
"Father, please don't be upset."
I've told Ken-ichi...
about your trip to China.
He didn't say a word the whole night...
after he heard this...
but he looked different.
I could see a change in his eyes.
Father...
he never expected that...
you would do such a thing for him.
Ken-ichi told me today...
this particular piece of mask opera...
is not that important to him.
He was only being polite to Li.
"So, Father, please come back."
Father...
can you hear me?
I am listening.
Father...
please come home.
Ken-ichi said...
your trip to China...
is the most wonderful thing...
you've done for him.
Did Ken-ichi say that?
Yes...
these are his exact words.
Thank you.
Standing here today...
I'm not sure...
if Ken-ichi has uttered these words.
If he has...
it is the first compliment...
from my son in many years.
Seeing this large banquet...
prepared by the villagers...
for me... a total stranger...
I am deeply touched.
I will never forget this.
The sight of such generosity...
and kindness from the villagers...
makes me want to believe...
that Ken-ichi has said these words.
What's wrong?
The tractor's broken down.
Broken down.
Really?
Yes
Can you fix it?
I think so. Let me try.
Yang Yang!
Yang Yang!
Lingo!
Lingo!
Yang Yang! Mr Takata!
Yang Yang!
Mr Takata!
Mr Takata!
Yang Yang.
What's the matter?
Why did you run away from us?
Do you know your way home?
Going home?
Your home.
Why are you running away?
Yang Yang.
Do you know where you're going?
Yang Yang...
are you going home?
Is this the right direction?
Hurry up everyone!
It seems like hours.
All I can do is to follow Yang Yang around.
I'm one step behind. I think...
the way I'm chasing after him...
is the way I chase after my own son.
I don't know...
which path to take...
or what direction to go.
I have no idea.
Yang Yang.
We've been here before.
The trail looks the same.
Do you see?
Yang Yang.
We are lost.
We are very lost.
We can't keep going like this.
Let's wait for someone to find us.
All right.
Let's find a place to rest.
Let's wait here...
and stay out of the wind.
Yang Yang.
What are you doing?
Having a poo-poo?
I thought you were running off again.
Don't look.
I can't do it if you watch.
Go away.
I don't believe this.
Go away.
Go away.
I'm not leaving.
I'll stay here.
Go away.
Stop doing that!
Stop doing that!
Go away.
Yang Yang.
Yang Yang.
Hold on...
let's split into two groups to search.
That would be more efficient.
"All right, let's do it."
"Lingo, how do you pronounce his name?"
Mr Takata.
Are you sure?
Of course. It's a simple name.
Can you teach everyone to say it?
It's pronounced as Mr Takata.
Repeat with me.
Mr Takata.
Mr Takata.
Say it louder. Mr Takata.
Mr Takata!
All right.
You lead them that way.
We'll go this way.
Keep yelling out their names.
Let's go.
Mr Takata!
Yang Yang!
The moon is bright in the sky.
"Don't be afraid, Yang Yang."
I'm sure they'll find us.
We have to get their attention.
They might not see us in here.
Lingo!
"Here, I've got a boat whistle."
Well done.
"Well done, Yang Yang."
"No, you keep it."
Blow it again.
Well done.
Well done.
Sitting here all night...
waiting to be found...
I'm holding Yang Yang tightly in my arms.
I don't remember...
if Ken-ichi and I
have ever held...
each other like this.
Yang Yang...
has no idea what his father even looks like.
I wonder...
what kind of father I am to Ken-ichi?
His blood pressure is normal.
You will be fine.
Thank you.
Not at all.
I need to check the boy.
Give me your hand.
Jasmine...
could I talk to the Chief please?
I am sorry for causing all this trouble.
No problem.
May I ask...
why Yang Yang ran away yesterday?
He often wanders away.
I am not so sure.
Shall we ask Yang Yang?
Maybe he doesn't want to see his father after all.
There is no need to ask.
We'll make the decision for him.
What the hell does a child know?
He has to do as we say.
She can't translate if you're all speaking at once
Shut up. You can't speak Japanese anyway.
I can't? Can you?
You know I can't. Neither can you!
They're arguing again.
We should ask Yang Yang what he wants.
"Okay, let me ask him."
"Yang Yang, come."
Sit over here.
Let me ask you something.
Do you want to meet your dad?
Do you?
Come on. Yes or no?
No.
Why not?
Don't be naughty.
I am not going!
Why?
Tell me why not?
You must do as the adults say.
I'm telling you to go.
Go now.
He's not my dad.
I've never seen him before.
He is your dad no matter what.
I'm not going.
Why don't you want to see your dad?
I just don't.
Why don't you want to see him?
He's your dad.
Don't be naughty.
Yang Yang doesn't want to go.
You must do as we say.
I will not go.
Why not?
Tell me.
Could I speak with the Chief?
"Chief, could you please come here?"
Let's talk over there.
Don't cry Yang Yang.
We are not going.
Don't cry.
Chief...
everyone...
I'm sorry for causing you any trouble.
I've decided not to take Yang Yang to the prison.
Yang Yang...
might not be ready...
to meet his father yet.
Although he is just a child...
I think we should try to understand...
and respect his wishes on this.
All right.
Yang Yang will not go.
Who will raise Yang Yang now?
Tell him not to worry.
The village will keep caring for Yang Yang.
Li will be released in 2 years.
We'll arrange a meeting then.
The boy will be united with his dad.
We will take care of it.
"Jasmine, one moment."
Yang Yang!
Mr Takata...
what do you want to do now?
I would like to visit the prison again.
If possible...
I'd still like to film Li's performance.
Could you contact Warden Chen...
to see if Li would be willing?
You may have to wait a few days for an answer
I'll wait.
All right.
Father.
Father...
I've been trying to contact you for hours...
but I couldn't get through.
Ken-ichi...
passed away...
last night.
Yesterday during the day...
Ken-ichi...
was in high spirits.
He talked about you...
and wanted to write you a letter.
He spoke. I wrote it down.
I wrote down... every word he said.
Shall I read it to you?
Do you want to listen to it now?
"Please, read it to me Rie."
What do I want to say?
What should I say to my father?
I'm asking myself.
I deeply regret refusing to see you...
when you came to the hospital.
This feeling of regret...
torments me more than my illness.
I've been blaming you...
ever since Mother's death.
Without any explanation...
you moved away to a remote fishing village.
I thought then...
you were trying to avoid facing reality.
To be honest...
I've been trying to escape it as well.
When you came to the hospital...
I couldn't face the distance between us.
People have never understood...
my obsession with folk opera.
I've been drawn to them...
because they mirror my life.
I've come to realize...
that I'm the actor behind...
the mask.
I've tried to fool myself...
and everyone close to me.
My true feelings...
have eluded me until now.
I have not allowed myself...
to acknowledge them.
"Father,"
it's not the opera that is important.
I now see...
that loved ones...
should not mask their true feelings for one another
I eagerly wait for your return.
Father...
I want us to embrace each other once again.
Mr Takata. Lingo.
Jasmine?
Hello Warden Chen.
Mr Takata.
I'm sorry that last time...
Li couldn't sing.
I've organized more people this time...
to create a crowd to cheer him on.
I hope it will go well today.
Li.
"Yes, sir."
Tell Mr Takata what you want to say.
"Mr Takata, I'm sorry about last time."
I'll do my best this time.
Warden Chen...
thank you for arranging this.
It's very kind of you.
"Today, however..."
I am not here to film the opera.
I've waited for two days...
just to meet Mr Li.
May I have a few words with him?
Of course.
Mr Li...
I've been to Stone Village.
I've met Yang Yang.
You saw Yang Yang?
He is a good boy. He really is.
Warden Chen...
I've taken some photos of his son.
May I show him?
What photos?
Photos of his son and the village.
Photos of his son?
Please show us.
That's all.
Sorry these are all I have.
Li...
Mr Takata travelled a great distance...
to take these photos for you.
Your son is a bright boy.
Everyone would agree with me.
He is really delightful.
You should thank Mr Takata.
"Thank you, Mr Takata."
Can you perform?
I'll sing to the best of my ability.
There is really no need to perform.
I didn't come to film the opera today.
Mr Takata...
I've arranged the band...
and the crowd.
A lot of men in our region...
can sing mask opera.
I've picked some good ones...
to accompany him.
I hope you stay for the opera.
There's really no need for me to film it.
Let me put it this way.
You don't have to film it.
We invite you to be our audience.
We'll perform the opera.
"Please, will you sit here and watch?"
Mr Takata...
thank you.
You are a very kind man.
"So is your son, Ken-ichi."
I'll perform well.
Please film my performance...
and show it to Ken-ichi.
Please tell him...
to visit us again.
Mr Li...
I will film your performance.
Ken-ichi would be very pleased.
"Thank you, Mr Takata."
