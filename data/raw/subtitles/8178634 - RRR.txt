Swinging off branches, playing in valleys
I should be coddled
In my mother's lap every day
The nightingale that sings
From behind the tree
Should be with me as it reciprocates
With a cuckoo whenever I call her
Each day as it dawns
Mother, I should walk in your footsteps
Swinging off branches, playing in valleys
I should be coddled
In my mother's lap every day
A good day of hunting, my dear?
Yes, it was rather.
Do you believe it?
It's amazing. Who's the artist?
What? This chit of a girl?
I want to have this little package
on our mantelpiece.
- Edward.
- Yes, sir.
The lady is giving you a token
of appreciation for your child's song.
Take it, Loki.
At your service, milady.
At your service, my Lord.
Malli.
Loki, the money they gave you
was not for the song.
They've bought your daughter with it.
Malli!
Malli... Malli!
Malli... Malli...
My child.
Please give me back my child.
I beg you!
I beg you.
I fall at your feet.
Sergeant!
Do you comprehend the value
of the bullet in your barrel?
It was manufactured in an English factory
using English metals.
It crossed the seven seas
in an English vessel.
By the time it reached
the barrel of your gun,
it cost One Pound.
One Pound Sterling!
And you would want to squander it on
brown rubbish?
Clear the road.
Please don't take my child away…
I'm begging you…
Give me my child...
Release our leader, Lala Lajpat Rai!
Otherwise we'll burn down
this police station!
Release our leader, Lala Lajpat Rai!
Of course not, sir.
We have done nothing to aggravate them.
They are protesting here
because Lala Lajpat Rai
was arrested in Calcutta.
They're rabid!
We need reinforcements now!
It's going to take another seven hours.
Hold the line, damn it!
Let's burn them down!
Arrest that bastard!
And…
…bring him to me.
You bastard! Traitor!
You filthy traitor!
Arrest that bastard!
And bring him to me.
Arrest that bastard!
And bring him to me.
Snatch his lathi!
Good God!
That mob!
I was scared out of my wits, sir!
He scares me more.
On the occasion of the annual
special officers' ceremony,
only three have been deemed worthy
out of 75 candidates
for their exceptional contribution.
They are Philip Anderson,
Charles Langford,
Frank Poole.
As for the rest of you,
better luck next year.
Disperse!
Greetings, sir.
He is Mr. Venkat Avadhani.
Special adviser to the Nizam.
Governor Scott is not in India.
State the purpose of your visit
to Mr. Edward.
When Governor Scott visited
Adilabad recently
he brought back a little girl.
The Nawab has sent me to tell you
something about it.
It's regarding the girl we brought
from the Deccan.
It is our police department's opinion
that the girl be returned to her village.
It is the Nawab's opinion too.
Why so?
It is a Gond child
that you've brought, sir.
- So?
- So what?
- Do they have two horns on their head?
- No.
They are innocent people.
Even if you oppress them,
they won't raise their voice.
But they have a trait.
They like staying in herds like sheep.
Even if one lamb goes missing,
it causes them great distress.
This is why the herd has a shepherd.
He protects the herd with his life.
So this tribal is going to shoot down
the mighty British empire
with his bow and arrows.
So is this tribal going to take us down?
Don't misunderstand me.
I'm only trying to tell you about him.
The shepherd will travel however far
to retrieve the missing lamb.
Be it morning or night,
sun or rain, rocks, mountains,
valleys, peaks...
He will search every nook and corner.
If he happens to find the lamb
in the tiger's mouth,
he will break its teeth, pry its jaws open
and take the lamb back to its herd.
It seems that the shepherd has come
to Delhi to begin his hunt.
The trap is set.
Alert our brother.
Jangu, it's not a wolf.
It's a tiger.
Jangu!
I am using you for my need.
Forgive me, brother.
We've been searching every corner of Delhi
for six months now.
We are doing everything we can
to find Malli.
Do you think
Malli is alive?
Akthar! Where did you disappear off to?
- That...
- There's a lot of work. Come on.
Give it to me.
Hey! You!
Greetings, sir.
The engine died on me again.
What did you repair?
I've been kicking and kicking
and this damn thing won't start.
Let me check, sir.
It's on reserve, sir.
I'm sorry.
What's the bloody trick?
I didn't do anything, sir.
You removed something earlier
and attached it now
- so that you can charge me again?
- I didn't do anything.
You cheating bastard!
There's no fault of mine, sir.
Sir. Please forgive him, sir.
- I didn't do anything, sir.
- Forgive him, sir.
Sir, sir...
- Please forgive him, sir.
- Robert, please stop it.
I didn't do anything, sir.
This will never happen again!
I beg you.
- Oh, God!
- Lord, have mercy!
Son.
- Careful, son.
- Brother, are you okay?
He is a monster.
Look how badly he has beaten him.
Why are you hiding your anger, son?
If they come to know the truth about me,
they will punish you all
for giving me shelter.
You're protecting me,
an outsider.
I shouldn't cause you any harm.
Come what may, I'll never
let anyone know my true identity.
And that is the gist of it.
We have a hunter targeting the Governor,
roaming free in Delhi.
We shouldn't really be bothering
about imbecile tribes.
However our good friend, the Nizam,
thinks that they might trouble us.
And since this concerns the Governor,
we should act on it.
- And with a good deal of bother.
- Alright, sir.
We will apprehend this bugger.
Though I would rather roast this swine
on a bed of coals.
Well said, sir!
Let us have the file, sir.
Well, yes, that is the catch, officer.
We have nothing on him.
You mean nothing?
Identifying features?
Criminal history?
It's quite an impossible task.
How the hell are we supposed to catch him?
Do they expect us to capture a tribal
with no criminal history?
The one that accomplishes the impossible
will be promoted to the rank
of special officer.
Do you want him dead or alive?
I can vouch for this man.
If anyone can do the job, it's him.
You bring him dead, you receive a bounty.
You bring him alive,
you will be promoted to special officer.
We don't need to search all over Delhi.
What he wants is in Scott's bungalow.
He will be somewhere around there.
He will definitely come there.
How do we find him among so many people?
He will think that his enemy's
enemies are his friends.
We should act like we are with him.
Before we do that,
find out where
all the revolutionaries and rebels
have their meetings.
Bow your heads before you go inside
and stay that way until you come out.
Do your job and leave.
Show me your IDs.
You.
ID.
I forgot it, sir.
- Hey...
- Stop, stop it.
- Stop.
- Forgive me, sir.
- Why are you hitting him like that?
- He's forgotten his ID, ma'am.
That doesn't give you the right
to treat him like an animal.
Sorry, ma'am.
She seems kind-hearted.
We might find a way in
if we befriend that girl.
SHAHEED KARANVEER SINGH ADARSH BHAVAN
DARIYAGANJ DELHI
Freedom is our birthright.
We don't have to beg for our rights.
Let's start teaching our children about
the idea of revolution.
Let's start teaching our children
about revolution.
One moment.
Why beat around the bush?
We should hit them where it hurts.
Let's kill Governor Scott.
Why Scott?
Why don't we just kill King George?
He says that we should kill Scott.
I said that it would be better
to kill King George.
Brother… a-are you serious?
Is it possible to kill Scott?
Why not?
What's your name?
My name is Lacchu.
Scott has done us wrong.
We have come here with our brother.
Can you please help us?
Sure, I will.
Where's your brother?
I... I will take you there.
Come with me.
We have been roaming around everywhere.
We didn't know whom to ask for help.
You appeared like a God...
I am an officer on duty. Do a casual
check and let us pass through.
ID.
- He's an officer.
- Yes, sir.
- Vande Mataram!
- Vande Mataram!
Vande Mataram!
Is this what you've brought?
It's not fresh at all.
I will get you a nice fish.
- Give me some money.
- Hey, come here.
I'll be right back.
Brother! Brother!
What happened?
A policeman.
He chased me like a cheetah.
- A police officer? What have you done!
- Jangu.
Come here.
Tell me.
He looked like one of us.
When I got to know that he is
a police officer, I escaped from him.
If word gets out, we'll all be killed.
Don't come out until I tell you.
Go.
Raju, the snake has gone back
to its burrow. You'll never find it again.
We won't find him.
The promise we made to the village
will be broken.
We won't find Malli.
Oh, no...
Help me! Help me!
Does anybody have anything?
A boat or a rope?
Let's save the child.
- Are you mad?
- No, please don't say that.
He's a child. Let's help him, sir...
Help me! Help me!
VANDE MATARAM
- Raju.
- Akhtar.
Between a tiger and a hunter
Between a head and the guillotine
Between a wildfire
And a storm
Between the sun and the cloud
A new friendship
This is an unforeseen turn of fate
Which has culminated in this friendship
It's yet to be seen if this will end
In bloodshed
Friendship between an erupting volcano
And a wild storm
Friendship between freewill and destiny
This friendship is between opposites...
- My father.
- Greetings.
- My mother.
- Greetings.
Have this.
How many times should I tell you
not to eat with your left hand?
How does it matter
when I'm so hungry, Mom?
What happened?
Nothing. I just remembered something.
Chandni Chowk?
Do you think that is enough for him, Raju?
Don't cast an evil eye on him, Uncle.
An unpredictable gust of wind
Has erased the distance
Between both of them
Will their rivalry ever
Come to the forefront?
Walking the same path
But searching for different things
Won't this friendship break one day
In the form of betrayal?
In the deceptive game of destiny
It is impossible to know what lies
After the next bend in the road
This is an unforeseen turn of fate
Which has culminated in this friendship
It's yet to be seen
If this will end in bloodshed
Hey.
What is that?
Why are you blushing?
Did someone special give you this?
I thought so.
What's her name?
Seetha.
Ram and Seetha.
One hand protects
- Hey! Pull harder!
- And the other kills...
The east and west have come together
When an unpredictable fight happens
Who will decide whose victory it is?
This is an unforeseen turn of fate
Which has culminated in this friendship
It's yet to be seen
If this will end in bloodshed
Raju, what's that in your hand?
It's the sketch of a person
I've been looking for.
Why didn't you ask me?
Oh, yeah! Why didn't I ask you?
Show me. If he is from around here,
I'll recognize him instantly.
Akhtar, is she that beautiful?
She is very beautiful.
Why don't you speak to her?
I would like to.
But I can't find a way.
Brother, to speak to a girl
you shouldn't try to find a way.
You should pave your own path.
You drive the bike.
I'll show you the way.
Akhtar, stop here.
Stop here? But why?
The car will stop here.
Here?
Oh, no.
How did you know that this would happen?
I threw some nails on the road.
The tires are punctured.
Wow! You're so clever.
Now I will repair her tires.
She will thank me.
That way, we can speak to each other.
Is that it?
Excuse me! Could you help?
My tires have gone flat.
Yes, ma'am! Our shop is very close by.
I will patch up your tires
in five minutes.
He means it will take
at least five hours.
Oh!
Is there a bus stop
or a tram station nearby?
She is asking if there's a bus stop
or a tram station nearby.
- Yes. Very close...
- Shake your head no.
Perhaps you can ask him for a ride.
Oh. Are you going that way?
She is asking if you're going that way.
Will you give her a lift?
- No.
- Say yes now. Yes.
Oh. That's a yes?
- Yes.
- Wonderful, let me get my things.
- Can you take me to the market, please?
- Market? Sure.
Thank you.
These are very small, madam.
Your house is very big.
Your... house... house...
Your house is very big.
Oh… you mean our house is big?
It is. But...
Not really beautiful, you know…
Not like a real home.
Can I come to your house, madam?
Can I see your house?
I'm sorry, I can't understand
what you are saying.
What's your name, madam?
Sorry?
Your name…
- Name…
- Oh, you mean my name?
What's your name, madam?
Oh, don't call me madam.
It's just Jenny, yes?
Such a long name!
How do I call you in short, madam?
Don't call me madam.
It is just Jenny, yes?
Don't call me madam.
It is just Jenny, yes.
Don't call me madam.
It is just Jenny, yes.
Oh, no.
This isn't for you.
- It's for kids.
- Oh.
It's not for me… There is
a small girl staying with us…
Malli.
This is for her.
How much does this cost?
I need to make something.
This will go well with that dress.
Oh…
How beautiful!
She is going to love it.
Did you make this?
No, I mean…
Did you make this?
No. I made it.
Good lord! You are safe.
We were worried about you, ma'am.
Why on earth? I am perfectly alright.
Going out with a native can be
dangerous, ma'am.
Please come with me.
- Give me a minute.
- Alright, ma'am.
I would love to see you again.
There is a party at the Gymkhana Club.
This is the invitation.
Please do try to come.
Bye.
Hello, Malli.
Look what I bought for you.
Do you like it?
What about a toy elephant?
A bangle?
Raju! Raju!
I spoke to her.
Yeah? How's your girlfriend?
- What?
- I mean your lover, girlfriend…
Your sweetheart, your darling...
Don't say that. It's wrong.
Wrong?
If she didn't like you,
would she hop on your bike?
I don't know.
Tell me what to do next.
Okay. What's her name?
It's a very long name
but I've memorized it.
Don't call me madam, it is Jenny yes.
Don't call me madam, it is Jenny yes.
That's not her name.
She has told you not to call her madam
but just Jenny.
Oh, Jenny.
It's a short name.
Okay. What else did you talk about?
We spoke a lot.
But while she was leaving,
she said "party, come"
or something like that.
She invited you to a party?
On the first meeting?
- Where, when?
- Here, she gave me this.
Feb 14th... Hey, it's today. Right now.
Stop eating, leave now.
Alone? Why don't you come along?
Okay. I'll come.
Come on.
What? Like this?
It's been so long since I've been
to a party. I simply can't wait to dance.
If you're in need
of a dance partner, Jennifer,
you needn't look any further.
You are looking
at the best dancer around here.
- Oh.
- I second that.
I don't mind teaching you
some good moves...
Akhtar, you look amazing in your suit.
He wanted to look his best
when he met you.
Come, let's join the party.
You both carry on.
I'll join you in a while.
Hey...
- Hi, Jenny.
- Hi, Maggie, how's Max?
- Oh, he's great.
- Wonderful.
Would you like to dance?
I can see that you do.
Come on, we must dance.
This goes here.
This goes here...
And step back.
Back, side. Done. You've got it.
You're a natural.
- Did you give the bangle, madam?
- I can't understand what you are saying.
- Can I come to your house?
- I'm sorry?
Your house...
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
Oh, I'm so sorry, don't worry,
it'll come out.
- I am so sorry.
- Oh, no. It's completely fine.
Every damn wanker thinks he can dance.
What do you think of yourself, huh?
You country oaf.
- Look at them.
- Wait.
Look at all these brown buggers.
What do they know about art?
About finesse?
About dance?
Tango.
Swing.
Flamenco.
Can you do any of these? Huh?
Not salsa. Not Flamenco, my brother.
Do you know Desi Naach?
What is Desi Naach?
Dance up a storm
Like a bull racing down a dirt road
Dance to the beat of drums,
With pumping adrenaline
If there is anyone who can fly faster
Than an arrow, then dance
Dance like the horse in the stables
That breaks free of its reins
Till the land, make a big roti,
eat chillies and dance like this!
Come, my boy
Come, white guy
Come, my boy
Dance, dance, dance
Crazy dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance wildly
Dance as tangy as a piece of raw mango!
Dance, dance, dance
Like the bite of a scorpion
I've had enough of this nonsense!
You two. Out!
No, Jake.
I've had enough of your bullying.
Go away! Go!
Go!
The drum beats loudly, see even the sick
Get up and dance vigorously
Hear this noise, it's an explosion as
The tigers and elephants dance
See there's a festival in the heart
And buddy, we dance together
On the beat of your heels you do
A powerful rural dance
Dance so that the sweat from your brow
Shimmers and shines
Come, my boy
Come, white guy
Come, my boy
Dance, dance, dance
Dance like crazy
Dance, dance, dance
Dance wildly
Dance… Come again as I strike the tune!
Dance… if it isn't too spicy for you
This is disgusting! This is filthy!
Jenny!
The village sways, it's a crazy flow,
Pick up your feet high…
And slam them down, this is a rural
Festival, how is that, suddenly!
Dance, dance, dance
Come join me, keep dancing,
There's new life to your feet…
Keep dancing and shake up
The entire world
Dance, dance, dance
- Come on!
- We can't lose this!
Don't stop! Keep going!
- Ram! Ram! Ram!
- No.
Come on, Akhtar.
Come on, Akhtar.
Ram! Ram! Ram!
Yes!
Oh, God!
Get down now.
You are so heavy.
- I can't do this.
- Don't say that! I beg you.
My legs are about to fall off.
Carry me a little longer.
Why did you dance so much
if you were in so much pain?
I don't know.
When you looked at me like that…
I just felt like competing with you.
Are you hurt? What's happened?
Is he alright?
He's got a bad cramp.
Can you drop him at New Bazaar?
Of course.
Get in.
Would you like to come
to my place for a coffee
before I drop you home?
She is inviting you to her house
for a cup of coffee.
I would offer to drop you too,
but it's only a two-seater.
No problem, I am waiting for a friend.
Alright, bye.
The first time we met him,
he rested his hand on my shoulder.
I remember clearly.
I noticed paint in his nails.
He is definitely a painter.
Search that side, Uncle.
- Listen, have you seen him?
- No.
- Have you seen him anywhere?
- No.
- Good morning, Thomas. How are you today?
- Good morning, ma'am.
I'm very good. Thank you so much.
How about you?
I'm good, thank you.
Open the gates.
The second gate only opens
once the first is closed.
I don't understand the need
for such elaborate security measures.
Overwhelming, huh?
Uncle Scott is coming back
from London in two days.
He has been knighted by the King.
Aunt Cathy wants to throw
a grand ceremony.
Everything is checked, sir.
Have you checked every door?
Hundreds of people are working round the
clock to make sure everything is smooth.
- I don't want any hangups, officer.
- Yes, sir.
- See these lights? They were commissioned.
- What the hell are you doing here?
Robert, what are you doing?
He is with me.
He is here by my invitation.
Let him go.
Servants can't use
the main entrance, ma'am.
I'll show him the back entrance.
Robert! Robert!
He is not a servant.
He is my friend.
Let him go.
As you wish, ma'am.
That was appalling behavior.
I apologize.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
You... You're fine, right?
Okay.
Let's forget about him.
I was really looking forward to this.
I've so much that I wanted to show you.
Please. Come, sit down.
This is my room
and these are my paintings.
What do you think?
Please. Sit down.
Your dance at the party
took my breath away.
- It was amazing.
- Thank you, madam.
Jenny.
Thank you, Jenny.
It was overwhelming.
The beat pulsating through your body…
The flying feet, the flashing eyes...
The eyes.
Akhtar, your deep expressive eyes always
seem like they're searching for something.
Jenny, I can't understand
what you are saying.
O Mynah, I won't paint your wings,
Come to me
O crescent moon, I won't decorate you
With peacock feathers, come to me
I'm hungry…
Oh... I'm so sorry!
I will get you something to eat.
We should play along as we eat heartily
O wandering rabbit, come to me
Swinging off branches, playing in valleys
I should be coddled
In my mother's lap every day
- Maggie.
- Yes, ma'am?
Malli...
Brother!
Brother...
Brother.
Don't cry, Malli.
I'm here, right?
I don't want to stay here anymore.
Take me with you.
Don't shout. If the police hear us,
it won't be good for us.
Listen, I'll come back
to take you from here.
Brother.
So you are not taking me with you now?
That's not possible, Malli.
No! I want to go home.
Take me away now!
I won't be here for another moment.
Won't you listen to me?
Listen to me, Malli...
- I won't listen to you.
- Don't make noise.
If somebody hears us, we will get caught.
I don't care about all that.
Brother. Brother...
Please don't leave me here.
I want to go back to my mother.
Please take me home.
Swinging off branches, playing in valleys
All of that will be in front of your eyes
If you close them
The nightingale singing
Behind the tree will appear in your heart
Whenever you close your eyes
The trees and tender leaves will see today
From the stone enclosure around it
If you are patient enough to close
Your eyes for a moment…
The day will soon come
When you will be free
Mother…
Don't these white women bear children?
Don't they know what pain is?
They took away a child
and locked her in a cage.
Even if they cry once,
they will understand
how painful tears are.
What shall we do now?
We need to get Malli back.
We shouldn't be scared anymore.
We should surge forward.
Whoever comes in our way
should be eliminated.
Jangu, where is Lacchu?
Where is your brother?
Where is your brother?
My brother is on a mission,
and he is not going to be captured.
Especially not by traitors like you.
A dog can never hunt down a tiger.
Nobody is coming!
Seetha...
Did you receive any message from Ram?
- No, Uncle.
- Has he at least written a letter?
What is this?
It has been four years since he left.
How long should we wait for him?
Does he even remember us?
Does he remember his village, his land,
the promise he has made us?
Forget about us.
Does he at least remember you?
You will keep experiencing this pain
until I get an answer.
Tell me... where is your brother?
Banded Krait.
Even the English
don't have an antidote for its venom.
You are going to die within an hour.
It will take you a day
to untie these knots.
Live your life.
The family is organizing an event
to celebrate Scott's return.
We should execute our plan
tonight at any cost.
If we miss this opportunity,
we might not get another one.
The truck is working properly, right?
I've tested it again.
It's in good condition.
We should storm in as soon as
the celebrations start.
Jangu, you remember everything, right?
Yes, Brother.
Let's go.
Brother, when will you reach the palace?
I'll come at 8'o clock.
Uncle, ask Abbajaan to inspect
the vehicle again.
Jangu, go right now and memorize
the sound of the gates. Okay?
What happened?
Raju!
Raju, what happened?
Hey!
Banded Krait.
I need a burning piece of coal.
Jangu, get a datura root.
Raju. Raju.
You'll be fine.
East and west are engaged in a tug of war
One's a deadly weapon…
The other's a harbinger of death…
Once the veil is lifted,
Won't there be a destructive war?
Looks like the venom has taken effect.
Why are you removing the holy thread?
Don't do it.
Removing it will bring you problems.
He needs it more than me.
You guys leave.
Don't close your eyes.
I'm here with you.
You'll be fine.
You're out of danger now.
The antidote is working now.
You will be completely fine by tomorrow.
I have a little work.
I'll be back.
Raju!
If I had a choice I would stay with you.
But I have to go.
Raju...
I've hidden something from you.
I'm not Akhtar. I'm not a Muslim.
I'm Bheem. Son of the Gonds.
They took away
a little girl from our village.
We didn't know how to save her.
We didn't know whom to trust.
We didn't know what to do.
That is why I put on this disguise.
I wanted to seek your help
on many occasions.
But I didn't do so because
I didn't want to put your life in danger.
Not because I don't trust you.
We are going tonight to rescue Malli.
If we get out safely,
I will come meet you again.
If I don't make it...
I have your friendship which is more
precious than my life.
I'll die with pride.
Until next time, brother.
I have your friendship which is more
precious than my life.
He needs it more than me.
What a grand party
Aunt Catherine has put on.
- Come, let's join her.
- Let's stay with our friends.
It is a pleasure.
Lady Buxton...
- Pleasure as always.
- Thank you.
And what a magnificent event
you have organized, ma'am.
- Go, Captain!
- Take them down!
Brother.
Malli!
Malli!
Lock everything up!
Brother!
Brother!
Akhtar!
Raju, why are you
w-wearing this uniform?
I'm arresting you for rebelling
against the British Government.
Raju, are you a police officer?
Are you really a police officer?
I can't believe it.
Surrender, Akhtar.
I swear on my mother.
I didn't do anything wrong.
I told you about my problems, didn't I?
Raju, my brother,
I really didn't do anything wrong.
Just look into my eyes, my brother.
Look at me.
I haven't done anything wrong!
We came here for our sister.
She is a child.
She is a child.
I'm begging you.
Let me take my sister home.
Let me take Malli home!
I'm not going to ask you again, Akhtar.
Come with me.
Surrender!
How could you say that?
Surrender!
I'm not able to bear seeing you like this.
Raju, aren't you one of us?
You're one of us, right?
If we don't arrest him by then,
the Governor will skin us alive.
- Brother!
- Shut up, you insolent brat!
- Brother.
- Malli.
Brother.
Surrender, Bheem.
Surrender if you want Malli to stay alive.
Brother!
This is an unforeseen turn of fate
Which has culminated in this friendship
It's yet to be seen
If this will end in bloodshed
We don't know anything, sir.
We don't know anything!
They've escaped, sir.
It's as though they have vanished, sir.
Even the monkeys won't speak.
We've got the big fish, sergeant.
Just a matter of time
before we flush
the rats out of their holes. Indeed.
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.
Move out!
Owing to his outstanding performance
in the field,
and for capturing a dangerous criminal,
Mr A Rama Raju is being awarded
the rank of Special Officer.
First line point.
Second line point.

- Okay, sir.
Load.
Load.
Baba.
These wooden rifles are only
for practice, right?
We have mastered it.
Our blood is boiling
to shoot a real bullet.
When will you give us real rifles?
Do you know the value of this bullet?
It costs 15 rupees.
But an Englishman once explained
what its real value is.
To the people of Paalakurthi village,
these are the government's orders.
The villagers haven't been paying taxes
for a long time citing floods as a reason.
When a British officer came here
to investigate this,
your village head, Malla Reddy,
manhandled him.
This is a heinous crime.
And for this crime,
the criminal has been sentenced to death.
Soldier.
Do you understand how valuable
the bullet in your gun is?
It was manufactured by an Englishman.
At full pay.
It made its way here on an English ship.
By the time that single bullet has made
its way to the barrel of your gun,
it has cost the crown 6 shillings.
You don't waste it on peasant stock.
Find another way, soldier.
Yes, sir.
He said that an Indian's life
is not worth a bullet.
So how will this bullet earn its value?
When it comes out of your gun
and pierces an Englishman's heart.
When that flaming bullet soaks
in his blood.
Then... Only then will this bullet
earn its value.
The name of that value is…
Freedom.
I will give you the bullets
when I'm sure that you won't miss
even one shot.
Keep practicing until then.
- Wow!
- Hey!
How many times have I told you
not to eat with your left hand?
It will get done faster this way, Mom.
- Ram.
- Uncle.
Uncle!
- Come, Venkateswarulu.
- Brother… take this...
Seetha, why are you always here?
Don't you ever go home?
Wherever there is Ram, I'll be there.
I don't know if she will become
my daughter-in-law
but she is my daughter already.
You're building an army here.
But you've sent me into the police force.
I want to be here with you, Baba.
No. It is necessary for you to be there.
We need insider information.
Okay. What do we do now?
We will need weapons
once the training is done.
All you have is one rifle
and a few bullets.
How many people will you give them to?
Every bullet has the name
of the person it is going to kill.
Every rifle has on it the name
of the person who is going to fire it.
They will come, Venkateswarulu.
The weapons will come themselves
in search of their battle.
Turn and point. Load.
Rest the rifle properly on your shoulder.
What happened?
Down.
What is this?
Last night...
I fired your rifle, Baba.
Do you think it is a toy?
Is it a toy?
I gave it to him, Baba.
Seetha!
I gave it to him.
But Ram fired it really well.
Let me show you.
Come.
There.
Ram.
Did you shoot from those boulders?
No, Baba.
Then?
From there, Baba.
Baba, it was a mistake...
I won't do it again.
The weapon is ready, Venkateswarulu.
Our son?
Take cover.
Venkata Rama Raju... Surrender.
Otherwise, we will shoot down everyone.
This is the last warning...
Let's fight, Baba.
Let's fight!
This isn't the time to fight, Ranga.
We need to save the villagers first.
- Take everyone to the small bridge.
- Okay, Baba.
We scared him, sir.
- Venkata Rama Raju.
- Go.
Surr...
Faster! That way.
Go.
Fast.
Go.
Don't cry. We're leaving.
- Let the women and children go first.
- We have to move!
Take the children there.
Go, go!
Don't look back. Be careful.
I'll stop them from there.
On my signal,
lead everyone into the forest.
Lay low in Maavullamma valley.
These Englishmen can't reach there.
Be careful.
What about you?
Sarojini.
I am my battle.
And half of that is yours.
Rama!
Stop!
Stop.
Down!
I told you to be with your mother.
Why did you come here?
He has got good cover, sir.
He is not letting us advance.
Baba.
Down… Hide.
- Baba.
- Hide.
Aunt.
Aunt.
Rama.
Will you follow my lead?
Your aim should be precise.
Take it.

Baba, mother...
My brother, Baba!
Load!
Aim.

Shoot.
We have to change the strategy.
Back.
Fall back!
Baba.
Baba... Baba...
Baba.
Baba.
Did you see that?
Just one rifle and how all of them
have fallen back?
Just imagine...
If every person here had a weapon
then they would go back
to their country for good.
Give me your word, Ram.
Promise me that you will give
every person a weapon.
Dear Seetha, how are you?
Everything is going according to the plan.
Guns are sent
to different parts of the country
from the barracks that I'm working in.
And each time there's a consignment, they
choose an officer to transport it safely.
I'm going to get that opportunity
very soon.
The weapons are within reach.
But why is my heart heavy, Seetha?
I'm hurting the people whose freedom
I'm fighting for.
I have betrayed my closest friend.
I am nearing my goal…
But am I losing my way?
I am unable to understand.
I wish you were with me.
Yours, Ram.
One bastard did this
and all of you could do nothing.
Shame on you, Edward.
Shame on you!
I appreciate you, young man.
Your service to the crown
has been duly noted.
Thank you, sir.
I want this bastard punished
in such a way that no person
will ever rise up against the British.
Oh, I want to watch it, darling.
I want to see him bleed.
And so you shall.
Flog him publicly!
Flog him until he falls to his knees
confessing his crime of daring
to rise against us
and begs for mercy.
Sir.
The criminal who tried
to break into Governor Scott's palace
will be publicly flogged tomorrow.
The criminal who tried
to break into Governor Scott's palace
will be publicly flogged tomorrow.
The Governor has ordered
that everybody be present.
This criminal will now drop to his knees
confess to his crimes against the crown
and will beg the Governor for mercy.
If he fails to do so,
he will be punished severely.
Kneel down.
Kneel down, Bheem!
There's hardly any blood.
Hit him harder.
A few lashes and the bugger's buckled.
But he barely even cried out loud.
And where's the blood?
I was expecting a pool at his… feet.
He didn't kneel.
He didn't kneel!
Officer!
Try this one.
Use it on the pillar first, officer.
Let the wretch see how it will rip him.
Aren't you quite vicious, my dear?
This isn't going to stop, Bheem.
If you don't kneel down,
you will be killed.
Kneel and confess to your crimes.
Save your own life.
Bheema, the earth on which you were born,
the trees which give you air to breathe,
your Gond tribe which has given you
a name, are all talking to you.
Can you hear it?
O Komuram Bheem, O Komuram Bheem
You should stoke the fire in your heart
O Komuram Bheem, O Komuram Bheem
You should burn like the flaming sun
Make that bastard kneel now!
Should you fall at your oppressor's feet
Like a slave
You are no more
A child of the forest
If you bow your head to unjust rule
You could not have been born
To the forest
O Komuram Bheem, O Komuram Bheem
You should stoke the fire in your heart
Will you scream in pain
When the whip splits your skin?
Will you tremble with fear
At the mere sight of blood?
If you get scared and shed a tear…
How can you claim to be
A child of the forest?
A child of the forest...
O Komuram Bheem, O Komuram Bheem
You should stoke the fire in your heart
Your heart's blood
Which flows like a stream
Your heart's blood
Which flows like a stream
Look, it is like vermilion
On Mother Earth's forehead
It is like the sacred red paint
On Mother's feet
It shines like a smile on Mother's lips
O Komuram Bheem, O Komuram Bheem
You have given your life
As a gift to Mother Earth
O Komuram Bheem...
Reinforcements!
Raju, you've been chosen
for the delivery of the gun consignment.
Look.
The consignment will be shipped
in two days.
Promise me that you will give
every person a weapon.
Bheem is going to be hanged
the day after tomorrow.
I should change the venue from the jail
to the banks of River Yamuna.
What are you saying?
Why would you want to shift the location?
Only from there
will I be able to free Bheem.
Raju.
What is this business of freeing Bheem?
I should also free Malli
and hand her over to Bheem.
Bheem? Malli?
Are you in your senses?
It has never been clearer to me.
All this while, I was prepared
to sacrifice anything for our country.
I thought Bheem would also be
one among them.
But today I've realized...
Bheem is not merely a sacrificial lamb.
He is a volcano.
I was under the impression that guns
would bring us freedom.
But Bheem inspired everyone
with just a song.
What about you?
You've striven so much
to achieve your goal.
Will you forgo all of that
when it is within your reach?
- Will you sacrifice 15 years of hardwork...
- I will bear it for another 15 years.
But I won't sacrifice Bheem for my goal.
Father told me to give a weapon
to every person.
But Bheem's emotion turned
each person into a weapon.
I will give that emotion to the people.
Think about it, Raju.
It is very dangerous…
you could lose your life.
I will die gladly, Uncle.
I want the best hangman for the job.
I want to see his neck drawn out tight
and his eyes bulge and pop
just before his neck snaps.
Yes, sir.
But I doubt you will see fear in his eyes.
I mean…
The fear which didn't appear
while he was being whipped violently
- will not appear in the face of death.
- Yes.
And what was blatantly obvious
was your abject failure
at bringing this brute to his knees.
I'm sorry to have disappointed you, sir.
Give me one more opportunity.
Let us hang him in front of Malli
for whom he has come this far.
All of the world's fear
will then be seen in his eyes.
I see you have learned the ways
of the empire, young man.
- Keep the flag flying.
- Yes, sir.
Have him ready for hanging by 4 am
and get that wretched child here by 5.
- If I may, sir.
- Yes.
If you hang him here,
the people will make him a martyr.
We must take him outside.
To the banks of River Yamuna.
If we hang him there,
we can dispose of his corpse discreetly.
Take care. Load them carefully.
Be alert, officers.
I want no hiccups on this mission.
Yes, sir.
What are you doing?
- Help.
- Go there! Get back!
Back.
All arrangements have been made, sir.
Should be quite the spectacle.
I appreciate your effort, my boy.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Brother was with you, wasn't he?
Where is he now?
Go faster!
I said faster, damn it!
Bring me those treacherous scum alive.
Or I will skin every last one of you.
Brother.
Brother!
Malli!
I'll take my leave.
Without you, I...
Seetha.
A part of me will always be with you.
Seetha, my courage drives me.
But it is your courage
which will make me win.
Grandfather, Brother, Uncle...
I'm giving my word to the entire village.
I will give weapons to every hand
that itches to revolt.
Only after that will I come back!
I swear on Mother Godavari!
- Vande mataram!
- Vande mataram!
- Vande mataram!
- Vande mataram!
It's been months, Edward.
This jungle rat…
Bheem…
Is still proving elusive.
We are very close, sir.
Now, from the hanging point,
his only means of escape is to Agra.
And we are sealing it off.
This deadly criminal
is absconding.
We're combing it area by area.
Inch by inch, shutting it down.
I have no idea, sir!
Leave.
The only place he could be
possibly hiding now is Hathras.
Give us information about these criminals!
Keep at it.
Meanwhile,
let's pay our special guest a visit.
Shall we?
As you ordered, we are feeding him
only once a week, sir.
Just enough to keep him alive
and feel the pain.
- Like these filth?
- Oh, no, sir. Much worse than them.
He'd be so starved,
he'd be gnawing at his chains.
Exercising? With only days to live?
What do you hope to achieve?
Still chasing your impossible dream
even with death staring you in the face?
You have every right to work
but not to expect the result.
Let not the result be your motive,
nor let your attachment be to inaction.
I don't care about the result.
I will be moving towards my goal
until my last breath.
Load.
Aim.
Shoot.
Is that so?
Let's see how you move after this.
Throw him in the solitary cell.
It's been two days since we came here.
It's not good to stay in one place
for so long.
We need to leave after midnight.
Where will we go?
There is no place to hide.
Don't worry, Uncle.
We will find a way.
I'm hungry, Brother.
Oh, God. The only thing we are able
to give a hungry child is some water.
Jangu.
It is getting very difficult.
Buying even a grain of rice
seems impossible.
These dangerous criminals have escaped
and are at large.
You'll get a bounty if you give
information about them.
Wake up!
Over there. Search everywhere.
Turn this room inside out!
I want 20 guards to search the kitchen.
- Search everywhere.
- Go, go.
Take them to the traces of everyone!
They are here.
Inspector, I want you to search that room.
There are many policemen outside.
I want the names and address of everybody.
Check what's out there.
Check in that room also.
Sir, please help us.
Please help me take them to the hospital.
My people have been infected
with smallpox.
- What?
- Smallpox, sir...
Smallpox.
What's in the bag?
They have smallpox, sir.
Smallpox?
- Are you sure?
- It is smallpox, sir.
This place is infected! Everyone out!
- I beg you, sir. Please help us.
- Get away from me, you diseased rat.
No, son.
Everyone out! Out!
Ma'am, are you alright?
It's okay.
I'm fine.
You said smallpox. Who has it?
Nobody.
I just said that to help you
from the police.
My fiancee always says that
we should help other people.
Please come.
I overheard you earlier.
Children shouldn't have to know hunger.
Food gets disrespected.
We are indebted to you.
You have helped us without
knowing who we are.
Who are you?
My name is Seetha.
I'm from near Visakhapatnam.
I have come here for my fiancee.
Oh, really? Where does your fiancee live?
Delhi.
He is working as a police inspector
for the British.
- What is her name?
- Seetha.
Oh. Please don't be worried.
What my fiancee is doing
is not just a job.
It's a revolution.
Ram…
To attain your goal, you should be ready
to face any kind of obstacle.
Whatever happens… don't forget your goal.
Surround them from all sides.
Bastard! You thought you could take on us?
See the dog bleed.
Load.
Aim.
Shoot!
Let the blue sky be painted
With fiery red embers
Let my battle cries be the war sounds
That will annihilate the enemy
But then… did he get the weapons?
He was very close to getting them.
But in the process,
he had to betray his closest friend
and arrest him for the British.
He couldn't live with himself.
He was unable to understand
if what he was doing was right or wrong.
He finally decided to save his friend,
come what may.
And he did save him.
But in that process, he got caught.
I've received this letter
from the government.
He is going to be hanged in two days.
They've asked me to come collect his body.
I came for Malli.
But your fiancee came for the land.
The tribal that I am…
I couldn't understand.
I beat him with these hands.
I left my closest friend to die.
Seetha shouldn't go looking for Ram.
Ram should come to wherever Seetha is.
I will bring him to you.
You've fed us.
I'm giving you my word.
I'll bring back your Ram
even if I have to lay down my life.
This is the whole barracks.
The jail is at the end of the barracks.
Be careful, please.
Bheem. Bheem.
- Raju.
- Bheem.
- Bheem, why did you come here?
- Raju...
Forgive me, brother.
I didn't realize that you were
working towards such a great cause.
- I shouldn't have...
- Calm down.
Bheem.
Bheem.
Bheem.
Who told you?
Seetha...
Did you meet Seetha?
Yes and she opened my eyes to the truth.
I promised Seetha
that I would bring back her Ram.
Even if I have to burn down this Lanka,
I will take you to her.
Come on.
Between a tiger and a hunter
Between a head and the guillotine
Between a wildfire
And a storm
Between the sun and the cloud
Friendship...
Surround them from all sides.
Spread out.
Who left the lock?
Surround. Surround.
This is an unforeseen turn of fate
Which has culminated in this friendship
Search that way.
Where did they go?
- They went that way.
- Look everywhere!
What the hell is going on here?
Friendship between an erupting volcano
And a wild storm
Friendship between freewill and destiny
This friendship is between opposites
- What's going on, Edward?
- We arrived a bit late, sir.
- They escaped into the forest.
- They've done what?
But they are still in the barracks.
Don't follow them blindly.
Take the special forces
and nail the bastards.
Oh, and one more thing.
Don't shoot until you're close enough
to confirm a kill.
Absolutely, sir.
Call the special forces.
Fire!
Sir, Edward here.
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
- Sir?
- What the hell is going on out there?
We thought we had them surrounded, sir.
But now there are arrows
coming out of everywhere.
We are losing men, sir.
Damn them all!
I'm sending additional troops.
Do not let them escape.
Yes, sir.
More troops are on the way.
We are getting reinforcements.
Don't let them escape.
Do not let them escape.
More troops are on the way.
Edward!
I promised my father
that I will give everyone a weapon.
Turn on the searchlights.
I made a promise to Mother Godavari
that I will come back only after
I get the weapons.
Turn on those lights.
Rama, the descendant of Raghu lineage…
Is the greatest of all warriors
And his charm as the emperor is unmatched
There is no more running away.
Now it is time to make you run.
Rama, the descendant of Raghu lineage
Is the greatest of all warriors
And his charm as the emperor is unmatched
Get away from the fire!
Get back!
Good God.
Run! Run!
His bow is as powerful as Lord Shiva's
The sound of which scares
His enemies to death
Rama, the descendant of Raghu lineage
Is the greatest of all warriors
And his charm as the emperor is unmatched
Rama, the descendant of Raghu lineage
Is the greatest of all warriors
And his charm as the emperor is unmatched
Rama, the descendant of Raghu lineage
Is the greatest of all warriors
And his charm as the emperor is unmatched
Come on! Move it this way!
The skies turn dark with fear as Bheema
The lion of the Komuram clan
Leaps up to attack his enemies
Bheema, the lion of the Komuram clan...
Load.
Aim.
Shoot.
He is the one mighty dancer under
Whose graceful dancing feet
The heads of all the arrogant elephants
From the capital city Hasthina get crushed
Bheema, the lion of the Komuram clan...
Bheem.
How long do we hunt these jackals?
Let's hunt down the lion!
Load the canons.
Fire!
Bheem.
No!
Promise me that you will give
every person a weapon.
Made in an English factory,
this bullet has traveled
the seven seas in an English ship, Scott.
This is the bullet which is more valuable
than an Indian's life.
How can you throw it away?
Return it to him, Bheem.
Let him keep it in his heart.
Load!
No! No!
Aim!
Shoot!
You've achieved it.
Bheem…
You've taken me closer to my ambition.
You've given me this attire
that will inspire me to fight.
What can I offer you in return?
Teach me, brother.
Fly that flag
To which we've given our lives
There is an iron man
In every lane and home
Fly that flag
To which we've given our lives
There is an iron man
In every lane and home

It's a brand new morning
And we have broken all our shackles
Flames burst in everybody's minds now
Does anyone have the guts
To challenge us now?
Iron, flame, ball of fire, spear...
Awake! Son! Speak! Embers!

These embers are revolution
The Kittur embers
Swift as an arrow
The Tirunelveli embers
Billow the flag

There is an iron man
In every lane and home
Mother!
Malli!
WATER - JUNGLE - LAND
Once clasped, these hands won't let go
The brave men have worn
The turban of sacrifice
Whenever the bugle of victory sounds
The heart and mind will dance and sway
The darkness has been dispelled,
Have faith in yourself
Being together gives the heart reassurance
Come! King! Play! Win!
Awake! Flames! High! Embers!
Strong are these embers
The Punjabi embers
These tireless embers
The Tanguturi embers
Pure embers
The Palasi embers
They are the winning blow
The brave Maratha embers
We bow down before no one
Who can challenge us?
Everywhere the drums of triumph play
Sing, my friend
In a way that the earth shakes
Our friends have come, so play the drums
Together we sing and dance
And the world sways with us
-You've just tasted it
-Now play the big drums
-The taste of victory
-So move your feet to the beat!
The proud names of these people
Shine in the stars
Their names are written in our hearts
Fly that flag
To which we've given our lives
There is an iron man
In every lane and home
Fly that flag
To which we've given our lives
There is an iron man
In every lane and home
