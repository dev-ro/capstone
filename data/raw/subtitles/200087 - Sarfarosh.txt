How can the minister answer your
questions? One at a time.
Yes, your question.
How did the tribals get such
sophisticated arms?
We're investigating that.
But l assure you...
l'm not going to spare the
people responsible.
lnnocents were slaughtered.
What guarantees it won't
happen again?
l'm concerned too.
But l assure you it
won't happen again.
The Mumbai Police Crime Branch
is investigating this case.
A special team will
be investigating.
Greetings, sir! - Greetings!
You're late, Major Beg.
l've good news.
The papers in Hindustan are
full of news of our success.
Who did all this?
There's someone called Veeran.
And what was his grouse? - None.
We cooked up some.
That's our mandate.
Find the disgruntled elements
and help them.
Give them guns and money.
Let them get used to it.
This is war.
And we've to win this war.
By the way,
where is this Chandrapur?
Here's Bombay.
And Chandrapur is here
on the border of...
...Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.
Greetings, sir.
How come so early?
Actually,
you shouldn't be staying here.
What?
The case has been transferred
to Mumbai.
So what? For a couple of days...
They'll shout themselves hoarse
and then be quiet.
Not this time.
Veeran's attack has
raised a furore.
So what am l to do?
Did l do anything?
People from the Crime Branch
in Mumbai are here.
They might come here too.
You better slip away.
These special officer
are unpredictable...
lf they get their hands on you
l won't be able to do a thing.
How far is the police station?
- Nearby. He'll escort you.
Hey go with sir.
Go to the police station and
get the case papers. - Ok.
So you know inspector
Salim in Mumbai?
Yes, sir.
He's all praise for you...
...and you're so quiet.
Bala Thakur is the man behind
everything that happens here.
Bal Thakur? Who is that?
- The don in these parts.
There are so many complaints
against him.
The police don't arrest him?
- He has been hauled up...
So many times. But he gets away
every time with his contacts.
ln the last three years or so,
he has bought two wine shops...
...a huge hotel in Chandrapur
and lot of land.
lnterrogate him,
and you'll know the whole game.
Where does he live? - Nearby.
Crime Branch, Mumbai.
Where is Bala Thakur?
Gone out. - Out?
Wait...
No one searches Thakur
sir's house.
Don't. You'll regret it.
Don't do this! You'll regret
it when the sir comes back!
Your sir isn't coming back,
tell him to report to ACP Rathod...
...or he's dead.
C'mon, Kadam! - Yes, sir.
Make sure he understands.
Make sure you tell your boss.
Tell him to get to Mumbai.
The only way to save his neck...
...is to report to ACP Rathod.
lf we find him, he's dead!
l told you not to shout here!
Get down. - He's becoming naughty.
Let's go, Papa!
Ajay, listen... - Yes, Uncle?
Would you like to attend
a ghazal concert?
Gulfam Hasan is performing.
- Great! How can l refuse?
When is it?
- At six. Hurry.
Thank you.
One minute.
Daddy, l'm going to Gulfam
Hasan's concert.
Mummy, here's your bread.
l'm going out.
Where to? - l'll have dinner later.
Our guest this evening...
...is someone who is
world renowned...
...and this famous singer
is Gulfam Hasan.
He's our guest this evening
and also our host.
He's our guest as
well as our host.
He belongs as much to Pakistan as
much as he belongs to lndia.
He spent his childhood here
and he grew up there.
His ghazals are written there,
but his music belongs here.
l present the honourable
Gulfam Hasan.
Thank you.
l belong as much to Pakistan
as l belong to Hindustan.
My ties to both the lands are
emotional and sentimental...
...which transcends
all relationships.
ln the poetic language of
ghazal it's called love.
Lost is all awareness!
Lost is all reasoning!
Obsession with love
turns man inhuman!
"The conscious will never know
what a trance really is..."
"Do fall in love to know
what life really is..."
"The conscious will never know
what a trance really is..."
"Our eyes had only to meet for
our worlds to light up."
"Only then did l realise
the true magic of love."
"Do fall in love to know
what life really is."
"The cascading locks unveiled
the blossoming seasons."
"The lowered gaze told me what
intoxication really is."
"Do fall in love to know
what life really is."
"My lips could never speak out
the thoughts in my heart."
"She could never really know
what my silence meant."
"Do fall in love to know
what life really is..."
You know me, don't you?
No.
l'm Ajay Singh.
So?
l want to tell you something.
- Go on.
Here? - Why not here?
Can we go somewhere else?
- Why? Just say it here.
Ok. We know each other...
No! l mean we don't know
each other so well.
So l wanted to see you. - Bus...
Bus? - My bus is here.
They've been threatening.
They've phoned twice already.
Listen to me!
- How much more do l listen?
l'm not letting you go out!
They are terrorists!
Must you stand witness
against them?
Why not? My friends were killed.
My colleagues are deposing too.
But they didn't get threats!
Don't worry,
they're going together.
Let's go, Papa. lt's time for
the court. - Ok, let's go.
Off you go to granny.
Let's go together. - C'mon.
Do whatever you want,
no one ever listens to me!
l'm going to college.
l want to go with grandpa!
Stop! Please!
Stop!
Get out!
You come to the police
station everyday...
...harass and drives me crazy!
Hey old man, who is he?
- He's my nephew.
lf l see him here ever again,
l'll fix him!
Am l the one who took
your father away?
You want all my men to start
looking for your father?
You'll be told when he's found.
Now get lost!
Enough...
How long are we to go
on living like this?
We're doing whatever we can.
Have patience. Patience.
A car...
What happened to you?
What have you done to him?
The same that the police do to us.
We told him not to depose.
Then why did he have to?
Now show him to the police.
We treat people who
help the police...
...the same way the police
treat our people.
Staring at me, are you? Staring?
You'll end up just
like your father.
Go and tell everyone!
This is what happens to those
who depose against us.
C'mon!
You must realise there's
nothing left here.
Come with me to Mumbai.
Stop teasing me.
Teasing you? - What else is this?
You're the one who does that...
like the other day...
...when he came to see you.
- l was just pulling his leg.
l never thought he wouldn't
come back.
Tell me. Why isn't he coming?
- No idea. l haven't seen him...
...and their house is empty.
No one lives there now.
They say,
Gulfam has his own charm!
Come on.
Your attention please.
Mr. Ajay Singh, you're requested
to come backstage.
Mr. Ajay Singh from Delhi,
please come backstage.
Your brother wants to hurry up.
Hurry up. Let's get out
before the traffic jam.
Tell him l'm coming.
Mr. Ajay Singh...
Mr. Ajay Singh from Delhi...
Please come backstage.
Someone is waiting for you.
Mr. Ajay Singh...
Ajay!
You haven't changed!
But you have, since we last met
at the bus stop in Delhi.
lt's been so many years...
Your brother is getting angy.
- Tell him l'm coming.
We meet aRer so long...
and now there's no time.
Come...
let's talk on the way... - Alright.
Tell me, how come you're here?
But before all that...
You disappeared from Delhi!
l kept looking for you.
First tell me,
how come you're here?
Won't you say something?
- Not unless l'm given a chance.
Sorry... so how come you're here?
- l live here.
Where? - ln Colaba.
Where in Colaba?
- Do you know Rajari?
Raiasthan HandicraRs Emporium.
The one behind Tai hotel.
lt's ours. - Ok.
l'm in a hurry. Don't mind.
We're hosting a pam tomorrow.
You must come.
l'll give you my phone number.
Show me your hand.
You must call me. Don't forget.
You won't so l'll drop
the invitation.
Rajari, handicrafts emporium,
behind Taj hotel. Right?
What took you so long? Who was he?
A friend from Delhi.
ls this handmade?
- Of course, it is.
How much does it cost? - Rs.850.
What can l do for you?
l'd like to meet the owner.
- Yes? What can l do for you?
l'd like to see Mr. Ajay Singh.
This way, please.
Anita, she wants to meet the boss.
Mr. Ajay Singh.
So you want to meet the boss?
Yes. - Why?
Doesn't he see visitors?
Not all visitors. Do you know him?
Of course, all the way from Delhi.
Don't mind, we're good friends.
Here comes the boss.
Mr. Ajay Singh,
sir, she wants to see you.
The owner of this shop.
- Don't pull my leg.
Seema, this is my sister-in-law.
Meet Seema.
We were in college together.
l know.
And this is the owner.
He's my uncle.
l came here to invite you...
l mean, everyone is invited.
We're throwing a small pam.
l'd like it if you come.
See you. - Have a cup of tea.
Excuse me. l'm in a hurry.
Don't mind. Next time?
Namaste. - Namaste.
Do come.
Yesterday's verse has arrived
in human form.
Politics is so ridiculous.
When we were born,
the whole county was ours.
And suddenly we see there's
a Pakistan and a Hindustan.
You should have remained a child.
How could l with such beautiful
women around?
Come, sit.
There's something l
don't understand.
A ghazal concert... Gulfam Hasan...
this pam... and you?
Let me start from the beginning.
You know how things were in Delhi.
My brother's music business
began to do well.
He bought a recording studio
in Mumbai and we came over.
Don't mind,
Gulfam sings exclusively for us!
Brother Roshan looks after the
business and l get bored.
Brother... meet him.
This is Mr. Ajay Singh.
Hello. - Hello.
We used to be in college together.
- Very good.
Are you visiting Mumbai? - No.
l live here.
Great.
You should call him home sometime.
Roshan, a call for you.
Seema, just look after him.
Enjoy yourself.
Don't leave without eating.
Yes, your honour!
The music companies want ghazals
that sound like disco.
l'm a great Gulfam fan.
- l'll introduce you.
And where do you find good
poets these days?
There is a dearth of
meaningful poetry.
lf good poetry isn't written,
how will we sing them?
Gulfam sir, meet my guest.
Mr. Ajay Singh.
lf he's your guest,
then it's my honour!
You're always on stage.
No, l dwell in the hearts
of my admirers.
Any doubts, Mr. Ajay?
lf there are any,
let me put it to rest.
"When eyes meet,
hearts do not..."
"...the culmination cannot
precede the prelude."
That's a very old ghazal.
And you're quite young.
Where did you hear it?
- Not me, my uncle...
...heard it in the court of
the Maharaja of Chitpur.
Oh yes!
lt was your first concert.
My uncle recorded all the ghazals.
What a find! But where can
l find the recording?
lt's with me.
l keep listening to it.
Ustad lmtiyaz Ali Khan
introduced you.
After his recital, he said...
"Listen to this boy sing,
and you'll forget me."
l still try to sing with
the same honesty.
But, it's difficult.
But if not sing, l could hear
it and relive those moments.
lf you can give me a copy,
l'll be obliged for life.
No obligations.
You'll surely have what is yours.
Really!
Let's celebrate!
Thakur.
What is it?
How about a smile?
Cut it out, Sultan.
l'm in no mood!
That's a perfume for women.
Perfume for women. - So what?
Who is that?
How are you Sultan?
- Thakur? Come... sit...
Boss, Rajan is waiting!
Yes, we will...
Everything all right?
- l got screwed!
And you're taking it easy?
- What's up?
The cops came home
and threatened me.
What are you talking.
l'm to surrender to ACP
Rathod or get killed.
What?
Who's this ACP Rathod?
He's the head of the
crime branch here...
...and you don't even know!
Thakur, now that you're here...
...relax for a couple of days.
l'll take care things.
Hey Mala, take care of him.
Give him a drink. Get it?
l'll be back! Let's go, Shiva.
What would you like?
lt's impossible to find an
AK 47 in all of Mumbai.
No.
l'm giving it to you because
l'm a friend.
lt's a great piece.
Here, dump it in a gutter...
...pick it up after a year,
it'll still be as good.
No maintenance issues.
100,OOO to a piece.
Did you get cash?
Any hurry? - Not at all.
Give it to him.
Greetings!
Don't touch the car.
- l'm cleaning the car...
...not your pockets!
- You aren't getting paid.
Who's looking for money?
l'll take it from Mr. Rajan.
l told you not to touch it.
You hit me!
You're new! You don't know me!
Your boss has known me for years!
You don't know me
Greetings boss!
Boss, your man calls me a thief!
l'm Fatka! Remember me, boss?
He calls me a thief!
- Don't talk too much.
The chauffeur calls me a thief!
All he gets is a salary of 1000.
l spend 2000 a month on booze!
Why is Thakur here?
Some cop named ACP Rathod
has threatened him.
Surrender, or get killed.
l asked Thakur to stay put
for a couple of days.
l asked Shiva to find out
who this Rathod is.
He's still working on the
Chandrapur report.
l hate this drudgey.
lf l loved writing would
l've joined the police?
Give it to me.
Mr. Rathod hates mistakes.
Just fill up the pages.
That kid won't be able to
make head or tail of it.
He's not a kid. He's big dad!
Here comes your dad. ACP Rathod!
The robbery case is due in
court the day after. - Ok.
l want to discuss the brothel
case with you.
Later.
Sir, we found the
drug case corporater.
Where is he? - ln there.
Stop staring at me.
Call up Rathod.
Find out when he's coming.
l haven't got all day!
l'm fasting today!
So he's the one?
When you sent for me, l knew.
lt must be a new officer.
l don't think they have
introduced me properly.
l'm the local corporater
Ganpat Rao.
The biggest of officers
come to my doorstep.
No one confronts me.
Keep him in remand for 3 days...
...and don't record the arrest.
- Yes, sir.
Sir is here!
The report will be ready in 5
minutes. - Leave that. Come in.
Get me a glass of water.
Send for inspector Salim.
The information was correct.
AK47s were used.
A leader instigated the tribals...
...his name is Veeran.
And this is Bala Thakur.
He supplied the guns.
He got news of our arrival
and escaped.
We've ordered him to surrender.
Did you investigate
the tribal areas?
How do we face AK47s with
service revolvers?
The tribals aren't our problem,
Thakur is.
When's my meeting with the DCP?
- Eleven O'clock!
Where's lnspector Salim?
- On the beat!
l told your boss not to send you
here. Then why are you here?
l'm just doing what
my boss told me to.
Should l leave? - Leave the cash.
ls it the full amount? - Yes.
Close the door behind you.
Put the money away.
Who are you?
- Crime Branch, Mumbai.
Go inside.
Just a minute!
Handover the packet.
Check if they're the same notes.
They're the same, sir.
Who is the deputy commissioner
you report to?
Why call him up?
Let's settle this mutually.
Where is Bala Thakur?
- Who is Bala Thakur?
ln Mumbai. - Where in Mumbai?
His contact in Mumbai is Sultan...
He's gone to meet him.
But l don't know anything
about Sultan!
l'm telling the truth!
l've told you everythig l knew!
Please, sir!
Let's end the matter here!
File a report against him
in his police station.
And a copy of it should be at...
...the DCP's table by
tomorrow morning.
Sir... sir... - Let's go!
Wow! Smells great!
Fatka, pay me up.
- Sure. l'm in a good mood.
Poor girl. lt was her first deal.
Go on, now. - Give me the shirt.
See you!
- Hey Fatka, pay me! - Later.
- All you want is money... money...
- Goddamn bum! Freeloader!
Fool! Go on!
Twinkle twinkle little stars!
Who will come into my arms?
Hey!
lnspector Salim! Greeting sir!
My dreams are crushed...
and so is my shirt.
l don't see you around these days.
Not at all, sir.
l called you up. - What for?
That Raian whom you externed.
- What about him?
He keeps doing the rounds here.
- When did you see him?
Many times, even today. - Where?
ln Sangam bar.
You'll find him there.
No, thanks.
This time, it's from me to you.
When you meet Rajan's chauffeur,
give him a whack.
He insulted me.
Did you really see Rajan?
l swear it.
Twinkle twinkle little stars!
Had you come on time, we could've
picked him up from the bar.
Overtake that car.
The police are behind us.
Take the first left.
l don't want hassles.
They're turning left.
- Head straight on.
Good. They went past us.
Take a left from here.
Take a left!
Come to this side.
Take a right.
Easy now.
Get them.
Rajan... Rajan...
Take care of him.
Sultan! Stop!
Or l'm going to shoot!
Are you so hungry for medals
that you take such risks?
l had the information.
What could l've done?
Handled things more cautiously.
There was no time.
So you take three constables
and a service revolver...
...and chase Rajan and Sultan?
- l had news only of Rajan.
l didn't know Sultan would
be there with him.
Besides l had arrested
Rajan earlier.
He used to carry a county-made
revolver.
l had no idea he would
have an AK47.
lf you're so desperate to die,
then kill yourself!
You've got 3 constables killed!
Who's responsible?
Stay outside.
l'll send for you later.
Salim won't work on
this case anymore.
Sir, please.
l'll explain it to him.
Explain what?
The whole department feels
that he let Sultan off...
...because he's a Muslim himself.
Salim isn't such an officer.
As it is, l've enough pressures.
l can't take chances.
The tribals are armed.
There's no news of Thakur and
now even Sultan has AK47s.
This is just what l feared!
How many more Sultans
are going around...
...this city toting AK47s?
Call Salim.
Sorry, Salim.
l guess l was excited.
Please let Mr. Rathod
have the case papers.
From tomorrow,
you can take care of the godowns.
l know why you're taking
me off this case, sir.
Salim was my training officer.
l know him. He's a good officer.
He has an extensive network
of informers.
l need Salim on this case.
Officially,
Salim is off this case.
l understand. Thank you, Sir.
The papers aren't ready.
You'll get the file next week.
l don't want the file.
l want you to work with
me on this case.
l know everyone's wants.
Salim, l trained under you.
l learnt so much from you.
Don't ever say you trained
under me, sir!
l never trained anyone
to suspect someone...
...just because he doesn't
belong to your religion.
You must have learnt
that somewhere else.
You pass one exam... became my
superior and rule over me.
Now you think you can ill-treat
me because l'm a Muslim?
Now l know! ln this county it's
a crime to be a poor man!
And a bigger crime
to be one like me!
Go away, sir.
l don't want to work with you.
Sultan's mother?
Are you sure? - Yes.
How old is she? - 60 or 65.
She lives alone. She's a widow.
Sultan is her only son.
Are you Sultan's mother?
Who are you? - Police.
Speak up. ls Sultan your son?
Yes. - Where is he?
He doesn't live here.
- Where does he live?
l don't know.
You better say it or
we've our ways.
Sultan was 21 when he committed
his first murder.
l threw him out of the house.
lt's been years...
...l haven't seen him since.
l didn't look for him...
...and he hasn't come to see me.
Forgive me.
Sometimes, one has to be harsh.
Just a minute...
Please let me have your name
and your telephone number.
lf l get any news of Sultan,
l'll let you know immediately.
Here's my card.
Thank you.
lt's here.
What is it? - Veeran is here.
Why did you bring him here?
- They held a gun at my head.
They wanted to see you right away.
Sultan! lt's Veeran!
Welcome, Brother.
You vanished after the
first delivery.
l told you we need more arms.
- The cops came home.
So l came here.
This is Sultan. - Welcome Veeran.
What does it cost? How much?
70,OOO.
Without the bullets,
what's it worth?
Nothing! lt's useless.
The stuff is worth 12,OOO, OOO.
Here's the valuation certificate.
Check it out.
Here's my list. l want 20 AK47s.
The rest in ammunition.
You'll get it?
When?
ln two weeks...
Not earlier?
Sultan will ty his best.
Greetings! - Greetings!
ls my work done?
- l've drawn up your horoscope.
Greetings. - Greetings.
So Veeran sends cash? - Yes.
And a new list.
But he wants less guns
and more ammunition.
Anyone who gets a gun will want
bullets... at any cost.
But Veeran is a dangerous man.
And he wants it fast.
- He will have it.
Pay the priest,
and you'll be blessed.
Here, eat some offerings.
Thakur, here's your horoscope.
Keep it at the feet of
the deity you worship.
l'm not a big astrologer.
But your Saturn is malefic.
- That l know.
But there must be a remedy.
- Stay clear of metals.
Saturn must be appeased.
Chant the mantra for a fortnight.
lf you survive this one,
you'll live to be a hundred.
l thought you had forgotten me!
- How could l?
Here you're. The recording
of your first concert.
May l keep it? - Yes.
- You have done me a great favor.
This ghazal is from the time when
l used to sing for myself.
Nowadays, l sing for others.
This is a priceless gift.
You can name your price.
A price for something priceless?
l'd rather you remember
me some times for it.
How can l ever forget you?
But you must accept
a gift from me.
Gift?
Gulfam's friendship.
Hi Ajay! - Hi!
l was here to meet Gulfam and
give him the cassette.
Don't mind,
l introduced you to Gulfam.
Thank you. Ok, see you.
Where are you going? - Nowhere.
Why?
l've to discuss something
important with you.
ls it? Tell me.
Here? Let's go elsewhere. Get in.
So what's so important?
What l wanted to say...
l mean... you know l don't
get sleep nowadays.
Must be the mosquitoes.
You could get malaria.
Use a repellent.
l didn't meant that.
What l wanted to say...
Do you know what it means when
l say my heart is racing?
High BP. A heart ailment. Could
lead to heart failure.
Avoid fats and iog daily.
l didn't mean that.
What l wanted to say...
You know, this strange churning
in the stomach?
An upset stomach.
Eat a ripe banana with yogurt.
That'll fix it. - Ajay,
don't mind. lt's so pleasant...
...and all you think
of are diseases!
You're a fan Gulfam.
Don't you recite poetry?
Sure. Want to hear? - Go on.
"Neither medicines can cure,
nor prayers can heal it..."
"Lord, let no one suffer
the pangs of love."
"Someone tell this fellow..."
"...not to be scared of love?"
"Someone tell this fellow not
to be scared of love?"
"The sweet pangs of love
are always a pleasure."
"The further he runs...
the nearer l go... l go."
"Someone tell this fellow not
to be scared of love?"
"He's blind to beauty and the
heat of youthful love."
"Majnu to Romeo were ruined
for the cause of love."
"l'm crazy about him.
lf he's good, l'm even better."
"Being a man, he's crazily shy...
l wonder why... l wonder why..."
"Someone tell this fellow not
to be scared of love?"
"l know for a fact that
this is just an act."
"He hides his tremulous heart
as it beats so fast."
"My heart's not a open resort that
you can walk in and out."
"When alone he sighs with love but
still pretends not to love."
"Never reveals the truth but
keeps lying... lying..."
"Someone tell this fellow not
to be scared of love."
"The sweet pangs of love
are always a pleasure."
"The further he runs...
the nearer l go... l go."
"Someone tell this fellow not
to be scared of love."
ln spring flowers blossom,
in the heart so does love.
Words can't express true love,
don't my eyes tell you so?
"Come... all are welcome..."
"...don't go astray..."
"Come...
be one of us, don't make a fuss."
"Come... all are welcome..."
What is it? - Scoot!
Do you know ACP Rathod? - No.
ls he new here? - Yes.
He's with the Crime Branch.
l want a full report on him.
Goodness! - Looks fine.
No. lt isn't right.
- Don't mind, you look like a hero.
How about this one?
This? The other one was better.
This is rubbish.
You don't have a sense of style.
These boring clothes you wear...
Ajay, where are we going?
l don't get this...
Give me your cell phone.
l'm Nailk here, Shiv.
From fountain.
Rathod here.
Get to Fountain with a few men.
Mocambo cafe...
near the parking lot... hurry.
Ajay, don't mind...
who is this ACP Rathod? - l am.
ACP?
- Assistant Commissioner of Police.
And l'm the Queen of Patiala.
l'm not joking. - Neither am l.
You're the ACP. l'm the queen!
And that fellow is tailing us!
Why is he tailing us?
l'll ask him right away.
Hey mister,
why are you tailing us?
Why are you arresting me?
What have l done?
Take him away. Put him in remand.
What have l done?
Step back!
Who are you?
Tell me. Who are you?
Can't you safely escort one man?
You know how important
he's for the case!
But sir... - Shut up!
Who was on traffic duty? - Me, sir.
Did you see the man on the
motorbike? - No, sir. - Why?
l was booking a car.
l know what you were booking!
Weren't you on the beat?
- Yes, sir.
l had gone around the corner
for a minute. - A minute!
Look what happened in a minute!
You know what can happen
to you in a minute?
You can be transferred.
To a place where there are
no corners to turn into.
ls Salim back from sick leave?
- No, sir.
Get ten copies of this photo.
- Ok, sir.
How many?
- Ten, sir. - lmmediately!
We'll meet at Apsara bar
at eight tonight.
Salim, how are you? - Fine, sir.
Here's the file.
So you won't work on this case?
- No, sir.
ls that a final decision?
- Who am l to decide?
You higher-ups are the
ones who decide.
l miss a target, and the whole
department starts gossiping.
And l'm shunted off the case.
Why? Because l'm a Muslim.
Today, a man dies in your custody
and no one says a word.
Why? Because you're a Hindu.
You're an lPS officer.
Maybe your father
is some big shot?
lPS officer.
A big shot for a father.
Do you know my father?
That is my father.
Ask him how l became an lPS.
He won't be able to tell you.
He hasn't spoken in years.
And that is my sister-in-law.
She's a widow.
Ask her how she became a widow.
Those who killed my brother,
did this to my father...
...l don't even know who they are.
l don't want your sympathy
but hear me out.
l broke my back working for
the police services exams.
l was selected for the
administrative services.
l could've become a bureaucrat
and lived a comfortable life.
But l chose the police service.
Why? Because in every criminal
l see those men.
l want to see every criminal
groveling before the law.
But this isn't a personal grouse.
This concerns my county.
ls it not my county? - Maybe not?
Maybe that's why you're shirking
your responsibility?
For me, this county is family.
And l don't need a Salim to
help me save my family.
Sir, the photos.
- Everyone has one?
Anyone knows this bar? - No, sir.
Comb all the bars in this area.
We must find this girl.
Split up.
What will you do if you find her?
Arrest her? - No.
One man stays behind.
The other reports to me.
You'll find me in Apsara bar.
"This nubile beauty captivates
the young and old alike."
"Who knows what tomorrow holds!
Enjoy your life today!"
"This nubile beauty captivates
the young and old alike."
"Who knows what tomorrow holds!
Enjoy your life today!"
"This nubile beauty captivates
the young and old alike."
Hello, sir.
Know her? - She doesn't work here.
Ask your boss.
Your men are looking
for this girl.
"My young heart beats for all as
old and young spirits soar."
"We know not what tomorrow holds
so live your life to the hilt."
"This nubile beauty captivates
the young and old alike."
Who are you looking for?
Know this one?
Who are you really looking for?
Bala Thakur of Chandrapur.
"The night is still young and
every heart is in a trance."
"lntoxicating is the ambience So
live your life to the hilt."
"Life's fun for those who seek
life's pleasures to the hilt."
"My young heart beats for all as
old and young spirits soar."
"We know not what tomorrow holds."
"So live your life to the hilt."
"My young heart beats for all..."
Had your dinner? - No.
Go to Kheda Naka.
You'll get the dinner you seek.
Tonight at Kheda Naka.
These girls keep changing jobs.
She's nowhere in this area.
Let's try Bombay Central.
- Ok, sir.
You won't find anything there.
What are you doing here?
ls there a curfew here?
You're looking for her,
aren't you?
But what's the use finding her?
You want Thakur, don't you?
You'll find him at Kheda Naka.
Go pick him up.
Wait! Listen to me.
l've heard enough.
l've given you Thakur.
Go save your county, your family.
l'm not needed!
l need you! l need ten Salims
to save this family!
Not ten,
you'll find thousands of Salims.
Only if you can trust them!
Listen to me, sir!
Don't ever tell any Salim that
this county isn't his!
l won't.
Never.
lf the information is bogus
we'll be here all night.
lt's genuine. He'll come!
A man on a bike.
Looks like the killer!
Relax! Stay put.
He's the sniffer. Let him pass.
lt's Sultan. - l know.
l won't spare Sultan tonight.
That's Patil!
The one we'd threatened.
So Thakur... sit...
No one shoots at Thakur.
l want him alive.
Got it.
Ok, sir.
Careful!
We won't get such a chance again.
Your stuff is here.
lt will be delivered to Veeran.
How was the girl Mala?
l left so many messages but
you refuse to respond.
Who are you?
Can't you guess?
ACP Rathod!
Get up!
Quick!
Get the car! Come here!
Are you all right, sir?
See if Thakur's alive!
Do they want to start a war here?
Our enemies are fortunate.
They need not send their
armies to fight us.
Sending arms is enough!
How is Rathod?
How irresponsible!
You should have taken him
to the nearest hospital.
Anything could've happened.
He has lost so much blood.
You cannot go inside.
Bring it here!
Speak up, Mirchi.
Everything has gone wrong.
What?
The entire consignment of
arms has been seized.
My men aren't to be blamed.
Sultan's men were at fault.
lt's not a mere fault.
lt's a major failing.
Let it be!
They too have lost a lot of money.
Sure, but do you think the
police will let things be?
Do you think they'll not
follow up on the case?
lf you don't want the police
at your doorstep...
...then you'll have
to do something.
You always have to pay
for your mistakes.
Now look at what this
creature has done.
Disturbed my privacy and trampled
on my musical antiques.
Does it deserve to be spared?
Do you know how it
will be punished?
Move on...
Take that helmet off!
License?
Shut the shop!
Come out!
Look at the time! Shut the shop!
We should keep out of
Bombay for a few days
How did ACP Rathod reach Kheda
Naka? l smell a rat!
l don't have the Don's brain
but l know one thing.
The old racket was better...
selling heroin.
There was no choice!
Mirchi was adamant.
lf we wanted drugs,
we'd to pick up the guns.
What could we do?
We had to accept.
Hello Veeran! We...
When will you deliver?
You know what happened!
The consignment was seized.
Thakur got killed but
you'll get the guns.
But Veeran, we need some time.
Time? Come here!
See them? Know who they're?
Reserve Police.
They are surrounding us!
My men don't have bullets
to fight back!
Tell your bosses even if one of
my men die, l'll destroy them.
l'll deliver as soon as l can.
l give you my word.
Your word? Think it over.
lf you don't keep your word,
l'll rip out your tongue.
Then you can give your life
but never your word.
Don't worry.
l'll take care of things here.
You'll be taken across the border
and well looked after.
Veeran must get his arms.
He will get it!
Don't worry we'll get you back
once things cool down.
Thank you...
Goodbye...
News of Sultan's escape to
Pakistan must reach the police.
Then things will cool down.
And for now,
forget all your other businesses.
Find out how all this happened.
Thakur messed things up.
This time, l'll take delivery.
Know why you were spared?
Because you aren't human.
l never spare humans
for their mistakes.
Years ago humans here
made a major mistake.
Political pimps drew a line across
our land partitioning us.
Donkeys on both sides
of the line...
...then got the freedom to elect...
...the donkeys that would
rule over them.
The results are evident today.
We were doomed.
Once this beautiful palace
was like a pre bride.
Now it lies neglected like
an abandoned widow.
l'll not accept this
cruel joke silently.
Sire!
Sultan has been sent
to the other side!
Good!
Have you convinced Haji?
Yes. But he has a problem.
Who will compensate his loss?
That's not our problem.
He's in business!
He has made enough profits
to take a few losses.
However l'll request the General
across the border...
...to compensate him!
Compensate? He'd promised us a
hundred flashpoints in lndia.
Last news was the bus massacre...
no good news after that!
l had great hopes of Gulfam Hasan
but that fool mohajir...
...is lost in the warmth
of lndian hospitality!
Welcome Baig! You'll leave
for lndia immediately!
Don't panic.
You're going on an official visit.
lndia has offered to host an
lndo-Pak meet of poets.
They don't want war which
is fine with us...
As long as they've men like
Mirchi and Veeran...
...what's the need to
fight an actual war?
You're right, sir.
When you meet Gulfam remind
him of his promise to us...
...if he can't fan the
flames of our...
...proxy war he should come back.
He can keep singing with the
useless migrants from lndia.
We've erected check posts
all over the city.
We've clamped down
on all night-life.
Fine! But why is there no
progress in the case?
Where is the motorcycle man?
And what news of Sultan?
Sultan's escaped to Pakistan.
He was their main agent
here in Bombay.
Sultan and the motorbike man
both lead to a dead end.
But they must have others
in Bombay. Find a link!
Come in! Salim, this is Seema.
This is lnspector Salim.
l'll take leave, sir.
Find that motorcycle man.
My entire network is hunting
for that man.
We must find him. - Yes.
Stop! Someone may come!
That's why l'm shutting the door...
...l want the whole story now.
Every time you start narrating
someone barges in...
...and the story is
left incomplete.
Alright. Open the door. l'll
tell you the whole story.
Promise? - Promise.
Tell me! - What's this?
My dress...
...it'll help brighten your day.
lsn't it lovely?
Yes, but it's a bit short!
Don't mind, you're old-fashioned.
just get on with the story.
Well, we reached the eatery...
Yes! Yes! l know all that! You
waited for Thakur and Sultan.
They walked in and you asked
Thakur Recognise me?
Then Thakur ran... you chased.
They fired and you fired back.
We know all that.
What happened after that?
After that l grabbed Thakur...
Chintu has come! - Chintu?
Chintu... - Uncle!
Chintu has come!
Who else is with you?
- Mummy, granny and me.
God! Then l must be off!
You must meet my mother.
Not today. - Why not?
Since you didn't like my dress
will she like it? Problem!
The girl from Delhi!
How are you, son?
l'm fine!
They should take off this plaster.
Let the doctors decide.
This is Seema.
The girl from Delhi? - Yes.
Come here.
Where do you live in Delhi?
Punjabi Baug. Now l live here.
Come home sometime.
She's been looking
forward to that.
Sure!
She's a shy girl.
No! She's not shy! She was
sitting on uncle's lap.
Liar! She was next to me.
Rathod's still recovering.
His leg is in a plaster cast.
He's on the first floor,
room no.9. Things are as planned.
ls this room no.9?
ls Mr. Rathod asleep?
Mr. Rathod, l'm a friend and
l respect officers like you.
You should know some facts and
not take foolish risks.
You're lucky the bullet
hit your arm...
...or it could've even been fatal.
The case has now reached
its nadir with...
...the fugitives have fled
across the border.
And the police are harassing
the innocents here.
We're losing out on business.
How long can we take it?
We're incurring huge losses.
A couple of millions is
no big deal for us...
...you'll get it anytime.
These are bad times.
Hitmen will kill for a pittance!
What do l tell them?
Mr Rathod,!
This behaviour is unacceptable.
Your leg is in plaster and
the wound is yet to heal.
Why take such risks when l've
still to cut the plaster?
When will you cut it?
ln a few days. Now rest or
l'll have to lock you in.
Thank god he's left!
Now l'm going to lock you in.
Now tell me the story.
Thakur and Sultan walked
into the eatery.
They walked in and you asked
Thakur... 'Recognise me'?
They fired and you fired back.
Now proceed further.
Then l caught Thakur and
we started fighting.
Wow!! Then?
l had him pinned down but l
was attacked from behind.
Then?
He choked me so l had
to let him go.
You let him go?
l didn't want to!
My hand was on his shirt
pocket and it tore...
And then?
Go on! What happened?
What are you doing?
Do you've your car?
- Yes. But why?
Give me my shoes.
Shoes? What have shoes
to do with the story?
Here! Are you crazy?
Be careful!
This is where l had
pinned him down
When the pocket tore off
something fell from it.
lt fell somewhere here.
Where?
What is it?
Someone's horoscope. - Whose?
Bala Thakur's? - Yes! lt's his!
lt is written by Ram Bandhu Gupta
from Bahid, Rajasthan.
He wants a map of Raiasthan
and all the evidence again.
Hurry up! He has arrived!
Good evening, sir.
What about the peppers?
They're from Raiasthan
and North Gujarat.
The sand isn't salty and so,
it's from Rajasthan.
This horoscope too
is from Rajasthan.
Bala Thakur's horoscope.
Someone in Bahid wrote it.
See this.
Do you know where Bahid is?
ln Rajasthan.
Here... on the border of
lndia and Pakistan.
Yadav! Go to Bahid and find
this astrologer...
...who has clients all
the way to Bombay.
When do we leave?
Sorry, sir!
We'll meet at the guest house
this evening. - Ok.
See you!
Sire! What's my future! Am l
suffering for my past sins?
ln your past birth you
were a policeman.
Was l a constable? - What?
Astrologer Gupta says l'll be
a policeman in this birth.
He's no astrologer!
He's a con man!
Smuggling is his real business.
He's Mirchi.
Selling pepper is a front.
Both peppers are of the
same quality. Trust me.
Trust me.
Your price is too high.
Mirchi's price is lower.
- He can even give it for free.
- What do you mean?
l'm a pepper trader while he
uses pepper as a cover.
Will you chew some tobacco?
This is for kids.
l'm looking for the real stuff.
Real stuff?
You get everything here. - Where?
Go to Mirchi's office.
Mirchi's office?
l'll wait here. Be quick.
Come in.
Meet my brother. - Some other time.
lf he finds out you didn't
come in, he'll scold me.
Surprise!
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday dear... - Thank you.
Happy birthday to you.
My heart says a tale and your
heart says the same.
Love, our hearts beat
to this rare elixir.
My heart says a tale and your
heart says the same.
Let's embrace in song...
...and dream in unison.
Let's embrace in song
and dream in unison.
The sweet pain in our hearts
beat to this rare elixir.
Love, our hearts beat
to this rare elixir.
My heart says a tale and your
heart says the same.
My heart feels your dreams your
heart feels my dreams.
Lost am l as our hearts beat
to this rare elixir.
Love, our hearts beat
to this rare elixir.
My heart says a tale and your
heart says the same.
Love, our hearts beat
to this rare elixir.
My heart says a tale and your
heart says the same.
Someone to see you, Ajay!
Good evening, sir. - You're late!
You were to come at seven!
Sorry!
There was work at the office!
Yadav needs you in Bahid.
lt's urgent!
Bahid in Rajasthan? - Yes!
Gulfam Hasan is there right now.
Where? ln Bahid?
Yes!
His ancestral house is near Bahid.
Will you deliver my letter to him?
Sure, he'll.
Don't mind...
Sure.
Where's Mirchi?
l'm ACP Rathod.
ACP Rathod from Mumbai?
From so far?
Yes!
Some jobs lead you far enough!
Of course!
Do you know him?
No... who is he?
And him?
No.
So you wrote his horoscope
without knowing him.
This is your chance to confess!
No one can save you after this.
Many people come to me to get
their horoscopes written.
lf you wish l can also
write your horoscope.
And l won't dare ask if you're
a constable or an ACP.
Also, l never take the
law into my hands.
But if l want to, l can write
the horoscope of the law.
Think it over for we know
everything about you.
lf you don't fall in line we too
can write your horoscope.
Saturn has turned retrograde!
How did this happen?
l think we're on the right track.
Stay here! Keep me informed
of his every move.
God be praised!
What a lovely coincidence!
Last time you gave me a lost
childhood treasure.
Today, like an angel, you
bring excellent news!
Please! l'm just human.
No! You're an angel!
A million copies of the
songs you gave me...
...are being released by Roshan.
One million!
This honour and admiration from
fans is thanks to you.
No! lt's thanks to your music
which is so similar to ours.
lt's not just similar.
lt's the same!
My music and my poetry
are rooted here.
Urdu was born in lndia and
so was classical music.
Why do you live all alone
in this house?
l'm never alone. Memories of my
ancestors keep me company.
This is my ancestral home.
We lost it during the partition.
Thanks to Roshan l'm permitted
to live here sometimes.
Every moment l spend here is
worth a lifetime to me!
- Any special request for supper?
- Ask our guest.
No, thank you.
l must leave. - Where?
Back to Mumbai.
Mumbai?
So you didn't come here to see me?
Well! l had some work here.
You'll not steal my happiness.
You'll stay here tonight.
But Gulfam sir...
Tradition here is that guests
can come at their own will...
...but can leave only at
the will of the host.
l promise to do the same before
l leave your county.
Mirchi!
At this hour?
Sire! - What is it?
Sire!
Punish me if l'm at fault...
...but don't play games with me.
You've ruined my sleep.
Tell me what's the matter?
A man comes from Mumbai and
threatened to arrest me.
Now l find that he's your guest.
What am l to make of it?
Are you talking about Ajay?
Not just Ajay!
He's ACP Ajay Singh Rathod.
lt was he who seized our
entire consignment.
ls he the one?
Yes.
l can kill him right now and
buy him in the desert...
...no one will know!
No. He's a friend...
...and killing a friend is treason.
lt's a big crime to kill
a police officer.
l'll not get entangled with
the law of this county.
Don't worry. l'll deal with him.
l'll handle him with
my friendship.
Peanuts!
Peanuts for sale! Who's that?
Where were you all these days?
- l left to get married.
Wife told me to change
my career so l did.
Was l wrong?
Recognise any of these guys?
Sir!
God! Death can change the
look of a man. - Be quick!
Most of these guys were in
and out of Victoria House.
Victoria House.
- lt's next to Sangam Bar.
We must foster brotherhood and
love been our to nations.
Politics has its place but art
and culture must have its own.
Yes! We too wish to have
such cultural exchanges.
Sure! Why not?
Hello... how do you do?
This is a friend who wishes
your blessings.
How is the general?
He's fine and sends you his
regards. He's disturbed.
He feels that your music has made
you forget your mission.
He's told me to remind you...
Remind me?
Thank you for reminding me.
Assure him that Gulfam is aware
of his responsibilities.
Yes!
You promised to create
a hundred Veerans... But?
But what?
But there is only one and
he too is undependable.
l was born here and understand
the realities of lndia better.
The war that l'm waging
is the one...
...that you should be fighting.
Tell the General that it's
easy to talk nonsense...
...sitting in a guarded
room in Karachi.
lf he's desperate let him come
here. l'll trade places.
Please don't get upset!
The general has full faith
in your abilities.
That's why he has trusted a
migrant mohajir like you.
l must meet Gulfam. - Sure. Go on.
Welcome, Ajay! This is Dr. Baig!
Baig is a poet at heart and
a bureaucrat by profession.
He has come all the way from
Karachi to attend this meet.
See that gentleman there with
Gulfam Hasan? He's ACP Rathod.
He's Gulfam's close
friend and is...
...with the Police Crime Branch.
Get him a plum posting so that
his life will be made.
l understand. lt will be done.
With so many fans in lndia you
must be mobbed in Pakistan.
l've many fans but l'm still
looked on as a mohajir.
Don't mind... what is a mohajir?
Mohajir?
They're Muslims from lndia who
sought refuge in Pakistan...
...in the hope of living as equals
in a new Muslim nation.
lnstead of being welcomed they
were rejected as mohajirs.
Fifty years have passed we're
still mohajirs. Not Pakistanis.
Am l right, Mr. Baig?
l refute that. You're like a
precious jewel to Pakistan.
Hell! That's Rathod!
Get everyone out! l'm leaving.
Stop. Quick!
Get out. lt's a police raid.
Police! Tell Shiva to leave!
Shiva! Police!
Let's go!
Stop!
He got away!
Never mind!
We now know their hideout.
Gather all evidence and
seal the building.
We've caught a few men.
Anyone talked yet? - No, sir.
l came into town yesterday.
lsn't it?
l'm just an electrician.
l'm innocent, sir.
So none of you're involved?
- No, sir!
Okay. Kill them all.
Sir!
Shoot them and report
it as an encounter.
Any last wish? Feed them.
Fried Chicken? Kababs? Booze?
Give them what they want
One minute, sir!
l swear l'm innocent!
Believe me! l've children!
This is your last chance. Confess.
We're poor people!
We didn't do anything!
l'm innocent!
lt's no use, sir.
They won't speak.
Go ahead and shoot them.
What... you mean it?
But the bullet shouldn't wound.
Fire to inches away from the ear.
Ok, sir.
Stop crying.
There's still time. Speak up.
Don't kill me please.
Don't kill me. Please.
l'll speak, sir.
Take the others out. - Get going!
Speak up!
All l know is the stuff
comes from Rajasthan.
Where is Sultan?
He's run away to Pakistan.
Who runs the business now? - Haji.
Who's Haji?
He runs a travel agency
from Victoria House.
When is the stuff expected again?
l don't know.
Haji just returned from Rajasthan.
Take him away!
Salim! - Yes, sir.
lnform Yadav in Bahid that
l need daily reports...
...from the lntelligence
Bureau in Rajasthan.
Check out who Haji is!
Keep tabs on him...
...but don't arrest him till
l order. - Ok, sir.
What is it, Mirchi?
You promised to take
care of your friend.
He has caught up with Haji...
...and also raided Victoria House.
Haji wants to get Salim
on our side...
...and then kill your friend.
Don't do that! lt will be our
loss if Ajay is killed.
Then what do we do?
Put him out of action.
Break his leg again!
Deliver goods to Veeran
in the meantime.
l'll get him out of this
case very soon!
Tell Haji to break his leg...
only his leg. - Ok, sire.
Greetings, Mr. Salim!
Greetings. Tell me.
lt's painful to see
a fellow Muslim...
...working with infidels...
...against us!
Muslim? Do you know what it means?
Yes! One who believes in lslam.
- Not just that.
A true Muslim must have
a pure conscience...
One whose conscience is
alive at all times.
A conscience as solid as rock...
...and as pure as dew.
Speak of being Muslim only if
you've such a conscience.
You're complicating matters.
l believe...
l believe in live and let live.
We tried to reason with Rathod.
We were willing to pay as
much as half-a-million.
So you've put a price
tag on ACP Rathod...
What's the price tag
for your county?
How many pieces of silver
will you sell it for?
l'm a businessman...
...and l believe in fair play.
And never with one of our own.
We're both Muslims.
We can sort things out.
Don't equate me with you!
l'm not like you!
You're a traitor!
Because of a few Muslims like
you we're all suspects.
Men like you betray
the county and...
...the whole community suffers.
- Enough of lectures!
Some day you'll come
to your senses...
...like your friend Rathod
would've realised by now.
What do you mean?
Go, save him!
lf you hurt him l'll
not spare you!
Don't mind, how do l drive?
We're home safe and sound!
- Thank you.
l'm safe and sound!
What about others!
Hey stay quiet!
Help!
Help! Stop them!
Please don't hurt my son!
Please stop them from
hurting my son!
Hold him.
Please don't hurt my son!
Please don't hurt my son! - Stop.
Help!
Shiva! The police! Run!
Salim! Catch them!
What are you doing? Ajay!
Ajay! Wait!
They got away! - Get the jeep!
We can get them at any time.
- Get the jeep!
Yadav has returned with vital
information. - Listen to me!
Mum! l'm fine!
Let them be.
We've enough to nail them.
The villages on the border are
conduits for drugs and guns
Unmanned camels smuggle the
contraband across the border.
How?
The camels are specially trained
to travel on their own...
...they fery the stuff across
without human supervision.
lntelligence reports suggest
the presence of...
...a few Pakistani spies
in these villages.
This one is Captain Javed Abbas...
...operating in Bahid as Shafi.
And this is Maior Aslam Baig.
He visited lndia recently
to attend a poetry meet.
- What's the matter, sir?
- Nothing.
lntelligence has intercepted
and taped a message.
A huge consignment of arms
will arrive in a few days.
We should prepare to
leave for Rajasthan.
Yes. l'll talk to the DCP.
Even l want to talk to you.
Come in.
Hurt your leg? - Nothing much, sir.
lf you...
lf you didn't want take
on this case...
...you should've informed me.
l'd have arranged a lucrative
posting for you.
What do you mean, sir?
You pretend to be honest and then
angle for plum postings.
l haven't angled for anything.
Then why did l get this order?
lt's a ploy to get
me off this case...
...as l'm close to solving it.
l must leave for Rajasthan
immediately.
Believe me, sir. Trust me.
l'm being shunted, sir.
Let me go. Please.
Fine! This order stays with me.
You've not received it.
No! l shan't let you
go! Forget this job!
You even got shot at!
- Mum! l must go!
Why can't they send someone else?
You were attacked!
You don't care enough!
See the way he limps.
You're hurt but you still
want to go to Rajasthan!
l won't allow it!
Stop him!
Why doesn't anyone stop him?
l won't let you go!
Don't mind.
l won't let you go!
l've lost one son!
You're all l've left!
Goodbye, Mother!
No! l won't let you go!
"l'm sleepless all night!
As l long to be your bride!"
"Gift me pearls and diamonds!
As l long to be your bride!"
"Will you die for me? ...oh yes!"
"Will you entice me... oh yes!"
"Want to save your life...
then make me your Queen!"
"Are you true to love... oh yes!"
"Live a life of love...
if you wish to live!"
"Hold me to your lips...
if you wish to live!"
"l'm sleepless all night!
As l long to be your bride!"
"Gift me pearls and diamonds!
As l long to be your bride!"
The stuff has arrived!
Be careful this time.
Rathod is here!
Come with me!
Salim! - Yes... - Shafi...
Come.
Come with me!
Go by the godown!
Come with me!
Where's the boss? - l don't know.
Where's he?
Come
Today you'll die!
ACP Rathod.
Hurry!
He has escaped.
l know where they're headed.
ACP Rathod.
Crime Branch. Mumbai Police.
Seize all this stuff!
We're going to Bahid Fort.
Ask the control room to
send your forces there.
C'mon!
Get up!
Come on!
Control room... hello...
Get out of here!
l can't!
They've blocked the entrance.
Go up! Let me know when the
back-up forces arrive.
Yadav! Baiju! Stay here!
Salim! Come with me.
Move.
Stop firing!
Ask your men to stop firing!
Yes, Sire. Stop firing!
Gulfam Hasan!
You, Major Baig and Mirchi Seth...
...will be arrested for spreading
terrorism in this county.
You cannot escape! Surrender!
How can you accuse us,
Ajay, without any evidence?
Evidence is this traitor Mirchi...
...and Haji, who is in our custody.
Who is he? l don't know him!
l do know Mirchi because he
lives in the neighbourhood.
You can ask him what
he's doing here.
What evidence is this?
l don't know Mirchi or Haji.
But you do know Shafi. Right?
A captain in your spy agency lSl,
where you're a Major.
We've caught him red-handed
smuggling arms.
Now your terrorist acts will
be exposed to the world.
l'm a diplomat representing
my county...
...a guest who is here on your
Government's invitation.
l have diplomatic immunity.
Touch me and you'll see the
repercussions in lslamabad.
Let's wait! Once the force
arrives, how will they escape?
We don't have enough evidence
against Gulfam Hasan.
He'll get away scot free.
Let's kill them and claim that
we did it in self-defence.
No!
l won't let them die so easily.
The force is here!
Salim! Give me your gun!
You don't seem to understand
l've diplomatic immunity.
To hell with your diplomatic
immunity!
That can be of use if you
live through this!
l'll give you iust one
last chance to live...
...this Gulfam Hasan whom
we loved and trusted...
...has cheated me and
betrayed my county!
l won't let him walk away alive!
lf you want to live...
kill Gulfam Hasan!
l'll then free you and Shafi.
But why don't you kill him?
The law here forbids it!
What's the guarantee you'll
free me after l kill him?
What nonsense is this?
You'll have to trust me.
You've no option.
Sir! The force will be
here in five minutes.
Hurry up, Baig.
Once the force arrives l'll
not be able to help you.
Take this gun and kill Gulfam.
Baig! Baig!
Are you out of your mind?
You want to kill me?
Don't you know who l'm?
l know, but a singer can't be
saved at the cost of soldiers.
Your death won't really
affect my county...
...as you aren't a Pakistani.
You're a mohajir.
ls it?
Until now wasn't l a mohajir?
Now that your life is at stake
l've become expendable.
Mirchi! Tell your men to kill him!
Mirchi! Don't interfere!
lt's between them.
l'll make you a state witness.
Stand by us. That's the best.
Ajay! l saved your life
ice from this man.
This man who you want to
make a state witness...
...wanted to kill you!
ls this how you pay me back?
Ajay! Ajay!
Ajay!
You played a game with me.
l'm defeated.
You tricked me into killing a man.
l've committed a grave
sin with these hands.
Today you lay hands on a gun
and realise that it's a sin!
What about the guns you gave
others to kill innocents?
Gulfam Hasan, my county gave
you love and respect...
...gave you adulation...
...and what did you give in return?
Terrorism and bloodshed!
l didn't make you a killer!
You were always one...
...l just ripped off the mask.
The world knows that
l'm a true artiste.
Maybe but from now on
you'll be known...
...as a traitor and assassin.
You're a criminal and you'll
be punished for your crime.
This land on which
you stand today...
...and order me...
...was ruled by my ancestors.
l grew up in this palace...
We've ruled this land.
One day, for no reason...
...we were driven
out like cattle...
To render families homeless
is a crime.
To snatch everything from
someone is a crime.
To orphan children is a crime.
What they did to us fifty
years ago was a crime!
Yes! lt was a crime.
lt was because of the partition.
You weren't the only one
singled out to suffer.
Millions were killed,
orphaned and rendered homeless.
lt happened on both sides
of the divide.
Sadly some people want to push
us back to the same situation.
They want to use religion
to divide us again but...
...we won't let them succeed,
no matter what their religion.
Gulfam Hasan,
we didn't celebrate the partition.
We remember it with
sadness and grief.
We want to forget the past and
rise above that trauma but...
...you and your kin rip open old
scars to make new wounds.
And we'll keep doing that!
For our wounds are deep...
...and they won't heal so easily.
l wish that you and your future
generations remember...
...the atrocities committed
against our community.
Every time our weapons
rain death...
...then you'll realise the pain...
...and the wounds suffered
by our community.
Stop talking nonsense!
What do you mean by
your community?
lf you mean Muslims then lndia has
more Muslims than Pakistan.
Guns do not discriminate.
Even Muslims die by your bullets.
Your deeds bring dishonour
to the Muslims in lndia.
By spreading death,
you aren't helping your community.
All this talk of community
and religion is a fraud.
Men like you belong nowhere.
You and this Mirchi Seth!
He bites the hand that feeds him!
The rogue was willing
to sell his county.
People like you are enemies
of humanity.
Gulfam Hasan.
l regret...
...having befriended you.
Salim, arrest him.
Gulfam Hasan, the renowned
Pakistani singer, is dead.
He committed suicide at
Bahid in Rajasthan.
His fans all over the
world are shocked.
He'd expressed a desire
to be buried in Bahid...
...while Pakistan wants his
body to to be returned.
Government sources link him
to anti-national forces.
How could an artiste like Gulfam
Hasan do such deeds?
Artistes are human.
Some good. Some bad.
Twinkle twinkle little stars.
lnspector Salim? Here?
Yes, but what are you doing here?
l'm going to Dubai. - Dubai?
l'm now into import-export.
Good we met!
Let me give you one solid tip!
Remember Veeran?
He's here! - Where?
Don't mind...
how long is it going to take?
They should be here soon.
Mother has made a
delicacy for you.
Excuse me, sir.
Veeran?
Go home and tell Mum l'll
be late for dinner.
Where are you going?
Something important has come up.
Don't mind.
