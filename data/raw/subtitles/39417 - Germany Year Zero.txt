GERMANY YEAR ZERO
FIRST PRIZE - LOCARNO INTERNATIONAL
FILM FESTIVAL - 1948
In memory of my son Romano.
- Roberto Rossellini
When ideologies distance themselves
from Christian morality and piety,
the very foundation of human life,
they become criminal folly.
Even childhood innocence is tainted
and drawn from a horrible crime
to a lesser one in which,
through its own ingenuity,
it believes to find
freedom from guilt.
This movie,
shot in Berlin in the summer of 194 7,
aims only to be an objective
and true portrait
of this large, almost
totally destroyed city
where 3.5 million people live
a terrible, desperate life,
almost without realizing it.
They live as if tragedy
were natural,
not because of strength
or faith,
but because they are tired.
This is not an accusation
or even a defense
of the German people.
It is an objective
assessment.
Yet if anyone,
after watching
Edmund Koeler's story,
feels that something needs
to be done--
that German children need
to relearn to love life--
then the efforts of those
who made this movie
will be greatly rewarded.
The Germans that work
with the Americans...
they also get 50 grams
of margarine.
What's the use?
We'll die no matter what.
When are they going
to give us a break?
If you're tired,
throw yourself in that grave.
What's this?
Slacking off this morning?
You've been working three hours
and you're already tired!
Don't you understand, the grave
has to be 2.5 meters by 75?
- It looks all right to me.
- Leave, if you don't want to work!
I've been working for hours!
That boy is doing nothing!
- What's that little boy doing here?
- How old are you?
- I'm already 15.
- It's not true.
- He's no more than 13.
- Look at me. Are you lying?
I know you. You went to school
with my son. You're only 12.
- Is that true?
- Leave me alone. So what if I work?
- Show me your work papers.
- I forgot them at home.
- Not true. They're all liars.
- They steal the bread from us.
Then they sell their cards
in the black market.
Back to work!
Let's go!
What are you doing here?
Go on home. Move it!
Leave that coal alone!
Go on! Move along!
Run, run.
You, too-- go away!
Here-- you used 10 kilowatts
more than last month.
- What's going on?
- He's checking the power meter.
You've gone over the limit.
You'll be fined.
- I told you!
- There are 10 of us in this house!
Five different families,
understand?
There is no provision in the law.
I'm sorry, but I must fine you.
- Do you have any cigarettes?
- I gave them all away.
- Damn it!
- I still have this.
You-- did you bring
anything?
Only coal.
I'll carry the overuse
to the next month.
Thank you. Good day.
See what I get
for taking you in?
Last month the gas,
this month the electricity--
What do you expect when you
have to take in so many?
Starting today, things will change.
First, no hot water. It's a luxury!
Do you want us
to go around dirty?
I always use cold water.
Nobody can say I'm dirty.
I'm not going to give up
the hair dryer, Father.
- Quiet. Don't be foolish.
- It's the Koelers' fault.
That old man-- I'll get rid of him
if he doesn't die first.
Let him talk, Edmund.
Don't answer back. Let's go!
- What's going on?
- Nothing, nothing.
Five families suffer
because of one useless old man.
Tea, compresses,
hot-water bottles...
Living here has become
impossible.
We have to be understanding.
He's very sick.
Yes, one is sick,
the other's pregnant.
- I've got problems too.
- I'm only saying...
What do you know
about anything?
You were out of the country
when it was hell here.
- Is she mad at me?
- No, don't pay attention.
Children,
what is going on?
The meter reader says
we use too much power.
Are they going
to cut it off?
We managed
to talk him out of it.
You're all dirty,
as usual.
Tell me-- did you get
the Number 2 Card?
No, they kicked me out
because I'm not 15 yet.
I knew that would happen.
Still, I'm glad you're not
going to go anymore.
That's too much work
for a boy your age.
It would have meant
more to eat-- for Karl-Heinz, too.
Did you hear that,
Karl-Heinz?
Son, you know that poor Edmund,
at his age,
can't possibly
support all of us?
He's still a child.
But you...
what do you do?
You keep hiding.
You didn't even register
and get a food card like we did.
How can four people live
with only three cards?
What is it going to take?
If you register you can work.
You'd get a Number 2 Card,
and we wouldn't need to go
to the black market.
I've given up everything.
I sold everything I could.
Now I have no strength.
Now it's your turn.
What you're doing is stupid.
What are you afraid of?
I don't want to end up
in a concentration camp.
I've had enough of this!
What do you want from me?
Didn't you read the papers?
Even the radio announced it--
Ex-military only need to register
at the Police Office.
You show up
like anybody else and--
Yes, and when I tell them
which regiment I was in
and that I fought in the streets,
all the way home...
do you think
they'll let me go?
But it was the war.
They can't condemn you for it.
It was your duty
as a soldier.
Easy for you to say!
It's not your life!
What if it were a trap
for stupid people?
What are you afraid of?
Have we had any problems yet?
I'll go, but if they trap me,
I don't know what I'll do!
No, Karl-Heinz, you mustn't go!
Stay here!
We'll take care of you.
I'll find anotherjob.
Eva will too, you'll see.
We must find a way to get money.
Don't worry, dear.
We'll do anything to save Karl-Heinz.
I'll go see Mrs. Rademaker.
She said she has something for me.
I'll be right back.
We've come this far, haven't we?
Here, Papa, get some rest.
Listen--
I need to talk to you.
- What is it?
- Not here. Come to my room.
That snitch will see
and report me.
Dill is a friend.
Don't worry.
So-called ''victims of Nazism''--
we know them well!
Come to the bathroom.
Nobody will see us there.
See if anyone's
out there.
There's no one.
Be quiet.
Karl-Heinz--
I've held my tongue for so long...
I didn't want to argue
in front of Papa.
You know how sick he is.
We must spare him any excitement.
I didn't start it.
I want to be left alone.
- Because you're a coward!
- Maybe.
You're so selfish.
You don't care where we get food.
You only care about eating it.
Did I tell you
to send Edmund to work?
You don't say anything.
You just hide--
and yet you want to eat and drink.
You don't ask where I go every night.
All that matters is that I come back
with a couple of cigarettes for you.
Did I smoke them?
No, but you know that cigarettes
are like money.
Should I thank you for that?
Nowadays everybody does it.
- They do even worse things.
- You see?
Then tell me
to sell myself!
- Go away!
- I'm sorry--
I shouldn't have said that.
We're both nervous.
Our situation's getting desperate.
- Every day it gets harder.
- You don't need to tell me that.
Don't you see?
It's impossible for the boy alone--
I know that too!
I think about it, too.
That's all you talk about.
My suffering for all these years,
doesn't that count for anything?
Don't say that.
You're being unfair.
When you were thirsty in Africa,
when you were freezing in Russia,
our thoughts were with you,
always!
I don't want to suffer anymore!
I want to die and end it.
Don't say that!
Maybe the worst is over.
Help us keep up hope.
Gina, what are you doing?
Come into the other room.
No, Mommy,
I like it here.
Leave her here.
She's no trouble.
How can you work
with so little light?
- We have to save power.
- It's not waste, it's needed.
- Can I help a little?
- Thank you, I'll take care of it.
You don't trust me,
just like everybody else.
- No, I...
- They look at me like I was a spy.
- No...
- And why?
Because during the war
I went away and came back.
Maybe it's because
your political ideas are a little...
That's an excuse!
The Rademakers hate me
because I take up
one of their rooms.
Are they going to send us away
from here too, Mommy?
No, dear, we'll stay.
But be good.
You share the room
with Miss Koeler.
They look
like very good people,
but they don't like me, either.
Isn't that true?
They're afraid somebody
will report their son!
Let's go, Gina.
By the way,
I'll give you some old clothes
to make something for the baby.
Thank you.
Why don't you like her?
She's always willing to help out.
I don't believe in others
''helping out.''
These days,
we have to help ourselves.
I understand, my boy.
I'm not a monster!
Keeping you here means a lot
of sacrifices, you know.
Even if I wanted it,
I don't know how you could help me.
Couldn't I get things
for you?
What ''things''?
You know I hate the black market.
I could barter things for you.
That's what
the barter center is for!
They're all cheats. Why don't you
let him sell the scale?
What? My scale?
How am I going to weight myself?
We've done without
more important things, my dear.
You can diet
without the scale.
- One more thing!
- How much should I ask for it?
You tell me.
How much do you think we can get?
- No less than 200 marks.
- Not enough.
I want 300. Nothing less.
I'll be able to buy
300 grams of butter.
Edmund? Sorry.
Dinner is getting cold.
Then I have to go out.
Hurry up.
- Yes, I'll be right there.
- Good evening.
- Miss Rademaker?
- Yes?
- Can you show me the scale?
- Here it is.
Did you hear?
His sister goes out every night too.
She's really shameless.
Now she's acting like Blank.
You shouldn't let these people
get near our daughter.
One of these days
I'll kick them out, the tarts.
What have you got against my sister?
Why are you always mad at us?
You shut up! Get out!
Take the scale and don't come back
without the money, is that clear?
All right, Mr. Rademaker.
I'll be back tomorrow morning.
- Eva?
- What?
Where are you going?
- Out.
- Tell me why you go out.
- What now? I go out every night.
- Why do you go out every night?
What a question.
For a little diversion.
- Hurry up. We have to go.
- All right, I'm coming.
You know they complain
if we're late.
Go on ahead!
I'll catch up with you.
Eva, I don't want you
to go out every night.
Edmund,
what's got into you now?
What are you thinking?
What's wrong, dear?
Look me in the eyes.
Now, go to bed, okay?
Stop all those bad thoughts.
Miss, I'd like
to buy a whiskey.
Do you like it?
We Americans like it very much.
- Do you like it?
- Yes, thank you.
Two whiskeys.
- May I offer you a cigarette?
- Thank you.
Waiter, two cognacs.
No, not now.
I'll smoke it later.
Two cognacs, please.
Hi, George! Can I speak
with you a moment?
- Excuse me a moment, miss.
- Certainly.
- That Frenchman is really nice.
- Yes, he is very kind.
Listen, dear, you should wise up.
You passed up a good chance.
- I wish I were you.
- I'm only here for a good time.
What are you waiting for?
To get old to learn about men?
- I don't want it that way.
- You're a fool.
Lots of girls come in for a good time.
They meet someone and get married.
Maybe I'm a fool, but I wouldn't look
for a husband here.
- Hi, Eva, having fun?
- Very much so.
Come with us
to the Piccadilly Club.
I can't. I'm going back home.
But I'll walk part of the way with you.
Idiots wait in line.
Smart people go to the black market.
- Do you know Meyer's son?
- The bricklayer's son?
A 10-year-old kid.
At the black market,
he makes more money
than his whole family.
Hurry up,
or there'll be nothing left.
For what they give us
there is always time.
Easy for you to say, but at home
they want to eat every day!
Get in line. Are you so pregnant
that you have to go first?
Some days
I've got no strength.
Three men to feed
and the pot's always empty.
Listen, I was offered butter
at 200 marks a pound.
Imagine that. My father's pension
is 7 4 marks-- when they pay it.
And you waste your evenings
to take home four cigarettes.
I get 20 marks for them.
And what do you buy with it?
A few pounds of potatoes!
I told you,
you're a fool.
Maybe you're right,
but that's how I am.
- Are you waiting for Wolf?
- Yes.
Don't you think
he would understand?
Many men were prisoners.
When they got back, they understood.
- He'll understand too.
- It's not that.
The thought of him
gives me strength, helps me go on.
But that's not all.
So I waste my evenings for cigarettes.
Would I get more if I gave in?
What are you getting
out of it?
You're just as hungry
and as miserable as I am...
like the others are.
Don't you see?
So I might as well hold on
and hope one day he'll be back.
- What about your family?
- I'm doing everything I can.
- You don't try very hard, my dear.
- I know...
but I don't have
the strength to do more.
I was the same way.
But after a couple of drinks,
you'll find the courage.
What are you doing here,
trying to compete with us?
I don't have to explain myself.
Go away.
Who gave you this scale?
What are you doing?
Leave it alone.
We sell here.
Go someplace else.
Calm down, calm down!
- How much for this scale?
- 300 marks.
Are you crazy?
For this rusty old junk?
Junk? Are you kidding?
It's almost new.
All right,
I will trade it for...
Where are you going?
Let's see... wait, slow down,
what are you worried about?
- Give me back my scale!
- I'm not running away.
Hey, come here.
Go on, take it.
Look, I'll give you this!
- What is it?
- Canned meat! American!
This isn't enough!
I need 300 marks.
I'm feeling generous today,
I'll give you another one.
- I don't want it!
- Scram, even that's too much!
- I want my scale back!
- Enough, go way!
- Give me the scale back!
- Get going, Paul.
- Wait! Give me the scale!
- If you come back, we'll beat you up!
- Good morning, Mr. Enning.
- Weren't you one of my students?
- Yes, Mr. Enning.
- My memory's good.
Tell me, what's your name?
My name is Edmund Koeler.
Edmund Koeler, yes.
First desk to the left.
You've really grown up.
You're a nice big boy.
How is your father doing?
My father's sick, very sick.
Didn't you have a brother too?
In the Wermacht?
Yes, Karl-Heinz. He was
in the military, now he is home.
I see. Then he's out of work,
like me.
You're not teaching anymore?
No. I don't share the ideas
of the people in charge...
with regard
to teaching children.
Let's change the subject,
my dear Edmund.
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing special.
Then walk with me for a while,
if you wish.
Yes, Mr. Enning,
with pleasure.
I'm always happy
to run into my old students.
Hey, Enning.
Ha! You're here!
- You didn't recognize me?
- Of course. Work service?
- Work? More like slavery.
- We're in bad shape.
They used to call us ''National
Socialists,'' now we're ''Nazis.''
- Yes.
- Mr. Enning, the tram is here.
Goodbye, then.
We're leaving!
Your friend,
is he in the work service?
- Didn't you see? He clears the ruins.
- No mandatory labor for you?
Luckily, no.
My brother thought he'd have to.
He stayed away.
He was right. They all should,
those that share our ideas.
Remember? A long time ago,
your father falsified a document
to get you out of the Hitler Youth,
but you said right away
that it was false.
You knew your duty.
I should have reported him.
But I didn't do it because I like you.
- Here we are.
- Did you always live here?
- No.
- Then only recently?
Yes I'm staying with a friend.
Come up. I'll see if I can help you.
- Well, it's the schoolteacher.
- Finally.
Good morning, sir.
- Did you go there?
- Yes, sir.
- That boy, who is he?
- A former student.
Nice boy.
Did you get those papers?
- No, sir.
- Why?
They said to come back tomorrow
to get the permit.
- Did you bring the nail polish?
- Here, madam.
I hope the color is right.
Very pretty.
What do you think?
Edmund, say hello.
- Good evening.
- Goodbye.
- Madam, goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- It's a nice color, right?
- A little loud.
What do you know
about women's things!
Nice boy. Who is he?
- A former student of mine.
- I understand.
- Is he here?
- Yes. He's on the balcony.
Come.
Here we are!
Let's take this bag...
and put it here.
Now, tell me, what have you
been doing all this time?
- Nothing special.
- Come sit down, close to me.
Tell me, what do they teach you
in school now? Democracy?
I don't know.
I can't go to school anymore.
Why is that?
You don't like the new teachers?
That's not the reason.
Now I have to work.
Work? Why?
There are four of us at home
and we only have three cards.
Poor Edmund!
How come your brother
doesn't have a card?
He never reported
to the police.
He fought in the streets
until the Allied troops arrived.
- Now he's afraid.
- Don't worry, we'll help him.
That's what I wanted to ask you.
Could you find me work? Anything?
I've done a little of everything.
I even tried to dig out graves,
but they didn't give me
the Number 2 Card.
Oh, dear.
- Already back?
- Yes sir, Mr. Von Laubniz.
This is a former student of mine.
- Did you carry out the orders?
- No sir, I'll try again tomorrow.
- You've done nothing yet?
- No, sir.
- Don't forget. You've got to succeed.
- Yes sir, Mr. Von Laubniz.
Now, my dear Edmund,
I intend to help, but remember,
not a word to anybody.
- I won't.
- Understand?
There is nothing wrong about it,
but I don't want word to get out.
Now listen, I'll give you
something to sell.
You must tell everybody
it's yours.
Even the people living
in this house. Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
- Go to the court building.
There you'll find many
English and American people.
They are all gullible.
Try to sell them this record.
Give me your bag.
It's a speech by the Führer.
Here, take the player too.
And this--
don't say I gave it to you.
- Yes.
- Now make me proud of you.
- How much did you get?
- One million.
- Think you can fool me?
- Mind your own business, then.
I made it,
I'm like one of them.
- Kristel, Jo-- come here a moment!
- What do you want?
Take this boy to the court building.
He has something he wants to sell.
- Okay.
- See that they don't cheat him.
- Understood.
- Go with them. Go on.
Come, let's go.
Wouldn't you like to see
other countries?
- What for? They're just the same.
- Edmund!
Get going, hurry up!
Hurry up!
- He's coming now.
- We're wasting too much time.
Here, we'll play the record
right away.
That's how you want
to do business.
- Here it is.
- Good-for-nothing!
Where are you going?
You were to return to me.
What are you worried about?
We're not running away.
- Tell me, how did it go?
- Very well, Mr. Enning.
- How much for the record?
- I got 200 marks.
- Where are they?
- Here they are.
Here, take this.
10 marks for you.
As you see,
I keep my promises.
Come see me again, okay?
- Bye.
- Let's go, Kristel.
Hey, guys!
Stay here and wait for me.
Why do we have to wait
for him here?
When he does business
he wants to be alone.
- What business?
- Don't be naive.
You think we get money
from the bank?
I want to see.
Let's go.
What you are doing here?
Idiot, why'd you come here
instead of waiting?
What are you doing here?
- I sell stuff.
- What stuff?
- This.
- What's that?
Soap.
You said there was a job for me
and we're just selling soap?
I'll show you how much
you can make selling soap.
Go, wait for me outside.
Take him away.
Would you like to buy
some soap, madam?
- How much is it?
- I'll sell it for 50 marks.
- I want to see it first.
- Come here, to the side.
Here, smell it.
It's American.
- It looks good, but expensive.
- Not expensive. For you, 40 marks.
Okay.
You scoundrel!
Thief! Thief!
Stop him! Stop him!
Hurry.
Come with me.
See how you get the dupes?
Nobody's here yet.
I told everybody to meet here.
Wait here.
I'll go look for Ali Baba.
- Is he your brother?
- Who? Jo? No.
- You're always together.
- So? What about it?
Wherever he goes,
you're always behind.
And that makes him
my brother? Hey, Jo.
- Hi, little monkey.
- Keep your hands to yourself.
- Snob!
- Beast!
Who does she think she is?
By the way, Franz, I found
another great girl.
I'll introduce you tonight.
Tonight there'll be another train
loaded with potatoes.
Potatoes?
Good, we'll get some.
- Where?
- The police will be there.
- Where did Jo go?
- I know where to find him.
- Hey, Jo.
- What do you want?
Can you sell me
that piece of soap?
- Do you have money?
- How much do you want?
- For you, 40.
- I only have 10 with me.
Give me credit. I'll pay you the rest
tomorrow or the day after.
- Okay.
- Give it to me.
Okay.
Hide it. Don't let people see it.
Wait!
First I want to check.
You cheated me!
Son of a bitch.
Good night.
Sleep well.
- Where are you going now?
- Sorry, but tonight I've got a date.
Where are we now?
I don't know this area.
Well, watch out
for yourself.
I live in Alex.
How do I get back at this hour?
You don't have to go back home.
Where am I supposed to sleep?
I don't know anybody here.
It's up to you.
Everything is empty around here.
By myself?
With her. Why not?
She's not your type?
- You see, Jo, I--
- Afraid of women?
- No, but--
- She looks pretty enough to me.
Go ahead.
Treat him well. He's a friend.
- Idiot!
- Don't be stupid, go for it.
Wait, Jo-- the potatoes?
Where's my share?
What a pain. Here they are.
Where are you going to put them?
Here, in the bag.
- So few? My share is half.
- I can't put any more in your bag.
It doesn't matter,
I'll find a way to carry them.
- I'll give you the rest tomorrow.
- Promise?
Sure, sure. Goodbye, guys.
Have fun and sleep well.
And treat him well,
he's green.
- Let's go. Come with me.
- Jo, wait! Wait a moment!
Let him go.
Come with me.
This time you did it, my boy.
You'll get in trouble.
Why?
You're too young
to stay out all night.
- Now what do I do?
- Bear it and be quiet.
You see, Mr. Kruger,
I ran into--
Don't tell me these stories.
Save them for your sister.
Here, go inside.
- Eva.
- Edmund, finally.
I was afraid something
had happened to you.
We were all scared, you know?
A bad boy, that's what you are.
- Miss Koeler, what's happening?
- Nothing. Edmund came home.
- Thank goodness.
- You can stay in bed.
Go ahead, scat!
Where have you been all night?
What did you do?
I didn't do anything wrong.
You must believe me.
I want to know where you've been.
Answer me.
Well, to get some potatoes.
All night for a few potatoes?
I'll get more tomorrow.
Look, Eva.
Papa's awake.
Hear how he's coughing?
- He was sick all night.
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.
- Eva, Eva!
Yes, Papa.
Edmund's back.
Come here.
Closer.
It wasn't my fault.
I was with other boys--
Enough!
I don't want to hear any lies.
At your age,
you should be ashamed.
He didn't mean any harm, Papa.
He wanted to get something to eat.
- I'll do without.
- Me too.
- I'd rather die of hunger.
- Easy for you to say.
I can't stand it anymore,
here in this bed.
Calm down, Papa.
He won't do it again.
Show him how many potatoes
you brought.
Look!
There is even canned meat.
No, the canned meat
isn't for us.
- Who's it for?
- Mr. Rademaker.
Well?
Did you fix it yet?
It's not that easy,
Mr. Rademaker.
- The main cable goes through here.
- But they'll see it was tampered with.
As long as we both don't end up
in jail for stealing power.
Nothing to worry about.
There are five families here.
Who is going to find out who did it?
- Here, Mr. Rademaker.
- And what do you want?
- I brought you these cans.
- Who asked for them?
- I sold the scale.
- Where are the 300 marks?
Those cans are all
they wanted to give me.
How do you dare bring me
this junk for my scale?
Are you trying to poison
everybody with this?
- I don't think they're that bad.
- Then you can have them!
Thank you, Mr. Rademaker.
- Take them to my wife right way.
- Okay.
Tell me the truth now.
What did you do with the money?
- What money?
- The money you got for the scale.
- Did you give it to your father?
- I swear that's not true.
You're not going to cheat me, boy.
I know you'll do anything for money.
You got into my house--
The housing superintendent
sent us here.
Yes, I have to put up with it.
You're suffocating us in here.
Your father is a pain.
Always complaining.
He's waiting to die--
give us some peace!
- Where do you want to go?
- To the bathroom.
Wait. Let me help you.
Thank you, my dear.
Be careful.
- Your plate is on the stove.
- Close the door.
Do you want some,
Karl-Heinz?
No, I don't want any.
Eva made it for you. Eat.
Do you want a cigarette?
It's an American one.
No. Eva would pester me
all day long.
This isn't one of Eva's.
Who gave you money
to buy cigarettes?
I didn't buy it.
It was a gift.
Who from? Those bad boys
you go stealing with?
It wasn't boys.
It was a girl.
- You should be ashamed.
- Why? Everybody does it.
That's not a reason.
Her name is Kristel. She's all alone
and sleeps in a basement.
She's a nice girl.
You know, I like her.
She always gives cigarettes
to her friends.
You should have a woman
that takes care of you.
A woman?
That's all I need!
Like this bitch of a life
wasn't enough!
Don't take it like that.
Have courage!
I had plenty of courage.
A soldier can lose everything
but his courage.
Now I'm not a soldier anymore.
Now I'm less than worthless--
an extra mouth to feed.
I'd be better off
jumping out the window.
Edmund! Come, hurry!
Help me, Karl-Heinz.
Papa is having another attack.
We need to call the doctor.
- You go.
- Me?
No, I'll go.
I know where he is.
Keep your spirit up.
It's nothing serious.
The heart is very weak.
His overall condition is bad.
What can we do?
First, he needs nutritious food.
Fats, vitamins.
How can we do that, Doctor?
With the cards we have
we can't get more.
Yes, I know.
It's the same all over.
The best thing would be
to get him into a hospital.
But they are all more than full.
Listen, Doctor,
couldn't we at least try?
Cases worse than this
have not been admitted.
But I'll try. I know some people
in Health Services.
Did you hear, Papa?
Maybe you'll go to the hospital!
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Imagine, you'll eat what you want.
- You'll get three meals a day.
- Yes, something warm.
Wait, wait.
I can't guarantee anything.
I'll try. I hope to manage it.
Goodbye. I'll let you know.
Thank you, Doctor.
- Happy, Papa? Feeling better here?
- Yes, better, much better.
Not so loud. They'll send you home
if they know you're better.
You're right.
The doctor said the same thing.
I have to tell you.
This place is great.
- I'm glad, Papa.
- You know what we eat here?
First soup, than some meat
with vegetables.
Unbelievable! Fresh vegetables!
Milk, too. This much of it.
- Really?
- Yes, and every day.
I'm happy they treat you well.
In the evening,
they give us a cup of warm broth!
You'll see-- pretty soon
you'll be able to get up.
I know...
but when I think of you all...
No, don't worry about us.
It's a big relief to know
that you're better, believe me.
I'm not a burden anymore.
Isn't it true, Eva?
- True, Papa.
- You're a good person.
- Will Eva be back soon?
- She's at the hospital. Wait for her.
- Is it okay to smoke in here?
- Of course.
- Would you like one?
- I don't feel like smoking.
Wait,
I'll get you a match.
- Listen, do you have a match?
- No, we're out.
- Then go buy some.
- With what money?
- Ask Rademaker.
- No, don't worry. I'll ask Blank.
I have to see her too.
- Oh, here you are!
- Why? What's going on?
It's not urgent. I'll tell you later.
I'll wait for you at Blank's.
- How is Papa?
- Much better.
Here things get worse
each day that goes by.
- Eva, they've cut the power.
- The power? Why?
They discovered someone
was stealing it.
- Who did it?
- Someone in the house.
- Rademaker says it was us.
- As usual!
- That's why he was screaming.
- That black marketeer.
One day I'll smash his head.
''Smash his head.''
You're such a big talker.
But when it comes
to helping us, you do nothing.
Are you starting that again?
- Is your conscience clear?
- I only carried out my duty.
Then you shouldn't be worried.
Everyone says you should go.
- All spies. They want to catch me.
- Even an Allied officer said so.
Here you go
about the Allied officers!
What do you care
of our problems?
As long as Papa is at the hospital,
there's one less mouth to feed.
But when he comes back
we'll have nothing at home.
I'll do it. I'll get something.
Now I know how to do it.
You hear that, Karl-Heinz?
See how Edmund's becoming a thief?
- Do you want him in jail?
- Eva, leave me alone.
Go dance with your Americans!
Mr. Enning, wait, Mr. Enning.
What's going on, Edmund?
Wait a moment.
I want to tell you something.
- Come back later or tomorrow.
- It's something important.
I'm very busy now.
I don't have time.
It's about my father.
- Go ahead, what do you want?
- Could we talk alone?
Wait for me, dear.
So, what happened?
Tomorrow my father will be
dismissed from the hospital.
At home, we have no food,
I don't have work, neither does Eva.
My brother still won't report
to the police to get his card.
I understand,
but what can I do?
My father needs treatment.
Can't you help me?
- What can I do?
- There is nothing to do.
Times are hard for everybody.
Worse for old and weak people.
You've done what you could.
You can't change destiny.
- And, if he dies?
- If he dies, he dies.
We all die sooner or later.
Would you rather die yourself
to let an old man live?
General...
Is this one
of your students too?
No, just a young friend.
Come with me.
I want to give you something.
Did I make myself clear?
Enough of this sentimentality.
Life is what it is.
We've been shaped
by different conditions.
You're afraid
of your father dying.
Learn from the natural world.
The strong eliminate the weak.
You need the courage
to sacrifice the weak.
It's a natural law,
for humans as well.
What counts in a situation
like ours is to survive.
Edmund, don't be foolish.
Know your responsibilities.
Goodbye.
Papa.
Edmund!
Come here.
Sit here, closer.
Like this.
Give me a kiss.
It was good of you
to come and visit me.
In these four days,
I've gotten better.
For you too at home,
it must have been a relief.
Papa, you know
that without you...
Time to check your temperature,
Mr. Koeler.
- This boy? Is this your son?
- Yes, the youngest.
He's very handsome.
- Sit down. It's all right.
- Thank you.
Unfortunately,
I'll be a burden again.
I'm of no use anymore.
It would be better if I die.
I've even considered killing myself,
but I don't have the courage.
I drag this life around
like a burden...
for me and for you.
Take this, Papa.
- Sit down at the table, boys.
- Do we move it a little more?
- Yes, you can see better there.
- Edmund, help me.
There.
- A little more?
- Yes, a little more.
Wait, Papa.
I'll peel them for you.
Only potatoes?
Unfortunately,
I couldn't make soup.
You had enough time
to cook a warm soup.
That's not why.
I didn't have any flour or lard.
Do you at least
have some tea?
No, we're out of that, too.
My God.
It would've been better
if I had stayed at the hospital...
rather than come back home
and burden everybody again.
I have to watch your misery
without being able to help.
Why do I have to live
like this?
Lord... why don't you
call me to You?
You mustn't talk like that, Papa.
Yes. It would be a solution...
for me and for you.
Be patient.
Things will change.
If Karl-Heinz had only
gone to the police.
I was hoping by now
he'd see his responsibilities.
What would you have done
if I hadn't come back, if I had died?
Go ahead,
Karl-Heinz, tell me...
do you want to abandon
Eva and Edmund to their fate?
I never said that.
I wish your mother
were alive.
But they took her
away from me, too.
Everything was taken away--
my money was taken by inflation...
my children were taken away
by Hitler.
I should have rebelled,
but I wasn't strong enough...
like many of my generation.
We saw disaster coming
and did nothing to stop it.
And today we suffer
the consequences...
We are paying for our mistakes.
All of us! You as well as me.
But we need to see our faults,
because complaining doesn't help.
I know,
I know it, Papa.
My days are numbered.
But you are young.
You can do a lot of good.
Show that you're a man.
Have the courage to present yourself.
Everything will be easier
for you and your family.
Eva and Edmund will be grateful,
and I will be proud of you.
My son...
you'll give me a reason to live.
You'll find work.
You'll get the Number 2 Card.
Don't fight it.
Stop living like a hunted animal.
You must go back among people.
Re-enter into the real world.
There is no shame in accepting
your own fate.
I was a soldier too, in WWI.
You talk about it
like it was child's play.
It wasn't like that.
And we too, started off strong.
We conquered half of Europe
and were entering the heart of Russia.
It seemed like nothing
could stop us.
All of a sudden,
everything changed.
First the defeat...
then the revolution.
I too cried when they
took away my stripes.
Nobody could say
I wasn't a good German.
Despite this, I can only say it now,
in these hard times--
my only hope was for the defeat
of the Third Reich.
I don't even want to think
about what would have happened.
Here, drink, Papa!
- Oh... some tea!
- See? Edmund found some.
Good boy.
It's somewhat bitter...
but it's hot.
It's good for me.
Would you like some too...
Karl-Heinz?
No, no, Papa.
I made itjust for you.
You're a very generous boy.
Thank you!
And you, too.
I'm glad I have children
like you.
I've had bad luck,
but I still have my children.
- Come in.
- Who is it?
The police are here.
They are searching every house.
My God, why?
- You must hide.
- I don't want to hide anymore.
Karl-Heinz--!
Open up! Police!
Open, police!
Hey, just a moment.
What do you want?
We need to search
the house.
Everything is legal here.
You're wasting your time.
Search every floor.
- Look, I don't have any ID.
- See about this.
- You don't have any ID?
- No.
- What did you do with it?
- I burned it.
Then come with us to the station.
Go downstairs.
Could I tell my family first?
Yes, but hurry up.
We have no time to waste.
- Who is it?
- Police.
- Does your family live here?
- No, they live in the kitchen.
Hurry up, go.
Turn on the lights!
They cut the power.
It wasn't our fault.
- Who owns this apartment?
- I do.
- Who else lives here?
- A bunch of women, Sergeant.
- Yourjob?
- Dancer.
Yes, a belly-dancer!
Here lives a former escapee
with her daughter.
And here a pregnant woman.
Her husband has been captive
for three years.
- Here I am, I'm ready.
- No, Karl-Heinz!
Stay with us.
He didn't do anything wrong.
Then he has nothing to fear.
Let's go.
Karl-Heinz!
Don't worry. Everything will be
all right, you'll see.
Mrs. Rademaker, come here!
What is it?
What's happening?
- Help, come here!
- What happened?
- Eva, what's happening?
- Come. My father--
What? What is it?
Come! My father's not moving.
I'm afraid...
I'm afraid he's dead.
The old man is dead.
There is nothing we can do.
- Calm down, Eva.
- In his condition, he couldn't last.
And Karl-Heinz
isn't even at home!
Come with me.
It's better if you don't stay here.
We need to send
for the doctor, at least.
Waste of money.
He doesn't need a doctor anymore.
Only one thing to do.
Arrange for the funeral.
- The casket will cost a fortune.
- Worst case, we'll put him in a bag!
That's terrible. When I die,
I don't want to be buried in a bag.
Don't talk nonsense!
What are you doing here?
Go back to your room!
So what are we doing?
Casket or not?
Let's forget the casket.
Let's move him as soon as possible.
Wouldn't it be better
if we put him on the balcony?
Don't touch him.
He could be contagious.
Contagious? He died of hunger.
Let's go. Let's move him.
Are you coming,
Mr. Rademaker?
- Here I am.
- Okay now, lift.
Go ahead with the candle.
Give us some light.
I'm going!
I thought he'd be heavier.
What did you expect,
with what we eat?
Be strong, Edmund.
What are you doing, Blank?
Aren't you coming?
I'm coming.
- There. It's done.
- What about with his clothes?
The mortician
will take care of it.
Those old pajamas
are worthless anyway.
But he has an undershirt,
and the socks are made of wool.
Is that true?
- Eva, I'm free!
- Karl-Heinz!
Eva, what's happened?
- Karl-Heinz, Papa's dead.
- Dead?
Papa, poor Papa!
I was thinking how happy
he would be to see me free.
You did what he wanted.
That should give you strength.
Come see him.
Poor Edmund.
- They let you go?
- Yes, now I'm free.
We've already taken care
of the funeral and the casket.
Thank you.
When will they take him?
Who knows?
In a day, a week...
- You can't stay here now.
- Where can we go?
My house. There's room enough,
for him too.
- Edmund, get your stuff.
- I'm not coming.
What are you saying?
You want to be left alone?
Why not?
I have a place to sleep.
- Who's going to look after you?
- None of your business!
Who do you think you are?
You're still a child.
Did you think of that when I was
bringing food for everyone?
Edmund!
Let him go. When he feels lonely,
he'll come back.
I told you to be careful.
Here, I'll help you.
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.
When the husband found out
Ilda was cheating on him...
you should have heard what
came out of his mouth!
- I can imagine.
- It took him a while to find out.
He knew about it,
but it was convenient.
Of course he knew.
He's been out of work for months,
- yet at his house they have food.
- Keep your hands to yourself!
- Are you ticklish?
- The little precious!
Did you forget you always
looked for me at night?
- Kristel!
- Why are you here? Go away!
- Kristel, let's go away.
- We don't want babies here.
- Go away.
- Let's get out of here.
Let me through.
Stop it. Let me through!
- Defend your boyfriend.
- I don't get involved with kids.
Mr. Enning? Mr. Enning!
Mr. Enning!
Oh, it's you.
What do you want?
- Can I talk to you?
- Of course, come up!
Come in.
I'm sorry, Mr. Enning,
but I need to talk to you.
What's happened?
Why are you so pale?
Come, dear. Sit here.
Next to me.
Good. Go on now.
Talk. What's new?
Mr. Enning,
everything is done.
Everything is done?
- I killed my father.
- You? How could you?
- Just like you told me to.
- Me?
I didn't tell you anything.
You're crazy... a monster!
Edmund! Edmund.
Edmund.
Get up, please. Speak to me.
How could you do
something like that?
Have you gone mad?
If word gets out that I--
I never told you anything.
I never said anything!
Edmund, get up.
Calm down. Stop this.
Listen to me.
We'll figure out what to do.
Believe me, I love you.
Stop this, Edmund.
Edmund...?
Edmund!
Give me the ball!
May I play with you?
No, we want to play
by ourselves.
- I can show you how to play.
- No, leave us alone.
Give me the ball.
Come on.
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go away.
Miss Rademaker?
- The truck is here.
- We need to tell the children.
I'll call them now.
We're too late.
Where is Edmund?
Where could he be?
Have you seen Edmund?
Edmund!
Edmund! Edmund!
Edmund...
My God!
THE END
