A small hamlet...
Present Thanjavur...
Lord!
My clan is getting wiped out
because of King of Pandia,
you must raise my children,
- l'm handing over him to you.
- As you order, my lord.
Oh my son!
What am l to do now?
Oh my son!
Hey Chola!
Will you dare go against me?
Challenge me?
- Hey Chola!
- Hey Pandia!
The people who challenged me
are driven out of my region...
Thanjavur 1879 AD
Period of last King of Chola dynasty
Wait till the message comes.
How many years may go past.
The Chola prince who left in exile,
reached an island
after many days of travel,
it's still a mystery about what happened
to him and where did he go.
Many Pandian Kings tried
to find the Chola prince.
Anyone who attempted was ambushed by
well laid out traps of Cholas on the way.
The dream of Pandian kings to wipe out
Cholas and regain the lost Goddess idol,
could never get fulfilled.
Yet, they never gave up
trying for it.
They passed the tale about Chola prince and
regaining the idol to next generation.
Many Archeologists tried
to locate his whereabouts.
Few returned half way and advised others
not to tread the dangerous path.
Those who went without caring
about it never returned home.
The place where that Chola prince lived
which is the dream of every archeologist,
an archeologist found it facing
umpteen dangers on the way.
Today...
Minghu Ha lsland, near Vietnam...

Acclaimed Archeologist missing!
Feared dead!

Let me see

Excuse me...excuse me...

Boys are scared, teII me,

Are you a girI?
If you're a man,

Are you here on a picnic?
Why didn't you warn about

Are you with us to have fun?
HeIIo...we are going back,

I asked you so many times about

What rights do you've

What am I to teII them?

Okay, we are Ieaving.

We came trusting you, right?
We are aIready neck deep

Think about it.
It's paining, bIoody...
Out!
All of you go out.
Down your pant.
Down your pant.
I need to give you a shot of injection.
Why? Give it on my hand.
It's powerfuI injection,

Pants down, fast,
I don't have time.
How I inject there?
Down it IittIe further.
PIease!
Turn that side.
If I give the shot in wrong pIace,

Show me.
Didn't see much, right?
No cries can bring back the dead,
sIeep peacefuIIy.
You'II feeI better.

As search gets deeper...
Heart is celebrating...

Love is stuttering...
O Siva! Ash smeared Siva...

You're the leader, chief minister,

Battle hero, young man,

Don't rub the wrong side of me...
O Siva! Ash smeared Siva...

One day is just a speck

Kill yourself to seek me...

Set up camp here.
Unload things.
Ravi, she says this pIace is
too dangerous, must Ieave at once.
What danger?
My guess is snakes.
Did you come here with us

What eIse is there?
Lions, Tigers, Monkeys...
I reaIIy got scared.
Go!
Says full of snakes,
l'm going to slap her one day.
Where did you find this mad woman?
Hey snake!
Not just one, there are many snakes.
I attacked as group
to scatter an army...
Get out!
They teased you.
I didn't Iike it.
You came to heIp me in troubIe.
That's why...
Don't feeI too much, Ieave it.
Sit down.
What are you reading?
Are you searching for peopIe
Iost 00 years ago?
Are we going to dig their pIace?
Okay, but we are aIready
facing so many probIems.
ChoIas didn't go just Iike that,
they Iaid 7 dangerous death traps,
so nobody wouId dare foIIow them.
I mean traps.
Sea, forest tribaIs, security huntsmen,
serpents, quicksand, hunger, thirst.
And a viIIage.
We've crossed three dangerous traps.
This pIace is fourth trap.
Serpents.
I mean snakes.
This oIden text on Ieaf is the
onIy hope of our escape.
It was written by a Pandian chieftain
who went after the ChoIa prince.

Take positions...hold fire.
Get down...get down...
Snake...snake...snake...
Leave me!
- Leave me...
- Go...go...go...
Run fast! Go...go...go...
jump into the water...
TeII me something
I can understand.
Snakes are better than this.
Oh God!

Let's go.
Great figure, right?
- How far have we come?
- l don't know.
You warned about serpents,
we didn't Iisten to you.
Sorry.
How to go back to that
far away pIace?
I'm scared about those snakes.
We'II proceed forward?
Do you know the way?
HeIIo! Wait!
Why are you deciding yourseIves?
Won't you ask me?
I can't come Ieaving
my peopIe behind.
AIready I'm afraid about their safety.
Let's stay tiII they come here.
We are going, you stay here.
Who asked you to stay?
I'm not taIking to you.
Excuse me...pIease don't trust her.
She'II betray you.
She's a cheap woman.
Hands off me.

RascaI!
HeIIo, show some respect, if not...
Rotten piece of shit.
You've Iit the fire,

Why are you staring at me?

Go...making empty threats.
Come on, fire at me.
- Shut up!
- You don't taIk to me.
Yuck! Shut up, you scumbag.
Why are you abusing me in EngIish?
Do you consider yourseIf

- What wiII you do? Let me see.
Shut up Anitha.
- You shut up, you bitch.

You're the biggest fucking bitch

Yeah right.
You'd rather Iet him have

Shut up, you bIoody bitch, otherwise

Oh! I'm so scared.
Go ahead, but you can't.

Why are you both speaking

You're responsibIe
for aII this, bIoody...
Magazine was fuII, right?
We've Iost many men, sir.
We need more weapons.

Not with any bad intention as you think,
you were shivering in coId...
I wanted to cover you...trust me.
Removing pant is wrong
not the shirt.
With good intention onIy...
lt'll smell bad, adjust.
You're running high fever.
There's onIy one remedy for it,
but don't mistake me if I say...
HoId me tight and sIeep.
Your body wiII warm up

Think I'm your brother.
Not a brother, think I'm your friend.
Listen to me, if you sIeep hoIding

ShaII we go back?
I can't bear this hunger.
Hey Iousy girIs! No food or water,

Don't think too much. Come!

Leave her...I'm teIIing you,

HoId her! HoId her! HoId her!
You never Iisten to me.

Big rocks turn into small stones

Don't sIeep, you may get sucked in.
Were you born Iike this or you become

Be free.
Won't your peopIe ask if you

- I don't have anyone.
- Dead?
No, father is there,

I waIked out on him.
What's the probIem?

My father didn't Iike him.
He shouted at me, I Ieft his home.
Are you Iiving with your Iover now?
Yuck! He's aIso not a worthy man.
RascaI!
He asked me to stop digging and be

He must've camped here.
He left behind so many things here,

Catch it...catch it...


From generations no change.
No food, no water.
What can people do, King?
You live in the comforts
of the palace,
has anyone told you
about difficulties we face?
No water even to clean
after passing faeces, King.
Can't hold on for long,
then don't complain about the stink.
Set up a camp, send a team
immediateIy to find those three.
Go, don't stop.
l saw tiger mascot on his back.
l fear him to be a messenger.
Are you a messenger of Cholas?
Why a tiger tattoo on your back?
I'm terribIy hungry, man.
I want mashed eggs,
I want biryani.
I haven't eaten for 10 days.
My intestines are paining.
l want water, l want biryani,
l want chicken piece and beer.
AII because of those...
No.
My mother has toId me not
to abuse women.
I wish to tie Anitha and
rape her.
Won't you cry then?
Won't you cry saying you raped me?
Why am l getting bad ideas?
So what if l get it?
Sub-conscious thoughts
are coming out.
lf Lavanya agrees,
l'll marry her...
She'll not agree.
Lousy woman!
Is he the messenger?
WiII he take us to our motherIand?
WiII it pour down heaviIy?
You've Iost your baIance, Devar.
Without dress...
...like power in it,
warmth of humans...

Hey Ieave us!
Hey! Who the heII are you?
Brother, I'm innocent,
Anitha did everything.
HeIIo! What's happening here?
Where are we?
Who are these peopIe?
ChoIas!
The ChoIas whom we came
searching here. They are ChoIas.
- You said they wouId be dead.
- We thought like that.
But they didn't perish.
They have continued to live here
for generations after generations.
I'm coming from ChoIa kingdom.
My name is Nambirattiar.
Lord Siva of South of Meru,
Protector of Thanjai,
King of the ChoIa,
Udaiyar Sri Rajendrasena's daughter.
I've taken a vow.
My wish is to make Iove
with King and achieve fame.
- Hey! Where are you taking me?
- Leave me...Anitha, no...Ieave me.

How long we have been
waiting for this day?
How many generations we have
been waging this battle?
My name is Anitha Pandian.
l belong to the royal family.
They are my ancestors.
For generation to generation,
we have only one dream,
to find the place where the
missing Chola prince lived,
and bring back
our family deity's idol.
This revenge is fed to us with mother's
milk and is part of our genes.
Like Union Minister Veerapandian,
Ex-Major Ravisekharan,
eight of us remain in that clan,
our parents raised us as royals.
Taught us many arts.
Though we live as ordinary citizens,
the revenge hasn't died down.
l didn't expect Cholas who stole
our family deity would be alive.
Good, the vow taken by
our ancestors must get fulfilled.
l must wipe out the Cholas
who enslaved Pandians.
l've only one weapon with me.
My body!
My mother has taught me
how to use it to attack.
We are well aware of
all your terror acts against us.
ln the golden swing
decorated with romance...
Can you sing, Devar?
A baIIad, free verse, a poem sung in
praise of hero by 7 different aged women.
AtIeast any one?
Okay. Can you atIeast sing medIey
of songs with the Iast word?

Where's the land with
dancing pods of paddy?
Where's the court
where my word was rule?
Where's the battlefield
where bow and arrows played?
Where's the statue chiseled
out from rocks?
Men without a motherland...
O my supreme lord!
Adorned with moon...
Revenge has brought me here...

ln search of land filled
with greenery...
Eyes got tired in that
eternal search...
Searching for the eluding
flower of prosperity...
My life has been spent...
ln search of the music of chisels
on rocks ears got melted away...
My tongue has lost it's sense
in search of a meal...
Kings of Cholas who ruled
with tiger mascot on their flag...
Now have to eat rats to survive...
Now have to live like plants
surviving on air...
Am l a king who rules
over a country of skulls?

How am l to continue?
Praising him to the hilt...
What's the message?
Where's the Ietter?
Ordered to be deIivered when aIone.
My wish is to make love
with King and achieve fame.
Message?
Let our Iegs entwine,
Iips unite, bodies merge,
eyes cIosed, sIeep together,
and I hesitatingIy...
Your eyes don't mean it.
Your touch says something different.
Your gestures mean something eIse.
Your panting chest is not good.
Nothing is right with
your womanhood.
I know your cunningness.
Your praise of the enemy
is pure chicanery.
TeII me!
Cry!
This is not bIood of a ChoIa!
This is bIood of an coward, frightened
and panic stricken wretched man.
Are you a ChoIa?
Is this your ChoIa kingdom?
Even the worst of my Thanjavur
dress better than you.
Living Iike pigs in sty roIIing over
in your own urine and faeces.
Think of my Thanjavur.
If you don't respect,
you'II not get any message.
For what you've been waiting for
1000 years, it'II not happen.
I won't teII the message
even if you torture me.
Make Iove with me,
Iet our bIood mix,
Iet your shouIder get tired
and take rest on my chest,
I'II teII you the message then.
Aren't you a king?
Your queens are sIeeping
with you onIy, right?
Or eIse are they sIeeping with
other men to satisfy their urges?

You want more?
TeII me the message.
TeII me!
Third day from now,
Iet's traveI towards ChoIa kingdom,
you'II be coronated in
ChoIa kingdom.
PeopIe of ChoIa are waiting for you.
This is the message
I have brought for you.
Is it enough?
Don't teII Iies!
TeII me the truth!
Truth! Trust me.
You'II see ChoIa kingdom
in two weeks.
Men without a motherland...
This is cry of your son...
A King's lament...
Where's the land with
dancing pods of paddy?
Where's the court
where my word was rule?
Where's the battlefield
where bow and arrows played?
Where's the statue chiseled
out from rocks?
Are you the messenger?
Is it reaIIy you?
Messenger will come, get killed,
and wipe tears of the destitute,
and it will pour down heavily,
nothing has come true,
are the paintings of
my ancestors lies?
Everything will come true,
shouldn't time be favourable?
Chola kingdom is just
gaining strength.
Trust me.
Your bad days are over.
We have established water houses
and rest homes in the way.
No need to worry or fear.
Everything will go on smoothly.

O King! Why are you hesitating?
Why don't you teII us what you know?
We know about the messenger's arrivaI,
we have been sitting tight hoIding
our breathe since Iast night.
What's the message?
Is it good news?
WiII it end our years of travaiIs
and make our dreams come true?
My peopIe!
The days of you fearing me
and I fearing you is over.
Two days from now we are traveIIing
towards our motherIand.
SiIence pIease...siIence!
Are we Ieaving for good?
Has the king become
a groom again?
The prediction was messenger
wouId bring rains.
But not a drop of rain feII.
Is it any bad omen?
My peopIe!
I have hope!
Those who trust me, can join me.
If not I'II go aIone and take you aII
after seeing our homeIand.
Don't speak Iike this and
Ieave us to die here,
we've got an opportunity which
was denied to our ancestors,
pIease forgive us,
before you point it to us,
Iet us see Thanjavur,
my heart yearns to hug
civiIised peopIe.
ShouIdn't we offer sacrifice
for our safe journey?
I'm ready to offer myseIf, King.
Why? Don't you want to
see your motherIand?
I've grown very oId.
I can't even stand on my Iegs.
I've to move aII round enjoy feasts.
I've to befriend many there.
I've to make Iove to beautifuI women.
Can I do aII this?
Come on do it.
King! WiII you reach motherIand

Hey oId man!
No seIf praise pIease.

You never toId me about it.
You thought we'II get scared of it.
Turning into water and
five basic elements as our roots...
We'll not leave till our body
disintegrates in earth...

Till we touch our motherland,

Though down and out...
We'll not die till
