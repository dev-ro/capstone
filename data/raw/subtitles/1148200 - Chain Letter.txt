We are live on the scene

in the teen murder spree.
A police detective investigating
these heinous crimes
has now gone missing.
Authorities have yet

parents need to stay close
to their teens
and keep them well guarded
till further notice.
- Good morning.
- Morning.

Life in the modern world
has a new anxiety these days.
Just as we've become dependent
on our computers,
they're now being stalked
by saboteurs.
[Man] The Federal Bureau
of Investigation can hear
everything you say even when
your cell phone's turned off.
[Man #2]
We can't control technology
because it is everywhere.
[Man #1] The Unabomber sent
a letter to the New York Times
claiming to be a member
of the Freedom Club.
[Man #3] They crashed
his computer with a virus
and used his own e-mail
to infect everyone
on his friends list.
Security experts fear
an all-out assault
on computer systems
around the globe.
They're scrambling
to come up with anti-virus--
I've had seven
different passwords,
and they got them all so far.
[Man #3]
Victims of computer fraud
are wondering, why is this
all happening to me?
[Man #4]
Now, I know you've heard that story
about the Special Ops soldiers
captured in the Middle East
and tortured because he had
a government-issued cell phone.
[Man #3]
Here's an interesting new statistic.
Three-quarters of all cell phones
now come with global positioning.
[Wallace] The terrorists
were able to track his location
just because he had it on.
Special Ops soldier
infiltrates a terrorist camp,
gets captured all because
his cell phone was tapped?
The legislation has given
the government new powers
to eavesdrop on both domestic
and international--
- We're supposed to feel safe?
- l believe
in domestic terrorism
and I think I'm being watched.
[Man #1] As targets,
we're people who contribute
to the industrial technological system.
At the stroke of midnight,
January 1, 2000,
elevators may stop,
heat may vanish.
[Man #1] Y2K hackers are ready
to attack computers all over the place.
[Man #3]
Stock markets around the world
may suffer some form of collapse.
[Wallace] What is the government
doing with all of this technology?
With all of this information?
Can we trust them with it?
Do we know that
it isn't being hacked and used
by outside forces,
possibly enemies,
people who want to kill us?

I just called the house.
Nobody picked up.
Well, what do you want me
to do about that?
- Where are your parents?
- Look, I don't know.
They went to some benefit thing.
Jessie, can I call you back, please?
l'm knee-deep in some action here.
l need to call you back.
No, no, no, listen.
Neil, wait.
Okay, just meet me at the house
as soon as you can, please?
I'm going there right now,
and I'm too scared to go alone.
So just meet me there, okay?
Please?
Okay, l'll-- I'll, uh--
Yeah, I'll be--
l'll be right there.

[Crenshaw]
Listen, l--
l really don't think
we need a profiler
on this case right now.
Yes, I am--
What's his name?
Wiggins? Fine. Fine.
Jessie, listen,
l'm really sorry
about your friend.
I, uh-- I can't imagine
what you've been going through.
[Jessie crying]
Listen, I just wanna ask you
a few questions
so we can figure out
who's doing this.
- Okay.
- Now,
what made you
rush over here tonight?
We all got these chain letters.
Um...
[sniffles]
- [chimes]
- See?
[beeps]
Who sent this?
Jessie, what's going on?
Rachael's dead.
What? She's dead?
Jessie, can you forward this
chain letter from your phone?
Mm-hmm.
l want you to send it
to this address.
And then send it to me.
- There's my e-mail.
- Are you sure?
- Don't l have to send it to four people?
- No, no.
- Because-- And the thing is--
- Don't worry about it.
l'll take care of it.
Just send it to me.
- Taylor.
- Excuse me.
I want you to call the lab.
Tell them I'm sending a chain
letter over there right now.
See if they can trace it,
or if it matches anything
we already have in the system.
Right.
Can either of you think
of anything else
that l should know about?
Drugs, uh, boyfriends, enemies?
Um,
yeah.
There was a guy she met online.
He was an older guy.
She wasn't freaking out,
but he was sending her some weird stuff.
- He was texting her all the time.
- Okay. Ever meet this guy?
No.
- All right.
- Okay.
[Crenshaw] Okay, look--
look, that's-- that's enough.
- Oh, man.
- That's enough. Listen, take her inside.
- Take her inside.
- [Jessie crying]
If you get any more chain letters
or any suspicious texts,
I want you to call me right away.
Send them to me.
This is Stephanie.
She'll take care of you.
- Jessie?
- Yeah.
[chattering]
[vehicle doors closing]
You okay, son?
No. No, l'm not okay.
- [Neil crying]
- [Crenshaw] It's all right.
lt's not-- It's not--
It's not all right.
- lt's not all right.
- Let's go, son. Let's go.
[vehicle departing]
[chattering]
I hope you've solved the mystery.
Detective Crenshaw.
l knew it was you because
your name's on the plaques.
I know who you are.
- You do?
- Wiggins. Profiler.
- Frank.
- l heard you transferred over.
How do you like it so far?
Big change from New York, huh?
Yeah, it's-- it's different,
but I'm-- I'm adjusting to it.
I've known about you
for quite a while.
- 1996, I believe it was,
- Mmm.
was the year that you broke
the Browning Brother cult.
That was pretty impressive.
Can I ask you a question,
Detective?
You can ask.
How'd you do it?
- Just instinct.
- [chuckles]
lnstincts. That's good.
So, what do your instincts
tell you about this case?
These chains are key.
Always chains,
always the same kind.
Most of them are in Evidence,
but I-- I held back a few.
Mmm.
Yeah, a little stamp on the side.
That's what you're talking about?
Whatever it is, it's the key
to cracking this case.
I profile people, not metal.
Well, somehow,
it reminds me
of a radical group
a few years back.
- Hold on, hold on.
- [snaps fingers]
Keep talking.
What was their name?
- Um...
- Something, uh...
lt was about technology,
anti-technology--
Antech.
- That's it.
- Yeah.
- Okay. That's it. Antech.
- Yeah.
They were apocalyptic
Luddites, right?
They hated computers,
the Internet...
But that was a group,
and I'm sure
that this is the work
of a single guy.
Do you remember, Detective,
the, uh, Unabomber?
Uh, Ted Kaczynski, right?
Went to Yale,
taught at Berkeley.
He was a smart guy.
He knew technology,
but he hated it.
And if a guy is so anti-tech,
why would he, uh,
send e-mails to people?
l don't know.
Why don't you tell me?
Why? Why would someone
embrace something
that they are so opposed to?
Unless it's strategy.
Fight fire with fire.
[stammering]
That doesn't make sense.
That doesn't make any sense to me.
Look, I mean, look at all the good
that technology has done.
Breakthroughs in medicine,
instant communication all over the globe.
- Detective, you don't get it, do you?
- Helps save innocent lives.
They don't like technology.
lt doesn't matter about
the result or the application.
They don't like technology.
That's it.
Please, do me a favor.
Allow me to take these photos
for a couple of days.
You know, I got one plaque
in my whole life,
and they spelled my name wrong.
Two G's, not one.
Hey, Michael, it's Jess.
l've been doing some research
on the chain letters.
Call me back when you get this.
l'm headed home now.
[beeping]
How can someone do this?
Someone's tracking us.
[beeps]
[beeping]
[line ringing]
[ringing continues]
[voices overlapping]
[Man]
Huh? Huh?
[phone ringing]
[voices overlapping continues]
Hey.
[muttering]
Hey, buddy. How you doing?
How do you think l'm doing?
- l miss her, too, Neil.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
So, uh--
[stammering]
You wanna tell me what
this meeting is about, guys?
l mean, you're not gonna stop
any of these killings, Jessie.
You send out five chain letters,
and then five pop up everywhere.
I know. I know.
Just listen to me, okay?
There's a person behind this,
and I think l know what he's doing.
- He's tracking us online.
- Tracking us how?
There's a virus that I found
in my phone and in the e-mail, okay?
The virus is a tracker.
We all have it.
That's how he knows whether
or not we pass it on.
That's fucking crazy.
How could he know where we live? How?
lt's easy, okay? Everything you have
is connected to a bill you pay, right?
And all the companies who bill you
have your addresses.
lt's not that hard.
I never even thought about that.
But why us, huh?
Why us out of everybody?
Because he's a fucking
psychopath, Michael!
Why did Jeffrey Dahmer kill people?
- Why did O.J. slash his wife?
- What are you saying?
- What do you think I'm saying?
- Guys, come on. Stop.
No. This is not
on you guys, all right?
- Who do you think got the first message?
- Who did he send it to then?
Me. He sent me
the message, all right?
I-- He said it was a game.
And I sent it to you guys.
You know how that feels?
You wanna know what that--
Fuck it. All right.
- l'll show you what that fucking feels like.
- What are you doing?
- Neil, what are you doing?
- l'm gonna show you.
I'm gonna fucking show you what it's like
to be in my fucking shoes.
What the fuck are you doing?
What are you doing?
Give me your phone.
- [beeping]
- l sent you the message.
- You got it.
- [ringing]
- [chimes]
- [muffled crying]
All right. It's fine.
You fucking shit.
[all yelling]
- Stop!
- Stop!
- You threaten my life?
- This isn't on you!
This is on me, all right?
This is on me!
Everybody's fucking dead,
and you pull a fucking gun out on us?
[phone chimes]
- Oh, fuck.
- [Michael] What?
- He fucking sent me another chain letter.
- What?
Fucking break the chain,
and you will die, man.
Man, he's watching us.
He is watching us.
Fuck you, Neil.
What are you saying? Where is he?
- He's here. He's watching us.
- We gotta do something now.
Okay, so the way this works
is you die if you delete it, right?
The chain letter said
we had 24 hours.
l don't wanna die.
l'm just gonna send the fucking message
to people that l hate, right?
l mean, if they die,
big fucking deal.
- Too bad for them.
- You're fucking tripping right now.
- Just chill out for a second.
- Hey, I sent the message to you,
didn't I?
Fuck you guys, man.
l'm fucking outta here.
So listen to me. I know how
we can pass these on, okay?
And then once it's over,
we just have to get rid of our phones
and our e-mail addresses, okay?
Whatever.
[scoffs]
What the fuck
does it matter now, huh?
[sniffles]
[computer chimes]
You've received chain mail.
Why the fuck do you keep
sending these to me, man?
I'm doing everything you want me to do.
I keep sending them on.
Fucker!
[chimes]
You've received chain mail.
What the fuck
you want me to do?
l've sent off these goddamn chain letters
to everyone l fucking know.
[stammering]
[chimes]
You've received chain mail.
Fucking relax, man.
I just gotta take...
l gotta take a deep
fucking breath.
[exhales forcefully]
l just gotta think
what I'm gonna do.
[chimes]
You've received chain mail.
Fucking Rachael.
[mutters]
[chimes]
You've received chain mail.
[sighs]
All right.
[stammering]
I gotta fucking--
- You've received chain mail.
- l gotta fucking do something.
- l gotta fucking do something.
- You've received chain mail.
He wants to fucking
play games with me.
That's what he fucking
wants to do, huh?
- [computer continues]
- You wanna fucking play games?
You wanna fucking
play games with me!
- Kill my goddamn sister!
- You've received chain mail.
- Fucking delete this.
- [beeps]
Delete your fucking message, man.
Why don't you come and get me?
Why don't you fucking
come and get me?
[grunts]
[cries out]
[grunting]
[screaming]
[screaming continues]
[yelling]
[screaming]
[phone ringing]
[gasping]
[ringing continues]
- Jessie, what's going on?
- Just forward me the chain letter.
Forward it to me,
and then change your number.
Change your e-mail address,
and never use those old accounts again.
Crenshaw has it set up so that
all the e-mails are going
to some police computer
that checks them.
I don't feel good about this.
If it doesn't work,
everything's gonna fall on you.
Just trust me, okay?
Just send it.
l'll be fine. l'll be okay.
Just send it.
[sighs]
[thunder rumbling]
[ringing]
Crenshaw.
[Mr. Bradford]
Remember that link you were looking for?
Oh, Mr. Bradford.
I remembered.
Used to be a place
out on Ramsey Road.
Wilson. Dead now.
One of his sons
went off to that war.
Used to supply chains
to the meatpacking plant.
Plant went out of business.
So did they.
[thinking]
"They brand themselves with bar codes."
Oh, my God.
[beeping]
- [line ringing]
- Come on. Pick up.
Crenshaw. Oh, shoot.
Crenshaw, l know these are our guys.
They're an old cult
that grew in the 20th century.
They call themselves
Technology Terrorists.
They were vocal until Y2K,
and when nothing happened,
they dropped out of sight.
They brand themselves
with bar codes
to demonstrate how technology
destroys individual identity.
- Oh, shoot.
- [beeps]
[clinking]
[clinking continues]
[Man yelling, distant]
[yelling continues]
[yelling grows louder]
[yelling continues]
- Who are you?
- l'm Kevin Daniels.
l'm Kevin Daniels.
Ooh, you're all gonna die.
[echoing]
Delete.
Hey, man, l wanna go home.
Okay, son.
l'll help you.
- Please! The line!
- Okay.
All right.
Where'd he go?
No. No.
I don't know where he is.
l'll get you down.
l'll help you.
[yelling]
[screaming]
- [whispers] Hello.
- [Man] Investigation.
[panting]
This is Crenshaw.
I need to speak to Wiggins now.
Crenshaw,
where have you been?
We've been trying
to reach you all day.
- Our security system's been hacked.
- What?
The guy claiming to be Wiggins yesterday
turned out to be an imposter.
You're not gonna believe this,
but the actual Wiggins
turned up deceased
less than an hour ago.
We need you back at the station.
Where are you?
lt doesn't matter about
the result or the application.
They don't like technology.
[echoing]
- [Crenshaw's voice] Antech.
- [Female's voice] They're a cult.
- They're a cult.
- [Crenshaw] What's his name?
- They're a cult.
- Wiggins?
- Fight fire with fire.
- They're a cult.
We all got these chain letters.
[Wiggins' voice]
They don't like technology.
[Female Detective]
Cult. They're a cult.
Where there is a good side
there is also a bad side.
- They're a cult. They're a cult.
- Both are out there
- ...lurking somewhere.
- They're a cult.
[grunting]
[yelling]
[thud]
[phone ringing]
[ringing continues]
[thunder rumbling]
[Crenshaw's voice]
Jessie, can you forward
this chain letter
from your phone?
l want you to send it
to this address.
And then send it to me.
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.
[phone chimes]
We can handle it.
[phone ringing]
[thud]
[line ringing]
Hey, Jessie, it's Michael.
Look, l need you to call me back
as soon as possible,
'cause l'm seriously worried
about you, all right?
I don't know if this whole
sending the chain letter things
to you was a good idea.
Just call me back as soon
as you get this, all right?
If not, l'll be there
early in the morning.
[beeps]
[thunder rumbling]
[thunder continues]
[ringing]
[ringing continues]
[gasps]
[panting]
[alarm blaring]
And we are live on the scene
at the Carlson Police Department
with a shocking new development
in the teen murder spree.
A police detective investigating
these heinous crimes
has now gone missing.
[Man] All right.
So what are you thinking?
Maybe she needs more
than a counselor.
Jessie's gonna be fine, sweetheart.
Crenshaw's gonna solve this thing.
He's the best there is.
And in the meantime,
l promise you she's safe.
[chains clinking]
[muffled panting]
[muffled whimpering]
Just forward me the chain letter.
[echoing]
Crenshaw has it set up so that
all the e-mails are going
to some police computer that tracks them.
