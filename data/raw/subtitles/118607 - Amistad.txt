1839
That one wants us
to sail them back.
That one thinks he can sail
all the way back without us.
East. To the sun!
l understand. You can trust me.
To Africa!
What?
Well, l have to tack, don't l?
You'd rather l didn't?
You want to get there?
l have to tack!
You're going to
get us killed!
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
now go take a bath.
We have to signal them.
When the ship gets
close, he'll run and hide.
Then we both start yelling.
They'll search the ship.
Get ready.
Six Weeks
Dolly!
Dolly!
Lay up, Mr Packwood!
Aye, aye, sir!
Straight ahead!
Fire over their heads!
Open the gate!
Come on, come on, come on!
Move along, now!
Move along!
- Forward! Move along!
- Keep it going!
Get along! Get moving!
- Don't stop there! Keep moving!
- Make way for the stinking heathens!
All right, move on.
Lock 'em up!
Gates! Gates! Gates!
Push 'em in!
lsabella ll, Queen of Spain
Your Royal Highness.
Something's happened.
Martin Van Buren,
8th President of the United States
The ambassador to Spain,
Senor Caldero.
- What?
- Senor Calderon.
Yes, all right. Not now.
- lt is a matter of importance, sir.
- God bless you all!
l'm trying to drink my brandy
after a very long day.
l simply wasn't certain
whether this was something you wanted
to take care of personally.
Leder, there are what, four million
Negroes in this country?
Why on earth should l concern
myself with these forty-four?
Well, there are reasons.
l don't care how.
You just take care of it.
The ship is Amistad.
lt's too small to be
a transatlantic slaver.
They're plantation slaves, then?
West lndians?
Not necessarily.
At least they certainly
don't look it.
Not from the glimpse l caught of them
on their way to jail.
They have these... scars.
- Scars?
- Yeah.
They were first detained by officers
of a brig off Long lsland.
They were conveyed to New Haven -
under what authority, l don't know -
and given over to
the local constabulary.
About forty of them,
including four or five children.
The arraignment
is day after tomorrow.
l can only assume that
the charge is murder.
l'll see what l can do about that.
Perhaps a writ for illegal arrest
and detainment to stall things.
At the very least,
make sure they have good counsel.
Chief! Chief!
He's not a chief!
Brother! Brother!
He's not your brother.
- What is he then?
- He's a white man.
Hear ye! ln the matter of the court
of the United States of America
in the year of our Lord, 1839, the
honourable Andrew T Judson presiding.
lf it please, Your Honour.
The bench recognises
District Attorney Holabird.
l would like to present
the court, Your Honour,
with the charges
of piracy and murder...
l have a petition for
a writ of habeas corpus.
l was speaking.
Mr Holabird, your charges, whatever
they might be, will be rendered moot.
That petition, Mr Tappan
- if that's what it is - is moot,
until an actual writ by some higher
court, by some miracle, is granted.
- Mr Holabird is correct.
- And if you would, sir,
please kindly refrain from
impersonating a lawyer,
which you patently are not.
- As l was saying, Your Honour...
- Your Honour.
Mr Secretary.
Your Honour, l am here on behalf of
the President of the United States,
representing the claims of
Queen lsabella of Spain,
as concerns our mutual treaty
on the high seas of 1795.
- You have my attention.
- Thank you.
These slaves, Your Honour,
are the property of Spain,
and as such, under Article 9 of said
treaty, are to be returned posthaste.
Said treaty taking precedence
over all other claims...
Them slaves belong to me
and my mate, Your Majesty.
- Your Honour, l...
- Who be you two gentlemen?
"We, Thomas R Gedney
and Richard W Meade,
"whilst commissioned
US Naval officers,
"stand before this court
as private citizens,
"and do hereby claim salvage
on the high seas
"of the Spanish ship La Amistad
and all her cargo."
- Here you go, sir.
- Your Honour...
You wish to make this claim above
that of the Queen of Spain?
Where was she, pray,
when we was fightin' the winds,
Your Excellen... honour.
Her Majesty, the Queen of Spain,
was busy ruling a country.
Your Honour, these officers
claims are just...
Your Honour!
Here are the true owners
of these slaves.
- Order!
- On their behalf...
l am in possession of
a receipt for purchase
executed in Havana, Cuba,
June 26, 1839,
l do hereby call upon this court
to immediately surrender...
these goods!
And that ship out there
to my clients,
- Jose Ruiz...
- Yo soy Ruiz.
"Yoso" Ruiz, and Pedro Montes?
Pedro Montes.
Mr Tappan. How do you do, sir?
My name is Roger S Baldwin,
attorney-at-law.
Real estate?
Real estate, inventories
and other assets.
- Can l help you with something?
- What is it that you do?
Well, l own various business...
and banks.
As a matter of fact, you probably
could help me, Mr Tappan.
But that's not why l'm here.
l'd like to help you.
- Me?
- Yes. l deal with property.
Sometimes l get people's
property back,
other times l get it taken away,
as in this case.
Every one of the claims speaks
to the issue of ownership.
- Thank you, Mr... mr Baldwin.
- Baldwin, Roger S, attorney-at-law.
But l'm afraid what's
needed here is a criminal attorney.
A trial lawyer.
But thanks for your interest.
Yes. Well...
lntending no disrespect, Mr Tappan,
but if that were the way to go,
well, then...
Well, l wouldn't have bothered
coming down here.
Goodbye. l bid you gentlemen
a good afternoon.
ln closing...
l call upon our distinguished
colleague from Massachusetts,
Representative John Quincy Adams
to reweigh his unmeet
and unprecedented attempt
to convert this eccentric
bequest of - let's be frank -
a bunch of junk of
one James Smithson,
into a so-called institute
of national treasure!
Perhaps Mr Adams is meditating
on his response.
Had l thought your remarks worthy
of riposte, Representative Pinckney,
be assured you'd have heard
from me... hours ago!
- Who?
- Mr Tappan. Lewis Tappan.
Yeah?
l must see him?
l'm required to see him?
No, sir. He requests an audience.
Give me your hand.
Oh, he requests, does he?
Yeah. l don't know
anyone called Tappan.
- Sir, you do. You've met him often.
- Where?
- Where is he?
- He's right over there, sir.
What is that?
- Where?
- Right there, sir.
Lewis! Good to see you again!
And you, sir.
- This is Theodore Joadson.
- How do you do, sir?
- An honour to meet you, sir.
- Yeah.
- Sir? ls there somewhere...
- Let's stroll in the garden...
- Yes.
- What?
Let go of my arm. Over here.
This case has
great significance.
Our secretary of state
is paying it his attention.
You don't have to shout!
He supports the Queen's
claim that she owns the Africans.
- Two sailors are making claims.
- What season is it?
- Pardon?
- l said, what season is it?
l don't understand what you mean.
There are two ways of knowing
without consulting a calendar.
The leaves on the maple trees
have all gone,
and the fact that the President is
not at home on Pennsylvania Avenue.
Tell me, sir...
Do you really think Van Buren
cares about the whims
of an 11-year-old girl
who wears a tiara?
l assure you, only one thing occupies
his thoughts this time of the year,
being all things to all people,
which means nothing to no one.
ln other words,
gettin' himself re-elected.
Give me a hand.
- Will you help us, sir?
- Let go of my arm.
Take my stick.
- Mr Adams?
- Yeah, what?
As an advocate for the abolition
of slavery, will you help us?
l'm neither friend nor foe to the
abolitionist cause. l won't help you.
Sir.
- What?
- l know you, Mr President.
l know you and your presidency as
well as any man, and your father's.
You were a child at his side
when he helped invent America.
You, in turn, have devoted your life
to refining that noble invention.
There remains but one task undone.
One vital task the Founding
Fathers left to their sons,
before their 13 colonies could
precisely be called United States.
And that task, sir, as you
well know, is crushing slavery.
Your record confirms you're an
abolitionist, sir, even if you won't.
- And whether or not you admit it...
- Mr Joadson.
you belong with us.
You're quite the scholar,
Mr Joadson, aren't ya?
Quite the historian.
Let me tell you about
that quality, if l might.
Without an accompanying mastery of at
least one-tenth its measure of grace,
such erudition is worthless, sir.
Now, you take it from one who knows.
lf you gentlemen will excuse me.
- We know we aimed high asking you...
- Well, aim lower!
Find yourselves someone
whose inspiration blossoms
the more you lose.
lf the court awards them to Spain,
they'll be taken to Cuba
and executed.
lf the two lieutenants prevail,
they'll likely to sell them to Spain,
and they'll be executed.
lf Montes and Ruiz are successful...
l'm a little confused.
What are they worth to you?
We're discussing the case,
not its expense.
Of course. Well, the case is much
simpler than you think, Mr Tappan.
lt's like anything - land,
livestock, heirlooms, what have you.
Livestock.
Yes. Consider -
the only way one may sell or purchase
slaves is if they are born slaves,
as on the plantation.
- l'm right, aren't l?
- Yes.
- So, are they?
- "Are they?"
Yes. Born slaves,
as on a plantation.
We're not certain,
but we very much doubt it.
Let's say they are.
Then they are possessions,
and no more deserving of
a criminal trial than a bookcase.
On the other hand,
let's say they aren't slaves,
in which case they were
illegally acquired.
Forget mutiny, forget piracy,
forget murder.
Those are irrelevant occurrences.
lgnore everything but
the pre-eminent issue at hand.
The wrongful transfer
of stolen goods.
Either way, we win.
Sir, this war must be waged on
the battlefield of righteousness.
The what?
lt would be against
everything l stand for
to let this deteriorate into
an exercise in legal minutia.
Mr Tappan, l'm talking about
the heart of the matter.
As am l.
lt is our destiny,
as abolitionists and as Christians,
to save these people.
These are people, Mr Baldwin,
not livestock.
Did Christ hire a lawyer
to get him off on technicalities?
He went to the cross, nobly.
You know why?
To make a statement.
To make a statement, as must we.
But Christ lost.
- You, l think...
- No, sir, he did not.
- You want to win, don't you?
- Yes.
l certainly do. Hell, sometimes
l don't get paid unless l do.
Which brings us back to
the question of worth.
ln order to do a better job
than the Son of God's attorney
l'll require two and a
half dollars a day.
Who are they, do you think?
Looks like they're going to be sick.
Amazing grace
How sweet the sound...
They're entertainers!
- that saved a wretch like me...
- But why do they look so miserable?
l once was lost
But now am found...
You don't belong here.
Your table doesn't belong here.
This is Temne land.
How do you do, sir?
How do you do?
You want to sit?
Sit here in Mendeland.
What are you doing, Temne?
You want trouble?
Cross into our territory again.
What is this?
Get this table out of here!
Let me show you to Sherbroland.
There?
l'm sorry. l don't understand.
Excuse me. l...
My name is Roger Baldwin.
This is Theodore Joadson
of the Antislavery Society
and owner of the Forten
Shipping Service.
And this is Professor Gibbs,
a linguist.
What do you want?
Keep talking. Get them to talk.
Have you seen this before?
l could kill you with my bare
hands before you raise that sword.
This belongs to you?
No.
l need to know where you're from.
What did he say?
l didn't understand a word.
lt's gibberish.
He said, l think,
"Show me the map."
Do you think
he's here to help us?
l don't know.
He reminds me of that Fula of Baoma.
The one who hires himself out to
scrape elephant dung from the crops.
A dung-scraper might be just the kind
of man we need right now.
Here, Africa...
ls this where you're from?
A-fri-ca.
What does he want?
- He's an idiot.
- Were you born in the West lndies?
Were you born in the West lndies?
All three of them are idiots.
What did he say?
He said...
They have to go away.
Emancipation! lt's God's way!
You cannot own another human being!
- Killers of white men!
- Slavery is tyranny!
lt's those miserable-looking
people again.
God's blessing on you this morning.
l'm not afraid of you,
or your medicine!
Yes. You place your hand on
this book and l'll pray for you.
They're human beings, not animals!
Slavery will kill this country!
...in the quietude of the night
after the Spaniards attended their
vespers and were in virtuous sleep,
the savages broke loose
their collars,
and stole onto the deck
like creatures of prey.
They fell upon the unsuspecting crew
with these sabres and cane knives...
l cannot overstate...
Have you figured out who he is?
An advisor of some kind.
Perhaps theirs.
...they mutilated at least one...
- What about him?
- The simple cook, a Creole...
- Their own kind.
- Theirs maybe.
But for Senors Ruiz and Montes,
who steered the Amistad
to these shores
under constant threat of like fate,
we might never have heard of
this massacre, this bloodbath.
But for their bravery, these villains
would have escaped justice.
But they've not. They've not.
And Dung-Scraper?
l have a horrible feeling
he talks for us.
Do you know the difference
between a cow and a cabbage?
A brick and a bear?
Or how about...
a polecat and a president?
The Spanish government hopes you
don't have much more sense than that.
This case isn't about murder,
mayhem or massacres.
lt's not about anything
that dramatic.
This case is about knowing the
difference between here and there.
l want to show you something.
Open your mouth.
He doesn't understand.
He doesn't speak English.
Abra su boca.
Doesn't he understand? l thought
he was born on a Cuban plantation?
Perhaps he simply doesn't like you.
He wouldn't be the first,
Mr Holabird.
Yes.
What, did he learn this on some Cuban
plantation, this decorative effect?
Cuban plantation!
Stand up. Stand up!
Levantate.
Levantate.
Levantate.
Stand up.
Thank you.
Your Honour, l speak more Spanish,
and l was born in Philadelphia.
On Spanish plantations,
slaves choose to live
surrounded by their own ways
and simple languages.
Pray tell, what need they know
of Spanish?"Fetch? Carry? Stop?"
Gestures suffice for slaves,
as for any other beast of burden.
Your Honour...
l represent the interests
of Senors Ruiz and Montes.
- l remember.
- l have a bill of sale,
issued in Havana
for the purchase of slaves.
l remember that too.
On it, in addition to the amounts
paid for each, are their names.
Jose, Bernardo...
Paco and so on.
On behalf of my clients, l submit
this document to the court.
Mr Baldwin, you've proffered
a good deal of - l'll be kind -
circumstantial evidence.
Have you, in addition, anything, in
the order of actual documentation,
that might refute this one,
and so more compellingly
support your claims?
l'm sure l could manufacture some
as easily as they have, Your Honour.
What you're saying is,
then, you don't.
ls that correct?
l have them.
l'm afraid that does not impress me.
l thought you did quite well.
You do?
Much better than l expected,
to be honest.
Well, thank you, l think.
Although, l was concerned that
you might have forgotten
- this is just a case like any other.
- You needn't worry about that.
That's good.
Hello, Cinque.
My name is Roger Baldwin.
l'll be your attorney.
Yes. Thank you.
All right.
l need to prove where you're from.
You want
to show them where we're from.
How are you supposed to tell me?
How can l explain
to you where we're from?
- You go.
- l'm sorry, you talk first.
Here. This is where l'm from.
Here. This.
All of this. All of this is...
- is... my home.
- That's here.
Here.
Cuba. Cuba's an island.
The Amistad. This is where...
where you...
where everyone... was killed.
Here. Cuba, the Amistad.
Now, Cuba... ls this your home?
l don't think so.
But... excuse me.
Now...
Africa.
This is your home, isn't it?
This... is... your home.
Yes?
You came...
all the way...
from... here.
This... is how far l've come.
Secure the ballast, transport!
Put your backs into it, boys.
This is a court order granting us
permission to search this vessel.
- What did they want?
- To come aboard.
l informed them they needed to obtain
one of these... an authentic one.
Aren't you coming?
My light! Light...
Light the lamp, Mr Baldwin.
l'm trying.
Mr Joadson!
Here.
Are you all right?
Yes.
These papers - and l shall
ask you to examine them -
are portions of a ship's manifest l
retrieved from the Amistad yesterday.
At first glance, they may appear
to bolster the prosecution's case.
You see, they list cargo.
Cargo bearing the very Spanish names
Messrs Ruiz and Montes
insist represent my clients,
hand-scrawled in the margins.
But no, this is not the manifest
of the Amistad at all. Look.
This is part of the cargo manifest
of a Portuguese vessel,
the notorious transatlantic
slave ship the Tecora.
The Tecora.
l can bring you as many witnesses
as you wish, Mr Holabird...
Tecora!
Their clients trade primarily off
the coast of West Africa.
The lvory Coast, Sierra Leone.
l know what you're thinking.
Sierra Leone is a protectorate
of the British Crown.
Slavery is outlawed there.
lts principal port, in fact,
has been rechristened "Freetown".
How, then, can the
Portuguese Tecora...
engage in the slave trades
in these waters?
l'll tell you how. ln a word...
lllegally.
Whatever these men say
clearly matters not
because this proves them liars.
My clients' journey
did not begin in Havana,
as they keep claiming more
and more emphatically.
No, my clients' journey...
began much, much further away.
l underestimated you, sir!
l really did!
- l should take that as a compliment.
- You should indeed, sir.
l can't imagine there's no not
reaching a favourable conclusion...
Am l bleeding?
There's nothing there.
What did l do to deserve this?
You took the case, Mr Baldwin.
You took the case, sir.
l should take that as a compliment.
"As you may perceive,
"l wish you to act promptly
"before this matter becomes
a weight on our two countries."
"Great countries."
"Our great countries.
"After all, the business of
great countries is to do business."
Excelente, Su Alteza.
"Slavery is our pillar of
commerce in the New World.
"Without it, our goodwill
and excellent trade relations sh..."
- "Should be imperilled."
- "Should be imperilled.
"Without it, we might
have been denied the glory
"of aiding you in your rebellion
against the British.
"As slave-owning nations,
we must together stand firm.
"Speak the words of humaneness
for the masses of your citizens,
"but hold tightly to the power
that protects them.
"That power, of course,
is their wealth.
"The Africans must never go free.
"With sincerest admiration,
"lsabella the Second,
Queen of all of Spain."
l am not about to bend to the will
of some pubescent queen.
Forget about them.
They're unimportant.
- Prepubescent.
- You need to concern yourself
with what this matter means here,
not an ocean away.
Someone should tell me what it means!
Leder, you yourself
said it was meaningless.
Well, not any more.
- John Calhoun paid me a visit.
- Oh, God.
To explain to me why this case
is of much greater import...
much greater symbolism, to use his
word - to the South than the North.
lf the Africans are executed,
the abolitionists will
make good use of it.
And yes, they will make
some converts.
lf, on the other hand,
they are freed,
Calhoun says the Southern states
will so ally themselves against you
that you can forget
about re-election.
- Over this?
- lt's worse than that.
Worse? What could be
worse than that?
Calhoun believes, and l am not sure
l can disagree with him,
that this could take us all
one long step closer to civil war.
- This?
- Yes, Mr President.
But all is not lost.
The jury appears likely to free them,
but juries can be dismissed.
They can?
But l believe we must go further
and remove the judge.
We can do that?
He could be prevailed upon to recuse
himself for any number of reasons.
With that in mind,
l've taken the liberty of
exploring possible replacements.
l've found one l strongly
believe to be better.
He's young, which means he has a
career before him rather than behind,
he has yet to feel the hankering
for magnanimous last gestures
for the sake of posterity.
And he is monumentally insecure,
particularly about
his Catholic heritage.
- He's Catholic?
- His grandfather was Catholic,
which young Mr Coglin has striven
all his days to keep quiet.
Mr President, Judge Coglin.
Judge Coglin,
we are so pleased to meet you.
Thank you so much for coming.
l've been reading in the papers
the continuing saga
of the Amistad.
Real papers.
Real papers. Yes, sir.
Yes. Bad luck,
this last unfolding chapter.
What to do now, eh?
Which is why l came here
and imposed on you, sir.
No imposition... really.
Yeah.
How did that...
How did that young lawyer
take the news?
Oh, in stride, sir. ln stride.
The thing is, sir,
he did everything right.
- He proved the case.
- Did he?
Oh, yes, sir. Surprisingly, he did.
Good.
Well, he'll just have
to do it again, then.
But like most things, it should
be easier second time around.
Well, l'm afraid it doesn't matter
what he does now, sir.
Rumour has it our next judge
was handpicked by Van Buren himself.
No!
l'm embarrassed to admit that
l was under the misconception
that our executive
and judicial branches were separate.
No more so than these, Mr Joadson.
No more so than these.
- So now you know.
- Yes.
- Sir?
- Yeah?
Mr President, if it was you
handling the case...
Well, it isn't me.
And thank God for that.
But if it was, sir,
What would you do?
Well, when l was an attorney,
a long time ago, young man,
l realised
after much trial and error,
that in a courtroom,
whoever tells
the best story wins.
ln unlawyer-like fashion, l give you
that scrap of wisdom free of charge.
l'm much obliged
for your time, sir.
What is their story,
by the way?
- Sir?
- What is their story?
Why, they're...
from West Africa.
No. What is their story?
Mr Joadson, you're
from where originally?
Why, Georgia, sir.
- Georgia.
- Yes, sir.
Does that sum up what you are?
A Georgian? ls that your story?
No. You're an ex-slave,
who's devoted his life
to the abolition of slavery,
and overcoming great hardships
along the way, l should imagine.
That's your story, isn't it?
You and this young so-called lawyer
have proven you know what they are.
They're Africans. Congratulations.
What you don't know, and haven't
bothered in the least to discover,
is who they are.
Right?
Seven.
Eight.
Number nine...
and ten.
Now, how about you, Mr Baldwin?
Would you like to count
from one to ten?
One to ten in Mende.
- One.
- Ta.
- Two.
- Fele.
- Three.
- Sawa.
- Four.
- Nanee.
Right. Five.
Lorlu.
Fresh fruit!
Straight from the Caribbean!
- What's happened here?
- One of them died last night.
We tried to take the body
away to bury it.
What do they want?
They want to live with it?
They want to bury him.
They have to bury him
according to their poro beliefs.
Otherwise, his soul
will haunt them.
The house of Thine abode
With His own precious son...
The house of Thine abode
The church of
blessed redeemers...
lf l were you, if l ran this place,
l'd set protocol aside just
this once and let them bury him.
l love Thy kingdom, Lord...
l was thinking the same thing.
My name is Kai Nyagua...
and James Covey.
l speak Mende and English,
his language.
You and he will talk
to each other through me.
- The clothes?
- And the names.
l was rescued off a slave ship
by the British Navy.
l never went back.
A problem has arisen.
The judge we had,
who believed, l believe,
that you should be freed,
has been dismissed.
A new judge has been called upon
to hear the case,
this time without a jury.
How is that possible?
A chief cannot be replaced.
l can't explain it in any way
that you would understand, Cinque.
Or me, for that matter.
Only that, well, it has happened.
l am not a great orator
or advisor, Cinque.
l'm not a big man in my profession.
l don't know if l alone can convince
this next judge to set you free.
l need your help.
When we go to court,
l need you to speak.
l'm not
an advisor of any kind.
l cannot speak for the others.
Cinque, the others, they say you can.
They say you're the big man here.
l am not.
What's this l hear about a lion?
They say you alone - alone, Cinque -
slew the most terrifying beast
anyone has ever seen.
ls it not true?
lt had killed several people.
Even hunters among us.
Everyone including me was afraid.
l was lying down with my family,
when out of nowhere it appeared.
As it came for me
l picked up this big rock
and l threw it.
And by some miracle,
you see, l hit it.
He don't know how
that killed it, but it did.
A rock.
A rock.
l received the gratitude
of everyone in the village.
l was given respect.
They treated me
as if l was a prince.
They gave me
the fine country cloth.
All these things they gave me,
l took them all.
But l knew
l didn't deserve it.
For when l threw that rock at
that beast... if l had missed him...
He said he wouldn't be here
trying to explain these things.
He'd just be dead.
Understand?
Understand?
l'm not a big man.
Just a lucky one.
l might agree with you, Cinque,
except you're forgetting something.
The other lion.
The Amistad, Cinque.
The insurrection.
That too was an accident?
l hardly think so.
That wasn't bravery.
Any man would do the same
to get back to his family.
You yourself would do it.
Someone said that might be yours.
'My wife gave it to me.'
'To keep me safe.'
Cinque...
l need you to tell me
how you got here.
l'll hit you in the head again
if you talk.
l'll share the profit
of my harvest. l'll...
