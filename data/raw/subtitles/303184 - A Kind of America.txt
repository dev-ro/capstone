Thank you.
Good morning.
Not muesli again?
l thought you liked it?
l do, but we could
have omelet sometimes.
So much for organic food.
What's the time?
7:45
Bloody hell!
Why didn't you wake me up?
You know we're filming.
l'm supposed to be there by 8:00.
l didn't have the heart to...
Great!
Thirty people waiting for me,
and you know l hate being late.
You're the director,
they'll wait for you.
lf Timi's in it, you won't
start before ten anyway.
Why aren't these in the oven?
Leave me alone.
- Don't get cheeky with me!
- Why do you have to shout?
Because you're scribbling again.
l've had enough, you're fired!
And don't come back.
What about my wages?
l'll stuff them down your throat.
l'm entitled...
Here are your wages!
l'm paying you in kind.
One day you'll bake your
last loaf in the oven of hell,
asshole!
Who's there?
lt's almost 9:00.
Oh, hell. l'll be there
in twenty minutes.
- She just woke up.
- l'll kill her.
- Stunning.
How's this?
lsn't this good for you?
No, it's great, but l have to
get dressed or l'll be late.
Couldn't you hurry up a bit?
There's a difference between
hurrying and rushing things.
Okay then, l'm off.
Oh. Good morning Mrs Terka!
Well?
Sexualizing at
this time of day?
Goodbye!
Can l have lift?
- Where to?
- You?
Budapest.
Do l look okay?
- Stunning.
- Really? - No.
Aw, you're not angry, are you?
- At you? How could l be?
- Of course you couldn't.
Anyway, you were
late too. l heard.
Get on stage.
You've got a massage.
This is a rehearsal.
Lip-sync music!
Go!
Ákos! l got you out of the
1 0:00 meeting by saying you
were negotiating with retailers
all day and probably...
- Coffee...
- Coffee.
- ...you were exhausted.
- Lívia.
- You've been tidying again.
- Just a little.
An itty bitty little bit.
Cleanliness. Order. Pedantry!
Fuck you.
You'd have got soaked
if l hadn't picked you up.
Maybe.
Shall we go on,
or have a break?
Come on guys, keep it together!
The interim report shows
that we exceeded our
targets in the first half,
because investments
were realized faster than
our research had indicated.
Our new molding technology
has proven successful,
but we can't rest
on our laurels,
in view of the successful market
gains of our competitors,
which naturally also affects
our own market share.
But, regarding the next steps:
let's hear what Ákos has to say.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Let's stop for a bite.
l've looked forward to a real
Hungarian sausage for 1 7 years.
You used to get them fried at
the butcher's, with bread.
They burst when
you bit into them,
so you had to cut them
up with a penknife.
Can you still get fried
sausage at the butcher's?
l don't know.
We eat at McDonald's.
FROM : TAMÁS. l'VE GOT
BlG NEWS. CALL M E.
BLUE M ONKEY RESTAURANT
America needs some fresh blood.
They've got soft and stupid.
The whole country
works by internet.
They eat gene-manipulated food,
children shoot each other.
l'll try my luck in Budapest.
Me too.
Will l be able to stand this?
You get used to it after a while.
How long?
Depends on you.
lsn't it hot in there?
Yes, it is.
- ls this fur? l'm allergic.
- You can't afford to be.
- Pays well?
- Has until now.
How long have you
been doing this?
Two days. You have to
dance right through the shift.
The owner lives across the
street, and keeps an eye out.
Will you show me what to do?
No way. l've got to study.
Shower before work. That's
my skin you're putting on.
Any infectious diseases?
Depression?
l've already had it. Ciao!
Bye.
Do you understand what
this means, honey bun?
Your man is going
to direct a film.
A real, wide-screen movie,
with real actors, characters,
a beginning, middle and end.
But what about the money?
He says he'll only pay half.
l knew it. Can't you at least
pretend to be happy for me?
l am. l just worry about you.
Well don't.
l know what l'm doing.
Tamás, you've only directed
adverts and music videos.
l'm fed up of being mucked
around by 20-year-old yuppies,
and pretending to like it.
So now you'll have this
American to put up with.
Right. l'll make your lunch.
Where are you going? Hollywood?
Somewhere l'm appreciated.
Where's that kid?
Does he know where we are?
l left a message on his pager.
How is he these days?
A few weeks ago he was
going to be a baker.
András is a true misfit.
He'll either be a nobody
or somebody really famous.
Just like you!
- Has the American called?
- Not yet.
- ls he in Budapest?
- Yes.
- Call him.
- Can't do it.
- Your scared.
- Don't have his number.
And he's bringing all this
dough from America,
just to spend on your film,
``Giddy City''.
Guilty! Fuck it. ``Guilty City.''
lt's the only film l wrote.
Can't you even
remember the title?
- Doesn't matter.
- Yes it does.
And he thinks you're
putting up half the money.
What'll happen when he
finds out you're totally broke?
Did you find the place easily?
No problem.
Remember this place?
This is where we celebrated
your high-school graduation.
Right, what do you want?
Do l get a few more bucks for
signing another bogus invoice?
Your big brother
will be a director.
He is already, isn't he?
- A real movie this time.
- Of course, ``Giddy City''.
Guilty City. But whatever.
Hey, l haven't seen that
masterpiece here before.
Your favorite subject.
Tell me, have you
been layed this week?
This month? This year?
Leave him be. Your hormones are
flowing out of your ears again.
Oh, you saint!
Not everyone's a
pussy-addict like you.
Don't say to aren't playing
around with those model babes?
What makes you think
your behavior is the norm?
Are you telling me off?
Can l bring you something?
You already have.
Anything else?
Can you improve on that?
Can l bring you something?
Can l ask you something?
That's what l'm waiting for.
- Call me Ákos.
- Three beers, Ákos?
Would you like to work for me?
l'm sure you're talented.
- You must have a huge... lQ.
- Three beers, then?
Write down your phone number.
l'll be in touch.
Three beers.
We're looking forward to them.
So, why this family reunion?
- My film.
- ln other words: money.
So where do l come in?
l need both your help. The
Guy's coming from England today.
So is he English or American?
He's American, but he's
coming from London by car.
He's making several films
in Europe at the same time.
So he's traveling around.
So how can we help?
He's here for a week.
We'll take him partying,
show him the
sights, lick his ass.
We never spend any
time together anyway.
lf l take him partying,
you'll never start filming.
l'll take him partying.
- That's not the problem.
- So what is?
Time.
Tamás is supposed to
put up half the money.
Oh God.
That's him.
Don't shit yourself.
Want me to speak?
Shut up...
Let's go. He's waiting
for us in the Art Hotel.
Oh my God! l'll stink of beer.
You're not on a date,
just going to swindle someone.
Want some chewing gum?
lt's an American habit...
Hey, sweetie!
The bill.
Has Alexander Brubeck arrived?
Not yet.
We'll wait in the lobby then.
lf you really must.
l heard you became a baker.
l've changed job.
To what?
Entertainment, catering,
that sort of thing...
You opening a casino?
Not yet, but soon.
Yeah, as soon as your
lottery system starts working.
Go on, laugh.
Jupiter's in my ascendant.
Doesn't that hurt?
lt means that sooner or
later l'll strike lucky.
Probably later in your case.
That's him.
That's exactly what a
producer looks like.
Well?
l think he meant the next lift.
lt carries three.
There are five of us.
You don't count.
Then there's still four of you.
You'll all die.
Keep your mouth shut.
Your breath smells of beer.
lt stinks in here anyway.
l could make it even worse
by grabbing his balls...
They're close to hand.
l can't believe this.
So l can't even belch?
lnwardly and silently.
Then l'll fart.
l didn't really have to fart.
Fuck it.
l might as well sit down.
Relax, kiddo.
He understands that. ldiot!
What, shouldn't l say ``kiddo''?
See? He knows the title.
And it's going to
cost him a fortune.
Let's go.
He's had enough of us,
and he needs a shower.
He smells a bit cheesy.
Hey! What about
sending him a chick?
A good screw might
straighten him out a bit...
Cut it out.
Only trying to help.
Well, they could have
given it a bit more thought.
l can't believe it.
Can l fart now?
l'm not taking you
anywhere ever again.
Why not? l think he liked me.
Yeah. His life would
be so empty without us.
l'll come to the shoot tomorrow.
l'll butter him up
while you're working.
No solo missions, okay?!
Okay, but l can still
check up on my girlfriend.
Timi'll be thrilled.
Not to mention me.
Don't go easy on her
just because she's mine...
Don't worry about the money.
Let me sleep on it,
and l'll figure something out.
l know how much
''Guilty City'' means to you.
See? l know the title too.
Good evening.
But l still think ``Giddy City''
would be better.
Come on. l'll give you a lift.
No thanks. l've still
got some things to do.
DELETE DOCUM ENT:
``GUlLTY ClTY''?
DOCUM ENT DELETED
Can't you sleep?
l had a nightmare.
Why aren't you asleep?
You know l can't sleep
if you can't.
l'm so glad you stayed.
l nearly didn't.
You creep.
So why did you stay?
Because you love me.
Because l don't have a key.
So either l lock you out,
or leave the door open,
for the burglars.
You beast.
You're the beast.
- Come here.
- You come here.
Do you want to be a big
spoon or a little spoon?
Little spoon.
You let me sleep in again!
And you know how
important today is for me.
lf l wake you, you say you feel
like a sack of shit all day.
l can't stand the way you have
an explanation for everything,
so you're always in the right.
- l am in the right.
- No you're not.
Of course l am.
lf you can't stand me,
why do you stay with me?
No idea.
Why not pick up one of those
little whores from the shoot?
They're younger, prettier,
and happy to lick your ass to
appear in some advert
or one of your crap videos.
That'll happen in the end,
wait and see.
l can't wait!
My videos aren't crap.
l've always loved
speed and danger,
but they always made
me sweat profusely.
Since l started using Ambadeo,
nothing's impossible.
- Cut.
- Stop rolling.
That's terrible.
l'm not paying for that.
We're not finished yet.
lt should be much
more authentic.
l want to feel the speed,
a love of the product,
the magic of the brand...
Be patient, she'll
freeze if tell her off.
Okay, that was better.
Try to be even more convincing.
Show how super you feel.
Come on!
Quiet please!
Let's take it from the top.
Camera... Go!
l've always loved
speed and danger,
but they always made
me sweat profusely.
Since l started using Ambadeo,
nothing's impossible.
No good. Relax!
l've always loved
speed and danger,
but they all... alright... al...
always made me...
Why can't l remember this shit.
l spent all night learning it.
Can l have a smoke?
Only tobacco.
Stop rolling.
Listen up, please.
l'd like to introduce Alex
Brubeck, American producer.
With any luck we'll be
working together soon.
Be very nice to him,
it's important to me.
Cigarette break over.
Timi, take your position.
Cigarette break over
Timi, take your position.
Timi, stay cool for
a couple of minutes, okay?
Just concentrate on that
one simple sentence.
Say it like you're buying
spam in the supermarket.
l don't go shopping.
Mrs Terka does it.
Well the beautician,
or the solarium.
l don't give a shit, sweetie.
Since l started using Ambedeo,
nothing's impossible.
Get it?
Of course. Keep your hair on.
So let's try.
Okay, let's take
it from the top.
l've always loved
speed and danger,
but they always made
me sweat profusely.
Since l started using Ambadeo,
nothing's...
Cut. You're all tense.
What am l going to do with you?
Stop rolling.
Lacika!
A tonic, American recipe.
Down it in one.
You could have
thought of that earlier.
- Jocó
- Yeah?
How are you going to look
like Timi with that body?
Easy, Géza. Only my head
will show, in profile.
Fine.
lntellectually,
you're very similar.
You're asking for it.
He's only kidding,
leave him alone.
Let's do it now,
or l'll sing the words.
Okay, let's take
it from the top.
Quiet please!
Camera... Go!
l've always loved
speed and danger,
but they often made
me sweat profusely.
Since l started using Ambadeo,
nothing's impossible.
That's a wrap.
lf we got that, we
can do the next scene.
Hopefully the
stuntman's in make-up.
Ákos has been promising
me a car for months.
The producer sees red when
l hand in my taxi receipts.
lt wouldn't ruin your marriage
to take a bus, like us proles.
l wish l had one to ruin.
l don't want to end up a spinster.
You? Me, more likely.
That hair suits you.
l keep telling him,
but he doesn't believe me.
lt's bloody hot, this...
You have to suffer
for your beauty!
Do you need me any more?
l'd like to get
something to eat.
Go ahead.
lt'll take a while to make
a woman out of Jocó.
Ah! Hello everyone.
Nobody doing
anything, as usual.
That wasn't exactly
what l asked. Where's Timi?
He was just talking about her.
She's in make-up, l think.
You'd better stop that if
you want to keep your face.
Hey Barbie, can't you
take a compliment?
- Get the hell out of here!
- Hey, did l bite too hard?
Hey boys, what's
all this rough stuff?
Let me introduce you.
Ákos, Jocó.
Jocó, Ákos.
l'm Géza.
Where's Timi.
She just went for a quick...
...bite to eat.
You're lovely.
Maybe l'll switch.
l'll be right here.
You? Here?
You didn't say you were coming.
- l came to see Tamás.
- l won't bother you then.
Stay, you silly thing.
Of course l came to see you.
l can't stand an hour without you.
Then marry me.
You still here?
Do you know each other?
Only in passing, but better
late than never, eh Jocó?
l want double danger money
because of your brother.
What have you done this time?
Entertain our American guest,
but watch out,
l'm keeping an eye on you.
A good brother
helps any way he can.
l've slept on it.
l've got a plan.
Forty-something female
marketing executives.
l don't understand a word.
Don't worry, just count the money
that your uncle Ákos will
get you by the weekend.
Will you be long, darling?
No, just the car scene to do.
l'll take you out to lunch.
At last!
Are you sure you want to
take me to meet the American?
We should have left ages ago.
Answer my question.
Would l be here otherwise?
At my age it takes
time to get presentable.
Oh come on, you're only 28.
Twenty-seven.
- So?
- Nothing. Alex wants to see you.
- Why? He doesn't even know me.
- That's why.
- And you?
- l know you.
Very funny.
lf Alex didn't want to see me,
would you still take me?
Don't torture me, or
l'll bite your ear off.
l heard that's a family trait.
We're late.
Men find women more exciting
if they have to wait for them.
Now, what should l wear?
lf it was up to me,
nothing else.
Timi's the sexy
provocative one.
No point in competing with her,
so l'll be simple and decent.
A natural wild flower.
Okay, okay. Just get dressed.
- Hey, l've turned you on.
- No.
The evidence is
here in my hand.
Schnell?
Okay, but really schnell.
Snap it on, l'll be
back in a minute.
Black.
Makes it look smaller.
Sex on the Beach?
That's for me.
Ask him how he likes Budapest.
- He's only been here one day.
- That's okay.
Ask him. l can't speak
English in the evening.
He doesn't really know,
he's only been here one day.
But has he seen the er...
the parliament building?
Eat the olive.
lt's good for your skin.
We could talk about the film.
Yes, the film!
Tamás is making a film, and
l'm playing the lead role.
- Who told you that?
- l did.
You said the lead role
was based on me.
So?
l'm a born actress.
The camera loves me.
Everyone knows that.
l'm the only one who loves you.
Shut up.
- András, have you got a job?
- Yes.
Any good?
Shit.
- l'm quitting.
- Good idea.
May l recommend this
Villányi Cabernet Sauvignon?
We saved it for you.
Make some kind of a toast.
- Who said?
- You.
- When?
- Today.
- l don't remember.
- But l do.
Help me out.
Tell him l made it myself.
He said it can't have taken
long, it's so skimpy.
This is the 21 st century.
You're so behind the times.
Come to the office tomorrow.
We'll do our sums,
and l'll have the
money in a flash.
Maybe we don't
even need this joker.
You know what? l'll chip in
too, if my numbers come up.
Tell Alex about your
winning numbers.
Relax. Don't overdo it.
Can l have dessert?
Your turn in the jungle.
l've had enough exhaust fumes.
- What are you writing?
- Nothing, just private...
This is fucking cool!
- You can rap to it.
- lt's just a parody.
Write a few more of these, and
we'll be the kings of rap.
l though you were
going to college.
To hell with college
if l can make money.
l don't agree.
Then just wag your
tail and dream on. Bye!
Good morning.
You've had two calls.
Someone from Porsche-Hungária
wants to know if you'll be able
to make the salon opening...
- Coffee?
- Coffee.
l put the documents, and
something on your desk, and...
- ...and my brother's here.
- Yes.
That old hag drives me crazy.
She's always
tidying up after me,
and l can never find anything.
Do me a favor and screw her.
She's crazy about you.
You've had women that were
crazy about me before.
Twice, but only as a favor.
- You bastard. l only knew about one.
- Only one, but l screwed her twice.
- Lívia!
- Happy name day, Ákos.
You really shouldn't have.
Get me the phone numbers
of all the marketing directors
we deal with.
What do you think of Alex?
Foreign, cautious.
A bit strange.
Do you think he's gay?
He's got the hots for Eszter.
- You're imagining it.
- You didn't see how he looked at her.
Well, nothing's free...
ldiot!
So, how much do we need?
Sixty.
Sixty million Hungarian
forints. ln five days.
This Alex hit us like
a bolt from the sky.
That's the film industry.
A den of iniquity.
Full of swindlers and thieves.
That's why you get
on so well with us.
You might be right.
- Coffee?
- l've only got two hands.
And what big ones!
Lívia, l never noticed how
big everything is on you.
Door!
So, here are the ones
l have to convince.
And how?
Either through logic
or my male charm.
You're going to screw all
the marketing managers?
No, only the women.
Chocolate?
''But you don't care about that.''
''You didn't care at all.
You pretended to be in love again...''
- Hello.
- Mrs Terka. lt's me, Ákos.
- Who's this?
- Who wants to be a Millionaire?
Turn off that bloody thing.
Ákos! l didn't
recognize your voice.
Hold on, l'll switch
off the vacuum cleaner.
Why did he have to call now?
Now l'll never know
what Eulalia said to Rodrigo.
Hello. What's up Ákos dear?
l'm having a party this evening,
put out the glasses and plates.
Don't worry about
hoovering the carpets.
- l've already done them.
- Well roll them up then.
What was on TV this morning?
Ákos, you know l don't
understand these modern ones.
Okay. That's settled then.
And please come tomorrow,
there's bound to be a mess.
- Can l get back to work now?
- l'm gone.
That bastard Rodriguez.
Always stirring the shit.
Your attention please!
All the way from America,
Alex Brubeck.
Treat him like one.
This is Alex, my producer.
Let me introduce you to Éva.
A tourist guide in Africa.
We dated two years ago.
Tímea, singer.
Now he's dating me.
l don't envy you.
l really don't envy you.
Do you get on this
well with all your exes?
My one true love! Can l help it
if l can't split acrimoniously?
That gives me great
hope for the future.
l can't afford not to
chase after rich guys.
- l won't translate that, okay?
- Why not? At least l'm open about it.
Come on, let's dance.
What? You're turned
on by my Polski Fiat?
Why so late?
l've been working.
Did you say you're a baker?
Not any more.
Hi András.
But you still won't
say what you do.
Not now, please.
You want me to drown
my sorrows in cake?
l wonder what's in it...
Wow. Sneaky!
You know which of
your adverts l like best?
l think you're
about to tell me.
Yeah.
The one where that guy
can have all those silly wishes
and wants to turn into a frog
and all that...
And that one where the four
guys in hats tell jokes...
l didn't do those.
What's wrong with you,
surrounded by all these chicks?
They're for people like you:
directors, managers, producers.
lncredible party, isn't it?
l've invented a
new computer game.
Cool! l've got a hard on.
What about you?
What an incredible chick!
lf she wasn't mine l'd be
totally crazy about her.
She seems to be
enjoying herself.
Let's not disturb her.
Come on.
The screen shows
a yuppie party.
A load of wankers and their stupid
tarts. Crap music is playing.
Stupid flashing lights, and
dickheads dancing badly.
You have to move among
them with the joystick.
You have a bloody
great baker's shovel,
which you use to brain the
ones that irritate you most.
The graphics would be best when
the shovel smashes their heads.
Stupid. And what's the goal?
Smash all the assholes
and their ugly women,
and make off with the hot chicks.
ls it just me,
or have others noticed
the psychopath hiding behind
that timid, intellectual mask?
What does this remind you of?
You, with horns
on your forehead.
Fuck you!
No heart-to-hearts,
it's party time!
Come on. Come on.
l'm off. l don't want
to be in the way.
Hey! Are you really a baker?
Fuck you.
l'm allergic to animal hair.
Let's slip out.
What?
Don't you want to?
Wh... What?
l'll explain in a minute.
Relax, it won't hurt.
Timi. Tell me honestly.
ls sex good with me?
Who the bloody hell was that?
Why don't you sleep.
lt's still early.
l'm sleeping.
The hell you are.
l'm thirsty and hungry.
l'll see if anything's
left over.
Do all pharmacologists
speak such good English?
Only the ones that learned it.
Like a plague of locusts,
nothing's left.
l'll go to the shops.
l'll go.
You get yourself together,
you look terrible.
Oh my God what a mess.
l'll be here until the evening.
What's wrong, Mrs Terka?
Never seen a naked man?
l've forgotten.
Was it such a shock?
Not exactly a pleasant sight.
Timi!
Mrs Terka's criticizing my ass.
What do you think?
What's the time?
Can you see?
l don't want to see anything,
especially no more naked men.
Couldn't you all
just go to work?
We'll be gone in a minute.
Be careful with those.
They cost a fortune.
l'm warning you.
l thought you didn't
know how to use the TV.
l just sat on this... thing,
and it came on.
ls there a connection?
Who knows.
Just don't forget to
sit on it again when you leave.
Everything'll be tidy
when l come back?
You know me, Ákos.
That's why l asked.
Are you still here?
This evening?
Why not take him to
that new place by the opera?
Will you sober up by then?
What for?
Tell the kid, too.
Hey, l'm performing
at the Stone tonight.
You promised to
come and see me.
She's right.
l did promise.
Okay, we'll go there, then take
him to our favorite place.
And who's going to keep
me happy until tonight?
Your middle finger.
Bastard!
Didn't you say you were
going for a manicure?
What?
See? Even Alex understood that.
Alex, you've got to sign the
internet contract with PSlNet,
the director's impatient
for the marketing plan,
and Mr Majoros left
a message that...
l want a mess.
Dr Hámori?
She'll be here at ten.
Send her right in.
Mr Majoros says you
can transfer the first payment,
the internet contract
is ready to be inked...
Dr Hámori's here.
Good morning,
l'm 90 seconds late. l apologize.
Good morning. Please come in.
Can l get you a soda?
Coffee? Tea?
No thank you. l'd rather
we weren't disturbed.
Don't let anyone in until the
deputy state secretary leaves.
Come here you animal,
let me smell you at last!
What was with the official tone?
Sorry, in my position
appearances are everything.
You're certainly doing well.
But you're still my Rambo.
And you're my Rambina!
My Barbie doll. My little muff.
Yes, and l'm yours,
my little G.l. Joe
G.l. Jane!
- Take me, you animal!
- l am.
Why did you call me?
l'm older than you,
but not stupid.
You think l'm using you?
Yes, but l love that in you.
l need sponsors.
You?
No, my brother's film.
ls it any good?
lt'll be a box-office success.
How much do you need?
Five million.
Haaah. . .
Okay, okay, six.
You're generous.
Excuse me for a moment,
we have to submit the annual...
Lívia, can't you
see l'm in a meeting?
...the annual report.
lt still needs typing,
but we have to
check the data...
...because if we're late...
...if we miss the deadline
the boss will eat us...
alive.
They suit you.
Can't it wait five minutes?
Okay, l'll transfer the money.
Sure you don't want a coffee?
Tea?
Sure!
Doesn't that battleaxe
get on your nerves?
Of course she does.
A lump of dead meat,
to put it mildly.
Screw her once and she'll
eat out of your hand.
l'd rather become gay.
You owe me a screw.
This is costing me,
so l want my money's worth.
Six million then?
Five.
He's all yours, darling.
Keep trying.
Those barons have
eaten everything.
Straitened circumstances
always improve a real artist.
Did you make an appointment
with my secretary?
What appointment?
What secretary?
l'll fire her.
l told her to call you to
make an appointment.
But what luck that we're here.
Let me introduce Alex Brubeck,
porn producer. Oscar
winning porn producer.
He's looking for talented girls
with exceptional lQs.
Me too.
Porno?
But top notch.
The director.
The director of photography.
l'll have to ask my boyfriend.
l really like this place, why
do you have to get us banned?
l'm casting. Casting.
My boyfriend.
Good friend, Good friend,
Good friend, Good friend.
Vali told me what it's about.
And?
We can discuss it.
Good.
But only with me, too.
What?
Only l can screw her.
l'll have to discuss
this with the producer.
We need to know your er...
parameters.
l have to show you?
l think it's unavoidable.
Here?
lf you're shy,
let's just forget it.
Maybe with a telephoto...
No, a fish-eye lens.
We'll have to zoom in on it.
You great clot!
Can't you see
they're making fun of you?
Get out of here.
Why? Everything's fine.
Spaghetti, three beers,
peach juice: 1 7,600
l'll kill you, Rodriguez,
you bastard.
Fuck you.
Let's go.
You. What did you say?
l'm sorry.
Ohne accent.
Are you Hungarian?
l got out in '84.
What's the problem?
So it's Sanyi!
Problem?
No-one asked, and it's
none of your business.
But you took us for a ride.
So the whole thing was an act?
So aren't you a producer?
Why? Just because
l speak Hungarian?
l live in America,
l'm an American citizen.
What's changed?
l swear l'll hit him.
Don't do that again.
You understood every
fucking thing we said.
That's your problem. Sorry.
l think l'll hit him again.
How granny stares.
Muppet show?
Okay.
One, two, three...
Other side!
One, two, three...
Hey, after them!
Don't get the idea
we've forgiven you.
Of course not, but we'll lose
the chicks if we make up now.
Fucking hell, l forgot.
Stop the car.
l've got to work.
We'll take you there.
No, here's fine.
Stop please.
l'll be in the Stone at 1 1 ,
l promise. Just stop.
lt'd be better if
we gave you a lift.
Bye.
Where have those pussies gone?
Yes?
Yes.
Really?
Okay, l'll be right there.
An ambulance has
gone for Mrs Terka.
The Hi-Fi was on full blast,
she was singing out loud
and she's molesting all
the male neighbors.
What have you drunk?
Mrs Terka, isn't it?
Look!
lt's that cute Dr Ross.
Are you on medication?
My sweet Hussar!
What terrorist
organization sent you?
A quick dance?
The music, the music,
l need the music...
Mrs Terka, what's going on?
My dear Ákos.
Turn around.
Your ass is bare again.
What do you think?
l haven't a clue.
She might have drunk
something on medication.
What'll you do with her?
We'll take her in and
pump her stomach.
They'll take care of you.
You know how important you are to us.
Only because l'm a woman.
And what a woman!
Easy girls,
l'm like Spanish flu:
easy to catch.
l thought you'd forgotten me.
Mrs Terka got stoned,
and had to go into detox.
You're having me on.
She scoffed the hash cakes.
She must've been
high as a kite.
Any hot chicks around?
None with any brains.
You want to talk to them?
l'd rather screw them.
Anyway, Timi's here.
She'll just do her
turn and leave.
Anyway, it's a guy's night out.
Another whisky, please.
Look. These are my poems.
Really good.
You can rap to them.
- Wanna hear?
- Not really.
lt's loud in hear.
Try reading them.
Are you mad?
Listen, do you want
to be in a film?
l'm making a film.
- lt's called ''Guilty City''.
lnterested? - Uh huh.
l'm the producer.
l'm American.
My name's Alex.
l'm looking for girls with
exceptional lQs, like you.
l've heard that patter
somewhere before.
Hey, be quiet.
Routine inspection.
Your documents please.
Good evening, Comrade officer.
Are you drunk?
As a skunk.
What makes you think
you're capable of driving?
l'm not capable.
You know you shouldn't
have even got into the car?
They bundled me in here,
there were six of them.
lt was assault,
Comrade Officer.
Crawl out and show
me your papers.
But Officer,
l don't even
have a driving license.
Have you got legs?
Get out.
Excuse me, Officer.
Please don't interfere, Sir.
l'm driving. Here's the
wheel in front of me.
Go and check the
steering wheel.
Why? lsn't it in its place?
This is most unusual.
Routine inspection,
your papers please.
Thank you.
lt's not in Hungarian.
- English?
- American.
But you speak Hungarian?
Does it seem otherwise?
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
- Sure?
- Ziher.
lf you speak Hungarian,
do it properly.
Sure.
Why don't you mix
with your own kind.
You're right, Officer.
You're a decent
person, like us.
Have a good journey.
And sort out this
little lot ASAP, okay?
Good-bye.
Everything's allowed
these days.
And everything else.
Do you need this?
- l can't take it any more.
- What?
The whole thing.
Shit work for pin money.
l'm leaving.
- Where to?
- America.
Just like that?
l've been to an interview.
They said l had a real chance
because l'm the only
one with experience.
And what's the job?
l'll be Mickey Mouse
in Disneyland.
lf l'm really good
l might get
promoted to Donald Duck.
And when you get old you'll
be made into Uncle Scrooge.
What a career!
What's wrong with you?
Are you blind?
We almost crashed.
Stupid ape.
What is it?
Slammed my tail in the door.
Pull it in.
Hi!
Oh God. You again?
Sorry my CD's selling so well.
Thanks to your first video.
l've thanked you
a thousand times.
lt's not my fault it made
me so successful.
Should l call you Sanyi,
or just stick to Alex?
You won't keep on about
this all afternoon, will you?
You got over it easily enough.
l've explained it to the guys,
don't make me do it again.
So, what's today's program?
A city tour.
But you grew up here too.
A lot has changed in 1 8 years.
l'll tell you some stories.
- l like your dress.
- l know.
- Hello girls. lce cream?
- Who are you?
He's got no brain, just a...
...thing up front.
Where've you been?
ln the lab.
lt was a long experiment.
What experiment?
An important one.
You want the details?
You never used to care.
You look good.
ls your phone broken?
Why?
l rang you at work and on your mobile.
Was it that important?
Yes.
Do you want supper?
Do you want supper?
No, thanks.
And me?
No thanks, l'm
not hungry any more.
No, l'm tired.
What do you think of Alex?
What?
What do you think of Alex?
He seems okay.
More specifically?
What?
More specifically?
Alex is intelligent, sensitive,
charming, polite.
And he thinks
you're very talented.
You talked about me?
Why? lsn't it allowed?
When?
Where?
- Do you think he'll help?
- l'm sure of it.
At what cost?
You'll make a deal.
Over you?
You're so tasteless.
- Me?
- Yes you.
We did everything in front of
you, and you knew everything
but you didn't do
anything to stop it.
lf l was a bit more important
than your fucking film...
So don't blame me
for nothing, okay?
Have you slept with him?
Did you make him a
black coffee as well?
lf l see the situation right,
l've been dumped.
So l don't know why
you're still here.
Nor do l.
Well l sure fucked that up.
Mrs Terka! l'm here.
TV?
Some stray electricity?
l don't know.
lt must have come on while
l was dusting the remote.
That's why l love you so much.
Because of your sharp mind,
not because you clean well.
You're always pulling my leg.
Have you got any cake?
You know what kind l mean...
God forbid, Mrs Terka.
But seriously,
l'd like you to go.
- Why?
- You can take the TV.
l've got an important
business meeting.
And does Timi know about it?
l'll get it.
Who shall l say is calling?
l've come to see Ákos.
On what business?
l'll take it from
here, Mrs Terka.
And if she's a burglar?
We both know she isn't.
- Mrs Terka was just leaving.
- Oh yes.
Don't you need anything?
Drink, nibbles, coffee,
- A4 paper?
- A4 paper? What for?
For the meeting.
You look better than ever.
lf only l knew why
you thought of me.
Ákos, l almost forgot. There's
cabbage stew in the fridge.
l made it for you.Your favorite,
but only enough for one.
Thanks, thanks.
- Where were we?
- You've got a strange maid.
And she's not even stoned.
A drink?
He knows.
Kentucky Bourbon
Did you hear what l said?
Who knows what?
Tamás, about us.
What about us?
What's between us.
What is between us?
Don't you thing
there's anithing!
l can belive it!
You might be the most beauti...
What are you talking about?
But l live in America,
you live here.
You said you don't
live anywhere.
l'm afraid we don't
have a future together.
You were just playing with me?
Alex, answer me.
Did l lay a finger on you?
Did l kiss you?
Ask you for anything?
No.
So? Why do you say
l played with you?
Tamás played with you.
What do you mean?
You think our meeting at the
butcher's was a coincidence?
What an idiot l've been.
l'm such a stupid idiot.
Bloody hell!
You can't even fuck
in your own home.
What is it?
We need to talk.
Now?
l've been kicked
out of my apartment.
This isn't a good moment.
Oh, is Timi here?
Something... something similar.
Come back later, okay?
Okay. l just hope
it's not too late.
Kid, do you need money?
What a pair of
hopeless brothers.
My brother wants to
make a great film.
And l'm helping him raise money.
You are?
He's very talented.
ls he?
And we thought that
Marcus lnsurance Co...
could perhaps
sponsor the film.
Yes, but l don't work
there any more.
They fired me
a couple of weeks ago.
Really?
Go on.
lsn't the kid with you?
No. Why?
He was here half an hour ago,
seemed pretty down.
But l was working
in your interest.
l though he'd gone to you.
l'm worried he's done
something stupid.
He's probably reading his
poems to drunks in the pub.
l'll pick you up
in ten minutes.
How could you let him go
if he was really that down?
Should l have given
him two candles?
''Here, see how to
have a good fuck?''
He's got no job, no apartment.
No chick.
His problem is that he doesn't fuck.
ls that all you think about?
Nothing else matters.
You'll realize eventually.
And you're his role model...
No. You're his role model.
You're the artists.
l'm just a stupid economist.
Crap, you're the
family success story.
Not for long,
you little Spielberg.
Which way now?
Look over there.
What's he doing?
Keep going, don't startle him.
l'll get out and talk to him.
He'll jump.
He hasn't got the guts.
Don't start needling him.
Relax. l studied psychology.
Yeah, advertising psychology.
He'll notice the car.
Take it home.
This is a job for the
head of the family.
l'll be home in half an hour.
Agree with anything he says.
Can you drive an automatic?
Hello kid.
Can't l get some
peace even here?
You wanted to chat. Here l am.
l don't want to any more.
Then let's go home.
Piss off.
Are you offended?
You know l always
follow my dick.
The dirtiest whore is more
important than me.
l'm doing it for
the family movie.
You're always doing
it for something.
Just like Tamás,
just like our father.
All except me.
- Your talents are different.
- What are they?
You were always the favorites.
'A' students,
'A' sportsmen,
'A' Casanovas.
You had the good jobs
stacks of money.
Brilliant careers.
You don't look at me
for months on end.
You bought me a pager
so you could reach me when l
was needed for some scam.
But you don't give a shit how l am.
Especially you.
At least don't interrupt now.
l'm wasting my breath anyway.
You can't change after 30.
We've grown up,
no-one can change things.
l've had enough.
l just want to
change this situation.
So farewell...
This is great rap.
You're a brilliant poet.
Better great than never!
l'm looking for Alex Brubeck.
Could you page him?
He's checked out.
When?
Just now.
For good?
For good?
lt seems that way.
Did he leave alone?
No.
Who was he with?
An exceptionally
pretty young lady.
DEAR LlTTLE SPOON,
l REALlSE NOW THAT
YOUR FAR M ORE lM PORTANT
THAN ANY FlLM .
At least don't interrupt now.
Are you still awake?
Of course. Where are you?
ln Hungary?
l'm at your place.
Where are you?
But why? How?
l found my keys, and l miss
you, and l love you, stupid!
Say that again.
Stupid.
Not that.
Can't l tell you in person?
l'm at Ákos' place, come over.
What are doing there at
two in the morning?
We are in deep trouble.
Hurry.
Okay, five minutes.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Ákos?
Wow.
lsn't he with you?
He just popped out,
he'll be here soon.
Thanks. Keep the change.
What's this? A surprise party?
Hello.
My family.
- l could have drowned.
- No you couldn't.
Never!
lt's not career-specific,
you idiot.
lt just occurred to me that
you can swim, and l can't.
And anyway, my allergy...
The little wanker threw
me in the river.
l didn't have any subtler
means of convincing him.
l've got the money!
l've got the money
for the film.
Half the budget.
Bloody hell.
lt was here yesterday evening.
Timi.
Where's Timi?
''Good morning dear.''
''Just ringing
to say don't look for me.''
''- Who're you phoning?
- Oh Alex. Just my ex.''
''Are you crazy?''
''Hang up for God's sake.
We've got to leave.''
Bloody hell. Look at this!
Police are searching for US
citizen Antal Mikó,
on suspicion of fraud under the
alias of Alex Brubeck...
Fuck!
...US authorities want him
for embezzlement,
and say he's probably operating
under the same name in Hungary.
THlS WEEK'S LOTTERY NUMBERS
