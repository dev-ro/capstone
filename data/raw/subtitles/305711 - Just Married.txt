I walked over.
I had to clear my head.
So? What happened?
I had the perfect
relationship...
that was ruined by marriage.
I mean, you saw it, right?
We were perfect from
the minute we met.
{y:i}Right?
Yeah. In fact,
it was nauseating.

On the graveyard shift.
Every other week.
When the full-time guy´s sick.
[ Chuckles ]
You´re that Tom?
Yeah. You actually
heard me on the air?
Yeah. I called in about
a week ago, like 3:00 a.m.
You said the Pasadena
freeway was all clear...
so I took it and got stuck
behind a jackknifed big rig...
for, like, three hours.
Sarah from Beverly Hills.
Who called me a...
fathead.
You got pretty heated.
Very heated.
So, 3:00 a.m.?
That´s a little bit past

That´s a good choice.

You´re not

Ha ha ha ha.

Wow.
Yeah.
{y:i}[ Tom Narrating ]
{y:i}And that was it.
{y:i}A month later,
{y:i}we moved in together.
And why the hell
did we get married...
when we had loving each
other so completely nailed?
I don´t know.
Ten seconds.
Well, why does anyone
get married?
Does it make sense
to be with one person...
for your entire life?
People change.
They grow.
You´re on, Tom.
Maybe we´d still
be together...
if I´d gotten
the proposal right...
but nope--
The proposal is critical,
and I blew it.
Tom!

missed the boat...
didn´t you,

You move in together
after a month...
live together for nine months,
and now you´re engaged.
Oh, I know you love him,
but you know...
sometimes it takes
more than love...
to sustain a marriage.
You need to be old enough
to know who you are...
and what you want
and who he is.
Oh, Mom, Mom,
he´s wild and spontaneous...
and hysterical
and offbeat...
and on top of all that...
he´s centered,
and he´s down to earth.
He´s everything I want...
and we have this passion
for each other...
that´s just... oh!
I´m jealous.
Ha ha ha!
All right.
First thing tomorrow...
we´re gonna plan
this wedding!
[ Screams ]
Hey, you.
So I guess everyone
thinks that we´re crazy...
for doing this.
Now, when did we start caring
about what other people think?
Well, are you sure that...
"y"ou don´t want to marry
a guy like Peter?
If I wanted to know
exactly what my life would be...
from here on out...
I would marry
a guy like Peter.
But I love not knowing.
I love our messy loft.

Ha ha.
I want to start a life
with you.
- "[ Mr. McNerney ] Sarah?"
- Go.
Hi, Daddy.

Its-- Its long-term viability...
is best established

We love each other.
That is all that matters, tsk.

Oh, I hope she doesn´t
spook on you, man.
What do you mean?
I love Sarah.
Don´t get me wrong, but...
rich chicks spook.
A powerful daddy
plus family money...
equals expectations.
Expectations are like
a fungal rot on a marriage.
My marriage is not
gonna have a fungal rot.
We´re gonna be
happily married every day...
for the rest of our lives.
Unless she finds out that
"y"ou slaughtered her dog.
Oh, don´t worry.
I´ll take that to my grave.
Okay.
If you change your mind
at the altar...
just pass out.
I´m not going to
change my mind.
Okay. I´m just saying
if you do...
just hit the floor.
Thank you, but it´s
not gonna happen.
So, you´re sure
"y"ou´re ready...
to give up
"y"our grazing rights?
I´m not a grazer, Kyle.
Well, what if you became one
later in life?
I mean,
over the next 1 0 years...
"y"ou´re giving up
five hayrides per year.
So I can either be
happily married to Sarah...
or have
50 one-night stands.

That´s not even a choice.

with that yahoo?

in Europe once.

And you could´ve had Peter.
I did have Peter.
It wasn´t that hot, okay?

ran into Peter--
We went out.

way too much...
{y:i}and before

tussled.
You bad girl.
I wanted to tell Tom
so many times...
but he gets so jealous,

Listen, it doesn´t matter
that he doesn´t know.
It´s not like

and even if you were--
No, no, no.

Honey,
just for the record...
when you talk
about money...

to it coming out of your heinie...
it sort of kills
the romance of the moment.

{y:i}Right. Sorry.

Now fight your deep urge
to be cheap...
and give the bellboy
a large tip.
Hey.
Do you guys, uh,

No, our reservation
isn´t till Tuesday.
So we´ll stay there
a few extra days.
I just put an entire castle
on my credit card.
We can´t afford
to stay at the Gianna...
for a few extra days.
So? I´ll call my dad up...
and he´ll lend us
the money, okay?
No. No. There is
no possible way...
I´m taking money
from your dad.

about this nice little

Excuse me.
Could you just drive?
{y:i}Pleasejust let me
{y:i}call my dad. Please?
No! This is our honeymoon.
Not his.
So it´s fine
to just stay...
at some "pensione" that
"y"our father recommended.
Look, we´re staying at
the "Pensione Funicello..."
and we´re gonna have
a hell of a good time.
I can´t take this
anymore.
Honeymoons
are supposed to be...
all champagne,
and room service...
and lovemaking--
We haven´t made love--
{y:i}And no, no, no.
{y:i}What do we get?
We get evicted
from a five-star hotel...
and to boot,
I´m yelling at you!
We´re yelling
at each other!
We´re not really
"y"elling at each other.
I´m the one that´s yelling,
and I´m sorry...
and I wanna
go home right now.
Maybe we should go home.
I know this honeymoon
hasn´t been perfect.
But I´m sure
that the "pensione´s..."
gonna be fine.
Look, we´ll check in...
sleep late, eat pasta...
gaze out at

to talk to you.
Can´t you just tell him...
thank you from all of us
here at the gorgeous Gianna?
Huh?
Shh.
Hello there,
Mr. McNerney.
Please bear in mind that
our daughter loves him, Dan.
Listen, Leezak--
Um, I don´t expect
a cracker like you...
to ever measure up...
to anything approaching
what I would consider...
a good match
for my daughter...
but I´ll tell you
what I do expect.
I expect you to pay me
back in full...
just as soon as that...

of reasonable income.
{y:i}Good-bye, cracker.

What was that?
He called me a cracker.
A cracker, honey.
He did not. Huh.
What?
That surprises you?
Your dad hates me.
[ Imitating Mr. McNerney ]
Well, wonderful. Wonderful.
He´s got your
whole family...
praying that
this marriage fails.
{y:i}That´s not fair.
Mom´s never said
a bad word about you.
Wow! Pussy´s never
insulted me!
Now I feel loved!
Like your father´s
never judged me?
No, he hasn´t.
Not once.
Maybe we should
just have sex.
Call me crazy...
but I´m just not
in the mood to make love.
I´m not either, but...
we haven´t had sex once
since we´ve been married.
And there is something
very, very wrong with that.
[ Laughs ]
And I have to tell you--
Why are you laugh--
It´s not funny.
[ Laughs ]
I´m sorry.
I´m concerned.
Let´s go to sleep,
we´ll get good rest.
We´ll sightsee tomorrow.
Be fresh in the morning.
Fine.
And then
we´ll have sex.

{y:i}?I see the world
{y:i}in a different light?
{y:i}? You shine so bright?
{y:i}? When I´m close to you?
{y:i}?I feel the way
{y:i}that you really are?
{y:i}?It moves my heart?
{y:i}? You amaze me?
{y:i}? You lift me up

See...
I knew you were going
to make me pay...
for watching the game.
No.
No, it´s not that.
We need to talk.
About what?
Have you always
told me the truth?
Yeah.
Except the time
I told you...
I liked your
brother Willie.
- This is serious.
- I am serious.
I really don´t like him.
Marriage is built
on honesty and trust.
- I totally agree.
- Okay.
Then did you ever
do something...
that you wanted
to tell me about...
but you couldn´t because
"y"ou felt bad about it?
And the more time went on...
the harder it got
for you to tell me?
And then it turned into
this big, fat lie...
so you kept not
telling me about it--
Did you
talk to Kyle?
No. Why?
No reason.
Does Kyle know something
that I should know?
No.
You covered your nose.
I had an itch.
You were hiding
flared nostrils.
What do you have to tell?
Okay.
It´s just...
when Bags died...
he didn´t
exactly die...
the way that
I described it.
Him chasing those squawking
pigeons off the balcony?
Yeah, that.
What happened?
"Well"--
Okay. I´m reading
my magazine...
and I´m really--
I´m focusing...
and I´m really into it...
and along comes
Bags, you know?
{y:i}He comes trucking over...
{y:i}and he starts
{y:i}tugging on my ankle.
"And I was like," ´´"Bags.!´"`
{y:i}I´m... I´m...
"I was like"--
I think I even said,
"´´"I´m trying to focus.´´
Like, don´t--
And he looked up at me...
and he was giving me
the look like...
´´"Hey, are you gonna"
"play with me or not?´"`
{y:i}And I was like...
´´"I reallyjust want"
"to read though, Bags. ´"`
And... I´m... and...
he started pulling
on my ankle again.
{y:i}So, I grabbed the ball...
{y:i}and I was like,
´´"Go get it, buddy. ´"`
{y:i}And I threw the ball
{y:i}over my shoulder...
{y:i}and it went out
{y:i}the window...
{y:i}and Bags dove,
{y:i}and he died.
You killed Bags?
It was an accident.
And you lied about it
all this time?
Actually, it was
more of an omission.
No, it was
more like a lie!
Where are you going?
I have to figure out
what to do with this.
What does that mean?
I can deal with you
being cheap...
and I can deal with you
being a shitty driver.
I cannot not deal
with you being a liar!
Whoa. Wait a second.
This whole thing started...
with you wanting
to talk about something.
Well, I don´t want to
talk about it right now.
So you´re feeling guilty
about something too.
Yes, there is something
I "´´"omitted´´
that I don´t want to
talk about right now.
You want a marriage based
on trust and honesty?
Well, here´s your chance.
Come on!
{y:i}Yeah,yeah,you got it.!
{y:i}I can see it.!
Bring it!
I slept with
Peter Prentiss.
What?
I slept with Peter--
{y:i}I heard you.!
I´m sorry.
I need to hear everything.
{y:i}No,you don´t.

- Before we--
- Got married?

- Got engaged?
- Of course!

What´s Salviati´s?
One of the oldest...
and most beautiful
estates in Venice.
Maybe Mr. Peter
will buy it.
Of course
Mr. Peter will buy it.
All right.
Where is this place?
Hmm?
You can´t go.
You will be
shot on sight.
Okay, that´s--
Uh--
When are they
coming back?
Your wife and Mr. Peter
are out for the evening.
You know what?
Naw, forget it.
I´m not going to be waiting
here for her when she gets back.
Oh, no!

Maybe we should

I think we should

That was the longest freakin´

Hey. Wendy, uh...
I couldn´t find you
in the crowd.
That´s cool.
Are you ready to go?
Uh... yeah.
Listen, um...
why don´t I just, uh...
walk you back
to your hotel...
and drop you off?
That sounds like a plan.
Okay. Um...
what hotel are

What hotel are
"you" staying at?
Uh, the Gianna.
Oh, my God!
Me too!
Hey.
Wow.
Oh, my God.
This is like

I couldn´t agree
with you more.

Can I use

Thank you.

Hey.
What? What?
What?
I can´t take this anymore.
I´m on my honeymoon!
{y:i}Gosh.!
Calm down.
You were just doing
the same thing with Wendy.
You have no right
to be angry.
You slut!
Excuse me?
You had your tongue
down his throat.
I saw it out the window!
{y:i}[ Glass Shatters ]
Did you see me
slap him, then?
Oh, don´t give me that.
Some part of you wants him.
Just say it!
Fine.
I´m not gonna lie anymore.
Certain things would be
easier given his background...
{y:i}and a small part of me thought...
"that I wanted that once"--
A very small part.
Why would you invite him
on our honeymoon?
I didn´t invite him.
I don´t know how
he found us.
{y:i}Oh,yeah? Oh, well,
{y:i}maybe it was magic.
No, Peter must be
a warlock.
That´s yours.
Yeah, sure.
It matches perfect
with my red leather panties!
Okay.
{y:i}I met a woman
{y:i}at a bar.
Nothing happened.
You picked up
a total stranger at a bar...
brought her back
to our honeymoon suite...
and took off
her disgusting red bra.
Nothing happened.
I swear.
No, no, no. The bra just jumped
off her bare naked breasts.
No, no, no. The bra just jumped
off her bare naked breasts.
Sarah--
You sit there and make me
feel guilty for a kiss--
A kiss that I didn´t even
want in the first place.
Don´t tell me
"y"ou didn´t want it.

Hello, Peter.
So glad you could join us.
Welcome to the honeymoon
from hell, shitheel!
What are you doing, Tom?
I think it´s time for
Peter and I to tangle!
See! You have no future
with this lunatic!
Shut up, Peter!
Tom, you´re acting
like a crazy person.
Maybe it´s ´cause I
just got hit in the head...
with a 1 0-pound ashtray!
I gotta warn you, Leezak.
I studied karate
with a Chinese grand master.
{y:i}Yeah? Well,
{y:i}I hope he showed you...
how to pull a fire poker
outta your ass!
Tom, put the poker down.
Fredo, call the police!
{y:i}Polizia.! Polizia.!

[ Fredo Screaming ]
You sat...
at our wedding.
You heard us take our vows!
And you still have the nerve...
to show up on our honeymoon...
and try to have sex--
- Whoa!
- With my wife!
- Run, you coward!
- Get him!
You stay away
from my wife!

Everyone.

What´d he say?
Peter just bailed us out.
That´s--

I´m going home.

Are you leaving with
any fruit, vegetables...
or any currency
in excess of $1 0,000?
No. No, but my husband
does have...
two pounds of hash

I had on my honeymoon...
was with a man
named Santino...

Excuse me, stewardess,
can I--
Uh, could I get, uh,
one of those, uh...

Yeah. Right away.
Sweet girl.
[ Sarah ]
Excuse me. Sorry.
Aaah!
I feel like we´ve been
married for 50 years.
Oh, you should be
so lucky.
You want to tell me how Peter
ended up at the same hotel?
Want to tell me what really
happened with Red Bra?
What? What?
What are you lookin´ at?
I hope you used a rubber.
No, I didn´t.
It didn´t get that far.
I hope Peter used one though.
Oh, they don´t sell
condoms that big.
Ha. Ha. Ha-ha.
Yeah, that´s funny.
That´s fun-- Hear that?
We got a comedian
on the plane.
Yeah. You´re a laugher.
You-- You want a laugh?
You want me
to make you laugh?
You think
I´m really funny?
I´m gonna move out
when I get home.
Great!
That´s great!
- The second we get home.
- Excellent. Know what?
- I´m done talking now.
- Me too.

What´s up?
She came back
to the apartment.
Is she there now?
No, she left.
Did she say anything?
{y:i}She took all her stuff.
It can´t be good.
Oh, and she left you this.
Let´s see.
Beer?
{y:i}Come on, man.
You´re gettin´ divorced.
Breakfast beer is a must.
I need
to talk to my dad.
Gimme a lift?
{y:i}Sure.
Gonna tell me
what you´re chewin´ on?
I just don´t know if
love is enough anymore.
What do you mean,
"´´"enough´´?
I mean...
even if Sarah and I
do love each other...
maybe we did need more time
to get to know each other.
So--
[ Clears Throat ]
What you´re saying
here is...
"y"ou had a couple of
bad days in Europe...
and... it´s over.
Time to grow up,
Tommy.
{y:i}Some days your mother and me
{y:i}loved each other.
Other days
we had to work at it.
You never see the hard days
in a photo album...
but those are the ones...
that get you from one
happy snapshot to the next.
{y:i}I´m sorry
{y:i}your honeymoon stunk...
{y:i}but that´s
{y:i}what you got dealt.
{y:i}Now you gotta
{y:i}work through it.
Sarah doesn´t need
a guy with a fat wallet...
to make her happy.
I saw how
"y"ou love this girl.
{y:i}How you two
{y:i}lit each other up.
She doesn´t need
any more security than that.

that I love Sarah.
