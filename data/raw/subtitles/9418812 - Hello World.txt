Kyoto, 2027
This is Kyoto
In collaboration between
Keito University and Pluura
It's a project to record the
city's history in details.
Under development,
the Chronicle Kyoto.
We can still catch it
Hurry, hurry!
Safe!

Karaoke?
Then, what about Kawaramachi?
Hey, do you want to come too?
Hey!
Sorry, uhm...
I'm Katagaki
Ah, yes, yes, Katagaki-kun
Today we'll be going to a
karaoke with the class
Ah, ehm...
Ah, if you have something
else to do, it's fine, sorry
Uhm, no...
Let's go!
Waait!
Slow...
Sorry, sorry!
Hurry up!
Everyone's already there?
Yeah, today, 30 of us
[Decisiveness]
Don't just worry about
everything! Decide quickly!
Hey you! Which one do you want?
A cinnamon twist, please
Alrighty! A cinnamon twist!
Don't care how others see
you! Speak out your thoughts!
Do you want to choose Arts?
I don't know...
I'm bad at it...
My seat...
What about calligraphy?
My handwriting is really bad.
Don't let others decide for you!
Decide on your own!
Next one is librarian!
Who likes books?
Katagaki?
Is it okay?
Uhm...
I'll do it.
I see, so it's Katagaki.
How to write his name?
Well, like Kata...
Now, a girl...
Ichigyou, will you do it?
It's okay, Katagaki-kun!
[Believe in your intuition!]
It wasn't helpful...
Which class that girl is in?
Like an idol...
Huuh, are you from Higashinaka...
I've also lived there.
Then, it's the start of the committee
[The Library Committee's jobs]
Now, for the end,
everyone please come here
For communication,
we have made a group on WIZ
Kadenokouji-san, let's exchange numbers
Oh, okay
Uhm, me too
Waa, in a same group!
I did it!
Me too!
Thank you, Kadenokouji-san!
Add yourselves as friends
So you can reach others any time
Alright everyone! Let's head home!
Go then
Let's grab our bags
I... Ichigyou-san...
Hm?
Ehm... You are not in that group...
Don't you... want to exchange numbers...
She's opening WIZ?
Uhm... Just the number is fine...
It's in Profile under Settings...
Here, if you want something
An address?
[Reading diary]
Today, the library closes
at 4, due to maintenance
In case you would like to
borrow a book, 10 minutes before...
Do I read it at home...
What's that...
A crow?
Huh?
It's legs...
Wa...
Wait!
Where's that bird going...
What?
Huh?
I... got in?
I did it!
It was successful, yes, yes!
But... Fushimi Inari?
It's off
Is the accuracy limited?
Wait... Or the place has moved...
Hey! What day is it today?
Si... Sixt...
Ah, he doesn't see me
Katagaki Naomi?
Please don't follow me!
Wait!
Hey! Why are you running?
What was that guy...
I see
It's convenient
What?
3 months before it...
Perfect!
I'll call the police!
Please don't follow... me?
He doesn't see me
What... the hell are you?
So, I'll tell you
What I am...
Then, Katagaki Naomi...
What are you?
Stop, stop, sto-
So you came
I had no choice
Just come on...
You are free anyway
Please don't decide for me,
I'm busy even thought it's Saturday
200 books in a year?
Center of Kyoto Prefecture's
History Records
It was in 2020, 7 years ago
That a collaboration project was started
thanks to the work of Pluura,
Keito University and the Kyoto Prefecture.
The Chronicle Kyoto
That's Pluura's, the world's
biggest web service's job
As all of you you already know
Services like maps are
now essential parts of our lives.
Compared to a normal 2D map,
a 3D map has more details
In addition, we can go back in
time to check records of all ages
That's what's the Chronicle Kyoto
project is about.
At least that's what they say
In order to be able to record the
endless information of the city,
You need a storage with huge space
However, Pluura has a
quantum computer project
Good morning everyone!
You can do anything if you are well!
It was made possible thanks to
Keito University's new theory
Let's do our best today as well!
Professor, there are
visitors today.
The result of that innovation,
is a recorder with infinite capacity.
This quantum storage
is the ALLTALE
Let's go!
Wa-
Uhm, sorry...
There's something...
I have to leave...
We have no time.
The bus is here.
Where are we going?
Demachiyanagi
Check the route
Travel to Demachiyanagi
So that's makes the
Chronicle Kyoto that much more detailed
That's right,
but on a whole different level
ALLTALE, the quantum storage...
has an infinite space
I can't tell you how big it is...
Hundred million, or
trillion records...
I can't imagine further
Run! Our time is tight!
Did we make it?
There's nothing
Nothing?
Nope, there is something
The events remain in the records
In 2020... the Chronicle Kyoto's
true purpose has been secretly started
Kyoto's whole area is observed
with a large number of drones
They are recording every
event in Kyoto to the ALLTALE
Every... event?
On 2027, April 17...
Katagaki Naomi who read
a book by the river...
Was hit by a falling drone
That's the recorded past
Past?
Yes, that is the recorded
past of Kyoto in the ALLTALE
You are the recorded past's
Katagaki Naomi in the ALLTALE
And I'm... accessing the
ALLTALE from the real world
Katagaki Naomi,
from 10 years in the future
Me... in 10 years?
I know everything about you;
well, because you're me.
I know, I know...
That's why I came here
You...
want a girlfriend
Not... particularly...
Ah, that thing really fell
and hurt you, Naomi...
I'll talk with the public office
It's fine...
Thank you, Mom!
I bought it...
That thing
Are you... really
me from the future?
Our heights are different?
You'll start growing
Well, I use this
avatar for access
But I can change my
appearance
If everything in this world
is recorded data... then what's real?
Real... it doesn't make
sense telling me that
This world is a perfect
copy of the real world
Reality that,
data that...
If we switched places,
you wouldn't be able to notice
It's meaningless asking what's real...
Saying it that way...
I have no choice but to accept it
You are adapting quickly
It's like something from Egan...
TL Note: Greg Egan is an Australian science fiction writer
But then...
If that world is the same,
then why did you come here?
I said it just now,
but I'll say it again!
Ah, wa-
To ease the pain of
your adolescent suffering
In other words,
to get you a girlfriend
Did you learn for class?
Not much
Kadenon, let's go back
Then, see you at lunch
Bye
Bye
There, there, pass!
Stop it!
Oops!
I'm sorry...
A cinnamon twist, please!
But Yukawa-senpai is...
Chair
Okay...
[Read only one book at once]
That... wait!
Why the toil-
It would be weird if you
talked
alone outside
Thank you for your concern
So, did you check it?
Yes, I saw, but...
Is that true?
That's right
Three months from now
You will start going out
with Ichigyou Ruri
What's with that face...
No, just...
I feel like Ichigyou-san
isn't for me...
Not for you?
Uhm... My type is
more like cute girls...
If I get close to her,
she will eat me alive...
The lone wolf type og
girls are a bit...s
Who did you just call not cute?
No, I didn't say she's not cute!
She's rather beautiful, but...
Just definitely not a
cute-type...
She is a cute-type!
Who did you watch?
Haven't you just mistaken
her for someone else?
Come, I'll show you
To the library
Remember, no talking!
Wait...
Look, that's Ichigyou-san,
right?
We are in the same committee,
I can't be mistaken
When we started going out...
An accident happened...
During the fireworks festival
that we went together to
A lightning strike hit a tree
Unfortunately it was next to her...
And she hasn't opened her
eyes again after that
My goal is to
tamper with that record
Tamper?
Rewrite the record three months
from now and prevent the accident
If her presence remains
It becomes the source of a reaction,
and the records surrounding her
will also be rewritten
In this infinite area...
A world will be recorded,
where Ichigyou Ruri is still alive
And then, what's the meaning of it?
Even if Ichigyou-san
lives in the recording...
She won't return to
the real world
Then, why?
We really just started dating...
We weren't able to
go anywhere...
I don't even have memories of her
Not even a single photo
Just once more...
I want her smiling face...
I want that record...
I want that memory...
Even if it's not real
Even if it's not me
I can't do anything
I can't even touch this world
with my avatar
I'm powerless
Please, lend me your power
But I...
But I still don't know anything...
I don't even know Ichigyou-san that well...
I can't even imagine going out with her
But...
I think I would be happy
going out with a pretty girl
And if I can prevent the
accident, I want to help too!
Uhm...
How should we call each other?
You call me "Sensei"
Just pretend it... It's a formality
I will teach you all kinds of things,
since I'm your senpai from 10 years
But... how can you help me?
Really! I can't do anything!
You should know me...
No, you are no longer powerless
Because you have me...
And this guy
Naomi?
I'm going!
Picture it with your mind
Imagine something real and simple
A plastic, rubber, paper
With all your heart
Grab!
I did it
Good Design,
the God's Hand
It has direct access to the
recorded world and the ALLTALE's data
A device that reviews the world itself
Water from air
Gems from the soil
Something from the nothing
It's an illusion
As an avatar, I have little
authority inside the ALLTALE
But the Good Design
has physical authority
You can touch and interfere
If you use that glove, the
illusion becomes reality
So, I can do anything?
In theory,
but there are many restrictions
First of all, only the part that
you touch directly can be rewritten
You can't create things far away
Also, the processing speed
depends on the amount of information
Thing like simple substances and
water are easy to make
But complex things take time and
they are hard to imagine
The living body is the hardest to make
Which part of the human body
has the most information?
Brain?
The human mind is the
center of information density
Even though it's called Good Design,
even it can't do it
So in other words, you can't
rewrite a human's mind...
Exactly!
So my job will be this
April 20th
I visited the Kita Library
to borrow some books. I went by bus.
Today, due to some events,
we grew closer together.
In another words,
if I follow Sensei's path
Ichigyou-san will become my girlfriend?
In that case... Wouldn't it be
the best if you just left me alone?
The moment I met you, the
records have already started changing
If I let you be, no one knows
what will happen then
I need to guide you
from now on
So, leave it to me
Just do what it says
This is the future diary,
The Perfect Manual
Then what should I do, Sensei!?
Well, first of all, take your book out
Open it!
Drop it!
So...
Pick it up!
Why would he-
Ah!
Nice!
It isn't nice at all!
She likes me even less now!
How is that the Perfect Manual!?
Don't worry
This is a necessary step
Ehm... Ichigyou-san...
About yesterday... Sorry
I picked this up
at the bus stop
I was looking for that
Sorry for not listening to you
No, it's my fault
I should have explained
Here
Thank you very much
Not at all
[I return her book mark. We made up.]
Just a little, I was able
to get closer to her
Just a little
Don't rush it
Your love has just begun
Go further, far away,
the love is still young
[President]
[Everyone bring a rug for Monday's bookshelf
cleaning. Reply to me during the weekend]
Even if the world is pointing
towards you from behind
Go further, without hesitation,
into your own universe with her
That hand, trembling in the pocket,
now just want to take you
[Thank you for letting me know]
I don't know the future,
so I can' lose sight
Mysterious techniques
Your charming nature
Even if the wind blows away my "I love you"
Our hands while connected loosely,
I will never let go of them
It's about time we go home
Well, I'm going this way
We were on the same bus...
Aren't we going in the same direction?
Ehm, no,  that time...
That time... That day
I was going to Kita Library!
Because there was a
"Mystery Magazine" there
Is that so?
I go there and read
as well, every month.
[Ichigyou-san asks about the bus ride the other day. Why don't you go there today? Suspicious. A good way to dodge the question. A book from the library?]
That is...
[Fireworks, playing with
fire is prohibited.]
Sensei
Sensei!
Look at this!
Isn't it great?
Iron! it's iron!
The density is good enough
Foreign matters
aren't too bad either
I secretly practiced during the night
I can make iron,
isn't it impressive?
Illusion
You should have dealt with
it, without getting scared
I can't deal with it,
it was too sudden!
Can't?
Will you say the same thing,
when time comes?
You can try to change it,
but you can't avoid it
Whatever happens
You have to be able to
protect her!
You have to be able
to do anything
The "Good Design" grants
you enough power for it
The rest is up to you
Imagination is the
most important thing
Realize that you can
create, like an iron, in an instant
Make your imagination
fly like as you are in a tale
Believe that anything is possible!
Rule everything!
Cold!
Hot
Ouch!
How's that?
Copper
There's a long
way ahead of us
Sorry
Ah! The time! I have to go!
Hey, wait!
It's today!
It was too high for me...
We all have shortcomings
Next time I'll do the
upper bookshelf
Then, I'll do the lower-
The large books are there,
I'll do that too!
Then, in the middle-
Let it be
Let's eat!
Splitting the bookshelf into
upper, middle and lower part
was always inefficient
However, because of that
we started talking more
There was one
turning point
Ouch, stop!
What are you grinning for?
I'm not grinning
I'm glad
It's thanks to your
note, Sensei!
What should I do next?
Just continue how you are now,
and everything will be fine
As long as we have
information of the future
You and Ruri are guaranteed
to be a couple
June 25
Charity Book Fair
Our biggest event, the
Secondhand Book Fair
Who knows it?
Okay... I expect similar interest...
From today, we will collect used books,
and sell them on that day
We also need an assistant
And the assistant usually
wears cute clothes
The shop assistant...
Kadenokouji-san in a
shop assistant cosplay?
Would you do it, Ruri?
I won't
And I told you to not call me that
Then...
Ruurii
I hate it
Ruririinu
No way. You aren't one to give up...
The Secondhand Book Fair in June
will be an important event for us
Do your best to collect books
I understand!
Gold!
Slow
But although it's collecting...
We've also put Offer Boxes
in the classrooms
Thank you for your help
[Secondhand Book Fair Offer Box]
The president told us too
that we shouldn't expect much
We've decided to collect, so
we can't just give up now
Let's do this!
[Three days left]
[Collected books: 37]
It doesn't need to be just collecting
If you find one at home, donate it
See ya
Should we do it?
This way
My late grandfather read
and collected these books
I don't think there's anything expensive
Amazing!
Let's offer some books
from here
I was wondering if it's okay
for someone to have so much
We decided to do it,
so we need to do anything we can
But is it okay?
Your grandfather's-
It's an important book
for you, right?
Obviously, I feel regret, that
they will be someone else's
My grandfather wasn't someone
who would have been angry
It's a book's desire
to be read
Then, how will we carry them?
Let's carry them!
The delivery service would
have cost money too...
What kinds of books do you like,
Katagaki-san?
Uhm...
That's bad... I don't
know the answer...
I... read almost anything
It's a shallow and wide feeling
Is that so?
I like adventure novels
Not giving up, even in hard times
I admire those who fight
until the very end
I want to live like that too
I think I want to be
like that
I...
I...
I like sci-fi books
Sci-fi can show you
wonderful new world
But they aren't just fairy tales...
They are extensions to our normal lives
They make me feel like
I'm part of a tale as well...
In the real world,
I'm just an extra
That's why I can't explain at all
But I like sci-fi
Is that so
That feeling...
I think I understand it too
[The City at the Bottom of the Great Lake]
That book... Can I read it a bit?
Do you want to take it?
No, I'll buy it in the Fair
Is that... a loan card?
I think it's a book that was
given away by a library
That's nice
If you are the first one who reads it,
and write you name on the top...
I think it must be a really good feeling
Ruurii, what happened?
Should we carry it to the library?
We need permission from
the teacher...
Ruurii, sorry
You've done so much by yourself
Please stop...
They weren't in use
But thank you, Ruurii
So...
There was this light
Hey, let's go
I'm glad it didn't spread
to the school building
If I knew it...
Could I have prevented it?
That would have
changed the record
The fire was one of the
necessary steps
The Secondhand Book Fair
was cancelled
She was depressed, and
I gave her comfort
As a result, it
brought us closer
You must do the same
Idiot...
It's no good
But... but!
Is that...
Sensei...
Thank you very much!
Uhm... Ichigyou-san...
Good morning!
One box was placed elsewhere
Even thought it's not even 50...
The Fair can be held now
This...
[The City at the Bottom of the Great Lake]
Ichigyou-san...
I'm glad that book is safe
Katagaki-san
Ruurii, Katagaki-kun!
Can it be...
That box...
It wasn't just us...
I brought all volume of that
demon love series!
But, grandmother,
what big eyes you have?
Read books from the
Secondhand Book Fair
Can I take a photo?
Yes, you can~
Why do you just
sit here, Ruurii?
Wait- Wait!
Huh...
The Secondhand Book Fair!
You didn't wake up
You were really tired
What?
No...
Because we tried our best
to sell many books...
We did it
Then, uhm...
[Donation Amount: ¥34850]
[SOLD OUT!!]
Yay!
Katagaki-san...
Thank you very much
No, uhm, I haven't done...
Thank you very much
[The City at the Bottom of the Great Lake]
[Ichigyou Ruri]
Uhm... I...
I...
Ichigyou-san...
I like you
Is that so?
Dating is something
you can't do alone
So... let's try it
together, shall we?
T... tha... that book...
That you wanted to read,
Katagaki-san...
I put it aside for you
Almost there
Unleash you imagination!
Be reckless!
Yes!
More! You can
do anything!
You can do anything
if you accept it!
This of the world as yours!
And then become...
The God of this World!
You pass
[ July, 3 (Saturday) ]
[Ujigawa Fireworks Festival]
That day, we went to
see the fireworks
The lightning strike's
was 20:01
But I made sure not to invite her
There aren't even rain clouds here...
Can we avoid it?
If there's nothing
And what if...
something happens
What... is that?
Did they come?
The Homeostatic System
It watches over the
ALLTALE's system files
And trying to fix them
back to the normal state
W... what should I do?
Design!
Bring out your weapon!
I could interfere
Yes!
Protect her until the time of the accident!
Let's keep it up until then
And then...
I'll tell you then! Now go!
Yes!
Behind you!
Right!
30 degrees to left!
Inside!
No way!
Hurry!
Is this...
I messed with the system privileges
Naomi! That's the place
of the lightning strike!
Ichigyou-san
Uhm...
Ouch!
My leg...
Damn it!
2 more minutes!
Naomi!
Sensei...
This is the end...
It ends here!
Don't worry about anything now!
Be flashy!
Yes!
1 more minute!
Don't stop!
Keep building it!
10 seconds!
You can do it
I... did it...
Yes!
Katagaki-san?
Ichigyou-san!
You are saved!
Yes! I did it!
I'm so glad
I'm glad... I did it!
Sorry!
What is going on?
Katagaki-san, Katagaki-san!
It was necessary to unite
the body with the soul
There's a gap between the physical
cranial nerve and the quantum mind
I have to get rid of it
I had to bring the mind's state
as close to the accident as possible
Sensei?
At last, the measured value has
exceeded the threshold
Now she can be
synchronized
What are you talking about?
Uhm...
Please let Ichigyou-san out
She fell in love
Fell in love with you
And now her mind...
Is almost in the same state
as when the accident happened
Now... everything is ready
She didn't die after
the lightning strike
She's brain dead
Katagaki-san!
Stop it!
Thank you
Good bye, Naomi
I missed you
Katagaki... san?
What was that thing, flying
and moving around?
Come out...
Come out!
Airplane, car or even with a bicycle
Elevator?
Stairs?
Anything!
I don't care just come out!
Just get out!
There are no sequelae so far
But regaining consciousness
from such a state...
It's a miracle
If we can use the quantum
data of the ALLTALE
A damaged brain
can recover
But the data was moved
The other side of her
is no longer there
Maybe in the house...
What's that...
[Large portion of data is corrupted here.]
[This area cannot be used.]
Open it!
Let Ichigyou-san out!
Ichigyou-san!
Let's increase the joule for the
automatic record repair!
It's already at limit
Senko-san! Shuu-san!
Naomi!
A part of the records got damaged
The cause is yet to be identified
Any idea?
I don't know the cause...
But we have bigger problems
The damaged part is
altering other records as well
If it continues like that, the
butterfly effect will exceed the threshold
If the ALLTALE
produces more failure...
It will be a chain collapse
What should we do?
It means Recovery
Recovery?
Oh, no...
[in Chinese]
Turn off the damaged
data and take it out
The repair comes after that
It's a big task.
Should we do it right away?
Yes!
I'll change clothes
Why...
Why would this...
So it's a goodbye to that
poor guy?
[Seiko Laboratory]
[Seiko Tsunehisa]
[Akiyoshi Jun - Daruman Gourmet]
[Katagaki Naomi - Newcomer!]
[Head of System Management]
[same in Chinese]
[Spinal cord injury]
We're ready for Recovery
It can't be helped, huh
Recovery
Partially erase the ALLTALE's
data and restarts after it
Do you want to free up that space?
Then, let's start it
This town...
The world...
Is being erased?
Am I...
You are the recorded past's
Katagaki Naomi in the ALLTALE
Am I...
Recorded world,
the ALLTALE'S data
Am I going to die?
Ichigyou-san
Maybe...
Somewhere...
No, it's not good!
I can't be sure that she's saved!
Just do what it says
The future is written down
According to the
Perfect Manual
[The Fair was a great success]
[I'm really happy Ichigyou-san was laughing]
I... died?
Katagaki Naomi-san
Can you... talk?
I can talk
So, I'm here to answer your questions
You are not dead
I'm your ally
Ally?
Katagaki Naomi-san
You are going to being back
Ichigyou Ruri with your own hands
Ok [in Chinese]
It's automatic from here
It's scheduled to finish
in 80 hours
And the restoration
is 1000 the time of that
The source was around the
Homeostatic System
It's in control of the ALLTALE's
huge amount of information...
The load is nothing like before...
It's like a dam wall
Shouldn't we run the maintenance
once again before we put the data back?
Hey, Naomi!
Where's him?
Katagaki-san
is at the hospital
Ahh, his love...
Ah,that's relieving to hear
When her consciousness is back...
That will be really good
Ah, that's right!
Bring back Ichigyou-san?
The world is distorted
The Homeostatic System
is for fixing distortions
It tries to erase Ichigyou Ruri
Even if you say that,
I have no power
No, you have power
Your power that you
earned through hard work
What are you...
I'm the one who watched
you through these three months
An ordinary Crow
Katagaki Naomi-san
Would you like a girlfriend?
Yes!
10 years?
You've been in a coma ever since
that lightning strike accident
It's a miracle that you woke up
During these 10 years,
I've had accidents too
Many many things have happened
But I'm glad I didn't give up
I've met you again
Do you remember?
That day...
The fireworks
Here
I've been...
I've been waiting...
That book...
That book?
It's not like that
You aren't Katagaki-san
What's that...
No way
No way that we are too...
In a recorded world?
Stop!
The goal of the system...
Is to eliminate
foreign objects
Stop! Get out right now! Hey!
Stop!!
That was...
Katagaki-san?
Ichigyou-san
Is that you...
Naomi?
Idiot...
Such an idiot...
Katagaki-san...
These guards...
Are aiming for you, Ichigyou-san
For me?
But it's okay
I'll do something
Can you get off, please?
Let's go back...
To our place
Naomi, it's serious!
I have no idea
what's goin' on!
The internal area?
The quantum record bit
got into a loop
The retained information
is just keep increasing
Almost! [in Chinese]
The logical boundary is breaking down!
Did you hear?
Anyways, come back
immediately, Naomi!
Slow
They'll catch up!
Then...
Amazing!
How far should I go?
Please go in a straight line
Distance 1.9km
There...
There it is
That's the most suitable spot for
Ichigyou Ruri's re-transfer to ALLTALE
The Grand Stairway at Kyoto Station
Do you want a ride?
Car, bike
I can't drive!
Bicycle
Want!
Like this...
The area influenced by ALLTALE
seems to increase
Within the affected area,
they can occur from anywhere
Ichigyou-san,
close your eyes
Don't leave me
I can't make in time
You can!
Get in!
Hurry up!
Please get out of here!
Why...
Return her to your
original world
It's all my fault
I...
I just wanted to see
her smile once again
To make amends
Tell me what to do, Naomi!
Kyoto Station!
To The Grand Stairway
It's still the Homeostatic System
They are recklessly trying to
halt the information increase
Emergency?
Impossible
The only way now
is to stop it directly
To stop directly?
Up!
Naomi! The road! Make uphill!
Yes!
Hey, are you stupid?
Focus!
Ichigyou-san, don't worry,
it will be fine!
We arrived
Getting ready
Your hand
Converter
It's on the
while staircase
The quantum conversion will
finish when you reach the last step
The System is
approaching this location
We need to hurry!
First, Ichigyou Ruri's
conversion...
Can you go down?
Your leg...
What is...
But...
Ichigyou-san
It's okay!
Let's do this!
Let's go!
Then, please follow me
Okay!
Hey, hurry!
What's wrong?
Are you...
Katagaki-san, right?
I'm just an ordinary extra
Then...
You...
loved me, right?
Thank you very much
Farewell
Ichigyou-san...
I...
I liked you
You did it!
Kataga-
Katagaki-san?
Hurry up, Naomi!
you are the next one!
Crap, crap!
Oh no...
Naomi!
Knock it down, Naomi!
But how...
Make something huge
An axis!
Then a jet!
Punch it out!
Can you restore the stairs?
Many pieces are broken...
It will take some time
Have to be kidding me
Professor,
are you sure it's okay?
If you stop the Homeostatic System...
The information will
infinitely increase inside the ALLTALE
Now repeat it
in Japanese
It's called The Genesis
Genesis?
The creation of a new world,
The Big Bang
Sensei, go!
That thing...
It's risky
The target is too big
It will just spread
even more
I see...
Then, what should I do?
Naomi
Sensei...
There's a way to beat that
Ah... really?
Please tell me what to do
This time use the
Good Design...
To erase me...
Huh... Why?
I don't have to explain
But, but that...
There's no other way
But... but even then, there's no
guarantee that this thing will disappear
The System tried to erase her
Instead of bringing her back,
it tried to erase her
That solves the address duplication
The ALLTALE's mind
and this world's body
The fox guards wanted to
get rid of that duplication
In other words...
If you or me...
Disappears from this word,
It will stop
It would be a disaster
if you were gone
It's already decided
No!
No! Absolutely no!
It's okay!
We can still make it!
I'll be done with this right away!
Naomi!
I'll create that converter
once again!
No...
No!
Hello, my dear
I agree, fate is absurd
No...
As Sensei said...
If I believe in it...
Hello, my dear
That I can really do anything
No!
No matter if you are in pain,
The world will laugh
We're both going to live!
Yup
You can do anything
if you believe in it
Sensei...
Sensei...
Katagaki Naomi
Be happy
She was the first person I chose
The day I lost Ichigyou-san,
I lost my future
I decided to get her back,
whatever it takes
I decided to get back our future
Our...
I'm... happy
Ichigyou-san
Katagaki-san
Katagaki-san...
Katagaki-san...
Thank you
Where should we go...
It's a new universe, isn't it?
I don't know how it is
I hope it will be
easier to live there
Katagaki-san
Did we... come back to
our original world?
Surely, we did
It's a new world that
no one knows about

Yes!
It was successful!
Finally he's awake!
I'm so glad
The body soul and the body
needs to be synced
It was because of someone special to you
At last, your mind
is synced to your body
You finally did it
Katagaki-san
Ichigyou...

I hope you enjoyed the movie ^^
The air looks thinner than usual,
as if it was fake
My sick heart always gets wet
under the never stopping rain
I never have an umbrella with me,
What am I trying to do that anxious?
I want to hurry back to you,
but the time we promised has already passed
I wish I could fly out,
do whatever I want, to scatter around
But I feel like I can't change
Well they keep on tellin’ me
At least let me love you
However
I want to love, but I can't
I don't want to endure it every day
Just do it
It doesn't matter how many times,
It doesn't matter how many times
I turn the pages of my notebook
Let's start over in fresh place
In our new world
Some day I will reach you too,
I'll keep this wish
I'm just walking brave like an idiot
While I don't even have a cape
You laughed out loud,
But suddenly that's all I needed
When the sky comes fallin’ down
From a deep, long hole
I want to touch your love
But it all changed
Why I can't go back anymore?
Why am I relived, why am I not crying?
Laugh and hug each other, even now
I want to meet you,
I want to meet you,
Talk even without voice
I love you
I don't care how many times,
I don't care how many times
It's not perfect, give us a bouquet of flowers
Fill up the whole world with that scent
The stars painting the sky with different colours,
never leaving the night sky black
Light up to break,
Reapint it to pure white once again
In that new world,
Let's hold hands every day
Doesn't matter how many times,
Doesn't matter how many times
Always, my hand
And your hand
