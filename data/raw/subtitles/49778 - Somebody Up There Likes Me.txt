Hey, Nick, why don't you
give the kid a chance?
- Come on, use your left.
- Please, Pop.
- Use your left. Come on, fight me back.
- Please.
- Please, stop.
- Come on. Cover up.
- Stop.
- Come on, use the left. Cover up.
I seen guys get more action
just shadowboxing.
- Cover up.
- Please.
Hey, Nick, why don't you
give the kid a chance?
That's for leaving yourself wide open.
What's he trying to do?
Fan his old man to death?
Rocky ain't no more a fighter
than his old man was.
Good thing Ida made you hang
the gloves up, Nick.
I don't like cry babies. Get up.
Get up.
How do you expect
to learn the kid anything, Nick?
You was nothing
but a lousy prelim fighter yourself.
All right, you no-good little bum...
...let's walk nice and quiet
down to the station house.
Let me go, copper.
Save your shoe leather.
Well, there goes another
little greaseball on his way.
Ten years from now,
the Death House at Sing Sing.
Again, Rocky?
- Hey, Ma, how'd you know I was up here?
- Like a homing pigeon.
I busted out of the protectory.
The bulls tell you?
- Me, Vinnie and Lou.
- Three times in two years.
Wait until the guys
find I'm on the lam again.
I bet the cops gave the flash to every
cop car from the Bronx to Brooklyn.
Maybe even the radio stations.
Let them try and find me.
They're not looking for you.
- What are you talking about?
- That's why the police come tonight...
...to tell me Brother Benedict's
given up on you.
They're through with you at the protectory.
"Don't come back," they said.
They're trying to fool you.
That's a trick. I'm on the lam.
- They don't want you, Rocky, but I do.
- No.
No, leave me alone, leave me alone.
- Why don't you give up on me, Ma?
- I don't know how.
I ain't no good, I never will be.
Everybody knows it.
Why don't you give up on me, will you?
Sure, maybe tomorrow.
But tonight you're gonna
get some sleep. Come.
What am I gonna do with you,
you wild no-good devil?
- Why you getting upset?
- How much you think your mother can take?
Twice she's been in the hospital,
sick with worry.
You're driving her to her grave.
Nobody can hold you, even with iron bars.
You won't go to school or to work.
Pool rooms, stealing, traveling with bums.
- Just don't worry about it, will you?
- That's all you ever say:
"Don't worry about it."
When are you gonna stop all this?
- When are you gonna be something?
- Like you, huh?
How much did you ever make?
So that I didn't have to go down
and rob bread...
...and steal coal from the blind man.
What did you ever give us around here?
Except your wine breath
and the back of your hand.
Why, you...
I look at you and I see the devil.
Get out of my sight.
- Hi, Rocky.
- Hi, Sis.
I got you some eggs for breakfast.
A celebration.
Never mind, Ma.
- Where you going?
- To be something.
Rocky.
Tomatoes. Tomatoes. Ripe tomatoes.
Hey, big man. Whose house
you gonna rob tonight, huh?
Who you gonna knock over,
huh, big man?
- Hey, Romolo.
- Hey, Rocky boy.
- When did you get home, huh?
- I didn't get home, I got out, that's all.
- Hey, what about my other shoe?
- Eat it.
Without you, I'm just nickels
and dimes, you know that?
Buddy boy, we find Fidel and Shorty
and then we make plans.
- What do you say, Fidel?
- Rocky.
- Come on.
- Hey, when did you get out, huh?
Hey, Shorty the Greek.
Come on, buddy boy, we got work to do.
Hey, what you think you're doing?
Why you stinking little...
- What are you trying to do? Get killed?
- No.
I just wanted to see
whether your brakes worked.
Hey. Hey, I think I got a bite.
Look out below.
- Fifty?
- Come again. Come on.
Seventy-five tops.
My inventory's way overloaded.
How can you split 75
four ways, huh?
- It don't come out even.
- Eighty then.
Come on.
- What are you gonna do with the money?
- Buy some clothes. What do you say?
- We don't want people to think we're bums.
- Wait a minute. Take a look.
Beautiful $ 100 suits.
For you guys, 20 bucks apiece.
Get out of here. Come on.
What are you...?
- Good morning.
- Oh, yeah, good morning.
- Breakfast.
- Oh, thanks.
- Hey, what's the program for today, huh?
- Pick up Fidel and Shorty the Greek.
Then what?
School.
- School?
- Yeah.
All my life I've been dreaming
of robbing a school.
- Thanks.
- Hey, you two. Get away from there.
- Come on.
- What do you think you're doing?
Come back here.
What do you think...?
I'll get you, guys.
How many times we gotta tell you
to stay out of Polack territory?
Nobody robs our schools but us.
The bulls. The bulls.
- I can't make it.
- Come on, jump.
Hold it, punk. Frisk him.
All right, who'd you
unload the stuff with this time?
What stuff?
Everything in the precinct
that wasn't nailed down.
- Come on, who was the fence?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about
who give you the money?
My old man give it to me.
Yeah, my old man give it to me.
Nick Barbella, huh?
Two hundred and 10 bucks,
Mr. Barbella.
If he can't account for it,
I have to put him in the lineup.
- He says you give it to him. Yes or no?
- Yeah. Yeah, Nick, you remember.
- Of course he give it to him.
- Mr. Barbella?
All I ever give him was a wine breath
and the back of my hand.
- Thanks.
- Come on.
All I could think of, Your Honor, as I walked
into the cold, gray shadows of the Tombs...
...and saw this little child crying...
Do you know that this little child once
attempted to burn down a police station?
It's against my better judgment,
but I'm gonna give him another chance.
I'm going to remand him to the custody
of his parents and the probation officers.
But this other fellow here,
his probation reports are a disgrace.
- True, Your Honor, but I thought...
- Are the parents in court?
Yes, Your Honor, the mother is here.
- Where's the father?
- He refused to come.
Rocco Barbella's been a burden
to his mother during the whole of his life.
Ever since he was old enough to run,
he was a court problem.
They remanded him
to the Catholic protectory.
Three times he broke out...
...each time to join his gang
and terrorize the neighborhood.
Something has got to be done
to save this boy from a criminal career.
He has got to know that
if he is going to commit burglaries...
...and make of himself a thief,
he cannot be at large.
I am therefore committing him to Mackinock
for an indeterminate sentence.
- No.
- Maybe they will be able to break his spirit.
- Next case.
- We'll see whose spirit gets broke.
Don't wreck the floor,
you're gonna have to sleep on it.
Shut up, you lousy screw.
You'll get over it, kid,
even if it takes 20 years.
Open 32.
- Now, what would you like for breakfast?
- Your cruddy head on a silver platter.
I'm George Niles.
Cigarette?
My men tell me you're giving yourself
a rough time here.
Maybe we ought to talk things over.
Why you... Hold it. Hold it.
All right, you licked me, Barbella.
Twenty years and I never
laid a hand on one of my boys.
Maybe you guys will learn,
ain't no place I can't lick.
Send him to the reformatory.
Get rid of him.
Come on.
- Come on, dig.
- Just one mouthful. Just one.
Dig.
- Why don't you give him a drink, geezer?
- Sure.
Sure, you have one first, huh?
- Why you...
- Start something.
Just give me an excuse.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on, let's make a break.
- Give me the gun. Give me the gun!
- Will you come on?
- Give me the gun.
- You wanna get the chair?
No. No, don't. Don't.
You ever think of putting
a glove on that lead pipe?
Not a chance.
On the outside, I owned little pieces
of two fighters. Good boys.
Sometimes they win,
sometimes they dive like swans.
- Either way, there's money in it.
- I ain't putting gloves on.
- Not for money. Not for nothing.
- Why not?
Because the only glove fighter I ever knew
was a bigger bum than I am.
Well, if you ever need quick money,
just look me up at Stillman's Gym.
- Ask for Frankie Peppo, that's me.
- Yeah, Rocky Barbella.
- I'm pleased to meet you.
- No, that's my pleasure.
Welcome to Rikers Island.
They couldn't handle you dumb
little punks at the reform school.
Well, this is no reform school.
We run a good penitentiary here,
and a tough one.
You pull here what you pulled up there...
...and our men would just as soon
put a bullet through your head as not.
- Now, you got that straight?
- Yes, sir.
You don't believe that, do you?
Thirty days in the hole.
Let him spit in the dark.
I don't know why anybody
would wanna see you, Barbella...
...but you got a visitor. Special privilege.
Come on.
Hey, Ma.
Don't worry about me, Ma.
I'm gonna have this joint licked in no time.
Why don't you ask me why I haven't
come to see you for six months?
Why don't you ask me where I've been?
County Hospital, that's where.
Tied to a bed.
Electric-shock treatment. Trying to save me
from going out of my mind.
- Ma.
- You, Rocky.
You're the one keeps me up all night
with worry, so as I can't sleep.
Going out of my mind.
I can't go on.
- Ma, cut it out. Will you stop it?
- I'm through, Rocky.
I can't fight your fights.
I can't raise my hand for you no more.
- Who you been talking to? The priest?
- What am I going to do with you, Rocky?
Don't worry, huh? Just don't worry.
All you ever say is "don't worry."
You think I talked to the priest?
Yes, I talked to the father and he
told me I'm doing the right thing.
He said nobody can help you,
Rocky, but you yourself.
That's what the father said to me.
Maybe you think I'm hardhearted,
your own mother...
...but what I'm gonna do
is the only thing I can think of.
Gonna do what?
I am the last person on Earth who cares
whether you live or die or rot in jail.
But if you turn your back on me,
and go back to that scum you call friends...
...I turn my back on you.
You are no longer my son.
Ma, I try to turn the leaf,
but I can't make it.
It's something inside of me.
I try, but I can't make it.
I pray to God you'll try.
If you don't, I'll be through.
I don't wanna be,
but I don't know what else to do.
Look, Ma, just don't worry.
Just don't worry about a thing.
Don't worry about a thing.
Don't worry about a thing.
Ma?
Ma?
You got three minutes to go.
You're gonna serve every second of it.
Anything you say, sir.
Only thing good I can say
is I'll never have to see you again.
The next time up,
you go to state or federal pen.
No, sir. There ain't gonna be
no next time. I mean, I'm all paid up.
Six years out of 10
I been in one can or another.
I'm never gonna get locked up again.
- No?
- No.
One thing you and this lousy place give me
is a big taste for being on the outside.
Definitely.
- Get out, Barbella.
- Thanks.
What do you know?
Two minutes off for good behavior.
- Rocco Barbella?
- Yeah.
Look, you guys ain't got nothing on me.
I'm clean. I'm gonna stay clean.
That's nice, because you got a date.
We're here to make sure you keep it.
Date? What are you talking about?
Barbella, you're about to volunteer
to be drafted into the United States Army.
What? Back in stir again? You're kidding.
No, we're not kidding.
Neither is Hitler.
Hey, look, I can't make it right now.
I got a little living to catch up with.
Look me up in about six months.
We talk over this Army deal again. Okay?
All right, fall in.
- Yeah, who is it?
- Corporal Quinbury.
- Am I disturbing you, Barbella?
- Well, what time is it?
Five minutes past 11.
- Well, good morning, private.
- Yeah, what do you say?
I trust you found everything
satisfactory, private?
I don't know, where do you get
something to eat around this joint?
Where were you at roll call?
Don't you know you're in the Army?
- Well, yeah, sure.
- Stand at attention and say, "Yes, sir."
Why don't you just knock it off, Mac?
Barbella, you're on permanent company
detail as long as you stay in my outfit.
You can start now by policing
every inch of the area around this tent.
Now pick up that cigarette butt.
- What did you say?
- I said, "Pick up that butt and move."
Listen, I'm running this tent
and don't forget it.
Sleeping late, staying up as late as I want,
I'm eating when I feel like it.
Now, you rat on me to the warden,
I'll bust your skull.
Pick up that butt and move.
Oh, anybody bothers you guys
just let me know, huh?
Hundreds of them. Thousands of them
marching around in circles.
Not one lousy face that I know.
Not from the East Side, not from any
can I ever been in, not from nowhere.
Never seen so many square creeps.
Come on, let's go into town, huh?
- Schmooze. Shoot pool. What do you say?
- Stop trying to get us into trouble.
What are you talking about?
You seen what I done.
No trouble so long
as I'm running this tent.
They can court-martial you
for going into town without a pass.
- What's this court-martial?
- You'll find out.
Come on, buddy boy. Let's go, huh?
Let's you and me go into town.
- We'll go into town, have a lot of laughs.
- In the first place, I'm not your buddy boy.
And second, I'm not gonna break
regulations because you want company.
Neither is anybody else.
We don't like being drafted
any more than you...
...but we got put in the Army,
we're gonna do the best we can.
- Do you think you can understand that?
- You little creep.
Go ahead. Hit me.
The only thing it'll prove is
you're a common criminal.
We know you've got a record
so go ahead, knock me out...
...if you think it'll make
you feel any better.
Here he is.
That's the one.
All right, soldier, let's go.
You sure don't seem to have much regard
for rules and regulations.
You don't have much regard for anything.
What is all this talk about rules
and training and stuff?
Put me someplace
where I can fight them Hitler soldiers.
Let's get it over with.
We ain't gonna win hanging
around this camp.
I see by your records you're from
New York City.
Yeah.
You mean, "Yes, sir."
Yeah, yes, sir.
I gather from the way
you talk and think...
...you're like a lot of the tough guys
we got coming in here.
I guess we're gonna have to knock
some of that out of you, fella.
I reckon we're gonna have to teach
you a little lesson.
I wanna tell you something now:
There's no room in this man's Army
for a wise guy.
- You understand that?
- Wait a minute, you bum.
You could be a captain and all that,
but you don't impress me so hot.
You're so tough, come on outside.
- Soldier, are you just plain crazy?
- Yeah, maybe I am.
Crazy with being sick and tired of this
creep joint, but at least I ain't yellow.
Hey, sarge?
Say, what's a nine letter word for different
methods of governing a society?
I keep getting confused.
You're in the Army now.
You've gotta forget everything
but four-letter words.
- Who is it?
- Come... It's me. Come on, open up.
Hey, Rock.
Hey, I thought you was in the Army.
What are you doing here?
- No, not 10 after 6.
- Come on, you got some scratch on you?
Me? Nothing.
A couple of bucks.
I been doing pretty lousy, Rocky.
Everybody's in the Army.
Can't get no one to muscle for me.
Hey, Rocky?
Hey, you coming back with me?
No, I got into this jam, this bad jam
with this captain out at the camp...
...and it's gonna take
dough to buy him off.
- How much?
- A couple yards, maybe a grand.
I don't know the price
but I can't go back to the Army...
...until I got what to square the rap.
- What about your old lady?
She always done pretty good for you
with them bail bondsmen.
No, she don't know I'm on the lam.
She wouldn't like it.
- Hey, what's-his-name?
- Who?
This guy, Frankie Peppo.
He said if I ever needed quick dough...
I've gotta get me some clothes first.
Hey, what size suit you wear?
- You'd split the seams.
- Knock it off, will you?
Go get me a suit someplace.
I'm gonna get some shuteye.
Get you a suit?
Rocky, I ain't got any dough.
So?
Ring One:
Ramon Santalito and Eddie O'Flare.
Look out below.
I listen to you enough.
Now you're gonna listen to me.
You're tired, huh? Course you're tired.
How many times I gotta tell you?
Either you wanna be a fighter
or you wanna have fun like Errol Flynn.
- What's on your mind?
- Where can I find Frankie Peppo?
What is this? Information, please?
Can't you see I'm busy?
Try Lou Stillman.
Come here, you.
Let me show you something.
Telephone call for Marty O'Brien
for a change.
Hey, Mr. Stillman, the floor in
the shower is very slippery.
- I almost fell and hurt myself.
- Do me a favor.
Take your showers at home
if you got a home.
- Hey, you're blocking the path.
- No, this guy said maybe you could tell me...
Max. Booth Two.
What's going on here?
Max Natfield's wanted on the phone
and that ain't all he's wanted for.
Who are you looking for?
Frankie Peppo.
Just tell me how to find him.
Sure. I'll tell you how to find Peppo.
You take a subway
down to Grand Central Station...
...and then you take
the train to Sing Sing.
But don't hurry because you got
two to 10 years to get there.
And when you do find Peppo,
tell him to stay away from here.
I'm not running a social hall for thieves.
Say, Lou, Eddie is giving me the
twisted-ankle routine.
I think his ankle isn't twisted,
it's yellow.
Well, what do you expect
for 10 dollars? Tiger-flowers?
All right, so send out a call
on WHN there.
See if you can dig me up
a sparring partner real fast.
There must be someone around
who needs a sawbuck.
Yeah. Me.
- You wanna mix with my boy?
- Yeah, sure.
- Have you done much fighting?
- Well, yeah.
- Where?
- All around.
All around with who?
What do you mean? Lots of guys.
What's your name?
- Rocky.
- Rocky what?
Graziano. Rocky Graziano.
- Like the Italian wine.
- Yeah, like the Italian wine.
You go in the locker room
and tell Chuck...
...that Irving Cohen said you should have
trunks and a head guard.
Yeah, in there.
And look, make sure
that he gives you a cup.
Oh, that's okay, Mr. Cohen,
I don't need no cup.
I'll drink out of the bottle.
That's it. Jab. Jab.
- Throw your right. That's it.
- Throw your right.
Get in close.
Get him.
Stay down.
Come here.
Come here. Do you realize
who you just knocked out?
That's the top light heavyweights
from South America.
I'm sorry, he got me mad.
I forgot where I was.
- Where did you learn to hit like that?
- Do I still get the 10 bucks?
- Sure.
- Ramon bought that jaw at Steuben's Glass.
Listen, Rocky, this is Whitey Bimstein.
- Yeah. How are you, Whitey?
- Hi.
- Like to have him train you?
- What do you mean?
Come on,
Give me my 10 bucks, will you?
Sure, sure, but you see,
I like the way you hit, kid.
And I'd like to handle you.
I ain't got time
for 10-dollar fights.
No, no, no, 50, 75, 100 dollars
a bout in no time at all.
Sure, sure.
You get another guy for me to flatten and
get ahold of me at Benny's Candy Store.
That's 10th Street by Avenue A.
If I ain't found a better way
of picking up some dough...
...l'll fight for you, okay?
Okay.
Meshuggenah.
Sometimes I think I never
should have left the lingerie business.
I was the happiest man
in ladies underwear.
Couple hundred places
where they have fights...
...and these guys
gotta go pick the Army.
Will you sit down, Rocky?
Relax a little?
Everybody's nervous their first fight, kid.
- You got nothing to worry about.
- Yeah, nothing to worry about.
Yeah. I got nothing to worry about.
You better come along with us.
All right. I'll come along with you.
Big crowd, and they got the aisle blocked.
You just follow us, we'll get you to the ring.
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh, yeah.
Let's go, Hightower.
Come on, Hightower.
Rock this baby to sleep.
Hey, Graziano, your bicycle has a flat.
Somebody introduce these guys.
Come on, Hightower.
Come on, Hightower. Let's go.
Let's go, Hightower.
What are you looking out there for?
He's right there in the ring,
right in front of you.
- Break it up.
- I gotta get out of here.
All right, move to your corner.
Yeah, yeah, I know you got
a great right hand, kid...
...but there's more than one hand
on a fighter.
You have to train.
Learn how to box a little.
Look, I ain't got time for training talks now.
Just give me the dough, huh?
Okay, kid. Okay.
Here's 40 for you and 10 for me.
Thanks.
Now, what about you and Whitey
getting together tomorrow?
No, just leave a message at the store
when you got another guy for me.
Now, wait a minute,
aren't you even gonna take a shower?
That's okay, Mr. Cohen.
It's raining out.
Hundred and fifty-five and a half.
One fifty-five and a half.
Okay, Graziano. Purple tights.
Be in the dressing room at 7:30.
Here. Take this with you.
They'll ask for it.
- Oh, yeah.
- Hundred and fifty-five.
- One fifty-five.
- See that? You faded another two pounds.
- You haven't been eating.
- What do you want from me?
I mean, I can't do any better than six
straight KO's, can I?
Yeah, tonight, lucky seven.
Look, this Gasto is a rough guy.
And this is your first six-rounder.
- He could hurt you, Rocky.
- So he hurts me.
So I get 75 bucks
because it's a six-rounder.
Look, Mr. Cohen, do me a favor, huh?
Get me hurt in a 10-rounder.
What have you been doing
with all this money?
You certainly haven't been eating good.
- A hundred and thirty-seven.
- One thirty-seven. Paxon:
White trunks. 8:00 in the
dressing room. Take this.
Look, I'll go along with you,
but please don't start no trouble.
- Who's your manager?
- Him. Mr. Cohen. He's my manager.
Have to take you along
for harboring a fugitive.
- Fugitive? I don't understand.
- No.
He don't know nothing about that.
I mean, I never told him...
...that I run away from the Army.
Well, I never told him nothing.
Not even my right name.
- It isn't Graziano?
- No, it isn't Graziano.
I guess we owe you an apology, Cohen.
Get your clothes on, Barbella.
Yeah.
- Look, Rocky, I'll go there with...
- No, no, just do one thing for me?
Sure, kid, sure.
Give this to Mrs. Barbella. Ida Barbella.
Top floor. 141 East 10th Street.
Tell her...
No, don't tell her nothing.
Just give it to her.
The accused has admitted his guilt...
...and can only hope
for the mercy of this court.
Barbella?
Well...
...I made a bad mistake, sir.
I been very stupid. Very stupid.
And I'm sorry I done what I done.
I should have known that the Army
wasn't just another can.
But too long, sir.
I mean, I've been in prison too long.
I know I can learn this Army business.
So, colonel, sir, I mean,
please just give me another crack at it.
- Is that all?
- Yeah.
Barbella, Rocco, "32201881,
private selective service, unassigned.
To the charges of being absent
without leave for four months...
...the accused is found guilty.
To the specifications: Guilty.
Upon secret ballot,
two-thirds of the court-martial concurring...
...the accused is to be
dishonorably discharged...
...from the service
of the United States...
...to forfeit all pay and allowances due
or to become due...
...and to be confined at hard labor
at Leavenworth Disciplinary Barracks...
...for a period of one year."
Inside.
Okay to lock.
Door jammed somewhere.
- Check the line.
- Check the line.
- Check the line.
- Check the line.
Clear that door.
I said, clear that door, prisoner.
Man, can't you see I'm occupied?
Heldon, I'm gonna give you
10 seconds to clear that door.
If you don't move,
you're a dead soldier.
- One, two, three, four, five, six...
- Now you cut loose with that gun.
- I'm gonna jump on you the minute you fire.
- Seven.
You and me's going over that railing
with you on the bottom.
You're gonna crack your skull
on that cement floor. You hear?
Wonder what he's in for?
Me, I'm in for shooting a second looey.
It was an accident...
...I think.
What are you in for?
For being a jerk, like him.
That's two packs you owe me.
Hey, how come you're so good,
if you never played before?
What do you mean? It's the same as
throwing bricks through store windows.
Little guy, go get me my horseshoe.
- Who? Me?
- Yeah, you.
Ain't in the mood.
Little guy, you just don't
hear so good, do you?
I said, go get me my horseshoe.
I don't wanna.
Hey, well, now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Heldon, look.
Why do you wanna make him
do something he don't wanna do?
If he don't wanna do something,
you ought to respect it, you see?
New York, you are absolutely correct.
Now, ain't he, fellas?
- Oh, sure.
- You're right, Hel.
Little guy, you don't have to get me
my horseshoe.
You do it.
Well, it's the same with me,
I don't wanna.
Well, he just don't wanna do it.
- Come on.
- Get up.
- There's your middleweight, sergeant.
- Well, it isn't over yet.
Better pull the package on him
and check his history.
I already did, sir.
He hasn't had a dull moment
since he was born.
Name's Barbella.
Fought under the name of Rocky Graziano
while AWOL.
Six bouts, six KO's. Good right, no left.
We got him for a year.
Minus the two weeks in solitary
he gets for this.
- Here he is, sergeant.
- You can leave us a while. I'll call you.
- Right.
- Barbella?
- Yeah.
- I'm John Hyland.
- Cigarette?
- Oh, yeah, thanks.
I run the boxing squad here.
Thought maybe you'd like to join.
No, thanks.
The bouts we put on do a lot for the morale
of the prisoners around here.
You could help.
Come on, what do you say?
I ain't interested in fighting.
For a man who isn't interested in fighting,
you did pretty good against Heldon.
And look where it got me, the hole.
You did pretty well
as Rocky Graziano too.
I needed the scratch.
I would have done anything.
- Even clown around in the ring.
- Six KO's, not bad clowning.
All right, look, sergeant,
all my life I been fighting.
And all my life I been
getting in trouble from it.
I don't want no more trouble.
Just leave me alone.
I don't wanna fight,
with gloves, without gloves.
- I just don't wanna fight, okay?
- Sure.
Here. Sit down.
Come on, sit down.
Rocky, I'm gonna level with you.
I wasn't thinking about
the morale of the men.
I was thinking about myself.
You see, the boxing squad
is the colonel's pride and joy.
I can do myself a lot of good
around here...
...with a killer like you on the squad.
Now, mind you, I don't think
you'd ever show any real style...
...like some of my boys,
but you'd probably lick them all...
...because you got something
inside of you...
...that a lot of fighters will never have...
...no matter how much I teach them:
Hate.
I don't know why it's there.
I only know that if anybody hits you,
he better start ducking fast.
Because that hate pours into
your right hand...
...and makes it like a...
Like a charge of dynamite.
What a great big waste of a lot of hate.
Your whole life
you've let it get you into trouble.
Let it start
doing some good for you.
Oh, yeah?
What good is it gonna do for me?
I mean, what can it do
for a dishonorable discharge?
Can it get me back in the Army?
No, I'm afraid it's too late for that.
I'm sorry, Rocky...
...because I think you might have fought
a pretty darned good war.
Got any ideas of what you're gonna do
when you get out of here?
None of you guys ever do.
You walk out of a prison
as dumb as you go in...
...itching for the same trouble
that put you there in the first place.
Let me give you an alternative.
Join my squad and I'll put you through
a year of the worst hard labor...
...you ever sweat through.
I don't mean just skipping rope...
...and clowning
through exhibition bouts.
You'll dig ditches and carry bags of cement
till your back nearly breaks.
You'll curse me for it.
But when you get out...
...you'll be in the best shape
of your life.
And maybe, just maybe,
you might have learned enough...
...to get by in one of the toughest
rackets there is.
Oh, be a fighter, Rocky.
A professional fighter.
You were doing pretty good,
we'll do better.
Make that hate
work for you inside the ring...
...where it'll make a living for you.
Instead of outside the ring where
it'll just go on lousing up your life forever.
Who knows...
...it may work so many miracles
you might even lose that hate some day.
Is that bad?
Maybe you'd rather go on
spitting in your own face...
...for the rest of your life.
A year in the Army
didn't hurt him none.
Boy, I haven't seen anybody in such
good shape since I was selling girdles.
But he's got a lot to learn yet.
Yeah, we gotta learn him
not to kill anybody.
Seven, eight, nine...
...10.
I think I'll take a walk.
If Mr. Bimstein knows so much,
why don't he teach you how to duck?
What are you talking about?
Besides, it matches my shirt real good.
Anyway, look, folding money.
Mac Wade folded in the second round.
Come on, come on, come on.
I'm gonna get some ice cream.
And stand on the street corner
taking bows...
...from the whole neighborhood,
Mr. Jack Dempsey?
Oh, gamine, gamine,
how many times I gotta tell you?
- He's a heavyweight.
- Heavyweight, middleweight...
...so long as they can't put you
in jail for it.
Hey, Pa. Hey, what do you say?
Took him in two.
For what?
So I can wind up
with a breath like a winery.
Spend my life picking up butts
out of the gutter.
- For what?
- He didn't get that way being a fighter.
He got that way not being a fighter.
Remember that.
Who knows what he might have become
if he hadn't had the bad luck to find me.
What are you talking about?
It was so easy for him
to think he was in love with me.
I was the one thing in his whole life
that wasn't dirty and nasty...
...and hitting him in the face
with a glove.
So, what did I do?
"Give it up, Nick.
Stop being a fighter. I won't marry you."
Did I know fighting was in his blood,
like dope, so it kills him when he quits?
Don't blame him, Rocky. It's me.
Me, your mother who keeps telling you
what to do.
Come on, Ma, come on.
What are you doing, huh?
Cheer up, will you? I mean...
You'll see,
everything's gonna be okay, huh?
Don't worry about a thing.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay, I'll see you later.
- Hello, Rocky.
- Oh, hi, Sis.
Rocky, this is my girlfriend Norma Unger
from Brooklyn.
Norma, this is my brother, Rocky.
- Hello.
- Well, yeah, hello.
- Rocky.
- What?
- Where you going?
- I'm going down to the candy store.
Norma's just dying to meet you,
but she's kind of shy.
Well, she just met me.
Well, I thought that maybe
we could double-date sometime.
Palmer, throw me down the key.
Sis, don't worry about a thing.
I mean, just leave me alone.
I ain't got no time for giris.
- Hi, Rocky.
- What's new?
What are you doing, huh?
Hey, Benny.
Hey. It's says here
I'm a "promising young middleweight."
How about that?
Everybody who is young is promising.
The worid should sue the young
for breach of promise.
Give me another one.
Eating and drinking are inadequate
substitutes for achievement.
Gas in the belly, unfortunately,
will not inflate the ego.
Must have said something
real smart, Benny...
...because I didn't understand a word.
- I've always been a very wise man, Rocky.
I'm not exactly
what you may call a philosopher...
...but I know what I'm talking about.
When I graduated night school,
the class voted me the man most likely...
...to own his own candy store.
Something to drink, young lady?
I'm not exactly thirsty.
A nice Swiss-cheese sandwich, perhaps?
I'm not exactly hungry either.
Salami? Pastrami?
A hot corned-beef sandwich?
- No.
- Can I interest you in a cigar?
Could you tell me
how to get to Deager Street...
...in Brooklyn, by subway, I mean?
Three blocks north, four blocks west.
The BMT station.
Take the Brighton Express to Kings Highway
and the bus to Ocean Parkway.
Or else, walk to 14th St.,
take Canarsie Line...
...or the 8th Avenue Subway.
Take the E train to 4th Street...
...then the D train to Kings Highway,
and the bus to Ocean Parkway.
Any questions?
Thank you, I'll find it somehow.
- Good night.
- Anytime.
Good night, Rocky.
Oh, yeah, good night.
I'll see you.
The check.
Hey, wait up.
I'll walk you down
to the subway entrance.
You don't have to do that.
Well, it's raining.
No, it's not, it stopped.
Maybe it'll start up again.
Come on.
Well, good night, Rocky.
Oh, yeah, good night.
Hey.
Hey, I thought I better wait with you
on the platform until the train comes.
You don't have to do that.
What do you mean? I mean...
...you shouldn't take no chances
in subway stations after midnight.
What kind of chances?
Well, you just shouldn't, that's all.
Do you want a stick of gum?
Okay.
Here.
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, it's my pleasure.
Well, good night, Rocky.
Yeah, good night.
L... I'd better ride you out to Brooklyn.
You don't have to do that, Rocky.
What do you mean? You don't wanna be
alone on a subway this late.
But the train is crowded with people.
Well, suppose they all get off
at the next stop?
Well... Come on.
Well...
...good night, Rocky.
- Oh, yeah, well...
...I better see you to the door.
- I always forget my key. I'll have to buzz.
- No, I'll buzz.
- What's the number?
- 3B. Right there.
It don't say Unger,
it says Levine.
Yes, that's my stepfather.
My mother married again
since we came over here.
- That's why it says Levine.
- Oh, you a Jewish girl, huh?
Yes.
Why? Does that make any difference?
No. Are you kidding?
Thanks for walking me
to the subway entrance.
Oh, yeah, take it easy, kid.
Will you call me or something?
Oh, yeah.
I mean, I suppose so.
I don't know. I mean, you know,
fighters ain't got much time for giris.
May I kiss you?
No, you mustn't.
Oh, darling, darling.
Have I ever told you
how much I love you?
You been telling her for two hours,
you creep.
I'm so frightened, David.
Of what, Alice?
Loving you too much...
... and losing you too soon.
- That will never be.
- Let's get out of here.
- I wanna see the rest of it.
- Come on.
- But when you're not here...
- I am always with you.
It's not just this time,
it's every movie we see.
Every time anyone kisses anyone
or says, "I love you"...
...you moan, groan, squirm.
- It's for the birds.
This whole love business.
Guys try to score with dames
just to feel big.
What do you do to feel important?
- Come see me fight sometime.
- I told you, no.
That's what makes me feel important.
You gotta be there.
You gotta hear them crowds
screaming my name.
Screaming for me
to kill off the other guy.
They grab at me when I go by.
That's what makes me feel important.
I can't stand seeing people hurt.
Especially you.
- All that blood.
- Well, look, at least you could come...
...to the gym and see me train sometime.
I mean, just train.
I won't have to see men
hurting each other?
Scout's honor.
For six months I can't get him to train...
...and then
when he should be resting...
...he trains.
He's a meshuggenah.
Hey, hold it.
- Who is next in Ring 2?
- Hey, that's her. Come on.
Hey, Lou. Hey, that's her.
That fine, nice-looking girl
is interested in you?
