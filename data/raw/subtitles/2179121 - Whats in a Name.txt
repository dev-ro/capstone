(Orchestra music begins)
(Engine noise
mixes with the orchestral music)
(Vincent's voice)  The man, who appears
out of the darkness of the tunnel, 
 is called Jean-Jacques. 
 Jean-Jacque's lucky.
He is not superstitious. 
 He can walk under a ladder,
he can accept invitations on Friday 13th
 or encounter a black cat
without even thinking about it. 
 And that's good. 
 For on this first Saturday in October
Jean-Jacques does not go just anywhere. 
 He drives to Impasse Bertholon 15A 
 in 9th Arrondissement of Paris. 
By a mysterious conincidence,
if coincidences exist at all, 
 Jean-Jacques, on his way there, 
will pass St. Lazare, Opera, Gare du Nord,
even Pigalle,
 and thus pass through a real hell. 
 First he must pass through Rue La Bruyere, 
named after a famous
French author, 
 who died of a stroke, lonely, 
poor and abandoned. 
 Then he takes Rue Lamartine, 
 another great French writer, 
who died of a stroke, lonely,
poor and abandoned. 
Then Jean-Jacques turns into
Rue Hippolyte Lebas, 
 the architect, who designed the
prison Petite Roquette, 
 which came to notoriety. 
 Behind these walls those condemned
to death were waiting for their execution. 
(Blade of a guillotine falls)
 Then he follows Rue des Martyrs, 
 of the martyrs, which is fortunate because
it leads him to Rue St. Georges, 
 which, himself a famous martyr,
first scalded, 
 was then skinned like a tomato, 
 then quartered, whacked
and finally beheaded. 
 Who could blame him, 
 when Jean-Jacques at his arrival
in Rue Impasse Bertolon, 
 a little-known physicist, 
 -- he was in one of his early
experiments struck by lightning --, 
 so when Jean-Jacques
in this macabre route 
 sees a bad omen
and could be tempted, 
to turn around on the spot? 
 But that would be a mistake, because he
had not had the chance 
 to discover this little street,
where in the thicket behind the 
 the plants lovingly tended by the owners
 barely discernible hides the famous door
with the number 15A. 
 He would not have climbed up
be the 5 floors, 
wouldn't have cleaned his feed
on the horsehair mat, 
 a souvenir of a trip to Turkey, 
 he would have missed the family dinner
that will take place here. 
-  Right here. .
- (Door bell rings)
 I.e. if someone opens. 
(The bell rings again)
- Good day. 42.90, please.
- Yes? Please what?
2 Classic and a calzone.
14.50, A Classic?
What do you put on it?
- Truffles?
- No, ham and mushrooms.
And that costs 14.50?
Do you have any idea...
These are still 95 francs!
- Sh...
- What do you think?
That I have golden water taps
or zebra skins?
- I do not know, Monsieur ...
- Shall I tell you something?
In a country
with 3 or 4 million unemployed
Demanding 250 Francs for
3 lukewarm pizzas - that's indecent.
- Disgusting if you prefer!
- (Elizabeth) What's the matter?
Guess how much he wants for his Classic.
- Have you ordered pizza?
- No, why?
Why do you open then? No wonder
if Polo escapes again.
- You haven't ordered pizza?
- He rings, I open.
I'm just civilized.
I've looked everywhere. They must
be in your study.
I checked it there!
(Door slams shut)
That guy's nuts.
(Ringing again)
The 15 is one down.
Here is 15A. Goodbye.
 Elisabeth Garaud-Larchet
is a French teacher 
 Gymnasium Paul Valery in Vincennes,
treasurer of the theater club 
 and responsible for the performance
at the end of the school year. 
 She is also an active member in
the union 
 whose principles
she has made her own. 
 Separation of church and state,
justice, solidarity. 
He leaves Paris at 1645 ... ... Thomas,
do you write a text message to Moliere?
 In continuous action
against the plight of education 
 Elisabeth never gets
to change her sweater. 
Neither  Monday 
 nor Tuesdays, 
 also not Wednesdays. 
 Well, Friday
anyway she has no classes. 
 For her the decline of
the education system is not inevitable. 
 And so every day is a new fight. 
- (Cheers)
- What is this? Stop it now!
Are you crazy, you 2? Are you nuts?
Are you crazy, Moira?
On the spot to the director,
and that is both of you!
 Occasionally doubt
gnaws at Elisabeth 
 when the thinks about the future of
public institutions. 
Valentin, your cap.
 In a disenchanted world,
reigned from selfishness, 
 Elisabeth shuns no confrontation. 
- And he did not even appear in music!
- I think he's interesting. He's got something.
Wake up, Elizabeth!
He's a bummer.
No, Mathias, you're wrong.
He is making progress.
- He has an average of 5.
- And earlier almost 6!
Do you change or do you 
keep wearing this?
Oh, shit,
who dug in here again?
 Pierre Garaud
is a professor of literature at the Sorbonne, 
 expert about the topic of the Renaissance. 
 He makes all honor to 
the French university, 
 and that thanks 
to his unspeakable humor. 
This is not more complicated
than the differentiation of a Asyndetons
from a parataxis.
Isn't that true, Monsieur Bertrand?
(All laugh)
 Extravagant, in his forties,
hero of his students, 
 Pierre wears his corduroy
like a second skin. 
 This is the suit for Monday,
the brown one, which he likes best. 
For Tuesdays, blue
with a slight surplus anthracite. 
And the one for Wednesday, a Havanna tone,
not to be combined easily. 
 As star author of the series 
"Critical Guidelines" 
 Pierre is just too happy 
to stay in contact with his readers. 
And like before every new literature season
appears to him the question, 
 whether this year, finally,
he will be able to break
 this legendary record of 527 copies sold 
 about Pyrrhonism and Montaignismus, 
which enormous success brought him to lectures
even to Moscow. 
(Speaks Russian, students laugh)
 In short, just as
his spiritual rolemodel Montaigne, 
 Pierre is mainly
one tireless seeker. 
- Polo, what are you doing?
- Whew ...
- (Pierre) You found them?
What a mess.
 For all their differences,
despite all their weaknesses, 
-  that are also strengths sometimes ... 
- And? Got them?
No, but your
Savoy bell.
Oh, where have I put it?
 ... Elisabeth and Pierre love each other.
Mondays, Tuesdays ... 
- If this was Mary, she will be suspended.
- Yes.
 ... and all the other days, too. 
(Jerome Rebotier & Debra Reynolds:
"Hello My Darling")
(Phone rings)
Oh, gee, my semolina!
- Do you take it?
- No, you go!
- It's for sure for you.
- I've my hands in the semolina!
("Hello My Darling"
in the background)
It for sure is for you again.
I have my the hands in the semolina!
Hello?
Good evening, Francoise.
 Francoise. This is Francoise Larchet,
the mother of Elizabeth and Vincent, 
 a lively, elegant woman 
 with a knack
for tasteful interior. 
 A woman with a beautiful dark
voice, a little talkative. 
Really, just incredible!
-  Well, quite garrulous .
- You have to really go there, Pierre.
- Oh, well, yes.
-  Granted, very talkative .
 After the loss of her husband
many were worrying about her a lot. 
But this  Mitterand follower of
the first hour has gotten up again 
 and also gained the admiration of
her her biggest doubters. 
 Francoise has turned her back to Paris 
 to dedicate herself entirely to painting. 
 And here in her garden in La Castide
in the heart of the Alpilles 
 she has recovered her zest for 
life. 
I'll give her to you. Be hugged, Francoise.
(Shouts) Babou! Your mother!
The Harissa, what do you think,
paste it into the sauce or separately?
- Does Anna eat hot?
- What do I know? She eats nothing!
Mama, everything's well?
With your Couscous,
do you put the raisins in before or ...
You give quite some oil into the pot,
then comes the Couscous ...
I know that. Just tell me
when the raisins ...
(Unintelligible phone voice)
Too soon everything swells,
to late it fall together.
Fine. Thank you, I hug you.
Yes, kiss kiss.
(Unintelligible)
- Ah, the Rozenthals are there?
-  Yes .
- And him? His hip? All good?
-  Yes .
- And Suzie, is she well, too?
-  Well ... 
And the dog?
Holy shit.
Among the lawn mower?
Oh ... He buys German products?
Not particularly vindictive.
Anyway, they have brought gifts
for the children as well.
 The children, that are Melodie, 12 years,
and Apollon, 4 years. 
 Melodie is lean,
intelligent, subtle. 
 Marked from an indefinable longing, 
 that surrounds her like a secret and
assures her of Pierre's admiration. 
Dad, don't you think that Emma Bovary
is completely neurasthenic?
Well, yes. Completely.
And don't you think,
that Tom-Tom maintains an oedipal relationship
to Madame Dubouchon?
Absolutely, yes.
 Apollon loves to dress up, 
 Playmobil
and the tennis player Amelie Mauresmo. 
 He was potty trained very late, 
 giving him a series
of Wednesday sessions 
 at a well-known
Child psychologists, 
 whom Elisabeth liked a lot 
-  and Pierre immediately hated .
- What a moron!
I, uh, Mam ... Oh!
(Francoise keeps talking)
Yes, yes, yes.
Ah!
Oh, really?
- What are you doing?
- I try to distract myself.
This frees the mind
and at once, hop! there comes the idea.
If you want to distract yourself,
help getting the table ready.
Nothing, I've talked to Pierre.
Yes, they come to dinner with Claude.
Oh, no, you don't disturb, Maman.
But ... But as I say ...
But I asked you for it, 
Maman!
Don't worry to call again, I ...
Exactly! All right, talk to you.
- (The doorbell rings)
- Maman, there they are. I kiss you!
 Is it that late already? What time
is it then? Oh my God.... 
She's so afraid to bother us
that she actually ends up disturbing.
Your mother.
- Ah, salut, Pierre!
- How are you?
I did not know what we'll have,
therefore RosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©.
Babou conjures a Moroccan buffet.
Perfect,
then he acts as Sidi Brahim.
Ah, no, dear Boulaouane.
The Sidi Brahim
is an Algerian wine,
Wine of the underground movement.
A wine that is colonial.
(Sniffing)
Hm! This smells heavenly good.
 Claude Gatignol, 
 first Trumpet of the Philharmonia Orchestra
at Radio France. 
 Libra, Libra ascending.  
 Claude is a copy of
his star sign. 
 Of gentle, balanced mind. 
For Claude  life seems
to be a single promise. 
 Not a day goes by without him
being delighted by some small thing. 
 The perfect water temperature, 
 the quiet hiss of the steam iron
on a silk shirt 
 or the fragrant scent
of a homemade plum souffle. 
 A happy man therefore, 
of fine humor, 
 which can be better described 
 through what he is not. 
Cuckoo!
 Claude is not quick-tempered,
he is not capricious, 
 he is not insincere. He is ... 
 not. Sort of. 
Ha! Ha! Look at me!
There are a few highlights in there, right?
You recognize everything.
- It fits you incredibly well.
- Nice of you. Pierre doesn't like it.
- That's not true.
- Oho ...
Since one can think, Elizabeth
and Claude are true friends. 
 Specifically, since the
Ballet lessons with Madame Derveau. 
 Claude was the only boy. 
 Since that time
the two have been inseparable. 
 Whether summer or autumn,
whether winter or spring, 
 their unwavering friendship
is always in season. 
... We met again.
 His great empathy 
makes Claude a man onto whose
shoulder you want to cry. 
 He has the rare ability to listen,
without judging, 
 as if he could read in a soul
like in a book. 
(Pierre) What did you play today?
BartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³k. The Concerto for Piano ...
What are you doing there?
Babou lost the key for the cellar.
Is there particular urgency
to find them?
It drives me crazy,
if I do not know where they are.
All right. What do I get if I find them?
My eternal gratitude.
- Oh! Well then ...
- (Pierre laughs)
The children?
- In bed.
- Oh!
- (Elizabeth) How was Marseille?
- Ah, surprising.
- They offered me a job.
- What? Down there?
Yeah, sure. Unavoidably.
- Their trombone drowned.
- (Laughter)
- But you're not going to accept it?
- I do not know. Maybe.
- What do you mean "maybe"?
- I'll think about it.
- I'm against it.
- Babou!
- It is far away.
- No, it's very close.
You've said the same
when you went to Toronto.
But that's
a totally different distance!
- I don't think so.
- 3 hours by train ...
Daniel Ostria and his wife, they moved
to Bourgival. Never seen again!
- Which is not necessarily a loss.
- (The men laugh)
Babou! Nothing is 
yet decided. OK?
I imagine Marseille to be quite nice.
And you wouldn't be far from La Castide.
- Francoise will be happy.
- Well, I hope so.
(Phone rings)
Hello?
The door codes are the same
for 10 years. Already forgotten?
Bad luck.
Then we just eat without you.
Vincent.
(Phone rings again)
Oh well, I'll give you a hint.
The 1st Code is "Marignan".
Yes, exactly.
The 2nd "Austerlitz".
Vincent, I beg you, Austerlitz!
"Cher" and "Hautes Alpes".
No, "Cher", the Department,
not the singer.
Well, I have mercy.
1805th
(Fanfare)
 May I introduce?
The irresistible, 
 and the one and only 
 Vincent Larchet. 
son of Francoise,
brother of Elizabeth, 
best friend of Pierre,
childhood friend of Claude. 
tennis player at the highest level,
passionate golfer. 
 Vincent is a man
of extremely appealing stature, 
 especially in his skin-tight T-shirt
of black lycra. 
 After leaving middle school with distinction
Vincent became a broker. 
 Realtor.
A formidable businessman, 
- but of distinct politeness .
- Thank you!
 This embodiment of elegance
and modesty racing through life 
 like a train in the night,
like a puma in the jungle, 
 like a rocket through space,
always ready to plunge into the water. 
 Vincent
believed his life was mapped out 
 until that memorable Sunday,
August the 15th, 
 where his fate
should falter. 
- And the right of way?
- Only a man can say that.
- Vincent Larchet.
- Anna  Caravati .
 It hit both of them like lightning. 
And soon
Anna will give a child to Vincent. 
So Vincent Larchet, some kind of hero
of modern times, in a word ... 
Shit, get yourself an elevator.
- I!
- Salut, you ignoramus.
- All's fine?
- Yes.
'85 Cheval Blanc!
- Damn it! Thank you.
- Gladly. It's a giveaway.
- Pour it into the carafe immediately.
- Well, yeah.
I did not know
that we should dress up.
And I did not know
you're a comedian.
Missing only the napkin on your arm,
then you can serve use.
- Where the big one?
- In the kitchen.
But we won't have this
Moroccan stuff again?
No.
- Do you know where the carafes are?
- (Sighs)
- Where they have been standing for 10 years.
- Ah!
Boy! A '85 Cheval Blanc!
Yes, unbelievable!
Giveaway.
- The Children?
- In bed.
- 8:14pm. Right, yeah, it's Saturday.
- Well ...
Well, that you do not know
when Austerlitz has been ...
Friedland, Jena, well, forgiven.
But Austerlitz!
Why should I know the the Metro stations
by heart?
- I own a car.
- (Laughter)
- Can I park there?
- You're risking a ticket.
- Do they tow away?
- I do not think so.
To move your battleship
they are going to need a tank.
- Do you have comprehensive insurance on your Scenic?
- Yes.
Great. I scarred a red car
and left your number.
- Did you say, my number?
- Yes, that's ok, is it?
Yes, well done.
It's my pleasure to sue you.
Ha! I wish you much pleasure.
Must be convenient actually,
an offroad car in the 5th Arrondissement.
Just take Mount St. Genevieve, and
the BiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨vre is flooded often certainly.
No off-road car.
If you are precise, it's an SUV.
"Sport Utility Vehicle".
A "cross-over", if you will.
No, I will not.
Too many Anglicisms.
Not so bad here.
That was a really good deal.
For that I'll get you easily 9,000 per square meter. 
Even without an elevator.
(Pierre) Ha! Back then you said
that only junkies and immigrants live here.
That was true. This is the advantage
of you left-wing radicals.
You dare
and invest in districts with potential.
What are you doing? May I join?
We are looking for Pierres cellar key.
Ah. And what is the reward for the finder?
- His eternal gratitude.
- In that case I join.
- Do you read in Russian?
- I've started again.
- And I'm learning Italian again, too.
- Is that true?
Yes. I look at the games on RAI.
- (Both laugh)
- You could greet me at least.
Your husband has
obliged me to a treasure hunt.
- Where is Anna?
- She's coming later.
- Meeting with the Japanese.
- Ah.
- Looks good, the new hairstyle.
- Nice of you.
- Pierre can not stand it.
- That's not true!
And? Wasn't Anna 
at the ultrasound today?
Ah ...
What's up? Why are you looking like that?
Well ... There is good ...
and bad news.
What?
The good thing is, it's a boy.
The bad news is, he's dead
(Shocked sounds, then silence)
I got you fooled.
It's a boy and he's fine.
Ha! And how well!
Look at my son!
- This miracle!
- Are you crazy? This is not funny!
- Yes, it's funny. Look there!
- One does not make any jokes about this!
- Give it to me!
- Show me.
- Hach! My nephew!
- Don't do that again.
Oh! So young and already so rich.
- Let me see.
- You're nuts, idiot!
- Oh la, la, oh la la.
- What? What's going on?
- He tends to the right, like his father.
- Shut up, you!
Did you already tell Francoise?
Ah, yes, that is no, I tried, but
it was always busy.
Speaking Maman,
We should contact her regarding La Castide.
- She wants to know exactly when you're coming.
- What do I know?
How can you know that
8 months in advance?
Oh, listen. You come simply
when it suits you.
So, we are there with the children
between July 5th and 20th.
Then Maman takes care of them
from 20th to August 6th.
And Michelle and Christelle
get there the weekend of 8/9
So, come when you want.
Between the 11th and 12th?
You can also come
when we are there.
Yes, yes, yes. No, thank you.
- Oh.
- Oh, come on.
You don't have to fix it.
Tell her about when.
Then on the weekend of 36./37.
(Elizabeth) Oh, Vincent!
Why does she care? She's there anyhow 
all the time. Always the same story...
Maybe she wants to invite 
Friends.
She has the whole winter
- to see their friends.
- That she does.
The Rozenthals
used to come in the first week of September,
and Uncle Hector in the 2nd.
There you go. I do not know when I
go there, I just know when not to.
(Laughs softly)
All right. Let's wait for Anna
or do we start?
Keep some cigarettes for her 
and she is happy.
What, she smokes?
What can I say?
She is the only woman that I know,
that starts smoking 
during pregnancy.
- It's called prenatal stress.
- (Elizabeth) I'm not mean to pry,
but ... this is poison for your son.
Please tell her when she comes.
- He may remain so small.
- Then he will become a jockey.
(Whinnying laugh)
(Claude) Really a comedian.
We did not know
which gender would get out.
After all, you knew which one got in.
We hesitated, but in the end we 
wanted to keep a little secret.
One should not know everything,
otherwise you miss too much.
I think the more you imagine
the more you fantasize
and thus complicates the encounter
with the real child.
And your psychoanalyst,
what does he say?
He says that the human race
for thousands of years got itself surprised.
The 3rd child Babou can
then bear in the forest,
with a piece of wood
between the teeth.
Au, stop it! Taking it seriously,
so what do you tell your students?
- The buffet is open.
- A little space please!
- Ah! What are you getting us there?
- No, what do you serve us?
- (Claude) Ah yes.
- Oh, man, you're demanding.
- Hurry up. 
- Take the books down there.
- Be careful with the bound ones.
- Right on.
So, I have to tell you.
- Claude, you bring the pita bread please?
- Yes, ma'am.
So, these are halloumi sticks
with parsley,
a Pastilla Tchoutchouka,
Zaalouk, an eggplant-Tatar,
a small carrot salad,
with cumin.
- I hope it tastes good to you.
- (Vincent) That's disgusting.
(Elizabeth) One does not say "disgusting"
one says "I do not like it."
(Vincent) "One" says what he wants,
I say "disgusting".
(Elisabeth) Ok. And that's hummus.
Go for it, 
I have put something aside for Anna.
- (Vincent) It soothes me.
- Do you think it is not enough?
- It depends.
- Have you invited Claude's orchestra?
If she does not cook for an army
she thinks it's too little.
So listen. When we were little,
there was never enough. I just make up for it.
You would think
we were Biafran children!
- Oh! He defends his beloved Mama.
- No, it's true! Honestly!
So, you've already got an idea
what his name will be?
- Yes!
- (All) Ah!
- We even have a fairly accurate.
- Oh!
- Which is?
- You have to guess.
- No.
- Yes!
Not so! You surely want to
wait for Anna.
Who knows when she'll come. Come on, guess!
I just hope that you do not call him
Henri, just like Dad and Grandpa.
- Oh, no, certainly not.
- I guess
you take something ... classic.
Matthew or Paul.
No. It is not an apostle.
Paul isn't one either.
Paul is not an apostle?
- No, not one of the 12.
- What is he? Substitute?
We should go after his preferences,
what he likes.
Too bad that "Rolex" is not a first name.
(Laughter)
You idiot.
With what shall we start?
Cheval Blanc or Fontaine de Provence?
It depends. Want to drink it
or descale a machine?
- Oh, how charming to Claude.
- Ah, he has musical talent,
- He can not have everything.
- Hmmm, Christoph!
- Much rarer.
- Camille.
- No. It's a boy.
- Camille is for girls and boys.
I want a name for boys and boys.
- So then Lancelot.
- No.
- Thadeus.
- No.
- Caesar.
- No!
- Basil.
- No, no.
- Igor?
- Less Russian.
- Bartholomew.
- No.
- Balthasar.
- No.
- Give us a hint!
- No.
- Come on, give a hint.
- No.
- Come on! A little hint!
- Ok, because I'm nice,
I give you one.
It starts with "A".
(All) A. ..
- Anatol.
- No.
- Mmm ...
- Alexander.
- No.
- Albert! Arthur!
- Alban, Agnan, Artemus.
- No, these aren't names!
- Aurelio!
- Anton!
Oh! Aurelio we had also considered
But then we found
Aurelio Garaud, there is too much "o".
- That's fair to say.
- Mmm! Oh, it's so delicious.
You can expect that for 
500 per bottle.
- 500 what?
- Pesetas, stupid.
500?
What do you think?
That's not a sacramental wine!
Then I'd be more in the church.
- So, where were we?
- At "Aurelio Garaud".
Exactly.
We nearly called ours like that.
- Good, but wrong. Next.
- Aymeric?
Mmm, more familiar.
- Antoine?
- More original.
- Albator.
- Oh! Are you crazy?
- Alphonse?
- Ah!
- Not bad!
- Yes!
- Is it Alphonse?
- No.
Oh ...
- But there is something to it.
- Well, then wait.
Alphonse ... Fonce ... Once ...
Nonce!
- Nonce?
- I said, "A".
Annonce!
- (Peals of laughter)
- First letter is an "A".
All right. I must look after my couscous.
You're waiting for me, yes?
- Not so easy.
- Oh, no.
- Anicet.
- That's terrible.
Stop it! You shall wait for me!
- Asterix?
- (Laughter)
Though, you're not completely off.
There is a literary reference.
- Ah, Aramis!
- No.
- Arsene.
- No.
A famous fictional character? D'Artagnan.
Get out.
- Aragon.
- No, not a last name.
- Oh, yes.
- Anatole?
- No. No.
- Alain?
- Abbas.
- Are you nuts?
(Laughter)
Amphitryon.
Oh, I can think of nothing more.
You are whimps.
So, you're giving up?
Yes, we are at and end with our Latin. 
Come on, tell us. What is it?
Adolphe.
Ha! Very funny! But seriously,
what's his name?
(Chuckles) Adolphe.
You're not going to call him Adolf?
- I will.
- (According embarrassed)
You are not calling him Adolf?
Why not? I will.
You want to call him Adolf?
Ah, yes. As the figure
in the novel by Benjamin Constant.
You're not going to call your son
Adolf! You do not mean that.
Of course I'm serious.
Besides Julien Sorel
it is the most famous name
in French literature.
The romantic hero par excellence. Or?
Vincent, you don't do that.
You ... you are kidding.
Hm? Admit it, it must be a joke.
A tasteless one, but a joke.
You surely won't call your son
like Hitler.
But no, in no case,
not like Hitler.
You know yourself, the Adolf
of Hitler is spelled with "f".
However my 
French Adolphe, with "ph".
- But that's the same thing.
- "F" and "ph" are the same thing?
I thought a professor would be a little
more familiar with the spelling.
No, it's the same for the ear.
"Adolf, "Adolphe"! Sounds equal!
Vincent, Pierre' wants to say
that people don't hear the "ph" at the end.
You hear "Adolf", you know,
with "f" as in "elefant".
Nice when you talk to me
like to a moron.
Excuse me,
but you have to be mentally deficient,
if one does not get that one cannot
call his child like that. Adolf!
Stop yelling at me!
If you want to, I'll explain.
Otherwise we change the subject.
- Listen, Vincent, that's. ..
- Pierre, Pierre! Let him explain it.
I read this novel.
The novel by Benjamin Constant.
And Anna also.
When we first met.
We loved this book!
We loved this character.
That was the book of our meeting!
So we said, if we get
a girl, let's call her Eleanor.
- And if we'll get a boy ...
- That idiot is serious about it!
He reads a book,
one book in his entire life,
- And then it has to be this one!
- You've given it to me.
Since when do you read all of a sudden
what I give to you?
Achilles! I'm sure, Achilles!
What's going on?
You said it. You said it,
when I was not there!
- Achilles, huh?
- No, Babou, it is not Achilles.
You said it.
You're mean, Vincent.
I asked you to wait.
- That's not the problem.
- Yes, of course. You can talk.
- Your brother ...
- I don't want to know any more.
- Babou, that ..
- No, I do not want to know.
- He wants his son ...
- You did not want to wait.
- Then not.
- You want to know it?
- No.
- I'll tell you anyway.
Then I won't listen.
(Sings out loud and wrong)
- Babou, stop it.
- (Keeps singing)
Babou.
- (Keep on singing oblique)
- (Pierre) That's it, Babou.
Now we understand why the Bedouins
eat without their wives.
Adolf! Are you listening?
- ADOLPHE!
- (Singing stops abruptly)
- What?
- Adolphe!
He gives him the name
Adolphe Caravati-Larchet.
- Ah, no.
- So, what now?
Did you think it over?
No. He just gets
no double name.
Just Larchet. I'm
against this ridiculous trend.
So then you consider Garaud-Larchet
ridiculous?
A bit, yes.
Ha. He calls his son Adolf
and is speaking of a ridiculous trend.
But my name is Vincent Larchet. Point.
I do not know why my son should be called
Caravati-Larchet.
If this continues, our business cards weigh
600 grams after three generations.
In Spain and Portugal ...
Who cares about Portugal!
He wants to name his son Adolf!
I give a damn,
what's coming after!
Why are you so aggressive?
Your brother wants his son
to be call like the "FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hrer"!
And I'm the one
who is aggressive. Yeah, right.
Is that true? You really want to call him
(whispers) Adolf?
The 100th time, my son
will be called Adolphe, with a "ph".
You will not do this to him!
Imagine that in school!
And then he is so young!
- Oh, Babou, now give me a break.
- How should his teacher address him?
Well, with his first name.
With the best of intentions, I couldn't.
Well, as a teacher, who knows, maybe.
But as his aunt,
absolutely impossible.
So, no, I could never say
A. .. Ad ... f ..
(Haws)
Dinner's ready, A. .. d .. f ..
A. .. d .. f ..
It's not coming over my lips. Ts!
No, no, no. I'm sorry,
but I would call him differently.
Oh, yeah? And how, for example?
How shall I know? I make up 
a nickname.
Uhm, laddie, for example, exactly, laddie!
"Dinner is ready, laddie!"
Stripling.
Eventually you have to
explain to the lad,
that there was another lad,
who has attacked the Poles.
Claude, that's not funny, right?
Well, a little bit.
Babou, you're going to call my son
by his name.
Which is after the largest
romantic hero
of French literature
of the 19th Century.
And after the greatest tyrant
of all time.
Adolphe was named Adolphe long before Adolf.
Yes, but your Adolphe
comes after the other.
There, look, he lifts his arm already!
He makes the Nazi salute!
You do not believe that, that Adolf
became Adolf, just because his name was Adolf?
Could you repeat that?
You do not believe it,
Adolf became Adolf ...
Can we eat now
and talk about something else?
- No, Babou, this is important.
- Adolf Hitler
did not become Adolf Hitler,
because his name was Adolf.
Had his name been Michel or Pepito,
he would have been just as bad.
One would have said, "Hail Pepito"
and I would have my peace now.
Without a doubt, but apparently
his dad and his mom
had a similar taste as you, huh?
Because they called him Adolf
and not Pepito!
But Adolphe is not responsible
for the actions of Adolf!
When you speak of deeds
you talk about the murder
of millions of people!
He has not stolen a bike,
fucking shit!
But my Adolphe neither!
In what language does it get in there?
- Give it a try in German!
- Stop yelling!
Your wake up the children!
Really, it's enough.
I put the olives into the tagine now.
And when I get back,
it's about something else.
No one has touched the starters.
Vincent.
For the people
Adolphe no longer exists.
For the people
only Adolf Hitler exists.
Adolf killed Adolphe. Hm.
So what matters is what people think?
Absolutely, yes.
- Even if they're wrong?
- This is a categorical imperative,
a principle that is irrefutable,
because it is morally right.
"The maxim of your will
become general laws
- "through your actions."
- And if I do not agree?
You've read Benjamin Constant,
then please read Kant.
"Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals".
Very captivating.
So, I according to Kant I have the right
for Starsky and Hutch,
- But not on Adolphe!
- Starsky and Hutch
have not wiped out 
half of Europe!
Pierre! Mind the children!
This name is the epitome of
Crimes against humanity.
You can not call your son like that!
You don't have the right to!
So there are valid names
and prohibited?
- But of course!
- Okay, let's write a list.
Let us write a list.
Can I, uh, write in there?
Onto Melodie's notebook?
Just so I don't do something wrong 
at the 2nd Start again.
Well, I'm ready.
What is? Only Adolf?
Still?
No, we are looking for a new name.
Can you think of one?
Ah! Uhm ...
Why not Joseph?
It's classic and beautiful!
I'm sorry. Joseph is not possible.
- How so?
- Joseph Stalin.
Although it was also the father of Jesus,
more precisely, the stepfather of Jesus,
an honest and hard-working carpenter,
But Stalin came next.
Too bad for him. The rule of Pierre.
So, goodbye, Joseph.
Farewell, Benito,
Franco,
Augusto ...
Farewell, Pol.
- Paul?
- Pol Pot.
3 million dead. I know it was
the Khmer one, but still.
Doesn't spell the same
But doesn't make a different, it seems.
Babou does, sorry,
you need to rename your cat.
- His name is Polo.
- Polo, pole, no quibbles.
May I take "Adolfo"? No.
So, away with Polo.
And more! There's the Nazi Petain,
which makes Philippe impossible.
Saddam ...
You're not a big help,
you were sure all rivets in Abi.
- Vincent, now stop it ...
- How many victims must there be?
We have finally also have serial killers.
Jack the Ripper.
Charles Manson, contemporary,
but enormously energetic.
- We know what you're after.
- Oh, yeah?
Not to mention Carlos,
in the category of terrorists.
And Bin Laden.
Bin Laden sounds like Ben
and as Ben like Benjamin.
Let's say, for babous cat and 
my son the selection is narrowing down.
I have Bernard and Raoul.
Babou, you're lucky.
The cat was there before.
You know, Vincent, he's still
your son. So do what you want.
- No, he does not do what he wants.
- I will.
- No, he does not do what he wants!
- I will!
He is the father,
He does what he wants.
But ...
If you insist,
that your son is named like Hitler,
then go
and let the Rozenthals know.
What would I do with the Rozenthals?
Have they been visiting me prior to 
the birth of their children?
- This has nothing to do with it.
- Oh, yes! It does!
The Rozenthals are educated people.
They can distinguish very well
between Adolf and ... Adolphe.
Stop it! That's it!
Don't play the idiot here!
Wanting to call his son Adolf,
is at best recklessness,
at worst
a vile provocation.
I will gladly accept,
that you mean it well.
But after our conversation
you can no longer pretend
as if you knew nothing about it!
That's over.
It's over, to act like the one
who injures by rashness.
From this moment, you know,
what you do.
Now it is a conscious act.
You can not walk in an SS uniform
and say:
"I just like to dress up." No!
So if you
insist on the name Adolf,
then I'll take that
as a fascist act.
As a creed.
That's it.
Thread done.
Ok, you're certainly right.
I can name my son
Adolphe.
(Elizabeth and Claude laugh relieved)
You see, he is not narrow-minded.
You always say he is narrow-minded.
I'm proud of you.
So, do you want the Tajine now
or everything together?
- Mm, rather all together.
- All right.
And when I get back,
we explain Claude,
why he is not allowed to go to Marseille.
Oh ...
(Pierre laughs)
- And what district you have in mind?
- Uh ...
You shall wait for me!
Man, wait!
(Suppressed laughter sound)
Oh!
(Soft music starts)
You were right, Pierre.
One can not ignore the others.
Do you know what convinced me?
That argument about dressing up.
A private act that, if one wants
or not, is a public deed.
Whatever you do, is it politically.
Everything is on display.
Neutrality does not exist.
Yes, I think so.
So you're right.
The more I think about it,
the more certain I am.
I call my son
- Adolf with "f".
- What?
You have enlightened me.
The cover!
That was the trigger.
Chaplin!
Suddenly I remembered Chaplin
with his beard.
Who was the greatest anti-fascist
artists, if not Chaplin?
He understood everything.
He even made a parody of Hitler's
appearance.
Now I'm sure.
Thanks to your words I call
my son Adolf with an "f".
- What are you talking about?
- I do not give in out of cowardice.
Or something like adaptation.
I will make a statement.
I put myself on the street,
in front of the tanks,
like this Chinese student
on the Tiananmen Square.
And I say to Hitler: "You have us
taken Alsace and Lorraine from us."
"You won't take our firstnames 
in addition!"
You and your simplistic way of thinking,
you make him almost a myth.
Have him almost exalted to God,
an unattainable icon.
- I raise Hitler to God?
- That's it.
If Picasso would have named his son Adolf,
he would have made a greater contribution
to Peace
than with his Guernica.
That is intellectual nonsense.
You've convinced me.
Now we are at eye level.
So, imagine a girl,
very ugly, terrible clothes.
One of the variety
"Careworn links activist".
A bit like that one,
you choose in your thingy.
And now imagine
This girl's name is Marilyn.
Ah!
The memory of this actress
we all admire, would be spotted.
Can you explain to me why this
should not work the other way around?
My son will be a wonderful guy.
He will defeat fascism.
He snatches Hitler's monopoly
and plunges him from the throne,
- onto which you've put him.
- Honestly ... I have no words.
- This is absolute nonsense.
- Oh ...
Claude, which man
do you despise the most?
Uh, Hitler, I would say.
- No, someone today.
- I really don't despise anyone.
Damn, now make some effort!
There probably is a person
that displeases you somehow!
- Well, you do not know him.
- Who?
The new CEO
of Radio France.
An upstart and Schleimer,
as in a textbook.
You see, if you want to, you can
even hate a little bit. Keep it up,
then you are normal in 10 years.
And what's his name?
- Francois Chocard.
- Ah!
Francois Chocard.
That sounds like a real idiot.
- Yes.
- But if you hear it,
you do not you necessarily think of 
Francois Truffaut,
not Francois Mitterand,
not Francois Mauriac.
Not Francois Villon,
I not Francois I.
- No don't you start as well, Claude!
- Not Claude Francois.
So if one succeeds to have 
Francois Chocard disappear,
just because he is stupid, 
even in the circles of Radio France,
President
and our greatest writers,
then believe me, Adolf Larchet
will sweep Hitler from the throne.
Adolphe is dead! Long live Adolf!
(Laughs softly)
- (Elizabeth) What is the matter?
- I think
Adolf has just
won another battle.
- Again.
- And that thanks to Francois Chocard.
- What is he talking about?
- Oh, Babou, then stick around!
Well, sorry,
I'm standing in the kitchen!
Yes, I know, but every 2 minutes
you're jumping up again.
I'll do the shopping,
I take care of the children,
the food, all the laundry, everthing!
And just as I start asking something
you tell me to shut up!
- I did not mean it.
- But that's how I heard it!
No, wait, stay with us! It makes
much more fun when you're here!
And me, if the food not when
it gets onto the table.
But, Babou! My Babou!
- Oh no, stop it.
- Babounette!
Stop it!
A kind of little erotic game.
Surely she spanks him
now and then the back.
You give no rest, huh?
No. I know Babou.
These seizures she has, since she is 8 and a half.
Forgive me, Babou.
It's just that your brother ...
Stop it! Go away, you annoy me!
Get out!
- My ... my ...
- No, stop it, get out!
"DoÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â„¢a of smile, smile and say:
- "Uh, my crazy ..."
- No, Pierre. No poetry.
- Save that for yourself.
- Oh, come on.
(Turns down the music)
(Music continues softly in the background)
(Laughs)
- So, I've really swallowed that one.
- What?
- The Adolf.
- I hope so. I'm serious.
I just discovered the book.
Under the Buddha.
You have hidden that poorly.
(Laughs softly)
(Both laugh suppressed)
As he puffs up himself,
our professor.
Crazy!
"The issue is settled!"
Hey, you've at least least read it?
Not a word.
Only the blurb.
You won't tell them?
I'll for sure don't participate in 
your childish dick waving.
- Why, you're afraid you'll lose?
- I do not say anything.
But I will not lie either.
So take care for yourself how you get along,
But let me rather ...
It's so scary,
what a Swiss you are.
Even Adolf has respected
Swiss neutrality.
- That point goes to you.
- Thank you.
Shh! Uh!
"Theme done."
- And? Now you can tell.
- What?
Well. The name that you have chosen.
Henri.
- Like your father.
- Yes.
- Ah, Francoise will be pleased.
- I hope so.
Uh, maybe you should help Babou.
She's slaving in the kitchen.
- Like a lunatic.
- (Babou laughs)
- There they are the lovebirds.
- Ah!
Is Anna here already?
Yes, she didn't want to wake 
up the children
and climbed up the facade.
Not so easy in the 5th month.
Well, what the heck.
She will catch up with us anyhow.
(Pierre) Well, come on! To the table!
(Unintelligible conversation)
(Music comes to the foreground)
(Unintelligible animated conversation)
And ... and Apollon asks:
"Why are Papas breasts so hairy?"
- (Laughter)
- Good one.
- Do you want another punch?
- But not in the balls, that hurts.
- (Laughter)
- Very funny. Have been waiting for it.
It does certainly good to laugh again.
Hey, that wasn't worth it,
arguing.
- Completely of your opinion.
- When is it worth arguing?
- Oh, Pierre, please don't.
- Babou, let him answer at least.
What is personally important enough
to you so it is worth arguing about?
Well, I do not think that it must be,
- that at every small meal one argues.
- No, that's true.
But you have not answered 
my question.
So, tell me.
What shall we talk about?
It's boring,
to always be just an onlooker, right?
Well, come on! Start on a theme
and we climb aboard.
- (Claude and Elizabeth laugh)
- What's so funny?
Say what you like? The topic
Fascism seems to bore you.
That doesn't bore me,
but that's not what you talked about.
- Oh, no?
- And what was it?
I just want to say
this was not a serious conversation.
I mean, you amused yourselves, you're doing as if.
You play a role,
like little children.
We play a role?
- Yes, like in the past, cops and robbers.
- (Apollon) Maman! Read something to me!
You are playing with social issues
like with toy cars.
What do we play with tonight?
Headscarf in Islam,
the rental bike, the right to strike?
- (Apollon cries continuously)
- It's always the same.
You lead this war of words
for the umpteenth time
You don't believe in it yourselves.
For me it's quite entertaining, but
don't make me your referee.
He thinks we're entertaining.
Offensive, but sympathetic.
No, you do not understand.
Monsieur is on top of things.
That I stand above your conversation,
does not mean,
I'm standing on top of things.
(Admiring whistle)
Switzerland has awakened!
Would you want to get down your horse
and talk to us?
- With us, your old friends?
- Aristotle, come out of your cave!
No, that was Plato
with the allegory of the cave.
Yes. (Laughs softly)
Aristotle was also in one,
only, he never came out of it.
You're lucky,
it's the same era.
But aren't all the philosophers
from the same era?
That was our theme in the philosophy exam.
- So I had a '5
- Ha!
Hey, by the way. Guess
whom I met yesterday.
At 6pm in the Cafe Beaubourg
I drunk a Kir with someone. 
Guess with whom?
- This swill you drink?
- At CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Beaubourg especially.
Come on, guess, with whom?
Someone you have not seen for a long time?
Eternities.
And what gets the winner,
apart from your eternal gratitude?
Well, what do I know?
A bottle of champagne.
- Dom Perignon?
- Agreed.
- Antoine Flemmadon.
- Oh, that's impossible.
- How do you figure?
- No idea.
You look kinda like this,
like Kir with Antoine Flemmadon.
This is crazy,
noone can have guessed this.
- I gave him our number.
- What?
At least he was with you
thickest friends, right?
What's that?
- Ah?
- Pierre, please say something.
- Yes, that's right.
- Well, thank you.
(Cell phone rings)
- My dear, we are dying of hunger.
- You have not been waiting  ?
But of course we waited.
That's clear.
What are you saying? Come on!
- Well, what are the codes?
- You'll get a hint.
The first is "Marignan".
Yes, 1515. And?
- And "Austerlitz".
- Ok, see you.
She knows the date of Austerlitz.
Sometimes I wonder,
what she sees in me.
You're not the only one.
Say,
how did you find Flemmadon?
He found me. Via Facebook.
I felt sorry.
Does he still have his blonde streak?
At any rate
is he still so hairy.
You've seen him naked?
- (Claude laughs) Uh ...
- Well, that was missing!
- And, you enjoying yourself, yes?
- Uh-huh.
Just to let you know,
Apollon is asleep again.
But, Babou, your child psychiatrist says,
we should let him scream.
Our child psychiatrist. And he says,
the father should get more involved.
Yes, all right. We need
not talk about it now.
And I need not be the one
that always runs.
I'll go, next time
- And how is he like, the psychiatrist?
- Expensive and stupid.
- Rather expensive or rather stupid?
- Well, that's the question.
(The doorbell rings)
What's it? It's on her way.
(Vincent laughs, it rings again)
- Ah, is everything fine?
- Hello.
Uh-huh. Excuse me, 
I'm so late.
Oh, don't worry, it doesn't matter.
Oh! Hach, those are beautiful.
It's cumbersome, getting up here to the 5th, huh?
Oh, you know, I sit all day.
But wait!
Suits you well, the new color.
That's sweet.
Pierre can not stand it.
(Pierre) That's not true!
Oh ... Ah, I see.
You've been waiting for me!
What else did you expect?
We are well educated, we Larchets.
- Look how beautiful.
- Yes.
- That was not necessary.
- You do not want them? Then give them back.
Oh. My husband...
Today he is indeed irresistible.
- Hello, Anna.
- Hello.
- All fine?
- Yes.
You've gained not a single ounce.
What a figure!
That you've never told me
when I was pregnant.
- Yes, of course, darling.
- Well, you've also gained 25 kg.
Oh ... These were never 25 kg.
What the heck. But it's almost
gone again.
That was 5 years ago!
- Uh, but it fitted you really well.
- These were never 25 kg!
That looks delicious.
There are enough pies left.
- I have put something aside for oyu.
- Sit down.
He is already 5, Apollon?
- So, how are you, how are things?
- Very well, very well.
We prepare the shows,
there's it's topsy-turvy.
- How long does it take?
- Till the end of March.
And in June
starts the winter collection
but by then they'll have to do without me.
Why do you do winter fashion in summer
and summer fashion in winter?
- I never understood.
- We are preparing for the next season.
- Hm
- Not everyone wears corduroy in August.
(Laughter)
That's probably true, but who buys
a bathing-slip in March already?
Oh, no. No, no, no.
The question is rather, who uses  the term 
"bathing slip" these days?
What do you mean?
Swimwear. Just swimwear.
Yes, even though swimwear
need not be a swim slip.
Yes, but Claude
has always been the type "slip".
- Very "slip". Very, very "slip".
- Very slip.
- Very, very slip.
- Very slip.
- He's Mr. Slip.
- (Laughter)
Yes, true enough,
I may be the type slip, but ...
There's no But,
you're invariably slip.
- I've never seen you in shorts.
- Me neither.
Sweetheart, have you ever seen Claude
any different than in a slip?
How nice,
the call level has risen.
In the orchestra suit I
had no other choice than a slip.
There we have it.
It is his little trumpet's fault.
(Laughter)
- Here.
- But Babou, who will eat all that?
You need strength, eat!
You now need to eat for 2.
Ah yes, of course, for two.
1 plus 1 makes 2, huh?
And what kind of 2!
- Or?
- Oh, Pierre.
I beg you, do not start again.
What's going on?
Our friends were not particularly
fond of the name of our son.
- You told them?
- Yes.
He was unstoppable,
the proud papa.
And? You don't like it?
No, Anna, he do not like it.
It has surprised us more
than it displeased us.
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
It was the surprise.
No, not for me.
I'm sorry, Anna, but to me it has
more displeased me than surprised me. Yes.
But, no, I'm sorry.
We thought
the allusion ... pleases you.
(Silence)
The allusion?
But it is the allusion,
that we do not like.
Anna! Exactly the allusion is the issue!
I do not think
you both mean the same thing.
I believe,
Anna understands very well what I mean.
I think so. What I understand less,
is your reaction.
Ah, I'm surprised too.
That Vincent has such an idea,
I can perhaps understand if necessary,
but you? I'm puzzled.
Oh? I even suggested the name.
- That's right.
- Do you even understand
of whom we speak?
What he has done?
What has he done?
What ... I do not know
I never met him.
"I've never met him!"
She hears what she babbles there?
- Please, Pierre!
- She? She sits directly in front of you!
If you have to tell me something,
then tell me!
You're stupid,
you silly nut!
- Excuse me?
- Enough is enough! This will end badly!
- Listen, Pierre ...
- Are you happy now?
Blame youself,
if you choose such a first name!
What do you bother?
And what tone do you allow yourself?
He did not want to.
Oh, no? He is a professor,
he knows exactly what he's saying!
Yes, I know the importance
of words and their effect.
- Fuck you!
- Oh, no.
No! I call my son,
as I want!
- I'm sorry, no!
- I don't care about what one says,
who calls his children
Apollon and Melodie!
- Huh?
- (Vincent) Stop!
Stop! Stop.
It was a joke.
(Laughs softly)
Honey, I've told them,
that the name we
have chosen for our son,
is Adolf. (Laughs softly) Idiotic.
Funny but stupid.
(Snorts rid)
But quite funny.
(Vincent laughs whinnying)
It was fun, huh?
All right. So that's why
Pierre was so enraged.
In truth
we call our son Henri.
Just like Dad and Grandpa.
And when Anna spoke of "allusion"
it has meant Dad.
Ok? Now we all calm down,
sit back
and get at the falafel,
with Tchoutchouka, with Pita
and love each other again.
- Uh, darling, please eat.
- Shut up.
Well, OK, that was stupid.
Totally stupid.
I admit it.
I'm an idiot. I'm sorry.
Anna, please apologize.
Pierre, please apologize.
I apologize in due form. Yes?
Hm
(Silence)
I think
I messed up the mood.
Do you want play
something for us with your ... Bp?
(Laughs)
Oh, gee, Babou, now help me. 
What do I have ...
Uhm ...
Does anyone want a mint?
Me.
Pierre?
You don't say anything.
You ignore it. As always.
What am I ignoring?
Don't you get that this joke
basically came down to,
show what ridiculous names
our children have?
Come on, stop it, Pierre,
that was a joke!
Nothing more! By accident
I got "Adolphe" into my hands!
You were also holding "The Karamazov Brothers"
in your hand,
but you chose neither Ivan nor Dmitri.
Admit that this wouldn't be so funny.
Yes, we laugh ourselves silly.
Pierre, he apologized.
Vincent did, but Anna not yet.
Oh, just continue to call me 
stupid nut, if you want to.
Oh, honey, I pray thee.
Pierre, no one has ever said that
the names of your children were ridiculous.
No, she said,
she would not allow to be dictated
by someone who calls his children
Apollon and Melodie.
She was annoyed, now leave it.
What's the meaning of such a sentence?
It means that you shall not
prescribe her,
that she is old enough,
to decide for herself.
Ah, so this part of the sentence
I have well understood,
just the end puzzled me.
- What do you want to hear, Pierre?
- Well, that's obvious.
He wants to know what I really
think about the names of his children.
Exactly.
She thinks they are very nice,
your first names.
- Really?
- Indeed.
We think that Apollon and Melodie,
that's sweet.
Hm, I was wondering,
whether you make it, and so it was.
- What do I do?
- Your grimace.
What grimace?
The one that you draw every time you say
"Just go on", "very interesting"
or "Yes, if you like it"
but in reality you mean the opposite.
- What a bullshit.
- You're drawing a grimace.
Stop it, Pierre, stop it, damn!
You're annoyed. I fooled you.
But can we stop now?
So, honestly.
How was it with the Japanese,
my darling?
I do not know, "my darling".
They were Koreans.
How about the Koreans,
my darling?
- How come? You're interested?
- But of course.
So, I don't know.
Normally you don't ask me.
I wanted to see how you react
when I do.
Of course I'm interested in
your work.
Look at this.
What's the name of
my business partner?
Well, that's ... Well, Gizmo, um ...
That he does not know ...
The guy that annoyed you recently, you know.
- Yes, indeed, I know. Yes.
- Me too.
- Me too.
- Even I know that.
Me too... What's his name? With
such a stupid name. I ... Oh ...
- It's on the tip of my tongue.
- Ah there! Now again!
- What?
- The Grimace!
You're a pain in the ass!
What do I do? Come on, show me!
I do not know. Kinda like, uh ...
"It's on tip of my tongue."
(Laughter)
- That's how I do? Really?
- Yes.
- Oh no, no.
- No, oh no.
- No, no, no.
- Well, then, there you go.
No, no, you don't do it like that.
But ... you're making a grimace.
What, now you start it as well?
As much as I regret, Vincent,
but you make a grimace.
Well, maybe more like little pout.
Yes, maybe more like little pout.
And how does it look like,
my little pout?
A bit like this...
(Pierre and Claude) Yes, exactly!
"Oh, look!
Very nice, your new haircut. "
Ah, well you look!
"Pierre, this is your Scenic's down there?
Hoho, a Scenic has real class. Hm? "
Oh yeah, yeah, that's it exactly.
"Great, great class."
(Laughter)
"Oh no, we think Apollon
and Melodie is really cute! Super cute! "
That's it! Exactly!
You're crazy! I do not do like that!
- I swear.
- I'm not a duck!
Oh no, a chicken butt!
(Laughs Claude squeaky)
Rather a chicken butt.
- I thus have a chicken butt mouth?
- A little bit, yes.
(Chuckles)
Is that so funny, right?
(Suppressed laughter)
Ok, if you enjoy it.
(Roar of laughter)
"If you enjoy it."
"If you enjoy it."
(More laughter)
Ok if my grimace means
you are a pain in the butt to me,
agreed, I'll put on a grimace.
Have you seen it?
Now calm down.
You asked.
Oh, come on, Babou, leave me alone.
- Did you ever feel like theater?
- Sure, I'll even do a little bit,
- With my 10-graders.
- They are lucky with you.
- You have a talent for observation!
- Stop it.
- This pout! As he lives and breathes.
- You're outrageous.
- So ...
- So, what else?
You can consider Apollon and Melodie
to be ridiculous.
Oh, you too. Leave me alone.
- I do not understand.
- Now don't be so!
You know pretty well that
these are not normal names.
"Apollon and Melodie" sounds
like a song by Charles Aznavour.
My daughter, your niece, your
sponsored child has an abnormal name.
What does that mean for you, "normal",
Vincent Larchet?
That is classic. Not original,
if you'd rather.
Then rather original than abnormal, yes.
Everything to weigh, Pierre Garaud.
That's him saying...
But seriously.
Would you say, "Adolphe",
is that normal or original?
I would say
a name that exists.
What do you mean: "exist"?
Apollon and Melodie exist too!
We in fact called them like that!
You slowly drive me crazy
with Apollo and Melodie!
No, his name is Apollon, not Apollo!
Well, there's probably no doubt.
Please?
Well, just like his father.
My son is ugly?
He is neither beautiful nor ugly.
He is 4!
He's ugly
and has a ridiculous name!
Oh! So, Pierre, you know what,
it's you I consider ridiculous, his father!
Yes, I think they are ridiculous,
these newfangled double names
as a symbol for some
Equality nonsense.
Yes, I think it's ridiculous, all the
first names that should be so special.
This "have to prove yourself" 
of originality.
These are not first names,
these are statements on your chest!
"Please do not forget,
I'm something special!
"Please do not believe that 
I am merely like all the others!"
"Here lives a family of
Left-wing intellectuals,"
"and yes, we have a TV Magazine"
"but a TV does not get
into our house! "
So. That I consider ridiculous.
Yes, true enough. "Henri Larchet" sounds
like 4-wheel-drive and the Figaro Magazine.
I do not care! I do not care,
how something sounds.
I do not care,
what anyone thinks about me!
You on the other hand,
you're obsessed with how you're perceived.
And even worse, you're obsessed
how your children are perceived.
You think you're original.
You're nothing but a snob!
I'm obsessed with my impression
and you don't care about yours?
That's the biggest joke
you've made today!
- That's right. We laugh ourselves silly.
- Here comes dessert!
- I hope you have left some space.
- Incredibly, these pastries.
- Really.
- Unbelievable, just unbelievable,
you'd say that! You!
You who embody the essence,
the concentrated pure form,
the substantial share of selfishness!
- What?
- Oh, Pierre!
- You call me selfish?
- No, you're not selfish,
- You're THE selfishness!
- Ah! Really funny.
I have probably a dozen
mistakes, but this ...
A dozen? That would be nice, Vincent.
Well, I think,
Vincent is pretty generous.
- Thank you.
- No, she does not understand,
that your selfishness is hidden, it
doesn't reveal itself immediately to just anybody.
Ha, thanks.
All I want to say,
you do not think at first glance:
"What an egotist, this Vincent!"
Because his method is more subtle.
There's something that you do not immediately
notice. And yet, there it is.
- Do you understand?
- No.
You swing yourself up into rhetorical heights,
which are inaccessible to me, Pierre.
Of course you understand.
You understand perfectly even.
You're far more intelligent,
as you cast out.
Thank you. If so, then explain to me,
how I'm selfish?
- No, in what respect am I THE selfishness?
- Vincent!
I am interested.
It interests all of us.
(Both) No.
You are a human, who above all the dimensions 
is self-referential.
You start every sentence with "I".
You do not endure,
if you're not at the center.
And for that you do everything, absolutely everything!
I think of all the people
whom I have encountered so far,
are you the one to which this word
best fits: selfishness.
And you think, I was always like this?
Perhaps not always,
But for a while.
- When?
- What, When?
When was it that 
you noticed it?
Stop it, please!
This is awful!
- So, when?
- Claude, now say something!
So, when?
Ts! Thank you, Claude.
It started with Moka.
- Moka?
- Moka, the dog. The dog of Bibiche.
- Who?
- Bibiche.
Beatrice, the sister of Papa.
Well, the tall blonde,
with the cards.
She married the banker from Limoges,
this oddball, with the ...
Well, ok, the dog of Bibiche.
And then?
Do not look like that.
You know very well what I am talking about.
- No.
- Bibiche had a puppy.
A horrible poodle.
She treated him like a child.
Terrible! She always gave him kisses.
It was a nightmare.
She made him even perfumed.
She sprayed him with Shalimar!
It was a very hot day.
In summer.
The big ones took a nap.
We were bored to death, Vincent and me.
How old were you then?
Maybe 11, 12 ..
- We were 13.
- Ah! Suddenly you remember it.
Bibiche had told us that
Moka was afraid of water.
He was a pussy, like a cat.
(Laughs loudly) What a spoiled
Toad! Do you remember, Claude?
Oh yes!
Of course!
That was the dumbest dog in the world.
There was a pond.
We threw rocks at the water lilies
as Moka showed up and started
to relapse bern on my leg.
Pierre doesn't like dogs.
Then I had an idea.
I said to Vincent:
"What if he gets a kick?"
Just so, as a joke.
What one does at age 13.
Vincent was not amused.
He thought it was a stupid idea.
Wasn't it a stupid idea?
Oh yes, very stupid even.
He's not at all with dogs.
I didn't think twice. I gave the dog
a kick and it flew into the pond.
- What?
- He sank like lead into the deep.
- A short bubble and he was gone.
- No.
Hm
Hm
It's you .. who killed Moka?
Yes, it was me who killed him!
That is horrible.
No, this is not the horror.
That was just a stupid thing.
The horror is that Vincent stood up
and told everyone, it was him.
I'm sorry,
I've saved your ass.
You see how he is?
At 13, he was already like that!
He lured me into a trap.
Initially, I thought, he does it
out of friendship, but no!
- Do you know what he did?
- Uh, no.
He stole my status as a murderer.
- Huh?
- Not even that he could leave to me.
He has swept me, denied me.
And you know, why all of this?
Uh, no.
To set the scene,
to maintain its image.
I drowned the poor mutt,
But he goes to Bibiche
and says to her
with utter Conviction:
"Bibiche, I killed Moka."
Babou, get the camera,
we have to film this.
And once again you were Don Quixote
and I was Sancho Panza.
Tell me, Sancho, you still do remember
though the beatings,
- which I got for it?
- I remember exactly.
All remember exactly.
That was your intention.
Exactly the same as with Adolf.
Just so that all remember.
Just to get noticed.
A summit of selfishness.
All this because I did not want 
to share my spanking with you?
"Egocentric,
selfish, narcissistic,
"Is concerned only about his advantage"
"does not recognize any truth
other than his own existence. "
You are the definition
of the word "selfish", Vincent.
Hold it! If you are at it,
look for "S".
"S".
- "S" as "stingy".
- What?
You found my adjective,
now we are looking for yours.
Stingy.
- That's all you can come up with?
- I would not say,
that I can't come up with more,
but it occured to me really ...
- Quite spontaneously.
- So, we're done with that now.
One set for each. Zero to zero.
Let's take a break
in this cockfight.
Very good idea.
- Zero to zero, there is no such thing in tennis.
- What?
You said "One set for each.
Zero to zero." Absolute nonsense.
- You can be a pain.
- Yes.
And very annoying when it comes to language.
Ah yes, I forgot your sense of words
and their effects.
- Well that's me.
- Listen, Pierre.
I just wanted to win some time.
But if you really want to go back
into the arena to your bull,
then grab your red cloth
and fight.
Arena ready! Go!
Well, come on, you miser!
Oh, please, stop it now!
Pierre is not at all miser.
No, he's stingy,
penurious, avaricious,
has a problem in dealing with money.
So, you are generous
and I'm stingy, yes?
How generous,
to give Melodie an iPod!
She just turned 4 years old!
Excuse
that I do not have your account balance!
Well, your wooden chopsticks
surely have not ruined you.
That was Mikado, you ass!
- With my money you'd be the same.
- Because I do not spoil my children?
Because you do not spend a cent
without him turning it around 10 times first.
You should see yourself
with your wallet,
your mini-wallet.
You cling on tight to it.
If you ever take out a coin, one could
think, you draw yourself a tooth!
You're a penny pincher!
The Penny Pincher
has entertained you with pleasure.
Your wife has entertained us.
But ... Pierre is not a penny pincher!
On the contrary. He's, uh ...
Uh ... uh ...
If, if, if he is any ...
If, if ... Wait!
If, if, if ...
Oah ... pfff ...
It doesn't occur to me, but he ... he ...
(Haws)
He is someone who ... who ...
Who what? Is generous?
Is Switzerland going to post
a contribution as well eventually?
- Well, I ...
- What? Do not merely say,
you as well. Do you also think,
I'm greedy? Ha.
Let's say you're someone who 
is prudent.
Exactly! That's it. He is thoughtful.
In the language of Claude that means,
you're a total penny pincher.
- I never said that!
- But you think so.
All right, Claude, all right.
It's nothing. I am pleased to see
that through me
you have found a common ground.
I think, now,
that you're so close,
so sincere,
are so open and honest,
you should know, Claude,
what nickname Vincent has given you.
Oh, no, Pierre, now's enough!
So really, one like the others. You
determine the talking for the whole evening.
- She's right.
- Did you ever ask yourself
- whether we are interested in your war of words?
- She's right.
Has anyone of you said
thanks to Babou for the dinner?
- Oh, yes.
- No.
- We have said thanks.
- Oh, yeah? When?
- You were in the kitchen.
- Ah yes, well, of course.
(Silence)
What is my nickname, Vincent?
- Claude, stop it.
- Now don't you get it started now!
Leave it.
I'd like to know my nickname.
No, you would not be happy to know it.
What's the big deal about it?
Exactly, what's the big deal?
- But it interests me now ...
- Why don't you simply trust us?
Better don't get into this.
Do not be so childish as they are.
- Good. Vincent, what is my nickname?
- Vincent, I forbid you to tell.
You forbid it? I must be dreaming.
- Claude, stop it!
- I want to know, damn it!
- The plum.
- Hach!
- Pierre!
- What?
Excellent. Bravo, Pierre.
He calls you "the plum".
Are you happy now?
Plum?
Like loser?
(Elizabeth) Uh, no.
No, Claude.
Like a greengage.
The Royal Plum? I do not understand ...
Do not play the fool.
You understand very well.
We love you as you are.
That is not bad.
What are you talking there?
Well, a greengage!
You really don't get it?
No, I do not understand.
Not really.
(Tortured breather)
- A queen.
- Hm.
- A Queen!
- Hm.
Well, a Cutie.
A doll, a fagot, if you want.
Do you now understand?
You think I am gay?
Is that it?
You know, Claude ...
It felt great
to admit the thing with Moka.
Uh, I'm sorry,
but I'm not gay.
Ah! Well, then you're the only one
who knows nothing about it.
(Pierre laughs sheepishly)
Haven't you heard
what I said?
- You can tell us!
- If he does not want to talk about it?
It is his life.
If it were me, I would tell it.
What's there to confess?
But I'm not.
I am not ...
Well, Claude!
You've always been a bachelor.
You're a musician.
You're living in the arts district.
You wear orange.
What man is wearing orange?
Except perhaps at Guantanamo.
You're baking cherry pudding.
You're sipping Kir.
You go to a manicure.
You hear Celine Dion.
Celine Dion, I beg you, Claude!
- And always these incense sticks.
- It is incense paper.
- It does not matter, but it is scented.
- Meaning?
That is to say, someone who does not eat meat,
is a vegetarian.
Anyone who flies an airplane, is a pilot.
No offense, a fact.
But that's frightening.
I have no words
with so much clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and stupidity.
I love guys, because I am
wearing orange shirts from time to time?
Do you understand what you are saying?
I like Visconti and even Cary Grant.
Funny that was not mentioned.
- We do not condemn.
- No!
Oh well.
Nice, so obviously ...
we have made a mistake.
- Sorry.
- Vincent, now leave it!
Excuse me, I did not know
that he likes women.
Or? You, uh, you like women?
In any case, one, yes.
What?
- Have you met someone?
- Yes.
And you are together? Really?
Yes, one can say so.
And how is she? Tell us!
Slim, chubby, blonde, brunette, big
breasts, shaved, tattooed? Tell us!
Stop it, Vincent! You're embarrassing!
He can tell it to us! Be no
frog, Claude! Spit it out!
- I do not want to talk to you about it.
- And why not?
I do not understand. First you complain
we'd play a role
and when it comes to the crunch,
you block it. You are hiding!
Oh, Claude, gay or not,
but one thing is certain:
- You're a coward.
- Well, what do you want to know, Vincent?
No, Claude,
don't give in to his game.
What game?
We all grew up together!
We know nothing about him. He tells
never anything. He could run the protocol.
Come on, what do you want to know?
You can ask me anything.
- So actually a woman?
- Yes.
- And since when are you together?
- For a few years.
What? You have a girlfriend
for years and never told me?
So what? How is she?
Wonderful.
Please don't, Claude. Say no more.
Not here and now!
Why is he supposed to not say anything, please?
For that very reason, Babou.
He is not accountable to us.
Uh wait, Anna. Do you know her?
Yes, Anna knows her. Yes.
And we know them well?
Yes.
But it is not Antoine Flemmadon
by coincidence?
(Vincent and Pierre laugh uproariously)
No, not Antoine Flemmadon.
Someone you know much better.
What is "better"?
Much better.
Probably better than anyone.
What does "better than anyone" mean?
Claude stop it, it's enough.
Tell them the truth.
There is no going back.
That can not be true.
(Shrill ecstatic cries)
Now the time has come. Tell them.
(Next screams)
That's not true.
That's not true.
Claude! Otherwise, I'll tell them.
Well, all right, I say it.
Stop, stop, stop!
Shut up!
What does he want to tell us?
I'm sorry, Vincent.
I did not want it to happen.
That's not true. This is not
possible! That you did not do.
- What have I not done?
- Well, you two there!
Tell me, are you crazy? Vincent!
- Well, it's not?
- N. ..
- N. ..
- Oh ... But of course not.
- Are you crazy? What do you think?
- Uhm ...
But ... for heaven's sake, Vincent!
Never!
Oh, man, I was fucking scared.
(Breathing heavily) You know, I ...
Fuck it, I believed it.
- Oh, man, me too.
- Absolutely not!
Do you want to kill me?
(Laughs)
You're crazy.
I would have never done that.
And who is it now?
(Heavy breather)
(Claude breathed shakily)
I'm ...
It is Francoise.
Francoise who?
Francoise ...
Your mother.
- Huh?
- Uh-huh.
Which mother?
It is Francoise, Vincent.
Who should be the one, Francoise Vincent?
Well, who? Francoise Maman!
What do you mean, "it's Maman"?
Well, yes, uh ... We are together.
- Huh?
- Vincent ...
Shh!
(Breathing audibly)
Oh, my goodness.
And I thought we were close to each other.
We are close, Babou.
I ... I thought you trust me.
- And then nothing.
- But I trust you.
Obviously less than Anna.
- This is something different.
- When did you get to know it?
Babou, that's your thing.
I will not interfere.
- How long have you known?
- Vincent ...
If you again say Vincent, I will 
stick your trump into your ass.
- You know since when?
- Vincent,
I understand that that you feel injured
and you feel betrayed,
- But no one wanted to hurt you ...
- Stop this social chatter!
- You know it for how long?
- That's one thing
between your mother
and your best friend.
It is hard to accept, but it
was not my job to tell it.
She is right. It was not
her job to tell it.
It was yours.
Uh, your mother was not ready for it yet.
She thought,
you would not understand.
What's that got to do with it?
If it were someone else, whoever, it wouldn't 
matter! That would be the same.
What are you talking about? He sleeps with Maman!
Stop it with your "Maman, Maman,
Maman! Grow up!
You are not 8 anymore!
Your mother loves another man,
so?
Dad should not have smoked 2 boxes
cigarettes a day!
Claude and I are friends for 30 years. 
Since then, not a day goes by
on which we do not speak,
see or write. Not a single one!
How often have we both
talked until dawn.
How could you do that.
How could you?
- (Babou sobs)
- Babou.
Try to understand.
That was not against you.
That was his secret, that's all.
He perhaps just needed
a little time.
For a secret it always takes 2
I only tell Claude,
that I would have loved to share it with him.
I never kept something hidden from him.
But nobody tells everything. Nobody.
Everyone has secrets.
Moments to be shared with noone.
A few doors
always remain closed.
He knew everything.
The beautiful moments, the heavy ones.
I told him of the births!
The problems of the children, the tears,
the ailments, anything. All!
Even about your problems
we have spoken.
What? Are you crazy? This is ...
What?
This is intimate? This is private?
This is personal?
What are friends for, if you cannot
talk about what really matters?
I wanted to tell you 1000 times already,
but I did not know how.
And why did you tell Anna then?
He said nothing to me. Neither he
nor anyone else. I knew it.
- Just like that.
- What, you knew?
Are you a medium, or what?
- No, but he said nothing to me.
- Good.
Anna caught us one day at the pool
in La Castide.
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
I was afraid to ruin everything,
that you do not understand,
this love between ...
Francoise and me.
- Francoise is ...
- Stop it!
She's my mother!
Maman, who raised you,
when you were little.
Who prepared Nutella sandwiches for you.
Who gave you "5 Friends" for your birthday.
Maman, the wife of Henri, my father.
Does that ring a bell?
- Stop it, Vincent, you torture yourself.
- I torture myself whenever I want to!
I can understand
that you do not understand it.
What do I not understand, what?
Dad loved you so much.
"Claude here, Claude there"
and he has always defended you,
always had compassion. It makes me
so sick! Shall I tell you something?
You make me sick.
Vincent, you either calm down 
or you leave.
I'm leaving.
No, you calm down and stay!
You wanted him to talk,
So liesten to him now, too!
Vincent. Vincent!
There is not a day
where I am not thinking about your father.
I keep this moment ...
I always see this picture,
when I saw your parents for the first time.
It was in the apartment in Rue Monge,
just before Christmas.
Your father was standing on the ladder
and hung up a string of lights,
onto a huge pine tree. I.e.
He tried it and it did not work.
Francoise laughed.
There was an incredible familiarity
between them.
Really magical.
That was something I had
never seen before.
The day they took me.
Well, that day you all welcomed me.
Babou was my best friend.
A sister, a kindred spirit.
And you, Vincent, you have protected me.
Well, you've always annoyed me,
always kept at a distance,
but you were like a brother.
Francoise got me into music.
All these years she has been with me.
Through her I become someone.
Only when Henri died,
everything changed.
It broke out of me.
I realized, that .. I was in love for a woman
that I wasn't allowed to love.
So I decided to
no longer see her. For your sake.
I had to forget her.
And since then I just wanted to get away.
I attended every concert tour.
Then I left.
To Canada.
I fled.
Francoise believed Henri's death
had alienated me from her.
That she wasn't important any more,
that I wanted nothing to do with her.
It was the exact opposite.
I tried to forget her,
drive her out of my mind.
But the more time passed by,
the more I stunted.
Until I eventually couldn't
play anymore and stopped.
I came back to Paris,
I freaked out, I ...
One evening,
it was during a concert,
in the middle of the orchestra pit,
my hands began to tremble
and I gave up.
(Moving Music)
I got into the car and drove, without even
a single stop, to La Castide.
I had to see her.
I had to speak to her.
I could not
keep it to myself.
(Next dramatic orchestral music
in the background)
At dawn I arrived.
The house was covered in fog.
You could see no 2 meters.
I heard a rattling.
The sound of a door.
And Francoise appeared.
She did not seem surprised.
No.
She signaled me to come closer,
as if she had been waiting for me.
As if she had always been
waiting for me.
We stood there,
I do not know, a minute maybe,
in the cold and looked at us.
I was empty, exhausted,
but ... I was fine.
I was where I belonged.
You understand that?
Do you understand what I felt?
Suddenly everything was clear.
It was so easy.
It was self-evident.
It began to rain. A few drops
fell on Francoise' face.
They were running down like tears.
Perhaps they were tears,
I do not know.
But it was nice.
And then ... Francoise took my hand
and she said:
- Come.
- "Come."
I want you.
"I want you."
Shut up!
- (Clink, children screaming)
- Claude!
- Holy shit!
- Vincent!
- Vincent, are you crazy?
- Claude!
- Come on, show me.
- Get up, let's see.
(Next screaming children)
Oh, dear! I think
over there you missing a piece of tooth.
Super. Thanks a lot.
(Apollo) Maman!
Well, perhaps the Tooth Fairy is 
coming tonight.
What is it, Mama?
- (Apollon is still crying)
- Nothing. Only ...
Uncle Claude
stumbled over the tablecloth.
- You make an animal noise.
- Then use earplugs!
And, you have calmed down?
Do you realize what you've done?
How you behave?
Do you think, I calm down,
just because you say it to me?
Oh, so now one is not even 
allowed so say something any more.
Hey, Anna, it's ok.
- No! Look what you've done!
Anna, it's nothing.
Claude, he hit you!
You may be fine, 
but not me.
I want him to apologize,
and believe me, he will!
- Oh yeah? Or else what?
- Or what?
You are requesting me out?
Beware, Vincent.
He must apologize!
He started it!
He started it?
I think I'm dreaming!
Are you listening to yourself? I can not believe it,
that this is you.
The man with whom I lived for the 
last 2 years. The man I love. Ha!
You do have understood
that I love you?
That's the only reason why I try since an hour ago
not to hate you,
- But I find it harder and harder!
- Oh, yeah? Would you prefer
I'd be childish, self-centered
or make grimaces?
- And from you I will have a baby!
- That's what you said.
- What?
- Who knows,
perhaps you've
more revelations in store?
I never lied, when it came to us.
How would I know that?
I only believe what I see.
If you keep this attitude, it will
be your son, whom you will not see!
- Yes, sure. What nonsense. (Laughs)
- One moment. That think that's funny?
So, what do you want?
That I apologize?
Yes.
Ok. I'm sorry,
that I broke the nose,
- Even though you've deserved it.
- I'm sorry, that it hurt you,
but I did not have to ask
you for permission.
Everyone got that.
We're both adults,
Francoise and me.
- Especially she.
- Vincent!
- You are 30 years apart!
- 26
I am beginning to understand that Francoise
didn't wanted to say anything.
What, you even talked
about it?
Of course. Even dozens of times.
I told her to trust you,
you would understand it.
But I was probably wrong.
Look at you!
(Door slamming)
If you could stop now
with the roar.
The kids are in bed,
and I want to go too.
(Phone rings)
(Phone rings constantly)
Hello?
Yes, yes, I'll give the phone to her.
Babou ... Your mother.
Hello, Maman.
Oh, you know, quite fabulous.
A wonderful evening, yes.
The food was very good. Uh-huh.
Yes, exactly according to your recipe, yes.
All liked it.
I have the plate in my hand,
not a crumb left.
The raisins. No, no, no.
Not swollen, not disintegrated.
Well, more of a little crushed,
now that they are on the carpet.
Oh, why? Well ...
It might go too far
to go into details, but in short,
after Vincent has announced us
he wants to name his son like Hitler,
the dictator, Maman,
he and Anna,
who was an hour late, have admitted,
that they think that the names 
of our children are ridiculous.
Now you will say, "So what?
Compared to the murder of Moka?"
But still ... Moka, Maman.
The dog of Bibiche.
Exactly.
Ah, not to forget,
your beloved son,
who can neither stand Uncle Hector
nor the Rozenthals,
plans his visit to La Castide
from the 36th to the 37th
But now that he's broken 
your lover's nose,
he might be considering.
Well, Claude, Maman.
Why? Do you have any others?
Wait, I'll give him to you.
It's Mama.
(Quietly) Yes?
OK.
Well, uh, ... Yes and no.
Probably not, I would say.
You know, I still call another time, because ..
Exactly.
Ah, well.
(Very softly) I love you too.
Francoise will come to Paris tomorrow.
Ah! For their grandchildren
she doesn't fly in as quickly.
Babou, you should call again
and apologize.
Apologize?
You think I should
apologize to her? You?
- Oh, come on, Babou.
- What about me?
Who, please,
apologizing to me? Huh?
Anyone who asks me for forgiveness?
You asking me to forgive?
But, I, I, uh ...
What's the puzzled face?
I'm crazy, do you want to say that?
Or do you just want to tell
the others,
you have no idea what I'm talking about?
Do you think you will get away 
with your dog's eyes?
That all say, "Oh, the poor guy,
"his hysterical old wife
makes him a scene again?" Haha, haha!
You'd have to see your face, Pierre.
That's how my students look when I
when caught them transcribing.
The grammar book is on their knees,
The math formula is clearly written
with a pen on their palm, 
but their eyes say "I have
no idea what you're talking about, Madame."
And what you want to hear from me?
You do not know what I'm talking about?
Nothing comes to your mind?
Well, I do not know.
You could for example admit that I
sacrificed my PhD,
for you to write yours.
As Monsieur was busy with Montaigne,
who has prepared your courses,
corrected your exams?
But of course, I had maternity leave.
I had plenty of time. Haha! Ha!
The children! Come on,
let's talk about the kids.
Who really wanted to have them, because,
what's more beautiful in the world?
You never take care of them.
Although, but, but, but. But.
I'm unfair. Yes, on Sunday evenings,
then sometimes you play
with them for a quarter of an hour,
stirs them up again,
by jumping around, blblblblblblb!
Right before it's "march to bed!".
And then you are leave them to me,
overwrought, wet with sweat,
backpacks must be packed, stories
read, stuffed animals be found,
Pipi, nightmares ... And you? You lock
yourself in your room, because ..
Well, let's be honest, the little
buggers are worth 5 minutes to you. Ha!
I would also like to have time to read.
From time to time. But no!
Not possible, Babou.
No time to Babounette.
And what is the gratitude?
Not to a single one of your colloquia
you have taken me.
Because, in truth, Pierre,
there you are ashamed of me.
For my little post, my
small school, my small suburb.
You cannot shine with this,
this tastelessly dressed wife,
with her fat ass of 25 kg,
still, 5 years after the birth!
Ha, who asks me already
pardon? Me?
Who apologizes to me?
Not you, Pierre. As you can see.
You, Claude, to you I do not say anything.
You know it all.
Even if in return it 
is not the case.
Well, and you, Anna, pfff ...
What shall I say?
Because ... We anyway never had
anything to say to each other, huh?
And you Vincent?
Are you telling me the words,
I'm waiting for?
You will admit that one 
always has let you get through with everything.
The favorite of Maman.
The little clown of Papa.
Could be a moron in school.
The one, who was, without asking,
allowed to leave the table,
which could be nasty, stay over
night at others, who was allowed everything!
Because he is so funny, Vincent!
And what a blow for women!
But how stressful, 
to be a small Playboy.
Oh, the cutie, he doesn't have 
to bother with cleaning up the table.
"Your sister is going to do this.
Do not worry, darling."
"That's not a problem.
She even likes playing the cricket,"
"your dimwitted sister. No worries,
Vincent, my little darling."
"Go ahead, do any nonsense that you
want. We forgive you in advance."
And, Vincent? Did it go off?
Yes? No?
No "Forgive me" in sight?
How nice.
Fantastic.
So we are all equal.
No mercy tonight.
Now I'll take my bitterness,
my sadness and my anger
and put me to bed with them.
I'll leave with the dishes this time.
Pierre, you can stay
on the sofa.
If the children cry, you're up.
I will now swallow a pack of pills
and will be sleeping the next 2 days.
You all go to hell. Good night.
(Door is thrown)
I, uh, I just wanted to
make a joke.
All right. I'll leave.
- You think you can do that?
- Oh yes, no problem.
I'll take you home, Claude.
I'll take your car, Vincent.
You call a cab.
What?
Is that a problem?
See you tomorrow. When you have calmed down.
Otherwise, forget it.
(Soft music begins)
(Door slams shut)
- That's not true.
- Vincent.
What? You heard it!
She wants the kid alone.
Fine with me. OK.
Then we finally get to laugh.
- The RosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©? Yes.
- Yes.
Can you explain to me one thing?
What do all the women like about
this guy?
I do not know.
- Musician?
- Trombonist!
Now let's face it,
how can you play trombone?
- Blow into such a metal noisemaker.
- (Pierre laughs)
Ah! A true sorrel.
- Mm!
- Scarf finish. Just like him.
- Oh ...
- So, come on! That's a snore nose!
Has he ever landed a gag?
- No.
- You see?
One often hears that of stepfathers.
(Snort release)
Man
Oh, man
The idea that Maman
does it with the plum ...
With a little luck
they won't get any children.
I think I take a look after Babou.
- Hey, you stay, huh?
- No, I'm going to the hotel.
No, nonsense!
Stay here and help me clean up.
You know how you to convince me, huh?
You'll see, it's a comfy sofa.
Do you sleep there often?
Yes, happens.
No!
What?
Oh, awesome. Thank you.
Will you give me now
your eternal gratitude?
No. I borrow it to you.
I am a miser. Remember?
- There's still some couscous.
- Haha. And who is to blame?
I'm sorry about the table.
Oh, you know, that's not bad.
That little bit of wood.
Yes, you can make Mikado out of it.
Well, then ...
Good night, Sancho.
Good night, idiot.
- Sancho?
- What?
Did you know
that Gary Grant was gay?
Yes. But his name is Cary. Cary Grant.
With a "C".
Like Caipirinha.
Good night, ignoramus.
Sancho?
Oh ... What's now?
I just wanted to say ...
You know ...
We all have our little problems.
"In this difficult night, the skull"
"heavy from a relentless mix
of Grand Cru and CuvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e, "
"the neck stiff from 
Pierre's unbearable sofa"
"when I was just trying"
"to read the first pages of the novel
by Benjamin Constant,"
"that was when I realized that our family
was at a point"
"where there was no turning back."
"But life took its course."
"And as Anna
4 months and 6 days later, "
"at an important board meeting, "
"in the presence of the already mentioned
Koreans burst the amniotic sac ... "
I'm sorry, I must go.
"... rushed Babou, Pierre
and Maman and Claude into the clinic,"
"to make acquaintance with our son. "
- (Strained lute)
- Press, press!
- (Shouts)
- Come, breathe, breathe!
- (Sister) umbilical cord is severed.
- So, come. Hurry.
Quick, quick, get everything ready.
- What's up?
- All good. All good.
Is there a problem?
- (Baby crying)
- (doctor) Clean pretty.
Good! All good,
everything is fine, everything is wonderful.
Nothing to worry. Congratulations.
Your little girl is beautiful.
All healthy, all there.
We make her a little pretty
and then bring her to you.
(Doctor laughs)
Damn it!
(Anna laughs out loud)
"After I had conveyed my heartfelt 
thanks to the doctors team ... "
You studied 12 years and you
do not recognize, whether boy or girl?"
After 12 years of study? Maybe the
redhead's gonna get some glasses!"
"... we gave in to the necessity,
to paint pink, which was previously blue,"
"as well as to complete exchange
the initial clothing."
"But then, over the moon to hold 
this little creature,"
"we had a sudden realization."
How will it be named,
the little miracle?
Oh, crap!
Oh, do not worry, take your time.
Then see you soon.
"We stood there without a name,"
"Both completely exhausted,
thrown off course, like never before."
"That's when Anna had an idea."
"A great idea. An idea
that could not have been any better."
"What can I say, the mother of my
child is just a magnificent woman. "
- And?
- And?
And?
The good news is,
the baby is fine.
But the bad news is
it's a girl.
- But what a girl!
- (All) Oh!
You're a moron!
You're really nuts!
A little girl! 
Is that cute!
- Dazzling, she is!
- How heavy is she?
- 3100.
- (Both) Oh!
Hey, how will yo call her?
Plum.
You are not serious.
No. You know what?
We call her Francoise.
(Elizabeth) No!
"Maman hugged me for long,
Babou had tears in her eyes,"
"Pierre let out a cry of joy."
- It was Anna's idea.
- "Claude took my hand and said ..."
(With falsetto)
That's a wonderful idea, Vincent.
"And in that moment I thought
I'd detected in the face of my old friend
"And future stepfather
a grimace."
"Let's say no grimace,
more ... a small pout. "
