Guards! Royal salute! Present arms!
Some people are born
more fortunate than others.
Such was the case with me.
But as a child,
I was convinced of quite the opposite.
What little girl does not dream
of growing up as a princess?
But some palaces
are not at all what you'd think.
Even a palace... can be a prison.
Mama never explained why she
would have someone taste my food.
Why I couldn't attend school with
other children or read popular books.
When my father died,
Mama and her adviser,
Sir John Conroy, created rules.
He said they were for my protection,
and he called it the Kensington System.
I could not sleep in a room
without Mama
or even walk downstairs
without holding the hand of an adult.
I learned the reason for all this
when I was 11.
My uncle William
was the King of England.
Yet he and his three brothers
could boast only one living child.
And that was me.
Sir John's dream
was that the King would die
and there would be a Regency,
where my mother would rule England
and he would rule my mother.
So I began to dream of the day
when my life would change...
...and I might be free.
And I prayed for the strength
to meet my destiny.
I will be good.
God save the Queen!
God save the Queen!
God save the Queen!
Sign it!
Are you sure
that we're doing the right thing?
We've waited long enough.
Now, for the last time,
you will sign this order.
I will not sign it.
I say you will!
- I say I will not.
- How dare you, you...!
Sir John.
We were just...
It's time for the Princess's medicine.
Shall I?
- I'll do it.
Well, if you're sure.
- Good night, mein liebling.
- Good night, Mama.
How are you?
I've received a letter from England.
My sister says Victoria won't sign
the order for her Regency.
And why would she sign it?
The Princess is nearly 18. Why
would she sign away her own powers?
Because she is an ignorant baby.
Because she needs guidance and time
to prepare for her role as Queen.
Until then, my sister
will take her place as Regent.
Sir John Conroy would be Regent.
Unfortunately, the Duchess
is controlled by her controller.
It may be in Your Majesty's interests
to abandon Conroy and your sister,
before it's too late,
and support the future Queen instead.
Of course, the Duchess won't like it.
Baron, I was born the younger son
of a penniless duke.
Now I'm King of the Belgians.
Such journeys are not managed
without hard decisions.
Besides,
who controls a young girl most?
Now go to Germany
and finish my nephew's training.
Albert!
I suppose you want
to walk with me this afternoon.
Really? Just the two of us alone?
What would Mama say?
Hold still
or I'll never get your nose right.
Oh, I give up!
I give up. You are impossible.
You are impossible. You are impossible.
Victoria, your mother's waiting.
Come on!
Dash!
Where is the Duchess?
- In the drawing room, Your Highness.
It will take them three days
to arrive by coach from Coburg. Dashy!
How did you come downstairs?
- I walked.
Not alone?
- No, not alone.
Lehzen was with me.
- She held your hand?
She did. Though why she still has to...
Because not everyone in England
wishes you well.
Put the book down, please.
Dashy!
England is the key to peace in Europe.
Your uncle's throne is six years old
and born of civil war.
He only took the crown of Belgium
because England pledged her support.
And if he's to survive, he must have
English force at his disposal.
Favourite novels?
- Sie hat nicht viele Romane gelesen.
- English. Always English.
She has not read many novels.
They were forbidden until last year.
- But she did like...?
- The Bride of Lammermoor.
By?
- Sir Walter Scott.
Other recreations?
- Drawing. The famous dolls, of course.
Piano. Music, generally. It's hard
to believe she knows so little Schubert.
Never mind Schubert.
She likes modern composers.
Is she permitted the theatre?
- Only the opera and ballet.
Which opera does she like best?
Norma?
I Puritani!
In order to maintain control
over Princess Victoria,
Sir John and the Duchess keep her
away from King William's court.
Thus when she does
make a public appearance,
her mere presence causes quite a stir.
You must win her favour
before anyone else has the chance.
You still don't look well.
Maybe we should go away for August.
No, Mama.
- What do you mean, no?
We missed the Queen's birthday.
We will not miss the King's.
We've accepted. We're going.
Really, Victoria, don't issue
orders to me. I'm not a servant.
Well, you've already disobeyed
about the extra rooms. That's enough.
Are we to live like rabbits,
crammed in a hutch?
We live in a palace, Mama.
We're a lot better off than most people.
The rooms which I took were empty.
Keeping us out of them
was... almost immoral.
That's what John says.
- I knew he'd have a part in it.
My dearest child,
he only wants what's best for you.
I wish you could believe that.
I've invited the Coburg brothers
to come and stay.
You ought to know them better.
- Why?
Because you should.
Uncle Leopold thinks it's a good idea.
You stick one more pin in me,
I swear I will call the guard.
Your first visit is the most important.
We can not have any mistakes.
And always remember,
you're first a Coburg.
The King of the Belgians is a Coburg.
The King of Portugal is a Coburg,
so is the Queen of England's mother.
And you are the next piece in the game!
Now go to England and make her smile.
Is this all the luggage?
What if she wants to dance?
- It's your first visit. She won't.
Your Serene Highnesses, welcome.
- Thank you.
I'm Sir John Conroy, controller of the
Duchess's household. This way, please.
The Duchess is in the drawing room.
Ah! May I present her Royal...
- Hello.
I'm Ernst, ma'am.
This is my brother, Albert.
We haven't interrupt your studies?
- No, not at all.
How was your journey?
- Long, but not too bad.
We had books to keep us busy.
As matter of fact, I passed the time
reading The Bride of Lammermoor.
By Sir Walter... Scott.
Yes.
Do you want to come and meet Mama?
Of the modern composers, I suppose
Vincenzo Bellini is my favourite.
What a coincidence! So is mine.
Which of his operas do you enjoy most?
- No, wait, let me guess. I Puritani?
- As a matter of fact, yes.
I used to like it too.
Now I prefer Norma.
Dashy! Go fetch it! Fetch it, Dash!
Aye, aye, aye, aye.
Have I offended you in some way?
- No.
And Schubert.
I like Schubert.
I think...
I think perhaps you don't... but I do.
I don't mind Schubert.
Good.
Do you ever feel like
a chess piece yourself?
In a game being played
against your will?
Do you?
- Constantly.
I see them leaning in
and moving me around the board.
The Duchess and Sir John?
Not just them. Uncle Leopold.
The King. I'm sure half the politicians
are ready to seize hold of my skirts
and drag me from square to square.
Then master the rules of the game
until you play it better than they can.
You don't recommend I find a husband
to play it for me?
I should find one to play it with you,
not for you.
Why don't we ring for some music?
And then we could dance.
I've recently discovered the waltz
and I am quite in love with it.
Waltzing is not really my forte.
- Oh, dear.
What a shame.
You know the King wants me to marry
my cousin George?
Hmm.
What's he like at chess?
Victoria.
It's alright, Lehzen,
Albert can take me up.
You'll have to hold my hand.
Mama insists. I hope you don't mind.
Not in the least.
What did you want to say?
Only that I understand more
than you think of what your life is.
Do you?
My childhood wasn't easy either.
I lost my mother when I was a boy.
I know. She died.
- No, er...
That is, she did die eventually, but...
she was sent away long before that.
There was some difficulty.
It was all hushed up
and... no one talks of it now.
But I know what it is to live
alone inside your head,
while never giving a clue
as to your real feelings.
Did Uncle Leopold
ask you to tell me that?
No. Er, he actually told me
never to mention it.
Well, how little he knows me.
Hmm.
May I write to you?
You'll miss the princes
when they're gone, ma'am.
Don't be impertinent.
Those boys pester you.
- Oh, please, Lehzen.
You don't think I've come this far
to walk into another jail, do you?
You must marry one day.
- Well, I don't see why.
And if I do, I shall please myself,
not Mama or Uncle Leopold or the King
or anyone else. Trust me.
Must I?
- Yes, you must.
Be on your guard.
We are going to Windsor
for my uncle's birthday party.
In the castle of the enemy.
- Your enemy, Sir John, not mine.
Agree to nothing.
- What should I say about the rooms?
You needed the space.
Appeal to the Queen. It's ridiculous.
I wish you were coming with us.
You're very intent, Baroness.
Are you making a study of me?
Someone should.
Present Prime Minister?
- Melbourne.
Lord Melbourne.
The Liberal leader who'll probably be
in power when the Princess succeeds.
He may be troublesome.
- Why?
He puts the interests of England
above those of Europe.
Which is bad?
- Which is not useful to us.
He wouldn't spill one drop of
English blood to save a foreign throne.
The Viscount Melbourne.
Why would he save a foreign throne
if it wasn't in England's interest?
That is just the kind of thinking
your Uncle Leopold is afraid of.
Which is why he's content to find his
niece is the future Queen of England.
The Duke of Wellington.
In the public mind, the leader of the
Conservative opposition is a pet hero,
Napoleon's conqueror,
the grand old Duke of Wellington.
But not in fact.
- No.
You look in very good health, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
I wish I was. Enjoy the meal.
- Thank you.
The next Tory Prime Minister
will be Sir Robert Peel.
...and Lady Peel.
Which side does Victoria favour?
She's a Liberal. Above all,
she favours Lord Melbourne.
And he'll take full advantage of it.
Her Royal Highness,
Princess Victoria of Kent.
Her Royal Highness,
the Duchess of Kent.
The Lady Flora Hastings.
Hello, Uncle.
- Look at that demure little head.
And all of us
wondering what's inside it.
We'll find out soon enough.
Lord Melbourne will make her fall
in love with him. It's his method.
Don't underestimate Victoria.
- Don't underestimate Melbourne.
My dearest niece.
Won't you greet your cousin George?
- Good evening, George.
How can my niece and nephew have
grown up so when I wasn't looking?
Whereas you are quite unchanged
and as handsome as ever.
If I put my head very close to yours
and speak softly,
they'll think we're hatching a plot.
- Yes.
If I look a little surprised...
Well, then they'll know it.
I wish we saw more of you. But then,
nor you nor I are to blame for that.
The plain fact is, madam,
you have stolen 17 rooms!
One cannot steal a room, sir.
The rooms are where you left them.
Now they are used,
before they were empty.
I see. So I have no say
in my own palaces?
Why not move in here
and bring your Irish tinker with you?
The Queen and I
will be happy enough in the lodge!
So would I be, sir, if I thought that
people there would be polite to me!
How dare you talk...!
- Enough!
You have exhausted the topic.
Conroy tried to force the Princess
Victoria's agreement to a Regency.
She wouldn't sign it, sick as she was.
That says something for her spirit.
Your next birthday
will be quite a landmark.
I hope we'll see more of you at Court.
- I hope so too, Lord Melbourne.
You know,
should you ever need an ally...
you have one in me.
The Prime Minister
has more important calls upon his time.
Not at all.
I knew the late Duke of Kent.
Naturally,
I take an interest in his daughter.
You knew my father?
- Yes.
I'm sorry.
Is it difficult to speak of him?
No. I love to hear from someone who
knew him. For I never did, you see.
Well... he was a great gentleman.
Of that you can be sure.
Indeed I am.
Excellent company like his brother, the
Regent, but not quite so extravagant.
And kind, like his brother, the King...
but perhaps not so talkative.
Well, you make him sound
as though he were the best of them.
Oh, I think so, ma'am.
Your leader is hard at work, Duchess.
You see him hover with his net
to catch the pretty butterfly.
And when your party is back in power,
Duke, will you not do the same?
Not nearly as well as Melbourne.
Unfortunately, I have no small talk.
Peel has no manners.
And I would have a hard time
praising her father.
The most brutal officer
I ever encountered.
I thank you
for your good wishes on my birthday.
It has been a long life...
and an interesting one.
But I shall be content
with only a short while more.
Just enough... to dispense
with any thought of a Regency...
...so that I may pass the Royal
Authority directly to that young lady.
And not... to the hands...
of a person now near me...
...who is surrounded by evil advisers
and who cannot act with propriety in
the station in which she's been placed!
I have been insulted!
Grossly and continually insulted!
She has kept her daughter,
my brother's child, from my Court!
But from now on,
I'd have her know that I am King!
And I will not be flouted
or disobeyed by her
or by that jackanapes
she keeps about her!
Are you alright?
Families, who'd be without them?
Are you listening?
What?
Well?
- Ma'am, you do have a letter,
but it's not from Germany,
it's from the King.
So it is. Thank you, Watson.
Don't you see what he wants?
- He increases my income
once I'm 18 and he asks to see me
at Court, what is wrong with that?
The King wants to separate you from
your mother. He wants to control you,
to take you from those whose sole aim
is trying to protect you!
No need to shout. The people
will find out our business soon enough
without hearing it from your lips.
Tell her. Make her understand.
What Sir John means is that you're
unprepared for the task ahead of you.
And if I am, whose fault is that?
You're too young! You've no experience!
You're like a china doll
walking over a precipice!
Well, then, I must smash!
For it's too late to mend my ways now!
So if you'll excuse me...
- But I will not excuse you!
Now this is what you will do!
First, you will refuse the money and
demand that it be given to your mother.
Next, you will appoint me
your private secretary from today.
Finally, you will agree
to be co-regent with the Duchess
until your 25th birthday.
Neither she nor I will accept less!
You may do
what you like with the money.
Now, get out of my way!
And if you think that I will ever forget
that you just stood by silent
and you watched him treat me thus,
you are dreaming!
Is there no limit
to this disobedience?
Mark my words!
The reign of King Conroy is coming!
My poor sister-in-law. What is the hold
that wicked man has over her?
What about her uncle in Brussels?
Could he not be of assistance?
King Leopold is as slippery
as a barrel full of eels.
If he did dislodge Conroy, it'd only be
to tighten his own grip on the girl.
Mightn't there be some benefit
if I pay Princess Victoria a visit
before Conroy
has a chance to usurp her?
Very well.
Lord, in your mercy, get me past May!
That way she'll be of age and we'll
have killed off the Regency at least.
I tell you, Lord Melbourne,
his behaviour to me
makes it impossible to keep him
in any post near my person.
Any post whatever.
You don't think it more dangerous
to cut him loose?
I know things that mean
I could never have confidence in him.
Now, I see I must endure Lady Flora.
Mama cannot appear at Court
without a lady-in-waiting,
but I draw the line at Conroy.
And once I'm Queen, I do not wish
to look upon his face again.
Well, we can't prevent the Duchess
from keeping him
in charge of her own affairs.
That will be her mistake, not mine.
My dear Victoria, when I think...
Dearest Victoria,
if ever you should need...
What? Like a vulture? To hover
at the edge until the King is dead?
And, ma'am, you needn't worry.
I'll be your private secretary.
For now, at least.
Thank you, Lord Melbourne.
That is a great comfort to me.
- Wenn er tot ist, dann gibt es mehr...
- Ernst! English, please!
When he is dead, there'll be more
than one vulture to contend with.
We should consider
the new appointments.
Your ladies-in-waiting and so forth.
Perhaps the Duchess of Sutherland
for Mistress of the Robes?
Oh, I don't really know her.
Ma'am, she's a dear friend of mine.
You'll enjoy her enormously.
I should be lost without your guidance.
I hope you know how grateful I am.
- I'll draw up a list.
What is it? Don't you like her?
Yes, I like her.
More than I dared hope.
But it's not up to me, is it.
What do you call a man
who waits for a rich woman to decide
whether or not she wants him?
Then, why not tell her how you feel?
My dear Victoria,
these days will be full of sadness
since I know the King is dear to you.
Will you allow me to offer my support,
albeit at a distance?
If I cannot be with you,
then I pray you will hear my voice
in the music that I send.
You know my love of Schubert.
This is his "Swan Song".
And I play it with you in my heart.
Is he ready?
- Well, he may be, but she isn't.
Let her enjoy succession
and the freedom it'll bring.
We must wait for disillusion,
and the loneliness that follows.
Victoria.
You must come now.
Long live the Queen.
I'm going back to bed.
I imagine Lord Melbourne
will be here quite early.
Make sure he has everything he needs
if I am not ready to receive him.
Of course, Your Royal...
Your Majesty.
Victoria, wait. I will hold your hand.
No. Thank you, Mama.
And, Lehzen, in the morning,
arrange for my bed to be moved
into a room of my own?
Surely there's no need...
- As soon as possible, Lehzen.
The Council is assembled,
Your Majesty.
Her Majesty the Queen!
It is with a sense
of reverence and honour
that I address you,
my Privy Councillors,
as your Sovereign and Queen.
I mourn sincerely the death
of my dear uncle, the King,
but I know I may count on you to serve
me as loyally as you served him.
I am young, but I am willing to learn.
And I mean to devote my life
to the service of my country
and my people.
I look for your help in this.
I know I shall not be disappointed.
Thank you.
She starts on your watch,
Lord Melbourne.
Guard her well
and keep her safe from harm.
As a matter of interest, will a time
come when I read them first?
You'll enjoy this.
She has a real flair for description.
Present arms!
Dearest Albert, on Tuesday,
I went to inspect Buckingham Palace.
It is only just finished and I shall be
the very first sovereign to live there.
As I stepped out of the carriage,
for the first time in my life,
I felt freedom.
Splendid, is it not?
- Yes!
You'll have to decide
on a husband soon.
What about Leopold's candidate?
I can't marry the man
they want me to marry.
Oh!
Every suitor
will come with strings attached.
Can't I be my own mistress for a while?
Haven't I earned it?
Dear Lord M, he's so very kind. I
couldn't have asked for a better tutor.
You may dream of independence,
but you won't get it.
From now on, everyone will push you
and pull you for their own advantage.
Melbourne more than the rest.
Just remember, you are the Queen,
he's a politician.
And politicians, whatever their creed,
always resent a monarchy.
They pass through. You stay.
So just keep "dear Lord M"
in his proper sphere.
He's already chosen the new household.
About my ladies-in-waiting...
Yes, I'll have a list brought
over later. They've all accepted.
Only my aunt advised me not to be,
well, too partisan in my choice.
With respect, Your Majesty,
I think I understand these things at
least as well as the Queen Dowager.
I know that, of course.
And we want our friends around us,
of course, surely,
as we begin our labours.
We don't want to find Sir John Conroy
sneaking his feet back under the table.
No. Not if we have to line up
every friend we both possess.
Well, quite, ma'am. It's very cold
in here. Why haven't they lit the fires?
It seems the fires are laid
by the Lord Steward's department,
but lit by the Lord Chamberlain's,
and no one knows which footmen
should do it. It's not very sensible.
Well, if that's the way things are done,
I shouldn't meddle.
We must improve where we can.
If I've discovered anything
from touring England,
it's the suffering that needs my help.
Never try to do good, Your Majesty.
It always leads to terrible scrapes.
Lord Melbourne, that is not
what is preached from the pulpit.
No. That's why I never go to church.
One always hears
the most extraordinary things.
I've made no promise to him.
But sometimes I feel
quite alone in the world.
Never while I'm here, Your Majesty.
Lord Melbourne is akin to a miracle.
He has proved to be most generous
and sensitive,
quite wondrous in a politician,
someone I trust and hold dear.
He is the best company imaginable.
Sometimes we laugh so much,
it's as if we were naughty children.
Oh, Albert, I so look forward to the day
when you can know and value him
as I do.
Yours affectionately, Victoria.
Plenty of praise for Lord Melbourne
and not much of anything else.
Everything comes to he who waits.
- And if nothing comes, what then?
You've played with me, Baron.
And now it is enough.
I'm going back to England.
There must be a reason
if you wish to visit Her Majesty.
Then find me a reason.
Ich will diesen...
So, are you going to propose?
What? What am I supposed to think?
You're going to enjoy the weather?
I'm going to spend some time with her,
that's all.
Besides, I am forbidden.
It has to come from her, apparently.
So I could not propose,
even if I wanted to.
And do you want to?
Walk on! Hup, hup!
Please hold still. I'm afraid
I always find noses a challenge.
Am I permitted to talk?
Yes, but you can't move.
There's nothing to rival
an English garden.
Of all my life in Kensington,
it's the only part I'll miss.
But the gardens at Buckingham Palace,
surely...
You're moving!
- Oh.
Now you're smiling.
Impossible!
You're worst than him!
I believe we have a duty
to those in need of our protection.
It is the business of every sovereign
to champion the dispossessed,
for no one else will.
Take housing. May I show you?
Industry is expanding so fast
that people are not considering
where the workers will live.
But I've been experimenting.
By building these in units of two,
you can build safe, clean homes for
two families for less than the cost...
I'm sorry. I don't mean to preach.
No, there's no need to apologise
for being passionate.
It seems I have a lot to learn.
With all my duties and...
And I do take them very seriously.
- I know you do.
But plenty of people
will expect me to fail.
And there are even more
trying to take advantage
of my youth and inexperience.
Then, they don't know you like I do.
May I keep this?
So, remember, the first thing
is to find an anchor point.
So, take your hand back
to beneath your chin.
Good. This is where
it will come every time.
Now, release the bow.
Your hand must cover the leather,
like this.
And make a firm claw.
One finger, two fingers.
Claw.
- Yes, and back to beneath the chin.
Bend this arm slightly.
Rotate to catch the arrow.
Good.
Very good. Now, try with an arrow.
Ah. He's still here?
- At my mother's insistence.
Certainly not mine.
Where am I to live?
Am I to be abandoned here?
Or am I to beg along the highways
for a crust?
Come now. You will move
into the palace with the Queen.
But she's arranged
a separate apartment for you.
It will allow you both more privacy.
I... I don't want privacy
from my own child!
To exclude us will launch
the new reign in a cloud of scandal.
I know your game, my lord.
You want to be her father, her mother,
and who knows what else.
If I'm not to be her private secretary,
then what?
I'm sorry. I can see
that I am not speaking clearly.
You have played the game and lost.
The Prime Minister is here,
Your Majesty.
Thank you, Duchess.
Have I thanked you properly
for accepting the post?
It will involve
a good deal of inconvenience.
To be Mistress of the Robes
is a great honour.
I'm only anxious to prove worthy of it.
My Lord Melbourne
thinks you'll be perfect.
How is Albert's visit going?
He writes Victoria is under
Melbourne's control. He's frustrated.
Then he must stay in England
until the Queen thinks more of him
than she does of Melbourne.
Queen Elizabeth never married.
It didn't spoil things for her.
Are you familiar with the Coronation
Chair and the ancient Stone of Scone?
Familiar, yes... but quite in awe.
I'm terribly afraid of disappointing
on a day I so want to do it perfectly.
Just be yourself. Your instincts
are always to your credit.
I'm sorry. They're preparing
the Abbey for the ceremony.
I'm told they asked permission
for a glimpse of Your Majesty.
Don't be sorry.
- God bless, Your Majesty.
I do want to help them,
whatever you say.
And not just the labouring poor,
but the hungry and the homeless.
There are people who are lost. Whose
business is it to see to their welfare?
Well, in my experience, it's best
to let these things develop naturally.
If you interfere,
you risk overturning the cart.
Prince Albert doesn't agree. He's made
a study of the working man's condition.
He's full to the brim
with ideas for their improvement.
Is he indeed? How inspiring.
Well, good. He sounds like a young man
ready to take charge
at the first opportunity.
Then, you had better master
the rules of the game
until you play it better than they can.
Are you quite sure about that, ma'am?
Make your move.
Well?
You may not accompany me
to the Proclamation Ceremony.
You may not attend the Coronation.
Perfect.
- You're unprepared.
- No experience! Too young!
Then, they don't know you like I do.
Don't look so surprised.
The Queen has many different duties.
It's heartening to see she won't
neglect them, even on Coronation Day.
I don't think Dash would allow it.
- Try to get some rest before the ball.
I will. Since I firmly intend
to dance until dawn.
Her Majesty the Queen.
