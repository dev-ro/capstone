Start the car. I'm going to the
airport I don't want to hear a thing
what has happened?
- You said you will not be in office
You could've told me if you didn't
want to see me. Why did you lie?
Who lied to you? I'm
telling you the truth
I just came ten minutes back,
I swear. - You are lying
You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Hush! Why should I be ashamed?
Those semi-nude girls! How
could you touch them all over?
That's my business.
- Business?
I mean, I have to show
them what pose to take
You are an educated girl,
you should understand that
I don't know about that. I
can't see you with other girls
All right, listen to me.
You are my fiancée, trust me
I'll never lie to you,
trust me. Now...
go home, I'll come over and
explain. Okay? I love you. Bye

I can't see a thing.

And this?

I'm willing to pay any price, sir
I don't have photos right now...
...but I got some
negatives that you can take
Fine?
- Yes, sir
Your father fixed your wedding,
with the consent of the two of you
But ever since you were engaged,
I've only seen you brawling
Your fathers were childhood
Friends, they were thick friends
They came here and together
they joined the Indian Embassy
Give him water. They retired
together and went back to India
don't fight and
break their friendship
If you don't want to marry,
decide it right now
I never said I don't want to marry
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll take you
out for movies twice a week...
I'll take you out
thrice for dinner, and...
your birthday is on the 27th.
See, I remember, I didn't forget
On that day I'll be with
you from morning to evening
And I'll only take
your pictures. Okay?
If only you keep your promise!
- The day you become a doctor...
I'll send the two of you to India
and get your married. Now don't belch!
Maggie didn't come today

He's senior, you are junior. Dig that?
Shyam come, we got to talk.
- Thank you, sir
Move it
what crap! How can he get an award?
Sir, you know that he's a
bad shot, but you guys...
He holds a camera like
he's holding a coconut
I know you guys well. The two
of you hardly know photography
But he gets an award!
- Sir, he's a fraud! A cheat
He steals
photographs for competitions
I know where he stole
those photographs from
But he's made our
magazine Garam Masala famous
Sir, I will fight. I
will not leave this
This war has to be...
- Shut up!
Silence, idiot
This hunger has
heated up your brains
Attend tonight's party and stuff
yourself. It will cool your brains
But I will fight
Out you go!
I will fight.
He stole my heart on the sly
Lord, he took my heart away
He made me belong to him,
showed me beautiful dreams...
...and took my heart away
On the sly...
...he stole my heart
On the sly... he stole my heart
My love, you are handsome
You fascinate me
You are mine
My love, you are handsome
You fascinate me
You are mine
You have set my heart racing
You have robbed me of my peace
At the very first sight,
my heart writhed in agony
On the sly...
you stole my heart
On the sly...
you stole my heart
My love, the
fragrance of your breath...
and the magic in your words...
make me lose my composure
My love, the
fragrance of your breath...
and the magic in your words...
make me lose my composure
I don't know when I fell in love
I don't know when I gave in
You looked into my eyes...
and said a thousand things
On the sly...
you stole my heart
On the sly...
you stole my heart
You stole my heart on the sly
Lord, she took my heart away
On the sly...
you stole my heart
On the sly you stole my heart
Ladies and gentlemen, we
dedicate this evening to Shyam
Friends, I'm happy that...
Shyam has brought glory to
our magazine Garam Masala
Glory that makes it
hotter and spicier
On behalf of the company,
we congratulate Shyam
we also pray for the
success of his American trip
So Shyam's here's to you...
a Bon Voyage.
Thank you, sir.
Bon voyage, my foot!
Bloody freeloader
A free trip to America for
stealing photographs. Moron
don't you guys have self-respect?
Why are you clapping? Are you crazy?
This friendship...
...we shall never break
Stop singing, will you? Stop it
don't sing on friendship,
please! Stop it
Sing something else.
- Sing what?
I'll sing
You are made neither for
the earth nor for the sky
what makes you sing melancholy?
- Your identity is...
why pick a rotten song?
Forget your friend.
He stole pictures...
...won an award and
flew off, didn't he?
So hear me. If you play the music
of honesty, you will go deaf someday
Someone rightly said. Behind every
bit of luck there's a horrible crime
whose line was it?
- Not mine. Carry on
whoever said that, he was right
Money is truth. If you have money,
you have everything. Else, nothing
You lost your house, your motorbike,
your girl... they belong to him now
Moreover, he is your boss now.
Don't you want to defeat him?
If I have my way...
...l'll build a villa opposite
the house he snatched from me
I'll have three imported cars
for the motorbike he took away
I'll snatch all his girlfriends
away for taking my girlfriend Maggie
But how's that possible? The
girls we like, never like us
And the girls who like us,
who cares about them?
Don't worry about girls, moron.
I'll introduce you to beauties
But wait, I'm not
running a home of charity
My help doesn't come for free
I know, freeloader
How wide does your mouth open?
- The size of your pocket
But look, today's girls don't
care for looks but for bank balance
They look at the house, the car
and the credit cards you possess
You dig, Romeo?
Hi.
- Please sit
He's the one who waits outside the
airport for you. Been a year now
just to meet you, just to say hello
This is pooja.
Airhostess. She works for Fast Air
Hi. I'm Makrand
Hi. I'm Sweety from HiFi Airways
You can call me Mac.
- I'm deepti, from jet Speed Airways
God spins the wheels
of fortune really well
He turns a king into a
pauper and a pauper into a king
It's not God who spun
the wheels. It's the fatso
The chief editor. He helped me
whatever. When Shyam returns,
he will boss you around
And you'll have to obey him
quietly. - That's not worrying me
But, Maggie kissed him before me!
Well, I got three chicks now
Maggie looks like a noodle before
them. - Where did you find them?
Why do you worry about that? You
were supposed to show me a house
Yes, the house...
Stop droning. Tell me where it is.
- There is one
where?
- You'll have to cheat
I don't want to be jailed. Don't
get me into wrong things. Tell me...
where do I find a house?
- There's no risk
My ex-boss' flat's always empty.
He had bought it for his daughter
She now lives in America.
The babe's real hot!
But she is not straight, you know.
She lives with a black guy...
hasn't married yet. And her
father doesn't even know about it
Let me tell you the biggest risk
Forget it.
- Tell me
I won't tell anyone, I swear.
- I mustn't talk about the girl...
Not the girl! About the house!
- The flat is always empty
He is looking for a caretaker.
If you can turn him
around and get the job...
the flat will be yours.
- So take me to him
If you take me, you'll never get
the flat. Rather you'll be thrashed
why will he hit me?
- The man is ruthless, I say
I had run up a debt at a liquor bar,
so I sold the tyres of his Mercedes
I thought I'll put the tyres
back when I have the money
He fired me over such a minor
thing. The bloody sonofagun!
All right, listen to me
I'll fix the old man. But I
need a car for those beauties
don't worry about the car.
I'll give you a car...
prettier than the girls.
But you won't get the same
car daily. No guarantees
Never mind. - Tell your
girls you got several cars
Listen...
- Yes?
No liquor, no cars.
Just steering wheels
You are crazy!
Name?
- Makrand Godbole. They call me Mac
what work do you do?
- I'm looking for a job
But I want to tell you
a sad story about me
So you are a writer?
- No, sir
parents, siblings, uncle and aunts...
they are all I have in this world
I'm their only support
So what can I do?
What can you do? Give me work, sir
know how to drive?
- I know. But I don't drive
My horoscope predicts a major
accident if I drive for someone
do you cook? - I do, but I
always add too much salt
what can you do then?
Can you take care of a house?
- That I can do very well
I don't normally trust strangers
But you seem to be
from a good family
I'm always out of the country
I got a flat at port Louis.
Collect the key from me tomorrow
who?
- Open up
who's that?
I told you about him
didn't I tell you? He's Mambo
call him here
Uncle, he is Mr.
Makrand. People call him Mac
Hello.
- Attitude problem
did you tell him?
- Explained him everything
Told him about me?
- Clearly
I want a mixer, I
don't make chutney...
...I want a grinder, I
can't knead dough...
I want a gas stove,
no outdated stoves.
Washing machine.
Doesn't wash clothes
He wants a dishwasher...
...and a huge fridge,
because he can't cook everyday
Television. - If cricket
is on, he'll cook at night
If it's a day-night match,
you will order something
I will go to the market, and
nobody questions me about accounts
Sure. Anything else? That's all?
Can I talk now?
- Sure
Actually... we are young people
we play around and have fun. So...
I don't want any interference.
- I don't care. Do as you like
My demands have to be met and I
must get my pay check on the 1 st
Fine. You are appointed
when we first met, I was
wondering where I've seen you before
Then I remembered where
You are the girl I dreamt about
know what this is?
- What?
A ring. A ring that passed down...
...from my great
grandmother to my grandmother
From my grandmother to
my mother and then to me
I was told to give it to my
life partner whenever I meet her
And guess what? God heard my
prayers and He gave me a life partner
Really?
What are you doing?
Why did you take it off?
You are my fiancee now. I'll
give it to you the day we marry
After that, this ring will
always shine on your finger
So sweet
chhagan!
Drive
Babban!
Stop
come on
know what this is?
- A ring
But it's a very special ring
A ring that was passed down from my
great grandmother to my grandmother
From my grandmother to
my mother and then to me
I was told to give it to my
life partner whenever I meet her
That's what I'm doing now
what are you doing?
Now that you are my fiancee,
I'll give it to you the day we marry
After that, this ring will
always shine on your finger
I love you. Mac.
- Control... c'mon!
Your fingers looks so bare
know what? This ring passed down...
...from my great
grandmother to my grandmother
From my grandmother to
my mother and then to me
I was told to give it to my
life partner whenever I meet her
And I found you. I'm so happy
No... not now...
why?
- You are my fiancée now
I'll give it to you the day we marry
Let me go.
- Feeling shy, eh?
Indian girls are great
I see the sky...
I see the earth...
wherever I see...
I find you
I see the sky...
I see the earth...
wherever I see...
I find you
In every spectacle, I see you
There's no place...
where I don't find you
who lent elegance...
...to this marblesque body...?
To these dreamy eyes...?
To this beautiful face?
You are my destination
You are my desire
The Spring...
the marvels...
and the stars, without you...
I have never seen them
I see the sky...
I see the earth...
wherever I see...
I find you
You're mine... and only you...
You make my dreams come true...
I want only you... girl, only you...
I love you... Iove you...
Iove you... only you...
From your eyes flows...
a strange intoxication
dazes one and all
It's an incredible moment
Your radiance captivates me
You are my only obsession
My love...
I shall...
never find...
a beauty like you
I see the sky...
I see the earth...
wherever I see...
I find you
pooja...
- Honey, I'm here
There! Hurry up, or we'll be late
I'm sorry, I started without you.
- Never mind. No formalities.
Thank you. When are you coming
back? - The day after tomorrow
The day after tomorrow
By which flight? - IA 9436
The Mumbai flight that flies back?
- Right
when will you be leaving?
- Next day
Next day. Okay
Tell me something, honey.
What do you keep writing?
Do you think you are a pilot? You
keep track of every minute of mine
Business is stressing, and I'm
busy. I have to sort things out
So that when you come home,
I can spend time with you
we can be together. Water please
Mambo!
Make two cups of tea!
- Making tea is not that easy
It's a tough job. Look at me!
You got to light the gas stove...
boil water, put tea-leaves,
add sugar and milk to make tea
prayers don't grant you tea!
- Mambo!
Don't you talk about prayers!
Go and get some tea
don't you scream at me! I'm not deaf
Hear that? He has scissors for a
tongue. I told you to fire him
why don't you kick him out?
- It's no good
The poor man is fickle-minded.
Just yesterday he was praising you
Lies! He never praises me
when I first came here,
he treated me like a guest
But now he acts as if
he's doing me a favour
Listen, you are mistaken
He is like an old man
fed up of his children
You get me? He's like your father.
His heart's full of love
So why does he hide it? Why
can't he be like us, honey?
How can he be like us?
He's an old man...
about to hit the grave.
To hell with the old man
who is an old man? Did
you call me an old man?
Who called you old man? - I'm
not deaf. You called me old man
Yes, he said that. So what are you
going to do? Will he call you a kid?
Damn you! Your father
might be an old man!
She's going to down a plane
someday. Calls me an old man!
Airplane, my foot! She
can't even ride a bicycle
I have told you!
Shut your ears. Please
Say you will.
- Eyes shut, ears shut!
Go and get the lady's bag.
- My eyes are shut
Open your eyes for five seconds.
- If I find her bag in time, fine
Or she leaves without her bag.
- Don't talk back
I warned him. See, he
quietly went to get your bag
Mambo, quick
Honey, I'll miss you a lot.
- Even I'll miss you
I don't feel like going.
- Go on, you need to work
Go now, come on. Don't keep
standing for too long. Bye
where's she now?
Did I keep you waiting?
- No. I came only a minute ago
But that one minute
felt like a hundred years
come, let's go.
- My bag
Okay lets go.
- Come.
One leaves, another comes.
Bangkok departure, Singapore arrival
Every time I come here, I see
that man in the same position
don't you keep him busy? You
are too lenient towards him
what are you hiding?
- Nothing
Then why are your hands behind you?
- It's his style. Never mind
why doesn't he show it?
I want to see it
I can't show it.
- I want to see. - Take her away
No whispering! I don't want
to see it. keep it with you
Let's go to our room and chat.
Get into a nightgown...
No! I'm not leaving until
he shows what he is hiding
If I show you, there'll be a storm!
Come what may, I'm going to see it
You want to see it?
- Yes
You want to see it? I'll show it.
- Show
My pants are torn, and
I'm not wearing underwear
don't tell me I didn't
warn you. Want to see it?
Want to see it?
- Damn
Hold it
I guess I deserve a raise
In trying to save you...
...my pants are really
going to be ripped off someday
what are you cooking? I don't
want sandwiches. Make malai-kofta
what's this?
- Call it anything you wish
we call it mutton cutlet.
- What? For whom?
Mac only eats what I eat.
- Ask him
Yes, honey?
- Whom is the mutton cutlet for?
Mutton cutlet - why did he make it?
I think he has his way around here
How can you stand it?
- You are right
why did you make the mutton cutlet?
Who did you ask before making it?
You don't know who ate it?
- Do you eat mutton, Mac?
When did I eat mutton?
- Did I say you ate?
Then who ate it?
- Someone
who?
- Want me to remind you who did?
Tell me.
- The one who had omelette...
Hang on! I remember. Just
tell me if I am right or not
It was my friend Shyam.
- Shyam, who?
Shyam, who? He's my friend. He
came from America last night
when did he come? This morning
Oh yes, this morning.
The cutlet was made for him
I swear. You don't believe me?
Thank God you remembered
Mac, there's an email for you
From?
- Shyam
He's coming from America tomorrow.
- Shyam's coming from America?
You just said he had breakfast.
- Who told you?
Yes, I told you. But
this Shyam is not that one
who ate the mutton cutlet?
- That one's different
The Shyam who's coming is my
friend. - Then who is this Shyam?
Don't you know? You brought the
email! - Who is that Shyam then?
I have five friends named Shyam.
Do you know all of them?
I have five Shyams as friends,
and he knows just one.
He's crazy. He's very weird.
Snake in the grass! You
know when to grab a bite
I didn't get this email, you dig? I
don't want to talk to that ingrate
He wants you to
receive him at the airport
My dog will receive him!
- When did you get a dog?
Is that a joke?
- Look, he is your boss. You must go
can't you tell a
lie for your brother?
For a brother, yes. Of course,
with an open heart
Happily
Enough. I can't stand more happiness
My flight timings
are going to change.
We'll be flying only during daytime
what time is the arrival?
- I'll get to know today
I'm dead. Got to
rework the adjustments
what adjustments?
- No... my work schedule
I'll have to adjust my schedule
according to your flight timings
You take a bath
Nageshwar!
Yes? Tell me.
- Where's Mac?
I don't know. He's not
coming to the office either
I've been looking for him.
He doesn't even call me
I left three
messages at his office...
...but he didn't call me.
Please tell me
I got to attend an
urgent meeting. Bye
where are you going? One second
Listen to me...
You must tell me. Where's Mac?
- How can I tell you? I don't know
You are lying. I
know you can tell me
Say, how much is it worth?
So you'd care to grease the palm?
The work I do here... don't tell me
what people call this profession
But if I have to continue this,
you will have to double my salary
can we sit and discuss it?
- Mac!
What happened?
Anjali is coming.
- What...? Who the hell told...?
Who the hell told
her about this place?
- I don't know. I
saw her coming here
You were supposed to take me out for
a movie and dinner, what happened?
And now you have moved in here!
You didn't even care to call me
If you don't like me,
tell me Makrand!
- Don't call me Makrand. Call me Mac
And stop screaming. I
command some respect here
This house is not mine.
Belongs to my friend
My office snatched away my house.
After I find a new house...
I'll take you anywhere you want.
Restaurants, movies, anywhere
Galan...
what happened?
- Babban
Babban, see the lady off
But...
- Go on Hurry up
Hello? Mac here.
- Pooja here
why are you puffing?
- I was running
Running? What for?
- I mean, on the treadmill
There's a problem here. My
flight is delayed. I'm coming over
don't come here!
- Why are you yelling?
I thought we'd spend some
time together, but you...!
Try to understand. Why bother?
I'll come to the airport
No need. I've hired a cab already.
- To hell with the cab!
I'm coming to the airport, pooja...
Hello, Mac, hello!
- Bye.
Who was it?
A... relative
Relative? Who?
Close relative
close relative, who?
- He's like half-father to me
what...?
- He is my uncle
But you yelled pooja!
- I did
who was she?
- It was a male
How can a man's name be pooja?
- Why not?
He's my uncle pooja. Get that?
His name is poojari
kids used to tease him, so
he changed his name to pooja
That's uncle pooja!
- The biggest lie ever
why do you call him? He's
always busy in the kitchen
don't you trust me?
- No!
I swear by my father
Is he your father?
- Yes
You never told me. - You
never had interest in my family
This is when he was young...
with my mother
That's the naughty me.
- How sweet!
He even creates parents
Uncle pooja is coming,
I'm going to the airport
I got to talk business with him.
He'll be leaving by the next flight
I'll be back. Get dressed
or you will catch a cold
I'll be back
Listen carefully. The
Mumbai flight is delayed
If it lands here by chance,
don't let it meet the Bangkok flight
I don't want them both to collide
Because if they crash,
I'll die. Help me please
Mumbai flight hasn't taken off,
Bangkok flight is at home
If the Mumbai flight lands,
the Bangkok flight will...
damn!
Where's she?
Damn! I'm dead
Mac? You are here?
- Where were you going?
I was going to the taxi stand.
I'm famished, let's go home
Mambo has taken the day off.
Let's go to the airport canteen...
we'll have chicken breasts. Come on
Hello?
Is it early? All right,
I'll get to the airport
Mambo, don't cook
for me. I'm leaving
May I say something?
- Tell me
I think I must've done some
good deeds in my previous birth
That's why I get opportunities
to spend quality time with you
Honey, you really flatter me.
- That's the problem
If only I could rent my heart!
But you'll still think I'm lying
Hi Mac!
I've been looking for you. I
thought you came to receive me
Give me a hug
Go and sit there, we are busy.
- Hi
Hi. I'm pooja.
- We are best friends
we can even give up
our lives for each other
Not that best friends, okay!
Go and sit there
How can you say that?
- Join us
Hi
we used to work together. I got
the International photography award
Then I went to America...
- She is my fiancée
Fiancée?
- Yes
If you don't mind, we want
to discuss something private
Find another table, please.
- Carry on
You and I have no secrets
between us. She won't mind it
She knows the friendship we share.
- Such a pile on, you know
I have to report to my office.
- Okay
Because, I told them I'm
going home. - Okay, darling. Bye
where did you find that bombshell?
- Got to be handsome for that. You...
what happened?
What happened, Mac?
What are you doing down there?
I had lost my ring
How come you arrived early?
- I told you about change in timings
They called me suddenly. Departure
is rescheduled three hours earlier
Hi! I am Shyam from America.
- Hi! I am Sweaty.
This is my...
- Fiancée?
Yes.
- How do you know?
We've been friends since childhood.
We know each other's choices
why don't you sit?
- Move it
Here... here, darling.
- Okay
Easy
Is he the Shyam for whom
you made the breakfast...?
Yes... the breakfast... it's him
when are you coming back?
- Don't know
New schedule, new timings.
I'll know only after I return
I'm getting late, I got to go
Bye, Mac.
- Bye, take care.
You are indeed lucky. I
have seen fate look up
But this is incredible!
You are very lucky
Trust me...
- Mac, I got to leave
It's time for my flight.
Love you, honey
Ok. Bye. Bye. _ Take care.
- Take care.
Where do you think you are going?
- Incredible setup
I can add spice to this setup
There's my stuff. Let's
take that to your house
Then we'll fix half a dozen girls.
We're brothers, after all
Get lost. Don't touch me.
- Well?
One cold coffee
Swine! You cheated for that award.
And then you forgot me
Then you got promoted and
flew off to America, all alone
You went blind, didn't you? I
decided then, to end our friendship
You go your way, I go mine
Excuse me! My bill. Coffee, separate
Listen... listen...
Friend...
damn you!
When did you come?
I'll explain later.
First tell me where Mac is
His life's totally changed.
He's a high-flying guy nowadays!
He has a posh flat,
exquisite, expensive furniture...
three hot babes at his
beck and call. What a blast!
How times have changed for him!
- Lucky dog!
So take me to him. Why don't you?
Haven't you met him yet?
- How could I?
I don't even know where he lives.
- Walk into his office and meet him
But how can I go to
his office in this state?
I've just arrived from America
Look, Babban. Mac is
a close buddy of mine
Even if I'm his senior today,
he used to be my senior once!
Look, I've got such a lot of
stuff for him from America
I can't sleep in the night,
wondering how he could be managing
Stop worrying about him! He's
doing just fine wherever he is
come with me, Babban. I've
got some stuff for you too
No, you must be lying.
- Lying?
I've brought three
bottles of English liquor!
What'll I do with empty bottles?
It should have booze!
Empty bottles? They're
sealed bottles... full of liquor!
Really? Let me see!
Actually, it's under
all the stuff there.
I'll give it to you at Mac's place
You mean it?
- Oh yes. And some dough, too
All right, let's go.
- Okay
Speak up!
Who's this mad dog?
Uncle Mambo...
- That's my name! What's his?
Who on earth is he?
- Uncle Mambo!
The master key to this house!
So you're Uncle Mambo...?
You're just like he described you
in his mail. You haven't changed
The same nose,
eyes, vest and undies!
I change my undies everyday!
Who the devil is he?
Uncle, this is Shyam.
Everybody calls him Sam
Mac's friend. He has
just arrived from America
But why've you come with bag and
baggage? - Hasn't he told you?
Who?
- My chum. I'm going to stay here
No way... no! My sofa...!
He forgot to
receive me at the airport
I was so angry... sorry!
- Are you blind?
Can't you see anything?
- He can, it's just a mistake
I was actually so angry, I thought
I wouldn't set foot in this house
You haven't unpacked yet.
Better you get going!
If I go away, he'll be
back to his old dramatics
He'll fall at my feet,
cry... The forgetful idiot!
Wrong! He never forgets!
By the way, which room
did he ask you to take?
But you haven't even met him yet.
- Oh yes, I haven't met him
know what? Just give me a nice room
Nice room? You want to buy it?
Are you married?
- No. Not right yet
But I'm looking out.
- What could be worse than this?
No, not that one. That's
the bedroom he works in
And that is a
bedroom he does not work in
He only sleeps in that bedroom.
Simply relaxes
So many rooms! Is
this a house or a hotel?
Even these rooms aren't enough for
him. - So where am I going to stay?
There is a room for you...
butt's a bit too large
That's okay. It'll do.
- Will do?
No problem!
- Follow me then
Go on... beat it now.
- What? Empty-handed?
Take all there is in
this pocket of mine
Only 2 rupees...?
- Why? Is that too much?
Never mind. keep it.
- Filthy miser!
Here, keep the 2 bucks.
I'll give you 50 paise more!
Okay? And you said you got
something for me from America!
It's there for you. But I'm
not giving it to you right now
I'll give it at an
appropriate time. - Really?
If that appropriate time does not
arrive, I'll tell Mac everything...
and your bad times will begin.
Just you remember that!
And listen! If I can fix a
car that has broken down...
I can also wreck a proper car!
Thank you.
Hello?
- Deepti
deepti, listen... I can't
go to the airport. I'm busy
Go straight home, I'll be there
I love you. Bye
who are you? How dare you kiss me?
That could've been my question.
But I'm not heartless like you
I hate debts. I repay every bit
Shut up! Who are you? And
what are you doing in my house?
That's my question.
- This is my house!
This is my best friend's house.
- Who?
Makrand deendayal chatpatiya.
- Are you Makrand's friend?
Yes. Now tell me,
how's this your house?
I'm Mac's Fiancée
I see. So you are the girl
who's going to marry Mac
Aren't you ashamed
to kiss a stranger?
I thought it was Mac. But you
knew it! Then why did you do it?
Aren't you ashamed to kiss
a girl you don't even know?
I thought it was Mac.
- And when I was screaming...?
Can't you recognize a girl's voice?
- I thought it was Mac laughing
All right, just forget it
It was a mistake. Now that we
know each other, why don't we do it?
What...?
Two negatives add up to a positive
As a poet said, yesterday's
mistake is today's culture...
and tomorrow's law.
- Did you really think I was Mac?
If it's true, I'll forgive you
Even if you forgive me,
I can't forget your touch
I'm a rich bachelor
But I have never
consciously looked at a girl
So?
- I love you
I'm engaged. You dig?
My feelings...
I was just telling her
how much Mac loved her
You tell her you love her, and she'll
know how much Mac loves her. Right
I mean, Mac told me to tell her...
how much he loves her...
- Enough. Don't try hard
Uncle...
I'm not anybody's uncle!
- Ass!
What...?
- One who calls you uncle is an ass
what style, what personality...
what must be your age?
Thirty-five? Thirty...?
A bit older
But if you discount all the
holidays, it comes to that much
You are young
You don't need to tell Mac
about what you just saw and heard
Forget Mac, I don't
even tell myself...
...about what goes on
around here. So relax
Thank you, uncle.
- Ass! You are an ass
You called me uncle
donkey
Intruder!
- Here you are, my friend!
Where were you? You kept me waiting
Hands off! Are you crazy?
- Tell me, please
Tell what? Hands off!
See his style? He loves me so much
what love? Have you done
anything worthwhile for me?
Why must you hide it from uncle?
He knows everything
Even I know you in
and out! I hate you
Hands off! Get out of here
Get out of here! Out
No matter what you say, but
my love for you is growing
It's growing here too.
Not love but the itch
Get out of here, or...
- Or what?
Let go of my hand or
I'll break your teeth
what's that?
- My cheeks
what's on your cheeks?
Blood.
- How come?
I had a shave this morning,
nicked myself and it bled
In the morning! And
it's grown already?
Did you use a tonic for a cream?
What the hell is that? - I
stopped shaving after I got the cut
How come your blood is scented?
- Few good people have scented blood
cut the crap! Get lost
where's the phone?
Was deepti here?
Where's the phone?
Has deepti come yet?
Anjali here.
- Anjali, who?
What...?
How are you?
- You've forgotten me
I'm not a fool to forget you. -
Then tell me, what day is it today?
Today? Today...?
It's Sunday.
- Did I ask you, swine?
It's Sunday!
I know it's Sunday.
But what's special today?
What's special... today...?
Is it Gandhi's birthday?
- No! It's my birthday
And you forget that! You
never remember my birthday, Mac
don't cry. I knew it!
Happy birthday to you
Then why didn't you come to
meet me? - You see, I got busy
So I couldn't come. You know,
I had been to the airport
Airport? Why did you go to the
airport? Isn't it Sunday today?
Yes, today is Sunday
and your birthday too
All the shops are closed, only the
duty free shop at the airport is open
I went there to buy a beautiful,
strong and reliable gift for you
I got... damn!
- What happened?
I'll call back later! - What
happened, Mac? You're coughing
who was it?
- It was...
what happened to your voice?
- Sore throat
Anyway, there's good news for you.
- What?
My flight timings are changing.
- When?
You had a sore throat!
- It's fine now. When?
It will land at 7:30 from tomorrow.
You mean you'll
come 3 hours earlier?
I mean, we'll get 3 more hours
Tell me something. Only your
airlines have changed timings? Or all?
All the airlines.
- Thank God, I'm saved
Saved? From what?
What?
- You said, you are saved
when did I say that?
- You just did
No darling, I didn't say that. -
You said! You said it! You did too!
Why'd I say that I'm saved?
- You did say that. I heard it too
Hear that?
- Are you crazy?
I swear, I didn't say that.
This guy is crazy
when did I say it? I don't
like your face! I'll kill you
I'll shave your head!
Who is Sweety?
Sweety? Who? Wherefrom? Which one?
Sweety Nair! This
letter is addressed to her
I want to know who she is.
- Mailed to my address?
Yes, your address.
- You are not Sweety Nair?
How come someone else's
letter is dropped here?
Look here! What?
- Nothing
It's your address. Sweety Nair,
13th floor, flat no.1...
Balla Vista, port Louis, Mauritius.
- I don't know who she is
I forgot to tell you about it.
- Who is Sweety Nair?
Wrong address. It came earlier too.
It's for a guy downstairs
Urmila's younger sister kokila...
her son is Bakul. Bakul's uncle...
was married to Rasila... it's
their daughter-in-law's daughter
The postman said no one
was answering the door
I gave him a glass of water, he
told me to give them the letter
I said, I will. So you see,
this is his daughter... Sweety
damn this day
It's so embarrassing. My
own Fiancée suspects me
Sweety Nair! know
who Sweety Nair is?
A 12-year old girl.
She's played in my lap
I'm so sorry...
come here.
- Don't do it again.
I'm so happy we're back.
The old fossil ruined it
what's your intention?
Had you been a Muslim...
I would read that
you can have four wives
But which law offers
this facility for Hindus?
Not wives. Fiancées
do you know about
this Fiancée thing?
Fiancée is a facility that provides
everything that a wife provides
Except the nightmares
Take good care of women, and
you'll get the greatest intoxication
what are you doing here?
Didn't I ask you to leave? You
are guzzling my liquor, freeloader
Get out of here.
- How will you manage three women?
How can I leave you alone
in this mess, my friend?
You don't need to worry. I've
been doing it since my childhood
I'm really worried for you.
- Hands off!
You are not worried! You are jealous
Get out of here! Out!
- Where do I go?
Where you kicked me out from!
- There's no tap in the bathroom
The roof is broken, no pipes.
It's being fixed
I'll go there as soon as
it is fixed. Promise. Please
promise?
- Promise
what happened?
You consider me a stranger,
it hurts, friend
But buddy, you will
never find a friend like me
Shake hands on that

Fake, all of them! Local stuff
is better than the imported one
Anyway, talk business
Babban, tell you something. A
friend in need is a friend indeed
Stop beating about the
bush and come to the point
lmagine me in that
house instead of Mac
How's that possible?
- Just imagine
All right, done.
- I take the girls
what...?
- Just imagine
done. What next?
- Now just imagine this
I pay you more
than what Mac pays you
That's a really wild fantasy.
- Just imagine
Only imagine? Done
can you do for me
what you do for him?
Gotcha!
So you want to ruin his setups?
- Oh no
Suppose he is transferred. The
ladies' bar he has set up...
with much difficulty, it
has to be kept going, you see
damn, you are my dearest friend!
One wouldn't need a foe if he has
a friend like you. You are enough
Listen... if I have my
share of liquor everyday...
then you don't need to
worry about me. - Promise?
Promise
Shake!
- One minute
First, tell me who gave
him that grand apartment?
Money is not a problem.
Mac's transfer is all I want
If possible, to the
India-pakistan border
who do I talk to about this?
- I hate to praise myself
I have high connections. My
word means more than the big boss'
You know that very well.
You get the dough
You are the best person for such
crooked tasks. It shows on your face
don't worry about
the money. Do the job
Forget the job, get the money.
- It'll be done
promise?
- Promise
Hello Maggie... connect me to Mac.
Your enemy is
bribing me to expose you
He wants to be the captain
of your three-in-one-day
All right. I'll keep an eye on him.
- keep an eye on my pockets too
I'm doing this for money. Get that?
Strange. People hang up
at the mention of money
No
No... Scotch?
No.
- Imagine it's medicine
Medicine, yes
with soda?
- Yes
Good
Tell me something
what time do you get up?
At six? Five? Four?
At four.
- Four?
So you've been up since long.
You need some rest, right?
How can I rest? I'm paid for my work
I must work. My father was in
the army. I follow the discipline
Even at this age, he
makes you slog like an ass
what does he pay for it? Zilch!
You are right, but I
don't take it seriously
I take it as a joke.
- That's your problem
In his place, I'd pay you more,
pay you more respect too
damn you! You are here to screw me!
I'll hack you to pieces!
I'll hang you up on the fan
don't you interfere, old fossil
wait there, don't you leave!
You are dead, Shyam!
You want to kick me
out and stay here, eh?
What are you doing?
- Damn you!
You plan to have my Fiancée,
eh? Bloody lecher
plotting, eh?
Get out of here with your stuff!
Pick up your stuff and get lost!
Please don't!
Think again!
- Thought! Move it
Is this your final decision?
- The ultimate
Out!
- Goodbye
what's his name...? Padgaonkar
He might have an
apartment like this. - What?
Nothing
what's his address? Bungalow no.
3, Tulip citadel, Grobe Road... yes!
What? What did you say? - Nothing.
I too need a house to live
what's his name...?
- Padgaonkar
Yes. Padgaonkar. If I
could get a house like this...
put your stuff down!
You are not an orphan
You don't need to tell others
when there's a brawl in the family
I need to talk to him. - Are
you his business partner? Silly
Let go of me!
Ma says, never retract your steps
But retracting for a friend
proves friendship. Dad said that
crap. If we spend more
time with each other...
we might end up killing each other.
- Can I even hit you?
You can hit me... go on.
Am I complaining?
Just remember. You'll never
find a true friend like me
Really?
- Really
Shake hands
How about a Blue Label on the
occasion? - I don't have Blue Label
It's there. I have
seen it down there
Swine! Bloody snooper
I'm leaving. Bye
where are you leaving?
We've stopped fighting
I can't take it anymore. I quit!
- Did I tell you something?
You are like daddy. - Daddy? Swine,
old fossil, senile...
is that what you call your father?
- Who is the master of the house?
On my face
You are.
- Correct. And who is the swine?
Who is the swine here?
- Who do you call a swine?
Who?
- It's the wife's brother
That's family. That makes you family
we love you. Did you
think I was cursing you?
How silly
just a while ago he
hit me... did I complain?
No, because I love him. Such
things happen between friends
Make a drink of Blue
Label for uncle, fast
I'm not drinking.
- Why not? You will
Get on with it!
- Sure
Let go
Hurry up
One for me!
Cheers! Cheers!
My heart... as vast as the sea
Let me immerse you
in my heart, my love
My heart... as vast as the sea
Let me immerse you
in my heart, my love
There's something I
have to tell you...
I wish to ride
these waves, my love
lmmersed... my heart's immersed
lmmersed... the
heart's immersed, sweetheart
lmmersed... my heart's immersed
lmmersed... the
heart's immersed, sweetheart
In your mischievous eyes,
on your breath...
there's the requital to love
My desires, consumed by a storm...
there's the desire to love
In the depths of my craving...
I'm in a daze, my love
lmmersed... my heart's immersed
lmmersed... the
heart's immersed, sweetheart
My heart... as vast as the sea
come, let me give
you all I possess
If youth is fire...
Iove is the water
that extinguishes it
It's true, my love,
better you understand that
This restlessness
is like a tempest...
believe me, my love
In your arms, I
want to be, my love
lmmersed... my heart's immersed
lmmersed... the
heart's immersed, sweetheart
My heart... as vast as the sea
come, let me
immerse you in my heart
All I have to say is that I
want to ride these waves...
O my love!
Lmmersed... my heart's immersed
lmmersed... the
heart's immersed, sweetheart
Brother Makrand!
Yes, that's it
You're screwed!
- What happened?
Your fiancée's
arriving with a rotten fly
Looks like he's related to you.
- Rotten-faced? Sucked-out mango?
That's my uncle
what happened, Mac?
- Pooja, wear your clothes quickly
My Uncle will arrive any moment,
I'm terribly scared of him
He's like a father to me.
He's coming to meet you actually
So get ready quickly.
- All right
Listen... don't always rush.
Hear me out first!
There's a girl with him...
she's like a sister to me
So no misunderstandings, okay?
- Why would I misunderstand?
Actually, it was only for your
information, okay? So go on... hurry
Let's go! Quick!
My respects, Uncle
You ought to have called,
I'd have picked you up
which flight did you take?
- From that traffic signal...
to this one, I need a flight?
- I told you!
My Uncle never
gives a straight reply!
Uncle, this is my friend Shyam.
Shyam, that's Uncle. Say hello, son
This house, Uncle... it's
my friend's, it's not rented
And this guy...
- Babban
Babban. He's my driver.
- Driver? When did you buy a car?
Actually, the car I have,
isn't one I've bought
The company I work for gave
it to me. - Very big company!
Very big company. Come
on inside, Uncle. Please
welcome, Uncle
You must actually be wondering
what I'm doing here. My friend...
who? - The guy in the
red shirt, long hair
Shyam. His sister has a brain
tumor. Any moment now, she could...
As if you're treating her!
I told you! My Uncle
never Gives a straight reply!
The last time he cracked
a joke, I vomited blood!
Uncle, you're too much.
- Shut up!
What have I said for you
guys to laugh so much?
You really want to know?
- Yes!
know what, Uncle? We never
laugh in this house... we only cry
His sister's struggling
between life and death
Any moment, she could... you
know why I'm sticking around here?
It's to give my friend moral support
what's happening here?
She's got very few days to live.
So she goes for the elders' feet
She has a lot of respect for you.
The way she looks,
it doesn't seem...
A well-fed punjabi girl, you see!
- Did someone call me?
Yes... make some tea
And guess who this is...?
- The one who'll drink the tea
He's my Uncle!
I've come to ask you
just one question.
Are you serious about the marriage?
Of course. - All right then,
I'll make arrangements
If anybody has anything to say...
say it right now. Am I right?
I have nothing to say.
You can do as you wish
It's all arranged then! Get on
with the arrangements for the wedding
we're willing!
- Who's we?
All of us are ready!
- All right
Are you happy?
- Yes
All right. I'm leaving then
At least have tea before you leave.
- Are you out of your mind?
Tea for Uncle? Uncle
will straightaway...
...sip champagne at my wedding party!
Do not worry, my child.
Everything will be all right
Everything will be all right!
Show him out...
my respects, Uncle!
And what are you up to?
- Mac darling!
This way, Uncle... please come.
I'll give you a ride
in the company's car
I'm going in a taxi!
- No, not a taxi!
You'll get stuck in a jam, sir!
- Don't teach me!
If I can come, I can also leave
on my own! I don't need your help!
But I need your help, sir.
- I don't want it! No!
Think it over, sir... sir! -
Stop picking on my brains! Lmbecile!
Where did she spring from?
Get back in that car,
there's nobody at home!
No problem. - Problems
begin when you go upstairs!
Why?
- The door's locked!
I have the keys.
- But you can't do that... listen!
There's a different lock there!
At least listen to me!
He couldn't understand a thing!
How'll you open the door when
you don't even have the key?
What'll you do up there
when there's nobody at home?
When are you coming back?
- What...?
She's going to commit suicide. To
end her life... she's not coming back
what's that to you?
This guy's such a pile on!
At least listen to me!
- Shut up!
You could climb all over us!
Let's take the stairs... come on
He's going to be butchered today!
What happened?
- You saw...?
What did I see?
Did you see nothing?
- What's there to see, kiddo?
What?
Get that car out, else you're the
one I'll see... c'mon now, move it
Hey... Hello.
Hi!
Have you taken the day off today?
- Yes, this is my day off
It's great, isn't it? My
flight timings have changed
I can now come back home early. -
Sure, but that's a problem for others
How...?
- It changes our timings, too
what timings? It was done for
the convenience of the passengers
And they love the change.
- Maybe
But I know people who have
a lot of problems with it
who has problems?
- A friend of mine
why?
Your earlier timings
were just right for him
The airline can't
keep everybody happy
what happened?
What's up...?
- I don't know
It happened once earlier when
I was getting off the flight
If you wish, may I...
- what?
Nothing... forget it.
- What is it, Sam?
You won't misunderstand if I
say something, will you...?
What?
- You'll get me all wrong
I won't!
- You're sure?
My papa used to be an
expert at pulling legs
what? Was he a thug?
- No! He was a masseur
He used to relieve
pain by pulling the leg
My fingers possess the same magic.
Want me to work on you?
Do what it takes, Sam.
Just drive this pain away
Go in there, change and lie down.
I'll fetch some oil!
What happened...?
Want me to carry you?
Vanished!
- What's vanished?
The pain has vanished.
- Vanished...? Lmpossible!
Do this!
Do this!
Try this!
How did the pain vanish so easily?
- It has vanished
just why I hate this back-ache!
Mac, this is deepti.
- Deepti who?
From the airport.
- Airport...? Oh yes!
Stay right there. I'm coming over
Sir, the gate's over there.
- Oh, damn my memory!
You hit me...?!
- Let go of my collar!
You're pushing me...?
- Go ahead... bump him off
The Singapore flight has landed!
There's no timing for them
The Singapore flight lands,
the Bangkok flight takes off!
It's like managing an airport...
- He just doesn't understand...
Look, he's still here.
Sam, when did you come?
- I've been here a long time
I'm really famished! Let
me see what's there to eat
we have a problem...
- what are you up to? Lay off!
How often have I told you not
to bring mutton into the house?
Mutton...? Meet my friend. Sam.
- I know him already
why did you introduce me again?
- Because he's the meat-eater!
I'm sick of reasoning with him!
Why do you eat mutton...?
No, that's no big problem.
- How's that possible?
The stink has spread all over
the house. I can't eat here anymore
No problem, darling.
Let's go out and eat
Very good idea! Make
sure you go out to eat!
Especially in dangerous
situations... - dangerous?
I mean, the stink of mutton has
spread all over the house, hasn't it?
It's very bad for health!
It could even cause nose-cancer.
- Really?
Really! I swear it on everybody!
Myself, my dad, mom...
Your friend comes
up with lovely jokes
I'm the one who's
told him all these jokes
But timing is of essence!
Must know when to say what!
Hurry up... you know how difficult
it is to find a table? Go on!
I'll just change my shirt.
This one is stinking
First grab a bite.
Change that shirt later
Lay off, will you?
- You don't know...
don't tell me. I know everything!
- Listen to me, Mac...
Are you going to
watch while I change?
Quickly change!
Else you'll pay a heavy price!
What's this?
- What?
Whose is this lady's bag?
Whose...? It's mine!
- Yours?
Actually, I have unusual tastes.
It has my mobile,
watch, shaving cream...
brush, blush...
everything. Aren't you getting ready?
What for?
- For the dinner?
I think I'm not going.
- Why not? Such a lovely evening...
don't you like going out with Mac?
- I'm sick of eating out
But how can you eat here?
- Why not?
I mean, I'm not talking
about the usual roadside eateries
lmagine a lovely restaurant,
eating a dinner in candlelight...
...the soft music... it's all so
romantic. So you're going, aren't you?
No! I'm eating right here.
- Like hell!
I mean, how can you eat
in such a filthy setting?
You must go out!
- Don't force deepti...
if she doesn't want to go out!
Whatever deepti wants will happen!
We'll go to the restaurant if
she wants to go. Else, we won't!
Don't you know how to
behave with a friend's fiancée?
Aren't you ashamed of?
- You must go to the restaurant!
We're not going! What
are you going to do?
A friend's true worth you'll know...
- I know your two-penny worth!
Whatever you say, you're
not eating in this house!
You're going out! Even
if I have to lose my life!
Why are you fighting over me?
Let's go to a restaurant
No, we're not going!
We're eating right here!
Are you guys eating here? - Yes,
we'll stuff ourselves right here!
The three of you,
you mean. Not everybody
what do you mean by everybody?
There are just three of us here!
What the hell! Why
are you hitting me?
If somebody asks me to
make something else later...
I won't be able to do it
One moment. We'll cook
what deepti wants today
You want to eat cheese?
- Sure
what if somebody else asks me
to make something else later?
But who else is around?
- He knows
And why don't I know...?
What is the problem with you?
Look, I don't have the
strength anymore to...
forget it
I can't, you know...?
Better I cook and leave
did he have something to say?
- I'll explain!
He can't cook for all of us!
Exactly why I'm saying the two
of you will not eat here! Go out!
Forget it. Let's go out and eat.
- Sure. Let's go and eat
All right. I'll go and change
No... not in here! That room!
Why?
- That's a better room
Shyam, don't test my patience.
Else, I swear...
Exactly what I'm saying!
Trouble inside, trouble outside
what? What trouble...?
- Calm down, darling...
I'm going out of my mind!
What are you getting at...?
What?
Can't you still understand? - I
understand everything, you creep!
Leave him alone,
Mac! What are you doing?
He's making obscene gestures.
Like this...!
Why won't you let me go in?
- You want to know? I'll tell you!
I have personal things in there.
- What personal things?
Hairbrush, toothbrush,
towel... a whole lot of things
As if it'll kill you
if she sees all that!
That's not all. I've put half
a dozen undies up for drying
Two of them have holes!
I won't look at them.
- I don't trust you. What if you do?
Your goddamn undies...
- Leave him alone, Mac!
Don't get into a fight. I'll
go into another room. Okay?
Won't you at least hear me out...?
- I don't want to!
I hate going to prison,
else I'd have killed you!
I wanted to tell you...
- what...?
What's happening here?
The mains were
switched off and I escaped!
I was telling him that they took
off the main switch in the office...
and I escaped getting a shock.
But when did you come?
Just now. I wondered
what was happening here
You escaped this time.
But not forever! Good bye!
Hey, listen...
where are you going?
- I want to live!
And heart-attacks are
very common nowadays
Mac, what's happening here?
He's leaving us and
going away. Tell him to stay
why are you going?
I won't go, if you say
I didn't know you'd
be coming so early.
Must finish my work in the office
You'll leave me all alone?
- I'll be here with you
I'll come back soon. We'll
have a quiet dinner and...
The cheese-pakoda is ready
cheese-pakoda? Who is it for?
- Cheese-pakoda...?
It's for Shyam.
- Me?
He eats cheese four times a day!
Morning, afternoon, evening and night!
You'll bloat up like a buffalo!
No big wonder! He even
looks like a pakoda!
All right, throw it away!
We'll have only what Sweety likes
Throw it away! You
know how I hate pakodas
do the dishes immediately and
make curry and rice for everyone
what soup have I landed in...?
I'm always getting into this mess...
These fools play their own game
and I'm the one who gets hurt.
I'm going for my work-outs. - Yes,
darling! You build good health
I'll take care of the office!
And we'll have dinner together!
Let me go!
- So sweet!
Couldn't you tell me Sweety's here?
- As if you were listening!
Well? Haven't you guys
finished fighting yet?
We've made peace! Let's go and
eat dinner somewhere in peace
what made you change your mind? -
But you said you wanted to eat out!
Let's go!
- But I said that...
only to stop you from fighting!
Forget it, darling. Please!
No way! We're eating out!
But you said you'd do as I say!
- And that's what we'll really do
All I want is...
- The rice and curry is ready
Listen to me, will you? - Who
asked you to make rice and curry?
We planned to go to
a restaurant and...
the curry and rice was his idea!
He keeps hogging on it!
You're going to bloat like a rhino!
How much are you going to eat?
I'll have only cheese-pakodas.
- I've thrown that away
Threw it away? What for?
Because of him! He asked him to!
- I said I don't want it...
throw it away!
Our table is already booked.
So let's go and eat. Please!
Throw it all away
All right. I'll go and change
Step aside
what happened...?
- Gases! Smelly burps!
Must be acidity! I'll go
and fetch the medicine!
Where are my clothes? And you...?
You're still standing here?
I'm not going inside!
Can't you walk a bit faster? -
couldn't wear the clothes, could I?
Drink this. It's a little bitter
but it'll drive away the gases
Thank you.
- I'll take a shower
You think you're watching a
movie here? Get on with your work!
No movie, it's a farce!
Why are you taking a medicine?
- For him. He has gas problems
Hey no...
- drink it up! In one gulp!
He's going to lose all his gas.
- How's this dress?
Now go and call the elevator
up while I finish talking to him
But you guys just don't
seem to finish chatting!
Please, please!
- Okay, I'll get the lift up...
but I won't wait another minute.
- Okay, okay!
She's looking so ravishing!
- Never mind!
Before I return with deepti,
take Sweety out somewhere!
Will she go out with me?
- Think she's your sister-in-law!
My fiancée, after all!
She'll surely go with you!
Mac, you haven't left yet?
Please go and come back soon!
What will I do all alone...?
- My love!
She's back, she's back...
take to your heels!
I've had this lovely dream of
a house in the city of flowers
I won the first prize for
this song! - Do you really sing?
Of course! Do you like songs?
- Yes, I do
So let's go to a place
where they play great music
we'll have also dinner there.
What say you?
But Mac will be coming back.
- I don't think he's coming back
I haven't seen a heartless
man like him in all my life!
How could he go away to the office...
...leaving behind
such a lovely fiancée?
Had I been in his shoes and a
fire had broken out in my office...
I still wouldn't leave
you and go anywhere!
I don't know whether what I'm
doing is right... but do it, I must
I want to take you out to dinner
You're taking such good care of me.
- So you're coming, aren't you?
How can I refuse someone
who has such a large heart?
Thank you.
- I'll be ready in a moment
Bye!
- Hey...
where are you off to? - Who
the hell are you to question me?
But you said it was
child's play for you!
That the children are so
grown up, I had no idea
Before this game becomes...
...even more diabolic, I
must leave. Out of my way!
Mac's coming back. Please stay!
- Tell Mac that I have left!
What are you doing here?
- This is where I stay
what's there to be surprised about?
- Out of my way, I say
don't desert this ship! Lt'll sink!
Sunk or ripped apart, I don't care!
Get out of my way!
- Let him go, if he wants to
There's no use
having him here anyway! -
who the hell are
you to throw me out?
You're right!
- Who are you to order me around?
Try doing it where it works!
Let me see who throws me out!
She boards an aircraft a few
times and throws her weight around!
Where's Mac?
- I've no idea
I told him my flight
- timing had changed.
He must surely have forgotten
wrong! Wrong of him to forget!
Had I girlfriend like you,
I'd never have forgotten
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
- No, I don't have a girlfriend
The doors to my heart
are still open for her
Is there anything to eat?
Did you say something?
I didn't hear a word
can I have something to eat?
- How about a boiled elephant's egg?
He's out of his mind! know what?
Let's go and eat at a restaurant
As you wish. At least I won't
have to see that old fossil's face!
Not in here! That room, over there!
- Why not...?
This room's in a mess.
Needs to be cleaned up
Go and change in that room quickly.
- Okay
Hurry up... quick!
Sam, which restaurant are we
going to? - Wherever you say.
Whose bag is this?
- This... is my bag!
I carry my stuff in this bag. A
comb, ear-buds, talcum powder...
In a lady's bag?
- No, it's not a lady's bag
It's a lady's and gents' bag
which looks like a lady's bag!
It's nice, isn't it?
- Never mind. How's my dress?
You look amazing!
- What if I carried a scarf?
No, you don't need a scarf!
You're looking great anyway!
Just wait. I'll show you
Shall we...?
- I'm raring to go. Let's get going
why are you carrying my bag?
- This bag... is it yours?
I was admiring its beauty
And whose bag is this...?
- This one? This is mine, too!
I thought this bag was that
one and that one was this one...
so I picked that one up.
But this one is mine...
and that one is your bag! Let's go!
What confusion!
I ask for the last time. Who
wants to eat and who doesn't?
What do you want to eat, or
what don't you want to eat!
I am ready.
Listen to me... Sam!
No cheap snacks here. Get lost!
- Hang on, will you?
Sam...
- You can't go in
You take me for a beggar?
I have a car out there!
I can't let you in! Go!
Stop troubling us or
I'll call more security.
I wouldn't even pee in your hotel!
Do you have a mobile phone?
I'll have to call the
airport to tell them I'm here
Sorry, I forgot to carry it.
- That's okay
Let's call from the reception
If I haven't the right
to go into my own room...
...I don't want to live there!
Why are you pushing me...? Okay,
do it on your feet
Excuse me, can I make a
call please? - Wait please.
Pooja! Let's go to another hotel!
- But what for?
Don't you think this
place is stinking?
I can't smell anything.
- No? I knew you had caught a cold!
Nothing's wrong with me. Stay here,
I'll make the call and return
don't you trust me? Me?
Every time a plane flies
overhead I wonder when...
when my Sweety will arrive.
I mean, my deepti!
Deepti! Hear me out, please!
What the hell are you doing here?
- And what are you doing here?
Of the thousands of restaurants in
town, is this where you had to come?
Yes, of the thousands
of restaurants in town...
...is this where you had to come?
I'll smash your face! You imitate
me? - What the hell are you doing?
I'd have gone elsewhere if you
had told me you're coming here!
When's this mess
going to come to an end!
So where's Sweety?
- Not Sweety. Pooja
pooja! Where did she spring from?
- I was leaving the house...
and she just breezed in!
So I brought her here
And where is Sweety?
- Sweety's at home
why did you leave her at home?
- As if I could bring them together!
So where's Sweety now?
- I told you, she's at home!
I mean, where's pooja?
- Pooja's making a phone call
Making a phone call?
I get it. I'm done for.
My game is up
How did I get myself into this?
Hey! They don't know each other
Oh yes! Thank God!
Here's what we'll do.
I'll take deepti home
Before I can get there, tell Mambo
to dump Sweety in some other room
Okay... but how?
- How would I know!
Must I explain everything? Tell
the old man to think of a way!
I don't know! Ask him to
do it! He'll find a way out!
Where are they...? Where's deepti?
And where's pooja?
- Look for her!
I'll go and find my curse!
And listen...
don't let her go home.
- Okay
what happened...?
- Sorry!
Deepti!
Open the door!
He's going to get butchered today!
Chhotu, fetch the car!
keep going! Step on it!
Driver, follow that car. Quick!
Pooja! Stop there!
Move it, driver.
- Hey, wait there!
Move it, I say!
- Hey wait...
Okay, pooja. I'm coming.
- C'mon in. Hurry up!
What are you up to?
Terribly insensitive of you
to dump me and go back home!
I saw Mac there. - Pooja,
my heart craves your love...
and you're running after Mac?
A man who ignored you,
despite hearing your voice?
That's because...
- I understand! Oh yes, I do
No one in the world values true love
The one I always see, the
one closest to my heart...
if there is anyone...
it's only you
But that's a song, isn't it?
- Hmmm... no! Is it really a song?
Stop the car. Stop it!
Stay here. I'll be right back.
- But where are you going?
Sam!
- One second!
Mambo, give me a glass of water
where can I find a phone?
- Over there
Mambo, listen carefully. It's me
The Singapore flight
is soon landing there
But fix the Bangkok flight, so
it doesn't wake up before morning!
You understand...? The Bombay
flight is right here with me
Bomb...?! I mean, the
Mumbai flight is here with me
It's about to take off, but I'll
make sure it doesn't get there!
So do just as I say! It's a
question of life and death!
From what he was saying,
he appears to be a terrorist
He's planning something big.
Like hijacking a plane
Let's stop him
till the cops get here
Okay... yes!
Where to, smartass?
- Home
You can't leave,
until the police arrive
police...? - We know everything!
Filthy terrorist!
Mambo, have you ever fallen
in love? - With only my wife
do you have a wife?
- I did, but not anymore
She eloped with my younger brother
But I'm very lucky in this respect.
Sure. You don't
have a younger sister
I'm so lucky, Mac won't
even look at a girl except me
How'd you know how
many roving eyes Mac has?
If you're still listening,
let me tell you...
whatever I'm doing is
not of my own volition
I'm helpless. They're making
me do it. Do you understand?
Since they're paying me,
I'll have to do their bidding
Mac...
- I'm Mambo! Mambo!
Was that a sleeping
pill or an aphrodisiac?
Did you fix the girl?
- Fix?
I only gave her a sedative,
I can do nothing else
The next flight is arriving.
Before it lands,
let's move this one
She's become as heavy as a pumpkin.
- Shut up, jinx
If something happens to her...
I'll end up in jail. Do you want me
to rot in jail at this age?
You...? How did
you arrive before me?
- Used my brains... I mean, body
I didn't want to see your
face red with anger. Come here
Look! I have thrown
all the underwear away
You can sleep in peace now.
- I don't want your sympathy
Not sympathy. You have a right
on me. This is what you call love
Let alone underwear, for your
sake I'll even throw myself out!
You just want love, you are
not willing to return love
don't be so cruel, love. Time
will prove how much I love you
Lies! You can never
understand a woman's feelings
Let alone one, I understand
many women... I've read that book
The Fundamental
principles of woman psychology
Lies! All lies! I know you
are having other affairs too
what are you saying?
This is preposterous
You are being preposterous!
Woman! Stay like a woman, and
behave like one. Not like a whore
See? Your servant is
humiliating me! - One minute
Old swine! How dare you
talk to a woman like that?
I will kick you.
I'll break your jaw
I'm in a bloody mess and you are
raving about women's character
Smartass, I'll thrash you!
Deepti, listen to me. My love...
my darling, listen
to me, open the door
My honey, my baby, my sweetheart...
Bye. I'm leaving
where to? I'm your boss, I pay you
You can't leave
without a month's notice
Notice? I serve you notice
everyday, but you take no notice
You think you can swear
at me at will? Can you?
I'm leaving!
- Listen to me, you can't...
I don't want to listen.
I have taken enough
I'm leaving.
- You can't leave
pooja, I was just
thinking about you.
Where you are, how you are!
And here you are! Looks
like it's my day. Ask him
You don't need to worry about me.
- Why?
I need to talk to you, it's urgent.
- Urgent, my foot!
I want to talk to you in private
It's special
what happened?
- I won't speak much. We're parting
don't even joke about it.
It'll break my heart
You don't have a heart.
We can't carry it further
This relationship has no future.
- Pooja, what are you talking?
I always believed
you will be my wife.
- I hadn't met Shyam before, you see
Hang on. How did you and Shyam...?
He is not like you.
He doesn't wear a mask
If we part, fine. But
don't get close to him
You don't know how cunning
and slimy he is. I'll tell you
I'll expose him. You
mustn't trust anyone so soon
Spending time with me doesn't prove
that your love for me is true
pooja, listen to me. I...
Mac, no need to be angry.
It's all over between us
Forget me. I'm leaving
pooja, we are made for
each other. Listen to me...
pooja, don't do this
Hope all's well?
- No. But it will be
It's a beautiful paradise. I
can't see it turning into hell
where's he going?
- I'll tell you. Wait, I'll tell you
Listen, Shyam...
I planted a sapling...
- when?
Long time back,
before you even arrived
I watered it, provided manure,
saved it from insects...
it grew big, bigger, huge
Then it gave flowers and fruits
One day, a swine plucked a
fruit and began eating it
Now you tell me, what must I do?
Why don't you just thrash the
swine? - Trust me, you are right!
Where friends meet, there's party
Swine! May you rot.
- Hi!
Sorry, I left you
alone and came here
Never mind.
- I'll have some water
where are you going?
- Don't you talk to me!
I'm sorry, I blew up at you.
Please forgive me
I need to apologise, love.
Why must you?
Go and take some rest.
Take care of your skin
Swine! You made my life miserable
what's going on?
What's going on here?
- Nothing. I'm giving him a massage
This is a special massage.
Stretch your hands
Get up, Sam
I need to talk to you,
it's about our future
I'll be back, darling. Okay?
Want to hit me more? Go ahead
Mambo quit. If you say,
I'll leave too
But if I leave, it'll be
difficult for you to manage this game
Think it over
All right. From now on,
pooja is yours
deepti and Sweety are mine.
- Okay
we won't interfere. Promise?
- Okay
And listen... when the girls
leave for work in the morning...
we'll sit and design the
future plans of this game
Okay.
- Done? Good night
where are you going? Pooja is there
Hurry up, deepti. It's
time for your flight
Sam darling, hurry up.
It's time to leave...
Tone it down! You'll wake everyone
Everyone? We are
only three of us here.
- I mean... the neighbours
They already have
complaints against me. Speak softly
All right. Mac, I'm
sorry about yesterday
I spoke too much.
I said that because
I realised you are
a first rate fraud
Forgive me.
- I forgave you last night itself
I forgive women on the spot
You look great in this dress.
- Thank you
No time to romance. Leave,
it's time for her flight
Okay. Let's go.
- Bye
who is this?
- Who? Who is who?
She...? She's Sam's fiancee
Let's go, deepti.
- Hang on, Mac
You should also
introduce her, don't you think?
Don't you know each other?
She is deepti
c'mon, you are late. - No. The
introduction is not over yet
Tell me, how did this girl
land here? - She took a cab
what has she to do with this house?
- What has she to
do with this house!
Deepti is an airhostess,
and Sam's fiancee
pooja is also an airhostess
Amazing! Both are airhostesses.
Same uniform too
what a coincidence! Let's go
One minute! What were
you doing in this bedroom?
Tell her.
- I was putting on my uniform
putting on her uniform. She
is an airhostess, after all
She's not a banker
deepti, time for your flight. Move
Sam! Do you know her?
Why is she here? Please tell me
One minute. You never
told me you had a fiancee
Actually, we met just last night
we fell in love just last
night and we decided to marry
where did you meet her?
- Bella Vista, floor no. 13...
It's this house!
- That's right
How is Mac related to her?
- Mac...?
Did you hear her? She's
asking about our relationship
we'll go mad, let's go
I want an answer! You haven't given
a proper introduction of this girl
He is my fiance
when did he get engaged to you?
- Been a long time
This fiance of yours was
my fiance until yesterday
That's right. She
was my ex-girlfriend
But I was your boyfriend.
- One and the same thing
I'm not denying it.
One and the same.
But now she is his girlfriend
But I met Sam just yesterday.
- She's right
And we fell in love!
- Hear that? You trust me now?
All right, now I understand.
The two of you are hand in glove
Stop raving. If you want,
you can marry him
On the contrary, you
betrayed me. But I forgave you...
because you belong to a
decent family. Don't forget that
Shut up! You have
been playing games...
...with the two of us all this while
It's history! Let bygones be bygones
The two of you have opened our eyes,
put us on the right track, that's it
Sam, from now on pooja
belongs to you and deepti is mine
No other girl will
come into our lives again
It's a sin even to
think about it, remember
put your hand forward... do it!
Give him your hand, pooja
don't think much, give him
your hand before you miss your bus
Right
That's like it. We'll stay
together from now. Fine?
We won't ever cheat.
We'll always stay together
Mac darling, who are these girls?
Run!
Run! Start the motorcycle
quick!
Swine, start it!
Giving you a motorcycle is
like feeding nuts to a dog
Start it!
- You start it
Brother Mac!
What happened?
- You are ruined!
How do you know that?
- Nageshwar...
The white spot?
- Yes. Anjali greased his palm...
and he told her
everything about your setups
May he be ruined! He's nailed me
I have lost her, and the others
too. - The other girls too? How?
Wait here, they will be coming
with brooms, knives and missiles
Ask them, and they will tell you
where do I go? Where do
I kill myself? - Listen!
Before Anjali leaves for India,
go and apologise to her
Else, you'll lose her forever. Go!
I'll drive!
- Easy with the door
Get inside
Shyam, I'm off! Get the
motorcycle over tomorrow, swine!
Uncle, where's Anjali?
She left. And why not? She has
found out everything about you
You were her greatest mistake
You can't belong to one girl
For you, women are playthings!
And Anjali is not a plaything
Go away. And keep the
game of musical chair on
Go on, forget her. Go
what time is her flight?
- 6:30
Thank you
No, I'm not going!
- I just want to see the time
Time, all right.
- 6:00!
One minute. Air India flight?
- Took off
when?
- Half-hour back
Now stop this game of romance,
I've had enough!
I don't have the strength,
I can't take it anymore!
Anjali...
- No need to say anything
I have told her everything,
and she has forgiven you
This ring is the root cause
of all misery. Take it off
And put it on my
sister-in-law's finger. For good
All's well that end's well!
From now on, focus only on family
Run!
Run!
Give me the car key, Babban!
THE END
