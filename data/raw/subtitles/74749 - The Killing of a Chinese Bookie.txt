Let's get our asses downstairs.
We got people.
So, let's go. What's the problem?
Where's Rachel?
[Margo ]
Yeah, is Rachelsick?
[ Cosmo ] Yeah, she's not feeling too good.
She has the flu.

J ust I i ke you guys.
What is this depression?
- Huh?
- [ Teddy] There's a problem -
- Come on. I know there's a problem.
- There's just a misunderstanding, Cosmo.
- What is it?
- [Teddy] The problem that -
It's not a misunderstanding.
It's a problem,
and it has to be discussed now.
Look, I don't want to pull a big star bit...
but people do come here because I'm...
wel l, some unique ki nd of personality,
I suppose.
A bit far out, a bit freakish maybe, but -
- Far out. Okay.
- Not a freak at all.
- Yeah, but freakish.
- Straitlaced.
But - Freakish.
But unique in my own way.
And when things go badly...
who gets the booing?
- I do. But when things go well...
- [Cosmo ] Mymusic director-
they - they, they, they get the applause
and all the cheers...
because they flash their tits.
- [Woman ] Hey, no way!
- [Woman #2 ] Bullshit!
Let us be civil, ladies.
Now, Teddy. Teddy.
- [ Teddy Mutters ]
- Everything takes work.
We'll straighten it out. You know.
You gotta work hard to be comfortable.
Yeah, a lot of people
kid themselves, you know.
They -They know when theywere born,
they know where they're goin'...
they know whether they're gonna go to heaven,
whether they're gonna go to hell.
They think they know that.
They kid themselves.
Right?
But the only people...
who are, you know, happy...
are the people who are comfortable.
That's right.
Now, you take, uh, uh, Carol, right?
- [Laughing]

[Woman ]
Aw, no.
[ Cosmo ]
A dingbat, right? A ding-a-ling.
A dingo.
That's what people think she is,
'cause that's the truth theywant to believe.
But, uh, you put her
in another situation, right?
Put her in a situation that's tough.
Stress. Where she's up against something,
you'll see she's no fool.
- Right?
- [Woman ]A littlesilly, but no fool.
Right. 'Cause what's your truth...
is my falsehood.
What's my falsehood is your truth
and vice versa.
- [Woman ] Doyou have a Kleenex?
- Right?
But let's let that go.
That's too confusing.
I confused myself.
Now, let me see.
Where was I?
Oh, yeah.
Well, look. Look at me, right?
I'm only happywhen I'm angry...
when I'm sad,
when I can play the fool...
when I can be what people want me to be
rather than be myself.
- You understand?
- [ Teddy] Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
And that takes work.
Gotta work overtime for that.
Yeah. Doesn't matterwhoyou are
orwhat personalityyou choose.
- [ Woman ] Come on, baby. Silly boy.
- "Come on, baby." Choose a personality.
- Get dressed.
- Let's go down there and -
- I'll giveyou a rubdown after the show.
- Right.
- We'll do a great show...
- [Woman ] Watch out.
we'll smile, we'll cry...
big, glistening tears
that pour onto the stage...
and we'll make their lives
a little happier, huh?
So theywon't have to face themselves.
They can pretend to be somebody else.
Be happy. Be joyous.
Come on. You. Maestro.
