Once in a while,
although not very often, -
- you find a place where
the menu is irrelevant.
Where you don't come merely to eat,
but just to be there.
Just to sit in a quiet corner
watching the staff radiating...
... a rare sense of satisfaction.
And to watch them work.
And suddenly you realize
that here, and only here, -
- is where they've always belonged.
Incredible that grown men,
cannot decide to meet?
He's from Poland.
- So fuckin' what? He should be here now!
Don't be too hard on the guy.
Why are you so late?
- I don't understand...
What's he saying, Peter?
- It sounded like "diarrhea."
Yeah, goulash gives drivers diarrhea.
So of course he is late.
I've had diarrhea since I was 16, man.
Cigarettos?
- Yes, yes.
What the fuck's this?
The wrong brand! Now what?
What the hell do we do
with 34,000 cartons of "Look"?
Nobody smokes that
menthol shit. God damn it!
Cigarettos...
Shut the fuck up, man!
- Arne, cool it!
Peter, tell him!
- Take it easy, man...
Torkild!
Cigarettos!
Maybe we can trade them,
or something.
He might not even notice, right.
It's Torkild.
Get me the Faroese.
I know you'll never read it.
- I'll read it.
The Real Life
It looks great...
- I gave it to you before, but you threw it out.
I'll... I'll read it.
Thanks.
Let's go back to your place.
- I've met someone.
What does that mean?
- It's over.
Look, when I've paid back the Faroese...
- You've said that for five years.
That's not true!
Before you came, I was just thinking
about... starting my own business.
Maybe a shoe shop or a pet store.
- You can't even feed a fish.
I can learn that, right.
I can do the hell I want.
No, you can't!
You're 40 years old.
What does he do?
- He works at the paper.
What's his name?
Don't you touch him.
- Just relax.
You're crazy about him?
- Yes, I guess so.
You're going to have kids and stuff?
- Maybe we will.
That's what regular people do.
Have kids, get married, take them to Tivoli.
Bakken is more fun.
Not so many Swedes.
Don't you care?
Good luck with everything.
- Yeah. You, too.
Congratulation, Torkild
A rifle...
- A rifle? This bad boy is an AK-47!
You know it can penetrate iron?
This baby can penetrate suburbs.
It's the baddest weapon
you can imagine, man.
Give it to me, I'll show you.
What took you so long?
- My mom called.
We're opening the presents...
- What did you give him?
You remember that guy that
shot at the White House?
No.
A psychopath let off 20 shots at it.
- Never heard about it.
Fuck that, he used an AK-47.
- Hanne chipped in, too.
Fucking not!
- No it isn't, Stefan!
It's very nice. What is it, a paintball gun?
- What did she say?
A paintball gun... It looks very real.
- Of course it's not real.
So... you're Hanne?
Stefan talks about you all the time.
We have met before?
- You remember Hanne, right.
I was just...
Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Don't worry, I always forget her, too.
What's up, Torkild... are you happy or what?
Sure I am, it's... crazy...
I just need to...
Goddamn, Peter.
- You want some?
I could have shot you.
It's okay. No harm done.
Celebrating without me?
Why the hell didn't we invite the Faroese?
You got your period, or what?
No, I was just coming...
Happy birthday, goddammit.
Thanks.
- Yeah, yeah.
You got my money?
No.
Now you're mine, Torkild.
Yeah, yeah...
You'll pick up a suitcase for me tonight.
- Okay, where?
It's in a Greek diplomat's house.
In his moneybox.
His...?
- His safe.
Exactly. William will fill you in.
Don't open the suitcase.
Can't I do one big job?
So I can pay you off once and for all?
I'll do anything, just something new.
God dammit, I almost shot Peter...
You're mine, Torkild.
Get the suitcase tonight, understand?
Yeah...
Yeah, yeah.
Shut up Arne, goddammit!
Wow, what a mirror!
Great craftsmanship.
Concentrate!
- We could take it with us, it's damn nice...
We're not dragging
a giant mirror around, bozo.
I've always wanted one of these.
You know what these things cost?
Well bring it along.
Shut up. Look at this beautiful stuff!
- Yeah...
Where's Stefan?
What's that?
Stuffed peppers. You want some?
- That's fuckin' disgusting.
There's some cold tzatziki, too.
You mind giving a hand?
- Take it easy.
Holy shit...
That's a real lot of dough, Torkild.
Torkild, I'm hit, I'm hit.
Torkild, goddammit!
Take him to the car.
How come people have to keep
on talking when they're dying?
I'll smack you, if you don't shut up.
- I have to keep awake, I'm fuckin' bleeding!
It's a flesh wound!
I bleed more when I jerk off.
Fat pig! You're bleeding
on the money, jerk!
Don't bleed on the money, Peter!
- I'm cold, okay?
That's because you've
been shot. Crybaby.
What do we do now?
Where are we going?
Torkild?
I want out.
- What?
I want out.
Torkild, help us out here.
- What do you want out of, Torkild?
I'm 40. I can't even have a birthday
party without shooting at people.
I get an AK-44 for a present.
- 47.
I should get a golf bag.
I should have a house in Skodsborg.
Skodsborg?
- We can go there if you want, Torkild.
No! I don't want to go to Skodsborg.
- Then what do you want?
How much cash do you think there is?
- Three or four million?
But it's not yours.
The Faroese would kill us.
I'll never get that much money again.
- That's right! Where shall we go?
What about Barcelona?
Where Coke Henry got the clap?
Fine, let's go to Barcelona.
I don't care.
As long as we keep a low profile.
- What's going on?
For how long?
- Until I know what I want.
We can't.
I can't.
Hanne's making brunch.
You'll get 100,000 each if you come.
Look at me, Torkild. I need medical care, now!
- Shut it. It went straight through you.
You'll be fine in a couple of days.
Let's try out Torkild's idea.
I should have left a note
for Hanne, she'll get angry...
Shut up, Stefan.
She'd would never allow you to leave.
Women don't know
how to say goodbye.
They don't like endings. That's why
they watch soaps as "Dollars" and "Dynasty".
They never end.
I saw all of "Matador".
- That's only 12 episodes.
No, there were at least 20 of them.
- In "Matador"?
Yeah, the one with Misse Moehge?
- There's only 12 episodes.
There are 24 in Matador.
I watched them.
You guys seen it?
- I should have left a note.
I taped it. I never saw it.
- Weren't there 24 episodes?
I don't quite remember.
But there really was.
No, we're definitely here.
Arne, concentrate, will you?
There's a hell of a lot of trees here.
- Can't we take a real road?
Yeah, this one. The border's here.
- Yeah. Take a right next time.
I don't fucking believe this!
Where are your brains, Arne?
I said a getaway car!
And you find this...
- Shitty short bus.
Yes, a shitty short bus!
- You wanted something low-key.
And what do you call this?
No thanks! Get your shit
and let's get out of here.
Why are we stopping here?
We can spend the night here. Come.
It must be an old inn or something.
- Or a stable!
Wow, this is really the country.
- It's disgusting. Bird shit and piss everywhere.
It's okay for a night.
- Exactly.
What did I tell you, Torkild?
It'll bear fruit this year.
Now you see
why we bought this place.
There's only three.
- So what?
Some apple trees have lots,
and some have few.
And ours has three.
- Mine.
It's my apple tree!
They're my apples.
Can't we get a bigger place soon?
- Are you nuts? We can't move now.
And why should we?
- I want my own room.
Stop it, Torkild!
Did you eat one of Dad's apples?
Your father can't handle it, Torkild.
For 18 years he's been
going on about that apple tree.
I want my own room.
- Shut up!
Dad's tree is bearing fruit this year.
We've waited so long, understand, Torkild?
Promise me you'll leave
the last two alone.
Then can I get my own room?
- Just promise me that.
I promise I'll leave the
last two apples hang.
Paul. You hear that, Paul?
What's that?
- An apple.
It was an apple.
How could you do this to us?
Why, Torkild?
Don't you care about your family?
Torkild, can't you understand there
are things you don't do to people?
Everyone needs something
that's just theirs.
So promise me you'll let the last
apple be, no touching or eating...
Come here, you! What the hell are you
trying to do? Are you crazy or what?
Your father can't stop crying.
You go apologize to him right now!
Paul...
Torkild!
Peter's sick.
Leave me be, goddammit!
- Come.
Come on, get up.
- Leave me alone, Arne.
Stop it, Arne!
- Arne, put him down.
Torkild, I feel strange.
Can you move?
- Think I'd be lying here if I could?
I need water, and a doctor.
- Aha, and also a cheeseburger or what?
Stefan, check if there's a doctor outside.
- Shut up, Arne and get some water.
Water? We have to get going.
- Get some water!
I feel weird, weird...
Is it bad?
It doesn't look too good.
- Torkild!
Someone's coming.
Who's that clown?
- Who is it?
It's empty, you jerk.
- Who the fuck is it?
It's a... hunter.
- Stay here.
I once fired such a gun.
Howdy!
- How... dy.
I hope you got it cheap?
- Cheap?
That pile of shit's
been empty for 20 years.
We were scared they'd make
it into a refugee camp.
We can't have a flock of baboons
running around here and shit the forest.
No, of course not.
- You're not from the Red Cross?
No, no. Don't worry.
We just bought the place.
You guys opening a restaurant?
- Yeah, that's right.
Not a pizza joint, I hope?
- No, just a... nice family restaurant.
We used to eat here, my dad and I.
We liked it.
- Yeah... it's a nice place.
We really liked it!
Well, you'd better put
those two craftsmen to work.
Those two look like lazy bums.
Keep after them!
See you around.
- Hey, you know where to find a doctor?
One of the guys, is feeling bad.
He's just trying to get off work,
that lazy pig.
No, he's really sick.
We need a doctor.
Carl?
- That's me.
He's inside.
How did this happen?
- It was a hunting accident.
I've seen many hunting
accidents, in my life.
But this isn't one of them.
I'll pay you to fix him up.
- No, no, I can't...
I've got plenty of money...
if this stays between us.
That kind of thing is expensive.
There.
Okay.
He's got to lie still for two weeks.
- Two weeks?
But he can't.
He's got to ride with us.
No! Any movement could kill him.
The wound could open.
He has to lie still,
drink plenty of fluids, and eat salt.
We don't have any salt.
- I'll give you a ride into town.
That's your treatment?
- Yup.
You're not going to do anything else?
- Nope.
I'll go with him.
Torkild... that guy's a psycho.
Want me to go along?
No, stay here.
You're losing some of that.
- Thanks.
I don't know who you are,
or why you shot him.
If you want to run a business here,
you have to stop shooting each other.
We don't do that around here.
- No.
What's taking him so long?
It's not like Torkild.
Shut the fuck up.
He took all the money?
- Shut you pie hole and sniff your shit.
I did. It's all gone now.
Here he comes.
Howdy.
- "Howdy"?
What's that?
- A van.
You bought a van?
- Yeah. It fits our alibi.
Our what?
- Come on, give me a hand.
What the hell's that?
- What are you doing, Torkild?
What's all this junk?
- It's not junk, it's culture.
Why should Arne be the only one
of us to see "Matador"?
It's a cultural treasure in 24 episodes,
and only Arne has seen it.
I've bought for 8500 kr. worth of culture.
There's Karen Blixen, and
Hans Christian Andersen and a lot...
Fuck H.C. Andersen, man!
- No, Arne. We can't.
And there'll be no more "Fuck" or
"Shut the fuck up". Say "Darn" in stead.
We'll be here two weeks, so we have
to fit in and use our time properly.
What the fuck... what about Barcelona?
- You heard Carl.
He was hammered!
He wasn't...
- Shut the fuck up!
You want to take the
back road to Barcelona?
Knock it off, you idiot!
Fuck you, man.
- No more cursing.
Don't you see?
It's a genius chance for us.
Those rednecks think
we're opening a restaurant.
We just need to do a little work
on it, and they'll leave us alone.
You're my crew.
I'm not your fucking handyman.
- It's just until Peter gets well.
Then we go to Barcelona.
Come on, help me.
They're gone.
What do you mean?
- They vanished.
No one's seen them since Wednesday,
and the Greeks suitcase is also gone.
God damn, Torkild!
What do we do then?
- We wait.
They'll make a mistake.
And then we knock.
We strike.
- That, too.
Go. You're disturbing my fish.
Did you know, when they made
cannons in the old days, -
- the gunsmith had to sit on it
the first time it was fired.
Why's that?
There were so many bad cannons.
They blew up when you fired them.
So the angry king said the gunsmiths had
to sit on them for the first shot.
Arne, god dammit, we've had
frozen pizzas for five days now.
Who fixed the oven? Me.
You can fix your own oven.
Just shut the fuck up.
There's all kinds of
vegetable shit on this.
It was a good idea.
- To sit on a cannon?
I mean, being responsible.
- I won't eat this shit anymore!
How many guns have you sold?
- I don't know.
What if one of them
gets you shot one day?
What do you think?
I'd take the guy out bowling.
But who's responsible?
- I did 16 months, didn't I?
Who cares if he sold bazookas
to a paroled Greenlander?
I need food, I need a bath!
I stink of mould covered ass! I need some coke!
You can't have any.
- I've got to!
I've got to have something
for my nose, or I'll go crazy.
Torkild! Look at me.
Look at me, Torkild!
You've got to help me.
I can't, Peter.
Arne...
Yeah?
- It's Peter.
Peter who?
- Peter... you know.
Henry, I need a few bags.
- Peter, god dammit... Where are you?
Henry, I need a lot.
- Okay, but where are you?
I don't know...
Fredericia.
We could meet at the docks.
I need it now.
- You'll get it Wednesday.
Okay, Fredericia docks. Damn!
What the hell are you doing, Peter?
Are you trying to get us all killed?
Yeah, I warned you, Torkild.
Arne!
I told you!
- Arne...
What's going on here?
He stays in there.
- He'll suffocate.
No, he won't.
He was calling Coke Henry.
So why can't I call Hanne?
- I stopped him in time.
Cool it, now.
- Come out, I'll kill you!
He promises not to do it again.
Doesn't matter. He broke the rules,
he must be punished.
Let's go outside.
- Shut up.
He'll kill us. He can't stand smoke.
- He won't find out shit.
It's actually my granddad's fault.
He caught my dad smoking and put
him in a closet with 50 smokes.
He had to smoke them all.
He's completely crazy.
What...?
In you go, Peter.
Okay. You can come out
when you've smoked them all.
No, Peter's busy.
No, I don't know when
he'll have time again.
Have you smoked them?
No.
- Then enjoy your stay there.
Happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday, dear Peter
happy birthday to you...
Here.
- Thanks.
Happy birthday.
Come and join the guests.
Nice gravy.
Call an ambulance!
Come out, Peter, hurry!
Your father's had a stroke.
Hurry up, now.
- Is he dead?
No, no. But hurry!
Let me out!
- Torkild, god dammit, he needs methadone.
No! We don't use that around here.
Okay... If they don't use that here,
we'll do things the proper way.
Give him food, water and salt.
And... also this.
You sure about that?
- Are you a doctor?
No...
- Then do as I say.
He's plastered, Torkild.
- Arne...
You are! You shouldn't
be driving. It's also illegal.
That's a very, very serious accusation!
That's enough, Arne.
Don't mind him...
We ought to lock him up, man.
- Barcelona, Stefan...
Arne!
Let me out, Arne!
I've need to get to Fredericia.
Arne, let me out!
They're not here.
- I told you so.
They're screwing you around, Dagur.
Let's go...
We stay. We paid to cross the
fucking bridge, so now we stay.
They're fucking with you.
They could be anywhere now.
Don't trust Coke Henry.
I can feel they're here.
- What can you feel...?
Fuck, man!
I always wanted to see Jutland.
Peter...
I want to get out.
- You will.
Can I? I'll behave, I just want out.
Can you walk?
- Just let me out. I'll be good.
Peter, what the hell are you doing?
What do you want?
I want to get out.
- Shut your pie hole, you are out, man.
Further out.
- Peter?
How are you feeling?
Howdy, Torkild, can I get further out?
- Of course you can.
You don't want to shower first?
- No, I just want to get out.
Hey, where the fuck you going?
- Out.
Can't you slow down a bit?
Fuck, you stink, dude!
Can't you smell it?
You okay, Peter?
Can we drive away then?
Torkild! Peter's okay.
Let's get out of here.
Sure, but slow down...
- Don't tell me, tell the douchebag.
Peter, for chrissakes!
Wow!
It's beautiful.
You're standing on a condom, Torkild.
There's a little gravy left...
Look at kid brother here!
He ain't grown up yet.
Peter, god dammit!
Shit, what an idiot!
He will get sick now.
That water's not cold.
It's fucking cold, man!
Torkild, you're a chicken, man!
We're going to Barcelona!
Peter?
Peter, we have to go.
- I need too sleep an hour more.
Hey. What the fuck's happened here?
Where's the money, Torkild?
- Aren't we leaving?
I bought the shithole.
1.7 million. It was a bargain.
Giant ground is included and shit.
Why are you doing this?
I don't want to go to Barcelona.
I want a place of my own.
All I want is right here.
The woods, the beach... you guys.
Don't you see?
We'll do it, god dammit.
Do what, Torkild?
- Open a restaurant.
No, we're going to Barcelona.
We can't even fry an egg!
We can learn.
- One and half million, and no roof?
I'm going to Barcelona, okay?
- Well, I'm staying here.
I hope you will too. You'll get paid.
- I want 28,500 kr. a month, like Hanne.
No problem.
- Stop this right now.
Are we going or what?
- No, we're staying.
Okay, fair enough...
See? Peter wants to stay.
Arne, look!
Hi there...
You got him!
- What the hell are you doing, man?
You can't just shoot nature!
Are you completely mad?
It was just a squirrel...
I don't give a fuck! You can't
keep doing this. Give me that.
It was a squirrel, man!
- So fuckin' what?
No more shooting.
They don't do that here.
What if the Faroese comes?
- Stop shooting, then he won't.
How about "The Golden Rooster"?
- Nah... sounds like a pub.
I preferred "Old Traveler Inn."
- That's too swanky.
We need something catchy.
Something memorable.
Hey, Stefan?
What is it, Stefan?
- Something wrong?
It's just so... beautiful.
Listen here:
In the long night where memory strays
lights from the past flicker on,
distant signals from childhood days
to a fearful heart on the run...
There's more...
someone who wants to share your nights
and your days will never get far,
your life lies behind in the flickering lights
and no-one will know who you are.
Must be something missing.
What's it called again?
"Flickering Lights"...
by Ove Ditlevsen.
The mice have been at
Ove Ditlevsen's book.
It's all right, nothing's missing.
Good book.
Actually Ove Ditlevsen is
one of our greatest poets.
It's good that Stefan's reading.
- But what does it mean?
Who fuckin' cares, man!
Stefan, are you crying over a poem?
- No.
It's a metaphor.
- What kind of crap word is that, man?
Are we literary critics now?
- Arne, cool it.
Shut it, dude! Your brain hasn't worked
since you got out of the freezer.
What the fuck is happening to us...?!
Stefan! Are you crying over a poem?
- No...
No...
Jesus, is this a sauna club or what?
Bunch of faggots.
- I'm sorry.
No, no, I liked that... "Flickering Lights."
- So did I. It sounds real good.
Yeah, so let's call the place that.
How much does all this crap cost?
- Don't worry about it.
Stefan, help us.
- There's no handles, god dammit.
I'd like to know how much money is left.
- Relax, there's plenty.
Why can't Peter help?
- Just leave them alone.
Now we've got a real refrigerator.
- Never mind that.
Beers should be cooled in the ground.
That's just how it is.
It's a question of finding
the right depth.
If it's too shallow,
the frost gets them.
You want a hand?
- No, no. Just wait, my boy.
You'll be digging plenty of holes.
It can take years to
find your personal depth.
How do you know
when you've found it?
You can taste it.
One day, you'll take
one out and taste it, -
- and it's as if the heavens
open up for you.
All your sorrows are gone.
You're at peace with yourself.
You're in a state of joy!
Earth-cooled joy.
Howdy!
How's the work going?
A little housewarming present.
My dad shot it,
on the other side of the lake.
We're busy, Alfred.
- Oh? Sorry, then...
Then I won't be bothering you.
Very sorry about that...
See you later, Alfred.
Yes. Well...
Say hi to Torkild.
Bye, Alfred.
He's a bit retarded.
Now. Dig your own hole!
You call that a sauce?
- What the fuck else?
I could think of many things,
but not "sauce." Start again.
You can't be serious.
- You should care for it like a human being.
It needs constant attention
and massive amounts of love.
This sauce hasn't had that.
It's merely a fetus.
You calling my sauce a fetus?
It's sloppy.
It needs wisdom and care.
Make a new one, and give it what
it deserves. And a lot more wine.
It's only a sauce, man!
I can't take this much longer, Torkild.
You have to learn, Arne.
- I'm finished.
Good, Peter.
Now clean up.
While we're waiting for the sauce.
Where did you learn to cook, anyway?
I thought you were a doctor?
I was married to a woman for 17 years,
who couldn't cook.
I cooked food for my wife
and kids for 17 years.
I think I know how to cook!
- Take it easy, man.
We can stop for now, Carl.
- No, it's good to be cooking again.
When you're alone, you don't bother.
How did she die?
- A drunk driver.
A station wagon. Completely
irresponsible at Christmas time.
They went to pick up my mother
at the train station, and... bang!
Henrik, my eldest son,
died on New Year's day.
Did you get the driver?
- He died, too. They all died.
But you still can't teach me
how to make a sauce!
Right, little Arne?
- I'm taking my fuckin' break now!
You're useless, Arne!
Hi...
Eh... Is Stefan here?
Stefan...
Stefan!
Hanne...
- Hi.
Are you here?
- It's a great place you found here.
How did you find us?
- What do you mean?
Didn't you tell them I was coming?
- I didn't know.
I told you.
- Stefan, did you call her?
For chrissakes, man...
- God dammit, Stefan, man.
I told you not to come, right.
- Take it easy!
Bet she brought the Faroese along.
- Your stupid friends can stay away from us.
Especially now, with the baby coming.
Holy shit...
- What about the soup?
Come on, Arne...
- What is coming?
I couldn't tell you on the phone.
You're going to be a dad, Stefan.
We're going to be a little family!
Yes...
Aren't you happy?
Sure...
You fucking bet.
Yep...
Those two are going to
smash up the whole place.
I just painted that ceiling, Torkild!
- Ssh. Just watch the film, okay.
Oh, so she bought one too?
Yeah, he gets one, too.
For being kind.
He turns into a faggot later on.
- Don't tell us!
Can you really do that
when you're pregnant?
Won't the kid get fucked,
right on the head?
Torkild, what does a
horse like that cost?
That's enough, you two!
Good morning.
We're going for a walk on the beach.
Good idea. We'll take a break now.
You don't have to come.
- We were going that way anyway.
We'll walk on ahead a bit.
You can catch us up, if you want.
I'll kill that little hooker!
Hey, language!
- Shut the fuck up, man.
Look, we've got customers.
- We're not ready.
- Yes we are.
They're our first customers!
Put on a clean shirt.
But who's going to cook?
- Arne, of course. Get going!
Howdy!
- Hi.
A table for two?
Open the register!
Give us the money or...
I'll beat you up!
Arne, if we keep calm,
it'll be all right.
Relax, it's a robbery.
- What the fuck, is going on here?
You got more of them...?
Give me that.
Give it here!
Pick them up.
- What?
They're not loaded.
- Don't say that, okay!
Here, take this...
And get the hell out of here.
Jesus, Arne!
Stop it!
Let go of that fucking glass!
Take him and get out,
for chrissakes! Disappear!
You stop this right now, Torkild!
- Arne, take it easy.
Shut the fuck up, man!
What the hell's going on?
The dimwits just ran off with all our change.
Enough of this fucking piss!
That "fuck" will cost you 50 kr. Arne.
Fuck you!
100 kr.
I like "Torvald", too.
- So what's wrong with "Torkild"?
It's nearly the same.
- No, it's not!
My granddad's name was Torvald,
not Torkild.
No child of mine is gonna be
called Torkild, I tell you...
Someone's going to break a leg in this.
What happening?
- Arne's gone.
What happened?
- Some mess, huh?
Whose blood is that?
- Just some customers'.
Is Arne all right?
- Yeah.
How was the beach?
- Customers? Are you all crazy?
They're psychos, Stefan.
- Here, give a hand.
What?
Take it easy, nothing happened.
What are you looking at, man?
Are you deaf or what?
I said, what are you looking at?
You like staring?
You're so fucking ugly.
Big, fat cow.
Shitty cow.
What the hell are you doing, man?
What the fuck, are you shooting my cows?
- Sorry, I didn't know it was yours.
You'll pay for that cow!
What did you shoot it with?
- It's a Desert Eagle.
Israeli Army.
Just take it.
She's... a heavy mother, ain't she?
- Biggest handgun ever made.
It's yours. For the cow, right.
That's a nice shotgun, too.
- It's a Georg Christensen.
It was my dad's.
Want to hold it?
Can I?
Take a look at this.
Arne, Jesus fuckin' Christ!
What the hell are you doing?
- We're hunting.
Get lost. I don't
need your piss anymore.
He just needs to get it out
of his system. Let him be, okay.
I'll send him home afterwards.
Don't worry, Torkild.
A buck, Alfred!
- See you later.
Okay place, you have here.
- It saves going home.
Sometimes I stay here, so I'm ready
to shoot ducks when the sun comes up.
The ducks come in the morning?
- Yeah, early morning, late afternoon.
But you have to be alert,
'cause they're fast little fuckers.
My dad, he could shoot ducks.
Eight or ten at a time.
He must have been bloody good.
If so much as a snail moved,
we'd blow it away, I tell ya.
But then he went off to Thailand and
brought one of those brown hookers home.
For 13 years, we didn't even
shoot a pheasant, because of her.
She was vegetarian and
Buddhist and all that crap.
So he was sold on all that.
When he died she went back home,
and I went back to the woods again.
But like Carl always says...
it's more fun when you're "two".
Yeah, Carl's always right.
- Don't feel sorry for Carl.
Believe me, I fuckin' don't.
- You know he's a liar?
How's that?
- All his retarded stories are lies.
The bitch left him so fast,
that mud squirted high up her back.
They took his kids,
'cause he beat them down.
He hit them?
- You bet he did!
Well, I beat them a few times too,
so he wouldn't feel so bad.
He should never have them kids.
You have to have a hunting
license, and permission, -
- and all kinds of shit,
just to buy an air gun...
- but other people can shit out,
as many brats as they want.
It should be damn opposite!
What about you guys?
You got families?
No.
You're not really craftsmen, are you?
No. We're just in hiding.
But I'm fed up with it.
Did you kill someone?
- Yeah, that too.
Always wanted to try that.
But I've never really had a reason,
so I've stuck to animals.
Are you leaving?
- I don't know.
Torkild just has to be set straight.
It's always been like that.
You boys go back a long way, huh?
Yeah.
Arne?
Come here.
Where do you think you're going?
- Just over to Lars.
Lars? That four-eyed kid?
Aren't they in Sweden?
No, they let him stay home.
- Come here.
No trouble, okay?
- No. We're just studying.
That's right. If you work hard at
school, you can't go completely wrong.
Off you go.
- Bye, Dad.
Did you get him?
- I think so. Go see.
We'd best be getting back.
You've tried it now.
Shut up, it's your turn now.
- I don't want to.
If you don't do it, I'll punch you!
- I don't want to.
You want more?
- No.
They're only pellets, relax.
Take it easy, dammit,
they're just pellets!
Look, it's nothing.
Shouldn't we go for a walk.
- Lets wait a bit, okay?
Why do we have to stay here?
Arne left, why can you not?
But Arne is coming back.
This is so boring. The first
episodes are much better.
Can't we go down to the beach?
- Then do it on your own!
You can't talk to me like that!
- Idiot.
Did you hear what he said to me?
- Oh, shut up.
There he is.
Howdy!
Hi, Arne.
I shot twelve ducks, Torkild.
Alfred says he's never seen anything like it.
Twelve in one shot!
- That's great, Arne.
Where's your bag?
- I gave it to Alfred.
And he gave you the shotgun?
- Yeah. We swapped.
Well, what the hell.
I suppose one shotgun's okay.
Lots of folks have them.
But don't let the customers see it, okay?
There aren't going to be
any customers, Torkild.
What did you expect?
You can't just open a restaurant
in the middle of the woods,
and expect people bursting in.
Want to see a fox?
- Hi, Arne. Torkild...?
It's just that Hanne...
- We'll go to the beach now.
We're all here, so we can
go down to the beach. Together.
Let's go...
I'll give you the rest of
the money if you drown her.
Now, now. Show some tolerance.
Look how happy Stefan is.
What the hell's going on?
You sound like a bunch of faggots.
Give her a chance.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Look, they're not so bad.
- They're nuts, can't you see?
They're a bunch of psychopaths.
We can't stay here.
They're all right. You just
have to get to know them better.
How? All you do is drink and hunt
and watch television.
Then let's do something else.
What do you want to do?
What is it?
- I feel like blowing eggs.
What?
- I want to blow eggs.
Your turn, Stefan.
Isn't this fun?
- Yeah...
Did you blow eggs, too,
when you were kids?
Yeah, I did.
Every Easter, we used to blow forty
eggs until we were red in the face.
It was real cozy.
Did you guys have animals, too,
when you were kids?
Let's just do the eggs.
Your turn, Torkild.
I don't want to.
- Come on, everyone else did one!
If he doesn't want to, Hanne...
Okay, I'll blow one.
Nothing's happening, Torkild!
You're doing it all wrong, Torkild.
He... what...
Torkild, you're doing it all wrong.
Torkild, you haven't got a clue.
Let him try.
- I've never seen anyone worse at it.
Here, let me show you.
Wait, Stefan.
Torkild, if you just...
Shut the fuck up, bitch!
Just forget it, Torkild. There's
something wrong with that egg.
Stefan, get her out of here.
- Come on, honey...
What happened?
- Yeah...
Look at that, the shell's all wrong.
It wasn't you, Torkild.
Yeah. It must have been a sick hen.
Yeah, the shell looks really weird.
- Sure, just forget about it.
Drive!
Maybe I should say goodbye?
- No. Then we won't get the van.
It's Torkild's van.
- You don't owe him anything.
He owes you money, right?
- Yes, but...
Then drive!
Come on, Stefan!
- Okay.
Dagur...
- I'm playing billiards.
Just listen to this.
Are you guys related or what?
What is this childish crap?
Why won't he come back?
Relax Torkild, sit down and watch this.
- I've seen the crap 20 times!
It's no fun anymore!
How about a card game?
- I'm going to bed.
To bed?
- Alfred's coming tomorrow morning.
You could stay up for a bit. What if
Stefan comes back? Or customers?
Listen, there won't be any customers.
If there are, wake me up. Good night.
What if he doesn't come back?
- Good night, Torkild.
So, Stefan.
Open Granddad's present.
Oh, my!
- Thanks, Granddad.
It's from Grandma, too.
Not that you care.
Eat properly, Stefan!
Small bites.
You also don't care that Grandmas
stomach is full of cancer, right?
No, I'm not.
- How often have you visited her?
Once! One lousy visit
from you, in two weeks.
You'll be sorry when she's gone.
When I went blind, they told me my
other senses would be enhanced.
But I've just had these
damn colds all the time.
Stefan, today you become an adult.
So let me tell you what my father
told me when I was confirmed:
Never forget your family, he said!
Never forget it!
No matter what happens,
never forget your family.
Just look at Susanne and...
- Anders.
Anders. Susanne and Anders.
We all know what you went through
with your little boy.
The Lord took him.
But did you give up? No!
You kept on going,
because you had your family.
Stop that noise!
- What happened?
Nothing.
Was I snoring?
It's okay.
- You get used to it.
Just wait till you meet Uncle Sven,
he nearly choked on his own snot.
I hope they come to the christening.
They're looking forward to seeing you.
- You said that already!
I'm sure they'll like you.
And you have to meet Karsten,
Rolf and Marianne and all the kids.
They've had three kids, all
with water on the brain, imagine!
The essence of all this is...
...no matter what happens,
you've got your family.
And family, if you lean on it, there's
nothing in the world you can't overcome.
Cheers, my boy,
and don't forget that.
Why can't you behave!
- What?
Look at that...
I knew it!
I knew it would happen.
I'm bleeding.
I'm bleeding!
- No...
Not again!
- Relax, lay down...
No, no, don't lie on the carpet!
You can't get blood off.
Mom, I don't want to lose it!
- Come out here on the floor, come.
Yes, come here.
- What the hell's going on?
What the hell's going on?
Evening!
There's a fucking restaurant
here somewhere.
It's in the woods.
- I know, that's what they all say.
We've been looking for it,
for a fucking day and a half.
Watch your mouth, my little friend!
Let me go.
- Show me where the fuckin' place is!
It's there.
Thank you!
Hi.
Any customers?
- Sure, they all went for a piss.
What about Carl?
- Not yet.
I think we should go.
- What?
Yeah, we could drive south.
It's empty, Torkild.
And you owe us a lot of dough.
We'll rob a couple of gas stations
on the way to Barcelona.
You can get some coke, Peter.
And you can get guns, Arne.
Hold it, Torkild...
No can do.
I'm going hunting tomorrow.
Get over there!
Take their guns.
Why the fuck, Torkild, did you do this?
They're clean.
Have you guys hung up your guns?
It's a trick. You know,
I won't shoot unarmed men.
But it won't work.
Here you are...
Now it's a fair fight.
Stay where you are.
Howdy.
Stefan?
- Hi, Torkild. Arne... Peter.
But why?
- It didn't work out.
What about Hanne?
Well...
She cried a bit.
And then...
she yelled a bit.
Sorry about this, boys.
That's all right, Torkild.
- Shut up!
What is it with you guys?
Are you faggots or what?
Why am I always left out?
You think you're better than me?
What?
Give me the money,
so you can die fuckin' quickly.
It's all gone.
- Don't lie! Where is it?
It's true, it's gone.
We bought this restaurant.
- A restaurant?
But why, Torkild?
Because I wanted my own place.
It's him!
Alfred, for chrissakes, they're dead!
Take it easy, Alfred.
It's...
It's over.
Easy, now...
So that was three roast pork
and one stewed cabbage?
It was actually at this table,
he ended his days.
Weren't you scared?
- Yes. It was frightening.
And he was from Greenland, you say?
- Carl thought he was.
But he was actually a Faroese.
He was a big crook from Faroe Islands.
Who's Carl?
Carl, is the guy sitting
at the bar, with Alfred.
The Faroese met his match in those two.
Can I show you, to your table?
Just sit down,
I'll be there in a moment.
Thank you.
Two more, please.
And one for me, too.
- In just a moment.
Hi, Torkild.
- Hi.
Eh... This is Flemming.
Hi, hi.
Hello.
- Hello.
Is this the... him?
- It's him.
So this is your place?
- Yes, it is.
Would you like to sit down?
- Yes, that would be nice.
Anything you like. On the house.
- You don't need to do that.
Yes I do.
- The paper's paying.
But don't give us anything special.
- Yes, yes, of course.
Fuck, this looks disgusting...
- No, just look...
You know who's in there?
Yeah, we've seen her, she looks a lot
nicer now, than when you screwed her.
No, she doesn't.
She does, Torkild.
- She's blossomed.
He must be well-hung.
- Shut up. Peter, get our best wine.
It's gone.
- It can't be. Check your holes?
There's only beer.
Please, help me.
Just do this for me, and
I'll never ask for another favor.
We can't make gourmet food, Torkild.
- It doesn't matter, just do your best!
That's all that matters, right?
Torkild, you shouldn't have.
- Today's menu. Same for everyone.
The last seven years, I've visited more
restaurants than most people do in a lifetime, -
- but the meal I had
at the Flickering Lights, -
- was the worst
I've ever experienced.
But despite the unhygienic tableware -
- and the overcooked,
half-peeled potatoes, -
- I'm giving them four stars anyway.
One for Stefan, one for Peter, -
- one for Arne,
and one for Torkild.
