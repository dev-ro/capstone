You all sang very well, children.
Especially you, Ayse.
Dear children, I can't remember
how long I've lived in this village.
Omer stop your foolish behaviour
at once or I'll come over there.
See, I forgot what I was about say.
So, you all seem quite out of control
on this last school day...
...but I wonder whom you'll be
teasing with when I'm gone.
Are you leaving, teacher?
Yes I am, indeed.
This is what life is all about.
Everything has a beginning and an end.
And you know that I'm not going to
another school, either.
This is my last day as a teacher.
I'm having my retirement.
Finally, I'm getting rid of you.
But life goes on for you.
Pay attention to your new teacher.
Work hard.
No matter what the
conditions may be... I repeat...
No matter what the conditions
may be never give up your school.
Now, your parents can take you
away from the school to make you
work in the fields, vineyards
and gardens. They can force you...
...to get married for the dower.
This is for the girls.
Don't let them do it.
Stand against it. If need be get beaten,
revolt, run away from your houses...
...but go on with your education.
Don't believe anyone who tell you
that this is your unavoidable fate.
Don't forget that you're the
only one who can defeat this fate.
Education means salvation from
ignorance and understanding the world.
It's the ability to change your destiny.
Look at these pictures.
Look at these people. Read over and
over again what they've written down.
They'll show you
the way in my absence.
Now gather before the blackboard.
Come Dilan, Dilan get in your place
boy. Stop pushing one another.
Hey, Omer. Who am I speaking to?
Go over there, girl.
Look at me... Hey, don't budge.
Look over here.
You'll look at me, alright?
I'm shooting.
Omer, come here. I'd taught
you how to use the camera.
You'll press this button here, okay?
Now, I come in between you.
Now, everybody look at Omer.
Come on.
Got it.
Look sister, listen...
If you'll keep on interrupting
I better leave.
No no, please go on.
Get smart. This place is a ruin. You
need a lot of money to pull it together.
No one can offer you as much as I do.
Excuse me for a moment.
Welcome Dünya.
Come, sit over here.
I have a business with this lady.
I'll be with you in a couple of minutes.
You know better than I do
the rents around here.
Let me think
about it for a while, sister.
Don't take too long, Hashmet.
I must see if I'm doing the right thing.
If not, I'll check the alternatives.
Alright, goodbye.
Welcome, sister Dünya.
How are you? Is everything alright?
I'm okay, brother Hashmet.
I arrived today. We settled
in a hotel. How about you?
You know, I survive.
You've brought your daughter.
I have nowhere to leave her.
Did you find her a baby-sitter?
The recepionist's wife
is a cleaning lady.
I tuck a few bucks in her hand.
She'll stay with her at nights.
Good Muhammed!
Look here. What can I order you, sister?
I don't want anything. I'd been
drinking tea the whole day.
Or, you can get me a glass of water.
You know, I've been doing
this water cure. Four litres a day.
Bring us water.
Everything's ready for tonight.
I have arranged your baglama player.
You already know the saz players.
Those guys are really good.
Well, we have also
talked about what you'll get.
Brother, what about escorting?
What about it?
You know, brother.
I don't do it anymore.
Wait a minute. I thought
we had an understanding, gal?
We didn't talk about it thoroughly.
What do you mean "thoroughly"?
You know that the money I make
depends on the drinks.
Actually, I can't make shit anymore.
This place is dead.
Beyoglu is dead for us. Night clubs
are now in the suburbs. In Aksaray.
We're not welcome here anymore, gal.
Beyoglu addresses to the upper class,
the so-called intellectuals and students.
The fashionable momma I just
talked to was a restaurant owner.
She wants to rent this place and
turn it into some kind of night club.
A club for the rich. Glorious stuff.
If you knew her offer you'd lose your
mind. You'd leave everything behind.
So don't push me 'cause I'm looking for
an excuse to get the fuck out of here.
All you have to do is to drink a couple
of drinks. Then, you wonder why...
...Russian women are
better than you.
Yes, it's me.
Are you sure she's in Istanbul?
Where's she staying?
You don't know.
Can we find her?
Thanks.
Alright, I'll take the first bus.
Thank you. Thank you very
much. I'm on my way.
Good day. Do I fill it up?
Separation is a fiery arrow
No word from my coy love
My trouble is greater than all
My trouble is greater than all
Is it possible not to feel the burn
Mountains, mountains, mountains
Welcome...
Thank you very much.
Not at all.
Thanks, thanks.
Thank you very much.
I'll have a smoke. Do you have a light?
So, where do you come from?
Where to, madam?
Findik Palace Hotel.
Do you want to drink
anything before that?
Hey move it man, move it!
How much?
Ten million.
What are you looking at?
- You can't turn away from such beauty.
- Fuck you, asshole!
Thank you, sister.
Oh my God.
Why did you bother?
I'm really embarrassed.
Please, don't mention it teacher.
Godspeed.
God protect you from all evil.
Let me kiss your hand mother.
Mukhtar, take good
care of my mother, or else...
Godspeed, teacher.
Thank you.
Go in peace, teacher.
God protect you.
Thank you.
Don't forget us, teacher.
Could I?
Farewell, teacher.
Farewell, brother Mustafa.
Don't withhold your prayers...
...from us, grand old dervish.
You don't need my prayers, teacher.
You're the grand old dervish yourself.
You are the true father of our children.
You are the mentor.
Grandness suits you best. Godspeed.
Mukhtar, as soon as I rent a house
in Istanbul I'll let you know my address.
I want you all to write to me.
You'll write me about your school.
If I hear anyone leaving school,
I'll come back to punish.
I had this strong belief that the
long years I'd spent as a teacher...
...offered me everything.
I had seen a lot of things.
I had seen pain, death, torture...
...evil, back-stabbing, unfaithfulness...
...and I was left alone. I had felt love,
love unreturned, I had fallen in love...
...tasted disappointment. Villages were
burned down, parents and children...
...were killed an overnight.
And I had stood there watching.
Custom murders were comitted
before my eyes...
...epidemics
had taken away my students...
...and I had cried desperately.
Even God had forsaken us.
Doomed us to Ioneliness.
In the end, I would become a
sinner or a saint.
I don't know what I've
become...
...but as I was about to leave
Alaca Village...
...I thought that there
was nothing left to discover in life.
That I had closed all the books and...
...finished my trade with world.
How fool of me!
Well, I know that this is an old saying
but I need to mention it.
Life is full of surprises till the end.
Till the very end.
You got it... I got it...
Go play inside kids.
You gave us a headache.
You're a mess.
I got the ball. Stop... stop...
I got the ball, I got it.
Children, wait for a while
so that we can finish the laundry.
I swear it was a double five.
I swear to God.
What should I say more!
Why do you look at me like that?
Veysel, am I lying now?
Don't stare at me or I'll break your
head and burn down your cafe.
There's not a single strand of black hair
left on your head but you're still a liar...
and a filthy brawler. Is it worth
all the cheating for one game?
Don't be harsh on my friend.
He may be a liar
but not much of a cheater.
- Is it over?
- It's over.
Thank God. We meet
at last. Oh, brother.
Take it easy.
You're crushing my bones.
Welcome Nazim.
Come, have a seat.
15 years. Boy, 15 years.
So, nothing has changed
much in 15 years.
Everybody is were I put them.
- Welcome, brother Nazim.
- Thank you, Fikret.
Enjoy it.
We got old. We here,
you in the foreign land.
Life is almost over.
What else is left?
My cafe that idiot's taxi, and your
house, inherited from your father.
I looked at it on my way here.
I couldn't get in.
Tenants and children
were inside.
It's like yesterday when we played
where they play today.
Life goes on fast.
Cut the crap, Mr. Retired. You didn't
mention about your arrival in the letter.
Couldn't you fix me a house?
Come on. My name's Chock. There's
nothing I can't fix in the world.
Why don't you stay with the kids?
Memet is married with children.
Nor can I stay with my daughter.
Then, I'm used to being alone.
Is it all taken care of?
Did you rent it?
I even paid for three months
in advance. You owe me.
You're nothing without me, anyway.
Come on, let's see the house.
I want to be sure
you won't complain later on.
You were obstinate
when you were young...
...you get even worse
as you get older.
Your retirement will
be unbearable.
Oh, here we go again.
Blah, blah, blah.
You remember Lady Agavni?
Lady Agavni?
How can I ever forget her.
The lady passed away last month.
May she rest in peace.
You remember her nephew Kirkor.
He came here from Paris
to sell the house.
Get to the point, man!
Alright. In short, Kirkor couldn't sell
the house and he had to go back.
He had to rent the house
with all the furniture.
Thus I, your protective angel,
jumped on him...
...and said "Listen Kirkor,
I must rent"...
Alright, cut it out. I got it.
You're exaggerating again.
That's the house.
God. Everything's
like in the old days.
I used to come here to steal
candies when I was a kid.
What would become of you
was obvious from that day.
Lady Agavni is going to charge
you for that in the next world.
It's okay with me as long
as she didn't in this world.
Let me take a look at the kitchen.
You haven't seen
the kids yet, have you?
No, I haven't.
We're on sale.
The prices are reasonable.
These are installment prices anyway.
I say don't miss it.
- Welcome, sir. Come in.
- Child, I'd like to see Memet.
Father? Excuse me.
- Hi Memet.
- Welcome.
I'm pleased to see you, son.
Ali, can you attend to the lady
please?
Right away, sir.
Come on, let's go over there.
- When did you arrive?
- Today, a short while ago.
Why didn't you call us, father?
We could meet you.
Why bother? You've got work to do.
I was surprised to see you
before me all of a sudden.
I couldn't tell you,
and so you were...
- Does Piraye know?
- No. I didn't tell her, either.
- Wait...
- I guess she changed her number.
What do you want to
drink, father?
I just had tea in
the cafe with my friends.
- Your friends come first, huh?
- I stopped by the cafe...
Piraye, hi. This is Memet.
How are you, dear? Fine fine.
Well, father has come.
No, I mean my real father.
Our father.
Yes, just now. Okay, I will. See you.
How is Piraye?
Who? Oh, Piraye.
Fine. She's fine, dad.
So?
I retired.
- So, you're back for good.
- Yes.
- Well, that's good. It was time.
- Right.
You have improved the business.
Well, I try to do some things.
Ok. I better go now and
you go back to your business.
Would you like
to come visit us tonight?
Alright.
Huh? We can have dinner together
so Piraye can also see you.
- Ok.
- Have you got a place to stay?
I took care of it, son.
I rented a house.
How marvellous, you're fast.
Oh, I'll give you the address now.
- Do you need anything, father?
- Thanks, son. Your concern will do.
Someone entered the class. God,
it was teacher Rifat.
And of course,
suddenly, bam!
God bless his soul.
This is to teacher Rifat.
Your father used make us suffer.
You can't show me a single
person he didn't make suffer.
Once I literally shit my pants
out of fear.
He pulled my ears so strongly
that they stretched about half a meter.
May he rest in peace. He has
put great deal of work on us.
Otherwise, we would
all be tramps today.
At least he succeeded in
making a man out of his son.
Here's to your father.
To teacher Rifat.
To teacher Rifat!
I feel uneasy!
Don't say.
I need to find a job.
Look, if this is about money
I don't want any loan from you,
I told you.
Get your hand out of
your pocket.
Hey, then why are you making
a fuss? What do you want?
A job until I get my bonus.
Until they put me on pension.
Don't be ridiculous. What do you
think you can do at your age?
You can't give special courses.
Nobody would want
a village teacher.
You can't go for mukhtar's office
because the elections have passed.
You can't be a peddler. It wouldn't
be appropriate for you.
It'd bring shame on your father. So?
In fact, I think of opening
a book store or a stationery.
But you see, I have to wait
until I get the bonus.
Anyway, the only thing
I can do is teaching...
...and in the school days I had
driven taxi with you, that's all.
That was for the book
money of course.
Look, don't take this on the
wrong side but you can drive my cab...
...for a while, if you like to.
We could share the money.
Don't talk nonsense. I've been
out of Istanbul for the last 15 years.
During this time it's
size must have doubled.
- I don't know anywhere!
- Nobody knows anyway, man!
Oh my God, I'm late. My son
is waiting for me to go join them...
...for dinner. I need to go.
See you tomorrow.
Give him our regards.
- We are clearing the table.
- Alright, sweetheart.
- Let me help you.
- I can do it.
It's just a couple of dishes,
anyway. I hope you enjoyed it.
Very much, dear. Do you
want some more, father?
No son, I'm full!
So you want to be
a computer engineer?
You grandfather asks
you a question, boy.
Yes!
Come father,
let's sit over there.
Everything was delicious.
I liked it a lot.
How would you like
your coffee, father?
Thanks Piraye. I won't have any.
Otherwise, I can't sleep at nights.
I would like mine
with medium sugar.
Come, father.
The last time you had visited Istanbul
was when Kaan was born I presume.
Correct.
So it's been 15 years.
- Your father retired, right?
- Yes. He's back for good.
Do you know
where he plans to stay?
I guess he rented a house.
Why did you ask?
I just wanted to know. Well, if he's
thinking about staying with us...
...you know that we don't
have enough space.
Father, did you think
about this house issue?
Son, I told you. I've already
rented a house, relax.
No, father. I'm talking
about my grandfather's house.
Brother, your coffee
Thank you, dear.
Where do you live?
She's our neighbour.
She's also in Florya.
- Do you live alone?
- Yes, father.
Fortunately, you
didn't have a child.
That's why we
got divorced, father.
Father, what are we going to do
about the house?
The contractor's sick of asking
about it every single day.
Son, I really don't know. How
can we ask that poor people to leave...
...the house, saying "get out,
we will build a housing development"?
We will do it very well. Father,
they are not paying the rent.
Look, we all need
those appartments.
If you hesitate
leave it to me.
I swear I can throw
them out in a month.
You can't do it like that. As if clearing
the country from the invasion forces.
But that's what they are. They have
invaded that beautiful mansion.
Sorry but you're a little responsible
for that, too.
And those guys are exploiting
your feelings You have to decide now.
I have written to you about it so
many times, you didn't even reply.
It's nice to get letters from
your son even if it's for the house.
Here it is! They've increased
the fuel prices again.
I can't understand why they always
have to increase the fuel prices.
Why the raki, first? Why is it?
Can you please stop bellowing in
the morning. I still couldn't wake up.
Fikret, be quick. People are waiting
for tea. Couldn't you brew it yet?
Come, come here.
Come sit next to me.
What do you want to drink?
How did it go last night?
Never mind. It was ok.
I thought about it the whole night.
I want to drive the cab.
Until I get bonus.
Night job would be fine.
The roads will be isolated.
Anyway, I can't sleep.
Man, are you alright?
You look really pale.
Last night was a little unpleasant.
May be I'm exaggerating it.
- It can be my blood pressure.
- Blood pressure? Let's go to Berrin.
Who's Berrin?
Is sister Berrin at home?
Is she at home?
God damn you, Atakan.
You frighten me each time.
Girl, look who's here.
You don't remember him, do you?
This is Nazim, son of teacher Rifat.
From primary school.
Do you remember?
Oh, hello.
Hello.
Of course, I remember.
But he wouldn't remember me.
I was in first grade
when you were in fifth.
I know you. You used to read
poetry on national holidays.
And we used listen to it
with admiration.
What's wrong?
- Berrin is a widower.
- What's it to me?
What do you mean? You're sick
and I get you a beautiful widower
pharmacist but still
I can't cozy up to you.
Didn't you see how concerned
she was? You have high blood pressure.
You have to be careful
with your health Nazim.
Say one more word and I'll beat
the hell out of you. You vulgar man.
Here it is. I live on this.
From now on it belongs
to the both of us.
Her name is Ceylan.
But don't tell it to anyone.
Even my wife doesn't know
her name. Take good care of her.
Don't push her too much.
Let her go by herself.
Don't take drunks.
If you see a whore, floor the pedal.
Don't get involved with bastards.
They can get you in trouble.
If you don't know the address
of your customer, try to learn
the directions without
giving it away.
You can say something like "which
route do you want me to take."
Don't interrupt quarrelling couples.
You like giving advice. Don't do it.
Alright then. Welcome.
Excuse me pal, which way
leads to Karaköy?
Go straight
Five is enough. This is too much.
Take these and give me the five.
Come in.
Come in, ma'am!
Ma'am I'm talking to you!
- Is it vacant?
- Hey!
Hey, hey! What's going on?
Don't you see the line here?
Are you blind?
Get out.
What? I can take any
cab I want.
There's a line.
We waited here the whole night.
Who told you to wait. God!
Are you bandits? Are you waylayers?
I swear I'll call the police chief.
He was my guest tonight.
Go on, call him, slut.
Look, pop. Get this slut out
of the car and beat it.
Or, we are going to
break your legs.
Hey, hold it right there.
What kind of men are you?
Is this how you treat a woman?
You indecent men. Who do you think
you are to break my leg, huh?
Look, pop.
Don't make me angry.
Hold on a minute guys,
wait a minute. I said hold it...
- Is this brother Atakan's cab?
- Yes!
Let them go.
- Why is that?
- No way.
I said let them go.
Don't touch our brother.
Let it be his way
for tonight.
This is for Atakan brother.
But don't change the line again.
Now beat it. Go on.
Who's Atakan?
Haven't you ever heard
of the name Atakan?
Atakan is a legend man.
Atakan the Chock.
He was the toughest
driver in Istanbul.
Fucking bastards.
They are city bandits.
Did you see the face of the guy
when I mentioned about the chief?
Those are all worthless
sons of bitches.
Excuse my language brother,
but I got exteremly angry.
As if I have to get in his trifling car.
Asshole. Excuse me, brother.
Not at all!
The cops should beat the living
hell out of them in the station.
- Without taking a break...
- Excuse me, ma'am. Where to?
- Did you talk to me?
- Where are we going?
I haven't told you? I've got
garrulous again. I'm sorry.
To Oda Kule.
What was the address?
- Oh, don't you know Oda Kule?
- I don't.
What kind of a cab driver are you?
Really, where are you from?
Excuse me, sister. I'd been living
out of Istanbul for quite a long time.
Of course, you're right.
That's not an excuse.
Never mind, brother. I'll tell you
the directions.
Okay. How much, brother?
- Actually, I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
I don't know, I forgot to turn on the
taximeter in that commotion, sister.
Never mind.
Something's off tonight.
Don't worry about it, brother. It's
alright. It's not the end of the world.
I see many insensitive people in a day.
At least, you feel ashamed.
Oh, you blushed. You're very cute.
Here, take this.
I'll feel bad if you don't.
I paid the same the previous night.
Tonight you got yourself
in trouble because of me.
And also you stood up against
that bozo. You're a real man.
- Have a nice day.
- You, too.
Tomorrow- I mean today can you
pick me up from the hotel at 11 pm?
Dear Mukhtar, how are you?
How are the kids?
I missed you all.
Give my address to the kids...
I owe you the rent. You can cut
it from my share.
No way. I'll take it
when you get your bonus.
So, the guy realized
that it was my car, huh?
He said "brother Atakan," huh?
I've taken you lightly Chock.
You're the king of this jungle.
What king are you talking about?
That was long ago.
Now there's only the name left.
Now, I'm dead scared of getting
into a fight because of a quarrel.
What if I got beaten? What if people
take me a chicken instead of a wolf?
If I lose the fur,
the legend will be over.
That's why I keep
away from trouble.
In the old days I used to
jump right in the middle of it.
Now I turn my head and keep walking.
In fact, this kind of
hurts my pride.
Take this. It's old but it'll do.
If you get yourself into trouble you
can call me. You are in Istanbul now.
Helloo... Merhaba,
good evening, guten morgen.
Good evening. To the club, right?
Where I picked you up yesterday.
Brother, if you have time
let's have a roll sandwich.
Don't misunderstand me. I've got
my daughter a hamburger for dinner.
But I don't put that thing in my
mouth and now I'm starving.
Do me this favor before
I starve to death, huh? It's on me.
So brother, as you can see
I'm shit out of luck.
You didn't tell me your name.
What was your name?
Nazim.
I'm Dunya. Please have
a sandwich, brother Nazim.
I feel uneasy eating like this before you.
I don't want to make your mouth water.
Thank you. I've eaten
before I got out to work.
Ok, I'm just telling you.
Oh, where was I...
I got divorced. Well I did,
but what am I going to do now?
My daughter was
six years old then.
Now she's seven.
No, eight. Seven. Yes, seven.
You see, I'm back
in the old business.
I'm not a bad singer. I don't
sing shouting at the top of my voice.
I have a touching voice. But
of course, club life deteriorates it.
But if I can manage to hold on
in a ballad bar, it'd be very different.
They are tasteful places.
You just do your thing
over there. That's all.
But it's a little difficult after
this point.
- What's your real job?
- Driving.
Bullshit. Your real job is different.
A cab driver doesn't wear a tie.
Also you're way too polite.
Please tell me the truth.
Teaching.
Come on.
- I swear to God.
- Then why are you driving a taxi?
That's life!
That's life. Right. It makes us do
strange things.
Are you married?
I divorced long time ago.
Just like me then.
Do you have children?
Two. A girl and a boy. But they're
grown up. I even have grandchild.
How wonderful! If your kids are
that grown up, then why do they let...
...you get in trouble with those
bastards instead of looking after you?
Don't they pity you?
Oh, I'm late. Let's go, brother. Bill.
May I?
No, you may not.
Please don't be any later than
3 o'clock, brother.
Where to, sir?
NishhhNishhasstsh
Where are you going, sir?
I told you already! We're going
to Nishasstashh.
Pull over.
Stop, stop, stop.
The blue eyes are leaving me
The blue eyes are leaving me
Welcome, sir. Do you
want to take a seat?
I'm Dunya's driver.
I'm waiting for her.
But the show is still on.
I guess it won't take too long.
I can wait over there till it ends.
- Alright. I'll let you know.
- Thank you.
Welcome, sir.
Do you want to take a seat?
- What would you like to drink?
- Raki! Bring Raki!
I feel blue as your eyes
I want to meet you
where nobody else comes
Invite the lady to
my table after her show.
Light the torch, let us go blue eyes
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Good evening. Thank you.
- Why are you here?
- To take you with me.
- Take me where?
- To our house.
We got divorced.
- You'll badly influence your daughter.
- What are you talking about?
Come on. Don't get me started.
Get your hands of me.
Fuck you!
Watch your mouth, or else I'll break it.
- Sir, behave yourself.
- Shut up. Let's go!
- Let go!
- I said, behave yourself.
What are you doing?
Leave her alone.
What's wrong gal?
Are you okay?
I'm okay. I'm okay. Don't worry.
I'm okay. Nothing's wrong,
brother Nazim.
Brother Nazim... no.
Something's stuck into my body.
Brother! Oh, mother, mother.
Help me, brother.
This woman is hurt. Help. Heeyy!
Stop, she's wounded!
She's wounded!
Don't be afraid, girl.
Excuse me. Is the wounded lady
your aquaintance? She woke up.
Thank you, Nazim brother.
If you weren't there, I was dead.
You were right on time.
Brother, I'll ask something of you.
Help me, I beg you. That was my
ex-husband I'd been talking about.
He is a real pyschopath.
If he can find the club
he'll find the hotel, as well.
Don't let that bastard Halil
kidnap my daughter.
What can I do, girl?
This is about your family. I mean
if there's a problem go to the police...
No, brother. You won't
be involved in this.
Just let Hasmet, the owner
of the club, know the situation.
He'd help me. I don't have
his number. Do you think...
...I would bother you
if I had number?
Just tell him about the situation
and give him the hotel's address.
I'll call the hotel, anyway.
There won't be a problem as
I've paid for the week in advance.
Hasmet, too, is like a father to me.
Just let him know.
Tell him to look after my daughter
until I get out of the hospital.
I'll sell this store.
If not, I'll rent it.
What's this? Why all the
sluts and assholes find me?
Why am I so ill-fated?
Sweep carefully, boy. Can't you
see those broken pieces of glass?
Helloo! What is it?
What do you want?
I'd taken Dunya to the hospital.
I'm... er... the taxi driver.
If you came here for the taxi fee,
you'll have to get it from that broad.
Or, is she dead?
No she's not. I don't
want any money, either.
She has a request from you
and I came here to tell you that.
What bores the lady?
She's in some kind of a trouble
with that man. She needs your help.
- It's about her daughter.
- You know what they say, pop.
The water jug brakes
on it's way to the river.
The jug is broken but
it has also turned the store into a ruin.
Look at the damage
she has done.
And now the bitch asks for help?
I won't help.
Bring her bag and the rest
of her stuff and give it to pop.
If I see her around here again,
I swear to God I'll break her legs.
Did Dunya call you?
I came here to
pick up her daughter.
Wake up, girl. Wake up.
Come on, we are
going to your mother.
Yes. No, it's no big deal.
I can be a little late...
...don't worry.
I'm hanging up.
We can talk when I come back.
Don't be afraid honey. Just a scratch.
Uncle, we have taken care of the
patient. The wound is clean.
Everything looks good. You
can take her out of the hospital.
Oh, I'll write a prescription.
We'll take the stitches in a few days.
Oh girl, my one and only...
So, Hasmet has put all the
burden on your shoulders, huh?
Bastard. He's still a good man.
He took care of everything quickly.
That fellow didn't show up, right?
What fellow?
Halil. My ex-husband!
No. You have your
clothes and shoes here.
You can change.
God curse you, Halil.
I hope you'll die and rot in hell.
But wait and see what Hasmet will
do to you.
This time you've got
yourself in big trouble.
If I were you, I wouldn't
trust Hasmet that much.
I'll give you a ride.
Brother, please get back to your
work. I need to think for a while.
Think about what?
In your situation? No way.
I'll be alright. We caused
a lot of trouble. Brother...
You've been up all night.
I pity you. I can deal with the rest.
I just need to pull my head together.
Please go, brother.
Okay. Alright.
Take care.
Goodbye, little miss.
What's wrong, brother?
Do you have anywhere to go?
Any relatives or friends?
Any place to stay?
Not really...
I mean no.
Then, who'll take care of you?
You're wounded. You need to dress
the wound and stuff. Who'll do it?
God watches over me since I was
born. Never mind, we'll be fine.
Come on.
So, Hasmet turned up to
be a real swine, huh?
And I thought I was
a good judge of men.
Who the hell is he? He's going to
break my legs, my ass!
Be quiet. You're wounded
and you feel pain.
You're bleeding!
We need to find someone
to dress your wound.
- I'm fine.
- No. Go inside and lie down.
- I'm okay.
- I'll be back in no time.
Nevcivan will eat dust.
Don't you have anything better to do
than gambling?
What's up? You're talking sweet again.
What was that you said
on the phone all about?
There was a fight in the club.
A woman got hurt
and she has a daughter.
Her husband is a troublemaker.
She has nowhere to go...
...so I brought
her home, okay?
Are you happy now that
you know everything?
What happened Nazim?
Is it you high pressure again?
How did this happen?
By accident. She tripped over the chair,
fell on the glass table...
...it broke and stuck in her body.
A few centimeters higher
and it was in her heart.
What is the lady to you?
Let me put it this way.
I was passing by.
Where?
Where the accident occured.
Cab driving is a strange job.
You can come across
with anything, anytime.
That was one of them.
Dunya is a stranger in Istanbul.
Of course, somebody had to help her.
I did my duty as a responsible
citizen.
Don't skip the antibiotics.
If bleeding recurs call me.
How much do we owe you, Berrin?
You owe me nothing.
Just buy the medicine.
Thank you, we caused you trouble.
Not at all. I did my duty
as a responsible citizen.
And you shouldn't exaggerate your duty.
There are so many strangers...
...and wounded people in Istanbul
that it is impossible for a cab...
...driver to deal with them all.
Goodbye.
Are you hungry? What do
you want to eat? Huh?
I think you didn't like me at all.
You don't make a sound, girl.
She doesn't speak.
What do you mean she doesn't speak?
She doesn't. One day his father
attacked me. The house was...
...like a war ground.
The man had gone crazy.
Melek got very scared when
she saw her father acting like a maniac.
Her eyes got wide open.
She went into shock.
She'd never seen Halil acting
like that before.
That day she became mute.
She was about four years old.
Maybe three.
Or, was it two? No, three.
Well, didn't you take her to a doctor?
Of course, I did. I showed
her to every kind of doctor.
From child doctors to shrinks.
When they couldn't find a cure,
I showed her to hodjas.
You won't believe but I even tried
Mother Mary's blessed water.
She didn't say a word.
Then, we got used to it.
Thank you, Mustafa.
Why did you dress us down? It's said
that you have a woman in the house.
You're such a gossip.
A gossip, a trickster and a liar.
You should be ashamed
of yourself.
- I won't work tonight.
- Why not?
I have a woman in the house...
remember. God's sake!
What did he look like?
He had white hair.
- A driver, huh?
- Yes.
He left taking the girl with him.
Don't you really know where he's gone?
No, I really don't know.
What kind of a hospital is this?
How can you not know?
Buzz off.
Get your hands of me, you dick.
I'll show you who's the dick,
you son of a bitch.
I've given you her hotel's address.
What else do you want, you maniac?
She's not there. She has left. How
many more times should I say?
What's it to me if you've the wrong
address. Ask the fucking woman...
He used to drive Atakan's cab.
He was on the night shift.
But I haven't seen him
since that unpleasant night.
Well, where can I find Atakan?
Atakan is from Samatya.
He hangs around the cafe.
Samatya... Thank you.
By the way, to whom does
that medal belong to? What is it?
To my grandfather. He was
a veteran of the War of Independence.
What about your father?
My father was a teacher, too.
Oh, just like you. Did I ever tell
you that I loved my primary school...
...teacher the most.
I mean after my mother.
No.
Come here, honey.
Wouldn't it be better
if you didn't go out?
I'm bored to death, bother Nazim.
I need to get some fresh air.
Do you want tea?
If it's still hot... Let me ask you
something.
Does Atakan
hang around here?
- Yes, he does.
- Where's he?
He's taken his car to repair shop.
It's said that he works a driver.
In fact, I'm looking for him.
Ask it to Atakan. Bring tea over here.
Do you want to have fish for tonight?
Well, we'll go to the
greengrocery with Melek.
Hello, Nazim.
What's up, Mustafa?
Can I help you, ma'am?
How's the fish? What do you suggest?
How's it going? Good?
Nothing missing, huh?
Look at its gills... it's crimson.
Okay, okay, I've got it. It's fresh.
Do you want me
to give you an apple candy?
