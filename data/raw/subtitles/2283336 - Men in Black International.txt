God, do I hate Paris.
Well, not to worry.
Probably won't be
around much longer.
I've been waiting a
long time for this.
I guess wh-what I'm
trying to say is...
- Lisa, will you ma...
- Bonjour!
We're with Tower security.
Uh, we're terribly sorry but
you're not supposed to be here.
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
So... she say yes?
- I haven't asked yet.
- He hasn't asked yet.
Oh, that's such a terrible
shame, isn’t' it?
Because you see,
that blinking light back there
means that there's been
a breach in portal two.
Which means,
in just a few minutes,
the most vile creatures in
the entire universe, the Hive
are gonna consume every last
one of us from the inside out.
I-I-I don't understand.
All will be explained
if look right...
here.
The Tower's closed for repairs.
Ask her on the way down.
This way, please.
Thank you.
Mind the gap.
Right.
Shall we?
Let's do this.
Hey, guys.
Who the hell are you?
Ask her again
down on the ground.
- Whoo.
- Ah, there you are.
All right, let's try this again,
shall we?
So, what's the play here?
We've been in this
situation before.
We've never faced the Hive before.
They've never faced us.
Always remember,
the universe has a way of leading
you to where you're supposed to be
at the moment you're
supposed to be there.
Yeah, well, sometimes
the universe gets it wrong.
Some action!
I want some asses wigglin'.
I want some perfection.
Bwa-ha!
Get my 3-wood.
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay, okay!
Careful.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my...
- Baby.
- Mm-hmm?
Uh...
That wasn't no animal, okay?
It was uh... It was a-a...
I ain't never seen nothin'
like that before. It's uh...
It was like a creature.
What?
Harold, call the police.
- The who?
- The police, call the police!
That was fast.
Good evening folks.
We're from Animal Control.
You say you saw something?
Yeah, we haven't even
called you yet.
Are we in any danger?
D-Does it have, like, rabies?
Whatever that was, it wasn't like
a regular animal. It was like a...
Yes, sir. The creature
you saw was an
unlicensed Terrantian
from Andromeda II.
Very rare, very dangerous.
- I'm sorry, what?
- Uh, Terrantian, ma'am.
Now, I know, he looks cute now...
Terrantian?
they turn into real monsters.
Sshhh.
Don't be scared. It's okay.
Tell me, is there
anyone else in the house?
Just our daughter.
She's sleeping.
A raccoon!
Yeah, that's your problem, folks.
So just go ahead
and make sure those
trash can lids are
on nice and tight.
And, uh, we were never here.
Maybe we should
go check on Molly.
We've gotta get you out of here.
Come on.
It's okay.
I'm your friend.
I'm Molly.
Go on.
Molly.
Kavula Nachshulin.
Well, Molly, you scored
excellent or above in every area.
Fitness, deductive reasoning,
logic, weapons training.
Just... one problem.
You, uh, didn't check a box.
Field preferred division.
Everyone has to check a box.
Hmm.
Yeah, I made my own box...
for the division that has...
no box.
You know, the division where
they wear black suits and...
deal with the guys from...
Up there.
You mean Accounting?
No, like...
Yeah, still...
Accounting.
This should fix the glitch.
Now remember, we care.
And just remember, we care.
Look for the icon marked
Advanced Extensions.
- Click on it.
- We tried that. Which one?
- 13th icon from the left.
- Whose left?
- Your left.
- Okay, sorry...
Okay. Got it?
- What's going on?
- Oh, no, nothing.
Let me just run a little
diagnostic on my end.
And I will be right back to you.
No, no, no, it won't take long.
Not long at all. Okay.
What the feh...?
This is perplexing.
Is it...?
Is it...?
A-L-I-E-N-S?
I don't know why you always insist
on whispering and spelling that.
Finally decided to show up, huh?
Oh, my God.
All I have to do is figure
out trajectory and I am in.
I'm back. Okay, try this.
Unplug it, plug it back in.
And remember, we care.
I have to go.
Jimmy's coming back
to get the kids.
Yes!
Okay.
Let's see where you are now.
Welcome back,
Professor Armitage.
Oh, you tricky one.
I don't think you're a
meteor after all, are you?
Nope.
I think you are an
unauthorized landing.
This is it.
It's all happening.
See you soon, Jimmy.
Right here, right here.
Here.
Hey, hey!
Hey, please keep
the meter running.
I'll pay you extra.
What? Oh...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on, Jimmy.
What are you doing
back on Earth?
Whoa. This is... This is Earth?
My bad, guys. Come on.
Tell it to O back at HQ.
Look, I just wanna see my kids.
- Get this ship outta here!
- Got it.
I'll escort our
Zamphorian friend back.
Don't lose them.
What? I'm on it. Got it.
Go, go, go! Go!
Hey, did they bring in
that Zamphorian yet?
Came in a couple of
minutes ahead of you.
I mean, the guy tried to sneak in
behind a Perseid meteor shower.
Amateur hour. Am I right?
Right as rain.
Rain don't lie.
Sheesh, talk about amateur hour.
Hey, you gonna
call this in or what?
Code: Black.
Unauthorized visitor.
Lockdown protocol engaged
in three, two, one.
All right.
Who's she working for?
She claims to be working alone.
A random civilian simply
waltzes in off the High Street.
I don't think so.
Neuralyze her.
No, no, no! Don't.
I know what that thing is.
Please.
Hang on. Hang on.
She had an experience.
It erased my parent's memories
but it didn't take mine.
My whole life,
everyone's called me crazy.
They said that I needed therapy.
Which, okay, admittedly, I did.
But not for this.
Did she really hack into
the Hubble telescope
to look at Andromeda II
and we didn't catch her?
In the old days,
we'd have hired her.
It took me 20 years to find you.
Plus or minus.
How many people can say that?
I found you.
So, you found us.
You've proved you're not crazy.
You win the I'm-Not-Crazy badge.
Now, what?
I want in.
We don't hire, we recruit.
Then, I'd like to be recruited.
I'm going to need more, but...
would you mind giving
me one good reason?
Because I'm smart.
I'm motivated.
I look good in black.
- I'm...
- Boring me.
Because I have absolutely
no life whatsoever.
I have nothing.
I have no dog, no cat.
Definitely no chil.
I have nothing that I couldn't
happily walk away from,
which makes me
perfect for this job.
Well, you're certainly
suitably tragic.
No love? No relationships?
They just distract you
from what's important.
Mm, really?
And what's important?
The truth of the universe.
I wanna know everything.
I wanna know how it all works.
You really think a black suit
is going to solve
all your problems?
Mmm, no, but...
it looks damn good on you.
That's true.
Yeah
From this moment,
you will conform to the
identity we give you.
You will dress only in
MIB Special Services attire.
You have been trained in
the use of MIB-sanctioned
technology, vehicles,
and weaponry.
Mm-mm.
You will not stand out in any way.
You are no longer
part of the system.
You do not exist.
Check, please.
We are above the system.
Over it, beyond it.
We are them, we are they.
We are the Men in Black.
The Men in Black?
Don't. Don't start.
I've had the conversation.
And they didn't seem
to be able to let it go.
It's a... it's a process.
The attachment issue, I think.
There's your first assignment.
Okay.
When do I get my, uh... zzz?
It's called a neuralyzer and you
don't just get it, you earn it.
You've been accepted
for a probationary period.
Impress me,
and we'll see about the zzz.
- Okay.
- Mmm.
You're a fan of the truth,
aren't you, Agent M?
- I like it.
- Mmm.
I think we may have
a problem in London.
Now, that is smooth.
Let's keep 'em coming, shall we?
Another round.
So, can I just say how
much I'm liking this place?
You know, it's formal
but not too stuffy.
And in a classic but
still kinda stylish.
Makes it a very nice,
wide shot kinda vibe.
Kidding.
Sort of.
Woohoo!
Or is it mostly just the
lethal high-stakes gambling?
Thank you very much.
Would you look at that?
Straight to the ace, gentlemen.
It's me again.
Well, let's talk
business, shall we?
I can move this stuff.
So who do I speak with about
getting a whole lot more of it?
Because I'm in.
You're not.
You see, I have a very strict
no Men in Black policy.
Oh, God.
I don't blame you.
Who'd want those
assholes coming in here?
Pfff. Men in Black.
Morons in Black, if you ask me.
What a bunch of dicks.
Am I right?
All it takes is one bad apple
to spoil any environment...
Guys.
I am MIB, you Corellian scum.
And FYI,
your little pub here sucks.
And you're gonna
give me everything.
Supplies, sellers,
your whole network.
Your luck ran out.
You're already dead.
Only one person here
has the antidote.
Emily, sweetheart.
Please, I'll...
I'll give you whatever you want.
Please!
Anything you want.
Anything I want?
The express train to
London has arrived.
With continuing service to
Paris, Stockholm,
Milan, Rome, Madrid.
Found him in the locker room.
I knew that kid was
neuralyzing himself.
I told him, "do that too much
and you'll go blind."
Who could go for a nosh?
I'd like a nice pastrami sandwich.
And awesome healthy sweets, too.
Now arriving,
express train form New York.
Last call for Flight 2112
to the Cat's Eye Nebula
boarding at Gate 32.
Welcome, Agent M.
Please report
to New Agent Orientation.
Access granted. Agent M.
Excuse me, ma'am.
It's never who you think it is.
Oh, no. That one makes sense.
So, you're the one who found us.
Yes. I am.
I'm T. High T.
Oh, yeah. You're uh...
- I run this little circus.
- Yeah.
Welcome, M.
It's nice to meet you, sir.
O told me to expect
some great things.
And great things shall you get.
Right through there.
Hi, you.
Oh, wait, wait, wait!
Don't touch him!
Oh, oh. Oh, God.
Change it, change it.
All right, buddy.
All right.
Try this.
Oh, careful!
You break it, you buy it.
Keep it.
Keep it. On me.
We need to see the Queen.
Yes.
Uh-oh.
You have visitors.
State your business with the Queen.
We need someone to die.
As clearly stated in Section 6C
of the Treaty of Andromeda II,
we do not kill Jababians
nor participate in
the murder thereof.
This is non-negotiable.
Well, it's slightly negotiable.

Oi!
Morning.
I'm in that market for a
useless, old, broken down machine.
What do you got?
You're not gonna get
a rise out of me, H.
It's the Imperial with the red tab.
Do try to keep up.
Thank you, Charlie.
That's the old portal depot.
Site of the first
great alien migration.
Wait, so, Eiffel was and MIB agent?
One of the first.
He helped so many
intergalactic refugees seeking
protection here on Earth.
If you look closely,
you can see my grandma and
my grandpa in that picture.
So beautiful.
- Here you are, dear.
- Thank you.
What's up with that guy?
Nerlene!
Sorry.
He's just so yummy.
Who is he?
H, only the best agent
in the building.
He saved the world once
with nothing but his wits
and a Series-7 De-Atomizer.
He saved the world?
From what?
The Hive.
The Hive.
Hey, Guy, do me a favor.
Handle my calls.
Oh, love to.
Where are you going?
To do some homework.
An awful, terrible
incident in Marrakesh.
The North Africa office
is investigating.
And in other business,
H has decided to grace us
with his presence after all.
Apologies, sir, I was working late.
Morning, everyone.
So was I, actually, cleaning up after
your mess, so thank you for that.
Oh, you should've seen the mess
I was cleaning up this morning.
It was a totally
unsanctioned op, sir
requiring two containment units
and a full neuralyzer squad.
A-About that, all right,
I-I prefer to look at this
at a macro point of view,
not get bogged down
in the details.
The bad guy's dead,
so, you know.
Take a seat, please.
Just one last item.
A member of the
Jababian royal family
has a layover on his
way to Centaurus A.
Vungus the Ugly.
Inherited the title.
Believe it or not,
Vungus here is the
looker in the crowd.
Holograms always add ten pounds.
Jababian society doesn't allow
for certain indiscretions.
In short, he wants to be
shown a good time.
We could say no.
But Jababian mining vessels would
grind us into galactic dust.
Some irony there, sir,
if you think that we used to, uh,
protect the Earth from
the scum of the universe.
Now, it seems we're
protecting the scum.
Actually, that's why it would be
right up your street.
Your cup o' tea, H.
Well, I know Vungus,
he doesn't really drink tea.
He prefers vodka, tequila,
hand sanitizer, sometimes all at once.
This one time, we woke up in
Bangkok handcuffed to a horse...
- But H...
- Pipe down.
Sorry. Yes, apologies.
You will be his chaperone.
In fact, he specifically
asked for you.
Okay, absolutely.
Hopefully we don't end up
handcuffed to a horse again.
Please.
Have him home by midnight.
Good boy.
If you will.
Good boy, if you will.
Good man, I think he said.
Keep daddy happy, yeah.
We're like this.
You look after puppies so well.
You're so jealous, aren't you?
Puppy's little fancy boy.
You wish you had a puppy.
Uh...
Hello.
Ooh! Oops.
Sorry.
Hi.
No. I'm awake. Sorry.
Just catching up on
my daily meditation.
I have been meaning to try that.
I've read that it
dramatically improves
mitochondrial energy production.
Yup, yup, it absolutely does.
My mitochondrial energy's
through the roof.
Uh, have we met before?
No. Agent M.
I heard you were on
the Vungus meet tonight
and I wanted to
offer my assistance.
I'm a bit of a Jababian wonk.
Language, culture,
politics, fashion.
Um, anyways, I compiled a
dossier for you to read.
Oh, a dossier,
I love a good dossier.
Um, thing is,
ask around, I-I work alone.
Yeah, ask anyone around here.
Did you know that Jababians
are claircognizant empaths?
Which means that they can
basically read your mind.
Oh, and your cards.
Well, they do have a tell.
What's that?
Subdermal spots on the
underside of their arms
change color.
Mm, good to know.
But, uh, thank you for your offer.
I'm good.
Okay. Message understood.
I will leave you to your... mediation.
Thank you.
Oh.
Do you know what your tell is?
You snore when you meditate.
Actually, on second thought,
m-maybe I could use
some backup.
So, I was thinking for the op,
I can take the perimeter
and you
make the approach to Vungus.
Ah, yes, good.
Um, the thing is...
Right, with this particular club,
Everybody just wants to
kinda do their own thing.
You know, the aliens
wanna look like humans,
humans wanna look like aliens.
So we may need to loosen up.
Maybe... maybe lose the tie first.
Yeah?
Pop a coupla buttons.
And not look so, uh... stiff.
We don't wanna advertise our
current profession,
if you know what I mean.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
Look, it's the Men in Black!
Aliens, get down!
- We don't wanna do that.
- Yeah, I get it.
Yeah? Good?
Great. Perfect.
How 'bout me? How do I look?
I would just, uh...
- Do you mind if I...?
- What?
Comin' in.
I think it's a fine line between
club casual and
saddest man on Earth.
Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.
Shall we?
- I thought that we were here.
- We are.
Entrance for special guests.
Step on it, would you, Freddy?
You got it, H.
Yeah, okay, wasn't expecting that.
The Vungus among us!
H bomb!
Look at you, you've lost weight.
What have you done to your hair?
You've changed it. Looks fantastic!
I barely recognize you.
Sorry. M, this is Vungus.
Vungus, M.
Hello, M!
So nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.
Highly redacted, of course.
Such a charmer. He says...
He thinks you're hot.
He thinks I'm what? Sorry.
It's a rough translation, of course.
Probably works better on
Jababia, but...
You know that, since
you speak fluent Jababian.
Oh.
Of course.
I was just trying to find the
words to articulate how incredibly
- eye-catching you yourself are.
- Eh?
Oh, that he is.
M here knows everything there
is to know about Jababia.
Well, I wouldn't say everything.
There's always more to learn.
It's like a fetish.
Okay, that implies something sexual
and it's definitely not.
Oh, it is. It's always like,
Oh, Jababia this, Jababia that.
Jababia, Jababia, Jababia!
Ya, baby! Whipoosh!
See, I knew the two
of you would hit it off.
Have a dance, okay?
M loves to dance.
She's a wonderful dancer.
I'll get us some drinks.
You still a vodka cranberry guy?
You know it.
Okay. Go on.
M, please.
Come, sit next to Vungus.
I promise I don't bite.
Okay, just give me one sec.
Let's get us
four vodka cranberries
It's all right, I'll get this one.
Put it on the company card.
A little tip, expense, everything.
Hey, quick question, no big deal.
Are you, uh,
pimping me out to Vungus?
What? No!
What the hell would give you that...
impression?
Hello?
Oh, I don't know. That?
Oh. Well.
Better not look at that.
Hey, if you wanna
use me as alien bait,
just let me know
next time, okay?
I don't like to be lied to.
Oh, really? What, like, uh,
pretending to be an expert
on something you're not?
In case you haven't noticed,
we're in the lying business.
Are we?
Jababians are prickly.
We want them to be happy, okay?
So they don't destroy our
planet and everything on it.
And that is the mission.
- If you're not down with the mission...
- I'm down with the mission.
But I'm not fornicating
with a Jababian.
That's not what I
asked you to do.

Vodka cranberries

Let's get his car,
get him outta here.
Okay.
Get you off to bed.
Let's get you in here.
All right, there you are, buddy.
In you go. Oh, whoa, whoa.

Okay. Now, sleep it off, okay?
I'll speak to you

Hoo!
Shouldn't we call it in?
God, no!
The paperwork is a nightmare.
Yeah, but Vungus
didn't look too good.
I mean, he didn't look
too good before, but...
Trust me,
I've seen him way worse.
This one time, when...
Help me.
- MIB, freeze!
- On the ground.
- Hands up.
- Palms down.
- Palms down.
- Hands up.
Okay, w-which do I go with?
I'm fine with either.
I just think, in the future,
we're gonna have to come up
with something consistent.
You want palms down?
If you don't mind.
- Palms down.
- Palms down.
Good.
What the...?
That doesn't look good.
Run!
M!
They are coming!
Petrol cap, go!
We need more firepower!
Side view mirror.
What do you want me to do,
throw it at them?
Oh, wow.
I haven't seen that before.
I don't think this
is doing anything!
Come on!
Exhaust pipe, go!
Come on!
Now, this is more like it.
Right.
Hurry!
Go to Vungus, I'll cover you.
H! A little help here!
No!
Not H.
He has changed.
I could feel it.
I have to know...
if I can trust you.
Now, I'm pissed off!
Hide this.
Something is wrong
in Men in Black.
Vungus, what is this?
It's the only thing
that can protect you.
Come on!
Lemme see your
fancy dance moves now!
Freeze! Lock it down! Move!
What the...?
How is he?
He's gone.
Oi, totally outdone
yourself here, mate.
- Well done.
- Thank you.
Well done. Fill me in.
What happened?
- Huh?
- We were attacked, clearly.
She came by, I don't know what....
The suspects...
They did this with
their bare hands.
They turned solid into liquid
and then back again.
What?
Why is she here?
She...
- She is walking you
- She is walking you
- through the crime scene.
- through the crime scene.
No, no.
She is a probationary agent.
So she... is not here at all, okay?
I think you'll find that she...
clearly is here
'cause I can-I can see her.
- Backin' you up.
- Thank you.
It was a figure of
speech, but fine.
Shh, you are in so much trouble.
Oh, my God, you had one job.
You had one very simple job.
To take some lizard slimeball
out for a few drinks, that was it...
Not, not! Not a lizard slimeball,
a friend of mine.
- Oh, no, sorry. Sorry about that.
- Mm.
He was a reptilian slimeball.
He's now dead because of you.
- Who was with him when he died?
- I was.
Okay, good.
And did he say anything that
might explain why he was killed?
Anything at all?
Come on.
No. Not a thing.
So just to recap, um...
No point.
A high-ranking member of
the Jababian royal family
dies on your watch
murdered by assailants
that you can't identify
for reasons that you
cannot begin to fathom.
Is that-Is that about right?
I switched off the moment you
started talking. I don't know.
Now, why don't you bugger off?
Okay, mate, yeah.
- Thank you. I'll piss off.
- Yeah.
- Back to the office.
- Where you belong.
- To have a little word with High T
- Oof.
who will not save you this time.
We'll be fine, okay?
Don't-Don't worry. It's just...
We'll be fine.
Yes. Yes. Understood.
Yeah. Indeed.
Yes.
Y-Yes. Yes.
Thank you.
L-Let me assure you,
we will deal with this
in the strongest possible terms.
The Jababians want your heads.
Quite literally.
Both heads sent by
diplomatic pouch.
Okay, um...
Morning, sir.
I have the, uh,
forensics report that you asked for.
Thank you.
Well, this is troubling.
- Very troubling.
- Mm-hmm.
These are our suspects.
A species called Dyadnum
from a binary star system
in the constellation Draco.
Draco, that's Hive territory.
The entire sector fell years ago.
A Dyad's DNA.
- Riddled with Hive mutations.
- Mm-hmm.
And as we all know,
the Hive doesn't just
destroy their enemies.
They subsume them.
Take them over from within.
Which means whoever these two
were, they're part of the Hive now.
Yes, but why would the
Hive send them all this way
to kill a Jababian royal?
You knew Vungus
better than anyone.
Did he indicate why he was here?
Did he want something from us?
No, he seemed pretty
normal, pretty happy...
Sir! This whole
thing is a fiasco.
It's a farrago.
And a failure of this magnitude
requires immediate
invokement of...
Article 13.
Don't be a dick.
Who says farrago?
Uh, uh, what is Article 13?
Immediate termination.
Followed by...
neuralyzation.
- Wait a second. No.
- Wait.
Is that you people's
answer to everything?
- Put that away.
- Take your glasses off.
S-Sir, you can't.
Give me one good reason why not?
Um, because it's...
W... What we're talking
about, uh...
- Because...
- Because...
If you erase us...
- you will never know the truth.
- The truth.
Come on, sir,
they're obviously stalling.
Say the word, I'll do it.
Put it away.
M, go ahead. Explain yourself.
Well, sir.
If you think about it,
really think about it,
Vungus.
How many people really
knew that he was here?
The people in this room.
And perhaps a dozen
high level agents.
If those were the only people
that knew where Vungus would be,
Mm-hmm.
And we assume that
Vungus didn't leak
his own location to the killers.
Doesn't that mean
that it was someone...
inside MIB?
A mole, sir,
inside these very walls.
Sir, they're obviously making
this up as they go along.
What are you talking
about, a mole?
In the whole history
of the company,
there's not been so much
as a leak. Mole.
Sounds like something
a mole would say.
- Don't be absurd.
- Classic mole talk.
Sounds like Mole 101.
Enough.
If we've been compromised,
It puts every citizen
on this planet
both human and alien at risk.
- C.
- Sir.
Track down these killers.
- Find the killers, we'll find the mole.
- Will do, sir.
Dismissed.
M, it appears you're
as sharp as advertised.
Work the case with C.
And get Weapons
Department started
on something that can
neutralize these Dyads.
Yes, sir.
Sharp indeed she is, sir.
So, I assume you'll want
me overseeing the case.
Sort of, uh, supervise...
I'm finished covering for you, H.
You need me on this case, sir.
I-I've dealt with
the Hive before, remember?
With nothing b-but my wits
- and my Series-7...
- No!
He dealt with the Hive before.
And I don't know where
the hell he has gone.
I actually used to think
you could lead this place.
I was wrong about you.
We're done here.
That's an order.
Look, you weren't
wrong about me, sir.
You saw something in me once.
It's still there.
I apologize for letting you down.
Give me another chance
and I'll fix this, T, I promise you.
I don't think it's just a blade.
Looks like it carries
some sort of poison.
I want you to, uh...
Wait, sorry, mate.
High T decided he wants
me to run point on this one.
Wait. What?
Sorry, I don't believe you.
Look, I don't like it
any better than you.
But he kept going on
about relying on me.
Needing our top agent,
that sort of thing.
I don't make the rules
Take it up with him.
M, he's keen for you
to shadow me on this one.
- Learn from the best, he said.
- I-I...
Little on-the-job
training, if you will.
Hmm? Yeah?
Come on.
- Uh...
- Are you going or you staying?
- Yeah, I'll-I'll go.
- Yeah, all right, well...
- Okay.
- Come on.
H?
Well, thanks for that.
I'm sick of you.
Okay.
So, what's the actual truth?
Well, you tell me, because
for someone who hates lying,
that was incredible!
- I wasn't...
- Come on, that was electric up there.
The way we played off
each other, back and forth.
I was riffing.
"A mole inside MIB."
Gosh, genius.
Wish I thought of it myself.
And I discovered a possible truth.
I mean, think about it.
It would explain a lot.
So, what have you got so far?
I was about to run a molecular
deconstruction on the substance
and cross-reference
with all known toxins.
Mm, good idea.
Oh! Wouldn't do that.
Whoo! I know what that is.
Yeah, that killed a
300-pound Jababian,
so I wouldn't get
recreational with it.
That is zephos, pure grade.
The wrong amount will
kill you instantly.
The right amount will
keep you dancing shirtless
on a nightclub table in Monaco
for about 17 hours straight.
So much information.
Always so much information.
I mean, it's what I've heard anyway.
There's only one place in the world
with the know-how to mix it.
Let's go.
You comin'?
World's not gonna save itself.
Are you saying that you
need me to save the world?
Uh-huh.
Thought so.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, you'll see that
a lot around here.
They're a chameleon tag.
In their galaxy, a symbol
for hope or annihilation.
There's still some debate
around what exactly.
Actually, it's harmony.
But on Earth it means we're
on training MIB's, safe haven.
How do you know that?
It's in the handbook.
Don't believe
everything you read.
That is my job.
And my job is what?
Hang out here and shut up?
Yes, you shut up.
That is your job.
Well, look who it is, Nasr.
Come on, you know the rules.
No visible alien tech
anywhere on the street.
Cover the bike up before
I have to give you a ticket.
H?
It is really you?
Of course it's me.
Who else could it be?
Hey, Bassam.
Hi, H. Nasr said
you were dead.
What? I-I never said that.
You did. He's lying.
Hey! Get... that...
Why would I be dead?
Bassam misunderstood.
We heard that you and Riza
had... split up.
Ooh, Riza. Who's that?
Not important.
Mm. Human or...?
Doesn't matter.
Just curious how it
works between species.
Very unimportant
old friend of mine, so...
Who runs the biggest criminal
syndicate in the galaxy.
Who is a very successful
businesswoman.
I love a businesswoman.
Okay, why are we
talking about this?
So sad, H. You-
You made a lovely couple.
Okay, thank you very much.
But these things happen.
You said, "That psycho's
gonna slit his throat."
Um...
Excuse us for one moment.
Your words, not mine.
Don't you...!
You dated this-this person?
It seems like a conflict of interest.
Conflict of interest for you
to know about my private life.
Yeah, sure, I would prefer
not to know that.
Hey, Th-that's enough. Listen.
- Hoo!
- Stop beating the hell out of him.
- Yeah!
- Keep this thing covered up.
Absolutely. Will do.
- Thank you.
- Won't happen again.
Nice to meet you both.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Uh...
What?
Pulled this from the surveillance
camera outside the club.
Standing there, making
me feel uncomfortable.
Sorry 'bout that.
Have you shown this to T?
He said everything
goes through you.
Yes, everything does
go through me. Good.
I'll show him.
Go on.
Goodness me.
Oh, boy.
Here comes trouble.
I like trouble.
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Call Riza.
Oh, here, this is it.
Looks like a couple day's worth.
No one's been around to collect.
Hello?
One more step and I'll liquify
your pants, pretty boy.
Easy, easy, we don't
want any trouble.
Do not move!
Hey, look at you.
What do they call you, sport?
"Sport" is not what you call me.
What is it?
It? He.
- Sorry.
- Why would you call me anything?
Pawns don't have names.
We're pawns.
Uh, okay. Pawny, then.
What happened here?
Oh, we had the best party.
Kanye showed up and dropped,
like, a whole new album.
And it was some
of his best work.
Look around.
We got our asses kicked!
My Queen!
Oh, she's gone.
I'll never serve another,
I swear it.
I'll plunge my dagger into
my own body, like this.
Through all my vital organs
and then leave it
until the dark takes me.
Hey...
You're not actually gonna go
through with this, are you?
Listen, a queen's pawn
without a queen is just
a pawn!
A nothing.
I must end my own life
in the most...
painful way possible.
Don't stop me.
Chance of survival:
Zero.
- Do you think we should stop him?
- Gonna do it.
Kinda wanna see if he
goes through with it.
Uh, sorry. What did you say?
Hmm? Nothing at all.
No, you know what,
I did say something.
You did?
Yeah. He's a witness.
Excuse me.
You know,
I don't think that she would
want you to, you know...
go through with it, honestly.
Who are you to know what a
queen would or wouldn't want?
Are you a queen?
Well, I mean, to the extent
that all women are, yes.
But no. No.
I'm not a queen.
You know what she is,
though, is an agent.
- A-gent?
- Mm-hmm.
Is that a title?
It is a title.
A title of great
eminence and stature.
M here is an agent.
An agent without a pawn,
if you see my meaning.
I never thought of this.
But maybe the best
way to honor the dead
is to go on living.
Yes!
I pledge loyalty eternal
to you, Agent M!
No, no, no. I'm not
interested in a subject.
Too late. It's done. I already
pledged the loyalty.
I wish you'd said
no, no, no before.
Congratulations.
And if you should
die before I...
I promise to end my own life
In the most painful way possible.
Yeah. Ha.
I don't like you.
Let's go.
My lady?
Come on. We'll have a fun time.
- Fine.
- Yes!
H, there's something that I've
been meaning to tell you about
I been wanting to tell you...
- Yeah?
- About it... where?
- You mean this?
- Is it?
- You stole it from me?
- "Stole it from me."
I recovered evidence which
you stole from a crime scene.
Vungus told me to hide it,
and that I couldn't
trust anyone, so.
You're telling me y-y-you
listened to Vungus?
You trusted Vungus
instead of your partner,
a senior agent?
- Huh?
- In a word, yes.
H, speaking of agents.
Come on.
Why would they be here?
There's either an award
show we're not aware of
or we're in deep shit.
Thank you. I need you
to close every street,
every archway
and every sewer, now.
Come in close from that
body cam there, please.
Could someone
please explain to me
what the hell is going on?
Ah, sir, slightly sensitive subject.
Thought it best to keep it quiet.
A bit further in, please.
C! A word.
Absolutely. No one leaves
the Medina, all right?
This.
This is nonsense.
Despite your personal feelings,
H is one of the best agents
ever to wear the suit.
No, sir, he was one of the
best agent to wear the suit.
He hasn't been the same since
the incident with the Hive.
Look. Look.
My sources say
that Vungus stole it
from the Jababian War Department
Advanced Reseach Division
and brought it here.
And you kept this from me.
For how long?
Explain yourself.
Oh, explain myself?
Sir, whatever that thing is,
M and H had it in your office.
And you let them go, sir.
With all due respect,
you let them go.
Carry on.
Yes, sir.
- And C.
- Sir.
Bring them straight to me.
Whatever that thing is,
Vungus died to protect it.
He gave it to me
so it wouldn't go to them.
Yes, sir.
H, listen to me.
This isn't my operation.
Get out of there.
Get safe. Then report.
M might be right.
I want sitreps every 10 minutes.
There could be a
mole in Men in Black.
All right.
Take this. I'll draw them away.
I'll meet you in
the main square in 20.
Go.
Pardon.
Pardon. Pardon.
Hey, guys, what are the odds?
Nasr! I need to
borrow your bike.
As long as it is to borrow,
not steal, ha?
Yes, of course. Come on,
quick. come on.
Okay... accelerator, brake.
Water. Very hot out there.
Ah, very thoughtful of you.
This is all pretty
straightforward, yeah?
Yes. Very straightforward
indeed. Yes, yes.
Just like riding a bike.
Okay, cool.
Sorry!
Well, this is nothing like
riding a bike at all.
Quick! Jump on.
Hold on tight!
Oh, shit!
Hold on, Pawny!
Wait for me!
Thanks!
I can't believe that
actually worked!
- H.
- Yeah?
Oh, right. Uh, glasses.
Hi, everyone. If you could
all look right here.
Just drive.
Oh, boy.
What do you think?
Press the red button?
I think it's hyperdrive.
No, no, no. I think
hyperdrive is blue.
Well, you know, sometimes
you have to trust your gut.
My gut, not yours.
Somebody press something.
Hoo-hoo!
Lost the tail!
What'd I tell you, huh?
Hyperdrive.
- Trust your gut. Trust your gut.
- Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Oh, God, I hate sand.
The red button was awesome!
Let's press the red button again.
Sshh.
Wow.
Hey, what's it doing?
Moving.
What is that thing?
See the core?
How it keeps emitting
convective energy
across the interior
of the photosphere?
Mm, yeah, no, I see all the...
I see the-the photosphere bit.
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, yeah, shh.
Those are thermonuclear
explosions.
Wait, and what does that mean?
Like-Like a bomb or something?
I think what we're looking at
is a supercompressed star
and by the color temperature,
I'd say it's a blue giant.
Let's just press the button, see
what-see what this thing does.
Are you suggesting that we try
a weaponized star for fun?
Mm-hmm. Well,
for science and fun.
Well, the two aren't
mutually exclusive.
Okay.
Yeah, there is no better
place than this, right?
They don't call it the
Empty Quarter for nothing.
Yes. That's why I made
the suggestion. Go.
Uh, at just .001,
what do you think?
Yeah, start off slow.
- Press the button.
- Okay.
Hmm.
Maybe ratchet it up
a few notches, the little...
Whoa!
That was the low setting?
Uh...
Do we think anyone's gonna notice
that-that wasn't there before?
Sir.
They, uh, got away.
I believe the
appropriate phrase is
you lost them.
Well, I put it to you, sir...
that they had help.
Probably.
But I know H.
Whatever he's doing,
there's a reason.
Why do you keep protecting him?
What is it going to take?
I'm protecting this institution.
From what, from me?
Are you questioning
my loyalty, sir?
At the very least, your judgment.
Is there anything else, Agent C?
- No, sir.
- Good.
Would you kindly leave?
Now, Vungus knew how powerful
that thing was, right?
He knew that it could
destroy entire worlds.
And he gave it to you. I don't
understand. Someone that he
only just met.
Why would he do that?
- I don't know.
- Hmm?
Maybe he trusted me.
I mean, not that I doubt your
general trustworthiness, but
I mean, I-I sang at
Vungus' mother's funeral.
Quite beautifully,
if I might add.
You know, w-we knew
everything about one another.
I mean, hey, I'm pretty sure
he trusted me.
Okay, H, if you must know...
He said that you'd changed.
You know, I-I'm getting a
little sick of hearing
people give me this
"you've changed" crap.
I'm the same person
I was years ago.
You mean to tell me that
you've always been this way?
What way?
Uh, vaguely inept.
Arrogant.
Reckless.
Did I miss anything?
Okay, yeah, hey, look.
I don't contend I'm reckless.
That's nice.
Well, maybe I am a few of
those things occasionally
but guess what? My job
is saving the planet
And that's what I do. I do
a pretty good job at it, okay?
And while that's still happening,
the rules are, there are no rules.
- Well, that's a rule.
- Mm-hmm.
Goddammit.
All right, nobody move!
Drop it, hairball!
Nobody move!
Bassam, how the hell'd
you get here?
Feelin' hydrated, H?
Never had a bath before.
Lost two pounds of dirt alone.
God, we drank from that.
Oh, God, I thought I tasted,
like, a living beard.
Okay, um...
Bassam, listen, all right, mate, uh...
Let's be sensible here.
I don't think you really know
what you're dealing with.
- So...
- Oh, no, I definitely do.
Which is why she's gonna
pay so much for it.
- Wait!
- No, no, no!
Have a nice life, bozos!
Great job, H.
Pawny, can you ask her to pass
me the torque wrench, please?
She has a name and a
title, and you know that.
My lady, the jackass
wants a torque wrench.
Pawny, will you tell him that
the sooner he restores
power to my drive console,
the sooner that I can figure
out how to program it?
My lady says that you're
a clock-brained ass clown
whose gullible idiocy has threatened
the very existence of the planet.
Okay, you know what, she-
she didn't say that, all right?
You little worst piece
in a chess board.
- She said it.
- She didn't say anything.
- Ow!
- Yeah, but I was thinking it.
Actually, every single word.
You make a really good point.
Thank you.
You should tell your lady
she now has power.
Uh, the jackass says, my lady,
that you have power.
Can you thank him?
Really?
But in a cold, kind of polite way.
You can even put a glare on it.
Just play around with it.
I trust you.
My lady says thank you.
Ugh.
I know where the weapon's
going and how to get it back.
My lady?
I got this one. I'm listening.
Bassam has only
one real buyer. Riza.
Stavros.
Riza, the Riza you went out with?
The intergalactic alien
arms dealer, Riza?
I'm gonna hop back
in for a second.
You dated Riza Stavros,
the Merchant of Death?
The Mother of Murder?
She's pretty hot.
I didn't know she was an
arms dealer when we met.
And I-And I was
distracted by her
feminine wiles and her
intoxicating beauty.
And besides, you know, we
weren't interested in labels,
we were interested
in our hearts,
and if having a big, old heart
is a crime, then shoot me.
Not yet.
You'll let me know though, right?
Really?
"A big, old heart"?
What?
That's funny, is it, hmm?
A big, old heart.
Stupid. Who talks like that?
A big, old doofus.
Totally.
You've never been
in love, have you?
I'm not making fun,
I'm genuinely asking.
You've never once abandoned
logic for passion?
Ugh, what is this, the sequel
to The Notebook?
I never saw it, but I assume it's
a lot of this type of nonsense.
No, I haven't.
Passion is unstable
and logic is constant.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
Physical attraction
is nothing more than
chemical reactions in your brain.
Can't trust them.
They're not real.
Well, isn't the whole universe
a chemical reaction?
Pretty sure I can trust that.
Feels pretty real.
That's actually kinda deep.
Well, that should do it.
Power her up.
Thank you.
Pawny?
- Not there.
- That's as far as I could jump.
Actually, I could jump higher, but
that would've been more awkward.
Okay, enough.
Here we go.
And look at that.
- Well done.
- Mm-hmm.
Now, I know Riza.
She may be the Merchant of Death.
But she does have one weakness.
You ready to be a
hero, little guy?
Pretty open to anything.
Good. 'Cause we're
going to Naples.
Oh, to Riza's fortified fortress
of for sure death?
Ugh.
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Can we do this another day?
I have another visitor.
- Oh, absolument.
- Yeah?
Thank you.
- Au revoir.
- Bye.
Luca! Did you miss me?
No.
H.
I know why you're here.
Why are you wearing
pink trousers?
So, how've you been?
It's been a while, eh?
The tough thing about breakups
is the friendships you lose.
Ah, we had some good times
though, didn't we?
Riza and I had
good times, I guess.
You just sort of lurked
in the background a bit.
Wonderful, isn't she?
I just love dumb,
beautiful creatures.
This is familiar, isn't it?
So...
MIB finally showed you
the door, eh?
Showed myself out, actually.
Oh.
Some horses are
born to roam free.
And others just get shot.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
And I brought you something.
And I know how
you like special pets
so, I brought you
a peace offering.
Meow, meow.
Bark, woof, etcetera, etcetera.
Oh, I like it.
He is...
cute in an ugly
sort of way, isn't he?
The last of his kind.
You always did know the way
to my heart, didn't you?
And you always knew how to make
mine beat that little bit faster.
Not a neuralyzer in the world
would make me forget that.
You know, I was
actually looking forward
to seeing my guns
tear you to pieces,
and then I saw that
perfect, little...
face of yours, and...
I had to know.
Know what?
- I want to know the truth.
- Mm-hmm.
Was this ever real?
Hmm? This?
You, me, was it?
This'll be good.
Was it?
I knew who you were
from the start.
My job was to
gain your trust and...
take you down when
the opportunity came.
That's the truth.
Uh, yeah, gotta turn my
earpiece off for this part.
God, shut up.
- What?
- No, I'm sorry...
It's what I say to my heart
when it's like a
voice inside my head.
Oh, I know.
I couldn't fake that.
Thank you.
That's okay.
No, but thank you for...
for giving me closure.
Well, we all need some-some
closure from time to time.
Get him out of here.
What, wait, no...
Wait a second.
I need some closure, too.
- H...
- What about my feelings?
Here's a little tip
for you, honey.
Next time you bring
a peace offering,
don't make it the same
day I come into possession
of the most powerful
weapon ever created.
This had nothing to do with that.
I didn't even know you had a weapon.
It's a totally separate thing,
it's a coincidence.
Total coincidence. I didn't
know she had a weapon.
Did you know she had a weapon?
Take him to the boat.
Okay, okay, okay.
Well, fellas, I think
that went pretty well.
Looks like we'll be seeing
a whole lot more of each other.
Okay, okay, okay.
Sebastian, darling?
How would you like to be able
to destroy entire solar systems
without leaving your home?
- Pawny?
- Yeah, I see it.
Oh, would you look at that?
Good to go, M.
Okay, Pawny, it's all on you now.
Okay, that kind of pressure
is not constructive.
It's very simple, darling.
Do you want it or not?
No, I only have one, Sebastian.
And I won't have that for long.
No, I'm gonna give
you five seconds.
Perfectly done.
Whoops.
I'm gonna call you back.
Oh, crap, oh, crap!
Well, look at your little legs!
You are so fast!
God, look at you run!
You're so fast.
Wait, I'm coming, I'm coming.
Now, you don't run away again.
Oh, hello.
Oh, and here I thought...
H worked alone.
Silly me.
Poor you.
It's been a steep
learning curve, yeah.
Oh, that.
That's a snubnose
cross SIG Annihilator.
Do you know what that
does to a human body?
It boils you from the inside out.
Cute.
Do you know what a Pawny does
to sadistic alien arms dealers?
No, honey, tell me what a "pawny" is.
I'm a Pawny, you psycho!
Looks like the tables have turned.
That was an incredible catch!
That felt good.
M.
Don't worry, don't worry.
It's all part of the plan.
Well, H, you always have been
rather delusional.
Peace offering.
Kill them.
Start with him and make it hurt.
No, you don't have to do this!
Put me down,
you Terrantian thug!
Wait, did you say Terrantian?
Yes.
Yes, my lady, he did.
They tend to be very single-minded
when it comes to killing.
Brains the size of a pistachio nut.
Sshh.
You're not helping.
The creature you saw was
an unlicensed Terrantian
from Andromeda II.
Terrantian?
I know a Terrantian.
I met one once.
I helped him.
Kavula Nachshulin.
What?
Kavula Nagsulin.
What she said.
How d'you know that?
Because he said it to me.
Molly?
Yes.
Molly?
Are you shitting me, really?
Who's delusional now?
It's you?
You've grown!
I mean, me-me too.
Give her the box.
Luca, you can't do this.
Haven't I been good to you?
I've let you kill
anyone you wanted.
Come on.
No?
The box?
Thank you.
You changed my life, by the way.
Hey, uh, quickly...
Kavula Nachshulin, what does it mean?
It means, one day, I'll kill
whoever I choose in the most
gruesome way imaginable.
Or maybe we just keep
her here for a moment
until he and I can discuss
our plan of action.
H? H, are you okay?
I'm good.
Uh, that was...
That was a rush.
Yeah, and incredibly painful.
Yeah.
Pretty sure the plan went
wrong in every conceivable way.
Yeah, well.
So, uh...
It's Molly, huh?
You're not supposed to know that.
Well, too late. I know it now.
Guess it's only fair
that you know mine.
- I don't wanna know yours.
- I'm gonna tell you.
- Okay.
- You ready?
Horatio.
- It is not.
- It's not.
It's Henry.
Yeah, you look like a Henry.
Good. It's all I've got.
I'm Steve.
Yeah? Steve? I thought you
said pawns didn't have names.
We don't.
I was just feeling left out.
Oh, Steve.
Whoa.
That is not cool.
I don't like what
the Earth is doing now.
Kavula Nachshulin!
It was worth a try.
We must have the weapon
for the Hive.
No! I don't know if you've heard.
That we are the Men in Black.
The Men and Women in Black.
Nice save.
If you think we're just
gonna hand this thing over,
you've got another thing coming.
You don't know who
you're dealing with.
See, we protect the Earth.
And that means everyone
and everything on it.
You wanna do this?
You wanna get down?
Fine. Let's go!
Move and I'll obliterate this
entire island and everything on it.
Uh, yeah, including us.
You don't think we should've
spoken about this before?
I just gave a whole speech.
Yeah, I really like the speech.
I just thought that maybe this
was gonna be more effective.
You heard me.
Don't make me use it.
We'll do anything
to protect our world.
So will we.
Nothing in this universe is unkillable.
With the proper voltage.
Are you both all right?
Uh, yes, sir. Never better.
Sir, how did you find us?
Experience.
Riza again, H?
When are you going to learn?
I knew I could count on you.
That in the end, you'll pull through.
Thank you, sir.
You too, M.
Agent O had a feeling about you
and she was right.
The universe has a way of leading
you to where you're supposed to be
The moment you're
supposed to be there.
Let's go home.
Let's keep this safe, shall we?
Sandra, inform
the Jababian embassy.
We have the weapon.
Quite a first assignment
for a probationary agent, M.
Marrakesh, the Empty Quarter.
Naples.
Imagine what you will accomplish
when you're one of us.
Yes, sir.
Enjoy this moment, M.
They never last.
I don't know how you do it,
but you just keep doing it.
Yeah? What's that, C?
Saving the world.
Total destruction, twice!
In as many years, I mean...
- What are the odds?
- What are the odds?
MIB!
Right.
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- How's it going?
- Uh, you know.
- Cool party, huh?
- Yeah, great party.
- Something is wrong.
- Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
I said to the Dyads, we'd do
anything to save our world.
- They said that they would, too.
- Mm-hmm.
Then they told us they needed
the weapon for the Hive.
What if we misunderstood
what that meant?
Maybe they needed the weapon
to use against the Hive
- to save their world.
- Mm-hmm.
Which could mean
they were never the Hive at all.
Uh-huh.
But the DNA, the mutations.
High T showed us that sample.
All right. Let's see.
Agent H. Bring up the
Dyad forensic report.
Who has the authority
to make a case file disappear?
Come with me.
And what about Naples?
How did they know we were there?
He was doing his job.
Does his job include tracking us?
He gave this to me as a gift.
It has a chip inside it.
We need to see the
confiscated Jababian weapon.
Not possible.
Not possible? I-I'm the
senior agent on the case.
Let's make it possible.
W-Where's the weapon?
I think he's been chasing it
the entire time.
High T is the mole.
He's gotta be.
A mole for who?
Where would he be taking it?
Paris.
My guess would be Paris.
I knew, you know, I knew
all along that something was off.
I thought he was covering for you.
But it turns out it was him.
He was hiding his own tracks.
Well, there's gotta
be an explanation.
- M, come on.
- I'm coming with you.
- No, C.
- Hey, hey.
Come on, now,
this isn't about you.
I know. I agree.
Listen, if it turns out
what you're saying is true,
and word gets out that T,
the most decorated agent
in MIB history is a traitor,
the agency will never recover.
If we stop him, no one
ever has to know.
But what if you can't stop him?
Then what?
Well, then tell them it was me.
Tell them I was the traitor.
Trust me,
the agency will believe you.
You.
Oh, that's right.
That happened.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
I'm driving.
That really should be here.
Not in this country.
There should be a
big red button around here.
Yes! Press the red button!
Found it.
H, you gotta see this.
A portal from Sector C
has been activated.
The Hive.
I'm sending you backup. Out.
You remember when I told you
we were in the lying business?
Mm-hmm.
That's what T said to me the
night he recruited me. He said,
"We have to lie to the world,
which means we could
never lie to each other."
I just don't believe that he has.
But you can't always
trust your gut, H.
Sometimes things are exactly
as they appear to be.
No, we saved the world,
for God's sakes.
Together with nothing but our wits
and our Series-7 De-Atomizers.
So I've heard.
- H?
- Yeah.
Would you mind telling
me one more time?
How'd you beat the Hive?
Uh, it was three years ago,
High T and I went up
to face the Hive
with nothing but our wits and
our Series-7 De-Atomizers.
Cool?
Yes, but how'd you do it?
W-What are you doing?
I'm just curious.
How'd you do it?
- I just told you.
- You didn't though.
I did, a few times. Okay, uh,
High T and I went up
to face the Hive
with nothing but our wits and
our Series-7 De-Atomizers...
Am I... I'm repeating myself, aren’t' I?
- Over and over.
- Word for word.
Yeah, well, um...
Okay, w-why would I be doing that?
H, I don't think that you
beat the Hive that night.
I think you were neuralyzed.
Ah.
You came to say goodbye.
And you brought the lovely M.
You can really feel the history here.
Eiffel discovering wormholes.
Gangways to other civilizations.
The First Alien Migration.
And we made history here, too,
didn't we, H?
With just our wits and
our Series-7 De-Atomizers.
No.
We didn't.
The Hive wanted the most
powerful weapon in the galaxy.
So you had Vungus bring it
to Men in Black.
You'd wait and when it came,
you'd give it to them.
My dear boy,
you were always
a bright one, but...
There's no stopping this.
With the weapon out of
the way, every planet will fall.
Starting with this one.
Step away from the controls!
You neuralyzed me.
Made me a hero.
The guy that saved the world.
Left alive to sell the lie.
They wanted this.
You were there.
You were always like a son to me.
H!
You were always like a son to me.
That's not High T anymore.
You were always like a son
to him.
Shoot it! Shoot it!
My Queen!
I'm coming!
What do we do? What do we do?!
I'm gonna get him back.
I know he's still in there somewhere.
Hey!
Hey, I know you're
in there somewhere!
It's me, H!
Remember.
You wanted me
to take your place.
M!
The truth of the universe.
I wanna know how it all works.
The universe has a way of leading
you to where you're supposed to be...
The moment you're
supposed to be there.
My Queen!
I'm not losing another queen.
You said I was
like a son to you!
You were like a father to me!
H.
Right time.
Right place.
Pawny?
Yeah?
You've served your queen well.
Thank you, my lady.
It was my honor.
So, is she as tough as they say?
In a word, yes.
- Well, you didn't screw up.
- No, ma'am.
Well, it's really, to be honest,
there were a few
bumps along the way.
A little friction on the start.
Let's not be honest.
Okay, we didn't not screw up.
You said there may be a problem
in London, but you knew.
I hadn't trusted London
branch for some time.
I never understood
the reason why.
T lived for this organization.
He was the very best
we had to offer.
He will be...
Missed.
Welcome to the circus, Agent M.
You are no longer probationary.
Well, there you go,
my work here is done.
You are.
I'm sorry, what?
Probationary.
Head of London branch.
I-I'm sorry, probationary head?
It sounds like I got promoted
and demoted at the same time.
No. Try and cope.
Several years ago, before all this,
T mentioned to me a young,
up-and-coming field
agent who had certain
leadership qualities,
shall we say?
Was his faith in you
misplaced?
No, I just think there are
far more experienced
agents than myself.
Oh, there are.
But you have the full
support of our senior staff
and, by the way, Agent C.
Is that right?
Do I take it you accept?
- Yes.
- Good.
I'll talk to the bosses upstairs.
You need to clear
your London desk
and report to MIB in
New York on Monday.
New York.
Thank you, Agent O.
Congratulations, probie.
Congratulations to you, too.
You'll want to brief your agents.
Walk with me.
So, you wanted to know
how it all works.
Now you do.
And as
you will, no doubt,
have divined, Agent M...
There's a price.
Hey there, what're you doing?
I told O I had to take care of a
couple things before I went back.
Yeah, like, what, stealing my car?
No, like, driving it.
Well, you're on the
right side, at least.
I'm a quick study.
Give me a lift back to London?
Road trip.
- Aah! Up, up, up, up!
- Oooh!
Oh, God, did not need that.
Hey, could you just zap me with
that forgetting thing, please?
What are you doing here, Pawny?
Get used to seeing me, pretty boy.
I'm your new babysitter.
- He's my new what?
- Babysitter.
Queen's orders.
She says the chance of your
sorry ass surviving without me:
- Zero.
- Okay, I did not say that.
Exactly.
She said it's slim to zero.
I rounded it down to zero,
'cause I feel like it's zero.
Consider it a parting gift.
Come on, I saved the world.
You couldn't tell 'cause you were
getting choked out on the floor.
Do I even have a choice?
No.
Yes! There we go.
All right,
where's that little red button?
Oh, it's right here.
Whooa!
I still don't like you.
Love that option.
Now, this is a very complicated
piece of machinery, okay?
So be careful.
Yeah, got it.
I'm gonna trust my gut.
