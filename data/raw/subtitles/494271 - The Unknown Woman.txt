Turn around.
Okay, out.
Turn around.
Giorgia stays,
Samantha and her friend can go.
Strip.
Turn around, slowly.
She'll do fine.
Thank you, dear, you can go.
This is vacant and furnished.
It was remodeled recently...
...but costs double the other,
and two months more advance.
Condominium costs are triple.
Best you know now,
when trucks pass, the place rattles.
You should take the other.
I'll take this.
May I help you?
- Good morning.
- Hi, Matteo.
Hello. Need maid?
- Where are you from?
- Ukraine.
- We don't need anyone.
- Ah.
- If you hear anything...
- Stop now and then and we'll see.
Many thanks.
Thanks.
What can you do?
Everything:
clean, cook, wash, doing...
- Doing ironing.
- Are you ill? Hungry?
No, just need work.
- If you help me, I'll give 20%.
- Who do you take me for?
Better, 30, alright?
I'll give you 30%.
What people these days!
Madame?
Come back through again.
- Sorry.
- Here you are.
Really love strawberries!
- A document, please.
- Yes.
- Give me your bag.
- Here.
- Irena Yaru...
- Yaroshenko, Irena Yaroshenko.
- This is okay.
- We're sorry, but we must...
What's this?
My savings.
- It goes off, don't know what to do.
- Must be broken.
Our apologies, Madame,
this can happen.
Nello, where are you going?
Are you thirsty?
I know you need a job,
if you're interested I'm leaving.
- Thanks, but I found one.
- Great!
- I can see for a friend.
- If you want.
- I just got my degree, I'll work
in a lawyer's office. - Congratulations!
You're lucky,
all jewelers here in Velarchi
don't usually take foreigners
into their homes.
Gina, would you do it
for that trifle?
Never! Besides
that stairway's a pigsty.
Okay, I get you!
Excellent job!
- When do I come?
- Tuesdays and Saturdays.
30 euros a day, 60 a week.
- So I give you 40 a week.
- Alright.
- What deposit to open the account?
- 8,000.
I heard you're looking for work.
My mother needs help.
Are you interested?
I have full week.
- I can see for a friend.
- Thank you.
Did you polish
the fourth floor doors and name plates?
I shouldn't?
It wasn't your job.
But since you work miracles,
you're forgiven.
Thank you and if you need me...
- Gina, Tea's out of vitamins.
- I know, I'll get some.
- Have a good day.
- Bye, Madame.
Stairs, stairs, stairs...
- The elevator works.
- Makes me feel panicky.
I can't breathe,
so stairs, stairs...
I live on staircases!
There's another small job.
An apartment's been painted,
needs cleaning, organizing.
- Where?
- Third floor, apt. 6.
- How much should I ask?
- More you ask, the better for us both.
Alright, so we'll see you on Monday.
Listen...
- Have a good meal.
- Thanks.
I can't stand her silence!
Only talks to her daughter,
she's a grouch with others.
How can she never talk?
- Must have problems.
- No shortage there.
- What does Mr. Donato do?
- They have a jeweler's lab.
He's director, she designs and engraves.
She's good, but no company.
If you like, we could go out.
I'm free only
Thursday afternoons and Sundays.
Why not?
Although I know nothing about you...
What's all that ruckus?
It's Valeria.
- Why not work in the outside lab?
- She's separated.
Not all who separate
set up labs in their homes!
Before too, what fighting!
There was peace only
when they went to the country.
She did her whole pregnancy there.
Hello?
Yeah... Me too...
I can't talk right now.
Can I call you back?
Talk to you later.
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief!
Thief!
Be right back.
37!
39!
May I help you?
40!
41!
- Actually I said 8mm.
- 42!
- 42! Where's 42?
- Me!
- Duplicates of all three
plus the remote. - Alright.
Make a copy of everything.
- Something wrong?
- No.
Meantime, can I pay?
- 60 euros...
- That man's first. - Sorry.
There.
- The short one is out.
I don't have this one. - Are you sure?
It's been ordered.
You'll get me fired.
Wait, maybe there's a way.
- Feeling ill?
- I'm better now.
I don't like
going to the movies alone.
- Why not go with the girl?
- She wants just cartoons!
Maybe she's too young.
She'll be 4 on Sunday.
If I give her a savings account?
- Bank accounts earn nothing.
- No, that's not the purpose.
Every month
I'll deposit what I can set aside...
...so when she's 18
she'll have a nest egg.
- Like some?
- Yes.
She'll know best
how to make the most of it.
Sorry, what a mess!
I'm sorry!
Don't worry...
That's a future day.
She'll have a nice sum.
Sounds like a good gift.
She'll like it.
Won't breathe a word, I swear!
You'll end up bad, believe me!
It's 3 years now you've been looking
and looking... What for?
Questions right and left...
You're sick!
Just look at that!
Madame, this is Matteo.
Nothing serious...
...you forgot to set the alarm.
Yes, all's okay.
It gave me a scare!
Yes, I'll set it.
Can a real dream exist
among so many nightmares?
I'm real! Feel me?
It's me, Nello,
flesh, bones, skin, nerves.
Nightmares can be forgotten.
Trust me, I'll take you away
from all that mess.
Rasaniza.
What?
- Kra-sa-vi-ca!
- Krasavica.
Maybe someday
I can forget my nightmares.
They're mine, it's easier,
but you?
Meaning? Talk plain.
Not enough money.
Now that I finished apt. 6,
you have to help me.
Be patient.
- Hello.
- Hi, Matteo.
How many jewelers
work in their homes here?
Except the third floor, all of them.
Don't they need someone to help
around the house...
...or substitute old housekeepers?
It's not easy
and for a foreigner it's even worse.
They all have trusted help.
- Morning!
- Morning!
Your friend Gina's been there forever,
she'll never be sent away.
Stairs, stairs, stairs, stairs...
Hello, Gina!
How did the party go?
Well, just like
every child's birthday:
...the more kids have fun,
the more adults think of old age.
Did she like the gift?
- Her mother was astonished.
- And the girl?
She didn't understand it.
Taken with her new toys...
But no matter,
one day she'll realize.
- She got another bump on the head.
- What?
She has a rare disease
inhibiting her defense mechanisms.
She's always bruised.
If something falls on her,
she doesn't protect herself.
If she falls,
she doesn't stop herself.
- There must be some cure.
- Doctors say there isn't.
She just has to be careful.
There's worse.
- I have to go now.
- See you later. - Bye.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Yes, she'll do fine.
You're Irena?
Yes.
- Sojourner's permit?
- All in order.
- 32... Are you married, children?
- Married, no children.
- Your husband?
- He works in Ukraine.
- Can you cook?
- Yes.
What, for example?
Cutlets, pasta with pesto,
spaghetti Bottarga style...
...fruit pies of all kinds.
- How strange.
- Don't you like pies?
- No, the contrary!
- Do you have experience
with small children? - Yes.
- Have you taken care of them often?
- Very often.
You sound perfect!
Gina and the porter
have spoken very highly of you.
Let's do a trial period,
then we'll see.
- When do you want me to start?
- Is Monday alright?
Perfect, thank you.
- Ah! One very important thing!
- Yes.
- Can you drive?
- Absolutely!
- Is this okay?
- Better.
- Now into second.
- Yes.
- Did we have to come here?
- Not a soul yesterday.
Turn at the roundabout.
Just go away!
Careful! Want an accident?
I like you! You and me
will do great things together.
So I want a stage name for you.
Something special.
Giorgia.
Giorgia,
like the song.
Giorgia, Giorgia.
Like it?
Untie me, even just one hand,
and I'll answer.
You've got great eyes.
Hello?
Hello?
Who is it? Hello?
This is the laundry room.
Sorry for the mess...
The washer leaks when it spin-dries.
I have to get it fixed.
There's a small problem
with the hood.
When you turn it on from here,
you have to hit it or it won't start.
- Where do I turn off the gas?
- Oh, yeah, sure...
For the first weeks...
...can you work on Thursdays too?
- Of course.
Do I change the sheets here
every week too?
No, this was Gina's room,
no one sleeps there now.
I work here.
For no reason whatever
you set foot in here...
...or touch anything in my absence.
- Even to wash the floor?
- Nothing at all. - Fine.
Slowly!
It's nothing, sweetie.
- You're bad!
- It wasn't on purpose. - I'm sorry.
It's nothing, sweetheart.
I didn't see her...
I never want to see her again,
dumbbell!
You got knocked up!
I told you to be careful.
You're all the same!
You said to excite him
even without...
You dirtied my shirt,
you'll pay for it!
The tangler does the untangling.
- Madame, excuse me.
- Come in.
The collar of this blouse
is ruined, what do I do?
What can you do? Throw it out.
Too bad, it looked nice on me.
I can turn it around.
- You can do that too?
- It's not hard.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Wait, let me finish
the link on this bracelet.
Irena, the new maid.
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening. Alright.
Daddy! Daddy!
- Did you bring me the castle?
- Forgive me, I forgot.
- Leave the room, please,
go to the child. - Immediately.
Tea, want a snack?
Tea?
I want to know why!
That's no way to talk!
It is!
I don't recognize anything here!
Lower your voice!
What, lower my voice? Whore!
- How dare you?
- How dare I?
I know you've got
your own friggin' stuff.
Oh, just stop it, please!
Hi, Tea!
Are you sorry to see me?
Mommy couldn't come.
Let's go.
You're right, I was a dumbbell.
How can I set things right?
- You tricked my mother.
- How?
You can't drive, I'll tell her.
Good, so you'll be rid of me...
...but it's not my fault
you don't know how to fall.
I'll tell her you peek
when she argues with your father...
...then you hide and cry.
- Hi, Mommy!
- Hello, sweetheart!
How are you?
How did it go?
- Fine.
- Good girl!
Now go with Irena...
...I'm doing urgent work.
See you later.
- Go look in your room.
- Why? - Go!
Wow! The princess castle!
- Thank you.
- Your father brought it.
Did you call Daddy?
Sure, I'm not like you
who never calls him.
Irena, the spin-dry!
- So now you can dial Daddy's number!
Good girl! - Yes.
Do you fancy going to the pool
for the swimming lessons?
Yeah, but I'd rather...
Hello?
One rag's not enough!
- Alright, it's all in order.
- Or there'll be a lake.
Did you get the pail?
- Did much water leak?
- None.
- Is this a miracle?
- I changed the rubber...
You're fantastic,
the end of a nightmare!
If that's all, I'll clean up
the kitchen and leave.
No, wait.
Your relationship
with Tea is better now.
Could you stay with her
until around midnight?
- Please go, I have no schedule.
- Good.
I know it was you.
- What?
- The present.
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought you'd be happier
to think it was from your father.
You changed hair color three times...
...black when you were born,
then red and, at one year, brown.
Your eyes, black, green, brown!
My goodness!
Know any lullabies?
- Lullabies... Yes, one.
- Sing it to me!
- Hiya! Hiya!
- Hello!
- You even organized the store room!
- I emptied it because it was flooded.
- It's all to throw out.
- Not my things!
Remember these?
- It's beautiful!
- It's unrecognizable.
How fantastic!
How did you do it in three days?
It's perfect!
Irena, the towels!
I washed everything,
there was no time.
It's chilly! Thanks.
My compliments, Madame.
May I say,
you have a young girl's body.
That's foolishness!
- Donato, you'll make her fall.
- Yes sir, Colonel!
I'm happy you and your husband...
Even Tea is much more relaxed.
Rub some cream on my back, please.
Thanks.
We're silly, I formalize with you
and you with me...
Why don't we simply stop it?
As you wish, Madame.
That wasn't a compliment earlier,
you do have a nice body.
Doesn't seem you've ever had a baby.
Tea, careful!
- Don't run like that!
- Don't terrorize her.
If she falls, she'll get up!
We're keeping her
from always getting hurt.
Leave her free to move.
Isn't there a cure?
She's not ill,
get it in your heads!
Tea...
Irena, what's your husband like?
- My husband?
- You never talk about him.
Daddy! Hi!
Drop me at the bus stop.
- We'll take you home.
- Don't bother.
So we can see where you live.
Another time, I'll just walk.
Bye-bye!
Oh, come on!
Irena, wait!
I'll come with you,
so we can talk.
- Something wrong?
- No, nothing.
It was really tough
convincing them to take you...
...many had better requisites.
I see, our deal's no good anymore?
No, I just thought
you might be a little nicer to me.
Let me help you.
Live around here?
Listen, Matteo:
...as of today I'll give you
50% of my salary. Alright?
But stay away from me.
Thanks.
I have something important to ask.
Are you up to staying
a week alone with Tea?
Before Christmas
I need some time alone.
- You owe me no explanations, alright.
- Good.
You'll have special payment,
of course.
I'll leave you an amount
for the food shopping.
For any other needs
call Mr. Donato at the lab.
- Alright.
- Wait a moment. - Yes.
- You can call me at any time.
- It'll be fine.
I'm worried about Tea,
never let her out of your sight.
Maybe it's better if she doesn't go
to school. What do you think?
I don't think so,
too many changes...
Is Friday the last day before vacation,
or Saturday? No, Friday.
Don't tell her anything,
she'll ask too many questions.
- One last thing...
- Yes?
It's been a long time
since I went to Villa Robinia.
I'll do it, you try to be happy.
- What did you do?
- Me? Nothing.
Here you are!
I didn't know where else to look.
- I told you I would come to class
for her. - She ran off.
I understand that,
it's the rest I don't understand!
They pushed me down the stairs.
If this happens again,
you'll be in serious trouble.
- Still hurt?
- Yes.
The next time you have to react,
beat them up.
What about the story
of the cheek?
If someone slaps you,
they can slap the other cheek too.
That's what the ones
who start the fights say.
You must defend yourself,
and protect yourself when you fall.
How?
- If you want to know, you must do
everything I say. - I accept.
Let's shake.
We should celebrate.
- I bet you like strawberries.
- You win!
I knew it.
The pediatrician says I can't eat them.
You won't tell my mother?
I'd betray our pact.
I keep secrets.
- Hurt you?
- No.
- Is this the game of salami?
- Sort of.
Get up.
I'll help you.
Good girl!
Up you go!
Come on.
By yourself!
Now alone.
Come on, up!
Come on, Tea! Get up!
Good girl. Get up.
- Good.
- I did it, now stop!
Get up by yourself!
Up you go!
- You're bad!
- By yourself!
Get up!
Again! Get up!
Come on, get up!
Come on, Tea! Come on!
- I'll tell my mother, I'll get you fired.
- Will you get me fired?
- Who'll you get fired?
- You're horrible!
You're bad!
- Again!
- You're bad!
Again! Again!
- Get up! Get up!
- Stop, please!
- Again!
- Stop it!
Get up, come on!
Again! Get up!
Whore! Whore! Whore!
Good girl!
See, you can do it?
Why didn't you slap me before?
Why didn't you do it before?
You're good, understand?
Come with me.
Tell Mrs. Adacher
she's one payment in arrears.
- I've just paid.
- Oh, sorry.
Here we are.
Here's the nicest guest
at Villa Robinia.
Gina, do you recognize me?
It's useless.
If it's not cold...
...she can go out for some air.
It'll do her good.
I'm sorry.
I know you'll never forgive me...
...but if I didn't go my way
I'd have died myself.
Understand?
I'll repay you somehow.
That's small for a large branch,
put it higher.
Sure, Madame President.
Put the star on top.
- Mr. Donato, staying for dinner?
- Well, Madame President?
It won't hurt you
to spend an evening with me.
- Want to eat with us?
- I don't think so.
- Daddy, you tell her too.
- Don't be a pest.
If I'm the president,
why do you always decide?
Irena, please...
Who taught you to cook so well?
No one, I've read lots of recipes.
- I'm still hungry!
- He's hungry!
