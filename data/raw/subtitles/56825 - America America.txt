My name is Elia Kazan.
I am a Greek by blood,
a Turk by birth...
and an American,
because my uncle made a journey.
This story was told me over the years
by the old people in my family.
They remember Anatolia, the great
central plateau of Turkey and Asia.
And they remember the mountain,
Erciyes, standing above the plain.
Anatolia was the ancient home
of Greek and Armenian people.
But 500 odd years ago, the land
was overrun by the Turks...
and from that day the Greeks
and Armenians lived here...
but as minorities.
The Greek subject people.
The Armenian subject people.
They wore the same clothes
as the Turks...
the fez and the sandal...
ate the same food,
suffered the heat together...
used the donkey for burdens.
And they looked up
to the same mountain...
but with different feelings...
for, in fact, they were conqueror...
and conquered.
The Turks had an army.
The Greeks and the Armenians
lived as best they could.
But the day came, here in Anatolia,
as everywhere there's oppression...
when people began to question.
There were bursts of violence,
sudden and reckless.
People began to wonder,
and some to search for another home.
You say in America they have
mountains bigger than this?
In America, everything's bigger.
What else? What else in America?
What are we waiting for?
Come on you, let's go you,
with the help of Jesus.
We better sell this ice
before it melts.
The year is 1896.
A Turkish provincial governor
has called...
an emergency meeting of his council.
Be seated,
be seated, please.
Your glasses, Governor.
This came an hour ago,
over the wire from the capital.
Your Excellency...
On this day, the eve of our
national feast of Bayram...
Armenian fanatics have
dared to set fire...
to the National Turkish Bank
in Constantinople.
It is the wish of our Sultan...
Abdul Hamid the Resplendent,
the shadow of God on earth...
that the Armenian subject people
throughout his empire...
be taught, once and for all,
that acts of terror...
cannot be tolerated.
Our Sultan has the patience
of the Prophet...
but he has now given signs
that he would be pleased...
if this lesson were impressed,
once and for all...
upon this dangerous minority.
How this is to be effected
will be left to Their Excellencies...
the governors of each province...
...and to the army post commanders
stationed in each provincial capital.
Stop!
Stop!
Help yourself, sir,
help yourself.
Jallal...
bring something.
Sir, Your Honour...
help yourself, sir,
help yourself.
That's what he needs,
encouragement.
But, Your Honour...
What do you want?
Not I, the ice,
it's nature is to melt.
It does not consider we have to go
all the way to the market to sell it.
In plain language,
you want me to hurry?
If you would.
All right now?
You had too much of a load
for this dear old horse.
Now, she'll get you to market
more quickly, agreed?
Yes, sir, agreed.
Are you Armenian?
Greek, sir, Greek.
Where do you live?
Over that hill.
And you?
Down below.
-And you are?
-Armenian.
Armenian?
Did he have anything to do with
burning the bank in Constantinople?
Why do you smile?
You are joking.
How could we have been there
yesterday? It's two weeks' journey.
Even with this horse?
Captain Mahmed.
-How do you know my name?
-We served together 8 years ago.
That is, I served you, and you
served your Sultan, Abdul Hamid...
the shadow of God on earth.
I was your orderly, so naturally
you've forgotten me.
Remember?
I stole chickens for you.
Vartan, you!
Vartan!
-I didn't recognise you.
-I know, but I'm Vartan.
Vartan, my little lamb,
what happened to you?
Well, as you can see,
I'm trying to make a few coppers.
With this dear, dying stud.
Hey, come on, Jallal,
put the ice back, quickly.
Hurry, before it melts.
Your people burn our buildings,
and you expect us to say thank you?
No.
Today, no Armenian
will be forgiven...
for being an Armenian.
I beg you, stay up here with me.
But he has his mother and father
down there and his little brother.
Then it is in the hands of God.
Vartan! Vartan!
Vartan!
-What's happened?
-They're in the church...
mother, father,
all our family, our people.
Father says come now.
I've got this ice to sell now.
Don't be seen with this Armenian,
Stavros, stay away from him.
I can't do that.
Your mother is looking for you.
Go home, quickly.
No one is on the streets.
I'm going to the Guitars.
What for?
For my satisfaction.
But the Turks drink there.
Here comes your mother.
Your father says don't work
with that man!
You're not a child anymore!
Why do I have to take you by the ear
like a child and drag you home?
Like a child!
Say something!
Answer me when I talk to you!
Stay away from that man!
He was with the Armenian again,
Isaac, your eldest.
You've given your father
a terrible day of worry.
Kiss his hand and ask forgiveness.
He's too easy with you.
You're too easy with him, Isaac,
if you'll forgive me.
It's not my place to say so, but...
Have you had dinner?
I'm not hungry.
Vasso, give him some food.
But, I'm not hungry.
You'll eat something.
Who is this Armenian?
Damadian's son, Vartan.
He doesn't know his place.
It's not our affair.
They're Armenians, we're Greeks,
our necks aren't the same.
True. They're saving the Greeks
for their next holiday.
-What did he say?
-We all heard what he said.
Where were you?
Father's been looking for you.
Just like a woman!
What's happening?
The jails are empty.
-Who are those two?
-I don't know.
The Armenian's going to dance.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
America...
America.
Let's go. If we don't go now,
we'll never get another chance.
Armenians.
To the church.
The captain says come now.
-It's beginning!
-All Turks!
Where is your captain?
Have pity on us.
Have pity on us!
Vartan, Vartan, Vartan,
they're inside!
Father, mother, everyone.
Do something!
Go back and tell them to
come out and beg for mercy.
Go!
Mama, Papa, open the door.
Mama, open the door.
Come on, come on, open,
open the door!
-Stavros! Stavros!
-No one leaves here.
-No one leaves this section.
-I'm taking him home.
Where's the Greek?
The Armenians started it.
It's always the Armenians.
Don't disturb us now, them first.
Every few years we have to teach
the Armenians.
The Greeks are more peaceful.
You see, the patient man waits.
As the Prophet said...
hatred exhausts itself.
It's no comfort for me that
the Armenians started this.
I believe that some day,
with Allah's help...
all races will live together
in peace, even the Armenians.
That's the hope of mankind.
They are bringing him, my friend,
they are bringing your boy.
See?
A fine young man.
Now, smile.
Smile.
I am very grateful to you.
It's not only that I like you,
I like all the Greek subject people.
We all know that.
I'm here only for the good
I can do.
I make nothing here,
you realise that.
And I do good.
I do help, don't you think?
Oh, yes.
We're all very grateful.
I was referring particularly to you,
you have a good business here...
the Turkish people like you,
and you have a good business.
We make a living.
Hold him there a moment.
I happen to know you do very well
and that makes me happy.
Very happy.
Come, my dear friend, join us.
Come, come.
Here, here.
To our friends everywhere.
Be grateful the governor
is my friend...
That's the way it is here!
Stavros!
Stavros!
Grandmother!
Grandmother!
Grandmother!
I came to see you, Grandmother.
You don't look well.
How's that good Greek, your father?
You know why the fox loves
the rabbit?
Because he hasn't any teeth.
How's your father?
Your grandfather was a man.
I was expecting you.
He told me you were coming.
Who?
Your grandfather.
He came he to see me last night.
I think he's found a new wife
in the land of the dead.
Well... What can you do?
But he still comes to see me.
What's the matter?
Nothing. Why?
You're moving around like a criminal.
What do you want?
I just came to see you.
You're lying. I hope to God you're
not going to be like your father.
Already you've got his smile.
What are you going to do?
All the men in our family lie.
The Turks spit in their face
and they say it's raining.
Be honest.
Tell me what you came for.
Don't lie again. Your grandfather
told me what you wanted.
What did he tell you I wanted?
Money. True?
True.
Why should I give you money?
What do you need it for?
You're an old woman.
Get out, you're just like
your father! Get out!
Don't do that.
Listen to me. You're my last hope,
do you know that?
You're going to listen to me.
I'm going away.
Good.
Far away.
The farther, the better.
To America,
I'm going to America.
Give me enough
to get to Constantinople.
There, I'll work and make the rest.
Hear me. You're my last hope.
Put me down.
Long ago...
you used to say to me
when I come of age...
you had something to give me.
I remember you as a little baby...
soft and round and made of butter.
And I remember you in a little blue
dress that your mother made you.
A little saint,
with a blessed, pale face.
And your eyes,
shining with God's own light.
My boy.
I thought, if only the whole world
were like that.
Here, take it.
It was your grandfather's.
I don't need this,
I need money.
You need this more,
take it.
It will remind you that no sheep
ever saved its neck by bleating.
I'll take it and put it
in the first soldier I meet.
Stavros! I'm an old woman,
you can't frighten me.
Where's your money?
I need money.
It is here, under my clothing.
You're not going to America,
you're your father's son.
Go home, be what you are.
Anything, anything...
help me.
Anything? Anything...
I'll remember you,
in America, I'll pray for you.
You?
You're going to America?
With the help of Jesus.
On foot?
However.
With nothing?
Each day, part of the distance.
How will you get there with those?
Take these.
Where do you come from?
Far away.
See those clouds? Behind
those clouds there are mountains.
The mountains of Armenia.
I shall never see them again.
I'll remember you.
Isaac!
Isaac, the family is eating.
Isaac, I've brought you some food.
I want you to eat something.
He did this once before,
stayed in there for nine days.
Isaac.
Isaac.
You're forgetting who you are.
If I want food, I'll call you.
I don't want to see you,
I want to see my son.
Stavros.
Stavros.
Where are your shoes?
What did you do with your shoes?
I've been waiting for you.
What? Where?
Where have you been?
Vasso, leave.
Yes, Isaac.
Remember,
you're talking to your father.
Come here, boy.
Sit close to me.
You look changed.
When I don't see you for a day,
you look changed.
Will you have a coffee?
No, thank you father.
You'll have a coffee with me.
Two coffees, immediately.
Immediately.
Look at your feet.
Make sure the shutters are closed.
The door!
Father...
I've made up my mind.
We're going to send you
to Constantinople.
What did you say, father?
Our family is going to leave
this place. You'll go first.
You will take everything
this family has of wealth.
You will.
I said everything
of wealth...
this family has.
Dig.
Dig.
This winter, I'll come here at night
and we'll weave together.
By the day of your wedding, you'll
have all the blankets you need.
From time to time,
I've had to do things that...
We live by the mercy
of the Turk.
But, Stavros, I've always kept
my honour safe inside me.
Safe, inside me.
And see, we're still living.
After a time,
you don't feel the shame.
Dig.
Lace collars? What will you
do with them, dearie?
Make yourself pretty?
It's too late, little dearie.
Yesterday, I got this from
our cousin in Constantinople.
I'll be honoured. Let Stavros
bring money for my business...
and I'll make him my partner.
He has a prospering establishment,
a prospering establishment.
Will it really be better for us
in Constantinople?
Yes, it will be.
Where else can we go?
It's our last hope.
You'll take our smoked meat.
You'll take the two big rugs
on the floor upstairs.
In fact, everything you can sell.
Our donkey,
you'll take our donkey...
and sell him when you get
to Constantinople.
The jewellery...
The jewellery which
came with Vasso...
when I took her for a wife.
This was my mother's.
See? She's wearing it there,
look.
I was going to give it to you
when you got married.
It's better this way, mother.
In time,
you'll bring your three sisters...
Are the shutters closed?
You'll bring your three sisters
to Constantinople.
As the eldest, your responsibility
is to see they marry well.
Then, as your business prospers...
you'll bring your four brothers
out to your side.
As the eldest, your responsibility
is to set them up in business.
Then it will be your mother's turn.
It is your responsibility to make
her final days happy ones.
Don't ask too much.
Vasso, there's a right way
and a wrong way.
Yes, Isaac.
We commit our eldest son
to your care.
Watch over him,
he is our hope.
Mother.
He's trusting you with everything...
Vasso!
Forgive me, Isaac.
Teach him that the meek
shall inherit the earth.
Except here.
Each and all men are brothers.
Trust no one.
A gentle word and a Christian smile
will turn away all wrong.
He's given you his coat.
I've sewed the money into the lining.
Feel it? Here.
And in this little sack, jewellery,
feel it?
Keep this coat on at all times.
Even when you're asleep.
Sleep with one eye open.
Vasso, be silent!
Vasso...
Vasso, what is it?
My dear God...
If you send him to the baker's
to bring bread...
you're never sure
he'll come back.
And now, Constantinople,
with everything we have.
Look at him.
Look at him.
Vasso...
if you and I...
have so brought up our eldest son...
that he could fail his family
at this time...
then we deserve to go down.
Mother...
I won't fail you, Mother.
Come on, now.
What are you doing?
I can't swim!
Be careful, the donkey,
you'll knock him in!
What are you doing?
I'll give you whatever you want.
I can't swim!
I'll give you more money.
God will punish you.
God knows my problems.
Be grateful I'm not looking
what's on the donkey's back.
Thief! Catch him!
Catch him! Thief!
Thief! Thief! Thief!
Catch him! Catch him!
How will I ever thank you?
It is I who am fortunate.
I, only I, brother.
This road to Ankara...
is the home of every mother-selling
bandit bastard in Turkey.
What good fortune is mine
to meet a brother on the road!
I beg you, it is my good fortune,
not yours.
What a sweet smile you have.
You and I, brothers?
Anything I have, is yours.
Just as I know everything
you have is mine.
Brother!
Brother, my heart aches,
when I see this poor animal...
struggling with this load
on his back.
I'm sure that at this very moment,
Allah is saying to himself...
"When will that man,
who is always smiling...
finally become aware of the pain
he is causing this poor beast?"
Do you think that is possible?
No...
Yes, I mean...
Then we must insist that my animal
share the load...
I insist. After all,
smoked meat is heavy.
So? So, as we are brothers
of the road...
our animals must be brothers
as well. Come on, help me.
Get down, get down.
Mukur.
Brother, I know this town well.
I've been a helpless victim of many
a bandit in the town of Mukur.
We'll camp here, on this hillside.
What will we do for food?
Delicious. Delicious meat.
Here, brother, eat.
Food is strength. We've 9 or 10
days' journey to Ankara.
They say the Prophet
walked barefoot...
but it must've been
over different roads.
I can go no further.
I thought these shoes
would last...
but I expected to ride. I wasn't
prepared for all this walking.
See?
What do you think?
I beg you, consider...
my brother sold a side of delicious
meat his family entrusted to him.
This is my price.
Brother, I did my best.
How are the shoes?
They pinch.
My feet are covered in boils
and sores.
Perhaps you could rest
in the next town.
And you?
I'll go on.
Oh, no, brother,
I could never leave you.
Why?
Never, never.
No, I would never leave you,
I could never abandon my brother...
but I must have one drink.
Brother, my soul is thirsty,
my heart is dry...
surely you would not deny me
one miserable drink.
I confess I can't pay for this one.
You didn't pay for the others.
It was unnecessary for you to remind
me that I am less fortunate than you.
After all, in friendship,
there is only one rule.
What's mine, is yours
and what's yours, is mine.
You have nothing.
As the Prophet said,
"Who can place a price on wisdom?"
Despite the Prophet,
this is the last I pay for.
You wish you'd never met me.
For some reason you cannot speak
what is obvious.
I had hoped my brother would be
for the entire journey.
Only last week, a man was murdered
between here and Ankara...
not far from this town
on the road to Ankara.
Behold...
Allah weeps for me.
Allah weeps for me!
Allah!
Allah, here I am!
Abandoned, without friends...
alone, without shelter!
Abdul, come on, Abdul!
All of you, go on.
No money, no roof.
Get out in the rain.
Go ahead.
You can't stay here. You chickens,
where do you think you're going?
That boy has plenty of money.
Brother, I've decided
not to leave you.
You don't seem
as happy as I am.
Where's that famous smile?
Smile!
I confess, I sold the meat,
but I did it for you, I swear.
They say a rope drawn too taut
will snap.
Now, look.
Look what I've brought you.
Chingana.
Chingana is for you.
I don't know the other's name, but
we'll find out all about her soon.
Join us, come, come!
The bear has a nose for females!
Here, give me that chair.
There's a Greek, attacking
without warning!
Thank you.
I forgive him everything.
Brother.
I brought up everything
out of the rain, brother!
What happened?
What, brother? They're all here,
every beautiful item.
Oh, my God.
What have you done?
Look, look!
Oh, my God.
They're all here.
Every single item.
Where are my sister's blankets?
While you were asleep, this woman
has given me unspeakable pleasure.
My sister's blankets.
Where is my coat?
You're wearing it, brother.
Look, here.
Oh, my God.
I know she must look
like a beast.
I'll admit that when one is older
one's tastes are easily satisfied...
but do not go by her appearance,
take her into the other room.
Penetrate to her soul,
go on!
My mother's rug!
I have never met a more generous
and brotherly person than you.
This trip is a landmark
in my life.
You're my brother.
Where is my mother's rug?
I beg you,
don't use that tone of voice.
Never mind my tone of voice,
where is my mother's rug?
You animal!
You animal,
where is my mother's rug?
I gave it to him.
To him? You gave my rug to him?
What for? What for?
To pay for your night's lodging
that's what for.
You can pay for your room
in money. Cash!
Give me my sister's blankets!
It is a rag. I was ashamed
to have my friends see it...
so I put it on the floor of
the toilet. Give me the cash.
I beg your forgiveness,
I cannot live without it.
Before all this company,
I beg your forgiveness.
Brother, don't leave me on my knees,
don't insult my soul.
Brother, I have never before
been on my knees to a Greek.
With a Turk you can either be
a brother or the opposite.
I warn you.
Brother.
Brother.
Brother.
Too bad.
Too bad.
That's the thief, take him.
Fortunately, Your Honour,
I've made an exact list...
of every particular this man stole
from me in the darkest hour.
Lies, lies!
Your Honour,
he insults your court.
"One carpet, the colour of roses
and the blue of midnight."
Behold, Your Honour.
As described.
A beautiful piece.
"One blanket,
the colour of peaches..."
-Make him take my coat off.
-Take off the coat.
I had a terrible time
after you left.
Those policemen
and that judge...
offered to divide my new
possessions with me.
When I declined,
they all helped themselves.
The judge particularly
wanted the rug.
The law in this country
needs considerable reform.
Look, I'll show you
what I have left.
Nothing, you see?
Nothing.
There are some coins missing.
About six of them,
by my estimates.
I came to the conclusion
that you'd swallowed them.
No?
I saw you do so in court.
At the time, I thought to myself
"Let him have something, poor thing."
But the situation has changed.
I cannot be so generous.
I'll admit that you've been patient.
If I'd been you, I'd have
taken out that blade...
and put it to its proper use,
but we Turks are primitive...
while you Greeks are civilised.
I envy you. You've learned
how to bear misfortune...
swallow insult and indignity
and still smile. I truly envy you.
Well? Is there anything?
Anything moving?
Nothing yet?
How long do you suppose?
Only Allah know that, eh?
Drink?
You're really such a coward.
I've killed men like you before,
it's like killing a sheep.
One clean cut almost anywhere
and the life flows out.
A twitch or two,
and it's over.
A drink?
No, of course, you don't drink.
You don't fight.
You have no use for women.
What kind of a man are you?
I can't waste any more time
on you.
I'll have to take those coins.
Unfortunately, I have no weapon.
I'll have to borrow your knife.
Yes?
No?
What? Why don't you say something?
Are you afraid to talk?
Do you value your life?
Say.
I don't know what you people are.
Are you like sheep? They won't
fight for their lives either.
Well...
it's the hour of prayer.
I'll give you a few minutes.
Allah!
Great by name,
great is thy greatness.
There is no deity, but thee.
I seek refuge near you, Allah.
Suchut! Suchut!
Suchut!
Constantinople train!
Constantinople train!
Constantinople.
That's all I have.
Constantinople train!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
America, hey America!
Hey, America!
Is she an American lady?
No, really, thank you.
You won't find a piece like this...
Where is this street?
What do you want?
Can't you see I have customers?
-How's business?
-No business.
Is this the establishment
of Topouzoglou?
Yes. What do you want?
We want nothing.
I'm his cousin.
When will he wake up?
When business comes.
You brought dirt in,
I'll have to sweep again.
I just swept it, just now,
five minutes ago.
Topouzoglou, this man says
he's your cousin.
Welcome, welcome.
What happened to you?
I had a bad dream.
My treasure.
Eat, eat, that's it.
You eat the head?
Good for the brain!
So you see, I have many customers.
What I need is more stock.
The rugs I sell...
What is it?
Forgive me.
I was merely going to say that...
You don't...
seem to be selling
what you have.
You are very sharp.
I do not have the proper goods
for the market as it is today.
What I will do,
after you know the business...
is take the money you've brought
and go to Persia...
and buy the kind of goods...
What's the matter?
Why did you eat my lunch?
I was hungry.
Go, out of my sight!
No, don't go, please, sit down.
For God's sake, give me a chance
to swallow this.
Here, ruination, sweep.
Come in, come in.
Well, I will write to your father.
He's a good man, if in time...
No! No! Listen, no.
He must never know what happened.
Promise. Not a word.
I only meant to say that in time...
It would kill him.
He put everything in me.
Everything?
Everything.
It will kill him.
I'm going to make it up to him.
I have big plans.
They're going to be proud of me.
But now, now nothing.
Not a word, promise?
Not a word.
All right, I promise.
Go on, sweep.
I have big plans.
My ruination.
Look how the rich come to work off
their lunch in their cars, while...
Stavros, listen.
There goes Aleko Sinnikoglou,
a man with lots of money...
and four daughters,
each plainer than the other.
So much, every day
he more and more loses the hope...
of becoming a grandfather,
do you understand?
God solves all problems.
You must not forget that you
are a young man, handsome...
and if properly dressed...
Do you understand me now?
Never mind, sweep.
Tomorrow, I'll arrange the meeting,
you'll see.
I'll dress you in a nice
blue suit and...
What? What are you doing?
You barbarian!
-What about the tariff for carriage?
-No, we'll ignore that.
I see. Well, this was...
What do I need to go to America?
Money.
First class accommodation.
How much?
Third class, 110 Turkish pounds.
I'll do it right away.
Is he American?
From Berkeley.
Do you give these men something?
No, we do it the right way.
I'll be back.
What did he say?
"At any rate, he didn't bring
a single penny, says he was robbed.
I tried to talk to him,
as is my place and duty...
but suddenly he threw
down a broom...
and ran out of the store,
his eyes on fire."
Now, listen.
"Beloved father, I went, as you
asked, directly to our cousin...
but I couldn't trust him.
No one ever comes into his store.
He sleeps all day on a pile of rugs
so I told him I was robbed.
I left.
Now I have a new plan.
Keep it up!
Hang on.
Wind the rope tight.
Wind the rope further.
Go on, hamal!
-Doesn't your friend eat?
-What's the matter, you sick?
You, hamal,
don't you get hungry?
Learn to spend the coins.
What are you saving it for?
"Beloved father"...
Mama, mama.
"I know Mother is worried."
We have a letter,
close the shutters.
"But, there's no cause to be.
My health is good...
and my appetite is very good,
very good."
This isn't garbage,
it's from the Sultan's table...
what he doesn't eat.
"One way or another,
I get what I need to eat.
So don't worry, one day,
you'll be proud of your son.
Remember, I have big plans.
Big plans.
That day will come, I promise you.
You'll be proud of me."
I'm cold, I need a woman tonight.
You want to come?
I'll pay for it. You need it.
I need nothing.
Did you ever have one?
Don't you want one?
My father wouldn't approve.
Father? Approve!
Where are you going?
I have another job.
Now? Another job?
Tonight?
Kill yourself with this,
it's easier.
Take it easy.
Hold it, hold it!
It's time, they're out
there working!
How much for a ticket?
What?
How much for a ticket?
110 pounds.
And you've saved by now?
What do you care?
How much?
Four pounds.
Four pounds? Now, tell me,
how long do you expect to live?
Longer than you!
That load is for an animal!
Get an animal!
Hey, hamal...
you.
America, America, you!
Don't take it, don't take it.
Come on!
What time is it?
You've got time.
I can't stay awake,
I keep falling asleep.
Don't worry, you'll be dead soon.
What's the baby weigh now?
How much?
Seven pounds.
Small money.
There's two kinds of money,
small and big money.
Small money is a whore,
you look at her coins...
she's been in everyone's hands
you wake in the morning, she's gone.
Then there's big money,
like you need.
You're going to America.
What you need is big money.
You like that?
Behold, you're human!
That's all there is, women.
Now then, big money.
Big money is fertile, it procreates.
How, I don't know.
But it reproduces, every time
you look, there's more.
But there's only two ways
men like us can get big money.
Steal it,
or if you're young...
marry it.
You can't get it by work.
Study me.
I worked like an animal...
from the first day I could
walk and carry. So?
Behold, the lowest form of life.
Now, if I were you...
there are very many very ugly girls
with rich fathers.
Let's get ourselves a couple
of those little mousetraps.
Come on, boy, you need it.
I need nothing.
You need it.
Afterwards, you come to my place,
I have one there for you.
Something nice.
I have...
I have never been with...
I don't know exactly
what to do.
They show you all that.
America, America!
America, America!
Hey, Abdul...
Come on, come on.
What happened?
My money! Where's the girl?
I've got to find her.
I've got to find her!
Nine months, nine months work!
Get out of here!
Come here, you!
-Who did you give his money to?
-The owner, downstairs.
The owner?
Please don't hurt me. He was
going to put me out on the street.
-Please!
-Come on.
Do you want me out on the street?
What am I without
a room and a bed?
I'm an animal without
a bed and a room!
If you go to whores,
you must expect to be robbed.
Three months she didn't pay.
She says next week.
Three months she didn't pay.
Coffee?
We're enjoying ourselves here.
Get out.
Get out, before I get angry.
Get out, now!
If you were mighty you could've
put together 110 pounds...
the way you did the seven.
That way you have to have strength.
What's the use of this? Tell me that.
What's the benefit of this crying?
You want to kill her? Why not
go kill her? lt'll do you good.
It's time you grew up
and saw the truth.
"Big things! Big things!
They're gonna be proud of me."
"They're gonna be proud of me,
some day they'll be proud."
You're nothing now
and you never will be!
I am, I am, I will be!
I'm leaving.
There is a better place.
It's all the same.
Since you left home, have you
met one follower of Christ?
Have you met one human being?
You.
Me?
Look at my face, you don't know me.
You don't know what I am.
You don't know who I am.
I have one idea for this world.
Destroy it and start over again.
-Who's that?
-He's with us.
There's too much dirt.
It calls for fire,
it needs a flood.
I don't know where
to look further, dear cousin.
He has disappeared from the face
of this black world.
The chiefs of the Turkish Empire
are the people themselves.
Turkey will be a great nation.
After I'm dead, I'm not interested.
He still thinks there's a clean life
somewhere. America!
Look who's going to America.
America?
Don't tell me about America.
-I was there.
-Tell him.
I built one of their buildings.
I fell and then no one wanted me.
If you have money in America,
you're somebody.
If you have no money,
it's just like here.
Life is for the rich.
Anyone who wants to go,
go now.
Again, after the explosions,
we separate.
We meet one month from today.
On the streets, we don't acknowledge
each other. Is that clear?
Look at him, a boy,
all he wanted was something.
What? Freedom? What?
-Do you know when a man is dead?
-I can tell when a mule is dead.
It's the same, but this is a matter
of hours. Throw him on the wagon.
-I'm off duty.
-Go on, throw him in. It's finished.
