If you get a chance, get over to Marin.
Check out the Marin County
Arts Fair. It's amazing.
It will be going on through
this Thanksgiving weekend.
Well, nothing's changed.
We've got fog and low clouds...
in both the East Bay
and here in San Francisco.
And we're lookin'at a high of
68 degrees once these clouds burn off.
The time now is twenty-three
after 7... 00.
Oh, my gosh.
Stick with your girl.
We'll be coming at you with more music.
Hello!
...I don't know you...
...Don't know those
melancholy eyes I see...
Yoo-hoo!
Tommy, turn it off.
We gotta make a baby.
Yeah?
I can't do that now.
'Cause I got a drainage issue
with a floor in Paris that...
- We have an issue that needs
to be resolved first.
- Needs to be resolved first.
- Right now?
- It's red.
Okay, I'll talk to you later.
- I thought you had a sentence hearing.
- I do, so we have to hurry.
We've got seven minutes for us.
Fifteen minutes for resting
with my hips elevated.
And I'll only be four minutes late
if I check my messages in the car...
- And there's no traffic on the bridge.
- Okay.
How about ten minutes for us
and twelve minutes for hip elevation?
- Nine and thirteen.
- Okay, deal. Come here.
No. No, no, wait. It's actually supposed
to work better if you're on top.
Okay.
I thought I'd never hear you say that.
So nice.
...The pressures of being
a man is hard...
...Don't think
I don't understand... . .
I know what they said,
reduced sentence, but I think
I can get a new trial.
Claire, I don't know if
we should bite off that much.
It's a first offense.
We can ask for leniency.
The jury forewoman is an
advocate. She's not an impartial juror.
I'd hate to push. This is a rape
case. I don't wanna piss the judge off.
Trust me on this, Alex.
Tell me you're joking.
Tell me you're joking.
Your Honor, my client is
looking at serious time in jail
and irreparable damage...
- While these guys are laughing
all the way to CNN.
- That's ridiculous.
Your Honor, juror number
nine is a rape victim.
And very much to her credit,
she's a major fund-raiser
for a sexual assault hot line.
I point out that the prosecution
should have submitted
those facts at the voir dire.
- The prosecutorial misconduct
does not stop there.
- Really? How do you figure that?
This very D.A. 's office handled juror
number nine's case eight years ago,
and I find it impossible
to believe...
- That no one on their team
recognized her.
- This is outrageous.
Ms. Kubik,
do you feel that justice was served?
We're very pleased that Gary Norris
will be receiving a new trial.
His victim might say she's been raped
all over again. This time by the system.
My heart goes out to her. But when the
rights of any defendant are violated,
we are all at risk
until injustice is redressed.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
Good job.
I need to talk to you.
Good! I need gossip.
- That was luck, Kubik.
- Ooh, just like your Bruins
last night. Sorry.
- She scores again.
- The heart of American democracy
beats on.
- Would you punch up my calendar, please?
- Personal or business?
Both. Thanks.
- Hi, big guy.
- Good work, Claire. We're proud of you.
Thank you very much.
I guess I'll type "partner"
in right here next toJanuary 1 st.
I didn't know
you were clairvoyant.
Really?
Are you serious?
- We'll see.
- Yes!
Not bad. I think that was just lucky.
- Bring it on, girl.
- Pretty.
- Pretty nice.
- Pretty lucky.
- Well...
- I'm taking you to pool school.
I don't think you have
a shot.
Thirteen ball off the five
in the corner pocket.
- Not in this lifetime, pal.
- Oh, yes.
Okay.
That is not fair.
That is not fair!
You can't hold...
You can't use your left hand now.
You're a mutant.
Hey, guys, look!
This was the scene in City Hall
earlier today.
Ms. Kubik, do you feel
that justice was served?
We're very pleased that Gary Norris
will be receiving...
His victim might
say she's been raped all over again.
- You look great! Look at you!
- When the rights of
any defendant are violated,
we are all at risk until
injustice is redressed.
- About the family...
- Wow.
I just want one.
- Honey, lock the door.
- Huh?
Someone's in the house.
Leave!
- Hurry!
- Wait up!
Damn kids.
It's okay, honey.
- 225 Dover. Send somebody right away.
- They're gone.
Are you okay?
Oh, God.
I'm fine.
Uh-oh, cute baby alert.
Hi. Can we meet
your baby? Hi!
What a doll.
He's in a pretty good mood.
...Have yourself
a merry little Christmas...
- ...Make the Yuletide gay...
...From now on our troubles
will be miles away...
There's this, uh, well...
Doesn't he have on a T-shirt?
The T-shirt was just
a huge hit afterwards.
Men all across America
were buying T-shirts.
I always liked
It's a Wonderful Life.
- Nice. Christmas domestic.
Yeah, that's the spirit.
Interesting.
Real interesting.
Keys please.
What is it, baby?
- F.B.I.!
- Get down!
- Get down, honey.
- What?
- Get down!
Get down
on the ground now!
- Get him!
- Get down!
- Leave her alone!
- You cuffed him?
You cuffed him?
- I cuffed him, yeah.
Screwed up the whole thing.
You know you're looking
at a multimillion dollar
lawsuit, right, Mr. Mulkins.
Excess use of force, harassment,
reckless endangerment.
- How's that for starters?
- It is " Mullins," Mrs. Kubik.
Special Agent Mullins.
You have a warrant for the arrest
of someone named Ron Chapman.
My husband is Tom Kubik.
Your computer is obviously
having a psychotic break.
It wasn't our computer.
It wasn't our computer.
If your people had gotten
any closer, you would have
burned the guy, all right?
Fine. Forget about it.
It wasn't our computer.
It was Marin P.D.
They ran the fingerprints after
your house was burglarized.
I'll tell you something else.
The A.F.I.S. flagged your husband's.
They've been in the system for 1 2 years.
Once again, what
is he being accused of?
- I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.
- Oh, come on!
You know that having been
subject to arrest, I have
the right to know the charges.
No, you don't. Not when it's
a military court, and not when
national security is involved.
Military court?
Hello?
Thank God I caught you.
I was freaked out that you
were gonna be out of town.
And I caught you on the news.
Claire, you have to stop letting
them mess with your hair.
- Jackie?
- I just need some money. I hate to ask...
Well, not really, but can you
just help me out? Please?
My landlord's breathing down
my neck as we speak. If you
say no, I'm gonna be evicted.
Can you come get me?
I know what it could be.
Maybe what it is is that
he did something that
he doesn't even know he did.
- And so he's in like witness protection.
- That's enough, Jackie.
Just stop it please.
Sorry.
Next time you need help,
call your other sister. Oh, wait.
- You don't have another sister.
- I didn't call you, Jackie.
You called me.
And I came to pick you up
and it's the first time you've
tried to see me in months...
by the way.
The base is
in San Lazaro. It's 45 minutes
south of L.A. on the coast.
I booked you a flight into
John Wayne Airport in Orange County.
- Okay, with luggage?
- Luggage, rental car.
You should be on the base
between 1 1... 00, 1 1... 30.
Good afternoon, ma'am.
May I see your I.D. please?
All right.
Mrs. Kubik?
James Hernandez.
Ron and I were in the same unit. This
must be a terrible shock to you, ma'am.
- But if there's anything I can do.
- Anderson.
Atchison.
Chapman. Green.
Ron was a good marine.
Now, I won't keep you. Good luck.
- Thank you.
- End of the hall, ma'am.
Room " B," ma'am.
What the...
- Where the hell are his clothes?
- Suicide watch, ma'am.
- I want clothes put on him!
- You'd have to file that request
with the brig command.
Is your name Ron Chapman?
Yes.
How...
l... I don't know what to say.
I had no choice.
I had no...
I had no choice.
They were accusing me of something
that I didn't do. Please believe me.
Believe you?
Well, I believed that, um...
- You were raised in a foster home.
- I was.
- That you were never married.
- Claire.
That you don't have
any children.
That you love me... Ron.
Tom.
Whatever your name is.
Oh.
I do love you.
But I did not do this.
Okay?
I swear...
that I never did this.
I swear...
that I never did this.
And I didn't want to tell you...
'cause I didn't want you
to leave me.
What happened?
My lawyer's here.
Mrs. Kubik?
Sorry to interrupt.
First Lieutenant Embry. Terrence.
Hi.
Um, I'm older than I look.
So...
Well, I'll let you two...
I'll wait in the...
Claire.
Just let me go talk
to him, okay?
- First Lieutenant,
is that what I call you?
- Lieutenant.
Why the hell haven't you filed
a request to get him out of
those chains and into clothes?
Right, yeah.
I'll take care of it.
I'm an attorney. May I please see
the charging document?
We call it a charge sheet.
Fabulous. May I see it?
Can you give me the basics?
Article 85, desertion.
Article 90, assaulting
or willfully disobeying
a superior commissioned officer.
Murder?
Nine...
Yes, if convicted,
he'll get the death penalty.
Shi...
Who's prosecuting?
Major Lucas Waldron has been
detailed as trial counsel.
- He any good?
- The best.
How 'bout you?
I do okay.
Have you ever won a case?
No.
I'm going to defend you.
I know you didn't kill nine people.
- Mrs. Kubik...
- I don't want you involved in this.
- I'm already involved.
- You don't understand.
Military law is not the same.
I'll learn.
We're gonna fight 'em, okay? Together.
You remember
those three American kids?
The students who were killed in
that cafe in El Salvador, back in '88?
There was a little town
called Monte Azul.
A member of a rebel group threw
a satchel bomb into that cafe.
- Press had a field day.
- Right. Everybody went nuts.
So they call up my unit,
Detachment 27,
to locate the rebel leader
who was responsible.
He was a terrorist
by the name of Danilo Chacon.
- And your orders came from?
- Our C.O. at Camp Lejeune. Bill Marks.
- Anyways...
- Wait. I'm sorry.
Brigadier General Marks?
Special Representative to the
Joint Congressional Committee...
on Military Appropriations,
Bill Marks?
Yes. He was Colonel
Bill Marks back then.
Under his orders,
we were sent into a little
village called Las Colinas.
It's not even a village, even.
Just some fields, a few huts.
Danilo Chacon was supposed
to be hiding out there.
And...
It was supposed to be routine.
Um, but somebody lost it.
- I hear gunfire.
By the time I get
to the other end of the village,
nine people are slaughtered,
and uh... goddamn.
l... I'm just standing there.
Old women,
men, kids, just dead.
And I lost it. L, uh, I jumped
the guy who did it.
And next thing I know,
I'm looking at first degree, nine specs.
- Who did it?
- Hernandez.
Jimmy Hernandez.
He ordered me to keep my mouth shut.
Said he was teaching them a lesson,
that Marks would back him up 1 00%.
- I told him to go to hell.
- Major Hernandez?
- Mark's top aide?
- Yes.
Um, he introduced himself
to me yesterday in the waiting area.
What?
What? Claire,
I want you to listen to me.
I want you
to stay away from him.
He's extremely dangerous.
Do you understand?
So, General Marks...
See, he's like the most decorated,
most powerful, most...
And you're saying
you were framed...
by General Marks
and his special assistant.
Th-That's our defense?
Yup.
Claire, would you sit down
for a minute?
I'm not gonna pretend
I'm looking forward...
to seeing the firm's name
even remotely connected to this.
As it stands now, nobody knows
Ron Chapman is Tom Kubik.
- Alex, my husband is innocent.
- I'm not considering
any other possibility.
And I'm even less interested
than you are in seeing his name
associated with a mass murder.
Claire, l... I just want you
to understand...
all the possible
unforeseen consequences.
Alex, I'll make it
real easy for you.
If the firm's name gets dragged
into this, you don't have
to fire me. I'll resign.
Hey, Josh, remember
that thing from the 20...
Thank you.
Claire, can I do anything?
Yeah. I need a lawyer.
Somebody from the Marine Corps.
Somebody who's beaten 'em before
and is hungry to beat 'em again.
Where will you be?
Bill. Bill.
William.
I'm looking for
a Charlie Grimes.
Well, don't tell me you need a lawyer,
because you are one.
I followed the Norris case.
Talk about a rabbit out of a hat.
- Are you Charles W. Grimes?
- You just can't get over
my decorator, can you?
Welcome to
Grimes and Associate.
- Associate?
- Delilah?
Rumor has it that you're a very good
attorney, formerly of theJAG Corps.
In another life.
And you had an affair with your superior
officer's wife, and they pushed you out.
Let's not dwell on my youthful offenses,
Mrs. Kubik. What do you want?
The military has set up
my husband.
And they've assigned some junior
varsity lieutenant to defend him.
- Who's prosecuting?
- Waldron.
Tell your husband to cop a plea.
Try to make a deal with the judge.
Military justice is to justice as
military music is to music, Mrs. Kubik.
Wake up
and smell the napalm.
Charlie, you're not gonna believe
this shit! They busted me again.
It's like every time
I turn around...
they slap handcuffs on me.
That's because every time
you turn around,
you've got some private's privates
standing at attention, Lola.
I perform a very important
service for the military.
There's a novel defense.
- You do somebody at the base too?
- Yeah, actually.
How about your lawyer here?
Is he any good?
When he gets off his ass,
yeah.
How about it, Mr. Grimes?
- Man, turn this shit off.
- Nice to meet you, Lola.
- I'm due in court in an hour.
- In an hour!
- Jackie?
- I'm here to help, 'cause
what are sisters for?
Wow.
Tacky.
You got evicted, didn't you?
- What happened to the money I sent?
- Too little too late,
too much credit card debt.
- All I need's an extra phone line.
- What for?
My new job.
Psychic hot line.
Don't laugh,
I'm really good at it.
- Twenty-nine past the hour...
Otherwise, kick back.
I got you covered, wall-to-wall.
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning, Mrs. Kubik.
I'm gonna kill
that goddamn clock.
- Hi, G.I. Joe.
- Ma'am.
" Ma'am." Claire, did you just hear that?
He called me "ma'am."
Shall we?
Yeah, let's get outta here.
So I do not need any security
clearance for the pretrial portion.
Yes. The only portions of the trial
that are classified are those...
pertaining directly to the incidents
in El Salvador.
I just... You know,
I hope she didn't think I was staring.
- Who?
- Well, your sister.
Don't worry about it.
She understands. She's psychic.
Okay.
Well, what do you know?
Mr. Grimes has decided
to join us after all.
Mrs. Kubik, you do know
that Charlie Grimes has a
history of being a major drunk?
Are you sober, Mr. Grimes?
Four hundred and sixty-two days,
Mrs. Kubik.
Ain't life grand?
Fill me in.
- Pretrial hearing is in ten.
- Ten what?
Minutes.
What?
You don't think they'll be
impressed with leather?
- Who's the judge?
- Colonel Farrell.
Yeah, it would be.
Full bird colonel
at his terminal rank.
He'll piss all over us
because we're civilians.
And he won't give a shit about
reversals down the line because
he's about ready to retire.
You file any motions?
- Absolutely, dismiss charges,
insufficient evidence.
- Motion denied.
- You haven't even read the brief.
- No doubt neither has Farrell.
- The military judicial system
is based on denial.
- Then we fight the whole system.
No, no, no.
You play by the rules.
You do not fight the system.
Fight the system, you lose.
Isn't that right, Embry?
Say, "yes, sir."
- Yes, sir.
- Don't be a sap, Embry.
Nobody in a uniform
can think for himself.
This is a pretrial hearing. The goal is
to listen and not reveal anything.
- Do we have anything
to reveal, Mrs. Kubik?
- Claire.
- Claire?
- No.
No?
Then that ought to work.
- Which one's the prosecutor?
- Trial counsel.
We call them trial counsels.
- Mrs. Kubik, I'm Major Waldron.
- How do you do?
Hi, Lucas.
Charlie Grimes.
Nice to see you.
Bullshit.
All rise.
Be seated.
This Article 39-A session
is called to order.
I'm Colonel Farrell of the U.S. Marine
Corps. Where the hell is the accused?
Charlie Grimes.
I'll explain later.
Sergeant Chapman, you see the charges
against you. How do you plead?
Your Honor, before
my client submits a plea,
would you please address our motion
to have all charges dismissed?
Motion denied. Since
you are painfully unfamiliar
with our court-martial system,
we don't have clients here.
Sergeant Ron Chapman is the accused,
and I'm still waiting for the plea.
I plead not guilty.
Not guilty.
You may be seated.
Your Honor, prosecution requests
the court's ruling...
on the permissibility of the accused
being represented by his spouse.
- Your Honor...
- I'll allow it.
Thank you, Your Honor.
The prosecution requests a short
pretrial period to ensure security.
Granted. Opening statements are
scheduled for one week from today.
Objection! Your Honor, there's
no way we can prepare defense
for a capital case in one week.
Noted and overruled.
Are we done?
Your Honor, I'd like to add,
the defense has no intention
of waving our right to a public trial...
as guaranteed
by the sixth amendment.
Your Honor, this case involves national
security and classified information.
We would like defense counsel
admonished that any attempt
to try this case in the media...
would be a direct violation
of this court's order.
Your Honor, co-counsel and I
are civilians and not subject
to military orders.
Any such orders, sir, will be taken
for informational purposes only.
Be advised, counsel,
that civilian or not,
you can go to the brig and be
disqualified from participating
in this trial altogether.
All rise.
And so it begins.
See you soon.
He's supposed to be the best.
What the hell was that?
I said you should follow the rules.
I'm the wild card.
- You could've gotten us
thrown off the case.
- Nah, it's too early.
See, if they think we're
gonna go public, we might get
an idea how scared they are.
What do you think,
" Embry-o"?
I think, "Why me?
Why was I assigned to this case?"
Seven guys in Tom's unit,
and all of them say he did it.
But only two of these
eyewitnesses are on their list.
Hernandez and Troy Abbot.
Now what happened to the other five?
Uh, dead.
- All of them?
- Dead how?
Two were killed in combat,
the Gulf and Panama.
One was murdered.
And the other two, accidents.
Accidents, huh?
I know a couple of P.I. 's,
ex-Green Berets.
Not very ethical, but maybe
they could get us the unofficial
version of how these guys died.
Could be useful.
Here we go. Troy Abbot,
Sacramento, California.
Doing four to six in Lompoc,
armed robbery.
And Waldron's office is trying
to expedite his parole.
Now, why am I certain
he's gonna succeed?
- 'Cause it's the Marine Corps.
" Be all you can be."
- That's the army.
Mrs. Kubik, I really think
our theory should be
that Hernandez acted alone.
No one's gonna believe that Brigadier
General Marks was in on this.
In other words,
you don't believe it.
Wh...
Mrs. Kubik,
that's not my point.
- Do you believe Tom or not?
- Hey, easy. He's just
expressing his opinion.
Isn't there something you should be
doing somewhere else?
Not really.
Can I get you
another coffee, sir?
Uh, no, ma'am.
I'm good.
Okay.
- Girl. Sit down.
Come here.
I'm gonna have to agree with Embry.
A guy like Marks...
smells, looks,
tastes credible.
Put him on the stand, he's just
gonna give Hernandez credibility.
- Right, that's what I'm saying.
- Well, young man's had
an original thought.
- You know what?
- What?
- You know what?
- What?
- Go to hell.
- Another one.
- Hello?
- Mrs. Kubik, will
you hold for Major Waldron?
Yes, I'll hold
for Major Waldron.
- Mrs. Kubik?
- Hello, Major.
Why don't you folks come down
to my office about 8:00?
- Let's try to work something out.
- We'll be there.
I can't believe it.
They want a deal.
I love being a wild card.
But, Mr. Kubik, sir,
voluntary manslaughter,
only one specification,
that's only five years.
Plus one condition, that you
sign a nondisclosure agreement.
And as your counsel, l...
Claire, tell the man to take
the deal of the century.
Sweetheart?
Honey, I won't do five minutes
for a crime I didn't commit.
Do you have any idea,
any of you,
do you have any idea what
it's like to spend 23 hours
a day in a six-by-eight cell?
Five years in Leavenworth. They'll
make sure I'm dead long before that.
So, motion denied.
Come on in.
Based on our conversation...
That's all right, Major.
We're here to tell you we're gonna pass.
Thanks anyway.
Mrs. Kubik.
Personally, I'm quite happy
to go to trial with this case,
but there is a lot of interest
in putting this thing behind us.
It works for everyone:
command and your husband.
And Major Hernandez
and General Marks.
See you in court, sir.
Here on the FantasyJewelry Hour.
You can expect
to pay $ 1 99 for a ring like this.
This beautiful piece is available...
So, no deal.
Can you believe I asked my husband
to do five years in prison?
Go ahead. Tell me what a waste
of oxygen all lawyers are.
So if you're on the phone,
don't get off the line.
- You're not gonna wanna miss this.
- That's right.
You're curiously quiet
on the subject.
Jackie, would you please turn that down?
I mean, come on...
Your husband came to my village
and killed my family.
And it's true,
lawyers are a waste of oxygen.
- Drop this deal, Mrs... .
- Jackie? Mrs. Kubik?
- Drop this deal, Mrs... .
- Jackie? Mrs. Kubik?
Jackie? Oh, my God.
He ran out!
Claire?
Claire, are you okay?
Bastards!
It's Hernandez.
Oh, goddamn.
We turned down their deal,
and he's trying to scare us.
Baby, you don't know
how these people work.
I don't know how any
of it works.
- What do you mean?
- This other life of yours.
You don't believe me,
do you?
Of course, I believe you.
Baby, I'll take a polygraph.
There's no need for it.
It's not even admissible in court.
The hell with the courts.
I wanna do it for us.
Hey, Ronnie. Or Tommy
or Paco or whatever it is.
You haven't changed a bit.
- Major Hernandez, this is
an unethical exparte...
- I'm just here to help.
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, you oughta plead this out, Ace.
Major... Tom, don't!
Stop it! Stop!
You're making it worse!
Who let Major Hernandez in?
He's not authorized to be here!
- See? Look at your killer!
- He is provoking my client!
- Who is in charge? Who let him in here?
- Look at your killer!
- He's not supposed to be here!
- Major Hernandez said he was
a defense witness.
He is not a witness for the defense!
Who is in charge?
I wan... I want to talk
to whoever is in charge!
Is your real name Ron Chapman?
Yes.
Regarding the incident at Las Colinas
on March 1 5, 1 988,
- Will you answer
my questions truthfully?
- Yes.
Did you actively participate
in the death of anyone...
during the
1 5th of March 1 988 shootings?
Mrs. Kubik?
You passed.
Of course I passed.
Are we being monitored?
No, it's absolutely secure.
Absolutely secure?
What do you mean?
What do you think I mean?
And, Lieutenant Colonel,
- Were there any eyewitnesses
to this massacre?
- Yes.
We had seven eyewitness statements
all I.D. -ing Chapman as the shooter.
Thank you.
Nothing further,
Your Honor.
Colonel LaPierre,
you were and still are...
a special agent with the Criminal
Investigations Division...
- In charge of this investigation, yes?
- That's correct.
So, when you say that the
investigation was not flawed,
you're basically giving yourself
a big thumbs-up.
I'm just expressing
my opinion.
So help you God, no doubt.
Now, is it possible, Colonel,
that these so-called witnesses
were coached before you got
your hands on them?
I guess it's possible...
but unlikely.
Mm-hmm.
And are you aware...
that of the seven witnesses,
two were subsequently killed in combat?
Yes, I'm aware of that.
And another three, three relatively
young men, have died as well?
- Yes.
- Let's see.
There was a Lieutenant Allen
of Longview, Texas: hit-and-run.
A Sergeant Stenstrom of Taos,
New Mexico... accidental drowning.
And the other, an unfortunate
mountain climbing fall.
- That sounds right.
- Does it?
Well, that's interesting,
Colonel,
seeing as how I just made up
those causes of death.
I mean, there was
no accidental drowning,
and no mountain climbing fall.
I do have the details of
these tragic deaths, including
a fatal home-invasion robbery,
if you care
to look at them.
I'm... I'm a little fuzzy
on the details.
- I wasn't in charge
of those investigations.
- No further questions, Colonel.
- My investigation was
strictly by the book.
- No further questions.
- Hello?
Claire, it's Charlie. You know the
witness in Tom's unit that was murdered?
Yeah, home-invasion robbery.
He was killed right
in front of his wife.
And the word is, she accused the
military of having been involved.
Will she talk to us?
Problem there is
that she disappeared right after that.
- Hey. Is this a bad time?
- Hey.
A bad time? No.
I was thinking we could go over
the Hernandez cross.
Well, I was just taking
a break, 'cause, uh,
going over the Hernandez
stuff myself and...
Please don't be mad.
It wasn't him. It was all me.
Mrs. Kubik, I want you to know
this doesn't affect anything, okay?
I mean, my work.
l... I'm totally up for it.
He is.
Come on, Claire, we were
just going over his briefs.
Claire, wait.
You never can take anything
seriously, can you? Nothing, ever.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You know, you get to be a lawyer,
so I gotta get to bang one, right?
We're closed. Closed!
Sorry, lady, we're closed.
Excuse me. Can you tell me
how to get to State Street?
- Sure. Two blocks down.
- Thank you.
Sorry.
Want some cheese?
Yeah, I could make
an omelet.
I'll make one. You want cheddar?
American? Swiss?
Cheddar's good.
Mrs. Chapman?
It's Kubik.
Okay, Mrs. Kubik. I want to tell you
about what I do for a living.
This sicko bothering you? 'Cause I know
how to deal with weirdos...
- Who hang around
the frozen food section.
- I teach guys to beat the box.
Who are you?
I teach techniques that enable
anyone to beat a polygraph.
Like, special operations
personnel...
who might be captured,
interrogated behind enemy lines.
Basically, I teach people
to create a new persona.
That way, when they lie,
they're not really lying.
Why are you
telling me this?
I don't know.
But my guess is, you do.
Who are you?
Who sent you?
I was just asked to convey
this message to you.
Just so you'd know...
along with everyone else.
Good night, Mrs. Kubik.
Okay, get outta here.
Hey, honey.
Is it true?
What?
That you get that kind of training,
to beat the box?
- What are you talking about?
- The polygraph, Tom.
Sure, but... I didn't beat the box.
I told the truth.
Why didn't you tell me
you could do that?
'Cause it just didn't occur to me.
That's not a part of who I am anymore.
Well, that's it, isn't it? That's it
right there. How do I know who you are?
Claire, you're the only one
who knows who I am.
You know what?
That's it. L...
I don't care anymore.
I did it.
I shot 'em all.
Yeah.
For the fun of it.
Why not?
Who the hell cares, Claire?
You know, the man you've been
waking up to every morning...
Ioves, just loves to kill women
and children... in cold blood.
'Cause l...
Who the hell knows why, Claire?
Am I making any sense?
Does what I'm saying make
any sense to you?
No.
Oh, Tom.
This whole base
isn't secure.
They know every move
we make.
Tell me. How do they know, Charlie?
Huh? How do they know?
Good question,
Mrs. Kubik. Good question.
- Damn, Charlie Grimes.
- Hey, Renny.
It's been ages.
Did you come to beg
for leftovers?
No, I just want to look
through your trash.
Okay?
What's the problem?
Take it easy. Goddamn!
- Hold his legs.
- No. No.
- Hold him.
- No, no, please.
- Hey.
Come on, come on.
I just don't believe it.
I refuse.
And my sister-in-law used to say truth
is less fun than fiction.
- Terry would never do that.
- Oh, you're screwing him,
so you know him?
Excuse me,
Mrs. Ron Chapman.
- I gotta sit down.
Oh. Well, well, well.
- What happened?
- Lucy, you got a lotta explain' to do.
Charlie, you all right?
Wh... Who did this?
Just some of the old gang
from down at the club.
Just some of the old gang
from down at the club.
The same group that mysteriously
knows every move we make.
Wha... What are you
talking about?
How did they know about
the polygraph? Tarot cards?
What... Were you with them?
Were you drinking with Waldron?
Wait a minute. Every Friday everybody
drinks there. We don't talk about cases.
Charlie, you were in the Corps.
You know what it's like.
Right?
- Claire, you can understand.
- I understand you're fired.
What? No, listen.
This case'll be over, and you'll
be gone, but I'll still be here.
- Did you know about this?
- What? Wait a minute. Y...
Did you, did you know
about the attack on me and Claire?
- What? Do you seriously think...
- Or was it coincidence
you happened to show up then?
What do you say we go to the hospital,
Charlie? I'm worried about your ribs.
Ah, just get me some ice.
Hell, I've been here before.
Oh, and I won't be there
for Hernandez. I got word...
Troy Abbot got his parole.
I gotta go track him down.
Well, kind of sick.
See, Chapman taunted the victims.
He tossed his gun around like a cowboy.
Kind of showing off, and then...
he executed them.
Please continue, Major.
I ran to the south end of the village,
but it was too late.
They were
all dead. Chapman was still shooting.
- Chapman!
Two members of the unit assisted me,
and we got him down, got his weapon.
Major, you say Sergeant Chapman
did some sick things.
Yet you, his X.O., allowed him
to proceed without any supervision?
I didn't realize
he'd take it that far.
Had Chapman ever been cited
for this kind of behavior before?
- No, he had not.
- In fact, wasn't he...
"the most experienced and reliable
member of Detachment 27"?
Before you answer, that's a direct quote
from a report you filed.
Defense exhibit "A."
- Chapman was a good marine.
- Courageous.
- Honest.
- I thought so.
- The kind of good marine who
would not go along with a cover-up...
- Objection.
for you who actually committed
the killing.
- Objection!
- Sustained! Make that
your last outburst, Counselor.
The jury members, you are instructed
to disregard that accusation.
Major, how is it possible that
seven men, spread all over a village,
would witness
the exact same thing?
We all got to the barn
at the same time.
Wow!
How convenient.
Doesn't it make more sense that
some of those alleged witnesses...
were ordered to lie
on their C.I.D. statements?
- They were not ordered to lie.
- How do you know?
I would know if something like that
happened to my men.
And if something like that happened
to your men, you would tell us?
Of course.
I wouldn't lie about it.
But, Major,
you were trained and often compelled
to lie about your clandestine missions.
you were trained and often compelled
to lie about your clandestine missions.
As I understand it,
you're trained to beat a polygraph.
Is it true you possess
that talent?
I'd only use it if interrogated
by the enemy, ma'am.
That's good to know.
So, tell me this, Major.
Do you consider me a friend?
- Hey.
- Hey.
I ain't done nothin' with her.
I ain't interested if there's
gonna be pimps involved.
Oh, no. No. You got that all wrong,
brother. That ain't me.
Shit.
I should be so lucky.
No, I'm just supposed to deliver
this to, uh... Troy Abbot.
- That you?
- Yeah. Who from?
- It's from Jimmy Hernandez,
down at the base.
- Hey, Charles.
- Grace, what are you doing here?
- Got a call from the base.
- You got a call from the base?
- Yup.
- Bullshit you got this call!
I got this...
- What, bitch?
Who you raisin' up. Get up!
I'm gonna whup your nasty ass self!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
Why are you always gettin'into trouble?
Why you always tryin'to play daddy?
- Apologize to the man.
- I ain't apologi...
Do you want me
to apologize, baby?
Do you? Hmm?
Gracie can apologize real good.
Do you? Hmm?
Do you want me
to say sorry? I'm sorry.
- So they paroled you?
- Yeah.
Then they bring me all the way
to this dump to testify.
- What happened that night?
- Hey, I don't know, man.
It was years ago.
El Salvador.
Some massacre shit.
I'll bet some damn
officer ordered it too, right?
- You ain't thirsty?
- Hmm? Oh, yeah. Shit, yeah.
I'm just, you know...
just chillin'.
- So then what did you
say back? That's like...
- Yeah, what'd you say?
- Uh-uh.
- Come on tell us. We never
get to hear shit like this.
- All right, hey, hey.
- Who we gonna tell,
you know what I'm sayin'?
What'd you say?
That I was nowhere
near the place.
And they want me to say that
I saw this guy shootin'.
- Damn. That's intense.
- You gonna do it?
Hell, I already did it
in my statement to the C.I.D.
I just gotta testify to what
I already said, you know?
What's C.I.D.?
Criminal Investigative Division.
Yeah, but what about
this poor guy?
Forget the poor guy.
I mean, what are you gonna do?
Your X.0. comes up...
says, "You see Chapman
shoot the wetbacks?"
You say,
" No, sir, I didn't."
He says, " Be sure about this.
Your career's on the line."
Everybody else said he did it.
So I say
what they want to hear.
One more witness,
no difference. Right?
Right.
9-1-1.
What is your address and emergency?
- Yes. 1 01 45.
- All right, ma'am, is this an emergency?
There's somebody trying
to get in the house.
- Claire?
- Hello? Is he in?
No. No, no.
It's okay. I'm sorry.
- False alarm?
- Yeah, it was a false alarm.
- Thanks. - Claire?
- Charlie, you scared me to death.
- Huh?
- That guy was out there.
- What guy?
- You've been drinking.
- Who, me?
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no. No, no. You got it wrong.
See, I'm just a victim of hazardous
working conditions.
- Sure you are.
- No, really.
- That man was watching the house.
- No. Ain't nobody out there.
What is this?
What is this?
Looks like a recorder.
Hmm. Is Abbot on here...
saying he never saw what he agreed
to testify to in court?
- You didn't?
- I most certainly did.
And you know what?
He was nowhere near the shooting.
I mean, nowhere near it.
Charlie, this is fabulous.
This does it. This proves
they're setting him up.
Charlie, l...
You really think I wanted to give up
483 days of sobriety...
and start all over
at day one, Claire?
I'll make some coffee.
Oh, wait a minute.
Not so fast. See, I figure...
Oh, wait a minute.
Not so fast. See, I figure...
" Hey, you already
slipped, Charlie.
So what's one more gonna hurt?"
How about it, Claire?
- One for our side.
- I can't. I'm trying to get pregnant.
Oh.
Well...
I'm not trying
to get pregnant.
I am certainly not
trying to get pregnant.
You're absolutely right.
But a judge will be more lenient.
- You're late, Counsel.
- Prosecution requests a sidebar.
Make it good.
Your Honor, our next witness,
Troy Abbot, has disappeared.
- What?
- Things are gone from his room.
We've notified the M.P. 's.
Notified, my ass. You let him out
of jail and you turned him loose.
We have a tape that impeaches
Abbot's original statement
and fully vindicates our client.
- There was no discovery about a tape.
- You got spies all over!
In my chambers, everybody.
Court is recessed.
- All rise!
I mean, what are you gonna do?
Your X.0. comes up, says...
"You see Chapman shoot the wetbacks?"
You say, "No, sir, I didn't. "
He says, "Be sure about this.
Your career's on the line. "
Everybody else said he did it.
So I say what they want to hear.
One more witness,
no difference. Right?
Without Abbot, we can't
authenticate this tape.
For all we know, he may have been
coerced, any number of things.
- It's inadmissible
- What?
Your Honor, you admitted Abbot's C.I.D.
statement. We need this to rebut it.
This tape clearly
exonerates Ron Chapman.
The C.I.D. statement was taken
by an objective party.
Bullshit! He lied!
- They lied! How the hell
is that objective?
- The tape is excluded.
- What's next?
- Your Honor!
Excluded, Counselor.
Major?
We're out of witnesses, Your Honor.
The prosecution rests.
Your Honor, this is a capital case.
An objective judge would admit
the tape, and you know it!
We'll hear from
the defense next Friday.
This is grounds
for an appeal.
- Honey?
- Claire...
- We'll appeal this.
- Claire, stop. You can't fight 'em.
- Tom, don't talk that way.
- We'll get another break.
- You do not know these people.
Stop it before
you get yourself hurt.
We can win this!
I am not gonna let them do this to you!
What are you doing?
- Is that a...
Must have done it when
they installed the phones.
And you two were
so ready to blame Terry.
So self-righteous.
Let's go to Farrell,
demand a mistrial.
Denied. There's no way
we'd be able to prove...
- That Waldron or Hernandez
had anything to do with this.
- Then what?
We are out of witnesses
and we are out of time.
Maybe it's time we heard
from the brigadier general.
- Not on the stand.
- No.
- You think we should pay him a visit?
- I think you should pay him a visit.
Why me?
Are you scared of him?
No. But I'm just a thorn
in the Marine Corps' ass.
But you, my dear,
you're the pretty, young,
sympathetic little wife.
I don't play those games.
Shit.
- General Marks?
- No press, please.
- I'm not the press. How do you do?
- Miss, uh...
Kubik. Claire Kubik. I'm representing
my husband, Sergeant Ron Chapman?
Mrs. Kubik.
Good day.
- General Marks, you gave
James Hernandez the order...
- I have nothing to say to you.
to eliminate Danilo Chacon and
his terrorist group at Las Colinas.
You knew they fully expected
Detachment 27 to come under attack.
You're a dignified man, sir.
End the cover-up.
- How dare you.
- Your man James Hernandez
overacted and opened fire.
- You know what happened.
- Young lady, you are way out of line.
Listen to this, sir,
and tell me how out of line I am.
This is C.W. Grimes and Associates.
If you want to talk to Charlie, you
should leave a message after the beep.
If you want to talk to Delilah,
you should get your head examined.
- Well, Charlie,
that was a great idea.
The man flicked me off his suit
like I was a flea.
I am gonna lose my mind. I mean,
we cannot let them get away with this.
There has to be somebody
who was there.
There has to be
somebody who's...
- Directory assistance.
- The Herald.
- Of course not.
When you settle down,
I do have something to say.
You're representing
your own husband in the court-martial?
Is there a military
conspiracy at work here?
You know that I cannot
legally comment on...
the details of
a court-martial proceeding.
I would, however,
like to say emphatically
that my husband is innocent.
There is a man who's a stranger
to me who said to me last week...
that all lawyers
are a waste of oxygen.
As a wife and an attorney, I greatly
fear that justice in this case...
As a wife and an attorney, I greatly
fear that justice in this case...
will not ultimately be served...
and I would like to challenge that man
or anyone who has firsthand knowledge...
of what happened that day in El Salvador
to please come forward.
- Charlie?
- Laurel, just to recap...
today's press conference
with attorney Claire Kubik,
she's continually insisting
that her husband is innocent.
This attorney and wife
is clearly standing by her man.
Reporting live for Channel 1 2 News,
this is Karen Cobb.
- Hello?
- You just had to do it.
The whole firm just saw you
on the six o'clock news.
Hello, Alex. I have been
expecting your...
Claire?
- Claire?
- I'll...
You'll, um...
- I'll send you
my resignation tomorrow.
- Claire?
- Get in.
- No.
Wait. Okay, wait.
No.
Where are we going?
I want to know the truth.
I want to know
what happened at Las Colinas.
You don't care
about the truth.
All you care about
is saving your husband.
Get out.
Get out.
You want to know
about Las Colinas?
Women like you...
beautiful.
Young.
And the old people...
begging for their lives.
Jesus Christ.
It was 1 2 years ago.
They all look the same,
a bunch of gringos in uniform...
- Don't be foolish.
- It's a photograph.
I just want to show you
a photograph.
I remember him,
the one with the patch on his eye,
The blood still fresh from the explosion
at Monte Azul.
This man was at Monte Azul?
Of course he was.
He killed Danilo Chacon.
Chacon was in the cafe
in a secret meeting,
- And this man was there, . He was there.
That's how he hurt his eye.
No. But Danilo Chacon blew up the cafe
and killed the three American students...
You people believe anything.
The students were killed by mistake,
because the American military
didn't know they were there.
To cover it up,
they blamed the rebels...
and pretended to look for their leader
in Las Colinas.
But they knew
he was already dead.
They knew they had
killed him with the bomb.
- Thanks a lot.
- Ah, you're welcome.
Well, if it isn't
little Miss Six O'clock News.
You're drunk.
You were supposed
to call me, but...
- When you got... Huh?
- Charlie?
I called you.
I was out, but you
could have called back.
I thought
we had an agreement.
Excuse me.
I thought
we had an agreement.
I thought...
I thought me and you was partners.
- But partners don't decide
to do dumb shit...
- Charlie, it worked.
without telling the other part of the
team they done some dumb shit.
- Charlie? I just spent
an hour with a guy.
- Huh? What?
He's the real deal.
He saw the whole thing.
Tom's innocent.
This proves it.
There's a cover-up, Charlie,
and it's bigger than we thought.
I need you sober.
- Yeah.
- Come on.
- Yeah, all right.
- Let's get you home.
Okay, baby.
All right.
- No, Charlie.
- Hmm? Chris, last one.
- Just one more.
- Forget about it.
- Just one more.
- Forget about it.
I got it.
I got it.
Come on, partner.
All right, partner.
Damn! What was that?
What? Oh, my God!
Shit! It's oil!
Hi, sweetie.
Mm.
I had the worst dream.
I dreamt I was pregnant and these people
came and took the baby away.
You one lucky girl.
You and the gentleman.
I want you to take something.
Here, baby.
Don't you worry about a thing.
You'll have another baby.
What?
- Don't you worry.
- What?
You'll have another one.
Jackie?
- No. No.
- I'm sorry.
No. No. No.
That's not fair. No.
Shh. Be strong.
Be strong.
You have to rest. Shh.
- Claire, it's Charlie.
Come in.
Hi.
- How's your neck?
- Oh, it's all right.
I've had worse whiplash just
looking around at pretty women
like you on the street.
I'm truly sorry, Claire.
I wanted that baby
so much, Charlie.
You know, I kept thinking...
maybe there was something wrong
with me or I didn't deserve it or...
I wouldn't be a good mother.
- I really didn't think
they'd do something like this.
- Hmm.
- I'm at zero, Charlie.
- Hey, whoa. Whoa, now. Listen to me.
I know about zero.
I've hit bottom.
And I was on my way back there
before the accident.
But you know what?
I think we were spared for some reason,
and you gotta believe that.
So, for you and me, kiddo,
this is day one.
Okay?
Hey, you got another visitor.
Hello.
Merry Christmas.
You all right?
I owe you an apology,
Lieutenant.
We were mistaken.
Ah, that's okay.
Although, I'm not sure "merry"
is the right word to use around here.
Well, that's where you might be wrong,
Mrs. Kubik. Uh...
You see, if it's true
James Hernandez injured his eye
in the bombing at the cafe,
- He would have got
immediate treatment for it.
- And they just keep records...
of those covert operations so people
like us can go look them up?
No, he would have insisted on it
for insurance purposes...
so the government couldn't
screw him out of compensation.
Here you are.
Agent Mullins!
I just need
a minute of your time.
Somehow I'm confident
it's not my rugged good looks...
to which I owe the honor
of this visit.
The press accepted the official version
of the story.
Well, what if Chacon
didn't blow up the cafe?
- Mrs. Kubik...
- What ifJames Hernandez,
the X.0. of my husband's unit,
blew up the cafe and killed the
American students by mistake?
What if Brigadier General Marks,
to cover the whole thing up,
staged a raid on Las Colinas?
What if all this is not my job
and none of my business?
I'm just asking you
to help me look into it.
Make it a lean one, chief.
- Why not? I know you have your sources.
- My sources?
- You keep saying it's not your job.
- Good.
- I wasn't sure you were listening.
- Well, then whose job is it?
Come on, whose job?
Goddamn, what a pain in the ass you are.
Hernandez was injured
in the explosion.
There has got to be
a classified medical document...
somewhere.
- Yeah?
- Hey, Charlie, it's me, man.
- Oh, hey, Mac.
- I've been checking out the rumors...
about how those witnesses
in Chapman's unit really died.
I've been all over the place, man. I got
expenses... phone bills, plane tickets.
- It's gonna cost you, man.
It's gonna cost you.
- Well, you told me that.
I found the wife
of the one who was murdered.
Lisa Stenstrom
is living in Mexico.
- And she swears the military
killed her husband.
- Oh, yeah?
Just inside, ma'am.
- Have you heard from Charlie?
- He called about an hour ago,
but he was really weird,
like he didn't want
to talk on the phone.
Well, like Charlie, I don't know
if I should talk on the phone.
- He did say he was in Mexico.
- In Mexico? What is he doing in Mexico?
- I don't know. Are you
on your way back here?
- I'm gonna stop in Los Angeles first.
- So I'll see ya.
- Bye.
General.
You all have had him
all night. It's my turn.
Shall we?
We uncovered the real reason you sent
Detachment 27 to Las Colinas.
- Uncovered? It's a matter
of public record.
- Well, not really.
What is a matter
of record, though,
is James Hernandez sustained
an injury to his left eye
in the bombing at Monte Azul.
Eyewitnesses place him in the truck
from which the grenade was thrown.
- Mm-hmm.
- And he had that injury treated
at a hospital in San Salvador...
before Las Colinas.
Your gung ho raid was
a decoy for your bombing.
You know, uh,
this fairy tale of yours...
would have to be based
on classified material,
even if any of it
were remotely possible.
Now you're bluffing,
and you're doing it badly.
You know, General Marks,
we'd be only too happy to
have you testify under oath...
- And allow the court
to fully explore our evidence.
For example, classified document
dated 3-1 4-88.
Major Hernandez's medical report
for a shrapnel wound...
at Santa Maria hospital.
That's the same day and
mighty close to Monte Azul.
You have no shame.
Look what you're willing to do
to free a murderer.
Pick up the phone and call the right
people. I want the charges dropped...
- Or the document goes public.
- Haven't you noticed...
that you've
been unlucky lately?
Now caution might be
the order of the day for you.
I am not afraid of you.
I've already survived you once,
you smug son of a bitch.
The real question is
will you survive me?
Make it go away, General,
or the document goes public.
For both our sakes, sir.
Pull over, right here.
Jackie.
Jackie?
Jackie?
- Ma'am.
- Claire?
- You all right?
- Oh, my God. Yeah.
- What the hell's that all about?
- Colonel Farrell wants us in
court tomorrow morning at 0800.
Waldron filed a motion to have
you disqualified from the case...
for talking to the press.
- Any word from Charlie?
- I've been trying him
on his cell all day.
Just getting voice mail.
We've still got Hernandez's
medical report.
I'll...
I'll do my best.
Farrell wouldn't admit
a classified document any more
than he would the Abbot tape.
- Maybe you should take the deal.
- There's no more deal.
Not now.
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Kubik.
- Why don't you spend the night out?
I don't know if it's a good idea
to be around here tonight.
l, um,
could use a little time
on my own.
- Hey. You heard from Charlie?
- No.
- What's going on, honey?
- I don't know.
All rise.
Be seated.
Major Waldron, Mrs. Kubik,
please approach.
Major Waldron, Mrs. Kubik,
please approach.
- What the hell is this?
- For reasons of national security,
the Department of Defense
has determined that charges
against Sergeant Ron Chapman...
are to be withdrawn.
Court is closed.
Sergeant Chapman, you're free to go.
- Oh, my God!
Shit! Let's go.
Let's get out of here.
Hey, Charlie. Listen, in case
you're interested, pal, we won.
We're going to Marin.
We're blowin' this town.
- If you ever want to call me,
that's where we'll be.
Hope you're okay.
Jesus!
Look at this.
What do you suggest I do?
HaveJackie meet us on
the next block with her car.
Will there be more of them
at the airport?
- Probably.
- Why do we need
to bother? Let's just drive.
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Embry.
Okay, good.
Thank you for everything.
- Yeah. You take care
of yourself, Mr. Kubik.
- You too.
- Okay.
- Thanks, Jackie.
Well, kid, turns out
you're okay.
Well, you too, kid.
- Thank you so much, Mrs. Kubik.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- We're gonna take our time.
- Okay.
So we'll call you when we get there.
Probably around 7:00.
- Bye.
- Bye.
About a week before Paul was murdered...
he started making phone calls
to an old Marine Corps buddy...
who, incidentally, was killed
about two months after Paul.
I don't know what they talked about,
but it really upset him.
You have no idea
what it's like...
to see somebody you love
killed right in front of you.
And you believe this
is somehow connected to the military?
- Yeah.
It's just a feeling,
'cause Paul knew him.
You know? Well, he just seemed
to recognize him,
the thing he did
with the hands.
Paul seemed to know
who he was.
You think that owl's still around here?
You know one thing
that bothered me
more than anything?
I couldn't protect you.
I had to stand by
while they hurt you.
Shit. I should have
got more champagne.
I love you.
I love you.
- I thought... you unplugged that.
- I did, but I tried Charlie
one more time.
Hi, Claire. It's, uh, it's me.
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.
- Look, I'm...
- Be right back.
I'm sorry
I wasn't there today.
- L, uh, let you down. Hi.
- Yeah, Charlie.
Look, Claire, I'm real sorry. I just...
- I couldn't get there.
- Why today, Charlie, of all days?
I mean, what if Marks had opted
to testify or what...
You know what,
I don't want to talk about it.
I thought I had a friend.
I am your friend, kiddo.
Sure you are.
Just say a toast for my husband
while you drink yourself silly.
- Good-bye, Charlie.
- Listen. I am your friend.
I was being your friend today more
than you'd care to know, kiddo.
- What do you mean?
- We need to talk.
I just... I just don't think
now is a good time for it.
- Where are you going?
- I think A.A. meetings are
supposed to be anonymous.
- I'm gonna get
some more champagne.
Okay. Hurry back.
Are Marks and Hernandez
going to give us trouble?
- Is Tom still there?
- No. He's going to the store.
All right, get to your computer.
Pull up your calendar.
Find out where your husband
was onJanuary 20, 1 997.
- Why are you doing this?
- Look it up, Claire. It's important.
Uh, Tom was in Santa Fe,
New Mexico.
He met a collector.
I picked him up from the airport.
February 1 0, '97.
Houston, Texas, trade show.
Claire, listen to me.
Those are the dates that
witnesses were murdered.
Stenstrom was murdered January 20, 1 997
in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
Allen died in Houston, Texas,
February 1 0.
Oh, and wait a minute.
Didn't Hernandez say that Tom
tossed his gun back and forth...
taunting his victims?
- Is he ambidextrous?
- Yeah.
Stenstrom's wife said the man
shot her husband,
then tossed the gun
back and forth showing off...
and shot him again
with the other hand.
- I can't talk about this right now.
- Sure.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Claire.
- I just... I just thought
I ought to let you know.
- Fine.
I gotta go.
I thought you went
to the store.
Uh, I grabbed the wrong keys.
Those are the right keys.
Those areJackie's.
Oh.
- What are you working on there?
- Nothing. Um...
You want to run out with me
to get some champagne?
I'm not really in the mood
for champagne.
- Ouch, Tom.
- I'm sorry.
Well... well,
let's just talk then.
Talk about what?
About what you were
talking about on the phone.
What, do you think
I'm stupid, Claire?
You must.
Why didn't you come to me
to talk about it?
- You must like to keep your secrets...
- Your life is one big secret.
Did you do it, Tom?
You can tell me.
I certainly have
a right to know.
Risked my life for it.
Lost a baby.
- Claire...
- Did you kill those people?
Yes.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I did. I had to. Uh...
That's what I was
trained to do, Claire.
They lied to me.
They told me
they were terrorists.
Told me to interrogate them
and so...
you do what you have to do
to get every...
any kind of information
you can out of them, and...
so I did.
Because I was
the best at it.
And they knew it.
What about
Stenstrom and Allen?
What about
Stenstrom and Allen?
Stenstrom saw me
on the street one day,
and he told Allen, and they
needed to go away. You see?
- Do not look at me like that.
I do not...
not deserve it.
Sorry.
I'm a bit tired.
I was just protecting us.
We'll get over this.
You'll see. L...
Claire!
No!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Tom! Oh, God,
you're hurting me! You're hurting me.
Ow! You're hurting me.
You're hurting me.
Stop it. Tom.
Stop it!
Stop. Look at me.
Look at me.
- Honey. Honey...
- Shut up. Shut up. You're a liar.
Liar.
Don't lie to me.
Liar.
I didn't want to have
to do this to you, Claire.
Tom. Tom.
Es... Esta bien.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Esta...
I'm sorry.
You're listening to the Bay Area's
number-one station for sports,
news and information...
You have a whole suite
of offices here, Charlie.
Yeah, but, uh, don't talk about it
because I might get spooked.
I mean, who knows
what might happen?
How are you holding up?
I'm okay.
- Same old associate?
- Oh, yeah.
She's back there
in the back somewhere.
I just brought her a bone back
from lunch, so she's probably busy.
Hello.
Come and see me. Yeah.
- Ah. Hello. -
You know, I often ask myself
why I never left San Lazaro.
Then it occurred to me that,
hell, I never left because
I didn't have anyplace else to go.
You know,
it could read
"Grimes and Kubik."
It's gotta say "Grimaldi."
- Huh?
- My maiden name. And, Charlie,
you gotta do something
about these colors.
- What?
- Well, I'm very sensitive
about my work environment.
Really?
- Yeah. So I was thinking
about a tropical color.
- So?
Just like a really pretty...
With a little contrasting trim
on the windows.
- Claire!
- Uh, Charlie, check out this exterior.
I mean, it's, uh, skid row chic.
I understand that.
But, um, the watermark's
gotta go. That's a given.
