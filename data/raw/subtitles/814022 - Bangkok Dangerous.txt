My job takes me to a lot of places.
lt's got its down sides.
l sleep alone. l eat alone.
l'm used to it, though.
l'd like to meet someone.
But it's tough when you live
out of a suitcase.
l go where l'm told...
do what l'm told.
l shouldn't complain.
The work is steady.
The money's good,
but it's not for everyone.
My name's Joe.
This is what l do.
You're late.
Sorry, Mr. London.
They closed Chechov bridge.
You're leaving?
l need the phone.
l can help with the bags.
No, l can handle it.
lf you ever come back,
l can, l can use the money.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
l was taught four rules...
One, ''Don't ask questions''.
There is no such thing
as right and wrong.
Two, ''don't take an interest in people
outside of work''.
There is no such thing as trust.
Three, ''Erase every trace''.
Come anonymous
and leave nothing behind.
Four, ''Know when to get out''.
Just thinking about it.
Means it's time
before you lose your edge,
before you become a target.
So you look for the right opportunity.
Nothing too risky.
Get the money
and disappear forever.
This is it.
Four hits, one location.
The lastjob.
Purpose of your visit to Bangkok,
Mr. Vincent?
Holiday.
Bangkok.
lt's corrupt,
dirty and dense.
All my clients have one thing
in common.
They feed off the people.
There's big money in misery.
Where there's money,
there's competition.
and the guy paying me
usually wins.
How will we know when he's arrived?
We'll know when he arranges the pick-up.
You're sure he's reliable?
The Russians swear by him.
How do you swear by...
a man you've never met?
We don't know him. He doesn't know us.
lt's better for us that way.
lt always starts the same way.
Just like l was taught.
Secure a safe location.
Somewhere off the beaten path
where you have privacy.
But you stay invisible too long, the human race
starts to look like another species,
so you venture out, you observe,
and then you return to
your invisible world,
like a ghost.
Hey, Larry Check out the pussy here.
-Check out these girls.
-Hey, girls, what's up?

and, above all they have
to be disposable.

That was your first lesson.
Why didn't l kill him?
Maybe it's because,
and this is strange,
somehow,
when l looked into his eyes,
l saw myself,
so l became his teacher.
The best way to defend yourself is to know
when something's about to happen.
So, you have to learn
to read your surroundings.
See that man in the red jacket?
What man?
You're living in a city of mirrors.
Store windows, glass office buildings,
polished steel,
eyes in the back of your head.

Political assassination wasn't in the contract.
So, there are two ways to go.
Refuse the job and walk away now,
or, do the job and walk away rich.
The truth is almost anyone one can take out a politician.
That's not the hard part.
The hard part is getting away with it.
He wants more money.
lt's a big job. There's risk.
Yes. He knows who we are.
lf he were caught,
it could lead back to us.

When the nightmare becomes real,

You just run.
Anyone in the way goes down.
