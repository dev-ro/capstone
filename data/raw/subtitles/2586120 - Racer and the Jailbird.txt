Gino!
Gino, goddammit.
Come here!
He can't get out of here.
Gino, you pain in the ass!
Come here!
Let us handle this, sir.
The police are here,
to throw you in prison.
Shut up!
l'll let the dogs out.
That'll bring him running.
He's scared of nothing.
But dogs...
Leave it to us, sir.
lt will be all right.
Gino, l'm letting the dogs out!
There he is!
Racer and the Jailbird
They're doing 250!
l'll go and see her.
She won't be happy with her time.
Your sister can reaIly race.
Not bad for a chick?
Yeah, and for her age.
Huh, Gigi?
Ready, here she comes!
How is it going?
That's where it blocks.
Yeah.
Fantastic.
ls your sister leaving?
Bibi?
She'll come to the buffet later.
Let's go meet the teams.
Hello.
Leave some for the others.
l'm hungry.
My name's Gino.
Nice to meet you.
Bénédicte.
They caIl you Bibi, right?
Yes? They call me Gigi.
Funny, huh?
Yeah.
We won't hang around.
l'll take you straight back.
My father.
Nice to meet you. Gino.
One of Nardo's clients.
l'm in the car import-export business.
Are you now?
Don't dawdle.
Are you Flemish?
Half and half. My father's
from Brussels. l can't help it.
Shall we sit down?
Can l ask you a question?
Yes.
Do you have a boyfriend?
What?
Are you seeing anyone?
Why?
l'm curious.
lf you're with someone,
l promise l'lI leave you alone.
A real gentleman.
So if l have a boyfriend,
you'lI beat it?
l promise.
For good?
Yeah. l swear.
l don't have a boyfriend.
For real?
You're sure?
Yes.
So we can see each other again.
OK.
In two weeks?
Two weeks?
Got to divorce your wife?
No, l have to go abroad.
Car stuff.
See you in two weeks then?
Yes, great.
No flowers.
We shake the box, hear something inside.
We wonder what it is.
We open it
and there's a parrot in there.
A big parrot.
Green, yellow, from the islands.
We thought: "There's money here.
There was an address on it.
So Gigi and me
go to see the old man.
The guy was so happy:
"O, my parrot!
We say: "It must be worth something.
And he gives us 100 francs.
We were street kids,
but we knew it was worth more than that.
And Gigi starts to get riled:
"100 francs?
He grabs the bird.
He says:
"Your money or your parrot.
"I don't have any more.
"OK, then.
Go to Africa.
He throws the parrot in the air.
We expected the thing to fly
but... Plop!
lt crashed to the ground,
head first, brains everywhere.
No, wait...
l didn't do it on purpose.
Why was it unconscious?
Tell her.
l was so excited about the money
that l squeezed it too hard.
That's why it fainted.
You have to tell that bit.
Tell her the end.
No, that's the end.
That's the end.
No, don't listen.
Gino felt guilty.
The poor bird's brains
were all over the sidewalk.
He bought a new parrot
with his pocket money.
The guy was moved,
offered Gino coffee.
And when Gino Ieft,
who was waiting behind the door?
Who was waiting for you, Gino?
The cops!
And Gino was sent back to juvie.
You're a great dancer.
l was a dancer at the Lune Rouss e.
D'you know it?
No.
You don't know the Lune Rousse?
No.
lt's a cIub in Antwerp.
A club for boys over 18.
That's where l met Serge.
He was so cute,
he always brought flowers.
l quit after that.
l had no choice before that,
l was broke.
She's always drunk.
You're looking great.
l'll take my jacket off.
A great friend of mine.
She hasn't had it easy.
She was attacked
in a massage saIon,
in Antwerp,
by some assholes.
Real animals.
Hello.
Hello.
Bénédicte.
Nice to meet you, Sandra.
She's a pilot.
A pilot?
Yes.
A racing pilot?
She's into big engines, Sandra.
She drives Gigi.
Who's talking about me?
Her?
l don't believe it! No!
Who put that on?
Gigi, it's your song!
Up you get, Gigi.
lt's been like that
since l was a kid.
lt's never changed.
Never.
l've never been able
to explain why l do what l do.
l can't.
Some people know how to do it.
Not me.
And every time, every time,
people asked me:
"Why did you do that?
l had no answer.
How would I know?
Maybe l was irritated
or something.
"Don't teIl lies, Gino.
And l'd say:
"If you already know the answer,
why are you asking?
Why are you asking?
And every time,
I'd get my ears boxed.
At some point, I thought:
"Gino, stop."
Stop speaking to people.
See how they treat you
when you're honest.
And all of a sudden,
my switch flipped. l quit that.
What l'm saying is that
me and trust...
l don't trust people.
l can't.
Not much or not at all?
Well...
More like not at alI.
You're right.
OK.
You're right. Not at all.
And can you be trusted?
Huh?
Can you be trusted?
You can trust me.
You can.
You have nothing to hide?
No.
Tell me your biggest secret.
l'm a gangster, l rob banks.
Why's your dad staring at me?
Does he know?
No, l haven't told him.
Looking at you how?
Ready, Gino?
Yes.
l'll go and say helIo.
Let's get a drink.
Seen the gray Ferrari?
When l was a kid,
I came here with my parents.
What age?
l was just a kid.
Did you have your mustache?
Yeah, l did.
These cars are reaIly...
Yeah, this place is insane.
AutoworId is world famous.
Remember the banker from Dilbeek?
Yes.
Hi, how are you?
Hello. Pleased to meet you.
My friends.
Serge, Younes.
I'll just have a word with Freddy.
OK.
Mr. Delhany, everything OK?
Fine. Call me Freddy.
Like it?
Yes. That Ferrari is top notch.
l'm more of a Porsche man.
Ah, OK.
How's business?
Booming.
Especially exports.
l know lots of people in cars.
You do?
Smolders? Do you know him?
No, I don't.
Knops, in Vilvoorde?
Yes, l've heard of them.
What am l taIking about?
Knops is in containers.
Yes, of course.
ShaIl we have a drink?
Go ahead. Have fun.
lt's on me.
lf you want a good bank,
come to me.
I don't ask questions,
l protect my clients.
There are two safes. One the state
can nose around in, and another one.
You'll feel at home.
ln Dilbeek?
Yes.
"Where the Flemish are at home.
Yes. Arabs too.
Especially Arabs.
Come whenever you like.
We might pop in.
l've got a headache,
l need coffee.
Couldn't we go to your place
one of these days?
l'm not settled in yet.
lt's a tip.
You don't want me to see it.
What are you hiding there?
Your ex?
No. lt's just a mess.
When l get back, l'll show you.
OK?
When do you get back on Thursday?
Friday, 3 pm.
ls Poland nice?
Not great.
Will you take me, next time?
Sure.
ls that nice?
Would you follow me anywhere?
Of course.
Where do you want to go?
You choose.
l can choose anything?
OK.
l want to go to Buenos Aires.
Not bad.
And you?
Would you follow me?
Of course.
Well, it depends.
On what?
On one thing.
What?
Whether you look back or not.
Give me your keys, pal.
Do as you're toId.
Everyone shut the fuck up!
Get out!
Lock the door
and block all systems!
Don't move!
On the ground!
Everybody on the ground!
Listen up!
We'll be gone in three minutes.
Do as you're toId,
everything will be fine.
Got it?
French or Flemish?
Flemish.
OK, follow me.
Against the wall.
Any appointments at 9?
No, none before 10.
Look at me. Don't worry.
Don't be afraid of my voice.
Look at me and say:
"l'm not worried.
Look at me.
l'm not worried.
WelI done.
Feel better already, huh?
Two more minutes!
One more minute!
Move it!
Let's go!
What are you doing?
Fuck!
Shit!
We're outta here!
Come on, move it!
l had a bit of fun. So what?
lt wasn't necessary!
What're you gonna do? Dock my pay?
What made you lay into him?
l was calming him down.
He was shitting his pants.
Dudes, please!
CaIm down.
lt was just a little slap.
Have you seen your face?
The guy was a stupid racist.
So what? l'm racist too.
No, you're just stupid.
But watch it or I'll beat the shit...
Calm down. Breathe.
We're not kids.
No way, this idiot
had his phone on him!
lt's Bibi.
What do l care about Bibi?
Knock it off, Serge.
Or you can do your own
fucking robberies.
Yeah, do them yourself.
Dirty racist.
Racist.
Are you two ganging up on me?
Ouch! Watch it!
See what you did to me?
lt's just a scratch.
What will l telI Bibi?
That's your problem.
Say you had a fight
with some Poles.
Mr. Delhany, it's not a joke.
We have sand.
How much?
800 tons. ln Seraing.
With the European label.
All above board.
We'lI take a third
of the going price.
Assa, your son is like us.
He builds on sand.
I'm only joking.
Call me at the office.
l'll take the lot.
Done deal.
Fantastic.
Let's eat.
You're a beautiful family.
Thank you, that's kind.
Are you married?
No.
You?
No.
No girlfriend?
No. You?
A girlfriend?
l doubt that.
No. l have a boyfriend.
Been with him long?
Not long.
What does your friend do?
He imports and exports cars.
So, to love.
To love. And children.
Choose your husband carefulIy
because he'll give you children.
Your children.
lsn't that right, Freddy?
Look at our children.
Because our wives had the wisdom
to choose men like us,
we have wonderful children.
To our mothers.
So it's serious?
l was going to tell you. lt's his fault.
OK.
ls it that Gigi guy?
Yes, it's that Gigi guy.
Take it slow.
Why?
You're young and he's...
Like you and Mum.
But it wasn't always easy...
l can't hear you.
Bibi!
Sandra, what're you doing here?
l'm glad to see you.
How are you?
Fine. Been shopping?
What's it for? Let me help you.
For my baIcony.
lt's lucky you're here.
You like gardening. Great!
What are you doing here?
l don't garden.
l'm here for the salesman.
Did you hear about that banker?
No, what banker?
The guy at your party.
Yes?
His bank was robbed.
Really?
Yeah.
l didn't know.
No? And he got beaten up.
That's awful.
He's all disfigured.
Did they catch the guys?
l don't think so.
lt's weird you didn't know.
Don't you and Gigi talk?
Yes, but he's in Poland.
Ah, yes.
With his gang.
With his friends.
Right, l'lI let you
get on with your planting.
Bye, Sandra.
Can l take your trolley?
Sure.
Bye.
See you soon.
Remember that banker,
Nardo's friend?
Yeah.
Did you place money with him?
No. Why?
Didn't you hear?
What?
His bank was robbed.
Really?
lt's awful.
He tried to defend a client
and they beat him up.
Yeah but...
His bank has lousy security.
And he's a real asshole.
So you were lucky.
What d'you mean?
You didn't put your money there.
That's not luck.
l knew his bank was Iousy.
lt was a choice.
What are you doing?
Take it easy, dammit.
Look where you're going.
So you had a fight?
What? Yeah.
The Poles punch
when they've had a few.
And weren't your friends there?
Yes, they were there.
Are they in cars, too?
No.
They were there for pleasure.
Ah, for pleasure.
Fuck!
Put your foot down.
What?
Get a move on.
Are you crazy?
That way.
They'll chase us.
Step on it!
You're crazy!
l'm joking.
PulI over.
Don't worry.
Hello. I'm sorry.
Cut the engine.
Madam...
Do you know how fast
you were driving?
l know, l'm sorry.
Do you have a valid reason?
Sorry.
Papers and lD.
ln the glove compartment.
My fiancé.
Stay where you are.
Could you check her papers?
You OK?
Yes. Why?
Your papers.
You'll get a fine for dangerous driving
and speeding.
Have a good day
and watch your speed
from now on.
So l'm your fiancé now?
What?
l'm your fiancé.
When's the wedding?
You're joking.
No, l'm not. TeIl me the date.
l'lI be there.
You OK?
l'm crazy about you.
Come on, get dressed.
Fantastic! Amazing!
Bénédicte Delhany
takes third pIace...
l don't beIieve it.
We could make 4 million
and you say nothing.
This isn't the place.
What?
Show some respect.
Jeez, am l boring you?
Listen up.
We just hit a bank.
We don't need this now.
Right, Younes?
Remember, in juvie?
You wanted to do hold-ups, right?
We were fourteen.
So what?
The goaI wasn't to live
in Linkebeek with a rich chick.
Should l get a Labrador?
Asshole.
Fucking asshole.
Serge, cool it.
Go get your prayer mat, you.
Are you in or out?
Give me five minutes.
What for?
To think!
About what?
Mike and Eric are in.
We can't do it without you.
I know.
l need to think it over.
Think what over?
You think now?
That's new.
My father wants to speak to you.
l'll be right there.
"I'll be right over.
CaIm down.
l am calm.
You need to get laid, Serge.
Fuck you.
You've drunk enough.
Catch you later.
Yeah.
Everything OK?
Yes.
Serge looks a bit worked up.
lt's nothing.
He's just stressed.
Not from selling cars.
l don't know.
We don't talk about it.
You don't? That's not good.
You have to talk.
Like us, now.
Do you and Bibi talk?
Sure we do.
Talk to her a lot.
She likes that.
She gets it from her mother.
She was like that too.
When I didn't talk to her...
Actually, l want to talk
to you about something.
Go ahead.
l want to marry Bibi.
Good idea.
But you'll have to quit lying.
Stop lying.
l know guys
like you and your pals.
l can see what my daughter
sees in you.
But l'm the dad.
You look like the faithful sort,
so l won't object.
But you have to quit.
You either tell the truth,
or you stop doing
whatever it is that makes you lie.
A man shoulders the load.
You can be a good guy or a bad guy.
That's up to you.
But a real man doesn't Iie.
That's for kids.
Go for it.
You OK?
Hungry?
No.
l want to eat.
Come on.
Five minutes, OK?
l'm looking for Andreï.
Andreï!
Hello, are you Andreï?
Gino?
Yes. Have you got the stuff?
Yes.
But not here. Wait here.
l'll get the key.
l'lI wait in the car.
OK.
Sorry, Bibi.
l have a thing to do.
A load of wheel rims
l can sell for 4000 a set.
lt won't take Iong.
That's OK.
Nice dog, huh?
A killing machine, more like.
Here he comes.
You said earlier
you were sick of your job.
Cars. Are you going to quit?
l have one last trip to do.
A last trip?
Yeah, two days.
Wait in the car.
l'm coming with you.
No, stay in the car.
Afterwards,
we'll have a weekend in Paris.
Just the two of us.
Smile, please.
l'll be two minutes.
And the young lady?
You trust her?
She's my wife. No problem.
Shall we?
OK.
There you are.
lt's all there.
You couIdn't have known
but dammit,
you always saddIe me with losers
who let me down.
This isn't the first time.
I'm sick of your half-baked plans.
You're such an asshole.
You're a pain in the ass!
Fuck you.
Goddam.
What's going on?
We have to bring the operation
forward a week.
Why?
They're gonna start using
explosive cases.
lt has to be next week.
lt's tight.
lt's doable.
No way. The brakes for the Subaru
aren't here yet.
What d'you mean?
What l said. They haven't come.
Fuck it.
l promised Bibi a weekend away.
What is this crap?
Venice can wait, sweetie.
With the dough you're gonna make,
your life wiIl be one long weekend.
Are these the fakes?
Try it.
Of course we shoot first.
lt's what we always do.
We take risks, so do they.
We steal from the rich.
Those jerks know who they work for.
They chose to protect
those bastards.
So they take a risk.
We could die too.
Yeah, l know, but...
Well, then...
You'lI go away some other time.
They've been telling us what to do
all our lives. Do this, do that.
Because we're dumb?
They've always treated us like animals.
Remember Mol?
ln the cesspool.
They left us to rot
for two days.
lf they want animals,
that's what they'll get.
Fuck the others.
Fuck money, fuck the cops,
fuck the law.
Fuck the country, fuck the king, the queen.
We'll fuck them all.
Come on, quit grouching.
Fuck you and your friends!
You folIow each other like puppies.
We push the trip back a week or two.
It's not the end of the world.
lt's not that bad.
Are you scared of your pals?
Are you scared of the truth?
Scared of dogs?
No, l'm not scared of dogs.
Yes, you are.
No, l'm not.
Yes, you're scared of dogs!
Because they're honest
and you're not.
See?
Stay here, Bibi.
You don't understand.
Listen to me.
What?
Are you listening?
You know what it's Iike
to have a family.
l don't have that.
l don't have a family, parents.
l grew up with those guys.
They're my brothers, my family.
l can't just drop them.
Don't you get it?
l promise you one thing.
And l'm not lying.
After this, l'm done. No more crap.
l quit, l swear.
OK.
OK!
What?
Stop talking to me like l'm a kid.
You're the child. You're lying.
l'm going to take a shower.
l want to start over.
l'm sick of it all.
l want to be part of your life,
your family.
Gino.
What are you going to do
with those guys?
Gigi, look at me.
Look at me.
You don't sell cars?
l'm gonna wrap it aIl up.
But what is it?
I feeI like an idiot.
More and more.
l feel like l don't know you.
l don't even know
if your flat exists.
l'll telI you something.
l don't even know why we do
what we do. l don't know.
We've been doing it since we were kids.
lt's fun, exciting.
And we're good at it.
Even though we know the risks.
lt keeps us alive.
A bit like you in your race car...
lt's Iike you. The same thing.
But l've had enough.
You know what we should do?
No.
Go to Argentina.
Buenos Aires.
ShaIl l make you coffee?
No, thanks.
Here.
What's this?
A little surprise.
What's the key for?
That's the surprise.
When will l see it?
When l get back.
OK?
l'm off.
A kiss.
Ciao, bella. See you soon.
Ciao.
l love you.
l love you, l love you.
Love you, too.
See you soon.

Get in!
What're you doing?
Come on!

Goddammit!
Guys, what's happening?
The case exploded.
Younes, stay where you are.
Get a towel.
Calm down, caIm down.
Hold that. Look at me.
Look at me.
The police

As you can see, the road

into which the money transport
has crashed.
The attackers have pulled off
a very spectacular...
Thank you.

Never.

Did he have several phones?
No.
Bénédicte, you can go.
Thanks.
Sorry for the questions

My name's Géraldine.
So long, Géraldine.

Come on out.
The doctor's on his way.
Go ahead.
Follow my finger.
Good.
There.
Hold them like this.
OK, fine.
l think you're OK.
l'll fiIl in the form
and see you at reception.
Thank you.
Where is Miss Delhany?
Here, cubicle 2.
There you are.
You gave me a fright, there.
I'm OK.
You're sure?
Nothing serious?
No, just shaken up.
ls this what they gave you?
You all right?
Yes.
Thanks.
Dad, l'm going to see him.
Gigi?
You still love him?
Yes.
The accused may rise.
Eric Lejeune, 15 years.
Serge Flamand, 15 years.
Gino Vanoirbeek, due to his collaboration
in the investigation,
15 years,
of which 5 suspended.
You can go in.
Ten minutes, no more.
The hearing is adjourned.
Remove the accused.
l love you.
l love you, too.
l'lI be right there.
Hello.
Here's Bibi.
How are you?
Fine, and you?
Looks like it's going well.
This collaboration
was a good idea.
We pay you,
so you're working for us.
Not exactly a 'coIlaboration'.
Just kidding.
But your dad, Freddy,
is rather expensive.
He doesn't give discounts.
Do you Iike your friend
being in prison?
I know your fiancé's friends.
You do?
Good guys. Gino too.
Or is it Gigi? To his friends.
That counts you out.
He needs protection in prison.
What are you talking about?
Leave me alone.
But we can help him.
We'd be pleased to.
Listen.
He says you're a saint
and he'd do anything for you.
Anything.
And you?
Would you do anything for him?
You pay 10% of the costs
of our project.
Talk it over with your father.
l didn't know what to say.
l said yes.
That guy scares me.
l know those men.
They want us under their thumb.
They were looking
for an opportunity.
We'll give them what they want.
l'm sorry.
lt's alI right, sweetie.
Such is life.
lt's not all right.
You're screwing up your life
for a gangster.
That's what he is.
l never should have introduced him to you.
Calm down.
What?
She's like Mum.
She thought about everyone
except herseIf.
She always put you, me, us first.
We know how it ended.
How can you say that?
Because it's true.
You disgust me.
l'm sorry.
It hurts me too.
Me too.
lt hurts me
to see you like this.
Bibi wants us to help him.
So that's what we'll do.
Because we're a family.
We don't run away.
How many minutes?
Five, l think.
Five minutes? And it works?
l hope so.
I hope so too.
Jeez, this is weird.
He'll be about five
when l get out.
Or she.
Yes, right.
Gino!
We're not ready!
Five more minutes.
Are you sure he...
Yeah, l know him. lt's OK.
Bibi?
Yes, l'm here.
How are you?
Fine. You?
Want a beer?
No.
Nardo, wait.
What?
Come here.
What?
l'm going to quit racing.
Really?
Yes.
Because of the accident?
No.
No, it's not that.
lt doesn't excite me anymore.
Maybe l'll get back to it later.
OK.
But you're all right?
Yes.
We're going to have a chiId.
You and Gigi?
Who else, idiot?
You're joking?
No.
lt's the only way
he'll hold it together.
That he'll wait for me.
That way I'll have something too.
l'll get a beer.
l'll be godfather, then?
No.
Godmother.
Fertility: New Possibilities
Prison leave sucks.
Why?
lt's like being in prison.
They shut you in a little room
full of porn mags.
Unbelievable.
Want to know what I did?
No.
Ar-ri-va Gigi l'amoroso...
Let's wait.
l'm happy to be here.
Me too.
l don't beIieve it.
See that dog?
lt's a cocker.
My mum brought me one
when l was a kid.
Cute, huh?
Yes.
Remember that comic "Boule et Bill"?
Back then everyone wanted a cocker.
Dad said: "They're inbred.
Those dogs are crazy.
One day
it was just a little thing -
it bit his finger.
My father lost it completely.
And he beat it to death.
Can you imagine that?
Yet his dogs were real monsters.
They bit everything and everyone.
He'd say: "That's their nature.
They're made to bite."
lmagine.
So to his mind,
some dogs could bite
and others couldn't.
l never understood that.
But what l was going to say
is that the dog's name was Lady.
Pretty, huh?
Cute.
Lady...
lf it's a girl,
we could call her Lady.
Lady, really?
Look at your face! l'm joking.
Promise you're joking.
Come here.
You can go in now.
Me too?
Yes.
Are you mad?
You're out of your mind!
He bit me.
He didn't.
He's crazy!
Did you see what he did?
No use trying to talk to him.
Call the poIice.
Calm down.
Stop that police car over there.
Police!
Let them through.
Hello.
He kicked my dog.
Him?
Yes, him.
Sir?
Let me explain.
He bit me, on the calf.
Stop lying, that's nonsense.
l was just standing there.
CaIm down.
Your papers, pIease, sir.
He needs to control himself.
One moment, please.
Don't move.
He's getting away!
Sir!
HelIo, Bibi?
lt's me. Where are you?
Holy Trinity. OK.
Everything OK, Bibi?
Drive.
What's wrong?
l said drive.
Where were you?
Come on, move.
Gino, look at me.
l'll explain. Just drive.
Please.
Tell me you're joking.
I'm begging you, tell me it's a joke.
Two hours. l leave you alone two hours
and you cause panic!
You're on prison leave.
They'll take everything away from us.
How will you get paroIe?
How can you be so dumb?
You're right. We have to get away.
This is all your fault!
I know.
l know!
We have to get away, right now!
l know people...
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop saying that!
What are you doing?
Gino, don't.
Goddammit.
Gino, get in or l'll run you over.
No one comes here at weekends.
l'll come for you later.
Stay here and don't move, OK?
What are you going to do?
l want to know
if they're looking for us.
No more running away, OK?
And forget Argentina.
l won't go.
Carry on like this
and you can forget babies, forget me.
Need anything?
No, l'm good.
All the cops in Brussels
are looking for you. lt's on the news.
How couId you fuck everything up?
The fucking hormone injections
are exhausting.
The worst is doing it without you.
Forgive me.
What do we do now?
Hand yourself in.
Sandra knows you're here.
What are you talking about?
Don't resist, Gino.
lf you do, l swear on our baby's head,
l'll leave you.
How can you say that?
Please.
Let go of me.
Please, look at me.
l love you.
Don't run, please.
l'm here. lt'lI be all right.
l promise.
l swear.
Why did you do this?
Because l love you.
l'll always be here.
Lie down.
l trust you.
TeIl me what to do.
Lie down.
Are they here?
Lie down, Gino.
Fuck.
lt'll be OK, l swear.
Yes, it'll be all right.
Don't move.
Look at me.
l love you.
l love you, too.
No flowers
Gino, my love...
l'm sorry to have to teIl you Iike this,
but l have some awful news.
l lost the baby afew weeks ago.
Gino?
Please be strong.
l had to have more tests done.
Now my greatest fear
has become a reaIity.
Who are you?
Gino Vanoirbeek's wife.
Who?
He was a client of yours,
a long time ago.
Gigi.
l'm afraid, my Iove.
For what you want,
you need the Gazis,
Albanians.
You know what you're asking?
Yes.
Can you help me or not?
But I have hope, too.
We'll get through this
as we have aIl the rest.
lt's on.
Call this number tomorrow at midday.
Then go to this address.
They'll take you from there.
They've found a malignant tumor
on an ovary.
I am not pregnant with new life,
but with death.
I miss you.
Gino, the warden wants to see you.
Come on, man.
You have to stop
the escape attempts.
You'll be hunted down,
they'll turn up at her place
to pick you up
without harming her.
All that stress for her,
with her cancer and all.
Look at me.
Look at me!
l won't put you in solitary.
And you don't have
to promise me anything.
Do it for her.
Stay here. Try to reach her
by toeing the line.
l'm sorry, sir.
I didn't know what to do.
l'll give a positive assessment
for a visit.
Thank you.
Are you all right, girl?
Are you sick?
Drink a little.
Thank you.
I know, girl.
l heard you being sick.
lt's normal in the early months.
l've had seven children.
Ready?
Come in.
He says you have come humbly.
That you have covered your hair.
That's good, it shows respect.
l want to hear it from you.
What do you want from us?
l want you to help me
get Gino out.
Out of prison?
Yes.
Speak louder.
l want you to help me
get Gino out of prison.
Why did he send you?
He didn't.
He doesn't know. Not yet.
We can't help you.
You'd better go home.
Please.
l'm sorry. The answer is no.
How are you feeling?
You're kidding!
Completely shaved?
You must look like thingy,
that singer who...
The one who did the Prince song.
Yeah, Sinead something...
What was her name again?
O'Connor, right.
I can't wait to see it.
You must look great.
Yes, l'm here.
What's new here?
lt's OK. Same old.
They beat up another pedophiIe.
It happens every day,
nothing special.
We're Iocked up,
like animals in cages.
There's no light
at the end of the tunnel here.
But at the same time,
we mustn't complain.
There's always worse.
There's always worse.
Besides, l'm lucky.
Yes. Why?
Because I've got you.
l'm lucky to have you.
No, my father isn't here.
Come on up.
They told me you were pregnant.
Who said that?
The Albanians you saw yesterday.
They work for me.
They don't decide these things.
lt goes through me first.
That's why l'm here.
l want to know why.
l'm sick.
So l see.
l don't know if I'm going to make it.
l'm sorry to hear that.
l want you to make a plan
to help Gino escape from prison
after my death.
Without him knowing?
It's an aggressive cancer.
l don't know how long l've got,
but it's not looking good.
Wait a second.
lf I understand correctly,
you want him to escape
only if you die?
lf you live, we do nothing?
Find Bibi and you find Gigi.
When the deal is done,
l take 15% of what they ask.
And l'll take the Porsche
as security.
This way.
Follow me.
One moment, please.
Could you lower that, please?
Take off the cuffs.
Not possible.
The cuffs wilI hurt her.
You can't be serious.
It's procedure.
Hey, Bibi.
lt's Gino, wake up.
ls she asleep?
No, she fell into a coma last night.
Weren't you told?
Bibi, wake up.
Bibi, dammit. Wake up.
Could l have a moment alone?
Sorry, Gino.
Goddammit.
Forgive me, Bibi.
Jean, come on out.
Give us a minute.
Take your time.
Hello?
Yes, Nardo, it's me.
Take this.
What is it?
The first part of the plan
to get you out of here.
Listen up.
Your wife paid us
to get you out of here.
She wanted us to help you escape
to Argentina after her death.
lf you didn't believe me,
l was to say:
"No flowers.
Save your questions for after.
Clench your teeth.
We're going
to organize your transfer.
Ready?
You have no idea
why they did this?
No.
l'll have to transfer you.
Come.
Come and eat.
What's aIl this, Gigi?
l don't want to Ieave.
Look, it's all arranged.
Tomorrow, you're on the plane.
l don't want to go.
Understand? l don't want to.
You don't want to?
You have to get to Argentina.
Understood?
You shake hands over there
or we get no money.
Got it?
Esto, Iisten.
She got it wrong.
She thought l wanted to be free,
but alI l wanted was to be with her.
See what l mean?
Going to Argentina
makes no sense anymore.
Do you understand?
OK, come on out.
He doesn't want to?
We'll make you want to go.
Come here.
Come.
Come here.
Good boy.
Wake up.
Can you be trusted?
You can trust me.
You can.
You have nothing to hide?
No.
TeIl me your biggest secre t.
I'm a gangster, I rob banks.
Your turn now.
TeIl me your biggest secre t.
Ready?
I dunno, let's see.
You won't be afraid?
No, l promise.
Go on, tell me.
l'm immortaI.
