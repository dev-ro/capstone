Ken...
please...
Stop!
Ken?
Ken!
It's me!
I'm begging you!
Wake up!
I love you.
Okay, cut.
What do you think?
How many takes?
That was the 42nd.
You're facing death.
Yes.
Were you really scared?
Yes, as if it was...
- for real.
- You were acting, yeah?
Yes.
Not as if, it should
come naturally!
Um, what do you mean...
- come naturally?
- Give me real fear!
The true shiver in your face!
Face! Face!
Wanna know why you look so fake?
Coz your life itself
is utter fake.
You say nothing but lies!
Why don't ya peel off that
lie-infested mask of yours?
You're over the line!
Shut up you idiot!
- This is my show, my work!
- Hey, come on.
You've been talking
back since rehearsal!
Listen! Why don't we take a breather?
Let's take a break!
Can we take thirty, Director?
He's worse than usual today.
- I'm gonna get some fresh air.
- Yeah, okay.
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.
Talk to her.
How're you doing?
What's with him? He's insane.
- No, it's me, I'm a lousy actor.
- Nah.
There's no point
repeating that scene.
Bear with me.
You know, when you attack me...
Do it harder.
Can I come tonight?
I'm dying for a hot bath!
Let's have it together.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Have a seat.
Jesus!
Whopping 42 takes, huh?
I'm so sorry.
Oh, no. Not you, he's insane,
You know this is a real axe?
So damn dangerous.
What now?
The Director wants all the
fake blood on the rooftop.
To the rooftop? What for?
Who knows? Pour it all over
himself to keep him going?
What?
The director is so wound up.
Especially this time.
He's so committed to this film.
- And got into debt as well.
- What! In debt?
- I'm gonna practice by myself.
- There's no need. Don't worry.
Come on, relax.
Sit down.
You're working hard.
Who found this location anyway?
Perfect for a horror film.
The director travelled
all over Japan to find it.
This place's like a
real haunted house.
Funny you should say that.
What?
It's just an urban legend,
like those you find on the net.
On the record,
this place was built
for water filtration.
But the Japanese army used here
for some sort of experimentation.
- Experimentation?
- Human experimentation.
- What do you mean?
- Like... bringing the dead back to life.
You mean...?
- Uncanny, huh?
- What?
- Well, the story doesn't end there.
- What?
Wow, what was that?
What timing! The wind?
- Nao, do you have... any...
- Huh?
- Hobbies?
- Hobbies?
That's a random question.
Let's have some fun here.
Not really a hobby but
I'm learning self-defense.
- Self-defense?
- Yep.
You see,
I work with a lot of
youngsters like you guys.
I teach them sometimes.
- I see.
- I see.
Show me, what if you get...
- attacked like this?
- From the front?
- There...
- Ouch! Aw!
- You go!
- Wow!
How about... from behind?
Oh. Okay grab me
from behind then.
Okay, excuse me then.
Grab!
Pom!
- Wow! You're out!
- Amazing!
- Did you say pom?
- Saying it makes all the difference!
- You slipped out so easily.
- Amazing!
Holy cow! You made me jump.
They painted you, huh?
You can be an actor.
Wanna play a part? I'll film it.
Hey, what's wrong? Hey!
Uh?
Um...
Seen this prop before?
Oh my god.
This looks so real!
Disgusting...
Wow, who made you a zombie?
The director?
What...? He's dead.
I get it! That one is his arm...
Not bad.
Wait a minute, this is some
sort of prank, isn't it?
Come on, the show is over.
You can get your arm out now.
He's got no arm! No arm!
He's dead! He's really dead!
What's this? Gross!
Hey...
can it be...?
No way.
It can't be!
I don't believe it!
This can't be happening!
Director?
What're you doing?
Shooting, obviously.
Don't you know what's happening?
Hey!
- This is filmmaking!
- You're insane!
- True filmmaking!
- No!
Look! There's no fiction, no lies.
This is reality!
We keep rolling!
Don't stop shooting!
- You didn't, did you?
- What?
Oh yes, a great guess!
I threw the blood already.
Blood?
Impossible.
That was just an urban legend!
Hey! What're you talking about?
It was... around
this time last year.
It was a goddamn hot summer!
I was writing the script
of this film day and night.
One day, a rumor spread on the net...
Oi, where're you going?
- I just...
- You just?
- Wait a second, just what?
- Just...
- Huh?
- I'll be right back.
There are monsters out there!
Yeah, I think It's
dangerous to go out!
But, I'm just...
What's your problem, eh?
Just what then?
- Just means... just!
- Yamagoe!
Oh shit, no, no!
Let go! Get off!
Get off!
Keep on shooting!
Keep it rolling!
Wait!
You hurt?
I'm all right.
- Are you all right?
- Yep.
I'm fine, are you all right?
I'm all right.
You hurt?
Oh, no... he just asked...
Oh... yeah.
Um... you...
- Yes. I'm okay.
- That's... yeah.
We know that no one
was hurt, that's great!
No one injured which is amazing!
We're all okay
that's just great!
Right?
It's no use. No
signal around here.
Nao.
What the director said earlier.
Is that the same rumor?
To revive the thing,
chant a spell of blood.
- Huh?
- The rumor...
The thing?
I'll explain later.
Let's get outta here!
- What?
- By the car.
- What about the monsters?
- You got a better idea?
No one will come
to our rescue here!
What's the thing?
What the hell is going
on in this place?
Wha, what the hell...
is... go, going
on in this place?
Oi... it's me! Open the door!
Wait!
I'm alone! There's no monsters!
After three, okay?
One, two...
Action!
Wha... h, holy crap!
This is what I wanted!
Yeah!
Yes, yes! This is great! Yeah!
This is damn good!
- Push the monster this way!
- So damn real!
What the hell! This is
fun-freakin'-tastic!
Serves you right! Freakin' monster.
Damn you!
Oh, yeah. That's the face!
Nailed it!
This'll be a
goddamn sick film...
Run to the car. I'm gonna
freakin' smash them all!
Clear! Keep running!
- There's no key!
- What?
- Who's got it?
- Kasahara?
Kasahara! Damn!
Kasahara!
Kasahara...
Action!
The bag! The key
might be in that bag!
C'mon monster! Get her!
- Chinatsu!
- Get off!
Get the hell out! The
camera is rolling!
Kg!
Nae!
Noooo!
Chinatsu!
Twisted my ankle.
- Where's Nao?
- OK, she's inside.
Nao! It's me, open the door!
- Nao! Open the door!
- Please Nao!
Quick!
- Got the key.
- Wait.
You got bitten?
I'm not sure.
It could be... just a cut.
Nao...
It's okay, I know. Just in case.
- Calm down, Nao.
- I'm calm. I'm dead calm.
No!
Pom!
Help!
Action!
Outta my way!
Stop it!
No! No!
I gotcha!
Stop!
It's okay, just a precaution.
- No!
- It's okay.
- Nao!
- Who the hell are ya?
Aw, aw, aw, it hurts!
Aw! You're gonna break my arm!
I'm serious! Stop her!
Stop the camera!
Don't come near me!
- Go away!
- What?
Run away from me!
Chinatsu!
An axe...
Lucky me.
Kg!
Kg!
Ko?
Oh, no...
You as well?
What's that?
Ko...
please...
Stop!
That's it!
That face! You
nailed it, goddamnit!
Now... the climax! Make
it the last bloody take!
Ko...
please...
Stop!
Ko?
Please Ko! It's me!
I'm begging you!
Wake up!
Ko?
Ko...
please...
Stop!
Please!
I love you.
Oi!
What the hell?
Follow the script!
Hey! Jeez... come on, stop it!
Okay, cut!
One month ago..
Egreh...
Milyfhghatddah!
Yep, okay!
- Okay.
- Was it okay?
- Yes, great face.
- What about my lines?
We don't use them,
just the image.
Oh, I got you.
Next in order, the tears.
Look up please.
What scene is it?
Why am I crying again?
- Rolling!
- Eye drops, okay!
Ready? Action!
Oh, long time no see.
- Can we talk later?
- Yes.
- Mr. Higurashi, was that okay?
- Yep, okay.
- Mr. Higurashi, - Yes.
What's your genre then?
I do reconstruction VTRs a lot.
And karaoke videos,
I do many little things.
What was it again,
your pet phrase?
It goes... I'm...
Fast, cheap but average.
- That's it!
- Sorry.
Sounds good.
I'd say yes.
Really?
Zombie film?
We're starting the Zombie
Channel from this August,
and making a special drama.
Can you elaborate on that?
Whilst shooting of
an indie zombie film,
real zombies attack the crew.
They panic! panic! and fight!
fight! against zombies.
A survival story.
I see.
And, there are two hot features!
Hot features?
One, live broadcasting.
Real time?
It'll go on the air at
I pm for 30 minutes.
- Two, the hotter feature, which is...
- Yes?
One take.
One take? You mean...
With one camera.
One take, no cuts. With one
camera from start to finish.
Making a zombie film
on a live broadcast,
in one take?
It's hot, huh?
Oh dear, oh my...
What an absurd
idea, that's funny.
- Huh?
- What?
We're not kidding.
Dead serious.
What?
What do you think?
Pom!
Self-defense techniques for women No.
42 Pom Slide
Raise your arms up to the sky, '
bend your knees with
a straight back.
And now, you say...
- Pom!
- Out loud. This is the key.
The attacker flinches by pom, '
body down and slip through.
Pom!
Why did they come to you?
No one took the offer,
as it's utter nonsense.
So did you, right?
Eh? Yeah...
I knew it. You don't
have the guts to say no.
I'll be home late.
- How about dinner?
- No.
Hey, Mao...
- I'm off!
- See you later.
What's the new crew like?
Are you off today?
- Yeah.
- Can you spy on her?
What?
I want the real ones.
Your real tears.
Yeah? You shouldn't rely
on a fake thing like this.
Ever cried from anger? I have.
It was the last basketball
match at my school...
Hello, the director said it's
okay to use eye drops here.
Excuse me, but this
is a battlefield.
Battlefield?
She's fighting her own battle.
No place for a mother to cut in.
- But I was told...
- Leave it Mao.
- Okay let's go.
- Director,
- this is important.
- There's no time!
You shouldn't listen
to that old hag!
Old hag? Me?
Sorry about that but
you must unders...
No way, we're leaving.
Wait Madam, please! We
must wrap it today...
So sorry about the old hag.
Can we get back once, please?
So sorry...
In terms of work she's great,
the problem is her personality.
- She doesn't fit in our team.
- Yes, I understand.
- Okay then.
- I'm sorry.
You know... l think...
you should learn to compromise.
As you're leaving home soon,
you must make a living.
I know you care so much
about the details...
Hey, Mao!
Taizo cried out loud on the
roof top of the hospital.
It was the first tears
he shed in his life.
Eye drops, huh?
Taizo Kusokabe,
a lonely entrepreneur...
Can I change it?
Of course you can.
Would you tell your opinion to
the director while shooting?
Well...
Actor Kazuaki Kamiya I would if
necessary for the sake of art.
- You're recording this, right, Mom?
- Yes.
Who's he?
Her current favorite.
Any genre you want
to challenge for?
My next role is a challenge.
I can't reveal too much yet...
Fan I say it? I can?
I'll be blood soaked.
Blood-soaked? A horror movie?
Casting candidates
Actor Kazuaki Kamiya
just wait and see!
Thank you.
First reading room'
I was always interested
in zombie films.
I'm your big fan, I always
wanted to work with you.
Actress: Miss. Aika Matsumoto I'm your b I
gfan, I a I w ays wanted t owork with you.
I'm flattered!
Hey, would you mind doing...?
Sure. Aika's love beam!
Actor: Mr. Kazuaki
Kamiya Love it!
This story deals with the
topic of racism discreetly.
- Yeah, maybe.
- I noticed.
Mr. Manubu Hosoda'
To stop my hands shaking.
Oh, I see.
Mr. Hiroshi Yamanouchi'
- Uh, which part deals with racism?
- Sorry, I'm in my zone right now.
Okay. I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Is this hard water?
Sound: Mr. Shunsuke
Yamagoe Pardon?
I can only drink soft water.
Or I get bad diarrhea.
I've emailed you.
- Oh... I'm sorry.
- I've emailed.
Give me real fear.
The true shiver in your face!
Face! Face!
Director: Daigo Kurooka
I'm sorry I'm late!
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, hi!
What?
I'm sorry my husband is away
and my manager is busy today.
Make-Up: Mrs. Mai Aida I'm sorry my husband
is away and my manager is busy today.
Shall I?
It's fine, she's so quiet.
- This way.
- Yes.
Director: Takayuki Higurashi
You're facing death.
Yes.
Were you really scared?
Yes as if it was for real.
You were acting, yeah?
Yes.
Yes.
Not as if, it should
come naturally.
Um, what do you
mean come naturally?
The true shiver in your face!
Face! Face!
You're over the...
You're over the line!
Why don't we take a breather?
Take a break?
Okay, let's stop right here!
And... this won't
be good either.
Covered in vomit?
I'd like to challenge myself
but, my agency won't let me.
Vomit on a pop star? No!
Obviously it won't
be real vomit.
- Yes I know.
- Okay,
No vomit.
I'm sorry, I don't mind doing
it but my agency does...
I understand.
That's great!
Okay.
- May I?
- Yes.
The AD zombie axes
the Make-Up, right?
- Yes.
- Can a zombie use an axe?
Um... pardon?
Zombies have no will, using
an axe means he has will, yes?
Well, zombies have many types,
- so it can be possible...
- Am I talking to you?
Okay-.
- Let me think about it.
- Yes, please.
What's the matter?
Say peek-a-boo!
And they're having
chat drinking coffee.
Then the first zombie,
the AD zombie comes in.
You can fling yourself in, then
those three guys get panicked.
Next, comes the DOP
zombie, Mr. Hosoda.
Again, you just go for it. Make them
feel twice as panicky as before.
- Taniguchi!
- Yeah?
When the zombies appear,
wouldn't it be great if
you vigorously zoom
in and out like this?
What a cheesy idea.
As it's cheesy it'll look cool!
Whoosh! Whoosh!
I don't get it.
I won't do it.
Are you okay?
One take using a
hand-held will kill me.
I'm good with hand-held!
I've already told you,
you're not ready for this.
- I've studied the script inside out!
- No.
We practiced the
Pom Sliding before.
Here, you'll learn
a variation of it.
- Hey, Mom.
- Yeah?
- Won't you start again?
- What?
- Acting.
- Huh?
I'm leaving home soon,
- do something you like.
- You gotta be joking.
You love reading his scripts.
While killing time.
Killing time, huh?
Pom and what!
- What's this for?
- Huh?
Defending what from who?
Another time killer. A hobby.
Self-defense isn't a hobby.
To be honest, I'm
running out of hobbies.
You get bored too easily.
You did yoga, ballroom
dancing, and Hawaiian dancing.
- Then self-defense?
- Well, I'm in a process of
discovering something that
I can devote myself to.
Isn't that acting?
Oh, that...
I devote myself too much.
Many good actors are like
you, it's not a bad thing.
- You should try again...
- You don't know what you're saying.
- Don't you wanna try again?
- Forget about it, okay?
He's gonna direct a drama.
Oh, really?
- A rare occasion.
- I know.
Guess what? Kazuaki Kamiya...
He's in it.
What?
Nao, calm down.
I'm calm.
- I'm dead calm.
- Nao!
AD zombie, from behind!
Snatch the axe, slam it down,
and stuck on her head. Okay cut!
Still not convinced?
Some zombies fire
guns these days.
- You think too much.
- Let me think.
Exactly.
This is one of my few good
scenes in the film though.
I'll convince him.
Please do.
- Hey.
- Yes?
- The first crying scene...
- Yes.
Can I use eye drops?
Can't you cry for real?
Well, I think I can, but
it's more assuring, right?
We can't retake so
better that way.
- Okay then.
- That's great!
Are there toilets
in the building?
We're going to rent
some portaloos.
I need to know how
many and where, asap.
I understand.
I emailed as well.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I emailed.
I'm sorry.
Did you know?
- I'm sorry.
- I said, did you know?
Hey, crouch down
a bit, will you?
Oh yeah, stay down.
That's good. Uh-huh.
Many strong characters, huh?
You can talk, Hosoda!
Sorry about what I did.
I'm not drinking.
Really?
Until the shooting is done.
Are you sure?
It's a disgusting habit.
- Who's this?
- My daughter.
My will-power charm,
when my hands shakes.
My bad habit
is causing me to
lose my daughter.
What?
Last year,
she agreed to meet me one day.
I got really nervous on the
clay, started gulping down.
- Oh, no!
- I passed out,
- so I didn't make it.
- That's ridiculous!
Ridiculous indeed!
That's my life.
Fun, though.
I wanted to make
her proud of me.
It's not easy.
I agree.
Hey, Hosoda...
No need to cry about it.
Is it that hard?
What's up?
Can I ask you a favor?
What is it?
Well...
- Morning.
- Good morning!
- Great location!
- Right?
Hot water, please?
- Gonna start.
- Yep.
- Going up!
- Yep.
How's does it look?
Not bad. It'll work.
- Keep hold of it!
- Okay.
We push in from the
distance like this.
- Tilting a bit?
- Yes.
Sorry for the intrusion.
Oh no, she wanted
to see his work?
That's right.
I heard you want
to be a director?
Yes, she does.
Like father, like daughter.
Children grow up
watching their parents.
Get out of the way!
Yes, indeed.
Don't worry about minor
mistakes, keep going.
The camera won't
stop till the end.
Unless something goes wrong.
So please be careful,
watch what you're doing.
Look, from the
handsome producer.
- Thank you.
- Where from?
Good sake from Niigata.
- Let's drink later.
- Later.
Hide it for now.
Yomagoe's bottle'
Hey, have Kurooka
and Soda arrived?
- Stuck in the traffic.
- No calls?
- Won't be long.
- Call them again.
Higurashi.
- An accident?
- Yes.
Anyone hurt?
Not badly, it was
a minor collision.
They came in the same car?
Isn't that obvious?
- Having an affair?
- Yeah!
- Go and check the rest.
- Okay.
How's it going?
We have to cancel them.
- Is the show cancelled?
- No way.
- Work something out.
- How?
What's the time?
I I am, two hours to go.
Can't you rewrite?
It's one take, no cuts!
Not a chance.
Then we find substitutes.
It takes 2 hours to get here.
- No one will make it in time.
- Anyway,
we can't cancel the show.
Higurashi?
Are you serious?
I did some acting
in high-school.
- Just a sec, wait!
- Who else is there?
Who'd fit the age, gender, and
knows the script other than me?
Yes.
- I agree.
- But...
Hold on! Who will play
the make-up artist then?
Huh?
She used to be an actor.
- Hey...
- Also,
she secretly reads his scripts.
Do you know the lines?
- Almost. I've read it over 100 times.
- What?
But I can't...
You've got the role.
Excuse me.
- Definitely not!
- Why?
You've no idea what Mom was like!
I suffered so much from it!
I shouldn't do it.
Who else is there?
Not Mom, definitely not!
No, I shouldn't do it.
No way. I really
shouldn't do it.
Please to meet you!
It should be cancelled.
For the sake of art...
It's... a TV show
before it's art.
The viewers are waiting for us.
We must broadcast the show.
- So please!
- Even the TV show, my...
You already know this but let
me tell you, this is your show.
You are the star here.
It's gonna be great.
I promise.
What's wrong?
I'm just...
I'll be right back.
- Are you okay?
- Not a chance.
I'm sorry.
I'm fine, it's funny a
director playing a director.
Oh, don't go easy on
me, you are too kind.
- Okay then.
- That's great!
Listen everyone,
we are about to start.
Just to clarify, it'll be
one long take, one camera.
Broadcasting live.
Once the camera starts
rolling we can't turn back.
Let's make it work!
Count down from 10 seconds,
nine, eight, seven...
six, five, four, three, two...
All right, here we go!
I'm counting on you!
Ken, please...
Wake up!
I love you..
Cut.
What do you think?
How many takes?
That was the 42nd.
You're facing death.
Yes.
Were you really scared?
Nice one Director, he can act.
Not as if, it should
come naturally.
Um, what do you mean...
Give me real fear!
The true shiver in your face!
Face! Face!
Wanna know why you look so fake?
Coz your life itself
is utter fake.
You say nothing but lies!
Why don't yo pee! that
hex-infested mask of yours?
- He's improvising.
- What?
Shut up you idiot!
This is my film, my work!
You've talked back
since rehearsal!
Why don't we take a breather?
- Great expression.
- I know,
she acts from her heart.
- Stay away.
- Director.
I'm sorry, I went full throttle.
Sorry. Stay out of their way!
Hosoda's not here.
One minute to his cue.
What the hell...
what's going on?
Hosoda!
Hosoda, Hosoda!
Stinks of booze.
Get some placards.
I can't believe it!
Uncanny, huh?
- Well, the story doesn't end there.
- What?
Here's a problem,
keep improvising!
Wow! What was that?
What timing. The wind?
Nao, do you have any...
- hobbies?
- Hobbies?
- Hobbies.
- That's a random question.
Let's have some fun here.
Not really a hobby but
I'm learning self-defense.
- Self-defense?
- Yep.
Pom!
- Wow! You're out!
- Amazing!
Are they crazy or what?
- You slipped out so easily.
- Amazing!
Director, what's next?
Holy cow!
You made me jump.
They painted you, huh?
You can be an actor.
Wanna play a part?
I'll film it.
Hey, what's wrong?
Hey!
What was that liquid?
Can you wipe my face?
- No wipes?
- No.
What's this? Gross!
So realistic.
That is the key here.
Hosoda!
- Is it starting?
- It's started!
Your cue, Higurashi!
Where're you going?
Your cue's next!
It was around this time last year.
It was a goddamn hot summer!
I was writing the script
of this film day and night.
One day, a rumor spread on the net...
Oi, where're you going?
- I just...
- You just?
- Wait a second, just what?
- just...
Where are we at?
Nowhere. What the...
There are monsters out there!
Yeah, I think it's
dangerous to go out!
- They're improvising.
- For real?
What's your problem...
Oh, crap.
Yamagoe!
- The name.
- Stop him!
Oh, crap, no, no!
Another one gone.
I'm getting excited!
- You got the card ready?
- Yes!
Please wait a moment..
Keep on rolling!
Don't stop shooting!
Where's he looking?
What's wrong with you, Yamagoe?
It's coming out!
What is it?
Poop...
That'll be a blooper.
- Are you all right?
- Yep.
I'm fine, are you all right?
They're going on and on...
Can't you continue?
Not without Yamagoe!
Let's put the card up.
Bring Yamagoe back as a
zombie, back to page I7!
Woman! Look!
From page 15, row 15
here, to page 16, row 11,
jump to this line,
hurry up, Woman!
- Where?
- We good?
- Row 11, here. Here, idiot!
- Kind of.
Old man! Decision, now!
- Um... let's do it.
- Woman, placard!
We're all okay,
that's just great!
Fiddle with a cell, jump
to 'what's going on?'
Bring Yamagoe back as zombie!
It's no use. No
signal around here.
Sorry, toilet's too far away.
It's okay...
- Do it now, no time to wait!
- What?
Stop crying! Hurry up!
Yes.
Oi, where's Yamagoe's head?
Head anyone?
- Woman!
- Found it? Okay, throw!
Have you seen Hosoda?
- Grandpa!
- Starting?
Get the hell up! You!
Take over here.
Let's nail the rest of it!
Who's that?
Action!
This is what I wanted!
Hell yeah!
Push the monster this way!
This is fun-freakin'-tastic!
Serves you right! Freakin' monster.
Damn you!
Oh, yeah. That's the face!
Nailed it!
This'll be a
goddamn sick film...
Run to the car. I'm gonna
freakin' smash them all!
This way!
- There's no key!
- Who's got it?
- Kasahara?
- Kasahara! Damn!
Kasahara!
- Action!
- The key might be in that bag!
C'mon monster! Get her!
Get the hell out! The
camera is rolling!
What?
Huh? What the hell is this?
Yep, it's moving!
One after another...
Wow! Cheesy that so cool!
DOP's changed?
What's going on?
- Y, your cue...
- You hit me!
- Let's go.
- No one hit me before!
He said it's your
damn cue, brat!
You heard, move your ass!
Chop chop!
- You okay?
- Huh?
- Calm down.
- I'm calm. I'm dead calm.
Your Mom's great.
- Never seen before.
- Why did she quit?
She loses herself in her roles.
She ignores her lines.
One time she broke a
star's arm while filming.
Then she stopped acting,
more like she had to stop?
- One hella actor, huh?
- Hmm...
Will she be okay?
Nao...
It's okay, I know.
just in case..
- Calm down, Nao.
- I'm calm. I'm dead calm.
No!
Pom!
She's ignoring the script!
Zombie, stop her!
What? I don't get it!
Calm down, Mrs...
Help!
Action!
Outta my way!
Don't worry about me, you
gotta stop her, please!
I gotcha!
- No!
- It's okay.
Who the hell are ya?
Aw! You're gonna break my arm!
Stop her! Stop the camera!
Pom!
Pom!
You! Damn! Jack ass!
Sorry dear.
Take this! Jack ass! Take this!
- Isn't it too long?
- Huh?
Thank god.
- Go away!
- What?
Run away from me'.'!
Chinatsu!
- Thanks.
- What did I do?
Can't think of anything anymore.
- Better that way.
- Director,
we need an axe for
the last scene.
- Let her pick it up!
- Eh?
- Doesn't matter, go!
- Yes!
Pick up an axe outside!
An axe...
Lucky me.
- No crane.
- What?
It's broken.
Change the approach.
- Need to push up 4 m.
- Why?
- The blood drawing, the climax.
- Huh?
The spell revived the zombies.
It's on the script!
Hmm... let's cut that scene.
- Hold on.
- No time.
- 5 minutes left.
- And?
- We must end with that scene.
- I say no need.
I say we freakin' do!
Who, you?
I'm sorry.
I lost my temper.
Mr. Higurashi,
this is a TV show, not art.
Just finish the show.
Your 'average' will do.
I... understand!
Uh... no crane shot. We pull
out from the foot of the girl...
then the credits. Yep, let
the DOP know, will you?
Wait!
How many of you are free now?
Ko?
Oh, no...
You as well?
What's that?
What's that?
- Crane.
- Huh?
Ko...
please...
- Stop!
- That's it!
That face! You
nailed it goddamnit!
Now the climax! Make it
the last bloody take!
Ko...
please...
Stop!
Please Ko! It's me!
I'm begging you!
Wake up!
Ko...
please...
Stop!
Please!
I love you.
What the hell?
Follow the script!
What the hell? Let me finish!
- Well done, beautiful tears!
- Huh?
This is it, the climax!
15 seconds to the end..
Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three,
two, one...
Okay, cut!
I was worried how
things would go
but the show went well without any trouble.
Thanks a lot!
We're gonna get busy, right?
Drink anyone?
Let's do it.
Ready...
