Sit on my face, 
and tell me that you love me 
I'll sit on your face 
and tell you I love you, too.
I love to hear you oralize 
When I'm between your thighs 
You blow me away 
Sit on my face 
and let my lips embrace you 
I'll sit on your face 
and then I'll love you truly. 
Life can be fine if we're both 69 
If we sit on our faces
 at losses of places and play 
'Till we're blown away 
Hello, good evening and welcome
 to the Ronald Reagan Memorial Bowl, 
here in the pretty little
 L.A. suburb of Hollywood. 
Well, we're about to go in all for wrestling,
 brought to you tonight, 
ladies and gentlemen,
 by the makers of Scum, 
the world's first ever combined
 hair oil, foot ointment, and salad dressing. 
And the makers of Titan,
 the novelty nuclear missile! 
You never know when it'll go off! 
Surprise your friends,
 amuse your enemies,
start the party with a bang! 
Introducing, ladies and gentlemen,
 tonight, 
all the way from a mudwrestling tour
 of the OPEC countries...
in the red corner: 
Colin "Bomber" Harris!...
and, ladies and gentlemen,
 in the blue corner...
all the way from a mudwrestling tour
 of the OPEC countries...
Colin "Bomber" Harris! 
Well, now, ladies and gentlemen,
 this is the first time 
that Colin "Bomber" Harris
 has met himself. 
A few formalities now, 
any moment we're out, 
we'll be ready 
for the start of Round One. 
There goes the bell! 
Colin moves to
 the middle of the ring there, 
he's looking for an opening,
 going for the handhold... 
He's got it! 
Into the headsqueeze... 
A headsqueeze there... 
A favorite... 
...a favorite move of Colin's... 
...flying there... 
...and already Colin is... 
working on that weak left knee of his! 
A half nelson...
a half nelson and a Philadelphia Hamilton 
and Colin bit himself on purpose there, 
and he has been given
 a public warning by the referee, 
and Colin did not like
 that one little bit! 
Double overhead nostril... 
...backkick and into the,
 ah, Boston crayfish, 
no, it's a crawlfish, 
or is it a longestine, no, it's a longestine!
A lovely move there! 
He's caught himself by surprise
and this is the first fall 
to Colin "Bomber" Harris! 
Swell! A lovely move there! 
And Colin must be
pretty pleased with himself 
having put himself up with that one! 
A strawberry whip, 
a vanilla whip, a chocolate whip...
there it is, 
Colin's most famous hold: 
the one-neck-over-shoulder-Gerry Ford 
and Colin's in real trouble! 
He's just made it to the rope...
just a little lucky there... 
...and there it is, a double Eydie Gorm
 should be able to twist...
and he does...
but he's looking pretty groggy...
and I think he's caught himself. 
Colin "Bomber" Harris has
 knocked himself out 
and so he is the winner 
and he goes on next week
 to meet himself in the final! 
Never be rude to an Arab 
An Israeli or Saudi or Jew 
Never be rude to an Irishman 
No matter what you do 
Never pull fun at a nigger 
A Spic or a Wop or a Kraut 
And never poke fun at a...
Michelangelo to see you,
 your Holiness. 
Who? 
Michelangelo, the famous renaissance
artist whose best known works include 
the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel,
 and the celebrated statue of David. 
Ah. Very well... 
In 1514 he returned 
to Florence and de... 
All right, that's enough, 
that's enough, they've got it now! 
Good evening, your Holiness. 
Evening, Michelangelo. 
I want to have a word with you 
about this painting of yours,
 "The Last Supper." 
Oh, yeah? 
I'm not happy about it. 
Oh, dear. 
It took me hours. 
Not happy at all. 
Is it the jello you don't like? 
No. 
Ah, no, I know, they do have
 a bit of colour, don't they? 
Oh, I know, you don't like
 the kangaroo? 
What kangaroo? 
No problem, 
I'll paint him out. 
I never saw a kangaroo! 
Uuh...he's right in the back.
 I'll paint him out! 
No sweat, I'll make him into a disciple. 
Aah. 
All right? 
That's the problem. 
What is? 
The disciples. 
Are they too Jewish?
I made Judas the most Jewish. 
No, it's just that 
there are twenty-eight of them. 
Oh, well, 
another one will never matter, 
I'll make the kangaroo
 into another one. 
No, that's not the point. 
All right. I'll lose the kangaroo. 
Be honest,I wasn't perfectly happy with it. 
That's not the point. 
There are twenty-eight disciples! 
Too many? 
Well, of course it's too many! 
Yeah, I know that, but I wanted to give
 the impression of a real last supper. 
You know, not just any old last supper.
 Not like a last meal or a final snack. 
But you know, 
I wanted to give the impression
of a real mother of a blow-out,
 you know? 
There were only 
twelve disciples at the last supper. 
Well, maybe some of 
the others came along afterw... 
There were only twelve altogether. 
Well, maybe some of their friends
 came by, you know? 
Look! There were just twelve disciples
 and our Lord at the last supper. 
The Bible clearly says so. 
- No friends? 
- No friends. 
- Waiters?
 - No 
- Cabaret?
 - No!
You see, I like them, 
they help to flesh out the scene, 
I could lose a few, 
you know I could... 
Look! There were only
 twelve disciples at... 
I've got it! I've got it!
 We'll call it "The Last But One Supper"! 
What? 
Well there must have been one, 
if there was a last supper, 
there must have been a one before that,
so this, is the "Penultimate Supper"! 
The Bible doesn't say 
how many people were there, does it? 
No, but... 
Well there you are, then! 
Look! The last supper is a significant
event in the life of our Lord, 
the penultimate supper was not!
Even if they had a conjurer
 and a mariachi band. 
Now, a last supper I commissioned
from you, and a last supper I want! 
With twelve disciples
 and one Christ! 
One?! 
Yes one! Now will you please tell me 
what in God's name possessed you 
to paint this 
with three Christs in it? 
It works, mate! 
Works? 
Yeah! It looks great! 
The fat one balances the two skinny ones. 
There was only one Redeemer! 
Ah, I know that, we all know that,
 what about a bit of artistic license? 
A one Messiah is what I want! 
I'll tell you what you want, mate!
You want a bloody photographer!
 That's you want. 
Not a bloody creative artist
 to crease you up... 
I'll tell you what I want!
I want a last supper
with one Christ, twelve disciples,
no kangaroos, no trampoline acts, 
by Thursday lunch,
 or you don't get paid! 
Bloody fascist! 
Look! I'm the bloody pope, I am!
May not know much about art,
 but I know what I like!
Never be rude to a polack...
Hello, and welcome to Munich,
 for the 27th Silly Olympiad,
an event held traditionally 
every 3.7 years, 
which this year has 
brought together competitors 
from over 4 million 
different countries. 
And here we are at the start 
of the first event of the afternoon: 
the second semifinal
 of the 100 yards
 for people
 with no sense of direction.
Aah, i'll just give you 
the competitors:
Lane One:
 Kolomovski of Poland;
Lane Two: 
Zatapatique of France; 
Lane Three: 
Gropovich of the United States,
next to him: 
Drabble of Trinidad, 
next to him: 
Fernandez of Spain, 
and in the outside lane: 
Bormann of Brazil! 
Get set! 
Well, that was fun, wasn't it? 
And now, over to the other end of the stadium. 
And here they're just waiting for 
the start of the 1500 meters for the deaf.
And they're on the starter's orders. 
Well, we'll be coming back 
the moment there's any action. 
And now over to the swimming. 
And you join us here 
at the Bundesabsurd pool
 just in time to see the start 
of the 200 meters freestyle
 for non-swimmers. 
Watch for the
 top Australian champion 
Ron Barnett in the second lane. 
Well, we'll be 
bringing you back here 
the moment they start 
fishing the corpses up.
And now over to the Hansklein
 for the start of the 
marathon for incontinents. 
Well, we put in for this event
44 competitors
 from 29 different countries, 
all of them with the most 
superbly weak bladders. 
Not a tight slinter in sight. 
Ready to embark, nevertheless, 
on the world's longest race 
and they're just aching to go! 
On your marks! Get set! 
And they're off! 
They're off! Well... 
Well, back at the 1500 meters 
and the starter's putting up
 a magnificent show! 
We've had scattered random fire, 
fuselage firing. 
It's enough to make you 
chew your own foot off! 
And now the high jump! 
Katerina Ovelenskij, 
Soviet Union! 
But what a jump! 
What a jump! 
That got to be a record! 
And here we are at the 
3000 meter steeplechase 
for people who think
 they're chickens! 
There's Samuelsson 
of the United States, 
and over there is Klaus 
of East Germany! 
He's been there for 
the last three olympics.
There's the leader, 
Abe Seagull of Canada
 Very good start 
wait to the water jump,
and has now gone loopy. 
Now we are back with the marathon 
for incontinents once again. 
There's Polinski 
of Poland in the lead, 
and-and now Brewer
 of Australia is taking over!
And so now it is Alvarez of Cuba,
 followed by the Norwegian Borg. 
Now it's Blankievic, 
Blankievic from Yugoslavia
Well, well, these must be 
some of the weakest bladders ever
 to represent their country! 
And now, let's have a look back 
at what's going on down on stage!
Good evening, ladies and bruces! 
- Hello, Bruce. 
- Hello, Bruce. 
- Hello, Bruce. 
- Hey, Bruce. 
What's all this lot, Bruce? 
It's very nice to be here
 at the Hollywood Bowl this evening!
We're all philosophy professors 
from the University of 
Wooloomooloo, Australia! 
Hey, Australia, Australia, 
Australia! God love ya! 
I teach Hegelian philosophy, 
Bruce here teaches 
Aristotolean philosophy, 
and Bruce here is in charge
 of the sheep dip. 
Bloody difficult work, 
I tell ya! 
I'll tell you what is thirsty work
 watching this garn of human. 
Bruce, why don't you
 just stick out
a few of these little 
free examples from your... 
All right! Now, the reason 
we do this, ladies and bruces, 
is frankly over here 
we find your American beer 
is a little like making love in a canoe! 
Making love in a canoe? 
It's fucking close to water! 
Well now, we're going to try 
and raise the tone a little here 
by singing a nice 
intellectual song for those 
two or three of you
 in the audience... 
Right! 
...who understand these things. 
So, here we go! 
Immanuel Kant was a real pissant 
Who was very rarely stable 
Heidegger, Heidegger was a boozy beggar 
Who could think you under the table 
David Hume could out-consume 
Schopenhauer and Hegel 
And Wittgenstein was a beery swine 
Who was just as sloshed as Schlegel 
There's nothing Nietszche couldn't teach ya 
'Bout the raising of the wrist 
Socrates himself was permanently pissed 
How do you like that? All right! 
Let's hold it a second. 
I can see some of these bruces are 
in a bit of a playful mood tonight. 
- Ain't that, Bruce? 
 - Yeah, Bruce. 
Some of the ones that don't
 have straws up their nose. 
Anyway, why don't we 
do something rather... 
Why don't we get 
some of these guys 
to sing along with us? 
Ok, I've got the words somewhere. 
Right! Ready! 
Immanuel Kant was a real pissant 
Who was very rarely stable 
Heidegger, Heidegger was a boozy... 
They're a typical Hollywood audience! 
All the kids are on drugs, 
and all the adults are on roller skates! 
Have we got any...
have we got anything bigger 
to put the words up for these 
rather shortsighted people? 
This is Bruce from 
the Biology Department. 
All right. Okay, here we go. 
Immanuel Kant was a real pissant 
Who was very rarely stable 
- Come on! 
Heidegger, Heidegger was a boozy beggar 
Who could take you under the table 
David Hume could out-consume 
Schopenhauer and Hegel 
And Wittgenstein was a beery swine 
Who was just as sloshed as Schlegel 
There's nothing Nietszche couldn't teach ya 
'Bout the raising of the wrist 
Socrates himself was permanently pissed 
John Stuart Mill of his own free will 
On half a pint of shandy was particularly ill 
Plato they say could stick it away 
Half a crate of whiskey every day 
Aristotle, Aristotle was a buggar for the bottle 
Hobbes was fond of his Dram 
And Rene Descartes was a drunken fart 
"I drink, therefore I am !" 
Yes Socrates himself is particularly missed 
A lovely little thinker 
But a bugger when he's pissed.
Good morning. 
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting,
but I'm afraid my walk has become
rather silly over these months, 
so it takes so long 
to get to the office. 
Now,uhm, what was it again? 
Uh, well sir,
 I-I-I I have got a silly walk 
and I'd like to obtain government
 backing to help me develop it. 
I see. Well, may I see 
this silly walk of yours? 
Oh, yes, certainly. 
Yes, I see, 
tha-tha-that's it, is it? 
Ah, well, yes, that's it. 
Yes, yes, yes. 
It's not particularly silly, is it? 
Well, ah-ah... 
I mean, the left leg isn't silly at all 
and the right leg merely does
 a four dare O'Brian half turn 
every alternate step. 
Yes, but I feel with a federal grant
 I could make it a lot more silly. 
Mr. Stagback, the very real 
problem is what I find out. 
You see, 
there's defense, education, housing, 
health, social security, silly walks. 
They're all supposed 
to get the same. 
But last year the government
 spent less on Silly Walks 
than they did on
 industrial reorganisation. 
We're supposed to get
 348 millions pounds a year 
to cover our entire 
Silly Walks proposal. 
- Coffee? 
 - Yes, please. 
Hello, Mrs. Twolumps, could we have 
two cups of coffee, please. 
Yes, Mr. Teabag. 
Mad as a hatter. 
You see, 
the Israelis they have a man 
who can take his own left leg off
 and swallow it with every alternate step, 
whereas the Japanese, 
cunning electronically obsessed little... 
Yes, thank you, 
Mrs. Twolumps. 
You're...you're really interested
 in silly walks, aren't you? 
Right there! 
Right, well,
 take a look at this!
Ooh, that bit of a morning 
in the high court! 
Oh, oh! 
Oh, I could stamp 
my little feet 
at the way those counsels 
are carrying on. 
Oh, don't tell me, love. 
Oh, dear, 
objection here, objection there. 
And that nice policeman 
giving his evidence so well! 
- Oh, ah. 
- Beautiful speaking voice. 
And what a body! 
- Oh, yeah.
 - Oh, yeah. Ooh, ah. 
Well, after a bit 
all I could do was bang me gavel. 
You what, love? 
- I banged me gavel!
- Oh, get away! 
- I did! 
 - Ooh! 
- I did my "silence in court" bit.
 - Oh. 
If looks could have killed, 
that prosecuting counsel 
would have been in for thirty years. 
- Hum-hum! 
- How did your summing-up go? 
Uh, well, I did my box voice, you know,
 "what the jury must understand", 
and they loved it! 
 - Ah. 
I could see that little curly-headed
 foreman of the jury eyeing me! 
- Really?
 - Oh, yeah. Cheating devil. 
I finished up with, 
I got really strict: 
"The actions of these vicious men 
are a violent state upon the community 
and the four pounds of the law
 is scarcely sufficient 
to deal with their ghastly crimes!" 
- Oh, yeah? 
And I waggled me wig! Whoaaoha! 
- You waggled you what? 
- I waggled me wig! 
Really? 
- Ah, the only thing I waggled!
- Ooh... 
- Ever so slightly, stood in effect.
- Ooh! 
Anyway, I gave him three years. 
Merely took ten minutes. 
Ooh...well, as I said to Melvin Belly
 the other day, you know: 
"You can put it 
in the hand of your attorneys, 
but it'll never 
stand up in court!"
Good evening. 
Tonight on World Forum
 we are deeply privileged 
to have with us Karl Marx, 
the founder of modern socialism 
and author of
 the Communist Manifesto, 
Vladimir Ilitch Ulyanov,
 better known to the world as Lenin, 
leader of the Russian Revolution,
writer, statesman, 
and father of modern socialism, 
Che Guevara, 
the Bolivian guerilla leader, 
and Mao Tse-tung, 
chairman of the Chinese
 Communist Party since 1949. 
And the first question
 is for you, Karl Marx. 
"The Hammers." 
"The Hammers" is the nickname
 of what English football team? 
"The Hammers." No? 
Well, bad luck, Karl. 
It is, in fact, 
West Ham United. 
Now, Che Guevara.
 Che... 
Coventry City last won 
the English football cup in what year? 
No? I can tell no further question.
 Anybody else? 
Coventry City last won
 the English Football Cup in what year? 
No, I'm not surprised
 you didn't get that. 
It is in fact a trick question. 
Coventry City have never won 
the English Football Cup. 
So now with the scores all even,
 it's on to Round 2, 
and Lenin, you start at the $10. 
Jerry Lee Lewis has had 
over 17 major solid gold hits
 in the U.S. of A. 
What's the name of the biggest? 
Jerry Lee Lewis' solid gold biggie? 
No? 
Yes, Mao Tse-tung? 
"Great Balls of Fire?" 
Yes, it was indeed!
 Very well challenged. 
Well, now we come on
 to our third round. 
Our contestant tonight
 is Karl Marx 
and our special prize is
 this beautiful lounge suite! 
Uh, Karl has elected
 to answer questions 
on workers' control of factories, 
so here we go 
with question number one. 
You, nervous, Karl?
 Just a little. 
Well, never mind pal, 
have a go! 
The development
 of the industrial proletariat 
is conditioned by 
what other development? 
The development of
 the industrial bourgeoisie. 
Good! Yes, it is indeed!
 Well done, Karl! 
You're on your way
 to a lounge suite! 
Now Karl, number two. 
The struggle of class 
against class 
is a what struggle? 
A political struggle. 
Good! Yes, it is indeed. 
Well done, Karl! 
One final question, 
and that beautiful 
non-materialistic 
lounge suite will be yours! 
Ready, Karl? 
You're a brave man. 
Your final question: 
Who won the English 
Football Cup in 1949? 
Uhuh, the workers' control
 of means of production? 
The-the struggle of 
the urban proletariat? 
Uh, no, it was
 Wolverhampton Wanderers 
who beat Leicester 3-1. 
Oh, shit! 
Get out of here! 
Well, no one leaves 
this show empty-handed, 
so we're gonna
 cut off his hands. 
Well, now it's talent spotting time, 
ladies and gentlemen, 
and please see
 if you can spot any talent 
in our next competitors? 
Will you please
 give a very big hand 
and a warm welcome
 to Carl Weetabix and Rita! 
I'm the urban spaceman, baby, 
I've got speed,
 I've got everything I need 
I'm the urban spaceman, baby, 
I couldn't fly,
 I'm a supersonic guy 
I don't need pleasure, 
I don't feel pain, 
if you were to knock me down,
 I'd just get up again 
I'm the urban spaceman, baby, 
I'm making out, I'm all about 
I wake up every morning 
with a smile upon my face 
My natural exuberance 
spills out all over the place 
I'm the urban spaceman, baby, 
I'm intelligent and clean,
 know what I mean 
I'm the urban spaceman, 
as you lovers second to none, 
it's a lot of fun 
I never let my friends down, 
I could have made a boop 
I'm a glossy magazine, 
an advert on the tube 
I'm the urban spaceman, baby, 
here comes the twist 
I don't exist
- Mr. Hilton?
- Ah, yes. 
You are sole proprietor and owner 
of the Whizzo Chocolate Company?
- I am. 
Constable Parrot and I 
are from the Hygiene Squad... 
- Oh, yes. 
- ...and we'd like to have a word with you 
about your box of chocolates entitled
 "The Whizzo Quality Assortment." 
Ah, good, yes. 
If I may begin at the beginning. 
First, there is the Cherry Fondue. 
Now this is extremely nasty, 
but we can't prosecute you for that! 
Agreed. 
Next we have number four, 
"Crunchy Frog." 
Ah, yes. 
Am I right in thinking 
there's a real frog in here? 
Yes, a little one. 
- Is it cooked? 
- No. 
What? A raw frog? 
We use only the finest baby frogs,
 due picked and flown from Iraq, 
cleansed in the finest quality 
spring water, lightly killed, 
and sealed in a 
milk chocolate envelope, 
and lovingly frosted
 with glucose! 
That's as maybe, 
but it's still a frog! 
What else would it be? 
What! Don't even 
take the bones out? 
If we took the bones out, 
it wouldn't be crunchy, would it? 
Constable Parrot 
ate one of those! 
Would you excuse me 
for a moment, sir? 
Yes. 
Well, it says "Crunchy Frog"
 quite clearly. 
They'll never mind that. 
We have to protect the public. 
People aren't going to think 
there's a real frog in chocolate. 
The superintendent thought 
it was ----. 
They're bound to think 
it's some sort of mock frog. 
Mock frog?! 
We use no artificial preservatives
 or additives of any kind! 
Nevertheless, I advise you to in future
 change the words "Crunchy Frog"
with the legend "Crunchy, raw, 
unboned, real, dead frog" 
if you want to avoid prosecution. 
What about our sales? 
I don't give a damn about your sales.
 We have to protect the public! 
Now, what was this one? 
Number five. 
It was number five, wasn't it? 
Number five: "Ram's Bladder Cup!" 
Now what kind of confection is this? 
We use choices to juicy chunks
of fresh Cornish ram's bladder, 
emptied, steamed,
flavored with sesame seeds, 
whipped into a fondue,
and garnished with larks' vomit! 
- Larks' vomit?
- Correct. 
It doesn't say anything 
down here about larks' vomit! 
Ah, yes, it does, 
on the bottom of the box, 
after monosodium glutamate. 
I hardly think this is good enough!
 It would be more appropriate 
if the box bore a big red label.
 "Warning: Larks' Vomit!" 
Our sales would plummet! 
Well, why don't you move into 
more conventional areas of confectionery,
like praline or lime cream, a very
popular flavor I'm met to understand,
or Strawberry Delight? 
I mean, what's this one? 
"Cockroach Cluster?" 
And this, "Anthrax Ripple?" 
And what's this one, 
"Spring Surprise?" 
Aaah, that's our speciality! 
Covered in darkest, dowdy, smooth chocolate, 
when you pop it in your mouth, 
stainless steel bolts sprint out
and punch straight through both cheeks! 
If people pop a nice chocky
 in their mouth 
they don't expect to get
 their cheeks pierced! 
In any case, it is an inadequate
 description of the sweet in it! 
I shall have to ask you 
to accompany me to the station. 
- It's a fair cop. 
- And don't talk to the audience! 
Albatross! 
Albatross! 
Albatross! 
You're not supposed
 to be smoking that!
Albatross! Don't take them! 
What flavor is it?
 What flavor is it? 
Seagullsickle! 
Pelican-bonbon! 
Albatross! 
Could I have... 
Could I have 
two ice-creams, please? 
I haven't got any ice-creams,
 I just got this albatross! 
Albatross! 
Uh, what flavor is it? 
Well, it is an albatross, isn't it? 
There's no bloody flavor! 
Albatross! 
There's gotta be some flavor, 
I mean everything's got a flavor 
All right, all right! 
It's bloody albatross flavor! 
Bleedin' seabird, 
bleedin' flavor! Albatross! 
Do you get wafers with it? 
Of course you don't have
 fucking wafers with it, you cunt! 
It's a fucking albatross,
 I mean... 
Stop that! Stop that!
 It's filthy!
Come along! 
Right now, we need you! 
The one in the black, we need you
 for another skit on stage. 
And you, get off! 
You're not even a proper woman! 
Don't you oppress me, mate! 
What are you trying to do?
 Avoid registration or something? 
Bleedin' sexist! 
Come on, we need you
 for a skit! 
No one enjoys a good 
laugh more than I do. 
Except perhaps for my wife
 and some of her friends. 
Oh, yes, and Captain Johnson. 
Come to think of it,
 most people enjoy 
a good laugh more than I do,
 but that's beside the point. 
Right! Let's get on
 with this skit! 
Where's the other 
person for this skit? 
Right, you want to sit in that chair?
 And...cue...the...skit!
Evening, squire! 
Good evening. 
Is your...is your wife a goer? Eh? 
Know what I mean? Know what I mean? 
Nudge, nudge! Know what I mean? 
Say no more! 
I-I...I beg your pardon? 
Your...your wife. 
Does she go,eh?
 Does she go, eh? Eh? 
Huh, sometimes she has to go, yes. 
I bet she does! I bet she does! 
Say no more! Say no more! 
Know what I mean? Nudge, nudge! 
I'm afraid I don't quite follow you
Oh, "follow me, follow me"? 
That's good, that's very good! 
A nod's as good 
as a wink to a blind bat! 
Are...are you selling something? 
"Selling, selling"...very good indeed!
 You're wicked, you are, eh? 
Wicked, eh? Ho-ho-ho! 
Whoa! Wicked! 
Say no more! 
Whoa! So your wife's 
interested in...in sport? Eh? 
Ah, she likes sport, yes. 
I bet she does! I bet she does! 
As a matter of fact, 
she's very fond of cricket. 
She likes "games", eh? 
Likes "games"? 
Knew she would, 
she's been around a bit, eh? 
- She's been around?
- Well, she has travelled, yes. 
She's from Glendale. 
Say no more!
Glendale, squire? 
Say no more! Say no more! 
Say no more! Say no more! 
Well... 
Is your...is your 
Glendale wife interested in...
photography? Eh? Eh? Eh? 
Photography? 
"Photographs, eh?" 
he asked him knowingly! 
Photography? 
Snap, snap, grin, grin, wing, wing,
 nudge, nudge, say no more! 
Sort of...holiday snaps, eh? 
They could be, they could be 
taken on holiday, you know! 
Swimming costumes, candid...
you know, "candid" photography? 
No, we don't have a camera! 
Ah. Still, whoahaah! Eh? Whoahaah! 
Eh? Whoahaah! 
Eh? Whoahaahaha! Huhuh! 
Look, are you 
insinuating something? 
Oh, no, no, no
...yes! 
Well? 
Why, I mean, you're a man
 of the world, squire, you know...
you're...you've been around, you know? 
What do you mean? 
Well, I mean, like, you've...
you know, you...like...
you've done it, you know...
you've slept...
with a lady? 
Yes. 
What's it like? 
Good afternoon, 
and welcome to a 
packed Olympic stadium 
in Munchen for the second leg
 of this exciting final. 
And here comes the Germans now,
 led by their skipper "Lobby" Hegel. 
They must truly be favorites
 this afternoon. 
They've certainly attracted 
the most attention from the press 
with their team problems. 
And let's now see 
their line-up : 
The Germans playing 4-2-4, 
Leibniz in goal, 
back four Kant, Hegel, 
Schopenhauer and Schelling, 
front runners Schlegel, Wittgenstein,
 Nietzsche and Heidegger, 
and the midfield duo 
of Beckenbauer and Jaspers. 
Beckenbauer obviously 
a bit of a surprise there. 
And here come the Greeks, 
led off by their veteran 
centerhalf Herakleitos. 
Let's look at their team : 
As it's expected 
it's a much more defensive line-up. 
Plato's in goal, 
Socrates is a front runner there, 
and Aristotle as sweeper. 
Aristotle, very much the man in form. 
One surprise is 
the inclusion of Archimedes. 
Well, here comes the referee: 
Con-Fu-Cu, Confucius 
and his two linesmen, 
St. Augustian and St. Thomas Acquinus. 
And as the two skippers 
come together to shake hands 
we're ready for the start
of this very exciting final.. 
The referee, Mr. Confucius,
 checks his hand... 
...and...they're off! 
Nietzsche and Hegel there, 
old Jaspers, number seven, 
on the outside, 
Wittgenstein there with him, 
there's Beckenbauer, 
Schelling there, 
Heidegger covering, 
Schopenhauer,
 and now it's the Greeks. 
Epikuros, we find him number six, 
Aristotle, Empedokles 
and Deraklites, 
and Demokrites with him,
 there's Archimedes, Socrates, 
there he is, Socrates, 
Socrates there going through...
there's the ball, there's the ball. 
We'll be bringing you back 
to this exciting contest 
the moment anything 
interesting happens.
Very fussable, isn't it?
Very fussable. 
Right, all right. 
Good glass of Château de Chasselas,
ain't just that, sire? 
Oh, you're right there, Obadiah. 
Right. 
Who would have thought,
 thirty years ago, 
we'd all be sitting here 
drinking Chateau de Chaselet, eh? 
Aye, aye. 
Them days we were glad to have
 the price of a cup of tea. 
- Right! A cup of cold tea! 
- Right! 
Without milk or sugar! 
Or tea! 
In a cracked cup and all. 
Oh, we never used to have a cup! 
We used to have to drink out
 of a rolled-up newspaper! 
The best we could manage was 
to suck on a piece of damp cloth. 
But you know, we were happy 
in those days, although we were poor. 
- Because we were poor! 
- Right! 
My old dad used to say to me: 
"Money doesn't bring you 
happiness, son!" 
- He was right! 
- Right! 
I was happier then and I had nothing! 
We used to live in this 
tiny old tumbled-down house 
with great big holes in the roof. 
House! 
You were lucky to live in a house!
 We used to live in one room, 
all twentysix of us, no furniture,
 half the floor was missing, 
we were all huddled together 
in one corner for fear of falling. 
You were lucky to have a room!
 We used to have to live in the corridor! 
Oh, we used to dream of 
living in a corridor! 
Would have been a palace to us! 
We used to live in 
an old watertank on a rubbish tip. 
We'd all woke up every morning 
by having a load of rotten fish 
dumped all over us! 
House, huh! 
Well, when I say a house, 
it was just a hole in the ground, 
covered by a sheet of tarpaulin,
 but it was a house to us! 
We were evicted from our hole in the ground. 
We had to go and live in a lake! 
You were lucky to have a lake! 
There were 150 of us living in a shoebox
 in the middle of the road! 
- A cardboard box? 
- Aye! 
You were lucky! 
We lived for three months in a
rolled-up newspaper in a septic tank! 
We used to have to go up every morning,
 at six o'clock and clean the newspaper,
go to work down the mill,
 fourteen hours a day, 
week in, week out, for six pence a week,
 and when we got home, 
our dad would slash us to sleep
 with his belt! 
Luxury! 
We used to have
to get up out of the lake 
at three o'clock in the morning,
clean the lake, eat a handful of hot grubble,
work twenty hours a day at mill,
for two pence a month, come home, 
and dad would beat us 
around the head and neck 
with a broken bottle,
 if we were lucky! 
Well, of course, we had it tough! 
We used to have to get up out of 
the shoebox in the middle of the night, 
and lick the road clean
 with our tongues! 
We had to eat half a handful
of freezing cold grubble, 
work twenty-four hours a day at mill
for four pence every six years, 
and when we got home, our dad 
would slice us in two with a breadknife! 
Right!
I had to get up in the morning
 at ten o'clock at night, 
half an hour before I went to bed,
 eat a lump of cold poison,
work twenty-nine 
hours a day down mill 
and pay millowner 
for permission to come to work, 
and when we got home, 
our dad would kill us 
and dance about on our graves, 
singing Hallelujah! 
Are you trying to tell 
the young people of today that, 
and they won't believe you! 
No, no they won't! 
Well, there may be no score, 
but there's certainly no lack 
of excitement here, as you can see, 
Nietzsche has just been booked
 for arguing with the referee. 
He accused Confucius 
of having no free will, 
and Confucius he say 
name going book, 
and this is Nietszche's 
third booking in four games. 
And, oh, that is Karl Marx. 
Karl Marx is warming up, 
it looks as if it is going to be 
a substitution on the German side. 
Obviously manager Martin Luther
 has decided on all-out attack 
and indeed he must, with only 
two minutes of the match to go. 
But the big question is: 
Who is going to be replaced? 
Who is gonna come off? 
It could be Jaspers, 
Hegel or Schopenhauer. 
But it's Wittgenstein! 
And here's Marx! Let's see if he can
put some light in this German attack. 
Evidently not. What a shame. 
Well, now, with just over a minute left, 
replay on Tuesday looks
 absolutely vital. 
There's Archimedes, 
and I think he's had an idea! 
Eureka! 
Archimedes out to Socrates,
Socrates back to Archimedes, 
Archimedes out to Herakleitos,
 he beat Hegel, 
Herakleitos is a little flick, 
here comes on the bardboard Socrates, 
Socrates is there! It is in! 
The Greeks are going mad! 
The Greeks are going there, 
Socrates scores, beautiful counter
the Germans are disputing it! 
Hegel is arguing about ethics, 
Kant by the categoric
 imperative is holding that 
ultimologically possessed 
only in the imagination 
and Marx is claiming it was off-side! 
But Confucius blows the final whistle
it's all over! 
Germany, having chanced 
England's famous midfield trio 
Vincent, Mogalov in the semifinal,
 have been beaten by the odd goal! 
And let's see it again! 
There it is, 
Socrates, 
Socrates heads it in,
 and Leibniz somehow has no chance! 
And just look 
at those delighted Greeks! 
There they are, chopper Sokrates,
 Empedokles, and Deraklites! 
What a game here! 
And Epikuros is there,
 and Sokrates, 
the captain who scored
 what must probably be 
the most important goal
 of his career! 
Ooh! Good afternoon, sir.
 May I help you? 
Yes, I'd like to have 
an argument, please. 
Certainly, sir. 
Uhm, have you been here before? 
Ah, no, this is
 my first time. 
I see. 
Well, do you want to have 
just one argument or were you thinking
 of taking a course? 
Well, uh, 
what is the cost? 
Yes, it's one pound for
 a five-minute argument, 
but only eight pounds 
for a course of ten. 
Well, I think I'll just try the one
 and see how it goes from there. 
Fine. Ah, yes, 
try Mr. Barnard, Room 12. 
Thank you very much. 
What do you want?
- Well, I just was...
- Don't give me that, 
you snorty-faced pair of parrot droppings!
 Shut your festering gob, you tit! 
Your type make me puke, you vacuous 
stuffing old malodrious pervert! 
Listen, I came here for an argument! 
Oh, oh, I'm sorry,
 but this is Abuse! 
- Oh, oh, I see! 
- Hahaha! 
- Terribly sorry.
- No, you want Room 12A, next door. 
- Oh, I see. Thank you very much. 
- Not at all. 
Stupid git... 
Uh, is this the right room 
for an argument? 
I told you once. 
- Uh, no, you haven't. 
- Yes, I have. 
- When? 
- Just now. 
- No, you didn't. 
- Yes, I did. 
- I'm telling you I did! 
- You most certainly did not! 
Wait a moment, is this the five-minute argument
 or the full half hour? 
Oh, oh, I see. 
Just the five-minute. 
Just the five minutes... 
Right, thank you.
 - Anyway, I did. 
- Oh, no, you didn't. 
Now let's get one thing
 absolutely clear. 
- I most definitely told you. 
- No, you didn't. 
- Yes, I did. 
- No, you didn't. 
Oh, look, this isn't an argument! 
- Yes, it is! 
- No, it isn't! It's just contradiction! 
- No, it isn't! 
- It is! 
- It is not! 
- It is! You just contradicted me! 
- I did not! 
- You did! 
- No, no, no! 
- You did just that!
- Nonsense! 
- Oh, this is futile! 
No, it isn't. 
Yes, it is. 
I came here for a good argument. 
No, you didn't. 
You came here for an argument. 
Yes, but an argument 
isn't just contradiction! 
- Well, can be. 
- No, an argument is a connected series 
of statements intended
 to establish a proposition. 
- No, it isn't! 
- Yes, it is! It isn't just contradiction! 
Look, if I argue with you, 
I must take a contrary position. 
Yes, but that isn't 
just saying "No, it isn't!" 
- Yes, it is! 
- No, it isn't! 
-  Yes, it is! 
- Argument is an intellectual process. 
Contradiction is just a automatic 
gain-say of anything the other person says! 
-It is not! 
- It is! 
- Not at all!
-  Now look... 
Thank you! Good morning! 
What? 
That's it! Good morning! 
I was just getting interested! 
Uh, I'm sorry, 
the five minutes is up! 
That was never five minutes, 
just now! 
- I'm afraid it was. 
- Oh, no, it wasn't. 
I'm sorry, I'm...
I'm not allowed to argue anymore. 
What? 
If you want me to go on arguing,
you'll have to pay for another five minute.
But that was never
 five minutes, just now! 
Oh, come on! 
Oh, this is ridiculous! 
If you want me to go on arguing,
you'll have to pay for another five minutes! 
Oh, all right. 
Here you are. 
Thank you. 
- Well? 
- Well what? 
That was never five minutes, just now!
I told you, 
if you want me to go on arguing, 
you'll have to pay 
for another five minutes. 
Yes, yes, well, I've just paid! 
- No, you didn't!
- I did! 
- You did not! 
- I did! 
- You never... 
- I did! 
Oh, what are we even 
arguing about! 
Well, I'm very sorry, 
but you didn't pay! 
Aha! But if I didn't pay,
 why are you arguing? 
Ahaaa! Got you! 
- No, you haven't. 
-Yes, I have. 
If, you're arguing,
I must have paid. 
Not necessarily. 
I could be arguing in my spare time. 
- Oh, I've had enough of this! 
 - No, you haven't! 
- Yes, I have!
 - No, you haven't! 
I've got two legs 
from my hips to the ground 
And when I lift them
 they walk around 
And when I lift them 
they climb the stairs 
And when I shave them 
they ain't got hairs 
How sweet to be an idiot 
As harmless as a cow 
Too small to hide the sun 
Almost poking fun 
At the warm but insecure untidy crowd 
How sweet to be an idiot 
And dip my brain in joy 
Children laughing at my back 
With no fear of attack 
As much retaliation as a toy 
How sweet to be an idiot 
How sweet 
I tiptoe down the street 
Smile at everyone I meet 
But suddenly a scream 
Smashes through my dream 
Fi fa fo fum 
I smell blood of an asylum 
Hey you 
You're such a pedant 
You've got as much brain as a dead ant 
As much imagination as a caravan site 
But I still love you 
Still love you 
How sweet to be an idiot 
How sweet 
How sweet 
How sweet
- Good morning. 
- Oh, good morning. 
Uhm, have you come to arrange a holiday
 or would you like a blow job? 
I'm sorry? 
Uh, oh, you've come 
to arrange a holiday? 
- Uuh...yes. 
- Oh, sorry, sorry. 
Now, where were you thinking of going? 
Uh, to India. 
- Ah, one of our adventure holidays. 
- Yes, that's right. 
Well, you'd better see 
Mr. Bounder about that. 
Uh, Mr. Bounder, this gentleman 
is interested in the "India Overland"
and nothing else. 
Ah. Hello, 
I'm Bounder of Adventure. 
Oh, hello. 
My name is Smoketoomuch. 
What? 
My name is Smoketoomuch.
 Mr. Smoketoomuch. 
Well, you'd better 
cut down a little then. 
- I'm sorry? 
- You'd better cut down a little then. 
Oh, I see! Smoke too much 
so I'd better cut down a little then! 
Yes. Ooh, it's going 
to get people making jokes 
about your name all the time, eh? 
No, actually, it never struck me before.
 Smoketoomuch... 
Anyway, you're interested 
in one of our holidays, are you? 
Yes, that's right. 
I saw your advert in the blassified ads. 
- The what? 
- In The Times Blassified Ads. 
Ah, The Times Classified Ads. 
Yes, that's right. 
I'm afraid I have a speech impediment.
I can't pronounce the letter B. 
- Uh, C. 
- Yes, that's right, B. 
It's all due to a trauma I suffered
 when I was a schoolboy. 
- I was attacked by a Siamese bat. 
- Uh, ah, a Siamese cat. 
No, a Siamese bat. 
They're more dangerous. 
Listen...can you say the letter K? 
Oh, yes. Khaki, kettle, Kipling,
 Khomeini, Kellog's Born Flakes. 
Well, why don't you say the letter K
instead of the letter C? 
Well, you mean, 
pronounce "blassified" with a K? 
Yes, absolutely! 
- Classified! 
- Good! 
Oh, it's very good! I never 
thought of that before.
 What a silly bunt. 
Now then, uhm, about the holiday... 
Yes, well, I've been unpackaged store 
many times before, 
so your advert 
really bought my eye. 
Good, good, jolly good, 
well, let me offer you this... 
Why-why, what's the point
 of going abroad, 
if your just going to be treated like a sheep? 
Cartered around in buses 
surrounded by sweaty mindless oaves 
- from Vetchy and Boventry. 
- Absolutely. 
They've blothed backs and their bardigans
 and their chances to radios, 
complaining about the tea or they don't 
make it properly, do they? 
And stopping at endless Majorcan
 bodegas selling fish and chips 
and Rodney's Red Barrel 
and calamares and toothache. 
And sitting in their cotton sunfrost,
 squirting Timothy White Suncream 
all over their puffy, raw,
 swollen, parollen flesh, 
'cos they overdid it on the first day. 
Yes, I know just what you mean! 
Now, what we offer is... 
Being herded into countless 
Hotel Miramars and Bellevues,
Bontinentals with their international luxury 
modern roomettes... 
- Oh, yes. 
...and swimming pools full of draft Red Barrel
and fat German businessmen pretending
 to be acrobats and forming pyramids
and frightening the children and... 
- Oh, yes. 
...barging into the cues. 
And if you're not at your table... 
- Oh, yes. 
...spot on seven you miss your bowl 
of Campbell's Cream and Mushroom Soup, 
the first item in the menu 
of International Cuisine. 
- Absolutely. Now what we have here is... 
- Every Thursday night 
there's a bloody cabaret in the bar
 featuring some tiny dego 
with nine-inch hips and some 
fat bloated tart with her hair 
really creamed down and big arse
 presenting flamenco to foreigners. 
- Will you be quiet, please?
- from Birmingham with bloody right
- Will you be quiet? 
- legs and diarrhea trying to pick up hairy, 
bandy legs ,whop degos called Manuel.
- Be-be quiet! 
And once a week there's 
an excursion to local Roman remains, 
where you can buy 
Cherry Aid and melted ice cream 
- Be quiet! 
- and bleedin' Rodney's Red Barrel. 
- Shut up! 
And one night they take you 
to a typical restaurant with local...
- Shut up! 
...atmosphere and color 
and you sit next to a... 
- Shut up! 
...party from Relu who keep singing 
"I love the Costa Brava!" 
- Shut up! 
"I love the Costa Brava!" 
And you get cornered by some 
drunken green grocer from Luton 
with an Instamatic camera 
and last Tuesday's daily express... 
- Please be quiet! 
...and he's on and on and on about
 how it is running the country 
and how many languages 
Margaret Powell can speak 
and she throws up all over the cuba libre.
 And spending four days on the tarmac  
at Luton Airport on a five-day 
package store with nothing to eat 
but dry sandwhiches.
- Shut up! Please shut up! 
And you can't even get a glass
 of Rodney's Red Barrel because 
you're still in England with the 
bloody bar closes every time you're thirsty.
And the kids are crying and vomiting
 and breaking the plastic ashtrays. 
They keep telling you won't be 
another hour, but you know damn well 
your plane is still in Iceland, 
because it had to turn back, 
trying to take a party of Swedes to... 
oh, Shut up! 
...to take a party of Swedes to Yugoslavia.
 Of course it loads you up there 
at 3 a.m. in the morning. 
And then you sit on the tarmac for four hours 
because of unforeseen difficulties, 
i.e. the permanent strike 
of airtraffic control over Paris. 
When you finally get to Malaga airport, 
everybody's cueing for the bloody toilet,
and cueing for the bloody half-customs officers, 
and cueing for the bloody bus 
that isn't there, waiting to take you to the hotel
that hasn't yet been built. 
When you finally get to the half-built ruin 
called the Hotel Limassol, 
while paying half the holiday money 
to a license Spaniard in a taxi, 
there's no water in the pool, 
there's no water in the bath,
there's no water in the tap, 
there's only a bleeding lizard in the bidet
and half the rooms are doublebooked, 
and you can't sleep anyhow, 
'cause the permanent are in the jungles 
in the hotel next door. 
Meanwhile, the Spanish National Tourist Board 
promises that the raging cholera epidemic
is merely a mild outbreak of the Spanish Conleigh, 
while the like of the previous outbreak
in 1616 even the bloody rats are dying from it! 
As early as the late 14th century,
or indeed as late as the early 14th century, 
the earliest forms of japes were divisible in... 
Meanwhile, the bloody guardia are arresting
16-yearolds for kissing in the streets
everybody's buying awful little horrid
 donkeys with their names on, 
I can't tell you the...-
and when you finally get to Manchester, 
there's only another bloody bus 
to carry you another 60 miles... 
As early as the late 14th century 
or indeed as late as the early 14th century, 
the earliest forms of jape 
were divisible into the two categories 
in which I now intend to divide them. 
The earliest manifestation 
of the basic simple precipitation jest incurred, 
as will be seen from the demonstration,
a disproportional amount of internal
resibility on the part of the operator. 
The secondary precipitation occurs when 
both protagonists and dupe are located indoors.
It is true, however, that this 
has involved the development 
of a special piece of machinery. 
But it is still no more 
than a simple variation
 of primary precipitation. 
The opening-up of the African continent
 revealed a vast new source of wealth 
for humourous exploatation. 
We are to see demonstrated how this 
was adapted to the basic
 precipitation jape. 
We now come on to a considera... 
We now come on to a consideration 
of the more sophisticated transitive mode 
of japing, in which as we'll observe,
 the operator or inceptor remains totally unaware 
of the humorous implications of his action. 
First...first we are to see 
the simple sideswipe or "wop." 
Hey, Vance! 
Next, the "sideswipe and return." 
Hey, Vance!
And now, 
the "double sideswipe and return." 
Hey, Vance! 
Popular as this jest has always been,
 however, it cannot compare 
with the ribbled connotations associated
 with the dispatch of an edible missile. 
First...first the simple 
straightforward "offensive deposit." 
Second...second the simple 
"sideways offensive deposit." 
Next, the simple "surprise deposit." 
And now, the "foul pie." 
Uh, could we have new pies, please? 
Finally, finally we move on
 to the interesting 
but little known variant, normally 
designated the "three-course complex." 
But...but finally we must not forget 
the enjoyment, the satisfaction, 
and the edification to be derived 
from the simple straightforward 
"sideways completely unexpected deposit." 
Once upon a time there was
 a little house in a dark forest. 
In this house lived a humble 
woodcutter and his wife
and their pretty daughter, 
Little Red Riding Hood.
And in the middle of this deep, 
dark forest, there lived a vicious wolf! 
One day, Little Red Riding Hood sent off 
to take some things to her old grandmother 
who lived deep in the forest. 
The vicious wolf 
saw Little Red Riding Hood 
and thought: 
"She looks very good to eat!" 
"Where are you going my, pretty one?" 
"Oh, kind sir, to my grandmother's." 
"Ha, ha, ha, ha!" 
snirked the wicked wolf 
and dashed off through the forest 
to grandmother's house. 
"Knock, knock, knock" 
went the wicked wolf. 
The door opened wide, 
but it wasn't grandmother who opened it. 
It was Buzz Aldrin, 
America's #2 spaceman! 
But this was not Granny's little house at all,
but the headquarter of NASA, 
the American space research agency. 
The wicked wolf was shot
 by security guards. 
So all was quiet in the forest again. 
The humble woodcutter and his wife 
sold their story 
to Der Speigel for 40 000 DM. 
NASA agreed to limit the number of 
nuclear tests in Granny's little house 
to two on Thursdays 
and one on Saturdays after tea. 
Liberal rubbish! 
What do you want 
with your jugged fish, Klaus? 
Pardon, my wide-thighed plum? 
What do you want with your 
jugged fish, you clothied git? 
- Hallibut! 
- The jugged fish is hallibut! 
All right. What fish do you have 
that is not jugged? 
- Uuh, rabbit.
- What, rabbit fish? 
- Well, it's all covered in fur.
 - Well, is it dead? 
Well, it was coughing up blood
 last night. 
All right, I'll have the dead,
 unjugged rabbit fish. 
Apalling! 
Oh, you're always complaining. 
- What's for afterwards? 
- Well, there's rat pie, rat pudding, 
rat sorbet or, uh, strawberry tart.
- Strawberry tart? 
- Well, uh, it's got some rat in it. 
- How much? 
Six. Rather a lot really. 
I'll have a slice 
without so much rat in it. 
Apalling! 
"Moan, moan, moan!" 
- Hello, mom! Hello, dad!
- Hello, son! 
There's a dead bishop
 on the landing! 
- Where...where's he from? 
- What do you mean? 
What's his diocese? 
Well, he looked a bit
 Canterburyish to me. 
I'll go and have a look. 
- I know which's bringing them in here.
- Well, it's not me. 
I put three out by the trashcans last week
 and the garbagemen won't touch them. 
- It's the bishop of Leicester!
- How do you know? 
Tatooed on the back of his neck!
 I think I'd better call the police! 
Should you call the church? 
- Call the church police!
- That's a good idea! The church police! 
Hello!
 What's all this then? Amen! 
- Are you the church police? 
- Oh, yes! 
There's another dead bishop
 on the landing, sergeant! 
Detective Paerson, madam! 
What is he? R.C. or C.V.? 
- How should I know?
- Tatooed on the back of their neck!
Here, is that rat tart? 
Oh, uh, yes.
Disgusting! Right, men! 
The hunt is on! Let us kneel in prayer!
Oh, Lord! 
Oh, Lord, we deseach thee. 
Let us know, who killed the Bishop of Leicester. 
The one in the braces, he done it. 
It's a fair cop, 
but society is to blame. 
Right, we'll arrest them instead! 
Come on, you! Are you in society? 
Are you in society? 
Ho, ho, ho, ho... 
Right, we'd like to conclude 
this arrest with a hymn. 
The whole thing's bright and beautiful,
 all creatures great and small. 
The whole thing's bright and wonderful... 
I never wanted to be
 in such a shambledy sketch. 
I always wanted to be...a lumberjack! 
Leaping from tree to tree...
as they float down the mighty rivers
 of British Columbia! 
The larch...the redwood...
the mighty sequioa...
with my best girl by my side! 
The giant deadwood, the spruce
...the little Californian root tree! 
We'd sing, sing, sing! 
I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK, 
I sleep all night and I work all day. 
He's a lumberjack and he's OK, 
he sleeps all night and he works all day. 
I cut down trees, I eat my lunch,
 I go to the lavatory. 
On Wednesdays I go shopping, 
and have buttered scones for tea.

I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK, 
I sleep all night and I work all day. 
I cut down trees, I skip and jump, 
I like to press wild flowers. 
I put on women's clothing,
 and hang around in bars. 
He cuts down trees, he skips and jumps,
 he likes to press wild flowers. 
He puts on women's clothing, 
and hangs around in bars? 
I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK, 
I sleep all night and I work all day . 
I cut down trees, I wear high heels,
 suspenders and a bra. 
I wish I'd been a girlie, 
just like my dear papa. 
He cuts down trees, he wears high heels, 
suspenders and a bra? 
What kind of god damn 
fairy cunny fairy faggot... 
I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK,
 I sleep all night and I work all day. 
I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK!
