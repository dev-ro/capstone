Recep Ivedik.
Tell me, why do you avoid
the alcohol test?
Plus, you got out of the car
and harrassed the officers.
Sir, l'm a young man.
That night when l saw...
...something white approaching
at waist level...
...and someone commanded
''Blow it.''...
Allright. Cut it out, you loofe.
Take your things and get lost.
Don't you ever show your
face again. Move it.
Yes, sir.
- Hi. Are you the safe
custody guy? - Yes.
The police chief sent me.
l'll take these and leave.
Mobile phone. Belt.
Window crank.
- What's this?
- These are marbles.
They have emotional value
for me.
- Uncle, please buy one.
- Whoa! Why do you scare...
- Why do you frighten me?
- Please, buy one.
Got no money.
Get lost.
- Please, buy one.
- Boy...
Hey! Dude!
Hey!
Hold it there.
Give it to me.
- l found it.
- How's that?
What are you gonna do with it?
You don't pay any rent and tax.
What are you going to do?
Piss off!
Fuck off!
Dear viewers,
l wish you all a nice day...
...from the beaches
of Antalya.
The beaches are full with
beautiful Russians.
Salih! Put two beers
in the basket.
l'll take them
on the way back up.
l'll take them here.
Get inside, you drunkard.
Listen to me, woman.
Don't talk shit.
You know what happened last time
when l pulled the rope.
Don't piss me off.
lt's just two beers.
What are neighbors for?
- Scum!
- You fart!
Redneck! Orangutan!
Antalya is swarming with Russians.
Well well well.
lf they are human...
...then l swear l'm an animal.
We're with Mr Muhsin, the owner
of Antalya Joy Nashira Hotels.
Being the highest tax payer
this year, what's your secret?
Being record holder is
like an award.
l owe this success to being fair,
honest and righteous.
There are very important
moral values for me.
Being fair, loyal and most
important, being honest.
When you're honest, all doors
open up in front of you.
Well put! Bravo!
l swear, you and l
are birds of same feather.
l'll bring you this myself.
l'll do anything for you.
Bravo! Salih, fix me
some food for the road.
Hi. l thought you have some
car problems and l stopped.
- Am l right?
- Yes. We were driving.
Suddenly the engine stopped.
We don't know anything
about engines.
Could you take a look at it?
l have to ask some questions
to find the problem.
Where did it break down exactly?
How fast does it accelerate
from 0 to 100 km/s?
Are the rims aluminum
or steel?
Seats fabric,
or fabric and leather?
Does the car have
ABS, ESR EBS?
l should know to apply
an appropriate therapy.
Can you tell me all the
standard features?
What has that
got to do with anything?
Shaddup!
Shaddup!
lf you're that knowledgeable,
why didn't you fix it...
...instead of fluttering here
like a dove?
Beat it! Buzz off!
Start the engine.
Get in and start the engine.
Step back! Step back!
l don't trust you at all.
You're sneaky.
You're sneaky.
Start the engine.
l am!
Come on, start.
Could the battery be dead?
Get back in and don't
piss me off, you brat.
lt's the battery.
Don't panic. l have a battery.
l'll give you that one.
Start the engine now.
Don't keep the car in gear!
Why are you driving me nuts?
Back off!
Never keep the car in gear!
You don't ever know the value!
Allright, anyone can make mistakes.
l'm Ok.
lt worked.
Oh, my sweety.
That electric look in your eyes
will get your head crushed.
Buzz off.
Of you go.
Have a nice trip, sweeties.
Farewell.
Clear!
God, damn it.
Tozkoparan Road Service.
How can l be of help.
- Hello, road service.
-
Yes, sir.
l gave my battery to
two ladies to help them out.
They left. And what luck,
now my car won't run.
lf you have given your battery
the car won't run.
What do you mean
it won't run without battery?
Does this car not run on gas?
ls this an electric car?
- What a shitty car is this?
-
Sir, please listen.
Listen. Are you recording this
for customer satisfaction?
Then damn all the technical staff
who listen to this.
l'll knock your head in.
Chill out. What's up?
Hi. My car broke down.
Where are you guys heading for?
- We're off to lsparta.
- And l'm off to Antalya, dude.
- Let's off together.
- Hello, guys.
Yo twin jerks.
l'll rip your tongue out.
Laugh at your own asses.
Why do you laugh like a horse?
Why do you laugh?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
Don't you have parents?
What's this filth?
lt stinks like a stable,
it stinks like between the legs.
Did you eat sheep, nibble
on goats? What's this filth?
l'm traveling to Antalya
with four bacons.
This is absurd, outrageous!
Your asses are all
covered with moss!
Open a window!
lt stinks like between the legs here!
Why on earth did l join you?
Why... Can l ask
why you're staring at me?
Why do you stare?
What's up?
Why do you stare?
Why do you stare?
Folks... l also like that guy...
...who walks on Taksim Square.
Drinks two beers and...
...walks around like me.
Teoman.
His lifestyle is just like mine.
l saw someone servicing your
mom... in the market.
You wouldn't sink
in the sea, you know.
- Why, am l the Titanic?
- No, you look like a cork.
Do you dig my sense of humor?
For example, that light there...
l watch Discovery Channel.
There's that pervert.
Looks around like that.
The skinny one, with bulging eyes
white ass...
Everyone looks the other way
and he goes like that...
Got it?
Was like a movie.
l didn't understand the animals.
First l dug into myself.
l tried to understand myself
but in vain.
That dude is a mile high.
Guys, l'm starting to feel hunger
and my gustral juices flow up.
- Do you have the same?
- Nope.
Got any chocolate?
Look around a little,
maybe you have some.
Yes or no?
Yes or no?
Let's stop somewhere
so that l can get some chocolate.
They are hilarious.
l've never seen such a bunch
ofjerks.
- Hello, brothers.
- Welcome.
You got any chocolate?
No. We got beans.
Wanna eat?
l could eat even you,
Super Mario.
Get some beans.
What is that?
Not so fast, mate.
Are you a member of the
Karaambar Truckers community?
Karaambar?
l'm not. So what?
- Then you can't eat those beans.
- Why is that?
Only our members can take
benefit of our facilities.
l'm not taking benefit of anything.
l just want beans.
Serving beans is the most important
privilege for our members.
Jeez, l've never seen
a place like this.
l want to be a member too.
Prepare the backside. l'm going
to make a new member entry.
Watch out or a new member
may enter you.
Behold, two valiant stepped up
on the ground...
Both are equally renowned.
Come on, wrestlers.
Wheels roll with
prayers and tears...
...surely shall win,
one of these two bears.
Recep leads by one.
Now that we have a draw.
lt's time for the final crawl.
Mahmut.
Recep, now take your chance.
Blow over the bottle
with your flatulence.
Here you are, brother Recep.
Your member card.
From now on you can always
get beans at Karaambar.
God bless you, chief.
Next week we're opening a gym
in the backyard.
Don't forget my movie house.
We'll do that too. Next year.
Bravo.
l've got a long way to go.
ls anybody headed for Antalya?
l'm going that way.
Let me give you a lift.
lt will be a pleasure.
Good bye.
Life fucks!
- Brakes are for wimps!
- Move on brother Recep.
l only complete with the airlines.
Long live, brother Recep.
Roads end, sorrow prevails.
lf l say l'll be back
l willl.
Thank you, bro.
Otherwise l'd end up stranded here.
There are all kinds of bastards
crooks, rapists...
...killers, perverts.
l'm glad you joined me.
The road is long.
lt's hard being alone.
l'm glad too if it's fine for you.
- Are you single?
- Yes. And you?
l'm single too.
We share the same faith, huh?
You know, no woman is
tough like us.
You got a point.
They're all fake and lies.
They don't like me. l never met
a woman that got along with me.
lf l were a woman, l'd let you
take me at first sight.
l'd let you take me too.
lf l were a women
you'd be the first to take me.
Usually you'd find women
pictures here...
...but you have all black males.
Are you into body building?
No, l'm into body builders.
They're so wet, hot...
...all sweaty.
Screw you, don't piss me off.
Pull over here.
- Pull over!
- You got me wrong there.
l'll stick that gear lever
up your ass.
l just wanted to have a decent
conversation and you're after my ass.
- You misunderstood me.
- Fatsy! Sexmaniac!
- l'll get out here.
- Allright, bro. Fine.
You're acting stupid.
Fuck off. Shame on you.
Fuck off and
don't drive me nuts!
ls Ankara this way?
You're completely wrong,
it's this way. Turn around.
Come this way.
l'll come with you.
Just go...
Stop right there.
Turn around here.
Drive 700-800 km straight on
and you'll get to Ankara.
- Damn you!
- Stop cursing early in the morning.
Oh my.
Look here, Rapunzel.
ls Muhsin here?
You mean Mr Muhsin?
What's this about?
lt's private. l have something
that belongs to him.
l see. Do you have
an appointment?
l don't like appointments.
l prefer living spontaneous.
A procrastinated, complaining life.
What's that got to do
with anything?
Go find me Muhsin.
Don't trouble me.
- Where do you come from?
- From home.
l fought wolves, wrestled
with truckers.
l'll handle it, Aysegül.
Yes, sir. What's this about?
God almighty.
You take turns in asking
what's what.
You make such a fuss! l found
Mr. Muhsin's wallet...
...and brought it here
from lstanbul.
Give it to me and
l'll hand it over to him.
- Yeah, right!
- What's going on?
Bullshit! Does this look
like the eye of a dupe?
- What do you mean?
- You're going to pocket it, right?
You're going to grab it, huh?
You hyena.
Swipe it all, huh?
You snake.
You're completely wrong, sir.
You managers are all
flattering dogs.
You're all brown-nosers
when the boss is around.
When they leave,
you're the king.
What are you saying?
Go get me Muhsin. Move it.
l'll give it to him in person.
Allright. Calm down.
Can l get an lD?
Please, wait here.
l'll be over there.
Sir, what happened here?
Two kids came along. One from
here, the other from over there.
They started to fight,
came all the way here.
One of them hit the other
in the head.
l caught him in the air and
kicked him that way.
Then l slapped the other one.
He rolled over to the hall.
The vase began to sway.
l couldn't catch it.
Whatever. Mr. Muhsin is waiting
for you. l'll handle this. Follow me.
Get this cleaned.
- Get it all cleaned up.
- l'll handle it sir.
What a fine coffee.
- Enjoy.
- Muhsin, are you a kid?
You can't take care
of your wallet.
Those rocker guys
you call irresponsible...
...have their wallets all chained up,
but you lose it.
What an absurd, unruly,
silly life.
What a disoriented,
bohemian life style.
Come to your senses.
This is no way to live.
l can't agree more. lt's impossible
to find honest people like you.
- lsn't that so, Erim?
- Yes, sir. You're right.
l have to return your favor.
l'd like to repay.
- lf you would accept this.
- Are you giving charity?
- By no means.
- l was just being humane.
- There's still humane people around.
- But Mr. Recep...
Shaddup!
ln that case, let's accommodate you
one week in our hotel for free.
That's unheard of!
l despise such offers.
- You could at least..
- Shaddup... dawg!
Brown noser!
Loser!
Get smart.
Well, l'm off.
l'll have to walk 700-800 km.
Here's my card with my number.
You can call me whenever you want.
- Beware, l'll call whenever l want.
- Whenever you want.
- Whenever l need something.
- Whenever you want.
- You're just a phone call away.
- lt's fine.
Muhsin Basaran. My man.
- Good bye.
- Good bye.
- Yo. Got any smoke?
- No, l don't smoke.
Do hot babes come
to this hotel?
- Of course.
- From where?
Russia, Germany, Holland.
Very hot chicks.
Look, a tourjust came in.
Are you perverse?
lt's the first time
l see such a group.
What's that on your leg?
That's my birth mark.
My mom's gift.
l have it since l was very little.
Looks like shit stain.
Sibel, move it.
Hello. Dear Muhsin.
Listen mate.
l've decided to rethink
your hotel offer.
- Your name.
- l'm answering. Recep Ivedik.
Welcome. Mr. Muhsin has placed
you into one of our best suits.
Thanks.
Our hotel is all inclusive.
So let me put that on.
What you mean ''put on''?
l'll put it on myself.
Why are you coming along? l think
l can find my room on my own.
That's for sure but l have to
show you around your room.
- Why?
- Manager's orders.
All rooms are numbered.
Do l look like an idiot?
- Won't l find my room?
- lt's just procedures.
Here's our room.
- Hold it there. Step over.
- Why?
l don't let any other filthy male
enter my privacy.
- l was just going to show the room...
- Show what?
ls that an 80 m2 room? lt's just
a 20 m2 room, a sofa bed...
...a TV and coffee table.
What's to show?
You just want to go lndra Gandhi
on me, you snake.
l won't fall for that.
Allright, sir. Here you are.
Come over here.
Attention!
Where can l get in touch with
the group that came in today?
- At dinner.
- When?
- 8 o'clock.
- Dismissed!
Beat it!
Get out of my way.
l'm exhausted.
These bags are heavy
like corpses.
The bellboy was going to carry
them but you didn't let him.
Just to avoid a tip...
Money is the most valuable thing.
You don't squander it away.
Phone. Phone.
Just answer it!
To hell with you.
You thickhead.
Hello. Ahmet.
Sibel?
She's in the shower, dear.
She's tired from the trip.
Don't worry. l'll make you both
go along again.
Of course, my child. May God
never separate lovers.
Good evening, my child.
Good evening, my child.
Open your ears.
He's the best you can find.
- His family is noble.
- You mean rich.
Of course. And he's
very generous.
You had a little fight and he sent
us to a five star hotel.
You should be grateful
that you're lucky like this.
Fuck such luck.
You brute. You're not
ashamed at all, are you?
l don't want to hear
such things again.
You build a five-star resort but
the bottles are like my dick.
What good will that do?
lt's my door,
so all is fine.
- Pervert.
- Shaddup!
You're the pervert.
Fatso. Get lost!
All our guests are elite like you.
There are only families here,
it's very suited for children.
There's no electrical phase
in the room. Where's that bellboy?
Where's the bellboy?
Fadil, deal with it. Let me
take you to your room.
What's this?
What's going on?
lt's the new trend.
ldiot, l got locked out.
You can't walk around like this.
l'll take care of it.
Come along.
You were supposed to show me
the room but didn't do a shit.
lf it's that simple, why did you
make me go downstairs...
...covered in foam, and
disgrace myself?
You didn't let me into your room.
l would've told you.
When you put your card in here
you get power.
l'll never set foot in that
damn tub again.
l'll wipe off my armpits and my
testisterones every other week.
That's it.
- What time is it?
- 1 1 pm.
- So l missed dinner, huh?
- Yes.
l like the light in your eyes.
Let's have a beer with you.
l'd like to but the manager
would get mad.
Don't get me started
with your manager.
Don't get me started
with your manager.
l'm aggressive,
l have complexes.
l'll beat the shit out
of your manager.
Sit down. All sort of shit
happened to me cause of you.
- Why is that?
- What do you mean ''why''?
l got out because of the card thing,
thinking the room had no power.
Just when l was taking care of it
l got locked out.
A fat, repulsive woman came along
and called me pervert.
There's one in your neighborhood
just like her. l hate her too.
l'm aggressive
and have complexes.
When l lower my shields
l'm as tame as a cat.
- You mean...?
- You have to be kind to me.
lt's a very important day for
our hotel. We have to be very alert.
What's with that shirt? Button up.
You should set an example.
Where have you been?
l was with Mr. Recep.
That's great. From now on
you're responsible of him.
You'll follow his every step.
lf he causes problems...
- ...l'll hold you responsible.
- Yes, sir.
This is very important.
lt's very important for the
tranquility of our hotel.
- Yes, sir.
- Great. Button up.
Yes, people...
Florance projection.
ls this out of order too?
What are you doing, you oaf?
You closed the toilet. Do l have to
piss in my pants in a 5-star hotel?
lt's not closed. We wrapped it
and wrote ''for your protection.''
Do you write everything you do?
How dare you enter
my private room?
How can you violate
my privacy, lady?
You put up a ''clean room'' sign.
Give me that.
- What does is say here?
- Clean my room.
- Does that mean ''clean my room''?
- Yes.
- What does it say here?
- Do not disturb.
Than l'm all ''do not disturb'' to you.
Get lost.
You're all blown up.
Tie a cord around your ankle...
...and you could be sold
as a balloon to kids.
Buffalo!
Rhino-shaped, tempered,
curly Vampirella.
Distorted piranha.
Clean yourself
before cleaning up the room.
What do you think you're doing?
Are you insane?
- l was just...
- This is a 5-star hotel...
- ...in case you didn't notice.
- The hotel...
Shut up! What are you
babbling about?
Get over here.
- l'm sorry.
- Boy, what are you doing?
Are you insane?
Take a load of him.
Looks like he was born
5 minutes before monkeys.
What are you doing at the pool?
Just go to the trough.
And wet yourself over there.
Move it.
Brother Recep, what happened?
- There was this bee and... - You don't
walk around the pool like that.
l wasn't. There was this
bee around my head.
Come along.
- How do l look?
- Great.
- Take a good look.
- Cool. This is it.
- Will you keep it on?
- Yes.
- Let me take off the alarm.
- Why?
Cause the alarms beep.
Were the alarms on these
when l bought them or not?
- Yes, sir...
- On them or not?
These belong to me then and
nobody can say anything.
- But sir...
- The alarms are mine.
Allright, damn.
Then keep them.
Look here. You ugly duckling.
Calimero.
What do you mean ''damn''?
l'll knock your head in.
lt's alright, bro.
Everything's fine. Chill.
Let's get out.
l'm getting irritated here. Out.
Put these on Mr. Muhsin's tab.
He's VlP.
- Plus, l'm VlP.
- What's going on?
l'll leave a mark of my slippers
on your leg like that.
- Come bro.
- What a crackpot.
lt's over, alright.
Do you hear it?
You see?
That's what l'm trying to say.
l love the sound of the alarm.
Keep laughing like this.
- Let me take that too.
- What are you going to do with that?
l thought if something's missing
she might get fired.
Let's go.
7-5.
Bravo! Hello,
l want to play too.
- You again?
- Yes, me.
l'm a guest here too. lt's my right
to play beach volley.
Not in our team.
Go play somewhere else.
l'll play in the opposing team then.
Dude, get out.
- Get lost!
- l'm playing here.
Shaddup. Get lost.
Watch out for your positions.
Let's take good positions
and beat them good.
Hit it.
Mr. Recep's team has won.
Here.
Why the long face
because you lost?
What long face?
We may be opponents on the field
but outside we're friends.
- We're no friends.
- l wanted to give you something.
What?
- This. - What am l supposed
to do with that?
- l won this for you.
- Don't want it.
- Will you please take it?
- l won't.
Please.
We won!
What's up here?
ls this a cookhouse?
- lt's the open buffet line.
- What's open buffet?
You get in line and get as much
of any food you like.
Can l eat here as much as l like
from any food?
Of course.
- Are you sure?
- l am.
- l push the limits.
- Do so.
l don't know any limits.
That's my motto.
- So it is.
- Do we have a deal?
Deal.
Sister, don't grab food
as if it were yours.
How many dolma are still there?
Are you starved or depraved?
Why do you eat dolma?
Beat it!
What are you doing, Mr. Recep?
This is outrageous.
What's this? Please,
go to the other side.
What are you doing?
ls this a way to eat?
- You said open buffet.
- Yes, but...
You said l can eat
as much as l want.
- Yes, but...
- Why do you weasel out?
Not at all. What weasel...
- Shut up!
- Mr. Recep.
Shut up!
Dear guests, please
get food from the other side.
Please. To the other side.
Guys, take all these.
What are you doing?
This is no way to eat.
What are you doing?
Get lost!
l don't understand why they
let in such animals.
What's not to understand?
They got the big money.
We had an uncle Recep in the hood,
looked like an animal.
He sat cross-legged
in the Mercedes.
Hello, bon appetit.
May l sit down? Thanks a lot.
l apologized for my stupidity
earlier on with a cup...
...but l also got a döner plate
prepared for you. Enjoy.
Thanks, l don't eat meat.
lt's delicious. Made of veal rump
and neck fat.
l'm about to pass out.
Why do you insist?
She said she wouldn't eat.
Why do you keep stalking us
all day? l've had enough of you.
l'll complain about you.
Caveman.
l do sports and aerobics
every morning...
...eat healthy. l suggest
you do the same.
l'll leave this anyway. Maybe
the lady will eat it.
Her stomach has several layers
and her second chin...
...looks like a pelican beak. lt's obvious
that she's a heavy eater.
- Bon appetite.
- Monster.
l want to add
''Nice to meet you.''
Do l have any
sagging parts?
Yahya, you have to use 2 bottles.
You can't fool the tourists like this.
Yes. Smile while you're at it.
Smile.
- Hello, mate.
- Welcome, Mr. Recep.
l've decided to adopt a healthy
lifestyle.
l want to attend aerobics.
When does it start?
You and aerobics?
lt's at 8 am.
Since l have sleep acnea,
l can't wake up that early.
- Could it be a little later?
- No way.
But l can wake you up at 8.
Do you have any aerobic wear?
l bought them recently, they
don't stink or anything.
You need a special outfit
for aerobics.
- l can get it for you.
- Swear?
- Sure. Don't worry.
- Really?
- l'll get them.
- Would you swear?
- Why should l?
- Promise me.
- Promise.
- Will you really send me an outfit?
- l will.
- And if you don't...
- Goodness gracious.
- And if you don't...
And if you don't...
- lf you don't you're a fag.
- But why?
- lf you don't, you're a fag.
- Allright.
- Are you going to send them?
- Yes.
Take a scout's oath
and l'll believe you.
How do you do that?
Something like that.
Yes. Are you satisfied now?
- God bless you.
- Don't mention it.
3. 4.
Yes, ladies.
Now lay down on your side.
Up and down.
Hello, teacher.
Yes, sir. Please sit.
Good morning, ladies. Let's
burn our calories...
...and get rid of our
fatsy tummies. Thanks.
With this move we work our
abs and intestinal muscles.
Up and down.
Unbelievable! How monstrous
and stupid are you?
We're working on bowel movements
together with out instructor.
l ate too much döner and now
have gastro-induction.
And it found it's way out.
What's to do?
l can't care less. You just
ruined my exercise.
Take a look at those tights.
Gross!
Helly, Mrs. Sibel. Today
at 3 pm. Don't forget.
- l won't.
- He wears tights too.
Why don't you condemn him?
Please, these are no tights.
This is scuba diving wear.
Bullshit. Scuba diving wear, huh?
lt slides in, too. Doesn't it.
Scuba wear was invented by
French sailor Marcell Ducell in 1 781 .
Shaddup!
Marcell Ducell, my ass.
Did l ask?
This is common culture. And you're
wearing a lady's outfit.
You bought it wrong.
l didn't buy these.
That lousy manager
gave them to me.
What?
What are you laughing at?
What? ls it funny?
This is aerobic wear.
ls it any funny?
l don't speak no Turkish.
l speak German.
Get lost.
Psycho duo.
This cove is called
''the aquarium.''
lt's been told that Cleopatra
washed her hair here...
...and Zeus sanctified Artemis
in these waters.
The cove is 55 m deep and has
over 300 fish species.
Did you count them?
Excuse me?
300 species you said and
l'm asking if you counted them.
- Of course.
- Name them!
l will. No big deal.
Bluefish, gray mullet, sea bream,
whiting, muraena, eel.
Small bluefish.
- Turbot.
- Bravo. Turbot.
Did l say bluefish?
What happened to 300?
Where are the other 291? Jerk!
When you asked suddenly,
l couldn't remember.
l'll name them all after
the dive.
Are we ready for the dive?
Let's go over the rules again.
This means ''up''.
This means ''down''.
OK.
This is ''OK'' to the boat.
When we do this during
football matches, it means...
...''Referee, may my head
enter you.''
What are we doing now?
Don't you ever
leave the group.
lf you get stuck in a rock,
l'm sorry but you make this.
This makes me laugh
all the time.
Like this?
You're joking again.
Anyway, let's get to know
the equipment.
This is the tank.
These are the fins.
Mask.
l guess this is the snorkel.
Why should there be a snorkel
during a dive, idiot?
You don't know
anything about diving.
Where's the regulator?
Where's the BCD?
Where's the government?
What kind of a diving instructor
are you?
Jeez, an instructor
like you l should...
Here's another move to
complete it.
But l'll do that underwater.
Jerk.
Another interesting joke.
Anyway, if we're ready
let's put on the tanks...
...and let's dive.
Please.
Diving is very popular in our family.
My grandpa dived in the
Bering Straits in 1942.
Skindived to 50 meters.
Just with a snorkel.
He caught a bluefish
with his hands.
He was that kind of a guy.
l'm not talking in vain.
Put something on your head,
you'll get cold.
lf it gets cold, let it go.
The piss will warm you up.
Sis, help me with that.
Sibel, ask your mom
if it's OK?
No. l can't do this.
l'll stay on the boat.
l can't breathe.
We press on this button
and dive. Come on.
Who came up with this diving?
l'll die of worry.
One, two, three, four.
One is missing.
Where's the hairy guy?
Where's the guy?
Where the hell is he?
lt's been 3 hours.
He doesn't have that much air.
He's not going to come.
Why are we waiting?
Do so many people
have to wait for one?
Yes, Captain.
Let's go.
l have blood pressure problems
and need to take my pills.
l don't care where that
filth turns up.
He'll find a sewer to surface.
Allright, you go back then.
l'll stay.
ln all these years l have never
left someone back at sea and l won't.
Son...
...from now on you're in charge.
l'm staying.
Cut!
lt's no good.
Moan, not scream.
And you'll do like this.
- We're losing the light.
- What light?
Yo.
- What are you doing there?
- We're shooting a movie?
- What kind of a movie?
- Jack off movie.
- What's with you?
- l was looking for Manavgat.
Turn your back towards me,
stick your head into the sea.
There's Manavgat.
Be careful and don't let the
voices overlap.
That's the golden rule of movies.
We have no overlapping voices
but overlapping actors.
The gendarmerie patrols this
area a lot. Watch out!
Good evening!
You don't run around like this
so late, my boy.
l almost had a stroke.
l apologize because of my outfit.
But l have struggled for 1 7 hours
all alone...
...in the raging blue waters
with rays, sharks...
...and caretta carettas
to make it here!
Why didn't you wait up for me?
We waited for hours. When you
didn't surface, we had to return.
Plus, when my mom got ill
we had to.
Sorry to hear.
What's your disease?
Thanks, l have
blood pressure problems...
...and have to take my pills.
The sun made me worse.
And l get sea sick easily.
l'm still swaying.
Do you have headaches
among the symptoms?
Yes, a little. Why?
Very bad.
l had a grandma and she was
chubby, whale-like like you.
She said she had headaches
and went to sleep.
And she kicked the bucket
around 3 am.
Her body was swollen up
like a pig and all purple.
We tried to take her out
with my grandpa...
...but she didn't fit through the door.
They opened the window...
...and we pulled our pickup truck
beneath it.
We put her body through the
window and on the truck.
That's how she got to the morgue.
Heaven forbid,
you ill-omen.
He's like bad news.
That's life, lady. The pleasure is
nice, but the pain is hard.
Sibel, l fought at 47 meters
with a herd of sea horses.
Wrestled with two seals
and whacked one of them...
...and got you this
sea shell.
Put it on your ear
and you hear folk songs.
Listen.
Thank you. You didn't have to.
l don't listen much to folk songs.
l'm more into R&B and pop.
Electronic discotronic style.
Something like that.
Have a good evening then.
Eat less. You eat too much.
You may drop dead any moment.
You're gorgeous fiancee waits
for you in Netherlands...
...but you accept sea shells
from rednecks here.
And then it is
''Mom, don't get involded.''
l'll beat the living
daylights out of you.
Don't rub that on your face.
He took it out of his crotch.
You'll get infected.
What's up, bro?
Smell this. ls it alright?
- What is this?
- Room spray. Want some?
- No, thanks.
- Open your arms.
Lift your other leg.
Yes, that's more like it.
That's how you should smell.
- Let's go.
- Where?
- To the disco.
- l have to pass.
lt's very important for me
and l need you by my side.
Thanks but l'm having
problems with the manager.
- l shouldn't come.
- To hell with the manager. Move.
Excuse me for tonight.
What kind of a man are you!?
What kind of a mind do you have?
What kind of a brain you got?
And most important
what's with your heart, you beast?
l'm telling you it's the most
important day of my life.
You have to stand by my side.
Curse the day l met you!
Curse the day l let you
into my privacy!
Beast! Dog!
Let me take that, so l never
be in need of a lowlife like you.
Come on.
Shameless!
Hi Recep! Do you
hang around such places?
Of course. l'm a disco child
of the 90's.
Who's that retard over there?
- He's one of our friends...
- l'll find it out myself.
l really need it.
l'll make sure you relax tomorrow,
don't worry.
Hi. What's up? Who's this guy?
Do l know him?
- Hi, l'm Murat.
- l'll beat you flat.
What's up you tart?
l'll make you fart.
That's no way to talk...
l got plenty of these lines
Recep always ''beep'' your kinds.
Are you a child
to tease like that?
l can tease you in very
different ways, dude.
Get on the dance floor
if you have balls.
Listen pall, l'll make you sorry
and burry you in the floor.
Cut that ''burry you'' crap
or else l'll knock your head in.
Step on the floor if you dare.
- Come on.
- Move!
- Come on!
- Move!
- Bravo, you were great.
- Thanks, mate.
Be careful, it'll knock you out.
l'll be fine.
He's completely flipped out.
Boy... Wake up!
You look like
a stranded whale.
- ls it morning already?
- Yes. What are you doing here?
Don't you have a place
to sleep in?
- Oh, mum. Was that you?
- What makes me your mum?
You're drunk
and stink like pest. Alcoholic.
Listen, l respect you because
you're a mother.
- Where's Sibel?
- What's it to you?
Stay away from my daughter.
Or l'll place a complaint and get you
kicked out of the hotel.
- Mum, l'm going in.
- Allright, my child.
lf it's good,
l'll have it too.
Fine.
What kind of a talk is that?
You're a mother.
''lf it's good, l'll have it too''
and such.
What a dirty talk is that?
l'm very good.
You'll be very happy.
How can l help you, sir?
l was just going to look
for my friend, sis.
Yeah, right. ls this a disco
where you can look for a friend?
This is a massage parlor.
You can't get in
without appointment.
ls this like the massage parlor
we visit with Salih...
...where the massage ends
with a happy end.
There hasn't been a single women
who wasn't pleased by me.
The secret is in my fingers.
Magic fingers.
Which room shall we put
Mrs. Sibel?
- Number 3.
- OK, l'll get prepared.
l have to take a shit.
lt's starting to get out.
Where can l shit?
Where's the men's room?
Over there. Go.
There's your happy end,
jackass.
Plus with these hands.
Magic fingers.
Hello.
Another friend was going to come
but l did. l'm sorry.
l'll do your massage.
Number 3 is full.
l'm so sorry.
Can l get you room 5?
lt's alright.
- l'm sorry.
- Never mind.
First massage, ankle, heel, calf.
Let's get your foot up.
Nice.
Now... there's someone in this
hotel who's in love with you.
Never mind his name.
His name starts with me.
All men look out to take shelter
in a haven at some point.
But at the same time desires
a stormy sea.
That's why...
...you're just the kind of woman
a man could wish for.
l would like to recite you
a poem l wrote.
l'd like to see the light
in your eyes
And the joy you bear inside
You're like a festival
l want to attend you
You're like a rock festival
Where l want to set up a tent
Recep says
l want you
How's that?
Did you walk a lot yesterday?
Why are your feet swollen?
Did you get stung by a bee?
Your feet have turned
into hooves.
Huh? Your legs are like
Roberto Carlos'.
Your feet have turned into
cow hooves.
There's something
strange about you.
You should have a birth mark here.
Let me have a look at it.
Just a second.
lt's here. Nobody said such
beautiful words to me.
What's going on?
Who the hell are you?
Don't make any stupid moves.
l'll smash your head in.
Darling, where are you going?
Wait. Don't run away.
Sibel, where on earth were you?
Sir, stop, stop!
Let me take a picture.
l don't want any photos.
Please.
Just one photo
as a token.
l don't want any photos.
Leave me alone.
lt will be perfect,
trust me.
l told you l don't want
any pictures taken.
Don't be shy. l'm the
hotel paparazzi.
Just one nice picture.
Yes.
- Do you get the pool too?
- Yes. Beautiful.
Let me pose for you.
Very nice.
- Count from three.
- Fine. 3, 2, 1 .
- But sir, this is no good.
- Get lost.
Why to all nutcases
swarm around me?
You too?
- How many megapixel is that?
- Five.
Five?
- Let's get some pictures taken.
- Fine.
Why did you look that way?
Your boob touched my arm
and l panicked.
l don't get well along
with women.
Yeah, right. A woman was chasing
after you at the spa.
What an pain in the neck.
''Kiss me Recep, eat me.''
Plus, she's hideous. Ugly people
have a right to be loved, fine.
What am l supposed to tell her...
...''Rip out your heart, throw it
into the toilet and flush it.''?
Let's get back to us. l want that
picture, will you send it to me?
- Sure. You got an e-mail address.
- Yes. Memorize.
recep-*!?-ivedik95''@.com
Nonsense, there's no
mail address like that.
Why not? l got them
when they first got out.
l pressed on to many keys,
that's why.
But l always use this one.
- My messenger lD is different.
- Skip that.
- Will you come to the show tonight?
- l haven't decided yet.
l'll take a look into my organizer
and come if l'm available.
- Will you go?
- l think so.
Let's meet there.
Don't stay too much in the sun.
Heaven forbid, you might
get a sunstroke.
Then headache, fever and then
diarrhea. You know, the squirts.
Be careful.
There's so few photos, shoot more.
Family photos, kid photos.
How are you, boy?
What is that uncle doing?
Really, what is he doing?
Look away!
What's this photo doing here?
Why did you shoot his photo?
Go and play in the park.
Yo. Yo.
Look here.
What are you doing
cringed all up here?
Come here, kitty.
Sweet kitty.
Brother Recep.
Where to?
l'll eat you.
- To the animation show.
- Let me take you there.
Do l look like an idiot to you?
You think l won't find
a damn amphitheatre?
- Take this here.
- What's that?
Clean it up from lice and fleas,
and feed it.
- Allright?
- Yes, sir.
Good for you.
One more time.
Very nice.
Dear guests, we have
2 contestants on stage.
Before choosing the final one,
l'd like to remind you of the rules.
The men have the balloons
on their laps...
...and the girls sit on them. The
fastest pair to break the balloon...
...will win the game. Now
l'll chose the final contestant.
A volunteer male. You, sir.
No? Are there
no man here?
Welcome, sir.
- Please, sit.
- No.
l've got nothing to do with this.
l came through the wrong door.
This is a game.
Please, sit.
- l've got nothing to do with this.
- Very nice.
Don't applaud!
Don't!
- l've got nothing to do with this.
- Your name?
- Recep.
- Let's hear it for Mr. Recep.
l want a volunteer lady
for Mr. Recep.
Thanks. God bless you.
- Me! Me!
- Please.
No! Not that woman!
l don't accept this.
l won't accept this.
Please, just a second.
You asked for a lady
and look at this.
- Please, sit.
- No. l'm not OK with this.
- We're going to win.
- Win what?
- l'll devour you.
- That's what scares me!
- Then l'll eat you slowly.
- No, thanks.
Don't applaud!
l count down from three
and we start.
Don't count!
3. 2. 1 .
My testisterones!
Stop! lt hurts!
Get off me!
l'll punch your head in!
Why do you laugh?
Don't!
Brother Recep!
What are you doing?
What kind of a woman are you?
l've had enough of you!
Rhino!
- Come along.
- Stop talking! Don't laugh!
Mr. Recep, what are you doing?
ls this a trough?
Get out of there.
Sorry, l got thirsty.
l apologize.
Enough is enough. They say
you cursed at the audience...
- ...last night, during the show.
- l didn't curse at all.
Everybody was laughing.
The lady was disgraced.
What are you doing?
l lost count of the
problems you caused.
Giving the finger
in the photo.
This hotel is not used to
such things.
This is a five-star complex.
Hear me well. l'm aggressive,
l have complexes.
l don't give a damn if you're
the manager and choke you.
l'll tear down your hotel.
Are you threatening me? Great.
Please, leave the hotel.
- Who are you?
- l'm the manager of this hotel.
Who are you?
l'm a member of Karaambar
Truckers Community.
Karaambar Truckers Community,
huh? What's that?
Who are you? Bandits?
Do we live in the mountains?
How could you tear down the hotel?
Who are you?
Karaambar Truckers whatsoever.
Who are they?
You really spoke very harsh.
You took a grenade,
pulled out the pin...
...and you're holding it
in your hand.
You couldn't scare me
with your whole family!
Get out! Out!
Just say it and we'll
bring down the hotel.
Start digging, mates!
Stop!
Whoa! Hold your horses!
But Mr. Recep, please.
What do you suggest
l tell them?
Stop or move on?
Please, don't.
l didn't mean it like that.
l just wanted to meet your
friends.
That's why l said ''Who are
those friends?''
That's what l meant.
Welcome.
And they came to meet you.
lntroduce yourself.
- l'm Halil. Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise, sir.
l'm Erim. The hotel manager.
Look, what a kind-hearted
person he is. Welcome.
Don't mention it.
l'd like to talk to you in private
when you're available...
...babe.
Pleased to meet you, sir.
Really.
l'm sure you don't have any
questions about me anymore.
What questions?
You are our guest, sir.
You don't have to be so formal.
Drop the 'sir.'
He's very funny, huh?
Mr. Recep is a real joker.
Answer the phone.
Don't look at me,
answer the phone.
Yes?
Yes, Ahmet?
Thanks, how are you?
Ahmet, l want to tell you
something.
l can't marry you, Ahmet.
l'm really sorry.
l really tried.
l tried to love you.
Give me that.
Hello? Ahmet, my dear,
how are you?
Excuse her, she's young.
She's excited because
she's getting married.
Don't worry. l'll talk to her
and handle everything.
Have a nice day,
my child.
What do you think you're doing?
l can't marry someone
l don't love.
Are you going to
disgrace me?
You're engaged.
You should've thought twice before
forcing me to be with him.
Shame on you!
l did it all for you.
l wanted you to have
an easy life.
Enough! l'm sick and tired
of thinking about these.
lt was really stupid
to accept this at all.
l want to marry
someone l can love.
Why won't you understand?
Love won't still your hunger.
Get to your senses.
You'll marry him
as soon as we're back.
Talk as much as you want.
l'm not marrying him.
You will and that's that.
Oh God.
Enough! l've had it of such
stupid subjects.
l'm going for a swim.
l was walking by and saw you
upset. What happened?
Nothing. Never mind.
You look upset.
l saw it. What happened?
- Some people get on my nerves.
- Who's that?
Anyone who gets on her nerve
will get a beating!
l'll knock their face in.
What was that?
Sorry, there was too much
gas in my stomach.
Look at me.
l see, there's something
naughty underneath the beauty.
Can you do this?
Gross. Look.
ls that your mom?
Yes.
Hey!
Mum!
Help! There's a hairy
monster on me!
- Mom.
- l'm dying.
l can't breathe.
My guts.
Are you alright, auntie?
My ribs.
ldiot!
What makes you ride here?
ls this a path?
Everyone's basking here
and you ride between them.
Ox!
Get lost!
- Brother Recep. You're great.
- Thanks.
Mum?
l almost passed away today.
Don't talk nonsense.
l was going to die before
l saw you in a wedding dress.
Sibel, you're going to marry
Ahmet, won't you?
Allright, mum.
- l'm not promising anything.
- What's that supposed to mean?
Sibel, don't leave me here.
Brother Recep,
here are your marbles.
Thanks a lot. Yo, nutty boy.
Pour in a little vodka in here.
- Are you sure it's alright?
- Nothing's gonna happen.
More, more, more. There,
it's starting to kick in.
l ask the guy ''Why do you
get me fainted...
...and have the water
affect me like concrete?''
He says ''l thought you had fun.''
l have panic attack.
l can't put up with everything.
He said ''You're right, bro.''
l said ''lf l catch you on land
l'll whoop your ass.''
l'll turn you into one
of those rings.
He got scared.
Am l right, tourist?
You bounced
on the water like balls.
ls that a nice word to use?
ls that nice?
What do you mean 'balls'?
Why do you drive me nuts?
lsn't that so?
l'll throw you one
right in your face...
...and make you smile
all your life.
What's this, is he
stupid or an idiot?
You say something and
he makes funny moves.
The lV suits you very nicely.
Who's that?
lsn't that Sibel?
Yes, that's her.
- Hold this.
- What am l supposed to do with it?
- But no...
- Just keep on.
Hello there.
Hi.
What's wrong?
Nothing, Recep.
Forget it.
Did something happen
to your mum?
Did she reject therapy? ls she
in intensive care? What?
Mum is fine...
but l'm not.
- What's wrong?
- Forget it.
- Shall l tell you a story?
- Yes.
There is this clown who makes
all the crying people laugh.
Someday a crybaby
goes to the doctor.
The doctor says
''Go find that clown.''
And the guy says
''That's me.''
What's that
got to do with anything?
l didn't get that either. l don't
like those crappy clowns.
There was this movie: ''lt.''
All kind of strange things.
Recep, l'm engaged.
- Engaged?
- Yes.
So you're going to get wed?
- You know how families...
- lt's alright, Sibel.
- lt's my mom's...
- Hush, Sibel.
Sibel, don't talk, please.
But...
- But Recep...
- Shaddup!
What happened Brother Recep?
- They're tormenting me.
- Who?
People.
They talk crap,
get on my nerves.
Then they annoy me.
Nothing's working out for me.
Did l put a spell on someone
and it affects me now?
Everything's will be alright.
lt won't. My whole life is such
a knot...
...that it won't be alright.
lf we sit more like this, our
testisterones will catch cold.
Then we won't have any kids.
l'm leaving now, pal.
Got to hit the road.
Take care of yourself.
Don't let that ass of a manager
oppress you. OK?
- OK, bro.
- Recep lvedik got your back.
Allright, bro. l wish
you didn't leave that soon.
lt will be very
dull without you.
l'm aware of that
but have to go.
This place bears no meaning
for me any longer.
- l have a last request from you.
- Sure.
Give these to Sibel.
Make sure she gets them.
Don't worry.
These are yours.
- ls everything here?
- lt's all in there.
Food, shirt, slippers.
OK.
Let me give you a hug.
- ls that the manager's car?
- Yes, bro.
- Open the hood.
- Don't, in the last minute...
Open it. Don't get me
started with last minutes.
How could he leave
with my battery?
How could he leave
with my battery?
- But sir, l wasn't...
- Shut up! Don't answer back!
How can you be this careless,
indifferent and shameless?
Didn't l tell you to follow him?
You have no more leaves.
All leaves gone.
To hell with your battery!
You should've been more careful.
You're fired!
Bugger off! l quit!
- Did Mrs. Sibel leave?
- Just a few moments ago.
They're going to the airport.
Mrs. Sibel!
What happened?
Brother Recep asked me
to give you these.
Salih, are you facebook member?
No but if it's good
l can join.
Never mind. lt's full with
morons anyway.
l'm thinking of leaving.
Up, up. Little bit to the left.
- ls it good so?
- Great. Perfect.
To the auto industry park, please.
Of course, babe.
Good so. Lower.
Lower l said.
What are you doing here?
Sir, l swear we're shooting
an art movie.
- Art movie, my ass.
- This is a cult movie.
l have two weaknesses.
One is alcohol.
The other, women. Two.
l didn't get you. There's
no woman in your life.
- How could that be a weakness?
- Because there's none.
Since there is none
l'm weak towards women.
