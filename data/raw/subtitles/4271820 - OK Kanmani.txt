Ananya is getting married.
Last chance, hug her.
How did it go about?
-My family arranged it.
The guy is from US.
That's the end!
Welcome buddy, we are here.
-Thank you, buddy.
How much?
Hi, Bhavani! How are you?
Who are you?
-Prabhu.
I took you for Dilwale Dulhania
Le Jayenge last week.
I danced with you
for Kajol's song.
Who is he?
The gas supplier, right?
This is Adi, aunty.
Vasudevan from Chennai?
Uncle Ganapathy's friend?
His younger brother.
He'll be staying in your
guest room as your paying guest.
Are you his wife?
-No, who will marry Adi?
What did you say your name was?
-Adithya Varadarajan.
I'm Vasu's younger brother.
-Was the train late?
No, the car was late.
There are some conditions.
-Vasu told me.
What did he say?
That you're very strict
and I must pay rent on time.
The room must be clean,
no late nights...
...loud music,
smoking and partying.
But...
-My friend told me the rest.
Aunty is a famous
carnatic singer.
I shouldn't praise her
using Madras slang.
I'm not getting the right number.
-Try, Bhavani, you'll get through.
What else did he say?
He said that Aunty Bhavani
is the gem between the two of you.
Ananya said you're not friendly.
-You got me in trouble too.
He is hyper, uncle.
I don't know if I should
laugh or send you out.
Uncle!
-He's just kidding, uncle.
I'm giving you the
room because of Vasu.
He worked for me in the bank.
I'll give you one month.
If you're good, you get the room.
Or you have to leave.
Okay, sir.
We are trapped,
he has started his show.
Tamil sentiment.
Touch his feet, don't be shy.
Local game for local kids.
-Are you taking me for a ride?
The game starts
in a local train.
There is a killer.
And there is a victim.
We're caught between them...
---Player.
The victim falls...
...on the player's hand.
The victim has a bag.
There is a gun.
And a mobile phone.
Half torn Rs500 note.
Two Mumbai.
One Upper Mumbai.
Colour, glamour...
...fashion shows, discotheques,
Bollywood and...
...rich men.
Fast cars, big boats...
...pretty girls and bikinis.
Two, Lower Mumbai.
Hawala, contract killers,
black money, opium, drugs.
Game starts in Upper Mumbai.
We go below.
When we try to answer a call,
we get caught with a bad police.
If we pick the torn note,
the killer will get us.
We'll get caught
with the nastiest crook.
2 men, twins.
How will they come up again?
That's the game.
Mumbai 2.0!
I'll give you 6 weeks.
Within 6 weeks,
I want a working prototype.
I'm nervous.
Do you remember me?
I'm Adi.
Tara.
Number?
I'm do you know I'm Tamil?
You called me with a kind word
at the station the other day.
What did you say?
Senseless...
Senseless Kanmani (love).
-Kanmani?!
I heard an 'ich'.
Is there an 'ich' in Kanmani?
You'll say anything
when you're tensed.
Are you Ananya's friend?
-College mate.
We're working together now.
She is pretty and happy.
It'll be fun for some time.
They'll always be laughing.
Wedding and honeymoon.
-Kissing and hugging.
Love.
-Lust.
Lust has to be there.
Must see them later?
-What will happen?
Small arguments.
He'll joke about his
wife to his friends.
When they get back,
the wife would hit him.
A child in between.
-The child will wail.
And keep vomiting.
-Pooh all over.
They will look frantically
for a school to enrol the child.
Torture the poor child
who is not interested in studies.
After the child is bigger?
-Get her married...
...make her
face the same torture...
Make sure she goes
through it. Right?
100%.
You are so right.
Are you married?
I swear I won't get married.
-Wedding is for fools.
Right.
-Only girlfriends?
Around 15 of them.
-Very good.
You?
-I want to go to Paris.
Why?
-Further my studies.
You?
-I want to become rich.
Like Steve Jobs
or Mark Zuckerberg.
Late night party,
coming home at 3 am...
...I told you I don't like it.
-Sorry, uncle.
Ananya's wedding,
she got caught.
I want to go
to the Electricity Board.
My electricity bill
is not right the past 2 months.
If you pay them,
they'll correct it.
I don't believe in bribe.
I'll go and see them.
I'm not saying this
for you to praise me.
Bombay Jayashree
is performing this evening.
You're taking Bhavani.
-Me?!
You're going to take her.
Not too much sugar, right?
-I added the right amount.
- How can one man be at 2 places...
...at the same time?
You take her.
Ravindra Natya Mandir.
I have work in the office.
-Work finishes at 6.
Why are you following me?
-To keep an eye on you.
I've lived in Bombay for
23 years. I'll go on my own.
This is not Bombay
anymore, it's Mumbai.
That is why I'm following you.
-I said, don't follow me.
Okay, I won't.
When did they change
the name to Mumbai?
How are you?
Looks like you're a star.
-Yes.
Get out!
-Me?
You were snoring
during the performance.
I'm sleepy, aunty.
I work day and night.
Why are you so sleepy?
Get out!
Hello, Bhavani,
isn't this too much?
Are you going to leave or not?
Get down from the bus! Get out!
Go now!
-I'm not Uncle Ganapathy.
Don't yell.
-Go now!
Are you going to go or not?
-Okay!
No sense of appreciation!
How was the performance?
You're great,
Uncle Ganapathy.
You're like God.
Hats off!
Bhavani, do you want anything?
-I need to cook, it's late.
We cooked and ate.
Roasted potato, you made it.
When?
-It was nice and spicy.
You need to wash
the pot properly, it's burnt.
Alzheimer, early stage.
-Vasu told me before I came here.
She knows something is wrong.
That is why she gets
angry all of a sudden.
How do you look after her?
When she wakes up in the morning,
she calls me Ganapathy...
...and all will be fine.
What are you looking?
-No way, I can't be like you.
Let it soak,
I'll wash in the morning.
Yes, I've opened an account.
Which branch?
-Lokhandwala branch.
Your friend, Srikanth,
was there.
I want to save my money.
Tell me if you need more.
-No!
You don't need to send anymore.
-/ told you to meet K esa van.
Remember?
-Yes.
What happened?
-I'll meet him this week.
Do you know how to go?
-Vashi, right?
Right, the 3rd stop.
-3rd stop.
You gave me
all the instructions.
If you call and say
you're lost, I'll yell.
Yes, continue.
3rd stop in Vashi.
You won't get coffee there.
You only get tea.
-Right.
My battery is weak,
I can't hear you.
Hello!
Brother!
The number you're trying to
reach is currently not available.
It's me,
your 16th girlfriend.
I thought you were No. 10.
Can I talk?
Or is it wrong to call?
No, you can talk.
I felt like listening
to someone talk in Tamil.
Is that all you know?
No, I know Thevaram
and Thiruvasagam too.
Why are you talking that way?
Someone beside you?
Yes, ghosts and spirits.
Tamil ghosts?
-No, fat Hindi ghost.
Then you can speak.
Can we meet?
Isn't it wrong to make friends
with a Tamil guy so fast?
It is, but shall we make
a small mistake by having...
...coffee together at 3.45?
Besides, tomorrow is a Saturday.
Yes or yes?
-No.
Bye.
-Don't put the phone down.
I've put it down.
Bye to all the ghosts.
Guess who you are going
to work with?
Salman Khan?
-Architect Balakrishna Doshi.
Boss wants to see you,
come on.
Hi!
-Hi.
Where are you?
-Me? In my office.
Thank God I didn't wait
for you to have coffee.
What would have happened?
-I would have got angry.
Would have felt
like killing someone.
I'll talk to m ysell'.
I'll think whether to call you
or not.
Are you waiting there?
Sorry.
-I had 2 cups of coffee...
...and one lime juice.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.
Can you wait?
Promise?
-Promise!
Lift!
It's opening, I'm in the lift.
I pressed zero.
The lift is going down fast.
Still going.
I'll take an auto and come
there in 5 minutes...
Hello!
-Are you here?
Shall I wait for you there?
-Is this your idea of joke?
This isn't a joke,
coffee time.
Shall I push the bike
and walk with you?
What did you tell
in your office?
That I'm going to have millet
in a coffeehouse...
...with a Tamil guy.
-Tara!
Come on.
-Who is that hero?
He is looking at us.
-The man you saw at the station.
The bad guy?
You tried to stop
the train because of him?
Just a drama, I thought
he'll turn and look at me.
He didn't, you looked at me.
-He's coming.
What's the story?
-A friend.
Then all of a sudden
he wanted to marry me.
I said no.
He kept on following me.
Did you agree?
-No.
Then I found out
why he was following me.
Why?
He asked my friend,
Rathna, about me.
He asked about my parents,
our worth in Coimbatore...
...everything.
He didn't want to marry me.
He wanted my money.
What did you say?
-I agreed to marry him.
You agreed?
-I told him I'll leave my mother.
She won't give me a paise
and he must support me.
He got scared. I threatened
to jump in front of the train.
That's when you came.
With an insane heart...
Young and naughty...
With a beautiful tune...
Okay on my girl's lap...
With an insane heart...
Young and naughty...
With a beautiful tune...
Okay on my girl's lap...
Yesterday is gone...
Tomorrow is a pain...
Just like my Laila...
We're the king
and queen today...
With an insane heart...
Young and naughty...
With a beautiful tune...
Okay on my girl's lap...
Don't pinch with your eyes...
Don't go without disturbing...
Don't jump when I touch...
Don't go
even if I leave you...
Marriage, wife and in-laws...
Girl and boy...
Love...
With an insane heart...
Young and naughty...
With a beautiful tune...
Okay on my girl's lap...
Can we meet tomorrow?
-Yes!
Where?
-Ahmedabad.
Office work, express train.
-Then when?
Aunty Bhavani, how did you
and Uncle Ganapathy get married?
How did Uncle Ganapathy
and you get married?
He is cutting...
-Ladies finger.
Ask him.
-How did you win her?
Don't be shy, Ganapathy.
I'm from Kumbakonam.
There is no Tamil
or Cauvery in Bombay.
Bhavani had a performance
in Shanmuganantha Sabha.
Were you 20 then?
-19.SubTiTle By PMS Creation
She used to sing very well.
-How did I look? Tell them.
A big star. I used
to attend all her performances.
I had a friend called Sounderajan.
He came along with me.
A well known doctor but knew
nothing about classical music.
He came to woo Bhavani.
Did you close your eyes and
listen to my songs, Ganapathy?
Sounder told a letter to Bhavani.
-A love letter.
But he was too shy,
he told me to give it to her.
I gave it to her.
But the fool
forgot to sign the letter.
What would I think?
-That Uncle Ganapathy...
...gave you the love letter.
-Yes, he was dark and handsome.
One day, she held my hand,
took all the letters and...
...stood in front of her father.
We got married in 3 months.
We don't normally get
a second chance.
You must catch it when it comes.
-Smile, buddy.
What are you doing here?
Where is this train going?
Ahmedabad, right?
What for?
-Sightseeing.
Do you do this often?
-You mean go sightseeing?
Going after girls.
-Since birth.
Really? How many?
-I don't keep count.
You're lying.
I know you wouldn't even
have touched a girl before.
You may be right.
-How did you get the ticket?
I didn't buy a ticket,
didn't have the time.
What if you're caught?
-If I'm caught...
...I'm caught.
Okay, come in.
-Don't go, stand here.
They are waiting.
-What for?
They'll come and look for me.
-Let them look.
Okay, let them look.
What was the grandpa saying?
He is Balakrishna Doshi.
My guru.
-What did he say?
He told me not to trust
those who design video games.
My father comes here every day.
-Will he come now?
Does he like to fight?
Don't get me into trouble.
He won't come. He left.
-How?
He decided to leave,
so he left.
Mother?
-She is in Coimbatore.
What happened?
They were always fighting,
sometimes they used force.
Court case.
They called a 7 year old
and asked her...
...if she wanted to live
with mommy or daddy.
I didn't want both of them.
I decided then
not to get married.
We're late
for the train, right?
Run!
What shall we do now?
-How can you ask me?
The bus is only at 8 am.
There is a hotel nearby.
Both of us?
-Yes.
In one room?
-There is only one room left.
Will you behave
if we stay in one room?
I swear I won't behave,
I'll sleep in the balcony.
Will I behave
with you by my side?
Can you?
Can
-Why even bother?
A bad climax for a good movie.
Where is the hotel?
-Nearby.
Adithya Varadarajan?
-You don't even know my name.
What is that?
-Loopy.
Come here!
Come!
Say something.
Say what you're thinking.
Sing a song.
Song?
Sing.
Sing!
Shall / fly...
Shall / fly...
Shall / fly...

We'll vanish

Let's fly...
Let's fly...
Let's fly...
Let's fly...

Tell me it was the best
holiday you ever had.
This was my best holiday.
Did I say that properly?
You lied. Be truthful.
-Shall I be frank?
No, don't say anything.
Okay, Kanmani.
-Am I your Kanmani?
Yes, Kanmani.
Can I go now?
I have to go.
Say, "Okay, Kanmani."
-No, Kanmani!
Aunty!
Temple offering.
Hello, uncle.
-There are podi and pickles here.
Your aunty brought them.
Hi, mom.
-Let's go in and talk.
Where did you go?
-Ahmedabad, some research work.
Would you like to eat
in the canteen? Aloo poha.
Your friends came back yesterday.
-Are you here to spy on me?
Why? Is it wrong
to worry about my only girl?
You're not worried. You only
want to know where I went.
Okay, tell me, where did you go?
I was worried about you.
I even called
the commissioner.
I'm asking you, you're not
answering. Where did you go?
With whom did you go?
-Do you tell me each time you go?
Do I ask you with whom you go?
I'll slap you, I don't care
if we're at the hostel.
Tell me, where did you go?
Where did you go?
-To see father.
I went to see
his last place. Enough?
Don't behave like your father.
We have a big factory
and business back home.
Drop what you're doing here,
come and run the business.
Let's go.
-I'm going to Paris.
On a scholarship.
I don't think I'll be back.
I'm telling you,
why are you being adamant?
I told you I'm not interested
in that company.
How many times
must I tell you?
I shouldn't have let
you come this far.
I should have kept you
in Coimbatore.
Just leave me for some time.
So?
-What?
What happened in Ahmedabad?
-Nothing.
Nothing happened.
As far as I know,
you didn't take the train back.
You didn't come back.
-Right?
You didn't come.
-You spent the night there.
So what?
-Tell us who it is.
Who?
-I can't wait, tell me.
Girl.
-This is too much, tell us.
What are you doing here?
-Tell them you're not well...
...and come out.
Tell them you have a migraine.
You're dizzy...
...and you'll be back tomorrow.
-Are you crazy?
Come on!
I didn't sleep last night.
-Me too.
Really?
-My body is still shaking.
Adi, tell me you've had enough.
-Enough.
Then stop, don't come near.
-I'm trying, but I can't.
Don't!
Okay-
Love? Won't you say it?
-Shall I?
I want ice cream.
Shall I tell my mother
to come tomorrow?
What for?
To meet you.
-Me? Why?
Shouldn't they meet and talk?
We'll get engaged.
Engaged?
Look at your face,
you're scared.
I got scared.
So no engagement and wedding.
Right?
You said marriage is for fools.
-So the trip to Ahmedabad?
The kiss today?
Were you joking?
"No!
What?
-No means no.
We have to get away
from here now.
If I get caught, I'll lose my job.
-Why?
Come!
Phone!
Where are you taking me?
To your hostel.
-Why?
To send you back safely
to your room.
Why all of a sudden?
I want to send you back
before I change my mind.
What if you change your mind?
-I'll hug you.
If you hug me?
-I won't let you go.
Then?
I'll give you a kiss!
-Then?
I'll become Dushasana.
-Will you remove my clothes?
Yes!
Then?
You can go anywhere you want.
You can go to London or Paris.
But until then,
I'll beg you to stay with me.
If you beg?
You'll melt
and look at me lovingly.
And?
-You'll pull me inside.
And?
-You'll lock the door.
And?
-I don't know what to say.
You have to tell me.
-I'll eat you.
My little secret...
My little secret...
My small wonder...
Give me your tiny finger...
Give me a little space...
I don't know how to lie
for small desires...
Do you like me?
-A lot.
But this hostel is lousy.
Do you like me
or what we did?
I like what we did.
Then I like you a little.
A wee bit.
For Rs1.50.
Rs1.50 is enough.
It's trouble
if it is too much.
Listen to me.
Love and lust,
are they okay?
It's a sin, do you know that?
But you have to do the sin
repeatedly, then it'll go away.
I don't understand.
What did you say?
Tara wants to stay here
as a paying guest too.
'Taravu' is swan in Malayalam.
Where?
-Here, in my room.
In your room?
-Yes.
Is this Tara?
-Yes, Bhavani.
You?
-I'll stay in the room too.
Both of you?
-Both of you?
Together?
-Yes.
Are you married?
-No!
I don't believe in marriage.
-The groom has Sevvai dhosam?
If I marry him, I have to follow
him whenever he gets a transfer.
Why should we follow them, aunty?
-What is she saying?
I'll go abroad soon. Paris.
Adi will become rich.
He'll go to UK or US.
-Until then?
We want to live together.
Is it wrong, aunty?
-Definitely.
Ganapathy is old fashioned.
Old school.
When he's driving,
even when he gives signal...
...he'll bring down the mirror
and give hand signal.
Does your brother know?
-He'll kill me.
This won't work.
Uncle...
-It won't work.
Uncle Ganapathy.
-No!
Come out for a minute.
-The answer is no.
Just minute.
-It won't work in this house.
Come out for a minute.
Can you sing?
Must we meet secretly?
Or can we do it openly...
...with your blessing
and permission?
Do you need my blessing?
Who's going to
answer your brother?
Aunty Bhavani isn't well.
You're looking
after her on your own.
If we're with you, we'll help you.
-No.
Please think.
-I've decided. Bhavani too.
You're just
as stubborn as my brother.
Bhavani will not accept it.
-I asked for flowers...
You gave me a garden...
I asked for water...
You gave me honey...
I asked for flowers...
You gave me a garden...
I asked for water...
You gave me honey...
What should I ask...
What should I ask...
So that you'll give
yourself up...

Hi, aunty!
How are you?
Hi, uncle.
-Careful.
My sister-in-law.
-Who?
My sister-in-law.
Who else would call me?
Hello! I'm fine.
What I'm doing?
-Tell the truth.
I'm working.
How is brother?
Jaya girl?
-Who is that?
What? Hello!
Yes, I can hear you.
Taxi driver?
Which address?
You are here?
In Mumbai? What for?
They are in Mumbai!
Hello, driver!
Yes? Please come.
Been ages since I saw you.
Okay-
We're caught! We're dead!
They are coming here.
Now?
-My brother has a conference.
Why did you give the right
address to the taxi driver?
You're a fool.
Get up.
Where will you go now?
Why should I go?
-Are you joking?
My brother will get mad.
He's a control freak.
Shall I hide under the bed?
It won't work.
My sister-in-law will sniff you.
Go!
"No!
Get
"No!
What do you mean?
-I will not go from here.
When they come,
I'll say hello to them.
I'll say I'm Tara and
that I'm living in sin with Adi.
Then I'll go back to bed.
It's my sister-in-law.
Hello? You're here?
So fast? First floor.
Say it's the second floor.
We'll get another 5 minutes.
Love, please get up.
My love! Get up!
Don't be stubborn,
don't make a man beg.
They are only visiting.
If we play it right,
we can avoid problems.
Parsley, get up!
-What?
Okay, gongura. Get up.
Your brother is here.
Hi, Adi!
-Hi, brother.
How are you?
-First class!
Hi, Jaya!
Bill Gates, are you behaving?
-Yes.
No! Adi, we just had.
-Have another cup.
Coffee please.
Aunty Bhavani,
look who is here.
Hello, Mrs. Bhavani.
How are you?
Do you remember me?
Isn't Mr. Ganapathy home?
I'll tell you where he has gone.
Walking,
4 rounds around the park.
He'll buy papers back.
Right?
Mysore pak.
It seems Mr. Ganapathy loves it.
Who are they, Adi?
-Sister Saroja.
I'm Vasu, I worked
with Mr. Ganapathy in IOB.
Where are you staying?
-Me? Over here.
You met Saroja during the wedding.
You're just seeing Jaya.
Here?
-Have coffee first.
It's a bachelor's room,
it'll be dirty.
I know.
I have a confession.
There are many changes in life.
We'll talk later.
-I wanted to tell you.
Wait!
Your brother's room is so neat.
He's not dirty like you.
What is this?
Didn't you hide
any cigarette packs?
Not bad, Adi, you changed.
-it's your training.
You're late, Ganapathy.
-Another half a round.
Conference?
-Business plan review.
My branch sent me.
I'm going back tomorrow.
Welcome! Stay here,
don't go anywhere.
I told you so.
Here, Bhavani.
Maria, where are you going?
-I'll put these clothes...
...and come back.
-Fast.
Gamer, I'm waiting...
Gamer, I'm waiting...
Gamer...
Run!
Have you been doing this
ever since you got here?
He has been doing since birth.
Where are the bag guys?
Look behind!
I'm caught!
Vasu, this is Tara.
-Uncle Ganapathy's niece.
My niece?
-Yes.
Ganapathy has no niece.
Yes.
I'm Vasu, Mr. Ganapathy's
junior in the bank.
Adi's brother.
-Hi!
I saw her.
Did I disturb
your family reunion?
Aunty, your CD.
Adi, she's going into your room?
-My drawings are in there.
How did her drawing
get in there?
Mr. Ganapathy removed it.
It's under the bed!
Sit, uncle.
-Uncle, you have a life.
Let's play-
I think I left
my drawings at work.
Aunty, house key.
-Why?
Tara, where are you staying?
-Me?
Over here.
-Here.
Here?
-Here, where else?
I said I saw them.
She caught uncle...
-I'm late for work.
Get her an auto.
-I'll get one for her.
It's okay, I'll go.
I'm coming.
Mr. Ganapathy, you didn't
tell me you had a niece.
Ganapathy has no niece, Vasu.
I'm telling you, you don't get it?
Are you slow?
He is not fast enough.
-He's like that.
Thank you, sir.
-Slow in the bank too.
I'm first!
Daddy!
-Careful!
Bye, you don't have to come down.
-Why? I'll come with you.
Tara, come with me for a minute.
Close the door behind you.
Wait!
Adi!
-I'm Vasu.
What I wanted to say?
-You wanted to wish them...
...a safe journey.
-Bye!
Teach her singing or violin.
-Sure.
Okay!
There are many more
things in the bathroom.
What's happening here?
Looks like
you're blackmailing me.
If Vasu finds out, all hell
will break loose. He's...
A control freak?
-So?
You could have asked Adi.
I know you won't mind,
so I'm asking.
Can we get Tara married to Adi?
Will you consider it?
This is not right. It's good
if Adi and you get married.
I'll conduct the wedding.
Or, you can leave.
Don't get me wrong...
...will everything be okay
if there's a marriage certificate?
Saroja, we're late. We need
extra 30 minutes for traffic.
Let's go! Dad said this.
-Tell him I'm coming. Run!
Live in relationship
is an embarrassment.
It is not right at all.
Careful! Don't knock anywhere.
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, madam.
Think and let me know.
Talk to Tara's parent's too.
Ask Tara too. Just e-mail me.
Bye, madam.
Your sister-in-law
knows everything.
No.
-I'm not lying.
Really? How did she know?
-She is too inquisitive.
I don't think she knows.
She said your brother
will wreak havoc if he finds out.
You're lying.
You terrorising me.
She told me to marry you
or don't even look at you.
She then kissed my cheek
and left a bomb in my hand.
What did you say?
-That I'm going to Paris...
...and you're going to US.
We're not ready for commitment.
You told her everything?
Freedom!
Where are we going?
-You said you'll even follow...
...me to hell.
-Are we going to hell?
Come quietly.
-Okay, I won't open my mouth.
Is this a gynaecologist clinic?
Hi, Sujatha?
-Just a minute, ma'am.
Let me check.
-Okay.
What are we doing here?
Tests?
For Aunty Bhavani?
-Quiet!
Why is everyone here fat?
Columbus does
not understand yet?
Excuse me, ma'am. Please wait.
-Okay.
So many people are pregnant?
-Yes, loverboy.
Our people have
nothing better to do.
So what I'm thinking is true?
How do I know
what you're thinking?
The sample we brought
is not Bhavani's, it is Tara's.
100 marks.
You...
-We're only doing a test.
There is a possibility?
-Maybe.
Don't look as if
it's the end of the world.
What is the test is a 'yes'?
-What?
If it is positive?
-How would I know if you ask me?
The world is getting dark.
You were counting the days.
Tamil?
-Yes.
First time?
-Yes.
Don't escape after this visit.
Bring her here every month.
Don't give excuses
like my husband.
Have you gone for a scan?
I'm waiting with a full bladder.
I need to drink
another 3 glasses of water.
It's torture.
But I'll forget everything
once I see those tiny fingers...
...while scanning.
Bye! What happened?
Did you see any fingers?
Look at the results.
Why are there
so many lines here?
It looks like a plan.
We are doing renovation
for this clinic.
This is the approval
from the corporation.
I was only joking.
Did you get scared?
Joking? It was scary.
It'll take 10 days
for me to recover from this.
What is this?
-Our game, boss.
Who is this?
Villain, boss.
-You, boss.
Do I look like a villain?
-That's your twin, boss.
One good boss,
one bald boss.
Careful!
You're messing
with the mafia head?
I'll throw you out
from the train.
Don't kill me.
Help me!
Help!
You have another 4 weeks.
4 weeks of perfection.
Aren't you sleepy?
-No.
You can't sleep
if you're too happy.
The same goes when you're sad.
-Both for me.
Looks like my admission
from Paris will arrive soon.
You will leave him, right?
I feel like
I've lost something big.
Does he know?
Education and career,
are they important for you?
Or is he important?
If you asked me 6 months ago,
I would have chosen my career.
But now I'm greedy.
I feel like I want both.
What happened?
Why are you packing?
I'm packing my clothes.
-Tara, what happened?
I'm leaving.
-Why?
Useless girl!
-I'm going out.
I'll be back in 2 days.
I thought something else
and got scared.
What do you mean?
-I thought you found out...
...about Dimple and Sanggetha.
-Cheapskate!
Where are you going?
-Jaipur, with Mr. Doshi.
I hate that man.
-He is 87 years old.
Why can't he take an assistant
who is 86 years old?
Why take my Kanmani (love)?
Soon, you'll be somewhere else,
I'll be somewhere else.
So?
-We can't fight for our rights.
Okay?
"Okay
But don't leave me now.
-Hands off.
I feel like holding an intelligent
woman and sleeping.
So don't run away
with an 87 year old man.
Take your hands off!
Manage with your
Dimple and Sanggetha.
Okay, bye!
I don't like that Doshi.
I hate the assistant
who is following him.
I wish to say this
to the Hindi people of Mumbai.

Where are you?
Not even one miss call.
Uncle!
-Yes?
Where is Adi?
-He went with you.
No, he didn't come with me.
He didn't follow you?
Where did he go these 2 days?
He didn't come home either.
-He went back. He'll be back.
Take the plates out,
food is ready.
I'll be back later.
Hello, Ananya, is Adi there?
Where is he?
I can't reach him.
I told him not to go
anywhere for this game.
He didn't listen.
Did he get caught in
the underworld?
Quiet! Tara, wait,
I'll be back with him.
He)', what happened?
It has been 2 days.
Tara!
-I know.
We should not have expectations
in a live-in relationship.
We should not
tie each other up.
We must give
independence, I know.
Not that, he'll be back.
When he does, you shouldn't
yell like a conventional wife.
Okay?
Adi?
+11.
Where are you?
-Come out, I'll tell you.
Fast, I'm waiting.
Where are you?
Don't wait for the lift,
it's too slow.
Take the staircase.
-What happened?
Where are you?
Stop! Walk straight.
You'll see a glass door.
Adi, if I see you,
I'll kill you.
Hi, you can cut the call now.
Sit, let's eat.
Where did you go?
Can we sit and talk?
Why such an expensive place?
-You won't throw a fit here.
Why did you go
without telling me?
You could have called me.
Would you have lost your pride
if you had informed me?
When I asked your friend,
he said you'd be with...
...your underworld friends.
When I called your sister-in-law,
she is asking me other things.
Uncle Ganapathy
did not know anything.
Only Aunty Bhavani kept saying
you are around and having dosa.
I couldn't do anything for 2 days.
I even went to the police.
What am I to think?
-There is vodka in that.
Don't talk.
Where did you go?
You won't guess.
-Where?
Coimbatore.
Coimbatore?
-Yes.
What for?
My mother?
-Who else?
Would 'Pollachi Mahalinggam'
call me?
She sent someone to get me.
-If she called, why did you go?
Qidft 'Yam F? .93?-
I'm from West Mambalam, I haven't
even seen a private jet before.
A small plane for 6.
The air hostess was a girl from
Assam, Pinky, a tribal beauty.
I was picked up in an Audi 8
from Coimbatore Airport.
Why did she call you?
She showed me her factory,
office, estate, race cars...
...bungalow and everything.
She said, they belonged to you.
What else did she say?
-She asked me...
...what you saw in me.
What did you see in me?
Did she threaten you?
Did she say she knew
all the police officers?
She said that
she's always observing you.
She said that she knew
that you went to Jaipur.
What would you like to eat?
Pasta, pizza or antipasti?
Thank you, we'll be back.
I'm very upset.
I look cool from the outside.
Look here.
-I can still hear you.
Are we husband and wife?
Why are we fighting?
Joke of the year!
The whole of Mumbai
knows we are fighting.

Our first argument. I'm going

-Even God won't endure this.
Your joke is foolish.
He doesn't like jokes?
He looks upset.
Aunty Bhavani!
Aunty Bhavani,
this is too much.
What happened? Why are
you sitting in the rain?
Didn't you go home?
-What happened?
I forgot the way.
-To go home?
I forgot the way.
-To go home?
Come on.
-Let's go.
I fell down into the valley...
You took me to the peak...
I fell into the water...
You took me to the shore...

You'll reach out to me...
I asked for flowers...
You gave me the park...
I asked for water...
You gave me honey...
What did the doctor say?
He said you must listen to me
and take your medicine on time.
Don't lie.
Someone keeps
yelling inside my head.
I forget what I want to say.
I don't recognise anyone.
I'm forgetting my music.
How can you lie
that I'll recover?
They told you to be strong.
-Don't treat me like a fool.
I'm losing my memory
but I can still think.
Alzheimer, second stage.
Will I forget you one day?
Vanakkam.
I'm Chandrika, Tara's mother.
We came to discuss marriage.
Hello, how are you?
-Hey, Bill Gates!
Go to MakeMyTrip.Com...
...take the first cheapest
flight from Mumbai to Chennai.
Why?
Is this why I educated you
and sent you to Mumbai?
Why?
What's the problem?
A big problem called Chandrika
is sitting in front of me.
Who is this Chandrika?
There is a raaga
called Chandrika Todi.
Tara's mother.
-Who is Tara?
Good morning.
-Chandrika's daughter.
I'm going to smack you!
I don't want this joke from you!
You told me Tara
was Ganapathy niece.
Like a niece.
Once you get to Chennai Airport,
there'll be a pharmacy there.
Sardarji's shop.
Get 4 BP tablets and come home.
No, Tara is like
Uncle Ganapathy's niece.
Ganapathy is old and dim.
He is acting with you.
Have you become dim?
Vasu, you won't
find a better girl...
...than Tara for your brother.
Sorry, sir,
I didn't know you were there.
We were talking...
The dim Ganapathy is talking
to the senseless Vasu.
Listen up.
Senseless Vasu!
Go to Shiva Vishnu
Temple and pray.
Pray the girl marries
your brother and stays with...
...him till the end.
-That won't be necessary.
The girl's mother
is here in my house.
Look.
Mom!
-Don't be angry.
Why did you go
and propose marriage?
Stay on the line.
Stay on the line.
Did I say I want to get married?
-Right.
Why are you interfering?
-Get in!
You live in with a boy.
Must I keep quiet?
You didn't keep quiet?
You took him to Coimbatore
and threatened him.
Don't talk about that.
-I didn't take anyone.
I didn't threaten anyone.
-Mom, I know everything.
Tara, I said
I did not threaten anyone.
Really?
-Is that the problem now?
When I found out, I told 2
of my friends to investigate.
That's all.
-Who are they, mom?
The police commissioner, right?
-There goes!
Have a daughter,
then you'll know the feeling.
Is it the police commissioner?
-Tara, our stop is here. Let's go.
When I found out that you're
in love with the guy...
...I told them to check out
his education and family.
You said you went to Coimbatore,
Audi and private jet.
I saw it, your mom
showed me through Skype.
But he's from the middle class,
that's not an issue.
Where were you the 2 days?
-What's the difference?
Where were you?
-Mother-in-law's house (jail).
Were you in the lockup?
Mom, did you make Adi
stay in the lockup?
Tara, I didn't do anything
against your wish.
Did you put him
in the lockup or not?
When I found out you picked
a good guy, I went to their house.
I fixed your marriage, that's all.
-They took me on Friday.
I couldn't get
bail until Monday.
They gave me a feast in jail.
In the jail?
-There were many VIPs there.
Mom, I'll call you back.
The commissioner took me to
his house and gave me breakfast.
Aloo parottha, yogurt and
pickles. It was great.
We became friends.
He said I won't have a problem
during my visa application.
Why didn't you tell me
my mother did this to you?
Don't worry
like what Buddy says.
I used the jail
experience in my game.
Want to watch the demo?
Come to my office.
Come on!
There is no one here.
-I don't know. Where are they?
I'm like the game...
Run...
I'm despicable...
Game...
Goa or Mumbai...
Mumbai...
Adi, my love, come here!
The project
was approved in the US.
You're going to the US.
It's hard for me.
How would Tara feel?
My biggest mistake.
-What?
Tara.
My little secret...
My little secret...
My little wonder...
Give me your tiny finger...
Give me a tiny space...
I can't lie for small desires...
Shall I reject the US offer?
-Quiet!
I can't leave Tara behind.
"Just say it, Adi won't go the US,
he'll stay with you."
My little secret...
My little wonder...
Give me your tiny finger...
Give me a tiny space...
I can't lie
for small desires...
Please stop here.
-What happened, Tara?
How much?
-Rs17
Why are you upset now?
I'm sad because
I'm not like you.
You're going to leave me soon.
Do you feel sad at all?
You're dancing away happily,
like this and that.
Why do I feel sad?
-Do you want me to feel sad?
Did you stop
to think a minute?
Don't go to Paris,
let's just stay like this.
Every minute.
I didn't like it
when I got the admission.
That is why
I didn't tell you.
Follow me to the US.
You follow me to Paris.
That's tough.
It's tough for me too.
The best time of my life
were these 6 months.
When I was with you.
Let's not destroy it.
Okay-
What do you mean?
We'll make an agreement.
-What?
We have a few days left.
-10 days.
We can fight, cry,
yell and leave each other.
We can feel sorry
for each other the next 10 days.
Or we need not think about
the future, we'll enjoy.
We shouldn't fight these 10 days,
no matter what happens, okay?
Promise?
-No crying either.
There shouldn't be sentiment,
separation or sadness.
No sleeping.
-Okay.
We should stay awake.
Laugh, go out and have fun.
We'll go wild, okay?
-Done.
Done?
-Done!
Go fast!
Hold the steering!
Assume this is our house.
-All the rooms are our bedrooms.
One dog, you get scared
when he barks.
Kids?
Just for one day,
we'll adopt a child.
His name, Glutton.
He looks like a sumo wrestler.
What if its a girl?
-A pretty girl, just like you.
What will you do
when you go to the US?
I'll go to a strip club.
Tell me what I'll do.
-What will you do?
I don't know.
I'll waste my time thinking
what you'll be doing.
Can you listen?
The clock is ticking away.
Don't think about it.
Only 8 days left.
Tell me, "Don't cry, Tara."
Tell me.

I'm sleepy.
If you ask me now,
I'll say something foolish.
Say something nice.
No, we promised each other
there won't be any sentiment.
Not this one minute.
Tell me from the
bottom of your heart.
Okay, I'll tell you.
How will it be to eat
one hot omelette right now?
Great.
You're right.
Remove the chain
from your neck.
Quick, remove it.
I love you.
Hey! I love you.
I didn't think you're the
sort who buys gifts.
It was an accident.
Forgive me, Kanmani.
Are you settling
your accounts before we go?
Is that it?
Tara?
-Then what?
You've never given me a gift.
If you don't like it,
we'll return it back.
Must we fight
in front of these pigeons?
You're telling me to let you go,
you wrapped and brought it here.
She will not fight with me.
You're closing
Tara Kalingarayar's chapter.
She will not scold me.
She will remain sweet.
I'm telling you
how I feel, Adi.
You're bottling up
your feeling...
...you're discarding me
with a smiling face.
You knew you would have
to say goodbye, love...
But my love for you
will not reduce...
Sorry.
Is this pretty?
My boyfriend bought it for me.
Do you like it?
I thought we promised
each other that we won't cry.
I'm not crying.
Then what is flowing out
from your eyes?
Happiness?
-Okay, so what?
Focus on the road.
Don't look at me.
Let me do whatever I want.
Even if I look in front,
I can still hear you crying.
You keep finding my fault.
Whatever I do is wrong.
I did not mean that.
-You are.
Okay, I'm not saying anything.
Zip!
Uncle Ganapathy is preparing
dinner for you today.
He told me not to eat out,
he wants you home.
He told me too.
-Don't pick on me during dinner.
When did I do that?
-I only said don't pick on me.
Did I say you did it?
-Why are you fighting now?
Okay, I won't say
anything. Zip!
Aunty Bhavani!
Uncle Ganapathy!
Aunty Bhavani!
-Uncle Ganapathy!
I'll go down and look.
-I'll come with you.
Did you see Uncle Ganapathy?
-Aunty went off alone.
We don't know where she went.
He went to look for her.
Stop! Go slow!
It's not them.
Try calling Uncle Ganapathy.
His phone is charging at home.
-We made a mistake.
We should have convinced uncle
to leave aunty in a hospital.
Aunty said she won't go
to the hospital anymore.
That's what she'll say.
-Uncle will listen to you...
...or to aunty?
-She even forgets...
...who is Uncle Ganapathy.
Why did he listen to her?
Wait in the car. Do something
if you see the police.
I'll go and look.
Aunty Bhavani!
Aunty Bhavani!
She is...
Where did she go?
One minute, sir. My wife...
-Go!
It's an emergency, she's missing,
I'm looking for her.
You cannot wait here!
-Tara!
Move!
Go!
Only you can open
from inside.
Where did you go?
-I was looking in the market.
I told you not to leave.
Only you have a right to search?
What if she was in the market?
Can't you wait for 2 minutes?
-The police yelled at me in Hindi.
You can't handle a constable.
But you're scolding me.
Go left.
I told you to go left.
-it's a no entry zone.
Then go around.
-That's what I'm doing.
Why are you yelling?
You're leaving for the US.
Then you can shout
anyway you want.
I'll do anything I want.
Just leave me alone.
Are you blind?
Yes, scold me,
that's what I need.
Uncle Ganapathy!
Uncle Ganapathy!
Uncle Ganapathy!
Who are you?
You jumped from the car?
Someone looked
like Uncle Ganapathy.
Get in!
Close the door.
Slowly.
-Why are you jumping at me?
I'm scared just like you.
If you jump from the car
while it's moving...
...won't I get angry?
What if the bus had hit you?
-Nothing happened.
You can't say anything
once it happens.
Okay, drop me here. I'll go
on my own and look for them.
Then who is going
to look for you?
What now?
You were worried that
I would have got hit just now.
Then who will go to Paris?
If you care about me,
just say so.
Why are you yelling?
-Who is yelling now?
Why are you going home?
-To check if they are back.
Is Aunty Bhavani back?
-No.
Don't cry.
-Aunty Bhavani...
...forgets who she is.
What if she
forgets the way home?
How will we look for her?
You won't be able
to find her by crying.
Can we find her
if I don't cry?
I'll do what I want.
Don't bother about me
Look around while you cry.
Okay?
"Okay
Pity Uncle Ganapathy.
No one will look
after her like he does.
Not true.
-Why? He doesn't do a good job?
Is that why Aunty Bhavani
goes missing all the time?
No, others can
look after her just like him.
Are you talking about yourself?
I'm being general.
Can you be like him?
-Yes.
What if I become like
Aunty Bhavani when I'm old?
I'll look after you.
Will you?
What do you mean?
I'm telling you
not to leave me.
I'm asking you to marry me.
You can go anywhere, you can
go to Paris for all I care.
But marry me first.
Will you do it?
There she is.
Aunty Bhavani!
Aunty Bhavani!
Where is Ganapathy?
-He is here.
Where is Ganapathy?
-He is at home.
Let's go.
Ganapathy, where did you go?
I was worried about you.
I searched all over for you.
I won't do it again, Bhavani.
Let's go.
SQ?
You said something
in the car.
I'll say it again.
Really?
Yes.
Do you want
to get married to me?
You don't have
to stop studying.
You can still go to Paris.
But marry me before you go.
I'll come and join you.
Really?
Yes.
Marriage?
Marriage.
100%?
Yes.
Okay-
Okay?
Okay-
Okay, Kanmani!
With an insane heart...
Young and naughty...
With a beautiful tune...
Okay on my girl's lap...
With an insane heart...
Young and naughty...
With a beautiful tune...
Okay on my girl's lap...
Yesterday is gone...
Tomorrow is a pain...
Just like my Laila...
We're the king
and queen today...
With an insane heart...
Young and naughty...
With a beautiful tune...
Okay on my girl's lap...
Don't pinch with your eyes...
Don't go without disturbing...
Don't jump when I touch...
Don't go
even if I leave you...
Marriage, wife and in-laws...
Girl and boy...
Love...
With an insane heart...
Young and naughty...
With a beautiful tune...
Okay on my girl's lap...
With an insane heart...
Young and naughty...
With a beautiful tune...
Okay on my girl's lap...
Yesterday is gone...
Tomorrow is a pain...
Just like my Laila...
We're the king
and queen today...
Just like your Laila...
We got married...
I give you permission...
I keep stepping forward...
I fall on your lap...
We may go separate ways...
But unknowingly,
we are always one...
At times we laugh...
We fly most of the time...
With an insane heart...
Young and naughty...
With a beautiful tune...
Okay on my girl's lap...
With an insane heart...
Young and naughty...
With a beautiful tune...
Okay on my girl's lap...
Yesterday is gone...
Tomorrow is a pain...
Just like your Laila...
We're the king
and queen today...
With an insane heart...
Young and naughty...
With a beautiful tune...
Okay on my girl's lap...
Like your Laila...
Like your Laila...
