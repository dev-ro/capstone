Let's go! A1! -There's a pulse.
Code green.
We're going to intubate this guy
and fix the hole in his heart.
Got it!
Looks tight. Pressure is holding.
Okay, call CT surgery, tell them
they've got a sick one coming up.
Where's the bedroom?
-This is your bedroom.
And your kitchen, your dining room, your
study... It's 'real' New York living.
And there's a bonus. The
view is amazing! Go ahead.
This is a great view? -Interested?
APARTMENT FOR RENT
Excuse me.
Hi! Someone called about a rental here.
It's not ready yet. -Could I see it?
You're looking at it.
I can't afford this. -It's 38.
What? -The place is 38.
thousand?
3,800.
Alright, what's the catch? Are you planning
a nightclub down on the first floor?
The utility will be separated. It takes
a lot to heat up a place like this.
So, expect comet to stick
it to you in the winter time.
Right. -This'll be the
best view in the building.
Are you the 'super'? -Owner, actually.
Right.
- My family bought this building in the '40s...
...and to answer your question,
'No', there is no nightclub.
One of my tenants started to move
out so I'm renovating the apartment.
Until then, it could get
a little noisy down here.
I don't mind noise. I
am an ER doctor, so...
...when we sleep, we really sleep.
Well, a couple things about the building. Er...
it doesn't give the best cell phone reception.
Okay... Er... I can give that up.
And there's the 'F' line.
A maintenance track that runs directly
under the building but usually at night.
Alright, I'm gonna need your Social
Security number and three references.
Oh, I can get you all of that including records
of my taxes for the last 5 years if you like.
I prefer no pets. -Of course.
Alright, the heaters bang
loudly in the morning.
You haven't check my
references. -I will.
Take a look around.
I'll get back to work.
I've got to be uptown
in exactly 100 minutes.
See, you've got 60 to get this
shit out of this rented truck...
...or I've got to charge
you for another day.
Take a deep breath. I don't want
you to strain yourself talking.
You hired the only movin' guy in New York who
doesn't actually move furnitures? -Yeah, right.
Well, you travel pretty light.
-I've got rid of all that.
Light 'tll I saw the bed
in half and burned it.
But I need a place to sleep tonight.
Not easy at forgiving. -Change is good.
Shall we go and get that mattress?
Huh, Hi! -This is my grandfather,
August, Juliet...Juliet, August.
She is our new tenant.
Got any pets? -No.
Are you loud? -No, not at all.
Sorry, I scared you.
Nice to meet you.
This is Crystal Meth. 10 mg. Biotin.
Don't do anything, please! -Calm
down, it's gonna be alright.
No, don't test me out!
No. -It's gonna be alright.
Heard you had a long one.
Hmmm...that was an insane day.
Rob and I are going out today. You wanna come? -No thanks.
I think I'm just gonna go home and get to bed early.
JACK: "YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING
MY CALLS. CAN WE TALK?"
You've got to stop thinking about him.
-The love of my life cheated on me...
...in my own bed.
Always when I look at myself, all
I see is someone who wasn't enough.
You were enough. You are enough.
More than enough. He's an asshole.
I gave up my dream to
move to New York city...
...to be his. And he
just threw all away.
It is an 'eye-opening'.
It's not going to kill you.
And you're going!
We can handle this. It's gonna cost you a
little extra because of all the unused space.
Grandfather doesn't want to change
the integrity of the structure.
Okay, no problem. I'll take care of it.
Alright, Thank you.
Hi! About to start
making a lot of noise?
If I get the city's approval there.
A lot has to be done around here.
Yeah, I bet. Oh, thank you for the gift.
It was so kind and really thoughtful.
The gift that was
outside my door yesterday?
That wasn't me. -August?
There you are.
Hi! I wanted to thank you for
incredibly thoughtful gift.
I'm just putting myself in your shoes.
I thought if I were a woman
alone in a new apartment...
...surrounded by strangers,
what would I want?
I don't have much company.
Oh, I'm sorry, I should really go.
Thanks.
Great.
Max! I didn't recognize you
outside the building. -Who is this?
This is Max. This is
Sydney, we work together.
Very nice to meet you, Sydney.
-Nice to meet you too, Max.
I haven't heard about you.
Hmmm... nice day, isn't it? -It is.
Sometimes I feel all I ever do is
work... I don't know... I decided to stop.
...come out and feel Brooklyn, you know.
Well, Max would you like to have a drink with us?
-No, no thanks. I'm actually getting ready to leave.
It was very nice to
meet you. -Me too, Max.
He is my 'landlord'. -So?!
I am his 'tenant'. -You
mean, what if he sucks...
...and you can't get away from each
other. -Yeah, it's not recommended.
So you've thought about it! -Shhh...
Hey Max, do you actually... Do you
mind walking me home? -I love to.
Goodbye. See ya. -He's cute.
Thanks.
Bye, guys.
August, er... he worries about me.
People from his generation were married
with ten kids by the time they were my age.
He's a kind of unique guy, isn't
he? -That's one way to put it.
Unique, difficult, a pain in the ass
would be another way to categorize him.
Is he okay?
Up until a year ago we were
partners in the building.
We did everything together, fixed everything
together, made all the decisions together.
Then he had a stroke.
And what about your parents?
They died when I was very young.
What about your family?
My parents, they are kind
of 'after-the-facts' hippies.
I guess that makes you the black
sheep of the family, huh? -Definitely.
Yeah, for me, 'Rebellion'
was going to Med school.
'Free love' just sucked
as far as I could tell.
Led to a quick divorce and my parents parted,
so, I was every other weekend with my dad.
I never really knew where my home was.
Not until Jack and I moved in together.
Jack? -My ex.
I thought all hippie
kids had weird names.
Oh, you do, don't you?
What's your real name?
Juliet, that's my real name.
-What's your middle name?
Wanna sit here? -Are
you Ignoring my question?
No, I just thought we
take in the view. -Okay.
When I was little, I used to walk
around the neighbourhood at night ...
...and looked into windows of
families from televisions ...
...brothers, sisters, parents...
...eating, you know, talking.
And I knew I couldn't have that, but ...
...just watching them, somehow,
made me feel like I was part of it.
Seeing all these families is sweet.
Bliss.
-Bliss? -Yup!
Dr. Bliss.
Dr. Bliss.
Yup. -Very nice.
Thank you.
Sorry. -No, don't be sorry, Juliet.
I'm an idiot. Of course it's a bad idea.
It's not what I mean.
I'm just confused.
Reading the wrong signal.
Jesus Christ. Juliet,
calm the fuck down.
I don't know what I was expecting. -You
were expecting 'rebound' sex, honey.
Hot landlord 'rebound' sex!
See you later.
-'Bye doll.
Jack.
"You picked up".
What do you want?
-"I just called to say, 'Hi'".
Well, Hi!
"Can I see you?"
"Juliet I'm sorry". -I gotta go.
I don't think it's good idea for us to talk yet.
-"Juliet, it's Max".
Max?
-"Listen, eh, sorry about yesterday".
"Well, I was wondering if I can make
it up to you with dinner tonight?"
You like old things. -As long as I do.
You know, I'm not really one of
the 'text-message' twitter crowd.
Technology seems to be about telling
everybody your deep dark secrets.
I don't know, I guess I think
'secrets' should be 'secrets'.
What?
It's just... starting to feel like home.
Safe, warm and inviting.
You did it for me.
Good.
So, what's your 'secret'?
Why aren't you married?
I guess I just never found
anyone that... -Anyone that...
You 'got' me, I guess. Not that I got.
And the truth is, I'm not very social.
You know, it's probably
the way I grew up.
I spent my whole life taking
care of my family's building...
...and recently, my
grandfather. Because of that...
...I've never had a
relationship that mattered.
You know, going to that Art
Opening thing the other day...
That was a 'big deal' for me.
I'm sorry about that day.
-No, I was just surprised ...
...that you ... -That I what?
That you wanted to kiss me.
Why wouldn't I?
'Landlord'.
-'Tenant'.
Messed up.
I have a pulse.
He thought he was dying.
It's not a stroke, is it?
I called it Schizophreniform.
He should see a psychiatrist.
Are you okay? -Yeah.
Someone called about a rental here?
Excuse me. -Max.
This is Max. This is
Sydney, we work together.
Sometimes I feel all I ever do is
work... I don't know... I decided to stop.
...come out and feel Brooklyn, you know.
Hey Max, do you actually...
Do you mind walking me home?
Sorry. I'm just confused.
Reading the wrong signal.
Sorry, God, I'm an idiot.
Of course, it's a bad idea.
I'm confused. Reading the wrong signal.
Jesus Christ. Juliet,
calm the fuck down.
Max? -Huh.
Max, I can't do this.
I can't do this. I can't
get him out of my mind.
Jack... I still only know his smell.
And the way he touches me, I...
I don't want it to be like this.
I see.
Do you understand, right?
I'll call you later.
I know everything that
goes on in this building.
I know everything that
goes on in your head.
You think I don't know
how your brain works?
Just like your father.
Jealous and perverted. -That's enough.
Your mother, she was beautiful.
She married a weak man.
Then, she gave birth to another.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
-Yeah, I'm sorry. I suddenly felt weird.
It had nothing to do with
you. I just need more time.
That's okay, it tells me that you
take being with someone seriously.
And I like that.
Well, you know, I was
thinking about it and ...
Maybe we shouldn't have
done that, you know.
Meaning that we live
in the same building.
Really? -No offence, but I just...
I just needed company, I guess.
-I'm so glad you feel the same way.
It's been a lot to me
the last couple of weeks.
I should go. -Yeah, okay.
Okay... We'll see.
Have a nice day. -You too.
What is the matter with you?
Why didn't you stand up for yourself?
Just like your father.
Your mother, she was beautiful.
She married a weak man.
Then, she gave birth to another.
This place is driving me crazy.
And I thought I knew
everything about this building.
I never realize your kitchen
had an old wine closet.
August's old place had one of this, but
they must have covered this up years ago.
I think it's really cool. Can I use it?
Absolutely. I'll fix this up for
you and get it out of your hair.
But I have to work. -Hey,
I can do while you're gone.
That's really sweet of you. Thanks
for being such a good friend.
JACK: "HI DOC. I MISS YOU... TRUCE?"
Hi, no...er...Let me help you
with this. -No, that's okay, I...
No, I should help you. -That's sweet.
Er... it goes in the kitchen?
Yeah. -Okay, Good, Yeah.
You've got a lot of stuff!
You're...eh...cooking? -Yeah.
Maybe I'll stay and help, yeah?
-You don't have to do that.
Juliet, I wanted to try to
speak to you about something.
It's been a little confusing to
me. Because you kissed me first.
What? -Yeah, You made the first move.
You kissed me first and now you're
acting like nothing happened.
I'm sorry. We were just getting
to know each other, you know...
...to see if things work or didn't.
I mean, That's what people do.
I don't do that.
You shouldn't do that either.
Yeah, ten minutes is perfect.
Alright, I'll see you then. 'Bye.
Aw... oh, Emily! Hi,
I missed you so much.
What happened to her? -She has been
picking up a fight with a German shepherd.
I didn't know what to bring to a dinner like
this, but... -Thank you, they're beautiful.
We'll sit here in the living
room. -This place is huge.
And cheap. -How much?
3,800.
Anything available for me?
I'm not quite ready for that.
Right.
Thanks.
How about the German Shepherd? -She had been
having a hard time at the Doggie Day Care.
Why do you need a Doggie Day Care? -I've
been travelling a lot in the last few weeks.
It was business. -I
wasn't thinking that.
Look, I could tell you
everything. -I don't want to know.
You were never home. I
literally never saw you.
So tell me you slept with someone
else because I won't do it.
I was with someone else.
It was just a flirtation, but
it felt amazing for a moment.
I want you to be clear about something.
It was nice but it was never you.
It's the guy with the beard, right?
How do you know that?
I followed you one night and I was going to
ring your bell, but... -You followed me home.
I wasn't good anymore.
My life without you... I missed you.
I've missed you too, Jack.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry dinner burned.
Never mind.
I want you to stay. -I can't,
I've got to get up at 7am.
I am in no way prepared.
I'm gonna be up all night.
Wanna keep Emily tonight?
No pets allowed. -Here, keep this.
I love you. Alright, come on.
So, what's going on? I
heard you were late again.
Yeah, I slept with my alarm 3 times
in 2 weeks and I never oversleep.
So, you've been out late? -No, no, there's
something creepy about my apartment.
The guy gives you a gorgeous
apartment at an unbelievable price.
He cooks for you and is an absolute
gentleman. And that's creepy? -No...
There's something about it, I can't wake up
in the morning and I don't know this feeling.
If I were you, I would keep the
apartment and get a louder alarm.
There are cool features
triggered by movement.
So any activity in your apartment will
be recorded after 10 minutes intervals.
It is a wireless system which can
be accessed through your computer.
This position and the position in your living room,
will cover as much of the apartment as possible.
But that still leaves the kitchen
and the bathroom uncovered.
That's okay. As long as I have
the front door of my bedroom.
You've got that.
These things have automatic night
visions. So, no need to leave the light on.
These babies will get
anything that moves!
So, you're going to
sub-let? -I'm sorry, what?
Most people put this in if they're going to
sub-let, have a party or even for baby-sitters.
So that nobody steals anything.
-Yeah, I might sub-let.
Here we go.
That's it. Call if you
have any questions. -Thanks.
Grandfather. -Max, what are you doing?
It's my life now!
I'm sorry that we have to rush.
Call me when you get home. I love you.
Hi! This is Juliet Dermer. I'm sorry.
Somehow, I seriously overslept ...
I'll be there in an hour.
"YOU HAVE 7 NEW RECORDINGS."
I need a TRO on these
ASAP, please. -Okay, got it.
JACK: "HEY BABY DINNER
AT YOUR PLACE AROUND 7PM."
Thanks.
This is Juliet. -I faxed the
toxicology report you ordered.
Great, thanks.
"HIGH LEVELS OF DEMEROL, VALMID AND VALIUM
FOUND IN THE BLOOD AND URINE SAMPLES."
Jack, don't go to my apartment! I don't
know how it happened, but somehow...
Jack?
Juliet! hi there!
You just get home? -Yeah.
Look what I've found. This great old
bottle of wine from August's wine closet.
How... how to open it? -No
need. I already cracked it.
Wine had to 'breathe' a little
bit. Mind? -No, that's great.
You had a rough day, Juliet?
Yeah. -Right here.
Drink this. Maybe it'll help. -Thanks.
Sit down.
To our friendship.
Cheers.
You're not gonna try it? -I'm not eh...
Juliet, are you okay?
It's just that I'm exhausted,
I'm not really sleeping well.
I like this wine a lot, it's cool.
I'll be right back.
Juliet, will you please
put your phone down?
Why are you calling him?
Where is he?
Why did you give him
keys to my building.
Do you know where he is? -Why
did you betray me, Juliet?
Sit down!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Juliet. -What did
you do to him? What did you do?
Hey, Juliet... You're so beautiful.
This time you get to be awake,
This time you get to remember.
Help!
Help!.
Come on.
Hello!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?!
You bitch!
There's nowhere for you to go!
Juliet...
...I saw you!
You could pull me out of these walls.
I didn't want this. I
didn't want this at all.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry!
I was never gonna hurt you.
But you fucking betrayed me!!!
