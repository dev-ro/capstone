You must mean your asshole!

No academy means. We can watch

Spread your legs.
You missed it

They showed a real funny parrot...
lt could talk and sing like this
The school quack quack,
bell ding ding

HanByul! HanByul!
Hurry, Mom's here!
- Get up!
- Did you skip the academy again!
l knew something smelled fishy.
l caught you this time!
HanByul said
he wasn't feeling well...
Get up! You're always
pretending to be sick!
Bring me my switch!
How many times has it been?
Didn't l give you
an earful last week?
You should be helping your
younger brother with his homework!
lnstead you're always skipping
academy classes!
The teacher's complaining that
Hani never does his homework!
Why are you making life
so difficult for me?
You should be more helpful
at such busy times!
l'm sorry, Mom.
Promise you'll do better?
Go to your room and
study your lessons.
JANG Hani!
Get your butt over here!
HanByul!
What's wrong!
Look at me!
HanByul, What's wrong?
My body feels like rubber.
l can't get up.
l'm really sick, mom.
How many do you see
at the tip?
Two.
- We'll do a CAT Scan.
- Call the CAT Scanning Room.
Oops! Be careful.
- Patron for JANG HanByul!
- Yes.
Come in.
Take those shoes off!
Stop bothering your brother!
l told you to be careful!
HanByul, sit over there.
Wanna hear about
the fart brothers?
Once upon a time, there lived two
fart monsters, HanByul and Hani.
HanByul's farts were so smelly,
and Hani's were so loud.
You could hear it
50,000m away...
This white mass is a tumor.
lt's already quite progressed.
The mass...
Do you mean cancer?
Yes, the correct term is
'brain tumor.'
His eyesight has become
severely limited.
We must remove the tumor
as soon as possible.
The fart brothers were walking
up a hill when villains jumped out!
The brothers quickly aimed
their asses
and fired fart bombs at them!
Bang, Bang Bang!
Then l'll go...
Hey, that's gross...
lt's Dad!
- Hani!
- Dad!
Mommy smacked me and
said she would take my sneakers.
She did?
Are you done with
the examination?
Yes
Why so glum?
HanByul!
What's Dad's nickname?
Ha Ha Man!
Right! Ha Ha Man.
HanByul, give me a big smile.
Smile!
Your sleeves are so long
looks funny.
We can fold them up.
Mom, l'm sick, right?
lt's true, isn't it?
Yes, you are.
lt's true, HanByul!
l told you he was sick!
Didn't l?
You're such a dummy,
Mommy.
Hey~
Hani.
Your brother's really sick.
You know that, right?
No!
l'm giving this
to your brother.
Whenever you're mean to Hanbyul,
l'm having him write it down.
Your punishment
will be whippings.
Okay?
Here, HanByul.
Don't worry.
l'm glad we discovered it now.
What?
The surgery and chemotherapy
will make him well. And...
How can you say that?
You sound like a stranger!
- Don't be upset.
- You're always like this.
Always playing around
with the kids
While l'm... snapping at him for
throwing up in the new car.
Whipping him for skipping
academy classes...
accusing him for lying ...
What did you do then?
When our son was going blind,
What did you do?
What l am gonna do...
What l am gonna do...
Stop it!
l said, stop!
Thank you.
How's my boy?
Have this, and this.
My son.
Eat up.
l want you and my JoonTae
to be good friends.
This is dessert.
l made it myself.
- Ah, you mean Sebastian?
- Huh?
Hi, TaeWoong!
- Eat up!
- Yes, Ma'am.
Tadahh!
l'm fasting!
Fasting?
What's that?
- l can't eat anything.
- How come?
l have an operation tomorrow.
l can't eat anything before it.
Operation?
They're gonna do...
- this to your belly?
- Not my belly but up here.
l've got a bad bump
inside my head.
They're opening my head up,
and cutting it out.
Shit!
You are dead!
Hani, you've found your way
here by yourself!
l am not stupid! l just had to get
on the shuttle bus...
What's that?
Dad! lt looks real funny.
Just shave it all off.
Are you sure?
Everything?
l am doing it.
l'm doing it for real!
Mom.
Huh?
Are you staying for
the operation?
Yes... From now on,
l don't have to go to work.
Mommy will be with you.
You'll take a long nap,
and the operation will be over.
Mom, l'm a little scared.
You look like an alien.
- Be strong, son.
- Bye!
Shitty pants.
HanByul, can you hear me?
Look at your mommy.
What's his night reflection?
- Prompt, sir.
- Huh.
- His vital signs?
- Positive, sir.
HanByul! HanByul!
lt's mommy. Can you see me?
Who's this?
Who is it?
Shitty pants!
Scaredy cat!
- Good job! HanByul!
- Thank you.
The doctor says your operation
went well. Don't worry.
l'm so proud of you.
Good boy.
- You did good.
- Scaredy cat!
Don't catch a cold.
And always keep yourself clean.
Or else you won't be allowed
to play with your brother.
- Okay?
- You shouldn't use HanByul's towel.
HanByul, l'm applying an antiseptic
solution. lt'll feel a bit cold.
Just bear with me, okay?
Which book are you reading
these days?
You seem to focus
on reading.
HanByul, she's asking
what book you're reading.
He's reading 'Harry Potter.'
He's read it before...
You must be thrilled to be
leaving the hospital.
What are you planning
for summer vacation?
We're going to the mountains.
We're gonna swim
and sleep in tents.
Aren't we, HanByul?
When are we going to
the mountains?
HanByul, you should have
answered her question.
l have to collect bugs.
lt's my vacation assignment!
She just wanted to
hear your voice...
You keep making me
answer for you!
How many times
it has been?
You answer her next time!
Why do l have to keep on...
Who told you to speak for me!
lt's hard enough to stand the pain...
Why do l have to answer her!
You don't understand.
Take that!
Tadahh!
What's this?
Mom, how come the Kimbap
looks so funny?
Ugly ones always taste better!
- l want a normal lunchbox!
- Just eat this!
There's no hope for cookies...
When you get better,
promise we'll go fishing,
visit the mountains,
and go swimming! Okay? Hey!
l went to Busan.
l was there for ten nights!
Ten nights? You're lying!
l went swimming everyday
at my grandmas!
lt hurts,
you're scrathing my skin.
Sebastian's been to Disneyland.
How about you, Hani?
Oh my God!
Hey, Sebastian!
Do you write your diary in English?
You're in Korea!
Korea!
My name's PARK JoonTae!
Don't' call me Sebastian.
And mind your own business!
That's cool.
Can't you be cool?
What...
cool?
What're you looking at!
Want a taste of my fist?
When you get well, you'll
be able to walk better, right?
Yeah, but my arms and legs
won't get better.
- How about your eyes?
- Even eyes!
- That's not getting better!
- l don't know. And stop pushing me!
Mom...
Lower the volume,
my ears are gonna burst!
Right.
lt's time for your medicine.
Stop making so much noise!
My entire body's aching!
Hani! Do you know how strong
your brother's medicine is!
You're driving me nuts!
You're big fat whiners!
l hate you both!
Hani, open the door! Hani!
You know your brother's sick!
Open the door, Hani!
- Shouldn't we give him Zofran?
- Hold on!
His fever's not dropping.
We should take him to ER.
Okay. l'll get the car.
By attacking it so much...
Hani.
Dad...Dad...Dad...
Have you been here alone all night?
Were you scared?
What?
Don't cry...
That's my fault...
l used... the fish towel!
Bad germs...
got to HanByul...
Don't worry.
lt's OK
Hi, Wook!
All this noise tells me that
Wook is here!
l'm not Wook!
My name's Little boy Jade!
Little boy Jade!
l never thought he would
get worse so soon...
l'm so proud of Wook. For 3yrs,
He's put up a strong fight.
lt's an incredible.
We never had a child who has
smiled through such pain as he.
This is my place.
Want some rice cakes?
You're new here!
JANG HanByul, 12 yrs old?
You look smaller than me.
What's wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong! Get out!
- l'm not inside?
What a country boy...
Who looks girly and stinks...
l don't want rice cakes!
lt stinks!
JANG Hani!
Take those clothes off!
- Are you HanByul?
- Yeah, JANG HanByul!
- What's your name?
- My name is Choi Wook.
You two look like brothers.
Wook, you now have an
older brother.
You must be tired.
Let's get you in bed.
- Excuse me.
- Uh, yes.
Wook!
- Dad!
- Wook!
lt's time for
'How in the world could this happen'.
You're the best, Dad!
Whoever wants to watch TV,
gather around!
l'm not tired.
l want to watch TV with Wook.
Come over, come over here.
l've never ever seen
anything like that!
lt's not only once in a blue moon.
He's sucking the milk any time.
HanByul, have you seen the
Tarzan man who was on before?
Yeah.
Hani loves that guy.
You mean the one who
swingsfrom place to place?
He lives in the mountains
behind our place.
You liar!
l'm not kidding...
You call everyone a big fat liar
cause you're one yourself!
Look at this!
lt's an autograph of Little Boy Jade.
- Wow, how cool!
- Yeah.
You must be kidding?
An autograph should be authentic!
l'll get a real one!
When l get better,
l'm gonna go to his gag concert.
My dream is becoming a comedian.
Like Little Boy Jade!
You're not funny!
You're scary!
Hey, Wook! Look at Hani.
How he rides those wheels!
Pretty good!
Hani, let me ride them for once.
Hey! JANG Hani.
Just once.
Just this once. Please, Hani!
Hani!
Let Wook ride them once.
You can't, country boy...
Country boy, country boy...
Didn't l tell you not to call
Wook a country boy!
But he is one!
Raise your right foot!
Shut up!
You shut up!
Put your left foot down!
- l told you to shut up!
- No, you shut up!
Please wait outside.
Mom, my shit's too big!
Who said you shouldn't cry
in front of your sick child?
Day after day, l have to cry
in this stinking place.
Try submerging your face
in the water.
That way, your face won't get
swollen and eyes go bloodshot.
Just try it!
Mom, my shit's sitting up
like a snake!
Come quick, it's really big!
You think she has nothing better
to do than stare at your shit?
You're shit's stinking up
the entire hospital.
Who's that? Mom?
Who is she?
Wook, you'll fall.
- Are you okay?
- Yes
Hani, you're here!?
l gave him my old one.
- How come? He can't even ride them!
- Stop thinking l can't.
Are you kidding me!
You can't even walk in them!
Why do you have this?!
You gave it to me.
lt's mine now.
Give it back to Wook!
Hair grows on your asshole if
you take back what you gave.
lt's mine! Give it back!
Give it to me!
Give it back! Awe shit!
That was really mean of you.
Wook!
Wook!
Wook hasn't told anyone! Stop
being scary, and go apologize to him!
l'm not scared!
You apologize!
Hani, you did a mean thing.
Wook is sicker than l am!
You're not supposed to hit him!
All your fault!
l gave you the King of Fun card,
cause you're sick.
lt was my present to you.
Why did you give it to
someone else? Why!
Hey! stop him, JoonTae.
Shit!
Hey, stop him!
Hey! stop him, JoonTae.
Shit!
- Hey, stop it!
- You wanna die!
Stop!
Stop! Stop!
- Let go.
- JANG Hani, stop!
Stop!
Hani, you are dead!
He will tell on his Mom.
Why can't you tell me who did this?
Are you being threatened?
l hurt myself playing soccer,
so just go!
Then why are you refusing to
go to school!
l am going to find out
who did this to you!
You look real cool.
You must feel great going home, Wook.
What's with the long face!
Don't cry.
lt'll just drain you.
Wook!
l like staying here
with you better.
l'm bored all day
when l'm home.
l'll go see you when
l'm out of the hospital!
Really?
When will you be out?
When l'm finished
with my radiation therapy.
Mom!
You'll let me visit Wook. Right?
Really?
Promise me, okay?
l got a new bicycle.
When you come visit, l'll let you ride it.
l heard the news from
HanByul's teacher today.
Yeah...
l would have paid more attention
to Hani if l had known earlier.
Um... Hani...
didn't come to school today.
He hasn't been getting along
with a classmate.
Two days ago, he got hurt
during a fight with Hani.
The injured boy's mother made
a complaint to the principal.
l'm sure you have
enough on your mind,
but please talk to Hani.
Hey, Little Boy Jade!
HanByul!
For my medicine, l have to wait.
lt's my home phone number!
l have a problem!
- Why?
- JANG Hani...Where are you now?
- JANG Hani!
- Wow!
Dummies!
This is mouth wash.
Gargle and spit...
- Just go to Wook's place.
- l won't!
Not country boy's place!
Suit yourself.
Summer vacation starts, you've got
plenty of time to get punished!
Mom's in a horrible mood these days.
You're dead!
Yeah, she's real scary when she's mad!
What're you gonna do?
Bye, Wook!
Bye, HanByul!
Bye, HanByul!
Bye!
Bye, HanByul!
Bye
- should pick some ginko nuts
- ls it time to?
For sure
We can pick
some tomorrow with kids.
Eat well, good boy!
Our opponent, JANG Hani is
about to make his kimchi shoot!
He's pacing the goal post like
a man taking a shit
but letting out empty
farts instead!
This time it's really a goal!
That's against the rules!
No smacking the head with a spoon!
The spoon's for
spooning up rice!
You're absolutely right!
Hey, Wook!
This?
l have them all over me.
Some here.
And here...
You wanna go see
Tarzan man?
Dummy,
you don't even know the way!
Uh, lt's a sunny-side-up
fried egg flower!
Fried egg?
HanByul and l call it
cause it looks like a fried egg!
Look!
This is the yolk.
And this is the egg white.
lt's my favorite,
Erigeron Annuus.
And you call it what?
Fried egg?
Then eat it!
Erigeron Annuus?
That sounds funnier.
l'll call it erigeron ANAL!
- Hey...
- What?
Hey, JANG Hani! Hani!
Hani...
Wook!
Wook! Wook!
Wook!
l hope they didn't go up
the mountain in the back!
lt may look harmless,
but you can get lost there.
You're here!
No news yet?
lt looks like they
went up the mountain.
What?
Wook! Hey!
Hey, CHOl Wook!
Hey, Wook!
Wake up!
Wook...
Wook!
JANG Hani!
Where are you Wook?
- Wook!
- CHOl Wook!
Don't come near!
Go! Go away!
Don't touch him! Gp away!
Don't touch him!
Wook! Wook!
Wook! Are you OK?
l'm not Wook.
My name's Little Boy Jade.
Wook!
Hani!
- Mom! Dad!
- Dad!
- Wook! Wook...
- Hani...
- Wook!
- Hani!
Wook!
- Hani, get your butt over here!
- Mom!
Wook!
Did you go up the mountain?
Yes!
- You really went up there?
- Yes.
My Wook's all better now!
l'm telling the truth!
He really was dead!
Be quiet. lf that water
can raise the dead,
there wouldn't be a single dead
person in the world!
Cause no one knows
about it!
He really woke up
after drinking it!
l'm sure he just fainted!
But, you could've got
him killed!
That water would sell well
at this hospital, wouldn't it?
Go to sleep!
Ouch! ln real life,
Tarzan man's so dirty.
Hey, monkey, come down!
You already broke one of
my jump ropes yesterday!
Why can't he do it with his own!
l don't get him!
l know.
What, Wook's back?
Okay. l'm coming, bye!
Hey, your backpack!
Don't wake him.
Let's come back later.
Let's just wait here, huh?
We don't know
when he'll wake up.
We'll just ask them to call us
when he does.
Let's go.
lt's too dangerous to continue
chemotherapy on him.
He'll probably
never come out of his sleep.
For the past 3 yrs l've worked so
hard to pay the hospital bills,
that l've never enjoyed
a single day with him.
He's put up a good fight for
the past 3 months.
l can't give up the treatment now.
But you know
it'll be ineffective.
His body cannot endure
the medication anymore.
Be prepared for the worst.
You're here to see Wook?
Welcome. l'll take care of you.
Have a good time!
l'll fix you up with cool dudes!
Hey boy! Who are you with?
Go home!
Glad to see you girls!
You always give us a good deal!
l'm the best...
- Little Boy Jade...
- l've got to score my first customer!
- What do you want? Hey!
- Little Boy Jade!
You're pissing me off!
Girls, wait a second!
Wait a minute!
Hey
Go home! Little jerk!
Please l beg you...
l need to meet
Little Boy Jade, please!
You really want to meet
Little Boy Jade?
A lot?
Then go over to that parking lot
in the back.
Go there.
My friend Wook,
he's really sick.
He wants to be a
comedian like you.
He wants to become a comedian.
He really wants to meet you.
He will get better
after meeting you.
l have a friend called Wook...
Little Boy Jade will be
here tonight!
- You're here.
- Yeah.
Hani, l'll take you home today.
You got wet in the rain yesterday.
You look like you have the flu.
You could give it to your brother.
No!
- Then, do you want to go with Daddy?
- l'm not going!
- Why? Why not?
- l don't know...
What's the matter?
- Have you checked everything?
- Yes.
He's...awake! He's awake!
He's awake!
Please be quite...
- You're Little Boy Jade!
- Hey! Quiet...
Little Boy Jade!
Mom! Mom!
No one as ugly as you deserves
to be so arrogant!
You should at least be as
good looking as l am...
My name is Little Boy Jade!
Wow! Hi, my name's Yooki.
Please call me Yooki O-Cheon!
l now appoint you, 'comedian.'
Thanks, 'shitty pants!'
Now, let's have fun!
My name is Little Boy Jade!
- lsn't it cool?
- So cool!
- Awesome, isn't it?
- Wow! ls it really Little Boy Jade?
Did you get his autograph?
- Terrific! Did you really see him?
- Of course l did.
- Where's JoonTae?
- l don't know.
He is Wook.
There's no cure for cancer.
Only medicine that makes your
hair fall out like HanByul's.
My brother doesn't have cancer!
He has a brain tumor!
Since his first operation, you can
see a noticeable change in size.
Such rapid growth like
this rarely occurs.
lt looks like the tumor has
become quite malignant.
Although
we may have to
give up his optic nerves,
we need to remove the entire
tumor to prevent a relapse.
Hani.
HanByul's getting another
operation tomorrow!.
Let's wave our hands for him!
So he'll be strong!
But he's already had one!
Why another?
ls a brain tumor also cancer?
ls he gonna die?
Hani. Your brother's not gonna die!
He'll be okay.
HanByul wants to see Hani.
Hi.
Hi.
l told them
l only wanted to see Hani.
l hate to see you cry, Mom.
l'm not crying!
You're going to be better after
the operation tomorrow.
l'm really not crying.
l need to have a secret talk
with Hani!
Hani!
Sneak up behind mom
and make
her laugh by
surprising her, okay?
HanByul...
does it really hurt?
l don't know.
And...
you have the punishment
check book.
l don't need it anymore.
Take it.
Because...
you're...
a good boy now...
and...
- l don't want to go inside.
- Yes, you'll be okay.
- l don't want to! Mom, l don't hurt.
- HanByul!
- l don't want to go inside!
- You'll be okay!
- Mom, l already had an operation!
- Honey, go away. l will do!
- HanByul, HanByul!
- l don't need another operation!
Mom,
l'm not sick anymore.
- l don't need another!
- Honey.
- Mom.
- HanByul, l'll go with you.
- HanByul, l'll go with you.
- No!
Mom, l already had an operation!
Why do l need another one?
- lt's okay! HanByul!
- Mom.
Mommy will be here.
- Mom!
- HanByul, don't cry.
- Hanbyul, it's okay!
- Mom...
Hani!
HanByul.
l don't need it!
- Dad!
- Huh?
When does the operation end?
2 o'clock.
You're late, go!
Okay. Bye Dad!
JANG Hani!
- Why were you absent yesterday?
- My dog was sick. Real sick!
- Did it die?
- No, it had pneumonia!
lt almost died,
but now it's okay...
Okay, see ya!
JANG Hani!
How's your brother?
Please retrieve your cash.
Have a nice day.
Hurry up!
We have to be back by two!
l know!
Here...
lt should be here...
the trees
and the rocks are the same...
JoonTae,
l'm positive it's here!
Tarzan man...
was...living here.
Hey!
Where are you going?
- Mr. Tarzan!
- Hey!
- Mr. Tarzan...
- JANG Hani!
- Mr. Tarzan! Mr. Tarzan!
- JANG Hani!
Mr. Tarzan!
Mr. Tarzan!
Mr. Tarzan!
Mr. Tarzan!
Heavy bleeding and
the difficult nature
of the surgery required
2 more hours.
Fortunately,
we removed the entire tumor,
but...we'll need to observe
his brain function recovery.
We have to watch him until
his conscious is back.
There's no pupillary reaction.
Take a look at him.
JAMG Hani!
Mr. Tarzan!
Hani, l found it!
Pupillary reaction...
Negative.
HanByul!
- What're you doing here!
- My brother's in there!
