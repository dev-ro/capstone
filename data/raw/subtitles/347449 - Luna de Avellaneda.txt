AVELLANEDA'S MOON
What do sissies,
woosies and pansies know?
What do they know about tango,
about rhythm?
This is elegance.
What a look! What a figure!
What a stand! What an arrogance!
This is how tango is danced,
while I draw the eight...
For these arabesques,
I'm like a painter.
Now a run, a turn, a sitting...
This is how tango is danced,
a real hardcore one!
This is how tango is danced,
feeling in one's face...
blood rising with each bar...
while one's arm, as a snake,
coils up around the waist
that's going to break.
This is how tango is danced,
mixing breaths,
closing one's eyes to hear better...
how violins tell the bellows...
why since that night
Malena sang no more...
Look at the birdie!
Look!
" SOAPY POLE"
Up! Up! Come on,
honey, you can do it.
Nicolás! Come, please!
Well, well, well...
Thank you very much, dear friends...
And give a louder applause
to our dearest friend...
Alberto Castillo, Tango's doctor.
Well, well, well...A great applause.
Great as Luna de Avellaneda,
our beloved institution!
Let the dance go on!
Please stop the music, guys.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a little problem,
Luisita Maldonado is about to give birth.
Is there a doctor in the club, please?
Excuse me, excuse me.
Make way!
A great applause for the tango doctor!
What a night, dear friends!
What a night!
A night that could only
take place in our beloved club!
Let's welcome our
new member, our dear...
Román! What was that?
Román Alberto, and wish him
a life-full of full moons.
Music!
One moment... One moment,
One moment, please.
Ladies and gentlemen,
our beloved president, founder,
almost compatriot,
Don Aquiles Vizcaíno Puertas says...
Luna is honored to hand
the 1° life membership card...
to our beloved Romancito!
Since that remote night
in which three Galician boys...
freshly arrived from Spain decided...
A great applause for
Don Aquiles, for Doctor Castillo,
for our beloved club,
for great little Román,
and for the mother who bore him! Music!
Let the dance go on...
the dance of my homeland;
See the black folk dance...
to the beat of the tambourine
Let the dance go on...
the dance of my homeland;
Román, Román!
-Román, Román!
- Don't run!
I told you not to run.
Are you all right?
Don't put the showers in the court.
When will you fix it?
When you pay your dues.
One of these days
a kid will slip and then...
Okay, what's up?
You should go to dance class...
Something happened to a girl...
Stay here and clean up the puddles.
- Will you talk about me tonight?
- When you pay your dues.
I come every minute I have. If I pay
the dues, how do I feed my daughter?
You can't afford her food
and have your arm tattooed?
Cut a leg from that dragon
and see if she eats it.
We can't have all old men
in the board of this club!
I want to get involved!
You want to get involved?
Pay your dues.
Hi, daddy.
Hi, Maca.
- Is the cough gone?
- Yes.
- What happened?
- Nothing, I don't know.
We were stretching.
Don't look. We did this...
She went on and fainted.
This girl isn't a member of the club.
- I know. Don't look.
- Why?
- Maybe she's a bit...
- What?
- a bit...!
- Did she bite you?
No. I think she's hungry.
But, Cristina...
We don't run a charity here...
She's a friend of your daughter's.
She brought her.
She lives across the river;
came everyday, watched...
with such a face... I put her
in leotards and there she is.
Hello, honey.
- What's your name?
- Dalma.
Emilio...
We have company.
You like veal cutlet?
Make her a cutlet... Wait, wait...
How about some candy?
I prefer veal cutlet.
Don't count your riches
in front of the poor.
- A veal cutlet with fries and eggs!
- I like cutlet too.
When I was your age, I loved them...
My mom made me a platter like this...
Look, this is a club...
Members who come here pay a due,
understand?
I'd love to have you here, but...
but we can't.
I like it when you bring
friends to the club...
But it's unfair
to the other members...
because...
What? Don't look at me that way...
I'm not a...
I work for free here...
I spend twelve,
fourteen hours driving my cab...
whenever I'm free I work here.
We get nothing for free.
No, no. Don't look at me that way.
Punch it up with globalization,
sustainable growth... Kids love it...
Stop it, Nandito!
The turd didn't call, did he?
Eat your cutlet. I'll be right back.
- How can we stop this?
- I don't know. We should find out.
What are you doing?
Painting the players with our colors.
We're in the crapper
and you're painting toys?
It's a detail, man.
- God is in the details.
- What good it did to him.
Hello, Miss,
I need to talk to my lawyer.
Hello, Miss,
I need to talk to my lawyer.
Graciela Fernández...
Yes, Fernández, I'm still Fernández,
- until my lawyer does something about it...
- Hey, Graciela...
What lawyer?
My lawyer, your boss.
Who says he doesn't know me?
Tell him...
to answer the phone,
don't be a turd like my ex.
- Give it to me.
- Stop.
- I didn't insult you, miss.
- Calm down.
I didn't call you a turd!
Not your boss either. My ex-husband!
- I didn't insult you, you fucking moron!
- Give it to me.
- What for?
- You're crazy.
I'm not crazy!
- What are you, the brotherhood of the
turd?
Tell her the dentist doesn't
want to see Bruno.
Tell her to tell her boss to tell the turd
the dentist won't see his son anymore.
What number did you dial?
Oh, come on!
She's playing stupid!
Mr. Pellegrini, Miss!
What?
I'm sorry, sweetheart...
No, honey, it's the situation...
Iots of shit...
Wrong number. You see?
I always told you, I think
privatizations were fraudulent.
But, what now?
Bruno's braces have to be
taken out; the dentist won't do it.
- And the insurance?
- What insurance?
In the last 6 months, he didn't call,
show up, see Bruno, or send any money..
You mean the unpaid insurance!
Watch it, sweet!
Put this ad where it can be seen.
What are you doing, Amadeo?
Painting the players with our colors.
What a saint. He spends
all day fucking around.
So obvious you have no one to hurt, huh?
Not like my ex; he doesn't care
if his son is a dental retard.
But he paid for that
little slut's new breasts,
can you believe it?
I wish Bruno bursts them
with his deformed teeth.
- You will give French lessons?
- Oui, pourquoi?
It's great. The poet said: "Don't grant
defeat even when defeated".
- I'm not defeated, what are you saying?
- Nothing. The poet did.
Hi, Don Aquiles!
Gracielita, how are you?
I come from the electricity company.
Did you go on your own?
They admitted there was
a mistake in the invoice.
What a man!
Don't you want to remarry?
Guys, there's a trip downtown.
Who's taking it?
My phone bill's due.
Ok, go. I'm busy with this.
- Maca, do you want to come along?
- No, I'm staying here with Dalma.
I'll come for you later, ok?
Amadeo... How are you?
- I need to ask you for a favor.
- Whatever, bro.
He can't make you work
a double shift on training days.
What do you want me to do?
It's my job.
Let me talk to the guy.
No, you won't.
You're our key player,
we're near the finals.
What should I do? Quit my job?
Hello, stand up, class.
- Hello.
- Good evening, Miss.
- You Ok? You've got fever?
- No, it's a dry cough
- Did you give her the...?
- No, there's nothing left, but it'll get better.
Mom will take you to
the doctor tomorrow, yes, love?
- Dad, you said...
- Mom will take you tomorrow.
Is it necessary to call
a doctor just for a cough?
I'll ask my cousin to see her.
Fine.
- Can you help me?
- Yes.
Don't tell him we're behind in the
insurance. He'll tell your mom...
You know, I feel a little...
naked.
- Well...
- Well what?
Won't you look at my breasts
like when we were dating?
How was your day?
So-so, but they say tomorrow
it'll rain. So maybe...
How was yours?
- Will you be back late from the meeting?
- I don't know, why?
- So that we can talk.
- Ok, if I come back early..
Did you hear Cárdenas died?
- Who? The one from the store?
- No, from the parking lot.
- Didn't his wife die last week?
- No, that was Ercilia, from School 27.
Nobody was born?
I mean, for balance...
About the collector:
Resias' nephew was here.
- The guy from the blacksmith's?
- No, the blacksmith's is that way.
There's a little problem with him...
He's one-armed.
- But he looks honest.
- Yes.
- He'll be great as a collector.
- Honest and one-armed. Perfect.
Gas, 240. Insurance, 310.
And they killed us
with the electricity, 720.
I insist, turn off the court
lights at half-time.
Yeah, but who listens?
I officially want to introduce
our new dancing teacher, Cristina.
- Hi... I was just here...
- Welcome.
- Welcome. Very, very, welcome.
- Thank you very much.
Did your giris pay?
Yes, the giris are all paid for.
- Good. Very good, very good.
- Yes.
Ismael asked me to talk to you
about putting him on the board.
I think another youth wouldn't hurt,
besides me, I mean.
Ismael hasn't paid
his dues for six months.
But every free minute he's got he's
working
Like I say, the essential is invisible.
- To the eye.
- What else?
I love lsmael dearly, but the
board has to set an example.
The boy has proven
his commitment to the club.
- He looks optimistic.
- He has projects for the next 2 or 3 years.
Sometimes too optimistic.
You'll see, when you get to know this,
you'll fall in love.
This City lncome Bureau, in compliance
with guidelines for the semester blah,
having verified that Luna de
Avellaneda Social and Sporting Club...
has not filed the balance sheets...
for '88, '89, '90, '91,
92 well... 2003,
is liable for.. Stop it!
The sanctions provided for by,
well, the main thing, hence...
Stop it!
Hence it must pay
the amount of 40,000 pesos,
as fine for non...
I don't get... Stop it!
I don't get it, aren't we exempt?
It's 'cause we didn't loan
the club for their rally.
- Throw it away.
- No, no. It's not a tax thing,
it's a fine for not filing
the balance sheets these last years.
No! Pinball my ass!
The City could have made a mistake.
What'll they take?
The leaks? Throw it away
No, if they sent it, we have to face it.
We should talk to Alejandro,
the help of a city council...
Is he Secretary of Gov...
What does he do in the City Hall?
I don't know, he's in there.
I know Alejandro from way back.
It's a waste of time.
Leave it to me. I know him
from way back, too.
I'll go see him tomorrow. If he doesn't
listen I'll beat him up.
Leave it to me!
It's okay, cool down. I'll go.
Give me that.
Román, stay calm, you know how he is.
Here he comes.
I'll call you back.
How nice to see you.
Young as ever, huh?
Sorry I'm late; we're having
a crazy day. Romancito,
Vero, Maca, Dari?
- Who?
- Good.
Good, good.
This is no tax, Don Aquiles,
the City notifies you of a fine...
for failure to file balance
sheets for fifteen years.
What balance sheets?
$1000 come in and $1200 go out.
What you just said, that's a balance.
How are we going to pay $40,000!
- if we can't afford the...
- roofing.
The roofing that costs $58.
Oh, well...oh, well...
What do you mean?
They'll foreclose the club?
A debt is a debt, sooner or later
it has to be paid. It's no joke.
And you say it like that,
so calmly?
This is what you've become?
Don't be ridiculous.
You're being ridiculous! Always the same!
Let's negotiate, be flexible,
change things from the inside.
What have you changed? Tell me.
You were always like this
Do you think you're
the only one with social concerns?
Do you think you're the only one
who suffers? I care too.
Look,
my membership card.
I still have it. Do you have yours?
Don't have it, lost, stolen. Who cares?
I care! It's a treasure to me;
do you have yours? I do.
To me the Club is a symbol
of another time,
- but it's a symbol!
- It's not a symbol!
It's today's reality!
392 kids go every day
for their activities.
I care about the kids too,
that's why I'm here.
I know kids are our only hope.
- Screw you.
- That's why I'm here!
You're always the same.
- Let's not argue.
- We're not arguing, Don Aquiles.
This has to be a mistake,
see if you can give us a hand,
and please,
Iet's cut out the
"kids are the only hope" thing...
We're grown-ups.
It doesn't look good.
It doesn't look good.
Excuse me.
Have you seen Ms. Battaglia?
At the bar on the corner.
- Honey.
- Hello.
Hello.
I brought you the...
the cough syrup.
- Yeah, give it to me.
- You're heading home after?
Yes. Right now...
I'm heading there, yes.
Do you want to sit?
- No, no. I'll be late. I was...
- Really, stay.
- No.
- Come on.
No.
- Throw!
- That's it. Go, go, go.
Very good, Darío! Good, kid, good.
Come on, that's it, good, good.
Foul, man, foul!
- Didn't you see that?
- Foul for the offense.
The offense?!
What are you looking at?!
Enough. Game over!
What are you doing?
No women, we're about
to be champions.
What do you mean no women?
Leave me, Crist
- Hold on.
- Cristina!
Then we have to put up with you!
What is this? Let me go!
Cristina!
Cristina!
How are you, honey pie?
What a surprise!
- What were you doing?
- A game strategy.
Listen, I wanted to talk to you.
- You busy now?
- I was just going home.
Do you like ethnic food?
I know a great Scottish restaurant.
There's a National Dance Contest
I called to see how it is;
they sent me the paperwork.
I think it's great
for your group, huh?
You shouldn't drink here.
It's cool.
- Do you want some?
- No, no.
- You don't drink?
- No...yes.
Sometimes I do, but you can't here.
So? I'll help with the paperwork.
Yes, no; I don't think
the giris are ready yet to...
You said a National Contest?
I think they're not ready yet.
What if we don't win?
We lose, big deal.
The problem is if we win,
'cause then we go international.
Yes.
What? There's an
international contest?
I don't know. We should find out.
If we don't win, they have
a good time, get to know places.
I've seen you dance, and if the giris
have the same effect on the jury,
we'll win the Nobel Prize.
Where did you see me?
I close the door to the classroom,
you couldn't have seen me;
I close the door.
Yes, I saw you.
'Cause...
I was changing the clasp on the door...
The clasp, yeah, the bolt.
It was broken but I fixed it.
- You fixed it?
- Yes.
There was a little hole in the glass...
Like this...
And I put my eye to it and...
saw you dance...
and I was struck, you know...
by how you move your hand.
Sure, but because it's a position that...
There!
Yes, like that.
Like that.
Yeah.
How could we not win?
Have you been single
for a long time?
Just asking.
I never see you on the phone,
you don't get calls,
I ask you and we go out.
You're single.
No.
Yes, it's been 3 months;
I'm great on my own.
Why do you put your
hand on your belly?
I don't know.
I just put my hand on my belly.
Don't know why.
Women do that when pregnant
or thinking of getting pregnant.
No, not at all, really.
How come you're great on your own?
Were you in trouble? Were you pregnant?
Hold it; you're way out of line;
Who are you, Sherlock Holmes?
Why, why?
It's my business...
- You were never screwed over by a
woman?
Mónica.
- I don't know, I don't care...
- She was totally bonkers.
It's okay, I'm not asking...
- And Silvia, too.
- It's your business.
- What are you laughing at?
- I was rememberingAdriana.
Another one.
That bitch fucked me big time!
See?
and after suffering so much...
Can't you say:
I'm doing great on my own?
Don't you feel great on your own?
No.
I'm sorry, I was joking.
There it comes.
Want to come over to my place?
Bye.
- Oh, you scared me.
- I'm sorry.
It's midnight. Where were you?
I worked late.
My stomach is upset.
- Don't you feel well?
- No
Here, take an anti-acid.
Please, Román, we need to talk.
Daddy!
Yes, love, yes, I'm coming.
Go to sleep.
I don't know what happened.
Maybe I'm fragile right now.
We were not doing well.
- It wasn't that bad...
- We weren't doing well, come on!
Now we're doing worse.
You don't pay attention to me.
How long have I wanted to talk?
You should've told me
it was something like this...
How? "Honey, give me a minute
to tell you about my lover"?
Stop, the kids will hear you, please.
I didn't want you to find out this way.
I don't really know what I wanted.
Maybe it was a temporary thing.
And what...
Is it serious?
I don't know, I'm not sure.
What would "serious" be?
If you slept together,
it'd make the thing a tad serious.
What's the difference?
The guy fell in love with me,
he says he loves me, not that he cares;
I believe him.
We quiver when we say it!
Right... quiver.
- Yes, people can quiver!
- You must be nervous.
Let's see, how do you quiver?
- We quiver!
- Show me how you quiver.
- I see...
- See what you make me do!
He quivers.
And waits eagerly
for me and wears perfume.
- Oh, perfume's important.
- It's very important.
I see,
going to bed isn't important.
Wearing perfume is.
- Can you listen to me?
- I'm listening.
You see, I'm listening.
When are you going to fix it?
It leaks into the garage.
The window guy's coming to the club,
I'll ask him for a quote.
- Kiss me.
- What?
Yeah, not one of those
morning goodbye kisses,
- a wet one.
- What are you, nuts?
First the skylight,
now the kissing, what...
Come on.
We'll do something
about this, yes?
Let's find things about each other,
like we used to...
- Yes.
- Ok.
I know it's difficult...
20 years with the same person.
If only it were always
the same person...
Poor girl!
Yeah.
What a shitty life!
Who?
Máxima, the Dutch Queen; suffered from
stress and bumps forward her vacation.
Oh, boy! You scared me!
Let's see...
They say she's from
the neighborhood.
Yeah, flower shop?
I'd like to place an order.
What flowers can I get for...
five pesos?
Are those fast-growth seeds?
- Hello.
- Hello.
Look, I haven't bought
perfume in a long time;
I wonder if the one I used to wear,
by Calvin Klein, is still available.
Yes, sir.
We have several fragrances.
What's the price range?
They start at 67 pesos.
And those going up to 67,
where do they start?
We have some national
fragrances which are very good,
There's Skittish, which is selling
very well... 32 pesos.
It's a bit much for me.
Well,
- Walk with me to the annex, please.
- Sure
I have a really
good line of imitations.
We have Fashion Fantasy,
which is Calvin Klein-like.
- The same as Calvin Klein?
- Like.
Taiwanese.
It's quite "smellable". Only 22 pesos.
Gee! It's a bit much.
There's a line of craft fragrances
made in the country.
Great, so we pitch
in while we're at it.
You've got Mar del Plata, Ocean Splash.
- What does Mar del Plata smell like?
- It's sea-like, fresh.
- No, I want something else.
- Spice Tangerine, Rosemary Trunk,
Aniseed Cardamom; a new age scent.
- More contemporary.
- That one.
I'll try Aniseed Cardamom.
Great choice.
These products have no
marketing or packaging costs,
no fancy wrapping,
so they cost only a few pesos,
and you get a bonus bar of soap.
Román,
please, you have to help me.
Hold on, let me hook this wire,
because if I cut it here...
That, there...
it's nothing, calm down.
Open your mouth and shut up.
- What? You hurt him?
- No, no.
Shut up! Go tell your dad...
who left you like a used condom.
What's with you? That's what women
are like when they split up?
It's the truth! It smells
like cat piss in here.
- Aw! Motherf...
- What happened?
I cut myself. This is barbed wire.
I wouldn't be surprised;
with that shitty HMO.
- Let's see.
- Look, you know what?
Enough with this relationship,
let him stick the ring up...
his ass.
Damn, it shrank!
- Hand me the pliers, Román.
- Hold on.
What are you doing in my workshop?
Animal! What are
you doing to the kid?
Don't push my hand?!
I was about to get that one.
Let me do it, hold on.
You stay cool, Bruningui, ok?
- There.
- Careful.
- Smells like fennel, doesn't it?
- I have to go.
- Hold on a little.
- Easy.
I have to change tools, ok?
Keep your mouth open,
you have a loose wire.
- That's it. We're done.
- What are you doing, asshole?
- It's a joke!
- I know!
Hand me the small pliers.
Look all the crap
I got from your mouth.
- Alejandro! How nice to see you!
- How are you?
Four to one, four to one...
That game was 20 years ago!
I forgot all about it.
Four to one, four to one!
- You took the ball away, asshole.
- Sore loser.
That kid is good.
That's Darío, Román's son.
And Verónica's.
Maybe one of these days
we'll win, right?
How can we pay 2,000 pesos a month?
It's a good deal.
Low interest rate,
in 2 years you're clear.
And we're back to
where we were 10 years ago.
October of '98.
We loaned the club for a party rally.
- They stole 72 chairs.
-76.
Think of them as payment.
Don Aquiles, tell them it's a good deal.
Guys, let's be reasonable.
How can they charge a 40.000 peso fine?
- They can.
- It's insane!
Hello.
Hello.
Absolutely unbelievable.
These guys say X amount
and it's X amount.
That happens everywhere.
Malvinas' vets got
their fields expropriated,
then the Mayor's front came
and set up indoor soccer courts.
- So?
- What do you mean "so"?
- I mean so what?
- "So what"?
- Anybody can speak here?
- Who you calling anyone?
He's not anyone. Ismael is on the board.
Get out.
Listen, Don Aquiles.
We're broke.
Where are we gonna get $2,000?
Let's shake things up.
Let's call the TV, put a hidden
camera up their asses...
and broadcast live all the crap they do.
Let's be serious.
This conversation is over,
let the board meet about this.
What? You're off the board,
for being a moron.
And you took the ball away.
You were losing 4 to 1!
- The game wasn't over.
- It was over for you.
Cut it out with that game!
Alejandro, please, help us.
We do what we can.
- Who's "we"?
- City Hall.
No, City Hall is us. You are you;
if you say "you" meaning "us",
you're going to say "we" meaning "you",
and you're on your side,
and we're on ours.
until you're done with us,
or we're done with you.
- Hey, you're the stinker!
- No! I'm wearing cologne!
Listen, man,
you can help us out.
So now I can help you?
How? Burying the file?
Pulling strings?
Under the table?
You've always done it; you're good at it.
Do you think apples
floated before Newton?
Shut the fuck up, you fucking drunk!
Román!
Well,
- How much for the tea?
- Nothing, it's ok.
Two pesos.
Amadeo!
Amadeo...
- Hello.
- Hello.
Thanks for the bracelet, it's gorgeous.
I made it with Bruno's braces.
- Really?
- Yes.
How amazing!
- Does the rowboat work?
- The clutch slips.
It's a rowboat, of course it works.
Oh, right.
I can imagine more romantic
things for a first date.
Why?
'Cause the landscape's ugly
and there are no great trees?
Well,
the fauna doesn't help, either, huh?
Do you know the matchbox girl story?
OK, stop rowing.
On New Year's Eve,
- a girl sells matches on the street.
- Here?
Wherever you want.
A girl sells matches on the street.
She's about to freeze
to death in the snow.
Then it's not here.
Last thing we need, snow.
And she tries to light
a match to warm up;
so she lights it and...
the flame is huge, like a...
a wood stove, warming her up,
her whole body.
She tries to warm up her feet,
but the match burns out;
she lights another one and a huge banquet
shows up: there's turkey, marzipan...
I haven't had marzipan in ages.
Cider, I don't know, all sorts of things.
So she lights another one, and another
one,
until the last one...
and her granny shows up.
I don't know why not her parents,
she must not have any; even sadder.
So she asks her granny to take her,
because she knows afterwards...
there will be nothing left...
no turkey, marzipan,
candy, warmth; nothing.
So the granny...
holds her tight
and...
takes her far from all of it...
from the cold,
the sadness,
and everything ugly.
The next day
some people walked past her
and found her dead
surrounded by matches,
A guy said: She must have
tried to keep warm...
And nobody thought that
she had found happiness,
that she was in heaven,
far from sadness with her granny
It's a story that l...
it moves me so much.
- What does it have to do with me?
- I don't know...
You also move me... A lot.
Because you keep lighting matches...
for everyone, to the giris in...
dance class, or Brunito, I don't know...
And...
I don't care what they say about you,
I think you're precious,
You're a precious guy.
What's that look on your face?
The truth?
It's just...
What?
- No, don't tell me.
- I'm in love with you.
Oh, no, no.
- What?
- Get it out of my head... I beg you.
- I can't, I swear.
- We're falling into the water.
I don't know what happens to me.
I asked the guys; they don't know, either.
What do the guys know?
I'm falling into the water.
Seriously, I mean it.
Row, row. I beg you. What a situation.
Go row, I'll go with you, come on.
We got to get it out of our heads...
But don't be mad, you look mad.
What?
- You won't talk to me anymore?
- No.
And don't tell me any more stories.
- Know what happened to that kid?
- What kid?
The Dane. She froze to death,
alone, starving, mad;
if you think you can help me
with stories, you're screwed!
You only make me fall harder for you,
see you like the sweetest,
most tender woman in the worid,
You blow me away If you don't
feel the same, don't do this.
Love isn't a match or a gag!
And you can't handle it.
- Yes, I can.
- You can't.
- I totally can.
- Show me.
No, no, no.
- Come on, handle the love.
- No, thanks, I've been hurt enough.
Me too, so what?
I've taken many nasty blows.
I always make the wrong choice...
and you can't be a moron yesterday,
today and tomorrow.
Yesterday, sure; today,
I don't know; tomorrow, no.
I'm trying to...
pull myself together.
With the lessons, the club...
I'm trying to make
ra-tío-nal decisions, period.
It's not about you or your hair.
- What about my hair?
- Nothing.
It's not your hair;
I love it, and you know it.
It's everything, the drinking;
I want a solid guy,
with a job even.
And you're here,
and the guy I want is over there!
I don't wanna get involved...
Pulling you out of who knows where...
I don't want to be a mother. Let's be
healthy.
So let's be adults.
- Give me back my bracelet!
- No.
- Give it to me!
- No, it's mine!
Shit!
- What happened?
- A prick.
- I pricked you?
- Yeah, no. Let go. Sorry!
Sorry my ass! Don't talk to me again;
shove the matches up your ass.
Anticyclones in the
South Atlantic and Pacific...
affect our territory...
In summer,
the South Atlantic anticyclone...
Who was that?
Enough! Silence! What's going on?
Can't you see this is a bore?
- Who cares about the Patagonian winds?
- They're very important.
What for?
For the economy.
For the economy? Give me a break!
If you'd rather be an ignorant,
don't waste your time learning;
I won't waste mine
teaching you. Get out.
Fine.
- Where are you going?
- You said "get out".
Don't get like that.
You think I can teach you nothing?
You think you know it all?
I can give you a day-by-day rundown
of the rest of your life. I got you down pat!
I know how you'll knock your girl up
'cause you're too cool for a condom.
Right?
How you'll end up with a crummy
job to support your family,
and then when they start
shoving you, you'll apologize.
Start using this; with that idiotic face,
it's all you have left.
You know nothing about me.
It'll be written up,
no big deal, it's nothing.
- No.
- Yes. Besides,
you were spending more
than you made.
Not even to make money.
Nothing, totally useless.
I took it out on kids
who are more lost than us.
- It's no big deal, Vero.
- Yes, it is.
Do you remember our dreams?
The best couple, best kids,
a different life...
And look,
not even as a mother.
Macarena doesn't
laugh if you're not around.
- Come on...
- No, no...
This bar smells like disinfectant!
Darío has no relationship
with either of us.
What are you saying?
I see him play every day.
That's all he is to you?
Does he have a girlfriend? Ambitions?
We know nothing about him.
He has to study, do something.
Or else, he'll be useless like us.
- Sebastian is right.
- Don't say his name!
Sebastian, the kid I slapped.
Oh...
I'm sorry.
You're the man of my life, you fool.
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.
Doesn't show.
Doesn't it?
At university meetings,
when you talked I couldn't breathe.
Really, from love, passión, admiration.
Come on, Román,
wouldn't you like to find someone
who makes you feel that?
We both deserve it.
Sleep, my love.
Sleep.
You smell nice, daddy.
Thank you, baby.
- What are you doing here?
- I'll give you a ride.
I'm just a hop away.
- I know, it's cool.
- No, no, it's two blocks away.
Come on, it's cool. I'll drop you off.
- 'Sup, dude? Everything cool?
- Yeah.
Cool.
What happened?
Nothing.
I don't know, yes.
It's nothing...
Your mom and I were talking...
We decided to split up for a while.
Don't tell Maca yet; it's not something...
What?
Why?
Well, it's hard...
It's been 20 years, you know.
So?
Well, maybe it's temporary,
it's not for sure.
What's important is your sister's
life and yours will be the same.
That's why I wanted to give you a ride...
We go on like every day.
- But you never drove me!
- Well, from now on,...
Like every day
Let me finish talking.
What for? You made up your mind.
- I want you to understand.
- We have nothing to discuss.
- Chacha, my dad...
- How are you?
Hello,
How are you doing?
I'll pick you up,
take you to the game and talk.
No, let's do like every day.
Darío, I have to talk to you.
Who's this guy here?
Oh, he's just a kid. Listen,
I won't need you any more.
Man,
- that booth's a sauna.
- And it's free.
You're kidding me.
You're over my budget. You cost me
a fortune and my numbers don't add up.
You're paying me 300 pesos!
So what? Yucatán works for half that.
- Jonathan.
- I've been working here for a year!
Look, if you take what this moron takes,
- I kick his ass out to the street...
- Hold it, stop it.
Wasn't I like your second son?
Answer me!
Please, understand, I can't make it!
I never missed a day!
Well, it's over.
- You can't be such a son of a bitch.
- Yes, he can.
Calm down.
- Fucking fatso!
- All right.
- Fucking fatso!
- Go, sissy! Crybaby.
Go with daddy!
- Who's a crybaby, you shit?
- You.
Who did you call crybaby?
- What are you doing? You crazy?
- Yes, I'm crazy.
- Call the cops.
- Come on, motherfucker.
Go call them.
Call the cops, chicken shit!
Every day's going to be like this?
My first time in jail.
At first it's nice,
then the magic's gone,
and then you get tired.
I'm already tired.
Anyway, I didn't work for nothing.
I got enough for the ticket,
- and a bit extra.
- What ticket?
Maldonado, father and son.
Like old times, huh.
How many do you owe me?
- Come on.
- Open up.
God! You're insane!
- You all right? -Yes, I'm all right.
- Me too.
- Excuse me, may l?
- Of course.
Come in!
- How are you?
- Fine, come in.
We are so rude...
Have a seat... Some coffee?
I'm taking a shower, I stink.
You look prettier every day.
Sure. Even on the phone
they call me "madam".
But you look so young.
Thank you, really.
- I didn't know who to call.
- Forget about it.
- I'll make coffee. Strong?
- Very light for me.
What was he saying?
Weren't you in the shower?
- Tell me.
- What?
It's not him, right?
- See how you are?
- Sorry.
You have to break the record.
- What record?
- Your old man's.
Got the cutest girl in town,
and I can't say,
"you should've seen her 20 years ago";
she's still the same cutie.
When are we meeting her?
- Who?
- Yanina, his girlfriend.
Girlfriend? You knew about this?
This is how I find out?
Mom! Yanina, big deal.
Hey, they worry about you,
I wish people worried about me.
Rest assured, you've got people worried.
- Next time, I'll leave you inside.
- Okay, enough chatter for me.
Chatter? Nobody chats here!
How can we know nothing?
And you two,
splitting up and saying nothing?
Who told you?
I did. Can we talk about that later?
Why later? Let's talk now.
This is not the time.
- I'm leaving. Bye.
- Bye, thank you.
This is not the time.
Everything at once.
- What do you mean?
- Darío leaving, you breaking up.
Leaving? Are you kidding me? Where?
Well...
I want to go to Spain.
Román!
- What are you doing?
- Did you know Darío's going to Spain?
I found out in the precinct.
Can't we talk later?
You're doing nothing?
What do you want?
I'm buck naked in the shower!
- I won't allow this!
- I've made up my mind.
- You said you were saving money.
- Dad, I told you!
About saving money,
not that it was decided.
What am I gonna do here?
Why don't you come work
at the City Hall with me?
So they don't keep going away...
Darío's going nowhere. He's happy here.
It's not a time to be apolitical.
- I do politics at the club.
- For 20 giris who want to dance.
For more than 300; you know that.
Come on, Román.
You should've seen
your dad 20 years ago.
The Soup Kitchen Assembly.
How many were there?
-300, 500?
- I don't know.
The auditorium was packed,
and he stood there speaking,
and they listened...
They listened.
The power to be heard,
that pull,
not anybody has it.
Remember, Vero?
Do you or don't you?
What happened?
Get out.
The things we'd do if we worked together.
Get out.
Dalma!
Dalma!
Gladys!
They're calling Dalma, from the club!
Dalma!
- Do you go to school?
- Yes.
Sure?
What's your school's name?
School.
I see, now I'm reassured.
Doing well, you and l.
-Babysitter's here.
-Man, what a bummer!
Come in, brother.
Make yourself at home.
Forget about the other day.
What?
Being thrown in jail,
splitting up, Darío being
fired or losing the club?
You've already forgotten.
- No I haven't, I'm sorry.
- You were right. Here.
Let's not drink now.
How about some ice cream?
All right. If you want to.
- Got cable?
- An illegal hook-up. It's great.
80 channels and a 100-year pardon.
Mr. Julio Quintana,
he must be expecting me...
Yes, one moment, please.
Come with me.
Bonjour, madame.
Je ne suis plus madame,
je suis mademoiselle.
I didn't get a word.
See why I need French lessons?
- How d'you do?
- Enchantée.
- Julio.
- Jules.
You're embarrassing me. It's unfair
I don't mean to.
Merci.
Thanks for coming here; at my
company they wouldn't leave us alone.
They drive me crazy!
I hope you don't mind.
No, on the contrary.
I know another word in French.
Champagne.
Let's see, this one.
Say it aloud.
This one?
Don't you want one further up?
- Dom Perignon.
- It sounds great!
- Won't it be too sweet?
- No, but a bit too dear.
...good wines, good food,
are an important part of the good life...
- Let me try that crap?
- Hey, you hated lemon!
Not anymore.
Must be age.
How did Maca take it?
I didn't tell her.
I told her I had to take care
of you 'cause you had the flu.
You moron. Why would you say that?
She adores me, she'll be worried.
Ok. I'll tell her mother
dumped me so she won't.
That's an idea...
Hey, hold on!
Gross! You licked the whole spoon!
- Lick my face, too.
- Oh! The lady!
Know what? Screw her.
In the end, all broads are alike,
you worry all the time; when they
want to split, they don't give a fuck.
When it's over, it's over,
"see ya", zero guilt.
With a certain pleasure, I'd say.
We were born to suffer.
This is bliss.
In 2 weeks, there are some
French businessmen coming
and I want to impress them.
It's a huge deal, you know.
You don't want the
salmon mousse with that?
- Saumon?
- Yes.
- Oui.
- Yes, of course.
Please, a salmon mousse for the lady.
What were you saying?
I'm thinking 3, 4 times a week... If you
could
I'm not sure if 2 weeks will do.
What if you come along?
Extra pay, of course.
I'd love to,
- but I don't know if I'm up to it.
- What do you mean?
You speak perfect French,
in my humble opinion.
Merci.
You're very nice.
Merci.
You're beautiful.
And you'll save my life.
Merci.
I had to confront him.
I told him:
if you're so in love
with that putaine, leave!
Good; what did he say?
He left. Hasn't sent me
a dime in 6 months.
- C'est fini, dude.
- You remind me of a tango lyric:
"l can tell just by your looks
that you haven't been well loved."
- Oui. When shall we start?
- Whenever you want.
Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.
- Demain.
- Let's hear it.
- Demain.
No, demain.
Will you buy me a flower?
- Excuse me.
- Where are you going?
- Don't.
- What?
- A little " romance"?
- No...
" romantisme".
I'll make a quick call
home to check on the kids.
- My phone's been cut off.
- How come?
They said something
about not paying, screw them.
- Call from your cell.
- No.
It only gets incoming calls.
Shit! Bought this from a fakir?
Oh, you want it soft?
- Let me set the right mood...
- You have the remote in the bathroom?
It's the only place where
I can't reach the player.
Turn that off! I beg you!
- It's soul, man! It blows you away!
- I'm already blown away!
Okay.
- You don't take your pants off?
- No.
Why?
I need the padding.
If not, I'll go to the club.
Scoot, papi.
A little more sheet.
Where are we gonna get 40 grand?
