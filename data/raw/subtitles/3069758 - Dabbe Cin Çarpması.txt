So doctor,
what was yourassesment at that time?
You mean back in 1986?
Yes. Why didn't you reveal
what happened in Kýbledere village.
I am a doctor not a politician.
Mr. Erhan, a doctor is responisble
fortelling the truth.
You can never guess
what happened in that village.
Those people were slaughtered...
And now you have to explain
why you didn't help them.
Don't be absurd. All the necessary reports
were prepared and even published in the papers.
This is from yourreport:
Post-traumatic stress disorder,
Mass schizophrenia,
anxiety, majordepression!
- Mr. Kubilay!!
Dissasociative disorders!
Genetic factors,
- Mr. Kubilay.
Psychological disorders...
- Mr. Kubilay!!!!
Yes.
What do you want?
What exactly happened to the people
in Kýbledere village?
Look...
You cannot learn this from me.
Then know that I will neverlet this go.
Mr. Erhan.
Hello.
Mr. Erhan.
A psychatrist friend of mine was
in this village a coupe of days ago.
Kýbledere village?
Yes. And she recorded stuff.
What is yourfriend's name?
Ebru.
Doctor Ebru...
...go to... university and find the footage.
That's all I can say.
Hello, Mr. Erhan.
Hello.
Mr. Erhan
This is Doctor Ebru karaduman.
This is the first day recording of a special case
with personality disorder.
I was called here by a guy
named Exorcist Faruk Hoca.
He is inside right now
He is currently working on a woman
He says herbody was taken
over by a 1300 year old jinn.
Faruk Akat has given me
permission to fýIm.
What is this kid doing here,
what are you doing here, get lost.
Get out, out, out, out.
Don't look son, come on sister sit here.
Go on.
Leave this woman at once!
Or I will send you...
to the deep corners of hell!
Stop talking!!
I am not afraid of you!!
Don't be scared of me,

Fear God!!
Fear God!!

Don't listen too him!
Go!! Leave!!
- Don't listen, hold tight
Nurhan.
Nurhan.
Didn't you put a curse on your neighbor
just because you were jaelous? Whore!!
Didn't you want herto die!

Cemile.
Cemile yourhusband will be
struck by a car...
They will fýnd his bowels
and brains underthe tires...

This guy can't do anything!!!
Or I will burn yourhouse down!!!!
Let go! Let go!
Let go!!!
Where is it?
There, it went there, check
Ebru stay back,
this could be dangerous.
Okay.
Let it out.
It's over
- Thanks.
Don't be afraid.
It's okay sister, it's okay
Sister, are you okay?
You're okay, right?
- I'm fine thank you
Wiýth the help of God...
Our patient is now cured.
Now listen carefully.
Don't do stupid stuff with charms
and amulets.
Don't engage in witchcraft.
Those who engage
in witchcraft will be cursed...
here and in the afterlife.
Okay, we are hearing a lot of
these cases these days.
One in every fýve person is taken
overby a jinn.
You can get in all sorts of trouble.
Accidents, curses, illness.
But if there's someone who knows
about these things...
The jinn can't do anything to you.
God has made us strongerthan them.
May God keep us away
from all that is evil.
Amen.
Amen.
Mr. Faruk has performed his show
but I still have things to ask him.
Hello.
- Welcome.
Hello.
How are you?
I'm fýne, you?
- Thanks, we are fýne.
This is a nice house you have here.
- Yes it is.
It is an old Greek house
from my grandfather.
Very nice.
Come in.
Thanks.
Thanks. All the embroidieries are handmade,
aren't they?
All of this is original,
we haven't touched anything.
Beautiful.
Hello.
- Hello, welcome
Sorry to bother you.
- Not at all, come in.
Thanks.
Ms. Ebru
Rest a little bit and then
you can start fýIming.
Welcome, again.
- Hello.
Mr. Faruk I'll set up the cameras now.
Of course, do whatever you want.
- Okay, thank you.
Mr. Faruk, what had happened
to that woman yesterday?
Now, out of nowhere,
she began to be scared of water.
She couldn't bathe or clean...
She was fýIthy and
began threatening everyone.
Didn't she see a doctor?
- The meds he prescribed made herworse.
Who said that?
- She, herfamily...
And they had heard of us so we helped.
- I understand.
Mr. Faruk,
what exactly did you do yesterday?
Have we started,
is this how it's going to go?
Yes, we've started...
You will tell me and show me
and I'm going to fýIm it.
Now look doctor.
- You can call me Ebru.
So Ebru, you will fýIm these and then what?
Wiill you show yourprofessors
at the school?
This is a test research,
we will choose a case
A person annoyed by a jinn?
You will call it a jinn,
I will call it something else.
Whatever. In the end, you will bring me
a patient the doctors couldn't cure.
And you will want me to cure him?
- Something like that.
Okay.
Let's say that I cured the worst patient
in a couple of days and you recorded that...
What will happen?
- What do you mean?
WiýII you accept?
- Accept what?
The existance of jinns.
- This will be a scientific research.
Forgive my ignorance doctor
but don't scientifýc tests yield results?
Of course, but only scientists
can evaluate these results.
Fine. So be it.
Now tell me about yesterday's event.
I have doubts.
You have doubts?
Didn't you see the state she was in?
I did.
So she came to us and we cured her.
She also went to a psychiatrist
and they gave her meds.
Did you have anything to do with that?
How so?
- Mr. Faruk, it was you who called me yesterday.
- That's correct.
Maybe you knew her
and you called her...
and you set the stage.
- Performed yourshow.
- Show?
No need to get angry,
we spoke about these earlier.
Okay, okay, fine.
Come with me.
I want to show you something. Come.
- Where?
- Just come with me.
- Hold on. I need to take the camera.
- Go ahead.
Do you have any idea what this is?
- It looks like the thing that came out
of her mouth yesterday. - Exactly.
So? Was she cured because...
...this thing came out of her mouth?
- She was cured because...
...the jinn that bothered her left with this.
I don't believe it.
You see it with your own eyes.
You are recording it.
And yet you still don't believe it.
Fine.
Before you pulled this out
of hermouth...
- why did you coverher?
- What does that have to do with anything?
You threw a cover overher.
You were underthere too.
This thing was in your pocket and
you put it in her mouth. Isn't that possible?
Only the ignorant accept everything,
scientists question.
Now answerme.
Why did you cover her?
In orderforthe jinn to leave the body
the place should be dark.
That's why I used the cover.
- You could have turned off the light of the camera.
- That would have worked too.
But you prefered to cover her.
Plus, it is medically impossible
for a thing this big...
...to just come out of a person's stomach.
Trust me, everyone who sees
this fýIm will think...
...that you turned some kind of trick
underthe cover.
So, no matterwho I cure...
...you and yourteachers will
always say the same thing.
You have a chance.
And what is that?
I will pick a patient, not you.
Here is some tea.
Thank you very much.
- Enjoy.
- Thank you mother.
Mr. Faruk what are these?
Tools to avoid jinns and evil eyes.
This is a prayer.
And these...
Charms I wrote with special pens
on special papers.
Charms?
Charms.
Look.
Every Arabic letter
corresponds to a number.
This is called Ebced. When they are alligned
effective charms are formed.
I got it.
Is it something like Kaballah?
That is a little bit different
because it has alchemy in it.
So what do these all mean?
They are forprotection.
If jinns are this cleverand
dangerous creatures...
Why are they afraid of
these simple letters?
Because...
These letters you call simple have
devestating results forthem.
How so?
Just like a small virus
killing a big animal.
But we know the certainty of a virus.
We know how it affects organisms.
Ms. Ebru. Jinns are cretures made
from the posion of heat, light and fire.
So they are on the electromagnetic waves
of a specific frequency.
Because these charms differently
reflect light with various combinations...
It is not so unbeliavable that they have an effect
on jinns since light is an electromagnetic wave.
It seems you like using scientifýc terms.
Ms. Ebru, some of these patients
should only be cured by doctors.
I accpet that.
- Good.
But there are some cases
that you cannot cure.
Only we can cure them.
Still, you have no evidence.
What kind of evidance do you want?
If jinns are creatures that can talk
and eat as you say...
We need to have some sort of
concrete evidence, right?
Ms. Ebru, does science accept the existance of dreams?
- Of course.
So, is there any concrete evidence
regarding dreams?
No. So, you're saying...
But dreams have been accpeted by everyone
so they are not debatable.
However, only some people and religons accept
the existance of jinns. That is two different things.
Jinn means the thing that hides in the dark.
Yes, it is diffiýcult to see and
touch it but easy to feel it.
Such so that the chill you will feel around it.
Is like nothing else.
- Fear is not evidence Mr. Faruk.
Psychiatry is based on this fact.
We won't see eye to eye
unless there is concrete evidence.
WiýII we do that even if there is
concrete evidence doctor.
You tell me.
We'll see.
Look, this is alchemy.
It used to be science and
now you call it witchcraft.
Faruk, son,
you should eat something first.
No thank, I'm not hungry.
But Ms. Ebru, my mother's food is very tasty.
- Some othertime...
Thank you but we should get going.
This is the patient I told you about,
we are going to Muðla.
Kübra DURAN.
May you have a safe journey, son.
- Mother.
So did you get involved in this jinn business in Adana
ordid it start in Bursa?
It all started when i was a kid.
Are there any others in yourfamily
that engage in exorcism?
No, this is not about family.
Let's not get into these things but
it began when I was a kid.
There is something called
lending a hand.
Lending a hand?
What is it exactly?
Think of it this way,
you learn from a mentorand start applications.
In exchange fora fee?
- No fee.
Really?
- At least in my case.
But this is not true for others
in yourprofession.
Ms. Ebru, look around you,
there are all sorts of people.
Where exactly are we going?
We are going to Kýbledere village.
It is just 100 kiometers from here.
I don't know the roads very well,
I left here when I was little.
I will stop and ask Refýka fordirections.
Refika?
The mother of our patient.
Let me give her a call.
Hello.
Refýka, this is Ebru.
Yes dear.
We are almost there but we're a bit lost.
I passed that.
Yes.
But I didn't turn to the Köyceðiz road.
I made the wrong turn but now
I know where we're going.
There is a house up ahead.
- Yes.
Shall we ask?
- Let's ask.
Hello
Hello, welcome.
- Hello, sorry to bother you
It's okay.
- Hello
We will go all the way down that road.
What is it with all the cameras.
We are conducting a research
about kýbledere village.
Turn off the cameras, turn them off.
- Faruk.
We're recording.
You say you spent yourchildhood here
but you don't recognize anything
you're right. Didn't you see that man?
First he was nice to us and then he tried to beat us.
This is a very suspicious place.
Ms. Ebru,
should we go back to Muðla.
Can you ask the jinns for directions.
They must be looking forus right now.
How so?
This area is a great place for jinns
and demons.
Semerkandi says
if there is a mountain where the sun rises,
a mountain where the sun sets,
and a stream in the middle...
all the shadows in the middle are
fýIled with jinns.
It's as if he was describing this place.
What was that noiit
came from overthere.
It sounded like someone crying.
Yes, a woman's crying.
Stop. I'll film this.
Wait forme.
It came from here.
- Keep walking.
Slowly, be careful.
Did you hearthat?
- I did.
Faruk hoca wait.
It's coming from here.
Be careful.
Can you see anything?
Faruk hoca!
Ebru calm down!!
Ebru are you okay!
- Fine, where is it?!
No, no Ebru it's gone. It was going to bite me!!
- Ebru calm down it's gone
did it go overthere?!
- See, it's not there, it's gone.
Come on let's get into the car.
- Come on let's get out of here
Damn it,
I dropped the camera, is it broken?
No, it's fýne.
Okay, go to the car!
- You go ahead.
Come!
I am an animal lover
but I was scared to death.
I'll put it out if you're bothered.
- No, it's not that.
Since you're a doctor.
When I was a third year in med school
we had a teacherthat told us...
...about the harmful effects of smoking
called selim gürgen
but he was an addict too.
Whose graves are these?
Are those bones?
Curious.
Faruk hoca don't go in.
What are those.
They are bones.
Aren't these masonic signs?
- But this is different.
How so?
- I'm gueesing they did something here.
What?
When the animals of villagers
suddenly died...
they would sacrifýce them
and let the blood flow to the ground.
And they would position
the bones like this
this is a strange wishing tree.
They have hung everything here,
are those intestines!
Oh my God they're on me.
They're in my hair.
- Wait a second...
Graveyard, mausoleum,
the bone charm, symbols...
What is it?
Bring the light.
Bring it.
- What does it say?
Seven-one-seven-fýve.
Seventyone-seventyfiýve.
- Someone carved it wishing forsomething.
Some wishing trees are just forevil.
No one wishes forevil.
Someone who wants his enemy to die,
would cover his hair, nail orbone
with a cloth, put the name on it and
place it on the tree. It's a century old tradition
The smell is awful.
- This area is bad.
Are you okay?
Ebru, are you okay?
Are you okay?
- I'm fýne, I'm fýne.
The smell made me dizzy.
I'll be fýne now.
Look at the sheep!
- Don't run them over.
Okay okay I stopped.
Look how cute this little one is!
Hey!
You startled my sheep.
Okay we stopped.
- Sorry.
We're lost, can you tell us the way.
What are you looking for?
- We want to go to the town of aþaðýyaðýz.
What are you going to do there?
Do you know Refika Duran,
she had a husband Bilal Duran, he died
Bilal Duran from Kýbledere village.
They moved a while ago but used to live
in an old Greek mansion. Do you know?
You're way off course and if I tell you to go back
you'll have a lot of ground to cover.
Just continue straight ahead.
- Okay.
You will come to an intersection.
Take the left.
You will see lights and
keep going on that road
The house will be straight ahead.
- Thanks.
Okay?
- Okay, thank you very much. Thanks.
Have a safe journey.
I hope he gave us the right directions.
I turned left just like he said.
- Yes.
There are lights up ahead.
- There it is, we found it.
Faruk hoca.
What is that overthere?
- What?
What are those people doing?
- Who??
Recird this.
- Who did you see, what happened?
It's already recording. Turn on the flash.
- Give it to me.
QUICK, DON'TYOU SEE IT?
Where, I can't see it?
- Look, who is there with him?
I just saw it. Hold on,
isn't that the shepherd from before?
Definitely not?
- It's him.
How is that possible?
- Okay okay, we passed it.
Anyway...
Curious.
Keep going.
We've been driving forhours.
Hello Refýka.

Yes, I see the mosque on the right.
Okay, passed the mosque

- Right away.
Hoca, would you like to drink something, water, ayran?
- I'll have some called ayran.
Okay.
Did you drive around a lot?
Refýka we got lost and
asked someone for directions.
First he jumped us and then
we were attacked by a dog.
Where?
- Somewhere along the village road.
These places have changed,
...you were little when you left.
- I was and I've forgotten it
Come Fatma, ourguests have arrived.
- Hello.
Faruk hoca.
Fatma do you remember Ebru?
Fatma we spoke you know.

I said turn it off!
- Wait a miniute okay.
I'll turn it off.
Fatma, why are you so angry?
Why are you here?!
- Sister, calm down.
I'm not going to calm down!
Aren't you ashamed!
You have a camera and you've brought this hodja!
You need to trust me

- Uncle Osman.
Can you tell me what exactly

Kübra was struck by an evil spirit,
this family is troubled anyway.
Troubled?
- This story...
goes back to Kýbledere village.
This village...
Damned...
- Wait a minute Osman wait a minute!
Okay, calm down.
What is happening here?
What are you doing here
with those cameras?
Nothing, we're just talking.
Sit down.
Are you here to film?
We just have a few questions and
then we'll leave, don't worry.
Our village has nothing to do
with these events.
Fine.
You can't film here.
Get the hell out of here!
Okay calm down!!
- Get the fuck out of here!!! I'll fuck you!!!!
Bastards!!! Fuck off!!
- Okay okay calm down.
What the hell is this,
people go nuts when we mention Kýbledere.
It has nothing to do with that village
I told there are strange people here.
Yes...
It's late, Kübra must have woken up,
let's at least make it to dinner.
Let's go.
This dog just wouldn't shut up
It's okay darling.
- Hodja?
Mom?
Let's recap from the beginning.
You said it was the night before the wedding?
- Yes.
What happened that night?
Mom, can I show him the CD?
What CD?
The night of the celebrations were recorded.
That would be great,
do you think that's possible?
I'll show you after dinner.
- We must watch that Esra.
Okay.
Faruk hodja stop the recording so
I can set the angle.
Okay start.
Faruk hodja,
can you say what they're saying?
It says...
What language is this?
- Aramaic.
Jesus spoke to the demons in the
desert in Aramaic
And?
So, the jinn that hated Jesus
the most spoke this language.
What does it say here?
Seven.
Seven.
One.
Seven.
Five.
7775.
Isn't this the same numberwe saw
on that weird wishing tree?
Yes, yes.
Are you talking about the tree at the back of the village?
- Yes, what is it?
One night Kübra wasn't in her room
and we looked everywhere.
She walked all the way out
there in hersleep.
Faruk hodja?
Can I look at yourhouse from the outside?
- Sure.
What is it? Wait for me.
There is something...
something in this house.
Kübra.
Kübra.
Ebru.
Is it really you?
Darling you look so beautiful.
My dear Kübra.
I am here as yourfriend and a doctor.
So do i call you Doctor Ebru?
You just call me Ebru.
Do you know that she wanted to be a doctor
when she was a kid?
And you wanted to be a cop.
- A cop?
Even...
We have a picture wearing uniforms
do you remember?
Of course I do.
Can you fýnd it?
- Of course.
Kübra,
I want to get right to the point.
Afterthe celebrations in the morning
you told yourmother you were going to die
I don't remember.
How about what happened that night?
I rememberhearing a voice.
What kind of voice?
- Awoman's voice.
Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
It kept saying the same thing.
- What?
Kill him, kill him.
The man you were about to marry?
- His name was Erdal.
Did you and Erdal everfight?
- Sometimes.
Did he ever hit you?
No, we loved each other.
- Okay dear.
That night you went to the tree...
The night I walked in my sleep?
Kübra, did you hearany voices that night?
I didn't but...
When I think about that night
I see a coffiin.
What kind of a coffiýn?
Cold.
I'm inside and I can't breathe.
It's like a hand is choking me.
My nails pierce my skin.
I want to yell but I can't.
I call for help... No one helps me.
Then I die.
And...
And?
And I'm reborn as a baby.
- A baby with an eye on yourforehead?
Yes.
No mouth, just an eye here.
Okay, calm down.
Take a deep breath.
It's overnow.
Stop recording.
Afterthat, the police took Kübra.
The family of the groom
pressed charges.
The police wouldn't let us see Kübra.
Then the doctors came
and took herto the hospital.
My daughterwas there fortwo years.
- Mom, come on, let it go.
Okay, calm down.
When did your husband die?
Bilal?
He died the day Kübra was born.
Heart attack?
He fell suddenly and was
foaming at the mouth.
Could be epilepsy.
What was the result of the autopsy?
No, no he wasn't sick like that.
Mom! Mom!
- Refýka!
Calm down.
My daughterwas very pretty as a child.
She was like an angel.
I did everything for her.
Everyone envied her.
I had charms made
and nothing happened.
I hung evil eyes all overthe house.
But I couldn't protect her.
- Ms. Refýka.
With yourpremission,
I'd like to throw away all the evil eye beads.
Why?
Evil eyes are the strength elixir of
demons and jinns.
But we use them to avoid evil,
that's what the hodja says.
Which hodja?
The eye on the bead...
is the eye of satan.
The single eye is the symbol of satan since Babylon.
And you keep evil eyes to shield
from satan all the while seeking his help.
Take these.
And these.
Kübra.
Take these.
There are some here.
Okay.
Are all these your cameras?
Afew are mine the rest
belongs to the university.
Are yu always going to fýIm?
Don't worry I won't.
Throw these.
- Okay.
Why the rush,
can't you do it tomorrow?
There is no time, the jinns will be
more aggresive now that we're here
I need to fýgure this out before
something happens to her.
What about that baby
with a single eye?
Yes. All those possessed by a jinn
see the same thing.
Why?
- I don't know, maybe we'll fýnd out together.
Okay, I'm heading upstairs.
Kübra.
Are you okay?
I'm fýne.
Look, don't be afraid, okay?
Yourdoctorfriend,
yourmother, sister, aunt...
They are all here.
If there is a creature that bothers you...
Let it be afradi of you.
We will pray to God
togetherto rid you of this evil.
Okay?
Okay.
Let's turn out the lights.
Open yourpalm.
What am i going to do?
Rub it as hard as you can.
Like this?
Kübra.
Close your eyes.
Okay. They're closed.
Now place your hands
on yourface.
Like you're praying.
Inhale the smell on yourpalms.
What's... What is it?!
O Lord almighty!
We seek refuge in you from evil.
My hands are burning!!
Lord! Protect this innocent girl
from the wrath of the jinn!!
Show mercy!
My hands!!!
Lord, we take shelter in your mercy!!
Protect us!!
Ebru.
Do you see?
- Kübra what did you do?
Turn it off.
He's here... He's here.
He's here.
I'm scared.
I'm scared.
He's here, he's here.
He's here.
Come.
I'll show you something.
Kübra drew this on my hand, didn't she?
- Yes.
Do you see?
The same is here in this book.
What does that mean?
It means mirror.
Mirror?
- The book is maybe a thousand years old.
But Kübra drew the same text
on my hand.
But why is that so important?
Because forus,
jinns are inside mirrors.
BThis is exactly what it says.
If a jinn completely takes over
a young body.
It sends a message that says mirror.
Is my daughterpossessed by a jinn.
- Definitely, and the most dangerous kind.
Now, I need an empty room.
Two mirrors and candles, okay?
- Okay.
Mom, will the next house do?
- Of course.
Okay.
- Okay.
Faruk Hodja I think the mirrors are
an excuse you're stalling.
The otherday you covered that woman
with a black cloth and she was instantly cured.
Right.
- Why didn't that work here.
This situation is different.
- How so?
Because the spell I used didn't work.
And?
- The jinn that has possesed Kübra.
Is very dangerous,
it won't leave the body until it dies or kills her.
The cruelest jinn!
- Be quiet, they'll hear you.
Aren't we here to help?
Yes but you have to give up
when you know you won't succeed.
Kübra's motherwill allow us
to take herto the hospital.
I'll end it if I feel I can't help her.
- Promise?
Promise.
- Okay.
It is now 02:03
I am Doctor Ebru Karaduman.
The fýrst step of the visual phenomenon
presentation has been complete.
As I have suspected Kübra...
as insomnia and personality disorder...
that began
with a bioelectric activity trauma.
While the patient gave coherent answers
during ourfýrst meeting.
She has manifested metaphysical beliefs...
during hersession with Faruk.
Paranormal activity will be monitored
with the patient.
Kübra.
Kübra.
Good morning everyone.
- Good morning.
Sorry I was late, I slept perfectly.
- It's okay. - Thank you, you didn't
have to go through all that trouble.
Good morning Faruk hodja.
- Good morning.
Ms. Ebru.

- There you go hodja. - Ms. Esra what happened
to the mirrors, let's begin before it gets dark.
Everything is ready at the house.
- Let's start afterwe've had ourcoffee.
Okay.
- Of course.
Don't worry I'm fýne.
The room of mirrors.
There you go.
The mirrors are up there.
- Okay.
Shall we come?
- No, you wait down here.
Ms. Ebru.
Faruk hodja is about to begin the calling of
jinns in the room of mirrors
supposedly the best way
to communicate with jinns.
Ms. Ebru can we begin now?
- Go ahead.
Ms. Ebru.
I will go underthe cover now.
If you have any complaints give me the camera.
You go ahead,
I'll pass you the camera.
Are you ready?
Begin.
I hid in the darkness of the night cover.
The evil spirit behind the mirrors
come here and show me
what you feed from!
Ms. Ebru.
- Yes.
The jinn is right behind you.
Don't! Don't you move.
Okay.
- Don't turn around.
What should I do?
- Come.
Come over here.
- Okay.
SDon't come near us.
Okay.
Jinn.
What do you want with Kübra?
Jinn!
What do you want from Kübra?!
Faruk hodja!!
Faruk hodja!
Faruk hodja are you okay?
Ebru are you okay?!
- I'm fine Esra I'm fine!
I'm fýne.
I'm fýne.
Faruk hodja are you okay?
How did this happen?
When you ask jinns a question
they answerwith symbols.
What does that mean?
According to alchemy it means soap stone
but according to black magic...
Toilet spell.
- Toilet spell?
Mom.
- What?
Did someone put a spell on us.
- I have no idea.
It is also called the death spell,
it's very dangerous.
Is there a toilet here that touches
the ground and sees the sun?
Yes, in the garden at the back.
Get out.
Faruk hodja claims that this symbol
was made by the jinn.
What the hell is this guy doing?
What's that! What are those!!
What is this! What are these!!
- What are these Faruk hodja?
Oh my God who put these here!?
Is this meat?
Mom!
What are they!
What are they!
Who did this!
Refika please try to calm down.
But look at this!
It's okay.
I don't understand.
Mom, what are these?
These are disguasting, they smell awful.
Faruk hodja,
are you okay back there?
Refika.
My daughter, my daughter...
What's that!
That's...
What the hell?
Oh my God.
- What is that?
How, how, why?
Mom!!!
- What's that?!!
Oh my God!!
Esra!
Faruk hodja! What is that!?
Oh my God!!

Faruk hodja!

Esra hold on!!
- Hold it, okay, slowly!
Okay slowly.
- Hang tight!
You're doing fine!
- Come come!
My daughter. Who did all this?
I don't know,
who put all this here.
Oh God how di they do it,
who did it?!
My poor daughter!
Fatma why don't you say something?
Mother, who put these here?
And you're asking me!!
Look to yourpast!!
What the hell are you talking about!!
Speak if you know something!!
- Look at me!
What!!!
- Refýka.
What are you saying!
- Enough!!!!
Enough!! What are you doing!!!
Look at this mess!!
Look at Kübra!!
Sister!!!
- Esra.
Please calm down.
Why are you behaving like this,
please we can't solve anything this way Esra.
Right now, we are in the old house of
Bilal Duran's family.
Awhile ago,
we found some items realting to witchcraft...
amulets, speels, babies,
hairsamples inside the toilet...
and also animal parts.
This makes me believe some people
otherthan Faruk Akat may be involved but...
I'm not sure yet.
I seek refuge in you...
from the witch that has bound us
with this curse.
What is this?
Look, poisoned liquids have been sprinkled
overthe brain and heart
Look this is yourname, Refýka
and yourhusband's name Bilal.
Is this a spell to seperate lovers
ormarried couples?
- No.
- So what is it?
It is called sihri-cenne.
It's a fetus spell.
What?
It is done fora fetus in a mother's womb.
Here is what it says.
Yourfetus shall be cursed.
Its flesh dirty
Its blood poisioned.
Its fate sealed.
Herfathershall die the day its born.
Fourteen days after her23rd birthday...
...the cruelest jinns shall eat hersoul.
Kübra was 23 the night
before herwedding.
Wait a minute.
So Kübra was cursed
in hermother's womb.
And it came into effect
when she turned 23?
I'm not so sure about that.
Why 23
Kübra!
- My daughter! My daughter!
- Kübra!
Mother...
I'm dying!
We need to go to the hospital now.
- No, we can't stop at this point.
- What are you talking about?
There is no progress.
This is something that happened
before Kübra was born.
The spells we found
in the toilet prove that!
Faruk hodja please don't talk to me
about those nasty things!
Look, she's worse now.
We're almost done doctor
don't give up now!
Faruk hodja...
Kübras personality disorder
and we know how to cure her.
Are you talking about the treatment
she received fortwo years?
If the diagnosis was wrong she might have not
responded to the treatment.
- Doctor please let me.
- No, it's not possible.
Look, we've found the spell,
we're almost done here.
Rememberwhy you filmed
this whole thing!
- I have what I need.
- No!
You need to prove it.
I am at the front line not you!
If you're talking about the mirror room...
I think that you obstructed
the view with incenses...
and wrote the symbol with the fumes!
And did I put the spells in the
bathroom too?
We are not comparing science
to religion here, please!
Ms. Ebru...
I, Faruk Akat...
If I can't save Kübra
I will be wrong and you will win.
Isn't that what you wanted?
For Kübra...
for yourfriend's life...
Let me.
Okay, fýne.
But this will be the last time!
- Last time!
- Okay.
- How is Kübra?
- Same. She's terrifýed.
She keeps saying I saw him,
I saw him.
Esra, I need a biggerroom.
Okay. We have a warehouse at the entrance
of the village, will that do?
- Let's go.
- Okay.
I will have to pin you down.
I need to set the frame.
Okay.
Okay, now it's clear.
- Are you comfortable Faruk hodja?
- Yes.
- Be careful of this switch it will end the recording.
- Okay, okay.
Right now Faruk Akat is attempting
the second exorcism
Refika...
Go overthere.
Kübra.
Is it still here?
It is.
Where exactly?
There.
Can you describe what you're seeing?
It has long dark hair.
Woman or man?
Woman.
What's her name?
Sare.
Sare can you hear me?
She can.
Who does she want to kill?
She says, an eye foran eye.
Jinn...
There are spells here
that have fed you for24 years.
King Solomon, who rules all the jinns of Egypt,
Babylon and Israel...
and his God, we swear...
if you don't leave this girl now...
I will burn you alive in this cursed place.
Tell that God of yours...
I'm not afraid of him!
This is my last warning to you
If you don't leave this body...
you will die.
- It died, the jinn died!
- Enough!
Are you okay?
It died, the jinn died.
The jinn died.
You're saved.
- Refika, it's okay.
- Kübra...
Your daughter is saved.
- Kübra, my darling daughter!
- Yourgirl is saved.
- May God bless you hodja.
- May God bless us all.
I haven't seen my daughter
this well for years.
What about the people who cast the spell...
Can we find them?
Kübra is saved,
that's all that matters.
Don't worry, God will punish them.
It is 02:05. Faruk Akat...
...oblitarted, the jinn called Sare...
...and killed her.
Surprisingly, the blood pressure
and heartbeat ofKübra Turan...
...Iook normal.
Nausea, vomiting and fever...
...that was present four hours ago
have passed.
The patient claims that
afterall these years...
...she doesn't feel the jinn around
herand she feels fýne.
Who do you think cast the spell?
Someone close to the family
orsomeone very jealous.
Is it this easy to cast a spell?
Have you heard of something
called Dabbe?
I have but I don't know
what it means.
Dabbe is a sign of the apocalypse
according to the Quran.
It says that it will surround the earth
like a web and enterevery home.
Doesn't that sound like the internet?
The internet?
Think about it.
It will surround the earth like a web...
and enter every home.
Www...
World Wiýde Web.
The web that surround the earth.
No way.
Ýnternet, Ms. Ebru.
Is the biggest sign of the apocalypse.
It is the internet that has caused
the increase in spells.
You can now access the most dangerous
black magic spells with one click on the internet.
What can be more frightening than this?
So who uploads these spells on the internet?
I don't know if it's people or jinns.
Anyway, this is a long debate.
I'm going to bed.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Kübra?
What is it?
- I don't know. I think something happened to Kübra.
- How?
- Kübra! Kübra isn't in herroom!
- Sister, calm down!
- Okay, calm down.
Mom!
Something happened to my aunt!
Fatma! Fatma!
Aunt! Aunt!
- Fatma who did this to you?
- Fatma!
- I'm calling for an ambulance.
- Do ot, quickly.
Refika calm down.
The tree.
- There is nothing.
- What tree?
- The wishing tree.
- Who?
- At the wishing tree.
- Is it Kübra?
Ebru, ready the car.
- Kübra!
- Be careful!
I don't die!
If I die a thousand times...
...I come back a thousand times!
This body...
will find me.
Kübra! Don't!
Quickly!
It's because of me!
Okay.
Okay. Faruk hodja,
you're not coming. Don't.
- Close the door!
- Doctorwhat are you doing?
Don't doctorme.
This is all yourfault, shut the door.
Ebru calm down.
I don't know what happened.
You're a fraud!
I told you we should take herto the hospital.
Shut the door!
Something's wrong,
this shouldn't have happened.
Shut it!
Fraud!
Kübra is fine.
She's in the hospital.
Which hospital?
Fatma!
And yet you're still not ashamed
to keep filming?
Recording will continue
until the matteris resolved.
- Kübra's father...
- Harun?
Do you know why he died?
Why?
Kübra was born...
a small baby.
We called my brother
he came.
He started choking her
with his two hands...
...saying 'the child of satan,
the child of satan'.
I pushed him.
And he fell.
There were black foams
coming out of his mouth.
His eyes grew big.
His tongue swelled up.
My brother...
he died in front of my eyes hodja.
I always asked myself.
Always wished I hadn't saved Kübra.
I don't know.
Before he died...
he said.
Sare...
Sare.
That was the name of the jinn.
How did my brother
by this big mansion?
He was a poor villager.
He bought lands, mansions.
He nevertold me.
Fatma...
Tell me someone
who can talk about Kýbledere.
Ýlyas.
Ýlyas Aloðlu.
He is the only villager
that lives in Kýbledere.
What did you do Bilal Duran?
Who did you hurt?
71. 75.
What are you?
Hidayet hello.
This numberalways comes up in this story.
7175.
Do you know what it means?
Hold on a second.
In the 1600's there was a half Christian
half Muslim sect.
I think I saw this number in pictures in their books
but I'm not sure.
How can I see those pictures?
It's a matterof life or death.
Okay Faruk I'll e-mail them to you
if I can fýnd them.
- Please hurry.
- Okay, I'll look into it.
Thanks.
What now!
- Are you okay?
- I'm fýne, how about you?
I'm fýne. What is it?
Don't worry about me.
How is Kübra?
Not so good, I spoke to her doctor.
Hodja sorry I yelled at you.
I was in shock.
- It's okay.
- How is that okay?
Look what happened to you.
I dragged you into this.
I don't know why I came here anymore.
For yourown ambitions orfor Kübra,
you mean?
I'm very confused.
You mean well Ebru.
What are you doing here?
I'm looking fora road
that leads to Kýbledere.
The guy dropped me off here and
directed me to the back of the hill.
What business do you have in Kýbledere?
The place is in ruins.
This thing will be solved in Kýbledere, Ebru.
Supposedly there is a guy named Ýlyas Aloðlu.
Fatma said I should find him.
Faruk hodja,
this is over, let it go.
You couldn't succeed?
Let it go before you make a bigger mess.
I won't stop until this is over!
Kýbledere.
We're fýnally here.
People used to live here in the past.
Now jinns live her.
So, jinns live in those ruins?
We'll see.
- Come, come. Come here.
- What is it?
Film this.
Again?
7175.
Hodja, you fýgured out everything
except the secret of this number.
Hodja give me the tripod.
Strange.
What kind of a place is this Ebru?
This is a big village.
What interests me is...
...why did all those people abandon this place?
Why did everyone leave their homes.
Are you asking me Faruk hodja?
Of course I'm asking you.
Aren't you and Kübra from this village?
I think the soudn came from overthere.
Look, I think it came from voerthere.
Don't you rememberanything
about this village?
No.
I don't.
One reason.
We need only one reason.
There should be a reason
why people left their village.
Then go online and google
Kýbledere village. Look at the old dates.
You can fýnd lots of strange stories
in newspapers about this place.
You tell me.
We spoke to all the villagers, they're all superstitions.
They still believe it, don't you see?
They were scared so they ran.
Superstition!
That's all you know.
That's all you always say.
Let's fýnd this Ýlyas and
see if it is superstition ornot.
How are we ever going to find him,
we've been searching for an hour.
How should I know,
we'll look for a house with its lights on.
Faruk hodja stop.
There is a scorpion on the wall.
7175 again.
- So Faruk hodja?
- I told you I didn't know what it means.
I called a friend who knows soemthing about
these numbers.
He's going to send me some pictures.
We'll see when they arrive.
Got it? Okay?
Okay. Don't be mad.
Faruk hodja!
What?
Faruk hodja
something passed by behind you.
Stop. Don't go.
Something black, I saw it.
- What black thing?
- It ran inside, there!
Faruk hodja don't go,
maybe it's a dog or an animal...
Faruk hodja!
Hodja!
Faruk hodja!
Where are you!
I looked inside and it wasn't there.
Are you okay?
Okay, okay I'm here.
- Why did yu leave and go inside?
- Calm down. Okay.
I'm here.
I looked around there's nothing there.
- Okay? Are you alright?
- Okay, I'm fýne, let's fýnd this house.
Okay, come on.
- Walk this way.
- Okay.
Faruk hodja.
Faruk hodja where are you going,
no one lives in a place like this.
Let's go.
What is that?
Strange.
What the hell is this?
Ebru!
Yes?
We found it.
Wait for me.
- Come.
- Together.
Ýlyas Aloðlu?
That's me.
Mr. Ýlyas, my name is Ebru.
I am a psychiatrist.
Before I explain why we're here
I'd like to tell you about the cameras-
There's no need.
I know why you're here. Come, come.
We'll talk upstairs.
- Isn't this the shepherd we saw on the road?
- Yes, yes.
- Please take off yourshoes.
- Of course.
Please come this way.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Shall I leave this here?
- Okay.
Now, brother Ýlyas.
What happened to these people here?
The sins of two people cursed
the entire village.
Who are these tow people?
Bilal Duran...
and Remzi Karaduman.
- Remzi Karaduman?
- Yes.
Do you know him?
- My father?
- Yes, yourfather.
See, 24 years ago...
Kübra's father Bilal
and yourfather Remzi...
Started looking for a treasure
with the help of a jinn.
- Jinn?
- Afemake jinn. Was hername Sare?
Yes, Sare. Sare was a member of a jinn clan
that could live inside a human body.
The Suzula clan.
Avery dangerous jinn clan
who knew the places of treasures.
After Bilal and Remzi found the treasure,
I mean the gold...
they decided to kill Sare.
How?
When Sare was inside a human body,
they buried her underthe cursed tree.
Is that the wishing tree behind the road?
- Yes.
- Hold on a second.
Do you have any proof that Uncle Bilal and
my fatherwere treasure hunters?
How did two...
poor villagers suddenly became rich?
Bilal bought himself a big mansion.
He had tons of money in the bank.
Yourfather...
went to lzmir.
Did you everthink
where all that land came from?
The people who killed Uncle Bilal...
- are they jinns from the same clan as Sare?
- Yes.
- They killed yourfathertoo.
- Mr. Ýlyas!
My fatherdied in a carcrash.
Hodja!
They made the accident happen!
- This is absurd!
- Calm down.
Doctor!
And they drew you here.
You have to be very careful.
Theirhatred and revenge neverends.
Do they want Kübra's body for Sare?
Yes. That's why they didn't
let herget married.
They will ressurect Sare
as a virgin in her body.
- Reincarnation.
- Reincarnation?
Reincarnation is the work of jinns.
They transferall the life force
of someone to another brain...
and completely destroy his past life.
Reincarnation...
is being struck by a jinn.
So when Kübra and Sare
are the same age...
they will give her Sare's soul...
- and take herto theirworld.
- Yes.
Look.
Look at these.
What are these?
Look.
This is what happened to the people
of Kýbledere.
Bilal and Remzi.
Afterthey sold the gold
they gave some money to the villagers.
All of them were cursed.
Their kids were born with defects.
They became ill.
People went crazy, t
hey committed suicide!
Look, I've only told yu about this.
Why us?
Because I want this curse to end.
But Ýlyas, how do you all of this?
My wife told me.
Is yourwife here?
My wife is not human.
She is a jinn.
Is she here right now Ýlyas?
Yes.
She can see you.
But you can't see her.
- What's hername?
- Zahuriyeþ.
Is she a Muslim?
WiýII Zahuriyeþ help us?
WiýII Zahuriyeþ help you?
Zahuriyeþ.
We mean well.
We don't care about you
or your husband.
We want to help
that innocent girl Kübra.
Wiill you help Kübra?
Zahuriyeþ.
What is 7175?
Help us.
- What is it?
- Zahuriyeþ wants you to leave.
- But Mr. Ýlyas?
- No buts!
She is afraid of Zuzula jinns.
She says they can harm us
because we are talking to you.
- Why?
- Because she says you killed one of them.
The jinn that possessed Kübra,
she called herself Sare.
That's not Sare, they say that because
they want Kübra 'to turn into Sare.
- Sare is buried underthe cursed tree.
- Should we go to the cursed tree?
Go now. We told you everything.
Go before you put us or yourselves in danger.
- Get out!
- Get out! Go.
Go! Go!
I don't believe any of this,
this is absurd.
- Enough!
- How are we evergoing to solve this thing?
What's this? What are these?
What's that? What is that?
- Oh my God, it's blood!
- Ebru calm down.
- I thought there was nobody here?
- Ebru calm down.
Is this a joke, who did this?
Who did this?
It's all overthe car,
it's all overthe place!
Ebru calm down!
- Oh God, who did this?
- Ebru geet into the car, calm down!
Okay. It's going to be okay Ebru
What's going on?
Get in the car!
Go!
I don't believe
my fatherwas involved in this.
I think the best thing to do is pray.
So all this happened
becasue Sare was murdered?
Look, look Ebru.
According to this book, in orderto lift the curse
because an innocent jinn was killed...
we need to dig out the jinn
from its burial spot...
and wrap herin a holy cloth and
bury it somewhere.
Arab nomads used to bury the jinns
they accidentaly killed in the desert to avoid the curse.
So we're going to the cursed tree?
First lets drop by the town and
get a shovel and shroud.
Ebru!
I found it Ebru!
Are you going to open it?
I don't know.
What's this?
What's in here?
Faruk hodja!
Where are you going?
Give me the camera.
Ebru. Don't film me
when I'm burying the jinn.
Okay.
Do you need any help?
No.
What happened?
Is it over?
It's over.
I buried it.
What's that?
Calm down.
Ebru calm down.
Faruk hodja.
Zuzula jinn clan.
I have given you Sare's dead body.
If you can hear me...
Sare...
She is in the ground with a clean body.
Leave Kübra alone.
We did our part.
And you stay away from that body!
It's done.
- What do you mean?
- It's over.
They are gone.
Oh God, please bless my dauughter
with a serene life
Amen.
Mom, stop exaggerating.
No. It's nothing,
I have to talk to you when I'm there.
It's about dad.
Not now,
I'll talk to you when I arrive
Okay.
See you. Bye bye.
Dad.
How is she Refika?
She's is sleeping.
Okay, let's leave her alone.
What about Esra.
Where is Mine?
She's with her grandmother.
Okay, good.
This has been going on
forthousands of years.
Not you, not me,
we can't change anything.
I'm not sure about anything
Faruk hodja.
It's betterthan
being sure of everything
Trust me
Anyway.
Thank you for yourcooperation
and thank you for your patience.
- Ýlyas! Ýlyas!
- What is it?
The guy we talked to.
He just called.
He said it was a matterof life or death.
He said to come quickly.
He says if you don't go hodja
Kübra will die.
Okay, okay.
Don't worry I'm leaving.
You stay with Kübra, she's scared.
- Please.
- Okay, I'm here.
- Okay, I'm leaving.
- Okay, go. Come, sit here.
Faruk hodja!
Faruk hodja take the camera!
What don't you fýIm here!
This has been bothering me
since the morning.
What is it?
Oh my God!
Who put this here?
I found this magical element...
Hidden in one of my clothes.
I don't know what it means but
there is a picture of Kübra and me on it.
I don't know
why someone did this but...
this fýgure looks like it is peeing.
And this looks like a toilet.
I don't know if this is related to the toilet
spell we saw before.
I am really scared.
That is why I will be
using this secret camera.
Yes.
What's going on there?
Something's happening.
- Hello Hidayet?
- Hello Faruk.
Did you look at the pictures
I sent you about 7175?
I did and downloaded them
onto my laptop.
- Did you figure them out?
- Open them now.
Wait,
I'm in the car and pulling over.
I'm looking at
one of the pictures now.
This is the picture that sect uses.
Go on.
7175 is a 2000 yearold code Faruk.
Tell me.
According to Christians,
Jesus was killed on the cross...
but according to Islam
he wasnt crucified.
Yes, the Quran mentions it
Jesus wasn't crucifýed and killed.
Continue.
Now write 7175 on a piece of paper.
On a paper...
Yes.
Then write the Arabic version of
those numbers underneath.
Read it.
- Vivo.
- Vivo means I'm alive Faruk. In Latin.
Just like it says in the Quran.
7175 sect members, who don't believe that
Jesus died orwas crucified...
have said.
I'm reading it.
The cursed spirit that cried
of hell in front of the cross.
You couldn't put
the spikes of hell on Jesus' forehead.
Evil nails couldn't pierce his clean palms.
I, your God, didn't entrust
his pure soul to your cursed souls.
Jesus, my servant, is with me.
Know and let it be known that
Jesus is not dead, he lives.
And Jesus said.
Vivo.
This group, who believed that
Jesus was alive during that time...
turned the word vivo into a code and
that's how 7175 emerged.
Back to yourthing.
Jinns which were killed and
buried by people...
let the others know they lived
by using this code.
Faruk.
Sare.
The female jinn.
So she isn't dead?
If you open the grave of a dead jinn...
the curse is lifted.
If you open the grave of a living jinn...
the curse...
incrases.
Sare.
Was buried alive.
They imprisoned herin the cursed tree.
Oh my God.
Oh my God, what did I do?
What did you do?
What did you do?
Ýlyas.
Ýlyas what happened?
Where is the doctor?
Kübra!
Kübra what happened to you?
Kübra!
What is going on Ýlyas?
That motherand daughter
planned everything.
They're going to give the doctor's body
to Sare instead of Kübra!
Why did you leave the house?
- You called me.
- That's a lie!
I don't even have a phone!
What are you talking about Ýlyas!
The Zuzula clan killed my wife.
They are here hodja.
They are everywhere.
Ýlyas!
- It's too late now hodja.
- Ýlyas what happened?
Ebru!
They took Ebru.
Body exchange.
They will give Ebru to Sare.
Kýbledere!
Refika?
Esra?
Don't you fear God?
Are you not afraid of God?
Yusuf in the bottom of the well...
God...
Yusuf...
Ebru.
Ebru, open youreyes.
Why?
What did I ever do to you?
Right.
You did nothing Ebru.
It was yourfather.
Yourfather Remzi.
He sought out the treasure for years.
He chased the money.
Yourfatherwas the reason
my daughterwas possessed by jinns.
He gathered the money.
Took you and saved his family.
My daughtersuffered.
She suffered for years.
Enough.
Now it's yourturn.
Do you understand?
I will take my daughter and
leave this place.
From now on,
Sare will eat away yoursoul.
She will take you hostage.
This is your problem now.
My daughterwill be saved,
do you understand?
Enough.
You lived your life Ebru.
But now it's ourturn.
Me and my sister are going to live.
