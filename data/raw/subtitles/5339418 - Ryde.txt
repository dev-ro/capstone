[CELL PHONE RINGING]
Hello?
[WOMAN ON PHONE] Hi, baby, it's Casey.
I'm just calling to check up on you.
How are you feeling?
Um, I guess I'm feeling better
than a couple days ago,
but I just... I don't think
it's ever something
I'm gonna, you know, really get used to.
[CASEY] Yeah, I know what you mean.
I don't know how you do it.
Eh, I just do it day by day.
You know, if I did my job right,
it's a life saved versus a life lost.
[CASEY] Hmm.
Well, you're ready
for my birthday party tonight, right?
Yep.
Oh, hey, crap. I have to go.
I'm running really late
and I haven't even started getting ready yet.
[CASEY] Well, we know Marcus
is just gonna love that.
All right, I'll see you later.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING]
- Ha!
- Oh my God, Marcus.
I don't like it when you do that.
You scared me.
Then why do you tell me
to be here at a certain time
and you're not ready until hours later?
- Okay, 10 minutes.
- Mmm.
Ten minutes.
The longer you take,
the more I drink.
[SIGHS]
Whose is this?
[JASMINE] Whose is what?
The wallet.
[JASMINE] Oh. Um, I found it outside.
I was gonna try and return it.
All done.
- Thank you, baby.
- Yeah.
All right.
You know, I think I like the red
dress a little better on you.
Okay, well, I think I can not die
from your disapproval.
- I... [STAMMERS]
- [JASMINE SIGHS]
You look great.
You look great too.
Can we please just go have fun tonight?
Can we?
Hmm?
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Okay.
[HIP-HOP PLAYING]
¶ Big Daddy, show me why I wear the crown ¶
¶ I'll be good if you'll be nice ¶
Thank you.
- Well, let's go.
- Okay, I just need to get one thing.
- Whoa.
- ¶ Swing ¶
Can I please just do
one thing really quickly?
- Nope.
- Oh, babe.
- Nope.
- [LAUGHS]
All right. Will you grab my jacket?
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
¶ Swing, swing, swing it on me ¶
[WOMAN]
Yeah, I definitely want to go to Vegas.
My friend Alison, she just took off to Vegas.
She didn't tell anybody.
[MUFFLED DANCE MUSIC THUMPING]
[PATRONS CHATTERING]
I wish I can be like that...
so spontaneous,
just going off a whim.
It's exciting.
There's something romantic about it.
Don't you think?
[LAUGHS]
Man, I'm using my best...
my best stuff here.
It's so funny.
[LAUGHS] You are.
I'm glad you think so.
Is your girlfriend funny?
I don't have a girlfriend.
Not ever since I buried my wife.
Mmm.
No wonder you've been a bit distant.
Is it that obvious?
Um, well,
I just... I have
a good sense about people.
I'm really good at reading them.
- Really?
- Yeah.
But where would you
disappear to if you could?
LA.
[LAUGHS]
You're... you're already here.
Why LA?
I like the pace of it.
You know, everyone coming
and going, keeps it fresh.
I like that.
Well, who are you? Tell me more about you.
I'm an open book.
Well, I look forward to reading the pages.
I'm feeling adventurous.
Do you care to join me?
Vegas?
My place is a bit closer.
- Hey.
- What?
- Can you slow down?
- Come on.
Come on. We gotta get going.
All right, he's about one minute away, okay?
What?
- My Ryde car.
- Ryde car?
Ryde. It's an app.
It's like, um... a taxi,
just more comfortable.
- More comfortable?
- Yeah.
In a "my friend is giving us
a ride" type of way.
More comfort...
Yeah.
You've really never heard of it?
Don't worry about it. He has five R's up.
Meaning he's not going to kill us.
- Karl?
- Stephanie?
Hop in.
Hello.
You can just come in. Come on.
[LAUGHS]
- Hi.
- Hi, guys.
- How are you?
- Good.
Uh, so, guys, I'm Karl.
Help yourself to water and gum.
Let me know if y'all want
the AC or radio adjusted.
Uh, by the way,
I just dropped my new mix tape.
"Thunder," $5.99,
in case y'all want a copy.
Thank you.
I think we're good back here.

Hey, guys, uh... looks like we're here.
Oh, wow, that was fast.
Thank you so much.
Uh, if y'all enjoyed your ride tonight,
here's my card.
[STEPHANIE] Thank you. Appreciate it.
You can use my code to request me again.
No matter where I'm at in Los Angeles,
- I'll come to you.
- Thanks.
- How much do I owe you?
- [STEPHANIE] Are you coming?
Oh, it's all good, bro.
Everything's done through the app.
No more need for cash.
Tip?
It's not necessary.
Come on, really.
Thanks, man.
Well, why don't you pour us
a couple glasses of wine?
Come find me.
[STEPHANIE] Are you coming?
Yeah, I'll be right there.

[ELECTRICITY CRACKLES]
[KARL] Hey, long time.
So where are we off to?
I didn't get an address.
If you don't mind,
if I could just direct you?
- No problem.
- Great.
You having a good night so far?
Actually,
it's been a bit disappointing.
But the night's still young.
I could turn it around.
True.
So what do you do, for work, I mean?
I'm an EMT.
How long have you been doing this?
- This whole Ryde?
- It's been about a year,
a year and a half now, give or take.
That's a long time.
We're gonna make a right at the stop sign.
Pretty easy gig, huh?
Driving people around.
Definitely.
I make my own sched.
You don't have to check in with anyone?
Nope. Just start the app and drive.
Does anyone ever sit in the front seat?
All right time, but it's whatever
you're comfortable with.
You're not scared of a stranger
getting in the car with you?
Haven't had any problems yet.
So far, all my passengers
have been pretty harmless,
unless vomit worries you.
[PAUL] And make a right up here.
A lot of nice-looking ladies too.
That's a definite plus.
You must clean up.
Me? Uh...
No, I'm not exactly what
you'd call a ladies' man.
Girlfriend?
Not anymore.
Anymore?
It was pretty bad.
It's crazy how things don't work out.
She gets home on my birthday
and basically calls it quits.
Wasn't the birthday present
I was anticipating.
Happy belated birthday.
Thanks, man.
Yeah, if you can just, um,
just pull up right over here.
[TURN SIGNAL CLICKING]
Yeah, right here is perfect.
[KARL SIGHS]
Well, it's been fun.
Actually, if you don't mind
just waiting a little bit,
I'm gonna run upstairs,
grab some things for the night,
head back to my girl's place.
Absolutely, man. Take your time.
Thanks.

[KNOCKING]

Not at all.
[DISTANT SIREN WAILING]
[PAUL] Take the scenic route.
- I'll direct you.
- Definitely.
Just, um... just go
straight up all the way.
¶ ¶
You gotta tell me your secret.
Being myself?
That's not gonna work for me.
[PAUL] So how's it going
with the ladies? Any luck?
Not yet, but the night's still young.
Well, I figure after
all these rides are given,
bound to find a decent girl.
Here's hoping.
Ah, just keep refining your game, man.
A nice guy like you?
You'll be just fine.
Thanks.
[PAUL] I need a smoke.
Do you want me to pull over for a bit?
Yeah, if you don't mind.
Just, uh, right around
the bend here will be great.
Care to join me?
Why not?
Cigarette?
So much for trying to quit, right?
My mom always complains.
"These thing'll kill ya!"
[LIGHTER CLICKS]
Well, killing's better than dying.
What do you mean?
Killing's diminishing something...
to take the life away from it.
You decide when to take it.
You make the choice to see the ripples
of your decision that affect tomorrow.
Dying...
that's a whole different story.
You can't anticipate what you can't control.
That's deep, bro.
It's so serene up here.
That's why I like it.
All the isolation.
I can see my house from here.
Shall we?

Yamashiro?
[SIGHS] Yes.
For a much-needed nightcap.
Hi, Stefon?
Yeah, do you mind calling the DJ tomorrow
to remind them about the catering event?
Yeah, well, I still have to call
Charles about the catering
and then pick up the centerpieces.
Oh, yeah. You know, which reminds me,
I have to call Cheryl and tell her
that her speech has been bumped.
Oh, great. Yeah, okay.
Yeah, just do that. All right.
Okay, great. Thank you. Bye.
My staff just needs to get
their heads out of their own asses.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
Hello?
Yes. Yeah, I already spoke to Stefon.
Yeah, he's gonna call the DJ.
Don't even worry about it.
Yeah, of course.
Okay, yeah, so now
that I have you on the phone,
can you please call Cheryl
and tell her that she will
no longer be doing her speech?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know how she is.
Well, I would call her myself,
but I just don't want to.
Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay, great. So just do it.
That's why I'm asking you.
Okay. Okay, thank you.
Oh, you missed the turn.
Excuse me, you missed the turn.
I can't believe this.
I'm already running behind.
You can just make the U-turn up here.
Pull over!
Pull over, now!
Look, I just ended the...
I just ended the ride.
Can you just please stop the car?
What do you want? You want money?
What? You want some money?
Here, just take it.
Come on, please, just pull over the car.
I won't tell anybody.
I won't tell anybody!

Yeah, see, he's got it.
Hey, bro, hey, can you roll

You're totally fucking up my hair.
Pump some AC back here, all right?
Love, did you drive to me?
Yes.
Don't start with me.
Busy night?

Oh, we have a friend's birthday.
We're going to stop in for a drink
and then it's his turn.
His turn?
You like Jason's parties too.
Okay.
But Casey's my friend and it's her birthday,
so I would just like
to stay for a little while.
All right, J. But we can't stay all night,
or else we won't make it to Jason's.
No, it's fine, but it's her birthday.
I don't want to be rude.
I don't want to be rushed.

You're about to get a ticket.
You're parked in the red zone.
You're not allowed to park here,

- Ah.
I'm so sorry, sir.
I didn't even realize that.
I can just pull up a few feet,
get out of the red?
License and registration.
See, there they are there.
Those are my passengers.
Oh, you're a Ryde driver?
Yes, sir.
- How you doin'?
- Thank you.
Don't give our friend here a ticket.
I mean, it was our fault.
We made him wait.
Yeah, Officer. We were just
helping our friend.
I'll try not to.
All right, now, you guys gonna be okay?

Just make sure they get home safely, okay?
Absolutely, sir.
Have a good night.
Can you put that away, please? Thank you.

Okay, she's... she's
the one doing it. She's like...
Can you step out of the car for a second?
Yes, Officer.
Uh...
What seems to be the problem, Officer?
Your light's flickering.
Oh, yeah, that. It... it happens.
Well, pop the trunk.
It's usually a faulty connection.
I see it all the time. It's just loose.
But I can fix it.
Normally fixes on its own.
Oh, just pop the trunk anyway.
You don't want to get pulled over
twice in the same night, right?
Come on, so these girls can get home safely.
It'll just take a second.
Hey! It stopped flickering.
- I guess you were right.
- Told ya.
Happens all the time.
I'll fix it out ASAP.
Make sure you do.
She gonna be okay?

Oh, so much vodka.

Do you mind making an extra stop?
It's on the way.
Sure. What's the address?
Oh, I'll just tell you where to go.
Dude, like, you have to tell him.
Oh my God, you're right.
Just head up 6th and then
I'll tell you where to turn.
So, Karl,
where are you from?

but you're a bystander.
So you really don't know
what you're talking about.
Bystander?
Doesn't it make more sense
to hear my non-biased opinion?
You just seem like someone
that has a lot to offer,
besides your obvious beauty.
Thank you. That's... that's
very nice of you to say.
Everything okay?
Actually, you know what?
I think, um, I think I left
something back at the party.
Would you mind turning around, please?
What did you leave?
I, uh...
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Can you please pull over the car?
Can you please pull the car over?
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh God.
Oh, God, I feel like I'm gonna be sick.
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.
What are you doing?
- Hmm? I just...
- God, get off of me!

It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
I'm gonna go get the nurse, okay?
Okay.
Calm down. Just lay back. Just lay back.
[JASMINE MOANING]
You went through quite an ordeal.
[MARCUS] Just relax.
What happened?
Baby, you were in an accident.
You were in an accident, but you're okay.
You're okay.
Look here.
You and your baby are going to be just fine,
but you have to take it easy.
Sorry. Excuse me?
[MARCUS] Did you say baby?
Yup, baby.
[CASEY] Oh my God.
- [NURSE] Surprise.
- [MARCUS] What?
J? Did you know?
Baby? Baby, you're pregnant.
Baby, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, baby.
- No.
- I'm hoping you forgive me.
Please. Please forgive me.
I love you so much.
I love you so much.
I love you so much.
I'm sorry, baby.
It's gonna be our family, okay?
[NURSE] But you have a visitor.
And I don't think it can wait.
Miss Jasmine Baker?
Yes, that's me.
I'm Detective Ramirez.
I know this is a delicate time,
but we need you to come down
and identify the driver's body.
Right now?
Yes.
Jazzy, I'll go with you.
Hey, if you don't mind,
I'll take her.
Just breathe. You're okay.
- Yeah.
- You ready?
Yeah.
Please.
Oh my God.
Oh, no, no, no, I can't. I can't.
[MARCUS]
It's all right. Just breathe, okay?
It's all right, all right.
Take your time.
Just take your time.
That's not... that's not the driver.
I'm sorry, that's not the driver.
Baby, no more.
Karl Shafer?
This is the guy we pulled out
of the front seat of the car.
No, that's not him.
I mean, it kind of looks like him,
I guess, a little bit.
- You sure? You sure?
- I don't...
[RAMIREZ] Wait, wait, wait.
You hit your head pretty hard before.
Take your time.
Take another look.
This guy might be Karl.
But it's not him.
It's the wrong guy.
