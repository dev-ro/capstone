Follow me, Madame.
This is it, number 72.
Are you kidding?
-No. This is your suitcase, right?
Yes, but l booked a first class cabin
not a bunk in a dormitoy.
Common cabin, Madame
exclusively for ladies.
At least that's something.
-Sory, but we are not responsible.
The agency must be at fault.
You see.
Number 72, third deck. That's here.
But l paid for a first class ticket!
All l can do is cancel your ticket.
First class won't be available
till next week.
No thanks! l prefer the dormitoy.
-At your service. Have a nice trip.
Thanks...
-l had also booked first class.
Morons...
May l borrow a comb?
Of course.
Here you go.
See you later.
Because he doesn't know l'm coming.
l would like to telephone now.
Telephone?
Yes, to my husband.
And where is your husband?
-ln Hong Kong.
You may not know this, but we can't
phone from here. We send messages.
That's what l meant: Send a message.
-lt's not quite the same thing.
We must be at least 3 miles
from the coast.
lt requires special permission.
Marine code...
l've already been dumped on the
3rd deck instead of 1st class.
ls that Marine code, too?
-You in the dormitoy? Ludicrous!
Please, sit down.
-Thanks.
You should have asked for Igor.
l am Igor.
l can fix anyything here.
Tonight you can sleep in my cabin.
Thank you.
Where will you sleep?
ln a deckchair
or the Pasha's bath' tub.
Write down your message.
l'll take care of it right away.
Top prioritty.
Vey sensual handwriting.
What hands.
-Thank you.
Leave that, l'll do it.
Has it been long
since you last saw your husband?
Two months.
-That's a long time.
ls this also marine code?
Well, ifyou change your mind,
l'm in cabin 8, first deck.
Bitch...
Are you okay?
-No.
You're ill?
-No.
Here you go.
-No, l'm not thirstty.
What's wrong, then?
-This place scares me.
Excuse me, l can't hear you.
-l'm scared.
There is nothing to be afraid of.
-Yes, all these women.
Three women took me.
Do you understand?
No.
-l mean l was raped by three women.
Here?
-No, not here. In Macao.
l was at boarding school.
l was 16.
Still a virgin.
l had never come yet.
One evening, l was alone in
the reading room with three girls.
They were giggling.
Three Filipinas.
One held my arms,
another my face.
She French-kissed me... l wanted
to bite her, but l was scared.
l felt a hand inside my panties.
l hated it!
Then they all caressed me
at the same time.
l felt fingers inside me.
Strongly!
l came. This got
really trumped up at school.
From then on, when girls came to my
bed, l liked it. You understand?
Chang.
-Madame. We did not expect you.
Never mind. Where is Mr. Jean?
-On the veranda.
How soft your hands are,
my litttle Wong. Go on.
Oh, yes, Mr. Jean! l'll go on.
Does it feel good, Mr. Jean?
-Yes.
Oh, this feels good.
This is great.
Mrs. Jean!
Oh! What a handsome mustache.
But it tickles.
You asked me to grow it.
-That's true.
lt looks great, by the way.
-Really?
l didn't expect you
for another ten days.
lt has been almost ttwo months.
-Precisely sixtty-three days.
l got bored.
l took the first boat home.
You've had plentty of adventures?
-Lots.
Such as?
The adventures of a young,
single woman in Bangkok.
Wild ones?
Vey wild ones...
Coming?
Just as soon as Wong
has finished shaving me.
l'm going up.
-See you in a minute.
Wong...
Hi. It is vey dangerous if
the ventilator falls into the water.
Yes, l like bathing dangerously.
Oh... What are you doing here?
-l'm having a bath.
Sory, l forgot. Did you
get the presentations done?
No. Young miss here saved my life.
-Young miss is actually Emmanuelle.
Your wife!
-Yes.
Enchanted, Madame.
-Enchanted, Monsieur..?
Christopher.
-Christopher? Are you English?
Well, half and half...
-Back to your pool, Lindbergh.
So is it Christopher or Lindbergh?
-Lindbergh! He is an aviator.
Oh... Do you always sleep
with your propeller?
Yes. It's a beautiful love stoy.
l'll tell you about it.
Some other time, right?
-See you.
What is this aeroplane stoy?
-Nothing, he's just smuggling a bit.
Opium?
-No, antiques, l believe.
ls it dangerous
to let him stay here?
Not at all, don't wory.
Will he be staying long?
-No. A few days.
Fuck me.
Did you get dressed
for me to undress you?
No, l had a meeting,
which l have to cancel.
Hello?
Hello, Miss?
l have a meeting with Mr. Piang
in half an hour.
Would it be possible to
reschedule this to some other day?
Because, ah...
Because his wife hasn't
fucked him for ttwo months.
Are you nuts? Hello? No, it must be
an error. Someone else on the line!
Oh, he's off.
What a shame. Thanks.
What happened?
You don't want me to make love
to you for five minutes, do you?
And now Hong Kong
won't be thirstty anymore.
l hope you like the arrticle.
-Vey nice... you eKaggerate.
And now, l must leave you.
Thanks for the cigar.
Good bye, Madame.
-Bye, bye, see you soon.
How do l look? Not bad, eh?
Front page.
Not bad at all. But hadn't you
bettter shave the mustache?
No, should l?
Well, go on. French, you say...
Was she beautiful?
Rather... with splendid breasts
and a great body.
And you were the one who...
-No, she was the one.
She began by telling me some silly
rape stoy to excite me...
And this was in the dormitoy?
-Yes.
And no one saw you?
-Oh, yes.
We have looked for you
for three days.
You know my wife Emmanuelle?
Emmanuelle. Laura.
l had imagined you
Iooking vey differently.
Bettter or worse?
-Worse, of course.
Do you want a drink?
-No, someone is waiting for me.
l forgot to confirm
dinner at Peter's.
Oh, right...
Tomorrow... bring Emmanuelle.
-With pleasure, Madame.
See you tomorrow, then.
-Yes, tomorrow.
Who is this Peter?
-Peter is a man Laura lives with.
And Laura... Did you fuck her?
-Yes.
Was it good?
-Yes, great... in the water.
You mean in the tub?
-No, no, in the sea.
The sea...
Like fishes?
-Yes, just like fishes.
ls it difficult?
-Vey.
And you both came under water?
Yes.
Look at me.
Look...
Come.
Come.
l love you.
-So do l.
Breakfast!
Finish it all, do you hear?
Madame says you have lost weight.
What is all that?
-Porridge, bacon and eggs.
Toast with honey,
passion fruits...
Food for busy frogmen.
Time for irony, now?
-Don't think l'm jealous.
But it seems to me
your mermaid gets the whole sea...
While l only get
the showers and the tub.
Speaking ofthe mermaid, remember
we are invited to Peter's tonight.
Peter who?
-The mermaid's... Laura's friend.
Has Laura ever done this to you?
-No.
l'd rather stay here...
-So would l, but it's too late now.
Peter works for UNESCO.
His parrties are usually quite good.
Please join me.
Put on the litttle blue dress.
But isn't it a litttle too sexy?
Oh, l can't. It's still in my trunk.
You can ask Wong to take you
into town to buy a dress.
Why don't l ask Christopher instead?
Why not?
He's into that sorrt ofthing.
They are vey beautiful.
-Yes.
You really like Asian women.
-Jean told you.
l know eveyrything about you.
Even where you spend your nights.
At a place of ill repute
called the Emerald Garden.
The Jade Garden.
-The Jade Garden...
l also know
that white women scare you.
No, l just like yellow women bettter.
My best friend tells his wife all...
l thought he could keep a secret.
We tell each other eveyrything.
-lt's different with a woman.
l don't mind that you are a man,
quite the opposite.
l find you sexy, my good
Christopher... Quite sexy!
Don't be ridiculous! Sexy, me?
-Yes.
You have a nice smile, good teeth,
a big nose indicating virilitty.
Just as your neck, by the way,
strong shoulders... All vey sexy.
Do you think l'm sexy?
-Watch it, mate!
Good morning.
What's that for?
This is not for you! Good for
vey old Chinese gentlemen.
l have something for you, wait.
This is for beautiful ladies
like you! Ty it.
That's for my hair?
-lt's for the hairs on her ass.
Mind your own business.
No. Vey good.
Vey good. Magic!
Give me your hand.
Beautiful hands.
Feel good? You like? Really good?
Let's go! This is a joke shop...
How about the good magic, then?
Feel good? Okay?
-lt tickles.
OK, we'll take your stuff.
Beautiful lady,
ty acupuncture for happiness.
But l am already happy!
-No, this is special.
For women only.
First floor.
Come with me.
It's on the first floor.
OK?
-OK.
Come.
Come on!
l'm scared!
-We can still leave...
l like being scared.
Fantastic, isn't it?
Aquatic.
Just like litttle fishes.
Jean told me.
So?
-l hear you swim well.
So does Jean.
l know.
And he has great taste, too.
You are lovely.
-Thank you.
Bastard! Why did you tell her?
-l tell her eveyrything.
And she's notjealous?
-She's intelligent.
lt was wonderful!
-l knew you would enjoy it.
My daughter promised to join in.
But as usual, she let me down.
ls she the one, over there?
Yes, that litttle idiot over there
Anna Maria.
You have a lovely house.
-And you are a lovely girl.
Thank you.
Excuse me, please.
Good evening.
l hear you refused to dance tonight?
Yes. My father is furious.
He'll get over it.
How would you like to show off
yourself in front ofthe tourists?
lf l danced this well, why not?
lt's vey easy. You only need
ttwo fans and a vey good teacher.
Come visit the school, ifyou like.
-l'd love to.
Did you enjoy the show?
-Vey much so.
They made lots of mistakes.
You are to remain at our disposal.
-Of course.
Morning. Can l do something for you?
-You're vey kind. Thank you, no.
Something wrong?
-Nothing at all. Good bye.
What did the policeman want?
-He grilled me over my stupid visa.
The police has been vey interested
in you these past weeks.
A policeman came by the office
to enquire about you.
What did you tell him?
l vouched for you.
-Nice.
Well, you know l'm a boy scout.
l hope it's nothing serious.
Nothing whatsoever.
-lsn't that my shirrt?
How careless of me. l'm sory.
-Ruined... A dead shirrt. Keep it.
Oh, come on...
You want a beer?
-Yes, please.
Thanks.
You caress it like a woman.
-That's funny!
Tang Ling at the Jade Garden says
l caress her like a propeller.
By the way, regarding
the ttwo visitors we just had...
Can l stay a litttle longer?
Would four days be OK?
Are you kidding?
ls Emmanuelle OK?
-Yes, she's fine.
lt must be the special acupuncture.
She'll go back to that pharmacy.
Yes, if she likes it...
-Apparently, she loved it.
Doesn't it bother you that an old
man makes her come with needles?
Emmanuelle does whatever she likes.
-What ifyou see someone jump her?
First of all, no one ''jumps her''.
-What do you call it, then?
She makes her choices.
-Cheap talk!
Listen
l have no claim on 'Emmanuelle.
She is free to do
whatever she wants. So am l.
You're both vey strange.
All too much for you, right?
You'll never get it into your head.
Sory, Madam, one mustn't disturb
the students during their lesson.
You have to wait in the study.
-See you in a litttle while.
OK, that's it.
l'm sory about that.
Naim is often rude to visitors.
Will you still join the course?
-Maybe.
You think he is handsome.
-Yes, vey handsome.
ls he your boyyfriend?
-Not at all.
All the girls have a crush on him,
except for me.
Do you have a boyyfriend, already?
-Yes, Sam. He adores me!
Let's talk about him over tea.
-All right.
lmagine all the efforrt that a boy
must put into it... continuously.
Eyes locked in eyes, hearrtbeat.
All that to get his hand
into a girl's panties.
lt's all they ever think about.
But that goes for us too, right?
l kept wondering
how they would proceed.
That did something to me.
Was Jean your first love?
Yes he was, but he was not
the first one l made love with.
The first one was a boy.
All his jackets were
too big for him. He was so cute.
He was so shy.
l told him it was great.
Did you stay with him for long?
-No.
l just did it to lose my virginitty.
Then l waited 6 months. The next one
made me come for the first time.
Do you want to come home with me?
-No, l'm a bit tired. Next time.
You are not taking it furrther
with Sam? Then what do you do?
We kiss.
-That's all?
What about him
doesn't he want to take it' furrther?
No.
You're a liar. There is no Sam.
No.
l'm stupid, l'm making up boys
and stupid dreams.
While you touch yourself?
-No...
Well, yes... sometimes.
Phone call for your husband.
-But he's playing.
Hello, beautiful!
-Hello, Jean.
ls Laura there?
-Yes.
You love Laura, don't you?
-No. What makes you think that?
Nothing. l like Emmanuelle.
But there is something
about her and you l can't accept.
You are playing with love.
lfyou call sleeping with whomever
we chose playing, then you're right.
That is dangerous, isn't it?
-No. Not sleeping with anyone is.
l'll tell you something: l don't
Iove Laura, l love Emmanuelle.
What ifyou fall in love some day?
lt's a risk l have to take, but l
Iove risks, and so does Emmanuelle.
She knows about Laura!
-Yes, l hide nothing from her.
lt's the only way to be a couple.
-l wouldn't know.
No lies even by omission.
l have no claim on Emmanuelle.
Her pleasure is my pleasure.
Are you flirrting?
Oh, shit...
This can't be true.
That's all l needed.
What's up?
-Have you heard about Nina?
No! Is she a singer?
-lt's a class 8 ttyphoon.
lt will be here in three days.
l always wondered why these
bitches are called women's names.
ls it serious for you?
-No, but l have to leave soon.
l've got ttwo days.
After that, l can't take off.
Where are you offto, this time?
-Australia.
Problems?
-No, l don't think so.
Doesn't this ttyphoon bother you?
-No. The station is fine.
An inspection tour is enough.
Well, some other time.
-l'm offto the airstrip. Ciao!
Don't forget your propeller!
-Thanks.
God, it's even hottter here
than outside.
Yes, the heat is unbearable.
l've slept all day. l couldn't even
hold a pencil in my hand.
Will you take us to the baths?
Great idea.
Are you coming?
-No, no you go. l can't budge.
Please, Anna-Maria... l'd like you
to come. For my sake.
Coming or not?
Which one are you taking?
-l don't know.
Any ofthem.
l have chosen one.
-Let Anna-Maria go first.
lt's her first time here.
Which one will it be?
That one, l believe.
The right one. Is that all right?
Of course.
ln fact, she's the one
l would have chosen.
Small wonder...
Satisfied?
l'm happy you're here.
Both ofyou.
So here you are. l've been
Iooking everywhere for you.
Surprise... l'm going with you.
-That's not possible.
l must work, you know.
It's not a pleasant place.
Well, l'm going with you.
-Don't be stubborn. So...
So nothing. Let's go.
-You know what?
l too have a surprise, a real one.
-What is it?
Go pack,
because tomorrow you and l...
Bali.
-Bali? That's wonderful!
Satisfied?
-Yes... l'll get offyour back. Ciao!
The bags are packed, Madame,
and here is your red dress.
l think l'll order
a white dress with red stripes.
Or maybe brown ones.
Wong, get my wig.
l have an idea.
Now you are a true
daughter ofthe sky.
You think so?
Now Madame is the pretttiest
Chinese girl in Hong-Kong.
Hello... Good evening.
ls Mr. Christopher in?
No, sir! Please hang on. Do you
know where Mr. Christopher is?
Hello? l don't know where he is.
-But it's vey urgent!
He must get in touch with Mr. Ming.
Ming, do you hear? But quickly.
Otherrwise, he... Just tell him
to contact Ming. Good night.
This is imporrtant. Are you sure you
don't know where Mr. Christopher is?
Maybe at the Jade Garden.
-Jade Garden... Is it far from here?
No, it's not vey far.
Now listen, you'll go there
and find Mr. Christopher.
You'll tell him
that Ming has called him. Mr. Ming.
Oh, no Madame
l can't go to the Jade G'arden.
But why?
-l'm scared...
May l go upstairs?
-No, you can't.
But my friend is inside!
-No, no.
You have to be with somebody
to go inside... Can l help you?
No, thanks, l can manage myself.
l'm looking for a date.
-She's looking for a date!
She's my sister!
Christopher!
What are you doing here
Iooking like a whore?
Ming telephoned.
-So?
Sory... You're to call him back.
He said it was extremely urgent.
Ming can go fuck himself.
Are you turned on by being here?
What on earrth is happening to you?
ls it this show of virilitty
that does this to you?
ls it forbidden to be turned on
as a woman? Is it for men only?
Here broads are paid to make
you come, not to get turned on!
Just broads to you! So women are
nothing but fucking machines to you.
You think that you despise them,
but you are really afraid ofthem.
She's with me.
Get out.
What's this?
-lt's what the girls are paid with.
You pay for your gymnastics
with casino chips!
Don't you think that's shabby?
-Are you done giving me hell?
Let's go home.
You know l'm leaving tomorrow.
Well, l'm staying.
l want to make love.
So do l.
Too late.
l really used to fancy you.
But l make love to whom l like
and when l like. Bye!
Well, isn't that
the immaculate virgin!
Why are you here at this hour?
-l don't get along with my father.
l've left home.
-Again? Bravo!
Are you leaving?
Please hand me that shirrt.
You are lucky l'm leaving.
l would have loved
making love to you.
You too?
-Yep! Me too.
Please thank Jean for the shirrt.
And Emmanuelle
for her lectures in moralitty.
She gave you moralitty lectures?
-Yes.
She's a true
professor of philosophy.
For the road.
Now, now...
You're not breaking down.
What are you afraid of?
Still of men?
You are 18, beautiful, splendid.
Amongst the toads, someday
a prince charming will turn up.
Bye, toots.
-Bye.
Oh, Emmanuelle...
-l didn't mean to wake you.
l had words with my dad.
l left home.
l didn't know where to go.
-You did well coming here.
You can always fill me in.
-What a funny dress...
Christopher has left.
-Yes, l know.
l'm unhappy.
lt'll be all right.
Tomorrow, we leave for Bali.
You're joining us.
Listen, Jean doesn't
sleep in tonight.
Do you want
to sleep with me?
No! l prefer staying here.
l promise. l am fine here.
Hello.
Why is Anna-Maria
sleeping in the drawing room?
She fell out with her father.
She preferred to stay here.
l'm beat...
She's joining us for the Bali trip.
You look well rested.
-Oh, yes.
Yesterday, l was at the Jade Garden.
l met Christopher.
Hasn't he left?
-Yes.
Did you sleep with him?
No.
So, what did you do?
What l did?
l slept with 3 guys.
-Really?
How was it? Good?
-l'll show you.
And did you get paid?
How much?
Vey handsomely.
Tell me... Go on.
This boy
who is always with Anna-Maria...
Who? Michael?
-Yes, Michael.
She seems to like him.
-Are you jealous of him?
Not at all, l just want her.
She turns me on.
What was that?
l'm saying
that Anna-Maria turns me on.
And do you think she likes you?
You're not answering.
-You might ask her.
What do you think about her eyes?
-Blue.
And her nose, her mouth?
Stop, l can't take it any more!
-Her legs, her breasts...
Stop it, l can't take it any more.
Are you quite sure? Come here, then.
-Coming.
Ye litttle tramps!
ls all you said really true?
-Not at all.
You are ugly,
l do not desire you.
l hate you.
-Likewise.
