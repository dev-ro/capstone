Good afternoon.
Well, hello there, young lady.
The little one with you?
Yeah, he's buried in there someplace.
It was long drive.
He's fast asleep.
Let me give you a key so you can unpack some.
Thank you.
You need any help?
Oh no, thank you.
I don't have much.
Okay.
If you need anything, just let me know.
You've got the number.
I do, Mr. Langtree.

All right, honey, I'm going to get some more boxes

Are you okay?
I don't feel right.
Well, why don't you lie down for a little bit

HARRIET NELSON: I thought my own
Hotpoint dishwasher was wonderful,
but this new one is the greatest ever.
It uses a new system of spotless cleansing,
two detergent washers,
plus a few drops of this special wetting agent
squirted automatically
into the second rinse water.
And do you know what this does?
It makes it impossible for water
to collect in drops like--
Cody. Why don't you go play outside, okay?
I'm about to scrub the floor.
Stay near the house where I can see you.

Are you sure?
So I thought maybe you
had come by the house for something.
No, no, probably a raccoon.
They climb all over the place.
Bunch of pests.
No, I don't think this was a raccoon.
My son said that he saw something
down by the pond.
He's not supposed to be at the pond.
I don't want him playing near there.
LAURA: Yes, I know.
I have, uh,
I've already told him to stay away from it.
I can set some traps from the raccoons.
Again, I really don't think it was a raccoon.
So I don't think that that would be helpful.
Oh, but I did manage to lock myself
out of the house
last night when I went to investigate and--
Wait, that's impossible.
The door doesn't lock on its own--
Well, then I guess it was stuck.
-Well, you need--
-Anyway.
I had to break the window on the door to get in.
So I'm so sorry.
We already fixed the sink.
We're not paying for that window.
You broke it.
Of course I will pay for the window.

Laura.
Laura!
I need that new DM40 on my desk in an hour.
The DM4's the most crucial form in the file.
Hey, Cody, how was your day?
-It was okay.
-Yeah?
Cody, have you been teasing those little girls?
No.
Are you sure?
Yes.
'Cause I can see them tattling
on you to a teacher.
Do you want to give me your side of the story
before I get a call tonight?
I didn't do anything.
All right,
I'll wait for the call.

Mrs. Langtree?
Oh, oh, hello.
I was just checking on the appliances.
-Really?
-MRS. LANGTREE: Yeah.
I don't think so.
I think you were snooping.
Did you find the drugs you were looking for?
You know, this is my house
so I can actually check on it anytime I want.
Not without my permission, you can't.
And if you'd like to validate that,
we can call the police.
The police?
Mm-hmm.
Is there something wrong with you?
Because I think there's something terribly wrong
going on in this house.
Well, when you figure it out,
will you give me a holler?
Because I would just love to know.
I want you out of this house.
You have 30 days.
Put it in writing!
Oh, I will.
30 days!

BOSS: I've had repeated complaints
about the DM40 being filed
incorrectly or incomplete,
not attaching your correspondence
to the proper files.
I'll try to get better at that.
It's extremely important that you maintain
proper maintenance of the files for the auditors.
We're graded on accuracy.
There're fines implemented
if we don't meet a certain standard.
I understand.
Laura, I have to ask you a personal question.
Have you been drinking?
(SCOFFS)
I know you have.
I can smell it.
We don't tolerate drinking on the job.
That's clearly stated in your employee handbook.
Yes, it is.
I know because I read it.
But I think that if you had my job,
you'd be drinking too.
You try leaving your family and your friends
and everything you've ever known
to move to this small town
in the middle of nowhere,
all by yourself,
simply because no one gave you any other choice.
Then talk to me about drinking on the job.
Laura, look.
Or maybe there's a company manual
on how to get rid of a monster.
And I'm not talking about my ex-husband
or my entire overwhelming situation.
No, I am talking about an actual monster
who comes into my house
in the middle of the night
and tries to drag my son out
and drown him in a pond out back.
I know you think I'm nuts.
No. I don't think that.
I think you need help.
I do not need help.
I have everything completely under control.
No, you don't.
There's no reason we can't help women like you.
There's a number there.
Call it, speak to a nurse or counselor.
Actually, I think you should keep this
because I don't want your help
and I don't want your miserable job.
Then go.
I'm gone, daddy-o.

And can I have another one of those?
No, no, no, please.
You, you don't buy me a drink.
Come on, I'm celebrating.
Oh, what are we celebrating?
I quit my job today.
I hated it so I quit it.
Atta girl!
I like your style.
I'll tell you what,
I'll get you that drink
if you come dance with me.
Oh.
Come on.
One dance.
(GENTLE MUSIC)
You know this song?
Mm-mm.
Yeah, well, it's old and forgotten.
Kinda like me.
But, you,
you are a pretty young thing
in a pretty little polka dot dress.
You look like an angel.
I mean like...
like I died and went to heaven.
I was an angel once
in a play at church.
My grandmother made me
the most beautiful angel wings.
I felt like I could fly in those wings.
A girl like you,
you don't need wings to fly.
No, I have a car.
Oh, well, that'll do.
That's pretty good.
So what are you going to do next, angel?
(SOFT MUSIC)
I don't know.
I don't know.
Hey, hey, hey. Don't cry.
Don't cry.
You're going to figure something out.
I just wish I could go somewhere else,
you know, somewhere new
and start fresh.
Just, just start over.
Then you go,
you dig out those pretty little wings of yours
and you fly, fly, fly.

OFFICER: How are you today, ma'am?
Officer, I came to pick up my son
and I can't find him anywhere.
Okay, okay.
It's all right, ma'am.
What's your son's name?
His name is Cody Butler.
He's a second grade student.
I'm afraid that my ex-husband
has taken him without my knowledge.
OFFICER: Okay, well, we're going to get
-to the bottom of this, okay?
-Okay.
OFFICER: Do you, do you have any identification?
For Cody?
OFFICER: No, ma'am, your identification.

Hi, Laura.
I'm Barb Schiff.
I'm a caseworker with the department.
I'm sorry it took me so long to get here.
How are you?
Where is Cody?
I went to school to pick him up
and he was not there.
No, he wasn't.
Where do you think he is?
Does his dad have him?
BARB: No, he doesn't.
How do you know?
Did you call him?
I didn't need to.
What do you mean?
Laura,
would you mind if we backed up a little bit?
I think I could be of more help if I
understood the details of Cody's accident.
I'm referring to the accident
last year in Arizona.
Oh.
Well, that was nothing.
He fell in the pool.
I wasn't there.
I had to go to the grocery store.
His father was watching him.
When I came home, Scott was
on the couch, watching the game
and I went into the kitchen
and I had this weird feeling like something wrong.
And I was standing at the sink
and I was looking out the window at the pool
and I thought I saw something in it.
When I went out to check,
I saw that it was him.
And then what happened?
Well, I dragged him out
and I performed CPR on him
until the paramedics came
and then they revived him
and he was completely okay.
Why?
Are you saying there's something wrong with him
because of what happened?
No, that is not what I'm saying.
(PHONE VIBRATING)
It's okay, Laura.
You're all right.
(EERIE MUSIC)
