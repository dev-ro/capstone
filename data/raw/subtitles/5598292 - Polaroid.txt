[Sarah] Hey, I found something.
It's my mom's old stuff.

Wow.

- [Linda] What is that?
- It's a camera.
[clanks]
[both laugh]
Look. Your mom.
I've never seen that one before.
[Sarah] Looks like
just before she died.
[Linda]
Maybe it's from the camera.
- Where'd she get it?
- [Sarah] City auction.
[Linda] Ah, cool.
She liked that kind of stuff.
[cell phone buzzing]
Um, Craig just liked my picture.
[keypad clicking]
Sorry, I told you to take one
of your own.
[Linda]
It's only lingerie, Sarah.
You show more on the beach.
Well then, let's take one.
For real?
But I want it to be special.
One of a kind. Something
only he'll have a copy of.
Okay. What have you got in mind?
We take it...

No, not yet.
Well, anyway,
thanks for covering for me.
- Oh.
- I got you something
from the yard sale I just hit.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
What is it?
[Bird] Oh, my god.
It's an SX-70.
Holy shit.
- You like it?
- [clanks]
- Tyler, where did you find this?
- [snickers]
Seriously, I've never seen one
of these before in real life.
[Bird] They don't even
make them anymore.
They made them for, like,
a couple of years in the '70s.
- Wow.
- This is the same camera
Ansel Adams
and Walker Evans used.
Whoa! They're...
Photographers.
[chuckles]
- Right. Oh, yeah, and...

Anyway, it comes with the film,
and there is a camera case

[Bird] This is so cool.
If you wanna make sure it works,
there's still a photo in it.
Oh, yeah.

Want me to take your picture?
No, thank you.
Once was quite enough for today.
Well, you can try it out

[Kasey] Good boy.
So, how's your mom?
She's still not talking to me.
So that's awesome.
Really?
Yeah, she told my brother
she's praying on it,
like that's gonna fix me.
Oh, I'm sorry. That sucks.
Hey, at least
on the bright side,
only a year and a half

Nope. Still doing Journalism

Are you coming

I don't know.
Come on, it's a weeknight.
And isn't it a costume thing?
Yeah.

when she was in Belize.

Please?
Besides, Connor will be there.
You know,
I don't wanna scandalize you,
but I saw him in a Speedo
at swim meet last week.
- A-plus.
- Oh, my god.
You don't even like guys.
Hey, a good butt's a good butt.
Well, now all I'm thinking about
is his butt.
Uh-huh, as you should be.
[laughs]
[Kasey] You know you like it.
Did you know people at school
are calling me "Scarf Girl"?
Maybe?
[Kasey] See, but that's why
you should come tonight.
Let people actually get
to know you.
Look, I don't even have
anything to wear.
No, I figured you'd be weird,
so I brought you something.

- It's... It's called an SX-70.
- Whoa.
It's a camera?

Yeah, it's a little old.
Oh, I'm not used

carrying these things around.
Where'd you get it?
I...
I work at this antique store.

Why am I here? Is my mom okay?
No, your mom's fine.
She's on her way.
[Bird] Okay, well then,
what's going on?
You worked with Tyler Drew
at the antique shop
on Darby Street, right?
Yeah, I work with him. Why?
[Sheriff Pembroke] When's the
last time you saw him?
Around six,
when I left the store.
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this, but, uh...
Tyler's dead.
What?
[chuckles]
No, I was... I was just
with him. He was fine.
[Sheriff Pembroke] Was he
having any problems with anyone?
Anybody who might
wanna hurt him?
No.
No, was that what happened?
What about the last time
you saw him?
Did he seem... nervous?
Agitated?
No, he seemed normal.
[Sheriff Pembroke] Okay.
If you remember anything...
give me a call.

You're Doug Fitcher's daughter?
Um... yeah.

What?

I mean, two people we know
in one day?

I mean, Avery wasn't even
that drunk.
How would she fall like that?
What if she didn't?
What if something happened
to her?
Look.
See that thing
in the group photo?
The smudge?
It's not a smudge.
This exact same...
It looks like a smudge to me.
[Connor] Guys.
This shadow,
I saw the exact one last night,
before the party,
in Tyler's photo.
[scoffs]
What are you talking about?
[Bird] I took a photo of him.
With this.
Right before he died.
[Connor] And that shadow
was in the picture?
[Kasey] Wait. What?
I don't see a shadow.
No, that's exactly my point.
[Bird] After Tyler died,
the shadow moved
to Avery's photo.
And then when Avery died,
it moved again.
I... I think
you're all in danger.
Come on, Bird.
You should submit that shit
to Creepypasta.
[Devin snickers]
I think if it takes your photo,
you die.
- Huh?
- First, Tyler. Now, Avery?
[Bird] That means next
is one of you.
I don't know, maybe all of you.
It's not even a very good photo.
[scoffs]
It's not a magic camera, Bird.
I mean, if it really
freaks you out,
we can get rid
of the damn thing.
- [Connor] Devin.
- Wait, don't.

What do you mean you don't know?
This is your camera.
Yeah, it's not like this is in
the instruction manual, Devin.
[sighs heavily]
Let me see this thing.
- Wait.
- No, no, no. No one touches it
until we figure out
what's going on.
All right.
Excuse me.
Your girlfriend's out
of surgery now,
- if you'd like to see her.
- Yeah.
And, miss, don't go far.
Someone's gonna come here
for you in a few,
take a look at that scalp.
Figure this out, Bird.
Fix it.
[sighs]
Where did you even get this?
I don't know.
Tyler brought it in yesterday
from some yard sale.
Did it come in like a box
or anything?
Nope, just the film
and the case.
Well, where's the case?
[tense music]
[exhales deeply]
Are you sure you wanna do this?
I mean, if you want, I can go.
No, it's okay.
You're in the photo,
you should stay here.
Yeah, but who says the car
is any safer?
[sighs]
Well, look, if the police come,
it's better
that you're not in there.
Okay? Just...
Call me if you see
anything weird, all right?
Oh, we're way past weird.
Hey.

in the photo,
be careful.

[panting]
[gasps]
[panting]
I'm telling you,
she didn't kill herself.
- Okay?
- [officer 1] Look...
[Devin] You're not listening
to me.
Try to relax.
- What?
- I'll see what I can find out.
I'll be back in a couple
of minutes.
Okay.
- I'm so sorry.
- Save it.
You did this.
She's dead 'cause of you!
Devin, stop. It's not her fault.
Isn't it?
Who got the camera?
Who took the photo?
Huh?
Sorry.
[sobs]
[sobs]
[dramatic music]
[sobbing]
Are you okay?
[sniffles]
No.
[Bird coughs]
[sighs]
It was the heat of the moment.
He didn't mean any of it.
No, he's right.
[sniffles]
He's right, it is my fault.
It's always my fault.
[Bird sniffles]
What do you mean?
[Bird] My dad.
He was a reporter.
Worked for the town paper.
Anyway, this one night,
when I was 12, he was driving me
to a friend's house
for a sleepover.
And we get about halfway there,
and he says he wants
to take a detour
to show me something
he was working on.
But I just wanted to get
to the party.
I told him I didn't care.
So, he...
turned the car around, and...
[sniffles]
That's when we got hit.
[Bird] It's my fault.
Oh.
[sobs]
It's always my fault.
I'm so sorry.
[Bird] No.
No, I'm sorry.
[exhales heavily]
[cries]
I'm sorry.
I bet if he were here
right now,
he'd tell you
that this wasn't your fault.
No.
No. If he were here right now,
he'd be trying
to figure out the "why."
[tense music]
[suspenseful music]
[Bird] Grab anything between
October through December 1974.
[suspenseful music]
Got it.
[Bird] Oh, my god.
In 1974, three kids
were abducted,
and murdered in Locust Harbor.
"Roland Joseph Sable,
the man responsible
for the abduction and slaughter
of three teens
was a photography teacher...
at Locust Harbor High."
Roland Joseph Sable.
RJS.
This was his camera.
[Connor] And this is
what he used it for.
[Bird] He took their pictures.
"The suspect,
Roland Joseph Sable,
was shot and killed
before he could be taken
into custody."
[ominous music]
[Kasey] This is so messed up.
I mean, we shouldn't have to die
because we took
a stupid picture.
[thumps]
And I wanna know how you got
away from it, and Mina didn't.
I don't know, Devin.
[Bird] Now, would you sit down,
so we can figure this out?
Okay, so...
When it was coming after me,
it got near something hot,
and it did this, like,
weird blurry thing.
"Blurry thing"? What do you...
What do you mean?
When you develop photos,
you have to be careful,
because heat and light
can mess up the images.
What does that even mean?
Maybe this thing behaves
just like a photograph does.
Maybe it only develops
in the dark.
That's why it's not here now.
Look, we can't just wait
for this thing
to kill us off, okay?
Any one of us could be next.
Okay, look. I found this, guys.
[Kasey] Haunted photos.
Cameras capturing ghosts.
I mean, this stuff is real.
Yeah, but how is a shadow
in a photo coming after us?
Cursed objects.
Sometimes, things absorb energy
from their owners,
and with ghosts,
it's always that they have
unfinished business.
Look, this is his house.
Maybe someone named Sable
still lives there.
Yeah, let me check.
[sighs]
It says the house is owned
by an Anne Faraday as of 1977.
Shit.
- [objects clattering]
- [gasps]
We're wasting time, okay?
And if we don't figure
something out,
that thing's gonna
come back for us.
Hey, we don't even know
how this thing works.
I say we find out.
Devin, put the camera down.
- [Kasey] Stop.
- Don't touch me!
- [Kasey] Stop!
- Let go of me!
- Let go!
- [camera clicks]
[whirring]
[suspenseful music]
It was an accident.
- [Kasey] Guys?
- I'm sorry.
It's moving.
[ominous music]
[Connor] It changed the order.
- [camera humming]
- Hey, hey, hey.
- [Kasey] Devin, don't.
- [Connor] Come on, come on.
- I'm not gonna be next.
- Come on.
Devin, stop. Stop. Put it down.
This is her fault.
Devin, put the camera
on the table, okay?
If it weren't for her,
Mina would still be here.
- That's not true, Devin.
- [Connor] Devin.
- It's her fault Mina is dead!
- [Kasey] No, it's not!
- [Connor] Devin, please put...
- [Kasey] Put it down!
This is your fault.
- [Kasey] Devin.
- [Devin] Let go!
[Connor] Devin, please, come on.
Devin, just put it down!
[screams, grunts]
[screaming in pain]
- What the hell?
- [Devin screaming]
[screaming continues]
[grunts]
[groans]
- [Devin] What did you do to me?
- I didn't...
- What did you do?
- Hey, hey, hey, Devin!
- What did you do to me?
- [Connor] Hey, hey, calm down.
- What did you do?
- [officer 2] Hey, son.
- Is everything all right?
- [grunts]
Oh.
[siren wailing]
[Bird] You don't understand.
He's in danger.
He's in danger of
getting charged with a felony.
Oh, come on, man.
His girlfriend just died.
He's not exactly in his...
That doesn't mean he can haul
off and smack one of my guys.
Listen, we took a photo of him,
and now this...
thing inside the camera
is gonna come here...
"Thing inside the camera"?
I know how it sounds.
But this camera belonged
to a serial killer,
and now it's killing
our friends.
Okay, look,
I know this has been...
I understand this
has been hard on you.
Avery's accident,
Mina's suicide, Tyler...
It wasn't an accident
or a suicide.
And I get that sometimes,
to deal
with tragedies like this,
we make up stories.
- Urban legends.
- Right.
Except this wasn't
an urban legend.
This guy was real.
[Bird] He lived in this town
40 years ago,
and his name
was Roland Joseph Sable.
Look, I want you
to listen to me.
Now, he's come back,
we have his camera,
and... somehow, it's helping him
continue this murder spree...
- You gotta stop this, now.
- Look, this is his house, okay?
If we could just go there...
[shouts]
Listen to me!
Okay, if I get one peep
about you
going anywhere near
that house...
your friend in there
is gonna have a new roommate.
[radio chatter]
[Sheriff Pembroke] Now,
I'll give you a minute with him.
But then, I want you to go home.
Leave all this alone.
This is police business.
[Connor] This is such bullshit.
[door buzzes]
[Bird] How's your hand?
[Devin] It hurts.
I'm sorry...
about what I said.
[Devin] I know Mina
wasn't your fault.
But maybe me being next,
will buy you guys the time
you need...
to stop it.
[dramatic music]
[car door opens]
[cell phone ringing]
Oh, it's Kasey.
Please tell me you found
an old neighbor or something.
[Kasey] No, I did one better.
- Really?
- Yeah, well, it turns out
Anne Faraday didn't buy
the house in '77.
[Kasey] She just changed
the name on the deed.
Her real name is Lena Sable.
She's Roland's wife.
You guys should go check out
the house.
I'll stay here and keep diggin.
[tense music]
[tense music continues]
[knocking on door]
[Lena] Can I help you?
Hey, yeah, um...
Mrs. Sable?
There is no one here
by that name.
Wait, please.
I have your husband's camera.
[door creaking]
Look, I know you changed
your name, okay?
But you were
Mrs. Roland Joseph Sable, right?
[Bird] And this was his camera?
No.
Well...
I mean,
it has his initials on it.
Look.
RJS.
Rebecca Jane.
Our daughter.
[electricity crackles]
What's going on out there?
[electricity crackles]
[eerie music]
[rustling]
[panting]
[entity wheezing]
[door bangs]
[metal bars clattering]
[ominous music]
[panting]
[hissing]
[entity wheezing]
[Devin screams]
[slashing, clattering]
[thuds]
[clattering]
[door clicks]
[floorboard creaking]
[keys jangling]
This is her?
She's pretty.
She was.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
[Bird] Um, what happened to her?
[Lena] That is the part
of the story
no one ever talks about.
See, just because
she was pretty,
didn't mean she was
without issues.
Rebecca, bless her soul,
was slow.
Lived in her own world.
The only thing that seemed
to bring her out of it
was that camera.
- [camera clicks]
- After we gave it to her,
she became attached to it.
Took it everywhere with her.
[boy 1] Hey, camera girl!
You wanna take some pictures?
[Lena] The kids at school
started to tease her for it.
But, what started
as harmless whispers,
somehow got out of hand.
One night, four kids
tricked her into coming out.
Poor Rebecca had no idea.
[laughter]
[Lena] They took her most
prized possession,
and turned it against her.
They took horrible photos
no parent should ever
have to see.
[camera clicking]
[Lena] The next day, they passed
the photos around the school.
Humiliated her.
The embarrassment
was too much to bear.
She... She couldn't handle it.
We were both devastated.
And then, Roland saw the photo.
He became obsessed
with that camera,
with punishing those four kids
for their cruelty.
He wanted to make them suffer.
And he did.
[screams]
[Lena] My husband sought
a father's vengeance.
- [camera clicks]
- [cries]
[Lena] His anger turned him
into a killer.
Then they caught up with him
down at the dark room
at the school.
[gunshots]
[electricity crackling]
[eerie music]
- [Lena] He died...
- [camera humming]
...holding that camera.
The police confiscated
all the pictures,
but I held on to this one.
Roland told me he wouldn't stop
until they were all punished.
[electricity crackling]
He never got to finish
what he started.
Oh, my god.
[foreboding music]
One of them got away.
Bird, we have to go now.
[Connor] Bird.
Come on. It's... It's Devin.
We have to go now.
Now.
[electricity crackling]
[foreboding music]
[Kasey] So, if Devin's dead,
then we're next.
I know. Look, Kasey,
you gotta come meet us
at school, all right?
- [Kasey] Yeah, heading over now.
- Okay. Bye.
Wait. Are you sure about this?
[Bird] Yeah.
I think I know how to fix this.
[lock clicks]
[foreboding music]
[drawers clanking]
[Bird] Got it.
[light switch clicks]
[foreboding music]
No.
[rustling]
[Kasey] Hello.
Bird?
Connor?
- [flashlight clicking]
- [Kasey] No! Come on.
[gasping]
Guys?
[screams]
[sighs heavily]
Holy shit.
[Bird] Sheriff Pembroke.
[ominous music]
- [metal clangs]
- [both gasp]
[exhales sharply]
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
I'm the police.
And you're all breaking
and entering.
[handcuff clinking]
You followed us.
You know
that we're right about...
I followed you
because you've been taking
this haunted camera thing
too far.
Bothering the Sable woman...
Oh, you're really concerned
that we're bothering her?
Or maybe...
you're afraid
of what she told us.
Did she tell you
that I bullied her daughter
until she killed herself?
You're the one that got away.
[camera humming]
[Sheriff Pembroke]
Put that thing down.
I said put it down.
Bird, listen to me.
Put that thing away.
[gasps]
Connor, I can't do it.
Give it to me.
- Put it down.
- The only way he'll stop
- is if he gets the fourth.
- [Sheriff Pembroke] Put it away.
- [shutter clicks]
- Shut it off!
[camera clatters]
I'm sorry.
[Bird] I really am.
I know it was
a long time ago, but...
our friends are all dying
because of what you did.
Oh, Jesus, you got it all wrong.
We tried to get her away
from him.
[Sheriff Pembroke] We didn't
take those photos of Rebecca.
[camera clicks]
[Sheriff Pembroke]
Her father did.
We tried to get the pictures,
so we could take them
to the police.
But he found out and snapped.
- [Rebecca screams]
- [Sheriff Pembroke] Went crazy,
came after us,
killed us one by one,
to make sure his secret
never came out.
[screaming]
He took pleasure
in our suffering.
Thank god the police got there
before he could kill me.
But Rebecca...
couldn't live with the guilt.
That's why she hung herself.
Check the dates.
Rebecca killed herself
after the murders.
Rebecca was my friend.
We were all her friends.
Lena Sable told us...
Lena Sable stood by
while all this happened.
Of course, she's gonna
concoct some batshit story.
She's been blaming me
and my friends ever since.
[light switch shuts]
[camera humming]
[gasps]
He's coming.
[eerie music]
[gasping]
Behind you.
[disembodied whispers]

You'll be safe here

[gasps]
[Bird yelps]
- [muffled grunt]
- [Connor shushing]
[Bird whimpers]
[Connor panting]
[Connor] We can't stop it.
Look, he's still there.
Once it takes your picture,
it uses it against you.
Wait.
What?
Connor, we have to get
the camera.
We have to take it some place
where that thing
is gonna be fully formed.
- [Connor] Come on. Let's go.
- [Bird] Okay. Go.
Okay, okay. Quick.

Is it over?

He's gone.
- [Connor] He's gone.
- [Kasey] Guys?
We should sit down.
[Connor] Easy, easy.
[groans]
I'm never doing
another stupid photo bomb.
[all chuckle]
You should take her
to the hospital.
[Connor] Hey.
What about you?
- [Connor] You're hurt.
- I know.
There's something
I have to do first.
