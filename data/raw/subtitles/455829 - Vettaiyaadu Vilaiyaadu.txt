Sir, Raghavan has become
thorn in the flesh.
He brushed aside all ourthreats.
What? Using him?
l don't want to listen !
l can't wait any longer.
Who does he think he is? Narcotics?
Why is he interfering?-You go.
He's been messing with me forthe past ten years,
even though he knows who l am.
Proud of being a policeman.- Dear?
You go ahead. l'll come.
l don't want to hear any of that.
Listen to me. l want his eye.
l want DCP Raghavans left eye.
5 lacs forthe guy brings it to me.
Spot Payment.
Announce it. Let's see who has the guts.
Hey, Raghavan is here!
Boss! Boss!
What?-Where is he?
Tell him DCP Raghavan is here.
What is it sir?
Nothing Mani. l heard you asked for my eye.
- l didn't ask for it, sir.
l heard you priced it at 5 Lacs
for whoever brings it??
Why spend unnecessarily? Here l am.
Take my eye do it that is if you're a man!
Word is that, you said l'm a big problem,
l won't listen to you even after all the warnings,
so, you want my eye .
Are you trying to say that
you are not Rayapuram Mani?
Raghavan...Don't...
lt's between you and me, an old stand off!
forthe last ten years, right?
Lets finish it now.
That's why l am here.
lf you let me out of here alive and
with my sight intact,
let me tell you in front of your men,
you'll be just be plain 'Mani'.
Your smuggling, ganja, heroin,
illegal activities etc. l'll end it all.
Even deciding to retire and stay home
with yourfamily wont work
because you'll be in jail counting bars,
but then again,
you don't know any Maths
what the hell will you count?
You think l'm talking big
because of my uniform?
But l haven't come in uniform,
l am not on duty and l haven't come with back up.
l'm here all by myself. So how about it?
just you and me, man to man?
Shut the gate! Fucker! Shut the gate.
Here boss!
Good.
Stop all your nefarious activities.
Come to the Commissioner's office tomorrow.
Come at 10.00. Don't come too early,
l'll take your statement personally.
All of you find other jobs.
Shut the gate.
l'm in too deep Raghavan.
l don't know how to do anything else.
You're my only problem and l don't give a fuck!
Boys! hack him to death!

When bravery and honesty go hand in hand,
The dictionary would call it Raghavan
His character was never
demanding nor dominating.
And he resembled the tiger in his steps.
He was the one who held high respects
for his profession
And hearing that even the sky would
want to shake hands with him
When a wick is lit,
the flame that comes out is him.

He was as fast as he had a thousand eyes
and a thousand hands
But yet he was not god.
lf the sun goes missing from the sky,
he would even sell the sky to find it.
When his hands take action
for more man hunts
The easier it is to get his enemies,
And drench them in a pool of blood
with all the force
He burnt the word fear and threw it away.

No dad. This is the Trichy to Madurai
via Keeranur bus.
No, no. lts leaving now, in 2 minutes.
lt will reach Madurai at 8.30.
Ok. l'll come to the bus stand.
- No. l'll come home myself.
Thank you.
Rani... Hello Rani!
What? Don't you remember me?
Please don't cry.
l am very scared.
Where could she have gone?
lt's almost morning now.
She isn't at any of herfriends place either.
l...l...l...l'll take care of it.
The Department's there...
We'll find her...don't cry dear.
l'll come back with Rani, bye.
Shall l try calling the hostel again?
- Ok..Close the gate.
ljust boiled the milk..... What is this?
...Oh my god...What is it?...
You go inside.
Nothing...it's nothing!
l don't think she is alive.
- Sir. Please.
lt was tied to the threshold like an amulet
tied on wrist to ward off evil.
l recognized the mole,
that's Rani's finger.
How is it possible sir?
Wasn't there a security at the gate?
l sent them away.
Asked them not to come home
till they had news about Rani.
These are the complete reports ...
The finger was removed at 6.30.
That's what the report says.
Doctor says she was alive
when the finger was severed.
Who could it be?
- l don't know.
Here, look at this.
Someone who wants revenge.
Someone who wants to see you cry,
has done this. That's why l asked.
l'm confused, so l requested
you to come here.
l was a brave policeman,
didn't expect anything to happen.
l neverthought of having
a wife and daughter.
We feel the pain only
when our shoe pinches.
Think about it.
Think of a list of names.
People you don't like. People who don't like you.
Something might come up.
At ease. At ease.
When did you get here?
l was informed at 9 last night
and l took the Rockford.- Good
Just a few minutes before she boarded the bus,
Rani has spoken to Mr. Arokiaraj
from that STD booth.
Yes. l already told the Police that
she made that call from here.
l even gave them the receipt.
Was there anyone else with her?
- No..
Huh?
No. She was alone.
Sir?
How far is Rani's college from here?
- Quite close, about 4 Kms.
Did Rani have issues with anyone?
No. Sir. She's the quiet type.
She always hangs out with her set of friends.
Doesn't interact much with boys.
Havent you eaten? Here... eat this..
Learn to earn your living.
What?
l am a cop
- Bribe again? They just took it from me.
From you as well?
Good ! lts not about that.
A girl has been missing from this bus stand
forthe past two days.
Can you recognize this person
from the photograph?
Yeah. l saw her making a call
from that STD Booth.
l have seen her many times.
She was wearing a blue outfit.-When?
Day before yesterday.
-Was anyone else with her?
There was a guy talking to her and
there was a vehicle on the other side.
They left in that.
What kind of car?
Red colour. Maruti. Like a soap dish.
Flat and Long.
Flat and long? You mean a van?
- l don't know..
A van's door opens this way.
A car's opens this way.
Yes yes. That's the one.
van
van
Can you identify that guy?
He....wore jeans..like this.
He was turned away, couldn't see his face.
Which way did the van go?
- That....way...
ls this where you beg everyday?
- Huh? Me? l'm a land lord!
Who you?
Me!
May you live a hundred years.
Finger analysis...
...was done on Sunday at 4pm.
The finger was removed
approximately 22 hours earlier.
So.. that means 4... minus .... 22.... is 6pm.
She spoke to Mr. Arogyaraj at 5.30.
So everything happened in half an hour
between 5. 30 and 6.-Yes sir.
They couldn't have traveled more than
15 minutes from the bus stand.-Yes sir.
But sir...this is a straight road...
No deviations...one coming up now
is the first left.
Please stop the car. Back up...
That's enough.
What shop is that?
l think tender coconut seller's shop sir.
Ask them they saw a van pass by.
-Yes sir.
Sir, they saw a red Maruthi van.
lt passed by the day before yesterday
in the evening.
Usually vehicles don't turn this way,
that's why he noticed it.
Where does this road lead to?
lt leads nowhere, Sir. Just a banyan tree
and a forest beyond that.
Tire marks end here.
From here till there... hey... careful...
We'll stop as soon as
we feel strike some thing, sir.
lt's probably not a 'thing' it's a ...
Ok just be careful.
Hey.... Careful
Slowly
Be careful.
-Yes sir
What happened Raghavan?
Nothing... You could've waited at the station.
You needn't have come here.
Got anything? People are digging out.
That.... Just a hunch sir.
Nothing to worry....
Please wait at the station,
if something comes up l'll let you know...
One minute sir
Please wait here sir... l'll...
What happened?
Sir! l'm sorry! lt's Rani.
l don't think you should see...
please... come... Sir... please sir!
Sir!... Sir.. don't.. please Sir..
don't Sir..its evidence sir..no no..
But l'm a father damn it!
Sir, as a police man, you know ,Sir!...
You know it's evidence sir...
Please No... no...
Why my daughter?
l'm sorry sir.
Sir, excuse me.
Get a hold of him, lift him!
Come sir...Please....get a hold of him.
What happened? Rani....?
Rani will not come...
our Rani will not come...she's dead.
What? what?
Rani is dead!
You came all the way
just to dig up my daughter's body?
Where's is my daughter?
Sir...
Sir, Dr. Kamaraj.
l am Raghavan, deputy commissioner of Police,
crime branch....
On special deputation
l am in charge of this investigation.
So, you are in charge is it?
l've never seen such a gory murder in my life.
Mode of death - Slitting the throat...
-Weapon?
Surgical knife, and it's been done by
someone who knows how to use one.
Not only that, the body has been
bisected into two.
Ya l saw. lt was in two halves this morning.
She has also been raped
before she was murdered.
Semen traces?
He's removed the traces
to avoid DNA identification.
The time of murder is probably between 6 - 6:15
the day before yesterday. Excellent...
Can you hand overthe reports soon...
forthe investigation?
l will hand it over as soon as possible.
Raghavan..ljust remembered...
Two years ago, there were these guys
who misbehaved with Rani,
l bashed them up in a college function.
l detained them at the station
for a day and left them.
Could it be them? l don't know...
Anyway, ljust felt like telling you this.
Thank you sir.
Arokiaraj Sir wanted it to be confidential.
So we left them in his custody
in the station all night and we left.
We didn't collect any details about them.
They were from Madras.
Not students though.
They regretted their mistake and begged
and pleaded to be released.
Couple of useless chaps.
They wouldn't dare do such a thing!
Thank you
Yes Sir.
Sir, You'll have to be there for Chitra. Goodbye
Raghavan, We have to find him.
Not because this is about my Rani.
The guy who committed
such a gruesome murder
is still a free man somewhere out there.
l can't stand that. We should get him.
l'll get him sir. l mean, we'll get him sir.
We are leaving Raghvan.
We are going to New York.
Rani wanted to her MS there.
We planned to there with her.
But now only l and my wife are going.
l fear of losing Chitra too
if l stay back here.
Dosa is ready. Who wants the first?
Don't create a tiff in the family.
We can all share. Come dad.
Yeah
We shouldn't be eating mutton,
especially afterthe age of 40.
Sis, lets become vegetarians from next Sunday?
We eat meat only on Sundays, so its ok.
l'll answerthe phone.
Sure.Be polite!
Hello..Please wait. l'll call him. Uncle, it's foryou.
Hello. Raghavan here.
Sir. l'm sorry sir.
When did it happen?
l'll be there in half an hour sir.
ljust spoke to the
New York Police a while ago.
One Mr. Anderson,
he is the investigating officer.
He told me it was an execution.
There is a difference between
a murder and an execution right?
Arokiaraj was brutally beaten to death.
His wife's throat was slit.
l told Mr.Anderson about Rani's death.
He was shocked.
He has asked forthe case details.
l have promised to send it.
Whats going on Raghavan?
Six months ago it was their daughter,
now its them.
Awhole family has been destroyed.
There is a connection.
Rani's murder was in Keeranur.
This is in New York.
There is something crazy happening.
He has no relatives.
They were staying at his brother-in-law's place,
he passed away a year ago.
They don't have any family left here orthere.
They sold everything before they left.
We need to give him a decent burial.
Atleast l owe him this much.
Actually l owe him more.
l need to go there.
Please somehow work me into the case.
Sure. l have faxed them about your arrival.
A small introduction.
We need to know what exactly happened there
l have also mentioned your rights
to claim the bodies.
Thank you sir.
because Arokiaraj was a police officer
of outstanding caliber.
l've got Home Ministry approval also.
The New York Police have also asked for help.
You can carry all his case files.
But no gun. OK Raghavan?
Yeah l understand.
l've plenty of information on you.
About your honesty,
your impressive arrest record...
You're a rare breed
of upright policeman.
l've got you transfered to
Tirunelveli on a special request.
l've brought you to small town
from Chennai, any regrets?
Not at all sir.
As a matter of fact, Chennai was getting
a little too fast for me. l like Tirunelveli.
Mrs.Arokiaraj... the curry is amazing.
Nothing like Nellai cuisine.
Why? Don't you get this kind of food
at your place?
Yeah..But Mom's style is different.
That's a 'Mother's ' touch!.
Now you have a beautiful wife,
why don't you ask herto make it foryou?
Who....? Her...?
Bread, Pizza, Lasagna, Macaroni...
l can't figure out if she is cursing me
or narrating the menu.
She doesn't know anything else,
l meant only in regards to cooking.
Why? Don't you like all that?
Food is his weakness... and now me!
Did you hearthat?
How beautifully she said that?
What do you say?
You were the talking point
of our discussion.
Did you tell them? What?
That you are crazy about me.
You've told everyone..
Why won't you tell me?
Do l have to? Don't you already know?
Team ForCe
Ever since l saw you the first time,
Everything seems to be like an illusion...
You reached like a wave and
pulled me like a sea.
And yourface has become the
logo of my life!
Your eyes say it all...
And l can see the love flowing
through your eyes!
l lived my life by seeing the
love in your eyes
And l got drenched in the uniqueness of
your love and l too became rain
Team ForCe
The first thing my eyes search for when
l wake up in the morning is you.
And the last thing my eyes will see
before l sleep is you
The adore the way you know the things
l do not know about myself
And l am trying my level best to fulfill
your wishes without asking what they are!
You would say it a million times
and nevertake leave
And l would force you to do so
and watch you move away...
And l would be at the door, smiling.
Your eyes says it all
And l can see the love flowing
through your eyes!
You reached like a wave and
pulled me like a sea.
And l got drenched in the uniqueness of
your love and l too became rain
Team ForCe

And l could see you dreaming
the way l was admiring you...
l want to build a house far away from
civilization for just you and me,
And l want to etch the lives
we lived on all the trees
You are the only girl, whom l struggle
to talk to when l look into your eyes
And you are the only one l can go
on admiring without blinking my eyes.
Ever since l saw you the first time,
Everything seems to be like an illusion...
You reached like a wave and
pulled me like a sea.
And yourface has become
the logo of my life!
Hey.... Who are you? Let go... let go....
Hey... Go ahead and shoot now.
Raghavan...
l tried driving as fast as l could ,
but she died before l could get here...
she died in my lap.
Why? Why sir? Why me?
Kayal...
Sir, jewels
We could go with a whole task force
or it can just be you and me.
Retribution for Kayal's sake.
ls it the place?
Did Dharma called us to this place?
Hey...where are you going away?
Please forgive us sir.
Boss! - Stop man.
What the hell happened to both of you?
Oh! ls it your handiwork?
Haven't you yet mellowed?
Raghavan, you don't know about me.
l know about you ! and
also what your mom does for living!
lt's was between you and me?
Why did you kill Kayalvizhi you Asshole!
Raghavan
Aradhna
Why?
Your question sounds like dialogue
from a Mani Ratnam film. 'Why'?
Yes! Why?
l don't know. Stupid right?
Actually, just forthe heck of it !
Wanted to see what would happen.
l could've taken off the cover easily.
Just wanted to see how far l dared to go...
l saw it in a Ben Kingsley film.
Can't rememberthe name ... but he dies though.
Please don't try this again.
Get the door repaired in the morning.
Sleep well. Good night.
l'm looking for detective Anderson,
l think he's expecting me. l'm..
Raghavan? From lndia? Police officer?
Straight up the stairs.
Mr. Anderson?
Right that way.
Thanks.
Mr. Anderson?
Raghavan right? How was ourtrip?
Excellent
Can l see theirfaces please?
- Sure.
Thank.. Thank you.
Raghavan, we found this underthe stairs.
Forensics show soap and sweat stains
and blood there. Arokiaraj's l think.
We're looking for an lndian.
These pictures were taken an hour
after we got to the scene of the crime.
You're ok?
Ya, l'm ok.
Oh l'm sorry. l know this guy Raviraj
meant a lot to you.
This is it. This is where he and his wife lived.
The house belonged to a relative of her's.
What happened here was an execution.
First point of entry was upstairs
on the other side of the house.
He must've heard something
and came down the stairs.
He was standing right here
when he was struck forthe first time.
Knocked forward into the door.
You see the splatter?
falls to the ground, no time to react.
perpetrators hit him repeatedly
with the baseball bat,
and at some point Arokiaraj pulls the
Rudraksha chain around the killer's neck.
We found him here.
Death wasn't instantaneous.
Because it wasn't meant to be.
Body numbertwo. Upstairs.
Arokiaraj's wife Chitra.
He finished off Arokiaraj
and then came up here.
walked through the door and slit herthroat.
So we found a license for a (walter PPK),
but we didn't find it on the premises.
He broke through the fence to get in.
Come on, l'll show you.
Found about half a dozen cigarette butts
on the floor here.
Looks like he was definitely
watching the house.
Planned murder and execution.
Hello.
How are you?
l'm good.
Have you shifted your room?
No.. why?
lsn't that your room?
Ya... God.
Rani was murdered in Tamil Nadu.
Mr and Mrs Arokiaraj were murdered
in New Jersey, New York.
lt's possible that both murders were
committed by the same person.
So, did he come from Tamil Nadu to America
orfrom America to Keeranur?
Seems like both the murders were
committed by the same person.
The clues differ and the modus operandi differs.
For example, Rani was buried
but Mr and Mrs Arokiaraj were not.
Why?
l'll get this guy! Your gonna be caught , man!
Hi.
Hello. Have you had breakfast?
No, l'm about to. Nothing is good here.
very American. They only serve bread
Then?
There's an lndian Caf?across the street.
l'm going there...
Oh... l'm also
Come along....
No... l meant l was also planning to go there.
Oh....
Shall we?
Sure
Me? Software? l'm a cop.
Hardware! DCP Crimes, Chennai.
Oh....
Yup! Don't l look it?
l don't know. l've never met a cop before.
Neither here northere.
l don't know if that's a good thing
or a bad thing!
l'm going to get something to drink,
do you want something?
Yup. Orange juice.
How did you know?
Seriously, l've been thinking about it,
been meaning to ask you.
How did you know?
When l saw you in the corridor,
l realized you had been crying a lot...
yourface kept flashing in my mind,
as l was resting in my room.
l knew something was wrong. A hunch. lnstinct.
Wow. Awesome.
So, you're the 'Nostradamus' types.
Much worse. A Cop!
But what if l was doing something else,
like reading a book when you barged in?
What would you have done?
l would have been embarrassed.
l would've apologized and left!
That would have been hilarious ! l wish.
Seattle. The other coast. 5 hours by flight.
Life. Home.
lt was everything for me. 9 months ago.
Suddenly everything ended.
There was nothing left.
Shut up. Don't fucking bug me ok?
Why the fuck do l need to come home
at 10 huh? to do what?
l am with another woman ... its serious.
l want out...l can't stay here anymore,
l may go mad.
Who? ls it Sandhya?
Why did we build a life together?
What do l make of the past two years?
You know what all we went through?
lt was all going great, Arun.
l neverthought it could go bad.
What's wrong with you?
l was pretending, Aradhna.
l pretended to be in love with you.
l don't love you anymore. l'm crazy about her.
Were you pretending?
- Stop it...shit!
He said he has been pretending
all these years.
l couldn't handle that. lt's been 9 months.
l've been here for4 days.
l thought l'd find myself a job here.
Nothing worked out.
l cried a lot the day before yesterday...
after a long time. l hated it!
So, l thought l'd see if there was
anything beyond life.
l found a plastic cover...
that's when you entered.
You don't have to explain yourself.
ljust felt like telling you...
Oh then go ahead.
Not just that.
l feel like confiding in someone.
lt's been a while since l have,
besides you're a fellow Tamilian...
you saved my life too. Thanks.
l would have even if l was from Andhra!
When you thanked me, did you mean it?
Or would you rather have died?
Thanks
Raghavan, you are not going to believe this.
-What?
Come on. l got to show you something.
This is a file from a case in Princeton, New Jersey.
2 years ago, an lndian girl went missing.
She is still missing.
This is what the police there found.
A 23 year old medical student Chandana,
Herfinger was found hanging on the
rearview mirror of her boyfriend's car.
With the chillies and the lemon.
-Yeah
When you told me about Rani and how she died,
with herfinger in the doorway,
Yeah
l felt kind of strange about it.
And this morning, it struck me what it was.
So l called my friend in Princeton
and this is what he sent me.
Well, There you have it.
Hello, tell me Radhavan
We can be certain that the
murderer is from our country
He wears a Rudraksh around his neck.
He had been watching Mr.Arokiaraj
and his wife for a long time
before he planned to murdered them.
l am sure that there is
some connection between
this and the Keeranur murder
that happened 9 months ago.
Someone has taken revenge.
They have wiped out an entire family.
We still have to figure out if he is from
around here or if he came from lndia.
Another bizarre bit of information,
There was a finger hanging outside
Arokiraj's residence in Madurai, right?
Similarly they found anotherfinger here,
hanging in a car's rearview mirror.
That of a girl's, the same talisman,
chillies and a lemon in between,
just like the one in Trichy.
Raghavan. use the landline.
- No. lt's ok.
You sure?
-Yeah. Sorry sir.
This girl was also lndian.
The case is still open.
She's still missing. The hanging finger
is similarto Rani's case.
Details of whom she was last seen with,
where she lived,
which road she was last seen
on is all available here.
Yeah. l am going to check it out sir.
l am going to see if l can find a
dead body here like the one in Keeranur.
We must find him.
l'm not seeking revenge
for my Rani's death.
Killed a girl so barbarously
l couldn't bearto see
the mangled body.
We should get him.
l want you to sign!
l don't need your money.
l don't want your money!
What do you think?
That l am dependent on you?
l told you that l am not interested.
Sign here.
Don't! lf you touch me again, l'll call 911!
Do you want me to do that Arun?
Sign it. And then its over.
So you live happily is it? l wont sign it.
Take a walk. Get out.
What's happening here?
What is it to you, man? Who are you?
Me? l am staying next door.
l can't stand the noise!.
l will have to report it to the management.
Dude! Who the hell are you?
You can go and complain
anywhere you want!
l will make noise! lf it bothers you,
move into a 5 star hotel!
Arun! Please.
Mr. Raghavan .. its nothing! Please leave!
Are you all right?
-Yeah
Hey. You've hit her.
Didn't they everteach you neverto
raise your hand against a woman?
You...
Leave him alone. Leave him Arun!
You've found someone else so soon huh?
Hey hey hey!
l don't know who she is.
My name is Raghavan.
Deputy Commissioner of Police, Chennai.
l stay next door. l heard something.
l came here and saw that you had hit her.
lf you hadn't hit her,
l wouldn't have interfered.
But you have.
l hate violence against women,
even if it isn't my jurisdiction.
So l have invited myself to this party my friend.
You shouldn't touch her. That's all l want.
What's happening here?
Do you think your watching a show or something?
Arun, get out.
Leave the papers here.
l'll sign them and have it you.
lsn't that all you want?
l'm sorry Aradhna.
l don't think l should have interfered this evening.
When l saw that he had hit you,
l lost my temper and over reacted.
No. its ok. lts all good. Thank you actually.
Still, he shouldn't have hit you. That's not done.
This is yourfirst time in America, isn't it?-Yes.
For me too. l mean in New York.
l've heard that Times Square
is always this way.
People...Lots of people.
Lots of Cars. lt's like this all night.
Just like Bombay. Nice, isn't it ?
-Yeah.
What were you saying?
l was married.
You are
- l was. Past tense.
She passed away.
She was just 28. lt's been 8 years.
l am really sorry. l didn't know.
Don't misunderstand me.
No it's allright. lt's fine.
What was her name?
- Kayalvizhi (eyes like a fish)
That was just her name.
But, she had big, round eyes.
She was very beautiful.
Where did you meet her?
We met at a wedding.
lt was love at first sight !
l proposed to her immediately.
l love you!
lt's only been 2 hours since we met
and how can you be in love already?
l would have told you within 2 mins.
l didn't want you to misunderstand me,
so l waited for 2 hours.
Look. l am a police officer.
Don't think l am the strict, stiff,
reserved type, l talk a lot!
Actually, l am quite fun to be with!
l'll take very good care of you and our children!
This is too fast for me!
Look here Kayal.
This might seem too fast foryou.
But it's too slow for me.
lf you say 'No' then fine.
lf not today, then we can get married tomorrow!
What? What are you saying?
l am saying please marry me!
''Tomorrow isn't auspicious,
So get married the day after!''
is what her mother said.
we got married the day after!
What? She agreed? Then and there?
Someone might hear us.
Exactly. Before someone else
could propose, l did.
Will you...will you?
What? See, someone is already
coming between us... What?
l could see it in her eyes that she liked me too,
Which is why l dared to propose.
- Oh
Yeah... it's in the eyes,
you can always tell from the eyes,
Especially if your a Cop!
- Nice!
Kayal was 5 months pregnant when she died.
lt was too painful.
l became bitter.
l've never been that way,
l got mad at myself for being like that.
But..l feel a lot better after confiding in you.
A lot of people say the same thing to me.
What's it like without her?
l shouldn't have asked. l'm..sorry...
No. No. lt's alright. .
l miss her. lt's been 8 years.
Mom, Dad, Work, my Sisters, their kids,
they keep me going and of course there's time.
Time sort of heals everything.
That reminds me. Go to sleep. Happily.
Don't worry about it too much.
Everything will be ok in the morning.
At least that's what l tell myself.
Chandana's mom is a little surprised
that an lndian cop wants to meet her.
CHANDANA'S Mom : l saw her last at 7.
She was standing nearthe car
and talking to Hitesh.
Ten minutes later, she still hadn't walked in,
so l looked out.
She wasn't there nor was Hitesh's car.
The next day, herfinger was found
hanging in Hitesh's car.
l have been answering the
same question for 2 years, sir.
Just once more, was anyone jealous of
your relationship with Chandana?
Not that l know of.
How long have you known Hitesh?
- For a long time.
We know him very well too.
He's a good chap.
So, you're a doctor is it?
Yeah. Both me and Chandana
went to the same University.
'Brooklyn Medical University'.
Abbott Road.
She was seen here at 8.30 pm
getting out of a car with a man.
The report says the finger
was severed around 9 pm.
She was last seen here at 8.30 pm.
So, where did she go from here?
What's up?
Princeton police...
Come on. We're wasting ourtime.
There is nothing here but dead leaves.
l don't think so.
l have a gut feeling about this.
You have a what?
Back home, it is called
'The Raghavan instinct'.
Come again?
Come!
This place has been closed
to the public for a couple of years.
lt's just an abandoned fort.
No...We cant go in here Raghavan!
There is 'no trespassing sign'!
Oh yeah. lts locked.
Ah shit. You...cant...
Come.
Did you see that?
Maggots?
You don't want me to dig this place up, do you?
l do.
God damn. l am going to look like an idiot.
Jesus! There's more
than one body in here.
You got 4 corpses.
Thanks.
Hey Anderson. NYPD is here.
Yeah. Four (dead bodies) .
They've been here a while.
Up here.
Tell me, Raghavan.
Sir. We've found that girl's body.
What? -Yes. We also found 3 other bodies.
4 bodies all together.
All in different stages of decomposition.
The last one that we found was
Chandana's body with a missing finger.
All of them have been killed by the same guy.
lts obvious a single burial site.
He is a serial killer Sir.
The only mistake made was the fingers
he left hanging, both here and there (lndia).
l think that the first body we found
was buried 2 months ago.
Rani died 9 months ago, in lndia.
The second body that we found here
was buried 9 months ago.
So, l think our killertraveled to lndia in between
those two murders and returned to the States.
As soon as we receive post mortem reports
along with the time / date of death,
we should be able to narrow it down
using the manifesto of passengers
who traveled to Chennai around that time.
Brilliant. Raghavan!
- Thank you, Sir.!
l have asked them not to give
a press release.
So that the matter stays confidential,
between the FBl and the police department.
l believe that since he has buried
all the women in the same location,
he will come back to the site.
So there are 2 police officers
on surveillance in that area.
Something will turn up.
Keep me posted. Yes sir. l will !
Right. Thank you.
Hi. l had a feeling that you walked past.
l was right.
l also have Police lnstinct l guess,
right Nostradamus?
How was your day?
You're here on official work right?
Have you found the suspect?
- l will.
l had an interview today.
lt went well. l have been
asked to join next month.
Congrats.
- Thanks.
Also...l signed my divorce papers
and couriered it to him.
l'm sorry.
-Why? l don't regret it.
l was upset till yesterday but l'm relieved now.
l want to go ahead now ...
Are you heading out?
- Need to take a showerfirst.
Change, then everything else follows...
lf you're not doing anything else afterthat,
dinner's on me!
l have two reasons to celebrate.
lf .. you' re not busy with anything else ?
l did have plans.
But now, its all cancelled... 15 minutes?
The sparkling moon,
The silver sparkling moon
keeps following me wherever!
The sparkling moon,
The silver sparkling moon brought along
all the stars in the sky!

The sun is setting slow
and it is yellow....
The lights that are glowing

Hesitations come to an end

And keeps searching for what next!

Some people take the path

And suddenly get drenched in rain

Who is this woman? Who is this guy?
Seems like the parallel lines can intersect
And two different tracks can converge!

But she stopped me and spoke to me...
And after such a long time,
it was a moment to cherish!
Team ForCe
Mr. Raghavan had already started
an investigation
into his colleague's daughter's murder in lndia
and it was his intuition and expertise that
lead us to the bodies in the woods.
We are now on a hunt for a serial killer.
Anderson from the NYPD did a good job
by consulting the lndian Police..
l think the murder of Ann Morrison in
February 2005 is the key here.
The perpetrator was here 2005 Feb 10th,
for Ann Morrison.
Then he goes back and he murders Rani
on Feb 20th.
He comes back again for Lisa.
lf we could get the passengers manifest
from the immigration,
people who traveled from here to lndia,
February 10th to the 20th,
and we can find a connection between one of the
passengers and the victims, we got our man.
Sorry, suspect.
We'll get him.
Yeah. Who is this guy?
He is out there somewhere.
Why are you asking Amudha?
l'm checking a diagnosis gone wrong.
lf surgery is not an option,
then chemotheraphy.
This guy took me so wrong.
Nobody can catch us.
We're the best Doctors in the world!
Lets go back to our country.
We'll start our own hospital.
We'll dedicate our lives
to the benefit of Society!.
There shall be no more DEATH in this world!
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Let me go. Let me go.
Shut up...fucking bitch..
Look at me. Look at me. lt's me.
l don't like your voice.
Don't make any noise.
Please. Please. Let me go. No no no no.
l'll give you money.
- l don't need your money.
Professor veronica, l am really sorry.
But you should have been nice to me
in class.
Freeze! Put your hands above your head
and turn around!
Turn around very slowly and walk
towards the vehicle.
Put your hands on the hood.
-Just stopped to take a leak guys.
No! Turn, turn!
Okay guys..lla,
there's are only 2 of them. ...Shoot!
What are you rambling on for?
Walk towards the vehicle
and put your hands on the hood.
A man's got to take a leak. Common,
what's it with you guys?
Hey, easy there you are hurting me.
Wait, let me take a look.
Amudha! - llla, there is no one else no?
They've found it.! Dogs.
They've dug it up! Lets get out of here!
Watch your step. Raghavan.
Hello sir.
- Hello
Good evening.
There's been a shooting at the gates
two hours ago.
From yesterdays crime scene.
Two of our guys on surveillance was killed.
l need another 500 names and
l need them tonight.
Anderson! The list we had asked forfrom the
lndian immigration is coming through now.
Oh good.
Hold on. United States lmmigration
info coming in. Heads up.
lt's a surgical knife.
Only someone who has trained to use one,
could have done this
Ya. Me and Chandana went to
the same university,
The Brooklyn Medical University.
Ok Anderson! We've got the list
of the first 10 suspects.
Trilok malik, Ramkumar, Ganeshan, Parthiban,
Amudhan, Sukumaran, Bujji, Babu,
llamaran, Anandhan, Peter, Ravindar
and we've got the addresses.
You go and check them out.
Ok we go and check it out.
l left on the 14th to Coimbatore for
my sisters wedding,
and came back in 2 weeks.
Shopping, wedding...you know how it is.
Can they vouch forthat?
Of course they can vouch!
My father can vouch my wife can vouch.
My father was in the hospital.
He was there for 2 weeks, l went to see him.
Yes, l know llamaran.
He always sticks to a class mate of his
a brilliant student, class topper.
They used to stay on campus.
-what's he saying? -but now they've shifted.
He said llamaran always 'sticks' with his friend.
do you know the address?
Ya. Place in Brooklyin. Spring Street, 16F.
He should know the place
You know the place?
Open up! NYPD!
No.. l don't think there's anyone
in there-Wait wait wait..
Can't we go in?
No we cant! We don't have a warrant!
No what l meant was can't
you pick the lock for me?
No l can't pick the lock foryou!
Are you kidding me?
We do it all the time in lndia.
Hey Anderson! You should
take a look at this!
You should take a look at this!
Anderson!
Take that!
How did you get here, Cop?
l should've killed you in Keeranur !
What the fuckin shit?
Whats wrong with this gun?
llla, wake up! l need help..
l need your help to kill him...get up.
Shit...
Give it to me! lll teach you how to use it.
You are going to die in half an hour.
You've got a severe lung puncture you know...
l've ruptured your lungs ...
you've lost a lot of blood,
that's why yourfeeling dizzy.
ln a few minutes your going to have
a blood clot form in your lungs,
you won't be able to breathe
and then you will die!
The cops will be here in 10 mins!
lf they were coming, they
would've been here by now.
We've been sleeping forthe
last 10 mins! - like a happy family! .
But they aren't here yet! Shit!
Why do you keep saying shit?
ls that your Mom's name?
Pain killer man! Fuckin paining!
l neverthought you would get here.
l saw you in Keeranur digging
up the remains of Rani.
l thought l'd kill you, you were staying
at the Pandian Hotel right?
but he held me back!
lf l had killed you then
you wouldn't have come this far!.
How the hell did you find out?
Don't think you've won.
You can't get me.
You can never catch us!!
What do you mean?
You think your like air?
We can't 'catch' you?
Asshole! come....
Shall l tell you something?
Your dearfriend cried and begged
for his life when he died.
He didn't struggle much, which was
surprising, him being a cop!
Only his wife struggled a lot.
Quite a bitch she was!
and one hell of a lay!
Why did you kill her?
Oh ! you don't know the reason?
His daughter died because of him.
and he died because of his daughter so
why spare the mother?
Have you seen you face?
l wouldn't even hit you with
my slipper! Give me the tape!
l don't like Rani! That's all!
Go tell your dad someone felt you up.
You bloody dog!
Let go of me!
Hey llla, look there...
That's him.
He hit me... Motherfucker...
He could've left it at that
instead of proving he's a Cop.
That's where he made his mistake.
What did they do?
They misbehaved with his daughter sir.
Hey Mayil! What's up?
You usually come only at
the end of the month, right?
Oh just like that... thought
l would pay you a visit.
Not today. May be next week...
ls it so? Ok, l will go then.
Wait ...
Oh my god! You guys are so hot!
One of you is black and the other white.
very nice.
l hated what he did and l was scared.
l have a problem with people like that.
l had not committed a murder in 3 years.
l can't stay patient anymore.
We have to kill them!
Like how people want to give up smoking,
l wanted to give up killing!
But they brought out the devil in me!
What can we do?
Stretch your legs... asshole... stretch your legs....
l wanted to kill all of them NOW!.
First l want to kill the girl.
Then herfather,
the DCP, then the cop at the
station and then the eunuch.
Lets do it llla, come on!
-No Amudha! No...
We are going to the States next week.!
THEY'LL know it's us.
Then when?
Lets get to the States first and
when we come back.
we will kill all of them!
llamaran held me back and
we left the country.
After coming here we couldn't resist.
We wanted to go on a spree,
a killing spree so to speak,
So we did!
l want to send a fingerto your boy friend.
Yourfinger, what do you think?
Chandana, this finger will be found
in Hitesh's cartomorrow.
Take that, white bitch.
Hey.. come here!
l told you not to run right,
Ann. llla lets get started.
We came back to lndia for a holiday 9 months ago.
Never went home, went straight
to see Rani Arokiaraj.
Rani! Hello Rani!
Amudha, now what?
Kill her and throw her body away !
What did you think?
Can we send her home now?
There is no change in
what we decided earlier.
l want to bisect her and then bury her.
Didn't you call me a 'useless idiot'?
Now look at what's happened.
Remember Chandana?
We'll do the same thing.
cut herfinger and hang it in front of her house for
herfatherto get the shock of his life !
then we'll kill him too.
l hate you! l hate yourfather!
l thought it a nice touch to hang Rani's finger
outside Arokiaraj's house.
Before leaving the country,
l wanted to kill Arokiaraj, the eunuch
and everyone at the station
but just then you came in and
ruined the entire plan.
You started digging the minute,
you reached and we left everyone else for later,
and we came back here.
Hello there! l was talking to you.
When we got news that Arokiaraj was here
we killed him the very next day.
The only mistake l made
was you! you police dog,!
And l hung the finger both here and there.
Why?
Seriously, you wouldn't have got us.
This is a story that began many years ago,
l pushed a classmate of mine
from a moving train when l was 13!
Since then l've had this craving
forflesh and blood ...to kill people!
Amudha! What are you doing here?
Just a minute Teacher. l have a doubt.
Why couldn't you ask me in class?
l heard you gave yourself to the Math Prof.
ls it only him... or ?
You idiot! What you are saying?
l thought you were such a nice...
Do you know what good doctors we are?
Seriously! Can you think of such a
combination - doctors plus killers.
Even now, if l want to l can save you. Should l ?
But you won't end it here, right?
Everything was fine until you showed up!
Now everybody will know we are
and it'll be difficult to move in public.
You should die! You should die...
right here, right now.
Take that! Fucker!
lla, Wake up! We need to leave right away.
Don't panic, it's just us.
Come on we need to leave. Fast!
You want the bag?
Where's my leather bag?
What do you need from it?
We don't need all tha t.
Just bring the bag.
Amudha, passports?
- l got them.
Amudha, lets kill him. -Ya.
Say a 'hi' to Arokiaraj from us!
Amudha, lets go.
New York Airport
Two hours afterthe fire was put out,
fire fighters found in a dumpster,
the body of an unidentified lndian male,
He is currently being treated for his wounds
at Caledonia and is in critical condition.
Amudha. We're in trouble.
l think they know about us.
Don't be so loud! There's someone inside!
All the cops have assembled here.
Fucking shit Amudha!
l think they must've got the information late.
Otherwise we would've been caught earlier.
We can still make it.
l got your bags. l'll wait at the door.
You'll join me soon...? Amudha...?
All ok?
Ya... Excuse me!
Ok! Now you are all set.
Hi. These guys are medical students from lndia,
Amudhan and lllamaran.
We know.
We got the information from
Anderson's computer
and from the owner of the flat
that went up in flames.
Did you get them?
No. They boarded a flight from JFK to Bombay.
We had officers stationed at the airport,
but they escaped into the city.
They got away.
Will keep you posted.
Alright. Thanks.
How did you get to know?
Tv. From last evening, all the channels
are covering your story.
l spoke to the doctor.
To start off, you've got a cut on your nose
and you are running temperature.
You've sprained your neck and many
parts of your body have been hurt,
with a knife which is 3 inches deep.
The doctor said it's a miracle that you are alive.
You have a lot of stitches like a C - Section.
Like you've just had a Caesarian .
You have a hair-line fracture too and it will take
atleast one week to remove the cast.
You need to rest for one week in bed,
in the hospital.
Thank you doctor!
l checked out your hotel room,
packed your bags, laptop etc.
l can't handle it! when l think someone has done
this to a girl and is living happily.
Passionate fire...
You mesmerized me...
He is not dead, right? Was he even
remotely burnt or not?
l am not sure.
The news only says he is injured
and is in the hospital.
Team ForCe
l will do the fomentation comfortably

Team ForCe
Are you sure you have to
leave today Mr Raghavan?
The doctor suggests that you need to
rest for 3 more days atleast.
Hi
My friend Sapna.
You can stay at her place till you get
better and then leave.
Thanks. l would really appreciate that
But l have lots to do back home.
l would need a week to settle down.
l'm really alright!
l'll come along with you.
Where to? The Airport right? Sure.
Chennai.
Don't be silly. l'm alright.
Oh it's not because of you !
l really have work in Chennai.
My mother will be coming back with me.
So, l have to go.
l don't want herto travel alone.
Seriously if you hadn't left today
l wouldn't have too!
You see l was planning to leave with you.
Might as well travel together.
Tickets and bags are in the car.
So, you've decided to settle in New York ?
l really don't know.
not yet decided.
l have to come back and
start work.That's about it.
l am not sure if l would settle in NY
or go elsewhere.
lf Arun comes back would you accept him?
No... definitely not and l mean it.
He didn't just throw me away,
but also my daughter
Maya.
She is 11 months old.
She means the world to me.
l could forgive him for everything else
but not this.
He abandoned a 5 month old baby?
Yes.
Ok...but how could you attempt suicide,
leaving behind a 11 month old baby?
l regret even trying,
Sorry l couldn't talk to you about Maya earlier,
l knew you would ask me this question,
lf l had, and l wouldn't have been able
to give you an answer.
l still don't know what to say.
Maya lives with my parents in Chennai.
lt's been two weeks since l left herthere.
Thought l would take her back
afterfinding a job.
That's why l'm going to Chennai.
Aradhna, when do you plan to come back here?
ln a weeks time, next Sunday may be.
Do you really have to ?
Yes. Why?
What if l said l like you?
You want to run away huh?
this very minute! Well,
that's tough.. there's a queue...
Seriously l have fallen in love with you.
l don't think this is the best
place to say. But still...
But once we're out of this gate,
you and me go our separate
ways and l'm not sure
lf l'll have the chance to tell you this again,
Next please.
Sir?
Thanks
What did you see in my 'eyes'?
Like Kayalvizhi, but this time
what did you find in me?
l didn't pay attention to such things this time.
ln the last 12 days, l could feel
something change in me.
Just thought l'd tell you...
When Kayal died, she was 5 months pregnant.
Maya will be the child l lost.
She will be like my daughter,
my own little girl.
l assure you l will be a good father,
Maya will be 'our' daughter. Allright?
Shit!
l cry very easily nowadays.
For me...
l'm not ready for another relationship as yet.
l have a lot to consider.
l don't know if l'm ready to make
the right decisions yet.
l won't be able to handle it if 10 years down
the line Maya tells me l made the wrong choices.
l don't want to think of anything now.
There is nothing that you don't know.
But you don't understand that some things
are better left unsaid.
Your bag...
You dropped a spark of fire in my life
which broke into my emotions like an atom.
Why are you moving away from me and
making it seem like a mirage?
l'm not going to take back
the heart l gave you.
You dropped a spark of fire in my life
which broke my emotions like an atom.
Team ForCe
You are close, yet far...
You are the sky
the waves and sea tries to reach...
Are two hearts not enough to fall in love?
You tell me...
This is indeed the second time for us,
But can't it happen, you tell me?
Do you think this would work?
Can two poles come together?
You moved away after saying it,
And l kept worrying thinking about it!
How am l going to handle this?
You dropped a spark of fire in my life
which broke into my emotions like an atom.
Team ForCe
Something seems to be stopping me,
And keeps telling me l am a woman...
Neither have the wounds in me
healed or disappeared
Even when you brought your hands
to comfort me, l declined.
Come and be mine,
and lose yourself on my shoulder...
l've said whatever has to be told
And now l will wait foryou as long as ever,
ln the direction you would come.
Team ForCe
Why are you moving away from me
and making it seem like a mirage?
l'm not going to take back
the heart l gave you.
At ease. Sit down please.
The guys who misbehaved with Rani Arokiaraj,
were arrested and detained at
Sathanur police station about 2 years back.
lnspector Kumaravel, you committed
a big mistake that night,
plus you did not collect
any information about them.
Sit down.
We could've caught them
when Rani was murdered,
But when l asked you,
you had absolutely no details about them,
You called them 'good for
nothing boys', from Madras.
What kind of a cop are you,
lf you have no intuitive insight
into the character of a criminal?
That's bad police work and
here is a bad policeman.
Sir, the other day...-Sit down.
The unnecessary illtreatment they
got that night, instigated their rampage.
Do you know what that means?
You are also responsible
for Arokiaraj's murder!
The only consolation foryou is,
You are responsible only for his murder,
because they had already committed,
15 murders including Rani Arokiaraj,
and if we were to include Anderson,
Chitra and Mr Arokiaraj, the death count is 18.
We need to find them very soon
and 10 of you from this lot
will leave to Bombay immediately.
Place new check posts in all
the districts in Tamil Nadu
and have a clear watch at
Amudhan's house in his village.
We have a psychopath serial killer duo
on the run and we have to stop them.
l spent about half an hour with them,
and if my thinking is correct they
won't be able to hide fortoo long.
lf we poke them at the right place
they will surely come out in the open,
and target me.
l have a plan...
Both of them are very young.
They might have been involved
in serious accident
when they were 8 or 9 perhaps
that altered their minds.
They both share same ideology,
they have turned into killers.
We have launched a Statewide hunt forthem.
against the Nation Wide
alert that already exists.
They can't stay under coverfortoo long.
To put it literally ''They're finished!''
and to say it in our words
''We'll get them soon.''
Police are inquiring Amudhan's parents.
Dean of the medical college
they had studied says...
Doctors exist to protect
and save lives, not to kill.
The Medical Council of lndia has declared
that Amudhan and llamaran
cannot continue to practice as doctors
and as decreed by our university,
l hereby cancel both their degrees.
So what if they cancel my degree?
Does that mean l'm not a doctor?
Can they do anything to remove the
love for medicine inside me?
You fucker Dean, when l
got the University Rank,
l was splashed all overthe newspapers,
the entire college celebrated!
After so many years l brought
glory to the College.
l'm a Doctor !... l'm a Surgeon...
l'm the best in the world.!
lla can anyone match the D&A Research l did?
2 years of hard work in medicine...
lets kill them all lla!
Do you have to take all this?
what's wrong?
Nothing.
Hey, wasn't she with you at the airport?
l think you should give up your
interior designing job,
and join our department as a detective.
Yes, it's her-Aradhna ok?
Oh! So apart from 'murder investigation in' NY,
there was romance too?
Look, no romance!
We just got to know each other and
spent some quality time together.
Yourfather is very unhappy
about you leaving.
He wants you to cancel the ticket
but you insist on endorsing it.
Mom, please....
Ya, one second, Aradhna, call foryou,
Hello?
Look, she was married, but now separated.
She has a 11 month old baby.
Arun, one second!
Don't you want
to know how Maya is?
you haven't even said one word about her.
You couldn't care less right?
She will be my daughter, my only daughter.
She's a warm person, very beautiful.
She would hardly talk about her problems.
She didn't like it when she cried.
Enough! Just bring her home.
She's very beautiful.
Like l don't know! l proposed to her,
but she said No.
But... that's not the end of the story.
This bus is going to Mangalore.
Stop the bus.
Switch on the lights.- Okay sir.
We are searching fortwo men,
how many passengers are in the bus?- 62
Did you stop the bus anywhere enroute?
No, l didn't stop anywhere.
Ya, Raghavan. No it's ok. Tell me.
They had a gun?
Bombay, Goa, Mangalore, Kozhikode.
Ask them to run a proper check at Kozhikode.
Coimbatore... Salem... Right.
Now ask the Goa team to be more vigilant.
Has the Coimbatore SP been informed?
Have their posters been stuck at all
National Highways and small streets?
Ok... good... get on with it.
Amudha, what do you think you are doing?
We need to get out of here.
We can't keep hiding,
We can't run anymore. Do you understand?
Okay.
l guess it is supposed to end this way.
But if we are caught, we should down in
should be in a blaze of glory!
unmatched forthe next 50 years!
That should be the impact!
What did he call us - 'good for nothing'?
We need to show him our power!

You fucker...

Thoroughly check all the entry
points from Kerala to Chennai.

Chengalpet, Poondamalle...and send about
10 people to check the day trains.

Can you find out the arrival time of the
flight from Calicut to Chennai?
What? 11?
That's in another 5 minutes.
Thank you.
l asked you to hold everyone,
-l couldn't hold everyone Sir.
Sir, it was too late when you called.
The flight had already landed and the
passengers had already started to move out.
What do you think?
Are you joking?
Do you know how serious this is?
Here, take this list and check
every passenger now.
Go to the Poondamalle check post.
Ok lla, 'Operation Raghavan' begins.
Hello, Raghavan!
Aradhana here.
Oh, Aradhana, how are you?

My mind is in a whirl.

l want to stay here...Because of you.
l'm not sure if things would turn out right,
l don't know it's not easy ...
l'm confused... help!
l'll tell you what.
l didn't think twice before saying it
and it's not even been a year since
you were separated from your husband.
Mentally, you should feel ok, and
ourfamilies should be convinced.
l didn't think about all this but now
l realize it's not that easy.
Why don't you leave, very soon - New York,
a new beginning, feel better,
sought out your issues

like me, give me call.

Good. So, go to the airport,
cancel yourticket,
you don't need to go. Alright?
We'll talk with ourfamilies.
We'll wait. Ok?
But from this minute, Maya and
you are my responsibility.
The silver sparkling moon
keeps following me wherever!
The silver sparkling moon brought along
all the stars in the sky!
Bloody shit.. this is irritating me.
Amudha, she's leaving!
You follow her. l'll take care of him.

Where does she stay?
Adyar. But she's really hot !
Even if they don't have anything
to do with each other,
l don't care, l want her!
'nothing to do with each other'

the road holding hands?
Are you sure this place is safe?
Yes. There's no other place
like this inside the city.
