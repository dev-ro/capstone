Marian, yeah, the big
woman, with the purple
eyeshadow, her husband
right works in Customs,
.. so he's on shiftwork,
all the time, but what she
doesn't know is that half the
time he says he's on nights,
he's actually in one of the airport
hotels shagging a prostitute. Yeah?
But not only that, he makes
her dress up like a tourist
and then fucking strip
searches her.. no really..
he makes her stand there
yeah, gets his cock out and
moves it up and down her leg
and makes this bleeping noise
BEEP BEEP BEEP
BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP
Yeah well...
I made the last bit up,
but the rest of it's true. I
swear on my life. And I bet
he's doing something like that.
I'm just borrowing it
I'll slip it back
next time I'm in
You shouldn't leave things laid
around if you don't want them nicked
She won't even
notice it's gone
'Ere look..

She'll think it's fallen
down the back or something
Looking at my war wounds?

So, er what happened?
I used to have behavioural
problems, better now...
All done?

We could stop by one
of the airport hotels?
I usually have a
nightmare getting served..
But you'll be alright

We're practically at

Na he's used to going out
all times of the night..
Shiftworker, his sleep

Always has had
You'll get used to it

go through the lot
Are you mummy's little girl?
What now?!
Dad says he wants to see her
When you're... in my house...
You'll abide by my rules...
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
In this household...
family... is everything.
You can forget what's
outside that wall...
It doesn't exist..
From now on...
this is your world
Your mum and your dad...
...your brother and
your sister... that's it.
You do your chores,
Keep your mouth shut and your mother
happy, or you'll have me to answer to!
You got that?
Your dad's talking to ya!
In return...
You get a roof over your head
You get your meals... you get
all your clothes... anytime...
If you work hard and you're
a very very good girl,
You'll become part
of the family..
Just like your
brother and sister
But if you piss me about!
I swear to God!...
I'll make you wish that
you'd never been born!
Now get to bed...
You've got work to do tomorrow
I just wish you'd you
do what you're told
You and me are
gonna get along fine
Good girl
Good girl
Time to get up!
This'll soon come

You've got the skin for

Must be a foreign thing..
You should see his...
Here... why don't
you show her?
Come on
You hold it
Here look!...
See? I told ya...
Mum reckons it's beautiful,
like a spider's web
I reckon it's more like crazy
fucking paving... what do you think?
Love you finished down there yet
Nearly Mum!
Come one... let get
you washed and dressed
Smells great!
Dad brought 'em
back last night
I saw that cow Kel last night,
she's been giving me dirty
looks all week and talking to
me mates behind my back there
So I found out that she
being saying about me nicking
stuff, and that she's
going to tell the agency..
Birdie, we don't
want any trouble..
It's alright I sorted it. I got her in
one of those store cupboards last night..
And I told her yeah,
that I know about her
daughter, and she can't
keep her fucking mouth shut..
I'm gonna tell everyone
that that little girl's daddy
aint whose she thinks it
is.. that'll keep her quiet..
You'd better eat that, you're
not going to get anything else
How about a cuddle
for your old Dad?
Elbie?
Someone forgotten something?
Is that it?
That's all there was
I swear Mum, I tried to get more of
the loot but I was busy doing her work.
Well can't she
do her own work?
No she's a lazy
fucking bitch..
See what I got Dad...
It's not the best you can get, you
can't do any photos and that but
it's pretty good, thought you could
use it while you were working..
No I gotta keep my ears about me,
dangerous places cargo hangars...
Probably get a good price for
it though. I know a couple of
fellas at work that'd be
interested in this for their kids..
How's it work then?
Choose a song
I'll need my reading
glasses for that
Elbie?
What a mess!
Will you control
your fucking children!
Are you going to make
me late for work?!
It's your fault you
STUPID STUPID BOY!
Put it back on the chair!
Clean this fucking mess up!
You got hold of her?!
OW!
When you've had your breakfast you
can show your sister some chores!
OK...
It's about time you learnt the rule of
this house Angel, and pretty damned quick!
And if you're thinking
of going anywhere, don't!
Save any clothes
size 10 to 12 for Mum
Dad takes XL
I'm a size 6, but I fit a
lot of kids clothes as well...
Elbie takes anything
that looks tall
Electricals go in that
box, and your hairdryers,
razors that kind of
thing, that's for car boot,
Jewellery you can give to me,
and pictures, and tags and any papers
you can put in that bag for burning..
You got it?
And if you don't do your
chores, I'll get Dad on ya..
That's better!
I don't know why you're
being so mardy about it?
You got a cushy job
At least you're in the warm... Elbie's
gotta do all that digging in the yard
Laying concrete
and all that stuff
Poor bastard
You'd like that job, it's interesting,
get to see stuff you know..
Better than the cleaning..
bleurrgh... fucking hate that..
Still, it's gotta be done,
can't have a dirty house...
you've got to keep on top of it
all or it'll get on top of you
That's what me Mum says
Some people... you'll see their cases
and you'll know they're bloody filthy
Shitty pads, bloody tampax, fucking
used condoms,... you wouldn't believe it!
Fucking animals
What you think?
I said.. WHAT do you think?
It looks nice
Yeah
Like you'd fucking know
Stupid bitch
I don't think he's
interested you dirty bitch
Nothing going on up there
Or down there!
You're wasting your time...
You're doing a good job Angel
Keep it up!
I've tidied my bed
Good girl
Birdie?
That's it
Honestly Mum, I've told
ya, it's getting hard to
get anything out of it.
They watch you like a hawk.
They've got these new cameras yeah, and
they're painted the same colour as the wall
you can't even see em, you just
hear them move, just zzz zzzz zzzzzzz
Yeah alright..
Like these insects, it's not just
that they're all nosey cows at work..
Your mother's said ENOUGH!
I just wanna read my bloody
paper in peace alright?!
Sorry Dad...
Pass me a bit of that Salami
Stupid fucking little shit!
What do I have to fucking say
to you about peace and quiet?
Dad... it's not... it's
not what it looks like!
SHUT UP!
You been lying to us?!
Well what's THAT
then... Scotch Mist?!
Saving to but a
present for ya...!
For both of yer...!
I don't believe you,
It's true, I swear
We don't have secrets in this
family! Do you understand?
There's nothing that
comes in or goes out of
this house that me and
your Mum don't know about
But... I...
NO BUT!
NO EXCUSES!
Do you wanna stay a
part of this family?
What shall we do with her?
Get to your room Birdie!
And stay there til I say so
Good girl
Good girl Angel
Stupid fucking bitch!
What are you
fucking looking at?!
Uh?!
You what? I can't hear yer?
Cut your tongue?!
Dunno what you're looking
so fucking smug about!
Do you think you're gonna
last long with her around?
Ain't you realised?
They've got a new toy now... what do
they need a fucking lump like you for eh?
I've seen the way
Mum looks at her...
God's fucking gift!
But you, you're old news... when was
the last time she played with you eh?
Maybe it's time they got a
new little brother as well!
Fucking retard!
I know you're gay, you think
you can put that fucking spastic
act on, and they'll leave you
alone like that thing upstairs?
Well it ain't gonna happen.. I'll tell you
now, you gotta be a real part of this family
That's the only
way you'll get by...
You've got to make
them love you..
...more than they
love anything else...
Elbie?
I see you sent her off then?
Do you wanna do
the same for me?
Aw that's it... ooh
Ahh... that's special
Yeah!
Yes... fucking lovely
Whoa! on that spot there...
Careful girl!

Shut up Birdie!
You're my good
girl aren't you?
My Angel!
Yes Mum
You got your voice back
Angel... when did that happen?

And you didn't tell me then?!
It was only a couple of words!
Not even proper speaking...

didn't think that you'd be...
Well you should be thinking!
Do you think me and you Dad
get by without thinking?!
What do you say?
I'm sorry
Fetch my bag!
Just gonna give you a
little top-up Angel...
Please don't...
Alright...
Not really...
I promise not to scream
I'll be a good girl

Shut up Birdie!
Do you know what
you're saying Angel?
Yes...
Cos you know what
happens if you make a fuss
Dad
That's right
And we don't want that do we?
No...
No...
Alright, we'll give it a go
If you think you can behave
Right let's get started
See how much nicer it is
when you play along Angel?
That'll make all
the difference...
Hey Birdie?
There's this thing about this woman in
Russia yeah, she gave birth to her own twin!
One's all twisted,
and on the outside
On eye here, and
the other there
Imagine that inside ya
Still... at least you don't have to
look after it. Just chuck it in the bin.
Here listen to this!...
my car crash horror...
Gary King looked out of the mess that held
togther, the smashed bones of his face,
and he saw three faces looking down at
him from the end of the hospital bed.
Two children, and a woman, all with tears
in their eyes, the voices were calling
'Daddy Daddy', but Gary couldn't remember
ever seeing them before in his life
The crash had destroyed his
face, and nearly ended his life
and also robbed
him of his memory..
He forgot his own kids
Can you believe that?
Right, I'm going shopping
Can I come too?
You're grounded
Alright Angel?
Elbie keeping you busy?
Yes Mum
Good girl
Where's this come from Angel?
I... I dunno?
I got two of you
lying to me now have I?
Dissapointed Angel...
very dissapointed...
I thought you were learning
But now it turns out you're
a little two faced cow!
All that pretending?
No Mum...
Elbie...
No... NO...
Please, not... HUH!

mess? with me my girl
PLEASE.. please

Bit of a stronger dose

I got a special job
for you when you wake up
Keep your eyes on here
Birdie?

Summin wrong?
Something's just fallen off from
that and bounced off the bonnet
Took the paint off actually..
Oh yeah, it's the
poxy fucking roof innit
I'll have to look up there and see if I've
lost any roof tiles. Shall we do this later?
Na you're alright,

Cheers I was gonna say, have you seen

Hold her there!

FUCKING SPOT ALRIGHT?!

Put her INSIDE!
Get me the mallet!
Na not that one! The big one!
Try to show me up in front
of my friends would ya?
Get her out!
Serves you right
SHUT IT Birdie!
Look... what you made me do
Did you know how long
I've known that fella for?
Fifteen years!
Fifteen fucking years!
And now, I have had to take
him apart... all because of you!
How do you think his wife and kids is
gonna feel when he don't come home tonight?
You said he didn't see his kids... you said
Karen had got an injunction out on him..
Don't interfere when I am
disciplining the kids ALRIGHT?
Didn't I tell you what would
happen if you broke the rules?
Didn't I fucking tell ya?
Why did you do it eh?
Did you think you'd get his attention?
Think he might take you out or something?
What your Dad not good
enough no more for you eh?
You have to flirt with some
passing fucking stranger?
I'll tell you what... as
you fancy him so much..
Why don't you give him a kiss?
Come on!
Don't be shy!
There you go, are
you satisfied!?
You got your kicks!
You got your jollies!
Tell you what... you've
had it easy up til now...
Your mother?... she likes her boys and
girls around so she can play with them
Me...?
Well, you've seen what happens
when you're a Daddy's girl
Dad?
DAD!
She's mine, remember?
Get her out of
my fucking sight!
So I go in there and there's this mountain
of boxes, I'm talking 30 or 40 foot high
All full of brand new jeans..
From the outside it all
looks normal, until you look
at the bottom of the pile
and there's this loose box
So Joey get's down on his hands
and knees and pulls it out..
and there's this tunnel going
right through through the middle..
What, like
a secret way in?
Yeah... only not so fucking
secret.. cos when you crawl through
there you see the back of the boxes
and they've all been ripped open
and there's hundreds of pairs
of jeans just hanging out...
The fellas in the warehouse
have been going in there, putting
them on two at a time, and
walking them straight outta there!
Can you get me a pair?
Birdie, you've got a whole
box of clothes downstairs?
Yeah but they're
all second hand
Please Dad?
I'll see..
If you're a good girl
Aren't I always?
Put that lot in the sink
Oh for fucks sake
Birdie, go and give him a hand
Some fucking trophy that eh?
Dad!
Oh you silly bugger!
What you keeping
all that for anyway?
Never you mind
It's a surprise...
Oh I forgot to tell ya, there's a couple
of new girls starting at work next week
Oh yeah?
Yeah. Lisa reckons they're
over on dodgy visas?
I thought maybe you might...
We'll see..
Now I hope you've learnt
your lesson Angel...
Cos there's only so much disobedience
me and you Dad can put up with..
Now if you're a good girl tonight... we'll
see if we can get you back in your own room?
You'd like that wouldn't you?
And if I do that
for you Angel...
...then you've got to behave.
Because the next time you plays
up... you have to deal with Dad
I'll wash my hands of you
So.. why don't you
lie down, and...
you think about
what you've done.
Elbie?
Come here and give me a hand!
Daddy?
Mommy?
I told you she'd get out of the window
didn't I? you wouldn't bloody listen!
IT'S CHRISTMAS!
My dad's got a load
of Christmas stuff from
the airport, early
delivery, what do you think?
Oh no you don't!
Have a little drink!
Just... have a little drink!
Who wants a present first?
ME!
Here you are darling,
that one's for you
Wow!
You've been a naughty
girl have't ya?
Don't lie to me!
You've been up
to the top floor
Do you think she
wouldn't tell me?
Well let me tell you
something... she's my flesh and blood
She was born right
here on that carpet
I had to pull
her out meself...
Purple she was... cord
wrapped round her neck
I had to bite through it
It was the first taste
I ever had of her!
All the piss and shit
and stink of her mother
Just like a
little doll she was
Could've put her
in a picture frame
My little darling
I thought she were gonna
stay that way for ever
Now look at her
But she's still
my flesh and blood
Whereas you...
You're nothing
You're not even human
You're just...
...a pet!
We've got a saying
in this family...
...a pet's not for life...
...just for
Christmas!
Elbie... get a
cloth or summin'...
Gently boy!
He's got to clean her..
He doesn't have
to be so rough!
She shouldn't be down
there in the first place
She's family!
It's Christmas!
It's a family
fucking time of year!
Sorry love..
You're right
It's Christmas
I'm sorry... it's my fault
I shouldn't drink before lunch
Just stick together...
you know that
Here look...
Where d'ya get that?
It was in his pocket
He probably pinched it...
I did think it was
worth a few quid though
I didn't get you
anything I been so busy...
Don't need anything
I got you!
Tell you what...
You sure?
Yeah
Here you are...
.. not that you deserve it
Give it 'ere!
Boring!
Lemme have a look
That's lovely that is!
You're a very lucky
girl, you know that?
Birdie, Elbie, why don't you take Angel
up stairs so she can try on here new dress?
But we haven't finished
doing the presents yet?!
There's time for that later
Do what your mother says!
Come on!
What do you fucking look like eh?
You'd better make
the most of today...
...because I don't think you're
going to be around much longer
Mum and Dad get a bit funny
when they've had a drink
You know what it's like
Merry Christmas Angel...
Birdie?
You finished yet?
You can finish her off...
I'm going to get
some more presents!
Look what
I've got for you...
...now now... if

You just lie there...
I'll be mother...
I've been looking
for to this Angel
Dad!
Stupid bitch!
GET IT OPEN!
It's locked!
Help me...
Help me, help me...
I'm walking down this railway
track, I've got tears in my eyes,
Trying to read a letter from my
home. If this train runs me right
I'll be home tomorrow night. I'm
nine hundred miles from my home.
And this rain I ride on Is
one hundred coaches long.
You can hear that whistle
blow a hundred miles
If this train runs me right
I'll be home tomorrow night
Cos I'm nine hundred
miles from my home
And I hate to hear that
lonesome whistle blow.
I'll pawn you my watch
And I'll pawn you my chain;
Pawn you my gold
and diamond ring
If this train run me right
I'll be home by tomorrow night.
Cos I'm nine hundred
miles from my home.
Walking down
this railway track
And I've got tears in my eyes,
Trying to read a letter from my home
If this train run me right
I'll be home by tomorrow night.
Cos I'm 900 miles
from my home...
And I hate to hear that
lonesome whistle blow
