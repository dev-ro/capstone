What now seems incredible ...
... was a century ago
biftere reality.
The Indians tried with all power
the whites to cope.
Stout brave pioneers pushed ever
further to the west ...
... with in their footsteps adventurers,
bandits, Desperado's.
The Mescalero Apaches were -
the good-minded whites ...
... but they had something
where the intruders to dorsften: --
Country and gold.
Gold only from his shed
was achieved as it was necessary ...
. .. by chief Intschu-Tschuna
or his son Winnetou.
Winnetou, friend and protector
of anyone who needed help.
His name sounded in each tent,
with any campfire.
Come on.
Leave it to jump.
Quiet.
Watch out.
To quiet down.
Where did he come from that gold?
Speak.
I know a good method.
Enough.
Speak up. Where is the gold?
What doeje? Are you crazy?
He dead. Now you know not
where gold is.
Now only dead Apache.
How Tangua receives vuu_ater now?
Fire Water? There is enough vooriullie.
Get in the convoy.
My friend Bullock helptje do.
The leader is a rookie.
From him you will not suffer.
Is there something, Bullock?
-No, I'm looking for a good camp.
Not before we are on the prairie.
I'm Sam Hawkins. We are hunters
and explorers for Great Western.
We have stocks and ...
-I know. You're the city boy, HC?
Yes, but how weetjij that?
You know the famous Sam Hawkins not?
That's me.
These are Sam and Dick.
We know the captain datiij are.
-No, he is.
I only watch on wagons
Great Western.
Yes, yes. Then he is also a rookie,
if he so by india area attracts.
Indians who love
guns and whiskey.
Hebje seen Indians?
-Only their tracks. Kiowa's.
It is peaceful here.
But I can smell the danger.
It is just too peaceful ...
Everybody on his hat.
-Be on your guard.
Wait. Now shoot.
We need to throw up.
Vomiting?
I eats them with skin and hair.
They come back.
Keep your weapons ready.
Extinguish the fire.
Very smart, Chief.
-We drive slowly and deaf 't fire.
No, they fall back on.
No, we make very little chance.
Let us give up.
There are too many.
You think where they wait?
Go beyond those covered wagon ride.
-This is the krui_agen.
What are you doing?
I would be such a nice guy
pain not want to do.
You've heard me, Winter.
-If that gunpowder explodes, we go out.
Forward.
-Okay.
Closer.
Jump on the horses.
What was that?
Did you hear that?
Oh, that's ...
These are ...
Look at who is coming. Indians.
Our first Indians. What fun.
A minute stand still.
One minute, for the photo.
I am a friend of all Indians.
I just take a picture.
For the Oxford Times.
The whites have our brother
Black Eagle slain.
They come with their horse iizeren
in our country without us asking.
They become our bumels off.
Today they have the sacred
white bumel shot.
lntaschu-Tschuna want war,
and the tribal elders, too.
Winnetou spremenjena humble
to _ekihpetra .. .
... foryou are already long in the Apaches.
You're white, and therefore we ask
Turn your board.
A man must think first of peace
before he thinks of blood and death.
Blood calls for blood.
Apaches we do nothing, teMrijl
the whites of our dead warriors.
It is pointless. A man must be both
directions hearing before he finds.
Let the tribal elders decide.
Working through, guys.
The convoy.
This is Mr. Jones, the camp boss.
This rookie has us all
life saved.
So you have had problems.
-Yes, Kiowa's.
Kiowa's?
Shall we talk about there?
Weetie sure that the Kiowa were?
Vergisje you not?
I really do know the difference between
a Kiowa and Apache.
Bancroft said the Kiowa's friends
and the Apaches enemies.
He is right. We lay rails
on land that we do not deserve.
It is the Apaches.
If there is technical
problems ...
... we need with the Indians
start talking.
How do you know all this?
I'm an engineer. I got this country
self-identified.
I know that there are no technical
problems ...
... and that never Bancroft
the Indians negotiated.
Do you have a card?
My original plan was
the Apache-field untouched.
But now, let's cross through it.
I never knew there was a plan.
Therefore, I am here.
Mr. Widner, the chief engineer
send me ...
... to ensure that Bancroft is
to my plan.
I have to talk to him.
You know where he is?
In Roswell, 27 miles away.
Yes, I am.
-Do you have a room available?
I first want to know who you are.
-Excuse me. I'm Tuff Tuff, Oxford Times.
I am from England
Indians in order to photograph.
Unfortunately, it is not yet geluM.
But I'm optimistic.
Why an umbrella, the sun schiint.
The tripod-use me to rise.
So ... first my right leg.
And the umbrella makes
for a soft landing.
My own invention.
I have already sought patent.
Who is that?
He will shoot-Indians.
For the Oxford Times.
What is that a strange knakker?
-Mr Santer. The most powerful man here.
Bancroft, you kijM the last few days
so worried. What is it?
I had the Apaches need to talk.
If Great Western finds out ....
That you have betrayed the Apaches
and a pretty penny in your pocket?
If the Great Western discovered ...
-That isje own fault.
JII'm not afraid that's not the Kiowa
help if the Apaches attack?
I 'm more about their friend,
but I have already settled.
So I have your word?
Absolutely. In a few weeks catching
we get the money and we lubricate 'm.
Satisfied?
I quit, Santer.
-Since it is too late for that.
According to this document we are partners.
That will confirm each judge.
We are in the same boat,
Bancroft.
You want the money anyway?
So let me in the lurch.
Forget it, understood?
And no kidding matter.
You understand me, HC?
Is this seat taken?
I'm Tom Agnes Tuff
the Oxford Times.
Excuse me ...
Cheers.
-Move, this is my place.
Sorry, madam. What a coincidence.
Would you dance with me?
Dancing?
Here ... without lady.
I protest!
I will give you action to the press report.
Then you can shake it.
I do not want everyone you come.
-lndianen_
Tangua hello, my friend.
Tangua battle cost too many warriors
and horses.
That is a pity. I have ...
Tangua wants fire-water and tobacco.
That will come. A little patience.
Now. I wait with sunsets.
Then your enemy.
Play dance music.
What about that, Bullock?
Everything is lost. There were
three men from the camp to ...
... and that guy from the east
held me in the eye.
He has ontdeM that we
the route have changed.
When is he here?
-Tomorrow. With the cars.
Take the cars away.
I go searching Bancroft.
And I'm going to figure out why Bullock
Sun plobeling disappeared.
Ken JII that blond guy?
-No, he is a stranger here.
What a guy.
Put the trip but head.
None sermon, please.
Remember that you Santer's
're girl, Belle.
I ve_achfte you al
-Me?
Yes, you. You're the spy
Great Western.
Good, then we understand each other
anyway.
I have the time. Tell it.
Sorry, I can only
discuss with Bancroft.
He is very ill.
Right, yes. Why is our line
not constructed according to the plan?
Oh, we have ...
I got drafted the plan itself
for Great Western.
Who has changed?
-In this way we save costs.
Who are "we"?
-I, Frederic Santer.
If the Apaches declare war,
our work is in danger.
That is my case.
No, I must at Great Western
prevent ...
... that on Apache land
built. And I like me.
Walk me prefer not to the feet.
You want me to stop?
Yes.
Buzzer someone?
-Mr Bancroft.
Why?
-I have to discuss something with him.
I want to talk to you, senor.
-What, senorita?
At the bar.
-Who do I like to call.
See you later.
I find Mr. Bancroft.
Give me a jug of water.
I am sorry, but I must speak.
What do you want?
I am of the Great Western.
The whole project is wrong.
We must do something
before the Apaches ...
Santer and then?
My hands are tied.
I can not do anything.
In our camp, you are safe.
It's pointless.
Leave him alone.
Hands up. Who is verroert,
a blue bean.
To quiet down.
We need you but
Old Shafterhand call.
And now you go neatly
stand against the wall.
Good. Put your hands
but neatly in your neck.
And go metjullie head
against the wall stand.
Beautiful. And now steps back.
Good. That is certainly
not so easy?
And here comes the surprise:
Who is moving, is dead.
Bunch of losers, stand up.
Not nutten. What happened?
Your father consulted me
on those whites.
JII must decide, Winnetou,
even though hetje heavy.
Maybe you ask too much of me.
If he is chief,
will listen to your entire tribe.
They have broken their word. She
rob our country and kill our people.
They will not bring peace,
but their way is not ours.
I am sorry, but I ask you
no more to give orders ...
... until we receive
Great Western.
Jones, go to Roswell and get
the material and the men there.
Would you stop working?
-Yes, as soon as possible.
If the Apaches attack,
our workers massacred.
Yes, but it's Sunday.
The men are at the steps.
I'm going tomorrow to Roswell
and tell them what you want.
Santer as they hold in Roswell ...
lndianen.
-Come on.
There, there are _ee.
They have no war paint on.
But they are Apaches.
We are in Apache country.
-I was afraid they would come.
He he had to command
held. What now?
Who is there to negotiate with them?
I will do. I am aware
Apache in each tent.
Tell the workers that they should calm
stay. Old Shatterhand, Bancroft, come with me.
Let Your arms here.
Hello, any of you gentlemen
is empowered to negotiate?
He called me a gentleman.
I live for thirty years
by the Mescalero Apache's.
The tribe calls me Klekihpetra, Blanke
Father, though I am not related to them.
I've heard tell about a white
schoolmaster in this region.
That's me. This is Winnetou, the son of
the chief Inbchu-Tschuna.
Shall we take a po_ow?
What brings you here?
This case will take us to Apaches.
This is my country.
What are they doing here?
Mr. Bancroft and Mr. Jones are friends.
She lay on the iron rails
horse that will help this country.
This country of the Apaches.
Yes, we gave you our word ...
-And why do you have it broken?
No, Great Western wants iullie strains
not disturb.
He particularly spremenjena you?
Yes. Old Shatterhand is a courageous fighter.
-How is it called?
Old Shatterhand,
because of his lightning-fast fist.
Old Shafterhand want our houses
robberies?
Departure than today
you men of Apache country.
That does not.
-Why not?
It takes time for our men
and stuff to get away.
How much time does Old Shatterhand
need?
Eight to ten days.
Agreed, but no longer.
Look.
Santer and his men.
Surround them.
We are only visited.
If our scattered Bancroft
is not.
He forgot a_cheid me to take.
Niemaar, partner?
My former partner.
Come with me.
Have you no pride?
Yes Bancroft, hebje no pride?
Come on, you.
Well well, who is the chief?
What do you want here?
Winnetou demands on behalf of his father
that we keep to the contract.
Oh, he insists that?
I have sense to cut your liver out.
Since when are you giving dirty
Indians orders? Give anmoord.
Tie him on his horse.
We have to talk.
Yes, we.
You must save and Winnetou
are brothers. Brothers.
We must quickly leave.
We must liberate Winnetou.
How? Santer will extradite him
to the Kiowa's.
And the Apaches? They will
want revenge for his death.
Let us prove that we
to their side.
That sounds easy.
How do you deal?
Tomorrow we go to Roswell
Santer and taken prisoner.
And we send his friends to hell.
Great idea, though I say it myself.
Apaches always our enemy.
Dirty coyote Winnetou now die.
He has many Kiowa's slain.
Take him away.
As the sun rises, the
Winnetou repent.
He will long burn at the stake.
First, find out where the gold
of the Apaches is clogged.
By sunrise, Klekihpetra,
we will avenge your death.
Boss, listen.
- I'm busy.
Jones's camp has been broken
and left.
They are looking for u.
I will take him to graze, damn.
Send a message to Tangua
that he should come here.
lndianen, Kiowas. Tangua to the others.
What is it?
Winnetou-escaped. Apaches come.
Tangua, wait.
We hide ourselves in the Sierra.
Urge everyone to the saloon.
Jose, remove the ammunition from
the arsenal. Come on.
Gentlemen, just wait.
Hold stand, would you?
Do you have anything against the Oxford Times?
Old Shafterhand, I come from
the other side of the city.
We have Santer surrounded.
-Good. Forward.
Come get your arms.
We leave.
Hasta la vista, senorita.
I see you again soon.
They are here.
To the south.
Back to the saloon.
Search coverage.
This takes too many men.
Now it's my turn.
What you gonna do?
I try to phrases that man
to get.
If he goes there unarmed,
you will be killed.
Santer not even shoot
on an unarmed man.
Jones No, go back.
You're crazy. Go back.
You're surrounded. You can
not getting away.
We have already lost too many men.
Geefje about doin 'boys
and come here with your hands up.
You get a fair trial.
What say you, Santer?
I will give you a an_oord.
He has him,
the dirty bastard.
Give me coverage. I'm going to get him.
Hang on, Jones.
Listen. Remove the locomotive
and lay rails ...
What is it, Bancroft?
Can not you at a little blood?
That just a little.
For them, yes.
Bancroft, go to the window.
Do what I say.
Come on.
Go now.
Bullock, as he does not stand,
schietje him down.
Do not shoot, it's Bancroft.
Go on.
Too bad, Bancroft.
You're dead.
Soon we pass the same way.
We sit here in the fall.
Come here.
There is 80 pounds of dynamite in the cabin.
That we should have.
That we never get.
They smack us down.
We dig a tunnel. If necessary
do we have the whole night.
Maybe he can get them out
saloon on fire by the stabbing.
No, they have giizelaars.
We should surprise them.
There will still be shot.
Wait a minute ... Jones said something
before he stie_.
Sam, it's the only way to Santer
to tackle without a shot.
I will shorten my hat.
Even my scalp.
Do what I said.
- I 't do.
See you later.
Sometimes I do not know more
I must omh_lzen or murder him?
Faster.
- It is full of stones.
There are people outside, but it is too dark.
If we stand by the window, shoot them.
Keep the short fuses,
otherwise they throw them back.
As short as possible, boss.
Once the light is
we ui__g a job.
There they are.
It's Old Shatterhand succeeded.
What is that?
Sorry, but that train to Indianapolis?
- Find cover, we are going to shoot.
I just asked where the train goes.
- And I said, looking coverage.
Everybody ready?
Yes.
Boss, they have laid rails.
The locomotive comes right at us.
It is our success.
Sam, hoorjij something?
The Apaches are coming. Indians.
Put the cars between the houses.
No. We are friends, Winnetou.
Sister ...
Would you happen to El Paso?
- Yes.
Can you take a telegram?
-Of course, if you will pay.
What a deserted plain.
Where are you from?
Roswell.
- Roswell? There were the Indians.
I have unfortunately inherited from nieb.
Listen:''The Oxford Times.
In place of group of Indians do I
Coughing an exclusive photo of Crow.
Who are you?
How 's your name?
How 's your name?
In my language-Nscho-Tschi.
That means Beautiful Day.
But spremenjena-...
Klekihpetra taught me and Winnetou
your language.
Yes, that's true. He was a good man.
Who are you?
-The sister of Winnetou.
You're very ill.
How long?
-More than a week.
Eat this soup. You'll sure
their energies.
What do they do?
She invoked the spirit of Klekihpetra on.
What is wrong with Santer happened?
He has fled and his punishment
escape, says my brother.
And my friends?
-They are here as prisoners.
They will be geomerd. You too,
foryou are just like the rest.
Santer has killed and Klekihpetra
Winnetou to the Kiowa's extradited.
Who injustice does not exist, is also
guilty. The law of the Apaches.
I hebje brother rescued.
That lie ie, fear
to be slain.
That makes a real man.
I never lie. Say Winnetou
I want to talk to him tomorrow.
Well, but I waarschuwje.
My brother can forgive everything,
but do not lie.
Never.
Old Shafterhand want me to speak?
-You know wieje has liberated?
The sacred power of Manitou.
In the pocket of my coat is a box.
-Keep going.
Open it and you'll know
Who has rescued you.
I know consolidation lies. Your coat is used
to connect to your wounds ...
... and left in Roswell.
-How could I know?
I thought Old Shatterhand
fair was ...
... omdatje said liquidation our rights
respects.
But I was wrong. You're bad.
I will give you only see
on the day that you ste_.
Thank you.
What has Nscho-Tschi today?
Why do not you laugh?
Tell me.
Tomorrow will Winnetou Old Shatterhand
to see you.
And the daughter of the chief may
show no pity or cry.
But would he want a question
bean_oorden?
Yes.
Hebjii really bevriid my brother?
-Yes, but I can not prove it.
Verwachtje that ikje faith?
Yes.
Zweerje it?
I swear.
Then it is true. You have my brother
only well placed.
But he will believe us?
Here goes then. On my scalp will
they still experience a surprise.
Let him go.
Weetie have said that I would ikje
see on the day of your death?
And he'm strong enough
to our torture conventions?
Well then, buoy his hands.
The Apaches are so afraid of me?
Come on.
Old Shafterhand, I will not older
than I already am, that's for sure.
Would not you want You to Us
was back in the east?
Nscho-Tschi has Old Shatterhand
leave.
What did he say?
He is not sure ofjij,
I and the boys are really guilty.
Whatever he does,
I am absolutely sure.
Manitou will decide. That means
that we must pass a test.
Can you deal with our canoes?
Yes.
Follow the Pecos beyond
the third bend.
As you see on the left
a sacred image.
If Old Shafterhand reached that point,
you all are free.
And why would not succeed me?
Old Shatterhand's canoe will
not get very far.
My father will follow him.
Is hii armed?
-With his tomahawk.
If hii Old Shatterhand kills,
the others will be incinerated.
What weapons do I get?
-You are brave and wise.
Try not to escape the fighting.
We will be close to you.
You have no chance of the picture
to reach.
Winnetou will follow you with his arrow
and arm. There is no hope for you.
I'm ready.
Vaa_el, good friend.
You're a lucky man.
I would also prefer to die quickly and painlessly
hetjachtgebied on.
Manitou.
What he see down there, Hawkins?
-Nothing. I du_ not to look.
Without me, he was doomed to die.
The worst thing is that miin scalp jeuM,
and I can not scratch.
ls-Tschuna too cowardly Inbchu
to only fight?
Wait he Winnetou and his warriors?
If Inbchu-Tschuna afraid for me,
I have come to him.
Your chief was unharmed.
Who is the winner?
Manitou is gracious Old Shatterhand.
Salad-us free?
I bend me for the Law of Manitou.
My brother.
My brother.
If the sun is rising, we must go
and take revenge on the murderer.
So she still lives. And they are
thick friends with the Indians.
What do we do with them?
That comes later. First, I would like
the gold of the Apaches.
They do not really their mouths ...
-Silence.
Draw a line from there to where
diejongen we took the gold.
Let your right to that spiky
rocks. That must be it.
Quickly, my pants. She is coming.
That looks good.
As always. I just have
had no time for the vrou_jes.
You have good hair.
My dear, dear schatie.
- I dear baby?
Good. Say 'baby'.
You wigwam sweetie to take?
What? Wedding?
Sam Hawkings will never marry.
Yes. No marriage, no love.
What is it? Stay right here,
my sweet baby.
Stay right here.
I do everything for you.
Come into my arms, baby.
Nscho-Tschi is glad Shafterhand Old
do not go back to that dark place.
Oh, I do not know.
I have to go soon.
What is it?
Nscho-Tschi is stupid, but they should
smart as Old Shafterhand.
If they would go to school,
they would also be smart.
This is a great idea. That would
you really help his tribe.
Nscho-Tschi want more than that.
Nscho-Tschi has all sorts of ideas.
She is a wise girl.
You'll miss her.
She is still much to learn.
It is good as she is.
But what will your father think?
He fears that the ways of
the white man will take over.
At a school girl?
We are going tomorrow.
-Good.
Then we go back
Klekihpetra's killer to.
There are at least forty.
Good, that's easy maaM
for them to follow.
Careful.
Well, Old Shatterhand,
where we are tomorrow.
But there is still plenty of work. And you
are not a rookie anymore. Gaje with that?
No, I want to first ensure that Santer
no evil can do.
Who have something together.
Did you know that Moon is in love with me
and how I escaped to her?
That was after me nobody can do.
Is Beautiful Day happy that her wish
released?
Yes, they will do everything
learn about your world.
Have you met the gold?
No, only the chiefs know
where the gold of the Apaches is.
lnbchu-Tschuna says
that it only caused misery.
They only get the gold tomorrow
to exchange ...
... against something called watjullie money.
Then they send me to school.
Will you be unhappy when you are away?
No, we will see each other soon
meet again.
How do we cut it off?
We follow the path behind them and bliiven
until we find the gold.
Here are our separate ways, brother.
I do not stuurje road, but our law.
And that goes for our entire tribe.
They may the gold of the Apaches
not see.
My father and I go. You drive
until the sun goes down.
Wait until tomorrow
in the Valley of the Bumel.
We must take a_cheid
of Beautiful Day.
Nabi, the god of death, bedeM
Nscho-Tschi with its black wings.
Nscho-Tschi has now resting.
I loved her, Winnetou.
Now I know it, and she is dead.
Manitou watches over her, my friend.
