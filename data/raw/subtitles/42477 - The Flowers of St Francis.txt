Praise be to Thee, my Lord,
through all Thy creatures...
...especially brother Sun,
who illuminates the day.
And beautiful is he and radiant
with great splendour.
(FRANClS, GOD'S JESTER)
Of thee, most High,
he bears the likeness.
Praise be my Lord, for
sister Moon and for the stars.
ln heaven, Thou hast formed
them luminous, precious and fair.
A Rizzoli production
Praise be my Lord,
for brother Wind,
...and for the air and clouds,
and all the weather...
...through which you give
all Thy creatures nourishment.
lnspired by the''Fioretti'' of San Francesco
Praise be my Lord,
for sister Water,
...she is greately helpful,
humble, precious, and pure.
Praise be my Lord,
for brother Fire...
lnterpreted by non-professional actors
...through whom Thou
illuminate the night...
The role of The Tyrant Nicolaio
played by Aldo Fabrizi,
...and who is fair, cheerful,
powerful and strong.
Praise be my Lord,
for our sister, Mother Earth,
who sustains us
and governs us...
and brings forth diverse fruits
with coloured flowers and herbs.
Praise be my Lord,
for those who forgive for Thy love...
...and bear suffering and trial.
Blessed those who
shall in peace endure,
...for by Thee, most High,
they will be crowned.
Praise be my Lord,
for our sister, bodily death
...from whom no living
man can escape.
Woe to them who
die in mortal sin.
Blessed be those who she
finds in Thy most holy will,
...for the second death
shall not harm them.
God hath chosen the foolish things
of the world to confound the wise,
Praise and bless my Lord,
and the weak things of the world
to confound the things that are mighty
...and serve him
with great humility.
Paul. l Corinthians, 2:27
To conquer the world,
Francesco became humble
and a clown to merit
the Kingdom of Heaven.
Everyone mocked him and said
he was mad.
But Pope lnnocent lll let him
preach to the people,
his faith in gentleness
and poverty.
Now Francesco is returning from
Rome with his companions.
Their hut is occupied. They go on
to Santa Maria degli Angeli.
From there they will take
to the world
the power of their meekness
and their sweet love of peace.
''lf l were preaching,
l'd begin like this:''
l've come to tell you a big
secret that will make you happy.
l'll teach you how to find
real peace.
And joy!
And joy! Because joy and peace
are what men most desire.
l'd talk of glory. We should have
the spirit of the perfect knight.
He wishes us to preach the
word of God with charity.
Ardour springs from a heart
full of joy.
l think a Christian should
love to struggle.
lt's great to struggle for
a cherished dream.
You mean virtue? The joy l mean
is what the soul has
when it can dominate the
passions that trouble it.
Remember how calm it was
those starry nights
when dreams enchanted our youth?
Then the weather broke the spell
that could have harmed us.
Now the Pope has blessed us, we
must make known this new reality.
The joy we feel today
is from this struggle...
which divine Providence
has inspired us to.
But why, Brother Bernardo, don't
you show us how to behave
to achieve such peace of soul?
You should imitate Christ in His
poverty and humility!
Let there be joy! Let there be glory!
Let people rediscover the
joy of loving!
Slowly, brother. Were you thirsty?
But why you? Why you?
What do you mean?
Why does everyone follow
you, Francesco?
Why do they all want to see you,
hear you, and obey you?
You're not tall, handsome, or noble!
Because God could find no lower
creature on earth
nor a sinner worse than l,
in order to show that all virtue
and good comes from Him, not us.
Glory be His name for all eternity!
That's why l follow you,
too, Francesco!
Someone's in there.
-What do you want?
-We need to rest, brother.
Bring my donkey back in.
l'll give you rest!
-But we built this hut ourselves.
-Now it's mine.
That is hardly charitable.
Save your breath. Get out!
l'll teach you to bother me!
Get out, you thieving bastards!
Come, Bernardo, Leone
lambs of the good Lord, come!
-Now where do we go?
-l know.
Shouldn't we be rejoicing
in our hearts?
lt's the first time Providence has
made us useful to someone else.
Father, what's bothering you?
God forgive me for
abusing your obedience. Bernardo,
l command you, on your holy vows,
to do what l ask.
l'll obey you, l will do
all you ask.
What must l do?
You must punish my pride.
l'll lie down. Step on my face and
neck, saying:
''Lie there, wretch
whose pride imposes penance
on his brothers!''
The joy in our faces is your best
answer to God.
We're beginning to love
our vocation!
Now we see by following you,
we follow God.
Thank you, brothers.
The Lord is always good to me.
How brother Ginepro returned naked
to Santa Maria degli Angeli
where the brothers had finished
building their hut.
Ah! How l long to go and preach!
Brother, this work brings you
ever nearer to God.
lf you work with your hands,
you know life deeply.
Put thought into each stone,
and each will magnify you.
What a lovely present!
What shall we do with them?
Now we need some sheep!
-Who gave them to you?
-A benefactor.
Let's put them on the altar!
At last we have bells to
call us to prayer.
We've another surprise! We've
finished our house. Come and see!
lt's a bit cramped.
Brother Ginepro, what happened?
l gave my habit to a beggar.
But you musn't give away your habit.
Didn't you tell us to help the poor?
l command you not to give away
your habit again!
How Giovanni The Simple asked
to follow Francesco,
and imitate him in
gesture and word.
Francesco, we're setting out.
Father, help me form these sons
into a new and humble people.
May this new time be like that which
saw your Son's meekness.
Let there be peace among men.
ln the name of the Lord,
go in meekness and honesty.
Pray God in your hearts, and
shun empty words and deeds.
Each one help the other.
lf you come across anyone who
needs you, forget everything else.
lf you don't help others on earth,
you can't hope for God's reward.
Brothers, take care not to waste
the most precious gift of time
nor appear lazy
in others' eyes.
l want my brothers to do honest work
and not burden others.
Make those who don't know the Gospels
learn from your example.
As Ginepro has no clothes, he
will cook you a nice dinner.
We'll bring him a silken habit.
Farewell until this evening.
-We'll spread joy!
Lord, make me an instrument
of your peace.
Let me bring love where there is hate,
unity where there is discord.
Let me bring joy where there is pain,
and hope where there is despair.
Make me love, not wish for love.
And let all on earth know the
secret of your peace
which is the fruit of justice
and fraternal charity.
Sing a little quieter.
Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed
be thy name, thy kingdom come
Little brothers, who praise God so
easily, because you fly so freely
now let me, too,
praise God in peace.
Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. So it is.
Anyone there?
What do you want, brother?
-Oh, you're beautiful!
What do you want?
To speak to your leader.
Speak to me, it's the same.
l want to join Francesco.
And the bull?
lt's for the brothers.
That's ours. Grandpa's gone mad.
We can't give away a cow.
-l'll see to the old man.
-Yes, you keep him.
Here we walk with Jesus
and the Madonna.
-Can you pray?
-l know the Hail Mary.
See how beautiful! Do you like it?
We always pray here.
-Do you like them?
-Beautiful.
The lamp is out. Well, we'll
light it tomorrow.
-What are you doing?
- The oil is beautiful.
Let us pray.
How peaceful it is.
This is where we sleep.
The fire is dying.
Beautiful fire!,
Why stint brother Fire?
l love him because he's
beautiful and strong.
Praise God for brother Sun by day
and brother Fire by night.
But father, fire can hurt you.
And you, why do you want to hurt
brother Fire?
Father, let me do it.
-Why aren't the others back yet?
-Be patient, they'll come.
l want to be like Francesco.
But why did you leave your wife
and children? Were they unkind?
No, l want to be like Francesco.
With us, you must work harder still.
Your family must be as dead to you.
You must be humble and pray.
Will it not be hard to leave your
family? What do you want of Francesco?
l want to be a saint like him.
l am Francesco!
Let's go out.
Your new brothers are returning
from a day's work.
This is our new brother.
So many gifts from God!
-Take these, Ginepro!
Sister Chiara sent this habit
for brother Ginepro. lt's been so long,
and she wants to eat with you.
May she come here?
Do you think l should let her?
So, tell sister Chiara we await her.
Here, Ginepro. God never abandons
those who serve Him.
Why are you so sad?
We are great sinners. The Lord
wouldn't grant us alms today.
Never fear, those who do their duty
will never go in want.
What our brothers brought back
is for all of us.
Look, we have a new brother!
His name's Giovanni.
Santa Chiara's wonderful meeting,
with San Francesco at
Santa Maria degli Angeli.
-We'll never do it!
-Don't worry, we have time.
Don't break the branches,
just take the flowers.
-Want to climb onto my shoulders?
-lf you steady me.
And we thought we had nothing.
Pick plenty for sister Chiara.
We're making a beautiful carpet.
Smell it!
Good. Let's prepare a house fit for
a girl consecrated to God.
Go trim your beard!
Take the buckets.
-And you?
-Father, l don't have to shave.
Now we'll clean you up.
Ack! That hurts.
-Gently, gently.
She is coming!
Sister Chiara's coming!
Hello sister Chiara!
Hello sister Chiara!
So many memories!
Sister Chiara consecrated herself to God
in this chapel.
She's beautiful.
He took my cloak!
Hush! Brother Ginepro has no clothes.
Didn't Francesco order you not to give
your habit away again?
Yes, but l met a man who begged
in God's name.
l couldn't give him this ricotta,
so l said:
''l have only this habit, and l have
sworn not to give it away
but if you take it off my back
l won't stop you.''
That's my cloak
Be charitable. He was naked,
we covered him.
Take this to a needy brother.
You take it, please.
Last night the devil visited me again.
But he went away unhorned, because
l've a simple way to drive him off,
When he's near, l rush to close
the door to my heart,
and envelop myself in
holy meditation.
So when he knocks,
l reply from within:
''Keep out, evil one, there's no room
for you here!''
Defeated, the devil leaves me,
and the land.
My God!
And the people of Assisi saw
the horizon red with fire.
They ran to Santa Maria degli Angeli
thinking it was burning.
The sky was alight with glowing words
of love from God, Chiara, and Francesco.
How brother Ginepro cut off a pig's
trotter to give to a sick brother.
l always have to stay here.
But that's fine.
One of our brothers is weak from
too much fasting.
l've made soup. Will it do him good?
Doesn't it smell good?
l doubt he can eat it,
but l'll take it to him.
Brother, l've made food
that'd raise the dead.
Thank you, brother.
ln your condition, you shouldn't fast.
Father Francesco would order you to eat.
l do not fast to mortify my flesh.
You fast too much. l know what
you would like.
A leg of chicken.
Or a trout, some sausages,
a fresh egg and ricotta.
So, what would you like?
lt'd be a big comfort if you'd
bring me a pig's trotter.
Leave it to me.
l'll go and find one.
He wouldn't eat but
he wants a pig's foot.
Where?
With God's help l'll find a pig
who'll offer me his trotter.
Give me the knife.
Let's trust in God.
Brother piglets, the Lord has sent
you to help me.
Brother pig, please listen.
You who are the most beautiful
give your succulent trotter
for a sick brother?
lt won't hurt. The Lord will help us.
Think, little brother, how rarely
we can do good!
Thank you, Lord, for the good
the pig and l can do.
You found one!
Listen, he's also thanking the Lord!
l've brought you a trotter.
What a lovely smell!
Robbers! Thieves! You cut off my pig's
leg! That's what you call doing good?
Calmly, brother. What is it?
One of you cut off my pig's leg.
-Forgive us. Did you see who did it?
-No, or l'd have cracked his skull.
You've done it again!
You're a simpleton.
But, l did something good.
What made you do such a thing?
Brother pig and l were only doing good.
The pig was happy, too, wasn't he, Giovanni?
l command you to run and beg
that man's pardon,
and promise we won't
trouble him again.
Don't be stingy with your repentence!
What a forest of hair!
A lovely forest for God!
You needn't feel sorry for
brother pig
because he helped my sick brother.
To help a sick brother!
Aren't you pleased?
Eat it, you vagabonds! But if l see
you again, l'll flay you!
l told you l'd soothed him.
We can give it to the poor!
Yes, l'll see to it.
How San Francesco, praying in the
forest at night, met the leper.
My God, my all!
God, crucified
My brothers and l love you.
Crucified
My God!
How brother Ginepro cooked
food for fifteen days
and Francesco, touched by his zeal,
gave him permission to preach.
l've got an idea!
Now that we have so much food
let's cook it all at once, then
it'll last fifteen days,
So we'll be able to go
and preach, too!
l think Francesco will be happy, too.
And also the poor.
Where will we find a big enough pot?
Ask the shepherds.
Good idea. l'll go and look, with God's help.
-And for Francesco.
Help me. Put in lots of greens.
Get the wood now.
-What are you doing?
-The wood.
No, put the vegetables in!
Ginepro, the fire is dying,
bring more wood!
Ginepro's cooking tonight.
Don't put the wood in,
you'll ruin it!
Francesco! Beautiful Francesco!
l'm making dinner for fifteen days,
so we can all go preaching.
The chicken in this soup
will nourish us,
then we can forget about meals,
we can preach!
Come here, Ginepro.
You may preach, but l command you to
begin your sermons thus:
''Baa, baa, baa, much l say,
little l do.''
For it is better to preach with
example than with words.
How brother Ginepro was
sentenced to death,
and how his humility conquered the
ferocity of the tyrant Nicolaio.
Let me have a go. Sit on the other end.
Where did you get the helmet?
Nicolaio's soldiers left it.
The tyrant is besieging Viterbo.
-Since when?
-Three months.
He's still there? l must seize
this opportunity.
He'll win again.
No, he's got less blood than l have.
-l bet he can't fill the cup.
-l bet he can.
Baa, baa, baa, much l say,
little l do.
Thank you, Lord. Finally
l understand,
that souls are won not by words,
but by example.
-What's happening?
-A game.
Let's go and watch!
What's going on?
They're having fun with a beggar.
Bring him here.
Search him.
An awl and a flint.
Beat him, then kill him.
l'll try it.
What have you done to this damned
armour? lt's digging into my neck.
Do something, you dogs!
The last time you cut off the feet
instead of the head.
Will you kill him without a priest
of his faith?
Call that one who buries the bodies.
Why a priest? He'll die, anyway.
Give him some wine instead.
Play music. He'll manage to die,
just the same.
Such a little mouse! Trying
to kill our leader!
Go away.
My son, l bring you the comfort
of our faith.
ln the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.
Who are you?
A sinner.
What sins?
Many, many!
-Where are you from?
-Assisi.
Your name?
Ginepro. Why?
Do you follow,
that Francesco who's gentle
like a mother?
And meek as a lamb.
ln God's name! l know this boy, he's
a friend of all. l'll talk to Nicolaio.
Lord Nicolaio, an injustice!
They're killing an innocent!
What's that? What do you want?
Nibbio, raise this visor!
Raise it at once!
What innocent?
The man you just condemned.
That worm threatened my life.
Nibbio, show him the instruments.
But this is to make fire, and the
awl is for mending his sandals.
A spy warned me of an assassin with
such tools, dressed like a beggar.
This is a devilish conspiracy!
No, l know him.
He is a follower of Francesco, a poor
man - the son of a rich man.
He gave everything to the poor,
and lives with companions
in a forest, free as birds.
Many follow him, because he loves
even the lowly.
He who despises the world is full of
hate, and thus, poisonous.
No, does not Aristotle say that,
he who despises the world does so
to protect himself from pain?
The poor are all the same. They preach
poverty, rob you, then slit your throat.
No! They refuse everything.
They're incapable of doing harm.
So, bring him here. l want
to question him.
Tell me, who are you?
-l'm a very great sinner.
Take off this helmet, Nibbio!
Would you betray us to Viterbo?
l'm the greatest traitor,
unworthy of anything.
Were you going to kill me with that
awl, and set fire to the camp?
l?
l'm a very great sinner.
l'd do worse things
if God didn't protect me.
lf this is Ginepro
what must Francesco be like?
See the truth in his words!
Before God, we're always guiltier
than others can tell,
because we are not grateful
to God
and because we do not love
our fellow men.
We would be even more guilty
but for the help of merciful God.
-l don't understand this talk.
Nor l. Get this armour off me!
Take him to my tent.
Sound the call!
End the siege!
How brother Francesco taught
brother Leone
what perfect happiness is.
Brother Leone, lamb of God, even if
we could make the blind see
the deaf hear, exorcise demons,
and raise the dead - this
is not perfect happiness.
Did you see? He was after my
gold, but l punished him.
Brother, is a little gold
worth a man's life?
Here, take this coin.
Rest in peace.
-Amen.
O brother Leone, lamb of God,
even if we knew the language of
the angels, the soul's secrets,
this is not perfect happiness.
Even if we could predict the future,
and know nature's secrets,
this is not perfect happiness.
Were we to convert all to Christ,
this is not perfect happiness.
Tell me, where is perfect happiness?
Oh, here's a house. Let's see if
they'll praise Christ with us!
God, in his mercy, will surely show us
where perfect happiness is.
Be charitable, brother. We poor monks
roam the world for love of others.
We'll help you serve Jesus.
Serve Jesus with us!
Go away! Stop bothering people!
Brother, be charitable!
Serve Jesus, brother!
l'll give you Jesus! Get out, thieves!
l'll be generous! l'll give you
every inch of this stick of mine!
lf you want more, come back and
disturb a man in his own house.
Brother Leone, lamb of God, now that
we've suffered all this for Christ
it is perfect happiness.
Above all the graces which Christ gives
His followers is the grace to conquer oneself
and to endure suffering for love of Him.
Only in this is perfect happiness!
How San Francesco left Santa Maria
degli Angeli with his brothers
and went through the world
to preach peace.
They're coming!
We found few people to accept our alms;
they say we're poor.
We leave our garden in your hands.
We leave you everything: oil, bread,
nuts. Not much, but all yours.
Please care for our chapel,
because we are going away to preach.
l can't come, not with this cloak.
True, apostles have no cloaks or shoes.
You've more than you need, give them away.
Happy? You need a cowl.
God bless you! l take only my faith
with me, l leave you my heart.
Farewell, brother Nightingale.
Farewell, shady brother Tree.
Farewell, blessed earth.
Farewell, little house.
Farewell, Santa Maria degli Angeli.
Some for us, some we
give to the poor.
Take everything. Even my stick.
Come here, Father.
Bring the gifts.
The Lord bless you.
Brothers, l have nothing left.
Nor have l, and l have
fifteen children.
We've given everything,
now let us thank God.
Father Silvestro, you're a priest,
say the blessing.
O my Lord, my hope is in You.
Send us help from on high!
Show us Your paths.
Teach us Your way.
Guide our steps.
Giovanni, we're waiting for you.
The time has come for us to separate
for each to go and preach alone.
Father, which way do we go?
-God will show us.
How shall we know God's will?
l command you to spin around,
like children playing,
until your head is dizzy.
Not dizzy yet?
Still not dizzy?
Now l'm dizzy!
Ah, my head's spinning!
ln which direction did you fall?
Towards Siena.
Towards Florence.
Towards Arezzo.
Towards Pisa.
Towards Spoleto.
Towards Foligno.
Where did you fall, Giovanni?
Towards that finch dancing on the trees.
Then follow that bird, and the
road the Lord has shown you.
So, my sons, spread throughout the
world and preach peace. Farewell.
