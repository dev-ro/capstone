Everyone's spinning tales,
sir, everyone's got a story.
The aim is to create fear in people.
I don't know what you mean
by spinning tales, sir,
but there are scientific facts that
everyone has to know about.
After all, isn't this how
the dinosaurs became extinct?
And aren't these meteors heading our way?
Sir, meteors are always heading our way.
It always looks as if meteors are
approaching earth, but they come and go,
What actually hits is only
a few small meteorites.
I am not making this up, sir,
this is what NASA says.
NASA comes up with all kinds of things.
You know what NASA says? We'll a
bandon earth and move to Planet Altar!
Sir we're not talking about Planet Altar,
We're talking about meteors
about to hit the earth.
If a meteor of this size hits...
This is Tavþancýk ladies and gentlemen.
According to NASA
there is a 30%% % possibility that a meteor
will hit the earth in the next 10 days.
World leaders are calling for
a UN Security Council meeting.
Now, for our next story...
That smile becomes you,
that smile becomes you.
What's up, robot? Good morning.
Good morning.
Guys, tea?
Alright.
And one for me.
Coming.
Good morning guys.
Good morning.
Tea?
Yes, I'll have one.
Ýbo, did you see these?
What are they?
Come look.
A pile of papers again.
What's all this?
Remember you were making fun of our lawsuit?
It served as a precedent in France.
Railway workers there
have won the right to strike.
Wow.
Hey robot, what are you watching?
Nothing, just looking.
Good morning Cengiz.
Oh right!
And good morning to you.
So what do we do with these flyers?
Distribute them?
Give one to everyone with their tea.
Hey guys, it's time to get to work.
Ah, there's your good morning.
Jerk!
First we say good morning.
What's the matterwith you?
Don't ask, bro, we're wrecked.
Only three of us working since last night.
And why is that?
Erol sent Mahir to Kurtköy.
Why?
I'll start.
I think the guy there got sick or something.
And we're paying the price.
Only three booths open
for the morning rush hour.
Ticket please.
Four liras.
Fourteen fifty.
Seventeen liras and fifty cents.
You fucking perv!
Every fucking day! I'll kick your ass!
My little Tolly Dolly,
you've got me all wrong.
Stop calling me that!
Ok, ok,
calm down!
You still talking?
I'll fuck you up!
Wait! Stop! Help, police!
You fucking asshole,
if I see you here again...
Hey, calm down, calm down.
You, get into your truck and leave already!
Is she off her rocker?
If I see you here again...
Look bro, a ruckus!
Some activity here, it seems?
Your ticket, sir.
Four and a half liras.
What the hell?
Did the prices go up?
Four and a half liras.
I paid two and a half only yesterday.
It was four and a half yesterday as well, sir.
Highway robbery,
that's what it is!
Ticket please?
How many axles on the ground?
Four liras.
Five liras.
Eleven liras and seventy five cents.
Yes, four liras.
Four liras.
Not just a guy,
always the same guy.
The same truck driver,
he's big, has a moustache.
The guy is crying out for the police,
and she just keeps whacking
his head, saying you asshole,
no police for you.
The booth's a coffin, I tell you.
No wonder they call it the coffin.
What coffin?
I just put on my music,
tune everything else out.
That's the way to go.
You're a machine.
You should just take and give, take and give.
No anger, no temper.
Look at the automatic booth,
does it ever lose its temper?
I swear to you,
the auto-booth is the happiest one of us.
What do you say, Robot?
It's the auto-booth and Robot.
Hey, you know if they don't go all automatic,
it'll be because of you.
How many cars did you do today?
Uh oh, system error again.
Going home, Kenan?
Home.
Why don't you come to the local with us?
We'll play cards.
No thanks. I'd better go home.
You know about my father.
How's he?
The same.
Wow, what a mad rush today!
Everyone's coming back from their holiday.
I'm dead.
It takes so little for you to die!
I'm just starting my shift.
I'll go home, prepare dinner,
put the kid to bed,
wake up, make breakfast, it's endless...
You're just back from Erol's office, aren't you?
Did he yell at you?
Girl, were you gonna kill him?
What would you have done if I didn't stop you?
What's the matterwith you,
taking on such a big guy?
I just lost it.
He's there every day, the fucker.
The same guy?
Exact same guy.
What more do you want?
He could be the one for you.
Give me a break.
The shuttle's here.
Erol says the new managing director
is coming for supervision tomorrow.
Really?
There's a new guy?
He was supervising in Kurtköy today.
Make sure you keep it together tomorrow.
Kenan?
Hey Robot, did you get that?
Starts with a T,
ends with an A.
Avegetable,
three letters.
Pea.
I said it starts with a T.
Pea.
T, I said, T.
Tea?
Didn't you say it was a vegetable?
No, I said do you want more tea?
No, I gotta go.
My dad's waiting at home.
Only your dad?
I'm going, Artun.
Alright, alright,
hang on a second.
How is your old man doing?
He's worse.
How about Nurgül?
Does she take good care of him?
They get along well.
The whole neighborhood
is talking about you and Nurgül.
Well, people talk.
They talk about this and not the meteor?
They talk about the meteor too.
So, anything there?
Good night, Artun.
Pea.
What are you doing?
I dropped my keys.
Welcome.
Hakki, you didn't eat all yourfood.
It's enough, my dear.
There's soup, do you want some?
No, I'm not hungry, thanks.
Excuse me?
Nothing.
It's late, I should go.
Hakki, where's your pill?
I have it here.
Don't forget to keep it nearby.
Alright, don't worry.
I've been meaning to ask,
I love this picture, how old are you here?
The porch light isn't working.
What?
The porch light isn't working.
The bulb must have burnt out.
Just change it.
I'll be off then.
I'll drop you off.
Don't bother, it's so close.
He'll drop you off, of course.
You never know, so late at night.
Don't watch too much TV,
and don't forget your pills, ok?
Ok dear, don't worry.
Good night.
Good night.
Thanks forwalking me.
There's no need for that Kenan, we're neighbors.
Take it.
Come on, we're like family now,
no need for that.
Nurgül.
Take it.
Thanks.
Good night.
Hayal!
Hayal!
This Nurgül.
She's a very good girl.
She takes good care of me.
Hard to find a girl like that these days.
What do you think?
About what?
Aren't you listening to me?
I'm listening to you dad.
I said Nurgül is a very good girl.
Yes, she is.
She's pretty too.
Looks like your mother.
Herwalk,
her smile...
Even her cooking.
It's the meteor on every channel.
Nothing else.
Do you have asthma?
Having difficulty breathing?
Change that bulb tomorrow.
Everyone's coming and going
in the dark because of us.
Ok dad, I'll change it.
Dad.
Dad.
Get up, dad.
Come on, get up.
Let's take you to bed.
Alright, I'll go to bed.
But I have to shave first.
You shave in the mornings anyway,
why shave every night?
Enough, let go.
Marry Nurgül.
Six liras.
Marry Nurgül.
Six liras.
8000 cars pass through our station everyday.
We monitor every one of them with cameras.
Good.
Marry Nurgül.
I am not going to answer you.
Soon you're gonna kick the bucket anyway.
Don't talk to me that way.
I was young once too.
You look at her ass.
Don't you want to grab it?
She's in front of you,
you're behind her.
Slowly you lift her skirt.
You're inside her, pumping.
She yells your name.
Kenan.
Kenan.
Kenan.
Kenan, Kenan, Kenan!
Enough.
Stop it! Stop!
Enough, shut up!
Enough!
What the...
Call him over.
Kenan, to the tower immediately!
Turn on the red light and
come to the tower immediately.
This is an international transit point, sir.
8000 cars pass through this station every day.
Why don't we dispense with
our respectability entirely,
and have our attendants wear
straitjackets for a uniform?
Sir, Kenan's father is very ill.
He's going through tough times.
No, sir.
I cannot have him working at this station.
This station is the showcase of our operation.
Come in. Come in, Kenan.
Have a seat.
How is everything at home?
Is yourfather ok?
Kenan, I am going to be brief.
I can't have you working in such a busy station
when yourfather's condition is so dire.
I am aware that more staff is needed here.
But I'm going to send you to a station where...
...you can work more comfortably.
How is that?
Which station?
Afar.
Afar?
Yes, Afar.
Only three orfour cars a day.
So don't get off here tomorrow,
stay on the shuttle. Get off at Afar, ok?
And the person working there can come here.
Erol, you'll take care of the paperwork, right?
Yes sir.
Good. Do we have a deal, Kenan?
As you see fit, sir.
Good. Go on then, turn on the red light,
shut down your booth here.
Take it easy now.
They've transferred me to Afar,
as of tomorrow.
You mean you'll take Ahmet's post?
Ahmet?
Did you have a fight with somebody or something?
No.
Apparently I should not be working in...
...such a busy station when my father's so ill.
And how does he know about yourfather?
Damn, so many cars!
Ýbrahim bring me a tea, will you?
Kenan's been transferred.
Really?
Where?
Afar.
I'm starting there tomorrow.
So they're banishing you.
You'll take Ahmet's place?
Who's this Ahmet?
Forget about Ahmet.
They're sending you to the holiday resort...
of this job. Go there, turn your TV on,
put yourfeet up and relax.
He changed it.
First, how do you know it was him?
And second, what if he did?
You don't get it, Artun.
There's nothing to get.
Don't be so uptight.
And anyway, where would you
find a light bulb at this hour?
It's the same story since I was a kid.
First he tells me to do something...
...and then goes and does it
before I get around to it.
Ok, so he told you to take care of it.
Did you buy a light bulb then?
How would he know that I didn't?
He knows that you wouldn't be able to.
He knows what time you leave work.
He knows the shops will be closed.
He knows all that.
It's the same story since I was a kid.
First he tells me to do something...
...and then goes and does it before
I get around to it. It's too hot in here.
Kenan.
Bro, you ok?
What do you mean?
Don't know,
your eyes are look strange.
I'm ok.
You look pale.
No, I'm alright.
Kenan, are you sick or something?
I'm not.
It's just that I can't sleep.
Why?
I can't.
There's something I'm working on at night.
Never mind.
At night?
Artun, you have no idea
how he insists on doing the same thing.
The same story since I was a kid,
over and over again.
First he tells me to do something...
...then he goes and does it
himself before I get around to it.
Apricots.
Apricots.
Apricots.
Apricots.
Apricots.
Apricots, you idiot,
apricots!!
Welcome Kenan.
What are you watching?
It's a game show.
The idiot has spent two jokers for the question,
what is Amasya famous for...
...and he still can't get it right.
Apples.
Apples, my ass!
It's apricots.
Dad that's Malatya,
Amasya is famous for its apples.
I am not senile yet.
I say the same thing,
but he gets furious.
I should get going.
Hakki, anything you want from me?
No darling,
thanks.
Good night.
Good night.
How was your day?
Fine.
They've transferred me.
Oh, great!
Where?
The Afar exit.
Any increase in your pay?
No, the same.
Only difference is that I'll get home later.
I'll let you know tomorrow,
when I have a better sense of the schedule.
Don't worry,
my house is just around the corner anyway.
They transferred me today.
Where?
Afar.
Dad, can we move into staff housing?
No, we can't.
I'm going to have to
commute three hours every day.
The answer is no.
Dad, it's been 25 years since mom died.
No.
I'm on my way out anyway,
then you can do whatever you want.
You ingrate!
I'll be gone soon,
then you can do whatever, sell it or burn it.
The porch light is fixed.
I know.
I fixed it.
Dad, I told you yesterday that I'd fix it.
Oh for God's sake,
as if you've everfixed anything in your life!
And if it is not asthma,
go see a doctorfor your breathing.
No dad, I'm fine.
Good.
Let's take a quick tour
before your mother catches us.
Welcome. Mustafa.
No, it's Kenan.
Excuse me?
My name is Kenan.
No, I'm Mustafa.
Welcome.
Thank you.
You'll be alright,
this place is easy.
There's no tower here?
No.
We're connected to Samandira.
So you're alone here?
Yes. But it's better.
You get used to it.
Turn on your TV, read a book, do your thing.
What about security?
No such thing.
Anyway, it's always the same people
who pass through.
The transmitter...
Come with me.
Cemil.
Is that you, Mustafa?
Cemil, do you hear me?
Is that you, Mustafa?
Yeah it's me.
Look, the new guy's here, his name is...
Kenan.
His name is Kenan,
he'll say hi to you now.
Help him out if there's a problem.
Yes. I will.
Hello.
Welcome, bro.
Thanks.
So that's that.
If you have a question, ask Cemil.
The shuttle comes back in 8 hours.
You just hand in the cash
and the report to the driver.
The transmitter's volume comes and goes.
Oh and, Cemil is a little weird,
don't mind him.
That's just the way he is.
God bless.
Ticket please.
Hey, you're not the same guy.
Right, your ticket please.
So you're not the one I saw here yesterday.
I'm not, sir. Ticket?
You'll get the ticket, man.
You'll get it, but where did I put it...
Phew!
You know I always think I won't find it.
Can you please find it?
You know what, my friend?
I hate it here. I hate it!
Sir, you still haven't given me your ticket.
You know, when you first see her, you say
she's meant for me, you know.
She's the one!
How old are you?
- Thirty five.
- How old?
Thirty five.
Wow, you're old!
You look younger.
Can I have the ticket?
Didn't I give it to you?
No, sir.
You really got me chatting...
Where are we?
- We're not there yet.
- Where are we?
Dude, how much is it?
- Where are we?
- How much?
Thirteen liras.
- Help! Help!
- Shut up!
Do something!
Help me!
How much is it, bro?
Thirteen.
Save me from this scumbag!
Please!
Shut up!
Stop staring and do something!
Help me!
Dad?
Hello!
Hello.
My car just broke down, can you help?
Sorry about this.
No problem.
Beautiful car.
My father had the same model.
It's broken down for the third time this morning.
Do you want to give it a try?
What?
Do you want to try?
Ok.
It may work if you push it a little.
That's how it started this morning.
Ok.
Thank you!
Same time tomorrow.
Hello.
How much?
Let me have your ticket sir.
My what?
I need see your ticket
to tell you how much it costs.
The trick is to tell me without looking at my
ticket.
Then you'll have to pay for the longest distance.
And why is that?
That's the rule.
And what if I don't pay?
Then you can't pass, sir.
God damn me.
Hey bro!
You think you can stop me, huh?
You think you can stop me?
I'll note down your license plate.
You'll pay the longest distance
as penalty fee, how's that?
Ok then, how much is it?
So you don't have a ticket.
Thirteen liras.
I have my ticket.
Then give it to me!
How much?
Just a second.
How much?
Just a second.
Seven liras.
Seven liras?
Artun!
Fucking hell!
What's your problem?
Are you leaving?
Yes.
They transferred me.
Really, where?
Afar.
Afar.
Great.
Should we go down to the coast?
Ok, sure.
Were you talking to yourself again, Kenan?
Only three people passed through all day.
Maybe it's for the better.
Quieter.
Awoman passed through today.
What's that supposed to mean?
Awoman passed?
Three people and one woman passed?
Does the woman count as one of the three?
Quit it!
As if this is an official report:
3 people passed, 1 woman passed.
You know what I mean, a woman passed through.
I know what?
You and your Tarzan talk.
Woman. Pass.
Awoman. Passed.
Awoman passed through the station today.
Her car broke down, and I helped her.
Wow, so you flirted with her.
You really flirted with her!
I didn't flirt with her.
You did, you did!
So what did you do?
She passed through and you stared?
You stared.
I bet she must be crazy about you already.
And how exactly did you stare?
Just like that, like you're staring at the black
train!
She'll pass through again, same time tomorrow.
What time is that?
Ten twenty.
Ten twenty?
Ten twenty!
So punctual, she must be English!
Yes at ten twenty.
She'll pass through same time tomorrow,
what's so funny?
Ten twenty.
I was just leaving.
Let me walk you.
No, really, no need this time.
I'll go.
Good night.
Good night.
Kenan.
Why don't we go for tea sometime?
You'll get some fresh air.
My father shouldn't be left alone.
He wanted us to go.
I mean, he said it.
Would you rather not?
Fine, we'll go.
I mean, I'm just saying because
yourfather suggested it. If you don't...
It's fine, whatever.
I don't know,
I thought it would be good for you too.
There's an egg sandwich for you in the kitchen.
Dad.
Dad.
What did you tell Nurgl?
What did I tell what?
What did you tell Nurgl?
About what?
Did you tell her that we should go out?
I told her you should go out.
She takes care of me all day here,
she needs a bit of fresh air.
Why are you doing this, dad?
Don't make a big deal about everything.
It's just tea.
Kemal.
Cemil?
Who the hell is Kemal?
This is Kenan.
Cemil, is that you?
Cemil do you hear me?
This is Kenan.
So it's already time?
Excuse me?
Yesterday you said you'd be here the same time.
Yes, I said so.
And here I am.
Thank you very much.
For yesterday.
I didn't want to stop the car
in case I couldn't start it again.
No, it's fine, you did the right thing.
You're new here, aren't you?
Yes, I started yesterday.
I would have remembered you otherwise.
Up the road...
further on...
I go through here every morning around this time.
And I'm here too. Always.
If you'd like...
Excuse me?
I can take your ticket if you'd like?
- I didn't give it to you?
- No you didn't.
I was wondering...
Kemal!!
What was that?
Kemal!!
Stop it.
Who's shouting?
The transmitter,
it's from the tower...
Dude, you there?!!
Your tower really shouts loudly.
So your name is Kemal?
No, it's Kenan.
He thinks it's Kemal.
Something's wrong with the transmitter,
the volume comes and goes.
Hey, honeybunny
you there?!!
Cemil, give me five minutes!
Why is that?
I'm talking to a customer.
Anyway, don't let me hold you up any longer.
Not at all!
Ten liras.
Have a good day.
Have a good day.
See you same time tomorrow, Kemal.
Kenan.
My name is Kenan.
What do you mean talking to a customer, man?
You think you own rhat booth?
We're civil servant here.
Cemil, what is it you want?
Let me know when you arrive
in the mornings and leave in the evenings.
That's what you've been banging on about?
- What?
- Is thatwhy...
- Can't hear you.
- Forget it.
- Justforget it.
- Can't hear you.
What are you doing?
You came back?
What are you doing with them,
one by one, so meticulously?
I'm bored,
I'm putting them in order.
You're very neat.
I'm very bored.
You didn't ask my name.
Right, I didn't.
What's your name?
Hüseyin.
Excuse me?
My name is Hüseyin.
Why are you asking?
How long have you been here?
Excuse me?
How long have you been here?
You alright, bro?
I'm sorry.
Can I have your ticket?
Yourface is chalk white.
I'm fine, I was just lost in thought.
Your ticket please.
I have a question before I give it to you.
Is this the way to Hasanlar?
Who?
Is this the exit for the Hasanlar village?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know,
aren't you a toll booth attendant?
I am a toll booth attendant, and I don't know,
sir.
I won't go through if this is not the exit.
Sir, I just started working here,
and I don't know how to get there.
Why me?
Why is it always me?
Can't you ask someone?
Just a second.
Cemil!
Cemil!
Listening.
This is Kenan.
Tell me, honeybunny.
There is a gentleman here,
he wants to know how to get to Hasanlar.
Look, if this is not the exit,
I won't go through.
Get to who?
Hasanlar village,
he's asking if this is the exit.
Just tell him it is.
This is the exit he says.
Ok.
How do I get there?
He wants to know the way.
Cemiil! He wants to know the way.
Tell him to make a right,
make a left, whatever dammit.
We're not the information desk here. He shouldn't
get on the road if he doesn't know the way.
Go straight, take the first right...
Alright brother,
I heard it, thanks,
I heard it.
Sir!
Sir, you didn't pay!
Cemil!
Cemil!
Don't call me honeybunny ever again!
You opened the door...
Shhh, yourfather's sleeping, be quiet.
Let me get my sweater and we'll go out.
Go out?
You were going to take me out for tea?
Alright.
Won't take me a moment.
What if he wakes up and panics
that we're not around?
Not possible, he knows that
we were going out for tea.
He kept talking about it all day.
So, where are you kidnapping me to?
You haven't thought about it?
Let's go to the coast,
so that we can walk a little.
Ok.
Excuse me?
Ok, let's go.
Welcome, what would you like?
I'd like a coffee, no sugar.
You?
Ok.
What's ok, coffee?
I'll have coffee.
Sugar?
Sugar.
Ok then, two coffees with sugar.
No, one without sugar, one with.
No, two with sugar.
Alright.
He's so obnoxious!
It's too hot.
Just this short walk and I'm drenched.
You know, they say the meteor's coming.
Who knows why it would want to come here?
Yes they say it's coming.
What are you looking at?
So cute!
Hello handsome,
what are you doing there?
Cutie pie.
So, Kenan.
How are you, fine?
I'm fine.
Come on, tell me about yourwork.
My work?
There isn't much to tell.
Ok, so do you guys just sit there all day?
Yes.
But sometimes we go out for a smoke.
All day, in the midst of all the fumes.
Can't do without cigarettes.
I mean you sit there all day
in the midst of all the fumes?
Yes we sit.
And then?
And then...
...well, the car comes.
We take the ticket.
Scan it.
Scan it with what?
There is a scanner.
It scans.
We tell the driver how much it costs.
You say how much it costs?
Yes, we do.
Then, we take the money.
Give back the change, the car goes.
Then another car comes.
Yes. Then...
Here is your coffee.
Enjoy.
Thank you.
Then, it's all the same, really.
Excuse me,
I'll use the facilities.
Don't shout.
Look uncle's angry with you.
Uncle, aren't you angry with him?
He's in a mood.
So, the days go by.
It's too hot, no?
Kenan, you don't look well these days.
You look pale.
Take care of yourself,
get some sleep.
I'm not taking it, don't be silly.
Oh by the way,
I saw what you're hiding under the bed.
Are you trying to fix yourfather's car?
Did you go in to my room?
Yes, to tidy it up.
- Didn't I tell you not to go in to my room?
- But it was very messy.
I told you not to go into my room.
I'm sorry,
I didn't realize you would get so angry.
Don't look at me that way!
Don't look at me!
When you were a kid,
what did you want to be?
As a kid?
A toll booth attendant?
Come on, what did you want to be?
A knight.
A knight!
You wanted to be a knight?
Yes I was going to grow up to be a knight.
Why didn't you then?
I must have been about five or six.
My father took us to Bodrum.
It was a very yellow day.
So yellow that the sun
didn't let you open your eyes.
There is a castle in Bodrum, a large one.
I was ecstatic when I saw it.
The heyday of my knighthood,
you know.
I insisted we go to the castle.
My father, my mother and me.
My motherwas riddled with cancer.
Anyway, we went to the castle.
I'm in seventh heaven.
Finally I'll get to see the knights.
What were you going to
tell them when you saw them?
We go to the castle...
...my mother's not well enough
to climb the stairs.
So she's gonna wait downstairs.
I can't stay still,
I'm jumping around.
Just as we get to the gate...
...as we're about to go in...
...my mother holds my arm,
pulls me towards her.
Kenan, she says, listen to me.
I'm so excited to see the knights that
I don't know what to do with myself.
I look at her to see what she'll say.
There are no more knights, she says.
They died centuries ago.
I say, no, there are knights.
Kenan, she says,
knights are no more, they're dead.
I break free of her grip,
run up into the castle.
My father's behind me.
I'm looking all over the place.
Overgrown weeds everywhere,
everything in ruins. No sign of knights.
I keep looking, crying.
Just as I was about to lose all hope,
we went into the tower.
I step in and I see lightning!
Tens of knights are fighting,
their armor shining like lightning.
I break free of my father's grip
and run down towards my mother.
I find her. I say, mom, there are knights
upstairs.
She says no son, they're dead.
Mom, I say, please come, they're upstairs,
I'll show you.
She says, no, they don't exist.
I'm so frustrated,
I start to cry.
At that point my father comes down.
Hayal, he says.
My mother looks at him.
And he says: There are knights upstairs.
That day there were knights there.
It's the last holiday...
...I rememberwith the two of them.
And anyway, a week later...
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Why didn't you go to work?
I'm late, dad.
You're late?
Yes dad, I'm late.
You have this one shitty job and you're late to
it.
The only thing you have to do
is be there on time, you moron.
Go sleep at work!
All you do is sit there all day anyway.
Gnawing away at state money.
You're useless!
- Dad!
- Don't shout!
Don't shout!
How dare you shout at yourfather?
You shameless prick.
Who are you to shout at me? Who?
Give me 10, I give back 7,
cut your ticket push the button.
Give me 20, I give back 16,
cut your ticket, push the button.
Give me 50, I give back 46,
cut your ticket, push the button.
This is who I am, dad.
I am a toll booth attendant.
Where have you been?
I overslept.
It's noon man,
you dumped three hours on me.
I'm really sorry.
Did a white car pass through?
What?
An old white car,
did it pass through?
Look, if it ever happens again,
I'm taking it to Erol.
You dumped three hours on me.
You dumped three hours on me.
I'll dump them back.
How great.
Did a white vintage car pass through?
How great.
Bro!
Hey, bro!
Are you ok?
I was lost in thought,
sorry, your ticket please.
You're very tired.
You're tired.
Seven and a half liras.
I'm very tired too.
I've been at the wheel for 13 hours.
What's your name?
Kenan.
Kenan?
My nephew's name is Kenan too.
You're very tired.
I'm very tired too.
I've been at the wheel for 13 hours.
Move on sir, don't wait here.
Am I causing a traffic jam?
You are very tired.
I am very tired too.
Sir, if you're tired, go up ahead,
pull over on the right and rest there.
Don't wait here, ok?
Come on, move on.
Then I should pull over on
the right up ahead and wait?
If you don't mind.
God bless.
It was my first week in the army,
I had just arrived and was already a week late.
The commander told me
I wasn't allowed my weekend leave.
I said fine, I'll stay in the barracks and read.
There is a telephone.
Five minutes later a guy calls...
It's all the same,
everything is the same!
What's the same Kenan?
The people who pass through,
they're all the same.
Kenan, are you ok?
I told you I was preparing something.
- Yes.
- I did it.
You did what?
I did it,
I fixed it.
Yourfather's car?
I fixed it.
Kenan!
I was just about to leave.
Walk Nurgül home and come back immediately.
We have to talk.
Kenan.
Kenan.
I didn't tell him anything.
What didn't you tell him?
I swear to you I didn't tell him.
What didn't you tell him?
About the car.
I swear I didn't...
What did you do with the car?
You think I don't know
what you're up to every night?
What did you do with the car?
Where is it?
Don't yell!
What did you do with the car?
I sold it,
I sold the carfor parts.
I'm gonna get the hell out.
What?
I'm gonna get the hell out of here!
God damn you!
God damn you!
No, god damn you!
No, god damn you!
God damn you!
God damn you!
Dad?
Good morning.
Are you ok?
I'm fine.
You don't look it.
Stop there!
Stop here.
Are you ok?
I'm fine.
Fine.
Sorry I wasn't here yesterday.
Are you ok?
I'm fine.
Fine.
I... I can...
I can come with you now.
My father's gone.
Nurgül, she told him.
Calm down!
Calm down!
What are you doing?
I can come with you now.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Open the door.
Open it!
Open the door!
Do you know the way to the toll booth?
How do I get from here
to the toll booth, do you know?
Is it back there?
What does that mean?
Is it that way?
Tell me.
Is it back there?
What do you mean?
What do you mean, man, what?
Do you know the way to the toll booth?
Tell me.
What are you doing?
What's that?
Fuck.
Erol.
Erol.
Kenan! Kenan!
Erol.
Kenan! Here Kenan, look at me!
Erol!
Where am I?
Have some water.
I don't want any.
Kenan, you're in the tower.
Cemil heard you yelling.
You had left your booth.
They found you walking and talking to yourself.
I could go back to my booth.
She'll come at ten twenty.
You're on leave for a week.
Don't come tomorrow.
Ten twenty, she promised,
she'll come at ten twenty.
He's stuck on ten twenty.
I can work, please send me back to my booth.
My shift is not over yet.
Kenan, go home and rest.
You're on leave for a week,
don't come tomorrow.
Don't send me home please.
Let me go to the booth.
Come on, it's ok now.
Go rest.
Don't send me home.
Please let me go to my booth. I can work.
It's ok now, just rest for a while,
you'll come back, let's go now.
