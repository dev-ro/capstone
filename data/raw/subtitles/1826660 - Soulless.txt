ÄÓÕLESS
SOULLESS
My name is Max
I'm 29 years old.
For everyone 
I'm the life master.
To be more specific I'm a top manager
at the Department of Credit
in the major Russian-French
bank "Megapolis".
I'm kind of 
a hooker,
tacking between the high
demands of the management,
their own indolence
and the stupidity of their employees.
My client is my management department
And I am considered to be one of the best
players in the team and my annual revenue 
is a cute amount in euro with five zeros.
My life is a success.
And here's the office.
The tower of Mordor -
the homeland of the worldwide
corporate evil.
The Golden Calf craves for more and more 
fresh blood sacrifices.
The Mayan priests were puppies
compared to the mid-level managers.
The severed heads are piling up
t the foot of the pyramids,
but no one notices it anymore
You wanted me.
According to the smell -
vodka, sauna and whores.
It's hard, Conrad,
You're not 19 anymore, not even 40.
Alcohol is no longer corporate.
Hello, son.
- Hello, Aleksey.
Sit down.
I was at the hospital yesterday.
My tests are bad.
So in a month or two I will...
- Aleksei Alekseevich!
Retire. I wish for the last time 
to do something big, something worth.
A huge project, you know what I mean?
I see. 
You need increased credit indexes.
Your retirement depends on it.
Not really.
- For example...
Construction of houses, a village - 
"Millionaires' paradise".
The developers consolidated the land, 
they bought two state farms,
military part...
They intend to build 
wonderful houses here. 
I think that this will be 
the hit of the sales.
Another one ghetto for the privileged. 
- What?
How will be the credit ensured? 
- With the land, on which all of this will be built. 
It's risky.
- In this area
one acre is on the price of a bag with the gold. 
There are no risks.
Excuse me
Am I interrupting?
Alen Garrido - vice-president 
from the French side.
He claims he's been working  
at big European banks, but he's not specifying. 
Here since Peter I 
bastards have been invited.
He's mocking the barbarians, but he's bringing
a visit card of a sado-masochistic brothel.
Did you say something, Max? 
- I am proud of working 
with you in a team. 
- Good.
I enjoy it too. 
And this - is it 
a new project of our bank?
Nothing specific, monsieur Garrido.
It's unlikely to have something in common
with your department.
Here's the real art. 
The fashionable Moscow - 
a vanity fair.
The so called "high society". 
the venue of the supposedly strong,
supposedly rich and supposedly famous.
Terarium!
Who's the handsome guy? 
- This one?
Max Andreev - Ìàêñ Àíäðååâ - from an orphanage. 
I studied with him in the Academy. 
Mrs Suvorova!
Who am I seeing?
Alyona. As a child
she was a good girl, 
and in the university - the smartest student. 
Then she went to work in the Middle East.
Now she is a cunning shark 
in the seeking of the greater love.
How did you get here?
- Actually I am here on business, 
what are you doing here?
- I love modern art. 
You would like to jump right in the high society,
do you?
Why are you treating me like this?
- And why are you so arrogant?
Quickly!
Look, your new purchase has arrived! 
You look like you are about to burst into tears. 
- My feet are killing me.
It's me third event for today. 
Give me a kiss.
Wait, Max!
Don't bother me.
Do you believe it,
my producer told me 
that pregnancy will be an exellent 
way of promoting!
Like I am his aquarium. 
Get fat, give birth, feed... 
I think a few pounds 
on your butt would be a good idea. 
What? What do you have against 
my butt, ha? Animal! 
It's untouchable. 
Maxim Evgenich! 
- In 15 minutes.
Hello.
- Hi.
Maxim Evgenich, the documents 
on the project "Millionaires' Paradise". 
Thank you, Katya.
We're working, working...
Damn it!
Parhomenko!
The project must be presented in the most 
attractive way. What do you think?
When?
- On the conference
of the regional affiliates. 
- But this is in... 
I just found out
the decision of the management. 
Ask for the developers' materials. 
One more thing - Norman is coming. 
Alone?
- No. And he is With the plane.
Now yout how important it is?Ðàçáðà ëè âàæíîñòòà?
Get busy! We are working, gentlemen. 
And just try making a mistake.
I just thought that 
you might want to use your contacts and connections.
He comes at the end silent.
- Can you believe it?
This is pathology. Òîâà âå÷å å ïàòîëîãèÿ.
Is it so hard to moan? 
Enough... Everyone will get drunk 
and start calling the dealer. 
My nose hurts. 
Let's have one silent night
Ok?
- Stop it. What is wrong with you? 
I just promised the boys that 
I will meet them. 
Salmon. 
- I thought you liked clams. 
Then why are you ordering them 
all the time?
Because everybody will be mocking me
if I order wieners. 
Just look at them. They look 
like they ran away from the circus. 
Good afternoon. 
Sanitation control.
I am sorry, what documents? 
- It's all right. Guys, come in. Let's see. 
I'll bring them, wait here. 
- We will inspect the area. 
Where are you going? Young man! 
Attention! The gorging ones! 
We say NO to the genocyde
of the furry animals!
I you want a leather jacket,
try and go against a crocodile! 
The chinchilla is not a rat... 
it's a human. 
Take off the blond's scalp 
for a coat!
Fucking fagots!
Fucking freaks!
Do they fucking understand 
what they're fucking doing?
What are you giggling, jerk? 
Is it funny?
Do you know how much this costs? 
- What do you care?
You haven't paid for it. 
- I paid
with my presence in your life! 
Yu pig!
I would like to note that
your presence costs me a bit too much. 
What? Don't play like you are 
the fooled sponsor. Fuck! 
Come on, no need for that! 
You wanna fuck a star 
and get for free 
in the daily magazines, fucking right?
A dime a dozen like you on the Red Square!
Scrooge!
Elvira just demolished 
Darwin's theory.
According to her nowadays
survives not the strongest,
but the one whose phiz appears
most often among the glamour.
And I had another 
brilliant idea
and I figured out how to break up.
That hurts! What are you fucking doing?
Have you lost your mind? 
Get the fuck out of here! Fagot! 
Asshole! Bastard! Impotent! 
Squit!Íèùîæåñòâî!
I hate you! Fucking goat! 
My secretary - Katya.
Android.
She works connected to the mains electricity. 
If you turn her off, you will arouse 
a bug in her software.
Her memory will be erased 
and she will be off for a month.
 Going home she goes to standby
and she absorbes information only from 
the women's magazines.
A, Max!
- Yes?
I found out what a "mole" means. 
- Oh yeah? What? 
"Mole" is an agent operating 
against his own organization.
Excuse my curtness
What is your problem?
You want the place of Condratiev? Please.
Let's go to the club.
We will hook up with a girl, 
we'll have some cocaine...
Come one. You only live once. 
No. Merci, Ìàx.
I don't do drugs.
Come one. Everything is written on your face. 
You'll get Condratiev's place some other time.
Abortion. 
You are an abortion. 
Alyona! Bon Soir! 
- Who am I seeing!
It seems that we started to meet really often.
And it seems to me that you started taking drugs. 
By the way, do know who you will fuck today already? 
By the way, this is no longer your concern. 
Relax, Max.
Someone is calling you.
Misha!
Who is this beauty? 
I'll try. 
Come here.
God damn it!
There's nothing decent left in people.
Everyone want the loot.Money!
The cocain goes for 200 greens per gram. 
I give money for ten. 
I bring it, draw - eight. 
Moscow drives me mad! 
Misha! Everything went out here! 
Take it, carefully. 
- Thank you.
Can you tell me
what is everyone happy about?
Same shit,Åäíè è ñúùè ëàéíà,
same dancing, music, same drinks. 
I've been in this club all my life. 
I'm sick of all this,
and they are always enjoying, 
dancing, drinking. 
So you decided that you 
are done with clubs?
Just the opposite. 
I am opening a new one. Here, in Moscow. 
Furniture from Italy, 
Japaneese designer.
I invested more than two millions. 
And all fall apart.
Why is that?
- My partner screwed me over.
A month before the opening 
he withdrew the money, 600 grand in green. 
Now we run by stung
looking for money.
There's my partner.
Next to the ginger, at the end. Sanya! 
They don't want to invest? 
Yeah, right! Volunteer as many as you want.
Can you see the boys behind me? 
They long for in, 
to make a sauna here with hookers 
and shoot me,
to take it all from me. You know what I mean? 
Max, it's time
to start our lives. 
Does this mean to move in 
and live in the club? 
Yes, Max! You won't wake up 
on Monday at 8 am
and you will weat this costume 
only on the Halloween night.
You will make much more. 
Much more, Max!
This is over profitable business. 
Think about it!
Oxana... 
Oxana...Oxana.
Oxana, don't go too far. 
I'll call you a cab. 
Misha Voodoo opens a new club. 
He offered to invest 20% share. 
Misha Voodoo to you? 
Suddenly he became so nobel.
Vadya, quick being a jerk, 
it's not corporate. 
I don't have the money anyway. 
- How much do you need? 
1600-1700,
I have only 300.
I spent too much for a chick. 
Give yourself a credit with zero interest. 
- Yeah, you're so witty! 
For Maxim Evgenievich. 
We need to meet. 
- We'll meet. 
Maxim Evgenievich, Parhamenko 
brought a disc with the presentation, 
to see it. 
The conference starts in ten minutes. 
Don't forget 
to take it with you. 
My secretary just told me 
you called.
I know you are not in the room, 
because there was nobody there at all.
I see. What is this idiot joke?
The conference starts in two minutes. 
Hello, Max. 
You are late for the conference. 
Be careful, Max. 
It's a shame you didn't see it,
everything is beautiful there. 
Nature, bous. 
- Bravo, Parhomenko,
I never doubted you. 
You'll place it on my sign. 
So. I am glad to announce 
that the rate of cashless payments...
What a man. 
Hi, handsome.
Hello, Natalia Victorovna. 
You are georgeous. Glad to see you. 
I read in the magazines about you. 
You are so popular.
Working on that. 
Natalia - a Deputy Director 
Of Petersburg's affiliate.
I fuck her when I go to Peter. 
Pathologically greedy .
She drags me to some botiques trying to 
make me buy her all of them. 
There's interesting stuff in it.
...and we are not thinking of stoping.
Our bank needs 
new bright projects...
The guys and I decided to go 
bowling afterwards.
Want to come with us? 
Of course. 
Thank you for inviting me. 
I haven't played bowling for years. 
...the golden voice and I am not affraid to say 
that he is Orpheus in his work.
Maxim Evgenievich Andreev 
will tell you
çà åäèí òàêúâ ñòðàòåãè÷åñêè,
emphasizing, strategic project. 
Thank you, Aleksei Alekseevich, 
Everyone is madly curious 
what kind of project is that. 
Together with the company 
of developing "Galion"
we are working on a construction project 
for a villa complex in premium class - 
"Millionaires' Paradise".
Here's how it will look like. 
pay attention to the screen. 
For now this is just a piece of 
pristine nature
which is very close to the city 
in one of the high positioned and prestigious regions, 
in an ecologically perfect area. 
There is no doubt 
about the full liquidity of the project
even still on the development phase.
This pieceful area will be
a wonderful safe haven from the urban vanity. 
The houses, built with the latest technologies
applied from the West, 
unconditionally will become 
the hit of the sales.
Roughly said, we will launch it 
on the whole market.
We cannot treat seriously 
a project with such visualization. 
I don't think we will discuss
the project right now. 
There was a problem.
I couldn't finish.
The value of the land covers 
the credit 1,5 times.
The media is already writing 
about "Millionaires' Paradise" 
as some kind of miracle near Moscow. 
There are hundreds of people coming at the offices  
even before the sales has started. 
Any other bank would participate 
gladly in this project and it will win 
and we will lose 
because of our caution. 
I didn't have this information,
I didn't know about the media...
Monsieur Norman said  
that he liked the project. 
He thinks that whatever the risk is,
it will be covered by the profit from the project, 
that the bank will earn. 
He likes the provocative advertising 
but the animals are too much.
Useless fucker!
Seconhand condom!
Where did you get the video from? 
- This isn't our disc. Here's ours. 
Then where the fuck the fucking hippos came from?
Who can do that 
when you gave the disc only five minutes 
before the presentation started?
- I am sorry, Maxim, I really don't know 
who swaped the discs.
I didn't ...
Monsieur came in couple of times... 
- Garrido.
He either did that by himself, 
or he sent someone. Try and prove it!
Rumour has it 
the "Millionaires' Paradise" 
is the eight wonder  of the world and there are queues of people 
at the offices with cases full of money. It's all over the internet.
And the day after tomorrow all of this  
wil be in the newspapers.
Do you understand?
- Yes.
I can't take it anymore. 
- Shut up!
 The group "Colors"- street bullies
or fighters for justice?
The next meeting of the group Ïîðåäíàòà ñðåùà íà ãðóïèðîâêàòà
will take place today in "Quarter 44" at 9 pm.
I am here because of a disinfestation.
I have cockroaches. 
If the bugs are in your head,
the desinfestation won't help. 
I would like to explain.
- And I would like to introduce myself. 
Julia.
- Julia!
Yes, hello.
- Maxim.
So...
19-years-old.
A student in third year... 
No! Second.
You got in from the second time 
but you did it all by yourself. 
A girl coming from a decent family,
with a rich inner world,
no bad habits, a vegeterian. 
Believes in freedom and the free will
as well as the fact that she can make the world
become a better place.  
Speels higging a Teddy bear. 
- So, what...
Maxim -
30-years-old, a banker,
weak, greedy, arrogant, 
shrewish, vulgar. 
Ever since you were a kid 
you wanted to reach high level status
and you are confident that you did - 
appartment, car, credit card. 
But despite all your efforts your life 
seems to be monotonous and dull.
You want more and more entertainment. 
Any problems?
- Avdeyushka!
Avdeyushka, let me intrduce you to Max. 
He will finance our actions. 
Excuse me, what is your name? 
- Maxim.
Look, Maxim, the thing is 
that our actions 
that you are planning to finance 
are not for stock exchange.
And we are not searching for our rows
an office plankton. 
Why not?
Because you are corrupt and clueless, limited. 
- Avdeyushka, can I have a minute? 
You can. Are you nuts? 
What if he's a cop? What is wrong with you? 
Think of what you are saying and to who you're saying it. 
- Till when, huh?
Till when what? 
- Maybe I will decide for myself 
who I communicate with. Is it clear? 
- Decide by yourself, fine. 
But you don't need to tell each scavenger and freak what we are doing. 
He's not a freak. I like him! 
He seems to have a potential. 
Full pants of potential! 
You'll make me cry now!
Is this your organization? 
What will happen if you get caught? 
- It will be better
than sit and watch
people turning into degenerates, 
capable of only earning and spending.
Earning money
isn't that simple, you know.
Fighting for justice
isn't that simple too. You should try it. 
Come on!
Hello?
- Well...hello to the banker.
Look at that! Julia! 
How unexpected!
I've been thinking
this story with that disc of yours
is somehow unjust.
French came across Adveev, 
we didn't have time and we didn't check it.
In a word - I am sorry.
Ok. Than you owe me one. Let's meet. 
I love walks in the night.
Hello...
- Yes, I'm here.
When do you want to meet me? Where?
In an hour, on "Kutuzovska" street. 
- I'll be there.
Why are you standing? Jump in. 
Here, take it. You'll shoot. 
Hold it tight.
Did you get everything? 
What's up, Stass? 
- Turn it on! Five seconds. 
Done.
- Yes!
Start filming! Do you see the building? 
- I see it, Avdeev.
What do we want to say? 
We think people stopped 
living real life
and they trade it off...
with meaningless and ruthless 
chasing of trends, brands
and other shit. There! 
I would also like to say
that money is nonsense. 
Everyday you spend it 
for flushing down the toilet.
You work for earning one point.
Everyday you flush your life
down the toilet.
You just shit on it. 
Cops! Let's get out of here! 
Stop!
- Where to? Stop!
I'll take the camera. 
Go.
Thank you for the romantic walk. 
- You are welcome.
Only if my bosses knew 
what I was doing here. 
Do you really do this 
out of conviction? 
I do. 
When I was a kid 
I loved the musketeers' movies.
And they used to do this 
when trying to escape from...
the guards of the Cardinal. 
- So it doesn't mean anything. 
No, of course not. No! 
It didn't even cross my mind. .
Give me your cell.
- My cell?
If they come again... 
- Give it to me, musketeer. My battery died. 
Who are we calling?
Avdeev?
Hurray!
- Happy holiday, dear fellows! 
Russia heard you. 
Friends, why are you doing this? 
For yourselves? For PR... 
Are you kidding me? 
Don't you see what's going on around you,
in Russia, around the world? Don't you see 
that this has become a totalitarian state? 
How did you suffer from this regime? 
- Ourselves or people in general?
You fucking sexist, let me speak! 
- Speak, who's bothering you? What are you shouting for?
Yesterday the girls wanted
to hang a poster on the police door. 
They were kept for eight hours. 
- They had better go 
have sex with their boyfrineds. 
- You think all people are just sex buddies? 
Thank you.
We didn't order that.
- I did and paid for it. 
Who asked you?
- Avdeev, if you wanna be 
a real revolutionary, 
if you want to have thousands of followers
and your ugly face to be 
on each T-shirt,
you should quit acting like
you're in preschool
and go on the streets
smashing windows 
Revolution needs martyrs,
not idiots. 
Hey, why aren't you picking up? 
Hello? It's Vadim.
Are you ready for tonight? 
I'll be there at eight.
I'll see you then.
The end, bro. See you soon. 
This is my best friend Vadik.
He used to be off-beat,
he studied at Moscow State University and rode a bike.
Then he married
and joined a tobacco company.
Hi! 
- Hi.
Andryuha, hello! 
- Hi, Edick. 
Where did you disappear?
- Work. You know.
Lidochka, beautiful!
- Let it go, Maslova! 
Thank you.
Hi.
Michael...Sasha, this is Vadim. 
Vadim - Sasha. 
The tobacco magnat? 
- But not quite.
Michael.
- Vadim.
It's nice to do business 
with serious people.
No doubts about that. 
- Let's talk?
You'll disappear in New York 
and we'll take care of the club. 
I don't think I'm ready for that. 
- Why are you trying to make yourself look poor, Max?
In comparison with your companies 
the night club is like a kindergarten. 
It's not a matter of a scheme,
it's about being ready - yes or not. That's it!
What will happen with the documents? 
- Are we going to be business partners?
Partners. 
The documents are not a problem.
We'll handle the paperwork for couple of days.
- And one more thing. We'll invest 300 grand
and the management of the club will be ours.
We want not 20, but 30 percent.
Otherwise it just
won't be interesting. 
I'm giving you already grown business. 
You're just investing. 
And still it's not enough? 
- It is not.
I can't take this decision by myself. 
I need to advise.
Fine. We'll postpone it till tomorrow. 
There are more pleasant things right now. 
Real Columbian drugs. 
Have a rest.
Valya, what 30 percent? 
They will withdraw now.
Don't worry. They're afraid that
we will quit.
They will agree on 25. 
I can feel it with my ass. Go ahead!
Stay still, fucks. 
Witnesses, observe carefully.
Look, we got a dealer. 
You do understand that you won't get away with 
just with a receipt, right? 
Ok. How much do you want? 
Write down. 
- The detained...
offered a bribe on the amount of... 
How much did they offer? 
- Write down 10 000 dollars. 
Ten thousand.
Good evening. 
Let's have a talk for a minute. 
Did you forget something, penguins? 
What did you do...
Thank you, Misha, you saved us. 
-It's nothing.
We tought with Sanya 
about the 30 percent. 
It's too much. 
We can offer you 25. 
This is the limit. I'm sorry. 
I'm in. 
- I'm in too. 
Great.
Isuggest we go visit 
our club then. 
What? Are we going, partner? 
- Let's go.
The venue is situated downtown. 
Here it's a secured area,
a parking. The popularity is certain. 
Here will be placed the metal detectors
and the face control. 
We're on the list.
Voodoo plus two. 
Here, as far I understand, 
will be the wardrobe.
Yes, and there will be rest rooms and the bar. 
Altogether - three areas - 
VIP, business and economic. 
It's like an airplane. 
- Awesome!
The DJ console. 
And what about the sounding? 
You're insulting me. It's first class. 
A million dollar sound. 
A million dollars for sounding?
- Exactly.
My pride. Ìîÿòà ãîðäîñò.
The latest advance in the architecture. 
Mobile walls. 
Everything is on the move.
The room will constantly changing 
in any shapes. 
And a huge dancing. 
Here's the VIP lounge. 
Max! For now we cannot have 
the interior design though 
because of the construction works. 
But everything will be ready.
Please. In the middle and higher there will be 
two "go go" platforms.
I will deal with the performers' booking. 
We are planning 48 rides of DJs from Western Europe. 
Wait. This means every weekend? 
- Exactly. 
It's expensive.
Max, what do you think? 
Are going to have our money back soon? 
- You're impatient?
You want money? 
- Yes.
Money and fame. 
We need to pile up with greed. 
And more.
I'm not greedy.
I'm a family man.
Don't worry, we will have hundreds of this. 
Hundred clubs like this one.
I fuck my job! 
No, I'm still dealing with 
French pensioners. 
Look, the butterfly flew away.
- Flew away.
It will come again. 
There are so many interesting
things for you there.
And stop the quarrel with Garrido. 
He's been working on Norman against you for the whole night. 
And on top of that you disapperaed somewhere. 
- I had an important meeting.
Garrido in onto somthing. 
He's already reporting to Norman 
every other day. 
I know that this rat is writing accusations. 
I don't want his French ass 
in my throne. 
What can he do? 
The contract with the developers is signed. 
The transaction has been made. 
The whole of Moscow is talking 
about the "Millionaires' Paradise". 
- Good for you!
The most important thing now, son, 
is yoy don't screw up. 
And with the women... 
Be careful with the women! 
Aleksei Alekseevich, 
I need a few days off
to visit Peter, 
to check on him. 
You should have said so, 
that you want to change the scenery, 
to relax. 
I don't mind.
Listen, should I come with you? 
Aleksei Alekseevich, 
you are more needed here. 
It's true. 
Sit. 
- What? You crashed? 
Actually I have a train to catch in three hours.
- Give me an hour.
Then I will gove you a ride to the train station. 
Traffic free.
We put our glasses on.
And what do we see?
Get changed. 
- What am I gonna do with that? 
You'll get it righ duting the play. 
And we welcome our friends 
Dima and Lyova.
Hello, kids. 
I present you Dima.
Dima, you lost something. 
- No I didn't. It's not mine.
You lost it. You need to pick it up. 
- You lost it.
Save me! 
Help! 
Butt! Ass.. 
That's enough! Stop it! Stop!
Hi.
Hi. 
Wanna cigarette? 
- No, thanks. I've got mine.
Aren't you a bit too young to smoke? 
- I'm thinking of quitting. 
And you are funny. 
- Thanks for the compliment.
The good clown must earn a lot. 
- Actually yes.
Lyosha.
- Ìax.
Why are you like that... bold? 
- Because of the chemo.
Meaning?
Why did you drag me over there? 
- I don't know.
I wanted you to understand that
our actions are not just like that.
I wanted to move you.
- And did you? Idiot!
Of course. In your perfect world 
there are no sick people, 
cripples, freaks... Right, Max? 
Doesn't this remind of Nazism?
What do you want from me?
To take out bedpans? 
I've achieved everything by myself!
It's not my fault that I'm not a freak.
I think you are a freak. 
A cripple, Max.
This boy... Lyosha,
how much does he have? 
Maybe a month, maybe more, 
he's one of the long living.
I'll be back in two days
and I will call you. 
OK then. 
Have a nice journey. 
Why are we sitting, who are we waiting for? 
Max, let's go have a bite. 
You don't love deerly, Max. 
But why?
Because in 1995 
you were selling beer in a booth. 
You were drinking vodka with your father 
next to the skewers, 
while I was studying like hell 
from the English books of economics. 
You spent your first paycheck 
on a four year-old BMW 
and I went to see 
Rome and Florence. 
Because I cannot afford 
being seen with a book "The mad against the blind" 
and having a crush on "Comedy club". 
- Then what are you looking for here, 
as you say "in this country"?
- I live here.
And I want everything in this country 
to be somehow... normal. 
Fashion to be normal,
not Slava Zaicev's. 
To be normal the life, Äà å íîðìàëåí æèâîòúò,
"Spartak" and "Zenit" 
be like Inter"and "Milano", 
even if most of the people 
don't need it.
And I'm not inviting you in my world. 
Stay in yours. 
Just don't drag me into yours by force.
That's bullshit, Max.
The thing is not about Florence or Rome, 
neither in "Spartak" or "Zenit". 
People everywhere need one same thing 
and you're not different 
than me. Not even the slitest. 
But I pick my apples carefully 
and I provide for my kids. 
You're laughing 
but I already built a house
and planted a tree.
And you're doing drugs and you think 
that your dick is bigger than everyone's. 
I knew that you'll run to me 
when you open the files. 
One and the same company
always gets everything.
Gulyakin is covering for someone in Moscow,
he gets 1200. 
Most importantly - I want you 
to destroy your Gulyakin
and make a Director of the affiliate. 
The second you came 
I knew why you're here. 
This is not enough, Gulyakin. 
What do you want, huh?
- I want to know who you're sharing Moscow with. 
It's not a coinsidence that 
your advertising budget increased with 50 percent. 
Tell who he is 
and I won't touch your cuckoo pint.
I'll handle it quietly in Moscow. 
If not, you're fired tomorrow.
Actually...
- Go ahead.
Come on, come on...
Garrido.
- That bastard!
Hello, I'm at Peter's. 
Remind me the address.
I forgot it again.
You should have moved to Moscow long time ago. 
Why are you stuck here?
I don't like your Ryazan.
- I'm sorry, what?
The city of Ryazan.
Ryazan will be Ryazan.
90% of the population
arrived from the kolkhoz. 
And you? 
Decay since the blockades. 
When you turn on "Nevskii prospekt" 
you go 300 years back in time. 
We have spirituality here. 
Look at the Vasilevski island, 
the Petropavlovska fort. 
On every corner there is 
a memorial sign. 
Once there lived a poet, a writer. 
The spirituality in you
is like the alcoholic's vomit. 
I am going to "vomit" in the "vomit" store. 
At your place the intellectuals 
instead of "vomit" use "spirituality".
Let's talk about the social aspect. 
What do you think?
Nothing good.
Sit, sit... Don't get up. 
Stay put.
You're flying like...
You're saving the poor citizens from trouble?
Ok, I fly. I save them.
I would like very much to help you 
in your complex work. 
What can I do for you?
- Quit smoking right away!
You better go to Ermitrazh or to Kuntskamera. 
The city is beautiful.
We renovated it for its 300-year anniversary. 
And you're sitting here. 
Laying like a log. 
Do you even know what you are doing, 
while smoking wheed?
- No.
You're assisting the international terrorism.  
- But I didn't know.
You know what? 
Go sleep and... 
take your friend, 
he'll freeze out here.
Do want some coffee?
- No.
Lat night I saw Superman.
- Doesn't surprise me.
And my days off are to their end.
Shall we do to the train station,
I will be late for work
Ok, let's go.
Hi, Moscow is the city of 
contrasts, students and so on. 
How did you find me?
- It wasn't easy.
Why?
- I want to invite you to my birtday. 
Funny! How old are you?
- At my age
Lermontov was already shot. 
- It suits you.
The age?
- The glasses. How is it at Petersburg?
98% humidity, strong winds...
I saw Superman there.
Shall we have a walk?
There is no birthday, Max, right? 
I could't think of anything better 
but it used to work.
And now it didn't.
It's more like a date.
And why not?
- It's not your style.
What are you listening to?
À, Cure - "Next to me".
I like more
"Boys don't cry".
Why are you always 
trying to buy me, Max? 
Julia, if you want, you can come at my place 
and find out everything about me. 
What I eat, what I drink,
what music i listen to, what I read. 
If you want you can go through 
my pictures,
and hack my personal e-mail. 
You will find out a lot of nasty things. 
And then you'll have the choice 
to leave or stay.
I have to go. 
Hello, partners. 
Hi.
Where did you get the tan? 
- Forte dei Marmi. Absolut shit. 
On the account of the company? 
- Of course.
Coffee... Well, what's the news 
in the industry? 
All of our bonuses are cut off.
I'm in shock!
Big brother punished pappa junior 
because of the results from the last trimester.
And what will happen with him?
- Nothing... what.
And what about your plans, 
Maxim Evgenievich? 
Me and pappa are fine. 
I make him happy before he leave. 
I just arrived from Petersburg. 
I exposed one frog with a bribe.
I heard that 
Condratov wants a new team. 
They provided him with a 50 million dollars budget. 
- And he hired himself for 40. 
It appears that the construction is failing 
and he's firing the old team.
Were you called? 
- Yes.
No, no...
We are working hard right now. 
I see him everyday.
- Did you read "Comersant"
about how the second series finds the solution? 
- Can you send it to me?
Have you seen the new six series? 
It's time to change mine.
I accidently came 
in your office, Max, 
and took the white powder from your desk. 
This is the conclusion of the exam report. 
A narcotic - cocaine.
But that's not all, Max,
i check the project 
"Millionaires' paradise".
I talked to the local residents, 
asked the administration department,
the local archive for the documents. 
A very strange place, Max, 
In the 30s, under Stalin, 
on the territory of the military division, 
located on this exact land,
there was a secret ground polygon 
for chemical munitions. 
And there are buried ones in the forrest too. 
Nothing should be built there, Max. 
The developer didn't intend 
to build anything. 
He didn't order any residential projects 
from the project company. 
You, Max, took money 
on credit.
Did you say something, Max? 
Yesterday I took...
You are fired, Max.
Did you take a worthy bribe?
- What's wrong with you, son?
One stone, two birds, huh?
Is that what you thought you'll do?
That you would take both the money
and the bonuses from the French just before retiring? 
Then why didn't you check it?
Why did you sign the papers so quickly? 
You thought you were the smartest 
of all of us, right puppy? 
You wanted my seat? Ìèñëåøå äà ñåäíåø íà ìîåòî ìÿñòî?
I'm not thinking of retirement at all. 
I am sick of watching 
your high-and-mighty phiz!
Fucking fag! Son of a bitch! Motherfucker!
Bastard! Fucker!
What you're staring?
Maxim Evgenievich, 
would you like to call a doctor for you? 
Don't cry, Tarushka, 
you weren't lucky with your boss. 
He didn't even fuck you 
on the desk once! 
So...
You'd better send this... No. 
Play disc first on the stereo 
and then send it 
at the headquarters, in Paris,
directly to Monsieur Norman. 
You'll be back, I know it.
I'll be waiting.
What you're looking at?
One thing I can't understand.
Why people who are not stupid 
and who have good education 
are constantly trying to 
look dumber than they are?
They are really trying to be fucking idiots. 
I loathe ourselves Íåíàâèæäàì íàñ ñè,
not because we're white-collars
but because we dream 
being white-collars.
What are you looking at? 
be happy for the cellmate. 
They gave him parole. 
It's not enough, Guliyakin.
I want to know who are you
sharing Moscow with.
It's not a coinsidence that your 
budget for advertising increased with 50 percent.
Tell me who he is and 
I won't touch your cuckoo pint.
I'll handle it quietly in Moscow. 
Garrido.
You think this is normal, Max? 
By the way it is your fault.
Yeah, sure, 
- Don't "yeah, sure" me.
Look at her! I am here... Âèæ ÿ òè! Àç ñúì òóê...
Actually what are you doing here, huh?
What do you want?
- I don't want anything from you.
You want money?
- That's it, Maximka! Enough!
Stop it! Go to sleep.
Let me marry you! 
Take off your clothes.
So this is it, huh?
It is. Come on! 
Stop it, Max! That's enough! 
- I am allowed to do anything. 
I am a shit.
- You are an idiot, Max! 
Cow!
Ok... Come on, strip for me. 
Quickly, take off your clothes!
Quickly...
Partner, are you aware of 
the latest corporate news? 
What news? I can't make a difference 
between my head and my ass.
The vice-president and the manager 
of Megapolis bank department 
have been fired and note that, 
in the same day. Cool, isn't it?
Is it true what they say in Petersburg?
Meaning?
- Everybody's talking and I thought 
you were gonna tell me by yourself. 
- Vadim, stop weaseling, speak. 
They say you were fired for extortion 
of the Petersburg's affiliate for a bribe. 
- Fuckers!
Yeah, I know.
It's bullshit.
By the way you are blacklisted.
You can't be hired even for a courier now.
Thank God we have the club.
And what happened to Garrido? 
- Who would ever need him there-
in France, fuck him...
- At least here it's fine.
Ok then. See you soon.
Don't get upset. I'll call you.
Somehow nothing is simple anymore. Íÿêàê ñè íèùî íå å ïðîñòî.
Shit, it is so complicated! 
Hello?
Julia, hi. It's me. 
Hello!
- Julia, it's me. I just wanted... 
I'm joking! You're spreaking to the machine.
Leave yur message 
and I'll call you.
I sallute you, sir.
- Hi.
What's up? The usual?
Ok, wait here.
Hi, Max! 
Hi.
- How are you?
Lovely. Better than I would like to.
I read about you in "Comersant". 
Handsome boy!
Dreams come true.
- So what are going to do now? 
I'll write my memoirs 
and go on a worldwide tour. 
Come on! Don't get crazy! 
My house burned down two years ago 
with all my stuff, all appliances, 
the greenhouse, my dog and my mother in law. 
By the way how would you like to invest 
in small but profitable business? 
I'm afraid I'm not interested. 
- Don't give up just yet. 
The theme is amazing! These days
I founded a new club with Misha Voodo.
A mega project! You will get back 
your investment in six months.
Excuse me.
Misha, hi. 
- Hello.
I need to talk to you. 
- Tomorrow, man, 
I'm exhausted now. 
- Where are you? I'll come to you.
Tomorrow, man. Tomorrow. 
Haven't you seen Misha Voodo? 
- Who?
I said Voodo.
Have you seen Misha Voodo?
- Ask the DJ. 
Thanks.
Have you seen Misha? 
- What?
Have you seen Voodo?
- No, I haven't.
Come here!
Tell me, where is he? 
Fuck, speak!
Bitch! Answer me! 
Well? Where did they go?
- At the hotel.
It's not really festive. 
Dear, where's the club?
The club... Where is it?
Where's the dancing?
Where are the mobile walls? 
Where's the concrete 
I was standong on? 
Has anyone even been here in the morning? 
Like a construction worker?
Yesterday, a work man. 
He took a lot of stuff. 
Loaded the stuff in the car.
- He took it or he brought it?
I'm telling you in Russian "he took it". 
Here! He arrived, fuck it.
Who are you?
- The owners.
Where's Michael?
- We need Voodo. 
Misha Voodo.
Get out of here! 
Max... Man!
So you're alive.
Packing the bags?
- The flight is in four hours. 
And you decided to gather the partners tomorrow. 
How many are they? 
- Who knows? I didn't count them, 
Man, what a show!
I am even sorry that I'm leaving. 
Why did you do it, Misha?
- Easy money. 
Easy to come, 
easy to go. 
And there you have to work like fuck. 
- I'll be with you in a minute, sorry. 
the subscriber's telephone is not switched on or it's outside network coverage. 
Hello.
I am the owner of the club. 
It appears that all of us are the owners here.
It's a pleasure.
Is this the whole security? 
Does anyone know where Misha Voodo is? 
Take some more,
It's ok for an ald fellow. 
Chew on it! 
I can;t understand 
is it something in the water in America? 
You become such fucks there. 
- I haven't thought about it.
Maybe they are messing up with the water.
I'll find out.
And why are you keeping this dick 
in your mouth all time? 
This?
Image, Max. Image!
Max signed in too. 
Morone.
Hello, mate! Hello.
We were screwed.
These people are my partners. Your partners too. 
We were fooled.
We are fucking retards!
There's no club. 
Never will be.
And your friends took off... 
- Vasya, they are as my friends as yours. 
- Why are you so cool, huh? 
you don't care about your money? 
- Vasya, handle yourself and stop yelling. 
You brought me into this.
That's why I lost all my money! 
Are you in the scheme with them, huh? 
Did they save for you some of the money?
Vadya!
- You're mocking me like I'm a rat, aren't you? 
Vadya, it's just money! Paper! 
- Where is my money?
Scraps of paper!
- Where is it?
You're blaiming me for nothing, Vadim. 
All night I was trying to save your money. 
You won't receive it until tomorrow. 
Fuck you! Have a little hard time, son of a bitch.  
You may find out that
your only friend is the money.  
The money, fucker. The money!
Bastard!
Piece of shit!
pathologically greedy fuck!
Hello?
- Please be so kind, I'm looking for Julia. 
She doesn't want to speak to you.
- Avdey, put Julia on the phone. 
Amigo, "doesn't want" means "deasn't want".
What other meaning could there be?
That's it. Get lost.
Vadya.
Vadechka, pick up the phone. 
Vadya!
Vadya, pick up the phone! 
Please leave a message. The subscriber you are trying to reach 
is not available at the moment.
They didn't call them,
I won't call them either. 
I'm leaving.
- Ok.
What kind of business is this
and where would go such amount of money? 
Calm down.
Fuck!
That's it! We're here! 
I don't know who the fuck are those people 
and what they're doing here 
or what I'm doing here. 
You see,
I became one with this sewer. 
Yeah.
- I blew it all.
I lost my only friend.
Love, career, I lost everything.
I just said that.
- I said it. 
Now you need a change. 
Just... something unfamiliar, something new. 
You understand?
Do you want a complete freedom? 
You need to make one step. 
A tiny little step and that's it. 
Hop, hop...
- Take your hand off. 
Do you think we have a chance, you and me? 
In vain.
Youo know, for most of them this is 
something normal. A regural thing.
That's it! Punch the fagot. 
Do it!
Come on, hit him, 
for every moment yet to live! 
It's not enough... I want more! 
Guys, let me show you something. 
Alyonochka! My queen! 
Help me.
Let me tell you what happened. 
You know him?
- I have no idea who he is.
Come on, let's go.
Please, sir. For God's sake! 
Now it's time for rest. 
It's not time for visits. Do you hear me?
You see, all children 
are sleeping already. God! 
Where's the little boy?
There was a boy, Lyosha. Where is he? 
Alyosha? So you need Alyosha? 
He is in resuscitation. 
He's in a come and he won't wake up
till the end. 
Ok.
I see.
Excuse me.
A group of people who are calling themselves 
"free radicals",
organized an action 
at the center of the city.
They are screaming anti-states slogans 
there are constantly 
young people coming here 
joining the group.
STOP GORGING!
Stop immediately these illegal actions and scatter.
Where are you going? 
What do you need? 
- Open. I said open! 
We will be forced to apply 
force to our actions.
What are you doing?
Go away! 
Back off!
You don't have anyone to bang? 
I need to talk to you. Let's go 
before you set everything on fire
and those are still calm.
- Max!
What do you want?
Me wasting my time with you? 
And then I should be proud of it? 
I would die from such boredom. 
And I would die, if it wasn't for you. 
Stop lying, Max! Go away! 
- Ok, I'm leaving.
Just... give me some time. 
Is that ok? 
Let's leave here together
and then... Then we'll find them. 
Do we have a deal?
- You belong to a dunghill. 
You'll never change, Max. 
I said get lost!
Your time is off.
Counting to ten: one...
Two... 
- Òhree!
Hello, 430. I'm listening. 
- Help me!
Help!
- Please, tell me where you are located? 
It's pressing me from everywhere! 
Do something!
- Calm down. Everything will be fine. 
Breathe deep.
Hello?
- Max, hello.
Julia?
- Yes.
Hi.
- Listen... How are you?
I'm wonderful.
- Yeah? That's great.
Where are you?
- Well, I'm in the police station. 
Can you pick me uo?
- I'll be there.
Really?
