Okay, Kuwaiti Star,  
this is US Navy helo.
 Kuwaiti Star, we're moving

Who cares?
He's getting married

Hey, there you are.
Hey.
How are you doing?
I don't know, man.
Stopped drinking

Shouldn't have done that.       
                         Mmm-hm.
I don't know if I can
do this thing, Jim.

You should consider           
                   the source.
Is this really what 
you wanna do, Billy?
Yeah. Hell, I guess so.
You guess so.          
Well, that's beautiful.
Well, I'm sorry, guys,     
but I cannot be a part     
of this funeral procession.
See you later!

Thank you!

I can't figure which.

I came through a skylight.
And you had contact
in the hallway?    
One confirmed.
What was your action            
                    at the obje?
I entered the room

Swept left to right.  
Did you fire your weapon?
Fucking A, sir.
There were no

Crew chief was dead.

I covered their movement

You engaged hostiles?
I vaporized hostiles.
Why did you decide to break

She's not gonna  
give us anything.
What they've got is the  
perfect terrorist weapon.
Portable, hand-held.     
Jesus. What a mess.
Those fanatics      
got a warehouse full
of these missiles.  
Why in the hell didn't you
blow those things when you
had the chance?           
Sir, the lieutenant made
a decision under fire.  
And we stand behind
that decision.     
Navy SEALs,   
they're paid  
to take risks.
They're paid to get shot at,
they're paid to die         
if necessary.               
Now, I take exception

Damn it, Warren.
The point here is not what
might have been done,     
but what we do now.       
With due respect, sir,
let me take my team   
back in there.        
With my first-hand knowledge
of this Shaheed...          
(CLEARS THROAT)
That'll be up to
the President.  
Now, we'll see if he wants
to give your SEALs another
opportunity.              
Nobody's blaming the SEALs
and nobody is blaming you,
Curran.                   
Sir, I don't care               
                 about the blam.
I care about the                
                safety of my te,
and I care about
getting those   
Stingers back.  
The situation
has changed. 
No one knows where
in the hell those 
missiles are.     
It's up to the
intelligence  
community now.
It's out of our hands.
Completely out        
of our hands.         
I don't accept that.
It's out of your hands.
You're an operator,
not a policymaker. 
Get used to it.    
I had him.
I should have taken him out
when I had him.            
How do you know        
you would have made it?
I think more than likely
you and your team       
would have been waxed.

You're involved.         
I won't be an accomplice.
Well, who are you helping       
                         by note
                               ?
All right.
Write your story.
And the next one.
And when the next plane         
                       is shot ,
make sure you get               
                 the names and s
                               .
Okay.
But I can't volunteer
anything.            
You ask the questions

All right.

Walid Fahladi.
Wasn't he with Shaheed's

Balbec. Right.     
Balbec.            
Yeah, that's right.
Right, right, right.        
Now we're getting someplace.
Except he dropped

What did I just say?
Why don't we just go in there,

                              a?
Sounds great.
I don't think

What do you expect?
I don't think you

                that this adminn

of a foreign national.
MAN: Warren, hear him out.   
                          No.
I appreciate your zeal
in this matter, Dick, 
but it's totally    
out of the question.
Just a minute.                 
              We know this guy.
You know him, Elliott?
Yeah, he's a paid asset.
We've bought information
from him in the past.   
I always thought     
he was a little fish.
If this guy has any      
information, why hasn't  
he contacted you already?
He's probably                
             scared shitless.
But if we extract him           
                     and we makk
                               ,
I feel certain he'd sell us     
                           anyt.
Look, can we call this          
                      a defecti.
You can call it                 
               an immigration   
                             if.

All right.

Remember, there's

I'd be happy

So would he, I'm sure.
I want you to keep

So you have to stay   
in commercial airspace
and jump from 12 miles
offshore and swim in. 
Assuming everything
goes okay,         
the biggest thing to worry
about is the extraction.  
You'll be extracting           
                    in a Ribex.
It'll be on radar

No, it isn't.
Just because we aren't

It's a one-way street!
Oh, shit!
REXER: We know the ocean        
                        is weste
                               ,
so where the fuck are we?
Lost.
It looks the same.    
It all looks the same.
REXER: Stay left.
The sub leaves                
              in five minutes.
This doesn't
look good.  
It just got worse.
Duck!             
(SHOUTING)
I think we lost them.
Behind us!
Oh, shit! He's right
on my ass!          
We got to get
out of here! 
No, don't move!           
He can't get a clear shot!
Hard right! Hard right!         
                       Hard rig!
Leary, you got that missile.
You might wanna think       
about using it.             
I would if I could figure
the damn thing out.      
It's a one-shot deal.
What?
You miss, we die.
(EXCLAIMS)
We lost them!        
I think we lost them!
Thank God!
I can smell the ocean.  
We're close. Real close.
Yeah, real close.
Fuck!    
Get down!
Waste that fucker!
Eat this!
Outstanding.
Come on! Come on!
Rexer!
Rexer.
The car's on fire, guys.
Come on, we got time.     
We got to get out of here!
What about Rexer?
Rexer's dead.    
We got to...         
Leave him! He's dead.
Come on, Hawk! Get him up!
Get him up!               
Come right 270 degrees.

All ahead standard.
Ten more minutes.               
                 That's all I a.

                             thr
                               .
No way I'm gonna 
hazard this boat.
All ahead standard.

(SCREAMS)
(GUN FIRES)
(GASPING)
Clear!
Any sign of the sub?
What do you think?
It's typical.
(COUGHING)
Maybe they heard something.
Maybe.
Maybe they heard
the explosion.  
HAWKINS: How long you guys
wanna wait?               
(ALL LAUGHING)
(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
Feel it in the air
 Pressure's on the rise
all the way            
 Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
There's no escape
 No turning back      
when you walk the edge
You've got to find a way
 Don't turn your heart
to stone this time    
There's no time to waste
Shadows on the border line
Racing with the wind
 You try and somehow
turn the tide       
Do what you can this time
Do what you can this time
Rebels on the run
 Facing down the guns
of anger now         
Your back's to the wall
 Got to give it up
Don't run away    
 No turning back       
when you cross the line
It's no man's land again
 Courage to stand      
and fight for the truth
Until the very end
Shadows on the border line
Racing with the wind
Try to somehow turn the tide
Do what you can this time
Do what you can this time
Shadows on the border line
Racing with the wind
Try to somehow turn the tide
 And change it     
Change it all again
Shadows on the border line
Racing with the wind
Try to somehow turn the tide
Do what you can this time
Do what you can
Do what you can this time
Do what you can
Do what you can this time
Do what you can
Do what you can
