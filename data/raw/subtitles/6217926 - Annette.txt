- She looked at me and smiled.
That smile.
She is... was...
A very shy person, you see,
and I know,
I knew this shy smile
meant she wanted to fuck.
But this time,
I pretended not to get it.
And I kept on pretending
and so she said it,
ever so shyly:
"Please, Henry.
Fuck me, Henry."
And I could see the effort
in her smile,
for her to ask that,
to say those dirty words,
to be wicked and bold,
so out of character.
With that very shy smile
I loved so much.
But I couldn't answer,
I couldn't meet her desire.
'Cause, yes,
being in love makes me sick.
Sick!
I had been sleepless
all night, you see,
suffocating, suffocated by love.
A wreck.

Death?
Yes, no desire left.
Zero.
So I was looking for something,
anything to change the subject,
to spare us both this horrible,
dreadful moment of rejection.
That's when the idea came to me.
I remembered how extremely
ticklish she is... was...
Especially on the soles
of her feet.
So I thought: I'll tickle her,
to change the subject.
So I grabbed her legs,
locked both of her feet
under my arms
and started to tickle them.
I could see in her eyes
she understood it all.
(grunting)
Why I was doing what I was doing
to change the subject.
(grunting)
And it seemed impossible
she would laugh this time.
She was hurt.
(grunting)
And ashamed. (grunting)
And sad and confused.

But I persisted,
I tickled gently...

There was a girl
From the middle of nowhere
Utterly plain
A little plump
She sang alone
In her bedroom
Wild acclaim
From those four walls
But she didn't want to be there
She didn't want to be there
She didn't want to be there
At all
She had the voice
Of a goddess
Strings, winds and horns
Inside her chest
Hour after hour
She would struggle
Till her voice became
Her royal realm
She wanted just to be there
Only wanted to live there
Really wanted to live there
Forever more
She headed west
The wild direction
No longer plain
No longer plump
The men were on her doorstep
Many men were on her doorstep
Her voice had brought her beauty
And set her free
But she never listened
to those men

A queen should never
