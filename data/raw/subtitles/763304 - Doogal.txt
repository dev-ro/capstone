So long, Zebedee.
Aah!
Zeebad!
Only a bad dream.
Everything seems fine.
# Ho ho ho. it's magic #
Can you imagine a faraway land
where everybody is the best of friends?
Well, here it is.
# It's magic #
# You know #
And in this land
not entirely like our own,
lived a puppy, Doogal,
and the girl on the swing
is his best friend Florence.
Who else is there?
Ermintrude the cow.
There's Brian, the snail.
Brian loved Ermintrude.
Florence and Doogal.
And Florence and Doogal.
Doogal and Florence.
And that's Zebedee,
the good wizard.
Oh, Doogal!
And here they all are together,
and together is what
this story is all about.
# ... never seen a daybreak #
# Leaning on my pillow
in the morning light #
Doogal?
Doogal, I just knew you'd make it.
- Oops.
- They're about to start rehearsal.
Oh, yeah. Sure, Florence.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Well, you'd better not think
you're getting some candy
just for showing up.
Candy? Who needs candy?
Not me. I quit...
this morning.
Hmm. I'll believe that
when I see it.
Ermintrude is about to begin.
Be nice.
- Not again.
- I said nice!
Unh!
Two, three, four!
Crank it, Mr. Rusty!
# Girl, you really got me goin' #
# You got me so I don't know
what I'm doin' #
Shake that T-bone!
# Girl, you really got me now #
# You got me so I can't sleep at night #
Hit it, Dairy Queen.
# Oh, yeah #
# You really got me now #
Doogal?
# You got me so I don't know
what I'm doin' now #
# Oh, yeah #
# You really got me now #
# You are a singin',
dancin' bovine #
# You really got me #
# You really got me #
# You really got me #
Whoa! Hey! Whoa!
Oh, man, would you look at that?
What an unforeseeable accident!
That's a pretty bad flat.
We're looking at
a multiple abrasion friction gash.
Huh! I didn't know you were
a qualified mechanic, Doogal.
Of course! If you bring me
an air pump, some glue,
four water skis, a trombone,
and a package of Jawbreakers,
I might just be able
to help you out.
I am lucky you are here.
Oh! Can you take care of my things?
No problem!
I'll take care of them all right.
Hmm.
I think I'll take care
of those lollipops,
and then those candy canes,
and then those jellybeans!
Oh, Doogal's in heaven!
Whoa!
Ohh! Ohhhh!
Encore! Encore!
Thank you to the snail
in the first row.
Whoa!
Aah!
It's okay, Ermintrude!
You're doing great!
Aah!
Watch out, Florence!
Whoa!
Sorry.
Well, looks like Doogal strikes again.
Uh-oh. Oh, gee, that's not good.
Aah!
- Oh!
- No!
Everyone hang on!
Now, there's something
you need to know about this carousel.
It was magical.
I can't get off!
And it had something dark
and dangerous locked inside.
Free at last!
That was Zeebad,
the evil wizard Zebedee defeated
and locked away years ago
before he could freeze the world.
Oh, no! Florence!
What a trip, man.
Buzzkill.
When Florence gets out of there,
you are gonna be
grounded for life.
Oh, no!
Doogal, what's happening?
Florence, are you all right?
Doogal, it's cold.
Don't worry, Florence.
We'll get you out of there.
What are we gonna do?
Zebedee! Zebedee!
Zebedee!
Whatever's the matter,
my friends?
- Zebedee...
...something terrible has happened.
Look.
Oh, no!
I hoped this day
would never come.
What? Tuesday?
But Tuesdays are great.
No, Doogal,
the day Zeebad escapes.
Zeebad? But he's just
a shaggy dog story.
I'm afraid not, Doogal.
He's all too real...
coldhearted, tyrannous, and cruel,
and now you've released him.
Ha ha ha!
Unh!
Oh, right on!
The Blue Man Group's back in town.
Two words, sir...personal hygiene.
Mmm. Don't mind if I do.
What the...?
Soon it will be
nice and frozen everywhere,
just like it was before
Zebedee ruined everything.
Now, if I recall,
I checked some baggage on that flight.
Booya!
- Hello!
- Nice! You'll do fine.
Loyal. Brainless.
And I've got to admit,
I like the mustache.
And you'll obey my every command!
- Yeah, all right.
- This ain't the ballet, nutcracker.
Don't have the shoes for it, sir.
- Now, march!
- Capital idea!
Heh heh heh!
# I don't know, but I've been told #
# We're gonna make
the world real cold #
Ten-hut!
I call this one the Spin Cycle.
Look at that, I'm great...
I'm average... I'm terrible.
This is not gonna work.
I'm sorry, has anyone seen my...?
Uhh.
Interns.
- Ten-hut!
- I'm back!
Before you put an eye out.
Sam the Sidekick,
ready to blindly follow orders... sir!
Solid.
Now, here's the dealio, Sam.
I have to get my hands
on three totally awesome diamonds
so I can rule the world.
You're gonna help me.
Pain, misery, and torment will be
on your daily to-do list.
And your only break... will be death!
Heh heh heh!
Oh... drag.
Can I ask about holidays?
- Three weeks, in summer.
- That's off the hook, sir!
Not that it'll ever be summer again.
It's a bit of a loophole.
You don't like it, talk to H.R.
Anywho, let's see what
Zebedee-doo-dah is up to.
Oh... what do you got in there?
Well, well.
He's amassed an army...
the dog, a cow, a snail.
I'm doomed.
Animals will be harmed
in the making of this film.
Now, to my hideout...
and the diamonds.
Only by returning
the enchanted diamonds
to their original places
on the roundabout
will you defeat Zeebad.
But if he finds them first,
he will use them to freeze the sun.
You must head north
into the mountains.
There is no time to waste.
Whoa! A hot map.
Okay, you want us to go
after the diamonds. Cool.
But what we supposed to do,
take the bus or something?
Okay, that's a box
with a button on it.
Did you see that?
He just pressed a magic button
and made a train!
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!
You got it.
I'm the train, and you're not.
Take good care of this
little box of tricks.
It may save you in your hour of need.
Florence, we'll find those diamonds
and get you out of there.
I promise.
I believe in you, Doogal.
Remember, it's not your fault.
Don't blame yourself.
- No. Leave that to us.
- Huh?
All aboard!
Don't worry, you guys.
I know Doogal's gonna save us.
Uh-oh.
We're in so much trouble.
Woops. Sorry.
And so,
while Zebedee searched for Zeebad,
Doogal and his friends set out
to find the enchanted diamonds.
Doogal knew
that if he didn't find them,
he might never see Florence again.
I'm so sorry, Florence.
Doogal?
Yeah?
You shouldn't feel guilty
just because this is all your fault.
Me?!
Oop. Sorry.
That didn't come out right.
My fault?
What did I do?
Other than busting up
the merry-go-round
and trapping Florence
and those children,
causing the escape of a maniac
so he could run around
and freeze the sun?
Other than that, nothing.
All I wanted was to get
my paws on some candy.
Yeah. It starts with candy bars, man...
maybe a Snickers fun-size...
and before you know it, you've eaten
all the Three Musketeers and their families.
Oh, yeah.
Maybe you've got, like,
a problem, my furry friend.
No, I don't.
And I'm not gonna rest until
I've done everything in my power
to make things right.
Ooh! It's gettin' cold!
As our heroes
made camp for the night,
none of them had any idea as to
the danger that lurked in the shadows.
Doogal!
Do you get tired of watching us work?
You gonna help us
put up the tents?
Hmm?
Uh, no. You guys are
doing a wonderful job.
I mean, keep up the good work.
I'd just be in the way.
Oh... and who's making
dinner tonight?
'Cause I'm getting kinda hungry.
Oh, I see.
The silent treatment, huh?
Well, fine!
I got my own camp over here,
and it's awesome.
I don't need you guys.
Ahh. The full moon.
What do you say, Ermintrude?
Feel like jumping over it
with me?
Ermintrude?
I can't believe I'm missing
my big show tonight!
Ooh, these hills have
some phenomenal acoustics.
Let me hear you say...
# Hey! Oh! Ho! #
# Ho! #
# Say ho #
- Look out!
- Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
I slimed my shell.
Are you happy now?
Your singing killed my chocolate.
All right, y'all.
Beauty sleep time.
Not that I need it. Dylan!
- Dylan!
- What's up, Doc?
It's bedtime.
Thank you.
I might've slept right through it.
Someone should guard the camp,
and I was thinking...
Good. You're on.
What?
Night, y'all.
But, uh...
Alone?
Come on, Train.
Oops! I tooted.
No, no, no, no, no!
Master Chief ate it!
Look at me. I'm all alone,
guarding against the cold.
Watchdog! What's wrong
with a watch snail?
Or a watch cow?
Uhh...
Who goes there?
- Don't make me bite you.
- Yeah, that's scary.
Back up. I-I know dog-fu.
Yeah. Listen, man, there's this
hostile little blue guy with an...
Who's that?
There he is.
Zebedee, is that you?
- Uh...
- Yes!
Aah!
Good boy.
Doogal!
Here, Doogal, Doogal, Doogal!
This is not cool, dude!
We're worried about you, man!
Whoa!
Hey, look! Tracks!
I think they were left by feet.
Wait. I've seen these before.
They can only be made
by the abominable...
...moose?
Don't worry.
I speak Moose, everyone.
Hey, buddy...
Ma-ma say, ma-ma sah,
ma-ma say soo kah.
Yeah, dude. Su-sussudio
and In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. Come on!
You're wasting your time, Brian!
Whoever heard
of a talking moose, huh?
He says he'll grant us three wishes
if we stand...
I said I know where your dog is!
Doogal! He knows
where Doogal is!
Come on! Hurry!
Nice weapon, sir.
I just hope we never have to
fight someone at room temperature.
You're gonna be in trouble
when Zebedee gets here.
Too bad
no one knows you're here.
Now, dog, tell me everything.
Well... I was a very happy puppy.
My first memories are of
catching tennis balls with Florence.
And then, as I grew up...
Pipe down!
Tell me about the diamonds!
If you care about your friends at all,
you'll give me the secret location
of the super-powered bling-bling!
Well, you're wasting your time.
I don't even have the map.
So... there's a map, huh?
Oh! Uh... no, no, no, no, no!
No map.
You know, I wonder
how long it would take
for a little girl to freeze solid
inside a merry-go-round?
- Doogal!
- Florence!
Stay away from her!
Help me help you help the girl!
- The map!
- Forget it, Frosty!
Ooh! Tough guy.
Sam, put down the lint roller!
I'm sorry. There's just
dog hair everywhere.
I need you to
work this mutt until he talks.
Get busy!
Right! "B" to the "izzy."
Uh, look, this torture stuff's
a bit new to me,
so, uh, what is it
you're most afraid of?
Oh, uh... hmm.
Okay. World domination speech.
Hello, citizens of the world! Yes!
- Uh...
- Oh, this is awful!
No! No more!
Oh, good, Sam.
Enjoy yourself.
Oh! No more! Please!
Twenty-six! Oh...
I can't stand it!
Twenty-seven! Oh, you can't
possibly take much more of this.
You've eaten twenty-seven
caramels already!
You'll have to make me eat a hundred
before I tell you anything!
And of course I'll be
renaming the planet Iceland.
Eh, no. That's taken.
Uh... Planet Freeze!
Uh... Chilly Town!
Nah. Frost-topia.
We'll bring in some focus groups.
We'll workshop.
Please! No more!
- You have quite a tolerance for pain!
- Ohh!
- Huh?
Ohh! Ow!
Ohh!
I can't feel my paws!
Hee hee hee!
You all right?
- No, not too bad. I rather...
Oh! And my face
will be on all the money!
We'll call them Zee-bills.
Blue will be the new green. Yes.
No! Leave me alone,
you evil, evil fiend!
Doggy-dog,
are you out of your mind?
We tryin' to bust you
out of this joint!
Could you come back
in five minutes?
I think I can get
some lollipops out of him.
Okay, back it up, man.
Okay. Take her back,
take her back!
Finish him off, Sam.
Time we...
Where's the dog? How do you lose
something that was in a cage?
You're absolutely right, sir.
My bad.
Not prepared for the falling cow.
Huh?
Not so fast.
Get your hands
off the merchandise, Slick!
That's no way to treat a diva!
Ermintrude!
Help!
Aah!
Ohh!
Back it up! Back it up!
How nice of you to drop in!
Don't... ever... touch... my girlfriend...
...again!
Doh!
What's this?
The cow and the snail...
classic romance.
Follow them.
Come on, guys.
Let's keep moving.
We've got to get out of here fast!
Doogal,
you know I love your hairy hide,
but just once can you try
to stay out of trouble?
Whoa! Whoa!
# We're spinnin', spinnin' around #
# Bom bom bom bom #
# We're spinnin', spinnin' around #
# Bom bom bom bom #
# We're spinnin', spinnin' around #
# Bom bom bom bom #
# We're spinnin', spinnin' around #
# Ooh ooh ooh ooh #
# Bom bom bom,
bom-bom-bom bom bom bom #
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way! Ohh!
Stop!
Man!
That's deep!
I slimed my shell.
You took the words
right out of my mouth!
- Sam?
- Yes?
Your sword.
Sir!
En garde!
Hey, man...
give peace a chance!
Nobody can save you now!
Zebedee!
Zebedee! Zebedee!
You!
So, we meet again.
Indeed.
I've waited 10,000 years
for my revenge,
and as you know, revenge
is a dish best served cold.
Way to go, Zebedee!
You know, I think
his spring has sprung!
Ohh!
Hey! Where do you
think you're going?
Sam!
Sam, stop! Think about
what you're doing!
But I've got a job now.
I'm not just a fixture on a merry-go-round.
I'm a soldier!
You may wear a soldier's uniform, Sam,
but it's what's inside that counts.
Zebedee, look out!
Aah!
Good shot, sir!
Run! Run!
Come on, gang!
Here's our chance!
Aah! Not again!
Aah!
Just... stand... still!
Your days in the sun
are over, Zebedee!
You know, there can only be
one spring to rule them all,
and I am the Lord of the Springs.
Wait! Zebedee's in trouble!
No! Save yourselves!
What'll we do?
What'll we do?
Well, we can't leave him.
To the rescue!
You've got to find the diamonds!
Aah!
You know, Zebedee,
I've been thinking.
You been working so hard,
puttin' in the hours,
it's time to take a break.
Get the diamonds!
No!
We don't have a choice.
We have to go now.
There's nothing more
we can do here.
Come on, Doog.
- Hurry.
No, Sam, the evil laugh really comes
from the back of the throat.
None of them
wanted to believe it,
but in his heart,
Doogal knew it was true.
Zebedee had gone forever.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Zeb's dead, baby.
Zeb's dead.
But Zebedee's magic is the only thing
that can stop Zeebad.
What are we gonna do?
Be strong, Ermintrude.
We have to be brave.
The world is counting on us.
After all, that was
Zebedee's dying wish.
What are we gonna do?
Without Zebedee,
we're nothing.
Yeah.
Then we
should just give up.
No! Brian's right!
We're gonna save our world!
Dylan, where's the map?
It's right here.
There... head for
the tallest mountain, straight ahead!
That's the spirit, everyone!
It would take a sea of boiling lava
to keep us from those diamonds now!
No way.
Hey,
look on the bright side...
when the rest of the world
freezes over, we could all live here.
This can't be the end.
I've got to save Florence!
Well, then, we can't leave
without the diamond,
and it's somewhere over there.
Hey, Doogal, aren't dogs
supposed to, like, fetch?
Not me. The only tricks
I know are, "Sit, Doogal,"
and chasing my tail
till I pass out.
And I'm allergic
to being burnt up.
What about Dylan?
He's got nine lives.
Yeah. That's a cat, genius.
- Enough!
- Huh?
Ahem. We should all go together.
Or...
...one of us stays here,
in case something happens.
He's not a dog,
he's a chicken.
Hmm?
All right, all right.
I understand.
You don't want to go
without your leader.
Ooh! Is anybody else hot?
The bridge
was very, very high.
The path was very, very narrow.
The lava was very, very hot.
Do you think they were scared?
Wouldn't you be?
Ohh!
Careful!
It's okay.
This is gonna be a snap.
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
No!
Hang on! Hang on!
Up! Pull us up!
Dylan, do something!
Give it some gas!
I don't know what to do!
Watch out! What does this one do?
Up, down, up, down?!
I think I can, I think I can,
I think I can,
I think I can!
Hey! I can!
That wasn't even funny!
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Okay, no need to panic.
Now! Now panic, everybody!
Whoa!
That was awesome!
Could we go again?
Can we? Can we go again?
Guys!
Hey, guys, over here!
Hurry up!
I think I see it!
Look at it!
It's beautiful!
Ladies and gentlemen,
presenting the first diamond.
And you guys thought
we couldn't do it.
I hope I am pure of heart enough...
Woop! Just kind of
pops right out.
My precious!
Kidding!
There's a picture inside of it.
What...what if they never come back?
I'm so cold!
Come on, we can't give up hope.
Look! It's Florence!
Strange. For a second there,
I thought I heard something.
Never mind.
It couldn't have been.
She heard me?
Florence, it's me, Doogal!
You've got to hang on!
Doogal, is that you?
l- I can't hear you!
No, come back!
Florence!
Doogal!
She's my best friend.
If Florence doesn't make it,
I don't know how I will.
Ohh.
Ohh!
For me?
And I didn't get you anything.
And now, the map.
Who said anything about a map, huh?
Oh, Doogal, you didn't.
But they tortured it out of me.
Yes. We're proud of our work.
Let's have it.
I'm sorry.
Where's my head?
- Please?
- Over my dead body.
See, Sam? Try to be civil,
use the "P" word...
I guess now I'll have to get
the garlic butter!
You're bluffing.
Look, it's the map,
or you're snail parmesan.
You mess with the snail
and you talkin' to the cow!
Here. Take the stupid map.
You can't read it.
It's in Pig Latin.
Oh, really?
Ice-nay Y-tray.
I studied Pig Latin
in "Ice School," dog.
Sorry we can't stay,
but you know how it is.
Diamonds to find,
planets to freeze.
Been nice seeing you all again.
Come on, Sam.
Gonna play a little game
called Break the Bridge.
Sounds like fun, sir.
What's the objective?
Just... follow... me!
Like this, sir?
Ten-hut! Yes!
Hello!
That's good! Yes, sir!
Hi!
Ohh!
This is a bad game!
Ohh!
Good work, Sam!
I should give you a raise!
Yes, sir.
Dude, that guy's,
like, totally villainous, man.
What is up with that?
I mean, did he not get
enough structure as a kid,
or, I don't know?
How are we ever
gonna get out of here?
That's it! Show's over!
We're finished!
Just as I was about to hit it big!
You are big.
Thanks, Doogie, but I want
to go out singing like Aretha,
not grilled up like some
big old sirloin steak.
Hey, now, wait.
Might I remind you that we are
carrying a secret weapon.
You mean our faith in each other
and the power of friendship?
Sure, that, and...
Zebedee's magic box!
Cool!
Now, if I could just get my head
around how to work this thing.
Did Zebedee give anyone
the instructions?
Just press the button!
Okay! Chill!
A boat. Great.
And now we'll just sail away
on the boiling lava.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I've got a set of tools.
Anyone seen Pimp My Boat?
He's really lost it this time.
Ooh, this heat
is makin' my skin all leathery!
I must look like a walkin' handbag!
Oh, no, Ermintrude.
I think you look...
that is, I find you...
Look, in case we don't
make it out of here,
I just want you to know that...
Hey, anyone need a lift?
Whoa!
# You're simply wonderful #
Dylan had made
a balloon out of the tents...
a harebrained idea,
you might say.
A rather good one,
if you ask me.
# You catch me
every time I fall #
Bunny, bunny, bunny!
A flying boat? Not bad!
That's some smart thinking.
It's all about altitude
over attitude, Ermin-dude.
Excuse me. We still have
one small problem.
We have no idea where we're going.
Brian's right.
We could drift around here
for years.
Or, we could just, like,
follow them.
# Take one down...
watch it, it's hot! #
# 98 kettles of tea on the wall #
# 98 kettles of tea on the wall #
# 98 kettles of tea... #
# No kettles of tea on the wall #
All right, next song.
Any requests?
How about
"The Sound of Silence"?
Okay. You'll have to harmonize.
I'll take the high notes, and...
No, Sam. Zip it.
I gotta get my head on straight
about these diamonds.
The map only tells us so much.
If I fail, we're in for a world of green fields,
and flowers, and all kinds of...
And trees, and rainbows,
and fuzzy little bunny rabbits
with big heads...
Just pipe down and row, Garfunkel!
Soon, I will have ultimate power.
There'll be no sun!
And I'll get a blue Humvee
that reads "Ice Man" on the side of it.
Booya!
Sam... you're ruining the moment.
Sorry, sir.
Is that a falling star, Trude?
Falling?!
Do not talk about falling when we are
floating perilously above the earth
in a homemade balloon!
Hmm.
Okay.
Aren't the stars beautiful?
Mm-hmm.
So beautiful!
Wouldn't you love to be one of them?
I'd give anything.
You'd make a wonderful star.
Oh, Brian. Now you're just
playing with me.
So serene.
So heavenly.
Traveling everywhere in a limo!
Always looking down on everyone.
Ohhh, yes!
We should get some sleep, man.
Seriously, is that all you think about?
Well, only when I'm awake.
I can't sleep.
I'm too worried about Florence.
She's so helpless without me.
She must be petrified.
Pet... fried?
Bad karma!
It's just, we're a team.
Whatever we do,
we do it together.
Her life would be quite empty
without me there.
Yeah. Me sleepy now.
During scary thunderstorms,
she insists I sleep on the bed with her...
for her protection.
She just loves to throw
a tennis ball.
And who's always there
to bring it back,
just so that she can have
the enjoyment of throwing it again?
I'm telling you, Dylan,
I bet she really misses that.
Really.
Really.
I know I do.
Hey, guys, Skull Island.
It looks just like it does in the movies.
Ice. That means more Zeebad.
Something strange
is definitely afoot.
Oh, it's definitely afoot.
Hope Kong's not awake.
Guys, this place
looks kind of creepy.
Maybe we should circle
the island again.
Ah! We're a couple of real
Tomb Raiders, aren't we, sir?
There we go.
Welcome to the Aztec Galleria Mall.
Let's bounce.
Hold up, sir, hold up.
After me, sir.
It could be dangerous,
and I've got a sixth sense.
Yes, and you almost lost
three through five.
Why don't you use
some common sense?
I'm gonna go check
for hieroglyphics.
Ah, here we go.
Men's room, food court...
Ha! Booby-trapped lobby.
Well, that was a bad idea.
Someone could get hurt
walking through here.
Land, ho!
What was that?
They're still alive?!
Well, wax my mustache!
It's perfect!
It'll be like mice in a mousetrap.
They'll clear the way,
and then we just stroll in
and get the cheese.
Quite evil of you, sir!
Are you sure
we're sure about this?
It's not too late to turn around.
Or...
Whoa! Aah!
Ow!
Sorry.
Hey! Look at all these cool plants!
Ohh!
We should, like,
send Zeebad a bouquet.
I wonder where Zeebad is.
I think we must have passed him.
Nice one, Train.
No worries, Rabbit.
Wait here,
and keep your pistons pumping.
We're gonna need 'em
for a quick getaway.
Oh, look!
Full of caveman pictures!
It might just mean "Welcome,"
or "Aloha," or, uh...
"Death to All Who Come Here."
I know. Why don't you
go on up ahead.
We'll be right behind you, prayin'.
Oh, for Pete's sake,
I'll go.
It's amazing we've gotten this far
with all this whining and sarcasm.
If we put half as much work into
the mission as we put into our bickering...
I guess Brian really does
have a backbone.
And here's an idea.
Why don't we stop thinking
just about ourselves
and start paying attention
to what's going on around us
instead of living
in our own little bubble.
Nobody ever asks,
"Brian, what do you think about politics?
"Brian, seen any good movies lately?
Brian, are you any good
at video games?"
Because, yes, I am.
I have excellent reflexes.
But if I gotta hear one more joke
about snail-mail or being shell-shocked,
I think I'm gonna lose my cool!
Because, honestly,
the wrong words can be crushing.
Hmm.
Let's go!
I never thought I'd say this,
but what a snail!
You know when you
have butterflies in your tummy?
Well, the poor little train
had butterflies in his boiler.
Hmm!
- Hey!
- Whoa!
Anybody find the diamonds?
Whoa, whoa! Let's use
our inside voices, Doogal.
Start looking for clues.
Hmm. This must be
where they had all the luaus.
Oh, a throne! The perfect place
to enjoy my last piece of bubble gum.
Oh, look. A recline button.
Ohh! Ohh!
Oh, no!
Dudes, what?
Whoa! What?
Oh, look!
Cool light show!
Very Pink Floyd.
No!
They're alarm beams.
Someone has to get through
to the diamond.
But I'm chewing my gum.
I'm a little jumpy.
Didn't y'all hear Brian before?
I'll do it!
I used to be a dancer, you know.
Back when I was on Soul Train,
I had all the moves.
Stop talking, Ermintrude,
and please get me out of here!
Om.
Ohh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah... yow!
Hoo! Ha ha!
I am so fly!
Sweet move!
That was great!
No!
Oops!
Ohh!
Whoa!
Here's Johnny!
Someone order ribs?
Bring out the dead!
Pirates of the Caribbean!
Hey, thought we said
no Disney jokes.
Whassup?
Oh, look, we got
Bone Thugs-n-Harmony up in here.
Ooh! Scary red eyes.
Lookin' all Dawn of the Dead
and everything.
Anybody know karate?
I trained with Morpheus.
I know kung-fu, John Woo,
judo, kendo, tae kwon do,
Wu-Tang Clan, and chai tea.
Ha! Can you teach me
some of that?
Dylan, can you beat them up?
My name is Neo.
Hey, I'm Steve.
There is no spoon.
Aw, man! Steve's down!
Moo!
Uh...
That's what I call
pulling yourself together.
Okay, ready guys?
On three. One... two...
Maybe we shoulda
done that on two.
I have a bone to pick with you.
Behind you!
- What?
- Hey.
It's hammer time.
Ha ha! You know
you can't touch this.
Wax on... wax off!!
Hmm. A good group effort.
Now let's grab the diamond
and head out.
Why do I always get the shaft?
Lucky I have tunnel vision.
Ouch.
Whoa!
Ohh!
So... the fearless warrior of legend
has come to claim the diamond.
Just a couple of Muggles
on our way to Hogwarts,
here for a pickup from
He Who Must Not Be Named.
Is that you, governor?
What? Look, do you want
the diamond or don't you?
Oh. Well, if you're offering.
Yes, please.
I've got a better idea.
Let's jump him.
Cha...
...arge!
It was just a thought.
How about...
run away!
Aah!
Aah! Hey! Hey!
I promise, I won't ever
bury another bone ever again!
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Fiddlesticks!
Way to finally step up, Doogal.
Well done.
Well, if you keep your cool
and try not to freak out,
it's amazing what you can do.
Now let's grab the diamond
and get out of here.
Whoa!
It's gone!
Oh, someone's been watching CSI.
- Now, I'd like to thank the Academy...
- Coming, sir!
Ohh, you just can't get
good help these days.
So, which one of you knuckleheads
wants to tell me where
the third diamond is?
Nope!
Resistance is futile!
It's about to get chilly in here!
You don't want to press our buttons,
right, Doogal?
Aah!
Yeah! That's the last
we'll see of them. Huh?
Hello, sir!
- Aah!
- No!
My fault, sir!
Good thinking, Ermintrude.
Yeah, dude, but we just
flushed away diamonds one and two.
So... what do we do now?
Look at the picture on the wall.
That looks just like
our little carousel back home.
And that looks like a diamond.
That's it!
The third diamond is inside the carousel.
It's been right in our
own backyard this whole time!
And Zeebad has no idea.
That's it. We've got to get
back to the carousel right away.
Since Zeebad's out of commission,
with no hieroglyphic info...
I think it's time for a little siesta.
Guys, look!
What's that?
Voices?
Whoa!
Who's there?
Hey, that sounds familiar!
I'll take familiar
over the Temple of Doom any day.
Let's get out of here.
Oh, slow down!
You're making my milk curdle.
Are you kidding?
We're moving at a snail's pace.
A snail's pace is just fine with me.
Oh, Ermintrude!
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said.
Relax, Doogie.
Soon this whole crazy trip
will be behind us.
Behind us!
- That's what I said, man!
- No, look behind us!
You can't leave.
- Faster!
- Choo-choo-chooing!
Head's up!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa, dudes, talk about
a near-death experience!
I thought I saw the light
at the end of the tunnel!
That is the light at the end of the tunnel!
We're gonna be all right!
And Zeebad's still trapped
in the temple!
Then, like, who's that?
His evil clone, Mini-Zee?
Where's my third diamond?
Very assertive, sir!
Oh, no!
Whoo!
Hang on!
Aah!
Somebody pull a lever
or press a button or something!
Okay. This one
looks like it's for the radio,
this is for the AC,
and this one looks... green.
Aah!
Or it could be an ejector seat.
Aah!
What was that? I think we've been hit!
Where am I?
I've been blinded!
I'll never make it
to the carousel now!
Huh?
So that's where they're headed.
The carousel!
And that is where I'll find
my third and final diamond.
Ha ha ha!
So long, slime ball!
Sam, we've a prisoner up there
we need to dispose of.
Dispose of the prisoner?
We can't do that, sir.
Geneva Convention, sir!
I don't care if it's a Star Trek convention!
Trekkies! Nerd alert!
Beam him out!
Help! Help!
Brian!
Whoa!
- Ow!
- Whoa!
Sorry about that.
Ohh, Ermintrude,
you saved me.
We're gonna lose this race
to Thomas the Tank Engine?
I don't think so!
More coal!
Shoveling as fast as I can, sir!
Whoa!
Trouble, dead ahead!
Fine.
Now it's time to stick it to the man...
to the dog, snail, cow, etc.
You guys know what I mean.
Aah!
Oh, no!
Sir, the pressure!
It's too much!
Sam, I know!
Not to get all Dr. Phil on you,
but you need balance in your life
or you'll just explode!
Funny you should say that, sir.
Ooh! That little blue man
just blew up!
That's the good news.
And the bad news is...
Aah!
I can fly!
No, I can't.
Ohh!
I'm fine.
I broke the fall with my face.
Ermintrude, are you all right?
Well, Brian, I'd have been
better with a shell.
Guys, let's get moving.
At least Zeebad doesn't know
where the last diamond is.
Yeah, that's not exactly true.
Back there on the train,
I was dazed and confused,
and it sort of slipped out.
It slipped out?
Oh, like you've never
been confused before?
Yeah, but it's just...
um, what?
Blaming each other
won't solve anything.
Now let's get on the train.
I think I just pulled a gasket.
Attention, passengers.
We may experience a delay.
Can you put any weight on it?
Ohh.
Ohh! Yeah, I'm out of service.
Well, you did fall
half a mile out the sky.
The sun is setting!
Then you've got to
keep moving without me.
Just keep it elevated, man.
You can make it.
Just follow our tracks.
Don't worry about me.
Wow, that was irritating.
Should have got the insurance.
Sam! Quit loafing around
and let's get moving!
Sorry, sir.
Not doing too well.
Did you, uh, see a bright light?
Yes, Sam, I've seen the light.
It's the light bulb
that went off in my head
that makes me realize I never should have
counted on you in the first place!
As my apprentice, you're fired!
Sorry, sir.
Is there any severance package?
Well, the best I can do
is not freeze you.
Hasta la vista, wood man.
Peace out.
Villains.
They can be so... cruel.
There was no escaping it.
Zeebad's icy grip
was all over the world.
I-I can't feel my limb.
But Florence and the kids.
If we don't make it there soon,
they'll be frozen solid.
In case you haven't noticed,
we are not doing much better, Doogal.
W-well, you know what they say, man.
W-what doesn't kill you
makes you stronger...
or colder.
Look! Footprints.
They're fresh, too.
Maybe they'll lead us back home.
W-well, like,
what kind of freaky creatures
would leave footprints like these?
They must be exhausted, too.
One of them seems to be
crawling along the ground.
I prefer the term "gliding."
Oh, man, they're ours!
And I used to think
that chasing my tail was c-cute.
Well, I'm just gonna
lie down here
on this warm beach
and lay in the sand.
I don't know what to say, Doogal,
but I guess our best
wasn't nearly good enough.
I guess this is curtains, y'all.
No!
We can't give up now.
We're close!
I can feel it.
I told Florence I'd save her.
I promised!
Florence!
Florence.
Uh-oh.
What do we have here?
Hey, check it out.
A little man.
Oh, hello!
You're not going to
sit on me, are you?
Come on! Wake up!
Wake up!
Dylan!
Oh, come on, man.
I was just dreaming that I was
jamming out with McCartney.
We couldn't see
where we were last night,
but look!
Closer than we ever knew!
There's the carousel!
Let's get down there and help Florence!
Home,
sweet frozen home!
That diamond's
got to be here somewhere.
Be easier to find if some idiot
hadn't frozen it solid!
Oh... that was me.
Zeebad!
This wasteland isn't big enough
for the both of us!
Look, when I leave someone for dead,
I expect them to die!
You can't even do that right, can you?
I haven't done anything right
since I left the carousel.
Now it's time
to resume my post!
You? You did something right
on the carousel?
Indeed, sir.
Guarding it from the likes of you.
You, a guard!
You couldn't guard
against underarm odor.
Well, personal hygiene
in the field is difficult.
But it's like Zebedee told me...
it's what's inside that counts.
Charge!
Ohh!
Just like old times, sir.
No!
Ohh! The third diamond!
It's beautiful.
And now it's mine.
Something so priceless
in someone so worthless.
Oh, the irony!
And now, it's time
for the big chill.
Ooh, pretty!
Aah!
Zeebad!
Huh?
Ah, perfect.
You're just in time
for the grand finale!
So long, sunshine!
Heh heh heh!
Ohh.
Florence!
Ohh!
Oh, no! Florence!
Oh, no!
This isn't how it was supposed to end!
I was supposed to be
your knight in furry armor.
Oh! If only I hadn't been
so selfish and stupid!
I guess this is it, Dylan.
Bye-bye, Brian!
Uh, Ermintrude...
before we freeze, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.
This guy... is seriously...
messing with... the wrong...
bunny!
You know that rabbit
done lost his mind, right?
Eat this, you twisted,
jack-in-the-box freak!
You!
Take a chill pill, rabbit!
Holy cow!
Ohh!
Ow! Aah!
Wait a minute! That's it!
Ermintrude, sing!
Sing as loud as you can!
Sing?!
Ooh! Aah!
You always puttin' down my voice,
and now you want a concert?
What, are you crazy?
Aah!
Doogal might be on to something.
Yeah!
Ermintrude, sing!
It's the end of the world,
not karaoke night!
Please, Ermintrude, sing!
Fine!
Aah! Who triggered
the Emergency Broadcast System?
Somebody turn her off!
Yeah!
Let's show him what this
ragtag team can do.
Eat ice!
Are those feet lucky? Run!
Let's jump the moon, Brian!
Whoa! Whoa!
Snail got your tongue?
I just pooped my pants!
Aah!
Doopf!
Dylan, heads up! Quick!
Ow!
Stupid frozen block!
Whoa!
My Axe-calibur!
It's coming!
Whoo-hoo!
Batter up!
No!
Wahoo!
Incoming!
I got it! I got it!
No. It's mine. Mine!
And here I come!
Bend it like Beckham, Ermie!
I'm Number One,
Number One, Number One.
Kick that!
Two to nothing!
The game's not over yet!
Who's got me?
Yaah!
You're on the wrong team, Zeebad.
All that's left is the third...
- Mine!
- diamond!
Called it! No do-overs.
You know what you are?
You're a big blue bully.
He's right, you know.
I think you're just lonely.
Here comes a home run.
No, you're out.
Uhh!
I got it.
You got it? Wait.
Who's got it?
Call it in the air.
- It's mine.
- Quick, get it.
Wait! I got it!
Ha ha!
Victory!
Yes!
So close and yet so...
far out!
Now it's closing time at the zoo.
Not with our secret weapon...
Zebedee's magic box!
- Huh?
- Ha!
Oh.
It does...
doesn't work.
Ooh!
Zebedee's toys
can't help you now!
That was awesome!
Train! You made it!
Uh-oh.
Out of the way.
I got us into this mess,
and I'll get us out.
Get it, Doogal!
This was the moment
when Doogal knew with absolute certainty
that he had to rise to the occasion.
Unh!
Whoa! Whoa!
No!
No!
Whoo-hoo!
We did it! We did it!
Yeah, we did it!
I'll take a soda... no ice.
- Whoo-hoo!
- Nice going!
There's nothing like some hot singing
for thawing things out.
Feels great to be back
in the sweet, sweet sunshine!
Yeah!
But... where's Florence?
Florence?
Oh, no!
Florence!
Florence, please wake up.
Don't leave me like this.
I ran across the entire world for you.
I don't know what I'll do
if I can't see your smile again.
Sorry, old buddy.
No, it can't!
She can't!
Florence!
My best friend Florence!
She moved!
Hmm?
She's alive!
Oh, Florence!
I thought I'd lost you forever!
And I thought I'd
lost you, too, Doogal.
But you saved my life...
and everyone else's.
Oh, stop, please.
It's what any incredibly heroic dog
would do, really.
Oh.
So... saving the world probably
calls for a sweet reward.
What? No, I've learned my lesson.
I'm never touching another lollipop...
or candy bar... or jelly bean...
But wait!
Where's Zebedee?
As we all know,
good magic never really dies.
Ahh!
And a good wizard
will always bounce back.
Zebedee!
Bravo, my friends!
I always knew you could do it!
But we thought you were dead.
Dead? Nonsense, Doogal.
Everyone knows that after winter,
it's time for spring!
Yay!
Sam?
But we can't trust him.
Don't be too hard on him.
Sam, too, was a victim
of Zeebad's maniacal magic.
It's time for you to return
where you belong, Sam.
Ohh!
Back in business!
"B" to the "izzy"!
# Gather round #
# Come and take a trip #
# 'Cause it's all right #
Let's go!
Come on!
Let's go to the carousel!
Come on!
Everything's back to normal, except me.
All right! I'm back!
That's one magic mustache!
Hey, Train, check me out.
# I'm brown, it's my birthday #
# I'm brown, it's my birthday #
With Zeebad defeated
and the world finally safe...
Hello, sir!
... our fellowship
of unlikely heroes
returned to their old lives,
knowing their greatest weapon
had been the simplest...
friendship,
the one thing evil can never destroy.
As for Doogal,
nothing,
not evil villains,
not even a dangerous sweet tooth,
would come between him
and Florence ever again.
Ha ha ha!
Doogal, let's go!
Florence!
One... two... three.
Oh!
Not gonna catch me!
# Sun is shinin' in the sky #
- I got ya!
- Hey, no fair!
# It's not raining #
Let's go see
what everyone's up to.
Hey, it's Doogal!
Just in time for the picnic, of course.
Whoa!
Hey, Florence,
this is great!
# Mr. Blue Sky is living here today #
# Hey #
Oh, Doogal.
# Mr. Blue Sky,
please tell us why #
# You had to hide #
- Catch, Doogal!
- Uh-oh, it's too high!
Too high! No, I've got it!
It's mine!
Comin' through! Hot dog!
Florence, let me try it again.
I know I can catch it.
# Mr. Blue, you did it right #
# But soon comes Mr. Night #
# Creeping over #
# Now his hand is on your shoulder #
# Never mind #
# I'll remember you this way #
Doogal, are you ready?
Just about, Florence.
Okay, everybody get ready.
Hope I set this right.
All right,
everybody say "cheesecake."
I love you, Doogal.
I love you too, Florence.
Hang on! Let's... ho...
My gum came out!
A narrator is a rather grand word,
really, for storyteller.
Ah! This is the only guitar riff I know!
Whoo! Macy-o, Macy-o, Macy-o!
Look at that, I'm great...
I'm average... I'm terrible.
No, I got served.
Come on, we can take 'em!
Charge!
Time for bed.
I mean, I'd turn the pages and I'd think,
"Oh, you're so cute!"
Mmm! Like a rotting Smurf
wrapped in cabbage!
Be easier to find if some idiot
hadn't frozen it solid.
Oh... that was me.
Not me. The only tricks
I know are, "Sit, Doogal,"
and chasing my tail
till I pass out.
Are you saying I represent athletes,
but I'm not an athlete?
Yes!
I've waited 10,000 years
for my revenge.
And you know that's a tush
best served cold.
- Cut!
- I'm sorry, did I say tush?
Cut!
All right, y'all,
beauty sleep time.
Not that I need it.
She's a cow.
I am a cow.
I felt a connection, cow to cow.
- Double-Dutch!
- Double-Dutch!
We thought you was good that way!
# Both you and me #
# A magical feeling #
Don't look down.
I just pooped my pants!
Rock 'n' roll, dude!
Whoo!
I wish I could tell you
I've played a snail before,
but I really haven't.
Don't worry.
I speak Moose, everyone.
Hey, buddy...
Ma-ma say, ma-ma sah,
ma-ma ma soo kah.
- I can't do that.
- Cut!
Don't expect
Robin Williams-type stuff.
I'm sorry, did you say
"fu" or "pooh"?
I'm a bad cow!
Need some water.
Hang on!
I saw it in a movie once.
As a wise man once said,
that's all, folks.
# Roundabout #
# Off on an adventure,
we're coming to get ya #
# Wherever that may be #
# I won't let anything
come here and upset ya #
# Gonna set you free #
# Whatever happens along the way #
# It's gonna be fine #
# Oh, yeah #
# Come and take a trip #
# 'Cause it's all right #
# So join in with the fun #
# The ride has just begun #

# You're #
# Simply wonderful #
# And in my mind,

# Yes, in my mind,
you catch me every time I fall #
# Simply wonderful #
# You're everything I need #

Oh!
Oh, you're still there!
Didn't I tell you?
Time for bed!
