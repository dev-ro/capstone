{\an8}[Woman] Throw the first stone. Sure.
{\an8}But this is my story,
and I did it for the right reasons.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. [chuckles] Listen.
{\an8}I'm not gonna soft-pedal what we did.
And by "we"...
{\an8}You know, I'm not gonna name names,
except for Liza Drake.
[Pete] Are you talking to her?
Okay. Well, what you need to remember
is that, you know,
we're not Purdue Pharma.
We didn't kill America.
This is 2011, and strictly speaking,
we weren't even part of the opioid crisis.
You know, Lonafen was never a street drug.
But, you know, people hear "fentanyl"
and, you know,
they lose all fucking perspective.
"Ooh, you sold fentanyl?"
Like, I'm El Chapo or something.
{\an8}You wanna know who did fentanyl?
{\an8}Your mother.
And let me tell you, it saved my bacon
when Liza, like, blew out my pelvis
with her giant baby head.
Liza Drake?
{\an8}[sighs wearily]
{\an8}Well, she invented me.
{\an8}On the one hand, there were times
I wanted her to die in a plane crash,
and other times
where I wished she would die
in a slower, more painful way.
Look, the thing about Liza is,
she didn't give a fuck...
about anybody.
And in that way she was like family to me.
[cell phone ringing]
[Liza] What do you want, Randy?
- [Randy] I wouldn't antagonize me, Liza.
- Why not?
I'm trying to keep this amicable
for the sake of my daughter.
"My daughter."
Love how you say that. Really makes it
sound like you showed up. Ever.
- What are you talking about?
- What the fuck?
Bring Phoebe back to Savannah yesterday,
and I'll give you every third weekend.
[Liza] Why? Phoebe doesn't want that.
You don't even want it.
Up here she's got a beautiful home
on a half-acre lot with beach access,
and you got... a car.
- Take me out of it.
- Ugh.
Are you at a bar?
Not really.
- Liza!
- I gotta go, Randy.

It's one fucking script,
what's the big deal, Jimmy?
- A hundred mics!
- I know it. Take it light, now.
- Jimmy!
- Come on, man.
- [Pete] You gonna call me tomorrow?
- [Jimmy] Not likely.
- Fuck!
- Hi, there.
[sighs]
I'll save you the trouble.
I'm not in the mood for a lap dance.
Me neither,
I just had to get off that stage.
- Still not gonna pay for a lap dance.
- Still not selling you one, dude.
Wanna play a game?
Wanna play a game with me? Just one game.
Bet you ten bucks I can peg you.
Well, you can try, but... fair warning.
I wrestled in high school.
[chuckles]
Okay, so...
if you're in this shithole,
you're not finance.
I'd say insurance,
except your Ferragamos are too nice.
So I'm guessing cars.
Or you're a drug rep.

- [mimics chomping]

Like fucking Pac-Man.
And I realize
this mild-mannered deacon is trying to,
how shall I say,
bite my fucking dick off.
Your dad tried to bite your dick off?
Oh, it wasn't like that.
It was like a fucking...
foster guy.
That is... awful.
It's a terrible story.
Well, [sighs] there's a happy ending.
Knocked couple teeth down his throat
before he got the goods.
[Liza] Yeah?
Sir!
Listen.
I'm sure some asshole
says this every shift,
but I can take you out of here.
Take yourself home in one piece,
we'll be good. Okay?
- Destiny! Phone call.
- Gotta go.
- Gotta go.
- Listen, listen, listen. I like you. Okay?
Come work for me.
[Liza chuckles]
I'll put 100k in your pocket this year.
- Really?
- Yeah.
[man] Hey, phone call!
If I'm lying, you can kiss me
anywhere you want on this perfect body.
Destiny, phone call!
[school bell rings]
[Liza panting]
- Oh my God, what happened?
- Mom, I'm so sorry.
It's okay, baby.
- No, I'm sorry.
- What happened?
It was stupid,
and now they're gonna kick us out.
No one's kicking you out.
We're good. Oh my gosh, what happened?
I'm sorry, Miss Drake, but if this isn't
an expulsion-worthy offense,
I don't know what is.
What's the offense, exactly?
[scoffs] Take your pick.
Bringing illegal fireworks
into the school.
[Liza] Okay. Sorry. Just to clarify,
those weren't
technically fireworks or illegal.
I bought 'em at Circle K.
[principal] It's not the point.
Your daughter endangered the safety
of every student in school.
[Phoebe] Shoot, okay.
Can I push back?
I feel no other kids were in danger.
They were across the street.
They weren't on property.
Let's take it from there.
Leaving school without permission.
[Liza] Yep. Sure did.
And I looked it up in the discipline code,
and you could let that go
with a warning if you wanted to.
[principal] Or five-day suspension.
Oh my gosh.
Do you wanna do one day?
Which, I think, still seems harsh,
but I'm good to close there.
- [siren wailing]

No one is looking at you, Jeff.
Dude, as a matter of fact,
could you please...
Lis, it's fine. It's gonna be fine. Okay?
They canned me for walking off my shift,
so I'm gonna be around.
- Wow. That was fast, even for you.
- You insult me and fucking belittle me...
Can I just point out you said one week?
It's been two months.
I'm so sorry for the wear and tear
on your garage couch. All right?
And I won't even mention the money.
You just did, so. You'll get your cash.
- All right? You'll get it.
- Wonderful. Great!
- How?
- Soon!
[Jackie] It just so happens, Andy,
that your sister and I
are about to do very well for ourselves.
Oh, cool. Cool. Um...
Webcamming? Or identity theft?
Liza has invented something to market
my skincare products that is so cool.
- So smart. So creative.
- Please don't, no.
Oh, I will because it's amazing.
It's an app.
And it'll have a gizmo thing
{\an8}where you take a picture of your face
and you upload it.
Analyzes your skin type,
and it curates a regimen
of Mom's products. It's pretty cool.
[Andy] Wow.
- You must have spent hours on that.
- [Liza] I did, actually.
And the tech
is so much bigger than cosmetics.
It's like interior design,
it's telemedicine.
[Andy] Wait, you're a tech genius now?
Liza, your life is on fire.
Go fuck yourself, Andy!
You know what?
Get the fuck out of my house!
- Fine!
- [Andy] I'm done! I'm just done!
- She doesn't mean it.
- [Liza] She does.
- No...

This is Liza Drake.
Uh, it was my pleasure
to make your acquaintance, uh, yesterday.
Hope you're feeling all right. Um...
[mouth clicks]
I'm calling about the employment offer
that, that, that you offered yesterday.
Um, so if you want to
call me back at this number,
that would be awesome, be wonderful.
I hope you have a really wonderful day.
And...
Okay, bye-bye.

- [sighs] Momma.
- [Jackie chuckles]
Oh, you're gonna get through this. Yes.
Yes, you will.
It's who you are.
[Pete] Look, it's not about money.
I mean, it is, because you're gonna be
backing the biggest IPO of the year.
So what's it about?
It's about after you retire and look back,
you'd be able to say,
"I wasn't just... a banker."
"I was a hero."
If it's such a terrific medication,
why is your market penetration under 1%?
Because we don't have
the money to compete.
{\an8}This is Praxiom.
They own the breakthrough pain sector
with a fentanyl lollipop
that is so toxic and ineffective,
it's our moral duty to horsefuck 'em.
This shit rots your teeth
and takes 45 minutes to kick in.
Lonafen takes five.
We come on like the Navy SEALS.
And when your bones
are on fire from cancer pain,
those five minutes are a godsend.
But your Binaca blaster thing,
it's fentanyl, isn't it?
The stuff that killed Ohio?
No. The Hartigan study out of Mass General
puts the risk of addiction
and overdose at less than 1%.
$35 million,
that's Zanna's current debt level?
[Pete] Actually, $80 million down
was current.
All from the pocket of this guy,
Dr. Jack Neel,
pharma's fuzziest billionaire.
If you consider
a market penetration forecast
post IPO of 22, maybe even 26%...
[Pete] Soon to be bankrupt thanks to this
fine-tuned hard pass factory,
our CEO, Eric Paley.
We'll say a market floor of $1 billion.
As you'll note in our SEC disclosure,
our efforts to educate prescribers
face challenges
in the areas of, uh, capitalization...
[Pete] Brent Larkin, VP of marketing,
a backstabbing snake
hired for his bionic ability
to make you wanna buy the opposite
of whatever he was selling.
We spent the last year
fighting for a promotion to COO.
The marketing spend of $10 million
could achieve
an adequate level of acceptance
from physicians,
patients, third-party payers
to make Lonafen profitable.
[man] Listen, I'm sorry.
It doesn't matter
if that thing squirts liquid Jesus.
Nobody's prescribing it.
At this point, Doctor,
the way that you get whole
is to sell that patent to someone
with a war chest to break into market.
[cell phone ringing]
Sorry.
[woman] Right?
Who's that?
She's a sales lady from J&J. Excuse me.
Wha... Uh, are we not
under a hiring freeze?
Mr. Brenner, Liza Drake.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry just to show up.
- I did try calling...
- The address isn't on the card.
I called the secretary of state,
and they pulled the corporate files.
I thought about it.
I'd like to take you up on your offer.
You got a résumé?
- Yeah!
- Come on.
- Only two years of high school?
- Well, I left to pursue a career in sales.
- Cutco? Steak knives door to door?
- Yeah!
- It was other kinds of knives too.
- Mm-hmm.
- Amway, Avon, Mary Kay.
- Mm-hmm.
President of Green Rock Enterprises.
What's that?
Uh, the model
was to upcycle biocharred hog waste
into a sustainable drywall product.
It was pretty cool.
- You made sheetrock out of dried pig shit?
- Almost. Yeah.
You own a restaurant in Savannah?
How'd that pan out?
It's doing good.
It's doing solid numbers for my ex.
[quietly] Come on, Mr. Brenner,
give me a shot.
Give me a shot, please.
[quietly] Come on. Give me a shot.
- You got a Word file of this?
- Yeah.
Here you go.

Hi.
I just read your Pharma Quarterly piece.
It was, um...
I'm such a fan!
Very nice of you to say.
Nice to meet you.
Hmm. [groans]
[Liza] Oh.
All right.
- The pleasure is mine.
- Of course. Yes.
Well...
Is that your wife? Wow.
Beautiful smile.
[Jack] Yes. Thank you.
I suppose you know the story?
- I would love to hear it from you.
- Well...
- Forty years we were married...
- Wow.
...and Zanna was a breath of life for me.
She truly was.
Yeah.
But then she was diagnosed
with liver cancer,
and although I could accept
that she would die...
the fact that she was gonna die
not only in pain,
but in fear of pain,
that I could not accept.
So that's why I developed Lonafen,
so I can give other cancer patients
the kind of help
that I could not give my own wife.
Right.
Full disclosure, you're gonna be

[woman] Lonafen
is a revolutionary medication
for the treatment
of breakthrough cancer pain.
A two-year independent clinical trial
out of Massachusetts General Hospital
conducted by Dr. Elliot Hartigan
found that the risks
for both overdose and dependency
for patients using Lonafen
were less than 1%.
Lonafen is the world's first
sublingual fentanyl spray.
It is applied under the tongue
where the sublingual artery
absorbs the medication
into the bloodstream in just five minutes.
That's the fastest relief
a patient can get without a needle.
- What are you doing?
- When patients experience spiking pain...
Uh, it's a drug rep chatroom.
"What are some tips and tricks
for starting out in pharma sales?"
Okay.
- "Dear noob, a low-cut blouse..."
- No.
- "...and a push-up bra..."

"...has been the standard

- No! Stop! Stop it!
- No, no, no, no!

Lair of the one Dr. Nathan Lydell,
$9 million man.
That's how much he wrote
for the competition last year.
Oh, wow. Sketch-a-rama, jeez.
That, my friends, is the $9 million man.
Guys, here's the deal.
It's safer than aspirin.
And because it works faster,
you can reduce other pain meds.
So they're not so zonked out all the time.
So they can be here, be present, right?
"It's a gift."
"It's a blessing."
That's what we're hearing.
From patients and their families.
How about it, Doctor?
Incredible.
Well, if you got some patients in mind,
we can leave some coupons. Circle back...
No, this stuff. What's it called?

[Dr. Lydell] Hey, she's alive.
Did you not get my call?
Oh, Nate. I am so sorry.
We were on a work retreat
to Turks and Caicos,
but next time, you are coming with me.
Come on, I have so much to tell you about.
Let's go to your office.
[indistinct conversation]
I thought the pitch went well.
- Doesn't matter. Praxiom owns him.
- Why? 'Cause she got macaroons?
[mouths] Fuck you.
Because she reminds him of a girl
he used to jerk off to in high school,
except now he holds the cards.

I'd like to talk about Lonafen again.
It is the fastest-acting
breakthrough pain medication.
- It is five minutes, the onset...
- I will get back to you.
45 minutes faster than Xeraphen.
Dr. Bowen, you're missing out!
Dr. Chen's all booked today.
Could you please just show her
the clinical trial, please? Please.
Or I can just
leave her with some of these.
I mean, we have so much fun stuff here.
I love these pens. They're so hilarious.
- Where are you from?
- Zanna Therapeutics.
Want some for your kids?
No, I mean, don't you know
the industry banned this stuff years ago?
Dr. Lanning, I was wondering, sir,
if I could pitch you...
[woman] Good morning, Doctor.
Oh, he'll be just a moment.
- Okay.
- Thank you so much for waiting.
All right.
It's okay. You tried.
She's horrible.
Yeah.
Pheeb?
Pheeb, are you good?
- Yeah, why?
- You were staring.
Oh.
[indistinct chatter]
What's up, girl? Hey.
Hi.
Sorry. So...
- [clattering]
- [woman shrieks]
Oh my God.
It's all right. She's okay.
It's okay.
She just needs some space. She's fine.
[nurse] Is there anything I can get you?
It's okay. She's just having a seizure.
She's fine. She's okay.
It's okay, honey. Look at Mom.
Look at Momma. It's okay, baby.
I got you. I got you. I got you.
It's okay, baby. It's okay.
So, Phoebe, you got something going on?
Yeah, I got epilepsy going on.
Well, epilepsy is a general diagnosis
for "Phoebe's gets seizures,
but we don't really know why."
I know why. This guy.
- That's a tumor.
- It's not a tumor. It's not cancer.
Uh, we call it AVM,
arteriovenous malformation.
It's a little tangle of blood vessels,
and when the blood backs up,
it swells, and you get a seizure.
So, what do we do?
Well, I'm hoping nothing.
This thing's small and looks stable,
and sometimes childhood AVMs
get straightened out during puberty.
Ugh, gross.
Um, what if it doesn't?
We'll probably need to get him out.
Option A,
which is a fine option, a full craniotomy.
[Liza] I.e., cut open Phoebe's skull
and scoop out the not-a-tumor
with a melon baller.
Or option B...
...is a keyhole procedure,
where we go in through the nose.
Lower risk, minimally invasive,
we don't have to retract the brain...
[Liza] The only hitch,
the non-melon baller option
wasn't covered by Medicaid.
And they don't cover the keyhole option,
the radiation, or the post-op therapy.
But for now,
unless there's another seizure,
dizziness, headaches,
I don't need to see you for six months.
Meantime, Phoebe,
I want you getting plenty of rest,
staying on top of your meds,
and Mom, do what we can
to keep things calm and stable at home.
[rap music blasting]

So you want me to live with evil people.

- Yeah, well, Diana is.
- She's fine.
No, she's not fine, Mom.
You know what?
She says evil stuff about you.
Yeah? What'd she say?
- She...
- What does she say? Say it.

She says that you're...
you're a loser and a... leech,

No, no, unacceptable!
I paid for five days...
It only took four to get turned down
by every whale in the state.
Well, then you get
turned down again! Okay?
I own you until five o'clock!
I'm taking Phoebe
up to her dad's in Savannah.
Well, luckily,
Savannah is not going anywhere!
You are holding the bag
until five o'clock,
or I will incinerate your fucking life!
I will drag your ass
through small claims court. I will...
Hello?
[Phoebe] What are we doing?
[Liza] We're just gonna cool out
for 12 minutes. All right?
- Why?
- Because, so I don't get sued.
Just chill, baby, please.
Okay? Please.
Okay.
[Phoebe] Oh, hey, it's Dr. Sketchball.
Keep the doors locked.
[Dr. Lydell] No,
this is a circular conversation
that I'm getting really tired of having.
This is what I keep saying.
The prenup is airtight on spousal support.
Where is she getting 40%?
Just... Just... No. Nope.
Lucky lady. My ex took the business.
Hey.
- It's apple slump.
- Don't worry.
I'm not gonna pitch you.
I came for my Tupperware. That all right?
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.
[Kate] Baby. If you don't tell him
about the side effects, I will.
[Matt] I don't want to get into it.
It is what it is.
- Hey, Matt, what's new, man?
- The mouth sores are new.
- [Dr. Lydell] It's okay.
- Nothing's okay. He can barely talk.
He walks around like a zombie all the time
because he's always
sucking on this lollipop
and it never works. He's always in pain.
[Dr. Lydell] Sounds like we should think
about stepping down the Xeraphen dosage.
That might be a good idea.
[Matt] Can I just get outta here, please?
- Are you in pain? The mouth sores...
- [Matt] No!
[Dr. Lydell] Hold tight. One sec.
- Excuse me.
- Don't get the question.
I accidentally overheard you.
Why didn't you help him?
- What's your name again?
- Liza Drake.
All the complaints,
the mouth sores, the onset time,
is exactly where Lonafen would be better.
I'm not trying to sell you.
I'm done with it.
It just makes no fucking sense to me.
Why is nobody
willing to prescribe a better drug?
- Why? I don't understand.
- Listen...
Liza, the truth is,
you can't just switch patients
every time there's a new medication.
- Xeraphen is a known quantity.
- Known to be terrible. She just told you.
- I don't know that Lonafen is different.
- You won't even give it a shot.
Excuse me...
What are you talking about?
[Dr. Lydell] It's chemically identical
to what you're already taking,
but... the onset time is purportedly faster
and should help you with your mouth sores.
Yeah, I don't know.
[Matt] I didn't.
All I knew was I was scared, all the time.
And I'm not a frightened person.
I was a Navy corpsman, by the way.
Greenside in Iraq.
I saw some things,
got through some sporty situations,
but I was never afraid.
Never had a bad dream.
But when I got sick, bro...
I was in mortal fucking terror.
[Matt] To keep that hurt
from sneaking up on you,
you get to where
you want to stay juiced up all the time.
[boy] Mom...
can we please get something to eat?
Lobby now.
- But, Mom...
- Lobby... now!
Yeah, okay.
Okay?
We'll have to start you back
at 100 micrograms
and see if we need
to titrate you up from there.
First couple weeks will be rocky.
[upbeat music playing]
[Eric] All right, everyone.
Obviously, we're all looking
at the same numbers,
so you probably already know
what I'm about to say.
- But the point is...
- No.
Okay, well, to bring down overhead
through this next little stretch...
- Nice power suit. What's up?
- Nothing.
I just... got a script.
- Who?
- Dr. Lydell in Lakeland.
- Wow.
- [Brent] Bullshit.
I did.
- Check it.
- [Catherine] Checking it.
- 100 mics. Big fucking deal.
- That is a big fucking deal.
That's my nine million-dollar man,
and Liza got him pregnant.
- Think he's pregnant?
- I think he's pretty pregnant.
He told you explicitly
he's gonna write more Lonafen?
He said he wanted to join
our speaker program, so I said, "Great."
You said we had a speaker program?
No, I said Dr. Lydell's
gonna launch our speaker program,
and it's gonna be amazing.
Speaker programs
are pharma's dirty little secret,
minus the little and secret.
What's a speaker program?
It's where you fly prescribers
to Hawaii, Pebble Beach,
and if you're doing it by the book,
you get some asshole
to speed read a slide deck
so everyone can get back
to hitting on drug reps and getting drunk.
And then they fly home
and they write your drug.
It's a legal grift,
and everybody was doing it.
And we would have too.
But we were broke.
Hotels, flights, catering.
- Who's gonna book it? Kathy gonna book it?
- It's Catherine.
I don't think it needs to be
a fancy boondoggle.
He drives a PT Cruiser,
going through divorce, and lonely.
He'd be psyched
to hold court at a taco stand.
No fucking way.
[sighs]
[cash register ding]
[Brent] The issue with this right here
is that these floors are warped.
So it's probably gonna take a curve
up in here, and then...
[Liza] I have an idea.
What if fuck Brent Larkin?
Love that? How?
We do the event on the cheap,
pay for it out of pocket.
Nah...
- Why not?
- I don't want my dick on a chopping block.
I mean cheap-cheap.
We kick in, like, 400 bucks apiece.
A ten-point commission
on $9 million a year.
Dumbass doesn't get any of it.
- Come on.
- I don't know.
What don't you know?
As a wise man once said,
it's a lottery ticket.
He's got to have the grit
to scratch his balls.
[Brent] Look at that panel.
You're gonna hear that nice ding.
- You're gonna hear it ding.
- I like you.
- [golf ball dings]
- [Brent] Oh!
[laughs] Whoo!
Good.
[dramatic music playing]
Hey!
Saved you a seat.
Where are the doctors?
Half of them couldn't make it,
and the rest are no-shows.
Oh, fuck!
- What about Lydell?
- Well...
I was gonna call him
and tell him not to come,
but since he's your kill,
I'll give you the pleasure.
No. We are holding this event.
Liza, us shitting the bed
and rolling around in it is the event.
We got the room, the food!
Yeah, and a sign-in sheet
that has to have prescribers' names on it.
Or we get a visit from the Feds.
[dramatic music playing]
Hi! Is anyone here a doctor?
I'm a podiatrist.
He's a quack. I'm a podiatrist.
Do you want to have some ribs
and wine with me?
I think I do.
Yeah? You too?
[man laughing]
Leeza. Hey, Leeza!
I thought we were gonna hang out! Come on!
- I'll be right there.
- Hey, where you going?
I am so sorry, Liza.
There was a wreck on the 4.
No problem. No problem at all.
Did everybody leave?
Dr. Lydell, I understand.
Listen. Hey, how is Matt?
- Who? What? Who's Matt?
- Your patient. Is Lonafen working for him?
- What?
- How is he?
Come on. Tell me.
I saw him yesterday. [exhales]
He said, "Doc, I oughta fuck you up
for not switching me six months ago."
[Matt] No bullshit.
That stuff did just like she said.
Gave me my life back for a minute.
Are you gonna take him off it now?
I won't take advice from someone who threw
a speakers' program nobody attended...
It was a shitshow. I understand.
Listen, you deserve a big event.
Huge, huge.
- Other doctors need to hear you speak.
- Those guys?
Not those guys.
They're podiatrists. The industry.
The industry... needs to hear that
even though Praxiom think they own you,
like they own everyone else in the state,
you wrote what was right for your patient.
I wrote your drug.
- What else do you want from me?
- Come on.
I want to know how to get doctors
to write the best drug. How?
And get paid?
Goddamn right.
It's how the market should work.
It's rotten right now.
Help me change it.
Come on. Help me change it.
How?
I don't know.
It starts with some cold ribs
and some shit-faced podiatrists.
[Dr. Lydell] I said,
"I'm not pre-diabetic."
- "I just want a colonoscopy."
- [all laughing]
[Liza] That was it. Market penetrated.

And so I knew.
I knew she was gonna marry the guy.
Aw. So sorry, Nate.
[Liza] By the way, I did nothing illegal.
Pete took care of that.
We'll scale your fee
according to your clinical experience.
My clinical experience?
We can give you $1,500
per speaking engagement,
three per week,
if you switch
all your Xeraphen patients to Lonafen.

Everyone else on the road's doing 80.
We just launched the best
cancer pain med the world's ever seen,
so who gives a fuck?
But if they're that good,
why do we have to pay him?
If we don't, someone else will.
Big pharma's about finding that gray line,
getting close without crossing over.
- What happens if we go over?
- You get a speeding ticket. A fine.
It's baked into the marketing budget.
- We don't have a marketing budget!
- We will! Jesus Christ, Liza!
You just saved the company!
You're gonna help
thousands of cancer patients!
Three weeks ago,
you're working at the titty shack,
and now you're a pharma legend!
Be happy!
I'm happy! Yeah, yeah.
It was fun! Told you cheap would work.

Okay, you too.

I'm not gonna pawn it.

This is really...
Wow.
You're not gonna make 100k this year.
It's gonna be more like 600.

It's weird, right?
You happy?
What's going on? Something wrong?
Well, whatever, a deal's a deal, right?
Gonna let you kiss me anywhere you want.
Although fair warning,

a very high addiction rate.
Thank you.
[Jackie] Fuck.
- [banging at door]
- Ugh, what?
[banging continues]
Hi, Mom, your car crapped out.
[Jackie] Liza. Wow.
It's yours.
- No.
- Yes.
No, I can't.
Sell it. Buy a moped. I don't care.
- Take it.
- It's quite... Liza!
- Take it!
- Oh, my...
- Oh, Liza. My...
- You happy?
Oh my God, yes.
That's too... Oh, thank you!
Get your ass in it!
Oh! Thank you! [giggles]
It's so shiny! [chuckles]
[car lock beeps]
With interest.
- Hey, I...
- [Jackie] Okay.
How are you making this kind of money?
Well, it's a 10% commission
on total net sales. So, that's how...
So you just walk in off the street,
and all of a sudden, you're...
Start bringing pain relief
to cancer patients in agony.
Is that a problem?
Is that a bummer?
Be happy.
[Brent] You two are fucking voided.
You are roasted on a goddamn spit.
- All right.
- Grab your shit and go. Seriously.
- Grouchy Gary.
- Meany bear.
I expressly forbade you
from hosting a speaker program.
Why do you hate speaker programs?
What I hate are insubordinate shitheels
who'd risk the reputation of this company.
This company has no reputation
'cause you never risk shit.
You can't just fucking do this!
You need a compliance team
- to vet the speaker...
- [Pete] Let's hire one!
...who might be a pill mill operator
- with the DEA up his ass!
- Lydell's not running a pill mill.
And you'd know
if you ever actually carried the bag.
Fine! Wait for Dr. Jack
to throw you out a window
when I tell him what you did.
What we did, Brent,
is $200,000 net this week
with one fucking doctor.
Not to distract you from getting us fired.
No, no, no. I mean, obviously,
these numbers are encouraging.
I need to think about how to position
the program with the boss.
- You mean how to take credit.
- We told Jack. He's cool with it.
Okay.
Yeah, we're greenlit
to pilot the program in the southeast.
We're staffing up.
Check it out.
[upbeat music playing]
Want to tell us a bit about yourself?
Yes! Pre-med at UF, Phi Beta Kappa.
Interned at Merck.
I was a Pfizer junior leader there.
- Yes.
- No.
Says you got your pharmacy degree
from Amherst.
- I didn't know they had a pharmacy school.
- Yep. One of the best.
Remind me. What's their mascot?
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.
What's your story, for real?
[Maria] All right. For real.
[chuckles nervously] Um...
Out of school I sold tires...
for minimum wage plus commission,
which my manager kept.
Um, I did that for ten years, quit,
and now I do the same sort of shit
selling shower doors.
Um, CPAP machines, hot tubs...
Parakeets, essential oils,
these pump-up penis things.
Body shots. Lap dances.
My own dignity.
Why do you want to sell pharmaceuticals?
When the child support is late,
my kid doesn't eat.
So I can stop lying to my kids
about what I do for a living.
What makes you think
you can close a doctor with our drug?
It's a best-in-class medication
with one-tenth the onset time
of the competition.
Because, for a 10% commission,
I'd eat flaming razor blades.
Because I'm banging an oncologist
in Plant City.
I did field marketing for Malibu Rum,
and I was Miss Hawaiian Tropic, Pensacola.
- Hell no.
- Sweet Jesus, yes.
Come on.
Because my dad's a pain doc,
and he said he'll write your drug
if you hire me.
[Liza] 67 in a 65?
Welcome to the team.
Hell to the motherfucking no.
You can hire the sex toy
if I can hire my mom.
You'll regret it.
So will you.
Dr. Jack's rule.
PhDs only.
Well, none of them are PhDs.
"Poor, hungry, and dumb."
In your case,
the "D" stood for "desperate."
[Liza] What you do today...
informs who you're gonna be tomorrow.
You got to work it
like your fucking back's against the wall.
You don't just work the territory,
you own your territory.
Okay? You own your territory.
You own a territory, you own a doctor.
- You own your territory, you own a doctor.
- [all] Own a doctor.
- You own your territory, you own a doctor!
- Own a doctor!
- Own a territory!
- You own a doctor!
[Liza] We lived or died
by the clinic gatekeepers,
and there's nothing
a 50-year-old desk nurse
hates more than a young hot thing
half her age pulling twice her salary.
Look, lady, I need to know
when I get to see the doctor.
Hey, Sonya. How are you?
- Good to see you.
- Hey.
{\an8}[Liza] Greasing doctors is an art,
not a science.
Every drug company's
trying to put money in their hands.
You can't just throw checks at 'em.
They all think you're wearing a wire.
- I'm just not quite sure...
- [Nicole] That you can trust me?
[scoffs]
Doctor, I have two mortgages,
three kids, one with special needs.
If you join our speakers bureau,
you would be my partner and my lifeline.
I will walk through fire to protect you.
[cash register ding]
[woman] Thank you for sharing, Doctor.
[Liza] And never forget.
Always hire a rep with versatility.
[moaning]
[Jackie] Hey, come with me?
Just this first time.
Nope, it's time
to spread your wings, little bird.
You got this.
[Liza] And while our blue-chip competitors
were fighting over
the marquee MDs at the Mayo Clinic...
Dr. Davis?
Jackie Drake from Zanna.
...we were going after the guys
Pfizer wouldn't toss a free pen.
How you doing?
Well, I'm... doing especially well
right now, thank you.
And without that platoon
of desperate reps,
we'd have never hit our gold mine
of desperate doctors.
- Thank you all for coming.
- [cork pops]
[Liza] The real education at our events
was us learning the doctors
were just as greedy
and horny as everyone else.
["I Like to Move in the Night"
by Eagles of Death Metal playing]
What made us different?
I'd tell my reps, like,
don't treat your doctor like a sale.
Be family to them. Be a friend.
[Liza] We'd pick 'em up at the airport.
Walk their dogs.
Sit through a folk-rock serenade
if that's their thing.
They needed us.
- So real and thick.
- It takes some getting used to.
- But I like it.
- Yeah?
I like the way it makes me feel.
I walk a little faster, little taller.
[Liza] Got a skip in your step.
Fancy seeing you here.
Smells great.

[Liza] 67 in a 65.
I mean, maybe we pushed it to 70,
but that's what it would take
to storm the castle,
to get the best-in-class medication
to people who needed it.
It wasn't pretty, but hey, we won.
In one quarter, we'd gone from zero
to 86% market share in the southeast.
[all cheering]
Own the doctor!
[all] Own your destiny!
[all cheering]
[mouthing]
[Liza] And even if we won dirty,
at the end of the day,
our medicine was reaching the people
who really needed it.
What's remarkable? On Saturday, I said,
"Kids, we're gonna do something."
"Mommy is out of pain."
We went hiking, if you can believe that.
I couldn't.
[nurse] The doctor
will see you now, Sidney.
[Liza] Everyone was happy.
Well, except the competition.
[Liza] Mmm.
Feel good about yourself?
Stealing my doctors?
Feel great getting cancer patients
off your toxic lollipop.
You think you're big shit, huh?
You're a joke.
Everybody's laughing about
your off-brand speaker programs
you're holding at the nudie bar.
Almost as funny as your programs
that are banned 'cause you're crooks.
That just means we can devote
our entire marketing budget
to destroy your little peon asses.
- Y'all woke the dragon.
- Dragon's in the marketing department?
- He's in the butt-fucking department.
- Ooh.
And he's gonna love you.
[Liza] Can't wait. Hi, Dr. Lydell!
Enjoy your macaroons.
- Have you been using that elliptical?
- Sure bet.
- You look so good.
- Working my way up to a 5k.
[Liza] And if you're wondering why Praxiom
didn't just win back their prescribers
with better programs, more money,
they couldn't.
[Laurene] Pain is pain.
Arthritis, post-op...
Pain is pain, people. And at...
[Liza] The Feds had nailed their asses
for off-label marketing,
aka, paying doctors to prescribe fentanyl,
not just to opioid tolerant
cancer patients,
but to whoever, for whatever.
Headaches, hangnails.
"Here, have some fentanyl."
So how's the law
protecting you from these scumbags?
They're not.
Praxiom didn't get shut down.
Nobody did a day of jail time.
The judge hit 'em with a standard fine,
and they banned them
from greasing doctors...
for five years.
[upbeat music playing]
Oh my God.
[Phoebe] Wow.
- I could be comfortable here.
- [chuckles]
[Phoebe] Well, it's two stories,
and I do have my own bedroom now.
[Randy] The company condo?
You're still paying rent, though?
[Phoebe] Yeah.
I mean, big picture, though,
my closet is bigger than my old room.
We have a fizzy tub, by the way,
and my new best friend
is the Gulf of Mexico.
- [Randy] Wow!
- Hello. [chuckles]
It's cool, right?
[Randy] Yeah, it looks great.
Uh... Say hi to Mom.
- Hi.
- [Randy] Hi.
- Oh my Lord.
- Oh my gosh.
- All right, come on.
- [Phoebe] Can you believe this place?
[Liza] Hi.
- [laughs] Thank you. Wow.
- Mmm.
- We use the wool for textile arts...
- [Liza] Mmm.
...and the manure works wonders
for our gardenia glade.
- Where do I sign?
- [chuckles]
I hate to ask, but we have 80 applications
for five spots in the seventh year.
How much are you willing to pay?
Oh, I can pay full tuition.
[Liza] Money's dignity.
Not having to beg for a break.
Can't tell you what it meant
to finally be one of those people
you can't shame, shake down, or fuck over.
- Could you pay enhanced tuition?
- What's enhanced tuition?
Double.
Why would I pay double?
Well, the school
took on some debt to buy the animals,
so to keep the program,
we're having to reach out
to our community.
[Liza] And then
you climb a couple tax brackets,
and it's the same old grift,
only for more money,
and it smells like gardenias
and alpaca shit.
Double it is.
Mmm.
[Liza] Hi.
[Jackie] Hey.
- [Liza] Oh my God.
- What?
Where there's a popcorn tower, there's you
asking me to do something fucked up.
- Oh. Ever heard of just being nice?
- Sure.
I'm a little honked off
about the speaker programs.
I know, they're fucking gross
and over the line,
and after the IPO, we'll bring them
into compliance. All good.
No. I love the events,
when they let me do one.
- Mom.
- But Pete's been giving my speaker money
to that girl who makes sales calls
in her underwear.
You bonused 30 grand.
You're doing all right.
Tina boasts 125.
I have a really early meeting
with Dr. Jack, and I need to focus.
- It's important I get my head around it.
- Okay, even better.
Tell him that I think we should
deduct honorariums from net sales.
Then I'd probably be, like,
number one on my team.
- Okay.
- I'm serious.
I will think about it.
Thank you.
[Jackie] Hi!
- [Phoebe] Hey.
- [Jackie] You need help?
[Phoebe] I guess so.
Do you read French?
Your mom never asked you for a favor?
No. Dead.
Okay, your dad.
Him too.
God, Pete, I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
They would have been shitty grandparents.
They what?
Really? Would have thought she leaked it.
Tina's knocked up.
So the moral of quarter three,
$96 million in the Southeast.
The speaker programs work.
And if the 86% market share metric scales,
which it will,
implementing
the speaker programs nationwide,
we'll be within spitting distance
of a billion a year.
[chuckles]
Minus half a billion in fines
for any kickback violations.
Uh, no, because, as Pete mentioned,
post IPO we'll be running the programs
through a compliance team. Thanks.
Because compliance, ethics,
that's your thing, Liza?
- Should be all of our thing, Brent.
- [Brent] Yeah, it should.
By the way, I got this weird package
from a Randy Drake, your ex-husband.
He wanted to correct a few things
on the bio from your site.
You actually didn't go to college,
or finish high school,
and before joining our team,
you got naked for money.
- Fucking give me that.
- Hold on now! Hold on.
I'm guessing that's how you two met.
And as far as your
illuminated career in pharma...
that you made up.
Unless you count your time
as a drug trafficker,
which got you a felony conviction in 2010.
I sold THC gummies.
Some to people in chronic pain,
which I think actually...
[Brent] And you served three months,
meaning you lied about the jail question
on the application too.
Was that a... envelope slap on my desk?
I just thought you should know the truth.
Truth is you're being disrespectful
to that young lady.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
- I disagree, sir. I... I think...
- [thuds]
[Jack] I didn't ask you
what your opinion was.
Liza Drake helped save this company.
Liza, I'm gonna promote you
to national sales director.
Jesus, thank you so much.
Thank you.

Yes, sir.

[Liza] Right after the IPO,
just as things were looking really good,
the pressures of success
started to get to the boss,
and he got weird.
All right, attention, everyone!
[table tennis ball clattering]
Look down around you.
Look at the floor and see how dirty it is.
You know how much it costs
to polish this floor?
$80,000!
So from now on, at Zanna Therapeutics,
we will be working with our shoes off!
Is it me, or is he losing his shit?
I think he's keeping it
in buckets in his house.
- [Jack] Don't look at me.
- He's a great man, don't be respectful.
[Jack] Do you have ugly toes?
Get a pedicure!
You have ugly feet? Wear socks!
Hey! Get your shoes off!
Get your shoes off!
[Liza] And the whole demented miser thing,
it did not bode well for the plan
to clean up the speaker programs.
Well, I think a compliance department
is a needless expense.
Sir, a huge federal fine
is a needless expense.
- I feel compliance is a bargain.
- [Jack] A bargain?
We built this company because
we weren't afraid to go in for the kill.
Goddamn right.
Sir, look, I just want to say,
when Pete and Liza began this strategy
of paying doctors for prescriptions,
which, by the way, I did not sign off on,
well, that was...
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa!
- [Pete] Open your pocket!
- Fuck!
- Fucking stop. No!
- [Pete] Open this fucking pocket!

Paying doctors for prescriptions...
- [Eric] All right. I can...
- He's got his shoes on!
[Pete] Snake! Get the fuck outta here!
- All right! I'm going!
- Get outta here.
[Eric] I fucked up, okay?
I'm sorry. I apologize!
It was just for me. For my protection.
[Liza] Paley swore
he wasn't ratting to law enforcement.
I love you, Jack!
[Liza] He was just paranoid
that if the shit ever came down

he'd wanna be ready to file a better one.

Four. You see the problem?
Our sales are flat. F-L-A-T. Flat.
You're fucking killing this company.
Sales are flat at $170 million a quarter
'cause we won cancer.
If you don't grow, you die.
Where's the growth?
- In other markets with other medications.
- Lonafen is another medication!
The doctors don't know it
because our messaging is fucked!
Our messaging?
There are millions of people
out there in agony,
suffering from kidney stones,
and fibromyalgia and post-operative pain.
And we're telling our doctors,
you can't treat 'em unless it's cancer?
Why cancer?
The FDA only approved Lonafen
for opioid tolerant cancer patients.
I hear you.
I think Dr. Neel's point... Liza.
- What?
- What Dr. Neel is saying,
and it's an excellent point,
is that pain is pain.
Thank you very much. That's exactly it.
- Pain is pain.
- [inaudible]
So we're gonna get Lonafen approved
for kidney stones? Is...
[upbeat song playing]
You're not fucking saying
that we're going off label.
Can you excuse us
so I can have a conversation with Liza?
Yeah.

That doesn't make sense. What did I do?
Dr. Neel didn't love your,

Oh, fuck him. I was trying to be nice.
Really? Out of the goodness
of your heart you thought,
"That demented billionaire
would love Cracker Jack. I'm gonna do it."
- What's wrong with that? No.
- Everything.
Liza, you weren't helping me
with my bribe money, and I thought...
- Jack would put in a word.
- Oh God.
Did you ask Dr. Neel
for more speaker money?
What is wrong with you?
It's the least he could do.
What's it to him?
No. What's it to me? What's it to me?
I put my neck out to get you this job,
and you embarrass me.
You embarrass yourself.
Really? I fucked the boss
in front of the whole company?
- Don't be nasty.
- I'm not being nasty.
I am the one person, Liza,
the one person in your life
who stuck by you.
When everyone else was all
"Crazy Liza blew it again,"
- I held my tongue.
- Did you?
- I said...
- You thought I was a loser too?
- No.
- And you just lied about it?

Okay, I love you...
I have to go. Someone's here.
[in English] Didn't know you spoke German.
I am German.
- Came over when I was six.
- Wow. How'd I not know that?
Maybe because
you're not all that interested.
What? That's not true.

Just a little stressed, I think.
- Come here.
- No, I'm okay.
Bring it in.
[Dr. Lydell] Mmm.
- Well, I feel better.
- Great.
- Can we go inside?
- Sure.
Wanna tell me what's going on with you?
Um... There's something I need to discuss
with you, between us if that's all right.
Please. Anything.
- [cell phone chimes]
- What is it?
Um...
They're wanting us to...
lean on prescribers
to write Lonafen off-label.
- Ah.
- I had to put it out there,
but I'm happy to say you refused.
Did I say that?
No. But it's...
- Then don't put words in my mouth.
- I'm not...
You know better than me...
that you can't be writing Lonafen
for migraines or whatever.
Where'd you do
your medical training again?
What's going on?
I'm just looking out for you.
By asking me to abandon
my professional judgment
and defer to yours?
- That's not what I'm saying.
- I want a rebate... of 25% gross
on all the off-label scripts I write.
Will that work?
[suspenseful music playing]
Stop it.
[Matt] It's not about pain... fentanyl.
What it does,
it releases
the same neurochemicals a mother feels
the first time she holds her own baby.
I mean, that feeling
is literally why humans exist.
So for me, the off-label thing
came at the perfect time.
[boy exclaims]
[Matt] The doctor just found out
that my cancer was in remission...
which I hadn't told him
so he'd keep the Lonafen flowing.
If anything, the pain's getting worse.
I guess neuropathy from the chemo.
So let's keep you on the Lonafen
if it's working for you.
[Matt] For one thing, it was making
my days on the car lot a lot easier.

So I saved what I could. I got about 235...
$239,000 cash.
Sure, and the size of the loan?
$450,000. So, I was hoping that
I could borrow against my stock options,
which are worth close to $15 million.
Almost certainly more
when they vest in November.
Unfortunately, Miss Drake,
pharma's a very volatile sector,
and from underwriting's perspective,
too much can happen in three months.
I'm really sorry.
[Liza] At that point,
all I could think to do
is get on my hands and knees
to the one person who A, had the cash,
and B, might like
a nice fat favor to lord over me.
But then everything changed.
And the crazy thing is,
none of us saw it coming.
Not us, and sure as shit not our doctors.

- No.

You have to wait for Dr. Lydell.
Step away from the car, please.
Step away!
[tires screeching]
- It's not good.
- [Liza] It's a calamity.
- A disaster...
- [Pete] Losing Lydell will
pinch quarter three. No way around that,
but we can offset the loss in scripts
by refining our dosing message.
- What?
- That's correct.
The model's not sustainable
with low-mic scripts.
- The cheap doses were killing us.
- Correct.
I think we go with titration next.
Higher doses, higher commissions.
What about Lydell's patients?
- We'll have to find them.
- That's what I'm talking about.
Where they're going to.
Get those doctors on our program...
I mean the dead ones.
[Pete] It's not our fault.
No. From our lawyers,
our patients are on such a high baseline
of other schedule II's,
we can't be solely implicated in this.
- [phone ringing]
- I got to take this.
Who's that?
- Didn't I say no phones?
- We huddle tomorrow.
Go over the messaging for the conference.
Something fun. Something light.
Right?
Yeah?
[Liza] I figure we maybe had 24 hours
before the company went down.
So I thought, what the hell?
You all right?
- I need to talk to you about something.
- What's up?
- My daughter, remember Phoebe?
- Of course.
She's not doing good.
- And, um, she needs surgery.
- Oh.
And insurance won't cover it.
And I put aside as much as I could,
but I need another 450 to pay for it.
I'm not asking for a gift.
I was just thinking
I could sell you my stock options.
Before you vest?
What, you're not thinking of leaving us,
are you, Liza?
- No.
- [Jack] Mmm.
Her surgery's next month though,
and I don't vest till November.
- So, it's a problem.
- [Jack] Yeah. I see the problem.
But here's the thing.
When my wife was dying,
I was so benumbed with shock and grief
that I didn't realize that her illness
brought with it a secret gift,
a new sense of time, a creative fire.
Use your crisis as your fire.
You'd be amazed at what you're capable of.
Well, you can start
by running down those patients.
Crisis.
Fire.
Come on now.
Phoebe needs you.
[Liza] Hi.
Hi, baby.
Mom.
It's okay. It's okay.
[girl crying]
It's all right, baby. It's okay.
Just go to your sister, okay?
Just wanted to bring you back your...
Oh God. [crying]
I'm so sorry, Camille.
[melancholy music playing]
You didn't do anything.
It's not your fault.
You're not a bad person.
[Liza] I will not give up on myself.
I will not give up on my dreams.
I will make my life count.
I will make my life count.
- You should have a lawyer present.
- [Liza] That's fine.
I want you to know...
that I helped build... our speaker program.
Our bribery program.
Tried to bring it into compliance.
Who else signed off on these programs?
Eric Paley.
Pete Brenner.
Jack Neel.
Oh, it all came down from Jack.
I'll testify to that.
[sighs] We need more than your testimony...
because this is how this will go.
Neel will hire these incredible lawyers
who'll tell this sad story to the jury
about a sweet old man
who got taken in by a master crook
named Liza Drake.
No, I came in as a low-level rep.
He's a fucking billionaire with a PhD.
Fair point. But if you don't want to eat
your boss's share on this,
we need proof
tying Neel to the bribery scheme.
What kind of proof?
Documents. Voice recordings.
You don't get it.
He never touches the day-to-day and he's...
he hasn't been in the office
since the IPO.
You can't get near him with a phone.
He has this guy,
he has a guy with a wand thing...
Texts, emails.
Bring us something proving
Neel's involvement, we can deal.
He has a flip phone, he doesn't email.
The way it works is you... I...
We would email... the CEO...
- [Jane] Brenner.
- Yeah.
And then Brenner prints a hard copy,
and then Jack marks it up and...
Brenner gives us the gist of it
and eats the original. I don't know.
Can you bring us some of those printouts?
And we'll tell the judge no jail time.
[Liza] Dr. Jack was right about one thing.
There's nothing so inspiring
as sheer desperation.
I wrote an e-mail to Pete
saying I tracked down Lydell's patients
to 18 different doctors
and that I needed a quarter mil right away
to get 'em into the program.
I said they wanted golf memberships,
college tuition bills,
all sorts of things
for Jack to have opinions about.
And Dr. Jack, bless his heart,
he put his stink all over the document.
And Brenner, per my instructions,
he brought it to our sales meeting,
which was going down that night.
Okay, so this Patton guy.
Low decile.
Jack says no way to this college bill
until he proves himself.
Nice tights.
Everything okay?
Yeah.

Why would you do that, Liza? God damn it!
Remember where you were
when I scooped you outta there?
- I know.
- When I gave you a shot?
I gave you a fucking life,
and you do this to me?
Pete, we killed people.
Oh, bullshit!
We did this, and now you're out there
and you're, like, bonusing higher doses.
- We don't write the scripts!
- People are dead because of us!
Do you not get that? Do you just not care?
What's wrong with you?
You care? Funny how it took
your whale getting busted
for you to sprout a conscience!
- Fuck you, dude.
- What'd they give you?
Must've been good to get a greedy fuck
like you to rat before you cashed out.
- Oh, you don't know me.
- I am you, Liza!
We're just selfish pieces of shit.
Only with you, there's no limit.
No, I'm nothing like you.
I hope you fucking die.
[Jack] Pete, we're gonna contain this.
You just need to stick to a certain truth.
What does that mean?
[man] You're implicated, Pete.
There's no way around that.
Dr. Neel's gonna handle
your legal expenses. Look...
We're gonna get you
the most advantageous plea deal...
And meet my kid
for the first time behind plexiglass?
No. No fucking way.
I'm not doing that. No.
[man] Prison's not on the table,
but your assets, your house, your savings,
that's probably all going away.
Pete. Pete, I love you like a son.
I'm gonna take care of you.
I'll ensure that you and your family
will be comfortable
for the rest of your lives.
- Your house, your cars...
- [dog whining]
...college for your child.
You need to trust me.
[sighs]
If I testify that you knew nothing.
[Jack] It's the best thing for everyone.
- [banging on door]
- [officer] Police! Open the door, sir!
Pete? Pete...
[baby fussing]
[banging continues]
[Liza] They even caught up
with Eric Paley down in Argentina.
- [man] You ready to talk?
- Yeah.
Dr. Neel had no knowledge
of the conspiracy.
[Liza] But not before Neel's lawyer did.
[nurse] Miss Drake?
Your daughter's in recovery.
Is she doing okay?
She is. She did really well.
Baby.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
[sighs]
[Liza] And while everyone else
was going down,
Neel stuck to his bullshit,
and no one could prove he was lying.
{\an8}He was on the cover of Forbes.
When they asked him about the charges
on everyone who'd touched the company...
My involvement?
I was an investor.
I had no knowledge
of the daily operations.
I was a passive investor.
[Jackie] Please forgive me.
[Liza] I'm so sorry too.
- [Jackie] Oh.
- [Liza] I'm so happy to see you.
[indistinct conversation]
- Hi, Meemaw.
- [Jackie] Oh, hi, sweet girl.
How you doing?
[Phoebe] I'm okay. I'm just dandy.
Mom, when you were shaking down Jack Neel
for more speaker money...
- We seriously relitigating this?
- No, no, no.
When you reached out to him,
did you call him?
He wouldn't give me his number.
Just his email.
Did you email him... directly?
How many times?
A few.
Did you save 'em?
[Jackie]
"Should be aware that, for example,
Tina Murphy got $8,000 in speaker money
for Dr. Jacob, and I got 900 bucks."
[Liza] Okay, okay. Go on. Keep...
[Jackie] "$22,000,
Andrea Welch, who's such a crappy rep,
she needs all the bribe money that she..."
Did he respond?
Uh... Scroll.
[suspenseful music playing]
Mom... Oh my God.
Thank God you're so fucking slutty!

[Liza] The headlines following
Dr. Jack's arrest were less than pretty.
They talked about Adrienne Jenkins,
daughter,
22-year-old Lonafen patient found dead,
toxic levels of fentanyl in her blood.
Emma Kowalski, mother.
Sam Walter, husband.
[interviewer] Wait, can I stop you there?
[Liza] Sure, what?
[interviewer] You yourself said
the overdose risk was less than 1%...
According to the study.
- The study?
- The Hartigan study out of Mass General.
Elliot Hartigan.
I authored the Lonafen study.
[interviewer] The study was false?
The study was accurate.
Out of a test group of 200 patients
under clinical observation for two years,
there was only one
confirmed fentanyl overdose.
What they left out
was that the drug was administered
to opioid tolerant patients
by responsible doctors
who weren't being paid
to crank the doses and addict people.
Not only that,
the clinical subjects
were stage 4 cancer patients.
So before abuse became an issue,
most of them were dead.
For non-terminal patients,
they concluded
that the risk of overdose and addiction
were all incredibly high... because, um...
well, pardon me, but no shit,
it's fentanyl.
Yeah, I... I trusted the study.
[interviewer] The cancer pain study.
And then you bribed doctors
to prescribe Lonafen for headaches.
Yeah.
In addition to fines and restitution,
Dr. Lydell,
I sentence you to a period of 40 months.

We wrote this statement...
where I was gonna say
how naive I was coming into this.
That how when I told my bosses...
that things didn't seem right...
they said we're playing by the rules,
and that I believed them,
and I went along with it.
I was supposed to say
I didn't go to pharmacy school.
It wasn't me writing the prescriptions,
it wasn't my fault.
But that would be a lie.
I helped build this thing.
And I knew it was wrong.
The truth is, I wanted the money.
I wanted the respect.
And I wanted it so badly,
I stopped caring how I got it.
And now people's lives
have been destroyed.
Am I sorry?
Yes.
But I did what I did.
On behalf of the government,
I just want to restate the enormity
of what this case has accomplished.
For the first time,
top pharmaceutical executives
are going to prison
for their roles in the opioid crisis,
and we couldn't have done it
without the cooperation of Liza Drake.
Therefore, we recommend no imprisonment
to send an important message
to people in her position
to stand up and do the right thing.
[judge] I appreciate
the government's recommendation
and Miss Drake's contrition,
which I do believe to be genuine.
But your greed cost lives.
You can't erase it with cooperation.
This gives me no pleasure whatsoever,
but you are going to prison, Miss Drake.
Please stand.
I sentence you
to a period of incarceration
of one year and three months.
[camera shutters clicking]
[Pete] Yeah. A lot of shame.
There's lot of guilt.
Lot of stuff
you can only work out with, you know, God.
But a thing
can be two things at the same time.
You know?
There's a lot of people that I could name
that have gone through their entire lives
without ever doing
a fucking thing for anybody.
Yes... we hurt people.
Yes... we destroyed lives.
But we also brought people,
suffering people,
the best medication
for cancer breakthrough pain
the world has ever seen.
[interviewer] Really?
You still believe that?
You sell what's in your bag.
[Liza] I feel if you went for
the eye invigorator
and the pore refiner,
that would be a good combo for you.
- [woman] Let me try it?
- A little on your hand?
- Yes, please.
- Feel how smooth that is?
Yes. Dab it?
Put it up there, and it'll light you up.
It's all natural, all made by hand,
all by my mother,
and she's right over there in blue.
She's 68 years old. Can you believe that?
- This stuff works. It works!
- [woman] I wouldn't believe it.
Oh, he probably fathered half the kids
in Tampa, but wow, could he sing.
You were married four times?
That one was annulled.
That's kinda hot.
Oh, Ryan, no.
To me, it smell like a dead body.
But let me show you something.
- This...
- Hey, Nicole?
- I'm gonna go grab some lunch.
- Okay.
- [Liza] You hold it down?
- All right!
Feel this.
[Liza] The old life, I don't think about.
Only sometimes...
when I'm trying to fall asleep at night.
I'm gonna get a shot of Cuervo.
- Got it.
- Thanks.
I have those dreams
that aren't really dreams,
where I'm running the company,
I've pulled us back from the crooked shit,
and people look at me like I'm somebody.
And it feels so good that it scares me.
So I sit up, and I turn on the light.

{\an8}The founder of the pharmaceutical company

{\an8}Well, John Kapoor,
the founder of this company,
{\an8}will be going to prison
for five and a half years,
{\an8}and it's a sentence prosecutors hope
{\an8}sends a strong message
to the pharmaceutical industry.
{\an8}Out of pure greed,

{\an8}bribed doctors to prescribe
this powerful, addictive drug
