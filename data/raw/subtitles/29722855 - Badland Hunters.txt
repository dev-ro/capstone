{\an8}So-yeon.
{\an8}Right.
{\an8}So-yeon.
{\an8}So-yeon.
{\an8}I'm gonna try again.
{\an8}I swear you're gonna live, okay?
Gi-su!
Yang Gi-su!
Stop right now.
Just let So-yeon go.
I have to revive her.
She'll be dead if we don't act now.
- Don't make me shoot.
- Gi-su, wait.
You've taken over a hundred lives
with these horrific experiments.
This isn't what So-yeon would have wanted.
Your daughter's not going to come back.
Let her go.
I can't.
I've finally got it figured it out now.
I swear, I know. Look at me.
I already injected myself with it.
I'm living proof.
Now we can save So-yeon.
Yang Gi-su!
No, you can't.
Don't touch her!
Get him out of here.
You're gonna kill her!
You're gonna kill So-yeon!
Huh?
EMERGENCY ALERT POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE
ABOVE 5.0 ON THE RICHTER SCALE DETECTED
Oh no...
So-yeon.
No!
BADLAND HUNTERS
Yes! Yes.
Die, die, die, die. Come on, die.
Oh shit!
Oh God, it's gonna fucking kill me.
Oh God! I need help! I need help!
Get back!
Get back!
Hey, come here.
Hey, I was about to finish that off, man.
Who cares who kills it?
Come on, let's get this out of here.
I'm hungry now.
Oh my.
Huh?
Grandma, I told you to let me know
if you needed me to do anything.
I'm fine, Su-na.
I just stepped outside
to get a little fresh air.
Come on,
you know your knees need rest.
Why don't you go take a seat over there?
Hmph.
I can't even remember
the last time that it rained here.
Oh God.
There really isn't any drinkable water,
is there?
Maybe we should... find ourselves a car
and go live in the Bus District.
What do you think, Su-na?
Well, um,
I think I'd rather live
right here with you.
Just because there are more people there
doesn't mean it's safer.
There was that time
the cannibals tried taking us.
They used to be kind before the drought,
and now it's just different.
You know, not everybody in the world
is evil like that.
Well, most people
that I've seen are like that though.
Su-na.
Listen, this is what I think, okay?
In this life, it's best to believe
that you reap whatever you sow.
It might seem like everyone's evil,
but if you embrace the good in the world,
you're going to find people that are kind.
That, I'm sure of.
Grandma, you trust too much.
I'm sure before the earthquake
that was true.
I guess you're right.
But I don't remember what that was like.
Oh, that's right.
We're going to
the Bus District today, actually.
- Nam San must be back from his hunt.
- Mm-hmm.
I've had enough
of all this dirty water.
We haven't gotten a drop of rain
for how many months now?
This is nothing.
Last year, we had a drought
for over six months.
Hey! Hey!
We've got meat here!
Hurry up!
Alright, alright, line up everyone,
right here!
Have your bartering pieces ready to go.
Hey, sir!
It's... it's a single-file line.
Alright.
Rubber boots.
- Nam San.
- Fine, whatever.
Next.
Oh, no, no.
- No, thanks.
- Looks fine to me.
Alright. Here.
Ah! My God!
This should be enough
to get that section.
The entire tail.
The whole thing.
Yeah, but you can't eat that. No, thanks.
Once this situation dies down and things
start to get better, this will all be...
Oh wow.
You're really optimistic, lady. Hmm?
I mean, it's been over three years
since the whole world ended.
It's about time you accept it.
Hey, here, at least take this.
Here you go. Here.
We really shouldn't be doing this,
but no one's looking.
Do I cook it?
It's poisonous. You better.
What's this?
- Rice.
- Rice?
Oh, thank you.
- Hey there.
- Su-na!
- Hello, how are you?
- Oh, there you are, Su-na. How's it going?
Hello.
Ah, man, you didn't have to come
all the way out here.
I could have just stopped by
on my way home.
- She must be exhausted.
- Oh, cut it out. We need to eat, don't we?
Anyway, Su-na owes her life
to Nam San, after all.
I can't believe that was three years ago.
I feel bad. You've given us
your hospitality for so long. Here.
You didn't have to. Thank you so much.
Su-na has grown into a fine young woman.
Ah, thanks a lot.
Right. Well, uh, take some meat.
- This here.
- Su-na.
I caught this crocodile, you know.
Mm-hmm? Nam San didn't catch this one?
Hey, seriously? Huh?
I wanted to trade this in.
Oh, I'm guessing
you painted this. Let's see it.
Wow...
Masterpiece. It's amazing.
- An original?
- Yes.
Have one for me?
I'm out there hunting too, right?
Oh, we should head out now.
There are people behind us waiting.
- Mm.
- Sorry about that.
- We'll get going now.
- Goodbye. See you soon.
- We'll be on our way now.
- See ya.
Next.
They practically set up
a fucking village here, huh?
Living hard, I see. Damn!
Alright, listen.
Bus District folks, listen up.
All of us are from the, uh,
the Jamsil Police Station, okay?
Huh? Here's the proof right here.
Take a look.
Uh, so long as you guys cooperate with us,
nobody will get hurt.
Okay?
Fuck me, just say something.
Uh, well, as to why we're here, then,
uh, here it is. Here we go.
We are bounty hunters
searching for a notorious villain.
We've been on his trail and...
WANTED
...found that this neighborhood
reeks of his scent.
So I'd like to ask everybody
for your cooperation right now. Huh?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Yeah. That guy looks just like him.
- See that?
- Oh, he does!
Alright, take him away.
Oh God!
It's not me!
Hey, hey, hey, grab that woman
who's wearing all the gold.
Hey!
I'm a lady though. Wait.
Yeah, I know. Uh, this guy is a lady.
He's a lady?
Oh!
Hey, hey, you, you, you.
Let's go.
Hey, let me go.
Strong guy, eh?
You fuck.
Are you even a real cop?
Oh jeez...
We warned you.
Cooperate, or you'll get hurt.
Whoa!
Wow!
How old are you?
What's it matter to you?
I'm just glad to see you.
Everybody your age has
basically disappeared, that's all.
You smell awful. Stay away.
- Come on, Grandma.
- Let's go, let's go.
Ah, this bitch. Come here!
- That son of a...
- What did you say?
Hey, you, get off her...
- You old hag!
- You son of a bitch!
Su-na, are you alright?
Hey, come here,
you little bastard!
Hey, hold it.
Go.
Move.
The hell do you think you're doing?
Come on! Come on!
Die!
Hey, that hurt.
So are you in charge, then?
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't even know who the boss is.
Come on. Just say who it is.
Uh, T... T... T...
Tiger. Tiger's my boss.
Tiger? So he's still alive, huh?
Hey, where'd you get this water?
- A... at an apartment. An apartment.
- An apartment?
- Yes, sir.
- I've spent a lot of time around here.
Never come across any apartments.
It's the truth.
I... it's just far from here
and surrounded by tall trees,
so it can just be hard to see, yeah.
There's clean water at that apartment.
Listen, if you come here again,
I'm going to have to kill you, okay?
Yes, yes, of course.
And Tiger should know that.
Yes.
Okay, what should...
wh... who should I say said that?
Nam San.
Oh, you're... you're Nam San. Oh...
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Understood. Hey, hey. Go, get up, go.
So sorry, I'm sorry.
Go! Get the fuck... Go, go, go!
Drive, drive!
You alright?
You alright? You okay?
Oh, yes, yes. Are you?
I think so.
Cutie pie...
Nam San.
By the way, all that talk earlier
might not have been complete nonsense.
What talk?
Remember? They said there's an apartment
where you can get clean water.
I heard it really exists.
And people are dying to get over there.
I heard there's a ton of residents,
and that it's heaven on earth.
How about you go check it out?
I mean, I'm just curious about it.
And besides,
you don't get to just go there.
The "chosen few" are
the only ones allowed in.
Huh? Who are these jerks?
- Su-na!
- Hey.
Who are you all?
Oh, it's fine. It's fine.
They're not bad people.
Uh, she says she's a teacher.
It's okay, Nam San.
What kind of teacher?
Hello, gentlemen. Nice to meet you.
We actually have started
a safe haven in Seoul.
I'm the leader of our organization's
volunteer group, and...
I think that's the same place
I mentioned before.
But, uh, why us though?
Uh, you see,
we're prioritizing the safety
of families with children below 20.
We believe that protecting our youth
is the only way to save humanity.
Su-na, if you come with us,
your grandmother will live comfortably
for the rest of her life.
We have clean water
and plenty of food in storage.
You have clean water?
Oh my God, that's incredible.
If that place is so amazing,
then it's gonna be a target for the gangs.
You ever stop to consider that?
There's a security force
of armed ex-military soldiers,
which means that the gangs
couldn't possibly make a move on us.
Well, in that case,
can the two of them come with us?
They're like family to me.
I'm sorry.
We can only take
direct family members right now.
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
but I need your answer soon.
For Su-na's sake,
I hope that you're going to make
the right choice here.
And unfortunately, we're going to have to
find someone else if you say no.
The thing is, ma'am,
my grandmother is not well,
and she won't be able to walk
that whole way.
We have medical staff
standing by at the halfway point
to ensure everyone on our watch
arrives safely. Don't worry.
She's right. Su-na, we should go.
You should go.
It has to be better than this.
Right. You deserve that.
I'll come visit you.
Okay.
You too, Nam San.
Will you also visit us?
I will, I promise.
Just a second, Grandma.
Thank you so much
for all your help and support, Nam San.
Don't mention it. Take care of yourself.
Safe travels.
It's, uh, just a practice sketch.
Oh wow!
We should hurry along now.
It'll be harder to walk after sundown.
- Oh, um, Grandma, come on.
- Okay.
When'd she get a good-enough look
to draw me like this?
Hyung, Su-na has a crush on me,
don't you think?
Hmm, nah, I don't think so.
Man, what am I gonna do
now that Su-na's gone?
This place is way too dangerous
for her to live in.
Things like what happened today
happen too often.
I mean, you could just keep her safe,
like how you did today.
How would I do that?
I couldn't even protect my own daughter.
Sheesh, man!
Look, there you go again
with that kind of talk.
But Su-na sure does look
a lot like your daughter.
Oh!
If you got married and adopted me,
wouldn't that mean
we could also live there?
Huh?
What do you think about the jewelry girl?
- Hey.
- Seriously.
I know the world might have ended,
but I still have standards.
You just want me to be alone forever.
You know how couples
take after each other?
You're pretty similar. And that complexion
would look great with the right makeup.
Hey, she stuffed that snake in her nose.
Who does that?
That's enough.
Okay? Enough.
Where you going?
Ugh, you're running your mouth too much,
so I'm getting some air.
Going on a night hunt?
- That's right.
- Let me come with you.
Grandma, are you alright?
Uh-huh.
- Yes, dear, don't you worry about me.
- Watch your step here.
Oh, don't worry.
They're part of our volunteer group.
Okay.
These are
the Western Region families joining us.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for making it
all the way out here, everyone.
It's a pleasure.
Now follow me this way,
please, and be careful.
Um...
I'm Lee Ju-ye.
I'm 18. And you?
Uh, Han Su-na.
And I'm also 18.
Oh. Wanna be friends?
Yeah, sure.
We're friends now.
I haven't had a friend
who's my age in forever.
Yeah, me too.
There was nobody my age
in my neighborhood either.
And where were you living?
I lived in a tent near the Bus District.
I've been staying with my grandma here.
Oh.
Nice to meet you, Ju-ye.
My mom and dad made us live underground
'cause it wasn't safe outside.
I'm sure that was hard.
It wasn't so bad, actually.
But the bugs and rats
would crawl all over my body.
So I had to keep moving
my arms and legs, you know,
so they didn't bite down,
thinking I was dead.
That part was pretty rough.
At least that stuff is all over now.
Mm-hmm.
I heard the place is amazing.
First thing I'm gonna do
when we get there is take a shower.
It still feels like the bugs are
clinging to my skin right now.
I wonder
if Su-na's made it there by now.
God, I wish I could go there with her.
Man, I really don't wanna
have to let her go.
You know we can go see her
when we visit, right?
No.
The jewelry woman.
I always wanted that kind of mother.
- Alright, you little... Come here!
- Hey, okay, I get it!
Careful.
Oh God! Oh my...
Oh my God! Grandma, are you okay?
Oh God.
Let's stop here, okay?
Why don't we escort Su-na's grandmother
and your grandfather
to the medical station
I mentioned earlier on?
It's dangerous terrain
from this point forward,
and we wouldn't want anyone to get hurt.
Mr. Oh and Mr. Choi
will safely escort you there.
Thank you so much.
Yes, thank you
for everything you're doing.
Ma'am,
just please take care of my grandma, okay?
Of course. We'll take care of her.
- Mr. Choi.
- I'll look after your grandma.
- Please come with me, sir.
- Thank you so much.
- Slowly.
- I-I'll see you tomorrow, Dad.
- Careful, sweetheart.
- I hope he'll be alright.
Alright,
let's move on now, then.
Su-na, you just keep going. It'll be okay.
- Oh sh... shit. Shit.
- Freaking out again.
Looks like a bust.
Let's check the snare.
Okay.
These vehicles belong to us.
Everyone get in,
and we'll get off our feet
for the rest of the way.
Excuse me.
If the cars were here, then Grandma
could have just come with all of us.
Okay, we'll wait, then.
What's a few more hours of waiting
when everyone's been walking all night?
Isn't that right, everyone?
- Ma.
- Huh?
- I'm thirsty.
- We don't have any water right now.
Hang in there, okay?
Oh, what do we do?
Su-na,
we'll send a car
for your grandmother tomorrow.
Don't worry about her.
Let's get going now.
Get in, everyone.
- Oh God, thank you.
- Oh my, you must be exhausted.
Don't worry about your grandma too much.
I'm sure she's okay.
- Mm.
- We need to do a head count.
To think there's still people doing
such fine work in these trying times...
Yes, he's right.
I feel bad you're going out of your way.
Oh, don't mention it.
Alright, it's time to stop now.
I don't see the facility anywhere though.
Down there.
Huh?
Is that Grandma?
Grandma!
Grandma! Wake up, Grandma!
What's with these freaks?
What the hell?
Let's go, you asshole.
Why did you kill her?
- They were both useless.
- You fucking son of a bitch!
Oh my God...
Su-na...
Where is Su-na?!
Fucking die!
Ji-wan!
Who are you?
Hyung, we have to go right now.
Su-na's in danger.
Not yet. We have to pay our respects.
Are you just gonna leave her like that?
We're almost there, everyone.
Please gather your personal items.
You came here to see me?
That's right.
I need your help, Nam San.
I need to rescue my associates
and the residents of the apartment.
All right, so my question is, why'd
you come to us, of all people, for help?
And who the hell were those guys?
And the apartment?
Hey. Mind your business.
I really need you.
I've never seen
anything like this before.
You need to chop their heads off?
Exactly.
What are they anyway?
My name is Lee Eun-ho.
I used to be
an air force sergeant, special ops.
We're going down to look for survivors.
Yes, Sergeant.
We were watching everything
from the sky
on the day of the great earthquake.
During our search for survivors,
we came across an apartment
that somehow hadn't crumbled down.
So our unit struck an aquifer there,
and with the survivors,
we did everything in our power
to get the apartment up and running.
But then one day,
that man came to us.
Yang Gi-su.
The only doctor we'd seen
since the tragedy.
Being a doctor,
he was invaluable to our cause.
But one day, he showed his true colors.
Dr. Yang, I wanted to check on something.
Some parents have been complaining
that their children have yet to return
ever since they came to see you.
What have you done?
Lee Eun-ho, what's going on?
Well, explain yourself.
Sergeant Kwon,
don't you think it's time
we let Sergeant Eun-ho in on our secret?
Eun-ho,
the world as we know it is doomed.
We need to...
place all our faith in Dr. Yang.
I merely gave him some advice.
I also gave him a little gift as well.
- Why did you kill him?
- Look.
This is the breakthrough
we were waiting for.
Sergeant Lee Eun-ho?
Think about it.
Take a good look at me.
How...
how do you think I was able to survive
that horrible earthquake?
I once went two, three months or so
without having any water.
This is the future of mankind.
This apartment won't last long,
and everyone's doomed.
Failure to embrace this change
will kill everyone.
And I'll help you all survive.
No, you're insane.
- Where are the children?
- Get her out.
- What have you done with them?
- Now, now.
Wait! Let me go!
Shit!
Lee Eun-ho!
It seems Yang Gi-su has been conducting
strange experiments on humans.
They've become those creatures
because of what he's doing.
- If you help me, then...
- Hey.
Listen.
Su-na is all I care about.
And I'm gonna kill you
if you even try anything.
Got it?
We have over 30 families
living here right now,
and we even provide our residents
with electricity,
thanks to the new solar panels
that we installed.
Are we going to live here?
Is that lettuce? I even see some tomatoes.
WELCOME, NEW RESIDENTS
WELCOME TO THE NEW FUTURE OF HUMANITY
Make way, make way!
Dr. Yang is about to come out now.
Hello, everyone.
I'm in charge of this place.
Yang Gi-su, nice to meet you.
Welcome, everyone.
You all must have
gone through terrible things out there,
where the world is brutal and unsafe.
You've all had to endure
the worst out there,
where the barbarians roam free.
But now... now you don't have to worry.
We will be, uh, providing you
with clean water
and provisions, of course.
And we'll keep you all safe
from the outside world.
Right, get some water for them
if you would.
That's clean water
that we purified ourselves
in this apartment.
Yeah.
Uh, wait, sir.
My grandma is gonna be arriving soon.
Can I please have another water?
Thanks so much.
They've been mercilessly taking children,
just like they took Su-na.
Can you imagine
what he must be doing to them?
Those sons of bitches! Oh shit!
We have to go right now.
- Su-na's in danger!
- Do you have a death wish or something?
Charging in won't do us any good.
Security is much tighter
than you might expect.
They've been shooting
everybody who trespasses.
I'll kick things off by taking care
of all the guards at the main gate
and keeping them distracted come daybreak.
If the two of you
get to the underground prison
and rescue my associates,
they'll be able to help us.
Hey, why should we believe
your associates or whatever?
Ugh, so disrespectful,
running your mouth again.
How old are you?
I'm 18, fuck you very much, lady.
You better watch your mouth.
- Let go!
- Hey, calm down, you little lovebirds.
Let's think this over.
Amen, yeah.
Hey, hey!
Sir, I took care of all of them.
- Go at it, you stupid idiot!
- Fight!
- Hurry up and fight!
- Hey, hey!
- Come on!
- Hey.
Get 'em out of there!
Come on, bro. Wanna see
your wife's blood spurt everywhere?
Do something!
Let's go, let's go!
Oh shit!
- Bitch!
- Shit, man, we lost again?!
Hey, Pung-gi.
Have anything left to bet?
You limp-dick,
chrome-dome, lard-ass shithead,
can't you see there's one left?
Wow, to think in prison, I saved your life
just so you could disrespect me.
- You show some respect.
- Fuck them up!
Come here!
Fuck!
Tiger!
What, asshole?
Damn it!
Hey, fucking kill them all!
Alright, wait!
Tiger around here?
Well, look who it is.
Nam San, it's been a while.
Oh, there's the potato face I remember.
Sir, that's the asshole.
Watch out. He's a beast.
Thanks to you,
my boxing career ended, and I got screwed.
I've been itching for revenge,
and you just walked right into your grave.
Hey, I came here to ask you a question.
I changed my mind after that tone.
- Should I beat your ass now?
- There's no ring around here.
Street fighting's way out of your league,
you ass!
Hey, Pung-gi.
If you bring down that gorilla,
I'll give you half the slaves.
Half?
After I kill him,
you're next, you fat loser.
Now kill that man!
Shit, man...
Stop, stop!
Damn it! Ugh, it hurts!
- Oh God, it hurts!
- Get up. Come on.
Hey, let's go!
Wait!
Come on!
Oh... oh God, it hurts so much, oh...
Hello, how are you?
Uh, can you tell me
when my grandma will be arriving?
Your grandma?
What do you mean?
We sent a car for them earlier today,
so she should be here at dinner.
Don't worry about it. Enjoy the sunshine.
Okay.
You sure are doing a lot
to please a child.
Children are the pathway to our future.
We have to keep them content.
Our real future is through Dr. Yang Gi-su.
Okay?
Today we're going to be announcing
the cumulative scores.
In first,
Kim Hak-yong.
Unit 604. Lee Gyu-yeon, unit 607.
Third place, Choi Ju-yeong, unit 601.
Fourth place, Jang Chang-su, unit 608.
Uh, ex... excuse me?
What grades is he talking about?
We're new here, so we don't know.
Whichever student gets the highest score,
they get to choose a unit
to live in with their family.
I'm so jealous of you.
My child places last every week.
Family members of the student
with the highest score
will be exempt from work
and also given a free meal pass.
Family members of Kim Hak-yong,
please step forward.
- Congratulations. Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Doctor.
Do you think
that you can score the highest?
Of course!
The children are our hope!
The children are our future!
Everyone, please keep
your children strong,
and let's lift them all up!
Alright, everybody.
It's time to say your goodbyes.
As we mentioned before, all the students
will be living on the eighth floor.
- Huh?
- What?
You never mentioned that though.
Your grandmother has been told
all of this.
Maybe she forgot to say something to you?
Oh...
Does that mean that I won't live with her?
Will we have
any contact with Ju-ye at all?
I'll make sure you'll be able to see her
if you just schedule a meeting.
So we just need to make
an appointment with you?
Of course.
I'll get going now.
I'll score high for you.
Don't skip any meals, okay?
Okay, let's go.
- Please take good care of her.
- Right, take good care of her.
- See you later!
- As for the parents, please follow me.
- Gyu-rin, listen to your older brother.
- Okay.
- Han Seong-won, take good care of Gyu-rin.
- I will.
- Okay? Bye.
- This way.
Is this all I need to take?
This is the clean water
that our children drink.
Now, if you look here,
you'll see the steps we take
to filter the dirty water
and produce the potable water we drink.
The most precious resource we have.
Hyung!
They have guns here.
Okay.
Hey, I'm just curious.
Where'd you get the guns and the water?
The apartment, is that right, guys?
Huh?
You don't know?
Uh, do... do we...
do... do we know where we got it?
What?
Do you know or not?
Uh, I'm not... I'm not entirely sure.
Okay, take a nap, then.
Do you know?
I don't exactly...
Lights out.
You? You don't know?
No.
What about you?
- Uh...
- You don't know.
What about you? Do you know? No?
You don't, do you?
- Uh, you don't know about this.
- I do know, sir.
- Nope, no way.
- I go out to make these deals.
You're gonna need me around
to help you, Nam San.
Hey there.
Do you come down here every day to work?
Yeah, this is our daily work.
They have a monopoly on all the water.
We're talking really clean shit.
They just hoard it for themselves?
That gives them their authority.
They've been living comfortably
while all the gangs, ours included,
bring them anything in exchange for water.
What do you give to them in return?
People.
In the beginning, they were okay
with us bringing in whoever,
but nowadays, they've just
been asking for children.
- Teenagers.
- Why children?
I don't know about that.
You didn't know what was happening
and sold them people?
- Whoa, chill!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Relax, relax.
Then in the Bus District,
when your boys tried to nab Su-na,
it was... that was for this?
- Yeah.
- Oh, you son of a bitch!
Hey, come on, come on.
How come you kids have such short tempers?
- Hey, come on.
- Let me go.
Relax, let it go.
We had to make a living somehow.
Okay, so how did you
get past their snipers, then?
You can get in on...
...delivery days.
- They make sure deliveries go through.
- On delivery days.
You must be tired from all that talking.
Get some rest.
Well, I feel like I'm okay, actually.
Just catch some Zs.
Mr. Choi has taken care
of the children's grandparents.
Uh, our newest children are
Han Su-na and Lee Ju-ye,
both 18-year-old girls.
Uh, accounting for our two new recruits,
that puts us at 19 total,
plus they're much healthier
than we had expected.
I see.
- Take good care of those two, then.
- Okay.
And make sure enough time has passed
since they've had clean water.
- You know what to do.
- I'll make the preparations right away.
I'll visit them later this afternoon.
Alright, get to it.
- You've got a little something there.
- Let's go.
Hello, everyone.
Here, this way.
Stand here.
Attention, and bow.
Nice to meet you.
Alright, everybody.
We have some new friends today.
Ju-ye, go ahead and introduce yourself.
Oh, okay. Uh...
Hello, everyone!
It's so nice to meet you.
I'm Ju-ye, and I'm 18.
I like eating,
and I really don't like bugs.
Uh, thank you so much!
Let's give her a hand.
It's so nice to have you. And you, Su-na?
Su-na?
No need to be nervous.
You can just say hi.
Hi, I'm... Han Su-na.
I like drawing, um,
and I don't like...
living with others.
Alright! Welcome!
There. You can sit over there
at those empty desks.
- Okay.
- There you go.
Hello!
Alright. Today, we'll learn why
we need to change our metabolism.
Open your books, everyone.
Let's first talk about
the anatomy of humans as things stand.
Because we currently need to drink water
and consume food
in order to survive,
we've wasted precious resources on people
that do not serve the greater cause.
To be frank, we are weak,
and in our current world,
which is plagued by a shortage of water,
mankind needs to take
a new, stronger physical form.
We must develop a new metabolic system
in order to breed humans that can survive
for extended periods
of dehydration and malnutrition,
thereby reversing the population decline
and paving the way
for civilization to be reborn.
Children,
in this harsh and unforgiving world,
always remind yourselves
of Dr. Yang Gi-su's miracle
and of your own responsibilities.
Our metabolism will improve through
Dr. Yang's research, and eventually,
mankind will finally be given a body
which can adapt to this brave new world.
Pay attention, Su-na.
It's just odd.
Nobody even has enough to drink
on the outside,
yet the people here are able to drink
however much they want and even shower.
Everyone keeps going on and on
about Dr. Yang Gi-su.
Shouldn't he be giving water
to everybody out there who needs it?
Oh, Su-na.
The outside world is full of barbarians.
The exact same type that killed
Yang Gi-su's beloved daughter.
In order to join the new humanity,
you need to be the right kind of person.
What kind...
what kind of person is that?
People that offer aid
in furthering the doctor's research.
I wanna be a part of the research support.
Well, you sound like
you have the right attitude, Ju-ye, no?
Su-na sure could learn a lot from you.
Yes, ma'am.
Now, then, for our next lesson,
we'll be learning about organisms
that are best at surviving in the wild.
We'll be getting a visit
from Dr. Yang Gi-su later,
so let's all welcome him properly
to show our gratitude.
Yes.
These rations are
the fruits of your parents' hard work,
as I'm sure you're all aware.
Let us all dig in with a thankful heart.
And there's the water,
which is more valuable
than anything else in this world.
Make sure to drink it all
down to the very last drop.
Dr. Yang Gi-su had it specially purified
for all of you here.
Ju-ye.
Hello, everyone.
Alright,
a round of applause, everyone.
Attention.
Bow.
"Students are our hope."
I'm sure you're all aware
of our apartment's motto, right?
That's the reason we've been supplying
our students with a special diet.
The world is beset by a shortage
of food and water, as you know.
I'm working day and night
to create a new world
where humans are going to be able
to survive and live a good life
with only a minuscule amount
of food and drinking water.
But until that day comes,
you all need to finish
everything you're given,
making sure not to waste any.
Yes.
Alright.
Doctor, we have someone very promising.
- Oh, there.
- Mm-hmm. She's wonderful.
Her name?
Lee Ju-ye.
Lee Ju-ye, right?
Yes.
Hi. You're 18?
Yeah!
I heard you really wanted to help me
with my research.
Mm.
Why don't we get the ball rolling
with a consultation?
- Yes, of course.
- Uh-huh.
Well, uh, why don't we have you eat first?
Uh, I'll send someone over to meet you
in three hours, huh?
And then we can get started.
Oh wow! Thank you, Doctor.
- Right.
- Let's go.
Dr. Yang.
Where's my grandmother?
Did she get here safe?
Of course she did. Don't you worry.
If my grandmother's here, I wanna see her.
Excuse me.
Did you explain everything to her?
I'm so sorry.
Su-na.
Uh, your grandmother is much worse
than we expected,
so we'll have to keep her in treatment
for the next two to three days.
Grandma got that sick on the way here?
She just needs to rest, okay?
You're going to be able
to see her in a day or so.
Dr. Yang Gi-su himself is
personally seeing to her treatment...
Yes, of course. Now,
I have been overseeing her care,
so don't worry, okay?
She's going to be much better soon,
and...
Oh, Su-na.
Su-na, you're terribly malnourished
right now. Huh?
So drink some water.
You'll regain your health. Here.
Hmm?
Alright, then. Enjoy your dinners,
and don't forget,
you are our future!
- Alright, clean things up here.
- Yes, sir.
It's been over 20 hours,
and Sergeant Choi
and Sergeant Oh haven't returned.
Things could get bad for them
if they don't make it in time.
They should be okay.
Maybe we should hand out personal doses
in case of situations like this.
It's still too dangerous
for people to carry.
Besides, there's no telling what kind
of side effects we'll see going forward.
How long are
we going to have to keep injecting?
We're starting to run out of children
to bring to the apartment.
We're gonna get there.
Just be patient.
Get back to work.
They only care about themselves.
Dignity for humans?
Long gone.
This research needs to
come to fruition, right?
If we want a meaningful life...
it'll only be when...
when they realize
the sacrifices
of these evolutionary rejects
was necessary for survival.
That day will come, don't you think?
Time for a shift change.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Uh, we, uh, signed up
to see our child earlier on.
When will we be able to go see her?
A meeting? What do you mean, meeting?
The teacher said
that after we finish our work for the day,
we could sign up to visit our daughter.
Uh, there's, um...
- We don't have that policy.
- She definitely told us that earlier on.
We're happy to go to the eighth floor
if Ju-ye can't come down.
The eighth floor is especially off-limits
to regular residents.
Uh, well, where's the teacher, then?
You know what?
Where's our daughter?
What the hell do you mean
we can't go see our child?
This is ridiculous!
They're stopping them
seeing their child.
I hope our kids are okay.
Don't mind us and change shifts, everyone.
We'll talk about this tomorrow.
- Wait, wait, wait. Where's Ju-ye?
- No, look here.
Huh? Where the hell is our daughter,
you bastards?!
Listen, how many times
do I have to tell you
not to interrupt me
when I'm experimenting?
I'm sorry, sir. Too many witnesses
for me to take care of it.
Jesus, we bent over backwards
to get these kids.
So they're in
the purification facility?
Let's get down there.
Sergeant Kang, please go upstairs
and prepare the drugs and the catheter.
Right away, sir.
God, this is so embarrassing.
Let me see my daughter!
Why would you lie to us?
The teacher told us
that we would be able to see her tonight!
Right, go check with her.
- Calm down.
- Check with her.
Where's the teacher?
Why do you keep lying to us?
Hey, what's going on?
Huh? What's this about? Guys...
Please, Doctor, please tell us.
Where is Ju-ye?
You guys,
you said we could meet her.
You can't just go back on your word!
Calm down, please!
Ju-ye is doing great.
- She's all settled in now.
- Doctor, please let us see our daughter.
- Now, wait, wait, don't...
- I'm begging you!
There's no need to cry.
Please, please settle down.
Okay, fine.
Let's go to the lab to see her.
Come with me. Let's go see Ju-ye.
Let's go. Yeah.
Okay, thank you. Let's go.
{\an8}REPTILIAN REGENERATION EXPERIMENT
{\an8}CONFIRMED MANIFESTATION OF PROTEINS
IN RAT STEM CELLS
EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED ON FIVE SOLDIERS
SUCCESSFUL REGENERATION IN FIFTEEN DAYS
SEVEN 10-YEAR-OLDS, ALL DEAD
FOUR 17-YEAR-OLDS, ALL DEAD
Ju-ye...
Ju-ye.
This way.
So... so she's in here?
Why would, uh...
There, see that? She's fine.
- Ju-ye!
- Ju-ye... Ju-ye!
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
don't stimulate her in any way!
Or else you'll put her life at risk.
You can see
that she's a very valuable asset here
and giving herself for us all.
Doctor, can you explain what this is?
Is Ju-ye sick or something?
No, she's completely healthy.
It's just that kids her age
have something right here.
"The children are our future."
That's our whole motto, isn't it?
Now, now, now, here, look.
This is my daughter.
Everyone said that she was dead,
but I brought her back.
I've basically created
an undying breed of humanity.
What?
Humanity has a chance at being preserved,
thanks to you and your daughter.
Now do you understand what a vital role
she plays in this research?
Ju-ye.
Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey!
I said not to stimulate your daughter!
Jesus! I told you not to touch her! Shit!
What's wrong with her?
What's going on with our daughter?
- What's happening?
- Ju-ye!
I told you not to touch her!
Oh my God, do something!
Do something!
What's wrong with her?
What's happening to her?
- Ju-ye.
- Oh my God, Ju-ye... Is she dead?
Wake up, Ju-ye.
I was away for too long.
I told you what would happen. Now look!
- Ju-ye...
- Ju-ye?
Ju-ye!
- See this? Huh?
- Ju-ye...
You have no idea
how important this research is, do you?
I gave you food, clean water,
shelter...
Why don't you trust me?!
Clean-up crew. Clean-up crew to the lab.
Su-na,
why are you up here?
What a coincidence, huh?
I really appreciate
you having my back on this.
There's no way in hell
I could do this alone, you know?
I'm just here for Su-na.
And also 'cause
he'll shut his trap
when Su-na's around again.
I'm not a good person.
There's a lot of blood on my hands.
It's morning now.
Rise and shine.
We're leaving already?
Sure must be nice, being so young.
Very minimal side effects,
and the drugs work great on you.
I know why you're keeping
all these children.
You're using us like lab rats
so you can survive.
Oh, no, don't worry.
You're better than a lab rat.
No, we're depending on you to survive.
What happened to Ju-ye earlier
was very unfortunate.
Why are you
experimenting on children's necks?
The teenage pituitary gland generates
material that allows the process to occur.
Now, it does need a bit of fine-tuning.
Doesn't work right away.
In the classroom,
when you were drinking the water?
That activates it.
It's amazing, right?
That we're able to achieve that
with just a little water?
Where's Grandma, then?
Did you seriously believe
she's in treatment?
The weak among us need to be thinned out
so we can make way for the new breed.
Whoa, stay still.
- Hey, don't screw this up, okay?
- Trust me, alright?
Hey, how you doing?
What happened to you?
Oh, I just got into a scuffle
with some crazy gorilla motherfucker
a couple days ago.
What brings you here today?
I'm here to make a delivery, bro.
You're only supposed to come
on certain days, you know?
Oh shit.
Well, you know, I was just passing by,
so I figured I'd make a delivery
and come see my buddy while I'm at it.
Hey, what's with that?
- Look in the back.
- Yes, sir.
Shut it off.
What's going on?
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa!
Hold on to something!
Ah, slow down, slow down!
Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Hey, you son of a bitch!
You crazy bastard!
You're insane!
Ji-wan!
It's those people.
We saw them when we picked up Su-na.
We have to go warn the doctor.
Okay.
Sergeant Lee's going to
the prison underground.
Don't follow her down there.
I left a gift for her.
Hurry, let's move in!
- Please don't kill me! I'm sorry!
- Oh shit.
You don't have to shoot me.
This way.
Oh! Oh! Shit, man! Oh God! Ah!
Try to relax, Su-na.
What is it now?
Dr. Yang.
I'm sorry, sir, but it's important.
Sergeant Lee's returned,
and there's others.
From the village where we got Su-na.
I'm sure Master Sergeant Kwon
has it under control.
Looks like your friends came to see you.
Shame they won't get a chance to.
You sure it's in there?
Yeah, I'm sure.
How come no one's following us?
You guys, it's Sergeant Lee. Are you okay?
Hyung!
Your subordinates
don't seem too fond of us, huh?
Hey, snap out of it.
They're not human anymore.
Get it together!
Hey, you guys all good?
Man, what the hell are these monsters?
This was a mistake. We're doomed now.
I'm sorry.
Ah, ah, attention all residents.
As we all know, there are some intruders
in the apartment
that are threatening everybody's safety.
Stay in your homes until further notice.
Do not, under any circumstances,
go outside.
We've implemented strict security measures
on the classrooms and student dorms,
so stay exactly where you are.
Now, one more thing.
I wanna share a quick message with
our trespasser friends in the basement.
Sergeant Lee Eun-ho,
and, uh, you, the hunter person,
you won't be able to accomplish
what you want here,
so just give up and turn back
before it's too late.
And then I'll let you
walk away with your lives.
Ugh, that piece of shit.
Listen!
This is me giving you one last chance.
There's an intercom in the basement.
Press the button, and give me an answer.
"We'd like to walk away with our lives"
is option one,
and "we'd like to die a painful death
in the basement,"
that's option two!
Option one.
And, uh, we're taking Su-na too.
Let's go get our girl.
Are you coming with us?
Master Sergeant Kwon.
Do not, under any circumstances,
let them up here.
I understand, sir.
Team A, take the stairwell,
and team B, the basement.
I'll take the center.
We can't let them get up here.
It's in your best interest
that your friends don't kill
our momentum here.
If you end up dying, too,
we won't have anyone left
to take your place.
So, please,
just hang in there.
- What do we do now?
- We're almost out of bullets.
Grab their weapons.
Get out of here now!
Go find Su-na. I can handle this.
- Are you sure?
- I've got it.
Be careful.
Oh shit.
Oh, where is it? Oh shit.
Hey, hey, Ji-wan!
Ugh!
What's going on out there?
We have to go.
Hey, stay focused!
- Keep going.
- What about you though?
- Get out of here!
- Ah shit.
Lee Eun-ho.
Please don't kill us.
We're just workers. Please don't hurt us.
Relax.
I'm looking for a kid named Su-na.
Where are the rest of the kids?
The children are up on the eighth floor.
You guys should go up
to look for your children as well.
Lee Eun-ho.
Still so worried about others
that you can't find
a way out for yourself.
Su-na.
Don't shoot! Oh God!
Why are you doing this?
Ugh, my knees.
Come on, don't be like that.
There's still time for you
to make peace with this.
Join us and help us create a new world.
Well, in the world that I want,
there's no room for monsters like you.
Lee Eun-ho,
you wanna keep going till the end?
Oh God!
Where is Han Su-na?
Where is she?!
She's with the doctor.
Lead the way.
You should get out of here.
Don't you want to see your parents?
Come on, let's go.
Hey.
Don't come closer, or else I'll shoot her.
Be my guest.
That woman just... disappoints.
Master Sergeant Kwon,
have you gone completely crazy?
Hey, soldier boy.
Why aren't the elevators working
in here?
I'll take care of him. You go find Su-na.
What happened to you?
Something's on your face.
So you're the hunter, then?
Guess you're my catch of the day.
Amusing.
I've been looking for you.
Look, I don't have time. Let's do it.
I finally did it.
You weren't waiting too long, right?
At last!
You're a monster, you know that?
Do you really think
that there is any point
in saving your daughter now?
This is rare, Su-na.
It usually takes much longer to wake up.
Nice to be young, I guess.
Grandma always said that
everybody...
...is always bound to reap
whatever seeds they sow.
You will suffer the consequences
for everything that you've done.
Your daughter
would never approve of
who you are now.
You want me to just cut off your tongue?
You said the contents needed
a little fine-tuning, right?
That strange water
that you gave all of us,
I didn't drink a drop of it.
Oh, you... Shit.
It's amazing, right?
That we can achieve that
with just a little water?
Oh God! Doctor!
Don't come closer.
Drop the gun.
Drop the gun!
God damn it.
You crazy bastard!
- So-yeon. Get So-yeon first.
- What?
I said to go pack So-yeon up first!
Oh, yes.
Ugh, why won't you bastards
just die already?
You can't kill us.
You sure?
Ugh!
Ah shit, that's an ugly mug.
Kim Hak-yong!
Are you alright? What happened?
Huh? What happened to you? Huh?
Ji-wan!
Alright, let's go.
Ah, come on, come on!
Oh God, Doctor...
Wait!
Doctor, save me. Save me, Doctor.
You,
you said you would save me.
The shot. Oh God, where's the shot?
You're gonna die even if you take it.
No, no...
No, don't do it! Don't do it!
You son of a bitch!
What the...? What just happened up there?
What is happening?
It's okay, sweetheart. Huh?
We can just start over.
You believe in your dad, right?
Hey, Ji-wan!
Hey, Ji-wan!
Hey. Hey.
Hey, wake up. Hey.
Su-na.
Su-na.
Su-na, you alright?
Su-na, are you okay?
You're here...
Alright.
Let's get out of here.
What are they doing? I made an order
for everybody to stay in their rooms.
Everybody!
- It's Dr. Yang!
- Stay away from our children!
- Our child is in the building!
- What did you do, huh?
You're asking the wrong person.
Get out of the way!
No, no, no!
We've done everything you told us.
What have you been doing to our kids?
Let go!
You people,
you were all living in luxury,
pawning off your kids, huh?
Isn't it a little late
to start pretending that you care?
No, you can't get away with it!
You won't get away!
Get him away from that! Grab that!
So-yeon! So-yeon!
- Is everyone alright?
- Yeah.
Let's get Yang Gi-su.
We might lose him if we go together.
You take the kids and move down.
Understood.
Let's go.
Be careful, Nam San.
Hurry.
What the fuck is in the bag?
You will pay for this!
You're gonna rot!
Wait!
What? He... he's a monster! A monster!
You...
you pieces of shit, you...
Oh my God.
Die!
All of you, just die already! Die!
You all deserve to die, all of you.
I should kill every one of you.
Good-for-nothing, evolutionary rejects!
Your death is coming!
No, no.
No...
So-yeon.
So-yeon, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
I'm... I'll bring you back, So-yeon.
It's okay. It's okay.
Oh, I'm so sorry!
My little girl.
Yang Gi-su!
Don't come any closer!
Stay right there!
I have to save my daughter.
Stay where you are!
Yeah!
That's enough, you monster!
Look at what you did!
You couldn't save anybody,
not even your little girl.
You've ruined everything.
You've ruined the whole plan.
I was right all along.
And you've ruined everything.
You ruined...
you ruined...
Come on. Let's go.
What are you gonna do now?
I think I'll stay here
and start over again.
It's raining!
It's raining!
- Oh my goodness!
- Let's go home now. I'm ready.
Right, let's go.
God, that's refreshing!
I'm so happy to be back, Mom! Dad!
- Line up properly, people!
- Got anything good for us?
Everybody, step forward.
Su-na!
Su-na,
white pigs like these
are chock-full of flavor.
- Mmm...
- Hmm?
Oh? Um, whoa...
Good luck with that, huh?
- What do you mean by that? What?
- Hey, Ma! Over here!
"Ma"? What're you doing?
Uh, thanks, but I'm sober.
What's with that ribbon she's wearing?
Let me through.
- Whoa!
- Where are you going?
I've suffered enough.
Leave me alone.
