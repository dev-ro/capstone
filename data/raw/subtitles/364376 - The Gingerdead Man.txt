[WOMAN SCREAMING]
[BELL DINGS]
This ain't right.
We've got to fight back.
Now, look,
You bastard,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
[GRUNTS]
[GROANING]
There's somebody in here.
I smell something
in the air.
Smells feminine.
[CRYING]
Hey,
I'm... I'm unarmed.
Okay?
Hold on.
It was my dad.
Look, what do you...
What do you want with us?
We don't have anything.
Okay, just...
Just take your stuff and...
And get out of here.
Shut up.
Put your gun down please.
Shut up.
Say it again
and mean it.
Put... Put your gun down
please.
Think you're ordering me?
Put your gun down please.
You sound
like a sissy, boy.
Put your gun down please.
Now you're sounding
like my high school principal.
Just put your gun down
please.
I'm sorry that's your dad,
but welcome to Earth, pal.
What do you think?
Gun's right in front of me.
[GRUNTS]
[CRYING]
When are kids gonna learn?
[GIRL CRYING]
Kitty?
Here kitty.
Here kitty.
Here kitty.
Here kitty, kitty, kitty.
Let me see you.
You don't have to be afraid.
The next time
you go out to a place,
I want you
to look for something safe.
And I'm required to do
what my mother always taught me.
And that's to finish
what I started.
And I'm not gonna kill you.
But I have to honor
my mother.
Goddamn.
Bloody...
[SHOUTS]
[SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE]
Oh, fuck.
[***]
Not bad.
Story of my life.
Happy birthday,
big brother.
I almost forgot.
I guess we won't
be driving to Dallas
To celebrate the big 2-1
after all, huh?
Well, wherever you are up there,
I hope they have strippers
And Lonestar.
I miss you guys.
MAN:
I'll get you for this.
Even from beyond the grave
Because my mama's a witch
in Coorsborough.
You are finished.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Could you use
the front entrance please?
[KNOCKING CONTINUES]
Brick?
Calm down, Sarah.
It's just
a delivery person.
Believe it or not,
little lady,
The missing supplies
finally reared their ugly heads.
Thanks, Brick.
Something else was just left
at the back porch too.
Cool. Must be
that gingerbread seasoning.
But, more importantly,
I've got two tickets
for tonight's Wrestlepalooza.
They're even gonna
let amateurs compete tonight.
A mosh pit of tag team damage
and body slammage.
[GRUNTS]
This could be my shot
at the big time.
And in this corner,
Straight from
Hell's Kitchen,
The Butcher Baker.
Sounds like fun.
Get me some of that seasoning,
will you?
I'll test some out
and put it in the muffins.
Sure.
You okay, Sarah?
Yeah. Sorry.
Today would have been
Jeremy's birthday.
He wanted to spend it
at the titty bar.
[CHUCKLES]
Can you blame him?
You know, I still
keep expecting him
To show up
for work every day.
Your dad
putting on his apron,
Pounding the dough.
And Jeremy.
Jeremy coming in late
because he overslept.
Telling Dad
some dirty joke
To keep him
from getting yelled at.
[LAUGHING]
[SHOUTS]
Heck.
Oh, don't move,
Brick.
Do you want me
to take you to the doctor?
[SIGHS]
The Butcher Baker
needs no doctor.
He can always
take the heat.
Come on, Brick.
Go.
I'm okay. Really.
I can take you to get stitches
if you need it.
Okay.
[GROANS]
WOMAN:
Sarah!
What is it, Julia?
This says that Findlemeyer
was executed two days ago.
That's all you wanted?
The way you were shouting,
I thought it was an emergency.
[LAUGHS]
This is great news.
After two years that
loco pendejo is finally dead.
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
Are you gonna finish
that birthday cake
Because that's
concerning me more now.
Yeah, sure, sure.
It also says here
That after they fried him
in the chair,
They cremated him
And sent his ashes
to his mother in Coorsborough.
How sick is that?
Greetings,
Mass Mercenary.
We meet at last.
Prepare to meet your maker
for tonight,
Your ass is toast.
Your ass.
Your ass is toast.
[FAINT WHISPERING]
The birthday cake?
Oh. Sure thing, boss.
Sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean
to be short with you.
It's just,
you know, helping,
Especially with Mom.
I know.
It's my bad.
I'll do better.
[LOUD BANG]
Them bastards think
They're gonna get the better
of me, do they?
[LAUGHS]
We'll see about that.
[GUN COCKS]
[GUN COCKS]
[LAUGHS]
That ought to teach you!
[LAUGHING]
What are you doing?
Oh, them bastards think
they can just come in here
And take over, Sarah.
And we're not gonna let 'em.
I think maybe you've had enough
for one evening, Mrs. Leigh.
Oh, now, you looking
to get fired girl.
Mom, why don't you go home
and get some rest?
No, Sarah,
listen to me.
Them sons of bitches
think they can just move in here
And take over.
And they... They wanna
run us out of business.
And... And... And they...
They can do it too.
Because what chance
do we got
Up against some big old
statewide chain?
I mean, just look at us.
No one's gonna
run you out.
Okay?
Listen to me, Mom,
You and Dad built this place
from the ground on up,
And there is no way
I'm gonna let anyone
Take that away
from you.
You promise?
Promise.
Come on, now.
Julia will give you
a ride home.
Okey-dokey.
I'll be home
in a bit.
Come on, Mrs. Leigh,
let's go.
All right. Well, I'm just gonna
take a little nap and...
And then I'll come back over
and help you.
Okay?
Okay.
Let's go.
[FAINT WHISPERING]
[CAR HORN HONKING]
What in the hell
did you do to my banner?
Well, I didn't...
Now, you just...
You listen here, girl.
[CHUCKLES]
I thought we were gonna
handle this like adults.
Like business people.
Now, there is no call
for warranting destructiveness
And vandalism.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I'll pay for the banner.
You're damn straight.
Is there anything else
you wanted of me?
If not, I gotta
get back to work.
Well, now, that's
what I like about you.
Right down to brass tacks.
Just like your mama.
Except without all the...
[WHISTLES]
Drinking, of course.
Here's the deal.
A year from now, my place,
it's gonna be up and running.
Finest eatery in four counties.
Now, I can't have my customers
looking across the street
At this run down pie shop.
Let's take care of this.
Quick, clean.
No lawyers,
no middlemen,
No bullshit.
You and your mama,
you take that money,
You have a nice life.
So you can tear down
our place?
Well, that's progress,
sonny.
Out with the old,
in with the new.
Two thousand dollars goes
a long way at Walmart, Sarah.
Now, you remember my daughter
Lorna, don't you?
Yeah, she's hard to forget.
Heh.
Did I tell you
she was just named
Miss Pretty Face
of Waco?
It's only the 10th time
you've reminded me.
You know, with my help,
Lorna's gonna make something
of herself.
Be a big star.
I can help finance
her modeling career
Because I worked hard
my whole life.
Busted my hump so that
I could provide for me.
Now, you think about my offer,
you hear?
Fifty thousand dollars.
That'd make it so you
and your drunk mama
Don't have to
bust your humps.
Why don't you
hold your breath?
You overheard?
I hate that guy.
Me too.
Especially
when he's right.
Whoa. Hold up.
You're not telling me
you're gonna let that loser
Bully you into selling.
He's a jerk.
But he makes sense.
Ever since Dad
and Jeremy died
Everything's kind of...
I mean,
Look at this place.
So we'll fix it.
We'll paint it.
It'll be good as new.
It's not just the blue
that needs fixing.
So does my mom.
My mom's drinking.
Hey, it'll get better.
[CRYING]
I don't know.
I've never been
at that point in my life.
When everything's
so, so messed up
That you don't even know
where to start to fix it.
[SNIFFS]
I don't want to.
When I wake up,
I turn my back
on what little I have
And just...
Disappear somewhere,
you know?
Just going
and starting over.
You just had
a couple bad years is all.
You get knocked to the mat,
You have to
get back up again.
I'm so scared.
Pulling up carpets,
Everything will be okay.
I took that bread
out of the oven.
Got that gingerbread dough
mixing.
[CHUCKLES]
You're mean, you know.
Does that mean I have a date
for the rest the palooza?
Right.
I knew that.
Why don't you take off early?
But the cookies, they-they...
I'll finish them.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Didn't you just tell me
to get up off the mat?
[GROWLS PLAYFULLY]
Right you are, boss.
See you bright and early.
[***]
[MECHANICAL WHIRRING]
[LIGHTS FLICKERING]
Okay.
Julia?
[***]
What are you
doing in here?
Should have figured you'd still
be here on a Friday night.
[RAT SQUEAKING]
Oh, you little bitch!
You're not going anywhere, how
dare you bring that rat in here.
I thought $50,000
was too much for you?
I told daddy
you'd never take it anyways.
So you thought
you'd get me shut down
By the health department
instead?
[SCREAMS]
[***]
[HISSING]
We tried to be fair!
Asses like you
know what's going on.
[SCREAMING]
Ugh, my face!
[MUMBLING ANGRILY]
[BUZZING]
[***]
[LAUGHING]
Amos, are you in on this?
I am in on what?
Lorna, I've been waiting in that
car forever for you.
You said youse was just gonna
leave a note.
A note?
Yeah, right.
How many notes eat cheese
and live in a sewer?
Oh, come on, Amos,
let's get out of here.
Whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.
What the hell went on in here?
[LOUD RUMBLING]
Yet another reason
to board up this dump.
[CHUCKLING]
[SCREAMS]
There's...
There's something in there.
There's something
alive in there.
Maybe it's the rat.
Lorna, don't you think
you need to quit?
Don't! I'm serious!
Don't open it!
You've been using too much
plates in your head.
Jesus!
What the hell
you've been baking?
Well, whatever it is,
I think you over-cooked it.
On the contrary...
They did just fine.
[CHUCKLING MENACINGLY]
What the hell is that?
Well it sure ain't
the Pillsbury fucking Doughboy.
[GRUNTS]
That things voice...
Something about it.
Lorna, come on.
LORNA:
What the hell was that thing?
SARAH:
I don't know.
Well, it looked like
a gingerbread man.
That's what I was baking.
What are you getting at?
Well, that was what was supposed
to be in the big pan
I pulled out of the oven.
A big gingerbread man.
Ah, wait, wait...
Are you telling me
that that thing
Is a cookie you were baking?
That's crazy!
Crazy.
Okay, do you have a magic oven?
This isn't funny, Amos.
All right, look,
I'll admit, okay,
When this shit first happened
I was a little spooked
For like a second.
But it's a gag.
It's got to be,
I bet you anything. Anything.
That it's that geek
who works for you
Who's always
in the restroom.
Who? Brick?
Yeah, him.
It's a big joke.
A big, funny "ha-ha".
You guys saw that thing, right?
It had to be fake.
No, but it was walking
and it was talking out there.
It was alive.
Okay, this ain't no gag.
It's black magic.
Oh, my God.
No, really.
Look, it's like,
a couple of years ago,
When me and some of my friends
took out this Ouija Board,
Okay, and we started putting out
fingers on it and... It...
On this pointy plastic thingy
And it was moving around and it
was spelling out things for us.
It was this message from this
dead girl named Rosalyn. And...
She told us that some psycho
Had killed her
and cut her up into pieces
And then wrapped her in tinfoil.
And then mailed it off
all across the country
To her relatives.
It spelled all the out for you?
Lorna, that's longer
than any book you ever read
In your entire life.
Look, I am serious!
Okay, a couple of weeks after
that I saw on the news
How the cops arrested some guy
for cutting up girls body parts
And mailing them off.
Talk about going postal.
Look, this black magic shit
is for real.
And that thing out there
is bad news
And I don't want
to have any part of it.
Lorna, Lorna, Lorna.
Why do you guys
want to leave so bad?
Maybe she's right, Amos.
Maybe we should take off.
And take off running, right?
One thing...
Whatever it is,
'Cause boys,
I got a real bad feeling.
If it's somebody playing a
prank, which I think it is,
I'll clobber 'em.
If that thing is real,
I say we grab that motherfucker.
And we take it in
to Leno, Letterman...
How much dough can you make
from a talking cookie?
Huh. Dough. Cookie.
[CHUCKLES]
Get it?
[MOCKINGLY]
Ha-ha.
All right, whatever it is,
don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.
Let's go.
[***]
[CREATURE MUNCHING LOUDLY]
[CREATURE BURPS]
Think we got him?
Hold on, he's mine now.
Uh, guys...
Must have shifted off.
Good fucking riddance.
Wait, Lorna, please.
Hold on.
[DOOR OPENING]
Guess what?
It's dead.
Unbelievable.
Here.
[DIALING]
[SIGHS]
Daddy.
Look, you have got to come and
get me I'm at Betty's Bakery
And we got homicidal baked goods
after us.
You heard me.
Daddy?
Daddy!
Goddamn it.
[SIGHS]
I must have forgot
to charge it.
You dumb shit.
Why didn't you call the cops?
Shut your pie hole.
[***]
Hello?
What the hell
is happening in here?
This ain't right.
[POT CLANGING]
[GASPS]
[SQUEAKING]
This place is filthy.
I notice you, you bastards.
I'm gonna get my gun.
[CREATURE LAUGHING]
Sarah?
Hello?
[RUSTLING]
Who's in here?
[RUSTLING CONTINUES]
Who did this?
[***]
Hello?
He can't get you from the grave.
It's wrong,
don't start worrying.
Just get a hold of yourself now.
He can't hurt you.
You sure about that?
[CHUCKLING]
[BREATHING HEAVILY]
That's the end of drinking this.
Oh, yeah.
I'm real, all right.
[CHUCKLING]
[HUMMING]
[CONTINUES TO CHUCKLE]
Ever try a lady finger?
[CREATURE YELLS]
[SCREAMING]
What was that?
Maybe it was your little friend.
What do you mean by that?
You know what I mean.
Lorna, shut up.
Siding with the enemy, Amos?
She ain't the enemy.
LORNA:
Really?
Maybe you didn't hear what
happened back there,
But that little bastard
recognized her from somewhere.
Am I right?
Look, I'm gonna go to the car
and I'm gonna get your phone
That is,
if you charged it.
That thing may be out there
somewhere.
Fuck it.
[***]
Maybe you really should
stop drinking, you lush.
What are you?
Not what, honey, who.
Don't you recognize
my pretty voice?
Millard.
There you go.
[DOOR OPENING]
[BETTY MOANING]
Betty!
[GASPS]
Betty.
What are you doing sneaking out
the backdoor without me knowing?
Sarah told me to keep an eye
on you, I can't let her down.
Oh, Mrs. Leigh, I had a feeling
you'd sneak back here
Looking for your stash.
What happened?
There was this man.
A gingerbread man.
Mrs. Leigh... uh.
A gingerbread man?
[SIGHS]
Look, I'll get you home.
We gotta go.
Go.
Let's go.
It's go... He's got a knife.
Right.
[SCREAMS]
That's gonna leave a mark.
[CHUCKLES]
[***]
So how long have you and Amos
been together?
Me and Amos?
[LAUGHS]
Get real, girl.
It was nothing
but stupid fun, is all.
Hm.
You're acting like
it was more than that.
It's 'cause he was flirting
with you.
See when he was with me,
I don't want him making googly
eyes at nobody but me.
Even though he's not with me.
Got it?
I see.
And what about
what he wants?
[LAUGHS]
Honey, you got a lot to learn.
[BELL ON DOOR DINGS]
Guess what?
Here's part
of your things.
Shit.
[BUZZING]
Shit.
You already
said that.
Maybe it's the storm,
We got power problems
when the weather gets bad.
Or maybe
it's that fucking Keebler Elf.
You got a generator?
In the back.
Okay, that would be real smart,
why don't we just take off.
Uh-uh,
he could get us outside.
No, no.
Let's get the lights on.
I want to see this fucker
when I blast him to crumbs.
Lorna Dean, what the hell
did you bring me out here for?
Oh, now that makes sense.
That tattooed punk got you up
to no good again I bet.
Hm.
So what, the generator's
right through here?
Yeah.
I wish
you'd put that gun away.
But we might need it.
I know.
But if you could just
put it down while I'm here.
Oh, okay.
Is that better?
Yeah.
Thanks, it just makes me nervous
looking at those things.
It's stupid, I know.
No, no, it's not stupid.
I'm sorry,
I wasn't thinking...
No, it's all right
it's my problem not yours.
'Cause you know, I'm not very
good at those kind of things.
With people's emotions.
Hell, why do you think
I'm with Lorna?
Girl got, like, no emotion.
She's about as cold
as a Milk Creek catfish.
[CHUCKLES]
Yeah, I think she goes out
with me 'cause she thinks
I'm pretty strange
and that you know,
Makes her look tough.
It's probably her
way of bossing me
Around 'cause
I'm a delinquent.
I never thought of you
as a delinquent.
Get out of here.
Well, I probably spend more time
counting off
Then you spend baking pies.
Don't make yourself sound like
a bigger pansy than you are.
Excuse me.
You don't remember,
do you?
What?
Coming to my birthday party.
What?
Ah, I guess it's the past
anyway.
I was six.
When you were living with your
mom and dad on Hopper Street.
I went to your birthday party?
Yeah, you tried to kiss me near
the punchbowl.
Get outta here.
I gave you a bloody nose.
Oh, my God.
You're right,
I remember that.
Yeah, so you're not as tough
as you like to think you are.
Maybe I got turned
when I was little.
Ever think about that?
Oh, so that's why you stick
around with Lorna?
Hell, I stick around with Lorna
because she pays the bills,
Come on,
let's fix this generator.
All right.
[SIGHS]
Lorna, if you and that worthless
greaseball are causing trouble,
I will hide you both.
Where are you, Lorna?
Come on out, darling.
Amos?
[CAR ENGINE STARTS]

[MILLARD GRUNTING]
[MILLARD CHUCKLING]
What the fuck are you doing?
[LAUGHING]
Hold it, hold it!
[TIRES SCREECH]
[YELLING]
[SPLATTERING]
Shit.
You all right?
Yeah.
Look, I'm really sorry about
what's going on with your place.
I had no idea Lorna was being
so shitty with you.
Lord knows her daddy
ain't no picnic either.
Thanks.
Doesn't really matter.
They went anyway.
I wonder if this thing
has any gas.
What do you mean "they went"?
To see Mom.
Tell her we had
to close, I mean.
Tell her we've had things
been happening.
And this...
What's that?
Pillsbury Doughboy?
It's just the last straw.
Listen, you can't
go pulling stakes
Just because Lorna and Jimmy
Dean are putting up a stand.
Yeah. That's easy
for you to say.
Can't let them scare you.
Yeah.
There's nothing really
keeping us here anymore.
Nothing that comes
to mind anyway.
Come on, let's get out of here.
[***]
Why don't we got
no lights?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Can't you do anything right?
Lorna, I've told you...
Leave him alone.
Oh, so that's how it is, huh?
Why do you always need to be
so bitchy with everybody?
So now I'm a bitch...?
You've always been a bitch.
Guys, guys, guys!
Look at that.
[***]
Should we open it?
We better.
You're not actually
going to open that?
Somebody might
be hurt in there.
Oh, you two morons
belong together.
Screw this shit, I'm going
outside to get my daddy.
[***]
[MOANING]
She gonna be okay?
She's got a knock on her head,
but she's still breathing.
What is that fucker anyway?
I think I know what.
I mean, who it is.
Daddy?
Daddy?
Oh, God, no.
No, no, no, Daddy.
No. Daddy?
No, you can't go.
Daddy!
Daddy. Daddy, no.
You mean the world to me, Daddy.
I'll miss you, Daddy.
Hey, wait a minute,
you mean to tell me that...?
I know it sounds crazy.
Don't know how it happened.
It's the only thing
that makes sense.
Even if it is Twilight Zone
kind of sense.
The guy that killed
Jeremy and your daddy?
Um-hm.
That you helped send
to the electric chair?
Millard Findlemeyer
has come back from the dead
To get revenge on you
Inside a cookie?
I'm going to clean
that stuff off,
Put her in that cooker
and she won't get hypothermia.
That bump on her head
don't look so good.
Yeah. I don't think she got
a concussion, she's just...
She's in shock right now.
I think it's wearing off.
How the hell
do you know all that?
Educated guess.
And I've been taking
some night classes
At the community college.
Just in case I don't want
to be baking pies
For the rest of my life.
Yeah? What kind of classes?
Nursing.
It's silly, huh?
No, it ain't silly.
But, why nursing?
I don't know,
I just like helping people.
Okay, but why nursing?
I mean, why not a doctor?
Hell, be a surgeon?
A smart, pretty girl like you
can do whatever she wants.
Sorry.
I don't know why
I just did that.
Sure beats a punch
in the nose.

Where is he?

No!
Don't go out there.
He just killed Daddy out there.

I'm talking to you.
Want a piece of me?

I'm gonna kick your ass.
I'm gonna kick your rat ass.
LORNA:
Oh, my God. Look at me.
You'll be okay.
Okay? You call this "okay"?
I am Miss Pretty Face of Waco.
I was Miss Pretty Face of Waco.
Now I'm nothing but a freak.
AMOS:
Lorna, it don't look that bad.
Well, that's easy
for you to say,
You're ugly.
Look, get out of my way.
What the hell happened to her?
Is she dead?
No, she's all right.
Well, nothing's all right
around here.
Okay, we have got
to out of here.
He could get us out there too,
like he did your dad.
Listen, nobody's leaving.
We're sticking together, okay?
You guys can stay
if you want to,
But that Poppin' Fresh fucker's
already gotten a hold of my face
And I'll be damned
if he gets anything else.
Wait, Lorna.

[MILLARD LAUGHING]
[SHRIEKS]
Holy shit.
[WHIMPERING]
A fucking booby trap.
Okay, Sarah. Sarah, Sarah.
Come on. Hey.
We got to get going.
Come on, let's do this.
[***]
Hey, Millard,
Why did you kill her, huh?
Why did you kill Jeremy?
[MILLARD CHUCKLING, SNARLING]
SARAH:
It's me you're after.
Why don't you come and get me?
Look out!
[MILLARD LAUGHING]
Let's go!
Come on!
Sarah, come here.
If he's over there,
we can go out the back.
And then what?
Besides, we can't
just leave Julia.
Shit. You're right.
Show yourself, you little
half-baked fucker!
I swear to God
I won't think twice.
Hang on, Amos,
I just want to go.
Yeah, well, it's working.
He just wants you to follow him,
don't listen to him.
MILLARD:
Your old man and your brother
were stupid back at that diner.
They tried to stop me,
But she didn't
because she was afraid.
Just like now. Ha-ha-ha.
Don't listen to him, he's just
trying to get you to go.
Mmm.
You can't stay
scared forever, Sarah.
Um-hm. Ha-ha-ha.
Where'd he go?
[WHIMPERING]
He was already there.
[SCREAMING INDISTINCTLY]
Sarah, Sarah, it looks like he
set up the point or something.
SARAH:
The oven.
MILLARD:
I said you were smoked.
Turn it off!
[SCREAMING]
Oh, my God.
Oh! Please hurry!
[MILLARD TAUNTING INDISTINCTLY]
[SCREAMING]
MILLARD:
Say good night, cream puff.
[THUD]
[BANGING]
MILLARD:
Now you know what
it feels like to fry, bitch.
[COUGHING]
[MILLARD CHUCKLING]
Oh, yes. Burn, bitch.
Hm? Fudge.
[BANGING]
[COUGHING, WHEEZING]
[PANTING]
Amos?
Amos?
[WHIMPERING]
MILLARD:
Ah, ain't that sweet?
I see a sappy
love story brewing.
Looking for this? Ha-ha-ha.
Baby, it's all over
but the cryin'.
Brick?
What the fuck?
Whoa.
I was driving back
to Wrestlepalooza,
Saw you in the windows.
You got to get out of here.
Don't worry, I can handle this.
Now it's time
to meet your maker.
Prepare to face
the Butcher Baker.
For tonight your ass is toast.
You got to be shitting me.
Let's finish this.
Oops.
[GUNSHOTS]
[LAUGHING]
Take that.
[GUNSHOTS]
[GRUNTS]
You whore!
Eat me, you punk bitch.
Butcher Baker's no one's bitch.
MILLARD:
Hey, fucker.
[YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
Are you kidding me?
[CRUNCHING]
[BURPS]
Got milk?
MILLARD:
Save room for desert because
I'm coming back for you.
So, now we know
who's most macho, huh?
Butcher Baker.
[GIGGLES]
Yeah. Butcher Baker.
All right.
[GROANING]
[GROANS]
How's she doing?
Oh, Sarah. What happened?
Shh.
There was this
horrible little man.
He cut off my finger.
Can you help me?
Oh, it hurts.
[TAP RUNNING]
[***]
[IN MILLARD'S VOICE]
It's not over yet, girl.
Not by a long shot.
[WHIMPERING]
Oh, my God.
SARAH:
Don't look. Don't look.
It's going to be okay.
It's okay.
I'm going to go get Brick.
It's okay.
Brick? Brick?
Brick?
Brick?
Ah. You scared
the hell out of me.
Been looking all over
for you. Come on.
Get your neck looked at.
You okay?
I've never been better, toots.
Millard?
How sweet, she remembers.
Nope, not Brick anymore,
it's only Millard now.
Time for us to finish
our business.
Please.
I told you, he's through.
Butcher Baker's been carved up
for the last time.
Now give me some sugar, baby.
[SCREAMING]
Sarah!
No, no, no, no.
Wait here.
He's going to check.
Now it's time to do like my
momma always taught me...
AMOS:
Too late, cookie man.
MILLARD:
Who do you think could kick your
butt from here to tomorrow?
The Candyman can.
Amos.
Don't worry, baby.
Except for the little fucker.
Did your mom ever
teach you about this?
MILLARD:
Looky there, just like magic.
You couldn't stop
me back at the diner,
When I took care of your old man
and your pussy brother,
And you ain't gonna stop me now.
I was scared of you
back at the diner,
But I'm through with being
scared of you, Millard.
[SHRIEKING]
[MILLARD SCREAMING]
[BANGING ON DOOR]
[SNIFFLING]
Oh, Brick.
Hey, it wasn't him no more.
It was Findlemeyer.
What do you trace?
[***]
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
Thanks for your help today.
No, thank you, Emma.
Hospital first.
MAN:
Hey, Betty, how are you?
That's Betty Leigh?
She looks
so much better.
Oh, hi, Simon.
Hi, Phillip.
Hi. Do you have
any gingerbread cookies?
Not if you're lucky
I don't.
Actually, an older lady
stopped by
Just a few minutes ago
And dropped off some of these
cute little rascals.
Couldn't you just die?
