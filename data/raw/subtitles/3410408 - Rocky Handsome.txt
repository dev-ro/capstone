Touch them
if you buy them...
It's all fresh...
If you want fresher, then
catch them yourself, from the sea.
Ruksha, you'll catch a cold, what are you doing here?
I'm dancing with drops of water.
- Very romantic.
This is nothing...
Now I'll sing a song.
"As I've attained You,
I've gotten everything."
"My heart has reached the sky to the highest."
"My body, my soul, will be for you soon."
"You are my everything."
"My world, just you."
"Hug Me, be my world."
"I want to dive into your eyes to see the dream."
"I want to be with you again."
"If I'm in a difficult situation, i turn myself to you."
"My final destination is you."
"I only think of you, above anything."
"My heart has reached the sky with you."
"My body, my soul, will be for you soon."
"Because the doors of my heart only open to you."
"I started to love you dearly."
"With all my heart."
"Always be with you."
"You are my everything."
"My heart has reached the sky with you."
"My body, my soul, will be for you soon."
"My world just you."
"Hug Me, be my world."
Come out, thief.
I'm not stealing now...
I swear.
Also, i didn't steal the milk packet.
Check me, if you want.
You know ayush, Handsome?
Accidentally, I met him at school today.
Now we're the gossip of the boys at school,
they say i like ayush.
Stupid boys, I don't like them.
They're really annoying.
You're so cruel.
500 rupees?
250 rupees.
- But i put in some songs.
Songs? Which ones?
Minnie pie!
Wait!
Account settled.
Fish...
I love fish Curry.
Do you know what this is?
What's that?
This? Saint Maria.
The patriot saint of orphans.
What?
What will you do with that money?
Nail arts!
One day, I'll own a nail parlor.
Many girls at school come to me.
Do you want to do your nails?
Actually, boys have been doing their nails, too.
Are you a gangster?
Everybody's saying you committed a crime.
They say you're hiding here.
My mother warned me, too.
And you?
What do you think?
I don't believe it.
Shit... my mother.
Don't tell her I'm here.
Or i won't finish the curry.
Handsome, is Naomi here?
No.
But I heard her voice.
That happens when you use drugs.
Very funny.
So? Won't you open the door?
I already warned you, handsome.
You know i don't like this.
Naomi, I know you're in there.
Naomi, come out now.
Handsome I told you before...
I don't like Naomi around you.
What the hell, open the door,
Open...
She's not here.
Sorry.
Anyways, i need some money.
I promise...
when my mother's friend leaves,
I'll go back home.
You know what
the people usually call you?
Handsome.
Wanna know my nickname?
I don't like saying it.
Dustbin.
Everybody's saying
that mom kicked a dustbin...
When she discovered she was pregnant.
That's why i was nicknamed 'dustbin'.
Funny isn't it? Dustbin.
I didn't have the best nail paint, But...
...I hope you like it.
Seychelles?
Stop acting so innocent...
Does your mom have a phone number?
Answer me.
Ma'am, please!
Unbelievable what's happening with Goa...
Everywhere there's dirt like this....
Don't stare at me..
Is this how your parents teach you to behave?
Tell me...
Did you steal this boy's bag?
I didn't steal...
His school bag probably looks like mine.
liar, liar, pants on fire!
That's not your school bag.
Is your mom at home?
Daddy?
Any relatives?
You have a daddy?
Is that your daddy?
Excuse me, sir!
Sir...
You're angry...
Didn't i tell you not to steal?
I'll pay for it.
Never mind.
Children always make mistakes.
Then they learn from their mistakes.
After bringing them into this world,
our duty isn't over.
I always see her alone...
She needs some affection.
Go to her, try to act like another father.
And she will be fine.
Give me back the mp3 player.
Handsome...
I have no money to give you.
But take this...
It can be useful...
Protects you from evil.
If this is with you...
Nobody can harm you.
Handsome...
you're ashamed to say...
That you know me.
Everyone pretends...
that they don't know me.
Even at School.
My mom said...
If you get lost, or forget...
Your phone number or address...
Then don't come back home.
When she drinks a lot...
She always says,
Both of us should die.
I was angry with that fat woman...
Because she hit me..
But you...
You're even worse.
But I don't hate you.
If I'd hate you...
There would be nothing
to like In this world.
I can't hate you.
Run...
Get out of here.
Handsome, please!
ONE MONTH EARLIER...
Found anything, sir?
His clothes.
nothing more.
What do you want?
Because of drugs and crime gangs...
Foreigners don't leave Goa
after their visa expires.
We'll discuss this at the office?
we've talked enough, sir.
let's get to work.
We have a long list.
Drug business in Goa means 'Mantu'.
He brings in the drugs
and handles all the peddlers.
This football...
is Mantu's right arm.
He just obeys orders, without thinking twice.
Handles Mantu's main business.
Adwin.
Another familiar face.
He leads the distribution of goods on the street.
But he knows the law very well.
Pereira brothers.
Luke and Kevin.
They are connected with Mantu.
They meet often, for small deals.
These brothers are
politically connected.
That's Andile, Thai bodyguard.
Handles all the dirty work...
Leaving no evidence behind.
Dr. Jayaram was arrested for
working with illegal kidney transplants.
He claimed to be working for the two brothers...
He refused to do so in the next statement.
We have no evidence against the brothers.
A tourist's visa expires,
some want to add extra days...
They end up scammed.
Paying money or selling their goods in a pawnshop...
To add another day to stay in Goa.
If they can't repay their debts...
They are drilled and...
They became drug peddlers for the gang.
The gang is involved in
organs sale, especially kidneys.
The gang has small children...
Used for begging in the streets,
child prostitution or child trafficking...
One name is known.
Carla Aunty!
We got this information from
a child street beggar.
So we heard the names of
the aunt, the uncle, and now what?
We're not journalists, we're Police officers.
Sir, Police officers, but as long as
we have no evidence, our hands are tied.
Not even a statement from anybody,
no evidence...
to get them arrested.
Sir, if you want to clean this city,
then we have to do something.
We will.
I think we already started.
Gather as much statements
and evidence as possible.
A month.
Give me a month, sir!
"Hello!
There are no debts in love."
"Whatever You owe me, give it to me right now"
"Hello!
The intoxication of sleep that is filled in my eyes."
"Belongs only to You, take it."
"These are like butterflies"
"If they fly away, if they change their path"
"You won't be able to find them again"
"My lips which are like glasses (full of nectar) and these pink moments are all Yours"
"Remove this cloth of shame/shyness slowly slowly."
"Life is limited to only tonight"
"Tomorrow You'll be someplace else, and so will I."
"Destiny is made right here."
"The phase of thirst ends here"
"Hello!
If these nights pass, You won't find them again"
"They are Yours for now, live them to the fullest extent."
"Hello!
This lane of beauty is like a branch of the Moon."
"Drink this sharbat-like glass of alcohol."
"These are like butterflies"
"If they fly away, if they change their path"
"You won't be able to find them again."
"My lips which are like glasses (full of nectar) and these pink moments are all Yours."
"Remove this cloth of shame/shyness slowly slowly."
Speak, francis.
Football's here.
You're needed here.
I'm there in 2 minutes.
- OK!
Good morning!
Game time.
Football's here.
Sir, we call in the backup team?
Are you afraid?
We don't need a backup team.
we go in together.
We must grab Football, got it?
Hello!
- Come here.
"In every style/grace there's vividness ."
"These beautiful bodies are like silken threads."
"This is the only place which is called paradise on Earth."
"Time is telling You to move closer to me."
Sir, the waiter received a delivery.
Follow him.
"Hello!
My impoverishment is becoming richer."
"Whatever I am losing, let me lose it."
"This journey of dreams is only till the night lasts."
"Whatever happens to You, let it happen."
"These are like butterflies"
"If they fly away, if they change their path."
"You won't be able to find them again"
"My lips which are like glasses and these pink moments are all Yours"
"Remove this cloth of shame slowly slowly, "
Don't you know who I am?
No.
You should know...
Move aside...
Yes I have the goods.
I'm coming.
Sir, Football's getting up, sir.
But the waiter has disappeared.
Sir, he's going out.
The waiter has the bag, Are you sure?
Sir, We have no time to inquire about it!
If he leaves, this game ends here.
Sir, I'm waiting for your orders.
Get him.
Hey, teddy bear!
You want more?
Already gone.
A month's work for nothing.
That bastard...
Save the anger for him.
He'll tell us where the are goods.
The Bat must be
between top and bottom...
Or else, it won't hit the ball.
Nothing like this ever happened before.
I could have died...
How many times do I have to tell you?
This is serious!
This is serious!
This is serious!
serious!
Why are you so upset?
I'm the one who should be upset.
Because of this, I suffered a huge loss.
Make sure you find out the cause of this.
Nobody in Goa has ever dared
to do something like this.
Go to your
'Majesty' 'Majesty'.
Tell Mantu...
His days of hearing
'Majesty' 'Majesty', will end.
He'll be in jail.
You'll all go to jail soon.
Tell him...
His activities are coming to an end.
You lost my goods.
What do say about this, kevin?
Mantu will hire 'Sherlock Holmes'
to find the goods?
Is that it?
These are dirty, bring the others.
Unlucky gloves.
Kevin scored himself...
A 'self-goal'.
Mantu...
My men are searching...
Soon, they'll find the goods.
Mantu, my men...
are looking everywhere.
Mantu, we'll find the goods.
Listen, Kevin...
More than 10 million people in India
are using marijuana and drugs.
Drug market is very strong.
More than 1 million people
use heroin and brown sugar.
this information's in the
hands of the government.
So government knows that more than
1 million people use heroin and brown sugar!
Now...
The trade market is high.
I need those samples...
Without them...
How can i stay strong in this market?
3 days...
In just 3 days, the Russians
will come for those samples.
So you better find those samples.
Or I'll have you and your brother's
kidneys sold in the market.
Move it! Move!
Baldy!
Where did you put the heroin?
Where did you put the heroin?
Where's the heroin?
Still stoned.
I asked, where's the heroin?
Speak!
I did all the hard work,
so I want 50 percent.
It seems you want to die for it!
Don't be crazy.
You don't know who you're messing with!
You stole from Mantu.
Why doesn't he answer the phone?
Hello, brother...
Where are you?
Mantu beat you, eh?
It's good to think with a calm mind.
I see you're having fun,
while I'm in trouble here.
Easy, easy, brother.
I'm just having fun.
You're there, and I'm here.
Listen to me.
Before the waiter got whacked...
He said he smelled woman's perfume.
I checked all women.
Except 1 woman.
Anna!
The dancer girl?
Neat.
Look at our clothes...
You think we're Pickpockets?
Get out!
We have a problem.
What's up?
You've come to the wrong place.
Leave from here quietly.
But bro, we can't just leave!
Yesterday, Anna sold you a
camera that belongs to us.
We have to get back
that camera, you know?
There's an interest rate from 1 day to 15 days.
The article went up from 500 rupees to 5000 rupees...
payable to the person who pawned.
We don't know the rules...
Now what?
Now what?
Now what?
Now what?
Woman, talk to him!
Speak!
Go on...
Go on...
The camera's seller is with us...
Handsome.
So, say goodbye to the
500 or 5000 rupees...Bye!
Any other issue?
Well?
Your neighbor and her
daughter were abducted?
Are you sure?
- Yes.
Your neighbors were abducted, eh?
Ok, I'm sending an officer.
Address, please.
I need your address.
If you want to play games,
don't call us.
Two gangsters...
Couldn't handle one single man?
Luke...
You should have seen him...
He was like lightning...
Very fast!
He didn't flinch! When i shot fatso!
Twice!
Really?
You shoot to kill...
Despite the danger,
he fears nothing.
That's very nice.
We could use him as a decoy.
Don't hurt them.
I'll do as you say.
Tomorrow, you make a delivery for us...
Use our car, license plate
GA 05 JK 2309.
There's our new postman.
Open the glove compartment.
Take out a package.
Stop in front of the construction building ahead,
and ask for Mantu.
Deliver the package to him.
Now, destroy the phone.
And Naomi?
After delivery,
we hand them to you.
What's this, Aunty?
Tigers don't eat grass.
Why's there no fish?
And some tasty meat, and...
You want to eat fish or meat, pay more money.
Always asking for more meat.
Next time I'll pay more money.
Yes, speak!
The package!
Yes, Yes... Come in!
Did you came alone?
Yes, mantu!
Brave Russians!
Hey Russian!
You don't look like a Russian.
You look like an Indian man.
Put it here.
This came specially from Russia for you.
You'll love it.
Vodka from Russia.
Very tasty, Very tasty.
Drink, Drink!
Why won't you drink?
You don't like?
You think the drink's poisoned?
Let's toast!
You're Mantu?
What's this?
I was told to deliver this to you.
What's going on here?
You promised, where are they?
What?
Who are you working for?
There's your goods
Kevin!
Come on, hurry!
Mantu!
ANC!
You set me up, didn't you?
I had no choice.
I work hard, but you make the money.
No more.
From now on, I'll make the money.
I won't forgive you!
You'll swallow bullets!
Mantu, you bastard, Mantu.
You're finished!
This time, no minister will save you.
If you want to save yourself, you better run!
Mantu, you bastard.
You bastard, mantu!
Michael, give me that jacket.
Wait!
Throw him out!
Well, who is he?
We don't know who he is,
or where he's from, sir.
He doesn't seem to be connected to Mantu.
The dead woman's name?
Anna.
Any connection with Mantu?
I don't know.
All organs of her body are missing.
What do you mean 'All organs of her body'?
Meaning, kidney, liver, spleen tissues...
All that can be sold, has disappeared.
Mantu's into organ harvesting?
This wasn't his business.
I expect  Kunal's report.
Here sir...
This was in the flush tank of the toilet.
Half a gram, that's all?
I need more.
'Kabir Ahlawat' is the name
he used to register the pawn shop.
No police records on him,
and he didn't consume any drugs.
He registered the pawn shop in 2008.
But there's something strange.
What?
Before 2009, there are no records of him.
Like that, he doesn't exist.
Or all his records were deleted.
Search outside of Goa.
Everywhere, even if it's out of our jurisdiction.
Everything, narcotics cases, murder cases.
Look at her.
There's still blood in her veins.
Do you know what that means?
When her eyes were removed,
her heart was still beating.
She was still alive.
You better tell us something,
you're looking at lifetime imprisonment.
Maximum penalty.
Excuse me, sir.
Sir, I haven't eaten anything since morning.
Want me to order a sandwich?
Or you want a beating, instead?
Speak.
Why is there security
code-lock on your files?
What's wrong?
I can't access any of his files.
Here's Mantu's files, sir.
How nice...
A feast before going to prison.
Excuse me.
How can i eat with my hands tied?
Stomach's calling, friend?
Hey Vodka, he spoke.
Eat, eat...
Satisfy your hunger,
then talk.
Go on.
What a surprise!
Well...
Sir...
It's Fatso.
I've been thinking...
In the middle of all this,
where's Mantu?
Hello!
- Hello, Francis...
Who are you?
Russian translator.
I just asked for food.
Where's Francis?
Gave him the phone!
Why's everybody angry with me?
What did I do wrong?
7:35, he made the mistake
of releasing the handcuffs.
7:37.
7:39, 15 seconds.
Within 4 minutes he escaped with Mantu's file.
And sent the whole ANC to the hospital.
Francis's neck and teeth are broken.
Now, everybody in the ANC look the same.
Nasty guy, this 'Kabir Ahlawat'.
All files are encrypted by
RAW military intelligence.
RAW code on a civilian,
that's very strange.
Any solution to this problem?
There's one solution.
Do you remember a boy
sending an email, from hyderabad?...
...He was using the name 'Kabira Aloud'.
Now we'll want to look into this file.
We'll send it to the White House...
And their FBI will ask us to investigate...
We'll ask them for Kabir Ahlawat's file.
Message from 'kabira Aloud'
to the White House.
Should i Send it?
This could be trouble.
Go on, send it.
I didn't do anything.
It was Anna's idea.
She incited me.
Please, let me go.
We Indians...
Create a lot of problems.
That's bad!
What you say may be true.
Following a warning
In New Delhi...
About drugs,
and corruption...
We'll be facing problems.
So why don't you tell me the truth?
I'm telling the truth.
Just the two of us.
Me and Anna.
2 kg heroin...
You stole!
Nice!
I like!
And handsome?
What about him?
Who is handsome?
I'll count to three.
I don't know who he is.
I don't know who he is!
One!
Don't kill me!
I'm sorry!
Two.
Anna's idea... I'm Sorry.
Leave him.
Let's eat together.
You startled me!
You should have
warned me, brother.
Hey!
Get up!
This 'Handsome' worries me.
I wonder...
Why he didn't call the police?
Doesn't matter.
What's the difference?
The city of Goa is now ours.
Go there.
Where's Mom?
In there, go.
Please open the door!
Please, open the door!
Let me out, please!
Please open the door!
Found him, already?
No. Nothing on Mantu, either.
Hello!
I found him.
Age: in his thirties, and over 70 killings.
Amazing,
that he only broke their bones.
Because he usually kills everything.
Merciless assassin.
Trained killer.
INTERMISSION
Mantu!
You bastard, mantu.
You told me...
I had to recover
the heroin samples in 3 days.
If not, you would sell
our kidneys in the market.
But I carry out the
business of selling organs.
Kevin, you can take over all my business.
You can take all my money.
I can even give the
secret formula of the liquor.
With it, we can refine the Meth
and make trillions.
I'm sorry... Sorry! take all the money.
Money and...
Mathematics.
The last time,
you gave me a lecture about maths.
Yes, more than one million people
using marijuana and other drugs.
The government may
know more than me...
But let me tell you something.
More than 500 people a day
in this country, disappear without a trace.
Never to be found.
Only 10 of them passed my hands...
300 people a month...
Over 3,000 people a year...
Meaning approximately 7,000 kidneys.
Unit price would approximate 28 trillion over 4 million.
Skin tissues, spleen, liver, pancreas, remaining organs...
All worth money.
Mathematics.
That day, you were saying,
kevin do this, Kevin do that...
Kevin, you must do it.
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin...
When you hit my head,
it caused a short-circuit in my brain.
Then i understood.
The guy who was
hitting my head...
Could be worth money.
I'll take out your kidneys...
And sell them in the market.
I'll keep you alive...
And I'll tell you the price of them.
then I'll take out your eyes...
And sell them in the market.
I'll keep you alive...
Then I'll tell you the price.
Then we'll see...
Between you and me...
Whose mathematics is better...
Mantu...
You bastard, Mantu.
This is 'Kabir Ahlawat'.
Here's the information
from his file.
Raw military intelligence agent...
From 2000-2006,
He performed several...
successful covert operations.
And between the years 2006-2008...
He underwent special training.
Awarded military honors,
and RAW special commendation.
Look, here's the cash,
should i thank you?
He said he couldn't pay
the interest rates on his loan.
He underwent training...
Brutal training,
specializing in assassination, kidnapping.
How much can you pay?
Who's this?
You're mistaken.
We give loans,
we don't sell phones.
Talk, if you want to live.
You're a police officer?
The training was so brutal...
When the Secretary of Defense saw it...
He was shocked.
Sorry,
I'm in the phone business, too.
He comes here often,
buys 10 to 15 phones.
I heard he was in the
kidney sale business.
That's all i know.
According to the official reports...
He suffered a car accident in 2008.
Hospitalized for 'bullet wounds'.
Bullet wounds?
From a car accident?
Exactly. Not in a civil hospital,
but a military hospital.
And according to the military Sargent,
it was a car accident.
Accident, not so.
Is he even human?
Hello.
Where are you?
This isn't online shopping,
you're needed here.
Listen,
we might not get a second chance.
You come, okay?
Just come alone.
We have everything.
I give you the guy's location...
you'll pay my debt?
Just tell me where he is.
That's easy.
He entered,
and smashed everything.
What if he killed me?
And besides,
he attacked me with a knife.
Sir, he was here.
I got the location of the
organs trade, it's the 'City Club'.
First time here, eh?
Many hot ladies come here.
Indian, foreign.
But lately, police often raid the place.
Sometimes the police,
sometimes the ANC.
Makes me afraid
to come here, lately.
Zulia?
you checked the mail?
The postman arrived!
Go check the mail... he's here!
Kill him!
Boss!
- What?
The customer arrived.
Okay, I'm coming.
On my way.
I'm here.
At the moment, the bathroom's our office.
Are you married?
- Yes.
- We'll make you a romantic discount.
Why are you sweating?
Just tension.
No need to be tense.
Relax.
Bathroom.
You came with someone?
Yes.
Who?
A friend.
What friend?
Who's there?
You want something?
Sir, it's him.
He's the one.
Thank you.
I'll ask only once.
Where's Naomi?
Where is she?
Carla aunty.
- Who's carla aunty?
The girl was left with her.
Hey, shut up.
Today you surprised me, handsome.
Weren't you in jail?
Why did you kill naomi's mother?
You killed her.
You made the delivery.
Everybody thinks that.
You did the same to Naomi?
No.
Her organs are useless,
they aren't developed, yet.
So there's no market value, yet.
But her eyes...
Are worth a fortune.
You don't even imagine
how much those corneas are worth.
I Only demand a
small thing from you...
You go to jail for five years.
After five years, out of jail...
Maybe you'll find her alive.
You speak about tomorrow...
I don't live for tomorrow.
For me, there is no tomorrow.
I only live for today.
Just for today.
Even just for the moment.
And you made a big mistake.
You must be punished.
What?
What you did, will cost us dearly.
You're from Intelligence?
You violated classified information...
Lost the man and the drugs...
And now we're being followed by the CIA.
Give me the information about
Mantu, the files, and back off.
Are you kidding me?
Is there a problem?
You're interested in Mantu,
or Kabir Ahlawat?
I'll get both.
It's our case.
Our raid.
Six of our officers are in hospital.
We'll catch him.
Nobody will stand in our way.
You only know about this case.
You know nothing about Kabir.
Don't underestimate a wounded tiger.
That child withdrew 15,000 rupees.
From the savings account...
Of her mother's boyfriend.
It seems Kabir is looking for Naomi.
I just realized.
Tell me the truth.
He beat them all up.
The way he threw that knife...
Sir, sir, tell them I'm innocent.
Kabir Ahlawat...
My name is Dilip Sangokar.
You'll see me soon,
on the way to ANC Goa lockup.
Tell me something...
You're looking for Naomi, aren't you?
She's alive,
We have CCTV footage.
She withdrew money from an
ATM at a petrol pump station.
If you want to find her,
tell me what you know.
Kevin and Luke Pereira.
Forced me to
make a delivery to Mantu...
Using me as bait to trap him...
By threatening Naomi and her mother's life.
But they killed Anna.
That's all i know.
Luke and Kevin's dealer?
-Advin.
Get going, search the city for him.
The whole city?
Sure, the whole city, no problem.
Say goodbye to her.
Come.
You say goodbye to her.
Thank you, Naomi.
Behave, and you'll all be
back to your parents, soon.
Let's go.
If i behave like her,
you'll take me to my mother?
Why did you hit me, sir?
What's this, Adwin?
What's in it?
There's nothing in it.
We'll see.
There's nothing  here, sir.
Nothing, sir.
Behold, how the
Goa police treat people...
What?
What are you..
Get up...
Sir!
Go to the car.
Or I'll beat you here.
Come on, come on! Go!
Left! Right! Left!
I don't know anything about that, sir.
I just take care of the drug section.
Seen her?
I get it.
She's a Mungi.
- Mungi?
Mungi means bird.
They steal from tourists.
And sometimes they sell drugs.
Sir, their work is very simple.
They take a toy car from the toy store.
The toy car contains drugs.
They move around with these toys.
Police would not suspect of children.
Children are easy to maintain...
And they take care of all the work.
They carry the toys to the gaming zone...
That's where they deliver the toys.
Police won't check a gaming zone.
And then another child
will come for the package.
The package contains the drugs.
They hand the drugs package
to the other child.
The package is delivered to the third place.
There, the child receives shoes in a bag.
In fact, The customer's
credit cards are in those shoes.
The shoes are delivered
to the backdoor of the gaming zone.
They give the credit cards from the shoes...
To the child that brought the toy.
This child leaves, to meet with
another who is waiting...
The other takes the
credit cards to the ATM.
Then the client reports the
missing credit cards to the police station.
So there's no evidence that
this cash was withdrawn, sir.
Events Like the loss of
credit cards is a common problem.
So the police won't suspect anything.
The child passes near the police stations.
The police won't suspect the child.
You go there.
- Yes sir!
Hands up!
Hey, kid.
The child is acting.
Wake her up.
What are you looking at?
Back to work.
What happened?
Naomi brought here in an hour.
Who is this?
Who's voice is that?
You don't know the
voice of your brother?
Listen, if you do something to him...
Did you ever give a thought...
For the souls of these children?
Have you ever thought?
We give people...
a better life...
Those organs saving...
Sick patients?
we are...
Doing the right thing.
This is not right.
Apologize to them, before you die.
Why don't you talk?
Don't worry.
You're going home.
Where's Mom?
With God.
We sent her, from this ambulance.
Don't you want to see your mother?
Speak.
Say the address!
Where's the children?
where's the other children?
Sir, I don't know where they are.
We found the place.
What's your relationship
with the child?
You're ready to die for her?
Such a serious relationship,
is not good.
Her eyes.
As I said...
Worth a lot of money.
Want to see them?
Open it.
Perhaps she would like
to see the room?
I'll rip out all your body's organs.
There won't be nothing left to sell.
Hello, police...
Someone is trying to kill me.
Address? Forget address...
Track my phone for the address!
He's coming, coming!
The police are coming...
The police...
No, no, no...
Listen to me first.
Police will come...
Bang!
You want to shoot me?
Shoot me?
How you gonna kill me?
Bullet-proof car.
What can you do?
You can't do anything.
Nothing.
The police arrives,
police arrives, and I'll be saved.
And you'll be screwed.
What are you doing?
It's useless.
What are you doing?
Kunal...
Yes, sir.
Check inside, for more body's and anything else.
The doctor has no eyes.
Sir, most of them are dead.
Some could be taken
to the hospital, but the rest...
Do one thing...
Put the child in my car.
Officer?
May i make a final request?
What mess did you get yourself into, now?
That day, when you where with the police...
I'm sorry.
Now behold...
The whole police department
knows that i know you.
You can smile, handsome.
I discovered, today.
I'll be away for some time, ok?
Will you wait for me?
Will you hug me...
One last time?
