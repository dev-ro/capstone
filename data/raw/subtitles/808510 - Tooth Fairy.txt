There is an ongoing battle with
Both teams really go for it.
Now is the tie and the
Ice Wolfs are strong ...
And here they come!
What a blow.
- Come on, body to body!
Take them wide.
- It flies over the ice.
Go to the side.
- He shoots. Nice rescue.
What a blow.
They are crushed.
There is a recognizable tune.
The coach calls for the big defender,
Derek Thompson.
And here comes the tooth fairy!
Go towards it!
What a bear!
My tooth! My God, my tooth!
And the tooth fairy, Derek Thompson,
has struck again.
You can not tooth!
And that's the whole tooth and nothing else!
I pledge allegiance to the tooth.
Open the door for the tooth fairy.
Penalty Pause for number 14,
Derek Thompson. Fifteen minutes.
Who is the tooth fairy? I?
I am the tooth fairy!
Stop it. Stop.
I'm not afraid, I play hockey.
We have a good time ...
What's going on?
- Thompson, come here.
Meet our future.
- New kid.
He will not be long before
He is discovered by the Kings, but ...
while he is here, you must
protect him on the ice.
The rest does not matter.
Mick.
Derek Thompson, Mick Donnelly
Our First Line Server.
Donnelly, Thompson this is your bodyguard.
How you doing?
- Welcome to the hockey.
Was there a veteran game today?
I did not know you have played.
I was a big fan of yours.
Well, see you later.
Mr. Thompson!
Tooth fairy!
I get your autograph?
- Yes, of course.
What is your name?
- Gabe.
I am in my third team in the hockey league.
And my team won the championships.
Fantastic. Good for you.
- Once I play as high as you did.
You're doing a lot of hockey, huh?
- Yes, almost every day.
And I take him almost every day.
How old are you?
- Eight.
Okay, so you're eight.
And you're third after two others?
Almost nine.
Somewhere in this country is a 7-year
against which the 12-year record ...
and he makes them.
As if they are overflowing
Cambodian by a lion.
And so many children,
in each league.
And when the time is ripe, which will
children make.
Imagine reaching the NHL.
Probably not, but do so.
Set them out of your school ...
but they should not you
and before you can do something ...
you stand nowhere.
Lower your expectations.
So will you be happy.
Please.
I want to suck your blood.
What? What are you looking
and why are you laughing so?
Why are not you afraid?
- Because the chips are.
Can I not eat?
They are bad for vampires.
I'm going to die.
I have an idea.
- I can not talk.
Feel dead.
Mommy, my tooth came out.
Congratulations.
- The tooth fairy visits me tonight.
Let's see.
You're such a big girl.
I am the tooth fairy.
You were a vampire?
This is inconsistent mythology.
I have a lot of homework. Can I go?
Mama, it's time to go
Derek's done so the baby can make.
Not yet. You take your pajamas?
Would it help if you
a time dealing with Randy?
I'll do that.
If I am not alone with him.
Renee is here.
A little ketchup.
Tooth Fairy ...
- I got it.
Look, I have my pajamas.
- Dracula is back.
Chips, I love it!
What do you think of Donnelly?
- He is fast.
You mean the next Kruchky.
- I love him already as a long lost brother.
Can we just play?
- Part.
I have some money shortage,
but this signature ...
says the tooth fairy.
Ten dollars each,
so this one is $ 100. I'm in..
You really should pay.
- I agree.
I insist guarantee.
I'll be back.
- He took his card.
Seriously?
- Only so we can play.
Do not take the kids or something?
I'm home.
- Hi, honey.
Hey guys.
What juice?
- We have just juice.
I'm a little tired.
Mama, mama!
What is it, dear?
- My tooth is gone.
The tooth fairy took him.
But there is no money.
I looked al
Let's look,
it will be stored somewhere.
The vampire is back!
- No time vampire.
It is neither.
She went down first and see what
your tooth is worth for the money they bring.
Right, Derek?
- How it works.
No, it does not.
You put your tooth under your pillow ...
flies in the tooth fairy,
takes the tooth and leave behind one U.S. dollars.
Where is it?
Tell me if the tooth fairy
been, because I have 5, 10 ...
You're a big girl now, so
We solve this so on ...
there is no ...
Here it is.
- How was it there?
You have it in your sleep
have thrown on the ground.
I forgot.
And then tell them
that the tooth fairy is not real?
There are so many people unhappy
because they stick to 'what if'.
So dreaming is bad?
Yet when they go to unrealistic
expectations rise.
This is ridiculous.
- I know.
I go to bed.
... You're away.
Word is not dramatic.
- I? I say stop when her fantasies.
What?
Belief in one fee.
Subpoena.
What?
Thompson, Derek Thompson?
- Yes, God, I am.
Are you God?
- Are you Thompson?
Are you God?
- No, your social worker Tracy.
What is this?
How disappointing.
- Come on, please.
No thanks. Very elegant.
But what is?
- No idea.
But what is?
- Who is this guy?
Slayer dreams, illuminates your soul.
What have I done? Why am I here?
Where am I?
Nobody likes you here,
or your attitude ...
The way you come,
"Why here? What are those big wings? ".
Do we have a problem?
- Yes, because you just said.
Tracy is it, right?
What a beautiful girl.
Do not laugh, that's not funny.
This is strike 2, strike 3 you will not.
- What happens after 3?
Strike 4.
We care for you so uniform,
you register and then your training.
Training for what?
- You, Mr. Thompson ...
will spend time as a tooth fairy.
A tooth fairy ...
Excuse me.
Quiet everyone, he is harmless.
All right?
- Really, a fairy waiting?
100 kg man because you have more than
8 fairies for that. Hands off.
This is very elegant.
Where were we?
- Help, please! I'm in a nightmare!
Please, help me!
- The nightmare starts.
Do you attempt to the title?
Feeling lucky?
Perhaps. Hold it down.
I see nothing. Give them back,
not a good idea.
You want a piece of?
Ready to start.
You have just one big mistake.
He has a magic wand.
Buy a rabbit from a hat.
Fairies fight!
Give it to him.
- Now I have one too.
In just imagine the hammer.
Sladge Brothers and Jack. Who do you want?
Fantastic.
You've chosen the wrong fee.
Magic wand.
Good Lord.
I've broken him.
What's going on?
I'll tell you.
- He keeps talking.
He talked about the Hammer brothers.
They are still in town.
Stop it!
You behave like gnomes.
He has a bad behavior.
- I know his behavior is good enough.
Hello, Mr. Thompson.
- Hi.
Sorry for your uniform.
Budget problems.
Tracy will it.
- He, sure.
You're guilty
spread of unbelief.
Dreams kill, commit
first-degree murder of fantasy ...
what with ...
- Is that because ...
I have not done talking.
Seemed that so?
No idea, everyone here has a British accent.
- You interrupted me again.
Do I not effective enough?
I understand why officers or firefighters
Men are not interrupted, but ...
by a pair of wings
fly all the way out the door.
Would not you have more respect
for someone with wings or without wings?
You have no idea which I
am responsible.
I can fly out and do something crazy.
Maybe I spit fire.
You do not know.
Sorry I interrupted.
That's better. Your debt
payable to humanity ...
you're ordered to spend time
as a tooth fairy.
Standard Punishment is one weeks.
But because you have the guts ...
your really the tooth fairy to as ...
and thus to mock everything
we face ...
I rebuke you for two weeks.
No, no. That is unfair.
Pause.
- Again, unbelievable.
Take him away. Make him
the correct uniform will ...
and bring him to the flying lessons.
- What?
First you must meet Jerry.
Excuse me, moederfee.
I have one last question.
Leave this hole is my tutu look fat?
Yes, huge.
Disgraceful.
Well.
- Okay, you have the male version.
Turn around for once.
- I give you a twist on your nose.
What does that mean?
- A threat.
It seems that you will do so.
- No, I turn on your nose.
That is clearer.
- What is that?
Pathetic, just a child.
Chicken is fine.
I hate not chicken.
I think the chicken well.
I hate your chest piece.
I come, goodbye.
Wedding never a gnome.
The dream killer.
It felt good to lie to the child?
I have not done.
- You said there was no tooth fairy.
Exactly.
- Liar.
Sorry.
- That is a start.
For a fee to be
you ready.
However ...
there is a pill. A great pill.
If you take the pill ...
none of those things you do.
- Really?
No, but I joke.
I gave you something and weather stripped.
'm Just mad at me.
I do not care.
Walking with Jerry.
Here is your Belt. Waterproof,
many boxes.
You get in much.
This.
This is your wand. A 'teeth detector
radio communications.
The radio remains Galiente pick.
No idea why.
What is that?
- Magic Button generator.
It does what you want,
but you must believe in it.
So it is useless for people.
And this.
This means you never lose.
- What is it?
It looks like an iPod adapter.
- What is it?
An iPod adapter.
- What is it?
To listen to your iPod.
Asked you not to free your iPod?
No. Really?
- But I joke.
Why do you do that.
- I am sick, I do not live long.
Are you serious?
- Of course not.
I known you, why would I tell?
And you lie to children.
We have work to do.
Spray invisibility.
Only then you see other fairies.
And this, believe me dude ...
paste shrinkage. Do something on your tongue,
and you shrink to ten inches high.
Would you do it? Together, come on.
We jump into each other's hands.
I would not jump into your hand.
- Let us be small.
Sometimes when I get home,
I take double portion ...
my feet dangling over the inkwell.
When she sleeps, I walk over her body ...
when they wake up are everywhere
foot steps.
She says, what is this?
I have no idea.
As long you're married,
you do such things.
Let's see what else.
A cookie? Self Made.
Taste it, come on.
Very tasty.
Come test them.
They are very good.
They are good ...
Dogs bark, very handy.
- What?
Cats, postmen, dogs or ...
if a child is chasing you
you've lied to.
How often should I have to say sorry?
- Six times.
Sorry, sorry, sorry ...
- Sorry, but I joke.
That you believe. Have your years
played without a helmet or something?
Your brain looks like pudding.
And you have shark eyes.
Like death.
Katverdwijner, very important
if you're not katpersoon.
I have something wonderful.
Not moving.
My greatest invention ever.
Powder memory. You throw some and
the child forgets the past 2 seconds.
Of course, come on.
How it works.
- So what works?
Powder memory. You throw some and
the child forgets the past 2 seconds.
How it works.
- So what works?
Powder memory. You throw some and
the child forgets the past 2 seconds.
How it works.
- So what works?
Never boring.
To fly, you must believe.
You must learn to use your wings.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound.
Who is your hobbit friend over there?
You stay here, okay.
You must learn from the best.
Someone stamped
this guy as the best.
And I will not fly. I've fixed
the one bad wing hockey.
That excuse I have ever heard.
- We do it.
Temporary He-man and Peterpan.
- Let me start.
Is that your motivation secrets fairies?
I said I have a bad wing.
Put me down!
- Great, huh.
I put this harder.
- Put me down.
We can test the VOA.
What is that?
Vliegen, Obstruction, Removal.
I throw you something and dodges.
That you should not do.
Do you want to throw one?
You take your responsibility
not, and you eludes them.
Come on!
- Wimbledon!
That is low.
Light me your arm and repeat.
I ... fill in your name.
I, Derek Thompson ...
- Swear approval and performance ...
Swear approval and performance ...
of accountability and commitment ...
of a tooth fairy.
... of a tooth fairy.
of a tooth fairy.
- And I do not drink and fly.
Do not drink and fly?
Okay, that's sincere.
That I will not drink and fly.
- Welcome aboard.
These are useful in the shop.
- Maybe for a sticker.
It is really, fairies exist.
- Too late, your punishment starts tomorrow.
No, no.
This delay should be similar,
Jerry as his work.
I can do very well.
My coach is sitting on my neck and ...
I must make it up with my girlfriend.
I pause again. Sorry.
- Any task that you miss an additional week.
If you fail, or anyone else says
you're a tooth fairy ...
time is extended indefinitely.
- I am not leaving.
Goodbye, Mr. Thompson.
- No.
Sorry.
Why?
What I said last night.
Which part?
Every part that I have offended you.
For everything I ever said.
Or have thought.
Even before I met you.
Want to come.
- Oh yes.
Spend some time with Randy alone.
Yes. Let me get something out of my car.
I'll be back.
Me and Randy.
I never knew you could.
- What do you want?
A gift, can you guess what it is?
- Is it a puppy?
Wag, no puppy.
One of my hockey sticks.
And once I've signed ...
with the tooth fairy ...
is very valuable.
I let it stand here.
You get down that many girls with guitars.
- Stop us now?
You're just like the previous
friends of my mom ...
They pretend they are nice to
impression on her.
No, I'm much better looking
than her previous boyfriends.
Fist because we broke the ice.
No, it disappears.
Come to my home. I get my
drum up you and your guitar ...
we play together and jam.
If I tell you mama
are actually pretty cool ...
and you leave me alone.
- Agreed.
You will not believe what you said about Randy.
That you are pretty cool.
- Me too.
Whatever you do, it works.
So keep that filled.
CALL ME, T.
Who is't?
- No idea.
I know that you must close your eyes.
I have a surprise.
Really?
Close your eyes.
My surprise is 1 meter 90,
with dark brown eyes?
So that you discover.
- I love surprises.
Be ready.
I know that for me is.
- Keep your eyes closed.
Well.
Everything is fine.
Do not look.
I needed fresh air.
I'm no good.
Should I come ...

Go inside and grab the tooth.
No, I do nothing. You do it.

It succeeds at nothing.
You're a fairy.
But with no wings.

So you're not good enough?
They put you behind a desk.

Stuff. The magic powder.
Stuff. Q. Tell
No more stuff.
- That's great.
Even a half week of my job,
how should I do?
Sorry, we have very little money.
Would you like to know why?
- Not really.
Because children no longer believe
as they did.
We are not alone.
Also Unicorns, gnomes, dragons.
All these departments.
Disappeared.
If this trend continues, then there
tandfeÃ«enland soon no more.
No child will ever visit
received from the tooth fairy.
Ever.
- No more visits from the tooth fairy.
So what?
You really can not understand.
You do not understand that the fantasies
of the children ...
their ability to imagine something,
that important?
Thus ignore their souls.
It is the foundation that allows them
to dream.
Dreams are bad.
Useless.
You're done.
- The whole week?
For tonight. Unless you want
remain "Fairioke.
Oh. No.

Little Drummer Boy.
Who are you?
- Ziggy.
Say what you want.
Zigman, Zigmeister ...
Stop talking.
- They want you to fail.
What?
- Think about it.
If you fail, they get more time.
It's like credit card debt ...
they simply want you forever
pay.
Yes.
- Do you really play that game?
$ 1000.
- $ 1000?
You kill me.
- How do you like that ending?
Can I check?
Oh dear.
Can you see me?
This does not work.
- What is that?
What are you doing?
What Ziggy has given me?
Stay calm.
- 112?
I only needed the tooth.
- There is an alien on my balcony.
You're amazing.
Lily has so pissed because a Fairy
had to send your messes.
I've learned my lesson.
Never buy black market stuff.
I can not even 2 weeks continue.
- Yes, you can be friend.
You just have to a greater power
vomiting. It simultaneously take one days.
Social workers decide who our
can see and who not.
You would know if you ever focus on
I would listen to me or donated.
But no.
Shut up.
- Friend ...
You should really take refurbishing.
If you want I can give you a pamphlet.
- Your punishment is also extended.
You have to have one weeks.
Well done.
Great. Just what I need.
- I think you need it, friend.
I can now give new stock.
On one condition. From now on follow
rules. You embrace the fairy spirit.
And then listen again.
- Good. I will ever be the best tooth.
You always pull you back from me and then ...
you never call. And when I finally
anything you hear ...
is that your deposit to pay.
What happened to you on?
I want to tell you,
but I can not.
Why not?
That I just can not.
I know what it is.
This is you that you withdraw.
You're afraid of a commitment to enter.
You're nervous because it seriously.
Yes, that's it.
You know me so well.
I am nervous about how serious it is.
- What?
You're a woman, and frankly,
You would not understand.
What?
I'm not nervous because it seriously
between us. I must not even think.
What?
I was a little upset.
And I love you so much.
I'm afraid to ruin
and for you to lose.
I understand. I'm so glad you
weather is good.
Can I get some of that?
What are you doing? Have you already started training?
- I'm coming.
Hurry.
It is to me stood, flushed,
bitten and arrested.
Stop complaining. You promised
embracing the spirit fairies.
I really embrace the spirit fairies.
But I do it ...
on my way.
That is outside the rules.
- Yes.
I'm just here for the tooth.
Only the tooth.
I take my glove off.
Good.
Now enter the tooth.
Calm down.
Let it go.
I said, 'let loose'.
Very good.
Good evening.
Who are you?
I am the tooth fairy.
Yes.
All right? Ok.
Mick, how you doing so far with you?
I'm the new player
and ...
some teeth of the Wolf
are long, if you understand me.
This reference, Derek Thompson,
the tooth fairy?
No, I respect my parents.
Thompson takes you under your wing?
- No, its wings are rubbish ...
mine are new and ready to fly.
I want my own thing.
A confident young player, good luck.
- Thanks.
The Ice Wolf make them simple.
Mick, you are.
- Finally.
Good luck, kid.
I mean it. I think you great
does. You are the best hockey player ever.
Whatever.
Come on.
Donnelly joins the game,
and going right past.
The Ice Wolfs go past the blue line.
Haig is on the network. These two rivals
go some blows with each other.
Here we go.
The PUK is in the corner.
Donnelly goes after him.
What happened to Donnelly, Jim?
- What are you doing?
The PUK is extracted from the
Donnelly and arrested him.
Save him!
He is terrible.
What happened there, Jim?
Has anyone beaten him, Jim?
What is going on?
He laughs?
Is everything okay?
What?
Try to test me?
- Get off the ice off.
If you want to play games
go sit on the bench.
But on Thurs. Hurry.
What did I miss?
Why do you bark?
I'm not ready.
I ruined it just now.
It's okay.
We must continue to practice.
Everyone laughed at me.
Maybe I should not do.
Perhaps they do, or ...
you might blow the roof off.
You can not score if you do not shoot.
Yes? When did you
The last shot?
When I started, I was
a scorer.
First Round, 'The Devils' ass.
In 'The Bigs' played.
What happened?
- I broke my shoulder in Chicago.
They have put me a grade lower
to recover, and it lasted forever.
I was so angry and frustrated that I a
New Heaven evening someone took to grazing.
Hit a few of his teeth out,
The audience was crazy ...
and when they called me 'the tooth fairy.
And that's stayed with me.
And I have not scored for years.
But I have more penalty minutes
than anyone else in the league.
If you are not completely healed or shoulder?
It is not the same.
- How do you know?
You try not agree.
You can not score if you do not shoot.
If you do, I'll do it.
Well adopted.
And a tooth.
That must have been a good time,
when you handed the tooth.
I am interested how it felt.
- Find it out yourself.
I'm not a fairy with wings.
Put it out again.
Why can not you have wings?
Do you know anything about fairies evolution?
Who wrote that?
"Charles Darwing?
The fairies growing trend in some
fairy wings on, and some not.
I am one of the unfortunate.
- Tooth fairy if you do not have wings.
You have it all.
- That's true.
You must show them your power.
Speed, masculinity, flexibility.
How do I do?
To pawns around.
No, come back.
Where you going?
- Check that gate again.
That is almost one meters high,
You're almost 2 meter long ...
go back.
A dinosaur!
- No.
I am again.
- Is everything okay?
Why save the child?
Back to my roots, that
is my worst nightmare.
It succeeds al
You look like a beautiful Reindeer
so with your legs. You dance.
Not with the child, to yourself.
Powder memory.
That sounded great.
You make them off tomorrow.
What do you think?
Nice.
Great. Randy Harris.
Talent Show. I think the action is fun.
Do you think I am a famous rock star can
become. Like Clapton, Hendrix, or Stevie Revon?
Fair?
- Yes.
You're pretty good.
Let's say you are very hard
to continue working.
Let us say that your the best
13jarige guitar player of the neighborhood is.
It is so. You should know that
a lot of neighborhoods.
And a lot 13jarige guitar players, but
somewhere out there a 12jarige ...
that kills the guitar.
You know what?
Yes, that's possible.
Take them to graze.
In the third part of the game
was 43 for the Arrows ...
and this is another great game.
The Arrows represent
and get away.
You're turn.
- You clean your pants on?
It's okay.
You'll even lick them.
The Ice Wolfs push the PUK on the Arrow's half,
Lion and are chasing.
The coach leaves Donnelly back into play.
Now they have the puck
got behind the blue line.
And here comes the bank of Thompson,
and replaces Dobs.
Thompson fits Browley and takes him over.
Thompson goes back in the game
while Donnelly is on the side.
Thompson takes the puck to the stick,
Donnelly and go with him.
It is two against one with Thompson
who takes the lead.
Donnelly shouts that he should give off.
Thompson appears to fit
he makes the pass,
He has the goal left wide open,
the goal is open.
What does he do?
The Arrows are on the ice, they shoot
and scoring.
Jim, it seemed Thompson wanted to shoot
and he just suffocated.
You're not a hockey player, but
an example assertion attraction.
Look at the game tomorrow
from the bank.
Asshole.
Come on, guys.
Great.
How was your race?
Not good.
- Dad, I have another loose tooth.
Great, baby.
- What?
Everything. Nothing. Forget it.
- Can we go practice?
Can we skip the lesson today.
It just does not succeed with.
The talent show is tomorrow night.
- I can you.
I must have at least one time through.
- You do not.
I did do need. I need some more
practice so I can win.
No matter what you are doing
the talent show ...
You will never be a famous rock star.
Only one other child with a guitar.
Do yourself a favor and give up. It is
for his own good. Trust me.
Come on, Tess.
- What happened to you on?
I had a bad day?
- A bad day?
A bad day, right?
- No, that's not good.
You never talk with my children.
It's over between us. "
You know what your problem is?
You can not say, 'what if'.
And that will never be.
Who wants to hear good news?
Me. Come on.
Why are you here?
- Lily has given me this.
Fairies Teachers Proof.
- It's only a proof, but I am on my way.
You should now be on my way home,
because I go to bed.
It's all thanks to you.
We should celebrate.
I know a place where all beautiful
fairies mothers.
Are you crazy? I like everything
lost what is important to me.
My friend, the children ...
and probably have my skates
forever hung on the willow.
Just because I like an idiot
in the tooth fairy crap you believe.
And look where I
brought.
Your attempts after all these years, that works
not and then simply pass on?
So it would not be easy.
And you know it.
I'll tell you what I know.
I know you do not have wings.
This means that you not fly.
This also means that you never
a tooth can be.
And what happens if you out a building
ten floors to escape?
I will tell you. Flat!
So.
You know what really sad?
Those who have hurt you the most
with all of your dreams is not murder ...
Carly or randy, or I,
that's yourself.
Go away. Well.
Fine.
I go to bed.
A 24 minutes into the third half.
The Ice Wolf still 1 to 0.
And Derek Thompson is still
coach in the dugout.
I think he has the whole game
the ice has not yet seen.
Come on.
- While the game goes ...
Andreas Patrinkle replaces, the newcomer,
Thompson continues.
What's this?
Another blow.
Donnelly picked up along the PUK.
He goes across.
He plans to return.
Donnelly makes every move
goes just right.
Donnelly going off, and becomes
almost out of position and Donnelly's going along.
He will shoot. And he ...
Against the bar.
Rick, what happened?
He blew his whistle.
Outside picture was beaten down Patrinkle
and I think he does not stand up.
Thompson, go there.
Go.
Come on, guys.
- The Ice Wolf have 1 minutes ...
to score, otherwise
an extension.
Thompson looks at the clock.
And while they start to chase
the clock counting down.
It seems that Thompson takes part
because he must.
Thompson got a shot.
How can that no penalty be?
He was beaten upside.
I think the tooth fairy a cookie
own got dough.
Look for Thompson, Jim.
His legs seem to get back on track.
Thompson flies over the ice, and I
do not make friends.
This is gonna hurt.
No, he meant, he did not hit.
Unbelievable.
He takes the puck off and flies over the ice.
Thompson makes movements that we
have not seen.
Who is that guy.
It is only through
a defender.
He becomes the defender, I think
he will fall.
No, he remains strong,
lets see what that guy.
He shoots.
Derek Thompson has nine years
no more shooting ...
and if I have a great shot
never seen. With one arm.
Tommy the mayor of Ville Shock
let's do it again.
Not bad.
Great shot, dude.
Here we go.
Even 20 seconds, while both teams
go to the center spot.
Oh, no.
The Ice Wolfs have the puck, and
a pass to Thompson ...
Who give away.
- Why would he do that, Nick?
I have no idea, Jim.
- I can not abandon them.
This is my last chance to
the game play.
To leave as I came.
- From what I've seen, you earn it.
Thompson, what are you doing?
Are you not a student?
You break the rules or not?
Please, I've learned from the best.
Look here first to address ...
Before making the decision.
This is Carly's house.
- 14, come on.
Thompson, go back into the field.
I can go.
Lily does not know.
But I will know.
I need this for home care.
Let's do this.
- How? You can not fly?
Good time to learn.
Yes, that is.
Take them to graze.
If you want to fly,
you believe.
No panic, but it is a huge
memory gun.
It does not hurt and you feel
nothing.
Remember me.
That you do.
Good luck with your car find.
Hi, honey.
- Hi, Derek.
You have a nice costume.
I must tell you something.
I was wrong, the tooth fairy
really exists.
And that's me.
I mean not the hockey.
I am the real tooth fairy.
- No, you're not.
"You're the real tooth fairy.
- Did our secret, okay?
Randy.
What are you doing here?
I need to talk to you.
Go away.
- Listen ...
I was wrong,
what I said yesterday.
I do not care.
- You must continue to play guitar.
You have real talent.
And something you love
is never a waste of time.
I'm so sorry.
Even if I wanted,
still can not.
I've destroyed my guitar,
remember?
So no talent show.
Hold on.
Maybe this helps?
That's great!
How did you do that?
- Magic generator for all purposes.
What clothes do you?
There you'll find out.
And now for the clothes and talent show.
Come on.
Derek.
Mama! Derek is the tooth fairy.
You've rented a fairy costume
order to make up with Tess.
Yes.
That's what I did.
Derek is giving me a new guitar,
and brings me to the talent show.
What time is it?
That you never get.
Do not worry about,
we'll make it on time.
You that way. And you get dressed
we see you there.
Oh yes.
Where is your car?
- No car, ahead.
Hold on.
How is this possible?
- It is good.
How is this possible?
On a certain night,
I found a call under my pillow.
What is a call?
This is an invitation,
feÃ«enland going to go.
Fairy Land?
- Yeah, I got these wings.
I have met someone who called Tracy.
He looks like a tooth fireman,
but with the eyes of a tuna.
Besides, I can myself
to shrink three inches.
Will we again?
What is it?
Sorry buddy, but I
enough rules.
Randy, there you are. I searched everywhere.
You're turn.
Quickly inside and get ready.
Another tooth.
- Thank you.
You are welcome.
Now I go to a concert.
You best have some complications
Mr. Thompson.
But I've helped Carly
Randy and then ...
Tess and has only six,
So who will soon forget.
And even if they do not forget,
they will now at least ...
will always ...
- Always what?
They will always have faith.
Like me.
I get it now, dreams are good.
For everyone.
Mr. Thompson ...
I hereby relieve you
service of the tooth fairy.
You're good.
- She is a pro.
Congratulations.
Stop it that way.
I would prefer no physical contact.
You will find me fun.
I know you likes me.
You do now very distant,
I understand that ...
but somewhere in there,
do you like me.
Not doing so frisky.
I must really go.
- Can you still wait?
Tracy, I must also
talk to you.
What is this about?
- Anyone who can restore Mr. Thompson ...
deserves this more than anyone.
Are those ...?
- Those are your wings, Tracy.
Wear them with pride,
every time you retrieve a tooth.
You're a tooth, buddy.
- I have my wings.
You have your wings.
Look, that you need fixed.
I just do not know
why I love talking.
Thank you, Lady.
This is all wonderful
and I am very proud of you ...
you're the biggest tooth fairy world,
but I really gotta go.
Someone should help me down here.
Tracy, will you do it,
or should I do?
A gift?
I'm afraid not.
You will not remember you later
what happened here.
Why?
Because we always already
that way.
I will never forget.
I still can not believe
you came into the game.
That is as it is here.
Thank you, Tracy.
For everything.
You big giraffe with your four eyes.
Back to the zoo.
And you and head back to Easter Island.
Brothers are still in the city.
Let me once again meet those guys.
You're my man.

We would meet best e-mail.
