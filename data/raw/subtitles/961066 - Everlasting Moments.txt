The week after my mom met my dad
she won a camera on the lottery,
Dad thought that the camera should
be his because be paid for the ticket,
Mom said that to get a part of the
reward he'd have to marry her.
And so they did.
Maria Larsson's Eternal Moments
My moms name was Maria, my dads was
Sigfrid, but he went by Sigge.
And they named me Maja.
-Should we play, Maja?
-Not today, Mrs. Ost is coming.
-She's coming here?
-To us.
Mrs. Ost was my teacher.
That she was visiting was
more than I could dream of.
-Such beautiful craft.
-Dad made it.
-What a great dad Maja has.
-My man was at sea once.
-There you go.
-Thank you so much.
-Here's a book Maja can borrow.
-Thank you, Mrs. Ost.
-Maja told me you've been reading.
-"Unkle Tom's Cabin".

Excuse me.
Dear Lord.
Come Stina, Stina come
Come to dad
Come to daddy, come to daddy,
Come! Oh come to daddy!
-No Let het go.
-Come, come, com...
Let go! Let go!
God's light shall not forget him
And the sun can't hide
Forgotten
There, now you each have a picture
of the old King, as a memory.
Here we have our old King Oskar.
I loved school more than
anything else.
Mrs. Ost was both nice and smart
and just strict enough.
I dreamed about being a teacher.
Anyone has any questions?
Maja!
Did King Oskar hit his
princes and princesses?
King Oskar only had princes, Maja.
But if he had little princesses-
-and they did something that
made them deserve it...
Yes, then I think they'll get a 
bit of spanking by the King.
It was always uncertain times
for work in the docks.
Dad was strong like a bear, so he
usually managed to find something.
Assholes! You think you can do
whatever you want to with us?

Not even a drop.
The backyards were full of children
and the houses were old
At the toilet we always stomped our
feet to scare the rats.
But mom kept the house clean. She
said "you see what you want to see".
Moms pride was her old sewing machine.
It had taken her a while to pay it off.
She could sow anything. She took
50 pennies for pants with zipper.
-Should I sow a coat as well?
-No, I don't think so.
It's never as clean as when
Maria was with us.
-Isn't she going to come back?
-I have the children.
Ah yes. Maria has a daughter
who is old enough to work?
Maja... Maja is still in school.
Let me know when she is old 
enough. The sooner the better.
Sigfrid Larsson...
Drunk in a public space again.
Almost everyone we knew were
members in the sobriety group.
But every time dad broke his
promise, we were kicked out.
After a while we could come back
in, until we got kicked out again.

Are you on the right path now?
Is it nice?
-Si...
-Signe.
-Why does it say Signe?
-Yeah, they misspelled Maria.
Ah they spelt it wrong.
- Ville, the accordion.
Here, dad.
But down to the ship Hulda
that was the ships name
A drunk sailor slinks
through his girls arms.
With tears on the cheek.
The lodge had two passwords:
freedom och reckoning.
-If you didn't know, you didn't in.
-Reckoning

The password should be secret...

-Good day mom.
-Oh Sigge!
Grandma loved dad,
but we didn't love her.
-Good day little Maria.
-Good day old lady.
-Say hello to grandma now.
-Good day.
In the forest there was a house
It was the home of need
Thou father of the house was
a drinker
It was a cold and bitter night
And the man has gone
In the home there is no bread
And the fire has gone out
Tell me, my friend who listens.
Tell me, you want more?
A drink that life and health take
And wrecks house and home
Tear down satans yard
And don't be a slave to thee
Let the glass be empty, for Jesus
And everything will be fine
No one could dance like my dad.
Mom said he could've had anyone,
but he had chosen her.

Tonight I was proud over you, Sigge
Now, promise me...
No more!
-No more alcohol!
-Yes, damnit!
I'm sorry...

-Stockholmer, take a shot!
-No thank you.
"When I for a week left the
watchman"-
-"my opinion of socialism had
taken form. I was an anarchist".
-Anarchist.
-Here, Sigge. Read this.
Uh huh.
"The Socialistic Youth Party...".
-Are you leaving when I get there?
-Where else are we gonna get money?
You shouldn't clean the house of
those damn capitalist swines.
-Where have you learned such words?
-"Such words", I mean what I say.
Where's Ville?
Kalle came home, all blooded up.
-And with wet pants as well.
-Kalle started it.
-Give the boy a real spanking!
-I raise my children, not some hag!
-Did you do it?
-Kalle started it.
I said, did you do it?
Kalle was talking crap about dad.
Kalle said that dad was a drunk.
Ville just tried to protect dad.
-Maja didn't do anything, stop it!
-No one ever died from a little beating.
Hello!
Do you want a drink?
-Mom...
-Hello!
Shut up, you damn Finn!
Let my children sing.
No, that's enough!
What a hell.
Are people not allowed to have fun?
-So an angel watches over the children.
-Let the children sing for the captain.
This is nice kids, it's nice.
- What a hell are you talking about?

What is he saying?
What's this fuzz about?


No, what a hell are you doing?
You damn Finn...
Stop! Stop!
Stop!
No...
Stop!
Take a caramel here, and then go
look at the birds.

It's canary birds.
All men are bastards, you know
that right?
You can't move here with your kids
just because your husband is being mean
Dad...
It's Sigge.
I can't stay with him anymore.
He promises he'll sober up,
but he always breaks his promises.
-Can dad help with money?
-Think, Maria,,,
What God has planned for us,
no one knows...
-He hits me and the children.
-You shall stay with Sigrid.
Until you die.
No man shall break what was
sealed with God.
Leave now, I'm going home.
Home?
To Kristina,
Dad, moms dead.
Yes.
-Drop it, God damnit!
-It's a strike, damnit.
This is how it is, yes Maria,
now you have the old man at home all day.
It's a strike, now the riches
will know what we are worth.
What we are worth!
What are we worth without money?!
I'm not allowed to clean anymore,
and I sow all night long.
No more cleaning the riches,
soon we'll be rich.
Here you someone who is fast and
hot like burning coal.
-No, not now! Sigge!
-Have me in the sauna? Come on!
-No, let me go!
-Easy, easy...
-Stop!
-Oh no...




Leo, no.
Come here Leo!
Get out! -
Sorry, he's just a puppy.
Yes this camera,
is there any use for it?
-Use?
-I've had it for so long.
-I don't know if it's any good.
-Well, let's see.
Yes...
Oh it's a beauty.
It is a Contessa,
-Is there any film in it?
-Film?
-Oh yes.
-Is it worth anything?
-You want to sell it?
-Yes
-What is it worth?
-I'm not sure...
It's a beautiful camera, but...
Leave it here a couple of days
and I'll get you a price.
Yes, yes, okay then.
Aren't you leaving a name?
-A name?
-So I know who it belongs to.
Yes! Yes, Larsson,
Mrs. Larsson... sounds like 
you're not from the country.
No, I was born in Finland,
in Raivola.
Pedersen is the name.
I'm from Denmark. Odense.
-No, you should keep it.
-Yes?
-Thank you.
-Welcome back.
Mrs. Larsson!
Piff, paff, puff!
Come back tomorrow and I'll give you
a price and I'll show you the film.
Go home!
-Go home till England!
-Go home! Go home!
Dad didn't care too much about
politics,
But he couldn't stomach letting the
English doing his work.


Damn England!
-Here you'll see Mrs. Larsson.
-Oh no, that's what I look like?
The picture is a bit torn up
because the film was old.
I don't understand how it works.
Ah...
Can I have Mrs. Larsson's hand?
Here you go.
Look!
There!
A miracle.
Hold it.
Don't tell me you're going to sell this
great camera without trying it out.
If you have five minutes, I'll show
you how to use it.
-Good luck.
-Thank you.
You have to sit completely still.
And remember, not a word about this
to anyone. Anyone!
-It's our little secret.
-What about dad?
No, especially not dad.
A miracle.
...and three loaded packets
And the red light.
-Mr. Grevelius, Mrs. Larsson,
-Good day.
And developer and films.
I can't take this, I don't
have any money.
You've got the camera that I'm
going to buy. I'll pawn it.
-Yes but...
-You can use it.
And then I'll deduct the material
from the price of the camera.
Oh?
Yes.

It's going to get nasty if we
don't accept these conditions.
-Here you go.
-Not going to let them get any ideas!
-We'll have to hit back.
-Of course, we'll hit back.
-Don't you know who Kropotkin is?
-No, I don't.
The anarchist that wrote this book.
And this...
No...
Here...
Here...
There are those fucking cunts
laying around.
One should put a dynamite in
their assholes.
Good thing not all of you strike.
You're awful, get up there.
You must not have gotten
anything in a while.
What a hell...
-What is it?
-Heck I don't know.
-What have they done?
-No idea.
What a hell is wrong with you?
But... it is him.
Where have you been?
It's the strike.
The entire night?!
Tonight, big things has happened.
I'll tell, things has happened.
Big things.
Really? You smell like perfume.
No perfume, it's dynamite!
I smell dynamite, perfume?!
Workers don't rat out.
Period.
-but 1 000 crowns... someone will.
-No!
What would you do it for then?
10 000 huh?
1 000 crowns! What couldn't one
do with all that money?
You and me... and Sigge Jr.
Shape up! That's enough!
-But think about it.
-..if you weren't stupid...
...if I could remember his name,
that'd change things.
Anton,
Anton Nilsson,
-Anton Nilsson?,
-Yes!
1 000 crown. Of course someone
couldn't give their mouth shut.
Let's go in.
They have caught the murderer.
-What damn Murderer?
-The man on Amalthea.
-That wasn't a murderer?
-One dead and seven injured.
-They broke the strike.
-They are people too, no?
"For the attack on the ship
Amalthea as man has been Arrested"-
-"A Man who has has very
strong circumstances".
"The arrested, Anton Nilsson belongs
to the Socialistic Youth Party"-
-"where he is considered to be one
of the most fanatic members".
"There is suspicion that other people
helped him. Investigation is ongoing."
Where are you going?
-Where do you have it?
-What?
Where have you got the money? The
thousand crowns. You've rat him out.
-Where's the money?
-I didn't do anything.
Sigge, I really don't have any money.
Sigfrid Larsson?
You're coming with us.
-What is this about?
-I think you know.
What's the big deal.
Just a little slapping around.
You call one dead and several
injured, "a little slapping around"?
You think that I have been
blowing things up?
-I'm innocent. 
-The police thinks otherwise.
Sigge, what have you done?
Yeah, yeah...
Yes.
But now Dalman has to take care
of the scum in here.
-It's been a while.
-Dalman?
Yes, he'll have to sharpen the
steel now.
I started to think about Tektor,
does that name mean anything to you?
They had to chop his head three
times before it finally fell off.
Well, don't worry, it wasn't
Dalman who did it that time.
That's the way it is.

You've got a few vocalists here.
He's singing his last tune.
But you're quiet.
-Mrs. Larsson?,
-Yes, what is this about?
I just wanted to say that
she shouldn't be afraid.
-I don't understand.
-She shouldn't worry.
He hasn't blown anything up,
at least not that night.
Sigge walked me home that night,
you know, anything can happen.
Then things went they way it did.
You know, he's a horny one.
Maybe I should talk to the police.
What do you think Mrs. Larsson?
Eat now, little Sigge,
so you get your strength back.
What do I need that for? Don't think I'll
get work just because the strike is over
Good thing you knew that Matilda...
Damn kids, what are you guys doing?
In America you'd get arrested.
Things went well for aunt Toras
husband in America.
He sent tickets to her and the kids so
they could go there and be with him.
-Have a good trip.
-Thanks.
-What this?
-A camera.
Line up.
-Look into the camera. Look at me.
-Yes.
One, two, three.
-We've got to hurry.
-We've got to go.
Bye, bye!
I'll take care of this.
I'll pawn it.
No, you're not taking it. And just so
you know, I've already pawned it.
At photographer Pedersen
on Sodra Forstadsgatan,
-Have you gone behind my back?
-Who's gone behind who's back?
-If you're gonna start with this shit...
-Here...
It was going to be a surprise for
Christmas, but now it doesn't matter.
-I took it.
-You did...?
After the strike dad didn't
get any more work in the docks.
But dad never went long without
some kind of work.
Larsson has a good hand for
both animals and people.
Alund is leaving soon.
He's obsessed with Socialism.
-You don't have that problem right?
-No, thank you, I'm not.
"Then God created the people from
Smaland and made them quick--"
-"happy and productive to be
what was needed in a poor country."
Good, Maja,
- Now it's your turn lngeborg.
-Me, Mrs.?
-Yes, lngeborg, please stand up.
"I...know..."
louder, lngeborg,
"...a country
on earth...one who...'"
No!
Enough, children!
It was a good try, lngeborg,
please sit down.
Ingeborg! Ingeborg!
Ingeborg!
Ingeborg!
God who loves all children,
look after me who's small.
Wherever I go in the world, let
my fortune stay in Gods hands.
Luck comes, luck goes, thee
who loves God luck gets.
Good. Time for bed, good night.
Here...
Good God, let lngeborg live again,
I'm sorry, Let lngeborg live again.

Good evening, come in.
Yes, I was wondering... if Maria
wouldn't photograph Ingeborg tomorrow?
For a memory. Maria will get paid.
Here you go.
I have never seen her so beautiful.
How much does it cost?
No, it doesn't cost anything.
It's in Ingeborgs memory.
Oh...
Can I keep this?
This was just something I took
before I took the actual picture
No, not just has the talent to see.
Mrs. Larsson's got it.
If I get this then you don't owe
me anything for any products.
Piff, paff, puff, and it's done.
Mrs. Larsson,
I have so many customers.
Now when my assistant is quitting,
I thought... maybe...
...Mrs. Larsson would work for me?
-Me?
-Yes.
But I can't.
The children and...


-Yes, Larsson and his little wife too.
-Good day.
-Expecting another child, I see.
-Thats right, director, number five.
Yes, such beautiful children
you can't get enough of.
Borrow the wagon tomorrow
and take the family for a trip.
-Thank you director.
-You can be proud of your man.
Hope he takes just as good care
of his wife as the horses.
Good day, thanks!
You apparently have a good connection
with the upper class.
-This is Maggan, bookseller.
-Sigfrid Larsson, ex Dock badboy.
Maria Larsson, good day.
Don't give that look, Sigge.
Maggan is mine.
Well, what have we got here then?
Good day, good day.
-Ville!
-Come on, Anton.
-Ville!
-Yes, Ville!
-What did I tell you.
-Great!
Leo!
Come!
Come now!
Leo, come!
Isn't dad going home too?
Why are you standing there staring?
Go to bed!
Hello! Here's your own old flowerman
with a flower delivery-
-to own little golden rose,
here you go.
-From the fields I've worked.
-Where have you been?
Get up! We're going to have fun.
-Hey darling, get up!
Hey, little gnomes, hit the glasses
and let us be be humorous
Mom, can we come along?
Mom, can I bring the camera?
Now we going out for a ride damnit,
that's just the way it is.
Stop!
-Stop!
-Stop!
There, there...
Five Years Later
Good day.
We moved from Malmo to Limhamn,
it was moldy and damp.
But there also was something
we never had before.
Anna, go over to walk over there
and... press the...
Oh! The light! Look at that.
Dad said that starting now
things will get better.
We got two new siblings,
Anna and Elon.
And now Ville was the family's
musician.
Both dad and Ville got work in
chalk canyon, and it was fulltime.
Maja, get in here!
-Leave Mausern alone damnit.
-Dad was happy to get mobilized.
A world war can't be worse than
the chalk canyon.
Get out the camera and take a picture
of us so you've got a memory.
-I barely know where it is.
-Englund, we're gonna take a picture.
Forget it!
Not in the uniform.
Take Mausern and stand up now,
Maggan wants a picture of her old man.

-What can I help you with?
-Mr. Pedersen, isn't he here?
The photographer is busy.
Maybe I can help you instead?
I really rather talk to
Mr. Pedersen.
Alright.
There's someone looking for
Mr. Pedersen out here.
-One moment and I'll be there.
-Okay.
Mrs. Larsson...
Yes, that wasn't yesterday.
My man wants to take a picture
of himself in his uniform.
-It's one of those years...
-Mr. Pedersen,
-Mr. Pedersen!
-One moment Captain.
I'll need some paper
and chemicals.
-Okay.
-Mrs. Petren.
-Put on thee Brandenburg Gate for him.
-Of course. - Excuse me.
