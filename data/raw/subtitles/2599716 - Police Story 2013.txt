Wake up.
We're at Bar Street.
25 RMB.
You're exhausted and still drinking
What a warrior!
Thanks.
By the way.
Want to sleep in my car?
I'm in no rush.
Where is Wu Bar please?
You're going to Wu Bar?
Turn right
at the intersection
Where are you?
I'm here.
Why don't I see you?
I'm at Bar Street.
I warn you, don't be late again.
Can't you be nice?
Today's meeting is important.
Why can't we talk at home?
You haven't been home
in 6 months.
I've booked Room 7.
Wait there.
Ridiculous.
Sir, do you have an invitation?
To what?
Our 3rd Anniversary Party.
Must I have one?
One moment.
Welcome, Mr Zhong.
You know me?
Greetings.
Pardon the foreigner's Chinese.
This way, please.
Sir, please check your coat there.
Out of the way! What invitation!
- 3rd Anniversary that's why I'm here!
- Dont touch me.
No invitation.
Captain Zhong.
Do you remember me?
I'm TV host Zhu Nan.
My partner, Quanzi, interviewed you.
What case are you working on here?
Personal stuff
I understand. Police are people too.
It's just that it's so hard
to get any news.
I just interviewed a drunk dicer. The scum--
Well talk later.
Where is room 7?
What?
Room 7.
That guy looking for Miao is here.
Just a moment, Handsome.
Life is like a cocktail,
to be savored
Thus drink be had any way
you want.
This is our Boss Wu.
Hello, I'm Wu Jiang.
Call me Zhong Wen.
How do you feel here?
Like a prison.
Yes, once you're in there's
no getting out.
I'm joking.
Miao is not here yet.
I'll show you around, come.
This was a factory,
shut down for environmental reasons.
Guess how long I took to redecorate it.
Brother Wu.
This is Brother Zhong.
It look me two years.
The other bars
demolished all these pipes.
Such wonderfull stuff,
I keep them all.
These piranhas are your idea?
They're illegal.
I don't know the law in local waters
they'd be alien invaders.
"Survival of the fittest"
is a rule of nature.
You know Miao well?
She says your business
keeps you too busy.
What a story-teller.
Freeze!
That's my favorite room.
Have a drink.
Let's talk after the clients leave.
Welcome to
Wu Bar's 3rd Anniversary party!
Room 7 is ahead, turn right.
You didn't tell me about
the celebration.
Zhong, please wait for me inside
My bar is full
I lose money by coming here.
It's been a while.
You're prettier now.
Don't touch! It will fall off.
Which bottle would you like?
I'm not drinking today.
Please, my boss expects me to sell these
Don't trouble him.
You'll never change his mind.
Put it down here.
Let's start with this.
Please wait.
I'm here. No rush.
What's with the tattoo?
I have many more
where you can't see them.
You got smarter these 6 months.
But your temper seems better.
You told Wu I'm a businessman
Should I have said you're a cop?
It's a hard, shameful,
low-paying job
Your drink, sir.
How's you hospital internship?
Don't worry about me.
Did you get that scratch today?
Did you disinfect it?
How did you get it?
Don't ask.
You dont want to tell me
Someone reported a case this morning.
A meat skewers cook stabbed someone,
had nowhere to run
and threatened suicide.
Are you jumping or not!
Calm down.
3 things.
1. Give me back my stove.
Fine.
2. I'm not paying a fine.
3...
Hurry, it's freezing
I'm not going to prison.
What are you yelling about?
I didn't yell.
See this is minor.
It's major a life was at stake.
Have you jumped before?
It's my first time.
How's your aim?
Good enough.
Brother, let's talk...
Stop. I'm not talking to you. Go!
Who will you talk to?
I'll talk to her. Bring her here.
I'll talk to her. You, get out!
This went on all day.
We were all exhausted.
I was worried he'd lose it.
So you started to talk to him.
I didn't.
Let go.
Stay still.
Help!
He's not hurt, said he'd treat me
to lamb skewers.
It's not worth it,
to risk your life for strangers.
What's so important
we need to talk here?
You'll see.
Everyone's a victim of gossip,
these days.
Don't admit anything. Goodbye.
Hello, Boss Niu.
I'm Zhu Nan,
host TV's of Life Channel.
- I've see you on TV.
- May I interview you?
What a mess!
You can't film here.
He looks familiar.
He owns a property company,
a regular.
He's rich, comes for the girls.
Boss Niu let me introduce,
this beauty, do you know her?
- Looks familiar.
- Some flirt.
Boss Niu.
She looks so familiar.
Don't be afraid.
- It's been a long time.
- He is my ex.
How did you meet Boss Wu?
He came to the hospital
with an old injury.
What do you think of him?
I don't know, so I shouldn't say.
Sorry. Brother Zhong.
There are so many clients
I neglected you.
Why did you change your look?
To introduce, this is my boyfriend.
Now you know
why we're meeting here.
You two chat, I'll make my rounds.
I don't like him.
I'm telling you, not asking.
It doesn't matter.
He's almost my age.
So what?
Look at the company he keeps.
He's stringing you along.
Why should he?
Why should I obey you?
What is it about him?
What can he give you?
I feel safe.
I'm a cop, and you feel safe with him?
He has time for me, do you?
He is my shoulder to cry on, are you?
Some cop.
Let me see what the racket is about
- Stop it.
- Get out.
Invitation see, I have one.
Get out.
I know you've
been angry with me.
I feel that I'm an orphan.
Tommorow is your mom's
death anniversary, don't say that.
Don't you talk about her.
When she was here,
you were never home.
I was sick,
she carried me to hospital
by herself,
I finally got you.
Give me back my money.
You started to care only
after she left.
I don't need you.
Come out here.
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
How dare you make trouble here?
It's only right to pay what is owed
Let the scumbag pay me
and I'll go now.
Shut up and get out!
I want the pay owed to me
and my crew.
You have a death-wish.
I do, today.
You won't get away now.
Take it easy,
I'll pay you tomorrow.
No, not tomorrow.
Take some cash,
I'll get my men to handle it.
I said, today.
This won't work.
I'll talk to him.
Who are you?
I'm just having a drink.
Please put out the fire first.
I thought it's a major incident.
It is, to me...
Turn it off!
How many years
have you been working?
I've been a laborer for 10 years.
Do you know there is a song?
It was written for me.
Turn it off!
Let's talk openly here.
Get the scumbag
into the open for once.
Don't go.
What are you doing?
One last time will pay today?
You've seen it all
I can't pay you today.
You're lying again, scumbag.
I can't pay you today.
Scumbag.
Great move!
My front tooth.
This bomb is too amateurish.
I've called the police.
- Did you film that?
- I forgot.
Get the waiters to help.
Call an ambulance.
Stop! Out of the way!
You're fine?
Where are you going?
To find Wu Jiang.
Come, sit.
Captain Zhong.
I'll interview you after Boss Niu.
The show is about to start.
I must go, my clients are waiting.
You think everyone here is weird, right?
Drunks often make trouble here.
All sorts of people show up here.
Welcome.
Two words, traffic jam.
You worry too much.
I hope that's the case.
You're suspicious of everyone.
Tonight show begins now!
Dad.
Who are you?
Get into the cage!
Don't think of getting out.
There are so many of us,
let's attack them.
Have you heard it?
Men go to help!
Inside!
How long had I been out? Wu?
Hours. You must have been exhausted
Why did you do this?
Ask why the police took so long, instead.
No one called them.
Everyone thought,
I don't want to be involved.
Do you know what you're doing?
Kidnapping. A felony.
At least 10 years jail.
Where is my daughter?
Miao? Waiting in the hall.
She's a good girl.
Don't talk about her.
She never said her dad's a cop.
That makes you a bad dad,
and a bad cop.
Am I your real target?
Sir, the police are at the door.
Ignore them. Wait downstairs.
So you called the police.
Sorry, I used your phone.
I answered a call
from your lieutenant
I described the situation.
He'll be here soon.
You were military.
Over 20 accomplished years,
in SWAT,
local regional and criminal police.
Penalized once,
which you applied for yourself.
You've done your homework.
Too bad you couldn't
handle your family.
After all these years,
your pay is so low.
It took year's pay to buy a tiny home,
is it worth it?
You don't get it.
Some things are priceless.
Lieutenant is still on his way.
No hurry.
We'll talk when he arrives.
Tell me your demands now.
Don't tell me what to do.
Hostages are hurt,
the police won't be patient
I'm patient enough.
Say what you need to say.
Fine, you're my target.
Guess why?
I've made many enemies.
Last year,
car thieves sold their loot nearby.
We're short-staffed today.
So let's stick to the plan.
There's 1 outside, 5 inside.
The white-haired one is the leader.
Do you know White Hair?
Yue.
Everyone here knows him.
Freeze! Police!
Stop! Watch them.
Yue is known to be vicious.
You'll suffer if you try
to capture him by yourself.
Please let me go.
I'll capture you myself.
Just you wait.
Your time will come.
I'll wait for you.
You did this for him, right?
I've heard of those guys.
They're ranked too low.
Most people use threats
to boost egos.
I agree.
Lieutenant, you're here.
I'm chatting with Capt. Zhong.
He's fine.
I want $80-90 million
in non-sequential bills.
Don't threaten me,
don't talk about difficulty
Wu, I don't know what you want.
Make a reasonable demand.
Lieutenant has a bad temper.
Don't raise your hopes.
If we can do it, we will.
Take it easy on him.
You don't want money.
Fine, I'll be frank.
I want to see someone.
It's easy for you to find people.
But my friend lives far away.
I haven't seen him in a while.
You like to ask why, you'll see.
Not your call?
Why are you wasting my time?
Calm down, let's talk it out.
Talk it out?
You're bluffing me?
Don't bother.
I forgot, you had been shot.
I'm curious, what's it like?
It's like taking a vicious
hit with a stick.
I couldn't find my shoulder,
or feel this side.
Then, a pain that sears
through your heart.
I've felt that searing pain.
What happened to your leg?
That was long ago.
The dark green pickup ahead.
Pull over.
Two suspects are in the truck.
The leader is a cripple.
Should be the one in the back seat.
Have you ever kidnapped anyone?
The hostage is in there.
Don't shoot.
Captain Zhong, we're going.
Stay safe.
- Take care of them.
- Don't worry.
I'll chase them.
Call dispatch. We need backup.
That's a better attitude
Are you really bad at small talk,
or just acting?
Fine. My only demand
is to see that person.
Not "we'll try".
It's a "must".
Confirm in 5 minutes.
We're in no hurry. Let's chat.
How are they?
Chao is fine. Hai broke his arm.
The backup cars
will catch up soon.
Don't be afraid. I'm a policeman.
Be brave.
Mr Policeman will come soon.
Where's the other guy?
Too bad we couldn't
save the driver.
The main perpetrator
is still on the loose.
Not a bad story,
but you guessed wrong.
I despise people who kidnap children.
This trip should
take no more than 3 hours.
Traffic is smooth at this hour.
The hostage?
Emotionally stable, pragmatic.
Sure. I'll be on lookout.
Taozi, come up,
keep your eyes on him.
Calm down.
Play some relaxing music.
Let me have a taste.
Why? For courage?
Take it easy, this stuff is strong.
What's going on?
What's wrong, Niu?
Heart attack.
Is there a doctor here?
Do you know how?
Hospital.
I'll go with you to the hospital.
We must get to a hospital.
He can't die.
Shut up.
I'm a doctor.
I must go with him to the hospital!
Out of the way!
I'm fine.
It comes and goes.
What a phoney!
Where are they?
Honestly, I'm anxious to see him.
I warn you, if my friend isn't here
All the cops
you bring will be useless.
Procedures are not my concern.
What, you want to come in?
No need.
I am a man of my word.
Wu Jiang.
When my guy arrives,
the hostages will be fine.
Wu jiang, come here.
Except Captain Zhong.
Wu Jiang.
Listen! You won't get out but...
you may make other requests.
- Open up.
- What do you want?
I need the restroom.
Anything else?
Boss Wu, may I interview you?
Sure.
Get out!
Dad, you're here!
- Are you okay?
- Sorry. Dad forgive me.
I dressedup like that to upset you.
I didn't show I cared.
You're much prettier now.
Put this away for me.
Be careful, Dad.
Where can I get a phone?
They took all our phones.
They're on the table in the hall.
But...
Hurry up!
I'm Zhu Nan,
host of the Life Channel.
I risked my life for this exclusive.
at a kidnapping.
Here is the mastermind behind this case.
Can I say that?
You must have a great story.
Boss Wu, Say hello.
Hands off, I want a drink.
So what?
Let's continue.
Do you feel that.
I'm insane for doing this?
No, why are you
committing this crime?
I just did what no one else dares.
Let me go.
I'm not done with the interview
Look...
Are you done?
You were nice to me to
get my dad here.
If you must say that.
You're using me.
I'm not a good guy,
your dad's not a good cop.
Neither of us can make you feel safe.
This is Zhong Wen,
I stole a cell phone.
Are you safe now?
I'm fine, I'm hiding.
What going on?
There are over a dozen hostages.
There were four suspects.
I got rid of one.
The boss, Wu, is the leader.
He has a knockoff 64.
What are his demands?
He wants to see a prison detainee.
What's the name?
Wei Xiaofu.
Chief has agreed
and is making arrangements.
We've made a plan
with snipers and SWAT
Are conditions suited
for a SWAT assault?
The bar is two storeys,
the hostages are in a cage,
watched by the 3 suspects.
If we attack now...
It will be too dangerous
for the hostages.
They may have other weapons.
Understood.
We may attack at any time.
Boss, that guy escaped.
I have to go.
Find him! Useless fool.
He's here.
Is that all you've got?
I bet you still can't handle him.
Brother Zhong, you're amazing.
But aren't you worried about
your daughter?
Miao said,
you used to be her hero.
How did you become a desserter?
Let's talk.
In your words,
let's talk openly.
Dad, don't worry about me.
I wanted her in my
"law of the jungle" experiment.
Don't come out, Dad.
Sure, you must think
in your dark corner,
but fingertips...
...don't grow back.
Stop!
Dad, don't come.
Dad, don't come.
Let her go. Target me.
Now you're like a good father,
but it's too late.
Stop.
I'm fine.
Give him room.
So, you are here on a case.
Where were you?
Were we in any danger?
Lady! Stop saying stupid things.
What did I say?
You don't stop talking!
So annoying!
With this scoop,
she'll be promoted tomorrow.
None of your business.
I'm fine.
Let me go.
Do you think I can escape?
I'm sure you will. You'll be fine.
From my experience,
he'll release us soon.
In all kidnappings...
They'd be killing the hostages now.
It's usually about money.
I know Wu well. He's rich.
It's more than that.
Is there a back door here?
There's just this door.
Boss designed the bar.
He sealed the back door.
What does your father do?
He's a policeman.
Such hatred, beating him so badly.
Must be over a girl.
Don't worry. We don't know him.
I know you.
The drug store.
The thief, he stole from me.
That's right.
I didn't recognize you
without your uniform.
She was there that day, too.
That's Lan, now a manager
at the nightclub.
And the famous Boss Niu.
We were all there.
Something happened inside.
Captain Zhong is in there.
What happened?
We're together again.
That's destiny.
Cut the nonsense.
Comrade Policeman,
what's your issue with Wu?
Talk it out with him,
why involve us?
Destiny, my foot.
Chief Zhang, a high official.
I'm so honored, they're all fine.
You want to see them, right?
Look. They're lively and well-fed.
I am Police Chief Zhang Guomin.
Don't worry.
I will do my best to help you all.
Boss Wu, go ahead, we'll wait.
Film this area and the people.
My friend is still not here.
You are unreliable.
Give us more time.
Several reasons...
I don't care. You have 5 minutes.
Give me face, 5 more minutes.
If he is not here in 10 minutes,
I'll turn violent
Please come, Boss Wu.
I want to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Alone.
Our usual place.
Zhong, what more is there to say?
You just want us.
Why involve innocents?
I need more chips.
And how do you know
they're innocent?
What do want to say?
You created an elaborate plot.
Yes.
But you can't win with your way.
We'll see.
You need a middle-man.
I can help.
A cop helping a criminal.
What a joke.
What do you want
to know from that case?
I don't want to discuss that now.
Then we'll wait for Wei Xiaofu.
You ask lots of questions. My turn.
You cops don't often
see this situation, right?
We see all kinds.
How many cases
have you been on?
Many, over 100 a year.
How many cops die in a year?
About 400 die in the line
of duty in China.
And how many hostages?
Accidents happen.
Will there be an accident today?
I don't want casualties today.
Including me?
Yes. Every life is precious.
I stopped believing that long ago.
Although you've done
your homework.
Zhong, you sneaked
into my secret chamber.
So you know some of my secrets.
You can see
this is beyond negotiation.
So we have nothing to talk about.
I see you're a boxer.
I have some time,
let me tell you a story.
You asked what happened
to my leg.
As a boy,
I went overseas with my father.
He killed himself due to gambling debts.
I had to repay them.
The only skill I had there
was fighting.
I had always fought,
on others behalf.
Fighting is about
who is more vicious.
I never had a worthy opponent.
You risk your life for money,
but life is so worthless and fleeting.
I swore to stop once
I repaid the debts.
So during that time
I was like a crazy man.
I finally repaid all the debts.
but I didn't want
to do anything else.
It was all about money, life and death.
So, I continued.
You may be killed
by your opponent at any time.
My nickname was Spider,
I never lost.
But a spider is an insignificant bug.
All illegal boxers are the same.
You knew your men from boxing
The foreigners were the best
in their countries.
The shorter one, Pichon,
is a regular champion.
Everyone wanted us to fight,
I know it is inevitable.
Before the fight,
I felt the bets were too big.
The better fighter you are,
the more you're worth
and the closer to death you are.
What happened at that fight?
In the beginning we were even.
Then he got the upper hand.
The next round, he'll let you win.
The two bosses
had arranged everything.
I found out just
before the final round.
It was a fight to the death.
Next round, kill him.
Boss didn't know
my heart was soft that day.
I'd decided to return to China
after the fight,
and bring some fighters
to help me.
Poor Pichon,
only knew he was to lose.
I told him he had been fixed to die.
Disobeying the boss meant death.
So several of us escaped
and hid for a time.
We're lucky to the here, alive.
Why did you suddenly go soft?
As you say, you don't get it.
You've lived quite a life.
But one can't treat
another's life lightly.
Everyone has the right to live.
To live well
You know why I'm still alive?
You came back
to China 5 years ago,
just for drug store robbery.
For the truth.
The world is full of lies.
Is this the only way
to find the truth?
I should say, it's my way.
Don't sit.
Don't sit.
Amazing!
You almost succeeded.
This bullet-proof glass
is worth every penny.
It's a police rescue effort,
you'd do the same.
Your plan was good,
snipers and SWAT together,
but I'm no amateur thief.
Why didn't you let me sit?
I wanted to save you.
You want to help me
and save me.
He's on screen.
- There were gunshots.
- Chief Zhang, I'm still alive.
Your Captain Zhong?
He also lives.
Cut the nonsense.
Let me see Wei Xiaofu.
Why did you get me here
so late at night?
Get him in here to see me.
You're kidding!
I don't want to go in.
It's against the rules
to bring a prisoner here.
Please know we must
guarantee his safety.
You're tricking me.
You must see Wei Xiaofu, right?
Let me break it down for you.
You're armed, took hostages
and are at a stalemate.
I can kill some hostages.
And I'll make sure
you'll never see Wei.
And, the police will find
another way to attack.
What are you saying?
Only I can help you
to see him.
He trusts me,
I can bring him in.
I'll talk to him,
you free the hostages.
Think about it.
Life is like a cocktail.
What does the next sip taste like?
I've filmed everything
you told me to.
Trust my skills.
And if you don't come back?
Trust me, I will.
But you must guarantee Wei's safety.
You dare to trust my guarantee?
Trust is mutual.
Take two people.
Your daughter stays.
I said, all the hostages.
Impossible, I must keep some.
I know which ones.
Let the rest go.
No.
No deal.
- Three.
- No deal.
You can only bring 3 hostages.
Put down your gun.
You two have hot tempers.
Here. You two fight.
You win, I promise
you can bring people out.
You lose, go alone.
Dad, you're hurt.
You can't defeat him.
Don't fight.
You're not young anymore.
It's embarrassing to lose.
Never mind.
Why? Fight!
You're a cop!
Good prevails over evil.
Take us out.
Fine.
Agreed.
Comrade Police, it's all on you!
Go, go!
Be careful, Dad.
In a few seconds,
you won't be able to get up.
This fight is too hard.
We cannot benefit from his loss.
Pray for him.
Captain Zhong,
no shame in giving up.
Stop playing the hero, Dad.
Zhong, give up
if you can't handle it.
Dad, stop!
You can't beat them.
Get up. Cop!
Go. Mr Policeman.
Beat him.
How suspenseful.
He is good.
Stop, Dad.
Stay down or you'll die.
Stop fighting.
We don't want
to go out any more.
Cop, we are moved,
you tried your best.
Mr Policeman,
we don't want to go any more.
Stop, don't get up.
Please stop fighting,
I beg you.
Don't let go! Hang on tight!
He can't last! Harder!
Careful, Cop.
Cop, let go! Watch out.
Let go. You won.
You won.
Give me your scarf.
Don't lock up again!
Aren't we all going?
- Here's an idea.
- I'll take my daughter out first.
When Wei Xiaofu comes in,
she may go.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying here
with my dad till the end.
Don't regret it
As agreed,
I'll give you the man you want.
Bring three people with you first!
Why change now? This is too much.
It's leverage in case
you don't come back.
I'll release them
just before Wei comes in.
That's not a change,
choose the hostages.
Wu, I really can't go on.
I'll forfeit the money.
My health is poor.
May I be one of them?
Wu, if you think I'm useful
to you I'll stay.
I'll go out to film, okay?
Have you decided?
The two injured hostages,
and him.
You.
Me? Just me?
No. I'm staying with my girlfriend.
Only you dared make a move.
We need more men like you.
I'll make an exeption.
Go together.
Hurry.
You're a casualty, you lost a tooth.
Just me?
We're inseparable.
I owe him money.
I need to pay him outside.
You'd have enough to pay
if you'd drink less.
Captain Zhong, you must return.
Zhong.
You have 10 minutes,
I'm very punctual.
Hostages are coming!
We need a stretcher.
There are four more.
This is a suspect, cuff him.
You saved my life.
Hurray for the Policeman!
There are more people back here.
- Are you badly hurt?
- I'm okay. It's minor.
Chief Zhang.
Check out these suspects.
3 suspects and 3 gunns.
Where are they located?
In the main hall, with 16 hostages.
Physical conditions of the hostages?
All right. But they can't last
much longer mentally.
Lieutenant.
I felt you took action
too soon just now.
Captain Zhong,
the suspect wants to talk to you.
I'll tell you everything I know.
Speak.
I did this for money.
I never imagined
he'd make such a big deal.
Please don't go in.
You'll never get back out.
They told me they dont expect
to get out alive.
That's all I know.
Thank you, sir.
These are from
the building's management.
We have 8 more minutes.
It differs from the blueprint,
the windows are sealed.
This door,
is made with 25cm-thick steel panels.
The walls are 50cm thick.
There was a back door
but it's been sealed.
He is from building management.
How could you allow all
these changes?
It's their private property.
Out of our jurisdiction.
Fine, I'll call you if I need you.
He really made himself a fortress.
Over here?
You can go in from the roof here
and be hidden.
7 more minutes.
This is a home-made bomb
with a timer.
The wiring is complex,
with multiple detonators.
He means to blow up everyone,
including himself.
There are so many hostages.
The best way to save them
is for me to bring Wei in.
Trading 3 people for 12.
Has he agreed to go in?
I was on the phone
with my mother.
She wants me to behave,
to try for early release.
Please help us.
It's too risky.
Your safety is a concern.
It may be dangerous
but we'll try our best
Help us, we'll apply
to reduce your sentence.
I still feel unsafe. Forget it.
We cannot force you
to take this great risk
Thank's for taking care
of my mom all these years.
I promised years ago that I would.
Everyone on our team donated
to your family.
I'm touched.
Here is the information
on the suspects.
Bin, a Thai.
Pichon, a Filipino.
Wu Jian, returned 5 years ago,
as a Thai.
The victim Mei's parents
were divorced.
The mother died,
a brother went overseas
with the father.
I think Wu Jiang is Mei's brother.
He's not asking
for Wei Xiaofu's release.
3 of the hostages
were witnesses back then.
I think he wants to know
what happened.
Cops, criminals, witnesses, all here.
It's been 5 years.
You have 4 more minutes.
Let's talk method.
We'll dress as Zhong and Wei,
SWAT stands by.
First, cut open the roof by laser.
The door opens,
we attack from above and below.
It's hard to attack
through the crack in the door.
This way, we get their attention.
Roof-cutting time varies.
We'll endanger the hostages.
Hostages safety comes first.
Let me negotiate again.
You can't.
lives are at stake.
talk is useless.
This is too major.
It calls for a hard-core assault.
Assaults are most risky now.
And you're not taking a risk
by going back in?
Keeping my promise will build trust.
There is still a chance to talk.
You've been talking for 6 hours.
Some negotiations last 6 months,
you know?
No.
We got the injured
hostages out with talk.
Lieutenant was looking out for you.
Trading 2 for 12, good deal.
See? As Lieutenant,
I should go in, not you.
It's my case,
the same one as 5 years ago.
I'm most suited to go in.
Besides, my daughter is inside.
Shouldn't he stay away
for that reason?
Stop arguing
Zhong should go back in.
But get a substitute for Wei.
Wu will know at a glance.
Chief Zhang, please come here.
Repeat what I say.
"3 more minutes."
- The thug says...
- What?
Boss Wu says, "3 more minutes."
"If he doestn't come, you will die."
"If he doesn't come,"
- "I will die."
- "No Joke."
"No joke."
He's really not joking, help!
Less than 3 minutes now.
Chief Zhang,
Wei Xiaofu has agreed to go in.
Reason?
1... to repay our favor,
2... he doesn't want to cause evil.
He's a real man.
Make a small opening to save time.
Go!
Yes, sir! Run.
Bomb Squad, give Wei a suit.
The Lieutenant is in charge.
It's on you.
Guoqiang, this is your sniper operation.
As you say,
your own safety is key.
Sniper needs to set up.
Buy time with talk.
On my orders.
It's already loaded.
Dont be angry.
I didn't want you
to bear this alone.
If possible, let me talk a bit more.
If I can control the scene,
don't let the sniper shoot.
You win.
You can still smile?
These clothes are safe and warm.
But it weighs over 35 kgs.
Does this count as a merit?
So, I may get a reduced
sentence for this?
I can still care for my mom
in this lifetime.
- The roof cutting team is in place.
- Yes.
Hurry.
Say something, Captain Zhong.
Are you being brave
for your daughter?
How is it your daughter is here?
If she wasn't here,
would you dare to go back in?
What's wrong with her?
When the hostages come out
we'll go in.
Once we go in,
will we get out alive?
I promise to keep you alive
as long as I live.
What if you die first?
Just Kidding.
I'm a nervous wreck.
Once inside,
stay next to me and don't move.
- May I speak?
- Speak the truth, not nonsense.
What did you stuff into
my clothes just now?
That's nonsense.
Arms..
You should get a job
at Airport Security.
Again, bullshit.
Police.
Police! Hurry, help!
What's going on?
Talk, don't hit.
We're in positions of power.
- These sons of bitches.
- Where's my daughter?
Dad, I'm here.
I'm fine.
You take care.
Help! Police!
I'm afraid of heights.
Your outfit is awesome,
can you get us out?
What is all this?
What's tied around our necks?
Can you tell me what's going on?
It looks like a bomb.
Is it real?
Five, four...
Three...
Two...
One...
It's real.
We're missing one person.
Maybe a hostage is still inside.
Good job, Captain Zhong.
You really brought him in here.
I'm a man of my word.
I want to evacuate the hostages.
Your crimes are not serious.
We can explain everything away.
I can prove you stopped voluntarily.
You can't help me.
It's my time now.
18 more minutes.
What is he wearing?
What a ridiculous getup.
- We must do our best to protect him.
- This is my turf. You can't protect him.
You had guaranteed his safety.
His temporary safety.
In this getup.
I don't recognize him.
Remove his helmet.
Helmet off.
Stay back.
- Stay back!
- Don't play this game with me.
They despise me.
I'm not afraid.
He thinks I'll cause evil.
- Stay back!
- I don't want to wear this
It's stuffy, I'm dizzy.
I'm not afraid.
Wei Xiaofu.
Isn't that, who it is?
How come it's him?
Put on your helmet.
Relax. Captain Zhong.
I'll be with you now.
The police forced you
to come, right?
You're wrong, I came willingly.
You've gathered everyone.
The truth will be known.
I've been waiting for this day.
Big brother,
when will you be back?
Everyone knows this girl, right?
Now you know,
she is my baby sister.
We were separated,
I found her 5 years ago.
She's the meaning of my life.
I came back,
but didn't see her.
I finally found a way
to meet with you.
I don't know what happened,
5 years ago.
But you were all there.
Let's talk.
It's been so long.
What if I can't remember?
The bomb is remote controlled.
It may help you think.
Let me think, I should remember.
Let's begin.
When we're done
I can go back out, right?
Someone won't make it out today.
Then what can I do
to make sure I will?
Don't mess with me,
but that's hard for you.
Say your piece. Hurry.
Who should speak first?
Cutting the roof takes time.
The team is worried
about disturbing those below.
You're right.
My first idea won't work.
Just play for time.
Let me start.
Wait, Zhong.
Remove your communications devices,
so I won't have to.
We're trying other ways to break in
We can start the assault
in 15 minutes.
Till then,
you're in charge of the inside.
Wei Xiaofu, you start.
It all started with me.
That night, almost at this time.
A few customers were
at the drug store, I went in.
I want to do something for my mom
She's in poor health.
But I can't afford tonics.
My mistake was being too nosy.
I'll give you 20 extra.
I wanted to ask
whose wallet that was.
No way,
who are you trying to kid?
You were drunk,
what do you know?
I was drinking,
but my mind was clear.
Hand it over.
What is this?
I just picked it up from the floor.
- You stole it.
- I just picked it up.
Do you know who I am?
You dare to steal my stuff?
Go to hell.
I really did pick it up.
Wait.
Don't move.
And then?
Then...
Quickly.
- I am
I am dearest on what happened next
Go to hell!
I really picked it up.
Wait.
Don't move.
This is mine.
Did you pick it up, too?
Does he have any more?
Two boxes.
I'm a man of principles.
I convince with reason.
Were you being reasonable?
I call it as i see it.
That's called hitting me
when I'm down.
What?
I remember every word
you said that night.
This box costs tens of thousands.
You have good taste.
Shall we handle it ourselves,
or call the police?
Handle it or police.
You can't tell? He's poor.
Call the police.
Sure, I'll call them now.
Don't call the police.
I was afraid it would
become a big deal.
That's how it became a big deal.
Who dares to call the police?
Don't!
Stop, if you want to live.
What do you mean?
What do you want?
Give it to me.
Give it over. Now!
Hello, Police?
Thinking back I really was confused.
I should have run,
they wouldn't have stopped me.
But I...
Give me the phone.
We're being robbed!
The drug store by Gu Lou.
Give it to me! Let go!
When my sister was thrown
to the ground.
You just looked on.
He was closest, he ran.
What could I have done?
Of course I wanted to approach,
but they left.
I'm not experienced with one-on-one.
I wasn't scared,
but he dragged me away.
And then?
I'll tell the story for you
I was off-duty and passed by...
Comrade Police,
something's happening there.
Don't move. Stay away.
He stole something.
She called the police.
The thief, he...
Step out.
Stop. Don't come over.
Call dispatch, notify local police.
- I was thinking then...
- I'll tell it for you.
The criminals may kill the hostages.
Don't move! Back off!
Captain Zhong has the power to...
- One more step and I'll kill her.
- ...easily and decisively kill you.
You're being ridiculous.
If thats the case,
there wouldn't be a problem.
All life is precious.
Without understanding...
Captain Zhong is used
to talking it out.
There's no rush.
Let's talk it out.
But Zhong was distracted.
His wife was...
run over by a car...
and being treated in hospital.
The hospital and
his daughter kept calling him.
- I get it.
- Why are you on the phone?
- I'll be right there.
- Hang up!
Wei Xiaofu gets out of control.
Are you tricking me?
What do you want?
Do you think I'm bluffing?
And the rest is history.
Captain Zhong,
tell us what's going on inside.
You tell great stories.
How can you be sure?
Were you there?
How do you know everything?
Are you done speaking?
It's my turn.
Miao will tell you,
but she doesn't know much.
That night, my wife
was running a high fever.
I was working and
couldn't take her to the hospital.
She forbidden her to go.
She took a cab alone,
and the accident happened.
I ignored my phone,
but felt something was wrong.
I felt rushed that day.
Captain Zhong
was so patient that day.
Take your time,
we'll talk everything out.
When I called back I found out
what happened.
By the time
I rushed to the hospital.
It was too late.
I wanted to explain
to my daughter, but..
she would neither listen
to or forgive me.
I had tried
to convince him to stop.
I took the drugs for my mom.
Let's clarify everything
and do what must be done.
Let the girl go.
It would be bad if she got hurt.
We'll think of a way
to help your mother.
Will that do?
So can't you let me go?
Please!
Wei was agitated.
Your sister was quite calm.
I didn't know what to do.
Suddenly...
Accidents always happen suddenly.
Fine. Let me continue.
It was chaos outside.
Your sister said, softly,
"Kill me."
What did she say?
She spoke very softly.
I thought I mis-heard.
What did you say?
You heard it, too?
I heard her cry out, once.
That was her second cry.
What did you say?
"Kill me."
What are you doing?
It wasn't me, I didn't move.
Ambulance.
She injured her carotid artery
and bled to death.
This is the truth you wanted.
So my sister killed herself.
Of course,
I used my knife as a bluff.
I never guessed she would grab it,
it scared me.
Why should I believe you?
I believe him.
You weren't even there.
She was troubled.
See what drug she bought
What drug?
What drug did she buy?
Manager, I'm afraid you must tell us.
What are you doing?
Testing for leaks.
You're paying for this.
Sleeping pills.
Prescription?
100 pills.
By law, it's sold
by prescription only.
I am a man of principle.
And then?
I'll take over from here.
The law is dead. People are alive.
A warning,
to pull a bluff, just take a few.
Can I buy them or not?
Sure,...
but it doesn't cost this much.
I'll give you a few more pills, then
Coming, one moment, please.
- Are you done?
- Yes.
Continue.
What? They're all the same.
You broke up?
It's always that.
I've taken them before.
It's horrible.
I didn't die, had my stomach pumped,
vomitted like mad.
What else did you say?
Nothing
You're no angel.
I remember what you said next.
What true love?
I don't trust anyone any more.
There are so many men.
We're not the same kind of people.
What do you mean?
Playing innocent.
You're so blind!
Just go and die.
- When did I say all that?
- You said it.
Wu, I never did.
I tried to talk to her
Your sister died because
of what she said.
You sold her the drug knowing
she was depressed.
I can prove he sold her the drug
They're working together.
Shut up!
Calm down.
They did find sleeping pills on her.
Does buying
sleeping pills equal suicide?
Extreme agitation
may cause dire actions.
I know why.
Watch what you say.
Half of female suicides
are for a man.
The other half are for several men.
- Boss Wu...
- I say so because I've done it.
I realize now it's not worth it,
but many don't.
Listen to me.
I completely understand
how you feel.
It's hard to live alone
abroad for so many years.
Your sister was your only family,
the light of your life.
Knowing she died,
you returned to investigate...
or take it out on someone.
That's natural
Go on.
You  have 5 more minutes.
You planned this
to punish her killer, right?
Regardless of method,
you have the wrong target.
You mean you are all innocent
What Lan said makes sense.
Explain yourself.
There is something you must know.
Your sister was pregnant
at the time.
She sees you as a parent,
she must have told you.
Stop.
When the M.E. discovered
her pregnancy, we investigated.
She had no marriage record,
and the father never came.
See? Men are not worth it!
Clearly no one
here is the person you seek.
Even if you find him,
there might be a story there.
- You're trying to confuse me.
- I want to clear your mind.
Even so, you're out of time.
Look, you've made
it like a trial today.
- Each one of you is guilty.
- The law has already...
You just watched as my sister died?
You, a cop.
I admit I made mistakes.
It was your knife.
Does 10 years jail pay for her life?
What do you want from me?
Niu, Lan, you stood
by while she died.
- You're killers.
- What did I do?
No one minds
others business any more.
At least let me know
why I have to die.
I helped her.
I tried to talk her out of it.
She didn't trust anyone.
It's not my fault.
- Manager.
- Put on your helmet.
For a small profit,
you let my sister die.
I'm not the only one.
And she didn't die from the drugs.
No one shoots!
Tell them to put down their guns.
Don't force me to shoot.
Stop, Wu.
You can still live
if you surrender now.
No shooting.
Fine.
Stop shouting or I'll shoot you.
This is a great outfit.
Drop your guns.
Careful behind you, Dad.
Life is like a cocktail.
Drink it all to know...
if it was bitter or sweet.
You're hard to handle.
Meet Kun,
Bartender and bomb maker.
My leg.
What do you want?
Don't worry. This is fake.
The real ones come later.
None of you can hide from them.
Please! Spare us!
Why didn't you just kill me?
Glad you understand.
I'm saving you.
But it's over.
Not yet.
You're my sister's boyfriend, right?
What kind of joke is this?
I found half a picture
among her things.
I remember your tattoo.
You've changed it,
but I still know it.
Really?
Really?
Since Zhong has said so,
I'll tell you.
Yes.
I am him.
Interesting.
I thought you escaped long ago.
Yet you work
and make bombs for me.
Why are you pointing
your gun at me?
I want to see
how you avenge Mei's death.
Good for you.
We're really all here.
I was a coward then.
But now I know I'll be last to go,
I fear nothing.
Speak quickly.
You have 2 minutes to live.
Wu, you had a part
in her death, too.
What?
She told me...
you didn't want her to be with me.
But I genuinely fell in love
with her.
She got pregnant and told you.
But you said
you'd come to kill me.
She was so hurt
There was no hope for me,
so I broke up with her.
That night, we had a big fight.
She stormed out, crying.
I ran after her.
Even that final time
we looked at each other...
we never knew
how fragile life would be...
I lived for revenge.
Now I know
how much she hated me.
What one didn't treasure,
one may not salvage.
Right, Wu?
Come, the gun is in your hands.
Wu.
I wronged her the most.
I most deserve to die.
Get down!
Dad!
Miao!
Dad, I'm here.
Dad I'm here.
You missed the first train.
I could have gotten on,
but there's no point.
You destroyed my plan.
Your plan?
Why must you harm my daughter?
Everyone's lives
are worthless except Mei's
No one has the right
to take other's lives in anger.
Stay away!
My sister didn't deserve to die.
So you have to hurt more people?
If she were alive,
would she want this?
But she's dead.
She'll never return.
Then you must
treasure life even more!
Dad.
Let my daughter go.
This is the same scene
as 5 years ago.
Shoot. You get a merit.
I get to die.
Win-win.
Of course,
there may be accidents.
I beg you,
let my daughter go.
If I do, will it be over?
You must pay for your actions.
Throw the gun over.
Don't obey.
Don't let him have the gun.
Throw the gun over.
Wu Jiang.
You're right. Someone must pay.
I will do anything for my sister.
Sadly, now I know
I'll never escape.
Zhong, we will have
this last game.
There's 1 bullet left.
Shoot before the next train.
Shoot me and I'll stab her neck.
Shoot yourself and she lives.
Dad, don't believe him.
Shoot me and I'll stab her neck.
Shoot yourself and she lives.
Don't shoot, I'll kill her anyway.
Who lives? Who dies?
It's up to you.
I was late then because
I was saving someone else.
I was wrong to blame you.
Unfortunately, I failed there, too.
Zhong, the train is coming.
I'll take responsibility
for your sister's death.
My daughter
has nothing to do with this.
Please don't hurt her,
no matter what.
I want to see you
be that kind of father.
I'll give you 10 seconds
before I shoot.
No, Dad.
Ten... nine... eight...
Chil, I've been a bad father.
I had no time for you,
and made you feel vulnerable.
Sorry.
...three...
But... for you
I will do anything.
...one.
Sorry,
I removed the bullet just now.
I would do anything for my sister.
A small trick.
Zhong, I admire you. Go.
- Wait for me on the platform.
- Dad, I cannot go.
Go get someone!
This is an order! Now!
Run!
Is there anything else, Zhong?
- I must arrest you.
- Say I vanished.
I'll do anything for my sister.
I'd die for her.
Wu Jiang!
- Get out of my way.
- It's not worth it!
I'll take the blame for my deeds!
Ignored me, as if I were a bug.
Don't worry about me.
Give up. You can still live.
Goodbye.
Hurry, get a doctor!
Hang in there.
- You threw the switch?
- Yes, perfect timing, right?
Wait...
Good one, brother.
That hurt.
All hostages are safe,
no penalty for you.
How's Wei Xiaofu?
He's a tough kid.
Take care of your father.
- Dad, you're great.
- I'm very ordinary.
Stop being humble, cop.
Take it easy on me
from now on.
Wu Jiang says,
you win this round.
This is for you.
He says goodbye.
