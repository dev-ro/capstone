Ingratitude to the man who
has helped is sin,
the man who helped you
expecting gratitude is also sin.
It's not great to be
part of history, Kulkarni,
having a history to
ourselves is great!
Entire state is under
Bhagawan's control,
that's why all of us are under his shadow,
so he gets all the business,
what if Bhagawan dies?
What if we kill him?
You're wrong.
Brother, please listen to him.
Bhagawan's son Munna is coming
back to India after 8 years,
Bhagawan will go personally
to receive him,
we're getting 300 grams of
gelatin sticks for Rs.16 only,
if we blow, even rocks would
be blown to smithereens,
there's a culvert on the way
back to Bhagawan's home,
5 gelatin sticks under it.
You're committing a big mistake.
You're new to this business.
I'd been with Bhagawan for 10 years.
I know about every member of his gang.
Bhagawan isn't just one man!
My boys will take care of Guru.
Yes, I'm Guruvaiah here.
No... no I'll be there.
Make it fast!
I'm not saying about Guru,
I said about Bhagawan's shadow.
I meant about Bhagawan's strength.
About Jai!
He'll die first!
Car stopped!
What could be the reason?
How would I know? Let's check!
Can I make a phone call?
Listen to me,
escape while still alive.
You're still alive because of Veeru.
If not I would've killed you long back.
There's much difference between
killing me and you getting killed.
Do you know what it is? Jai!
He's here!
This is your last chance.
Don't leave him.
- I'll not. I'll kill him.
Hey, jump over the wall and escape.
I'll not tell anyone.
I told you to shut up, right? Shut up!
Hey, escape I say!
Come... come...
Shut up!
You've come after 8 years,
I'm very happy sir.
I feel like seeing your father
in his youth.
But I'm really sad, uncle.
28 years have passed,
I thought you'd be dead,
you're still alive!
Your razor sharp eyes are
pouncing paws...
Fire spitting breath is your paw...
Hot blood flowing in nerves is paw...
Energy is every cell is paw...
Unstoppable speed is paw...
Devil-may-care attitude is paw...
Silence on lips is paw...
Lightning decisions is paw...
Like a simmering fire hidden underneath
like darkness hiding in night...
If it's unavoidable war,
won't see tomorrow's dawn...
Sky is your paw...
Win over it with courage...
Ferociousness is your paw...
March forward as vitality
to end the evil...
Check it, dad. It has everything.
Like them!
Like him!
Aren't you ajoker?
Politicians, Industrialists, IAS, IPS,
all these people have power.
But the control is in my hands.
That's why people like us are
called as power managers.
And today, power is the most
powerful amongst everything,
including lives!
Why didn't you come to
airport to receive me?
Had I come there,
we wouldn't be meeting here?
Munna, you appear to have grown thin.
What happened to you?
Why didn't you come?
Why didn't I come?
Few minutes late,
you would've come to see me.
Don't talk rubbish!
Is there anything I should know?
If there's anything I need to tell you,
you don't have to ask me, dada.
Do you know how the bomb reached
Veeru's car from culvert?
You didn't expect me here, right?
I told him you're committing
a big mistake.
For how many years I know you?
What's your problem?
According to the natural law ofjustice,
big fish eats the small fish in lake.
What's this lake? Tell me who is
big fish and who is small fish?
This business is the lake.
Big lake!
Bhagawan is the big fish.
I'm a small fish.
You know you're a small fish, right?
Tell me further.
For any job in this state,
people come to you.
Everyone come to you.
- So what?
If everyone go to you,
how am I to run my business?
That's your problem,
what do you want me to do?
Close your eyes.
I know very well what you would
do if I close my eyes.
You don't know how much
is my offer, right?
How much?
Kulkarni, don't try to become
Bhagawan of this city.
Either you or if anyone else tries,
I'll kill you first. Mind it!
When I broke away from
Bhagawan 4 years ago,
you promised not to kill me.
Your word has value, Jai.
What the hell he gives a word, brother?
What if we kill him?
Don't kill him.
I promised not to kill Kulkarni not you.
What's this?
Why are you so loyal to Bhagawan?
You may not understand
even if I tell you.
Tell me, I'll try to understand.
It's known as loyalty! Loyalty!
I said you'll not understand it.
Why do you ask things
which you can't understand?
Guruvaiah, come.
Caress me sensuously
with your hands...
Waiting for sensitive touch...
Come like hot embrace and
light fire of passion in me...
Take out life from me
and instill a new life in me...
Squeeze me like pillow and
douse the raging fire of desire...
You've got me like treasure
never even dreamed about...
What do you apply to those legs?
They's shining!
8 years ago you weren't
so voluminous.
2You've changed a lot.
You haven't changed at all.
Still don't know how to talk.
When I'm here, where are you going?
There many who go mad
on seeing me,
there are many more who would
die if they don't see me.
I'm a beautiful female cheetah...
always pouncing hungrily...
I love playing with the hunter's spear...
I'll come to you willingly
on my own free will...
I'll haul and maul you
with my passions...
Caress like gentle breeze and
hound me like thunder...
Make me squeal with the pain of
pleasure with your youthful force...
Hey look! For me only!
You're dead man!
Leave me boys!
Why did you beat me now?
How dare you see Jahnavi?
I'll kill you. - Come on!
Come on shoot me if you've guts.
Leave me, I'll kill him.
How dare you want Jahnavi!
Gurubhai, please come immediately,
Munna is creating terrible here.
I'll kill him...
he'll die in my hands today.
Gaurav, leave him,
Munna is Bhagawan's son.
Let him be Bhagawan's son or
anyone else, I don't care!
I'll kill him, tell him to say sorry.
Gaurav, give me the gun first.
Look at him Jai! What has he done?
I'm seeing, give me your gun first.
No, he's dead today,
will he kill for seeing Jahnavi?
I'll kill if you see her.
I'll talk to him, give me the gun.
What's this Munna?
You've to shut down the club if you
don't want anyone to see Jahnavi.
Silly creep! Bloody crap!
Where did you get this gun?
Do you've license?
Does your father know this?
You're going to London for MC,
why are you carrying a gun?
Do you know the future of
man holding a gun? Do you know?
Do you know?
Go... go...
Did you see? Did you see him?
Go!
It seems you wanted to see me, Dada.
Who am I to you, Jai?
Please don't take the club
incident seriously.
No, please tell me Jai.
Who am I to you?
You're everything to me, dada.
You too know it very well.
If you do anything for profit,
it's business,
if you do anything for good deeds
it's piousness,
if you do anything without
any expectation it's service.
The help and courage you gave in the
matter of my sister and mother,
I can never forget in my life.
I'm not here because
you'll support me,
I'm here to be as your shadow.
Will you be Munna's shadow too?
Don't think too much,
why are you asking me anyway?
Just told me who am I to you,
I know how much you value my word,
Jai, please take care of Munna.
How you looked after me, you must
look after Munna too just like that.
You will, I trust you will.
Everyone wants something in life,
money, position, status,
pleasure or something,
but I want the happiness I've lost.
I want love.
I've been searching for 20 long years.
This nursery is manifestation
of my memories.
Everything is fine but
something is not fine, Chotu.
Everything is fine but
something is not fine.
Why are you repeating it?
- I'm feeling, not repeating.
Good, there are plants, pots,
appears to be beautiful,
but something is missing.
Good, there are plants, pots,
appears to be beautiful,
but something is missing.
What else can I do?
I watered the plants,
used slices of onions, egg shells,
tied threads for creepers,
and built protective cover.
What else can I do?
I've given a paper ad.
If you give an ad in paper,
would plants grow here?
Is this your nursery?
Is this your nursery?
Come in from that side.
Whose owns this nursery?
- I own it.
I've not seen any place here
more beautiful than this.
But who is the caretaker
who maintains it so clumsily?
Tell me.
Growing plants is science.
He's the caretaker, he reads the books.
It's not in books,
we need food for strength,
plants need mud,
- Mud?
They need water for thirst,
- Water?
If it's sunny, it needs shade,
- Shade?
If it's dusty, it needs bath,
and a way to grow,
Is there so much?
- Plants too need love just like us.
Love?
Didn't I tell you plants too need love?
Did you listen to me?
Didn't I tell you plants too need love?
Did you listen to me?
When did you tell me?
I told you but failed to
understand it, you dullard.
By the way, who are you?
That's him, the man with beard.
He'll plant something!
Do you've to study so much
to grow plants?
Chotu, please...
How will you make this beautiful
nursery more beautiful?
Small correction.
How will you beautify this bad
and ugly nursery?
What if I make it?
Every moment is filled with
freshness of greenery...
It's true you're my life forever...
May I share your grief...
may I enhance your happiness...
This world smiles along
with our smile...
O friend, I'm coming...
I'll give my life for you...
Is it good?
- Very good.
She has grown the plants with songs.
Shall I also try?
- No please.
Sandhya, take whatever you want.
- Take it.
Get the cheque book.
Don't stare like an owl,
get the cheque book. Go!
He'll give cheques to women.
Ask whatever you want for
the job well done, Sandhya?
How much will you pay me?
It's priceless!
Whatever you may ask!
Take it.
Please bend down.
- Why?
Shut up and bend.
Come near.
Tell me Sandhya,
I've the cheque book and pen.
How much? - Rs.1 or 2 lakhs?
Rs.70 lakhs!
A row house in gated community!
Rs.2 crores!
What else?
Give her this nursery too!
We both can work for her then.
I didn't do this for money, Jai.
Many people are cutting down trees
to make roads for selfish ends,
bringing down mountains
to build homes,
filling up lakes to build colonies,
very few people are growing plants,
I love people who do it.
That's why I did it.
How come the door is open?
The door is open, you fool.
- How would I know?
I told you many times not to give
the duplicate keys to her.
No, I didn't give.
She took it from me.
If I refuse she threatened to get me
beaten up by hired goons.
If I kill you, it'll end my problems.
Check what she's up to!
Come out! Enough of taking bath,
come out Janu.
Is tap dry in your flat?
No, but water isn't so good there.
I've warned you many times
not to come here.
As many times as you
may warn, I'll come.
I feel very safe here, Jai.
Are you scared?
- Scared? Munna!
I feel like scorpions and snakes
running all over me on seeing him.
Don't know why he makes phone calls
and when he would barge into my flat?
I switch off lights in my flat and
make him believe I'm not there.
I'm out somewhere.
He's the right man for you,
settle down with him.
I've been asking you so many times,
why don't you marry me?
It isn't that Janu, for marriage,
you must feel like getting married.
I don't have it.
- Why don't you have it?
Why don't I've it?
How am I to explain? But I've to.
Jahnavi, we both grew up together
with Dada from childhood,
when I see you I feel like a family...
Please don't say feel like sister,
I'll jump out from here to death.
No, please don't die.
Don't die.
Take bath here everyday, be happy.
I'll give 35 acres of my land
for your new project, Jai.
But I've to get few approvals
from Govt. Will you get it?
Talk about business with Bhagawan.
Tell me if you face any problems.
Aren't the paying salaries properly,
they're shouting slogans.
Not for salaries but for killing trees
because of my factory in Midnapore.
Trees?
There's no one to care if humans die,
are there people to worry about trees too?
If you take care of it...
- If told Narsing will take care.
Come.
There's some trouble before Omega office,
come with your boys and clear it.
Shut down the factory!
What happened?
Just now remembered
something I need to do.
Come, I'll also join you.
- You carry on, I'll join you.
Okay.
Shut down the Omega factory!
Shut down the Omega factory!
Me?
Shut down...
Do you know there are no rains?
It's summer, right?
No, monsoon is not coming in time.
We'll not budge till that
bandicoot shuts it down.
Save trees!
Just a minute, I'll come back.
Where are you going?
Hold the placard high!
Okay... keep doing it.
Shut down the factory!
People are protesting outside, right?
Can't you find out their demands
and clear them out?
That is...
- This is unwanted nuisance.
You told me look after
the proposals, right?
I'll talk to Bhagawan personally.
I'll talk to him personally.
Okay?
It's lunch time,
all of you go home.
Is he sending goons?
You don't have a drop of blood in
body yet make so much noise.
What man? Will you beat me?
All of you would get beaten up,
clear out immediately.
If you beat us,
trees will take revenge on you.
How can trees take revenge?
Hey you... get the sticks boys!
Shut it down! Don't get scared!
Will you beat us?
Why did you stop?
Are you scared?
Come...
Come on beat me!
- Back off boys... go.
He got scared! Shut down the factory!
Save the green cover!
One minute! All of you please stop!
You called on phone just now, right sir?
I told you, right?
- Sir sent me.
He promised to discuss with
them tomorrow morning. - Okay.
Tell them!
Listen, sir has promised to talk
to you tomorrow morning.
You?
Get down here!
No problem.
Do you know Karan?
My gang mate... batch mate.
I didn't know he's your batch mate
and called him buffalo.
No problem.
I called him a bandicoot also.
He looks like one, right? No problem.
Can I tell you something, Sandhya?
What's it?
You look more beautiful while laughing,
why did you stop it anyway?
What do you do?
There are few little gaps between public,
private sectors and govt. Servants.
We fill those gaps.
You wanted to say something.
Me?
You said, right?
- Did I?
You did.
Where?
That is... l'll tell after coming back.
I'll be back in a sec.
What are you doing man?
What sir?
I'm not talking to you sir,
you please carry on.
You fix a deadline for anything
and complete it within that time.
Fix a deadline for this too
and complete it.
How can you fix a deadline
for this too sir?
I'm not talking to you sir,
you please carry on.
Over sir.
- Get lost!
No need. Go away!
Jai, if you like Sandhya,
tell her directly you like her.
How am I to tell her?
Say it with your mouth, you fool.
Asking me how am I to tell?
Don't ask such silly questions,
if you can't tell her,
then tell her I'm busy and
can't roam like this.
That's all but you...
Why did you take so much time?
Sandhya, now...
where shall we go now?
How am I to tell her?
How am I to show the love in me?
How am I to stop the flow of Godavari
in dusty desert of my life?
How am I to believe this myth?
How am I to express my love?
I've got back my life again
with your friendship...
I don't remember even a second
from past at this moment...
Life is celebrating the
festivities of present...
This friendship is boon and
this realisation is true...
Run out of words to express this...
Sweetness in my language...
Greenery in my path...
A smile as innocent as a child...
You've induced my life
to join your life...
And be companion for
the journey of this life...
I'm ecstatic with those feelings...
Did you say something now?
No.
I felt like you said something.
Did you hear it?
Did you say anything?
- No... no...
How could she hear it?
Ashok brother!
When did you come?
- Just now dear.
Couldn't you've taken the keys
from Chatterjee uncle's house?
No problem, anyway you'll be back, right?
Give me the bag.
- No, give it.
What's the news?
Nothing, Sambasiva's case adjournment.
It seems someone is helping
from Govt. Side.
How are you doing?
Is Chatterjee looking after you well?
I'm fine brother.
I want to meet grandma.
I feel like going back to home.
You can come dear, don't rush.
Grandma gave this pickle for you.
Pack my bag, I've to go out.
Did you buy these yourself?
Won't it look odd if others
buy it for us?
Did you buy it for yourself?
- For myself only!
Since how long you've been
wearing these clothes?
For an year now.
Don't you know it?
For a year? I've never seen this earlier.
Keep it out, I've to go out.
You've changed completely, Jai.
- Just do what I say.
Okay.
What's this?
You told me to take it out,
I've kept it ready.
Are these worn by men?
You said you'll wear it,
so I kept it ready.
These are not mine, you fool!
Whose are these?
In the shopping mall, she...
You mean... friend...
She wanted to shop so...
- Wanted to shop...
Don't repeat it.
Jahnavi too knows her.
Janu too knows her?
Jahnavi and Chandini are close friends.
So, you're saying about Chandini, right?
Who are you talking about then?
Chotu, man mustn't have so many doubts.
If he does, he'll die.
But you say Chandini,
are you serious about her?
Waved green flag.
What are you thinking?
- Nothing, my job is over here.
I've to find another nursery to work.
You said there's no nursery
like this in Kolkata, right?
Have you forgotten it?
Why not?
On Ras Behari road, it you take left,
you can find just one like this.
What's it dear?
- I think you've forgotten it.
This is Ras Behari road,
if you take a left turn...
You'll find a similar nursery, right?
- Is it?
But there isn't another one
like this, right?
Like you repeat everything,
why not this too?
No, it's closed, he gave it to
the girl who worked there.
She's running a club and
dances there.
There's a small branch is
bent outside, repair it.
You mean on the left side, right? Okay.
I said there's no other nursery like this.
Then, I'll go back to home.
I've to come to your place
to meet you, right?
Why would you feel like meeting me?
Why?
Can I ask you a thing?
Go ahead, ask.
Do you've girl friends?
Why did you ask that?
You're handsome, stylish,
There are not many reasons
for not liking you.
But I couldn't understand one thing.
Why do you always keep
an eye on watch?
Your legs never stand in one place.
As if your feet are having springs.
Those hands never come
out of the pockets.
Why?
I don't know if she's praising me
or accusing me?
How could she ask me like that?
- What sir?
I'm talking to myself,
you carry on.
How could she ask me
if I've girl friends or not?
Couldn't you've said it's you?
She says girls don't have many
reasons for disliking you.
So, she likes you or not?
Clear it yourself.
You must have 100% clarity on it.
Stand steady.
Remove your hands from the pockets.
Go and tell Sandhya that you
don't have any girl friends.
I don't have any girl friends.
Were you thinking about this inside?
Where do I've time to meet girl friends?
I'm busy always.
You?
Either you're in nursery or with me.
When are you busy anyway?
I don't have any girl friends.
She is... she is... forgot her name...
Janu... I remember now.
What are you doing here?
We were walking down,
came here for a good cup of coffee.
How come you're here?
I was going down here,
came in for a coffee.
We need to talk.
Definitely.
We need to talk!
Traffic, so...
Turned it to silent mode.
Didn't cut it, right?
What did you say?
- Please listen to me, Janu.
Excuse me... she's Jahnavi, right?
- Nothing like that...
We can discuss this.
Please listen to me.
Why should I discuss with you?
We can discuss.
How dare!
- Please listen to me.
What?
- Come here.
I've urgent work.
Don't you know my name?
Stop... who is she?
- Please listen to me.
Tell me who she is?
Will you tell me or not?
- Please listen to me.
Take a deep breathe.
Stop... why are you beating again?
Is she more beautiful than me?
Nothing... nothing...
Tell me one thing, you're refusing to marry
me because I'm a club dancer.
Shut up, I don't have such idea.
I like you Janu but for marriage...
I told you already.
It's all over, right?
I can't come in as I wish here.
Can't take bath here,
can't stay with you here.
No, nothing will change.
Got it? You'll have the same
freedom as you enjoy now.
Don't think too much and
pound your brain.
What's this sir?
I feel like stealing on seeing
so much money.
Tell me how much you've stolen?
Keep quiet sir.
I'm asking ignorantly,
where have you hidden the money?
Are you having any concubine?
No... no sir.
Am I eloping with you wife?
- Mind your language sir.
That's my money,
what bothers you if I take it?
You're just a dog under my feet.
Be like a dog.
Indeed I'm a dog, I'm loyal
so your father gave me this job.
But please don't touch money.
No sir, please don't take money.
Please go away.
Please go away from here sir.
Please go sir.
What's this sir?
- What man?
Just a kid, leave it.
Sir, please talk to Munna,
he may change his attitude.
You should be taking care of him
but what's this?
You know I don't like anything
against my son Munna.
No Bhagawan,
please talk Munna once...
Go.
Why are you here sir?
What's your problem man?
- What happened sir?
How dare you complain
to my father about me?
What are you doing?
- Get lost! Stay out!
How dare you complain
to my father about me?
It's for your good only sir.
For my good? I know what's good for me,
who are you care about me?
Mind your business.
People are watching sir.
Leave me sir.
How dare you push me!
How dare you!
My father too never dared to touch me!
That's you... this is you!
Go and tell my father now.
Tell him Munna pissed on you.
Let me see.
If you tell, I'll kill you.
I told you when all the doors close,
a new door will open up for us.
How dare he betrays me
and escapes!
And that too goes to Kulkarni
who left me.
No use in discussing past,
let's think about the future.
Saba knows everything about
what we have and where it is.
Killing Saba is the only way.
I don't know why are you
discussing for this?
If you spare a betrayer,
another will dare to betray us.
I know Sabapathy was a cheat, dad.
Kill him!
Kill Sabapathy.
What are you saying?
How can we kill Saba who worked
20 years loyally for us?
Do you want to spare him?
Will you enter Kulkarni's area?
Can you come back alive from there?
Can you come back alive
from Black square area?
Tell me who many are going there,
I'll keep graves ready for them.
Are you scaring us?
I've told you dad, if you keep such jokers,
you and your business are done.
Jai, you know very well from which
level we've reached this position.
In a dilapidated room,
after a night's sleep on waking
up next morning,
we spent our lives amongst
bandicoots which ate us alive,
I don't like to go back to
those days because of him,
kill him!
No dada!
Will you go or not?
Will you go or not?
I'll go but I'll not kill him.
I'll bring Saba, ask him
why did he do like this?
If he had done any mistake, kill him.
I'll not stop you.
Got a phone call that
my grandma is not well,
so I'm going to Palasa.
Why didn't you put on the seat belt?
Seat belt?
Leave me, you know who my father is?
You know who Kulkarni is.
- I know. Your father is my friend.
Who is he?
- Sampath's son.
I'm going there to bring Saba.
I got it.
Keeping him as hostage you'll
enter his area to bring Saba.
He's insurance for your life.
That's it, right?
Today is his birthday, celebrate it.
How old are you?
- Why?
Tell me.
- Jai is coming sir.
Let him come.
Come... come Jai.
Only you've the guts to enter my area.
How is Bhagawan?
Is he scared or angry?
I'm not coming from Bhagawan
but from a small birthday party.
Where is Rahul?
Today is his birthday,
he's partying with his friends.
Why?
What have you done with him?
Stop Sampath!
Where is Rahul?
Where is Sabapathy?
Tell me where is Rahul?
What have you done with Rahul?
- Rahul is safe.
I'll make a call, talk to him.
I don't believe it.
I know how smart you are!
Tell me where he is, I'll send my man.
Once Rahul leaves that place,
you can go with Saba.
Will you play strip Poker?
- What's that game?
If you win the game, I'll undress.
If I win, you must get undressed.
If I win all the games,
I'll undress to skin.
Where is Jahnavi?
- She hasn't yet come here.
Who is he?
- Munna, Jai has gone for Saba.
Who is he?
Sampath's son.
Jai left him here.
Sampath's son?
Today is his birthday.
Why did you do like this, Sabapathy?
What had really happened?
What am I to tell you?
Do you want me to tell Munna
urinated on me.
He threatened to kill me
if I tell anyone about this.
Couldn't you've told me?
Munna doesn't care about his father,
I don't want to get lynched
between father and son.
Did you think about the problems
that may crop because of this?
You don't know Jai,
till now people who respected me,
if they know about this,
they'll feel pity on me,
I'm not here seeking revenge,
to safeguard my respect
and my life.
Listen to me carefully.
I'm here to take you with me.
When you have done nothing wrong,
you don't need to fear anyone.
Where is Jahnavi?
Jahnavi? Who is she?
Is she sexier than her?
Why would Jahnavi be here?
If she has time she'll be with Jai...
Will Jahnavi be with Jai?
She's having an affair with him.
You're nothing to her.
What did you say now, Guru?
Not that, something before that.
What did you say about Jahnavi?
Tell me.
Tell me. Tell me what did you say
about Jai and Jahnavi?
It's an open secret,
Jai and Jahnavi are very close...
Tell me now.
Where is Jahnavi?
Will you tell me or shall I kill you?
Guru! Where is Jahnavi?
- In Jai's flat!
By now he should've reached the place.
Not answering the call.
Still not lifting the phone.
I suspect something.
I think it's Kulkarni's phone.
He's answering the call.
If anything happens to my son,
I'll not leave you.
Catch him!
Don't leave him.
Catch him.
What happened?
Munna entered the club suddenly,
we couldn't control the situation,
he killed both Rahul and Azad.
Shouldn't you've told me that?
We don't know about the
situation there, right?
Okay, where's Munna now?
Why did you come here?
Why don't you answer my phone calls?
Why should I?
What makes you so proud!
Is it because you're sexy?
Is it because I'm after you?
Why are you in Jai's flat?
What are you doing here?
You sang that song for him, right?
Is it giving you great pleasure?
Did you do it here?
Here?
If not there?
- Get out from here.
Will you make love wherever
you find some place?
Get out!
You don't know about Jai.
Do you know him well?
I don't mind if you sleep with him.
I don't like Jahnavi.
I don't like you.
Do you feel the pain?
Is it giving you pleasure?
Come on man! I'll kill you.
What have you done with Jahnavi?
How dare she refuses me for you!
The offer you made to Jai, is it just
for him or we too can avail it?
What's this Jai?
Do you know what have you done?
You killed Munna.
Bhagawan will not leave you.
See what has he done,
he bashed Jahnavi to death.
No use Jai, Bhagawan will not leave
if he knows you killed Munna.
He'll kill you.
Will Bhagawan leave me?
I'll go to him myself.
He'll kill you.
If I run scared, what I've done
will become a mistake.
Bhagawan must know
what has happened here.
I'm going to meet Bhagawan.
You stay here.
Remove your car.
It seems you killed Munna.
Don't say anything without
knowing the matter, Narsing.
I want to talk to Bhagawan,
remove your car.
Bhagawan has ordered
to kill the murderer of Munna.
You can't escape Jai,
wherever you may go, you're dead.
Like he was my shadow,
I said he'll be your shadow too.
I trusted he will be.
But I didn't expect he would kill you.
Why are you leaving this place?
Why are Bhagawan's men after you?
Kill them.
Leave it.
- Why should I?
They've killed Jahnavi,
now they're after your life,
before they kill you,
you kill them. Go, kill them Jai.
If I go there only one of
we two would be alive,
I'll be there, Bhagawan will die.
I can never do that, Chotu.
You don't know Chotu,
there's a war going on in my heart.
I'm fighting myself.
I can't stand before Bhagawan.
He may have forgotten the help he
gave for my sister and mother.
But I've not forgotten it.
I must give my life for his help.
I mustn't take his life.
He knows the value of life.
I know how to seek revenge.
I'll not leave him.
I'm not leaving fearing death,
I don't want to kill him, so I'm going.
I owe an explanation to
three people only.
One is Jahnavi, next is you,
and Sandhya.
Go.
Where?
Go far away from here.
Keep this with you.
- No, Jai.
Don't send me away.
It's not right for you to stay here.
Go.
I don't have anyone in this world.
I'll live and die for you only, Jai.
Don't send me away from you.
You always repeat my words, right?
Say I'm leaving.
As you wish. I'll go.
Go.
I didn't expect you'll come to me.
Why wouldn't I come?
You made a blind offer to Jai,
but he refused,
I'm not Jai to refuse
such tantalizing offer.
I'm Guru.
Shall we sit and discuss?
The matter is I've the opportunity,
you've a necessity,
if we both join,
it's profit all the way.
Your profit depends on the
information you give.
I'm sure it'll be more
than your expectation. - Okay.
The soft place where if you hit
Bhagawan's business will fall,
and whom you've to hit to
get the business to you,
I know very well when
and whom to strike,
but it needs a lot of ground work,
you've to be little patient.
What happened?
- Got the car.
His whereabouts are unknown.
I've our men in every place
he may go to.
Where would he go?
Shall I serve sambar?
- No.
Aren't we all here to look
after grandma?
Why did you come here unannounced?
It was shown on MAA TV cooking program.
- I said no!
Thick skinned lady!
Can't you hear I'm talking to her?
Always talking about TV programs.
- I'll not serve you.
Why are you scolding Lakshmi sister
for my sake?
Say sister-in-law!
- Sister-in-law!
I felt like meeting you all.
No, I called her.
What do you say?
Will you keep shut?
Shut up.
Dear, situation isn't good here.
We fear when Sambasiva will be out
on bail or break out from jail.
What you say is right, Ashok.
Anyway she's here,
she'll stay for a couple of days.
Will you keep her away
all life in fear?
How come you're connected
to this? Don't interfere.
It was my mistake for allowing
you to stay here.
Who are you to allow me to stay here?
This is my grandma's house.
I'm here to help out of sympathy.
Isn't it, grandma?
Tell me the truth.
He's my aunt's son,
I left home to date him.
I'm scared he may settle down
with some fair skinned lady.
What bothers you if
I go with some woman?
I'm in love with you from 8th class.
I won't accept if you go after
any other woman.
Grandma, if you don't control her,
I'll kill her.
Tell him to marry and then kill me,
I'm waiting for 2 years now.
Some more years and
I'll feel shy even to tell my age.
I don't want anything,
my stomach is full.
Can't you come down
and tell me that?
I'm coming.
Why did you call me now?
What?
Sandhya, someone is here for you.
Grandma, he's Jai, she's my grandma.
Greetings madam.
Brother Ashok. Lakshmi sister.
- Greetings. - Sister-in-law!
I worked in his nursery in Kolkata.
- What did you do?
He helped m a lot there.
- How much?
Why didn't you tell me about him?
Come in Jai.
No problem, I'll stay out.
- Stay out? - Yes.
Then do one thing, after going out,
turn left, and go straight,
and then if you turn right,
you'll see a Nookalamma temple
on your right side,
there's a big 5 star hotel next to it,
you can stay there!
Then what grandma? He's our guest
and wants to stay out.
It's not respect to allow a guest to
stay out with such a palatial home.
You can stay here happily.
Grandma.
- Show him the room.
Why another room?
He'll stay with me in my room.
When will you tell me that?
- Shut up, I'll kill you.
You come.
Come in.
This is my bedroom.
Please sit down.
Sit.
No problem, sit down.
Just now I called you and
it was switched off.
Is it? Please sit down.
Drinking water.
Glass would be enough.
If you feel thirst at night, it may be
difficult to get glasses. That's why.
Sit down, you carry on.
I had kept it somewhere here only...
- What are you searching?
That's what I'm searching, right?
Is it here?
- No, not there.
You carry on talking.
I'm not listening. You talk.
Sister-in-law!
If you stay here, I'll call you as sister.
Don't do it, all my efforts
would go waste. Talk freely.
Come quickly.
What brings you here suddenly?
I didn't respond to your phone call, right?
I came here to tell that
I've lost my phone.
If you had lost the phone
how did you know I made a call?
Got caught again.
Nice phone, lost it at the right time.
If you run so fast, you'll reach
Kolkata faster than the bus.
Why did you run now?
Memories chased me.
I didn't get you.
I was seven then, when my mother
and sister called me,
on green grasslands like this,
I used to run and fly kites,
I remembered that.
- Is it?
If you see our weekly market,
you'll recollect more memories.
Shall we go?
How is Chotu?
- He's fine.
What would happen in a day?
Anything can happen.
Lives change in minutes.
You know that?
What man? Are you trying to kill
SI Papa Rao with a tractor?
If I had that intention,
I would've done it.
I wouldn't have applied the brakes.
I know.
I know you think Ashok is a great man!
But you don't know about me.
If I open the bottle and
drink the last peg,
it'll be destruction 2012!
You can't bear it.
Let's go to the market,
it's time for collection.
Oh you? Are you fine?
- Fine.
Who is he sitting next to you?
Is he troubling you?
If he's troubling you, I'll lock
him up and break his bones.
I haven't yet got in.
Stop... stop...
- Uncle... uncle... come fast please.
Please help me.
- Please stop the vehicle.
I beg you, please give me your hand.
- Come.
Hop on...
Will you move little please?
Little more please.
You're so thin, but where did you
get so much strength?
He goes forjog.
- Jog?
Jogging wont power hands,
leg power will increase.
Did Ashok tell you not to speak?
Basically I'm a good man.
Most of them misunderstand me.
I wanted to make the village greynary.
It's greenery not greynary.
Greenery!
Greynary, it's not greynary!
Greenery!
- Greynary!
Fool! You can't pronounce it.
- Why are you getting irritated?
I just repeated what you said.
You're finding mistakes, what do you do?
I've been searching for you only.
Cell phone is switched off,
door is locked,
man has escaped,
I was searching where would he be?
What's that look?
It seems you've killed someone.
It seems they're searching for you.
If I file such an FIR and lock you up,
you're finished.
So, listen to me,
come to station and
repair the transformer.
Sir, if you don't mind, a small matter.
- Tell me.
Why sorry?
For this.
Where is he?
- Uncle is always like this.
This is our market, this is our
Shoppers Stop, City Centre, and everything.
Look at this, mud bangles.
Don't get it often.
Aren't they fine?
Will you help me wear it?
Come.
I don't like all this.
- No problem.
Stand here.
What's this Sandhya?
Why are you standing just like that?
Give a pose like him.
Like him...
Not like that.
Like him!
Stylishly!
What happened? You said fun, right?
Break it Shiva...
Come.
Jump!
Is it Krishnashtami today?
- No, this is our village's casino.
One who breaks will get
the money in it.
Will you make a try?
- No please.
You won't get such games
in your place, try it. - No please.
What's this Jai?
Ashok brother is asking you to try.
Why don't you try it for fun?
- I can't break it.
Do it for my sake.
Come Jai.
Give it.
- Okay brother.
Take it, make a try.
Let me if you can break it,
blindfold him.
Tie it perfectly.
- I'll tie it tightly.
Do you think he'll break it?
Break it Jai!
Don't just watch,
you must break it, Jai.
What are you looking at?
- I've a doubt. Can I ask?
Ask.
You appear innocent like a child but
you've many arts hidden inside you.
That's okay, ask me
what's your doubt?
I didn't expect you'll break it one shot.
Anybody can do it,
it's just timing. Even you can do it.
Nothing like that,
you've learnt Karate, right? - Little.
I guessed it.
Breaking bricks and
running cars over palms,
and breaking stone slabs on body,
will you do all this?
Long time ago.
How are you?
I'm fine, how are you doing?
- I'm fine.
Is Jai fine?
- He's fine.
Jai wanted to tell you something,
did he tell you?
Is it?
Why didn't you come here?
I've returned to my place.
Are you not in Kolkata now?
- No.
Why? Why did you leave the nursery?
I...
What happened suddenly?
I'll talk to him.
- Just a minute Chotu.
Are you fine, Jai?
- Fine, how about you?
Didn't you tell anything with Sandhya?
Not yet.
- Please don't tell.
20 years dream is standing before you.
Don't destroy it with one truth, leave it.
Forget the past.
Start life afresh.
Please don't tell anything with Sandhya.
Bye Jai.
I'm offering these lamps since
8th class wishing to marry Ashok.
Never imagined this...
It isn't a dream...
You've come like good times...
Just think and appears
before to excite you...
I'm here like a shore coming up...
If two of us merge into one,
it's love...
If our eyes see one thing and
breathe as one, then it's we...
Tell me... tell me...
Who appointed you?
- Chotu sir.
I don't know anything sir.
Find out who else used to visit here.
There's lot about him
which I don't know.
Brother Ashok!
You're dead today.
Beat him.
Break open the door and get her out.
I'll kill you first and then go after her.
I told you not to come here
from Kolkata.
Have you understood why?
Please calm down.
- You shut up.
Who are you?
How could you beat a man like that?
You would also beat like that
had you been in my place?
When someone comes to help,
don't ask for reasons.
If we've to avoid such attacks again,
we must kill Sambasiva tonight.
I'm sure SI Paparayudu would
know about Sambasiva.
If we get him drunk, he'll tell the
whereabouts of Sambasiva.
Let's ask him sir.
No need to ask that drunkard,
I'll kill him myself.
Uncle, take care of the home.
- Okay.
He used to torture farmers here to
cut trees and smuggle it from forest.
I couldn't tolerate it.
I gave them courage and
petitioned against him.
I met every one of them.
Finally arrest warrant was
issued against him.
He left threatening to kill me.
My brother Ashok forced
to go to Kolkata.
You know everything that happened after.
You're unnecessarily facing
problems because of me.
Leave this place tomorrow,
don't stay here.
His tension will be there till I'm alive.
You go away, Jai.
The reason I came here isn't that.
The reason to leave shouldn't be it.
You go to sleep.
Tonight you must have the last peg.
There will be cyclone
if I drink the last peg.
My foot cyclone, let it come,
I don't care.
I think you're busy.
You carry on, I'll come later.
Wait, is it second show to continue?
Wait.
- You wait here.
What's going on here?
What's the matter?
That is...
- My foot! What will he say?
I'll tell you.
- Tell me.
I didn't know what liquor is
till 6 months ago,
I never drank before,
but this fool made me drink last peg
and today I'm a drunkard.
If I ask why? He says cyclone
2012 will come if he drinks.
My wife... my wife ditched me.
He's the reason.
If you don't drink the last peg tonight,
I'll kill you and sit in the lock-up.
Please tell him.
- Me?
That's it! Drink it!
Now show your bloody cyclone!
Come here.
Is it okay?
Where is he?
You had last peg and
slapped him, right?
He ran away.
Did I have last peg and slapped him?
- Then what?
Did he ran away?
This side or that side?
- Straight! - Straight!
Did he go away straight?
Do you say I slapped him?
Without any doubt. I'm the witness.
Thanks at least you believed me.
What's the use sir?
I couldn't make Ashok to believe this.
When I said let's ask Paparayudu
to catch Sambasiva...
What did he say?
I can't say it sir.
- Tell me, what did he say?
He used choicest epithets.
- Epithets? What did he use?
Hey you sinner!
- Sinner!
Hey you bloody drunkard!
He said this too, sir.
Bloody drunkard!
Not only that sir, he used bad words
for me for supporting you.
Did he abuse you also?
What did he say?
He said hey you innocent!
- Innocent?
You can't even bite if finger
is placed in mouth.
He said this too sir.
Innocent. You can't even bite
if finger is placed in mouth.
The first two abuses were correct,
are you considering the second
two words also as abuses?
Forget about me, Ashok says he'll
catch Sambasiva before you can.
Is it?
Samba lives in forest besides
the elephant's waterhole,
amidst the foxes pen...
Why sorry?
Who is the new man in her home?
- He came recently.
We saw him in the market.
We thought he would've gone.
Why didn't you tell me that before?
Who is it?
Check boys, go.
Go that side.
Go this side.
Who is it?
Who is it?
What's that?
Though he only drinks...
- Thought he's just a drunkard.
Greetings sir...
Greetings sir.
You're not an ordinary man.
- What happened?
Why people have gathered here?
What's all this sir?
- What did I do?
Sir, see he did everything and
innocently asking what has happened?
Did I do anything?
To keep this place in peace, you drank
the last peg and killed Sambasiva,
are you asking innocently
what has happened? - Me?
Sir, you're God!
- Am I God?
You're God.
I'll not leave your stomach.
Sir...
- Did I kill Sambasiva? - Yes sir.
Last night you said I'll not
sleep till I see his end,
till now I saved the last peg
for him only,
tonight I'll kill him,
and usher in the
cyclone 2012 tonight, you said this.
Did I?
- Yes sir.
Do you really say I killed him?
That's what people think and
if you don't it'll be very bad.
Now listen to me carefully, sir.
You didn't kill any ordinary man,
you killed Sambasiva!
A cold blooded murderer!
A beast!
You're a hero for killing such a devil.
A great warrior!
If you don't accept or believe it,
Ashok will take all the credit,
now you're a real hero!
How could he kill Sambasiva?
Have you all gone mad?
Shut up.
Good show!
I killed Sambasiva!
Me!
I don't care if people like you
believe it or not.
My foot!
Sir.
Call the photographer.
- Come here.
Sir, please go near the body...
go near the body...
Near the body?
Lt'll be fine.
I'm going.
- Little further.
I'll not go.
Sir, little closer to the body.
Please sir.
I'll rap your head.
Little closer.
It'll be fine, little closer.
That's all.
Take a snap.
Born somewhere...
grew up somewhere else...
He came to our place...
he has become part of our family...
He's a moon without dark spots...
a shining sun of goodness...
He plays with elephants, O Paparayudu...
If every place has a man like him,
there won't be any problems...
There won't be any darkness anymore...
You stop it.
What are you doing there?
- Coming sir.
Coming sir. I'm here sir.
Why is he singing about moon,
sun, brightness and darkness?
He's singing about you, sir.
- I must understand it, right?
I came here to grey...
You're right.
You do one thing.
- Sir.
Don't use big words like him,
use small words,
you sing in praise of me.
- Me sir?
Yes, don't hesitate. Sing.
- No sir.
My shoulder broke sir.
Sing.
- Okay sir.
Sing I say!
You beat the drums!
Wastrel of all wastrels...
You foolish ass...
Drunkard... loafer...
A goon in the police uniform...
What's this sir?
Why are you beating me?
Why are you abusing me?
- In the flow... - Stop.
Though I didn't understand,
his abuses were much better.
Yours is totally worse.
Do one thing,
don't go too high or too low,
use medium abuses.
Watch now sir!
Beat!
He's short and a world hero...
He appears ordinary...
This warrior has many tricks
under his sleeve...
He's a great warrior without a
moustache, he's like a superman...
He looks very simple...
He's Lord Anjaneya who doesn't
know his own strength...
He's Ghajini's cousin to forget
every good deed he does...
Next?
What next? Beat!
Don't judge people by the
clothes and looks...
At the right time one's stamina
comes to the fore...
Though he doesn't have
a six pack body...
Paparayudu's single hand
can do wonders...
Though he may look like
a comedian in cut outs...
This short man's razor sharp
eyes can kill anyone...
Can knock-out anyone...
Next?
- What next? Beat!
Watch now brother!
How about this brother?
Change the movement.
That's fine!
Ladies too joined him.
Till yesterday people here were
grinding axe on you...
Now they're ready to offer their
daughters in marriage...
Till yesterday you were nothing...
today you're a sir...
People who chided you
are bowing to you in honour...
You're God and judge to any problem
in the surrounding villages...
Even if they fall at your feet,
don't ever leave anyone...
If you're not with us as protector,
who would protect us?
Sir... sir...
I'm here sir.
This land is mine,
this village is mine...
People of this village are my people.
I'll not leave you.
- That's enough sir.
Like gum... like adhesive...
I'll stick on to this place.
Sir, you're God!
Bless him sir.
Sir...
Its enough of this life.
- Go.
Enough of it sir.
- Go.
No sir. - Go I say!
- I'm going sir.
Beat!
Little slow!
Still slower!
Slower than it.
Further slow is nothing.
Nothing can be heard.
Beat!
Let's install a golden statue
when he's still alive...
Let's spread message of Paparayudu's
good deeds around...
Let's celebrate his birthday
like a festival of Deepavali or Holi...
And call it as Papavali...
Let's collect donations and
build a marble temple for him...
Let's make Paparayudu's epic tale
a lesson in school text book...
Next?
- What next? Beat!
Sir, got excited...
- What's this? Go... go away...
What did I tell and
what were you doing?
If you don't tell the truth,
all of them would be burnt alive.
Where is Chotu? Tell me.
Where is Chotu?
I really don't know.
He left this place.
I'll tell you...
I don't know where he is
but he calls me sometimes.
Call him on phone.
Just a minute. Got a phone call.
Hello, my life!
Where are you Chotu?
- Are you thinking of me?
Do you want to meet me?
- Yes, I want to meet you.
I can't come.
You know... small problem.
If you insist I too feel like meeting you.
Do one thing.
There's Dreamland hotel
outside the city.
Let's meet there coming Thursday.
Will you bring it or shall I bring it?
I'll bring it.
Don't tell anyone. Bye.
One Beer to room number 108.
6She's very fast.
Tell me, where is Jai?
I don't know dada.
Do you really don't know
or refusing to tell me?
I refuse to tell though I know.
If you tell me where's Jai,
it'll be easy to catch him,
if not it'll be little difficult.
I told you I'll not tell.
That's it?
Tell me now!
If you had told me
death would've been easier.
You know what should be done, right?
We'll find and kill him.
I didn't tell you to kill him,
I want Jai alive.
A small gift for you.
- For me? - See!
I want to tell you something.
You don't have to tell me, I know it.
Sandhya, i want to tell...
- Isn't it that the place you love?
Your dreamland.
Actually from that place to
this end belongs to us.
But my father gave to the villagers.
Sandhya, Paparayudu didn't kill Sambasiva.
What?
I killed him.
For you.
There's another Jai whom you don't know.
After my father's death,
me, my mother and my sister
came to Calcutta for livelihood.
When people were looking at
my mother and sister with desire,
I was dying in fear
how to protect them.
I came with dreams of
looking after mother well,
and marry off my sister
in a good family,
when people killed them
after molesting them,
my heart broke, Sandhya,
console to a man in grief,
courage to a man in fear,
help to a helpless man,
people don't get such comforts easily,
but I got everything
with just one touch,
Bhagawan!
Kill!
Putting value to help,
marking boundary to gratitude,
is like killing humans,
gratitude isn't just thinking of the help,
it's showing gratitude to
the man who helped us.
Why are you telling me everything, Jai?
Why are you telling now?
Are you asking me not to love you?
Are you saying you don't love me?
Why?
You gave me love which
I had lost years ago.
That's why.
Though I didn't commit any mistake,
I can't cheat you by hiding truth.
That's why I'm telling you.
I like you, I love you from my heart.
Though the life I dream
is before my eyes,
to take into my arms...
Why are you stopping yourself, Jai?
Why?
Don't think I'll forget if you refuse me.
I loved you, I love you,
I'll keep loving you.
As far as my life is concerned,
whether it is dream or reality,
it's you Jai.
I loved you, I love you,
I'll keep loving you.
As far as my life is concerned,
whether it is dream or reality,
it's you Jai.
Are you dead or alive?
You would also do the same
if you were in my place,
let's discuss about it later.
My Rahul died because of you, die!
Give me the phone. - What happened?
- Give me phone.
Where are you?
- Why?
What happened to Sandhya?
- Give me car keys.
What happened to Sandhya?
You would've understood
what's my background.
Give me car keys.
I'll also come with you.
This is my war, the last war
I'm waging for my sake.
Come!
Where is Sandhya?
Where is Sandhya?
I don't know who Sandhya is!
If you don't know how could
Sampath trace me out.
Guru told us.
Guruvaiah?
You didn't like my offer,
Guru accepted it.
Guru planned this.
Guru told us to kill you also.
Call him on phone.
Call him on phone!
Did you kill Jai?
Stop... I didn't do this.
I'm Guruvaiah, Jai!
Where is Sandhya?
- I don't know.
May be Bhagawan would've taken her.
Yes, Bhagawan did this.
To catch you, he killed everyone.
He killed poor Chotu
by asphyxiating him.
Kill Bhagawan...
Leave me, I'm Guru.
Leave me... leave me...
do I need it at this age?
I beg you, leave me, I'll go away.
I'll never appear in public again,
take it as I'm dead.
Leave me Jai... I beg you.
Throw the gun, Jai.
Come Jai... come.
Though you knew I'm searching you,
you didn't come to me.
You've come searching for a girl.
Why? Why Jai?
How could you go away killing
Munna and leaving me?
First know why I had to kill Munna.
He was torturing and killing
Jahnavi before my eyes,
I did what any man with
humanity would do.
Munna is my son.
I trusted you'd be like his shadow.
I promised to be shadow of
humans not to sadists.
I lost my son, my honour.
I lost my power.
Jai, power is greater than one's life.
I thought you'd be mourning
the death of a son.
But you're sad about losing power.
The problem is between you and me,
leave Sandhya,
till now I've never killed anyone
without valid reason,
if I get a reason,
I'll not spare anyone.
You wanted revenge on me,
you'd no reason to kill Chotu,
now you've kidnapped Sandhya,
if there's anyone left in my life
as my own, its Sandhya.
Please leave Sandhya.
Sandhya, come.
Raising it on me...
on Bhagawan himself!
For the sake of a girl,
raising it on me,
what's there in her?
Life!
I gave you this life.
After losing your mother and sister,
you were left orphaned on streets,
I gave you the life.
There's no Jai without Bhagawan.
What did you give me in return?
20 years of my life.
For your help I gave you
20 years of my life.
Dada, you gave a gun to take lives,
but I believed its to protect lives,
till now I never talked to you but today
arguing with you, understand it,
but still I'm not here to kill you,
I'm here to take Sandhya with me,
leave Sandhya,
Dada, don't force me to kill you.
Don't force me to kill you.
You're talking to Bhagawan.
You're talking to Bhagawan's strength.
You'll regret this, Jai.
- You'll die, leave her.
Why should I leave her?
I gave you gun for my sake,
I gave you life for my sake,
I've turned you like armour
for my sake,
even if you die,
you must die for me only.
Die for my sake only.
But she has taken me away from you.
