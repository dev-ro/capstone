[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[RAINDROPS PATTERING]
[LILY] I have heard myself say
that a house with a death in it
can never again be bought
or sold by the living.
It can only be borrowed from the ghosts
that have stayed behind.
To go back and forth,
letting out and gathering back in again.
Worrying over the floors
in confused circles.
Tending to their deaths
like patchy, withered gardens.
They have stayed
to look back for a glimpse
of the very last moments of their lives.
But the memories of their own deaths
are faces on the wrong side
of wet windows,
smeared by rain.
Impossible to properly see.
There is nothing
that chains them to the places
where their bodies have fallen.
They are free to go,
but still they confine themselves,
held in place by their looking.
For those who have stayed,
their prison is their never seeing.
And left all alone,
this is how they rot.
[WOMAN] I did not know it at the time,
but the house that stands
at the end of Teacup Road
in the town of Braintree, Massachusetts,
was such a house.
[FAINT THUNDER RUMBLING]
[RAINDROPS PATTERING]
A house that holds a seat
for the memory of a death.
The staying place of a rotted ghost.
[CRICKETS CHIRPING]
At the time of my arrival
in the first part of August,
the house was occupied by Iris Blum,
the author of 13 novels.
The kinds of thick and frightening books
that people buy at airports
and supermarkets.
Of her books, I have read fewer
than nine pages of only a single one...
and all the while
suppressing a very bad taste.
I am not even sure of the title.
From where I am now,
I can be sure of only a very few things.
The pretty thing you are looking at is me.
Of this I am sure.
My name is Lily Saylor.
I am a hospice nurse.
Three days ago, I turned 28 years old.
I will never be 29 years old.
[MAN] It's, uh... [SNIFFLES]
She's just above,
uh, the bedroom on the right
in the front of the house.
-Oh.
-[SNIFFLES]
[STAIRS CREAKING]
[SIGHS]
Hello, Ms. Blum.
My name is Lily.
I'm going to be staying with you
from now on. I hope that's all right.

Couldn't sleep.
The first night in a place

The phone is in the kitchen.
What do you want?
[LAUGHS]
It's got one of those

that your mom used to have.
[LAUGHS] Remember that?
[SIGHS]
Oh, well, it's a real old house, so...
I don't know.
They're thicker?

No, he hasn't called.

I can't imagine what I'd say if he did.

"Oh. Remember that time we almost

No, I don't think he will, either.

[LILY] There.
It was just there,

On my very first night in the house.
A death.
But I cannot see it.
Not yet.
But I can feel it shifting its weight
from bare foot to bare foot.
Stepping around softly
behind a curtain of dark.
Pacing back and forth
in the cage of my chest.
[SIGHS]
"Dark Moon Flower."
"Underwater Housewife."
So that's where you're hiding.
[SIGHS]

My name is Lily, Ms. Blum.
We met a few hours ago.
I'm going to be staying here with you

My Polly, tell me you missed me
just a little bit too.
You'll give me as much as that, won't you?

[SMACKS LIPS]
-And how is the lady of the house today?
-[LILY] Oh, she's comfortable.
Taking a nap,
as she usually does at this time.
And the wall, you say?
[LILY SIGHS] Yes.
It was fine when I first moved in,
but now I think it's gotten much worse
in the past few weeks.
Ah.
Hmm.
Possibly a mold of some kind.
Likely there is some plumbing
behind the wall,
-a pipe that runs up to the bathroom.
-Oh, the laundry room is just above, I--
I sometimes hear the water going up
and a kind of knocking sound.
You say you haven't seen it anywhere else?
No. Only right here.
Well... As to whether or not
the estate will approve the cost
for cosmetic repairs,
that is another thing altogether.
Oh, I'm not sure I'd agree it's cosmetic.
Well, cosmetic as opposed to structural.
The flesh and not the bones.
Well, I just thought
that for Ms. Blum's respiratory--
[SIGHS] For my respiratory to be...
breathing mold.
Mm-hm.
Well, as you know,
it is Ms. Blum's stated desire
to remain in this house
until the occasion of her death
and that all medical care be provided
here on the premises regardless
of financial burden to the estate.
And you've been here
nearly a year already.
Oh...
Well, given her advanced age
and present condition,
it seems fair to assume
that your arrangement
would not extend beyond
another year or two at maximum,
wouldn't you say?
Overall, I'd say her physical health
is rather good.
Um, so, I'm sure I couldn't say.
[CHUCKLES]
No, no. Of course. Of course.
That's... good.
Uh, but, um...
Isn't she all there is to the estate?
[CHUCKLES] She doesn't have any children,
no family.
[SIGHS] Not a single visitor
in all the time I've been here.
True, but Ms. Blum
has designated the property
as the centerpiece for a grant foundation
to be awarded after her death
to a worthy woman author
as a home and work space at no cost.
"House of Stories," she calls it.
Well, it'll have to be fixed up then,
for whoever. [LAUGHS]
Well, it will be, when the time comes.
But the estate can't pay for everything.
Oh, here we are.
They've been out in the past
and will give us a better idea.
-Was there anything else?
-No.
Oh...
yes.
Hmm... [SIGHS]
Uh, do you know anything
about anyone named Polly?
Polly? Polly who?
[SIGHS]
Ms. Blum insists on calling me Polly.
She never calls me anything else.
[LAUGHS]
Uh, of course, it's a natural thing
for someone with her condition.
It's just that a confusion like that
is usually with the memory
of someone significant.
Not just a no one.
Well, there is Polly
from Ms. Blum's novel,
The Lady in the Walls.
Oh.
Easily her best known.
You haven't read it.
Oh, heavens to Betsy, no, I haven't.
[LAUGHS]
No, um, I scare too easily. I...
Oh, yes, that's right.
Well, there is a not-very-good movie,
if you prefer.
No. Uh, no.
That would be much, much worse.
[LAUGHS]
I'd likely run down to the road screaming.
And who'd look after Miss Blum? [LAUGHS]
That particular novel was most notable
for Ms. Blum's deliberate choice...
to leave off
the presumably horrific ending.
Though she always insisted
it wasn't a choice at all,
but rather an obligation.
An obligation to be true to the subject.
To Polly.
I don't understand.
Well, I don't want to give it away.
But, Mr. Waxcap, I--
[LAUGHS] I'll never read it.
-[BRIEFCASE LOCK CLICKS]
-I'd hate to keep you.
[SIGHS]
[LILY] The house was built in 1812
by the two bare hands of a local man,
as a gift to his new bride.
The couple was last seen
taking their marriage vows
in the center of town.
And the very next day, they were gone...
disappearing before placing
a single piece of furniture.
The townspeople shook their heads
and clucked their tongues.
"Some people," they'd say,
"just get spooked."
[SIGHS]
Well, well.
You're not so big and tough.

[LILY, READING] "Dear Reader,
You should know that the true account
that follows in this book
was told to me directly by Polly Parsons,
the young woman who lived it
but, alas, did not survive it.
True to our heroine, my heroine,
I have written down
all that she cared to reveal.
All but the very ending,
which she was either unable
or unwilling to tell me herself.
Or maybe
she just couldn't see it anymore."

"And even if I was fiendishly tempted,
I have refrained
from pressing the subject with her.
Though it seems safe to assume
that, as endings go,
Polly's was not an especially pretty one.
But Polly wouldn't tell me herself,
and I couldn't have gone
and simply made something up.
So I have left it off altogether.
Out of respect for the dead,
you understand.
Because yes, dear reader,
Polly Parsons, the subject of this book,
is quite dead indeed.
Quite dead but not quite buried.
Carelessly concealed in a grave
too shallow to be rightly called
a grave at all.
Better to call it a... hiding place.
But I've said too much already,
and now will leave the rest
to Polly herself,
