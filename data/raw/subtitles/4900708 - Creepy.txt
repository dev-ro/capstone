I hate giving up without trying
It's definitely best to put it into action
We must do our best in that case
In what aspect?
In every aspect.
There must be a sense of accomplishment
Even if it's a crime?
I didn't say that.
Mr detective you are an asshole.
Sorry
I can differentiate btn right and wrong.
So Mr Matsuoka is a
man of principles
Yes
You might not believe it.
I have my principles
It might be hard for
the police to understand
Yes, it's a pity.
Mr Policeman
Can I have a cigarette?
You must be joking, of course not.
I haven't smoke for a whole week
Takakura senior
I will send Matsuoka
to the detention center
I would like to speak to him.
Can't be done.
He has to be handed over to the prosecutor
Nogami，he is completely psychotic.
What a rare case this is.
He killed eight people
He can only be an idiot.
Just give me one more day.
I have alot of questions for him.
Suspect escaped!
The perp has a weapon.
What are you doing? Stop right now.
Let her go.
Hey, let me do the negotiation.
Mr detective, i have to thank you.
Matsuoka, your actions are futile.
You will not escape.
Is that right?
If i don't try i won't know.
Nogami, firearms down.
You think about it
You are calling the shots now.
You can have anything you want.
But if you hurt the hostage.
The priviledge that you now hold.
will disappear.
I thought you are a man of principles?
Hand over the fork.
Are you preparing to grab the fork?
I will never do that.
Do you dare to back face me?
Why not?
You really dare to
Now you are looking at a man of principles.
To emergency room, quick.
Takakura senior, you okay?
Do i place this in the kitchen, Yasuko?
Yes, just place it there.
Ill be tying Marcus outside.
Thank you.
You'll be living
outside from today onwards.
Haven't had time to
rest for several years.
That's a long time.
It's the best to be relax.
Isn't quitting the police force good?
Yes
Is everything fine with teaching
at the university?
It's interesting to talk to the students.
I am quite suitable to be a lecturer.
Then I am very glad
Lets continue to tidy up.
Don't forget this before dark.
What's this for?
A present for the neighbours.
Coming
Hi, we just moved into the unit below
I am Takakura
Hello
Please look out for us in the near future.
I will
This is a token of appreciation.
We do not exchange
gifts with the neighbours
The formalities are a hassle.
She is my mom, she is sick.
That's sad to hear.
Yasuko, we are leaving.
Please lookout for us.
Lets go next door
You press it.
Me?
We will come again.
as we enter the twentieth century
almost every country in the world
There exist the presenceof
serial murderers.
It is a modern form of criminal plague.
With america at the epicentre
Criminal psychological analysis
developed rapidly
It can be differentiate into 3 categories.
They are pattern, random
And hybrid patterned with randomness
The FBI have a firm grasp of
the first 2 categories
and it's detailed criminal characteristics
This type of killer identification
rate increased significantly
The problem lies in the hybrid
They are nearly impossible to analyse
regardless of their motive to kill
or cycle of repetition and relevance
It can be very confusing
during the police investigation.
Theres several serial
murder cases that i am in
that are of the hybrid kind
That means, the theory of criminal analysis
or the FBI scientific research are no help
Okawa, can I ask you a question?
Yes
After the lecturer finish the lecture
Usually what do they do?
Indulge in research of
respective areas of expertise.
Oh right.
Then, what are you doing?
I am categorising
the homicide cases of Kanto
region in 10 years
Wow
Amazing
Okay
What is this case about?
Nakamachi robbery murder case, solved
How about this?
Aoba-cho random murder case, solved
This happened quite far away?
Hino City,disappearance of a family of 3
Unsolved
Oh, Hino city case.
It took place about six years ago
Mr Honda Yohei and wife Kyoko
and eldest son Yousuke
The disappeared at the same time.
Didn't you handle that
case Professor Takakura?
I didn't participate directly.
But why is it a muder case?
Not sure.
The youngest daughter was found.
Honda Hayakawa, 2nd grade that year.
Oh i remember,
Her testimony was inconsistent
she was determined unfit to testify
Do you know where she lives now?
I don't know, it is not here in the files.
Is there a photo of
the home surrounding?
No
Oh
Would professor Takakura
like to visit the crime scene?
Huh?
I always wanted to see
a real detective doing crime
scene investigation.
Please, i am not a detective anymore
Whats that?
Sorry, I thought nobody was home
I am Takakura, i just moved in yesterday.
Please accept this token of appreciation
I am asking you what's that?
It's chocolate
Chocolate?
Those luxurious sweets thats 1000 yen each?
Is it those chocolate?
Not those kind
If so,
I am sorry
I do not hate chocolate
Please accept
Do you have a dog?
Yes, i do.
I love dogs too.
I will keep my dog in check.
You will keep the dog in check?
Yes
Theres no need for that.
If you feel the dogharrassing
you, please do tell.
Alright
Please do lookout for us
That's the honda house.
Where is it?
The brown roof building right
next to the railway.
do you sense of criminal activity?
I won't know at this distance
Seems like an empty house
Is there anything out of place?
Can't tell yet.
Should we go in?
Well, we shouldn't be too involved.
I am home
welcome home.
I am busy at the moment
Thats fine
The lights are on in the Nishino
family home next door
Should we say hello?
Alright.
It's a tad late, we will go next time.
It's done
Amazing, it's a feast.
I can do alot with the ingredients we have
that's delicious
That's great.
What happen today, Yasuko?
It's nothing really.
what is it.
Nishino, our next door neighbour
doesn't seem too friendly
How's that?
Totally ignores everything i say
Should say he is a wierdo
or he has a very cold temperament
Theres all kinds of people out there.
But most of the bad guys
appears to be decent people
in their neighbourhood
If you see it from this
point of view, it's safe
What are you talking about?
The killer lead 4 prostitutes into the room
put on handcuffs and rape them
then ferry them on a private
plane to a secluded mountain
and left them in the forest
subsequently, he hunted them with a rifle
It's really on a different scale in america
It's been a long time, Takakura senior
You actually found me here
Yes i can be at ease
upon knowing that you are well.
Have your wounds healed?
Yes
I've called you several times
did you changed your number?
Yes
That explains
Any chance you don't want to see me?
We don't have anything to talk about.
Theres something we need to talk about
Takakura senior, i understand you visited
the Hino city crime scene
Your news sure travels fast.
I am still a police afterall
why are you there?
Thank you.
I did go to the Hino city crime scene
I am very concerned ,why
is there no sign of a crime
but its categorise as a murder case
the disappearance of the 3 in the family
might be to hide from debtors
but a little girl was left behind
I can't think of any reason
and she was determined to not have
the capacity to testify
Thats right
Why is she the only one left behind?
did the police do a phychoanalysis on her?
Most probably not
she was only a
secondaryschool student then
A secondary school kid is not a baby.
If you were incharge then...
a detective with psychoanalysis background
there was only you at that time
that's why it lead to the failure
Let's just forget it
Sorry
Would you like to meet her?
the police had stop investigating the case.
Can't even summon her to the
station for interragation anymore.
If i want to meet her privately
she won't see me.
but you do have a chance
Nogami, should we return to
the scene of the crime first.
There is clearly a problem
There's the unique scent of a crime scene
Ah right, wait a minute
Marcus, stop
Sorry
Come quick
Marcus come
Marcus
I like dogs but he is very aggressive
very sorry about that
it's alright
Come
are you alright
Madame
i am very sorry yesterday
its alright
My attitude was not very nice
please don't mention it
people in this neighbourhood generally
mind their own business
we don't interact with the neighbours
I've become that way too
ah okay
i will be mindful of myself
did you make those chocolate?
yes, you figure it out.
of course, they are delicious.
oh really? thats great.
please lookout for me in the future.
likewise, likewise
my daughter
hey
i have a daughter and wife
i am home
Welcome home, this is
our neighbour Mrs Takakura
Hello, I am Nishino Mio
Hello
He is Marcus
Hi, how are you.
Marcus is very happy
the dog seems to like Mio
maybe ill meet your wife next time
what do you mean?
nothing in particuliar
is there anything out of the ordinary?
No there isn't
Mio, your mom is waiting for you.
this is my first time here
this is really wierd...
you feel this is way out of place too?
thats right, how do i put it
a special feeling specific to crime scenes
excuse me, are you miss Honda Saki?
we are not with the police
are you reporters?
no, i am professor
Takakura from Togaku University
He is?
I am Norizaku Nogami
I teach ciminal psychology
for the academic view of
the crime scene investigation
miss honda, why are you here?
because i lived here in the past.
but it had been over 6 years
sorry, i dont have anything to say
please, just spare us a bit of your time
miss honda, if you need help
feel free to approach me
to seek the truth would be too ideal
but that is what we are after
don't you want to know?
what exactly happen 6 years prior?
goodbye
please hold on
she must have been hounded by
the police and media
asking about ridiculous things
yes
but why did she come back here?
Mr Takakura?
So it is Mr Takakura
I am your neightbour Nishino
Hello, how are you?
What is with your wife?
she keeps asking about my private affairs.
I feel very bothered
why are you checking on others?
so sorry
we live in a small social circle
if we can't trust the neighbours
how can we continue living on here?
I will talk to her
My family is a bit more informal
Is there anything she finds annoying?
No, I'm really sorry
please, you seem trustworthy
that's why i am here to talk to you
if i don't
what might be the outcome?
thank you for your time.
digging in
whats bothering you?
the nextdoor neighbour
mr Nishino is being ridiculous
you think that too?
i met him while returning home
and he scolded me.
what did he say?
some inexplicable words
is it about marcus?
no, its mundane issues,i
forgot what is it about.
don't take it to heart
if theres any problem
i have alot of friends in the police force
i think we should stop interacting
with the neighbours
don't look for trouble
coming
i called yesterday
Togaku University Professor Takakura
excuse me, is miss Honda Saki in?
she is not around
oh okay
she doesnt live here, stop coming.
Grandma, is it alright
I am sorry, we will talk below.
alright
In truth, i don't quite remember the events
during the time the family disappear
i have a very vague memory
of the whole episode
alright
but recently
i remember some fragments
i am not sure how much truth is in it
but at least 10% should be the truth
the process of reaffirming memories
is quite interesting
interesting?
sorry
its my guilty pleasure
to mix my work with hobby
do you treat this as a hobby?
yes
but i am very serious about it
auntie how are you?
hello, you got off from school?
who is that?
I am Takakura
i made too much buttered vegetable
stew yesterday
do you want some?
please take this
this will leak
please give it to your wife
would you like to see my wife?
is she home?
she is, please come in
thank you
excuse me
please come in
is there any problem?
no
please come in
Mio, Mrs Takakura is here
she would like to see your mom
she does not have many friends
if she talk to your mom,
she would be very happy
i will bid farewell for today
why?
my husband will be home soon
your husband
looks exceptional
we had a conversation by the road
he must charm alot of ladies
nothing of that sort, i got to go.
vegetable stew
forgot about that
sorry to bother
thank you
Mrs Takakura
please do meet my wife the next time
she came down with psychological
problem long time ago
it is depression
i cant help her
i am helpless about it
it's been a while, you can talk freely now
alrght
then lets start the voice recording
i swear that the materials gathered here
will not be shared with the police or media
or any unauthorised
disclosure be done in public
please state your name
I am Honda Saki
you mentioned you remembered
some fragments recently
some memories about the incident
that occur 6 years ago
please tell us the content
the memories leading up to the
disappearance of my family
for example?
what time was it?
it was in the day
i came back from school
mom was on the phone
the conversation was inaudible
but i am sure my mom felt fearful
she seem to have seen something
she shouldnt have
why that kind of feeling
mom did not notice i had return home
she is very engross in the conversation
rather then saying it was engross
rather its like she is being controlled
by the other end of the phone line
thats what i think
perhaps, debtors was on
the other end of the line
thats what i said to the police
Your mom borrowed money from
various financial institutions
this is the truth?
thats correct
but...
is there any problem?
on other days, while mom is on the phone
when she does not want the family
to hear, she will lower her voice
but occasionally she will
still joke around and smile
sometimes theres sound of jovial flirting
i only recalled this difference recently
might be a phone conversation
to the same person
did you tell this to the police?
no
alright
regarding your mom's other relations?
did you recall anything?
my dad is very busy with his work
he comes home very late everyday, i
dont have any impression about that
but
once i saw him having a
phone conversation late in the night
it seems to be nothing
he smiles occasionally,and
get angry occasioanlly
the other end of the phoneline
seems to be his old friend
now that i recalled
that might be the same person
mom was talking to
thats what i feel
interesting
sorry, i am listening in to it like a hobby
 am not sure why i think in that way
and my brother
did your brother made similiar phone calls?
No, my brother was a high school student
but he came back home late several times
he smelt of booze
at that point in time i thought
my studious brother
got into some bad company
but now upon rethinking the scenario
i don't think he has any delinquent friends
my brother would not dare to
drink on his own accord
there must be someone forcing him
to drink periodically
it just might be that person on the
opposite end of the phone line
it just might be
or maybe it might just be my imagination
no, you might have picked up on something
regarding that mysterious person?
do you have any other clue?
but your intuition tells you
he is deeply related to
the disappearance of your family
thats right
why did he not come in contact with you?
i have no idea
maybe i am his next target
You were fortunate to have escaped
Ah yes, 3 days prior to their disappearance
i was on a school excursion
ah okay
so the last time you seen your family
was 3 days prior to disappearance
was there anything unusual then?
i don't remember
don't remeber meaning there is a
possibility of recollection?
is there?
Professor Takakura, for the time being ....
don't interrupt me
miss Honda, please try to recollect
the memories prior to the
disappearance is the most important
do you recall any other details?
i told the police countless times.
everything was normal about them
thats all i remember
no matter how many times you
ask my answer won't change
i am sorry, i was careless...
can we stop?
alright
Professor Takakura is no difference
from the rest of them
treating living people like lab rats
i really am sorry
will she be willing to see me again?
She will take the initiative to meet us
a person who recover half her memories
will do her best to dig up the other half
no matter how painful the memories are
Professor Takakura, you are amazing
Nogami, don't be mistaken
This is my interest, not an interrogation
did you record it? let me listen.
i am home
welcome home
i made a phone call to you countless times
sorry, my phone was off
did someone visit us?
about that...
Mr Takakura,you are home.
I am teaching Mr Nishino to cook
oh is it?
why?
actually its more appropriate
to say i am teaching Mio to cook
hello i am Nishino Mio
digging in
please dig in
ill fetch some red wine
thank you
this is delicious
Mrs Takakura is a genius cook
please don't exaggerate
this is made by Mio
delicious!
Mio really do have some talent with this
Mr Nishino
teach your mom this recipe
if she is willing, she can cook this too
Mr Nishino
what is your occupation?
didn't i mention?
yes
i do administative work for an association
association administrator?
which association?
related to stocks exchange
stocks?mainly in which field of interest?
a variety, theres cheap and expensives ones
for example?
dear, isnt it rude to ask too much?
is it rude?
no its fine
but as you know
theres alot of effort put into this
it's inconvenient to speak about it openly
i don't speak about my work
infront of my wife and daughter
Mio have no interest to listen either.
i understand, sorry about that
when you come to visit the next
time,we can talk about it indept
ill show you something of interest too
sounds great, ill visit you the next time
you are welcome anytime
this is really delicious
can be eaten directly
its much more delicious in soup
really delicious
this is great
Isn't this great?
don't be this way
he is really wierd
really? i thought he is a nice person.
can't really be trusted
why?
my intuition
detective intuition?
you havent change abit
even if you are ruined in the police force
even gotten injured in the line of duty
the night before i went for the excursion
the last time i saw my family
my parents and brother were in
a discussion in the living room
i thought it was about my brother's studies
i vaguely heard the word "coincidental"
"coincidental" right?
yes
coincidentally, when i
am leaving home for a week....
it's roughly this meaning
coincidentally what were they going to do
to meet someone
alright
 i think they have someone they must meet
they scheduled for the day
when i was away
that someone must be....
that mysterious person
its a very high possibility
thereafter, it might be my imagination
but i might have met that mysterious person
who is he?
i saw that person
he kept staring at me
i have this very vague memory of it
miss Honda, do you have a
more detailed recollection about it?
detailed?
let me think
that person was looking up at me
so you were higher then where he was at?
thats right
i was looking down at
him from a vantage point
coincidentally our eyes met
that was through the windows of my room
thats right, he was standing at
the neighbours courtyard
neighbour?
who was the family beside the honda family?
let me see
It was Mr Mizuta
Mizuta? do you know him?
no i don't
was that person mr Mizuta?
i don't know
what is the condition of the
neighbour's apartment?
it was vacant for a long time.
does your family have any relationship
with your neighbour?
no, we practically don't talk to them
i don't even remember the mizuta name
thank you for your effort in recollecting
these are good reference information
is these any progress on
finding my family?
yes
are they still alive?
yes, thats a possibility
（Disappearance of Mizuta）
Scissors paper stone
one more time
please take a seat
it's alright
please take a seat first
really?
thank you very much
quick run
stop
the kids are so hyperactive
Mr Nishino
that was really coincidental
Do you take the tram often?
not really, it's to attend
association conference once a week
its tiring to take the tram
really
I used to work in an office
i commute by tram everyday
where did you work then?
Daiken publishing house business division
oh, Daiken publishing house
yes, i had left the position for 10 years
i am a lecturer at Togaku Uni
we have frequent dealings with
Daiken publishing
Mr Takakura works at Togaku Uni?
Do you know Mr Takeuchi in the
Administrative Department?
Mr Takeuchi?
the name seems familiar
he was very helpful to me during my
time at the publishing house
we still send new year greeting
card to each other
oh really? that's good to hear.
i really reminisce when we talk about this
once i had a bright future ahead of me too
goodbye
Thank you for your hospitality
the last time
it's all good
let's have a drink the next time
no problem, goodnight
good night
Yesterday at noon in the
empty house in Hino, Tokyo
we found an unknown corpse
Police are determining
the identity and cause of death
the police highlight
that the nextdoor apartment
Six years ago in 2009
there was a case of a family of
three who went missing
while we undergo autopsy identification
it might be related to the case
of the missing faimily
thank you for waiting
Nogami, good effort
the real work starts now
how many corpses are there?
five
that many? who are they?
we can't be certain
i am guessing 3 is from the Honda family
the other 2 might be the Mizuta couple
everyone related to the case
but there lies the problem
who was Honda Saki talking about
thats right
thats problematic
Marcus?
Marcus
Marcus
Mrs Takakura
Marcus is roaming the streets
i got a hold of him
arh okay, thank you for your help
mom will be worried
you can't go out just like that
he really wants freedom
is it like that?
are you happy roaming the streets?
Living in a house with
a yard for the first time?
let's go
thank you very much
madame
Can i call you Yasuko?
Thats alright
Yasuko can be more at ease
since you have already moved in
let me ask you
between your husband and me
who is more charming?
speak intuitively
only the truth
who is more charming?
i found the where mizuta work at previously
after enquiring by phone
i found some oddities
whats that?
3 years prior to the incident
he stop coming to work
from what i surmise
At that point in time the neighbour
of the Honda family...
I don't think is the Mitzuki family
That's right
who is it then?
no idea
what?
do you have anything you want to say to me?
not really
then say hello to your dad for me
Mr Takakura
that man is not my father
He is a total stranger
Hello
welcome home
you're early today
right
hello
Marcus ran out
it's lucky Mr Nishino got to him
I am good friends with Marcus
thats great
Mio, how are you?
Mio, i hope you don't go ranting
off without thinking
i did not
go do your homework
that hurts
i am going home
i must really thank you
that frightened me
what is it?
it's nothing
（The Other Man）
what are you doing here?
nothing, just making a phone call
to whom?
i said it's nothing worth mentioning
if it's nothing why are you not making
the call in the living room?
because you are working in the living room
it won't matter, is it
something that's not for my ears?
you are delusional
who is on the other end of the line?
must i tell you?
must i report every phone call i make?
when you're out
I might have made all kinds of calls
do i need to report all those?
Yasuko, what is up with you?
if you're unhappy with
the current situation
you can speak your mind
i am not unhappy
it's just i don't understand
what do you not get?
everything
I am sorry for losing my composure
i was making a call to a high school friend
okay
you don't have close friends
in the neighbourhood afterall
we finally moved into a new home
but i can't get accustom to it
it's really alright
it's just hard to make changes
you are right
the younger generation of
the police force need my expertise
we are investigating an old unsolved case
be at ease, i understand
i am not suitable to be a detective
Nogami, i am Takakura
check the details
of"Nishino Masayuki" for me
His address is Inagi
city,village 10, No 1254, Apt 6
Yes, he is my neighbour
it's not related to the Hino city case
but, don't laugh yet
i found many wierd similiarities
the position of Nishino and my apartment
is exactly the same with
the Honda and Mitzuki family
wierd isn't it?
excuse me, i am
Takakura from that apartment
can i enquire about something?
what were the Nishino family
like in the past?
what do you mean?
i am sorry for asking wierd questions
i am asking about Mr Nishino
we do not have contact with them at all
he is the same as before right?
oh okay
but did you notice?
basically Nishino is a freak
freak?
he is a freak
he seems normal on the outside
but he is cold blooded
he is simply inhuman
is this enough?
i don't have anymore to tell.
who is it?
hello, i am the police
i would like to enquire about something
are you Mr Nishino?
thats correct
can we talk inside?
plese come in
excuse me, are you Mr Nishino Masayuki?
yes
please wait a while
（Driver's License）
Mr Nishino?
I am entering
dear, what's happening?
i have no idea
call the fire brigade
I need to check on Mrs Tanaka
becareful
it will be fine
thats hot
Mrs Tanaka! Mrs Tanaka
sorry for the wait
sorry, can we talk in private?
why, is there anything that
is inconvenient for her to around?
dear, it's fine
i am Tanimoto from the Metropolitan Police
are you Mr Takakura from Togaku Uni?
you were in crime investigtion division 1
thats right
the explosion at the Tanaka's
next door is due to gas leakage
and so?
on the account you were in the
same line of work as i am
actually theres 3 burnt corpse
in the Tanaka house
why the special treatment?
2 of them are the
Tanaka mother and daugther
the last corpse....
we just confirmed the identity
who is it?
it's my subordinate Nogami
i don't understand why is
he at the Tanaka's
I heard he had private dealings with you
do you have any leads?
It's Nishino
what? Mr. Nishino next door?
there was a fire in
the neightbour's house last nite
and he was indifferent, watching TV at home
alright
whats your opinion Mr Tanimoto?
actually i made an enquiry from him
what did he say?
sorry but its confidential
what he say are lies
please calm down
Mr Nishino's initial reaction was
he wasn't the priority
he wants me to see what do
you think on this matter
he seems to trust you alot
this is ridiculous
i had made my point on the phone
i have nothing more to say
sorry, just one more thing
please look at this photo
my parents and brother died six years ago
isn't knowing this already enough?
no, the truth still eludes us
please stop torturing me
please wait
just 1 more question
this is the last time
this might well be the crucial evidence
have you seen this guy before?
is he your neighbour, Mr Mitzuki?
i don't know
please look carefully and try to recall
he is not Mr Mitzuki
really?
thats right
impossible
you said you don't remember Mr
Mitzuki's features
if you can't recall, he just might be it
please take 1 more look
please stop! don't cause
a ruckus at the door!
i am sorry, i will leave immediately
please wait in the room for a bit
Professor Takakura, what are you doing?
are you cold blooded?

let me see the computer files
in Nogami's computer
this is prohibited even if it's you
didn't you hear about Nishino Masayuki?
i am unsure
Nogami is investigating that man
he must have found something
please leave
Yasuko?
how are you.
i am Nishino Mio
Mio?
please open the door
please wait
why?
what happen?
do you know where have my wife gone?
do you know? does it haveanything
to do with your dad?

i finally understand
he is not your dad
i am Nishino, apologies
Mio must have given you some trouble
hey, Mio are you there?
daddy apologises to you
don't be angry, come home
Mio, call the police
Mr Takakura, isn't this kidnapping?
alright Nishino, give me a moment
why do you have my house keys?
what?
the police will be here shortly
you are an intruder who
break into properties
all your past deeds will be
under investigation
everything is at an end
that hurts
dear
Yasuko, why are you there?
Nishino did no wrong,he
is not a bad person
it's cause Mio is not behaving
did you give him the key?
Mr Nishino didn't do anything
the police is here
Yasuko, this man is not Mr Nishino
as for who he is, the
police will get it out of him
Uncle Takakura
yes? what is it?
i didn't call the police
let go of that person
let go of him
quickly let go of him
let go of him
stand up right now
are you mr Nshino, are you alright?
is everything alright?
Yasuko done go near him!
he is an imposter
don't believe him
Yasuko
don't be agitated,lets
go to the police station
Mr Tanimoto
sorry, but please leave us
but the statement is not done
i understand
please excuse me
thank you
i almost became a kidnapper
Mr Takakura
What exactly is happening?
what is the cause of death for Mr Nogami?
he seems to be in alot of debt
on the day of your meeting with him
he might have wanted to borrow some money
but you were not home
under desperation and stress
he broke into Tanaka's family home to
commit suicide using gas.
impossible, that is too ridiculous
thats right, but...
the station lost a hand gun
the word is that Nogami might
have taken it out
it might have gone to
the hands of the Yakuzas
Nishino is the culprit?
Mr Nishino next door?
wait a minute
lets put it this way for you
to better understand
it is a high chance Mr Nishino is
Honda's neighbour Mitzuki
what do you think?
alright
but one of the corpse found in the closet
of the Mitsuzi case was
proven to be Mr Mitzuki himself
thats right, and i deduce
Mr Mitzuki and Mr Nishino
was killed by that same man
including Nogami
actually i am investigating Nogami's
computer files
did you find anything?
nothing special, but...
there was a search for Nishino
Masayuki in the system
indeed there is
lets take a look
where are we going?
another room
Mr Nishino was just there
i am Mr Tanimoto of the Metropolitan Police
is Mr Nishino around?
he just left
why?
he say he is quite worried
for his family and his neighbours
and you just released him?
yes, he was the one reporting a crime
Mr Tanimoto, i need to get back
my wife is alone at home
alright, i will accompany you
your statement will
be casually completed later
i am going to the Nishino house
alright
Yasuko
Yasuko!
Mr Nishino
I am the police
I will be entering
Yasuko
You came in with me too?
lets go back
can't i stay a bit longer?
no you may not!
i had already sacrificed alot
i thought moving to a new envoirnment will
have a change of atmosphere
Yasuko
i am sorry
i completely disregarded your feelings
let us start over
our situation will definitely improve
lets go
please wait a bit
Mr Tanimoto, Mr Tanimoto
Yasuko?
wait a minute, i understand
what do you want?
nothing
i will not resist
please let Yasuko go
you are mistaken, Mr Takakura
She volunteered to stay
how about we put this to a test
there you see
i understand now
you always coerce others into
commiting a crime
i am not the perpertrator
it finally dawns on me
Yasuko, come over here
that man is useless
you can do this
come over to me quickly
i will protect you
miss Yasuko, are you certain?
don't be afraid, he is bluffing
yes
this is the way
thats it
you did great
Nishino
put the firearm on the ground
put it down!
you won't be able to do it anyway
Occasionally there are people like you
an antisocial psychopath
can be considered to be a mental
patient, really pathetic
what did you say
i am telling you, you are pathetic
how was a pathetic mental patient
able to confuse Yasuko?
making use of her good cutlinary skills?
or did you pretend to get close to Marcus?
i was almost fooled by you too
telling me about Mr takeuchi from
the administrative branch
like it really happened
there is really a colleague named Takeuchi
and so i believed you
but i will not be fooled anymore
the precarious state of your
life is going to end now
listen to me
place the firearm on the ground
intruding on families
coercing them to kill one another
and you watch on the sidelines
you are a coward who don't dare kill a bug
i am not wrong, arent i
you are...
really crazy
i am home
welcome home
we are moving
you dont have to go to school tomorrow
oh
and, we have 1 more family member
Mio, careful of your head
miss Yazuko,we are travelling on
highway 16 towards north right?
thats good
lets give it our best
i found a new home
Mio can be my daugther just like before
as for the Takakura couple, let me think
just act like my brother
and sister in law, that should be fine
Marcus
we are running out of gas, ill be someone
asking for the direction to a gas station
do your best to get to know them
they will be on guard from the start
we might have to sleep in
the car for 2 or 3 days
please bear with it
the four of us are a family afterall
isn't that right, Marcus
you are still quite a hindrance
sorry, Marcus
Mr Takakura
come here for a bit
here, you fire the shot
it shouldn't be hard for you
to pull the trigger right
shoot the neck region
if you aim and shoot the neck
1 bullet will be enough
the shot is very loud
what is it?
this trap has been dug for you
you deserve it!
idiot!
enough, he is dead
Marcus
Marcus follow me?
good, lets go
Marcus come
lets go
