Reminder. Audition 10:00 a.m. today.
Reminder. Audition...
They're gonna kick me out.
Taxi!
Come on.
Come on, taxi.
Oh!
Thank you!
This is my taxi!
This is a matter of life and death.
Midtown. Broadhurst Theatre.
Make it fast. I've got a major audition.
Oh!
Be fierce!
Next group.
Be fierce!
Work it!
Yes!
Yes! Push!
Push!
Well, we've got a few cuts
to make, ladies.
Sixteen.
And 22.
Yes.
Front row, thank you.
You're cut.
Collette?
One moment, ladies. I'll be right back.
Ruth Zimmer would like
to take a look at you.
She's coming in now.
Oh, I'm soaked to the bone!
What? That's horrid!
Oh, my God.
What kind of selfish girl
would do it to Ruth Zimmer?
She would.
So,
you're a really good dancer, are you?
I'll bet you're really good.
You look like you are.
Like you put every hour of every day
into sharpening every skill and every move
so you can be perfect.
But missy, your dreams
will never come true,
because as long as I live,
and I've got a lot of years left,
I will make sure
that you are never hired for any show,
on Broadway, Off-Broadway
or Off-Off-Broadway.
Your career is over, chorus girl.
- Miss Zimmer, please...
- Bring back your next choice, Collette.
I can explain.
- That won't be necessary.
- You're done.
- Miss Zimmer, please, could you just let...
- Let go.
Please.
- If you just... Please.
- Let go of me!
- Let me explain. You'll understand.
- Let go of me!
Ow!
Chorus girl.
Ooh! Somebody had a good morning.
What, Deco? I've had the worst day.
I know. I saw it.
- What?
- Baby girl, you are all over my feed.
All over it.
What are you talking about?
Oh!
- Is over, chorus girl.
- Oh, my gosh...
Let me explain.
- Let go of me!
- Please!
That wasn't my fault.
- She slipped and fell.
- Yes, and she broke her leg
and her wrist.
Oh, look. Another person
retweeted it to me.
How many people have watched this?
A couple hundred?
Oh, more like 30,000.
But who's counting?
This can't be happening.
She doesn't actually
have the power to end my career, right?
Just because she's one of the biggest
money people on Broadway?
Please.
I better call my agent.
Hi, this is April, for...
The April who pushed
Ruth Zimmer off the stage?
Yes. That April.
Hello?
Hello?
They hung up.
It was really nice knowing you.
I mean, have fun teaching Jazzercise.
No. There's gotta be someone
who isn't afraid of her.
- Someone who'll cast whoever they want.
- No, honey. Everybody's afraid of her.
Not him.
Not Welly Wong.
Okay.
And without an agent, how do you expect
to get in front of Welly Wong?
Nicole, you're saying, "Have auditions,"
I'm telling you I will.
We're looking everywhere.
We just haven't found our star yet.
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Nicole, I just need
to communicate...
I'm looking for a specific mix
of talent and loveliness.
You know what I mean? No!
Look harder.
I haven't found my lead dancer yet.
Oh, my gosh!
David, they're totally
on my case about this
so it looks like we have
to clear a day sometime next week,
to find our dancer.
We have to find a star,
- it's... it's imperative!
- Ow!
Hey, Dad.
There she is. What's new?
Not much, you know. Just...
Paying my dues.
It'll happen.
You've got the talent, sweetie.
Are you... out in the hallway?
Yeah, um...
I'm just waiting for my takeout.
Doing all right otherwise?
Do you need anything?
No. All good.
Oh, but my food's here,
so I should probably...
Yeah, okay.
Call me later, whenever you get a chance.
Yeah, I will.
Bye.
You heard from Mom lately?
Nope.
Oh, God.
I hope she hasn't seen that video of me.
Or people back here either, I would die.
Don't get too full of yourself.
People around here
have other things to worry about.
Yeah.
It's probably just me
with a Google alert on you.
I hate the Internet.
All right, boys, let's go,
come on. Pick up your feet.
- Go Churners.
- Great!
This rate, we'll be
the slowest football team.
- RJ, pick up the pace.
- I'm trying my best, coach.
You too, Goldilocks, come on.
- See the team still sucks.
- Get home next week.
- Buzz.
- Pick up your feet! Hey, Frank.
How you doing?
You call that a run? Let's go.
Has anyone moved into your old store?
No.
Stupid pharmacy chain,
putting us little guys out of business.
At least they gave you a job.
Yeah, part-time but...
I really blew it, Dad.
Such a failure.
Oh, honey.
You know what will make you feel better?
Cheese.
Thank you, Karen.
Say hi to your mom.
- Mmm...
- April! Oh!
- Miss Barb.
- Oh, my gosh!
Well, I was just getting snacks
for the pep rally. Go Churners!
- Go Churners!
- And I thought,
"Is that April?"
But then I go,
"Well, that can't be April
because April is in NYC." And yet,
here you are! Oh, my God!
Oh! I just saw Nick.
Well, how funny is that?
Nick's here?
Oh, my gosh.
It's just like old times.
I mean, you know,
minus you two being joined at the lips,
and before you broke up
in that text message.
I cannot believe you are standing
right in front of me.
Oh!
You remember my little one,
June?
Yeah, she was in Pampers
the last time that you saw her. Junie.
This is who I've been talking about.
Yeah, the high school's all-time
greatest cheerleader. Go Churners!
Go Churners!
And Mommy's biggest success story.
She is a Broadway star!
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh,
you have to come by the studio
and say hi to the girls!
I would love to.
Great!
But my dad's been sick.
- Who's sick?
- Oh, no. Frank, are you sick?
- Yeah...
- Oh, my God.
Well, I'll make you a casserole.
That's what I'm gonna do. Okay.
Well, it was just so,
so wonderful to... see you, and I just...
The girls will just... They'll be
so disappointed not to meet you, but...
I know, it's such a shame.
Let's not disappoint the girls.
She'll be happy to meet them.
Really? Oh, well that's fantastic!
Oh, my G... Okay, well,
you know where the studio is.
I'll see you at 5:30.
Take care of yourself, Frank.
Super.
Would it have killed you to play sick?
Whoopsie-daisy. Go Churners!
Go Churners!
Come on, ladies.
All right. Here we are.
Make sure you have everything.
Bye!
Have a good class.
Hey, Sarah. Don't forget
to help Michelle with her shoes, okay?
You don't have to tell me, Nick.
See you, guys.
Whoo! I bet you don't miss those stairs,
huh?
Oh! Look, we put your picture on the wall.
Honey, don't worry about that right now.
The little genius balances my books.
But I owe you this shift
for my classes this week.
The receipts can wait.
Come on,
help me get all the girls together.
We have a special guest tonight.
You know what?
Actually, will you please
get a chair for Miss April?
- Yes. On it.
- Mm-hmm.
I know I only taught you for eight years,
three months and 22 days
before you ended up
studying in Milwaukee for real.
But, you know,
I kind of like to think
I still had something to do with you
becoming a Broadway sensation.
Ooh! Speaking of which,
let me plant a seed.
While you're home visiting,
maybe you could teach a master class?
Or three?
Yeah, let me get back to you...
Because I was thinking,
for next year, maybe,
doing one of these.
- A dance competition.
- Yes!
- Wow!
- Yeah!
Oh, and you know, this one
has a special category
called the "Teacher Feature,"
where the teacher,
gets to perform with her students!
Isn't that adorable?
I mean, of course,
this year's first round is this weekend,
and even though we've been working
on a few routines,
we are nowhere near this level
or even remotely ready.
My dad is in the truck and...
Oh, my gosh, Frank!
I completely forgot.
- I gotta make him a casserole.
- Yeah.
- We've to get him to bed, don't we?
- We do.
Okay. So,
here we go. Well, just a little quick.
Michelle, sit still.
Sarah?
What are you doing here?
You look so much
older.
Oh, my goodness.
I want you to welcome
a very special guest,
straight from Broadway,
Miss April!
Right. You remember coach Buzz.
He leaves his son here
while he's at practice. Dicky!
Honey. Sh! Sh!
Just while his sister's in class.
All right. Questions, anyone?
Okay.
- Ruby.
- First off, I made this,
and I want you to have it.
Second off, I want you to wear it.
- Well, thank you, Ruby.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, my goodness,
that's just beautiful.
Uh, Zuzu.
How old were you when you started dancing?
- She's deaf?
- Mm-hmm.
How does she dance on the beat?
I feel the vibrations.
Um...
Kari.
How did you get to dance on Broadway?
Hard work. Next.
- Oona.
- When they pick people for parts in shows
does the most talented dancer
always get the part?
Nope. Next.
Lucia.
- What was I gonna say?
- Next.
- Michelle.
- How come you're not in any show now?
As a matter of fact, um...
I just got a part
in this huge Ruth Zimmer show.
Who's Ruth Zimmer?
- What do you play?
- What's the show about?
- Can we see a dance from it?
- I wanna be on Broadway.
I wanna be a Broadway star too!
- I can't wait till I'm on Broadway.
- Okay.
You guys wanna know
how to get on Broadway?
Simple.
Never make a mistake
in front of anyone important.
Ever.
But the thing is, you...
You don't really know
who the important people are.
So, really, you can't make a mistake
in front of anyone.
Ever!
And nothing can help you. Nothing.
Not even your little pig.
You manage to pull that off,
plus... talent,
I'd say you have a solid
point zero, zero, zero, zero
one percent chance of making it.
Any questions?
Nope?
Great.
Well, it's been thrilling, really.
Thank you for those inspiring
yet realistic words!
That was exciting, huh?
Hey, look who I ran into.
The rumors are true.
- You're back.
- Nick.
What are you doing here?
My sisters, you know, Sarah and Michelle.
Did they wipe your memory
while you were in New York?
No, I know.
But what are you doing back home?
Uh...
She's back 'cause I'm sick.
Oh, I didn't know.
Neither did I.
I'm gonna go.
- I'm gonna go rest in my truck.
- Yeah.
Thanks, Dad.
So...
So...
So...
So.
"So, how are you, Nick?"
I'm great.
"How you been?" Busy.
Yeah, you know,
my grandma has been
getting a little forgetful.
So, I've been taking over
more with my sisters,
on top of my job, and the classes,
you know, just doing the grown-up thing.
Oh, by the way, your dad
is still on me to, uh, fix the barn
from the time
we, uh, accidentally started that fire.
Since I'm back for a bit,
and clearly we're gonna
run into each other a lot,
I need to say that...
I know I broke your heart
when I ended things,
not in the most thoughtful way,
- and I...
- "Sorry to do this in a text,
but we have to break up. Ape."
See, it was very thoughtfully worded.
I just wanna make sure that if,
you know, there are any hard feelings
- that we can...
- Oh, April, April, April, April, April.
Did I say something funny?
No, no, no. It's just, uh...
Look, Ape, that was high school.
It's history.
Plus, it's not like
we were ever gonna last.
Well, anyway,
I should get back to the books.
See you, Frank.
That barn isn't gonna fix itself.
Well, I guess he's over you.
At least his skin's cleared up.
What's this?
I don't know.
Some dumb dance competition brochure.
She actually asked me to teach.
Can you believe that? To teach.
- Well, nice.
- No.
Not nice, Dad. I...
I'm not gonna teach
what I should be doing myself.
I might as well wear
a big fat "failure" sign.
Ow.
You know, this competition
doesn't look so dumb.
The finals are in Atlantic City
with a bunch of muckety-muck judges.
"Tony Award winner Marissa Jaret Winokur."
You're friends with her, right?
I mean, I danced
in a benefit she did once.
I doubt she has any idea who I am.
And that ballet dancer, Nadya Khrist...
Crazy long last name,
and big Broadway guy Willy Wang.
Welly Wong?
Yeah.
- Isn't that what I said?
- There's no way. Gimme that.
Son of a...
And punch.
And two, and three,
and over your head and five.
- I'll do it.
- And si...
On one condition.
We go all the way to Atlantic City.
And I'm gonna choreograph
a killer Teacher Feature.
Welcome to the first day
of the DanceDanceDanceDance.
Dance Competition Season.
We're very excited
to have you all here today.
I'm your host, Burt Davenport.
Let me remind you the national titles
are in three months in Atlantic City.
Judging the finals,
are theatrical phenomenon, Welly Wong,
Broadway star, Marissa Jaret Winokur,
and prima ballerina
Nadya Khristorozhdestvenskaya.
We have four studios
competing today in various categories,
and three will advance to the next round.
Best of luck to all our competitors.
Waupaca.
Way to express your tween angst.
I mean...
Next up, number 31.
Age eight and under.
Large group dance.
From Dewey, Wisconsin,
the Dewey Dance-'Em-All System.
Do their parents know
they dance like that?
Whoo! Get it, girl!
Make your mommy proud. Bounce. Ha!
Apparently so.
Number 14. Age ten to 13. Jazz.
Our reigning State Champs
for five straight years now.
Royalton Conservatory!
How do they do that?
They're so clean.
Oh, I love it... Sorry.
Royalton rules!
- Royalton!
- Yeah!
Oh, we're so dead.
- Royalton, way to dominate!
- Did you see how good that was?
Clear for talent.
- Ow!
- Next up, number 44.
Ten to 13, jazz.
Okay, hey? Come on, listen up.
Keep your eyes off the ground
and stay on the beat. Got it?
Nail-biter, smile for Pete's sake.
I don't wanna go out there.
I have an aversion to humiliation.
Yeah. Compared to them, we suck.
Look.
You're scared.
I mean, it's your first time onstage.
Plus, you've only had five days,
I get it, but, uh
we only have to come in third place
to make it to the next competition.
It can't be that difficult.
So suck it up and get out there.
That's your pep talk?
Grow a pair and do
what you and Miss Barb rehearsed.
Are you dancers or little girls?
We're little girls.
Let's give a hand
for our first-time entry, New Hope.
The New Hope Dance Studio.
Oh, gross.
Barb, leave it. It's fine.
I can't wait for you to see it.
They worked so hard.
Good luck, Lucia!
You got this, Oona!
Stay focused, sweetie.
What's happening?
I knew I should have put eyes on this.
Here we go.
- Kari! Come in.
- Coming.
Bigger.
Is this a joke?
Move.
- Is it over?
- That's it?
I guess that was the grand finale.
"New Hope", "No Hope."
Just wait till the Teacher Feature.
I'm okay, Mom!
Nailed it.
You're an incredible dancer,
Miss April. Flawless. You really are.
But you're missing the whole point.
It's to showcase the students
and what you've taught them.
It's not about you taking the spotlight.
- Attagirl.
- Hmm?
About time we had some good news
around here.
Good job, Miss April.
Way to go, Miss April.
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
- Okay.
- Did they call you?
Who?
The DanceDanceDanceDance
Dance Competition.
The Dewey Dance-'Em-All Studio
used a ten-year-old
in the eight-and-under category.
- And I should care because...
- You should care because
they are disqualified.
Which means we
came in third.
- We... We came in third.
- We came in third.
- Yeah. We came in third!
- We came in third!
We came in third!
Which means we're
gonna go on to the next round!
Oh! Okay.
Oh!
Attention, everybody.
This is not a drill.
The New Hope Dancers
are back in the competition!
Whoo!
Go Churners!
Go Churners!
Go Churners.
Gosh, I will just die
if we get all the way to Nationals
and I get to meet Marissa Jaret Winokur.
Oh, I saw her in Hairspray ten times.
Oh, that beautiful hair,
I just wanna nuzzle it and have her
sing me to sl... Hi!
Kari, do you have that permission
slip for the competition?
I can just swing by your mom's salon...
No. No. Don't do that. I have it.
Oh, great!
Hey, coach asked me to drop Dicky off.
So, here you go.
Okay.
Hello, Dicky.
- Hi.
- How was your day?
Good.
Yeah?
Did you have fun?
Did you have recess?
Yeah.
Oh, thanks.
Okay, ladies. Listen up!
Somehow, we're still in this thing.
But please, let's not fool ourselves.
We still have a lot of work to do.
We only need to keep
coming third to be in it.
How are we gonna do that?
Can you explain
how we actually advance rounds?
AKA, how do we accumulate points?
Ruby, honey, it's a weighted
average per number.
So you've got group numbers, solos...
Just do exactly what I say
and we'll advance.
Got it?
Now, before we begin,
there are three basic ground rules.
Rule number one: Focus!
Clearly no one's ever taught you how.
No offense, Miss Barb.
None taken.
So, from now on,
anyone who speaks without permission,
- drops and gives me 20 push-ups.
- Yeah, okay.
I'm not kidding.
Number two:
Commitment.
A dancer without technique is nothing.
So, right now,
you are nothing.
Number three:
Do.
Exactly
what...
I...
say.
Got it?
- Got it?
- Yes.
- Yes, Miss April.
- Yes, Miss April.
Everyone, take a spot at the barre.
Yes, Miss April.
Mommy. I already forgot what rule one is.
No talking!
- Oh, yeah.
- Drop and give me 20 push-ups. Now.
Yes, Miss April.
One.
- Two. Three.
- We have two weeks till Counties.
- Four.
- Two weeks. Two.
Not a lot of time
to whip you guys into shape.
So,
from now on
unless you're asleep, or at school
you will be here.
Practicing,
day in and day out.
Seventeen.
Left hand on the barre.
- Twenty.
- Miss Barb, count 'em in.
And side, again the front.
And side and back, the side to the front.
- Keep going. Side.
- Timing.
Do it again.
Maybe we should take a little break.
- They get five minutes at 9:00 p.m.
- Okay.
Feel the beat.
There's no syncopation here.
Then where can the sink go on vacation?
You. Push-ups.
Now.
Yes, Miss April.
Let's take it from the glissade piqué.
From the top.
Today.
Okay, hustle. Everybody ready?
One, two, three, four,
five, six, over!
- And...
- My glasses!
Stop!
Sorry, Ruby!
Eyeballs. Do I have
to duct tape those to your face?
Fingers.
I thought you could feel the beat.
So why are you always behind?
And...
- Pigtails.
- Okay.
You literally have no idea
what you're doing.
Don't waste my time
and go learn the steps.
Go!
The rest of you, up on your highest
demi-pointe. Close your ribs. Again.
Again?
Today.
Okay. Everybody ready?
Ready?
One, two, three, four, five, six, over!
- And up!
- Stop!
Oh, okay. Stop.
Is everyone ready?
We're ready.
In positions.
That's two straight lines.
Okay. Everybody hustle. Ready?
One, two, three, four, five, six, over!
And up!
- On your leg.
- Over. And up!
- On your leg. Get on your leg!
- Over. And...
Do you hear me yelling at you?
Then do it!
What is the problem?
Maybe it's that we have
no idea what you're yelling.
If we weren't on our legs,
we'd be on our butts!
Okay. Okay.
All right. Why don't you just
- take a moment to explain...
- Yeah.
How about you try teaching?
Instead of leaving us clueless,
standing here with our wieners
swinging in the breeze.
You think you can do better?
Well, you're such a crappy teacher,
I certainly can't do worse.
Get out of my class.
Make me.
Get out
of my
class.
You get out of my face!
I'm done.
Good luck, Miss Barb.
- They're hopeless.
- I knew you wouldn't stick around.
You got something else to say?
Don't be shy, Nail-biter.
Kari...
Where's my crayon?
Woman, you better be calling to apologize.
For what?
Oh, it's you. I'm sorry.
I thought you were Mar Jar.
- Who?
- Marissa Jaret Winokur.
Oh, I danced in a benefit
she did for Broadway Cares.
Well, I loaned that thief
these vintage Louboutins
for this Tony Award
Winners Luncheon, and now she
claims she gave 'em back.
But why are you calling me?
I thought you got banished
to, uh... Idaho?
Wisconsin.
- Oh!
- Long story short,
this amazing opportunity presented itself
to dance in front of Welly Wong. And...
- That's it. I quit.
- Hold on.
I'm quitting.
Am I really that bad?
Uh...
Yeah.
Oh.
I just wanna be good at something.
- I'll find something else to do.
- I'm just gonna
- close this anyway.
- Thank you, Miss April.
You still there?
Your maternal instincts
are beyond aspirational.
Okay.
Being "on your leg" is kind of like
the difference between
a banana and a carrot.
See? Crooked things
can't balance. Aw.
But
straight things...
- Aw!
- Aw!
Wait. Why didn't she just say that?
Oh, you know.
Miss April's kinda funny.
You know, she always wants to be perfect,
and, you know, she was about your age
when she decided that she needed
to become an amazing dancer.
So, she started pushing herself
harder, harder, and
she forgets that other people
aren't as perfect as she is.
So, we
gotta be real patient with her.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Can I tell you a secret?
Sometimes I feel like a banana.
Mm-hmm.
What about you?
Are you a banana or a carrot?
A carrot.
I'm so proud of you. Good job.
- You don't have to stop.
- I have to get home anyway.
If you connect to your center and
you really hold your core,
you'll have more control over your body.
Super, thanks.
And if there's ever anything
that you wanna talk about that you
maybe can't talk to Nick
or your grandma about it.
- I've been there, done that, so...
- All set. Can I go now?
Look, Sarah,
I'm just trying to meet you halfway.
We're not in class, so I don't
have to listen to anything you say.
What is your problem?
What happened to you?
You weren't like this before.
Before what?
Before you left or before my mom died?
No, don't use that as a crutch.
- I had to grow up without a mom too.
- Did she die?
No.
No. My mom left me by choice.
You wanna unpack that one?
Well, like mother, like daughter, I guess.
Excuse me?
You left without even saying goodbye.
Sarah, people live their own lives.
Get used to it.
Besides, it's not like I was dating you.
Right. Then I'd at least have gotten
a text message.
But who cares
about the dumb little sister anyway?
There's got to have been a thousand people
that auditioned before me.
I've been waiting to audition
for the new Welly Wong show "Whirly Girl,"
and I'm almost at the front.
I hope I get a callback.
Hey!
- What are you doing down there?
- Looking for my phone.
It's in your hand.
Yes, that's 'cause I already found it.
Obviously.
Um, so what are you doing here?
Oh, you know, not much.
I was just working down the street
when I saw Grandma drive by in my truck.
Hey, Grams!
Oh, Nicky!
Technically, she's not allowed
to drive anymore
but she loves this merry-go-round.
So...
Sarah told me you guys
had a fun class last night.
Oh, yeah. It was a barrel of laughs.
I mean, I'm trying to help her,
but it's like a brick wall.
That doesn't sound right.
- Really?
- Yeah, you trying to help someone?
Ha ha. Very funny.
Hey, look, she's not gonna put out
the welcome mat just 'cause you're back.
You know, you're the reason
she started dancing.
You were her lifeline and then
poof.
You know, if you really wanna help her,
try remembering what it was like
when you were in her shoes.
You know,
when you were all moody
and wearing flannel.
- That never happened.
- Pictures don't lie.
No, I have no recollection.
- Oh, okay.
- Mm-hmm.
Rehearsals can get intense.
It's part of the job.
Duh, that's why Ruby quit.
Moving on.
Dude, you walked out after one class.
We're just kids.
We don't learn
as fast as you professionals.
And what about rule number two?
Commitment?
Point taken.
If you promise to do what I tell you.
And curtail the attitude,
I promise to honor my commitment,
and see it through to the end.
Deal?
Well, what do you guys want to do?
I mean...
I want to keep competing.
- Me too.
- Me too.
But I don't want to do it
with her.
- Me too.
- Me too.
Well, yeah,
but she's the only one good enough
to get us there.
So, do we have a deal?
Deal.
Okay.
Let's start with the barre,
because we've got a lot to do
in two weeks.
First position.
Fifth position.
There it is.
That's a nice port de bras. See that?
I can't see anything.
Twenty.
Fourth position.
Again.
Step battement. Battement.
Side. Back. Step battement. Front.
All right, listen.
I'll see you tonight, okay? Be good.
- Side.
- Bye, Dad.
- Zuzu, I love you.
- Coach!
- This is not free daycare.
- All right.
First position.
Fifth position.
Fifth position.
- Fourth position.
- Fourth position.
Again.
What is this?
What is this?
Noodle arms. You might as well just
wave goodbye to Nationals.
Wave goodbye. Bye.
Turn, turn, turn.
My glasses!
You have to spot. That's why you're dizzy.
Again.
Prepare.
Pirouette.
And turn.
Turn, turn, turn, turn.
Fingers. Sarah.
That's exactly why you're in the back.
How many times do I have to say this?
You have to practice at home.
Again. Prepare.
No, sweetheart. Okay, it's close.
It's three, four, head roll,
contract, pas de bourrée.
Five, six, ready to turn, one!
Step two, and two.
And three. Hip!
Contract, pas de bourrée.
You good? Beautiful.
Hi, honey.
What are you doing in the dark?
Nothing. Just homework.
Put on a light.
And get to bed soon.
Spotting will keep you from getting dizzy.
Spot the faces.
Ready, girls?
Take it away.
Red face.
Red face.
Red face.
Red face.
Again.
Green face.
Green face.
Green face.
Blue face!
Blue face.
Purple face!
Green!
Blue!
Red!
Two, three, four, and five.
- Six, seven, eight and one.
- Are we bananas, or are we carrots?
Three, four, five and six,
- seven, eight.
- Shoulders,
it's not just about doing the moves.
You have to sell it.
- Seven, eight.
- Stop!
Shoulders, get to the back.
You heard me.
Fingers.
Go to the front.
Yes!
That's what I'm talking about.
That's my girl.
That's 20, Coach.
- Sorry, Miss April, I'll do right here.
- Make it 40.
Yeah. Sorry, okay.
Two.
Again!
And there's five, six, seven, eight.
Hands on hips, here we go.
And one, two, three,
four, five and six, seven, eight. One,
two, three, four, five, six, seven,
up, down!
That...
Didn't suck.
We don't suck!
Whoo!
Yeah!
We don't suck.
- They don't suck.
- All right, back to one!
We don't suck!
You still suck a little.
It's okay.
Okay, so, uh...
I mean, we can't dance in this...
Now, what do we do?
Class is over.
Obviously.
- Let's go.
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Wait, where are you going?
- Where's everybody...
To the park!
What's going on? Hey!
We don't suck!
Hi, uh...
No, no, I didn't mean to...
It's okay.
I just need to see what I have to pick up
at the hardware store.
I just had some time,
thought I'd fix up the barn.
Get your dad off my back.
Who'd have thought back in high school,
you'd end up being so
handy.
Yeah, I know, right?
You know, not that any of this
is how I pictured my life would be.
Yeah.
Welcome to the club.
Oh, please. You were dancing on Broadway.
I'd say your life turned out
exactly how you thought it would.
You know, Nick... um...
Even if your life
isn't entirely what you pictured,
I do really admire what you did.
Dropping your life
- to take care of your sister...
- I didn't, you know, "drop" my life.
You know, you do what you have to.
What you think is right.
No, I know.
That's just what you do.
- I just mean that I...
- No, I know. It's not...
It's not exactly the
big plan we came up with.
Running away to New York together.
No.
It's not.
You now, Ape, uh
after,
"The Text..."
I went to New York,
and then I saw you.
What?
You were coming out
of your rehearsal on 46th Street.
And you had never looked happier.
And then I knew.
I had to let you go.
You know, we... We wouldn't have worked out
for a million reasons.
Yeah. No.
But...
I bet it would have been fun to try.
Well, I should probably get to it.
Yeah. No, me too.
Nine, eight, seven! Set!
Okay gentlemen,
really drive those legs, okay?
- Push this thing.
- Listen up, ladies.
Coach Buzz has agreed to share his field
'cause we can't afford to fix the studio.
But that doesn't change the fact
that Counties are this weekend.
So...
- You're totally staring at RJ!
- No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
Lucia, Sarah, Oona?
Push-ups, now.
Yes, Miss April.
Shut up.
You actually called them by their names.
And it was right.
So, I learned a name or two.
Zuzu, drop.
Twenty.
You too, Kari.
But she made me interpret.
Oh, that's 40.
Let's get 'em onto the tires. Let's go!
Come on. Helmets off.
Let's go, dipsticks!
Come on, I don't have all day.
RJ has two left feet!
What? You think you can do better?
They're just dancers.
Okay, let's see you boys try this.
Well, they don't have pads on, so...
Okay.
Temps levé!
Show 'em, ladies.
You gentlemen see
what's happening?
- Do you guys need into ballet?
- No way.
You were saying?
Bye, Mom.
Wait, where are you off to so early?
I told you.
Oona and I are studying
for our big geometry test all day.
Right. I forgot.
Well, I've got my shift tonight
- at Royalton Steakhouse...
- I know. I got my key.
- Bye, Mom.
- Love you!
Love you too!
Hey, Ruby is back.
- It's Ruby!
- Honey, what are you doing here?
Can I come along?
Not to dance, just to watch.
My mom said it was okay.
Oh, Lord, we would love to have you back.
You ready? I need so much help.
You gonna help me?
- Okay. Have a seat.
- Ruby, back here, Ruby!
- Hi, Ruby.
- Hi, Sarah.
It's a full house. Let's go.
- All right. Let's rock and roll.
- Everybody sit, please. Thank you.
Hi, Patty.
You forgot something.
"Studying all day with Oona," huh?
- Mom, I...
- Off the bus. Right now, young lady.
Oh, I'm sorry, that's just not possible.
Look. I don't want any trouble.
I'm just getting my daughter.
Kari, get your things.
- Patty, please.
- No, Barb.
I don't appreciate
you going behind my back.
I'm sorry, but I... I thought you knew.
I didn't.
Come on, Kari.
Kari, honey.
You gotta go with your mom.
Let's go! Now!
No, Mom.
I'm not going.
We discussed this.
I'm doing the best I can
while Daddy's deployed,
but we can't afford dance right now.
And we don't take charity.
Now come on.
I'm gonna be late for work.
It's not charity.
I figured it out.
I made the deal with Miss Barb
to work at the studio.
I earned the classes.
And I earned a spot in this competition.
So, I'm staying.
Fine.
But we are going
to talk about this at home.
Hey.
That took guts.
Now, uh...
Just don't puke them up on me.
You guys ready?
- Yes!
- Yes, Miss April!
Take it away, Gordy.
Look at you. Fixing barns, fixing hair...
- Nick! Ah, smoke. Fire.
- Ah!
Shush.
- What smells funny?
- Nothing. Go back to sleep, Michelle.
Okay.
Our category is on deck.
Time to wake up, sleepyheads.
Here we go. Yummy, yummy time.
- Drink for mommy.
- Barb, what's that?
Iced mocha with an extra shot of espresso.
An extra shot of espresso.
Yeah.
Don't worry,
I have allergy pills for the ride home.
It'll bring 'em right down.
They're for adults,
but I just break 'em in half.
Please, put your hands together
for the minis-under-six category.
New Hope Dance Studio, Group Jazz.
Dance. Dance!
Jump.
I can't watch this.
Dicky! That's my boy!
Dicky!
Oh, my gosh!
Five, six, seven, eight.
And... how's this?
- Acceptable.
- Hey.
I heard you guys need some
professional help.
Us working girls gotta stick together.
Hey, Teacher Feature is on deck.
- Oh, perfect.
- Let's go.
- Losers!
- Look at these guys.
Hey! Don't forget we trounced you guys
at State like seven years straight.
Stop living in the past.
Our boys have been kicking your butts
on the field for the last decade.
Now our girls are kicking it on stage.
Your girls wouldn't know a triple
time step if our girls were dancing it
- on their sad little faces.
- What did you say?
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Well, your daughter's grand battements
don't even reach 90 degrees.
- Your daughter has no turn out.
- Your daughter has got no stage presence.
You take that back!
Make me.
Coming up next
is the New Hope Dance Studio,
competing in
the Teacher Feature category,
led by Broadway sensation, April Dibrina.
They've rapidly risen through the ranks
to be a contender today.
What a loser. So embarrassing.
Ah, here they are.
I will make sure
you are never hired by any show,
- on Broadway, Off-Broadway...
- Miss April? What's going on?
Your career is over.
Chorus Girls!
Miss Zimmer, if you just let me expl...
Let's go.
- Please!
- Let go of me! Let go!
- Please!
- Let go!
I don't understand.
Guess your big-time Broadway teacher
isn't so big-time.
Just keep moving, guys. Come on.
Break a leg, chorus girl.
And a wrist. And fall over.
Oh, the '70s called.
They want their dance skirts back.
Let go!
- Please!
- Let go!
Chorus girl!
No, no. Don't.
Come on.
Churners!
Go Churners!
And now,
what you've all been waiting for:
The top awards in the DanceDanceDanceDance
Wisconsin All-State Competition.
Now, these three studios
did every move perfectly.
They danced their hearts out,
and left it all on the stage.
Their rankings are unanimous
with our judges.
They take into account both...
There's no way
we're gonna make the cut.
We just need to come in third.
We can totally do that.
Yeah. Oona made the fall
look like it was part of the dance.
Hey.
Who cares about that stupid video anyways?
The three studios who will advance
to Nationals in Atlantic City,
to dance in front of the one-and-only
Welly Wong are:
Please just let us come in third.
Please, please, please.
Winning the third place Gold Trophy...
Milwaukee's Bottle Cap Dance Studio!
Let's give 'em a big
DanceDanceDanceDance round of applause.
And now, the second place High Gold Trophy
goes to...
The New Hope Dance Studio!
Uh, perhaps you didn't hear me.
The New Hope Dance Studio!
We came in second!
We're going to Nationals!
What a crowd!
We're going to Nationals!
Oh, my God!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
We're going to Nationals!
We're going to Nationals!
We're going to Nationals!
We're going to Nationals.
I don't know, Ape.
This Star Lift is hard.
You sure Dicky can do it?
He has to.
We gotta step it up for Nationals.
Okay, - Okay, Nick,
lock out your elbows,
and make sure you don't...
His little ribs are gonna get crushed.
Nah, kids' bones are like rubber.
They'll only bend a little.
You have a
cobweb in your hair.
Was this all part of your plan?
Getting me to fall for you.
Uh, Ape, come on, it was a stupid joke.
You know, 'cause we "fell."
Yeah. I know. I get it.
April? April... Oh!
- We were just working on a...
- We're just...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- The Star Lift, yeah.
- For the comp...
- The kids.
- Yeah? Okay.
- Right.
Uh, it occurred to me at exactly 2:47 a.m.
that we have a big problem.
We have to fly
30 people to Atlantic City.
Plus food and hotel. That's a fortune!
How are we gonna
fundraise all that money?
That's a lot of raffles,
bake sales and car washes!
What about costumes?
Do you have any idea
- how high the bar is at Nationals?
- So high.
They expect flash.
They expect over-the-top works of art!
I think I can help with that.
Thank you, Frank.
Cheese and crackers.
- Who's he?
- I love his skirt.
Did somebody call
for an over-the-top work of art?
I'm here.
Howdy, fellas.
Okay.
So, we need more some bling.
Does anybody own a BeDazzler?
Me!
Ooh, I'll take all of them.
Because these old prom dresses
need a lot of bedazzling.
- Uh, where do you guys want these?
- Hi!
Oh, you know what?
Put that in that pile over there.
- Thanks, RJ.
- Thanks, guys.
- Thanks, Christopher.
- Here you go.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Do you need any help?
- Yeah, sure.
Cool.
- I'm RJ by the way.
- I'm Rachel.
You're not from around here.
These are the last of our boxes
for our move to the barn.
This was the first recital
after my mom left.
Oh, my gosh, honey. Yeah.
I remember that now.
- Hey, Miss Barb, can I ask you a question?
- Of course.
Are you happy?
I love my life.
I chose this life.
I love teaching,
and I love owning my own business,
and...
I love
living in a town where,
if I'm feeling a little under the weather,
the next thing I know,
there's a casserole on my porch.
Well, you did way more than just
make a few casseroles for us
after my mom left.
Oh, well, it...
I just don't think I ever told you
what a difference that all made.
Well, you
are making a difference for these kids.
Whether you know it or not.
Hey, Miss Barb.
Can I ask you one more question?
Mm-hmm.
What is going on with this perm?
Oh, that is a lot of damage
to the ozone right there.
Oh...
- Thanks.
- Get well, Frank.
44, 45...
46, 47, 48, 49, 50,
51, 52, 53,
54, 55, 56.
- You win.
- Fifty-seven!
- Go June!
- Good job!
Okay, everybody.
First off, welcome to our new home.
Second... we did it.
We're gonna be eating
PB&amp;J for a really long time,
but we raised the money!
Atlantic City, here we come!
Go Churners!
Churners!
Churners! Churners! Churners!
Churners! Churners!
Okay, okay, okay.
We're not there yet,
and we still have a lot of work to do.
So tonight, after Open Technique class,
we'll be running all of the dances,
top-to-bottom.
Got it? Cool.
But before we do that,
we need to make sure
that we nail the Star Lift. So,
little dancers, front and center.
Ready? And lift.
Hold. There it is. Use those muscles.
Let's try that again. Count of three.
One, two, three!
And Star Lift!
There it is. Perfect. Oh!
Shake it off. And...
There... Oh, no. Okay, lift.
Now, get under...
Ow!
You all right, buddy?
Yeah.
Let's
try it with one of the bigger kids,
so you guys can see how it's done.
We have football players here, so...
I need Sarah
and... RJ.
- Me?
- Let's go.
Yeah. Come on. Put those muscles to work.
Come on, Sarah. Go.
- Let's go.
- It's your shot.
- Go, Sarah, go.
- This is your chance.
Easy-peasy. Okay. So...
Okay, you know what to do?
When you're ready.
Sarah, hold your center, point your toes.
RJ lock out your elbows.
There it is. Don't lose it. Ooh!
There it is. Perfect.
Okay. Sarah, hold your core.
Don't lose it.
Gently dip her down into a fish.
Gently. Squeeze your core, squeeze your...
Don't lose it. Don't lose it.
Don't lose it. Don't...
- That fall out of your sandwich?
- Hey!
Stop it!
Could you stop?
Sarah! Sarah!
Sarah, wait up!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Come here.
Go to the ballroom,
check the floor, make sure...
Don't forget we have
to check out the Royalton...
- Hey.
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry...
No. "Hey," as in, I know you, right?
You're MJW. It's really you.
You're so beautiful.
I know how I know you.
April, right?
You danced in one of my
Broadway Cares benefits.
You're an amazing dancer.
You've got great technique.
Marissa...
You!
Well, if it isn't the shrill,
little shoe thief.
Oscar de "Low-Rent" -tah.
Where are my heels?
Oh, I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.
Aw...
Big Brother,
you're not that good an actress.
I'll have you know,
I won a Tony Award for Best Actress
- in a musical.
- Oh, my God.
My God. I'm sorry, what?
Give it a rest, honey.
Ugh, "You Can't Stop The Beat" -ing
us all over the head
with that dusty newsflash.
How's that for beating you over the head?
Ooh! I'm gonna keep this as collateral.
- Okay. I think we gotta go.
- Oh, do we?
- Yeah.
- I was just getting warmed up.
That's fine.
That shoe belongs to RuPaul anyway!
Oh! You stole from RuPaul too?
Next up, Wisconsin state champions,
Royalton Dance Conservatory.
Go Royalton!
This morning's competition
has been fierce...
- So, jackets off, please.
- Buddy. Let me help you out.
Showing us what they've got.
Ow!
What happened?
Oh, my goodness. Honey...
Miss April told you two
not to practice the Star Lift too much.
Dicky, bud.
Why didn't you tell me?
He was hiding it.
I was afraid you wouldn't let me dance.
So, what do we do?
- Do we tell them we can't go on or...
- No.
I can do it.
I just have to think of something else
they can do instead of the Star Lift.
Next up, New Hope Dance Studio.
All right. Well, everybody
take your places. Let's go.
Wait! No, strike a pose
instead of the lift, okay?
Strike a pose instead of the lift!
They're gonna be great.
It's going well. It's going well.
Yes!
Dicky, no!
No.
Don't do the Star Lift, Dicky.
Don't do it.
- Do not...
- Don't...
- What are they doing?
- Don't know.
Don't!
- New Hope rules!
- New Hope!
Oh, my God!
My daughter is a beast!
Coming up is New Hope
with their contemporary routine,
led by their teacher, April Dibrina.
Let's see if they can impress
Broadway's Welly Wong.
Ape? You in there?
Hey.
We are almost up. The girls are waiting,
and Miss Barb looks like
she's about to pass a kidney stone.
Hey. You okay?
What if I blow it?
You're serious?
Wait. All those times in front
of paying audiences,
and you're nervous about this?
Nick, I was just in the chorus.
No one was ever looking at me.
And now, everyone is counting on me.
The girls, my dad, the town,
and I can't let everyone down.
Hey, how could you possibly
let anyone down?
April.
What you've done for everyone?
It's amazing.
You know when you told me that you came
to New York after I sent you "The Text"?
Yeah.
I really wish I'd seen you that day.
Next up, New Hope Teacher Feature.
We are family.
We are family.
Always.
We are family.
Always.
- Whoo! We made it!
- We're in the final round!
We did it! We crushed it!
They loved the Teacher Feature.
We made it!
- Just like I taught you.
- Just like you taught me.
You two slayed it!
- Yeah!
- Yeah, you did!
Oh, yeah, you did!
April! I have to run back to take care
of an emergency but
can I steal you away for a moment?
I have a proposition for you.
Yes, of course. Um...
I will catch up with you guys.
Okay, all right, well,
notes in the dressing room,
everybody. Come on.
This couldn't have worked out
more perfectly, right?
April? Hey.
I was just coming to find you, um...
Where are you going?
I'm, uh...
I'm headed back to New York.
What?
Welly Wong offered me
a part in his new show.
The lead.
And I have to be at rehearsals now.
Welly's been called back.
Oh, what about finals?
They're tomorrow.
I'll tell him you'll be right out.
Yeah. Thanks.
So, you're just ditching us?
But this whole thing was your idea.
You made a commitment.
I know. But what am I supposed to do?
Sarah, I've dreamt of this my whole life.
So, I'm going.
That was the plan the whole time,
wasn't it?
You just wanted to use
the stupid little girls
so you could claw your way back
to Broadway.
I knew it. I knew it the whole time.
You're just a selfish jerk!
Okay, you don't care
about anyone but yourself!
You're just leaving me again!
Good luck tomorrow.
April...
April, wait! April!
Wait! Wait!
Please.
Please don't go.
- Please.
- You don't need me.
You're gonna be great.
- I promise.
- Please.
- I'm sorry.
- No, please, don't...
Hey! April!
April!
Yes! Do you want me to... Oh, this?
Okay. Ready? One, two, three!
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Yay, Piggy!
- Hey!
Sarah?
Everybody. Everybody, attention, please.
Andrew, Michael, ladies.
Guess who this is?
This is our Whirly Girl, April.
Let's all give her a warm welcome.
Thanks.
You're welcome, baby girl.
Good night.
Good night.
8.
Hello?
I'm doing the right thing, right?
Well, sweetheart, you've been busting
your ass at this for quite a long time.
I mean, I finally got my dream.
It's the perfect show.
The perfect role.
I don't know, I just...
I thought I'd be happier.
Yeah.
That's the problem
with being a perfectionist.
Nothing's ever good enough.
You know, I keep telling myself.
I'm a dancer.
This is what I'm supposed to do.
Says who?
You do what your gut tells you to do.
And if there's any part of you that thinks
that making a big splash on Broadway
is suddenly gonna bring your mom back,
you can forget about that.
There's nothing you can do
to bring her back.
Because it wasn't your fault
that she left in the first place.
She just left.
So, whatever you decide,
just make sure that it makes
you feel good about who you are.
I mean
it's what I've always wanted to be.
I'd be stupid not to.
I didn't say "what you are," I said "who."
And I can think of nine little reasons
why it wouldn't be so stupid.
Hey, everybody.
We'll start scene work in five minutes.
Top of the second act.
Mr. Wong.
Mr. Wong. I'm sorry, Mr. Wong,
but I have to go back to the competition.
If that means that you have
to give my part to someone else,
I understand. I mean, I don't want you to,
because I think you need someone
who honors their commitments.
And you see, that's exactly
why I have to go, because...
I have nine little kids
that I committed to.
You know, I have a whole town
that's counting on me.
So, I have to go.
What the...
When do they go on?
They're in the first group after lunch,
- but I can't find them.
- Okay, I'm on my way back.
- You'll never make it in time!
- Get them ready. I'll be there. Promise!
Ruby,
- find them.
- On it.
You couldn't have asked
to borrow his limo?
Just admit it. You love me.
- You owe me gas money.
- To Atlantic City!
Hi, I'm Burt Davenport,
and we continue on
with day two of our competition!
- Next up, number 44.
- Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
- Large group production number.
- Gosh.
The New Hope Dance Studio.
- Okay?
- Okay?
- Goodbye, yep!
- Go! Run! You can make it! Go!
- This is the final countdown...
- Excuse me, coming through.
For the New Hope Dance Studio.
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my God!
- We're at our countdown.
- Okay.
Okay.
They should be... Oh, no.
- Where are they?
- I don't know.
I don't know. I was panicking.
I said to Ruby, I was like, "Find them,"
but I wasn't...
I didn't specifically say like,
"Bring them stage left." I...
Everybody, get ready.
Hurry, we are in our final countdown.
What's she doing here?
Yeah, I wonder
who's in the audience this time?
What happened to your amazing job?
Well, they probably fired her.
Again.
Look, you have every right to hate me,
but you earned this.
You deserve to be here.
So, please don't sit out on this
just because you wanna get back at me.
When I first met you,
all I saw were flaws.
And then I realized, that's exactly
what makes you spectacular.
All those beautiful quirks
and imperfections.
And I'm so sorry that I left.
It just... It took me a second
to realize that
we've become family.
What's wrong with you?
How come you're not yelling at us?
I want you to know
how proud I am of all of you.
You've all become
the most beautiful dancers.
You're scaring me.
- Michelle...
- New Hope.
Dance Studio, last call.
You have one minute to be on stage
or you will be disqualified.
Disgusted. I'm disgusted
by all this whimpering self-pity.
Now, this is not how I trained you.
So, put on your big-girl pants.
You too, Dicky. You get on that stage,
or else.
You have till the count of five. One.
Oh, you thought
I was being tough on you before.
Oh, no, I was just getting started.
- Two!
- Jackets. Okay.
Give me your jackets. Jackets!
Yeah, that's what I thought. Three!
Come on, let's do it.
Clear for talent.
Step aside. Fierceness is coming through.
You better kick butt, or I'll kick yours!
Hi!
You made it.
Whoo!
Work it, girl! Yeah!
Wow! What a killer routine!
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
I don't think he's out there, honey.
{\an8}Gordy told me he took off
when he heard you were back.
{\an8}"Sorry to do this in a text."
Oh...
- Hi, honey.
- Barb.
You're so... What did I tell you?
- You have to hold it away from your face.
- Sorry.
- I'm just gonna see every pore.
- Okay, well...
Listen, I got some bad news.
That barn's roof is leaking.
I mean, so much worse than my studio.
- Well, I asked Nick to repair it and...
- Whoa, hold on.
Okay, in my defense,
I said we should replace, not repair.
Well, anyway, we canceled class.
Okay, bye.
Hang on. Hang on.
That's not the agreement.
I teach class over FaceTime.
They do what I say.
I fly back every Sunday.
They do what I say.
- Okay. But...
- And what I say is,
I don't really care if there's
three feet of water and they have to swim.
Mm-hmm.
They show up to class.
I know. We gotta
beat the Royaltons next year.
Well, I'll get them all together
and call you when I have them.
Okay.
Bye.
Come in. Oh, Mr. Wong. Hi.
I have some notes. A couple tweaks.
But
it didn't suck.
Thank you.
Oh, before I forget,
they said somebody's
waiting for you in the theater.
What are you guys doing here?
Well, you asked me
to get everyone together.
How did you guys afford this?
Discussion for later.
I will call you next week.
Improve your listening skills.
I said I'd call you next week.
So, what are we gonna do now?
We're having
an opening night dance party.
You guys ready?
Dicky!
Awesome.
{\an8}Come on, MJW.
{\an8}Goodnight, New York!
