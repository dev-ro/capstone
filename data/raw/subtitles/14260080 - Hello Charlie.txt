Jai Shri Krishna, how do you do?
This is Mumbai, the city of the rich.
Bilions are made in business here everyday.
And in business, there are two kinds of people.
On one hand, colourful playboy
business tycoon MD Makwana.
After defaulting on loans worth billions,
he is running away from Mumbai.
And then there is this fellow,
with the red bag.
He has come to Mumbai to pay off his loan.
Straight from Indore, Chirag Rastogi.
In short, Charlie.
Charlie is no less colourful, but he has a problem.
Wherever he goes, big problems follow.
And that's me, Karsan Patel.
Charlie's uncle.
I had a lovely life, until now.
Hey... Charlie... what a surprise.
So how many days are you staying?
Days? It might take months,
or even years.
I will stay here until I pay back
father's debt.
Ok.
But I will find some work,
don't you worry.
I won't be a burden on you.
No no, I was wondering, we only
have a single bed in the house.
So how are we going to manage?
You can sleep comfortably outside,
I'll make do with the bed.
And don't stress about the food.
You cook well.
Whatever you cook,
I'll eat without a fuss.
Ok, since you've decided everything...
Learn some important rules about this city.
I know, I know, I've done my homework.
Good morning sir, please come.
- The bike keys.
- What do you mean, sir?
I mean, pack your stuff and get out,
Mr. Latecomer.
But sir, I don't know how
I always get late!
I follow all your rules.
I drive on the wrong side,
never give way to anybody.
I jump every other signal.
The other day I told you go to deliver
Shastri's order in Gandhinagar.
You went to Gandhi's house
in Shastrinagar!
Sir, this kind of thing happens.
Gandhi and Shastri were both
freedom fighters, after all.
Pinto's cafe! Pinto's cafe...
Yes, of course!
4 large double cheese peppy paneer.
Where? Tardeo fire brigade.
It will reach in 30 minutes, or it's free.
Thank you very much.
Pinto sir, give me one last chance, please.
Last.
Thank you, sir. Love you.
- 4 large double cheese peppy paneer!
- Coming up.
Charlie, switch off oven no. 2!
Breaking now! After he defrauded the banks
of 40 billion rupees...
A look-out notice has been issued against
playboy industrialist Makwana.
This thug of Hindustan has been missing
for the last 10 days.
Final call for Hong Kong!
- Ya ya, yes.
- Please proceed to gate number 36B, ma'am.
Anybody else for Hong Kong?
Banana?
You don't like banana, Mr. Makwana?
What are you doing?
Watch where you go.
Guys, the pizza is here!
Shit man, shit!
Let's go, Let's go, come on.
Get my hat.
- Hey, hurry up.
- Where's the damn helmet?
Excuse me, who do I give these pizzas to?
The pizza guys are gone,
didn't you hear the bell?
Bell? What bell, sir?
Sir, sir stop, please don't do this.
Please take these pizzas
or I'll lose my job.
People might lose their lives,
you only care about your job?
Can't you see it's an emergency?
Sir I've got an idea, give these to
the people you save!
They must be hungry.
Let's go.
Won't they be hungry?
And if they don't like it cold,
there's a fire there to heat it up!
Excuse me sir,
would you like these pizzas?
You're fired.
Mr fireman! Please take these pizzas,
they are still hot.
Why are you following us?
We don't want pizza!
Today is my last chance.
I want to keep my job!
- I beg you, go away.
- Sir, please!
Sir, please stop.
Pinto sir!
Pinto sir!
You mean everything burned down?
Nothing is left?
But sir, if I may say so, you should
have called the fire brigade.
I did call them, but nobody came.
They didn't come?
You should sue the fire department.
Even they should have
a 30-minute rule.
I just wish I knew how that damn
fire started...
Charlie, you idiot! You ruined everything.
I told you to switch off the oven,
didn't you hear me?
And now the latest from Mumbai!
A pizza boy caused a collision between
a fire engine and a police van.
Wanted industrialist Makwana escaped
in the commotion.
A 30 minute delivery
proves costly for the whole nation.
Sorry, sir.
Bloody fool!
Mona? 18 calls, Mona.
I told you baby, they'll get you.
Are you with me or not?
Say please.
Oh come on.
Say it, or I'll cut the call.
Ok, ok, please.
Not like that. Say it like you mean it,
from your heart.
Please... darling.
Let it be, looks like you aren't serious.
Excuse me? Are you eating a banana
while talking to me?
How did you know?
Only bananas make this sticky-slurpy sound.
It is disgusting... for god's sake.
Makwana, what do you have against bananas?
Come on darling, you know
I don't like bananas.
I hate bananas.
Don't shout. Where are you right now?
The same place I brought you the first time.
Alright, I'm coming.
Bring some clothes and a chess board.
And spit that banana out and
wash your mouth and come. Dirty... dirty...
Chess board?
Give me cash, cheque, or change.
He'll have to return the loans.
The money is gone, the man is gone...
And what did the people get,
a fisherman's calendar?
You're yelling as if Makwana
stole your own money.
This is an insult, it is the citizens' money.
Remove the mic.
- Get out from my show.
- How can you talk to me like that?
This is my show.
Yes, I can talk like this.
Did you get the chess board?
The cops are everywhere.
I've barely managed to reach here.
And you're worried about chess?
Seriously?
He wants a Chess board.
You could've brought a small one.
You know chess makes me think better.
I don't understand,
why do I even give in to you?
My love, you know girls can't resist me.
Really? Then why didn't you call those girls?
I didn't call those girls
because you are special.
- I am not sure.
- About what?
- I am scared.
- What are you scared of, my love?
We're all going to die one day.
Why have fear, my dear?
Shut up, Makwana.
Darling...
You are going to get a teak wood coffin
made for me.
- Will you get lost already?
- I want to get lost.
If you get me a teak wood coffin,
I'll get lost from India.
I am listening.
Sit down.
Spell it out.
If you put me in a coffin and
take me to the Diu coast...
I'll take a boat straight to Dubai.
Come on, come on.
No.
A coffin won't work.
Why?
There's a dog squad at every checkpoint.
They are checking everything Makwana.
The Hollywood film Monster Monkey
has smashed box office records...
Well, think of something, my love.
In it's very first week, the high budget film...
Gorilla!
Gorilla?
If we put you in a gorilla suit...
And act like that this gorilla is going to
perform at the Diu Dussehra Fair.
Nobody will doubt a thing.
You mean I'll be on the streets
in a gorilla suit and...
Makwana.
The time for jokes is over.
The police has already
reached your Alibaug house.
Sooner or later, they'll be here as well.
Your choice.
12 hours in a gorilla suit...
or a lifetime in jail.
Uncle, what are you cooking?
It smells great.
There's abuses, punches, kicks .
What would you like?
Uncle you have every right to be angry,
but it was not my mistake.
Not your mistake?
People can mistakes with an order,
but you burned down the whole restaurant!
Helped that fugutive Makwana escape.
What next, riots in the city?
I have booked your ticket back home.
Get going next week.
You want me to go back?
Yes!
Ok, I'll go. I'll leave the moment
I have 15 lac rupees.
- How much have you saved so far?
- 15, 560 rupees!
Wow...
I've got nothing left to burn down, anyway.
Hear me out, uncle...
We have our truck, Girnar Express.
Hey!
Don't you dare talk about that truck.
Uncle, you have just bought the truck.
You don't even have a cleaner.
- So?
- So, here I am!
When there's a well in the backyard,
why go around with a begging bowl?
- Here, keep an eye on the vegetables.
- Yes.
Oh, Laakha and Waghela!
- Hello, Karsanbhai.
- What brings you here?
- We have come to fetch you.
- Why?
Please come in, have some water.
Laakha and Waghela,
my childhood friends.
They've come to take me to the village.
What do you mean?
Every November, there's a tri-motorcycle race
in our village.
But this time our champion
is out with a fracture.
It's a matter of the village's honour.
Don't worry uncle, go ahead.
If necessary, I will drive Girnar Express.
Don't even touch Girnar!
Just wash it.
And like this... from a distance.
- With a pipe, got it?
- But why? Don't you trust me?
It took me two years' hard work to
get the loan approved.
I am still waiting for
the national permit.
Uncle, you are getting emotional needlessly.
Look at me, even I have to repay my dad's loan
but I'm not worried!
You just listen.
I'll be back in two-three days.
If there's a booking in the meantime,
note it in the diary.
But do not touch Girnar.
Please avoid your usual antics.
Come on uncle, I am your nephew.
One day I'll make you proud.
You'll say, 'Well done, Charlie!'
Yeah, right.
Hail the divine mother!
Seems like a smart boy.
Not smart, oversmart.
Please help, it's very urgent.
I hear you ma'am...
but we only do local jobs.
Okay, thank you.
Madam, where do you want to go?
Diu, but he said that you guys
only do local jobs.
Don't listen to him,
he never travels far.
He's actually got piles, that's why.
Make your booking with me!
My uncle will be here in two days,
and will complete your delivery.
I don't have that long, you'll have to leave
tomorrow morning.
What is your delivery?
- Fridge, sofa, almirah, TV?
- A gorilla.
Gorilla... you mean, a monkey?
A big monkey.
He is performing at the Dussehra Fair.
Nice.
Can you take him?
I'll give you fifty thousand.
Fifty?
Okay, seventy five.
Seventy five!
3 months' EMIs in one trip!
Well done, Charlie!
I'll do it, madam! Absolutely!
But you'll have to pay extra
for the toll.
Okay, that's fine.
But one thing ma'am, I hope
your monkey isn't wild.
Oh no, he's very sweet. You'll see.
Very funny, I can't do this.
I'm not going to do this.
You look cute.
Don't be shy.
I'm the CEO of 250 companies and
an empire of 15 thousand crores.
MD Makwana in a monkey suit.
And you're telling to not be shy, wow!
Come on, it's all set in Diu,
JD is waiting for you.
The fabric is so tight.
I am sweating from all the wrong places,
and this itch... it's killing me.
- Just scratch me.
- But where?
Anywhere... but scratch!
The truck is here.
Stop behaving like a child.
Get ready, wear everything,
meet me in the garage.
- Everything is ready for you.
- Yeah yeah... thanks.
Don't be afraid, he is harmless.
Shake hands with Charlie, Toto baby.
Toto?
Nice name!
Hi Toto.
I told you, he's very sweet.
Take it easy.
Toto baby, stand up!
Madam, he understands everything!
Toto, stand on one leg.
Madam, this is superb!
Jiggy jiggy!
Wonderful, madam.
- Do the boobsy boobsy!
- Boobsy boobsy?
Toto, shaky-shaky boobsy-boobsy
together.
Fantastic!
Faster now, shaky-shaky boobsy-boobsy,
shaky-shaky boobsy-boobsy...
Okay, enough. You've understand now, right?
I have seen monkeys before,
but I've never seen such a well-trained gorilla.
Incredible.
- Let's get going?
- Yes.
But madam, you didn't tell me
it's such a heavy parcel.
How will we put him in the truck?
- Madam push! Careful!
- Push!
Harder, harder ma'am.
One minute.
Who's this joker, baby?
Got it, got it.
Madam give me hand, please.
We did it.
Here's the address and
the gorilla's papers.
I'll meet you at the Dussehra Fair.
Okay, madam.
Hey, what's that?
- What's inside?
- See for yourself, sir.
It's amazing. You wouldn't have
ever seen anything like it.
- Okay fine.
- No, please check properly sir.
Just leave, man. Don't be cheeky.
- Look at the traffic jam behind you.
- You haven't even checked!
He's crazy sir, he says I haven't checked
the truck properly.
- What's in the truck?
- A gorilla sir.
- Gorilla?
- He's an artist!
He's going to dance at the Diu Dussehra Fair.
Take a look!
We are looking for a fugitive,
not a monkey.
- Get moving.
- But what if...
The fugitive is escaping
in a gorilla suit?
What's he saying?
Sir, odd things happen nowadays.
You get air in chip packets.
Soap in mobile phone boxes.
A man in a woman's dress.
Well, what if you're an idiot
dressed as a man?
Quiet.
Do I look like I'm joking?
Get lost!
Get going or I'll fine you.
Sir, think about it...
You aren't doing your duty properly.
Bloody idiot... what an idiot.
A checkpost at every corner...
Always asking for passport, PAN card,
Aadhar card...
That's why I had to do that drama.
Otherwise he would've asked
for my permit.
And our truck doesn't have
a permit yet.
Shit.
Did you just say... 'shit'?
Maybe I'm hearing things.
What are you looking at, Toto?
Do you know who that is?
MD Makwana!
Champion of fugitives.
He just vanished with billions.
I have learned one thing.
Those who take a loan in billions,
leave the country.
And those who take a loan in millions,
leave the world.
Like my father.
Let it be. What do you know
about loans?
We've hit the highway now, sir.
Say Ta-ta to Mumbai, Toto!
What happened, Toto?
You're very moody.
You were sad, now you're happy.
But I don't get why your facial expression
is always the same.
I'm getting hungry.
You know Indore's food
is the best in the world.
My favourite is the bitter samosa.
Let's stop at a nice eatery.
You can also eat some fruit.
What's your favourite? Bananas, right?
Don't worry, we'll get some.
You really like bananas that much?
We'll get really good ones up ahead.
Don't worry, I'll even get you
a banana milkshake.
A banana split ice-cream!
What are you doing?
Control, Toto... sit!
Damn it... it's a puncture.
I can't do this.
We'll have to wait for help.
Why are you making so much noise?
What?
What?
Football?
Toto, is this a time to play football?
You know how to change the tyre?
What? Open the lock?
You won't run away, right?
Too good.
Mona madam said you're a circus monkey,
but you should work in a garage.
My respect for your whole species
has gone up today.
I feel there's a human inside you,
who's dying to come out.
If you could talk, it would
really be amazing.
Try once! Like A for Apple...
B for Banana.
Really, you are too good.
What a monkey!
Sir, a cargo plane's engine failed
near Sasan village.
Ram Singh, I am a ranger,
not an engineer.
Can't you see my knight is trapped?
Sir, the plane has crashed.
It was carrying the Ugandan gorilla
for the Junagarh Zoo.
- Remember that circular, sir?
- What are you talking about?
Hello? Alpha, come in.
- Sir this is Beta.
- Speak better.
Sir, not better! I mean, the alpha-beta Beta!
Got it Beta, what's the information?
Sir, both pilots have regained consciousness,
but the gorilla for the zoo is missing!
What's the location?
- The small hill in Zone 6.
- Wait, I am coming there.
Come on, Ram Singh.
I still don't know why they
fired me from the call center.
One evening, a lady customer
called and asked, 'what's the plan'?
I told her, there's no plan.
I'll finish my shift, go home,
eat dinner and sleep!
She got mad at me!
How would I know she was
asking about the mobile SIM plan?
Oh no Toto, looks like we are
out of luck again.
No more diesel.
It's not my fault!
Anyone can run out of diesel.
Wait here.
I'm stuck with such an idiot!
I have scratched myself red!
Get me out of this! I'm itching all over.
We're okay! There's a petrol pump
on the other side of the bridge.
I just need a little help from you.
Come out and push the truck!
- You bloody...
- What did you say?
Ah... B for Banana!
Superb! Keep trying...
You'll learn before we reach Diu.
Now come, push.
Push hard and jump in quickly!
Come on, get going.
Give it all you've got! Come on, tiger.
What are you doing? Give it some strength!
Can't even give a little push?
What happened?
Lost your breath?
Come on, give it all...
Toto... Toto...
Oh... sorry... I forgot...
Where has this guy come from?!
If you weren't there today,
who would push the truck?
That's why it is said...
Two is better than one.
Full tank.
Ladies and gentlemen, boy and girls,
from China or Japan...
- This is an old story!
- Well, tell us a new story then!
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello.
- Three and half thousand rupees.
- What?
- Three thousand five hundred rupees.
- Yes...
Oh no!
I forgot to take an advance
from Mona madam.
- Do you have a pipe?
- What?
I'll get a bucket.
I'm stuck here, and you want a bath?
Not for a bath dummy,
to take the diesel out.
Uncle, don't do this, please.
I have to take this gorilla to Diu...
But I promise I'll pay you
on the way back.
Is he saying something?
He's saying I'm honest!
He guarantees it.
The gorilla guarantees it?!
He's no ordinary gorilla.
He's the superstar of the Diu Fair!
He's fully trained!
He even talks! Want to hear it?
Toto, talk!
- B for Banana....
- Hold on... no going bananas.
Get the money and take your truck.
B for Banana...
Shit.
Thank you, thank you.
Go on, collect the money.
Thank you. Thank you.
Toto... Toto! Looks like it's time
for you to take the stage.
Looks like it's time for you

Banana.
Toto, you want bananas, boy?
"One two one two dance."

Hello.
You work for the Diamond circus?
No you silly boy, I am the owner!
Singing, dancing, juggling,
dual performance... everything.
Diamond circus.
I saw your show.
Your monkey is a real performer!
He is the Hrithik Roshan of monkeys!
- That's true.
- Very good.
How much did you get him for?
I mean... If we were to do a deal...
then how much would I have to pay?
Toto is not for sale.
Here, Toto my boy!
Farm fresh bananas.
Here...
Go on... eat.
Oh my God... save me.
If we put him to work together,
we can split the profits fifty-fifty.
No, he's not mine.
Great! Just tell them you got off to pee...
he opened the cage
and escaped.
Listen...
I am giving you three lac rupees
as advance.
Three lac, and this is just an advance.
I can stretch it up to 15 lacs.

Of course, go ahead.
That's my card.

That was the surprise show by Padma!
Your favourite Padma!
Exit from the left side,
the next show starts in half an hour.
Hey, Paddu.
Paddu baby, what happened?
What's this new episode?
Patel, this was my last show.
I miss my family a lot.
That's it. No more.
What do you mean, no more?
Hey baby!
I've got an amazing item for you!
Toto!
It's going to be a smash hit.
Diamond Circus will shine again with
Padma and Toto!
High-five!
Patel, it has been 4 years.
I've cleared all my debts,
now please let me go.
And settle my dues... please.
Settle what exactly?
You've only paid the interest so far.
What about the principal?
Baby, don't worry.
Paddu baby, listen carefully...
I've got a scheme for you.
It will even everything out.
You...
Should...
Marry me.
Praise to the Lord!
- Have you lost it?
- There's no hurry.
Take your time, think about it.
Ask your mother if you like.
"One two... one two dance"
Hello... Hello... Madam...
- Who is it?
- Myself Charlie.
Charlie who?
The show is over, come tomorrow.
No, I need your help.
That Patel has stolen my truck
and my Toto.
Patel is a slimy scoundrel.
Why have you come here?
Go to the police.
The police ask too many questions.
He has the keys to my truck.
Please get it for me and I'll be sorted.
I promise I can help you too.
I know where he keeps his money.
You were eavesdropping on us?
- I was just...
- Who are you mister?
We have a transport business.
I need to get that monkey
to Diu by evening.
I'll be in big trouble if I don't.
I can drop you somewhere too,
if you like.
So you're going to
steal from Patel's office?
Of course.
Just get my keys. Please...
Don't think so much. Whenever I think a lot,
all hell breaks loose.
Pattu...
The weather changed so soon.
What brings you here, Padma baby?
Gramflour sweets.
- From my mother.
- Really?
Your mother is smarter than you.
Come near me.
Let's sit and eat together.
Care for a head massage?
You mean it? A head massage!
Who's there?
Hey kid... what happened?
That thief got into your office.
Hey... shut the main gate.
Charlie!
Catch them!
Sir, what's the big deal if the gorilla
stays in the wild for a few days?
He's not a wild gorilla, he's a zoo animal.
He won't survive.
Listen to the bird calls, for any movement.
Sir, you must have come across
many wild animals?
Don't ask Ram Singh, I've lost count.
One fine evening in the
Bandhavgarh forest...
Beta calling Alpha!
Yes, speak beta.
The boss called from the head office.
He wants an update on the gorilla,
come back soon.
Be alert.
Sir, what do we do if we suddenly
see the gorilla?
What can we do, whatever has to be done,
the gorilla will do!
That's how life is. It can fail anytime,
like a mobile phone network.
Why are you driving so badly?
Are you new to this?
What can I do?
The road is full of holes.
That's why I am telling
you to keep your eyes on the road.
But where are we going?
Adri village is up ahead.
I'll take a bus from there to Rajkot.
Rajkot?
- Hey...
- What's he upto?
I think he wants to meet you.
Padma meet Toto.
Maybe he's shy of you.
What kind of driving is that?
A black cat just crossed our path,
so I had to stop.
What do you mean?
A black cat brings bad luck.
Don't you know?
What say, Toto?
Toto?
Toto!
Toto!
Toto...
What happened, Toto?
Say something.
What happened?
Is there a hospital for animals nearby,
any veterinarian?
Let's go to Gadu. There's a zoo there.
I've heard there's an old doctor too.
Unless you take the full medicine,
I am helpless.
Do you see, it's a very deep wound.
And your haemoglobin has
reduced drastically.
See the colour of your blood,
it's all white.
This really looks like it's
from the British era.
- Hello?
- What do you mean, hello?
Anybody here?
We need to get this gorilla treated.
Just one second.
- You want to get him treated?
- Yes.
You really want to get him treated?
Yes.
One minute, I'll come from there...
Please don't go anywhere.
Just watch your step,
the path is a bit uneven.
Hello... you can't come inside.
Why?
Because he's a 'he', and you're a 'she'.
Gender matters... sorry.
Come... Carefully...
Careful, always be patient with patient.
- Doctor... will he be alright?
- Let me check, don't worry.
My God.
Please call his relatives.
He is no more, boss.
What?
Toto!
He's back, he's back!
Mr. Gorilla, can you tell me
where you are hurt?
Doctor, I think he can hear us a bit.
Yeah...
He can hear in small doses.
Yes!
Charging... Move back...
One...
Two...
Three!
Tell me! Where did you get hurt?
He fainted again!
- Don't worry.
- Doctor... he'll recover, right?
Of course... Of course.
He just needs a small booster shot.
Come Padma,
I'll drop you to the bus stop.
And your Toto, is he okay?
Yes, but the doctor said he'll take some time
to regain consciousness.
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.
Isn't the doctor a bit strange?
- What do you mean?
- I mean...
He's piss drunk.
Thank you for everything you've done for me.
Don't mention it.
Of all the people I have met,
only you helped me.
In fact, you should run away with me.
Patel is a dangerous man.
I'll have to go back to Gadu, for Toto.
Have some bread, Toto...
Or an apple Toto?
Banana!
Oh God!
Spare me, for God's sake...
You want to play chess?
Why didn't you say so earlier?
You wreaked havoc.
Good boy.
Here we are, Adri bus depot.
So shall I leave?
Yes.
Sure?
Yeah.
Won't you give me your mobile number?
Well, I don't have a mobile.
You know, it causes cancer.
Don't laugh, I've read it.
Always stay the way you are.
Intelligent, right?
No, mad. Completely crazy.
Bye.
Check and mate!
You're a genius, you ape.
You're a champion,
you defeated Dr. Ganatra.
Dr. Ganatra!
Let me call Batook Lal, he doesn't know.
Hello, Ranger Soli Topi speaking.
Hey Topi, you think you're some
Vishwanathan, right?
You've lost to me 9 times
in the last 3 weeks, Dr. Nobody.
Just stay there,
I am getting a champion to defeat you.
So you want to shoot from
someone else's shoulder.
By God, Ganatra...
Put the phone down, drunkard.
One for the road man. Cheers!
Speak.
Paddu darling!
This bird has flown the nest, Pattu.
GSRTC Bus no. 1825 from Adri to Rajkot,
has left the bus depot.
Do whatever you want,
you won't catch me again.
Okay, but I'll catch your
video game hero.
Hey!
Paddu, you know that
if you snooze, you lose!
Praise to the Lord!
Hello? Hello?
Where is the bus for Rajkot?
- Gone to Rajkot.
- You mean, it left?
Yes my friend, it has.
Yes, where do you want to go?
Surprise!
Where are you off to after
stealing my girl, boy?
Take this!
Give me my bag.
Take him away.
Mona madam, it's you!
Who are these people?
Where were they taking you?
Where's Toto?
He's at Dr. Ganatra's.
What doctor?
Nothing to worry about,
just a small injury on his head.
- What happened to his head?
- Don't worry, the doctor is with him.
Take me to him, right now.
Come on!
Madam, just a moment...
Hey you...
My bag...
This way... come on.
Thank you.
What happened here?
Paddu.
Where's Charlie?
What did you do to him?
He went to some Dr. Ganatra
with that madam.
Madam?
She is very dangerous!
She has an imported gun.
She even fired it!
Oh, stop!
Arvind, what's going on?
Why's there a bear in place of a monkey?
- He's the bear?
- Of course.
I don't know what's happening.
Please keep the show going.
- What do you mean, keep going?
- Just look at the crowd!
If they get angry, they'll beat us up.
What's your problem, man?
If you're afraid of fire,
why did you agree to the role?
You ruined the show!
At first, he was running scared...
Then suddenly, something happened.
As if his inner gorilla suddenly woke up.
I managed to save myself luckily.
It was dangerous.
And Toto?
If I didn't have my bike, I would be
resting in pieces.
Where's Toto right now?
I told you, Sasan village.
Come.
Toto!
Toto!
The whole village is deserted.
Maybe there's a cricket match today.
What?
There's nobody outside!
Go ask somebody where Toto is.
Whom do I ask?
All I can see is chicken.
Walk ahead.
You'll find somebody!
Toto!
Toto!
Toto!
Come inside!
There's a mad monkey in the village.
Yes! Where is he?
In the snack shop on the next street.
Come!
But why are we going to Sasan village?
That lady is already there,
and so is Charlie.
That's exactly why.
Something fishy is going on.
That lady has a gun. Hurry up.
What are you saying?
That lady has a gorilla...
And a gun too! She's dangerous.
Actually...
- I think we should...
- One second...
We should go to the ranger.
Please drive fast.
O all powerful monkey god! Throw away
my bad deeds and give me good sense.
I'm in real trouble...
Eat whatever you want,
but please let me go!
Help me mummy!
You stay here, I'll fetch him.
Makwana.
Baby, what has happened to you?
Are you okay, baby?
Wow!
I'm very impressed.
Just like a real gorilla.
Nice. Very good.
Shall we go now?
Okay... that's a bit much, Makwana.
You don't have to act so much
in front of me.
Come. Come on, let's go.
Come on... come on!
You're growling at me!
What's all this?
You are getting on my nerves now.
Come out when you are done
with your mood swings.
I am waiting.
Just can't believe it.
Why isn't he coming out?
He must be angry, he's a bit moody.
He's an animal, what can we do?
Let me try once.
Come on. Come on.
- Show some strength.
- I am trying.
Thank you Ganatra.
You have won this round.
I've been looking for your chess champion
for the last 6 hours.
Let's toast to that!
Come on.
- Let's party yaar.
- Just sit.
Just a minute, something's not right.
If this is the zoo's gorilla...
Why was Charlie taking him to the Diu Fair?
We'll find out in Diu. But first, we need
to get his medical done.
Drop me off at the big police station
in Diu.
No problem. Come on!
Okay let's go.
You guys be careful, the gorilla inside him
can wake up at any time.
I'm telling you, that woman is trouble sir.
She fired a gun at the bus depot,
and she has also stolen the zoo's gorilla.
Which gorilla?
The one that our government
ordered from Uganda.
Can you believe they are
making him dance in a fair?
Thank god the ranger caught him
and he's now at the right place.
Which ranger? What are you
talking about?
Ranger Soli Topi.
He has taken him to the hospital
for a medical.
Sir, I am really scared.
That woman is with Charlie.
Sir, please come with me.
Hurry up!
The Diu Dussehra Fair!
- Dr. Ganatra!
- Yeah, you've come, come let's go.
Where's the gorilla?
Where's he?
Looks like he escaped.
Escaped?
Sir, maybe the dose was inadequate.
So he woke up and got away.
I warned you guys.
His inner gorilla can wake up
at any time.
Sit. "Woke up, ran away"!
The Diu Dussehra Fair.
Mona madam, thank you very much.
This is the first job I have completed.
I am very sorry for all the
stress I caused you.
Just let me know if you ever need me.
Yes okay. Let's go.
Please settle my account.
I'll just relieve myself.
Hold on...
Take Toto with you,
he'll need to relieve himself too.
Come.
Take this urinal, I'll take that one.
Toto, I am really going to miss you.
Give it your all in your performance!
You're the best.
What happened, is it not coming out?
Stop, stop. Stay away.
Stay away please.
There are other gorillas here!
Who are you?
Toto?
Toto! You scared me.
Who's the other one?
He must be around here somewhere.
- Come on!
- Why would he go to the fair?
Girl?
Boobsy boobsy, shaky shaky?
Mona madam!
Mona madam clearly told me
to take you only till Diu.
How do I explain it to him?
Namaste? What are you doing?
Live long Toto!
My blessings are always with you.
Let me go, I've got other work.
I have to go back home.
Toto... Look!
The other one has also come.
- Mona madam, you have put me in a jam.
- What's happening, where's Toto?
- His family has come to take him back.
- What?
Topi...
Finish the job!
Two gorillas with one shot.
Not two, just one gorilla with one shot.
That's why I say,
don't drink on duty Ganatra!
Sir, put your gun down and see.
No, no, no.
You said there's only one, there are two.
In my opinion, we shouldn't meddle
in their family affair.
Have you completely lost it?
- If you value your life, run!
- But where's Toto?
Come on, you want to fight?
He seems to be getting horny.
Don't come ahead.
You've hit the bull's eye again.
Bull's eye.
How many gorillas came for
the Junagarh zoo from Uganda?
Sir, one gorilla.
- Are you sure?
- Yes sir.
That second gorilla belongs to
that guy with the truck.
Don't stress about him,
that's his personal gorilla.
How many times do I need to tell you?
Mona! I hate bananas!
Makwana, thank God.
- I had almost forgotten your face.
- Oh really?
You couldn't find a bigger idiot
to get the job done?
Do you know what he put me through?
- Do you even know?
- I am sorry.
But there's no time for all this.
We need to head to the jetty.
Makwana!
I thought there's some
humanity in this gorilla.
But it was the devil instead!
I am sorry Charlie, but we can't
leave a witness behind.
No madam, please don't kill me.
I won't tell anyone!
Turn.
Makwana sir, what did I do to you?
I took you to the doctor.
Gave you medicine, fed you bananas.
Fed me bananas?
Let me feed you some bullets.
Please don't do this.
Please... please... Makwana sir.
Mr. Makwana?
Hello? Sir?
Padma, thank God you're here.
Everything is going wrong here.
But why did you get the cops?
I was going to return your bag.
- I have come for you.
- Really?
You know, the ranger took your gorilla
away safely.
No Padma, he is not a gorilla.
What do you mean?
Sir, he was gorilla earlier,
but not anymore.
- If not a gorilla, then what is he?
- He's a human!
Look, I had a man with me
who was dressed as a gorilla.
So there's no gorilla?
There is a gorilla,
but the other one.
What's this nonsense?
Sir, it was Makwana inside the costume.
Now who is this Makwana?
The man who swindled billions of rupees!
And the government has put a price
of 15 lacs on his head.
Sir please arrest him.
He didn't even pay my money.
Did you see him?
Yes sir, with my own eyes!
He has taken my truck and
gone towards the jetty.
The very special event of Junagarh,
celebrated in November,
A grand welcome to you
at the annual tri-motorbike race.
We'll see who is the fastest!
All the racers have started.
All are trying to be ahead.
Ramji bhai is ahead...
but Chhagan bhai is close...
and Karsan bhai is
trying to snatch the lead.
Karsan bhai has maintained the lead.
He is running away with it!
Oh my God!
Oh, you're looking lovely.
But I have one request, darling.
Don't ever bring me stupid
ideas about gorillas or monkeys.
Looks you are in shock.
Come on Makwana.
You're done with the gorilla suit.
Now don't hold on to its tail.
My darling, gorillas don't have tails.
But you are absolutely right,
past is past and future is future.
But tell me, where are we...
Police! Mona?
Sir, there's Makwana... arrest him.
Not this boy again, God,
not him again!
Peace bro... world peace.
Maki... that's JD, my brother.
JD.... Maki.
JD, the grand organiser!
Why have you brought them here?
The boy has recognised you,
we can't take any chances.
You guys get going,
I'll take care of them, all the best.
- Good.
- Attention!
Who are these guys?
Who are you?
Myself Soli Topi.
Sasan-Gir, forest department.
We followed this truck here.
There was a gorilla sighted
in the Diu city area.
And I suspect this is a
case of poaching.
Because the skin is here,
but where is the body?
Topi...
I told you this was a bad idea.
Dr. Ganatra, behave yourself.
Not her, next to her... MD Makwana.
MD Makwana!
Wow! The criminal who everyone from
Dubai to Delhi was looking for...
You caught him in Diu, well done!
Tomorrow's headlines are going to be...
'Loan fraudster's escape failed....
'The fugitive got jailed.'
And inspector, your promotion is guaranteed.
Topi!
That's the boy with the truck
who brought the gorilla to my clinic.
What did you do to the gorilla?
- Nothing.
- Topi sir, that was not a gorilla.
What rubbish!
How can he not be the gorilla?
I saw him with my own eyes.
You are absolutely right sir,
there was a gorilla but the other one.
That's what I am asking,
where is the other gorilla?
- But that was a different one.
- One minute...
Let's start from childhood.
The gorilla that you
brought to my clinic...
- Where is that one?
- Right here.
He's no gorilla,
he is a pigeon...
And these two scoundrels
are helping him fly away.
This policeman here is helping
this fugitive Makwana.
Absolutely right!
That's it my boy,
that's the way it should be.
Leave quickly, the boat is ready.
I'll stop them here.
No mistakes this time, kill him.
Inspector!
Not now, after I leave.
You know I hate violence.
Come on, baby.
Hail the divine goddess!
Hail the divine goddess!
- Uncle is here too?
- What's this group?
What games are you up to,
you two bit boy?
I clearly told you to wash Girnar,
that too from a distance.
And you are driving
it all over the place!
What are you doing with this fugitive?
No Uncle, you've got it all wrong.
These people have trapped me!
This madam said,
drop him to Diu, I'll pay a lot.
I didn't know that this man is getting
away with the entire country's money.
- Did we get our money?
- No, not at all.
Then I can't let him go.
Gather around him,
hail the mother goddess!
Mona, where are you?
Mona! Mona!
Somebody get me out of here! JD!
Stop spinning him!
Let go.
Uncle, what are you doing?
I will give you a lot of money, let me go.
You stay there, that's where you belong.
I will give you guys a lot of money,
somebody just get me out of here.
Charlie!
Charlie!
Charlie...
Charlie... Charlie!
Mona darling... up here.
Mona, come on Mona.
Get me out from here.
- Hurry up! Mona, please hurry up!
- Hold on, one sec.
Put me down.
Charlie... Makwana!
Come on, Mona, come on!
Hurry, hurry!
- Stop, Makwana!
- Hey stop, or I'll shoot.
Come on!
- Come on, baby.
- Careful!
I love you India but sorry!
Come on go... let's go.
Bananas? Who brought bananas?
You know I hate bananas.
Hurry up.
This cursed boy won't go!
Bloody hell.
Drop the rope.
- Drop the rope!
- No, no.
- Please don't shoot.
- This is the last warning.
Oh Mona darling...
And that's how Makwana's story ends.
Charlie got his reward of
15 lac rupees.
And he paid off his father's debt.
Well done, Charlie!
Perhaps that's why they say...
Those who don't do anything,
do great things.
