Sunny...
Brother, I'll be kicked out of the team
if I don't play.
My job...
You're going to be fine.
You'll be fine. Just stay with me.
Call Preet.
Please call Preet.
I am Harpreet Kaur.
Used to play center forward for India.
But this story isn't about me.
It's about Sandeep Singh.
Brother Bikram,
I've heard that the coach
doesn't have a television,
so he punishes us for his entertainment.
Shut up, Sandeep.
We'll get whacked if he hears you.
There'll be no stopping me if you
even look at the girls' team again!
I'll break your bones.
Three minutes.
Get six Samosas from Changat Ram. Run.
Samosas...
Samosas...
- Changat Ram's?
- Mangat Ram's?
Which ones?
Where did you get them from?
Mangat Ram.
What did he do, Coach? Why the punishment?
I asked for Samosas from Changat Ram.
He got them from Mangat Ram instead.
What difference does it make?
It's the same shop
with two separate counters.
Everything is cooked in the same kitchen.
And it's a great kitchen, I must say!
The poor boy is unnecessarily
getting his back broken.
So?
Doesn't look like...
He ran away.
I don't think he's going to come back.
If he wants to play hockey in Shahbad,
this is where he'll have to come.
And his elder brother is here
to complete his punishment. Bikram!
Why quit playing hockey?
Your brother took your share
of punishment already.
I've decided, Mom.
There's no way
I'm going back to that Kartar.
Calm down.
Try to get some sleep. Come on.
O' merciful Lord
Let me stay at your feet
O' merciful Lord...
Gurcharan, he's just a kid.
He'll take up some other sport.
You over think and worry unnecessarily.
Can't help it.
I am a bit nervous
since we lost our house in the flood.
If you hadn't given us a place to stay--
Enough.
Talk about your house again and..
I'll keep Daljit and the kids here
and throw you out.
Who are you going to throw out?
This one, who else!
I raised him and made him a man.
And now he's trying to be my father.
Sit.
Fine.
Don't get angry.
Tea's getting cold.
O' merciful Lord
Let me stay at your feet
Let me stay at your feet
My brave child!
This entire farmland belongs to us.
Do whatever you like here.
Just don't let the birds
come near the crops.
We'll have lunch together.
- Do you know how to drive a tractor?
- Not yet.
I'll teach you.
I'm going to learn to drive a tractor.
Oh, no!
Yes!
Sandeep!
Let's go. We're getting late.
Your brother must be starving to death.
Hurry up.
Slow down, man.
I can't hold on to anything.
Both my hands are busy feeding you.
Gujji, my friend, I'll either die
in an accident if I let you ride
or die of hunger if you don't feed me now.
So, stop cribbing and focus on giving me
a bit of the pickle instead.
Really?
Stuff it all in then.
Hey! Not all of it.
- How are you doing, boys?
- Great.
Coach, I must say,
Bikram's turned out to be a good player.
I have trained him to be a good one.
How long do you want these kids
to be hanging from up here?
Stay put for four hours
or I'll beat you with your hockey sticks.
Heard that?
Four hours.
Take me along.
- Let me finish the Samosas first.
- I'm leaving.
No, wait.
Hey! He's gone!
That's enough.
Good evening, Coach.
Good evening, sir.
Preet, pass the ball. What are you doing?
Hurry up.
- Hold this.
- Take this.
Presenting!
Where's the pickle?
Why didn't you finish off
the Paratha as well?
What am I supposed to eat
the Paratha with?
With my love.
Hockey players shouldn't be eating
too much pickle.
Have fun while you can.
- Your time shall come too.
- It's time for me to leave now.
- Have some.
- No, thanks.
Where are you off to, Mr. Busy Person?
You got Samosas from Mangat Ram, right?
Keep hanging upside down.
You won't get to play hockey.
I told you to hold on to the bike,
not to lay it down.
Thanks to you, racing the bike!
The accelerator cable has snapped.
Your bike is from the ancient age.
This was expected. Now let me fix it.
Here comes the doctor of automobiles!
What the...
Did you get a shot in the rear, Doctor?
Pass the ball.
Stop staring at me.
Your mouth might just start watering
the grass on the ground.
Look up in the front
before flicking the ball.
Be glad it didn't hit you in the front.
You're Bikram's brother, right?
Right. Not your brother for sure.
This area is for players.
Mechanics are not allowed here.
I'm also a player.
Your brother would be ashamed
to hear that.
Not as good as him, but I too can play.
Oh, really!
Let's see how good a player you are then.
No, you must be tired.
I don't want you to lose
and feel embarrassed.
That's okay. Think of it
as some entertainment for yourself.
Let's do it.
Come on.
One-on-one.
Whoever scores, gets the ball.
You know what, you try first.
If I start the game, you won't get
anywhere close to the ball.
The game is what really is
worth falling for.
- Don't go wasting time after girls.
- It's been a long time since I practiced,
so I couldn't score.
You'll score if you have a goal in life,
or you'll just keep biting the dust.
- Ma'am...
- Harpreet.
Sandeep.
- Ma'am, can we talk in private?
- Why?
Just a little away from Gujji.
I don't want him to hear us.
I was just trying to act smart
in front of my friend.
I knew you'd beat me in hockey.
Anyhow, forget that now.
I was just trying my luck, but I failed.
You are not that bad.
If you practice next time,
you might just score a goal.
Will you play with me again?
Will you?
Follow me.
Our lives were about to change
in the next six months.
Those six months
were the best moments of my life
and perhaps, of his life as well.
Ouch.
Careful there.
This isn't a hockey stick.
- Keep it straight then.
- There you go.
In the age of mobiles and internet,
Yellow Printers can't stand
to compete in the business.
And Sandeep is of no help.
Have your meal and leave the rest to God.
Son.
Once you get selected for India
I am going to retire from this job...
- and we'll buy a new place for ourselves.
- What new place?
Well, I was just saying that...
What was I saying?
Tell him what I was talking about.
He was talking about Bikram
getting a place in the Indian team.
Right.
Yes, he will.
Of course, he will. Do you doubt that?
No.
I have no doubts.
Sometimes I address her
As my guiding light
Sometimes I address her
As the love of my life
Lost in love, I barely survive
Don't leave me Don't leave
I want to dwell in your eyes
I want to dwell in your eyes
I want to dwell in your eyes
You ran away nine years ago
to escape your punishment.
There's no place for a runaway like you
on this field. Get lost!
Clean that properly.
Sir, I want to play hockey.
Complete your nine years
of punishment first.
Don't touch a hockey stick until then.
- Clean that properly!
- Okay, sir.
This game called love, they say
Can't be won or lost, come what may
Keep going straight.
Not that way!
Go straight, I said. Keep going straight.
Love makes it tough to survive
You can see how love hurts...
Show me your hands...
I shall endure all the pain
I will never complain
This game called love...
Pass it.
...they say
Can't be won or lost...
Come on, let's go.
Idiots, can't play.
Costs you your life
Love makes it tough to survive...
Can I go home, sir?
You'll never be able to finish
the punishment if you go home. Get going.
Lost in love, I barely survive
Don't leave me
Don't leave
Sometimes I address her
As my guiding light
Sometimes I address her
As the love of my life
Lost in love...
Can I go home, sir?
Go.
Don't leave me
I think I should practice a bit more.
- Get going then.
- Okay.
Will you even play hockey
or just keep doing this?
He doesn't let me go
anywhere close to hockey.
Come play with me, then.
Now?
When else?
- It'll get dark in five minutes.
- Then let's play for five minutes.
Okay.
When you're away
I visit saints to set my soul free
If you ever leave
Leave a ring under a berry tree
When you're away
I visit saints to set my soul free...
That's fantastic!
If you ever leave
Leave a ring under a berry tree
I chant your name when I miss you...
I did it!
In the evenings, I kiss the moon too
I shall endure all the pain
I will never complain...
Hurry up.
This game called love, they say
Can't be won or lost...
- There comes my boy.
- I am exhausted.
Hop on.
Costs you your life
Love makes it tough to survive.
Don't worry, I'll talk to your coach.
It's your birthday tomorrow.
I'm sure he can give you a day off.
Mom, nobody forced me to play hockey.
I want to play for India.
There's nothing more I could've asked for.
What does it matter?
I'll play on this birthday too,
like all my other birthdays.
Just be quiet.
Let me do the talking.
Mom...
Is it done?
Yes, getting it.
- Delicious.
- Here you go.
- Brother.
- Yes?
I was wondering...
It's Preeto's birthday tomorrow.
If she could get a day off
from the practice...
After Preeto's father passed away,
didn't I help Ajit find a job in London?
Yes, you did.
I'll make sure Preeto plays for India.
If she wants days off,
you can go look for another coach.
No...
I'm outside your house.
Meet me for five minutes.
Brother, I have a trial
for the Indian team next week.
Who is it? Ajit? I told him
that you are trying out next week.
- Why is he asking again?
- Don't give him the phone.
His flight leaves in two minutes.
In two minutes, then?
No, the security check
will take ten minutes.
But you just said two minutes.
Hello, Ajit?
What is it?
Just wanted to see you.
Why?
Don't you see me on the ground every day?
I don't get to see you
with your hair loose.
Are you done now?
You know Gujji, my friend?
He says I sing well.
So?
So...
I wanted to sing for you.
- Oh, really?
- Yes.
- Go ahead.
- What?
- Go on. I'm listening.
- Yes.
But I haven't rehearsed.
Your five minutes are up.
You better rehearse and come next time,
and don't you dare sing for anyone else.
Sometimes I address her
As my guiding light
Sometimes I address her
As the love of my life
Lost in love, I barely survive
Don't leave me
Don't leave
Sometimes I address her
As my guiding light
Sometimes I address her
As the love of my life
Lost in love, I barely survive
Don't leave me Don't leave
I want to dwell in your eyes
I want to dwell in your eyes
So that was your brother, is it?
Tell him to come in front of me
- or I'll break your...
- Sir.
It's my fault.
So it's you?
Bloody coward!
You got back to hockey for a girl!
You've got to slog to play for India.
You won't get an invitation
where they'd be obliged
to have you go play hockey.
- Sir...
- Rascal!
You'll not reach anywhere in hockey.
He thinks he's too smart.
Get out!
Enjoying the show, are you?
Don't you dare call her again.
Get back to hockey you all.
You don't need to go with her.
If I don't, the coach won't let her in.
I came to apologize.
If you are done, you can leave.
Hear me out, please.
Shoot.
Look here.
You are making me lose my cool.
You are being quite civil. If I were you,
I would've not stopped at words.
What would you do if you were in my place?
Then I'd take a lesson from your brother.
Bikramjeet is going to play for India.
You don't even have a place
secured in the University Team.
- What can I expect from you?
- I'm putting in all my efforts in hockey.
I've taken a beating from Mr. Kartar
for 12 long years.
I didn't even realize how time ran out.
I never made it to the team.
You think you'll make it in hockey,
starting at this age?
What if I do?
Come back when you make it
and get yourself a job.
Harpreet is getting late for her practice.
Let's go, Preeto.
This isn't the last trial.
There'll be many more.
- I'll make sure you get selected.
- But what happened this time?
That doesn't matter.
I didn't get selected, that's it.
Now will someone tell me about Sandeep?
Sunny was going for hockey as an excuse
to meet some girl apparently.
Hockey wasn't just an excuse.
Shall I tell your stories?
Why are you dragging me into this?
Is Sandeep all right?
This is his problem.
If Sandeep gets in trouble,
he'll forget his own problems
and run after him.
Stop the car.
Sandeep is at the farm.
Go meet him.
Brother!
Look at me.
Look up.
I heard about your trial.
Are you okay?
Do you love her?
You'll get selected the next time.
For sure.
Should I talk to her family?
I already did.
When I make it big in hockey, get a job,
only then will I show them my face.
Job!
Dad was so hopeful
that I'd get selected for India
and then we could get a new house.
So that he could retire.
My time's up, Sunny.
Now this isn't possible.
It was all going fine until yesterday.
Now it feels like nothing will get better.
You have more of these balls?
- Yes, why?
- Where are they?
Over there.
- What happened?
- Stay there.
- Hit the ball.
- But the birds are gone..
Forget the birds, just hit the ball.
Go on.
No.
Hit it just like you did before.
Come back.
Go.
Come back.
Now hit both of them.
What's going on?
Hit them.
What the...
You promised to show up before them...
only after you become a successful
hockey player, right?
Yes, so?
Wash your face, then.
You have to show your face very soon.
How?
With your drag flick!
Give me that.
Get a ball.
Place it here.
When you run in like this...
dragging the ball with the stick
and then, hit the ball...
it is called a flick...
This is a drag flick?
Ever since uncle told me to keep
the birds away from the crops,
this is how I've been doing it.
This is the most difficult shot in hockey.
Even a good player takes years
to get it right.
And if you can hit it right
on this surface, then...
Then?
Then probably, one of our father's sons
could still play for India.
- But how will India come to know about me?
- From Patiala.
Shall we?
Take your stick, mister.
- Are you sure that's a drag flick?
- Yes, it is.
That's the building.
IIS, Patiala.
Go left.
Go left! Sukhi, lose the cover, go for it.
- Someone's here to meet you.
- Can't you see the practice is on?
Sorry for disturbing you, sir.
Sir! Welcome. What would I do
without the Hockey Federation!
I would've been a mere physical trainer
at some high school in Patna.
You underestimate yourself, Coach.
All thanks to you guys.
Excuse me?
Nothing. Tell me.
Mr. Harry.
You need to give a lecture on sports
and its impact on young minds
at Chandigarh University,
tomorrow evening.
Who ditched you at the last moment
that you had to come begging to me?
I told the Chairman that you'd know.
Cover him!
I'll take it as confirmed?
Sir, you know it's family time for me
in the evenings.
It's the Chairman's order.
Let him know...
I'll be there.
Sure, Coach.
All good, Coach?
What brings you here?
This is my younger brother, Sandeep.
Does he also need a lecture?
No.
Have a look at his drag flick.
He's very good at it.
- Which state?
- University, sir.
Why are you wasting my time?
I deserve a chance, sir.
Should I try out
university players of this country?
And give lectures at colleges?
Will you prepare the team for Olympics?
If I'm worth it, you'll get a good player.
And if I'm not,
you can vent out
all the frustration at me.
Bad luck.
Manpreet.
Come to the goalpost.
Let's get done with this.
Follow me.
What is it?
Why did you stop?
Do you want the Indian team's goalkeeper?
It's for the Indian team, so I'd rather be
tested by the Indian team's goalkeeper.
Sunny!
You know how they say it in my village?
"Make them run and make them bleed."
Don't you worry.
Only curses for you, no blood.
You, however,
will not be spared for wasting my time,
despite being a senior.
I shall make you run, and make you bleed.
Kamaldeep.
Come here, my boy.
Good.
You can go and rest.
You seem to be too small for him.
Keep focusing.
All good now, or do you also need
Dhanraj Pillay to wish you luck?
I'll give him a call.
Give it to me.
He who utters shall be happy, fulfilled...
Eternal is the Holy.
Go, Sunny.
If he can hit such a drag flick
on the grass, what will he do on the turf?
He'll tear up the net on the turf.
Hitting it hard isn't enough.
If you hit a goal
using the right technique,
then no one can keep you out.
Sir, I'll do the hard work
if you teach me the technique.
But how would that help?
To hit 20 drag flicks,
you would only need 5 minutes
in a 70-minute long match.
What do I do with you
for the rest of the time? Mollycoddle you?
- You'll have to become a defender.
- Make me one.
It's family time for him now.
Be on the ground at five.
Be a minute late
and I'll make you run and bleed.
- Sunny!
- Brother!
Go, live my dream.
Face your fate without a fright
Live less...
You're on time.
Fight, for tomorrow belongs to you...
You need strength in your legs
to play hockey.
Be strong, you have to survive too...
Go...
The basic rule of being a defender...
Ball in your "D" is like a bomb.
What is it?
- Bomb!
- Yes!
Get rid of it quickly.
It's like your girlfriend.
Don't let the opposing team near it.
- Right, partner?
- Yes.
India's jersey.
Mom. How does it look?
The heart soared but didn't score
Score a goal and let the heart soar
Open up...
Never commit on the ball
until the last second.
- It's as good as committing suicide.
- Right.
Well done! Come on...
Flicker Singh! Flicker Singh!
Our hockey king!
Flicker Singh! Flicker Singh!
Our hockey king...
If you play like this, the opponent's
knickers will be in a twist. Say what?
- Knickers will be in a twist.
- Yes. Go, one more.
Action on reaction. Use your brain.
Don't think like a buffalo,
think like a criminal.
What's happening around
Shouldn't bother you...
Go, go, come on.
Five seconds.
Very good.
Go back.
You need to reach your goal...
Come back, Sandeep. Forget that.
Concentrate on defense. Come back.
What's happening around
Shouldn't bother you
You have to flow like a raging river too
You need to reach your goal...
India! India!
Hockey! India!
Hold it tight.
Flicker Singh
Forget everything else
Your thought was great, I must say
I met you midway...
Three, two, one.
Don't stop at the shore
Keep swimming, stay afloat
The currents will lead you, I am sure
Booked your train tickets already?
Beg your pardon?
Don't worry if you haven't.
The Federation can always send you
in the luggage compartment.
I know the Federation's rule.
We are not allowed to play at night.
So, then?
if I don't score goals,
I'll not get selected.
I defend goals the entire day.
I thought I'd practice in the night.
I'd rather take a risk
and get selected in the team
than not take any risks and go back home.
Who the hell is he!
Running around like this won't help you.
What do you mean?
The Federation won't hold you accountable
for any of these balls.
And you are?
I am the Federation.
It's an honor, Mr. Chairman.
The match starts.
The Meerut versus Patiala match has begun.
I see guns in the hands of the audiences.
After dodging Harmeet,
he passed the ball to the center forward.
And... that's Meerut's first goal!
Nailed it!
Harmeet from the Patiala team is injured.
Sir, allow me.
Go.
The injured Harmeet has been replaced
by number four jersey, Sandeep Singh.
This is Meerut, mister.
Prakash welcomes Sandeep
by hitting with the ball.
Sandeep Singh appeals.
- Sandeep.
- Meerut trying to pressurize Patiala.
But don't you underestimate Patiala,
Mr. Nadeem.
Sandeep, leave it.
Sandeep might get a yellow card.
The referee seems like a landline phone
in the times of mobiles.
You better put that gun
back into your knickers.
I come from Bihar.
I can spit and make a hole
in your forehead.
His spit, not mine.
Patiala zero, Meerut one.
A good pass by Sandeep
to the center forward.
Number 19 is dragging the ball
towards the "D".
And...
And a foul for hitting inside the "D".
Short-corner for Patiala, Mr. Nadeem.
- Hello, sir.
- First chance for Patiala to score a goal.
Sir?
I'm looking out for players
for the Junior Indian team.
And Sandeep Singh
will take the short-corner.
Isn't he the one who practices at night?
Yes, sir.
Sandeep Singh ready
to play the short-corner.
Vijay makes a pass.
Golden opportunity for Patiala.
Sandeep Singh flicks
and scores a goal!
- The score is one all, Mr. Nadeem.
- Yes!
That fast a drag flick on the grass!
On the turf...
He'd tear through the net
on the turf, sir.
Another goal for Patiala
from the Penalty Corner.
Patiala three, Meerut one.
Sandeep Singh
has been scoring goals non-stop.
Plays great defense as well.
Mr. Nadeem, another goal for Patiala.
So, should I recommend him?
He's a temperamental player.
He could get disqualified easily.
Sandeep...
However, he can be a huge asset
even if he plays for only 15 minutes.
Sandeep...
Then prepare him to last for 70 minutes.
- The game will be over in fi ve minutes.
- Yes, sir.
Patiala leading with six goals.
Mr. Nadeem!
Spectators are getting more enthusiastic
for Patiala.
Sandeep Singh has another chance.
Will he score his eighth goal here?
Audience is excited.
And Indian player, Harpreet Kaur,
seems to have arrived here.
She played a great game
against Germany yesterday.
Sandeep...
The young lad got distracted
and missed the goal.
A great save by Meerut.
You should sit back and relax now.
The match is over.
Meerut has lost the game
in spite of saving this goal.
Well played, Sandeep Singh.
You distracted me.
Had you come earlier
you could've seen me score.
Then you would've
probably missed all the goals.
That's right.
You better not watch me play ever.
- What are you looking at?
- The Indian jersey looks good on you.
Looking at your progress
you better be prepared to wear one
very soon.
Once I get selected for India...
we'll have the biggest wedding in town.
- Followed by a honeymoon in Switzerland?
- Exactly.
- Three kids?
- Yes. Looking just like you.
Or one could be like me.
And which car shall we buy?
A sports car! The one with a sunroof.
- A new house?
- Yes.
We should have that
round, bubbling water tub...
Jacuzzi. Yes, Jacuzzi.
So many players in our town
are dying to go to Switzerland
and millions across the country.
There are only 11 such fools
who would not get distracted by a girl
because they aren't playing
to get a pool or a car.
They are scoring goals for India.
You're quite a serious kind of girl.
I'll score goals for India as well.
If I play for India...
you'll be mine, right?
Did you rehearse the song for me?
Yes.
Not really.
Couldn't spare time from hockey.
Sometimes I address her
As my guiding light
Sometimes I address her
As the love of my life
Sometimes I address her
As my guiding light
Sometimes I address her
As the love of my life
Lost in love, I barely survive
Don't leave me...
Sandeep scored 60 goals in three months.
And won eight
Man of the Tournament trophies.
For how long could Indian Hockey ignore
such a special player?
- Mom, is Bikram there?
- Sunny?
How are you?
- It's been so long--
- Is Bikram there?
Bikram's gone
to Mr. Sharma's with your dad.
Listen...
Silly boy! Hung up on me.
You're allowed only one call at a time.
You are talking to your senior.
Have some respect.
It's me, Sandeep. Is Brother Bikram there?
No, he's not here.
Okay.
Is someone knocking at your door?
Let me check.
- Hello.
- Hello.
It's for you.
- It's Sandeep.
- Sandeep?
- Yes.
- Give it to me.
Sandeep, you rascal! I've been
distributing my own wedding invites here.
Brother, I got selected for India.
I wanted you to be the first one to know.
I'm going on a tour to Poland.
If I make it to the finals,
I won't be able to attend the wedding.
That's not a problem.
Don't just reach the finals,
you must also win it!
Okay?
Many get selected to play for India,
but only a few last long enough.
Don't worry about anything.
We shall celebrate once you are back.
Okay?
Take care of yourself. Bye.
Sandeep has been selected
in the Indian Team.
Congratulations!
Well done!
What's with your attitude?
I'm a much senior player than you.
I'm a kabaddi player.
I got selected for India.
It's looking good on you,
the Indian jersey.
If you play well, you'll never lose it.
Go, nail them.
An amazing goal
in the first 15 minutes of the match!
Germany messes it up once again.
Temperament plays an important role
in a player's career.
Sandeep Singh
will have to keep that in mind.
Body tackle by Euan and Zgnacio
is an easy way to get
a player out through the yellow card.
Come on.
An amazing goal by Sandeep Singh.
Foul!
He's good at his game
but before you know it,
he'll pick on a fight.
You can't play like this!
- Yes!
- And with this goal,
Sandeep Singh becomes the second
highest goal scorer of the tournament.
Welcome to Six Nation Series Finals.
India versus Pakistan.
The match is not just between
these two countries
but is a contest between Tanveer Alam,
the highest goal scorer so far,
and India's Sandeep Singh,
the second highest goal scorer.
Bikram, I feel if Coach Harry had managed
to keep Sandeep Singh on the field
in all the matches for 70 minutes
it would have been a different story.
Or, he could've been out
of the tournament by now
if he got another yellow card.
He's changing positions.
Pass the ball!
Go... Move!
And a sloppy pass by Harmeet.
Oh, no, Sandeep Singh
just manages to dodge that.
It seems like Pakistan too is following
the same strategy as other teams.
Attacking Sandeep Singh.
- Come on.
- Sandeep.
You have to stick around
throughout 70 minutes.
Keep your cool.
Go for it, it's moving away.
Go...
Sandeep moved forward, dodging Tanveer.
Moving forward, he also manages
to dodge Ahmad Mushtaq.
- Sandeep!
- Oh, my god!
Sneaking in from behind,
a blow on the nose.
Sandeep! Move back! Doctor!
- Has he fainted? Must have hit him hard.
- Are you all right?
Tanveer will have to pay
the price for this.
Sandeep, good job.
It's a pity that both the highest
and the second highest goal scorers
are out of the game.
Losing a defender at this stage
could mean a huge loss to the team.
Pakistan will surely cash in
on this opportunity.
He has lost a lot of blood.
I doubt if Sandeep will be able
to make a comeback after this.
Pass...
Pass it to Tariq.
Good. Go for it.
Yusuf with the ball on center forward.
He's coming!
Goes straight to the goal! Fantastic goal!
Go.
And with that, we are at half time.
Just as I predicted, Pakistan is taking
advantage of India's weak defense.
India needs Sandeep Singh at this point.
- You are not going back.
- Sir...
I've been seeing hockey
for around 20 years now.
They'll break you if you go back there.
- This will be the end of your career.
- My career doesn't matter.
I'm not a legend.
This is my first tournament.
I am replaceable.
Now the second half begins.
Go... Good job.
- Ready?
- Yes.
- Lobo.
- Yes, take it.
Bikram! Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
- Rajinder!
- Sandeep Singh is back!
Best of luck.
We are already 20 minutes
into the second half.
Pass ahead.
Hit it, hit it back.
The center forward moves with the ball.
He manages to get to the "D",
Nitin cuts in
and India gets a short-corner.
India gets its first short-corner.
It seems like Sandeep Singh's entry
has changed the game.
Yusuf, cross the angle.
That's an amazing
backward pass to Harmeet.
And Harmeet's slap-shot
straight into the goal.
We're in trouble.
Like a true warrior!
- We didn't get him.
- Look!
Ninety seconds to go.
Pass the ball.
Go...
A 360 degree dodge by Sandeep!
It's a foul.
Fantastic partnership
between Sandeep and Nitin.
And there, India gets
its second short-corner!
He will again beat them.
If Sandeep scores another goal,
he'll become the highest goal scorer.
He will, for sure. He could also become
the player of the tournament.
Sandeep, we have to win the match.
Sandeep...
Sandeep...
Sandeep...
T hat's a fantastic goal!
A historic win for India
in the Six Nation Series Finals.
Look at the speedometer.
Sandeep has broken his own record.
His last drag flick was recorded
to be 108 kilometers per hour.
And this goal was drag flicked
at the speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
After this supersonic drag flick,
this new boy should be renamed as
Flicker Singh instead of Sandeep Singh.
Yes, Flicker Singh!
Our hockey king
Flicker Singh! Flicker Singh!
Our hockey king
Sandeep Singh.
My son, Zorawar.
He wants to be a hockey player like you.
- Great.
- Autograph, please.
Of course.
Here you go, dear.
God bless you.
Are you doing all right?
What happened to your nose?
Nothing much.
Listen.
They haven't printed much about you
in Punjabi newspapers.
Whatever little they have,
it's about some Flicker Singh.
You told us that you scored
most of the goals.
Yes, that's me. I am Flicker Singh.
- What?
- Look at this.
The media has given me a new name.
- "Flicker Singh scores maximum..."
- Sir.
Sir, you became the highest goal scorer
in your first international series.
- How does that feel?
- I feel good.
He feels good, very good.
I am also feeling very good.
I am his father. And he is my son.
Look at his photo in the newspaper.
He looks so handsome, doesn't he?
We live in a town called Shahbad.
And the camera...
Sorry, just a little to the...
So, we live in Shahabad, and he has been
playing hockey since his childhood.
And look at him,
he's made us so proud today.
When will this appear on TV?
On which channel will it be aired?
Are you happy now?
Very happy.
I am happier than Mogambo has ever been.
Okay, hold this.
I have some news for you too.
Take this.
Go on. Read it.
The letter arrived at home
soon after your selection.
You've got the job!
And here's my resignation.
Shahbad is here. Shahbad...
I've said my final goodbyes
to Yellow Printers.
Shahbad...
Shahbad...
- We've reached.
- Shahbad's here.
Get down. Stop the bus for us.
- Hop on. Come.
- You go ahead. I'll be back soon.
- Come home first.
- I'll be right back. See you.
Flicker Singh! Do you remember
the address to your new house?
Bani never scores a goal.
- She's a goalkeeper, Mom.
- Hello.
Hello, dear.
No matter where they make you stand,
you always score a goal.
Come on, Mom.
Preet.
Hello.
Ajit had asked me to see you only when
I earn a name for myself in hockey.
What's this? What should I do with this?
It's not for you.
Idiot, you got the job because
you are part of the team now.
Once you are out of the team,
you will be on my mercy.
He scored 16 goals, sir.
The Indian team doesn't have
a better drag flicker than him.
Chances of him
being dropped are slim, sir.
Zip it up. Just zip it up.
You played for India under my training.
- Don't you forget that.
- I played for India
without your training.
So, I'm sure others can manage too.
You too shouldn't forget that.
Do you want her to play for India,
or get married and stay at home?
No.
She will continue to play
even after our marriage...
if we have your support.
- Give me my hockey stick!
- Don't bother.
Last time, I didn't say a word
to save Preet from your beating
as I was your student then.
This time, you won't be the only one
using the hockey stick.
And let alone getting you snacks,
none will bother to get you water.
Get lost! Get back! Back on the ground.
Welcome, my brave lad.
The new star player of
the Indian hockey team will be greeted
to our new house by the new member
of our family, our daughter-in-law.
- Applause...
- Mr. Sandeep Singh

I have a trial in the morning.
I must leave.
What?
Well...
Nothing.
Say it.
I won't be able to stop if I start.
Say it.
No one will stop you.
I can hear you.
Really?
You've got a lifetime
to tell me whatever you want to.
Go, play the World Cup first.
I'll do my best.
- Don't see my matches.
- I won't.
I didn't see the Poland tournament
and you became the highest scorer.
You must win this one.
Once I am back from the World Cup,
we'll all go for a vacation to Shimla.
- Remember the last vacation?
- Did we ever go for one?
You were three years old
when dad took us all to Delhi.
We didn't have money,
we had to stay in the same room.
Sunny! You are late.
- All five of us in the same room?
- Yes.
You were fine, sleeping on the bed
with mom and dad.
I had to sleep on the floor with grandma.
We'll book 3 rooms when we go to Shimla.
Take this.
- Watch it! Be careful, man!
- Sorry.
It's okay. No worries.
- Hail Almighty.
- Hail Almighty.
Go.
What shall I get you?
Just win the gold.
Sandeep, you must have
a lot of girlfriends.
- Give me a girl's number.
- Sunny!
Let's go, Sunny.
Cheeku has got a seat for you there.
Let it be. I'm comfortable here.
Don't irritate me now.
Let's go and sit there.
- Come on.
- Okay, bye.
Okay.
Let's go.
- Come on.
- She's so cute.
- Here.
- Keep this.
- I wore it as a child.
- Fine.
This one, it's from our uncle.
- Don't bother...
- How much for this?
He's a miser. Let me check.
Your family is full of misers.
And your family is so generous, right?
Yes, comparatively.
Forget it. I know.
- Sunny?
- Yes.
I always take this seat
whenever I'm on a tour.
- Okay.
- It's lucky for me.
You even had a girlfriend named Lucky.
She left you, didn't she?
And he bought the tickets for her.
Sunny, come and sit here.
Let me settle the score.
- Sure.
- Just remain seated. Don't drag this.
- Remain seated.
- I don't care. Come and sit here.
- Okay. There you go.
- Your relatives didn't give us anything.
All of this was gifted by my family.
Yes, some old empty bottles
of supplements!
What the hell! You call this a gift?
- What can I say?
- You're very rich, aren't you?
- Did her father come? Let me check...
- Excuse me.
Yes?
- Did you board the train from Shahbad?
- Yes.
Why?
So, you got married in Shahbad.
- Good.
- What's your problem, man?
I am Sandeep Singh.
Team India's hockey player.
- How does that concern us?
- I too am from Shahbad.
Oh, is that you?
What do they call you these days
in the newspapers?
- Flicker Singh.
- Yes, Flicker Singh.
- Yes.
- I saw your picture.
You looked cute.
Neetu, come on this side.
- Come on, get up.
- Hey...
- Drop it.
- Fine.
Listen. What is it?
I am planning to get married soon.
- That's why I asked.
- Okay.
- Okay, why don't you give me an autograph!
- Okay.
- What are you doing, Neetu?
- Just a minute.
Where's the pen? Here it is.
Here you go.
- What is your name?
- Neetu.
- Neetu?
- Yes.
- Dear Neetu!
- Yes.
Don't forget to mention Balveer as well.
Of course,
Balveer will always be there
along with Neetu.
Okay. "Dear Neetu
- and Balveer."
- When are you getting married?
If I could, I would get married today.
In the train?
- Soon.
- Okay.
"Happy married life."
"Sandeep Singh."
- Sir...
- Sunny! What's wrong?
- Sunny!
- Sunny! What happened?
- Sunny...
- Sunny!
- Sunny...
- Sunny! What happened to you?
- Sunny?
- Sir?
I didn't shoot you on purpose.
- You didn't do it on purpose?
- I didn't know!
You didn't do it on purpose?
Cheeku! Cheeku!
- Sunny!
- Sir?
Sunny, get up. Sunny...
Cheeku! Go and stop the train.
I'll page them. You be with him.
I didn't realize
there was a bullet in the chamber.
- Sunny, what happened?
- Sir...
It's going to be okay.
Hold on, Sunny.
Sunny, you'll be fine. Hold on.
Cheeku, stop the train!
You will be fine. Don't worry.
Keep your eyes open, Sunny.
Keep them open.
Brother, if I don't go play,
I'll be out of the team.
And the job...
Sunny.
Call Preet.
Please call Preet.
I'll call her.
The doctors seem good.
Why isn't anyone telling us anything?
Who knows if Sunny will
ever come out of coma!
Why won't he?
Of course he will.
My child.
He'll be fine.
According to the current market rates,
you won't get more than this
for your house.
- It's your call now.
- We just bought it a month ago.
How can the rates change
so much in a month?
It's okay, Son. Let it go.
Take this.
Climb up.
Mr. Gurcharan, are you sure
you want to get back to your field job?
Mr. Joshi, when I had to walk endlessly
carrying this 30 kilogram heavy bag,
I never felt as tired...
as I feel now,
just sitting in the hospital.
I don't want to lose
this habit of walking.
Don't worry.
I'll manage.
How is Sandeep?
I'm fine.
I asked, how is Sandeep?
Sandeep...
Sandeep is still the same.
There is no change in his condition.
I wonder why God did this to him.
Are you leaving the tour midway?
Not only will the Federation
raise a question...
but I will make sure,
this is the end of your career.
I will face the Federation.
And as far as my career is concerned,
if I'm capable enough,
no one can stop me from playing.
Not even you.
An arrow piercing the heart...
What does that mean?
It means "I love you."
Thank you, Son.
"Preeti."
Since when did you become
so popular amongst the girls?
Sandeep has a lot of fans now.
"I have started playing hockey
because of you."
"I wish to become
a drag flicker like you one day."
Even kids are writing to you.
Look at this.
He's drawn a picture for you.
A hockey stick and a ball.
Dad, stop reading these letters.
Let him have his food first.
Come on.
Going over
to our sports correspondent, Suyash,
who's right outside PGI Chandigarh..
Suyash, is it true
that Sandeep Singh is out of coma?
Yes, Shalini, that is true.
After 15 days,
Sandeep is finally out of coma.
His condition is improving.
- This is good news.
- Why can't I turn it off?
It's a great news for the fans.
This means we'll soon see Sandeep Singh
back on the hockey field.
Shalini, though Sandeep
has come out of coma,
but the news is not good
for the hockey fans.
As per the doctors, Sandeep
has been paralyzed below the waist.
The hockey fans here
are terribly disheartened to know
that Sandeep Singh,
the star drag flicker of the Indian team,
will never be able to step
on a hockey field again.
Shalini, this brings us to an important
question coming to everyone's minds.
If Sandeep had received
medical treatment on time,
could we have saved him
from getting paralyzed?
This raises a question
If an Indian hockey player
doesn't get an ambulance
for six hours after being shot,
what can a common man expect?
We will keep getting live updates for you.
But until then, with great regret,
we have to say
that Sandeep Singh, the star player
of the Indian hockey team
won't be able to stand up
on his feet ever again.
- That was our correspondent...
- These media guys speak rubbish.
We'll see you after a short break.
Keep watching
your favorite channel, Y News.
- I was going to...
- Leave.
I was about to tell you.
All of you, please leave.
My child! God! What has happened!
Brother.
Bikram.
Bikram.
Bikram!
Sunny!
What happened?
- What's wrong?
- I've been calling out to you!
I had gone to get the medicines.
Why didn't you call the nurse?
You know that I feel shy.
I don't even let dad in.
And you still left me alone.
It's my fault.
I'll never leave you alone.
Okay?
Come on now, lie on your side.
A little more.
Move this hand. Be careful.
Good job.
A little more.
You are my brave brother.
What is it?
Nothing much has happened.
That's it.
Careful there.
Sandeep.
We can't make it to Switzerland now.
Never mind.
We can go to Shimla instead.
With you by my side,
Shimla will be as good as Switzerland.
Doctors think there is a possibility
that you could get back on your feet.
A very slim chance.
And hockey is out of the question.
It's okay.
I played hockey only for you.
If I'm destined to this, so be it.
As long as you are with me.
What are you saying? You're a sportsman.
How can you be happy in a wheelchair?
I thought I was going to meet
an Indian hockey player...
who must be perhaps... shattered to know
that he will never be able to play again.
But I met just another boy
who forgot everything about that.
He was just happy to see me,
his Preet, by his side.
Let's go.
- You're sure you want to go?
- Yes, Mom. I am sure.
I don't mind pushing a wheelchair
for the rest of my life.
I will do it happily
if Sandeep is on that wheelchair.
But I'd be happier to see him
standing on his own two feet.
Even if he does so without me.
Are you sure he'll get back on his feet
if you are not here with him?
No, I'm not...
but I'm sure, he'll never
get back on his feet if I am with him.
You know, all that he did so far
was all for me.
Be it hockey, getting a job,
or getting beaten up by the coach.
Now if he gets me...
He won't even bother to try
and get back on his feet.
Okay. Final call.
- My child!
- Come.
I've been asking you since long.
Where's Preet?
She just came to meet me once
and then disappeared.
You didn't find out?
How do I find out?
I spend the nights here with you,
and go to work during the day.
I hope she is okay.
We're going back home anyway.
I'll find out once you settle at home.
Okay, mister?
Come on, my boy. Let's go.
Come on.
Good.
My brave lad is back.
- Thank you.
- Welcome home.
Let's go.
Thank You, God.
Let's go, Mom.
You can do the crying part inside.
- Come, Son.
- I'm kidding.
Come, Son. Come inside.
Let's go, Son.
- Let's go inside.
- Come on.
Here we go.
Come on, everyone.
- Come.
- Wait.
Let me set the mood right.
Mr. Sandeep Singh
The new shining star of Indian hockey
The talk of the town is back
Welcome home
Welcome
Welcome
Welcome
Welcome...
Gurcharan, come on, dance along.
Come on. You can do better.
There you go!
Join us, Son.
He rides a lion...
Continue, Uncle.
Come on now!
Let's have a bet, there's no backing out
He flirts with beauties
It's a pleasure to know him
He is my life, my buddy
Can give up the world for him, my brother
Good man

Answer the phone, Preet.
You didn't want to come to the hospital.
I can understand.
Are you going to leave me alone
in this state?
Is this my fault?
What have I done wrong?
I want to hear your voice.
I'll keep calling, Preet.
I will, until you answer the phone.
Until you talk to me.
Until you laugh when I sing.
I'll keep calling until you come back.
Preet.
Do you want me to beg of you?
Is that what you want?
Get this straight.
When god stops answering prayers,
people stop believing in him.
I feel so embarrassed now.
When I was at my worst, I told you things
which I was scared to tell my own self.
I feel disgusted.
Don't you dare
come in front of me ever again.
Sunny!
Come on.
Hold on to me, come on.
What were you doing?
What do you want?
How many times did I ask you
to go find out where Preet is!
You are just busy doing your work.
What?
My work?
Cleaning your shit is my work?
Why do it and mention?
If that's what I intended to do,
I could've listed many more things.
And everyone here could have done so.
Should I thank all of you for it?
No one needs your acknowledgement.
I am working at two places
to run the house.
- Dad has resumed his field job.
- No, Bikram.
Wait! He barely escaped
being run over by a train!
Did you even realize that
we have come back to our old house?
Yes, mom sold the new house
to pay off the expenses
for your treatment.
Look around you, mister!
He wants to thank us for all of that.
Don't do it if it is such a trouble!
Leave me!
- Come on.
- No.
- Let me take you there.
- No. Bikram...
- I'll take you to her house.
- No.
She came to the hospital,
saw you in that state and ran away.
Her house is locked.
Stop it!
Son...
Mom.
I'll see to it
that he doesn't go unpunished.
He shot at my child.
My brave lad.
Don't you worry.
I'll make sure
he rots in prison all his life.
I'll do anything I have to,
but I won't spare him.
If you really want to do something for me,
help me get back on my feet.
Here's your resignation letter.
Haven't put a date yet.
I want to help Bikram.
I want to put a date
on your resignation letter.
I want to get back on my feet.
I have already spoken
to the Chairman and Mr. Harry.
My child has grown up into a man.
Well done, my boy.
Well done.
There... our famous captain,
Mr. Dhyan Chand.
Today is your last day.
Sharma will be replacing you tomorrow.
Rehabilitation in Holland
will cost us around 35 lakhs.
Mr. Chairman, we are talking
about hockey here, not cricket.
A player is a player, sir.
Be it a cricket player
or a hockey player...
we'll have to take a chance.
Yes.
You will take your chance and retire.
It is I who will be questioned.
Sir, we are giving him a pension.
And there are millions working,
sitting on a wheelchair.
These millions
don't play for India, Sharma.
Kids play cricket
in every street of this country
with a dream that if they play for India,
then their lives will be made.
I agree that we aren't the Cricket Board.
But if we want hockey to reach
the same point where it was...
then we will have to
look after our players.
We will have to respect them.
Okay.
Both of you wait outside for some time.
- Okay, sir.
- Okay, sir.
Preeto.
Why are you taking it so personally,
Mr. Chairman?
You should just retire
and leave all of this to me.
Why spend so much on a handicapped player?
That too from my budget?
Once I am done with you,
nothing can fix you.
Sir, it's from the minister.
It isn't a favor.
It is my duty.
The hospital...
It's okay.
I am scared, sir.
Everyone is trying their best and...
if I don't get back on my feet...
Are you looking for a compliment?
I have seen many players.
You are a good one.
This is my India jersey.
I want it back soon.
He got the sanction for rehab
in just one day.
But the year that followed
was quite difficult for both of us.
Both of us were in a foreign land.
We had company and yet we were lonely.
To live without you is deceitful
To live without you is difficult
Memories haunt me
Heartache taunts me
How do I convince myself?
Oh, stranger
Oh, stranger
Oh, stranger
Oh, stranger
Oh, stranger
What I tried to snatch away from life
Could never be with me
From a distance
There is no regret, I believe
Leave me alone with my solitude
Don't let my anger cause any harm to you
To live without you is deceitful
Without you
To live without you is deceitful
Without you
Without you, how do I convince my life?
Oh, stranger
Oh, stranger
Lord, give me the strength
I am no devotee, give me devotion
Waheguru, Allah, you have many names
Waheguru, Allah, you have many names
The wealth of your love, let me claim
To live without you is deceitful
To live without you is difficult
Memories haunt me
Heartache taunts me
How do I convince myself?
Oh, stranger
Oh, stranger
Oh, stranger
Oh, stranger
Oh, stranger
Oh, stranger
Oh, stranger
Oh, stranger
Brother, the flight from Holland
will land at eight.
This idiot has brought us here at six!
Let it be, Gurcharan.
He is eager to meet Sunny.
Am I right, Bikram?
If he is that eager,
then he should've come at four instead.
Where are those musicians?
I told you not to pay them in advance.
No one listens to me.
- You have called them, right?
- Of course, I did.
I had called them.
Then why didn't they show up?
Make sure the flag hoists high
My body is my country, I cry
This is what keeps me alive
Don't stop at the shore
Keep swimming, stay afloat
The currents will lead you, I am sure
My child!
Oh, God!
My child!
Thank you, God.
Oh, God!
Cleaning your shit is my work?
Why do it and mention?
If I had to do that,
I could've listed many more things.
Should I thank all of you for it?
Sandeep.
Sit down.
Sit.
I am your elder brother.
I know why you are here.
You need my help, right?
Hold my feet and apologize.
Go on, apologize.
I want to play for India.
Please help me.
Do you really want to play for India,
or is it for that girl?
I am not that selfish.
I became a player for her,
but I went to rehab for my family.
And now, I want to play for India,
for our country.
Move.
There is an Indian Airways tournament.
But there is a problem.
What?
It is against my team.
Are you scared to play against me?
Idiot! It took you six months
to apologize.
I'll see you while I train you.
And I'll take my revenge on the field.
Okay?
Okay.
- Let's go.
- Smile.
Let's go, then?
For a run?
Lucky scoundrel managed
to get back on his feet.
Behind me lurks darkness
Ahead lies a storm
In this storm, I want a lamp to survive
Let's go.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, boys.
Either the heart will turn into stone
Or the heart of stone will beat
I have taken up a challenge to feel alive
Forget...
Sunny, body play.
Use distraction to get the ball.
Go get it.
Forget, the night long gone
Start afresh this morning
Yes. Up. Left.
From ground to sky, oh, my brother
Look up, soar high
From ground to sky, oh, my brother...
Get it!
They stick to their guns
These brave warriors
Handsome and charming
Our brave warriors
They stick to their guns
These brave warriors
Handsome and charming
Our brave warriors
Faced death Battled storms...
Again.
Survived, I have
To the beckon of life
To make a better life
Survived, I have
Defamed I was, to build a new name
I had started something
To take it to the end
Embrace me, life
Look up, soar high
From ground to sky, oh, my brother...
Go...
Look up, soar high,
From ground to sky, oh, my brother
Oh, my brother
They stick to their guns
These brave warriors
Handsome and charming
Our brave warriors
They stick to their guns...
- Brother...
- Idiot! Hug me.
Good job.
Pass the ball.
- Push it.
- Well done.
Call the goalie.
Yoginder, come here.
Good job.
Straight!
Partner, Sandeep.
I have your jersey safe with me.
Just waiting to put it on.
Ready for a drag flick?
One year of your chairmanship
and I get called back!
What's going on?
Sir, you asked me to make a file of
the mistakes made by our team, so...
The biggest mistake
was that goals weren't scored.
Sir, Sandeep is back.
We could consider him
for the Commonwealth Championship.
He will surely be considered
but you won't be.
Harry.
You will form the team.
Victory to India!
Forget, the night long gone
Start afresh this morning
Look up, soar high
From ground to sky, oh, my brother
Look up, soar high
From ground to sky, oh, my brother
Oh, my brother
They stick to their guns
These brave warriors
Handsome and charming
Our brave warriors
They stick to their guns
These brave warriors
Handsome and charming
Our brave warriors
Federation has sent tickets
for the England match.
Did you hear uncle's plan?
He's putting up a big screen
on the hockey field.
He has invited the entire neighborhood.
There will be drums, a DJ and the works.
Can I get three tickets?
No.
All of them are yours. You can keep them.
Who do you wish to give them to?
I didn't want to invite them
without informing you.
We've been through a lot to get here.
Just be careful.
You have a match next week.
I was so happy to hear
that Sandeep was not only fine
but was also back on his feet,
running and playing hockey as well.
International hockey doesn't give
a second chance to any player.
Sandeep had grabbed this chance,
and everyone was going to
witness the outcome in the next match.
The match that was going to
take place in my new city, London.
You look just the same.
How?
The way you did when we last met.
I'm glad you don't look the same.
I wanted to ask you something.
How's hockey going for you?
I thought you'd ask something else.
I started playing hockey for you.
I had no other goal in life then
other than you.
Then you went away.
To be honest, I cursed you then...
but I am here now because of you.
I called you here to thank you.
You will come for tomorrow's match?
I might.
This is what I was hoping to hear.
I'll wait for you.
Tanveer won't witness his defeat
sitting out.
He will see it on the field.
Tanveer, you have to break Sandeep.
Even if we let them score 12 goals,
the 13th will be ours, sir.
Thirteen is an evil number,
and I'm in the mood to kill today.
Go, get them!
Sandeep returns to international hockey
as a captain after a serious injury.
I hope this doesn't prove to be another
mistake of the selection committee.
There's Sandeep.
There comes the king of Shahbad,
Sandeep Singh!
A round of applause.
There's my brave lad.
And with that, the first half begins.
Pakistan gets possession,
Yusuf passes the ball to Tanveer.
Stop it.
- Go...
- Good...
And he targets his waist.
Sandeep, get out of there.
Tanveer does an east-west dribble,
moves forward and a powerful strike.
Pakistan scores its first goal
within the first ten minutes of the game.
Keep the tempo high, guys.
It's just one goal.
Sandeep and his team
will have to come up with a new strategy.
Sandeep.
Go...
Good job.
- Well done!
- Good going!
Get it.
Mind your foot.
And a clever move to turn
a simple pass into a short-corner.
You can see the determination
on Sandeep's face.
And that's a fantastic goal!
A true warrior indeed.
India one, Pakistan two.
- It's one-on-one. Careful.
- Go for the shot.
Pakistan gets another opportunity
for a short-corner.
- Go...
- Come on, Sunny.
The atmosphere is tense.
Tanveer Alam challenging
that he'll hit at the right corner.
Go...
And that's a powerful strike.
Tanveer Alam stuck to his promise
adding up to India's worries.
Don't mess with us.
It's bitter...
but it's true, Mr. Chairman.
Preeto, aren't you going for the match?
Pakistan's attack
is at its peak at the finals.
Long live Pakistan!
Come on.
Sandeep Singh plays aggressive hockey.
Sandeep passes,
and Raghuveer scores a goal!
My child is back in his form.
No one can stop him now.
You saw that?
Amazing!
He is over-acting. He's pretending.
I'll come there and beat you up.
Shut up.
Let's see whether Sandeep Singh can
convert this short-corner into a goal.
That was an amazing 360-degree
dodge by Sandeep Singh!
- Yes!
- That was an awesome goal.
Five minutes left on the ticker.
And Sandeep Singh scoring this goal
at the eleventh hour is amazing.
Well played!
Both the teams have the same score.
Keep your ego aside
and clap for him, Sharma.
That boy is playing for India.
Strike a goal, Tanveer.
He dodges the goalkeeper
and tries to score a goal.
That's a great sliding defense by Sandeep.
Pass it.
Gagan!
Navjyot, come on.
Wait...
Well done Sandeep Singh.
Instead of the mid-fielder,
he chose the center forward
and earned a critical
short-corner for India.
You're coming for tomorrow's match?
I'll wait for you.
Sandeep...
This is a great opportunity
for Sandeep Singh
to prove himself as a player,
a drag flicker and as a captain.
Sandeep, we have to
convert this one in a goal.
Sandeep, you must make India win.
We must take the cup with us.
Sandeep...
- Don't see my matches.
- I won't.
Oh, no, he slips
and missed the target.
Losing your body balance
at such an important moment...
losing your focus could be dangerous.
We'll soon find out.
The Indian team is celebrating
whereas Pakistan's team
has applied for a review.
India and Pakistan.
Both the countries are
waiting for the result with bated breaths.
Don't worry, the ball went out.
We have won.
I think Sandeep Singh missed the target.
It felt like someone fired a bullet.
That was a fantastic strike,
tearing the net apart!
That's a historic win for India.
Sandeep Singh creates
a record with this goal.
Forget, the night long gone
That was an awesome flick, Brother!
You tore the net. Well done!
Look up, soar high
From ground to sky, oh, my brother
Look up, soar high...
That goal made me realize
that it wasn't scored by my Sandeep.
It was scored by India's Sandeep Singh.
Sandeep Singh, who doesn't
get distracted by anyone anymore.
Sandeep Singh, who will take
Indian hockey to new heights.
Sandeep Singh,
world's fastest drag flicker.
And Indian hockey's highest goal scorer.
Mr. Sandeep Singh is one of India's
greatest hockey players.
As a member of the Indian team,
he won gold
at Sultan Azlan Shah
International Hockey Tournament, 2009,
and at Four Nations International
Hockey Tournament, 2008.
He captained the hockey team
at Asia Cup, 2009
and has been the highest goal scorer
at many international tournaments.
Recognizing his outstanding achievements
in the field of hockey,
Mr. Sandeep Singh is being awarded
with the Arjuna Award, 2010.
Mr. Sandeep Singh.
