Wake up
Wake up
Lazy bones..Wake up
It's Christmas Eve.
Temperatures are hgher by 2-3 deg°C
Affected by high atmospheric pressure.
It will be sunny throughout the country.
It's hard to look forward
to a white Christmas.
The weather today..
High Wind warning..
She says no snow.
Hana
You believe her or your father?
Of course..
I believe her.
You bluff me for 3 years saying
there's Santa Claus.
Kids your age got deceived
even dad got deceived too..
Err..
Drop by my work place after
school and you'll know
if it snow or your dad is lying to you
Grandma says, you are not married 
so we are rather incomplete.
Uh..
I am concern you don't 
sleep well in the night.
I see you sleeping soundly snoring away.
Hana dear
Believe your father.
Christmas this year
will be the most wonderful.
Really?
Sure..
Last year's Christmas party
was really grand.
Yes..Ballet on ice.
Because of that party
price of his Tower's apartments soared.
Understanding the market is not easy.
Thanks to you, we made a bundle.
I believe pricing trends of real
estate needs changes.
Schools and businesses usually
determined market price.
Additional services are needed
to influence pricing.
What the plan like for this year?
If I say it now, will it
be a surprise then?
Ha ha ha ha
You can tell us secretly..
Tower Sky welcomes your residency.

Lee Sun-Woo
terrifying.
This is the reality we have to face.
Is there no way to prevent this?
Looking at it.
We can only minimize the tragedy,
by blowing down the building.
Yes right. I understood
Pull out the firefighters.
Prepare for detonation.
There are still many inside
to be rescued.
You want Yeouido down with them?
How much time is there?
The whole building has begun falling.
Has lost its balance
So it is difficult to predict.
Especially the high floors. It's
beginning to tilt.
85th floor's water tank weight
is acting on it.
Tilted to a side, the fall of the
building will speed up
How much of water in those tanks?
Approximately 800 tons.
If we release the water
will it slow down the collapse?
If the weight on the building is reduce.
It does delay the time.
Let's get started.
It won't work.
Firefighters can't get in.
It is a vital part of building
only few have access to it.
Young-Ki, it's an emergency situation.
The building about to collapse.
To get out of here alive
There is only 10 minutes to release
water from the tanks.
For this
Mr. Lee. We need
your fingerprint access.
This is too cruel...
He was in great pain now.
In this building.
There are many children like Hana.
The sentiments of those parents
are just like yours.
There is no time left.
If we do not act fast.
There will be many more
like you, heartbroken
as parents
Mr. Lee Dae-hao
I need you now.
