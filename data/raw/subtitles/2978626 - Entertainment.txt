Hello and welcome to the TC Show.
No, we are not talking
about Railway TC's here.
This is 'TC', Tele-Shopping Channel.
I would like to show an AV..
..to our heavy audience.
And don't mistake
him for anyone ordinary.
..he's quite a heavy personality.
Our very own Mumbai
boy Akhil Lokhande.
I was quite disturbed.
I always wanted to
excel in even field.
But these days..
...I'm living my life in
4 XL, 5 XL, 6 XL sizes.
I always wanted to do
work equal of six people.
Now when I enter any lift..
...I realize I am
equivalent to six people.
I always thought life could
never tread on a single wheel.
When there is a will,
there is no way.
I always thought how
will I pacify my kid.
I am really disturbed.
Friends, this depressing
AV was shot two months ago.
Well, let's welcome..
Farhad, Sajid, is the stage firm?
Yes, absolutely.
Please welcome Akhil Lokhande.
Akhil Lokhande. Wow!
Yöu showed up alone.
I don't see the rest
of Akhil Lokhande's anywhere.
Sir, now no more "I'm disturbed".
But I am surprised.
How did this happen?
Hold on.
JO!
Jagtap Capsules!
A unique invention
made of Ayun/edic herbs.
A bottle of JC...and yöu're all set.
JO means...
- Jagtap Capsules.
Come on.
Turn this Laurel into Hardy.
- Yes, sir.
And he should look
like Akhil Lokhande.
Sir..
- Stick it properly.
Yöu're not concentrating.
- Sir.
The deal was 4000,
this is just 2500.
So, yöu didn't put on
any weight for it either.
Keep this, a bottle of JC.
Go and build 16 abs.
World record.
Be happy.
Yöu've got yöur head in the air.
I will kill yöu.
Why? Are yöu a villain?
Villain?
Don't create a scene here.
- Why, are yöu a jester?
Jester.
Don't test me, my hands are not tied.
- Why? Are yöu a widow?
Widow?
Why yöu..
Phone's ringing.
Hold him.
Hello.
Yes, I am coming.
I said I am coming.
If I wasn't in such a hurry..
...I would've exacted my money.
Get lost.
- It's important,
or I wouldn't have spared yöu.
He pretends as if the entire
world dances to his tune.
One more.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop the rehearsals.
Music cut. Music cut.
Remove all the male dancers..
..keep the female dancers.
Boys, pack-up.
Girls, come in the front.
What do yöu mean by
"Girls come in the front" Remo sir?
Yöu think yöu can throw
us out whenever yöu like?
I know, I'll break yöur teeth?
Why, are yöu a dentist?
Dentist?
I'll crush yöu.
- Why, are yöu tobacco?
Tobacco?
I'll will gut yöu.
- Why, are yöu Hajmola?
Hajmola, why yöu..
Let go.
Let me go.
Hold him.
Hello? Coming.
Let me go.
- If l didn't have to leave urgently.
...I would've exacted my money.
Understand.
Get lost.
It's important
or I wouldn't have spared yöu.
Let go.
Let go.
Important?
He pretends as
if he'll build a big empire.
Lord...
So Borivali team has set a target.
..of 120 runs for Dombivali's team.
And Dombivali team's opening batsman.
..has arrived on the crease.
One.. Two.
Howzat!
What?
Where did yöu get him from?
It touched my bat.
He'll even give a cripple LBW out.
Now go.
- Sir, it hit the bat.
Be quiet,
or I'll give yöu out as well.
Howzat!
Howzat!
Howzat!
Howzat!
Howzat!
Howzat!
Howzat!
Here's yöur money.
Akhil, yöu really
stirred up things today.
Really!
What can I do?
I have to get to my other job..
But this is not done.
Yöur days of raising
fingers are over, boy.
Now I will lift my hand.
- Why? Are yöu a beggar?
I will send yöu back on a stretcher?
Why? Are yöu a compounder?
I am going to malign yöu.
Why? Are yöu a rag-picker?
- Rag..
Let's take care of him!
Now say. Come on.
Here. Keep one note.
Hey...
- Hey!
Don't hit.
- Let's go.
Now get to yöur other job.
Other work.
Feels like yöu've married to
yöur work, not me.
Each day I would kindle my desires..
..on the threshold of hopes.
And today's ‘Kanlachauth’.
The biggest day in yöur wife's life.
Most important.
And yöu came late even today.
Why?
Yöu made me yöur wife.
So why did yöu do this with me?
Why?
Parvati , actually...
...work is just an excuse.
There's someone else in my life.
Kavyanjali.
Dear, please try to..
- Enough!
Enough! Enough!
"Virtuous bonds",
Made for Each Other"..
...all these are just
too good to be true.
But the truth is...
I am just yöur discard.
All I wanted was one smile of joy".
..in my own beautiful world of dreams.
But yöu've proved..
..our union is no Iongerjustified.
Cut it. Very good shot.
Bunch of freeloaders.
Hi.
Our date was fixed before my shoot.
And I am sorry.
What are yöu doing?
Well, I feel like taking
yöu to an expensive place today.
Where?
Petrol Station.
Because there's nothing
more expensive than that.
Uncle, ball.
Thank yöu.
Yöu know,
my life's like this football.
Whoever comes,
kicks me and gets ahead.
Yöu'll achieve yöur goal
through these kicks, Akhil.
And I know what yöur goal is.
To help yöur father get better.
Poor guy's been in
the hospital for a year.
Yöu work day and night
to cover his expenses.
But just watch.
Someday he'll be absolutely fine.
Really?
I swear.
Thanks.
Hey.
Forget it. Thief.
Are yöu hitting on me?
Do I look like a ruler to hit on yöu.
Will yöu stick to me?
- Do I look like Fevicol to stick to yöu?
Kiss me?
- Am I Emraan Hashmi to kiss yöu?

So...what do yöu want to say?
Have yöu planned for
a candle light Dinner?
Papa's trying to save electricity.
Quiet.
For yöur kind information.
I like my conversation.
..in the isolation of darkness.
Miser!
What happened?
There's no arm-rest on this side.
Yöu get only half the
sofa in half the amount.
Hey!
What are yöu doing?
Papa, let me switch on one light.
Sir, I'm here to ask for
yöur daughter's hand for marriage.
And do yöu have
irritation or objection..
..with the rest of her body?
Meaning?
I mean..
..yöur relation with my
daughter is out of question.
Cancellation, rejection!
Why, sir?
What lacks in me?
Yöu've something even
the rich can't have.
- What?
Poverty.
Yöu're poor.
- Sir, yöur..
Yöu're a hapless.
There's no strength
in this relationship.
Papa!
Yöur daughter's necessities are few..
..that's why this
relationship is the best.
What do I want?
Three cotton clothes,
two pieces of bread..
...and a single courtyard.
I don't want a palace of sorrows..
..just a hut filled with joy.
Get lost.
Stop reciting yöur TV serial dialogues.
Hey...
What's yöur name?
Yeah Akhil Lokhande.
Lokhande!
Listen carefully.
I want a husband for my daughter...
..who's wealthy, and not the person
who wants sympathy.
Wealthy.
Now do yöu understand?
Come back when yöu're rich.
Out!
Out!
What if I don't go?
I'll kick yöu?
- Why, are yöu a donkey?
I'll break yöur milk-teeth?
- Why, are yöu the milkman?
I'll bash yöu so hard.
- Why, are yöu a maid?
He's so audacious.
Fine, if yöu like
being such a loud-mouth..
..then...swear on this fire..
Yöu won't decide
to marry my daughter..
..until yöu
become a millionaire.
Come on, swear.
Akhil..
- Don't say anything.
I swear.
First millionaire,
then Sakshi's husband.
Papa's trying to trap yöu.
Yöu are trapped.
Laugh all yöu want, sir.
But listen to my
mathematics carefully.
I am going to multiply money..
..and soon it will subtract
the smile on yöur face.
Yöur mind will get divided..
..and yöur daughter
will get added in my life.
Are yöu a mathematics teacher?
Addition.
Papa, electricity's back.
I am ruined.
Who's going to pay the bill?
I am ruined.
I am ruined.
I will kill yöu.
Who will pay my bills?
O Bollywood...who do I pray to..
..so that business is never slow..
..and my shop makes me popular.
Jugnu, give me 'Honeymoon Dvd".
Son, first take ‘Dosti’,
then ‘Mohabbatein’.
Then 'Shaadi No.1'
and then 'Honeymoon'.
And then..
That's 400 for 4 CDs.
Get out.
What do yöu want?
- 'Darr'.
Only 'Darr'.
- Yes.
Take Jeet as well.
- Why?
Because beyond 'Darr'
there's ‘Jeet’ (Victonj).
Show off..
Akhil.
Akhil.
My friend,
where are yöu going in such a hurry?
On my way to the hospital.
And after that to work.
I must admit, buddy.
Hold on.
Look, this is 'Baghbaan'.
Four sons couldn't look
after their only father.
And yöu alone do four
jobs a day for yöur father.
That's not a big thing.
I'm sweating for my own blood.
That's called love.
Yöu've always fulfilled
every desire of yöur father.
I'll come with yöu
to the hospital now.
And how would uncle be living".
..in the hospital all these clays?

Akhil?
Oh, God. I am exhausted.
Don't yöu have chest-pain anymore?
What chest-pain?
It's just another excuse.
..to spend another year
in this luxurious hospital.
And to get acquainted
to nurses like yöu.
But...is it a good thing
to squander yöur son's money?
It's bad. It's very bad.
But he's not my son.
He's my ticket to comfort and luxury.
He's my walking ATM counter for me.
Who's this?
Where are yöu going?
Son, yöu've arrived.
Am I a fax, to arrive?
Look, yöu're turning red.
Am I a traffic light to turn red?
Look, son, yöu're over-doing it.
Am I a bowler to do an over?
I treated yöu like God.
Tell me who my father is.
I've no clue.
But 30 years ago..
...I met yöur mother
during a rail journey.
Yöu were just a 3-4 years old kid.
Yöu were playing
in yöur mother's arms.
And during our conversation.
"Yöur mother narrated
her sad story to me.
How yöur father made
yöur mother pregnant.
..but not his wife, because..
..there was another
mistress in his life.
When yöur mother heard this..
..she left yöur conniving father..
..and was returning in that train.
But just then...
...the train met with accident.
And yöur mother passed away.
But yöu survived .
It's the grace of God, Akhil.
Yöu survived.
If I hadn't survived that day,
would I be..
I've yet to get to the point.
The interesting pan comes now.
The Rail Minister arrived
at the accident spot.
And he announced that.
..any family with
even on deceased member..
...will get 1 lakh as compensation.
Sol picked up his trunk, and him..
..and pretended as he was my son and..
Beat him.
- I am dead!
Beat him.
- Oh, God!
More.
Old man..
Yöu really gave him a sound beating.
Very good.
Old man.
As yöu sow...so shall yöu reap.
I can't believe this.
Yöur bachelor father's
shown us such a dirty picture.
The question is Akhil,
what is yöur existence.
Because this is reality.
Real life.
This isn't 'Golmaal' where
yöu'll find an old trunk..
..in the house like Ajay Devgan did.
Well, let's imagine
that yöu do find a trunk.
Yöu do.
But it's not necessary
that yöu'll open it up..
...and just like in Manisha's
film 'Love Letter'..
..it would have yöur
mother's love letters.
..and yöu'll find those too.
Well, we're filmy people.
Let's take some Iibeﬂy.
Let's assume that yöu
found the love letters as well.
It's not necessary that
yöu'll also find a locket.
...like Jeetendra did
in this film 'Locket'.
Since I took Jeetendra's name,
let's take some more liberty.
Even if yöu find the locket.
Yöu won't find yöur parent's
photo in the locket.
Even if yöu find
yöur father's picture..
..yöur father won't turn
out to be a millionaire.
Pannalal Johri.
Yes, Pannalal Johri.
Bangkok's diamond king.
He can't be yöur father.
My father's Pannalal Johri.
What?
- Yes.
What?
- Yes.
Akhil, yöu're a millionaire.
Jugnu.
I am a millionaire.
- Yes.
Jugnu. I am a millionaire.
What did I just press?
- What's this?
Bangkok's diamond merchant.
...multi-millionaire Pannalal Johri
passed away today.
Pannalal Johri was a renowned
personality in Bangkok.
Akhil.
Akhil.
Yöur father wasn't even born yet..
..and he Died.
Yöu're so unlucky.
Yöu're doomed.
Akhil.
Akhil.
Akhil.
Akhil.
I'll get water for yöu.
I hope my friend doesn't die.
Akhil.
Akhil, the shock's made yöu mad.
Jugnu, it's not the shock,
I am mad with joy.
Yöu heard the bad news,
not the complete news.
Listen. Listen.
So what about his property
worth 3000 crores.
Because he has no heir,
or wife and kids.
If any of his relative turns up..
..then he'll be the owner
of 3000 crores overnight.
Now yöu drink the water.
Some more.
Jugnu, my father's dead..
..and I am not happy about it.
In fact, I am very happy.
Why?
Because he betrayed my mother.
That's why Lord took away my father..
...and served me justice.
He gave me all these evidence..
..so that I can prove to the world..
..that I am Pannalal Johri's son.
Jugnu, now this
Slumdog's a millionaire.

WOW, Akhil.
From "l am really troubled"
to "l am really rich".
Crazy boy.
He's trying to stop the king..
..from entering his own palace.
Papa.
Papa, it's yöur son..
This is terrible.
I've been orphaned again.
What's this guy blabbering about?
Please.
Yöu look like an Indian.
- I am Habibullah Sheikh.
Pannalal's right-hand.
His lawyer.
Mister, how did this happen?
The diamond from Johri sir's
ring fell in his potato wedges.
And he swallowed the diamond instead.
And...he died in 2 minutes.
He's not a noodles to die instantly.
Address him with respect.
Do yöu know who he was?
He was my father.
He's my papa.
My dad.
Now give me the money.
Hanky.
What did yöu hear?
Money.
Corrupt mind!
Papa, yöu can't speak properly.
This man can't hear properly.
Life without yöu is no fun.
Because I've turned into an orphan.
Yöur memories are still
in this bungalow, isn't it?
So...now I will live in this bungalow.
..with yöur memories.
The car yöu took to the office,
that huge car..
..now I'll drive to the office in it.
I'll find yöur company
while handling yöur company papa.
What is it?
I would like to talk
to yöu on an important issue.
What?
- Talk.
Talk?
Akhil, I don't need to investigate.
I mean question yöu.
What?
Why can't yöu be Pannalal Johri's son?
Have some tea.
Every year,
when India can produce children..
"Equivalent to
population of Australia..
..then why can't
Pannalal sir produce yöu?
Is that logic enough for yöu?
- Yes.
He's from Bangkok, I'm from Borivali.
Is that okay?
I've another logic for that.
- Go ahead.
If India's Sania Mirza,
Pakistan's Shoaib Malik..
..can be husband and wife.
Then why can't Bangkok's
Pannalal Johri and..
Hold on. Have yöu studied LAW?
Yes?
No, because...this concerns 3000 crores,
Lulla sir.
Hey! That's Habibullah.
Look, my father's given me this name..
..with great love and affection.
So please..
- I mean, yöu're a lawyer.
Won't yöu ask for any evidence?
Like these...love-letters
written by my father.
This locket.
Family album.
But these days any
fraud can forge all this..
..with the help of computer graphics.
So here's my blood.
This will prove that I am his blood.
D.N.A.
'Daddy's Najayaz Aulad'
(Daddy's illegitimate son).
These things aren't needed, son.
I recognized yöu at first sight.
Yöur mother's name
was Shanti Devi, right?
Yes.
Sometimes,
my boss would feel embarrassed..
..and mention about her to me.
Fine.
So tell me,
Habibullah sir, when can I take over.
Yöu can't take over..
..because someone's
already over-taken yöu.
What do yöu mean?
Pannalal made a Will before he died.
And he transferred his
entire property to someone else.
Who is it?
Does he have another illegitimate son?
Any son?
More than a son?
This is a conspiracy.
A big game-plan.
Hold on.
Did he show yöu any proof?
Letter. . .locket. . father's picture.
Did the DNA matched?
Then damn it.
How can he be my father's heir?
How dare he try to assert
his right on my property?
No!
I won't let this happen.
Who's that rascal?
Where's that rascal?
Rascal!
Pannalal Johri's was
cremated only a while ago..
..and yöu've already usurped his seat.
It's about 3000 crores.
Everyone's conscience is for sale.
But I am the real heir
of Pannalal Johri, not yöu.
All this belongs to me.
This property is only mine.
Did yöu hear?
Turn the chair around.
Look at me.
Look into my eyes.
Turn the chair around!
He's Pannalal Johri's heir.
His sweet, adorable and only...
..and more than a son.
But he's a dog.
For God's sake, don't call him a dog.
- Why?
Because his name's Entertainment.
Why E nteﬂainment?
Why? Why not?
If pigeons can be called 'Masakali'.
Horse can be called 'Badal' (Cloud).
If Mahila Jaywardhane
can be a male's name.
Then why can't his
name be Entertainment?
Look, Akhil.
Pannalal Johri was really sad..
..after yöur mother's accident.
He started repenting .
He was living like a live monument.
For years he attempted
to find yöu two..
..in many continents.
But then he got disappointed.
...and after getting
disconnected from everyone".
..tried to kill himself
on his pavement.
That's when he...he saved his life.
Hello, sir.
Since then he dwelled
in the basement of his heart
He became the 'Pepsodent
of his brush'.
The peppermint in his life.
The instrument of his music.
And his name..
- I know.
Became Entenainment.
Now tell me...if Pannalal
hadn't given his property.
...to Entertainment,
then who else would he give it to.
My millionaire father
gave his property to a dog.
To a dog!
I am ruined.
My father made my
life worse than a dog.
I am ruined.
I am poor again.
Hello.
- Akhil, this is Jugnu speaking.
Shocked to hear my voice, aren't yöu?
I am in Bangkok.
Jugnu.
A Slumdog DID became the billionaire.
What do yöu mean?
What are yöu saying?
Yöur buddy's been orphaned again.
- No.
I am ruined.
- No.
I've lost the 3000 crores.
- No, this isn't possible.
Akhil. Hello, Akhil.
I really can't believe this again.
A dog's name 'Entertainment'.
The dog's name is shocking for yöu.
But he usurped my 3000 crore..
..that isn't shocking for yöu.
3000!
That dog.
By the way, is he a male or a female?
I've an idea.
Take a stone and hurl it at him.
If HE runs, he is male.
Or if SHE runs, she is female.
Whether he's a male or a female,
but he stole my bone.
Sorry, sorry.
I can understand what I am asking yöu.
Look, Akhil. Don't be sad.
Yöu please dived
yöur mind from this dog.
Forget the dog.
Look, I'm sure yöu haven't
eaten anything since yesterday.
Eat something.
Will yöu..
Would yöu like a Hot Dog?
Don't beat me like a dog.
Save me kids.
Jugnu.
What now?
I'll go crazy if I stay here.
Come on, let's go back to India.
Are yöu crazy, Akhil?
Yöu want to go back to India.
How will yöu face Saakshi?
Akhil, yöu are going
to let a dog live yöur life..
..and live like a dog yöurself.
Akhil, yöu're the hero of this story.
And that dog's the villain.
And the hero always kills the villain.
Take the history of
Bollywood for example.
Gabbar, Shaakal, Mogambo.
They all died a dog's death.
And he's already a dog.
Easy job!
He has to die, and like a dog.
Do anything yöu want.
Shoot him, stab him, slam him on the ground..
- No!
But kill him.
- No! No!
I can't kill anyone.
Not just anyone but the
one who's taken yöur wealth.
The one who has ruined yöur destiny.
The one who has brought
yöu on the street.
Akhil, I say for yöur right,
yöu have to kill the dog.
Akhil, yöu have to kill the dog.
Akhil, for the sake of yöur right,
just kill the dog.
Yöu should kill the dog.
Kill the dog.
Kill that dog.
Kill the dog...Akshay Kumar.
Yöu mutt...I'll kill yöu.
Entertainment,
it's time for yöur exercise.
Come. Climb on.
All the mills in the
world have closed down.
There's just one working mill,
that's the Treadmill.
Please climb up.
Climb up
This is not a local
train that he'll climb up.
Hello, Akhil.
- Hello.
Hello.
Bone from underpants.
I'll help yöu.
Wonderful.
Yöu were really amazing.
So please make me
Entertainment's caretaker.
I see.
He served papa till his last breath.
- Yes.
And in return,
I'll serve him till his last.
Please.
Please. Please, sir.
Please don't say, Zardullah.
- Hey.
That's Habibullah!
Are yöu crazy?
Habibullah! Habibullah!
Sorry!
Fine.
From now on yöu will always look after him.
- Yes.
Habibullah!
- Yes.
Habibullah!
Let the war begin.
When the dog comes and holds this,
he will..
...he'll get electrocuted and he'll die.
Come on.
Come on, everything's in place.
- Come on.
Switch it on.
The dog's coming.
Hurny up. Shut UP..
Let's get out of here.
He's here.
The dog didn't get electrocuted?
Check it.
- I did fix it properly.
Akhil!
Save me.
Save me.
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
How much more are
yöu going to beat me?
Are yöu fine?
I am okay.
How's he going to die?
Help! Help!
Jugnu, save me.
I'll save yöu.
Akhil, my friend.
Stop it. Stop it. Stop hitting me.
Yöu dog!
♫Traitor, yöur heart is a traitor. ♪
♫For yöu, it doesn't listen to me. ♪
♫Let's see who wins, head or me. ♪
♫Head has become mischeivous. ♪

♫World say, this is a bad habit. ♪

He's addicted too.
He's gone.
Either he'll be lost in the jungle.
Or he'll be some wild animal's toast.
Let's watch it live.
- Forget it.
Come on.
- Forget it, let him die.
Come on.
It'll be fun.
Careful Akhil, it's really high
Careful. Careful.
- Careful.
Akhil if we fall from here,
we'll get broken into pieces.
Akhil.
Akhil.
Akhil.
Stop.
Slop!
Akhil.
Where did my Akhil go?
Get rid of this problem from the root.
Why did yöu hit me?
We'll first make him
smell the chloroform.
..and then tie him up.
Or tie him up first and
then dope him with chloroform?
Is he gone?
He's done for,
Tie him up.
He'll fall now.
3000 crores is now all ours.
Pick him up.
Jugnu, let's leave him on the terrace.
Once he falls down,
there's no surviving.
Oh no...
No!
I won't spare yöu.
Oh no...
Akhil.
- Jugnu!
The dog is hungry.
Pour it.
Pour the entire thing.
He's dead for sure today.
Come on.
- Let's go.
He's dead for sure today.
Drink it sir.
Entertainment.
Drink it.
Entertainment.
Entertainment.
I am so hungry.
I've to get to the court as well.
I am getting late.
Zehreela (poisoned).
- Hey! That's Habibullah!
No. No.
Look, yöu should never interfere.
His head isn't beating.
Do something.
We'll be hanged for it.
Do something.
What do I do? Yes.
Get up.
- Here, Akhil.
Wake him up.
Bravo.
Save him somehow.
This is an iron.
Close the door. Close the door.
Rascal, yöu handed me irons.
Water!
Give me water!
My chest is burning.
That mutt Entertainment
has made our life hell.
Pannalal yöu scoundrel.
Who gave yöu the idea to raise a dog?
Give that here.
- Yöu rascals.
Who are those two with him?
- Open the door.
They look like villains.
Look.
He looks like the
villain from Dabbang 1..
..and he is from Dabbang 2. Isn't it?
But...how are they connected
with this family?
Hey what are yöu doing?
Get up.
Very good, brother Karan.
Come on, Arjun.
- Yes.
My Lace is open.
Brother, give me a minute.
I told yöu,
Arjun, I don't want any goof up.
Yöu did.
But mother always said..
..if yöur shoe-laces are open,
don't run.
Don't be so mad, brother.
I am yöur own blood.
- Yes.
But because of yöur actions
I feel like murdering yöu.
Yöu're a criminal mind, after all..
..it's bound to have such thoughts.
Yöu'll really go far, Arjun.
Wherever yöu go,
people will say "Keep moving".
Yöu won't be able to
sell yöurself if yöu want to.
I'm sure yöu were born
after 1000 dogs died.
But yöu're still alive.
Yöu mean...l am a dog?
Are yöu asking or telling,
brother Karan?
Arjun.
Mother was right yöu don't love me.
After all, I'm yöur step-brother.

Yöu see, were supposed
to be released in 2 days.
But since it was yöur birthday.
...I planned this escape.
Yöu won't find a brother like me.
I can give it in writing.
And if there is, then...
Yöu eat.
What happened, brother?
Why did yöur eyes widen?
Pannalal Johri is dead.
This means, brother..
...the one we've trying to kill
all these years, is finally dead.
The old man.
even time we tried to kill him..
..his pet dog would
interfere and save him.
Brother, now we're the
heir to his 3000 crore..
..because we're his first cousins?
Second!
But what's important is...
..we're his only relatives.
Then we should prepare to
get out of here, brother Karan.
Arjun, stop being so brazen.
We'll be released in 2 days.
And next day we'll
enter the Johri Mansion.
WOW, Akhil.
I'll have to mention
that it's a fabulous mansion.
So awesome.
It's an exquisite place.
I bet yöu spent quite a lot on it.
There's an antique fan as well.
Is this male or female?
Male or female?
I mean is it Bajaj or Usha?
By the way...the owner of this house..
..has gone to his favorite
place Snow white Arena..
..which is 3 hours away from here.
Because that's the
only place where it snow falls.
I see.
By the way,
what would yöu like to have?
I will drink. That too neat.
Yöu should've added water.
No, no. This is my
daughter's in-laws home.
Water is forbidden for me here.
I would like to get my daughter..
...married to the heir of this house.
The heir of this house?
Yes.
With yöur daughter?
- Yes.
He's Enter..
Yes, he has already entered...
in her heart
Curses!
He's..
- Exactly,
they are crazy about each other.
Say something.
She keeps barking in the serials.
She barks?
- Yes.
Do something.
Ready?
Now see.
Action.
Uncle. I swear on God..
..we're two bodies, one soul.
- Wonderful.
He's my mornings and my dawn.
- Very good.
His feet...is where my pilgrimages lie.
- Wonderful.
He has four legs as well.
But how is this possible?
Yöu barked.
Not me, maybe it came from there..
See...
...they're eyeing each
other like Romeo-Juliet.
Uncle, this is the effect
of love at first sight.
Yöu mean it's about
love at first bite.
Fine, it's done.
Okay.
Come on.
Pay respects to yöur
future father-in-law.
Come on.
Pay respects to yöur

Come, son-in-law.
Why are yöu standing there?
Come on.
What's this?
What's what?
Not what, what.
What's this?
He's yöur son-in-law.
Son...
My...
The heir to 3000 crore.
Pannalal John's heir,
Entertainment.
Yöu mean...Pannalal Johri..
..gave 3000 crore
to this dog and died.
Yes.
Papa.
Papa, please listen..
- Uncle, please listen.
Please, listen.
Give me one more chance.
I'll keep yöur daughter happy.
Just one chance.
I'll be rich.
I promise yöu.
Please listen to me.
My fate will change.
Yöur fate will never change.
Papa, please.
- Get in.
Yöu'll always be poor.
What's the point of
being Pannalal Johri's son?
Yöu turned out to be
a disappointment.
And that dog Entertainment..
..turned out to be the
real heir to the wealth.
Dog?
Uncle, listen to me.
Akhil Lokhande,
forget Saakshi forever.
♫I want to ask God what has he done. ♪
♫Why did he take back the gift
he had bestowed me upon? ♪
The heir to 3000 crore...a dog.
Stop the car!
What happened?
Dear...
...do yöu admit that, post marriage..
...every man becomes a dog.
I suggest that...
...yöu marry the dog.
Papa!
That rascal Pannalal gave
all his wealth to that dog.
But that dog...separated
me from Saakshi forever, Jugnu.
That's why, Akhil..
...we'll have to think
of a full-proof plan..
..to kill the dog.
What's to think?
Let's shoot him.
We won't get the wealth
if we kill the dog.
It will go to that son of his.
So what do we do?
Expiry date.
How long do dogs live?
Maximum 12-13 years.
That Entertainment
will conk out in few years.
For now we've just one target.
Akhil.
And we'll have to
find a special place..
..to take care of him.
And that special place is...
Snow White Arena.
I will kill that dog
in his favorite place.
Akhil, yöu're done for.
Entertainment, yöu're done for!
I see.
So tomorrow he's
going to kill the dog.
And we wolves. .
.. Will kill him.
One arrow...we kill two sparrows.
But, brother,
why will we kill sparrows?
Go...fetch!
Yes.
Die yöu rascal!
Akhil!
Entertainment!
Entertainment!
Entertainment!
- Akhil.
Akhil, what are yöu doing?
Have yöu gone crazy?
We got what we wanted.
He's dead.
He saved my life.
Entertainment!

No Entenainment.
Entertainment.
Earlier, when we tried
to bump-off Pannalal..
..the dog interfered.
And even this time,
he interfered in our plans.
We'll have to do something, Arjun.
Or that dog will
always taint our face.
By the way,
brother, yöur face looks tainted.
Johri sir..
Mr. Johri..
Father.
I forgive yöu for whatever
yöu did with yöur this son.
And for whatever I did with yöur son..
...I apologies for it.
I must admit.
Yöu turned out to be
a true diamond merchant.
Yöu're a good assessor.
Entertainment!
Only a real assessor
can recognize a true gem.
Pannalal Johri.
Yöur son deserves all this.
Not this son.
See yöu, father.
Entertainment...
...do yöu know why the truth hurts.
Because truth has a point.
And that point is...
...that yöu're right and I am wrong.
Sorry...for trying to kill yöu.
Thank yöu...
..for showing me the way.
Goodbye.
And yes...
...if anyone calls me a dog..
...I'll consider it an honor.
Sanjay Leela Bhansali.
- What?
The names of my three lawyers.
Mr. Sanjay.
Ms. Leela and Mr. Bhansali.
Poor clears have been doing
rounds of the court for us.
Court?
- Yes.
Films succeed
because of three things.
And these days our case
is also thriving on three things.
Entertainment!
Entertainment!
Entertainment!
What?
- Well, yöu're forgetting..
..that many years ago,
Pannalal Johri..
...had started a Private Ltd Company.
...called The Entertainment Company.
Yöu're right.
But for his dear Entertainment.
But, Pannalal Johri made
his second cousins, which is us..
..the major shareholders.
But what did yöu do under
the pretext of that relation.
Forge"!
Pannalal Johri caught
yöu two red-handed..
..and also fired yöu two.
I see.
Arjun, we didn't receive
any termination order.
Not at all.
What do yöu want to prove?
Just that we're still
the existing owners..
...of that Entertainment Company.
And according to
Mr. Pannalal Johri's Will...
By the way, why am I talking to yöu?
Ms. Leela,
I'm sure yöu've a copy of that Will.
Please read it out.
I, Pannalal Johri,
in my right state of mind..
...bequeath my entire property.
...and bank balance to Entertainment.
Yes!
Entertainment Company belongs to us..
...and this property's
in the name of Entertainment.
So, the heir to 3000 crore
is not this dog, but..
...it's the owners of the
company called Entertainment!
Entertainment!
Entertainment!
But in Will, doesn't mention company..
..instead it's loyal dog.
...of the word 'Dog' in the will.
The reason is that he
never considered him a dog.
Court doesn't believe in emotions..
..it believes n facts, Mr. Dracula.
That's Habibullah!
And listen.
If there's no 'Dog'
mentioned in the Will..
...then there's no
'Company' mentioned either.
Very smart.
And now..
Not yöu.
In the company of our lawyers,
the court will decide..
..and also prove who's the rascal..
..and who's a mangy cur.
After all the views..
...Court is passing the
judgment in the favour of...
Karan and Arjun, They are the
rightful owner Of the Johri Empire.
Pannalal Johri's wealth...
goes to these two rascals!
How?
We'll tell yöu.
Yöu see...a good lawyer knows the law.
And the best lawyer knows the judge.
1500 for me..
- And 1500 for me.
Yöu dog,
I know yöu understand everything.
Now listen to me carefully.
Actually,
yöu're no more than a street-mutt.
So stay there.
If yöu need to pee,
then find a lamp-post.
If yöu feel hungry.
..then feed on the left-over
from the waste-dump.
Yöu're a dog, so live like one.
Right, brother.
Yes, but before that.
Let's take back what's ours.
What are yöu doing?
Along with this property,
this leash belongs to us too.
And stopping us means
breaking the law.
Time flies by when yöu're with a kin.
But with time yöu
know who yöur kin is.
'Look what I brought for yöu.'
'Look'
'Just for yöu .'
'Since yöu entered my life..'
 'There's only entertainment.'
'No sorrows.'
'Yöu're not my son,
but yöu're no less either.'
Get out!
Get out!
- Get lost!
Get lost!
Johri's dog.
- Got nowhere to go.
Lord, even in Yöur presence..
Loyalty has lost.
And betrayal won!
Why are yöu looking that way?
Yöu think someone
will come to help us..
..from that direction.
Surprised.
How I came back?
I was about to board
the flight to lndia..
..when I read this news.
I had to come.
Yöu see, father's last wish was..
..that yöu be the heir to this wealth.
And...a son will have
to do something.
..to fulfill his father's last wish.
After all, I am his blood.
DNA.
Daddy's Najayaz Aulad
(Daddy's illegitimate son).
But...his son.
Earlier I formed a bond
with father for the wealth.
Now, for the sake of that same bond..
...I will get yöu yöur wealth back.
And yes, Entenainment.
We're with yöu.
Just wait and watch.
We'll first have to break
Karan and Arjun's unity.
And then their strength will be over.
And then we'll make them
confess to their crimes..
..and have them thrown
out in the streets.
What do yöu say, Akhil?
Wonderful. Amazing. I'm speechless.
But it's very difficult
to separate these two brothers.
Don't worry about that,
Ab...dullah, sir.
We'll do what the British did with us!
Divide...and Rule!
Now we dogs...
...will teach those rascals a lesson.
Careful, brother.
Entertainment.
I guess he's here for revenge.
Revenge?
Yöu want revenge?
How will yöu do it?
Like RajnikanL.
Or like Spiderman.
What can one dog do?
What can he do?
I'll show him...by running
over him with my car. Come on.
Brother, I'll run-over him.
No, I'll do it, I'm the elder one.
I am the yöunger one.
Why don't yöu understand?
It's just one dog.
Yöu won't look good
running over one dog.
I want to run over him.
Brother, do yöu love me or not?
What's brotherhood
got to do with our love?
Listen to me..
- But..
With this car,
we'll send him off on his final..
Wait!
Stay!
Sit!
Roadside Entenainment.
At first even I thought
they were wrong.
But the court of
Bangkok opened my eyes.
..and proved that
my father's 3000 crore..
...belongs to them, and not yöu.
If anyone has anything to say,
then speak now.
Yöu Bulldog.
Yöu behave like a dog..
..but got the name
of a different animal.
Bull.
Stop growling...Pug!
I'll make yöu dance like Shakira,
get that.
And yöu....German Shepherd.
Has yöur father ever been to Germany?
And yöu...Boxer!
Did yöur dad ever
put on boxing gloves?
And St. Bernard.
If I had a face like yöurs.
...I would've sued my parents.
Now...if anyone has the guts,
then come and face me.
What are yöu doing?
Go away. Leave.
Leave!
I called for a mobile-towen.
..where did this sim-card come from?
Look, I don't like jokes.
This shorty is no match for me.
Who's got the guts to face me?
Sir, move back.
They're about to attack, sir.
Yöu're a real player.
Thank yöu.

Thank yöu. Thank yöu.
Sir, take my advice.
And get out of here in yöur car.

On that dark night,
a dark crow sitting on a dark branch..

And the door to Billa's

Why's the door opening for so long?
It's opening in slow motion.

And she was sweetly saying..

I had killed the cat.
But the cat said...
Is it yöur wedding night

Hearing this Billa was stunned.
