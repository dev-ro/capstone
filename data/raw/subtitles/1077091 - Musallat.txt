People in the neighborhood had some
worries about these people, too.
We were very scared of how they were.
Since they weren't talking to anyone,
of course we could not get to know them.
You never know.
No one goes to this place where
the house is.
It will be wrecked, we are scared, too,
we cannot go.
An awful incident,
everyone is trying to forget about it.
I would be lying if I say I am not scared.
We are doubtful now.
I know uncle Burhan, but indeed
I am a friend of his son Sebahattin.
This is destiny. Nothing can be said
about uncle Burhan's circumstance.
Nothing can be done.
May God have mercy on him.
I don't want to talk to about this.
Learn, tell others, take precautions...
...and never forget!
It was the darkest day's brightest night.
The things which should be done
were enlightening the path.
He should be buried where he was born.
To the far village where everything started
and came to end.
We have a been apprised that.
We are not alone in this world.
Whatever have happened to us happened
because of neglecting this revelation.
Everything started nine months ago.
Oh brother, you have got used to
this life in two weeks.
Tea bag, kettle etc...
No, no. I haven't got used to it at all.
I don't think I will in this place,
I can't even anjoy a cup of tea.
You will get used to it bro, don't worry.
It's been twelve years,
all my family got accustomed.
Even my grandmother got used to it.
She doesn't sleep without
eating Berlin Donut.
They forgot the people in the village
and later on they brought all family here.
Look at this.
Sweet, look at us.
How many years has it been.
It has been fourteen years.
We have spent our childhood there Suat.
If your father wasn't there,
I would have drowned in the stream.
May God rest his soul,
may he rest in peace.
Amen!
Being away is very tough.
I've missed them a lot, Metin.
Bro, don't care so much.
Two-three years aren't that long.
They pass in the blink of an eye.
And after two years,
you will bring Nurcan here.
I hope so.
Hello.
Ok, Ok.
I am at Suat's, ok.
I am leaving now.
Are you sleeping Suat?
Come on, Suat.
Today is our day.
You have never waken up Suat.
Hey, you.
I can't sleep because of you.
If you turn up the volume again...
...I will call the police.
Suat what's up? How is it going?
Are there any problems?
No, there aren't any problems but...
I don't feel well at all.
- How do you feel bro?
- I am having very bad dreams.
Dreams, what dreams?
Like nightmares.
Forget about it bro.
It must be because of the weather.
It's not like our village.
And how many days have
passed since you came here.
You've been here for a short time.
Come on, let's talk while we eat.
Look, let me explain the situation.
Germany is equal to working hard.
You will work and work here
and won't care about anything.
People who work are the ones who
make money brother.
Look around you,
are there any hungry people here?
I don't know if money will solve
my problems.
Why did you come here, then?
Not for money?
Yes but it is a language which
I don't know a single word of it.
Look around!
Everyone is a foreigner.
You are my only friend.
Thanks a lot brother, thanks.
It is a life struggle bro.
Everyone likes to be with his father,
mother and the loved ones.
But how are you going to make
money in the village?
I can't explain, anyway.
I don't have much appetite,
enjoy your meal.
Look at it, an idiot.
Mum, it's me.
What's the matter son?
I am not well mum. I can't breathe,
I am stressed out.
Well then...
Everything is alright here son, thanks God.
There is a little drought but they say
it is going to rain this week, we'll see.
I don't fell well mum,
don't you understand?
I'm not sure if I've done
the right thing by coming here.
How is Nurcan, does she ask about me?
Fine, fine my son,
I am glad...
How is Metin's family?
Thanks to them,
you are making money.
Ok, take care.
Mum...
ONE MONTH LATER
What would you like to do,
should we go out and take a walk?
You've got depressed.
Let's think for ourselves.
I'm tired Metin,
I'm going home to rest.
I get exhausted in the night shift, too.
It fucks up my routine.
Nothing is better than sleeping at night.
I don't have any routine at all,
so it doesn't make any difference for me.
Get few days off if you want,
you get rest.
Anyway, we'll talk.
Metin hurry up,
something is wrong with Suat.
Hurry up something
is wrong with Suat.
Suat.
I'm allright, I felt dizzy.
Let me talk to
Boss and take time off for you.
Suat, what's wrong with you?
I don't know, really I don't know.
What's up with you Suat?
Take these pills, too.
(arabic speaking)
My God, please help me.
Please help.
THREE MONTHS LATER
So, what's the important thing you
wanted to talk about...
Tell me so we can find a solution...
Metin, listen...
You are my only friend...
I am not going to talk much.
I am not embarrassed.
Everybody here think that I am crazy...
Don't talk nonsense...
Don't be stupid, you are just
a bit confused, that's all.
Brother, you are my only support bro!
I want you to lend me some money.
Rent, tickets, expenses etc.
If only I can manage for a couple
of months, that's all.
Then you are sure.
It hasn't worked out Metin,
I couldn't make it.
I am going back for good.
When I go back,
I promise to pay you back.
You don't understand me Suat.
Money isn't the problem.
I don't understand you Suat.
You are handsome, young,
you are in Germany, employed...
Stop thinking about Nurcan.
You are going to come
together one way or another.
You worry too much.
Come on, let's go!
You are just struggling a bit.
Let's have fun tonight.
Ok?
Ok?
Taxi.
You are going straight back home.
Don't even think about sleeping,
I am coming soon.
You are going to be a father, my son!
Is everything allright?
Oh brother, having a good time?
Thanks, but...
Who is this handsome?
What is this?
I made a favor for you.
I don't want her, take her away!
Come on, of course you want it,
she is not going to bite you.
All right, you go in and have fun.
I am pregnant.
I am going to have a baby.
What are you doing, are you crazy?
Suat what happened?
Suat what happened?
Metin take them away...
Please go.
All right.
I am going to take them home.
Don't thing about anything and relax.
Call me if you need anything.
I don't understand what's
wrong with you. Let's go.
Let's leave this place immediately.
Hello mum.
How are you my son?
Mum I feel very bad.
Good, be well son.
Don't you hear mum, I feel awful,
strange things are going on.
Good, what did you do about the job?
Mum what job,
I want to go back to Turkey.
How is Nurcan?
I couldn't get in touch with her.
I am having very bad dreams.
I can't stand anymore.
Ok my son, Ok.
How are the Metin's family?
Metin?
Mum, are you making fun of me?
I want to leave this place as
soon as possible.
I will lose my mind.
We have to wait and see my son.
Take care.
Mum wait.
Mum, don't hang up. Mum.
Suat, I have good news for you.
I've talked to the Boss, they are
very happy about your performance.
Plus you will get a raise.
All your problems will be over.
I don't want to hear "I
want to go back" anymore.
FIVE MONTHS LATER
Good days, welcome.
One way ticket to Ankara please.
What is your name?
Suat Ã–zdal.
When is the first plane?
I am checking.
Suat, son.
Mum!
What kind of a son are you?
- Sir. Sir are you allright?
- Stay here.
I am pregnant.
I don't want you.
Don't come back.
I don't belong to you.
Suat, my son, don't come back.
Kill yourself, jump down!
Just end your life.
Find your salvation.
Have you lost your mind?
Everything seems fine.
Go to a shrink if you want.
Suat, you really need to
go back to Turkey.
But I can't send you
to the village like this.
First of all we are going to Istanbul
to find a solution to your problem. Ok?
Many people have regained their
health with this Hadji Burhan.
Everything is going to be fine,
you will see Suat.
Taxi.
Dad we are going to the neighbors.
Ok.
Goodbye grandpa.
You come with me.
What happened?
In order to control himself...
...he had to understand
importance of his own life.
So did he?
He did. He raised his arms
and protected himself.
I am going to write a charm.
He will take care of himself
and we will take care of him.
Thank you so much.
How much do we owe you?
Your debt is to the God.
We try to help those who can not
protect themselves alone...
...from the evil with our prayers.
There is no debt here.
All right,
come back again tomorrow.
Metin, what is happening to me?
You are going to be fine bro.
Why are you helping me?
What kind of a question is this.
There is no coincidence in life Suat?
Don't you see,
we met after so many years.
Obviously there is a reason for this.
Aren't we buddies?
Thanks.
Thank you, too.
Let's sleep,
we will get up early in the morning.
- Hello.
- Hello. Welcome.
Welcome,
my father is about to come.
Come on daughter, go to your mum.
This must be my dad.
Come on, let's go in.
My father is waiting
for you in the room.
What is your sin?
I've thought a lot.
But there isn't any.
There is no human being without sin.
We all have sins.
Immediately after the migration to
Medina an agreement was signed.
All the creatures would
stay in their own spaces...
...and they would not go into
the spaces of other creatures.
But it didn't happen in this way.
First the humans disrespected
the agreement.
Come closer.
Sir.
What do you think,
is he going to be fine?
We are going to try.
Many people in this situation come to me.
But this one seems to be a little difficult.
So what are you going to do sir?
In people's relations with them...
...so far people have always suffered.
I will just remind them the agreement
and draw the boundaries.
Hopefully you will heal Suat,
too, sir.
We trust you.
We think that you are
a great scholar in this issue.
Being a scholar doesn't solve everything.
Those who come to me
should be faithful, too.
Knowledge and faith go side by side
up to a certain point...
...at one point they depart from each other.
Then whatever the cure for your
problem is, you follow that path.
We pray for you Sir.
Do you have a long way,
where are you staying?
By the street sir, Demircan Hotel.
You are not calling Nurcan.
But why didn't you tell your mum
that you came to Istanbul?
What would I say?
"I've lost my mind and Metin is
taking me to a hodja to recover"?
You right.
Even if I call,
I can't talk to her, anyway.
She doesn't hear me.
She is telling me some other things.
I can't explain my problem.
She is an old woman...
...may be she
really doesn't hear you.
- Hello.
- Hello welcome.
Let's go in to the room.
You come in, too,
you will be the witness.
You come next to me.
Come son.
Look son, what do you see?
A bathhouse.
What else?
There are women.
What else?
A girl is having a bath.
What else?
Nothing else.
Look, carefully!
Don't be scared.
Ok son, that's enough.
Allright.
Get dressed in the room.
Dad?
Very bad.
Marid or lfrit's action.
It used Avamir on him.
Is this possible?
Yes it is.
If there is something
he can not leave...
...or it can not be far away someone...
...it sends Avamir.
What doesn't it want to leave?
May be a human being.
If this is the case,
may God help him.
You seem better.
Thanks a lot.
I kept you away from your job.
I can take time off any time Suat.
You should recover as soon as possible.
The Boss started to grumble.
I don't know how to say it.
The Boss isn't happy about
your performance at all, Suat.
You said that he was very happy
with my performance.
None of them could stay to this curse.
But it didn't come.
What does this mean?
Gave up about his existence.
So?
Complicated, very complicated.
I feel exhausted.
I'll go out and get some air.
If the same thing had happened to you,
I don't know if I could do the same for you.
Well everybody is different.
If I wasn't with my family...
I couldn't make it in a foreign country.
Thanks to your family,
they've supported me a lot.
I don't know how I will pay back them.
Thanks a lot Metin.
Don't be silly.
Suat we've been living in Germany
for 12 years.
Until you came here,
I didn't even have one friend, trust me.
You are my childhood friend.
Off course I will help you.
I give you my word,
as soon as you get better...
...we will go to the village together.
I hope so.
I am going to sleep.
Ok go to sleep.
I am coming soon, too.
Hi mum.
We are fine mum, everything is ok.
He is fine, too.
He went upstairs to sleep.
We'll be there in two days.
Ok, say hi to my dad.
Suat.
Suat.
Suat.
Suat.
Oh my God.
Hello.
Ok, calm down.
I am coming right away.
What happened dad?
There is nothing to worry.
Dad?
You stay with Zeynep and the kid.
I'll be back soon.
For God's sake, where are you going?
Close the door.
Dad, let me come with you.
Give me the key.
And close this.
Dad?
Sir he is upstairs.
Sir I didn't know what to do.
I didn't know what to do sir.
May God rest his soul.
He was caught unprepared.
He should be immediately
buried in his village.
Sir, we should call the police.
We may get into trouble.
Is there a bigger trouble than this?
If you want go and tell the police...
...explain them how your friend's legs
and feet got broken.
Or help me.
You stay here.
Still there is no news.
I asked him, where are you going?
He got in the car and left.
Don't worry he will come back.
He is a grown up,
there is nothing to worry about.
He became different after
my mother's death.
Anyway, be patient.
BÃ¼Ã¾ra, come on, do your homework.
Stop playing.
20 liras sir.
Here you go.
- Thank you. Have a good evening.
- Thanks, you too.
BÃ¼Ã¾ra, don't be scared my child.
Look at me!
Burhan. Look, look carefully!
So, what was the reason for
all these things?
All these misfortunes,
all these curces?
The reason was obvious.
Love.
A great love.
It was a misfortuned love.
If people knew how great
this love was...
...they would have
stayed away from her.
They would have
never tried to have her.
I am going to talk to Suat.
Come on Suat, let's have a talk.
Listen Suat.
Nurcan is a sensitive girl.
She has an illness, too, you know.
I know.
Be kind to her.
It's her first night.
Ok.
Women would get a cold feet
if you push them too much.
Ok, thanks.
Good boy.
You are very beautiful Nurcan.
Welcome.
Thank you.
You are my wife now.
Stop.
Don't be late.
Allright mum, I am going.
Goodbye son.
So what happened?
Nothing happened,
I am just too scared to do it.
Don't be scared.
At first I was scared, too.
Later you get used to it.
Thanks daughter.
Oh, what's the matter?
ONE MONTH LATER
Suat when you get close to me
I get suffocated.
Don't be scared.
Be relax.
I am ashamed.
You are my woman, my wife.
It has been a month since
we got married.
There is nothing to be ashamed of.
Suat.
It is like you have been mine for years.
Since I saw you first time.
I let myself to you.
For years?
You don't know.
I have been in love with you for
a really long time Nurcan.
Although you didn't know,
you were mine.
You waited a long time
by hiding this from me.
I had to hide.
Why?
If you loved me so much.
Why did you wait so many years?
Because you couldn't understand
my love to you.
I couldn't explain to anyone.
Many people in this village
wanted to marry me.
Why didn't you go to my dad
and asked him.
What if he had married me to
someone else?
I wouldn't allow it.
You have always been mine.
Where did you go
at this time of the night.
Dogs were making noises.
I wondered.
Why didn't you turn off the tap?
THREE MONTHS LATER
An old villager was coming back from
a district bazaar late in the evening.
It was pitch black.
He said to himself,
let me climb this slope.
And get some rest under the fig tree.
He climbed up looked around.
There were four men under the tree.
They had wonderful food.
Everything you can imagine.
The old man said, may it be blessed.
He was about to walk away.
They invited him.
So he joined.
The four guys started to eat.
The old man prayed to God
before eating.
Suddenly, the men turned into dwarfs.
And meals into dog shit.
These are lies.
Don't talk like that.
These things really happened.
Mum, I will tell you something.
I am listening.
I haven't had it for three months.
What haven't you had?
Oh, are you pregnant?
I think so.
Do you have blackout, queasiness?
I gagged twice today.
Great!
Congratulations!
What is going on?
You are going to be a father.
Nurcan!
Be careful.
Go inside.
Are you sleeping?
Aren't you eating Suat?
You are so beautiful Nurcan.
Don't say so,
I am getting embarrassed.
Are you still embarrassed from
your husband?
Soon we are going to be
four people in the house.
You will be a mother.
Why don't you eat.
I will go out for a few minutes.
You always disappear.
I get scared.
What are you afraid of?
Your mother and I,
two women alone in the house.
Ok. I am not going anywhere.
Suat, your mother and I are going to
go to the bathhouse.
No.
I don't want you to go to there.
What's the matter, for so
many months, God forbids.
FIVE MONTHS LATER
Is she still having queasiness?
I don't know.
They say if it is
a boy it makes queasiness.
It has nothing to do with this.
Bring me scissors and a knife.
Why?
Just bring them to me.
Let's hide them under the pillow.
- Here they are.
- Give them to me.
If she sits over the knife, it is a boy.
If she sits over the scissors, it is a girl.
Allright, you know so much.
Sit down.
Come and sit next to me
and let's have a chat.
I am very tired mum.
Come on my beautiful girl,
sit in front of us.
Let us see your face
and have few words with you.
You are so bad tempered,
I hope this baby won't look like you.
What would happen
if you had sat with us?
I don't want to mum,
I don't feel like doing it.
We hould get going.
You behaved shamefully.
You humiliated me in
front of the neighbors.
Learn to behave respectfully.
Shameless.
Come son.
Come and see your mum's situation.
What's the matter?
I was humiliated in front of everyone.
Is Nurcan inside?
She is inside, crying.
She gets offented from everthing.
You disappear very often.
I am confused what to do son.
Nurcan.
If you yell at her once again,
I'll suffocate you!
What kind of child are you?
Do you understand?
Everything will be fine,
don't worry.
I am leaving now.
I will come back as soon as possible.
Where are you going, again?
I'll be back.
It has been two days since he left.
I worry about him.
He didn't say where he has gone,
he was very angry.
It is our fault.
He got very angry.
I am very scared mum.
Don't be scared, I am here.
Where have you been Suat?
Wake up Suat. I think, it is time!
I'll be back.
Her water has come!
Come on my girl, come on push, push.
A little bit harder.
It will be over soon.
Oh my God!
This is the seed of an evil!
It should be killed immediately!
Everthing was your fault.
None of these would happen
if you didn't fall in love with her.
Now vanish
and never breathe again!
...and never forget!
Learn, tell others,
take precautions...
This cursed love started years ago.
The one from another dimension fell in love
with someone from our dimension.
The one that was created from fire...
...fell in love with the one
that was created from earth.
He loved her for years.
Secretly.
Everything was going well for it.
He owned her.
Until a stranger wanted to take her.
This stranger was going to go far away.
And he would come back
and take her.
But that stranger could never come back.
He was restrained.
The thing which kept him there...
...cas a great love which he
could not even dream about.
And the owner of this love...
...submitted for his love.
He had to live in a human shape.
For its love, it even accepted to
live in another creature's form.
It was beyond imagination!
It had to learn everything.
It happened at the same time!
It happened at the same time!
It happened at the same time!
Hello mum, I want to get out
of here as soon as possible.
I don't feel well mum, don't you
hear? Strange things are going on.
Its love was unique.
Its was incomparable.
Its love was from this world.
But itself not.
Everyone who involved in
this curse took his share.
And me?
Could I be considered mad since
I have to write these things.
Either you can see these events
as a madman's absurdity...
...or call these writings as written
under a great influence.
I have seen these things.
It was wrong.
Completely wrong.
It was a great love but...
...it was wrong.
Learn, tell others,
take precautions...
...and never forget!
Don't ever neglect the
curse under the great love.
Always look carefully...
...to the people around you.
Very carefully.
Suat went to Germany to work there.
He was planning to come back
in couple of years.
A few weeks later...
...he could not
stand it and came back.
But the one who
came back, wasn't him.
He always seemed sick at work.
He couldn't get used to Germany,
he couldn't make it.
And he had to go back to Turkey.
Since Nurcan's childhood.
She used to faint quite often.
We thought that she would get better
after getting married.
But there were things we didn't know.
Some people used to go to Hadji Burhan.
We didn't know what he was
doing in his house.
No one was in his house.
He took his son, daughter in law,
grandchild and left.
Hadji Burhan was a bipolar person.
He is getting psychiatric
treatment rifgt now.
