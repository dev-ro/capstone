In every speck shines His divine light
Look within yourself,
He isn't far from you
If you have love in you,
then embrace everyone
Because we are all in His form.
That's worship
What would have happened
if the red-headed man...
...hadn't woken up at dawn that day
to relieve himself?
Perhaps life would have carried
on in Delhi-6 as it had for centuries
And my life might not have been
turned upside down
But then again
When you got to go, you got to go!
In the Treta Age of the Vedic era
The evil ten-headed Ravan ruled supreme
The Sun, Moon, Wind and Fire
were enslaved to Ravan
Who could save the universe from Ravan?
A divine voice spoke: "I will be born
as Ram in Awadh to save you"
The tumour is close to her area of vision
Fatima, ask the fool how long I've got?
Ma, don't say that! Allah forbid it
Who do you have in India?
Did these five years with us bore you?
No, child. But you must merge with
the soil on which you are born
Ma, these are old proverbs
Son, think of it as my last wish
Ma, you're like a stubborn child
You make life difficult
You know I'll never go back to Delhi.
I couldn't see well in the dark.
He was 8ft. 2
Covered in black hair
His nails shone like knives
Anyone who dares to sleep is dead!
He'll creep up on you at night
He'll kill you. Murder you. Who is he?
Yes! The murderer is a monkey
A dark Black Monkey!
The Black Monkey kills.
The Black Monkey murders
Beware! 24/7. From Delhi, Kumar
The first one to welcome me
to Delhi was the Black Monkey
Maybe destiny was sending me a sign
Would you care for a paan?
Salaam, Mrs. Mehra
Now I can die in peace
My love dragged you back, didn't it?
I forgot all about you
Recognise him?
At last! Now my eyes can rest
forever now. Let me hug you
Come on! Give me a hug
I'm Ali Baig!
A flood of people!
Delhi is teeming with life
Everything happening at the same time.
Yet there is a kind of balance
You can't enter like this
First sweeten your mouth
Mamdu! How are you?
You're back at last!
Salaams, Hina! My sister-in-law
Why the long face?
Aren't you looking after her?
Gobar! Bless you, son
Guess who's here!
My grandson. Roshan
He isn't hungry
Only dogs eat when they're hungry.
Humans eat to bond with each other
Have one
Only the lucky few taste
Mamdu's sweets
Or you can't go through
My beloved has returned home
People have great faith in this place
They say if you hang a bell
with a pure heart
God will heed you
I hung a bell before I left and prayed...
...to return with my whole family
God heard me. At least in part
Home at last! Your Paswaan Lane
It's hasn't changed a bit
Your phone is ringing
Not mine
You must rest. I'll take your leave
- Have tea with us
- Some other time
Make sure you drop by
That's my ball
Got it!
Mrs. Mehra is back
- How are you, Rajjo?
- You look lovely
Welcome to Delhi 6. How do you do?
I am Rajjo
Rama!
Rama. Bless you
A local speciality
Home at last!
Roshan! Unlock the door
- Which one?
- The small one
The tulsi plant has dried. Some water
No water now
The tap runs only in the morning
It's like the government.
Works on a whim
Nothing like Mother Earth!
I was just 16
Your grandfather married me
and brought me here
I'll leave the world from this place now
Gran...
This way
Don't waste water. It's precious
Overflowing with emotion.
That's the beauty of India for you
Love is never given in small doses
Here, taps may run dry.
But amazingly tear ducts never do
Your grandfather! He never accepted
your parents' marriage
Never listened to anyone
"How is it possible?"
It chewed him up till he died
He'd say: "How can my son
marry a Muslim?"
I wasn't happy either
When I got to know your mother...
...I knew I was wrong
Damn it!
Must the power go now?
Your father was just as stubborn
My husband said: "Get out!"
So he left
And refused to come back
Except for once.
For your grandpa's funeral
See God's miracle, Roshan?
You were born on the same night
"Everything that happens is God's will"
Only his moustache sets you apart
You're still not ready?
Ravan is on his way to kidnap Sita
My scarf! Hey, mister
Can't you see? Shall I buy you specs?
Gran!
Lord Ram was born in Awadh
to put an end to all suffering
Salaams, Mrs. Mehra
Mamdu? Right?
I can't enter without eating
something sweet, right?
How are you, Madangopal?
Well. Thanks to the Goddess
Bittu! Isn't she Bittu?
How thin you are.
You were once so chubby
You're a stick now
- Her American grandson
- Must I dance for joy?
Roshan. She's Bittu. Their daughter
- 20 rupees from me
- And a donation of 50 from me
Why be stingy with
the Benevolent One? Right?
Miserly with his sister...
...but loves showing off in public
You brothers never stop fighting.
Have you no shame?
You look dashing!
Young man, not Miss. Mrs!
Myself Jaigopal Sharma,
proprietor Jaigopal Electrical Works
I won the contract
for all the lighting. Right?
Donation, Mrs. Mehra
Gobar! Don't pester her. Come here.
What will you take?
One ten-rupee note?
Or two one-rupee coins?
One ten-rupee note?
Or two one-rupee coins?
One note? I'll take two coins
He's got straw for brains
Time for a group photo.
Paswaan Lane! Stand close together
Are we in?
My star of Delhi-6. When are you
heading to Mumbai?
I can go anytime.
I'm giving the others a chance
Don't forget the 2500 you owe me!
Right?
Jaigopalji, forget about me.
Tell me about your shirt. By God!
I had better visit Malayasia too
Look! The moneylender's wife
is decked out like his jewellery store
So our wives nag us
to buy the same jewels
Then pawn them right back to him
Let me photograph you
and your lovely wife
Greetings, Annapurnaji
Pay your respects!
May you both live long!
Lalaji! Meet Rajan's son.
Roshan
Are you here to stay?
No. I came to leave her
What's your name?
Roshan Mehra
Any plans for the house?
Lalaji, I'm still alive!
- I'll fetch you a good price
- Can family heritage be sold?
There's no family left
Money is better than bricks and mortar.
Right, son?
You burger species!
With an arrow as sharp as His gaze
He stuck the golden deer
The golden deer
changed into the demon Marich
O Brother Laxman!
Ram is calling for help
As Laxman leaves,
the demon king Ravan appears
Sita hears his cry for alms!
The sage implores: "Give alms
in the name of God"
"God keep you well"
The sage insists: "Sita, step out of
the ring of fire. Hand me the offering"
As Sita stepped out,
the sage turned into the demon Ravan
You sinner! O Lord Ram, save me!
Ladiesand gentlemen
We are proud to welcome...
...Maitri Devi, the councillor for Delhi 6
The honourable lady is here
On behalf of the Ram Leela committee...
...we'd like to garland her
"May the rule of Ram reign forever.
I may die but I'll never break a promise!"
Lord Ram who sacrificed
everything in the name of duty...
...at His feet...
...I offer donation money
on behalf of my party and me
Please accept it
Join me when I say:
"Long live Ram and Sita!"
Long live Lord Hanuman!
Long live Maitri Devi!
In India, the gods dance
to the whims of politicians
I thoroughly enjoyed the Ram Leela
But even more fascinating
were the people
I was so exhausted.
But the real drama was yet to unfold
Hanuman! Go and see.
Two men have entered the forest
Hanuman! Where are you?
Where has Lord Hanuman gone?
Hanumanji, it's your cue.
They're looking for you
A monkey!
The Black Monkey!
The Black Monkey!
You slow poke
Manager! Come here
- Is he the one?
- No
Balls of a wimp! It's not him either.
Aren't you an expert at grabbing tails?
Carry on!
Whose phone is that?
Whose tail is ringing?
Yes? Hello!
Inspector sir, the phone
belongs to Roshan
Roshan! I've found it
What species is he?
Sir, please let me go
Did I give you permission to stop?
Who's this?
Roshan, let's go
Shall I slap his left cheek too?
Know who I am?
You must be a public servant
Balls of a wimp! Do I look like a servant?
There maybe few highways,
but there's always a way out
Thank you, Inspector sir
Mr Baig
Tell him how the wind blows.
This is India
You bow to a uniform. No choice
What did you do?
I offered him a paan
Wrapped in a bank note
This is Delhi, my friend
Offering you nothing
but love and affection
Delhi is a place for those who love life
A place where crazed lovers live
It holds you in a tight embrace
It lets you hear its heartbeat
Hearts to your left
Hearts to your right
This is not a city but a gathering of lovers
This is Delhi, my friend
Offering you nothing
but love and affection
- Specs...
- Do I need them?
Why the toothpaste grin?
Sunita, the scene today is:
Show some flesh, hide some
You want 4x6? 5x7? Laminated?
You've wasted my whole day
I have beauty. I have heart.
Apretty face and I'm smart
Apretty face and I'm smart
I, Bittu Sharma, will be your
new Indian Idol
Loosen up! Relax.
Be a little sexy!
Hey mister, watch your step.
Tread carefully on the path of love
The path of love
is strewn with cheats
Not bad! You forgot your lipstick today
No, I didn't. It got rubbed off
When do my lips try that?
What?
Your hair!
Your hands are too frisky.
Control them
They have a will of their own.
What a dirty mind!
Maybe they want something
Bittu, you never take me seriously
You'll appreciate me when
I make you an Indian Idol
Not a bad photographer.
You can cover my wedding
They're in black and white. No colour
- I see life in black and white
- But rainbows fill the Mumbai sky
Models! Money
I must make some money
But to make money you need money
Suresh!
Lalaji!
What a coincidence!
I was coming to see you
Your meter is ticking, Suresh
You owe me 166,000 rupees
Didn't you get the cheque?
I'll clear our accounts at Diwali
You have a week
Or else... I think you get it
Got it! You look smart today.
May I take a photo?
Say "ah"
Gran!
Rama is gifted.
She'll brighten her in-laws' home
Her brothers' quarrelling is
spoiling her chance of marriage
Damn their bickering!
Soon she'll be too old to marry
Age has nothing to do with finding love
When my beloved teases me,
sister-in-law ribs me
My husband's house is as lovely
as a marigold
When mother-in-law taunts me,
brother-in-law consoles me
My husband's house is as lovely
as a marigold
I left my parents' home
so I could belong to my beloved
My husband isa merchant.
He is leaving for the city
When I see him go, my heart sinks
My husband's house is as lovely
as a marigold
I left my parent's home
so I could belong to my beloved
Wearinga bush shirt,
he happily chews paan
There is no one to match him
in all of Raipur
My husband's house is as lovely
as a marigold
I can't swallow a thing
Eating too many betel nuts!
Who's there to stop you?
Aren't you Rama?
Wow! You've never met us.
But you recognize us
The one and only Rajjo!
How do you do? Is all well with you?
Your son is a gem
He's one of us now
We're keeping him.
Don't say we didn't warn you!
Keep him! He's yours anyway
You have a Delhi-6 heart.
Tangy and spicy! Like a Delhi snack
Mother!
Call 911!
We're going to the hospital
Irwin Hospital!
Get out of the way!
Mamdu!
She's very unwell
What's wrong? Tie this to her wrist
Lord Hanuman will cure her
We won't let her fall sick
Gobar, clear the way!
Why have they stopped?
What's going on?
Mother Cow is giving birth
Mother Cow giving baby cow
Move them out of the way. Go on!
Clear the road!
You're blessed to see
Mother Cow giving birth
Mother Cow is giving birth
Those who witness the birth
are freed of all misfortune
Here! Mother Cow has blessed you
Can prayer ever be stopped?
Mother Cow is giving birth.
People have gathered
How can the police intervene?
Step back! Everyone stand back!
Gran?
Move aside. Let us pass!
Your Gran is better already
Mother Cow's miracle!
Her sugar level had dropped
and she fainted
She's fine now
Back in America, we thought
Gran had no one in Delhi
But everyone here is family
Gran is dying, Ali Uncle
The poet Zauq says:
"Who can ever wish to leave Delhi's lanes?"
"Who can ever wish to leave Delhi's lanes?"
Just stay
Stay as you are
You are pain
You are comfort
A gentle breeze
A stormy obsession
Smooth as silk. Jagged as rough cloth
Sometimes you quarrel.
Sometimes you're stubborn
So full of fragrance
I don't want to change you an inch
Without adornment. Without impurity.
No more. No less
I love you just as you are
All yours
In your rainfall,
I want to dissolve
In your flame,
I want to burn and turn to ash
If you wound me,
soothe me with a balm
I will soon love the wound you inflict
You are a river. Let me drown in you
Your father and I had a great time
when we were young
No wife and children. A girl-friend?
Just the one
Your father took her away
My mother?
25 years ago, if I had told Fatima
"I love you"
I might have a son like you today
But dreams only blossomed
In my heart
Your father had guts
He loved her madly.
He fought everyone
Not caring what they said
about Fatima being a Muslim
He fought for love
When I look at you,
I see that love
In your eyes and in the way you talk
But then I know...
...you will leave us too
Back to America
My life is there
All my pleas are written on my face
What can I ask of You, O Master?
You already know what is in my heart
O Master! My Master
Cracks blemish the line of my destiny
Repair my fate, O Master
Repair my fate, O Master
He who comes to Your threshold
comes to bow his head
He came with throat parched.
And found an overflowing river
He returned bathed in the shower
of Your light
The rich always buy the best urns.
501. 95 paisa. Just feel it
Do you have a gold urn?
With gems and rubies
Why show off in death?
Why save if you're going forever?
A copper urn. 251.95 paisa
I want a clay urn for my ashes.
Or I'm off
You're so old-fashioned. Here you are
Especially made from sacred Ganges clay
- 151.95 paisa
- This is good
Roshan, hold it
Now I can die in peace
Here you are
Only 100?
Be happy
"The tree said to the leaf:
Listen to what I say:
"This is the cycle of life:
A leaf dies. Another is born"
I first thought it odd that Gran
was making these arrangements
A bit morbid
Who goes shopping for your
own funeral? Discussing death like this
I suppose we can't decide the manner
in which we are born
But we can plan our departure
The rainy season is over. Autumn is here
Yet I have had no word of Sita
It pains Laxman to see
His brother suffering
He longs to take away his pain
Fresh attacks in Delhi 6
The dark shadow of the Black Monkey
is cast all over Delhi
My heart stopped when I saw it.
It had bulbs on its chest
When I touched it,
I got a 500 volt shock!
Oh my God!
The earth gets its energy from the sun
But the monster Black Monkey's energy
is far greater
It can attack any time
They're all fools
The Black Monkey...
It tore her saree...
Do you want to be the next Indian Idol?
The Indian Idol bus is coming
to your town!
You pierced your navel?
Sexy, eh? I had it done yesterday
- It must have hurt
- Nothing gained without pain
If the Black Monkey has glowing lights
on its chest...
...it means it has a mother board
An electrical circuit. Right?
Leave him alone
Don't bore him with your theories
Young man! What happens when
Water enters an electrical circuit?
Right! Well done!
Hear that, Rajjo?
He's smarter than us
Made in America! Right?
So, if you see the Black Monkey's
mother board, pour water on it
Short circuit! Finished!
The end of the Black Monkey. Right?
Brilliant. It's time to leave
I'm not blowing my own trumpet.
But no one can touch me in electronics
Only father's old radio is beyond me
Until I hear a sound from it,
I won't give up
I'll see you at the prayer meeting
Good you're arranging a prayer meeting.
The Goddess will bless us
Hail to the Goddess!
Sister-in-law!
I don't know what he was telling Roshan
Something about the Black Monkey's mother
Sitting for a board exam
Pour water on it
He said pour water on it
and it's dead
But where do we get
so much water?
This chilli!
- Let Bobby play with me
- Stop it!
- What is it?
- Some sweets
Why? Has Mother Cow given birth?
No! Granny is well again. So we're
organizing a prayer meeting
I just came out of the toilet.
My handsare unwashed
Leave it inside
You're the wife of Madangopal Electrical.
How can you be so dumb?
You're from America, right?
Lightning strikes when it rains?
Yes? It does. Right?
Does lightning cause
the clouds to short-circuit?
- Never heard such a thing
- Neither have I
Throwing water on the Black Monkey
won't help
Stop that damn racket!
Do you think the Black Monkey
is a son of an ass?
A big hero!
Talking rot to the women
Uncle is right, father
My science teacher told us
about short circuits
Shut up! Son of an ass!
When you're my age, then talk big!
- Must you shout in front of Roshan?
- Mummy, I'm going out
Serve some lunch to Mrs. Mehra.
Then go to college
Pour water on the monkey? Ha!
You Americans think you own everything
You force your way everywhere.
Into any country
So shameless. You Americans
never ask for permission
What's the big deal?
It's a big deal for us.
We never cross the line
You burger species!
You know why the Black Monkey
wears shades?
- How would I know?
- It's stylish, boss!
You're smoking Indian cigarettes
when I'm around?
Try this, sir. Imported
Special filter
Is that so?
What a waste
Bobby, come here
Well, Mr Bobby? You'll get 90%
in your exams this time. Right?
No. 100%
Bravo!
Pulling your uncle's leg! Right?
Who started this round?
Ok! There's a beggar sitting
round the corner
Give this to him
That's my boy!
- What are you doing?
- I'll do what I want
Shall we go in?
- Those damn ghosts live there
- Go on!
You come too. Big mouth!
Don't be a kid. We're grown up now
- What if we're caught?
- No one enters Dead Souls' Lane
They say scary spirits roam here
Mummy says cigarettes are bad
But your father smokes
You coward!
- I'm no coward
- That's more like it!
In Delhi 6, Jalebi helps boys
become men
Jalebi? She's of a lower caste
- So what!
- I'll ask Mummy
You son of an ass! You can't ask
Mummy about everything
Now we're men
Sister! The garbage
Old letch!
You girl thief! You'll be dancing like a peacock
when I shove my broom...
The garbage!
Mrs. Mehra, the flowers
Go in
Simpleton!
Turn us into men
Who told you I could do that?
- Everyone knows
- Sonny, you still wet your pants
Still drinking milk.
You'll be men?
We're grown up. We want to be men
I'll call your mother
Be men!
Damn it!
Wretched parents!
Spoiling their children
The garbage!
In the name of Lord Ram!
Disaster!
What have you done?
Pure of body. Pure of spirit
- Take your clothes off
- You wish!
So what if Jalebi is human!
She's of a lower caste
You have to bathe. Come on
Roshan, listen to him.
Do as I say, son
Shabri, why do you hesitate?
Give me a berry to eat
She tastes the berries and offers
the sweetest to Lord Ram
Without hesitation,
Lord Ram eats berry after berry
Shabri is of a lower caste. Why is
He eating berries she has tasted?
To Lord Ram, one is inferior
or superior by birth
Ramji is God.
He is permitted everything
Rambihari
I need company. Bring Jalebi to me
The boss wants you
The key is here
Come on
You wretch! I'll fix you
- Stand up!
- I'm not going with you
Tell him that!
The police!
The Black Monkey?
Hail to the Black Monkey!
Where did the balls of the wimp go?
Who?
The Black Monkey! Who else?
Not asking about your father
Pass me the fog horn!
You Black Monkey
Your game is up.
We have surrounded the place
Be reasonable,
Or else we will shoot you
- He tore through the roof
- He must have springs for feet
You saw it?
What does it look like?
Who?
- The Black Monkey! Who else?
Why are you winding us up?
If he's invisible,
how can he be seen?
The moron drives well too!
Before I knew it...
...I was adding
to the Black Monkey's saga
Because of me, it is now invisible
In the dark of the night, wearing a dark suit
and dark glasses...
...the Black Monkey drives a black Sumo
Once its dark deeds are done...
...it presses a red button...
And becomes invisible!
It's an alien
It attacked two girls in our area.
They were sleeping
We gave chase. But it disappeared
This monkey is driving us crazy
The albatross emits many sounds
while it is mating
If you breathe deeply,
it'll benefit you in every way
Great importance is given
in Yoga to breathing
Many Sumo cars were destroyed
in Delhi
But this Sumo belonged
to the Black Monkey
- Have you seen the Black Monkey?
- Yes! It's invisible
It is an animal.
Animals aren't in our jurisdiction
Not a case for us
A monkey?
A criminal!
Hurrah! The vehicle has lifted off!
The monkey is an animal.
Not our jurisdiction!
So? Will you do nothing?
Pointing fingers at us won't help
Look at our track record
We are most capable
Utter rot!
This case is for the Animal Ministry.
They must take action
Move! Go home and watch TV
Have you ever seen an animal
with a mother board?
Springs for feet?
No! So how does it concern
the Animal Ministry?
Talk to the Science and
Technology Ministry
If they stopped lining their pockets,
they'd have time for us
How right you are!
Madangopalji! It's from the shrine
I'm Jaigopal!
For once get my name right
Look! Look into the mirror
In every speck shines His light
Look within yourself,
He isn't far from you
If you have love in you,
then embrace everyone
That's true worship
Look into the mirror!
Salaams to you!
He's a fine boy
Haji Mian!
Roshan slapped the Inspector last night
"You public servant"
"Do you know who I am?"
"You look like a public servant"
"Servant? Do I look like a servant?"
Then our Roshan, tall as...
...the Qutub Minar, swung his arm...
Did I give you permission to stop?
Carry on!
I explained. "Roshan is new in town... "
The Inspector can fix anyone
Masakali! Come
Come here, my child
Flap your wings. Fly away, Masakali!
Spread your wings and set the dust free.
Fly high! And higher still
Fly over cities, lanes and towns
Fly with grace on your wings.
Follow your heart's every desire
Blend with the wind. Stylish and swift.
Fly away, you gem
A colony of clouds is your lovely abode
Turn your head away from
those who can't fly
Fly! Do not be afraid
Do as you please. As you please
Fly away. Don't look back.
Smile as you spread your wings
Flap your wings. Fly away, Masakali!
What do you care about sorrow?
All you hear is the flute in the sky
The wind talking
The sun shining
Fly away! Never fear
Do as you please. As you please
Fly away. Don't look back
Smile as you spread your wings, Masakali
What's it to you?
Bittu! My child
I'll pour it in his tea.
Then swallow some myself
End of story
- Whose tea?
- That bloated haystack!
He wants to check me out. Marry me
Check you out?
You find us so amusing
What's wrong?
I don't want to get married.
But I don't have a choice
I'll have to walk a little.
Sing a little.
Pretend I cooked the samosas
Aunt Rama made. The perfect wife!
Hurry! Papa is about to have a fit
Yuck!
If you don't want to get married,
tell them your point of view
Who can dare talk to father?
They're made for each other.
Like Ram and Sita!
The princess arrives!
May I have a word? It's urgent
Not now. We have guests
I said later!
Do have something
Bittu doesn't want to marry him
You insolent boy!
Remember your place
She can't tell you.
Because she's scared of you
I said get out!
Bittu was going to drink rat poison.
And mix it in the tea
I am Sameer Abbas.
You're watching IBN-7
Breaking news from Delhi 6
This is what the Black Monkey looks like
The Delhi police offer a reward
of 50.000
The Black Monkey is the latest rage
No doubt about it.
That's what it looks like
Delhi is gripped by fear
People are so scared
Breaking news from Old Delhi!
In Delhi 6, pregnant woman fell
to her death as she ran down the stairs
She panicked when she heard people
say the Black Monkey was back
Fear of the Black Monkey
has caused another death
What is the Black Monkey?
Everyone in Delhi fears it
Is it some sort of plot?
Hey! The Black Monkey!
Is it inside? Or is it out?
- How are you, Gobar?
- Very well
Long live the Goddess!
Don't worry. I won't come in
Offer flowers to the Goddess from me.
My wishes will come true
No Hell for me
Sita was born to destroy
Ravan's arrogance
Praise the Goddess. Long live!
When we light the lamp in Your temple...
...our sins are washed away
You shower us with happiness
Hail to Goddess Durga!
Oh God! It's 8 o'clock
The power cut is always on time.
That's for sure
You deserve a thank you
So you're thanking me
Something like that
Did you really mean to
swallow rat poison?
You're a bit slow. It was an act.
To scare mother
When we light the lamp in Your temple...
...our sins are washed away
You shower us with happiness
That's why I'll be the next Indian Idol
The only way a middle-class girl can
become somebody from nobody
I want to do something. Be someone
Find myself
I don't want to be the Mrs. of
Daddy's chosen boy
Understand?
Enough talking!
You burger species!
My heart...
My heart...
...was lost to me
Without warning
But my eyes...
...are all-seeing
In the deep silence...
...of your flowing dark hair
Is the place...
...where my heart...
...found itself confused, lost
Mesmerized... how unaware you are
Unsuspectingly, unknowing
Why does my heart quicken?
But my eyes are all-seeing
Pearls over brimming
from the lips of oysters
Prose laced with poetry
Sheltered under a sheet of waves...
...the ocean slumbers
My eyes have been opened wide...
...by a flood of drunkenness
How unaware you are
Look! The Taj Mahal!
The Taj Mahal is a symbol to love.
Making mockery of the love of the poor
"Beloved, let us meet
in some other place"
Nice! Let's go in
Roshan!
Bittu!
Ripping us off. Taking us for tourists?
I am a local
We buy them for 95. I sell for 100
I have to earn at least 5 rupees
I can buy it for 20 in Chandni Chowk
Then buy it there, sister
Ok. Let's go
Come back!
Last price. 75.
Because you're a local
Take it. And be quiet
What colour?
For you
I said 75! And you give me 50.
Pay at least 60!
Madam, don't rob a poor shopkeeper
That's more like it
Roshan's photos of America
Let me see too!
Roshan! In America, you'll soon be
Looking at photos of us
The dawn has broken. I wait for you
My eyes are heavy.
Where did you spend the night?
How fortunate is the other woman
The dawn has broken. I wait for you
Your words are all I have
Ok
Just ok?
Bittu. Life is full of highs and lows
I've been selected
I don't know
You got what you always wanted. Right?
Her wingsare tied
She can't fly
Masakali is father's favourite.
That's why
Shall I free her?
Wasn't one slap from father
enough for you?
How dare you question your father!
I don't want to marry
Then what do you want?
I want to be an Indian Idol
What? Indian...
Sister wants to be on TV.
The song and dance show
That blasted TV!
They sent me a ticket.
I'm going to Mumbai
- Have you lost your mind?
- Get her married at once!
Nothing but bad luck
The girls in this family of ours
are so ill-fated
You only think of yourself
Oh God! Why?
What else can I do?
Spend my life stuck here like you?
I'm sorry, Aunt Rama
The stock market has opened robustly
Sharesare up. There's brisk trading
Their horoscopes don't match
Your shares are up. Do we sell?
She has bad planets
A token of good will
We're giving the boy a Honda
My boy can't be bought
for a bike
What are you saying?
You thought I meant a motorbike?
I meant a Honda car.
You choose the colour
Sell or wait?
And a Singapore honeymoon on us. Sell!
What?
I am Priyanka Sambhav and
you're watching "The Last Deal"
Panditji. Name an auspicious day
Joy abounds! A match made in heaven.
No better day then Diwali
Is it a done deal?
Done
Congratulations!
Order sweets to celebrate
Bittu's wedding is fixed
- Rajjo, see how lovely she looks
- A tip-top princess!
How time flies. Now she's of age
to marry and leave home
Keep your father's honour
The Black Monkey has struck again
It has taken 20 kgs. of milk.
12 kgs. of sweets
- How much cottage cheese?
- 15 kgs
Move it! What are you doing?
It took Hina, the poor goat
- Where were the police?
- At the police station!
How did we know it will attack?
What will you do now?
Everything is under control.
See for yourself. Talk to Mamdu
Let's talk to the shopkeeper whose
shop was attacked
Mamdu, how do you feel?
Let him talk to Mamdu!
The damn Black Monkey is in our area
And the police claim
they're controlling the situation
Today it's Hina, the goat. Tomorrow
it might our women. There's no telling
Lalaji! Do you think we're twiddling
our thumbs?
We'll take action too. Right?
Long live Shani Baba!
Shani Baba will fix everything. Ok?
Side by side? Bad omen
Really?
When?
Then?
I get it!
Shani Baba will fix everything. Ok!
How is it ok?
Look!
Lmages
Listen!
Like songs on the radio. Images on TV
They float in the air
Only one antenna can capture them
In the same way, monkeys' souls
float about in the universe
Only Shani Baba can communicate
with them
Lord Hanuman has granted
this power to Shani Baba!
- Lord Hanuman!
- May He live long!
I get it!
What? Is that the truth?
Baba will fix everything. Ok!
Three hundred and seventeen years ago...
...a temple stood here
What are you saying?
Baba will fix everything. Ok?
Acurse! Aterrible curse
Listen...
The Black Monkey is the latest Hindu plot
to humiliate us Muslims
The Black Monkey is creating mayhem.
It has wounded people
And you call it a plot?
Why does the Black Monkey only appear
from Muslim neighbourhoods?
What do you mean, Madangopalji?
Haji Mian! Why are Hindu areas
the only ones attacked?
And during the Ram Leela performances?
Hina wasa Muslim goat!
I mean she belonged to a Muslim
But everyone knows Mamdu
prays to Lord Hanuman
So wouldn't the Black Monkey know?
The Black Monkey can't be a Muslim
We have 100% proof
Has anyone ever seen
a circumcised monkey?
I have heard of people
behaving like monkeys
But a monkey being Hindu or Muslim?
This is India, my boy! Play
I want a strand of
the Black Monkey's hair
The Black Monkey's hair!
The Black Monkey's hair?
You mean pulling it off its body?
Who will do that?
We will!
Shut up!
Bring me its hair! I will destroy it!
End of the menace
End of the menace, ok!
It'll be destroyed!
Destroyed! Ok
Gobar will get the hair
Brave Gobar!
Why Gobar? Because he's an orphan?
Let the fool be of some use
He's smarter than you lot
Miss Know-All
Gobar, come here
Want one ten-rupee note?
Or two one-rupee coins?
Why one note? I'll take two coins
That's why he's the local idiot!
The day I take the ten-rupee note,
the game is all over
Look at the low caste
sniggering at us
So what if I belong to
a lower caste?
I'm better than you
When you come to me at night,
no problem touching me, eh?
But in the daytime,
I am "low caste" again!
Speak up! Is a pacifier
blocking your tongue? Bastard!
I'll put a pacifier in your mouth
What did you say?
The monkey makes you pee in your pants.
But you can hit a woman. Big man!
Balls of a wimp!
Chasing skirt all day long
Get lost!
- Brave Gobar!
- May he live long!
To get rid of an ordinary monkey...
...prayers are being offered
Illiteracy may be the reason
We will hang the monkey and burn it
The government does nothing
but chase votes
We'll kill it!
Never was there a temple here
Nor will there ever be one
Their ancestors destroyed the temple
They'll have to pay the price
All politics!
Lord Hanuman's name
is being disgraced
The monkey is a Muslim terrorist
We'll retaliate
If you're stubborn...
...you'll invite trouble. Right?
How much more can we tolerate?
Great tension in Chandni Chowk
Push rites and rituals aside
Look inside your homes
Perhaps in some dark corner
The Black Monkey lurks
See the life in these lanes
Hiding behind layers and layers
Cloaks concealing cloaks
Somewhere in the folds of the cloak
Pain is veiled. Wounds are hidden
Secrets are trampled under foot
Aware yet how unaware we are
Mad and innocent we are
Who knows the colour we're painted in
In the public bath,
we are naked. Exposed
We've no orders from above
Mamdu!
Close the door! Hurry!
Jaigopal! Damn you
Some sweets for you
You used to say:
"Mamdu's shop is my shop"
Your shop! Like hell
Your shop! Like hell
Jaigopal! You spent half your life
at my shop
Jaigopal believed my shop was his
They spent half their lives at my shop
The police are offering a reward.
50,000 to catch the Black Monkey!
Fifty-thousand?
Catch the monkey.
And give the money to Lala
- That's how much he paid for me
- My angel-face!
I'll come with an army of monkeys for you
Shashi!
The Black Monkey!
Lalalji! Save me
The Black Monkey! Save me
The Black Monkey!
Where is the Black Monkey?
Catch the Black Monkey!
You foreigner!
Is it still 8 foot? Or is it taller now?
Springs under its feet? Vanished, eh?
Into thin air?
Don't glare at me!
Lalaji's wife was almost raped.
You understand?
Tell me...
Whenever the Black Monkey attacks,
you're right there
What's going on?
- What did he say?
- Showing off his English
Look at his arrogance!
I'll sort him out
Bless you, son!
Rama...
Have a laddo. Go on!
Bittu is getting married
Rama, sweeten his mouth
They say if you bathe in the Ganges
you're blessed once
And a hundred times if you help
the family of a girl who is marrying
Why don't you just tell your father?
A father's honour is in
his daughter's hands
You're talking about your whole life
Fool? Do I look like a fool to you?
Forget it. You won't understand.
But Suresh does
I'm going to Mumbai with him
Yes! But he cares about my dreams
Is this how you'll find yourself?
I thought you'd put up a fight.
But you're running away
Am I your concern?
Do whatever you want.
You want to run from home?
Bastard! Leading my daughter astray?
Take her downstairs!
His family specializes
in eloping with girls
- Following your father's example, eh?
- Be quiet!
Mr. Fifty-Fifty!
Go, before I lose my head. Out!
What are you waiting for?
- What's wrong, Roshan?
- Nothing
Something has happened
Don't worry, son.
Leave everything to God
Which God? Whose God?
Leave it to mother's Allah?
Or Dad's Lord Ram?
Paint a stone red and it becomes a god
This plant of yours is a god too
But never solve your problems yourself.
Pray five timesa day
Ring a bell in a temple.
And leave everything to God
We want to do nothing ourselves
Don't say that. It's our faith
Whatever! But we're going back
to America
Then why did you bring me here?
Will you abandon your family in America
for these people?
My ashes will leave this place
What's going on, Gran?
I don't understand
Everything will be all right
Don't worry
This is a fight for our rights
A fight for our self-respect
A fight for our self-respect
A fight for our honour!
We'll worship Goddess Durga here!
We'll build a temple
Say it loud and clear!
We will build a temple here
Fight in the name of God
They're provoking us
We die. Or they die
Sorry, Annapurnaji
He isn't allowed inside the temple
Meaning?
Blood is blood after all
- Let it go
- This temple doesn't belong to you
Does it belong to your father?
You Muslim!
Anyone who challenges us will be
destroyed!
You're better off listening to your elders
This is no party. Too much tension here
Granny! Make him see some sense
He doesn't get it
Have you ever wondered...
...what this good soul...
...whom you call a madman
is trying to say?
What can a mad fakir say?
Why don't you go ahead and tell us?
"In every speck shines His divine light
"Look within yourself.
He isn't far from you"
He says everyone has
God's light within him
A speck of Him
If we look within...
...we will find Him
Have you ever heard that
God hates anyone?
I haven't
The boy has acquired a taste
for preaching. Listen to him!
Have a look
Look! Madangopalji
God is within us all
Stop this nonsense!
Allah is the only God
Look in the mirror, Mamdu
Can you see your God?
Roshan says God is in everyone.
In Gobar and this deaf-mute
Garland him! Worship him!
Now watch me!
I'm looking into the mirror
So that means I'm god too!
And I created the world.
I created the world!
Damn it! The world is broken.
Into pieces!
They've turned into animals
The devil is perched on their shoulders.
They care for no one
And feel no shame
Why did you...
...visit the temple now?
Why did Roshan behave so stubbornly?
We're unworthy
They showed their true colours
Delhi folk talk of being large-hearted. Ha!
I don't feel like dying here now
Roshan. Take me back to America
I was leaving...
Father, I'm leaving home
I was leaving. Leaving
this madness behind me.
I don't know what I want.
But I know what I don't want
Away from Bittu
And perhaps away from myself
But I don't know why I wanted to stay
And embrace this madness.
Be part of it
Something was stopping me from leaving
First Gran didn't want to go.
Now I don't want to go
You don't want to go?
Or never want to go?
I never want to go
Despite what happened yesterday?
Because of yesterday
"This is a love that isn't easy.
Remember that!"
We lack food. So we get by with love
Our homes are small.
So we swear by large-heartedness
A flute sound floats through the tap.
Not water
You will regret it. Stay far away
How can I?
These are my people
Their virtues and goodness are mine
Their flaws are mine too
You're over-emotional, Roshan
People are good
My parents never admit it,
but they miss their life here
They try to recreate this world
in America
But when they open the window,
unfamiliar air blows in
Deep thinking!
Can I tell you something?
This house once belonged to Fatima
Your mother grew up here
Before leaving, her family wanted to
sell the house. I bought it
Don't tell me
Tell Bittu you love her
Or you'll end up
buying empty houses like me
Let your feelings out.
Must they burn inside you?
This is Delhi-6. Penal Code 144
has been imposed
This is the shrine where
the trouble started
Curfew has been imposed.
Is this the lull before the storm?
Weapons were found behind this tree
Risking my own life, Kumar Kulshreshtha,
is reporting to you...
Who gave you permission?
Here's the capable officer-in-charge,
Ram Vijayji!
Uncle! Get the name right.
Thakur Ranvijay!
If we had officers like you
in every neighbourhood...
It's my duty
Duty is duty. Duty is first come
Bring me a strand of
the Black Monkey's hair
Don't be scared.
You are serving all mankind
Do as you are told.
Get the Black Monkey's hair!
Don't you understand?
Well done! Keep moving
I wish I had your guts
Here's some money
Go. Your dreams are waiting for you
Roshan, Suresh is at the shrine
You oaf!
- What are you doing here?
- I have a lot of work, sir
- Sorry, sir. I'm going home
- Move it! Pissing in my ear!
Bittu has left home
Suresh is heading to
Dark Souls' Lane
What will happen now?
Let the final battle begin!
Good will win over Evil today
Today is the day of the great battle
Today is the day of the great battle
Hail Lord Ram!
We call upon the Great Allah
Balls of a wimp! Look up there!
The Black Monkey!
Get him! The witch's son
Play cricket later. Catch the monkey!
If you see the Black Monkey,
throw water on it
Throw water!
Shani Baba! Go! Or else
the Black Monkey will get you
Get the water! Balls of a wimp!
The Black Monkey's hair
No harm in making fools of fools
The Black Monkey is on our roof
I saw its shadow
Bhisham!
Rajjo!
The Black Monkey threw
Bhisham off the terrace
Where is he hurt?
Calls himself a father.
Can't look after his own son
Left him to the mercy of
the Black Monkey
Mother Goddess! Save my nephew
Don't lie. We all have to go to God
Leaving our riches behind
O Lord Hanuman! Keep me safe
O Protector of Lord Ram, save me
Lalaji!
Actually, the Black Monkey...
...is at the heart of the whole problem
You're absolutely right, Haji Mian
One minute. I'll come with you
The Black Monkey isn't far
I told you to throw water on it
Make him see sense!
I warned you!
Everything will be all right
To save face in the community...
...we'll say the Black Monkey
kidnapped Bittu
It will shut them up. Right?
Bittu! Where are you?
You sure you have the tickets?
I checked them four times
I landed in trouble.
I had to slap the Inspector
Stop bragging! Let's go
What is it? Hurry!
Suresh!
You!
What have you done? Why did you
need to do this? I had almost escaped
He ran and left you
at the Black Monkey's mercy
You're leaving me too. For America
I'm incomplete without you
I thought you'd never say it
Balls of wimp! You've been
messing us around for days
He isn't the Black Monkey
Teach him a lesson!
- Let him go!
- Stop!
He's no Black Monkey
I have the monkey's hair
Stop it!
I have the monkey's hair!
Look! The hair
- Father, stop them!
- Shut up!
Jaigopal! Beat him to a pulp!
Creating nothing but trouble
The Black Monkey
You can't be the Black Monkey
just by wearing a two-penny suit
Destroy it!
Shani Baba will fix everything, ok!
The Black Monkey
Roshan
You killed him?
Bravo!
You would've killed each other if
he hadn't posed as the Black Monkey
The Black Monkey is laughing at us
It isn't dead
It is sitting inside us
In some dark corner
In every one of us
Laughing at us
The Black Monkey killed Roshan
He pretended to be the monkey
out of love for us
Out of love for Bittu
Call an ambulance!
Mamdu is just like his father.
Too much sugar in his sweets
Grandad! Why bother
how sweet sweets are?
We Delhi folk didn't treat you right
They're good-hearted people, Granddad
The devil is perched on their shoulders
Not the devil. A monkey
My Black Monkey stayed within me
If only I could apologize to your mother
Do it now
Call her!
Cracks blemish the line of my destiny
Repair my fate, O Master
I bow at Your door.
My being erased andthen remade
Repair my fate, O Master
Start driving!
What's wrong?
The injection!
He's gone
Help him! Do something
We'll meet again
Roshan has gained consciousness
As poet Zauq says: "Who can ever
wish to leave Delhi's lanes?"
Gobar was so right
The Black Monkey or something like it
is within all of us
Whenever there is anger and hatred,
the monkey becomes more powerful
And we use it to our advantage
But instead of destroying the Black
Monkey within us, we kill each other
The Black Monkey turned to ashes
like the demon Ravan
As for me, this is home.
And mine is a story of home-coming
