His name is Martin McGartland...
and when I met him, he was an unemployed
Catholic hood selling stolen goods.
Now, these are a guarantee for action,
all for a couple of quid, like?
- Take yourself off.
- Well, would you have a dollar?
See, now, I had you down for
something a wee bit silky...
- Oh, not again.
- Oh, come on, it's sexy...
Martin helped support his family.
I liked that about him.
- We don't want any!
- Wait, don't go!
Have any Hugo Boss?
- Only the entire line at my fingertips.
- All right.
No, there's no way, man.
No way.
Please?
Okay, I'll do you nine
if you take the Hugo Boss for 10.
Done. Do you want
to have a look, Lara?
You know I'm not.
Oh, thank God there's you and
the Pope looking after our souls.
You seem to be under the wrong impression.
These goods are not stolen.
They're... manufacturer overruns.
How about some shoes, Mrs. Flaherty?
Like, I've got loads of shoes.
I can get you any shoes you like.
Anything from this catalogue here.
There's no point in me looking, love.
Not that I care where it comes from.
Well, maybe next month.
Okay, well...
- Here, Mummy, can I have another tenner?
- No, you cannot.
Oh, please?
What did you do with that 20
I last gave you? What did you do?
I don't know.
It just adds up.
So if there's anything you need...
Jobs were generally controlled by
the Protestants, which meant...
most of the young Catholic men were
unemployed, and angry about it.
Martin and Sean have lived
on the edge for so long...
they didn't know any other way.
No way, man.
Who'd you kill for this, you wanker?
1800, twin cam,
and up to 60 in seven seconds.
Outrun any peeler in the city.
The boot's a wee bit small, but it'll do.
I can get you a deal anytime.
It's no use.
I can't afford the petrol.
And that's where I come in.
I was a peeler. That's what
they call the police in Belfast.
I was a Handler with the Special Branch.
My codename was Fergus.
You see, by 1988, Belfast had been
a battleground for 20 years.
The Irish Republican Army against
Unionist Ulster Defense Force.
Both were illegal armies.
It was about freedom.
Police barricaded all
roads leading to...
Unionists want Northern Ireland
to stay as part of the United Kingdom.
Catholic Republicans want
free of British rule.
Both sides were willing to kill
for their cause.
By 1969, violence was so bad British
troops were sent to keep the peace.
They've been there ever since.
To the IRA, they were also
an occupying army.
B- 20. We have a report
of sniper fire.
- Thanks, love.
- Two officers down.
Send available blue lights
to Falls Road area.
This is B-20, out.
Is everybody all right?
- Outcome?
- Result.
Six shots fired. Two officers down.
Two casualties. I repeat...
Go on, you mad bastard.
Tell the boys to pull out.
Six shots fired, two officers down,
two casualties.
I repeat, two officers down.
Send blue lights. Over.
K- 9 response to Falls Road.
Six shots fired.
Trying to locate gunman.
Looks IRA.
We had real respect
for the IRA as a military force.
We sealed the communities.
Protestants one side of the wall,
Catholics on the other.
The reality was we couldn't stop
what was happening...
because we didn't have the minds
of the people.
In war, truth is the first casualty, and
information is as powerful as bullets.
Growing up an Irish Catholic lad in
a Republican community...
where police and security forces were
not trusted, Martin had few choices.
What are you talking about? You've
never done a day's work in your life...
But he was his own man, and that meant
he had real potential to work with us.
I really don't think stealing cars
is what you would call employment.
- You know what I mean?
- It depends on how you look at it.
If the peelers catch you this time,
that's it, man. You're fucked.
Sean, tell me you didn't
steal that car.
I didn't steal that car.
I knew someone like him could make
a real difference.
All I had to do was convince him.
Where you off to, lads?
Aye, we're just going to the shops,
you know.
- All right. Name?
- Mickey Mouse.
- Mickey, what street are you from?
- Sesame Street.
No, it's Disneyland. Mickey Mouse
is Disneyland.
Aye, right, Disneyland, eh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are you going?
Didn't you hear him, man? We're, like
we're just going to the shops a second.
Me sister's birthday's coming up. We're
getting her a present. Is that okay?
- Just a wee bike, aye?
- Name!
You fucking hard of hearing?
Mickey Mouse.
What are you doing? What, are you
going to shoot him, is that it?
Oh, now you're going to shoot me?
First you, and now it's me?
Go ahead, man.
Shoot.
Go on, man, fire away.
Fucking shoot me, man.
Is someone going to do something
about this psycho here?
It's all right.
Put it down.
Wait! After them, lads!
Come on, move it!
Peelers!
This way, let's go!
Fuck!
Come on!
After doing 90 on the Shankill,
your mate Sean spun out...
took off before the officers
chasing him could say "wanker."
I gather you're in sales.
A bloke like you
gets around the area.
Not me, man. I make
it a point to see nothing.
How about easy cash...
the kind that doesn't see you going
to jail for selling stolen goods?
I show you some faces, you tell us
what you see them doing.
What makes you think that
I would be a tout for anybody?
The comings and goings of neighbours
is not exactly being an informer...
or a "tout,"as you call it.
A car. No record.
Not even on police files yet.
Martin didn't go for any of our usual
offers or threats.
He sold stolen goods in Catholic areas
against strict IRA rules...
which were brutally enforced.
Are we done?
Can I go now, please?
That meant he wasn't afraid of them.
All right.
Thank you very much.
Which is why I also knew
I could trust him.
Well?
I'll take him out on a road test.
If he's useless, I'll give him to Ml5,
tell them he's bloody brilliant.
Jeez, Paddy. You watching
your family videos again?
Ray here came by to make
your acquaintance.
Marty's been working for me.
Like I say, he's a good lad.
- Is he?
- Fuck this.
Didn't have anything on you, did they?
Here you go, Paddy.
Oh, Jesus.
How you doing, Ray?
So, Martin, Sean here says
you're a good man.
Look, man, I didn't see nothing.
That's true, you didn't,
and you'll do well to remember that.
I know your ma.
She's a good woman.
- Thanks for what you did today.
- Aye, no problem.
We'll not forget it.
Aye.
Sean, man, how do you know him?
He's IRA.
- Is he now?
- Yeah, he is.
Where's me money?
Paddy, is there any chance of getting
a pair of these, like, in black?
Size eight?
Please, God, no, it's a pipe. It's just
a pipe! The bathroom's just upstairs.
Do I look like I shot anybody?
What reason could you have
to search my house for guns?
- I live here, okay?
- Two officers have just been shot.
What else do I need know?
Where were you two hours ago?
I was playing football, man.
Where were you?
- Bullshit!
- Don't! Don't!
I didn't raise you to be thick
as a plank!
Listen. If I find out you were
anywhere near this trouble...
I'll drag you to the police myself!
But I had nothing to do with it!
Evil can only do its work if decent
ordinary people turn a blind eye...
- even if only for a moment.
- Keep searching!
He's made an impression on the IRA,
for sure, right up the line.
From here on, I'm out.
Can't figure out what you'd want
with a 10p hood like him.
What's this? Huh?
What's this?
What, you were heading round your Ma's
house and doing a wee bit of fixing?
Wouldn't be for stealing cars,
would it? Not our Frankie.
Breaking into people's houses?
Yeah? Yeah?
Joyriding their cars?
Now I'm hearing about drugs?
These are crimes against the community,
and you've been found guilty.
It's not me. I swear.
What?
Help, help!
Fuck!
What the...
Fucking shit, is that it?
Well, you're one lucky fucker, Frankie.
If I'd have brought my.097, your
football career would've been done for.
You want this lying down
or standing up?
- Standing.
- Right.
No! Fucking leave him!
Leave him!
- My jeans!
- Fuck your jeans.
The peelers mightn't give a shit
about our community...
and how you wankers like you who fuck
it up for everyone, but we do, so...
thank God for the IRA.
Fucking bastard!
Frankie! That's my brother!
That's my wee brother!
Frankie!
Funny coincidence running
into you, huh?
Frankie! Frankie...
That's for getting involved
in something that doesn't concern you.
I'm assuming you have no plans
for this evening...
because there's somebody
who wants to meet you.
Fucking bastards!
Fred, Fred?
Do you know that kid, Martin McGartland?
Well, I've taken a special interest.
Goddamn it. That's been less
than 10 minutes.
Who told you about the meeting
going down with Mickey Johnson?
Just lose the file.
- And not a word to anyone, right?
- Yeah, right.
Jesus Christ.
Sorry about the drama.
You've got to be careful.
Would you get us some ice and
a tea towel there, love?
I hear the Brits took your ma's
house apart.
No warrant, no cause, picked you up
for questioning.
Dogs have more rights.
Here. Thanks, love. Away and make
yourself a wee cup of tea there.
I can see you don't partake
in loose talk...
or I'd be behind bars now.
Seems to me like we're
on the same side.
You're a go-getter.
I've been asking around.
A kid like you deserves
to work at something, build a future.
Do you know why you can't get a job?
Because it makes you easier to beat.
The Brits underestimate us.
This war is being fought in our
own footpaths, in our gardens...
in our living rooms.
Makes for a special kind of man who's
defending his home and his community.
I am thinking...
maybe you'd want to be part of something
that's bigger than your skinny wee arse.
It's bigger than mine.
It's as big as a country.
Well, do you want the job?
Okay.
Paddy's nothing but a wheeler-dealer.
That's a sure way of getting
your legs broken.
A fence is just a tout in training,
so you're finished with him.
Okay?
You got a car?
Aye, I do.
Mickey Johnson ran a taxi
company.
He was also high up in the IRA, and
drivers were a perfect way to recruit.
I knew Martin would be pissed off by
the IRA for taking out Frankie's knees.
Maybe he'd see Mickey's job
as an opportunity to get a car...
and to help us.
That was my hook.
In my world, timing is everything
and occasionally, we get lucky.
I've been asking around for you.
I'm glad you're okay.
I'm fine, no problem.
Come here, Frankie, I'll get you in.
You okay?
Are you okay, man?
Look at me, Frankie.
I'm sorry, mate, you know?
I wish I could have helped you, man.
There was nothing I could have done.
Okay?
Frankie's got an appointment
at the Royal.
Bloody taxis. We're very late.
I'm sure we've completely missed
his doctor...
and next week he goes
on Tuesday and Thursday.
Maybe I can give you a lift, like.
I understand.
- You got a car?
- Aye, definitely. Yeah.
That'd be brilliant, wouldn't it,
Frankie?
Tuesday would be grand.
I'll pick you up on Tuesday, okay?
- 4:00?
- Aye, definitely.
There's a right way and a wrong way
to do this. He's not in our pocket yet.
Pick him up. Let's see
what he's made of.
Worst case, he ends up another
statistic in jail or the morgue.
I don't see a downside.
Aye, he doesn't listen to anybody.
That's his problem.
- That's why he...
- Wanker.
What did you say?
- Would you take him off.
- Come here, love. Come here.
What did you say, man?
- Don't be starting anything, Marty...
- Did you say something to me?
Marty, just walk away.
Move on. Okay, move on.
Good man.
Okay, why would you do that?
Why would you do that?
You're going to point that at me now?
Why would you do that?
What are you sick? Is that it?
- Hey, get off!
- Is that it? Is that it?
And with a wee baby about!
With a baby about!
Against the wall, laddy.
- Ma!
- Marty!
- Fuck off.
- I'm his mother!
Ma! I swear to God
I didn't do it!
He's assaulted an officer and
now he's got to go to the station.
Idiots were supposed to pick you up.
They weren't supposed to start a riot.
What the hell's going on?
Are you setting me up?
A desperate man goes to
desperate measures.
I'm Fergus.
That's a terrible thing happened
to your mate, Frankie.
I'm sure the sister, Lara, forgot to
tell you her mother got the shoes.
Thinks you're a rock star.
Hopefully, I've impressed you with
our thoroughness because...
I need your help.
You met with Mickey Johnson.
Never seen him.
This is about lives and saving them.
They'll do to you what they did to
Frankie, only worse.
They're terrorists, killers who've
found a cause to kill for.
Terrorists?
Is that what you think, huh?
Terrorists?
Well, I don't see anyone tearing up
your house because you're Irish...
hauling your arse onto the street...
getting the shit kicked
out of you by soldiers for fun?
The Brits have never been in Ireland by
invitation, so who's the terrorist?
I'm offering a job you
can feel good about.
They'll offer you a job
that'll likely get you killed.
It's harder to live for
your country than die for it.
A car's expensive.
My gift to you. No strings.
You see...
I'm betting murder isn't in you.
Memorize this number, then
flush the card. Call me anytime.
Tell them your name is John Brown,
ask for Fergus. They'll find me.
How do I know that's not
bugged or something?
Well, why would we bother?
One phone call,
I know where you are.
You want to give me money
and a car for nothing?
That's fine by me.
- Hop along, Frankie.
- Give me those.
- How'd you afford a set of wheels?
- Because I got a job.
You did? You got a real job?
Aye, yeah, it's a real job.
I'm a taxi driver.
- Where's your license?
- Oh, you need a license now, do you?
I thought we were in Belfast,
you wee shit.
This is brilliant.
Look, don't mind our Frankie.
Ah, he's fine.
Listen, I was just wondering if
maybe I could take you out?
You know, maybe see a film,
or some dinner, or something?
- Sure. Dinner?
- Okay. Go on, then.
Look, I think I'm free on Thursday.
Is that okay?
- Okay. You're on.
- Okay.
Frankie, don't mind him.
He's got a real job, you know.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
- So where are we going, anyway?
- The Europa Hotel, man.
I need you to pick my daughter up for
school in the morning. Is that okay?
Aye, no problem.
- Nice shirt.
- What, this?
I can pick one up for you,
if you like.
Come on, it's not like that.
- So, how do you like driving a taxi?
- It beats working for Paddy.
- No complaints about the hours?
- No, no, I like it.
You're one of my best drivers.
You're reliable, and that counts
for everything in life.
You know who you remind me of?
I don't remind you of anybody
because I'm not like anybody else.
My ma always said I'm like
one in a million.
A million. That's what my
ma always told me I was.
Aye, you're full of shit.
- Who do I remind you of?
- Wee Aggie.
Who's Aggie?
I wouldn't trust him with my wife,
but I trust him with my life.
I've got a bloody spring in me arse.
No wonder your aunt gave you
this shitbox for free.
Up yours, man.
I tell you what, I could have
got you a deal on a real car.
What, and end up with the peelers
on my tail, man? No thank you.
You're a tube.
- There he is.
- Here he comes.
Sean, where are you going, man?
You'll catch up with Sean later.
If God is good, and we're lucky.
We're going for a spin.
Follow that car.
It's a nice day.
Go north to the M5.
Head for Lorne.
Look, man, I'm sorry, but
I was pretty much finished my shift.
- I got a big, big night coming up.
- You'll be finished when I am finished.
Fine. I'll just keep
my mouth shut then, will I?
Turn left into that parking lot
there and park.
Aye.
Just over there.
You stay here.
I'll look and be right back.
And then you can get
on with your big night.
Now, is there a problem?
- No problem.
- Good.
Good enough.
Let's go.
Hello, yeah. Could I speak
to Fergus, please?
My name? John.
John Brown.
So whatever you want to do.
Like, just wear something slinky.
It's a really fancy place.
I'll pick you up at 8:00, okay?
All right, speak soon. I'll be there
at 8:00. All right, bye-bye.
Sounds like Marty's got a date.
I do, I do, but I'm sorry, Ray,
you know, you're just not invited.
Listen...
take her...
take her somewhere nice. Yeah?
Oh, my God, it's on fire!
Is it meant to do that?
It's the chef's signature dish.
Of course.
It looks smashing.
Aye, it does. It really does.
My pleasure.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- So you never answered my question.
- What question was that?
Don't duck it.
You have an opinion.
I'm not ducking. I'm not.
I don't have an opinion.
You're Irish, aren't you?
You were born with an opinion.
What are you thinking?
I was thinking whether your ma liked
them shoes that I got her.
That's what I was thinking.
Yes. She practically slept
with them on.
- Did she?
- You achieved sainthood.
So?
Look, how did we get from me being
thrown out of school...
to suddenly my belief
in God, anyway?
Like, I want to know about you, like.
Like, what's your favourite band?
Okay, I'm not saying I don't believe
in God. Like, I do believe in God...
but He's probably not a Catholic God.
Right, I don't think God's
sitting on a cloud...
trying to figure out whether
He's Protestant, or Catholic...
or fucking Buddhist either.
Everyone's got these big opinions
about how you should live...
and who you should love.
The government, the peelers, the
Catholics, the Protestants, the Brits.
Any of them is full of it if they
think that they know more about you...
or that they know more about me
or of God than anybody else.
It seems to me they're more interested
in killing than living anyway...
which, I mean, is hard enough to do and
then keep up with the everyday shit.
Morrissey, Guns 'n Roses,
the Pogues, and U2, of course.
Jimmy Page is probably one of
the finest guitar players alive...
and Prince is great for having sex.
Where are we, anyway?
We're in Lorne.
You know, someone told me about
this pub.
Do you want to check it out?
What's going on there?
- Do you know him?
- Don't know him. Don't know him.
Get back.
You get out of here.
Come on, move it. Move it.
Okay. We're moving!
Move it back now!
I ever tell you I wanted to go
to Disney World before I die?
Aye, you don't stop going on about
it, you and Minnie Mouse.
Tell you what, give us a lift home.
I always give you a lift.
You rode Lara, didn't you?
You keep track of her period, or
else you'll be shopping for nappies.
Good man.
What, I'm taking advice from
the model da now, is that it?
My kids are beautiful.
Besides, being a da's not easy.
It's got its responsibilities and...
Fuck me. How you doing?
That's a nice bum.
What are you sucking on today?
It's one for our side.
Look...
you got to expect a bit of killing
and a bit of dying in a revolution.
That's the way things work.
Besides, you're not a man unless
you've got a cause.
Give us a lift.
Two soldiers died, two more
are critical.
Look, I didn't see anything.
Why are you working for them?
I'm not working for them like that.
I've been driving Mickey around, they
asked me to pick up Quinn, so I did.
- And they trust you?
- Like I said, it's not like that.
Why?
Well, you called me.
Why? What's different?
Everything.
Everything.
You can move on the inside.
Dead men will be walking around and
becoming grandfathers because of you.
That's my community.
Like, I know some of these people.
Memorize this.
Here's your petrol money.
- Thanks for the tea.
- Anytime.
Fuck! Stop him!
Hold it!
- Don't you fucking move!
- All right, don't shoot!
Okay, lads! Make sure you're at the
Upland place by 12:00 noon tomorrow.
Mickey, you take the back roads,
dump the cars there and split.
Johnny will look after things here...
and lads, make sure no one sees you.
Okay, let's go!
- It's an odds thing.
- What is?
If the peelers get one of the cars...
the other two are more likely
to get through if we're in a pack.
Besides, with a cargo like this,
it keeps us all honest.
Shit.
Sean, what are you doing, man?
Put that away.
I'm serious, put it away.
Put it away.
If this thing blows,
I'll be Jesse Fucking James.
Sean, you put that away, man.
Fucking put it away.
Put it away.
- That's quite a car.
- Yeah, it's my da's.
Where are you off to today, son?
We're just, uh, picking him up
at the airport, like.
You're a long way out of your way.
Well, we had to go to my sister's.
Like, she's moving, so...
we're just on our way back round.
- Can I see your license, please?
- Aye, then.
I told my da to keep it in there.
I think he must have forgot.
May I take a look in the boot, please?
Aye, no problem.
You know what's happened?
This is a spare set of keys.
My da's got the main set.
It's not going to work the boot.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
If I give you a number...
maybe you can speak to my sister.
Have you got a pen?
I can write it down for you.
My da'll beat my arse if I'm late,
you know what I mean?
If you could just tell him that you're
calling about Martin McGartland. Okay?
Here, mate.
She says she has your keys.
Okay.
Thank you.
That's great, thank you.
They got nothing on us, they don't.
So who the fuck's your sister?
It was my ma.
Fucking, my ma!
Your ma? Bloody hell.
Me ma would have let them have me.
Good work, man.
Bloody hell...
An RUC patrol calling me like
I was your sister?
Hey, come on, I was brilliant.
Stupid risks cost lives,
including yours.
So you're my da now?
Just get the guns.
Today in Belfast, residents
of a middle class...
Detectives said it was highly
significant...
and certainly it was curious.
The weapons ranging
from old hunting rifles...
A haul of nearly 100 guns
including Kalashnikov rifles...
has been discovered by police
in the boots of two cars...
Three men have been arrested, believed
to have connections with the IRA...
Come on, let's go.
- Who is that?
- He's a target.
And what are you asking
questions for?
Listen, Marty, it could just
as easily be him...
scouting you and your family.
Go.
It's the Protestant church
near North Road.
Our target's got three wee girls.
What else?
Look, this guy's got a family as well.
He's just doing his job, you know?
Okay, Ray O'Brien is the shooter.
That's it.
What about Sean?
I don't know nothing about Sean.
I told you that.
You don't get to pick and choose.
This is all in.
Because I finger you, you're dead.
You finger me, I'm dead, so...
there we are.
I want to show you something.
He has a kid. A ma, a da.
- Is he a tout?
- A tout?
He saved at least 30 lives, probably
more. He's a goddamned hero.
Your mates tortured him for seven days,
168 hours until we found him.
Sean doesn't get arrested.
A 400-pound bomb was your mate's
latest gift to the city of Belfast.
Seven people died, and
you don't want him arrested?
He's my mate. He's got two kids
from two different women...
Aw, give me a hankie.
No way. I can't do it.
There's no deal. No way.
Then there's no deal.
What if I give you every detail
of every move he makes?
You can shut him down, like.
Come on, I'm into saving my mates
as much as yours.
Look at him.
Can't you just look at him?
It's a dirty war, and everyone seems
to think the end justifies the means...
which is why you and your mate
are even walking around.
How do you know I can do it?
You've got no choice.
Neither have I.
I'm not looking for a da.
Just...
don't get yourself killed.
How's it going?
- How you doing?
- Yeah, not bad.
It's cold out, isn't it?
- Aye. That time of year, isn't it?
- Aye, definitely.
- Is this all your gang, is it?
- Yeah.
- Hi. What's your name?
- Jane.
Jane, is it? Hello, Jane.
I like your jacket, Jane.
- And what's your name?
- Catherine.
Catherine, and what about you?
You ready?
You're cheeky, you are, aren't you?
- See you later.
- Anyway, take it easy. Have a good one.
Martin...
- What?
- I'm pregnant.
Are you sure?
I did a home pregnancy test and
at the hospital. Yeah, I'm sure.
That's something, isn't it?
That's brilliant, then.
That's fantastic.
Really?
Come on, what did you think
I was going to say?
I don't know.
- What about my ma?
- Oh, shit, your ma.
Shit, my ma.
Marty?
I have the washing,
but I can't find that blue shirt.
What were you doing with the blue...
Lara, love, you can come out now.
Look, the two of you are adults,
but if you get yourself pregnant...
well, don't go expecting your
parents to treat you any different.
Oh, my. Well, then, I guess
a congratulations is in order.
Your father wasn't much of a man
to look to, but you're not him.
You'll do the right thing,
or I'll kill you myself.
Ma, for Christ's sake.
Well, I'll leave you to make a plan.
- Sorry.
- There's lots to think about.
Oh, shit...
I was so worried.
Me too.
You okay?
I'm not going to piss off like
my own da, man.
I'm going to stick around...
give the kid a wee bit of advice
here and there, you know?
So it's going down on Friday.
You going to be ready?
I'll be ready. You're worse
than my own ma.
I just don't want you
to embarrass me is all.
You wouldn't embarrass me,
now, would you?
Wanker.
So, lover boy,
what are you going to do...
when Lara's ma finds out that
you knocked up her daughter?
Don't you worry about that one.
There's no way we're shacking up.
I've got it.
- Who is it?
- I don't know. I'm just getting it.
I've nowhere else to go.
My mummy, she found out.
Jeez, look.
We can't live here, really.
You want to shack up?
Aye. Aye, definitely.
Come here.
We'll be all right,
right, baby?
Marty McGartland, you're
full of surprises.
Aye, I know.
Now, come on, get inside.
I've got school every day, so, like...
Hey, hey, listen, you don't have
to worry about that.
I'm fully employed. You know that?
You know that?
I love you.
Me too.
Okay, look, at the Portsmouth ferry...
there's a boatload of soldiers going
to England, right, on the 18th.
Now, they're going to hit the vans
waiting in the queue.
I guess too many civilians for the boat
itself makes for bad press, you know?
Now, I know they got a shitload
of Semtex.
They've got a load of weapons,
make sure this really goes off.
- You know what Mickey said to me?
- What?
He said he was so pleased with
the Upland operation...
that he's bumping me up
to B Battalion.
- Yes!
- I thought you'd like that.
- I like that.
- Yeah, I thought you would.
- You know what else he said?
- What?
- He's sending me to meet McFarlane.
- Oh, come on, it's bloody brilliant.
That's bloody brilliant.
I'm here to prepare volunteers, in case
you get interrogated by the police.
They'll come in banging in the middle
of the night, screaming to confuse you.
Press this button to get directly
through to me.
Punch in a number, I'll call you.
Okay.
Appliance of science, that's brilliant.
I like that. Very James Bond.
Ask the Duty Sergeant to see the doctor,
before they beat you.
The harder they hit,
the harder you hit back.
Curl up in a ball and protect
your head. You'll need it.
Unless, of course, they cuff you,
in which case you're fucked.
Aye, I know what I'm doing.
- Oh, yeah?
- Aye.
Do you know they'll hold your head
under water till your eyes are spinning?
Again and again, for a couple of hours.
If they won't let you
go to the toilet...
you strip right down in front
of them and take a shit.
They'll squeeze your balls with
a pair of pliers.
They'll twist your thumbs
out of their sockets.
Okay, man, like, I get it.
You say one thing, they'll
have you for seven years.
You'll say whatever they want
to hear to make it stop.
Think. Outsmart them, but never
underestimate them.
You admit to anything, you'll end up in
a ditch with a cattle prod up your arse.
My car's marked, right?
You bugged my place.
I've got this wee buzzer here.
Look, there's someone on my tail
24 hours a day.
Yeah, but it doesn't mean
I don't worry.
I would get up there
if you'd get up there...
but there's no way
I'm going on my own. No way.
The bloody British. They found
out about the Portsmouth operation.
No shit.
So, ladies, what
are we celebrating on?
- We just passed our exams, we did.
- Aye, this one got here two As.
- And a B.
- Two As and a B.
- Well, cheers to that.
- Cheers.
Don't you worry about this, all right?
I'll go get the next round.
Give us a hand, eh, Marty?
- Sean, I don't drink.
- Give us a hand.
- I know you're not.
- Excuse me, ladies.
Two lagers, please.
There's a fucking leak.
They got everything.
Bloody waste of Semtex, it was.
Brit blood would've spilled.
Aye, Jesus Christ, what a waste.
If we didn't have bad luck,
we'd have no fucking luck at all.
Fucking peelers, man.
Peeler, yeah.
It's times like this, you know,
it makes you think about your family...
and puts it all into perspective.
I want to see
my damn kids, you know.
Anyway...
- What's with him?
- He's just drunk.
- Feel that?
- Did it kick?
- Is it kicking?
- It's a ballerina in there.
- That is a footballer, I'm telling you.
- It's a ballerina.
It's a footballer.
Let's go home and have
a fight about it.
Okay, let's fight on it.
Did you know, pregnant girls
are extra horny?
- Let's definitely go home, then.
- Let's go.
You're making me and the whole
department look really brilliant.
Mickey wouldn't let me dodge
this meeting.
The head of security's going to be
there.
- You don't think they're onto me?
- No, they're going to test you.
Do whatever they ask.
If they suspect you're not 100%
you'll be out or dead, and, well...
we have no one moving
up the inside like you.
Aye. Okay.
I'll meet you at 5:00
the usual place. Good luck.
Cut him down.
