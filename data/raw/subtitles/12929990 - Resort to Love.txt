Hey, New York, what's good?
It's your boy DJ Teddy P, and listen,
I'm hearin' some things.
I'm hearin' that there might be
a super-exclusive listening party
for the new Cre album tonight.
Now, I don't know when or where it is,
but if it's Cre, you know it'll be hot.
So if his people don't call me soon
with the invite,
I might have to leak this track
that just got sent to me.
You already know what time it is.
Yo, Cre! Hit me up! Ha-ha!
Yes!
Fabulous!
Okay, these two pair of lashes
are weighing down my lids.
Shh. Okay. Now, tilt to the side.
- Okay.
- Yes.
- Now sultry, but with a holding.
- Okay.
Yes. Yes!
- Okay, we're done. I got it.
- Okay. We good?
This is a perfect
last-Countdown-to-Epic-Music post.
Oh my gosh, I'm so nervous.
My hands are shaking.
Erica, when has anyone ever not liked
a Cre album?
I know.
The man is a musical genius,
which is why he picked you
to sing on these tracks.
- After tonight's listening party...
- Yes.
...and the release of his album,
your life will never be the same.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Yes, and I cannot wait for you to hear it.
Because, girl...  ...I killed it.
Of course, you did! Now grab your purse.
Oh, wait. Oh, is that a snag?
Amber!
No!
You really don't have
anything else to wear.
I put everything in storage
when I came to crash with you.
Why isn't this in storage?
- Just leave it.
- No.
No, seriously, come on, girl. Put it back.
- We can make this work.
- You're not cutting up my wedding dress.
Okay, you are never going to wear this.
And Jason is never coming back.
So, really, we're just making lemonade out
of relationship trauma lemons.
What's it gonna be?
♪ Look around now ♪
Congrats, superstar.
- Thank you, girl.
- Yeah.
If it wasn't for you
getting all the right people
to repost my little Insta videos,
I wouldn't even be on Cre's radar.
Thank you.
Welcome to the most exclusive
listening party in New York City.
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
You're about to hear
the album of the year before it drops.
Get ready for Cre!
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
Some of you are here
to experience what's next.
- Yes!
- Because this is a listening party.
And you are here to listen.
Y'all ready to listen?
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
Good.
'Cause I want y'all to hear me when I say
I'm tired of being ripped off!
Last time someone stole my work
and leaked one of my tracks online,
what did I say?
Huh?
This is my last album,
but no one's ever gonna hear it
because this world doesn't deserve it!
You should... You should look away.
I mean, I really thought
my dreams were coming true.
But this...  ...this is not a dream.
No, this is...  ...this is a nightmare!
No.
He's gonna have to release the album.
The record label's gonna make him.
He is the label.
He owns it.
Oh.
- Yeah! Just my luck.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

Because I was gonna get married last year
to that beautiful song...
...to a nice man, Jason.
But he left to Charleston,
and I didn't go with him.
You know, he was a banker.
And he used to make these rice bowls,
and I just never made it home on time
to eat them,
and then he called off the wedding.
And he took the rice maker.
I don't have any more rice.
Come on.
Look at me wearing my wedding dress.
And they were singing my wedding song.
I know.
Aw, come on.

Happy Birthday, Jason,

- Holy snap! Really?
- Oh, come on!
Yes!
Thank you.
Now it's time to see
if that wish actually comes true or not.
Oh!
Erica Wilson...
Wait, wait, wait.
Will you marry me?
Yes. Yes.
- Yes?
- Yes!
- You will?
- Yes!
Damn! Come on!
Erica?
Erica?
Erica?
That is not healthy.
What's the last time you went outside?
Outside costs money for one.
And B...
...red wine is full of antioxidants,
so it's practically like a smoothie.
Not really.
Or at least a green juice,
except it's purple.
Okay, look, I know it's been
a tough couple of months,
but that is all about to change
because you're going
to a tropical paradise!
Feast your eyes
on the Mer de Saphir Resort
on the truly,
stupidly gorgeous island of Mauritius.
I'm doing the social media for them,
and the point person mentioned
they were looking for entertainers.
So, I sent him your Instagram,
and he said, "When can she get here?"
Okay, where's Mauritius?
It's 700 miles east of Madagascar.
And look at the Jolly Rancher blue ocean.
Hmm, it's beautiful.
Mm-hmm.
And really, Amber, thank you so much
for always putting me on.
But this is one step up
from singing on a cruise ship.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means
I haven't been grinding my whole life,
chasing my dreams of making my own music,
so I can sing cover songs
in the hotel lobby.
It means I didn't lose a fiancé
to become a lounge singer.
It also means I didn't risk everything,
and I mean everything...
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
- What? Like to be a karaoke singer?
- Who am I?
- Okay. Okay.
I see you ramping up, but let me stop you.
You didn't lose a fiancé.
He lost you by moving to Charleston
for some boring VP job
in finance or whatever.
It's just seasonal.
Four months
and you are back here in New York.
- Mm-mm.
- I think you should consider this.
Because I'm worried
if you don't do something,
you may never shake this funk off of you.
Who do you see yourself as?
Someone who fuses into the couch,
or someone who's ready
to take another leap?
- Erica Wilson?
- Yes. Barrington?
At your service.
Welcome to Mauritius!
I was just getting some band stuff
before, uh, before I got you.
- Oh good.
- Yeah.
But, um, well, I'm in the band, your band.
- Oh?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay. Nice.
- Guitars.
- Cool.
- Uh, I'm also the, um, shuttle driver,
turtle wrangler, craft cocktail chemist.
- Yeah.
- Um, among other things.
Okay, uh, they're...
they're only expecting me
to sing here. Right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I pick up the extra jobs
'cause I'm saving to buy a house.
- Oh?
- Yeah.
I came here a few years ago and, um...
fell in love.
Wow, my gosh. Look at that.
I can see why. I mean, If you can wake up
to this every day forever, why not?
Yeah, the island's beautiful,
but I was talking about my girlfriend.
Ooh.
Well, she's from here
and never wants to leave her home.
Oh, that's cool,
staying here for her.
Incoming.
Hello, Erica. I'm Claire.
I'm sure Barrington's brought you up
to speed with arrival procedures.
Why don't you follow me,
and I'll give you a little tour.
She'll be in cabana 78.
Make sure her luggage
gets there, and Barrington,
remove your vehicle.
And don't be late for rehearsal.
As you know, we are a five-star resort,
and service adds brilliance
to those stars.
Are you prepared to be brilliant?
And here, we have the main pool.
Whoa! Wow!
It's so still and pristine.
I just wanna jump into it.
You like to disturb what is pristine?
Well, you can't.
The pool is off-limits to employees.
Well, then, where do we go swimming?
The beach. Oh, but not the beach
in front of the resort.
There's a public beach two miles up.
What is it?
Oh, it's just a gecko.
They're all over the island.
They're harmless.
It's like a small dinosaur.
And Erica, please, no more screaming.
Only guests get to scream.
Hello, boys, meet Erica.
- Travis. Wayne, also in the band.
- Hi.
- And then, of course, you know Barrington.
- Yes.
Your sets are
from 7:00 to 11:00 p.m. every night
and 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on weekends,
unless there's a wedding.
- Oh, who sings if there's a wedding?
- You do.
Wait, I mean,
no one told me I'd be singing at weddings.
If singing at a wedding is a problem
for you, I can organize flight options,
and you can make your own way back
to New York at your own expense.
Seriously? I'm supposed to take a leap
and move on from a failed singing career
and a failed engagement
to be a wedding singer?
What?
You knew.
It was hard to spin, so...
- It... Amber!
- Okay, but... but think of it this way.
You're facing your demons, which is good.
Oh yeah.
I am facing one right now.
Okay, okay, but how's the island?
I mean, well, it's beautiful,
and the air is wonderful,
and my sinuses are finally clear
after five years,
but I'm about to get on stage
and sing for people who are in love.
Erica! Erica! Look into the camera.
You cannot let what happened with Jason
ruin the rest of your life.
And you certainly can't let him
ruin you on love.
We'd like to invite Stephanie and David
to the dance floor
for their first dance as husband and wife.

Barrington, I am...
I'm just not in a good place.

Help! Help! Please help!
- Hmm?
- Help! Somebody help! Help!
Help me, please! Help!
Help! Help me, please!
- Help! I...
- Hold on!
- I got you!
- Help me, please!
Oh, thank you!
Oh, thank you.
Wait, wait. My GoPro! My... My GoPro!
Okay.
Okay, sir, you need to tell me
where it hurts, all right?
Ma'am, are you okay?
- Yeah.
- My camera. My beautiful camera.
My... my whole trip is lost, my memories...
I saw it on the swim out.
- You saved it!
- Okay. All right. All right. Okay.
Should we get a pic for the grid?
- What?
- No? Okay.
Hey, fam,
have you ever thought about the end?
I have.
I've had a life-changing experience.
Yeah, thanks.
Wow.
Hey, do you, um...
...know any restaurants around here?
'Cause I could use a bite.
Um...
Yeah, and a drink too.
You know,
I read about this coconut water-rum thing.
How are you so calm?
That man almost drowned. I almost drowned.
I was just lucky I saw you
and could help out a bit.
You were so brave
just running out there with no training.
Yeah? Well, you ran out there, too.
Do you have any training?
US military, Special Forces.
Retired.
When you say it that way...
Okay. All right.
- Well, I guess that makes, uh, more sense.
- Caleb.
I... Erica.
Nice to meet you.
So, are you here on vacation alone?
Uh, not quite a vacation.
I'm here for my brother's wedding.
And I could finally make a family function
after a while. So, here I am.
Nice.
And you? I mean, what,
a fisher or amateur lifeguard?
No, I'm here singing at a resort.
- Oh?
- Yeah.
- A singer?
- Yes.
Wow, that's cool.
A spy. Well, that's cooler.
No, not a spy, just muscle for the spies.
Ah, okay. Well, spy security.
- Security for the spies. Yes.
- I like that.
Yes.
So, do you
wanna join me
for that coconut-rum drink thing?
Um, I actually have to...
I gotta get to work soon.
Oh, okay.
Um, well, I would love to check on you.
Gotta make sure that you're okay after
your underwater aquatic rescue mission.
You know, it's a really small island.
I'm sure we will bump into each other.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You're back early.
Isn't it your night off?
It is.
And it was a weird day,
but then I met someone I really liked.
And then I bailed on him.
Oh, Erica.
Oh, he was a tourist or a spy.
Uh, it's all good.
Oh, a spy.
No. Either way,
I probably would've never heard
from him again. Yeah.
Wha...
♪ Sky could be blue as can be ♪
♪ Grass could be green, green, too ♪
♪ My love the same as them ♪
♪ They're facts, it's true, it's true ♪
♪ Sky could be blue as can be... ♪
I guess it really is a small island.
How did you find me?
Uh, I didn't.
My brother's wedding is here.
Of course.
I mean, not just... you're not just
running around looking for me.
Actually, I was gonna call
every hotel in town
asking if they had a singer named Erica.
No, you weren't.
I would have found you.
Oh, and right there
is the happy couple now.
Oh, wow, you are very strong.
Wait, you're Caleb King?
What? How do you...
Jason mentioned his military brother
for years, but we never met.
You're that Erica?
Jason's Erica?
Not anymore.
Yo, Caleb! We're taking the tour?
Ooh, you can bring your little friend
if you want... Oh my God.
What... What are you doing?
She can't be here. What...
- Hello Christian.
- She works here.
- No.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
- Yeah. I work here.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
And the gift bags are stored where?
The gift bags are stored
in a staging area...
Baby, they have it handled. It's true.
Oh, and here comes my sister.
...down-home southern lady.
So when I say 100% of the packaging
needs to be re-plantable seedlings,
I mean it.
All right, bye.
Okay, what's the next leg of the tour?
- We are waiting on the rest of your party.
- Oh, they're right over there.
With...
Erica?
Yes. Erica.
She will be singing at your wedding.
Oh my God.
- Baby, you're leaking papaya.
- Oh.
Wait, how do...
how do you know the wedding singer?
We, uh...
We know Erica from New York.
What?
- Wait, what a small world.
- No way.
- Look at you.
- Come on.
Erica!
What a surprise.
Please don't say anything.
Hey, so, what are you doing here,
so far away from where you normally are?
I... I'm here singing. Um...
I think what brings you here
is way more interesting.
- Uh, well, Erica, this is...
- Yes, this is...
- I'm Beverly, Jason's fiancée.
- Mm-hmm.
- Erica.
- Nice to meet you.
- Uh...
- She and Jason...
- Yeah, we... this, uh...
- You know each other from New York?
- Right.
- Yeah. I see you know Christian, too.
Hmm.
We all used to live in the same building.
- Yes! We got to know each other from, uh...
- ...when it was the club.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- A club?
- Yeah, it was a...
- Right, it wasn't really a dance club.
No. It was... It was...
It was a... It was a book club.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
What luck running into Erica.
You don't often find employees
in the lobby unless they are working.
It's such a treat that you're here.
I never get to meet Jason's friends,
'cause you guys are all up in New York.
And we've been so swamped.
Can't get out of Charleston...
Oh, right. You moved to Charleston.
I was the first person he met
when he moved there,
right across the hall from me.
Wow, first person, huh?
Wasn't that, like, a year ago?
But didn't give you a lot of time
to plan a wedding, huh?
- Ha!
- No, he didn't. But I... I don't need it.
We just wanted it to be really intimate.
So, for me, that's me, my sister Janelle,
and, uh, Jason's parents are coming,
a few of our friends,
but that's it. That's all we needed.
That is so sweet.
Hey, um, why don't you take, uh, Janelle
to the spa,
and I'll come meet you
for cell regeneration time.
Thank you.
Okay, okay, yes,
it was so good to meet you.
Come on, Janelle, wanna show me
your secret plans for the weekend?
- Okay, bye. Okay, bye.
- Bye.
How could you?
I can't believe you're getting married.
I can't believe you're here!
What are you even...
What are you doing here?
Amber does social media for this resort.
They needed a singer.
No wonder I kept gettin' ads
about this place.
Wait. What happened with Cre
and the album?
Cre scrapped it.
Someone leaked one of the tracks,
and he just destroyed the whole thing,
along with my career.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
Yeah, me too.
But if Beverly finds out we were engaged,
it'll cause so many problems.
- So please just...
- Wait, she doesn't know?
I could...
I could never seem to find the right time.
You know, I guess it's never really
a good time to tell your new fiancée
how you walked out on your old fiancée
a month before the wedding.
Wait a minute.
I didn't walk out on you, okay?
You walked out every single day
to the studio.
And you know what? By the time
the job offer came up in Charleston,
there wasn't a relationship
to even walk out on.
What? So you leave without talking to me,
and I'm the bad guy?
Listen, you were never there to...
- You know what? Rehashing this...
- Rehash?
Oh no. You know...
You know what? It was never hashed.
You were just gone.
Okay.
I did not do 48 hours
of therapy for this, okay?
Hmm.
- We're here for a few days.
- Mm-hmm.
We can avoid each other. Easy.
Yeah, mm-hmm. Don't expect me to sing
at your wedding.
Good. I don't. Tell 'em you're sick
or something. Call in.
- I will gladly do that.
- Well, good!
- But you won't tell Beverly, right?
- Go, go, go, go!
Morning.
Hi.
Did you just hear that?
There's an echo in here,
so, uh, I heard it.
Twice.
I guess you know now why I hate weddings.
Erica, why didn't you just tell us?
I didn't want to relive it.
- Does she really work here?
- Dude, Amber does...
It's not funny, man!
- What are you gonna tell Beverly?
- Nothin'.
Beverly finds out I was engaged
to Erica, she will lose it.
Okay, then, you gotta come clean.
Look, if you get caught lyin'...
Okay, listen, I know you mean well,
but I don't need the Honor-Duty
Captain America speech right now.
- Wow, Captain America?
- Okay?
Wasn't Special Forces.
Ooh.
All I'm sayin'
is perfect honesty isn't always possible
in 24-7 civilian life.
Hmm, yep.
And no one is expecting you to be perfect,
just honest.
And sometimes, keeping things to yourself
is the best way to go.
Otherwise,
I'll end up with two ex-fiancées.
I wonder if I should try
for a wedding commission from the hotel
since they found it through me.
- Amber!
- I'm sorry.
This is not about business.
Look, I'll... I'll conveniently come down
with a cold the day of his wedding.
In the meantime,
we'll just avoid each other.
What? This is a good, sane plan.
Look, I gotta get ready for work.
It's a big resort. It can't be that hard.
Erica! Girl, hey!
Fancy runnin' into you.
Yes.
You know, it's... it's too bad.
I'm actually running late for, um...
The meeting about the music,
the wedding music?
Right. That's right now.
- Yes, right now.
- Yes, girl, come on. We'll go find Jason.
He's around here somewhere.
It is such serendipity that you're here.
Yeah. That's definitely a word for it.
I gotta tell you. I... I was so worried
Jason was missing his life in New York,
so to have you here is just...
Oh, wait, you should come hiking
with us tomorrow.
Oh no. You know, I'm...
I'm not much of a hiker. I... Bad arches.
Oh, no, girl, please. It'll be fun.
We usually discourage employees
from fraternizing with the guests.
Resort rules. Right. Sorry.
But guest wishes always come first,
and I would hate to put two friends apart.
Yes, thank you!
- We... We're more like book club members.
- No. Thank you.
Bonne journée, Erica.
So, Beverly tells me you don't have
your wedding song yet? Really?
Perhaps I can make a suggestion.
- Oh please.
- Yeah?
Okay, great. How about
"Unbreak My Heart" by Toni Braxton.
- Uh, for a wedding?
- Mm. Mm-hmm. Yep.
Or, what about "Irreplaceable" by Beyoncé?
Uh, girl, that's a breakup song.
Mm.
- I've always loved "Diamonds" by Rihanna.
- Yeah!
- Mm.
- Yeah, I like that.
Wait! Wait!
You know what will be a really good one?
"No One" by Alicia Keys.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Why?
Well, when you first moved in
across the hall from me,
you used to play that song on repeat,
and so loud.
I found myself humming it
before I met you, which...
I don't know, feels like a sign.
- Does it?
- Yeah.
'Cause, I kinda liked your first instinct,
Rihanna, "Diamonds," better.
Aw, baby, you do?
- Yeah.
- Mm.
So sweet. Oh...
Yeah. Oh!
So we're settled. We got our wedding song.
So, how many more of these we gotta pick?
Oh, do you mind if we, uh, pick the rest
on the hike tomorrow?
- Need to get some rest.
- Sure. Tomorrow's fine.
- Wait, what? What... What do you mean?
- Oh, I invited Erica to come hiking.
- You didn't?
- Yeah, I did.
Caleb.
- Good morning.
- Hi.
- It was quite a day yesterday, huh?
- Mm, don't know what you're talkin' about.
Did you tell Jason we met?
Yeah, I figured I would...
- No, I didn't.
- Ah, yes.
Okay.
Another thing to keep a secret. I got it.
Hey, would you wanna take a walk later?
I've got, uh, wedding stuff now.
- Breakfast and a hike, but...
- I know. I'm actually headed there.
Beverly invited me.
Wow.
You think that's a good idea?
No.
- Definitely not.
- Okay.
I can't believe you live here.
You must wake up every day
and pinch yourself.
I do. I do, but I'm still trying
to get used to the lizards, though.
- We don't have those in the city.
- Does proliferation have one "l" or two?
Uh, one.
Do you miss New York at all?
You know, I thought I would,
but I don't mostly.
You know, there's nothing
to really go back to.
Yeah, I blew a good thing back there, so...
Too many memories.
Uh, no, you didn't.
Cre blew it by not releasing the album.
- Hmm.
- Jason told me about that.
It's just awful.
Oh yeah, I mean, there's that, too,
but I wasn't talking about my album.
- I was talking about my engagement.
- Hmm.
- You were engaged?
- Hmm, I was, but...
My fiancé got a really great job offer
in a small town,
and he wanted to settle down, have kids,
and I wasn't ready to walk away
from my dreams of becoming a singer.
A woman should never have to give up
on her dream for a man.
- And the right man won't make her.
- Mm.
Jason supports me
one hundred percent in my dreams.
Representing the great state
of South Carolina in the US Congress.
Ooh, okay, you're running for Congress.
Eventually. Right now, I work in policy
development for the city council.
Wow, that is amazing,
and with the support of your partner.
I am a lucky girl.
Yeah, I don't think he knew how important
my dreams were to me.
- Hmm.
- Or maybe he just didn't care.
Or maybe he thought your dreams were
way more important than he was.
If he was the love of her life,
he would have known.
Mm, that part.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe. Maybe.
I don't know.
Wait. Do you still think
he's the love of your life?
- Morning!
- Ooh!
Who's ready for an adventure?
- I am. Y'all, let's go. Let's go.
- Yep. Okay.
- Oh, okay.
- That might be a bit warm.
Does it have any Wi-Fi there?
On the mountain?
Uh, probably not.
Beverly, you didn't tell me...
Jason, look at this. Oh my gosh!
- It's even better than I thought.
- And we're here.
All right, you guys are gonna love
this rope bridge.
The views will make you just go, "Wow!"
All right? One hand
on the guide cables at all times.
Okie smokie?
- Okie smokie.
- Let's do it!
- Whoo!
- Okay, we got it. You first.
Hope nobody's afraid of heights.
You sure about this?
Caleb, this isn't summer camp, huh.
I'm a grown man.
All right.
- Whoo! Let's go.
- Yeah, let's do it.
You can go on and follow Beverly.
Nah, you... you go ahead.
I'll pull up the rear.
You know, just in case
a giant lizard comes for you.
I'd like to see that.
Guys ready?
All right, let's go.
Let's do it.
- You got this, Jay.
- Whoo!
Whoo!
That was fun.
I can still feel the pendulum of gravity.
Mm. Mm. Mm.
- Hey.
- Hmm. What? I'm a little parched.
What? No. Look at Jason.
- Camp Pulaski all over again.
- Oh.
What? No, he's fine.
- It's easy. He's enjoying the view.
- With his knees bucklin' like that?
Come on, don't look down.
Don't look down.
Okay.
And he's frozen.
- I'll go get him.
- Oh.
I think someone's doin' that.
Jason.
It's Camp Pulaski again.
No, it's not.
Jason Xavior King, look at me.
You can do this.
I know you can.
Take my hand.
Just trust me.
Okay.
Baby!
- Baby, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm good.
It was just a moment, baby.
It was just... I'm... I'm fine now.
Why didn't you say
you're afraid of heights?
Babe, I would have kept you
on solid ground. Oh, silly man.
Hey, it was just a little thing
I had when I was a kid.
Thought I was over it, but guess I'm not.
Yeah!
All right! Everybody ready?
We must toast to the gods.
- Salud!
- Salud!
Salud!
Jason! Are you feeling better, man?
I mean, that bridge had you rocked.
- Dude, I'm... I'm... I'm all right.
- He's always had trouble with heights.
Erica, you were so smooth
how you went back out on that bridge
to talk our boy back to land.
And you were so calm, too, before we knew
he was having a hard time.
- How'd you know?
- Well, I was just closer. That's all.
- Any of you guys would have done the same.
- Not me.
You have a knack for helping people,
like saving that guy at the beach.
- When was this?
- That's crazy.
Um, when I went
for that walk after I landed.
You have to come with me and Janelle
to my bachelorette night.
- Oh, yes!
- We need that light around us.
You gotta come. You gotta come.
♪ You know you wanna do it ♪
♪ You know you wanna do it ♪
Come on, please!
- Yes.
- Yes!
- Yeah!
- I'll do it. I'll do it.
Um, but first,
I need to get my booty to bed.
It's been a long day.
- I'll walk you back.
- Okay.
The gentleman.
So, what happened back there, huh?
Thought you were gonna keep
our first little meeting to yourself.
It slipped out.
Okay, so, you were in secret missions
in the Middle East,
but that just slipped out? All right.
Hey, look, why does it matter?
Earlier today, Beverly asked
if Jason is the love of your life.
- She asked if my nameless ex was...
- Well, do you?
What?
Do you think
that Jason is the love of your life?
Because you're worried
if he knows that we met on a beach.
Why do you care?
Look, he's
my baby brother.
And we may not have been
on the best footing for a while now,
but I still want what's best for him.
Well, we were together
for four and a half years.
Those feelings don't just go away,
you know.
I don't.
But being in the military
wasn't ideal for long-term relationships.
I've never had that big type of love.
No international whirlwind love affairs?
Affairs, yeah.
Yeah.
Love...
no.
Did you really have to make a big deal
about that bridge thing?
Bro, you froze.
It happens.
I mean, I was
in the Coachella Ferris wheel once and...
Making me look like a wimp
in front of everybody.
There's my brother there to see it.
No one's thinkin' of you like that.
Now he's probably off
who knows where with Erica.
So what?
- So, what if I made a mistake?
- Hmm.
- What if I should have married her?
- You...
You said, "Marry Erica?"
Bro...
I was out on that bridge today...
and she was with me.
Huh? Oh.
What if I made a mistake
runnin' away from her?

- What's going on, Jason?
- This is a lot, you know?
My parents are gonna be here tomorrow.
They haven't even met Beverly yet.
Wait, who meets their in-laws
at their wedding?
- Well, you know how my mom is.
- Okay.
You must really wanna marry her
to keep Naomi away until the wedding.
Mm-hmm.
Wish you did that for me.
- I should go back to the stage.
- Can we talk? Later?
I'm roped into a bachelorette party
tonight, remember?
See if you can get away.
I'll try.
Okay.
What am I doing?
What are you doing?
He said, and I quote,
"I thought I was over it, but I'm not."
Yeah, about his fear of heights.
Well, he...
he already called off one wedding.
Girl. Yours.
Okay, I gotta go. I'm meeting with Beverly
and her sister at the bar.
Have you lost your damn mind?
I thought the plan was to avoid them.
I tried.
Fake a case of diarrhea.
No one questions diarrhea.
Ew! Gross.
Okie dokie, who's ready for some karaoke?
Whoo!
All right,
first up, we have the bride-to-be...
Beverly!
That's my sister, y'all.
She gettin' married.

So, Jason, this is all you wanna do?
Obviously, it's your bachelor party.
You know what?
Not really feelin' in a party mood
after that business yesterday.
Mm.
What business?
Oh, no, no, no. Let's not go there.
"What business?"
I have one little height-related episode...
And we're going there.
...and you go and you pick at it.
Jason, look,
you've always had this in your head.
I'm sorry for being born first.
You look down on me just because you're
so used to being the hero in everything.
Hey, hey, you know
I found a brother on 23andMe?
Look, but I am not sorry
for being good at what I like to do, man.
Leaving no space for me?
I couldn't even get past your shadow
in the chess club.
His name's Raymond.
It's not enough that you're this big,
bad military hero everybody can worship.
Okay, look, Jason, do you know
that Mom used to email me pictures
of your cubicle up to your corner office?
She sends those to everybody.
She sends it to everybody
'cause she loves you. She's proud of you.
You are my brilliant, little brother, man.
And no one is judging you,
or comparing you to anyone.
Look, make your own choices
and stick by them.
That's what being a man is.
Okay. Don't lecture me about
what being a man is.
- I know you're not standing...
- I'm walking down the aisle.
- That's manly.
- No. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Hey! Hey!
You're brothers!
We all want what's best for each other.
Let's not forget that.
Nor should we forget
that I spent $6,000
on this 1974 single malt scotch.
- Okay, now, that's insane.
- Yeah, yeah, but we will drink it.
- We will absolutely drink it.
- Yes.
Good, good. This cost a lot of money,
and I don't even like whiskey.

Get off your phone!
Work stuff.
"Work stuff."
Ooh!
Tequila shots for everybody!
- Especially you.
- Thank you.
Here you go.
One, two, three.
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.
- You better come back.
- You better.
- Hey.
- Jason...
I was walking back to my room
and then your room,
and then I couldn't decide,
so I chose the ground.
Thanks.
Um...
Everything's happening
so fast, you know. Um...
And it's really...
It's really bringing up a lot for me.
You know?
Me too.
And, um...
you think I left
because I chose the job over you.
But in reality,
it's because I thought you didn't need me,
not like you need your music.
That's what got you through your day.
I didn't think I could compete with that.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry
I made it feel like a competition.
And I'm sorry for hurting you, Erica.
Jason,
these last six weeks,
I have watched people get married,
and they all looked so happy.
The thought of having to watch you
get married to someone, and it's not me...
Come here. Come here. Come here.
It's okay.
Oh my God!
Erica! Erica, girl, where have you been?
Janelle had to step out
for a work emergency.
Get back up here 'cause I'm
singing "Shallow" next. Both parts!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Where's my tiara?
Uh, you... you gifted it to the bartender
for her kindness and grace.
Oh, yeah.
You should probably drink
some more of your water, please.
Oh, I have another one back home
in Charleston.
You know I was Miss Charleston?
Mm.
Get out of town. Wow.
Oh my God.
- Oh my God.
- Mm.
I just thought of something.
I'm really gonna be a queen
because I'm marrying a king.
'Cause Jason's last name is... King.
Yep. I get it. I get it.
You're not gonna keep your last name, huh?
Uh, for my political career, of course.
But I think...
I think in my personal life, I'm...
I'm just gonna be Mrs. King.
Oh my God, I can't help it.
I am so traditional.
I want the white picket fence.
I want two babies.
I want church on Sunday.
And I just love feeding people, you know.
My mom and dad used to have
these huge Sunday night dinners, right?
Every Sunday after church.
And then, when they were gone...
Um...
Anyway, I wanna do the same thing.
And...
And I have these two crock pots, right,
and Jason has this one rice cooker
that he loves.
And I... I can just
smell the home
I wanna make with him.
I can literally hear our kids just playing
on the swing on the wraparound porch.
I know that sounds so weird. I'm sorry.
No, no. Actually...
It's actually... It's really nice.
Here, I... I am so sorry
your fiancé broke up with you.
But you know what? Screw him.
He's lost the best thing he'll ever have.
- I don't know about that.
- No, I do.
You know, the men in our lives,
they think they're our everything.
Although they are not.
Amen to that.
That actually needs to be official.
I think I wanna legislate that one day.
I'm... I'm sure you will.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Oh shit! My name is Beverly Strattford,
and I approve this message. Okay?
Right. Yes, girl.
Oh, man.
Ooh. Ooh.
- I'm gonna leave this here, just in case.
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right. You sure you're okay?
- I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Mm.
Was that your phone or mine?
- Mine.
- Oh...
Who's texting you this late, Ms. Erica?
Just one of the band
confirming rehearsal tomorrow.
Oh, will I see you
at the rehearsal dinner tomorrow?
Uh...
I have to work.
Well, then I will see you at the wedding!
Okay.
Oh, Erica.
Girl, I'm so happy I met you.
I really feel like we're becoming friends.
Good night.
Oh...
Hey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Uh, what are you...
What are you doing out here?
What are you doing here?
Well, it is finally cool enough
to go for a run. So... here I am.
I like to meditate
at this time of the night.
Oh.
How was the bachelor party?
Well, we just smoked cigars,
and sat by an infinity pool,
and drank overpriced whiskey.
How was your thing?
Mine was...
It was actually fun. I have to admit.
Jason left us early.
Said he had to go work, but probably
just snuck off to be with Beverly.
Hmm.
So, do you wanna go meditate?
Ah, let's... let's give it a try.
Okay. After you.
- No, I can't believe that. Okay, this one.
- Uh...
Believe it or not...
- The trombone.
- I knew you would say that.
All right, how about this one?
Yeah, that is the scar
that changed my entire life.
- I blew it out on my last mission.
- Oh.
And just like that,
the only life that I know... I...
I knew,
really is gone.
Not many people
can see those types of scars.
Hmm. True.
I look at that scar and think to myself,
it has put me on a path,
and I don't know where it's gonna lead.
Hmm.
No one is coming to pick me up
to take me to my next mission.
And I keep imagining my family and...
...everyone...
expecting me to know
what I'm gonna do next, but...
I don't.
And for the first time in my life, I have
no plan.
Maybe you should own that.
Yeah. Don't worry about
what everybody expects of you.
I don't know how to do that.
Hmm.
Neither do I.
I guess.
It's harder trying to get over
what you expect of yourself.
Yeah, that's the one.
'Cause I definitely expected
that album would be my big break.
Hmm.
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure that I am.
But I do know
that the music is still with me.
And though I have no plan...
...I know I'm meant to sing.
That's why God gave me this voice.
Well, you can't argue with God.
No.
Especially not
when he makes a sunrise like that.
Wow.
Okay, I...
...should go get some sleep
before my parents get here.
Seeing my mom
for the first time in a few years
requires at least four hours.
Oh wow.
- Um, I'm gonna go...
- Yeah.
...hide.
See you later.
- Before your mom sees me.
- Yeah.
Then the sand's gonna hit the fan.
- All right.
- Yeah.
- Good night!
- See you later.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.
I've got to be real.
Today's a very difficult day for me.
I'm losing my baby.
My blanket in the shade.
Oh, Mom!
I used to use his little body
as a shawl on picnics.
Okay.
And it's been cold without him.
Attention! Attention. Attention, everyone!
Oh God. Oh no.
Attention, everyone!
There's something I have to say.
Okay.
I'm losing my baby...
Come on, say it. Say it.
...to a siren's call.
- What?
- Oh, Jesus!
And in times like these,
I turn to Bette Midler
for the right words.
Oh no!
What does Bette Midler have
to do with anything?

- Oh no!
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- ...for the people in the back.
- Mom, Mom. Hey, hey, hey... Um... Okay. Wow.
She was just getting started, too.
You've given these people
enough of your gift.
Uh-uh. We cannot be stingy with our songs
of love and devotion, baby.
I know, but it's my turn to toast Jason.
And I've really
been looking forward to it.
Oh, oh, well, for you, baby.
For you.
Hello, everyone.
I am Caleb King,
Jason's older brother.
Now, I don't...
I don't know much about relationships.
I've never been married, but I know what
it's like to be committed wholeheartedly.
And that is what you two
are about to do tomorrow.
Commitment is
an active breathing thing.
Too many people walk away easily...
give up easily.
But the strength and love that it takes
to choose commitment,
well, that...
that is something to look up to.
And I do.
So...
...from everyone at this table,
congratulations, Beverly and Jason.
Cheers!
- Thank you.
- Cheers.
You should really ask who's there
before you open the door.
What are you doing here?
It's over.
- Jason called off the wedding?
- What?
No. The rehearsal dinner.
But...
...I think he's having cold feet.
So I figured I'd keep watch.
In case he tries anything stupid.
What do you mean by s... stupid?
You have another one of those?
Okay, "Wind Beneath My Wings"
is actually a good choice,
but I would take Naomi for more
of a "I Will Always Love You."
Yeah. That kinda mother-in-law.
Just a little bit more menacing.
Yeah, with a headscarf.
Running off the plane like Whitney
at the end of The Bodyguard.
- She has one of those headscarves, too.
- Yes, I bet.
I bet you're glad you don't have
to deal with her?
Maybe.
Or...
...maybe I would have grown to like her.
You would have.
I mean, look, she's
crazy...
...but all that drama
is just how she knows how to show love.
You know?
Yeah. I guess things
could definitely be worse.
Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
You mind if I take these off?
Oh, so you really are staying, aren't you?
That is the plan.
Hmm.
You were expecting Jason, weren't you?
I don't know.
- Hmm.
- Maybe.
You want me to leave?
No, not really.
You know what...
always cheers me up?
Okay, samurai movies
are what cheer you up?
Yeah. Sure do.
All right. Okay.
All right. So there's one guy.
He pulls out a sword on another guy.
And then they clash steel, and then what?
What happens?
I mean, how does that guy know
he's slicing up the right guy?
Well, see, they have a code of honor
that they live by.
- Well, okay, I wish life was that easy.
- Mm.
Well...
...it's not supposed to be.
I mean, look,
the most interesting samurais,
the ones you root for,
are complicated heroes.
- Hey!
- Hey.
- I thought you were in your sister's room.
- I was.
- Wait. Where are you going?
- I was just gettin' some air.
Okay. Um...
- Can I...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Baby, I'm sorry I didn't believe you
when you said your parents were a lot.
And I'm so sorry
that I was so cranky at dinner.
Um...
I wanna marry you
more than anything in the world,
but I can't lie.
Baby, I'm nerv... I'm nervous.
Hey. Hey.
I'm nervous, too.
- Really?
- Yeah, so nervous.
Okay, I mean,
maybe we can just be nervous together.
Deal.
Oh.
You asleep?
I was.
Thank you for staying.
Of course.
- We should get some sleep.
- All right. Yep.
Um...
Um, I can take the couch.
You can have the bed.
No. You...
take your bed. I'll take the couch.
Okay. Here.
Ooh, yeah.
Kidding!
Oh, my goodness!
I can't believe
you weren't going to say anything, though.
Speechless!
- Goodnight!
- Night.
Mm.
Coming!
Erica, I need to talk to you.
Jason, um,
this isn't exactly the right time. I...
What are you doin' here?
Look... Jason...
- I knew somethin' was goin' on.
- What? No. We were...
- We were just watching Netflix and fell...
- Oh, Netflix and chill.
Now I feel real good about the situation.
He doesn't even know
what that means, Jason.
I... I know what it means.
I know what it means.
But it was... it was just Netflix,
all right? There was no chill.
Jason, even if it was,
you're getting married today, remember?
Erica, goin' after him isn't gonna
help either one of you right now.
Erica?
Erica?
Erica, you should be
with someone who is sure
that you're the only choice for him.
That man is not Jason.
Jason!
Hey! Okay, you stop this right now.
This craziness stops right now.
- We're not running through the sand.
- Oh, how... My brother? Really?
Nothing happened.
But are you... are you really jealous, or
are you having cold feet, Jason?
I don't know.
I screwed everything up with you.
What's gonna stop me
from screwin' everything up with her, too?
We screwed things up for each other.
Jason, the truth is,
if you hadn't called off the wedding,
I probably would have.
Then...
Then what is all of this?
Nostalgia.
Coincidence. Guilt. Uh, I don't know.
Maybe all of the above.
But if this was right...
and you were the love of my life,
then it would not be this hard.
I love her.
I was on my over to tell you that.
Then I saw Caleb,
and I just lost it. I just...
Look at me. I'm gonna screw this up.
I'm gonna screw this up.
- I know I'm gonna screw this up...
- No. Look. No. Listen. No, you're not!
Beverly loves you.
You love her.
Hmm.
I feel like you're walkin' me across
another bridge.
Well...
we got across the last one, right?
Yeah.
- We did.
- Mm-hmm.
Come on. Let's get you married.
Yes, big sis.
Ma chérie. C'est trop bien.
You look so beautiful!
You like the sun behind you?
Comfortable with those shadows?
No, I love the shade.
These are just some candid shots. So...
The photographers gonna come any minute.
Don't... Any second...
Maybe if she stands with
her better side forward.
- Okay, careful now.
- Thank you, Ms. King.
Thank you.
- Wow. All right then.
- Is that Erica with Jason?
Why on earth would my son
invite his ex to his wedding?
His ex?
Thank God he had the good sense
to call that off.
But this staying friends
with your ex, ugh...
When?
When did he break up with her?
- About a month before the wedding.
- Okay, "the wedding." Oh.
Mm-hmm.
- When were they engaged?
- Last year.
Little hussy messed
with the wrong family.
She's gonna curse the day she ever came
to the wedding.
You better call the ambulance.
Call the Mauritian police!
Erica!
Janelle?
- You lying, scheming, two-faced...
- It's not what you think!
I know where you live.
Where is she?
Erica! Erica, I need your help.
Beverly's sister called all out of breath.
Beverly has canceled the wedding.
Oh no!
Yes, and she's run away.
Nobody can find her. It's terrible.
Not for us. They still have to pay
for the wedding, but I feel bad.
She was breathing out a lot of emotion.
If you can help,
I would be eternally grateful.
Of course. Okay.
I'll... I'll... I'm on it. I'm on it.
The cabanas are the other way.
Have you forgotten your ground tutorial?
Oh, c'est impossible.
Yeah, you better run, Erica!
- Oh, this is not a good time.
- Drive!
Get out!
See what I mean?
You get out of this van right now!
I know that you and Jason were engaged.
I know you've been lying to me
this whole time.
Make her get out of this van!
- Wait. Let me fix this.
- How could you possibly fix this?
- Look, you deserve the truth. You do.
- The truth.
But... But let me... let me share this truth
a little bit further down the road.
- What?
- Further down. Just keep driving.
- Take me to the airport.
- There's been a misunderstanding.
A mis... I saw the two of you
on the beach... Know what? Never mind.
I will give you $200
if you throw her out of this van.
Okay? Five, if it is still moving.
Don't even think about it.
If you don't throw her out of this van
right now, I'mma start swingin'.
All right. All right.
Okay, this is not part of my job.
Barrington.
Wait, wait. What are you doing?
- I just...
- No. No, no, no, no.
Okay, I bruise easily.
- Okay.
- No, no. No, no, no, no, no.
- Barrington!
- No! Don't leave me here with her.
- Come back! She's crazy!
- You cannot leave me here!
- Barrington!
- Barrington!
You and Jason ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.
Beverly! Beverly, I swear,
nothing happened between us.
Why should I believe you?
You've been lying to me this whole time.
Okay, look...
Okay, we have history,
and we should have told you, but... but...
but we were... we were both afraid that...
Well, this would happen!
I feel like such an idiot.
No, no. Please, please, look, look, look,
Jason and I are the idiots.
- Maybe you do belong together, then.
- No, we don't.
Because you're his perfect match.
You know that dream that you have?
The both of you have?
The... The porch swing.
The children.
I... I got hives just listening.
Well, why were you sneaking
behind my back, then?
Because we were blindsided.
Truly, wh... what are the odds
of him showing up here to get married?
Actually, they're pretty good considering
Amber's really good at manipulating
social media algorithms,
but... but still.
I'm not some country
fried-green-tomato idiot, okay?
No, of course, you're not.
Well, the truth is...
Beverly, I never got closure.
I was happy, and I was hustling,
and all of a sudden, Jason was gone.
And I was sad,
but I was gonna be okay.
I was gonna make my music.
Because the love of my life
since I was a little girl was music.
I still thought my dream was coming true.
Mm-hmm.
But that dream
was never getting married to Jason,
and that should have been my dream.
It should have been it.
It was my dream.
Then why are you giving up so easily?
Just the idea
that Jason wasn't sure about me,
even just for a moment,
it hurts.
I know, and I'm sorry.
But Jason is so sure.
And if you don't believe me,
just... just please, just go hear him out.
Give him a chance to prove
that he is still the man of your dreams.
I... I do believe you.
I do.
But come on, th... this isn't how
I envisioned my wedding day.
Well, your wedding day isn't over.
Let's get you back there,
and you go marry the man that you love.
You're coming with me.
No. No.
Yeah,
because you need your closure.
And I need someone to sing at my wedding.
Okay.
I would be honored.
Come here.
This hug is gonna have to wait.
I'm, uh, I'm gonna go get Barrington.
- Everything's gonna be okay. Hang on.
- Erica!
We'll... We'll get back to the resort...
Janelle, no!
We are gathered here today
to witness the union
of Beverly Strattford and Jason King.
The bride and groom have chosen
to recite their own vows.
Should be interesting.
Jason.
Beverly,
when people say, "I love you,"
I think they focus on the "love" part,
and they don't recognize the "you" part.
When I say "you,"
I mean every moment of you.
The you that hums when she stirs her tea.
The you that gets so excited
by public policy.
The you that makes me lunches every day
before I go to work.
The one-day-mother-of-my-children you.
And that smile,
that washed my heart with sun
the first day I met you,
I love and I appreciate that you.
And I am so thankful and so honored
I get to love all of you,
from now until eternity.
Beverly, I love you.
Wow. Ooh...
This is...
Um, it was beautiful.
Whoo. Beverly.
Um...
I had a poem that I wrote for you.
Um, and it has imagery and...
Doesn't matter.
Baby.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
You are my dream.
Sorry.
And now, if there's anyone here
who knows why
these two should not
be joined together in holy matrimony...
Don't you even. Jason is not your husband.
This man to the left
in the blue leisure suit,
that's your husband.
It's lapis.
- Mom.
- I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss, again.
- Yeah!
- That's my man.
- That went perfect!
- Come on!
- Wow! Oh my God.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Classy for the ladies.
- Hey, I love you guys.
- Cheers.
- Cheers!
- Love, prosperity...
- All right. Cool, well...
- All that.
You ain't even... Oh, my goodness. Okay.
You got it on my leg.
I'm sorry.
I'm really excited. I'm really excited.
You seem happy.
You know, for a while there,
I doubted I'd ever be again,
but look at me.
I am.
You know what? Hold that thought.
Whoo.
Beverly.
Jason.
Now, I know you wanted
your wedding song to be "Diamonds,"
and I know that's a beautiful song.
But to me, it doesn't capture the love
that you have for each other,
and it doesn't express the love
that I have for the both of you
as my friends, so here it goes.
- What's she gonna do?
- Yeah...
Oh my God.

Okay, this must be important

Have you seen Cre's Instagram?
He's going back into the studio.
Hmm. Good for him.
Maybe he'll actually release this one.
You should get in touch with his people.
This could be your second chance.
There'll be other chances.
Okay. I'm about to take another leap.
I'll call you later.
