You can sit in
the chair there.
How we feeling today?
It's a big day for you, huh?
Last session as a guest here.
Three years just flies,
doesn't it? Must feel great.
You've come
a long way, buddy.
And I appreciate your help.
Walter, my friend,
you are book-worthy.
I'm thinking a whole chapter.
My new one comes out
next spring, I'm going
for a broader market,
and the story of a man in
a mountain climbing accident
who cut his own friends
off the rope to save himself,
convicted of
second-degree manslaughter,
that's compelling stuff.
Technically, I took
a plea bargain.
Yes, and technically,
that means you pled guilty.
Just one formality to cover.
This sets out the schedule
of your appointments
for the next year.
But the judge
said I wouldn't...
The judge doesn't mandate
the need for continued
treatment. I do.
Just because I think
it's safe for you
to see different trees
doesn't mean that
our work here is done.
One year
mandatory treatment.
Then we re-evaluate.
Look, I understand
what I did was wrong.
I know three people are dead
because of what I did.
I'm sorry for that.
I believe you.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
getting a conditional release.
But it's the choice business
where we get hung up.
I realize I could have made
different choices that day.
See, that's where
the sincerity gets
sticky for me.
'Cause I remember
your exact words,
Walter. Do you?
You said, "Anyone would make
the same choice I did."
Anyone.
I don't believe
that anymore.
Those are just words, Walter.
Let's see how
you do out there.
One year.
Continue treatment.
It's either that or
go back to your room.
You know what
that is, Walter?
That's progress.
Progress doesn't
mean closure.
Closure is
what we seek.
Hey, put the camera down,
man. Watch the road.
No, not till Nicole
says it and means it.
I love you.
Seriously, when was the last time
that we passed
a rest stop
or a gas station?
I need to pee so bad.
Well, we would've
been there already
if we didn't have to wait
on you two jackrabbits
all morning.
For the 10th time,
we slept in.
Uh-huh. You know,
ever since you got
so serious about her,
you started holding
out on all the details.
That's weak sauce,
bro. Weak sauce.
He's a gentleman
way beyond his years.
Thank you, baby.
And, Brent, tell me,
do I ask you about you
and Amber all the time?
What do you wanna know?
She shaves, I shave.
It's a freak show
from head to toe.
Brent, enough.
Bathroom's
on the right.
Brent, my boy,
I love this
fucking house, dude.
In case you
didn't notice.
Motherfucker.
Hey, Freddy,
hottie stepsister
at 12 o'clock.
I'm not hooking up
with Brent's sister.
That is disgusting.
Step. Stepsister, okay?
I know that's got
a little bit of a
redheaded, pasty sound to it,
but she don't look
too red and she
don't look too pasty.
You are tapping her ass.
So, I didn't know
you were coming
this weekend.
Didn't know it was my job
to tell you when I'm
staying at my house.
If you got
friends coming, sorry,
the rooms are occupied.
Not all of us
travel in herds.
I'm here alone
soaking up solitude.
Doing the weird-girl thing.
Mmm-hmm.
What's up?
What's up?
That was Alex.
Yo, if it helps,
Nicole and I will sleep
on that outside porch.
A little outdoor loving.
Carlos-style, baby.
Hey, sexy.
Magic bag
got you jumpy?
Don't go all
Dr. Phil on me.
If it wasn't safe,
they wouldn't
prescribe them.
Student Health
Services prescribes
anything. You know that.
Especially
on Tuesdays
and Thursdays.
Dr. B. loves the
belly button ring.
I'll bet he does.
The story is
you messed around
with my girlfriend
and she couldn't
handle your size.
Please, just don't embarrass me, guys.
Tell them, Freddy,
you don't need their help.
She'd be lucky to have you.
I'm Jennifer.
Hey, I'm Alex.
Great to meet you.
Hi, I'm Freddy.
Way to be, Dad!
Don't let my boy's
physique fool you here,
he's got a heart of gold.
The girls at school
call him Freddy Bear.
FYI, tornado
between the sheets.
They're lying.
Freddy, grilling is
your specialty, right?
Do a favor and
get it started.
I'll play bartender
if you show me that
black steel, right now.
Dock bar is officially open.
What are you
looking at?
I can't believe
Brent's dad trusts
him with all this.
Uh, I think Brent's dad has
more toys and homes than he
knows what to do with. So...
Bet Amber loves that.
Be nice.
So? 
So?
So, how long have
you had your hog?
My hog?
A year.
Cool. I'm, you know...
I think I got it.
Everybody's hooked up,
right? Yeah.
You're alone
and I'm alone.
I'm gonna make this
real simple, though.
You look like
a really nice guy,
but I don't do
the nice guy thing.
I never even slept
with a teddy bear
when I was young.
Anyway, I'm set up
in the bedroom and
you're on the couch.
It's great
to meet you.
Fair enough.
This is sick.
Don't tell me you are not nailing a full
menu of bitches on this boat.
This boat does treat me well.
This way.
Okay, be careful.
This is so gangster.
I'm like
Tony Montana.
Oh! Jesus.
Dude, why don't you
just keep it in the house?
'Cause of drunk shitheads
like you, that's why.
Let me just shoot it once.
Tomorrow, okay? When
we go out on the boat,
you can shoot it.
I swear it's like
the fucking definition
of boondocks
when you can't even
get a text out.
Will you?
Come on,
we're all adults.
You know, the last time
we did this was on that
cruise we took freshman year.
Yeah, that was
a fun trip.
You're a liar.
I bitched
the entire time
because you didn't take me
to Cancun to do the whole
spring break thing.
Yeah, you did.
Little lower.
Looking back, though,
I realized it was the best
spring break I ever had.
I can't believe we're
going to graduate, huh?
Oh, God, please don't talk.
Why, you don't
want to graduate?
No, it's not that.
It's just you
get towards the end
and you realize that
you didn't get
everything you wanted.
You weren't mature enough
to realize the important
things sooner.
Amber.
Relax, I was just kidding.
We don't play
those games anymore.
We haven't for a while. So...
Last summer qualifies
as a while?
We'd been drinking for 10 hours.
It was a drunken mistake.
You know this.
Come on,
let's go hang out
or something. Jesus!
Prairie fire shots?
Yeah.
Snake and Jake's
tradition.
I swear, whoever thought
151 in Tabasco sauce made
a good drink should be killed.
It's a puke drink, that's the point.
Freddy, burger
patties made yet?
No, I'm just,
you know, cleaning...
Yeah, well, the shit
has to marinate.
All right.
Thanks, bro.
No.
What?
Don't tell me you're
gonna throw big boy
a charity fuck.
What is that? Some sort of "quasi brother protection"?
Alex, I actually
think your mom
seems nice.
But just 'cause she happened
to be standing next to
my dad at the craps table
on a night he just happened
to be tossing sevens
doesn't exactly
make us family.
That's cool.
'Cause to me your dad is
just rich guy number five.
Cheers, bro.
Do you remember
the girl Freddy was
talking to last weekend?
Yes, the brunette
at the house party.
Yup.
At the end of the night, she
blew Brent in the bathroom.
Poor Amber.
More like poor Freddy.
I mean, I know
you're roommates
with Amber and everything,
but it's not like Brent
has stealth game.
She has to know.
Hey, at least his dad's
house is tight, right?
"Hey, bro, can you make me, like,
a hamburger, huh?"
God, he's such an asshole.
"Bro, can you, like, fix me,
like, a hamburger, bro?"
Like... Fix you, fix you.
Now, how about a little
hot sauce to marinate?
And a dash of salt.
That's good. That
should taste good, huh?
Enjoying your eats, FB?
This is the best burger ever.
How's yours?
All you fucking
booze hounds.
Then you're
up,  La Bamba.
Someone's getting limp over
Brent's whiskey dick.
Yeah, I'm not
going to be the one
with the little
whiskey dick after
you eat that shit.
Hey, leave some.
Oh! Jeez.
I'll show you how
it's done here,
baby. Ready?
All right, I'm gonna follow her.
Assuming that
that's possible.
That's my man.
Attaboy.
Oh, my God.
Would you get a room,
you two? Man.
Let's go upstairs after this
and get away from everybody.
Well, you know I'm
doing the toast thing.
So, do it.
I'll do it later.
I brought the handcuffs.
Everyone, listen up.
Since we're all
about to graduate
and most of us will be in
different cities next year,
I figured a toast
was in order.
Not a bad idea.
Jennifer, I don't think
I ever told you this.
But all of us
were so psyched
when you came along,
because the girl
that Mikey was
dating before you...
No, leave it alone.
What?
Boy! Take it.
You fucker.
What about her?
Let's just say
she had freakishly short
arms.
T. rex. "Mikey, I can't
reach your pants. Mikey."
Thanks for
bringing it up.
I appreciate it.
I can't believe I'm
about to admit this,
but first time I ever
saw you was at Shamrock's.
You were wearing
that little white top
with those
jeans with the tear
in the perfect spot.
Easy access.
Oh, my God.
And all I remember
is just being
incredibly nervous
because I knew I had to
come up and talk to you.
I just... I had to.
But I had no
idea what to say.
I guess what I'm really
trying to say is that it's
been a great four-year ride.
And I just want all
of you to know that
I couldn't have traveled
it with better people.
I mean that.
Fuck, yeah.
Love you guys.
Yeah, absolutely.
Cheers.
I just teared up.
I just teared up
a little.
Whoa, hold the phone.
Cheers.
I know I didn't go to
school with you guys,
but can I add something...
Absolutely.
...anyway? Is that cool?
Please.
Sure?
Thanks. Aye, here's to
my fast bike, fast men
and getting bent sideways
with a bunch of fucking
yuppie college motherfuckers.
Yes,  salud.
We're all high.
Let's get more.
Let's do this.
Then the wine.
The more, the merrier.
We gotta drink that.
Who shit in my shot glass?
You like that "to kill ya"?
It tastes like old-man urine.
I got you. I got you.
Oh!
Go soft, baby.
No.
You are so
fucking beautiful.
And I'm so
fucking lucky.
And I've seen enough.
Oh. It's on, mama.
You got a one-way ticket
south before we go there,
okay, babe?
All right, you saucy little minx.
Baby?
What the fuck
did you do, man?
What just happened?
I didn't do anything!
Help me move her.
What the hell?
What the fuck happened?
Just fucking
move her. Fuck!
My God,
you motherfucker!
Baby!
What the fuck?
Is that fucking...
Are you fucking
kidding me?
Oh, my God.
What happened?
We gotta call someone.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my fucking God.
Are you fucking kidding me?
There's no dial tone!
Fuck the phone.
Somebody block
the window now.
I'm going to try and call out.
I'm so sorry.
What happened?
What the fuck happened?
I don't know.
Somebody must be outside.
Hello? Hello?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Oh, my God,
what the fuck
does that say?
"TV."
Turn it on.
I love you.
Oh, jeez. Look at her.
Why's he giving her a gun?
Please, please, please.
Oh, my God, Carlos.
No, I can't. I really...
What is he doing?
You can do it, Nicole.
Who the fuck is that?
Just squeeze the trigger.
What the fuck?
Turn around, turn around.
She saved you, Carlos.
These were my best friends.
If you had asked me
when I took this picture
if I could kill them,
I'd have said,
"Not possible."
But I did.
Nicole had the same
options that you all have.
The choice to end
someone else's life
to save your own.
Certain death now confronts
everyone in the house.
There is only one way out,
kill your friends
or die with them.
Turn it off.
Turn it off.
Turn it off.
If you run, you're dead.
Turn it off.
At 6:00 a.m.,
if one person is
alive, they go free.
But if 6:00 comes
and more than one is
alive, everybody dies.
What the fuck?
How could you
not hear them?
I was drunk
and passed out!
Brent!
Brent, what are
you looking for?
My dad has a rifle.
Now you say so?
Not now,
trailer park.
Go screw yourself,
frat boy.
Screw you.
Hey, get the rifle.
Oh, Jen.
Yeah, I'm okay.
Rifle's gone.
It's gone?
Are those of us?
What the hell?
This was two months ago.
Is he following you guys?
He's been stalking us.
The rifle was your first move.
I also know your
second and third moves.
Now look around.
Oh, my God.
Who do you trust the most?
Your boyfriend?
Your girlfriend?
Who do you trust the least?
The narcissist? The outsider?
Perhaps the guy
that puts Tabasco
in a friend's burger?
Over the next three
hours you'll learn that
all of you have
the will to survive.
Escaping me is impossible,
so start thinking about
how to escape each other.
Only one can go home.
What are we gonna do?
What about a
neighbor's phone?
We can start a fire.
We could set a fire
to something. The fire
department has to come.
Listen to me,
there's no one
for 50 miles.
Jesus.
Well, why don't
we just leave?
Brilliant. He's
probably perched
up in a tree
with my dad's rifle,
which happens to have
a fucking laser
scope, by the way!
Hey! All right, we're gonna...
We'll block the doors
and then we'll set a trap
in case he tries
to get into the house.
Fuck this.
Carlos, will
you calm down?
No, I'm not going to sit here
and wait for some
psycho to ass-rape us.
He has a gun.
We do, too.
Carlos.
No, dude.
He's going to
get my handgun.
Hello,
is anybody there?
Shit.
Hello, can anybody
hear me? Hello?
What do we do?
All right,
forget what that
bastard said, okay.
He's just trying
to freak us out
and make us separate.
Now, we're gonna go,
we're gonna lock
the doors,
we're gonna lock the
windows and we'll wait
for the boys to get back.
Yeah? All right, let's go.
Front checked.
Carlos, wait up!
Carlos. Carlos, stop.
Carlos, what are you doing?
Carlos, stop.
The fucking key.
I gotta get the...
You're not getting that key,
man. Look at the boat.
It is 10 feet under water.
Look, stand up.
What the fuck
can we do?
Come on, man! Come on!
Fuck! Fuck!
Open up.
Get it open. Fuck!
This isn't going
to stop him.
But it'll make noise
if he tries to come in.
Fucking help me, man!
Help me!
Hang on, hang on.
Hang on, hang on.
God!
Come on!
Don't shoot,
don't shoot.
I'm sorry, man.
We got to get
out of here, man.
We got to get
the hell out of here.
We can't leave
without them!
They might not
even come back.
Dude, that's so harsh.
Oh, we're so fucked.
Man. This is it, man.
We're all going to die,
dude, seriously.
Why are we just
standing here?
Shh!
Relax. Please.
Maybe he's right.
Maybe we should just go
to the van and leave.
Baby, we have to give
them more time, okay?
Amber, come away
from the window.
Come here.
He'll come back.
Where is Carlos?
Shut the door!
Where is Carlos!
He's dead.
He's fucking dead.
I found him in
some big-ass trap
or something.
Wait, a trap!
What do you mean a trap?
Like, does your dad own
a bear trap or something?
No, he doesn't
own any bear traps.
Doesn't own any
human traps, either.
Oh, God.
No, I've got to
get out of here.
Slow down. You're
not going outside.
Oh, God, this is bad,
man. This is bad.
This is really bad.
Oh, God.
Where did you put
the fucking key?
You had it last.
Oh, damn it.
Let me just
think a second.
What is this shit?
Of all the fucking places,
this guy chooses my place?
What the fuck is that?
I know that look.
What look?
You didn't tell us
everything that
happened out there.
Maybe it's the "I just
saw my best friend
bleed to death" look.
It's how I know
when you cheat on me.
Not now, Amber.
It's our little game.
I ask where you've been
and you make something up.
You give half the truth
because that's what
good liars do.
You just leave the part
out about the girl.
But you still have that look
of not telling everything.
I'm alone in this house.
There is a fucking killer
out there and I'm alone
in this house.
Hey.
Look, I may not be
Joe Boyfriend or whatever,
but I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.
I wanted to talk alone.
I don't trust Brent
with that gun.
Baby, Brent can be
a cocky asshole sometimes,
but he's not gonna shoot us.
All I know is that
two people went outside.
Only one came back.
I don't know. I'm too busy
thinking about how you and
I are gonna get out of this.
That's so wrong.
We're so fucking fucked.
God, I'm so right.
I'm fucked, you're
fucked, they're fucked...
Dude, dude!
Freddy! Block it out.
Come sit.
Come here, come here.
We are so
fucking fucked.
Freddy, we could
die tonight,
so why don't you and I
go into one of these
rooms and get busy?
It could be our
last chance. Hmm?
Seriously?
No, but at least I got
you thinking about
something else, huh?
Why don't you keep
your shit together?
You want to know what I didn't
tell the others?
He sunk my boat.
He let you have
the gun because he
wants you to use it.
Like Nicole.
Maybe.
Who cares?
We sit in a corner,
we stay away
from the windows,
and if that sick fuck comes
in here, I'll kill him.
Promise you won't let
anything happen to me.
Of course.
Hey, a month from now,
we'll be drinking
$2 pitchers at Shamrock's.
How can you read?
I'm trying to
keep my mind off it,
and unless you want to walk
through this dark-ass house
and help me find
my pill bag, this is
the best that I can do.
Why are you all so calm?
Can everyone stop
breaking my shit?
We are just sitting
here waiting to be killed!
Freddy, Freddy,
you need to calm down.
We don't even know if
he's still out there.
Yeah, sure, Barbie.
You think he sends us a tape
to tell us we're
fucking toast for kicks?
If we stay here,
I know we'll die.
I can feel it. Okay?
So, we gotta
go to the van.
And we got to get out of here.
Yes.
Yeah. Yeah, and the guy
that sent America's
freakiest home video
didn't think about doing
something to the van.
We have to at least try.
I know it's fucked up.
We're just fucking
sitting here!
It's okay to be scared.
We're all scared.
Freddy,
we've got you.
No, no, I gotta go. I gotta
get out of here.
Yeah, like you're
gonna leave. Sit down!
You're freaking
out the girls.
Listen. Hey,
look at me.
All right.
Our best chance is
to stick together.
I promise you this.
No, we gotta get
out of here, man.
Freddy, this is
what he wants.
He wants us to
panic. You're having
a panic attack.
You're having one of
your panic attacks.
No.
Look at me. Breathe.
No, I can't breathe.
No. Get off me.
I'm fucking suffocating.
Oh, my God!
Is he out there?
Is he fucking
out there?
Oh, God! He bandaged him up
and brought him back here.
This is so messed up.
You said that
he was dead.
Back off me.
What happened in
the boat house?
I thought he was dead.
I am not
a fucking doctor.
All right. We need to
get him to a hospital
right now.
Yeah, sure, I'll
call an ambulance.
What is wrong with you?
Look at him. You think
he's gonna make it
even if we do go?
You guys, if we
don't leave right now,
he's going to die!
You guys,
can't we just get
out of here, man?
I guarantee you
this psycho wants
us to go to the van.
It is the first thing
he would have thought of.
Brent, if I take him
myself, will you just
give me the gun?
No way.
My God. Fuck you.
Brent left me.
Did he say anything?
Baby, what's going on?
Fuck! Shit!
Jennifer,
what the fuck?
Carlos said
Brent left him.
Of course I left him.
I thought he
was dead. Fuck!
All right, listen, anyone
who wants to stay here
till morning can do so.
Jennifer and I are
gonna bring Carlos
to the hospital
because if we don't,
he's gonna die.
And if you don't like that,
you can go fuck yourself.
I'm going, too.
I'm getting the van.
I'm gonna pull
it up to the porch,
but I'm not doing
it without the gun.
No, we give her the gun,
she never comes back.
She hits the road
and we're left holding
our collective dicks.
Brent's right,
we should think
about this.
There's no time.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Be careful.
When she gets back,
you take the gun
while I go get Carlos, okay?
You stay close to me
no matter what, all right?
All right, smart guy,
we'll just sit here
and wait for her
to turn the van keys
so we can all hear
the very loud boom.
No more sis, no more gun.
Now, when the van comes, you
grab his legs and I'll grab
him under his arms, okay?
We just got
to be careful.
He's so cut up.
Mikey, we're boys.
Do you really think
this is a good idea?
I'm not gonna
watch him die.
Fine, but you're
the one who's about
to get us all killed.
Fuck!
God!
Come on. This way.
Aren't you coming?
Hurry. Let's go.
I got it.
I got him.
Just watch
his left foot...
Okay, hang on.
I'm sorry.
It's okay, it's okay.
Brent.
Come on!
Take the gun.
Stay awake.
All right?
We're out, we're out.
Oh, my God.
Now what
did we hit?
 I don't know.
You gotta rock it.
You gotta...
I don't know. I am!
I'm trying!
What did I fucking
tell you, man?
Fuck!
Fuck this.
Imagine you're hanging from a rope.
One minute, rock climbing,
the next minute,
staring at certain death.
The line was splitting above
because it couldn't hold
everyone's weight.
I was closest to the top.
Do I take the knife
from my belt?
Do I cut them loose?
I stared down below
and everything became
so still, so perfect.
And then I cut.
One by one
their screams faded,
and hers was last to go.
And I survived.
I had 10 seconds to
find my primal core.
You have until 6:00 a.m.
Right now you
cut someone loose.
Send one person outside.
You have 60 seconds.
Holy shit!
Oh, God!
What the fuck?
It's gasoline.
Fifty seconds.
Leave us alone!
You give me that
fucking gun right now!
Brent!
Brent, settle down!
God damn it!
Stop fighting!
All right, I'm gonna
fire out shots.
Everybody run for the
trees and you go in
different directions.
We're dead if we try that.
Oh, my...
Forty seconds.
Fuck this.
Don't you even
fucking think it!
He is fucking
dead already.
We're going to
fucking burn, man! We
are all going to burn!
He'll fucking
kill us anyway!
No, no, he won't.
If we do this
for him, he won't.
Thirty seconds.
He's lost
a lot of blood.
Freddy!
He's our friend.
Michael, look at her.
Look at her.
She is going to die.
Don't you fucking
talk to me about Jennifer.
Look at her!
Twenty seconds.
Baby.
Fifteen seconds.
Ten, nine...
Eight, seven,
six, five,
four, three,
two, one.
Fuck this! No!
Mikey.
Run! Run!
Run!
We're taught to bury it,
but it's primal.
Deep down,
we're all killers.
I tried to
tell you guys.
He's thought
of everything.
This van, that gun,
everything.
I mean, did you think
he was gonna let us leave?
You quit talking like
you know this fucking guy.
You quit fucking
talking like that!
Are you going
to shoot me?
Are you going
to shoot me?
Not gonna fucking
shoot you, you motherfuck.
I'm gonna run.
If he doesn't shoot,
fucking follow me.
Don't leave me.
Brent! No!
All right, you take
the gun, you go back.
I'll meet you there.
I'll meet you there.
What? No! No!
Fuck! What
are you doing?
Come on!
Go!
Freddy!
Freddy, open the door!
Freddy, open the door!
Freddy, come on!
Open the door!
Freddy, come on!
Freddy! Freddy!
Come, come. Go, go in.
No, no, no.
No. Please, no. Please.
There is no escape.
Only the choice
between dying with
friends or living alone.
Decide.
We let Carlos die?
It was the
only choice.
Where's Alex?
She tried to run.
He shot her.
And Brent?
He left me.
Fuck you!
You fucking back-stabbing
piece of shit!
Fuck!
You see?
Do you fucking see?
What are we
gonna do?
I don't know.
We can all
figure this out.
Jennifer.
Why don't we just go?
It's not like
he's gonna be
watching all of us.
You know we
can't do that.
What's gonna happen
at 6:00? Are you even
thinking about that?
We should leave now.
I have a gun. I'm not
gonna let anything
happen to us.
So, just try
and calm down. Okay?
Okay? Okay.
Give me that.
You know, the
way you wigged
out earlier,
I figured you got
it before I did.
Got what?
That we're alone.
And that's why we die.
Outside there's a guy
who gets off making
us kill each other.
Inside,
our friend Michael
has a gun.
And he's the best man
that I've ever met.
It's exactly
the reason I know
we're both gonna die.
You're not
making any sense.
At 6:00, a choice
will have to be made.
Who do you think
Michael's gonna choose?
He's already choosing
Jen over me.
Do you really think
he's gonna pick you?
He'll pick Jen
over himself, Freddy.
Their love is
gonna kill us both.
Don't say that!
Idiot, you're sitting
next to an open window.
Talk quietly.
I thought
you left us.
I never leave my crew,
especially after
I found a way out.
What?
The boat.
Probably rigged
that, too.
I checked it.
All he did was
take the keys,
but I have an extra set.
I mean, he must not know that.
Okay, I gotta
go get Michael.
No.
There is no time for
a group discussion on this.
We have to act.
No. Let go of me.
No.
You've seen the way
Michael's behaving?
He has the gun,
he calls all the shots.
What if he doesn't want to go?
Yeah, but if we tell
him about the boat...
We can't chance it.
As long as he has the gun,
he makes all the decisions.
I'm not leaving them.
We're not leaving anyone.
Everyone goes.
We just need the gun
to have the final say.
That's all.
Jennifer doesn't trust me,
which means Mikey
doesn't trust me.
I can't get close
enough to the gun.
But they trust you, Freddy.
Everyone in this house
needs your help.
You said it yourself.
If we stay, we die.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
I really can't.
Do you want to live?
Freddy, do you want to live?
Amber, where's Freddy?
I guess he wanted
to be alone.
Mikey.
Mikey.
Hey.
Freddy.
Do you remember
freshman year
when those guys were
making fun of me?
And you stuck up for me.
You didn't even know that
we were roommates yet.
Yeah, I remember.
I just...
I just really want
you to know that
I appreciated that.
Listen, buddy.
Hey, no saying
goodbyes, all right?
I'm so sorry.
That's it, Freddy.
No, Amber.
Stay back,
stay back.
That's it,
bring it to me.
Give me the gun!
 No.
Now, Freddy!
Don't give him the gun.
No, I got the gun
and we're going to the boat.
Brent told me
that the boat sunk.
No, what I was
saying is that...
Just don't
even start!
Look, Freddy...
I said don't!
I'm really
scared, Mikey.
I know you are.
I know you are.
But we're all
scared shitless, man.
This isn't the way.
Fuck me. Fuck me!
Fuck me!
I shouldn't even be here!
The only reason I'm here
is because I was
matched up in the dorm
with you guys
freshman year.
That's it.
That doesn't happen.
I'm some dude you guys
make fun of at parties.
Now that is not true!
And you know it.
You're just telling yourself
that to convince yourself
to do this. Stop!
Yeah?
Freddy.
What happens if
morning comes, huh?
What happens if we're boxed
in and you have choose
between us and Jennifer?
You know that's
not gonna happen.
That's not what I said!
I said what if.
What if that happens?
That's right, Freddy.
That's why he can't
make the decisions.
Now give me the gun.
Oh, please!
Like I didn't know
you were going to
shoot every one of us!
What are you
talking about?
Just because you fucked
more girls than me does
not mean you're smarter.
As a matter of fact,
you are a fucking moron.
I could have left,
but I came back.
I came back for you.
Now give me the gun.
Give me the gun,
you fat fuck!
How did it feel last week?
What?
Come on!
You don't know what
I'm talking about?
Come on.
How did it feel?
What are you fucking
talking about?
I bet you don't
even know her name.
But you had to have
her blow you, right?
You had to.
You just had to
have her blow you
so everyone would know that
you're stronger and I am weak.
Give me a fucking break.
Give me the gun.
Well, how do you
feel now, huh?
Do you feel weak, hmm?
Do you feel insecure?
Like the fucking fat kid.
Fuck you!
What are you
gonna do, huh?
You going to kill
us all, Freddy?
No, tough guy,
just you!
Fuck.
Freddy.
Freddy.
Freddy, Freddy,
don't shoot.
Just leave, man.
Come on, just go.
Just go, all right?
God, Freddy!
Come morning,
I'm the only one
here with this gun.
You hear me?
Just me and this gun!
Now leave.
If you make us leave,
it's just like
shooting us yourself.
I don't want
to die, man.
I know you don't.
Michael.
Baby, it's all right.
It's okay.
Freddy's not gonna shoot us
because Freddy is our friend.
Carlos was
our friend, too!
Leave!
Leave!
Jen, sit.
Get out!
You said it yourself.
We're on our own.
No, Freddy.
What I said is we're
both going to die.
Mikey! I want
you to leave.
I want you to leave.
Freddy.
If you want us to go away,
you're gonna have to come
here and shoot us.
Please.
Please, just go!
You come in here and you
look me in the fucking
eye and pull the trigger.
Baby, don't.
It's okay.
Freddy, you're like
a brother to me.
And you're freaked out
right now. We all are.
Freddy.
Freddy, that
is not the way.
That's right, Freddy.
It's okay.
I told you to give
me the gun, fat fuck.
Yo, Mikey.
Come out now,
I'll let you leave.
But if not,
I will come in there.
Is there a way out of here?
Can you find the light?
Fuck! Fuck, open!
Over there.
All right, when we get
outside you run and you
don't look back, all right?
You run, you go for
the motorcycle. Okay?
Come on.
All right, stay low. Whichever way
he goes, we go opposite.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
You just...
You can't
do this.
It's the only way, bro.
Survival of the fittest.
All right, give us
a chance to say
goodbye to each other.
You owe
me that.
You are my boy.
And I'm sorry it's
gotta go like this, but...
Not you, you
narcissistic prick!
You got 10 seconds.
I'm going
to rush him.
No, he'll kill you.
Gives you a chance.
You get that gun.
I'm sorry.
I really am.
Cheat on this, motherfucker!
Oh, Jesus!
Are you okay?
I'm just...
Amber?
Let's go.
Amber, come on.
Come on.
It's so fucked up!
Don't look.
What are we
going to do?
It's almost 6:00.
We're going to
back into a corner
with the gun. Come on.
No, that's not working.
What about Amber?
What about her? I don't
think she's coming out
of that basement.
And what if she does?
What are we going
to do, shoot her?
What?
Did you not see
what she did to Brent?
I saw her save
our lives. Yes...
We can't trust
her anymore.
This guy can't
stop bullets,
all right?
What we need to do
is back into a corner.
That's our best chance.
Back into a corner,
wait for him to come to us.
You're not
listening to me!
We have to make
a run for it.
You saw what
happened to Alex
when she tried that.
This guy is out there.
Baby, he can see
what we're doing.
We can't stay
here anymore!
Listen, please, Jen.
If we go outside, we die.
If we stay in here,
we fucking die!
Michael,
get down!
What the fuck
are you doing?
Where'd you
get that gun?
I found it.
What do you
mean you found it?
I fucking found it.
Stay calm,
both of you. Just...
You were about to
point it at Michael.
Put it down.
Put yours down.
I wouldn't shoot him.
He's the only
reason I came back.
Everyone put their guns down.
Everyone put their guns down!
We all pretend like
it's not true. We all
know that I love him.
That's why I'm all
fucked up on pills.
It's not my fault
you love him.
This is not
the time for this.
I love you and I
know that I fucked up,
but it's torture seeing you
with somebody else.
Put it down.
Jennifer, she's not
going to shoot us. Just...
Amber. Amber.
Put the gun down and
then we'll talk. Okay?
Okay?
I know that you love me, too.
Since when,
freshmen year?
Jennifer!
You think what you have
with him is so special?
Not true.
If you really loved her,
you wouldn't have
secrets with me.
Amber.
Are you talking about last summer?
He confessed the next day.
We got over it.
He doesn't love you, Amber.
Amber, give me the gun.
Amber, don't.
Give me the gun.
Well, I guess
that's it then.
Amber, put
the gun down.
She's the girl
that guys marry
and I'm the girl
that guys fuck!
God!
Oh, God.
I had to, right?
Hold on.
She was going
to shoot you.
What are you doing?
He was just there.
Come on,
the basement.
Michael. Michael,
come on.
Michael, come on!
We shouldn't be here.
We shouldn't be here.
We still have a chance
and she doesn't.
This is the best chance
for all three of us.
Get behind me.
Shoot.
We need to wait.
Shoot.
Keep coming fucker,
keep coming.
You got him.
No!
No! God!
Jennifer, we need to go.
We need to go, come on.
Jen, I need your help.
I need your help.
There's no
time for this.
Michael.
Jennifer, listen to me.
He's going to kill us both.
No matter what happens,
he can't touch this.
Look, I love...
I would have killed
myself for you.
It's the only way.
Jennifer.
I loved you so much.
Why couldn't
you see that?
I do see it.
I'm so sorry.
No.
No. No!
No! Stop.
No! No! No. No. No.
Finish it,
you sick bastard.
It is finished.
You go through all of this
to try to prove something.
But there's one thing
you never considered.
You were crazy before
you cut that rope.
And you know what?
I will never be
anything like you.
We'll see.
This is Dr. Karl Truftin.
You've reached
my personal office line.
Leave a message.
Hello, Doctor. I want to talk
to you personally.
I have a new chapter
for your book.
Remember when you
made me say others
wouldn't make
the same choice that I did?
You were incorrect.
Your son proved my theory.
You know what that is, Karl?
Closure.
