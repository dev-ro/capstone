Here!
- Wu.
- You and your brothers...
murdered three of our men.
He would have done the same.
Send three more and I'll kill them too.
He already controls
the opium trade all across Asia.
May no one prosper but Ying Ko?
My poppy fields are tiny.
Nothing compared to his.
Well, l, Li Peng-- at least
I'm entitled to my little piece.
Ying Ko, if you kill me,
I promise...
my brothers
will come for you.
And I promise you...
I'll bury them
beside you.
Kill him.
[ Groaning ]
Let me go.
I only wish to leave.
I'll cut his throat.
Your men are not marksmen enough
to shoot around him.
You're right.
You're right.
Wu, you are
a wonderful friend.
- Like a father to me.
- Thank you, Ying Ko.
- Shoot through him.

Do you have any idea
who you just kidnapped?
Cranston.
Lamont Cranston.
You know my real name?
Y es.
I also know that for as long
as you can remember...
you struggled against your own
black heart and always lost.
You watched your spirit,
your very face, change...
as the beast claws its way out
from within you.
You are in great pain,
aren't you?
You know what evil lurks
in the hearts of men...
for you have seen that evil
in your own heart.
Every man pays the price
for redemption. This is yours.
- I'm not looking for redemption.
- You have no choice.
You will be redeemed...
because I will teach you to use
your black shadow to fight evil.
I wouldn't do that.

- Is it dry?
- Please. [ Panting ]
- Perfect, Duke.
- Bring 'im to the rail.
I won't tell anyone.
I swear.
Geez.
[ Chuckles ] I wish I could
trust you, sport. I really do.
I guess you just picked
the wrong alley to look down.
- I have a family.
- [ Scoffs ] They'll get over it.
I won't talk. I'm telling you--

Oh, I know you won't.

- No. No!
- I hate heavy lifting.

No!
[ Disembodied Laughing ]
- What in Christ was that?

Show yourself, fella.
- [ Man's Voice ]
You murdered a policeman, Duke.
- Who said that?
Duke, who said that?
- Shut up!
- [ Man ] The weed of crime
bears bitter fruit.
I don't like this. This stinks.
Let's get the hell outta here!
- Shut your hole, Maxie!

you'd get away with it?

You're damn right l--
- [ Whooshing ]

You committed murder, Duke.
- Now you're going to confess to it.
- Like hell I will.
You will, Duke, because if
you don't, I'll be there.
[ Groans, Screams ]
I'll be there,
around every corner...
in every empty room as inevitable
as your guilty conscience.
You don't scare me,

and surrender yourself,
and you will do it now.

I'll do it!

You fellas are probably busy.
Just drop me off anywhere--
You're Dr. Roy Tam, a professor
in the science department at N.Y.U.
- Yes.
- I've saved your life, Roy Tam.
- It now belongs to me.
- It does?
You'll become
one of my agents...

all over the world.
Could l, uh...
ask my wife about this?
- No!
- [ Brakes Screech ]

-Mr. Shrevnitz here will instruct you...
in the way in which
I will contact you...
should I require your help.
When you hear one of my agents
say, 'The sun is shining'...
you will respond,
'But the ice is slippery.'
This will identify you
to each other. Do you understand?
The s-sun is shining.
But the ice is slippery.
Uh, tell me, one thing:
How did you know
what was happening to me?
How did you know who I am?

I heard rumors in the paper,
on the radio.
I thought it was just talk.
I didn't think he existed.
He doesn't. Get it?
Don't ever take it off.

Somebody who owes him
his life.
Somebody just like you.

You cast your spell on me and here
I am surrendering my soul
Oh-ooh, you're--
Sorry I'm late, Uncle Wainwright,
but there was a little, uh...
accident on the bridge.
Well, I didn't think
you wanted me to wait.
Incidentally, try the prime rib.
It's excellent!
- Your usual, Mr. Cranston.
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
You know, Lamont,
I'm, I'm very upset with you.
What is it this time?
What is it this time?
What is it every time?
You ask me to dinner and show up
an hour late. There's no excuse--
Uncle Wainwright,
I'm sorry, l, uh...
got caught up.
With what, for God's sake?
You don't do anything.
A man your age, it's unseemly.
At least pick a hobby or something.
Why am I talking
to the back of your neck?
Lamont? Lamont.
I'm sorry.
What were we talking about?
I've never meddled in your affairs,
going back to the time...
after the war when you disappeared
for some seven years.
I never asked questions then.
I'm not now.
[ Waiter ]
Excuse me, Police Commissioner Barth.
Urgent message for you, sir.
What's the matter? Cops and robbers
business slowin' down?
It's a report of that damned
Shadow character again.
I thought you said
he was only a rumor.
I'm sick of this Shadow business--
his meddling in police affairs.
This time tomorrow...
I'll put a task force on him.
You're not going
to appoint a task force.
No. Hell with him.
I'm not going
to appoint a task force.
You're not going
to pay any attention...
to these reports of the Shadow.
- lgnore them entirely.
- There is no Shadow.
There is no Shadow. If there were,
I'd be Eleanor Roosevelt.
[ Sighs, Groans ]
Where was l?
You were about to tell me
who she is.
[ Wainwright ]
That's Margo Lane.
Her father's a scientist
working for the War Department.
- What the hell do you see in her?
- [ Laughs ]
Uncle Wainwright,
are you sure you're not dead?
Not by a long shot.
Send a bottle of Mouton Rothschild,
1928, to that table.
[ Wainwright ]
Do yourself a favor.
Stay away from her.
She's strange.
She hears voices.
That's what they say.
Really?
Yes, I would like
a glass of the Mouton--
Rothschild, 1928.
- Yes.
- From the gentleman.
Gentleman?
Lamont Cranston.
May I sit?
- [ Glasses Clink ]
- You know,
it's the strangest thing,
but I have this...
sudden craving
for Peking duck.
That's so odd.
[ Sighs ]
I was thinking
the exact same thing.
Care to join me?
[ Speaking Chinese ]
You speak Chinese.
- Only Mandarin.
- Oh, well.
Aren't you
full of surprises.
Thank you.
I'm glad you like it.
- I had it made at Adrian's.
- Why did you just tell me that?
[ Laughs ]
Well, you just complimented me
on my dress just now. Didn't you?
No, I didn't.
But I was thinking it.
Oh! Now that hasn't happened
to me in a long, long time.
Since I was a little girl
with my cousin, Harry.
I could hear
what he was thinking--
just pick the thoughts right out
of his head before he said a word.
It was the strangest thing.
And I never was able--
Is something
bothering you?
Oh! No, no, no.
[ Laughing ]
- [ Laughs ]
- Not at all.
[ Sighs ]
Well, thank you.
I had a wonderful time.
I'm not sure I can recall
an evening as... stimulating.
Good night, Miss Lane.
Good night, Mr. Cranston.
I like her, boss. She's different
than your usual dames.
- More than even she knows.
- How's that?
She has abilities
she's completely unaware of.
No kidding?
You gonna see her again?
- No, it's much too dangerous.
- Dangerous for who?
For me, Moe.
For me.
[ Laughing ]
[ Gasps ]
Someone's coming.
- Well, what is it?
- That's just it, sir. I don't know.
I would have labelled it a mummy case
coming from Tibet like it did.
- Mummy cases come from Egypt.
- That's right. Exactly.
Besides, the thing is metal, which
made me think it was a sarcophagus.
No. Tibetan sarcophagi
were of stone.
What happened to the truckmen
who dropped it off?
Gone.
Well, it's obviously an incorrect
shipment. Call our customs broker and--
My God!
This is beautiful.
That is solid silver.
Nelson, help us
take the sides off.
[ Boards Cracking ]
- What does it say?
- It's Latin.
'Kha Khan
dei potestas in terra.
'The power of God
on Earth...
the seal of the emperor
of mankind.'
Oh, my God!
Temujin.
This is the silver coffin
of Temujin.
Who's Temujin?
The man who very nearly conquered
the globe eight centuries ago.
Well, how come
I never heard of him?
Temujin was
the birth name...
of Genghis Khan.
What was
the shipper's address?
It... didn't say.
Label just had
the country of origin.
Let me make
a telephone call.
Let me... help you.

don't open it.
No, sir.

I'm through with

I'm just doing some underwater
tests to check pressure.
Farley, I have told you a dozen times,
we are doing energy research.
I'm not interested in any military
application of the project.
[ Chuckling ]
So why'd you let
the War Department pay all the bills?
'Cause you talked me into it.
I just wanted enough money to finish.
Dr. Lane,
you don't think big.
If you'd only listen to me,
the world could be our oyster.
Oysters?
I get a rash from oysters.
[ Elevator Bell Rings ]
Oh! Margo.
What a beautiful dress.
And... such a...
clever neckline.
Excuse me, Mr. Claymore,
I'd like to see my father.
So...
when you gonna come down
and see my beryllium sphere?
I'm not interested
in your spheres, Mr. Claymore.
Margo.
You don't return
my calls anymore.
Well, that's not true.
- I never did return your calls.
- I know.
I can't imagine why.
It's because...
I don't like you.
What a fascinating woman!
[ Groans ]
Dad, I don't know how
you can work with that man.
Margo!
What a nice surprise.
- Hi.
- Hey, have you had your dinner?
- Yes, Dad. It's 2:00 a.m.
- Oh.
Dad, where did you
get this shirt?
Well, you said
I look good in green.
No, this is green,
that's red.
Hmm?
Red, green.
- Well, to me it's just a clean shirt.
- [ Laughs ]
Dad?
- Do you believe in telepathy?
- Mm-hmm.
I mean... do you believe that it can
exist between... certain people?
You mean mind reading? Well, of course
I don't, dear. I'm a scientist.
So strange.
I've always had this feeling
that there was this...
indescribable connection
out there...
just waiting for me.
And suddenly tonight,
there it was.
Well, that's nice, dear.
What was it?
It was a man.
And I'm probably
never gonna see him again.
But why not?
[ Sighs ]
I just know.
It was as though I could
sense what he was feeling.
[ Sighs ]
And now I'm completely
and utterly depressed.
Well, that's nice, dear.
[ Brakes Screech ]
Okay, that'll be $4.45.
- What are you doing?

reports police investigation of murder
at the Museum of Natural History.
Murder.
Agent advises inquiry.
- Understood.
- [ Clicks Machine Off ]
I saw you as taller.
- Who are you?
- Shiwan Khan.
Last descendant
of Genghis Khan.
You are naturally
deeply honored.
Don't feel obligated to introduce
yourself. I already know who you are.
Not this temporary version
of yourself.
I know who
you really are... Ying Ko.
I'm a great admirer.
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.
Please.
It is no more difficult for me to invade
your mind than it was this room.
May I sit?
You are hurting
my feelings, Ying Ko.
I should have thought
you would enjoy to meet another...
with the unique ability
to cloud men's minds.
- You were a student of the Tulku.
- Yes.
He spoke of you constantly.
But I'm afraid he wasn't able
to turn me quite as easily.
Hey, would you happen to have
some... American bourbon?
[ Chuckles ]
I have a bit of a taste for it.
- I'm happy to pay, of course.
- No, no.
Not at all.
[ Glasses Clinking ]
Say, you didn't happen
by any chance to, uh...
pay a visit to the museum
last night, did ya?
Mmm. A wonderful collection
of Tibetan tapestries.
[ Glasses Clink ]
[ Sighs ]
Oh, Ying Ko.
Grown men still
shiver at your name.
You are, I have to confess,
my idol.
Your raid on the village
of Barga? I studied it.
- How nice. You remember it.
- It rings a bell.
It was a masterstroke.
Swift, vicious and sudden.
What genius.
Uh-huh.
So, uh, what brings you
to the Big Apple?
My destiny.
Genghis Khan conquered half
of the world in his lifetime.
I intend to finish the job.
And, uh, how do you
plan to do that?
If I told you,
it wouldn't be a surprise.
I traveled to this country
in Genghis Khan's holy crypt...
to absorb his power.
In three days, the entire world
will hear my roar...
and willingly fall subject
to the lost empire of Sianking.
That is a lovely tie,
by the way.
- May I ask where you acquired it?
- Brooks Brothers.
- Is that midtown?
- 45th and Madison.
You are a barbarian.
Thank you.
We both are.
I know that inside you
beats a heart of darkness.
You dip into it every time
you put on that hat and cloak.
- [ Grabs coat ]
- Join me.
You are Ying Ko,
the butcher of Lhasa.
You... and only you...
deserve to be by my side.
Together, we'll pit armies
against one another like a chess game.
We'll collect our due of pain
and we'll wash our hands in blood.
Your mouth still waters
at real power.
I am offering you
a chance to take it back.
Be my partner,
Ying Ko.
That's not my name anymore.
But it is! Nevertheless,
still who you are, isn't it?
For the bourbon.
[ Khan ]
We will meet again, soon.
- The day of the mongol warrior...
- [ Mongols Chanting ]

[ Radio Announcer ]
Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. America.
Flash: Manhattan reels from yet
another report of the elusive Shadow--
I think they made up the Shadow so
people would listen to the radio more.
- What do you think, Roy?
- [ Radio ] Some say the Shadow is--
Roy?
Oh, well, it--
- [ Doorbell Ringing ]
- I'll get it.
Y es?
The sun is shining.
But the ice is slippery.
- You're an agent of the Shadow.
- Who?
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Right. Gotcha.
Well, what do you need?
I need a metal analysis
of this.
Bronzium.
The metal is bronzium.
I didn't think it existed,
but my God, here it is.
The ancient Chinese believe this was the
very stuff the universe was formed of.
- Where did it come from?
- I'm told it came from Sianking.
Ah, if you believed in legends,
it had to be Sianking.
They called it
the birthplace of the world.
Could bronzium conceivably be used
to make some sort of a weapon?
Theoretically... yes.
How?
Well, supposedly, it's very unstable
on the molecular level...
constantly
given to expansion.
Only the cell bonds hold it in check,
but if the bonds were ever breached--
- By an explosion?
- It wouldn't do it.
But if the power of the cell were
to turn on itself in an implosion...
the molecular imbalance
will be released...
and then you'll have
your explosion.
How big?
No man can say.
The breakdown would spread to all levels
of the cells' atomic construction.
Fashioned into a bomb,
it would be catastrophic.
I guess you'd call it...
an implosive/explosive
submolecular device.
Or an atomic bomb.
Hey, that's catchy.
But it would have to have a beryllium
sphere to contain the apparatus.
No other metal would enhance a blast.
In any case, it's all moot.
None of this
would be possible.
Unless...
some genius figures out...
how to design and make it.
The implosive device.
It would have to be
sort of a shell...
with tiny implosive charges
regularly spread over the surface.
Something like this.
Fortunately...
such a device
doesn't exist.

- Nothing we can do unless--
Unless what?
He blows himself up?

Y es, we've met.
Would you, uh,
care to join us?
Miss Lane, the fact that
your father is acting strangely...
I don't think really calls
for a police investigation.
I just wanna see him.
The War Department says...
he suddenly decided to take no visitors,
not even his own daughter.
Well, chances are he's working
on something top secret.
- It is a government project, you know.
- No, his project is harmless.
Energy research.
Some kind of implosive device.
Look, I know something's wrong.
I spoke to him on the phone.
He was distant,
confused, babbling.
He spoke to me
in Chinese.
[ Gulps ]
Waiter, waiter.
- He doesn't even speak Chinese!
- [ Wainwright ] I'm sorry, please.
Tomorrow, I'll send a policeman
over to the federal building.
He'll see your father and
everything'll be fine, all right?
[ Sighs ]
What's your opinion, Mr. Cran--
Excuse me.
Hmm?
Lamont!
Wait a second, Lamont. I wanted
to ask you about my father.
I have to go.
Ying Ko!
Who's Ying Ko?
- [ Gasps ]
- You will forget about me.
- Why would I do that?
- You will give me no further thought.

I want you to leave right now.
And there was only you.

- Go ahead. Look at them. Look at them.

- She's alive.
- Then she's a danger to you.
She now knows exactly who you are.
How long will you let her live?
How long before
your pure instincts take over?
I'm onto your plan. You still
don't have the beryllium sphere.
Without it,
you can't complete the bomb.
Besides, you know
I'm gonna stop you.
You Americans
are so arrogant.
You think your meaningless,
decadent country...
is the new cradle
of civilization.
Let me tell you something--
That's the U.S. of A.
you're talkin' about.
I am talking about
ruling the world!
I'd like to give you a name.
Leonard Levinsky.
Brilliant psychiatrist.
- You'll talk, he'll listen--
- You are boring me!
[ Shrieking ]
- Oh, that knife.
- Recognize it?
I took it from the Tulku.
No. No, no,
I correct myself.
I took it out of the Tulku
after I ran it through his heart.
When will you learn
to listen to your instincts?
Instincts?
I'll show you my instincts.
- [ Grunting ]
- [ Snarling ]
Never did master
the Phurba, did you?
Still expect it to respond
to brute force.
- Aah!
- [ Trigger Cocking ]
My Mongol warriors
aren't terribly bright...
but they are loyal.
Accept the truth.
There is no light without shadow.
And you and l
are that shadow.
[ Sighs ]
I would sooner destroy
a Rembrandt than kill you.
For the last time,
will you join me?
You cannot fool me.
You cannot defeat me.
- Your mind is an open book to me.
- Then learn how to read!
- Uuh!
- Weakling!
[ Shouting In Chinese ]
[ Crowd Gasping ]
[ Crowd Shouting ]
Tail 'em, Moe.
He's disappeared, boss.
Stop the car.
It's just an empty lot, boss.
I can't help that I know
what I know about you.
And I can't
forget it either.
It's late.
Sleep here if you like.
There are guest rooms.
But in the morning,
you should go.
I'm not afraid of you.
But I am.
[ Margo's Voice Reverberating ]
Lamont?
Lamont?
Lamont?
[ Screaming ]
[ Panting ]
Oh, my God.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Oh, God, I dreamed.
So did l.
What did you dream?
I was lying naked
on the beach in the South Seas.
The tide was coming up
over my toes.
The sun was beating down.
My skin was...
hot and cool
at the same time.
[ lnhales Deeply ]
It was wonderful.
What was yours?
I dreamed I tore all the skin off my
face and was somebody else underneath.
You have problems.
I'm aware of that.
I'll wait for you outside
while you get dressed.
Oh, that's okay.
You can stay.
Oh, these are
all rumpled.
Ah, well, there might be some things
in here that you could use, uh--
Yeah. This belonged
to, uh, my Aunt Rose.
- Oh, really?
- Very fashionable gal, that Rose.
- Kept her figure too.
- Ah, yeah.
Well, I've gotta run.
I've got a--
- Taxi waiting downstairs?
- Excuse me?
I sensed that's what you were
gonna say. It is, isn't it?
Yes.
Hey, this is getting easier
the more I'm around you.
You're like reading a book.
Thank you, but I won't
be needing that taxi.
Yes, you do.
I have a very important--
Great. I'll come with you.
- Last night we agreed--
- I didn't agree.
Do you mind if I get
one little sentence out here?
Last night we agreed you were
going to leave this morning.
No, you agreed I was going to leave.
I agreed to no such thing.
- We need each other.
- No, we don't.
- We have a connection.
- No, we don't.
How do you explain that
I can read your thoughts?
- My thoughts are hard to miss.
- And why is that?
- Psychically, I'm very well endowed.
- I'll bet you are.
Okay, so you don't need me, but I need
you, Lamont, to help me find my father.
And I am coming with you.
Okay.
[ Man ]
Empire State Building pennants.
Get your Empire State
Building pennants.
From there to... there.
That is just
the explosion.
The destruction will be...
incalculable.
- Get your pennants!
- Good.
- Ahh. What a beautiful day.
- [ People Chattering ]
- Nice dress, toots.
- [ Sailors Laughing ]
- Come on along and listen to--
- [ Sailor ] Get me down!
- [ Sailor ] Get me down!
- Bobby! What are you doin'?
- I have no idea! Get me down!
- Don't do it!
- Get me down from here!
- The lullaby of Broadway
Get me down! Get me down!
[ Screaming ]
[ Lamont ]
It's all falling
into place for me now.
Shiwan Khan needs a beryllium sphere
to complete the bomb.
-I wonder where he intends to find one?
-Beryllium sphere?
Beryllium sphere!
Farley Claymore!
-What's that?
-Farley Claymore, my father's assistant.
- He was working on a beryllium sphere.
- In your father's lab?
No, no, he was working on his own.
Uh, Mari-Tech labs, down on Southside.
- Good, very good.
- Get outta the way!
I got something else
I want you to do for me.
I was trailing Khan. I lost him on
the corner of Second and Houston.
There's something strange
about that vacant lot.
Find out what used to be there.
Second and Houston.
What about Farley Claymore?
Mr. Claymore's gonna receive
a little visit... from the Shadow.
- [ Shadow ] Farley Claymore!
- [ Gasps ] Who's there?
Where is the beryllium sphere,
Claymore?
Sphere?
What sphere?
Claymore, you idiot!
You're being manipulated.
Your mind is being controlled
by hypnosis.
My mind? Controlled?
Claymore, what have you done
with the sphere?
It's too late.
I loaded it on a truck.
Take me to it now!
[ Shadow Laughing ]
Who do you think you're gonna
shoot with that, Claymore?
[ Shadow Grunts ]
[ Laughing ]
No one controls
my mind, Shadow!
There's a new world order coming,
and I'm gonna be a king.
A king!
[ Grunts ]
[ Thinking ]
Margo.
Margo, I need you.
[ Gasping ]
[ Screaming ]
You called?
[ Lamont Moaning ]
Lamont?
[ Gasping ]
[ Gasps ]
You're not
supposed to be here.
[ Yelling ]
[ Margo ]
Lamont?
You were dreaming.
You saw.
You have any idea...
what it's like to have done things
you can never forgive yourself for?
Lamont...
whoever you were...
whatever you did...
it's in the past.
Not for me, Margo.
Never for me.
[ Mongols Chanting ]
We are victorious!
And as victors, we will collect
the spoils of war.
I will remember
each of you...
particularly
my special servant...
the only American
with genius enough...
to join me
of his own free will...
- Oh, Khan.
- [ Chuckling ]
who saw himself a king
in my kingdom.
King?
Did I say king?
- Maybe not the best choice of words.
- No, it wasn't.
Because actually,
I was thinking prince, tops.
Not even, necessarily.
Uh, duke? Baron?
- Your choice, of course, your choice.
- Hmm!
- Get Dr. Lane. Assemble the bomb.
- Of course.
In the name
of the new Kha Khan!
The power of God
on Earth.
The emperor of mankind.
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!
Madman threatens
to blow the city sky-high!
[ Static ]
Residents of New Y ork City were
thrown into a virtual panic today.
Police were still trying to determine
if in fact the threat was real...
or merely
an incredible hoax.
Either way,
surely the work of a madman.
Morning, Russell.
He's demanded works of art,
famous jewels, even gold.
Find Khan and you'll find
the bomb, I bet.
What did you find out
about that vacant lot?
Not much, I'm afraid. It was
the site of the old Hotel Monolith.
It was finished nearly ten years ago,
but it never opened.
The Monolith.
I vaguely remember that.
Seems that's the only way
anybody remembers it.
Before the hotel
was completed...
the developer went bankrupt
and committed suicide.
- Ah.
- The last record is a sale...
to a Far Eastern buyer
six years ago.
- When was it torn down?
- It doesn't say.
I made some calls this morning
to newspapers and such.
All anybody can remember
is up to the time it was sold.
Everyone seems to know
that it was torn down...
but they can't remember
when or by whom.
Or if.
I can't believe he did it.
Did what? Lamont?
My God.
It's beautiful.
What is?
Hey, fella. That building right there.
What's the name of that building?
Lunatic!
Shiwan Khan has hypnotized
the entire city.
They don't see it.
None of them see it.
But I see it.
You and Shrevnitz
will receive your instructions.
- I want you to follow them exactly.
- Lamont!
[ Thunderclap ]
Bet you wish you'd been a little nicer
to me now, huh, don't ya?
Bet you wish
you'd listened to my ideas.
Bet you didn't count on me being friends
with the Conqueror, huh, did ya?
Hey, that's enough.
Activate the bomb.
[ Whirring Noise ]
Set the timer
for two hours.
You are certain you could duplicate
this bomb's design anytime I require?
Absolutely. No problem.
That makes Dr. Lane obsolete.
Secure him in a room.
He will die at the hands
of his own invention.
Y es, my Khan.
I know you must
have this covered...
but shouldn't we
be getting out of here too?
There's an aeroplane waiting to take us
all to safety. We leave in one hour.
- [ Doorbell Rings ]
- [ Thunderclap ]
What is it, Moe?
Is it another one of those things
from the bowlin' league?
Mm-hmm.
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
- Aah!
- Uuh!
[ Laughter Echoing ]
Ying Ko.
The Shadow! Where?
Not here, you idiot.
In the building.
Can you tell
if he's mad at me?
We had a little
misunderstanding yesterday...
and there might
still be hard feelings.
Find him...
and kill him!
Kill him? Me?
All of you!
Couldn't I just stay here
and help you?
Go!
[ Shadow Laughing ]
You guys... go that way.
[ Shadow ]
Did you think you'd never
see me again, Claymore?
[ Laughing ]
- [ Gasps ]
- I'm right here!
All around you.
Everywhere around you.
[ Laughing ]
[ Laughing ]
Coward.
Chicken! Sissy!
Come out here
and fight like a man.
[ Nervous Chuckling ]
You're a fool, Claymore.
- [ Gurgling ]
- Get out of my sight!
[ Babbling ]
- There's your exit, Claymore.
- [ Claymore Laughing ]
You know what I love
about this job?
The excitement.
Ah, Ying Ko.
I surrender.
You're finished, Khan.
[ Khan Laughing ]
Aah!
[ Shrieking ]
Phurba!
Aah!
[ Panting ]
Ooh! Aah!
[ Laughing ]
Ho! Aah!
[ Khan ]
You are losing
your concentration.
Your mind is too weak.
- You are beginning to lose your power.
- [ Shrieking ]
[ Roaring ]
Hyah!
- Look at you.
Can't even control yourself.
- [ Lamont Grunting ]
How can you hope
to control the Phurba?
[ Shrieking ]
- [ Shrieking ]
- [ Grunting ]
Stop!
Aaah!
Uh!
[ Margo Gasps ]
- My God.
- That's what he saw.
[ Screaming ]
Where am l?
[ Loud Scream ]
[ Groaning ]
[ Grunting ]
Aah!
Khan!
- Dad! Oh!
- Margo!
- Where am l? What is going on here?
- Are you all right?
- Well, there's this guy--
- Mm-hmm?
- I'll tell you later. Call the police.
- Okay.
[ Margo ]
Look! There it is!
Oh, my God!
Oh, this is impressive work.
- Who did this?
- You did.
We only have an hour left.
Disconnect it!
- Cut this off.
- [ Sizzling, Whirring ]
Aah! Dad, the timer!
You gotta stop it!
Oh, dear.
[ Gasps ]
Two minutes left.
- Aah!
- Ohh!
Oh!
Oh, my God!
Hurry, hurry, Dad!
- Ooh!
- This way!
- [ Rumbling ]
- [ Gasping ]
Oh, my God,
it's upstairs.
[ Screaming ]
Oh-oh!
Oh, no, the elevator!
- Dad! Be careful.
- Aah! Ooh!
Aah! No!
- Which wire?
- I just don't remember!
Pick one!
Oh, well, what the hell.
It's usually green.
No, green!
This is green.
That's red.
- I've gotta try to remember that.
- [ Sighs ]
What are you doing?
[ lndistinct Chattering ]
[ Siren Winding Down,
Stopping ]
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
[ Wainwright ]
Where the hell
did that come from?
Ahh. Mm-mm.
What is this?
Where am l? Huh?
You. Come here.
Look at me.
Look into my eyes.
Yes.
Release me at once.
[ Chuckling ]
No, we won't have
any of that, Mr. Khan.
Let's just have a look
at those stitches, shall we?
Stitches? What--
What have you done?
Saved your life, that's what.
We had to remove a little section
of your frontal lobe.
You'll never miss it, believe me.
It's a part nobody ever uses.
But-- But--
Unless you believe in telepathy!
[ Chuckles ]
Wait! Come back here!
You! Come here!
I am Shiwan Khan, the last descendant
of Genghis Khan! Listen to me!
[ Patients Shouting ]
I'm Houdini! I'm Theodore Roosevelt!
- I am Napoleon!
- I'm Josephine!
- I'm Babe Ruth!
- I'm Henry Vlll!
I'm William Shakespeare!
I'll see you later.
Hey, how will you know
where I am?
I'll know.
[ Piano Playing ]
I've been looking
for an original sin
One with a twist
and a bit of a spin
And since I done
all the old ones
'Til they've all
been done in
Now I'm just looking
and I'm gone with the wind
Endlessly searching
for an original sin
And you could dance forever
You got a fire in your feet
- But will it ever be enough
- Enough
- You know that it'll never be enough
- Never be enough
And you can fly and never land
and never need to see
- But will it ever be enough
- Enough
- You know that it'll never be enough
- Never be enough
It's not enough to make
the nightmares go away
It's not enough to make
the tears run dry
And who knows what evil lurks
in the hearts of men today
It's a city of shadows
It's a city of lies
It's a city of secrets
It's a city of crime
It'll all be over now
All I wanted
was a piece of the pie
I never got an equal share
When the stars are out of sight
and the moon is down
The natives are so restless tonight
All I needed was a spot in the light
It never had to get so dark
When the stars are out of sight
and the moon is down
The natives are so restless tonight
I've been looking
for the ultimate crime
Infinite victims
in infinitesimal time
And I'm so, so very guilty
for no reason or rhyme
For now I'm just looking
and I'm killing some time
Endlessly searching
for the ultimate crime
You can lose yourself in pleasure
'til your body's going numb
- But will it ever be enough
- Enough
- You know that it'll never be enough
- Never be enough
You can always take whatever
you conceivably could want
- But will it ever be enough
- Enough
- You know that it'll never be enough
- Never be enough
It's not enough to make
the nightmares go away
It's not enough to make
the tears run dry
And who knows what evil lurks
in the hearts of men today
It's a city of shadows
It's a city of lies
It's a city of cruelty
It's a city of crime
It'll all be over now
All I wanted
was a piece of the pie
I never got an equal share
When the stars are out of sight
and the moon is down
The natives are so restless tonight
All I needed was a spot
in the light
It never had to get so dark
When the stars are out of sight
and the moon is down
The natives are so restless tonight
Now I'm just looking
and I'm gone with the wind
Endlessly searching
for an original sin
I've been looking
for an original sin
One with a twist
and a bit of a spin
And since I've done
all of the old ones
'Til they've all been done in
Endlessly searching
for an original sin
I've been looking
for an original sin
One with a twist
and a bit of a spin
And since I've done
all of the old ones
'Til they've all been done in
Now I'm just looking
and I'm gone with the wind
Endlessly searching
for an original sin
I'm applying
for a license to thrill
Going out on the edge
Moving in for the kill
And there'll be hell to pay
some day
Put it all on the bill
'Cause I'll always be paying
and paying until
We're beyond expiration
with a license to thrill
I've been looking
for an original sin
