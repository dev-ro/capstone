  On Saturday, May 31st, 2014,
   at approximately 9:50 a.m.,
the Waukesha
Police Department
was notified
by a concerned
citizen
that a 12-year-old girl
was stabbed
in the area
of Big Bend Road
in the city of Waukesha.
        Female reporter:
   The stabbing brought a huge
   police presence to the area,
   a major search
   by ground and air
   looking for two other girls.
       Anissa Weier
       and Morgan Geyser
     are accused
     of stabbing their friend
   and leaving her for dead.
        Male reporter:
Weier and Geyser lured Payton

Police say that's when Geyser,
       holding the knife,

   as she screamed, 19 times
   with a five-inch blade.
    Sheriff: In the arms,
       legs, and torso.
        Male reporter:

     near her heart
     by just a millimeter.

        on the sidewalk,
     covered in blood
     and begging for help.
   When asked who attacked her,
   she said, "My best friend."
Police say the suspects
were inspired by a character
on a website
called Creepypasta,
      a site filled
      with scary stories.
   Now, the story they followed
     was about a character
     called Slenderman.
   A tall, fictional boogeyman
   featured on Internet blogs.
Slenderman, a faceless ghoul
many parents have likely
never heard of.

Anissa Weier and Morgan Geyser
       were found walking
       near the interstate.
      They later told police
      they planned to walk
     to Slenderman's mansion.
Female reporter 5:
Police say it's also who
the young suspects claimed
they wanted to please.
      Detective Trussoni:
     Anissa felt as though
      she needed to prove
  that Slenderman existed
  and would be able to do that
  by killing somebody.
    And Morgan said
    that her family would be
    in danger if they didn't.
    Prosecutors have charged
    the girls as adults.
  If convicted on the charges,
     each 12-year-old faces

          Unconsciously,
         Slenderman stems
     from a tradition that--
     that goes way, way back.
    To a great extent,
    the Brothers Grimm
    collected tales that deal
    with what I would call
    universal human struggles
        that we continue
        to have today.
       I think that's
       one of the reasons
    why people are
    responding to this tale,
       and they're telling
       their own versions,
    their own horror stories
    about what is happening
    in the world today.
   Slenderman is
   a tale about a character,
   a strange weird character,
   who may feed upon children.
   It made me think of a legend
  that Jacob
  and Wilhelm Grimm collected
      called "The Pied Piper
      of Hamelin."
    Many years ago a town was
    being devastated by rats--
       in the gutters...
       on the streets...
        in the cellars.
       The Pied Piper comes
       out of nowhere.
      And he's a very odd,
      strange-looking person,
        but he has a flute
       or some type of pipe
       that he plays.
The man said,
"If you want me to get rid
of the rats, you must pay me."
     So they said, "Yes,
     as much as you want
        if you can get rid
        of the rats."
       The Piper began
       blowing on the pipe.
   The rats began following.
               ♪ ♪
    The Piper had all the rats
    jump into the river.
        But the mayor
        and the councilmen
        cheat him.
      And the Piper said,
      "You know,
           "there are
          other tunes
           I can pipe
         "and ways that
        I can repay you
    in a way that
    you will never forget."

    So the Piper took
    his pipe to his lips again
       and he began piping.
     (children playing)
       The people froze,
       but the children
       followed him.
     There was an opening,
         a sudden opening
         in the mountain.
  And all the children headed
  toward this opening.
   And as the last one entered,
       the mountain closed,
       and the Piper
       went inside as well.
             (booms)
      Depending on the times
      and the person who is
      telling their version
       of "The Pied Piper,"
      he can be

At the time,

our fifth-grade son is going

Tom Haynes:
So this is the yearbook
from Anissa's fifth grade year.

And this is what Anissa wrote.
it says, "You're like
a second dad to me."
So that was really sweet.
It's kind of tough
looking back on it,
'cause if she felt that strong,
you know, just...
     maybe I could have done
     something else.
     Anissa was definitely
     one of the biggest
     outliers I've had
       just because she had
       no solid connections
       with other
       4th and 5th-graders.
  Anissa would definitely cry
  once every couple weeks,
  I would want to say.
   Mostly about... kids
   being mean to her at school.
   She wouldn't
   be able to contain herself
   in front of the whole class,
      and sometimes
      she would just cry.
So other kids
were aware of her...
        emotions,
        and being upset.
        And there's times
        she would come in
        from lunch/recess
       and cry about
       not having friends.
I've guessed that Anissa made
a connection with Morgan
      and was happy
      that they both were
      into Slenderman,
      was happy that
      she made a new friend,
       shared a connection,
       shared interest,
   and it may have spiraled
   out of control from there.

Attorney:
At some point, your discussion
got into the area
of a birthday party
that was planned for Morgan?
       Payton said that
       the birthday party
       had been planned
       for several weeks,
    and it was for May 30th,
    and that they had planned
    to go do Skateland
       and sleep over
       at Morgan's house.
             Angie:
         They were being
       normal little girls.
    They were running
    up and down the stairs,
         holding hands
         and giggling.
        There was no...
    indication that anything
    was-- was off
  or that we had anything to--
      to be worried about.
After Skateland,
they came back to Morgan's house
       and they went
       into the basement.
(speaks matter-of-factly)
       And we-- we woke up
       in the morning,
        and we had donuts
        and strawberries
        for breakfast,
        and everything
        was very normal.
 The girls were laughing and...
       having a good time.
        And they asked
        if they could go
        to the park,
       and I didn't think
       anything of it.
    I said, "Yeah, of course
    you can go to the park."
       And, you know,
       Morgan said goodbye
        and told me
        she loved me.

       "Seeing my friends,
      "none of these things
      are dangerous.
 These friends can't disappear.
 They're important to me."
Attorney:
Was she referring to real world
friends or fictional friends?
      Fictional, I believe.
Attorney 2: She's not allowed
to hug her family or touch them?
      Not in our facility.
Attorney 2: Right.
    She made clear
    that her primary concern
    was with her relationship
    with Slenderman,
  and she felt like
  if she says the wrong thing,
       if she somehow
       upsets Slenderman,
     not only hers
     but her family's lives
     could be in danger.
  With childhood schizophrenia,
      almost everyone
      develops, eventually,
     negative symptoms
     and cognitive symptoms.
   What's unique
   about Morgan's circumstance
     is that a severe course
     is so predictable.
Well, we knew her diagnosis
before we went to meet them
at the hospital.
We had a conference call
with two of the doctors,
so we were--
we were prepared.
And the reason that
we all went up there, actually,
was so that
we could tell Morgan
what her diagnosis was.
     And we thought
that it would be helpful
     for her to know
that her father also...
had the same mental illness,
because we had
never told her previously
that Matt had schizophrenia.
We were very worried
about the way that
she might react
to learning that
she has schizophrenia
because Morgan--
Morgan's a very smart girl,
and she's been reading...
      Matt: Which makes me think
      that she knew.
Yeah.
     I think when they told her,
     she was probably like...
Not surprised.
           ..."Well, that's what
           I would've guessed...
            if I had
            to diagnose myself."
Angie:
What I think is
that Morgan knows
that other people
don't see her hallucinations,
but they're still
very real to her.
Like, in her head
they are real,
and they're
there with her.
They're there.
Angie: But I think
that she knows
that other people
don't see them.
Otherwise, why would
she make an attempt to...
Cover it up. Mm-hmm.
Angie:
...hide them from us, exactly.
  It's because
  she doesn't want to lose them.
         She's afraid they would
         be taken from her.
     Angie:
     This is the doll house,
        or the components
        for a doll house,
      that Morgan made
      while she was housed
   at Washington County
   Juvenile Detention Center.
   And she just put so much...
  detail into it, it's amazing.
        She's not allowed
        to have scissors,
        so all of these--
       all of these
       tiny little pieces
       she ripped by hand.
      This is a television,
      and these are
    some of her
    little cartoon characters
    that she likes to draw.
     This actually, I think,
     is a character
   that's modeled after Spock.
        When I watched her
        do a couple of the dolls
               and the--
               and the clothing,
        and she said what was
     surprising is how few times
       she had to start over.
      Like, she was able to just
      be meticulous about--
Here's some food.
I think this is salad
and a piece of pizza.
   A salad and a piece of pizza.
 Here's a little
laptop computer.
See there's even
detail on the screen.
   Look at the cute little heart
   on the front of the computer.
         This looks like
        it's another TV.
        Oh, and there's--
        how appropriate.
    There's a courtroom drama
   playing in the background.
When I ask her
what she wants to watch
on TV that night--
it's one of the things
I usually ask her when
I talk to her on the phone--
she'll say that it depends
on whose turn it is to decide.
 And she's in a cell by herself,
 so she's the only person there.

   The court's prepared

    There was
    a conscious decision made
   at the time of the offense
   to let the victim die.
      They told P.L.

   They're a year older today.
   But what happens at age 18?
