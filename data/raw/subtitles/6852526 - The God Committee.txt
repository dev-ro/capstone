Technically, you'd refer to him
as TS-16, or "Test Subject 16."
But folks around
the lab have given him
a nickname: Columbus
[all chuckling].
Columbus is the first animal
to carry a humanized organ
we believe can be safely
used for transplantation.
In his case, it's a kidney.
As you know,
Xenotransplantation
is hardly a novel concept.
Doctors and scientists
have been trying
to exchange organs and
tissue cross-species for years.
Up until now, it hasn't worked.
What is unique about X-Origins
is that we've created
a patented gene-editing tool
that helps to produce organs
that the host immune system
won't reject.
In other words,
we harnessed this technology
on pigs so that it can
become a reality for humans.
In the prospectus,
it says human testing
is 24 months away.
Why so far out?
[Boxer] The FDA requires
two years of nonhuman trials.
There is a pig exactly
like this one
who is carrying a kidney that
was engineered for a monkey.
That's where we start.
So when
would we start recouping?
I won't lie to you. Uh,
it's gonna take quite a while.
Allow me to say this,
if I can...
If we are successful,
this tech will eradicate
the tremendous need for
healthy human organs worldwide.
We will
revolutionize transplantation.

Great to meet you.
So, as you have no doubt
noticed, we have a new face.
Dr. Taylor is gonna be

Until that time, we're gonna
roll with a six-man committee.
Guys, it is an honor.
I'd like to jump right in,
'cause I've got some good news.
One of our own, Serena Vazquez,
is getting a heart.
[heart monitor beeping]
The donor is an 18-year-old
boy from Buffalo.
Dr. Riggs is bringing
the organ home as we speak.
Boxer's operating,
incision time is 9 a.m.
I'll be scrubbing up
in 30 minutes.
May we make this short
and sweet, please?
Our first patient
is up for reclassification.
Walter Curtis, who has DCM.
He is currently Status 1-B, but
his condition has deteriorated.
Positives: He's 48,
he's employed.
He has a strong support system.
I'm married. And I've got
three beautiful daughters
And negatives: he's 5'9,
335 pounds.
Bipolar, but I did
pass my last psych eval.
Primary insurance, but... I
don't have a secondary policy.
I'd like to point out
that Walter
has lost eight pounds
since he's been here.
How long has he been here?
- It's still progress.
- Three months.
Three months
of controlled diet,
he's lost
a measly eight pounds.
Richard Simmons wouldn't blush.
We wouldn't be
giving him a heart,
we'd be giving him a time bomb.
[sarcastic] Well, don't
sugarcoat it, Boxer.
- Statistics don't lie.
- But they never tell
the whole story either,
which is why we're here.
Let's hear from Dr. Taylor,
Walter's her patient...
I think that Walter's trying.
Actually, I know
that he's trying.
He's not blessed
with a good metabolism,
but should that preclude him
from getting a heart?
I don't think so.
He's putting three daughters
through college
on a doorman's salary.
And for that
he deserves a heart?
[nurse] And a Nobel Prize!
Look, he's reliable,
he takes his medication.
He's a cheerleader
for the entire ward...
And he plays guitar,
and he makes finger puppets
for pediatrics. This is not
a congeniality contest.
If you would let us finish,
Dr. Boxer, what we're trying
to say... is that Walter
has the right disposition.
He can handle it.
Walter's medical bills
are half a million, easy.
It's difficult to justify
adding another 200K
to such a high-risk patient.
With all due respect...
how can you quantify it?
We could add years
to Walter's life.
- You don't know.
- [Val] No, I don't know.
But I have to quantify it.
I'm responsible
for this program.
We've had some issues recently.
US News downgraded our rating.
Nine heart rejections
within the last year.
It's just dumb,
bad luck...
[Boxer] Or poor
decision-making.
Based on criteria more
sentimental than scientific.
[Val] We all have a voice,
we all come at this
from different angles.
It's why the process works.
I would like to propose
moving Walter up to Status 1-A.
Dr. Riggs has already e-mailed
in his vote. He's in favor.
- Dr. Gilroy?
- Not in favor.
- Dr. Boxer?
- No.
- Dr. Lau?

[Gilroy] Guys, this is
Father Dunbar.
He is a former attorney
representing the board.
Father, this is Dr. Boxer,
Dr. Lau, Nurse Wilkes.
And, of course,
you know Dr. Taylor.
Why exactly is he here?
Because Trip Granger
is a match for this heart.
[Gilroy] Boxer is correct.
Trip Granger?
I checked him in this morning.
[Gilroy]
His father's Emmett Granger.
Granger Venture Partners.
What does Trip do?
He tans well,
parties even better,
and has a unique talent
for ending up
on Page Six for the latter.
[Gilroy] Trip had a heart
attack early this morning.
He was airlifted from Montauk
on his father's jet.
We're also treating
his girlfriend, Holly Matson.
I saw her today, too.
She was cut up pretty badly.
[Wilkes] That's strange...
No, Trip
didn't have any lacerations.
I'm assuming they were
in some sort of accident?
Why do we suddenly need
a spiritual/legal/
whatever-you-are watchdog?
The circumstances have changed.
I have a letter from the board.
"At approximately 5:15 a.m.,
Emmett Granger contacted
Chairman Scott Lacey.
He wanted the board to be
aware of his appreciation
for past care,
and understood that we would
do everything humanly
possible for his son.
As a show of gratitude, and
regardless of Trip's prognosis,
he informed Chairman Lacey
that he would recommend
a $25 million grant
from The Granger Institute
to St. Augustine Hospital.
The board places full trust
in you, the Heart Committee,
to make the right decision
regarding Trip Granger."
You can't be serious.
$25 million?
I don't get out of bed
for less than 30.
[Lau] What does it mean,
he would "recommend"
a grant
from the Granger Institute?
He is the Granger Institute.
[Boxer] It's a loophole.
We don't get the money
if Trip doesn't get the heart.
- He's bribing us.
- Bingo.
Not exactly.
"Regardless
of Trip's prognosis."
Disregard the letter.
We remain objective.
[Lau] I hope we can.
Unconsciously, this could
prejudice us against Trip.
[Wilkes] Or the opposite.
Come on, let's be real.
This place
has seen better days.
Our equipment is prehistoric,
we're short-staffed.
They can't even finish
the renovation, for God's sake!
We pick Trip, and we're saving
much more than one patient.
Now, of course, we can't
let the money decide,
but black and white this ain't.
I disagree. I think
the money should be irrelevant.
I'm surprised the board
would even make us aware.
You are so young.
The board wants Trip
to get the heart.
[Dunbar] Uh, that's false.
They were concerned
that Mr. Granger
would reach out
to one of you personally.
They sent me to ensure
that any decision you make
would be irrefutable.
As you know, many
of these transplant decisions
- end up in courtrooms.
- Very clever,
sending in a priest
to do their dirty work.
All right, just relax. We're
waiting on Trip's drug results.
The decision
could be made for us.
- How so?
- If a patient's been using,
they're ineligible. UNOS rules.
As you may have
gleaned from our rating,
it's hard enough to keep
a transplanted heart ticking.
You add chems to that,
and it's sayonara, baby.
[Wilkes] And Trip
isn't exactly a saint.
He OD'd on cocaine
nine months ago.
Let's table Trip and move on.

- Negatives: I'm single.
I don't have children
or any other family.
I haven't worked
since my husband passed away.
On paper, she doesn't have
an established support system.
[Boxer] I'm fine with Janet
getting this heart,
assuming that it's between
her and Walter Curtis.
I'm on board with that.
Why, 'cause she passed
her wallet autopsy?
- Have you read my reports?
- Yes, I have.
And I've examined her myself.
It's not financial.
Janet's healthier than Walter.
She has a better shot
of sustaining post-op,
even without
the support system.
Well, she's demanding
and impatient with the nurses.
In other words, she's a bitch.
Wow, that's insightful.
The sort of analytical
thinking that's about
to submarine this program.
[Lau] Here's a fact for you:
Janet's ambivalent
about a transplant.
The idea of having
someone else's heart
in her body
is disturbing to her.
Yet she still listed.
You want Walter
to have the heart.
I told you, I'm abstaining.
[Boxer]
You have to vote on this.
We are not classifying.
What is the conflict?
Nine years ago,
Walter tried to commit suicide.
He ingested
a bottle of Percocet.
Jesus. And you cleared him
after that?
He was diagnosed Bipolar.
He started on Lithium, and
he's been stable ever since.
I didn't think he was
a suicide risk any longer.
So, what's the problem?
Why can't you vote?
I lost my daughter
five months ago. She overdosed.
I'm so sorry.
Point is,
I can't evaluate Walter fairly.
I think the suicide is
a disqualifier.
Besides, there's so many
other issues with this patient.
[Dunbar] Can I ask you
something, Dr. Boxer?
Aren't these decisions
supposed to be made
on pragmatic, medical grounds?
- [Boxer] They are.
- So... who are you to judge?
You can't possibly understand
what Walter was going through.
I'd say an attempted
suicide is pretty relevant
to a character evaluation,
wouldn't you?
Who knows? Evaluating someone's
true character...
or soul, if you will... seems
like a risky proposition to me.
It's like waving a welcome mat
to a Jehovah's Witness.
[Gilroy] Father,
this is standard.
Yeah, but it doesn't
change the fact
that you're making decisions
based on personal perception.
He's not on the stand.
He might be.
You all might be.
If you make choices
based on anything
that can't be quantified,
you're playing God.
I'll be first to step aside
when God walks in here
and votes.
In ten years,

Janet Pike may not

We know Walter wants this.
For his family, for himself.
Walter wants to live.

Okay. What happens when Walter

stronger than Percocet
in his medicine cabinet?

Dr. Lau passed him

Everybody has!

It's possible.

Holly Matson?
She's pregnant.
Please tell me you're kidding.
[Gilroy] How do you know that?
I ran into Nurse Cruz, who's
treating her, on my break.
- If it is a false positive...

and took that 18-year-old's
heart with him...
Walter Curtis, Janet Pike...
they could've had years.
This organ, in Istanbul...
somebody else
could have years with it, too.
[Taylor] Let me
ask you something:
if you knew that this heart
could give you six months,
- could you finish your work?
- I don't know.
Yes, you do.
No guarantee
I'd get six months.
Hell, I could die on the table,
with you operating.
[wheezy chuckling]
[coughing]
[exhaling]
If you don't take this organ,
we don't know where it's going.
There's no guarantee
it'll be put to good use.

You know I'll never be
a father to Hunter.
Even a new heart
won't change that.
[choked] I know.
Take it, Boxer.
Put the committee
out of business.
I'd like to get back
to being a doctor.

Good morning, folks.
We have just entered
Turkish airspace.
We are starting our descent
and should be landing
in about 40 minutes.
I've been informed
that Mr. Granger has arranged
ground transport
and a translator,
so you should be all set.
Just buckle your seat belts,
relax, and we'll have you
on the ground shortly.
