Susan: It's not easy
spending a day in the city
with two kids
around christmastime,
even if you have taken them to
a matinee and outdoor skating.
I'd had to fight with them,
with Danny in particular,
to get them aboard the 3:55
back to the suburbs
in time for dinner.
Presents were still in his mind.
What's in the box?
Susan: Danny...
Leave the man alone.
Present.
- Can I see?
- Susan: Danny.
Stop being so nosy.
It's okay. No problem.
Gotta go. My stop's next.
Brookfield next.
Brookfield.
Jenny: Come on, Danny.
What'd he have?
Who?
The man, dummy,
the one with the box.
What was in the box?
The one on the subway.
Oh. Nothin'.
Nothing?
You seriously mean it was empty?
- There was nothing in there?
- Robert: Hey, guys.
Chow's on.
Great.
What's the matter, squirt?
Not hungry?
Danny: Not really.
You, not hungry?
You're always hungry.
Did you get them
something to eat
when you were out?
Just hot chocolate.
With marshmallows and licorice.
Robert: Nice.
Can I go play?
Sure.
But I want those teeth brushed.
- Yeah, dad.
- Robert: All right.
More?
They're coming to get you,
Barbara.
- Robert: Want some, Danny?
- Barbara: Stop it.
- Robert: No? Wow.
- Barbara: You're ignorant.
More for us.
Barbara: Stop it.
You're acting like a child!
Man:
They're coming for you.
- Oh, my god. Look.
- Oh, look.
Man:
Here comes one of them now.
- Raah!
- Barbara: He'll hear you.
Susan: Kids.
No running.
No, thanks, mom.
Daniel.
Yeah, mom?
Don't forget your lunch.
Thanks.
Robert: What's going on?
- You're not hungry again?
- Nope.
It was pizza day at school.
No, I skipped it.
I find that hard to believe.
Come on. Eat your ribs.
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.
Robert: He came home
with his lunch untouched again,
you know.
Really?
He was probably
sneaking junk food
in the cafeteria or something.
I think we should make
an appointment with Dr. weller.
Maybe he's coming down
with something.
I'm sure it's just
some stunt he's pulling
to get out of going to school.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Well, I am starting
to get worried.
Look, he doesn't have a fever.
And even if he has the flu,
there's nothing Dr. weller
can do for him anyway.
I guess so.
Robert: Listen, buddy,
you gotta eat something.
Danny, why didn't you eat
the lunch I made you today?
I didn't feel like it.
Jenny: Try some garlic bread.
It's really good.
You love spaghetti.
No, thanks.
It... it's been three days,
buddy.
Are you feeling okay?
Jenny: Oh, my god.
It better not be the chickenpox.
Amanda dewsbury
had the chickenpox,
and she didn't show up
for school
for, like, an entire week.
She was covered in, like,
these disgusting,
oozing sores...
I feel fine,
just not hungry.
Okay.
Come on, Danny.
We made your favorite, pizza.
Come on now.
Not hungry.
Smells good.
You're not getting up
from this table
until you eat that pizza.
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me?!
Please, Danny,
just take one bite.
No, thank you.
This has gone on
long enough. Danny!
God damn it, will you just eat?!
I'm not hungry.
Fine.
Then just go to bed.
Dr. manson, circuit three.
Any, uh, dizziness,
vomiting, diarrhea?
No, nothing.
Fever, listlessness?
No. He seems fine.
And you say
he hasn't eaten in five days?
Robert: Absolutely nothing.
Can I have a moment
with him, please?
Um, yeah, sure.
- Susan: Sure.
- Thanks.
Danny...
Hmm?
Is there anything
you want to tell me?
You sure? I mean...
I'm here to listen.
I wanna help.
Everything's fine.
I'm just not hungry, is all.
You gotta eat, Danny.
Why?
Well, um...
There's people starving
all over the world.
I mean, if you don't eat...
Eventually you'll die.
It's that simple.
So?
Why didn't you
bring him in sooner?
I don't know.
Well, he's lost five pounds
since his last checkup.
Other than that,
he seems fine physically.
We're gonna run
some tests on him,
and hopefully, uh,
it'll give us a clearer picture.
Has he had
any problems at school?
- No.
- No.
Nothing that we're aware of.
Doctor: Home?
No. Why do you ask?
I think Danny might be having
some emotional problems.
Now, there's a specialist
that I can recommend for you.
A psychiatrist?
No, a therapist,
and don't worry.
He's not gonna
push any pills on Danny.
He'll be there to help him.
Well, how's he gonna help him,
doctor?
Look, we're gonna
get to the bottom of this.
Now, what I want you to do
is to call me every day
and let me know
how Danny's doing,
if he's eating.
Okay.
If he's not, don't push him.
No, of course not.
Doctor: All right?
Stay calm.
I'll keep you posted.
- Thanks, Dr. weller.
- Thanks.
Jenny: It doesn't
make any sense.
Hey.
What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
Come on. What were you
just talking about?
Just stuff.
Secret stuff?
Just, you know, stuff.
Stuff that maybe has to do
with why you're not eating?
That kind of stuff?
Fine.
Let's get back to bed.
Jenny, what's the matter?
Oh, nothing.
Good night, mom.
Susan: Jenny.
Jenny: Coming.
Hey, mom.
Hey.
Yeah, mom?
- It's chocolate.
- I'm okay.
I'm not hungry. Thanks.
Where's Jenny?
She says she's not hungry.
Why?
I don't know.
I wish I did.
Are you taking
any of this seriously?
Of course I am.
I'm their mother.
Well,
I just don't understand it.
Understand what?
How you can eat
while our children are starving.
Well, I have to eat, don't I?
Danny.
Hey.
What is going on
with you and Jenny?
Y... you know you can tell me.
Please, tell me.
What did he say?
Huh?
Danny.
Oh.
Nothing.
Piece for you.
Piece for you.
There you go.
Susan: I remember laughter
from that day,
plenty of laughter.
Nobody's new clothes fit,
but we tried them on anyway.
Believe it or not,
we were happy.
We were more together
than we had ever been.
Danny...
Do you remember
that day on the train...
The man with the box?
Do you remember
looking inside the box?
Yeah.
What was in it?
Nothing.
Really nothing?
You mean it was actually empty?
But I thought I...
I remember him saying
it was a present.
Was he playing
some kind of a joke?
I mean, is this
some kind of a joke?
Susan: Danny died
on January 17th.
Jenny went on February third,
and my husband Robert lingered
until the 27th.
And through all of this,
through all these weeks now,
going back and forth
to the hospital each day...
I look for him.
I need to find him...
To know what my son knew and
then passed on to the others.
It's the only way
I can get close to them now.
I want to see.
I have to see.
I'm hungry.
Tsk.
Good morning, Carla.
Oh, thank you.
The guests will be getting here
in less than an hour.
I let Lucy sleep in.
She hasn't been sleeping well.
You want me to wake her?
Um, guess maybe wake her
in 15 if she's not up yet.
Okay.
Is that for David?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
No, I don't think Mr. lampton
will be joining us
at his daughter's birthday.
His car was here
when I got in this morning.
Must have gotten in late.
No. No.
He's not back from his trip yet.
Maybe he's out for a run.
I really doubt it.
I think I would know
if he had come in last night.
Yes, of course. I didn't...
Okay. I... well,
I'll just take his, too.
No use letting it go to waste.
Can you, um...
Get the table runner
from the hall closet,
and, uh, just put it
on the side table.
I think we're gonna do
gifts and cards over there.
Yes, ma'am.
Ooh, sorry.
David.
God, between you and Carla,
you're gonna give me
a heart attack.
You know, I didn't
even hear you come in.
I don't know.
Anyway, I'm just so glad
that you're back.
I really, really want this
to go well.
Lucy has been having
such anxiety,
and I'm just really
hoping that this
brings her out of her shell.
Do you know her therapist
says that she gets her anxiety
from watching me?
Me?
Can you believe it?
I mean, the nerve.
It's just... anyway,
it doesn't matter.
She's gonna be so glad
that you made it.
David?
David...
Lucy: Mom!
Mommy!
Where are you?
Hi.
I'm right here, panda.
Good morning.
Happy birthday.
It's my birthday.
I know. I know.
It is your birthday.
I had an accident.
Oh, no. Oh, luce,
what happened?
It's gonna be okay.
All right?
Everything's gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.
All right.
Okay. We'll just...
Go find another costume.
There we go.
Scary ghost.
Lucy: It's not scary at all.
I look stupid.
Sweetheart,
you don't look stupid.
You look great.
I think it's
gonna really be scary.
Lucy: Boo!
There you go.
Got me, scary ghost.
Ohh.
Why don't you go find Carla
and show her?
Lucy: Now I am a dead girl.
Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo...
Oh, David...
You idiot.
Lucy: Did you find them?
Carla: Yes, dear.
I told you I would.
I don't know
why you keep hiding things
in daddy's office.
You know how he gets
when we touch his things.
Lucy: I know. Where's mom at?
Carla: Probably straightening
a painting somewhere.
Lucy: Huh?
Carla: Come on.
Let's go outside
and finish that drawing.
It's too nice outside
to be in this stuffy house.
Oh, my god.
Madeline: Mary?
Mary?
Mary?
Are you in there?
Carla told me
you were futzing around
back here.
Mare?
I just need to speak with you
for a moment, dear.
I know you're busy
with the party prep and all.
Mare?
Mary?
Oh, there you are.
Hi, Madeleine.
Hi. Good morning.
What are you doing down there?
Oh, I was just, uh...
Fixing the carpet.
What have you got back there?
Something big
for Lucy's birthday, no doubt.
You know tilly Anderson
from across the street?
They got her daughter gwinnifer,
- that little chubby thing...
- Yes.
They had a designer in Europe
build her a Princess coach bed
complete with flat-screen TV
built in.
Like she needs
to be laying around
in front of the TV any more
than she already does.
Poor thing, bless her heart,
she's gonna have
a rough go of it
come junior high.
I told tilly
she needs to get her
into that new pilates
for preteens class
over on Fairmont.
What can I... what can
I do for you, Madeleine?
Well, it's just I know
that it's Lucy's birthday today,
and I know that
my stepdaughters are away
at that new boarding school
in Vermont, you know,
in sunny hill. Very exclusive,
very hard to get into.
But it's just
the entire neighborhood,
it seems to be talking
about this party, so...
Would you like to come
to the party, Madeleine?
Oh! Why, that'd be lovely, dear.
- Thanks so much for the invite.
- Yeah. Okay.
You know, last month,
the Gibsons over on Chestnut...
- No.
- They had a deejay,
an entire magic-themed
fun house.
Oh, gosh.
Are you doing anything special
for Lucy?
It's just her friends and cake.
- Oh.
- So, mm-hmm.
Well, let me know if you
want me to get anything.
It's really no trouble. There's
a designer cupcake place...
Mary: All right,
see you in a bit.
Madeline: Over by where
I get the cats washed.
Okay. Just...
Just let me know. Thanks, dear.
Fuck.
Oh, Madeleine,
for the love of...
What the...
Well, hey, I wasn't done yet.
I got, like,
three more verses to go.
I'll give you $200 for the suit.
Well, nah, just hit play, and...
I'm not... I'm not Lucy, okay?
Lucy's my daughter,
so you don't have to worry.
I think it's gotta be Lucy.
You're not listening.
300. You want 300?
Ah, there's a down payment
on the suit,
and I got a thing
this afternoon.
- I...
- $1,000.
$1,000 and two ounces
of medical marijuana
from my knee surgery last year.
Lucy: Mom!
Mom, where are you?!
They're here! They're here!
They're here!
Come on! Come on!
Where are you?
They're here! Party time!
Carla: Just a minute, darling.
I'm coming.
Gretchen: Wait.
How are we gonna know
if it is or if it
isn't the right way?
Paul: I have an internal compass
that has failed me never.
Gretchen: Wait.
So the white scorpion
is the dangerous one?
Paul: Just look out for
translucent scorpions.
Gretchen:
I feel like all scorpions
are probably dangerous.
Paul: Yeah, I mean,
they all hurt,
but the lighter
the color the scorpion,
the more dangerous it is.
I wouldn't even worry
about the black ones.
Just watch your step.
Gretchen: Paul, I feel like
you do this to me all the time.
Like when we were kids
and you told me that...
The spider
was gonna bite me in the face
and then lay eggs
and then these baby spiders
were gonna hatch out of my skin
in the middle of the night.
Paul: 'Cause that shit happens.
Gretchen: No, it doesn't.
I didn't sleep for
a week. That's not even cute.
Paul: That happened to
Jamie Preston's brother
in the fifth grade.
- Hand to god.
- Jay: Jamie Preston?
That was the kid with the rash?
Gretchen:
No, that was his cousin.
Whew!
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!
Whoo!
Huh?
Gretchen: Oh, my god.
This is so fucking epic.
Paul: Right?
This is why you guys
should let me do
the planning every year.
Paul, we'd end up
in a strip club in Vegas.
Jay: Some booze cruise
in Louisiana.
Paul: Yes, how good was that,
though? Seriously?
Gretchen: Wow. We're really
high up here.
- Jess: Don't fall.
- - Stop!
That's not funny!
Jess: Oh, babe, relax.
I had you.
Jay: Why would you do that?
Jess: Because I had her,
so it was a great joke.
Baby, are you seriously mad?
Whoo!
Right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
You want a picture?
- Yep.
- Okay.
Okay.
What are you doing?
- I'm just...
- Just be normal.
Be normal.
Ah, it's just really hot,
and you know
I'm afraid of heights.
Since when?
What do you mean, "since when"?
Since forever.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm, like, tired,
and I'm communing with nature.
- Okay. Okay.
- I have, like, one mo...
What are you looking at?
Gretchen: Oh, my god!
- Is it a scorpion?!
- Jess: No!
Gretchen: I hate scorpions.
- Is it white?
- Ow!
- I'm sorry.
That time,
I wasn't fucking with you.
- Jay: You okay?
- She's fine.
Seriously something
creepy on this wall.
- What happened?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Look.
Oh, my gosh.
Ah, cool.
Jess: What does it mean?
"Get off my lawn"?
No, they paint them
into the walls
to mark their territory.
Ooh. Like ancient gang signs.
Who's they?
Indians?
Paul, it's "native American."
That's the...
What you're supposed to say.
Older than that,
predates native Americans
for sure.
That looks like blood.
- Yikes.
- Gross.
Well, all righty.
Time to get moving
if we're gonna get back by dark.
Wait. Wouldn't people
native to America
before the native Americans
be called native Americans?
Jay: Not necessarily.
Could be early homo sap
or homo novus,
depending on what theory
of history you subscribe to.
This is it, man.
It's just us and the stars
and the best hiking around
all weekend.
Yeah.
It's nice.
That glamping place
that I booked
in the... in the park,
that was also really nice.
That had showers.
And it had screaming children.
And paths where you can walk
and not get lost and...
Trail markers made of
crushed natural ice cans
from frat bros.
Exactly. Thank you.
This is
the best campsite around, okay,
and nobody even knows about it.
How'd you know about it?
I just know shit, man, okay?
I commune with nature,
and it shows me the way.
- It shows him the way.
Or he bribed the gas station guy
at the last stop.
Paul: And also that.
- Gretchen: What?!
- That's true.
- Are you kidding me? Paul!
- What?
It could be, like,
illegal for us
to be out here.
This is like a historical
heritage site, clearly.
- Ah.
- You know, we could
- get arrested for that.
- Oh, come on.
What? You think they want people
spray-painting dicks
on those ancient murals?
Hieroglyphs.
Petroglyphs.
Hieroglyphs are Egyptian.
Paul: Oh, my god.
I hate you so much sometimes.
I don't think anyone's been
up here in a long time.
Maybe it's cursed.
It's not...
You think it's cursed?
What was that?
Paul: What was that?
- No, Paul, don't do that.
- I'll check it out.
No, no. Paul,
please don't do that. Fuck.
- Gretch, don't...
- Paul, please don't...
Oh, my god!
It's got me! Oh! Run!
Gretch, don't entertain him.
You're just encouraging him.
- I know. I fucking know he's...
He's razzing me.
I got it. I know.
Paul?
Jess: Where the fuck did he go?
I don't know.
Paul, come on, dude.
I'm not...
I'm not coming to get you.
He does this.
You remember he did this
in the adirondacks?
He, like, wandered off,
and then he, like,
broke his fucking ankle.
- I was just kidding.
- Don't, Paul.
- That's not fucking funny.
- What?
You love me.
Come on.
Okay, we're done
fucking with her.
Seriously.
I'm going to bed.
What? No!
It's so early.
I was just fucking around.
Gretchen: I'm not feeling good.
How's your hand?
- I don't know. It stings.
- Ohh.
Jay: You can put
some neosporin on that.
It might get infected.
Your face is infected.
Gretchen: Infected?
Okay.
Where's the neosporin?
I have some in my bag.
You want me to show you?
- No, I can get that.
- All right.
Sleep well.
Jess: Love you.
Wow.
Oh, man.
I got way too stoned, you guys.
Jess: Oh, no.
What the fuck?
Gretch?
Gretchen, what are you doing?
Hey, are you okay?
Jay. We shouldn't be here.
Hey. Gretchen, what is...
What's...
Jay: What's wrong with you?
Gretchen?
You shouldn't be here.
Paul: What the fuck, man?
- Jay, what's happening?
- Jay.
What are you...
What time is it? What...
Jay, what the fuck is happening?
I don't know! I don't know!
We have to go!
Where's Gretchen?
- Jay, what are you...
- Gretch?
- What are you doing?
- Jay!
What the fuck is going on?!
Say something!
Paul: Whoa! Stop, stop, stop!
Paul: Jay. Whoa, dude.
No, no, no, no! She's hurt!
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Get the fuck off me.
- Paul: That's my sister.
- Jess: Oh, my god.
Paul: Gretchen! Gretchen!
Jess: This is so fucked.
We have to leave now, okay?
You can't go out there.
Jess: Why can't I go out there?!
She's fucking hurt!
Jay: Listen. Trust me.
- What is your deal?
- Just trust me.
I'm not leaving
without Gretchen.
Okay.
Shh.
Jay: Please. Ah...
- Uh...
Open the door.
Open the door.
Okay. Okay.
No. No.
Gretchen, it's me.
It's me.
Woman: So you
believe me, doctor?
You actually believe me?
I believe people have agendas.
Doctor: This crazy world,
I swear.
I'll go somewhere
they'll never, ever find me
or little Andy or Jenny.
Godspeed to you, Mrs...
No.
She's gone.
Come on. Come on.
Andy: Dumb beast.
You want anything special
for dinner tomorrow night?
Maybe I'll roast a chicken.
18.
Doesn't make sense.
Sure it does.
I was born.
Now I'm grown up.
Almost grown up.
Give me one more day
to be your mom
before you get to vote.
You're just sentimental.
We could see that new movie
that dad is in.
Ohh. Of all the things
you wanna do for your birthday,
that's it?
Where has he ever been for you?
How can he be there for me
when we're always
hiding from him?
Ambition can be an evil thing,
honey.
He'd rather be
a Hollywood playboy
than a real father to you,
and we're hiding for a reason.
Not this again. I gotta go, mom.
He doesn't deserve
to have you in his life.
I'm meeting with
your teacher today.
Do whatever you want.
Cora: We need to talk
about what happened at school.
Andy: Go ahead.
See what they say.
Cora: Kipper?
What is it, boy?
Want your coupons?
- Might as well.
Can't beat
two-for-one tuna fish.
So, um, is Andy old enough
to let you out of the house
for a night on the town?
Well, that's...
That's a nice suggestion,
- but I don't think...
- I know.
You're too busy.
Ah, out of self-respect,
I have to try
at least once a year.
I just thought you could
use a change of pace, is all.
I appreciate that, Chet.
It's kind of you to think of me.
Seems like you
haven't had it easy,
and you've always
done good by your kid.
I'm late for my shift.
The incident was unfortunate,
but nothing
that we feel requires...
Unfortunate?
Sir, are you on drugs?
Woman: Now, there's no call
for that kind of
hostile language, Mrs. withers.
This is insane.
Your son tore
my daughter's fingernails off,
tore them clear off.
She had to go
to the emergency room,
her hands were
bleeding so badly.
I just don't understand
why he would do
something like that.
"Because I felt like it."
That's what he told Stacy.
He's just never been a violent
or cruel...
Mrs. withers:
I hear the stories.
I hear about the things
he makes the other kids do,
all in the name of being
in the cool clique.
Mrs. withers, what about
Andy's side of the story?
I mean, who's to say
he wasn't provoked
at some point?
Are you suggesting
that this is Stacy's fault?
Conflicts like these
between hotheaded teenagers...
Stacy is on her way
to being valedictorian
at this school.
I would hardly call her...
are often
very complicated situations.
It's just not as black-and-white
as you're describing it.
I am at a loss.
He should be
suspended from school
or expelled.
What are you suggesting we do?
I think it would be helpful
if Stacy...
Takes a break from school,
vacation, if you will,
until the dust settles.
You can expect
a call from our lawyer
later this afternoon.
You've always been decent
to our family, Cora,
but your son needs real help.
And if you can't see that,
apparently so do you.
I apologize that you
had to witness that outburst.
You're...
Not going to punish him?
You have to do something,
or he's never going
to get the message.
Woman: No, we don't.
You see, Andy has sent
a message to us.
Over the course
of these past four years
at this school,
Andy has revealed himself
to be a truly remarkable
human being.
A prodigy, really.
You see, every now and then,
someone crosses our path
who will change the world
as we know it.
Andy is one of those people.
I hope you will support
all of our efforts
to protect what makes him
so very special.
We're so pleased
that you could visit.
Woman: You all right, hon?
You don't look so good.
I think my water broke.
Woman: Push, honey. Push!
That's it.
Woman: It's a boy.
He's a little angel.
No!
Andy?
Andy?
Who's in there with you?
My god, what happened?
You know what I want
for my birthday, mom?
Privacy. I want
some fucking privacy!
Andy, you told me
that you'd be out for the night.
I was scared.
I didn't know who...
I didn't know who...
Happy birthday, honey.
Don't wait up
for me tonight, mom.
No rest for the weary.
Am I right?
Chet. I am...
A little weary.
Hey, hey, hey.
Why so glum, Cora?
Today's a beautiful day.
Something's happening to Andy,
something just terrible.
Ah, now, he's just
growing up, is all,
- becoming a man.
- No!
He's not my Andy anymore.
But he never really was, was he?
What?
What do you mean?
I think it'll just get messy
the harder you fight him.
But that's just it.
I don't wanna fight with him.
- He's my son.
- No.
Stop fighting him.
Andy's real father
is coming to claim him soon.
Andy's father
has no interest in him.
He lives on movie sets
with a girlfriend in every port.
I can't imagine your ex
really understood
the agreement he made
back when he made it.
The agreement?
He offered you.
Who do you think
he offered you to?
Is it all coming back to you...
"Cora"?
Of course,
I wasn't there.
I only heard the story
a thousand times,
and I suppose the story
gets distorted over time,
but it happened.
And I have made my contribution.
I'd like to believe
that I've made a difference
in all this.
I have been blessed
to watch over you
all these years.
No. No!
And to watch over Andy,
to prepare the world
for this glorious day!
There's nothing
to be afraid of, Cora!
It's his time, is all!
Praise...
Praise his darkness.
Praise his darkness.
Andy, look at me.
Some lady came up to me today,
called me by my name.
Never seen her before
in my life.
Cora: Andy, look at me.
She said she knows my father...
Said he's been
waiting for me for a long time.
Andy, I am your mother,
and I demand
that you look at me.
She said I was
his only living son.
Whose son, mom?
You told me dad was
remarried and living
in Hollywood
with kids of his own.
He is.
He's had three wives
since I left him.
- What does she mean, mom?
- I don't know.
- She's crazy.
- What does she mean, mom?
What she said means nothing.
You are my son.
Do you hear me?
We have not lived
in town after town,
running from people
like this for no reason.
They're evil.
They have an agenda.
Don't listen to those words.
You're special.
You are. You always...
I'm more than that, mom!
Sometimes,
I just wanna hurt you...
Rip you to pieces.
Don't say things like that.
I have dreams
of an empire of misery.
Oh, honey, please stop
saying things like that.
I want you to kneel.
What?
I said kneel.
Kneel before me.
That's it.
Now crawl to me.
Oh, honey.
I wanna go live with dad now.
You're my boy.
You'll always be my boy.
I've got you, honey.
- Don't look at him.
Just close your eyes.
Listen to the story.
At first, you made me so unwell.
God, I had never felt so awful
as those first three months.
I ate raw liver and saltines,
and other than that,
I couldn't keep a thing down.
You just took the life
out of me,
and you took and took
until one day,
I said, "I've had enough."
And I swear, honey,
deep in my belly,
you heard me cry.
You heard
how much pain I was in,
because you and I are bonded,
no matter who your father is.
The perversion.
It's something unholy
they did to me.
And when I found out
those sick people
wanted you for their own,
I went to the doctor
I should have seen
in the first place,
and I told him our crazy story,
and Andy, Andy, he believed me.
And he gave us enough money
to leave the city,
and we've been running
ever since.
That doctor's kindness,
that's proof of god, Andy.
I had never learned
to take care of myself
until that day,
that day I found out
they wanted you for their own.
I had to choose
my old life or you,
and I chose you, Andy.
I'm choosing you again now.
Please...
It's too late, mom.
He's too big.
Through the new schools
and the chickenpox
and the loneliness,
where was he?
He never made an appearance,
only now,
now that I've done
all the heavy lifting.
Well, I'm not finished.
He doesn't get
to make the choice.
You make it.
You make it.
Love you, mom.
