Woman:
Oh, my God!
Shoot, I-- fuck it.
Man:
Shoot, hold on.
Let me get...
Man, I'm beatin'
Joker's Gang's ass.
Second-round knock-out,
I promise y'all.
Second round, I'm gonna knock
this fuckin' clown out tonight.
Swear to God.
What's up?
Go get it in, pussy.
You hurt my pocket, fuck boy.
I'll make you
my bitch, nigga!
I'll take your cookies, nigga!
You're gonna see it
in the ring!
You're gonna see!
I'm gonna fuck
your nigga up.
Yeah, okay. We're gonna see,
we're gonna see what's up.
Throw the hands now, dawg.
Throw the hands now, dawg.
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna handle him.
You mad 'cause I got OnlyFans
with your bitch?
Man, what's up?
What's up, man? What's up?
Eleven o'clock. Ele--
Eleven o'clock.
You ain't even live
in the hood, nigga.
You live in
a rich area, nigga.
I'm in the hood,
South Side of St. Pete, nigga.
727 in this bitch, nigga.
Real swamp shit, nigga.
You a fuck boy.
You gonna get beat up.
-What?
-Yes sir.
Everybody,
I go by Joker Gang,
Joker Ganggang, Joker 305,
rawest chico alive.
Name's Gum Gang,
Florida's craziest
hillbilly stuntman.
And I'm a content creator.
I do backwoods
crazy hillbilly shit.
Aah!
My ultimate goal
to followers
is get over two million.
I've been shot
with potato launchers,
Gum Gang:
Smoked out of a bass's ass.
You gotta find you
a decent rod
and shove it
right up its ass,
make sure it got
a little airway,
put a pipe on its asshole,
give it mouth-to-mouth,
and just fire away.
Oh, my goal is to have
a million followers
and be verified.
What he does,
he shoots potato guns
at his balls,
smokes out of a fuckin' fish.
Know what?
I made World Star
more than that nigga
made World Star.
He's like, what?
He's five times World Star.
Only little pussies brag
about that.
Bro, I made World Star
so many times, I lost count.
I'm so viral that
I should be bigger than I am.
I could retire right now.
My name'll
be way bigger than his.
Man, the whole story started
'cause my girlfriend
was showin' me
Joker's Instagram page,
and he sent her
some red hearts.
I said, "Hey, don't get
in my girlfriend's DMs no more."
Joker Gang:
She was a flirt with me,
you know.
She's, like, "Oh, I got
a boyfriend and shit,
Gum Gang."
I go, "Fuck Gum Gang.
You know, girl, I'll rock
your world, you know?"
Shit, I'm handsome.
I'm clean.
It was my first love
on Instagram.
When I was single, I was fuckin'
all the bitches, you know.
Every cute girl
that would follow me, click,
and then I send 'em
red hearts.
Then he started
sendin' me red hearts
and wouldn't stop.
So I told Gum,
"Hey, can you
let him know, like,
to, to leave me alone?"
And then it was on
after that.
He said, "Oh, who are you?
Ba-ba-ba."
Joker Gang:
Fucking inbred motherfucker--
Some Gum Gang motherfucker,
you'll see.
Announcer:
It's the much-awaited,
much-anticipated
fight of the century.
Joker Gang versus Gum Gang.
Make some fuckin' noise
if you're ready.
Commentator:
Here we go, Miguel.
Joker Gang:
I knew he wasn't
gonna have the cardio
to fight three rounds.
I already knew
what his game plan was.
He was gonna throw
hellmakers.
He was gonna throw hellmakers
and try to get
the first knockout
he can get.
So I was just doin'
my thing,
gettin' him against the ropes,
lettin' him gas up.
Then I chased
that nigga down and blam,
dropped him from the first
30 seconds of the fight.
Announcer:
And the winner is Joker Gang.
Gum Gang:
Beginnin' of the fight,
I didn't realize
how much anxiety I have.
The liquor kicked in, and I was
so fuckin' off balance, man.
It was shit outta shit match,
you know.
It was a loss.
Took the L and move on.
Hey, you don't see me
cryin' about it
like everyone else did
at the fuckin'--
for the presidency.
And everyone was all, like,
"Boo-hoo."
Fuck it.
It is what it is.
You take your L
and you move on.
You know what I'm saying?
Just keep goin'.
We are going to keep on winning,
-winning, winning.
-Crowd: winning, winning.
Crowd:
Four more years.
Four more years.
Four more years.
That seems like a good way
to start the movie.
It's, like, they're both
like a fight.
They're both like a battle.
My name's Andrew Callahan,
and I first went viral online
for interviewing people
on Bourbon Street
about their deepest,
darkest secrets at 2:00 a.m.
and posting them on Instagram
the next morning.
I lost my virginity
to my cousin.
I fucked her dad.
Sometimes I like
to eat booty.
After I graduated,
I decided to take
that show on the road.
So I moved into an RV,
and I drove
all around the country
goin' to different
conventions,
conspiracy rallies,
music festivals,
stuff like that.
White Claw!
-Rawr.
-Show me your butthole!
Then in 2020,
shit got super serious.
Protests, pandemics.
Remember that?
Is the way about to go it?
No.
But is everyone perfect? No.
Everybody cough in my face.
Do it.
Somebody come cough in my face.
Prolonged lockdown
basically is slavery.
Freedom!
Freedom! Freedom.
This is the story
of the events
that led up to
the January 6th Capitol riot
as I saw them unfold.
Reporter 1:
2020 of course
gave us plenty to talk about.
Reporter 2:
The year in politics
no one saw coming.
Anderson Cooper:
It's been an incredible
and unprecedented year
of change.
Reporter 3:
2020 will be a year
we'll remember
for the profound ways
it has forever
changed our country.
Andrew Callaghan:
Well, I think that now
that so much time has passed,
like, people forget
how crazy it felt
to be in that moment
in time.
Like, in that period of time
after the protests,
mid-pandemic,
right before the 2020 election,
it really felt like
we were heading into, like,
a legitimate, I guess,
like, a second Civil War.
Uh, I mean, it's funny now,
'cause that didn't happen,
right?
But the news media told us
that it would happen.
Big government Joe Biden
is promising
a full socialist takeover.
Trumpism is something akin
to a fascist social
and political movement.
Andrew: Both sides
of the mainstream media
competed for views
by showing us
the worst of the worst
from the other side
and creating
the ultimate domestic enemy
to fear
and, just maybe, fight.
And it actually worked.
By election season,
Tucker Carlson was
the most-watched show
on television,
with Chris Cuomo
and Rachel Maddow
not far behind.
So news basically
replaced reality TV.
And for four months straight,
all main TV channels
ran a 24-hour news cycle
based upon fear and predictions
of a disaster
just around the corner.
But TV news aside,
it really was social media
that became
the ultimate war zone.
Vice President Mike Pence:
Bias against minorities
is a great insult...
...to the men and women
who serve in law enforcement.
If you have a problem
figurin' out
whether you're for me
or Trump,
then you ain't Black.
The Biden crime family's
stealing the election.
The media's covering it up.
The Biden crime family's
stealin' this election.
Joe Biden's covering up
this election. He's stealing it.
Andrew:
So we figured
we'd kick this thing off
by finding the most radical
social media user we could.
So our research expert, Evan,
started digging around
on "free speech" platforms
like Parler and BitChute,
full of mostly, like,
right-wing users
who had been kicked
off Facebook
for medical
misinformation policies
talkin' about COVID,
stuff like that.
And he found this guy named
the Inglorious Patriot.
Halloween is a demonic party.
On Halloween,
more baby-eating pedophiles
come out
than on any other day.
On top of that,
today Q has stated
that "The election is going to
be stolen from President Trump."
The mainstream media
will never have the cojones
to cover
this Satanic activity.
And so we tracked him down.
And we went to his trailer
in North Carolina.
Dave Todeschini: Alright,
my name is Dave Todeschini,
and I started in social media
on my original
YouTube channel
called Covfefe with Dave.
Then it went
to World in Revolt,
next For Truth USA!,
Inglorious Patriots,
one, two, three, four,
five, six.
I'm up to 11 now,
ten or 11.
Basically, I have knowledge
that is kinda like intuitive.
Satanic ritual abuse.
Psy-op. Pizzagate.
Child trafficking.
Hillary Clinton.
John F. Kennedy.
And then when you say,
"Wow, this fits here,"
the, the pieces of the puzzle
only fit together one way.
The whole government
is compromised.
Every one of them.
These people are not human.
They're not.
They don't,
they don't do human things.
I mean, alien X-Files-type shit.
I mean, really.
I mean, humans do not do
these things
to other human beings.
They've been sacrificing
children to Molek.
That is a fact.
It's in
Hillary Clinton's emails.
Andrew:
Dave was an avid believer
in the conspiracy theory QAnon,
which is that one
or perhaps a small group
of high-level
military officials
were sending out coded messages
on the image board 8chan,
exposing a cabal
of Satan-worshipping pedophiles
like Hillary Clinton
and Bill Gates,
who want to turn us
into unarmed, vaccinated sheep,
unlike Trump,
who will save the world.
The endgame of Q's prophecies
was supposedly
a mass arrest event
called The Storm.
Dave:
I took an oath in 1969
to defend my country
from all enemies foreign
and domestic.
And if you don't think
that I can pick up
one of those weapons
I showed you
and defend my country,
you're outta your fuckin' mind.
You might kill me,
but I'll get a whole
goddamn bunch
of you's before I do that.
So what do you think's
gonna happen next?
One of two things
is gonna happen.
Either these people
get arrested,
or you're gonna have
another Revolutionary War.
Reporter:
Security ramped up
in Washington, D.C.
in anticipation
of potential election unrest.
Andrew:
Dave wanted to go
to D.C. for election day,
but he actually wasn't allowed
to leave the state
for some reason.
So we met up
with his fellow patriot,
Dick, from Alaska.
♪ Yeshua ♪
♪ We love you, Jesus ♪

♪ Wey-oh ♪
Why are you using
a Native American instrument?
Why? You are
a culture appropriator.
-Culture appropriator.
You steal their children,
you rape their women.
How can you use
something that came
from something
that you killed off?
You killed off
a whole community.
Why are you here
if you cannot take the heat?
All that stuff
is all this planned
for the New World Order
and the global--
globalists, you know.
The, uh, globalists.
-Who?
-What?
-Who?
Uh, the globalists.
Our country is occupied
by globalist forces.
This is pure globalist.
Power-hungry globalists.
You know what
a globalist is, right?
-You know what a globalist is?
-Who are they?
-Who are they?
Well, you know...
You know who they are
as well as--
I don't--
I'm not very good
at details and facts,
but lot of,
lot of these people
I think are actually
sellin' their souls.
And they hurt people,
and they hurt property.
And that's wrong.
Maybe it's your truth,
but don't tell me
it's my truth.
I love you.
Callahan Hatfield:
How many, how many
of Trump's girlfriends
do you think have had
to have abortions?
I'm not gonna argue
with it. I'm...
So Trump is
a vile human being
void of human decency
who happens
to be morbidly obese.
He's not as tall
as he says he is.
He has an issue
with his hair
and also, um, an issue
with his penis.
I think it's kinda like
a funny shape, small like that.
He's Y, and he protrudes
in the front and in the back.
And he always talks
about women's appearances,
like that's the most
important thing.
And obviously it's not.
Trump's vocabulary is that
of perhaps a fourth grader.
Everything is good and big.
And we're all gonna win.
Trump is going to go
to prison in 2022,
and he's going to get raped.
And again, I'm really
not that political.
I just thought I'll go
to the White House
to see what's going on.
-Ah! Oh, my God.
Why are you here if you
cannot take the heat? Why?
Andrew:
And that's pretty much
what I saw in D.C.,
just a hundred-person
screaming match.
And, uh, some
of the loudest voices there
weren't even there
for the election at all.
Listen to me.
It is fuckin' serious
to take a baby boy
before he grows 21
and deprive him
of his foreskin.
Don't let them
son of a bitches cut it off.
This fuckin' DOJ,
Department of Justice,
and the FBI, they don't give
a fuck about your foreskin.
I lived up North,
the American Siberia,
and I remember how my dick
shrank down to about two inches.
I pulled the foreskin back,
and I saw the head
of my penis turned blue.
If I didn't have a foreskin,
my for--
my foreskin would have--
my-my dick would have
been frost-bitten.
Activist:
The coronavirus is a hoax.
Our immune system
is too strong.
My president bounced back
within two days.
The average African American
would have died
within two minutes.
Trump is a super God!
Shout-out to Ivanka Trump,
um, Sarah Sanders,
um, Kellyanne Conway.
Shout-outs to all of them, man.
Like, we are blessed.
We're gonna defeat
the Crips and the Bloods.
We're gonna defeat M--
BLM, Black Lives Matter.
We're gonna defeat Antifa.
This is not a game.
It is surreal down here, Terry.
They've been playin'
Bruce Springsteen
out here, Terry.
Little bit of anxiety too
for the violence.
As night fell
on that first night in D.C.,
most of the kinda
peaceful crowd left.
And a more
militant group arrived,
a group known as Antifa,
which in recent months
at that time
had become
the ultimate strawman
of right-wing media.
Violent Antifa...
The Antifa lunatics.
The-- this Antifa thing.
A hundred and fifty
Joe Biden voters
dressed in
black paramilitary gear.
For those who don't know,
Antifa is a,
I would say, a loose network
of far-left protesters
associated with
Black Lives Matter,
but there's a little bit
of tension there.
They, uh,
they wear black blocks,
so you can't
identify them, really.
The, the weird thing
is that, you know,
right-wing
conservative media
like Tucker Carlson
and Sean Hannity,
they made it seem like
Antifa was,
like, Joe Biden's soldiers.
But most of the kids
that I talked to that night
didn't even really care
about the election.
Protester:
I don't really give
a shit about elections.
Either way, like,
we're not gonna have much,
any of the change we want.
Abolition, bro.
We gotta burn
this shit down,
but we have to build something.
Like, this house is not
gonna be there anymore.
It's gonna be like
a surplus center or some shit.
I don't know.
I'm a fuckin' communist, man.
I'm tryin' to move to Portland,
man, like, at some point.
Personally, I want
to start a commune
with some of my close friends
up in Colorado.
Anarcho-communists.
That's basically it.
If you need anything,
you get it. There is no money.
When you start
to rebuild the country,
what is that new country
gonna be called,
and what is it
gonna look like?
There's gonna be
lots of Indigenous nations
that are going to be--
have resurgences.
So we're gonna need
to focus on treaty building.
Do mushrooms.
It fixes your brain.
They might legalize
shrooms, marijuana,
all types of recreational drugs
for medicinal use in D.C. soon.
They've unlocked
the floodgates, baby.
Reporter:
The Biden lead now widening
in the state of Nevada.
Lester Holt: Joe Biden
is the apparent winner
in the state of Wisconsin.
Well, it's looking for certain
that Biden's going to win,
so I'm very pleased about that.
Game over, racist clown.
I do think that
he's better than Trump,
but I also think that
in general we need
to be addressing the systems
that allowed Trump to win.
We need to be abolishing
these systems,
like getting rid
of local police forces
and investing more
into the community
and more into
mental health services.
I'm also a feminist,
and I believe in equal rights
for all women,
and that includes Black women,
especially Black trans women.
I was a, a substitute teacher
in the hood, okay.
And I asked God one day,
"How do I reach my students?"
And he said,
"Become-- rap for them."
I find myself
breathin' in the Holy Ghost
where I boast in the Lord
and his holy pleasure.
I call myself
an Oreo cookie inside out.
I connect more with
the African-American community.
I have a love for 'em. I--
I've gone to the inner city
and done work.
I love the
African-American community.
Black Lives Matter
as an organization
has a lot of undercurrents.
God bless them.
And you know what?
They're fighting for a cause,
and they're getting paid.
They don't have any other way
to make money.
They are getting paid
$20 an hour
for 12 hours
a day to protest.
George Soros.
98 percent of the media's
gonna lie to you,
because they have
a leftist agenda
to bring in socialism,
communism,
and a one-world government.
COVID was a plan
to bring in, uh,
mail-in ballots
and to steal an election
at the end of the day.
Trump won in--
won in a landslide,
but now somehow overnight
they're finding
hundred of thousands of ballots
only for Biden.
The sad part is that you--
we aren't even being given
the facts anymore.
And so that's why
I just say,
I'll say it, like,
Alex Jones knows the truth.
Andrew:
Alex Jones, Alex Jones.
Pretty much
everybody knows him.
He's basically
the most famous
conspiracy theorist
of all time.
I don't like 'em
puttin' chemicals in the water
that turn
the friggin' frogs gay!
Reporter:
He has the ear
of our current president.
And I think
we'll be speaking a lot.
Andrew:
And for years,
he had one of the biggest shows
on YouTube called InfoWars .
But after being de-platformed
for calling the Sandy Hook
shooting a hoax...
They staged Sandy Hook.
The evidence
is just overwhelming.
Andrew:
...he is now only allowed
to post on his own website,
where he's probably getting
10 percent
of the views
that he used to get.
But for the first time
in years,
his numbers were starting
to pick back up,
because he promoted
conspiracy theories
about a rigged election.
God bless some of the rare
media channels right now
that are gonna
tell you the truth.
They could embed things
in the software
and even in the chips
to alter our votes.
TikTok is connected to what?
A thousand Chinese
porn websites.
You know, when they talk
about container
or, or cages,
they're actually talking
about virtual containers.
Joe Biden's
containing children.
When you have a foreskin,
it is more pleasurable
on the woman.
A man without a foreskin
is like a carrot
going in and out, a carrot.
Remember Hercules,
he had a foreskin.
Olympian power.
John Berman:
You may have gone to bed
thinking this election
was headed one way,
and then you woke up
and you saw things
were different
and trending increasingly
in another direction.
Reporter 1:
Pennsylvania's still red
but starting to shift as well.
Reporter 2:
Biden has been getting
about 70 percent
of the mail-in ballots.
Andrew:
By the time I got to Philly,
shit was popping off.
As more mail-in ballots
rolled in,
Pennsylvania flipped from red
to blue overnight.
This was
a huge loss for Trump.
And within hours,
the Trump team actually sued
the state of Pennsylvania
claiming that pollsters
in Philly
were rigging ballots
for Biden.
President Trump
has won... Pennsylvania.
We have filed
for federal relief.
Yes.
What we documented in Philly
was the first ever
Stop The Steal rally.
-Protester: Count every vote.
-Crowd: Count every vote.
Protester:
Jesus Christ hates
women presidents.
Trump is an alpha man,
Joe Biden's a beta man.
One of them weirdos got
in my face with a megaphone
and yelled that I'm a faggot.
Do I look like a faggot?
I'm not knockin' anybody
that's gay.
That's not nice. That's what
they called me, Ron.
-Listen, can I tell you
why I'm pissed off?
-Andrew: Yes.
Every ounce of soda you drink,
you gotta pay
a penny-and-a-half tax.
You gotta pay a dollar
for the Coke
so the guy can make 30 cents.
-How does it make you feel?
-It's not an elected official
who should tell us what to do.
They gotta get them
outta here.
They don't belong
on either side.
Let me tell you another thing
that's pissing me off.
The election
is a steaming crock
of hog drippings.
I can't believe that,
that America,
that Americans would
really elect an idiot
who has the intellect
of a bag of carrots
along with his vice presidential
running mate,
who's a total whore.
And let's face it,
she's a whore.
Kamala Harris was
a law clerk.
Protester:
It's a personal attack--
She was a--
Shut up, jerk-off.
See, all you have
are personal attacks,
and all you have
are incoherent arguments.
Shut up, you--
'cause I got free speech.
It is legal to beat up
and maybe even kill people
who wear MAGA hats.
The cops will not do anything
to protect you.
And now I can say
I sort of kind of know
what it must have been like
to be a Jew in Germany
on January 30th of 1933.
This is a Civil War,
the second Civil War.
No evidence. There's no evidence
there's voter fraud.
I don't know where they're
getting, getting their,
their facts from.
My vote is in that,
in that, uh,
convention center,
and I want it counted.
Hopefully they hurry up
with legalizing weed
in New Jersey.
These are good things
that we're fighting for.
The Democratic Party
has gone communist.
They've gone insane.
And, and I will fight
to my death
fighting the evil
of progressive liberalism.
I'm feelin' a little militant,
I ain't gonna lie.
If it gets darker
and the lights shut off,
we're gonna probably
get bloody here.
I mean, I-- in a way,
I don't want my parents to weep.
But I'm for establishing
a strong nationalist
Christian-based nation.
Christo-Fash,
that's what we wanna do.
-Christian fascist?
-Yeah.
I, I promise you,
before inauguration,
we're gonna have
a few bodies.
I wanna see Trump supporters
turn into Antifa.
It's gonna be hilarious,
you know.
They're gonna,
they're gonna wind up attacking
the other side finally,
grow a pair.
'Cause whites in America
are basically giving up
their, their, their beliefs
to make others
feel comfortable.
And I see it as put
the whites first, you know.
Do you ever feel like
you've gone too far down
the rabbit hole, man?
Oh, um,
what-whatever I'm trying
to dig deep into
is gonna put me in a grave.
I know that.
And then the more,
the more you dig,
the closer you are
to your own grave.
Uncle Jeff:
Hey, Andrew.
It's your uncle, Jeff.
Listen, I know,
uh, you're in town.
I was hoping
you can do me a favor.
I wanted to see
if you would be able
to watch Roman
for a little while.
Just don't take him out
and get him involved
in any weird shit
that you guys are doin'.
Let me know if you can do it.
See ya.
Andrew:
In the midst of what felt like
the calm before
a massive shit storm,
I was put in charge
of a real-life kid
for 24 hours.
My dude, what's up, bro?
You wanna check it out?
Dah, dah, dah-duh, da-da.
Here we are.
Both: Naahhh!
Andrew:
How's 2020 been for you so far?
Andrew:
What is the coronavirus?
Andrew:
Okay, fill us in.
What's going on
with the election?
Reporter:
In the middle of a pandemic,
almost 150 million
Americans voted.
President Donald Trump:
No, I'm not thinking about
concession speech
or acceptance speech yet.
Losing is never easy,
not for me, it's not.
Andrew:
The morning after
I hung out with Roman,
the final results
for the election were in.
Bi-i-i-i-du-uh-un!
Former Vice President Joe Biden
has been elected President
of the United States.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Person: Wa-hoo!
How about that Joe Biden?
Whoo.
Both: Biden.
I wanted him to win,
and he won.
Yeah.
This election took forever,
and so we're so happy
to, like, have a result
and it's the one we wanted.
Kamala is in the White House.
Joe's in the House!
Joe's in the House.
It's a beautiful day
in America.
This dude, that's my homeboy.
He bisexual. I seen him
with a bitch on one side
and a, no homo,
good-lookin' dude on the other.
He got paid $1,500,
and they all went
big deep up in Trump.
-What?
-Yeah.
-What do you mean?
-They were fucking Trump.
Had, like, a threesome
with Trump.
Came on his face
and all that shit.
Motherfucker suckin' dick.
God bless America.
I designed this flag
on my balcony
in the middle of a pandemic,
and I'm proud of this country
for pulling through.
I'm so fuckin' happy.
Happy we got
this fucking cockroach
out of town, baby.
-Woo-hoo!
What about Hunter?
Hunter Biden,
Joe Biden's son
who's a nitwit,
a drug addict,
got kicked out of the Navy.
But his dad
became vice president.
Nobody's talkin'
about Hunter.
How come Hillary Clinton's
not in jail?
You can give me the finger
all you want, bro.
I believe that he got robbed,
but I don't believe Joe Biden's
gonna be the president
once the courts
are through with him.
And I'm gonna tell you
somethin' that's really bad.
I didn't vote, but Donald Trump
started somethin'
that they can't stop.
Yo, fuck Donald Trump.
Yo, suck my dick, nigga.
Reveler:
Suck my dick, Joe!
Suck my dick, Joe!
Donald Trump,
we smokin' you tonight.
We're smokin' on
that Trump hat, girl.
Suck my fuckin' dick, nigga.
Suck my dick.
-Yeah!
-Yeah!
Fuck Donald Trump.
Suck my dick.
Donald Trump,
suck my dick, nigga.
-Fuck you.
-Person: Fuck that nigga, Trump.
You are Queens in the building.
They can suck my dick.
Fuck Donald Trump!
Fuck Donald Trump!
Suck my dick, Donald Trump!
He helped with the scammin'
and shit,
but he's out of here now.
We don't need him no more.
Can I just say,
Señora Vice President.
Crowd:
Yeah!
This is
for Donald Trump fool!
Eh-hah, fuck Trump.
Tequila.
I love him. He's so hot.
Him and Barack Obama are, like,
the hottest presidents.
I loved Obama.
I don't love Joe Biden.
We gotta, we gotta,
we gotta check him
every now and then,
you feel me?
I think
he's a great placeholder.
I think we'll be able to make
progress in the meantime.
And I'm happy to have
somebody who is enough.
I don't personally fuck
with Kamala,
and I don't politically fuck
with her either,
but she's kinda sick.
She's a Scorpio.
-What's your sign?
-I'm a Taurus.
That's the best sign!
I think everyone here
is delus--
deluding themselves,
but, you know, that's okay.
We're all here to have fun.
Biden won.
I guess Trum--
everyone can go back to brunch.
Everyone can just, you know,
weed's legalized,
heroin's legalized,
so just tap out.
Whoo!
Democracy forever, dude.
We did it.
We saved the country.
Fuck yeah.
We saved the country.
Whoo! Everything's
all amazing right now, man.
It's a big party forever.
Person in pig mask:
Neither one of them
is gonna help us out at all.
It's revolution time.
We back to
regularly scheduled racism.
They need to change the judges.
We need new rules.
We need new laws.
We need a new world.
What does your sign say?
The sign says,
"This is only the beginning."
What's the end?
There is no end.
People starving,
people dying,
people have no jobs,
people sick.
Everything is wrong.
It's time to get, to make change
on this planet.
Rich get richer,
and the poor get poorer.
This is only the beginning.
You know,
while the left kinda drifted
into this new period
of fragmented disunity,
the right wing
was tightening up.
And, uh, within a week
they organized an event called
the Million MAGA March
where one million
Trump supporters
pledged to hit the streets
of D.C. in the, uh,
the largest-ever rally
to Stop The Steal.
Person:
This is only the beginning...
Protester:
And we're winning!
The Satanist pedophiles
the Democrats represent
knew the world awakening
was here.
They control the corporations.
They control Hollywood.
They control the blue cities
and blue states
and other governments.
And they're gonna stay
locked down
until you all go on welfare
so they can force you
to waive your rights
to be forcibly inoculated.
Alex Jones:
We declare independence
from the enemy
of America, CNN.
Crowd:
Yes.
And we declare independence
from that Communist
Chinese agent Joe Biden
and his demonic
pedophile family.
Never submit to Satan
and these globalist pedophiles,
and we will defeat
their new world order. Amen.
I don't consciously
make stuff up for an audience.
I've got stacks of news
that is just the craziest stuff
in the world
going on everywhere.
Uh, and people can't believe
what's real.
I mean,
animal-human clones.
Uh, they've been growing
humanoids in utero
up to term inside cows.
And we're talkin' about
30-, 40-pound babies.
They're designed, uh,
they're part bovine, part cow.
So they can
then harvest the organs.
They have spiders--
spider-goats,
goats that are part spider.
They produce body armor
out of their milk.
They tried to recruit my dad
into that in the 1980s.
He didn't get into it, but a lot
of his colleagues took the job
and, uh, never saw 'em
again basically.
By the way, that's, that's real
what I just told you.
The pedophile globalists
and their attempted
election steal
and the Clinton blackmail rings
have only summoned
the sleeping giant
that is America.
And you, you are
the tip of the spear.
Trump is our president.
Trump is our president.
Crowd:
Trump is our president!
Trump is our president!
The proletariat,
as they're called,
really likes
dumbed-down stuff.
And-and-and so it's because
I talk to them at their level.
USA! USA!
Crowd:
USA!
I think that's why
we've been successful.
I think people resonate
with the fact that this is real.
-Freedom.
-Crowd: Freedom.
-Freedom.
-Crowd: Freedom.
I also have never tried
to organize people
to offensively cross the line
and go out
and kill globalists.
All these globalist
Democrat mayors
are enemies
and the equivalent of Nazis.
And the American people
have a right and a duty
to resist
by any means necessary.
Saturday, November 14th, 2020
will be celebrated
for hundreds of years
as the second
American Revolution.
1776!
Crowd:
1776!
1776!
Crowd:
1776!
Alex Jones:
1776!
The name of my show
is Information War ,
In-fo-War, InfoWar ,
not physical war, In-fo-War.
No, when I'm being an actor,
it's very, very clear.
I eat babies.
I eat 'em every night.
I eat 'em, you know,
with barbecue sauce.
And I flew to the moon
last night with a witch.
And I took DMT
with Easter bunnies.
Now, now, that's
an example of being crazy.
I mean, this is art.
And I'm not saying
what I do politically is art.
But, but,
but everything is an art form.
Hunga-ah-hunga
hey-hungalalala.
Ooh. Oh, yeah, more.
1776.
-Andrew: More?
-I've had enough.
My fuckin' eyes. Ah!
Oh shit.
You know, i-it's, like, beauty's
in the eye of the beholder
so if you give somebody
a FEMA camp document,
no one cares about that.
But if you have, like,
a piece of toast
with the Virgin Mary on it,
well, the splash is bigger,
so the, the system
dumbs it down for them
so they can project
whatever they want onto it.
The globalists think
you're weak.
They're tryin' to take you
and your families over. Resist.
Protester:
We'll always fight.
Andrew:
Alex Jones may have
been deplatformed
from YouTube and Facebook,
but at the Million MAGA March
along with thousands
of other deplatformed patriots
pushed off the internet
and into the streets,
he was absolute king.
Think about it, right?
You got a guy who already says
that there's some massive
deep state conspiracy out
to silence him
and his followers.
And then you silence him
and his followers.
You know,
for someone like him,
that only really adds
to his credibility.
Alex Jones:
The Proletariat,
as they're called,
really likes
dumbed-down stuff.
Give me Liberty
or give me death!
No more fraud!
We need to revote
in all seven swing states.
I am one thousand percent sure
that he is going
to get it again,
four more years.
I have no doubt whatsoever.
I have never doubted it
for a nanosecond.
You know,
one thing that I wanna,
you know, make clear
about the Million MAGA March
is that at this specific march,
the vibe was very optimistic.
I mean,
I would say 95 percent
of the people at this event
thought that the election
would be overturned
within a couple days.
Crowd:
Jesus is great.
Yes!
♪ Still I love standing up ♪
♪ For my Jesus ♪
♪ Because of all
that he's done ♪
♪ For me ♪
Crowd:
♪ And that's why
I'm not afraid ♪
♪ To be counted ♪
♪ But I'm willing
to give my life ♪
♪ See I'm ready to be ♪
♪ All he wants me to be ♪
♪ To give us
a raft for the ride ♪
♪ No, I am not ashamed ♪
♪ Of the gospel ♪
♪ I am not ashamed ♪
♪ Of the gospel ♪
♪ Of Jesus Christ ♪
Crowd:
Stop the steal.
Stop the steal.
I'm inspired right now
with all these beautiful people
supporting Trump,
being awoke,
realizing what's going on
in the world right now.
And it's truth versus lies.
You can see that from the media,
from Facebook, from CNN.
My dad was just on Facebook,
and, uh, and his friend.
And they were trying
to livestream
what's happening right now.
Both of their accounts
are now,
they're, they're not
letting 'em post.
The dollar is powerful,
and it's dictating
what all of us see
on a daily basis.
So it's those,
those kinda actions
that do nothin'
but make you lose faith.
Anything with Biden
gets overlooked.
Anything with the Biden family
gets overlooked.
What about Hunter?
What if I told you
I've got pictures of Hunter,
and I got naked pictures
of Hunter doin' crack cocaine?
You know, did we look at that?
Did we look at the fraud?
Did we look at that?
No, we didn't.
We didn't look into it,
did we? No.
Andrew:
So Joe Biden's son Hunter
had a crack problem,
more specifically
a filming himself
while smoking crack problem.
He's done it, like,
four times.
One of the key stories in the,
uh, Stop The Steal mythology
is about Hunter Biden's laptop.
Basically, they think
there's way worse stuff on it
than the crack-smoking video
and that China is holding
the laptop hostage
and has successfully
blackmailed Joe Biden
in helping them
hack voting machines
and steal the election
away from Trump.
He holds the key to everything.
If that would
have been exposed,
we, we wouldn't be here
right now.
I talked to a Chinese lady
out here,
and she said that
he's in China.
Hidin' Biden.
Dave:
China bribes people.
They've been sitting
on Joe Biden's son's laptops,
plural, for years now.
They'll get you drunk,
they'll get you drugs,
and the next thing you know,
you'll wake up in bed
with a nine-year-old girl.
And they got it on tape.
So now what do you do?
You get on the wrong side
of these sons of bitches,
and they will destroy
your life.
D-denounce me
as a piece of filth,
or you might get in trouble.
I don't wanna call you that.
No. Z-Zuckerberg
and others said,
"You can only speak to me
if it's a negative light."
Th-that's
an official pronouncement.
That's not a cult
or anything.
That's not tyranny.
That's good.
Uh...
Just say,
"You're a despicable person."
Well, th-th-the algorithm
doesn't know. It's a computer.
Just say, "You are filth,
I hate you.
"I'm here
to expose you, garbage.
Alex Jones is filth.
Alex Jones is bad."
-Alex Jones is bad?
That's good.
I like the hair down.
I'm not normally gay,
but I'd kinda like to run
my fingers through it
a little bit.
Oh my gosh.
Maybe Bigfoot's hiding in here.
Oh, Bigfoot,
are you in there?
If we do not accelerate
our resistance now,
they're gonna come
after InfoWars even more, okay.
You need to understand that.
I need your prayers.
I need your financial support.
InfoWarsstore.com.
You need DNA Force Plus.
You need the fish oil.
You need vita-mineral fusion.
The fight is now.
Andrew:
If you watch an hour-long
InfoWars segment,
probably 20 minutes
of it is just
full-blown advertisements
for anti-globalist products
like Dr. Jones
extra chill Kava pills,
and a wide catalog
of T-shirts, mugs,
hats, bullet-proof vests,
flags, backpacks,
essential oils,
and all sorts of New Age
holistic supplements.
So while it was true
that everyday people
on the right
were being censored
and kicked off
social media,
it only just pushed them
to alt platforms
and into tighter
and tighter echo chambers.
And then right into the hands
of the profiteers like Alex.
It's estimated that in 2017,
Alex Jones made $10 million
selling merchandise
and subscriptions.
But that could never compare
to our businessman president
who in 2017 made $25 million
selling MAGA hats.
What's happening today in D.C.?
Just, like, out here, like,
resisting Nazis and fascists.
And of course,
they're not welcome here.
This is a very sacred space.
We're outside of
Black Lives Matter Plaza.
I think that there's a reason
that they're here
at Black Lives Matter Plaza.
I think that they're looking
to target Black people.
They're looking to target
people of color
and also members
of the LGBTQ community.
Every one
of these motherfuckers,
I want 'em to come at me,
so I can throw
some fuckin' hands.
Dude, how bout y'all come at me?
Fuck you.
Fuck Antifa.
Protester:
What do you mean?
How am I the Nazi?
You guys are the ones
breakin' a bunch of shit.
Answer me that.
Person:
Get the fuck outta here, bitch!
-Hey, get off.
BLM Protester:
So we're all warnin'
when we see them comin'
through
Black Lives Matter Plaza
with their Trump gear on.
They're takin' pictures of us
to put up on
their racist websites.
That's a sign right there.
What they were tryin' to do
was incite hatred
and violence.
And as you can see,
it has manifested itself
over this weekend.
Reporter:
Overnight, fireworks exploding
in the streets of D.C.
At least 20 arrests made.
So one thing that I learned
from covering events like this
is that when
there is violence,
you know, in political contexts
like this,
it's pretty much always
between Antifa
and their mortal enemy,
the Proud Boys.
Person:
The Proud Boys
are best described
as a fringe group
on the far right.
Andrew:
The group was founded in 2016
by a Canadian hipster
named Gavin McInnes,
who also co-founded
Vice magazine.
Women do earn less in America
because they choose to.
Andrew:
His rants on Fox News
garnered him
a small cult following,
but in 2017,
a first-degree Proud Boy
and neo-Nazi
named Jason Kessler organized
that infamous rally
in Charlottesville, Virginia
that turned violent
and resulted in the death
of a protester.
Shortly after Charlottesville,
Gavin McInnes stepped down,
and, uh, he was replaced
by an Afro-Cuban
gun rights activist from Miami
named Enrique Tarrio.
I'm a person of color, right?
I'm Cuban.
So our message
has never been about race.
So Enrique had just spent
six months in a federal prison
for selling millions
of dollars' worth
of expired diabetic test strips
on the streets of Miami.
He was sort of brought in
pretty clearly
to try to rebrand
the Proud Boys
as some kind of anti-racist,
free speech guardian group.
So I went
to go find Enrique
and figure out what he was doing
in D.C. that day.
Enrique Tarrio:
They'd been using
the word "resist"
for the past four years.
And I think "resist" is,
is such a dumb word.
Because "resist"
means that you're,
you're put on the defense.
A revolt is,
is a better word.
And it doesn't mean
that it has to be violent.
I'm saying, like, we need
to go on the offense.
The Proud Boys go out
and protect the innocent.
They go out
and protect the people
exercising
their first amendment.
The Rufio punch,
that's the legend,
most legendary pun--
it's the punch heard
around the world.
You were in the zone, man.
You're like, it's like
a video game.
Ethan Nordean:
Yeah, Gavin McInnes says,
you know,
"Violence isn't great,
but justified violence
is amazing."
That you just have
to eliminate them as a threat.
I, I can't imagine
what would have happened
if we weren't there. Um...
Uh, he literally knocked
the soul
out of this little
soy boy Antifa.
-Knocked the soul out--
-Guy was attacking him
with a baton--
Yes, he was attacking him
with a baton, absolutely.
It was self-defense
100 percent.
The founding fathers didn't
envision, like, this, right?
They didn't envision
all of this, all these beauti--
the--
this beautiful infrastructure.
They, they didn't--
Person 1: What's up?
Person 2:
Hey, we're just
checkin' you out.
Person 1:
You think what you're doin'
will scare me?
I will fuck
one of y'all up.
Then do it. Then fuck it up.
Come on, hit me.
Come on, Pussy.
Well, so I came all the way
over here to hit you?
You said you were
gonna fuck me up, right--
Listen, we asked you
a question.
You don't know me. You don't
know nothin' I'm about.
You motherfuckers is stupid.
Until you keep
fuckin' running your mouth.
Shut the fuck up.
You guys are arguing
with a fuckin' retard.
You're, you're playing
fucking chess with a pigeon.
If we were what
the mainstream media said,
that kid would--
that guy would have been
demolished immediately.
-Yep.
-If we were what the mainstream
media claims us to be,
he would have been done.
Cameras or no cameras,
he would have been done,
if we were who they say we are.
We're, we're some
ultra-right wing
racist, violent, uh,
street gang they call us, right?
Then why didn't we just beat up
that Black man right there?
And we just proved it
right there.
The truth is we're not,
we're not like these,
this violent mob
of a gang or anything.
And if my presence
is provocation,
then, you know what,
so be it. I'll take it.
Andrew: For sure.
Can we check your shirt out?
Enrique:
I am a Western Chauvinist,
and I refuse to apologize
for creating the modern world.
Proud Boys is
a drinking club.
We're a drinking club
with a patriot problem.
We're a drinking club
with a patriot problem
is what we are.
It's a men's group.
It's a drinking club.
Patriot club.
Actually, no, I'm sorry.
A drinking club
with a patriot problem.
I don't drink.
No.
This is actually--
that's why it's full.
I haven't drank in,
like, 12 years.
I thrive in the, the anarchy
of, of all this shit.
I, I had
a pretty cool childhood.
You know, I was
a little rebellious fuck.
I used to break into cars.
We used to steal cars.
Nissans are pretty easy.
You hotwire 'em.
Hondas are super easy,
same thing.
High-end cars,
you need keys.
You want to say
I'm guilty of something else?
Manipulating fuckin'
mainstream media? Yes.
Proud Boys is
a drinking club.
-With a--
-Is that how
you would define it?
-Okay.
-Yeah.
Andrew:
So how do you make money?
Enrique:
I started this, this shop
called 1776.shop.
And we sell all sorts
of conservative merchandise
and apparel.
We started this store
as a hobby.
T-shirts, mugs, hats.
I'm a T-shirt mogul,
T-shirt king.
Ha!
When we get on the news,
we'll do about $5,000,
$10,000 a day.
Think our best day
for business
was when Biden
mentioned us in the debates.
-Proud Boys.
Proud Boys, stand back
and stand by.
I might have left-wing sites
that sell
left-wing merchandise.
Andrew:
You make Joe Biden merch?
Maybe.
I know how to put food
on my table.
Like, you could
take away my status.
You could take away
my voice.
I'm gonna find a way
to do something.
We're a drinking club
with a patriot problem.
Alex Jones:
It is more important than ever
in the third dimension,
here on the ground,
that bumper stickers,
license plates, T-shirts,
because if you're watching
and listening
to this transmission
and taking action,
you are the resistance.
Ah, well,
these guys came in,
you guys came in
for a fuel filter replacement.
Yeah, well, we found
a cock in the block.
-What?
-A cock in the block.
There's a rooster nesting up
under the undercarriage in here.
-Like an actual live chicken?
-Yes, sir.
Mechanic:
What the fuck?
-Andrew: Is it alive or dead?
-Mechanic: It's alive.
And if you feel as though
he needs to get outta there,
I feel like you guys
should crawl up under there
and get that chicken
out of there, personally.
Friend:
You see it?
Andrew:
Yeah. There's a chicken
in the RV.
He looks fuckin' scared, man.
-Friend: He's scared?
-Andrew: Yeah.
-Andrew: Oh shit! Oh fuck!
Reporter: Hundreds
of Trump supporters gathered
at rallies
across Atlanta today
protesting the results
of the presidential election
here in Georgia.
Andrew:
As the echo chamber
grew smaller and smaller
and Biden's inauguration
drew closer and closer,
Patriots became angrier
than ever.
Protester:
CNN sucks.
CN suck-- CNN sucks.
CNN is taking
a massive, pffff,
crap on this country.
They took a bunch
of laxatives,
and they're just crapping
all over the American flag.
They're crappin' all over
the National Anthem.
Trump doesn't poo
on the American flag.
President Trump diarrheas
in Joe Biden's mouth.
Joe Biden loves
that Trump diarrhea
right in his mouth,
right all over his face.
This is a stolen election
through this
crap right here.
There's what
the socialists are usin'
to take our country.
No more mail-in ballots,
Mr. Mailbox.
Damn it to hell!
Andrew:
And for the first time,
I heard talk of a coup.
I pray for peaceful revolution,
but I'm prepared
for a violent revolution.
When tyranny becomes law,
rebellion becomes duty.
A-and that's where I'm at.
Will you accept Joe Biden
as your president?
Fuck no. Bushmaster AR-15,
Smith & Wesson 40 cal.
I-I'm locked and loaded
and ready to roll.
There has to be blood.
This is a communist revolution.
And I'll tell you
right now, bro.
I'm fuckin' in here, man.
Ready to die for my country.
We don't want that shit, man.
It's capitalism,
not communism, man.
I love guns.
I love this country.
That's all it is to it.
Fuck Antifa.
Fuck CNN too. Fake news.
Does anybody in the world
that's not watching CNN
-think that this is
an honest election?
-Person: Yeah!
If you do,
then I feel sorry for you.
The part-- the time
for praying is done.
Jesus was not a pacifist.
When he saw the tyranny,
he turned over the tables.
This is it.
This is the tyranny.
Andrew:
Despite the fighting words
of a lot of these people,
nobody was sure exactly how
or when this coup
was gonna go down.
It was more abstract.
And to add insult to injury,
Antifa was on scene
yelling at
InfoWars subscribers,
QAnon followers,
and militia members
about the KKK.
Group:
No Trump, no KKK,
no fascist USA!
No Trump, no KKK,
no fascist USA!
No Trump, no KKK,
no fascist USA!
No Trump, no KKK,
no fascist USA!
How did they gather
those folks?
Excuse my language.
And who the fuck's paying them?
George Soros's son
has already had evidence
against him
with these folks down here.
We think that they're trying
to steal our election.
Who's bussin' 'em in?
Group:
No Trump, no KKK,
no fascist USA!
We knew that
there were white supremacists,
Proud Boys, and InfoWars
in our city,
so we just wanted to make sure
they're not welcome here.
The Proud Boys
are gonna fuckin' come at us.
We got one. We got the leader
right fuckin' there
in my goddamn city.
I would say
that I am an anarchist,
a socialist, a communist.
I believe in socialism
because I want the,
I believe that the workers own
their right to production.
Starbucks employees
should be able to own
the machines
that make the coffee.
But above all else,
I'm anti-fascist.
When Donald Trump
takes over office,
you guys are the ones
goin' to jail
for being like this
at this event, bro.
Are you really gonna wear
the muzzle?
Like, you look like livestock
walkin' around.
'Cause, look, your entire body's
covered in holes,
so why cover the one part
that shows your personality?
Where, where are all the holes
that your body is covered in?
Have you ever heard of a pore?
Do you sweat?
So we're full of holes.
Do we agree? Are you a stone?
Listen to me, lady.
You see that tower right there?
That's called 5G, okay.
Right there, right there,
right there, right there.
60 millihertz.
You're walking around basically
on chemotherapy.
Biden's a child molester.
And he kidnaps children
and does horrible things
to them,
just like Hillary Clinton
and Obama who made the virus.
The virus is manmade.
It doesn't exist.
Kids need to be
put back in school.
The people who are pulling
the strings
is the Italian Vatican.
They actually are
reptilian bloodlines
from another planet.
They're basically robots.
And the evil people
that are there
such as the Rothschilds
who suck blood of,
out of children
to get adrenaclome
and stay young
and beautiful forever.
They pick 'em up,
and they take 'em to a submarine
and go underground until they
can get to Epstein island,
which is where
they molest children.
Child:
That's the ice breaker.
Group: Ohhh!
Child 1:
Hey, get that thing off.
-Child 2: Stop!
Uh-oh, he's got the pistol.
Get him. Ah, ah, ah.
Head shot.
-Person: Whoa, whoa!
I went to McDonald's today,
and I wanted
to get a muffin.
And I found human teeth
in my muffin.
Andrew:
Uh-oh. So, so what's,
what's inside McDonald's food?
Um, I think it's, like,
ground-up children.
People do evil shit,
that's it.
And these people have
plenty of opportunity,
they got more money than God.
I think the military's
gonna arrest
the whole damn government.
Some people say
that there's gonna be
a blackout,
no television except for,
um, Donald J. Trump screening
on live news.
And what he's gonna do
is he's going to,
um, lock up all
the other pedophiles
and reptilian bloodlines
and put them in jail.
Where do you get
your information from?
The dark stream media.
Like I said,
what you have to do is
you have to go search
around the normal media
for someone who knows how to get
into the dark stream media.
And another pl-- good place
to track is the Trump media,
which is actually
telling all the truth.
At this point, I'd never
actually gone on a Q board.
So for the first time,
I had Jayden's dad, Brandon,
take me headfirst
into QAnon.pub,
which is the main Q board.
Brandon Spencer:
Let me see here.
Now you have to understand
that he speaks
in, in cryptic code.
There's actually a Q clock
that you have to decipher
all this stuff from.
Andrew:
So this, this is
an actual Q drop?
Brandon:
Yup. Anderson Cooper.
And you can see
all the Satanic, uh, artwork
in the background,
which is just, just troubling.
I mean, you have a man here
getting burned alive
while there's some sort
of Satanic ritual
going around
in the background.
I see
that sacrifice is misspelled.
Do you think
that's also cryptic?
Brandon:
Yeah, absolutely.
These, these guys are smart.
Anything that's misspelled,
anything that looks out
of the ordinary,
there's something to it.
The purpose of the movement
is to,
is to question everything.
Inside the pepper,
you have that upside down
kinda triangle, if you will.
This is the sign
for a boy lover, right here.
Whoo. Go Trump.
He's still your president!
He's still your president!
He's still your president!
Mother:
They are very, very good kids.
We're very blessed,
and that's why I'm comfortable
with making the decision
to keep them out of school,
even if that means
they don't have
all the friends to be around.
And, you know,
I don't want
my kids wearing masks.
Andrew:
Do you guys miss
going to school?
-Um, yup.
-Um, very much.
It's, um, it's, it's not the--
the virus is manmade
like my dad said,
so it's worthless
not going to school.
But we're gonna have
to wear the mask, like,
for 24/7 if we have to go back,
except, like, on weekends.
Imagine if
the coronavirus never exists,
would you like
to go back to school?
Um, yeah. I really like--
I miss all my friends.
My mom, my mom is saying that
'cause she wants
to home-school us,
but the only thing that's
holding her back is our friends.
I don't have a lot of friends.
I just have, like, one or two.
You have a t-- I have zero.
Andrew:
You have zero? Come on,
everyone has one friend.
-I'm your, I'm your friend.
-You have us at least.
-Okay.
-Andrew: Yeah.
Which friend
do you miss the most?
-Um, probably, like, Kaitlin.
-Andrew: Why?
'Cause she's, like,
the only one who gets me.
Mother:
It's sad that they don't have
a lot of friends to play with
but I think in the long run,
they'll be better adults,
having a better education
than being popular.
Reporter:
Breaking news
just in from Atlanta.
The police chief
just stepping down
in the wake of a deadly
officer-involved shooting.
An attempted arrest
in a Wendy's parking lot
turning to a struggle
over a stun gun.
Ask yourself.
How do you think you would do
regardless of what color
you are
if you snatched a cop's taser
and tried to shoot him
with it?
Most likely you'd be dead.
Person:
Look. Look behind you.
Look. Look at this shit
right here.
You see this man,
Rayshard Brooks?
Police just brutally murdered
a man right here.
Didn't even give a fuck.
You feel me?
Protester:
Say his name.
Group:
Rayshard Brooks.
Andrew:
Shortly before my meeting
with the Spencer family,
a 27-year-old man
named Rayshard Brooks
had been killed
by police officers
in a Wendy's parking lot.
Protests erupted,
which resulted
in the burning of the Wendy's
and the accidental killing
of a young girl
due to a stray bullet.
He was, he was,
he came to get some food
for his family
from the Wendy's.
He was a little intoxicated,
you feel me?
So he parked his car
in this parkin' lot.
-Fell asleep.
-Fell asleep in the car.
The police got him out the car,
asked him some questions.
And that shit went left.
It wasn't Black people
that burned this Wendy's down.
Who, who burned
the Wendy's down?
It was actually
a Caucasian female.
Then a little girl
got killed right there
in the parking lot we just left
before gettin' the bottle.
Person 1:
A little girl got killed.
Person 2:
Well, that shit
took a little girl, man.
Fuck 12, man.
I love Wendy's though.
Y'all got that good
four-for-four.
I fuck with that, though.
Rest in peace, Rayshard Brooks,
Breonna Taylor,
and everybody we lost this year
to police brutality,
COVID-19, 'cause my granny
had COVID.
She beat it.
That shit is real.
Everybody take care
of their self.
More folks might start
joinin' us right now.
-We might--
we had this shit packed.
The whole street--
Oh man, here we go again
with this bullshit.
So what do you guys wanna be
when you grow up?
Basketball star.
Person:
Oh, oh, let's close the gate.
Football star.
Andrew: What do you wanna be
when you grow up?
I wanna be myself.
How's, how's 2020 been
so far for you guys?
Good and bad
at the same time.
What do you mean?
My cousin died.
He was just mindin'
his own business.
Then he got robbed, and...
Person:
Young kids get ready
for the count.
...they pulled out
a gun on him
and then shot him four times
in the back.
That's my one wish,
to see him again.
I would just give him a hug.
All three of us is brothers.
-Andrew: What'd you say?
-All three of us is brothers.
Which one of you guys
is the oldest?
Him.
We've got to show
the kids this ain't right.
Like, they gotta
look up to us. Shit.
We the next generation.
They the next generation.
Everybody tired of everything.
We're tired of sittin'
in the house.
We're tired of gettin'
fed lies, bullshit.
Hey, it don't matter
who president.
It ain't gonna never change.
Same thing gonna
always be goin' on in the world
what's goin' on now.
See what I'm sayin'?
Like, hey, only person who can
make the world better is God.
That's to me.
It really made me think about,
like, how much free time
and also financial stability
it really takes
to show face at the kind
of angry pep rallies
that I had been going to
for the past couple months
prior to that.
So many Americans'
primary concern
is just getting by,
you know?
They don't have time
to fly to D.C.,
get their Trump gear,
and just yell about shit
that's probably not
gonna happen.
It was also hard to believe
that just two miles away
from where I interviewed
those kids in the projects
was the Spencer family
household,
where they live
in absolute fear of reptiles
and Rothschilds stealing
everything from them.
I mean, they basically live
next door
to a segregated housing project
where people's primary concern
is making ends meet
and ultimately
escaping poverty.
It, it made me wonder
if it would ever be possible
to bridge that gap
in understanding
and, more importantly,
how much power
an American president
really has in a four-year term
to fix a country
with such dramatic inequality
and, let's keep it real,
poor informational literacy.
Brandon:
This is the sign
for a boy lover, right here.
At this point, I was getting,
like, so tired
of going from Trump rally
to Trump rally,
but I was invited
to actually be on stage
at the next
Million MAGA March in D.C.,
so I had to do it.
Reporter:
Today, thousands
of President Trump supporters
gathered in
the nation's capital.
Reporter 2:
This is the second
largest rally here
by Trump supporters
since election day.
We demand the truth.
Reporter 2:
This is the president's
loyal base.

Crowd:
Fuck Antifa. Fuck Antifa.
USA! USA! USA!
All I want you guys to do
is fuckin' smile and look great
for the fuckin' camera,
'cause you're a bunch
of handsome sons of bitches.
Crowd: Hoo!
-Whose streets?
-Crowd: Our streets.
-Whose streets?
-Crowd: Our streets.
Alex Jones:
Never surrender
to the globalists.
We will never surrender!
Roger Stone:
They tell us
this election is over.
-Person 1: No.
-Person 2: Bullshit--
Nothing is over
till we say it is.
Crowd: Yeah!
Never surrender,
and fight for America.
Owen Shroyer: Alright,
all you crazy motherfuckers.
Now, I heard,
I heard that you guys went out
lookin' for some Antifa.
-Person: 1776!
-Hey, this is our revolution!
-Whose streets?
-Crowd: Our streets.
-Whose streets?
-Crowd: Our streets.
-Whose streets?
-Crowd: Our streets.
Protester:
We got real-life demands
of the movement.
Defund the police,
protect Black women.
That's all fact. But right now,
I'm here to fight.
Right now, I'm here to defend
my motherfuckin' city, man.
We're here to get
the fuckin' cops
off their lazy fat asses
and do their fuckin' jobs,
'cause otherwise
these American Patriots
are gonna come out here
and do it for them.
Enrique:
Everybody's smiling.
Everybody's having
a good time.
Enrique:
The feds were smiling,
Antifa was smiling.
And, you know,
my friends were smiling.
'Cause we're enjoying this.
Enrique:
I felt like December 12th,
we usually take
a defensive stance.
And it felt like
the Proud Boys took an,
an offensive stance.
-Officer: Hey, sit down.
You don't care! You don't care
for this fuckin' country!
These are my kids!
These are my fuckin' kids
behind me!
Are you fucking people crazy?
Andrew: That night,
several of them were arrested.
And for the first time,
the Proud Boys,
whose rallies have centered
around assisting
and defending
law enforcement...
We wanted
to just get police, uh,
and law enforcement
the tools
that they need
to combat these riots.
Andrew:
...began turning
their backs on the blue.
I'm not a back-the-blue guy.
I don't wanna advertise
a pro-police message.
-I just don't.
Cop: Well, thank you--
Yeah, so, um,
after that rally in D.C.,
I started to feel
a little bit weird.
Just want to do
a COVID test.
Anybody ever thrown up
when they did it?
God fuck.
Oh.
Oh, it's super easy.
I, I did a good job.
You think I might have it?
I went to a Trump rally,
and all I got was COVID-19.
I was just in
the middle of nowhere
laying down
under my space blanket
just, like, watching, you know,
to see what would happen next.
But, you know, I knew that
somethin' bad was gonna happen
after that day in,
in D.C.
Ethan:
The movement
that started with one man,
on public access television
will tomorrow
turn into millions of Americans
in the streets
of Washington, D.C.
to take our republic back.
Crowd: Yes!
And that man's name
is Alex Jones.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Alex Jones.
The globalists are in fear.
The globalists want
to play God.
They are not God.
And the answer
to their 1984 tyranny
is 1776!
1776.
-Crowd: 1776! 1776!
-1776! 1776!
Alex Jones:
We're here to take
our rightful country
back peacefully.
Because we're not
globalist Antifa criminals.
So let's start marching,
and I salute you all.
-USA! USA! USA!
-Crowd: USA! USA! USA!
Person: Come on, patriots.
Tell Congress how you feel.
Make them hear you.
Crowd:
America First. America First.
This is Donald Trump's
Republican Party.
Let's have trial by combat.
President Trump:
Fight like hell.
And if you don't fight
like hell,
you're not gonna have
a country anymore.
Rioter: Freedom!
-Rioter 2: Donald Trump won.
Tyrants! You tyrants!
Rioter 3: Freedom!
Rioter 4: Stop the steal!
Rioter: That's all they got?
What the fuck?
Let's go.
Rioter: 1776!
Crowd: 1776!
Yeah!
Pussy-ass motherfuckers.
What they doing?
Look like a fuckin'
field trip, bro.
I woulda been breaking statues,
shitting on the floor,
pissin' everywhere,
slappin' everybody up.
-Reporter:
And they're stopping--
-What the fuck is this, bro?
Commentator:
This looks like
the easiest investigation
the FBI has ever conducted,
because these people have--
most of them have incriminated
themselves on social media.
Reporter:
The Justice Department says
about 440 people
have already been arrested.
Commentator:
We're looking at
significant felony cases
tied to sedition
and conspiracy.
Reporter 2:
U.S. Olympic gold medalist
Klete Keller charged today.
Reporter 3:
An Air Force veteran
in connection
with Wednesday's assault.
Reporter 4:
West Virginia state lawmaker
Derrick Evans
is facing charges.
Reporter 5:
Around 57 were linked
to extremist groups,
including the Proud Boys
and the conspiracy
ideology QAnon.
Reporter 6:
Authorities
arrested and charged
Proud Boys organizer
and former InfoWars host
Joe Biggs
for taking part in the riots.
Reporter 7:
They say he helped
recruit people to be there,
saying that January 6th
was going to be epic.
Reporter 8:
The prosecutor said
Ethan Nordean played
a leadership role
and was heavily involved
in the organizing of the attack
on the U.S. Capitol.
Brace Belden:
People that got their faces
all over the internet,
they're the first ones
to go down.
This is our house.
This is our house.
And that's, like, really sums up
a lot of this thing,
is, like, you finally get
these people to the edge,
it's like, "Here it is.
Do what you want,"
and all they can do is fuckin'
livestream and get arrested.
Rioter:
Wow, what a great video.
That's right. We did it.
Fuckin' A, man.
My fellow Americans,
the storm is upon us.
-Person: Yeah, it is.
-God bless.
-Person: Yeah!
-We are the storm!
I couldn't help but wonder,
to them, what the point
of all this really was.
I can't blame people for lookin'
for meaning, you know.
And, like, people look
for meaning in all sorts
of fucked up weird ways.
Reporter:
At least four people have died,
including one woman,
who was shot
by police inside
the Capitol.
Reporter 2:
President Trump is waking up
this morning without access
to some of his
social media accounts.
Reporter 3:
While chaos unfolded,
the President continued
to post conspiracy theories
with absolutely no evidence.
A lot of these people
truly believed
they'd be remembered
as American heroes.
And I can't blame them.
The lore of QAnon,
the calls for 1776
by Alex Jones,
the paramilitary muscle
of the Proud Boys,
and the actual words
of Donald Trump himself
were the perfect storm.
As I watched from the RV,
I wondered,
Where were the people
who gave them the confidence
to cross the line?
I'm not gonna lie
like the left does.
Antifa and some people
in the Proud Boys
claim they were with it,
and some people
in the Oath Keepers.
I'm not against those groups,
but some people in those groups,
not their leaders,
went there to go into
the Capitol and to do that.
What happened at the Capitol
helps the deep state.
What happened at the Capitol
helps the authoritarians.
What happened at the Capitol
is not good for any American.
And now,
anybody that types 1776
from now on is,
is an insurrectionist.
There was no plan
of action here
by anybody, period.
And if,
if somebody planned it,
man, this was a stupid plan.
Reporter:
Tarrio was not there
on January 6th.
He was arrested in D.C.
two days before
for burning
a Black Lives Matter flag
stolen from a church...
I burned it with,
uh, a lighter.
Reporter:
...and having
empty weapons magazines
that are illegal in D.C.
Amy Goodman:
Interesting that
he was arrested
right before the insurrection,
so he couldn't take part in it.
Reporter:
Reuters revealed Wednesday
Enrique Tarrio has a past
as a prolific informer
for federal
and local law enforcement
repeatedly working undercover
for investigators.
There's a difference between
informant and cooperation.
Cooperation's when
you're cooperating with the,
the federal agency
to lower your sentence.
Informing is when
you're just doing it.
In your 1776 speech
at the Million MAGA March
when you were, like, you know,
"The people
must defend themselves
by any means necessary,
1776 time,"
do you feel like
with such big crowds
there's gonna be someone there
who is, like--
doesn't see that you're talking
about an information war
and hears you yell "1776"
and has images of the
American Revolutionary War in--
I think that's fair.
I think that's fair.
But, I mean, it was also
Q people at the Capitol,
uh, who really believe that
they were there for Trump.
And they, they believed
they were there
'cause the 8chan board
was saying,
"It's the storm,
get up and take over."
Alex Jones was already
in defense mode.
He was doing whatever
he possibly could
to blame the Capitol riot
on someone that wasn't himself.
We saw Q-tards with Antifa
goin' to the Capitol
and do this,
and that's all QAnon is,
is Nigerian email scams 5.0.
And, and this is what
I get accused of
by the media
is what Q does.
The name of my show
is Information War ,
In-fo-War, InfoWar ,
not physical war,
not offensive war,
not atomic war,
not hydrogen war,
not chemical war,
not biological war.
In-fo-War.
So we're gonna
crush them with the truth.
Dear God, thank you for
all our family and friends
and protecting us.
Thank you for all the friends
that are recording
our every movement.
And thank you for this food,
all our dogs. Amen.
After this,
can we go play Nintendo with--
We got a new dog.
-You got a new dog?
-Yeah.
Got a new dog,
we got a new president.
Andrew:
Last time we were here,
we talked a lot
about the QAnon drops.
Did you feel
a little bit let down
when a lot of the predictions
of the Q universe didn't happen?
Kind of, yes,
because everything
that I researched
seemed so real.
Like, Disney and all these
horrible companies
that continue to brainwash us.
And when Q was wrong
and didn't predict anything,
basically just made it up,
it was very hard to believe
that Q was still-- existed.
Brandon:
It makes you feel like that.
It makes you feel like
it was all for nothin'.
And then what I keep
going back to is,
"Okay, if it was all bullshit,
if it all was a lie,
then what was the point?"
With my dad being into Q,
I felt like
they were manipulating him
the whole way.
Andrew:
Mm-hmm. Why?
Because they wanted
to get everybody divided.
'Cause my dad would spend
countless hours outside
by himself on his phone
watching Q
and watching
all this Trump stuff.
Andrew:
What do you feel like
the point was?
I really felt like
there was no point.
Andrew:
January 6th felt like
a fitting end
to the Trump presidency.
The true believers
were getting arrested,
while the people
who pushed them into action,
for the most part,
were nowhere to be found.
Meanwhile,
the news machine defaulted.
I am in tears today
to see this scene.
December 7th, 1941.
September 11th, 2001.
And January 6th, 2021.
We observe 9/11.
We have to observe the 6th
of January every single year.
Today was a disgrace.
What a crazy, sad day.
Right-wing media,
on the other hand,
couldn't even stomach
the fire they'd fueled.
They pretended like
nothing really happened.
All that stuff they're puttin'
on these other stations, like,
"Oh, it was
the biggest riots in history."
No, it wasn't.
If you were to listen to,
to Fox News and MSNBC
and CNN,
they were telling us
that all hell
was gonna break loose tonight,
as if this was BLM
and Antifa.
Andrew:
And not a moment passed
before Trump's
hardcore soldiers attempted
to explain it away
to fit their own narrative.
So the idea
that you're not allowed
to see the inside
of the Capitol is insane.
The idea that the public
has a clear interest
in knowing what happened
that day is real.
The Capitol Riot
is a steaming crock
of hog drippings.
Everybody was in a good mood.
They saw Trump speak.
I remember seein' people
climbin' in trees
to even get
a glimpse at this.
It was just, like,
"What a time to be alive."
Dave:
I think Nancy Pelosi
and those people
set all of that up.
They had Antifa go in
dressed as MAGA people.
Dave:
In the following video,
we dox 635 known
Antifa terrorists.
We apologize
if your name appears
and you are not Antifa.
We've been living
in a deception.
It worked for a while
until social media came along.
And social media is the one
that got Trump in, the outsider.
And he's about as far
from a pedophile
as you're gonna get.
He's after these people,
and that's why
they're after him.
Pffff. Pedophile.
Pedophile, definitely.
Because she eats the babies.
Oh yeah.
I call him creepy sleepy
chomo Uncle Joe.
What's j-- what is--
what does chomo mean?
Chomo is a,
is a jailhouse term
for child molester.
Pfff. Pedophile.
There's something I need
to talk to you about.
On May 19th, 1999,
you were convicted
of sexual abuse
in the first degree
and sodomy
in the second degree
of an eight-year-old boy
in New Jersey.
So, according to this paper,
you are a registered
sex offender
and a convicted pedophile.
On a false conviction.
-You want to take
a look at this?
-I know. I've seen the paper.
I pled, because I knew--
-Andrew: You pled guilty?
-Dave: Yeah, becau--
I did what Michael Flynn did.
I knew I couldn't win.
Have you ever heard
the term projection before?
-Andrew: Do you feel like--
-Yeah. Hillary Clinton
does it all the time.
Andrew: Do you feel like
maybe you're projecting by--
No, I'm not projecting.
I am engaging in revenge.
How are you going
to get revenge? Are you--
I'm gonna get revenge
by takin' down
the whole goddamn cabal.
Like the protagonist
in Law Abiding Citizen,
I'm gonna pull this whole
fuckin' corrupt temple down
around your fuckin' head.
And that's what I'm gonna do.
In Dave,
I sort of saw a man
projecting his own shame
and, and using the mythology
of, of Trump
and of his political movements
and conspiracies
to assign meaning
to a broken life.
To jump down
the conspiracy rabbit hole,
I think that, uh,
if you fail yourself
or you've been failed
by the world,
it provides a way out.
By the time I got back to D.C.
for Biden's Inauguration Day,
it was as if nothing
had ever happened.
The streets
were completely dead.
No Biden supporters cheering,
and no Trumpers
back for round two.
Within a couple months,
my life was basically
back to normal,
making YouTube videos
with my friends.
The news media had returned
to its perpetual crossfire.
Alex went back
to selling supplements.
Enrique went back
to selling T-shirts.
And Forgiato Blow
was back in the studio.
A lot of people got rich,
and a lot of people's lives,
and brains,
were ruined forever.
We were pitted
against each other for profit
by organizations
and individuals
who do not care about us
and are enriched
from our division.
But before this ship sailed,
I remember something
a wise man once told me.
Wise Man:
Rich get richer,
and the poor get poorer.
There is no end.
There is no end.
This is only the beginning.
