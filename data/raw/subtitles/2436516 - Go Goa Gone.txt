Change it.
The remote's close to you.
It's closer to you.
I switched on the TV.
I ordered the pizza.
I opened the door.
I rolled the bloody joint.
- I made the bloody roach.
I ordered booze. - But I paid for it.
Actually, forget it.
I don't mind this film
I love this film.
What a nice dance I tell you.
Where did you get the money? For all this?
Don't know.
This morning I gave my
pants to the laundryman..
..and found 2800 rupees in the pocket.
Jackpot!
2800?
The same amount I gave you two weeks ago..
..for paying the electricity bill.
It was two months due.
You.. didn't pay the bill.
Someone check the fuse.
Power-cut.
Power..
Power..
Fine, I'll check.
Bunny.
Bunny. - Bunny.
You all right?
Bunny? - Bunny?
Shit!
You.. - What happened?
Your face..
- Dude, is that shit on your face?
Evil-dead types!
- No, not Evil-dead. The other one.
Hollywood ghosts, right? - Yes.
Zo.. - Zom..
Zo..
"Oh! So you're back again
with a long face."
"Will you rest.. only after I'm dead?"
"You've come to suck my blood."
"Bloody Monday. Why have you
come to suck my blood."
"Thank God's the killer's asleep."
"I won't leave! I won't leave!"
"I won't leave this house!"
"You're back to suck on my blood."
"Bloody Monday. You're
back to suck on my blood."
"I won't leave! I won't leave!"
"I won't leave this house!"
"You're back to suck on my blood."
"Bloody Monday. You're
back to suck on my blood."
Yes, sir.
I've been working on it all week, sir.
We'll be ready soon.
Of course, sir. Of course, sir.
Fuck you very much, sir.
Why the stupid grin? - What's your problem?
Don't be jealous.
Why would I be?
I'm not the one getting screwed everyday!
At least pretend you're working.
It's his face, it's disturbing me.
Is this last weekend?
Nice, right?
Yeah cool pics.
Okay then, that's it.
I need a break.
I need to stretch.
I know what you mean by stretching.
You aren't going anywhere.
Look Luv, I mean it seriously.
Priyanka's just bad luck for you.
What's your problem with her?
Tell me.
Why are you so crazy after her? Tell me.
Because I.. I..
I love her.
Love?
She isn't your type, or the loving type.
Answer this.
Have you guys even..
..like even once..
No. I'm saving that for marriage.
Is it petrol, that you're saving it?
Look at yourself, Luv.
You and I had a team, dude.
Now this bitch, Priyanka..
..she's making you dance to her tunes.
What the..
WTF! Don't call my girlfriend a bitch.
Hey. FYI! I'm your best friend.
I can call her whatever I want.
And BTW! I say she's characterless.
You're heading for KLPD!
FU! I've known her for six months.
Don't say such things for her.
And IMHO! She's totally.. crazy about me.
Crazy about you? That's the
funniest thing I've ever heard.
It is funny. You won't understand.
You don't know what love is.
Love, my ass
You know what?
You opened my eyes.
I'm going to propose to Priyanka.
I'm going to change my life.
From today, no smoking, no drinking.
I'll become a nice person.
Progress in my career.
Marry Priyanka.
Have some kids.
Why are you saying such things?
Hey, Luv. Look, right now..
..I'm just 40% in my senses.
Please don't play games with me.
Hardik.
This pointless life's over for me, man!
I'm done.
I need to stretch again.
Life's simple pleasures.
Smoking, in a no-smoking office.
I've just one goal in life.
To smoke in every..
..no-smoking place in the world.
Just imagine.
How would it feel to smoke
up in the parliament?
We'll form a 'Bhartiya Joint Party'.
You're mad.
One minute.
Hold my joint.
I'll be right back.
Hold your position.
Condom, please. - Which one?
The having sex-kind!
Play longer. Extra-sensitive.
Ultra-thin, ultra-pleasure.
In flavours we have mint, vanilla,
dark-chocolate, tutty-fruity.
Which one?
Hello.
Hi.
Do you like strawberries or chocolate?
Nothing. I'm dieting. Why?
I'm getting some sweets.
Get something fruity.
Okay.
Strawberry.
Baby.
I am back.
What are you doing?
We're.. going to do it, right? - No.
You just said. - No.
Come on aren't we gonna..
Oh my, God!
Shit. - Shit boss..
I'm screwed now. It's all your fault.
You don't need to worry. You're a girl.
Just open two buttons..
..and the horny old man won't
even look at your face.
Simone!
Hey.
Hey you.
Who are you?
Spiderman?
Look here.
Show me your face.
Don't hide.
I know you.
You're.. Hardik, right?
Don't say no.
I can see the tattoo on your back.
Don't hide.
Tomorrow when you come to the office..
..I'll make you take off your shirt.
If I see that tattoo, I'll skin you alive.
Where will you go at this hour?
I'm right here.
Oh, God!
Luv. I am in deep mess.
You don't know what happened with me.
I can't believe where I jumped from.
The boss has seen me.
I broke my hand too.
Where's my stuff?
Fucker!
Where's my stuff?
Where's my shit?
How could you throw this away?
I work hard and buy these things.
And you..
Do you know what they're worth?
Oh!
Hardik. Look at yourself.
You're looking so lowly and helpless.
I feel pity on you.
I did it.
Basically, I cleaned up.
I threw everything away.
From today, no more booze, no more drugs.
Today is the beginning of my new life.
I'm sorry.
I've been..
The point is you're the
star of my new life.
Okay.
I've a surprise for you.
I don't like surprises.
No. This is a nice surprise.
Do you know that guy? - No.
The one sitting behind you.
He keeps looking.
No. I don't have any idea.
Are you sure? He looks familiar.
Just see. - I don't know him.
But you didn't..
Priyanka, take a look atleast.
No. I don't know him.
So, you... you were saying something...
..about some new life, or whatever..
Yeah..
I am starting all.. Just a second.
Hello.
What?
What.. what?
Why are you seeing us? - I was not.
You were looking at us, I know.
How do you know I was looking?
Because I saw you looking.
But, why were you looking at me?
Hello, don't use reverse logic on me.
I was looking because
you were looking at us.
I was looking because you were looking.
Nonsense. Just don't see anymore.
You don't see first.
Fucker. - Hey! I heard that.
You fucker.
You fucker first.
Say that again. Say it to my face.
Fucker! Fucker! Fucker! Fucker!
Stop it guys.
Okay. I know him.
Kapoor. - Kapoor?
How many times have I told you before?
Don't follow me around.
What did you think?
You're invisible to others?
What do you expect?
What are you still doing with him?
You were going to dump him. - What?
Come on now.
Kapoor, you've to give me some time.
How can I dump him in the
middle of the night?
You are dumping me?
Couldn't you wait?
We were going to Goa, aren't we?
You just screwed up everything.
Hang on, Goa? How long
has this been going on?
Two-three months.. - Six months!
Six months..
You've been cheating on me all this while?
Both of you're behaving like children.
Just grow up.
Grow up? Me?
Wow!
Was this my surprise? - Yes.
You like it. - Yes.
Fuck off!
Why did I do this to myself?
Why did I change? I was fine.
For her!
She was cheating on me.
Bloody ungrateful, greedy, deceiving..
- Bitch.
Bitch!
I maxed out my credit
card to buy this for her.
What?
Are you crazy, dude? You spent
your hard earned money on.. whoa!
You know what?
I'm changing from today.
Reverse gear.
Full party. Full booze, full on high.
I'll get my life back.
I will drink all the alcohol I can.
I'll do all the drugs.
Don't forget girls. - And girls.
Now, every girl will be on my radar.
Except for our family.
And if one breaks your heart..
..the only cure is another girl. - Yes,
I'm proud of you, man.
Come here.
I missed you man.
Thank God you're back.
I need a break. - We both need a break.
Take me far away, Hardik.
I knew it.
I always had my doubts about you two.
Fuck you!
Hey. Priyanka dumped him.
She left him for some..
What's new in that?
Dude, forget him. Listen.
Do you know what happened
in client meeting today?
What? Who cares?
Did you get eggs?
Hear me out.
They loved my presentation.
They want me to give my
presentation to the MD.
I'm going to Goa for the presentation.
Flight. Hotel. All five star. All free.
Where are you going?
Goa!
Baba's herb."
Baba's herb."
This is bullshit!
Fully bullshit this is!
You had my business class
ticket cancelled..
..and making me drive to Goa.. in my car.
That's the limit.
Now, one of you at least sit in the front.
Shut up, bunny. We'll take turns.
Balls!
Bunny, you're not listening.
Look. Luv is loveless.
Loveless.
I am jobless. - Jobless.
I'm in deep mess.
And you're still concerned
about your useless ticket.
Just watch.
This trip is going to be the
biggest mistake of our life.
Chill, Bunny. Share our joint.
You'll feel happy.
I don't want your bloody..
What the.. I'm burnt..
"The herb is the solution
of every problem."
"It gives strength when
you are frustrated."
Baba's herb."
Baba's herb."
Now we just need a party.
And some action for you.
Remember.
When one girl breaks your heart.
Yeah. Yeah. Another one mends it.
- Correct.
Do you know how to double this effect?
- How?
Look.
I'll show you triple effect.
Hardik.
Hardik.
Shit..
Fucker! My balls are exposed!
Hardik.
Are you okay?
You're not drowning or anything, right?
It's okay. You can stop now.
I saw what I had to.
You saw everything?
I have something for you.
You mind? - Oh yeah, sure.
I am Luv, by the way. - Hi, I am Luna.
Nice to meet you.
I've seen you somewhere.
No, no, I'm not flirting with you.
It sounds like a line, but..
..how would I, in a pool... naked?
I've seen you somewhere. - I know.
Right? See.
Where?
Actually, I'm quite up-to-date about you.

Where's the party?
Is it too far?
Not too far.
10-15 minutes.
20-50 maximum.
We're going on a bloody island!
It's close.
Hardik.
Think we missed the ferry.
Wait, I'll check.
Are we really going on that island?
No one goes there. I won't go.
It's just close-by..
I won't go.
I've a meeting tomorrow It's important.
Let's go, no one goes on that island.
Thank God! Let's go. - But..
We'll drive the boat ourselves. - Yes.
Just a minute.
Does anyone here know how to steer a boat?
- No.
I've to stay alive for tomorrow.
I'm not coming along Hardik.
Bunny, give me your car keys.
Why do you want it?
We've to leave it as collateral.

"The night's a whore. Begs for more."
"So, do it slowly-slowly."

"So, do it slowly-slowly."
"Get the weeds, roll the joint."
"But, do it slowly-slowly."

Five. - Five thousand?
Nice party.
Nice beach.

Sand.
Very romantic.
What are you doing?
I...
I thought we had a moment.
I am sorry. - We didn't have a moment.
We were enjoying the silence. - Yes. I..
I thought there was a connection...
- Look, Luv.
You seem like a really nice guy.
And, you just got out of a relationship.
Maybe this trip's just an
excuse to meet new girls.
Get over your ex. - No. Who does that?
I understand.
I don't want to be one of those girls.
A time pass girl.
- You're not a time pass girl.
You're a very nice girl. I like you.
You are.. - Luv.
I think my friends are waiting for me.
I should go.
Okay. Bye.
What?
See that? - What?
Where were you all night?
Where were you?
Any luck with Scooty? - Luna.
No. I screwed up.
I shouldn't have listened to you.
Where's Bunny? - Bunny.
I couldn't sleep all night
because of those two.
Those two are such lazybones.
I mean... you know, I got them their jobs.
They stay in my house, drive my car.
And this Goa trip, all because of me.
It's okay. They're my friends after all.
I mean, I like to party too.
But, they should be good for something.
Why couldn't I sleep all night?
I'm hungry too.
I had brownies.
I had at least 4-5..
What are you doing?
No, I mean let's brush first...
Your make-up is all..
Let's freshen up first. After that
we can try to do all this. - Bunny.
Bunny.
My friends are calling me. I've to go.
Bunny. - I've to go.
We'll be in touch.
Facebook friends.
Bye.
Bunny.
Where were you guys? - Us?
Where were you?
I've been looking for you two all night.
So, you should've told us.
I can't see anything.
Let's go anywhere, I
think party is over now.
Where has everyone gone?
I can't see anyone.
Yes, where did everyone go?
Did you guys try the new drug?
Hardik, did you try it?
- No. I didn't have money.
Did you try it?
No. - Hey!
Wait. Wait.
What did he say?
I think he's Russian.
No, no, speak in English.
Someone put some damn subtitles.
What's he saying?
There's no network, or I had used translator..
- Wait a minute.
Excuse me.
I no understand what you say.
Who are you?
What is your name?
Name-o!
Run.
Run!
Run! Run!
Hardik.
What are you doing? Get up.
Run!
They slit that Russian's
stomach and ate him.
They ate the Russian, they'll eat us too.
You two are crazy?
Where have you brought me?
Take me away from here right now.
Hardik. Oh, God!
What's happening? Why is it happening?
Hardik. What now?
What will we do? - Quiet.
We should get out of here. - Look..
What's that? - Luna.
That must be Luna.
Last night she said she's staying
somewhere near that cottage.
Cool. We should leave. - Come on.
Hardik.
We should help.
We can't leave her.
Excuse me..
What do you mean?
We'll go there, get Luna
and leave together.
Go there? - Yes.
We shot our pants getting here.
Now, you want to climb a mountain.
We can't leave them alone.
We've to help them.
We don't know if it's Luna or someone else.
We'll have to help whoever
is in the cottage.
That's humanity.
Humanity? - Yes.
Does anyone on this
island look like humans?
I'm going anyway.
What the..
I'm going. - I'm not coming.
I'm going. - I'm not coming.
I'm going.
Should I? - Go.
Always emotionally blackmailing us.
Luv. I'll get you a new Luna (moped).
A better one.
You can ride it everyday.
Why so hung up on her?
Luv. I don't have a good
feeling about this.
I didn't ask for your help.
I can do this alone.
Alone? You'll get screwed by yourself.
Hardik. What's going on?
What is all this?
Actually, I had seen something
similar in a horror flick.
But I can't remember now.
Wait a minute.
I know what they are.
They can't tolerate sunlight.
Their bodies start burning.
Right! This isn't exactly a dark night.
Guess that's just for vampires.
Well. At least we know
they aren't vampires.
Yeah. Because if they were,
he would've surely saved us.
Did you see their feet?
Was it backwards? In mean in reverse.
- Shut up, Bunny.
Those are witches.
Witches have back-facing feet.
And anyway, none of them were
walking backward. Right.
Must be ghosts.
Ghosts that can be seen in the day.
Mutant ghosts.
Cross.
Well show them the cross, they'll run away.
I do have a cross.
But, what if they aren't Catholics.
Yes you are right.
Who is the Russian's God? - Stalin.
I think its something they
ate last night at the party.
They've lost their minds.
I know what they are.
What? Evil-Dead?
They're zombies.
Zombies? But..
We've only ghosts and spirits in India.
Where did zombies come from?
Globalization.
These foreigners are screwing us!
First they brought HIV. And now zombies.
If they bite us, will we turn into them?
Nice theory.
We can't test it.
But how will we escape?
Let's think for a while.
What do we know about zombies?
What do we know, what did we learn.
Okay.
We know nothing, and we've learnt shit.
Yes. - Correct.
All we know is that they are
hungry, and we are their food!
They can't walk fast.
They are slow. - Yeah right.
Yeah and we're world class athletes.
No one.
Let's go. - Come on.
Wait. Come here.
Luna.
Luna. - Luna.
Luna.
Oh God. - Luna.
Luv.
Luv. - What?
Let's leave. - Shut up, Bunny.
Luna.
Who's that?
It's me, Luv.
Are you alright?
I'm so scared.
It's alright. It's okay.
Relax. - Hey, don't be scared.
You're safe.
We're here.
This is Hardik.
And.. -Hi.
That's Bunny. - Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Bunny.
What happened here?
Last night, after we returned,
Sikha became very sick.
I guess.. it was the red pill.
Can you believe it? She bit her!
She was damn scary.
She was outside the door for two hours.
I was so scared.
Then, she heard something
from below and left.
I don't know what happened
to Mariah and Daisy.
I've been hiding here since then.
That must have been scary.
Come let's go.
Yeah, let's go.
Dude. Luna's hot.
I was first. I found her.
No.
Just because you applied first..
..doesn't mean you'll get admission.
Admission is only on merit.
What?
Don't try to act smart.
Come on.
Mariah. - Run.
Oh no!
It's okay.
They're only girls.
Let's fight them.
We can fight them.
Yes, we can fight them.
Okay.
I'll take the hot one.
Luv, you take the pissed-off one.
Bunny, go for the fat one.
Why do I always get the fat one?
I want the hot one. - Shut up.
We are not taking them on a date.
Why are they all coming towards me?
You never respected girls.
So, now they're punishing you.
Its bad karma.
Thank you.
Bunny hit her.
Oh my God! - What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What is this dog behavior?
No, shoo.
Mariah, stop.
What's wrong with you?
I'll hit you..
Shoo. Stop.
Fuck!
Sorry.
Sorry.
I said sorry.
What.. Sorry!
I said sorry.
Let's talk.
Let's talk.
Please.. please.. Don't bite me.
I kill dead people!
Anybody bit? - Which beet? What beat?
What..
Anybody bitten? - Bitten?
No, we're fine.
Take it off.
Take off shirt.
Turn around.
You.
You.
Very good!
Very, very good!
They're safe.
You..
I saw you last night at the rave.
You're Russian Mafia.
Was. Was.
Now, all my men dead.
Only Nikolai and me. - Very sad.
I am Hardik by the way.
Boris.
Luv.
Luna.
Hello.
Sir, I'm Bunny.
Such a pleasure to meet you, sir.
Thank you for saving our lives, sir.
Now, we must be quiet.
Super quiet.
We've to find a way off this island.
There must be a ferry out here.
No ferry.
Two days. This party, 72 hours.
We find another way.
We've a boat. - Yes.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
We've boat. We go in boat.
What? Boat?
This is very good.
Where's boat? - Near rave party.
That way.
Nikolai.
Ask him for a gun, for our safety.
Good idea. - Go, go, go.
Boris. Excuse me.
Excuse me, Boris. - Baris.
Boris.
Baris.
Boris. - Baris.
Sir, do you have an extra
gun that we can use?
We'll feel safer.
Can you shoot? - Of course.
Actually, yes. We're very good shooters.
Call of Duty Champions.
Modern Warfare as well. PS3.
Video games.
These guns, careful.
Bullets, very precious.
No waste.
Till we reach boat, we need bullets.
One bullet, one zombie.
Only shoot..
Hardik, why isn't he dying?
Because he's already dead.
How do we kill them? - I don't know.
Aim at his heart.
No damn effect.
Aim at his balls.
All his parts are inactive.
His balls are dead.
Oh no. No bullets.
Fucker!
He's coming this way.
Fuckers!
Which planet you're from?
How dumb you are.
You don't understand a word I say.
You were saying so many words.
Honestly, we can't understand your accent.
I'll shoot you both now.
But, I don't want to waste bullets.
Thank God. - Sir, with all due respect..
So many.. So many bullets wasted.
On one.. little zombie.
Not even kill zombie.
Okay, it's okay.
At least we know we've to
shoot them in the head.
So, what do we know?
What have we learnt?
What?
Are you really Russian? - What?
You look a little desi.
Are you really Russian?
Fine, I'm from Delhi, mother fucker!
After all those years with the
Russians, blood's turned to Vodka.
I'm light coloured. And I
learnt the accent too.
Had no choice.
He's a local guy..
Mr. Boris. We can't understand the signs.
Two words.
Sounds like.. round about..
Hindi or English?
Bloody fools!
I will not play dumb charades
in the jungle, would I?
Every signal means one thing.
Danger.
So shut the fuck up and hide.
He could've just said that.
Why confuse us?
He must practice every day.
All this is because of D2- RF pill.
Latest. Strong.
Top quality drug.
This rave party was to launch the drug.
Special consignment.
Ordered from the Siberian Border. - Really.
What does this drug exactly do?
It shakes you up.
Coke, ecstasy, MDMA.
They're nothing compared to it.
Hard core addiction.
It gives you ultimate high.
I think it gets you so high, the
body isn't able to tolerate it,
Except for a small part of the
brain, rest of the body dead.
They've turned into walking corpses.
That's why they say "Say no to Drugs".
- Shut up.
So, that small part of their brain..
..controls their entire body? - Correct.
No pain, no pleasure, no emotion.
Only hunger.
Hunger to be high.
These people are hungry to get high.
And I think blood gets them high.
They can't feel pain.
So, even if you shoot their hands
and legs they'll keep coming.
I think there's just one way to stop them.
Blow their brains.
We've already learnt that lesson.
And thank God, at least they're slow.
- Yes.
This is just the beginning.
They can get dangerous as
their hunger increases.
How do you know that?
Baby, I've blown 20- 30
brains since yesterday.
Consider it research.
Boris. Any way to escape them?
I don't know. Maybe not.
You go, get boat.
We go jeep, get diesel.
Sea that way.
Water that way.
Idiots.
How will we know if he
speaks in three languages?
Seat belts do save life.
Our lives.
Are you sure you parked it here?
- Don't ask me.
We were all there.
Where's the boat?
Oh my, God!
Ariana!
You were with her last night?
Ask her to return the boat.
I don't think she'll listen.
Guys, she's in a bad state.
Just last night she was so.. alive.
Come on, Hardik.
You can woo anyone.
Living or zombie.
Don't be silly. - Are you mad?
No, no, it'll be fine.
Go on. - Are you mad?
Go. Go on.
Go on.
Are you serious? - You can do it.
Come on. - Fine.
All the best.
Hi, baby.
Remember me. Last night.
Super fun time.
Hardik. Be polite.
Show her love.
So hot on this boat.
Come inside, take a dip with me.
It's awesome.
Come on. Ariana, come.
Come on. Come, baby.
I'll get you
We got jeep.
We got diesel..
Where's boat?
Hardik's girlfriend took it.
Dead girlfriend.
The zombie who's in that boat
which is drifting that way.
We don't have a boat. What now?
These currents have a pattern.
If she stays in the boat,
she'll drift back this way.
So.. how long?
16- 18 hours.
What the fuck?
How will we survive that
long on this island?
It's getting dark now.
We need a safe place to sleep.
Let's go.
Oh my God.
Let's check it out.
Anything to eat?
Some fruits.
I hate fruits.
No pizza.
Order for it. It'll be here in 30 minutes.
- Funny.
So, what's the plan?
Let's wait here tonight, and leave at dawn.
These bananas no good for me.
Isn't there anything better to eat?
Hey. Tell us about your Russian girlfriend.
I mean, not that it matters now.
But still, just for the info.
She was awesome.
Just a minute.
Are you sure she was fine before you..
Meaning?
I mean, when you were doing her..
..was she doing this.
Are you crazy?
Even I've standards.
But..
Are you infected?
What?
You made sex with zombie.
That was before.
She was fine then. I am fine now.
Yes, I'm fine.
I doubt it.
I can talk, zombies don't.
You're not a zombie, but you
can turn into one later.
That's not done.
On that basis, will you kill me now?
What kind of mafia-ness is this?!
Boris.
I think he's fine.
We can't take a chance.
Everyone's life is in danger.
I want to be 100% sure.
How?
7x2 = 14.
7x3 = 21.
7x4 = 28.
7x5 = 35.
7x6 = 5.. 42!
That's easy.
Everyone knows the tables up to 10.
Let's hear you say tables of 14.
I'm having a bad time with
7, why are you going to 14.
And anyway, I use the calculator..
..on my mobile phone for such things.
That's the problem with
the younger generation.
Why calculator?
Can't you use your brains?
So, you want me to die now.
Let's make it simple.
World capitals.
What is the capital of Uganda?
Your fuck grandmother.
I will drink your blood.
You want to eat him? - No, no.
You want to eat him? - No, no.
I didn't mean it.
I don't really want to drink his blood.
I was only threatening him.
Boris. I think he's fine.
What did you have last night?
Last night I..
I don't remember.
Memory loss. First sign of brain damage.
No, no, Boris.
My brains already that damaged.
Luv, tell him.
Boris, I think he's fine.
I'm such a fun-loving, jolly boy.
Luna, do I look like a dead man to you?
Enough, Boris. He's fine. - Yeah.
We'll see.
Nikolai.
Will I've to tell his blood-group now?
You want to eat Nikolai? - What?
Answer me!
Do you want to eat Nikolai, yes or no?
- No.
But, I want to puke.
Boris. I think he's fine.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
You.. - What?
Uganda?
Curse you..
I was trying to help him.
So you..
Keep an eye on him.
If he changes, we have to finish him.
Once he becomes zombie, no mercy.
Friend, sister, mother, brother.
All the same.
Have to kill.
Okay. We've something
important to take care of.
Stay here.
We'll be back. - Now?
That's insane.
What could be so important
to risk your lives?
It's important for me.
Listen carefully and
remember, and you'll live.
Shut all doors, windows and curtains
All lights off.
Only small lights and candles.
One person keep watch.
Stay together.
At any condition, don't try to be a hero.
I'll be back.
Chill! Chill! Chill!
Oh my, God. You scared me.
I'm sorry.
Look. I couldn't sleep.
So, I thought on checking up on you.
If you want anything?
I can see that you're sorted.
I don't want anything.
I am fine.
Whatever happened last night
on the beach, I am sorry.
It was actually Hardik's idea.
Some stupid philosophy.
There's just one cure for a broken heart.
Sex?
No, not sex.
No one said sex.
What do you think I am?
You're.. you..
- And, you're here to try your luck again.
Where to where you're going?
I came to say sorry.
I am just joking.
Actually, thank you.
If you hadn't come looking
for me, then maybe..
Thank you. - You're welcome.
Okay, go now.
Get some rest.
So, this is not a moment? - No.
Okay.
Goodnight. - Goodnight.
It's just me. - Hardik.
What's your problem?
Why are you two taking turns to scare me?
Was Luv here?
Are you both taking turns..
..to see who gets the girl? - No way.
Luv and me?
Luv's no competition for me.
I can see that.
You know, Luv's got a problem.
He falls for any girl that
talks to him politely.
He's a bit stupid.
You don't have a girlfriend, do you?
Mine?.. No.
All this is not for me.
I'm happier like this.
Wham! Bam! Thank you ma'am!
Something like that.
How many girls have you been with?
Around two-three.. hundred.
So, you never fell in love. - What?
Do I look that type?
You don't.
But you must've fallen in
love with someone, sometime.
Love happens.
But the girls keep changing.
I feel sorry for you.
That bitch.
Not you, her.
We used to chat on the internet.
All night we spoke on the phone.
I loved her so much.
I bought her gifts every day.
Chocolates. Teddy bears.
All the pink stuff.
I wrote a love-letter
for her, with my blood.
I fell unconscious on the third page.
But I completed it.
And what did she give me in return?
That cheat.
She just left me one day.
That bitch..
Since then my reputation is ruined.
They all think that I'm this big..
Sex maniac.
Bloody pervert.
Even you thought I came here to hit on you.
When actually, I was looking for food.
It's okay. It's okay.
I got a little too sentimental.
It never happens.
No harm in talking. - What?
I was so gay. - It's okay. It's okay.
What do you think you're doing?
I thought you..
No?
Guess I misread the signals. - Oh God!
Maybe you.. No? - Just go.
Okay.
You sure? - Just go.
Luv?
Shit.
Bunny.
Luv. - What are you doing?
Bunny. Get up.
Got him. Got him.
Got him.
What's the idea? - I don't know.
Then this is a very bad idea.
Why did you jump on him?
Pull the blanket off!
- Are you crazy?! He'll bite!
Bunny. Get up.
What the hell are you doing?
Kill him.
Try again.
What are you doing?
Looks easier in movies.
- You don't know a thing.
Watch this.
Very good. Good aim.
What are you going to do with this?
- Don't know.
Is he dead?
Is he dead?
Don't know.
Check.
You do it.
Let's check together.
He's angrier now.
Good shot.
What happened here?
Where did he come from? - Don't know.
Maybe he lives here.
It's not safe here.
We should get out.
Where do you expect to go
in the middle of the night?
Stay here. This is safe.
How is this safe?
Didn't he come in. - But, he's dead.
You tried three times..
..and your knife still didn't hit him!
You didn't get him with the torch either.
At least he fell down. - Guys.
I hear something.
Let's run away..
Shut the fuck up man.
Run from the backdoor.
Run. Run.
Just wait.
Let's check first. Okay.
The path's clear.
I think we are safe.
No... zombies!
Close the door.
This way. Come on.
We've to get out of here. - Yes, but how?
Oh my, God. We're so dead.
I shouldn't have come
here in the first place.
Mom always said, Hardik and Luv will..
What the.. Shut up!
Just think what to do.
Okay.
Zombies.
What do we know?
What have we learnt?
That they are zombies. - Yes.
And they want to eat us. - Correct.
But they walk slowly.
And.. they're dumb.
They've nothing up here.
They can't open doors, climb trees..
Can't play Cricket, have babies.
What's the idea?
The idea is.. we pretend to be them.
We'll act like zombies, and they'll
believe we're like them only.
That's your idea? - Rubbish.
It's simple.
Walk slow, walk crooked.
And you'll look like them.
He's crazy.
I saw it in a movie. Okay?
Did it work in the movie?
Don't remember.
Very good.
Hardik.
Hardik, let's get out of here..
- Just a second.
Luv, actually your idea's the best idea.
I suggest.. you go. - Yes.
No, no, no. It's a bad idea.
Very bad idea.
Weren't you pushing me last time?
Look, it's your idea, so you go.
And, if it works, we'll follow.
- That's fair.
Come on. - Okay.
Don't think anything.
You can do this.
You can do this, Luv.
Go on. - Come on, Luv.
All the best.
Priyanka!
Fucker!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Oh no..
Go! Go! Go! Go!
This way! This way!
That was a great idea.
Bloody Einstein, chickens
can also walk on two legs.
But they don't become human.
What?
These things recognize their food..
..and right now we are the chicken!
Guys, we should keep walking. - Yes.
Can't see a thing. I'm scared.
Keep walking.
It'll be morning soon. We just have to
reach the boat. We'll be safe there.
And Boris? Will he
directly come to the boat?
Forget Boris. He's gone
to do his important work.
"Drops. Waves. The morning rays."
"The lazy night that sleeps all day."
"Fireflies. Stars. Sweet and sour."
"The gifts of time."
"The eyes of the heart."
"As I opened them, I realized."
"These views are so beautiful."
"To my buddies."
"To the grace I was blessed with."
"I welcome them from my heart."
Dear God!
Are you still here? - Hardik. Hardik.
Okay. Please, please, please. Save me.
Luv, Bunny and Luna. Actually,
save all of us, please.
I'll forsake all bad habits.
I'll stop flirting with
girls, no drinking..
..no drugs. No porn.
I'll watch a little porn. Can't lie to you.
I will answer my mother's calls.
And I'll get back to you
with a proper list.
But, I've to go now. Jai Hind!
"To my buddies."
"To the grace I was blessed with."
"I welcome you with my heart."
Hardik. Listen.
Sorry.
We should've never doubted
you turned into a zombie.
Don't bring that up again, Bunny.
Topic over.
Don't worry.
I'll be the first one to die amongst us.
- Very good.
What philosophy is that?
You two are the heroes.
Luna's the heroine.
That leaves me.
Hero's friend.
As long as my comedy's working, it's fine.
Once that's dead, so am I.
That's what normally happens
in such a situation.
Just watch.
Those rascals will first
attack the hero's friend.
Bunny, do you seriously
think in so much detail?
Just watch, I will die first.
Why are you so obsessed about dying?
Go die. I won't stop you.
I have to go pee.
Not today. Die another day!
Come on.
Looks safe.
Let's go.
Are you sure? - Yeah.
Do we have to go this way?
Yes, or else we'll have to circle around.
And no one knows the way.
And we can't miss the boat.
Come on, Bunny, let's go.
I'm very hungry. Very hungry.
Wait it out. Let's get out of here first.
I'm hungry too. - Bunch of school kids.
Let's check the tents.
Bunny, you check this one. - Yes.
I'll check those.
Guys, we're supposed to
stay together, right.
Where's the food.. must be in here.
Did you find anything?
Bunny. Found anything to eat?
Say something. - Zombie! Zombie!
What? - Zombie! Zombie!
If we stay here, we'll be food.
What? Really?
Oh God!
One second.
Oh no!
What now?
- We walked right into their mouths!
Run! Run!
This way. Come on.
Where's Bunny?
Bunny! - Bunny!
Bunny! - Bunny!
Bunny! - Let's go.
Let's go.
Hardik! - Luv.
We should do something.
We'll have to distract them.
Yeah, me too.
Hey!
Hey! - Draw their attention!
Zombies!
Hey!
Look.
Come here.
Come on.
Come on.
Hardik!
Come on.
Hardik!
Hardik.
Run! Run!
Run! Run!
Boris!
Guys! Hurry up!
Move to the car, quick.
Nikolai. Start the car.
Oh my God! Boris!
Bunny!
Boris.
Nikolai is..
The boat must be coming back.
Any minute now.
Some coke?
You'll feel good.
No, thank you. No drugs for me.
I want to feel it.
Okay.
God. What the..
What's this?
Not right.
You went back for these, right.
Leaving us to die.
Do you know what this is worth?
Not more than life.
No.
No, no, no.
All of you came here on your own.
You had booze, got high, had
fun, and did it willingly.
And now, when the situation changed..
..I'm responsible for your life?
This is your fault.
You brought those new drugs
and people started dying.
Don't start again.
If it wasn't for me..
..you would've been chewing on each other.
And I also saved your..
..saved your lives, right?
I saved your little ass, didn't I?
So take it easy, baby.
He was ready for the presentation.
I dragged him here.
He would've been stuck in
that useless presentation.
At least he escaped that
boring presentation.
Phone?
You've signal.
Bunny. Hello.
Hello, Hardik.
Hardik, where are you?
Are you alive?
Of course I'm alive.
Why else would I call you? - Yes!
Come soon, save me. - Thank God!
Come quickly or they'll kill me.
Where are you?
What do you mean "Where are we"?
We're coming to get you.
Where are you?
I.. I.. I'm on top of the tower.
Hello.
Hello. - Bunny!
Hello. Hardik! Hardik! Hardik! Hello!
Oh no.
Bunny.
He's alive. He's at the rave party.
I'll go get him.
I got him here.
I will go save him now.
Sorry, God! I abused you in a fit of rage.
- Hardik.
Thank you.
You aren't alone. I'm coming along too.
- Let's go.
You're coming, right?
Do I have a bloody choice?
Without me you'll be mincemeat!
Oh no.
Oh no.
Let's kill dead people!
Hardik!
Mr. Boris! Here!
Hardik! Get Bunny. We cover you.
How many of them are there? - 1399.
How do you know?
It was my party.
These are my guests.
Hardik. Come quickly.
Hardik.
Hardik. Hardik.
You're alive.
I thought you're calling from heaven.
Bunny is safe. We got Bunny.
Hardik, I love you.
I love you. - I love you too.
But, how are you alive?
- It's a long story.
I see..
What to do? - Bunny. Bunny. Bunny.
I think we'll have to jump.
Are you crazy? - Or they'll eat us.
Are you crazy? - Bunny, listen to me.
Fuck..
You guys, that way.
Oh no!
Back up! Back up!
What now?
Keep shooting.
- I've got no bullets, Boris.
Here, take this. - No.
Go. I cover you.
Are you sure? - They will kill you.
Get out of here, quick.
Take it.
Go. - Thank you.
Fast. Hurry up.
Come and get me.
Bunny. - Luv.
Bunny. - Luv.
You're alive.
Just you two? Where's Boris?
Boris is still stuck back there.
There are too many zombies.
Oh, God! - How did you escape?
You won't believe it. It's a long story.
What the..
At least tell us now. - Okay.
It happened like this. Once
I separated from you..
'Get out. Get out. - Listen.'
'Get out.'
'Go away.. - Listen, please.'
'Go away. Go. Go away.'
'Go.'
'Oh no.'
No. No.
'Bunny.'
Let's go.
'No, no, no.'
Go back.
You always said, mixing two
drugs gives side-effects.
I think, it's happening
with the zombies as well.
The coke stopped them in their tracks.
And I escaped.
Coke!
Boris.
Shoot this.
What you doing? - Oh no.
That's 10,000 dollars, asshole.
Just shoot it.
Throw more, its working.
It's working. It's working.
He is safe.
Nikolai.
Boris, shoot him.
Sorry my old friend.
Goodbye.
Quickly. Boris.
Please don't shoot. - What?
She's only a zombie.
She maybe a zombie now.
But she was a babe until yesterday.
Allow me.
Ariana.
Ariana. Baby.
Baby.
Go, go, go. - Quickly.
Run, run.
Let's go. Let's go.
Bye, Ariana.
I will miss you.
What do you think? What does all this mean?
As in?
What do we know? What have we learnt?
Drugs can Fuck you up.
That's what I learnt.
They can turn you into a zombie.
You should always respect women.
You never know who might try to bite you.
I am serious.
Karma is bitch, my friends!
Finally, Goa!
We are safe!
Oh no..
Dude!
