<span style="style.default_1">Seeing them now you wouldn't guess</span>
<span style="style.default_1">their sex life was once quite active.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I know it's wrong to talk about</span>
<span style="style.default_1">your parents' sex life.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But the argument about right and wrong</span>
<span style="style.default_1">started ages ago.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I feel guilty for one thing.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I was the reason they argued.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Nineteen years ago after marriage</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and two kids,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">their sex life was both active</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and complicated.</span>
Niren!
Niren!
Niren, wake up!
Let me sleep, Aditi. It's Sunday.
Sleep later. I'm so tense right now.
Get up...
Now I'm half awake, thanks.
Let me be, please!
Niren, just look!
I'm pregnant.
How's that possible?
I told you, "Don't be too smart.
Use a condom."
How's this my fault now?
We planned it together.
You said the rhythm method
was scientifically proven.
So you expect me to pop a pill every day?
Even if it makes me dizzy?
How convenient.
You enjoy your oats every morning
while Aditi pops pills.
<span style="style.default_1">What's this racket?</span>
Think of the neighbors.
Nothing, Papa. Sorry.
-Mamma!
-Ishaan is up.
Ishlu, good morning.
<span style="style.default_1">On one side, North Delhi's</span>
<span style="style.default_1">karate champion, Niren Chaudhary.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I called him Panda. Kung Fu Panda.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">On the other, the "almost" Miss India</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from South Delhi,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">my Mummy, Aditi Chaudhary.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">This tyke is my elder brother,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Ishaan Chaudhary.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I call him Giraffe.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The poor boy has no idea about</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the hot water his parents are in.</span>
Mom, Ishaan is up.
Please serve him breakfast.
You too come now.
The breakfast is getting cold.
<span style="style.default_1">She was a tigress, but I called her Moose.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Not the chocolate mousse,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but a soft-hearted animal.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Google it later.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Moose was a Hindu.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Only until two years of marriage.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then she had a vision and got converted</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to Christianity.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Like a true Hindu,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Panda did not object to her conversion.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But he didn't realize</span>
<span style="style.default_1">that in her reading of the Bible,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">abortion was a sin.</span>
Aditi, we can't risk it again.
Sorry. An abortion is the only option.
What are you saying?
You know I can't do that.
Keep it low, Papa will overhear.
We have Ishaan.
We were lucky to have him.
We don't want any more kids.
We didn't plan this, right?
I know there's a special reason
this child is coming.
Stop! I don't believe in all that.
It's in our hands.
It's your body, so it's your decision.
-What if--
-It's a girl?
What if she's like Tanya?
I don't have the courage, Aditi.
Don't you feel incomplete without Tanya?
<span style="style.default_1">Call her a tigress or a Bible follower,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Moose always gets her way.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Moose was an ace emotional blackmailer.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Poor Panda!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Panda was like Moose's little poodle.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Cute!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Here I am! Their third harvest!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I shouldn't be praising myself</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but, what a beauty!</span>
Don't be scared. Have faith in God.
He won't make you suffer again.
We're calling her Aisha.
Aisha means life.
Wow! Perfect name.
Take it from me.
She'll live a hundred years.
You're right, Papa.
Why are you all morose?
Your granddaughter is here.
Smile!
It's not like I flunked in Math again.
Let's celebrate! Sweets for everyone.
You first.
-Yeah, there's my effort too.
-Yeah, of course.
She was destined to come home.
Let's take a picture.
-Okay, everyone let's say Aishi.
-Aishi...
<span style="style.default_1">Grandpa had overreacted slightly.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">If I could make it,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">could I tell you this story?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">By the way, my life has ended</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but their story hasn't.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Just because I'm dead,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">it doesn't mean the story lacks suspense.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Before I move on, I have a request.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Please don't imagine me as some ghost.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I still have killer looks,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but not the scary one.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Forget about me.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Listen to their story.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">They didn't have the money</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to honeymoon in Nepal,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but thanks to me, they got to see London.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">London, bro, London!</span>
The absence of tonsils
and your family history
lead me to conclude
that the Indian doctors were right.
I can't guarantee anything.
But there's a treatment for Aisha.
The best match is a sibling.
We have a son, Ishaan.
Here. This is his blood report.
We'll test you both too.
Of course.
With a deficient immune system,
she is prone to infections.
Keep her isolated as much as you can.
The treatment's very expensive.
It could go up to 120,000 pounds.
I have some savings.
Nonsense.
You've already done so much for us.
Hardly! Why are you being so formal?
The bedroom is yours.
No. We're fine here.
<span style="style.default_1">I'm so sorry I'm here without any notice.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">We were in such a hurry...</span>
Even if your dad has to beg,
he won't give up.
It'll take time. But we aren't leaving
until you recover.
Until then stay with me, okay?
<span style="style.default_1">If it wasn't for me,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">we wouldn't have come to London.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Panda made the rounds of London</span>
<span style="style.default_1">with his lunch box every day.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">He'd put up posters in shops</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and leave appeals for businessmen.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It was tough enough</span>
<span style="style.default_1">paying for the flight here.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Now we had to find the price of a trip</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to the moon!</span>
Niren Chaudhary. Sorry, I'm late.
I had to take a train.
Relax! You're not at the BBC.
You may not get big donations.
Even if you get 20,000 pounds,
consider yourself lucky.
Raise your hopes too high
and you'll be disappointed.
And keep it brief.
This is a music program after all.
<span style="style.default_1">This is your host and friend, Arjun Gill,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from Sunrise Radio.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Friends, today I want you to hear</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a heartfelt plea.</span>
This year on the 27th of March,
Aisha Chaudhary was born with SCID.
Today we have her father,
Niren Chaudhary, with us in the studio.
Niren, what does SCID mean?
Severe Combined Immune Deficiency.
A rare genetic disorder. A baby is born
with a deficient immune system.
It's impossible to fight infections
with this condition.
Within a year of their birth,
such children...
I mean if they do not get the treatment...
they won't survive.
Our first born, Tanya,
suffered from the same deficiency.
She did not survive.
No, sir. It's okay.
What causes SCID?
My wife, Aditi, and I have a rare gene.
It's a faulty gene.
There's a 25% chance
our children will inherit this gene.
One in a million couples have this gene.
We happen to be that couple.
The doctors say if she doesn't have
a bone marrow transplant in two weeks...
our Aisha won't survive.
Aisha's parents have
managed to collect 60,000 pounds
including their life savings.
But they need a whopping 120,000 pounds
in total.
How will they find this amount
to save their Aisha?
Who will help the Chaudhary family?
Who amongst us?
Please help us.
Remember Sheetal Agarwal?
Malvika said she's divorced.
She was nuts about you in college.
Marry her.
Divorce her once you've got
the 120,000 pounds.
That's the cost I'll have to pay
to a divorce lawyer.
I'll get you married to Singhania,
the fat owner of Ramjas College.
He must still be single.
Aisha and Ishaan will stay with me.
-You can see them on weekends.
-Stop it!
I'm sure he'd go on a diet for you.
What do we tell Ishaan?
That his sister has become
a star in the sky?
I should move to my mother's.
Before you and Ishaan get
too attached to her--
No one's going anywhere.
Focus on one thing at a time.
Come on. Goodnight.
Aditi, the doctor's on the line.
Just hold her.
Mrs. Chaudhary...
<span style="style.default_1">the report is a little odd.</span>
-I'd rather not discuss it on the phone.
-You can tell me.
<span style="style.default_1">Niren is not Ishaan's father.</span>
What?
What do you mean "what?"
Obviously, it's a mistake, Niren.
Who else could be Ishaan's father?
We'll have to repeat the tests.
Thank God Anshu is bringing Ishaan here.
He'll be a 100 percent match.
Now even his life is getting disturbed.
If kids don't do well in primary school,
passing the ICSE exam is impossible.
I know. ICSE exams aren't easy.
Who's giving the ICSE test?
Ishaan. When he grows up.
What are you talking about?
I'm suing that hospital.
Converting rupees into pounds
has wiped me out.
What about Ishaan's airfare?
Tell me.
It's nothing, baby. It's a small prick.
Like the tip of a pencil.
Look at Mamma.
Aishi will say,
"My brother Ishaan is so brave.
He didn't even cry."
That's what Aishi will say. Right?
It'll feel like an ant bite.
Sorry, Mamma. Sorry, Dadda.
Ishlu...
You're my brave boy!
Kids from North Delhi don't cry.
-Who don't cry?
-Kids from North Delhi.
-What was that about?
-Let's not create a scene.
What scene? No one knows us here.
-Talk in Hindi. Who'll understand?
-Please stop it, Aditi.
What if someone told you
everything you believed was a lie?
How would you feel? Acting so cool.
Don't beat around the bush!
Out with it.
I'm not stupid. I know why Ishaan is okay.
Because he's not my son.
It's obvious.
Tanya and Aisha got SCID from me.
So, it's my fault?
I cheated on you?
Take your suspicious, narrow mind
back to North Delhi.
I had no idea your brain
was still stuck on that note!
-Must I prove my chastity next?
-There's such a thing as science.
Fine! Then sit here and use your science
to judge my character.
If it wasn't for Aisha,
Ishaan would not have been retested.
I've nothing to prove to you,
or to anyone. Go to hell!
<span style="style.default_1">They needed money for one kid</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and proof for the other.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Amidst the crisis,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the one having a blast was Giraffe.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Oblivious to the fact that he may not be</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a Chaudhary after all.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But Uncle Anshu knew.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And yet he gorged.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">London, bro!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I did tell you that their sex life was</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a little complicated.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">At least the doctors guaranteed</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I was a Chaudhary.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Or else they would've gone home</span>
<span style="style.default_1">being single.</span>
Sir! Can you do me a favor?
Taxis can't park here.
Sure.
There's a baby named Aisha Chaudhary
in the hospital.
Please give this to her father.
-Any news on the money?
-We're trying hard.
We have Ishaan and your blood reports.
There was some mix-up
at the Indian hospital, apparently.
I'm sure you knew that already.
You are indeed Ishaan's father!
So the reports are in?
I knew it. I always did.
There was no need for a retest.
I told Aditi it was a waste of money
but she never listens.
You know her.
Quick to judge, easy to apologize!
You're right to be angry.
I behaved stupidly.
But you're not stupid.
Forgive me now.
<span style="style.default_1">I am sorry.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I am sorry.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Please forgive me.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I am sorry.</span>
Sorry.
-How did you find this in London?
-Love has its ways.
Arjun Gill.
<span style="style.default_1">Niren, turn on the radio.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Stay on the line.</span>
-The radio...
-Turn on the radio.
<span style="style.default_1">Beloved friends in London,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">this is Arjun Gill from Sunrise Radio.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">We're far from our homeland</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but close to the heart.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Thanks for the donations and prayers</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from your hearts.</span>
We have received 250,000 pounds
for baby Aisha Chaudhary!
Oh, good God!
<span style="style.default_1">You've donated double the money</span>
<span style="style.default_1">they needed. You have made me proud.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Aisha's father, Niren Chaudhary,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">is on the line.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Niren, I'd like you to know that</span>
Indian and British listeners
have given generously,
but also people from Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Nepal, Afghanistan
and many other immigrants
have also contributed.
<span style="style.default_1">Would you like to say something?</span>
I'd like to tell them...
You people have treated my daughter
as your own.
I could not have saved her on my own.
Now I'm sure she'll live a long life.
Aisha's mother and I want...
to give you our heartfelt thanks.
Thank you, Arjun.
<span style="style.default_1">Thank you, Niren.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Goodbye and good luck.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Imagine a room filled with pounds</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from floor to the ceiling.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Two pounds, five pounds and some checks.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Some even sent their piggy banks.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Such people exist!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I couldn't say it then,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">so I'll say it now...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Thank you, Sunrise Radio.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And thank you, London.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Ishaan and Uncle Anshu's ice-cream party</span>
<span style="style.default_1">was over.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Ishaan turned out to be a Chaudhary.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But his bone marrow didn't match mine.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">This task too was in Panda's fate.</span>
Aisha may join your sister, Taanu,
in heaven.
<span style="style.default_1">Anyone else might've hidden this news</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from a 4-year-old ice-cream loving kid.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But Moose never hid anything</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from her children.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Why would she?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My name had been entered</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in the medical annals of Europe.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I was the first SCID patient to be given</span>
<span style="style.default_1">both a bone marrow</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and stem cell transplant.</span>
-Sorry.
-Thank God you're here.
Hold her.
I hope they haven't taken him in yet.
Take care of her.
She's crying a lot today.
<span style="style.default_1">It wasn't easy for Panda</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to go through the surgery alone.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But you need practice to run</span>
<span style="style.default_1">between two hospitals.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">If you compare Moose with Milkha Singh,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the sprinter, that's not fair.</span>
Who knows how long will it take
for her new cells to grow.
I should be here with you both.
You just watch, Aditi.
One day I'll make so much money,
we don't have to worry about anything.
Once Aisha gets well,
we'll rob a bank together.
Until then you'll have to be
Ishaan's mamma too.
I hope the chemotherapy
has no side effects.
Bye, Tootsie.
Hello. How are you, Mom?
I'm fine, dear.
How's Aisha?
<span style="style.default_1">Aisha's fine.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Has Niren left?</span>
Yes, he just left.
Are you all right?
<span style="style.default_1">Yes.</span>
Is Ishaan still up?
As though he ever sleeps!
Ishaan!
-<span style="style.default_1">Mamma!</span>
-Hi, sweetie.
Miss Dipti scolded me
and made me stand in the corner.
Why?
Because I colored the sky pink
in art class.
<span style="style.default_1">Mamma, isn't the color of the sky pink?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Miss Dipti is absolutely wrong.</span>
You can paint the sky any color you want.
Always follow your dreams.
My friends called me a fool.
They said the sky is blue.
Stop crying and listen to your Mamma.
Okay?
<span style="style.default_1">Miss Dipti...</span>
There's no need to change the color
of your sky for anyone. Ever.
<span style="style.default_1">Okay?</span>
Everyone has their own sky.
Understand?
I painted my sky the color I wanted.
If you believe your sky is pink,
then it's pink.
That's it.
Guess what I sent for you with Dadda?
Train!
Mamma loves you, Ishlu...
and your pink sky.
Bye, Mamma.
Bye, son.
<span style="style.default_1">I always thought Moose loved Giraffe</span>
<span style="style.default_1">more than me.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Giraffe believed the opposite.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Honestly, I was more eligible</span>
<span style="style.default_1">for a full-time care.</span>
Here comes the big plane.
And who's flying in it?
And the plane flies like...
<span style="style.default_1">Hospital psychiatrist recommended Moose</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to send home videos of our lives.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">That was the start</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of my first modeling gig.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">We came to London for my treatment.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But Moose ended up being the patient.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Head, shoulder, knees and toes.</span>
What's this?
-Shoulder.
-That's your shoulder?
I'm going to show you our London home.
My tiny cupboard, Aishi's pram.
We must keep it covered
so no germs or bacteria get through.
Our weekly planner.
On these days we go to the hospital...
<span style="style.default_1">If Moose hadn't made these videos,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">she would've sunk into depression.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I was taking the injections</span>
<span style="style.default_1">while Moose missed Giraffe.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Not that Giraffe was dying to watch me!</span>
Aishi! Look, the plane
has landed from Delhi...
Wow! She's started to walk.
<span style="style.default_1">Niren, see that?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">After eight years of marriage,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">this was their first time apart.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Moose was counting the days.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Cuteness has its limits.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And babies are a mess.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But my Moose never gave up.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">She had no option.</span>
Come, baby.
<span style="style.default_1">Hi. Where are you?</span>
Buying stuff for the house.
It's freezing here.
My hands are frozen.
What are you doing? Has Ishaan eaten?
Give him the phone.
He's at your Mom's.
-How come?
-<span style="style.default_1">My parents are in Jammu.</span>
So I made lunch plans.
Who's coming over?
Sonia, Ishaan's--
<span style="style.default_1">Who's this Sonia?</span>
Sir.
Put it upstairs.
We met a few times at Ishaan's school.
<span style="style.default_1">She's going through a divorce</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and wanted some advice.</span>
Hang on! What do you know about divorce?
<span style="style.default_1">Either she's fooling you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">or you're fooling me.</span>
Why solve her problems?
<span style="style.default_1">Are you some expert on divorce?</span>
Are you blind?
Can't you see what this is about?
<span style="style.default_1">Cozying up to a single dad.</span>
Aditi, telling you anything is dangerous.
How am I a single dad?
She should know her rights.
We're just discussing that.
Are you a divorce lawyer now?
<span style="style.default_1">A social worker?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">What's she paying you?</span>
Actually, what are you wearing?
What are you wearing?
A shirt and jeans.
What do you expect?
Which shirt?
The purple one.
Oh! Your cool shirt?
So, you want to impress her
with your dude shirt?
Niren, if you wear that shirt--
I'm not changing.
Nonsense!
<span style="style.default_1">I doubted you.</span>
I was wrong.
Are you taking revenge now?
-Come on, Aditi. Rise above it.
-Rise above it?
Should I rise above the world too?
-Your guest has arrived.
-I'm off. She's here.
<span style="style.default_1">Don't you dare hang up!</span>
-Hi, Sonia.
-"Hi, Sonia!"
Tell her your mother's ill
and you have to see her. Now!
I'll call tomorrow. I'm hanging up.
<span style="style.default_1">Sheela, Sushma, Mamta.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">None of these names would've</span>
<span style="style.default_1">stirred Moose's suspicions.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But Sonia!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">There's so much oomph in that name,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">even the Prime Minister gets shaken.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Before they got married, Panda was ready</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to crawl through the phone line</span>
<span style="style.default_1">into Moose's arms.</span>
Let's get married.
How much longer must I kiss
this damn phone goodnight?
How many people in your neighborhood
must I seek permission to marry?
<span style="style.default_1">Uncle, Aunty, Papa...</span>
the milkman, the newspaper man,
the baker...
Don't flaunt your upper class
South Delhi attitude.
You used to once like my family values.
<span style="style.default_1">And now they are anathema to you!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Listen...</span>
Why don't you talk to your family?
I'm not afraid of anyone.
I could come over and even talk
to your parents.
You're dangerous. In a sexy way.
-Sexy?
-Chaudhary!
Papa! You?
What's up? Can't you sleep?
I'm sending her father our phone bill.
Go to sleep!
Something wrong with you boys.
<span style="style.default_1">Grandpa was worried about the phone bill.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">There were many places in Delhi</span>
<span style="style.default_1">for romancing. Lodhi Gardens,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Hauz Khas Lake, Majnu's Tila,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but at night none were open.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">That night Panda was deprived of</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Moose's goodnight kisses.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Panda was scared of Grandpa...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but not as much as of Moose!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">No girl had entered the Chaudhary home</span>
<span style="style.default_1">before marriage.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And Moose loved a challenge. So...</span>
Put your helmet down.
<span style="style.default_1">The only thought in Panda's head</span>
<span style="style.default_1">was the bedroom.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">He didn't know Moose had planned to see</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the whole house.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">These lanes</span>
<span style="style.default_1">These alleys</span>
<span style="style.default_1">These lanes</span>
<span style="style.default_1">These alleys</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Longer than hope</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Deeper than faith</span>
<span style="style.default_1">These winding lanes</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Intriguing are the paths of the heart</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>
<span style="style.default_1">O heart</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Why impose conditions?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">O heart</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Why stir feelings?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Why make me cry?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>
My great-grandma used to make
chili pickle here.
Looks like it's my turn!
Shall I crush you into a pickle?
-You're so cheap!
-That's true.
-Technique matters, you know.
-Technique's nothing.
-I could father a cricket team in one go.
-Really? Isn't the stadium a bit small?
So I need less of a run up!
Gutsy, eh?
Let's stop hiding then.
<span style="style.default_1">I feel a little apprehension</span>
<span style="style.default_1">As I make my way through</span>
<span style="style.default_1">This old house alone, fearful</span>
<span style="style.default_1">What is there to fear?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I'm right here</span>
<span style="style.default_1">There are new hearts</span>
<span style="style.default_1">In this old house</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I want to fly a kite from every terrace</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart wants to soar in the sky</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Free, without judgment</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I didn't watch my first Bollywood film,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I heard it.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">When Moose went to watch</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Shah Rukh Khan in "DDLJ."</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Our family tradition was to sing hymns</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to a fetus.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Instead I heard the famous line,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">"Go, Simran! Go, live your life."</span>
<span style="style.default_1">If you have a lovely dream</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Make sure to share it with me</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You fill my eyes</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Let me sleep in your arms</span>
Niren, how are you?
Fixing the antenna.
A lot more needs fixing here!
My mother misses you.
Come over.
I miss her too!
<span style="style.default_1">My heart is spinning</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It never stops</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It can't hear, does not listen</span>
<span style="style.default_1">To a single word I say</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>
<span style="style.default_1">When people marry out of caste,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the society judges them.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">People would tell Grandpa that</span>
<span style="style.default_1">my SCID was caused by their love marriage.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Now what has SCID got to do with it?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But Sonia...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The name had so much oomph that Moose</span>
<span style="style.default_1">stopped picking up Panda's calls.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Moose knew exactly how to extract</span>
<span style="style.default_1">an apology.</span>
Look who's here!
Aishi, how are you?
I've been calling you for five days.
Why didn't you pick up?
I didn't hear it ring. Try again.
Haven't slept for days.
I can't share you.
You must solve only my problems. Okay?
Besides you...
who would I want to impress?
This long-distance relationship
isn't working, Aditi.
So I've got a transfer.
-Really?
-Yes.
Ishaan and your mother are arriving
in two days.
I talked to his teacher and said
we'd be away for six months.
And not to give his seat to anyone.
Remember we queued up at 5 a.m.
for his admission?
Careful, your mother has sent parathas
and pickle for you.
-Not six months, Niren.
-Six or eight. We'll see.
We can take a buffer of
a couple of months.
Ten years.
Are you kidding?
It'll take time for the T cells
to grow in her body.
And until they do, her body is a war zone.
Even going to the airport could be
life-threatening. She could collapse.
For us, it's just ten years, Niren.
For her, it's her entire life.
<span style="style.default_1">O life!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You played a game of heads and tails</span>
Come, Ishlu, bath time.
Mamma has to go to work.
<span style="style.default_1">O life!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You played a game of heads and tails</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Sometimes the nights are full</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Other times the days are empty</span>
It'll only take five minutes.
Aisha's crying too.
Let me bathe you quickly.
Dadda's just coming.
-Hello!
-Dadda!
What took you so long?
You know it's hard alone.
I wasn't partying.
It's okay, baby.
Tootsie...
Imagine if we had a cricket team!
Go to Dadda.
<span style="style.default_1">O life, every day you give us</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Sustenance to live</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You count all the breaths</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You give us to breathe</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It feels so empty</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Even when you're in a crowd</span>
How did you get hurt?
John pushed me at school.
-Why did John push you?
-He called me a Paki.
<span style="style.default_1">Sometimes you soothe us</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Other times you scare us</span>
And then he slipped into a dream...
<span style="style.default_1">Sometimes you soothe us</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Other times you scare us</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You keep the lamp of hope burning</span>
<span style="style.default_1">For so long have we endured</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The pain you inflicted</span>
<span style="style.default_1">O life!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You played a game of heads and tails</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Sometimes the nights are full</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Other times the days are empty</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You played a game of heads and tails</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Hearing my high-pitched cries you'd think</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I was the main cause of their woes.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And Giraffe was the good child.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But what I can confirm is the smartest</span>
<span style="style.default_1">family member was Moose.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">She had backed the right horse.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It took 13 years, but Panda minted money.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Without robbing a bank!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Moose, the Moosical!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Moosical was absolutely clear.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">When life hands you lemons,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">you make lemonade!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But we differed in our tastes.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The main villain of this story.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The doctors told them to keep me away</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from crowds.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So Moose moved us to a London suburb.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Too much, right?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Would a germ dare take on Moose?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But Moose had decided so.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">"Chaudhary family, about turn!"</span>
<span style="style.default_1">When people visit London,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">they go to Buckingham Palace,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">London Eye, Big Ben.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But me? I was more partial</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to Great Ormond Street Hospital.</span>
Aishi.
They are here. I'll have her call you.
Aisha, please, the dog could give you
an infection. Get off!
Can't you two see?
What's the big deal?
Anyway her allergy level is 3/10.
It won't kill me.
Okay. Let's go inside.
We'll check your blood reports first.
What good will that do?
I'm either lacking in T cells or B cells.
I'm done with this immunity program.
-To hell with the blood reports.
-Aishi!
Come.
Come. It's okay.
<span style="style.default_1">Every six months, I'd show up</span>
<span style="style.default_1">at the hospital...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to consult my horoscope.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Even 13 years later,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">our lives were running in slow motion.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Everyone would try acting casual...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but as we entered the hospital,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">we were holding our breath.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The exam was mine,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but the tension of failure was theirs.</span>
They've lost it.
You too!
Can you imagine?
I can't believe it.
Aisha's absolutely fine.
Her test results are good.
She'll have a life like you and I do.
-Pinch me!
-Once you...
Once you fix your mind on something,
it's done.
I didn't do it alone. We did it.
Are you done?
-I've been promoted.
-What?
We must move back to India.
Country Head.
-But how can we move now?
-It's a huge offer.
Aisha's tests are normal.
For how long will we stay here?
I've talked to my boss.
Are you asking me? Or telling me?
Not asking or telling.
We're discussing it.
The past 13 years have been difficult
in terms of career.
And it's no fun here.
I know.
-But if we have to come back...
-Then we will.
No one's seizing our passports.
<span style="style.default_1">Poor Moose. Just when she could've</span>
<span style="style.default_1">had a normal life in London...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Panda said we were going home.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">In London it was the burbs.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Now it's the back of beyond in Delhi!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">We had a private swimming pool,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but give me the city any day.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I felt I was like Mowgli!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But the highlight for me was</span>
<span style="style.default_1">not being home-schooled anymore.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I felt I was entering the sequel</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of my life through these gates.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">In the name of learning Hindi,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I binged on Bollywood movies.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It was show time!</span>
-Aaa...
-Aamir Khan!
"Babes, talented kids like you..."
"are like bubbles in a soda bottle."
"You rise one by one."
As Kareena said,
"If you're gawking at me instead
of working, it's not my problem!"
Gym class today!
Half of you go this way,
the other half that way.
You ought to be on a talent show.
Do you ever study? Or is this it?
I'm the school's entertainment show.
Karan.
Aisha.
Okay, Aisha, see you later.
<span style="style.default_1">That was the first time</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I noticed Karan's eyebrows.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I was a good student but I became</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a better one when I met Karan.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I wanted to study Karan's history,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Karan's geography... every inch of him.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Fun fact... I didn't wash my hands after</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I shook hands with him.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">All thanks to "rajma-chawal</span>"...
<span style="style.default_1">the CEO of India's biggest</span>
<span style="style.default_1">pizza company's favorite dish.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">If Panda had told Moose</span>
<span style="style.default_1">he missed Delhi's "rajma-chawal"...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">she would've exploded.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And Giraffe?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">For some people, getting a girlfriend</span>
<span style="style.default_1">was as tough as waking up early.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">If they make it, they're sorted.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Did he have to be my brother?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Dengue fever claims lives in Delhi.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Dengue spreads through the capital city.</span>
Santoshi!
I told you! Don't wash Aisha's plates
with tap water. Use boiled water.
Fruits, vegetables or plates.
Wash everything with boiled water. Please.
She's fragile.
Jeet, don't cut vegetables without gloves.
Remember? Gloves are a must.
Please wear them.
<span style="style.default_1">Dengue mosquitoes breed</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in clean water too.</span>
Jeet, we'll have to fumigate
the farmhouse.
<span style="style.default_1">Dengue mosquitoes can survive</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from July to October.</span>
Hi, beautiful. You're looking lovely.
Sit here.
Come. Sit here.
Thanks, Moose.
My baby. It's the Tree of Life.
<span style="style.default_1">You're so innocent</span>
<span style="style.default_1">O my innocent one</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Your innocent ways</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Take my breath away</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You're so innocent</span>
<span style="style.default_1">O my innocent one</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Your innocent ways</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Take my breath away</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Your innocent ways bewilder me</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Your child-like ways</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Take my breath away</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You surprise me still</span>
<span style="style.default_1">With your childish ways</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Your childish ways</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Now that you have stolen my heart</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Don't turn away from me, darling</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You have changed my life</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Don't you now change</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You took away my heart</span>
<span style="style.default_1">O my heart</span>
<span style="style.default_1">O my heart</span>
I just knew...
Mom! Dad!
Mom!
That's Ishaan.
<span style="style.default_1">Ishaan!</span>
-Quick!
-What happened?
What's wrong?
Mamma's here. What happened?
She was just lying here.
Lift her up.
-Aishi, turn the TV off.
-One minute.
Are you guys getting a divorce?
If you are, then I'm living with you.
Moose drives me nuts.
It's about your lungs.
You have something called
Busulfan lung damage.
It's led to a condition called
Pulmonary Fibrosis.
-Have you seen the pollution in Delhi?
-That's not the cause.
It's the side effects of chemo.
But that was 14 years ago, right?
We knew the side effects of chemo
could show up years later.
But we had no choice, Aishi.
How long does it take to cure
this Pulmonary Fibrosis?
It's a serious condition.
There's no cure yet. But...
the doctors have said with good care--
You mean I'm going to die?
Answer me, Moose.
<span style="style.default_1">Moose knew there was a chance</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I'd be born with SCID and die young.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So, should she have aborted me?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Moose had no words to say for six months</span>
<span style="style.default_1">after my death.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And Panda refused to talk about it.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So when his London office called,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Panda's answer was obvious.</span>
You made a very wise decision
to move back to London.
It won't be easy. I know.
We also have been through this situation.
We know exactly how you feel.
As you know, Vivek's mother passed away
a month after Aisha died.
She was only 73.
Running from pillar to post.
The treatments, doctors, hospitals,
we did it all.
To no avail.
If you just excuse me, I'll be right back.
Let's order. Or I'll faint out of hunger.
-Should I go check on her?
-No, it's okay. She'll be fine.
My wife's right there... can I?
Please move outside.
Just two minutes, please.
Is her mother-in-law's death
and Aisha's the same?
Obviously not.
Leave it now.
Once we move to London,
she'll be out of our hair.
I'm not going anywhere, Niren.
What are you saying?
Have you thought about Aisha's clothes?
Do we take them? Or throw them out?
What if her paintings get damaged?
And her school bag?
Do I junk her books?
-Stop it, Aditi.
-Why should I?
I will not leave Aisha alone here.
London is Aisha's home too.
I can't live without you.
-For how long do I keep following you?
-I came to London for you.
You didn't come for me.
You came for Aisha.
And even if you did, so what?
What are you implying?
You came for your family.
Want a medal?
If it's too much, why marry?
You could've escaped all this.
What has gotten into you?
Making a mountain out of a molehill.
We were just ordering dinner.
Then go and eat!
Your food must be getting cold.
I don't know who I'm talking to sometimes.
Do I even know you?
What have I been doing
for the last 20 years?
Looked after Aisha, 24/7.
And now that I'm 50, what am I left with?
She's gone.
Ishaan's busy with his life
as he should be. But you?
You're all busy.
Where's all this coming from?
I'm always here for you.
What do I have except my work?
Are you there for me?
I'm not. That's just it.
I don't know how to be there
for anyone but Aisha.
Why are you running away, Niren?
Stop for a moment.
Talk to yourself. Talk to me.
To Aisha.
-So what if she's dead? Chapter closed?
-Look, do what's right.
I did what I could...
You of course think I did nothing.
Because you did everything for Aisha,
not me.
It's the limit.
How easily you say we should live apart.
<span style="style.default_1">If I had my way, I'd rewind life</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and change every scene.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Fun fact is I can neither rewind life now</span>
<span style="style.default_1">nor could I then.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">When the doctors said</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I had five years more to live...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Moose fast forwarded</span>
<span style="style.default_1">her feelings of sadness.</span>
Ishaan, sir?
Sir?
Ma'am's calling you.
She wants you to hurry up.
-What is it?
-Put your shoes on. Hurry!
-Why?
-Because I said so.
Where to, Mamma?
We'll have a fifth family member!
We're adopting.
I want you two to meet him
before your Dad does.
Ishaan, Aisha!
I'm waiting in the car. Now!
-Hi, Tara.
-Hi, Aditi. How are you?
-What's his name?
-Vivan.
And the other babies?
-We've come to pick ours. So excited!
-They're at the back.
What's Moose up to?
-Let's go?
-Yeah.
Come on.
We're a family of five now!
Go see which one you like.
Mom.
You made such a fuss about a dog
in London.
You said Aisha was allergic.
Now you're getting her a puppy?
She can take anti-allergy pills.
Now the risk is greater.
There's a risk in everything, Ishaan.
Besides nothing matters to me
more than her happiness.
Rolo!
Moose!
Did you hear me? He's my Rolo.
It's okay if I die now.
Come, let's meet Rolo.
Aishi, bring Rolo outside.
He'll break something in there.
Coming!
Your grandma is scared of dogs.
Let's show her.
No! Get away!
He won't bite.
All three of us lived here.
Now look at you, spoilt rich brat.
You can say that now.
When we moved to London,
I thought Dadda would sell my toys.
I thought I'd have to earn money
for Aishi's operation.
But they were good days, Mom.
You know I didn't keep you away
from us on purpose?
I know.
You know that boy in your class...
What's his name? Karan.
You know everyone's name?
I know everything!
Aisha has a crush on him.
How do you know?
Checking our phones?
Haven't checked yours yet.
Tell you what...
ask Karan to take Aishi on a date.
How on earth
did you concoct this stupid,
ridiculous, weird plan, Mom?
If Aishi finds out we've set up
a date for her, she'd go ballistic.
Who'll tell her?
Do as I say. Or I'll do it.
Aisha thinks he likes her too.
And maybe he does.
Or maybe because of her illness...
I don't know.
But there's no harm in asking.
Worst case, he'll say no.
You'll be marrying her off soon!
If only I could, Ishaan.
You're an ace at emotional blackmail.
Tell me... do you and Karan...
Does he brush his teeth regularly?
If he does, no harm kissing him.
-He's just a friend.
-It's just a kiss.
Look at this sweater.
I hope they've got my size.
Look.
They don't.
Excuse me.
One second, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.
-Do you have a small?
-It should be on the rack.
-It's not. I checked.
Maybe it's out of stock.
You'll have to order it.
Here's a small.
Ma'am, you can't take that off.
Why not?
Ma'am, you just can't. Store policy.
We do have other styles.
Please have a look.
Moose, it's not that great.
Let's go. Come on.
-What are you doing?
-Keep an eye out.
Must you prove to the world
that you're crazy?
Tell me if someone's coming.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Do you need any help?
-No, thank you.
-Please call me if you do.
Moose, hurry up!
Come.
Aishi, don't go beyond kissing,
I'm telling you.
No sex! You're too young.
Anything you want to discuss,
we can discuss it.
Please don't give me a heart attack
and say you've done it.
Moose, please!
You haven't done it yet, right?
How old were you when...
-When?
-...you and Dad did it for the first time?
<span style="style.default_1">Talking about sex is against our culture.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But to permit a couple to have sex,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the whole family is invited.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The priest reads powerful mantras.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And they play wedding music too.</span>
-Do you know what they're all thinking?
-What?
That we'll have sex tonight.
Imagine the performance pressure!
I'm taking full advantage
of the presidential suite
your colleagues gifted us.
Actually, Papa has spoken
to his brother...
you know he owns a hotel in Chandni Chowk?
We're staying there tonight.
They'll be hurt otherwise.
Please understand.
It isn't that bad.
It's big enough for us.
Anyway it's not as though
we're sleeping tonight!
Your hair is so beautiful.
Like my hair?
Then sleep with it.
Take this. And this.
-Not my wedding turban!
-Enjoy!
Aditi!
Uncle!
<span style="style.default_1">Hail Moose the Tigress!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Moose wanted me to experience</span>
<span style="style.default_1">everything in life...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">before I ran out of time.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You know like love, sex...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But hearing about her wedding night,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I didn't want a crash course from her!</span>
I'm Aisha's friend. Karan.
Karan! Hi, come.
Ishaan!
Hi, Karan.
-I think that's Karan.
-You go now, please.
Rolo.
-Hi.
-Hi. Is that Rolo?
-Want some?
-No, thank you.
Can I get you something?
-Double espresso.
-Sure.
Yeah.
<span style="style.default_1">Ishaan, now listen to your mother.</span>
Hello, Ishaan.
Get Karan to see Aisha's artwork.
An excuse to send them to her room.
<span style="style.default_1">Are you listening? Hello.</span>
Ishaan!
<span style="style.default_1">Giraffe knew Moose would drive him crazy</span>
<span style="style.default_1">if he stayed in Delhi.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Education was just an excuse</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to escape to London.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But I had no excuse or way out.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I missed Giraffe a lot.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">He was my partner in dealing</span>
<span style="style.default_1">with Moose and Panda.</span>
Easy.
<span style="style.default_1">As soon as he left,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the house turned into a training camp.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Project Aisha.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Husband and wife got busy</span>
<span style="style.default_1">pumping my lungs.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">They meant well but... poor me!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">No matter what I wore,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the oxygen pipe was my accessory.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Because Panda had to go to work,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">he would sleep at night.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But Moose!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">She didn't have much confidence</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in doctors.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then Panda was having feelings of FOMO.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So whenever he could,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">he'd work from home.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">To be specific, in my room.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Clearly, living in London taught them</span>
<span style="style.default_1">nothing about privacy!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">A bit late to teach them.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Karan's visiting. Mum, Dad, out!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">They acted as if their love marriage</span>
<span style="style.default_1">had taken place ages ago.</span>
Hi, Uncle. Hey, Moose.
-Hi, Karan, how are you?
-I'm good.
Why did he use that door?
He should use the main door.
Hush. He's a friend.
I don't like this.
-A portrait of Rolo?
-No, a self-portrait.
Ma'am, your tea.
Santoshi, I'll have the usual.
The usual?
In a minute.
Don't you understand art?
-Meaning? Where are you?
-Take a closer look.
I can't see you.
Right there, on the bed.
When I'm not around,
I'll still be here. Forever.
Don't you guys think Aisha could be
a great inspirational speaker?
<span style="style.default_1">As if I wasn't tortured enough,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the training camp acquired a new goal.</span>
Tell ma'am we're leaving in five minutes.
<span style="style.default_1">Thanks, Karan.</span>
-Hi, Uncle.
-Hi.
No bananas?
-I beg your pardon! Do forgive me.
-It's okay. I'll go get Aishi.
<span style="style.default_1">In any case, what did I ever do in my life</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to inspire people?</span>
Ladies and gentlemen, Aisha Chaudhary.
<span style="style.default_1">There I was in front of a thousand people.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Sure, I was nervous.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But the audience were more nervous</span>
<span style="style.default_1">than me.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">They knew I knew I could die at any time.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So whatever I said would be a hit.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">By force of habit...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I threw them a trump card...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Some people even cried.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I was only 18...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and my happiness hormones were exploding.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Love, sex, deceit hormones.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I was worried their Project Aisha</span>
<span style="style.default_1">would end with Karan becoming my brother.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I hear things hot up in your 40s.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">That's if you survive till then!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But I could hear my life ticking</span>
<span style="style.default_1">like a time bomb.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It was now or never.</span>
Aisha, what's wrong?
Come here.
What's wrong, baby?
Never mind.
Go to sleep.
<span style="style.default_1">Gradually, Project Aisha expanded.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">First they pumped my lungs...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">then they thought I had a hole</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in my heart.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Because they never had a heartbreak.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">They were soul mates since</span>
<span style="style.default_1">their school days.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">They called Ishaan home from college,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on an emergency vacation.</span>
What nonsense!
She has a medical condition,
so she can't parasail.
We're taking responsibility,
so what's your problem?
It's still risky, right?
If she has a medical emergency,
we'll be making the headlines.
That's nonsense!
Moose, it's okay. You guys go ahead.
-Of course not.
-No way.
We all go, or none of us do.
<span style="style.default_1">He was right.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I didn't feel like dying that soon.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But keeping me happy became more</span>
<span style="style.default_1">important than keeping me alive.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Giraffe had umpteen breakups.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But he was never taken</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on an emergency vacation.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It wasn't easy making me happy.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">In the air there was</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the air pressure problem.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Underwater I could only handle</span>
<span style="style.default_1">two minutes. But what's two minutes?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It was pointless arguing</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in the middle of the ocean.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">They were trying so hard,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I thought let's get over with it. Jump in.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">There are moments</span>
<span style="style.default_1">when you live life to the fullest.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And when you're in that moment...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">you realize that life is</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a most wondrous thing.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Life didn't give me those moments...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Moose and Panda created them.</span>
Aishi...
Baby, look at Mamma.
Oh, God, please.
Niren!
Her oxygen levels are dropping.
Aishi? Is the machine working?
The pilot must make an emergency landing.
Ishaan, ask the stewardess to get us
their spare oxygen tank. Now!
You can't enter the cockpit.
Ma'am, it's an emergency,
I must talk to the pilot.
-What's wrong?
-My daughter can't breathe.
-I need oxygen for my sister.
-Sir, please don't run.
Just look at Mamma.
Keep your eyes open.
Her lungs are weak.
She can't handle low air pressure.
Please lower the plane's altitude.
Ma'am, calm down.
What is your name?
I know Captain Kapoor. Let me talk to him.
<span style="style.default_1">Have you noticed where oxygen cylinders</span>
<span style="style.default_1">are kept on a flight?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Moose always did her homework.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But when I had to sign</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a life risk form at the airport...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Panda was shaken.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">He said, "Aishi, let's not go."</span>
<span style="style.default_1">After my heartbreak over Karan,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I was in the mood to die.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I insisted we travel and even signed</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the airline waiver.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">As a spirit I believe we remain on Earth</span>
<span style="style.default_1">until we learn certain lessons.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I guess I wasn't done learning yet.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">There's no other reason</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I didn't die on that flight home.</span>
What happened?
Don't let Aisha's smile deceive you,
her condition is worse.
It's a natural progression of her illness.
We must go for a lung transplant now.
We discussed this when Aisha was
first diagnosed.
Maybe it's time.
You know I'm against a transplant.
It'll prolong her life
by ten years, Aditi.
Start the process.
Tell me where to sign.
And how much it'll cost.
-We're doing it.
-No, we're not.
-We're doing it, Aditi.
-Over my dead body!
-What nonsense?
-Let's discuss this somewhere else.
Why would Nirvick suggest
a transplant needlessly?
He's a doctor. Let him do his job.
Answer me then.
A lung transplant is challenging
even for a healthy body.
She's so unwell. How will she cope?
You want her to end her days
tied to a hospital bed?
Will she be able to walk?
Will she be happy?
Could you face such a life?
Or must she live for your peace of mind?
Do we let her die?
She's not only your child...
she's mine too.
This time your stubbornness won't work.
-I'm being stubborn?
-Yeah...
Stubborn!
I've researched her medical condition
for years.
I badgered the doctors over every detail.
So what if I'm being stubborn!
Sorry. This time I'm not backing down.
We're going for a transplant.
It's my final decision.
So you'll blindly follow the doctor's
advice and not use your own brain?
Our know-how is irrelevant here.
Their training and experience
is what matters.
What did you do when it came to Tanya?
You listened to the doctors.
And what happened?
They aren't always right.
No doctor can guarantee a successful
outcome. Will you guarantee it?
<span style="style.default_1">When I was a kid if anyone gave me</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a chocolate, I'd share this secret.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">"I have an elder sister, Tanya.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">She lives with Mother Mary."</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It was a secret because Moose never talked</span>
<span style="style.default_1">about her in Panda's presence.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Panda wanted to forget</span>
<span style="style.default_1">that their first born was Tanya.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I once asked Moose if Panda</span>
<span style="style.default_1">would forget me too.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Will they not have photos of me?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Like Tanya?</span>
Niren's blood was meant to increase
Tanya's hemoglobin...
instead it has made her worse.
Tanya has SCID,
Severe Combined Immune Deficiency.
If only you had come earlier, I would've
suggested you take her to London.
But now it's too late.
Not more than 24 hours.
I've been telling you
for the last 5 months...
something's seriously wrong with Tanya.
But neither you nor those ten doctors
listened to me.
"Children always get fever.
Have a Valium. Stop worrying."
It's all your fault.
No, baby. Please.
Don't cry. Please.
Mother Mary understands your pain.
Then why doesn't she save my Taanu?
Because she understands her pain too.
Don't cry.
Mamma may be selfish...
but not that selfish
to ignore your suffering.
Go, my baby.
Next time come back healed.
<span style="style.default_1">So this is when Moose had her vision</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and became a Christian.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">That vision was Mother Mary.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I love you, Panda.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Where can we find husbands like him...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">who love their wives unconditionally?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Fun fact, I owe my existence</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to my sister's death.</span>
Your paintings should be in an exhibition.
What do you want?
Honestly. They're really good.
Panda...
Cut to the chase.
Tell me what you really want.
Uncle Nirvick suggests you have
a lung transplant.
It'll prolong your life by ten years.
Shouldn't we take that chance?
Why? You think it'll be easier to die
at 28 instead of 18?
We'll get to spend
ten more years together, Aishi.
I want you for as long as possible.
This isn't enough.
I've had enough, Panda.
I don't want any more problems.
Who knows what happens now, Anshu.
Niren's with her. I'll call you later.
-Where do you want to sit?
-Near Moose.
Come, my baby.
Moose, sit here.
I want to paint you.
No, no, please. I don't like posing.
You'll treasure the painting after I die.
Nonsense! You are not going to die.
Obviously not this minute.
Sit down, please.
-Moose, cover your head.
-I never cover my head.
Let the painter do her job. Go on.
Okay?
Over your shoulder.
Okay now?
Stop. Statue. Don't move.
Don't make such a sad face.
I'll tell you what...
think of something nice.
Like when Panda kissed you the first time.
Or when you were pregnant with me.
You were round like a football.
Hey, Internet Queen!
I was just checking...
Aish.
Aish, what's wrong?
Giraffe, I don't want to die.
How can I leave you, Moose, Panda?
Okay, Aish.
I know this is a horrid, shitty situation.
I understand that.
<span style="style.default_1">Remember you won't be alone for long.</span>
Mom, Dad and I will join you very soon.
<span style="style.default_1">We'll be together again.</span>
A new family isn't created every time.
The same family gets reincarnated.
<span style="style.default_1">Like in this lifetime, you're my sister...</span>
maybe in the next, you'll be my Dad.
And Mom will be your wife.
No, wait. Let's not make Mom your wife.
<span style="style.default_1">Let's make her Jeet, our cook.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Our extended family is reincarnated too.</span>
So she won't enter our rooms
without knocking!
You know what?
Next time you can be Rolo.
Eat, sleep, poop, bark, even bite,
if something enrages you.
Don't forget to call.
Every day.
<span style="style.default_1">Moose got advice from Indian doctors...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">British, American, Australian</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and even Canadian.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">She worked day and night.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My coughing fits helped.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">They gave her a little break,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but not a full night's sleep.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">This week she slept for 16 hours only.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You must know what happens</span>
<span style="style.default_1">when people don't sleep.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">They don't absorb dopamine.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Their glucose processing shuts down.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And finally their brain's</span>
<span style="style.default_1">neural connections short circuit.</span>
Aditi, what's wrong?
What are you doing?
Stop it. What's going on?
Must be a bad dream.
-Go back to sleep.
-I want some tea.
All men are bastards!
You'll wake Aisha. What's this drama?
Get off me!
Get off! Control yourself.
Come, let's go and have a cup of tea.
-She wants to have some tea.
-Yes, sure.
Ma'am!
Grab her legs!
Don't let her go.
She'll be fine.
-Take care of Aisha.
-I'm here.
Jeet, open the car door.
-What's wrong with her?
-We'll have to take her to Vimhans.
-The mental hospital?
-She's having a psychotic breakdown.
Will she be okay?
Don't worry, Panda. Moose will be fine.
I'm not thinking about her.
I won't kick the bucket
until Moose comes home.
I can't bear to think...
how miserable she'll make your life
when I'm gone.
I'll talk to Ishaan.
Maybe she'd feel better if he came home.
Panda, there's only one sane person
left in this family.
Let him be.
Jeet, where's Aisha?
Upstairs with sir.
-Anshu, I'm going up.
-I'll just come.
Please give me a cup of tea.
Guys, control!
It's only been a week.
I've missed you.
You're back, my drama queen.
A gift for you.
Someone had to look after the house.
And Panda.
So I did.
I even finished writing my book.
Not everyone can
avoid responsibilities like you.
Niren, let's look for a publisher.
By the way, the publisher
really liked her book.
-What?
-Bloomsbury.
Wow!
I should do double drama next time...
so you'll write a sequel!
Aishi.
Here you go. You're okay.
Breathe, baby.
Try and lie back.
I'll tell Santoshi to make
chocolate waffles for breakfast.
Niren, come home. Quick.
Yes.
Ishaan, wake up.
Aisha's not good. Stay with her.
I have to make a few calls.
I know the book launch is tomorrow...
but I must have a copy
of Aisha's book today.
I know, but please understand...
time is precious for her.
Hey, Sport.
Look...
You called and I came.
Hello, Nirvick.
She's using a lot of oxygen.
I've ordered four more cylinders.
How soon can you get here?
Please hurry.
Aishi, can you tell whether
this is Ishaan's hand or mine?
You've grown old, Panda.
You should use Moose's anti-aging cream.
Aishi.
You know...
I act like I'm very strong...
like things are cool with me.
And everything is okay.
But in my heart...
a day doesn't pass when
I am not thinking of you.
Giraffe loves you, Aishi.
What is it?
Careful, baby.
And my kissy?
-Only two cylinders? We ordered four.
-They're in the car.
Go get them and clear out the empty ones.
Ma'am, the soup.
Aishi!
Come to me.
Look!
Your book.
"Aisha Chaudhary."
<span style="style.default_1">I arrived with a bang</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and I leave with one too.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But the crowd's bigger this time.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You feel so special</span>
<span style="style.default_1">when people cry for you.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But did you notice Moose's wardrobe?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">She seems dressed for a birthday party.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">That's the way it should be.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Death-days are like birthdays.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">They must be celebrated.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Moose stole my Tree of Life necklace</span>
<span style="style.default_1">as a return gift.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Fun fact, it seems parking lots in Delhi</span>
<span style="style.default_1">have higher premiums than graves.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So I was buried double-decker style.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Luckily atop my sister's coffin.</span>
"FAREWELL NIREN"
What can I say? I completely forgot
I used to play in a band.
Having a blast.
-A grand farewell was a must! Right?
-Thank you.
Aditi's coming, right?
Excuse me. A whiskey soda, please.
Niren Chaudhary.
You've always had the last word
at every meeting. So why not here?
So, before you run away to London,
you could do your apologizing now.
Here's your chance.
Come on up here, Mr. Chaudhary.
Thanks for this joyous
and amazing farewell party.
If I knew you'd enjoy
my farewell so much...
you should've given me a hint,
I'd have left ages ago.
The first time I went to London
was in 1996 for Aisha's treatment.
I had no money for the airfare.
Someone at the office heard.
And soon an empty lunch box
was passed around.
You gave me whatever you could
and bid me a warm farewell.
As your boss,
you were my responsibility...
but it's you guys who looked out for me.
Then don't go, Niren.
Aditi doesn't want us
to leave Delhi either.
But pain leaves you so empty.
It wears you down.
The only difference is I deal with pain
in one way, Aditi in another.
Our home here...
so filled with memories of Aisha...
haunts me constantly.
Maybe that's why I can't bear
to look at photos of my children.
Ever since she left us...
I can't enter her room.
I feel scared...
that if I entered I'd lose her again.
But last night I did go in.
I sat down.
It felt as though she was there.
I looked at her drawing books.
She had this habit of hiding stories...
in her paintings, writings and videos.
After Aisha passed away, no one had
the courage to open her laptop.
But maybe we should have a long time ago.
<span style="style.default_1">This means one of you knew my password.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I always suspected Moose.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Actually, any spy agency in the world</span>
<span style="style.default_1">would recruit Moose.</span>
Moosical...
Missing me?
Want to cry? Okay, cry.
But don't throttle Panda's neck
again in your sleep.
I promised Panda...
until you were back from
the mental hospital, I wouldn't die.
The promise is slightly risky,
so I'm recording this video.
If I do die, then we won't
get to say goodbye.
I've thought about death every day.
I've literally gobbled life up.
So death doesn't worry me.
Don't let it worry you either.
I've lived life to the fullest.
Moose, thank you for not aborting me.
And Panda, you spent your entire life
slaving away for us...
for party-crashers like us.
Giraffe, a part of me
will always be with you.
Please none of this "survivor's guilt"
or I'll whack you.
I'm sorry, Panda.
I couldn't go for that lung transplant.
Remember my self-portrait?
Even when I'm not around, I'll be there.
Forever.
Don't worry about me.
I'm chilling with Tanya...
while you all are watching this video.
We're partying together...
in the sky.
The Pink Sky.
Take care of my Rolo.
That's nothing.
Look over there.
<span style="style.default_1">Moose had said, next time she'd do</span>
<span style="style.default_1">more drama so I'd write a sequel.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Take this movie to be the sequel</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of my book.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So it's written, Moose.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Panda, find a publisher!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Looking at them now, you'd think</span>
<span style="style.default_1">their sex life is still active.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I know it's wrong to discuss</span>
<span style="style.default_1">your parents' sex life.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It is still wrong!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Aishi, are you listening?</span>
