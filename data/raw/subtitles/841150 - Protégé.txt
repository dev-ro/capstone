Why do people use drugs?
I could never figured it out...
...until Quin and Fan died
It's all because of the emptiness inside
So what's worse...
...the emptiness or the drugs?
I really don't know
Nick, the "caterer" in position in 1 minute
Hello
Get in the JV1889 to your right
Okay
Get the 3 stooges beside you to follow you
They're like you,
each holding a lemon tea
You three, follow me to the car
Why it always have to be lemon tea...
Can't they switch to soda for once?
It's here!
The suspect's car is here, get ready!
It's a 7-seat silver van
Plate no, JV1889
Unit A, go now!
Go
Unit A has lost the suspect:
he turned left onto Jordan
Unit B in pursuit
Go
Hello
Nick, I made the drop
Call it a day!
The suspect is on Boundary heading
towards Kowloon City
The suspect has turned onto Earl Street
Slow down! Keep your distance,
he might see you!
Nick, the "caterer" is in position
4th floor, 407, head for Shatin
It's a green light! Don't stop, keep going!
I knew they would pull this!
Think they are dealing with rookies!?
He's staring at you
Get going! Move!
He's sniffing us! Don't look back!
The road split ahead!
Which way should I take?
Stay on course!
Damn! He's gone!
"Client" lost in the roundabout
No sweat! Unit B back in action!
Easy on the turns ahead,
don't let him slip off!
Copy
You are the only tail in business
Heads up
He's turning!
Take the left lane!
I can't, I'm blocked,
Watch it!
Unit B has lost the target
The target went into Kowloon City
Nick, I lost my tail now
- Sand Martin Bridge
- Copy
Not too bad
We managed to stick with them this long
Let's go
- Back to station?
- No. I got a game to go to
Split it up!
Get out!
Hurry up!
- Yes
- The party's over
- It's a wrap
- Copy
Mom! I'm hungry
Just wait a little longer,
Mrs. Luk is not back yet
Once she pays me...
...I'll treat you to a dinner out
Can you spare me some instant noodles?
I'm out
Take some bread instead?
My salary is stalled...
I'll pay you back once I get my money
Eat it...
How much?
800 for three
800...
Deal!
Quin, I've got a new number
Nick?
Yes, big sister?
Quin is in the ER again, Come quickly!
Dear...
Go home and get your father's
personal things...
I have a date! Get your sister to do it!
- You...
- Hi, Nick!
Nick
- Nick
- How is he?
Please convince him to have the operation
He shouldn't stall any longer
It'll be alright
Can I see him now?
Over there
Nurse
Nurse...
Just a second
What do you need?
I need to pee
- I'll get you a bed-pan
- Wait...
There are women here...
Why don't you go to a private hospital?
It's been a really rough year
My kidneys are ruined by diabetes
My wife has high blood pressure
and a bad cholesterol level
My little daughter was born with VSD
Her sister is healthy
But she's a monster!
Did you see her manners?
Can you stand her? I can't!
Take it easy, your health comes first
Your wife wants you
to get a kidney transplant
But I'll die faster
if the operation goes badly!
I don't think you have much choice
When I send the little one abroad
for her operation...
...I'll get mine done as well
- Did the drop go well?
- Yes, it did
I wanted to talk to you though
What is it?
I've found a customer
I want to bank one deal on my own
Just a sec...
What did you say?
I want to do one trade myself
I need to buy a house
How much?
Four sets "Hong Kong Dollars"
I'm asking about the house!
Please grease me on this one
I'm tired of borrowing!
Who's your buyer?
You taught me not to ask questions
Are you sure he's cool?
Just need to trust me
Yeah, right...
What kind of house do you need?
Can't you even afford the down payment?
Good for nothing... what's that?
Hey, easy on that
Hide it
Get rid of the leftovers
Your wife will kill me if she finds out
You are kidding? Nothing go wasted!
Where is everyone?
They went home to get Quin's stuff
What about you?
I was waiting for you
Do you want to go to a movie?
Someone gave me two coupons!
Come on...
It's early, we can walk to the cinema
Have a safe ride
Let's see...
What's you name?
Jane-jane
Jane-jane, want some candy?
Eat your vegetables
Have some fish
Do you have rats in your flat?
A rat crawled into our bed last night
It almost bit her!
I put out some rat poison
Me too!
But they just keep coming back
Try another brand!
We can buy some after dinner
Thanks
Do you sell bootlegs?
They belong to Mrs. Luk's son
I work for Luk and he lets me stay here
Would you like some tea?
Do you live by yourself?
Yes
I broke up with my husband not too long ago
I wanted to return to my parents' home
But my father refused to take us in
Since my husband had priors causing trouble
with my folks
My father disliked him
and did not condone our marriage
He said my husband was a worthless bum,
which is kind of true
You don't need
to tell me all these...
You're right
This couch seems very comfy
You bet... you should try
I don't know
how such a good sofa ended up here
Have some tea
Yes
Hey...
What's up?
Come pick me up at the hospital now!
Let's talk again some other time,
I have to go,
Thank you
Oh, it's nothing
Go to the "kitchen"! Something happened
What are we waiting for?
I don't know where it is
He's here
Relax, he's safe!
Who is he?
Nick, he looks after transport
You could have warned me!
I almost had a heart attack!
Let's go
Open up!
Moron...
What is it?
It won't clog
What the hell do you mean it won't clog?
Give me a cigarette
Light it
Hurry
Magnesium?
Magnesium is gray!
This is potassium nitrate!
It's basic chemistry!
Where did you get this junk?
The regular place in Shamshuipo!
They screwed up big time!
"Re-cook" now
or we'll lose the whole batch!
Son of a bitch!
I'll burn down their shop tomorrow!
Just shut up
and give me two sets "US Dollars" now!
Hurry!
Pour it in!
Enough!
Hurry!
Mix it!
"Double Uoglobe Brand"
It used to be morphine bricks...
...which took a long time to process
Now they send it pre-made
That's 99% pure...
...heroin bricks
The cops call them "No. 4",
We call them "US Dollars"
It's lethal if taken straight
That's why you need to cut it,
then you get "HK Dollars"
The same stuff you always dropped off
Our product is high-grade
The dealers will cut it further
with glucose,
K or Blue Devils
Sometimes, even plaster
Anything goes just to boost
their profit margin
We, however, only make good stuff
to keep the bigger dealers coming back
Know why it's shaped like this?
For easy transport
Wait
4 sets
Each weighs 350 grams
65% pure
This stuff is hot!
The market price is $320 grand per set
Don't try selling short
I've thought it over
You would need to learn
all the ropes somehow
It's time you get some hands-on experience
My health is a mess
I'll have to pass the business
onto someone eventually
I am a nerve wreck in trusting people
Well, you seem to prove yourself
...and pretty smart
Just remember...
...never take risks
Oh...
My sister-in-law... she's a good girl
Guess what my wife told me just now
She cried so hard when you stood her up
I...
What's the problem?
Once we're in-laws,
you can still call me big brother
Just the same!
She once asked me what my line of work was
I couldn't answer
What could I say?
Drugs?
When do I pay for the merchandise?
No rush, make yourself some money first
Bye
- I'll go up with you
- I'll be fine
Bye
What are you doing?
Feeding pigeons
Aren't you afraid of avian flu?
No! Are you?
Quit fooling around...
Dangerous stuff...
Cut it out, Let's go!
1,28 million
All used notes...
...all specially marked
and undetectable
Where is this batch going?
Overseas...
Will let you know once it's done
Hey, we need picture evidence
Last night was sudden: couldn't be helped
But I managed to visit the kitchen though
You did?!
Met the chef, he's in his 50s
He has two young sidekicks
You should hurry if you want to catch them
Do you know we've got a new boss?
I read it in the paper
I went through the operation with him
a few days ago
And we reviewed each step together
The conclusion is...
We'll be able to round up your drivers...
some of your clients...
plus the 3 cooks you've just met...
...it's only a dozen people or so
Boss said we've put in a lot of time
and money
Yet Quin's supplier is still unknown
The main point is...
Lin Quin controls more than
half of the local supply
It's a monthly turnover of at least $30M
Where does the money go?
Could Lin be backed by other people?
What does the boss want?
He wants to know
if you're OK to stay undercover further
It's 7 years now
That's why he wants your opinion
Is there any way to nail everyone?
Lin Quin is ill
He's going to pass on
more and more duties to me
Even if there is a backer
...I'll probably never meet him
Who knows how long it will take?
It could be several years
We don't mind waiting
The Chief is impressed with your work,
You're in line for the SPC rank
I prefer cash
Me too
Oh, congratulations!
What for?
Chief Superintendent, ay!
But that's as high as I can go
Unless...
Unless we can nail
this entire drug supply line
It's all up to you
We must tie the whole network together,
so that we'll have solid evidence in court
And as soon as you smell
Quin plans escape route
We'll arrest him and close the case
I suppose he must have a few passports
If he ever gets to
an international airport hub...
...we'll lose him for good
I know... what's the hurry?
I have to join a soccer game
How's your girlfriend?
You two still fighting?
Aren't you getting married?
She's pregnant, right?
- Where's the key?
- I thought you had it...
Gotta go... Call me
C'mon: you want business or not?
I'll give you $50 more
Elaine is upstairs
She only keeps watch!
I'll fix you up with another girl!
Let me know when she's available
It's for you
Uncle... what is it?
Remember what to say?
Thank you!
Can you do any house chores?
Yes!
Go find your child a kindergarten
This is no place for a little girl
Find out what I need at home...
detergent, toilet paper, etc,
If you're available tonight,
come by for dinner
I haven't cooked in a while
Okay
By the way my name is Fan
Call me Nick
How much do you want?
I want soup too
Sure...
More?
Less
Less... okay
- How's that?
- That's it
Good
The price is largely
affected by the shipping cost
If the cargo is shipped C&F here,
you need to pay at least 20% more
We can cut corners by shipping ourselves,
but it's not that easy
The man holding the bag
gets the ownership and blame
If they get caught before the handover,
you don't pay
Get caught after, you pay it all
Those are the rules
Now it's ours
I thought they stop water transport
Everyone thinks so,
which makes it the safest way
I have one!
Me too!
Hi Cal!
This is Cal, the warehouse keeper
This is Nick, he handles the drivers
Now that you've been introduced,
try not to see each other again
Use unmarked phones
to arrange all deliveries
Is the warehouse nearby?
Mind your own business
Just tell him to collect the goods
once they arrive
Call him
when the kitchen opens for business
He'll deliver to a secure spot,
and you send a runner for pick up
It's the same way you make a delivery!
Okay
Relax, he'll be in charge soon
Mine is new to me...
Everyone has to shield off himself
Don't ask what doesn't concern you
Remember, never take risks
The warehouse keeper, chef and clients
should never come into contact
Only the runners get caught,
and the trail ends there
As "wholesalers",
we don't get our hands dirty
We oversee from a distance
Just like me...
If it wasn't for salvaging the "dishes"...
...I would never go near the kitchen
There is no room for error in this trade
Anyone who gets caught...
does 20 to 30 years minimum
Enough, brother
You sofa is comfortable
Go back to sleep
I have frequent insomnia
Relax...
Promise me
Once we get married...
You have to treat me better
You can't hit me again
What does it feel like?
From head...
...to toe
Every inch of my skin experiences a rush...
...for the longest time...
...for as long as I want
I'm asking about being high
High...
It's like all my worries disappear
I can dream... whenever I want to
It's a dream come true
But it's not a dream...
It's real... it's real!
Yes... Yes...
Yes... Yes...
Honey
Honey, what are you doing here?
I've been looking all over for you
Where's our kid?
Where is she, honey?
Honey, don't run away from me...
Don't... honey
Honey, why so silly?
Why put yourself through this pain?
Honey...
I have stuff on me
Take some, you'll feel better
- C'mon, take some...
- No... No!
Take some and you'll feel better,
No... No!
Honey...
Honey... Honey... open up!
Honey, I love you very much!
Don't leave me alone...
Mom, what are you doing?
Nick
Nick...
Nick
My husband has found me
Can I stay here for a couple of days?
No!
Don't shout!
You tried to get me hooked!
What?
What did you put in the cigarette?
Nothing! Why would I...
Don't come here again
I swear I didn't do anything
I would never harm you!
Listen carefully!
It's not my business! Just go!
Please...
- Please, listen to me...
- Go away...! Go!
Please help us...
If you don't want to help me,
at least help my child!
You're scaring your child
Just go to rehab!
But they'll take my child away!
I can't live without her!
I really can't help you
Just tie me down
I can kick it in a few days
You're crazy! Go!
I can do it! I really can!
Bite me... bite me!
Harder!
Stop crying...
I've been trying...
but I just can't kick the habit!
My husband is a junkie
I urged him... to quit
He said it's impossible to quit
I tried to prove to him
that it was possible
That's how I started using
It turns out that you can't quit
If I don't leave him...
I'll never be able to quit!
Please help me!
Please, I beg you
Don't move!
Bite it!
Your mom is fine
She's alright
Let's go outside
Sit here
Thank you
Don't be afraid, Go on,
We'll wait for you here
Nick!
Check this out!
Get a new car, dad! Yours is outdated!
What's this? Why are you smoking?
You're disgusting!
What? At least I'm not smoking weed
Who taught you to smoke?!
Why are you hanging out with these losers?
Did you teach her to smoke?
Uncle, she's the one who taught me
I'm not your uncle!
Can' you stop nagging for once?
Let's go
Give me a break
Watch the road!
If my kidneys don't kill me she will!
Yelling won't help, talk to her
Why smokers are so stupid?
Cigarette stinks!
It doesn't make sense
What about drugs?
Why do people... do drugs?
I don't know and I don't want to know
We're just businessmen!
It's simply market supply and demand
Smoking causes cancer
but there will always be smokers
At least I don't advertise
It's not me who got them started!
They bring it on themselves
They made their own choice!
Why? Do you know any addicts?
No... I'm just curious
Let me tell you...
Junkies can be the best actors!
When they crave a hit...
They'll do anything, say anything!
Don't ever hang out with that bunch
Or they'll make you feel like...
you're the one causing their mishaps
They bring it on themselves
If they say no,
there is nothing we can do
- Why so worked up?
- I'm not!
It's their own fault!
Do I look worked up?! Bullshit
Hello?
No. don't... I'll find someone... Bye!
What is it?
Chef's older helper is in the hospital
Find a trustworthy runner to do
the pick-up tomorrow
Forget it, I'll do it
Alright
Let's cut it with...
...rat poison someday
...and kill those scumbags
May, find anything?
The 9th floor looks suspicious:
the windows are covered
Maybe our purchase was too small for them
C'mon! We asked for 40 sets!
Call them again
Tell them to make the delivery now,
or the deal is off
What a pain in the ass
We must find the warehouse today!
Ask upstairs what's going on
9th floor, come in please!
Not a thing
Got any sand on your sole?
I'm clean, open up
My older helper had diarrhea,
he could barely walk
Take a seat, it's almost ready
Hurry up!
Take your time
Where's the washroom?
Something's up!
Easy, we're only taking pictures today
Something looks odd,
a strip of toilet paper
is hanging out of 8C
8C? Are you sure it's not 9C?
Keep an eye on both units!
A man in his 30s has just left Unit 8C...
...in brown shirt, khaki pants,
and holding a brown paper bag
Chief, isn't his bag a little small
for a delivery?
Small orders are common nowadays
That's how bootleggers takeover the market
Well?
Pull him over! It won't hurt!
Sing and Nam, check the guy out
Customs Department!
Hey, you! Stop there!
Don't move!
What's happening?
We've got some sets of aka porno movie
Is that all?
Get him to show us the warehouse
I mean No. 4 Heroin
How much stock
and how many people are there?!
Answer me!
Spit it out!
You scumbag...
Go on!
Let's see you try that again...
Don't you dare!
Stop it...
I work...
undercover for the Narcotics Bureau
Our operation has been ongoing for years
You'll ruin everything...
if you make a bust now
My supervisor is Miu Chi-Wah
I can give you his number...
you can ask him!
Just tell me if 8C is a lab or a depot?!
- Answer me!
- Chief...
Chief...
If he can name Miu Chi-Wah,
he may be telling the truth
You believe him?
Drug dealers are the slyest!
We might tip them off by calling!
What if he's not lying?
Come to your senses!
We'll take him for a liar just the same!
Why should the Narcotics Bureau...
take all the credit anyway?
Beat him!
Break him till he talks!
Spit it out!
You heard the Chief!
Let me handle it!
Ready to talk now!
I warn you, don't play games with me!
Help me on this once
If I made a mistake,
I'll make it up to you, big time!
Okay?
Okay?
Okay
Okay
You forgot something?
It's a bust!
Asshole!
It's the Customs!
Come help quickly!
Open up!
Forget it! Step aside!
Step aside!
Break it down!
Break the lock!
Move!
Something's happening!
Chief, they're flushing the stuff
down the sink!
You better hurry!
Someone jumped the queue!
Call Miu now!
It won't work! Let me pry it open!
They're dumping the smack
out of the window!
Give it to me!
Hurry!
The less they find,
the shorter the sentence!
There are two more trays! Go get them!
What about... the US Dollars?
Get everything, you idiot!
Stray bullet! Take cover! Move him aside!
Stop bustle!
Calm down!
Uncle!
They'll break the door soon!
They are coming in!
Just jump!
Don't look down! Look at me!
Jump!
- Hang on...
- Don't let go...
Hurry! Over here!
Don't look down!
Don't step on my hand!
Grab my hand...!
There was gunfire upstairs!
Are you okay?!
I'm okay
Did you identify yourself?
I did
But they went crazy when they saw the drugs
What happened to the one who fell?
He died
Customs agreed not to do
a composite drawing of you
You'll have to think of a story
I'm afraid Quin will be suspicious
Do some damage control for me
Sure
Let's go
See a doctor first
What a mess...
Following a tip-off, HKCED raided...
...the Chong Fei Industrial Building today
...and found No. 4 Heroin
on the 8th floor
...with an estimated street value
of HK$47M
...Hong Kong's 2nd largest
drug seizure to date
The following amateur footage shows that...
...a large quantity of drugs
thrown out a window during the raid
3 workers from the drug lab...
...attempted escape through the window
...resulting one death from falling
Sources suggest that...
...the deceased was allegedly
a Customs informant
HKCED, however, refused to comment
See this? You've got a rat!
How can you not know?!
Who?
The one in the morgue!
Your helper!
The paper announced that
he was a customs informant!
Is that your big problem or not?
You tell me!
But they're my nephews...
So what? They couldn't sell you out?
Even brothers could kill
each other for money
You fool!
So?
If not them! It must be me then?
Am I the rat?!
Or he is?!
Or you...?!
Is it you?
It can't be Nick
He saved my life
So what?
He could still be the rat for all you know?
Where is the other kid?
Can't find him
Keep looking!
He would definitely lay low
after the news all out!
I don't care!
Just find him!
I want him dead!
