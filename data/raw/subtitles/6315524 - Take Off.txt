Sit over theremyes...
Don't you read the papers?
Huh?
The papers?
This is all a front to trap people.
It's no place for people to live!
Ever heard of missiles?
The kids there play cricket with missiles!
You go to sleep and God knows
whether you will wake up!
If you know all this, why are you going?
Not me, my wife...
Over there!
Next!
Go on.
Yes. Please sit.
Sorry, Ms.Sameera. We cannot proceed your
application without an experience certificate.
Next, please!
Here, hold this!
I am sure it wasn't missed out...
just look again
I put it all together
I said a thousand times
that all papers should be in order.
Have a copy? If not, the application
will be rejected for sure!
How can they reject an application
just because a certificate is missing?
I will give you my hospital id...
tell them to call and check.
No point yelling at me!
We can't do anything
unless the verification is ok.
Or you call up the hospital and
ask them to mail the certificates.
We can try next time, brother!
No Sir... four of us
got our certificates together.
Mine alone can't go missing.
But if you ask me now...
Please sir. If it gets rejected today,
I lose my chance.
It's difficult to issue
the certificate on a Sunday, Sameera.
Request them to wait.
If not, better luck next time. Sorry!
Sir.
Don't you have
your UAE experience certificate?
Show that and say
you will send the new one later. Ok?
Uppa, this is Shaheed - from our hospital.
Hmm.
These are just old photos.
There's nothing else.
It's there... check properly.
Ibru, can you please
stop playing and check?
How was your exam? Answered everything?
The questions were good.
Meaning you didn't know the answers, right?
This folder that says 'for print'?
Yes, that one! Open it!
Got it? Did you?
Yes, got it!
Twenty five.
Here.
Come on.
Sorry! This is ten years old.
We cannot accept this.
We need to see your present experience.
What do you mean? Experience is
experience even if it is ten years ago.
Quiet, Sameera! Come away.
Sameera: But they say...
Jincy: If you start arguing
they will reject you right away!
But they are just rejecting it outright.
We understand it, Sir.
Actually we are a seven member group.
All working at the same hospital.
Kindly give her a chance. She will present
the current experience by next working day.
Please, Sir! It's her final chance.
Ok. For the time being I'll keep this.
But you'll have to mail me the new ones
to our Delhi office in three days time.
Sure Sir. We will! Trust us!
Ok. Passport, please!
We will need to go
in about six months, I guess.
God willing, we will all be
in the same place!
Shaheed has applied
only because you are going.
Can't you just say 'yes'?
This whole trip is to get over liabilities
I can't take up any more!
Then why can't you tell him that?
Don't keep him waiting.
Did I ask him to?
I don't want anyone to wait for me.
And Jincy, you better
stop acting the broker.
Good Lord!
You are on night duty this week too!
I will take care of that pervert!
What a nuisance!
Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven.
Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen.
Sixteen. Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen.
Twenty. Twenty One.
Twenty Two. Twenty Three.
Twenty Four. Twenty Five.
Twenty Six. Twenty Seven.
Rhythm is normal now? Check the BP too.
Ok, I will inform Sir. Ok.
You can move him to CCU.
- Yes, it is normal now. Ok! Move him!
- We have a section for reimbursements.
Doctor: Let them take a look. We...
Sam eera: What the hell is this?
Huh?
Am I the only one for night duty here?
There are too many patients in the
labour ward what am I to do?
We don't have many experienced nurses.
Well, I don't have
the kind of experience you mean.
So don't lose your sleep over that.
What are you saying 'I meant'?
We can't change the shifts
for one person's convenience.
And my divorce is your convenience?
Huh? What?
Don't force me to say more.
Why else would you put me
in the night shift four weeks in a row?
It's just six months more! After that
I will be done with the lot of you!
<font color="#804040">®</font><font color=#ff0000>Sud_Arun collections</font><font color="#804040">®</font>.
Aren't you on the night shift this week?
Why? Is Sameera on night shift as well?
You already know so why ask?
I will take the shift.
So I get to sleep this week too
Shaheed: Yes
Friend: You! Hold the umbrella up!
You think Iraq is the same as Fort Kochi?
Do you know how far it is? And alone!
If you can't do it,
let's call that boy next door.
If she got married and went off with
her husband it would be fine.
Uncle: But this is not like that!
Sameera: It is fixed now.
It wasn't our wish.
The circumstances are like that.
The salary is higher...
so she decided to go.
Selling a piece off the land just for
her sake will result in huge losses.
Even if you do get
a good price for the land...
for a divorced woman
to go abroad for two years...
you think the family is going to agree?
Careful!
These are from the bankmnot one... many!
And each has the details for payment.
If you pay these, we won't sell
the land and I won't go!
Problem solved!
Go inside, child!
We are not asking for charity, Uppa.
The property belongs to Um ma.
If we sell it, demand
goes down for Uncle's land.
All this love for family is
for that reason, isn't it?
Why are you standing here?
I will educate you as best as I can.
Get a job and save yourself!
Why do you keep calling me?
I told you I will pay
when the cash is ready.
First you get me the Visa.
Then I will pay the rest.
Ikka! Could you drop me today? Lam late!
Um ma is not happy about
your going to work.
Why are you talking like that?
You know the situation at my place
I told you all that before the wedding.
So what if you did?
Alright. I won't go.
You just give me half my pay every month
I will send it to Uppa
can you?
We have no urgent need for money.
You shouldn't neglect
your health at this stage.
Can you feel any movement yet?
It's not that I don't know
about the loan, Uppa.
How can I leave him and go to work?
I know your situation.
I just asked to see
if there was any way you could help.
Recognise them, Uppa?
Yes! Right?
Here. Give it to them.
What did you get for my birthday, Ummachi?
It's a surprise.
You can have it
when you come home for vacations.
But that will take so many days!
Why can't you come over, Um machi?
You know I work here. How can I come?
Ummachi?
Yes?
I am eight now, aren't I?
Yes you are! So?
I can come by myself to see you now!
Is there no one here?
Must have been an emergency.
She'll be right back.
If no one is around when the baby needs
medicine, fathers get upset!
All this fuss just because
she stepped out for five minutes?
The baby is crying!
What you do expect me to do?
Your wife is not the only
delivery patient here.
The ward is fully occupied.
Baby is crying.
Close the door and go to sleep.
I'll bring him back soon.
Please go to your room, Sir.
You shouldn't stand here.
Go on! Don't be so tensed!
<font color="#804040">®</font><font color=#ff0000>Sud_Arun collections</font><font color="#804040">®</font>.
Don't expect me to say thanks
I don't expect anything, ok?
I helped a friend who had to
make a call on duty time! That's all!
I was talking to my son, alright?
He turned eight today.
I can call him only at night.
He still thinks his mother
has gone away for work.
I am not telling you all this
to play on your sentiments.
It's so you will stop
hanging around to 'help'
At least you think
I hang around to help you
I will stop thinking
that if you want me to.
What do you even know, Shaheed?
What more is there to know?
This temper of yours is just a mask...
so people won't know
what you feel inside.
I did not invite you to the beach or
the park I invited you to my life.
I knew all about your problems
when I fell in love with you.
Sometimes love is like that. So...
don't ask me to change.
How could you apply for that job in Iraq
without asking me?
What am I supposed to say?
Ifelt like doing it and I did
lam past the age
when I need to ask for permission.
If I am a burden on you, just say so.
I will talk to Hasna.
Ya right! Just try going there to stay.
In two days she will bring you back!
Um ma wants to shift there.
What do you think?
Um-hmm Where are you off to?
Ironing.
He has decided to go.
Let him go, Um ma. I am here. So why worry?
The salary is four times what we get here!
That's the greatest relief!
True! With this I need to pay off my debts.
And get the house white washed.
And then if a guy comes along, willing to
pay me a dowry! Hail the Lord!
Sounds good!
Look! Our hospital is
near Saddam Hussein's palace!
Who is Saddam Hussein?
I talked to the family about your job.
So what if you are divorced? Everyone feels
you are young enough to get married again.
And what they say is true.
Among our people,
women don't go abroad all alone to work.
So forget about that job for now.
And I guess this won't be required anymore.
Let that property stay intact.
If I get married,
will that make everyone happy?
I have to go at any cost.
Whatever it takes.
Did you register for a job
back home to spite us?
What am Ito do?
I need to support my family.
How is that possible
with Ibru here, Sameera?
I will take him with me.
That's not for you alone to decide.
Shouldn't he be with his mother'?
He should be here. Here!
In this house.
Either the job. Or lbru.
It's for you to decide.
Any doubts?
Yes?
Sorry Doctor.
Could I talk to Shaheed for a minute?
Don't be late.
Ok Doctor.
What is it?
Hey! Sameera!
Have you changed your mind?
I didn't say so.
Can you marry me before we go?
If you were sincere about what you said...
talk to my father tomorrow itself.
Tell him we will be going to Iraq together.
Does it have to be tomorrow?
Is it ok if I go the day after?
<font color="#804040">®</font><font color=#ff0000>Sud_Arun collections</font><font color="#804040">®</font>.
You're my love.
You're breezing in my heart.
You wake up before my eyes.
You accompany me in my journey.
Divorcee and a child as well!
Is this what he was waiting for?
But the child is not with her.
So? Doesn't make it any less her child.
Don't imagine
this will happen with my permission.
So who is asking for permission?
All these years I lived for you.
Now let me live for myself.
You're the chillness in this heat.
You're the leaf in the tide.
You're my love.
You're breezing in my heart.
Like the forgotten chilness in summer.
Feel like the lost spring.
Hearing your voice in the breeze..
So what about this time?
He is to come over for vacation, right?
Just a minute, ck?
Ok.
Shouldn't we tell Ibru now?
You are the one who got married, not me.
Tell him yourself.
Our Iraq visa has come.
During lbru's vacation,
I will be over there.
Do you have to send him there?
It's a strange land.
That is none of my concern.
Wherever you are, I will send him there.
The rest is for you to deal with.
You really miss your son, don't you?
This year during school vacation...
he will be with us.
Would that be ok with you?
So what? He is our child!
When he comes...
who will you say I am?
<font color="#804040">®</font><font color=#ff0000>Sud_Arun collections</font><font color="#804040">®</font>.
Did you really check? Is it confirmed?
I checked twice. The result was the same.
Get me an appointment with Doctor Susan.
The doctor is in her room now.
Not many patients either. Just come over.
Not here. At her residence in the evening.
And please keep it a secret.
Have you told Shaheed?
Twenty four days growth. Heart beat not
yet visible. What is the problem really?
Giving up this child
because it is your second marriage?
It's not that, Doctor
I have waited long for a chance
like this job in Iraq.
In this condition I may have to give it up.
And I can't afford that right now.
That is not the reason, Doctor.
She is trying to get rid of this child
for the sake of her elder one.
Why are you talking like that?
There isn't even a heart beat yet
I never said I don't want another child.
Just that we wait till Ibru leaves.
That's all!
She is 31 now.
If we abort now,
can you be sure she will conceive again?
You are a nurse. You should know
I can't give you that assurance!
In that case I will not
consent to an abortion.
Who is this lbru?
My first child. Ibrahim.
He still doesn't know we are divorced.
When he comes for vacation,
she will be at five months.
She is scared her baby bump will be visible by
then and she won't be able to convince him.
What else can I do?
He already has doubts.
If he comes to know I am pregnant as well,
he won't be able to bear it.
I want both of you to think
about this and come back later
I have nothing more to think, Doctor.
Hey!
Where to?
Medical Center. I have the night shift.
After working the day shift?
Jincy is on leave.
It is her shift. Let's go.
Sameeraufiameera'.!
It is Dr. Sajeev's patient.
He has an ultrasound at 10.
Hey Sameera!
Good morning!
If his BP stablises,
the doctor said he can be discharged.
Come! Let's go.
Ok.
Don't mess up like last time.
Dr. Sajeev, ok?
Ok. Killing yourself making
overtime, aren't you? Way to go!
He called me last night
I wanted to come right then.
But I couldn't get a cab.
You shouldn't work nights anymore.
You need to be really careful
the first three months.
It's a good thing! I am happy for you.
Does she really need to go abroad now?
How can she not go?
Her visa has come.
Just get that cancelled.
It's come this far.
And we have already paid two lakhs.
They will not return that.
So what? Money is not everything.
Sameera: Um ma!
Mother: Child! My child!
Did you have any medicine?
You are a nurse!
You should know
not to take pills in this condition!
You are lucky the baby is safe!
After you left...
Shaheed had come to see me.
His only concern is your health.
Those tablets you take everyday...
if you depend on those for sleep...
it will lead you to depression!
When there is a life growing inside you,
you should forget all that.
You will learn to sleep without tablets.
It is you who needs this baby right now.
Whatever you do, don't forget that!
You can see her now.
Don't strain her too much.
What is all this?
Is it the job you are worried about?
We are nurses.
We are in hospital full time!
You want to work till your ninth month?
Go ahead! No one will stop you!
When the pain starts, you can go straight
into the labour room. Ok?
Who has it better than that?
Now about Ibru...
why are you so scared of him?
He is your child!
Our child!
Let him come.
This baby on the way...
he will accept as his brother or sister.
I am sure of that!
Shaheed? Hi! Yousuf!
Salam.
Soumya! Get up!
What is it, sister?
Please!
Get into the car!
Come on!
Faster, faster.
Don't delay! Move!
Get in the car. Don't be obstinate!
Get in.
Faster, faster.
Come on.
Move! Faster!
Come on.
Let's go. All fine
<font color="#804040">®</font><font color=#ff0000>Sud_Arun collections</font><font color="#804040">®</font>.
Good Lord! Are they going to kill us?
Quiet!
Don't worry.
You all are working for Iraqi Government.
The Army is for your protection.
This country is safe.
Not like what you hear outside.
Dear Sisters!
We are approaching a check point.
Please cover your heads.
Iraq is a Muslim country.
Go on.
Put the shawl on. Like this!
Look here.
Passport please
Shaheed: Passport sameera: Ok.
Here. I need to use the bathroom
Shaheed!
There is an emergency situation
I need your help.
So you...
Give me your passport!
What for?
They are asking for it!
I will hand it over. Be quick.
We will hand over our group's together.
You stay away.
Sister. We are all together.
Why are you talking about groups?
I was just trying to help.
We don't need your help.
All ok? No bags missing?
Give me that passport.
Can you ask about the SIM cards?
We just got here! Can't your Whatsapp
and Facebook wait till we get settled?
Alright! Alright!
They have a request.
There's been an accident
and they are short of staff.
They are asking if we can help out.
Wow! Great start!
We just got here after a ten hourjourney.
How can they ask us that?
She is right! I am going to my room.
We'll be ready in an hour.
Quick! Hurry along with that.
Come.
Quickly! Come fast! Change his dressings.
Hey! Please don't do it like that!
Go and put on your glovesmgo!
Please come.
Is this how you learned to do your job?
Can't you see that kid is in deep pain?
Don't try to be over smart
I know my job
I'll handle it.
This was no accident.
These injuries are from an explosion.
You were the one in a hurry to come here.
There's a reason
they are paying us more salary.
But don't get worried.
You heard what the manager said.
We are all working for Iraqi Government.
So why should we be scared?
Are you husband and wife?
Yes. I am Shaheed
and this is my wife Sameera
I am... Doctor Tariq.
Sir.
You both did a very good job today.
The staff here are very careless
I think you should raise the standard here.
Sure, Sir! Thank you!
Doctor: Ok. I will see you later!
My wife and I came here last June...
from Libya.
Even there...
lndian nurses get good respect.
You people consider this to be a service...
not just a job.
But here...
mpatients have increased
by thirty percent from last year.
The situation is getting very dangerous.
Tell me Shaheed...
why did you choose Iraq?
First thing is money, Doctor.
Second is your respect for our work.
Why is that so? Why not your own country?
In our country,
people don't say good for our work.
Wear it, please. You are a Muslim.
They will question you.
Doctor. Tikrit Teaching Hospital.
Your Id! Just to make sure.
Your id!
Ok.
Yazidi Doctor!
Get out of the car.
New!
Get out of the car. Fast!
Move! Fast!
April, May, June...
Ibru will come in three months, won't he?
What will we do about your tummy?
<font color="#804040">®</font><font color=#ff0000>Sud_Arun collections</font><font color="#804040">®</font>.
Upon a blade of grass,
a dew drop, a dew drop.
And like a dew drop, a smile, your smile.
May it not drop and disappear.
May it not vanish.
May you not fade away.
Upon a blade of grass,
a dew drop, a dew drop.
And like a dew drop, a smile, your smile.
May it not drop and disappear.
May it not vanish.
May you not fade away.
With love, I hold upon my hand.
This thought that burns me
up in this sandy desert.
As we traverse many paths...
Softly... softly...
May you not be dispered with the wind.
Or be shaken by a sigh.
Dearest dream of my heart...
My ache... my nectar...
Purest dew, may you not vanish.
May you not fall into the wastelands.
Be not seen by the sky.
Speak not to anyone!
Purest dew, may you not vanish.
May you not fall into the wastelands.
Be not seen by the sky.
Speak not to anyone!
Love at its best.
Upon a twilight in the sandy wilderness...
On a lonely night as the sea breeze blew...
A boat of dreams sailed silently, afar...
The shore beckons...
like the chime of an anklet...
To come together... closer... closer...
For two mindsto rise in bliss...
For another golden dawn...
when we rise up as butterflies...
To merge... to swaymto burn...
Purest dew, may you not vanish.
May you not fall into the wastelands.
Be not seen by the sky.
Speak not to anyone!
Purest dew, may you not vanish.
May you not fall into the wastelands.
Be not seen by the sky.
Speak not to anyone!
My return flight is in three hours.
If you are not in a hurry, I need to talk.
Would that be a bother'?
No
<font color="#804040">®</font><font color=#ff0000>Sud_Arun collections</font><font color="#804040">®</font>.
You know the pin number, right?
Lbru: Yes.
Don't worry.
He can manage on his own now.
How's the new life?
You're happy?
Now that you have a new job and family...
you can take a decision about Ibru.
When you told me not to bring him here...
it's not that I didn't understand.
I had no choice.
It's not like before.
Business is dull.
I am unable to even pay the salaries.
In this situation...
to take care of Ibru...
is getting difficult for me.
You always wanted to have him with you.
He will be with you from now on.
Not just for vacations. Always.
If you had taken that decision
you should have told me before.
I would have stayed back home somehow.
But now...
Everything changed in the last two months.
Nothing's in my control anymore.
I feel like my decisions were all wrong.
You were right.
You are the one Ibru needs.
He should grow up with you.
All his stuff is in heremalright?
Ok.
Ummachi! When are we going back home?
Hmm?
Aren't we going to visit Grandpa?
We will.
When?
Not now. Later.
Later when?
After two years.
Till then I have to work here.
But I have to go back to
Uppa when school opens.
You are going to join school here.
What? Uppa will be mad!
Uppa...
is not going to be with us anymore.
It's been like that since you were four.
I just didn't tell you.
From now on... you only have me.
OK?
It's ok if Uppa is not there...
you have me!
Here... this one too.
Yes, that's given
Jincy: What's this?
Yes, that's ok.
Look who is here!
Do you remember this Aunty?
Ibru! Come on here!
What? Have you forgotten us?
Grown so big! And where is
he off to with that big bag?
We are just off to the quarters to
freshen up Jincy: Sure. And you?
Alright. Say bye!
This is my friend, Shaheed Uncle.
Here!
Hey! Not now! When you get to the quarters!
Say thank you to Uncle!
Thank you.
Yes. He is asleep.
You're outside? I'll be right there.
He is on a visiting visa.
We need to get that changed.
Do you know what the formalities are?
We'll find out.
Let's ask Manager Yousuf.
Ok.
So much to do now!
And we need to find a school nearby.
One with a syllabus he can follow.
It's scary to think ahead!
Hmm.
It will all be fine.
Instead of two months, we will
have to keep up the drama forever.
He is not going back anyhow.
So then...
shouldn't he know about us?
If we tell him everything all at once...
Isn't it better if he figures
it out on his own?
Morning.
No! I said I don't want it!
I am going away!
Why is this Uncle always here?
I want to go to my father!
Your father left us...
I told you he is not coming back.
Did my father leave because of this Uncle?
Ibru... don't shout! Listen to me!
No! You lied to me!
You are the one who left Uppa
I don't want to be here!
I want to go to Uppa!
Mu'. Uppa is not going to be there anymore.
Move!
Ibru!
Ibru!
Ibru! Ibru stop!
Sameera: Son! Ibru!
Shaheed: Ibru!
Shaheed, phase'. Mu'.!
"Mu, son, phase stop'. Don": Run'.!
Ibru, stop!
Ibru!
Ibru! Ibru!
Ibru, son! I said stop!
Stop, Mu'.!
Ibru! Ibru stop!
Ibru!
Ibru!
Son!
“Ma, son, phase stop'.!
There is some reassuring news
coming in from Iran this morning.
War has started in Iraq.
The report says that
ISIS is involved and
civilians are also
attacked and murdered
Indians in Iraq are in scare
<font color="#804040">®</font><font color=#ff0000>Sud_Arun collections</font><font color="#804040">®</font>.
Keep an eye on him Daisy? I am on duty.
The casualy is full! Can't bear to watch!
They're shifting the
critical cases to Mosul.
And they are looking for
supporting staff to go along.
I am not going anywhere.
He has understood everything.
You tell me...
Haven't I been a good mother to him?
I have lived in fear for so long!
Of my father when I was young...
of Faizal after marriage...
and now him!
Shaheed is planning to go.
Go and talk to him. Tell him it is not safe
Ali! Please!
Are you sure you want to come?
It's going to take at least
two weeks to get back.
Yes Doctor
I'm ready.
OK then.
Hey! Why such a decision?
Why?
Shaheed...
There! Pass it to me.
Is it because of what Ibru said? Huh?
Is that it?
No. He is just a kid
I didn't take it seriously.
They why are you going? Huh?
Please stay! Let us tell him everything.
He will understand.
True.
He will understand. He should.
But he needs time.
When I am around, it will be
difficult for you to manage him.
If I stay away for a few days
he will calm down.
He will adjust to it all
I am sure!
And in all this,
don't forget about this one.
The army is with us.
So why be scared?
I will call once I get there.
Ummachi!
I don't want to go back to Uppa.
Will you send me back there?
The 2nd largest city in Iraq is now mostly
in the hands of fighters with ISIS.
The Iraqi soldiers had abandoned their
weapons
and fled the city of Mosul Militants
overrun the Western Bank of the City.
Being left in a similar kind of condition
we have to ask how..
How the Central Govt. Of Baghdad
is ever going to remipose its authority
in all places of this country.
The city of Kilkuk is
just 2 hrs east of Mosul
where ISIS has been launching
attacks on carnage forces.
It is next to..
Yousuf Sir!
Yousuf Sir!

You said we work for your Government.
Please help me, Sir!
I need my husband back.
Yousuf Sir! I need my husband back.

Jincy: Sameera!
Sameera: I need my husband back, Sir!
Jincy: Sameera!
Sameera: Sir! Please help!
Sameera! Listen to me!
Shaheed went on their behalf!
How can they say this?
Do they have no responsibility?
I won't go anywhere till they find Shaheed.
Sameera! Get up!
- This is em harassing! We are staff here!
- I am not going anywhere till they find Shaheed.
You go on!
Sameera!
Sameera!
Sameera: Move! Yousuf: Please!
Please.
Move.
Yousuf Sir, you... Come!
Yousuf Sir! Please listen to me, Sir!
Sir, you said
we should trust your Government.
Sirl have no place to go
I need my husband back, Sir.
Sameera please try to understand.
Mosul is not with Iraq now.
The Government is helpless.
Where should I go, Sir'?
I need him back.
Where should I go?
Please!
Ok let me do one thing
I can take you to the Indian Embassy.
You plead with them
I am sure they will find your husband.
Ok. You have written
the phone number, right?
Yes.
Alright then. You may leave.
We will look into your case
and get back to you soon.
Sir, my husband...
had gone to work in Mosul.
For ten days he is missing.
Please find him!
Look Madam! We will find your husband.
But it is not easy.
Mosul is a war zone now.
Why won't you understand? You say it
is a war zone! Then find my husband!
Please help, Sir
I've been working here for a year
I have been running from pillar to post
I have been calling every five minutes.
- Sameera: You have Dr Tariq's number?
- Woman: I need my passport.
Officer: Yes, we have his number
Sameera: But I am telling you...
it's not in the file.
- Please don't worry. We will look into
the matter - The file... could you...
Please bring that file back Sir.
Yes Madam. Don't worry Madam.
- Can you Please ask for The file back?
- Please come with me.
- We will take care of it.
- I'll add my husband's number to the file.
Please come outside with me.
What do you want?
Sir I don't know who you are but...
I won't leave unless you tell me
my husband will be found.
Do you see these people?
They are all here with
problems just like you.
Many of their people are not alive anymore.
We are finding it difficult
to even get the bodies released.
In such a situation,
your husband is not our only priority.
I can't wait
till he dies for you to rescue him.
This is not India
that we can just go in and rescue people.
Do you know what is happening here?
A brutal civil war!
This office is working only for people like you
who refused to leave despite knowing this.
We had a Government Order
to close up and leave.
And yet we are all here
for the sake of the Indians here.
It's not like you can't
find jobs back home.
Why did you not leave?
You have any idea
how much we get paid back home?
Our families take loans
and borrow money to educate us.
We get jobs as you said.
But we can't even pay off the interests
on what we get.
This is not just about me.
This is the state of all nurses
who come to work in places like this.
We are called God's Angels.
People who call us
that don't know the plight of our homes.
We pray for the life...
of every dying patient before us.
I am sure Shaheed will come back
if possible, please look for him
I have no one else to ask.
Justmalrig ht?
It's nothing.
Can you take me to Mosul?
Sorry Sameera. It's dangerous.
Let's go back.
Shuklaji, get me our sources in Mosul.
Yes sir
<font color="#804040">®</font><font color=#ff0000>Sud_Arun collections</font><font color="#804040">®</font>.
We want you to treat them.
They are dying! Make it fast!
I can't do it!
I will never treat a terrorist!
Do as I say! Or you all die!
Doctor please!
This is not the time to argue.
No I can't.
Those who kill and stand for killing
are not true followers of Islam.
You should treat them!
No!
- You are a doctor! You have to treat them!
- No! Get lost!
- Do it! Shaheed: Doctor! Please!
- No! Get lost!
You better do it!
No!
- I said you have to treat them!
- Doctor, Please.
Doctor?
Doctor?
Doctor? Are you a doctor'?
Who among you is a doctor'?
Id! Id!
Nurse!
Nurse!
Nurse!
Sister. She is my sist...
Come on! Move!
Move fast!
Move! Come on!
Faster! Move!
Faster.
Come on! Move!
Move on! Faster!
Come on! Get inside!
Let me! No I will bring it.
There's one thing you need to know.
She is from the Yazidi community.
Here, Yazidi women are considered slaves.
That's why I married her.
She is very fearless.
Move!
Abdullah! Over there!
Come on, move!
Straight on! Move!
Move! Move!
Straight! Move!
Come on, move!
Move on! Inside!
Move!
Inside! Go!
Inside! Move on!
Inside! Inside!
Straight ahead!
Move on straight.
Move on, move on!
Move fast!
Move on inside!
Move up! Up!
This way! Come on!
Inside! Go!
They have turned the hospital into a camp.
There are no Iraqis here now. Just us.
Ibru?
Where is Ibru?
Ibru! Where is he?
Son! Ibru!
Ibru! Come!
What happened?
Come.
Ummachi!
Huh?
Will the baby be ok?
Nothing... Nothing will happen, ok?
Look at this patient.
Check him! Take care of him!
Ummfl.
Ummfl.
Hello Sir.
They had all come here
for construction work.
For them to return,
money is not the only issue.
They don't even have their passports
<font color="#804040">®</font><font color=#ff0000>Sud_Arun collections</font><font color="#804040">®</font>.
She picked up a shell.
Thought it was a toy.
What could be done? It burst!
Shuklaji.
Yes Sir?
I want all of them out of here, ASAP.
But Sir, their passports?
How can we confirm they are all Indians?
I don't care about their documents!
In two days I wan't to send them
back to India! Is that clear'?
Yes.
Sir we found a Nurse who's escaped
from Mosul Teaching Hospital. Here.
He's the one. He's terrifed, poor soul!
Good Lord!
We will never be able to get out of here!
There's no one on the roads.
Look! See that car?
Couldn't we leave that way?
It's on the other side of the road.
It's not on the other side, Ancy.
It's this side.
And that vehicle belongs to those guys!
Stop saying nonsense!
Why don't you take a closer look?
If I die in this place,
don't marry someone else!
Remem ber me all your life!
I told you everything
about the situation here...
so why are all of you...
Hello?
Sam eera, it'sManoj. Indian Ambassador.
Are you all well?
Yes Sir. Any information about Shaheed?
We have almost managed to locate him.
He is in the rebel's camp.
We are planning a rescue.
The hospital is now
full of their people, Sir.
There are no Iraqis here now. Just us.
Don't be scared.
The hospital is in a no-fire zone.
The army will never open fire
in that direction
Manoj: That is why the rebels
have camped there Sameera: Hmm.
How many of you are there?
We are... Twenty four.
Four of those are Bangladeshis.
Umma! Umma!
Is 'Umma' a name to be called out
only when you are dying?
On whose behalf is this struggle?
You forget your own country
to fight for them...
and what do you gain?
Recites a prayer.
I want to live!
The Islam I grew up in
does not ask anyone to kill people.
And when it comes to living...
you don't have much time left.
I don't want to die
I want to live..
Injured: Want to live...
I want to go home...
see my Umma...
First thing is for the
bullet to be removed.
But I...
can't do it.
You need a doctor.
And there is a doctor here.
Where?
Where?
<font color="#804040">®</font><font color=#ff0000>Sud_Arun collections</font><font color="#804040">®</font>.
Don't worry. The rebels are not here now.
All of you come out with your passports. We
are here for your rescue.
Let's.
Hello?
Sir. It's Sameera.
A rescue vehicle from the Red Cross is here
What should we do?
We have no information on that.
Don't leave unless it is really safe.
Where are they saying they will take you?
I don't know. People have started
moving out from the other blocks.
Ok. Let me check
Manoj Sir says
we can leave if it looks safe.
You leave if you want, Sameera...
we are not coming.
It's four months since we got paid!
How can we just leave?
We should get paid for the work we did!
Can't you see what is going on outside?
At this time
we need to try and save our lives!
You are saying that because
you can't reach Shaheed unless you leave.
That's not the case with the rest of us.
We are not going anywhere
without getting our salary.
Sir. They are going to be
taken to Kurdistan
Manoj: Is it safe?
Shukla: No Sir.
That route is too danerous.
It's a war zone.
Why won't you understand?
In a week there will be no food left.
How will we live then?
The Government here
will be least bothered about us.
Why are you being so obstinate?
What can I tell a father who says
don't come home unless you have money.
When we get back everyone will be relieved
for a day that we are still alive.
After that it will be fights about money.
How can I go back to a house like that?
Sir. These areas marked in red
will be very difficult to cross.
Let's drop it, Shuklaji.
What do you think? You want to brief Delhi?
Sir. If we could just talk
to the Foreign Secretary...
We should be sticking together
at a time like this.
If we don't, none of us will get anything.
What is left here now?
Please try to understand!
We all need to get back alive.
You have to come!
Alright?
Yes Manoj? Why the late night call?
Sir, it's regarding
those stranded nurses in Tikrit.
A Red Cross vehicle is waiting to
shift them. What should we do?
You take your decision, Manoj!
I don't want to intervene.
It's your division.
Ok?
No Indian passports. I am sorry
Indians are not permitted.
Kindly contact your embassy, please.
We are Bangladeshi.
Come!
Let me try and call them.
Sorry Sameera
I don't feel that route is safe.
I need to see your passport.
Please come on
19 Nurses stranded in a war zone in Iraq
live in the shadow of fear.
Families back home anxious...
about nurses trapped
before the rebels' guns.
Though State and Central Governments
as well as the Embassy is involved...
local sources say
there is no means of escape.
Let us speak to Indian Am bassador
Manoj Abraham, a Malayalee.
See. The rescue destination
of the Red Cross is Kurdistan.
But on the way
they will need to cross several war zones
I did not think that was safe at all.
The hospital in Tikritwherethe 19 nurses
are now is in the army's no-fire zone.
So, they're safe.
So the families need not be scared.
A rescue by the Indian Government
will be 100% safe.
That's what we are waiting for
Shaheed is in the next block, Umma.
He cannot be contacted by phone.
There is nothing to worry about.
Hope there nothing wrong with your health.
No, Um ma
I am alright.
Once I get through
to Shaheed, I will call you.
Prayer continues.
Don't try to escape from here!
You are all under control
of the Islamic State.
Come on, every one of you
hand over your mobiles.
Mobile! Quick!
Mobile! Give the mobile! Quick!
Give the mobile! Quick!
Give the mobile!
Give the mobile! Don't use your mobile!
Everyone give us your mobile.
Give mobile! Mobile!
Come on, you! Give me the mobile!
Give me the mobile! Quickly!
Give the mobile!
Come on!
Come here! Where is your mobile?
Move! Move from here! Move!
You! Where is your mobile?
Where is your mobile?
Give it to us!
You! Where is your mobile?
Come here! Where is your phone?
Come on! Come outside!
Come out!
Who is inside?
Come out!
Who is inside? Come out!
Come on! Who is inside?
Who is inside?
Come on!
Come outside! Come outside!
Does Islam ask you to insult women?
I am a Muslim.
So is the scared woman inside
I will get the mobile from her.
Open the door, dear. It's Sameera.
Give me that phone.
Open, dear.
Lady Officer: Morning Sir
Foreign Secretary: Hmm
<font color="#804040">®</font><font color=#ff0000>Sud_Arun collections</font><font color="#804040">®</font>.
Morning, Sir.
Who do you think you are?
The Red Cross option was a golden chance!
You bloody missed it!
You told me to do what I felt was right
I did not feel
the Red Cross option was safe.
Sir, how was your flight?
Forget the flight, Shukla.
Then why did you talk to the media?
Don't you know some matters
need to be confidential?
The MEA has a spokesman.
He should be doing the talking.
Sorry Sir
I spoke only
for the sake of the nurses' families.
If a wrong information is given out,
they will panic.
What else should I have done?
So you're trying to say...
I will be giving
wrong information to the press.
Hello.
What?
When?
Switch it on. Switch it on!
There!
I'll check and call back.
A Red Cross vehicle which started
from Tikrit was burned half way to Kirkut.
Several Bangladeshi and
Pakistani nationals were on board.
It was the Indian Ambassador's
timely decision to stay back...
which saved nineteen
of the Indian nurses
who are still stranded
inside the Tikrit teaching hospital.
Sir, there's a call from Delhi.
Put it through. I'll take it here.
OK, Sir.
Good Morning, MrManoj.
Madam will be joining now.
And the call will be
patched to the Kerala MP.
Yes, Sir.
Thank you, Manoj! You did the right thing.
Hope all our nurses are fine.
Hopefully Madam.
But now they are restricted
from using mobile phones.
Which means the communication
part will be difficult.
So what's the plan?
First we are planning
to give them a satellite phone.
How is that possible?
U.N. is giving them food, madam.
We're planting satellite
phones in one of the boxes.
Good! So its time for the rescue?
Sorry to intervene, Madam.
This is Rajan, your foreign secretary.
Morning, Raflan'. Go ahead.
Madam, I think we should go ahead
with the military operation.
Our relations with Iraq are good
Manoj, what are the chances?
It's highly dangerous, Madam.
The chances are not good
Manoj, this is the MP.
Give us a solution.
Don't push them into more risk.
Sir, transporting is
a greater risk than saving them.
The area is under continuous shelling.
So an airlift is not possible.
The only exit route is Erbil airport
And that is 300 kilometres away.
Even the Red Cross vehicles
don't go beyond fifty kilometers.
So you mean they have to stay there
till the crisis is over?
Do we have a better plan?
No, Madam.
The entire world is
watching from the outside.
And here we are...
Have it!
Liqour in a prohibited area
I brought it in with great difficulty.
That too in my official bag.
To rescuemand peace!
So how is Mrs Tina Manoj...
doing in Delhi?
She needs a rescue first...
from me!
Then will come peace.
I can't plan two rescues
at the sametime, Sir.
You are young, Manoj.
The Government needs your service.
But they won't promise you a family.
Don't let that be destroyed.
Right now there is only one path before me.
And that is the path
to the airport to save the nurses.
It's impossible, Manoj.
No one has come back alive
from this group's custody.
We can only be spectators here.
They won't survive.
Come on! Go to that side!
Foreign Ministry says they're safe
and they're trying to keep in touch.
Amrita Tripati with the Top Story.
The anxiety over Indians caught in
conflict zone grows by the day.
Many express their anger over the
Indian Embassy and Government.
But for how long are they safe?
At present, they're all safe.
We want to bring them back to India.
That is our main concern.
Sir, from Tikrit to Mosul
the route is under the rebels' control.
On this route we need to make
the rebels themselves transport the nurses.
Make your point clear Manoj,
I am not getting you.
We should ask the Iraqi military to stop
treating the hospital as a no-fire zone.
And the rebels will know that very soon.
Won't that make it more dangerous?
No Sir. As far as I understand
they are using the nurses as a shield.
They need the nurses for their safety
if everything falls in place, the rebels will
shift the nurses to their base camp in Mosul.
Why Mosul?
Their commanding leaders are all at Mosul.
No communication is possible
till they reach there.
But we all know they won't negotiate.
They won't negotiate with India
but they will listen to their suppliers...
the group...
The rebels get their main funding
from them. They can help us.
But how is that possible?
Should India beg before them?
Sir we can deal with them unofficially.
We have people for that.
Crescent Group Chairman Jayamohan.
He is the right person.
Let him do the talking
Manoj, you've got 24 hours.
Dont fuck up!
The whole country is watching us.
They don't know any of this
<font color="#804040">®</font><font color=#ff0000>Sud_Arun collections</font><font color="#804040">®</font>.
Excuse me, Sir. Iraqi Ambassador
Mr.Manoj wants to speak to you.
Give us a minute, gentlemen.
To think that those
19 nurses can be rescued...
with the help of the rebels is stupidity.
And that too in a place like Iraq.
It's close to suicide!
And even if there are people in Saudi...
who support them as you claim...
who would admit to that publicly?
Sir, for twenty days
those women have lived in fear of death...
faced all these
hardships to earn a living.
Do not forsake them.
Try and get them to Kuwait
I can arrange a private flight
I have no other options to offer
I am sorry.
Sir.
Sir, it's confirmed.
No hope on Sameera's husband
46 girls are stuck there.
Including my daughter from
Tuticorin of Tamilnadu.
"I humbly request and plead to both"
the State and Central Governments
to rescue her.
Tell me Manoj.
Who should Italkto?
Sir, Mohan Sir has agreed.
So what's next?
Who will lead for us there?
SameeraShaheed.
She is the only Muslim in the group.
And I think she is capable.
Are you sure?
Yes Sir. She has work experience
in the Middle East...
and is fluent in Arabic.
Also, to reach her husband
who went missing in Mosul...
she will do anything.
But unfortunately, he is no more.
In that case,
till the evacuation is complete...
Sameera should not know that.
If Sameera loses hope...
none of them will escape.
Its collateral damage.
Ok Sir
Manoj: First clear the hospital
from no-fire zone Shukla: Ok.
And there will be a test attack.
Ummfl.
Ummachi!
Hurry up! Hurry up! Everyone move quickly!
Hurry Huffy!
Move out! Hurry up all of you!
Move! Move! Move!
Don't stop! Move! Come on!
Hurry! Move out! Carry her!
Hurry up! Quickly you and you!
Move move! Move fast!
Hurry up! Don't be late!
Hurry up! Don't delay.
Hurry now! Don't be late!
Hurry up! Don't stop! Quick!
Hurry! Don't stop!
Hurry! Don't stop!
Enter from that side.
Hurry up the stairs!
Quickly! Everyone!
Hurrry! Everyone here!
Everyone! Quick quick!
Hurry hurry!
Here! Quick!
Don't make me angry!
Hurry! Don't be late!
\Come on quick! Quick!
Hurry up and sit down! No one stop!
Soumya! Dear!
Open your eyes, Sou mya. Sou mya!
Get up, Soumya.
Next is the UN food supply.
Hurry! You and him!
We are coming!
Quick! Take this!
Hurry! Take it inside!
You and him! Go inside! Quick!
Take it inside! Go!
Go inside!
Here! Drink!
Son! Here, have some water.
Eat the food and be ready.
We will be leaving for Mosul soon.
They said to eat and get ready.
They are shifting us to Mosul.
Sameera!
Manoj: Yes! Shukla: Yes! Yes!
Hello?
Sameera?
Sameera, are you all safe?
Yes, sir. We are in the basement.
Sir... Shaheed?
Shaheed is here. In a refugee camp.
Sameera, I need you all
to hang on for one more day.
Tomorrow you will have escaped from Iraq.
But Sir, they have asked us to get ready.
They are shifting us to Mosul.
Leaving with them is the only to get
out of there. Trust me, Sameera!
Tell them all to go along.
Tomorrow you will reach India...
safe!
And Sameera.
Do not try to call home from that phone
Manoj: They will be able to
track the number Sameera: Ok.
Ok?
Are you mad? Sending them with the
rebels would be outrageous.
Let's wait for a better option.
Minister Ji, they have already started.
If we abandon them now,
what will those poor nurses do?
They have no choice, Sir.
Hello Sir? They are ready to leave.
They are confident.
But we are not confident, Manoj.
Let's drop this.
The Minister personally called Jayamohan
and put a stop to it.
The nurses will be rescued by Iraqi Army.
But Sir, they are preparing
to leave on my word.
If the military intervenes at this stage,
they are going to be killed, I am sure.
Listen to me, Manoj.
If 19 Indians get killed in a military
operation, it shows the bravery of the nation.
On the other hand if 19 Indians...
get killed at the hands of the rebels,
it is national shame.
Tell them to stay back
I won't knowingly leave them to die
I am taking the responsibility.
No nonoManoj!
If the Minister asks,
tell him they already left.
Sir is on his way to attend a function.
Who is it, Salim?
Iraq Am bassador Manoj Abraham.
The Minister said no.
Then what is it with him?
Sorry Sir. I did not mean to bother you
while you are travelling.
Our stranded nurses in Iraq...
would like to talk to you.
When you get back from your trip...
I am not sure they will be alive.
Just five minutes.
They won't take more time than that.
Please! Con net me to them.
Sameera, lam going
to connect this call to someone.
A person I believe can save you.
He should hear your cries.
He should feel...
that you are holding on
to his hand for your lives.
That if he lets go, you will all die
<font color="#804040">®</font><font color=#ff0000>Sud_Arun collections</font><font color="#804040">®</font>
Salim! Fix me
an appointment with Sheikh Salman.
For today?
For right now.
Sameera, there are
several check points on your way.
Always cover your heads.
You are being taken
to the rebel's camp in Mosul.
That area has all their
extremely dangerous leaders.
To them, all of you are
Muslim women of faith.
If they find out there are non-Muslims
among You, no one may be able to escape.
They should have no suspicion.
You should teach everyone to pray.
No one should have
any religious symbols on them.
Before burning your documents...
be sure to tear them up.
If not, they can get information
even from the remains.
Are all of you present here?
Are all the nurses present here?
Come on out! Get the vehicle ready!
Get the vehicle ready.
All of you get ready.
All of you have your guns? Come on!
Get your guns! Get in position.
Check your am munition!
Hurry up! We are moving to another place.
Tikrit Teaching Hospital
has been destroyed completely.
As per reports by the Iraqi media...
And inside sources confirm that
some Indian nurses were stranded...
Sir they are safe.
They have moved from there.
Thank God! So what's next?
Jayamohan Sir's meeting. It has to have a
positive outcome by the time they reach Mosul.
They are using a road
that is being controlled by the rebels.
They will enter Mosul very soon.
Sir the meeting has started.
Come on! Hurry! Hurry!
Everyone in the bus, get down.
Come on! Move! Hurry!
Move!
Come on!
Everyone get down. Get down!
Come on, move!
Fast!
Move!
Quick!
Fast Fast!
You and you there! Come on!
You! Keep in line.
Come on! Move!
Move on fast.
ShuklaJi, we need to
go to the Erbil border.
Arrange a bus for the nurses immediately.
Done, Sir!
<font color="#804040">®</font><font color=#ff0000>Sud_Arun collections</font><font color="#804040">®</font>.
What were you doing in Iraq?
You had no business here.
Tell me, why did you come?
We are nurses. From India.
Passport... Passport... Verification Id.
Sir, twenty emergency certificates.
All clean but temporary.
They can use it only for this trip.
We don't have the passports.
They are with the sponsor.
Show me the passport!
Where are you from?
What about you?
Tell me your name.
Meeting's over
I think it was positive.
Thank you Salim, Thank you!
Shall we go?
Don't forget to join the prayers
every time the muezzin sounds.
They will always be watching you.
Are you all Muslims?
Yes we are all Muslims.
Then why don't they speak Arabic?
Do you read the Quran in your language?
Yes. In our language. Malayalam.
They are the same.
We've got you water.
Drink!
Take it and pass it to your friends.
Here! Take your phones.
Hello?
Hello Sir. It's Sameera.
They have returned our phones.
They will take us to the border soon.
We're almost there!
When you reach the border, I'll be there.
Sir, I need to talk to Shaheed
I am not able to reach his phone.
Hello?
Sir. Hello?
Sameera. We haven't found him yet.
But you said...
he was found.
Then why are you saying this now?
I had to say that so you would stay strong.
The place where Shaheed is
last said to have been...
no one there is alive anymore.
I am sorry!
Sir...
Ummachi?
What happened, Ummachi?
Ummachi!
Sameera! What's happened? Tell us!
Sameera!
Please don't cry! Tell us what happened?
- They are saying they don't have Shaheed.
- I am sure he's fine. We'll find him!
Please stay calm.
Nothing has happened to him.
It will all be fine! We came this far!
Don't cry!
Don't make Ibru cry too!
You can see them
now digging their own graves...
in the very place
where they were stationed.
Get down.
You came to see your husband.
Go to the detainee. Go!
Go forward! Move!
Go! Go ahead!
Let her go inside.
Stop!
Come on. Check fast!
Come on! Quick!
Ummachi!
Shaheed!
Sir!
Any Updates?
Did they reach?
No Sir. Still waiting.
Sir they're here.
Sir what is this?
The army snipers are aiming at the bus.
They will not get out.
Those are their procedures, Manoj.
It's not our country.
We can only request them.
Sir then please request! Or they will
not be able to get out of the bus.
Go and stand down! Copy that!
Thank you Sir

Without Sameera, this rescue
would not have been possible for India.
It was her urgency to reach Shaheed...
that was our weapon.
Hope gave her courage.
Otherwise...
we would have lost all 19 of the nurses.
We are nurses from India.
We work in Tikrit.
Now we are safe.
Now... now we are free...
Jayamohan Sir's role
in was crucial to the rescue.
The video taken by the militants
was the only proof.
What deal he struck with Salman Sheikh...
will forever remain
India's classified information.
Sir. Take Off confirmed!
Really we have to thank
the Indian Ambassadorm.
Ajayakumar Sir and the Government.
And then the ISIS people also.
They didn't harm us;
They allowed us to leave.
Without getting a salary for long,
how could...
we go home?
So many problems at a time like this!
We did not think we would
be able to return.
You don't hear much about
people taken by them ever returning.
So that's what we too expected...
that after being taken away by them...
we would never be able to
get back to our lives.
But nothing of the sort happened,
by God's Grace.
They were very fiery
in the way they spoke to us.
Its when we reached the Ground Floor
that we heard the noise.
Whether it was a gunshot
or a bomb blast...
we still don't know.
Such was the impact...
that glass shattered and
many had injuries on their heads...
many had their hands injured.
We never expected such a situation.
We were so affected by it that...
we wanted to leave at any cost,
even if it was with them.
That's why we boarded their bus and left
