Director Ryu, Seung Wan
November, Nineteen Japan, Hashima
Coal Mine, Korean Residing Area.
I apologize, to all of you for taking the
wages of sin that we adults have committed.
I hope you guys would survive
and grow up for Korea.
We'll be back for you Mr. Yoon!
Never mind an old man like me
but live well.
If we delay, it'll be
hard to make it out.
Let's get started!
Aren't you going
with us, brother?
If I go, who's gonna
protect Mr. Yoon?
Even the rain's helping
you guys to escape.
Time's Up! Let's go!
Go!
Be careful!
Even if one of you gets shot, never look
back! You'll gonna get killed also.
Till you make it, think of
you, yourself, your life only.
After you hide in a secret
place, take some rest
and then go to Nagasaki.
You could be captured in Nagasaki, so don't
lose your tension till you reach Korea.
Stay alive! Let's meet each
other in a better world!
Who's that? Don't move!
We're gonna shoot
you if you move!
You'll also be killed!
How long is it?
We're near!
Mr. Yamada! Shall
we take them out?
Nope. Just write "drowned"
in the report. We
got three! Special
payment will be given!
The Battleship Island.
You're not even going
to war young man.
Please smile, your
handsome face looks ugly.
It's not a moment
to laugh or smile.
Commandeering is
just commandeering.
Who says commandeering? Never
heard from the Inteligence
people? (INTELIGENT PEOPLE
= THIS GUY'S COLLEAGUE)
I do my best to
serve the country.
Then did you send your kid
to the commandeering?
My son has a tuberculosis!
If my son wasn't ill I
would have sent him also
to serve the country. Why
is the music so gloomy?
Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee!
Are you gonna play
this all night?
The music is too gloomy for
the ones going out there.
Can't we play something
exciting like jazz?
Why?
Never heard of "Jazz Prohibition
Order"? Wanna see me arrested?
My goodness! Who's
gonna arrest you?
We have here all the
high ranked officials.
Let's have some fun.
You wanna have fun that much?
I must be paid as
risk allowance.
I understand.
February 7, Nineteen Peninsula
Hotel, Myeong Dong.
Where's Lee, Kang Uk?
He's on stage.
Send him to me right now,
or he'll be imprisoned.
Why'll he get imprisoned?
This crazy lad had an affair with the
wife of a high ranked secretary!
Hey, let's go!
Are you out of your mind?
The secretary's wife
liked my music,
she asked for a dinner. How
am I supposed to say no?
And the Owner of Dong-Yang
kept on pushing me to meet her
I just had a meal with her.
If you get imprisoned, who's gonna
take care of that little one?
Why'll I get imprisoned?
You played with the secretary's
wife who directly works
with the Jap Government.
Thought you'd be alive?
And the "Jazz" you played today?
Have you prepared it?
Here.
Including you, there are 9
of you in the orchestra
and your daughter, which
makes 10 heads. Ten Heads!
Police station families & I get
nothing in our pockets.
I know I always owe
you much, Sukiyama.
Hey! I'm searching an office in a
Japanese factory for you and your family.
Explain this situation to your
family well, and get some more money.
You always wanted to
work in Japan, right?
I've heard that the Japs lost in
the Philippines. I think they'll
gonna lose this war. (비율빈-比律賓 ->
CHINESE LETTER OF THE PHILIPPINES)
That's a big blah blah blah.
Don't you read newspapers?
There're thousands of
American prisoners in Japan!
Before you meet Sakura,
Japan's gonna win the
war! Just trust me! (SAKURA
= JAP SPRING FLOWER,
(USUALLY APPEARS ON
MARCH) (BEFORE YOU MEET
SAKURA (REAL MEANING) =
Before spring comes)
Gonna see flowers?
February 12, 1945
Ship to Shimonoseki.
Finish it quickly!
You should have stayed
with your mommy at home.
Why did you join this ship?
Showing this piece of shit!
A man told me that I can make a
lot money through this work.
He sent me here directly. I
couldn't even inform my family.
I was send here the day after honeymoon.
Hey bro! Are you a new bridegroom?
I didn't really do anything properly,
I think I'll forget my fiancé's face!
What makes you here Mr. glasses?
I'm a student from
Seoul University.
Wow! What an intel. intel.
(INTEL. = INTELLIGENT PEOPLE)
This's a better way than
going to the battle, right?
I heard that we can earn
enough money to buy a house!
Well they say that, but you
see the little kids over
there? What are they gonna
do with those little ones?
When we get off this ship,
our destination's different
with the people here.
So be patient, alright?
You guys have personal money,
right? Hand it over, now!
This's our Golden Rope. (GOLDEN
ROPE MEANS KEY TO SUCCESS IN KOREA)
If we lose this, we're doomed.
So secure it properly, okay?
Papa, Where are we really going?
You'll know. How many times
are you asking? Stay there!
Now it's safe.
Fighting?
That's Choi, Chil Sung? Jong-Ro
Gangster Choi, Chil Sung?
Yeah~ What a typical Korean~~~ Can't
stop fighting for a single moment?
Stop it! Be Quiet!
One more noise will be treated
as rebellion! We will shoot you!
Fuck! What on the hell's
that motherfucker saying?
Hey You!
Is there anyone who
can speak Jap?
One more noise, they won't
use water, but bullets.
So stop making this piece
of shit, and be quite!
What a dirty mouth! You've
got a mop in your mouth?
Or is your under part
dirty like your mouth?
You ever seen my under part? Do you
even know if it's clean or dirty?
Seen it before?
You got no idea who
you're yelling at!
Sit Down!
You must be some
gangster shits in Seoul,
Why on the hell are you letting
your goddamn stress upon
Korean girls after being
slapped by some fucking Japs?
Wait!
Don't fight guys! Take it Easy!
Okay, I understand.
So let this go.
You guys also sit
down. I said sit!
I was about to let it go coz
it's too small to grab.
Your mom's so pitiful coz she gave birth to
a person who doesn't even have real balls.
Oh My! He's done with his pee.
Don't make noise anywhere coz those
kinds always get into trouble.
Troublemakers are
always troublemakers.
Shimonoseki Harbour, Japan.
Passengers! The ship has
just arrived in Shimonoseki.
Japanese people will
move in a separate way.
So Hee! Listen up! If
you let this hand off,

You guys too. Secure
your instruments.
Tension up!
Hold this.
Hey, So Hee! So Hee!
Sorry sir! Excuse Me!

Stop saying shits. Do what

I totally have nothing.
How about this one?
Hey you guys,
Stop with all the Shits that Koreans
do. Don't even try to be a tick!
Sir! Sir! You're
a Korean, right?
Just a second! Just a second!
There must be a
misunderstanding here.
I'm here to meet
someone else here.
I'm not a man of commandeering.
This's a recommendation paper written by
Jong-Ro Police Station prosecutor Sukiyama.
And this's a certification of arts. I'm

This is a genuine watch named
"Rolex", from the western world.
I got it from an official in the
Japanese Government in Korea.
I'm pretty sure sir you
will do things very
well. I have a daughter
who came here with me.
Her name is Lee, So
Hee. She is so young.
Is it possible to know her
location? "Flower of Friend".
Can you perform it?
I guess the entertainers will have
the first place to settle down.
U & I are.
Flowers of Friend.
Same Navy School.
If you are a flower
in the field,
you're ready to fall.
You're ready to fall

HEY! WAIT!
Interesting, huh? You just
need to beat him up, isn't it?
Heard that new Korean Girls are in the
Red-light district. A bet for tickets?
A Red-light district?
That's Enough!
If we same Koreans fight each other,
then that's just what they want.
The more we fight, then they'll
have the power to control us.
You're saying that this piece
of shit's a same Korean?
What are you looking at?
You dumb little Koreans!
From now on, I'll be the Big
Boss of all Koreans here.
I'll lead them
properly! Support me!

"BIG BOSS" CHOI, CHIL SUNG!!!
(CLAP CLAP CLAP)
Everyone! Greet!
Beauties have come.
Let us all sit first!
Sit! Sit on your Seat. Quick!
This Way~.
You should be welcoming them a
lot! Why're you all so gloomy?
You're the essentials in
war, coz you serve the
people who're fighting
in the name of Japan.
Be Proud!
We once had top prostitutes
or movie actresses
coming from Japan, but we
have Koreans nowadays.
But, a pure thing like this
could also be a taste, right?
It's a welcoming party for new comers,
but it really feels depressed.
Turn on the record
that I brought.
Yes Sir!
To let the Korean girls to
release their tensions,
I prepared a Korean music that I
listen sometimes, it makes fun.
I have prepared the bed,
so you'd listen to music
and release your stress,
and sleep early tonight.
I sang this myself.
Hey! What are you doing?
Leave her alone!
Sister! Please tell them I sang
this. Pls. tell them I sang this.
Help me..
The girl's saying that she was
the one who sang that song.
Sister! I can sing dance and perform
a lot of things. please tell them please.
She said she can sing
dance and perform a lot.
What can she do more? What
can you do more, he says!
I used to do Orchestra in
Seoul. Lee Kang Uk Orchestra!
That girl and the father were
famous musicians in Korea.
I came here with
my dad and uncles.

July, 19452nd Base Camp
OSS Training Area of
Korean Independent Army
Dukok, Xian, China.
Is it fine to stay with
the American OSS troops?
I'm doing my best!
You've got higher grades
than the Americans.
The project that you're preparing to enter
Seoul. You'll be a bit upset but..
You'll not be joining.
Recently, we got some
news that the OSS had.
Last week, the US made a new bomb. They
say that the power's beyond imagination.
When it drops, it'll explode 200Km around.
They'll drop it in the center of Japan.
That's something not yet confirmed. What
important is that the USSR will join.
The US already ate Okinawa, and the USSR
will join. Japan can't stand anymore.
It's a moment for victory
in war not in battle. To
advance the independence,
we must gather force.
Yoon, Hak Chul! This person will
solve all the internal conflicts.
He used to be the manager of
finance of an organization,
but was captured by the
Japs and disappeared.
We thought he's executed
without judgement.
We got a message from the
US that he's recently
detained in a coal mine named
Hashima, near Nagasaki.
Bring Mr. Yoon here.
Gather!
If we make a single mistake,
we'll be in that mine again!
Let's do our best.
Just fucking smile!
If you guys disobey, I'll tell Big Boss
Chil Sung. So you'll be back in the mine.
Get Ready!
Hey! Why aren't you eating it?
Fresh egg tastes so fishy.
Just eat when you're
told! That's the best!
Some people can't even get
that thing! Eat it right now!
Abracadabra!
You've eaten much,
so go to work!
Rookies! Follow the
person in front.
Fuckers! They don't
even give proper foods!
A dynamite! What are you
gonna do with it? Silence!
The copper coming out from the bottom
tastes good. This won't make me starving.
Won't it blow up
inside your stomach?
Me too.
I'm okay.
I spit black coz I've inhaled
too much coal dusts.
MR. YOON! ARE YOU
ALRIGHT? I'm okay.
Gas's leaking!
So What?
Block the gas hole and dip
up the water on the ground.
For The Great Japanese State,
leading the Holy War of East Asia!
We Hashima Coal
Mine's in the center!
For the Great Emperor &
Nation! For our Hashima.
Coal Mine and the
officials returning home!
Toast!
Help me.
What's this?
Explosion!
Get Out Quickly!
Don't Leave anyone
behind! Get Out Now!
Thank you very much!
Thank you very much!
How many times have 2nd
Mine got into trouble?
Should I have to care
about this also?
Where's the joining
section with the 3rd?
Not yet exploded, sir.
How much have you
got from the 2nd?
Recently, the lowest. It's even
down 1.1km. It's hard to continue.
WE MUST SAVE THE YOUNG
ONE! SAVE THEM ALL!
NO ONE MUST DIE! THE YOUNG ONE!
That mine's for Koreans, right?
To prevent further damage, explode
it in the middle and bury them all.
HEY YOU FUCKERS! WE
ARE STILL DOWN HERE!
THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE FUCKERS!
Sir! Yoon Hak Chul's in that
mine you ordered to explode!
Out of my way!
I TOLD YOU NOT TO PUT HIM
IN THE MINE! WHAT IF THE
KOREANS WILL REBEL AGAINST
US FOR HIS DEATH?!
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS!
YOON MUST LIVE!
They're all waiting for you!
Hey Song, Jong Gu! There's
a problem in the 2nd.
After working all night with not enough
sleep, What the hell am I doing here?
Isn't that the place we previously
blocked due to gas leak?
Shut Up! You should do your
duty when it's ordered.
Are you back in the
Labor Service?
Are you sure this connects to the
3rd? It's not my job to know!
What the fuck?
Let's blow it! What?
There's no other plan. Make some
wooden support and blow it.
Shut up!
We can't guarantee that the
gas here'll blow it up.
Hey! This's some piece
of dynamite I've got.
Hey! We can't do it anymore.
Gas leaks continuously.
What if it gets ignited?
Aren't you guys technicians?
Alright! Alright!
Getting inside!
Continue!
PULL!
The Koreans know the accident, but they'll
have no idea who's dead or alive.
I'll inform them that
all the Korean wounded
people' ll be sent to the
big hospital in Nagasaki,
and then I'll burn them
all in the crematoria.
Bringing Koreans
also have limits.
Even the war's in trouble,
you shouldn't make any
damages to the company's
property, should you?
I'll do my best to
prevent further noise.
And Mr. Chiva! When will
you visit our mine?
It's nothing special, but,
last time you recommended
us to the government
which made us rewarded.
I want to send a Korean little
girl as a small gift...
Yes.
You may expect a lot!
Where's Yoon Hak Chul?
He's alive! He's alive!
For today's accident,
The Head must show us the
exact rate of damage.
If The Head doesn't pay
back the damage properly
without solutions to
prevent re-accident,
I AIN'T GONNA HAVE PERSONAL MEETING
WITH MANAGER SHIMASAKI AT ALL!
THAT'S RIGHT!
THAT'S ENOUGH!
Wait! You lost your
position. From tomorrow,
your position's toilet,
taking care of shits!
Hey!
PLEASE SOMEONE TELL THIS SHIT
TO STOP! HE'S HITTING ME! HELP!
You should do as you're paid.
Should I drink myself
just watching you
around like a fool?
Stop! Stop it?
You're trained by the Americans.
But you're currently alone!
How on the earth are you gonna
get Mr. Yoon out of here?
After meeting Mr. Yoon, I'm
going to use the telegraph,
to call the Korean OSS
agents in the headquarters.
Through the Nego with the ship
coming to this island carrying foods,
we're gonna go to the
US Camp in Okinawa.
Can you prove that you're
not one of the Jap spies?
Member of Korean Independent Army,
Special Forces, OSS, right?
I was drafted as a school soldier in
the 65 Division, 7991 Camp in China.
Escaped from Seo Ju, lase
July. Joined the Independent.
Army this Feb. and met
General Lee, Beom Seok.
Is there any personal
messages that I must receive?
General Lee told me that
he'll serve your favorite
food, Pork and Cool Wine,
once you come back.
When do we start?
I'll send other girls.
Just sit.
Just sit.
I ain't here for love.
Why? The tattoo in the chest
suddenly makes you unhappy?
What the fuck..
You need some Korean to complain,
so you could release your stress.
I might die not by Japs,
but some mosquitoes.
Firstly, I was sent to China.
I had no idea. They said we'll earn money.
We took a boat ending in a Jap Camp.
What the fuck.. Mosquitoes
there are so sharp.
Mosquitoes even kill
people if they bite.
Once they bite, the body becomes a hell of
fire. Even though you drink water, no use!
A girl from Pyeong-Yang was rolled on
a nailed board due to fake-illness.
She was rolled left & right.
Eventually died in front of everyone.
I really did not want that torture, so
to finish it, I drank a dirty water.
Well, it didn't give quick death, but
the Jap Doctor saved me at once.
After that, an owner who is a Korean washed
me and sent me right away to the Japs.
Goddamn Motherfuckers.
The moment I was sold to
the army for sex slave
was done by a KOREAN!
When the army ran away,
I escaped. But the one
who captured me and sent
back was a KOREAN!
YOU'RE SAYING THAT I NEED A KOREAN
TO COMPLAIN? RELEASE STRESS?!
What a mess..
Kill your temper!
The proverbs say that one day,
your mother-in-law will die
earlier than you. (IN SOUTH
KOREA, THE WIVES GET TORTURED.
BY THEIR MOTHER-IN-LAW. (IT'S
A SORT OF ANALOGY) (TRUE
[MEANING -> THE JAPS WILL
BE FINISHED BEFORE WE DIE]
Fucking Cigar!
Give more effort! Wanna
make me in trouble?
All of them will get
horny with this.
It hurts a lot. No
one in the hospital?
I sent wealth, but why
do I receive poverty?
The salary for the
guards have decreased.
Aren't you the one taking all?
Brother! A cigar please.
You haven't paid last month.
They increased all the goddamn
insurances. Only you?
So better stop gambling.
No money? Then sleep!
Wait! You've gotta
pay it exactly.
Send this to Omuri
and bring 10 cigars.
Brother! The manager
wants to meet you.
So Hee!
Why? Why? my goodness.
It hurts.
You should've been careful.
Oh Odor~
I've been thinking this
for a long time...
we had an accident today,
so before it's too late
I want a proposal
with you Mr. Lee.
Yes, sir!
Your little girl, So Hee.
Mr. Chiva of the Head Office lost a
daughter like So Hee during the air strike.
This place is too
dangerous for So Hee.
In my opinion, why not send her to
Mr. Chiva as an adopted daughter?
Mr. Lee. We're in a war.
In the war, the Winner's Not A Survivor.
The Survivor Becomes The Winner.
The next coal ship' ll go to the Head.
I'll send So Hee with the Ship.
Let's do it.
Post office key?
I'll pay as much as you want. Fuck you!
You got no idea how much I would ask.
Here!
Advanced Payment!
WOW! EVEN ADVANCED PAYMENT?
I must know what's going on!
There's a mail to check.
I'm not going to be in a team
who never shows their cards.
If you wanna check some mail, better bribe
the Labor Service people. It's faster.
It's not like that. We
must use a telegraph.
A telegraph?
You know how to use it?
I only need the key.
This fucking rookie just show up and
says "I.WANNA.USE.THE.TELEGRAPH."
The so-called Korean Independent
Solider even bribes, huh?
What the hell is this?
Let's just cancel it.
I already know. How are you gonna
just cancel it, young man?
Want me to ask the Labor
Service about the issue?
MR. YOON HAK CHUL WILL
GO OUT OF THIS PLACE.
Hey man, Lee, Kang Uk!
Just get a key for us.
Decide. Now you know the plan. If
you won't cooperate, I'll kill you.
Hey Kang Uk! What's
going on down there?
Soon it'll be curfew.
Where were you?
I've been looking for you
the whole day. Inform Maeda
that the picture's done.
I'll hand it tomorrow.
Done already?
Draw for me also!
What are you doing here?
They're fighting over gambling. I
was in the middle of mediation.
YOU STUPID LITTLE KOREANS!
(SHAKE HANDS! BOTH OF YOU!)
I'm on it. Don't worry!
Come on. Let's go.
Thank You, sir!
No money needed,
but a condition.
When Mr. Yoon goes out, So Hee
& I will go out together.
This brother's.. Perhaps you're not
gonna make Mr. Yoon swim, aren't you?
You've got a plan, that's why you're
enlarging it using a telegraph, right?
KILL ME, OR YOU'LL BE KILLED BY THE LABOR
SERVICE, OR LET MY DAUGHTER & I OUT!
This time, you guys decide.
When things go wrong, I'm
gonna kill you first.
Attack!
Where on the fuck is this shit?
Change seats!
Hey man!
Where's the key maker?
Is he at the night
session? Where's he?
Not night session! He's
at the tool factory.
We was chosen
coz he handles metal
and steel good.
Ah Yeah! Tool Factory!
Thank you very much!
I wanna talk to the key maker.
What brings you here?
Need another chained box?
It's a very important key. I wanna
make it one more in case of lose.
May I see?
Actually, it's not
really my key.
I smell some shit...
Don't be selfish!
Which girl's key?
Your sense's like a....
The husband has the wife's key.
You know it well, don't you?
Here's the payment.
This one also.
Take of So Hee. Thanks!
What do you have?
Why's your face like that?
Hey.
I already informed your aunty,
so transfer to Aunty's room, so you could
come out, once I call you at night.
Can't you just tell the manager,
I wanna stay with my daughter?
Why? Did he say anything?
No, it's just that
I've got no friends.
Even sisters say that
the manager gives you
comfort. Why are you
pretending as if you're tired?
THOSE GODDAMN BITCHES!
So I told you! You should be good to
others. Haven't I said this before?
Why are you crying?
You know nothing about
the things that I do to
make your comfort, and you
only think of yourself?
Why are you always saying
"I only want you to live"?
Alright! Stop then.
What shall I say more?
Anyway, be prepared to come
out during night time.
That's the only way you
could stay with papa.
An interesting movie?
Yes. A Love Movie!
Thank you very much, sir!
Good Pictures for you, sir!
I've got 3 keys for you. You
remember the conditions, right?
Remember that there are eyes
here who are in my side.
Big Boss!
What is it? No, No, No I will
show you something good.
Why? Not working?
They're coming.
Successfully entered.
We're all prepared to go.
How many?
Yoon & Park Two only.
On the 2nd day 05:00am,
Possible To Enter By Ship.
Must Find Sailor
Dakagura. Be Safe, Over.
Korean People Mutual
Aid Benefit Association
I could see the complicated
situation of war.
When was the last time you used
this kind of well-made paper?
Fake paper money and war? What
relationship do they have?
The US still has a lot
of money to make these
fake paper money with
well-made papers.
The wealth, eventually, gets
the victory from war, right?
Hand over all the documents
of Korean, including me.
The island will be full of dirt
again with fake paper money.
That's a bomber, sir!
To all the people and officials,
were expecting American bombing,
so don't go out of your places.
Once Again! To all the people
and officials, we're expecting
American bombing, so don't
go out of your places.
Now's the time.
What made you so cheap?
A lot are after this, so
I wanna get rid of this.
Where's Omuri?
Let's Go!
THESE LITTLE BASTARDS...
Mr. Yoon!
It's time for medicine.
Mr. Yoon?
So Hee!
What is it?
Kang Uk? Come In!
Okay.
Where's So Hee?
Find her quickly!
After meeting So
Hee, I'll go inside.
When did you meet Park Mu Young?
Huh?
Mr. Yoon is missing.
I didn't have time
to say Good Bye.
Why's it like this?
Security was the most important
task. I couldn't speak of it all.
Before we take the ship, I got
a question for you, Mr. Yoon.
This document, containing
details for Korean people's
payment, was found in the
highly secured mail box.
All the incomes, after being
deducted for insurances,
didn't really go to the proper
account, but to an improper account.
All Koreans had their
contract in the name of Yoon.
Hak Chul. All the incomes
were in your account.
Among that, half of them went
to manager Shimasaki's account.
Did you know?
After I came here, I
noticed that the manager
and the Head officials
took the income away
my name and my account? They didn't
even inform the dead's to their family,
and took the whole indemnity.
Shimasaki that guy! I didn't
know he would use me like that!
When I observed the book, I saw a lot of
signatures and fingerprints of yours.
Who would have made that?
Haven't you thought of the
fact that Shimasaki made it?
The reason why escaping or
striking business failed,
I was thinking of it.
Set a Korean leader who can
control them. And use him wisely,
then it'll be easy
to control them.
You're handling a big money to fight
against Japan, but eventually caught.
Without any judge, how did
you end up here clearly?
Could you explain?
This is what Shimasaki wants.
You want me to
explain? You Idiot!
We Koreans knew that a
guy like you would come!
Declaration of Shift!
Without that, you must
have been in jail!
HEY PARK MU YOUNG!
You think people will follow
you after knowing this?
Why do you think Shimasaki accpeted the
nego of a person who protects Korean?
Nego, ha?
They even brought grade school
kids here and you took their money
and you call that Nego?
If you are for sure of my sin,
then now here
kill me for good.
This Motherfucker! You said you're
gonna go with us and now you betray!
I warned you! If you betray I'll
inform the JAPS! Stand Still!
Kang Uk! Listen to me! This guy is
a no one, but a spy fom the US!
If you report him, So Hee & you
could go out of this island.
The moment you go to the
manager, you're all dead!
What's the real purpose of you?
So Hee! If papa shouts, run
to the manager and report!
This guy and manager
Shimasaki is one.
THESE LITTLE BASTARDS
ARE REALLY......
SO WHEN IS THE BOAT COMING?
FATHER!
So Hee... It's alright!
Quiet.
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU
DOING WITH MY KID?
Let her GO!
Unarm yourself first! Mr.
Yoon! Are you alright?
I'm fine!
Go and help your friends!
Park fooled us all!
Unarm yourself PARK!
Friends are coming!
Stop being a fool! Read This!
Till what point are
you gonna trick us?
SHUT UP! YOU BASTARD!
I'm here for a piece
of shit like you,
Don't you feel pity
upon the Koreans?
ITO DAKAMICHI named
as YOON HAK CHUL!!!
Due to your act of betrayal, I complaint
you to the Independent Korean Government!
BASTARD!
Run!
Stop the KOREANS!!
STOP THEM ALL!!
CLOSE THE BUNKER!! GET INSIDE!!!
YOU BASTARDS!
Hey! Wait for us!
Help Us!
GET UP!
YOU WANNA GET YOURSELF KILLED?
LEAVE ME!!
Don't Move! Don't
shoot! It's me, Yoon...
YOON HAK CHUL!
MR. YOON!
MR. YOON!
Are you okay? I am okay.
Are you hurt?
How are you? I'm fine.
We should get out of
here. Did you see the
book? Don't worry! I'm
gonna get it myself!
Did you read the book?
MR. YOON
I'm on your side till
the end of..... UH.....
HELP!
HELP!
HELP!
Silence.
MR YOON! ARE YOU OKAY?
Hey! Hey!
Is Kang Uk dead also?
Someone told us that they saw his
dead body. We're looking for it also.
Papa! I'm thirsty.
Hey Pops! Why did
you give me beer?
KOREANS OUT!
KOREANS OUT!
KOREANS OUT!
KOREANS OUT!
Is the line connected?
Hold on with the supplies
left in the island!
EVEN THE MANAGER IS WOUNDED!
SHOULD WE ALL DIE HERE?
Yesterday! The US made a new bomb!
They fired it into Hiroshima!
A new bomb?
People residing near Hiroshima
said that it's a giant bomb.
Nothing official is yet reported, but
more than 100,000 people were sacrificed!
Nothing survived from that bomb!
The US made something
beyond our imagination!
Are we...
gonna lose this war?
After Hitler's death,
Germany surrendered.
The companies that helped the Nazis are
being sent to the War Criminal Judgement.
Even a tiny thing is a
disadvantage, so terminate
all the written
properties in the island.
If the War Criminal
Judgement's a big problem,
shouldn't we kill all the Koreans
whom are the best witnesses?
That's the best way but, Manager
Shimasaki's wounded like that!
You think it's possible?
Well, if you kill him quietly,
Of course, you'll be in charge!
KOREANS OUT!!!
Come here, you bastard!
YOU RUINED IT ALL!
Does is hurt?
To prevent disease,
we're burning them
so stop the identification.
YOU SHOULD ALSO BURN JAPS! WHY
ONLY KOREANS? WE'RE NOT TRASH!
The chaos might get worse, so don't tell
the death of Shimasaki manager to anyone.
Wear this first~
I couldn't find the one you
told, so I brought them all.
A Japanese girl
just got murdered.
Song Jong Gu saw it all.
The suspect is a Korean.
Good News!
We now got a good reason
to control the Koreans!
So Hee!
So Hee!
YOU'RE ALIVE! OF COURSE!
THOUGHT I WAS DEAD?
Why here? Let's go
to the canteen!
There's a man who must not
know that So Hee and I live.
I brought this.
Eat this?
Get the canned
goods from my box.
It's blown up by the air strike.
What? How about the money?
ALL?
We almost got killed.
If it's important, you
should have took it
yourself? Where were you?
Long Story... Didn't Yoon
Hak Chul ask where I am?
Till Hashima gets recovered,
I'll be in charge, instead of
the wounded manager Shimasaki.
The present moment when we
were sad of air strike,
An innocent girl just got killed by a man
who couldn't control his sexual desire!
Can't you see the poor family?
Come in front, if you
have conscience!
Who says it was
done by a Korean?
There is a witness here!
The witness will
point the suspect!
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU
SAYING? YOU BASTARD!
That's enough! You
FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!
I want a cool bowl of noodles.
With salt inside? The
good taste of soup?
I prefer sugar.
Okay. Let's make it with sugar.
Noodles yeah!
With radish inside!
Stop it! Stop it!
It will make us starve worse.
The moment we escape here,
let's eat noodles first, okay?
It means we could go home?
Of course!
That is why your
father's helping me.
But now, So Hee must
help me for something.
Could you help?
Mr. Yoon! I know you'll get out of
here when you have your chance.
If I take you to the US camp, could
you explain to the Americans,
that I helped you and your people
to get independent from Japan?
The current manager's dead, so you're
the next one, will it be necessary?
I've been thinking, but unless
we're fools, we all know that
this war ain't gonna
give us victory.
I'll take you out, so hand
over all the documents
that you and the manager
wrote for money.
Can we go out now?
The coal transferring ship's
almost at the end of recovering.
The line's also fixed, so it's not
a big work to take you out but
to transfer my family in
Nagasaki to another place,
we must terminate all the remaining
Koreans as the Head Office wants.
What do you mean termination?
There should be no Koreans
left who remembers
all the things that
happened in this island.
Where did Yoon hid his precious?
Identification List of
All Korean Workers.
"I was about to rape her
coz I don't like Japs
and I didn't like to work
in the Labor Service
but she tried to rebel so I
strangled her to death."
Can't you just say it, huh?
Just say yes and print
your finger here.
I'LL CALL YOU MY BIG BOSS!
SONG JONG GU! I'll gonna fold you
like I fold my own blankets.
That's how I'm gonna kill you.
YOU FUCKING BASTARD!
Transfer all the
dynamites inside there.
Tomorrow morning, we're gonna
put all the Koreans there.
Tomorrow morning, Yamada will put
us all in the mine and kill us.
including women
children also.
I beg you!
I don't care myself!
but at least So Hee
should make it out.
You could go out with So Hee
at least, couldn't you?
I will
with all the Koreans together.
It's our right to be served well in this
island coz we pour our sweat and blood.
Today's case of Choi Chil
Sung is the case of abuse
which we Koreans have
experienced through the years.
I met manager Shimazaki
to make an open court,
to prevent all the case
of improper situation.
The Nego that I did was
firstly, improve the quality
of the food. Secondly,
decrease the requested amount of coal.
Thirdly, no work during weekends.
Fourthly, special salaries will
be given during recovery.
Lastly, all the wounded
will be sent to KOREA!
THEY WILL SEND US BACK
TO OUR HOME! KOREA!
But since we got what we want,
We should do something.
Tomorrow's gonna be the
first day of recovery.
What he asked was a new
start. So he said men,
women, and children will
all enter the mine.
We're gonna have a ceremony
inside there, What say you?
I REFUSE!
YOON HAK CHUL DIDN'T
MEET THE MANAGER!
COZ HE'S DEAD!
ONCE YOU ALL GO IN THAT MINE,
YAMADA WILL BURY YOU ALL!
PARK MU YOUNG! CUT
THE SHIT RIGHT NOW!
THE US OCCUPIED OKINAWA!
THE WAR IS AT IT'S END!
YOON HAK CHUL WILL BURY YOU ALL IN THE
MINE AND RUN AWAY TO THE US WITH YAMADA!
THAT GUY IS NOTHING BUT A SPY!
YOU PEOPLE ARE THE PERFECT
WITNESSES TO PROVE
THE JAPANESE ILLEGAL
WEAPON PROVISION!
THAT'S WHY THE COMPANY HEAD WANTS YOU
ALL DEAD TO CLEAN THE WITNESSES!
EVERYONE! WHO DO YOU BELIEVE?
YOU GODDAMN FUCKING BASTARD!
THAT GUY'S REALLY
A PIECE OF SHIT!
LISTEN EVERYONE!
THAT LAD, PARK, IS A KOREAN SOLDIER
WHO CAME TO TAKE YOON OUT OF HERE!
BUT...... WHAT A TOTAL SHIT!
YOON WAS CAUGHT BY PARK HELPING
THE MANAGER. SO HE SHOT PARK!
THIS'S THE DOCUMENT! YOON AND MANGER TOOK
ALL THE SALARIES THAT BELONGS TO YOU!
THE MONEY FOR THE DEADS! YOU
EVEN TOOK THAT ONE ALSO!
THIS GUY KANG UK EVEN SOLD HIS
CHILD TO THE JAPANESE FOR WEALTH!
WHAT THE FUCK!
THAT GUY PARK IS SOMEONE WE
DON'T KNOW CLEARLY, RIGHT?
THAT'S RIGHT!
PARK AND KANG UK MIGHT BE A SPY!
CAN THEY PROVE THEY'RE NOT?
WAIT!
WE SHOULD GATHER FORCE TOGETHER!
DON'T BE FOOLED BY THEM!
SOME PEOPLE FROM NO WHERE SUDDENLY MADE
RUMORS OF OUR MR. YOON! THAT'S ENOUGH!
I SAW IT!
UNARM YOURSELF PARK!
FRIENDS ARE COMING!
I SAID I SAW IT!
I SAW YOU SHOOTING PARK
AND BROTHER CHOONG-HO
HEY JANG-WOO! ARE YOU BEING
FOOLED BY THEM ALSO?
WHAT WILL BE LEFT AFTER BETRAYING
THE PEOPLE! WHY ARE YOU WITH THEM?
WAKE UP JANG-WOO! STOP IT NOW!
LOOK AT THIS! ARE YOU
STILL GONNA LIE?
Forty YOON HAK CHUL! THIS'S UR ID
NUMBER, GRABED BY THE DEAD BROTHER!
DON'T TRUST ON WHAT YOU SEE OR
HEAR! YOU'RE ALL BEING DECEIVED!
I SAW IT! THAT
OLDMAN IS A BAD GUY!
EVEN THAT LITTLE GIRL SAW IT?
WELL LET US CHECK
THE DOCUMENT THEN!
WOW WOW WOW! WHAT A SURPIRSE!
GIVE US A PROOF
THAT THEY'RE WRONG!
ITO DAKAMICHI NAMED
AS YOON HAK CHUL!!!
THE MONEY YOU EARNED IS NOTHING
BUT THE DIRTY MONEY OF JAPS!
YOUR CRIME IS THAT YOU
WERE ON THE JAPS SIDE!
I WAS TRYING TO SAVE
MONEY FOR INDEPENDENCE!
YOU TOOK ALL THE MONEY FROM
THE PEOPLE WHO SPILT BLOOD!
IS THIS INDEPENDENCE
ONLY FOR ME?
YOU PRETENDED TO BE A GOOD
LEADER AND FOOLED THEM!
YOU FOOLS!
YOUR BETRAYAL WILL BE,
IF YOU KILL ME, YOU THINK
INDEPENDENCE WILL COME?
PUNISHED IN THE NAME
OF ALL KOREANS!
YOU LIVED TILL NOW
BECOZ I... UH...
So what shall we do?
Even one going out failed every time.
But we can go out all together, huh?
The failure was because Yoon gave
the manager all the informations.
If we get the coal-collecting boat near
the coal collecting area, we can make it!
Who will sail the boat?
I think there are some
people who could sail.
FULL EXPERIENCED
FISH BOAT SAILOR!
I know how to do,
so give me 5-6 men.
Hey! You think fish boat and
coal-collecting boat are the same?
Secondly, if we all move, then
there will be a big fight.
How will you solve it?
Soldiers here were sent to his place
coz they're not suitable for war.
Recently, we're bombed.
They're also afraid!
We have more people than
them! Also trained!
It's not yet late! So let
us talk with the JAPS!
The JAPS are open-minded.
So let us have some talk...
FUCK YOU! WHAT DID
YOU SAY? TALK?
If they know how to talk with
us, why are we like this now?
Have you forgotten the genocide
they did to us in Japan?
What a technician! You didn't work in
the mine. That's why you say like that!
Technician? Come
on! Say it again!
Divide! If you want to go
then go, not then stay.
Right! Let's divide! Surely they
won't kill all the people here!
Right?
PAPA! We can't go out?
FUCK! I AM ABOUT TO GET MAD!
YOU TYPICAL KOREAN SPICIES! WE SHOULD
MAKE A SOLUTION BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!
YOU GUYS WERE BEATEN UP
LIKE SLAVES! BUT EVEN
WITHOUT BEATING, YOU
NOW ACT LIKE SLAVES?
I'm gonna go out with my kid.
Hey! Let's just go without them.
Just a second!
Me too.
I became a disabled. So I must
die here? Can't do that shit!
Sister! What if we get killed?
We should live. They say that
the living is the winner!
We lost our lives here.
We can't lose it again!
Hey there!
I wanna go also.
Are you really staying?
You are going with them? Do
you trust them? Think wisely.
Let's go to Japs! Let's Go!
There's no time left! I'm not
gonna persuade you anymore!
Are out of you mind?
Our secret plan must not be informed
to the Japs! I hope you understand!
You must be tied up,
so you could live!
Giving medicine after
giving wound? JANG WOO YOU!
Careful!
Can't see Chil Sung's men.
What if they went to the Japs?
They went to save Chil Sung.
What? They won't know
what will happen.
Let's proceed faster than usual!
BIG BOSS!
Why did you come?
They say some court shit, but let's
go out before it gets worse.
Just think as if it's
a training session.
You'll be divided into groups.
If the grouping's done, you'll be signed
to move. Women, wounded, children first.
Our final goal's to walk
over the mine-transferring
bridge and get into the
boat. Then escape.
These are the dynamites
from the mine.
The bomb group will tie
them all with strings.
It'll enlarge the explosion!
The wounded will make shields.
Women will make ropes.
The weapon team will collect
all the weapons and gasoline.
Kang Uk and the Orchestra will
collect empty bottles for molotovs.
The Shipmen will take the
boat with me outside.
The rest,
will move after the
signal from the boat.
Dangerous! Do not touch!
Why are you like that to me?
What makes you here?
I'll bring them
once you're ready.
Don't go alone.
Let's go together.
You think 400 people could possibly
escape without being discovered?
Even wounded people are there.
Then, are you planning war?
They will die
tomorrow, eventually.
These bullets won't kill the
Japs all. You will be dead also.
Hey! Did Park forget
to kill them?
They weren't in that
position a moment ago!
Who is it? It's me!
Hey man! It's me! Me! Me!
Kang Uk! What are you
doing here? Go inside!
Yeah! What am I doing here?
What are you doing?
Come here, girls!
Yamada will have a big
event tomorrow. So he said
give a cup of drink to
the furthest soldiers.
Oh Really?
Where did you get it?
Shimasaki hid it.
Yamada released it.
He said only a cup.
It's better not drinking
if you only taste a cup.
Oh! I want to know the taste!
Come and sit here!
Women and wounded first.
Is this okay?
No guards.
It costed me a lot to
bring Korean girls!
The manager will kill us!
No one's gonna know we did it!
They'll think that the idiot
Koreans kicked their candles!
Out of my way!
Women & Wounded first!
I am wounded also. This girl's
young, so we should go first.
Hey brother! Look at the
wounded people around here!
Ok then! But So Hee
can go first, right?
GO UP NOW!
Sun will rise! Just follow
this disabled guy, okay?
Don't worry.
Just follow me.
TO THE COAL STORAGE!
THE KOREANS ARE RUNNING AWAY!
The Japs have found out!
We will go together, so
you go first and wait!
I'm a man with his word!
Till the Koreans make their
way, we secure the back!
THE KOREANS ARE RUNNING
AWAY AFTER FIRING!
THE KOREANS ARE RUNNING
AWAY AFTER FIRING!
Over there!
Hurry! Go to the back!
SHOOTING GROUP! BOMBING GROUP!
It's a real war!
Don't even leave
one. Kill them all!

Give her a bowl of
sugared noodles.
That's her wish.
Take care of So Hee please.
I'm sorry. I wasn't a
good father to you.
Don't forget
to eat fresh eggs.
Sing a song for me.
Father..
Father..
Father..
Father.. Don't Go ..
PLEASE DON'T GO!
11:02AM August 9,
1945, Nagasaki.
Oh my! There are a lot
of Koreans in Nagasaki!
The Battleship Island started on Sep.
1890. From 1937 China-Japan
war till the Pacific War,
The Battleship Island that
affected a big amount of Japanese
Military Industry closed
on Jan. 1974. Due to the 1970
New Japanese Energy Project.
In 2015, The Battleship Island was
registered in the UNESCO included
in the Japanese Meiji Industrial
Revolution. The Japanese Government
is not following the advice of the
UNESCO which was told to inform
the history of the Battleship
Island to the world till Dec. 2017.
