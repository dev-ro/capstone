"The mountains close in
more and more tightly,
and it seems as though
there's no longer any hope.
Only a bit of sky is visible
directly above our heads.
It has a disheartening effect
on us.
We are overwhelmed
and keep silent.
Suddenly at a sharp turn
in the road,
a huge chasm opens up
on our right,
and quite close to us,
we see the ice-covered peak
of Mount Kazbek
with its glaciers
sparkling white in the sun.
It is cheek byjowl with us,
placid and tall, mute.
A mysterious feeling
courses through us.
The cliff stands there as if
conjured up by the other cliffs.
We feel as though
a being from another world
is looking at us.
I scramble out of the carriage,
get behind
the folding top and..."
What does it mean?
This means "son of beach."
"Bitch."
"Beach," it's, uh...
