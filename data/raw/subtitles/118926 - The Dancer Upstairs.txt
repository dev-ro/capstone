We're recording tonight, and so we
try to do things that actually...
I'm too tired to do.
But as Faye Dunaway,
I think it was, she said...
with "Bonnie And Clyde", she tried
to give people what they wanted.
That's a mistake, really.
I know. Boy, do I know.
You can do it, but you use all you
got trying to give what they want.
But I will learn my lesson soon...
and then you will buy more records,
right? 'Cause you'll want to see me.
Let's see what we can do
with this lovely, lovely thing...
that goes past
all racial conflict...
and all kinds of conflicts.
It is a reflective tune.
And sometime in your life
you will have occasion to say...
"What is this thing called time?"
You know, what is that? The clock?
You go to work by the clock,
you get your martini by the clock...
you have coffee by the clock, get on
the plane, arrive at a certain time.
- It goes on and on and on.
- Why does she talk?
- And time is a dictator, as we know.
- She's preparing to sing.
Where does it go? What does it do?
Most of all, is it alive? Is it a thing
that we cannot touch and is it alive?
And then one day you look
in the mirror. How old.
And you say,
"Where did the time go?"
General Lache, leaving
the palace to cast his vote...
asked people to look at the past
12 years and judge fairly.
He spoke briefly with a group
of supporters and then departed.
Polls show that his lead has eroded
sharply in the last few months...
particularly in the capital.
LATIN AMERICA
THE RECENT PAST
Papers.
Sergeant Rejas. Hello?
What about her?
She drove all night.
- What is that?
- It's his dog. We ran it over.
We're giving him a lift to Huanta.
- What was your dog's name?
- Tupac.
- Where have you come from?
- The capital.
That's 1 ,700 miles.
What brings you here?
Her father. He's being
buried this afternoon.
Sorry.
- Why do you have temporary papers?
- Mine were stolen.
Even temporary papers
need a photo.
Technically, I should detain you.
Pisac, stay with the truck.
Would you mind getting out, please?
How was the road?
Government assures us
it will be finished any day now.
I'm sure you have faith in all
government pronouncements.
- Yes, of course.
- I hoped to take that road tomorrow.
- Why?
- I've been promoted.
So, your name is Melquiades Durán?
And you're a laborer?
- Born in Galiteo de Marañón?
- That's right.
Has your colleague
always been corrupt?
I don't know about always. Certainly
in the three years I've known him.
Does that bother you?
I was a lawyer once, so regrettably
I have familiarity with corruption.
Distinguishing marks?
What's wrong with your neck?
- The country gives me a rash.
- The countryside?
That too.
I have to take you outside.
Will you take off your glasses?
That's it.
One second,
I'll be right with you.
Sergeant Rejas.
Hi, Sylvina. Listen, I have...
Pisac!
Pisac! What are you doing?
FIVE YEARS LATER
THE CAPITAL
Scoop tortilla, mamita.
What the fuck is that?
Jesus.
What?
"The point of the next century...
will be for man
to rediscover his gods.
Long live el Presidente Ezequiel."
Who the fuck's Ezequiel?
There's something in his throat.
- Yes, there is. Dynamite.
- Nice. Okay.
Sergeant Gómez? Sergeant Gómez?
It's Lieutenant Rejas.
Will you check in our library
any reference to a person...
or perhaps an organization
called Ezequiel?
Like the prophet.
No, Gómez, in the Bible. And also
what a dead dog might symbolize.
Yes, thank you.
Have you any ideas, sir?
In my village, when you died,
your family hung your dog with you.
Why?
- Dogs swim good in the underworld.
- People believe that?
Sucre, where I grew up...
we were taught foreigners
came to rob our body grease...
and that the government used this
human fat to lubricate its machines.
Sir...
should I ask him if he wants
to borrow my penis?
Should I?
Lieutenant Rejas? Sergeant Sucre?
I'm Major Kwan.
Thank you for helping us out.
At the other side of the building
there's a door in the wall.
In the next few minutes,
a man will walk up.
It is requested that you open
the door, wait by the car...
and make sure no one engages him in
conversation or takes his photograph.
And for your information,
do be discreet in what you say.
There are microphones everywhere.
Pull your car over there. Thank you.
- And who is this person?
- A private citizen.
- Hey! What's in the briefcase?
- My laundry.
His laundry.
Yes?
Don't worry, I'll spell it out
for you. E-Z-E...
Q-U-I...
E-L. Yes.
Excuse me, weren't you a junior
partner at Belaunde & Vargas?
Yes, I was.
Welcome, Mr. President.
Congratulations on your election.
- Good luck, Mr. President.
- Viva el Presidente!
Let me hang this up first.
DEATH TO DENG XIAO PING
LONG LIVE PRESIDENT EZEQUIEL
Yeah, rice wine has
that effect on me too.
So who was that
shadowy motherfucker?
Tristán Calderón. He's a lawyer.
He represented the drug cartels.
He represented that pretty soldier
who made all the students disappear.
He also represented the President
elect in a statutory rape case.
- How do you know?
- I worked at the law firm...
...which acted as counsel for the girl.
- I never heard that. What happened?
She dropped it after her father lost
his job and her brother was raped.
- She now lives in Miami.
- Jesus Christ!
Fuck.
WHEN I HEAR THE WORD CULTURE
I REACH FOR MY PISTOL
Okay. Now...
what sort of a person would do that?
I don't know, but I wouldn't
entirely rule out a cat lover.
I've something for my father,
Sr. Granizo.
Okay. Sr. Granizo!
Here's your son!
Papa! Papa!
Viva el Presidente Ezequiel!
"Viva el Presidente Ezequiel."
- You were a lawyer before.
- That's right.
Lawyers. They're the worst.
Bent, you never catch them.
- You want one?
- No, thank you, sir.
- Why did you want to be a lawyer?
- I don't think I did want to be.
- What did you want to be?
- I wanted to be a coffee farmer.
- Like my father.
- So why didn't you?
- What stopped you?
- I lack a coffee farm.
- What happened to your father's?
- The military seized it.
Do you have a feeling about that?
Or are you the Gary Cooper type?
I do have a feeling about that, but
perhaps I am the Gary Cooper type.
So...
you went to university, you got
yourself a first-class degree.
A prestigious law prize.
Worked with a bunch of
fat cats. Suddenly you quit.
Not to move to Florida, like anyone
with half a fucking brain...
but to San Luis Police Academy.
Jesus Christ, Rejas.
You're 36 years old. You could
be heading for a judgeship by now.
Not a lieutenant, having to make
ends meet on diplomatic road watch.
- Why are you here?
- I heard a powerful attorney say...
that establishing the truth was only
one of the things a trial is for.
That is when I understood
the law wasn't for me.
- Do you have a delicate constitution?
- No, sir. No.
You speak Quechua?
- Well, yes. My mother's part Indian.
- At police college...
we used to make
the Indians eat dog shit.
Then it's fortunate that
I wasn't in your class, sir.
- Fortunate for whom?
- I should think both of us.
Here's what I want you to do.
I want you to take four people...
if you can find four who aren't
on some criminal's payroll...
and I want you to investigate
this entity called Ezequiel.
Find it out before the Army does.
Want the Army on the streets again?
No, sir.
- You can go.
- Thank you, sir.
May I take this with me?
What did you tell Calderón
about Ezequiel?
Nothing.
You're not the only policeman
here who speaks Quechua.
"Man stoned to death.
A 33-year-old policeman...
was stoned to death
last week in Sierra de Pruna."
"Mystery surrounds body.
An unidentified body was found...
with the limbs hacked off
on a roadside near Jauja...
200 miles east of the capital.
A note attached to the man's neck...
was written in the victim's blood:
'Hurry to cut off
the fat arms of the damned."'
"A message found
on the body declared...
'Guns will make us powerful.
Butter will only make us fat."'
"Dead dogs suspended from
lampposts. Macabre spectacle."
"The body had been skinned alive
using a high-pressure water hose."
Working at the car wash, yeah
- Do you like it?
- Yes, it's really sweet.
- Where might I have put my Bible?
- I put those things in the cabinet.
Here?
Good morning.
Jesus Christ, are you
with the police force?
Sergeant Sucre, you begin.
We've drawn a blank
with the boy bomber, sir.
Part of his face was intact, so I've
circulated an artist's impression.
He was about 1 0 years old,
probably not a local.
Before entering the hotel, he drank
Inca-Cola, ate meatballs with rice.
But no one's claimed the body and
no one has heard of Ezequiel before.
So, we have no suspects.
- What about those dogs?
- Clorindo, please.
Yes. Well, as it turns out...
it's not the first time dogs
have been killed like that.
In the last election,
dogs were strung up...
in two villages in the Ayacucho
region. I've checked the folklore...
bearing in mind one or two
references to Deng Xiao Ping.
Yes, in China, you may
be interested to know...
a dead dog is symbolic of a tyrant
condemned to death by his people.
- Llosa.
- In the valleys around Huallaga...
masked groups have twice been
reported conducting kangaroo trials.
The targets in both cases were
government representatives.
They were executed in a ritualistic
way, with stones or knives.
Then messages were written
in their blood.
"A strategic equilibrium".
Anybody here know
what the fuck that means?
You've traced some of this... this
crap back to a German philosopher?
So far, I've found three
references from Kant...
...and 2 from the prophet Ezequiel.
- Yes, but who is this Ezequiel?
Some guy who never got laid?
Some smartaleck who reads too much?
Some creep on a bridge spitting at
the traffic? What is your theory?
Well, if it is a creep spitting off
a bridge, he has a lot of saliva.
It seems these actions
started in the countryside...
around the time
General Lache stepped out.
Most have taken place in
incredibly isolated communities...
where the idea of a central
government almost doesn't apply.
And there haven't been a ton
of them, about 37 in five years.
And at first glance they might
appear to be random and scattered.
- In no case was there ever a name.
- Lieutenant, what are you saying?
I'm saying that five years ago
these actions...
were thought to be by secret
wings of the Army, drug cartels...
or student organizations...
but in fact may not have been.
Well, then who is behind it?
We have a name, don't we?
We do now have a name.
But so far there isn't a manifesto,
a plan, a spokesperson.
We don't have any clue
as to who the leaders are.
There isn't an organization or
a known HQ. There is only Ezequiel.
So, what you're saying is
we don't know what he or she is...
...who they are or what they want?
- No, sir.
- Can you speak?
- Yes.
Any conclusion?
It appears a revolution
could be going on...
but a revolution that has yet to
declare itself in act or intention.
For the moment.
Tomcats. Do you know
anything about them, Rejas?
No, sir.
If you're looking for a tomcat, you
don't send two dogs up an alley...
because they knock over garbage
cans, bite, fight, fuck each other.
The cat just leaps up a tree,
pisses on them.
You send in someone who knows
the other one's way of thinking...
how he smells, how to meow.
You send in another tomcat.
So I want you
to be my tomcat, Rejas.
Very well, sir.
Sweetheart.
Where's your mother?
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
Marco sent the camera and the film.
He got it and he already has one.
I know we can't afford it now, but
which one you prefer? I can't decide.
- The one you already have.
- You're just saying that.
- It changed Marina's life.
- Marina's had a nose job?
My God, Agustín,
how can you be a detective?
She's had three nose jobs
since you've known her.
- You want to look like your friends?
- I don't want to look like them.
I just don't want to spend my life
reminding people of Pinocchio.
- I've been promoted.
- Really?
I might even be paid now.
NINE MONTHS LATER
We wait six weeks for him to put
another packet in the fridge.
And last night we grab him.
But what's in the packet this time?
A leg of ham. We have to let him go.
6 weeks watching a fucking freezer!
Did you confiscate the ham?
Yes, it's what we're
having for lunch.
- What about the student haunts?
- We got 4 cafés under surveillance.
But we have to do it on rotation.
It takes a lot of manpower.
Keep at it for the moment.
What else have we got?
Two homosexuals beheaded.
And they shot the mayor of Silar.
Silar? Any suspects?
Just 23 million.
Then we are narrowing it down.
- Lf he's a democrat I'm an astronaut.
- They could find him if they wanted.
I know him. Quite
a few people know him.
And even more people know
why we need him.
What we are discussing here
is a new birth...
and a new birth involves blood.
Okay, who says:
"It's necessary that our
civilization builds its temples...
on mountains of corpses,
on an ocean of tears...
...on deaths without number"?
- Napoleon.
Charo?
- Von Hassler?
- Right. Who said:
"I'd like the last king strangled
by the sash of the last priest"?
- Mussolini?
- No.
- Pol Pot?
- Lord Rochester?
Jean Messelier.
Who said: "Man's ultimate
desire is to be God"?
- Who is Ezequiel?
- It's possible...
- Oh, fuck!
- Why? Why do you say possible?
- 'Cause I'm not sure.
- But you said you were.
It's possible he was
a Kantian philosopher...
of no small distinction. I taught
with him at San Cristóbal, Ayacucho.
- And why do you think he's Ezequiel?
- Because of who he believed he was.
- Like?
- The fourth flame of Communism...
after Mao, Lenin and Marx.
He was also fond of quoting
the prophet Ezequiel.
You're a man who
understands history, right?
If you want to start a revolution,
why not issue a manifesto?
Why not show the people
who you are, what you are doing?
That's perfectly understandable.
Socrates wrote nothing down.
Neither did Jesus. You see,
the problem with text is...
that it assumes its own reality.
It cannot answer, it cannot explain.
So, if you wanted to be effective,
you'd leave no trace. Right?
That's right.
- Describe him.
- But this was ten years ago.
Then concentrate.
Average height...
glasses, dark hair, thin.
- Dress?
- Left Bank look.
Supposedly he'd been in Paris.
Always a cigarette in his mouth.
- Can you remember the brand?
- Very well.
He made this thing of
preferring unfiltered Camels.
- Would you have a photo of him?
- He'd never allow that.
I see.
So what is this person's name?
Rivas.
Edgardo Rodríguez Rivas.
Fine. Thank you very much.
No, honey, wait.
Marco saw the guy who wrote it on
TV. He thinks women here'll love it.
I just hope Marina doesn't find out
where I got the idea from.
Would you read my speech? Two pages
is enough, isn't it, for 10 minutes?
I'd happily trade.
- Let me see.
- And you will be here to help?
You're not going to wriggle out
of my literary evening?
Of course I'll be here.
This novel is about
a photographer cowboy...
who is always bringing light
into women's lives.
- Agustín.
- Hi, Marina.
I can't read my handwriting.
Is this the ballet school?
This is it, big boy.
Brought your tutu?
- Where's Sylvie?
- At the vet.
- How's Mom's apartment?
- Listen, we're...
- Sorry we are behind with the rent.
- I know you'll pay when you can.
Anyway, don't worry about that.
Is it true what Sylvie said?
They've put you in charge?
- Sylvina told you?
- Yeah.
- We can't talk about that publicly.
- I'm not talking about it publicly.
Is there a revolution going on? Come
on, you promise to tell me, Agustín.
- Or I will never know what to wear.
- I'll keep that in mind.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Yes?
Have you a moment?
I'm Laura's father.
Yolanda. But Laura's left.
You didn't see her?
- Yes, she's in the car.
- Don't you want to bring her in?
I'd rather not.
It's about your letter.
Laura has told you, I guess.
You want some cake?
I made it this morning.
So, this is it?
I'm sorry about the mess,
but I wasn't expecting anyone.
Here is the money.
I'm sorry the check bounced.
It may not be the last. My employers
are in arrears with our salaries.
Don't worry. You're not the first
ballet father to bounce a check.
And if you need it back,
you know where it is.
- Sit down.
- No, thank you.
Your daughter is
a real spot of sunshine.
I'm completely soaked!
I'm not sure you can
answer this, but...
should we encourage Laura?
I mean, my wife is keen for her
to join the Metropolitan.
- Well, they do take very few.
- Then, are we wasting our time?
I have the feeling she would rather
try the kind of things I do.
What is that?
- Minister Quesada likes the theater?
- No, he hates the theater.
But one of the actresses
sent him some...
You said it'd be a musical!
Is it a life you recommend?
It depends if you want
your daughter to turn out like me.
What does that mean,
turning out like you?
No idea. I'm usually moving too much
to think about that, thankfully.
Bring back Robert Wilson!
- You funded this!
- Get on with it!
- Must be very demanding physically.
- Yes, sometimes.
- Why does Laura need a diet?
- No, she shouldn't be on a diet.
- She needs energy and she's lovely.
- I think so. Yes, I think so.
Did they cut the lights everywhere?
DEATH TO ALL TRAITORS
LONG LIVE PRESIDENT EZEQUIEL
- Daddy?
- Sorry, sweetie. I'll be right out.
- But...
- What is it, Laura?
I answered your phone and you should
call the fisherman immediately.
Would it be too much if I left Laura
here till her mother can collect her?
But she doesn't need to collect her.
It isn't far and I'd like a walk.
Thank you,
that's very kind of you.
Remember, we don't tell people
what Daddy does for a living.
- Of course not. Will you be okay?
- Of course. Tell Mom I'll call her.
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.
Come.
We walk to the end of Calle Diderot
and then we turn left at the corner.
Three dead: The minister,
his wife and the bodyguard.
- Sir, can I remove this?
- Yes, sir.
Who were they?
Students, they said.
From the Catholic University.
- No names, and they paid in cash?
- I was grateful for the business.
Merino has spoken to the Americans
and Canadians. They volunteer help.
Fine. Thank you.
When did minister Quesada arrive?
Someone's celebrating.
- You drive.
- Okay.
Stop! Wait!
Wait!
Who gave these to you?
Who gave these to you?
- Where did you get these posters?
- We were paid.
- Who paid you? Who?!
- The wind blew it into my hand.
- Get into the car. They'll kill you.
- I'm dead already.
A THOUSAND EYES
Is that him?
- Yes.
- How do you know?
I took the photograph.
After an emergency meeting to
discuss the execution of Quesada...
the President returned to his
chambers. This was over his toilet.
Roughly translated, it says:
"Missed you at the opening,
but you'll be soon flushed away."
The photograph is uncredited,
you'll be pleased to hear.
General Merino...
11 months ago, I called to ask what
this office knew about Ezequiel.
Today, our city woke up
to pictures of his face everywhere.
May I ask again what
you know about this man?
Well, the leads
are still very scarce.
I remind you, until last night, very
little had happened in the capital...
and we had almost
no resources for investigating.
All we know is there's been
a series of incidents...
which sometimes have a connection
with the name Ezequiel.
So you don't know that
he's called Edgardo Rivas?
That he was a professor
of philosophy at Ayacucho?
That these incidents, which you feel
may be developing into a pattern...
are in fact
327 separate actions...
up to and including the murder
of 6 policemen, 3 mayors...
11 city counselors and
the Minister of the Interior?
Gentlemen, it strikes me there's
actually a revolution going on.
Why the Chief of Police has seen
fit to keep the Palace in the dark?
I've proceeded with this case as
I have done in my whole career.
It is a matter for the police
and for the Judiciary.
I refuse to detain people without
evidence that they are implicated.
And last night?
Are you asking me what goes on
in the President's bathroom?
No, Captain, I'm asking you
about Quesada's murder!
It was a theater group.
Two men and four women.
Allegedly from
the Catholic University.
I interviewed the only group there,
and they had nothing to do with it.
The President and five of his
ministers were also sent tickets.
"Blackout".
Lucky it wasn't "Evita",
or we might not have a government.
What else can you
tell us about Rivas?
This man hasn't
been seen in ten years.
In that time, what do you suppose
has been going through his mind?
I think he thinks that the capital
is the head of the monster...
that if the tree gives rotten
fruit, then you cut down the tree.
Is that what you think?
I think just because the President
is a rapist, democracy isn't bad...
and success might have come had we
reacted earlier, with a clear policy.
And if the State was just, generous,
firm. Unfortunately, the State isn't.
This professor.
I'd like to interview him.
He's disappeared.
- Why did I know you'd say that?
- Maybe he's in Miami.
Key witnesses often turn up there.
You have two more weeks
to catch Ezequiel.
If this government is threatened or
there's another incident like this...
I will bring in the Army with such
rapidity, such clarity of intent...
that you won't be worrying
about legal niceties.
Then I'd like a list of staff with
access to the President's chambers.
Happily, there are only two of them.
The first is named Fuck.
The second is named Off.
How would the President feel about
seeing soldiers on the streets again?
Let the President's advisors worry
about the President's feelings.
Then I suggest their security
should be especially vigilant, sir.
I've already given instructions.
No restaurants, no beach.
Not even church.
No church?
- How old are you?
- Viva el Presidente Ezequiel!
- Well done. Zileri, isn't it?
- That's right, sir.
- Come with me. Any sign of the Army?
- I kept the location off the air.
Apparently, there were three. They
took off on foot, dragging someone.
- Watch the car.
- Yes, sir.
Listen, look everywhere.
You can go. Go, go!
It's okay.
Help's coming.
Help's coming.
Long live President Ezequiel!
You'll see a church
with a tin steeple.
- We'll be there in two minutes.
- Fine.
You can go.
Blank, blank, blank,
all fucking blank, shit!
Wait, here!
There's something.
There's something. Looks like...
...Chinese. And some weird word.
- Might be Greek.
What about these?
"91092, Hola. 17891 , Elle.
24390, Doña cover."
What? A code, maybe?
Captain Rejas? Captain
Montesinos, Military Police.
- I'm taking over this investigation.
- Under article 6223 of our Code...
...you trespass on a crime scene.
- Not anymore.
As of 7:50 PM, the President
declared martial law.
This is no longer your crime scene.
I ask you to leave this house.
- I hope I can pull this by myself.
- Then you say...?
- I've to get back in business again.
- Okay. And then you go...
Hey, guys! I need to lock up!
And as Silk Leigh
says to Katharine:
"Old soul, don't worry,
you will survive.
The strong tend to live."
Isn't that clever?
I don't know whether to say "what's
happened to you" or "can I watch?"
I had a girl die in
my arms with her face...
...blown off.
- Oh my God.
They've declared martial law.
That should give you some
indication of what to wear.
- Yeah, sort of.
- How was your evening?
Sylvina's report was great.
But that book is shit. Just the
kind of crap Marco actually read.
Laura.
ADMIRAL PRADO ASSASSINATED
17 DRAMA STUDENTS KIDNAPPED
What's going on?
Investigation now is in the hands
of the security forces.
They're taking all our files to copy
and they've cancelled our overtime.
Was that you?
You nuts? Look at my face. How you
think I keep it this way? It was her.
Don't touch those.
They're personal.
I asked you not to take them away.
Our orders are to take everything.
- Stop! Stop!
- Let him go!
I said stop already!
- Get off!
- I thought the world had gone deaf.
How dare you kill the group?! I told
you we established their innocence!
It's okay. We don't
need copies of these.
By the way, you shouldn't be
so upset about this.
You're perfectly free
to continue your investigation.
It's just that from now on
you won't be so alone.
You know the great thing
about me, Llosa?
Do you?
Do you know what
I like so much about me?
The truth? Okay, I'll tell you.
What I like so much
about myself...
is that I could like myself
a lot more. Honestly.
I have that capacity...
Here she comes
I love to see your eyes
You're such a lovely girl
Oh, mamita, mamita
Llosa...
ask whether she wouldn't feel better
unencumbered by all that clothing.
Llosa, that's an order.
I meant that as an order.
Bye.
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
No gym today.
- Like a turn?
- No, thanks. I've seen her butt.
It's nice.
Jesus.
Police! On the ground!
Don't move! On the ground!
Viva el Presidente Ezequiel!
- Llosa, see you later.
- I hope so.
STATE OF SIEGE
