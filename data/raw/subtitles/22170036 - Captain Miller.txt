A few love to narrate stories.
A few love to listen to stories.
The story often undergoes change as
it passes from one individual to another.
I will narrate as my grandmother
passed it on to me.
And you can pass it on to your
granddaughter as you understand.
Likewise, people who died
doing good deeds...
are gradually identified
as great people and Titans...
and the stories of them
being worshipped as God spread all over.
I'm going to narrate to you all
one such story.
It's the story of our ancestor
Ravanan's rebirth of the deity Koranar.
It's a 600-year-old story.
During that time, King Ilavendhira
who ruled this land...
decided to build a temple for Shiva.
And went on to ask our ancestor's help
who lived in Pothigai Hills.
And the ancestors agreed
to give up the land.
And finally arrived at Mathalamparai.
While they were digging
to lay the foundation...
they discovered a miraculous gemstone.
The news of the discovery
spread across eight districts.
The Kings from the neighbouring districts
started to show interest in the gemstone.
It took twenty years to build the temple.
During the period of construction...
two wars were fought to steal the Gemstone.
The King and the throne were in peril,
and so was our land.
But our ancestor Koranar saved it all
single-handedly with his life.
Killed many enemies during the war
and sacrificed his life.
On witnessing the bravery
of our Ayya Koranar...
King Ilavendhira indebted
by his brave sacrifice...
...raised the Shivan Temple
and the surrounding land deed
to the people of this village.
Our ancestors made a figurine of Koranar
with the Gemstone...
and gifted it to the King.
They say that the gemstone is still
hidden somewhere within the Kingdom.
Many made attempts to steal it.
But they failed!
[Sri Valli - Kaayatha Kanagathe song]
Are you feeling guilty
for giving up your comrade?
- Oh, God, no!
- He can't bear the beating!
Please, don't beat him.
Oh, God, no!
Oh, God!
Please spare him, Ayya!
I don't know what to do!
Ayya, I don't know what to do.
Oh, no,
they beat you to death mercilessly.
Hurry up!
CAPTAIN MILLER
Three officers...
Fifty bullets...
Was it for killing an old man in his name?
Or for not adding Captain
as a prefix to his name?
I don't know.
Earlier, Miller was not outraged
by the Britishers.
Who do you think is responsible
for all the conflicts?
Is it Miller?
Or the Governor's son, Riley?
Or is it the King of this Kingdom,
Rajatthipathi?
Who is it?
Kuyili mentioned that the Princess
was going to visit the temple.
She is studying medicine in the city.
She mentioned that the Princess's glow
is shinier than the temple's.
Eesa, since I heard I wanted to
see the Princess at least once.
- If we go to the temple...
- They won't even let us in.
If Mother were alive,
she would've whacked you with a broom.
Who are they to stop us?
Why should we fear?
We are going to the temple today
and see the Princess.

- We'll keep it over there.

Please give me some buttermilk.
- Who's going to pay for it?
- I'll pay you later.
- Where were you all this while?
- Looking for your husband.
Oh, God! I'm short of breath.
The blood shot to my head.
The Princess was lovely.
To me, that girl was more
beautiful than the Princess.
Sounds like you're smitten by her.
Huh, so you are the infamous thieves.
They would've hung you both.
Forget about it. Who is that girl?
Are you going to tell?
Or shall I reveal your secret?
- Tell me. Who is she?
- Velmathi.
She is King's niece.
She lost her parents during childhood.
The King and the Prince
raised her since then.
She studies in the same college
as the Princess.
Rumour has it that the King and
the Prince killed the girl's parents.
People say that the King has a mistress
and a son with her named Kandhiya.
Who was born to whom?
There is confusion when it comes
to King's family.
I don't care a damn about it.
The girl who held my hand
despite knowing who we are...
and saved my life is the most beautiful.
As you were near the exit,
she held your hand.
If I were near the exit,
she would've held my hand.
You were not. So, shut up!
Beat him! Skin him alive!
- How dare you enter the temple?
- Ayya, please don't beat me!
Please don't beat me.
Who gave you the right to beat us?
Beat him, too!
Tell me, would it be blasphemy
if our people entered the temple?
You slave the people who built the temple
and make them stand guard.
But you enter the temple!
Stomp him!
Following faith is not an issue.
But when the faith impacts our lives,
it becomes a problem.
- Go!
- Please don't beat us.
Please don't beat us.
I'll kill you!
Velmathi?
Velmathi?
Please stop.
This is irrelevant to you.
Come!
Have you decided
to go against your uncle?
It was my mistake.
I should get the beatings, too.
Why are they only beating them?
Don't act too smart.
If Shakunthala was not present here...
you would not have lived
to see the daylight.
But if you repeat this nonsense again.
None of us can save you.
Be within your limits.
Don't you feel it's wrong to prevent the
village folks from entering the temple?
Aren't you dearest to your father?
Why don't you question him?
What do you want me to ask?
Velmathi, will it make a difference
if I question my father?
Get this into your head.
Lower caste, upper caste,
palace, and a hut.
Everywhere women are considered slaves.
As women, we are subservient.
If we want our voices heard...
we must be in power.
What happened, Eesa?
You say that you want to join the military.
But now you're making a wrong move.
You would've died for entering
the temple yesterday.
You better remember it.
Listen, I'll go inside and then ask her.
If she nods yes I won't join the military.
Okay?
Why are you anxious for no reason?
You carry on, Eesa. Ignore her.
Since Pechiamma is not there,
you don't fear anymore.
Velmathi!
Velmathi!
Velmathi, please hear me out.
Stop and hear me out once.
Think about it and then make a decision.
Why are you in a hurry?
Fine, let me talk to my father
and my brother.
I have made my decision.
You, too, leave.
Go back to Madras.
Think hard and then make a decision.
You go!
Stay right here. I'll be back.
Stay right here. Don't go anywhere.
- Shakuntala!
- You wait. I'll be back.
My Lord...
We have information from Kanagasabai
that young Princess is eloping.
He's going out personally to look for her.
Wait!
We have a reason to kill her now.
If Shakunthala is here,
she won't let us do anything.
Send her back to Madras.
You can't go past us.
Hey, who are you? Hey!
Oh, no! Spare me!
I have a family to look after.
I'm innocent.
- Let's go. Come on!
- Hey!
Go away.
You're Velmathi, right?
Why is everyone chasing you?
Do you remember me?
The other day, I was at the temple.
You too held my hand...
- Hey!
- Who are you?
He saved me.
You know him?
Thank you, Comrade!
Velmathi, you'll be in danger
if you come with me.
My organization and I...
will make sure no harm befalls you.
Let's go!
Let's go, Velmathi.
Thank you, Comrade!
Thank you!
You've been living underground
in the name of revolution.
Your mother passed away, too.
As it is they've been troubling
the village.
Yesterday, he went inside the temple,
but Vanangamudi took the heat.
Now again, he went inside the temple.
Hold on, I'll talk to him.
Eesa, what's wrong with you?
What are you doing?
I'm joining the military, Sengannan.
I was meaning to take it up.
Now I have made up my mind.
I'm determined to chase away
the Britishers.
You're embarrassing me by
joining hands with them.
As it is, the village is cursing you.
- This is not right, Eesa.
- What is not right?
Please explain, Anna.
Are you fighting for independence?
Whose independence?
You are going to get independence
from the Britishers...
and hand it over to the Kings
who oppress us.
The Kings prevent us from entering
the temple built by our ancestors.
And you're fighting for them.
It's not like before.
- Times have changed.
- There's no change!
- Things will change here, too.
- I don't see any change.
Tell me!
Will they let us inside the temple?
Tell me, Sengannan..
Will they let our people inside the temple?
They treat us like feces.
Our kings prevent us from wearing sandals.
But in the military, the Britisher
gives me boots.
The Kings wants us to bow down to them.
But they let us eat along with them
as equals.
Our Kings oppress us!
But they respect me.
And that respect...
is my freedom!
If you want to fight for freedom,
go ahead. But I'm going.
If the Britishers are as good as you say,
They came for business,
but now they rule us.
Oh, God. Did we have freedom
before they arrived?
Huh?
Earlier the Kings ruled over us.
Now, the Britishers!
We were enslaved then and now.
How does it make a difference?
Hey, Eesa!
If Amma were alive,
she would not have let you go.
It's best you don't bring Amma into this.
Even on her death bed,
she was chanting your name.
I wonder if she knew
if I was there or not.
Where were you then?
There's no one here...
There's nothing here for me.
Amma is not here...
neither the people are there for me.
I don't see that you're there for me too.
I'm going to join the military.
When we make a wrong decision in life...
we call it fate...
and blame it on the God.
Is that God's decision?
Or is it our decision?
Tell me!
Why did you join the military?
For the country.
For the country, you say!
- What's your name?
- Karruppusamy!
Number - 11
Listen, everyone!
I stand before you...
Brothers in arms!
Every man in his first action is scared!
If he says he's not...
He's a goddamn liar!
But the real hero...
...is the man who fights
even though he's scared.
Some men under fire...
will get over their fright
in a minute.
Some take an hour.
Some in days!
The real Hero never lets his
fear of death...
overpower his honour...
his sense of duty to his country
and to the King!
The future of the King's crown
lies in your hands.
God save the King!

You joined the military for the country.
But he joined the military for respect.
What name have they assigned you?
Miller!
Sepoy Miller!
General Miller!
Jawan Miller!
Captain Miller!
Sounds good, right?
Captain?
You have long way to go, brother.
I don't mind how long it takes.
- What is your name?
- Same name.
My father gave me it to me.
I won't change my name.
Tesph, Tea-bun...
- He said something like it.
- Sembatta, sir!
What name did they assign to you?
They assigned me a name.
But I can't get it.
Could you read it to me
and explain what it is?
Let me see it.
Ste...
Stephen!
Stephen, uh?
Damn, what kind of name is it?
They assign a name because
they can't pronounce our names.
But we can't pronounce the name
assigned to us.
- It is... Ste...
- ...phen!
Stephen! Stephen!
Stephen... Stephen!
- Hey, Sembatta.
- Hey!
What name did they assign you?
Ste... What was it?
- Stephen.
- Stephen!
How can a cow herder like you
have a name like Stephen?
Ignore him!
Hey, that name is beyond
your worthiness.
There are fanatics everywhere.
Captain Miller!
Eesa...
Aren't you writing a letter?
- To whom?
- Whom?
Mother, father, or your lover.
My father died when I was born.
They killed my mother.
Eh... lover!
Before I could understand its love,
I lost it.
Bloody sinners!
They killed your mother?
Was it the Brits?
It was our people.
Even though I know who killed
my mother...
I'm incapable and outraged
that I can't rip his guts out!
Like I ignore everything else...
I moved on bearing this angst.
You write your letter.
You should be lucky
to have someone to write to.
You have a point.
You bloody morons!
It's bedtime!
Get into the bed!
Idiots!
Decking up a goat ritually,
does the goat not realize all of it
is to butcher it?
Hey, do you get it?
He's calling you a scapegoat!
Not just one scapegoat...
On that day, a herd of scapegoats
were marching ahead.
Where are they taking us?
It does not feel right.
Stop with the nonsense.
Why are you afraid?
To warn or to arrest
the Police were enough.
Why do they need us?
Don't talk nonsense.
It is our first assignment.
We need to do it diligently.
Look behind.
Sembatta a.k.a Stephen...
is walking with courage.
Eesa...
Bloody cowards!
Look at your face.
It's a shame we have weaklings
in our troop.
A brave soldier won't be afraid
of anything
and will be firm when he's ordered to kill.
A good soldier will follow
the Commander's orders!
But a brave warrior will only listen
to his heart.
Halt!
[freedom fighters sloganeering]
Take position!
I hope they won't ask us to shoot them.
FIRE!
FIRE!
I said bloody fire!
FIRE!
Hey! Hey, Stephen!
How could this be right?
How could this be right?
He was distraught to kill his own people.
Miller's heart was stormed with emotions.
Amma...
Eesa... Eesa...
Is this why they brought us here?
Had I known we had to kill our people,
I would've never joined the military.
Oh, God!
Eesa, you mentioned they killed
your mother.
Look behind. There are many mothers dead.
Rafi! Rafi!
An infant. An infant.
They've burned down infants.
Oh, God, no!
How am I going absolve my sins?
How am I going absolve my sins?
How am I going absolve my sins?
How am I going absolve my sins?
Amma!
Amma...
Amma?
Amma! Amma! Amma!
I did not... Amma, I did not do it.
Amma, this is their gun.
The Brits gave it to me.
It's not mine.
Amma?
Please don't give me that look.
Amma, please don't give me that look.
I did not do it.
I have blood on my hands.
It can be washed away
only with my blood.
I'll wipe the blood off my hands.
I'll wipe the blood off my hands, Amma.
I will wipe the blood off my hands.
I will wipe the blood off my hands.
I'll wipe the blood off my hands, Amma.
I'll wipe the blood off...
Stephen!
Stephen, what happened?
Stephen! Stephen!
Stephen!
Sembatta!
What a waste!
Burn him with the rest of the bodies!
We don't have time.
Get back to wor...
Are you going to die?
Do you want to die, too?
Enough lives are lost!
Go away, Eesa!
Go away, Eesa!
If you stay back you'll be in trouble.
Go away!
You go away, Eesa. Go!
Where will he go?
His only family is his brother, Sengolan.
He went looking for him.
He did go!
Why did you come here?
Are you here to kill us too?
Hey, what's wrong with you?
The 300 freedom fighters you shot dead...
One among them was your brother,
Sengolan, too.
Despite his warnings,
you went on to join the military.
- You're a curse to this village.
- Oh, God!
Don't come here.
Go somewhere far and die.
Bloody sinner!
You killed the only relation you had.
This village is not yours.
Neither are the people.
Leave this village and go somewhere
in oblivion.
Spare us and let us live in peace.
Let's go!
Living with the guilt...
is the worst of tortures.
He killed innocent people.
He killed his brother.
He was alive...
But he roamed like a living corpse.
When did Miller join your gang?
Two years ago...
during the heist near Twin Mountains,
we got caught by the Rangers.
That's when I met him
for the first time.
Hey!
Hey! Fall back!
Fall back!
Hey!
He's right there. Look to his right.
Look at him!
Sarathy, tightly fasten it.
It's going to be a long ride.
The eyes looking for Miller
will start looking for us, too.
Do you think it will work for us?
He has a point, Kannaiya!
Think about it
before you make the decision.
What should I think about?
You couldn't aim to shoot
at a 10-foot distance.
And I entrust you bunch
and carry out heists.
Did you watch him?
It must be more than 100 feet...
he shot him in the forehead.
He's ex-military!
We need men like him in our gang.
Looks like your gang does not
approve of me.
You killed a bad man.
You must be a good man.
One bad man can also kill
another bad man.

This play is dedicated to Doctor Ernesto,
who died during the struggle
for independence.
We believed
the country we live in is ours.
Also, we believed we had rights over it.
This country won't be a slave to anyone.
Help me with him.
Gone are the days that we lived on Fringe.
- Be careful.
- Bring him over here.
- Hold him right.
- Over here. Watch out.
It's now certain we are equals.
- Careful.
- Lay him over here.
Be careful.
Please come over to this side.
Then, who is this?
He's one of our gang members.
There's a bullet in his hip.
Yesterday...
- Was it Velmathi?
- Do you know her?
A dacoit in the eyes of Britishers.
A traitor in the eyes of our people.
What's your true identity?
Who you are...
And what you need from me
will decide who I am.
My name is Vincent Pillai.
I'm a friend of your brother, Sengolan.
We protested many and schemed plenty.
But we parted our ways.
He should not have died.
That was a non-violence movement.
It was not a movement
that involved weapons.
The 300 people you people shot dead...
not just your brother died in it...
but Doctor Velmathi's husband died, too.
I feel disgusted to have saved
my husband's killer...
Miller, please join our movement.
Not as a dacoit.
But as a murderer!
We are going to rip off a vital branch.
We need your help with it.
He's like a double-barrel gun.
He's not even aware of which barrel
will fire the shot.
We lost a lot of freedom fighters!
I need the obedient tigers.
Also, I need barbarians
who can rip off the tree.
I know who he will listen to.
I shall take my leave.
One minute!
What is it?
Do you know this gang?
What else did you notice?
They don't use guns.
Only bow and arrows.
I'm aware of this gang.
What's your concern?
They stepped into my territory...
and stole what I had schemed to steal.
Warn them.
Okay, I'll make sure they don't stop
into your territory.
Okay?
- I'll take my leave.
- Sure!
I was sitting and wondering for a while
whether to kill you.
I studied to save lives...
so I could not kill.
You could've killed me.
You might've spared me some mercy.
You have killed many.
I need you to kill for the movement.
Governor's son Riley.
He has been destroying our people
by the day.
Our plan to kill him failed.
Vincent Pillai believes
you're the man for it.
You didn't hesitate to kill
over 300 people...
another kill will be
a walk in the park.
Listen, Riley must die!
Had I been a killer like you...
I would've killed him myself.
Perhaps not for the movement.
For me...
I want him dead!
Kill one more person...
and absolve your sins!
We need a reply by tomorrow.

A hungry lion finds a prey.
But a pack of hyenas are waiting
to steal that prey.
In that situation,
what if a wolf takes away the prey?
They oppress us.
Like how we bow down to them.
The King bows down to the Brits.
The Kingdom secured this secret
over generations...
but a mole amongst us
have ratted us out to the Britishers.
I want to find that mole!
I don't know who to trust anymore.
A golden reward for your information.
You're a cunning fox!
You were with them all along
and gave up the secret.
What an exquisite view!
Yes indeed!
I simply cannot look away.
Yes, Your Excellency.
This land is originally ours.
But these tribes have occupied it.
We are trying to retrieve it now.
The Governor is aware of your situation.
He has told me of this place.
But this is the first time I'm seeing it
with my own eyes.
It is indeed the perfect setting...
in which to construct
the Governor's new hunting estate.
Yes, Your Excellency.
If they see me talking to you
they'll skin me alive.
- You go ahead.
- Fine, I'm going.
He's going to get me caught.
The sooner you can dispose
of these tribals, the better.
Sure!
Excellent! In the car!
Open the door.
For generations, we have been longing...
to see our deity Koranar at least once.
Never happened!
Now, they have taken it away.
My Lord, what about...
Before Kandhiya gets a whiff of it.
We have to retrieve the statue.
The dacoit in the village...
Miller... Eesa...
The maid who works in the Palace.
It's a good name. Yes, it's Kuyili.
Her brother and Eesa are friends.
Ask her brother to meet me.
The Britishers entered our temple...
and took away our property.
Tell me, where is Eesa?
Only he can retrieve it.
I will allow the village folks
to enter the temple.
But don't tell them yet.
Temple's property is our dignity.
I'm not doing this to capture Eesa.
But to save our dignity.
We want Eesa!
What happened to you?
You're not yourself.
You've changed a lot.
I changed when the bullet hit me.
I saw my death up close...
If I survived,
I planned to drop everything,
go to Ceylon, and start afresh.
Because the bullet hit...
...or Vel hit you?
On that night, I was sleepless.
I overheard your conversation
with Velmathi.
Do you know her from before?
I'm asking this favour for the sake
of the village.
If Eesa does what we ask of
the village people can enter the temple.
Aren't you coming with me?
Anna, Eesa won't do it
if he knows it's for the village.
If he sees me,
he will not agree to do it.
He will get angry.
I'll be right here.
Please convince him to do it.
If not for Velmathi,
Ayyavoo and I would've been long dead.
Even though it could put her in danger,
she helped us.
I'm the reason her husband died.
Also, I'm the reason my brother is dead.
Their deaths are killing me by the day.
I can't sleep.
You were right.
Velmathi is one of the reasons
why I want to go to Ceylon.
I reckon you're 19-years-old.
You have yet to live your life.
I know this gang is like your family.
But soon, these older men will die.
After that?
Go!
Drop everything and get married.
Have children.
Be happy.
How's marriage a solution?
I am a woman, and you're a man.
Isn't that your point?
I'm doing the dishes.
And you're cleaning a rifle.
I'm not a regressive man.
Eesa, we need your help.
The Britishers stole the statue
from the temple.
We can't lock horns with them.
I want you to steal it from them.
If you do it, we'll pay your price.
That statue is our dignity.
We need to retrieve it.
You secured it for 600 years...
but now the Crown stole it from you.
Dignity you say?
We'll retrieve it!
I will plan and inform you.
Until then, live without dignity.
They can't be trusted.
Miller sounds like a good deal.
A few Kings are out to help us.
A few Kings are barking
at the feet of Britishers.
Rajathipathi is not the barking breed...
but the one that bites.
Here's the information you asked for.
Anandha, the movement will get
a lot of funds.
Inform Vincent Pillai.
You overlook the process.
- Inform everyone to assemble.
- Sure!
A convoy of five vehicles
with the Britishers and Sepoys.
If I'm right, the statue...
must be in the middle vehicle.
We don't have enough men.
Neither enough ammunition.
What do you want from me?
We need thirty people.
Ten from our gang
and five from the movement.
I will send fifteen men
from my security detail.
- You?
- No!
I'm not coming.
The officers know me well.
I will send my men disguised
as village folks.
If we get caught
it won't be good for all of us.
You bring me the statue!
The King has asked me to
pay you one lakh rupees.
I will be waiting for you
with your money.
Pick the sharpest fifteen among our men.
After the job is done,
Eesa, Kuyili, and Ayyavoo...
kill them all!
Leave no trace behind.
Why didn't your King come along?
He spoke too much about respect
and dignity like a jerk.
He could've come along.
No one will notice.
Don't we wear masks during the loot?
Of course,
his life is more important to him.
Kaali, what about your life?
What if we kill you
and take away the statue?
A hungry lion finds prey.
But a pack of Hyenas are waiting
to steal that prey.
In that situation,
what if a wolf takes away the prey?
What will happen?
The pack of Hyenas and Lion
will tag along and hunt the wolf.
For one wolf, the entire lot
will turn into prey.
Like with the Kohinoor...
we are not stealing this stone.
We are simply claiming
what's rightfully ours.
The most powerful empire
on the face of the earth...
has amassed unimaginable wealth.
Taking what it deserves.
I expect our King will be rather pleased
with this fascinating little trinket.
Oh, God!
Dacoits!
Fire!
Hey, come on! Hurry up!
- Go! Go! Go!
- Go and get the Jeep.
Drive faster!
Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey, drive!
Hey, turn around the vehicle!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Wait...
I know who you are.
You're Miller!
A wanted with a price on your head...
for robbery and murder.
They'll find you, you know!
It doesn't matter where you hide.
They'll hunt you down!
But it just too happens...
I have the power to save you.
For I am the Governor's son!
You?
Governor's son, Riley?
Yes!
Yes!
I'll tell you a story.
One girl...
saved my life twice.
I wronged her.
I wronged that girl.
The girl asked me...
...for a thing.
Should I give it to her?
Yes, of course. You must!
Whatever she desires.
Your death!
Come on!
CEYLON
He betrayed us!
I should've told him when Kaali riddled me.
We are doing this for your village.
I made a mistake.
The village will be destroyed!
You couldn't even complete a small job.
Now we have to bow down to these morons.
You should shoot yourself.
The murder of the Governor's son
was a grave mistake.
For which those responsible
will pay dearly.
Our Kingdom is not responsible
in any way...
My...
General!
Ah, General!
It's Miller who killed Riley
and took the treasure away.
He belongs to that village.
And they may know where he might be.
There's another matter of
particular concern to The Crown.
Before we found out about it...
you'd been hiding from us
all the information
about this treasure and its origins.
General it's actually...
The village and the temple will now
become British property.
Mining will soon begin.
And we will find out exactly
what lies beneath.
Ayya, please spare me.
I don't know anything.
Please don't beat me.
Ayya, I don't know where Eesa is!
Please spare me.
Oh, no! Please don't beat me.
Ayya, please spare me.
We don't know anything.
- Ayya...
- We don't know where Eesa is.
Oh, God, no!
- Hey, tell me!
- Oh, God, help us!
Please don't beat me.
Ayya, it's hurting.
- It's hurting.
- Oh, no!
We don't know anything about Eesa.
- Oh, no!
- Where is Eesa?
Give me the cotton.
- My people are dying...
- Get in the front!
- I have to save them.
- Let me remove the bullet.
- Let go of me.
- Please bear with me.
- One minute. Let me put medicine.
- I have to save my people.
- You may go.
- I said let me go.
Hey! Hey, hold him.
Don't let him fall.
Maadu! Maadu!
- Oh, no!
- It's hurting!
- Oh, God, no!
- It's hurting.
We don't know anything.
Tell me where he is.
Ayya, please don't beat us.
Hey, sit down. I said sit down.
Sit down.
Please don't beat me.
Oh, no!
Tell me. I said tell me.
Alright, where's Miller?
Or Annaleesan
whatever the hell you people call him.
Where is Annaleesan?
Speak up!
Where is Annaleesan?
I'm going to kill one of you...
...every hour.
Until someone tells me where he is.
You all are going to die!
One life every hour.
If you wish to live...
Tell me, where is Annaleesan?
Alright, let's start with...
...him!
Come!
Ayya, please spare me.
Hey, tell me where he is.
Hey, sit down. Sit down!
Please spare us!
Hey, sit down!
We don't know anything.
Please spare us!
Ayya, I don't know anything.
Please spare me. I have a family.
Ayya!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Huh, this has been fun. Hasn't it?
It's too bloody hot, though.
I'll tell you what...
Let's make it half an hour.
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
The sound of the bullet...
The sound of the bullet...
...is music to my ears.
I'm happy!
Where is Annaleesan?
We're out of bullets, Kannaiya.
Our men are injured!
There should be another way
to stop them.
Kannaiya!
Don't worry about me.
I'm scared, Kannaiya.
I think I'll die out here.
All of you leave from here.
You people escape from here.
Alright, let's not waste time. Shall we?
The sooner you tell me.
The sooner all this bloody killing stops.
Once he gets the money.
He wanted to go to Ceylon.
He has to go via Dhanushkodi.
If you go there, you can capture him.
Alright, I'll stop the killing.
Go!
The fugitive is in
Dhanushkodi's old harbour.
I repeat.
The fugitive is in
Dhanushkodi's old harbour.
Over!
[Pechiamma]Many attempted to steal it.
But failed.
Hundreds of years passed...
neither the stone nor the temple
lost its value.
But the people who built the temple...
are considered not worthy enough
to enter it.
Whenever injustice strikes...
At that time, Koranar appears...
and saves the people
is a belief of our people.
- Pechiamma.
- What?
We have information
that Sengannan is arriving.
He is coming.
Your dear son is arriving.
Well, now no one can stop your atrocities.
Go! Go and take a shower.
She's blabbering, and you're listening
to her horror stories.
She's spinning stories.
Get up and leave!
Hey, get lost!
Koranar will appear and save the people,
it seems.
Why should we pray to God?
Anyway, we are not allowed
inside the temple.
God did not appear out of nowhere
from the sky.
Oh-oh!
It's omnipresent among us.
It's like Ayyanar and Koranar.
It's a tribute to them.
Is this the time for it?
The King and the Prince
are already making trouble.
Why do we need this celebration
at the moment?
Ah... let them come.
If they come here, I'll kill them myself.
- Yeah, right!
- My dear!
You're looking good!
Anna! Pechiamma, Sengannan is here.
- Come on. Off you go!
- He has arrived.
How are you, Anna?
- I'm good. How are you?
- I'm good!
- This is for Aandiappan..
- He is here.
- Mother.
- Welcome, my son.
My dear son.
I'm not saying
what you're doing is wrong.
But you're always away from home.
Please visit often.
With the universe throbbing
and earth-shaking
Here appears Koranar!
Son, please put some sense
into your brother's head.
Ayya, Koranar!
- Eesa!
- Sengannan!
Not bad you remember my name.
Are you trying to guilt-trip me?
I'm happy that you came home.
Why don't you stay back?
The old lady will be happy too.
She's not keeping well.
But she hides it well from everyone.
She's spinning horror stories
and fooling people.
You forgot about family
and gave yourself to the country.
You've grown up.
Of course!
This is what happens
when you don't visit often.
Let's go!
Listen...
In this old age,
the mother shares her beliefs with others.
Why do you want to discourage her?
I won't discourage. Let's go!
- Mother will be happy.
- Fine, I'll come.

I mean, Prince!
Instead of celebrating with liquor
you're drowning in smoke.
Hey, stop ranting like a moron!
They came here to make a living.
I wanted to chase them away.
But now they're building a temple.
A good clerk understands your woes
without being told.
Sengolan, who is wanted
by the Britishers...
is going to be present
at the temple building festival.
I informed the Police about it.
Also, I sent some of our men with them.
Let's watch how they are going
to build a temple.

Oh, no, Sengola, run!
Come on, run!
Oh, God!
Oh, no, Amma. Pechiamma.
Eesa, take care of Amma.
You go, Anna.
I will take care of her.
They went this way.
Come with me!
Dear, I want to see my son.
Hey, Eesa... Sengola!
I want to see Sengola!
- My son...
- Pechiamma!
I want to see my son.
I want to see my son.
I want to see Eesa, too!

Oh, no, Pechiamma.
Pechiamma left us.

Oh, God...
Eesa, God shows no mercy.
Also, our Koranar has no regard for us.
Your mother left you, Eesa!
My dear son!
Oh, God, no!
Pechiamma!
Why do you look like you saw a ghost?
What did you see?
Step aside.
Miller, we received a message
from Kannaiya.
He needs guns and ammunition.
We are going.
- How could you do this, Miller?
- Manimaara...
- You don't know...
- Bring me the boxes.
the people from your village
are tied to this job.
When the King's men came to see you...
It was Ayyavoo who brought them.
He asked me not to tell you.
Because of you
the village will be destroyed.
When you were escaping with your beloved
during the temple carnival...
it was Eesa who helped you with his life.
I don't know what came over him...
This is not the Eesa I grew up with.
Hey! Do you recognize him?
He was here...
The name of the place...
The name of the place...
It's at the tip of my tongue.
The name of the place...
It was a nice name!
Ceylon! He went to Ceylon!
The fugitive has escaped.
I repeat, the fugitive has escaped.
- Over!
- Copy! Over and out!
- Sir...
- So he has escaped. Has he?
Yes sir!
It's going to be a lovely day.

Where is Kanagasabai?
The pigs caught him!
Aren't you ashamed to say this?
I don't know why I am raising you all
for no good.
Just like we killed her father...
I will kill the wretch, too.
Our men...
Go!
You're trying to scare us?
You listen to me, Miller!
Lay down your weapons.
We'd like a peaceful surrender.
And if you don't...
General Wandy will come
with a huge fleet of 700 men.
And you won't stand a chance.
I'm warning you, Miller.
Surrender yourself now.
You...
believe...
...in Devil?
I am the Devil!
And you will call me...
Captain Miller!
No! Miller no!
No!
No!
Where are the Sepoys?
They are 100 miles away...
in Veeravanallur.
You have insulted Andrew Wandy.
Not just to capture you...
but to destroy the entire village
he'll come with 700 sepoys.
As far as he's here
we will keep getting into trouble.
They came looking for him.
He has to surrender himself.
Hey! If he surrenders?
Didn't you hear what the Sepoy said?
They're not coming here just for Eesa.
But they're following the King's orders
to destroy us.
It's not safe for the villagers
to stay here.
We need to move them elsewhere.
Ayya, why should we leave town?
If we step out of this place...
that Rajathipathi will acquire
the entire place.
We were born here.
We lived here.
And our deaths will be on this soil.
Ayya, he's missing!
Was it you who killed General Buller?
Do you know what Captain Rafi
told us about you?
You were the first to
stand up against it and have
the courage to leave the military.
You take our men outside
and stand guard.
I shall go, too.
I can't trust them.
When I get an opportunity...
I will kill him with my own hands.
Please hear me out.
I understand how you
and the villagers feel.
But we need a place to stay.
The huts are all burned down.
Everyone is hungry.
There are no medicines.
What will we do if the Britishers return?
We need a safe place for the people.
Make arrangements.
There's a secret door behind the temple.
I can access that door and open it.
But someone has to distract the men
guarding in the front.
I will take the people of the movement
and your men inside.
I will prepare our men.
Last time when you were in the temple,
they tried to kill you.
I'll send Thenpasiyar along with you.
I've faced the unthinkable.
I learned how to survive and escape.
I'm not stopping you.
You don't have to enter first.
If you're feeling guilty
I'll suggest a way to overcome it.
It's not just your sin to bear.
Many have the right over it.
You cannot do anything about it.
You were in the group
that shot down my husband.
I don't believe that your bullet
killed him.
This is it!
Up! We have to climb up.
I have something you want.
But in return, we need one favour.
What?
Hey, check who's out there.
It would help if you allowed my people
inside the temple to get to safety.
You can step inside the temple
only over my dead body.
Fire!
Hey!
I'm not avenging my father's death.
If I don't kill you.
You'll destroy this village.
Kaali!
Are you resenting?
Die with resentment!
Eesa, are we allowed near God?
No God has mentioned
that you can not.
I need your help.
Also, I need your men.
Finally, the statue is out.
Everyone must be eyeing the statue.
The man from Andaman
must be on his way.
What is it?
What happened?
Our soldiers have been captured
and held hostage.
Well, move it!
Come on, faster boys!
Faster dammit!
Why are you here?
Go to the temple.
Kannaiya didn't raise me this way.
The Britishers are arriving!

Fire!
Hey!
Do you know what Captain Rafi
told us about you?
- Hey, get him to safety.
- Come on, run!
Go!
Get away from here!
Go away!
FIRE!
- Go inside!
- Everyone go inside.
- Everyone get inside.
- Go inside.
Drag him inside.
Sengola!
It's time you come out of hiding.
They are going to burn down
Mathalamparai.
A brave warrior should listen
to his heart.
The price on my head is 10,000 rupees.
I wonder how much is the price
on your head.
The price does not matter to me.
I'm worried about how they will
sketch my face on the poster.
For Sembattai!
We listened to what the heart
had to say, Eesa.
But we locked horns with the devil.
They won't spare us!
You said I don't have the right to
speak about mother.
Since then, I've been experiencing
a severe pain, Eesa!
Just because I came to the festival...
the guilty pain of our mother's demise.
Whenever I arrive...
the pain I bring along with me.
Also, the pain...
that I cannot keep our mother
and this village happy.
Sengannan, please forget about it.
After 600 years, our people
have stepped inside the temple.
Isn't that what mother wanted too?
Ayya, Koranar Ayya...
Our ancestors made a figurine of Koranar
with the Gemstone...
and gifted it to the King.
They say that the gemstone is still
hidden somewhere within the Kingdom.
Ayya, Koranar Ayya!
Koranar Ayya!
- Ayya! Koranar Ayya!
- Please save us.
Have you taken the form of Eesan
to come and save us all?
With the universe throbbing
and earth-shaking...
Here appears Koranar!
They may believe it's a lie
But stories say otherwise
Brave Koranar will shine light on us
That will fetch us a permanent victory
against the enemy
Ayya, Koranar Ayya!
You're the guardian of my clan.
For generations, we longed
to see you at least once.
To save this village and its people...
you took the form of Annaleesan.
Who killed him?
Young Princess Velmathi...
She joined hands with the village folks...
then killed our King and the Prince.
I could not believe it.
Betrayal! Betrayal!
Does Kandhiya know about it?
He must have received the news.
