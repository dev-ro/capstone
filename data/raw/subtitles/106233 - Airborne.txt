Oh, Slash, your pooch!
What have you been doing?
Hunting cats or looking bone?
Hey Mom.

Okay, is it?
Who's died?
Come here, sweetie,

Peace, sweetheart, peace.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Goosen.

A true gentleman.
Who would have thought?
So who would

Thank you, Molly.
My name is Molly Ryans.
I have 3.8 overall average.
I am treasurer of Amnesty International.
And I'll ever be a successful judge.
Close?
My name is Snake.
I do not like Oratory.
I never even wrote me up to this.
I have no hobby unless
collecting knives and scratch portfolios
with names of guys who do not like.
I have 1.1 overall average.
I refuse to lower myself wearing a jeans
tight just to please a  macho-man </ i>
One day Jimbo will be a
sports commentator.
Look.
I want to be a personal slave
Al Paccino.
Jose Augusto Raphael de la To.
Everyone calls me Augie.
I like...

You used to beat me ... I forgive you.
Anyway...
if you really want to know
Wiley Mets who is
I am Hockey.
I live to play hockey and
I play hockey for a living.
It's all I do. Hockey is my life.
I'm using a hockey underwear
right now.
Hockey is very personal. My dad
He drives a Zamboni and gave me a puck.
And the new guy, Mr. Cauley?
I think it's his turn.
Okay, Mitchell.
Mitchell Goosen, at your service.
I'm not here.
Well, you know.
I have no stories. I do not want to know
I will be because I do not care.
As long as living close to the beach
and has not to wear tie
then yes, I will be  styling. </ i>
Sty ... styling? What is this?
Let me tell you
what is styling.
It is the perfect section.
Wave after wave, leading to the beach.
Splashing in your face. Small movements
attack, and a perfect 360 °.
I'm saying, no lie friends,
It is the awakening of consciousness.
I am gonna puke.
- What is consciousness?
- Do not know.
Other than that, I do not know ...
Give me a granola bar and burritos,
perhaps not too spicy
I will be a happy peasant.
I have something to say, please?
I think the cute caiçara here

Does anyone here believe that ... stuck Chat
of L.A. he's counting?
I do not buy it.
Your little fruit.
The soldier did what straight
Your boss sent.

I just said ... like Augie
speaks well in public.
I'll bet.
Cute.
Surfer.
Right Jack.
You're next.
Do you really think surf
is sport, is not it?
It is not.
It shuttlecock ... checkers game.
It's to get a tan.
Want to try a real sport?
Why not try hockey?
Actually ... today we have a game
against Preparatory School.
We never won the  Preps. </ I>
And I will not graduate as a loser.
When no one else did,
we'll get today.
Let's kick the rear of Preps!
For Rosenblatt!
Next Thursday.
Thank you for cooperation.
You go to the game?
Never been to a hockey game.
You will love it, man.
Its very cool.
And you, caiçara?
You go to the game?
Brou relaxes, lets quiet.
He called you in any piece
underwear?
Hey, Mitchell.
You make friends easily
so where are you going?
You do what?
Tryin to see how many
enrages you in one day?
I think it was  Gandhi </ i> who said
Make waves, not war.
Hi Mitchell.
As you are, girls?
We want to welcome
the Cincinatti.
Thanks girls.
Wiley and I are cousins.
- If you need anything
- If you need anything
...just call me.
... call us.
Thank you.
Hey surfer ... care.
This is the girlfriend of Jack.
We were just showing the Mitchel
a little hospitality.
Hi, you're a love.
You know, beast, you will learn.
I will do everyone a favor,
save time and kick your ass
right now.
Teaching not with Mecher
trespassing.
We were just talking, brah.
This is ... He said again.
I'll kill him.
- Hey Jack!
Guess what?
- What?
Rich and Freddy were caught kidding
Mrs. coffee. Crowney.
- I think it will be a long detention.
- They can not come to the game.
- All right, we arrange someone.
- Who we will call?
The figure skating staff?
- And the mess that will be?
- I play.
It's right.
You're inside.
We are still one less,
because...
You.
- Who?
- You.
- I?
- Yup.
- No.
- Yup.
Where do I know you from?
Class Oratory. You used
get my head in the toilet.
- Willy?
- Wiley.
Whatever.
Will play hockey today.
Ah cool! Uh, Tuesday, right?
I can not, I ... dentist.
Channel problem,
the root're appearing ...
- Will play.

Snake takes, takes.
Snake will.
We Wiley. It is the face of hockey?
Hockey warrior?
Only on Nintendo!
Jack can come!
- You are lucky, huh?
- Do you think it is not Blane?
- Looking at all other
defeats, I think even luck.
I seek your self-esteem and just
I see defeat, defeat.
They are already getting used,
is not Blane?
Wants to chat or play hockey?
The first to do 3 wins, Blane.
VISITORS 01 X 02 CENTRAL
Wiley will, kick the rear
these Preps.
I will kill you!
- I think you're popular.
- People's too much.
Those girls still going to kill me.
Dead?
See that guy, No. 2?
His name is Jack.
And that's his girlfriend.
But it seems not, because she
does not act as such.
And it's not
afraid of him, are you?
Do not.
I've seen a lot like him.
The more scream,
most are harmless.
Oh yes?
You see the look of them?
It is war.
Sometimes you have to fight to win, right?
- No need to go that far.
I do not know, but I think you do not need
fight to achieve anything.
Anything?
I once knew a guy who always
fought by the waves.
When someone got close, I would go
up like crazy and drove away.
No matter the face size,
the blockhead was not even there.
One day I was behind a boy
Morey-boogie, nervous to be in your wave.
I thought:  I will teach a lesson to this kid.
I'll scare him. </ I>
Then it went up but came so close
that the board hit him in the head.
I had blood everywhere.
The boy began to drown ...
- He was good?
- Yes, but with a scar on his head.
What happened to the surfer?
I'm living in Cincinnati.
You know, it's funny.
You're so worried by the fighting
wave that loses the chance to enjoy the sea.
Life is too short for that.
Since it is not fight, what do you like?
- I like the smell of the sea.
... the color of the setting sun and
surfing in the rain.
- You are a poet.
- No, I just know what I like.
I think you like what's cool.
We are talking and
not even know your name.
- Nikki.
- I'm Mitchell Goosen.
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too, Mitchell Goosen.
VISITORS 02 X 02 CENTRAL
Cool, now we have one less.
All right, we play with five.
Hey, the kid from California
can complete.
Okay.
You're in, surfer.
Who did this uniform?
Here ... here ...
VISITORS 03 X 02 CENTRAL
- Very good.
- I did not know it was our team.
It's the wrong goal.
- Sorry, man.
- Excuse? We lost the game.
See ... what you did was ... it was ...
Great!! It was fantastic!!
Beautiful shot!
Surfer,
see you at school.
Mitchell?
Slash your pooch.
- No, it's me, your cousin Wiley.
I thought I was dead.
Are you okay?
It was really cool, Wiley.
Remember to invite me next time.
Come, I'll help you.
- They will kill us.
- Do not kill for lost hockey game.
- You do not know these guys, believe me.
- Come on, Wiley?
- You lost the game, Mr. Goal.
- All right, whatever.
Are you limping?
O Lord, in the name of Buddha,
what happened to you?
- Playing hockey, mom.
- Hockey? My Little Wiley plays hockey?
Did you hear that Louie?
Now are hockey players?
Mitchell, I have shown my prize
 Zamboni Driver of the year </ i>?
- Not now, Father.
OK?
Hockey! Father, we have to buy
him a trophy.
- I have a puck.
- Not a puck, a trophy.
- First you have to win a game.
- It is good to dream, is not the father?
I sô as playful.
- I realized I was playing.
Wiley, let's go.
Will be all right.
See, I told you.
Nothing will happen to us.
We'll be just fine.
Mitchell, how are you?
Sorry about yesterday.
Tahi I said.
Hey, how are you guys?
-. <I> Buenos dias </ i>
- Hey, Snake,  Buenos dios </ i>
Mitchell!
Hey whats up?
- Nikki, how are you?
Oh no, here comes trouble. I do not want you
involved, then I'll have me, okay?
Very good, Wiley. 're Almost there.
- Nice.
Turn left at the traffic lights.
Very good, no?
Come back here.
- It appears that way, Wiley.
- You're jumpy.
- Being chased by psychopaths?
Yes, I'm nervous.
- At least not put powder-monkey
in his underwear. Yeah unbearable.
I hope the cats do not have
I noticed scratching all day.
- It's not exactly what
will do my best day.
- Can not last forever, right?
- Come on, man.
I need transit, breeze, waves.
At least one burrito, my God.
I need the ocean. I can not stand it anymore.
- Calm down, man.
Neither the  E.T. </ I> want to go
both home like me.
I need to get out of here.
- Can we go to the market and lead
you want my mom cook.
- Not exactly what I had
in mind, Wiley.
- Which was? You do not want to bring something different?
Mom is very flexible with food.
Mitchell?
Louie, come quickly is Mitchell.
Oh Jesus, Mary or Joseph, 190.
Do not be ... do not overdose overdose.
Aunt Irene ...
Oh my love...
Do not ever do this with
Your Uncle Louie again.
- I was just resting.
- I think it was drugged.
- No, I'm just tired.
- You will pass out or something?
- No, I just had a hard day.
- Oh, I was already forgetting.
We received a card from their parents.
His father was intoxicated
with the food.
And it received a large package
I laid on the bed.
What is it?
- Something that should never have forgotten.
Nikki!
Are you okay?
How are you?
I am fine.
How are you?
It was just a little upset,
nothing much.
You have to be more careful with this.
Dangerous if not know how to use.
I will be more careful
hereafter. Thank you.
What are you doing now?
Is not it beautiful?
- It's like another world.
Really.
It's my ocean.
Come here.
I want to show you some flowers.
This is definitely
My favorite.
Ah,  lilies </ i>.
Very pretty.
Come on, you know lilies?
- Think live on the board?
- Yup.
Yeah right, you live.
But my parents are encyclopedias
street Biology.
Well then...
This one.
 Cleopatra earrings. </ i>
Impressive.
You will never know this.
Come here.
This one.
What are you doing?
 Ginger. </ i>
Very good.
She loves plenty of water.
It looks like me.
This one you have to see.
Right here.
Mitchell?
Gotcha.
Could not leave
pass is perfect.
Will make us
be expelled from here.
Hey, wait a minute.
You are crazy.
You know, you are the first smile
I see in three weeks.
Thank you.
Been on the beach
seeing the setting of the sun?
I've never been on the beach.
One day you have to go to L.A.
see the sunset.
You should feel much
lack of home, right?
Not now.
- Good Guy?
Can I talk to you for a second?
I had a great day today.
We can do it again.
I know a great restaurant.
Good food and always packed.
We can have fun.
For me're great.
How about Friday?
OK.
It's my bus.
I forgot it was going to the city
with Wiley Friday night.
Bring him too.
I do not know if he can
pack company in time.
Can I bring a friend.
Nice.
Okay, well ...
bye Mitchell Goosen.
I'm starting to like Cincinnati.
Nice.
Hey, how's my best
and one cousin?
Why're so happy, brah?
- It's called love, brah.
Hey, look at the water.
What is her name?
- Nikki.
I have a date with her
Friday night.
- We agreed to go out Friday night.
- I got one for you too.
You did what?
I arranged a meeting?
It's nice to be nice and say  yes </ i>.
I had several proposals to Friday.
It's nice to have beautiful eyes
... and beautiful teeth.
South Bay
South Africa.
No one around, no cameras,
without sponsors.
Only the Goos ...
... and the wave.
And that perfect wave.
Fast, large and spattering
as a washing machine.
Even more because it is in Cincinnati.
That's right, Cincinnati.
Never done before.
Ei Mitchell!
Você acha que a Gloria vai
gostar do visual de um cara
rebelde sem causa que anda
à margem da sociedade?
É o jeito que você se veste
todo dia?
Tudo bem, Sr. Espertão.
Sr. Sabe Tudo.
Me ajude com a roupa.
Vamos ver o que você tem.
Você não é meu primo.
Ah, qual é?
Eu desisto.
Popeye, taí um grande cara.
Sabe por quê?
Nunca entrou para o
Clube dos Cabeludos.
Errado.
Porque seu lema era
" Eu sou o que sou ".
Acha que Popeye alguma vez se preocupou
com roupa para conquistar Olívia Palito ?
Devo dizer que não, parceiro.
E quer saber por quê?
Ele era gay.
Porque ele é o que é.
Olá...
...Gloria, sou Wi...Wiley...
...como vai?
Po...posso dirigir.
- Que tal dar uma volta
no píer antes de jantar?
- Parece legal pra mim.
- É isso aí, já que tenho
Carteira de Habilitação.
- Que legal, não?
- Só precisou de três tentativas.
- Isso acontece.
Aqui vamos nós.
Só checando os comandos.
De quem era aquele carro?
Se pudesse almoçar com apenas
três pessoas do mundo inteiro
vivas, mortas ou fictícias.
Não importa. Quem seriam?
- Que tipo de pergunta é essa?
- Só uma brincadeira, vai.
Bem, devo dizer Tom Curtis, maior
surfista vivo, seria legal.
E... talvez Ghandi. Mas não pra
almoço pois ele não come nada.
- E a terceira?
- Seria você.
Eu?
Pode almoçar com qualquer pessoa
no mundo e você me escolhe.
- Você não é qualquer pessoa.
Você é especial.
Então...
Costuma vir sempre ao píer?
Ah, sim... aqui tem
uma linda atmosfera e...
pessoalmente...
- O melhor lado do píer é pra lá.
Você precisa ver aquele lado...
- Com fome?
- Morrendo.
Pessoal?
Podemos ir pois...
Gloria está com fome.
Muito.
Acho que ela gostou de mim, cara.
Além do mais, ela sabe a letra de
You ate my train
de Jenny Young, cara.
É ótima e ela gosta.
Acho que nem professores
são tão chatos.
Todo estranho.
- Ele está um pouco nervoso.
- Ele tá nervoso?
Achei que ia morrer quando quase
bateu naquele caminhão de gasolina.
Por pouco não viramos asfalto.
- Ele vai mudar seu conceito.
- Não nesta vida.
...foi muito estranho.
Não falei que aqui seria legal?
Eu amo este lugar, é meu favorito.
Eu praticamente vivo aqui.
Queriam por um sofá lá trás
pra eu poder dormir por aqui.
Engraçado pois eu nunca
te vi por aqui antes.
Venho sempre às terças.
- Mesmo?
Sento nos fundos... com o dono.
Venho tarde, bem tarde.
Ei galera, não se importam de Walter
e eu nos sentarmos, não é?
Blane, dá o fora daqui.
- Veja, parece que Nikki arranjou
um novo amiguinho.
Parceiro, na boa, o que tá
rolando aqui é particular.
Vocês entendem, não?
O que acha de sairmos outra hora
e jogar boliche, talvez?
Eu gosto de boliche mas não quero
ir embora, Blane. Temos que ir?
- Ir? Antes de agradecer nossa estrela
por ter ajudado a ganhar o jogo?
Seria falta de educação.
Entendo o que quer dizer, brou.
Obrigado pelas palavras e Adeus.
- Garotos, façam alguma coisa.
- Por que não nos deixam em paz?
O que acham de sairmos daqui?
- Boa idéia.
- Finalmente.
Me solta Blane.
- Calma cara, não há motivo pra
começarmos uma briga.
- Cala boca, não tá vendo que
estou dançando com a Gloria?
- Meu, deixe ela em paz, tá certo?
Vai, solta ela.
- Vai implorar perdão?
- Você escutou, cara.
- Ainda não ouvi cabeça de cenoura.
- Você escutou, Blane.
Então vou ter que te machucar.
Venha aqui.
Não sente a minha falta?
Mitchell!
- Solta ela.
- Se liga, isso não tem
nada a ver com você.
- Fique longe da minha irmã.
E eu não vou falar de novo.
- Deixe ela decidir, Jack.
- Ela já decidiu.
Agora cai fora daqui!
Ainda não acabou, Jack.
- Você tá bem?
- Sim... tô bem.
- Vamos, te dou uma carona.
- Não preciso de carona, Jack.
Estou aqui com...
Tá certo, o Caiçara é seu par.
Legal, vamos embora.
- Jack, isso não é decisão sua.
- Que acha de sentarmos e discutirmos
isso, comendo umas batatas-fritas?
- Que acha de eu pegar a cesta de
batatas e te enfiar goela abaixo?
- Pare Jack.
- Calma Jack, relaxa.
Eu vou levar você pra casa Nikki.
- Jack, quer parar de agir como
um estúpido Homem-das-cavernas?
Já disse que estou aqui com o Mitchell.
- Ela vai ficar numa boa, Jack.
Eu levo ela de manhã cedo
pra casa.
- Tudo pra você é piada, cara?
- E tudo pra você é tão sério?
Ela vai ficar bem, ouça sua
consciência, meu camarada.
Eu vou levar Nikki pra casa.
E não há nada que possa fazer.
Tá entendendo, surfista?
- O que acha que sou?
Algum idiota.
Eu sei o que você quer, Jack.
Tá fazendo isso a 3 semanas.
Querendo que eu entre no seu jogo.
Odeio acabar com a sua graça, mas
não vou brigar com você Jack, não vou.
- Ele tá com medo, Jack.
- Ele não tá com medo de nada.
- É verdade?
É verdade que tá com medo, cara?
Tá com medo de mim?
Acha que bancando o fortão, me colocando
apelidos e enchendo meu armário de areia
vai fazer eu brigar com você?
Você não tem idéia de quem eu sou, pois
não dou a mínima pra você, sua escola
ou seu jogo de hóquei.
Vou embora em 3 meses e acha
que vou perder meu tempo com você
ou com qualquer outra pessoa?
Você não vale a pena, brou.
Ninguém aqui vale. Ninguém.
Nikki!
Gloria, quer carona?
Acho que sim.
Espere aí, parceiro.
Pare, tá legal.
Pare com essa coisa de parceiro.
Achava que surfistas eram valentes.
- O que queria que fizesse?
Brigar com todos eles e virar herói?
Sim. Ter feito algo seria melhor
do que sair sem fazer nada.
- O que isso resolveria? Nada.
Sei porque costumava pensar que sim.
- E a Nikki?
Você deixou ela ir.
- Deixei ela ir?
Ela fugiu de mim.
Além do mais você não me disse
que ela era irmã do Jack.
- Eu não sabia.
- Não importa, cara.
Qual é o problema?
Eu vou embora em alguns meses.
Você realmente me decepciona, cara.
Nikki?
Preciso falar com você.
Não enche, ok?
Não importa.
- Você não me deu chance de explicar.
- Sei, você vai embora em alguns meses
então não vale a pena.
- Não foi o que eu quis dizer.
Não importa, porque sabe de uma coisa
você tá certo, não vale mesmo a pena.
Wiley!
Acorda cara, acorda.
Tenho que te dizer uma coisa.
Levanta, levanta.
Eu tive um sonho... tinha uma onda...
não dessas de tamanho normal
era uma grande, enorme, tipo,
daquelas que não terá outra chance
Como eclipse solar.
Tava curtindo ela, no maior styling.
Até que eu vi um tubarão,
tipo muito grande mesmo.
E seu nome era Pepe
- Pepe?
Pepe. E começou a vir pra cima de mim.
Mas então ele parou.
Me olhou nos olhos e disse em espanhol
" La ola ès mia "
Eu falava espanhol no meu sonho, cara,
pois na hora entendi o que tava dizendo.
" A onda é minha "
Daí eu acordei.
- Me acordou às 3 por um sonho besta?
- Tá brincando? Tudo que precisamos
saber tá em nossos sonhos, cara.
São janelas para o conhecimento.
- Então, o que este tubarão
Pepe significa pra você?
- É óbvio que Jack é o tubarão
e Nikki é a onda.
E ele não me quer perto da sua irmã.
La ola ès mia
A onda é minha.
Então o que ele faz?
Ele vem pra cima de mim como um tubarão.
Tá tentando me assustar pra ficar
longe da onda, cara!
- A questão é?
- É que quando você tem a onda perfeita
ou qualquer coisa perfeita você vai atrás.
Você não se preocupa se tem um tubarão
quase mordendo seu traseiro,
pois sempre haverá tubarões.
Mas quando aparecerá outra onda
perfeita como essa?
- O que significa?
Vai brigar com Jack?
- E jogar Gandhi em seu túmulo?
Acho que não.
Além do mais, não é preciso brigar com
o tubarão pra lutar pela onda...
Vamos Wiley.
- Vai na frente. Não se preocupe.
Eu eu tô legal.
Tudo por causa do Pepe.
- O que ele tá fazendo aqui?
- Podemos conversar?
- Não.
- E quando poderemos?
Depois do jogo... depois do jogo.
- Jack, ele não tá pensando
em jogar, tá?
- Não sei o que ele acha, mas
é melhor ir embora.
- Jack, não é melhor o verme jogar?
- Pra quê?
- Se deixar ele jogar, podemos ver
ele ser chutado.
- É mesmo, gostei disso, cara.
- E aí pessoal, tem lugar pra mais um?
- Travis, você tá fora.
- Adios garoto da Califórnia.
- Caras, vocês tem um... taco?
- Não pare aqui, cara.
- Pega eles, surfista.
- Isso.
- Muito bom.
- Vai atrás dele, Mitchel!
- Pega ele, cara.
- Vai cara.
- Soca ele, a gente tá aqui.
- Um soco, vai.
Seu franguinho.
- Ele vai chorar, Blane?
- Vamos, me acerte.
- Deixa Blane, tô vendo ele chorar.
Tá vindo uma lágrima.
- O que há de errado com você?
Por que não fez nada?
Por que evitou enfrentar
esses caras de novo?
Mitchel? Olá?
Sai fora!
- Tá todo borrado!
- Que foi Blane?
- É a Fábrica de chocolate?
- Muito engraçado.
- Peguem ele.
Vai logo.
- Você tava certa, existem coisas que
devemos brigar para conseguir.
- Vai.
- Não antes de te contar meu sonho.
- Não, vai.
- Os carros, tirem os carros!
- Tirem os carros!
Os carros!
Caras, vocês estão na casa certa?
- Sim, o Mitchell tá aí?
Sim... entrem...
Su cosa ès mi cosa.
Snake, Augie, Mark, Tony...
E aí Rosenblat?
Vocês devem ser os amiguinhos do Wiley.
Pai, os amiguinhos do Wiley.
- O... oi...
- Ele fala de vocês o tempo todo.
- Meninos, vocês gostariam de algo
pra comer?
- Não, obrigado senhora.
- Então...
Pai, vamos fazer um pouco de pipoca.
- E que... eu tô assistindo...
- Vamos, não podemos demorar o dia todo.
- Eles vieram te ver.
- Pessoal?
- Não sabia que andava tão bem, cara.
- Você é muito bom.
- Nunca ri tanto em toda a minha vida.
- Acho que entendemos você errado.
Caramba, cara. Me desculpe.
- Tá legal, já foi. Não se preocupe.
- Mesmo? Legal.
- Se liga, cara, tem uma coisa. Fomos desafiados
pelos Preps para uma corrida de patins
pra acabar com isso de uma vez por todas.
E eu... nós queremos que você entre no time.
Nos ajudar.
O que me diz?
- Onde é a corrida?
- Espinha do Diabo.
- Teremos mais chance se
estiver com a gente.
- O que é a Espinha do Diabo?
- Só é a ladeira mais perigosa
de toda a cidade.
O último cara que tentou descer
se quebrou tanto que esqueceu quem era.
Eu vi, foi pino na cabeça e tudo...
- De qualquer forma é uma descida e tanta.
Muito perigosa.
- E por que fazer isso?
- Porque estamos cansados de ser zuados.
- Tratados como lixo.
- Perdedores.
- Somos alguém e esta é nossa chance de
provar. Mas só conseguiremos sendo um time.
O que você diz, tá dentro ou não?
- Tudo isso por causa de um tubarão
chamado Pepe, hein?
- O que você tá fazendo?
- Tô me aprontando.
- Wiley, eu... não...
Eu sei, eu sei...
Jack, as regras são:
não há regras, vale tudo.
Por que não começamos a corrida?
Por que não começamos a corrida?
O primeiro time a cruzar 3 na
linha de chegada vence.
Pare Blane, sai fora.
Me larga.
Me larga.
Calma...
Venha Mitchell, segura!
Te lanço, vamos.
Vai cara!
Cabaços
Pra onde eles foram?
- Esse cara é muito rápido.
- Mas temos dois a um agora.
Mais um Prep e eles vencem.
Vamos Jack, temos uma corrida
pra vencer.
Vamos lá.
Sabe o Popeye... é um grande cara.
Ele...

Mitchell Hey!
Do you think Gloria will
like the look of a guy
rebel without a cause walking
the margins of society?
It's the way you dress
everyday?
All right, Mr. Espertão.
Mr. Know It All.
Help me with the laundry.
Let's see what you have.
You're not my cousin.
Ah, what is?
I quit.
 Popeye </ i>, Tai a great guy.
Do you know why?
He never entered the
Club Hairy.
Wrong.
Because his motto was
 "I am what I am." </ i>
You Think Popeye ever bothered
with clothes to win  Olive Oyl </ i>?
I say no, mate.
And you know why?
He was gay.
Because it is what it is.
Hello...
... Gloria, I am Wi ... Wiley ...
...How are you?
Po ... I can drive.
- How about a stroll
the pier before dinner?
- Sounds good to me.
- That's it, since I have
Driver's License.
- That's cool, right?
- Only he needed three attempts.
- It happens.
Here we go.
Just checking commands.
Whose was that car?
If you could have lunch with only
three people worldwide
living, dead or fictitious.
Does not matter. Who would?
- What kind of question is that?
- Just a joke, go.
Well, I must say  Tom Curtis </ i>, most
live surfer, would be cool.
And ... maybe  Gandhi </ i>. But not for
lunch because he does not eat anything.
- And the third?
- Would you.
I?
You can have lunch with anyone
in the world and you choose me.
- You are not anyone.
You are special.
So...
Usually always come to the pier?
Oh, yeah ... here I am
a lovely atmosphere and ...
personally ...
- The best pier side is over there.
You need to see that side ...
- Hungry?
- Dying.
Staff?
We can go for ...
Gloria is hungry.
Much.
I think she liked me, man.
Furthermore, she knows the words to
 You ate my train </ i>
 Jenny Young </ i>, man.
It's great and she likes.
I think that neither teachers
They are so boring.
All strange.
- He's a little nervous.
- He's nervous?
I thought I would die when almost
hit that gas truck.
We almost turned asphalt.
- It will change your view.
- Not in this lifetime.
... it was very strange.
Did not I say here would be cool?
I love this place, it's my favorite.
I practically live here.
They wanted for a pull back there
so you can sleep here.
Funny because I never
seen you here before.
I have been always on Tuesdays.
- Really?
Sit in the back ... with the owner.
I come late, very late.
Hey guys, do not mind Walter
and you sit down, do you?
Blane, get the hell out of here.
- See, it seems that Nikki arranged
a new little friend.
Partner, good, what're
going on here is private.
You understand, right?
What do you think we left another time
and bowling, perhaps?
I like bowling but do not want
go, Blane. We have to go?
- Go? Before thanking our star
for helping to win the game?
It would be impolite.
I understand what you mean, brah.
Thanks for the words and Goodbye.
- Boys, do something.
- Why do not they leave us alone?
What do you think we left here?
- Good idea.
- At least.
Let me go Blane.
- Calm face, there is no reason to
start a fight.
- Shut up, will you not see that
I'm dancing with Gloria?
- Man, leave her alone, okay?
Go and loose it.
- You will beg forgiveness?
- Did you hear, man.
- I have not heard head carrot.
- Did you hear, Blane.
So I will have to hurt you.
Come here.
Do not miss me?
Mitchell!
- She Solta.
- Get a grip, this has not
nothing to do with you.
- Stay away from my sister.
And I will not speak again.
- Let her decide, Jack.
- She's already decided.
Now get out of here!
Not over, Jack yet.
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Come on, give you a ride.
- I do not need a ride, Jack.
I'm here with ...
All right, the Caiçara is your match.
Cool, let's go.
- Jack, this is not your decision.
- Why not sit down and discuss
So eating some french fries?
- What do not you take the basket
potatoes and you shove down our throats?
- Stop Jack.
- Calm Jack, relax.
I'll take you home Nikki.
- Jack wants to stop acting like
a stupid man-of-caves?
I said I'm here with Mitchell.
- She'll be a good, Jack.
I take it early in the morning
home.
- Everything's a joke to you, man?
- And all for you is so serious?
She'll be fine, listen to your
consciousness, my buddy.
I'll take Nikki home.
And there's nothing you can do.
Do you understand, surfer?
- What do you think I am?
Some idiot.
I know what you want, Jack.
I'm doing it to 3 weeks.
Wanting me to come into your game.
I hate to break with his grace, but
I will not fight you Jack, I will not.
- He's scared, Jack.
- He're not afraid of anything.
- Is true?
It is true that're scared, man?
Are you afraid of me?
You think playing the strong one, putting me
nicknames and sand filling my closet
You will make me fight you?
You have no idea who I am, for
I do not give a fuck about you, your school
or your hockey game.
I'm leaving in three months and think
I'm going to waste my time with you
or with anyone else?
You is not worth it, brah.
No one here is worth. No one.
Nikki!
Gloria, want a ride?
I think so.
Hold on, partner.
Stop, okay.
Stop this partner thing.
I thought surfers were brave.
- What did you do?
Fight them all and be a hero?
Yes. Have done something would be better
than going out and doing nothing.
- What does that solve? Anything.
I know because I used to think so.
- And Nikki?
You let her go.
- I let it go?
She ran away from me.
Besides not you tell me
she was the sister of Jack.
- I did not know.
- It does not matter, man.
What is the problem?
I'm leaving in a few months.
You really disappoint me, man.
Nikki?
Need to talk to you.
Does not fill, okay?
Does not matter.
- You did not give me a chance to explain.
- I know, you go away in a few months
so not worth it.
- That's not what I meant.
Does not matter because you know what
you're right,  not even worth it. </ i>
Wiley!
Wake up man, wake up.
I have to tell you something.
Up, up.
I had a dream ... had a wave ...
not those of normal size
was a big, huge, like,
those who will not have another chance
As solar eclipse.
Tava enjoying it in the most styling.
Until I saw a shark,
even very large type.
And his name was  Pepe </ i>
- Pepe?
Pepe. And he began to come to me.
But then he stopped.
He looked at me and said in Spanish
 "La mia ès hello" </ i>
I spoke Spanish in my dream, man,
because at the time I understood what I was saying.
 "The wave is my" </ i>
Then I woke up.
- I woke up at 3 by a silly dream?
- Are you kidding? All we need
know're in our dreams, man.
They are windows for knowledge.
- So what this shark
 Pepe </ i> mean to you?
- It is obvious that Jack is the shark
and Nikki is the wave.
And he does not want me near her sister.
 La mia ès hello </ i>
The wave is mine.
So what does it do?
It comes on me like a shark.
I'm trying to scare me to stay
away from the wave, man!
- The question is?
- Is that when you have the perfect wave
or any perfect thing you go after.
You do not worry if you have a shark
almost biting her bottom,
there will always be sharks.
But when another wave appears
perfect like that?
- What does it mean?
Will fight with Jack?
- And throw Gandhi in his grave?
I think not.
Moreover, no need to fight
the shark to fight the wave ...
We Wiley.
- Go ahead. Do not worry.
I I'm cool.
All because of the  Pepe. </ I>
- What's he doing here?
- We can talk?
- No.
- And when we can?
After the game ... after the game.
- Jack, he's not thinking
in play, right?
- I do not know what he thinks, but
it is better to leave.
- Jack, is not the best worm playing?
- For what?
- If you let him play, we can see
he was kicked.
- Really, I like that, man.
- Hey people, you have room for more?
- Travis, you're out.
- <I> Adios </ i> California boy.
- You guys have a ... taco?
- Do not stop here, man.
- Get them surfer.
- That.
- Very good.
- Go after him, Mitchel!
- Get it, man.
- He will face.
- Soca it, we're here.
- A punch will.
Your franguinho.
- He will cry, Blane?
- Come on, hit me.
- Let Blane, I'm seeing him cry.
Yeah come a tear.
- What's wrong with you?
Why they have not done anything?
Why avoided face
these guys again?
Mitchel? Hello?
Get off!
- Are you all blurred!
- What was Blane?
- It is the Chocolate factory?
- Very funny.
- Get him.
Will soon.
- You were right, there are things
we must fight to achieve.
- Go.
- Not before I tell you my dream.
- It will not.
- The car, take the car!
- Get the car!
The cars!
You guys are in the right place?
- Yes, Mitchell's there?
Yes ... come ...
 Su ès cosa cosa mi. </ i>
Snake, Augie, Mark, Tony ...
Then Rosenblat?
You must be their friends of Wiley.
Father, their friends of Wiley.
- The ... hi ...
- He talks about you all the time.
- Boys, would you like something
to eat?
- No, thank you.
- So...
Father, let us make some popcorn.
- And ... I'm watching ...
- Come on, we can not take all day.
- They came to see you.
- Personal?
- I did not know who was so good, man.
- You are very good.
- I Never laughed so hard in my life.
- I think I understand you wrong.
Damn, man. Excuse me.
- All right, already was. Do not worry.
- Really? Nice.
- Get a grip, man, there's something. We were challenged
by Preps for a racing skates
to end this once and for all.
And we ... we want you to get on the team.
Help us.
What do you say?
- Where is the race?
- Devil's Backbone.
- We will have more chance if
is with us.
- What is the Devil's Backbone?
- Only the most dangerous slope
of the entire city.
The last guy who tried to go down
He broke so much that forgot who it was.
I saw it was the head pin and all ...
- Either way is a descent and such.
Very dangerous.
- Why do this?
- Because we're tired of being screwed up.
- Treated like trash.
- Losers.
- We are somebody and this is our chance to
prove. But we can only be a team.
What do you say, will you in or not?
- All this because of a shark
called Pepe, huh?
- What are you doing?
- Tô getting ready.
- Wiley, I ... do not ...
I know I know...
Jack, the rules are:
there are no rules, anything goes.
Why not start the race?
 Why do not we start the race? </ i>
The first team to cross the 3
finish line wins.
Blane stop, get out.
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.
Calm ...
Come Mitchell, secure!
I throw, come on.
Will face!
 Cabaços </ i>
Where did they go?
- This guy is very fast.
- But we have two to one now.
Another Prep and they win.
Let Jack, we have a race
to win.
Come on.
Know Popeye ... it is a great guy.
He...
