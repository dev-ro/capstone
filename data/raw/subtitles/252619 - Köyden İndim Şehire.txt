Not rich only, but millionaire!
What kind a prosperity is it? I don't

Take it, millionaire without underclothes.
So, what are gonna do with the golds now?
We can buy a lot of arable fields
and properties of the village.
A lot of oxen, cows, cattles and so on.
You ignoramus!
Why should we keep living in
the village with so much gold?
We would move to the big city.
Are we moving to city?
Are we going to be like city women?
Yeah.
But, if...
...we try to cash these in the city,
Government may want to requisition from us.
- Oh! - We'ld exchange them without
notification to the authorities. - To whom?
 - Brother Himmet! - What?  - He have a
countryman in Ankara as jeweller.
What is his name? Remember?
Ali Rıza, Ali Rıza!
He's our fellow, from our village.
- He wouldn't rat us, but exchange.
- Yeah.
How much would he pay?
How should I know, man.
- Let's count the quantity.
- OK.

- What the hell? - Can we also find a
beautiful girl for me to merry?
We will. Alright?
We have a huge welfare hereafter.
Ten thousand golden coins.
The sack is brilliant idea,
...nobody would think that
golds are inside the sack.
When are we going to head to the city?
Four of us will head to city
early in the morning.
Gee! Are not you taking us?
Are you going to revel with
coquettish women?
- You think that we would cheat you?
- Of course you would.
Relax, girls. First, let's go to Ankara
and find Ali Rıza, the jeweller.
Yeah, you will go and forget us, huh?
No way, we will come back soon...
If you ever fool, I'ld fink
on you to the cops...
...that you found a jug of golds
which's property of government.
Shut up, we will come back.
If we'll not, you can fink on
whomever you wish.
Gülsüm, come with me.
Go bring me a good costume
to wear tomorrow.
- Why don't you pick yourself?
- Why?
I even don't go to WC,
as tough I have a pee.
Shall I leave a sack of gold alone?
Go fetch it to me!
- Saffet.
- What?
You'll go far tomorrow,
Let's go home now.
- I can't?
- Why?
I can't leave the golds here.
- Would you bring my costume here?
- Alright.
I have to pee, bros.
- Go to piss.
- Go ahead to piss.
What if you snatch
some coins from sack?
- Don't you trust us?
- Yeah?
Brother should trust his
own brothers, shoudn't he?
Absolutely, he should.
Hey! What are doing?
Don't you trust me?
- Don't assume it as distrust,
but we also go. - Yeah.
Do you also have pee?
We just want to keep company with you.
Gayret, get in!
Keep door open!
So we come in, too.
We can't fit here.
Brother Himmet!
Hullo! It's OK. Now, relax.
When graceless people make some money,
... they all jockey each other for
 a few bucks more.  - Yeah.
We're still so close-knit to each other,
...in spite of we've a
sack of golden coins.
We even go to piss altogether.
Where are you going?
Were you not sleeping, bro?
I came to help you...
I don't want to make my dear brother
tired by carrying heavy sack.
We'ld take care my dear brother.
- But, we would do two shares.
- Exactly.
Did you check our bros sleeping?
Yeah. Muggins are asleep.
Have a nice morning.
Hush! Be quiet! Come down slowly.
You're outwitting me to leave here, right?
Hush! Don't yell!
Could we outwit you, bro?
- Sure.
- We poked you to wake up, you were asleep.
Who poked me, crafties?
I woke up myself!
You're already awaken! So what?
When we feel tired, you
would carry the sack.
Should I?
- Absolutely you would.
- Got it, There will be three shares!
Saffet is sleeping, isn't he?
Yes, sucker's still sleeping!
Sucker is you, muttonhead!
Fellow, give us four tickets to Ankara!
- The third class?
 - Gee.
Whom are you talking?
Give the most luxurious.
We're not the ordinary guys that you know.
Give first class tickets.
Himmet brother, you've spent all of our
money to buy most expensive tickets.
Who cares? We've a sack of golden coins.
Why couldn't we travel
with 3rd class tickets?
Do Turkey's richest men deserve...
...to travel with the
shabby people, dumbass?
To be rich is very comfortable, my dears.
If we'd been travelling at economy class...
Our asses would have been
chafed on the benches.
- So, have good journey for all.
Thanks.
- Have good journey.
Shoo! Why are sitting down like that?
Our brother is right. People doesn't
sit cross-legged in the...
...luxurious class. They
cross leg on other.
Give a try!
No. Like this, you hick!
Like this?
Oh God!
I thought I arrived in Ankara.
We also thought that we arrived to Ankara.
What's gonna happen now?
We get on the next train to Ankara.
We don't have any money.
We would walk.
Can we find the way to Ankara?
Where does this railway go?
To Ankara.
Hey, fellow, what is going on here?
Why is this crowd?
It's republican day's parade.
Brother Himmet...
Shall we ask to cops over there
that where we could find Ali Rıza?
Are you fool, man, why should
we ever ask the police?
They would make requisition
the golds and arrest us.
- Let's ask somebody else.
- Yes.
Excuse me fellow...
How can we find Ali Rıza?
Who is Ali Rıza?
Good heavens! He doesn't know Ali Rıza?
- Probably he's not from here,
maybe stranger.  - Yeah.
- Hey fellow, are you local?
- Yes.
Good.
- We're looking for uncle Ali Rıza.
- I don't know him.
What an ignorant man! He
doesn't know uncle Ali Rıza.
I think, we couldn't find Ali Rıza.
Why not? If you aspire,...
...you can find the needle
in the haystack.
Let me ask. Excuse me,
fellow where is haystack?
Let's walk!
- It's not this jewellery shop.
Not this one. - Not, not.
Here it is, Ali Rıza jewellery.
- Closed!
- Closed.
- Uncle Ali Rıza! - Uncle Ali Rıza!
Hey guys, do not knock at.
There is nobody inside!
- Why?
- Today is the holiday,...
...so, all shops are closed.
- Closed? When will it be open?
- Tommorrow.
We have a sack of golds,
but still stone-broke?
What the hell are we gonna
do now, brother Himmet?
Let's go to a restaurant
first, feed ourselves.
- How to pay? We're stone-broke!
- Not any?
We have nothing!
So let's go to the restaurant
and pay nothing.
My God!!
Why did you get angry
to me brother Himmet, I'm just...
You are the shame of family, fool.
It's you who proposed to make 
a good marble grave...
...for our dead father with all savings?
Did I propose it?... Oh, yes.
People is watching parade. We are
wandering as stone-broke in misery.
It's only for tommorrow, bros.
Then, we'll be riches hereafter.
Brother Himmet, let me carry the sack.
You must have been tired.
No. I'm the eldest. I'll take care it.
Oh, there he is.
My dear, as I see your face...
I immediately recognized you.
Have you recognized us?
We are the Behçet's sons
from village in Kayseri.
I am not mr. Ali Rıza, but a salesman here.
- Where is he?
- Call him right here.
He's not here, went to Istanbul.
Did he go to Istanbul? When will
he be back?
Tomorrow.
Drink as much as you can,
to feed yourself, man.
It lumps like a rock into my stomach.
We've turned to walking water ballons.
All have fatigued by severe hunger.
- Let's exchange one coin only.
- Yeah.   - To whom, dumbass?
Is Ali Rıza the only one jewelller here?
We exchange the coins
to unfamiliar jeweller...
...so that he'ld rat us to
cops to snatch the golds?
- Would they do?
- Absolutely.
No other way to await Ali Rıza to cash!
Be careful. You'll be run over by vehicles.
- My God. Cop!
- Gee!
Cross the road.
- He's calling us.
- We're done!
- Keep cool! Don't let him doubt us.
- Smile!
You can walk across the street, guys.
- Let's wave hands.
- Wave hands.
You can come across the street!
Argh!
Brother Himmet has fallen to ground!
Are you tired, Himmet brother?
If you want, I'll carry it.
No, I am the eldest brother.
Therefore, golds should be with me.
Give us a bagel for one lira!
Here it is!
Are you ripping off us, kid?
No. 1 lira for each, dude!
My gosh!
Take it Hayret, for you and you.
Feed yourselves good.
I'm still starving.
Brother Himmet, I have an idea.
- What is it?
- Shall we do some begging?
Yes, we shall.
Maybe, we could buy a few more bagels.
Never!! Should the richest men
of Turkey do begging?
No way to begging!
I can't stand!
I can't stand anymore!
Gayret, what can't you stand?
To starving, I'm hungry.
Bear it!
Tomorrow Ali Rıza's coming.
I don't care. I will not
be able to meet him.
I will die because of hunger tonight.
He called and told that to stay
one day more, coming tomorrow.
Tomorrow is too late.
I can't survive until tomorrow.
Grin and bear it.
See how I and Himmet brother've
been enduring.
- Bullshit.
- We don't?
I've been starving to death.
Find a solution brother Himmet.
Let's look for a job and...
...make some money to survive.
Oh! Brother Himmet, I have no strenght
to work because of fatigue.
Keep working, man. Why did we get a job?
Because, I'll take you to
best restaurants to feed.
We were digging, while we found
golds, we are still keep digging.
Were we born to dig, men?
We are working by digging
but for one day only.
Tommorrow Ali Rıza is coming.
Bullshit.
This jerk will never come.
Oh, I'm gonna die of hunger.
Brother Hayret...
...what if we find another jug of golds?
Never mention it! We're still broke...
...with a sack of a golden coins.
If we'ld find more, we would
be screwn up in misery.
Chef, what do you have to eat?
Kebaps, chicken skewers,..
...rice, beans, soups.
642, 643, 644, 645, 646..
- Himmet brother.
- 647... What!
All meal were good, but kebab with
bashed patatoes was excellent.
It's kebab with mashed
patatoes, not bashed, man.
Screw your kebab. Don't talk,
when I count!

Why are you yelling at in the shop, dudes?
Don't get butt-in, bloke!
We're looking for jackass named Ali Rıza.
Keep it clean!
I'm Ali Rıza!
Here is mr. Ali Rıza.
Ali Rıza has already come!
Oh, our beloved! Oh, our dear fellow uncle!
It's obvious that our dear
fellow from Kayseri.
Allow us shake your hand.
Don't mention it! Don't mention it!
Stop there.
Who are you, what do you want?
We came to, err..
We're going to exchange a golden coin.
Give it to me, let me check.
Here.
Oh! Ancient Byzantine gold!
Where did you get it?
We found it somewhere.
How much does it cost?
It would cost a grand.
What! A... a... thousand? Give!
Take!
Hey!
- No!
- It's mine!
I'm the eldest brother, I will keep it.
Brother Himmet. Let's buy some
good costumes...
...to dress up good and
get rid of sleazy costumes.
Of course, we're gonna
spruce up ourselves.
- A thousand is enough?
- Sure. Even more than how much we need.
It'ld worth at least two thousand.
We made a thousand in the
early hours of morning.
Boss, I think these guys
have more golden coins.
Cut it off! How could these bumpkins have?
Obviously they have got from somewhere.
Uncle Ali Rıza, here we are again.
What do you want?
We want to exchange four golden coins more.
Oh, welcome to my dear nephews.
I'm coming.
I've been thinking about you ever since.
My dear nephews visited me from upcountry.
I've been blaming myself because of why
I didn't show my hospitality to my dears.
I'm so sorry fo my inconsiderateness.
Welcome, here you are.
Comfort yourselves, fellows.
Fetch some tea for us. Quickly.
My precious guests.
Shall you exchange?
It's easy, I would do.
This's like merry-go-round.
What's up my nephews?
Don't hesitate. Come in.
We can't get in, the door
has kept revolving...
...and threw us out.
Come one by one.
Come in, get in.
- You are welcome.
- Hello, there.
- You're welcome mr. Ali Rıza.
- How are you?
Thank you, sir. How can I help you?
We need four luxury rooms for my nephews.
- Sure, sir.
- We don't need four individual rooms?
A bigger room is enough for us.
We don't have a room with four bed, sir.
No problem. We can fit in one room.
We have no application like this.
But it's OK for sake of mr. Ali Rıza.
Take the gentlemen to room.
- Let me take it, sir.   - Hey?
- Don't ever touch it.
What are you staring at them astonished?
Apparently they have something
very precious in the sack.
- Here is your room, take your key.
- Thanks.
This is the lavatory. So, do you like?
Room is good, but...
...why is the WC inside the room?
- Yes, no countryman pisses
inside the room. - Yeah.
WC is always next to room in luxury hotels.
Your room has a balcony over here.
- See, you have a good panaromic view.
- Yeah, yeah...
It's very high, I have vertigo.
I have a pee.
Let's go and piss.
Are you going to WC altogether?
We never leave each other.
Brothers!
I think Ali Rıza realised
that golds are in a sack.
- Did he?
- Yeah.
Then, let's run away.
We need him to cash the golds.
Just be carefully. Got it?
Let's spruce up, uncle Ali Rıza.
Don't worry.
I will take you to the
most luxurious store,
you will be dress up whatever you want.
Shall we call a cab?
No, my dear.
I've parked my car there, in
front of the bakery shop.
Here it's my car.
Oh... is this your car?
Well, it's mine, get on.
Let's go. Go, go.
We've been bothering you too much.
Never mention it, nephews.
It's a beautiful car, my dear.
Seats are also very soft and comfortable.
That's it, are we okay?
OK.
There it is!
Thanks for God's blessing.
Still here!
Yeah! Thank you God.
Hey, guys, where are you
taking away the sack of flour?
Come here!
- Bring my sack!
- He wants to have the golds.
Let's run away.
Leave the sack! Hey! Help!
Let's get on the bus!
Guys, to travel with sack is forbidden!
Why forbidden?
It's for human transportation only.
- Who forbids it?
- It's public transportation...
...regulations, only passangers allowed.
 Bullshit...
Sack is not allowed, huh?
If you had known what's inside the sack...
Anyway, it's your fault.
Why did you let clumsy to carry the sack?
Why didn't do it by yourself, idiot?
It's not my fault.
It's not me to blame...
...but this jackass!
Hey! Why am I to be blamed?
It's not me who forgotten the huge sack...
...in front of the bakery shop,
but this dumbass next to me!
Why are staring at me? Didn't you
meet any dumbass before?
Come on.
Hey! Sack stuck the door!
- Open the door, driver!
- Knock at the door!
Open the door!
Bus is moving!
Hayret, don't leave it!
- Oh!
- Our beloved sack!
Welcome gentlemen.
Mr. Ali Rıza has telephoned for you, sir.
Thank you.
We lost way to be back
to home, so, we're late.
When the sack was stuck in the bus...
...some might have fallen out of sack.
Let's count to be sure.
Unload'em onto the bed!
Good heavens!
Good heavens!
As a flour-white?... My God?!
What happened, sister-in law?
They run out of the hotel.
Their faces were as pale as flour.
They must have been ghastly upset,...
...since they have lost the
golden coins, dimwits.
Wife, I feel bad myself.
Whole golds are gone!
Have a good day, man!
We came for ..., err...
Sent by labor agency for
vacant positions?
No. We came by ourselves.
Good, we need employees.
- What job?
- Shut up!
What do you do with flours that you have?
Here's bakery shop. We produce breads.
Hush!
What?
Shovel... You're cooking it!
Let it be cooked, what should I do?
Hayret!
Send the dough!
It looks like this dough is a little runny?
Add some flour into it.
Hey, Hayret!
What?
Send us some dough.
Here it is, catch it brother.
Hey! Check out the breads!
- What are we gonna do?
- We'ld be fired up to finding the golds.
Make them disappear.
Quickly!
These breads are a little bigger,
aren't they?
Are they?
I would decrease.
How about this?
Gayret, send the dough.
No problem.
Gayret, send the dough.
The dough is over.
Let 's go upstairs to help...
...to prepare some doughs. Let's go.
You stupid, what kind of
breads are you making?
Not good enough?
Step aside!...
Load some flour with Gayret.
- Bring here more flour, Saffet.
- Alright.
Brother Himmet, brother Gayret.
- What?
- What's up, man?
Golds!!...
It's not time to think about golds...
...while the boss is around. Keep working.
No...
Our dumbass brother poured
the golds into the raw dough.
- What? Where did he pour the golds?
- Golds!!!
Clumsy man of family, stop it!
Pick them all..
Our golds!
What a beautiful golds!
I think he didn't recognize us...
Do you recognize us now?
Yes, he did already.
Thank you.
Here we go!
Yes mr. Ali Rıza... They've just arrived.
They were a little bit doughy.
No, not soggy, sir. Just doughy...
Soggy but doughy. Doughy but soggy.
A sack?
Yes, they have a sack with them.
These guys are my relatives from village.
Did you pick something nephews?
Yes. We picked some cloths.
Wear them so that we could check.
Dressing room is there.
Here you are!
- Would you help them to dress up please.
- Gentlemen, welcome. - Thank you.
- It's for one man, sir.
- They've been always together.
Please, I'll take care them by myself.
I'm here to help them. Thanks.
- Listen to me.
- Yeah?
His eyes are on the sack. We have to
keep our eyes skinned and be vigilant..
Don't worry, brother, we'll see.
Your sack was stuck here. So I just...
Oh, I see. Let me take in.
Oh! You all look like movie stars.
You're so cool handsome guys.
Let me see closer, my God!
You have an excellent appearance.
I want to invite you all to
home for dinner tonight.
Well, we'll attend.
We'll become acquainted with family.
Hello!
- Ali Rıza has come to take us home.
- Let him wait us at reception.
Don't send him up, ...
...we're coming right now.
Hurry up, Ali Rıza might come to room.
Pockets are not deep enough.
Tailor charged us 100 liras to sew this.
Nothing else to do, man?
Ali Rıza clearly understood that
what we have in the sack.
Got it, but, since we
hide the golds on you...
...why we are carrying the sack?
So that he could see what's in the sack...
...and don't let him lurk
around us, dumbass.
Yeah.
Let's go this way.
Our key.
Mr. Ali Rıza's awaiting you by his car.
- Alright!
- Brother Himmet!
- I can barely stand still.
Don't ever touch me!
Honey, see! My nephews came...
...to visit me from Kayseri.
This's the youngest, Gayret.
My wife.
- My sister in law.
- Welcome.
This is Saffet.
- Saffet, with the sack.
- Welcome boys.
- My sister in law.
- You're welcome.
And this is Hayret.
My wife. My sister in law.
You're welcome.
- This is the eldest, Himmet.
Arrggh.
- What's happened?
- A burden suddenly collapsed onto me.
Stand up, brother Himmet!
Don't touch him uncle Ali Rıza.
Let him sit down to comfort
himself, Ali Rıza.
Are you alright guys. Need medical care?
Don't mention it, uncle Ali Rıza.
It happens occasionally.
Really?
Himmet, are you sure that you're OK?
Yeah...
Burden has been still with me.
Help me to rise!
- Sit down here.
- Slowly, guys.
- Is it durable enough?
- Yes, it is.
Slowly!
It's OK.
The chair is well-built and strong enough.
Here you are, please. Don't hesitate.
Saffet, comfort yourselves, please.
Sit down here, please.
Right here.
Gayret, you also have a seat.
I'll sit down here.
Youngest is charmingly cute.
- Yes.
- Yeah. That's the goods!
Saffet, don't bother yourself.
Release the sack to comfort yourself.
Don't worry. That's OK.
They never leave the sack, wife.
There's a reason, uncle
Ali Rıza. A good reason.
I had told you wife.
See? They're dining with
the sack on the lap.
So what? Let them do how
they comfort themselves.
Leave them alone.
Ali Rıza!...
You didn't mention me about nephews before.
Are you married, do you have
children in the village?
Three of us are married, he's single.
Yes, I'm single. Brother Himmet
will find a city girl to marry me.
Hush!
Lady, as you all know,
loneliness in the city...
...is terrible bad. We all do necessary
stuffs, like laundry works by ourselves.
It 's very difficult for us
which is we're not familiar.
Therefore, to live in the
city seemed us easy.
But it's quite difficult
for us to live alone.
Hey, be serious, man.
So, we have decided to...
...go to village early in the morning...
..We will bring our wives to city, too.
Let them come here also.
It's a pleasure for me to host....
...you all my dear nephews.
Uncle Ali Rıza, thank you for all...
To show our appreciation for your kindness,
We have brought a present
from village for you.
Oh. It's your kindness.
You deserve better ones.
- Saffet.
- What?
Hand over our present to uncle Ali Rıza.
Is this what you brought
to me as a present?
Yeah!
Come on, open it so that
he could see our present to him.
Ouch! What is this?
Bacon!
Were there no golds in this sack?
- It's Kayseri's gold, more worthful...
- What?
He fainted.
- Rub my wrists.
- I'm just rubbing.
I'll kick them out, these
stone-broke bumpkins!
My foolishness. How could
I have thought that...?
They might have hidden
the stuffs in the village.
Shut up. Otherwise I would
kick you out, too.
Chubby bumpkin broke my chair. 
Throw out the broken chair to garbage.
Alright. I would throw it away.
Throw out me to garbage, too.
I'm an absolute sucker.
Why do you blame me, boss?
Why not? It's you...
...who told me that these bumpkins
have a plenty of golden coins.
- Yes, I did but...
-  Shut up! Cut the crab.
You drove me...
...to spend a lot of money
to host the bumpkins.
Yes, but they're your fellow relatives.
Despicable these kind of fellows.
Damn these kind of...
-...folks. - Uncle Ali Rıza, excuse me
could you cash four coins more for us?
... I was saying just 
love these kind of folks.
Sure, I would cash, of course...
What are you gonna do with the money?
We may need on the way to village.
God! How should I let you..
...go alone to village...
while my car is at idle at the parking lot?
No way! I never let you go,
I will take you there...
...by myself, your dear uncle.
Step aside, kids!
Be meak, kids.
Move away, move away.
Good Heavens! Look at Behçet's sons!
These rural kids are very rude, my dear.
Yes, just like they haven't
seen urban guys before.
Oh! Hello guys.
How are you doing folks?
Where have you been for a couple of days?
We have been in Ankara.
- You found a treasure, right?
- No dear.
We just went to visit uncle Ali Rıza.
Oh! Is he mr. Ali Rıza? Welcome.
Can we offer you glass of tea?
My gosh, Himmet has come back!
My husband came back. My dear husband.
Here my wife is coming.
Himmet!...
Oh! What the hell is it?
You all dressed like you are
urban gentlemen, huh?
- Welcome all.
- Thanks.
Oh! Who is that girl?
She's my sister-in-law.
Is she? Come on.
Let's go to home. Welcome to us.
Thanks, you go first.
I'll chat with my fellows
and drink some tea first.
You go with them.
Let's go sister-in-law, come on.
- Saffet has come back.
- Really?
Welcome, have a seat, please.
Excuse us for our humble village home.
Thank you.
Why are you standing? Sit down.
No, it's alright.
Don't think that it's for dandyness.
Our trousers may wrinkle.
Let mine wrinkle. I'll make re-ironed.
Hayret!
My gosh!
See? We have a guest.
That's his wife.
You are welcome.
Thank you.
- Saffet!
- Emine!
- Saffet!
- Don't do it, honey.
Why not?
Look at who's sitting there.
Did you bring a paramour to home?
Are you nuts? How could I cheat on you?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Mr. Ali Rıza, where did you
know Behçet's sons?
How the hell could I know
them? They came to me.
What do they want from you?
They brought me some golden coins to cash.
Behold? I told you that...
...they've found burial golds.
What golds?
They've been obsessed with burial stuffs.
They had even go to Istanbul and
search for buried treasures and golds.
Aperantly they must
have a lot of golden stuffs.
Watch out, don't step onto turd!
Our costume are going to grimed here.
- Exactly. Turds stinks everywhere.
- Yeah, exactly.
They are coming.
Where are my going nephews?
We are gonna visit our father's grave.
Good idea. I'll come with you...
...to pray for his soul at his grave.
There are so kind people in this world...
... to build marble the tombstone.
You dumbass...
Excuse me father for my languange.
We paid the expenses, you fool.
- Did we make it done?
- You sucker.
Yes!
Argh!
Gayret, Saffet, come over here.
Ouch!
Come to help me!
Go!
I was almost to be buried alive.
A heavy burden collapsed onto me.
And then grave collapsed.
Leave him alone uncle Ali Rıza!
What kind of henna is this?
This is not henna.
- What is this?
- Nail lacquer.
- Nail lacquer?
- Gee! She did also on toes!
Gorgeous!
Excuse me. May I ask you that...
.. if all women in city
dress low-cut like you?
- Sure. - I thought, fabric in the
tailor was short for your dress.
Nephews, where are your wives?
They are about come.
Good, good...
You are right, sister-in-law.
They have plenty of golds.
- How did you realise?
- I heard that they have found...
... a big quatity of buried
golden stuffs in Istanbul.
- Fellow, you can plow our arable
fields for your own. - Alright.
Have our cattles, too.
- You make payment, whenever available.
- OK.
Where could they have hidden the stuffs?
In the chest. Where else could be?
Which chest?
Look at there.
Oh! What a huge chest!
Here we came our sweet home.
Go ahead.
Slowly, be careful.
Come on, go, go!
We could have gone hotel
to stay. We don't want to...
 ...bother you, uncle Ali Rıza.
If you had been alone,...
...I would have booked hotel room.
But when you're with your families,
I never let you stay in hotel.
My home is at your service.
Go ahead girls.
Bring your chest.
Ali Rıza. How should we host them all?
No individual bedrooms for all.
Hush. They may hear us speaking.
Be patient and moderate for a few days.
Until I snatch the chest of golds.
Where are they going to sleep?
- We reserve our bedroom for men's use.
- Gosh!
Women are to live in
sister-in-law's room.
What about us?
- Who cares it, idiot? Be smart
a little more. - My gosh!
Oh! You have a beautiful home.
Not big enough but it's OK.
Sorry that you're so far behind us.
No, you're so far in front of us.
Don't be bothered for us. It's alright.
Come here honey.
We have precious guests.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
We didn't mean to bother you, lady...
Uncle Ali Rıza insisted
very much to host us.
Nothing to bother me. You're
always welcome.
- Appreciate to you.
- Honey, these are my brides.
...Wives of my nephews.
Oh! Very beautiful brides
for family. Welcome.
You are all welcome, girls.
Thanks for kindness.
My nephews, we have roasted lamp,...
...after soup. Feed yourselves good.
Excuse us, for bothering
you, uncle Ali Rıza.
If you ever mention again,
you would hurt me!
Never a  botherness for me!
Oh! Here's our salad.
Be carefully. You were
about to break the plate.
Why are you yelling at me?
Nothing broken.
I paid 20 thousands for it. Shall
I throw it to garbage the whole?
My God! Does a plate cost 20 thousands?
No dear, Not just a plate, a whole set.
..Original Czechoslovakian porcelain...
...144 pieces...
But one of them broken, the
whole set would be screwn-up.
The soup is very delicious,
you made it excellently.
Be carefully, sucker.
You were about spoil the
set of 20 thousands.
Why did put it plate so
roughly like this, idiot?
He broke.
Plate has been broken!
You wasted the whole
precious set to garbage.
You, dumbass,...
You broke it by yourself
you to show the wife.
He broke, too.
I did, too.
Whole set totally screwn-up.
Uncle Ali Rıza, excuse us. We...
...unintentionally broke a few plates.
Doesn't matter, guys. Let them broken.
As you keep breaking the
plates.
Let me check that if...
...lamp of chest, err..., damn it,
....roasted chest is ready in the kitchen.
830, 831, 832...
Hush!
834, 835, 836, 837,838.
Hush!
Dumbass Ali Rıza,...
...dumbass Ali Rıza. You stupid.
Hey, wife.
There must be exactly mistake
in my family tree.
Hullo! How did you come up with it?
'Cause, my Kayserian root
can't have so stupid people.
It's right... Absolutely.
I gave my own bedroom
these flat-broke bumpkins.
I rough it myself on the chair.
Look at me,
...sister-in law. It's all your fault.
Oh! Why am I to be blamed, my dear?
You told me that they keep
golden stuffs in the chest.
Why are you yelling at her?
You aspired to host them in the home.
Shut up! You stupid.
Hush. They may hear us.
Let them hear.
- I'll kick these bumkins out of my home.
- Talk to my hat!
I'll kick out. I'll kick out.
9930, 9931, 9932.
9933. See?
When everybody keep silence,
I count accurately with no confusion.
1, 2...
You've bothered yourself
to comfort us uncle.
You had us sleep on the good mattress.
But yourself, curl to sleep on the chair.
I mean it's a shame for us.
Yes, it's shameful!...
I was going to talk to you.
My home isn't big enough for everybody.
You are my fellows,...
...but I'm done. That's it!
You have to sort yourselves out.
You're exactly right, uncle Ali Rıza.
We already have figured out the same.
We can bother you no more.
Cash us four golden coins more...
...for accomodation expenses.
To find accomodation?
How can I let my dears to leave?
It's huge home, enough for us.
We don't want to discomfort you.
No way! What discomfort?
You're my beloved relatives.
Check it out.
- What's this?
- Golden coin.
We have a plenty of it.
Where?
Brother Himmet keep all with himself.
- Really?
- Keep dancing.
My God, how I have couldn't
figured out. Of course...
Goldens have been always with them.
They keep the stuffs with themselves.
As he sat down on the chair,
broke down the chair. Why?
Because of weights of stuffs.
So it is. He collapsed into recent
grave in the village. Why?
Because of weights of stuffs.
Well done, sister-in-law!
I'll buy whatever you wish as gift.
I wish nothing.
Here's the gold that he
gave me, on my necklage.
You shouldn't have worn it.
What if one realises? Hush!
Oh! My dears you woke up early.
Did you sleep good? My dears.
Come to dinner table,...
...my nephews and pretty girls.
I'm alright but...
...youngest of us still sleeping.
Night life of city gave us aching
in my legs, uncle Ali Rıza.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
Gee!
Himmet, why are you standing up,...
...sit down to have a breakfast.
No, it's OK.
I need to be back to our room.
Wake up, jerk!
What's going on?
Wake up, jerk!
You gave the golden to her, didn't you?
What golden?
He's stolen the golden.
No. I didn't steal it. It
shown up from the bread.
Why didn't you tell us?
To give her as a present.
Why did you give her present?
To keep the secret.
Which secret, you mean?
That you keep the stuffs on you.
How could she know?
I told her.
Did you tell?
Yeah.
What's gonna happen
when Ali Rıza will know it?
- We would hide.
- To where?
In the sack!
They had been already in the sack, dumbass.
We would bury the sack.
We would bury.
Where?.
Brother Himmet! Let's bury all
somewhere in the city center.
We'ld be caught while we're digging.
What if we forget
where we buried the golds?
We'ld bury in somewhere we know.
We make a sign to where we bury.
Ali Rıza may stalk us.
Let's keep an eye on our back.
Halt!
- I told you that Ali Reza'ld stalk us,
didn't I?    - You did!
- He's following us, right behind.
- Where?
Gosh!
He's in disguise of a woman?
- Is he?
- You dimwit.
Go!
Brother Himmet, what about if we
bury somewhere around here?
Fool. Here's crowded with
apartments and people.
Let's find somewhere deserted.
Brother Himmet!...
I will say you something,
if you don't get angry to me.
- Say it.
- Ali Rıza is after us.
Nobody!
Nobody?
Are you kidding us, dumbass?
Brother Himmet, don't care it.
Let's find somewhere to hide to stuffs.
Brother Himmet, My feet are
tired to wandering around.
Is it easy to bury a sack of golds, bros?
What's up with you, man?
- I have a pee.
- Piss it.
- Where?
- Come with me.
Oh! I've relaxed now! Cool.
Damn you, suckers!
- Lather it more.
- Cool it!
No one pissed on me before.
What were you doing behind the bushes?
How did you have them piss on your face?
Hidden there so that none of
them could see me after them.
Dumbasses came to piss on
the bushes in front of me.
You burnt me. Too hot! Too hot!
46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
There we go. Dig here, Hayret!
What if we forget the location?
Which fool could forget the location?
You stand in front of tree shaped
like ball which is right...
...between two poplar trees
in front of white building.
You walk straight ahead for 50 steps.
That's where we hide the stuffs!
It's so easy.
Shake me firmly, shake good, bros.
Hold tight brother Himmet.
Peek around so that nobody spy upon us!
- Give the sack to me.
- Here it is.
OK. Collect all into the sack.
Brother Himmet, you took only
5 golden coins, is it enough?
Whenever we need, we come and
take more. This is our bank.
What a bank!
Fill it up, bros.
Hurry up, go, go...
Compact it!
Let 's check it.
Alright. Perfect!
No one can expose what's underground.
Perfectly hidden. It's hard
to figure out even for us.
We have a landmark here, dear.
My bros flipped their lid to
me because of I told you.
How did they get it?
They saw golden coin in your necklage.
They told me that you
would rat us to Ali Rıza.
Then, what did you do?
We buried all to hide.
Where?
If I tell you...
Shall you go away with me far from here?
Will your brothers let you go?
We'll go away without telling anyone.
All of golden coins is ours.
But never mention it to Ali Rıza.
If all will be ours, why should I mention?
Am I stupid?
Come on, tell me where did you bury?
- There's a white building between
two poplar trees. - So what?
When you turn your back to ball
shaped tree in front of them.
- Listen to me carefully!
- What?
We'll wake up very early in the morning
to take all stuffs and go. - Gee!
What about your brothers?
Tell nothing to them!
You mention nothing to anybody.
We'll take all and go away.
My God. Are you serious, Hayret?
Will all of the goldens be ours?
Of course! Hush!
We'll go to get all early in the morning.
Be vigilant. Never talk to others.
There's white tree between...
...two ball shaped trees...
Walk there. Turn you back and...
...walk 50 steps more!
What if you can't find the exact location?
Why shouldn't I find it, am I an idiot?
I have memorized the location good.
Repeat it again.
When you ask suddenly,...
I get excited and can't say.
I can find it.
Don't worry. Never mention
it others. Alright?  - Alright.
When we take the golds. Let's go
away as far as possible.
Why so far away?
If my brothers catch me..
I would hide you.
You don't know them, they can feel
the smell of goldens from far.
Therefore, we'ld go to move to Istanbul.
Can't I find you in Istanbul,
you, dumbass?
My brother!
You intend to snatch the golds, don't you?
No, I just...
Where are you going with shovel, brother?
Me?
You are already my youngest brother.
You know that I love you best.
We share them all.
- Yeah, we do.
- Right?
- Yes.
- Saffet.
- Emine.
What are you gonna do
when we get the golds?
We will go to Istanbul...
...and we live revel life together.
- My gosh!
- My gosh!
- Gayret?
- Brother Himmet!
- Saffet!
- Brother Saffet!
What a coincidence!
What's gonna happen now?
- We do three shares.
- Oh! - Good...
Pray for God, since you have
such a smart husband.
We will take all...
...while dumbasses are sleeping.
The early bird catches the worm.
Bullshit!
I got up earliest, so what?
Brother Himmet, is that you?
Yeah.
Are Saffet and Gayret with you?
Here we are.
Understood, we will do four shares.
Come on, let's go ahead, bros.
Here's the ball shaped tree.
Eveything is there!
Here is the white building.
Here are the poplar trees.
When we turn back to this direction...
What the hell!
A fair was built on the golds!
Did you bury golds in the
amusement park? Gee!
There was no amusement park here.
What's gonna happen now?
Well, we'll go and dig to get all.
Let's go.
Go ahead!
28, 29, 30,  31.
35, 36, 37, 38.
39, 40.
