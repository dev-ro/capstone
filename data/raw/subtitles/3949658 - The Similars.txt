THE SIMILARS
BUS STATION
OCTOBER 2, 1968 - 00:37 TO 5
HOURS OF THE CITY OF MEXICO
It seems like the whole world
is going to fall apart tonight.
But Mart√≠n has no
reason to worry.
Everything he values
is inside this office,
safe from rain and other
unexplained phenomena
and dangerous conditions
that affect our world.
Or, at least...
it's what Martin thinks.
And when all that a man holds dear
is within four walls...
there is no reason to worry.
Martin, victim of
forgetfulness and time.
Martin, stuck in a routine
that he hates and loves,
and that he will leave soon.
Or... at least,
it's what Martin thinks.
But he is not the important
character of this story.
In fact,
Martin is no more than a
pawn in someone else's game.
And the storm that falls
a few feet above him,
is no more important to Martin
than rain falling
in other countries.
Or, at least...
it's what Martin thinks.
We came back and we are worried
about the interference...
with the listeners.
This rain is not normal.
We already know that...
Still do not know anything?
No, not yet, sir.
I've already said.
The storm has delayed all lines
and this is the last station.
At least call them!
Are you listening to XIE -
Coyote Radio,
transmitting at 100,000
watts, from Mount Teotepec.
Modern music and the
news you need to know,
24 hours a day.
Offered by our sponsors...
Mom, I need to do a
model for school,
But the house is broken.
If you are looking for miniatures,
we have the right solution for you.
Trees, houses, cars...
and miniature furniture
of the highest quality.
Wow, they look so real!
Thank you, Edy Lan!
Miniatures Edy Lan, the
most realistic possible!
-  English Hospital, good evening.
- Yes, hello.
- Good evening!
-  Right? Is anyone there?
You can put me through to Signor
Alberto Engers,
in Room 191, please?
Who the fuck, please?
Ulises Martinez!
"Is it urgent!" I'm out
of town on a pay phone!
One moment please.
AGITATOR STUDENTS
WILL MEET IN TLATELOLCO
ON OCTOBER 2
Ulysses, where are you?
Thank God, Signor Alberto!
I've been trying to get
out of here all night!
Are you still in Guerrero?
The buses are delayed because of the
rain, and he had to warn them.
How is Maria?
Bad.
I don't think you'll be able to get...
May I help?
May I help?
May I help?
Can I use your phone?
Sorry sir.
We only have the one line for
calls between stations.
The bus is 4 hours late!
4 hours, shit!
It's raining hard everywhere!
Didn't you hear the news?
It's raining in the city too.
When does the next bus
leave for the capital?
I was talking about this
with this gentleman.
They are all delayed
by the storm.
No, do not tell me that!
I need to get to the capital.
It's an emergency!
The 8:15 should have arrived at
9pm, but it has not arrived yet.
"Can you call me a cab?"
- We do not have a line.
Pardon.
You can try the pay phone.
Calls fail, but
you may be lucky.
Thanks.
Can you send a taxi to
the bus station, please?
For Irene.
- Thanks.
-  Are you tired of driving?
Cars also serve for fun.
We invite you to discover the new
Cinema Drive-In, "El Zopilote,"
located on the corner
of the Plaza El Milagro
and the Los Patriotas Avenue.
Bring the family to enjoy
a special package.
Wow... thank you.
You're very kind...
I need to get to Mexico City.
Is the cab coming?
That's what they said...
Are you feeling all right?
The taxi will cost you dearly.
If you want, we can split.
I'm also in a hurry to get here.
Something to drink.
Yes of course.
ALMOST EVERYBODY LIKES
THE BEST, COCA-COLA
Thanks.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
What is your name?
Ulysses. And you are...?
Irene.
I left him lying by the bed, I do
not know if I hit him too hard.
I have to get to the capital,
or neither of us will survive.
Wait, calm down.
The two who?
Hit who?
How many months?
Eight.
We are the same.
My wife is giving birth
and I'm not there.
I spoke to my father-in-law
now, but the call dropped.
I need to get out of here. My
wife is not well, neither am I.
I even fainted and
I do not know why.
Have you told the police?
- No.
I do not want...
I want to see my family.
If he finds me, he'll kill me...
- You think he's coming here?
- Yes.
Does he have a car?
A green Valiant.
Can I have a cigarette?
Yes of course.
You shouldn't smoke.
I don't smoke.
The taxi will cost a fortune.
Signora, do you want to
share a taxi with us?
Let's go to the capital.
Signora, do you speak Spanish?
Signora? Please.
Signora! Take it easy.
Signora!
We want to know...
Signora...
- What did she say?
- I don't know.
THE NAME'S BOND...
JAMES BOND
ATHLETE CLUB OF BILBAO
The storm is not
limited to Mexico.
There is news from Canada,
Bolivia, even Norway,
of places devastated
in the past few hour by storms.
At the same time, in Mexico...
This morning, already day...
Something unprecedented.
Meteorologists cannot...
of this phenomenon.
Maybe it's a hurricane
on a world scale.
It's impossible...
Good evening.
You gave me a scare!
Excuse me...
Want a hand towel?
Thanks.
Are you feeling all right?
You look distressed.
Yes I'm fine.
Thanks.
I'm taking a cab
along with a lady.
Ulysses...
they've been born...
- more...
- Were they born?
-  Yes, Ulysses...
- How were you born?
He is the father of twins.
They are the same, and
equal to you, man!
Yes?
This rain is driving
all of us crazy.
As if we needed more
craziness in this country.
May I?
Of course.
Martin and I stayed all day
listening to the radio
about the Polytechnic
and the demonstration
in Tlatelolco.
I don't think it's the best time
to bring a baby into the world.
Signor Alberto, can you hear me?
What?
No...
Who is Martin?
The one at the ticket office.
He's no good at all.
Martin?
Give him a chance.
Since his wife
died 20 years ago,
he's been here waiting for
his retirement.
Hello?
Hello?
Shut the fuck up!
Don't you want to go outside?
Not to be closeted away here.
No way.
What am I going to do out there?
My place is here.
Don't worry about Martin.
But that other man who
screams all night...
That one gives me shivers.
Something strange.
He seemed very kind to me.
Ulysses!
The people out there are
very nervous, aren't they?
Like the one who does not stop
screaming in another language.
I met one in the city
when I was little.
They're called shamans. These
people know things we do not know.
And I say one thing,
they're harmless.
- The taxi's coming.
Do not go, my lady.
- Cannot.
- Let me through.
- Cannot!
- Let me go.
Your life is in danger!
I need to get to the city!
You don't understand!
I need to get there!
You do not know anything!
Let me go!
Signora!
Help!
Turn off that crap!
Ulysses, there's something
in the hospital.
We need you here!
I need to go with...
Leave me alone!
Help!
Help!
There's something wrong
with the bathroom attendant!
Come on!
He's the devil!
Get away from him!
He's here!
You will have them all!
What the hell did you do?
Signora!
- Signora!
- What's wrong with her?
- What is it?
- We need to know...
if this has ever occurred before.
It looks like epilepsy.
We need something for her to bite on.
She's dead...
What?
Maria, my wife...
She's dead...
She's dead...
Everything all right? I heard screams.
- How long has she been like this?
- Two minutes.
We think it could be
an epileptic seizure.
Of course it's not epilepsy.
Where are you from?
I came by taxi with
a lady and her son.
In a taxi?
Are you still there?
I need you to call for
an ambulance, hurry!
We need to go.
Good luck.
I hope she gets better.
Hey, taxi!
Taxi! Taxi!
Do you think there'll be any
more taxis in this rain?
Be glad you didn't get it.
The driver had a
strange illness.
How long have you been here?
How long have we been here?
Can't you see I'm
with a sick boy?
I'm soaking wet and you can't
even say good evening.
Sorry Signora.
We were expecting a taxi.
It's urgent, we
need an ambulance.
There's an emergency.
Have you looked out the window?
Yes, Signora. The buses are delayed,
we cannot leave here.
I already know there are no buses.
The bandage monster told me.
She's already stabilised.
Thanks for your help.
We did not want to
be selfish, but...
My wife gave birth and...
Best wishes!
Damn everyone else, huh?
They must be from the capital!
Calm down. We all need to
get to the city, right?
Let's go to the ticket office.
and we won't leave without
news of what's hapenning.
- We need a phone.
- This does not work.
She has something
I've never seen.
It's an accelerated
genetic mutation.
It's growing all over the face.
Or didn't you notice it?
We gotta get her to the hospital!
It's also happening with Rosa...
It's that demon!
Devil's son!
We must kill him,
he will do the same to us!
- Sent from Satan!
- What?
Signor, lend me your phone.
It's an emergency.
We have no line!
Not even between seasons.
It is the work of that devil!
Well, we need to find a
phone wherever it is!
Let's go.
No, they cannot leave!
You will not be able to leave!
Why is it closed?
Give me the key.
Do you think I'd be here?
I don't have it!
This demon stole it!
What? I have nothing!
It can't have disappeared.
Why the bandages?
What have you got?
What have I got?
I have this!
Get away from the devil!
Evil seed!
Angel of Satan!
Please, calm down.
Kneel down, Lucifer!
I do not know what it is, sir,
but I swear it is not my fault!
Do not look, darling. Please...
I only work in the mines...
Please do not kill me...
For my children!
How do I stop all this?
- Help me tie him up!
"Tie him up!"
Can't you see she's
having a seizure?
Irene, help me.
The truth is that we do not
understand how it was not reported
by any of the
meteorological centres
which you mentioned, Jorge.
The truth is that the social climate
in the capital is deteriorating,
with repression of students
occurring every day.
Not the rest of the world, of course.
Let's say there is a
chaotic social climate.
And, in my opinion, it
will only get worse.
Look, Jorge, I find Ruben's
comparison ridiculous.
UNAM students have
nothing has to do.
with this hurricane...
There is a virus this season.
That's impossible.
The incubation period
cannot be so short.
Are you a doctor or what?
Yes, I'm a medical student, why?
Student...
I'll get the key.
It's not just this season.
What?
The virus is not the only
thing this season.
The climate of this night and the
social climate in our country
are much more evident.
We are receiving reports of
rising chaos in the streets.
Eighty-nine car accidents
in the metropolitan area alone.
Twelve supermarkets assaulted,
seventeen homicides and
hundreds of wounded.
Our taxi driver had
exactly the same.
His face was bandaged like him,
but it is not a virus.
Shut up!
Tell me to shut up, Mommy!
- Sit down!
- Sit down. Calm!
When you told me,
they did not talk like that!
Ignacio, shut up!
Shut up.
You cannot talk like
that in front of people.
Calm down.
Ignacio, stop!
Ignacio!
Quickly! It's already arrived...
Hurry, it's already here.
The water has arrived...
Quickly!
The water already...
Do you have a prescription for that?
It's special medication.
He has a problem.
What happened?
What about Ignatius?
She brought the virus! It was her!
Leave it! Stop!
What? You're not even a doctor!
I know she brought the virus!
Listen, you idiot!
Here the only virus is you!
You fucking junkie!
I bet you brought the virus!
The country sucks because
of people like you!
You work for the
fucking government?
I told you, I work in a mine!
Is that you? He plays hero,
like the other students.
People like you do not understand!
They all think the same, don't they?
They want us to think
we're the same shit!
And aren't they?
Why are you going on the demonstration?
He goes to Tlatelolco,
like the other idiots,
spread the chaos!
And when arrested,
they are innocent.
It's what you think, that all the
innocents deserve to be arrested!
All the innocents...
- They deserve to be arrested.
Ignacio, shut up.
- To Tlatelolco, Mother. Come on.
- Enough, Ignacio.
Shut up, Ignacio! Enough.
Shut up.
What?
Ignacio's doctor
is in Tlatelolco.
We have nothing to do
with the communes.
There's something very strange here.
I can't find the key.
Calm.
Here, help me.
Stand aside.
Signora, signora...
Help me, she'll suffocate!
Disgusting!
What are you doing, man?
See what happens.
Calm. It is going to be alright.
Take off my bandages!
It's happening again!
Go! Quick!
Take off my bandages!
Help!
Somebody help me, please!
Signora.
Signora, I'm out here.
It's happening again!
Get the bandages off! Already!
Please! It hurts!
Ma'am, I need you
to open the door.
Help me!
I've been shaving for an hour...
but it always grows back!
Signora?
Signora?
Signora, let me see what you got.
What is going on?
Doctor!
What the hell is going on?
Fix this! Please, Doctor!
Fix this!
Doctor!
Fix this! Do not go away!
- You see that too?
- Yes!
It's the devil!
The devil incarnate!
What's the matter with you?
- What?
- What is happening?
Say what's going on!
How should I know?
He's the devil's son!
Kill him!
We must kill him!
Shut up, you son of a bitch!
Shut up!
Tell me how you did it or I'll kill you!
I did nothing!
Did they have American
population control tests done?
I don't know what you're talking about!
- Or the Soviets?
I work in a mine!
Or is it some kind of
hallucinogenic drug?
I already told you that I work
in a mine on Los Filos Hill!
I'm a grocer's manager.
Leave me...
- Be quiet, you bastard!
- Calm down!
Shut up!
Answer me! Is this
American or Soviet?
How does it work?
Was he planning to spread
it over Tlatelolco?
Why start the experiments here?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Let me show you...
Don't move, you bastard!
- Calm down!
He's trying to show you something!
Irene, please! In my suitcase.
My mine ID.
In the back of the suitcase,
inside the wallet!
What wallet?
I only work in a mine.
I have nothing to do
with the government.
I spend half the time here and
half in the capital, I swear!
Be careful!
I swear!
Untie me, please!
Untie me!
No photo has...
Mine sucks!
Tell me how you did it or I'll kill you!
I swear I'll kill you!
- Did what?
- What about the magazines?
Can you explain that?
Magazines? What magazines?
Your plan did not work, did it?
The results should already
be in the capital,
but was prevented by the storm.
Are you going to say it has nothing
to do with this guy's face?
Ignacio, shut up!
Shut up!
What does it have to do with her?
- Anything! Swear!
- I'm not religious!
This doesn't solve anything!
You need to see the magazines!
Did any of you have a drink?
Or is it a gas?
A hallucinogenic gas?
Stop it, you idiot!
He's telling the truth!
Don't you see it too, Ulysses?
See what?
I just want to see my kids!
Please!
You're not seeing anyone, you idiot.
No!
Stop hitting him!
He does not see the same as us!
You're lying! Didn't you notice?
We must search him!
Help me tie him up!
Rosa!
Take it easy, Rosa!
Take it easy!
Tie it!
Rosa!
Rosa!
Rosa, open it!
Rosa!
Go away, Martin!
I don't want anyone
to see me like this!
Open the door, Rosa!
The same thing is
happening to me!
Rosa!
Why do you not try
to make him sleep?
Ignacio does not sleep.
He loves to read.
He spends all night reading
and playing with his dolls.
All the innocents...
deserve to be arrested.
Ignacio.
All the innocents...
deserve to be arrested.
- Ignacio.
Why does he say that?
Untie me, please...
Untie me...
This bastard has
no qualifications.
What a fucking guinea pig
that the government chose.
In the wallet there's a photo...
There's nothing in the wallet!
It's raining outside. There are no buses.
No one will come to help you.
Nothing you say makes sense.
What does the government have to do with this?
How do we know it's not you...
You're doing it.
I would never work for the government.
No one works for the government.
Get that in your skull!
Out of debt, out of danger.
My name is √Ålvaro Garc√≠a Herazo.
I'm 25 years old.
I was born in the capital,
but I study medicine here.
- What else do you want to know?
Why are you going to town?"
For the mass rally
in Tlatelolco.
Any problem with that?
And who are you?
My name is Irene Escudero.
I was a teacher until I got married and
I came to live here three years ago.
What's the matter with you?
Do you think we have
time for presentations?
We must help Rosa!
And me! And that woman!
You still have not told us who you are.
I have nothing to do with anyone.
Anything. I only work at the station.
Not that you do a great job.
My name is... Mart√≠n Aguilar.
I've been sitting in that
ticket office for 30 years.
Two weeks to retirement.
I just want the bus to come
and you to leave me alone!
What about you?
Me what?
Who are you?
Gertrudis Reyes Marks.
I work in the catering industry.
Hang on.
I read an article about you.
I think not.
Yes of course.
You're... that woman.
- The owner of The Pinist.
- Pinist?
The schizophrenic son?
- Don't talk about him like that!
And do not approach, otherwise
I'll call the police!
Do not worry.
I'm just surprised to have the
owner of The Pinist with us.
I'm not the owner. There are several
partners and everyone knows I'm here.
My son is not schizophrenic.
He has an
undiagnosed disorder.
It's the brat from the incident
in the restaurant.
He did not do anything!
It must be because you
give him all these injections.
Of course.
But I warn you, madam,
that if the brat loses
control like that time...
I will not let you create
chaos this time.
It will not happen.
- Let me examine him.
I read the article
and am interested.
I do not want him
touched or infected!
We have a bigger
problem than the boy.
How to make this demon confess?
- My love!
- Shut up!
- Calm. Ignacio!
- Need...
He will transform!
It's normal.
Whenever it rains
he has attacks.
He is terrified of water.
I can't even shower him.
If they are panic
attacks let me help.
Don't approach...
it's not panic.
Is that...
It's as if the water...
- The water is here!
- Ignacio!
The water is here!
The water... is here!
The water is here!
Give it to me or he'll get worse!
Let me go!
The water... is here!
He's getting worse!
- Why inject antipsychotics?
- Get off me!
This rain is not normal!
We must neutralise it now.
Don't you see?
Let me go!
Drop him!
Signora, control yourself!
How do you know if all this
is happening because
of this old witch?
Because he's just like you!
Shut up!
- Shut up!
- Enough, my love.
I'm sure you have high
levels of acetylcholine.
Why do you inject a
neurotransmitter into a child?
You will not tell me
how to heal my son.
Fucking student!
Is it true what they
say in other places
about acid rain?
It has nothing to
do with acid rain.
On the line is Dr.
Emil Rossenstok,
of the Meteorological
Institute of Mexico City,
to explain to us.
Good evening, Dr. Rossenstok.
There is a lot of interference.
Can you hear me?
It has been raining continously for hours.
I recommend you do
not leave your homes.
In London, samples have been analysed
after what happened in Bolivia.
Does this relate to the calls
that have been received?
We've also started
having them here.
This rain contains substances
never seen before.
Avoid exposure to
these substances.
until we have more information.
Something strange is
going on outside.
It's not just here.
Shut up, you bastard!
Untie me, please!
- Shut up, you bastard!
- Stop arguing!
I saw something in the
magazines I want to show everyone.
Irene.
What?
Her too?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Your hair...
It will happen again!
Tell me how to stop it!
She's also infected.
Go there with them.
All Ulysses go behind the column.
Come on.
Signora, we need to get
away from these Ulysses.
What? And miss the feeling
of helping others?
I'd rather die in the rain
than take part in a fucking
government experiment!
Signora, come with me!
Let's run before we
get contaminated!
We're not going
anywhere without a bus.
Don't you see what's going on?
They become Ulysses on a
first-come, first-served basis.
The indigenous woman, the
station guy, Irene...
Then it's us!
We need to get out of here!
Why are the station
windows screened?
I don't know.
Where did the bullets go, damn it?
Where the hell did the bullets go?
- Ignacio, please...
You cannot leave.
Get away! Don't come near me!
All of you keep away!
The only way we can stay, signora...
is to get rid of all Ulysses!
Are you going to kill us all?
Why do they talk about
me in the plural?
We need to report
this experiment!
And quarantine them!
No one will hear
what you have to say now!
Signora?
Signora, fuck, move!
I'm leaving! Fuck you!
I have proof that the same
thing's happening out there.
What proof?
At the ticket office.
If you want to see if this
is the work of the devil...
we have to go back
in the office.
Don't come near me.
Don't move.
Down the hall, open the door.
That woman is crazy.
She'll end up killing her son.
- The boy has problems.
- She's the problem.
He will die if we don't
sedate him.
Of course it's not just rain,
Doctor, it's a hurricane!
I am saying that the substances
found in these drops
have nothing to do with the
composition of the H2O molecule
as we know it.
What I want to say is that
this rain is not water.
This rain does not come
from the CO2 of the clouds.
Signora, you've seen
everyone here is crazy.
Untie me, please...
If you talk again,
I'll break your face.
Ignacio, come here.
Rosa!
Rosa!
Rosa!
Ignacio, come back here!
Rosa, wake up!
Rosa!
ENGLAND 1966 WORLD CUP
No wonder Martin was so scared.
Rosa, wake up!
Ignacio, open the door.
Ignacio!
Open the door and let me out!
Ignacio!
Open the door!
He promised he would
not do it again!
Open the door and let me out!
Open the fucking door!
Open the door!
Hey boy!
Boy!
Help me please!
Untie me.
Untie me.
Untie me.
What?
What are you doing?
Hey! Boy!
Boy! Can you hear me?
Untie me
Ignacio!
I'm going to get you and
your mother out of here.
Untie me.
I can help you!
Hey! Listen?
- No!
- Untie me...
Untie me
What are you doing?
What?
What are you doing?
No!
Open the door!
Open the fucking door!
Promised he would not do it again!
You promised...
Open the door!
How did he lock the door
if he did not have the key?
He won't let us out.
You need to understand.
He's just joking, for
him it's a joke,
but I never thought it
would go that far...
Your son...
Are you doing this?
I don't know...
It has something to do with the rain.
I can't protect you anymore!
He's going to kill us!
He's always had the
power since he was small,
but never something like this,
so at first I didn't
think it was him!
Shut up and let me read.
This is the story my mother
read to me when I was little.
Do you want me to read it?

"From that day,"
"and for the rest of
our existence..."
"everything had changed."
"Life on planet Earth would
never be the same again."
"But at the same time..."
"also everything... was the same."
"End."
This is what I saw.
Look at the magazines.
Do you want to leave?
I can tell you who has the keys.
But if I tell you...
you will have to kill him.
Do you still think
it's government work?
Of course yes!
Someone planted these things.
Ulysses is not alone.
What?
Is this also the work of the government?
They are my parents.
And if you don't kill
him in five minutes,
I will make the others die too.
This can't be!
Look.
What were you doing with the boy?
- Tie him up!
- What?
- The boy isn't human!
- What did you say?
The boy is doing it!
Tie him up!
I will not tie him up!
Tie him up!
And you, you idiot!
If you try anything, I'll
blow your brains out!
I'll get the key.
The keys, idiot!
I don't have them!
Don't be stupid.
They're in your pocket!
Someone put them there!
- It was Ignacio.
- Shut up!
Everyone out!
Get out! Let's go!
Quickly!
Hurry, you bastard!
Rosa...
Let's go!
Ignacio...
What did the man who
was tied up tell you?
Ignacio, why did you untie him?
- Quick, you motherfuckers!
- He's the devil!
The battle has begun!
Whoever has the gun has the power!
All innocents deserve
to be arrested.
Stop, Ignacio! Please!
I need to give him his medicine!
It's the only way! Please!
This miserable kid is doing it!
All innocents deserve
to be arrested!
And this bastard helps him!
I had the keys!
What's the explanation?
He wants to kill me...
I don't want to kill anyone!
Bunch of freaks!
I just want to get out of here!
All innocents deserve
to be arrested!
- The battle has begun!
- Ulysses.
- Who has the gun, has the power!
- Untie me.
All innocents deserve
to be arrested!
This place is cursed and
the boy's miserable too.
The doors don't open.
Didn't you see that even
bullets don't work?
Ulysses...
Did you forget our deal?
Ignacio!
Hello, Doctor.
That's why your bullets failed
You were in the wrong
place, Doctor.
What did you say?
There, there... and there.
You promised to control yourself!
Ignacio, please! Stop now!
Give me his medicine!
Give it now!
- Give it here! What are you doing?
- Where's the medicine?
Here you are, Mom.
Ignacio, don't...
No!
Listen to me.
It's not yourself.
Something is controlling you.
Remember what happened
at the restaurant?
Remember promising the doctor
not to admit he's your father?
Remember, dear?
I do not remember.
No! Untie me!
Irene! Help!
Untie me
Yes...
Quickly!
Ulysses...
Will not you fulfill your
part of the agreement?
No! Ignacio, no!
Run!
Something horrible is going to happen!
Run!
Come here, you bastard!
Tell me what you know
about my family!
Ulysses, let it go!
For your sake let it go!
I don't think you can leave here.
As you have not fulfilled your
part of the agreement,
you no longer have the keys.
Since I do not have the keys...
The keys...
What is happening?
What?
- What have?
- Ignacio, please stop!
Ignacio, stop now!
I'll kill you!
Fuck it's a boy!
I do not think you can shoot me,
because there is no
longer the shotgun.
Ignacio, please! Stop now!
Move...
Get out of the way.
I can't control it, get out!
Ignacio, stop already!
Ignacio! Already! Stop!
Go!
I can't control it!
Go!
The radio is closing down
and we need to go.
Please do not leave!
And remember to avoid
mirrors at all costs.
President Diaz Ordaz
has just said in his
emergency braodcast...
to avoid any contact
with the rain
and with people already infected.
In a few moments...
... at all costs.
Panic is taking
over the streets.
People are turning...
...a Mexican face with
a moustache and beard,
and the hospitals are only...
The reason for this
event is unknown.
It has been reported in the USA,
Europe, around the world...
Get away from the mirrors!
Closing this station.
We will be transferred.
Dr Rossenstok confirms that...
Help!
Get me out of this station!
Ignacio...
me too?
Ulysses!
Take it easy...
Breathe. Do not move.
He forced me...
Who are you?
It's me, Alvaro.
I'm Irene, Ulysses.
No...
Don't you see it?
We are like you!
We are all like you!
No... they're crazy...
Why do not you recognize your face?
Breathe.
Show him this.
Ulysses...
What do you see?
What do you see?
No...
That...
It's not me... I'm not...
It's not me...
What's happened to my face?
What happened... on my face?
It's not me...
What happened...
...my face?
What happened to my face...
Hold on! Look here!
In my wallet...
It was not me...
I swear...
It wasn't me...
He forced me...
He was controlling me!
It wasn't me...
The wallet...
No!
It can't be...
He's Ulysses. It can only be him.
He was the first to be transformed.
It must have been him.
When we first met, she told
me she had passed out.
"How did you not realize?"
- Do not know.
Why did you see it now?
What is happening?
Are they normal?
The two normal?
- Both normal?
- It can not be...
And the boy!
No, please!
Please do not hurt him!
- Get away!
- Please!
He's just kidding!
Stop the joke!
It does not work,
it controls them!
No, I control that!
And you're coming with
us to the office.
No...
Because I?
Because she's the
only one who did not.
Quickly! Let's go!
Say what you see.
What do you see in the
photos and posters?
Say what you see, damn it!
Photos...
A poster of Mar√≠a Felix.
The James Bond actor, I can
not remember his name.
The Capulina, The Beatles
and Marilyn Monroe.
But with the face of this man.
Are you sure you see
them with that face?
- Yes.
"And what do you see?"
I do not see Ulysses' face.
Me neither.
It's my fault...
It's like Ignacio's story.
Which history?
It's a story I used
to tell him...
He drew them with
his imagination.
You're recreating it...
making it a reality.
What are you saying?
You have already
lost your identity.
That's why they do
not see the alike.
Soon everything will be normal...
and they will forget it.
"Normal", how?
Yes, the photos
will look normal.
And soon...
their normal faces.
But how could Ulysses
see us like this?
I don't know.
I don't know, it could be because...
he was dying. Don't know.
I don't understand, but you will make him
stop or I swear I'm going to kill him.
I can not stop him!
Do you not see?
I'm turning myself too!
All we can do...
is not anger him.
My love.
You need to stop it.
You've killed a person.
I can't, Mother.
They took over.
Who?
I'm thinking of other things
so they won't remember that I am here.
I'm fooling them.
Please do not call them.
- Say what "they" are!
- Let him!
- No!
- Say what's going on!
Don't annoy him!
- Leave me alone!
No! I cannot concentrate!
They will come back!
Who is coming back?
Shut up! I don't want to!
Shut up!
It was your fault, he does not want to!
She does not!
Calm down!
It's gonna be okay.
Come on, Irene!
I don't want this!
There, breathe!
Breathe, Irene!
Breathe!
Here it comes!
Irene!
Irene, no!
Irene, wake up! No!
Irene!
Wake up!
They made me!
Irene!
Irene...
I'm leaving.
What do we do with her?
Irene said that her boyfriend was
coming to pick her up by car.
- Martin!
- Look out!
- Get away!
- What?
Get away from there!
Go!
Go!
Get up!
Ignacio. My love...
Wake up. Ignacio!
Ignacio!
Ignacio!
He's not breathing...
Ignacio?
Ignacio continued...
using too much energy.
You were in contact...
with great beings.
Very great.
I thought they did not exist.
I thought it was just in the books.
He did not know that his joke
would affect the whole world.
All the earth, all people.
He did not want to hurt,
he had no control.
I know.
I know...
And what happens now?
Nothing.
Nothing happens.
Sorry, Detective Reyes.
Any ideas?
No, nothing yet.
We received many calls
during the rain,
but nothing like this maniac.
You know I'm against
the death penalty...
but for this animal...
Get her.
He made us look alike!
It was him, I swear it wasn't me!
Sir?
The expert found this in
the murderer's coat.
We're looking for a hallucinogen far more
powerful than this sack of grass.
I don't think we'll find anything.
He must have taken it all.
The drug made him kill 5 people?
Why?
How would I know why?
He was on drugs and was
going to the capital.
I should be going to Tlatelolco.
And the story of the
boy and the "similars"?
With the drugs that young
people today use...
- Look.
What have things come to?
If a 25-year-old man
commits these crimes,
We're in the shit.
So it has to do with what
happens in the capital
and with the demonstration
in Tlatelolco.
And the baby? Is it ok?"
- Of course.
That poor orphan was taken away
from the station several hours ago.
Right.
And what will we do with
the mother and the son?
Can you let them go in that state?
- What can I do?
I don't know, they're witnesses.
- The culprit has already been arrested.
We have his prints on the
gun and the vehicle.
So let them go.
They say that after the
storm comes the calm.
But for Ignacio,
an 8-year-old boy
who was always different
from the others,
this calm will never come.
Nor for all who accompany
him on this planet...
either.
Because Ignacio feels
things we do not feel.
He knows things we do not know.
And he sees things that we...
we do not see.
Now sleep in the bus.
We'll see Dr. Rafael.
I need some eggs and
some good coffee.
My head hurts a lot.
How strange, me too.
It must have been the rain.
What a strange nightmare.
And with that power, Ignacio
has just changed everything,
even if no one remembers
or can repair it.
What to him was just
a child's play,
just changed everything forever.
And now there are more
than 3,500 million people
that will never
be the same again.
Or rather, they will
always be the same.
He knows there are
always traces.
He knows there are always some
who will remember his exploits.
But the last one was too strong.
THE SIMILARS
MASSACRE IN THE SQUARE
THE EARTHQUAKE DISASTER
THE GREAT WAVE
THE INCIDENT
MEDICAL RECORD FOR EVALUATION
AND PREVENTIVE PROCEDURE.
THE PATIENT MUST DO...
Tlatelolco.
You cannot go to the
doctor today, Ignacio boy.
Many people!
It's too dangerous
to be with them!
Let him rest. Can't you
see he had a rough night?
Martin was not the important
character in this story.
He was just another pawn
in someone else's game.
Everyone was just another pawn.
Ignacio is the important
character of this story.
Ignacio is the
important character
in EVERY story.
Innocent people will
suffer serious problems
with his visit to this city.
Nobody can stop him,
because nobody knows of
his ruthless control.
He is simply...
one of those unknown dangers
that exist on planet Earth,
without explanation.
There are many, many more.
Or, at least...
so it would seem.
END
THE SIMILARS
