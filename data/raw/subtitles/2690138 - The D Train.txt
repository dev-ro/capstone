Check-check.
Check-check.
-Hey, Dan.
-Jerry.
-New sign?
-Same sign, Jerry. New suction cups.
Come on.
I was actually calling about
the reunion....
Hi. This is Craig Manheim
from Barklidge High School. Is this...?
Jesus, dude, how many times
have you been married?
Bring them all.
May I speak with
Jeff Suddleson please?
Jeff? Dan Landsman,
from high school.
The D Man! No? Nothing?
Neil Boydras, D Money!
Dan.... Landsman.
It was a nickname, man,
everyone used to call me that.
Yes, they did. They definitely did.
Class of '94?
Yes, there we go.
No, I don't think I still suck.
Yes, it's that time.
-Twenty years, can you believe it?
-We sent out a paper invitation...
...followed by an Evite
and a link to the Facebook page.
You did? Great! But you're not.... Got it.
It seemed to be
a little indecision in your voice.
I'm gonna see if I can flip you to a yes.
Okay. That's not very mature.
Craig? Randy?
-So....
-I'm up for beers.
What are you guys doing?
You guys grabbing beers, or...?
-I don't think....
-I'm gonna head home, myself.
Yeah. So.... maybe next time.
-All right, buddy.
-Okay. Okay.
-You going?
-Yeah, I'll follow you.
Well, I'm asking you
what is the future of Pirate baseball?
Here in Pittsburgh, we know
that we can't spend as much on salary.
So they constantly have guys
that they develop that leave Pittsburgh.
You know what?
You can't bring Dave Parker back.
You can't bring back Willie Stargell.
You gotta go with what got you there.
You gotta go with prospects.
Do you think McCutchen is enough
to lead this team to a World Series?
-Did they invite you for drinks?
-No.
Did you tell them that
you wanted to go, like we talked about?
Yeah. They just weren't going tonight.
I thought they said that last time,
but then you drove by and you saw them.
They weren't doing that this time.
Zach, wanna tell your dad
about your new girlfriend?
-Girlfriend?
-She's not my girlfriend.
I just heard this girl, Heather, likes me.
She's older. I told him
he should ask her out.
You think I should?
I'd do a little more investigating.
These girls, usually like older guys.
I think that's what
I'm bumping up against.
But put some feelers out there.
I did. And her friend said it's true.
Yeah, well, you never know.
I mean, the friend could be lying.
Why would she lie?
Could be a prank planned to get you
to ask her out, then they'll laugh at you.
-Dan!
-What?
I'm just preparing him for certain
realities of high school.
Come on.
Come on!
What the fuck is this?
What happened? I don't get this.
-Bill, have you got a second?
-Oh, yeah, Daniel, come on in.
I hate to bring this up again, but the
Internet connection is beyond frustrating.
-What do you mean, the cord?
-No, not the cord, the speed.
We gotta get with it, you know?
That's why we lost the Harkin account.
I went to high school with Dale Harkin,
and he won't work with us?
The reason we lost the Harkin account
is because Dale's dad is a liar.
-Dale's dad is a perjurer.
-And he wants things faster. He e-mails.
I've been doing this job for 40 years
without a computer, and I'm doing fine.
Okay. But what happened to the Bill
Shurmur I always wanted to work for?
The Bill Shurmur who always loved
catching that big fish?
Daniel. I get it.
I hear you. I just don't have
the funds for these toys.
I can't! Don't do that.
That's not fair. Come here.
-You're my guy. You know that, right?
-Yeah, but....
And you've been telling me
to think bigger for-- For years.
But I need to have a little more
cash-ola first.
And then, I promise you....
The Dan Plan is a go. I promise you.
Get out of here.
We've got items at crazy prices.
Now on sale at Cabinets-To-Go.
We've got solid wood,
high-quality kitchen cabinets...
...with features like
self-closing European style hardware...
...dovetail joints,
and guaranteed moisture....
Come on in. You'll find the quality--
The ocean and the sun.
Both beautiful....
Both deadly.
Now, the ocean,
I can keep that safe pretty easily.
But the sun....
The ocean and the sun.
Both beautiful.... Both deadly.
Stacey! Honey!
This is my beach.
And I need to protect it.
Now, the ocean,
I can keep that safe pretty easily.
But the sun....
I leave that to Banana Boat
triple defense sun screen for men.
-What?
-You didn't notice anything there?
I don't know what we're looking for.
Fucking Lawless! Oliver Lawless!
-From high school?
-Yes, from high school!
On a national commercial!
He did it! He made it!
-That was one of Daddy's good friends.
-Really?
-No. It was not!
-He was a friend.
This is what you woke us up for?
Goddamn it, Dan.
It's gonna take me a half an hour
to put her back to bed!
-Go to sleep Zach, please.
-All right.
Let's watch it one more time.
--sun screen for men.
-Dad, can I ask you about Heather?
-Not now, Zach. We're watching.
Seen it a bunch now.
-It's crazy, right?
-Yeah, I guess.
You guess? How many of your buddies
are in a national TV spot? Come on.
And.... I'm recording.
-The ocean and the sun....
-No. No, no, no. Stop.
Start earlier, then hit play, then exit so
the bar goes away before it starts, okay?
Let's do it again.
Run it back. Back it up.
-And give me some volume.
-But Mom said that I....
Don't worry about Mom. Come on, Zach.
One more time, we're so close.
And.... Play.
Banana Boat, the only boat en route
to protecting your skin.
-Excuse me.
-Good?
Zachary!
Hang up the phones.
Hang up the phones.
-Okay, boop.
-Jesus Christ!
-What are you doing?
-And.... Boop.
-What the fuck?!
-I'll tell you what the fuck, Randy.
D Fresh has an idea.
-Who's D Fresh?
-It's me, Jerry. Focus.
I have an idea.
It's gonna take this thing
to the next level...
...and get every single person
from our class to RSVP yes.
-How?
-Bring up the reunion Facebook page.
-Everyone gather around.
-Gather around?
-Come on. Chop, chop!
-Why would we do that?
Press play for me, Taj?
And, full screen it for me, Taj?
-Beautiful.
-What the fuck is this?
-Is that Oliver Lawless?
-Yes!
It's Oliver Lawless.
He's a big Hollywood actor now.
We get Lawless to come,
the whole class will follow.
It's like one of those bullshit charity events.
They bring out the celebrities.
If Dave Schwimmer goes,
everyone goes!
Look.
As Chairman of the Alumni Committee--
There is no chairman, Dan.
Then why am I the one with administrator
access to the Facebook page?
Because you set it up
and you won't give it to anyone?
Whatever! I'm telling you,
he's the answer here, guys.
Okay. Let's just assume
that you're right...
...and I'm not saying that you are...
...but let's just--
Let's assume it for a second.
How are we supposed to get him?
He hasn't responded to anything.
Maybe I should be the one reaching out.
We're old friends....
-You were not friends with Lawless.
-Oh, was I not, Randy?
Is that why he sent me the video?
Because we weren't friends?
-You could have recorded it. Off your TV.
-That's obviously what he did.
Guys, we're getting away
from the issue.
Okay. Okay. How about we
go to the other issue then.
The one where you're, like, lying
about being friends with Lawless.
I don't need this.
I'm going to get my friend
Oliver Lawless to come to this reunion.
And then we'll see
which issue is which.
What?
Oliver! What's up, dude?
Haven't seen you in a long time, bro.
Since high school?
Has it been that long? Jeez!
So, looking very likely
I'll be heading out to the west side on biz.
Thought maybe we could grab
some brews on the old expense account.
Holla at me, dog!
You can message me here or you
can hit me up on my e-mail. Peace.
D Rock.
-Good morning, Shelly.
-Hey, Daniel.
James.
Los Angeles businesses.
Drazen Partners. Why not?
Kent Drazen. Hello, sir.
Bill, you got a sec?
-Yeah. Come on in.
-Got an exciting prospect.
This firm in L.A.
just fired their whole team....
I got wind of it, made a couple calls,
had a pretty substantial e-mail exchange...
...with the CEO, Kent Drazen. He wants
me to fly out there and meet him.
Check out the e-mail. Kent Drazen.
-The CEO.
-I guess....
-I pressed something here.
-No problem. It'll get it right back.
There it is.
-Forget it, I don't....
-Is that better?
-You can see it.
-No. I hate those.
Well...
...right here he says he likes doing things
the old fashioned way, face-to-face.
Reminds me of you, Bill.
He says, "I would love to do business with
your company." That's a strong e-mail.
-You have an instinct here, Daniel?
-I do. This could be big.
-Let's do it.
-Yeah?
Yeah. You book two tickets. Economy.
Well.... You wanna...?
Yeah, I should meet him.
Oh, yeah. Well, I mean,
I hope that doesn't spook him, but....
Why would it spook him?
Well, let me check the airline.
See if I can grab you a seat.
Thursday flights. Sold out,
sold out, sold out....
Cross-checking with
the other carriers.... Nothing.
And you can see that on the phone?
It's a new app. We tried.
-Hold on.
-It looks like a solo mission this time.
I got an idea. Let me call Roselle.
She's been my travel agent....
She's gonna be looking at
the same screen I'm looking at.
Never hurts to try. I gotta tell you,
I don't trust the web.
Yeah. Roselle please.
-Is it a soul patch?
-Zach, don't drag the suitcase.
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.
-This is huge.
-You found this guy. Does Bill know that?
-Yeah. He knows.
-Gonna have time to do anything cool?
-Zach, this is a business trip.
Get the suitcase out.
You're gonna kill it. I'm so proud of you.
-Who was doubting himself?
-I was.
-And who told you that you shouldn't?
-You did.
-I love you.
-Love you.
Daddy's got a business trip.
Ladies and gentlemen, in a few minutes
I'll come through to offer you a beverage.
This is a nice plane.
Yeah. Glad Roselle
was able to get you a seat.
Yeah, right away. I told you,
online it's a crap shoot.
I wanna go over the itinerary
just once more with you.
Okay. We land at 4:40...
...there should be a Marathon
Rent-a-Car shuttle at baggage claim.
We go, we.... You okay?
Are you nervous?
No. I haven't heard from
Drazen actually...
...ever since I e-mailed him
that you were joining. Yeah....
Next time you e-mail him,
can you add me to it?
I've seen those
where there's multiple....
Yeah, the thing about that is,
if it doesn't start as a group thing...
-...it's tough to add someone later.
-Oh, that makes sense.
-Two rooms?
-Two rooms.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
Hi, I'd like to leave a message
for Bill Shurmur...
...it's from Kent Drazen, "Meeting
canceled." Oh, hold on one sec.
-Hello?
-Is this Daniel?
-Oliver! What's up? Can you hold on?
-I guess.
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. Go.
I'll call you back.
Dude!
-What's up, Daniel?
-Not much. Actually, I go by Dan now.
Oh, great.
Right? Yeah, it's shorter.
Daniel is kind of....
-Yeah, man, Dan's better.
-Thank you. Glad you like it.
So, what's up, Dan? Why did you call?
Well, like I said on my VM,
I'm in town on business.
-Okay....
-Hey, you wanna get a beer?
This week's kind of tough
for me. How long you in town for?
-Just a couple days actually.
-You coming out again this year?
No. I don't have that planned at all.
All right, fuck it, I'll meet you.
-Redbury in 30.
-Redbury. Okay.
Is that a...? You know what?
I'll find it. Hello?
Sir? Again, if your whole party's not here....
I'm gonna need the couch.
He's parking right now.
Please, just cut me a little slack?
-Three minutes.
-Thank you.
-Dan?
-Dude, yeah!
-What's up?
-How are you?
-You all right?
-Yeah. I got us a couch.
Yeah, let's sit at the bar.
I'm not gonna need the couch.
It's a little consulting firm.
I'm meeting with a big firm...
...hoping they'll contract us to....
-This is boring, what am I rambling about?
-I have no idea, man.
You.... are killing it, sir.
"Banana Boat is the only boat...
...en route to protecting your skin."
Fucking sick, bro!
-Yeah, it turned out all right.
-All right?
You have any idea how many people are
out here trying to do what you're doing?
And do you know
how many of them fail?
Good for you, dog.
Just like in high school.
"There's Lawless.
What's he doing? Stepping back for 3."
Boom! Swish!
Fuck. I haven't
thought about that in a while.
You know what? You should come to
the reunion. Twenty years, coming up.
-No, man. That's not my thing.
-Yeah....
Damn!
You must be crushing on out here
with the talent level off the charts.
And the acting thing
must help with the girls, huh?
Girls and guys.
-What with guys?
-Well....
-I mean....
-Are you gay, dude?
-I mean it's totally cool if you are.
-I'm not into labels. You know, I....
-I like whatever.
-Cool. Cool.
Scoops section lists several
approaches to online privacy.
Along with conventional wisdom
about each one.
I've never taken a muscle relaxant before.
Down the old hatch.
It's a good buzz when you booze.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm feeling it already.
So you got married
right after high school?
College actually.
We got pregnant and then
bought a house down in Clarkstown.
It's a nice area. You know.
Good schools.
-And you married Stacey Polster?
-Fourteen years.
-She was cute.
-Yeah.
She was no Holly James, but....
Fuck you, man, Holly James.
-It's been a while since I heard that name.
-I bet.
-Her pussy, man....
-Yeah?
So tight. Like almost too tight.
Oh, shit.
-Hey, she'll be there.
-Where?
At the reunion! You should come!
Fuck that tight pussy again.
-She'd be all over my shit, wouldn't she?
-Totally!
-There's no way I'm going to that.
-No?
Okay.
Yeah.
-I don't really....
-All right, make a fist.
Okay. Here we go.
Now you just snort it?
All right. Here we go.
Shit. Is that Dermot Mulroney?
Oh, yeah, that is Dermot.
Wait a second. You just called him
Dermot. Are you guys friends?
Well.... Yeah.
That is so weird how you guys
all know each other.
-Hollywood's big, but the business is....
-Small. Right.
You should go talk to him.
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Go.
-Yeah, I probably should go say hi.
-Yeah.
Hey, what's up, buddy?
How you doing?
Do we know each other?
No. No, no.
I'm just a big fan of your work.
Man, thanks. Thanks a lot.
-I'm an actor too, so....
-Right on, brother. It's great seeing you.
-I'm in a Banana Boat ad right now.
-Cool.
-Did you ever do any commercials or...?
-No.
No, I started in studio films.
Yeah. Of course you did.
I've seen every one of them.
Thanks a lot. Thank you.
Well, Dermot Mulroney.
Good to see you. Oliver.
Oh, Oliver. Good to meet you, man.
All right, man. You guys, keep rocking.
-What happened? What did he say?
-We were just talking shit.
He wanted me to sit down, I was like,
"I gotta go, man, my buddy's here, so...."
You don't wanna get caught up in that,
man. He'll eat up your whole night.
-Let's get another drink.
-All right, dude.
-Hello?
-Hey, honey.
-What are you doing? It's 4 in the morning.
-Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
Hey, did you see my Facebook?
I posted a new pic. You gotta check it out.
-Dan, I am sleeping.
-Oh, please, honey....
Just go down there
to the computer real quick, honey, please.
Christ.
-You've gotta be kidding me.
-You on there yet?
-Babe, you on there?
-I just walked into the living room.
-Okay.
-Are you on there now?
-Wait, is that...?
-Yes, it is. Oliver Lawless.
I'm hanging out with him.
And we just saw Dermot Mulroney,
and he seems like a normal, regular dude.
Well, that's great, honey,
but how was the meeting?
What meeting? Oh, right.
Good. Really, really good.
Okay, wow. So, is it happening?
Oh, you know, it's close.
There's contingencies.
-I'm cooked, man.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, I gotta go.
I'll talk to you tomorrow. Love you, bye.
-Dude. I'm sorry, man. Best night ever.
-Great fucking night.
Wanna do it again?
-Absolutely man. Take care.
-Tomorrow night? Bring Dermot?
Yeah. I'll text him.
-The reunion?
-No. All right, brother.
Hello?
-What's up, man? You okay?
-Yeah. Can I come in?
Get in here!
-The mini-bar?
-I don't think I have one.
Fuck. Right here. Yeah.
Is that what it is? Help yourself.
Fifteen bucks a bottle, no big deal.
-I fucking couldn't sleep, man.
-Yeah. Me neither.
Dan, you ever feel like you're just....
You're just lying to yourself?
-What do you mean?
-And when you're lying to yourself...
...you're lying to the whole world.
And that's a shit heavy thing
to carry around.
It's like, do you ever feel like you're
so on the same page with someone...
...that you don't even know
what to say to that person?
Ask me why I'm here, Oliver.
Why I'm really here.
You're here for
your business thing, right?
That's what my wife thinks.
That's what my boss...
...who's sleeping right above us, thinks.
But the truth is...
...I came here to get you
to come to our high school reunion.
I'm on the alumni committee, Oliver.
I'm actually
chairman of the damn thing.
-Jesus.
-And I told them...
...if I got you to come,
that everyone else would too.
You really think they give a shit?
Are you kidding? They'd shit themselves.
You're Oliver Lawless.
Yeah, whatever that means.
Okay.
Do you know what I did
when I graduated high school?
I went to community college
down the street from high school.
Took the first job I got.
I never left home.
I did what every other asshole did.
But not you.
You said fuck it.
You went after your dream.
And you fucking fulfilled it!
You're the Banana Boat spokesman.
Excuse me?
Banging hot chicks all over town,
boys with Mulroney?
You are the best thing that ever
came out of Barklidge, bro, by a long shot.
And if you come to this thing...
...you will be giving
those people a gift...
...that they will remember
for the rest of their pathetic lives.
So, what did you...?
-What did you tell your boss?
-Oh, no. No. I'm so fucked.
I told him that there's this CEO
in town that wants to work with us.
Why would you do that?
I didn't think he would come.
It's so stupid.
-What are you gonna do about it?
-I don't know.
But he's gonna find out
that I made up the whole thing.
Well, maybe he doesn't have to.
Thank you, Mr. Drazen,
for reconsidering. That's very kind of you.
Well, first of all, call me Kent.
Let's get that out of the way.
And can I just say, this man is a super star.
Did I tell you that already?
He single-handedly got me excited
about this. And I don't get excited easy.
-Yeah, that's Daniel.
-Thanks, Mr. Drazen.
Now, let me tell you why
this still isn't gonna happen.
I talked to the board, we ran
the numbers forward and backward...
...and we really wanted
to make this work.
But, sadly,
we are just maxed out right now.
-Damn.
-Now, here's what I propose.
We put a pin in it, all right?
We come back next fiscal, when the flow
is a little healthier, we revisit.
I like that. That sounds great.
Thank you, Mr.-- Kent.
Hang on one second, Daniel.
I won't be able to sleep if I don't say this:
There's gotta be a way to make this work.
Bill, you know, they ran the numbers.
The numbers have been run.
Sorry. I'm very sorry.
How about if we cut our fee?
All right? Twenty-five percent.
That's very generous, but,
I'm afraid it still won't get it done.
-Fifty percent.
-Bill, can we even...?
Come on, Kent.
We both know this deal makes sense.
And this guy can deliver.
So I just don't know how
you can say no to this deal.
-Man, I don't know what to say.
-Say yes.
-Okay. You got yourself a deal.
-Yes. That's it.
This feels right. This makes sense.
You see? Okay. Well, I'm shaking.
I'm a little shaky as well.
I'm gonna get the best champagne
this place has.
All right.
Fuck me! That was awesome!
We just had a back and forth,
it just fucking evolved.
That was great. That was great.
I didn't go too far, did I?
That felt natural to me.
Yeah. I mean, you know, the part where
you accepted the deal was a little bit....
-Yeah, but it was real.
-Oh, yeah.
If I said no, it would have been totally
false. He would've seen right through it.
Yeah, maybe. I mean, I was buying
the whole "out of cash" argument. But....
That was fucking good, man.
No, well, I mean, Dan, that's fine.
You get to look great, nobody gets hurt.
-Well, Bill....
-Are you kidding me? Look at him.
He's having the time of his life.
The guy couldn't be happier. Come on,
look. We're in the cat bird seat, okay?
We can pull the plug whenever we want.
Either way there's no deal.
Just get that in your head. No deal.
Why not let it sit for a little bit.
Have a little fun with it, you know?
-Yeah. Maybe you're right.
-Maybe? Fuck you. Damn right I'm right.
Now, we're gonna celebrate.
We're gonna drink some bubbly.
And then tomorrow you call him
and say it's off.
Yeah, whenever we wanna do it.
A week from now, do it tomorrow....
-No rush. But the sooner the better.
-Yeah. We're gonna celebrate tonight!
-You don't know who that is?
-I don't!
-You didn't see his national commercial?
-No.
Banana Boat. He's the Banana Boat guy.
That's the fucking guy!
Yeah. That guy is this guy
and this guy is that guy.
We're friends from high school.
-What's up, Eton?
-Eton.
Billy! KD here.
Wanted to say it was a pleasure meeting
you, and I look forward to doing some biz.
Drazen. Out.
Hey, ladies!
-Give me that.
-It's so good.
-No, no, no. Come on.
-Oh, sorry.
You gotta find the right spot.
-All right. This is cool. Thank you.
-All right.
-Oh, fuck!
-Oh, my God!
Dude.
I haven't had a night like that
in a long time.
Oh, man, I had such a blast too.
Dan...
...thank you, man.
Oh. Thank you, man.
Come here.
All right.
-I'll come to the reunion.
-Oh, my God.
-Hey, bro.
-Hey.
That was a fun night last night, man.
Yeah.
-You want some coffee or something?
-No, no, I'm good.
Oh, shit, I gotta take this.
What's up, babe?
What are you doing?
Just waking up.
Yeah. My phone died. Sorry, babe.
What did you get into last night?
Yeah? Was it fun?
-T-shirt?
-Second drawer.
I texted you.
Fuck you. You're full of shit.
Check your phone.
Babe. How was it?
Come on, baby, not again.
It's too early for this shit.
I did nothing.
I gotta....
-Just give me a sec.
-My flight.
Hang on a second.
All right, man.
All right, just come pick me up.
We'll go from here.
It doesn't matter....
Mimosa? Mimosa?
What a trip, huh?
Closing that deal
like the old days, huh? Yeah.
Here we go. One of the perks
of first class travel.
You earned it, Dan boy.
Mimosa?
Congratulations!
Bill must be thrilled.
Did you ask for a raise?
Not yet. It just happened.
Well, you gotta ask him about it.
This is all because of you.
I know. I will.
What about Lawless?
Did you get him to come?
-What?
-Is he gonna come to the reunion?
Possibly.
I mean...
...he wants to, but it's a big expense,
have to fly him out here and put him up....
What's this?
There are no buttons on this shirt.
That's weird. Were there buttons
on there when you bought it?
Yes, I wouldn't buy a shirt
without buttons.
So, what goes on now?
People just try shit on
and then throw it on the ground?
Step on stuff...
...buttons come off, and they just
put it on the rack and sell it?
Okay. I'll return it tomorrow.
Are you gonna say something? Something
needs to be said to the manager.
Because that's fucking bullshit!
Fuck!
It's Lawless.
Ollie! D Smooth.
What's up, my brother?
Hey, that was some fucking
fun-ass shit out there in L.A.
L.A. is, like.... A great place. Shit.
So, give me a call back,
I wanna talk reunion with you.
I'm feeling like, the more I think about it,
the lamer it gets, you know?
Thinking about bailing on
the whole thing, to be honest.
Who needs to see all those.... Clowns.
So, yeah, give me a call back. I'll shoot you
an SMS as well. All right, peace, bro.
-Two, three....
-What's going on? What is all this stuff?
These are brand new computers.
Top of the line, just like you wanted.
Putting the Dan Plan into action.
We're gonna give the office a facelift,
hip up the place.
Well, that's....
Great. But do you think we're
getting ahead of ourselves?
What if the deal falls through?
We haven't signed the paperwork yet.
No, no, no, it's as good as done.
No, I'm a very good judge of people.
And I.... I trust Drazen.
-Yeah, I do too....
-And guess what?
-I sent Dale Harkin an e-mail.
-Get the fuck out of here.
I told him about the Drazen deal...
...about what's going on here
and he wants another meeting.
Oh, man. You-- You scored. Danny.
I am so proud of you, bucko.
-Thanks, I....
-Enjoy. This is for you. You feel good?
Yeah. I'm starting to feel good.
What's this?
Dan, let me just start by
sucking a little shit here.
-Lawless RSVP'd.
-And then a bunch of others RSVP'd.
Yeah, and I've turned several no's
into maybe's.
Several no's now maybes,
because of you, your plan.
-Well, thanks, guys, but....
-We doubted you, pal.
We wanna apologize for that.
Can we just skip this bullshit
and go celebrate?
-Yeah. Yeah, we should.
-Yeah.
All right, yeah.
After you, big man.
So walk us through it.
You go out there, you call him....
-He answers, you say what?
-How'd you turn him?
You know, it was a delicate dance,
guys. It was just, I think...
...the key was making it seem like
it was his idea.
-How?
-How?
-Exactly.
-How exactly did you do that?
You know, I don't even really remember.
I just sort of flipped the script...
...sort of like a reverse psychology,
and a subtle thing I did.
And then all of a sudden
he was eating out of the palm of my hand.
"Oh, dude, when is it, D Slice?
What do I wear?"
I was like, "Calm down."
"It's not for a few weeks,
we'll be in touch."
But, fuck, he's been blowing me up
ever since.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah?
We should do that more often.
Well, what are those?
CK. Boxer-brief hybrid. You like?
Yeah. They're really cute.
Look at that tush.
You're over Big Ben? You're over
Big Ben, the guy has two Super Bowls!
I'm over Big Ben.
I'm not resting on the laurels....
You are just the cutest thing ever.
So, Heather, you like Zach, huh?
-Dad!
-I do.
What do you like about him?
Well, I think he's funny, he's smart...
...and super hot.
-Dad, the phone....
-Zach, I know! I'm getting it!
-What's up, du?
-Hi.
My son's in the car,
what's going on, dog? You get my VM?
-No, man, I don't check those.
-Oh, cool.
-Hey, Mr. Lawless. I love your commercial.
-Who's that?
Okay. Just hang on one sec, Oliver.
-Out of the car. Both of you.
-What? Why?
I'm gonna finish the call,
then you can get back in. Go, go, go.
All right. You put the child lock on.
-Goddang it!
-Thank you.
And then close the door behind you.
Close the door.
-Sorry about that. Where were we?
-I have no idea.
I know. The reunion. What do you think?
Should we bail?
-Bail? Why? No, man, I'm down.
-Yeah. I could be down.
My head keeps on going back to
when we were out in L.A...
...partying and saying
how fucking stupid it was, right?
You even said there was no way
you would go, you remember saying that?
Yeah, but then you sold me on it.
I mean, Holly James...
...it'd be fun to crash with
you and Stacey.
Yeah. It's just....
Do we have the room? The baby....
No worries, I'll stay at Craig's.
-Oh, you guys talked?
-Yeah, he said he's got plenty of room.
You know what? I'm sure we can
make it happen. Have you stay with us.
Unless that's weird....
-No, why would that be weird?
-Yeah, no, it's not.
-All right, man, either way.
-Yeah, just the way we just said.
Hello?
Okay. Okay. All right.
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go! Come on, guys!
There he is. You see my sign?
Like I'm your driver.
-Where are we? Which way?
-This way.
All right. I'll just put it over here
if anyone needs it.
-You care if I smoke?
-Not at all. God, no.
Please. Go on ahead. Mind if I bum one?
I mean, unless you're low.
Thank you kindly.
Make yourself comfortable. Yeah.
All right.
Hey, real quick,
just to clear up any....
What happened in L.A....
If we could just keep that....
-Oh, yeah. Of course.
-Cool. I don't even know what....
Dan. It's in the past.
-Let's have a fun weekend.
-Yeah.
Yeah. Absolutely.
-Rolling to the Dairy Queen.
-Where else were we gonna hang out?
I don't know how you did it,
but you bagged yourself a good one.
-I used to have a huge crush on her.
-What? No, you didn't.
-Oh, come on. You knew.
-No, I....
I would stare at you every day
in that class that we had.
With the freak teacher?
Wore his fucking pants up to here.
-Oh, yeah.
-What was his name?
-Milman? Milton.
-Mill.... Something.
Jesus.
-Dad, can I ask you something?
-Yeah, in a bit, Zach.
-Milberg?
-Mil.... horn!
-Milman.
-Milhorn!
Yeah. That's right. Milhorn.
The memories, huh?
With the pants. Milhorn.
Were you in that class?
We had that other class together,
remember? Too? Which one was that?
-I don't know, man.
-Drama.
That's what it was.
And that teacher was a character.
-Was she?
-What was her name?
-Spicer!
-Yes. Spicer. Thank you.
-That's amazing.
-She remembers all the things.
Okay. I have to ask you something.
-Jenny Lemor.
-Oh, God!
-She said you hooked up. Is that true?
-I'll tell you what happened with Jenny.
She's always passing me these notes,
do I want a private show?
It's Heather. She's maybe too fast.
-She follows me into the locker room.
-Oh, shit.
-She told me about the locker room.
-She goes into the shower....
She wants to have sex,
wants it to be a threesome. What do I do?
Zach, I don't know!
-What's the matter?
-Zach's just.... It's fine.
-What's the rest of the...?
-Zach?
-Is he upset?
-I don't know.
Is he all right?
-I'll go check on him.
-No, honey, Oliver's mid-story.
-Zach?
-I can tell the story anytime. No big deal.
Zach? Honey? You crying?
Zach is really upset.
You should talk to him. It's girl stuff...
-...he doesn't wanna talk to me about it.
-Okay, I will.
So, what was up
with the whole Spicer thing?
-What?
-You came in with the name right away.
-What are you talking about?
-You tried to think of Milhorn's name...
...going back and forth, but then when
we were trying to do the drama teacher...
...you just came out and said it.
You killed the whole thing.
Killed what whole thing?
I knew her name.
I knew Milhorn's, but I still let you
have fun with it!
-What is going on with you exactly?
-What?
-You're acting so weird.
-How am I acting weird?
Dan, Wi-Fi password?
-It's easier if I do it for him.
-Yeah, go.
There's lots of numbers and letters.
Case sensitive. Be right back.
Hey, man.
-What's up? I'm just....
-Just got off the phone with your boss.
-What? He called you?
-Yeah, man. He called--
-Dude!
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.
So, how did he get your number?
He had it from when
I left that message.
He learned how to check his calls. Fuck,
he's getting smarter! What'd he say?
Wanted to know where we were.
Should he send paperwork.
-Shit!
-It's out of control. Now he's calling me.
You gotta put this to bed today.
Today? I was gonna hang with you.
I called in sick.
-No, man. You handle this. It's uncool.
-Wait, Oliver....
-Are you mad at me?
-What? No, I'm not mad at you.
I just can't have him calling me.
It was fun in L.A., now it's weird.
It is weird. Totally.
-Fix it, dude.
-Got it. I-- I-- I'm on it. Consider it done.
--to put him to sleep, that's the problem.
Why don't you guys...?
Dan!
So we move our mouse
to the search bar....
-This is the mouse?
-That's the mouse.
We click and the cursor will appear.
-So we just type "Bill."
-Lowercase?
It doesn't matter.
Into the search bar here....
My screen looks different.
Sorry to interrupt. Bill, can I steal you
for one second? It's important.
Yeah. Can you just give me
5 minutes, please?
-Yeah. I'll be right outside the door.
-I think I hit....
Would you help him, please?
-Enter. Return.
-And click "search."
Hey. You all right?
What's with the pink?
This is my sister's room.
My Dad made me move in
since you were coming.
That sucks. I could have stayed
at Craig's.
You should have told him fuck off.
-Oh, I would never--
-Well, sometimes you got to, man.
Everybody's got their line in the sand,
you know?
Right.
All right. What else you got?
Well, my girlfriend, Heather...
...she wants to have a threesome.
-Guy or a girl.
-Girl.
Okay.
-So, what's the problem?
-I'm nervous.
About what?
I think she thinks
I'm more experienced than I am.
How many girls have you fucked?
None.
Why?
Well, I'm 14.
What did your dad say?
-You talked to him about it?
-I've tried.
-I feel like he's weird about sex stuff.
-Yeah.
He thinks you should only have sex
with someone if you love them.
You know what I think?
I think you should find a way
of loving both these girls.
Simultaneously.
What's up?
I'm in the middle of my Internet class.
Did you call--?
Wait, what Internet class?
I gotta learn how to use
these machines.
Steve just taught us how to search
on Google.
I'm not even sure that's the best way
to search for stuff.
Google is a dated thing...
...it all depends on what web browser
you're using.
And if the search engine
is compatible....
-Hold on. Didn't you call in sick?
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Did you call Drazen?
-I cannot afford to get sick.
You're not gonna get sick.
Did you call Drazen?
I called him, just to check in.
-What's wrong? I was just checking in.
-Okay.
I really wish you would run that
by me first.
-It turns out, he did not love that call.
-Why?
Because he's been with me
exclusively.
He's been communicating with me.
We got a rapport and now...
...he seems really rattled.
Damn it, Bill.
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.
It's just, I feel bad
you spent all this money.
Can you fix it, please? Please?
I don't know, I'll try. I doubt it.
He is genuinely pissed.
But I'll try.
I thank you, and again...
...I am sorry, I just blew it.
-But no more calls.
-You know what?
-I'm not calling anyone.
-Okay.
Ever.
Goddamn it.
Sorry, guys.
So you're kissing Heather, right?
Focus on her.
She's number one,
don't let her forget that.
You don't want the other girl--
What's her name?
-Jill.
-You don't want Jill to feel left out.
-Of course.
-All right.
So you're gonna do
one of these guys--
-Okay. That makes sense.
-Okay?
Things are heating up,
clothes are coming off, we're fucking.
Obviously, you got one cock
so you can't do both at the same time.
-Right.
-Try and get as close as possible.
-How?
-You stack them.
Yeah, like lawn chairs,
one on top of the other.
-Like lawn chairs?
-Think about it. Visualize it.
It works.
Okay.
Oh, hey.
Don't forget. Wear a condom.
-Right.
-But then rip that thing off.
-Hose down those lawn chairs.
-Sure.
It's Lawless.
Yo, yo, yo. What's up, dog?
It's the D man.
Just wanted you to know
the Bill-sitch, handled, dog.
You won't receive another call
from him.
Of that I can assure you, sir.
Heading out of the office now.
Guess I'll see you back at the crib.
And we gotta figure out
what we're gonna get into tonight.
You and me, player.
Okay.
Cool. Late.
So, what did he say exactly?
He didn't. They were just going out.
-They?
-Yeah.
Craig and Randy came by.
They all had a drink together
and then they left.
I said that you would text him.
I've been texting, Stace.
I've been texting.
It's Lawless.
Hey.
It's getting late.
I guess you're still out.
Not getting texts.
If you could let me know
when are you gonna...
...or whatever.
I can just leave a key under the mat.
The one right at the front door.
I'll leave it under there.
All right.
Hope you're having fun.
Good night, Oliver.
This was awesome. All right.
-Good night, Craig.
-Later.
-Later.
-Later.
I don't know what you're doing.
Relax, let this guy do it, right.
Take this off.
Oh, shit. Are we being too loud?
-A little.
-Okay.
Sorry. I'll try to keep it down.
Actually....
-Hi.
-Hi.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Right now?
Yeah, man.
What's up?
So?
Is everything okay between us?
What do you mean?
I don't know. I'm just feeling
a little bit of a distance.
Has something changed
that I'm not aware of?
Maybe we should talk about it.
We haven't really talked
about what happened.
I'm kind of in the middle of something,
you know?
All right. Sit down.
Oh, fuck me.
Dan, L.A. was fun.
We did it up.
-But it was a onetime thing.
-I know, totally.
I don't want that to happen again.
I need you to know that.
-I'm not gay.
-I'm not either.
Right. I mean, I'm married,
I have a family.
Exactly.
But, but, but....
What if we were in, like, an alternate
universe where I wasn't?
-Why does it matter?
-I don't know.
Dan?
Go to sleep.
Yeah.
Dan.
Jesus. No.
-I'm sleeping. Get off of me.
-Sorry. Sorry.
-It's delish.
-I just put it together, guys.
-Home cooking, man, I miss it.
-Stop.
Good morning.
Look at this kid. He's focused.
You got a big night.
What's going on here?
What's up, buddy? Hey, man.
You remember Alyssa?
-Hi.
-Yeah. All cleaned up.
So, what were we laughing about?
Z-Bone's got himself
a big night lined up.
Z--? Z-Bone. What is that?
Nickname I gave the kid.
I don't think that works at all.
He's going to have his first threesome.
What?
Right?
-I was 16 before I did that.
-Did what?
Nothing.
-Alyssa, would you like some potatoes?
-I'd love some.
Thank you, Stacey.
Hey, man, you're ready to go.
So where's this supposed
to go down?
At Heather's tomorrow night.
-And where are her parents?
-They are going to be at your reunion.
Oh, they are? That's perfect.
-Yeah. It actually is.
-Totally.
So I'm the last to find out about this?
-Stace doesn't know.
-Don't tell her, Dad.
He's not gonna tell her. He's cool.
Yeah, I'm cool,
but I should have known about this.
I tried, but you wouldn't listen.
-So I asked Oliver.
-Oh, so you encouraged this?
-Yeah. Why wouldn't I?
-He's 14.
What are you so upset about?
You should be celebrating. He's a stud.
You know what?
I want you out of here.
-What?
-You heard me.
I want you out of here.
Stacey, this does not concern you.
-It's okay, Stace.
-It's not okay!
It is okay!
Maybe I overstayed my welcome.
I'm gonna get my things and crash
at Craig's.
I am so sorry, Oliver.
Dan, what is the matter with you?
I'm so sorry.
So you can see that the ladies
are on the dance floor...
...underneath this beautiful railing.
If you get a chance later...
...come and check out the model.
It's almost to scale.
If you actually can hold on that
for a second, Lucy.
Thank you so much.
I just got a text from Lawless...
...and he needs the password
to the Facebook page.
What does he need it for?
Oh, Jesus Christ.
He wants to post a photo of us
from last night.
-Who gives a fuck?
-Dan.
Please give him the password.
Oliver is not a committee member,
Lucy.
-But Craig is.
-He's just gonna give it to him, Jerry.
No, I won't give it. I can only give it
to people who are on the committee.
Okay, everyone heard him say that.
You're on record.
Okay. Fine.
R, E...
...U...
...N...
...I...
...O...
-...N.
-It's "reunion"?
With three exclams on the end.
Good password. Randy, come see.
Oh, look. He's doing it.
-We're talking about something else.
-What are you talking about?
Excuse us.
Who's that? That's so....
Okay. You know what?
This has gone off the rails
and what are we doing?
We're giving passwords
to non-committee members...
...we're letting them upload
unauthorized photos--
-Dan, I'm gonna ask you to calm down.
-Lucy. I'm totally calm.
What the fuck is going on here?
This is ridiculous.
It's one guy and we're gonna build
the whole fucking thing around him?
-It was your idea.
-What do you care?
Renina, you never, ever talk
and now you pipe in?
-She's right, Dan. We--
-Okay. So what?
So I made a mistake.
Am I not human?
This reunion is for everybody.
It's for all of us, not just him!
God!
Okay.
Announcement.
I think I'm out, guys.
-All right, man.
-No.
I mean "out" out.
We know what you meant.
-It's fine. I mean, all the work's done.
-Okay.
Anyway.
-What? That?
-Yeah, look. And then....
-Hey, Daniel?
-Hey, Bill.
Are you okay?
A lot of stuff, Bill.
Yeah. Well, I hate to pile on more...
...but we got a problem because I am....
I am 90 percent sure...
...that this is not the guy we met with.
And I do not know what is going on...
...but I think we're being duped
in some way.
And see, when I click this,
like Steve said...
...the picture stays the same.
Now if I could enlarge this,
then we would know who this is...
...but I can't. There's no way
to enlarge this.
Yep. There's no way to enlarge it.
Right?
Fuck.
Maybe if I hit this.
No.
-Bill.
-Yeah?
There is a way to enlarge it.
That's not him.
No, it isn't.
Google is a great way
to search for stuff.
-It's actually the best engine out there.
-What?
And you can add someone
to an e-mail chain at any point.
It's so easy.
Daniel, what's going on?
I lied to you.
There's no deal in L.A.
Kent Drazen isn't real.
The guy you met,
his name is Oliver Lawless...
...and he was the coolest guy
in my high school...
...and I wanted to go out there...
...and convince him to come
to the reunion.
You faked the deal?
So you could take a trip to L.A.?
Why didn't you just buy a ticket
and go on the weekend?
Yeah.
In retrospect,
that would have been easier.
-But I needed an excuse for my wife, so....
-Okay.
I got you. So couldn't you have just
told her it was a business trip...
...and left me out of it?
I could have.
I could have. I could have done that.
Actually, I'm not sure why I didn't.
So, what now?
I mean, I assume I'm fired.
Fired from what?
I don't even know
if we have a company anymore.
Right.
I spent so much money.
I know. Right.
Right.
I don't know what to say, Bill.
I mean, I am so sorry.
I never meant for it to go this far.
You know what's funny?
I actually liked Drazen.
I did too.
It just felt good, you know,
chasing the big fish again, you know?
He liked you, Bill.
That was real.
That wasn't real.
Well, right, I mean
he wasn't really Drazen but....
Did you get him?
-Who?
-Your friend Lawless.
I got him.
Good.
Bill, are we cool?
Have fun at the reunion, Daniel.
Ready?
Yep.
Dan. This is gorgeous.
Stacey Polster.
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.
Wendy Fleur.
-How are you?
-I'm good.
It's actually Stacey Landsman now.
You remember Dan?
Hi, Wendy.
Hi.
We had Spanish and Chemistry.
-I'm gonna go get some drinks.
-Thanks.
-Just a white wine.
-Yeah. Two.
Yeah. Lawless' crew.
Hey.
-Dan?
-Dale Harkin.
What's up, buddy?
Gonna see you
next week, right?
I hear big things
are happening over there.
Shurmur tried to FaceTime me
the other day.
I didn't know he had a phone.
Yeah.
Hey, did I...
...did I hear right?
You got Lawless here?
-I might have had something to do with it.
-Nice job, dude.
Oh, man.
Hey, not to sound gay or anything...
...I always thought
he was just the shit.
Like I would have done anything
to have been his friend, you know?
Yeah.
-Anyway, let's get fucked up, right?
-Yeah.
Hey, Dan.
Hey, fucking A, guys. You did it.
How you doing?
I'm fucking great.
How you doing?
Smoking?
Yeah, I smoke. When I drink
sometimes I like to smoke.
What's the big deal?
-Are you okay?
-I'm fucking great.
It's a party. I'm partying.
Just loosen the fuck up.
Who are you right now?
You're wasted.
You're obsessed with Oliver.
Wearing the same underwear as him.
How do you know
what kind of underwear he wears?
-You fucking him?
-What?
I did his laundry, Dan.
-Dan?
-Jerry!
-Is that cocaine?
-Come here.
Okay.
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
Let me ask you something.
-How about this? D Nice?
-What?
Have people just call me that
from now on?
I don't know. It feels forced.
It's a bit forced.
That's what I was thinking too.
Okay. Give me some options.
Pitch me up some new ones.
You have to find what works for you.
Like me, it's J Dog, it's obvious.
Fuck.
You've got it all figured out, don't you?
Don't you?
I don't know. I don't think....
You have such an easy life, J Dog.
Let's go back to the party, okay?
Yeah. Let's get back in.
J Dog wants back in.
Why wouldn't he?
Holly James. Lovebirds back together.
-Who is he?
-You all right, Dan?
You're not gonna say hi?
You're here because of me, and you won't
say hi? That's pretty fucking rude.
Why don't you go sit down, buddy?
How's Craig's house?
Bye, Dan.
You gonna fuck that pussy?
That tight puss?
He said you have one.
Probably not anymore, though, right?
-Probably gotten a little loose.
-Let's go.
-What are you doing?
-Excuse us.
What are you doing?
We gonna do a little talk over there?
Don't squeeze so hard.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What's happening?
I mean, we've--
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-Can we start over? Let's just start over.
-Start what over?
Hey. I'm Dan Landsman.
We went to high school
and never had sex with each other.
Dan, go home.
What? No, no, no. Come on. Wait.
-Why can't we just talk?
-There's nothing to talk about, Dan.
Oh, really? Because I think
there is stuff to talk about.
Why won't you talk to me?
Talk to me, Oliver.
Okay. What do you wanna
talk about, Dan?
-You know what I wanna talk about.
-And what do you wanna hear?
You wanna hear that I wanna be
with you?
-Why did the music stop?
-Would that do it for you, Dan?
That I can't stop
thinking about when we fucked?
Don't-- No-- Outside.
That I'm rock hard right now
just thinking about it? How's that?
Oh, Dan, I can't wait to get
my dick back in your mouth.
I'm so dying to make you cum
since you didn't last time.
Maybe that's what you're looking for.
No, no, no. Let's fucking talk, man.
You wanted to do this, let's talk.
Let's get some closure.
How do we end this?
How is this?
It meant nothing to me.
You weren't even a blip
on my fucking radar.
Goddamn it, Dan.
Jesus Christ, that's a first.
Dan.
-I need you to take Zach to school.
-I'm on it.
I'll just....
So, how was your three way?
Didn't happen.
Damn, it was a prank.
No, Dad, it just wasn't me.
Look, I know
I've been a little absent lately.
You've tried to talk to me
about this stuff.
I just want you to know
you can talk to me about whatever.
And I wanna talk to you
about some things.
Like how you had sex with Oliver?
You heard.
-How did it even...?
-I don't know, buddy.
We were out in Los Angeles,
one thing led to another....
I mean, you know,
these things happen.
-They do?
-Yeah, you'll see when you're older.
A lot of different factors come into play,
I mean...
...a lot of it had to do with....
Dad, are you, you okay?
It's okay. It'll be okay.
I fucked up.
I really fucked up.
Mom hates me.
I don't think she hates you. I think....
-She does.
-Maybe she's just weirded out?
-Are you?
-I mean, yeah. It's messed up.
-Well, what do I do?
-I don't know.
-Figure it out with Mom?
-Will you come with me?
I have school.
I'm gonna get a lot of shit today,
and I just have to deal with it. So do you.
Hey, babe.
-Hey, Mr. Landsman.
-Hey, Heather.
-Heard about last night.
-Oh, you did? Great.
It's pretty epic.
It's all over Facebook.
It is?
Yeah. You're fucked up, dude. I like it.
Yeah. Thanks.
Yeah....
It was awesome having you here.
What a great weekend.
It was weird all that shit you blasted
Dan with in front of everybody, but...
...classic Lawless.
Thanks for the material.
Gonna last us for years.
For years. Yeah.
-Guys.
-All right, buddy.
I could have fucked either one of you.
At any point.
But I didn't.
Why is that?
All right, fellas.
So there were buttons on that shirt
when I bought it?
And I yelled at that manager.
For no reason.
Yeah.
How did the buttons
come off the shirt, Dan?
He ripped them off.
Yeah.
Stace, I'm not....
So, what was it, Dan?
Please explain it to me.
I wish I could. I don't, I don't....
If you had asked me two weeks ago,
what the odds of this happening....
-I would--
-Oh, my God, stop.
I'm just trying to talk about it.
I mean, to deal with it, you know,
because we have to.
Right?
Fuck.
Is this a bad time?
-What are you doing here?
-Bro, I was heading out, and....
I don't know,
I feel like I needed to apologize.
-I said some things--
-Yeah, we heard them.
Look, Stace, you gotta know...
...I did this. Not Dan.
It was all me.
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?
-Well, can I at least come in?
-I'll come out.
Dude, listen to me.
Last night, ripping you to shreds
like that, it was....
Must have been embarrassing for you.
-I'm sorry.
-Well, thanks for saying that.
In L.A...
...I treated you
like a piece of meat, man.
-It wasn't right.
-Yeah. Thanks for that, as well.
I don't wanna be doing that.
I don't wanna be that guy.
Yeah, I don't wanna be the guy I was
in that scenario.
You just put me up on this pedestal,
you know? It was like....
That's a lot of pressure to deal with.
It made me feel like
I needed to play the part.
-Didn't wanna let you down.
-Play the part?
Dan...
...you gotta open your eyes, man.
I'm a mess.
That Banana Boat spot? It's pathetic.
That's a national spot.
You saw my apartment, man.
I'm broke as shit.
I don't know fucking Dermot Mulroney.
-But I saw you guys.
-He's a super down to earth dude.
He's fucking normal as hell,
but he didn't have a clue who I was.
Because we'd never met.
I'm nothing, man.
I peaked in the 11th grade.
Hang on one second.
-Hey, mac.
-Relax, man.
I am relaxed. Wanna miss your flight?
I don't give a fuck. It's on you.
Your call. Yeah.
What's that?
It's yours. I borrowed it.
After you fucked me.
You probably don't remember.
I was just a blip on your radar, but....
Keep it.
You weren't just a blip, Dan.
Even if I was.
Take care of yourself, pal.
Dear Grant Barklidge, Class of '94.
Fun times last night.
Although, I do apologize
for my personal life taking center stage.
That was unexpected.
Had a great DJ who, if you ask me,
got unfairly overshadowed.
Sorry about that, Tyler.
But it's funny.
I brought it all on myself.
I thought if I could deliver
Oliver Lawless, I'd be a hero...
...single-handedly saving our reunion.
But we didn't need him, did we?
We didn't need the most popular guy
from high school.
We didn't need the face
of a national Banana Boat campaign.
We needed a symbol
of something more.
And I for one was ready to risk
everything I had for the chance to find it.
But it took all this
to make me realize...
...Oliver Lawless was inside me
all along.
There's a Lawless inside all of us.
Sometimes you just gotta give him
a little nudge, wake him up.
After I post this update
and leave you all time to read it...
...I will be deactivating
this Facebook account.
For I am the only one in possession
of the new password.
But I shall leave you with this:
"Be grateful for what you have,
and you'll end up having more."
"If you concentrate
on what you don't have...
...you will never, ever have enough."
That's Oprah Winfrey for you,
right there.
Telling it like it is.
Goodbye, old friends.
I'll see you all on the other side.
And I will forever be...
...your Chairman
of the Alumni Committee...
...Daniel Gregory Landsman.
A.k.a...
...The D Train.
