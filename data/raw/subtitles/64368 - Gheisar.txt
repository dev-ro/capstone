<I>Gheisar</I>
Oh... What a disaster!
My daughter!
Brother
What should I say to her brothers?!
Oh my Lord!
Brother!
Brother!
If I loss my dear daughter...
What should I say to my sons?!
What should I say to Farmaan?
She is his only sister
and he even dies for her.
Oh my Lord! what should I say to Gheisar!?
- Have you told anything to Farmaan?
- Yes
What's wrong Ma'am?
Is she your daughter?
Yes
 Did she take somthing?
Yes, She took poison...
Too much poison
Maybe she is in love!
Maybe her cousin, friend or ...
It makes no sense!
She suddenly passed out ...
What a disaster!
Oh my God! Farmaan is here!
- What's happened?
- Oh son!
Dont't cry mother!
Calm down mother!
Just happens what is ordained by our Lord!
What's happened?
What's happened? Come on!
I'm her brother! I said what's happened?
She's taken poison Farmaan Khan!
[Khan: Old fashioned word to respect a man]
We didn't notice.
She just passed out next to the pool.
She got white pale!
Oh my Lord! Help her safe!
Oh ... what if she dies!
Is that man her brother?
Yes... Her older brother.
God may bless him with patience.
Is he a butcher?
Yes dear! He is the famous Farmaan!
 Prays
- So... He is the famous Farmaan!
-Yes
We are from same neighbourhood.
I'm from Haaj Mehdi's alley.
People say he was so bully.
No one could stand against him.
Then he became a good man and went to Mecca.
[In Islam, before you go to Mecca you
should repent and ask for forgivness.]
Sorry ...Are you the father?
- No, I'm her uncle. How is she?
- What's up? 
- How is she?
Honestly...
It was too late.
She took too much
We couldn't do anything. So sorry
Oh my lord!
Oh my lord!
Farmaan!
Uncle...
You took mother home...
And I'll go close the shop and back home.
We found this paper with her.
Take it.
It's better you keep it.
It's somehow private.
What should I do if Gheisar cames back...
... from journey and finds out the truth?!
I don't know... I don't know
God!
Oh God!
- Where is Fati?
- She couldn't make it.
[Fati is nickname for Fateme]
My dear Fati!
Fati!
Who is this girl? ... she is so upsetl.
Her name is A'azam.
She is Fati's younger brother's fiancee.
pomegranate ... pomegranate
Brother... May I have some words with you?
What's up sister?
Sit down brother.
I need to show you something.
Please read this for me.
Please keep it private.
It belongs to Fati.
She might have written something in it.
She must have written why ...
...why she did so!
To my dearest ones ...
...My mother...
... My brothers, Farmaan and Gheisar...
... And my uncle.
Now that I'm not with you ...
Read it brother.
I'll read it and  ...
I'll explain it for you later.
So good she passed away.
Unless ...
What should she say to Gheisar and Farmaan.
Farmaan is more sensible ...
... But what about Gheisar!
Oh brother... tell me what's happened?
Sister ... It is too bad!
Don't ask me to tell you!
Now... it's late.
It's happened what shouldn't happen!
But I'm her mother...
... Tell me... What has happened?
What can I say?
What can I say?
God may bless us with patience.
She used to go to Badri's home to study...
[Badri is nickname for Badrie]
... One day Mansour ...
... Badri's older brother...
... Makes an excuse to see her (Fati)...
And you yourself know what happens then.
Oh My God!
What a shame!
Oh God!
He always said to the poor girl...
... "I want to marry you".
... But she was pregnant ...
and there left no way to her.
... So that poor girl was raped.
I heard the last part uncle ... Who?
I said Who?
Say it uncle!
Why Don't you say nothing uncle?
Mansour AghMangul!
That coward rapscallion!
- I'll kill him.
- No Farmaan.
You have promised.
You've sweared on The Holy Prophet.
You have repented.
- Let go of me!
- Calm down and ask God for peace.
I can not stay calm.
Let go of me.
It's about our dignity.
If I don't revenge, Gheisar will cover ...
the whole bazzar's floor with their blood.
But before him ... I will do so.
I swear to God, I'll kill them.
Let go of me.
First you may kill me, then you can go!
It is a contempt to a champion ...
Don't you think I used to be ...
as weak as I am now...
... I used to be a champion one day.
I could wrestle for 2 consecutive days
But with all of that strength...
I never used a knife.
Cowards should be afraid of your strength
...not your knife.
A small kid also can use a knife.
I could even break a wall!
But now...
I've developed Cataract.
My feet are not strong anymore.
Do you think I'm ok with it?
I feel sad in my heart.
My heart is in pain for Fati.
But ... What can I do?
Death is better than this situation.
But you've taken a vow.
Give me the knife and ask God for peace
I don't want to be a looser.
I'll go unarmed.
You Coward!
You are less than a pig!
My sister killed herself.
All people know that.
Let your brothers know!
Mansour, your brother killed my sister.
That's bullshit.
This dirty pig first rapped that poor girl
... and then disclaimed it.
Let you brothers know how coward you are!
you coward villian.
- Stop
- Why are you stopping me?
Don't you know your coward brother?!
Your brother made my heart suffer.
You coward pig.
I won't stop till I kill you.
Let go of me... Let go of me ...
Let go of me... I'll kill you!
Get away from me... I'll kill you.
You have no escape.
I'll kill you... You coward pig.
 I'll kill you.
Karim!
Gheisar! Where are you?!
These people killed your brother.
His name was bigger than himself!
It's all fake.
Nowaday anyone brags about himself.
No one can oppose us.
His younger brother is more crazy.
Come one. Bazzar is crowded.
We should take him to the roof.
- Coming from Abadan?
- Ahuh
 [Abadan is the name of a
South-Western city of Iran]
Do you know anybody around here?
Tehran is getting big and big.
Going to the Bazzar?
Yes, to the bazzar.
God is great... God is great...
[Saying prayers]
It's Gheisar. He's coming.
Mother!
Uncle!
Fati!
Fati!
Fati come and take you souvenirs...
... Wanna go to the shop to see Farmaan.
- Hello
- Welcome back Gheisar!
Missed you so much dear.
What's wrong?
Fati ...
... Come ...
I've bought you the dress you wanted.
... The same color you said you like.
... And here's a coat for Farmaan.
Huh... Found it!
... Here's an agate ring for my dear uncle.
Oh dear Fati! Where are you ...
... To see Gheisar has bought you a dress.
Oh... Where are you Farmaan.
Why did you left your 
brother Gheisar alone?
Come on my dears...
Gheisar has brought you souvenirs.
Oh my God!
- Farmaan! Where is my knife?
I want to go to my Brother.
- Gheisar!
- Mother!
- I'm here A'azam!
- Hello
- Hello
Come here my dear... Come and sit.
Let me give you a fresh tea.
Sister, bring some fruit for A'azam.
Thanks mother...
But no, I'm not in the mood for fruit now.
I eat nothing now.
I went to the holey shrine,
... talked to my Lord.
life is so cruel.
Last night I was dreaming about Farmaan.
He was in a big garden with ladies in wait.
I'm sure he is in peace...
...His soul is in rest.
So my dear... When do you go back ...
to Abadan to your work?...
... You wanted to buy a car.
I have no work to do but one...
...I mean three works...
To send them to the other world one by one.
... To rest in peace with ladies in wait.
Don't be so naive!
You seem you've chosen the right way.
You found a good job.
You mind your business.
The Government will find and punish them.
The Government will find them. Ok.
They will punish them. Ok.
But you know what mother?!
No... You Don't know!
Stop it please!
No need to think about me.
If you kill them, they'll kill you.
At least think about your poor mother.
No one need to know ...
why Fati killed herself.
Even police officers!
In short, no body should know.
A'azam, you keep your mouth shut too.
Ok Gheisar.
By the way A'azam, I'll go to your
home this evening. We need to talk.
Off course.
Goodbye mother
Bye.
My Lord... keep him safe.

Greeting
Here Gheisar khan, come and sit.
Let's drink  a cup of tea.
Buzzing
Greeting
How are you?
What's up?
-Tea ... Tea
- Hey, trun off the radio.
- How are you Ahmad?
- Sad ... for your brother.
Everything will pass.
No one could recognize them.
No one in this city who could say you, your
brother and uncle've ever bothered them.
All of you are so kind.
But ... There is someone...
... That Gheisar have forgotten him...
... and he was so upset of you
Tell me Reza... Who?
Don't panic ... That is "Nane' Mashhadi"
She said you have promised to take
her to a journey to Mashhad.
[Mashhad: North-Eastern city of Iran where the holey shrine of Imam Reza located in.]
She said you made a promise to her.
...And who could ever doubt your promise?!
Yes I made the promies ...
and I'll take her anyway.
Why is your face like this?
Who has beaten you?
That's a long story.
- Where?
- Me, Haii Nosrat, Reza 500, Ali Forsat and
... many others ... With Karim.
- Karim! Which Karim?
- Karim AghMangul.
All together...
They said: Let's go take some shots,
... but I said no.
I swear I never thought about it.
[Islam:Drinking intoxicant is illegitimate]
Talking and walking, arrived Hotel Cuba in
 Darband. [ A small village near Tehran]
Friends sat and started ...
to take beer and wine.
We took first shot to our friendship...
... Took second shot to our gathering ...
Sheikh Ali gave third shot and said cheers!
[Sheikh: A word for respect a man]
...And we took.
He said: To Mehdi. We
took and I got so drunk.
I was searching my pockets to pay money
that I noticed no one is watching me.
I got out of Hotel and suddenly ...
... I saw a very big man.He beat me
and throw me into the street.
I said What's wrong? but he beat me again.
I said: So cruel! ... And he beat me hard.
I was just about to pay him the money
And after that I wake up in the hospital.
I told everyone it was a fair fight and
I beat him too; please you tell it was so.
You know, Kind of shameful.
What happened to Karim?
He's been very moody last week.
He invited me to eat Kalle-Paache to amend.
[Kalle-Paache: Iranian food]
He said He's going to go Qom and somewhere.
[Qom: Central city in Iran with holey shrine]
... He said he is going to take a trip.
He'll move this afternoon...
And He is in the public bath.
The therm next to the bazzar?
Yes, he said he'll take a bath
and then he takes the trip.
Buzzing
- Hello Gheisar Khan.
- Hello
People talking
Sir Hossein, please give us some tea.
Bless you Gheisar.
- Thank you.
- God bless you.
It's the second murder
in this neighbourhood.
- I feel a connection between them.
- That's right sir.
This neighbourhood has been
so calm for some times.
And it will be so.
There is no place for
these rebelions anymore.
Stay back kid.
Stay back.
Every body... Don't stop here...
Please go... Please go
A man singing a song
Hello
What's up? Why don't you talk?
[Man is reading Shahname,
The great work of Iranian poet, Ferdousi]
Have you heard Karim AghMangul
has got killed in the therm?
So ... yes.
Did you kill him?
Yes.
So you are a murderer too.
Not this one, but there will be two others.
Then it's my fate ...
... That all of my children...
... Ruin their lifes themeselves,
one by one?!
Don't you think that you may make your
father's soul suffer ?
At least think of your old mother...
My only hope is to wait for you...
to hear your footsteps.
I want to see you in wedding suit!
- What about A'azam? God is whatching you!
- Oh... Come on!
It's our fate so!
She has to find a new fiance!
It's not fair!
With all respects uncle,
but stop talking about being fair!
Show me just one fair man
and I'll become the next one!
This world has always been unfair to me.
I acted toward people out of mercy
but they show me unmercy.
Faramn who was a bully one day... And
when he was so pissed off, He got drunk.
And when he started to shout ...
... Even walls was 
trembling and all cowards
...  were seeking a hole to hide like
a rat , But what now?
He took the journey [to Mecca]
and he quit everything.
He started to live a nobel life
and became a honorable man
... But what did they do?
... So it's life ...
This is the real world uncle!
Kill or get killed!
Now ... Where is Farmaan?
Where is Fati
who always was kind, even to animals!
All her life was loving us ...
And all hobby she had,
was listening to that radio.
God may bless their souls.
I remember Ramadhan nights, me and Farmaan
[Ramadhan is the month fast when Muslims .]
We used to spend all money he made
to buy food for poor people; And now what?
That three vilians ...
That three cowards killed them.
I'll do the same.
I'll send them to their graves!
It was just the begining!
In the therm,
he was on his knees, begging me
His eyes was wide open uncle ...
Do you undrestand uncle?
He was begging me with his eyes.
I'll make the two others beg me.
I'll kill them one by one.
No offence but ... you are so old.
... And I just have to things two do.
First, I've promised Nane' Mashhadi
to take her to Mashhad ...
And second... Make A'azam forget me.
Just this!
You think what will happen uncle?
Do you think anyone even
care about me being dead mother?
After three days,
all people will forget ...
... who was I and Why I died.
Just as we forgot!
Nowaday no one will listen to the stories.
Who's there?
Open it. It's me... Gheisar.
- Hello. Here you came!
- Hello. Is your brother home?
He'll be back soon. How are you?
Getting a little forgetful.
Did Something happen? What's wrong?
No, It's ok.
Let's go to the reception room.
Talking so formally!
Let's go to the living room.
Ok, let's go.
Let me make a tea ... Oh Gheisar Khan...
Why are you standing there?
Here, come in. Come and sit.
Oh ... It's ok here.
I'm coming from our home. You know
mother always has fresh tea prepared.
Sooner or later my brother
will come home and
... asks for fresh tea.
I'll make it anyway.
We need to talk.
Hope it's a good thing.
I wish it was!
I'm in a trouble.
Oh ... What's the problem?
We are a family now.
We are engaged. Tell me what's wrong?
I'll tell you later.
Tea will be ready in a minute.
A few days ago I, your mother
and uncle went to the graveyard.
We thought you may
come there around evening.
No, I had something more important to do.
What was that?
Listen A'azam...
You are a good girl. I wanna say something
but I don't mean you did something wrong.
I don't deserve to have a
good family and life anymore.
I'll do every thing for you but you know..
It's too bad for a girl to engage...
... and then cancel it.
[Old Iranian custom]
... Specially if the groom cancels it.
It destroys her reputation.
But I swear it dosen't matter to me!
I will marry no one except Gheisar.
Either you or no one else!
Abbas [her brother] will feel so bad.
At least can't you say what's wrong?!
Yes, I'm so ashamed of Abbas.
But I got into something out of stupidity
that I never though of.
- You ... You ...
- You what?
Nothing. I just thought of
something stupid.
What stupid thought?
People said somebody has been killed
in the therm next to the bazzar.
So ... What does it have to me?
Nothing...
you just said you are in throuble.
- Let me check on samovar. I'll be back.
- Wait a moment... Wait a moment.
I...
I can not marry you.
Because I'm not in control
of  my life anymore.
... like an ill person.
I'm not sure of my future.
You are backing off!
I've never been coward.
And don't you dare to say so!
You are beautiful, nice and decent.
You are much better that stupid
street girls. And beside all these...
We have grown up together.
I never cheat on my enemy, let alone you!
I really love you A'azam.
That's Abbas.
Abbas, Gheisar is here!
Oh ... What a good news.
Oh hello to you nice gentelman.
Long time no see.
Hello to you... Sorry my foot is tingling.
- A'azam did you make tea?
- Yes, it's ready.
- Here, sit.
Thanks. You are always so gentle.
These days you hardly can
find a real gentelman.
Do you know why?
Because they all are compared to you...
So... they are nothing.
Sister, set the table.
By the way, Have you heard
 about Karim AghMangul?
- Yes, I heard something.
- I don't know what we should do tomorrow!
What does it have to you?
We were supposed to go to Abadan
tomorrow to buy some goods;
...Then I take goods to Tehran and
he goes to Kuwiat for a month..
Who is "He"?
Rahim AghMangul...
... Brother of Karim who deceased today.
Oh... Come on Abbas.
Where do you supposed to visit him?
Tomorrow he has something to do in
slaughterhouse and I should be there at 9.
He is going to get some money
and then we will go together.
Nane, make yourself prepared to go
to Mashhad as soon as possible.
Hello Gheisar Khan. Is thet right?
Are you going to take me to Mashhad?
I'll be ready soon. I have no one
to say goodbye...
- God may bless you.
- I owe you my life.
And besides, I've promised you.
And honestly,
I need to visit the holey shrine too.
God may bless you.
Hello uncle.
Hello Gheisar.
Your mother went to bazzar
to visit you. Didn't you see her?
- Why?
 - We recieveda letter asking you
to go back to Abadan to your work.
I won't go back there.
For what reason you won't go?
Huh?
Because I have something
more important to do.
That was Mansour?
No, It was Rahim.
You are young and naive.
With these stupid actions,
you made a big trouble for yourself.
But you like this trouble
deep in your heart.
Tell me uncle! The person who people talk
about him and say he was so smart...
An old champion whom
all people believed in ...
No uncle, You disappoint me.
If people are supposed
to get timid by aging,...
Then never let me get old!
(let me die before getting old and timid)
Shut up. What do you know?
The more you get old,
the more you feel yourself close to God.
You are young and naive.
You feel good when
you kill them but I don't.
You ... You are just a kid.
Yes ... I'm truely a kid...
... And anyone who hurts me,
I'll hurt him back.
But you... If anyone hurts you,
you just brag about your chapionships.
... And a champion should be modest.
.. And if any one hurts him...
He just says nothing and let it go!
Do tou call it "being a champion"?
Farmaan never disobeyed me but you do.
So, that's me.
I had nothing to do with them. I was
busy with my work to make a good life.
That cowards made me act like this.
Your mother has recently
changed her path to the bazzar.
Do you know why?
She went the same old path one day...
... And she arrived to Farmaan's old shop.
She felt a piercing feeling
in her heart and she passed out.
She didn't want you to know.
I told her to go to holey shrine to pray.
It make her feel better.
Son, I feel flames of misfortune
around our life.
Don't make it worse.
At least think about your old mother.
Here... Give this to mother.
Tell her to smell it.
It makes her feel better.
[His shirt smells blood and he says blood
and revenge will make her feel better]
Tell her...
Tell her Gheisar will get you another one.
I'm going to Mashhad.
I know my greatest sin is loving A'azam.
That pure and nice girl...
... Who has remained pure and kind...
... In this ugly and nasty world.
You know that I intended to marry her.
... But in this situation that I
don't know even what will happen to me ...
... How can I expect her to wait for me.
....Besides, We may never marry.
My lord, bless her with happiness.
It's too late for me as well as
my mother and uncle.
... But this poor girl, A'azam...
... She is too young and
she should be blest.
Nane'!
Do you stay at our home tonight or
you want me to take you to your home?
Oh son, I want to go to my home.
Since now till the time I die,
I will pray for you to be blessed.
Oh my God! That's probably Gheisar!
- Oh my lord, please help him.
- please you say nothing. I'll tell him.
- Who's there?
- It's me, Gheisar.
- Hello. Is your brother home?
- Yes. God bless you. Come in.
I went home. The door was locked.
I just felt bad...
I thought maybe they've
 gone to uncle's home.
- Uncle Mehdi is here.
- Is something wrong?
- No.
- Hello.
- Hello Gheisar.
- God bless you.
 - Hope your next tripe be to Mecca.
[Good blessing to go to
anther holey places to visit]
My mother died?
That's why the door was locked!
Mother! You were the third one.
You left me alone too.
Miserables are always unblessed.
You are young and you can stand it.
It is too hard for uncle who 's lost 
all his family in the last month!
(Means he is older and it is hard for him)
Where did you bury her?
You came just in time.
God may bless your soul sister.
She passed away today.
We did the ritual till evening.
[Isalmic ritual to wash body with some 
herbs and water before burying it]
You know ... It's not good 
to bury a body at night.
[an old-time belief]
The interment will be tomorow morning.
Come on Gheisar khan.
That day you went to Mashhad...
The day after that, Rahim AghMangul 
was found stabbed in his slaughterhouse.
We were supposed to go to Kuwait.
That's life.
No one can not foretell his future.
You didn't see 
how his older brother Mansour felt!
He was so sad.
Soheyla, Mansour's girlfriend 
almost killed her.
This Soheyla girl... 
Does she have any affair with Mansour?
Yes, But Mansour has got disappeared.
Both of his brothers got murdered.
He is afraid. He said...
... "This time is my turn."
This Soheyla girl! Who is she?
Soheyla Ferdous.
She sings in Ferdous Cafe!
There is no God but Allah.
[the Sentence is used in lots of rituals 
by muslims including interment]
- So It's proved that Gheisar
has killed both of them?
- Yes.
A man reading Qoran's verses.
People crying
- Let's arrest him after ritual.
- Ok.
Mother
Mother ... Oh my dear mother.
Come to Pahlavi intersection

Ask people if you don't
know the address.
Thank you.
Thank you both.
He scaped.
Then what about me? Or your uncle!?
Why should we be punished because of you?
Me and uncle are the
only persons left for you.
Screw this life.
What do you think?!
Do you think I enjoy killing them? 
I swear ... no!
I'd like to have a peaceful life.
I'd like to go to work like other men ...
... Go to shopping and
come back home, and
you'd be the person 
who opens the door on me.
Let's scape together!
... We'll leave everything behind 
and make a new life.
Aren't you tired of this situation!?
Let's scape to somewhere!
Yes, I'm tired too.
When some one is misfortunate,
Then that's it.
... But I don't scape. 
Escape is for cowards.
I'll stay.
You should go home. Let's go. 
I'll take you to the station.
I'll wander around ...
... And come to see you 
in the next days ...
... to talk to you; 
Meanwhile I'll find a soloution.
Maybe I'll go to the police department ...
... And give up myself.
Let's go.
[Giving order]
I've been sober for last 20 years...
[Giving order]
- I've been busy ...
Ok ... I'll be right back.
Oh... He is here himself.
- Hello, come here. How are you?
- Hello, give you some ticket?
You look younger than before! Eat

Thanks. I'll take this.
Take it.

I dance just because I like it
... Look at this, Look at that
I'll tousle my wavy hairs
 ... Give me my tip ...
...Then I'll go with you to anywhere
... Tar and Kamanche
I'm sweeter than candies and cookies
I'm so cute and my price is high
If you don't have money... so buzz off
You can not deceive me
And I'm not cheap
I won't give up until my last breath
