Mr. and Mrs. Khiladi
O my strong brother,
before praying to God...
I aIways pray to you so that...
you can put my smaII advice
in your thick brains...
that, your sister is heading towards
her oId age, waiting to be married...
so before I start graying and
have a hunchback, get me married!
You fooIish girI! Why have you
garIanded his photo when he's aIive?
Mother, he has Iost his mind!
Ask him to get me married!
Have patience,
he wiII get you married!
- Sure! - You see, one day my
prince wiII be a very big man!
Then you see how he gets you
married with pomp and spIendor!
Mother, you and brother
shouId stop seeing dreams.
Or, I wiII quietIy eIope
with the postman!
- Aren't you ashamed?
- There he comes!
Maharaj Raja...M.A., L.L.B.,
M.M.B...so many degrees?
Your son has so many degrees?
Did you think it was
the neighbors?
Or, has my son added these
degrees just Iike that?
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Then what did you mean?
Seeing his degrees I thought
of my useIess son!
That rascaI has faiIed eight times
in cIass eight.
- I see!
- His name is aIso Raja.
So every boy caIIed Raja wiII have
the same destiny Iike my son's?
My son is destined
to Iead a royaI Iife!
- By the way, what does your son do?
- He is a peon in a bank.
- I am so sorry to hear this.
- Take your Ietter.
Why are you sorry? His son has
faiIed in cIass eight but is a peon.
But my brother, who has
so many degrees...
has no job, do you know what
he must be doing at the moment?
What?
O my benefactor, my phiIosopher,
she is getting oId...
teII me when my sister
wiII get married?
- TeII me what shouId I do?
- Nephew, don't get disheartened.
Pests and animaIs
are born everyday...
but, the king of jungIe
is born once in a whiIe...
and as per my predictions,
you are a king...
and you are aIready born!
I am born but, teII me when
wiII the money be born?
There is time for that!
- TiII then what work shouId I do?
- You wiII work? Have you gone mad?
You are a king and you want
to work? A king never works!
If a king works then what is the
difference in him and his subjects?
You are destined to Iead
a royaI Iife after one year.
Then, your sister wiII get
married with pomp,...
there wiII be so much
music and fireworks...
peopIe wiII feeI as if America's
war has begun once again!
Gurudev, how wiII this day pass?
Look at the time and
do whatever you do.
Don't get invoIved
in anybody's probIems...
or your stars wiII get angry...
and you wiII be in deep troubIe.
- You are right, Gurudev.
- Now give me my fees!
Don't keep kissing me, uncIe!
I don't Iike these wet kisses!
- That was my fees!
- I don't want to give any fees!
''I need a companion in
the journey of my Iife...
Mr. KhiIadi is aII aIone...
he needs a Ms. KhiIadi''
Why does everyone
hit me aII the time?
My purse!...He's running
with my purse! Thief!!
Is she your sister
that you stoIe her money?
Don't invoIve in anybody's troubIes
or your stars wiII get angry...
and you wiII faII in deep troubIe.
I am in troubIe! I forgot
my Gurudev's advice.
I better run!
- Where is the thief?
- I wiII not teII you.
- I have hidden him. - If you don't
teII me then you'II be in troubIe.
That's why I wiII not teII you,
my Gurudev has toId me...
not to get invoIved
in anybody's probIems.
- You don't get invoIved,
I wiII get! - How?
- Get in, you rascaI!
- WiII you kiII a kid?
WiII you take undue advantage of
the uniform you are wearing?
- What did I do? - TeII me about
the thief, I wiII Iet you go!
If I teII you his whereabouts,
won't I get into troubIe?
ConstabIe, why have
you Iocked up my son?
There comes my mother...mother!
What happened? What offense
did you commit?
He has arrested your son
without any offense.
You wretched man!
May doom faII upon you!
May you be damned!
May your uniform catch fire!
May this poIice station perish! How
can you arrest him without any crime?
Your son has hidden a thief, I
asked him where he has hidden him?
Son, is he saying the truth?
My naive mother! My pIanetary
positions are not right today.
- Oh, God! - My Guru,
Sri Chandamama has said that...
I shouIdn't get invoIved in probIems
or I wiII be in deep troubIe.
And if I teII him about the thief,
I am getting invoIved.
- Nephew!
- There comes my uncIe!
To give a soIution to your probIem,
your uncIe has come to the Iockup!
Hi, uncIe!
- Hey! Who are you?
- Don't you know me?
- No!
- Show me your right hand.
Sir, your right hand
is on your right side.
- Does your wife hit you?
- Once in a day.
I heard that!
Sir, your fate Iines indicate that
you wiII be a poIice commissioner!
But, there is a probIem
in becoming a commissioner.
But, there is a soIution
to this probIem too.
You wiII have to offer food
to Lord Hanuman on Saturdays.
And you don't have to Iock up
anybody in the ceII on a Sunday.
Today is Sunday!
- Let him go! - If I Iet him go,
wiII I become the Commissioner?
- Of course!
- Okay, you come out.
- Come, my son!
- Nephew!
Don't keep kissing me so often!
Greetings and welcome to Indian TV Doordarshan.
You have seen ...
till now that a boy with his
parents has come to see Shalu ...
as a prospective bride. Now
we have to see whether ...
Badriprasad will like
the boy or not. Thank you.
Who is he? Why is he
reIaying Doordarshan to us?or Repeatedly he is
showing Indian tv.
He is Badri Prasad's
wife's brother, Pratap.
He used to work (for Doordarshan) on TV
and is jobIess now.
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo!!
- Where is Badri Prasad?
- He must be on his way.
What is it? Why are you
Iooking at me so shocked?
You are such a rich man then why are
you wearing such ordinary cIothes?
I have enough cIothes
required to cover my body.
I am a son of the soiI,
I used to use a pIough...
then I took up to catching
fishes with a basket...
my business fIourished,
I took boats, then ferries...
then I bought trawIers and today,
with God's mercy, I own 12 trawIers.
I catch fishes and export them...
anyway, I have introduced myseIf...
you teII me about yourseIf,
what does the boy do?
The boy is smart,
he knows everything.
- He has 200 acres Iand.
- Is it? He pIoughs it himseIf?
No, he has 20 tractors for that.
- Oh, so he drives the tractor?
- No, he has 21 drivers for that.
1 is spare...and
he has 500 buffaIoes.
Oh! So he miIks the buffaIoes?
No, he drinks the miIk, he has
servants to miIk the buffaIoes.
What if the servants Ieave the job?
He'II get another one,
they are very rich.
It's a very simpIe job for him.
Listen, money is aIways on wheeIs,
it can sIip away any minute...
after spoiIing such peopIe.
If he Ioses his weaIth, how wiII
he take care of his famiIy?
I don't want a son in Iaw who is
Iiving off his ancestraI weaIth!
I want someone who can earn his
two meaIs with his hard work.
I want such a son in Iaw,
not someone Iike him!
And such shameIess peopIe, inspite
of hearing this, they are here...
ask them to Ieave!
We are going! You don't know
how to dress up...
and you want to teach us
how we shouId behave?
If your son is stripped and
Ieft out in the open worId...
then aII his Iife, he wiII not be
abIe to buy an underwear for himseIf.
- Go away from here!
- We are going!
PIease Ieave...keep moving ahead!
If you get such peopIe again
then you too wiII Ieave with them!
I?!...Look, they have Ieft...
Did you see, Badri Prasad
rejected this boy....
now we have to see if Badri Prasad
Iikes some boy or ShaIu...
wiII choose a boy for herseIf.
So from now, we begin our episodes
on `ShaIu's Iove story' !
So, we shaII meet
again in the next episode.
Nephew...dear nephew!!
Sir, did you see
my nephew...Nephew!!
Hey! You are busy pumping iron here!
UncIe, you are here? Have you
come to reduce your paunch?
No, I have come to teII you
that tiII 12 noon...
don't make an attempt
to fight anyone...
or, you wiII get into troubIe.
Why shouId I have
a fight with anybody?
You are right!
ShaIu, why are you
so crazy about Amitabh?
- He is unmatchabIe!
- That's true.
I've seen his fiIm
`Deewar' 25 times.
I too am his great fan!
I watch aII his fiIms,
first day, first show.
Amitabh is incomparabIe!
Wow! What a beautifuI body!
But what's the point of such a body
if it's not in good hands?
Wow! Such beautifuI cheeks.
But, what's the point of such cheeks
when pretty hands cannot hit them?
- Where is she? - Peter, you are
Iooking for me & I'm Iooking for you.
These are they gym keys,
keep it in your pocket...
I wiII open the Iock after I remove
these keys from your pocket.
Keep it!
Nephew, didn't Amitabh Bachchan use
these words in the fiIm `Deewar'?
Isn't he the one who roamed around
with a badge of the number 786?
Yes, he is the one!
What's your probIem?
WeII done! You have started
a wrestIing match here!
Keep watching for more!
Nephew, she jumps too!
Hey! This mister is doing yoga!
What are you watching? Hit him!
No, nephew! You have to controI
your fist tiII 12 noon!
Go away or I wiII hit you a Iot!
Catch her!!
Run!!
Give me a kiss,
just Iike EngIish fiIms.
O Lord! Save this heIpIess girI's
honor for next 3 minutes...
after that, my nephew
wiII change his fate!
Oh are you going to
take her life? Leave her!!
Nephew only 2 minutes are Ieft.
1 minute more.
HaIf a minute more.
10 seconds Ieft,

Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two...

- Shut up, I'm raping her.
- She wiII die!
Don't mess with me
You need not worry, I am with you!
- Thank you very much!
- What's your name?
- My name is...
I cannot see!
Boys! I cannot see anything,
get him here!
WonderfuI move! Go out from here
and come in from there!
You've changed the fate!
Nephew, he is going!
Come in front!
Nephew! You are wonderfuI!
Friends, this wrestIing match

Jai Hind!
Listen, Mr. KhiIadi...

'' But today is Sunday,

''It's a Friday, don't be stubborn,

Leave me, this is not

I don't want to taIk to you!
Mummy, daddy bought

Eat it, son.
Married woman! I have

You wanted to know the time,

- Give me your ear.
- I cannot come forward.
Let me teII you once more.

Instead of running on the footpath,
if I run on the middIe of the road..
then a car is bound
to dash against me!
- But you just said... - My head is
not working because it's hurt.
Now that my uncIe is here,
my head is functioning fine!
ApoIogize to that girI on my behaIf.
- Strange man!
- I am!
Inspector, you have seen the iron

strength of my courage!
Put me in shackIes, buiId up

ChiId...are you aIright?
Your chiId is strong, daddy!
I heard on the phone

I am not serious, he is!
Why are you referring to
this man so affectionateIy?
- Who is he? - The one who

Perhaps, he is my wouId be husband.
UncIe, what are you

- Hey! Where are you going?
In this episode you are seeing
that my dear niece...

stifIed the neck of the piIIow...
and is sitting in the garden,

A human being commits this offense

- UncIe! - But here it Iooks
Iike she has faIIen in Iove!

Don't joke uncIe, I am serious.
- Have you met him?

There are appIes, oranges, bananas

Daddy and you go to his house and

- He doesn't do any work.
- He is Iike our Government!
Dear niece, any father
in this worId wouId not want...
a jobIess groom for his daughter.
You do one thing, get him a job
in your father's factory.
After that, we wiII
taIk about marriage.
May I come in?
The time of charity is over,
now I shaII rest!
- Come tomorrow. - Your highness,
I have come to taIk in your interest.
- You?
- Yes, me!
- I have got a good news for you.
- And what is the good news?
I have come here to offer
you a job, your highness.
- Oh, God! - Is this is
a good news or a bad news?
You wiII Iose your senses
when you hear about the saIary.
Mother, your son wiII
earn 5,000/- a month!
Rs. 5,000/-!!
Heard that? After a year I wiII
donate that amount to my servants!
- Okay, eat. - You've got a job
sitting at home and you're refusing?
You wiII have to take up this job!
Or, that miIkman is ready,
I wiII eIope with him.
Mother, she wants to eIope
with a miIkman!
You shut up!..Listen son,
it's a matter of an year...
take up this job, get her
married and pack her off...
then Iet me see who stops you!
AIright mother,
I wiII Iisten to you.
But, history wiII be
a witness that...
the king took up a petty job for
the sake of his sister!
Hey! TeII me, where is this job?
Come on, dreamer!
- I wiII sureIy be the king!
- Excuse me, is your name Raja?
- Do you want to change my name?
- No, the boss is caIIing.
- Ask him to wait! - What?
I shouId ask the boss to wait?
It's not a good time to meet him,
what is his star sign?
He is a Cancerian.
- He is a Cancer.
- No, he is a Cancerian.
It aII means the same!
It's a very strong zodiac sign, they
mete out atrocities on empIoyees.
I suggest you shouId pack up
and Ieave this job!
Hey you, in the shorts! Go CharIie,
get me a gIass of coId water!
Okay sir, I wiII get it for you.
He is Cancer and I am Liberian,
there is bound to be a cIash!
- Water! - Don't you have
manners how to offer water?
You wiII remain mannerIess
aII your Iife!
Hey! Isn't he the same? He has put
pictures of his empIoyees?
He doesn't want anyone to cast an
eviI eye on his office, right?
Your boss is far sighted.
Do you have a tongue in your mouth
or a race horse, you taIk non stop!
Show me your hand!
The bad time is over, ask your boss
to interview me in next 10 minutes..
because, I have no time after that.
Come on, hurry up.
This is Mr. Badri Prasad,
he wiII interview you.
- He is the boss?
- Yes!
I don't want to work here!
- Why don't you want to work?
- Have you seen your attire?
I don't work with beggars!
AIright, I wiII change
my attire for your sake...
but, how much saIary wiII you take?
You can give me 10,000/-
- WiII that much be sufficient?
- Okay, give me 12,000/-
I am feeIing sorry for you,
that's aII!
What time wiII you come for the job?
- What time does the office shut?
- At 5 p.m.
I'II be here at 4.45 p.m.
I feeI Iike cutting off your
tongue and hanging it as a tie!
Even I feeI Iike making an underwear
out of your tongue!
I am quiet because of my sister and
that's why I am here for a job!
Even I am quiet because of my
daughter or you'd be in a state...
that you'd never forget!
You wiII have to give me
a bond of one year!
I'II not make it for a year, it wiII
be for 1 1 months and 27 days.
- Why? - Because, after an year,
aII this wiII beIong to me!
I wiII give you a peon's job then.
- You'II have to wear fuII pants.
- Watchman! Throw him out!
Going! Do you want to kiII a kid?
Wants to be the boss!
After a year, this wiII be mine,
you'II be a peon!
Oh God, I don't know whether
he wiII be the boss or not...
but, the other man
wiII sureIy become a peon!
You are right, a young daughter
aIways weighs on the mind of a father!
But it's not a weight that someone
can Iift and throw it away!
AII I meant was that the man
you wish to get married to...
is a useIess man,
he doesn't even have a job!
As far as earning is concerned,
if you'd give him that job...
then he wouId start
earning from today itseIf!
He is the one who Iikes
to be at home and dream.
AII he thinks is astroIogy,
such a man can never do any work!
Daddy, you have
misunderstood my Raja.
He is very naive and simpIe.
Once I get married to him and he
gets responsibiIity of a famiIy...
he wiII stop visiting astroIogers.
Very good, here I am criticizing
him and you're praising him?
Daddy, I am in Iove with him.
So, shaII I consider
this as your consent?
I wiII keep you unmarried
aII your Iife...
but, I wiII never Iet you
marry that useIess man!
This is strange! Inspite of
expIaining so much, you're refusing.
Now I wonder what I wiII do?
- What wiII you do?
- Come on.
- Where? - You have bought
a new car of me.
- Let's go for a drive. - What has
a drive got to do with this matter?
Come on daddy, pIease.
- But, you teII me what is the
matter? - Come on, you'II enjoy!
I think you both are going
for a drive in the new car.
- UncIe, wiII you come?
- Not untiI you drive it first.
- You can go ahead.
- What did he mean?
Let's go for a drive.
WiII ShaIu be abIe to drive?
And even if she wiII drive...
then wiII she be abIe to controI
and if she does...
then wiII Badri Prasad be abIe
to waIk on his feet...
Iet us watch it in the next episode
of `ShaIu's Iove story'.
Daddy, wiII you get me
married to Raja or not?
I wiII die but,
I wiII never do that!
Be carefuI!
Hey! Are you driving for a circus?
I give you one more
chance...think again!
- About what?
- WiII you get me married?
- Where did this come from?
- I picked it whiIe driving.
Have you gone crazy?
- Hey! Stop the car!
- Is the breeze cooI out there?
I didn't come here for breeze,
I came for my treatment.
PIease take her to a mentaI asyIum!
- Have you gone mad?
- It's yet not Iate, daddy.
- You have just Iost the doors.
- This was a new car!
Hey, oId man! Ask her to stop,
I am stiII not married.
My onIy two kidneys have faiIed...
Daddy, fasten your seat beIt,
the pIane is about to take off!
Daddy, Iast  chance
- Have you gone mad? - AIright then!
- The bonnet has gone! - Are you
driving in the weII of death?
Now onIy the roof is remaining!
Daddy, one Iast finaI chance
or it's a totaI Ioss!
- What are you doing?
- No??
Who were they? Which pIanet
did they beIong to?
You idiots! How couId you
Ieave me and go away?
I trusted you and your ambuIance!
What did you think I was?
Move this away!
We are home!
So daddy...here...what
do you think now?
ShaII I consider
this as your consent?
- What consent?
- For my marriage with Raja.
AIright, I give my consent!
- Just get me out of the car.
- That way, daddy.
You are here too?
Why are you after me?
TeII your father that I wiII
be a king after one year...
then, I too wiII have servants,
cars and Iuxuries!
- I'II give your father
a peon's job. - AIright!
Why are you getting angry?
Whether you become a king or not...
you are the hero of my heart!
- Listen...
- What?
- Can I sit here?
- Sit!
- Can I Iie down next to you?
- Lie!
Can I keep my hand...
on your shouIder?
Keep!
- Can I kiss you?
- Yes, do it quickIy!
- Now can I sing a song?
- Go ahead!
''How can you buiId a bungaIow?''
''You cannot buy a car for me''
''You cannot afford to take me out''
''Forget it, Iet it be''
''Let me be seen on the screen''
''Let me become a hero''
''Then you see the magic I work''
''HonestIy, you Iook Iike a zero,
who wiII make you a fiIm hero?''
''The day my fate wiII shine...
that day, I wiII hoId your hand
and waIk down the aisIe''
''This is a way of getting into my
heart, don't sweet taIk with me''
''Let things work out''
''Let me come on the teIevision''
''Then you see the magic I work''
''One day my dream wiII come true...
I wiII possess a bungaIow
at PaIi HiII''
''I wiII be draped in siIks...
we wiII own a fIeet of cars''
''We shaII have bungaIow and cars,
Iet my fate shine upon me''
''Let my photo get pubIished''
''Let me get famous''
''Then you see the magic I work''
- Stay away. Don't come behind me!
- What happened?
You were just singing a song and
having fun so, what happened?
Now I've come to my senses,
I know the reason of my doom!
- Who and where is it?
- In front of me, move away!
How can it be me? What did I do?
I Iove you, Raja.
Don't be siIIy! Get married to
a rich man as per your status.
And forget about me, I am going
to be a king after a year...
I'II have girIs queuing up for me
and if I decide to get married...
then I wiII get married to
a princess of some kingdom.
I am not crazy that
I wiII marry you!
- Niece!
- UncIe!!
- What is the matter?
- Raja has refused to marry me.
- What can we do? - For the first
& Iast time he has done a wise thing.
What I was going to do,
he has done it.
Daddy, if I marry,
I wiII marry onIy him!
ChiId, I have raised you up
with Iove Iike a princess...
to see this day? Have I not
showered any happiness on you?
Look there...that statue is for
two hundred thousand rupees.
This bed, chandeIier,
they aII cost 2.5 miIIion.
AII these accessories in your room,
it costs 5 miIIions!
Did I do aII this to see such a day?
And the room must be
worth another 5 miIIions.
Is it?...Just a minute.
ChiId, you must not shoot
your father over triviaI matters!
I know that...Daddy, the house
where there is no Iove...
what is the point of having
such statues ther
There goes two hundred
thousand rupees!
The house which has no brightness,
why shouId a chandeIier be there?
There goes the Iight
of eighty thousand!
And what's the point
of having exhibits here?
There goes the fish tank!
- Have you gone mad?
- Now I am getting angry!
- What are you doing?
- I shaII kiII myseIf, daddy!
- Get me married to Raja or...
- AIright, stop it!
You win I Iose, you wiII get
married to him, aIright?
But daddy, Raja has
refused to marry me.
What are you doing? It is easy to
change his refusaI to his consent!
- Are you happy?
- Very happy!
- ShaII we go?
- Come on!
GentIemen, what is the purpose of
doing this to my weak, feebIe, body?
Didn't you teII Raja that
he is going to become a king?
You taIk about other's future,
do you know your own future?
- Do you know what wiII happen
next minute? - What does it mean?
If you say you wiII be aIive for
next 20 years, I wiII behead you!
And if you say that you wiII die now
then I am going to kiII you anyway!
But teII me, what am I
supposed to do?
You have to match my daughter's
horoscope with Raja's.
How is it possibIe? I have asked
him to be away from girIs.
Now you get them cIose or this sword
wiII take you away from Iife!
No, pIease ask your sword
not to do that!
Then do as I say or
you wiII Iose your Iife!
- Do you agree?
- AIright, I agree.
- ShaII I move the sword?
- PIease do.
UncIe, it's six and haIf months,
when wiII I be the king?
Your wait has ended, my nephew...
I have matched a girI's
horoscope with yours...
it's so perfect that it seems it's
made on the edge of a sword!
If you marry her,
you'II become an emperor!
Who is she? I don't care if she is
Iame, dark, bIind, Iet me see her!
- Hey! She is ShaIu!
- She is a very nice girI.
She is after me and I didn't pay
attention to her because of you.
Then hurry up now, go to her,
get married and become a king!
For the first time I have Iied
to him because of that sword!
''O driver, ride the cart sIowIy,
my hair fIies...
This is your sister in Iaws photo!
- I am going.
- What are you doing, brother?
HoId this!...I've found my wife!
If I go on the cycIe
I wiII reach her faster!
- Brother! - Leave me,
for my sake, Ieave me!
I said you go inside
and Ieave the cycIe!
Here I come!
Raja Babu has arrived!
Is anyone there to weIcome me?
- Get me a chair.
- Stop screaming out Iike a vendor.
- And stand straight with respect.
- It's you who wiII respect me now.
- After aII, I am your son in Iaw!
- Is it so?
- Who gave you this right?
- Your daughter!
- There she is! - Hey! What
do you have on your face?
I was shaving and I...may I sit?
- PIease sit.
- Can I come cIoser to you?
- Come.
- Can I keep my hand on you?
Yes.
- Can I kiss you?
- Yes, you can.
- How dare you do in front of me?
- Raja, are you aIright?
- Why did you hit me?
- I wiII chop off your neck!
There's a condition
before marriage,...
you have to give
one hundred thousand rupees!
Daddy, the girI's side
give dowry, they don't take.
- Is it?...Get out!
- Listen to me first!
I wiII give you the money,
first you fix the wedding date.
- No, first the money then the date.
- You are such a strange man!
- First fix the wedding date.
- No, first the money then the date!
- What is it?
- Agree to what he says or...
Okay but, if you don't give me cash
of one hundred thousand rupees...
then I wiII not Iet
the nuptiaIs take pIace!
- Move....ShaIu... - Hey! TaIk
to me, what are you doing there?
I wiII not cIap my hand
with yours, get out!
Ask him not to get
friendIy with me...
That you wiII have to!
Mother!...I have got a good news!
- Oh, mother!
- What's the good news, son?
Mother, I have fixed the marriage.
God bIess you, son!
And Iook at you, you just
keep fighting with your brother!
Mother, God bIess my brother!
Listen to me now, I want to
print 1 ,000 cards.
What wiII you do with so many cards?
Listen, if I give one card,
I wiII get back 100 rupees.
And thus, if I give 1 ,000 cards, I
wiII coIIect Rs. 1 ,00,000/-...
and when I get that amount,
I wiII give it to that beggar.
Listen brother, you can abuse me
as much as you want but not them!
Listen to her! He is my father
in Iaw, why is she getting upset?
- Your father in Iaw?
- What is he saying?
- Who is getting married?
- Mother, I am getting married!
How can you do that son, your young
unmarried sister is at home...
and you have fixed your marriage?
Mother, onIy when I get married,
wiII she get married.
And pIease, don't add to my tension.
I have to print the cards
and then seII them.
Don't you get happy
hearing anything?
- You aIways keep crying!
- Mother!!
You keep quiet! My Raja
is very inteIIigent.
- He must have thought of something!
- Rubbish!
Buy a wedding invite,

It's my wedding invite,

- Come on now.
- Hey! Lay off!
I am heIping you out,
I am not taking away anything.
I am just taking hundred rupees and

Do you wish to kiII a kid now?
You can assume you have given money

HaIf the cards are distributed,
I wish I wouId find a good party...

- My father passed away.
- He mustn't have Iived up to 100?
- No, he compIeted 102.
Oh God, you are so merciIess!
But son, don't get disheartened.
Not everyone is destined
to happiness.
It's my nephews wedding

he wouId attend his wedding.
Now that he is not aIive,

Don't keep kissing me! You give

Hey priest, stop it!
This wedding cannot take pIace!
- What are you saying? - You were
supposed to give me the money.
- You have not so, the wedding
is canceIed. - Give me the mike!
Give me that mike...here!
Ladies and gentIemen, due to some
unavoidabIe circumstances...
this wedding is canceIed, we are
sorry for the inconvenience...
this ends today's program,
thank you!
WiII you kiII the kid?
As the nuptiaIs wiII get over,
peopIe wiII start giving me money...
I wiII coIIect that money
and give it to you.
Why wiII they give you money?
They wiII give me wedding gift.
Oh, I see! You couId not earn
with your hard work...
that is why you want to take
donation from them and get married?
I wiII not Iet this wedding
take pIace, canceI it!
- How can you canceI it?
- UncIe! - Yes?
- PIease get some fueI
and match sticks. - AIright.
- But, whom do you want to
set on fire? - MyseIf!
Your daughter wants
to commit suicide!
- ShaII I give her the fueI?
- Shut up!
ChiId, why do you want to
commit suicide?
It's better I die rather than going
back without getting married!
AIright, you do as you pIease!
Let the wedding take pIace.
Sir, I have done what
you toId me to do...
then why are you
weIcoming me Iike this?
Nephew, hoId this sword.
- What's this for?
- When the kings get married....
they hoId a sword in their hand.
If you hoId it,
you wiII become a king.
I will also become?
- Yes!
Come hurry!
Friends, are you
enjoying the wedding?
- Yes! - TeII us, why is the groom
hoIding a sword in his hand?
That's because, the groom
had made a vow...
a known sage toId him that...
if he cuts of the right hand of 200
guests and offers to the God...
he wiII be renowned in this worId
and wiII become the king.
You mean that when we go to
give him his present...
he wiII cut off our right hand?
Yes, you go that right!
Don't say that to anybody or
before your hand is cut...
he wiII chop off my neck!
What happened?...Hey! WiII you read
out aII the vows in my wedding?
Stop aII this and start the
program of receiving cash!
Ladies and gentIemen, now you can
come and give gifts to the coupIe.
Come on, everyone!
Stop looking at your right hands,
give your gifts now.
- Uncle!!
- Yes, nephew.
Sir, congratulations,
where is my fees?
Will you kill the kid, you fatso?
l didn't get anything and
you are asking for fees?
Let me have my nuptial night,
till then you have this apple!
Oh! So you are acting tough
on our nuptial night?
Neither did you wait for your
husband nor did you kiss him...
nor did you offer milk and
are lying down like this?
And, how come you have
become so fat?
You are excited about
our nuptial night!
What nuptial night
are you talking about?
You are imitating
your father's voice.
This is no imitation,
it is reality!
What are you doing here?
- You have to give me money?
- What money?
- One hundred thousand rupees.
- What hundred thousand rupees?
You aren't ashamed of taking money
from your son in law on this day?
You idiot! You promised to give me
this money before marriage.
You did not fulfill it, you promised
that before the marriage vows...
you'd give the money but,
you changed.
Now l will not change, please.
- l will give it after the
nuptial night. - Shut up!
- l said l'll give, please!
- Get lost!
Only when a thousand liars must
have died, you were born!
Settle my account
or get lost from here.
Which bank will be open now?
l will give it to you!
You cannot afford to buy poison
and you are talking about a bank?
- Take it tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow morning? - Promise!
You will give me?...Alright then!
He is still here!
- Let me have my nuptial night?
- When have you promised the money?
- Tomorrow. - Then have
your nuptial night tomorrow.
What's all this?
Daddy, what are you doing here?
He is building a wall of
money between you and me!
- Daddy, you are ruining your
daughter's... - With petrol!
- You have so much money and yet...
- He begs from his son in law.
- Will you let me talk?
- Okay, you talk!
Listen you rascal, if you touch her
without giving me the money...
then l will cut off your hands.
Atleast let him drink the milk.
Why give him milk, it's not
a snake festival today.
He is just too much! What will you
do if l don't give you the money?
Hold this!..lf l catch your neck
and throw you out....
then what will you do?
Listen to me, daddy!
People generally push the groom
inside the bride's chamber...
and you are throwing the groom
out of the bride's chamber!
Why are you doing this to me?
Let me explain, son, if you
don't give me the money...
and try to even step
into my compound...
then l will catch your neck
and throw you out.
- Ask me how?
- Here l go?...How?
Will Raja have his nuptial night?
Will Badri Prasad let him have his
nuptial night without the money?
What will Shalu do? Will she
have the nuptial night...
or become a widow in a white sari?
To see this, let's meet after the
break, with tea, water and juice!
Uncle, l am doomed!!
After marriage, such pranks look good
with your wife, not your uncle!
- Take this and go back to her!
- Stop kissing me, uncle!
- l am tensed.
- Now why are you tensed?
That old man is not letting me
have my nuptial night!
He says he wants the money, after
that will he allow the nuptial night!
You mean you did not
have your nuptial night?
- No!
- That's a very bad news!
- What do you mean? - lf you
don't have your nuptial night...
then your stars of becoming a king
will always be in danger!
- What do l do? - Do anything but,
have you nuptial night!
- Do you have an idea?
- Give me your ear for the idea!
Uncle!!
- Do it!
- l am not a pervert.
Why doesn't this boy ever kiss me?
There, l have found my Shalu!
lt's me, Raja!!
- Raja, you...??!! - Keep quiet
or your old man will come!
- Tell me something, Shalu.
- Yes, dear husband.
Why am l going reverse?
When l cannot bear dirty fishes
outside, how can l keep them at home?
You tell me something, do you
hover around the room 24 hours?
Yes, a young girl's father is like
a watchman of the Taj Mahal!
He has the fear that some vile man
may dirty the Taj Mahal!
Stop it daddy, he is my husband!
Yes daddy, stop it,
l am her husband!
You still don't have the licence
of being her husband.
When you give the money,
you'll get the licence.
Why do you just keep asking
for money all the time?
What do we lack?
l mean, what do you lack?
l lack one hundred thousand rupees!
Daddy, you want to separate
a couple for this petty amount?
Daddy, from where will
he get so much money?
l don't care but, until he doesn't
give the money, he cannot meet you!
Hey, someone! Throw him out!
Going! Why do you ask me to leave in
the old style, try something new!
l am going!...Look at
this new style!
- What is this new style?
- lt's your son in laws style!
Okay, hit me with your slipper!
Son, everyone around is
asking me...
where is your daughter in law?
You tell me son,
what do l answer them?
Simple, tell them l have vowed that
until my sister doesn't get married...
l will not get my wife home.
Anyway, that old woman
has crossed her 20's.
lf l depend on you,
l will cross 60 too!
- There come the old woman!
- l have stopped depending on you!
l trust that Pantya now.
Who Pantya?...lsn't he the
one who cuts my hair?
Atleast he will feed me two meals
and clothes to cover myself.
l will tear his clothes!
Don't talk rubbish!
Why don't you tell her? Her brother
is a king and husband a barber?
- Keep your mouth shut!
- You don't worry about me.
The debtors are waiting outside,
you worry about them!
Yes son, what will you tell them?
Mother, will they kill a kid?
- l will chop them into pieces!
- Oh God!
- Hello...sir...come out!
- Why are you crowding here?
- You've forgotten us? l played
the band. - And l got the horse.
- l am the sweet maker.
- And l am the decorator!
Sir, l read out
your wedding nuptials.
And l printed your wedding cards.
And you are asking
why we are crowding here?
For whom did you do all this?
For your wedding!
For my wedding! Do you know
the meaning of marriage?
lt means that after marriage, the
bride comes to the groom's house.
The couple has a nuptial night...
You wretched men...
neither did l have a nuptial night
nor did my bride come home.
We don't care, we want our money!
Will you kill a kid, fatso?
Do one thing, get my wife here,
l will give you your money.
Let's all go and get money
from that old man!
Wait! l will go on the horse and
you all will walk behind me!
- Okay! - Wait!
The band will follow me.
- Okay!
- Wait...okay, let's go!
Get the mare here!
Cool down!...Come on, follow me!
Come and get your money!
''What?''
''l have totally flipped for you''
''l shall never part from you''
''l love you, O my beloved,
l want to take you with me''
''l have totally flipped for you''
''l shall never part from you''
''l love you, O my beloved,
l want to take you with me''
''l belong to you 1002/2,
l swear it upon my love''
''l shall never betray you,
l mean it 10002/2''
''l agree that you
belong to me 1002/2....
but you are a smooth talker, what if
your words don't prove true?''
''l don't eye other women,
l have no string of affairs''
''My gaze is fixed on you,
there is nobody else besides you''
''The guys are crazy about me
but, l have fallen for you..
you have made me crazy about you
working your charm on me''
''People cry in love''
''Lovers part in love,
you will know my worth....
only when you fall love someone
the way l love you''
- Raja, you?! - Your father will
not let us be together on land.
So l thought of
meeting you in water!
You are great!
- So, let's hug each other.
- Come on!
- Where did you land from?
- From up!
- Who gave you the news?
- The fishes!
- Are they your aunts?
- Yes, they are!
What do you want?
Do you want to kill a kid?
- What do you want tell me?
- Okay, don't cry!
l will have mercy on you today.
Don't give me the entire amount
together, give in 4 installments.
With the first 25,000/-
you can enter my house.
With the next 25,000/- you can
eat your meals with her.
With the third installment,
you can touch her like this.
And with the final installment,
she becomes your wife!
After that, whatever...
- Leave her!
- Can l have my nuptial night?
- You can! - What if l give
the fourth installment first?
What if l make that fourth
installment into the entire amount?
Just ask for money and slip away
like a slippery fish!
You think you can get your way?
Get out from here!
l am going, don't touch me!
Shalu, l will see you again!
l said l am going!
Where are you?
Good riddance of bad rubbish!
Never! You can never get rid of me!
- Come child, he will not leave us!
- Come...hit me!
Where are you going, fatso? You
keep hitting me all the time!
- Saturn and Venus...
- l think you are free.
l am, does it bother you?
Sir, don't get angry,
l wanted a small favor.
- l'll charge Rs.1 ,00,000/-.
- Don't joke with a poor man!
Okay, give me Rs. 25,000/-,
l will manage.
l have a problem in my stomach,
please handle my sheep.
l should handle your sheep?
Do you know who l am?
- l am a king, how can l do this?
- You will have to!
- l will come in some time!
- Hey, listen to me!
This is too much! The kings
are not respected anymore!
People hand over sheep to them!
When the Saturn meet Venus,
there is a change in life.
- Then it... - Brother,
are you educating this sheep?
This is not an ordinary sheep, it
can predict the future, it talks!
- Prove it to me.
- l will charge Rs. 1 ,00,000/-.
- Such a big amount?
- You don't believe me?
lt can predict the future of
your family, buy it now.
- But, l have only Rs. 25,000/-.
- Will do!
- First prove it to me!
- Alright, see this.
Okay sheep, tell me, which
month comes after April?
Wow!...Once more!
Okay, which month comes before June?
Wow! This is an amazing sheep!
Here, take the money, come with me!
Hey listen, before l go,
make it talk once more.
Don't you trust me?
- Who is the sheep amongst you both?
- Answer!
Answer him!
Wow! My family will be happy!
Come let's go!
Okay, the first installment is here,
l can make an entry!
Your royal son in law is here
with the first installment!
ls there anyone around
to welcome me?
You are the biggest stigma
attached to this family...
who will welcome you?
- Here, take your money!
- Watch out! - Why are you falling
at his feet and giving the cash?
l am not falling at his feet,
l tripped on the steps.
- Can l lift him?
- Don't you dare!
l want him to stand on his feet.
Stand up!
Was l standing on your feet
till now?
You were not standing on anybody's
feet, you are like a cripple!
lt's yet not late, learn to
stand on your own feet!
Will you keep hitting me all
the time? Will you kill the kid?
- A kid like you should be killed!
- Then go ahead!
Come on, now hit me!
Raja, why are you sitting
at daddy's feet?
l am not love, give me a hand.
Don't touch her, you have to give
another installment for that!
- l am asking her for a kiss.
- l meant installment of money!
- Take the money.
- Yes, collect it.
Why are you taking it,
come with me.
Don't keep it in your pocket.
Raja, what is this noise?
Hounded by circumstances,
and by their father in low ...
...the romance of husband and
wife is at its final stage.
If that is an ambulance
going, just forget it.
How did you get
so much money?
Nothing much, I just
sold a goat to somebody.
And I got the money!
Shalu, what is your father
upto on the floor?
Raja get up!
And how has the noise stopped?
I will tell you. I knew you
will play these dirty tricks.
That is how I fitted a
transmitter in my daughter.
Daddy, is there a
current in my body?
Yes, so that if he touches
you I will come to know.
Remove the current, or else our
children will be in form of tube ...
lights and bulbs!
I will tell you. Come.
- Ok, Shalu I will make a move.
I will remove the transmitter
when you get the next instalment.
Till then don't bring
your face here.
Whole life, I will not
let him touch you.
I will give you the go by.
Go, fit a transmitter.
I wish this pillow
was of stone.
Will he get next instalment? Will
Shalu just keep ringing bells?
And how will he get it? We
will see in the next episode of ...
The Love of Shalu.
We people.
Hail the Lord!
Say, how can I help you?
Not this side, there.
This is my file, help
whatever you can.
If you can't see, how did you
earn so many degrees?
After his last degree, when he
was singing and going, suddenly ...
... a car ...
- Enough Uncle, enough.
I lost my eyes in that accident.
- There is no juice left in his ...
... life, so he wants to
open a juice factory.
If I get 1,00, 000 Rs
it will be great.
Your intentions are good, but I
can not give such a big figure.
Then give as much as you can.
Presently manage
with Rs 25, 000.
Ok, sir, give Rs 25, 000.
The Singapore payment has come.
Malaysia payment hasn't ...
Your next payment ha come.
I want mu life. Go call her.
Ok!
- Hey, where are you going?
I am going to call his wife,
Shalu. - You stand here.
Are you his man or mine?
- Raja, you have come?
Yes, I have .... - Hold it.
You can not touch her!
You can have only
food prepared by her.
But atleast I can
do the action!
Lord, it is not in my fate
to touch you, but atleast ...
... I will gain a good virtules
by feeding you! Yes!
Let us go. Listen I have
paid you Rs 50, 000. Lets go ...
What will you have?
- i WILL HAVE THAT GREEN VEGETABLE.
wHY HAVE YOU STOPPED YOUR
HANDS? That siren will blow.
Today when I was having
a bath, the fuse blew up!
Shalu, father jas come.
Who was making those
deadly sounds?
My finger got burnt.
I was showing its to him.
Be careful, ok you
go. I will feed him.
No, Shalu can
feed me. You go
I have given Rs 25 000. I will
not eat from your hands.
No, I will not leave. I wil give
RS 100 and eat from a Waiter.
Stop hitting me.
- Go, he id calling you.
One day, I will take away your ...
daughter. Taking a child' life.
Yes, Rambabu, why are you
sitting with your face hung?
Syr, one crook has cheated me
of Rs 25 000
I have taken a oath, till I
nave caught him, I will not ...
eat a morsel.
- Who is he?
Now what to tell ...
That is him! The one who sold
me a goat for Rs 25,000.
He has seen me!
- That is him? Yes.
Bastard!
Run...
Catch him!
Caught!
Not her, catch him.
Who?
What happened?
Don't you recognise me, I gave
you a loan of Rs 25000.
Oh, Mr Bose! But
why are you running?
A thief took away the money you
had given, and also my glasses ...
... as well as my stick. Tell me,
why has God written so many ...
problems in the path
of we blind people.
Don't worry. His need may be
more. Come with me, our Boss ...
... will surely help you.
See his boss and see my father
in law! Money, money, thats all!
Ooops, he is taking me back to
my father in law! I'm finished.
He will have me beaten.
You said, you will take me to
your boss, where have we come?
This is my boss's house. Come.
Now that I have seen it
I will come later.
Since you are here, you
might as well meet him.
Today is Friday. I don't
accept money today.
Mr Bose, how come
this side today?
Why have you worn this?
Nobody should make fun of
a blind man, that is why.
Who is he? - Poor chap is
blind, he wants to meet the boss
Our boss meets blind dumb
and deaf. All! Come please.
Consider my hand as your
stick and come with me.
How did you know there
are stairs here?
God has given eyes
to the blindmen's legs.
Understood, now
right from here.
From there, we have to
turn left.
How did you know we
have to turn left?
Those same eyes which
are in the legs.
Yes, yes, those eyes
of the blind man.
Save me.
Thanks you saved me.
Mr Bose you?
- Greetings boss.
Who is this?
- Poor chap is blind.
Why has he got a helmet on?
He is embarressed of his plight.
That's how he covers himself.
He is setting up a juice factory.
He is collecting money for it.
What a ideal man, and there is
my son in law, a real bastard.
Look whatever it is
he is your son in law.
Don't keep insulting him
in front of everybody.
He is blind, not a deaf!
- Look, you ...
Daddy, uncle is right, what ever
it be, hi is my husband.
You have no right to
insult him.
If he is adain seen here I will
have him slaughtered and sell ...
... his meat in the market
at 4 annas a kilo.
Sir, don't talk against your
son in law like this.
You knifed your son in law, but
this good man is getting hurt.
And if you intervene again, your
meat will also be sold there.
Here, give this to the blind man.
What is it?
Oh it is gram!
He is blind, he can not see.
You! Raja!
Sir, you know him?
Unfortunately, he  is my son
in law.
He is not blind?
No. But having eyes,
hi is blind.
You have fallen so much,
stealing goats and doing frauds?
What to do? I have to collect
Rs 100 000. I have to work hard!
I didn't ask you to do fraud,
and cheat peaple. Get him out.
Nobody will touch me. I am
your son in law not a pimp.
You cannot keep kicking me out
like this. I will go on my own.
I am taking the gram.
This I wil not allow.
If not your daughter, let
me take atleast the gram!
I will not even allow you to take
my garbage.
See your daughter is calling you.
Come Shalu. - Oh, get out!
- Bye, Raja.
Nothing can be made all right
in this house.
Come! - Yes, I am coming Daddy.
You here!
We have come to explain the
Seth, his daughter in our honor.
Go, go ahead!
Who has allowed these
beggars to come in?
How are you talking, brother.
Queen mother, sorry I didn;t
recognise you. You daughter ...
too has come. Where are your
elephants, horses ect?
And today you are not
wearing your royal robe.
How are you talking brother?
Iam speaking your son's
language. He calls himself ...
... a king 100 times a day.
Nowadays he is become a cheat.
He defrauds people of their money.
It doesn't suit you to
insult a poor widow.
Insult? Those who have respect
are insulted. Those who have ...
son like Raja, should
not talk of any respect.
You may give me 1000 abuses,
but don't insult my son!
He only deserves abuses, nothing
else. Instead of worrying of his ...
sister, he goes about like a
vagabond!
He is a totally shamless.
As his mother have
you ever given him two slaps ...
..and taught him anything?
If he was my son, I would ...
have shot him, or
shot myself and died.
If you have some self respect,
go and put him on path, or ...
take poison and die.
Go now from here.
In this serial, we never thought
such an episode will come.
That Badriprasad will behave
like this, this too we never ...
thought possible. Will Raja accept
all this, we will see in ...
the next episode  of The Love
Of Shalu. We people.
Where is that old man
who insulted my mother.
If you have drunk your
mother's milk, come out!
You insulted my mother, take out
your mother, I will insult her.
Your dreams cannot be fulfilled,
she is dead for last 20 years.
And if you say anything against
my mother, I will bury you ...
... alive right here!
Got hurt, isn't it?
For a mother, who died 20 years ago,
you felt hurt. My mom is alive
You insulted her. How she must
have suffered. Can you imagine?
Now what should I call you?
Raja please ...
You keep quiet. Don't utter a word.
You are taking his side.
I have no relation with you.
I have just met a lawyer.
He has told me if the marriage
is not consummated in six months ...
then a divorce can be obtained.
I want a divorce.
Yes, I want a divorce.
The matter is over.
Raja, just listen to me.
Now whatever has to be said
will be heard in the court.
Ok, father in law, I am going.
- Raja, what are you saying.
Hold it.
- Dad, why is he talking like this?
No, son, no. One doesn't punish a
girl, for her father's mistakes.
Her father will not correct
himself. When his daughter ...
gets hurt, only then will he come
to his senses.
Mother, look who is here!
What have you come here for?
You wanted me to become yours.
See I have come.
I know your father too well.
I threatened with divorce, so he ...
has got shaken up. Tell your father,
till he apologises to ...
my mather i sister, I will not
take his daughter in my home.
No, daughter, no. Don't cry.
- I have a remedy for my brother.
What is it? - Samosas!
- What? - Yes, samosas.
Be angry later, first
have hot Samosas.
What is mixed in this?
There are potatoes.
Potato Samosas. My mother
made them?
Yes, mother must have
made them.
Potato!
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...
I will remain yours.
Oh my Shalu.
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...
Shalu will remain stuck with you.
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...
I will remain yours.
Oh my Shalu.
Without Chutney
the Samosa feel a bore!
Chutney too will come,
have faith.
Without Chutney
the Samosa feel a bore!
Chutney too will come,
have faith.
I am your idli,
you are my dosa.
Then let us have one hot dosa!
No, no, no ...
Yes, yes, yes ...
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...
I will remain yours.
Oh my Shalu.
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...
Shalu will remain stuck with you.
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...
I will remain yours.
Oh my Shalu.
I have fought with
everyone for you.
Then come quick
and hold my hand.
I have fought with
everyone for you.
Then come quick
and hold my hand.
My love pulled you here.
You have become my father's
son in law.
No, no, no ...
Yes, yes, yes ...
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...
I will remain yours.
Oh my Shalu.
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...
Shalu will remain stuck with you.
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...
I will remain yours.
Oh my Shalu.
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...
I will remain yours.
Oh my Shalu.
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...
Shalu will remain stuck with you.
Till the potato remains in the samosa ...
I will remain yours.
Oh my Shalu.
Brother. Sister in law's
father has come.
Look, mother come quickly.
The old man has came.
Just move.
Let me see him.
Tulsibhai, Keshavbhai,
Sadiq uncle, come over.
How did you come here?
- Not walking, but a car.
Should we go inside and talk?
- Whatever you want to talk ...
say it openly in front of all.
Ok, if you want it this way, it
is your choice. Give it to him.
What is it, an apology?
- Can't read, I understand.
Just now, we have come to
know, on Wednesday on full ...
moon, Mr Badriprasad is
going to get married.
Congratulations
- You are already married.
Sorry for the interruption.
Mr Badriprasad's daughter ...
is getting married. The people are
requested to come and bless ...
Shalu on the occasion.
How can you get my
daughter in law married?
She was, but is not now.
Brother, keep the respect of two families in mind.
My brother in law has no self respect,
so don't worry about his.
Brother, listen to me. Don't
take such a big step.
Already taken Sister.
- But it can halt ...
... if even one minute before the
marriage, son in law brings ...
... Rs 100 000 and gives it. Then he
can take my dauther. Isn't it?
Ok, if not, my daughter will
become a wife somewhere else.
You can not do this.
- Remove your hand.
You are again taking a child's
life. We are alredy married.
Which child?
- A real infant.
I will kill him.
Come on, thow one lakh on his face
and get my daughter in law.
Don't worry mom. I will give
him a kick also.
Mother, there is absolutely
no reason for you to worry.
In two hours only see how
fortunes change with the stars.
He will bring back your daughter
in law in the same very vehicle.
With all this talk of astrology,
you have spoiled my brother.
You keep quiet. You don't
know how much I love him.
Stop taking those wet
kisses. - Ok come.
Uncle, just have this
cheque delivered to Raja.
He should take out the
money and give to Daddy.
Come, give me that cheque.
Daddy, don't I have even this much
right to take 1 lakh.
Only 1 lakh? All this house, this
money is all yours. If you want ...
.... put the whole thing on fire.
I will not say a word. But if you ...
... give even a penny to that
wastrel, there would be none ...
worse than me. I got you married to him.
But a man ...
who can't even earn one lakh
how can he keep you happy!
But if still you want to give him,
here is your cheque book, ...
... do what you want.
Uncle!
- Father!
No, not today.
Here, take this 1 lakh.
Bring Sister in law home.
Where did you get
this money from?
You have no concern with that.
I will give you one!
Where did you get the money.
Brother. if a woman sets out
to make money, it does not take ..
her much time. - How dare you
talk nonsense in front of me!
You evil woman, just because
you are not married, does not ..
... mean you blacken your face
anywhere and make money.
What have I done? You want to
know where I got money from?
Yes, from where?
Speak from where?
Ok, listen then. Please
sir come inside.
You will marry this rascal?
- He hasn't forced himself on me.
When she told me you don't have
the strength to earn money, and ...
... you haven't money even to bring
your wife, I said I will give.
For one lakh Kiran is
certainly not bad.
Take your money and scram from here.
You come next time, I will
cut you into pieces.
Sister, you have awakened my
lost conscience.
I know why you did
all this drama.
Don't worry. I will get you married.
You also see, mother.
Why lakhs, I will
earn in millions.
I will get you married.
Don't worry.
You want a job? You are Seth
Badriprasad's son in law.
That is why? Otherwise we
were living quite comfortably.
Give me a job. I need a job.
You get me the job.
Nephew, this man knows the old
man very well. He won't help.
You lower your hands.
Come nephew.
See here are my degrees.
I came first here.
Raja, excuse me, I am in  a hurry.
Preparation for the marriage ...
are underway.  I have to go.
Why do you need work? You only
said after 1 year I will be king.
Please forget that,
my eyes are opened now.
But if they close again, as
a king you will hang us.
How can we have the
audacity to offer you a job?
What will happen,
when I get a job?
What will happen,

COME TO TAKE YOUR SHALU.
And if not, come to have

Come Raja. Did you
manage to get one lakh rupees?
Anyway, congratulations.
Tomorrow your wife is getting married.
Have you forgotten the
beating I gave you last time.
You have strenght? Ok I will
give you 5 lakhs.
My friend, who is a Sumo wrestler has
just come from America.
Fight him and win.
You will get Rs 500 000.
This kid, will he fight?
Why not? If he loves Shalu a lot,
he will fight anybody.
Sumo wrestler has finished three.
Now is it his turn.
Nephew, from his face he
looks like mu younger brother.
The only difference is perhaps
I am more fat than him!
You are joking! That man
is marrying off my Shalu.
And I want Rs 100 000 to get
the marriage stopped.
Only he can solve
the problem of money.
How is that?
Whoever wins him will
earn five lakhs. I suggest ...
... you fight him. Till then
I will delay Shalu's marriage.
How? - If you extend your
ears, only then can I tell.
Uncle, stop this kissy business.
All the time you want to kiss.
Go fight then. Go.
- Yes I will fight.
Fight me, and fight with him also.
You have just seen, how my
friend Strongman finished two men.
But there anybody who can
fight with my friend and...
... beat him and win.
Winner will get ...
.... 5 lakhs. Whoever has got the guts, come down.
I will fight this black Strong man.
I will fight.
- Come down.
I am coming Fatso.
Hail the Lord!
I have come to fight putting
my life at risk.
For five lakhs take 4 and give me 1.
Understood.
Ne is the one. Kill him.
Yoa are attacking. I am not fighting
for money but for my wife.
In gym, you exercise a lot.
Come on fight.
Where have you got this
bull from?
Think of one lakh. Your wife
may get married else where.
Camon Kalu, attack him!
Here see this!
I will bite his back side.
Oh what a thick bull
like skin has he got!
I told you, don't
mess with me.
Kill him!
- Don't let off any gas.
What stink you have got?
Don't you bathe?
Oh, I have won. I have beaten him.
Thank you!
Bull, what are you doing a
strip tease for. Hit him.
I just needed 1 lakh rupees.
Oh, oh he has hit me.
Oh, man, what are you doing?
My God, Elephant foot
is coming down.
Just got saved.
Just escaped.
Get aside. Will you take
a child's life?
Shalu will get married!
Get aside!
I will press your stomach.
Saved. Saved again.
You do so much of exercise.
Can't you fight with one man?
What happened to the 1 lakh you
have to give your father in law.
Your wife must be getting
married now. Now what will happen ...
Boss I have an idea.
What is it?
- Marry his wife.
Why should I?
But the idea is not bad!
But in 1 lakh rupees, his wife
is not bad!
Where are you going, Mr Black
Stongman! Take this.
I have won.
Brothers, I have won!
Wait, listen to me. I don't want
5 lakhs, I only want 1 lakh, ..
to bring my wife. You can use the
rest to repair this fat man.
I am going, buy some good clothes.
Don't around naked like this.
Shalu! Where are my clothes? I have to go.
Shalu. Look, I have brought one lakh.
Nephew, you are late.
Not late, but too late, uncle.
Father in law, the fault is mine.
God dave such a good girl.
But I was not bothered. Instead
of working, I just dreamt of
...become a king.
I am happy you have realised the
value of labor and efforts.
What is the use now.
It is too late.
It is not too late.
Your Shalu is there.
See there!
Then who is this?
Yes son. This proposal was
arrenged by your father in law.
And he arrenged for
the entire expenses.
You thought I will
remarry my daughter?
All this drama was to open your eyes
and you realise the value ...
... of life and come out of your
life of dreams and not to ...
... ever fall for the words
of these astrologers.
But sir, my prophesies are all
turninig out to be true.
Raja has already becoming a
holder of Rs 100 000.
After you accept him he will become
a millionaire.
I mean to say Raja will become a Maharaja!
Just tell me one thing.
Will you go from this assembly
after eating your food, or after ...
