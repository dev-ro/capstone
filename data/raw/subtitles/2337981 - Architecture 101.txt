ARCHITECTURE 101
- Up all night?
- Morning, Chief
Tired?
Ow, my back
Gotta let the world know
you worked all night?
Pretty clever
You changed the floor plan?
Isn't it a bit too flashy?
I designed it pretty, didn't I?
Pretty isn't everything
Clients love this kind of stuff
The design has to be flashy
to look good
Go to a sauna,
The meetings at 2 p.m
Why do I have to meet the clients?
You're the designer
Let me get off work
Haven't been home in 2 days
No smoking in the office!
Second-hand smoking is bad
Think of how much worse
it is for me then
You have a visitor
Me? Who?
A friend of yours
My friend? Who?
How would I know!
It's been a while
The alumni directory is good
I'm glad I found you
How've you been?
Who... may I ask?
You don't remember me?
Well...
1st year in college Yang Seo-yeun
Back in Jeongneung...
The music major
Oh, right! Yang Seo-yeun!
Jeongneungu.
What brings you here?
How can you forget me?
I didn't, It's just been so long
Ages
I didn't change much
Still, we got older
Where do you live?
Gaepo-dong
Married?
3 years ago
What does your husband do?
A doctor
What's his specialty?
What is this, census?
It's Jeju-do
When can you start?
Start what?
What?
Why would I come to you?
You build houses for a living
Build me one
Come on
I can't
Why?
I've never done this
Good, then start with mine
Look
I'll refer you to someone
who can do it
A close friend will be better than us
Why?
Is it the money?
Of course not
Then, do it
That's not it. A company has rules
Look
The CEO's at the top
Then, the manager
Then, there are employees like me
Salary men
I can't take just anything
The company won't do it
Of course well do it. We appreciate it
Lee Seung-min
It's your first house
Do a good job
If we start soon, will it
be done before winter?
Let's go down look around
Before that
Why're you building it?
What do you mean?
A rich woman like you?
Why insist on building
a house down on an island?
For what?
The air is nice
Your husband must make a lot
to build a house anywhere
It's investing?
Right, Jeju-do is a hot spot
You can make tons
You talk so nicely
So I'm flaunting money
Still, I can rebuild a house
If you don't want to, don't
I'm not begging anyone for anything
What a waste of my time
Here
And this
Why's the reason so important?
Think I won't pay UP?
It's not that
I should know so I can build
a house that suits
I have to know you better
to make a suitable house
So, you want to know
more about me?
Curious about me?
After college I tried to become an announcer
but failed
So, I just got married
And you?
Do you still live in Jeongneung?
Yeah
How many kids?
None yet
Why?
Just somehow, I guess
This is my dad's place
When he comes out
I want him to live here comfortably
Is that reason enough?
It's a mess
The framework is fine
But it's over 30 years old
Houses are strong like that
What's this?
Someone worked on it?
Dad wanted to expand
but never finished cuz he got sick
It's been like this since
I want it all down
and built new, properly
This is still here?
Dad measured my height here
I was so small
My dad made this, too
When I was 6
I stepped on it before it hardened
I grew so much
I designed it very flexibly
with the sites shape in mind
By putting an atrium inside the house
the living space becomes more dynamic
With the skip floor
the levels are amplified
It adds rhythm to the boxy shape
and draws in the landscape
Know what I mean?
I think this is the solution
- By dividing the space
- But...
What?
Why's everything in English?
You don't know
but this design is...
I said, I don't like it
Don't try to change me
But I liked your clothes today
Except for the tie
Really? Don't like my tie?
So, my design was like this tie?
Show me what a good tie is then
Still, you've improved a lot
from the old days
What was Mr. Lee like?
Ghastly
Not popular with the girls at all
- Hes still like that
- Really?
You two dating?
A duo?
How did you two meet?
I'm curious
You had different majors
Did you meet on a blind date?
Oh, he didn't tell you?
He chased me around campus
What creative story is that?
Let's think about Seoul
the city we live in
We eat, drink, go to school
and do everything here
But do we really know this city well?
It's a big place
So, I prepared a map to
Whose beeper is that?
Turn it off during class
Look. Mark it off like this
As for me
I take bus 38fr0m here
To here
Then here
- Focus!
- Then I transfer to bus 143
Like this
Then arrive here
Come up one by one
and mark your routes to school
You live in Seocho-dong?
Yes, right here
- Then, wheres Bogwang-dong?
- Bogwang-dong?
Is that in Seoul?
It's here, north of the river
Don't you know?
I don't know north of Han River
You live in Jeongneung?
Yes
Whos entombed there?
King Jeongjo?
King Je0ngj0I19?
Jeong Yak-yong?
By next week,
please submit a report
Tour around the area you live in
The alleys and buildings
you walked past without notice
Closely examine them
And take pictures
Liking your neighborhood
and understanding it
That's where architecture starts
Understood?
Jae-wook! Buy me lunch
Do I look like a meal ticket to you?
Seniors are supposed to buy
juniors food
Who says that?
- My old tutor
- Hi, Jae-wook!
Seo-yeu n
I'll get g0il'\9
How was the class? Not too hard?
It's okay
Tell me if you need anything
I1lbuylunch
Take care
Bye
Who's that?
A music major in our radio club
Why's she taking architecture?
Many other majors take this course
Many girls, too
That's why youre taking
this course over?
Shut up!
Come over next week
and help make a floor model
Then, buy us food
Hey!
Doesn't your mom give you food?
Does she hate you?
Seung-min!
Hi, Baffle!
- Coming from school?
- Yeah
- Know that girl?
- What? No.
Where'er ya g0il19?
The library, Where else
How's studying?
Repeating really sucks
I hate studying
And you? Find a girl?
No, man
That's baffling man!
You go to college to date girls!
Who's that? Know the kid?
She's no kid, man
She's my girlfriend
A high school girl?
Who else can a repeater date?
A middle school kid?
- Fool
- What?
What's with your hair college man!
What?
Use it when you go on blind dates
What is it?
You need major help, Hold this
Shake it like this
Then, foam comes out
Then, you put it on your hair like this
- All back straight
- Stupid
No, you are
Slick it back, you'll look cool
- How embarrassing
- See ya
Man
Man!
MQm!
Throw out the stuff rotting in fridge
Shut up!
Come here and help
I have homework
Gotta go
That little
GUARDIAN TREE
Am I out of film? Why isn't it working?
That's odd
Wow, an ant!
You know me, right?
Pardon?
Aren't you in Architecture 101 ?
Are you in 1st year?
Yes
Architecture major?
Yes
Have you lived here long?
Yes
HOW long?
Since I was born
So, this is your hometown?
Then, you must know
the neighborhood well
I just moved here
That's an abandoned house
- Why?
- What?
Well, I'm not sure why
Ah, Miss?
Wait! That's someones house
It's trespassing
It's so pretty
Maybe we shouldn't touch anything
I'm just bringing it back to life
Wait, Miss
Sit down
It's so nice
By the WHY
Why's a music major taking Architecture 101 ?
How'd you know that's my major?
Jae-wook told me in passing
He did?
How about this?
I'm not an architect major
and don't know the area
But that's your major
and you lived here long
So, let's do homework together
That's fair, right?
How's that fair, Miss?
Stop calling me Miss
We're the same age
I will, Miss
Let's speak casually, I already am
You do it, too
Yes, of course
Come on!
I will, Miss
Go ahead
I will, Miss. I will
Just do it!
But we just met
I'll try
This week,
let's go to the farthest place
What's the farthest from your home?
What is the definition of far?
Ever thought of that?
MQm!
I need this washed and dried
How do you expect me to do that?
I gotta wear it, You can do it, Mom
I'm washing up, Have it ready!
Forget it!
There are 42 stops to Gaepo-dong
That's the farthest
I always wondered about
that place since I was young
Gaepo-dong
Gaepo-dong?
Isn't it the name of a missile?
Isn't it Daepodong ?
Maybe not
Seoul is so big
The buildings are so high
Where's your hometown?
Jeju-do
Jeju-do?
Never seen an islander?
Nope
I heard it's a great place
You try living there
I was dying to come to Seoul
Seoul is not all that great
I think everything's great
Apgujung-dong is nice, too
So, your parents are still in Jeju-do?
My dad is. Mom passed away
I'm staying at my dad's friend's place
Sorry
Why're you sorry?
It's not like Mom died cuz of you
My dad passed away when I was young
My friends say sorry, too. For what!
I know!
It's cuz they don't know what to say
Right
Wanna listen?
Whose song is this?
Don't know Jean Ram-whe ?
'Etude of Memory'
Great song, isn't it?
Yeah
- Wanna borrow it?
- Really?
If you're good
I don't know
This isn't it, either
What don't you like about it!
I'm not sure. Just feels unfamiliar
Of course it does! It's new!
How about enlarging it?
Maybe that's why she doesn't
feel familiar with it
Don't get rid of the house
Just fix it up
Enlarge a house that small?
You know, renovations
Just repair it?
Then, what do you need me for?
Will that cut costs?
Forget it!
I have a say, don't I!
How about enlarging it this way?
Expand out front as much as possible
Turn this into one big room
Put in a kitchen here
Then, the front yard
will become the new living room
Does it feel more familiar?
I think it's good
What do you think?
If the client likes it, I like it
How may I help you?
I came to look at ties
These are our new F/W ties
Over here
I asked her to come
Eun-chaehelped a lot
Can I join in?
Of course, have a seat
Should we order?
The wines good here
How long will the construction take?
Probably about two months
If you don't change the design
So, aren't you dating?
Want me to introduce someone?
What kind of women do you like?
A pretty and nice girl
That's impossible
No, it's not
Think of 10 pretty girls
and the nicest one out of them
She's the pretty and nice one
Think a girl like that would like you?
You two are so alike
Hold on
Yes, Chief
I asked Sung to hand the blueprints over
Eun-chae? Do you have a boyfriend?
I'm getting married
Really? When?
End of the year or early next year
Congratulations!
We decided recently
We're going to the States
I'll go study and hell work there
He's really lucky
to have a pretty girl like you
Isn't he?
What's so funny?
- Just talking about you
- About me?
That you're lucky
It's me, The pretty and nice girl
I said that?
What?
You two are together?
I didn't know
Why you! With a pretty girl like this
So sneaky
No one at work knows
It's a secret
But I thought you should know
I heard he met his first love in college
Do you know her?
I'm curious, but he won't tell
It was in his 1st year
Who is it? Someone I know?
O
Who is it? I'm curious
Tell us, You said she's a bitch
A tie in a place like this?
It's not for here
You can wear it when you go back home
It suits you well
Now, it looks like a house
Dad?
Why'd you start renovations
cuz of me?
Who said that?
I met our old neighbor
She told me
When I die
you could come down and live there
Then, there should be space
for a piano
Piano?
You struggled so much without a piano
when you were young
I don't play it anymore
Why waste your talent?
Let's just drop it
So, it's a bachelor?
How can we live, eat
and sleep in one room?
That's our first home?
My aunt says
East Village is a great place to live
It's close to my school, too
Come on, we talked about this
That's all I can do for now
It'll be hard at first, but
Daddy said hed help us out
Don't be so sensitive
Can't you think it over?
I give up!
Jae-wook's so lucky
I can come up with
great designs living here
Retard
A house, a car
all you need is a girl
Is this your new computer?
It's a Pentium with 1GB hard drive
1GB?
1,000 mega bites?
You can't use all that in your whole life
What's this?
Hey!
It's easy
Make a girl drink beer and get her drunk
Then what?
Then
you carry her and put her on a bed. That's it
- So, the stockings are...
- Hey!
Just eat your noodles
Is your club fun?
- Why?
- Just curious
You know Seo-yeun? She's in it, too
Who?
The music major in Architecture 101
That girl? She's pretty
Really? I didn't notice
She's not bad
When girls like her
start wearing makeup in second year
they get really pretty
You don't know shit
Is her boyfriend in the club, too?
The stockings are hers?
- Hey!
- What?
Don't eat all the radish you pig
HEY
Why're you here?
I forgot my keys
Look in my bag
Okay, thanks
Did you eat? Have some soup
OKHY
Come on
Just lend it to me for a few days
Go back to your store!
Come on
- Going straight home?
- Yeah
- You're all grown up
- Bye
Go on home
- Come on
- I said, no!
Seung-min!
- On your way home?
- Yeah
What are you doing here?
Came to get something
- It's heavy
- Right
- Did you eat?
- Yeah
I mean, not yet
Great, I hate eating alone
PORK SOUP
Just go! I can't!
Do you like pork soup?
What guy can't eat pork soup?
Such a city boy
I just don't like it much,
that's all
Tada!
I cleaned it over the weekend
Mopped it and everything
It's my house now
I even planted flowers
In the fall? What flowers?
Curious?
I'm not telling
I went to Jae-wooks house recently
It was really nice
Have you been there?
No. Why would I?
He said
you're really popular in the club
Of course!
Then...
you must have a boyfriend
Nope
- Go bring some soil
- Sure
Why don't you have a boyfriend?
What about you?
Well, no
See? You, too
Jae-wook is the most popular
All the girls in our club
have a crush on him
WhY's he so popular?
He's good looking and tall
He's rich
And he majors in architecture
I think that's cool
I'm in architecture
Oh, right
Just saying
Do you like Jae-wook, too?
Is that why youre taking our class?
Can't I like him?
Still
he doesn't have any interest in me
I have no chance
Learned to drink in college?
How's your girlfriend?
Flurry? She's fine
Flurry? That's her name?
Two pretty girls keep my mind off studying
So, I call em Flurry and Faze
Wanna meet Faze?
No high school girls for me
But Faze is in grade 9
- I know this person
- A girl?
No, a QUY
Somehow he met this girl and
Slept with her?
No, got close with her
They got close really fast
They do homework together
and talk about their family
Then
Why do you think they got close?
The hell are you saying?
Well, I mean
this guy and a girl
were complete strangers
It's you, right?
O
it's a guy I know at school
Screw you, man!
You don't know shit how to lie
So, who's the girl?
Just eat, pal
Yang Seo-yeun?
It's a nice, pretty name
First, buy a bottle of Soju
Then, go to her house
Open the bottle, then call her
When she picks up say I'm right outside,
then hang up
Hang UP?
Just hang up
Then shell get really curious
Why's he here?
Then, shell come out
But you reek of Soju
Shell get scared at first
It's totally baffling, right?
He shows up suddenly
and reeks like liquor?
Then, you go up close
Go up close?
Real close!
Then, shell be scared
and slowly back up
Then, shell go against the wall
Then, you hit the wall
with your right hand!
Shell get totally scared
What are you doing?
Then the surprise!
You don't say a word and walk off
Don't look back
The key is your back
It has to look somehow sad
Don't say anything? Thats it?
Too connotative?
Then
just say one thing
Say, I want you
'Let's live together!'
But how? I don't have a house
Stupid. You don't live
together for real
You just say it, fool
Thanks, Baffle. You're all I got
Why you little
Liking girls now.
You're all grown up, man
Seo-yeun is dang cute
- Damn pretty!
- Okay, man
- Seo-yeun!
- Shut up, fool!
Seo-yeun!
It's embarrassing, man!
Seo-yeun!
Stop! Quiet!
Seo-yeun!
This isn't what I had in mind
You can't tell now
I can't tell from the blueprints
Don't need to
Everythings like you wanted
But
The room is smaller than I thought
This is big
It's 3,600 wider here
with folding windows here
The sofa goes here
The kitchens back there
I don't know what 3,600 means
and the windows seem small
Can't you take it out more?
Then you'll go into the sea!
Look
I left the roof, but raised
the ceiling 600 more
So, it'll look bigger
with the higher ceiling here
You saw it
What now?
You said it was okay already!
We can't change it!
Relax
It's good. I like it
- You said it
- I did not
- You did
- No, I didn't
- You really did
- No, I didn't
You asked me to meet you
when it first snowed that year
No way I'd say something so childish
I don't believe this!
I should've recorded it
Hold on a sec
It looked so big when I was young
But it's so small now
Everything looks small to you today?
Growing these days?
By the WHY
I'm curious
So curious today, too
Guess you are growing
You never lose, do you?
Fine. What are you curious about?
Is the bitch me?
What?
Your first love Is the bitch me?
It's not you
Like we had anything
Right. I thought so
But why do I feel like it's me? The bitch
It's weird
Why's it you?
You have a weird sense of humor
No, Mom
That's Eun-chaes opinion
Don't have to worry about it, Mom
I'm busy now
Everyone in the markets doing it
They're gonna tear it down
Just do whatever you want!
Sell your shop or not!
I gotta go
How can you talk to your mom like that?
They're redeveloping the area
around her shop
It's complicated. So annoying!
When you go to the States
she'll live there by herself?
I guess
What if she gets sick?
You should take care of her
I don't have a choice
That's why sons are no use
Treating your mom like that
What should I do?
Live there forever with her?
Grow old together and die?
I'm just worried, that's all
Why should you be?
Just visit her often
so she doesn't get lonely
Think I'm going somewhere to play?
With rent and everything
I'll hardly get by
Okay, I get it
What do you know?
You have a lot of money, time
and live alone, so you can say that
How'd you know?
That I live alone
I meant...
Just go without me
- Wait! Come on
- Stop!
It's cuz I'm damn embarrassed
Are you mad?
You and your sense of things
How'd you know that I live alone?
Cuz you never once mentioned
your husband in the designing
So, I figured you live alone
Guess it was kinda obvious
But I didn't lie from the start
We were separated
I got divorced last month
I held out as long as I could
For what?
I need the money
My lawyer said
I could get more the longer I held out
Thanks to that
I could build the house
I'm shameless, right?
A real bitch, right?
But I have no choice
It's how the world turns
That's life
Here's the Spicy Soup
Enjoy your meal
Spicy Soup
Isn't it a weird name?
If there's pork, it's Pork Soup
If there's beef, it's Beef Soup
But this is just called Spicy Soup
That's it
No matter what's in here
I don't like it
Then, we should've ordered Fish Soup
It's just
My life seems like Spicy Soup
Don't know whats in it
It's just spicy
Everything okay at work?
Something came up here
I'll go up on the first plane tomorrow
Another bottle, please!
Yeah, she's with me
It's nothing
Okay, BYE
You've had enough
Cancel the Soju, please
No, I want another bottle. You go!
You drank enough, Get up
Okay!
That's enough for today
Are you okay? Get up
Stand up
Why drink so much!
It's okay.
Rubbing alcohol will heal it fast
Stupid
Bastard
Me?
Shit! Everything's fucked!
Shit! Everything's fucked!
Shit! Everything's fucked!
Shit! Everything's fucked!
This weeks assignment is
Where I want to live
Go someplace nice and have fun
Enjoy the weather
- Hey! Why hit so much?
- Don't know!
It's so nice
Today's my birthday
- Today?
' Yup, today
November 11th. Remember
Shouldn't you be having
a party with friends?
Aren't you my friend?
Let's have a party together
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
What do you think
we'll be doing in 10 years?
I'll be an architect and you'll be a pianist
I'm not playing piano
Why?
I'm sick and tired of it
Know what the others call me?
Jeju-do piano school girl
What's that?
Seoul kids had private tutoring
I'm an insult to them
Only my dad's proud of me
What will you do then?
Become an announcer
I'll be a radio DJ, make money,
and become famous!
Announcers make a lot?
Don't they?
At least I can get married to someone rich
Then, I'll build a big house
in a place like this
You build it for free, okay?
Free?
Cheapskate
Here's the down payment
Happy?
I wanna live in a house like this
It'll have 2 floors
With lots of windows and a big yard
Is that too big?
This is the living room
This is the master bedroom
And I'll have two kids
So, the kids rooms go
on the second floor
And I'm going to raise a dog.
A huge one!
Woof! Woof!
And a big front entrance
I gotta pee
There's no bathroom
You keep watch
Stand far away
But not too far!
A kiss?
That's what you call a kiss?
This is a real kiss
Look
Your lips come together
Then, her lips and yours naturally come in
They slither in like snakes
They touch
Naturally, they get like this
They mix
They become one
They rub against each other
like fuckin crazy!
They go back and forth
and rap around like crazy!
Rub! Ecstasy!
That's a kiss!
What you did is just a peck.
Like you peck yo mama!
Stupid
And to a girl whos sleeping?
That's a crime, man
I'm beat
We played,
walking on railway tracks
What's that?
Don't know?
Whoever falls off
the tracks first loses
That's so lame
Listen
She says the winner
hits the loser's wrist
You don't hit wrists
unless you're close right?
You have to hold hands. Right?
What else?
Punch each others face?
He//0, campus
Fall is nearly over
I recently planted ﬂowers
in the yard
A friend asked what flowers I planted
But I didn't tell what they were
It'll be another reason
to wait and look forward to spring
Todays last song is
by Jean Ram-whe
'Etude of Memory'
Did you hear me on the air?
I did
How was it?
Your voice sounded great
HEY
What are you doing here?
The bus would've been fine
It's okay
seniors can drive juniors home
He's sleeping so comfortably
Are you close with him?
Well, a little
Then, good luck with him
No way. We're not like that
Look at his shirt
GUESS starts with G,U,E
The spellings wrong
That's so fake
Oh, it is!
G, E, U...
Jae-wook?
How much is the place you live in?
Why? Thinking of moving?
Yes, my dad told me to look into it
Really?
Another member to the Ritz then?
The Ritz? What's that?
Nickname for the most
expensive area of Seoul
Come by my apartment to
look around and stuff
I'll buy you drinks
Really? Can I come over?
Of course, anytime
When do you wanna come?
Anytime you're available
- I'll get off here
- What?
- Take care. See ya
- Hey!
What's with him running off like that?
So? How about this weekend?
Sure, anytime
Saturday's good
You're home?
Where'd I put the Aspirin?
My head kills
What are you doing!
What's with you today?
Can't we move, Mom?
Move?
To like an apartment in the Ritz area?
What the hell are you talking about!
You earn the money and move if you want
Throw that shirt out!
Why! It's fine!
Why you! Got money
coming out of your ears?
When I only sold $20 worth today!
Okay, okay!
Can't you stop saying that?
$20! Again?
Man
Why that little!
Damn kid
Just break it why don't you!
He must be out of his mind!
There's only one thing left to do
Just tell her
HQW?
Ask her to meet on the first day of snow
That's saying I like her?
She could think it doesn't mean anything
What women would think that?
Then, shed be a bear
If so, it won't be worth dating the bitch
Who're you calling bitch?
Forget it, man
I'm teaching aesthetics to a guy
who can't even do factoring
Forget it, man!
Fine!
I give UP
What! You didn't even do anything!
I just want Seo-yeun to be happy
That's it
Hal9I9Y? Happiness?
What the hell?
Wait
are there 2 Ps or 1 in happiness?
Can't be 3
Give me one
No way, man. This is for adults
Give me one!
Try asking nicely, man!
Here
Take a drag, then blow
A drag?
Suck in the smoke, then gulp it down!
What the hell?
Damn
My precious smoke!
Is it heavy?
No, I like lifting heavy things
We're almost there
That's my place
Be honored
You're the first guest to my house
Are you happy to move here?
Of course. It's my own place
And it's in the Ritz as they say
Wanna see pics?
Look!
I grew a lot
This my dad
This is me
This is my house in Jeju-do
- This?
- Yeah
See? I'm the tallest
I used to play a lot with these friends
I can go back by myself
It's okay
I'll walk you to the bus stop
You don't know your way around
You don't know this area
Now, we can't take
the same bus anymore
Complete opposite ends
I kinda got attached to that neighborhood
What are you doing
on the first day of snow?
What? When's that?
Well, I'm not sure...
When winter comes?
Do you wanna meet up?
Soundsfun
Let's meet
in the empty house
on the first day it snows
Okay?
Well, okay
Promise!
I'm Mr.Yang Sang-yun's daughter
He suddenly had blood pressure
problems and got worse
Is he okay now?
He's stabilized for now
Well have to wait for
the CT scan results tomorrow
- Hello
- Hi
You came?
What are you doing?
Errands
I love the basalt in the yard
Can we put more in?
It's perfect as is. No more
Let's just eat
PIANO SCHOOL
Know this place?
I started taking piano here
It's still the same
Let's go eat. Aren't you hungry?
Why're you dying to eat?
Starve yourself?
I wanna buy you seaweed soup
For what?
For your birthday
It's November 11th, isn't it?
What?
I'm wrong?
Did you change your birthday?
No. It's my birthday
Then, what?
Cuz you're cute and sweet
Where's my present?
This is it?
Sea urchin in seaweed tastes really good
There's something I want
I've never tasted anything like this
Can I say it?
What is it this time?
I need a room for a piano
I gave it a lot of thought
I'm going to settle down here
My dad
The hospital can't do much for him now
He has 1 or 2 years left
It's not a long time
Spending that time with him
I think it'll be good
So, I won't regret it
And I wanna take the time
to reset my life
Start fresh. Cool, huh?
For real?
Yes
Are you crazy?
I don't get that woman!
It's going to be done next week!
Is she kidding?
She says shell pay
all additional costs
Money's not everything
It'll take a month to redesign it
What about our schedule?
Next months our wedding!
I told you
She wants to settle there
That's her problem!
I won't do it
I can't
Just hand it over to me
You get ready for the wedding
No, I'll do it
I'll finish it
Let me do this
We can't expand it any bigger by law
So, let's put the piano here
What about my room?
We'll put it upstairs
Make it into a two-story house
You'll get hurt
Don't worry, I won't
I'm scared of getting hurt cuz of you
The depth should be 30cm
for enough light to come in
It has to look good
so please be extra careful with this
- Enjoy your meal
- Thank you!
Wanna go around again?
I meant 150 with the finishings
We gotta do it again
The movers are coming on the 28th
E verythings going b y boat so its crazy
Take things slowly
Thanks for listening to
my boring lectures all semester
Feel more familiar with architecture now?
- Yes
- Class is over
There's an after-party
Hope you all stop by for drinks
Dismissed!
Jae-wook?
I heard you moved
Not too long ago
Then, let's stop by the party
and I'll drive you home
But have you seen Seung-min today?
Seung-min? No
I can't be friends anymore
My mind, my heart won't allow...
Damn!
It's freezing
I like you
That's it
Where are you?
Why aren't you answering?
Page me when you hear this Okay?
Recorded
What are you doing here?
Nothing
Here
But I can't really drink
Me, neither
Seo-yeun? Are you okay?
We're here
Seo-yeun? Can you walk?
Seo-yeun?
You Okay?
Seo-yeun?
Let's go in first
Is this it?
Down here?
Careful
Where're you headed?
Huh?
Jeongneung
I can't go there
WW not?
I can't go north of the river
at this hour
Let's go
No, I can't
Close the door
Go to Jeongneung
Close the door

Crazy little bastard
What did you just say? Fuck?
Go home quietly if you're drunk kid
Go to Jeongneung!
Get away!

- Go to Jeongneung!
Who'd go that far at this hour!
Crazy son of a bitch!
Go to Jeongneung!
Why you little!
Get away!
That bitch!
That stupid bitch!
Forget her
She's not the only girl
Forget a bitch like that!
When I go to college next year
I'll look after ya
But
Just cuz they went in together
that doesn't mean anything happened
He could've just took her home
cuz she's drunk
I'll bring Flurry and Faze over
We'll meet on the first day of snow
And have a double date
We'll have snowball fights
and make snowmen
Slapping wrists, too!
Doesn't that sound awesome?
Seung-min?
Cheer up, pal
This way, please
You're here?
All done
When are you completely
moving down here?
As soon as Dad gets out of
the hospital
It's all finished, huh?
All over
How do you feel?
It was good to build this
I'm glad I did it
And you?
How do you feel?
Not sure
You didn't like it?
You made a promise
to build my house
Remember?
Tell me
Why were you so nice to me then?
Because I liked you
Now, you tell me?
It took long enough
You knew?
Think I'm stupid?
Of course I knew
You even kissed me
When I was asleep
That was my first kiss
It's late. I'd better go
OKHY
Take care
Bye
Want me to move this?
No, I'll do it later
It's not much
Where do you want it?
It's okay. I'll do it
Why'd you come to me?
Anyone could've built your house
Why'd you come to me now?
I was curious
What?
How you're living
How you are now
I was curious
That's it?
Just cuz you're curious?
That's why you had this all this time?
Yes
That's why I had it
Why can't I hold on to it?
When you're...
You were my first love
I called many times
But you never answered
I don't have a CD player
I can't listen to it
And don't call me anymore
Why?
Just don't
What do you mean?
Now...Get out of my life
- How's this?
- Hmm?
This is better, isn't it?
I think it's better, too
I must've gained weight.
It feels tight
Doesn't it look too racy?
It's suffocating
Suffocating? Where?
It's so stuffy I feel like
I'm going to die
How can I help you?
Wanna go for a walk?
- I want to go home
- What?
I want to go home
Okay, let's go home Dad
It's all built
We can go and live there
Wanna see pictures?
This is the living room
and the master bedroom
And here...
Who's this?
He's just
A friend
Pork Soup?
For old time sake
You can't eat that in the States
Should I just stay, Mom?
What the hell are you saying?
You'll be alone. I'm worried
Shut up and cut the nonsense
Fool
Here
It's my wedding gift. Use it
That's for selling your shop
Move to an apartment with it!
Live comfortably for once!
I forgot the Kimchi
Where's my head?
Don't worry about me
Just be good to your wife
Not again
I lived here for over 30 years
Expect me to go someplace new
at my age?
I'm gonna live here till I die
Don't say that!
You're not gonna die
If you get old, you die
Aren't you sick of this place?
You struggled your whole life here
Why would I be sick of it?
A home is a home
Why's it so hard to open?
- I'm gonna take a nap
- Okay
You're playing a little fast
Let's practice it 10 more times
- Okay
- Ready?
Have a good day
- See you tomorrow
- Bye
Dad, let's go in. It's cold
It's okay
I love this
