Do you know how fast
you were going?
No, I don't, Officer.
Turn that radio off, please.
That's not the radio.
That's the band practicing.
Is that marijuana?
You got a party bowl up there?
Mm, nah.
It's okay, it's okay.
Is it good?
Mm.
Yeah. Open it up!
I'm fucking boarding you!
5-0!
5-0 coming on board.
Officer, you can't
just waltz on in here!
Do you know
who these guys are?
Unplug this shit right now.
No way.
No fucking way.

Holy shit!
You guys are the highway cops
that got shut down
and became local cops.
Then due to some
kinda crazy "incident"...
you got kicked off
of that force,
so you started playing music.
And before you knew it,
you won America's Got Talent.
You're Cracklin' Bacon!
What a long,
strange trip it's been.
I love you guys!
Oh, I gotta tell my partner.
He's not gonna believe this!
Okay, hold on.
- Dude, you gotta get over here right now.
- Copy.
He's gonna shit his pants.
You know what
would be hilarious?
When he comes on the bus,
kick him in the nuts
as hard as you can.
- Really?
- Just drill the guy!
What the hell
is going on in here?
Oh, my God!
You're Cracklin' Bacon!
You guys are my favorite band,
like, ever!
What? You didn't even know
who Cracklin' Bacon was...
until I played them
for you.
Yeah, I did!
Oh, really?
What's your favorite song?
"Pulled Pork."
- Yeah? How does it go then?
- Uh...
♪ I'm gonna eat you
like a pulled pork sandwich ♪
♪ Get inside your bread
like a hot steak Manwich ♪
This guy's got some pipes!
Hey, how would you like
to join Cracklin' Bacon?
We're looking
for a new lead singer.
Holy shit!
Yeah, oh, I can do it
better than him.
♪ I'm gonna eat you

♪ Kung Fu you
like a Jackie Chan-wich ♪
Not bad.
You guys clearly
have the sound.
But do you have the moves?
Hit it.
Fist-pumps!
Pelvic thrusts.
Shake your tail feathers.
Shake that ass.
Now kiss each other.
I'm sorry. Come again?
Come on, rock and roll!
Rock and roll, baby!
- Do it!
- Kiss him!
Kiss him! Kiss him!
Kiss him! Kiss him!
I knew
you were fucking with us.
You're fucking
with us, man!
All right, all right.
You guys clearly have
what it takes
for rock and roll.
But there's one more test
you gotta pass
before we let you
join Cracklin' Bacon.
We wanna know if you can
keep up with Juicy Lucy.
She looks
pretty juicy to me.
Oh, no, she's
in the back, okay?
But I warn you,
she can be quite a handful.
Let's go handle that!
Juicy Lucy!
Juicy Lucy! Juicy Lucy!
About to get juicy up in here!
Hey, baby.
Hello, Juicy Lucy.
Oh, that's not Lucy.
Lucy's better.
Oh, man!
Fellas, on the other side
of this door
is everlasting fame and glory.
You get the giney,
I'll get the hiney.
Say hello to Lucy!
Move it or lose it!
It's time to cruise it!
Let's do it!
Motherfucker!
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- Crap damnit!
We sang our hearts off
for those guys. Our hearts!
We got company.
Can't outrun the law,
motherfucker!

Fuck you, Cracklin' Bacon!
Whoa!
Oh, shit!
Motherfucker.
Eat it. Eat it.
Eat it. Eat it.
Ah.
Suck these
fucking bullets, bitch!
Oh, shit! Mac. Hey,
stay with me. Stay with me.
We almost got
those stupid cops...
- ...to kiss.
- Shit.
What's that?
What the...
Whoa!
Shit!
Hey.
I still love those guys.
Yeah, they're cool as hell.
I mean, look at him.
Still cool.
We should probably hide
that body, though.
Yeah.
Hey, great driving, Thorn!
Thorny? Thorny?
Oh, my God! He's dead!
- Oh, no!
- Ha-ha!
- Aha!
- I got you, motherfucker!
- I'm not dead! I'm alive!
- He's alive!
Look out!
Holy...
Ahhh!
You sleeping, baby boy?
No, I'm just checking out
the ceiling, Farva.
Good work up there.
All right, pull out your caulk
and let's go.
What?
Let's go! I'm standing here
with my caulk in my hand.
Grab your caulk,
let's put it in the holes!
Come on, let me see
that big caulk.
Oh, shut up.
Show me your Rabbit caulk!
You know
what's funny, Farva?
You've made that joke
400 times
and it still sucks.
Fuck you, Mac.
You don't talk to your
site supervisor like that.
That's one demerit
on your permanent record.
On my permanent
construction record?
That's right. You want
another one, keep it up.
Yeah, give me another
and I'll pinch your dick.
- That's two. You want to go for three?
- Okay.
Bingo! You got it!
You want another one?
- Pretty, pretty please.
- You got it!
- You want another one?
- I'll take them all!
That's seven!
You want another one?!
Give me ten!
Bingo!
Mac! Stop.
You mess with the bull,
you get covered in bullshit.
- What a tool.
- Yeah.
I had the craziest dream.
Who were the cops this time?
Stifler and Damon Wayans Jr.
Did they almost kiss?
Yeah. Yeah.
Almost got them to.
Uh, hello.
- Morning, Mac!
- Good morning, Uncle Argyle.
Code names? Is Farva nearby?
Oh, yeah. Spitting distance.
Do me a favor,
spackle his mouth shut.
Okay, will do.
So, change of location for
this weekend's fishing trip.
Just over the Canadian border.
Oh, sweet! I love Canada.
Good one!
I'll mail you the address.
- What, like with a stamp? Just text me.
- Text?
Oh, you mean like,
uh, mail text? Yeah.
I do believe I have
that facility on this phone.
Okay, will do.
That's it. I'm teaching you
how to text this weekend.
- No personal calls, Mac.
- What the fuck?
- Whoop.
- Oh, God damn it, Farva.
- I told you no personal calls.
- It was a sales call.
Oh, yeah?
What were they selling?
Ooh, was it canned salmon?
I love canned salmon.
It's better than tuna,
you know. It's a salty fish.
I like a salty fish.
Like a grouper
or maybe a branzino.
Something that really
jerks off your blood pressure.
You know what's salty? Turtle.
You ever had turtle before?
Saltiest part? The shell.
What do I have to say to get
you to end this conversation?
You could say,
"The guy on the phone
was trying to sell me
hard dicks."
The guy on the phone was
trying to sell me hard dicks.
I bet you bought
a baker's dozen.
Let's lay some caulk!
I got fresh caulk, everybody!
Hot caulk here.
Who wants caulk?
He really wants to leave
right from work, huh?
He said,
"Real men travel light."
God, he looks ridiculous.
No, I think
he looks pretty cool.
Like the Brawny
Paper Towel Guy.
See, I was gonna say
the Bombay Paper Towel Guy.
- Hey, Thorn.
- Hey.
Job sucks.
It's all sap and splinters.
Now it smells like Bombay.
- You wanna put that shirt back on?
- Whew!
Breathe it in, little fella.
That's the smell
of a mountain man.
Right. Okay, what time you due
back at the hobo zoo?
Hey, hey!
What's up, guys?
Nice ride!
Hey, Chief.
Son of a bitch.
- Ta-da!
- Hey!
What's up, Foster?
He is all yours.
I'm tired of him riding
in my sidecar anyway.
That's not what
you said last night.
Chief, we have a 214
out at
the Shuck n' Rack Motel.
Officer needs guidance.
- I'll be right there.
- Copy.
I wish you guys
didn't get fired.
We weren't fired.
We were invited to resign.
- Ah.
- Ooh, I like that.
No, you were fired. There was
that ride-along gone wrong.
Then you were fired.
We'll just have to agree
to disagree.
All right.
Well, you fellas have fun.
Just get him back
in one piece, all right?
With the rod. I'm gonna
need it next weekend.
Hello!
That's my girl.
All right, boys,
let's go fishing.
And the beauty is,
the black is so black
that it's really blue.
I mean,
it's really midnight blue.
Ah, just like
the old days, huh?
Driving around
the countryside,
listening to Thorny
talk about his dick.
- I miss the old days.
- That's bullshit, man.
That Fred Savage thing
was not our fault.
Actors shouldn't
do ride-alongs.
Actors shouldn't even
try to play cops.
I mean,
they never get it right.
- Hey, there.
- How you doin'?
Good. You boys here
for business or pleasure?
- Just going fishing.
- Good timing.
You'll be up to yer tits
in the walleye.
I caught one last week.
Was seven kilograms.
Is that big?
Is that big? That's like nine
decimeters from tip to tail.
- You a jigger man?
- What did you call me?
Well, I like to use
the jigger rod
for when I'm catching
the walleye.
But of course
when you're doing that
you gotta run extra light.
Unless you're someone like
you there in the back.
- What are you, a bodybuilder?
- No.
What do you bench?
Wait, don't tell me.
I don't want you
to embarrass me.
- But I would like two tickets to your gun show.
- Ah, okay.
You guys are good to go.
Sorry to hold ya up.
- Let them go!
- Thanks! Take her easy.
Typical Canadian hardass.
"Sorry.
I'm really sorry. Sorry."
"Oh, so sorry."
Hey,
fellas, any chance you can
come over to the house later
and play some Sorry?
Sure.
How about nine o'clock?
Ooh,
nine o'clock doesn't work.
Sorry about that.
French ones are the worst. Ha!
Would you
like some ratatouille
with your pain du chocolat?
Oui, oui! I'm gonna get
some jambon et fromage.
This can't be it.
Well, this is the address
Cap sent me.
Although he did just learn
how to text.
Now what would compel somebody
to throw a tire
up on the roof?
What, you never played
"Throw the Tire on the Roof"?
No, is that the kind of shit
you guys played in Rutland?
Sure. Never got
"tired" of that game.
Uh, we are
in the wrong place.
No. You're in the right place.
What's the deal
with the creepy,
remote shithole, Cap?
You gonna make us put
the lotion in the basket?
No, I've got a surprise
for you.
I didn't tell you up front
'cause you tend to be
a bunch of
wide-mouth bassholes.
Well, then, why don't you let
me reel in these fish, John?
Governor Jessman?
Hey, I didn't see
the motorcade.
- We're keeping my visit quiet.
- Mm.
Oh, Cappy, you dirty dog.
Show some respect, Mac!
Sorry.
I'm here
on official business.
We've got
an intriguing situation
going on in these parts.
With all the heat
on immigration these days,
the U.S. has been
going through
a border reassessment.
It turns out that some
of the original stone markers
that delineated
America from Canada,
weren't where
we thought they'd be.
Here is where the border was.
But here is where
we found the stone markers.
So this town,
St. Georges du Laurent,
and the area surrounding it,
are actually on American soil.
So we're going to war?
Ah, gee,
that'd be a quick one, eh?
No. After negotiations,
they've agreed
to turn the land over.
Vermont's about to get
- a little more head room.
- Hm.
So, it was up to me to find
a temporary police force
to help with the transition.
A group of officers
familiar with the border area,
experienced in patrolling
a stretch of highway.
Guys who maybe caught a bad
break the last time around?
So, you fellas want
a crack at your old jobs?
Easy, you hooligans!
I'm a senior citizen!
And if this two-week
assignment goes well,
I might be able
to make it permanent.
Trust us. It'll go well.
And who are you?
Oh, I'm one of the cops.
We picked him up
outside of Home Depot.
Fantastic.
You'll be phasing out
a Canadian Mountie unit.
We lined up a meet and greet
with them tomorrow.
Oh, yeah!
I wanted to make sure you had
your full team back,
so I tracked down
your other guy too.
No fucking way.
Oh, no.
Sorry I'm late.
Hit a moose doing 90.
Vaporized the beyotch!
You know they have
Eskimo hookers up here?
When they have sex,
they really get "Inuit".
Pelé!
God damn it.
Farva, you fuck.
Back in business!
Bullshit! Who ordered these?
I can't feel my tits!
Hey!
Desk buddies, guy?
Are you positive
you want to quit your old job?
I mean,
Construction Supervisor.
And give up the chance
to crack some Canuck melons?
I don't think so, bro-haim.
♪ Welcome to the Fart Zone ♪
Body armor, check.
Tactical flashlights. Why not?
Ooh, heat vision goggles.
Check.
Why would we need those?
Uh, we're in Canada now,
Rabbit.
What if we have to find
somebody in the snow?
Uh, there is snow in Vermont.
Okay,
I'm the "order stuff" guy.
You do your thing. All right?
Okay.
One yellow safety vest
for Rabbit.
Woo! A roving
GPS triangulator.
Triangulator? Get a load
of James Bond over here.
Another yellow safety vest
for Thorny.
Thorn, Thorn, Thorn,
Thorn, Thorn, Thorn.
Ram. Rod. Ram. Rod. Ramrod.
You're out, he's in.
Okay.
Hey, place looks great!
What have you
been cleaning, Cap?
I'll clean your clock
if you don't watch out.
Okay, let's get started.
Don't push it, Mac.
Get started
doing some pullovers?
No, we're not doing
your pullovers.
Everything will be
by the book.
Everything!
Cap, you know how hard
I worked on this thing?
Big face, big mustache.
I don't care how big
your face is. Shave it!
Cap, Cap, Cap, Cap!
I'm good, right?
I got a tight mouth-muff.
- Talk about big faces.
- That's face-ism, Cap.
Not regulation! Shave it!
Right! Let's go
and see some Mounties.
Remember the three
B's: Best Behavior, Boys.
Hey.
- How's it going?
- Feels like 1983 in here.
Oh, there they are.
I am Mayor Guy LeFranc.
Mayor of Saint Georges
du Laurent, Canada!
Or, as it's about to be known:
St. George of Lawrence,
America.
I don't know. I'm not so good
with American. Welcome.
Uh, the Guy LeFranc?
From the Montreal Canadiens
Minor League system?
The leading scorer
of the Halifax Bear Eaters?
Eighth most points
in CHL history.
Yeah, I know. Two points
behind Shotti Fitznugly.
Look at this guy!
I love hockey.
Your nickname, um,
don't tell me,
it was, uh, "The Explosion".
"The Halifax Explosion."
Named after
the single greatest
man-made explosion
before Hiroshima.
It was 1917,
ship laden with dynamite
crashed into another ship
in Halifax Harbor.
Tremendous explosion
and loss of life.
Burned people's eyes out
with the blast.
Many were blinded
by the light.
Like the song says.
And a First Nations tribe
was lost.
Probably would've
happened to them anyway,
but it kind of moved up the timetable, eh?
So, I am the second biggest
explosion from Halifax.
But enough about me.
Meet the Mounties. Guys!
Guys, come on over here.
This here is Sergeant Major
Roger Archambault.
This is Staff Sergeant Major
Henri Podein,
and Sergeant
Christophe Bellefuille.
Total gobbledygook.
I'm John O'Hagan.
This is Rod Farva,
Robbie Roto, Carl Foster,
MacIntyre Womack
and Arcot Ramathorn.
I'll let
you guys chew the cud.
Why don't we go fuck off
to the other room here?
Yeah, sure.
I'm gonna get a Schlitz!
That's American for beer.
So, you do guys
ride horses or...
Yeah, this isn't 1957.
We drive Crown Victorias.
Hey, us too.
You get a little soup in them,
they can really rip
your knob off. Am I right?
We hear about you guy, heh?
Because first, you get your
highway station shut down.
And then, you get kick out
from your second job
because of this, uh,
Fred Savage thing.
"Savage."
Makes it
sound intriguing, at least.
So, what are you going to do here?
Go for the hat trick?
Well, we're actually hoping
to hold on to these jobs.
What are you guys
doing after the turnover?
Oh, they're transferring us
up to Labrador City.
- Oh!
- Cool.
It's cool, all right.
Average winter temperature
is minus 18 degrees Celsius!
Yeah, all you have
to do to convert
is times two, add 32 and join
the rest of the human race.
Hey, Rookie,
they got non-alcoholic Molsons
over here.
Want me to get you
a half carafe?
Oh, we got a rookie there?
They shave your nuts yet?
Canadian tradition says
you got to shave
the rook's nuts,
otherwise it's bad luck.
- You don't say?
- Bad luck?
I'm actually not a rookie...
Which one of you guys
has least seniority?
I mean, technically I...
Shave this guy ball!
Come on,
shave both of his ball.
Shave your ball, your dick.
Hello,
hello! Welcome to Canada.
I'm Genevieve Aubois,
Cultural Attaché
of Saint Georges du Laurent.
I will see that
things go smoothly
in the next few weeks.
And please,
if you have any questions,
don't hesitate to ask.
Keep heading north,
big fella.
You don't look at the mantel when you're
poking the fire, you know what I'm saying?
- Right, guys? You know what I'm saying, right?
- Jesus, Farva.
Okay.
Well, they are waiting for us
in the other room.
So, please, suivez-moi.
Who is waiting where?
Boy, I didn't know the whole
town was gonna be here.
Oh.
It's about my
mustache, right?
They're laughing
at my mustache?
Please, let's give a big
Canadian welcome
to the Vermont Highway Patrol.
Hey, hey, everyone!
Come on, guys.
They've come up here
to tell us how great
it's gonna be
for all of us
to become Americans.
So, let them speak. Captain?
Uh...
Bonsoir.
You know, this reminds me
of the story of the rabbi,
the priest,
and the Hindu in a canoe.
Go blow yourself!
I'm Captain John O'Hagan. I...
Yeah, eat it, you old donkey!
Hey, easy.
Hey, look, look.
Technically,
we're all Americans, right?
North Americans.
Very little is gonna change
around here.
Oh, yeah, right!
You're probably gonna tell us
we can't listen
to Rush anymore!
Or the Barenaked Ladies!
Hey. Hey. Hey!
People, people.
I love Rush
and the Barenaked Ladies.
You should listen to both.
So, you are telling us
who to listen to!
No, no. I'm just...
And then that one's
gonna tell us
we have to start
eating tortillas!
- It's a common mistake.
- Bullshit!
Hey! Listen up.
This is America now.
Like it or lump it!
Repeat after me:
I pledge of allegiance
to the flag
of the United States
of America.
Learn the words!
Learn the words!
Fuck you!
You don't even know
how to play hockey!
I didn't think they'd see us
as an occupying force.
Oh, my God!
Your eye.
That might leave a scar.
I was looking
too pretty anyway.
I can sew you up at my car.
You're a doctor?
No, no. I coach
the girls' hockey team,
so I know my way
around a gash.
Are you making a...
Oui . A double entendre
for la vagine.
Let's go, quickly!
I thought Canadians
are supposed to be harmless.
Oh, come on.
Cut them some slack.
They're upset
about losing their identities.
They called you an old donkey.
Doesn't that piss you off?
Well, I don't love it.
Actually, I didn't sleep
at all last night.
But we got a job to do.
- Rabbit, how's your head?
- It's okay.
That, uh... Genevieve,
she, uh, patched me up.
Oh, please!
Frenchy had her eyes
on my thighs all night long.
- Yeah.
- Did she, now?
Oh, yeah?
Keep laughing.
I bet you a buck I bang
the crêpe out of her first.
Okay.
Put your money
where your mouth's been.
Fuck the buck.
Loser sits on a cactus.
No, loser gets a perm.
No, loser cuts his
pinky-toe off with a shovel.
Take that bet.
- I suggest you take the bet, Rabbit. Really, honestly.
- Jump on it.
Please shut up, Farva.
Okay. We have a deal.
You heard it, right?
We have a deal.
Oh, so, this is where they
keep the illegal aliens, huh?
Ah, welcome, Officers!
Welcome to the guys
who stood around
while people threw
hockey pucks at us?
You gonna
come up here talking
all that
"Make America Great" crap,
you're bound to catch a face
full of Canadian tomato.
Okay, okay.
Listen up.
Two of you are gonna ride
with the Mounties.
They'll show you where
the bodies are buried.
- Not it.
- Actually, it is you two.
It's not our idea
of a good time either, fellas.
Personally, I'd rather
fuck a moose.
You would need a ladder
to do that.
Obviously, I would need
a ladder to fuck a moose.
But I would find one,
and I would fuck that moose.
Okay!
Thorny, Rabbit,
I got a highway job for you.
Let's do it!
Hey, Cap? Cap?
Whose car do I ride in?
Why don't you
stay here with me?
Sit over here.
That's the radio, though.
Great idea!
That way, if a call comes in,
you can answer it.
Huh?
Okay, just today, though,
okay?
Everyone takes a turn.
It's a new station.
Fuckin' radio.
What the fuck is this shit?
I mean, it's not gonna
kill him, is it?
I don't know. Do you
want it to kill him?
Allons-y!
Just a minute!
Just a, uh...
What's Canadian
for "minute"?
Ah.
There they are. Okay.
Hm.
Are you swallowing
M&M's whole?
Yeah. The green ones
make me horny.
Why don't you chew them first?
They all go
to the same place, right?
Hey, Farva,
can I get a radio check?
Why did you shock
your buddy, buddy?
You know, every job has that
one guy that you love to hate.
Yeah, obnoxious. Oafish.
Oh, yeah, you mean like
your typical American?
Still waiting
on that radio check.
Fuckin' shit!
This is an awesome assignment.
Oh, come on, it's great.
Outside. On duty.
Hey, what's 80 kilometers
per hour in English?
I guess
49.7097 miles per hour.
Uh, I don't think
we have any decimals.
- Do you have a Sharpie?
- Uh, no.
Unit 23. Come in, 23.
Unit 23. Come in, 23.
Radio, until the turnover,
we have to keep things metric.
So we are now Unit 37.015.
Try again.
Whatever.
I got a call out
on Rue de Autoroute 77
or some
Frère Jacques bullshit.
There's a gaggle of dead
Canadian Geese on the road.
Yeah, up here, they just
call them geese, Radio.
Yeah, well, in two weeks,
I call them American Geese.
Honk, honk. Go clean them off.
That's a big 16.09-6436,
good buddy.
Ah, ya,
there's the Pancake Shed.
And that's the Flapjack's.
Oh, there on the right,
that's Gigi's Bait,
Tackle and Pancakes.
- But they're really known more for their waffles.
- Yeah, they are.
Sounds like the Queen
must really love pancakes.
What's that supposed to mean?
Aren't you guys still
ruled by the Queen of England?
I mean, she's
all over your money.
I'll have you know that
we achieved
our independence in 1982.
- Ooh!
- Oh!
1982.
Did Wham! perform at the ceremony?
Maybe if we had
our independence sooner,
we'd have no gun control,
not believe in evolution
and all be morbidly obese
without healthcare.
Why don't you
pull in right up here?
Time for you to meet
the local business owners.
Escorts?
Here we are, boys.
Are we here
to bust up a cat-house?
You can't arrest
people for having boners.
It's legal up here, Yank.
A hockey-themed,
dual-sex bordello.
Do we have that in the U.S.?
I don't know,
but put me in, Coach.
Oh, oh! Look who it is!
It's the fuzz.
The Mayor hangs out
in a bordello?
No, the Mayor
own the bordello.
Here you go, boys.
How about a beer and a tug?
On the house.
- Hey!
- Oh, uh...
Uh, maybe later.
Oh, I understand.
Scram, girls.
- How's it going, eh?
- Yeah, no, no. Maybe later.
You guys!
You don't like women,
you don't like men.
I mean, what should I get, a
river beaver to pleasure you?
It's a joke. Their teeth are so
sharp, it would be horrible.
How can I help you fellas?
Oh, the Yanks want to talk
about their U.S. laws.
You know,
like serving weaker beer
and shutting down brothels.
Shutting down
brothels?
Who put you up to this?
Was it Jean-Paul
down at Chez Poontang?
Huh?
You guys pulling my chain?
Look, I don't think
this is anything
we need to get
too hung up on right now.
I can't believe
down in the States,
it's illegal to have a beer
and enjoy tits and a dick.
I mean, beep beep!
- There's no harm there.
- Oh. Uh...
- Good workout, eh?
- Wow.
Honestly, Guy, we're not
here to lay down any laws.
We're very sorry if there's
been a misunderstanding.
"We're sahrry?" "Sahrry."
I'm sorry,
but that sounds stupid.
- So sahrry.
- Sahrry.
It's funny. I know.
And what exactly
is your beef with our beer?
Oh, I don't have
any problem with the beer.
I mean, I think the limit in the U.S.
is what, nine percent?
Nine percent? How are you
supposed to get drunk?
I mean, you know,
I think the idea is you drink
more of the weaker stuff.
I bet it is.
You Americans drinking
and eating everything.
- Oh, no, you shouldn't.
- So fat.
How about a little help
over here, huh?
Yeah, I don't think we have
jurisdiction here anymore, buddy.
Okay, all right.
It's not like we're here to
"screw you" out of your rights.
Darn tootin' you're not.
Okay, look, relax.
Go away, you American pigs!
- Go home!
- Oh!
Take it easy.
Fight, fight, fight, fight!
Sorry about that.
It was an accident.

Good one.

Oh, boy.

You ever hear

That embargo

Not for me it isn't.
That's like sucking
Castro's cold wrinkled dick.
Cuban cigars,

and unmarked pills.
We got something here.
You boys stumbled
on quite a booty closet.
A what now?
Booty. Contraband.
What? They don't say
"booty" anymore?
- Not really, no.
- Nah.
Canadian counterfeit iPhones?
We should call them
"A"-Phones, eh? Right?
They all have the same number?
That's a rip-off.
So, what pills do we have?
Not sure.
Five different kinds.
None of them have markings.
Send them to the lab.
I tried! The U.S. lab said
send them to the Canadian lab.
The Canadian lab said,
"Oh, ya, hey there.
"Send 'em over
to the U.S. lab there."
Maybe the Mounties
have some pull?
Boo!
Fuck the Mounties!
- Fuckin' Canada.
- Fuck that.
For all we know,
this was the Mounties.
Easy on the local cop

We'll solve
this case ourselves.
I'll put a call

Wah, wah!
I don't need some nerd

I've gotta hand it to you,

Okay. All right.

You feel anything?
Wet mouth. Sweaty palms.
Moist ear canals. And I'm

Hm. Okay.
I think you took
a Canadian female
sexual enhancement drug
called Flova Scotia.
"Made in Canada,

When the time is right,
but you're not.
Flova Scotia, eh?
Side effects may include
wet mouth, sweaty palms,

queefing, and bitchiness.
Flova Scotia, eh?
You can say "queefing"

What about you?
You're awful smiley.
I'm on acid.
Pharmaceutical acid?
Is there such a thing?
Don't know. But I do know
you have exactly
1,509 hairs in your mustache.
Close! 1,521. I had them
counted for my birthday.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Yeah!
I don't know

- Okay.
- Don't you do that.
I'm really looking

Well?
You guys come up
with anything?
Indeed we have some
very interesting leads.
Some of them

I think that we are
on top of this case.
We're gonna
find out who did this
and we're gonna stomp in

Okay.
Well, the shack's a dead end.
It's on abandoned land owned
by a defunct mining company.
So, anyone could have
put the booty out there.
Why you laughing, Guy Smiley?
Okay, if we
stake out the shack
maybe we can catch
someone coming or going.
Let's get back out there.

Farva stresses me out.

You think he's good-looking?
"The bigger the cushion,

- No.
- No.
I would rather have sex

It's funny though, huh?
We all have that one
horrible person we work with.
For me, it's my office manager
Lonnie Laloush.
Oh, he can be
such a "deeckwad".
What?
It's just with your accent,
the way you say "dickwad"
is adorable.
No, but it's true.
He is a deeckwad.
First you steal our job
and now you sit here
gazing lovingly
into the eyes of our women.
Your women?
Well, maybe we should
take him in the back,

What's that?
Let's just say it involve
a bag of hockey puck
and a lot of warm gravy.
Mm. Sounds delicious.

Uh, non.
Ooh, woof woof. Put a little

Okay, I'm going to go.
It was great seeing you.
Don't leave on my account.
Uh-huh! Cocky, huh?
How about we up the bet?
There is no bet, Farva.
Okay, new bet then.
Loser not only cuts off
his pinky toe with a shovel,
he puts it in a blender
and drinks it in a smoothie,
toenail and all.
Come on.
Shake it, don't mistake it.
You're serious?

And I should know.
I've had two.
- Wow.

Somebody clean this up.
Son of a bitch.
Hey!

Looking hot, Mac.
Hey, nickel plated cuffs!
Oh, shit.
These things are defective.
What's wrong with them?
They don't seem to lock.
Here. Let me see.
Here you go, Rabbit,
give me that hand.
- I got mine to work.
- Maybe it's this one.
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah, that works. Okay, good.
Try the ankle ones.
Oh, you always gotta
check the ankle ones.
That's the most important.
And here we go.
You son-a-bitches.
You're not shaving my balls!
It would be an insult to our
Canadian hosts if we didn't.
I'm not a rookie anymore.
Get these off me.
Do you not want to be
an ambassador of goodwill?
No. I don't. Get these off me.
Rabbit, it's not like
we want to shave your balls.
Thorny, do you want
to shave his balls?
- Me? Hell no.
- Foster?
- No way.
- You don't wanna shave his balls, do you, Farva?
Hell yeah, I do!
I even went out and bought
one of those
old-timey straight razors.
- No. No.
- Check this out.

Dude, the orgasms are

You can't keep taking

It's gonna mess you up.
Jealous much?
Now who are you
orgasming with?
Her name is Quebecois Debbie.
Oh, Thorny, your cock,
she is so wide.
I'd fuck her.
- Okay, let's shave this.
- Don't.
Ready?
Seriously,
cut the crap, guys.
Ahem!
There's a bear in the station.
Is that a euphemism
for something?
It's a euphemism for
there's a goddamn bear
eating slabs of raw meat
in the goddamn station!
- Yeah. Bear.
- Okay.
Where are the guns?
In the room with the bear.
Tear gas grenades?
- I just got a new delivery!
- There you go! Where is it?
In the room
with the guns and the bear.
What if we send Rabbit
out to fuck the bear
as a means
of distracting said bear?
- Yes.
- God damn it,
we've got to get
the meat out of there!
Fine, fuck it. I'll do it.
- I'll go with you.
- Really?
Yeah. What's the worst
that could happen?
You get mauled by the bear.
Or that bear
could get mauled by me.
- You ever think about that?
- No, I didn't.
Okay, here's the plan:
I'll go out there
and distract the bear,
while you get the meat
and get it the hell
out of the station.

Please don't start

I know. I make joke on him.
He think I don't know

You know who is my favorite,

Yeah, then they steal

These guys put a bear in our station!
A real bear. Big bear!
You don't have
any proof of that.
A real bear?
Maybe. And maybe
they deserve a bear!
Nobody deserves a bear!
I give a bear to you!
We could have been eaten!
Why you laughing, Guy?
Fellas, you are thinking
about this all wrong, eh?
These guys?
They impersonated officers.
There is no way they're
holding onto their jobs.
And I'll do you one better.
When I get done talking to my
good friend Justin Trudeau...
Eh, the Prime Minister!
I bet you this
whole turnover thing
goes right out the window.
Boom!
So, boys, unpack your bags.
Revive those cable bundles.
'Cause you are
not going anywhere.
I say we celebrate. What are
we having for breakfast?
- Pancake.
- Pancake, yeah?
All right.
Oatmeal and raisins it is.
- Oh.
- Kidding. It's pancakes.
Eh, pancake! Maybe two eggs
side by each, eh?
I don't want this oatmeal.
Maybe you put the
raisins inside the pancake.
Genevieve, wait.
You brought this
on yourselves.
They put a bear...
This is bad, fellas.
This is "Fred Savage
Ridin'-Along Incident" bad.
Tell that to Fred Savage.
Well, no sense in having
good breakfast go to waste.
- I've lost my appetite.
- I'm sorry, man.
I'm just not hungry.
You try to do something
nice for people,
and then it just,
I just, you know.

I like to chew mint gum
when I'm on the road.
When I'm radio, it's fruit.
You know, like Juicy Fruit,
Bubblicious, Hubba Bubba.
Anything fruity.
On the road,
I like mint, though.
Mint, mint, mint, mint, mint.
And Beech-Nut,
have you tried that?
They should call it
"Beech-Not!"
Oh, shit, I'm gonna
write that down.
What kind of gum do you chew?
They should make
a black mint gum.
That would be choice.
They could call it
"Minty Black".
Yeah, I'm gonna
write that down too.
- No one would buy that.
- What?
No one would buy
that stupid gum.
Bullshit.
They'd buy it
if it was on Friends.

You follow me out here while I'm

I'm not looking at your dick.

Dumb fuck.
Unbelievable.
Who pops an airbag?
God. You weigh a ton.
You gotta be shitting me.
Don't die on me, Farva.
Okay. You can do it.
Oh! Fuck!
From upside down,
your mustache looks
like a big hairy smile.
Why would you
give me the Shocker?
My way of saying, "Thanks,
honey. You saved my life."
I was dead. I went to Heaven.
And you were there.

- What?
Trying to make out with me,
sweetheart! I'm on to you.
Come here.
Give me some more of that.
What the hell is that?
Well, hello, Laverne!
Looks like the same stuff.
Yeah, but a shit-ton
more of it.
Holy Hindu holidays.
There's a new guest
at the party.
AK-47s.
Hey.
Oh, no, I don't
want to hear it, Rabbit.
Genevieve,
could I just explain?
There is nothing to explain.
They put bears
in our station.
This is Canada!
There are bears everywhere.
There are bears that
go through
my garbage every night.
I have cereal
with bears in it: Bearios.
Canada's most
popular breakfast.
Someone say "Bearios"?
Hey there, Genny.
Wanna grab some eats?
No, thanks.
Turn that into a maybe
and I'll have your baby.
Lonnie Laloush?
That's mon nom.
Don't wear it out, eh?
You want a hot coffee?
I'm pouring.
Oui, s'il te plait.
Seems like a real

I told everyone
how wonderful you all are.
Well, you're not.
You have bad hearts.
Who wants crème fraiche?
Nobody?
Okay, no crème fraiche!
- Please just go.
- Genevieve...
Just go.
They're actually AK-48s.
Illegal in the U.S.
Why 48?
Because they hold
one extra bullet.
Yeah, sure. You never know
when you're gonna
need just one more.
This one says "Tiger Penis".
Suck it!
Shut up, Farva.
The Chinese use it
to get hard-ons.
I tried to get it once.
You can't buy it in the United States.
Dude, what's up
with your mustache?
Nothing.
- Are you wearing a mustache wig?
- No!
It's a postiche, okay?
I'm having a little hair loss.
Don't worry about it.
Worry about your
own goddamn mustache.
Fuckin' asshole.
Hey, Mac tell you guys
about our little moment?
Did you, Mac and Cheese?
You told us, Farva.
I don't want to hear it again.
I'm the Cheese.
All right, look, guys.
I know we're
in some serious shit here,
but if we can crack this case,
we might just be able to get
beyond this
whole Mountie thing.
We didn't do anything.
Foster, we kidnapped
and impersonated
officers of
a sovereign nation.
Right.
Cuban cigars, Canadian pills,
counterfeit cell phones,
AK-48s and Tiger Penis.
What's the link?
All this stuff is
more valuable in the U.S.
than in Canada.
So, it's
a smuggling operation.
Someone's trying to move
this shit over the border.
No, they're not.
Think about it.
This stuff is just sitting on
Canadian land. Yeah. Okay.
But what happens
when this Canadian land
becomes American land?
No need to move it at all.
It's already on U.S. soil.
Exactly, huh?
Passive smuggling.
It's my kind of crime.
So, they must have this shit
stashed all along the border.
Yeah. But who is "they"?
Who "are" they.
Hey, look,
I said this earlier
and you guys laughed at me.
But I think it's the Mounties.
They are shit people. Okay?
And they smoke Cubans cigars.
We've seen that.
They're getting transferred
to God knows where.
I mean, what
do they have to lose?
I am starting to agree with
Sherlock McSerpico over here.
Ooh!
I'm telling you, fellas.
In my experience,
it's always the local cops.
What would you guys give me
if I kill that bird?
Farva, that's a Bald Eagle!
Get a wig, baldy!
Yeah!
Put the goddamn gun down.
What?
Oh, booyah!
Guys, what do I win?
A one-way ticket to hell.

Why?
'Cause it's always
the local cops.

This will be gone

I'll have
the butter tart yule log.
Come on. Chop-chop!
Just do it, dude.
Canada!
And the beauty is,
there's nothing they can do
with all that contraband,
until this land
becomes America.
So all we have to do
is push back the turnover,
until we can find
the rest of the stuff.
Well, you heard LeFranc.
Who knows what's gonna happen
with the turnover?
Whatever happens,
we gotta solve this case. Now.
Let's take another look
at that contraband.
We may have missed something.
Hold on! I didn't
get my free dessert.

we could locate them.

Enhance.
- Enhance.
- Okay, okay.
"Sciere de la Vache."

French, what does that mean?
I don't
know what sciere means
and I also don't know
what vache means.
So you really don't
understand anything?
Sciere de la Vache?
I believe it's
"The Scary Vase".
Yeah, yeah. Let's

hidden contraband is found.
So, wait.
Are we Canadians
or are we Americans?
You're still Canadians

And that's going

Sorry.

Mr. Savage,
we can't let you do that,
because, you know, well,
we're responsible
for your safety.
Don't worry about it.
I'm an expert climber.
Remember the movie
Super Monkey?
Yeah.
I did all my own stunts
in that movie.
I'm good with the trees.
Okay.
Look at him go. Wow.
I can see it!
I got the cat.
Take it easy, Mr. Savage.
I thought Super Monkey sucked.
Yeah. And the monkeys
were so fuckin' fake.
- A.O. Scott said the plot was bananas.
- Hey, buddy.
Hey, you know,
I can hear you guys.
Alright, you should try
acting in a movie
and doing your own stunts.
It's really hard!
- Sure.
- All right, don't be dicks.
Woo!
Did you see that shit?!
Any of you motherfuckers
want some pussy?

from a chair
in the center of the mall
with our women.
Can you shorten that?
No, that's the only way
I can say it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Jeez Louise.
