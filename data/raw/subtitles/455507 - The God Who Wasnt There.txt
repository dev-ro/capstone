Beyond Belief Media presents
a documentary of Brian Flemming
Earth wandering around the Sun.
But it was not always so.
The Sun once roam around
from Earth.
This thought for hundreds of years.
So to be discovered
was not so.
For several hundred years
following the same thought.
But after much effort,
Earth started wandering
around the Sun.
Christianity made a mistake
on the solar system.
Is made a mistake and something else?
This movie is about what
happened, and looking for Jesus.
"Jesus was the savior and our main
and had escaped from the path of God,
but we loved so much as sent
the only son of so
to make the intermediate
between us.
The people who created
in the image and on the model. "
"Who was Jesus. Jesus was
the Messiah to Jews.
And was the savior of mankind. "
"He is the son of God,
who came to save us,
and came here to give his life
for our sins. "
"Jesus is someone who came
in our world as a man,
came and died for us
echyse his blood, so be freed. "
"Jesus was the son of God,
the only son of God.
And this is the best answer
I can give. "
"He was someone who came to the incredible
love for the world
to give his life for all. So,
For me Jesus is my savior. "
"You can not know whether the theory is
true, until you try.
So why not try Jesus?
Look how happy are
Christians, when talking about Jesus.
How are so happy?
I too am
so happy.
Of course, these are not the only persons
of Christianity.

a similar apocalyptic literature
Well, I suppose that this
for confusion.
If you have not heard
history, this is a short version.
It all started here, in this field
Some shepherds were sleeping
and woke up a star.
Angel presented the Lord
and told them that
a new king was born in
Bethlehem, and so happened.
And then the shepherds began
to find the newborn king.
Meanwhile in Bethlehem, the virgin
Mary gave birth without complications.
The news for the new king who
Jesus said had spread to the entire country
magicians and 3 were
with gifts and
we all celebrated the birth of
baby Jesus.
Slaughter of infants
King Herod learned about birth
the new king
and sent the army to kill
all male babies in the region.
Thus, an angel came to the Lord
warned Joseph
and thus unable to leave the
family in Egypt.
"When Jesus was 12 years old
Joseph and Mary
the went to Jerusalem for
Easter, as usual. "
"Since returning home with relatives
and friends suddenly realized
that Jesus was not with them. "
- Do you have seen Jesus nowhere?
- No, not you.
I thought that was you.
The lost, while leaving the sanctuary;
salim, but thought that was you.
"After 3 days of searching, they decided
go to church and ask. "
"And there was, sitting
among teachers
listening and
by questions
and everyone was surprised to hear
with understanding and answers "
Son, why we did this?
Your father and I look at
anxiously.
Why looking for?
You know how I would be in the house
of my father?
And after Jesus ignored
for 18 years.
Reappears when it is 30 years old
and had to be dubbed.
So he went to John the Baptist,
which made the service.
And after the baptism, Jesus goes
40 days and 40 nights in the desert,
where to put temptations
Satan.
Then the miracles began.
Lazarus, defro out!
Entry to Jerusalem
Then Jesus went to Jerusalem,
was very angry with the local authorities
The feeling was mutual.
This Jesus, rouse the world from
the Galilee to Jerusalem
with the psefdokirygmata.
We do great thanks to the country, although help -
tions n 'rid of psefdoprofiti.
Jesus knew how to die
the next day and thus
prepared a final dinner
with his students.
Second take, fagete. This is my åóôß
the body for you klomenon.
Eat it for you remember.
I tell you, will not drink again from the
fruit of the vine
until the day I will drink with you
the kingdom of my father.
Demand in the name of God
tell us whether or not you are the Christ.
I say this to you,
that will see the son of man
be perpendicular to the right of the Father.
Committed blasphemy!
Why sit still and listen?
Everyone listened to the blasphemy.
What is your decision?
Death to the blasphemer!
Must die!
"It was too early in the morning,
when Pilate heard the news. "
The sun has not yet dawn,

Then Jesus
resurrected from the dead.
"Taken up and a cloud
took from their eyes. "
"Jesus left you
and went to heaven
will return in the same manner
the saw to go to heaven. "
I will be with you always
until the end of the world.
After the death and resurrection
Jesus
in your own words, what happened next?
How Christianity spread?
JOY, DAUGHTER Mission
ALL OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE
Christianity spread by the
pentikostianous think
And the power of the Holy Spirit,
I think, spread the gospels.
Why are Christians so
specific to the life of Christ,
but are confused on
what happened after he left?
And was in accordance with the plan of God,
because if you look at history will show
that God has made some
situations and events
to help disseminate
the gospel in the world.
They say Christians leaders
what happened?
Do you know anything about how the spread
Christianity in the early years?
Spread.
from mouth to mouth.
As far as I know, spread
through history
The Holy Spirit came and gave them
the strength and the ability
talk about Jesus
and to disseminate it to the whole world.
Let's go back in time to
see what really happened.
Far behind
Let us turn to the first century,
the time of our Lord.
Jesus Christ said that he lived here
the first 3 decades of the century
dying around year 33.
The gospels
came later.
Marcus was the first written and
3 others are inspired by the Mark.
Marcus says the destruction of
Jewish Temple, which was 70 AD
Thus, all the gospels
came after that.
Probably much later.
There is a gap 4 decades
or more.
The more we know about this
period is from a man
saying that he saw Jesus
to speak in a dream.
It is the Apostle Paul, or else
known as Saul of tarsus.
"After many days of laborious
journey, the caravan of Saul
was near its destination,
to Damascus. "
The trip was almost over.
Then suddenly
- Lord, it is sick!
- Lights! The light!
Saul, Saul,
Why downs?
Are you sir?
Paul says the Lord told him to
spread the word Jesus Christ.
And he did it with passion.
Your heart is not
right before God.
Xerizoste this weakness, you
because I see that you are
on the verge of losing.
Paul was a little unprepossessing, but the
salvation offered by God
who called Jesus,
became very popular.
He traveled far and over
leaving behind the young Christians,
who formed the first
Christian church.
Paul wrote many letters
about Christianity.
It wrote about 80-thousand
see words on the Christian religion.
These texts represent almost
everything we
about the history of Christianity in
During the gap of 4 years.
And here is the
interesting piece:
If Jesus was a man
who had recently lived,
nobody said to Paul.
Paul had never heard
for Mary, Joseph
the Bethlehem, Herod,
John the Baptist,
had never heard of a
of miracles,
says nothing of what
supposed that Jesus said.
It says that Jesus
was a kind lot.
No one knows
entrance to Jerusalem,
It mentions Pontius Pilate,
the Jewish mob, or a trial.
Paul does not know anything of this
we call the "life of Jesus"
apart from these three
recent events.
And even these, Paul never
it places on earth.
Like other rescuers
gods of history,
Christ of Paul,
Jesus, died, resurrected
and taken all the
mythological way.
"If Jesus
was on earth
would
not even a priest. "(Hebrews 8:4 to)
Paul does not believe that
Jesus was once human.
Neither man knew the idea.
And this is the link between
gap from the assumed life of Jesus
and the appearance of the first
gospel to life.
So do not listen to
Christian leaders
to talk about the early years
of Christianity.
Why only compounds the facts,
the story is that
Jesus lived,
all the forgotten,
and then remembered.
But is even
more subversive.
The allegorical literature was
particularly common at the time.
RICHARD CARRIER HISTORICAL Perhaps Paul
himself does not believed that he wrote history.
He wrote a symbolic message
he wrote a gospel,
"good news".
They symbolize using
Biblical parallels
parallels by
paganistikes religions, etc.
There are other gospels

similar myths developed
ROBERT M. PRICE

speak for him.
You can not rewrite history
without Caesar August.
But for Jesus, it seems to
2 points are incorrect history.
The stories are either
even mythological,
as the slaughter of infants, made
from the book of output
whether they contain extravagant avasimotites,
as the Jewish supreme council
to convene the Easter period
to get rid of Jesus.
Just exclude it.
Or Pontius Pilate to release
a notorious murderer Roman,
if they chose the Varavva
and letting Jesus in the mob,
once tried to escape,
needed if no opinion.
All this proves the
historical avasimotita.
And when you realize that there were
Ancient Jewish Christians
who believed that Jesus had
died a century ago,
the reign of Alexander,
or the Gospel of Peter says
that Herod killed Jesus.
How can such
divergence,
if recent events were
that people remember?
Makes you wonder: Was this
real part of human history?
Or actually looks like someone is trying to
introduce a personality
mythological initially in book
history, with various additions;
Can you give an example
a history that began as a fantastic

There are many other

The Mithras, the Attis, the Adonis,
the Osiris, the Tamouz, and
many others
Nobody believes that these
figures are not mythological.
and their stories are so
common, most
have some sort of resurrection,
sometimes Celebrations

And seems to blind
when we say that:
"in the case of Jesus
All this happened in real life. "
"When we say that Jesus Christ

For thousands of years
mankind was

It is no coincidence that the story
the Crucifixion of Jesus

Of course, Christians today

The passions of Christ

Have you noticed how bad
reputation is the inquisition?
Until Christians today
find that it was a bad idea.
But how can
a bad idea?
If the Bible is right,
is not to sacrifice
absolute faith?
Although some pain here on earth
save all the souls
for all eternity,
is not good?
The inquisition was not a
"diversion" of Christians.
The inquisition was a
"expression" of Christians.
I am curious, how when
have a Protestant prayer,
a Catholic prayer
and a Jewish prayer.
With all respect for them
the "good people"
my friends, the almighty God,
not hear the prayers of Jews.
Why is that good, to God

I really do not.
The anarpagi described in the paper
to Thessalonians, Chapter 416-17.
SCOTT BUTCHER

When Jesus will return to earth to
take the church in heaven.
And when we say the church
believers, not the buildings.
22% of Americans say that
is confident that Jesus will return,
to determine live
and dead
somewhere within the
next 50 years.
Another 22% say
that is likely to return.
This is 44% of voters
is convinced
that Jesus will return
during their lifetime.
Personally, I think it will happen
during my life.
I am 47 years old,
normal life.
So it is within the
next 20 to 30 years.
If we analyze that leads
this belief,
is the perfect deception
the future of humanity.
"I believe HOW THE BIBLE IS THE
ALATHITOS, MONADIKOS SPEECH OF GOD "
It is misleading, particularly
when we must avoid
a global conflict, because according
the prophecies, the war is
The omens of the return of Jesus.
Listening to various
Bible scholars,
to say that what is happening
today in the world
almost all have been as
says the paper needs to be done
before returning the
Jesus Christ.
As long as all are
become the world
has reached the end.
Any time.
Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say
that a significant proportion

and saw a mushroom tobacco

Before 6 years, I am
by divine inspiration
I made a web page,
"Raptureletters. com".
This website is for
people have spoken
their relatives and loved ones
for the kingdom of heaven
and were not the answer
who wanted
or not satisfied
for these things.
Thus, they can go to my page
write your name and e-mail them
and will receive a message
after anarpagi.
The message I hope to
offers some solace
recipients and their
informed that their loved ones
is in heaven now
and also contains a message
with a prayer to be saved
and go and the same
in paradise.
At present,
such people

and also can eklechthoun
as presidents and senators
is an extremely
dangerous turn of events.
Have someone
makes a false statement
or altering texts
altering data,
and put on a website,
or in a book
someone from the world
faces as a remarkable editor.
And after hundreds of thousands of Christians
read and think,
why assume that "I would lie
This is not something that will epinoouse.
And repeat, and watch
to repeat a lie below
mainly by people
not tell lies,
truly believe that it is
true, just not the searched.
In the book "101 Prophecies

some of the things
to be made:
"The Babylon, known as Babel

And Saddam Hussein spent

Basically, I think it

it stops the conversation.
It can cause

When the chairman of
United States says:
"Aim at a point
common sense
we know that is true,
it comes from God "
I think someone in the White House
should be answered:
"What's different is that,
by saying
that aims at a
common sense
which stems from Jupiter? "
It is an inappropriate question,
but it is a reasonable question.
Unfortunately, says the paper, we
have a great group of people
will go on
paradise after anarpagi,
and 144 thousand
Virgin Jews.
The crowd will be wearing white robes, the
says in the book of Revelation,
and the number will be
"impossible to measure. "
But these people
will be killed.
Most will lose
head of the faith.
So it is much better to
accept Jesus as your savior now
and to take the
anarpagi,
rather than wait for post and
must lose your head
or something.
You know something?
Something like the Scott.
Him.
It is a good man,
is a productive
member of society,
is author
job,
support his wife
and children.
It is crazy.
At least, I hope
is not.
Why I thought the same
things that Scott believes.
The ANARPAGI
EISAl ETOIMOS?
Yes, I fundamentalists
Christian.
I learned the doctrine
in my school
the Village christian, in
Sun Valley, California.
The symbol of our school
was a crusader;
as the "mission" we
was to fight
in a holy war.
But not only
in a holy war.
We knew that Satan has done his work
through other Christian publications
and should be
and fight them.
In the chapel every Friday,
We learned that the only way
for salvation is to develop
a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
And every week we had a
opportunity to accept Jesus
like our savior.
What is salvation?
It is the opposite of condemnation.
I think the hell mathane
is a real part,
where the truth
go if not to forgive
Jesus Christ.
When the school said it would encourage
each student to develop
a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ
This meant the
"encouragement".
Forgive or condemn.
But Jesus was a good man!
I forgive for everything:
Lie, murder,
pornography on the Internet
anything.
I will forgive even if
talk at the same Jesus.
But, apparently to be
a little more interesting
Jesus added
an additional rule.
There is a real
unforgivable sin:
to renounce the Holy Spirit.
If you do this,
you are doomed forever.
It says in the Bible, 2 times.
It is a clear,
infallible rule
Renouncing the Holy Spirit and will not go
elsewhere, only in hell.
And coincidentally, the Holy Spirit is
the most easily challenged:
God does not touch, Jesus
was 2000 years ago
But the Holy Spirit is
precisely here, at this time.
So better to start
feel the Holy Spirit.
You can not deny the mind
you, because Jesus is in your mind
And if you start to think that there are
so evidence for the existence of
those for the unicorn,
Guess what you do:
The biggest crime in
fundamentalist Christianity
is to think.
Disputed = DEATH
And when I was such a
Christian, I was terrified
which is wrong, did.
Fortunately, I had a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ
and antimilisa
for these things
and operation of
Friday I did often.
I asked Jesus if
would condone
although I doubt
the existence of the Holy Spirit.
Of course, I could not know
if you will forgive.
As far as I know, I have now stopped
believe in such things whack.
But often I wonder,
if there are children in this school
to pass the same difficulties
I passed.
And also I wonder how
intelligent, affectionate
obviously busy people
run by the Village Christian
can teach children
these false, terrible ideas
of how the world;
So I went back to school
the Village Christian
to speak to the person responsible for
teach children what and why.
What you say is that
teach the basic principles
Christian doctrine
all students?
The position we have is as follows:
DR. RONALD SIPUS
Supervisor-school Village Christians
Those who would teach,
are,
which are necessary
for salvation.
In conclusion: who you think is
Jesus and what do about it?
For everything else will speak, and
there is much interesting to say
which helps to understand
some things.
But what makes
the difference is:
Who believe that Jesus is,
that is heading with it?
So in that specialize.
They spend the school year.
If we do anything else,
intellectual reasons
we want children
to understand that we
to develop a personal
relationship with Jesus Christ.
Then find a way
gis feasible to do so.
Religion is a
area where we are
lessons, not
open to criticism.
To deny that
Holocaust happened
or claims that you
in dialogue with aliens
in our culture is almost
synonymous with insanity.
And so, because the challenge
people, when they believe strongly
things without evidence
in contrast with a mountain
evidence.
Apart from the issue of faith.
In manual, there is
a statement of faith
and 7 points: "We
the paper as the inspired,
infallible
single word of God. "
"We believe in one God, eternally
ternary:
Father, Son and Holy Spirit. "
"We believe in the resurrection of those who
have been saved and the condemned.
or how to save the
resurrection life
whether that will be lost in
resurrection of condemnation. "
Tell me, what scientific evidence
you have to prove
how the world works right?
Well, the mistake many make
Christians are trying to
to convince people that
what they believe spiritually
can be demonstrated.
First of all, there are many
historical evidence that Jesus
he was saying it was.
There are many historical figures
evidence of the resurrection.
If you are looking for historical
science
to show that there was
and again,
there is evidence
shows this.
But the question is
that is a matter of faith.
If you want to get a medical degree
and have a lot of ideas
to human health not
may rely on evidence
and talk about personal
Your strong beliefs
you can not
argue,
will not get a diploma,
but will become and derision.
That is correct,
because lives depend from it.
I have never seen God? No.
You have seen you? No.
How I know this is true?
How do I know what they say
the scriptures are true?
Can be hard to prove
evidence that is true? No.
It is a matter of faith.
Have you ever thought that it is wrong
1800 to teach students
that the world works so
without any evidence for this?
You think that is
the height of irresponsibility
to do?
Absolutely not.
The culmination of irresponsibility will
was to ignore the truth of God,
to ignore the reality
of Jesus Christ.
Used the word
"reality".
- Before you said that no
solid evidence.
- That there are now?
- No, I do not now exist. "
One minute before I said that
there is compelling evidence
demonstrating
existence of Jesus.
That was true.
I speak for the functioning of the world.
You said that is a matter of faith
how the world works. How
must fill in the Holy Spirit,
that there will be a resurrection, etc. All
they said that is a matter of faith.
Yes, it is faith. It is faith.
As long as faith is and you are
faithful, how you feel to teach
an ignorant child that the world
actually work like that?
I have no problem with it,
why we say to young children:
"What we believe
is the truth. "
And every man is
responsible for the beliefs.
Fine, you think that
this declaration of faith,
To add an 8th rule.
Incidentally: "Can not do
and wrong
and you are free
to look out for you?
No, I would put it in the declaration
faith, but we say to all children
coming here "This is something
that we must believe. "
There are children coming to school
and we do not believe in Christianity.
And we say: "It is in order. "
That's okay, believe what you want.
Now write a statement
demonstrate
that you believe is right. "
So wait
of these students
to demonstrate how the world works
according to their own beliefs?
The remaining students
mainly taught
we must believe that
the supernatural world works?
There "must" to believe anything.
What we say is:
"is what the Bible says.
Our basis is the Bible. "
And the person has to decide,
if what the Bible says
is truth or lies.
But the Bible is symbolic
literature before the 1st century.
Really, you think is good
concept learning in children
that something is true?
Well, accurate performance,
set an example:
"God created
the world in 7 days ".
That means 7 days
24 hours?
Or it means that one day
is one million years?
What does this mean?
There are different views
in itself
Christian community.
Indeed, I speak for a
specific things.
In the manual says: "The main
purpose of school
is to encourage student
to accept Jesus Christ... "
We can stop
a minute?
- ... As the savior of their lives. "
- Can you stop a moment?
- Why?
- I want to ask off camera.
Why outside? Will respond.
Here I am.
You can ask
anything.
That for which you wish to speak
and my mathane this school
is that you will be eternally sentenced
certain, though deny the Holy Spirit.
Brian, you know what you did?
You were disingenuous
for this interview.
Why cheap?
I sent an e-mail...
Yes. Spent the last 5-7 minutes
trying to feel better
for those who feel
how punished here.
You talk to them, which
that we will talk.
We said we would talk about
education of children.
Interrupt the interview?
Yes.
Why do this?
Well.
The Dr. Sipus did not want to speak
the camera to write anymore.
And so there was no reason to stay.
But as Leave, noticed
that the chapel was open.
This is the chapel, where
I accepted Jesus Christ
as my personal savior.
Just sat there, in that
pew when I did.
It sat there, and
I did it again.
And later, sat back
and did it again.
Xanagennithika at least
three times.
Sit down to get the camera too.
Here in this chapel
where the first accepted Jesus
as my personal savior
I want to say one thing:
"Renounce the Holy Spirit. "
I am not afraid
INTERVIEWS
(in alphabetical order)
I have said before,
that airlines
not allow two Christians
to fly together
if one
both suddenly disappear.
In other words, there is a choice,
be a Jew, a Christian?
Frankly, I do not know if this
is mandatory or reputation.
I have just heard that a couple
times over the last 10 years.
- We have the cross.
- No, I have not cross.
Listen to a case:
Die
conclusively dead,
  - I do not speak
for the various offices Anastassis
that Jesus is working -
and discover
how the hell are you,
and bake in grills and every hour
must lick the bird sichameno
of Satan and all those
is really bad, yes?
I would wish to believe?
It's easy, just believe.
No, it will become
better things
If I had to sit in paradise
knowing that millions
or even billions of people,
frichta suffer eternal torture
and can not do
something about them.
That would be hell for me.
There is a joke
that the pope dies,
go to heaven, St. Peter
the host, as usual
and says: "He had a holy
life on earth.
If there is anything you want,
I'm happy to give you the.
Anything! "
And the Pope answered:
"Well, I have never seen
the original version of the Bible. "
Take him to a domatiaki there
in a table, the original paper.
Pope opens the
and shortly after saying:
"Oh my God! The word is
"Celebration!"
When my thesis about Jesus issued
was received a few letters wrong.
Mainly by people
who prays to sotho.
You can
to do "sotho.
Any chance?
No.
I am happy as I am.
I am happy with my life.
Because of taboos,
not to criticize the faith
and all the beliefs that
has produced a religious faith,
have the prospect of
trained civil colleges
to show their social
policy.
For example, to prevent
research
for IVF,
not based on evidence
based on metaphysical prejudices.
In this case, based on
doctrine that the soul enters the zygote
the moment of conception.
And that leads people
should know better
to take the floor in
Congress, or the oval office
and saying the plateiasmous
first century,
who allegedly used
as moral arguments against
what is undoubtedly the most
promising research in biology
to help tackle
terrible diseases.
Someone found a parody
a social message
of disabled children:
"Be my friend" or "send money"
for a kid in Billy, which
supposed
I removed the body and
replaced
with a bag full of leaves.
"Please send
money or an e-mail ".
And receive messages from
people who asked:
"Is it true?" It is true,
that the boy had only a head
"adjusted in a bag
full of leaves? "
"And if you need new sheets?"
Around 11 years my
I became a Baptist fundamentalist,
and I came in different
youth programs.
I will be always grateful to the church
I developed my
curiosity in the paper.
Finally a few years later,
during a
theological seminar
I understand that you can
Paper face realistically
if you think that the paper is
inspired a book without errors.
It is like being blind, is so
many things that make no sense.
Finally I decided, as he
and Mircea Eliade:
"The west must often be
aside faith
in exchange for the truth. "
Knowledge is more important. Weighing
things for many years.
And now I go to church,
go to a Episcopal church.
I like what is happening there.
The symbols and literature
precisely because they know
that all of this is mythology.
It really is a matter of faith.
People say:
"What is the difference
Evolution as fact
and Creation as fact?
The truth is that nothing
Both are not true,
because you can not simulations
either.
You can see signs
evolution between species,
but can not be
look at different species.
Science is not
fault-free evolution.
The establishment has many proofs.
Scientific evidence.
The evolving science,
so we see it
accurate creation.
However, I personally believe in
Jesus Christ, is a matter of faith.
