Ready to see you now.
[Jacob clears throat]
[Jacob speaking Korean]
[Doctor, in English]
Okay, see,
this is where blood flows out,
like a door.
Open, close, open, close.
You see how close
the hole is here?
Now this is why the California
doctor wanted to wait
till he's a bit older
before surgery.
But, and are you ready?
It looks like the hole
is getting smaller.
- What?
- It's still there,
but in comparing measurements,
it's a significant
improvement.
All right, this means
we can rule out surgery,
and we can see if the hole
closes up on its own.
This is very good news.
But sound has
gotten louder.
[Doctor] Yes. Sometimes,
as the hole gets smaller,
the sound gets louder.
Loud is good.
Are we happy?
Yes, I'm happy.
Thank you.
