A giant male.
He weighs at least 750 kilo.
Look.
An hour, hour-and-a-half.
We are below wind now.
Why did you shoot ?
- It had to be quick.
Should have waited for me.
His left shoulder is hit.
He was spinning on his front-legs.
A wounded bear retreats.
If you would have hit at least a
back-leg ... We can forget it.
Nah.
Won't see him anymore.
Even with your binoculars.
Forget it, man.
He is long gone.
Believe me.
Easy now.
Easy.
Come up.
I will get you.
When I'm lucky,
I'm back before your foot heals.
With the dogs there
the fun really starts.
Dixie ?
Come here.
Come, beautiful dog.
Come here.
Whos dog are you ?
Here.
There he is.
No, too far away.
You will hit the dogs.
Gotcha.
He does not like it.
What a bad little bear.
What is that ?
Big, hé ? It's a 'horse'.
Tom.
This way. Come, dogs.
Easy.
Hush. Stay.
Come here.
Now be quiet. Hush.
Hush. Lay down.
Lay down.
Hé, look at that.
Forget him.
Let's go on.
Nice, hé ?
Get up. It's time.
No, first stand up.
Sit up.
Look at him. Nice, hé ?
Sit up.
And stand en sit up.
That's a nice place to lock him up.
Did Joseph muzzle the dogs ?
- Yes, he's waiting by the river.
We're here.
You take position there,
I'll take the other side.
He has to pass here.
But stay on your spot.
Sure thing.
I won't move a muscle.
Damn.
Please, let me live.
Please.
Get away.
Go.
They can't see you.
Bulls-eye, he fell like a rock
in the ravine.
Ok, boy ...
You are free.
How long have we known, son ?
Three months ?
Five.
I never ask people questions.
Everybody has his secrets.
Supposed to be like that.
He found the taste
for the real world.
Get away.
Good luck.
' The greatest thrill
is not to kill ...
... but to let live.'
