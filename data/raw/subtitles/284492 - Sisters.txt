Natasha, Alik,
are you back?
Alik, my heartfelt
congratulations on your return.
Calm down,
no one's back yet.
- Will they be much longer?
- I don't know.
When are you coming back?
Whenever they arrive,
I'll come back.
- You won't stay for a while?
- As if I would!
in a Sergei BODROVfilm
- Stay for a bit.
- Absolutely no way.

Mum, I need to go

For heavens sake!
Can't you sit still?
Not long now.
They are signing someone out,
and Alik is next.

Sergei SELYANOV
- What's this then?
- It's from a cold.
- Alik! Hello!
- Hi.
- Congratulations on getting out.
- The same to you.
Can we talk for a moment?
Alik, the question
of the money's come up.
Kostya's asking.
The cops took the money.
Ask them.
They say they didn't tale it.
And?
And we need to get it back.
Come on, Dad,
I need to go to the toilet.
The meat's probably
dried right out.
You are not supposed
to cook it for three hours.
We were waiting so long!
I'm worn out.
Well, get used to it.
It won't be the last time.
Hello, Uncle Misha.
Don't touch!
Mum, what's she giving
orders for?
Don't pick.
Go sit at the table.
I'll bring everything in.
- How's grandma?
- Fine. Give her a call.
- Have you boiled the beetroot?
- Yes.
- And I've done some ironing for you.
- I'd have done it myself.
You can iron your husband's
shirts yourself.
I haven't touched them.
I am already like Cinderella
round here.
Cut it out and
take the fish in.
- Hi there.
Hello.
Off already? Have you
taken the chicken?
Here is some money
for grandma.
- Thanks. You'll phone, right?
- I'll phone tomorrow.
Can you pick Dina up
from schooI tomorrow?
No, I've got training.
You can pick her up
from music then.
Bye.
Come, on, Sveta, he is not
such a bad man.
After all, he helps you with the
shopping and gives you money.
Stolen money. They don't
lock up good men.
Nowadays they do.
Someone tells tales.
After all, they let him
out almost straight away.
Paid someone some money
- got let out.
Anyway, let me listen.
Don't take too long.
Sveta, hey Sveta!
Shall we go to the pictures?
I've already seen everything
that's on.
Maybe to a cafe, then?
- What, you've got some money then?
- Yes.
Probably stole it
from your parents.
No, I earned it at camp!
- Are we going to a cafe then?
- What for?
Well, people go out to places,
don't they?
People do a lot of stupid
things, don't they?
How romantic!
Isn't it about time you
got married, Malinina?
Klimkin, have you got any goaI
in your life?
Well, I'd like to go
and live in Germany.
They treat Jews OKthere.
- And you?
- I'll go to Chechnya, as a sniper.
- How?
- On a contract.
On whose side?
On our side, of course.
Not for the Chechens!
Could you really shoot
someone then?
If I had to I could.
Sveta, I wanted to ask you.
Your Dad's a Chechen, isn't he?
Is he from Chechnya?
Listen. Firstly, he is not my Dad.
That's first.
Secondly, he's from Daghestan,
and that's a big difference.
- Mum, can't he buy you a dishwasher?
- What for?
- Why waste the money?
- You're right.
It's so hard getting
the money in the first place.
Oh, come on, really.
Don't forget to pick
the kid up from music.
Don't worry, I am not going
to forget about your kid.
- You asleep?
- No.
- What's up?
- Not much.
Maybe Dina should start going
to some club, too?
Wouldn't hurt. Otherwise she'll
grow up a pansy weakling.
You're exaggerating,
she plays the violin,
goes to her teacher, draws.
Have you seen her drawings?
She'll need to go
to an analyst soon.
Can you light me a cigarette?
My nails are wet.
And give me an ashtray.
He promised we'd go skiing
in Austria.
Just don't break
your neck there.
I don't want to be left
looking after your kid.
No, I think we're all going.
Do you love him, mum?
Yes.
Why?
He's my husband.
Who was Dad then?
Just tell yourself
you never had a dad.
So, my place has been taken?
Yes, Alik, that's what
was decided.
You've still got to give
the cash back though.
How much do they say
was there?
Today, one million.
Give it back today,
and your place is free.
One million?
I want my place freed up today.
Dad!
- Go in.
- OK.
Everything OK?
There were two of them hanging
around the music schooI.
- Who were they?
- Kostya's men, in a Pajero.
Right, stay here.
Don't touch the blinds.
Don't use the phone.
Got it?
- There's food there.
- But I've got training tomorrow.
Don't worry.
I'll train you myself later.
- I'm not staying here with her.
- You'll stay and you'll behave.
Something smells here.
- Alik, I'll stay with them.
- You are coming with me.
Everything's to look normaI.
Kids're at their relatives.
We're at home.
You're right, there's
some sort of smell.
Dina, you do what Sveta says,
and I'll come tomorrow.
And you be in bed by nine.
The fish has gone off.
What if the owners come back?
Don't worry, they won't be back.
The owner died recently.
- Why've you painted yourself up?
- I like it.
- Where did you get the lipstick?
- From the bathroom.
Go and wash it off.
I think we were told
not to use the phone.
Can you keep quiet?
Grandma? Hi, it's me.
I'm staying at the Klimkins' dacha.
I'll be back tomorrow.
Don't worry about me.
Have you taken your medicine?
Alright then, bye.
Don't you know that Iying
is wrong?
Who told you that?
My Dad.
And did he tell you why
they want to kidnap you?
They steaI a lot of kids
nowadays.
Better if they'd kidnapped you.
Then I wouldn't be stuck here.
At some dead guy's apartment.
You only listen to your Tsoi.
He must have died
a hundred years ago.
Firstly, he was killed.
Because of someone like you.
Some stupid girI jumped out
into the road.
He crashed to avoid her.
Hi. You promised you'd phone.
I don't know if I should
come round or not. Call me.
This is from the car service.
We've changed the filters
last Tuesday.
Tell us when we can deliver
the car. Goodbye.
Dima, it's Mum. Please, ring.
Grandma's been taken
to the hospitaI.
- Do you want a banana?
- Alright.
Give me for bread!
- Where're your parents?
- Got no parents.
You parents probably
force you to beg?
- Where're your mum and dad?
- In prison.
Give me for bread!
Here's some bread.
Bitch!
I tell you, they are not hungry.
They don't take bread.
They just want money!
I always do that - I check.
Hot pies! Meat or potato pies.
Pies anyone?
Let's have a pie!
- Young man, are they fresh?
- Very fresh.
- Two meat pies then.
- 12 rubles.
- How much?
- Potato are five, meat are six.
- What do you want?
- Potato.
Thank you.
- Did you phone Dad?
- Who else?
- Where are we going?
- Mum's relatives live here.
- Do they know we are coming?
- Mum probably phoned them.
Hello, are your parents home?
Mum! Sveta's here.
Natasha's daughter!
With the other daughter!
Hello, Auntie Zoya.
Hello.
Auntie Zoya, this is Dina.
Can we stay
with you for a day?
Valera!
Didn't Mum phone you?
What?
Hello, Uncle Valera.
Hello.
Hi.
- Natasha's?
- Yes.
Get in the house,
sharpish!
Some sort of trouble?
They were supposed
to pick us up.
We need to phone them,
to tell them we are here.
Natasha called, but Sveta,
you have to understand.
Understand me, I've got
two kids to look after.
If you need something, OK.
But just as long as we won't
have any trouble afterwards.
Oh, we'll be off then.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
We don't smoke here, Alik.
What've you come for?
Have you brought the money?
Kostya, just tell me one thing.
Do you believe me or the cops?
I believe that someone's
got to pay.
If you want to listen, listen.
I didn't take the money.
I swear on my kid's life!
And it's not you that's
asking me for it!
I came to you myself, Kostya.
We are not children.
Leave the kid alone.
I won't run from you.
It's not you I need.
I need the money.
And your kid now costs
two million.
- I'm hungry.
- I haven't eaten anything either.
You can buy ice cream
over there.
I've only got
three rubles left.
just enough for
a telephone token.
Maybe we could ask someone.
- What?
- Well, for money, or bread.
You want to start begging
on trains?
We could sing. And people
will give us money.
Sing if you've got
the bareface cheek.
Just be carefuI they don't
put you in a nuthouse.
Let's go.
Pies!
Stand back.
Hey, what about me?
Where are the owners?
Are they dead?
No, they are alive
for the time being.
Who lives here?
Leave me alone! What difference
does it make to you?
I am sick of chasing round
strange houses with you.
Don't you understand why are we hiding?
Want me to explain?
It's because your dad's
a gangster.
And you're a gangster's
daughter.
Liar! Liar!
He's not a gangster!
A gangster. A reaI gangster.
And a thief.
Got it. And then
where did they go?
No one knows?
Have a look on that line.
CarefuI how you tip off
the police.
They were in Kurovskaya.
They dropped
in on some relatives.
They wouldn't let them in.
What do you expect?
People are afraid.
It's only you
that's never afraid.
Find them that money!
It's too late
to find the money.
Now we have
to find the children.
Tomorrow I'll find them myself
and we'll get out of here.
Don't pick it up.
Can I try again?
This phone is for work.
Please.
Tanya, it's me again.
Where was that call from?
Tanya, have a look and see
where it is.
Revyakava. OK, thanks.
Hi, Klimkin, it's me.
Lyosha, something's up.
I need some money.
A lot.
However much you've got.
When can you give it to me?
Come afterwards then.
I'm at your dacha.
You've forgotten where
your dacha is?
Zelenovod village, number 15.
And bring something to eat.
Dina!
Dina!
Dina!
Idiot! I've got my
make-me-invisible hat on.
What're you shouting for?
Idiot!
If you want we can
go out somewhere?
Alright.
What sort of dance is that?
It's a belly dance.
I'm getting sick
from the height.
So? Me too.
Will we be spinning round
much longer?
UntiI we are really sick.
Have you ever kissed
with anyone?
As if!
Well, have you got
a boyfriend?
There is one.
- And?
- Nothing.
They are just kids at that age.
The old man scared them.
They were waiting for someone.
They hit the old man and
burnt the house down.
First time I have ever
seen them here.
Aforeign-make car.
A Pajero.
- What happened?
- Afire.
Listen, Lyosha,you see,
they want to kidnap her.
- Chechens?
- I don't know.
What've Chechens got to do with it?
We have to get out of here.
This is for you.
Did you bring the money?
You see, I was offered
this CD-ROM.
A new one. So I've only got
ten rubles left.
- Why did you come then?
- Well, we agreed.
You'll probably catch it
from your parents now.
No. You mixed up the dachas.
We're at Number 17.
That's ours over there.
Why are you two smiling like idiots?
My hat's just gone up in flames.
What are we going to do now?
We could go to the police and
try telling them everything.
I don't think we should go
to the police.
They might put dad
back to prison.
Get in.
What're you waiting for?
I'm not going.
- What can they do to us?
- Maybe nothing to you.
- Hello.
- Hello.
We came on an excursion
and got lost.
It's easy to get lost.
I've got to phone my parents.
- Do you know where there's a phone?
- Not far. Get in.
Go and eat.
Can I make a phone call?
The lamp's burnt out.
You'll be walking along
at night
and suddenly -
the lights go out!
You'll think you've been
wiped out.
- How old are you?
- Thirteen.
- Do you want to work?
- I don't know. Doing what?
What can you do?
She can shoot.
Your sister?
Yes.
I can play the violin.
And sing.
Good.
Come on, stand up.
Come here.
Where are you from?
From town. We got left
behind our tour group.
Easy now, honey!
- Do you have flees?
- Don't touch!
I'll tell my dad you
touched me!
My dad's a gangster.
He's called Alik Meshersky.
And this is my sister.
To the market!
I play on a two-quarter size.
You mean you can't play
the violin?
This is a full-size,
for grown-ups.
You have to play
for grown-ups.
What, like an idiot?
It won't come out right!
Doesn't have to sound right.
Has to sound pitifuI.
15 rubles a bottle.
We get a ruble for each one.
What am I supposed to trundle
about on the trains with them?
They sell well at the market
as well.
Hey, darling!
What's this place called?
Kurovskaya station.
Have you got any beer?
Cola, Pepsi, Sprite.
Listen, get us some beer,
would you?
Hey, have you people got
any gangsters round here?
Bring it over, alright?
Again? I can't believe it!
- Have these guns been sighted?
- Of course. Of course, always.
Roma doesn't need sighted guns!
Come on!
Missed again!
- Who's next then?
- No way.
Can I?
Alright. What're you betting?
- What do you mean?
- We are playing for money.
Bet your box.
It's not mine.
You can lose someone
else's stuff.
Well done, darling.
- How was the gun?
- Nothing speciaI.
You get that, darky?
Will you be my bodyguard?
- Alright.
- It's a deaI.
You grow up a bit, and I'll take
you out of here. To Moscow.
No scum bothering you
round here, is there?
If someone touches you,
just tell me.
- Want one?
- We've got some money of our own.
We'll wait here.
- Are the police looking for you?
- Yes.
Wait here.
What's he giving orders for?
What about the money?
We're not prostitutes,
we just got lost.
We are on a schooI trip.

Well, go and ring.
We've found the children,
Murtazaeva and Malakhova.
Yes, there're here.
Pick them up at the Oktyabrsky
police department.
Next time we'll put you
in the cells, got that?
- Pavlovich, should I take them over?
- Stay here.
Let's go.
- Hello.
- Hello, Dina.
- Yours?
- Yes, thank you.
It's them.
Please, don't hand us over.
They want to kidnap her.
Her dad's a gangster -
it's because of him.
They might kill.
They are all gangsters.
Let's go!
- Hang on a second.
- Get out.
Drop it.
What the hell! I said drop it!
Are you nuts?
Seifullin, where are you?
Why're you always hiding?
Didn't hear, didn't hear.
I fell asleep in the barn.
The dog woke me up.
I'll lock you up.
You try hiding one more time.
Hide? What for?
I've been working all day.
Sober as a judge.
You should put something cold
on it, like ice cream
Alexander Pavlovich!
Some tea perhaps?
Mister, have you got
anything cold?
I see.
Will this do? Be my guest.
Mister, maybe we should
take her to a doctor?
Misters traveI on the metro
with briefcases.
Stay here and don't
make a move.
Thank you.
Sniper!
So, your dad's a gangster?
Seifullin, be carefuI with them.
Can you take me
to the village?
Get off!
I need to buy a newspaper.
Do you think they'll
pick us up soon?
They should do.
I already want to go home.
I know.
Sveta, maybe they've gone
somewhere?
What if we spend all our lives
wandering around like this.
We'll just ask that nice
policeman and he'll find them.
- And if he doesn't?
- He'll find them.
He is a policeman, after all.
So you think all policemen
are nice?
I don't get mixed up with them,
so they leave me alone.
I've noticed.
Why has he taken us in then?
For money, most likely.
To get money from your dad.
I know my dad's a gangster.
But he loves me.
We're going skiing in Austria.
Your dad dumped you though.
We don't know who
has dumped who yet.
- What's wrong?
- My head hurts.
You've got a temperature.
Get some sleep.
Eat a little.
Where did you get
the lipstick?
Where did you get
the lipstick?
In the apartment where we hid
the first night.
- You mean you stole it?
- Yes.
What a family!
What are you going to be,
Sveta, when you grow up?
I don't know.
I could become a bodyguard.
My dream is we grow up and
become performers, together.
We'll dance the belly dance!
Who are you?
She's got sick.
Get out!
I'm the boss here!
She is sick.
Don't touch!
It's mine!
I'll phone the police!
They told you to stay put
and not to make a move!
I'm not afraid of cops
Go and sleep in your barn!
Is there a chemist's
around here?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Where is Sveta?
- She is sick.
Her nerves probably.
- Has dad phoned you?
- No.
If he phones, tell him
we're living here
with an old man, not Russian,
near the dam.
Aspirin, please,
and something for nerves.
You didn't notice it?
Where's the kid?
I don't know.
How much did Alik
promise you? Tell the truth?
He's greedy!
I'll give you double.
Stubborn cop. Why are you
so stubborn?
Already got loads of money?
Or bags of health?
Where's the kid?
Where's the kid?
Where's the kid?
It was a two! Two!
Allah sees all!
It was a four!
- Sveta, he's Iying! Cheat!
- I am a cheat?
I'll tell
Alexander Pavlovich!
He already knows everything -
I'm an honest man.
You're a rotten cheat!
Let's play on.
- Hello?
- It's Alik.
- Well?
- Tell Kostya I'm in place.
- Have you brought it all?
- Yes, we have.
We are on our way.
Sveta, what are you going
to do afterwards?
After what?
Well, when you get home?
Keep training. And you?
Maybe I'll go somewhere.
- Let's go together?
- Where to?
India if you want.
We'll earn some money.
And go, together.
They take in difficult children
in Tibetan monasteries there.
Firstly, that's in China.
Run! Run for it!
Daddy!
Be carefuI, there's glass in there.
Be carefuI on those skis.
I can't be thinking
about skis.
I've got to by everything,
furniture, everything.
- Have they finished the repairs?
- They said so.
I'll have to double check.
Though it is Europe,
it's the same old story.
What about a schooI?
Mum, they've got schools
there too, don't worry!
Have you put any food in?
10 kilograms,
enough for the trip.
- Where's Sveta?
- She's coming.
Well, this is it.
Sveta!
We are off!
Are you coming out?
Sveta...
- So, good luck.
- Bye.
Are you coming with us?
No.
Here you go.
Sveta, will we see
each other again?
Yes.
Well, off to your training
or you'll be late.
I haven't got
any training today.
