Hi.
Hi.
Congratulations.
For what?
- you are the lucky winner...
of our Beauty on the Road contest.
And our company offers you
a one-night-stay in Goa.
A one-night stay in Goa
and dinner and...
...cocktail with a
great personality.
Really? who is that
great personality?
Me, of course.
Our company offers you
my company tonight.
Trust me, you won't wish
for the night to end.
Shall we go on a long drive?
I'm going to Hollywood Casino.
wow. what a coincidence!
I was also going there...
just have to take a u-turn.
By the way, what's the name of
the company that has chosen me?
This great company is Rocky.
9820420420.
I see. Double 420?
- Double fun.
And you?
- Simran.
wow! Lovely name.
It's the first time I
hear such a sexy name.
Is your father a terrorist?
- what...?
who else can make such a sexbomb?
So where do we start, Simran? I mean,
from there? Or from the casino?
Sorry, I can neither have a drink,
nor can I gamble here.
why not?
- Because I'm not allowed to.
I joined only yesterday.
I'm a dancer.
Great. we'll meet after duty hours.
My duty ends at 3 am.
My day starts at 3 am.
I'll wait for you right here.
Congratulations.
you are the lucky winner of the
Beauty on the Road contest.
Rosy...?
- Rocky...
how many times will you
give me those lines?
Hey, give this flower
to somebody else.
where have you been all these days?
- I was on vacation.
I mean, I was having fun.
How's Ms Sonia?
She's been upset ever
since that incident.
I can't see a beautiful woman upset.
Lobo, open the door.
Here comes Rocky Romeo again.
Mr Lobo.
what do you want? Come later,
I'm very busy.
I don't want to meet you anyway.
Rocky doesn't have time for men.
I want to see the lady.
Vagabond.
Mrs Beautiful! How are you?
Hey Rocky dear! when did you come?
He came 20 years after you came
into this world. Give it to me.
Go inside.
- Mr Lobo...
Rocky doesn't drive old model cars.
The car may be old, but the
engine is as good as new.
Even this driver can't control
its pickup. Understand?
Is madam up?
- She never sleeps.
Ever since the incident,
she's been sleepless.
She takes sedatives and shuts
her eyes for some time...
...but she doesn't sleep.
where is she now?
- Upstairs.
Having a discussion with the lawyer.
- All right, I'll wait.
I hope all the terms are
clear. Any confusion?
No, ma'am. It'll be done
as per your wish.
But is there any reason
for these sudden changes?
It's personal.
I'll tell you sometime.
Rocky...? How are you?
As usual.
Mrs Lobo, make tea for everyone.
- yes, ma'am.
Any news? Phone call?
No. I don't understand.
It's been so many days
...no news at all.
Don't worry. you've done
no wrong to anyone.
No wrong will be done to you either.
Everything will be fine.
Hello?
Okay, tell me.
I'm indeed a man. you got doubts?
I see.
- who is it?
No idea. He wants to talk to you.
Hello? yes?
yes.
who are you? where are
you calling from?
Please give me your address,
I'll come over.
Don't worry, it'll be organised.
what happened, ma'am?
News about Vicky. He is coming.
See? Rocky is lucky for the ladies.
yes. Today is the happiest
day of my life.
And this calls for a celebration.
I want everyone to rejoice with me.
Tonight's party is not for the
customers of the casino alone...
but for everyone in China
Town. On the house.
"In your love..."
"I'll lose my life"
"Give me your heart

"you are my intoxication"
"you are pining"
"you are my goal"
"In your love..."
"I'll lose my life"
"Every moment, I see..."

"I can't help it..."
"my heart is no more mine"
"you are my Ioneliness"
"you are my gathering"
"you are my yearning"

Hey, he has broken my bottle.

"If I ever get carried away..."

wow! It was amazing.
Sir, I made this show reel
exclusively for you.
wow! I'll certainly include that
song in my current movie.
Only song, sir? won't you
give this hero a chance?
Sure.
Got the money?
what...? why do you come here again
and again and waste my time then?
Please listen to me, sir.
I'm very talented.
I can do action, dance,
horse riding...
Duplicates do all that.
what does the hero do then?
- He brings a million.
I told you, but you didn't get
the money. He brought it.
Sir, I spent all the money
making this show reel.
How can I help it? Get lost.
This enmity will prove
you very costly.
what?
- It'll prove costly for me.
Please cast me in the
hero's role, sir?
Get a million bucks soon, and you'll
play hero number two in this movie.
If you get 1.5 million, I'll kill
that hero before the interval.
Go on, hurry up.
Hey! Listen!
Now what? what dreams I
had when I left Delhi.
And now I'm at the crossroads. The
road to movies isn't opening for me...
and I myself shut down the road
to my house. Daddy did stop me.
Don't stop me today, dad.
Bollywood is calling me.
Bollywood is calling a sucker, not
you. you aren't going to Mumbai.
No power on earth can stop me
from going to Mumbai today.
I'll return only after I
become a superstar, dad.
which means, you'll never return.
you are insulting a future superstar.
Not another minute in this house!
If you step out of this house, the
doors will shut forever for you.
Fie on the door that chokes the
talents of a budding actor.
Are you blind? Can't
you watch and throw?
I'm really sorry. I... - Say sorry
and it's over, eh? Blind bat.
I'm the one who's a blind bat.
Am I not crazy in love
with that fraud Rohit?
But why did you leave home, Priya?
- Rohit...
my daddy wants me to marry some
businessman. Let's get married.
No. Get a couple of millions
from your father.
I'll set up a business.
If luckily it works...
I'll come to seek your hand.
- So...
you will seek my hand only after I
get a couple of millions for you?
yes.
- which one?
This one? Or this one?
why did I have to write a
note when I left the house?
I'll never go back. with
what face do I go back?
Now, I will have to
stay in Mumbai. So what?
I'm an educated, modern girl.
I'll find a job somewhere.
However, I'll have to find a job
that will provide accoModation too.
Difficult. But not impossible.
wanted Personal Secretary.
Timings: 10 pm to 7 am...?
where's your muMy?
you must be hungry, no?
Hang on.
Chocolates.
Now go to your muMy, okay?
Bye.
Sweet baby.
2year old child missing.
It's him!
2.5 million reward!
My problem solved.
Contact Mrs Sonia Chang. 36,
China Town, Panaji, Goa.
where did he go?
you understand my problem.
Thank you, son.
If I become a superstar, you will
play all my kid characters.
Shake hands.
Very good.
Bubbly, you're here?
Sorry. I'm Raj, not Bubbly.
I'm talking to my daughter, not you.
Look, this baby can't
be your daughter.
what nonsense! She is my daughter.
- Hang on.
Forget yours, this baby cannot
be anyone's daughter.
Because this baby is not Bubbly...
he is Bablu.
Proved?
Confusion, as usual. Actually,
I have twins. A boy and a girl.
Come, my dear. Papa
is waiting for you.
Look ma'am, I'm an actor. And it is
my hobby to study people's behaviour.
you aren't wearing a wedding
necklace. It's telling me that...
you are Iying.
- Strange. If he's not my baby...
why would I come to take him?
Do you take me for a kidnapper?
Give me back my baby, or I'll
hand you over to the cops.
I see.
He's a bearer cheQue of 2.5 million!
No wonder you're playing mother.
But now he's going to be my
godfather.
Look, I saw the baby first.
So what? He's in my lap now,
so I have a right to him.
No need to fight. Let's be partners.
I take 90 percent, you take 10.
you think I'm a babysitter? well,
I hate to argue with girls.
I need a million, you can
keep the rest. No problem.
Okay.
- Let's go to the airport.
what? Are we flying?
- I must return with the money fast.
Or the director will make a movie...
...with that hero alone.
you won't understand.
Let's call his mother first.
Hello?
- Hello?
Can I speak to Mrs Sonia Chang?
yes, tell me.
Ma'am, you sound like a man.
I'm a man. Any doubts?
- No.
I'll only talk to Mrs Sonia Chang.
- All right.
who is it?
- No idea. He'll only talk to you.
Hello?
- Hello? Sonia Chang?
yes.
- Is your baby missing?
yes.
- He is with me.
who are you? where are you?
- Mumbai.
Give me the address, I'll come over.
- No, you don't need to worry.
The baby is safe with me. I'm
taking the first flight to Goa.
Mister, not I, we.
- Sorry. we.
we are bringing your baby
by the first flight.
If we could get the reward in cash...
Don't worry, it'll be organised.
- Excellent. Thank you, bye.
How much?
Priya and Raj Enterprises'
first investment.
I hate it when girls spend.
you pay this time, I mean...
you can deduct it from my million.
you didn't tell me
about your family.
9000.
9000? That's one huge family!
- The tickets cost 9000.
you'll pay me 4500.
- Once I become a hero...
I'll give you all of 9000. well,
you have some more?
yes. why?
- Let's have coffee.
Please! I'm Quite bored.
Goa, always.
Honeymoon in Goa, first
anniversary in Goa...
baby's delivery too in Goa,
you even went to Goa...
to iMerse your mother's ashes.
what are you getting at?
- what do you do in Goa anyway?
you lose money all
day in the casino.
I won't let you gamble this time.
- you won't!
This time I'm going there
to win, not to lose.
I have the gambler
god man's formula.
It'll show me the winning number.
No one can stop me from becoming
a millionaire in the casino.
God told me bad times will come.
There will be an extravaganza
at the dance bar...
and the casino will ruin you.
Friend, there's no winning
formula in gambling.
There's a no-Iosing formula though.
what is it?
- Don't gamble.
Stop gambling.
- why fuel the fire?
Do you even know anything
about a casino?
Casino? Friend, if someone
writes my biography...
every chapter will sing praises
only about casinos.
yes. Casino, cards, gambling... when
I hear that, my hands tremble.
I'm the world record holder
of losing in casinos.
My rich father-in-law gave
me five hotels in dowry.
I lost four in casinos.
yes! That's like a man.
Those hotels are pawned at Hollywood
Casino in China Town. Even today.
Ask them.
- Going to lose the last one now?
No. I've stopped gambling.
why?
- Totally stopped.
My rich wife took me to America
and got me treated.
I was given electric shocks
for six months...
so much that words like casino,
cards and.
...gambling were erased from my mind.
I'm clean now.
My wife is not a wife...
Then?
- She's a goddess.
There she is.
For money, you made such
a huge sacrifice.
you're here, Nats darling? I
searched the entire airport for you.
Don't tell me if I put a collar
on you. - No, don't.
wife.
- She is your wife?
why does everyone ask me that?
Nats, don't talk rubbish.
who are they?
- He is my past.
A gambler. He's on his way to Goa
to gamble. I've reasoned with him.
I told him not to gamble, didn't I?
- yes.
Nats, now I'm convinced
that you're cured.
It's all because of you.
you're going to Goa, aren't you?
I own the Alfredo Hotel in Goa.
Take this matchbox.
- To torch the hotel?
Oh no. I'll sign the matchbox.
Show it at the counter,
you'll get a discount.
So it's for the discount! Thank you.
- I live there.
Don't torch the hotel.
Nats darling, I want some coffee.
Sure. Sit here, I'll get
it. I'll get coffee.
Bye, guys.
- Bye.
Her husband is so sweet.
- A pet, not sweet.
He was trying to brainwash me.
Two coffee. One black, one brown,
little sugar in one...
Excuse me... is this your baby?
yes, our baby. we're married.
Just married. - Just married?
And a Quick baby, eh?
Actually, we had a baby that's
why we had to marry.
I see. But the baby seems familiar.
It's time for the flight, Priya.
- wait.
you're going to Goa, aren't you?
I own the Alfredo Hotel in Goa.
Give this matchbox signed by me at
the counter, you'll get a discount.
Bye.
where have I seen the baby...?
If we take the flight, we'll have
to share...
...the 2.5 million with another guy.
we'll have to take a bus. - what
if he's recognised in the bus?
I'm an actor! Call his mother and
tell her that we're coming by bus.
In the meantime, I'll
give him a makeover.
See? with the red hair,
he's looking so handsome...
...just like me. what do you say?
Not to worry. In this makeover, not
even his mother will recognise him.
who will give us the money then?
- when you are angry...
you look like my dad.
Joking.
Idiot! what are you upto?
- Hush.
That man back there is suspicious.
He's been staring at the kid.
Must we walk to Goa then...?
- No. Let's just pretend...
that we're his parents. Okay?
Pinku's mother, he is hungry.
All right, Pinku's father. I'll feed
him milk at the next bus-stop.
No. Mother's milk is the
best for the baby.
Kishen, we've reached Panvel.
He's blind.
- you are blind, not him.
Hands off!
Even if someone really suspects,
don't touch me.
Save some for me.
I drank of it. - No problem.
It's okay with partners.
I mean, it's okay with
business partners.
Here!
your boyfriend?
"All day..."
"all night..."
"All day...
"all night..."
"you linger in my eyes"
"24x7 I think of you"
"All day...
"all night..."
"you linger in my eyes"
"24x7 I think of you"
"I'm always lost"
"I also endure restlessness"
"I'm always lost"
"I also endure restlessness"
"Do I call this love...?"
"Or madness?"
"Every moment..."
"I think of you"
"Do I call this love...?"
"Or madness?"
"Every moment..."
"I think of you"
"All day... all night..."
"you are in my mind" every moment"
"This is my punishment
for falling in love"
"It's your intoxication
every moment"
"This is my punishment
for falling in love"
"you made me pine"
"I could..."
"die for you"
"you made me pine"
"I could..."
"die for you"
"All day..."
"all night..."
"I see you everywhere"
"24x7 I think of you"
you broke my bottle!
A broken bottle augurs
well. Good luck.
So give me 50 bucks for the
good luck. - 50 bucks?
It was my liQuor bottle.
- But it was empty.
would it not break if it were full?
- Sure...
but it was empty.
- That's why I asked 50.
It's 100.
- No problem.
I'll break another bottle
in your name.
A casino outside too? They're
swindling people everywhere.
Soon the casino will belong to me.
Long live gambler god man.
104.
14.
Long live gambler godman.
Come, baby.
There! 14.
Godman, you've done it! I won.
want to meet gambler godman?
I'll introduce you to him!
Good evening, young lady.
Good evening.
- Congratulations.
you are the lucky winner of our
Lonely...
...And Only Beauty casino contest.
wow! Thank you. - Our company
offers you a gift hamper.
wow! where's the gift hamper?
- At your service.
So shall we go on a long drive?
Mr Gift Hamper, I'm married.
I don't mind. Rocky.
9820420420.
Those who don't have their
husbands along, have Rocky.
This is the problem in India.
90 percent of women...
don't have their husbands along.
And the other 10 percent...
are not with their husbands.
- For your kind information...
this survey of yours
is totally wrong.
I'm very happy with my married life.
Here's my calling card. you never
know when you'll need it.
Two cards? why? - you'll tear
off one card right here.
Oh no, I won't do that. I'd rather
tear off both the cards.
Excuse me...
- yes?
wow! Sex-bomb. your father
is a terrorist, isn't he?
yes. How do you know?
If you're through with losing for
the day, shall we go for dinner?
I'm not losing, I'm winning
every game tonight. Get it?
Really?
Don't you sit! you
are unlucky for me.
Even gambler god man's formula
will fail. Go away.
Look k. K, I'll really go away.
Just now a very handsome man
was propositioning me.
He must surely be a lover
of second hand stuff. Go on.
The game is on, go away. Please!
Sorry, godman.
Are you still happy with
your married life?
Please leave me alone.
- This is the problem in India.
90 percent of the men say that
their wives are unlucky.
The other 10 percent don't say that.
- But I'm really jinxed.
I don't believe this. women
bring men good fortune.
There's no luck greater
than lady luck. - Really?
yes. you will play tonight,
and also win. Come on.
Name the number.
16.
- Great. Sweet sixteen.
Come on. 16.
yes!
- yes! 16.
I won!
- I told you, you are lucky.
Never believe your husband.
Next number.
we sit together after so many years.
- yes.
Else, you'd always head to the
casino.
All thanks to you, darling.
I want you to play wife to everyone.
- what...?
I mean, may God grant a wife
like you to everyone.
what happened? why don't
you drink? - Nice tune.
Even the glass is dancing.
It's rocking.
Not lucky, you are
super-duper lucky.
you won again. you've broken
the record. 1.5 million.
Oh my God! For the first time
I realise that I'm not unlucky.
All thanks to you.
- How about a long drive now?
I'm still happy
with my married life.
An hour wasted.
Congratulations.
- Thank you.
you are the lucky winner.
I can't make the payment.
we have a rule here.
you can't leave the table if you
still have a rival playing.
you have to play?
- what nonsense.
when my husband used to lose, you'd
throw him out in...
...the middle of the game.
And now that I'm winning,
you're teaching me rules.
where's your Ms Sonia?
- She's at home right now.
I'll see how she doesn't
give me this 1.5 million.
I'm not a loser.
what are you doing?
Control yourself.
- I'm trying to do just that.
I can't control.
where to...?
- Casino.
To gamble again?
- No! To stop them from playing.
Darling, you changed me.
I want to reform them.
Really? wish you all the best.
Thank you, darling.
Nats, you are great.
I'm proud of you.
Long live gambler godman.
God! what happened? Epileptic fits?
Onions, please!
Onions and shoes won't help. - Then
what will stop you from dancing?
Let me sit on the counter.
Let me sniff the coin.
Coin?
you saved my life. Thank you
- Mention not.
what are you doing in the casino?
you stopped gambling, didn't you?
Even if a beggar strikes it rich,
he doesn't stop begging.
Likewise, no matter how poor a
gambler turns...
...he doesn't stop gambling.
well said.
- How much did you lose?
No way. I'm winning.
- Really?
I have gambler god man's formula.
- Gambler godman?
His dice picks my magic number.
The number wins it for me.
I'm having a ball.
If I get the formula, I can
win back all my hotels.
Don't play small games. Let's
play a game worth millions.
I don't have the money.
- I do. My money, your dice.
Fifty-fifty?
- yes.
Give me a counter.
Good evening.
- yes. I want 2.5 million in credit.
Sorry. It's a huge amount.
- I know. I want to pawn my hotel.
Give me the money first, I'll sign
the documents later.
No, sir. Madam has forbidden us
from mortgaging properties.
why?
- It affects the gamblers' families.
wow. when I lost four of my hotels,
she didn't think of my family.
And now when God has sent me an
angel to win back my hotels...
...your madam changes the rules.
Let me see how she doesn't
give me credit.
where've you been all these days?
Goa was lifeless in your absence.
I had been to America
to get Nats treated.
But Mr. Natwar was healthy. He was
never absent from the casino...
because of any illness. - That's
the illness I had gone to cure.
And Nats has changed so much that...
...he has gone to the casino
to reform others.
How about getting wicked then?
Let's go for a long drive?
No way.
Look into my eyes and
tell me what you see.
Nats...?
Strange.
2.5 million.
I'll settle all the
accounts tonight.
After months! I'm going to play like
I never played and won before.
This pair and this dice will
prove costly to this casino.
Nats! you started gambling
again? Come on, get up.
I said, get up!
- Lay off! what rot! Shut up.
Play.
- She is a goddess.
what goddess? She's a bloody witch.
To rid me off my gambling addiction
she tortured every part of my body.
Here, here... here too.
To save our married life, she
gave me shocks at such places...
that married life
is blissful no more.
The shocks killed everything but
the addiction of gambling.
Tell your father that! Play.
- Have you gone crazy?
Daddy will suffer a heart attack.
- Let Amarnath die.
I'll no more be yours as
well your father's slave.
Happy independence day!
Long live gambler godman.
where did you get that money?
Not from your father.
I'm going to win...
...all my hotels and throw
them in his face.
Amarnath!
I think he mortgaged Hotel Alfredo.
Sonia!
I'm looking at the crowd now.
But when I become a superstar...
this same crowd will watch
me getting off a bus.
After becoming a superstar,
you'll still travel by bus?
I mean, it'll be my personal bus.
And that restaurant...
- you will own it.
No. After I become an actor, the
two of us will dine there.
what say? - I have no intention
of dining with you.
Ours is just a business deal.
Once we get the reward...
we go our own ways. you dig?
Hi. where did you disappear?
I just went to freshen up.
To be honest, you
were already fresh.
Only two types of people drink like
this. Drunkards and the depressed.
you don't look like an addict, and
depression can be taken care of.
Not booze, you need
a friend right now.
A friend who'd understand you.
Number 3.
Number 3! Let me win just once.
Don't worry. Gambler godman
will set things all right.
All right, my foot! I'm stripped.
I have lost 2.4 million.
My last hundred-thousand
is at stake. Number 3.
"31"
I'm ruined!
I'm undone!
Tell me gambler god
man's whereabouts!
It's good to know that even after
losing so much you wish to meet him.
wish? I wish to drag him out
of his cave and kick him.
He'll stop giving out dice. Swine!
you trapped me, fraud.
Did I ask you to gamble? Did I?
- yes.
you came dancing here.
I lost the money I won.
I lost 50,000.
Give me 50,000 now!
- I lost 2.5 million. Give me that.
I should give you 2.5 million? Had
I that much money, would I gamble?
Am I mad? Am I a fool?
- you mean I'm a fool. Am I a fool?
Of course. you can't abuse your
rich father-in-law otherwise.
Bloody fraud! Devil's disciple.
Rich woman's poor slave!
The shocks have driven you crazy!
you are insane. you are mad.
you talk about shocks,
eh? How dare you?
I won't spare you!
- I won't spare you either.
Give me my money, my watch, my
chain... I've lost everything.
Get lost! what will you do?
- what will you do?
what will you do?
- what will you do?
what will you do?
- what will I do? I have nothing.
what will you do?
Don't touch me! My wife is going
to divorce me because of you.
you think my wife will spare me?
Have we lost the way? Ask someone.
who do I ask at this hour of the
night? This tree? This road?
All right, I'll ask this lamppost.
Sorry.
why did you catch it?
- It'd have broken otherwise.
It was empty anyway.
wouldn't it have broken
if it were full?
No need to thank me. I helped you,
now you must do me a favour.
Can you tell me where
36, China Town is?
you're on the wrong road.
Turn back...
and go straight to the dead-end.
Is the mansion there?
- No. The wine shop.
Get me a bottle. Or I won't tell you
that the mansion is right behind.
Thanks for not telling us.
I'll find the mansion, myself. Come.
wow! when I become a superstar, I'll
build a mansion just like this one.
where's the bell?
How did the gate open on its own?
- Look down.
His mother left the door
open for us. - yes.
The door's always left open, that's
why the baby went missing.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Strange. It's open too.
Ma'am.
Ma'am, I brought your baby back.
Sorry. Ma'am, we brought
your baby back.
Looks like she fell asleep waiting.
Strange. we came here with a bearer
cheQue of 2.5 million...
and the bank is sleeping?
Let's go upstairs. Come on.
Just walk into someone's room?
- we've brought back her lost child.
The lady will be so happy, she's
going to adopt me too.
May be the servants fell asleep.
So many rooms!
where do we look for her?
you go that way, I go here.
what happened Priya?
what are you staring at?
Something's shining.
It's a diamond bracelet.
Forget it, it doesn't belong to us.
- I know.
It must be the lady's. If we
return it, we'll be rewarded.
Stuck.
what happened? Tell me.
There's a hand... along
with the bracelet.
whose hand?
Dead body.
Lord, deliver me from this mess!
Praise be to Thee, O Lord Hanuman.
Hey! Run!
Priya! wake up! Run.
Run!
Over there.
we don't want the bracelet!
Come on. - The baby is inside.
It's his own house. Come on!
- If his mother has been killed...
his life could be in danger too.
- Really?
Go to the gate, I'll
get the baby. Go on.
It's Quite dark...
I can't see a thing.
I can't see my own shoes, how
can I see someone else's?
Son, do something... darling,
show me the way out.
Come on, son.
Show me the way out. Come, baby.
Run, Priya! The murderer is inside.
- what...?
Did you see him?
- No, but he saw me.
I only saw his shoes and eyes. Run!
Stop! why are we running?
we did not kill anyone.
who will believe us? Only three
people know the fact.
you, I and the corpse.
No one will believe us, and
the corpse won't speak.
These modern, young people!
why did you kiss me? - Just to
ward off the cops. It's okay.
Okay? Don't you kiss me
like this ever again.
Then how do I do it?
- you don't do it!
Okay, sorry. we need
to get out of Goa.
But the baby...? He must
be sent to his relatives.
Okay.
See that police jeep? Let's
just leave the baby there.
Right. Then we'll call up and
tell madam about the murder.
what...?
- The cops will get the baby...
and also find out the murderer.
Okay.
"Goa Police"
I hate night duty. Lonely
nights scare my wife.
I see. what does she do then?
- what will she do?
She calls the watchman.
- And during day duty?
No worries. The washer man...
...the milkman, vegetable vendor...
everyone drops by.
who's that?
Inspector Ravi from China Town
Police Station. How can I help you?
Inspector, I'd like to give
you some information.
Go right ahead.
- Sonia Chang has been murdered...
in 36, China Town.
- what? Sonia Chang murdered?
The caller says Sonia Chang
has been murdered, sir.
Trace the call.
How did you discover the murder?
- Don't ask Questions.
Get to the mansion at once, you
might even find the assassin.
Did you see the assassin?
- yes. His eyes as well as his legs.
Everyone has eyes and
legs. who are you?
A well-wisher.
Silly chap. Instead of racing to the
scene of crime, he was passing time.
No, he must be tracing the call.
Hurry up or they will be here.
Relax. For all the movies that I've
seen...
...the cops have never been on time.
Damn! Run!
Sorry, I've never seen the
Goa Police in action.
Let's take the first bus
out of here. C'mon.
Hold on.
what?
- I forgot my bag in the mansion.
Forget it. Come on.
- How can I? It has my passport.
To hell with it. you are
not flying out. C'mon.
The passport carries my name...
...address and phone number.
If the cops find it...
...they'll think I murdered her.
Let's go and fetch it, please.
we? who's we?
Look, our partnership ends here. you
go your way, I go mine. Please.
Please don't do this. If the cops
reach home...
...Papa will get a heart attack.
My Papa suffered two already. If
he suffers another, he's had it.
Besides, the cops are here.
I'm out of this.
All right. I'll go alone.
wait, Priya.
At least give me some money for
the bus fare before leaving.
Please.
I'm ruined. I'm on the streets.
I have no money to
go back to Mumbai.
How do I go to the hotel?
How do I face my wife?
Gambler godman didn't even leave me
enough money to consume poison.
The fraud fooled me. The cur.
If I'm forgiven a murder, I'll
kill the godman. The swine!
A case?
It's heavy. It's loaded.
I'll pick up the dice.
Godman, forgive me, I cursed you.
Godman, may you live a thousand
years. Bless me.
Nobody here. Let's go.
Long live the godman.
Long live the godman.
Hi.
you...?
Actually, after we parted,
I went to a temple.
I asked Him if I should
help you or not.
That's when a flower
fell on my head...
and I got His hint. And here I am.
Thanks. you found out a temple at
this hour of the night in Goa.
I'm an actor, after all.
Thank God the police aren't here.
Shall we...?
- No, you won't go in. I'll go.
what if the cops come?
- Don't worry about me.
Just go away and don't tell
anyone that we ever met.
And if I manage to come out, we'll
go out for a candlelight dinner.
But yes, the bill...
- you will foot it.
you hate it when
women foot the bill.
Correct.
Don't worry. we'll go back
to Mumbai together.
