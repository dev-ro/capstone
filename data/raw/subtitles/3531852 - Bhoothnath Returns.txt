'Well, in this world there
are two kinds of ghosts.'
'Two kinds.'
'The ones who stay back
because of an unfulfilled desire.'
'They are stuck in this world
till their desire isn't fulfilled.'
'Like him.'
'Why are you still stuck here, sir?'
Till Sweetie doesn't
offer a wreath to my grave..
This Lobo's ghost
isn't going anywhere.
No.
'l think he has become
a tad too emotional.'
Go..
- 'Okay, okay.. Okay.'
'And what about you, ma'am?'
He took the ulcer out of my stomach
but forgot his mobile inside.
Let him die,
l'll thrash him and escort him up.
'And you?'
l just want to know
who left this manhole open.
Same
'Okay.'
'All the best.'
'And then there are
those who are like me.'
'Who, aftertheir
desire is fulfilled..'
'Declare their innings
and return to the pavilion.'
'And this pavilion is called..'
'The Ghost World.'
This Ghost World isn't
like you think it is.'
'lt's like an exotic resort.'
'That's all.'
'Ghosts chill out over here.'
'Spend theirtime as they please.'
'Enjoy their ghostly powers.'
'Chitchat.'
That's Mrs. Rastogi.
She too is dead!
She died because of malaria.
How cheap.
Ladies, l tell you.
'And they wait fortheir next life.'
'This grand building
that you see before you..'
'This is the main office.'
'The Main office.'
Wow!
Surely the building is amazing.
But the work in here is just
like a government office.
Yes.
So, don't keep your
expectations too high.
Yes.
Brother..
No, brother..
Brother you were born in lndia..
But you died as an NRl, right?
ln Canada.
So try the Canada department.
Okay? Okay bye.
Yes?
So?
They got married yesterday, right?
Let Mrs. Apte get pregnant at least.
Then we'll send you.
Okay? okay.
Name?
Kailash Nath.
Kailash Nath!
Oh! So you are
Bhoothnath (Ghost Nath).
Yes.
Bhoothnath (Ghost Nath).
Good. Good.
How long will l have to wait
for my next life?
That depends on what you wish to be.
A mosquito, a fly, an ant, a flea.
Ready delivery.
Dog, cat, goat, pig..
lf you wish to be any of
these, then that'll take a week.
And to be an actor's dog you'll
have to give a written application.
That's beyond our powers.
lt's decided by that lucky draw.
l want to be a human.
Then take this token.
And wait.
Ten crore one thousand twenty-nine.
How long do l have to wait?
''Token number 13,482.''
lt's a long wait.
When yourturn comes,
meet the senior officer.
Next!
Thank you sir.
What?
Everyone's laughing at me.
What's going on?
How do you expect them not to.
Why?
You've made a mockery out of ghosts.
Mockery out of ghosts?
- Yes.
How so?
You couldn't scare
a kid on earth.
What was his name?
Aah...Banku!
''Mr. Banku''
''Mr. Banku, never gets scared,
Mr. Banku''
Got it?
Mr. Bhoothnath, where do you think
you are going? Excuse me!
lt's not yourturn.
You cannot go upstairs.
l'll cancel yourtoken Bhoothnath.
Excuse me, sir.
- Sir. Sir. He has come out of turn.
Shh..
Sir..
Sir, for how long will this go on?
For how long what will go on?
Sir, everyone is laughing at me.
You only gave them the chance.
Sir, that kid could see me.
How's that my fault?
Umm..That's ourtechnical fault.
Because of which some people
can see ghosts and some can't.
We're working on it.
But you should've scared him.
Sir, what has happened has happened.
Then what's happening,
let that happen too.
Sir please do something
it's getting very embarrassing.
Please, sir.
Please. Please. Please.
Fine.
Let's do one thing.
Let's send you back to earth.
Go there and scare a
few kids and clear your name.
But sir, my number..
it's going take a long time.
Not as a human being.
But as a...ghost.
Can you do that?
l can do anything.
But you need to think...
Or else, instead of winning respect
You might end up losing
even your self-respect.
Well in that case sir...
You can laugh all you want.
Okay, as you please.
What have you done, sir.
Look...there are three things really
missing in our Ghost World.
Entertainment.
Entertainment. Entertainment.
And he is entertainment?
'Forthe first time, a ghost was
returning back to earth as a ghost.'
'What was l supposed to do,
my honourwas at stake.'
'But then, another question arose.'
'Which kid should l scare?'
Uncle, give me a burger.
'Alas l found my target.'
Aye...get lost from here.
How dare you..
One whack on your head
and you'll become a ghost.
What are you doing?
Can't you see his fault..
Do you want one too?
'This kid seems too dangerous.'
These ghosts are so funny.
True.
Any passing by spirit, please come.
Any passing by spirit, please come.
Any passing by spirit, please come.
Just a minute.
Why are we calling a ghost?
First we'll bully him
then we'll make him do our homework.
Get going, Bhoothnath!
Better scram off.
Everyone seems like a saint
while taking the token.
By the time they become children
they become complete devils.
Come on, let's go home.
What happened?
- What happened?
Don't you know who stays here?
What's the big deal...
why are you guys getting scared?
A ghost lives here.
We shouldn't play here. My mom
says ghosts come here after dark.
There is no such thing as ghosts.
l too, used to think
so before l died.
Ghosts are real, my boy.
And they can be very scary.
Bwha-ha-ha-ha...
Who laughed?
Must be some drunkard.
Bwha-ha-ha-ha...
Come before us if you have the guts.
l am a ghost!
Get scared...l am a ghost!
He won't listen like this.
Remove our victory's stuff out.
Yes, boss.
Oh no Ayeee.. Ohhh...
Oh God!
Next time if he messes with us
we'll burst him like a firecracker.
Kids these days, by God.
l can understand if they
aren't scared of theirfather..
..but they aren't even..
..they aren't
even scared of ghosts.
Hey, you!
Why were you messing
around with those kids?
Why are you staring at me?
l am talking to you.
Why are you looking behind?
Hey..
..you can see me?
These are eyes, not buttons.
Why are you touching your hair?
What's in your beard?
You can really see me?
Yes. So?
Oh no, sir! Not again!
Change your system at least now!
Here's another child who can see me.
What are you doing?
Why wouldn't l be able to see you?
Kiddo, you don't know who l am.
Why? Are you The lnvisible Man?
No. l'm a ghost!
Then l'm a witch.
Will you marry me?
Everything l am saying
is going over your head.
Come to my level
and then we shall talk.
Come on up.
Oh damn! You really are a ghost.
Are you feeling scared now?
Poorfears no one.
Here also you are delivering
dialogues. Get down.
That's awesome.
Sit here. Come on.
Sit. Sit down.
Hi!
l'm Bhoothnath.
l'm Akhrot (Walnut).
Akhrot?
lt means solid from
outside but soft from inside.
Can l ask you one thing?
Ask two.
What should l do
that smart kids like you..
..get scared of simple
ghosts like me.
You know what your problem is?
lf you want to scare kids then
do something scary not funny.
Hey, come to the point and
tell me what to do.
See, this is lndia.
Here no matter how
bad the movie is..
..if the trailer is a hit
then the movie is a hit.
Now watch me set a
mind-blowing trailerfor you.
First day first show, house full.

He's lying.

Here, l'm throwing it again.
l'm lying.
Are you scared now?
- Yes.
Are your pants wet?
- Yes.
Muuummmy!
You overacted a little.
But in lndia, only overacting works.
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
The thing is, l might
be small but my heart is big.
But why did you do this for me?
'Cause l liked your beard.
ldiot, there's no such
thing as a free lunch.
This is how the world functions.
Can l ask you one thing?
Ask two.
Now l'll kick you out of this house.
ldiot, now you are
getting too big for your boots.
No.
The thing is, these school-going,
English-speaking kids..
..don't let slum kids like me
play with them.
So now l'll kick
you out of this house.
And they will let me into
their cricket team.
Now do as l say.
The ghost will run away.
Got it?
Fold your hands.

Mosquitoes don't bite you, do they?
You neitherfeel hungry northirsty.
Do you take bath?
Amazing.
Do you want to be a ghost?
No, man. l'm good as l am.
At least l'm alive.
What do you do?
Foreigners that come
here on a holiday..
..they want to see poor lndia,
dirty lndia..
..l show them my area..
by spicing things up a little..
..and make some money through it.
Come,
l'll show it to you as well.
But l don't have any money.
Stupid, who will
take money from a ghost?
Come on.
This is my area.
''Come on,
put some wipers on your glasses.''
''Take out those cotton
balls from your ears.''
''l'm telling you a story.
This is Dharavi, my dear.''
''The movie screen is torn.

You have one week to pay.

Got it?
That's the most important
thing in my life.
What?
The most important thing in my life.
What?
My mother.
Oh.
Come,
l'll introduce you to my mother.
Have you lost your mind?
She'll get scared if
you introduce herto a ghost.
l don't hide anything
from my mother.
Anyways, she only fears God.
Come on.
- lt'll be a problem.
Come on!
He's bound to get thrashed.
Why are you standing
there like a ghost?
l want to introduce you to someone.
Then ask him to come inside.
He is here.
You've caught a
snake or a frog again?
Oh yes, you cannot see him.
Why?
- Because he's a ghost.
He. Here.
Damn, did you try drugs?
Show me your eyes!
Open your mouth!
l told you, you'll get thrashed.
Akhrot is telling the truth.
l really am a ghost.
''Oh Hanuman, the ocean of knowledge
and virtues, may you be victorious.''
Come on, man.
- l had told you..
..not to pee close to that
sacred tree in the evening.
See now... a ghost is after you.
''You are the trusted
messenger of Rama.''
But he is a very nice ghost.
- Shut up.
''You are known as son of
Anjana and son of the Wind God.''
Has he left?
You had said that
she fears only God.
Look Mr. Ghost,
he is a fatherless child.
He has made a mistake.
Please forgive him.
We are very poor.
We have nothing to give you.
Please leave.
He's gone.
He's gone?
Don't utter a word. Stay quiet.
Swear by me.
Swear by me that you
won't meet that ghost again.
But he is a very nice ghost.
Swear by me.
l swear.
Tell me something.
- Yes?
Up there, have you met anyone who
died because someone broke a promise?
No, l haven't.
Then it's fine.
Don't mind my mother,
she has seen very bad days.
Can l help you in any way?
Why?
Because l want to help you.
How can you help me?
l will take some money from
a rich guy and give it to you.
He won't even realize that he suffered
a loss and you'll benefit a little.
lf l had to lead a thief's
life then l could have.
Like this.
Hey..
But no.
l don't want to live such a life.
What kind of a man are you?
You picked his pocket.
Why are you unnecessarily
raising your blood pressure?
Anyways, you are a ghost.
And a ghost's job is to
cause problems, not solve them.
What do you mean?
l mean..
..take Rawat's building for example.
- Okay.
Naseeb Heights.
- Okay.
There's no building as
unfortunate as that one in Mumbai.
lts construction has been
stalled since the past 11/2 years.
Why?
There's a spirit like you
residing overthere. A ghost.
Anyone who goes in,
comes out injured.
He throws bricks
and stones at everyone.
You want to make an honest living?
- Yes.
Come.
Where?
- Come on.
Here we less likely to get work..
..more likely to get whacks.
Do you have ten bucks?
He won't agree with that.
- He will. He will.
One cannot even buy half
a cup of tea and bread-butter.
Since you have gone up,
prices have gone up too.
But man's greed
is still the same.
Give.
Can l come in, sir?
Who allowed you to come in?
Your Naseeb, sir.
- What?
lf you can spare two minutes
then l can save you millions.
ls it?
Oh damn!
Afreaking dangerous building!
''Oh Lord, save me from all evil!''
''Oh Lord, save me from all evil!''
Hey.. that day you were saying 'poor
fears no one'. Now what happened ?
l just made that up
to come across as smart.
You got scared! You got scared!
Damn you!
Will you really be able
to make the ghost go away?
Come on, man.
Have some confidence in me.
l have confidence.
l was just checking if
l am the only one who has it.
Oh damn!
Excuse me, mister.
Please listen to me.
Go away from here.
What do you want?
l want to help you and this kid
lf you leave you
will get salvation..
..and this kid will make some money.
Why should l leave?
l was the engineer of this building.
l died getting crushed under a slab
but it made no difference to anyone.
And those life insurance guys..
.. bloody bribe seekers.
They still haven't
given my family the money.
Go and see in what condition
my wife and child are in.
They can't even manage
one square meal a day.
And you are concerned
about his money!
What if l get them
what is rightfully theirs?
Then..
..then why will l stay here.
Fine.
Let me try.
But..
..why haven't you done anything?
What can a person
do after he is dead?
l thought the same before l died.
lt's simple.
Bribe the officer
and get the work done.
Hey..
..bribing the officerwill only
help this engineer get his money.
Nothing will happen to all those
cheques still stuck in his file.
l didn't get you.
Look..
..a person does a bad deed
because he doesn't fearthe good
This is very important.
Listen to me very carefully.
The day the evil in him
starts fearing the good..
..he will think twice before
doing a bad deed.
Don't you think l am a bit
too small to say all this?
No, you go and stand at the crease.
l'll do the batting.
Let's go.
And what do you want?
Sir, Mr. Shrivastav's file is stuck.
What's wrong with your voice?
Well, sir, my words are powerful,
hence my voice is also powerful.
Oh really, which file?
Nikhil Shrivastav's
insurance claim file.
Son, such jobs take
time to complete.
Got it?
lt's been 11/2 years.
How much more time do you need?
Another 150 years, what will you do?
Fearthe good, sir.
You won't be able to sleep
in peace if you do such things.
l've been sleeping in
peace since the past 20 years.
At home as well as here.
Are you done?
Get going now.
What are you doing?
lt's been two days
and nothing has happened.
He is a government officer
He takes time in doing everything.
He is bound to take
some time to mend his ways.
Look, there he comes.
Look at his condition.
Mr. Shrivastav's cheque.
ls this the full amount or
have you taken a cut?
The full amount.
Okay. Good night.
Good night.
Thanks.
Welcome.
You'll be going
to Ghost World, right?
Yes.
Don't have high expectations.
Here you go. Take it.
Thanks.
Hey, whom did you say thank you to?
To God. To God. God.
God. Thank you very much.
- Thank you, God. Thank you.
Mr. Shirke, you know everything.
l'll pay the rent as
soon as l get the money.
l haven't taken up the responsibility
to help every beggar settle down.
Eitherfind another
job orfind another room.
Sir..
This year's rent.
All of it.
See you next year.
That's great, Meena.
Your son's taken
up a good profession.
From where did you
get this money? - Mom..
From where did you get it?
lt's an honest income.
Look, we haven't
done anything wrong.
Please hear me out.
Afterthat if you feel that
he shouldn't be with me..
..then l will leave.
Please.

Who was on the line?
One of Bhau's men.
Who's Bhau?
He was a local goon of our area..
..now he has become a dacoit.
What do you mean?
l mean he's the
politician of our area.
Oh.
He wants you to vacate
another building?
Yes.
Can't you refuse it?
No, l will have to go there.
Bhau, that boy is sitting inside.
ls he of any use?
- Yes.
What has he done so far?
- He got Rawat's building vacated.
How long did it take him?
- Three days.
What are you saying?!
What's this?
- Hello, Bhau.
What's this?
Son, go call yourfather.
l don't have time.
Bhau, he's the one.
What do you mean by he's the one?
He is the one who
vacated Rawat's Building.
You..
You get the buildings vacated?
Yes, sir.
What would you like to have?
Tea? Milk?
Let's get to business.
He's the one.
- l told you
He's the one.
First let me tell you the price.
For you, 20 lakhs rupees.
l don't take up illicit jobs.
l'll take your leave.
- Hey! - Sit! Sit! Sit!
Sit down.
What's your problem? Sit down.
Who said it's illicit?
l've learnt it from
the streets where l live.
The more illicit the job,
the higherthe price.
Boss, he's the one.
No doubt about that.
Come close.
l'll tell you something.
You'll benefit from it.
A property worth 300 crores rupees has
been stuck since the past 6 months.
20 lakh rupees is a small
price to get it started.
lt's okay if you
want to do it cheaper.
We will adjust
So what do you say?
Okay, sir.
Get him some tea.
No, get him some tea.
You will have tea, right?
You won't have milk, right?
l'll call fortea.
You'll be settled
for life afterthis job.
Then l'll go back.
Do you have to go back?
l will have to go.
l'm not a very emotional person
but l'll miss you.
l too, will miss you.
l've seen many people who've
sold themselves for money.
But this is the first time
l'm seeing a ghost doing that.
Well done.
How much money is Bhau
giving you to get rid of me?
How much?
20 lakh rupees.
And do you know how much
money are those people getting..
..from whom this land was
snatched to make this building?
Zero.
Look, we didn't know
anything about it.
What do you know?
You helped few spirits cross over
Made a few corrupt
officers fall in line
And you think you have
made this world a better place!
Do you think this..
..building's problem will
get solved once you get rid of me?
How will you get rid of them?
They..
All of them..
Those who didn't
vacate their houses..
..their houses were burnt down..
..those who didn't sell themselves,
their deaths were bought..
..and people like me, who tried
to raise their voice, were silenced.
And no one did anything?
What can anyone do?
This cancer is not restricted
to one part of the country.
lt has spread all
across the country.
lf you cure the
cancer in Dombivali..
..then what about Kandivali?
What about Dadar?
Will you cure the whole of Mumbai?
What about Delhi?
What about Ludhiana?
Ranchi, Rotak, Jabalpur,
Patna, Surat..
From where all will
you get rid of the cancer?
And how much cancer
will you get rid of?
On one hand those who can change this
are just twiddling theirthumbs.
On the other, people like Bhau..
..have themselves become cancer
and are ruining the country.
And people like me,
who raise their voices, are killed.
lt makes it to the
newspaper headline..
..and the next day
everything becomes normal.
People are sleeping.
This country is dying.
Let it die.
Don't make a business
out of someone's death.
lf it had happened to you then...
Go away from here.
Whether anyone does
something or not..
..l won't let any building
stand over here.
Leave!
Am l smiling right?
Yes, Bhau.
- Okay. Good.
Now take one in this pose.
Now this pose.
One more. Click one more.
- Yes.
This.. this is a famous pose.
Click it.. click it
Bhau?
That building boy is here.
He says he can't do the job.
Why? What happened?
- He says it's not his cup of tea.
Send him in.
Akhrot.
- You move aside.
Come here.
Akhrot, come here.
What happened?
- l cannot do it.
What?
- l can't.
Did anyone say anything?
You need more money?
Tell me!
l told you, l cannot do it!
Hey, you cannot afford
to say no to me.
You are lucky the elections
are around the corner.
Otherwise l'd chop you and
throw you in the same gutter..
..that you came from.
Now quietly get
the building vacated.
You have time only
until the elections.
Got it?
You only have time
until the elections.
Go.
Go!
At least let me smile.
Bhau held me by my collar
and you didn't do a thing.
ls this ourfriendship?
Then what should have l done?
What should have l done?
Today Bhau has held you by your
collartomorrow someone else will.
From whom all will l save you?
Didn't you hear
what that ghost said?
This country is full
of people like Bhau.
Then raise the fear
of good in them as well.
People like Bhau don't fear good
They only fear loss of power.
Then Bhau cannot be scared.
He has very easily won
the past three elections.
Why didn't any good
candidate stand against him?
They did.
Some took the bullet.
Some took the money.
lt's a tradition of our country.
Yes.
There must be someone.
A good candidate who can
stand against Bhau this time.
There must be someone.
Why don't you?
You are good.
And no one can kill you either.
What do you think?
Very bad idea.
Why? Because it is not your idea,
it is bad?
Don't behave like a kid
l am a kid.
A dead person can't
contest elections.
How can he?
ls there such a rule?
- Then what!
What strange rules our country has.
You find one good person
with great difficulty.
And they have a problem
with that also.
This is what we call
democracy, kiddo.
Who's crazy?
Let it be.
You still haven't slept?
What are you thinking about?
l'm thinking what will
happen to our country.
Those who need to
think are sleeping.
You too should go to sleep.
Please contest in the elections..
Yourtape recorder has started again
l told you, a ghost cannot
contest for elections.
Look..
..l know a failed lawyer.
Let's check with him.
lt doesn't cost us to ask.
Come on.
Let's go.
- Yes.
What are you saying?
l should shut down my
factory and open a bangle shop?
Or you want me to consume
iron and commit suicide.
Now get back to work
He..
- You work for me.
He's a lawyer?
- Now go and get it again.
He was.
Law has no place for
a nice people like him.
l hope he is not faint-hearted.
Who are you lying to?
Here, have some tea and go home.
Look Gabdi, you know l don't lie.
You mean to say that there
is a ghost in my factory?
Yes.
Crazy.
Who..
Who is he?
How are you, Mr. Gabdi?
He took my name?
l asked, how are you?
Sir, l am absolutely
fine with your grace.
How can l help you?
l needed a legal advice.
l understand, sir.
Old lndian problem.
A person's life comes to
an end but his case never ends.
Don't drag this like a court case.
Just answer my question.
That too in short.
Tell us..
..what kind of a person can
contest the Lok Sabha elections?
Why?
Don't ask questions, just answer.
According to the rule book, sir..
..the candidate should
be an lndian citizen.
He is.
But who is contesting?
Continue.
He should be at least 25 years old.
25..
He is.
No criminal record.
No. Not at all.
He should be mentally sound.
He is.
That's all.
- That's all?
That's all. - No educational
qualification is required?
What education qualification?
A degree in what?
That means a person who isn't
even eligible to get a clerk's job..
..can actually run our country.
What can one do?
This is lndia. Hail lndia.
Anything else?
Yes, one last question.
What?
- The one contesting..
The one who is contesting
in the elections..
Yes.
..does he need to be alive?
No. No, no.
lt's not said so in any rule book.
ln any book whatsoever.
No.
Thank you.
Akhrot..
Akhrot..
Hey, come on, man.
At least hear me out.
No, l don't want to hear anything.
Think about it.
You asked me to come
with you to a lawyer. l came
Now l won't get into
the mess of elections.
l won't be contesting
in any elections.
Look, it's not fair
for such people to win.
You are only thinking
about yourself.
Think about our country as well.
Look, what state our country is in.
''Lord, keep an eye.''
''Almighty, keep an eye.''
''Lord, keep an eye.''
''Almighty, keep an eye.''
''May everyone get your
blessings and grace.''
''Be concerned about everyone.''
''Lord, keep an eye.''
''Almighty, keep an eye.''
''No man should ever endure slavery.''
''No man should bow before another.''
''May all the differences resolve.''
''Distribute this land
and the sky equally among all.''
''No one should be in pain.''
''Be concerned about everyone.''
''Lord, keep an eye.''
''Almighty, keep an eye.''
''Lord, keep an eye.''
''Almighty, keep an eye.''
''Everyone should
hold their head high.''
''Give this strength to everyone.''
''No one should be able
to silence a rising voice, Lord.''
''May everyone get some work to do.''
''And everyone should
get a chance to rest.''
''A person who works hard,
his hard work should pay.''
''Keep a watch,
on every deed, on every thought.''
''Lord, keep an eye.''
''Almighty, keep an eye.''
''Lord, keep an eye.''
''Almighty, keep an eye.''
''Lord!''
''Lord!''
''Lord!''
So, what do you say?
What?
- What do you say?
Even if l contest in the elections,
who'll vote for a ghost?
lt will be a joke.
You are too young to vote.
'l am no more' to vote.
We won't get a single vote.
What if we get one vote?
From where will you get it?
Damn them!
l hope they don't get
waterwhen they are dying.
How should we poor people survive?
One never gets water!
What if you get one vote?
Then l'll think about it.
l'll get you one vote for sure..
Aunty..
Can l ask you a question?
Please don't get angry.
lf from our area,
a ghost contests in the elections..
A ghost?
- Yes.
l mean someone who will
get the roads repaired,
gets the gutters cleaned,
gets rid of all the garbage,
and gets water in these taps,
will you vote for him?
Son, these unpaved roads,
overflowing gutters, garbage..
We are used to it.
lf anyone can get water
even once during the day..
Then forget a ghost,
l'll even vote for a dog!
Yes.
People couldn't get us water.
Don't be stupid.
You think a ghost will get us water?
Oh really?
Are you sure?
By God.
You guys are getting serious.
Yes. - No, no, no.
As you please. As you please.
But as your lawyer..
l am your lawyer, right?
Yes.
- Yes.
Yes, so as your lawyer, it is
my duty to tell you a few things..
Like?
Like you filing a nomination
can cause a big commotion.
Are you getting me?
So, we need to keep
all the papers in order.
So that in future the opposition
doesn't disqualify your nomination.
Are you getting it?
What kind of documents?
l'll handle everything,
you just need to get two documents.
A police certificate
that he is not a criminal.
And a doctor's certificate
stating he is mentally stable.
A common man always prays that..
.. he never has to visit a doctor,
lawyer orthe police.
And l am about to
face all three of them.
Sir, please strike
out lawyerfrom your list.
Why?
What ''why''?
Some lawyers can be honest as well.
Keep it down, Gabdi.
- Why?
Otherwise,
they will place you in a museum.
Stop it! Are you planning
to mend the whole world orwhat?
He's crazy.
Sir..
Sir..
- Yes?
A ghost has come to meet you.
Shinde, how many times have
l told you not to drink on duty?
l swear, sir. Neverwhile on duty.
l'm telling the truth.
There is a ghost outside.
ls he here because we
suppressed his murder case?
No, not forthat.
He wishes to contest in the election.
He wants a clearance letterfor it.
A ghost will contest
in the election?
Please do it, sir.
lt's a little urgent.
Who said that?
- Not me.
lt's me, sir. Bhoothnath.
Please do it. lt's a little urgent.
Everyone comes here
with urgent work.
Someone got stabbed.
That's urgent.
Someone got hit by a drunk.
That's urgent.
A politician's sandals
got stolen from outside a temple.
That's urgent.
A celebrity's dog is lost.
That's urgent.
To clean up the city is urgent,
so are we detergents?
lnside the hearts of this country's
population there's only frustration.
Outside the system's constipation,
the situation is such..
..that everywhere
there's saturation.
Public wants to know, what's the
justification of this intoxication?
There is right to information,
but to that there is objection.
Police has the power,
but it has its own limitation.
The one who has designation
doesn't have the intention.
The one who has suggestion,
doesn't have the position.
What should people do in such
a situation, that's my question.
l'll do something, Mr. Ghost.
l'll do something.
But there's something
l can't understand.
Do you wish to embezzle
the people's money?
No.
Do you want illicit
land in yourfamily's name?
No.
Do you want to make a foreign
trip on public fund?
No.
Then do you wish to do social
service by becoming a politician?
Yes.
Yes?
Damn, he's impossible.
- Yes.
He didn't come to his
senses even after death.
Go.
l'll check all your records.
lf everything's well then l'll
give you an ''all clear'' certificate.
Okay?
- Thank you, sir.
See you.
Shinde..
- Yes?
Didn't you see him coming inside?
Sir, how could l see him?
And we are law enforcers.
And law is blind..
- l know. l know.
There's something
that's confusing me.
For you, should l give a normal
report or a post mortem report?
l didn't get you, sir.
Look, for someone who is dead,
a doctor gives a post mortem report.
But how can a post mortem report
tell if a person is insane or not?
Sir, post mortem is
done on the dead body.
And l am a soul.
And a soul lives forever.
And hence, l am alive.
So perform a test that you
would on someone who is alive.
Yes, yes. You got a point there.
Sir, you are a psychiatrist.
lt is not right for
you to get confused.
l am confused?
Now watch me confuse you.
Yes. l'll do an inkblot test on you.
Look at this.
What do you see in it?
Sachin's century.
l knew you were crazy.
How can you see..
Was l wrong, sir?
No.
What do you see in this?
Draupadi's disrobing scene.
Oh God!
And here, a sinking Titanic.
And at the moment you are
holding my ''OK'' certificate.
Yes.
Then take it.
Take it.
l've handled the police.
Great.
l've taken care
of the doctor as well.
Great.
Now?
- Great.
What!
l mean the election officer.
The election officer?
So, who is contesting
in the election?
A ghost.
Look, l don't have
time for your silly jokes.
This is not a joke, sir.
l am extremely serious
about contesting this election.
Really? - Yes.
There is nothing in
the rule book that states..
..that the person contesting
the election should be alive.
This..
Yes. There is no such rule..
Alright.
Who is proposing it?
- l am. l am his lawyer.
My name is Gabdi Kumar.
From which party?
An lndependent candidate.
You'll need to pay
10000 rupees forthis.
Here you go.
And ten people to nominate you.
Sure.
Alive.
What times have come!
Now even ghosts contest elections.
Sir, you have been conducting
elections for so many years.
You've seen many dishonest people
l am just an ordinary ghost.
We also want good people
to contest the election.
Yes.
- lf not alive, so be it.
This needs to be signed.
Sure.
Sign.
Lallan.
Lallan, once again please.
Please say that once again.
Bhau, you..
Sit down. Sit down. Shut up!
Lallan.
Bhau, a ghost is
contesting against you.
That's very smart of the opposition.
Now they won't have to
hide theirface when they lose.
l am not joking.
A ghost is contesting against you.
Then your job is in danger, Lallan.
Why?
Whose throat will
you slit this time?
Lallan..
This country's heating political
situation got some comic relief..
..when a ghost decided to contest
elections from Dharavi constituency of Mumbai.
The ghost of election
takes overthe country.
ls this the darkest day
in the history of democracy?
Can this be really happening?
- The country's politics has hit a new low.
Now parties are fielding
ghosts as candidates.
l told you so.
But you paid no heed to me.
Now they are making fun of us.
ls the ghost they are talking
about on the news yourfriend?
Yes, mom. l tried to talk him out.
But he never listens.
Now they are making fun of us.
Look Akhrot,
you better stay out of it.
No, mom. l'm staying out of it.
lt's his business not mine.
l am just supporting
him because he is my friend.
That too from outside.
Bhau is a dangerous guy.
Right. That's what l told him.
Why are you getting worried?
Look, water has come. Go.
l don't want any trouble.
This was my idea?
Look, there is just one person
in your party and that's me.
lf l leave,
your party will cease to exist.
What do you want to do?
l want to show them an
amazing trailer. What else?
Did that ring a bell?
Or do you want some more?
Something that was making you laugh
until yesterday will shock you today.
Because this time
from Dharavi in Mumbai..
..a ghost is actually
going to contest the election.
And he is at the moment
with us in the studio.
Mr. Bhoothnath..
- Yes.
.. why should our viewers believe
that you are actually a ghost?
lt is not theirfault.
lf l would've been alive today..
.. then perhaps l too
wouldn't have believed it.
But sir, can you do something which
makes our viewers believe that..
That.. that..
As you can see,
this is not a camera trick.
Mr. Bhoothnath is behind it.
Look, l am not here
to show tricks.
l just want to tell everyone
that this is not a joke.
l am fighting this election
and l am serious about it.
This ghost speaks in English.
Good. At least from somewhere
an educated person is contesting.
But sir, how can a ghost
stand forthe election?
No where in the rule
book does it state that..
..one needs to be alive
to contest the election.
l told you so.
Sir, this is causing uproar outside.
Uproar!
Why isn't there an uproar
when those who are accused..
..of embezzling billions
of rupees contest the election?
The ones who are
accused of hooliganism.
The ones who are accused of murder.
Right.
l am just an ordinary ghost.
Why is my contesting the
election causing such an uproar?
But sir, what made a
ghost contest the election?
When it's the question
of our country's future..
Some of the responsibility..
..lies on the shoulder
of this country's ghost as well.
He is here. He is here.
Just one question, please, sir.
One question, please, sir.
Sir..
- Sir..
Okay. Okay.
Just one question.
Sir, do you think the
public will vote for a ghost?
l just want to tell
them that l am not a ghost.
l am the future.
One more question, sir.
Just one more question, sir.
Sir. Sir..
- He left.
Where is he?
- Where is he?
And what would you
like to stay about this?
Jai Hind.
(Hail Motherland)
lsn't he the same building boy?
khajur (Dates).
- Akhrot.
Yes, Akhrot.
What is he doing there?
You have become very popular.
This isn't popularity.
This is curiosity.
Let's go and talk to them.
Where? There? No.
Let's go.
- No.
l won't go before a crowd.
You go and tell them l'm not here.
He's scared!
Where is he? Where is he?
Stop.
Bhoothnath is not here.
Please leave.
Bhoothnath..
- No one is in there.
Leave. Get going, aunty.
Komal is calling you. Go.
Scram. What? Leave.
Don't you all have work to do?
Scram. No one is in there. Leave.
Uncle, someone will steal
from your shop. Hurry up.
Please don't.
Give your support to this child.
Give him your blessings.
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib.
Ladies and gentleman, l have
a question for you. l want a reply.
This ghost who is
contesting the election..
..why is he fighting from our area?
Do you have an answer?
Do you? Do you?
You don't? You don't, right?
Let me tell you.
That's because through
our hard work and dedication..
..we have turned
this area into heaven.
Hey, stop it. What heaven?
That poor ghost got confused.
He thought, if there is
heaven on earth then it's here.
Applaud.
As soon as he passed away,
he came here.
So all of you
shouldn't get confused.
Bhoothnath, do something.
lf the dialogues are a
hit then the movie will be a hit.
And if its songs are a hit
then the movie will be super-hit.
But who will write the song?
We'll need to find a writerwho..
..has same problems
with the system like we do.
We have a small request to make,
Mr. Anurag.
Sir, l don't make movies on ghosts.
No, l want you to
write a song for us.
An item song, sir?
An election number.
l don't think l have a choice, sir.
No, l won't force you if you refuse.
But, you know that
it's for a very good cause.
Sir, l've a request to make.
You aren't visible.
And you walk while you talk..
..so it feels like you
are speaking in surround sound.
Anyways sir, we don't
have budgets for Dolby.
Here you go.
Better?
ls, he there?
Yes. Much better, sir.
l'll do it, sir.
- Thank you.
l've another request to make.
Sir, l cannot dance.
ldiot, at least hear him out.
Look, your songs are
a little adult in nature.
l got it, sir.
lt will be difficult,
but l'll do it.
Songs will be for adults
but they won't be only for adults.
l promise, sir.
- Thank you.
Come on.
You made him win
through a big margin.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the pride of your area..
Hard working, dedicated Bhau Sahib!
Our song is ready?
Then play it.
'And here comes a message
dedicated by the public..'
'..to Dharavi legislative assembly's
deceitful, corrupt dishonest..'
'..Bhau Sahib.'
''Keep your arrogance to yourself,
forthe best.''
''This order is issued
in public interest.''
''Better stay within
your limits.''
''Hello, hello.''
''Now, it's ourturn.''
''A little bit of whip.''
''Whoeverwas given, was fixed.''
''Our craziness is gaining fame.''
''A party..''
''Forthis reason..''
''A party is a must.''
''A party is a must.''
''A party is a must.''
''A party is a must.''
''Our party continues.''
''lt's now our responsibility.''
''Our party continues.''
''lt's now our responsibility.''
''l am a king.''
''Who can match up with me?''
''lt's God, who is my backbone.''
''Making everyone
dance to ourtunes..''
''We have stolen the show.''
''All the ladies and gentlemen,
get ready and come for some more.''
''We are so happy that
we are acting crazy.''
''A party..''
''Forthis reason..''
''A party is a must.''
''A party is a must.''
''A party is a must.''
''A party is a must.''
''Unstoppable, is our level.''
''Everything's done out in the
open, nothing underthe table.''
''You are devil's friend.''
''You should be banned.''
''Words don't affect you,
you should be hanged.''
''Oh, your horrific scams,
yourtime's up, man.''
''l have more guts than you,
come l'll clear all your doubts.''
''Now you will be exposed, your
honourwill go down the gutter hole.
''You won't be able to show
yourface afterthe exit-poles.''
''Our party continues.''
''lt's now our responsibility.''
''A party is a must.''
''A party is a must.''
So, did you enjoy that?
l've never danced at someone wedding
as much as l did at Bhau's funeral.
Bhau won't take it lying down.
Let's see what he does.
Media is waiting outside. Hurry up.
President, why do you worry?
Just because a crazy ghost says
that l am a thief then..
..that doesn't make me a thief.
Last year some obscene
accusations were made against you.
That doesn't mean you
were involved in it, right?
No, right?
Hearsay cannot kill anyone.
That's fine. But what
do we tell the high command?
And the people?
Ask the high command to worry
about other seats in the country.
And as far as the
people are concerned..
They will come,
applaud and then forget.
Sir, an election
is just like a circus.
Jokers are only there to pass time.
Tickets are bought
to watch the lion.
Don't worry.
Be rest assured. Let's go.
Sir.. Just one question, please.
Sir! Sir! Sir!
- Just one question.
What would you like to say regarding
the accusations about your scams?
Look, Mr. Bhoothnath has
made these accusations on me.
Now Mr. Bhoothnath..
Excuse me..
Now Mr. Bhoothnath..
What happened, Bhau?
Mr. Bhoothnath..
Mr. Bhoothnath.. Stop tickling me.
What?! What is he doing?
Bloody con man.
Bhoothnath! Bhoothnath!
Don't slap me.
Can you see that?
He is misusing his powers!
You are kicking me!
Mr. Bhoothnath!
Mr. Bhoothnath! What are you doing?
You are kicking me!
This is..
No! No! No!
Don't do that again. Enough. Enough!
Mr. Bhoothnath is doing this,
not me.
Mr. Bhoothnath! Mr. Bhoothnath!
Bhau, please. Please.
Hold the hands.
Hold them tight.
Enough.
Enough. Bhau, please. Enough.
As you can see how Mr. Bhootnath
is misusing his powers?
No, Mr. Bhootnath. No!
He's playing dirty.
Who saw the peacock
dance in the forest?
What do you mean?
You just wait and watch.
l just don't understand, sir.
l had pressed record,
but nothing got recorded.
l got good shots, sir.
l don't know what happened to them.
What's this?
Where's the footage?
Watch how a dog bravely
fought a panther.
lt's the same pantherwho has been
troubling people since the past one month...
To seek revenge for his girlfriend
her boyfriend married her mother.
And the girl's family..
To protest inflation people
protested by carrying empty bags.
And here's the weatherforecast..
Lallan!
Bhau!
- Why aren't we on the news?
l'll find out.
Call the news channel.
- Okay, Bhau.
What happened, Bhau?
- Who is it?
l heard someone made all
your hard work go down the drain.
Who is it?
The one who hit you,
beat you.
Thrashed you.
At least hear me out.
Just shut up and listen!
lf l want l can make
you shut shop in no time.
But l am not like you.
Today you accused me of doing
something that l haven't done.
Now l will do something
that you have nevertried to do.
Not in my ears!
Keep watching the news.
Lallan!
Then l sprayed water...
You've so proudly said
so many things.. - Yes.
But now the garbage,
the pothole, water problems..
..you will find a solution forthem?
l can do that.
But that won't be right.
No.
lt won't be right.
lt'll be right..
..when the one who is being
paid to clean the garbage cleans it.
Potholes are filled
by those appointed to do it.
Those who are responsible to get..
..the waterto the tap,
fulfill their responsibility.
Whetherthey do it willingly..
.. or out of fear.
lt's your department's
duty to clearthe garbage.
Yes.
Henceforth, if the garbage is not
cleared, it'll end up in your house.
No.
You'll keep your house clean,
won't you?
Yes.
Remember..
..you can't just fill the
potholes of my constituency.
Yes, sir.
And it's not enough that
you just fill the potholes..
No, sir.
Once the potholes are filled it would
be better if they remain that way.
Right!
Yes, sir.
lf you have understood the pain
of suddenly not having water..
..then let's get back to work.
Look. Look. Look.
Good Dharavi.
Clean Dharavi.
Good Dharavi. Clean Dharavi.
Bad photo. Sorry.
Slumdog?
No Slumdog, only bulldog.
Bulldog.
Bulldog.
lt feels like there's still
some hope left in this world.
l think all the politicians
should be like Bhoothnath.
Bhoothnath did what he promised.
Has anyone else done so?
lf such a good job continues
then it won't hurt to pay taxes.
They even cleaned our area.
lt feels good to know that
someone thinks about us as well.
While Bhau only talks,
Bhoothnath does.
You made so many promises!
You don't do anything.
l am... - That Bhoothnath
does everything.
Get lost!
Bhau, people's point
of view is changing.
Then we will change
their point of view.
Potholes are being filled.
Garbage is being cleared.
There is water in the taps.
And the poor are getting
what is rightfully theirs.
And this miracle has been
performed by Mr. Bhoothnath.
Look, please don't
address something that..
..should be done
everyday as a miracle.
l would like to congratulate
Mr. Bhoothnath.
Whatever he has done..
..it cannot be done
by a human being.
And being an ordinary human being..
..l am withdrawing my
nominations from this election.
Mr. Bhoothnath, you win.
Hearty congratulations to you.
But sir..
Look, it's no use
fighting elections..
.. where you are bound to lose.
Mr. Bhoothnath will use his
divine powers and won't let me win.
What are you trying to say?
People will vote for me.
l know that.
But l don't know
where this vote will go.
We have been escaping
booth capturing since so long.
But who will save us from
Bhooth-capturing? (Ghost-capturing)
Bhau, if you would've used even..
..as little as 10%
of your gift of gab..
..and turn it into action
then l wouldn't have to do your job.
lf l didn't fearthe law
l too would've acted like a goon.
What act of hooliganism have l done?
What did you do with those officers?
l did what you should've done.
l don't threaten the
officers to get the job done.
l stay within the
constitution and do my job.
Bhau, the truth is
that you don't do your job.
Water, garbage, potholes..
..these are some of
the very basic issues.
Have you ever done any infrastructure
development in your area?
Have you started schools for kids?
Made jobs available for youth?
What have you done
to control corruption?
How safe are the
women on the streets?
You are changing the topic.
The fact is that
you misused your powers.
lf l have misused it then l've done
so forthe betterment of the people.
lf tomorrow you decide to misuse
your powers for your own good,
then what will anyone be able to do?
Why would l do that?
- Why would you do that?
You've already done that.
And you can still do it.
ln the future if people go against you,
will you tape their mouths as well?
What rubbish is this?
''What rubbish!'' lt's a fact!
Who can stop you from becoming
Hitlerwhile you possess such powers
Look Bhau Sahib,
now you are changing the topic.
No, no, no.
l am not changing the topic.
l am coming to the topic.
lf you really want
to help the people..
..then do so with the power
given to you by the people.
And not with your ghostly powers.
So that you too have the
fear of losing your position.
Do you have the courage?
lf so then let go of your powers
and then let's fight as equals.
Otherwise,
stop pretending to help people.
Can you let go of it?
Can you let go of your power?
You can't, right?
Then it's decided.
Bhau Sahib, you don't need to
take your nomination papers back.
l forfeit my powers right away.
Mr. Bhoothnath?
He's gone.
Bhau played you,
and you easily got played.
Did you leave your brains up there?
People fight for power,
you forfeited your powerto fight!
You are 60 years old
but behave like a 7 year old.
ln spite of doing everything right..
..when people would
question our victory..
..would you like that?
You won't, right?
Yes, but it has reduced
our chances of victory.
Chances have been reduced..
..they are not over.
Put your seat belt on.
The road ahead is bumpy.
You were great, Bhau.
You have ruined
Bhoothnath's future..
.. by making him forfeit his powers.
What will he do now?
He is done for.
Bhau..
- Mr. kriplani is here.
Shall l send him in?
Mr. kriplani..
Will you have something?
No?
What's all this happening
under your rein, Mr. kriplani?
You are the one who is reining.
l just play with the law.
Then make such a move that
the game gets over by halftime.
lt will be done.
Will you have something?
No? lt's okay.
My nomination has been challenged?
Yes, sir.
Bhau has challenged my nomination?
On what basis?
Sir, as perthe rule..
..the person contesting the
election should also be a voter.
And his lawyer has
sent an objection letter..
..stating that a dead
person can't be a voter.
Sorry, sir.
lt is totally my fault.
This is the only point l missed.
Can we do something?
Sir, l can't think
of a way out of it.
lt is a valid objection.
Sorry.
Slowly becoming popular
with the people,
Bhoothnath's election nomination
is now facing a question mark.
Excuse me.
ls Mr. Bhoothnath here?
Later, boss. lt's not a good time.
Hey..
..l had told you about Banku, right?
He is Banku's father.
Sir..
..l heard about you on TV.
l had some information.
l thought l should tell you.
lt perhaps might help you.
lnformation?
What kind of information?
Sir, your death certificate
has still not been issued.
My death certificate
hasn't been issued?
Why?
Because your son
refused to give bribe.
And one more thing, sir.
We're very proud of you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
kriplani..
Bhau...
l always had a desire to see
someone's nomination get disqualified.
ls Mr. Bhoothnath here?
Mr. Bhoothnath?
Mr. Bhoothnath?
Thank you fortelling me. Otherwise
l would've ended up on his lap.
Hello, Mr. Bhoothnath.
l think he is upset with me.
Okay, let's start.
Sir, l always thought
good wins over bad.
But l was wrong.
Sometimes something bad
can end up stopping something bad.
Look, as my son didn't
pay underthe table..
..a corrupt officer didn't
issue my death certificate.
As my death certificate
wasn't issued..
..my name wasn't cancelled
from the voting list.
As my name wasn't cancelled..
..you will be
surprised to hearthis.
Some minister made someone
vote for me during last elections.
Lawyer?
- Yes.
These are some documents
from the election office.
My name is in the voting list.
And as perthe record,
l voted in the last election.
From Madgaon.
Now tell me..
..thanks to a corrupt officer
and a deceitful minister..
..an honest candidate like me
was saved from being disqualified.
Sometimes something bad
can end up doing something good.
Would you like to say something?
Sir, everyone knows that he is dead.
And that he cannot vote.
But that cannot be proved
because he is misusing the rules.
And on that basis he
should be disqualified.
Sir, everyone knows that
he is accused of..
..a number of corruption, murder,
tax, frauds, and malpractices.
But those accusations
couldn't be proved because..
..he also misused the rules.
So according to that..
On that ba..
On that basis..
He too should be disqualified.
What happened, Bhau Sahib?
l think he is upset.
Sir..
Jai Hind.
(Hail Motherland)
Our election office.
This was my father's garage.
Let me introduce you to some people.
Our party workers.
Come in. Don't get scared.
He's a nice ghost.
He is fighting for ourfuture.
Say..
He will win! He will win!
- Bhoothnath will win!
He will win! He will win!
- Bhoothnath will win!
Why don't you vote?
Because all the
ministers are the same.
Whether it's you or Bhau.
What difference does it make?
l am more honest than Bhau.
He becomes invisible
after getting votes.
l'm already invisible.
Where is Mr. Bhootnath?
Over here.
Opposition party's
leaderwants to meet you.
So you want me to join your party.
Why didn't your party make
a candidate stand against Bhau?
The thing is,
we didn't have a candidate like you.
And anyways, our party
never bets on a losing horse.
Tell me something..
..do you have any idea..
..how much money orworkforce
is required forthis election?
No, sir.
l don't know how much black money
is required to win an election.
Or how many goons are required.
Okay. Fine. So,
do you know how many Hindus and..
.. Muslims there are in your area?
How many are from
the backward class?
The thing is,
it is necessary to know that much..
..to manipulate votes, boss.
No. l don't know that as well.
All l know is that my constituency
consists of 100% lndians.
Sir, throw your
principles in the dustbin.
Okay. Fine.
l'm throwing them in the dustbin.
Now tell me,
how should we manipulate votes?
That depends on the
marketing strategy.
Marketing strategy?
- Yes.
All the parties do it.
Assume that there are two
detergent companies in the market.
And both of them claim that
they provide the best whiteness.
So which one will the public choose?
They will choose the
one whose marketing they like.
Okay! Okay! Okay!
There's another benefit in politics.
After buying the detergent even if it
doesn't fulfill the promise it made..
..they have to make do with it forfive years.
- Yes.
And afterfive years,
you can launch a new detergent.
Or re-launch the old detergent.
Like Bhau,
with a new formula,
for more whiteness. Right?
Wonderful.
Wonderful.
You've passed with distinction.
So you think that
l can win this election?
You will win this election
only if you fight it the way..
..it is fought in our country.
The thing is, if honest
people could win elections..
..just by contesting for it..
..then people like us would've
become unemployed long back.
This is the truth, Mr. Bhoothnath.
The thing is,
everyone will come to cheer you up.
But not everyone will come to vote.
This is what has been happening.
And this is what
will continue to happen.
These people make
such a fool of everyone..
..during elections.
Ask him, will he continue
to talk to himself..
..or does he wish to tell
us something?
Will you tell us what happened?
You know why a good
candidate doesn't win?
Let me tell you.
Give me some groundnuts.
l need ten groundnuts.
Five over here. And five over here.
A good candidate loses election
because half of the people don't vote.
And among those who vote..
The one who get
these many votes wins.
That means the one who gets
only 30% votes rules the country.
Because..
Because half of the population
doesn't vote. - They don't.
This is no longer an issue
between Bhau and me.
lt is an issue of every good
candidate in the country.
What should we do..
.. that they too come to vote.
How will we bring about
such a big change?
We'll have to make
people understand.
But who will make them understand.
He is contesting
so he should only do it.
Yes. You will. Who else?
Me?
- Yes.
Anyways, politicians give speeches.
That's when people go
to listen to them.
No, no, no.
Public.. No speeches. No speeches.
l lose my voice
in front of the crowd.
No.
- What are you saying?
l have stage fright.
Stage fright.
What.. what's tight?
What do you have?
l mean..
l cannot speak
in front of a crowd.
That's why l didn't get
any role in school dramas.
Nor did l ever get
a chance to say a speech.
And you are telling us all this now?
After creating such a big drama.
And when you also
need to give a speech.
So what should l do?
Why does he fearwhen
no one can see him?
But l can see them.
Hearthat. Then it's impossible
to bring about a change.
Let's record his voice.
Who will know whether he is talking
or a tape recorder is playing?
Good idea.
We will record your voice.
Leave that, first repairthis.
Hurry up.
l don't have time to waste.
How are you, Akhrot?
Hello, uncle!
Do it!
l have to record in this?
- Yes.
lt's very old.
Yes, it's of your generation.
Hey, you are a champion.
Come on, start talking.
Should l speak here?
Just speak.
What should l say?
What are you doing?
Don't think that you are
talking to a tape recorder.
lt won't come from your heart.
Just think that there is a crowd
standing over here. Just imagine.
You won't feel scared and it will
come from your heart as well.
Where's Bhoothnath?
When will his speech start?
lmagine that the day of your
death has been decided.
And you have been
given three choices.
You can die in any
of these three ways..
..by hanging yourself..
..by coming under a train or..
..by having cyanide.
So, you will think that hanging
yourself is troublesome.
lt will hurt if you
jump in front of a train.
Having cyanide is the best option.
No pain, no trouble, easy death.
This is the dilemma you
face every five years.
ln the form of elections.
Should you vote for someone who
has scammed 2000 crores rupees?
Orthe one who scammed
1000 crores rupees?
Orthe one who scammed
200 crores rupees?
Now compared to 2000 crores rupees
and 1000 crores rupees..
..the one with 200 crores rupees
scam seems honest.
So let's vote for him.
Though he'll loot us but
at least less than others.
Similarly when compared to people
who have committed 15 or 9 murders..
..a person who has committed
2 murders seems honest.
So let's vote for him.
What can we do?
We don't have any other choice.
This is the biggest
problem of our country.
We should vote forthe one
we like the most.
But we vote for
the one we least dislike.
This is not what happens
in Sweden and Finland.
Sweden and Finland are
two great countries in Europe.
This is not what happens there.
There if people don't like
any of the candidates..
..do you know whom do they
give their precious vote to?
They give their precious vote
to theirfavorite cartoon.
Hence Donald Duck is a very
popular leader out there.
So what will happen
if this happens in our country?
From Baliya, Chhota Bheem will win.
From Kanpur, Chacha Chaudhari.
From Nasik, Doremon.
And from Satara, Pokemon.
Unfortunately, in our country,
we are allowed..
..to vote for ministers
but not cartoons.
So, who will you vote for?
Tell me, who will you vote for?
- What happened?
- Nothing, the mic is not working. - Gone.
What happened?
Where did he disappear?
We are here to hear you speak.
What happened?
- Say something..
We can't see him.
Now we can't even hear him.
Did he just run away?
lt's feels good to hear you speak,
Bhoothnath..
Look..
l am not here to
ask you to vote for me.
l am here just to ask you to vote.
lt's okay if you don't want
to vote for Bhoothnath.
lt's okay if you don't
want to vote for Bhau.
Press the ''None
of the above'' button.
But please vote.
So that in future
if Bhoothnath wins..
..those who don't like
Bhoothnath don't feel..
..that Bhoothnath wouldn't have
won if they would've voted.
ln a democracy,
your vote is your voice.
You can make your country listen
to you through your vote.
So speak up. Please.
Say something at least.
Those who don't vote don't
want the country to hearthem.
So it's time to tell them that
if they don't wish to speak..
..if they have nothing to say, then
we won't want to hearthem either.
Sir..
Yes?
- Please explain.
Do you have a Voter lD Card?
No, sir.
l can't hear you.
Speak louder.
l don't have it, sir.
l still cannot hear you.
Speak louder.
Got it, sir.
He understood.
So, it is time to change.
And you have to bring
about this change.
Excuse me,
will you take me to Bandra?
Do you have a Voter lD Card?
No. Why?
Where do you want to go?
Bandra.
- Please speak a little louder.
l can't hear you. Bandra!
- What?
Have you lost your mind?
Taxi!
Mr. Magan, can l have sugar,
two kilos?
l said, l want two kilos of sugar.
Uncle, please give me a packet of biscuit.
- Can't you hear me?
l've been asking for sugar.
Here.
Aunty, first get
a Voter lD Card made.
What are you saying?
Are you crazy?
l cannot hear you.
- Are you deaf?
l love you.
- l can't hear you.
l love you!
l love you.
l can't hear you.
Speak louder.
l can't hear you.
10 rupees.
Speak louder. Louder.
10 rupees.
- Speak louder.
Excuse me, sir!
Sir, your shot is ready, sir
Shot is ready, sir.
Do one thing.
Come here and say it.
Sir.. Shot is ready, sir.
Come here and say it again.
Sir, shot is ready, sir.
Strange.
l can't hearfrom both my ears.
Did you get it ?
Steven Spielberg, have some shame.
Go and get your Voter lD made.
Go.
We have to do overtime
because of Bhoothnath.
What?
Okay, Mr. Tripathi.
Make a card for me as well.
And now from lndia. Ahead
of its parliamentary elections..
..lndia is witnessing a unique movement
in which people are turning a deaf ear..
..towards those who
don't have Voter lDs.
Many are terming this
Movement of Change..
lndia's first non-cooperation
movement since independence.
Don't worry. Bhoothnath
won't win the election.
lt doesn't make a difference whether
Bhoothnath wins or loses.
Worry about the non-cooperation
movement taking place outside.
That's what l am doing.
- Then our party is bound to go down.
And if our party goes down then
you too will lose your career.
Are you getting me?
l understand.
Here. Take it.
Bhoothnath is about to have a big rally
on the last day of campaigning.
l have a great idea.
- Please hear me out.
Do anything to ruin that rally.
Will you be able to do it or should
l give this job to someone else?
l'll do it.
l'm leaving.
- Okay.
Bye.
Okay.
No matter how hard you try
no one lets you change for good.
Looks like it's time
to show ourtrue colors.
lf Bhau wants to win the election..
..then someone will have
to be sacrificed this time as well.
But Bhau, we cannot kill Bhoothnath.
Can we?
Who says we cannot kill Bhoothnath?
Bye.
- Bye, Akhrot.
Get it tomorrow.
- Yes, l'll get it tomorrow.
Akhrot..
Kiddo.. Come here.
Come here.
Please come here.
How are you?
Would you like to have tea?
No?
Look, tell Bhoothnath not
to attend the Change Rally.
You know how Bhau is.
What if l don't tell him?
Then you won't be
able to talk again.
Forever.
Go.
Go.
Rememberwhat l told you.
No rally!
He is like dry dates!
Remember,
tomorrow is a big day for you.
Don't be scared.
Hey..
Are you talking
to me orto yourself?
Why will l feel scared?
l was talking to you.
Mom..
Yes?
l need to talk to you.
So late in the night?
What do you want to say?
Something l have never said before.
l know you keep the fresh
flatbread on top, for me.
And the stale ones at the bottom,
for yourself.
What's wrong, Akhrot?
Let me talk.
l know..
.. from where does a 10 rupee note
land in my pocket every morning.
Sometimes, l come home
late on purpose..
So that from your scolding
l can know how much you love me.
Are you alright?
The fact that you couldn't
send me to school hurts you.
Do you know why l didn't stray?
Because you are very nice, mom.
You are very strong.
Always stay strong.
What are you saying?!
One more thing..
You don't look good when you cry.
Here. Do attend the rally.
Here. Attend the Change Rally.
Here.
Bhoothnath isn't giving in.
He is continuing with
the arrangements.
Here. Come for Change Rally!
Kiddo, where can l find
Mr. Bhoothnath.
ln the rally.
Now we will have a rally for you.
- Come with us.
Come, Bhau will
have a rally for you.
Catch him!
Stop!
- Get him!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Rama, you go there.
Ramesh, you take that lane.
Don't let him get away!
Let's go there!
Come on!
Don't just run blindly!
l'm warning you, Bhau will kill us
if we don't catch hold of the boy!
lt's my fault.
He is just a child.
l should have known.
Please forgive me. lt's my fault.
lt's not yourfault.
They had threatened Akhrot.
But he didn't want you..
..to back out.
Hence he hid it from all of us.
While we were bringing him here..
.. he told me..
''Mom..''
''No battle can be won
without making sacrifices.''
''And if my sacrifice is
needed to win this battle..''
''..then so be it.''
l am not sad.
l am proud of my son.
l won't let him sacrifice
himself so easily.
An attempt should be made.
l'll be back.
Please come back soon.
lt's important.
We have to attend
the Change Rally today.
What l am going to
do is more important.
Any news on Bhoothnath?
We have taught him
such a lesson that..
Don't be surprised.
Like all of you, l too have come..
..to attend Mr.
Bhoothnath's Change Rally.
But is Mr. Bhoothnath here?
He isn't?
Okay, he isn't.
He must be stuck in traffic.
l have to agree..
..Bhoothnath's politics
is of a different level.
He blames and accuses
politicians like us..
..that we disappear after elections.
But he disappeared
before the elections.
Getting influenced by
his sweet talk l had decided..
..that this time l would vote
for Mr.Bhoothnath.
But if he stays disappeared even after
winning then who will do the work?
Who will we blame?
This vacant chair?
lf Bhau doesn't do the job..
.. then you can at least
throw eggs and tomatoes at him.
l am standing right before you.
l haven't gone anywhere.
l am right here.
Your Bhau.
That's why l have changed my mind.
Now, l will vote for Bhau.
You are back?
Tell me, how can l help you?
Sir, l have a request to make.
Please spare that kid's life.
Please, sir.
He doesn't deserve to die.
Well, no one deserves to die.
We sent you down
to prove a small thing.
And you have created
such a big scene.
You became so selfish
in orderto prove yourself..
..that you didn't even
think about other ghosts.
Why did you need to get
into the mess of elections?
You have ridiculed the ghosts.
l.. l have ridiculed ghosts?
l am fighting this
election for myself?
l am selfish? Me?
Yes, sir. l am selfish.
And l am selfish because..
..that's the country l am going
to be born into in future..
..if l can bring about even
a little improvement in it.
Then l will do it.
So that when l am born again,
l open my eyes in a better country.
l am selfish?
Me?
All of you will be
born in this country.
Do you want the same country with
rotten systems, rules and regulations
You too are waiting with a
token in your hand to be born.
What will you gain
by being born there?
When you will grow
up with corrupt people..
..you will end up being corrupt.
When you won't be able
to get yourwork done..
..without the help of bribe seekers
then you will give bribe out of habit.
lf you don't bring
about a change now..
..then your right will be snatched by the wrong
person and you won't be able to do anything.
You won't be able to do anything.
You are talking as if
you have brought a change.
No, sir. No.
l am not saying that.
All l want is..
.. that you give that
kid another chance.
He has dreamt of a better country.
He deserves to see
that dream come true, sir.
Please, sir.
And what if you lose?
l understand, sir.
l understand.
lf l lose, then..
.. that kid has no right to live.
Anyways, what's the use
of him living in a country..
..which doesn't wish
to change for good.
But sir, if l win, then..
.. that kid should
get another chance.
Right, sir?
Okay.
lf you win the election..
.. the kid will live.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
And l..
..l will pray that our man wins.
No, sir.
Pray that our country wins.
Our country.
l will pray that you
think twice before you vote.
Jai Hind!
(Hail Motherland!)
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib!
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib!
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib!
Long live..
- Bhau Sahib!
Long live..
We will win the election, right?
Where..
.. where have you been?
l had gone to beg for Akhrot's life.
We will win the election, right?
Otherwise, Akhrot will
lose his battle against death.
Now..
..l don't know whether
we will win or..
But Bhau has taken full
advantage of your absence.
lt's right, in a way.
Tomorrow is the day of the election.
People think you ran
away from the battlefield.
Under such circumstances
who will vote for us?
And don't think that Bhau
is not doing anything right now.
He will continue to do what
he does during every election.
To win.
Give liquor if you need to.
Shower money if you have to.
And hit them if they act smart.
He will try to bribe those
whose hearts he couldn't win.
Remember Bhau during the elections.
Okay?
Those he can't reason with,
he'll try to influence.
Ganpat, here. Remember Bhau.
Got it?
Those he couldn't influence..
..he will try to influence
them through his agents.
What difference does it make whether
Bhau wins or Bhoothnath does?
Look, l am the one who
gets yourwork done, right?
Then do as l say.
Threaten.
lf, you don't vote for Bhau then..
Got it?
To say, tomorrow will be a new day.
But it will be same
as any other election day.
Half of the people will
convert the official half day..
.. into a full day personal leave.
Picnic!
Bhau's men will gather
people from different places..
..and take them
to the polling booth.
And outside the polling booth..
..underthe pretext of helping
they will keep giving hints.
And they will decrease the
voting speed in your strong areas.
People will vote
in someone else's name.
Because you have done
so much forthe people..
..they will remember you.
But they will vote for Bhau.
Thank you forthe liquor, Bhau.
That's possible.
That's possible.
But it is also possible,
tomorrow brings a morning..
..this country has
never seen before.
lt will be a half day holiday..
.. but people will get to work..
Forthe country..
Uncle.. Wake up, uncle.
You need to go to vote.
You will keep brushing
yourteeth forever?
Don't you want to hurry up?
Ajay..
- Good morning, sir.
Why did you come
here so early today?
Who will go to vote?
Sorry, sir.
People who have decided
not to vote might perhaps..
..might perhaps change their mind.
And those whom they tried to buy,
will tell them..
Lallan..
- Who else is..
That they are not for sale.
Keep this and please leave us alone.
Those whom they tried to influence..
..they'll tell them that they
still have some sense left in them.
Thank you forthe liquor, Bhau.
But sorry.
Anyone who can cast a vote..
.. will vote.
My name is still on the voting list.
Someone else will
vote using my name, sir.
Please let me go, sir.
lt's the question of my future.
And people will cast
votes only on their name.
lf you want to vote using my name
then at least vote for my candidate.
lt is possible that instead
of giving up without a fight..
..people will try to fight and win.
lt is possible that people won't
think that nothing can be done.
They would instead think
that if they do something..
..then perhaps something
good might happen.
People..
.. might come in anyone's vehicle..
But they'll leave with a mark to
ensure the safety of their country.
'Something unprecedented
has happened in this country today.'
'Around 85% of the
people have voted.'
'And the highest percentage of
votes was given in Dharavi, Mumbai.'
'95% of people voted.'
'We will be back tomorrow
morning with the results.'
100% you will win, Bhau.
No one can stop you.
l'm telling you.
Mr. Bhoothnath!
Mr. Bhoothnath?

to do forthe election..

a way only when lndia wins.
