In 1954, half a century ago,
Japan suffered a great disaster.
Godzilla.
Tokyo became a battlefield.
At the sacrifice of our fathers,
we rid ourselves of the monster.
It was the only real battle,
the Self-Defense Force fought
since it was founded in 1954.
Japan has been enjoying peace
for a long time.
But the peril still remains.
A similar monster raided New York
at the end of the last century.
Reports on other monster continue
in from various countries.
That was Godzilla. Right?
They say so in America.
But not in Japan.
Somebody saw the monster.
"Anchors away"
That's all.
Attention! Salute!
A U.S. Nuclear sub in missing.
Change the program schedule.
Prepare for a special bulletin.
Hurry!
To find the nuclear sub that
lost contact off Guam,
the Japanese government decided
to dispatch a search party.
It has a nuclear reactor.
The anti-radioactive sub
"Satsuma" will be used.
A cruiser carrying Satsuma
will leave Yokosuka today,
for the joint salvation operation.
Deep Sea Sub "Satsuma".
We're nearing the target.
An explosion accident.
Strong current!
Sub 2!
What's the damage?
That moving object?
I can't believe my eyes!
Mt. Myoko, Niigata.
The foot of Mt. Myoko is called
a gate to the lost world.
Today we're going to solve
the mystery of,
its legendary monster.
Let's walk into the forbidden land.
What's that?
OK, CUT
Hey, guys! Stop it!
No more shooting!
But, Village Master,
you said we could.
You didn't say it's make-believe.
You said it's a documentary.
It's a report...
All lies!
Your "BS Digital Q" makes only
cheap programs about...
ESP and aliens.
Our Village is attractive because
the villagers are honest.
Go
Village Master. Children like
mystery and monsters.
In America, witches were popular.
They made some villages famous.
Godzilla can too.
It might come here.
He'll bring many tourists.
Are you in charge?
Help!
Don't worry.
What's that?
We're safe.
I'm sorry.
That was tremendous!
May we continue?
Go ahead.
Publicity will attract tourists.
Sure.
- Is the camera safe?
- Yes.
Our village will be famous.
I was interviewed.
You're handsome, Village Master.
Come on, let's go!
They wrecked it!
Watch out, kids!
Drive carefully!
An earthquake?
Stop!
The tunnel collapsed that night.
And there was an earthquake
that night.
But it wasn't recorded.
How come?
It was far away.
The epicenter moved.
What moved?
When it moved,
I heard an eerie voice.
Let me check on it.
I have a hunch.
Yuri.
Our job is the
make cheap fictional shows.
We can make a real documentary.
We have to make good shows
to survive the TV war.
They expect us to make good
low-budget shows.
No real things.
We're above the tunnel
south of Mt. Myoko.
Twenty men were buried alive.
No traffic.
The rescue operation continues.
Tons of rocks block the entrance.
We can't get a look inside.
Raise it.
Forward!
Lift it up. 1,2. Forward.
Lock the D-03 on target.
Fire!
Will it explode from inside?
Can the tunnel stand it?
It's under control.
The witness?
Come with me.
It had a big face - mouth,
eyes, ears, everything!
A living creature?
It was... Godzilla
Godzilla!
I regret I was born a girl.
Why?
You're pretty.
I want to write a shocking report.
Sorry.
Don't say girls can't do it.
Isn't that an excuse?
Who?
You got my message?
Nobody believes that
an epicenter moves.
But...
"Legend of Guardian Monsters."
This is a clue to the incident.
There's an interesting report.
Who's he?
Lake Ikeda, Kagoshima.
Noisy mutt!
Which one is better?
This will do.
Whare you doing? Come here.
Have you picked up stones?
I hate dogs.
No witnesses.
It's exciting. I'm happy to death.
Get rid of the dog. Dump it!
They fell overboard.
Hey! No joking!
What are you doing?
Help!
What's that?
I've brought Yuri home.
Thank you.
No problem.
Dad! I didn't expect you.
Your daughter Yuri is back!
Don't try to be funny.
- She troubled you.
- No
Goodbye.
Be careful.
- You're drunk.
- No, sir!
Drink water and take a bath.
How's work?
Fine.
Anything you don't like?
Nothing.
Although that's a small TV station,
I work with nice people.
Your programs are garbage.
Ignore them.
That young man...
Mr. Takeda?
Boyfriend?
An adviser.
He helps me with my report.
I shoulïve treated him
as your boyfriend.
He isn't.
Besides, the situation was bad.
Sorry.
That's all right.
Eleven young people went missing
at Lake Ikeda yesterday.
Their bodies were in a cocoon.
The group was on a bike trip
from Tokyo.
Beside Lake Ikeda...
Lake Ikeda
Southern Kyushu.
Takamori Saigo went there
after he surrendered office.
It was more than 100 years ago.
Not a coincidence.
Someone predicted people
would die near Mt. Fuji.
Shall we report it?
It's no mere prediction.
Mt. Myoko, Lake Ikeda...
The book is right.
You angry about yesterday?
What?
You know I don't drink.
Why should I get mad about that?
He's sorry he left you behind.
I wanted to take you home.
Really?
You'd have seen hell.
I did.
Don't exaggerate.
He's a tough navy officer.
A stubborn one.
Did you see it with your own eyes?
Yes.
What was that?
The fin of a huge creature.
Godzilla fed on the sub's
nuclear energy.
But who can prove it was Godzilla?
Even if it was,
it raided Japan half a century ago.
Why should it come back?
Why did it choose Japan?
Nobody knows the answer.
We can't say it won't come.
Does it hate Japan?
If we spent too much on defense,
we'd be blamed for wasting money.
Even if it raids us again,
we have advanced weapons now,
far more powerful than before.
"Motosu Police Station."
Yes, he's popular around here.
He lives in the forest and...
is always telling people,
"Godzilla is coming!"
Please come in.
It's him!
You know him?
From Mt. Myoko.
Mt. Myoko in Niigata?
Must be mistaken.
He destroyed an old shrine
and got caught.
Did you see our homepage?
So we got the news.
I'm the station's Webmaster.
The day is coming.
There's not much time left.
Go where Ghidorah sleeps!
Ghidorah?
Wake the 1000 Year Dragon, too.
Maybe they're no match for Godzilla.
In old Japan,
there were monsters:
Baragon, Mothra and Ghidorah...
known as
the eight-headed dragon.
The men who killed them
called them Sacred Beasts.
They worshiped their souls
That were to sleep for 10,000 years.
Ancient Japanese prayed
for the beasts they killed.
Does Ghidorah live here?
After only 2,000 years,
they aren't awake yet.
Ghidorah grows slowly.
If full grown, it's strong.
What's that?
That old man put it here.
How do you know?
Just a hunch.
I feel it.
He touched your hand in the cell.
He meant this stone.
I'm confused.
What?
Gone!
That part... it's gone!
"Magonote, Bonin Islands."
A big typhoon is moving north.
The storm is raging off the Bonins.
We can't dive tomorrow.
What's this?
The old lady of this house said...
The island where
Godzilla landed
fifty years ago is nearby.
Didn't the Defense Army kill it?
It wasn't its fault.
Poor innocent beast!
Make a pet of it.
This ain't no earthquake!
God... zi...
Artillery shells can't kill it.
The prehistoric dinosaur has
survived millions of years.
Even if A-bombs gave it
extraordinary survival,
so far as it's an animal, it's fatal
But no weapons can kill it.
Because it's a compound
of many people's will to survive.
"Will to survive?"
The souls of countless people
who fell victim
to the Pacific War congregated
in Godzilla's body.
Souls?
In its body?
Yuri... You believe this old geezer?
It's not his imagination.
He wrote facts in this book.
One of my wife's relatives
claimed Godzilla hit him.
No interest?
Godzilla is passe.
But continue on with
your investigation.
Why destroy Japan?
Because people have forgotten...
What?
Forgotten the agony of
those killed in the war...
Forgotten their cries...
"Defense Army Information Control."
We're above Magonote.
The village was leveled.
It was a great landslide.
Are there any survivors?
Let's fly low and watch closely.
Hey, I don't remember that hill.
Hill? No!
What's wrong?
We can't avoid it! No a hill!
Mayday!
Come in, Albatross! What's up?
"The earth remembers.
The stones as well."
"Could they speak,
they'd tell many things."
So American Indians said.
Stones might be ancient CDs.
Pressurized granite can be charged.
There may be a way to
make a CD out of stone.
Spirits are made of electricity.
What if it's stuffed in stone...
Could he do it?
Then he released the souls...
from the stone and put them in
the guardian monsters.
What for?
To guard Japan from Godzilla.
It hurts a lot.
Help!
From the analyses of the reports
from the army,
we concluded that
the monster which
destroyed the sub and the island...
was possibly Godzilla.
The government issued a warning
to watch the seas around Japan.
Godzilla's coming!
It's going to kill us all!
Why didn't you tell me, Father?
Tell you what?
About Godzilla.
You know I'm a reporter.
Be proud.
Don't depend only on me.
I have some important information.
"Bonin Islands, Pacific Ocean."
"Battle Cruiser Aizu."
Steady at 20 knots.
Prow area clear.
Report from the Ako: SSE area clear.
Calling from the Wakashio,
we'll search the area
within a radius of 7000 meters.
It's been three days.
No sign of Godzilla.
Some deny the existence of Godzilla.
"Ministry of Defense"
Mothra, Baragon and
Ghidorah
are our guardian gods.
The sacred land is near to
the scene of the accident
Why should gods attack us?
They guard our country.
Its meaning is "homeland,"
not "nation."
Mountains, rivers... Nature itself.
Do you believe that?
The old man's story is believable.
It can't be denied.
Japanese soldiers fought
and died for our country.
Why do they want to destroy Japan?
Many Asian and American
people died, too.
Their spirits joined the Japanese.
I'm back from the Bonins.
Thanks.
My daughter.
The destruction was total.
The government decided
to end our search.
New countermeasures?
We'll keep watching,
But the ministers doubt its existence.
The long-lasting peace
dimmed the terror of Godzilla.
But I vividly remember: Godzilla!
Fifty years ago.
The sky was blood-red...
buildings and railroads trampled...
And a huge, dark figure
slowly advancing
through the flames...
Its face looked like a devil,
furious with hate...
I ran and ran among the crowd
helplessly seeking refuge.
When the terror ended,
my parents were gone,
gone forever.
I've never forgotten...
The wretched cries of the dying.
"Nagano Weather Station."
The observation equipment
functions properly.
Yes, the epicenter.
The epicenter is moving underground!
A new epicenter has been found.
It's still moving south.
Did you issue a warning?
Yes, but they're not ready yet.
Get the general.
I recorded Father's story.
I was moved to tears.
Don't sell it.
You think I'm a bad girl
who resists here father?
You can't make him believe
about the Sacred Beasts.
You don't understand reporters.
Here's more information about
the earthquake in Nagano.
The epicenter is moving...
Epicenter moving?
It started at Niigata and
moved south for Shizuoka.
The Sacred Beasts!
Niigata? Must be Baragon.
Niigate, Lake Ikeda
and Fuji Forest...
Another giant monster,
Different from Godzilla,
is moving underground, right?
Unbelievable!
But the data proves
it's a living being.
It's unbelievable because...
the location exactly
accords with a legend.
"Guardian Sacred Beasts."
You know it? I'm amazed.
A monster was sleeping underground.
It had a horrible face.
It'll wake up any moment now!
Please investigate it instantly.
Why not write it in your homepage?
It's true!
The monster's here.
Godzilla!
Boy, It came again.
According to the scout's report,
The giant monster,
the moving epicenter,
got out of the ground!
Like what?
It looks like Godzilla.
Godzilla?
"Giant monster got out..."
It'll show up at Motosu.
Show up?
The Sacred Beast?
Looks like Godzilla?
The monster is 30 meters long.
Red skin, on all fours,
moving through Gotenba near Mt. Fuji
A red monster? Not Godzilla?
Information from bases are mixed up.
It's different from Godzilla.
Send our fighters from the coast.
Anti-Godzilla plan?
Drop it.
"Yaizu Harbor, Shizuoka."
The red Godzilla is moving...
towards Shizuoka.
We're reaching port.
Uncle.
Red Godzilla is at Gotenba.
Stupid! Godzilla isn't red.
It's coming here.
Get the rope!
What's this?
Look at that!
Godzilla!
Godzilla at Yaizu!
What's at Gotenba?
Which is which?
Unify observations!
We searched everywhere,
but we couldn't find it earlier.
- Army troops, stand by!
- Yes, sir.
Godzilla invaded Shimizu,
and is making its way north.
Fighters and bombs are ready.
Time is short.
Secretary.
The ministers are meeting.
Godzilla's coming!
Evacuate the shop immediately!
Godzilla? So what?
Godzilla...
Let's evacuate. Clean up your desks.
Yes.
An A-bomb?
Yuri.
Not afraid?
I want to see it.
The guardian monsters
might attack us.
- Oh, yes!
- What?
That stone?
In my bag. An amulet?
Godzilla is heading for Hakone Spa.
The ministers are meeting to
determine countermeasures.
Chase the chopper.
We're in a car.
Godzilla is there!
It has come!
I got it!
What?
Where the new monster is going.
What?
It's heading for Godzilla.
Godzilla?
It's near Hakone.
It'll reach Tokyo tomorrow.
We can stop it with artillery
at the Sagami River.
Is it definitely coming to Tokyo?
Its destination is Tokyo,
like the last time.
Why Tokyo again?
Baragon at Hakone.
Are the tourists evacuating?
Owaku Valley, Hakone.
Hey! Look.
Ls a real monster.
Ls frightening, but is cute.
Take a picture before we run.
The monsters will fight.
What?
What a battle!
They're telecasting the fight.
Godzilla is much bigger.
Watch out! Civilians, leave!
The red monster disappeared.
Godzilla looks around.
Where did the red one go?
Tourists are in danger.
That chopper!
They outsmarted us!
That's Godzilla.
It's enormous!
Our guardian monster.
It has no chance.
Godzilla kicks the red monster.
It must hurt a lot.
It never stops assaulting,
I can't shoot anymore.
Don't sympathize with monsters.
- Just do your job!
- Okay.
We're right above Godzilla.
It kicks at its enemy.
The red monster is down.
The red monster is escaping.
The red one climbs up the cliff.
Now's your chance! Get away!
Godzilla's behind you!
Dead...
The men in the chopper. All dead!
Yuri!
Yuri...
Make way! Let us pass!
At present, it's around Hakone,
advancing to the east.
Evacuate the area without
using your cars.
Water might be contaminated...
Your parents?
Are we all going to die?
Don't worry.
People are fighting back.
The guardian monster, too.
The Digital Q mark!
You watch it?
Have you seen the monster?
Our guardian monster
is fighting Godzilla.
We'll be safe.
Believe me.
Let us pass!
Just scratches.
Too dangerous.
The car keys.
No.
Stingy!
It's not your job now.
There's a huge cocoon in Lake Ikeda.
What's that?
The residents and tourists
are gathering.
A huge, mysterious creature...
Like Nessie, was seen here before,
and Mt. Kaimon might erupt.
I want a bicycle, please.
I've none with a basket.
It's handy at a time like this.
This one. Give me a receipt
addressed to BS Digital Q.
- Bridgestone?
- What?
General Migumo, you're in charge
of the counterattack.
I understand, Minister.
This will be the command post.
Dispatch the air squadron.
Roger.
It'll turn to ashes quickly.
Road control is being implemented.
Please follow our instructions.
The lane leading to Tokyo
was changed
into an emergency passage.
No private car is allowed.
Please follow our instructions
when you leave.
The government decided...
...to use the Defense Force
to attack Godzilla.
The order's been issued.
The counterattack operation
has started.
Hello.
Yuri?
Where are you?
I'll chase Godzilla with my camera.
I'll send it via my computer.
Whatever tonight's show is,
change it!
Nobody will watch "The Hot Game".
She's going too far again.
Broadcast a digital camera footage?
Who'll take the responsibility?
I will.
Put the show on next week.
Set it up for live.
And for the Internet, too.
Yuri, give me the real thing!
Be careful!
Okay.
Missiles away!
BS Digital Q, The TV worlïs
trash yard,
proudly presents.
Yuri Tachibana's live report.
"Trash yard?"
Go, Tachibana!
The missiles had no effect.
Hit the target at right angles.
Attack again.
The problem's not the angle.
The plane crashed. The crew died.
What's your next order?
What's that?
Go back to the shore!
Go back!
Hurry!
Did we really get rid
of Godzilla fifty years ago?
I doubted it.
But I taught my men to be proud.
Now look at that!
Godzilla is moving east.
Going to Tokyo?
Fifty years ago...
the first Godzilla was killed,
with an unknown chemical compound.
Nobody knows what it was.
Existing weapons were useless.
The army could do nothing.
People would have cried
for non-armament.
To maintain the military force,
the Ministry of Defense,
has kept is a secret for 50 years.
And so will I.
Is Miss Yuri your daughter?
Yes.
Many innocent people were
killed by Godzilla.
They died in flames in an instant.
People are fighting the monster.
So are other monsters.
They're trying hard to stop Godzilla
Stupid!
Let's protect her.
Arrest her.
A giant insect at Lake Ikeda!
Again!
1000 year Dragon!
Ghidorah?
Will it come?
A new monster's appeared at Mt. Fuji
What's going on here?
Monsters on parade?
The giant insect?
Flying eastward.
To meet Godzilla?
The right direction.
What will happen?
This is unbelievable.
The guardian monsters are
challenging Godzilla again.
Don't attack the guardian monsters.
They're no enemy.
Why don't we name the monsters
so we won't get mixed up?
You sound like
you're enjoying a game.
Sir.
Let me take command.
"Yokohama Defense Line."
Several monsters are gathering
in the country.
We'll call the red one Baragon,
the flying insect Mothra, and
the golden one Ghidorah.
"Patrol Fleet Headquarters."
"Yokohama Garrison Command Post."
Repeat: The red one is Baragon,
the flying insect Mothra,
and the golden one Ghidorah.
The captain's waiting.
It's our
honor to work under your command.
Let's use D-03 drill-warheads.
Load them on the missiles.
Roger!
Shut off gas cocks.
Leave the lights on.
This will aid the military action.
Leave the lights on.
Good luck, soldiers.
Hey! He wishes everyone good luck!
It's a pity to turn this
quiet harbor town into a bloody
lt's been our honor to have
had no experience of combat.
You believe this?
This is the ethic of soldiers
at all times.
Godzilla's here.
Report to the command.
Godzilla's 350 meters away.
It's Godzilla.
Launch a flare.
Mothra...
Don't attack it.
It's Mothra. It's enormously big.
Yuri...
Mothra's coming.
The situation is critical.
Orders?
Not yet!
Troops are waiting for your orders.
No yet. Patience!
Ghidorah!
The guardian monsters are
joining forces against Godzilla!
Move into the bay.
We'll attack from both land and sea.
Move into the bay.
Good timing!
A joint offensive.
We'll attack Godzilla
while it's wounded.
Off limits.
Take cover.
- Go back!
- Wait!
Let go! Let me go!
Let go of me!
Be ready to attack!
All troops ready!
Commence firing!
Commence fire!
Commence fire!
The Ako exploded.
Our ship's damaged
- Report the damage.
- Check the damage.
Guns destroyed!
It's watching us!
Mothra!
1000 Year Dragon!
King Ghidorah!
What's going on?
They're fighting underwater.
Godzilla's wounded.
I'll shoot the D-03 into its wound,
then we'll get a chance.
The launchers are damaged.
Load it on the Satsuma.
Are you crazy?
It's a deep sea sub.
If it's loaded with the D-03,
it can't move fast.
Godzilla's in the sea. Now or never.
I'll go.
Torpedoes?
Two.
Cover me.
Gladly.
He'll attack Godzilla.
Use the remaining firepower
to stop Godzilla.
Admiral Tachibana is off,
to attack Godzilla with the D-03.
If firepower remains,
use it to cover him
and stop Godzilla,
Father?
Let me take you to a safe place.
What's this? Why my father?
He's an admiral. A commander.
Why must he do it himself?
Me or who else?
Father?
Is it okay,
if somebody else risks his life?
Go to the safety zone and stay low.
I've got to do it. It's my job.
Same here. It's the job I have to do
Is there a soldier? Change.
Yes, sir?
Let the lady gather information.
But...
My responsibility.
Roger.
You have permission.
Thank you.
Father.
Good luck.
Promise me you'll come back alive.
I will.
And so you will, too.
Satsuma is ready to go down.
Takeda, run the camera.
On me.
Shoot me.
Okay.
Are you our guardian god, Ghidorah?
Admiral.
Return safely.
The warriors rose...
to beat Godzilla...
with a deep-sea sub.
Nobody knows...
if they can make it.
But I...
want to report...
how they struggle...
to protect Japan regardless
of circumstances...
for our nation's future...
to the very end...
I'll try my very best.
Yuri!
Takeda!
The wound must be warm.
Changed to thermograph.
Drop dead in the mud!
Damn it.
Let go of me. We'll both fall.
I'll save you, by all means!
Takeda...
Damn you!
Admiral!
Escape from Godzilla.
I have the weapon.
Admiral!
Satsuma, please report.
Yuri! Yuri!
Ghidorah lost.
Baragon?
Admiral, don't go!
Pull back!
No!
Admiral!
Admiral...
Sub 3, do you hear me?
Please report the situation.
Father...
Father!
Don't give up!
Yuri! Yuri!
Takeda.
Thank goodness!
Father...
Thanks, Yuri.
Father shot it! He did it!
Godzilla vanished!
Gone from radar!
Possibly exploded!
Sub 1, do you hear me?
Admiral Tachibana
please answer me.
The sub?
He's back.
He's come back!
Satsuma's surfaced.
Admiral Tachibana is alive!
Satsuma's surfaced.
Admiral Tachibana is alive!
Terminate the attack order.
Inform all the units
Godzilla was annihilated.
Atsugi Air Base, cease fire.
Good!
I'm coming, Admiral.
That's right. She belongs to
our company.
Yuri Tachibana.
Yes. Thank you.
Yuri is safe!
That's great.
Okay, let's make a special program.
We've got plenty of stock material.
Insert the professor's
interview, too.
I checked it.
What?
Prof. Isayama was lost
when the first Godzilla came.
50 years ago.
He was 75 years old then.
50 years ago?
Who was the old man?
He's gone from the tape.
You're joking.
- Father!
- Halt!
I haven't checked
my radioactive contamination.
Father.
To make sure.
Stop that. I'm embarrassed.
Yuri
Salute not only me. My friends and...
the Sacred Beasts.
