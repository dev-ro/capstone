I would like, to all mankind
have one neck with my hands
on it.
Carl Pancram: murderer of 23
persons
Belgrade at 80`s. City with
almost 2 million residents,
with few hundred thousand
cars, about a dozen of museums,
two radio stations,
one TV broadcast system
and one big football club.
The capital.
It`s residents for years,wish
so much,that the city,their
own,becomes a metropolis.
At the time when story begins,
are big chances that Belgrade
becomes one of those.
Maybe you wonder, what one city
makes a true metropolis?
Are those traffic jams?Or monster
new blocks?
Or is it constructing
of ultramodern subway system?
(constructing halted)
Some people think that metropolis
is determined by it`s
number of residents.
Belgrade is already for ages a city
of millions.
Others, thus, point the
physical placement of the city.
Belgrade for centuries represents the bridge
between eastern and western civilization.
Notwithstanding, one metropolis is best
determined by it`s chronicals of crimes.
Not worthy wide boulevards,
Not worthy traffic jams and subways,
if at one city there are no
maniacs,the city is simply
not a metropolis.
This a story about extraordinary
happenings,which put
Belgrade head to head with
New York,London,and Paris
All it began benign and
seemed funny.
Get him!
On Belgrade cemetaries began
to appear exhibitionists,
which cross paths the
mourning ladies.
On Kalemegdan started to breed
authentic Belgrade sort of voyers.
Citizens called them Rashomons
according to famous movie of
Akiro Kurosawa,
in which one of the actors is
peeping from the bushes.
Run Zika!
-Again Rashomons.
There were much more serious
examples.
Some Polak stolen money from
the box office of the National theater
and ran away with 65 millions,
although in old currency.
That induced the chain of similar,
but more or less unsuccessful attempts.
This a robbery.
To the two thieves even
firefighters helped to run away.
And then appeared the
Belgrade Phantom.
But he is not a hero of our story,although
he was taking the breath away of Belgraders
with his crazy driving in a
stolen white Porsche
in which night by night was
making crazy the impotent police.
Liftman was one push forward
in developement of Belgrade
on it`s way to be a metropolis.
- Unzip my pants.
It is estimated that he harassed
about 300 Belgrade women,intercepting
them exclusively in elevators.
There is also tragicomic Pavle Siljak,
who, by his handmade pistol,
was shooting at women pass-bys
which were dressed in fur.
There are numerous rapes,murders
of revenge, jealousy
and similar banal motives,
as well as many larger and smaller
heists.
But all of that would not be good enough,
to make Belgrade a metropolis.
For that was needed to be
a king of all criminals,
The STRANGLER.
You don`t like the carnations.
Now you`ve got it.
One likes no carnations,
not deserves to live.
His name was Pera Mitic.He was
48, 120 kilos and his height was
190 centimeters.
He never married.
That was his third victim.
Come in.
Where are the carnations?
You must have been scattered them somewhere.
I`ve sold them all.
-Where is the money? -Here it is.
There were 120 carnations.
Again you have been to confectionery.
You are never satisfied , mommy.
Have u ever sold 120 carnations
in one day?
-Whaat? You raising your voice to
the one who gave you birth?
This is your gratitude, for taking
you to the sea?
Give me the cane.
No, mamma, please. -Cane,
or to lock you in the tank.
Nooo, pls no tank. -How you will
respect your close ones,
when you do not respect your own mother?
Kneel on seeds,you naughty one!
Alright mom, just dont yell.
That is giving me headaches.
Sure it hurts, `cause you were
laying with the Sun upon you up to the
15 hours during the last summer!
Moms scolds because of
late returnings home
were getting Pera back to normal condition
but was bothering him all over again,
because he never could recall
what was happening before.
How has Pera started to STRANGLE
(flashback)
His first victim,
Pera strangled just few nights before.
That breaking night he was
selling carnations on Belgrade taverns.
But in time of our story,
carnations became obsolete.
Girls sometimes not allowed boys
to buy them flowers,
so therefore Pera
was bringing home less money
and had to sustain
horrifying moms reprimands.
Give me five flowers. -I`m most thankful,
precious madam.
Thank you very much.
Here you are, wonderful
red carnations, 50 dinars each.
Do you have roses? Carnations stink to me.
-We dont have.
Here you are,
wonderful red carnations.
Sir, here you are,
for the lady.
You want one? -Stop kidding with me.
-Please take. They are so fresh.
They have been taken today. Look,
how they are red. Like blood.
Never mention flowers and blood together.
Give me five.
I don`t want.I hate flowers.
Men think they can settle
everything with it.
Flowers enriches the life.
I don`t need money.
It`s my present. -Leave me alone.
I told you,that I dont want flowers,
especially carnations!
Some girls were so extreme,
that carnations
not wanted to take even for free from Pera.
Those girls he decided to punish.
-And you call yourselves the ''flower people''.
He still not knew,how will do that,
but he felt so big urge,
to persuade those girls,
that carnations are wonderful flowers,
which all must love.
You want I sleep over at yours?
-I`m not in the mood tonight. Ciao!
Bad karma.
Lady, please sit.
-Just you sit oldie.
Pera`s big problem was extreme exhaustion.
Hey, fatty!Hey!
The last stop!
Excuse me.
Because of so much walking from one tavern
to another,he barely could stand.
What`s the matter with you?
Why are you upset `cause one stupid florist?
Go down, show him that you are not afraid.
Again you dropped out the carnations.
-Noo.
Here you are! -Noo.
-For every single carnation! -Noo.
What do you want? -Ah,no.
-Why are you following me? -Noo, noo.
Go away, or I will call the police!
-Noo.
And that`s how, thanks to the one brave
and the arogant girl,
Pera Mitic became a criminal.
His next victim, Pera strangled
already next night.
Before that, he first went to
his favorite confectionery
to eat cream-pie .
Good evening, miss Dobrila.
-Good evening ,uncle Pera.
You should change water
more often.
Look how are they faded.
Carnations are very sensitive flowers.
And why are you so fancy dressed tonight,
like you are going to a ball?
To opera.
I`ve never been to opera.
You won`t sell all those flowers there, right?
-People who like opera,
are buying flowers.
Thats why I love opera.
Tomorrow at 5.20 AM,is waiting
white Mercedes in front of a hotel.
Wake up service is ordered at 4.20.
Ticket is in the passport.
At the airport will be two men
to take care of your luggage.
I`ve said hundred times I dont
want carnations in my dressing room!
I hate their smell!
What do YOU want?
AGAIN carnations! OUT!
How Pera started to strangle
(end of flashback)
One murder can be act of some amateur.
With the second murder, Pera Mitic
gave the possibility
to Belgrade to finally gets a real
strangler and to become a metropolis.
Off to bed, you punk!
You`ve been driftin` all night long,
instead you should learn
all gospel by heart.
You more like to exterminate cream-pies!
-Let`s back to the third murder.
Because just on that moment
made people to start questioning:
Is it true that appeared
authentic Belgrade strangler?
Those are all rumours,
no need to start panic.
Don`t disturb the public.
Honourable spectators,
any panic is unreasonable.
There are no any indications that is a case
of some sort of a strangler.
Isn`t it strange to you, that
only in last few days,
has been murdered few persons, all three women?
-Let the police do it`s work
on peace. -Wait. . .
-Turn the camera off. Jovanovic!
Confiscate the cam! Off you go!
The sight of the strangled girl
disturbed the residents of the capital,
and especially lonely
young man Spiridon Kopicl,
talented, but not still a
distinguished rock musician.
Shpira, what is it?
- He choked.
Throw out, Shpeery.
-Not like that.This way.
Dobrica! - Son! Sonny?
Huh, seems I squeezed too much.
Quick,forced respiration.
Mouth to mouth.
Spiridon was extremely
shy young man.
Maybe to that contributed
his unusual family situation.
After death of Spiridon`s mother
Marija Kopicl, his father,
well known psychiatrist and court expert,
married a beautiful nurse Natalija.
Because of all that young Spiridon
hated all pretty women.
He is alive! Shpeery is a alive!
Shpira! What is it?
Are you crazy? Shpira!
Kid is in a state of shock.
-Strangler. He ordered me.
Dad, I am spiritually connected with
the strangler.Is it possible ?
If you love, Carmen,
like I do love you,
encourage me in fight,
i will be, the pride of yours.
Your love, gives the strenght.
-You well know, Escamillo,
How much i love you.
I could never imagine,
how much my heart is aching.
-Mom,it bursts, not into the eyes.
Late Pospisilovic
so nice was singing that aria.
Hum mom,dad was also singing along
with you when was alive? -Sure.
Every Friday we were putting you
in a bath and we sang together.
I loove you, love you sooo much.
Mom, why kids teased me,
that you don`t know who is my father?
Jesus, which dog said that?
-Jovica, Ljilja, Mirko, Zorica.
Shush, unfortunate son! I would
strangle them with my own hands,
just when I get them.
Enough rampage!
Little bit relaxed.
You always want to be rebellious.
-You think, you are really smart,
don`t you?
Yeah, yeah. -Enough quarrel.
Lets play. -We won`t play,
until we dont know, what we are playing.
We have perfect mediabusting project,
and you behaving like a savage.
-Multimedial, ha?
I always loved you four-eyed pricks.
-Fuck it.
You need to make more words and to
get into the state of mind of a strangler.
Really it was, thinking of the new words,
Spiridon was roaming thru the city
imagining strangling women.
This girl is prettiest, this girl,
of which I`m thinking of now.
This girl is the only one,
which I love.
Once you meet girl like that,
don`t miss a chance.
Touch her on a shoulder
and say to her now:
Baybe, baybe, close your eyes now,
Baybe, baybe, close eyes of yours ,
here comes the kiss.
Whole life he was searching for her,
whole life he was waiting for her,
now he squeezing his arms around
her neck and whispers:
Baybe, baybe, close your eyes now,
Baybe, baybe, close eyes of yours,
here comes the kiss.
Please, let me listen the song
to the end, pleease.
Since when you like rock, uncle Pera?
You are for ages an opera fan.
A man is learning as long he lives.
Me too.
Her body is now still,
her lips won`t say anything else,
he is holding her in his arms,
she is all his.
Where have you found THAT song
to learn rock?
For me that is sick. All together.
Well, you see, to me those young
people are very interesting.
Oh please, they`re singin` about
some maniac, who strangles women,
like he is some idol, hero, whatever
-Don`t be like that, miss Dobrila.
What do we know, what kind of man is he?
You see, I`ve been thinking.
Why would someone like him,
kill all those poor girls?
There must be some reason.
-What reason? He is simply a fruitcake.
Why you are so pushy, madman, madman?
Like we are all normal.
FEW HOURS LATER
AT THE OTHER END OF A CITY
I saw him! It is a strangler!
Police!Police!  Strangler!
Sir, who will pay for my wasted time?
I have a plenty of work at home,
waiting for me.
I`m sitting here wasting my time,
waiting for someone to speak to me.
Comrade Mojsilovic, I am
inspector Ognjen Strahinjic(Brave).
I hope, that you will be useful.
-And I want to help.
Only, seems here no one cares,
that I saw the strangler.
And, you saw him well ? -Call me not
Mica Mojsilovic, if I not saw him well.
Aand, you are quite sure you
would recognize him?
-Phew, absolutely.
Our men put in custody 20 suspicious,
which were near the site of the crime.
Your part is,
to look them very well.
If you are absolutely sure,
that is among them
the man you saw,you will give me
a secret sign by shaking you head.
And what if he sees me?
-That is out of the question.
The lamps will blind them,
and I am with u.
And? Who`s gonna pay me that?
-Comrade Mojsilovic, it is ur
obligation as a citizen.
Yeah right? And you get salary for that.
Dont fuck with me. I`m not born yesterday.
Very well comrade, you gonna cooperate or what?
- There is no anything but money.
5 ''horses''(50 dinars) right now,
and we do business.
It is torn.
Is it now OK?
Yeah. Ride on, ban Strahinja(BRAVEY)
Your fish&chips, comrade inspector..
-Thank you.
Let in the first group!
Heee,hee
from where you dug out that hunchback?
What person can he strangle?
You dont know shit.Ouuu....
If is all police like this,
that one would strangle half of Belgrade,
if I not noticed him.
-Please, be discreete.
That is in your own interest.
Next.
Don`t fool me up for a smallchange.
That man is enormous.
Take away those misfortunes.
Let them go to sleep.
Are you quite sure that is not one of those ones?
-Come on man, are you out of your brain?
They are not capable to strangle a fly.
Bring 5 big ones!
Mr.policemen, I never split
up with my basket of carnations.
How will madam recognize me without my basket?
Shush! Shut up, you fool!
-Please. Thank you.
What is it with you? Why you are shaking?
-Secret sign, bravey.
Secret sign?
SEPARATE HIM!
We finally got him.
What is it with you? I am only without a basket.
-Not him.
This is Pera the florist.You must
know him. Not him.
There you are.Madam recognized me.
She loves carnations.
Then why you were shaking head
comrade Mojsilovic?
-`cause that bold one up there.
He is murderer for sure.
He is horrible. -You recognize him?
Sure. Im` not blind.
HE IS THE MURDERER!HE IS THE STRANGLER!
If need to,I will sign that.
-Jovanovic.
Take from comrade 50.000 old dinars.
Markovic, go dress the uniform.
Noone that night was sad and lonely
as inspector Strahinjic.
All his efforts, to find a
missing link in a row of murders
or to find the common motive,
which could point to the possible murderer,
remained unsuccessful.
Public pressure
was stronger every day.
More often inspector
saw underestimating grins
of his young associates.
He knew the rumours,
that came his time to retire.
That`s why this was his last chance,
to restore his disputed reputation.
Hello, devoted listeners,
again you are with us
on our frequent waves.
With us is Spiridon Kopicl,- Kopeecl-
singer of controversial ''Symbols''.
Those days their`s ''Belgrade strangler''
made big fuss,
I would say more `cause bizzare lyrics
than it`s music.
Let us ask Spiridon, what will
happen on the next concert of
''Symbols'' in the ''brewery''?
Will girls feel safe in that
girlhating horror atmopshere? And
why concert was scheduled on Friday,and 13th ?
Strangler will be for sure on concert,
i assure you that.
Because it is his song,
in some sort of a way .
What do you have against the girls?
And why is the strangler
so interesting to you, that you
dedicated him one song?
Have you ever tried to strangle one?
-Heh, no.
I had no chance.
To be close to touch their neck.
They dont want to close their eyes.
-Let us give you the oportunity.
Well, I am not afraid of men,
try to touch my neck.
I will close my eyes too.
Dear listeners, now you will attend
to the exclusive broadcast
of one strangulation. How do you feel?
Do you want to strangle me? -Yes.yes.YES!
Where are you going? Who gave
you the licence, you idiot!
Give the headset, to I call the police!
-I AM the police!
Phone call!
Its not funny at all.
Yes? Rock-o-lada, we are listening.
Inspector Ognjen
Strahinjic speaking. What are
you doing there in Rock-o-lada?
What do you think is your duty, ha?
On the show,
which listens so many youths,
you celebrate this meaningless song,
which is supporting the crime.
You are the one bunch of maniacs
which,will I. . .
That was the was the most extraordinary
experience in my whole life.
You are totally out of your mind.
Let the closing theme.
Wait, to explain to you.
Dont call me Ognjen Strahinjic,
if I let you to hold on that concert!
Concert? Why not?
Hello,urgently gather the 20
female agents ! Yes!
Overwhelmed  with a pile,
seemed to him, hard-solving problems
Spiridon was roaming thru the city.
Incident on the radio
started up an avalanche of questions ,
which were demanding answers.
Obsessed with the strangler
and impatiently waiting for a concert
Spiridon was asking himself:
Who am I?
Where I am from ? To where I am going ?
what is that which cant be explained
is linking me with this man,
who strangles the women?
Sometimes is seemed to me
that I`m only an instrument
in the hands of some strange force.
Sometimes I think , that I am him.
I AM SPIRIDON KOPICL!
I AM JUST AN ORDINARY GUY!
I AM NORMAL! I am in love.
Girls, hard work is in front of us.
In this city maniacs are growing
like grass after the rain.
My presumption is,
that this concert will act on them
like antifly glue.
Rodoljub, is that you?
-Comrade inspector we`ve not managed
to found 20 women,
so I put myself on the line of duty.
-Not bad.Not bad at all.
Finally some use of your movie
ideas. But be careful.
Maniacs  are crazy, but not stupid.
Don`t forget,
its not enough to disguise as a woman,
you must behave as one.
UNDERSTOOD! -You understood nothing.
You must enter completely into the
female character,
take over the women psyche,
all the time you must repeat:
I am woman.
I am woman.I am woman.I am woman.
I am woman.I am woman.I am woman.
FRIDAY and the 13th
Hey whats up ? What are you doing ?
Why you are so stiff?
Mingle, dance, sing. -Understood.
You are woman!- I am woman.
Baybe,baybe do you wanna dance?
Fuck off, phony.
I always dance alone.
Watch out, tall!
-Hey little one, be good.
Beat it, you faggot!
Fresh red carnation for a girlie?
-I shit on your carnations !
Spread on the streets
and play lone girls.
Go!
This evening all were so kind.
All were buying carnations,
except you.
My last carnation to end like this.
This boy is not normal.
Sleep calm,dream of ''Symbols''
and Belgrade strangler.
YOUNG KOPICL
MAYBE A KILLER?
Over, Dove 12.
Over.
Are you on the spot? -As combined,
comrade inspector.
Mind your behaviour. You never
know if you have been watched.
Do not understimate any pass-byes.
Anyone can easily be the killer.
And be smart. -Understood.
Dove !
Hey! Where are you going?
Ah, eh, is there some party?
- Maybe u want some hardy.
Want some beer? -Why not?
Eh,I told you, that I dont like that.
...................-COPS!
Over, Golobica 12.
-Is there something new?
Nothing. Just to jerks,
almost raped me.
Excellent, just go on.
You are the only one so far
which got attention of men,
other doves dont have any news.
Keep repeating,
I am woman. Get it?
I am woman.I am woman.
I am a  MAN.
I......I am a man..
Maamma!
Dove 12, confirm.
Dove, speak out.
Rodoljub, what is it with you?
Speak out!
Dove 12, speak out!
Dove 12, confirm!
Quick, on position 12.
To all doves!
Goshawk attacked dove
12. All go to her nest.
What is it, What`s wrong tonight?
Like all went mad.
Sure is strangler again in the action.
-Pls Shpira, stop bother me with that story.
It`s totally inapropriate. I admit,
your music is good.
But your image is totally cretenic.
-What image?
What you think, that the thing
on a radio was a joke?
You and me were in  paranormal
contact with the strangler.
Hey, now you are really bothering me.
Go home, and then choke your dad
with that puberty madness.
- Look in the morning papers tomorrow,
then you will see what is puberty madness.
Get him on the right, Milojka!
Easy, George. Easy.
Oggy brought you fish.
Here you are, fish for Georgy.
Eat well. Maybe it is our last supper.
Death  of Rodoljub Jovanovic
was the hardest blow
in the entire career of
Ognjen Strahinjic.
Whole his investigation concept
collapsed like a card building.
In his mind were echoing words
of his closest associate:
Comrade Strahinjic,
isn`t it obvious to you,
that is actually a mass murderer,
a psychopat. All evidence lead to that.
All victims are women.
All women were wearing pants.
Not on single one were traces
of sexual intercourse.
All were strangled by fingers of a
strong man without any means.
So what?
If we catch that maniac,
we can get into the history of world
criminal chronicles.
Sense of guilt of
Rodoljub`s death
was tearing apart
inspector Strahinjic.
It seemed to him ,
that life has no meaning anymore.
Dissapointed, shaken and desponded
he decided to commit a suicide.
Good bye, George.
Maybe is somewhere out there,
better and prettier world,
in which we will meet again.
Tomcat George: Don`t do it Oggy.
The society needs you.
Who will avenge Rodoljub?
Strangler must be stopped.
And that only you can do !
You are right, George.
Thats what would Rodoljub say.
If I disapointed him,
while he was alive, I won`t now,
when he is dead.
My clever George.
From now on, begins the new
life of Ognjen Strahinjic.
As usual Pera Mitic also this time
has not been remembering
the previous events: Friday and 13th
for him like not existed at all.
Only, at the place where he woke up
he knew
that he again messed something up
and expecting him mother`s scolds.
Oh my dear God! Sofkie, I told you hundred
times not to go naked around.
I apologize dad.
-Hello, hello? -I only wanted to recommend you
to watch my story about your concert
on tonights Cultural mosaic.
Maybe it will help you
to solve some of your problems.
And yes.-Hello?
-You dont need to buy todays newspapers,
there is nothing about the strangler.Ciao.
Pump! -Just a second,
mommy, to I see this singer.
I so much like this song.
-Pump, as I tell you!
Little quiet, mommy, at least
to hear my favorite song.
Better listen the song of God,
you punk!
Mommy,little more quiet,
please! Mamma!
Belgrade mods offered us
their new style.
Even since Sex Pistols
and late Sid Vicious
evil became popular trend.
As always, with delay, our
pseudoavantguard
rockers are offering us,
their version of other people
ideas. After nazipunk
and serbian national caps
arogant leader of  ''Symbols''
Spiridon Kopicl offerin` super
news: strangulation of women.
That, the one real  maniac
endangers living of  Belgrade women,
just entertains the ''Symbols''
giving spicy taste
to their morbid image. What
Spiridon has against the women?
Women are...
Let we listen once more that
fluent statement.
Unfortunately our audience
fall to those bizarre ideas,
with which Kopicl and people
similar to him are hiding
their own artistic impotence.
''Brewery'' was crowded this time,
everyone had great time,
probably not thinking
of implications. The girls were buying
red carnations
like they attending  March 8th(womens day),
and not to their own burial service.
Anyway, let`s look, what the cameras
recorded on this concert.
Oh, that is me. That`s me!
Mom, it`s me!
Mommy, i remembered.
I was on the concert.
I have sold all the carnations.
Look, mamma!
I am on the concert. That is me!
Mom, my head terriblly hurts.
Mommy, my head hurts,
play something for me.
Play, mamma, please.
I have terrible headache.I will pump.
Sing, mamma,sing.
Sing something for me, mamma.
You have nice voice.
Pera, son, you are sick.
I am sick, my head hurts.
I am sick, soo haard.
Shpira, I brought to you
milky rice.
For God sake Shpeery,until when
you will play with that terrible doll?
I`m sure that many girls would like
to be instead of her there.
I`ve told you hundred times,
that do not enter my room
without knocking.
Aah, you will all see,
who is Spiridon Kopicl.
I will show you,
who is impotent.
Torn apart with contradictory feelings,
provoked by Sofija`s report
Spiridon is on a brink of despare.
He feels that need to do something,
but he doesnt know what to do.
Like in some trance he decides,
to directly get involved
in the happenings.
He is taking scissors and starting
to cut letters from the newspapers.
At the beginning it seemed
like he wants to compose
the anonymous love letter.
But letter, started to be as
letter to host of Rock-o-lada,
it turned to be a letter to the
inspector Ognjen Strahinjic.
"Next one will strangle in Friday.
The strangler."
Finally we have something concrete
in our hands.
Killer became arogant,
encouraged
and according to that become negligent.
We have
three days to prepare.
This time must not be mistakes.
I think, that this letter has
nothing to do with our case.
This was sent buy some fool.
-Mitrovic!
You not yet overtaken this case.
You think that i dont know,
that you working behind my back?
But this action
you wont undermine!
Strangler was, last friday,
attacked on friday.
There is no reason why he would not
repeat that,
according to his announcement.
That`s why you are all free till morning.
Sleep well and prepare for hard work,
which is in front of us.
And what if, strangler with his letter
just wanted to trick us?
Mitrovic, dont fudge the sticks
into my wheels,
and let me on peace to make plan
of the action. If I dismissed you,
that doesn`t mean I won`t stay awake.
And now, off you go!
I have nothing to lean on.
That man is killing without any reason.
In this city hundreds of women
are wearing pants.
How to I anticipate,
who will be the next victim?
We are listening extraordinary Johnny Stulic
and his hit ''Going into the night''.
Dear listeners,Rock-o-lada is calling you
to tell about your requests.
Our phone is still
656-353.
And now only Johnny Stulic
and ''Oh my God, what an awful movie''.
You got call.
Yes?
Rock-o-lada, we are at your sevice.
What do you have against my carnations?
- Pardon me?
What are you talking about?
You know what I`m talkin about.
You were recording me for TV.
You were critisizing my carnations.
That is not polite.
I dont like girls,
who hate carnations.
I really dont like carnations,
but please turn volume down on your radio,
we have strong interference.
Those are not interference,
that is me eating cream-pies.
You know, beside carnations,
I so much like to eat cream-pies.
And I would like to listen
my favorite composition,
Belgrade strangler.
-Rock-o-lada fulfill wishes
only to those listeners,
which introduce themselves.
it is not nice of you, to critisize
on TV. I know,
that you are doing `cause your career,
but that was not clever from you.
Please, introduce yourself.
-I...WONT. -Dear listeners,
I dont know what you think of,
but seems to me,
is the one of those childish
jokes of Spiridon Kopicl.
But because he so much like his tune,
we will fulfill now his request.
The last time in Rock-o-lada,
The Belgrade strangler.
Comrade inspector.
Down is one murdered girl.
-What does she wants?
Colleague wants to say,
that she is dead.
What has to do with me?
It is again one of the strangler`s victims,
comrade inspector.
It`s not true. What do you know?
All you, want to be the inspectors.
That`s not true!
It can`t be!It wont do!
Strangler would not lie to me!
Strangler would not lie to me.
Strangler would not lie to me.
Just need to let him,
to let out his agression.
All those murders, contradictory hypothesis,idee fix
about some strangler
caused in him internal tension.
He just need some exhaust, it`s so obvious.
How he will even behave when finds out
that he is taken off the case?
No way.No way.In this delicate moment
he must not find that out. Not at all.
His state of mind is on edge of normality.
When he gets out he will be quiet as ladybug.
I need panthers, not ladybugs.
-Well he is certainly not capable
to handle that case,
is very important to him,
to he thinks he still have the case.
That is crucial thing for his recovery.
For God sake Dobrica, how do I manage that?
We are not theater group to play for him.
I dont know. Depends, how much do u care
about seeing him healthy again.
But watch out.Another hard blow like this,
and he definitely will be staying here.
Here you are, take a seat.
Take a seat. You are free to go.
Some refreshment,orange juice?
-Thank you, you are most kind.
Here you are.
That juice is excellent.
Where have you bought it?
Ognjen? -Yes Gane, please?
-Ognjen...Ognjen, how do you feel?
Excellent.Excellent, like a panther,
ready for a jump.
Tonight we will get him,
dont worry , comrade Gane.
Little before I was thinking about it,
and i not found any fault in entire plan.
I apologize, too much work to be done.
if you dont mind,
I would not stay here any further.
Excuse me. -You just go for your work.
My shauffer will drop you by.
You escort the inspector,
while I make a phone call.
Follow that one on rollers.
YOUNG KOPICL MURDERER?
Why you hung up on me, you idiot?
Go to your mom and gasp!
That guy calling me 5th time already today.
This happens when you want to be a TV star.
-You know to choke me.
Baybe, baybe, close your eyes.
13.05
Strangler searching for a pray.
Uncle, uncle, your flowers scattered.
-It`s nothing, no problem.
Are you a boy or a girl?
-Girl. My name is Sofija.
Why then you are wearing pants?
-Because I like.
That`s not nice. Girls
need to wear dresses
and to love flowers.
Here , i will give you one carnation.
I dont like carnations.
You are one naughty girl.
-Sofija! Sofija?
Where are you? What are you doing here?
-Dad, my ball escaped.
You must be good, Sofija.
Sofija, Sofija. That name echoed
in the head of Pera Mitic.
He just couldn`t remember,
why that name is important to him.
And then he remembered that exists,
the other Sofija.
Sophy baby,Sofija, you got a phone call.
-Oh it must be again that pain in the ass.
Tell him that I moved.
Hello? Sofija don`t live here anymore.
She moved.
Hello, comrade Gane? Djoka is here.
Uff, all day I am with him,
he is following up some brat.
I dont know, dont know what to do with him.
Excellent.Excellent.
Just let him follow him.
The longer, the better.
And dont bring him here,
if you not need to.
Very well. Let him amuse himself
till morning if wants.
So long.
Look comrade Gane.Just like I said.
Fingerprints from the fork in the confectionery
are exactly the same as on the bag of
one of the strangled girls.
It is obvious, that killer is the same guy.
Also is obvious,
that letter has nothing to do with it.
Neither are four first strangulations
were announced
nor murder in confectionery
matches with announcement in letter.
It is obvious that letter was sent
by some charlatan.-And totally made crazy
poor Ognjen. -I claim,
that the letter is total nonsense
and no murder will happen tonight.
Hey, wait, what are you doing?
-You are not up to my sleeves, kid.
STOP!....STOP!
You think that I am crazy?
You are still not aware,
who is Ognjen Strahinjic!
The Strangler!
Mamma!
Sofija....Sofija...Sofija
Shpiro.
You saved my life.
Kissing the Spiridon`s lips,
from which was pouring Pera`s
blood, Sofija realized,
that her future lies
in Spiridon`s arms.
She could not even dream of,
how much she was right.
You and your`s carnations.
Look what you have done.
They are more important tou you
than my health.
How will I marry now,
without an ear?
Which girl will want me like this?
Mommy,
help me to find a new ear.
My ear.
You found it, mama.
Dear spectators,
the ear, which are you looking at,
before belonged to the strangler,
and now it belongs to us.
Tell us, could you see well the attacker?
-I think that is totally one insane man.
Dangerous sex maniac.
Mama,
why am I a sex maniac?
Who is to whom bite ear?
Me to them or they to me?
why are youy laughing?
What is so funny?
Tell them,
to give me back my ear.
STOP LAUGHING! I`ve had enough of
you and your television set!
I will all lock you up in the tank!
EPILOGUE
According to orthodox customs of wedding,
which are in respect
to Sofija`s good father attended
highest church representatives,
Spiridon carried
Sofija over the doorstep.
Sofija, all in her love ecstasy,
could not even imagine
that this night of passion is also
a breaking night.
Misterious paranormal
string,which connected destinies
of Pera Mitic, Spiridon
and inspector Strahinjic,
was threatening, to mix into twisted
clew of crime that never can be untangled.
That very same night ,after being backed to duty,
inspector Strahinjic,
pleased with recent happenings,
is informing his tomcat about the news.
What a hard day is behind me.
My George.
Noone can understood,
that us in our country
need to develop our own methodology.
Our methods
need to differ
from the methods of other`s police.
This ear will place us
into the history of criminology.
My George, it will lead us
directly to Belgrade strangler.
NOOOO!
In that moment, when George ate his ear,
Pera Mitic yelled in pain.
In dream, mother`s image came to him.
Pera, my son, don`t worry,
your mom will bring back your ear.
At once I am going to that
evil singer to ask him, where is your ear.
Pera, my son, don`t worry,
your mom will bring back your ear.
At once I am going to that
evil singer to ask him, where is your ear.
Disguised,in mom`s clothing
with make up and with a wig on it`s head
Pera is going on a quest for his ear.
Spiridon was on end of his strenght,
when on his room window
appeared face of Pera Mitic.
I will strangle you!
I WILL STRANGLE YOU!
Ah, there you are!
At nervous breakdown
inspector Strahinjic
after long hunt finally succeeds
to catch his tomcat and to strangle him.
On that moment in Spiridon something has broken.
I am dying!- Die finally! Look,
what is she doing to Shpira.
- Let the kids!This is their
first wedding night. -If it is first,
not need to be the last.
Ah, has Belgrade need to be
battlefield of the most morbid,
and in the same time
most incredible story of crime of the 80`s?
Bring back ear to my son!
Heelp! Daad! Strangler!
Open, Dad! -You just bite!
And then my son is a maniac!
-Police! Heelp!
Strangler!
Get back the ear, you punk!
My son is not a maniac.
Give back the ear!
My son is not a maniac
you punk.
I will show you.
I will find you.
You will return Pera`s ear.
Give ear!
On that moment, when Pera Mitic
ripped off his ear,
in  Spiridon`s mind
finally crystalized the chords
of his first symphony,
which will few years later
make him a famous composer.
Known as a man, who saved
Belgrade from the strangler,
Spiridon lived as esteemed
citizen and recognized artist.
Sofija Mackic was declared
as a last victim of Pera Mitic,
which she eventually has been.
Sudden death, which Dobrica Kopicl
cought in a wedding bed,
left Spiridon to concern and take care of
mourning stepmother Natalija.
Premier play
of his first symphony
under authors directing
was broadcasted on TV,
so he could be seen
by a millions of spectators.
The only ones, who could tell
some more about
a making of Spiridon`s
ingenious work
were unfortunate
inspector Strahinjic. . .
George!George! Now I am totally sure.
Young Kopicl is the strangler.
And the corps of Pera`s mother,
forgotten in tank
in front of ,once for all,
turned off  television set.
That`s what life is.
Some stranglers are born under
lucky star, others are not.
All characters and events shown in this movie
are fictional and therefore every coincidence
with reality is completely accidental.
