- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Mom.
Sleep tight, kiddo.

All right, Mr Bile, is it?
Uh, my friends call me Phlegm.
Uh-huh. Mr Bile, can you tell me
what you did wrong?
- I fell down?
- No, no, before that.
Can anyone tell me
Mr Bile's big mistake?
Anyone?
Let's take a look at the tape.
Here we go.
Uh, right...
buh, buh, buh, buh... Ah, there.
See? The door.
You left it wide open.
And leaving the door open
is the worst mistake...
any employee can make because...
Um, it could let in a draught?
It could let in a child!
Oh, Mr Waternoose!
There's nothing more toxic or deadly
than a human child.
A single touch could kill you.
Leave a door open and a child
could walk right into this factory...
right into the monster world.
I won't go in a kid's room!
You can't make me!
You're going in there
because we need this.
Our city is counting on you
to collect those children's screams.
Without scream, we have no power.
Yes, it's dangerous work, and that's why
I need you to be at your best.
I need scarers who are confident,
tenacious, tough, intimidating.
I need scarers like... like...
James P. Sullivan.
Hey, good morning, Monstropolis. It's
now five after the hour of 6:00 a.m...
in the big monster city.
Temperature's a balmy 65 degrees,
which is good news for you reptiles...
and it looks like it's gonna be
a perfect day to maybe, hey,
just lie in bed, sleep in...
or simply work out that flab
that's hanging over the bed!
Get up, Sulley!
I don't believe I ordered
a wake-up call, Mikey.
Hey, less talk, more pain,
marshmallow boy.
Feel the burn!
You call yourself a monster?
Scary feet, scary feet, scary feet.
Oh, the kid's awake!
Okay, scary feet, scary feet, scary
feet, scary feet, scary... Kid's asleep!
Twins and a bunk bed!
Ooh, I thought I had you there.
Okay, Sulley, here we go.
You ready? Follow it.
Oh, it's over here. Oh, look over there.
Don't let the kid touch you!
Don't let it touch you!
I don't know, but it's been said
I love scarin'kids in bed
Come on, fight that plaque.
Fight that plaque.
Scary monsters don't have plaque.
118. Do you have 119?
Do I see 120?
- Oh, I don't believe it!
- I'm not even breaking a sweat.
Not you. Look!
The new commercial's on!
The future is bright
at Monsters, Incorporated.
- I'm in this one! I'm in this one!
- We're part of your life.
We power your car. We warm your home.
We light your city.
- I'm Monsters, Incorporated.
- Hey, look! Betty!
Carefully matching every child
to their ideal monster...
to produce superior scream...
refined into clean,
dependable energy.
Every time you turn something on,
Monsters, Incorporated is there.
- I'm Monsters, Incorporated.
- We know the challenge.
The window of innocence is shrinking.
Human kids are harder to scare.
Of course, MI is prepared
for the future...
with the top scarers,
the best refineries...
and research
into new energy techniques.
- Okay, here I come.
- We're working for
a better tomorrow today!
We're Monsters, Incorporated!
We're MI, Monsters, Incorporated.
We scare because we care.
- I can't believe it.
- Oh, Mike.
I was on TV!
Ah, did you see me?
I'm a natural!
Hello? I know! Hey, wasn't I great?
Did the whole family see it?
It's your mom.
What can I say? The camera loves me.
I'm telling you, big daddy,
you're gonna be seeing this face
on TV a lot more often.
Yeah?
Like on Monstropolis's Most Wanted?
You've been jealous of my good looks
since the fourth grade, pal.
- Have a good day, sweetie.
- You too, hon.
- Ooh, okay, Sulley, hop on in.
- Nope. Uh-uh.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where you going? What are you doing?
- Mikey, there's a scream shortage.
- We're walking.
- Walking?
- Yup.
- No. Hey, no, no. Come on.
- Come on.
- My baby, look... She needs to be driven.
Bye, baby! I... I'll call you!
Hey, genius, y-you wanna know
why I bought the car, huh?
- Not really.
- To drive it. You know,
like on the street...
with the honk-honk and the vroom-vroom
and no walking involved.
Give it a rest, will you, butterball?
Come on. You could use the exercise.
I could use the exercise? Look at you.
You-You-You have your own climate.
How many tentacles jump the rope
- Morning, Mike! Morning, Sulley!
- One and two and three
- Hey, morning, kids!
- Hey, kids.
- How you doin'?
- Bye, Mike! Bye, Sulley!
Hey!
Aw, nuts.
- Hey, hey, hey, fellas!
- Hey, Tony!
- Tony!
- Hey, hey! Tony!
- Tony!
I hear somebody's close to breaking
the all-time scare record.
Ah, just trying to make sure
there's enough scream to go around.
- Hey, on the house!
- Hey, thanks!
Oh, great.
Hey, Ted! Good morning!
See that, Mikey?
Ted's walking to work.
Big deal. Guy takes five steps
and he's there.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
- Morning, Sulley.
- Morning, Ricky.
- Hey, it's the Sullster.
- See you on the scare floor, buddy.
- Hey, Marge. Hey, how was jury duty?
- Morning, Sulley!
- Hey!
- Hey, it's still leaning to the left.
- It is not!
- Hey, fellas. Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Mr Sullivan!
Guys, I told ya...
call me Sulley.
- I don't think so.
- We just wanted to
wish you good luck today.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come on, get lost, you two.
You're making him lose his focus.
- Oh. Sorry.
- See you later, fellas.
- Go get 'em, Mr Sullivan.
- Quiet!
- You're making him lose his focus.
- Oh, no. Sorry!
- Shut up!
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. I'll connect you.
Ms Fearmonger is on vacation.
Would you like her voice mail?
Oh, Schmoopsie-poo!
Googley Bear!
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, Googley-woogley, you remembered!
- Hey, Sulley-wulley.
- Oh, hey, Celia-weelia.
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.
So, uh, are we going
anywhere special tonight?
I-I just got us into a little place
called, um, Harryhausen's.
Harryhausen's? But it's impossible
to get a reservation there.
Not for Googley Bear. I will see you
at quittin' time and not a minute later.
- Okay, sweetheart.
- Think romantical thoughts.
You and me
Me and you
Both of us together
- You know, pal, she's the one.
That's it. She is the one.
- I'm happy for you.
Oh, and, uh, thanks for hooking me up
with those reservations.
Oh, no problem.
They're under the name "Googley Bear."
Oh, good ide...
You know, that wasn't very funny.
- What the...
- Wazowski!
What do you know? It scares
little kids and little monsters.
- I wasn't scared. I have allergies.
- Uh-huh, sure.
- Hey, Randall.
- Save it for the scare floor, will you?
- I'm in the zone today, Sullivan.
Gonna be doing some serious scaring,
putting up some big numbers.
Wow, Randall. That's great. That
should make it even more humiliating
when we break the record first.
Do you hear that?
It's the winds of change.
"You hear it? You hear
the winds of ch..." What a creep.
One of these days I am really
gonna let you teach that guy a lesson.
Chalooby baby.
Good morning, Roz,
my succulent little garden snail.
- And who would we be scaring today?
- Wazowski.
You didn't file
your paperwork last night.
Oh, that darn paperwork. Wouldn't
it be easier if it all just blew away?
Don't let it happen again.
Yes, well, I'll, uh,
I'll try to be less careless.
I'm watching you, Wazowski.
Always watching.
- Ooh, she's nuts.
- Always!
All scare floors are now active.
Assistants,
please report to your stations.
Okay, people,
Eastern Seaboard coming on-line.
We got scarers coming out!
Ooh, they're so awesome!
Hey, may the best monster win.
I plan to.
We are on in seven, six...
five, four, three, two...
You're the boss. You're the boss.
You're the big, hairy boss.
Oh, I'm feelin' good today, Mikey!
Yeah!
Oh! That-a-boy, that-a-boy.
Another door comin' right up.
You're still behind, Randall.
You know, maybe I should realign
the scream intake valve...
- Just get me another door!
- A door! Yes! Door!
Well, Jerry,
what's the damage so far?
We may actually make
our quota today, sir.
First time in a month.
- What happened?
- The kid almost touched me.
- She got this close to me.
- She wasn't scared of you?
She was only six!
I could have been dead!
I could have died!
Keep it together, man.
Hey, we got a dead door over here!
- We're coming! Look out!
- Coming! Back away!
Excuse us!
We've lost 58 doors this week, sir.
Oh, kids these days. They just
don't get scared like they used to.
Let 'er rip!
- Sir?
- What?
Look.
Attention. We have a new scare leader...
Randall Boggs.
Look at those numbers!
Slumber party.
- Never mind.
- Hey, watch it!
Well, James,
that was an impressive display.
Oh, just doing my job,
Mr Waternoose.
Of course, I did learn
from the best.
If I don't see a new door
at my station in five seconds...
I will personally
put you through the shredder!
Hey, Wazowski, nice job.
Those numbers are pretty sweet.
Are they? You know,
I hadn't even noticed.
- And, uh, how is Georgie doin'?
- He's doing great.
I love working
with that big guy.
Keep the doors comin', Charlie.
I'm on a roll today.
George and I are like brothers...
23-19! We have a 23-19!
Red alert! Red alert! Red alert!
Red alert! Red alert!
George Sanderson,
please remain motionless.
- Prepare for decontamination.
- Get it off! Get it off!
Duck and cover, people!
Oh, not the CD A!
- Move! Move! Move!
- Coming through, please. Step aside.
Clear the contaminated area.
- We have a 23-19 in progress.
- Keep the area clear.
- Coming through. Watch your step.
Stand back. Careful.
All clear. Situation is
niner-niner-zero. Ready for decon.
Hey, thanks, guys.
That was a close one.
Okay.
Okay, people, take a break.
We gotta shut down for a half hour
and reset the system.
An entire scare floor out of commission.
What else can go wrong?
Oh, what a day.
We're just going through
a rough time, sir. Everyone knows
you're gonna get us through it.
Tell that
to the board of directors.
James, this company has been
in my family for three generations.
I would do anything
to keep it from going under.
- Well, so would I, sir.
- Well...
- Say, I could use
your help with something.
- Anything, sir.
You see, we've hired some new
scare recruits, and, frankly,
they're... they're, um, uh...
- Inexperienced?
- Oh, they stink!
I thought maybe
you might come by tomorrow and,
uh, give them a demonstration...
show them what it takes
to be our top scarer, huh?
I'll start out with
the old Waternoose jump-and-growl.
Oh, yes, now, that's my boy!
Let's go, everybody. All doors
must be returned. No exceptions!
- Oh, yeah.
- I've never seen anything
like you today.
- You were on a roll, my man.
- Another day like this,
and that scare record's in the bag.
That's right, baby.
So get this. As if dinner
wasn't enough, I'm taking her to
a monster truck rally afterwards.
- Nice.
- What's on your agenda?
- I'm gonna head home
and work out some more.
- Again?
You know, there's more to life
than scaring.
Ooh.
Hey, can I borrow your odorant?
Yeah, I got, uh, Smelly Garbage
or Old Dumpster.
- You got, uh, Low Tide?
- No.
- How about Wet Dog?
Yep. Stink it up.
You know, I am so romantic sometimes
I think I should just marry myself.
- Give me a break, Mike.
- What a night of romance
I got ahead of me.
Tonight is about me and Celia.
Ooh, the love boat
is about to set sail.
'Cause I gotta tell you,
buddy, that face of hers,
it just makes my heart go...
Hello, Wazowski.
- Fun-filled evening planned for tonight?
- Well, as a matter of fact...
Then I'm sure you filed
your paperwork correctly for once.
Your stunned silence
is very reassuring.
Oh, no, my scare reports.
I left them on my desk.
And if I'm not at the restaurant
in five minutes, they're gonna give
our table away. What am I gonna tell...
- Schmoopsie-poo.
- Hey, Googley Bear. Want to get going?
- Uh, do I ever. It's just that...
- What?
- You know, it... There's a small...
- I don't understand.
- It's just that...
- I-It's just that I forgot about
some paperwork I was supposed to file.
Mike was reminding me.
Thanks, buddy.
I was? I mean, I was.
Yeah. I was.
- Oh. Okay. Let's go, then.
- We're going.
On my desk, Sulley.
The pink copies go to Accounting,
the fuchsia ones go to Purchasing...
and the goldenrod ones go to Roz.
Leave the puce.
Pink copies go to Accounting,
the fuchsia ones go to Roz.
No, the fuchsia ones go to Purchasing,
the goldenrod ones go to Roz...
Man, I have no idea what puce is.
Oh, that's puce.
Uh, hello! Anyone?
There's a door here.
Hello. Hey.
Psst. Anybody scaring in here?
Hello. Yo.
Kitty!
No, no, stay back!
Hold it, hold it.
Oh, Michael, I've had a lot of birthda...
Well, not a lot of birthdays.
But this is the best birthday ever.
What are you looking at?
Oh, I was just thinking about
the first time I laid eye on you,
how pretty you looked.
- Stop it.
- Your hair was shorter then.
- I'm thinking about getting it cut.
- No, no, I-I like it this length.
I like everything about you.
Just the other day, someone asked me
who I thought the most beautiful
monster was in all of Monstropolis.
- Do you know what I said?
- What did you say?
- I said...
- Sulley?
- Sulley?
- No! No, no.
- That's not what I
was gonna say! I mean...
- Mike, you're not making sense.
- Sure, he's handsome,
I mean, for like a big, rugged...
- Hi, guys.
What a coincidence
running into you here. Uh...
- I'm just gonna order something to go.
- Michael.
- Sulley.
- Uh, I wonder what's good here.
- Get out of here.
You're ruining everything.
- I went back to get your paperwork,
and there was a door.
- What?
- A door?
- Randall was in it.
Wait a minute. Randall? That cheater.
He's trying to boost his numbers.
- There's something else.
- What?
- What?
- Look in the bag.
What bag?
- They don't have anything I like here!
So take care, Celia!
- Excuse me, sir.
- Michael, what's going on?
- Celia, please try to understand.
- I have to do something!
- Michael!
- Oh, that's good.
- On three. One, two...
- A kid!
- Boo!
A kid!
There's a kid here!
A human kid!
Googley Bear!
Come on!
Let's get outta here!
Please remain calm.
This is not a drill.
78-35 in progress.
Please advise.
- Michael? Michael!
- Celia!
- Please come with me.
- Stop pushing.
- Hey, get your hands
off my Schmoopsie-poo!
Building clear.
Ready for decontamination.
Well, I don't think that date
could've gone any worse.
If witnesses are to be believed, there
has been a child security breach...
for the first time
in monster history.
We can neither confirm nor deny the
presence of a human child here tonight.
Well, a kid flew right over me
and blasted a car with its laser vision.
I tried to run from it,
but it picked me up with its mind
powers and shook me like a doll.
It's true!
I saw the whole thing!
It is my professional opinion...
that now is the time to panic.
Oh, it's coming! It's coming!
Boo!
Come here, kid!
No, don't touch those,
you little...
Now, those were alphabetized.
It's okay. It's all right.
As long as it doesn't come near us,
we're gonna be okay.
Oh, y-you like this? Fetch!
Hey, hey, that's it!
No one touches little Mikey.
Mike, give her the bear.
Oh, no.
Make it stop, Sulley!
Make it stop!
Here, look. Here, see the bear?
Here. Ooh, nice bear.
Sulley!
Ooh, bear! Ooh!
Ooh, he's a happy bear!
And he's not crying, and neither
should you, or we'll be in trouble
'cause they're gonna find us.
So please stop crying right now.
- Good. Good, Sulley.
Keep it up. You're doing great.
- I'm a happy bear, yeah.
- Oh, she touched me! It touched me!
- Sulley, the bear!
The bear! Give me the...
What was that?
I have no idea, but it would be
really great if it didn't do it again.
How could I do this?
How could I be so stupid?
- This could destroy the company.
- The company?
Who cares about the company?
What about us?
That thing is a killing machine!
I bet it's just waiting for us
to fall asleep, and then wham!
Oh, we're easy prey, my friend.
Easy prey. We're sitting targets.
Okay, look,
I think I have a plan here.
Using mainly spoons,
we dig a tunnel under the city...
and release it into the wild.
Spoons.
That's it. I'm out of ideas.
We're closed.
Hot air balloon? Too expensive.
Giant slingshot? Too conspicuous.
Enormous wooden horse? Too Greek.
No plan. I can't think.
Can't think. Flatlining.
- Flatlining.
- Uh, Mike, I think she's getting tired.
Well, then why don't you find
someplace for it to sleep...
while I think of a plan!
Are you sleepy? You want to sleep?
Is that what you want?
Okay. All right. I'm making
a nice little area for you to...
No. Hey, hey. That's my bed.
You're gonna get your germs all over it.
Fine. My chair's
more comfortable anyway.
What?
It's just a closet.
Will you go to sleep?
Hey, that looks like Randall.
Randall's your monster.
You think he's gonna come
through the closet and scare you.
Oh, boy. How do I explain this?
Uh, it's empty.
See?
No monster in here.
Well, now there is, but, uh,
l-I'm not gonna scare you.
I'm off duty.
Okay. How about I sit here
until you fall asleep?
Go ahead. Uh, go to sleep. Now.
Now. Go.
Uh, you go...
to sleep.
Hey, Mike, this might sound crazy,
but I don't think that kid's dangerous.
Really?
Well, in that case let's keep it.
- I always wanted a pet
that could kill me!
- Now, look.
- What if we just
put her back in her door?
- What?
Mike, think about it. If we send her
back, it's like it never happened.
- Everything goes back to normal.
- Is that a joke? Tell me you're joking.
Sulley, I'd like to think
that given the circumstances...
I've been extremely forgiving up to now,
but that is a horrible idea.
What are we gonna do, march
right out into public with that thing?
Then we just waltz right up
to the factory, right?
I can't believe we are waltzing
right up to the factory.
Sulley, a mop, a couple of lights
and some chair fabric
are not gonna fool anyone.
Just think about a few names,
will ya? Loch Ness, Bigfoot,
the Abominable Snowman.
They all got one thing
in common, pal: Banishment.
- We could be next!
- Don't panic. We can do this.
- Hey, how you doin', Frank?
- Hey, guys.
Everything's going to be okay.
- Number One wants
this place dusted for prints.
- Careful with that.
- I got a good view from here.
- A little lower.
This was recovered at the scene.
- Don't panic. Don't panic.
- Don't tell me not to panic.
- Just keep it together. Stay cool.
- Everything is not okay. It's not okay.
- Boo!
- Could be contaminated.
- Gentlemen, safety is
our number-one concern.
- Now, if there's anything that...
- Boo.
- No, not now, not now, and...
Oh, hello, little one.
Where did you come from?
- Mr Waternoose!
- Ah, James, is this one yours?
Uh, actually, that's my, uh,
cousin's sister's, uh, daughter, sir.
Yeah, it's, uh, it's, uh,
Bring An Obscure Relative To Work Day.
Must've missed the memo.
Well, listen, James, why don't you stop
by the simulator after lunch today...
and give us that scare demonstration
we talked about, huh?
- Yeah...
Oh! Oh, sir, uh, today might be...
- Excuse me, Mr Waternoose.
Yes, yes, I'm coming. All right, then.
I'll see you this afternoon, James.
That is, if these gentlemen
haven't shut us down.
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, a scare demo. Well, that is great.
Why am I the last to know?
We can bring your cousin's sister's
daughter along. She'll be a big hit.
Halt! Stop him!
Hold him down.
Come on. The coast is clear. Okay, all
we have to do is get rid of that thing.
So wait here while
I get its card key.
But she can't stay here.
This is the men's room.
That is the weirdest thing you have
ever said. It's fine. It's okay.
Look, it loves it here.
It's dancing with joy.
I'll be right back
with its door key.
That's a cute little dance you've got.
That almost looks like you gotta...
Uh, are you done in there?
Sorry. Sorry.
Okay, you finished now, right?
Hello.
Boo!
Where did she go?
Did she disappear?
Did she turn invisible?
I just have no idea.
- Gotcha!
- Boo!
Hey, you're good.
Be relaxed, be relaxed,
be relaxed.
Roz, my tender, oozing blossom,
you're looking fabulous today.
Is that a new haircut? Come on, tell me.
It's a new haircut, isn't it?
It's got to be a new haircut.
New make-up. You've had a lift, you've
had a tuck, you've had something.
Something has been inserted
in your skin that makes you look like...
Listen, I need a favour.
Randall was working late last night
out on the scare floor.
I really need the key
for the door he was using.
Well, isn't that nice?
But guess what. You didn't turn in
your paperwork last night.
- He didn't... I... No p-paperwork?
- This office is now closed.
Ready or not, here I come.
I'm getting warmer. Any second now.
Fee, fi, fo...
- What are you doing?
- I-I'm-I'm looking for the kid.
- You lost it?
- No, no. She was just, uh...
Here she is...
Hey, what's the matter?
- Look, I already told your buddies
I haven't seen anything.
- All right. Carry on.
Randall, thank goodness!
What are we gonna do about the child?
Will you... shh!
The front page! It's on the front page.
The child, the one you were after!
Will you be quiet? Don't you think
I'm aware of the situation?
I was up all night trying to find it.
I-I did a simple calculation, factoring
in the size of the sushi restaurant.
The child may have escaped!
Yeah, well, until we know
for sure, we're gonna act like
nothing happened, understand?
You just get the machine up and running.
I'll take care of the kid.
And when I find whoever let it out,
they're dead!
- Why are you still here?
Come on, go! Move! Now!
- Oh. Yes, go, go, go!
Now, now, now, now!
I'm not here!
They're gone.
This is bad.
This is so very bad.
- What were they
talking about, a machine?
- Who cares?
Look, don't panic.
All we have to do is call
her door down and send her home.
You're right. You're right.
We're just two regular Joes on our way
to work. We will blend right in.
- Top of the mornin', fellas.
- Hey, what's shakin', bacon?
Did you lose weight?
Or a limb?
- You have her card key, right?
- Of course I have her card key.
I told you I'd get her card key.
I went and got her card key,
and now I have her card key.
Okay, here we go.
Take care of yourself.
Try not to run through any more closets.
- Mike, that's not her door.
- What are you talking about?
Of course it's her door. It's her door.
- No, her door was white.
- No.
- And it had flowers on it.
No. It must have been dark last night,
because this is its door.
Hey, you hear that? Sounds like fun
in there. Okay, send me a postcard, kid.
That's Mike Wazowski, care of 22 "Mike
Wazowski, You Got Your Life Back" Lane.
Very good. Now, bon voyage.
Bye-bye! Come on!
Look at the stick. See the stick?
Go get the stick. Go fetch.
- Mike, this isn't Boo's door.
- Boo? What's Boo?
That's what I decided to call her.
Is there a problem?
Sulley, you're not supposed to name it.
Once you name it,
you start getting attached to it.
Now, put that thing back
where it came from, or so help me...
Oh, hey, we're rehearsing a-a scene for
the upcoming company play called, uh...
Put That Thing Back Where It Came From,
Or So Help Me.
It's a musical. Yeah.
Put that thing back where it came from
or so help me
So help me, so help me
And cut!
We're still working on it. It's a work
in progress, but, hey, we need ushers.
Sulley, I've had enough.
Now say goodbye to...
- Where'd it go? What'd you do with it?
- Where is she?
- I don't believe it.
She got away from you again?
- Boo!
Well, that is just... Wait a minute.
The sun is coming up.
This is perfect. She's gone!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where you going? Sulley, please.
Don't blow this, not when we're
so close to breaking the record!
Come on,
somebody else will find the kid.
It'll be their problem, not ours.
She's out of our hair!
- What are you two doing?
- They're rehearsing a play.
- She's out of our hair
- Can it, Wazowski.
So what do you think of that kid getting
out, Sullivan? Pretty crazy, huh?
Oh, yeah. Crazy.
Word on the street is the kid's
been traced back to this factory.
- You haven't seen anything, have you?
- Uh, well, uh...
No. No way.
But if it was an inside job,
uh, I-I'd put my money on Waxford.
- Waxford?
- Yeah, the one on station six.
You know, he's got them shifty eyes.
- Hey, Waxford!
- Sulley!
Michael Wazowski!
Last night was one of the worst nights
of my entire life, bar none.
- I thought you cared about me.
- Honey, please, Schmoopsie.
- I thought you liked sushi.
- Sushi? Sushi?
- You think this is about sushi?
- Schmoopsie!
- Wazowski!
- Michael! Mi... Men!
Breathe. Keep breathing.
- Where's the kid?
- Kid? What kid?
- It's here in the factory, isn't it?
- You're not pinning this on me.
It never would've gotten out
if you hadn't been cheating last night.
Cheating?
Cheating. Right.
Okay, I think I know how
to make this all go away.
What happens when the whistle blows
in five minutes?
- Uh, I get a timeout?
- Everyone goes to lunch.
Which means
the scare floor will be...
- Painted?
- Empty!
It'll be empty, you idiot!
You see that clock?
When the big hand is pointing up
and the little hand is pointing up...
the kid's door
will be in my station.
But when the big hand points down...
the door will be gone.
You have until then to put the kid back.
Get the picture?
Boo! No!
- Hey, you! Halt! He's the one.
- Uh...
- The one from the commercial.
- Affirmative. That's him.
- Can we get an autograph?
- Ohh! Oh, sure. No problem.
If you could make that out
to Stephanie, my daughter.
Yes. Let's see.
From your scary friend, best wishes.
So I said, "If you talk to me
like that again, we're through!"
- What'd she say?
- You know my mom.
She sent me to my room.
- See you guys later. Take it easy.
- Thanks a lot.
- Bottoms up.
Boo!
Hey.
Oh! Well, hello there.
What's your name?
Mike Wazowski!
Sulley! Oh! Sulley.
Okay, Sulley, come on, come on.
- Hey, you guys seen Sulley anywhere?
- Nope. Sorry.
- Oh, Sulley!
- Boy, Wazowski looks
like he's in trouble.
- 23-19! We have a 23-19!
- Halt!
- Oh, dear.
- Get him!
Sulley! Sulley!
Sulley! Oh! Great news, pal!
I got us a way out of this mess,
but we gotta hurry. Where is it?
Sull, that's a cube of garbage.
I-I can still hear her little voice.
- Mike Wazowski!
- Hey, I can hear her too.
- Mike Wazowski!
- Mike Wazowski!
- How many kids you got in there?
- Mike Wazowski!
- Mike Wazowski!
- Kitty!
- Boo!
Boo, are you all right?
I was so worried! I was...
Don't you ever run away
from me again, young lady.
Oh, but I'm so glad you're safe.
Oh, my, what an affectionate father.
Uh, actually, she's my, uh,
my cousin's sister's...
- Okay, Sulley, that's enough. Let's go.
- Mike Wazowski!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Step aside, kid. We're in a...
- Will you stop making Boo laugh!
- I didn't! Come on!
- I still don't understand.
You got Boo's door?
- I'll explain later. Run.
Okay, let's move, let's move, let's
move. Come on. Oh, please be there,
please be there, please be there.
- There it is, just like Randall said.
- Randall? Wait a minute. Whoa. Hey.
1-2-3-4, get the kid
back through the door.
- Hey. Hey.
- We're gonna get our lives back.
The nightmare is over!
- Hey, it's okay, Boo.
- Hey, what's the matter?
Come on, it's time to move!
Mike, what are you thinking?
We can't trust Randall. He's after Boo.
- Who cares? Let's go.
This is a limited-time offer.
- No, no. I don't like this.
Look, Sulley, you wanted her door,
and there it is. Now let's move.
- No, Mike.
- You want me to prove
everything's on the up-and-up? Fine.
- He wants the door, I get the door.
He don't want the door.
- Mike, wait.
He's a paranoid, delusional fur ball.
Mike!
Hey, Sulley,
where you been all day?
Sulley? Sulley?
Huh? Mike.
Mike.
Where are you?
Are you in there?
Where are you, buddy?
Mike, where are you?
Boo, way to go!
It's okay.
Oh, Randall, did you take care
of that situation?
Yeah, of course I did. Let's get going.
We gotta make up for lost time.
- You got the extra scream cans?
- Uh, right.
- So to confirm, then, you did find the...
- Yes, I got the kid!
Oh, huzzah! That's great news!
- Not that I was concerned,
of course. I knew that...
- Just get over here and help me.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
While we're young here, Fungus.
Kid needs to
take off a few pounds.
Wazowski! Where is it,
you little one-eyed cretin?
Okay, first of all, it's cretin.
If you're gonna threaten me,
do it properly.
Second of all, you're nuts
if you think kidnapping me is gonna
help you cheat your way to the top.
You still think this is about
that stupid scare record?
Well, I did, right up until
you chuckled like that.
And, uh, now I'm thinkin'
I should just get out of here.
I am about to revolutionize
the scaring industry, and when I do...
even the great James P. Sullivan
is gonna be working for me.
Well, somebody's
certainly been a busy bee.
First I need to know where the kid is,
and you're gonna tell me.
- Yeah, I don't know anything.
- Uh-huh. Sure.
I-I don't. I mean, I don't.
Uh-oh. What's that? Wait.
Come on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Uh-oh. Uh-oh! Oh, come on.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey!
This thing is moving.
I don't like big moving things
that are moving towards me.
No, come on. Hey! Randall!
Say hello
to the Scream Extractor.
Hello.
Come on. Where you going? We-We'll talk.
Come on, we'll have a latte.
Come on! We can talk about this.
What's that thing? What is that thing?
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no!
Oh! No, come on, guys!
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Oh, for...
What did you do wrong this time?
- I-I don't know.
I calibrated the drive...
- Go check the machine!
Th-There must be something wrong
with the scream intake valve.
Yeah, th-that's the problem
with these 32-50 units, boss.
See, the old intake valve
is always the first thing to go.
I-I told them this.
Psst. Fungus. Fungus.
You like cars, huh?
'Cause I got a really nice car.
You let me go,
I'll give you a ride in the car.
- Please, Fungus?
- I'm sorry, Wazowski.
But Randall said
I'm not allowed to fraternize
with victims of his evil plot.
What happened?
Where's Wazowski?
Where is he?
- Come on.
- This is crazy. He's gonna kill us.
- Careful with that.
Could be contaminated.
- We gotta get out of here now!
We can start a whole new life
somewhere far away.
Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.
Goodbye, Mr Waternoose.
- No, Mike. Wait.
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Follow me. I have an idea.
- No. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.
- No, no, no, no, no.
What was that? You're trying to
scare the kid, not lull it to sleep.
I was going for a snake-slash-ninja
approach with a little hissing.
Oh, how many times
do I have to tell you?
It's all about presence,
about how you enter the room.
- Mr Waternoose!
- James. Perfect timing.
- No, no, no, sir, you don't understand.
- Ah, now, show these monsters
how it's done.
- What? No, no. I ca... I ca... Sir. Sir!
- You have to listen to me.
- Pay attention, everyone.
- You're about to see
the best in the business.
- Sir, I c...
- Reset the simulator.
- But, but, sir...
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Mom.
- Sleep tight, kiddo.
- Kitty!
- No, Boo. No, no!
- Now, give us a big, loud roar.
- Mr Waternoose,
there's no time for this.
- Come on, come on.
What are you waiting for? Roar!
- B-B-But, sir...
- Roar!
- Ohh.
- Well done. Well done, James.
- Boo?
- All right, gentlemen.
- Right this way, everyone.
- I hope you've learned
a valuable lesson in scaring today.
Boo?
Boo?
Boo, it's me.
- The child!
- Sir, she isn't toxic.
- What?
- I know it sounds crazy, but trust me.
- Sulley...
- Boo? No, no, no, no, it's okay.
I was just...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, don't be scared.
That wasn't real. It's just a...
I was just...
- Boo.
- And he was gonna test it out
on that sweet little girl.
- Boo?
- Now that we have her,
he is trying to kill us.
- This whole thing is Randall's fault.
- Randall?
Yes, and we can take you
to his secret lab which is
right here in this factory.
How could this happen?
How could this happen?
- Does anyone else know about this?
- No, sir.
Good. This company can't afford
any more bad publicity.
Now, before we do anything else...
let's take care of the child.
Oh, I never thought things would
come to this. Not in my factory.
I'm sorry you boys got mixed up
in this, especially you, James.
But now we can set everything straight
again for the good of the company.
- Uh, sir, that's not her door.
- I know, I know.
It's yours.
No!
Boo!
No. No.
No, no, no, no, no!
It's too late! We're banished, genius.
We're in the human world!
Oh, what a great idea,
going to your old pal Waternoose.
Too bad he was in
on the whole thing!
All you had to do was listen to me,
just once!
But you didn't, did you?
You're still not listening!
Take that!
Welcome to the Himalayas!
Abominable! Can you believe that?
Do I look abominable to you?
Why can't they call me the Adorable
Snowman or, or the Agreeable Snowman,
for crying out loud?
I'm a nice guy. Snow cone?
No, no, no, don't worry.
It's lemon.
Uh, how 'bout you, big fella?
Snow cone?
Did you see the way
she looked at me?
Ah, poor guy. I understand.
It ain't easy being banished.
Uh, take my buddy Bigfoot.
When he was banished, he fashioned
an enormous diaper out of poison ivy.
Wore it on his head like a tiara.
Called himself King Itchy.
It won't be so hard for you guys though,
you know. I mean, how lucky can you get?
- Banished with your best friend.
- He is not my friend.
Oh. I-I just assumed you were buddies,
you know, when I saw you out there
in the snow hugging and all, I...
Look at that big jerk. Ruined my life,
and for what? A stupid kid!
Because of you, I am now stuck
in this frozen wasteland!
Wasteland?
I think you mean wonderland.
I mean, how about
all this fabulous snow, huh?
Oh, and wait till you see the local
village. Cutest thing in the world.
I haven't even mentioned
all the free yak's milk.
- Wait. What did you say?
- Uh, yak's milk.
Milking a yak
ain't exactly a picnic...
but, you know, once you pick
the hairs out, it's very nutritious.
No, no, something about a village.
Where? Are there kids in it?
Kids? Sure. Tough kids, sissy kids,
kids who climb on rocks.
- Where is it?
- Ah, hey, hey!
It's at the bottom of the mountain.
- Around a three-day hike.
- Oh! Three days?
We need to get there now!
You want to go to the village?
Okay, rule number one out here.
Always... No.
Never go out in a blizzard.
We need to get to Boo.
Boo? What about us?
Ever since that kid came in,
you've ignored everything I've said.
And now look where we are!
Oh, we were about to break
the record, Sulley.
- We would have had it made.
- None of that matters now.
None of it matters?
W-W-Wait a second.
None of it matters?
Okay, that's, uh... No. Good. Great.
So now the truth comes out,
doesn't it?
Oh, would you look at that?
We're out of snow cones.
Uh, let me just go outside
and make some more.
Sulley, what about everything
we ever worked for?
Does that matter, huh?
What about Celia?
I am never... never gonna see her again.
Doesn't that matter?
And what about me?
I'm your pal.
I'm-I'm-I'm your best friend.
Don't I matter?
I'm sorry, Mike.
I'm sorry we're stuck out here.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
But Boo's in trouble.
I think there might be a way to save her
if we can just get down to that...
We? Whoa, whoa, whoa. We?
No, there's no "we" this time, pal.
I-If-If-If you want to go out there
and freeze to death...
you be my guest...
because you're on your own.
Hey, I got more snow cones!
Oh, come on now, George.
I know you can do this.
I picked out an easy door for you
in Nepal.
Nice, quiet Nepal.
You know, you're right.
Here, take this.
- Go get 'em, Georgie!
- Gangway! Look out! Comin' through!
- Sorry, George.
- What the...
- Hey, you can't just...
Twenty-three-nine...
- Out of the way!
- Hey!
Help!
Finally. I never should have
trusted you with this.
Because of you,
I had to banish my top scarer.
Ah, with this machine,
we won't need scarers.
Besides, Sullivan got
what he deserved.
Sullivan was twice the scarer
you will ever be.
Kitty!
- Kitty!
- Sullivan?
- Kitty!
- Sorry, Boo.
Stop him!
Let's get you home.
Finish him off!
You don't know how long
I've wanted to do that, Sullivan!
- Mike?
- Look, it's not that I don't
care about the kid.
- Mike, you don't understand.
- Yes, I do. I was just mad, that's all.
I needed some time to think. But
you shouldn't have left me out there.
- I'm being attacked.
- No, I'm not attacking you.
I-I-I'm trying to be honest.
Just hear me out.
Look, you and I are a team.
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.
I-I-I know, kid.
He-He's too sensitive.
Come on, pal,
if you start crying I'm gonna cry
and I'll never get through this.
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you,
but I am now.
Hey, Sulley, I am baring my soul here.
The least you could do is pay attention.
Hey, look at that.
It's Randall. It's...
- Oh.
- Come on!
- Get up! There can't be any witnesses.
- There won't be.
- I'm glad you came back, Mike.
- Somebody's gotta take care you,
you big hair ball.
- Schmoopsie-poo, I really can't talk.
- Come on!
Michael, if you don't tell me what's
going on right now, we are through!
- Do you hear me? Through!
- Okay, here's the truth.
You know the kid that they're
looking for? Sulley let her in.
We tried to send her back,
but Waternoose had this secret plot...
and now Randall's right behind us,
and he's trying to kill us.
You expect me to believe
that pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?
Mike Wazowski!
- I love you, Schmoopsie-poo!
- Will you move it? Hey! Look out.
Idiot!
- Look out.
Coming through here. Coming through.
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Make way. Move it!
Hurry up. Hurry up.
- There they are!
- Attention, employees.
Randall Boggs has just broken
the all-time scare record.
Huh? No, I didn't.
Get out of my way! Let me go!
Go get 'em, Googley Bear.
- There it is!
- Get off my tail. Let me go!
- Sulley, what are you doing?
- Grab on, Mike.
- Are you out of your mind?
- Sulley, what are we doing?
- We have to get Boo's door
and find a station.
What a plan.
Simple, yet insane!
- Whoa.
- Oh, boy.
- Hold on!
- Wow!
- Don't look down!
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, no!
No!
- Boo's door!
- There it is!
How are we supposed
to get to it now?
Oh, it's a dead end, Sulley.
There he is.
- Make her laugh!
- What? Sulley!
- Just do it!
Ow!
- Get it open!
- Here he comes.
Give me that kid!
- Why couldn't we get banished here?
- Come on. We gotta find another door.
Look! Boo's door!
- There he is. Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Give me your hand.
- Come on. It slides, it slides.
- Ooh, right, right, right.
Jump! I'm right behind you.
Come on!
- Hurry up! Keep moving!
- Get inside!
That was weird.
Mike? Ooh, sorry, buddy.
I hope that hurt, lizard boy.
Great job, buddy.
We lost him.
Boo!
Nice workin' with ya!
- Get it open!
- I'm trying!
- Open the door!
- Come on! Get in here!
Boo!
There they are!
Sulley, what are you doing?
Sulley!
- Looks like we caught the express, pal!
- Do you see 'em?
Straight ahead!
- Kitty!
- Boo!
Look at everybody's
favourite scarer now!
You stupid, pathetic waste!
You've been number one for too long,
Sullivan. Now your time is up!
And don't worry,
I'll take good care of the kid.
No!
She's not scared of you any more.
Looks like you're out of a job.
All right. Come on. Over the plate.
Let's see the old stuff here, pal. Come
on, now. Chuck 'im. Chuck 'im, baby.
- Hey, please, don't! Don't!
- Hum, baby, hum, baby. Here's the pitch.
And he is out of here!
Mama, another gator
got in the house.
Another gator?
Give me that shovel! Come here!
Get it, Ma!
Get that gator!
- Care to do the honours, Mikey?
- With pleasure.
That's right, Boo.
You did it! You beat him.
Come on.
Okay, Boo, it's time to go home.
Take care of yourself
and be a good girl, okay?
- Oh, no!
- The power's out. Make her laugh again.
All right. I got a move here.
It'll bring down the house.
- Oh, sorry. She didn't see that.
- What? What'd you do, forget to check
if her stupid hood was up? You big dope!
Uncle Mike,
try not to yell in front of her.
- You know we still need her to laugh.
- Right.
Hey, Boo! Just kidding. Look!
Funny, right, huh? See, with the...
These are the jokes, kid.
- What's happening?
- Hold on!
When the door lands in the station,
cut the power.
You'll have the child and the criminals
responsible for this whole mess.
Great. A welcoming committee.
What are we gonna do?
This is the CD A. Come out slowly
with the child in plain sight.
Okay. Okay. You got us.
Here we are. Here's the kid.
I'm cooperating. But before you
take us away, I have one thing to say.
- Catch!
- 23-19!
- 23-19!
- We have a toxic projectile.
Isolate the contaminate.
- Halt!
- After the suspect!
- Clear the area!
- Stop him!
- Come on.
- Don't let them get away.
What? Wait, wait! Come back!
He has the child!
Sullivan? Sullivan!
Give me the child!
Give her to me!
Open this door! Open this door!
Sullivan! Don't do it.
- Come on.
- Don't go in that room!
I think we stopped him, Boo.
You're safe now.
You be a good girl, okay?
This has gone far enough, James.
- She's home now.
Just leave her alone.
- I can't do that!
She's seen too much.
You both have.
- It doesn't have to be this way.
- I have no choice!
- Times have changed.
Scaring isn't enough any more.
- But kidnapping children?
I'll kidnap a thousand children
before I let this company die!
And I'll silence anyone
who gets in my way!
- No!
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, sweetheart.
- What? What? Wh-Wh-What is this?
- Good night, Mom. Good night, Mom.
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you guys...
but I spotted several
big mistakes.
- But... But...
But h-how did... h-how did...
- You know what?
Let's watch my favourite part
again, shall we?
I'll kidnap a thousand children
before I let this company die!
- What? What?
- I'll kidnap a thousand children
before I let this company die!
I'll kidnap a thousand children
before I let this company die!
- I'll get him.
All right, come with us.
- Wh-What are you doing?
Take your hands off me. You can't arrest
me. I hope you're happy, Sullivan.
You've destroyed this company.
Monsters, Incorporated is dead!
Where will everyone
get their scream now?
The energy crisis will only
get worse because of you!
Stay where you are.
Number One wants to talk to you.
Attention!
- Hello, boys.
- Roz?
Two and a half years of undercover work
were almost wasted...
when you intercepted
that child, Mr Sullivan.
Of course, without your help,
I never would have known...
that this went
all the way up to Waternoose.
Now, about the girl.
I just want to send her home.
Very good.
Bring me a door shredder.
What? You mean...
You mean I can't see her again?
That's the way it has to be.
I'll give you five minutes.
- Well, so long, kid.
- Mike Wazowski!
Yeah. Aw, Boo.
It's been fun.
Go ahead. Go grow up.
Uh, B-Boo... Um, Boo?
Oh, look at that.
Yeah, you know...
Oh, that's cute, yeah.
Uh, Boo, um...
- Well, that's very nice.
- Kitty.
Come here, you.
Oh, he's a happy bear
Nothing's coming out of your closet
to scare you any more, right?
Yeah.
Goodbye, Boo.
Kitty.
Kitty has to go.
Boo!
Kitty?
None of this ever happened,
gentlemen.
And I don't want to see
any paperwork on this.
Take him away.
I bet we get the rest of the day off.
You idiot! They're gonna
shut down the factory!
I'm tellin' you, pal, when that wall
went up, you should have seen the look
on Waternoose's face.
I hope we get a copy of that tape.
Hey, you all right?
Come on, pal. Cheer up.
We did it. We got Boo home.
Oh, sure, we put the factory
in the toilet and, gee, hundreds
of people will be out of work now.
Not to mention the angry mob
that'll come after us
when there's no more power.
But hey, at least we had
some laughs, right?
Laughs.
Hey, is this thing on?
Hello! Hello! Testing! Testing!
Hey, good evening. How are you?
How are you? Nice to see you.
I tell ya, it's great to be here
in your room. Where you from?
Never mind. You're in kindergarten,
right? Oh, I love kindergarten.
Best three years of my life.
Of my life.
But I love sports.
Dodge ball was the best. Oh, yeah.
I was the fastest one out there.
Of course, I was the ball. But I...
I was the ball, see?
All right.
Hey, thanks a lot.
I'll be here all week.
Remember to tip your waitresses.
Great job, Mikey. You filled your quota
on the first kid of the day.
Not bad, huh? You know, only somebody
with perfect comedic timing...
could produce this much energy
in one shot.
Uh-huh. And the fact that laughter
is ten times more powerful than scream
had nothing to do with it.
Oh, Googley Bear.
Come here, you.
- Schmoopsie-poo!
- Googley.
Girls. Girls. Quit.
Stop, stop, stop.
Michael, you're such a charmer.
- Hey, did you bring the magazine?
- They just delivered a whole box.
Let me see it!
Sulley and I made the cover, right?
- I don't believe it.
- Googley Bear.
I'm on the cover of a magazine!
Oh, this is great!
- Hey, Sulley!
- Hey, uh, Mike. I was, uh, just...
- Listen, if you got a minute, there's
something I wanna show you. Okay?
- B-B-But...
- Close your eyes. Follow me.
- I-I-I...
- Come on. No peeking.
- Keep coming, keep coming, keep coming.
Come on. Keep coming, keep coming.
- Mike!
And follow the sultry sound
of my voice.
Okay, stop. Open 'em.
- Ta-da!
- Mike!
- Is that...
- Sorry it took so long, pal.
It was a lot of wood
to go through.
You know, it only works
if you have every piece.
Boo?
Kitty!
Speed. Marker.
And action.
If I were a rich man
With a million or two
I'd live in a penthouse
In a room with a view
- And if I were handsome
- No way!
- It could happen.
'Cause dreams do come true.
Roll slate.
I wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have you
Wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have
Wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have
Wouldn't have nothin'
Okay, cut.
Okay, you're finished now, right?
- Hello.
- Hello.
Come on, get lost, you two.
You're making him lose his focus.
- Oh, sorry.
- See you later, fellas.
- Go get 'em, Mr Solomon.
- You idiot! It's Sullivan, not Solomon.
- What?
- You're messing up the scene.
- Sorry.
- We're never gonna work
in Hollywood again.
- Let me do it over.
- Shut up!
- Keep rolling!
- You're making it worse!
Duck and cover, people!
Hey, thanks, guys.
That was a close one.
Ta-da!
Aw, Boo, it's been fun.
Go ahead. Go throw up.
- What? Wh-Wh...
What did I say? What? What?
- Cut.
Hey, Ted, good morning!
- Cut.
- Hey, how was that? Was I scary?
- Do I get the part?
- Thank you.
- Can I do it again?
- I can be taller.
- Next.
And action.
Okay, let's move, let's move,
let's move. Come on!
Can we get a little more wax
on the floor, please?
Wait a minute.
Randall? That cheater.
- He's trying to boost his numbers.
- There's something else.
- What?
- Look-lay in the bag-bay.
- I think you mean
ook-lay in the ag-bay.
- What? Didn't I, uh...
Well, you know,
maybe you should just take a minute
and ead-ray your ipt-scray.
You think he's gonna come
through the closet and scare you.
Oh, boy. How do I explain this?
Uh, it's empty. See?
Guess who!
Hey, what's the...
Okay, very funny.
Hey, I look good in a suit.
Marker.
Let her rip! Go!
Shut it off! Shut it off!
Shut it off!
You're making it worse!
But I must admit it
Big guy, you always come through
I wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have you
You and me together
That's how it always should be
One without the other
Don't mean nothin'to me
Nothin'to me
Oh, hey!
We're rehearsing a, a scene...
for the upcoming company play
called...
Put That Thing Back Where It Came From,
Or So Help Me.
It's a musical. Yeah.
Put that thing back where it came from
Or so help me
Get that thing away from me
you guys
Put that thing back where it came from
or I'll poke myself in the eye
It's, uh, i-it's a work in progress.
I-It's gonna get better.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this year's company play...
starring, written
and directed by Mike...
- And produced.
- And produced by Mike Wazowski.
Put that thing back where it came from
or so help me
So help me
So help me get by
Put that thing back where it came from
or so help me
So help me
I just gotta cry
Your seat is right over there, sir.
- Boo!
- There's a child, there's a child
There's a human child
- Oh, no!
- Running around the restaurant
This is really wrong
What in heaven's name
will become of us
We who are living
in Monstropolis
All right, Wazowski,
tell us where the kid is.
Boo!
I will never talk. Never!
She's out of our hair
And just when I dare to care
She says, au contraire
You're my pair of friends
I love you
Keep it together, man.
And so we put that kid back
Where she came from
And she helped us to find
A better tomorrow
Today
Thank you! What a night
for my mother to be in the audience,
ladies and gentlemen. My mom!
Thank you, Monstropolis!
- I don't have to say it
- Aw, say it anyway.
'Cause we both know it's true
I wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have you
Wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have
You
One more time!
It worked!
- Don't have to say it
- I'm gonna anyway!
- 'Cause we both know it's true
- Let's take it home, big guy!
I wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have
- You
- You! You!
- A-E-l-O
- That means you. Yeah!
