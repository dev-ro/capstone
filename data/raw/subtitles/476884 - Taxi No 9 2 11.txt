"Millions come to make
their lives here."
"Set their hearts here
and get trapped forever."
"A golden nest with
no place to rest."
Even the footpath has
no place here.
"Ember or the last resort,
this is Mumbai!"
This is Mumbai.
Time is money here.
I have to cover 30 minutes
in 3 minutes flat.
Die if you so wish.
Why put others in trouble?
Ram it in yours?
Bombay... the city of dreams,
You meet all kinds of
specimens here...
And each specimen has his
own unique way of screwing you.
Now take a look at these two.
The first specimen Raghav Shastri.
He should have been
an electrician...
He blows a fuse for
the slightest reason.
"Let me into your heart..."
"Just chill chill, just chill..."
Can you see me, from the outside?
But I've been subjected
to your ugly face...
for the past 5 minutes.
Get out... - Raghav a.k.a. Raghu
A real specimen...
As in, his blood group
isn't A B or O... it's K...
Blood Group Krazy...
Krazy negative
I buy a ticket from you everyday,
but I never win.
Others do. What can I do
if you have bad luck.
Why you bashing my luck.
Don't you want to sell tickets?
Why are you hitting me?
- Why are you jinxing my luck?
If my luck wants to screw me,
what's it to you?
What's all this?
What's wrong with you?
This complete specimen
has lost 23 jobs in the past 15 years.
These days he's driving taxi.
Just stop here Raghu...
Hey, what happened?
Why didn't you stop?
He's a broke bastard...
If he can't even pay for parking...
What will he pay you?
Hey Raghu, stop, stop...
Now what happened?
All four of them are
broke bastards?
They're sly bastards.
One of them will pay...
And four will play.
Raghu... why do you not like anyone?
What's there to like?
What I do? What you do?
What they do... these guys
who hop in with you?
We all set out in the
morning, hoping...
that something good will happen...
But night falls and
it's nothing but...
This specimen has a secret life.
This Krazy's wife believes
he sells insurance policies.
Raghu's wife doesn't know
he drives a taxi.
Raghu's wife is a nurse... Sunita
She wants to work so that
they stop bickering about money
But this basket case Raghu?
He says No.
Their son is following in
M. F. Husain's steps.
He paints pictures that his dad
can put up in his cabin...
Little does he know that those
pictures are put up in a cab.
If you want to kill yourself,
go ahead...
why you messing with others?
He drives all day and
walks at night.
Hiding his cab from his wife he shall
now walk 2 kms to his house.
You've been drinking?
A little.
That's why you're so late.
I was working overtime.
People work overtime to
make more money.
I don't understand your
kind of overtime.
You're going from bad to worse,
like the grocer's bills.
You're more worried about his
bill's than about my feelings
You're not having an affair
with him are you?
If I was, we wouldn't
be short of food...
Ok, no more.
We'll figure it out tomorrow.
How many things will we
figure out tomorrow?
Rishabh's school fees,
the grocer's bill, electricity bill...
For how long can we put our
problems off until tomorrow?
That imaginary tomorrow
will never come
when everything will
suddenly be fine.
Money money money.
Whether she's on the streets
or at home, all a woman
wants is money.
Why? Have you just been
with a hooker?
Would have been better if I had.
You can't even run
your own house...
You'll get the hooker's
electricity cut off too.
Go to sleep. I'll live the way
I want to... in my next life.
Raghu was our first specimen.
Now meet our second specimen.
Jai Mittal.
He has no idea he's going
to be screwed today
This specimen's dad was
also a complete specimen
First he gave him everything. Then took
it all away. Put the brakes on his life.
You must wonder why he
did that. Let's find out...
"Love does happen
at the first sight."
"A couple of words can
make hearts fall in love."
"The world starts getting
filled with colours."
"Everything starts appearing
more beautiful."
"This happens only in love."
"Every face appears more radiant."
"Breaths turn fragrant."
"When eyes meet,
the heart beats for the beloved."
"The gaze turns mesmerizing."
"Suspended in air,
we walk on the clouds."
"Joys transcend the
limits of the skies."
"Love affects such."
See you...
Come with me... please
I can't, I've got to go.
It's late. I'll see you tomorrow?
Jai please... I'll miss you.
See you tomorrow. Drive safe ok?
Bye.
If you want to kill yourself,
go ahead...
why you messing with others?
So Jai is the sort of character
Who's never taken life seriously
So his dad had to get serious
And he had to do something
He did something
That no dad would really do...
Ladies and Gentlemen...
you all know why we are here...
My client, the Chairman
of Mittal Industries...
Mr. Shyam Mittal is
no longer with us.
As per his wishes
His will be read before all of you...
I, Shyam Mittal, of sound body
and mind, hand over...
All my properties, shares,
estates, and all other assets...
To my oldest friend, Mr. Arjun Bajaj.
To my oldest friend, Mr. Arjun Bajaj.
Yes babes, I'm awake.
How did you know it was me?
Who else would bother me
this early in the morning?
I'm bothering you?
You're the only one
who has the right to...
First think about those rights,
you're fighting for in court.
Today is an important day
for you Jai...
We'll figure out my rights after
the court's ruled on yours
Now look at the time.
Hurry up, you're late.
And don't forget to get
the file from the vault. Ok?
Don't worry Rupali...
today it'll all be ok. The court
Will rule in our favour.
I hope so.
That was Jai? - Yes...
Today's an important day for him...
For his future...
and yours too...
Stick by him today...
Hey Rishabh...
What are you doing?
Fielding.
- Whose bat is it?
Mine.
So why you fielding? Bat.
You've got to become
Tendulkar, not Kaif.
Understood?
Come on... bat.
Mohit, It's Jai.
Yeah Jai... Tell me. - Mohit I need a ring...
and this time I want the best.
Really? Is it someone special?
She's so special that
if all goes well...
I won't be buying so many
rings I'm going to marry her.
What? Marriage?
Congratulations.
I didn't think that you would
ever feel the need to marry...
Listen... could you arrange
to pay some of your dues?
Don't worry.
I'll clear them all today.
Just keep the ring ready,
I'll collect it this evening.
Watchman, if my friend comes
earlier give him the keys. - Yes sir.
Will you go Andheri?
No. - Why?
Do you lie to your wife?
What do you mean?
- Do you lie or not?
No.
I do. She might spot
me there. I won't go.
Damn... now this guy.
Yes, Mr. Tiwari.
For three months you've
been saying tomorrow...
Today you will say it again-tomorrow.
So before you say it I will
- Tomorrow. If by then,
You do not pay me the three
months rent you owe me
For the taxi, you're history
Mr. Tiwari... you know how
difficult things are for me...
Listen, I'm the one who felt
sorry for you and said,
"Drive a cab." You were
jobless for 6 months...
I thought I'd help you out,
and I'd make some money too.
But you're the only
one who's benefited.
You pay other's debts
at my expense.
I'll figure something out soon.
Not soon... Tomorrow.
If you don't pay me by tomorrow...
I'll show up at your house and
tell your wife that you drive a cab.
No, Sir, no, Please don't do that.
You know how it is...
I'll find a way by tomorrow.
But I'm driving now...
Ok, Go ahead and work.
I'll call again.
May god be with you
All the best.
He's such a nuisance...
Nothing but threats.
Go to OHM vaults near
Bandra National college. - Get in.
The distance between these
two specimens...
Isn'tjust the 4 inch
seat between them.
There's a much greater
distance between them.
Raghu says that this
is his Mumbai...
If he had his way, he'd take
people like Jai Mittal...
[ln his cab,] and drop
them off outside Mumbai
Jai says that this is
his Mumbai...
He wishes that people like Raghu...
were prevented from entering the city.
We can't say which specimen has
a greater right to the city.
But this story... its about
both these specimens.
Hey Sunny... how you doing?
Listen... Come by around 8 pm...
Yeah... let's start early.
In case I'm late, I've left
a key with security... Ok?
Hey boss... Drive fast.
You know... the speedometer
shows upto 120 km/hour...
Because it goes up to 120 km/hr.
See how fast your meter
goes... go as fast.
He's screwed me...
What did you say?
- Nothing.
Speak louder. I can't hear
you over the traffic.
All I said is drive faster.
Hello? - Hello, Jai...
Where have you reached.
Juhu! - Juhu? You're still in Juhu?
Come on, drive faster...
Actually I'm not driving Rupali...
I had a small accident last night...
Accident? You're ok aren't you?
I'm absolutely ok.
I'm coming in a cab...
Oh god Jai... Anyway,
tell him to drive fast.
Fast? He belongs in
the 20th century.
Bullock-carts are going faster...
Milkmen on bicycles will
pass us by soon...
Jai, if you don't get
there on time today...
Life will pass you by.
You will lose everything
to Arjun Bajaj.
Give him some money and tell him
to drive faster. Come on Jai.
Ok, Ok Rupali, Ok.
Now what happened.
- It's red. - So?
There's a friendly cop
across the street.
If I don't get to court on time,
I'll be hanging around...
Begging at this traffic light.
This is Bombay... where time
is money. Understood?
I need to traverse a 30 minute
distance in 3 minutes.
Here, take this... And this...
Keep the money, and follow
my instructions. That's it.
Now what are you thinking?
Your Maharashtrian hero,
Shivaji rode like the wind
with just one horse...
You have 18 horse powers.
Put it in gear and say
Long live Maharashtra.
Long live Maharashtra.
Here... Bet this on your horse.
And make it run.
People like you never
step on it, in life.
The traffic jams... they're
because of you people.
Sir, why you making fun of me.
Here you are brother...
500 rupees. Drive fast.
You won't get into any trouble.
Oh man. There's a car coming
at me. I have to brake.
I don't know whether I'm
sitting in a bloody cab
or in a bullock cart.
He's just not moving ya.
Do me a favour.
Stop the car.
Since you can't move the car,
just stop, and I'll push it.
I'm driving. I'm going fast.
You want me to have an accident?
Here, take this... 1000 rupees.
Now hurry. Step on the gas.
Come on... come on... faster...
Bloody hell, I'm getting late.
If the cops stop you, I've got money.
I'll take care of it.
Please go fast.
Press the accelerator. Go fast.
Go fast.
Look, pal... I'm late already
Ok ok... I'm driving fast.
- So go faster.
This is an old fiat not a Pajero.
Cut them off... just like that.
There's a traffic light... run it.
Here's some more money.
Run the light. Come on...
! % $ *&! What have you done!
Is your dad going to
pay for damages?
My passenger will.
What passenger?
Where is he?
I don't know where they come from...
piled into cheap trains. - Hey.
Why do all of you
come to Mumbai?
You dog. Are you drunk first
thing in the morning?
You ran the light and
look what you've done.
Are you deaf now?
You dog... l'm talking to you.
Give me your license.
Hey.
Why you hitting me...
Don't touch me... I'm warning you.
You grabbing my collar?
I'm telling you don't touch me.
When I tolerate it all silently...
you say I'm deaf!
Look at this...
it's an official badge.
So?
You'll get one whack with it
and you'll know
where we come from.
Understood? We have to come
to Bombay to straighten
out the likes of you.
You want to talk big?
You want to grab my collar:?
Why you getting physical?
Can't you talk?
He took off.
Why didn't you stop him? Police...
What police?
What are the police - What?
I'm warning you,
don't you dare use your hand.
Call the cops... - He told me to drive fast.
That's why I banged the car.
Hey... Police... police...
- What police...
Don't you know how to drive?
He told me to.
Why you screaming for the cops?
Locker Number 1129...
Your key please... Please insert
your key in the 2nd lock.
Yes... tell me Mr. Tiwari...
I've calculated... you owe me 30,600.
If you don't pay me
By tomorrow, I want my taxi back.
And... listen...
I want it as it was.
Don't try to sell or replace any parts...
Yes Mr Tiwari...
If you see the taxi...
You will not be able
to say anything.
I just want my money
tomorrow morning.
It'll be done by tomorrow.
Don't worry.
Yes... you'll get it.
Sir... This is our bible.
This is our rules and regulations book.
All the rules are laid down here.
Let me see...
Yes, Chapter 9...
incase of lost key...
Please hurry...
- Ah... one minute, one minute.
Sir, your problem's solved.
It's very simple... You see...
You'll have to make out a
simple affidavit... - Yes...
After which, our headquarters
will send someone to verify it
Then we will be clear as to
whether the key is really lost.
After that we'll make you
a new key. Oh yes...
The cost of a new key...
that's in Section 2...
How long will it take.
I'll get it done quickly for you...
Usually it takes more than 15 days...
I'll do it in 10.
Maybe you don't know who I am.
I'm Jai Mittal. Jai Mittal.
Whether you're Jai, or Veeru,
or Gabbar... it will take time.
Can't help it.
You're preventing me from
opening my own locker?
Sir, I'm not preventing you...
We'll go exactly as per our
rules and regulations...
Unfortunately...
- Ok, I've understood...
You're one of those who
likes to act important.
You want people to come
and grovel before you...
So that you feel you
are their equal...
But this is where you belong...
and this is where you will stay
all your life. Bloody loser.
What a mess... there's serious
damage. Who is it?
It's this guy...
- Hey... come on... come with me.
What's your number?
88666... come on.
Where? - What do you mean 'W here?
To a party.
To the police station... come on...
- Take him along...
Why should he take me?
You go...
Sir... I'm taking care of it.
Come on... stop making a fuss.
- He's bribed you...
Come on, what are you rambling
on for... hurry up...
It's not my fault Rupali.
I told him to run the light...
not to run into a car.
Anyway, I've misplaced the key.
What? How could you do that?
I think it fell off somewhere...
I'm going back to the accident spot.
Oh god Jai, I hope you find it.
Ok, locate it, and get to the safe.
I'll come pick you up ok?
Ok. Hopefully I'll find it.
- It'll all work out Jai... Bye. - Yup. Bye.
Sir...
- What is it?
He ran through red light.
Really?
- Then he ran into a car.
Really? - Then he ran roughshod
over the car owner...
What's your problem?
Running roughshod is ourjob
And the city administrators job...
why are you interfering?
Sir, it's not my...
it's not only my fault.
Why? Weren't you driving?
No... I mean I was driving but
- So...?
So... Sir, if I had money...
your constable would
have let me go...
He took a bribe from those
guys and let them off...
And now I'm here.
You saying the police are corrupt?
Look sir, I don't lie.
I tell it like it is.
Hey... you talking back
to the police?
First you break the rules, then
Look sir, I accept that
I was at fault...
but I'm not the only one at fault.
The person responsible for the
accident was in a hurry,
So he ran off. The other
person in the accident...
Bribed your cop, and ran off.
So you're accusing us?
No sir, I'm right, I'm not lying.
Search him... He has 500 rupees.
Check it out.
Hey, you're telling me
to search a policeman?
I don't understand.
Did you bring him in,
or did he bring you in?
- Exactly
I'm not lying sir...
Iook it's in his pocket.
You damn!
Look sir, wearing a uniform
and carrying a gun
Doesn't give you the right to abuse.
Hey asshole... lock him up...
- Come on...
Piece of shit... Where do
you find these idiots...
Hey Mister... there
was an accident here.
I know that. - They've taken
him to Khar Police Station.
Excuse me...
- Yes...
There was an accident
at National College...
Do you know where the driver is?
- Who are you?
Jai Mittal.
You're the one whose been
in the news all day?
You were to be in court...
what are you doing here?
Please tell me where he is,
I need to meet him.
It's him. He's the one who's
responsible for the accident.
Lock him up, send him
in here... it's him.
Go ahead.
Sir... Sir...
Sir handcuff him. - Ok...
Come on...
I'm here to get you out.
Why are you telling me?
Tell the cop.
He the one with the key
to this lock, not me...
Don't worry about that...
you open a lock for me...
I'll open one for you.
So you're talking properly now...
I knew you weren't here
for me, but for yourself.
There's no point arguing...
we can help each other.
Tell me... where is the key?
The key's with me...
but I can't take you anywhere
in my wrecked cab
I'm not talking about the key
that makes your car run...
I'm talking about the key
that makes my life run.
I don't have any such key.
Look, I've had enough
of your nonsense...
Look, don't stick your
finger in my face.
I asked nicely...
Or Enough sweet talk
Hurry up and tell me
where the key is...
Or I'll lock all the
doors to your life...
You'll lock them?
I've already locked your doors...
I threw your key in the sea.
Go on, jump from the
gateway of India to get it...
Even if you get the Navy to
help you... you won't find it
Sir, look at this.
Look what he's doing...
Move, hey whacko,
leave him...
What happened?
He has my key and
he won't return it.
He's proving how what a
low human being he is...
Yes. I've proved it.
I threw away your key.
Hey, one minute.
Search him.
You were telling me to search him.
Now he'll search you...
I'm still telling you,
he's got 500 in his pocket.
Shut up... just shut up...
Are you looking for
the key or the lock?
Stand straight, let me check...
Sir, I can't find anything.
Did you check properly?
I checked properly.
Didn't you see? There's nothing.
Come on out of there...
- This man is really wicked, inspector.
He has the key, but he's
making a fool of us.
But we checked in front of you.
He doesn't have the key, What can we do?
Go now... to the Gateway of India,
jump into the sea,
In your underwear, and
check if the key is there...
Hey... what do you think
you're doing?
Leave him, this is a police
station... go home...
Book him under as many cases
as possible. I'll pay for it.
Yes, ok... come on...
- Look, he got scared.
Once I'm out he'll be in trouble...
he's scared.
You talk too much.
What are you doing? Come on...
Look at him sir... see what
kind of person he is...
I'll fix you.
Put your finger down.
Shut up... just shut up.
Me... but he... look he
pulled the chair out too.
Will you just shut up?
How are you Mr. Batliwala? Fine?
Oh hello Mr. Mittal. Mr. Jai Mittal.
What happened to your voice?
How has it dropped so low,
with a low human being like me?
I think that maybe you've
misunderstood me.
I think that maybe you haven't
found your key...
Am I right Mr. Mittal?
Wow Mr. Batliwala... you're
honest, and smart too...
I should not have spoken
to you the way I did.
I should have apologized.
Sorry
Ok. It's ok Mr. Mittal...
Mr. Batliwala, now what?
Let me tell you a story, if
you don't mind. Do you mind?
No. No, sir.
Once upon a time, my wife
Dolly had a huge fight
With me, over money.
She abused me to her heart's content,
blabbing on and on,
Till, a short while later,
she cooled down completely...
From wild tigress to poor cow.
Then she apologized,
she asked for forgiveness...
She tried to butter me up,
she tried to seduce me...
But I still didn't give her the money.
So... what's the moral of the story?
And who is the bloody loser?
What happened?
- Don't ask...
Where are you taking us?
- Andheri police station.
Why?
What do you mean why?
From there you'll go to court...
Take me straight to court.
Why Andheri police station?
I won't go there.
Hey, quiet.
Enough of your chatter.
You took 500 rupees
from that guy.
Hey, shut up. 500 rupees,
500 rupees, 500 rupees...
Are you sure he has the key?
Trust me Rupali...
the way he was speaking...
The kind of person he is...
he has it.
If he wasn't in jail, I'd...
Hello
Hello, Rupali? Our case is up next.
Jai's coming right?
I hope he's not asleep...
Jai's with me... we're coming there,
Shivraj... but...
This time we have a genuine problem.
I'm handling things here,
butjust make sure he comes
Yes, we'll get the file and
be there right away...
Ok, just make sure he comes soon.
Look Jai, one way or another,
you have to get the key
from the taxi driver.
Time is running out Jai...
What do you want me to do?
I've been meeting crazy
people all day...
The vault guy, Batliwala,
and this taxi driver...
I can't help it, what do I do?
You tell me?
Understand one thing Jai.
You absolutely have to
appear in court today.
Otherwise, it's all over for you.
And for god's sake, just be calm.
I'll take a cab...
Here are my car keys...
just go there and sort this out.
Tell Shinde to register the
case at Andheri station...
I don't want any hassles here.
Hey, Mr. Mittal... Where are you going?
He's gone... He ran off.
What?
The taxi driver who was here...
Raghav Shastri...
We were taking him to the
police headquarters...
But he escaped enroute.
He snatched his hand
away and ran off...
What do you think you're doing?
An ordinary taxi driver ran off
and you couldn't catch him?
Give me his address...
64 Dattatreya Chawl, Andheri.
One cigarette please.
Today, since the morning...
...everyone is colliding
with each other.
Today is a very important day
for Mr. Jai Mittal. Today,
He will present to the court his
father's will, which states that
The entire estate of renowned
industrialist Shyam Mittal
Belongs to Jai Mittal...
but Mr. Arjun Bajaj claims that
There is no such will,
and that Jai Mittal is lying.
The outcome of this ongoing
succession battle depends
Entirely on this will.
If Jai Mittal produces the will,
He could inherit his father's wealth.
Otherwise not...
They're packed in here
like sardines...
One second...
Brother, where's number 64?
- Upstairs, this way? - Ok.
My god Rupali... what a character.
Raghav Shastri?
I haven't smelled such
delicious cooking
since my mother died.
Home food always smells good...
whoever makes it.
Thank you.
Do you have some business
with Raghu?
Actually I was in the
taxi with him today...
Taxi? Raghu's not the type
to spend money on cabs...
He even rides the bus without
a ticket sometimes...
No... I mean I was in his cab.
He was driving the cab,
I was in the backseat...
But unfortunately we got
in an accident, and-
Something of mine
got left with him
I think you've got the wrong address.
My husband is an insurance agent,
not a taxi driver.
Your husband's name is
Raghav Shastri? - Yes
So I'm at the right place.
Listen, you've got the name
right, but the job wrong.
He sells insurance policies...
he doesn't drive a cab
Look, Madam...
I'll start at the beginning-
This morning your husband
was driving a taxi,
That taxi got in an accident...
Neither of us got hurt, but the
taxi's quite badly damaged.
After that he got in a fight,
so the cops took him in...
Now the problem is that your
husband is upset with me...
And so he's not
returning my things.
Now you listen to me...
my husband may talk badly
to me at times, but-
he never lies.
Look madam, I have nothing
to do with your husband...
All I care about is my stuff.
Please give me his phone number.
Since you claim that he's been
picked up by the police...
Why don't you go there and see him?
I went there. But he had escaped...
- What?
Please give me his mobile number
- No... I'll call myself.
And if what you are saying
is at all true...
You may or may not recover your
things, but after today,
You will not see my
things in this house.
His phone seems to be turned
off... take the number...
Yes, go ahead.
98215-51535
Ok.
Hello? Raghav Shastri?
- Yes. - This is Jai Mittal...
I know. - Listen to me,
listen to me...
Listen Raghav, what happened
was very unfortunate,
I went to your house too...
I've unwittingly created
another problem for you.
Look Raghav, I'm willing
to try to help sort out
your problems
I'll get you a job in the
Life insurance corporation,
And I'll arrange for 10
policies to be bought
Through you. I'll talk to
your wife on your behalf.
I'll organize whatever you
want to set up your life...
I want life imprisonment-
- Once you're dead.
Will you organize that?
What? Hello?
Raghav? Hello?
Raghav Shastri...
now let the games begin...
You want to play dirty,
we'll play dirty...
Play whatever you want...
I'll play along.
I'm ready.
Let's see where this goes.
"Dissolved in the veins,
it inebriates."
"But once addicted,
it turns into suffering."
"It fills... it drains."
"It does everything."
"It is embers, it is lightening!
This city is the dream of every heart!"
