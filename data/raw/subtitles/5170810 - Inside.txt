So what are we gonna name her?
I don't know. How about Zoey?
- Really?
- [MATT] Yeah.
- No, I don't think so.
- [MATT] It's sweet.
Why not?
It starts with a Z, she'll
always be last in the class.
Um... Beatrice.
- What?
- Hey, I had an Aunt Bea, be nice.
An aunt?
- Yeah.
- Come on, are you kidding me?
How about... how about Anna?
- Anna?
- Yeah?
- No.
- No?
That's just not...
[SARAH]
She just kicked... feel it.
[MATT] What?

[GYNECOLOGIST]
See how her heart's beating?
She's just perfect, Sarah.
Except for some internal
scrapes, all is well.
I'm more worried about you.
No, er... it's okay.
I'm ready.
[GYNECOLOGIST] Okay...
have you started to feel
any contractions?
No, I don't think so.
Is... is that bad?
Unusual... it's getting late.
We can wait a couple of days,
but...
Thank you.
...if nothing happens in that
amount of time...
No, no, I... I don't want
to be cut open.
I want to do this myself.
Relax... we'll try inducing it.
We'll give you some oxytocin.
It's a hormone that accelerates
the contractions.
What it does is it tells the
baby it's time to come out.
Is there anybody that can give
you a ride in?
It'd be better if you didn't
drive.
I don't drive any more.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, it's... it's okay.
My mom arrives tonight, so...
Good.
Well, get as much rest
as you can.
Merry Christmas.

ANNOUNCER (OVER RADIO):
And this carol brings...
our program to an end on what
is the warmest Christmas...
that I remember.
Don't forget, we'll be back
with you tomorrow...
at the same time, from 4:00 pm
until 8:00.
[DRIVER] First time anybody ever
asked me to take them...
out to this neighborhood.
It's new.
Sunshine Grove. Who comes up
with these names?
All sound the same to me.
I took some guy from a bank out
to some residential...
neighborhood last week,
way up northeast...
Green Sunshine.

Hi, Mum.
I was at the doctor's office,
I had it on silent and I forgot.
Er... yes, I'm fine.
I'm just... tired.
Okay. I will leave, uh...
a key in the mailbox by the
garden gate for you.
All right, yes, I am sure that
I'm okay, I promise.
I'm doing everything
that I'm supposed to do...
per doctor's orders, so you
don't have to worry, okay?
Bye, Mum.

Hi! Hi! Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Isaac, it's perfect, thank you.
You know you didn't have
to do this.
It's just a little something,
so that when you wake up...
every hour with the baby crying,
you'll think of us.
I... I have something for you,
too.
Oh, great!
Oh, Sarah, it's... beautiful.
Matt took it the day
that we met you.
I found it while I was going
through some of his things...
and we'd always wanted you
and Brian to have it.
Brian's gonna love it.
I remember this day.
Good God!
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Ah!
What are you doing?
And now, whenever Brian calls
me, this picture shows up.
(PHONE RINGING)
Excuse me.
Hello? No.
No, he's not, no, he didn't...
he's just not coming back...
ever.
Thank you.
Matt's name is still on the
phone line...
so sometimes companies call
and ask for him...
to try to get him to switch
service providers.
I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.
Part of me almost likes it when
people call and ask for him.
It's nice to hear his name,
even if only for a second.
Isaac... I've decided to sell
the house.
I just... I think it's best
with everything...
that's going on and the baby.
I think it's better if I go and
stay with my mum for a while.
I don't know.
I don't think I'm capable
of doing this by myself.
I don't have the strength.
You know, we're here for you,
whatever you need.
I know, but it's not that.
Isaac, I'm scared.
I'm scared that I won't
know what to do.
I'm scared that I'm going
to be a bad mother...
and I'm all alone.
Sarah, nobody teaches you
to be a good mother.
Either you've got it or you
don't...
and believe me, you have got it.
Sorry. Don't be alarmed, I was
bound to cry.
Hey, you know you're invited
to have dinner with us tonight.
This neighborhood becomes a
ghost town on nights like this.
I'd love to have you.
Please.
Thank you.
And I am so grateful for you
and Brian and how you've been...
there for me, but tonight...
I don't feel much like
celebrating.

Hello?
Isaac, is that you?
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
I-I can see you.
[WOMAN] Sorry to bother you
on Christmas Eve...
I have a problem with my car,
I need to make a phone call.
I'm sorry, I don't quite
understand.
I need to make a phone call.
Don't you have a cell phone
you could use?
[WOMAN] The battery ran out.
What happened?
[WOMAN] Like I said, I have
a problem with my car...
please, could you open the door?
You know what, my uh...
my husband is sleeping...
I don't want to wake him.
[WOMAN] I won't make any noise.
It would just take a minute...
please!
You know, I think it's best
if you just try next door.
[WOMAN] There's nobody in...
please, it will just take
a second.
No... no, I'm sorry, I just
told you my husband is asleep.
I'm not opening the door.
[WOMAN] Why are you lying?
Excuse me?
[WOMAN] Your husband isn't
sleeping, Sarah. He's dead.
- (BANGING ON DOOR)
- Open the door, Sarah!
Look, I don't know who you are
and I don't know what you want.
But you better leave, I'm
calling the police right now.
Do you hear me?
Where did she go?
(EXCALIBUR BARKS)
Excalibur!
What are you barking at, boy?
Yes, hi, um, my name
is Sarah Clark.
I live in Sunshine Grove,
number 10 Oak Crest.
I would like to report a strange
woman lurking outside my house.
No, I don't know who she is.
I've never seen her before.
Please, can you come quickly?
I'm inside.
Okay, I will. Thank you.
Isaac, it's Sarah, um...
something's wrong.
A strange woman just came
to the house...
and she wanted to come inside.
I've never seen her before.
I've called the police.
They're on their way,
but call me back, okay?
(KETTLE WHISTLING)
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Hi.
- Ma'am.
- Sarah Clark?
- Yes.
- We received a call.
It was me. Um... there was
a strange woman here.
She wanted to come inside
the house.
Inside the house?
Yes, she was banging
on the door.
I don't know what she wanted.
Anybody else at home
with you, ma'am?
- No.
- Any idea who that woman was?
No, sorry, I... I didn't get
a good look at her.
You see, the light is broken.
Well, it... it wasn't working
when she was here.
I'm gonna take a look out back.
You're sure it was a woman?
I mean, you got to see
her face properly?
Any other detail?
No, I didn't get to see
her face. It was too dark.
But I heard her voice,
it was definitely a woman.
It's clean, there's nobody
out there.
Whoever it was, is gone.
Well, don't worry, ma'am.
I don't think she will
come back.
It's probably someone who had
too much to drink.
Anyway, I will inform
the neighborhood patrol car...
and get them to drive
by later on...
and make sure everything
is okay.
Well, thank you, then, um,
I'll walk you out.

(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

Sarah?
Isaac.
I'm Sarah's mother... she's
told me so much about you.
Oh, I'm so sorry to walk
in on you like this.
She gave us the keys,
just in case.
[ISAAC] Is she okay?
[ISAAC] She called, but we
weren't able...
to get to the phone on time.
(HEART BEATING)
(HIGH-PITCHED TONE)
She's exhausted, the poor thing.
Oh, it has been so tough on her.
But she is tough.
She'll pull through.
Yes, she will.
And I told her that very thing
just this afternoon.
But then of course, we got
the message on my cell...
saying something about somebody
wanting to get into the house.
Of course, we were worried...
worried little neighbors.
Brian and me.
I'm assuming Sarah mentioned
him to you, maybe not.
Yes, she did.
How silly of me, I'm sorry.
Thank you so much for coming by,
really.
It was nothing, she was just
jumpy.
(HEART BEATING)
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
It's been a difficult few months
for her.
Oh, I know.
But we are just so happy...
to have a little new neighbor
on the way.
It'll certainly cheer things
up around here.
Yes... it's a shame she's giving
it up for adoption.
Oh, she didn't tell you?
I'm so sorry.
No, she mentioned it.
I just didn't know she had
decided.
- Mm.
- Well...
It's very kind of you
to drop in, really.
I'll tell her that you called
on her, and can I walk you out?
(HIGH-PITCHED TONE)
Well, we won't bother you
any longer.
And you live...?
Right next door.
And sorry again
for barging in like I did.
Who...?
Who are you? Did something
happen to Sarah?
Maybe you should tell us
who you are first.
I'm her mother. Is something
the matter?
Sarah?
Sarah is sleeping.
Sarah! Sarah!
Sarah!

what I think you just said.

Uh... I saw the car light.
That's okay, ma'am.
We just drove by to make sure
you were okay.
The precinct told us that
somebody'd been bothering you.
I haven't had any problems.
I got scared, I suppose.
Sure.
Thank you for coming.
No problem, ma'am,
just doing my duty.

Well, don't hesitate...
to pick up the phone if you
notice anything strange, okay?
- Good night, ma'am.
- Good night.

she'd gone into labor...
and you were playing midwife
back there.

is upstairs. We need to leave.
What are you talking about?
I don't know who she is.
She's crazy.
She wants my baby,
can't you see I'm...
- That's enough! That's enough!
- I'm pregnant and I'm hurt.
We're going upstairs.
Go! Go on!
Go!
