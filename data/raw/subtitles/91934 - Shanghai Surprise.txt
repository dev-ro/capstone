A MR. WU Ch'En SHE?             
                OH, SHH, SHH!   
WHY DOES EVERYBODY              
GET THEIR PECKERS IN A VISE     
WHEN YOU MENTION WU Ch'En SHE?  
            THE GENTLEMAN IS    
            A RENEGADE SWINDLER 
            AND A CHEAT.        
    THAT ALL THEY HAVE          
    AGAINST HIM?                
    HE OWES MOST OF THOSE MEN   
    MONEY FROM GAMBLING DEBTS.  
AN ACT OF EXTREME DISHONOR.     
THEY WOULD KILL HIM ON SIGHT.   
NOW, I PERSONALLY DO NOT KNOW   
THE GENTLEMAN'S WHEREABOUTS,    
        BUT... FOR A SMALL FEE, 
            I CAN TAKE YOU      
            TO SOMEONE WHO DOES.
     YES.

I COULD DO THE ARMPITS,         
THE GENITALS AND BOTH ANKLES,   
        BUT I COULD NOT FIND    
        WU Ch'En SHE.

SURELY YOU WISH TO PROTECT      
YOUR HAVEN OF CELESTIAL BLISS?  
- HOW DARE YOU!                 
- I DON'T THINK HER HAVEN'S     
  IN MUCH DANGER.               
MR. WASEY, I DEMAND WE CONCLUDE 
OUR BUSINESS HERE.              
OKAY. SHE'LL TAKE THE EARS,     
THE LIPS                        
AND THE TWIN PAGODAS.

WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS TUB,     
I'M GONNA BEAT YOU              
LIKE A REDHEADED STEPCHILD.     
        WHY? I SAVED YOUR LIFE. 
            I TOOK YOU          
            TO THE RED SOCIETY, 
    AN ORGANIZATION WITH        
     AN IRONIC SENSE OF HUMOR.  
        HAD I DELIVERED YOU     
        TO THE GREEN SOCIETY,

            YOUR THROAT,

             LIKE A PEKING DUCK.
FOR LOOKING FOR THE FATHER      
OF A WOUNDED SOLDIER?           
        OH. HMM, INTERESTING.   
INTERESTING? WHAT'S             
SO GODDAMN INTERESTING?         
    MY DEAR FRIEND,             
    WU Ch'En SHE HAS NO SONS.   
SO, THEN, WHY                   
AM I LOOKING FOR HIM?           
        PERHAPS YOU SHOULD ASK  
        THE PIOUS LADY.         
    EVERY GODDAMN WORD          
    OUT OF YOUR MOUTH HAS BEEN  
    A LIE, HASN'T IT?           
LET ME EXPLAIN.                 
    THERE ISN'T ANY BRAVE BOY   
    CRYING FOR WU Ch'En SHE.    
         IS THERE?              
         LOOK ME IN THE EYE     
         AND GIVE ME AN ANSWER! 
NO, THERE ISN'T.                
            NO, THERE ISN'T.    
        A MISSIONARY LYING!     
        IT'S LIKE PISSING       
        ALL OVER GOD'S UNIFORM. 
IF I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH,        
YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE AGREED     
TO HELP US.                     
- HELP YOU WHAT?                
- AT THIS VERY MOMENT, TENS     
  OF THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS...   
ARE SUFFERING PAIN BECAUSE      
OF A SHORTAGE OF MORPHINE.      
    AND NOT ONE OF THEM         
    IS RELATED TO WU Ch'En SHE. 
THAT'S TRUE.                    
BUT A YEAR AGO, WU Ch'En SHE    
BETRAYED WALTER FARADAY--       
         HOLD THE PHONE.        
         THE WALTER FARADAY?    
            WALTER FARADAY,     
            THE OPIUM KING?     
THEY SAY WU STOLE 1,100 POUNDS  
OF OPIUM FROM THIS MR. FARADAY. 
    - YOU'RE LOOKING            
      FOR FARADAY'S FLOWERS.    
    - HEARD OF 'EM?             
    I'VE ALSO HEARD OF EL DORADO
    AND THE LOST DUTCHMAN MINE. 
    THEY DON'T EXIST EITHER.    
    YOU'RE CRAZY. YOU KNOW THAT?
        YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID  
        TO WALTER FARADAY?      
            ANSWER ME, DAMN IT! 
I CAN'T. IT SMELLS SO BAD,      
 I CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT.        
    AFTER THEY SHOT HIM,        
    DROWNED HIM AND BURNED HIM, 
        THEY SAY HE WAS FISHED  
        OUT OF THE RIVER,       
        SKINNED AND DEBONED,    
        AND THEN HUNG UP        
        FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE.   
IT'S ONLY HEARSAY.              
IF THEY'LL DO THAT, CAN YOU     
IMAGINE WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO TO
THE GLOW-IN-THE-DARK TIE KING?  
            I'LL BE SEEING YOU, 
            MISS TATLOCK.       
        WHAT ABOUT YOUR TIES?   
WHAT ABOUT 'EM?                 
        MR. BURNS HAS THEM      
        STORED AT THE MISSION.  
        YOU'RE WELCOME          
        TO FOLLOW ME THERE,     
        BUT PLEASE WALK UPWIND. 
        [ Sniffing ]            
OH, DEAR. I SENSE               
YOU'VE ENCOUNTERED              
THE RED SOCIETY.                
            I'M AFRAID HE KNOWS.
    NO PHONY APOLOGIES, PAL.    
    I JUST WANT MY STUFF.       
        YOU MUST THINK          
        WE'RE LUNATICS.         
LUNATICS? YOU ARE WORSE         
THAN LUNATICS.

A GLOW-IN-THE-DARK TIE SALESMAN 
DO NOT STROLL UP TO PEOPLE...   
AND ASK IF THEY'VE SEEN         
A THOUSAND POUNDS OF OPIUM      
LYING AROUND.                   
            TOLD YOU WE PICKED  
            THE WRONG MAN.      
    SHHH.                       
THIS TIME THEY THREW US         
IN THE FISH. NEXT TIME WE GET   
GRINDED INTO CAT FOOD.          
HE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW.           
I'M AFRAID WE'VE BEEN           
HOPELESSLY IRRESPONSIBLE.       
    PERHAPS THIS                
    WILL MAKE UP FOR IT.

    FOR THIS EVENING, MR. WASEY?
    NO. NO, I DON'T.            
    WELL, WE CAN'T HAVE YOU     
    LEAVING SHANGHAI WITHOUT    
    TASTING THE DUCK.           
    WILL YOU HAVE DINNER        
    WITH ME TONIGHT? MY TREAT.  
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT               
OFFENDED, BUT THAT NEW TIE      
IS A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT.         
    A LITTLE SUBDUED FOR ME.

    OH, WHAT A COINCIDENCE!     
    COULD THIS POSSIBLY BE

I HADN'T THE FOGGIEST IDEA      
HOW TO HELP YOU BEFORE,

I THINK SHE'D BE AMUSED,        
DON'T YOU, KRONK?

- WHO? WHO?                     
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU

I'M SORRY, BUT MR. WASEY        
ISN'T HERE TO PARTICIPATE--     
                    NO. WAIT.   
SHE IS VERY SELECTIVE,          
AND HE IS DEFINITELY HER TYPE.  
AND SHE WORKS OFF THE PREMISES. 
    BUT WE DON'T HAVE           
    THE TIME OR THE MONEY.      
            SHE BELIEVES        
            SHE'S AN EMPRESS.   
            THE FORTUNATE PATRON
            BECOMES HER EMPEROR.
                AN EMPEROR?     
                [ Laughs ]      
I ABSOLUTELY FORBID THIS!       
HER NAME IS CHINA DOLL, AND     
SHE'S WALTER FARADAY'S MISTRESS.
HOW MUCH WILL IT COST AND       
WHEN CAN WE PAY OUR FIRST VISIT?
THIS COULD BE A SETUP.          
                DON'T BE SILLY. 
TUTTLE COULD BE                 
ON SOME GANG'S PAYROLL.

        TO HELP US AND THEN     
        TURN AROUND AND HURT US?

    AND IF CERTAIN PEOPLE

WHY SHOULD I TELL YOU ANYTHING? 
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?           
        ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW... 
    IS THAT I'M A PERSON WHO    
    CAN CAUSE YOU INTENSE PAIN.

I GOT A PASSPORT REGISTERED     
WITH THE U.S. CONSULATE.

    THERE WAS ONCE AN EMPEROR   
    NAMED CH'ENG HUANG WHO RULED
    DURING THE CH'IN DYNASTY.   
HIS POLICE CAUGHT A PEDDLER     
STEALING ROSES FROM THE ROYAL   
GARDENS ONE AFTERNOON.          
    THEY CHOPPED OFF HIS HEAD   
    ON THE SPOT.                
        WHEN THE EMPEROR HEARD  
        ABOUT THE INCIDENT,     
                HE WAS FURIOUS  
                AT THE LENIENCY 
                OF THE SENTENCE.
    COME ON. LOOK.              
I'LL TELL YOU ANYTHING          
YOU WANT TO KNOW.               
     INDEED YOU WILL, MR. WASEY,
    BUT WE MUST BE CERTAIN      
    IT'S THE TRUTH.             
         IN YOUR COUNTRY,

THAT AN ALERT PERSON IS SOMEONE 
WHO IS ALWAYS ON HIS TOES.

    A TALENT FOR REMAINING...

THE PHOENIX HAS ALWAYS BEEN     
A SYMBOL OF BENEVOLENCE.
