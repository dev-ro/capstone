"What did we do to God?" 
 (Serial bad weddings)
Paris, six months later...
It's going to be a bloodbath! 
- No they got the best Rabbi.
He'll cut my grandson's penis! 
 - Please Claude...
 Make an effort! 
 I would prefer to be in Chinon right now too!
I'm not sure I can watch it!
I watched an awful documentary on TV about 
 female genital mutilations in Mali and I...
Hello everybody. 
 - Hello Marie, hello Claude.
How was your trip? 
 - Good thank you.
I look like a tank! 
 - No you look radiant. 
 Sublime!
Did you choose a name? 
 - No we haven't decided  yet.
We're hesitating between Antoine, Lucas or ... 
 - Mahmoud.
Mahmoud?
Yeah I like Mahmoud. What about you?
All of them are nice... 
 I probably prefer Lucas and Antoine tho...
Me too... Mahmoud it's not an easy name...
It sounds like mammoth!
Great atmosphere...
You're silly! 
 - He almost had a heart attack!
I swear I have not converted to Judaism!
I hope you didn't! 
 - Why don't you baptize him?
Benjamin may like to be Catholic later!
Mom, for the last time.... 
 circumcision doesn't makes him a Jew. And it is hygienic!
so you avoid infections. 
 - Mine is still intact and I'm totally healthy.
Claude please! 
 - Hello dear father and mother in-law!
Good luck....
Listen Chao, stop calling me like that! 
 It makes me nervous.
I'm sorry I won't do it again. 
 - Hi honey..
Hey Marie. 
 - Hey Chao.
When do you go back to Chinon? 
 - Tomorrow night.
Let's have a family lunch tomorrow!
Great idea! I will cook a specialty from my country.
A steamed Dim Zum!
It was a joke... 
 - It is going to start!!!
Circumcision... 
 - No need to rush...
Those lame jokes... 
- This Thai accent was so stupid...
Ah ok ...
Ugh! Poor little baby! It's really horrible.
Weird taste....This champagne must be kosher.
It's itching ! 
 Finish your glass I want to shower in the hotel!
Claude, Marie! That's for you!
Thanks David, what is it? 
 - Benjamin's foreskin!
That's a great honor for you you know...
I guess...What should we do with it? 
 - Traditionally you bury the foreskin in the family yard.
We don't have one so you can bury it in your yard.
If it is so important why did you cut it off?
My husband was joking, give me this foreskin! 
 - Thanks Marie!
It will go under the apple tree.
You do not like it Marie? 
 - Yes Chao it is quite tasty.
Just a little bit dry. 
 - That's the least you can say...
What meat is it? 
 - Ostrich.
Ostrich? 
 - Usually I cook with pork it's less dry but...
Yes of course...
 I don't eat pork but I am not an Islamist !
Look! I drink wine. 
 - But I was not worried...
So do I. No pork ! 
 You know.. It's a millenary tradition.
Well I'm from Auvergne 
 but I'm not going to eat Aligot (Cheezy potatoes) every day!
What nonsense Daddy !
C'mon I was just joking! I teased them only.
Ah ah ah! Very funny Claude!
What a kiss ass...
Oh Benjamin is awake! 
 - Can I see him? 
 Sure Mom.
Girls, do you still eat pork?
Don't worry, I'm still a good little Frenchwoman.
Rabbit! Rabbit! 
 How cute! Always smiling! He doesn't look traumatized at least.
Of course Marie, it was painless. 
 Painless?
His foreskin was cut! It wasn't really sweet!
Sorry David but.. I think it's almost barbaric!
Claude, after 8 days the nervous system 
 of the child is not mature yet.
That's why we, Jews, do it at this age. 
 Unlike the Muslims! They do it at  6 years old!!
What are you assuming David? 
 That Muslims are barbarians?
No he just said the earlier the better. 
 - But this tone was not necessary!
Sorry Isabelle. But he must have suffered like hell !
Imagine! They cut your fucking dick at 6 years old !!
Seriously Rachid, it was painful right? 
 - Not at all! It's a good memory!
I would do it again tomorrow. 
 - What an hypocrite !
Stop the Jews/Arabs fights ! 
 Cant' you make peace for one day?
That's not your business. Let us argue!
Absolutely Rachid. We communicate at least.
Unlike Chinese people! You never know what they think! 
 - What do you mean?
Chinese are deceitful? 
 - No I'm just saying Chinese make no effort to approach others! Right?
Joker.
No idea. Except Chao I don't know any Chinese guys.
I agree with David. Neither a smile nor a hello.
Since the Chinese bought all the tobacco shops 
 I'm almost done with smoking!
At least Arab shopkeepers have commercial skills!
No commercial skills really? 
 Chinese took over the Sentier to Jews and Belleville to Arabs neighborhoods!
They're good! Admit it David!
Jews gone bankrupt because of the Chinese!
Shall we talk about something else?
Are you going on holiday? 
 - No because I need to prepare my exposition.
Darling your paintings look more and more happy ...
C'mon Claude, you know she is hyper emotional. 
 - Hey I can hear you Mom!
I'm not hyper emotional I'm just sensitive. 
 - I know honey I know...
Mom, what did you do last night? 
 - We ate in Montmartre
In a small local bistro! 
 - Great! Give me the address.
Of course... 
 - Great? We were lost in Barbès on our way back... Very local too!
What do you mean by local? 
 - Rachid don't be angry...
...but for people from the countryside like us, Barbès is a shock !
Luckily I had my passport because I felt like 
 I was in Bab El Oued !
You can't say that Dad! 
- But it's a fact! There was no Frenchman in the streets!
How did you know they were not French? 
 Did you ask their ID ?
What's this tone Rachid? Can't we argue quietly?
Do you call that a debate? 
 Since the beginning your comments have been controversial !
Controversial? 
 - Yes like on the verge....
On the verge of being racist! 
 - Racist? Me?
But I am Republican and Gaullist like my father !
Calm down Claude. 
 - I'm calm but I can't accept being called a racist!
Of my four daughters I offered 3 to 
 sons of immigrants !
And you? What did you do for France?
So first you didn't "offer" us! Second, General De Gaulle 
 is dead! Three, calm down!
Marie we go home to Chinon now! 
- But Claude ...
Please stay for the dessert. 
 - No thanks I do not like lychees !
There is no lychee ...
These people are so irritable!
It was like a LICRA (Anti Racism) meeting, not a lunch!
They aren't really nice... 
 - I can't see them!
Chao what a kiss ass! 
 His laugh! Sounds like a chick that is going to be killed.
I have a hard time with David. 
 Odile deserved better.
Much better! Such an intelligent girl. 
 He is just a loser living at her expense.
I thought Jews were good for business. 
 Apparently not all of them...
The most difficult is Rachid. 
 - He's the worst! So irritable!
We have really won the Jackpot darling...
My damned Norman cake !
I'm ashamed. 
 - Me too.
Do not take it too seriously. You know dad... 
 He needs to be provocative...
Try to understand him, a countryman in  Barbès! 
 It's like "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" !
Really? What if he had called the 13th district 
  Beijing ?
There are only Chinese people there, it's a fact !
 But if he had called all Arabs thieves...
 Thieves? 
 - Darling...
Hey I don't think that...I tried to think like a racist guy.
 - You stop !  Don't do it again ok?
What if I say Asian have small dicks ?
 - What? 
 - Enough !
How can you be so foolish?
She really needs to find a guy !
Let's forget it! Chao made a delicious Normandy Tart! 
 Want some?
No thanks we have to go... 
 - Us too. Benjamin is tired.
Why did you park like this? 
 - I didn't... This car probably pushed mine into yours...
Are you fucking kidding me? This car was already here! 
 We're stuck !
What a fucking dumb ass! 
 - Are you calling me a dumb ass for this? You're the dumb ass!
Enough kids! 
 - Come back for dessert! My cake is delicious
If it's as dry as your ostrich you can shove it! 
- What?
- David stop being so vulgar! 
 - It's his fault! He ruined the atmosphere with his references about pork!
Why didn't you cook noodles fucking jackass?
Now it's going to be bad...
David you know what? 
 Forget our appointment with my bank.
You can go fuck yourself with your vintage phone project!
Do you think I need you? I have more contacts 
 in banks than you'll ever have. You're a joke!
Hey get with the present. Times have changed! 
 Jews in finance? It's over! Now it's the Chinese!
We are taking over!  We're about to buy 
 everything! Deauville, the Kippa and even Israel!
I swear on my Grandmother's grave I'm going to punch you in the face! 
 - Come my Falafel!
Five years of Krav Maga you'll feel it!
Aren't you going to do something? 
 - If I do something I'd destroy both of them! 
 - Really...
Are you fucking crazy? 
 - I just defended myself!
Hey! I'm not a Tibetan! 
 - Throat attack, that's typical Chinese...
Hey my little Clovis here we come. Mom and Dad are home!
You're hungry. We are too.
We ate really bad Chinese food. 
 - It was awful indeed..
It tasted like rubber.
Bury a foreskin what nonsense! This belongs in a dump!
They gave us one assignment.It is religious it's sacred.
Religious sacred...
Where's the box?
Disgusting ! 
 - Put it back in the box!
Ugh! I can't touch it!
Clovis stay away!
This idiot just ate the foreskin!
He loved it...
Well let's go... 
 - Don't think about it !
Besides Clovis, you and I no one will ever know.
No traces! Voila! Hop!
We did what they asked.
I'm going to have a whisky now. A little whisky.
"Chinon eighteen months later"
Everything is all right Ms Verneuil. You have  
 arteries of a 20 years old lady!
It's not possible! I don't eat, I sleep all time. 
 I must have something.
It's in your head.
You have all the symptoms of depression.
I think you should see a specialist.
A specialist?
You mean a psychologist?
Father? 
 Oh God... not her!
I dedicated my whole life to my daughters,
I sacrified everything to make them happy.
For what? For not seeing them no more. 
 I barely know my grandchildren...
Life is complicated enough so if you add cultural,
religious and education problems it's...
We talked about it already Ms Verneuil. It's normal, it's globalization! 
 You'll adapt !
Look, my bishop is Malagasy... It wasn't easy at first 
 but now everything's great!
I know Doctor... I mean Father !
I feel bad to think this way. But I wanted to marry 
 them in this church.
It's here where I was married, where my 
 parents were married too!
Where my aunt Geneviève made her Communion...
273 Euros? This is overpriced!
What? Sorry? 
 _ Nothing...
I was thinking to your last one Laure right? 
 Right.
She'll may be marry a Catholic! Keep the faith! 
 Amen Father!
What are you doing? 
 Don't disturb me please!
I'm writing a speech about the wedding contract 
 modification for the Community of Acquisition
It's a really important contribution that I want to do 
 before the annual Notaries Meeting.
Ok, no need to be rude. Not today.
I saw the Doctor and 
 - And?
I have a depression. 
 - Whew! I was worried it was serious.
But depression can really be serious!
Of course ! I'm sorry Darling !
I miss my daughters you know! 
- Yes, yes.... I know
What about invite them for Christmas?
 Who?
Our daughters, their husbands, their children. 
 I need to see them.
But do you remember what happened last time?
It was a little bit our fault too with our 
 negative stereotypes...
Before asking them to understand us we should 
 make a step toward them! 
 - What?
Listen Darling I'm sorry but we've already tried so many times.
These efforts are probably a cause of your depression!
Do you think so?
Kosher market is growing! Organic market too!
Both together is going to be a success!
It's going to be a flop.
Flop? 
 - Flop!
There are about 600,000 Jews in France. Among them 
 20% eat Kasher...
More... 
 Ok let's say 30%, it makes 180,000
10% of them maximum eat organic, right? 
 Not even 20,000 potential clients!
Your business is a micro market. 
 You should rather apply for a microcredit...
Bravo! 
- Do you eat Kosher by the way? 
 No...
Neither your Mom? 
- She died 6 months ago... 
- Ah! She won't eat at all !
Sorry... 
 - Leave!
Motherfucker!
Yes Darling? 
 _ How was your appointment?
Bad as usual... 
 - Don't give up! BioMitzvah is a great concept!
Just 2 seconds Monsieur Berger...
I have a good news! We go on vacation for Christmas! 
 - We're going to ski ?
No, we'll go to Chinon with the family. 
- This is GOOD news ?
Jacky Chan and Arafat will be there too?
Well! Have a good day see you later love.
Here I come Monsieur Berger!
Hey there is no proof I had Hashish. 
 I'm innocent!
No proof, but you're not innocent yet! 
 So let me defend you and stay quiet...
Ok brother. 
 - Oh! I'm not your bro, I'm your lawyer!
Lawyer? I eat those avocados (French homonym for lawyer)
Hello Darling?
Still in Bobigny... 
- How's it going?
-Pfff ... Another brainless hooded guy.
What? Christmas with your parents?
Oh fuck! Hold on...
Is this being quiet?
Hey what are you doing bro? 
 Fuck off...
Excuse me Darling, I was with the brainless dude.
So who's coming for Christmas?
Bruce Lee and Popeck?
Gaddafi and Enrico Macias will be there? 
 - It's not funny, my Mom is depressed...
Oh sorry...
Girls have you heard? 
 You'll meet your aunts and uncles!
Sorry Mom I was busy, couldn't call you back...
Yes I know, I got Odile's text...
Of course I'll come it's a great idea!
Have a good night and kiss Dad for me.
It was my Mom... 
 - I know... 
 - She wants all the family for Christmas.
Am I invited?
Well... soon! Probably next Christmas.
So a Chinese, a Jew, an Arab it's ok but not a Black?
It's like "Marriage for Everyone" except for Africans? 
 - Idiot...
You know, I didn't meet your family yet too!
Oh... There is no problem on my side! 
 They just live for away, otherwise....
My parents are very tolerant!
You know, in Africa doors are open! Everybody can come!
No White, no Black but Human first! 
 - I'm sorry Charles...
The problem is that you come after the 3 others... 
 - Yeah...
Be patient, I need to prepare them to this shock. 
 - Am I the shock?
Yes you are! You're my shock! 
 My chocolate!
My little yogurt!
Get ride of your clothes!
Josianne! I'm going to Tours for grocery. 
 - Ok Madame!
Hello Madame. 
 - Hello Sir. 
 - What would you like?
A turkey please.
Excuse me, it's Halal right?
Yes Madame, everything is Halal here!
"Even the old rich women convert to Islam..."
"This country is really fucked up!"
Let me escort you to the door.
Thanks a lot Madame. 
 Shabbat Shalom!
Thank you! Shalabat Shalom to you! 
 - Thanks...
Hello! I would like to talk with the cook.
Sanitation Control? 
 -Oh no... I just need a tip for a recipe!
Good evening Darling. 
 - Good evening! I'm cooking a soup.
Darling, I met the Dupuy-Jambard family this afternoon.
Their son Xavier is at Chinon for Christmas. 
 I thought he was in Washington DC...
Yes but he comes back here for Christmas.
Why are you talking about him? 
 - Guess...
Well, Laure and Xavier it could work! 
 Xavier Dupuy-Jambard?
He's so ugly !
You don't know what you want! He's from Touraine 
 he's Catholic and from a good family!
And not that ugly! 
 He has character this is what matters for a man !
Xavier Dupuy-Jambard...
Hurry up you'll miss your plane!
Oh I forgot...
Mademoiselle Laure Verneuil would you like 
 to marry me, Charles Koffi the first?
Are you serious?
Yes! I don't want to be the illegal of the family no more!
I accept!
I have to go. 
 - I love you!
Hey you have no choice it's official now! 
 You have to tell your family!
Merry Christmas Darling!
I'm just asking you not to talk about Tobbacco shops! 
 Ok ok...
If someone says something stereotypical about Jews, like they're 
 over represented in the media or dentists, ignore them ok?
Ok, but...
...the first who provokes me about Israel, 
 I'll fuck him up!
Can't you stop with all these "fuck"? 
 Fuck, Motherfuckers, On my grandfather's grave...
This is vulgar! Do you understand? This is shocking for my parents! 
 - What can I say? "Jesus Christ" ?
Rachid... let's be short, if someone associates immigration and crimes, 
 please don't react! Don't say anything ok?
So you're asking me to be a coward, right? 
 - No! Just be cool and relax!
Be smart. Is this possible? 
 - It's green...
What if someone jokes about Chinese? What shall I do? 
 - Well, you smile...
So I play the Chinese actually, right? 
 - Exactly...
Claude, avoid all sensitive topics ok? 
 Israel, the Dalaï Lama, the burqa...
Yes, yes, yes... 
 - Above all, not a word about the French Football Team! 
 - Yes, yes...
Voilà! As if it was its normal place!
Ah! The first guests! 
 - I bet 20 Euros it's the Chinese...
Don't start please! Put on your tie.
Oh C'mon! We're not welcoming Queen Elizabeth!
I won! 
 You owe me 20 Euros Darling!
Charles!
3 hours late! Last time with 
 Royal Air Maroc!
My baby! 
 - How are you Mom? Sup sister?
How're you Dad? 
 - So you're living with Catherine Deneuve?
What a snitch!
You promised to invite me to Paris! I'm still waiting 
 for the ticket! My bags have been packed since 1920!
I was going to tell you! Her name is Laure.
We've been living together for one year. 
 - One year and half! 
 - One year and half?
So you're going to get married? 
 - Yes...
So first you stopped your studies to become a joke 
 and now you're going to marry a White!
But Dad.... 
 - And cut your hair! I can't see them!
It's highlighting the room!
Eugénie darling! Give me!
Awe! They are so cute!
Thank you. Who drew this?
They look like Aunt Geneviève. How funny...
Yes darling! Like Aunt Geneviève.
No Rudy, this is not a camel. It's a goat.
Hey kids! it's nice right? It's called a Nativity Scene.
Here this is the donkey. Hee Haw..
Here is the cow. Moooo...
And here...
It's Jesus. He's God's son!
See you later.
Your Grandma made Jesus more important than he actually is... 
 He's just a prophet.
Uncle Davis's right. He's just a prophet!
I don't feel it. 
 Claude! You promised me!
As you're here, in this home where our daughters grew up 
 I want to apologize.
I'm deeply sorry if my words hurt you last time. 
 Even if I didn't mean to be mean...
No problem! This is an old story. 
 Ah thank you! It's a relief!
Because as a Gaullist I was really sad 
 that you could think I was racist!
Sorry Claude, I didn't control my words... 
 Everybody has a hidden racist side...
I want you to know that we have nothing against Jews, 
 Arabs or Chinese.
Because you're French like us! 
 - Absolutely!
Well honestly at first, 
 you weren't the dream sons-in-law!
I hope I didn't hurt you.... 
 - No, no...
It would be the same for my Dad if all 
 of my sisters were married with men from Auvergne!
Personally my Mom had a hard time accepting Odile! 
- Indeed....
Not my parents! They were so happy! 
 Except when I told them she was an artist....
The most important is to make our daughters happy. 
 If they're happy we'll be happy too!
The 3 of you are welcome in the Verneuil family.
Thanks. 
 Let's make a toast for the family! 
 To the family!
What's wrong darling? 
 - Sorry but... it's snowing...
Yes so what? 
 - It's the magic of Christmas!
Yes...
To the magic of Christmas! 
 - To the magic of Christmas!
How was I? 
 - You were perfect!
Sure it was not too much? 
 - No, it was good.
Three turkeys? Isn't it too much? 
 - Well there are 9 of us.
It's a gift for my sons in law! 
 This one is Kosher, this one Halal,
this one is Laqué (roasted) by a Chinese cook.
It's so nice, but I don't eat exclusively Halal.
Neither do I, I don't eat exclusively Kosher! 
 - And I don't eat Laqué exclusively....
Marie it's delicious!  
 This roasted turkey could be a success in China!
Thanks.
David, can I try your Kosher turkey please? 
 Sure...
It's good. Want to try some Halal turkey?
No! Of course not!
Ah ah! I was joking. Let me try it!
Ah ah! Very funny David! 
 Marie and I love the Jewish sense of humor!
We both are fan of Louis De Funès. 
 - Louis De Funès wasn't Jew...
Of course he was! In his Rabbi Jacob role!
Yes, right, right...
What about the Chinese sense of humor Chao? How's it? 
 - It doesn't exist...
How so? 
 - It doesn't exist, Chinese don't laugh.
It was a joke Claude!
This is a local drink and I can tell you, 
 this is not Kosher!
When shall we open the gifts? Tonight or tomorrow? 
 - Tomorrow as usual!
Tonight is the Midnight Mass! 
 - Of course... the Mass, impossible to miss it!
Don't make fun of me...
How are they doing? 
 - Very good, thanks to  alcohol !
You know Mom I was skeptical at first. But it's a great idea to be together! 
 - Really? Do you like it?
Yes! It's so nice!
Oh... You have some concerns. 
 - No, no...
Not at all ! I'm good !
I'm suffocating!
Each time I watch a football game of France, 
 when I hear the Marseillaise anthem I have chills!
Really? 
 - Me too, I have goosebumps!
Same for me! Even if I hate football ! 
 - Are you kidding me?
Do you know La Marseillaise lyrics? 
 Because generally players of foreign descent....
"Allons enfants de la patrie..."
".. le jour de gloire est arrivé!
"Contre nous de la tyrannie"
"L'étendard sanglant est levé"
"L'étendard sanglant est levé!"
"Entendez-vous dans vos campagnes"
"Mugir ces féroces soldats?"
"Qui viennent jusque dans vos bras"
"Egorger vos fils vos compagnes!"
"Aux armes citoyens!"
"Formez vos bataillons!"
"Marchons marchons"
"Qu'un sang impur"
"Abreuve nos sillons!"
I had goosebumps.
You know David if you want you can come to my bank
so I can look at your vintage phone project...
No, I gave up! I've been looking for investors for 3 years now... 
 This project was a real shit!
I'm on something else now! Something great:
Organic Kosher! 
 - Why does the snowman have slanted eyes? It's not Buddha!
Does he have slanted eyes?
Yes they are... A Chinese snowman it doesn't exist! 
 - If you do this...
I give him a kippa!
So I'll give him a beard!
Snow ball fight ? 
 - Seriously?
With an Arab? Aren't you scared?
No guys it's cold... 
 - Let's go!
Come! Come! 
 - Him first!
Come! Come!
Allah Akbar!
It's fine Rachid! It reminds him his youth! Right Claude? 
 - Yes it's really fun...
Chao we're going to the Mass. 
 - Ok I'm coming!
Don't worry it's nothing. 
 Are you going to the church?
Of course! I'm open minded! 
 - What a Chinese!
First class kiss ass !
Look who's coming! 
 United Color of Benetton family!
I'm so glad all of you came. 
 - Well it's so important for you Catholics!
We're so glad to share it with all the family. 
 - Exactly and our religions are cousins !
Exactly Rachid! 
 - and they call me kiss ass....
Claude! Claude!
Oh hey Jean-Jérôme! 
 Hey Clotilde!
"Jean-Jérôme" pffff... 
 - Can we meet your sons in law ?
We weren't invited to their weddings... 
 - Later Jean-Jé !
We need to find a place quickly. Go go go!
Charles be careful with White people especially the Frenchmen!
Frenchmen are bad and stupid.
I know what I'm talking about!  
 When I was in the French Army...
... I was oppressed all the time!
If I wasn't Black I would be a General now !
Stop this! It's not White people! 
 It's your bad temper!
Yellow Black Red ! 
 You were never able to communicate with your superiors! 
Faster! We're going to miss the Mass!
Do you know that in France they have a dessert 
 called  Tête de Nègre ! (Negro Face)
No Dad this name doesn't exist anymore! 
 It was banned !
I'm pretty sure it still exists! 
 They love it !
I know a cake called "Le congolais" (the Congolese) 
 Leave us alone with your cakes !
"Through long ages of the past
Now the time has come at last!"
"He is born the holy Child"
"Sing we all of the Savior mild."
"O how lovely O how pure"
"Is this perfect Child of heaven"
"O how lovely O how pure"
"Gracious gift to humankind!"
I'm really happy because a divided family 
 would be too sad!
Don't worry darling Mom is all right.
Who can it be? 
 - No idea.
Can you get the door Laure please? 
 - Yes.
Xavier Dupuy-Jambard? 
 - Merry Christmas Laure!
What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in Washington? 
 - No I came back for Christmas.
Claude! Look who's here!
Oh Xavier! What a good news!
He's so ugly ! 
 - Xavier you look so fresh !
This is the fresh air of America! 
 Did you know Xavier worked in a bank in Washington?
For a pension.. 
 - Better than a bank! People like you are leading the world!
Come in! Green or Black tea? 
 - Black.
Very nice to visit us!
So Laure what are you doing for a living? 
 - I work for LCI News.
Not surprised ! 
 - Why?
Because all the LCI's reporters are gorgeous.
I work for the legal service. 
 - Ah...
Who are these people there? 
 - What people?
Are they your gardeners?
How did you make them work on December 25th?
Actually those are our sons in law. 
 - Ah...
I'm sorry ! It's stupid I thought they...
So you work in the legal service? 
 - Yes, I just told you that...
I've heard...
I can't see it! 
 - Look again!
I can see your name now! Charles Koffi! 
 My big brother!
Oh what did you think? I play Pontagnac! The first role! 
 - I hope you won't play the turkey role!
Don't make us look bad!
Charles your Dad wants to talk to you. 
 - Why? I did nothing wrong...
I had a meeting with your Mom and she 
 agreed with me as usual!
Charles we accept the wedding ! 
 - Thanks Dad...
But there are 3 conditions! 
 First...
the wedding will happen in France early July. 
 - Why early July?
Because we've already planned to go to France at this time. 
 I've already payed the plane tickets!
I'll come too ! 
 -You... Shut your mouth !
Second! They pay for the wedding !
Indeed! The White man looted Africa! 
 He has to give back!
Third, if I hear some racist comments about Blacks!
I'll hit them!
You'll hit them? 
 - Exactly! I'll hit them!
Wait, you're not going to hit anyone! 
 Her parents are very tolerant, it will be fine!
Their other sisters married each of them a Chinese, 
 a Jew and an Arab.
What kind of family is that? 
 Are they Communists?
They're nice actually. 
 - Yes but I woudn't spend my vacations with them...
Well we're probably going to spend all our holidays with them. 
- Indeed...
What are you doing here? You'll miss your train.. 
 - I need to talk to you!
I'm going to get married! 
 - Already?
Why "already"? 
 - I knew it! Xavier and you!
No it's not Xavier! Forget Xavier now!
What's the lucky man's name? 
 - Charles... 
 - Like Charles de Gaulle?
Well, yes... 
 - Catholic please..
Sorry? 
 - Is he Catholic? 
 - Yes he is!
Are you going to get married in the church? 
 - Probably... his family is very religious.
But I need to warn you about something...
Well he's ... he's...
Yes? 
 - He's a comedian!
It's totally fine! We don't care!
Exactly! A job is a job.
Can I kiss you? 
 - Sure Mom!
We'll make it early July! It's our wedding's date.
Great date! 
 - I need to reserve the church now! There are many weddings in July!
Hold on... You didn't even meet him! 
 - Oh right, we need to meet him!
When are we going to meet your Charles? 
 - Soon...
He's on a tour for his show in a foreign country. 
 When he'll be back, we'll meet!
That's great! We're so glad. Let's celebrate! 
 Oh Charles!
"No problem with my parents. 
 We'll get married in July."
"Great date. I love you."
One out of four. We can consider ourself lucky!
You're right! Even if our in-laws are nice, 
 it's such a relief!
I knew it! I knew that my little Laure wouldn't 
 disappoint us.
She was always different. 
 She's strong!
but also fragile and intelligent. 
 She understands people!
Yes that's right. 
 - Ah my little daughter!
It's this place. 
 How's my tie? Anything in my nose?
No you're perfect love. 
 - Thanks. 
 - My parents will love you!
10 minutes late. 
 At least he's not Chinese !
Thank God!
Table on the left...
Who's this? The valet?
No he's not the valet. It's him, it's Charles!
Did you tell them I was Black? They look surprised...
No I didn't. I forgot... 
 - You don't forget this kind of thing! 
 Look at your Dad! He's going to have a heart attack!
Hello Papa! hello Maman! This is Charles!
You could have told me your parents were White!
It was a joke! 
 - Ha of course! You're a comedian...
...a funny comedian! 
 - Definitively we attract jokes...
Our 3 other son-in-laws like jokes too. 
 - Nice! We're going to like each other!
Do you know them? 
 - No but Laure told me. It's extraordinary what's happening to your family!
Yes... 
 - With you we have all the rainbow's colors!
Luckily you don't have a 5th daughter! 
 - Why? 
 - Because she would have married a Gypsy!
A Gypsy Hehe!
I like it! It's very funny! 
 - Very good joke!
Except for his hair, he's nice. 
 - Yes and well educated.
He has a good sense of humor. 
 - Yes and he's handsome!
Exactly! He's elegant... tall... athletic...
Laure is very beautiful too.
We'll have great mixed grand children.
This wedding is too much! I can't do it!
What did we do to God, Claude? 
 - I don't know!
I'm lost darling! I'm in the Schwartz, in the dark!
We're in the black, totally...
Claude what are you doing?
Well it's obvious! I'm cutting some wood!  
 - So early? 
 - So what? I need to relax!
We didn't educate them well that's it! 
 - It's your fault! Let them study in Paris!
Remember I was against it! 
 - So this is my fault?
Well sometimes you were a little bit lax with them.
What? Oh yes I was less strict than you with religion! 
 "Love each other"... Look the consequences!
I'm going to cut the long branches! 
 - Go cut them!
Exactly what I said! Bad education!
Hop! Back home.
Are you all right? 
 - Yes! Leave me alone!
Are you sure? 
 - Stop monitoring me all day!
Oh my God Ségolène! 
 - It's not a big lost!
Excuse me Darling but it hurts so badly!
African weddings are big. You know when it starts 
 not when it stops...
This one will be too much for my parents.
Lucie! Don't hit your sister's head with a rake!
They're use to mixed wedding though. 
 - Yes but the repetitiveness of it may be too much for them!
As they say in Africa "One more chop  
 the tree will fall!"
Here she comes.
Did you want to see me? 
 - You're so secretive ! You're getting married?
Why are we the last to know? 
 - I was going to tell you... I was busy!
Wait.. why do you look so sad? 
 What's your problem? The fact he's Black?
Laure C'mon! Don't play the racist card! Not with us!
Mom is deeply depressed! You're going to kill her!
Am I dreaming? You were secretive too! 
 Why should I give up?
We're just asking you to think twice before getting married.
You're their last hope to get the perfect son-in-law... 
 According to their standards...
Really? At least mine is Catholic!
He wants to cut all our trees!
He said they made him anxious. 
 - Trees made him anxious?
Isabelle, talk to him! I already tried! 
 I'm going to sleep...
Mom! It's only 5:00 pm! 
 - Already.... it's fast.
With a chain saw! 
 -He's cutting everything like in the Amazon Forest!
Mom is still in bed? 
 - Still... she doesn't even go to the church.
This is really serious! 
 The only time she missed a Mass it was when I was born!
She refused to take care of Benjamin for 
 our trip for Venice!
Well let's be honest. This Black is a 
 threat for our family !
True...  
 - Just when we finally found an harmony between us!
It makes me think of the movie "Saving Private Ryan". 
 3 brothers dead on the battlefield,
the army saves the 4th to bring him back in his family.
Here you have 3 Frenchwomen, pure French, 
 married with immigrants' sons,
You've to stop the 4th to do the same thing. 
 - Did you just compare our marriage with a war?
It was just an image... 3 Metics (immigrants) 
 and now a Black, for your parents it's Fukushima!
"Sweet France 
 Dear country of my childhood"
"Cradled in tender carefreeness
I have kept you in my heart!"
"My village
with the bell tower and with noble houses"
Yesterday I had a dream probably related with my problems
I'm listening...
I walked with a Black child in a stroller  and...
I was ashamed ! 
 - What else?
I wasn't ashamed of my Black grandchild. I was ashamed people 
 could think I was Gabon's embassy's nanny!
Do you think I'm racist? 
 - And you, what do you think?
I've an idea! 
 We need to trap Charles !
He must have a weakness!
I do know my Black cousins they're sex addicts! 
 Women are their Achilles' heel!
What a cliché! Not all Black men are sex addicts! 
 - Go in a Caribbean Club and you'll see by yourself!
First he's not Caribbean he's African. 
 It's totally different !
Let's first check if it's not a fake marriage. 
 Africans do a lot of fake marriages to get citizenship!
Because the Chinese don't? 
 - Yes they do.... but he's Black, not Yellow...
Luckily! I don't want a 2nd Chinese in the family!
Same for me! I don't want a 2nd Arab in the family! 
 Especially a Moroccan!
I understand, if he was Ashkenazi ...
... I would kill him!
"Sir enough! Get out! 
 - No Madame I love you!"
"I had a crush on you the first time I saw you!"
"I followed you for 8 days didn't you notice? 
 - No .."
- Lie! A woman always notice these kind of things! 
 -What an emptiness! "
So weird to see a Black in a Feydeau theater.
It's modern.
Why a Black would be modern? 
 - I don't really know... I was 5 years old the last time I was in a theater!
Look at the Chinese!
Fucking kids! 
 - Hush!
Rachid calm down! 
 - Sorry...
Forget it !
Watch! I'm sure he fucks with the ginger girl!
"Love first!"
Look how close they are! 
 - They're just comedians, they play ! 
 - It's more than a play, look !
"Do you swear to keep your words" 
 - "Yes"
 "Oh joy!"
I need to take a shit!
What is he doing? It's been one hour! 
 - He's having sex with the ginger !
I'm proud of you! You played very well. 
 Charles Koffi !
The ginger girl wasn't enough! He needs more! 
 These Black dudes are Sex Machines for real!
Follow me! We've trapped the cousin!
I love Paris so much it's so beautiful! 
 - Oh so beautiful!
Haters gonna hate! Ha Ha! 
 - You speak too much Viviane! Let's go to bed!
He's totally trapped now! Take pictures!
I'm sorry for you Laurette. I know it's not easy to admit!
I warned you about Black guys! 
 - You're totally crazy! It's his sister!
This is his sister? 
 - Yes, his sister Vivianne, she's in Paris for one week!
Ha ha! Sorry... 
 - It's not funny.
His sister!
 Mom and Dad are becoming like zombies and 
 you want to breakup my couple!
I'm going to crack!
I'm cracking now!
Sorry we'll help you to make the best wedding of 
 the Verneuil family!
This morning, walking on the Loire River side I saw a 
 small field mouse. 
 - Continue...
As a child I use to hate field mice. They're cute and inoffensive though... 
 - Continue....
My fear of the Other, of the Unknown may come from 
 my irrational fear of field mice!
The field mice becoming the foreign people! 
 Is it possible?
What do you think about it?
Field mice? 
 - Indeed...
So your racism comes from the field mice fear? 
 - Not racism! Fear of the Unknown!
So different... 
 - This shrink is great!
He doesn't talk a lot and I progress so much!
Indeed.. You call our sons-in-laws rats and you think feeling better!  
 - Not rats! Field mice, it's more cute!
It's still a kind of rat! Stop all this nonsense !
Stop spitting on these photos!
Hey I read you Bio Mitzvah Project. I like it! 
 - Really?
It could work? 
 - Yes but 600,000 Jews, this market is too small.
You should make some Organic Halal ! 
 - Are you crazy? I can't do it my Mom will kill me!
5 Million Muslims in France, think about it !
Ah! This is the lover!
Hello!
The paparazzi! 
 - Hello 
 - Hello Charles... 
 - Happy Sunday!
So you don't want any Blacks in the family?
Give me this for the fridge. 
 - I come with you...
You know the family situation. It's not about racism... 
 - Yes a little bit I think !
Give up Rachid... we're not excusable. 
 - Sorry Charles, we're real assholes....
It's ok I understand. You don't want to share 
 the pie with your brother of color!
No C'mon!
Are we the pie? 
 - No sweetheart, it was an image...
So who's who? Let me guess.... 
 Easy! You're Chao 
 - Yes!
Look this face ha!
Now it's harder !
Nothing resembles anything more than 2 Semitics!
Hummm David and Rachid! 
 - You're right!
Welcome in the family man! 
 - Thanks.
Are you going to fish again? 
 - Yes. 
 - Charles and Laure are waiting for us!
Do it without me! Am I really necessary?
Claude it's important for your daughter and for us!
What's wrong with you? Are you happy with this marriage? 
 - Yes!
It's 2013! World has changed; you need to be tolerant! 
 Open to other people !
You're scary Marie! Really scary!
Ah! Your parents! 
 - Wait! I need to tell you something...
I kinda exaggerated the tolerant side of Africa, you know 
 "open door", "colorblind"... 
 - What do you mean?
My Dad is like yours! But in a Black version! 
 Let's go!
Hello! 
 - Hello Madame, hello Monsieur.
Hey Laure! What's up? 
 - What's up Vivianne?
You go back there!
Where are your parents? The meeting was 
 planned for 18h00
Ah! They're here! 
 Sit down please.
Hello! We're delighted to finally meet you Mr and Ms Koffi
We're delighted too! Right André?
What about the wedding menu? 
 Do you agree with a traditional meal?
What do you mean by traditional? 
 - French traditional! We're in France!
Why not an African traditional meal? 
 - Sorry?
Let's do a mixed meal! African appetizer and French main course! 
 - Mixed like our couple!
Ok but I want an African main course because 
 they isn't enough food in White's cuisine!
Well you probably don't know the Cassoulet Sir! 
 - I know Cassoulet very well !
And I insist! It's not enough food for me!
No offense Claude... but we eat so much 
 in African weddings!
And you'll need to feed all our cousins!
What cousins? How many of them?
The ones from France, the ones from Abidjan... 
 the Traoré from Germany, the Coulibaly from Italy 
 about 400 people!
Dad we don't need to invite all of them! 
 - Are you ashamed of your family?
No but I don't even know the Traoré ! 
 - Who are these Coulibaly ?
You... shut your mouth!
For us, Monsieur, family is important! 
 - It's important for us too, what do you think?
It will be hard to welcome 400 people and there are 
 few hotels around...
My son told me you have a big home right? 
 - Do you think it's a castle? Like the Chateau de Chambord?
It's not possible! 
 - Except if we put tents in our yard.
Why not some African huts! 
 - Dad please...
For Rachid's wedding we put some tents in the yard. 
 It was a lot of people and it was great!
Rachid? Those people are Bedouin! They are use to it! 
 Here in Abidjan we live in permanent houses!
What about budget and finance? 
 - We'll see to that later!
No! I want to see to it now! 
 - What? You don't trust us?
Enough Dad... Let's talk about something else! 
 - Good idea! What about music and dance?
I hope you like Coupé-Décalé ! 
 - Unfortunately I don't know what is it....
Coupé Décalé! 
 Coupé 
 Décalé 
 ...
What is he doing? 
 - It's his own dance I guess....
Great...
Idi Amin Dada comes with 400 guests and he doesn't 
 want to pay anything? 
 - He said we'll see to that later.
Later? I know this scam...
How's he going to pay? With CFA Franc?
I warn you! No negotiation on finances! 
 It's a question of principles!
Where are you going? 
 - To sleep in the sofa, I had enough with your racist comments!
Go play with your field mice old crazy woman! 
 - I've heard you! Fascist!
Catholic leftist!
I didn't like how patronizing was this White man!
Did you see how suspicious he was when we talked about money?
Listen! If you break this marriage 
 I'll do the strike! (Sex boycott)
The strike?... 
 - The strike!
I know my Dad, he'll try to destroy this wedding. 
 - Mine too...
We should have made the Civil Union only...
What about a white rose alley with colored hoops?
Do whatever you want Gérald. I want this wedding 
 to be the best day of her life! 
 - It will be!
What's going on Josianne? 
 - I prepare your room for the guests.
What are you doing with our room? 
 - The Koffi would have done the same for us in Africa!
My bed my daughter what's next? My credit card?
God! He's wearing a boubou! 
 - So what?
He usually wears a Western suit. He just wants to provoke your Dad! 
 - No relax...
Air France! Never again! 
 - What a monster! 
 - He didn't even say hello!
What happened to him? 
 - He made a scandal in the plane!
They refused to upgrade him. 
 - He had a Business Class ticket? 
 - No! They upgraded him by mistake one day, so now he wants it every time !
Your Dad is awful!
How did you spend 35 years with him Mom?
So beautiful! Come kiss me my daughter!
If I hear a racist comment I'll hit him!
Papa be cool please! 
 - I'm not Uncle Ben!
A little appetizer before dinner. 
 - Thanks Ms Verneuil. 
 - Madeleine, call me Marie!
Our bedroom is ready for you. It's the best one. 
 - So nice! 
 - We're the same family!
Well Not yet!
I hope your room is not too humid. 
 Humidity makes me sick!
Oh yes! It's very humid! It's almost moldy! But you 
 can find an hotel in the south, weather is drier there...
About the banquet, our cook can make a French appetizer 
 and an Ivoirian main course!
Great! We'll eat Attiéké poisson braisé with Gnamakoudji juice! 
 - What?...
Gnamakoudji juice...
Finally we'll be fewer than expected...
How many? 
 - About 10 ...
They all cancelled their trip. 
 - But we already gave a deposit....
Didn't you take a cancellation insurance? 
 - Certainly not !
You should have... African people are unpredictable.
Do you like it? 
 - Yes but it's small...
I would like this Bible text for the Mass. To read together.
It's my favorite part!
Hello Mrs. Verneuil! 
 - Hello Father! 
 - Already here? 
 - Yes, we're busy...
I'm under pressure: the first religious wedding of a Verneuil daughter!
You look radiant it's nice! 
 - Thanks.
This is Mrs. Koffi. 
 - Hello Ms Koffi! 
 - Hello Father, I'm Charles' Mother.
Charles? 
 - The groom. 
 - The groom?
Laure's groom? 
 - Yes.
Why is he laughing like this? 
 - What's happening? 
 - Nothing, sorry.
I'll be right back.
He's always happy...
I'm killing you! 9-2 ! 
 - My racquet sucks! 
 - We've the same racquet!
Rachid? Can I ask you something? 
 - Later, we're playing!
Calm down man! It's not the Olympic Games...
I want to start a business in the Halal market. 
 - Halal? You?
With Chao's bank help. 
 But upscale Halal! "High level" !
100% organic! 
 - Its name: "The OrgArab" !
OrgArab? 
 - Organic + Arab = OrgArab! I found the name by myself!
This name is so messed up!
I told you it was messed up! 
 - Do you think so too? 
 - I couldn't imagine more messed up!
The idea is good though but...
a Jew and a Chinese trying to steal the Muslim's business...
It can be dangerous for you guys! 
 You'll need a good laywer... Arab laywer!
Shall we hire him? 
 - Yes!
Thanks guys! I hate being a lawyer in Bobigny!
Well... Poor France!
We met each other in a court of law. She pleaded 
 against me and she won...
I lost my trial but I won my wife!
What about you Chao? 
 - Well... randomly,
... in my office. 
 - I was always in the red and he was very comprehensive with me!
Do you have sex with your clients?
No I marry them!
What about you two? 
 - In the theater....
Enough for me! I'm going to sleep.
Communists!
I'm leaving too! 
 - Dad please...
You don't sleep? 
 - No I can't stop thinking about Bokassa sleeping in my bed!
Just ask! No need to be violent!
Why did you give them our bedroom?
"Thursday July 3th. 
 2 days before the marriage"
Mom where is my self-portrait?  
 Did you sell it?
No...  
 But you're right... where's this nice painting?
You should ask your Dad where's the painting.
I'm sure you sold it!
I feel dizzy... I'm hot...
Odile! Isabelle! Come take care of your sister!  
 My class is starting...
They sold it!
There are 3 butchers in the area.
Papa why did you sell the Ségolène's painting?
One moment please...  
 - She's mad now.
Use your brain! Who would buy an ugly painting like this?  
 It fell when I moved it to the attic!
It was always in the attic except when Ségolène came to visit.  
 - That's smart!
Well sorry, these people are visiting.  
 Roof and plumbing were renovated in 2007.
Papa! what's happening?  
 - Please, continue the visit without me..
Are you selling the home?  
 - Yes! But don't worry your Mom will get her part of the money.
I'm going to travel around the world!
It's now or I'll get too old! What's wrong?  
 You gave me this idea actually!
I want some exoticism too !  
 With some luck I'll find a sexy wife.
Tahitian.. Papuan.. Eskimo!  
 Everything's possible in our family!
Are you going to leave Mom?  
 - Yes but she'll adapt!
We don't have the same values anyway.
Listen! Difference of values... Zumba!  
 - Mom likes Zumba?
Indeed she likes Zumba...
Come!  
 - Zumba all day! It's breaking my ears!
My shrink asked me to practice some sports!
I love Zumba!  
 - Me too!
Did you know Dad was selling the home  
 to do a trip around the world?
Good riddance!
The 2 grumblers shouldn't be together...
 - Certainly not!
Are you ok Ségolène?  
 - Yes I'm good...
They all want coffee?  
 - Yes and tea for Mom and Madeleine.
What a dinner!  
 - It was terrible, I'm so sad.
We need to talk with Laure and Ségolène.  
 - No, Ségo is not ready and Laure will feel guilty.
No Laure is strong! It's not her fault if our  
 parents are divorcing!
Not tonight! I don't want...
What a beginning... Not even married and we stop having sex!  
 - It's not funny!
Good night.
Good night.
"Friday July 4th. One day before wedding"
I've had a good Jewish friend!  
 - Really?
His name was Levy! A dentist.  
 He made all my teeth crowns.
Look the quality!  
 - Wow... It's nice...
Mr Verneuil!  
 - What?  
 - I want to talk face to face.
I can't Mr Koffi. I've an appointment...  
 - It's important!
Ok, I listen...  
 - I said, face to face...
Shit!
We're going to get closer to each other in the future.
I want to make things clear Mr Verneuil !
I disapprove of the marriage!  
 - What a surprise!
I'm not racist! But I want my son to marry a Black woman! 
An African! An Ivoirian!
I'm not racist either but I want my daughter to marry  
 a White, European and French man!
Really? Do you disapprove of this marriage too?  
 - Of course I disapprove!
I thought you were a Communist !  
 - What? A communist! I'm a Gaullist!
Awwww I'm Gaullist too!  
 Except his African policies... What a disaster!
Humm.. African leaders took advantage of the  
 situation pretty well!
Funny! Why is it always White men's fault ?
Because, Sir, you looted Africa and you are still looting today!  
We've nothing left! Not even the cocoa!  
 - Yes, yes... What about the wedding?
You were supposed to pay half of it.  
 Where's my money?
So little! We were talking geopolitics and important things!
I'm tired of your damned financial concerns!  
 - What? I'm tired of you too!
Because of you I slept in the attic!  
 - Be careful! Watch your tone!
Otherwise....  
 - Otherwise what?
Help me!
It's a Northern Pike!
It's a beast! A beast!
He's getting tired!
Wow! Kate Middleton should take an example from you!
Are you ok?  
 - Sure... Our parents are divorcing because of me!
Ségo it's not your fault!  
 - We're all responsible!
She's having a sad moment...  
 - It was the same for my wedding Darling!
Sad to leave parent's home right?
What's wrong Ségolène?
Oh... It's just your normal mood!  
 I'm busy I need to go!
Did you see your Dad by the way?  
 - No...
Nice catch!
It's heavy!
Argh! I thought he was dead!
I didn't hit him hard enough!
Are you going to be all right?  
 - I was in the Marines! A little French fish won't put me down!
So what were we talking about?  
 - The marriage...
I disapprove ! Disapprove totally !
What shall we do Mr. Koffi? Priest kidnapping?  
 - I've actually thought about it!
Me too...
So? Not enough food in White people's meal?  
 - Mmmm! Very good... for an appetizer!
Another one!
Madeleine did you see my husband?  
 - No, I'm looking for mine too.
They're fishing.  
 - Fishing? But there is a lot of work to do!
Ah men... Men are lazy!
We shall call them.  
 - Don't worry!  
 - I don't feel it...
You know what? Diversity doesn't work!  
 It's scientifically proven!
Scientifically?  
 - Demonstration:
Oil ... Water...
I'm mixing it...
You see it doesn't mix! This is the proof!
Nice demonstration...
What about Chapacino?  
 - What?  
 - I mean Cappuccino!
Milk and coffee can mix very well!
It's true.  
 My demonstration was stupid.
Let me pay another Calvados !
Hell no! It's my wife!
Mine too!  Damn..
Hey! One more Calvados!
Mail box... 
 - We're going to find them. Where does he fish ?
In this little pond where I taught you swimming.
We're having a good time! 
 Why don't they leave us alone!
One Calvados bottle!
Are you sure it's here? 
 - Of course! I spend all my childhood here!
Oh relax!
Bye, thank you.
Gérard! It fits very well! Ha ha! 
 - Take the menu for your wife.
You're going to marry an Ivoirian lady now! 
 Yes... sure...
André do you want a dessert? 
 -Yes, I know which one!
Hello Monsieur! I would like a Tête de Nègre! (Negro Face) 
 - Excuse me?
One Tête de nègre! Are you deaf ?
Koffi! Is it what you're looking for?
René! Call the police these 2 crazy guys want to make trouble!
Yes! I recognize it! It's a Tête de Nègre! 
 - It's full of Tête de Nègre!
No Sir! It's the same recipe but we call it 
 Chocolate Meringue now.
Chocolate Meringue?...
I know you changed the name because I'm here! 
 I know you still call it Tête de Nègre with your clients! 
 - Not at all!
Let's check it then! Ok Claude? 
 - We've all day!
Tête de nègre! 
 - No, Chocolate Meringue. "Choco Face" eventually...
Choco Face....
Dad's handkerchief! 
 - Are you sure? 
 - Yes! Look there are his name initials!
I hope my Dad didn't beat him. 
- What? Do you  think he could beat him?
He's a savage! 
 - Savage? Watch your tongue!
Don't play the susceptible guy please! 
 -I wouldn't be surprised if your Dad made a racist comment!
Name initials on a handkerchief! 
 That's really a White man thing!
Leave me alone!
You're making a mistake I'm a notary!
I'm working with Creuset notary studies! 
 - Never heard about it!
You'll regret it!  
 Watch out! My boubou!
I found Dad's handkerchief!  
 - What happened?
Give me this Marie! I'm a lawyer!
It seems to be blood. 
 I'll call local hospitals and police stations!
... and morgues! 
 - Not yet Ségolène...
André, do you have a lot of immigrants in 
 Côte d'Ivoire ?
Too much! There are Lebanese, Arabs, Chinese...
At least you don't have any Black immigrants!
Excellent!
Why are you laughing? 
 - His joke was awesome!
Relax André! You laugh too.
You can laugh at everything but not with everyone! 
 - Don't point the finger at me!
Watch your tone Albino! 
 - Get back Kirikou !
André!
Claude...
Exactly... Indeed... Thanks a lot. Bye.
They found them!
They're at Chinon's jail. 
 - For what reason?
Public drunkenness! Insulting public servant! 
 - What!
It can be serious... 
 - Mom! We're going to be deported from France!
Our wedding ceremony is screwed up! 
 They got what they wanted!
Let me talk ok?
I'm sorry Claude. 
 It's the fault of this idiot Albino!
I'm not a fucking Albino! My Dad's blond!
Seriously Claude isn't he albino? 
 - I don't give a shit! My nose is broken!
Finally! They're coming for us! 
 My son-in-law is a lawyer!
I don't understand ...
Who are you for Mr Verneuil? 
 - His son-in-law!
What about you? 
 - His son in law.
His son-in-law too I guess... 
 - Yes officer.
If you say you're his son-in-law I'll blow a fuse! 
 - Almost...
Almost? 
 - I'm Mr. Koffi's son.
Tomorrow I'll marry Mr Verneuil's daughter. 
 So I'm almost his son-in-law.
Get out of here! 
 Get the fuck out !
I never said he was as good as Robert Badinter! (famous lawyer)
Everything's fine. Hopefully they'll be freed just before the wedding ceremony! 
 - Hopefully?
Hopefully...
What are you doing?
I'm going back to Paris.
I want to cancel everything. It cannot work! 
 - Are you kidding me?
Is it because we had an argument earlier? 
 - Not at all! 
 - So what?
Our families can't be friends! 
 -We love each other, it's what matters!
We'll suffer of this situation in the future!
Charles my parents want to divorce!
It's going too far! 
 - Could you tell to our future child that their grandparents divorced because of us?
No I couldn't...
Don't be mad at me! I'm sorry.
"Saturday July 5th. Wedding day"
Let's do some fish quenelles! It's delicious!
You're so welcoming... What's wrong? Someone's dead? 
 - We need to talk! 
 - We need to talk!
Give us a break! We're hungry! 
 - Shut your mouth!
Listen guys! You have to bring back Laure and Charles 
 for 11am in the church!
Otherwise don't even come back here!
Right Madeleine? 
 - Exactly!
What happened?
Where's my daughter? 
 - In the train...
Incapable of keeping a wife! 
 Good-for-nothing !
Laure! How can you be so irrational!
I prefer to cancel the wedding rather than watching both 
 of you fighting in the church !
What're you talking about? We're the best friends of the world! 
 Right André ?
We love each other!
You're always fighting! I found your handkerchief full of blood! 
 - It's nothing!
It was a Blood Pact! Like brothers!
Blood Pact with your nose Dad? 
 It's too late anyway, it's a direct train to Paris!
Oh la la ! Please!
He is having malaise! Stop the train!
He is the Burundi Finance Minister! 
 Hurry up!
Burundi? 
 - It's working!
Don't be worried! She'll come! 
 Beautiful ladies are always late!
Actually I don't know ha! That's what people told me!
As a soldier I'll make a clear and concise speech!
I didn't want him to talk...
Today is a big day for my family.
It's a relief !
My elder son is finally taken! With a gorgeous lady!
To be honest I was starting to be worried!
Especially since he missed his Baccalauréat.. 
 and started a joke of a job !
Son! I'm teasing you! 
 I'm proud of you!
I'm also proud of my French family in law!
Claude! 
 - Thanks André.
Thanks! I'm also very happy for this wedding.
To be honest I'm kind of jealous!
Charles and Laure are young, beautiful and intelligent!
You're going to do a great honeymoon! It's unfair !
So I had an idea... Marie?
Do you want to do another honeymoon with me?
Yes! 
 - Perfect!
We'll go all over the world!
We'll visit Chao's family in Beijing, ...
Rachid's family in Algiers! ...
David's one in Tel-Aviv! 
 And Finally we'll visit Abidjan!
Where I'll collect my money André! 
 - I'll give you a money transfer!
Thanks.
Just married!
