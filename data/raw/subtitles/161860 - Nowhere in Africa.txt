I couldn't really remember
what Germany was like.
I knew they had snow and seasons...
and our family had lived there.
Not only Mama and Papa,
but the whole family.
And it was nice.
But I also remember
that I was always afraid...
of other children and people...
and especially of dogs.
Mommy!
Come here. Let me help you.
NOWHERE IN AFRICA
I remember Germany as a dark place.
Not as bright and hot as Kenya.
A place with large buildings
and dismal rooms.
Papa always says, "Germany is our home."
I think he just misses his father...
my grandfather.
He couldn't eat cookies with nuts,
because he was allergic.
He really liked Heinrich Heine's poems...
especially the ones about Germany.
I had two aunts in Germany
that I liked an awful lot.
Aunt Käthe was Mama's sister.
Papa's sister was Liesl.
Sometimes they helped out in Grandpa's
hotel, the "Adler" in Sohrau.
That was in the good old days
before the Nazis came.
Can I help you?
No, thank you.
We have to go now.
The Nazis forbade Papa to work as a
lawyer and took away Grandpa's hotel.
Soon none of our family had a job.
When I asked my parents why that was so,
I always got the same answer:
"Because we're Jews, Regina. That's why."
What's wrong?
An urgent message!
Walter!
Wake up!
- This is quinine. It's good for you.
- Leave me alone!
Come on! Wake up!
Give me the coffee.
Hurry!
Good heavens, Walter, wake up!
Come on, open your mouth!
- Breslau, January 1938 -
- Jettel, can I have some apple juice?
- Ask Klara, please.
Anna, I'm glad you could come
despite the snow. Come in.
- Good evening, Mrs. Redlich.
- Good evening.
Move it!
Don't talk to Jews!
Stop playing with those matches!
- You're going to burn down the house!
- Sure thing, Klara!
Here, a sausage.
You gotta get used to it!
Negroes always eat it black.
- No, they don't.
- Or raw and bloody!
I know they eat dogs
from my Geography book.
They eat grasshoppers, too. Here, hold him.
You wanna go to Africa?
You're even afraid to touch a dachshund.
Grandpa!
- Are there nuts in it?
- They're the only cookies I could get.
- Oh, Klara.
- There aren't many nuts in them anyway.
- You have to sneeze, right?
- Right.
Every time I eat nuts I have to sneeze.
Every darn time.
I really loved the green one.
Walter bought me this for New Year's,
but it isn't really my style.
I think it's very elegant.
Then take it.
You're such a sweetheart, Jettel. Thanks.
Käthchen, don't cry today, okay?
Do I dare to wear this?
It fits your rear end!
- Mrs. Redlich...
- Men like 'em round.
That's for me!
This is for you, Klara!
Glitter is what you need.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
It's from Africa.
Rongai, Kenya, 2 December 1937.
My beloved Jettel:
I can imagine that this letter
will upset you, so try to be strong.
Last week,
the Jewish community in Nairobi...
agreed to pay for your immigration.
After six months here...
I'll finally be able
to organize the trip for you and Regina.
I beg you not to wait another day.
Go see Karl Silbermann at once.
He can help you
with the tickets for the ship.
It doesn't matter
what kind of ship or how long it takes.
Just so it takes you.
What we need here is a refrigerator.
If it doesn't fit in our chests,
then throw out the Rosenthal china.
It's useless here.
Also, get kerosene lamps, mosquito nets...
and sturdy shoes for you and Regina.
Don't try to bring any cash
or jewelry with you.
You know what Nazis do to smugglers.
And say as little as possible.
There's no one you can trust...
not even people we called our best friends.
Oh, Jettel, my heart wants to burst
at the thought of embracing you two.
But it grows heavy imagining how much
this letter will hurt your mother.
Walter, you've got malaria.
You have to take this quinine.
It's very important.
I have to get back to the farm.
Owuor will take care of you.
He needs the quinine 3 times a day.
3 times 40 drops.
Understand?
I understand.
Max, we have to go!
I hate having to say goodbye.
I can't stand train stations either.
This will all be over in one or two years.
So you two are sticking together?
Promise me that you'll stick it out together.
One person always loves more.
That's what makes it so difficult.
And the one who loves more is vulnerable.
My son loves you...
very much.
I'm going to miss you so much, Max.
Mama!
Tell her goodbye, please.
Eat this.
It will take the fire out of your body.
Very good!
- Ever heard of the "Silesian Heaven?"
- "Silesian?"
Meat, potatoes,
bacon and dried fruit all mixed together.
I don't understand a word!
In my first life I was a lawyer.
- Kikombe.
- What?
- Kikombe!
Kikombe.
Kiyo la dirisha.
Kiyo la dirisha.
Kiko la ...
Dirisha la Kiyo.
Dirisha la Kiyo...
Asante kapissa!
Owuor, this is for you.
- You're giving me your coat?
- It's a robe.
I was ill, and you looked after me.
I am very grateful to you, Owuor.
I wore the robe in my homeland.
I wasn't a bwana there.
I worked with my head.
And here you don't want
to wear the robe anymore?
You have to be smart to wear a robe.
Here in Rongai you're smart.
Not me.
I'll have to say the word often...
so I can pronounce it just like you do.
Thank you.
We traveled 6 weeks
by steamship around Africa.
On 20 April 1938, the Führer's birthday...
we arrived in Nairobi.
Regina, take this please.
Mrs. Redlich?
Mr. Morrison, who owned the cattle farm
where Papa worked...
picked us up at the train station.
Welcome.
This way.
It reminded me of chocolate
and what Mama told me on the ship.
We were poor now.
"So there's no chocolate for poor kids,"
she said.
And I had promised to be brave.
Hey, come here!
- What did the cow die of?
- We don't have enough water.
Shit! It's always the same!
You have to dig a well!
A well!
There's a car!
Where?
Over there!
Everything's all right now.
My dearest.
Welcome.
Welcome, little memsaab.
Come here.
Welcome to Rongai!
Regina, my girl! Come here!
Papa! We traveled by ship,
and we were in England and Morocco...
and all over the harbor.
I saw dolphins, and Mama danced.
Mr. Redlich?
Can I talk to you?
Water!
The farm needs water.
The cattles need more water!
Water outside.
I told yoy before.
You find water, outside!
Dig a well. A well!
Kisima!
Bwana, he means water.
Understand... a well, a well.
For the workers, you pay him on monday.
Tell the man what to do.
Yes, bwana.
Bloody refugees!
Your father took care of the paperwork,
the refugee tax and everything.
We were lucky. In Hamburg they only
opened one chest full of clothes.
Max gave me "Magic Mountain" for you.
Thank goodness
the books were in the other chest.
I'm sorry, Jettel.
I know this isn't what you were expecting.
It's lovely.
But we can't live here.
Not that one!
Don't unpack the patterned china.
We won't be staying here long.
Memsaab. Sahani, sahani.
Learn German if you want to talk to me.
Plate.
Careful!
Sahani.
Jettel, my name is Süsskind.
Also Walter.
- But everyone calls me Süsskind.
- I see.
Walter is showing Regina the farm.
They'll be back soon.
- Like to have dinner with us?
- Very kind of you. Yes.
I just spent four hours
driving through the desert.
You'll probably have to
put up with me for the night.
I brought you some onions and sugar.
And cigarettes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Blessed Sabbath.
I haven't heard the Kiddush for ages.
Up to now I've never felt I needed God.
If you take quinine every day,
you'll go blind.
What about malaria?
You can always combat it
if you catch it in time.
Here's to the arrival of Jettel and Regina.
To our second life.
Cheers.
How long have you been away from home?
This is my home.
Süsskind was smart enough
to leave Germany in '33.
It was easier to leave back then.
They let you take all your money, right?
- And all your books.
- What about your wife?
Weren't you ever married?
No, I wasn't.
- Why not?
- Jettel!
It was always my bad luck to fall
in love with women who were already taken.
My mother says
someone will have to stop the Nazis.
Germany is rich in culture,
the home of Goethe and Schiller.
Papa, I think I heard some lions.
Nonsense. There aren't any lions around
here. Those are monkeys, baboons.
Maybe the lion is just acting like a monkey.
You have a great future here.
You're already talking like a Negro.
"The air is cool and darkling
"And peaceful flows the Rhine
"The mountain top is sparkling
The setting sunbeams shine
"The fairest maid is reclining
in wondrous beauty there
"Her golden jewels are shining
"She combs her golden hair
"With a golden comb she is combing,
and sings a song so free
"It casts a spell on the gloaming,
a magical melody
"The boatman listens, and o'er him
wild-aching passions roll
"He sees but the maiden before him
He sees not reef or shoal
"I think, at last the wave swallows
the boat and the boatman's cry
"And this is the fate that follows
"The song of the Lorelei"
Sleep tight, my angel.
You didn't bring the fridge, did you?
No, I didn't.
Why not?
There was no room in the chests...
But enough room
for your floral-patterned china?
- There wasn't enough money, anyway.
- What did you do with the money?
If you really want to know...
I bought this at Wertheim's in Breslau.
It cost 45 marks and is beautiful.
You bought an evening gown.
Yes.
... that he gives...
his name to...
... and leaves the mark of his personality...
indelibly on his time...
I never thought I'd be happy
to hear his voice.
I'll leave it here so you can stay in touch
with the outer world.
And you?
- Goodbye.
- We can't accept it.
Of course you can. I have another one.
Anyway, it'll give me a reason
to stop by now and then...
to charge the battery.
Do you have to go now?
In this country we should forget
formalities and use the personal "you."
Don't you think so?
- Do you have a gun in the house?
- Yes, why?
- Since Jettel and Regina are here.
- Morrison left me one.
Good luck with the well.
Come on, little memsaab!
You see that mountain?
That's Mount Kenya.
It's holy.
Mount Kenya.
Come with me, little memsaab.
Mama said I wasn't allowed
to go any further than this ridge.
Can you help me?
- Memsaab?
- Help me!
I'm a cook. Cooks don't dig in the ground.
The ground is thirsty.
You need more water.
Come with me!
No, men don't carry water.
That's women's work.
Help me! It's so heavy!
Owuor, help me, please!
The water is so heavy.
Help us, too!
Please, give me the shovel!
Fire.
Yes, fire.
There's no water in this ground here.
- I told you so.
- You were right, Cepoi.
I'm sorry.
Go home!
And thank you. Thank you very much.
- 6 Months later -
Why doesn't Owuor ever slaughter
a chicken? Nobody would notice.
- Regina, put the doll down.
- We aren't allowed to eat them.
It's our agreement with Morrison.
Only the eggs.
I can't stand this muck anymore!
I need meat!
Thank you, Owuor.
Fire!
You have to look at a fire...
when it has slept for a long time.
Don't worry, Jettel.
It's just a common bushfire.
It won't reach the house.
Where are you going?
- To pack! I'm leaving!
- Nonsense!
- I can't stand it here any longer!
- You have to.
You always say that!
But I want to go home to Mother
and Käthe, to people I understand.
You don't earn a thing.
All we eat are eggs and cornmeal.
How can we ever send Regina to school?
She can't always hang around with Owuor!
- Damn it! We're alive!
- Yes, we're alive!
But what for?
To hope for rain,
so these cows that aren't ours don't die?
My God, I feel like I'm dead,
and sometimes I wish I were!
Don't ever say that again!
We just got out in the nick of time.
What are you talking about?
Last night the Nazis in Germany burned
down synagogues and looted Jewish shops.
They smashed everything to pieces.
People, buildings, stores, everything.
How did you find out
on this goddamn farm?
From a Swiss radio station this morning.
The Nazis no longer see us as humans.
Damn it. I saw it coming.
I saw it from the beginning.
Don't you realize that it doesn't matter
when and if Regina learns to read?
What about Mama, Käthe...
- Your father?
- I have no idea!
I kept telling them they had to leave!
10 November 1938.
Dear Father:
I am very upset about the news
I hear from Germany.
People fear that war is inevitable.
What do you think?
If I only knew how you are doing.
If I earned some money,
I'd have you come here.
Don't you see any opportunity
to leave Germany?
I beg you...
Father...
How I long for a conversation with you...
for your advice, your sympathy.
Being abroad, I have become aware how
blessed I am to have parents like you...
and how grateful I am for everything
you did for me.
Your money wasn't wasted by allowing me
to study so long after mother's death.
One day your son will certainly be
the lawyer you were always so proud of.
Come here, little memsaab.
It needs you. It is a child like you.
- It's so cold!
- Do you want to run around like a Negro?
I don't care.
I don't have anything against Negroes,
and there aren't any other kids here...
but be careful.
They have illnesses like malaria and so on.
They are very dirty,
and I don't want you to get sick.
A white child is not a black child.
And promise you don't eat anything
they give you.
And never enter their huts.
So...
Now swallow this.
It's too bitter.
And anyway, it'll make me go blind.
Nonsense. Open your mouth.
Hey, Mama.
There's a ceremony tonight. They'll
slaughter a lamb and ask Ngai for rain.
- Ask whom?
- Ngai, their god who lives on the mountain...
Mount Kenya, and the fig tree, too.
They're asking him for rain.
It's a big ceremony.
You're not going.
They're asking Ngai for rain.
Could you tell me
why you always repeat everything?
Do the Negroes do that, too?
You can't repeat good things enough.
- Who says?
- Everyone.
- Everyone?
- You can't repeat good things enough.
My God, Regina!
What should I do with you?
- Remember Grandma?
- What?
She always said:
"Don't worry about Regina.
She has the luck of a Gentile."
Exactly...
the luck of a Gentile.
That's what Grandma always said.
So you don't have to worry, Mama.
My angel. I'm so afraid
something might happen to you.
Don't worry. It's nice here.
Toto! Toto!
Memsaab!
Bwana has gone out with the big gun!
Kill it.
I can't do it! You see that I can't!
I just wanted you to have your damn meat!
They don't want anything?
No. They said they're not hungry.
Good night.
I don't mind if you go on reading.
I've read this book 3 times!
Who cares if I read it a fourth time!
Regina.
I didn't expect you to be able to hunt.
I couldn't have done it either.
You never killed an animal before.
But I want to! I'm warning you,
don't treat me like a loser!
Did I? I didn't ask you to go hunting!
You act like I'm a leper!
You've changed.
The hell I have! Truth is, you only let
me under your skirt when I'm a lawyer!
I got no chance in the desert,
unshaved and sweaty.
- Watch your tongue!
- I'm your husband!
I can tell you what I think,
even if you don't like it!
You have no right to a privileged life!
We've just been lucky up to now.
Stop playing the spoiled daughter,
and wake up to what's going on here!
Where are you going?
To the bar.
But now that we've brought it up,
the way you treat Owuor...
reminds me of some people in Germany...
to whom you certainly
don't want to be compared!
It's nice and warm.
Yeah, nice and warm.
Hey, little dog. Where did you come from?
- Cepoi, whose dog is this?
- This dog has no home.
It's a wild dog. It comes from the huts.
Daddy, this dog has no home.
Can I keep him, please?
- But you're afraid of dogs.
- No, not here.
Yes, I like him. We'll keep him.
We'll call him Rummler,
like the Nazi chairman in Leobschütz.
- Rummler is a nice name.
- Exactly.
Every day we can say,
"Rummler, you bastard"...
and nobody will arrest us.
The trucks! They're driving fast!
Mr. Redlich I have to arrest you.
We're at war.
Süsskind!
- What does it mean?
- Don't you listen to the radio?
War has broken out. We're being interned.
You don't think I'll leave Jettel
and Regina here!
Don't worry.
The British are reliable.
They're taking us to Nairobi.
- Tell me I have nothing to fear.
- You have my word of honor.
I'm not going away!
Owuor! Take care of the two!
Yes, bwana. I will.
May I take this, too?
No, only one thing.
Either the bear or the doll.
Let me help you.
Don't forget your passport.
- You speak German?
- Yes.
My mother is German.
Don't cry, little memsaab!
I'll find you everywhere, and follow you.
Promise?
Promise. I'll catch a new Toto for you.
No, I don't want a new Toto.
I didn't protect him very well.
His mother should have looked after him.
I'm not a good mother for an antelope baby.
You're wise, little memsaab.
Take care of our things!
Goodbye, Owuor! Goodbye, Rummler!
Suddenly, we were no longer refugees,
but enemy aliens.
We really didn't know why
the British wanted to lock us up.
We were Germans,
and England and Germany were at war...
but, after all, we were Jews
who certainly didn't side with Hitler.
Ok, ladies. Get down, please.
What a nice prison, Mama.
This is your room. Stay here until dinner,
do you understand?
- Do you understand all this?
- No.
They probably didn't know where to put us.
- I bet that's a plum pudding.
- What's that?
Something English.
Isn't this really exaggerated?
These're enemy aliens.
These are our standards, sir, and...
management is not willing to compromise.
We're at war!
Even then, at war.
This reminds me of better times.
- In the end we'll have to pay for this.
- The chef worked on a luxury liner.
- He can't help it.
- I'm really hungry!
This is lobster, fish.
No, thanks.
No, thanks.
In Breslau, we were always going
to dinner parties and receptions.
I tell you, it was such a nice life.
Before emigration every jerk was a prince.
Are you finished? Thank you.
No message for your husband?
It's the feeling of being alone...
of knowing
that you really have nothing to say...
nothing to share but the time you spend
together, and a child maybe.
It's a painful realization.
You know what I mean?
Oh, well.
Being alone is one thing.
I know all about it.
But with a woman like Jettel...
such a beautiful woman...
So cheerful and full of life.
Maybe you aren't giving her a real chance.
Back in Leobschütz everything was fine.
We both played our parts.
You see.
She won't accept reality.
I want a mature woman I can talk to.
I have to cope with everything, too.
My father, Liesl...
Will you shut up!
Sometimes I think we're like two packages.
All tied up, lying in a train...
which is taking us to an unknown address.
We travel a long way together,
but we don't really know what's inside.
You worry too much.
Perhaps. Sleep well.
After a few weeks,
the hotel wanted to get rid of us.
Every day we wandered with our mothers
from one shady spot to the next...
wondering about
what we were having for dinner.
If only we could go out for a walk.
I'm going crazy in here.
If my husband were interned,
I'd fight to have him released...
instead of sitting here complaining.
- But how?
- Mama, I'm hungry!
- Hey, you greedy little pig.
- You're all Jews.
Why don't you write a letter
to your community in Nairobi?
Jews here have influence, don't they?
That'd be the first time.
Can anyone speak English?
I can.
The Jewish community had no problem
convincing the British...
that not every German sided with Hitler.
Two weeks later, we were allowed
to visit the men at the internment camp.
Wearing khakis, it was nearly impossible
to distinguish...
between our imprisoned fathers
and the British soldiers.
Papa, I have a girlfriend, a real girlfriend!
Her name is Inge. And she can read.
And Mama wrote a letter.
A letter?
So we could visit you.
- You wrote a letter to the British?
- Not just me. All the women.
- Maybe we can return to Rongai soon?
- What's changed your mind?
You were desperately unhappy there.
Like something to drink?
- They all want to go back to their farms.
- I see.
- We can't return to Rongai.
- What?
Morrison fired me because of the war.
He doesn't want an enemy alien on his farm.
What does that mean?
I'm out of work, and we have no home.
We'll have to pick up our things at the farm.
Maybe he's still waiting for us...
because he thinks that we're coming back.
Maybe Papa will see Owuor.
- And he'll bring him here.
- Of course.
Of course.
Good morning, I need a special...
a special permission.
Yes, good morning madam. Would you be set
and give me your name first, please?
Special permission...
I said: your name, please.
Sir, if I may be of any assistance,
I speak her language.
Could I be of assistance?
Yes, please. I need a "special permission."
I have to leave the premises for a few
hours to meet Mr. Edward Rubens...
the head of the Jewish community
in Nairobi. It's urgent.
There we are!
Please help yourself, Mrs. Redlich.
My husband and I were in Berlin...
in '36 for the Olympics.
That was our last time in Germany.
My God, we were naive!
It was no different with us.
We believed to the bitter end...
No, thanks.
That our civilized friends would stop Hitler.
Friends?
The Germans were never friends
to the Jews.
I don't agree.
Where are your "friends" now? And in '38?
- Without Hitler...
- Hitler didn't invent anti-Semitism.
Sweetheart, I don't think she came
here to discuss politics with you.
What is she here for, then?
How can we be of assistance?
Mr. Morrison, the owner of our farm...
won't employ any enemy aliens.
But without work,
Walter can't leave the camp...
and we don't know
where to find a job for him.
So, I ask you to help us again.
We'd do everything to be good farmers.
For Heaven's sake!
And that's why you've come to me?
You think you're the only people
to suffer from this stupid war?
You think we're responsible for you,
because we let you enter this country?
You're alive! You're here!
My God! Make something out of it!
- Eddie! 
- I'm sorry, I can't help you! Excuse me.
We have relatives in Europe, in Poland.
My husband hasn't heard from them
for months.
Sorry to hear that.
Well, good luck, my dear. Please take
these biscuits for your little girl.
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
What are you doing here?
Was your little outing successful?
Maybe I can do something for you?
What do you mean?
You're looking for a job
on a farm for your husband?
I have a friend here in the army.
He needs someone.
I could talk to him.
That would be very nice of you.
You're very beautiful, Mrs. Redlich.
- Come on.
- I tagged you!
Catch me!
Where have you been? A letter for you.
It looks quite important.
Darn it! How do you say "morgen?"
My gosh, Jettel! It's "tomorrow!"
Try to remember that!
You see? You got it!
Pussycat, pussycat, where have you been?
I've been to London, to see the Queen!
Pussycat, pussycat, what did you there?
I caught a little mouse under the chair!
Oh, Regina!
Walter!
- How did you manage it?
- What?
My daddy is back!
My daddy is back from prison.
The holy mountain
looks like a Chinaman's hat.
Get down from there!
You're going to break your neck!
This is the most beautiful place
in the whole world!
Thank you.
Süsskind, I'm afraid.
Afraid of what?
This place is further away
from your farm than Rongai.
You can hardly ever visit us.
I'd drive 20 miles more to see you.
Promise?
I'll be here more often than you like.
At least we've gotten rid
of those damn cattle.
Are you doing all right?
- I'm your bwana, and I order you...
- Well, bwana?
...to take off your blouse.
- Are you meshuga, or what?
If you do you'll get a fried chicken.
And now you have to walk down the path
like an African woman.
Hey! Did you miss me in your hotel?
Ouch! What are you doing?
Good morning.
My name is Walter Redlich.
I'm the new bwana here.
You'll need my help.
- I've lived here for 40 years.
- I'd appreciate your help.
- Is Bwana Gibson dead?
- No.
Bwana Gibson can't be here.
He's serving in the Royal Army.
He asked me to run his farm.
Show me what to do.
You aren't a British bwana?
No, I didn't come here to get rich.
I came here because I was chased
out of my own country.
- What country are you from?
- Germany.
It is far away from here. It is at war.
If someone steals your cow...
it will be killed and eaten.
And you can forget it.
But if someone steals your land,
it is always there.
You can visit it. It will always be there.
You can never forget it.
Daji Jiwan is Indian. He's a good Fundi.
He can help you build the house.
When you work for me you will get maize...
