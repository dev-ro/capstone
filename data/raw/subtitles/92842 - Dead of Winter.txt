everybody thought
she would settle down
and come back
and finish the film,
but it has been
a week now,
and they are stuck.
have they closed down
the production?
oh, no.
they're up
in Canada,
shooting every foot
of every scene
in which
she's not involved,
but, you see,
she is the lead.
there is only so much
they can do without her,
so they must
find somebody
as quickly as possible
to fill her role.
to finish--
are you offering me
the part?
I am offering you
a chance at it.
you will have to go
upstate for a few days,
where we will
make you over.
you'll do a scene
on videotape.
that's so
the director can see
what you look like
on the screen.
now, for that,
you would be paid...
here. $3,000.

the payment schedules,
the release forms,
the union papers.
everything's covered.
I will send a copy
of that
to your agent

she's only dangerous
to herself.
last night she got hold
of a steak knife
and cut off
her own finger.

it took us all morning
to suture the wound,
didn't it, Julie?

my name is
Katie McGovern.
tom, do you want
to see her papers?

sometimes her imagination
gets the better of her.
please! go look
in the attic.
she'll be all right
in a few minutes.
hmm. maybe we ought
to take a look.
I don't think you should
encourage her.
I think we should leave.
look, john, put the lady's
mind at rest. go up--
I really don't think
it's not necessary.
it can't hurt.
it might calm her down.
I m gonna have to write out
a report anyway.

there are only
6 covered bridges
in this part
of new York state.
yeah? so?
only 4 of them
go anywhere
near the thruway.
right.
according to this,
Katie said
she was on the road
about a few hours.
right.
let's figure somewhere
between 2 and 4.
ok! ok!
so, of the 4
you can get to
off the highway,
one is only an hour
from the city.
2 are 5 hours
away, minimum.
the only other one
is just east of here.
it's about 1/2 a mile
away from the next exit.

you shouldn't
wander around
up there
all by yourself.
I mean,
it's a pretty old house,
and you don't know

in this house
that I don't know about.

dr. Lewis wants you
to stay away from her.
