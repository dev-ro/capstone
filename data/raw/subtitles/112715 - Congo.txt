RUDY:
Dr. Ross, we've got satellite from the Congo.
-What did he say, Rudy?
-I can't repeat it here.
—
t's Charles.
—
t's Charles.
-It won't work.
—He changed the code?
The old man's got me changing it
every three hours.
-Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.
-Very inventive.
Just in time.
We should have a visual momentarily.
-They said they found it.
-You're kidding.
Seven volcanoes, and he picks the right one.
His 
uck's finally changed.
—Karen.
—
 read you, Charles. And I see you.
Well, eureka and all that.
I found the bloody thing.
[RUMBLING]
-What was that?
-The usual.
This whole place does the shimmy.
-How's the volcano?
-Acting very much like a volcano...
...thank you very much.
They tell me it's ﬁne,
but I wouldn't build condominiums.
Charles, did you really find it?
Chemically flawless,
blue diamond alluvia.
Johnny—on—the-spot phasic laser.
This will look kind of raw
without a real diamond.
[CHARLES CHUCKLES]
Would you say that test
came back positive?
Oh, my God.
We found the sand in a mineral stream.
Jeffrey's searching for the source.
-I'll get Travis.
—Wait. Jeffrey should share the glory.
-Let's link up again in, uh, one hour.
-Great.
-See you in an hour.
—Give me your coordinates.
Char--? Charles...?
[KEYBOARD CLICKING]
-Jeffrey.
JEFFREY: Charlie, over here.
Charlie, lthink this
may be really something.
-We haven't got much time.
-I'll show you.
[CHARLES GRUNTS]
Jump in.
-What?
-I'll go first.
J effrey!
J effrey!
[CHARLES COUGHING]
CHARLES: What is this?
—Come on.
From below itjust looks like jungle,
but it's notjustjungle. See?
CHARLES:
Jesus Christ.
This is a big deal.
This is a big find.
I can't believe it's just sitting here.
All these centuries, waiting for lucky us.
[RUMBLING]
Listen, I raised Houston,
they're getting the old man.
Come on camera and share the glory.
-We'll have to get another team here.
—All right. Let me grab my bag.
-Perfect, you say? A flawless diamond?
KAREN: He found it. He was right.
With the right laser and diamonds...
...we can dominate
the communications industry over night.
Has he found the source?
KAREN: Charles says a laser with a diamond
like that can punch a hole in the moon.
TRAVIS:
Shh. Don't say any more out here.
Come on, Jeffrey. Jeffrey!
Come on, we're supposed to transmit
in 10 minutes.
[THUDDING AND RUSTLING]
Now you're throwing stuff at me?
[GROWLING]
[SCREAMING]
—Where is he?
-I don't know.
—He should have transmitted 10 minutes ago.
-Ugh.
-Activate the remote.
—Yes, sir.
—I guess he's still looking for Jeffrey.
TRAVIS: Hmm. Pan the camera.
What in God's name...?
[ROARING]
Lock your remote. Back scan.
Give me thermal readout.
[ROARING]
KAREN: I can see seven dead people.
-What's that sound?
[SNARLING]
-I didn't see him. Charles!
-What?
[TRAVIS GRUNTS]
-I'll get help.
—You can't get out. I had the code changed.
Well, what is it?
Rudy?
-Sir?
-Use the fire extinguisher on that.
-What's the code, sir?
-Do what I say!
-No one knows this happened but us.
-Families have to be be notified. Your wife.
We don't know he's dead.
If it's reported, they'll close the border.
-What was that thing?
-Uh, baboon.
-I thought it was a gorilla, but I've never--
-Gorillas didn't kill. Gorillas don't do that.
—It could have been locals, a rival company.
-Not another paranoid fantasy.
I need those diamonds, Dr. Ross!
—Are you for real?
-It's the future.
-Most believe children are the future.
-40,000 people, they all depend on me.
This satellite is our cash cow.
In three years it'll be obsolete. I need
a new cash machine. This diamond's it!
-Charles knew it. That's why he went.
—He went into the Congo to please you.
—I know you had feelings for him.
-I almost married him.
Listen to me, talking like he's--
You have to go down there, Dr. Ross.
You're good in the field.
You were good in Panama. Once you're local...
...that laser's power pack
should give off a readable signal.
Find some expedition that's already going.
Take it over.
What are you talking about?
There's no time! Once we let out what's
happened, Zaire will shut the border.
-By the time the investigation's--
-Are you human?
I'll be human later.
Hire people when you get there. Good people.
Never mind, I'll have some waiting.
-Find out what happened to Charles.
—Tell me you love your son.
—I do.
—And that's why you're sending me.
It is.
All right. But if! have one moment when
I think otherwise, I'll make you sorry.
That's a promise.

PETER: Wow. Isn't that beautiful?
What's Amy's favorite color?
Green, that's right.
How green was my va

ey.... Drop that!
Good. Pretty. So pretty.
No, Amy, on the paper. Yeah, okay, good.
Amy, get some more paint.
[AMY GRUNTING]
Good. That's green.
No, Amy, on the paper.
On-- On the paper.
Good. That's good.
Good girl. Such a pretty girl.
That's your lovey. That's your lovey.
Amy! Hey, you!
[GRUNTING]
—How did she sleep?
-Great night.
-No nightmares?
-Not a one.
Good girl.
That's my Amy.
Richard, you better clean her up.
It's showtime.
PETER:
When we started out, it was so simple.
Communication is what separated
human from animal. Speech.
And for those humans who had
am impairment that inhibited speech...
...sign language. An alphabet in gestures.
Words in motion. Then came virtual reality.
Sensors worn like clothing could read
and replicate the body's movements.
Arliss Wender at MIT was the first to
apply this technology to sign language.
Our subject, William,
was born without the organs of speech.
Isn't that right, William?
COMPUTER VOICE:
That is absolutely right.
[AUDIENCE CHATTERING]
COMPUTER VOICE: This is the ﬁrst time
I have ever heard my own voice.
[APPLAUSE]
Lights, please.
It's hard to get grants for what I do.
Most people just don't believe it.
They think it's a parlor trick. A gag.
But it's no gag, ladies and gentlemen.
With this new technology,
I can demonstrate it...
...in a way it has never been possible
to demonstrate it before.
Animals can talk.
Amy, could you come down
here please?
[GRUNTING QUIETLY]
Hello, Amy. Thank you for the flowers.
AMY:
Peter. Hello, Peter.
MAN:
Wow.
Amy, how old are you?
AMY:
Amy 7. Amy good gorilla.
-Amy pretty.
-Yes, you are.
This is a talking gorilla, Moira.
This gorilla is talking!
-I know, Boyd.
BOYD: But this is really happening.
-This isn't Mr. Ed.
-I know it's not Mr. Ed.
Amy, look at me.
AMY: Amy mother.
-That's right. That's your baby.
AMY: Amy wants lunch.
-Okay.
-What do you think, Mrs. Romy?
—It's spooky. Very spooky.
PETER: Amy's above average intelligence
for a gorilla, but she's not a freak.
What she has learned,
other gorillas have learned and can learn.
But that takes money, of course.
Isn't that right, Amy?
[GROWLING]
[SHOUTING]
Amy, calm down. Easy.
Hey, hey, hey! Shh, shh.
It's okay. You're all right.
-You've got her sedated. She'll be fine.
-She's not gonna be fine. Nightmares again.
It's happened before. Gorillas in captivity
degenerating mentally, having to be destroyed.
When she did these paintings
she got better. Why?
Hey, hey....
What's this room starting to look like?
-The Jungle, she's been painting the jungle!
-I don't know, Peter.
She wants to go home.
Peter, you did a great job. You taught
a gorilla to talk, to paint, for gosh sakes.
When it comes to Amy, you can get a grant
for anything except setting her free.
How about this. I taught her,
now she can teach them.
-Who?
-The mountain gorillas.
We can translate
what other animals are saying.
Oh, please. Making you Dr. Doolittle?
There isn't a foundation in motion that would
fund an expedition with that objective.
MAN:
I will pay.
-I will pay for Amy to go home.
-And who are you?
Herkermer Homolka. Formerly of Romania.
Free now of the chains of Ceaucescu.
Traveling the world, doing good.
-A Romanian philanthropist?
-Herkermer Homolka.
—Something's voodoo.
-Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.
I don't think it's penetrating.
We're taking Amy home. Get packed.
[AMY GRUNTING]
Do you know where we're going?
Amy, where are we going?
AMY: Jungle. Me jungle.
-She's really excited.
—Are you excited?
-Me? I'm terrified.
AMY: Jungle.
—Safari? I don't even like picnics. Nice glasses.

—Is there a problem?
-Not unless there's a problem.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
Are you excited, sweetheart?
That's a camera. Be careful, it's expensive.
I think she's got a real eye.
—Karen Ross. Professor Karen Ross.
—Professor Peter Elliot.
—Doctor.
—Doctor.
Have you got my faxes,
Fed Exes and phone calls?
-I'm sorry, you're the one.
-Yes, I'm the one.
We've put together a hasty expedition.
To the Congo, with a talking gorilla.
AMY: Jungle me. Jungle. Tickle Amy.
-That's right, jungle. Just a minute, Amy.
-I'm sorry-- I'm afraid that's impossible.
-I need to join up with you.
-Excuse me.
-Yeah?
-I have all the visas.
-Go ahead and load this stuff on the plane.
-We're taking this stuff off the plane.
-Off the plane?
-I can pay part of the cost.
-Why take stuff off the plane?
-I'm sorry, we don't need any money.
-You're flying way under capacity.
You can easily find room for me.
-It's not a matter of that. It's Amy.
AMY: Ugly woman.
-The gorilla?
—She gets jealous very easily.
Somebody tell me
why you're unloading the plane.
—Talk to the operations guy.
-Can't you tell me?
-No.
-I've gotta get on this plane.
I've got to be listed with your manifest,
or my visas are worthless. Name your price.
I don't have a price.
I'm not a pound of sugar, I'm a primatologist.
Don't be hasty, Dr. Elliot.
Herkermer Homolka,
formerly of Romania.
-Dr. Karen Ross.
-There seems to be some glitch.
-They're unloading the plane.
—Yes.
[CHUCKLES]
Unfortunately there has been
a slight interruption in my credit flow.
—I am unable to pay for the fuel.
-I'll pay for the fuel.
-I'll pay for it. How much is the fuel?

Please make sure that your seat belts
are fastened and that all carry—on....
We're returning her to the jungle
from whence she came.
From the look of it, not a moment too soon.
-You're the reason she's upset.
-Me? What did I do?
AMY: Ugly woman.
—Yes, very ugly.
Now let's get your seat belt on.
Forgive me. I'll explain later.
See? I'm buckling my seat belt.
-We're all buckling our seat belts.
PETER: You can do it.
That's it. Good girl. Here's an egg.
Unh.
PETER: We do not throw things.
-Is that animal dangerous?
Humans are dangerous,
gorillas are very gentle.
So you think the gorilla
may be dangerous? Maybe so.
-Don't perpetuate a myth.
-What myth?
The King Kong myth,
the myth of the killer ape.
-Are you certain there aren't gorillas that kill?
—P
ease, doctor. You can't be serious.
What's your area of expertise,
folk singing?
-Communications technology.
-You're a geek with a cell phone.
I'm a scientist. But you and your protégé...
...as far as I can see, belong in the circus.
Listen, just because you came up with
a wad of cash at the crucial moment--
It's okay, Amy.
AMY:
Where ground?
-Where ground?
PETER: It's fine. We're flying.
-We're going to the jungle.
AMY: Amy want green drop drink.
-No.
AMY: Amy want green drop drink.
All right, all right.
[AMY GRUNTS]
You'd swear they were married.
The notion of the "killer ape" may be politically
incorrect, but that's not to say it's untrue.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
[GRUNTING]
Cliches usually contain some
element of truth.
-Are you serving that ape a martini?
-She's allowed one. It'll calm her down.
In my life I have heard
many a bizarre story.

[AMY SNORING]
PETER: Dr. Ross,
I'm sorry I called you ugly, but if I didn't....
I know, it was for Amy's benefit.
—Can I ask you something?
—Sure.
Why teach an ape to talk?
Why teach at all? Why teach anything
to anyone? It doesn't make you rich.
Doesn't get you girls.
Why did Prometheus steal fire
only to turn around and give it away?
There's an inherent generosity
in the human spirit.
One of its faces is the face of the teacher.
I repeat, why teach an ape to talk?
-No practical reason.
-Then why did you do it?
"A lonely impulse of delight."
-William Butler Yeats.
-Very good.
-Did it work?
-What do you mean?
You're not lonely anymore?
Why are you going to Africa?
To find something I lost.

But I don't supply assholes with new
personalities. Wanna see your new plane?
Let's go! Hold on.
-Wanna sell that gorilla?
-No.
-Worth a lot of money.
-How much?
-Mr. Homolka, I can't believe you.
-I'm just curious.
Twenty, twenty-five grand for a female.
AMY: Amy want to go home. Go home.
-I'm taking you home, Amy.
Whoa, a talking gorilla! I feel the money hairs
on the back of my neck going woo, woo, woo.
Mr. Travis told me to load you up. The works.

-We already arranged for a guide.
—Robertson Reynolds.
-Yeah, I fired him.
-You what?
—Reynolds is a bird—watcher.
—I hired Robertson Reynolds.
-You would.
You have any idea what's going on
in the Congo as of this morning?
The Kigani have had it with Zaire
and they're eating people.
You go in with Reynolds, you're coming out
somebody's bowel movement.
There you go. Now wasn't that
easier than going through customs?
Monroe.
-Guess what?
EDDIE: What?
-We need to switch airports.
-Oh, shit, why?
Bomb in the president's car.
It was the president's car? Did they get him?
That's the bad news. No, they didn't.
—I hope you folks have lots of money.
-We do.

Whenever the leadership of one of these little
Central African countries comes into question...
...they tend to murder everybody.
-Oh, my God!
-Not really?
They live for the opportunity to settle scores.
And they've got a lot of scores to settle.
It's like what's going on in the Congo.
-Things are pretty bad in the Congo.
-We heard.
MONROE:
The Kigani are pissed off.
Can't blame them. The 20th century sucks.
Maybe the 21st will be better.
-You some kind of criminal, aren't you?
-Aren't we all?
No. I'm not a criminal, I'm a scientist.
Scientist?
I run a few guns,
you sons of bitches ruin the world.
I don't think it's a good idea to have
further involvement with these people.
What would you suggest we do, Dr. Elliot?
As soon as we can,
we should go our own way.
-Ugh.
MONROE: Don't I know you?
Perhaps. I travel a great deal.
-What are you doing with that gorilla?
-Taking her home.
She was caught
in the Virunga region of the Congo.
You're going to try and take her back
to the farm now that she's seen Paris?
—And this is your cover?
—Yes.
Pretty good. Or, it would have been.
—I'm nobody's cover. Cover for what?
-You find yourself in the middle of something.
-Cover for what?
-I don't know, and she won't tell you.
But the kind of money
her company is throwing around?
They don't spend that for any gorilla.
Relax. You're in better hands
than you should be.

did you know?
It's a big plot.

—You need the truck.
You also need ten good men to the border.
More.

-It does exist!
-Fine.

-A fourth was shot by we don't know who.
-It was an appalling suicide.
We won't quibble. And Mr. Homolka

Fine. I'm taking a safari

Such an extraordinary animal.
Those paintings. Do you think she was

Or in a dream, maybe?
-I think she was drawing a jungle, home.

—Perhaps.

-A little bit of both.
-Ah.
—So why did you quit the CIA?
-I never worked for the CIA.
Of course you didn't.
But if you had worked for the CIA,
why would you quit?
Because they're a loveless bunch

—And you're not?
-And I'm not.
Glad to hear it.
—Okay, here we go.

She's after something.
You're after something.
What you're after, I've got figured.
But what she's after, I don't know.
I'll get you! I'll get you!
I'm helping that young scientist
return his ward to the wild.
He says the ape may be able to tell us
the thoughts of the wild gorillas.
Well I can tell you your thoughts.
You're looking for King Solomon's
diamonds. The lost city of Zinj.
-I've given it up.
-You'll never give it up.
The problem is, Herkermer, it doesn't exist.
Solomon must have gotten his diamonds
from Cartiers, like everybody else.

He doesn't know what, but it's gorilla—like.
Are you sufficiently armed?

Good. The bad news is geo-thermal.
You've got to hurry.
That region in the Virungas is bad.
Sometimes the volcanic activity...

The region's going to blow.

KAREN: What is this Zinj, Mr. Homolka?
-I don't know what you're talking about.
It's been believed that King Solomon
had a diamond mine in the Congo...
...in a city called Zinj.
Diamonds?
I suppose there's no point
in playing stupid.
We shall arrive there together,
we shall all be rich.
That's fine with me. Except there's no Zinj.
Half the safaris that have gone in looking
never made it back.
The other half came back with nothing.
Yes, but we have a trumping card
that they did not have.
-We do?
-We do. That gorilla...
-...knows where it is.
KAREN: What?
MONROE:
The gorilla?
As a young man,
I found a book in Soviet Georgia.
It contained a detailed drawing
of the city of Zinj.
The drawing contained
a peculiar decoration.
An open eye.
Later, on safari, I found this.
It's the same symbol. Now...
...look at this.
The gorilla drew this.
It is the same image. It is the open eye.
That gorilla has seen the city of Zinj.
-And she will take us there!
—Have you been taking your medication?
[MONROE & HOMOLKA CHUCKLE]

-We've lost two porters.

—Ran away.
-And they didn't invite me?
PETER:
You want your glove? All right, sit still.
This, as they say, is a fork in the road.
We could go left or we could go right.
We go the wrong way,
we lose two or three days.
We must follow the gorilla. Where she leads.

Travis, my boss, thought I wasn't gonna

They instantly fell upon

The diamonds flowed
