Okay.
Let's turn over, please.
Yeah.
So, we're gonna

He can't really get up.
So the doctor said to...
To phone an ambulance

You're in this dark tunnel.
But as you come out,
and you look to the sunshine,
you see...
more than
half the ground's United.
Memories.
I told them, there's a guy
there that bit me.
He said, well the next time,
bite him back.
Bite him bloody back.
Saying to yourself...
I'll never see this again.
Surely now?
♪ Pack up your troubles
In your old kit bag ♪
That was it. That was the song.
Bobby Charlton waved down at me.
Memories.
This is the hard knocks game.
I could handle it.
It was a lovely day.
I woke up...
It was pouring with rain.
Britain's most successful
ever football manager,
Alex Ferguson...
Former
Manchester United manager
is being treated for
a brain hemorrhage.
A very
competitive man in football,
but as such, a divisive figure.
He has achieved
unparalleled success over five decades...
Famous
pupils, Cristiano Ronaldo,
David Beckham,
"Keep fighting boss!
Sending prayers and love to
Cathy and the whole family."
We're in this side room.
The doctor said, "Look, Mr
Ferguson, I'm afraid to say,
you've had a bleed on the brain.
We're going to have to get you
up to Salford Royal Hospital
as soon as possible
for an operation."
And all of a sudden, he just...
He just put his head
in his hands and went, "Ugh!
I hope there's nothing
wrong with my memory.
There better be nothing
wrong with my memory."
And I was like, "Right?"
And then he just started
telling these random stories.
Where the only connection
between any of them
was the fact that they all
happened a long time ago.
I think he's telling me
these stories
to keep himself convinced
that he's still...
got a memory.
My mother...
took the big pram and I...
up to the local park in Glasgow.
And I always remember...
right opposite us...
was the shipyard.
We lived in the shadow of that.
You work on these ships.
The wind's flying down
that bloody River Clyde.
Oh, Jesus God.
You feel that wind?
My father worked there
for over 40 years.
My dad.
I'll tell you
what happens, right.
That history.
It gets ingrained into you.
Think about it.
Me as a manager,
I used to lie in bed
thinking about themes
where I could address the players
that would make an impact on them.
You know...
I would talk about miners,
shipyard workers,
welders, toolmakers.
You know, people who've
come from poor backgrounds.
And I used to ask them,
what did your grandfather do?
What did your father do?
But I have to get
the-the feeling inside them
that what their grandfathers
worked for,
and their grandmothers,
is part of them.
And they have to... they
have to display that meaning.
And... taking away
all the-the trophies I've won
and the great players I've had,
I think it's a thing about life.
It's a fact of life that where
we come from is important.
You come out with an identity.
I come from Govan.
I'm a Govan boy.
I loved it because it was
buzzing, you know.
People selling fruit in barrows.
All sorts of things
were going on.
The place was alive.
But, um, there was
another side to it.
From time to time
you would come up
against, uh,
guys from different areas.
These were really tough areas.
And sometimes
I had to defend my brother.
Martin.
Alec was always a leader.
Always wanted to be
the guy in front, you know.
Alec was always first to be in.
There was a boy
bullying Martin.
So I went up to the boy's house.
His father came to the door and
says, "What do you want son?"
I said, "I want to see your son.
He's been bullying my brother."
He says, "That's not my
business." And he closed the door.
So I got him
on the playground...
He was...
wee sturdy wee guy, you know?
And anyway,
he never bullied Martin again.
Everyone has
their own personality.
Some walk away from things.
Some say, "No, I'm not
going to accept this."
When you're growing up
in a place like Govan,
most people are fighting
to get out of there.
It's the capitalist attitude
to the working class.
Keep them down there.
Absolutely no doubt about that.
And I was lucky because...
the football was the savior.
Through that,
I got all the breaks.
I progressed.
My Dad,
he played a part in that.
He followed us everywhere.
He always encouraged us.
Made sure we were in bed early
the day before a game.
And there was clubs
starting to approach my Dad.
But the one I was hoping that
would go for me was Rangers.
I was a big Rangers fan.
Lived right behind the stadium.
But anyway, my dad
wouldn't let me go full-time.
Apprenticeship first,
and then you can go full-time.
He was trying to protect me in
case I didn't make it as a footballer.
But I don't think
it did me any harm,
serving my apprenticeship
as a toolmaker.
It helped me I think,
in understanding people.
The unity.
No establishment honor
can compare
with the privilege of belonging
to the Scottish working class.
My mother...
she was a strong,
really strong person.
She was a strong socialist.
And, uh... I was a shop
steward for the apprentices.
The apprentices strike, that was
a really important moment for me.
It was great,
being a part of it.
It wasn't about you,
it was about us.
It was about being a team.
Nothing more important
than someone
who's had hard times
but prepared to
not give into it.
But then, when I was
serving my apprenticeship...
I was part time at football,
at St. Johnstone.
I was having to travel up there,
three days a week.
That was a nightmare for me.
Getting home
at half one in the morning.
Getting up at six.
And then, I was getting despondent
about the football side of it,
because I wasn't a first team
player all the time.
My career
was going down the pan.
And I started to...
How would you put it?
I went off the rails a bit.
Going out in town, you know.
♪ Well, in the evening
when the sun is sinking low ♪
♪ All day I been waiting
for the whistle to blow ♪
Started to go out
Friday nights even,
the day before the game.
♪ Until the foreman
comes back ♪
♪ Pick up
your belongings boys ♪
♪ And scatter about
My Dad...
"Where are you going?" You know.
"I'm going out,
going to the dancing."
"You've got a game tomorrow.
You can't go to the dancing
if you've got a game tomorrow."
I said,
"Well, says it's the reserves,
and it doesn't mean a lot,
you know."
He says, "It means everything,
you know."
That's when we fell out.
Well, it got to a point
where he said,
"Go your own way,
and we'll see what happens."
And then we weren't
talking to one another.
So for two years, between
1961 and 1963, we didn't talk.
And then one night I went out,
and I got drunk.
And I ended up in a fight.
Ended up in jail.
I went to court,
I got fined three pound.
I was a bit of a black sheep.
It's always been in the
back of my head, that period.
And, uh,
I've always regretted that.
Here's me, with that sort of a
background and upbringing I had,
I surrendered.
I said to myself, I'm finished.
Football, it's going nowhere.
The immigration boom
touched new heights
in a novel way.
From Heathrow and Prestwick,
25,000 will fly to begin
a new life in the dominion.
I took out papers
to emigrate to Canada.
I got the forms
and all the rest of it.
Then that break in my life came,
you know, fate.
The most important game
of my life.
He was supposed
to play in a reserve game.
And he thought, "I'm not
going up to Perth. To hell with it."
I got my brother's girlfriend
to phone the manager,
tell him I had the flu.
Kidding on
that she was my mother
And I got home about seven.
And my mother's going
absolutely berserk with me.
'Cause what had happened,
the manager had sent her
a telegram that says, "I know
that wasn't you that phoned me."
And she says, "You get along
to that man right now."
And you'd better phone him, and
you'd better be apologising to him.
And I've got the handkerchief
over the phone.
Pretending I've got a bad cold.
He says, "You'd better report
tomorrow at the Buchanan Street Hotel.
You're playing tomorrow
against Rangers."
So, I go to the game.
And I scored a hat-trick.
Unbelievable, eh?
He was the first person
to score a hat-trick at Ibrox.
Nobody had ever done it before.
I did... I wanted to go home
and see my dad.
You know what I mean.
I wanted to go home because I
knew he'd be proud as peacock, and...
And my mother,
she's all excited and she says,
"Go on, talk to him."
"What do you think, Dad?"
"All right, yeah, it was okay.
Yeah."
And then he starts.
"That's the boy I had.
That's the... shoot on sight."
We're back, we're back pals.
That changed my life.
Seriously that... it was
the biggest break of my life.
And I say that to people often now,
I say, "Don't miss a big opportunity."
You know, you might
only get one in your life.
And that was my one in life.
That was the one
that mattered to me.
And I made a vow,
that moment on,
that I was not looking back.
I was committed.
That was it. I was committed.
Nothing but football for me.
The brain controls everything.
Your experience is all stored
in your brain, in your memories.
And by that I think you make up
your-your identity as a person.
Childhood, adolescence,
the memories make Alex Ferguson
him as him.
I remember falling. That's all.
After that,
I don't remember a thing.
I just sudden... stopped.
I just stopped.
I was in no... no-man's-land.
So I remember
estimating his mortality
at that point in time
as 80 percent.
As in, there was an 80 percent
chance he would not survive.
And then,
the doctor came and said,
"Look, we're about to
take him down
for the operation."
Two people can go in and see him
before he gets operated on.
So I said, look,
I'll take my mom in.
And it was a shock.
My mom was, "Whoa!"
There was wires everywhere
and all the rest of it.
And then, that-that was hard.
I felt it then, really.
Um... Sorry.
So...
As we opened the
head, we found a large clot.
But if you
cut off the blood vessel,
then that part
of the brain dies.
So, sometimes you
just apply pressure and wait.
And so, I do remember waiting,
and waiting.
And after a while,
the bleeding stopped.
The brain started resurfacing,
which I thought was a good sign.
I think that day there was
five brain hemorrhages.
That day I was... and three died.
Only two survived,
I was one of them.
So, you know,
you know you're lucky.
It was beautiful weather.
I always remember that.
And you're looking out the
hospital window, and you're...
and you're saying,
I wonder if I'll ever see...
How many sunny days
I'm ever going to see again?
You know?
And I found that difficult.
He was upset
even when I went in.
And I says to him, if you don't
calm down, I'll need to go.
Because if I'm upsetting you
as well, you have to keep calm,
you know, especially,
for the next 24 hours.
I was 22.
I had this friend,
um, she says to me,
"There's a really nice girl,
just started."
I just saw him walking through.
I'd suffered an injury at football
and I had a plaster on my face.
She thought I was either a
gangster or a boxer.
I thought he was a thug.
Then I found out
that he was a footballer.
But that didn't make... didn't make
him any different to me.
I took her to the movies.
Bought me a box
of Liquorice Allsorts,
which he ate all of them.
And a local paper
when we come out.
That was my romantic date.
We got really close.
And, you know, I really loved her.
But, you know, she was Catholic.
And my mother's Catholic
and my father was Protestant.
But we were
brought up Protestants.
Well, we're different religions.
It did cause problems.
That's the way it was then,
you know.
Glasgow...
is a city
where there's a divide.
There's Protestant, Catholic.
It's Rangers and Celtic.
The Old
Firm, Celtic and Rangers.
They've been battling now
for 75 years.
The battle is not between
a team and a team.
It's between the Prods
and the Papes.
Between Protestant and Catholic.
So we just said
we'd have a civil wedding.
We got married in 1966.
Glasgow Registry Office.
That was the start.
I went to my work.
He went to his football.
And I really did well.
Yes, it's a goal by Ferguson.
I was rumbustious, aggressive.
Ferguson! And it's a goal!
I could score goals, you know.
Ferguson!
And that was... when I heard
that Rangers wanted to sign me.
And of course, having supported
Rangers as a boy,
and lived, what,
200 yards from the ground.
I was pretty excited about that.
I get in my best suit,
and go across to Ibrox.
It was unbelievable.
This big marble hall,
you know, it's quite impressive.
It was absolutely fantastic.
Govan boy signing for Rangers.
Scottish transfer record.
♪ The wheel of fortune
It was his boyhood dream
come true.
Ferguson's there!
It's a goal by Ferguson!
♪ Will the arrow
Point my way? ♪
Ferguson scores!
On towards Ferguson.
A good goal by Ferguson! Alex
Ferguson's done what he's tried so hard...
Anyway,
my first season was over...
and we'd lost the league
in the last gasp to Celtic.
Celtic have again
proved themselves Scotland's top team.
If you don't beat Celtic,
it's not a good season.
And, uh, certain people
had the knife in Alec,
for obvious reasons, you know.
Cathy was Catholic.
When I signed for Rangers,
one of the directors,
he asked me about Cathy.
And he says, um,
I have to ask you a question
about your wife.
Uh, I believe she's Catholic.
I says, "Yeah."
He says,
"Were you married in a chapel?"
I says, "No, we got married
in a registry office."
He says, "Oh, that's okay."
Uh, you know, I should've
told him to fuck off.
You know, I really should have.
But having supported Rangers
as a boy,
and having an opportunity
to go and play for Rangers,
you're prepared
to take nonsense.
You know what I mean?
I was... I let myself down there.
And I let my wife down. And that
was, uh, was the important thing.
'Cause she was
a devout Catholic.
No, I don't...
My memories of...
With Rangers weren't
very happy anyway, you know.
It was a bad time for us.
And then, we got
the Cup Final against Celtic.
Everybody's screaming.
A hundred and thirty-two
thousand people.
And there I was,
playing number nine for Rangers.
Ferguson about to kick off.
In this, the Scottish Cup Final
here at Hampden Park.
But, as it turned out,
it wasn't about football.
It was...
It was a...
Well, there was
a price to pay for me.
And it looks like
a corner forced there.
And the thing here is that,
Billy McNeill,
the giant-sized center half
of Celtic normally comes up.
McNeill...
And he's done it,
and scored a goal!
McNeill comes up there for one
of his traditionally famous headers.
Ferguson should've been
ready for that one.
Ferguson let it go,
and paid the penalty.
Oh, God. What a start.
Oh! Bad pass back there.
Bad pass back and it puts
Lennox in the clear,
straight in he can go.
He's very fast, is Lennox.
Scoring chance. And it's there!
Celtic takes a two-nothing
lead over Rangers.
Greig. And here's a terrible
mistake there by John Greig!
Three-nothing for Celtic.
Chalmers breaking.
I was part of the team
that got slaughtered.
No one enjoys that.
And, of course,
Alec got the blame of it.
They were looking for a
scapegoat, and Alec became the scapegoat.
After that, it was like
a witch-hunt, you know.
It was my last game.
I never played again.
So, I was completely bombed out.
Trained on my own.
I can only assume it was
because of Cathy being a Catholic.
I'm sure of it.
Eventually, I left.
And I went
down-down the scale to Falkirk.
Went down that, uh,
slope a bit, you know.
Oh, I... Oh, I mean, he was
upset, you know, obviously.
And I think a bit angry,
you know.
But it made him
determined as well, you know.
He was determined that he
would go on and prove his self.
The thing that drove me
most was leaving Rangers.
That spurred me.
I was starting to question
the managers.
You know, their way of managing.
That gave me that... How was it?
That impetus about saying,
"I can do this job.
I know I can do this job."
See, because that's
my upbringing.
Don't give in.
He initially
recovered very well.
But he was still in
a certain level of danger here.
There was a day when,
uh, everybody came in.
There was about 14 people
in my room,
and, uh, that was too much,
you know.
His mind was trying to
keep up with everybody,
so he was doing too much
with the brain.
And then, he had a lapse.
Uh, quite a-a bad lapse.
My voice stopped.
Trying to get the...
And, you know, you're trying to
force it out and you can't get out.
When the doctors came in and
I was crying, you know, 'cause...
you felt helpless.
He was really upset with that
because he thought
he was going to lose his voice,
going to lose his memory.
I would have hated
if I'd have lost my memory.
It would've been a terrible
burden on-on the family.
I'm sitting in the house,
and I don't know who I am,
I don't know who you are
or who my wife is.
In many ways, that would've been
the worst thing that could've happened.
Surviving,
but losing the memory.
Two of the doctors came in
and they just said, "Write."
You know, gave me a pen, write
names. Write your family's name.
Write your friend's name.
Write your football team's names.
Write your players names.
And I just kept writing,
and writing, and writing.
And I'm thinking, "He's writing
quite a long time here".
And I went, "Right, okay.
Let's have a look".
So I took the book off him,
and he's like that.
He was like a little boy,
really, to be honest.
Aye.
It's impossible to read this.
"The remember that, remember
that, that had remember...
the remember, that remember,
that has had remember."
I've repeated the word
"remember" three times there.
Yeah.
God.
Regarding my health,
I'm not actually in control,
in the football world...
and at-at United,
I'm in control of the situation.
It's vital.
Because... a player
can't do it himself.
A player's only part of a team.
The manager's
in control of that.
He's in control
of all that destiny.
Dealing with the press,
with referees,
with rivals.
I've got to make decisions
that are correct.
You have to make
really difficult decisions.
I'm telling you,
I was never afraid of that.
I never looked back.
I never looked back because
there was always tomorrow
as far as I was concerned,
whether you lose or win.
There was always tomorrow.
But, now, if you remember,
we spoke about reflecting.
Um, I've done a lot of reflecting
on things, uh, that I achieved
and what I didn't achieve,
and I think that's been,
has been quite a challenge,
actually.
Because you're-you're
searching your memory.
And that's what I've had to do.
Aberdeen.
The Granite City.
The silver city by the sea.
I'd been part-time manager
for three and a half years
at St. Mirren.
I was offered the job to be
full-time manager at Aberdeen.
I snapped at it.
And, uh, I had my own
philosophy about management.
Hold it there.
Come on, big man Dougie.
Get that thigh on the chest.
- Hold it.
- Don't move.
Feel the back of your legs.
Hold it for a wee bit.
Obviously, I've got
my own ideas and standards.
And through time, this'll
come through to the players.
Fingers crossed.
When he first got there...
Well, we're at the level where
Aberdeen had been for years.
Where you... The fans are quite happy
if you won a trophy every six years.
And that trophy was either
the League Cup or the F.A. Cup.
That was success.
We were a group of guys,
play football
just to make a living.
But the problem was,
a lot of those players couldn't
dream of winning a league.
And incredible as it may seem,
we didn't have
a training ground at Aberdeen.
Facilities?
There's a park along from us
That wasn't that great
because you had to
kick off the dog crap, uh,
before you started training.
Yeah, the car park was used
mainly in the afternoons.
We used to go to the beach.
And we'd only stop when
the actual tide hit a goalpost.
But the only thing that mattered
was beating Rangers and Celtic.
If you don't beat Rangers and
Celtic, you don't win the league.
Simple as that.
I remember, he was desperate.
I mean, desperate to beat the
two sides, the Old Firm sides.
Rangers, I felt in particular
more than Celtic.
For some reason,
I don't know what it was.
But Rangers
was the first target.
The first time
we played at Rangers...
and we scrambled a draw
in the last minute.
After the game, the players were
all celebrating, jumping up and down.
And I'm, what,
I'm saying, "Wait a minute".
I says, "What are you celebrating?
I mean... you've only drawn."
And we'd all had kind of...
rollockings or bollockings,
whatever you want to call it,
before at different clubs.
But this was an intensity
that was not about
just that game or something.
It was... everything.
Where you want to go, what
you want to do with your life.
Forget all the work
we'd been doing,
with passing the ball and
technical ability, etcetera, etcetera.
If they're not winners,
it's a waste of time anyway.
You're trying to
get that character
instilled in the human beings
you're dealing with.
When they go on that pitch,
they can't leave
their personality
in the dressing room.
When I looked at that,
I thought there's-there's
something up here.
Somehow there's something
inside this fellow...
that's making him angry
and driving him.
Well, looking back on it now,
it looks like I bumped into
a-a wounded animal here.
Look, rather than explain
how you can bring-bring
a winning mentality to people,
I think you've got to produce
a project that's working.
Technique, mentally,
physically, the whole lot.
He put
people under so much pressure
to be successful.
You have to earn the right
to be an Aberdeen player
that I was looking for.
The coaching
and the speed of their play,
the concentration...
If you're
doing these things right,
it definitely develops
their mind better.
Deep down inside us there's
a devil that drives you on.
Um, for whatever reason,
he could make that devil
materialise for a game of football.
McMaster through to Harper.
Harper's left foot out in front.
It's going to be a goal!
Yes, it's over! It's a goal!
And, sensationally,
Aberdeen lead one-nil.
It was really a turning point
because the players
are now saying to themselves,
"Right, let's get after Celtic."
That's the one
we were after now.
Archibald and
a chance, and he scores!
Archibald scores!
There's a cross
aimed for Archibald.
Latchford drops it,
Strachan scores.
Strachan makes it three-one.
Yeah. He-he brought
the devil out in me.
You think, "Oh, we're in here."
That was the hardest bit.
Because, um... Sir Alex had
never won that league before.
None of us had won that league
before. So, it was all new to us.
And how we dealt with it.
And at that point, the manager
was the most important guy,
'cause we were looking at him
for guidance how to get through it.
Now, having beaten Celtic
twice in the past month,
is it all about conviction?
Believing in yourselves
that you-you can actually do it?
Because I've met infinite number
of Aberdonians who say,
"Ah, yes. They're a good team,
but they haven't won anything yet."
Conviction and belief
is built up in-in time.
Uh...
Mainly with the work that I do
myself with the players in, you know,
on their character and their discipline,
and having belief in themselves
and conviction in going to
places like Celtic Park and Ibrox,
and believing they can win.
Oh, that's a goal!
Steve Archibald!
Scanlon... Yes!
What a marvelous goal
to finish this match!
And that's it! They have won!
Alec Ferguson is on now
in the penalty area!
Aberdeen have definitely won
the Championship!
Alec Ferguson,
can you blame the man
for going out of his mind
temporarily?
- Yeah!
- All right.
So, I'd been looking
for an assistant for a while.
It couldn't have been better for
me. That's what I wanted to do.
That's what I enjoyed doing,
uh, the most so, uh,
it was perfect for me.
Oh, it was a nightmare,
the two of them.
Um, and it was...
It was like most managers
have bad cop, good cop.
Well, it used to be Sir Alex,
bad cop.
Worse cop...
with Archie.
After a couple of weeks,
the players...
The players must've been
saying to themselves,
"Jesus Christ.
There's two of them."
You were steeped in the thing,
football-wise.
I was steeped in it.
He never had
much of a home life.
He never saw the kids much.
That was his job.
Well, he got on with his job,
and I got on with the kids.
Cathy brought the kids up. And
I'm not... I'm not proud of that.
Five past three
on Friday afternoon,
and Aberdeen leave Pittodrie
for the drive south.
He was never there, so you see,
you always thought
he's-he's always at work.
But, um, and he was.
I mean, he's a workaholic.
I regret not having spent
more time with you,
but that was the nature
of my job.
It's consuming in terms
of how it can get inside you.
But we got a reward for that.
Well, the European flag.
The UEFA flag
flying over Pittodrie!
Bayern Munich versus Aberdeen.
Well, let's put it this way,
right?
Aberdeen and Bayern.
Bayern have got 70,000
in their stadium.
Aberdeen had 20, right?
Augenthaler,
looking for a chance to shoot.
And that's the moment
that Aberdeen were dreading.
When I look back at it
now, our training, the intensity,
he was testing us.
That's a great cross.
Eric Black is there!
It's off the line. No!
It's put in by Simpson!
And Aberdeen are level.
He didn't want
anybody next to him
that he knew would
let him or the team down...
in a crisis moment.
And that is a special goal,
which might well end
Aberdeen's challenge in Europe.
At two-one,
there was a crisis moment.
We needed two goals.
The header finds the net!
Can they make it?
There's Eric Black!
The goalkeeper knocks it out.
It's in the net,
and Aberdeen are in front!
Pittodrie goes berserk.
Well, that score line
is almost impossible to believe.
The final whistle goes, Aberdeen have
won, perhaps, their greatest victory ever!
Alec Ferguson dancing a jig of
delight on the track, and well he might.
That game was monumental to me.
I mean, God Almighty.
Real Madrid, in the
final of a European tournament.
Real Madrid are the most
successful club in the world.
For a small club in a small
town, this had made their lives.
Thousands
of Don's fans are travelling
to support their heroes'
first European final.
Light refreshments
were already
being served in the bar
and proving so popular
that reinforcements
were being brought in
by the trolley load.
What are you going to do
after the match?
Get drunk.
Celebrate.
- What happens if we lose?
- Still get drunk.

The pride of Scottish football,
Aberdeen,
received a huge welcome
as they returned home bearing
the European Cup, Winner's Cup.
Britain's most
northerly professional football club
has never seen
anything like this.
The greyness of the
Granite City was transformed.
The amazing response
has been from managers
and-and directors in England.
- In England?
- Yes.
Well, we have one here
from Bob Paisley of Liverpool,
which is marvelous, you know.
"Congratulations,
you've done us proud."
How difficult is it
to adjust to another cup final?
Well, it's just got
down to this stage now
that we don't want to
disappoint anyone.
Well, in fact,
the very last game you played
for Rangers was in
the Cup Final, was it not?
The last game of the year,
the Cup Final against Rangers,
is as good a time as any to demonstrate
who's the best team in Scotland.
That's a good ball.
McGhee likes his position.
It could be there. It is!
The winner!
That will win the Cup.
There's Alec Ferguson.
Okay. Alec Ferguson, many
congratulations winning the Scottish Cup
for the second year,
but it was close.
Were you surprised by the way...
Can you give a reason for
the disappointing performance, then?
I can't understand
why I did it.
The only thing I can
think of was that...
I wanted this to be the moment,
when we...
we set ourselves as the
best team Scotland ever had.
In all honesty, was it about
being the best team in Scotland?
Or was it about
hammering Rangers?
I think it was, probably,
about beating Rangers.
This was my moment to say,
"Right, you're gonna get it."
I wanted to
put the knife in them.
I think it was that, really.
I think that my dad...
was pointing at a totally
different target to-to other people.
I think he was already thinking,
"Look, my horizons
are beyond Aberdeen."
Beyond Rangers, beyond Scotland.
"I've beaten these guys. I've
totally different aspirations now."
My dad's an optimist.
He's an absolute clear optimist.
And so, you know,
he's willing to dream big.
Manchester
United sacked their manager,
Ron Atkinson today.
And the man
who's going to replace him
is Aberdeen's Alex Ferguson.
1986 has been United's
worst start to the season
since the war.
The camera
shutters and the microphones strained
at the first appearance
of the new boss.
Manchester
United is the most famous name
in English football.
There's no bigger news.
If there is a man,
is he the man to follow you?
Yes, I'd have to be honest.
If I'd have been the chairman
and I'd have got rid of somebody
like me, I'd have taken him.
Moving across the border
was, you know, going to the moon.
And I wasn't... I wasn't happy
because I didn't want to leave Aberdeen.
But I knew there was no way
he would refuse that job.
We've brought Alec
down from Scotland this morning.
Perhaps, we'd like to go
straight into the questions.
You've come here
with the club 19th in the First Division.
We need to look at
the facts for themselves.
We haven't won the League
for 20 years, right?
That is a great challenge for
the Manchester United players,
and will be until it's achieved.
And the only way we can win the
European Cup is by winning the League.
Because that's the great desire.
And my first day there,
I went to Old Trafford.
Even though
it was an empty stadium,
you can feel
the spirit of the place.
It's like a theatre
with ghosts walking about it.
Memories.
Matt Busby,
the maestro of Manchester United...
This is the place
where they've created...
Gods.
The manager, Matt
Busby, transformed the whole approach
to modern day football with
his commitment to a youth policy.
I have a scouting system
whose sole object is to go out
looking for young,
promising school boys,
youth club boys,
and indeed, any young players.
Manchester United
were supreme soccer champions of Europe!
Matt Busby doing what he did
to bring all these young
players into your first team,
this is what I believed in.
This is what I was good at.
This is what I wanted to do.
So, it was question time.
What do I really need
to resurrect the club?
One way of doing it
was the proper youth system.
That can be the spirit
of the place.
The new spirit.
I had a meeting with Brian
Whitehouse who was the reserve coach.
And a meeting
with Eric Harrison.
And they were
Ron Atkinson's men, of course.
They had a youth game. I think
it was second or third week there.
They were shocking Jason,
they were shocking.
I went in after the dressing
room, I couldn't stand it.
And I went berserk with them.
And I knew Eric was not pleased.
Eric was not pleased.
And he came to see me
the next day.
He says, "Look, that's my job.
I've never known a manager
to come in."
And I says, "Yeah, but you've
never known a manager like me."
The first thing he did, was we
got all the scouts together.
I'd only two scouts
in Manchester.
And he says, "We need to do
something about that."
So my job was to...
flood Manchester with scouts.
So as he could have his way
of building a football club,
from the bottom up.
We had to make a mark
on Manchester itself.
It was only a few weeks after I
arrived, and, um, there was a steward.
Says,
"Boss, there's a young lad."
He's training with Man City,
he's a United fan.
He's an absolutely
fantastic player,
"and we're doing nothing
about it."
So I went to see him.
I did notice him
while I was playing.
"The Man United manager,
what's going on there?"
It just doesn't happen.
It just doesn't happen.
You see him
dancing over the pitch.
You know...
Sensational.
Feet, very narrow.
Balance, fantastic.
We got him signed.
He was a breath of fresh air,
he really was.
So... he was the future.
But putting that aside,
you need results
in your first team.
But I knew that.
When you look round that squad,
it was just a dysfunctional unit.
"Fifth of March, 1988.
Lost 1-0 at Norwich.
Absolutely shocking display."
Manchester
United conspicuous by their absence.
"Sunday, had the players
in for a talk."
Manchester
United have won nothing since '85.
It's not good enough.
"Lost 1-0 to Liverpool.
Shocker of a game."
Alec Ferguson,
his team in severe problems.
"Lost 2-1.
Team is lacking confidence."
Did it affect
your confidence at all?
Lack of success
affects everyone's confidence.
Did you know the pressures
were going to be quite as great
when you left Scotland?
No. No. I didn't...
I didn't realise that.
"Lost two-nil to
Southampton. Totally disgusting."
A beleaguered manager.
"Sunday. Frustrated."
"Saturday, 23rd of
September. V Man City."
United
all over the place! Morley!
"Lost 5-1."
Alex Ferguson won three
championships with Aberdeen in Scotland.
But he's finding it
a far more difficult prize
to get his hands on
south of the border.
I remember after the game...
I got home.
I just stayed in my bed,
you know?
Probably the best place to be.
I'd been there
for over three years,
and that's when the cries
were coming out, you know?
Fergie out.
Fergie out! Fergie out!
Fergie out!
Fergie out! Fergie out!
We got calls into the house.
I remember that, yeah. I do.
You know, "Go back to
fucking Scotland," and all that.
"You're fucking useless."
I would just
put the phone down, you know.
And Cathy
got a bit upset with it.
You were getting
abusive phone calls.
I found that really hard.
It would have just been like
a tightening of a screw on her.
It was just
an instrument of torture.
I got sort of a, paranoid.
The magpies drove me crazy.
One for sorrow, two for joy, so if
you only saw one before a game,
I mean I-I used to be looking
for the other.
I went to him,
and so did my brothers,
and I just said,
"Dad, it's not working.
You're not going to
be able to succeed here.
You know, it's-it's...
You know, it's killing us,
and I just don't think
you're going to be successful."
And for his eldest son
to have basically gone and said,
"We don't believe in you. You're
going to fail. You need to give up,"
which is not quite what I said,
but it's what I meant.
And he said, "I really think I can
succeed here. I really think we're close."
And I was like, "Oh, deluded.
What are you thinking?"
"January 1st, good luck!
F.A. Cup."
For
Manchester United, Sunday's match
at Nottingham Forest
has been looming.
United are going to Forest
currently fifth bottom
of the First Division.
It's being
billed as Alex Ferguson's last stand.
His Alamo.
The day before,
Martin Edwards, the chairman,
called me up to his office.
And he says, "Doesn't matter
what happens on Sunday,
you'll still be the manager,
I can assure you of that."
And that was good of him
to do that.
Now, that's not to say,
that was cast in stone, that.
Because if the crowds
had gone down,
and we end up at the bottom
of the league, you're away.
I could half agree with the club if
they said, "Well, we've had enough."
Alec Ferguson, who
celebrated his 48th birthday last week.
And I suspect in the last seven
weeks, he's aged a bit more than that.
OÖrlygsson, kept in by Martin.
Hughes, he's got a lot of room.
And here's Robins!
United are through!
Some joy at last
for Alec Ferguson.
There's a smile on the face
of the United manager.
After so many problems, at least,
they've won this crunch-match.
That was a pivotal game.
And of course, we were
struggling in the league.
But now the F.A. Cup
was keeping us alive, you know.
Yes!
Manchester United are at Wembley.
We got to
the-the Cup Final.
But I had a
big problem in my mind.
Jim Leighton.
Jim was having a horrid time.
Long range shot...
Oh! A mistake
there by Jim Leighton.
Jim...
I gave him
his debut at Aberdeen.
I brought him to United.
Alex Ferguson
said he is the best goalkeeper in Britain.
At Aberdeen...
did well for me.
And once
again, Leighton is Aberdeen's hero!
Fantastic goalkeeper, Jim.
Top, top goalkeeper.
The fact that I'm supposed to
be the best goalkeeper in Scotland,
you get a lot more respect.
Plus, the confidence has done me
an awful lot of good as well.
But now...
He didn't seem to have the same
confidence about himself.
There's the man. Alex Ferguson.
Free kick to Crystal Palace.
Andy Gray's back
on his feet to take it.
Thorn, O'Reilly's in there!
And was it over the line?
And it's a goal!
He was making mistake
after mistake.
Wright! Goal!
And the referee has blown,
and the F.A. Cup Final of 1990
ends in a draw.
And they'll have to come back
and do it all again on Thursday.
But after the game,
Jim's like that.
Head was right down, right down.
It got to that point
that you say to yourself,
"I have to pick a team
that's going to win the Cup."
I don't think Jim's
part of my thinking in that.
So, we had a wee bit
of an argument about that.
He would've played him again,
Archie. He would've.
But he knew he was only doing it
through his loyalty to Jim.
I just said that, "Oh, well,
you know, that'll finish Big Jim."
When there's a doubt,
there's no doubt.
And I... I'd made my mind up.
I'd made my mind up.
I then went to Jim's room.
And I told him,
and he burst out crying.
So, the big
news is that Jim Leighton is dropped.
A major decision by Alex
Ferguson to drop a goalkeeper
who played in so many
Scottish Cup finals for him.
And on it may hinge
an awful lot of futures.
And Les Sealey
gets a surprise call-up.
Sealey was not
as good a goalkeeper.
But he thought he was, you know?
Pardew
closing in and so was Mark Bright.
And that's the first test
for Les Sealey.
And Les Sealey does well.
And it's Gray. Oh! Saved by
Sealey's legs! That's a good stop!
The goalkeeper
takes credit again.
Lee Martin, inspired run on the far
side. A chance here... and a goal!
Manchester United
have won the F.A. Cup!
Alex Ferguson's first
major trophy at Old Trafford.
And just look
at that man's face!
The years seem to have fallen
away there from Alex Ferguson,
after a season of torment
and tribulation.
Making big decisions
affecting players' careers...
is not easy.
He might have
called it ruthless.
Do you still feel
a Manchester United player?
I don't think...
They days are gone now.
- Really?
- I think so, yeah.
I think from both sides,
those days are gone now.
Never spoke to me again.
Yeah... so...
You lose a friend, or you lose
someone that you'd given
his first opportunity in life.
But make no mistake,
it was the correct decision.
- Want some water?
- I'm all right.
Okay.
I got home.
All the things that were
bottling up inside me...
it was a sort of,
uh, opening up.
You know, you just
want to spill it all out.
I don't know
if you want to kick off?
No, I think that, um...
It's been an experience.
I think that...
What I... what you realise is...
that what happens when you die,
is it... people suffer cancer,
and there's a long period
before they do.
But when it happens like that,
they say it's the best way to go.
But you don't remember anything.
When I collapsed
that Saturday morning,
and I had no idea from that
moment on, what-what happened.
People say that I was sitting up
talking in Macclesfield Hospital,
before I went to Royal Salford.
But I don't remember a thing.
So...
I'm not sure when the moment
comes and you do die,
whether it's the best way to go.
In the moments
when you're on your own,
there's that fear
and there's that loneliness.
That creeps
into your mind and...
you don't want to die. You
know, and that's where I was at.
I don't want to, I'm not
gonna die. I don't want to die.
These things did flash
through my mind quite a lot.
They had wanted him to go
to the first game
of the season at Old Trafford.
But Dr George says no,
it was too much, you know.
Far too much. And we said that
ourselves, you know.
'Cause everybody's going to be...
Cameras, everything, you know.
I have a slight concern about
going to watch United again
in terms of the first time.
A third of my life
has been at United,
creating a certain type
of football club.
But you're still walking into
a sort of, uh, an unknown...
situation for yourself.
Somewhere inside you,
you know, there's a doubt.
A long-term approach
always suited me,
to go the long road
to shape my future.
And number 14
is 17-year old Ryan Giggs.
Manchester United believe
we may be seeing the start
of a very special career
here this afternoon.
If you get them young enough,
and breed the important values
of what you're trying to
achieve with them,
they became that particular
person you were looking for.
Do you have to treat them, you know,
differently to-to the established stars?
Absolutely. You've got to be
real hard on them.
Because they're facing for
the first time in their lives...
- Harder on them?
- Oh, yes.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
They're facing for the first time
in their lives, media attention.
And you won't get the crit... you
don't get any criticism from journalism
to young boys. It's all praise.
- That's ahead.
- Do you sometimes feel like a bully?
No, no, no, no! I think they
realise that it's for their own good.
My Dad left when I was 14.
I had two mainstays in my life:
My grandad and the manager.
There was definitely
that father-son relationship.
Um, sometimes that was good,
sometimes that was bad because he
felt he could say whatever he wanted.
Um, which was tough to take,
especially when you're an 18, 19 year-old.
Honestly, sometimes, you know,
he would have fights with the
players, or nearly have fights.
I wanted to, because he
would be right in your face,
screaming at you.
To the outside world,
you've got this reputation...
as this fearsome character.
Yeah, absolutely.
That fearsome character
has been portrayed
throughout my career.
I mean... That's
the baggage I've had to carry.
Maybe times when you felt,
"Oh, went maybe
a bit too far there."
Oh, there'd be plenty times.
But...
I don't think there's anything
wrong with losing your temper
if it's for the right reasons,
you know?
Where they didn't reach
their expectation in a game,
because everything's
built around what we expect
in terms of the standard
of our training,
and the ambitions
of the football club.
Because my experience
of human beings...
they'd like to do things
the easiest way.
The minute you-you accept
a bad performance from them,
or a bad technical aspect
of their training,
they'll do it again.
I remember, against Juventus.
I spent the whole half, I mean,
which is what I did, dribbling, and yeah.
Conte was taking it off me. And
they were going on and attacking.
And I wasn't having a good game.
At half time,
and the manager
just went for me straight away.
"Stop dribbling in midfield."
And this argument started, and...
I've got these
blackcurrant drinks
that we used to have at
half-time, and I threw it.
Threw it right
at the gaffer's feet.
So Giggs is off.
He was always in control.
You were never in any doubt,
who was the boss.
Yeah, I could be.
I could be ferocious
in terms of my criticism
after games.
But sometimes
I never said a word to them.
Sometimes I would gather them
altogether,
and I never
made myself predictable.
But away from football,
he would sometimes spot
if there was something wrong.
"Is everything okay at home? You
know you can always talk to me."
That was comforting to me.
That was comforting to me
that no matter
how many arguments we have,
how many... if I wasn't
playing well, if he dropped me,
that I could always come
and talk about things.
Because then,
it wasn't about football.
It was about
how you are as a human being.
It wasn't as if
I was their best pal.
But they always knew I would
find a way to help them.
If you want to be
the proper manager,
and be in control of a unit
as big as that...
you have to know them all.
All these different people...
with all these
different stories.
I wasn't happy,
so I just reacted.
It wasn't really the football
I dreamed about.
Just lost that passion
for the game.
I always remember,
I'd gone to a game in Paris.
And I was sitting between
Michel Platini and Gerard Houllier.
And right out of the blue,
Michel says, "Why don't you
sign Eric Cantona?"
And I says, "Well, isn't there
a bit of baggage there?"
And Michel says,
"Look, he's a great lad.
He just needs to be understood."
Football. And
Manchester United have signed
the French international
striker, Eric Cantona.
You shocked
everybody with the signing.
He's got a fiery reputation.
A fiery Frenchman,
and with due respect,
a fiery Scot.
How's that relationship
going to develop?
I think that hopefully I've got
the experience to handle it.
It's maybe a new challenge
for me, too.
- Is it a gamble?
- No, I don't think it's a gamble.
When I met Eric,
I said to myself, "Right,
I'm going to forget his past.
I'm not going to mention any
of his behavior. It didn't matter."
What mattered to me was
what we could do in terms
of bringing him into our fold.
Like, a new kid, as if he was an
apprentice, or a newborn baby.
It was to give him
that opportunity to be himself.
In anything I do in my life,
if I don't feel free...
I become crazy.
He knew exactly what I needed,
psychologically.
More than a manager.
Somebody strong enough to deal
with any kind of personality.
He was just
treated differently.
Black tie do.
I walked in, my top button's undone,
manager's gone straight for me.
"Get your top button done!
You're representing Man United!"
Two minutes later,
I'm sulking in the corner.
"Flipping heck, he's just had
a go at me, again."
Um, Eric walks in
with a white linen suit
with white/red
Tiempo Nike trainers on.
So I am like, flipping rubbing
my hands. "What's he gonna say?"
So he goes over, shakes his
hand, and then turns to us and go,
"Lads, that's style."
But...
when... when they... somebody like Alex
Ferguson give you the freedom you need...
to express yourself,
you have to deserve it, yeah.
And you know how lucky you are
to have this freedom.
It's why I worked...
so hard and I tried everything.
Everything...
I could give my life to him.
He was, and is still
a great psychologist.
Psychology
is someone else's word.
I call it...
management.
Cantona's
looping header... And a goal!
Cantona. Oh, look at that pass!
Oh, that's brilliant!
It was like a dream for me.
That's the football
I dreamed about.
And the spirit around football
I dreamed about.
I think that was the first time of
my life I felt like it was my place.
That's my house.
And here's Giggs.
Over the goalkeeper. Cantona!
Eric came at the right time
to lift United.
Eric Cantona, who
was only 11 and a half months old
the last time Manchester United
won the title.
We are going to do it.
It is going to happen.
Bruce, yes! Unbelievable.
There's still a bit to be done,
but Alec Ferguson almost
celebrating the championship.
And he's going to
the right, away from the marker.
Ince! Yes? That's it!
Get in, you beauty kiddo!
Good evening from Old Trafford.
There hasn't been
a night here like this
for over a quarter of a century.
But once again, Manchester
United are the champions.
It's been a long, long wait
since those days
of Best and Law and Charlton.
It was unbelievable,
the relief.
It was tangible. That
frustration of 26 years had gone.
This was a club
that had come alive again.
The champions of England!
The ultimate accolade
for all players.
You could...
You could smell the roses.
You could smell the roses.
There's no question about that.
And, um,
it was non-stop after that.
Elkins header only
goes to Cantona. A glorious goal!
Manchester United
have won the double.
And now, the plan we had
was finally the foundation.
Oh, beautiful goal
from David Beckham!
And Alex Ferguson is delighted
that one of his youngsters
has restored
Manchester United's lead!
Alec Ferguson has done
something never previously achieved.
The Double-Double.
Winning was always based
on my own attitude to failure.
You have to treat losing
as part of the progress.
Throughout my life,
a defeat or a failure
sparked something inside you.
That I did something about it.
As human beings,
you have to understand
that adversity
is part of your life.
And when it happens...
you find yourself.
Watford won.
To Old Trafford then,
where Ian Dennis will be watching
Manchester United against Wolves.
And Manchester
United have made four changes...
The Club were going to make,
uh, a presentation to the fans
that I was back, you know.
And I think,
the dilemma I had in my own mind
was going in front of 75,000 fans.
I'm a bit nervous.
Well, not nervous, but you know.
Sort of a...
How do you put it?
Tense I don't know... maybe.
In the recovery part...
I was starting to get these
dreams and repeated messages.
Like a recorder.
I had this song,
kept going through my head.
All the time.
And then there was another one.
"And Beckham crosses,
and it's a goal,"
going through my head
every night.
I don't know why that is.
I can't explain that.
Maybe Barcelona.
You like my singing?
What's this?
You were supposed
to fill this in some time ago.
Statement of health?
Your full name.
Alexander Chapman Ferguson.
- Scottish.
- And proud of it!
Are you pregnant? No.
High blood pressure,
heart attack, angina pectoris
or any other disorder
of the heart or blood vessels?
No, but that's coming.
The way that team
of mine's playing the now.
That's it? Right.
1999.
We'd won the League again.
And we'd won the Cup again.
But to be honest,
it was all about Europe.
Keane!
Roy Keane with a captain's goal
for Manchester United!
Manchester United
are in the European Cup Final.
Full speed ahead Barcelona!
In my time at United,
my priority
was the European Cup,
the Champions League.
There was an anxiety in me.
I'd won all these trophies,
cups and leagues.
But not won the Holy Grail.
It's about a reward for
sticking to what you believed in.
This was the big one.
The mood was great.
The set-up was right.
Everything was right.
Game on!
Let's not forget however much
Manchester United
want to win this trophy back,
Bayern Munich
want it just as much.
They have the tradition, too.
They have the expectations, too.
And they have had to
wait a long time, too.
It's something
that I'd had on many occasions,
you know, that... that, um,
butterflies in the stomach.
You know, you want the game
to start right away.
Free kick
on the edge of the box.
Tense moment.
It's Basler!
Oh, first blood to Bayern Munich!
Mario Basler with
a little over five minutes gone.
And Manchester United have
made it hard for themselves.
Bayern are playing
very well, aren't they?
Very efficient.
They've got a game plan
they're playing at
and they're sticking at.
We were a wee bit
anxious looking.
We weren't making the chances
we would normally make.
It has not gone
Manchester United's way.
They were the better team.
Scholl. Looking for Jancker.
Looking to let the ball run.
Support. Stefan Effenberg. Oh!
It's still Basler
on the ball.
Scholl taking over.
Oh, delicious chip
hits the post.
You don't see that going
anywhere else but in the net.
More danger now.
Scholl's there with a header. Jancker
with the overhead. Hits the crossbar!
Twice the woodwork
has saved Manchester United.
Last four minutes.
They were big chances.
But... we survived.
The Beckhams, the Giggs',
the Scholes', the Butts, the Nevilles
were all brought up
with a mentality
that mirror you.
Where I came from...
stand up for themselves.
♪ We shall not be moved
And stand up for their team.
It's always been in me.
And I like to
see myself in my team.
To connect...
to that history...
of self-sacrifice,
the determination.
That working-class
feeling into people.
Together.
You didn't win them all.
But you stood up for yourself.
We're in the last
of the 90 minutes.
What we need now
is the fourth official
to hold a board up
with about 20 on it.
It had run away from us.
I started to think what I was
going to say to the players.
And the only thing I could
say is, they were great.
They'd had a fantastic season.
I was proud of them,
I really was.
It's gone against us this time,
you know.
And the fourth official
put the board up.
Three minutes.
Three added minutes.
Cross deflected,
out for a corner.
Can Manchester United score?
In towards Schmeichel.
It's come for Dwight Yorke.
Cleared. Giggs with a shot.
Sheringham!
Teddy Sheringham
with 30 seconds of added time played
has equalised
for Manchester United!
They are still in
the European Cup!
It was bedlam!
That's what it was,
it was bedlam.
And it was, uh, funny.
It was as if fate
had come along and says,
"It's your turn, Alec."
Extraordinary
climax at the Nou Camp Stadium!
Just hold it.
Calm.
Composure.
They've gone.
♪ We shall not be moved
Another corner.
Beckham in to
Sheringham. And Solskjaer has won it!
Manchester United
have reached the promised land!
I don't believe...
I don't believe it!
And when
it comes to the final bit...
I don't watch the game,
I watch the referee...
to see him putting
that whistle in his mouth.
The game's over.
The game was over.
God, we've done it.
Alex Ferguson, they
put you through the mill, into injury time.
Almost lost the cup, and you win
it. The new European Champions.
The treble.
The dream come true for you.
Oh, I can't believe it. I can't
believe it. Football, bloody hell.
But they never give in,
and that's what won it.
You start thinking,
where's Cathy?
I wonder where she is.
Cathy.
The period in the hospital,
I wrote letters, yeah.
I wrote down
what I wanted to say to Cathy.
That's right.
"I am proud of you, Cathy,
and your determination."
All your years,
you've shown great strength.
But my heart
should pray for life.
I don't give up.
I was weak and lonely
and miss you, your light.
My sons and you I'm proud of.
You brought up the way in
control and inspection in school.
"I wasn't able,
but I was too busy working."
Mm. Amazing that...
It's an abbreviation
of my life really.
It's maybe an apology really
for not always being there.
Uh, and I think...
I think that's what
the letter's about, really.
She is an amazing woman.
She really is
the catalyst of all.
She sacrificed to support me
one hundred percent.
Fifty-three years married,
you know.
That tells you a lot, really.
You know, there's a lot of
sacrifice comes into that. And, uh...
Um, a lot of patience
married to me.
1986 was the year
Alex Ferguson took over.
And now another landmark year.
Champions of Europe!
Champions of England!
Winners of the F.A. Cup!
Everything their hearts desired.
- Was this the greatest moment?
- Definitely.
Without doubt, it was my
greatest moment as a manager.
It's exactly epitomised
all my teams.
And I look back and...
say now that-that was,
uh, the spirit.
It was a spirit, and it was
there, right through to when I left.
That night...
it showed itself.
Showed all the qualities that
got you there in the first place.
They came out that night.
Never give in.
Absolutely brilliant.
That's my best ever.
You worry...
you'll lose all this history.
All these memories.
But they live on.
And they'll never be forgotten.
Old Trafford.
This afternoon we are honored
and delighted to welcome back
someone who has been part of

four League Cups,
ten Charity Community Shields,
one European Cup Winners' Cup,
one European Super Cup,
two Champions League titles,
Intercontinental Cup,
one FIFA Club World Cup,
and 13 Premier League titles!
The impossible
