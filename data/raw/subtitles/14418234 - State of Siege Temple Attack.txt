Hey! Stop here.
I'll take it from here.
Hey, you girl.
Come here. Come on.
Listen to me.
Come here.
What a creep you are.
Well, I can't deny that.
What are you looking at?
Come here.
Where were you last night?
Why didn't you come?
I was waiting for you.
Will you come tonight?
Hey, Sarfaraz!
Have some shame, buddy.
Listen to me.
Listen!
Enough now, creep.
Ismail! Ismail!
Ismail! Ismail!
-Yes, Sir.
-How is that lady doing?
She is fast asleep and snoring.
Let me tell you something,
all Indian women snore.
Even the minister's daughter?
That's the reason she is snoring
and is not worried about anything.
Cheetah one to Romeo, come in.
Cheetah one.
Strike team update your status.
In radio, Cheetah one. Pass.
It's confirmed that the target is here.
Affirmative. Hang back.
Strike team will be there in 18 minutes.
Stay alert, out.
Here, have some nuts.
Did you find the target, sir?
Strike team will be here in 18 minutes.
I lost, sir.
You guys know that gambling
is illegal, right?
And moreover, on targets--
-Ismail! Ismail!
-It's not like that, sir.
-Sir!
-Yes, sir.
Army has been spotted, moving towards you.
They will reach there
in about 15 minutes.
I will wake her up, boss!
Let her sleep!
Boss will decide her fate,
if she will stay alive or not.
-Stay alert. We'll be there.
-Okay, boss.
Sarfaraz, army is coming.
Cheetah one to Romeo, come in.
Urgent.
I repeat, it's urgent.
Pass your message, Cheetah one.
Sir, our strike team has been spotted.
I need permission to go in.
I feel our target is in danger.
Did they mention anything about
killing the target? Over.
No, sir.
Team will be there in 12 minutes.
Just wait.
Over and out.
Cheetah one to Romeo.
Sir, that will be too late.
I am going in, over, and out.
Cheetah one, negative.
I said, wait! Over.
Channel nine.
Bibek, you stay here, I am going in.
Romeo to Cheetah one, are you there?
Keep trying him.
Sir, shall we?
You never listen.
Just following your footsteps, sir.
Ismail!
Ismail!
Miss Noor…
Indian army. Let's go.
May God protect you.
Come.
Ismail!
Sarfaraz!
Where are you guys?
That's Abu Hamza.
And that's Bilal Naikoo with him.
Go, check upstairs.
Take her.
Cheetah two to Shera one,
Are you getting a clear shot?
I am getting a clear shot. Over.
Hold it.
We've to catch him alive.
Sir.
Sir.
Sir.
F***!
Boss, that lady has run away!
-What!
F***!
Boss!
Run!
Boss!
Come on! Run!
This way, boss!
This way...
-Bilal, this way!
This way, boss.
Clear!
Target is running left to right.
Distance is 500 meters.
-Acquired.
-Dispatch.
Sierra to Romeo, strike team on location.
One target is arrested.
Now, going to assist Cheetah one.
Hamza!
Don't fire.
Let me go.
Don't shoot me.
Just… don't shoot me.
Now, the mission is over.
Sir, you'll get me shot someday.
Boss, let's go.
Let's get away from here.
Let's go!
Let's talk about Gujarat now.
The whole country was shaken
by the Gujarat riots.
Those riots caused a lot of damage to
life and property.
But it is a matter of relief
that no violent incident
has been reported
for the last several months.
People have resumed their day-to-day life.
There's peace in Gujarat
and the entire country.
It's shameful for us
that there's peace in that country.
Good shot, Khan!
-Thank you!
Superb! Superb!
-Thanks!
Sir, you'll get me shot someday.
You lost your touch, Major Singh.
What were you saying, Captain Rohit?
Sir!
Sir, I was…
All that I heard about Major Singh...
Not everything you hear is true, Rohit.
Just Major Hanut lost a friend…
Captain Bibek was like his brother.
Colonel Nagar holds Major Singh
responsible for the mission's failure.
"Following the plan,
not to disobey orders"
is the first thing we learn, sir.
But he changed the plan.
Plan is the first casualty
in every mission, Rohit.
It's a high-risk game.
You win some, you lose some.
That day, Hanut followed his gut,
and it went wrong.
He has been paying for it ever since.
Yes, sir.
Farooq!
You've only one bullet for each target.
Not even a single bullet must get wasted!
We have to
kick all the infidels out of Kashmir.
The Almighty chose the four of you.
You're his army.
You're no less than a tank, a plane
or even a fighter jet
because He chose you for this job.
Now, it's your turn to attack India
so hard
that they never forget it.
-If God wills it!
-If God wills it!
-If God wills it!
-If God wills it!
Allah is the greatest.
March starts at 3:30 a.m.
-Everyone must do the bigger pit.
-Yes, sir!
Major, what's the ETA?
Excuse me.
Lata is overdue for two weeks.
I hope, it's a girl.
-Yeah.
By the way, where were you yesterday?
It's just… that I don't feel like it.
I don't feel like meeting people.
I understand.
Jai Hind, Sir.
G.C. sir has called for both of you.
Jai Hind, Sir.
Jai Hind.
Come in.
We've received the information
from headquarters
that Chief Minister Choksey's life
is in danger.
Something big is being planned in Gujarat.
Chief Minister Choksey
and many business leaders are going to be
a part of a business event
to be held in Ahmedabad in two days.
A juicy target for a terrorist.
I need a hit from CTTF-2, that will
accompany me to Gujarat, tomorrow.
Hence, I will need you both on this task.
Sir, Major Samar is expecting to become
a father by tomorrow.
Anyway, for this babysitting mission--
-This is not a babysitting mission, Singh!
It's our job.
You might have forgotten that,
but we remember.
Fine. Samar, you stay back.
Hanut, I need a team ready by 0600 hours.
That's all.
Officers!
Ticket!
Show me your tickets.
Here. It's for four of us.
Here you go.
Here's samosas, please have some.
Sir, there's police
at every access point of the hotel.
Every vehicle is being checked
before entering.
There is just one entrance
and no one unknown will be
given entry from there.
Sir, this is our library. We've converted
it to a command setup for you.
There's live footage coming in
from all the CCTVs.
You'll have complete support from our end.
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.
This is our base, gentlemen.
Khan, coordinate with the local police
for all the arrangements.
-Cross-check with me.
-Yes, sir.
Snipers, position yourself on the terrace.
-Rohit…
-Sir.
Set up the group communication line.
Radio jamming, cell surveillance,
everything! Okay?
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, sir.
Sir, it's your first mission.
How are you feeling?
What a waste, man.
I imagined my first mission
to have some action.
I don't miss my targets.
-So, it's your first mission?
-Yes, sir.
-All the best.
-Thank you, sir.
F***!
Let's go, Shaheen.
Be careful.
We will step out now.
Stay with your dad.
Let's go.
Be careful.
Have you reached?
-Yes, we have.
There's a white ambassador with a driver
outside the station, waiting for you.
That's for you.
-Okay.
Ladies and Gentlemen…
No… This "Ladies and gentlemen"
is very old-fashioned. Let's--
"Associates" will be fine.
"Associates, industries are
the fuel to any state."
"And our state--"
Colonel Nagar, please come.
-Jai Hind, Sir.
-Jai Hind. I…
-I heard that you'll be here.
-Yes, sir.
I'll be handling the security here.
He is Major Hanut Singh.
He is the in-charge of
our house intervention team.
What! Your preparation is done, right?
Yes, I'll be there.
Okay. I'll see you.
-It's her birthday today, so we came.
-All right.
-Yes.
-Our son-in-law will come as well.
-Namaste.
-Namaste.
Swamiji, I will take your leave.
I've to leave for the conference.
-Just a minute. Please excuse me.
-Sure.
Mr. Vishal, what is this conference about?
For the state progress.
It's Mr. Choksey's dream.
If our Gujarat state progresses
then it's great.
Swamiji, Mr. Choksey is about to reach.
I will take your leave.
-All the best, dear.
I'll see you.
-Yeah.
Kids, greet Swamiji.
Namaste, Swamiji.
Namaste.
-Come on, speed up.
-Namaste.
-Come this way. Here.
Please standstill.
Go ahead.
-Namaste.
-Namaste.
Turn around.
Chintu! Where are you?
You're on your phone the entire day.
What are you doing here?
I'll work if there's work.
What do I do when there's no customer?
Come in and get to work.
-Namaste.
-Namaste.
Chintu, come on.
Dad, there's a customer.
I'll be back.
So, Angela…
-Yeah.
You think you'll find your answers here?
Of course, I will.
That's my journey.
I travel to new places.
I meet new people.
And the answer will come.
How is this?
That's nice.
I love the colour.
Madam, excuse me.
I am a professional guide.
I will take you inside the temple
and tell you everything about it.
My rate is Rs. 2000
but I will give a discounted price.
-Only Rs. 1000 and--
-No… that's too much.
Rs. 200 is enough.
Hey! Are you Gujarati?
Yes, I am from Ahmedabad.
And she is my friend, Angela.
She has come from Greece to see temples.
All the way from Greece?
-Yes.
Okay, let's finalise at 500 rupees?
No… nothing more than 200.
Okay, let's meet on the middle ground
and finalise at 300. Okay?
Okay, fine.
We will come back to you.
-Nice.
-Give it back to him.
-We'll come back.
-Thank you.
I know English also, madam.
I can show you the full temple
with every detail.
It will be mixed with Gujarati,
but I can explain.
Okay.
This is the world-famous Krishna Dham temple.
-There's a huge exhibition hall inside.
-Okay.
There is also an auditorium
that can accommodate 200 people.
-Good afternoon, Lata.
-Good afternoon.
-Hello, Major Samar. How are you?
-Fine.
All well?
Everything seems okay.
Your blood pressure is also fine.
We'll have some final tests done
before the surgery.
-Okay?
-Okay, doctor.
It's a standard procedure.
Don't worry.
-Okay.
-Take care.
See you.
Everything is fine.
How long will it take?
We're about to reach.
Drive us to the right gate.
There's only one gate.
Come, Rupal.
-Pawan, hurry up! Mom-Dad must be waiting.
-Yes, let's go.
Let's go.
Where are your daughter
and her husband?
They're late even on your birthday.
They'll be here anytime now.
They might've gotten late
as Rupal comes late from school.
It's not crowded today.
We've to meet them in the auditorium, right?
-No, in the temple.
Come.
-Pawan.
-Tell me.
We forgot the camera in the car.
How will we click pictures now?
Don't worry. It's alright.
I will quickly go and get it.
Take the keys.
Thank you.
-Come back quickly.
-Yeah.
Come on.
-Go ahead.
-Rupal, go there.
Raise your hands.
Rajshree, please cover for me.
I'll go use the restroom.
-Come on.
-Stop, Rupal.
Are they talking about the history of India?
-Thank you.
Come.
-I just love it. Come.
Madam, inside you, will a beautiful light
and sound show.
Did you come here for the first time?
-I've been here before. I came with her.
-Okay.
It's a world-famous temple.
Do you know the Shakuntla story?
She was a very beautiful queen.
-She got married to King Dushyant.
-Dhushant?
It's Dushyant.
-It's Dushyant.
-And their son was named, Bharat.
Everyone, settle down! Abhishek, sit down!
You sit at the back.
Don't fight.
What's the time?
It's 4:00.
-They should've been here by now.
-They'll come.
Next.
What's in the bag?
Open it.
Keep everything ready--
What's happening?
Why everyone's running here and there?
-There's firing. Let's go, Swamiji.
-Firing?
Allah is the greatest!
We're under attack!
Run!
Run! We're under attack!
Stop! Wait.
Not this way.
Come with me.
Come on, this way.
Swamiji! Get inside.
We're under attack.
There's firing, Swamiji.
Oh, God!
-India has been named after his name.
-What's that?
That's a peace symbol.
It signifies that India is peaceful.
Come on.
Hide there.
This way!
Run! Come on, run!
Sejal!
Hello, police station?
I am calling from the temple.
Everyone, run!
There's firing outside!
Run! Run!

Let's hide.
Come on.
Don't cry. Keep quiet!
Kill the lights.
Oh, God!
-Omar!
-Tell me!
-Find them and kill them all.
-Okay, brother.
You look in the basement
and I will look here.
Don't spare anyone.
Kill them on the spot.
Don't worry, brother.
We won't spare anyone!
Dear, listen to me carefully.
Don't worry.
Cover your eyes.
Keep your eyes closed.
And promise me that you'll not
open your eyes.
Just keep your eyes closed.
Daddy loves you, dear.
Daddy loves you.
-Daddy loves you.
-Look at him.
-Don't kill me, please.

Good job!
Keep looking for them.

-There's another one!
-Don't kill me! Please don't shoot me!
-Stop running!
Stop running, asshole!
Yes, boss.
Okay, as you say.
Farooq!
That's enough!
Boss has asked us
to keep them as hostages.
Be careful with the bullets.
Farooq! Omar!
-Go and handle the auditorium.
-Okay.
Hanif, let's go to the exhibition.
Guys…
May God protect you.
-May God protect you.
-May God protect you.
-May God protect you.
-May God protect you.
-May God protect you.
Listen! Gather as many hostages
as you can.
As you say.
Associates, industries are
the fuel to any state.
And standing on this stage,
when I see you all…
I feel so happy that I--
-What's happening?
-Sir, you'll have to come with us.
Stay with me, sir.
Moving!
Hey!
-Move!
-Move aside!
Major, what's happening?
-We need to isolate you, Sir.
-Why?
Krishnadham has been attacked.
NSG has been activated.
What about the people who were
inside the temple?
Hello, Dad.
-Chintu, where are you?
Dad, what's happening?
I don't know. There's firing.
Where are you?
I am here in the exhibition,
where the light show happens.
Don't you worry. Just stay calm.
You've to come out alive.
Don't do any stupidity.
No need to take any risk.
Did you understand, Chintu?
Chintu!
Dad, the terrorists are here.
Hey, come here.
Please don't shoot.
-I will call you back.
-I am at the shop.
Call me anytime.
I will be here.
Take care, dad.
I will call you later.
Chintu.
You're fine. You're going to be just fine.
You're fine, really.
Calm down.
Hello.
Hello…
Hello.
-Omar!

-What about the kids?
-They'll be fine.
It's fun!
FAITH
All of you, assemble at the front.
Hey you, come on.
Come out, motherf*****!
-Please don't shoot me!
Go there!
Come on!
Do as I say, or I will shoot.

OFFICE
-Who is it?
-Headquarters.
Yes.
Okay.
When do you need to leave?
Right now.
Go.
Sejal.
Sejal.
Please let us go.
Please let us go.
She'll die!
Farooq! Omar!
How many people are there?
There are 23 people.
Okay.
We're about to begin the second phase
of our mission.
Shoot one person, every half an hour.
You'll be the first one.
Then, you, after half an hour.
Then, you. You, after him.
And then, you.
You've to remember the sequence.
Otherwise, I will shoot you!
Farooq, you know what's to be done, right?
Yes, I know.
You were first, right?
Come on.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Why are you still sitting here?
Please, don't kill me!
What's your name?
I asked…
your name!
Vijay.
You've such a heroic name.
You must tell it with pride.
Okay, forget it.
Come, let's go.
Walk straight and walk fast.
Just do as I say.
Don't worry.
Be brave.
Keep walking.
Brother…
-Brother…
-If you call me brother again…
I will kill you right here.
I just got a job. I am about to
go to the US.
I just came here to thank God,
as I got my visa.
Keep walking!
Quick!
Walk fast!
Come on, asshole!
There's no one to take care of my parents.
This way.
Go there! Do as I say, f*****!
-Don't...
-I...
-Go!
It's Vijay's day today.
-Greetings, Boss.
-Greetings.
Did the second phase of our mission begin?
I'll be on line.
I want to hear it.
Okay, boss.
Hero.
Go that side.
Come on. Go.
Look down.
Please don't kill me!
Please don't kill me.
Announce your name!
It's Vijay Mehta.
I asked you to tell it to them,
not to me.
My name is…
Vijay Mehta.
Please…
Please inform my parents...
-They shot him!
-They shot him!
Listen to me carefully.
I have a message for your prime minister.
Okay.
Okay, sir. Thank you.
It was the prime minister.
Terrorists have sent their demands.
Who is it?
Abu Hamza.
He wants us to release Bilal Naikoo!
As soon as Naikoo is released
and crosses the border
they will let go of the hostages
and all the terrorists will surrender.
But till then, they will kill one hostage
every half an hour.
And they've already started.
They're lying.
Singh!
-No, Colonel.
Let him speak.
The moment Bilal Naikoo…
crosses the border
they will start killing people.
They won't spare anyone.
And…
they would have succeeded in making this
a huge embarrassment for India.
Let the central government
take a decision.
But we've to think about the safety
of the hostages.
Colonel, what's the ground strategy?
Rapid Action Force and police
have reached there.
Till the time NSG reaches there,
they will handle the situation there.
Sir!
CTTF-2 will take another four hours
to reach there.
So, what's your point, Singh?
Sir, my point is…
that it will not stop them
from killing people.
The police and Rapid Action Force has no
experience dealing with such a situation.
NSG must engage.
Because it will be impossible for us to
save the hostages after the release
of Bilal Naikoo.
My team captured Bilal Naikoo.
Let me go in.
Let me go in now, sir.
Colonel…
let him go.
At this moment, the hostages need
protection more than I do.
Okay. Take half the team.
But only stay at the perimeter. Okay?
Mr. Choksey, you called me?
Mr. Vishal is one of the trustees
at the temple.
Nobody understands the temple's layout
better than him.
Follow me, sir.
You two, with me.
What happened, Omar?
Why is everyone silent?
Did I miss something?
Did anyone die?
Come on, tell me.
Hey!
Can you sing…
some good songs?
What do you sing in school every morning?
Morning… morning prayer.
Okay. Go ahead, start singing.
Brother…
-Hold on, man! Hold on.
Come on, sing.
I said, start sing!
♪ Prayer song ♪
There's just one entrance.
Here's the exhibition hall
and the auditorium is on that side.
Hurry up, boys!
Be quick!
Make it quick!
Fast, guys!
Neither the prime minister
nor the chief minister Gujarat
has issued any statement
about the situation.
Quiet!
Another half an hour!
-No. Please, no.
-Let's go.
Please don't kill him.
Please don't take him.
Take me instead. Let him be.
Take me. Please, don't take him.
Don't take him, please.
It's good that they were late.
-Hey, come on!
-Hold on. Please…
-I am going.
-Don't stop! Go now!
-Please, stop.
-Just a minute…
-Stay back!
-I am going.
-Please stop. Don't go.
-Hey! Don't you dare to move.
Come on.
Don't move.
Greetings, boss.
Don't you stop or I will
kill you right here.
Boys, we've succeeded.
They've agreed to fulfill all our demands.
-All praise be to God.
-All praise be to God.
Brother…
We've won.
All praise be to God.
Get lost!
May God bless you, son.
May God bless you, son.
Why did you kill him?
Why did you kill him, scoundrel?
What did you get by killing him?
Brother!
Don't you want to celebrate
our victory?
Also, half an hour is over.
Is there someone you know inside?
My husband, my daughter, and my parents,
they're all inside the premises.
It's my mother's birthday today.
Don't kill me! Let me go!
Don't kill me!
Please don't kill me!
Now, the mission is over!
Sir, you'll get me shot someday.
Yes, sir.
The prime minister has agreed
to their demands.
Where did you reach?
Sir, ETA two minutes.
Okay.
Come on!
Quick!
Push it together!
Ready?
Hit!
Hit, again!
Let's go once more!
Naikoo, you're being released.
Fuck!
They received our welcome gift.
Please stay in the car.
Get the stretcher!
Stay down!
Quick!
That side!
Come on, help me get them out!
Careful.
Ambulance is here.
Come on!
You'll be fine.
Sir, blast!
Sir, there was a bomb planted
at the main gate.
Chintu, commandos are here.
They've black uniform and NSG is written
at the back.
Don't worry, they will save you.
Commandos in black uniform?
Chintu… Chintu?
Who are you?
Where is Chintu?
Who is Chintu?
He is alive.
He is right in front of me.
Who are you?
-Let me speak to Chintu.
-I asked you, who are you?
I am his father.
How do you know
that commandos are here?
They're in front of me.
I am hiding inside a sweet shop
opposite to the temple.
You love your son, don't you?
Yes, I do.
Then keep informing me whatever
you see or listen.
No… I can't do it.
Chintu!
We didn't kill him this time
but next time, we will.
No… you…
I will tell you everything.
You can call me.
Just don't kill my son, Chintu!
Okay, I swear on God…
your son will stay alive.
Stay alert, boys!
NSG is here.
-Got it?
-Yes.
Wait here. I will go and check.
Anyway, I am bored of their singing.
It's fun to kill a soldier.
Brother, don't--
Brother!
They've entered the premises, brother.
Why did you go out, Farooq?
Brother, I asked him to go out…
to keep an eye.
Fine. But just keep an eye.
Don't engage with them.
Got it?
Desai, go.
Come here, quick!
I've him right in front of me,
allow me to shoot him!
I said, don't engage!
Stay put.
If they make a move towards us,
keep me informed. Got it?
F***!
Sir…
Wait! Stay there!
Rohit, your 10 O'clock. Go!
Motherf*****...
What happened, Farooq?
They started firing, brother.
So, I had to fire back at them.
Go back to your position, Farooq!
We can't afford to risk our mission.
Okay, brother.
Hanif!
Khan, go!
Allah is the greatest!
Go! Go!
Rupal!
Sorry, sir.
So, you're here!
Now, nobody can save you from my bullet!
Motherf******!
Come on! Step forward.
Come on!
I will kick your ass!
I will kill you all!
Come on!
It still had the pin, idiot!
Keep quiet!
Brother Farooq?
Bro… brother Farooq!
Are you there?
Brother Farooq?
Are you there?
Why aren't you answering?
Far… Farooq!
Motherf*****--
Motherf*****!
Your comrade did the same mistake!
He died a miserable death!
F*****!
Farooq!
That's what his name was, right?
He died!
And now, it's your turn!
You want to play a game, right?
Okay, let's play!
I will make the rules!
Come on! Get up!
Come on, fire now!
Fire!
Come on!
If you shoot, she will die!
Why don't you shoot now?
You wanted to play a game, right?
So, let's play now!
Come on, shoot!
What happened?
Where is your bravado now?
Why don't you shoot now?
Come on! Shoot now!
Sierra one, inform Zulu one.
Two targets neutralised. Over.
-Greetings, Abu.
-Greetings, Bilal.
They're releasing me.
I will see you very soon.
I will be waiting for you.
Take care.
First group moving.
Provide cover.
Stay quiet!
Everyone stay quiet.
First group coming towards the entry gate.
Everyone, follow me.
Greetings, boss.
-Greetings, my boy.
Bilal has been released.
He is on his way.
-All praise be to God!
Boss, Farooq, and Omar are killed.
May God bless their souls.
It's time to show them
the power of our jihad.
Farooq and Omar have done their job
and are on their way to heaven.
Now, it's your and Hanif's turn.
Boss, NSG is here.
This was bound to happen.
Now, everything depends on whether or not
you both will be able to
stop them till Bilal reaches here.
Failure is not an option anymore, boss.
We will do whatever you ask us to do.
Don't worry.
Brother Bilal will return.
Our mission will be successful.
-All praise be to God.
Hey, you! Get up!
Let's go to the doctor.
Get up, let me take you to the doctor.
Come on.
Let's go.
-Thank you.
Thank you!
All will be fine,
just hold on for a bit.
It's alright. We're almost done.
You'll reach your home soon.
Everything will be fine.
Go! Go!
What is happening outside?
Move back!
Sir!
-How many people are in there?
-Five.
Quickly get out of here! Fast!
-Let's go. Fast!
Swamiji, please go.
-Come on, let's go.
Let's go.
-You guys go.
Come on, let's go.
Quick!
They will help you. Go.
They will take you to the doctor.
No!
F******!
Where is Sejal?
Have some tamarind, it will save you
from getting thirsty.
Where is Sejal?
The blast…
That was her, wasn't it?
Stay quiet or I will kill you.
I am not afraid of you!
You're an animal!
I am an animal, is it?
Have you seen yourself?
You, bloody foreigners…
are the cruelest of animals!
Delta 6 to Zulu 1, captain Khan is stable.
Shrapnel wounds with third-degree burns!
Medical evacuation in process.
Initially, all we know was
that four people
entered the temple premises
with assault rifles and explosives.
Apart from the shootout, 
two more blasts took place.
The first one was at the
temple's main gate and
and another one took place
inside the temple complex.
NSG's team is finally here.
We're expecting the situation
to get under control.
Although, there are no positive signs
as of yet.
Mom!
CTTF-2 is getting ready for the operation.
Over and out.
What are the chances
of Khan staying alive?
He is critical.
Can't say anything.
We'll have to take you
to the hospital, sir.
I am okay, doctor.
Hello, Mr. Papa.
Not yet, but I will be, anytime.
Is everything alright?
There's a small complication.
But you know Lata,
she will handle it.
Good.
How's Rohit?
A little shaken up.
Relieve him for today.
I will be ready to go, once this is done.
Sorry, Hanut.
You're also relieved.
-Major Singh.
-Sir.
Why did you relieve me from the unit?
Excuse me, sir.
Because you're not worthy of this team.
You disobeyed my order, again!
They started firing.
They did it,
because you entered the complex.
I told you not to,
but you did it anyway!
I had to evacuate the injured, sir.
-I did not have a choice.
-Yes, you did.
You always have a choice.
Sir, people were dying.
Now, numbers will increase…
just because of you!
You compromised the mission!
You are relieved till my next order!
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Sir…
I misunderstood you, sir.
Today, I learnt that there's
a huge difference between…
showing bravado in front of your brigade
and being on an actual mission.
What happened with Khan today…
that's really shaken me up, sir.
You don't have to explain it to me,
I've felt it.
You know what?
Even today, Bibek...
Trust your training, soldier!
We will enter from here.
-Yes, sir.
I will lead.
Buddy, don't lose your calm.
We've to keep him alive.
If we stick to our plan,
everything will be fine.
-Yes, sir.
-Got it, sir.
Let's go.
I am sorry, Hanut.
PATEL TEMPLE STORE
DAVE HANDICRAFT
GUJRAT POLICE
Hello!
Commanders are preparing for rope.
Major Samar climbing the rope.
Commando down!
Commando down!
There is firing from the other side!
Tango to Romeo, ambush…
They knew we were coming!
I shot one terrorist!
There is firing on the terrace!
There is firing on the terrace!
Motherf*****!
Firing on the rooftop!
Grenade blast!
Firing on the rooftop!
There's a grenade blast!
Major Samar, come in!
Major Samar! Major Samar, come in!
F***!
There's a mole!
-Hello.
-You're doing a great job.
I hope you won't harm my Chintu now.
Now that I swore on the Almighty,
I'll have to keep him alive.
Just keep me posted.
-Okay.
I have my eyes on the NSG.
Ambushed?
Can you reach Samar?
Negative, Colonel!
Okay. I am on my way.
Colonel…
I'll join you.
Let's go.
Nobody can harm either of us
till we complete our mission.
God is protecting us.
God protects each and everyone…
even the people you shot.
Hands up!
I said, hands up!
How did you reach here?
Brother, I could've run away
if I wanted to.
But Allah wanted me to come here.
What's your name?
Mou… Mousin.
You're one of us.
Yes, I am Muslim,
but I am not one of you.
I walk on the path shown by the Almighty.
I don't kill anyone.
Neither do I consider it as my jihad.
Do you believe in Allah or not?
You're living with these infidels
and serving their Bhagwan.
Brother…
whether it's Allah or Bhagwan--
While serving this temple, I learnt
that they also visit their temples
for the same reason, we visit our mosques…
To pray for their loved ones
and their well-being.
Try looking at them with
humanity point of view.
You'll know that we're all the same.
It's not about being right or wrong,
but about being different.
And they are different.
Different?
I hate everything that is different.
Being with these infidels,
you've become one of them, different.
Hey, you! Idiot!
Idiot, don't do any stupidity!
They will kill you.
Listen to me!
They will kill me anyway.
Tango three! Tango three, come in.
You've betrayed the nation.
I didn't have any choice, sir.
They'd have killed Chintu.
So you think, they will not kill him now?
Please don't say that, sir.
Please save my son, Chintu.
Please save him.
Update?
-One commando fatal, sir.
Contanct lost with Major Samar.
Did you try calling him?
Yes, sir. He is not reachable.
Sir…
We just have one last chance
to save Samar and the hostages.
Send me back in.
I can do this.
How will you do it?
Samar.
I love you, Lata.
Tell our baby that her dad loves...
Why don't you say it yourself…
to our daughter?
She weighs eight pounds.
She has a million-dollar smile.
She is beautiful.
Hello…
Hello!
Samar?
Hello!
As you've killed two commandos
they are giving up
and stepping back.
They won't attack you anymore.
Okay, Singh.
Now it's all on you. Are you ready?
Victory to courage, sir.
Victory to courage.
Hanif, they've given up.
They won't attack us anymore.
Glory to God.
Motherf*****! I will start shooting
if anyone moves from their place.
Stop running!
Don't you dare move!
-Chintu! Chintu!
-Harilal!
-Don't shoot!
-No, dad! Go back! Don't come here.
-You swore on God.
-Dad!
Don't shoot.
Dad…
Dad… Dad!
Hanif, go to the terrace.
You and me, okay?
-Yes, sir.
Let's go.
Go to the terrace! Go!
Yes, sir.
Bilal is about to cross the border.
You know what is to be done
after that, right?
Yes, boss.
You f*****!
Start walking.
Tell me, boss.
I will do it right away.
Allah is the greatest.
It's your turn.
So, Mr. Turban, I am off to my home.
But don't you worry. I will come back.
I'll be back to spread terror
in your country.
We will make sure that your nation
is being laughed at throughout the world.
F*****!
A******!
It's done. You're almost done.
You're there…
You're almost there!
Time to die!
Sir, you'll get me shot someday.
Zulu 1, all targets neutralised.
Stop Naikoo from crossing the border!
-Yes, sir.
Stop Naikoo!
Affirmative, sir!
Stop right there, Naikoo!
I said, stop walking, Naikoo!
Stop walking!
Naikoo, stop walking or I will shoot you!
Stop, Naikoo!
Motherf*****, I told you to stop!
Bilal!
Bilal… Bilal!
-Stay inside.
Start firing!
Bloody infidels!
F******!
What happened?
Sir, Naikoo has been delivered…
straight to hell.
-Long live…
-Mother India!
Affirmative. All threats neutralised.
You can sleep now.
Take it away.
I am fine. These are
just some small scratches.
You're praying
for the wrong people, Swamiji.
Love answers hatred…
non-violence for the violence.
The whole world needs to understand
that violence can never answer
any of your questions
it can only be the cause for
many questions.
Violence destabilises
the balance of society.
It can only spread hatred.
It might just be a matter of a few hours
but it haunts you for years.
It leaves you with sorrow and despair.
This kind of savagery needs to stop
or the whole world
will struggle because of this.
