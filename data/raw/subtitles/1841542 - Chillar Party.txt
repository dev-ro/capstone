Poor Parents!
They keep their childs names,
and friends gave them nick names.
With life time guarantee.
Mr. And Mrs. Ayer,
they couldn't finalize their child's
name after the great 4 years war.
Child's name?
Roni!
Roni!
And when grandpa has said
that's final.
But he didn't know,
that Ramashankar will become a left
arm fast bowler.
And we will give him nick name,
Akram!
Aunty! Akram's home,
Stop!
What Akram?
L am warning you if you will call him
Akram, l won't send him for play.
He is the left arm fast bowler
that's why they call him Akram,
Call him any lndian fast bowler name,
We don't have any shortage of
hindu left arm fast bowler.
L will teach him to ball from
his right hand,
His name was kept in emotions,
When l was born my father was
very happy,
and he gave me a name
Happy Singh,
When my son born,
so l got promotion,
then tell me what should l call him,
Tell me it's a simple question,
Promotion Singh,
Lucky Singh,
And whatever this lucky singh said,
that went always wrong,
Today lndia will must win,
We shouldn't watch match with him,
Why everyone calls you jinx?
L think l am jinx,
His tragedy was that...
he always got small and used clothes
by his elder brother,
lt's like new,
We just bought it last year.
Come on lt's school time,
That's why he has decided that one day
he will must buy new clothes.
So we couldn't call him
Second Hand,
And he is the filmy son of
DVD Librarian,
He really don't like to wear
underwear.
Tell me one thing,
Why don't you wear underwear?
Lt's my style.
Hrithik, Shahrukh, Salman
nobody wears underwear,
He got a nick name,
Jhangia! Bring some water.
His parents send him to every class.
And he doesn't say anything,
that's why he got a nick name...
Silencer!
He looks like chinese was
born in lndia.
His name is Shaolin,
And this is me... the master
mind of my team,
Our team also got a nick name.
Chillar Party!
Go away from here.
We had only two enemies.
One! Our neighbourhood over sized
cricket team,
from whom we were tired to
lose the matches.
Win someday
You always lose the match,
Whenever we will win l will must
crack a cracker on his head,
And our other enemy was...
not this one,
She always pee on our cricket pitch,
that's why we also hated dogs.
Lf some other dog will come to
our colony...
then we have to quit cricket,
Another dog in our colony,
He can't come,
How many times we told you don't
forecast anything,
What are you looking inside?
And what we were afraid of?
That happened,
What's your name?
Phatka!
And who is it?
He is a friend of mine.
He could clean all these cars?
Yes he could.
Just discuss his salary,
l don't want any complains,
Mind your own business and don't
interfere with anyone,
All society people are very nice only
secretary is strict,
But where will you stay?
That evening we got an urgent meeting,
We have to collect all information
regarding our new trouble.
Because information first
then we will take action,
Remember your tasks.
He ruined the entire game,
lt's useless to ask him,
He also talk to his dog.
Like Jackie shroff used to talk his dog
in the movie.
We will have to do something,
Let's talk to dog.
Swear to mom,
l told you that he talks to his dog.
We will have to attack on our enemy's
business to make him weak,
Where you taking the flour?
Teacher gave me the homework.
Now teachers will teach our childs
to cook,
Learn it,
that will help you later.
Take some vegetables.
But what we will make from this flour?
What are you doing?
Move your hand, don't touch,
l said through it away from the car,
Everyday some new problem,
Don't know what kind of problem
people have from us,
l just kept my clothes here,
He is a tough guy,
We are not less,
lf someone didn't do anything wrong
with me,
and l am bothering him,
then l am not a bad boy,
lf you are feeling bad after
doing this,
Now his weak body will get glucose
and carbohydrates,
You are so techincal sometimes
show some emotions,
Where are you going?
For combine studies,
l have lot of study pressure,
Amazing! My son has really
grown up,
What is the strategy of
tomorrow's match.
First find out where is the captain
of our team?
Here he comes!
Hi,
Sorry! L forgot to finish my
homework,
Our Akram is injured here,
and Shoaib Akhter is also injured,
He blow up our 5 wickets in last
match, and my head too...
We have another fast bowler
in our colony,
Bring that dog guy,
You are asking me why like you
don't know,
We need a fast bowler.
Our team need a fast bowler.
So shall l dance,
lt's a matter of our colony's respect
and he's also a part of this colony,
Tell me again, l forgot,
Fine!
Say sorry,
Tell them to sorry,
l'm appologizing from their behalf,
Where is Shoaib?
Everyone played very well today,
But only one player can get
man of the match,
Jhangia!
Me?
Have you gone mad?
Look at me,
l eat something when l got,
otherwise l sleep hungry,
l don't need any problem,
Nobody should stop me
like my parents,
Your mom gave you good food,
She tolerate your attitude,
Your father works all day long,
that's why you are in good school.
You wear nice clothes,
When you become ill.
Your parents take care of you
all night long,
Nobody is with me to love
and to get angry on me,
Our colony's name is Chandar Nagar,
and many people calls Cartoon Nagar,
because this colony is filled
with full of cartoons,
Your fingers should be parallel.
How long run up you will take.
She think her self heroine that's
why she don't talk to us,
He is Gugly,
What's the matter? Today entire
team is sitting together,
But nobody gives job to this
lady voice.
How is Phatka?
We didn't learn anything good,
and we became bad boy with him,
You should take your dinner
with that bad boy,
l am so tired,
Who will tell me about Mr. Gandhi?
Don't say goodnight like this,
then how to say,
Tell good night to your father,
Don't say good night like this,
lf you will go to meet Phatka then
you will get many slaps,
then we will meet tomorrow,
Please!
You don't need to go anywhere,
Stay here,
He have a fever,
He don't have fever but you have,
to wander around the colony,
Get inside,
l have a cerfew in my house,
Mine too,
Everyone is already angry.
And he won't wash a car,
He will lose his job,
Listen!
Do you have an alarm clock?
At 5:45 Cuckckcoo coo uncle comes
into his balcony,
Before he comes we have to
finish this job,
We also saw...
Who were gone to watch movie
with Mr. Sherma's maid,
Now did you see something,
No!
We also didn't see anything,
You have fight with Chillar Party,
Their parents makes some trouble.
What do they say? They says don't
play with a bad boy like me,
Me and Veeru don't care,
He knows l am a good guy,
l wish my interview takers should
think the same,
May l tell you one thing,
Hope you won't mind,
Your audio and video doesn't match,
lf only your voice can hear than
yourjob could be done,
Who knows either he is a guy
or girl?
We all are in life...
sometimes...
have mistaken to indetify the person,
Like people didn't recognize me,
And we all...
didn't recognize him,
He looks some kind of bad boy,
but it's a result of his advice,
that l have become something,
First l was invited to innograte
the bridges,
Nowdays l have been invited to
innograte Children's park,
Does anyone there to welcome me,
or some cheer up people.
He is Mr. Sherma!
The mentenance incharge of garden,
Whose dog is this?
Lt's our dog,
l made a mistake.
L should have killed him there,
You would kill him,
then you will keep cutting the
playground's ribbon forever,
Do you have any issue?
Who could make me hero in
people's view,
Politics plays on issues.
And today l got that issue.
All street dogs couldn't be dangerous,
Let me finish,
You must have watch the news,
Yes, sir!
So you must have understand for
this campaign's success,
it's necessary for that dog
to be caught.
Yes,
Because war has started from him,
Don't worry,
Veeru did the same what a friend
have to do for his friend,
Then how veeru could be wrong,
We will get NOC.
My papa will handle everything,
Society has decided that...
this dog can't get NOC.
We just said that veeru won't
go from the colony,
but we almost forgot that we
were just childs.
What is this NOC?
Very simple, even Jhangia knows,
Like DDLJ and K3G.
L was just telling him,
l didn't even get a single certificate,
What kind of certificate?
This is society's certificate,
which has written,
lf Veeru will stay in our society then
nobody have any problem,
But society has refused,
Society's rule book,
lt has written if more than 50%
society will say,
that Veeru should get NOC,
then Veeru will get NOC.
Then Tondon uncle can't do anything,
We have 60 flats in our society,
What is the 50% of that?
26.
30.
Lt means we will have to bring
31 signatures.
Lt means we will have to visit
31 flats.
We have decided that we will
fight for Veeru.
We have only 27 days left.
Everyone will have bring their dad's
and other's signature
lf l will ask signature then my dad
will slap me,
You want to save Veeru.
Then get beated, get scolded
get whatever you want,
but must bring the signature,
Please!
L said l won't give you signature,
Now you will ask me for Mercedes
so Shall l bring him,
l don't have time for these things,
Pay attention on your studies.
Do you think that you can do it.
L will sign it,
You are doing such a noble job,
You want my signature,
You won't get it,
How could l give my signature.
For this stupid job,
Nice muscles,
What do you want?
Please bring signature from dad.
You failed again?
No!
L want to get veeru pass.
You need signatures?
Yes,
Don't come here again,
l don't need your help.
L won't sign it.
We just got 10 signatures after
a great hard working,
Why they are not signing?
What's the problem with them?
Everyone is afraid from minister.
What's the matter?
L am thinkning why everyone is
scared from minister.
Because he is such a powerful man,
He have public support,
You mean if somebody have public
support he became powerful.
So we should go to public.
Lf you think whatever you are doing
that's right,
But if l will do it then my dad
will beat me alot.
You don't look so sad.
You also came to laugh on us,
l didn't come for laugh but to help,
What will you help us?
You are also a child and nobody
listen to child.
Lf you want that people should hear
and see you,
and you want to fight with minister,
then you will have to come on tv
like me,
But how we will come on tv?
What's the big deal?
But what will be that breaking news?
Since when did you start reading
newspaper.
Ram is reading,
Go and get it from him,
Few reporters have come,
Speaking dog lives here, Yes!
But it's not a famous newspaper.
Nowadays your society is
coming in news.
How would you know?
You were asleep.
We got 5 more signatures.
We will get the rest of signatures.
And Veeru won't go anywhere.
Elders couldn't take child labour,
Now what we can do?
Phatka don't have parents,
lf he won't work then how would
we earn the money,
What will he eat?
Have you seen children's condition,
There must be some solution,
What can l do?
Minister is personally interested in
this case.
Rule is that elder can't keep
child labour,
but there is no rule that children
can't take child labour,
Not cars but you can wash
our cycles.
We will give you salary from
our pocket money,
We won't give up so easily.
Where is Lucky?
He is gone with friends,
He don't want to study.
He finished his entire homework.
When Veeru will get NOC then we
will wear him,
We still needs 16 signatures.
But only 7 days are left.
Now we don't have another
breaking news.
We must have to do something,
So it shouldn't be small news but
it should be big breaking news.
With a photo.
So what should we do? We should
wander in city with underwear.
But only few naked childs couldn't
make it,
l need some money,
l will return you next month,
No! L don't need money for
dirty jobs,
Where did you get this money?
You are not doing some job what
you shouldn't do.
L saved some money to buy new clothes.
But it's more important than Veeru.
Jhangia didn't come,
What?
Your underwear is very unique.
Lt's a style.
He is my son,
What's his name?
Lf you want...
then we will give him NOC and we
will keep him with us,
lf you will keep him then veeru
will still leave us.
So what's the mean of this fight?
Lt's also a Veeru's world and who we
are to issue him NOC.
L think Veeru must get NOC.
He must get it,
and what do you think?
Lf l would be in that society so
l must give him NOC.
Find out how many votes they got?
We need only one signature,
and only one day is left.
Where we will find this
last signature.
They couldn't save the dog,
Everyone has casted his vote.
Now nobody else will give vote.
Lt will be finish tomorrow.
They are fond of wander nacked.
They will lose their dog.
Because l want that public
should understand,
that what l am doing,
it's only for our society,
it's good for this city.
L was already not in his favour,
He insisted me so l signed it,
Minister is such a stubborn man,
What will he get to bother the kids.
That minister will ruin them,
just for a dog.
But perhaps you guys are not realising
one thing,
it's notjust a matter of dog's life.
Lt's a matter of these kid's life.
These kids have fought this war
on their own,
Now when the decision time has come
so we are asking them surrender.
So what do you want?
Our kids should be insulted
in front of all.
L am not saying that.
Let them insult...
Mine and your son will must go.
These kids have fought this war
like a team,
that's why everyone will go.
That night nobody of us got sleep.
May be that was our last
night with Veeru,
We will go straight from the school.
You come with Gugly.
Today is your big day,
Go in new shirt.
L feel very good to see you all
in clothes.
L was afraid that they shouldn't
come here nacked.
L am scared from these kids because
these are our country's future.
Their society has refused to give NOC
so they lied to everyone.
They said someone of them talk
to that dog.
Then l am just taking street dogs
out from this city,
What wrong their society has done?
Who doesn't want that some street
dog should live in their society.
You go to school?
Let me see...
what they teach you in school.
L don't think they have something
to say,
Finish your programme.
And let's go.
L have to go,
What did you say?
Lt's written in my school book,
We knew that we couldn't
defeat you,
but still we came here to save Veeru,
lf we won't help Veeru.
Then your men could take him anyway.
