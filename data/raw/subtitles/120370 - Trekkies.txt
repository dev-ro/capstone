We're going to
have a good time.
& Oh, yeah &
& Yeah, yeah, yeah &
& Oh, yeah &
Ignition sequence.
5...4...
3...2...1.
Power transfer is complete.
I didn't watch Star Trek,
the original series,
in the first season
before I was on.
I mean, I took one look
at the styrofoam rocks,
and I said, "Forget it.
I'm not going to watch this."
Tlhingan hol dajatlh'a'?
It means, "Can you
speak Klingon?"
You have to give
the right answer.
Otherwise, there's
dire consequences.
I dance at powwows, and I'm into
the lndian way of life and things,
and I'm also a Trekker.
It's the greatest feeling
in the world,
and I do it about 30 to 35
to 40 times a year.
To walk out onstage
and to feel that love
that just pours
right out at you,
and it's just fans.
Kirk lmpersonator:
I've been a fan.
I grew up with it,
so I couldn't help but be a fan.
This is the Andorian
ambassador Edvaark,
and I am guard number 48,
and this is guard number 28.
That's right.
You have to understand
that, um...
even now, I still have--
I still have an ongoing process
of trying to grasp all of this,
even now.
The name's Douglas Marcks.
I live in Portland.
I've been a fan of Star Trek
for a number of years.
I mean, I actually started
watching it back in the sixties.
You know, I've been in this
for 7 years now,
and it's starting
to become normal.
[Applause]
[Cheering]
In 1987, I auditioned for a show called
Star Trek: The Next Generation.
Now, I must admit that I went to
this audition with some hesitation.
I mean, after all, it was a rehash
of a cult-status sci-fi series,
and it had a profound effect
on the original cast members' careers.
But since I was unknown,
unemployed,
and unclear as to where
any of this was headed,
I went.
What I didn't know was that
I was becoming part of something
much larger than
just a new TV series.
I was becoming
part of a phenomenon.
My name is John Paladin.
The Klingon name is Kirg.
I'm Harminder Pal
from Glasgow, Scotland.
My name is, um,
is...Who am l?
You're a lieutenant
commander.
I'm Lieutenant Commander Horatio,
and, um,
from the starship
Battle Queen.
My name's David Silverman.
I'm from central New Jersey.
- Canton, Ohio.
- San Diego.
- Virginia.
- Melbourne, Australia.
- Biloxi, Mississippi.
- Berlin, Germany.
I have fans that write me
from Germany, from ltaly,
from Australia,
from England.
I've been to conventions
in all those places.
How many conventions
have you been to?
Probably close to 50 or 60.
Really?
Yeah. I mean, like I said,
you got to have
something to do.
This is my third convention.
We've been to probably
20 or 30 or more.
I lost count, you know?
I've been doing this
since 1969,
so it's, uh,
I almost hate to admit
this is my 366th convention
this weekend.
I have attended, over the course
of about 8 years,
28 conventions.
I'm going to be spending
this day in preparation
to go the Pasadena
Star Trek/ Babylon 5 convention.
I'm going right now
to pick up my new, tailor-made
Star Trek: First Contact uniform
to wear tomorrow.
Hey, Travis.
Hey, Gabriel. How you doing?
Come on in.
Uh, so Linda dropped it off?
Yes, she did.
This is the uniform
to be featured
in Star Trek: First Contact.
Linda Thuringer, our club's
captain and Garak impersonator,
really outdid herself here, except
I do have a couple of minor quibbles,
Iike the red stripe here.
In the actual movie, it's going to be
about half this thickness,
but she can change that easily.
And the lines running across here are
more prominent in the actual versions,
but then again, she can just
do some topstitching there.
She wanted to take the legs
down a bit. I don't see why.
But overall, fantastic.
This is going to be
your car, Gabriel?
I hope so,
because I'm 14.
I'll be 15 in June.
Another year after that,
I'll be getting my license.
It's the Roddenberry.
I wish it could fly.
I'm ready to go to another planet.
I'll tell you that much.
Gabriel: Obviously,
someone never grew out of the 1960s.
Y eah. I spent a lot of time
in vans, that's for sure.
We're going to put
a laser beam on the front
so when we're driving
on a foggy day,
we can shoot, like,
a 1,000-foot beam.
My name is Lieutenant Commander
Barbara Adams.
I'm commanding officer
of the U.S.S. Artemis,
which is the Little Rock unit
of the Federation Alliance.
I'm here at the sci-fi
convention in Boston,
where Federation Alliance
has brought some of our things up here.
I've come because a lot of people have
shown a lot of interest in what I did
in going to the trial
in my uniform.
I was selected, summoned for the jury
for the Whitewater trial
in Little Rock, Arkansas.
We've had a lot of curious people
asking about the organization
and also looking into my drawings,
which I do as sort of a hobby.
I studied graphic design,
and I enjoy drawing,
and I also enjoy drawing
the Star Trek people.
One of our charters
in the Federation Alliance
is to perform community service,
and as commanding officer,
I'm the role model for my crew,
and so I felt it was necessary and a
good decision for me to wear my uniform.
For more than a week, everybody's seen
the picture of Barbara Adams...
And each morning, there seemed
to be more and more reporters
because they were waiting to see
if I was going to come in my uniform,
and it got to the point
where there was just a wall
of cameras, tripods, reporters,
and I would literally have
to walk all the way around them
just to get to the door
because they would not move.
It just got ridiculous.
My brother had a picture of her
on our refrigerator for two months
walking out of the courtroom
in Arkansas.
Adams: And one of the newspapers
had reported that every day,
I would walk past the reporters
with a Vulcan-like stoicism.
Wow!
So, they don't know how close
they actually hit the mark,
because usually, before
all this brewed up,
I would always come
to these conventions
and our appearances
as a Vulcan.
There was a bus driver
that I'd already met.
He kept asking me,
"What are you going to do?
Why do you keep wearing the uniform?
What are you going to do if
the president comes down to testify?"
And I said,
"I'll wear my uniform."
He said, "But it's the president
of the United States!"
"I'll wear my uniform."
We came to a stoplight.
He turned around and he looked at me,
and he said,
"You are a brave woman."
Every day, I wear
my communicator badge,
my rank pips,
and my tricorder.
[Badge Beeps]
To me, as being an officer in
the Federation Alliance 24 hours a day,
even when I'm not in uniform,
I still want that known
that I'm at heart
a Starfleet officer.
I used to read about her
in the newspaper, and I saw her,
and I got her autograph.
Basically, the philosophy
behind Star Trek
that she is so,
um, promoting...
is the philosophy
behind an honest juror.
That's what you need on a jury
is an open-minded person.
Based on the ideals of Star Trek, yeah,
I think she'd be an asset.
This is what she wants to do.
This is America.
I mean, we should be able to do
what we want to do.
You know, look how we want to
look, say what we want to say.
I think she's a pretty neat lady
to have the guts to, um,
kind of be herself,
even on an important thing
like being a juror.
You can put on a uniform for football
year-round, nobody cares.
Basketball year-round,
nobody cares.
Put on a Star Trek uniform,
people get a case of the giggles.
I don't want my officers to ever
feel ashamed to wear their uniform.
And...so,
I went to a civic duty.
What we do is community service.
I was performing my civic duty.
I wore my uniform,
just as any other officer
in the military would wear theirs.
I came to meet the stars.
I like to see
a different side of the stars,
the personal side.
DeForest Kelley:
While I was in Florida,
RuthAnn presented me
with this belt buckle
on my 138th birthday.
[Laughter]
Now...Now then, every time
I see someone,
they say, you know, "You look
so much younger in person."
[Laughter]
The first one that I did, um...
I think was around '72.
Um, I got a call
to come to New Y ork.
They had done
one convention first,
and I think it wasn't
really a convention.
They got together
with about 35 or 40 or 50--
the way I heard the story--
of fans of Star Trek
that just wanted to get together and
talk about the show, which they did.
And they said, "You know,
why don't we put our money together
and rent a hotel ballroom?"
"And talk about
our mutual interest
and show each other
what we have collected so far
in the way of tapes
or paraphernalia or photographs."
If we could get 300 people
to attend,
we could...we could pay for it."
And I thought,
"They're inviting me to New Y ork?
They said they're
willing to pay expenses
and, you know, fly me there
and put me up in a hotel."
I thought,
"These people are foolish."
And, uh...
there was something like,
I think there were around
3,000 or 4,000 people showed up,
and it was absolutely wild then.
They had to call the fire
department into the hotel
to let them in in increments.
Everything came to a dead stop.
It was jam-packed with humanity.
The revolving doors
couldn't revolve.
The escalators refused
to operate anymore.
The elevators stopped working.
And the din out there indicated
it was more than 30 people.
The woman went onstage
and introduced me,
and I stepped out, and the place
exploded in applause.
Kelley: And then they were
hanging out of the balcony.
It was like a bunch
of overaged Beatles for us, you know,
me being there.
Nimoy: There was hardly
a chance to speak
because every word
created a roar.
Every time somebody opened their mouths
to say hello, it created a roar.
A wall of emotional sound hit you.
And we were all
kind of taken aback
and moved and touched by it
because it was this
tremendous affection,
this tremendous affection.
And now there is
a Star Trek convention--
There are Star Trek conventions
somewhere every weekend
all over the world.
Hi.
Hi there.
Can I have
a schedule, please?
Ah. Majel.
Definitely got to see Majel.
She's onstage right now.
She's on the stage now?
Ooh.
You're going to love it.
It was Gene's story and Gene's script,
and it was Gene's pilot.
What time is the auction?
The auction is 2:20
this afternoon.
Oh, there it is.
OK. This was worn by John Colicos
in which episode?
"Blood Oath."
"Blood Oath."
And this is the Turtle,
as they call it.
Michael Dorn calls it
the Great Turtle.
Turtle head.
There's speed bumps.
Uh, there's, Whoopi Goldberg
says "old lntestine Head."
And, um, the other one I heard
is Rocky Mountains.
That's the latest one.
Here is the opening bid
for this. $500.
[Audience Members Whistle]
$500. We've got a $500 bid,
and it's there to a Klingon.
Man: I'll go 550.
550.
Klingon: 6.
600. 600.
Do I hear 650?
650.
1,000? $1,000!
$1,000.
1,100.
$1,100!
Klingon: $1,200.
What? 1,200?
Yeah.
1,200. OK.
$1,200.
$1,200.
13.
$1,300.
Klingon: 14.
14. $1,400.
Going once.
$1,400. Going twice.
$1,400...sold at a bargain!
[Cheering]
Qapla', man.
Qapla'.
I was bidding
on the headpiece,
and the price started
getting up to the point
where I really wasn't interested
in paying that much.
That Klingon
really wanted it.
He really wanted
that headpiece. Y es.
So, how badly
did you want it?
I wouldn't have
left without it.
It's a little bit of history
that I'll preserve.
I collect the items
when I can get them,
and they're wonderful to have.
They're definitely
one-of-a-kind items.
Man: Everything we touch,
whether it be a little piece of hair
or a nose or something small,
there's a whole cult market out there
where a lot of the pieces sell
for hundreds and thousands of dollars.
What we see in these rooms
literally could run into the millions,
you know, if we opened up
a market on the outside of it.
So we're very guarded.
Everything we keep under lock and key.
Unfortunately,
John de Lancie
couldn't make it
to this show this weekend
due to professional
commitments.
We do have an autograph here.
Man: Well, the Q virus
was the most bizarre thing.
John de Lancie, who plays Q, was--
He barely made it to the convention.
He was really sick.
I mean, very ill.
Dizzy, questioning whether
he was going to go onstage,
but he was a real trouper,
and he went up onstage and did his show,
and, you know,
he left his water glass.
And I held up the glass
and I said, "Who would be interested
in purchasing the Q virus?"
And it was kind of a joke, but
the crowd just went absolutely crazy.
They went bonkers for the thing.
So, you know, I went ahead
and auctioned off the glass,
and it went for, I don't know,
40, $60 or something like this.
And a guy bought it, and he
came up, and I said, "Look"--
It was half-full
still of water--
I said, "Look, you really
don't want to drink this.
He's very sick. I mean,
he's very, very ill."
"Oh, no, no. I want to drink it.
I want to drink it."
And he just downed
the whole glass right there,
And he yelled out, "I've got
the Q virus! I've got the Q virus!"
And he planned to spread it
all over the world.
You know, that was his thing.
I was walking down the street
in New Y ork,
and I caught somebody
coming towards me.
He said, "are you Q?"
And I said, "Y eah."
"Can you bring people back
from the dead?"
And I went,
"Uh...only people I like."
And he goes, "Cool."
And walked on.
There was a fan who,
in 1973 in New York,
came up to Jimmy Doohan,
who I was with,
and pulled out a box
that had a hypodermic in it
and asked Jimmy if he could
get a sample of his blood.
A woman...
stood up in one
of the conventions and said,
"What's it feel like
to be beamed?"
20 years later, he was
at a convention in New Y ork,
and the same young man
came up to him with the same box
with the same hypodermic
and said, "Mr. Doohan,
can I get a sample of your blood?"
He was still doing
the same thing 20 years later.
Man: There's one gentleman
who for about, what, 10 years?
Second Man: Almost the whole run.
Almost the whole run of since
the beginning of The Next Generation
has been sending something
in the mail every day to Star Trek.
Every day.
The funny thing is, it has
nothing to do with Star Trek.
He sends us travel brochures,
um...and that's all he sends.
And postcards talking about
where he travels.
Or sometimes, he describes--
Well, look at this one.
We've got a Victoria's Secret
catalog that he sent...
Something about a mission,
a fruit trees
and landscaping catalog,
Caribbean, Hawaii,
Canada, Australia.
He also will sometimes send
postcards talking about
what he had for lunch that day
or what he ate or how many
cups of coffee he drank,
and it's always to Star Trek,
but it's never about Star Trek.
And we always wondered
about this guy.
Who is he? Where is he from?
And why is he sending us these things?
And if you-- Over 10 years, every day,
that's quite a few packages.
Man: OK. Here we go.
Woman: Rolling.
And action, please.
Maybe you didn't read the crew roster,
but my name is Dax, and I'm the new
science officer on this garbage scow,
and you were in my seat.
And cut! Very nice.
LeVar Burton: There was a young man
who was confined to a wheelchair,
and his name was Jordan La Forge.
The young man was given
6 months to a year to live,
and, uh, he attributes
the fact that he lived
for many years after his prognosis
to the fact that he watched Star Trek.
Finally, when he did pass away,
Gene just thought that
having somebody in that place,
you know, as Geordi,
would be a perfect example,
a perfect sort of-- A nice thing
to do in memory of him.
Originally, Geordi
was the pilot of the ship,
so he wanted the pilot to be,
you know, the blind man,
and the blind man is the one
that's flying this ship.
I watched the original series
with my mother and brother
when I was a kid,
and I enjoyed it.
At this point, I enjoy
his enthusiasm more.
I enjoy the shows, I enjoy
the conventions, I like dressing up,
I love dressing her up,
but I enjoy his fanaticism.
It's contagious.
Crosby: And what makes you
a fanatic as opposed to a fan?
I think the fact that
I'm so much into it.
I do a lot of collecting.
I relate to so much of it.
I know a lot about it.
It's more than just a casual
"l enjoy the show, I enjoy the concept."
I'm really into it.
This is the Trek room.
This is, you know, my room.
I can design it
the way I want.
I can put what I want in it.
Woman: Although you do notice
it's spilling out
into the other areas
of the house.
Y es.
This is the bathroom,
and we've carried
the Trek theme in here.
We have our Starfleet towel set,
and all of our
Federation blue tile here.
We offset it with these
3 hand-painted Trek tiles--
the planets, the Enterprise,
and one of the enemy.
George Takei: We asked whether
we might visit Cape Canaveral,
Nichelle and l, and we peered
in one of the portholes,
and there were astronauts
working in that.
They turned around and looked,
and they recognized our
two faces peering in at them,
and you should have
seen their eyes light up.
And they came scrambling
out of that place,
and the first thing they did was ask us,
"Can we have your autographs, please?"
We went there
to get their autographs,
and they in turn
were asking us for ours.
Buzz Aldrin: Star Trek
came along at a time
when I think the public
was really kind of hungry
for that sort of adventure,
and it went a long ways toward
stimulating a lot of interest
into the space program.
Star Trek is a cultural icon,
and it's part of the lexicon now.
As a psychotherapist, I have
Star Trek stuff in my office,
and I use Star Trek metaphors
that everyone understands,
even if they're not a fan.
For example, when I talk about
people having a defensive reaction,
I talk about the shields going up,
and everyone knows what that means,
even if they're not a fan.
The front part of my office-- that is,
the part that the patients see--
is a pretty straightforward
surgical office.
My own private consulting room
is just filled with Star Trek stuff.
I'm Denis Bourguignon.
This is my son Doug,
my wife Shelley,
and my daughter Kayla.
Crosby: We're here
in Orlando, Florida,
at the dental offices
of Dr. Denis Bourguignon.
- Denis: Good morning.
- Good morning. How are you?
- Pleasure to see you.
Welcome to Star Base Dental.
- Good to see you.
Denis, Voice-Over: We originally decided
that we wanted to go with Star Trek
because we find that Star Trek, the
episodes are always geared with a moral.
They're good-doers, and we wanted
to portray dentistry or dentists
as good-doers.
Crosby:
So, um, this is reception.
Denis: Yes. This is reception.
This is where the patients check in.
This is our holodeck
over here on the left.
This is where I do
most of my work.
This is where you get fillings,
crowns, dentures, things like that.
We were just in a sci-fi store
one day, Shelley and l,
and we kind of looked at
each other, and we said, "Hey."
[Together]
You thinking what I'm thinking?
And we said,
"Let's try it."
[Transporter Sound Effect]
Two weeks later, we just
closed down the office over the weekend,
and we bought up
everything we could find,
and, boom!
We did a Star Base Dental.
As you can see, our transporter
is up in the ceiling over here.
It transports you away from here
while we're working on you.
These are some
nice pieces over here.
These are my cement handprints
of some of the stars.
You're about
James Doohan's size.
Crosby: No, wait.
There's a finger missing!
A gardening accident.
I never knew that.
This is the first theme office
I worked in.
I really like it.
It's neat.
It's fun to come to work.
Yeah. It's different
to come to work.
You don't know what's
going to be around.
They bring something different
in all the time.
Every morning you come in,
you wonder, "Well, what's
going to be on these walls
that wasn't here before?"
The uniform
I wouldn't do at first.
I told them no.
That wasn't possible for me.
Crosby: And you just--
How long did you hold out?
Uh, about--
Almost a year.
Almost a year before I was--
I was the last one to put it on.
What made you finally turn the corner?
He told me I had to.
[Laughter]
She cried a few times.
He told me I had to.
We actually dress up
like this at home,
and we take turns being different
characters, and it helps our, um...
- Relationship. Yeah.
- Yeah, it does.
-Always going out with different people.
-Crosby: Really?
Yeah. I haven't done you yet
because I'm not tall enough,
so he usually puts a wig on.
He has to portray you.
And then I have to
be Data or Quark.
Yeah, Quark.
Sometimes Quark.
Crosby: And how do
the patients respond?
Most of them like it.
I think the Star Trek theme
in the dentist's office is great.
It takes your mind off
where you really are.
It's not like any other
dentist office I've ever been in,
that's for sure.
Denis: Most people,
even if they don't like Star Trek,
Iike the idea of it.
I've only had one person
who didn't like the idea,
but he wasn't happy about his bill
in the first place, so...
Denis: Good afternoon, Preston.
How you doing?
Hey, Denis. How are you?
Good to see you.
Come on back.
Let's go ahead
and get you going here.
Go ahead
and take a look here.
Number two, occlusal lingual.
Number 3 crown.
Denis, Voice-Over:
Shelley and I started in another office
at about the same time,
and Shelley started
as the front-desk receptionist.
After about a while,
she liked dentistry so much,
she decided she wanted
to maybe assist,
so I brought her back,
and I taught her to assist,
and, uh...we worked
very well together,
so we decided to make it
a bond for life,
and we're together now forever.
I'm dressed as a NASA astronaut
that was actually killed
that they investigated
the death of
in an episode called
"The Royale"
of The Next Generation--
Um, at least, that was
the original idea,
and then I kind of
moved on. Ha ha!
Kind of character-developed it
a little bit.
Instead of it being him,
it's his wife.
Ha ha ha!
So what is your interest
in Star Trek?
Mainly Brent--
Brent Spiner--
Lieutenant Commander Data
on The Next Generation,
as you well know.
Ha ha!
Yes, I know him well.
Now, you guys call yourself...
Spiner femmes.
- Spiner femmes.
- Yes.
Spiner femmes?
I like that.
It's good, isn't it?
Spiner femmes.
I think there's a series in that.
This is my Brent page.
When I find out
that somebody else
has discovered Brent
through my web page,
I feel really good about it.
I feel-- Yeah, it's another fan here.
Let other people outside
of the Star Trek universe
know who he is.
He's not just Data.
This is where I keep--
right down here--
I keep...
all the important
collectibles.
Got the videos,
T-shirts, mugs--
the important stuff.
If there's an earthquake, a fire,
I want this stuff to be intact.
This is my photo album.
These are more convention photos
and more convention photos
and even more convention
photos and...
Ha ha ha! It goes on for days.
These ones--
I always put them in
so they're all facing
the same order.
Once I get through with these,
then it switches to ones
this way.
Saves having to turn the photo album
every two minutes.
Palm Springs convention.
This is actually--
I took over 100 pictures
at the Palm Springs convention,
and when I got them back,
I took a picture
of all the pictures I took.
A lot of these are enlargements
of convention photos.
I had a calendar made up one year
for a couple of friends
for Christmas presents.
That's my back right there.
I gave him--
It was a Texas stamp they issued,
and they issued a sheet
that told about the background
of Texas and all that.
I ordered it
from the post office
and framed it for him
since he's from Texas.
Spiner: I don't get
much stuff anymore
because I've sort of let it be known
when I've done conventions and stuff
that it wasn't necessary and it wasn't
really a good idea because--
that the people should be spending
their money on me, you know? Ha ha!
I mean, I tried
to express that we do OK
and that they should really,
you know, save their money.
Woman: It's not about the money.
It gives me a good feeling.
I like to do that
for my friends, too.
If I can find
something unusual--
I like to get unusual gifts
for people.
After I'd lived here
about a year
and I found out
where Brent lived,
I realized I could just see--
I can't see his house,
but I can see the hill--
the top of the hill
that he lives at the bottom of
from the balcony,
and so when I'm stressed out,
I come out here sometimes
and just sit out here for a few minutes
to take what I call
a "Brent break"
and just kind of gaze
off in that direction
and daydream
for a little while.
Crosby: What are some
of your favorite things
that you like to do
at conventions?
Ever heard of filking?
No. Tell me what that is.
Science-fiction
folk singing.
Uh, could you explain that?
Well, actually
I could give you an example.
Perfect.
Uh, episode of the original series
called "Space Seed,"
which was the launching
for the second movie,
The Wrath Of Khan.
There is a song.
The song is called Vow of Vengeance.
It's Khan's vow.
Let's-- Let's see.
& The summer sunlight &
& The howling at night &
& The blood of friends spilled &
& On the sand &
& I'll meet some quick death &
& She breathes her last breath &
& And dies as I cling to her hand &
& Mere mortals you be &
& The truth you can see &
& You think you have right but-- &
[Quietly]
And you-- Wait, wait.
It's been a while
since I've sung it.
& You think-- &
No.
Action!
An alliance
with the Borg?
Janeway:
More like an exchange.
If we teach the Borg how
to modify their own nanoprobes,
they'd have a blueprint to create
a weapon to fight the aliens.
Cut!
When I am asked to go
to a hospital,
it's a specific boy,
and he's not going to be there
the next time I go
to that hospital,
and it means a great deal to him
that I be honest with him
in that hour that we share
together, you know?
That can change your life.
There's a woman
who's almost totally paralyzed,
and she was able
to just kind of
with the help
of an interpreter say,
"For the hour
that you are on"--
meaning Star Trek is on--
"l forget the body
that I am imprisoned in."
I got a fan letter
from a young lady.
It was a suicide note.
So l, uh-- I called her.
I said,
"Hey, this is Jimmy Doohan--
Scotty of Star Trek."
I said, "I'm doing
a convention in lndianapolis.
I want to see you there."
I saw her.
Boy, I'm telling you--blah.
I couldn't believe what I saw.
That was--
She was definitely suicidal.
You know...
somebody had to help her
somehow, you know,
and obviously
she wasn't going
to the right people,
you know.
Anyhow, I said to her--
I said, "I'm doing a convention
two weeks from now in St. Louis,
and two weeks from then
in something," you know,
and then eventually--
she also came to New York.
She was able to afford
to go to these places
and everything else, so, uh...
And then that went on
for 2 or 3 years...
maybe 18 times...
and all I did was talk
positive things to her,
and then all of a sudden--
Pfft! Nothing.
I didn't hear anything,
and I had no idea
what was happening to her
because I really never saved
her address, right?
8 years later,
I get a letter...
saying, "l do want
to thank you so much
for what you did for me
because I just got
my master's degree
in electronic engineering."
You know, that's...
to me, the best thing
I've ever done in my life,
and it brings
tears to my eyes
every time I even talk
about the story.
Shatner: Over a period
of several years,
we've raised several
hundred thousand dollars
for these 3 charities.
This is what Star Trek does.
Star Trek is part entertainment
and part philosophy,
and this part of Star Trek
goes unnoticed
to most of the public.
I have a question.
Have you thought
about actually talking
to schoolteachers?
I'm a schoolteacher--
and talking to schools
and getting them
to talk to the kids about it?
- Can you help us organize that?
- Sure!
Woman:
I teach kindergarten,
so sometimes it's a little hard
for them to grasp
the concept of racial diversity
and ethnic diversity,
so if you have a show
like Star Trek
that shows a bunch of different aliens
and a bunch
of different-colored people
and different types of people
all getting along,
it works wonderfully
to illustrate that point.
Star Trek has changed the way
that I teach science,
specifically space science.
By giving children
an immediate frame of reference
that they know of,
that they can get excited about,
it just inspires
their imagination.
This is something
we've been excited about
because it's carried on.
Having Kate Mulgrew portray
the captain on the Voyager...
They feel that it's the first time
that they can sit down as a family
and view a woman
in a leadership role
as a family without having to
carry on a conversation
about who's being victimized
or what does she stand for.
She is so obviously a woman
of authority and strength,
but she's not a witch
with a capital "B," you know?
She's-- She's just
a person in authority.
I get a great deal of mail
from women who say
that they watch Voyager
with their daughters
and how good it makes them feel
to be able to point
to the screen and say,
"See? You can be anything."
What do you want to do
when you grow up?
Be an astronaut.
Mae Carol Jemison--
first African-American
woman in space.
She flew on the shuttle--
became a scientist first
and then an astronaut
because she saw
Nichelle Nichols
on the original
Star Trek series
and said, "You know what?
That's for me."
There were two little girls
around 9 years old,
8 years old,
when Star Trek
first came on,
and one of them told me
years later,
"l looked on that television
and I saw you.
I saw this black lady,
and I ran through the house
screaming,
Come quick! Come quick!
There's a black lady
on television,
and she ain't no maid!"
Ha ha ha!
And she said,
"l knew right then and there
I could be anybody
I wanted to be.
I could be anything
I wanted to be."
And so she decided to be
a superstar.
Ha ha! And her name
is Whoopi Goldberg.
I'm Joyce Mason.
And I'm Evelyn de Biase.
And we host a radio show called
Talk Trek and Beyond.
The way it got started was,
we were on our lunch hour
one time at work,
and we thought
about Trek-- talking Trek.
You know, it's a lot of fun,
something we do a lot of,
so we decided it would be
a great radio show.
How do you do it?
Well, I called up
the directory assistance
on the phone,
and I asked for the telephone number
of a radio station,
and she asked me...
"Which one do you want?"
I didn't know,
so I said, "Pick one."
And she did.
She picked out
this radio station--KAV.
We packed up our things,
went over.
Two weeks later,
we were on the air.
First time.
That was 7 years ago,
and we're still on!
Ha ha ha! And it's been
a lot of fun.
We didn't have the foggiest idea
what we were doing that first night,
but--
And we still don't. Ha ha!
Man:...a convention on the air.
[Fanfare Playing]
Evening, gentle beings.
How are you all doing tonight?
Welcome to Talk Trek and Beyond.
This is Joyce.
We're delighted
to be with you.
We're going to have
a good time tonight.
We have a very special guest
with us-- Denise Crosby.
Denise Crosby!
Yay! Woo-hoo!
Hey, guys,
are you ready?
I know that our listeners
are just dying to talk to you.
Hey, John in Portland, Oregon,
on line one.
Hey, Portland!
John: Yes, hi, you guys.
Hi, Denise.
Crosby: Hi, John.
One thing I'd like to say--
without "Skin of Evil,"
there could have been
no "Yesterday's Enterprise."
Right, exactly. There's some irony
in that, isn't there?
- Yes.
- I mean, I always felt I had to die
and get off the show
to get the best episode.
I love this-- being able to talk
to you like this
because when the show
originally aired,
my father passed away.
I'm sorry.
And the weird thing about it was,
the friends that were there--
a lot of them are Trek fans
and were around me at the time,
and we sat down
and watched that episode.
The strangest thing
about it was,
by the time it got to the end
and the holographic message
and the whole thing,
it actually helped me
a great deal,
and here I get
to thank you personally,
which I did appreciate it,
and I still do.
John, I'm really touched.
I think so many times
that people don't realize
just how important
a show can be.
It can destroy you, or it can--
as in a case like this--
give you
a tremendous amount of comfort.
Oh, yes, between the ending
and the holographic imaging
and the cloud
and everything,
it was just exactly
what I needed at the time.
John, I don't know how to say
thank you for that tonight--
for sharing that with us.
I thank you for Talk Trek.
You're welcome. Thank you
for being with us, my friend.
There's nothing like
a bunch of Trek people
getting together someplace
and just sitting and talking.
They'll go for 24 hours
or more, and--
And that's why it's called Talk Trek
rather than Trek Talk--
because it's not just a matter
of talking about Trek,
but rather it's a whole
universe within itself.
Just like people talk
French and talk German,
we talk Trek.
Crosby: So what does your bathtub
look like at the end of the day?
It looks very green.
Ha ha! Trust me on that.
Who is your favorite captain?
Have to be Captain Kirk.
Captain Picard.
I'm kind of a Kirk fan.
I like Kirk because
he was the first captain.
The original,
the prototype
for everything else
that came along afterwards.
Absolutely Kirk.
Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
- Picard.
- Picard.
- Picard.
Now, there's
a very handsome man.
There's a very handsome
man-- Captain Picard.
Who's your favorite captain?
Data.
Well, Data's not a captain.
No, I don't like
any captains.
Who's going to beat
Captain Kirk?
Come on! Come on!
He's a stud!
I can only say Janeway.
Janeway's a stud, too,
but-- Ha ha!
- Janeway.
- Janeway.
I'd probably say split
between Janeway and Kirk.
Kirk.
I like Avery Brooks, too,
but that's because he's cute.
Crosby: Who's your
favorite captain?
Ha ha ha! I am.
I couldn't pick
one captain over another.
The emissary!
The emissary
is different.
You must remember
the emissary.
He is most important,
but to place the others
above the emissary
would not be right.
When I got the job,
everybody said,
"Oh, the Trekkers,
the Trekkies."
Well, in fact,
they're very smart.
One has to be smart
to connect science
with the imagination.
That's what's
really interesting to me--
that a show could have fans
that span and bridge
every sort of
classification.
Stephen Hawking
and Mel Brooks
and, you know,
Dr. Marvin Minsky--
who's head of the robotics
department at M.I.T.--
or the Mercury astronauts.
Accountants,
these are lawyers.
These are people who just
really, really enjoy the program.
There's this preconceived notion
that they are
a peculiar bunch of people,
you know?
I don't think I've ever
met anyone--
Star Trek fan or not--
who wasn't peculiar.
I mean, we're all peculiar,
aren't we?
The word "fan" actually is
an abbreviated form of "fanatic,"
and there are some people
who fit that category,
who are the people
who really do need to get a life,
but most fans are pretty normal people
who have a hobby,
who have a sense
of the desire to escape,
and they know it's a show,
and nobody really gets lost
in it, but it's just fun.
Woman: We are the largest ship
in the San Diego area.
We do a lot
of community service.
We go and visit
abused children in hospitals,
and we work fairs,
and we're having
a miniature golf tournament
in two weeks, and--
Dressed as Klingons?
Yes.
You play miniature golf
dressed as Klingons?
Yes, yes. We're going to donate
the money to charity.
My name is Marc Okrand,
and what I've done
is develop the Klingon language
for Star Trek.
Nuqneh!
Our only greeting translates
quite literally
to "What do you want?"
When they played
Klingon softball,
I never devised words
for "You're out," "You're safe,"
something like that,
so they had to improvise,
and the way they improvised is,
"You're dead," You're alive,"
which works just as well.
I like the way
Klingons believe--
their code of ethics
and honor.
What I've done is turn around
and tattooed the Klingon insignia.
It took me about
2 1/2 hours of work
with a homemade pen
to get it inked in.
This is a Klingon
disrupter pistol.
Two basic settings.
This is the stun--
That's the stun setting.
Never have I heard it
been used in Star Trek.
Not only has Klingon been
spoken just in the movies,
it turns out that people like
to speak the language.
People like to learn
the language.
Man: The Klingon language camp
is something
that we've been having
for the last 4 years.
It's a summer program
for people to learn
the language and customs
of the culture.
- Tlhingan hol.
- Tlhingan hol.
Tlhingan hol dajatlh'a'?
Tlhingan hol dajatlh'a'?
Maj.
How do you say
"kill"?
- Hoh!
- Hoh!
- Hoh!
- Hoh!
- Yihoh!
- Yihoh!
- Jihoh!
- Jihoh!
- Pehoh!
- Pehoh!
- Jihoh!
- Jihoh!
- Pehoh!
- Jihoh!
- Mahoh!
- Mahoh!
[Singing In Klingon]
They just came out with the first
full edition in Klingon of Hamlet.
They're working
on translating the Bible.
There's a team of scholars
doing this,
and they've translated
the theme song to Sesame Street,
the theme song
to Gilligan's lsland.
Klingons are really popular.
Klingons are
very popular. Ha ha!
It's an interesting
phenomenon. I mean--
You said that with
a straight face.
Klingons are popular
because they're fun.
Klingons allow us
as non-Klingons
to express a certain aspect
of our personality,
I think, that we're not
allowed to do in public.
Woman: I want to get
the, uh, sour cream
and chives potato.
Would you like cheese
on the Super Star or without?
Without cheese?
This combo?
OK, would you like that
supersized for 39 cents more?
It's got a large fries
and large drink.
$9.56.
16! Pick up, please!
16!
Have you ever served
a Klingon before?
Yes.
- You've served Klingons before?
- Yes.
When I was 6 years old--
January of 1989--
I attended
my first convention,
and here is a picture
from it.
Man: One day I was at home,
and I get a phone call,
and Gabriel at the time
was 6 years old,
and the school calls me up
and says, "Would you please
come and pick up your son?"
I said, "Well, what's the matter?
Is he hurt or what?"
They said,
"No. He happens to be wearing
his Star Trek uniform
and his pointed Spock
ears and full makeup,
and I don't think this is
the right attire for him
to wear at school."
It's a Catholic--
It was a Catholic school, too.
They made me come and pick him up,
which I thought was pretty funny
and it took him years
before he really could comprehend
that he wasn't supposed
to go to school like that,
but that's the way life is
when you're 6 years old.
Yeah, I was supposed to be wearing
my plaid pants and tie.
- Another interesting thing that--
- [Telephone Rings]
Oh, for God's sakes!
I'll get that. I'll get that.
Hello.
Peter, this is the worst time
you could have called!
Go away! OK, bye.
Ha ha ha!
Around this entire section here,
we have my collection
of autographed Star Trek
action figures,
and over here
I have the collection
of the 4 captains.
This Sisko here
might look a bit messy
because I shaved it
with an X-Acto knife
because of his new look
this season
and painted on a goatee
with model paint.
Over here I put up
somewhat of a chart
with my Datas
illustrating the evolution
of the uniforms
in the past few years.
We start out here with Data
in the first/second season
lycra jumpsuit,
which I heard caused
the male actors back problems;
then the third
through seventh season
two-piece uniform,
and then the Generations
jumpsuit version
and now the gray-shouldered
First Contact garbs,
which of course
I am wearing now.
Man: I normally
dress up as Data.
One lady thought that I was Data
and came up to me,
and she had her baby,
and she kept--she was like,
"Will you--Will you
touch my baby?"
I've been asked
to bless people...
One wanted me to sign
the interior of his car--
To marry people...
"Oh, wow! He touched my baby!
He touched my baby!"
Then she runs off
screaming in the halls.
One wanted me to help him
ease his way into death.
It was an odd request.
Maybe we should have told her
I wasn't Data. Ha ha!
& It's a beautiful day &
& Ooh, we'll fly away &
& It's a beautiful day... &
The Mark and Brian
radio program-- 95.5 KLOS.
All right, now, there is a Star Trek
convention in town this weekend.
A lot of Trekkies are here.
They're coming from
all over the world.
In celebration
of that group of people in town,
we-- Mark and Brian-- now give you
the Star Trek theme.
[Playing Star Trek Theme Badly]
[Shrieking Star Trek Theme]
There we go.
I'm a little busy now.
All right, we'll take
a commercial break and return.
Crosby: Do you have
a favorite episode?
The original?
Well, of course,
the original--
The original? OK.
Oh, look here, mister.
See, he shouldn't even be in this.
He doesn't even dig Star Trek.
I like Star Trek!
I like it fine!
No! You're like, "Who are those guys
with the pointy ears?"
Star Trek's
a way of life, man.
It's a good way of life.
It teaches us all.
This background here
that you see was rendered by me.
It is the Nemesis station
from Star Station Nemesis,
the film project that our club
is working on at the moment.
This is the screenplay
in its computer form.
This program is
where it was written
and where all the modifications
were made.
This script is basically
the back story
that they've conceived
for the club.
Then I translated
the outline we wrote
into the 172-page
screenplay.
What you're about to see here
are some of the fledgling
opticals I've created.
As you can see, there's
a considerable amount of detail
that went into it.
This is pan-up shot
that I did,
and as you can see,
there's a little flickering
around there
that I'm trying
to get rid of.
One thing that I've been
tinkering around with
is a Romulan armada shot.
I rendered this sequence
in two parts.
This is the logo
for the trailer
for the movie
that we're putting together
to show at not this coming
meeting, but the next one.
Woman: Gabriel and Travis,
our communications officer,
came up with the idea
to start making a movie for our club.
Gabriel designed some new uniforms
specifically for the movie.
[People Talking]
There's yours. Now...
[Applause]
They're still--
still in process.
Now you have to decide
which one you're going
to wear tomorrow.
Yeah. It will be
a tough choice.
Ha ha! Wow.
This costume is the uniform
that I've designed.
It came out of about
50 conceptual sketches,
and this is
my favorite of them
from the film project
that I'm working on,
and it should be noted that this is
only a prototypical version,
and, uh...
The collar on the completed
version will be--
come to about here,
but it's--
She kind of cut short
the collar a bit,
and it will have
shoulder pads,
and it will be all wool.
This has some wool components
and some polyester components,
and overall I think
the first version looks nice.
I've got a friend of mine
that does custom tailoring,
so he does
all my uniforms for me.
I have a dress uniform.
I've got just, like,
a couple of the regular T-shirt tops
and things like that,
and this is one of the jumpsuits.
This is normal attire for me.
We don't feel like we look
any different than anyone else anymore,
because we've been
doing it for so long.
In fact, sometimes after work I'll
be leaving and I'll have my uniform on.
People will be staring
at me, and I'm like,
"What are they staring at me for?"
To me, it's just natural.
Man: I go out a lot of times
in the uniform,
and I find it
a pretty positive thing.
Sometimes I'll get people that--
they'll give me a smile,
they'll say something or give me
a Star Trek Vulcan salute.
I've never had a negative
experience, and I enjoy it.
On a couple of occasions,
I've had people ask me
something about, "Well, how long
are you going to do this?"
Or "Why do you do all this?
Don't you have a life for real?"
And this is part
of my life for real.
Hi, Steve.
How you doing?
All right.
How are you today?
- All right.
- Good.
As long as I'm able to do it,
I'm going to do it.
Doesn't hurt anybody,
makes a lot of people feel good,
and I think that's
sort of the point of things.
Gabriel: I'm going inside now
to some of my favorite stores
to search for new
Star Trek memorabilia,
hard-to-get action figures,
and the like.
You know, I spend around
maybe 300-400 bucks a year
on Star Trek merchandise,
but if I could, I'd spend
a lot more--
about--way over 1,000.
The reality is Star Trek fans
devote more time,
energy, and finance
to their object of affection
than any other group
of people in the world.
I am a die-hard
Star Trek fan,
and I'm going
all over the country
trying to get
everything I can,
before I die, of Star Trek.
This is the Data
"Redemption"--
the red Playmates doll--
the one that's very rare
and valuable,
and I got it for $25
at a convention,
and now they're going
for $250, $300, which--
Not that I'll ever sell mine.
It's not for sale!
These dolls and things
all have numbers on their feet,
and they look for
the lowest number.
I'm about to do a valuable trade
for these two figures
from the Huntsville, Alabama,
convention
that go for
about 100 bucks apiece
because they were limited
to only 10,000
for the equally rare
Thomas Riker figure
because I'm getting
the better end of the deal
because the production number
was a bit lower
and goes
for considerably more
on the secondary market
than this set.
There you go.
These are from Huntsville.
Huntsville-- That's the only place
you can get these, huh?
And some were numbered over 10,000,
but that was a mistake.
They used parts
from another figure.
Ah! Interesting.
Thank you.
Those were actually the legs
from "The Cage" Spocks.
How do you know all that?
I'm on the internet.
Ha ha!
I'm keeping those for myself.
Man: My folks used to get really mad
because I'd just talk about it
and talk about it
and talk about it all the time,
Ioving all the wonderful
Star Trek stuff,
and here am I now, 27 years old,
and I still collect all these things,
and I love it just as much.
The super phaser
target game--
This was pretty hip
for the early seventies.
Star Trek: The Motion Picture--
the pop-up book.
These were the hottest thing
when I was a kid.
Taco Bell was running
this special,
and these are Star Trek
1984 drinking glasses,
and in 1989, they came out
with Star Trek V,
and they had this special offer
where you could send
for your futuristic
marshmallow dispenser.
So I went ahead,
and I sent for this thing,
and here we go.
It's still intact.
It's, like, mint in a bag.
All this stuff has, like,
overtaken my house in such a big way.
One of my goals is to actually build,
like, a great big shelf
where I could actually
display it.
That would be
kind of neat.
Woman: When we first started
doing the Star Trek cruises,
the fans came because they wanted
to have quality time with the stars.
Each fan has their picture taken
with all of the stars
and Star Trek guest celebrities
around them.
- Crosby: Tell me about the passport.
- It looks like a U.S. passport,
but obviously it says
United Federation of Planets,
and we filled it out.
It's sort of a thing you pick up
at the conventions.
I went to Honduras and Belize,
and they just stamped me in.
In fact, I even have one...
scary--
U.S. Immigration.
February 7, 1994,
they stamped me in.
Man: Coming is Jimmy Doohan's--
Scotty's director's chair.
My wife is flying in
with that today, and--
And that will be for sale?
Y es. That's for sale.
Here's the sign. We have the sign,
but we don't have the chair.
- And that's worth what?
- $375.
- Wow.
I don't know
if it's worth that.
We put a price on it.
We hope it's worth that.
I don't know. It's hard to put a price
on something like that, though, really.
It's probably worth
a million dollars.
Whatever you collect, you can
usually find it at conventions.
At a typical convention, you'll find
a plethora of dealer tables
selling a variety
of Star Trek merchandise.
Over here we have some
gorgeous cardboard stand-ups.
I really must pick up
one of these.
A nice collection
of the various novels.
And there is a set of the figures
right there I just traded.
Star Trek ship diagrams
and blueprints,
Star Trek- related
bookmarks,
Star Trek- related jewelry,
and Star Trek
uniform adornments,
Star Trek software,
plates, CDs, lithographs,
calendars, phasers,
a good deal of the model kits.
I always love buying
and building the model kits.
I've just been putting
the finishing touches
on Voyager here.
Of course, the Nacelles fold,
as you see on the series.
One little problem here
is this is coming apart there.
I don't think the Voyager is supposed
to have saucer sep capability.
I became a dealer because
when I was younger,
I read a few too many
Conan books,
and I started to get interested
in swords and armor
and learned how to make armor
and got interested
in weaponries.
And then we went to gun shows, and we
used to carry the armor on the table.
Then in about 1991, they came out with
the 25th anniversary Star Trek cards,
and I got all excited and went down
and bought a few too many boxes
and broke them all for sets,
and I got my sets, and then
I had all these sets left over.
So we took them to the gun show,
and I put them next to the armor,
and then all of them
disappeared.
And then they started asking me
for one of these and one of those.
And the armor started moving farther
and farther off the edge of the table,
and now it's on the floor,
and these and those have
taken over everything.
I'm working now with a company
that is doing cookie jars.
They're 30th anniversary
Star Trek cookie jars.
I've collected 759 autographs
in about 5 years--
of the Star Trek characters.
This is going to be
kind of like Christmas,
ripping open
all these packages and stuff.
She just got me
hooked on the cards.
I've just become addicted.
I told you, all you have to do
is buy one pack.
You just buy one pack,
and you're automatically addicted.
I've been in printing
now for 11 years.
I work in the bindery department.
Woman: A lot of people
do think she's strange,
and they'll say, "What kind
of person is she really?"
And honestly, she's very
well-educated and intelligent.
She takes her job responsibilities
very seriously.
She's a good worker.
But I think a lot of people think
she's not very intelligent,
whereas, really, she is.
Man: Bobby is
a little bit eccentric,
but it's a good quality
kind of eccentricity.
The customers do think it's
a little bit strange sometimes,
but they get a kick out of it.
Everyone's got their quirks,
and we just
work around and with those.
When I first came
into the shop,
I was going around meeting everyone
and getting names,
and I got to Bobby, and they said,
"This is the commander."
Commander, do we have enough
of that 80-pound rich gloss
for Tippen's calendar?
Going to be about 35. OK.
Y eah.
Thank you.
Man: Commander.
Y es? Which job is that?
Woman: When she first came to work here
and I called her "girlfriend,"
she made some comment that
she didn't really like that,
and I said, "What would you
prefer I call you?"
I said, "My rank is commander.
I'm a lieutenant commander."
She said, "Oh! Commander.
That's what I'll call you."
When I asked her why,
she started telling me all about this
Star Trek that she was into big time,
and she was commander
of some spaceship here locally.
Crosby: Did she explain what
these things were that she was wearing?
Woman: Y es,
but don't ask me what they are.
One's a phaser,
and it beams her up,
and the other's
something else.
I've never gotten any negative
response from it,
and some of our customers, especially
since the trial, I think recognize me,
but they don't usually
say anything.
Has it encouraged you
to watch Star Trek some more?
Actually, yes.
I seldom ever watch Star Trek.
Only because you want
to understand what I'm talking about.
Yeah. Some of it.
And I'm really not a Star Trek fan,
but I get into it
because she's into it.
In my favorite fan letter,
I received--
I opened it up, and there was
a marijuana cigarette
glued to a piece of cardboard
and a photo of a very
delightful-looking young girl.
And she said, "You have
turned me on so many times,
I thought I would return
the favor."
I kept that one.
I've saved some pretty great stuff
the fans have sent me.
These are ink drawings--
Chekov, Captain Picard,
Saavik, Dr. Crusher.
A woman named Jean Kluge,
she drew me in a kind of
Davy Crockett motif.
This is from Blowing Rock,
North Carolina.
Tasha and Sela together again.
This is a kind of
King Arthur- Knights
of the Round Table motif.
Sela, looking tough.
A lot of times,
kids send me things.
Nice lucite box
they sent it to me in.
This is Tasha
done in needlepoint.
It is, I think, my favorite.
This is a very imaginative pose.
At first, I've got to tell you,
I was actually shocked,
and then I kind of really
have grown to appreciate it.
Spiner: What was weird to me
when I saw the first one
was not just how they got
my naked body perfect--
I mean, it was just
a perfect rendition--
but yours was almost specific.
I mean, it--
[Crosby Giggling]
Are you filming?
Star Trek is unique in that
we are the only television show
that has an open-script
submission policy.
We will take scripts
from anyone in the world.
I once had a fan come in dressed
in a Starfleet uniform,
who was calling himself
Ensign Jones,
and all of his stories,
of course, had to do with
Ensign Jones taking control
of the Enterprise,
or Ensign Jones goes
to the Klingon home world,
or, you know, stuff like that--
Ensign Jones
travels through time.
I write in the original
Trek genre,
involving the characters
of Kirk and Spock.
I write slash
that appears on the internet.
You're talking
about the K/S zines.
The Kirk/Spock fetish groups.
The term means one character
with another, like Kirk "slash" Spock.
We thought that either Gene or
the studio would put a stop to it,
but the studio never really
seemed to care
because we're talking
very small circulations.
We're all very normal ladies--
mostly housewives.
Who want to read sexual
stories about Kirk and Spock
but don't want to see them
with other women.
The mailing list I'm on
is completely anonymous.
Why is it important
that your identity not be revealed?
Because of the controversial nature.
We're living in a culture
that isn't as progressive,
so it's important
to avoid censure.
I write The Secret Logs
of Mistress Janeway.
This is a story
about Mistress Janeway
and how she ties up Ensign Kim
and beats Tuvok
with a riding crop.
That was rather interesting.
A fan made this.
He sculpted out of
an X-Men figure, repainted it--
complete with a whip,
cat-o'-nine-tails, handcuffs.
Man: Another fan wrote
a Klingon sex manual.
"There's no such thing
as safe sex in Klingon,
how to tell if your daughter
is seeing a Klingon,
meeting your Klingon,
initiating the mating ritual."
Worf and I went up,
and I pushed him,
he pushed me back.
We started wrestling.
And it's understood that
that is part of the Klingon culture.
The female pushing a man
or slapping a man is considered like,
"Hey, I want to go out with you.
I find you attractive."
Uh!
I don't have it with me
anymore-- I threw it away--
but they had made from latex
a Klingon condom.
It was ridged.
It had like big ridges and stuff.
There are now thousands
of K/S zines out there.
It's way too late to stop it.
My name is Daryl Frazetti,
this is Bones,
and we've gone to about a dozen
Star Trek conventions together.
I do that with him
mainly because he enters
the costume contests,
and it's something fun
for both of us to do together.
We have a lot of fun doing it
with the people we meet.
He's got his little med kit
right here--his props.
this is the original
Trek scrub top,
and this is the science insignia
and his DeForest Kelley pin
that he always wears for luck.
We're probably bigger
classic Trek fans
than any of the other shows,
and DeForest Kelley happens
to be our favorite actor.
He will sit there
and watch television.
Some cats will sit there
and watch television.
Some of them actually
even respond to the phasers
or some of the ships
going by on the screen, as well.
We're here for this convention,
and we're old friends
who met because of Star Trek,
and we're having
a 13-year reunion.
First time we've been together--
the 4 of us-- in 13 years.
We're so divergent in personality,
in backgrounds,
in our family styles
and everything,
and yet, we have
this common thread of Star Trek,
which keeps us together.
Remember when-- the first
convention we went to,
we'd forgotten what it was like.
And we were at the convention,
and we were all accepted.
And when we left and we went back home,
we had to act normal again.
[Laughter]
I think if there's one thing
in this world
that I will take to my grave
with me forever is the fans.
They are so loving, and they are
so warm, and they are so tender,
and if you go someplace,
like into a convention,
and you don't have
any friends there,
you don't know anybody there,
you really do
because they're all thinking--
somewhere along the line,
they're thinking like you are.
My family thinks
I'm the odd one of the family.
They think I'm totally weird,
but I found this club,
and I found out
I'm not the only one,
so I guess I'm not so weird
after all.
It's really great
to go to a convention,
and it's like a family reunion.
My wife is here,
and she and I met, actually,
in a Star Trek club.
I know a lot of people from around
the state that I would have never met
unless I joined this club.
So it's meeting people.
It's about people.
What we do is we usually
set up a recruiting table
so that we can get new members
to join the organization.
Recruitment happens
every waking moment.
Every time you see one of us
either in uniform
or out on the street,
if our mouth is open and breath
comes forth, we're recruiting.
Woman: We belong to two
international fan clubs--
the United Federation
of Planets lnternational
and the Romulan Star Empire.
I am Linda Thuringer.
I am the captain,
and my Romulan name
is Efa Tilavet,
and I am the commander of the Praetorian
Guard for the Romulan Star Empire.
Steve Menaugh.
I'm the first officer, and my
Romulan name is Menhaltra Laheron,
and I'm the subcommander
of the Praetorian Guard.
I am the security chief
for the Nemesis station,
and I'm also a member
of Romulan Star Empire.
My name is Terry Stenoe.
I'm the chief medical officer
on the Nemesis station.
Woman: I thought at first that
I was a little afraid to come
to my first meeting,
But it was just a lot of fun.
But the thing is about
this group is that it is unique.
I think people are really
educated that are in this group.
They know a lot about science,
they know a lot about
what's going on in the world,
and it's neat
to be with people like that.
I think it's really fun
because you can--
because it's the only place
that I can think of
that you can goof off,
and grownups goof off
the same way
and about the same
acceptance.
Are you a Trekkie?
Totally.
How do you say "Trekkie"?
Lengwi' is a Trekkie.
Lengwi'.
Lengwi' jih
means "I'm a Trekkie."
"I'm a traveler" is really
what that means, but close enough.
Are you a Trekkie?
Yeah, I'd say I am.
I am a Trekkie.
Not card-carrying.
I'm not the kind that wears
uniforms all the time.
He is a card-carrying Trekkie.
He has a credit card
that says Star Trek on it.
At times, I'm a Trekkie,
and other times, I'm a Trekker.
Every serious fan
considers themself a Trekker.
Trekkie versus Trekker.
I don't even know
what that is.
It's a generational-type thing.
The Trekkie is the-- either saw
old Star Trek when it first came out
or started in with the reruns
early in the seventies.
The Trekker is primarily someone who
started in with Next Generation or lV.
Trekkers seem to be,
like, snobs.
"I'm not a Trekkie,
I'm a Trekker."
"Trekker" sounds a little pretentious,
but at least it's preferable.
A Trekker is, in fact,
a star-trekker.
They are walking with us, right?
The Trekker is motivated.
The Trekker is in motion.
The Trekkie is a sort of
neutral, benign, harmless viewer
who just wants to watch.
I am a Trekkie.
Actually, we're called Trekkens,
but, yeah, I am a Trekkie.
Are we going to take a trek?
We're not a couple
of Trekkies, right?
Then we're watching the trek.
But the Trekker, then,
is coming with us.
Denis: A Trekker is
somebody who enjoys Star Trek.
They probably have
a small collection at home.
They're really into it,
they go to Star Trek conventions,
and sometimes they'll dress up
and things like that.
A Trekkie, they live their life
according to Star Trek laws.
I myself prefer "Trekker,"
but I'm not quite
as adamant about it
as some of the other
fans out there.
I don't really like
the Trekkie/Trekker labels
because there's so much negative
connotations associated with that.
You say, "I'm a Trekker,"
and then people just start making
all the rude comments, et cetera,
so I'd rather be known
as a Spiner femme.
I usually just refer to myself
as a Star Trek fan
and just forget about this whole
Trekkie/Trekker debacle.
I met William Shatner the first time
on the Tonight Show.
I was fortunate enough to get
the name of the casting director,
and I sent her a package
and found out
that within a couple weeks
after I sent that package
that he was due to be a guest.
They wanted me to come on
and do a quick spot with him,
which we did,
and it was great fun.
he was a perfect
gentleman to me.
My name is James Kirk.
I changed my name because
ever since I was little,
I always wanted to change my name to
something I would enjoy, I would like,
something more befitting
my character.
I've had a lot of ridicule,
but I've had a lot of positive.
A lot of people go, "l wish I had
the guts to do something like that
or change it to something
I would be pleased with."
I go, "You can. You can do
anything you want in life."
I am with the starship Riverside
from Riverside, lowa.
It's a small town that's become
famous because in the movies,
Kirk actually
says he's from lowa.
About approximately
12 years ago,
Riverside proclaimed the right
to be the future birthplace
of Captain James T. Kirk,
and so far, it's been a big boon
to the town.
We have our Star Trek fest
the last Saturday of every June.
We get anywhere from 3,000
to maybe 6,000 people to town.
We have a parade, a carnival,
a contest.
It's just really a boon
to the town.
[Applause And Cheering]
Jimmy, my boy, Jimmy!
Happy birthday!
Man: We've been having
this party now for years.
It seems like every year,
it gets to be a little bit more fun
and a couple more people come.
You know, it started off small,
and now the younger
people are coming,
and this year, we had a girl
come and everything,
so, you know, I just foresee it
going on and on.
Man: It's just kind of a fun
bonding thing we do out here.
Every year, I whip up my
world-famous Romulan concoction.
I won't reveal the ingredients.
Man: You know, I like the Vulcan.
The Vulcan's a very logical person.
That's why I like Spock,
and he's very logical,
and with the conventions that we go to,
there's a lot of Klingons.
And being a Vulcan, it's kind of nice
to kind of stand out in that way,
and, you know, the Vulcans are obviously
a lot smarter than the Klingons as well.
Man: I drove down
from Calgary today
to take a look
at the starship Enterprise,
The model that we have here
in Vulcan, Alberta.
I'm really impressed with
the beautiful job they've done on it,
and I think it's really great
that here in Canada,
the town of Vulcan has adopted
the Star Trek theme.
Man: We really enjoy
having people
from all over the world to talk with and
share with us their stories of Star Trek
and the things that
they've been involved with.
Woman: I'm visiting Vulcan today
because of the Star Trek convention.
Obviously,
it's a Vulcan community.
My heroes are Spock and Tuvok
and Spock's father.
Man: Some people have fake
or phony Spock ears,
but I have the real thing.
It's been a--as you can imagine,
30 years of amazing experiences,
one after another.
I was at a party once many years ago
that Paramount was giving,
a big promotional party
for a number of their movies,
and all of the stars of these various
films were there, and I was invited.
The place was packed with
people, and it was in New Y ork,
and I felt a pair of hands
on my shoulder.
And, um...somebody
whispered into my ear and said,
"l recognize you.
You had your ears fixed."
And it was John Wayne.
Everybody was doing ear jokes
in those days.
I got a kick out of that.
It was fun.
There is a great deal
of my personality
that is Mr. Spock.
I try to function on logic
and intelligence
and not get carried away
with emotion.
I do consider myself,
as I say, half Vulcan.
I did draw the line, though,
at having my ears
surgically altered to points.
It was just too expensive.
But I'll tell you
the real truth.
I...
If I had the money,
I would do it.
I don't march
to the regular drummer.
You would go through the pain
of having your ears surgically altered?
Yeah. I really would.
And it's not so much...
Yeah. I really would.
I like to be different,
and this is a unique way
of being different,
and it's a noninvasive,
nonharmful way
of being different.
And even if I have
pointed ears,
I can still function in the world
in whatever I do.
It just makes me
that much more different,
and I would think
in a positive way.
But I don't think I'll be out,
you know, getting it tomorrow.
I would hope
he couldn't find a doctor
who'd be willing
to do that, personally.
This is Computer.
This is-- Hi, Computer.
This is my dog.
All the stuff that Star Trek
predicted is all coming true.
The talking computers--
I mean, computers are better now
than they were
in the original series.
There are people that are intrigued by
the speculative technology on Star Trek.
You know, my buddies would have
Cheryl Tiegs, Freddie Mercury,
Farrah Fawcett posters
in their bedroom.
I had the blueprints
for the Enterprise.
I started to build this--Nomad.
This is from the episode
"The Changeling,"
where the--it's going to--
The computer robot is going to
sterilize the Enterprise and destroy it.
One of my other projects
is the Romulan cloaking device.
I've started it here,
as you can see.
This is the main
power generator unit.
This is the--the round part here
of the actual cloaking device,
and I think I can modify it just like
they did in "The Enterprise lncident."
I can modify it for use
on a Federation ship.
I mean, I've built
a lot of stuff, you know,
Iike a communicator, phaser.
The best one, the one
that's the coolest,
is the chair that Captain Pike
was in after he was crippled
from radiation burns.
This is Captain Pike's total
life support unit, as you can see.
It encompasses the entire body
except for the head,
and it supports life and takes him
wherever he needs to go.
The beautiful simplicity
of the way it works
is that you can ask him
a yes or no question,
kind of like a binary computer,
and for yes, it's one blink,
and for no, it's two blinks.
So if you ask me any question,
I can just answer with a yes or a...
no, just like that.
It's motorized,
so I drive it around.
I drive it in parades and stuff.
Hi. Is Craig around?
I think he set aside some
stuff for me, some parts--
an H.P. 12-volt unit
and some transistors and a relay.
I talked to Craig
about my Nomad project,
and he, um, he said I could
maybe use the 3.9 ohm resistors
or the 270s.
Do you think I could get away
with it with the 270s?
For my next project, I'm going
to build a dilithium chamber
after I'm done with Nomad,
and I'm going to build
some antigravs, too, after that.
Maybe an M-5 computer.
And I'm going to connect
my house with Jefferies tubes.
I got a lot of projects, like,
down the road to do, to build.
Star Trek, I think, has had
a lot of impact on the future.
I mean, we have
cellular flip phones.
They have nuclear-powered
rocket engines already that will
I'm sure take us to Mars,
and basically, all
science fiction now is true.
Star Trek has always been
a real fun part of my life.
As a matter of fact, it was
one of the big motivators for me
going to the Air Force Academy.
It encouraged me
to go out and study,
and being that Star Trek
took place in space,
it turned my interest towards
things of a space nature,
such as astronomy
and astrophysics.
As a result, I got both my bachelor's
and my master's in astronomy,
and I now work as a data analyst
for the Hubble Space Telescope
Science lnstitute.
I really liked Spock's mind,
his logical mind,
and that pushed me
into a logical field.
Or at least, it helped push me
into a logical field,
which is computer science.
It's unbelievable.
Crosby:
Oh, absolutely.
It has had
such an effect,
just from an educational
angle alone.
Oh, it's--it's affected,
I mean, all of us.
All the actors have
received so much mail.
I get a lot of mail
from parents who tell me,
"We really appreciate
what you did
because you provided a positive
role model for our son."
I very much support the future
that Gene projected
as far as
an elimination of hunger
and elimination of poverty.
I think that Star Trek has
a really, really neat message.
The whole infinite diversity
in infinite combinations
is something that's very
attractive to all of us,
and it's something that I wish
the world would grasp onto
as beautifully as
the Star Trek fans have.
People of all races, religions,
political backgrounds,
sizes, shapes, et cetera,
are all absolutely equal
at a convention,
and nobody is ostracized
because they're different.
I think that attracts
a lot of people
because elsewhere
in their lives,
they don't have
that kind of freedom.
Well, this weekend
was great
because I got to
go to the convention
and pick up some great stuff
at the dealer tables
and meet some of my favorite cast
members from the series
and get their
signature and...
Talking to them,
shaking their hand
is just the most wonderful thing
you can ever imagine.
Well, I also got to meet
a lot of other fans
very similar to myself,
and, uh, they're great,
gorgeous people
who really know how
to place Star Trek
in the proper context
with the rest of their lives,
and that's a unique
gift for fans.
I met a very
wonderfully talented lady
who was a political cartoonist,
an English lady named Sue Coe.
But when she saw Star Trek...
it gave her a vision,
not of a world, necessarily,
that she could live in,
but it gave her a vision that--
it gave her an understanding
that there were people who
were thinking those thoughts,
the people who were
making the show.
The reason most of the people
I know like Star Trek
is it expresses issues that
can't normally be expressed
in today's society without
somebody coming down on you
or looking at you funny
or hauling you off.
My father grew up
in, um, in the Nazi era.
He was in Poland
when it was taken over,
and because he was a German citizen, or
considered German, they were protected.
When they came
to the United States,
he came to realize that the principles
that he grew up with were wrong,
and when we watched Star Trek,
he would tell me,
"The things that they're doing there
is the right thing to think."
The right things, you know, like
treating people like they're equals
and treating people
with respect.
I would love to believe that
everybody can get along in the future.
We struck a note, a chord,
with the youth of this country,
and particularly those who came back
from Vietnam and the hippies.
Plus the fact it came
at a very turbulent time
when the future
of society, the planet,
everything was up for grabs.
Nobody knew where we were going.
For the first time,
people--on television,
people saw themselves...
men and women, as equals.
I think I like the hope
and the chances it gives people.
Especially gay men
and lesbian women,
they're living in a world
and a society that's not accepting.
There's a dream that
one day down the road,
there will be acceptance.
I think Gene Roddenberry,
at that time,
offered a vision of hope
and that we would have a future.
Not only did we not annihilate
ourselves on this planet,
but we are going forth.
What progress!
With a sense of adventure.
Gene said not only
there is going to be a tomorrow,
but it's going to be a better,
kinder, more gentle world tomorrow.
And he liked to talk about
the things that bug us today,
which was back in the sixties,
and put them in some kind
of a disguised form
because of course, the network
would never let us talk about
things that were political
or war or stuff like this.
We couldn't mention
the black/white problem,
so you know what happened--
We painted Frank Gorshin
half-black and half-white
and his adversary was half-white
and half-black.
We set them at each other,
and it looked so ridiculous up on screen
that everybody had to look at it
and say, "Hey, we get this."
I think this is going to be
my basic prediction here,
that Star Trek will become
the blueprint for the 21st century.
The philosophy, the ideals,
the prime directive--
they're all going to be a genetic map
for a better future,
a better tomorrow,
for better mankind.
My feeling is that
we've had a great time.
We've had 30 years.
There have been tribulations and trials
as well as triumphs,
but, you know, the consensus
is of a very positive nature.
I don't want to be
one of those people
who's still talking about it
20 years--
Well, it is. It's 30 years
after the fact.
God almighty.
I am one of those people!
Oh, my God! No!
We would do these conventions.
We'd say,
"Well, it will probably last another
couple of years and that'll be it,"
you know.
10 years later, we're saying,
"Well, it'll probably last
another couple of years."
20 years later, we're saying, "Good God,
it's going to go on forever."
I don't think that
it will ever die.
I don't think that something
like that can ever die.
You've got a phenomenon. After all,
this is our 20th century mythology.
That's big.
I don't know.
I hope it lasts forever.
It's a good thing.
It's--It's, um...
As long as it's thoughtful,
it's a good thing.
And remember,
live long and prosper.
Man: Good night,
everyone.
Good night, all.
God bless.
I want to thank all of you
for my stamp,
And I want you to know
I'm a Trekkie, too.
I love Star Trek,
and all I can say is this...
& Glory, glory, hallelujah &
& Star Trek's truth
is marching on &
& lts truth is marching &
Ladies and gentlemen,
live long and prosper.
Uh-huh.
& On &
Thank you. Hah!
Thank you.
I am a big Star Trek fan
and got beat up most of my life
for being a Star Trek fan,
usually by sports fans,
which I think is ironic, 'cause, um...
someone that's, like,
really into football
will wear the uniform
of the game, a jersey,
and walk around town,
and that's fine.
Yet if I put on my Klingon uniform
and go to Safeway,
I'm a big f--king geek,
you know.
"Excuse me. These yams
have no honor."
I love their motto-- We boldly go
where no man has gone before.
But when they get there,
there's someone waiting for them.
James Kirk as an archaeologist.
Bones!
You know, there's supposed to be
this prime directive,
you don't tamper with cultures
because you're so advanced.
When you land on their planet, you don't
mess with any of their beliefs.
You just get that one thing
you need and you beam out.
He didn't pay attention
to that at all, man.
He would just burst into their
hallway, "Your bible is a lie!
Everything you believe is wrong.
Run! Freak out!
I'm the bloated God-being
from the sky."
They've always got one minority
that gets beamed down
that don't come back up.
It's like, "OK. Jim, Spock,
Bones, Scotty...
and Rodriguez."
Rodriguez is dead.
When they get down there, Jim goes,
"Rodriguez, check behind that rock.
Regular cast, stand over here...
'cause there's a brain-sucking
plant behind the rock."
We want Rodriguez to say,
"Hey, Jim, you check behind that rock.
I lost two cousins
on this show last season."
Remember the old one with the 3 brains
in the jars with the gambling problem?
Remember that? "l bet 400 quatloos
on the newcomer."
"Where are you from?"
"Earth."
"What's the spread
on the UCLA game?
Got a lot of quatloos on that."
One day you'll have Klingon comics.
Worf as a comic.
[Deep Voice]
"Thank you.
It's a pleasure to be here
at the first ice house on Klingon.
Remember when you were in school,
and your teacher would anger you,
forcing you to kill him?"
[Laughter]
"My father would be so proud of me,
he'd hold my hands
in the flames of Roqah."
"Scotty! How are the engines?
And don't use a metaphor."
"Aye, sir. The circuit board
is cross-wired
Iike a Christmas tree
on the Fourth of July."
"No, Scotty!
The engines, Scotty.
How are the engines?"
"Aye. They're overheated, sir,
like a supernova in the middle of August
with the windows closed."
"No, Scotty, no metaphors!"
"Can I use a simile, sir?"
"No!"
"An allegory?"
"No!"
"Can I tell an anecdote?"
"The Klingons are here!"
Weinhold: Remember Wesley,
the little kid?
14 years old,
he's never kissed anyone.
There's a holodeck
on the ship.
Now...if I had a holodeck...
when I was 14,
I never would have
left the thing.
They'd have to send
Captain Picard looking for me.
"Where's Weinhold?"
"He's in Holodeck One."
The doors open up,
I'm climbing out of a giant --.
[Laughter]
"It's time you saw
Counselor Troi."
"This is Counselor Troi!"
