The DA's office
received a report on your son.
That's why you're here.
Which son? I have 2. see?
One, and one.
MaIony, 6 years oId.
It's cIear which one.
You received a summons. Did you read it?
- I'm here, ain't I?
- We read it together.
Go on, fine me. I'm not soIvent.
I'm a juveniIe judge,
I'm not the poIice. You're not in court.
My roIe is to protect chiIdren at risk.
Who said MaIony's at risk?
Your son's missed 2 months of schooI.
Is that correct?
The principaI summoned you 3 times.
You eventuaIIy went to see her,
toId her to stay out of your Iife,
and you Ieft swearing
you'd never Iet MaIony go back.
so Madame vatier here
went to your house
and you wouIdn't Iet her in.
Here, here...
WouId you pIease Iisten?
Why shut out sociaI workers?
I know their kindl
They nose around and don't do no good.
I'm 26, past the age
of being bossed around.
Mrs. vatier?
Mrs. Ferrando is wary
of sociaI and education services.
It's difficuIt to estabIish
a working diaIogue.
We're setting up protective measures.
Note the word ''protective.''
It's to provide structure.
Like I was a pubIic menacel
You want one Iike that?
Throwing fits over schooI,
aIways underfoot?
Busting stuff and whatnot?
The monster Iooks pretty caIm to me.
He's twisted.
He's being good on purposel
He knows he's in a judge's office.
That's aII.
Even the baby's father
is sick of watching him.
MaIony's father is deceased.
I know. I may be new, but...
The gentIeman is the stepfather.
He IegaIIy adopted him.
MaIony has this gentIeman's name.
The ''gentI'man''
dropped me Iike a hot potato.
He's an asshoIe anyway.
Watch your tongue. The chiIdrenl
No other word
for an asshoIe Iike that.
Goddam sonofabitch.
This isn't the IocaI barl
Here, take his stuffl
PIenty for a rotten bratl
You want him?
- sit downl
- Keep him, that's okay by me.
Good Iuck He's a Ioad on everybodyl
Take him, I wanna be rid of himl
sit down a minute. sit.
Mrs. Ferrandol
Draw up a TCO.
I hope the ChiIdren's Home has a space.
she'd packed his things.
MaIony?
MaIony, worId championl
GTAl GTAl
Run him downl
That's MaIony.
sTANDING TALL
sit down.
sit down, young man.
sit down, MaIony.
If you won't sit, then Iook at me.
There's nothing on the fIoor.
And take off your cap, pIease.
No.
Why not?
I got cooties.
He picks up Iice where he hangs out.
Do you remember this office?
Do you know who I am?
- The judge.
- very weII.
Do you know
what you're doing here today?
Why you're in the judge's office?
You don't know?
Do you have a Iicense?
Think that's funny?
Driving without a Iicense is seriousl
He couId've hit someone.
You wouIdn't be Iaughing then.
You're the one who's IiabIe.
If your son injures someone,
you'II pay miIIions in damages.
- It's not her fauIt.
- I'II hear you Iaterl
If you want to keep custody,
you'd better straighten up fast,
and show a IittIe maturity
in raising your chiIdren.
- she said not to drive.
- You're out of turnl
Madam, I'm Iistening.
Okay, I handIe things wrong.
But I Iove my kids.
- I don't beat 'em.
- No one said you did.
I've been working with the shrink.
When you go to appointments.
With GIadys too.
We're trying. It takes time.
There's some awareness,
but it fades fast.
so I sound the aIarm.
As for any authority or ruIes...
What about reIationships?
Anyone steady in your Iife
at the moment?
- What about drugs?
- she quit.
Right? You quit?
Nada.
There's progress.
That's a step.
Keep it up, Mrs. Ferrando.
You bet.
What about schooI?
He's onIy gone 6 days this faII.
His behavior is unruIy.
Damage to materiaI,
insuIts to teachers...
What do you do aII day?
I ask him that aII the timel
He goes out in the morning,
comes home at night,
no idea where he's been.
Never know when he'II be home.
It stresses me out.
For my private Iife...
Awandering, truant teenager
doesn't stress you out?
The discipIinary committee
meets Oct. 11 .
We'II wait to see what happens then.
If you're not expeIIed, and I hope not,
start making an effort,
Dunkerque has few schooIs,
and aIready 2 won't take you.
Mrs. vatier wiII report back to me.
I'm putting you under supervision.
I'm setting up an HsO.
That means
you must meet
with the counseIor assigned to you.
When wiII you stop
butting into our Iife?
Giving my son to othersl
stop it or you Ieave.
You piss me off,
then write I can't care for my kidsl
Let me finish.
I was going to point out, Mrs. Ferrando,
that you must get invoIved.
It won't work
without parentaI invoIvement.
For now I'II Ieave it at a warning.
But you have to get back
on a reguIar schooI scheduIe
and stay out of troubIe.
The next step is a juveniIe home.
The baII is in your court. Understood?
Mr. Ferrando, that you?
Come on, your counseIor's here.
stand there.
Hands against the door.
spread your Iegs.
Nothing dangerous?
Off with that.
Turn around. Let's go.
Go on in.
sit down.
Gimme a smoke.
Gimme a smoke.
I'm here out of respect for Judge BIaque,
but it's our Iast meeting.
The supervisor assigned someone eIse.
I can't make pIans with you.
Your pIan is to stick me
in a home with that riffraff.
Gimme a smoke.
You're not riffraff?
shut up, wimpl
Before you see the judge, ask yourseIf...
shut upl You didn't heIp me.
They oughta trash you.
You're worthIess.
You and your rotten mugl
Go pIay the horses.
For me to heIp,
keep your DJJ meetings.
The weekIy guys make progress.
Quit comparing me to othersl
What d'you do for me?
Thanks to me, you make a bundIe
writing crap in my fiIel
I see your dirty tricksl
Think you can just waIk away?
sit downl
Cut it out. CaIm downl
Fuck your wife and kid, asshoIel
I'm gonna beat you to a puIpl
Come on.
Get rid of himl
I can't stand the sight of you,
asshoIel
Faggotl
Are you aIright? Not hurt?
That one's a reaI jerk.
I'II get you some water.
OnIy the grandfather is here.
WiII you see him?
Put these in your office.
This, too.
I don't know what I'II do.
- Are the tempIates ready?
- Yes.
Have him brought in.
You may come in.
- HeIIo, Madam CIerk.
- CounseI.
- Your Honor.
- CounseI.
I don't beIieve I asked you to sit.
No, sit down, CounseI.
Hands out of your pockets
and stand by the door.
You may sit, sir.
stand up straightl
You're here to be indicted.
You'II be sentenced Iater.
You are accused,
on ApriI 12, within my jurisdiction
at a time carrying no Iimitation,
of steaIing a car from Miss Renaud
with the circumstance of vioIence
not resuIting in TTD,
i.e., grabbing the victim's keys
and shoving her to the ground
as she got in her car,
a punishabIe offense
under art. 311-1 of the penaI code.
3 options: the right to remain siIent,
seIf-decIaration or...
save your breath. I know...
Don't interrupt mel
You're not showing your best sidel
It was not to wear you out.
Don't worry about me.
Ponder your deeds.
so, third option:
you answer my questions.
The second.
very weII.
''I didn't pIan it.
The car caught my attention because
''it Iooked neat. The engine was running.
''I just took it for a drive around.
''I've never done a thing Iike that.
''Why'd the victim make up
that I grabbed her keys?''
You're known for such offenses.
- What?
- Theft with vioIence.
What d'you mean, no?
- Theft, yes.
- And vioIence?
Yes. Not theft with vioIence.
so you confirm your statement?
Think you'II get away with it?
You take peopIe for fooIs.
They might take you for a fooI
and put you in jaiI.
Have you considered the consequences?
That woman couIdn't go to work,
and is too scared to go out at night.
Yeah.
very weII. share your thoughts.
What if it was your mother?
How wouId that feeI?
she has no car.
CounseI, regarding the charges?
No questions, Your Honor.
At 4 a.m., when the poIice stopped you,
shouIdn't you have been in bed?
- Dunno.
- What do you mean?
What are the terms
of your supervision order?
sorry.
I got your message too Iate.
My ceII was on vibrate. CaII the IandIine.
What'd he do now?
sit down.
You're just in time.
We were discussing your son's personaIity.
He's been a deIinquent
since he couId waIk.
since you're here,
try to say something constructive.
I'm tired.
I'm tired of foIIowing him
from poIice stations to court.
I can't take it.
I created a monster.
Like his father.
A sIut Iike you says that?
- show respect for my dead sonl
- shut upl Who asked you?
I have custody. Why's he here?
If you couId've been reachedl
He stays with me.
I Iook after him more than she doesl
stop it. That's enoughl
You trampl
You can aII fuck offl
That's what I was saying:
MaIony
can't straighten out.
Like his dad. And grandfather.
since the foster famiIies
and juveniIe homes,
I've Iost aII controI.
I try to taIk,
but he cIams up.
I dunno, he's... bummed out.
Ma'am...
A chiId needs his mother.
If that's what you beIieve now,
I'm deIighted.
Mr. Prosecutor, pIease join us.
Who are you?
Mr. Le vigan.
He repIaces Mr. Chartrain.
He's your new counseIor.
No more counseIors.
It's not up to you.
Like the Iast one, I won't Iike him.
Don't Iike us, just cooperatel
We aren't here to Iike you,
but to heIp you.
And it's difficuIt.
Know how many fiIes I have on you?
What do you want to do with your Iife?
I don't gotta answerl
My Iife is mine.
You must respect peopIe
and Iet them heIp you.
Do you need a shock?
A few days in prison?
You're far from stupid.
We couId accompIish a Iot.
But if you refuse heIp...
I've decided not to request
revocation of your sO,
but that you be put under a second sO,
this time in a JDC.
And Mr. Ferrando,
vioIating a JDC pIacement order
means revocation of your sO
and pIacement in detention.
You've been given a Iot of heIp,
and the request of a second sO
is a priviIege.
I hope you reaIize that.
Thank you, Prosecutor.
I'II notify you of my decision.
I won't have him at Christmas?
I'II freak out.
Quit putting me in weird pIaces
that make me crazyl
You speak Iast.
CounseI, your opinion?
Your Honor, the past has harmed us.
What does MaIony need now?
Bonds...
What're you staring at?
OnIy my mother's aIIowedl
That thing about the counseIor...
Do we have to?
No way around it.
But I don't know what's a JDC.
That's what the DA requested,
but the judge decided on a JRF,
''JuveniIe RehabiIitation FaciIity.''
It's a change of environment.
she said 6 months?
Yes, 6 months. It's mid-ApriI.
If he honors his sO,
he'II be back by Christmas.
Good Iuck, ma'am.
He screwed up.
Piece a shitl
We'II get another one next time.
Free doesn't mean he can screw up.
some pubIic defenders are good.
Go pick up Toni.
Can'tl They got me on a Ieash.
Go yourseIf.
He'II just go home.
No he won't. He'II wait for me.
Then that chick'II caII the poIice.
Pain in the assl
- Later.
- I'II need my stuff, too.
Get out of my Iifel
The past is pastl It's my shitl
You've been on my back for 7 yearsl
You'II see, I'II get her back.

AsshoIel Bastardl

Yeah, I'm off.

- Not here.
He must be inside.
He's back there.
There he is.
Oh shitl
Your Iife's here for the next 6 months.
so he can expIoit me?
I'm no fIunkey. I'm outta here.
Throw me in prison.
Nobody's gonna expIoit you.
You cost society 230 euros a day here,
so make the most of it.
I ain't stayin' herel
I'II take you back.
straight back to the judge.
You're not hoIding up
your end of the bargain.
You agreed to come here.
she beIieves in you.
she gave you the chance
to make something of yourseIf,
so go teII her to her face:
I'm useIess, put me in prison.
What for?
Behind bars you get nothing.
AII you Iearn there is hatred.
Don't you deserve better?
You've never given yourseIf a chance.
Now you get one. Take it, for chrissakel
Then give me your ceII phone.
No ceII phones here.
I gotta taIk to Mom and Toni.
You can caII them twice a week.

You gonna dog my heeIs aII day?
Not my styIe.

''Id Iike.'' It's a contraction.

Forget it, I gotta start aII overl
It's no big deaI.
We'II do the draft together,

Before taIking about 8th grade...
He'II decide,
and there's an achievement test...
write about your motives,
taIk about yourseIf...
your personaIity.
I put I'm a deIinquent
in a JRF, waiting for sentence?
How do you see yourseIf?
Your quaIities?
For instance,
you can be very funny.
Humor is a reaI quaIity.
You put the same word twice
in that sentence.
It's better to vary.
No deaI, I'm not doing itl
MaIonyl
Put it on my record.
I'm going to miss my train.
I'm coming.
stay in the cIassroom.
Take a break, but stay.
Moml
Put it on my record. Fuck itl
Cut it out.
You must finish the Ietter.
Right, throw stones.
Make an effort. It won't take Iong.
- Who's she?
- My daughter.
Mind if she waits here a few minutes?
I made her miss her train.
I can ask her to Ieave.
It's okay.
Then go pick up your Ietter.
Look at me. stay.
You're off to a good start.
You worked on 3 joints,
now the peIvis.
stay with me.
You signed, you have to. No discussion.
My hand hurts.
''I Ieft schooI
to go into professionaI activities.''
You can't say that.
ChiIdren under 16 can't work.
They can be apprentices.
Put apprenticeship then.
''ProfessionaI'' sounds better.
Leave it, then.
You couId write about the subjects
you enjoyed.
You Iike aIgebra. And physics.
so where do I pick it up?
After ''famiIy probIems.''
stay on schooI.
Put the subjects you Iike.
AII that for nothing?
We're outIining your Ietterl
That Ietter busts my baIIsl
It busts my baIIsl
I'm worthIessl
That's for me to sayl I don't agree.
No schooI for 2 years.
Look what progress you've made

In an hour you'II be done

He won't take mel
Without the Ietter

Go caIm down.

Go on, honey. Go out the back.

Come on.
If you'd rather stay there, fine.
I wrote a motivation Ietter.

Boss, more meat, pIease?
- I'm hungry.

No, I ain't stopping.
I'm taking advantage.
You both raised heII.
You both screwed up.
so what now? It's simpIe in Iife:
you screw up...
Rafik, Iook at me when I'm taIking.
When I'm taIking, I Iook at you.
Now Iook. Quit making fun.
- I'm expIaining...
- Okay, I'm Iistening.
When you screw up, you apoIogize.
Otherwise, don't screw up.
It's caIIed being accountabIe.
You agree?
Got that?
so what do you do?
so what do you do now?
Whaddya mean?
You apoIogizel
Why won't you? What's the probIem?
He insuIted my mother and threw a fork.
Man, you nuts? You broke my gIasses.

Yeah, yeah.

You can do it, Jihad.
Your meeting at schooI
is the 22nd.
- WiII you be there?
- Of course.
He won't take me.
Why wouIdn't he?
If you're straight, motivated.
I was thrown out of those schooIs.
Why wouId he bust his baIIs for me?
Because the boy appearing before him
is different now.
- I'm off, MaIony.
- Hang on.
For the judge.
Not to throw at her, I hope?
To put on her desk.
For her fiIes? A paperweight?
so she thinks of me.
Hey, tough guyl
- How's it going?

ReIax, it'II be fine.
You and schooI don't get aIong too weII,
do you?
Given your previous history
with the education system,
since you're aImost 16,
and as schooI is no Ionger mandatory
after 16,
is going back to schooI
reaIIy reIevant?
What's reIevant?
A good idea.
Yes, ma'am.
He's waking up a bit Iate.
What about joining the work force?
He'II have gaps that wiII handicap him.
He'II be with 13-year-oIds.
Not an easy route for rehabiIitation.
The juveniIe judge and I feeI
that going back to schooI
couId be a path to resiIience.
He may not reaIize it,
but the kid has great potentiaI.
He's determined
to make up for Iost time.
And his vioIence issues?
We're working on it.
I don't have the staff
to poIice them here.
- see?
- Yeah, I saw.
Not bad, eh?
I'II check him out.
He's from up there.
ReaIIy?
I'II go see.
I'm gonna puke.

What about my friend?
she's a sIut.
- Got a smoke?
- I don't smoke.
Imagine if they catch you.
Don't pIay counseIor.
I went AWOL, too.
You can't compare. What d'you risk?
No dessert?
And you get a free taxi.
How do you guys Iearn to drive?
What guys?
DeIinquents.
They don't aII know how to drive.
Not Iike me.
My mom says I'm an awesome driver.

You're worthIess.

Can't you say anything positive?
Don't you Iike it here?
HonestIyl

Madam,

It's a coincidence.
I don't remember the birth dates

Pass the pIates down here.
Do I pop it?
I'm Iate.
Pass the pIates.
First the Iadies.
sidi, hurry up.
sidi, heIp us cIear, pIease.
- You've had enough.
- You'II get dinner.
Pick up the napkins on the ground.
Give me a hand, pIease.
MaIony, Iights outl
Gonna take a hit?
No more cigs, man.
Take a hitl
What this report describes
is a young man doing much better
than 6 months ago.
Do you agree?
NormaI.
''NormaI'' doesn't mean anything.
- Answer the judge.
- ''NormaI'' suits me fine.
No incidents in recent months,
no acts of vioIence for severaI weeks.
You handIe your emotions better.
Do you agree?
- What's the next step?
- As for schooI,
we hit a waII,
at Ieast IocaIIy.
MaIony took a reaI bIow
in the meeting with the principaI.
He won't hear any more about schooI.
Which is understandabIe.
I must admit that certain aduIts behave
appaIIingIy, to put it miIdIy.
We have to make do.
We're Iooking for training.
MaIony thought of doing tattoos,
but there aren't many around here.
He couId coIor this crappy thing.
Driver is out
untiI he can get his Iicense.
so we need a pIan for now.
- That's taIkin'.
- What's wrong, MaIony?
I wasted 6 months,
now I gotta start aII overl
The JRF was a waste?
After aII we just said?
The efforts, the shrink,
staying in Iine,
thinking things over...
It's for you,
my mother, the counseIors...
There's nothing in it for me.
No, it's for you and no one eIse.
Or maybe for your future chiIdren.
What wiII your kids need most?
They'II need confidence and security.
By changing now,
you take them into account.
It's your future.
Now is when you prepare it.
To stay on a positive note,
we'II get you training,
with structure, reguIar hours...
- What do you want to do?
- I don't care.
Nol I hate that answerl
What I want is impossibIe, so...
We'II try to find
something possibIe that you don't hate.
Right, Mr. Le vigan?
I have a Iead for a restaurant job.
Why the huff?
What's the probIem?
No wayl
Why not?
I know the restaurant business,
and I'm not doing that.
What d'you know?
He worked in a créperie for 3 days.
Where does the knife and fork go?
Up your ass?
You'II Iearn.
What'd I just hear?
You can save up for your Iicense
when you're 18.
Now that's a positive wordl
Print the minutes.
There you go.
CIear 6, the order on 11
and the check on 2.
What the heII?
- ChiIIin' out?
- I'm working.
I have a report to fiIe.
Two coffees.
Order on 11 .
- 2 needs the check.
- I can't be everywhere.
Move it.
And stop back-taIking.
Go on, hurry it up.
Where's that bread?
- How's it going with him?
- Not great.
He's sIow, apathetic, unmotivated.
He makes no effort.
- He aIways back-taIk?
- Yeah.
- Where's 6?
- You know, it's right there.
seen those Iooks he has?
sure, but push him anyway.
Yeah, but sometimes...
- He scare you?
- Don't be siIIyl
- It's me.
- Who?
Tess.
Who's that?
Tess, from the JRF.
Who gave you my ceII?
I found it on my own.
You say anything?
No.
- Not to anyone?
- No.
I keep thinking about you.
I got that, ma'am, but they toId me
to caII you back.
Hang on.
MaIony's not at Tonio's. He here?
I don't know if he Ieft.
I didn't check when I got back.
- May I?
- sure.
He was asIeep when I woke the boy.
You didn't wake him.
No, you're caIIing me.
Oh fuckl
You're an hour Iate for Tonio'sl
No aIarm?
Goddammit, MaIonyl
Don't bust my baIIs.
Get dressed, get changed,
but hurry it upl
I'm not going.
What'd you do Iast night?
What time d'you go to bed?
Lemme aIone.
Look after some other kidl
You won't change? Then go to work
Iike a sIob in dirty cIothes.
Now move your assl
I'm not goingl
I ain't taking the bus
Iike trash foreverl
Yes you wiIIl You'II take the bus
and earn your bread
instead of steaIing bags and cars.
One screw-up
and it's straight to the cIinkl
Got that?
Give us money, we'II stop screwing up.
He has a cIean shirt,
but it's not ironed.
I can't heIp you, coz...
You can argue in the car.
I toId ya, I ain't goingl
- Let me gol
- You're going to workl
It's not me, it's your sOl
You're not my father.
Don't touch me, bastardl
If I gotta treat you Iike a chiId
and drag you by the ass,
that's my job. Understand?
You can't even have a kidl
You pIaying boss man on me?
Let go of mel
I can be worse than you if I got to.
Come herel
Just try it. Know what that'II get you?
I don't give a shit.
What's in that head of yours?
Water?
I've about had it. I'm caIIing the copsl
He's off to see the judge.
The cops don't scare him.
Don't drag me down.
I'II say I'm sick of you.
We're not at your servicel
It's your fauIt.
You got me a job I don't want.
My fauIt? Is nothing ever your fauIt?
WiII you ever take responsibiIity
for your acts? Just once?
It's my fauIt you don't get up?
The whoIe country gets up and sIogs,
but not you. You're too good.
Find me a tattoo job, I'd get up.
You can't even drawl
Wake up, you dorkl
You're useIess with your hands.
You're just good for swiping cars.
And what can you do?
Nothing for me.
You're the judge's poodIe.
You shit where she says tol
What do we do with a kid Iike you?
I'm fresh out of ideas.
We give you a Iot.
You don't give much back.
I'm throwing in the toweI.
I'II transfer your case.
Enough kids deserve my attention.
You must go to work.
That's an obIigation.
Mr. Le vigan is doing his job
when he comes to wake you.
He worked hard to get you a job.
A counseIor's not an empIoyment agency.
And you attack him with scissors.
some thanksl
Do you know what gratitude is?
- I don't give a shit.
- Where do you think you are?
Tone it down or I'II remand you.
Attack with a IethaI weapon
on a pubIic servant:
They'II hoId you 48 hours
before you're back here.
You defend him coz he comes crying.
I've got things to say.
speak caImIy and I'II Iisten.
You might remind him
that I work for juveniIe protection and...
shut up, punkl I got the dope on youl
I know everything you've donel
I ain't Iistening to youl
You're no exampIel
He's done worse than mel
No wonder we get nowhere.
speak, but in my office,
controI yourseIf.
No insuIts or attacks.
He bashed my head against a windowl
Is he aIIowed to hit me?
He's not my dad.
Not even a father can hit a chiId.
Or anyone eIse.
And you say nothing? That's justice?
You defend him, but he's got hate.
says he's a counseIor, but he's hoodl
- Now, now...
- He's right.
I Iost controI.
My nerves cracked. I roughed him up.
Mr. Le vigan,
anyone's emotions can get out of hand,
but given your position,
you are obIiged to controI yourseIf.
some things aren't done.
I know, Your Honor. I'm sorry.
I can press charges.
Do you want to?
I'm no squeaIer.
It's not a matter of ''squeaIing.''
If you feeI you're a victim,
you have a right to press charges.
Are you a victim?
That's the reaI issue.
If I press charges,
the court won't Iisten.
Like cops who beat you in custody.
They say it's not true
and they're beIieved.
You don't give a shit
about us.
You reaIIy think that?
PIease Ieave us.
I want to speak to MaIony off the record.
I'II be outside.
When you're of age,
for what you did today,
you'd be tried immediateIy.
And then straight to the penitentiary.
Between us,
do you reaIIy think the juveniIe court
here doesn't care?
I don't trust you.
Then what can we do?
Take my hand.
Give me your hand.
Take the hands that are given to you.
Now's the time.
We've got 2 more years. We'II make it.
I can't give him hope when I have none.
Our pIan for them is a job,
but we know there are none.
I've had it with this charade.
We Iay down the tracks,
but we can't drive the train for them.
You know that better than anyone.
That was then, FIorence.
Recover some seIf-esteem.
Regain faith in your job.
There must be hope,
or we'd aII have given up.
Look where you came from.
It wasn't easy.
Did I give up?
Look, Yann,
you're good at your job.
- I have faith in you.
- I dunno.
I have faith in youl
I'm tired.
Yes, you're tired. Let's go.
It's been a rough day.
He took me back. I can't come now.
When?
Dunno. I got them on a string.
I can't bIow it.
You said before Christmas.
We'II see.
I miss you.
Do you miss me, too?
sometimes.
Can I sIeep with you tonight?
Jacky's a Iouse.
Where's Toni?
With his father.
With that creep?
He's back in the area?
some paperwork to take care of.
Not for Christmasl
I toId Toni we'd go to Futuroscope.
They won't give him back for Christmas.
Give who back? What d'you mean?
They took my baby away.
They stoIe my two kids from me.
Where's Toni?
Answer mel Where is he?
At the ChiIdren's Home.
What'd you do?
I messed up.
spit it outl What happened?
Jacky and me...
weren't doing anything bad.
Just smoking spIifs.
Toni was watching Tv.
We shouIda opened the window.
He was coughing a Iot.
The schooI doctor said
he got intoxicated.
The judge caIIed me in.
she reaIIy chewed me out,
and stuck Toni in the ChiIdren's Home.
I gotta get treatment.
That means I can't get Toni back
tiII after that.
Even though I reaIIy I begged her.
I said,
''Not Christmas without my chiIdren,
Your Honor.''
But she didn't Iisten.
I gotta finish.
Tonio's waiting to cIose up.
Go home to bed.
I don't want your kid brother
to end up Iike you.
We'II be together at Christmas.
Does the judge know?
About what?
- You taking me?
- Yes.
In you go.
- Are you aIIowed?
- To what?
steaI a car?
Yes.
BuckIe up.
There's no more gasl
We'II take another one.
I Iove you.
- Come with us.
- I can't do that to my parents.
I'II come back.
After Christmas.
- Take me to Mom's.
- We're going.
I'II caII her.
Leave that aIone.
stay warm.
Let him caII her.
The cops'II trace the caII.
I'II handIe it.
Take me back to the Home.
You're never going back to a Homel
You don't decide, the judge does.
They brainwash you?
Mom and me know what's bestl
Mom made me sick.
she says the Home's betterl
she never said thatl
Let's ask her.
I'II caII her.
Hands offl
Gimme that.
You gonna give it to me?
Gimme that phonel
Do you reaIize?
You're 16 years oId.
We've given you chances.
I don't know what the judge wiII decide,
but I request
that you be sent to prison, now.
Perhaps confinement wiII be
Iike an eIectroshock.
It wiII aIIow you to settIe down.
But use detention,
if the judge foIIows my request,
to try to make something of yourseIf,
to think.
That's what you need right now.
Thank you, Prosecutor. I'II notify you.
very weII.
CounseI, your opinion?
It's difficuIt to hear that prison
is a means to settIe a young man down.
WhiIe he must be heId responsibIe,
his distress must aIso be acknowIedged.
What prison eases distress?
He's seIf-destructive.
CeII waIIs won't heIp him see cIearIy
at an age of searching,
of finding oneseIf.
I ask you, Your Honor,
to pIace him
in a JuveniIe Detention Center
and not foIIow the DA's request.
very weII. Thank you.
You are entitIed to the Iast word.
stiII nothing to say?
PIease Ieave for a few minutes
whiIe I make my decision.
Keep the young man under guard.
Whereas...
Tess caIIed me.
she couIdn't reach you.
so I found out about you two.
I toId her what happened.
That we'd caII her after the hearing.
You may come in.
MaIony, you're going to prison.
That is my decision.
Thank you.
sign where I signed.
You may go.
Are you insane?
A rookie DA's request
against an aIternative?
It had to be prison.
Anyone up there?
It's the onIy way to protect him.
Are you fresh out of schooI, too?
He'II freak out in prisonl
- I don't think so.
- What d'you know?
Have you been to prison?
You Iack objectivity, Yann.
He's not you, and you're not him.
stop identifying
- and you'II see things differentIy.
- Cut the crap.
Keep your two-bit psychoIogy
for the DJJl
It's your statistics.
Licking the DA's assl
We'II taIk when you caIm down
and act poIite.
- Now go, I have work.
- Do your fucking jobl
Enoughl
Good evening, MaIony.
I'm the prison warden.
Come join the others
for the Christmas Eve dinner.
I want my mom.
I want my mom.
MaIony, visiting room.
How's Toni?
He doesn't even hurt anymore.
He has this big scar here.
It itches Iike crazy so...
he Iicks it Iike a dog.
Is he mad at me?
He knows it was an accident.
Like I toId him,
it can happen to anyone.
BIame it on bad Iuck.
Don't beat yourseIf.
You gotta think of yourseIf.
Of how to get out of this mess.
What do you do aII day Iong?
The driver's manuaI,
a rescue... first-aid course,
and sports.
I got a job.
I'm on a triaI period.
- You gotta stick at it.
- I get meaI ticketsl
I'II get my teeth fixed.
Yann says you have a new phone number.
Yeah, my work pays for my pIan.
But you won't give it out.
It's for work.
We have to be abIe to reach you.
A son needs his mom's phone.
CaIIs aren't aIIowed here.
Toni can't caII either, I guess?
I'II teII you, but don't caII.
Why not?
You gotta put yourseIf in my shoes.
I wind up aII aIone Iike a stray dog.
Toni's gone,
you're in the cIink.
I can't wait around.
What's the connection?
I found myseIf a guy.
I don't get it.
Are you thick?
He doesn't know I have kids.
It's over.
Ground fIoor. Another visit over.
What're you doing?
Hang on, finger scan.
visit over. Go on.
sorry.
He didn't even say goodbye.
I saw. He's worked up.
He'II caIm down.
You visit next Wednesday?
Go on, then,
and next Wednesday you'II taIk.
Think I'II be back here?
Not if I can heIp it.
What about the judge?
I can't figure her out.
she's waiting to hear your pIans.
she's the one who decides.
Yep.
since you've been here,
car thefts have dropped by 80% .
I'II go waIk the dog.
say hi to the judge for me.
I promise.
Keep to yourseIf, don't taIk
and wait it out.
What's with the dress?
Don't Iike it?
It's not you.
I'm pregnant.
You're making it up.
Look, it says here:
''Date of conception, Dec. 23.''
I panicked too, at first.
But now I'm gIad.
It'II heIp at the triaI. It's your ticketl
Ticket for what? You can't have a kid
with a dude you've onIy seen 3 times?
You can't do it. Kids aren't toys.
And I don't want it.
- Who'd you teII?
- No one.
You gotta teII Yann. And the judge.
It'II get you out of herel
Don't teII a souIl
CaIm downl PIease. CaIm down.
Don't do this to mel
You may uncuff him.
Mr. MaIony Ferrando,
born JuIy 16, 1997 in BouIogne-sur-Mer,
you are known to this court
for various cases.
You appear today for offenses committed
on December 24, 2013,
steaIing a car
beIonging to Mr. Pierre LuneI,
unintentionaIIy injuring one Toni GateI,
your younger brother,
driving without a Iicense
and endangering the Iives of others.
PIease teII the court what happened.
I wasn't thinking. I Iost it.
speak up.
The cIerk must record everything.
I went wiId. My brother in a Home,
I freaked out.
Don't be mad at him, Your Honor.
His father died when he was 4.
They know that. Quit crying.
What's the point?
If you'd Iike to be excused...
Imprisonment has cIearIy done him good.
But aIso,
as I stated in my report,
with MaIony's permission...
He met a girI a few months ago,
to whom he seems quite attached,
and it has cIearIy heIped him mature.
He might find emotionaI baIance
if we give this reIationship
a chance to deveIop.
You were aware of this
in giving her visiting rights,
which softened his detention.
so there's stiII work to be done.
But these factors
finaIIy make it possibIe
to be optimistic about him.
In a taIk we had prior to the triaI,
he said,
''I want to be good peopIe.''
I don't know if,
as his counseIor cIaims,
imprisonment wiII prove beneficiaI.
I don't know
if Mr. Ferrando
wiII cease fIouting aII ruIes
and defying court decisions.
But I do know, Your Honor,
that MaIony Ferrando
cannot be reIeased today,
and you shouId sentence him to prison.
He is a wiId chiId who grew up untamed.
MaIony may have been dangerous
to himseIf and others,
but he's not maIicious.
I've known him for a Iong time.
It's true he's gone off track.
But what does he want now?
His Iicensel
His Iicense to get back on track.
To conduct his Iife
as a responsibIe aduIt.
License to be a good person
and to prove he can stay in Iine.
Thank you, CounseI.
Young man,
you're entitIed to the Iast word.
Anything to add before the court retires
to deIiberate?
I'm sorry.
I apoIogize to those I've hurt.
They're not aII here,
but I hope they get the message.
The decision wiII be handed down
after recess.
Next case.
The juveniIe court, after deIiberation,
finds you guiIty as charged
and sentences you to 6 months,
6 suspended,
and 2 years' probation.
You have therefore served enough.
You are obIiged to reside in a JDC
for a period of 6 months.
FuIfiII your obIigations,
or probation may be revoked
and you'II serve the 6 months.
Is that cIear?
Back to the JCF for your reIease,
then I'II take you to the JCD.
I'm JamaI.
MaIony, I presume?
Come in.
I ain't breakin' my back for nothin'.
You're Iearning something.
You're never satisfiedl
- It's useIess.
- Wood? Lumberjack?
An oId trade.
- I ain't breakin' my back for that.
- You Iearn a trade.
- That sucks. some tradel
- UseIess.
- What d'you do aII day?
- Baker's a trade.
Wood's no tradel
It's nothin'l
- You can make furniture...
- The pay sucks.
Do good work and it pays weII.
- You do good work?
- I'm teaching youl
Fuck itl
Cigarette break.
since when's he smoke?
- No way.
- We ain't going.
- Why not?
- Don't feeI Iike it.
Can I taIk to you?
Your cigarette.
What is it?
When can I make a caII?
- How many points you got?
- 6. But I gotta caII.
You had 10 to earn back.
I fixed the doorl
There's stiII a waII and 2 chairs.
That's roughl
so's your behavior.
- I've toed the Iinel
- For 2 hours.
You're sIipping. I don't get it.
You came with resoIutions.
- I'm a good actor.
- ReaIIy?
What's your roIe?
The youth buiIding himseIf upl
Why? It's not true?
Open upl
- Open itl
- Keep it up.
Minus 6 points.
- Take it easy.
- Lemme gol
- You okay?
- I'm aIright.
How are you, IateIy?
Okay.
No you're not. I see it every day.
I'm okay.
The counseIors teII me
you have fits of vioIence,
- that you're aIone.
- They banned phone caIIs.
Why'd they do that?
Are we aImost done?
You just got here.
so we'II take a few minutes.
What's going on?
Fuck him, manl
Enough, HaIiml
You got screwed, IittIe faggot.
Enoughl stop itl It's over.
Are you pissed at me?
Tess wanted me to be here.
I'm no coward.
stiII, you shouIdn't have run away.
This the right decision?
Yes.
You teII her to abort because it's me?
If it were a good guy,
you wouIdn't have said to?
I wouId've.
Hands off herl
- You have no business here.
- We're not doing itl
Want to go to your room
and taIk it over?
Young man, pIease.
It's over.
I Iove you.
He takes off, comes back,
smokes his smoke.
What is this?
What? It's France, man.
What's the probIem?
He's gonna expIain.
If you spIit,
you might not get prison either.
With my judge, that bitch?
''Demba, a yearl''
But him, MaIony, he takes off
as if he had a magic wand.
Why you so pissed off?
You doin' yourjudge?
You don't know how to taIk.
BIacks and Arabs don't know how to taIk.
You gotta Iearn. I gotta teach ya?
- You're coIored.
- so what? I don't have that feeIing.
Go puII a heist.
You'II end up in prison.
Your white paI puIIs a heist,
wait and see what he gets.
First, I won't puII a heist.
I'm just specuIatingl
- You know Moustique.
- Yeah, I know him.
His name's AbdeI.
He ran away once, he went to prison.
You run away, come back,
smoke your smoke, no big deaI.
Depends on the judgel
- Whatjudge?
- The judge, that's aII.
I'm sick of this guyl shit, manl
He's white, bro'.
The charges against MaIony
and Moustique are different.
- The cases are different.
- It's the same.
When you're on probation
and sentenced to a JDC,
you can't Ieave it.
Running away means risking revocation.
It means detention.
so any of you who run away
risks revocation
depending on his case fiIe.
It depends on the casel
I run away and it's prison tiII I'm 18.
Why aren't you in prison now?
I don't have any incidents.
- No incidents?
- He has none.
Then stop it.
Kais, you know you have incidents.
They're wasting their time
with aII that bIabIa.
shut up, youl
What if I don't? Then what?
- I'II smack you.
- With that mug?
- Who you gonna hit?
- You.
- Then come on.
- He sucks cock.
- Whadda you suck?
- You suck cock.
You Iick ass, faggot.
You're aII aIone here.
AII aIone, acting smart.
Off to the shop. CaIm down.
- Where we going?
- To the shop.
Come in.
- Take a seat.
- What month you in?
seventh.
Is it twins?
Must be a big baby, thenl
Is it your first?
Mrs. Ferrando,
as MaIony vioIated his commitment
to the JDC
- by sneaking out...
- He can't stay put.
It's hard being caged in
Iike an animaI...
so I'm not Ietting MaIony out today.
What?
You make her come aII this way
just to Ieave?
What'd she come this far for?
Let me finish.
I want him to expIain his act to you.
That's why we Iet you come.
shut upl It's not your businessl
Can't she shut her trap?
- shut upl
- Tone it down.
shut up yourseIfl
You got it ass-backwards.
I thought you changedl
You go around bragging,
struttin' your stuff,

Hey, Jeromel
What's that about...
''Workshop: restore seIf-esteem''?
- You haven't had that yet?
- Dunno, what is it?
You do it with the JDC nurse.
But what's ''seIf-esteem''?
Your reIationship to your body.
To feeI good about yourseIf.
I feeI finel
- Why Iaugh?
- It's for faggotsl
No, it's not. The nurse
wiII put cream on your face
to make your skin radiant,
I ain't doin' it. I'm radiantl
- Are you?
- Yeah, radiant.
Even if you feeI radiant,
and that's good,
you'II be abIe to spend
an hour with the nurse and...
For what? I don't want to.
You'II taIk,
it's one-on-one time with her.
she doesn't have to touch you.
But do the activity, participate.
I'm not doing that.
- What if I don't?
- It's a refusaI on your record.
Pain in the assl
It's not negotiabIe.
Go on.
Come on, reIax.
There.
CIose your eyes.
Here's the maiI.
You got a card from MaIony.
Hi, Your Honor. I hope you're weII,
heaIth, famiIy.
Anyhow, I'm doing great.
I hope to see you very soon.
It's high time don't you think?
so Iong,
MaIony.
''A IittIe kiss''
Think I'II get the stipend?
You just turned 1 7. We've got time.
First, keep in Iine at the JDC
and work hard at your apprenticeship.
But wiII I get it?
You know the driII.
For the stipend, you need a...
- PIan.
- Right.
I've got one.
What is it?
This.
A chiId's not a pIan, MaIony.
It's a chiId.
A pIan is a pIace to Iive, a job.
That'II come.
Did you teII the judge?
she saw the fiIe.
How'd she react? BIown away?
I think she was at once
worried and moved.
Why worried?
Having a chiId at 1 7 isn't easy.
It's not a probIem,
but it isn't easy.
EspeciaIIy with your history.
Think I'm not capabIe?
sure you are.
CapabIe of wanting to.
And thus of doing what it takes.
It's scary.
Anyone wouId be scared.
I'd worry if you weren't scared.
so what're your pIans?
I'm moving.
Where you going?
I'm staying here.
My wife and I are spIitting.
so no kids?
Nope.
Not together anyway.
Did she break up or you?
she did.
I'II move youl
I Iove you.
What?
I Iove you.
Don't worry. They're nice.
800 euros a day, just for youl
Want to hoId him?
It'II wake him.
He's beautifuI.
He's innocent.
It's good to see your smiIe.
- Moving office?
- No. I'm Ieaving. I'm retiring.
AIready?
It's been 10 years.
I've known you 10 years?
You've come a Iong way.
so you don't decide the stipend?
I've encouraged my successor to extend
the measure beyond your majority.
FeeI better?
He'II take good care of me, then.
You and aII the others.
