My father always told me that he wouldn't
be around forever to protect me.
He was an outlaw.
And he knew his days were numbered.
He told me that the only person
I could ever rely on was myself.
And even that person
may let you down.
My father taught me how
to fight. To survive.
To never be a victim.
To never cry.
Because those tears would
be used against me.
Come on.
And when he was killed,
I never cried. Never.
Not once.
I want you to be happy, but it
doesn't hurt to be cautious.
It's not like you are high
school sweethearts, okay?
You guys met at a needle
exchange, for Christ's sake.
It was Narcotics Anonymous,
and she is the reason
that I am still clean.
Yes, and I appreciate that,
but there are still
a lot of unknowns.
Which has a habit of
repeating itself...
My brother's a lucky man.
My dad always said
consistent luck is skill.
Well, then my brother's
consistently lucky.
Pre-nups are the norm today, Derek.
Marriage is business.
If it goes south, you're
gonna need an exit strategy.
Ava already signed.
If you want to disown
or disinherit me,
please draw up the papers and
I will gladly sign them,
but I do not need an
exit or a strategy.
Now someone out there I
should introduce myself to?
Any family, friends?
That's okay, you've got us now.
We're your family.
Please be seated.
Derek and Ava have arrived
at this very special
moment in their lives.
I Derek...
I Derek...
Take you, Ava...
Take you, Ava...
to be my wife.
To be my wife.
- Oh, my God.
- She's freaking out.
- Freaking out.
- I'm not freaking out.
My grandfather, he bought this
back in the '40s for nothing.
And we used to come here in
the summer when we were kids.
But now, my dad thinks
it's too rustic
and he'll only stay
at the Four Seasons.
What do you think?
It's amazing.
Right there, that is my
grandmother on her wedding day.
And this here, that's my uncle,
and my mom
when she was two or
three years old.
You know, this is the first time
that I've actually been
here since she died.
She would've loved you.
I wish I could've met her.
Yeah.
Whoa.
Why aren't I driving?
I should be the driver!
Whoo!
What are you thinking?
I think I'm supposed
to be asking you that.
Typically, yeah, but...
Oh, my gosh!
Hello.
May I?
What's your name?
- Ricardo.
- Ricardo?
You're handsome.
It looks good on you.
It works.
You think so?
Hello. Hello.
Oh, oh, he wants his daddy back.
And we'll take him.
Come on.
Come on, little one.
You will be a great mother.
You think so?
Oh, I know so.
I didn't really have
the best influence.
Yeah, well, you know, we both got
an education in how not
to raise your kids.
So...
El baño.
I have to go to the bathroom.
That's Spanish for...
You learn something new every day.
All right, I'll be right back.
Give me a little kiss.
Do not go anywhere.
Stay right there.
Do not move.
Hola, como está?
Bien.
Manny.
Ava.
Nice to meet you, Ava.
It's a beautiful,
the view, isn't it?
It's gorgeous.
Where you from?
Connecticut.
Do you know Earl Sanders?
Mmm...
ah, I don't think so.
Well, he comes here every year.
He's from Connecticut.
Oh.
Connecticut is kind
of a large space.
I have family in Texas.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Okay, not that close, but okay.
Babe, this is Manny.
He has family in Texas.
Hey, man, what's up?
Wow, what's up?
- All good. All good.
- Good.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
So how much longer are you
guys on the island for?
A few more days.
And nights.
Have you been to Cabarete?
Uh, I don't think so.
Oh, it's a beautiful,
beautiful place.
The longest zip lines
in the Caribbean.
- And the rain forest.
- No.
I'm afraid of heights.
- That sounds awesome.
- Oh, come on.
My friend runs the place. I
can take you guys tomorrow.
And it's a very safe place.
- Only one person died there last year.
- Only one person!
Relax. I'm joking.
I'm joking.
How about dancing?
You guys like dancing?
Ooh, I prefer zip-lining, but...
I love dancing, but this one...
I can't dance.
Well, my friend, my friend runs
the hottest club in
the entire island.
We can go there.
I don't care.
I'd love to.
- Well, we can do both things.
- You'd love to?
Yeah.
I'll tell you what I'd love to do.
We don't drink!
Salud!
All right, all right.
Ease up on the hands there, chief.
It's all right, babe.
Come back to me, babe.
Okay.
Hey, forget that gringo,
you're dancing with me.
Relax, man.
This is my girl, all right?
Tranquilo! Come on!
Take it easy.
You little bitch!
Fuck!
Ava, it's me!
Babe, we gotta go now!
Come on, come on, come on!
All right, babe.
You're all right.
Let's go.
Let's go, Manny!
Come on, man!
All right, babe, come here.
Get in.
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go.
I'm fucking tired of this shit!
I was just dancing with
that chava, that's all.
Yo, what the hell?
I guess we're not going to
that club tomorrow night, huh?
You know that man that
you just messed with?
That's Big Biz, dude.
That was fucking bad!
Oh, my, dude.
I better watch out for you, girl.
You went crazy!
Like fucking ninja, fucking crazy!
Manny! Manny!
Let it go.
Drop it.
What the hell was that?
Sorry.
Best piece of advice I ever got?
Don't trust anybody.
You whoring like your old man?
Hmm?
I got no problem with 15.
I like 15.
Sometimes, the only way
to defend yourself
is to attack!
Hold her down!
You just wanna be harder,
quicker, faster,
dirtier than the next
guy, you understand?
Ahh! Fucking bitch!
Eventually, you forget
about the pain,
forget about the fear,
you remember the lesson.
You understand me?
Too slow!
Most people have a limit
they won't go beyond.
You're gonna learn to go beyond.
You're gonna learn to
go beyond the limit.
You fucking bitch!
You fucking bitch!
Somebody's gonna put you down...
you put them in the ground.
What time is it?
I don't know.
My God...
All right. I'll get it.
Coming! Coming!
Manny?
Hi. Please open the door, man.
- Yo.
- What?
Big Biz from last night, he's
on his way over with his boys,
and he's not coming to apologize.
How could they possibly
know where we're staying?
I don't know.
Maybe the taxi driver
told him or something.
Just get your shit on,
we're out of here.
Seriously?
Where the hell are we
gonna go, man? Huh?
Estoy jodiendo, man.
I'm just fucking with you.
That's not cool.
Not cool.
I just had to get you guys up
so we can get to the
zipline in time.
Come on!
No, I'm not going.
No, when did we even agree to that?
Safest place for you guys to be.
We have to go, 'cause
if we get there late,
Jojo, the guy from the
zipline, is gonna leave us.
- All right.
- No.
- Next!
- You're next. You're next.
Come on!
- Oh, God.
- All right, babe.
Oh, God.
You got it. It's all good.
Will you make sure this is...
Yeah, everything's good, here.
All right.
Just in case I don't see you again.
Don't say that!
Lower the glove there, okay?
Lean back and enjoy the ride.
There you go.
Oh, my God!
Lean back!
Lean back!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, man!
You're here! You're here!
You're here!
Yeah.
Bring it down, bring it down.
Wow.
Do it, man!
Whoa!
Ah! Ha, ha, ha.
Yeah, bro!
That was good.
How was that, man?
How do you feel?
That was awesome.
- Oh, man,
- It was awesome.
You have not seen anything yet.
What do you mean?
Where we're gonna go now is
the real deal.  El Viudador.
Wait, what does that mean?
"The Widow Maker."
The widow maker.
So here we are!
El Viudador!
Check this out.
- Oh, my God.
- It's amazing, isn't it?
Oh, I... I don't
think I can do this.
The longest zipline
in the Caribbean.
I can't do this, babe.
Don't, please.
Like seriously you can't?
I don't think so.
Just sit back, enjoy
the ride, okay.
Let's do it.
- So I'm the only one going?
- Yeah.
Zoom in.
He's too far away.
One mile.
- A whole mile?
- A whole mile.
Oh, God.
Wow.
Okay.
All right.
Ready?
There you...
Oh, boy!
Oh, no.
Oh, my God!
Whoo-hoo!
I married a lunatic.
Oh.
Hello!
Wow!
Ah-ha-ha!
Whoo!
Whoa, whoa. No, no, no.
Stop.
Whoa.
Oh, fuck.
Fuck!
Get out there and help him.
Hold on, man!
- Hold on, man!
- Fuck!
Fuck!
I got you, man!
I got you!
Hey, hey,...
I got a handle.
Big cojones is what
you got, cabron.
Slowly let go of your legs, okay?
Let go, let go, okay.
Come on.
Help me.
Yeah, follow me.
Okay, one, two...
Okay, I got you,
I got you. Hold on.
Hold on, hold on.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
Hold on!
Hold on! Hold on.
I'm slipping!
Come on.
Wait, wait.
Give me your other hand.
Don't let go!
Call an ambulance.
Fuck!
Derek!
Derek!
Derek!
Oh, my God. Babe?
Derek? Derek?
Manny!
Manny, help!
- No, no.
- Whoa, whoa!
I'm going with my husband.
I'm going!
- I'm going with him!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
It's something about insurance.
That's ridiculous!
I can go with my husband.
Okay, where are you going?
Here.
It's the main hospital here.
It's good.
Go!
Go!
Move!
Where's Manny?
I don't know.
No, no.
I have to go to Centro Medico...
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
My husband came in
here, Derek Grant,
about 20 or 30 minutes
ago in an ambulance.
Can you check your charts?
No, no, no, I'm fine.
He's in much worse condition.
Please check a Derek
Grant for me, please?
No, no, no.
He's blond with blue eyes.
American.
You've reached Derek,
but guess what?
He's on his honeymoon.
You've reached Derek,
but guess what...
No Derek Grant.
Is this Centro Medico?
Are we here?
They brought him here.
The ambulance people
gave me this card.
My husband is here,
they dropped him off.
He got in an ambulance
and came here.
No Derek Grant here.
Is there another Centro Medico?
Señora!
Señora!
Please don't touch me.
Get your hands off me!
Please, ma'am!
Excuse me, ma'am.
Excuse me.
Estoy buscando a Derek Grant.
Here?
Can you check your charts?
This is him.
Is he here?
Did he come in here by ambulance?
No. No.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm looking for my husband.
This is what he looks like.
Ma'am, have you seen him?
Can you please help me?
Hello?
Oh, hi.
What's going on?
Has Derek called you?
No.
Why, what's wrong?
My husband is missing.
Ah, no English.
Do you speak English?
And she call hospital
for your husband, okay?
Quit moving.
You think you need my help, Ava?
Do you need anybody's help?
You don't.
The only person you can
rely on is your own self.
This will heal up.
Survivors have scars.
Losers have funerals.
Scars are what you want.
They're like tattoos.
But with better story, huh?
Ava, you are made with the
toughest stuff around.
Don't you forget that, all right?
Who called for the ambulance?
I'm not sure.
I think that his name is Jojo.
That's what Manny called him.
This Manny, he took
you to the zipline?
Yeah.
He's on the left.
Last name?
I don't know.
Where did you meet him?
At some restaurant on a beach.
Some restaurant on a beach?
Why didn't you ride in the
ambulance with your husband?
They wouldn't let me.
They wouldn't let you?
I...I think they said it was
because of some insurance problem.
But I tried.
Did they say where
they were taking him?
I already told you this.
Centro Medico Punta Cana.
Punta Cana.
Punta Cana?
Gracias.
There's no record
showing of your husband
being admitted into any clinic
or hospital on the island.
Maybe he decided to not go.
Okay, "Not go?"
He was unconscious and his
leg was completely sideways.
How the hell is he not going to go?
There's no activity
on his credit card.
No outgoing calls on his
phone, so it's either dead
or his battery has been taken
out so it can't be tracked.
Maybe the ambulance had
an accident on the way
to the hospital.
Maybe it fell into a ditch
and no one was able to
contact us or call.
Okay, I don't know, but we
need to be out of here,
out there looking for him.
Maybe we're not getting all
the information that we need.
What does that mean?
Was anyone drinking?
You know there wasn't any drinking.
I have a right to ask.
You already know the
answer to that.
Well there are many ambulance
companies on this island,
they're unregulated, so
it's highly competitive.
First one on the scene gets paid.
It's a wonderful island,
but with opportunistic
and dubious parties,
everybody's trying to make
a better standing for themselves.
Especially when it comes
at the expense of
wealthy Americans.
Then again, I could be wrong.
If he was kidnapped, we
should know something soon.
I'd say within the next 24 hours...
Oh, my gosh.
So what's our next step?
We were closed yesterday.
Actually, we're always
closed on Monday,
so there was no one here.
No, no, I was here.
I was here with my
husband, Manny and Jojo.
No, no, sorry.
We don't have any Manny
or Jojo working here.
Manny doesn't work here.
He said he was friends with the owner.
Actually, I'm the owner.
Okay, the name of the zipline
is called El Viudador.
No, no, we don't call any
of our lines El Viudador.
Are you sure it was here, because...
Yes, it was here.
Well, we have a
perfect safety record
and there are like four
other line operations
on the island which...
Look, it was here.
I remember the road in, I remember the
fire station, I remember all of this.
There's another zipline
about 30 minutes from here
with the same kind of rope and
it looks exactly the same.
Hey!
Wait.
Jojo, right?
You were here yesterday
when my husband fell
from the zipline, right?
This is Jojo.
No.
He says he doesn't
know who you are.
Why are you lying?
You called the ambulance.
Why are you lying?
Okay, hey.
We were here yesterday.
Admit that you were here.
Admit that you were here.
Let me handle this, okay?
Let me handle this.
Okay, look, maybe he thinks
he's getting in trouble.
Maybe he thinks you'll
get him trouble.
He got paid off.
I don't know.
Listen, you got to understand.
It wasn't here, okay?
You're scaring my customers.
Okay, look, let's go
back to my office.
- No.
- Let's talk about the next step.
- Get him back!
- No, no.
- We got to go.
- Please go!
We need to go.
Please, please.
Please, please, please.
That was him.
That was Jojo.
Fine, yes, we'll go back and
talk about it at the office.
We should get him, don't you think?
Everything okay?
Everything is safe.
You are going to enjoy,
enjoy yourself so far?
Have a seat.
Let's talk about Sunday night.
I got an e-mail sent to
me of a video footage
from Club La Zona.
And apparently you have a
really violent side to you.
You on drugs?
Because you nearly killed this guy.
I was defending myself.
Why didn't you say
anything about that?
Because I didn't see how this had got
anything to do with Derek's disappearance.
You sure about that?
Gracias.
So you got into a tangle
with a guy named Big Biz.
You know he makes people disappear.
Then why aren't you
interviewing him?
We will.
So how were you and your
husband getting along?
We're great.
I understand you're the main
beneficiary of all his assets.
I'm his wife.
What are these?
Sketches.
Why aren't they being distributed?
Because they look like
half the men on the island
and I have to appropriately
allocate my resources.
Yeah, what exactly are you
doing with your resources?
Right now?
If you're not going to look
for my husband, I will.
Let's go.
What happened?
Oh. Derek.
Derek, stop!
Stop!
Derek!
No, no.
Sorry.
Wrong car.
I'm gonna make some pasta.
Do you want some?
No, thanks.
Ava, you haven't eaten in two days.
Maybe just some water?
Derek Grant, who disappeared
three days ago.
The couple were on their honeymoon
on the island.
All previous leads
have been dismissed
as attempts to cash in
on the considerable reward money.
Did anyone call?
You're not really expecting
any calls, are you, Ava?
What?
What really happened?
What aren't you telling us?
You think there's something
I'm not telling you?
I think there's a great
deal you're not telling us.
Dad.
Maybe something went down at
that bar and Derek got killed.
Or maybe somebody
wanted to kill you
and killed him instead.
Or maybe you guys just kinda...
fell off the program and
things got violent.
I don't know.
But I do know that you are
the reason he's gone.
And I think you're trying
to tap into my finances.
I don't give a shit about
your finances, Mr. Grant.
I love your son.
I love him more than I loved
anything in my entire life,
and I always will.
Fuck you.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sorry.
Lady, you need to wait a minute.
She's going first.
Remember me?
Oh, shit.
Let's find some place
where we can have a talk.
No, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!
Fuck!
Shit!
No!
No!
No!
No, no!
Okay, Jojo, you're gonna start telling
me some information or you're gonna die.
Do you understand that?
Look at me!
What happened to my husband?
I don't know, lady!
You want to drop?
No! No!
Did you take me and
my husband ziplining?
Look at me!
Did you take me and
my husband ziplining?
Yeah!
Why did you lie to the cops about it?
I don't know.
Manny, Manny told us to...
be quiet.
Manny told us that they
were very dangerous.
Who was dangerous?
Who was dangerous?
I don't know. I don't know.
Listen, you want to
die, motherfucker?
No! No!
Okay, look at me.
Who called the ambulance?
Manny called. Manny
called the ambulance.
So he knows.
He knows everything, please.
Okay. Okay.
I have his number.
All right.
All right, what's his number?
It's 809-555-3210.
I tried the cell phone, it went
straight to the voicemail,
but it's definitely Manny's voice.
You believe me now?
Manny knows where Derek is.
We need to find Manny.
Let's go.
- Turn around.
- What?
Turn around.
Let's go find my husband!
Hey!
Maybe you can torture
people in America
to get a confession out
of them, but not here.
And I'm gonna let you leave
here with some dignity intact.
Officer Santos is gonna take
you back to Puerto Rico.
You are no longer
welcome on this island.
Do you understand that?
Excuse me, sir, I have
to go to the bathroom.
Are you gonna take
my handcuffs off?
Get in.
Well, you're gonna have to
come in here and help me.
Can you get me some tissue?
So my boyfriend thought
it would be funny to
throw me in the pool.
I'm going to kill him.
Are you alone?
Si.
Let's hope so.
Hello, Manny.
People don't just disappear.
No!
I'm here illegally.
I can't talk to the cops
or they'll send me back!
You're gonna wish
you were back home.
I swear!
I don't know anything
about your husband!
- Where's Derek?
- I don't know!
You called the ambulance.
I did!
But when I called, they
said that someone else
had already called in.
Who?
I don't know!
Who are these guys?
Who are your buddies?
What is that?
What is that?
It's a tattoo that one
of the paramedics had.
This guy has that tattoo.
That's their fucking neighborhood!
That's T.S.
They own that shit.
Everybody knows that.
Police, the politicians,
even the putas know that.
If you're fucking with me,
things are gonna get nasty.
Nastier than this shit?
You're not safe here.
Tell me something I don't know.
If you want me to
help you find Derek,
you have to deal with....
Let's go over here.
This is my room.
So you live with your mom.
I came over first...
and made enough money
to bring her over.
There's not enough work in the
island where we come from,
except for fucking drugs.
Tomorrow you're gonna take me to.
We're gonna work together
to find this guy.
They say that if a person isn't found within
the first few days, the likelihood...
Don't.
Please don't.
Just don't.
I'm sorry.
Derek is alive and I'm gonna do
whatever it takes to get him back.
You should probably
understand that.
I do.
So relax.
You should get some rest.
Get in there.
In this place, there's no law,
there's no mommy,
there's no daddy, okay?
Everything you see is
not really what it is.
Everybody here is trained
to be unwelcoming.
Yeah.
No.
No.
Yeah, everybody here
is off the grid.
They're either not from here
or they've been let go by everyone.
Stay, okay?
Hold on, hold on.
- What?
- That's it, that's it.
- What's what?
- Stop, go back, go back!
All right.
- What is it?
- Just stop.
That's it, that's it.
- What?
- That's his tattoo.
The paramedic, the one with gold
teeth, that is his tattoo. Look.
What's this?
That's when they do the
cock fights and stuff.
- I know where it is. Let's go.
- Okay.
- All right.
- Let's get out.
No, no, no.
Don't get out, okay?
Just give me the flyer.
Stay here.
Hey, where are you?
I found him.
I can't hear you!
What?
What the fuck, man!
You and your partner took my
husband in your ambulance.
Where did you take him?
I don't drive an ambulance.
My father was not a
well-educated man,
but he did know a little something
about the human anatomy.
He showed me where all
the vital organs are.
You have the wrong guy!
See, the tummy is squishy.
You've got the colon,
the small intestine.
It's the squishy stuff
that's hard to puncture.
Where is my husband?
I told you, I don't know anything!
Maybe I should just
go for your spleen.
But you can live without
your spleen, can't you?
Where's my husband?
I don't know.
Or I could go for your liver.
Puncturing it would
probably make you bleed out
in five or six minutes.
Okay, okay, okay!
Okay.
This girl was texting me.
I got dropped off!
I don't know what happened
after that, I swear!
Next day, Omar comes over
with a bunch of money.
He told me to quit my
job, not to say anything.
So I did it, okay?
I did!
You're looking for Omar, not me!
It's him you're
looking for, not me!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I'm texting your brother.
He'll fucking kill you!
You tried.
How'd that work out for you?
Timo?
Remember me?
I bet you do.
Now you're gonna tell
me where my husband is.
Where is my husband?
You break into someone's
house and assault them?
They have every right to use
deadly force to defend themselves.
Timo admitted to taking my
husband in an ambulance.
He's in on it.
I don't know.
He said he got paid.
Let her out.
Let's go.
I'll tell you what I think.
I think you paid those two guys,
who are really no choir
boys, to kill your husband.
And then you silenced them,
so that they wouldn't
implicate you.
You know, from the beginning,
the only violence and wrongdoing
that I've witnessed has been
perpetrated by you and only you.
You are being held for the
murder of Omar Tavarez
and the attempted
murder of Timo Tavarez.
And you are now officially
the prime suspect
in the disappearance and
probable murder of your husband.
So you know what?
A bath, a shower, and a lawyer.
Whatever order you want,
that's what you need.
Look, fine, take me, but
my husband's alive.
You need to find him.
He's still out there.
He's alive.
Taking you to headquarters
for further interrogation.
Please!
Please look at me!
My husband's alive!
Yeah, well, we're
gonna transfer you
over to headquarters
for the interrogation.
Derek's father and
sister have requested
that you be charged
with a capital offense.
Please find my husband for me.
Please, do your job.
Good luck.
My husband is alive.
We're not going to police
headquarters, are we?
Let's go.
No.
You know what that means.
Ava.
Why don't you come to
your daughter's room
and we can have a little talk.
Please, don't.
Shh!
Keep your voice down.
You don't want to
wake your daughter.
Gun.
Sit.
- My family.
- Your family?
Let's talk about your family.
What would you be willing to do?
Where would you be willing to go?
Look, it was me.
I did this.
You don't understand, I owe him.
Who?
Avilar.
The doctor from Villa
Jaragual Clinic.
Look, he did something
for me, okay?
She... She was too young,
and he just made sure
the family didn't find
out about her pregnancy.
I owe him everything.
If my wife and kids...
Yeah, you're a real family man.
I can see that.
Where's my husband?
The doctor, he made a mistake.
He tried to set his bone...
and he punctured his
femoral artery.
He tried to save him.
Look, he asked me...
he begged me to cover it up.
Otherwise, the American
would make sure
his clinic was finished.
He wanted to make it seem
like he never made it
to the clinic at all.
You've been lying to
me this whole time.
You knew my husband was dead?
And you tried to have me killed?
You need to go.
Please don't do this.
Not in front of my family
and my daughter, please.
I understand, okay?
I don't deserve to live.
I'm a bad man.
Please, not here.
You have two options.
One...
two.
One of these is quiet.
We can go to the bathroom.
I'll make sure your wife
finds you, not your kid.
What the hell happened to you?
He's gone.
He's gone.
Derek showed up,
when he could've...
He saved me.
He changed me.
You changed you.
He just gave you a reason.
I have to finish this.
"When all the bastards
are gone and dead,
only then rest your head."
That's cheery.
Where is that from?
I heard that every night
before I went to sleep.
That's a pretty shitty lullaby.
I can help you.
No, you can't.
I have to do this on my own.
What the hell happened
to your hand?
Shit.
You should go see a doctor.
I plan to.
First thing tomorrow.
Can you just please check
a Derek Grant for me?
Please.
No Derek Grant.
You have a limited
amount of oxygen,
so I want you to listen
to me carefully.
I want to know what
happened to my husband.
He is the American
with the broken leg.
I want to know how he died and
what happened to his body.
Are you ready to tell me
everything I need to know?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
I have no idea...
Really?
Derek Grant!
Garza, the little girl,
the pregnancy!
Please, I just need to know.
Fine. Fine.
You don't understand.
You don't know what...
Really, because I think
it's pretty fucking simple!
Wait.
Wait!
I think you're gonna find out
everything you ever wished to know.
Take a look.
Take a look.
You...
You told Garza he's dead.
No, wait.
I can help you.
You pull that trigger,
then your husband is
gonna be dead for sure.
Christie.
Christie.
Silvio Lugo.
What happened to your hand?
Got it caught in a door.
Stupid door.
- Right?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna need to search you.
Call me.
Hey, S, how you feeling, my man?
Huh?
Ready to give some of
that miracle milk?
You are my golden ticket.
Doc, what are you waiting for?
Some anesthesia.
No, no, no.
My man can handle it.
Can't you, Papi?
Yeah, fuck that.
Go.
That's it.
Get him all nice and clean.
But you're so cute, I don't care.
You can do anything you like.
That's it.
Show me, Doc.
It's okay, Papi.
You can handle it.
There you go.
There you go.
It's okay.
That's it.
You're doing a good job, bro.
Doing a great job.
That's it, Papa.
That's it.
Good boy.
That's a good boy.
Come on, Doc, give me that.
Yeah...
that's what I like to see.
A real fountain of life.
Thank you, Papi.
You trying to put me to sleep?
Doc, where'd you find this girl?
Nobody fucking move!
Put your fucking hands up!
Hey!
Hey!
Give me the gun.
Down.
Get the fuck down!
Who the fuck are you?
I'm his wife.
Oh.
So you're the girl my man here
has been speaking so highly of.
Who, who!
Was that necessary?
All this violence!
Seriously, we're all
helping each other here.
Your husband has been a
real life saver, you know?
I have this rare type of cancer.
Multiple myeloma.
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
And the only effective treatment are these
stem cell transfusions from bone marrow.
You know, I pay the
doctor here good money
But it ain't easy, is it, Doc?
Stay back!
Hey, listen, you need to
learn more Spanish, babe.
Listen, I can call some of my men,
the ones you haven't shot already,
and they can help you
find your way out.
I can find my own way out.
Are you sure?
It's a big building.
You know what?
Thank you, Christie, for
sharing your husband.
We're gonna get you
out of here, okay?
So...
what you been up to, huh?
I'm gonna need you
to help me, okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
You guys suck, motherfuckers.
Easy, easy.
Keep this on him.
You know, I can pay you
for what you've done.
I should've offered you money up
front, but people are so selfish
when it comes to donating
their body parts.
I just couldn't take the risk
when it's so hard to find
a bone marrow of a donor
who's tissue is a perfect match.
You know, with your
husband's bone marrow
and my strict diet...
Ah!
Bro, your girl hits hard.
Where you gonna run, little rabbit?
You realize you're on an island.
My island!
Things are gonna end up badly
for you guys, seriously.
Tell me, Derek, do you even know
how to use one of those things
Yeah, I do.
You two motherfuckers are crazy.
Do you see anyone?
Take the left!
Right there in the yellow dress.
Go left. Right there.
Got it.
All right.
Where's this next turn?
Right there, right
there, right there.
Pink shirt, next right.
Let's go.
Get out of the car.
Go, go.
I'm gonna find you!
Come on, come on,
let's go, let's go.
Come, come.
You've been shot, right?
- What?
- Come here.
You sit down. Damn it.
Shh.
We can't stay here.
It's not safe.
Where is safe?
You know what?
Come on.
You know, it didn't have to
go down like this, Mama.
You fucking bitch.
Come on, show me what you got.
Show me you got.
You wanna fuck with me?
Come on.
I hope you had a nice honeymoon.
Ava, don't do it!
We can't have tourists
being kidnapped
to prolong the life of
this piece of shit!
Give me the knife.
Give me the knife.
This doesn't concern you, cabrón.
 It does because it's my business!
What business?
Fucking putas
and gambling business?
Yes!
My putitas can't work
without tourists!
And we're gonna
gamble by ourselves?
Give me the knife.
Give me the knife.
Give it to me!
Aren't you dying?
Aren't you dying now?
Yeah.
Correction.
You're dead.
Let her go!
Let her go...
Derek!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Okay.
You!
It's time for you to go
home, where you belong!
My friend Carlos is gonna be
taking you to Puerto Rico.
Keep the shirt, bro.
Brought me good luck.
Thank you...
for everything.
Bye!
Come back soon!
