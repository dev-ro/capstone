The network headed by Anthony Zimmer
laundered huge sums of money,
perfectly legally.
He used various methods.
The most brilliant was
the phony lawsuit.
Phony lawsuit?
Imagine you have 15 million
in dirty money frozen
in a tax haven like Bermuda.
Zimmer's phony lawsuit gets it back
into France entirely legally.
Good afternoon.
What would you like?
No, I'm waiting for someone.
You just need two companies.
The first in Bermuda,
the second in France.
Your French company files a suit against
the Bermuda company.
It claims it hasn't delivered
a major order,
like tissues, for example.
To resolve their "differences",
the companies go
to an international tribunal.
The Bermuda company is found guilty,
and the French company
receives sizeable damages.
The money goes out
of one pocket and into another.
But now it's legal.
The man is brilliant.
He's a criminal who makes
a fortune smuggling drugs.
What do you consider a fortune?
Tens of millions of euros.
Pity you let him get away.
Him and his money.
Who were his clients?
They call themselves
the "White Collar Barons".
The most powerful mafia in Russia.
On this subject, Mr. Nassaev
should know more than I.
Like you, Mr Nassaev's
investigating Zimmer.
He's just an observer.
Let's get back to Zimmer.
Was he part of this mafia group?
He just worked for them.
He's not involved with them.
Why did someone like him get
into smuggling and laundering?
Love of money.
Love of risk.
He loves gambling,
being above the law.
You don't have a photo?
He's had major plastic surgery.
Now, he has a new face and voice.
If he were here now,
I wouldn't recognize him.
So you're not about to catch him.
We'll catch him sooner or later.
What makes you so sure?
I know his weakness.
They're following you...
Choose a man at random...
- Is this seat free?
- Be my guest.
I think I'll need your help.
May I help you?
My zipper's stuck.
I'm afraid I'll hurt you.
Don't be afraid.
Thanks.
I'd love some tea.
With milk.
How are you, Sir?
I'd like tea with milk
and a coffee.
Okay.
- How much is the meal?
- 7 euros 80.
I'll take one.
In case you're hungry...
I see.
Are you sick?
Just a nervous condition.
I like to know what I'm eating.
You'll make me paranoid.
- Just trying to guess who you are?
- Really?
Why?
It amuses me.
You know what they say...
about appearances.
What do they say?
Something like...
you can't trust them.
That's what they say.
Apparently, your name is
Fransois Taillandier.
You live at 18, rue Mouton Duvernet
in Paris.
Apparently, you're 39 years old.
38
Sorry.
May I?
Go ahead.
Apparently, you like detective stories.
And apparently,
you're going on holiday...
Alone?
Apparently, my wife ditched me
6 months ago.
Ditched?
I believe that's the term.
Where are you going?
The countryside.
A bed and breakfast.
Don't you like the coast?
- Yes, but...
- But?
I can't afford it.
You're in 1st class.
It's my only luxury.
What about you?
It's not my only luxury.
I meant are you on holiday, too?
No. Just for the weekend.
Alone?
I got ditched this morning,
before catching the train.
Ditched?
I believe that's the term.
I find that hard to believe.
May I borrow it?
Ticket, please
How do you do
I feel I've seen you somewhere before.
I'd remember.
Tickets, please.
- You're not in your seat?
- Guess not.
Sir, Madam
Thank you
Excuse me,
may I ask you a question?
Make it snappy.
Why did you sit in that seat?
Because you're exactly my type of man.
- He didn't show up.
- I know.
The train station was packed.
Remember the couple he employed?
We found them dead
in their new apartment.
The whole family.
Each with a bullet to the head.
We're not the only ones after him.
Remind me his name?
Perez. He's a good recruit.
Tell him to dress properly.
You know what I am
I don't speak English.
You know me!
I know you.
Anyway, better than
the commission members do.
We should talk
I told you I don't speak English.
Do you know him?
Ex-KGB. Officially,
he works for the Russian Ministry.
And unofficially?
The "White Collar Barons"
want Zimmer. They're afraid he'll talk.
Nassaev's got the job.
He's an excellent professional.
Want your sweater back?
Yes, please.
Thanks.
What are you doing this weekend?
- Welcome to the Carlton.
- I reserved under the name Manzoni.
Yes, indeed.
- Are you alone?
- No, my husband's with me.
Your suite is ready.
Do you get the Herald Tribune?
Or course. With breakfast?
Please.
Hello, sir.
After you.
The sitting room.
Please follow me.
The bedroom.
The closet.
The bathroom.
A library with a view of the ocean.
And last but not least, the terrace.
If you need anything, please dial 9.
Enjoy your stay.
Thank you.
Like it?
I'd have been bored on my own.
I didn't ask for an extra bed.
There's a sofa, but if you want...
The sofa's perfect.
Can you get it?
It must be the luggage.
Can you swim?
Looking for someone?
I was looking at the view.
What kind of work do you do?
Translator.
- What do you translate?
- A bit of everything:
Catalogues, contracts, manuals.
And you?
Do you mind?
Miss your B & B?
No.
I'm afraid I'll get hooked.
On what?
Luxury.
That's always a problem.
Judging from your swimsuit,
you've a way to go.
Can I ask you a question?
Again?
Why do you wear a man's watch?
It's yours.
No, I couldn't.
- Why, is it too heavy?
- It's too nice.
It suits you.
Just enjoying it.
Good night.
Evening, sir.
All's quiet.
Are they back?
At 1: 17 am.
The transcript.
Sorry.
Alert me if they go out.
- Sorry, sir.
- What is it?
I think your wife ordered it for you.
My wife.
I'll get a clean one.
Don't bother. Thanks.
As you wish.
Enjoy your breakfast.
Thanks.
Be back in an hour. Chiara
Reception, hold the line, please.
Hello? Hello?
What are you doing here?
They told me to wait.
What happened to you?
Someone tried to kill me.
Is this your statement?
I think so.
- Fransois Taillandier?
- That's me.
Your colleagues think I'm a nutcase.
Maybe they just wanted your watch.
Can I call my friend at the hotel?
Which hotel?
Hello. May I speak to...
Chiara.
- Chiara?
- Chiara Manzoni.
Chiara Manzoni, please.
Okay.
That's fine.
Thank you.
She paid an hour ago.
She left the hotel.
Have you known her long?
Yesterday morning.
I'll be back.
Why did your wife leave?
Guess she didn't like who I was.
Who were you?
That guy over there...
I think I saw him in the train.
So?
Maybe he's following us.
I think you're right.
Think so?
You should be a crime writer.
Why not.
The story begins with
a guy who just turns 38.
He decides to take a holiday.
Alone. For a few days.
Just to think things over.
He takes the train to Nice.
And in the train...
A woman sits opposite him.
What sort of woman?
She's a...
She's a fabulous creature.
The kind you read about in books.
What happens?
I think he'll fall in love.
What about her?
Does she fall in love, too?
No. A woman like her
can't fall for a guy like him.
That's not a happy story.
It's only the beginning.
Maybe there'll be a happy ending.
This is all I could find.
Thanks.
Did you see a doctor?
Excuse me.
Did you see a doctor?
You think I'm nuts?
You're bleeding.
We'll look inside your head.
Don't move.
I'm afraid the room's occupied.
I only want a quick look.
- Did I give you my card?
- Yes.
Hello
Sorry to bother you...
It's ok, come on in
Really sorry
Just one minute
Is everything ok?
Is everything well in our hotel?
In vacation?
Business
You can still relax
even it's for business
The anti-missile defense
system is very widespread...
The plane sends out decoys,
like fireworks.
The enemy missiles change target
and explode elsewhere.
There also exists flying decoys...
Yes?
This is Lieutenant Driss.
I have good news.
You do?
I checked the hotel.
Someone did shoot at you.
That's good news?
You're not crazy.
Any bad news?
Not at the moment.
Too bad.
What are you going to do?
Put on a bandage...
I cut myself on a can opener.
I nearly got killed.
True.
Listen. Tonight you're safe.
I'm not safe.
You have my card.
Any problem, just call me.
I'm staying in.
Good night.
Good night.
Shit.
Watch out
Excuse me.
Going down?
Yes.
They're gorgeous.
I'm a florist.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
I think this is your floor.
Bye.
Did you miss me?
A little, yeah.
You'll say I'm paranoid,
but someone wants me dead.
I know.
You know?
How?
Because I kissed you.
We look that similar?
Your body-type.
Is that all?
Nobody can recognize him.
Except you.
Nobody.
That was your rendez-vous
at the station.
- He's not involved.
- Okay.
Since you want to play the hero.
- We won't make it.
- Yes, we will.
We won't.
We made it.
Why are you smiling?
I'm happy to see you.
Now what?
Wait here.
Don't know where the light is.
What now?
A chair attacked me.
I don't regret it.
What?
Kissing you.
You've paid dearly for it.
Maybe I've some credit coming.
Found the light!
You'll be safe here.
It's well-stocked.
I should go to the police.
Why?
They protect people like me.
Like in the hospital?
Don't go out for a few days.
It'll all work out.
Things will work out.
When can I see you?
You don't get it?
I didn't sit opposite you by chance.
You're the same age
and physique as Anthony.
I was being followed.
I knew exactly what was going
to happen. I trapped you.
I don't believe you.
What did you think?
That I fell in love on the train.
Look at you!
I thought I was your type.
You're not entirely wrong.
Chiara!
Chiara!
Why did you do it?
Because I love him.
- Is he worth it?
- What?
All you're risking for him.
You haven't told me everything.
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir.
- A long expresso.
- Fine.
- Hello.
- Yes, sir?
Is Miss Chiara Manzoni in her room?
Yes she is. You are?
Police Officer Found Dead at Home
Hello
Water, please
Is this seat free?
Did I scare you?
Anthony's not here?
Will he be coming?
Is that him?
Tea with milk, please.
Sure
An expresso, with some water.
No problem
You'll have to pay.
I haven't a cent on me.
There was everything in the hideout...
Is that the term? A hideout?
Everything except money.
Are you okay about paying?
In any case... Congratulations.
Good taste, nice suit.
You'll get yourself killed.
Too bad.
What do you want?
People are looking.
Play the game. Kiss me.
I couldn't sleep last night.
I thought...
What a shit that guy is!
What a bad idea?
Sacrificing someone at random.
Some poor innocent guy!
Don't you think he's a shit?
If a guy loves you,
he should risk his life for you.
I'm risking my life by being here,
just to see you!
- He doesn't deserve you.
- You don't get it.
Your ticket please, sir.
My wife has the money.
Your wife?
Please get off the bus, sir.
Follow that bus!
My wife's on it. We just had a fight.
You're a real pain in the ass.
Nice suit.
It's on loan.
It fits perfectly.
Unfortunately.
So much for the introductions.
What's behind that?
You read too many detective stories.
I've already heard that.
I'm pleased to meet you.
I think you'll be disappointed.
You think so?
- I'm not Anthony Zimmer.
- I know.
Since when?
Since always.
Can I show you something?
Look closely.
That's you.
Bravo.
But look closer.
She has changed.
- Have you seen the paper?
- I've seen it.
Setting up a rendez-vous
in that house is a sign.
He'll be there.
He's suspicious.
Maybe he knows the score.
- He'll be there.
- Why?
You're his weakness.
What'll you do with Taillandier?
- Should've stayed in the hospital.
- To get killed.
You're unusually sentimental.
Do you fall in love
with all the men you betray?
I've never betrayed you.
What'll you do with Taillandier?
I'll take him.
To keep an eye on him.
Maybe I'll find out
what you see in him.
You all read the same paper.
An excellent paper.
It's got something
none of the others have.
It's sold worldwide.
That's why its classifieds
are so remarkable.
These days, no one
communicates by classifieds.
Except Anthony Zimmer.
The bastard's brilliant.
And perhaps too well informed.
Maybe Chiara warned him at the station.
Not a chance.
She has no feelings.
Except once,
when she saved you at the hospital.
What does she see in you?
Are you jealous?
Equipment in place?
Affirmative, division.
Unit, affirmative.
It's a camera problem.
Nothing I can do.
Here she comes.
Unit 1 to command post:
There's movement.
They saw someone.
What do we do?
We wait.
Anthony?
How are you?
Fine, thank you
If you don't mind
we are going to wait with you.
There are 4 of them.
5 with Nassaev.
What do we do?
We do what they do.
We wait for Zimmer.
I can't believe,
your lover could have forgotten your rendezvous
Perhaps he's somewhere around here
Looking at us.
Maybe he's here somewhere,
observing us.
What do you think?
What do you think?
Permission to intervene?
Sir!
We wait.
What do you think?
Sir.
Sir!
He'll show himself eventually.
Permission to intervene?
Negative.
Be patient
Do you know what?
If he cares about you, he should come right now
In five minutes it will be too late
He'd better come
or it'll be too late.
Five more minutes
or it'll be too late.
Where's Taillandier?
Good news, he loves you
He is not Anthony Zimmer
Nothing personally, Mr. Zimmer
Just business
Akerman! Akerman!
Tea with milk?
They forgot the milk.
He stood you up again.
Good thing you're here.
I chose well on the train.
Did you want to see him again?
Yes.
I wanted to arrest him.
I wonder where he's hiding.
I'm here.
I'm here.
Sorry,
Akerman wants you.
Coming.
Tell him I'll be there in 2 minutes.
You've got 2 minutes to escape.
With you.
Never.
Then I'm staying.
One minute left.
How's our hero?
We found it in the entrance.
Placed there in full view.
Is this the notebook?
That we've wanted for months.
Yes, this is it.
He's leaving us his money.
That's not like him.
No, that's not like him.
He won't let you go.
I didn't get your name.
You are...
Fransois Taillandier.
Talandier?
That's Taillandier.
T.A.I.L.L.A.N.D.I.E.R.
Thanks.
We're not going to find him now.
We got rid of Nassaev for him, too.
He won big.
Yes,
very big.
Is this seat free?
Be my guest.
