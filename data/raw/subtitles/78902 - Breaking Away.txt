You really
make that up?
Are you really
going to shave your legs?
Certo.  All
the Italians do it.
Some country. The women
don't shave theirs.
Eh, huh?
Stop!
It was somewhere right along here
that I lost all interest in life.
Aha! It was
right here.
This is where I saw
Dolores Reineke...
and fat Marvin!
Why, Dolores?
Why?
They're
married now.
See what I
saved you from?
If I hadn't told you, you never
would have followed them out here.
You made me lose
all interest in life,
and I'm grateful.
My brother said he saw
you and Nancy, Moocher.
When?
Uh... last Friday.
Well, it wasn't me.
I'm not seeing
her anymore.
I kind of
miss school.
This will be
the first time
no one will ask us
to write a theme
- About how we spent our summer.
- Yeah.
When you're 16,
they call it sweet 16.
At 18, you can drink,
vote, and see dirty movies.
What the hell do you get to do
when you're 19?
You leave home.
My dad said
Jesus never went further
than 50 miles from his home.
Look what
happened to him.
Whoo!
Hey, man,
this feels great!
Ahh!
Come on in!
Hey, come on in,
Dave.
I read where
this Italian coach said
it's no good to swim
right after a race.

He was as normal
as pumpkin pie,
and now look at him.
His poor parents.
It's that cologne
he wears.
It's called...
Neapolitan
Sunset.
Yeah? Well, the flies
seem to like it.
There.
This is it?
Well, you know what
the doctor said.
At your age...
What the hell
do you mean "at my age"?
Damn see-through coffee.
He says you have
a bad heart.
That's got nothing
to do with my age.
Our son's
ruining my health, Evelyn.
What's he going to do?
He wanted a year off,
so I give him a year.
It hasn't
been a year yet.
But, Evelyn, look what's happened
to him. He's turned into an "Ity."
"Ciao, Papa. Ciao, mama.
'Arrivederci. '"
That's "Ity" talk.
I used to think
it was funny at first.
Not funny anymore.
He was very sickly
until he started riding
around on that bike.
Well, now his body's fine,
but his mind is going.
He used to be
a smart kid.
I thought he'd
go to college.
You didn't want him to.
Why should he?
I never went.
At 19, I worked
in the quarry ten hours a day.
Most of the quarries
have closed.
Let him find
another job.
Jobs are not
that easy to find.
Let him look at least.
Let him come home
tired from looking.
He's never tired.
He's never
miserable.
He's young.
When I was young,
I was tired and miserable.
I had
my own place at 17.
He says Italian families
stay together.
Evelyn,
we are not Italian.
I know, I know.
It's just that I come
from a big family myself,
and it was
kind of nice.
He thinks we should
have another child.
What?
Buon giorno,
Papa.
I'm not Papa!
I'm your damn father!
Buon giorno,
Mama.
She's your damn mother.
Did you win again?
The victory,
she was easy,
but the promoter
tells me
that the Italians
will be here soon.
I will race
with the best... Italianos.
Like nightingales
they sing.
Like eagles
they fly.
Speaking of flies,
you brought some in.
Fly in Italian
is mosca.
In English
it's "pest."
Speaking of pests...
Isn't this
a lovely trophy?
Oh, yeah.
So what?
I lived 50 years,
I never got a trophy.
You never
got a trophy?
Nope, never got one.
I give you this,
numero uno,
King Papa.
Don't do that.
I have to take
a shower.

Nancy!
I was just
on my way to work.
Come on in.
You know what?
No. What?
I'm leaving home,
that's what.
Where are you going?
About
five blocks south.
Oh.
I found this nice
little place to rent.
It's so cute
I could scream.
My folks said I could have
some of their furniture.
All right!
Maybe you could
give me a hand... moving.
Oh, sure.
If I'm not too busy,
you know?
How's the job?
You know what?
Frank said if I keep up
the good work,
in time, I'll become
head cashier.
That's great.
Well,
I should go now.
Nancy.
Uh...
I think
I'll walk you to work.
I'm going out
that way anyways.
It gets 30 miles
to the gallon.
Of course, the mileage
you get may vary.
It's a beaut, right?
Right.
Boy, you sure know how
to pick 'em.
Frankly, this is
the best car on the lot.
Quality product.
Buon giorno,
Papa!
Come sta?
Friend of yours?
Aren't you glad
we got fired from the A & P?
I mean, right now,
we'd be working.
We didn't
get fired, Mike.
You got fired.
We quit.
All for one
and one for all.
You know, there
ain't many places
that will hire
all four of us.
- You know what I'd like to be?
- Smart.
A cartoon
of some kind.
Wouldn't that
be great?
You know,
when they get hit on the head
with a frying pan
and their head looks like
the frying pan
with the handle
and everything?
Then they
go booooing!
Their head comes
back to normal.
Wouldn't that
be great?
How did you get to be
so stupid, Cyril?
I don't know.
Guess I have a dumb heredity.
What's your
excuse, Michael?
You hear from
your folks, Mooch?
Yeah, my dad called.
There's a lot
more jobs in Chicago.
He hasn't gotten
anything yet, though.
Wanted to know
if the house was sold.
He could use the money
something fierce.
You can come live with me
when it's sold.
In Italy, everybody
lives together.
Since you won
that Italian bike, man,
you've been
acting weird.
You're really getting
to think you're Italian.
I wouldn't mind thinking
I was somebody myself.
I think the door's stuck
on that icebox.
I can't see him!
Oh, yoo-hoo!
It's got
no back on it.
What the hell
are they doing here?
I've never seen anybody
dive off from up there.
Hey, you bastards!
Who's that?
Hey, cutters!
They got indoor
and outdoor pools on campus,
and they got
to come here.
It's my
goddamn quarry.
This hole,
this quarry hole
is mine!
Hey, screw you, Cyril.
Come on, let's
get out of here.
If they
can come here,
then we'll go
to their campus.
Going to college
must do something
to girls' tits, I swear.
Just look at 'em.
Hi there!
What's your major?
Sure look like
they've got it made.
That's because
they're rich.
Italians are poor,
but they're happy.
Yeah, maybe
in Italy.
Whoa! Whoo!
Hey, good one.
Go!
All right! Here.
I wonder what it's like
to kiss a coed.
[Tires Screech]
Ha ha ha ha ha!
[Student]
Come on!
Hey, that bastard's
giving us the finger.
Hey, we're on
their turf, Mike.
Come on!
Dumb-ass
cutters!
Goddamn bastard-lickin'
retards!
Number 1, move!
Hut! 18! Hut!
[Whistle Blows]
I thought I was a great
quarterback in high school.
Still think so, too.
Can't even bring myself
to light a cigarette
because I keep thinking
I got to stay in shape.
Know what really gets me?
I got to live in
this stinking town,
and I got to read
in the newspapers
about some hotshot kid,
new star
of the college team.
Every year it's going
to be a new one...
and every year, it's
never going to be me.
I'm just going
to be Mike.
20-year-old Mike.
30-year-old Mike.
Old mean old man Mike.
These college kids will
never get old or out of shape
'cause new ones
come along every year.
They're going
to keep calling us cutters.
To them, it's just
a dirty word.
To me, it's just
something else
I never got
a chance to be.

What are we

I don't know, dear.
We could strangle him
while he's asleep.
That's not funny,
Evelyn.
Talk to him.
I'm afraid to talk to him.
I'm afraid to look at him.
I'm afraid his eyes

Don't go, Mooch.
They only let you out
on weekends and holidays.
See you later, Cyril.
Hey, don't forget

Hey.

You're a little late,

They ain't
too smart.

that Dave never...
What is this?
It's, um...
sauteed zucchini.
It's "Ity" food.
I don't want
no "Ity" food.
It's not.
I got it at the A & P.
It's like, uh... squash.
I know "Ity" food
when I hear it.
It's all them
"ini" foods...
Zucchini and linguini
and fettuccine.
I want some
American food, damn it!
I want

So why did you
give it up?
Oh, I don't know.
Ah...
I was sure I was going
to get that scholarship.
My dad, of course,
was sure that I wouldn't.
When I didn't, he was
really understanding, you know?
He loves
to be understanding when I fail.
"That's O.K., Cyril.
I understand."
He even bought me
that guitar
'cause he was sure
I'd never learn to play it.
I'm supposed to take
this college entrance exam.
You're going
to college?
Hell, no!
I just want to see
if I can pass.
Huh.
Maybe I'll take it, too,
and flunk it.

Hey, now, look at this.
That's the place

Most of you will only spend
four years here,
but to a lot of us,
Bloomington is our home.
I don't like how you've
been behaving in my home.
If you feel compelled to compete

you will do it in
a different arena.
We're expanding this year's
Little 500 bicycle race
to include
a team from the town.
But they're not
good enough.
I don't want to be
in the Little 500.
Oh, Christ.
I thought you'd jump
at the chance.
I don't want to be seen
with all those college kids.
That's the point!
Don't you want to beat
those shitheads
in front
of everybody?
Doesn't it take four
to have a team?
Well, we got four...
I mean, don't we?
We all enter,
Dave rides the whole thing,
and we win!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
Uh...
Iook, Mike.
I'm going to be working
that day, O.K.?
Working?
Yeah, I'm getting a job.
By yourself?
Yeah!
I need the money.
Thanks, Dave.
That's really great.

I'm really sick

Oh, shit!
You're just afraid

I'm just tired
of it, Evelyn.
I'm tired
of worrying about him.
Who'd ever hire
a guy like that?
He's going to
wind up a bum...
An Italian bum.
Well, you could use
some help.
What if you
gave him a job?
I don't want him
selling used cars.
Why not?
It's good enough
for you.
Who says
it's good enough for me?
You do.
Damn right
it's good enough for me,
but I don't need
any help.
He'd ruin me
if I hired him,
a weirdo kid
like that.
[Whistling]
Hey! No whistling!
You're supposed
to be a shag boy, so shag.
If I wanted whistling,
I'd get a bird.
How are you feeling?
Tired, Papa.
Exhausted?
Yeah.
Get used to it.
It's going to be more of the same.
Let's go home.
I have to train.
The Italian race
is next week.
[Horn Honks]
Pop, can I have
this Saturday off?
Hell, no.
Just this once, Papa.
The Italians
are coming Saturday.
I don't care
if the Second Coming's coming.
But I waited
so long.
No!
N-o-double-O. No!
Uh-oh.
You stay out of this.
Don't come in here
with that. It's sold.
You said there was
a 90-day guarantee.
Guarantee?
What guarantee?
You gave me
your word.
Have you got it
on paper?
There was no paper,
but you gave me your word.
Word? I don't remember
hearing any word.
Get this car off my lot!
We have to take it back.
Who are you?
We're poor,
but we're honest.
All I want
is a refund.
Refund?
Refund?
Are you crazy?
Refund?
Refund?
Refund?
Refund?
Easy. Easy.
Easy, Ray.
Refund?
Refund.
Refund?
I've ruined everything.
He needed a rest anyway,
and now he's getting it.
I'm not going
to the race.
I should be here
when Papa wakes up.
Um...
did I ever
show you this?
It's a passport.
It's quite cheap,
you know.
A real bargain.
I carry this with me
all the time.
Someday, there'll be
a new girl at the A & P,
and when I
cash a check,
she'll ask
for identification,
and I'll take out
my passport,
and I'll say,
" Here!"
Oh, Mama.
So you see,
I think
you really should go.
I think
you should come home...
singing...
with a trophy.
I think you should do
all those things while you can.
I'll win this one
for you, Mama.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to today's
Cinzano 100-mile road race.
Here they come
to the starting line...
Team Cinzano,
ladies and gentlemen!
Timers,
if you are ready,
we'll stand by
for the start
of the Cinzano 100.
Riders, ready!
Timers, ready!
The Cinzano 100 is underway,
ladies and gentlemen.
The riders are starting off
on a 100-mile journey.
Come on!
Hey!
Hey!
Buon giorno!
Come'sta?
Oggi e molto umido,
non e vero?
Niento vero.
Grazie! Grazie!
Grazie!
Che tempo
fara piovera!
Filare!
Bravo! Bravo!
I feel like one
of those dwarfs,
like, when they think
that Snow White's dead.
Well, I guess you're
a cutter again, huh?
Just like the rest of us?
I guess so.
Hey, cheer up, Dave.
You still got the 500.
Thanks a lot.
No, I don't feel lucky
to be alive.
I feel lucky
I'm not dead.
There's a difference.
Oh! What
happened to you?
Oh, it's nothing, Ma.
How do you feel, Dad?
" Dad"?
I'll tell you how
I'm feeling, son.
I had nightmares
all night
that every customer
I ever had
came in to ask
for a refund.
You were there
handing out checks.
"One for you,
one for you..."
I'm sorry I gave him
back his money.
I really am.
Everybody cheats.
I just didn't know.
Well, now you know.
Where's your trophy?
Daddy!
What's the matter?
What are you
crying for?
It's not like you
lost your wallet.
I didn't want you
to be this miserable.
A little bit's
all I asked for.
Come on now.
Talk to him, Evelyn.
What are you doing?
Hi, Kathy.
What did you do
to yourself?
Oh, I liked you
better before.
What happened
to your cornocello?
Now you look like
everybody else.
I am everybody else.
I mean...
Listen, Kathy...
Catherina!
I feel terrible.
You sound funny.
Che cosa, Enrico?
Tell me.
Look...
Kathy, I...
My name is
Dave Stohler.
I made all
that other stuff up.
I was born in Bloomington.
I went to
Bloomington high.
I was treasurer
of the Latin Club...
Stop kidding
around.
I'm not
kidding around!
See...
I'm what you
call a cutter.
Oh, and Napoli?
And the
big family?
Well, it was
a good act.
You...
You certainly
fooled me.
You know
what you are?
I got a clue.
I'll tell you
what you are.
Oh, God!
You...
Dave.
Yes, Dad?
I cut the stone
for this building.
You did?
Yeah. I was one
fine stonecutter.
Mike's dad,
Moocher's, Cyril's...
all of us.
Well, Cyril's dad...
never mind.
Thing of it was,
I loved it.
I was young
and slim and strong.
I was damn
proud of my work.
And the buildings
went up.
When they were finished,
the damnedest thing happened.
It was like...
the buildings
was too good for us.
Nobody told us that.
Just...
Just felt uncomfortable,
that's all.
Even now, I...
I'd like to be able
to stroll through the campus
and look
at the limestone,
but I just feel
out of place.
You guys still go swimming
in the quarries?
Sure.
All you got to show
for my 20 years of work
is the holes
we left behind.
I don't mind.
I do.
Cyril's dad says he took
that college exam.
We both took it.
How did
both of us do?
Well,
I don't know.
One of us
did O.K.
But neither...
of us...
Hell, I...
don't want to go
to college, Dad!
To hell with them!
I'm proud
of being a cutter.
You're not a cutter.
I'm a cutter.
What,
are you afraid?
Yeah.
A little bit.
And then there's
the rest of the guys.
Well, you
took the exam.
Did all right,
didn't you?
Yes.
Well, that's...
That's good.
Well, your mom...
Your mom will be
expecting us home.
Come on.
I'm supposed to
ride this thing?
Well, that's
the official issue.
You can't add or
change anything.
Well, it's a
piece of junk!
Hey, it's got a lot
of personality to it.
It doesn't look
that bad to me.
That's 'cause
you don't have to ride it.
You don't have to ride.
We're not going to beg you.
We'll plead,
but never beg.
The hell with it!
Get off, Cyril.
At least
we got invited.
I'll just
take it back.
You seem
relieved, Mike.
Don't you think
we can win anymore?
Why not?
Maybe those guys
are better than us.
That's the first
time you ever said that!
That's the first time
I ever felt that.
All right.
Hello.
What are you
doing here?
I'm leaving soon.
Where are you going?
I got a job
in Chicago.
Moocher's dad got
a job in Chicago.
He's, uh...
I'm going to Italy
after all with my parents.
Great, Kath.
I wish you
a nice trip.
You, too.
I'm not going
anywhere.
I don't know
about that.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
If you eat so much,
how come you're small?
Oh, it's my
metabolism.
I eat three
times a day.
My metabolism
eats five times a day.
Well, I go back
to work tomorrow.
You won't
watch us race?
He thought he might
bring you bad luck.
Well, I just have
work to do, that's all.
Besides, there might be
another metabolism to feed here.
We might be
a father?
No, I might be a father.
Your mom might be a mother.
You might be a brother.
That way, I keep it
all in the family.
I didn't think
people your age...
The next word
may be your last.
You must
be very happy.
Do I have
any choice?
You were going
to give a pep talk.
They don't need pep.
I need pep.
Go on,
give it to them.
Uh, we thought...
As long as
you're out there,
you might as well
tell them who you are.
Right.

Gentlemen,
thank you very much.
I want to point out three flags
you'll have to obey.
First, the green flag
means the race is on.
The green flag means
you are racing.
The yellow flag means
there's been an accident
or someone has a problem
that will slow down the track.
Please follow
your leader.
The third flag is
the checkered flag.
This needs
no explanation.
This is a 200-lap,
50-mile bicycle race.
It will consist of 33
4-man teams.
For the first year,
an out-of-town team has
been invited to participate.
I'm sure they'll give
their best effort.
The Cutters,
ladies and gentlemen.
Any team members may exchange
to another team member
whenever they feel exhausted
or in need of help.
Gentlemen...
mount your
Roadmaster bicycle.

They're on
the starting line.
They're coming down!
The green flag is up!
The Little 500
is underway!
And here they come,
rounding the corner
for the completion of
the first of 200 laps today.
So after 25 laps,
two of the perennial
favorites
are up front...
The Sigma Tau Omega team
and the Acacia team.
I should point out
what a remarkable job
the Cutter team is doing.
They started in
34th position
and are moving up
through the field.
Oh...
The Acacia team just signaled
for an exchange.
The single rider is
accelerating away,
getting a lead
so the receiver
will not be behind
when the pack comes by.
Beautiful exchange!
The other team is exchanging
right behind them.
Sigma Tau Omega team.
Another team is moving in
on the outside.
It's team 34,
the Cutter team.
He is fighting hard
to take the lead.
He has taken the lead!
Team 34 has succeeded
in taking the lead
from the last position.
What an incredible effort
by the leader of this race.
Come on!
You got him!
The Delta Chis
and the Acacia team.
The rider for
the Cutters team...
Dave Stohler...
That's my boy!
is pulling
ahead even further...
Pulling ahead!
It's incredible
what he's...
Come on, Dave!
He's turning in
some terrific
lap times here.
I don't happen to have
a stopwatch, but...
He won't last.
It's utterly amazing.
After 25 miles...
that's 100 laps, folks...
the rider for the Cutters
is still out front.
He has yet to
come in for an exchange.
We're
number one!
Someone's down.
There's an accident.
I can't see who.
Just a second.
It's Dave Stohler
from the Cutter team.
He had a 3/4-lap lead.
I can't see
if he's hurt.
He's getting back
on the bike,
but he's obviously
in agony.
Come on, Dave!
No way.
He wants off, man.
That's the signal.
He's coming in.
Here you go.
I don't want
to race.
Get on the bike!
It's ours now.
It's our race.
We got it.
Get going!
No one is going.
The other riders
are holding the bike.
Get out there,
Mike!
Get on the bike!
The little
guy's riding!
- You O.K.?
- What's the matter?
What
happened?
As a result of that
terrible exchange,
the Cutter team has
dropped from the lead.
The Sigma Tau Omega team
has regained the lead.
The Cutter team has fallen
into second position.
Another team has passed
the Cutter team.
The Cutters
are in third place
and seem to be
losing ground.
Well, Ev, he tried.
Even the announcer
said he tried.
It's all over.
Help!
Nice try, kid.
The lead team has just
completed 170 laps.
There are 30 laps
remaining.
Sigma Tau Omega
looks unbeatable.
Many things can happen,
as we've already seen.
Things can change
like the wind.
Stay on
this side.
Bring it in!
Go, you Cutter, go!
The Cutters now have
a new man on the bike.
He's doing a good job.
He has moved the Cutters
into fourth position.
He might make a serious
challenge for third position.
We'll wait to see
if this happens.
We're not
doing too bad.
This once again points out
the fact that this
is a team effort.
One man may fall back,
another may be exceptional...
We showed them.
Showed them what?
Come on, Mike!
Bring it in!
Come on!
Stohler is on the bike,
his teammates are taping
his feet to the pedals.
This means he won't be able
to exchange riders.
He must ride
15 laps by himself.
Pick it up!
Pick it up!
Pick it up!
He's back in
the race!
He has dropped from fourth
into sixth position.
There are only
15 laps remaining.
Go, son!
Go, damn you!
Stay behind him
till the third turn.
The Cutters,
team number 34,
now in second place.
They have completed
198 laps.
198 laps!
Still leading, Sigma Tau Omega,
team number 1.
And here comes your leader
through turn number four.
Coming down
to take the white flag!
One lap to go!
It's a duel between
Sigma Tau Omega and Cutters,
teams number 1 and 34,
as they battle out
through the last lap.
Teams number 1 and 34
battling neck-and-neck
as they come down
the short stretch.
Half a lap to go.
They're going into
turn number three.
Number 1,
still leading.
34 coming up very close
on the inside!
They're going
for the checkered flag!
And 34 wins!
And 34 wins!
And now, this is what
you have been waiting for.
The winning team,
from Bloomington,
Indiana,
the winner of
the Little 500...
The Cutters!
Bye.
Pardon.
Do you know where
is the Office of the Purser?
You must mean
the Bursar's Office.
Uh...
oui,  Bursar.
I was thinking
of taking French,
but it's
my first year.
Have you seen
Le Tour de France?
No.
No? Mon dieu!
The French riders,
they're the best!
Hiya, big shot!
