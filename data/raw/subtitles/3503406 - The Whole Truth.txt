Did you ever wrote his name on the passenger list?
Objection your honor.
Women who are on the passenger list?
What is the relation ?
Honourable, ...
Do you have strong evidence on this issue, Mr. Ramsey.
Do you have any evidence or not in this court?
No, Your Honor.
You fishing ...
If I allow will be ...
Now go back to your place.
Invite you in answering that question.
That would violate the law.
Announce the passenger's name on the passenger list, so now ...
Of course I will not do.
There are no more questions.
You pick up Mr. Lassiter and her son at Lake Front Airport.
It is true. Lake Front.
The next day at 7 am ...
You drove Mr. Lassiter and his son again ...
It is true. Directly to the airport.
Is there anything unusual.
No. None at all.
When he returned two days later ...
In the afternoon when the murder took place ...
You also drove him home.
Correct.
Did you notice there is not as usual.
No ... no matter what's up.
Is there something or someone that is not as usual.
Nobody.
thanks.
There are no further questions, Your Honor.
Do you ever pick up women ...
From where Mr. Lassiter ...
- Objection, Your Honor ... - ... heading to the airport.
Ignore.
Sit down Mr. Ramsey ...
Excuse me a moment ...
This was the case if you lose.
It's the best I can do, until you talk to me.
Boone ruined everything,
I do not want to associate this case makes Boone looks nasty.
I have a picture of Loretta knew and did not care as long as it helps my case.
- Mr. Ramsey .. I Janelle Bailey. - You're too late.
No, .. I was late. I ...
Just read rule number 3.
Get you a witness, yes, I know.
Janelle Bradley ... Ini Jack Leblanc.
Just so you know she's a girl Walter Bradley.
I asked him as my representative, but he was not present.
Janelle is recommended.
His father was also notorious late.
But never too late in the trial,
- You're kidding concerns of American women. - Do you ask.
I sat in the back all the time,
It is the selection of the jury,
I know .. I'm sorry. I was trying to call.
At the trial, I never answer the phone when the trial took place,
Good.
I still have two blacks, two single mothers.
- And the white children. - Damn.
- There is no guarantee, I'll call you this afternoon. - Go ahead.
You want to work or not?
Ramsey.
Five minutes.
OK.
Jury consultant LeGrand.
Yes, it is a challenge, involving jury number three.
That speed money ..
Nothing can be done, in addition to worrying about people stealing from him.
He thought like that.
Sentenced to death, is quite terrible.
So he decided to bring her daughter.
Tell me who you are?
I graduated in 2007 Benfield.
In Colombia the legal field.
A training and then return to combat ...
Corporate crime although it is not my area of ​​expertise.
So I leave one year.
To do what?
Regroup.
Di Leroux?
Stepfather.
He uses Meth you?
Do not be shy.
It's been 18 months, taking anti-depressants.
You still wear?
Low doses.
Because once I introduce you in court.
You can not decide when in the middle of the road ...
SEMA.
I'll be there.
Your father told you experts detect lies.
Who lie this morning ...
In earlier trials mean ...
What they do not teach it in law school.
Yes, all of the witnesses lied.
About what?
Maintain employment.
Won the case.
Money, most people ignore morality.
To be like the girls and boys were good.
Sex make chaotic person, unless proven otherwise.
And ....
The main one to shy away from shame.
Do you think the person is afraid of prison and shot dead, ...
No.
That is the face of the law.
And this morning ...
Flight stewardess ...
Angela Morley ?
Day...
It seems surprised when you ask about the passenger name list.
Looking into his hands after he answered.
I think Lassiter brought her in flight.
And he does not want to lose his job because of this problem.
Next ...
Limo driver.
When he said drove straight to the airport.
So maybe they stopped to pick up women.
And I.
What lie?
You've a private plane.
And since you entered this room.
You never drink anti depression during life.
That does not count.
As you heard ...
My client will not talk to anyone.
Including me.
Which means that I have to defend him without knowing all the facts.
Which means just looking for facts in the file alone.
So ...
If your lie detector lights up, you tell me.
Other than that ...
Your window to the entrance.
I'm sure people at the table that your client is innocent.
That's the deal.
Honourable.
I want to introduce my associate Janelle Bradley at this conference.
It has to do with Walter Bradley?
Yes, Your Honor.
His daughter.
A good lawyer.
I got a phone call at 4:42 pm.
Domestic violence is the possibility of article 187.
And 187 it is ...?
Murder.
- And it was on the afternoon of 4 February. - Yes, Sir.
And you are responding to.
My car is nearby.
I do not know what I'm waiting for help or go alone, but ....
But I was told the situation was under control, so I went.
Please hurry, this is my husband ...
Who is he ?
Michael, our son ...
What do you do first?
I made sure the victim was killed.
He was already dead.
Hello ...
I called a lawyer, I'll go.
Should have been done long ago.
What Mike said?
- I should've done a long time ago. - Objection noble.
This is not consistent with ...
- Sworn statements from the officers themselves. - What he said has been clarified.
Steed officers, in the police report stated ..
Should have been done long ago.
I should not ....
Without pronoun, my client might mean, someone
This should have been done long ago.
Affect other people ...
Who do ...
Continue ....
So where ...
Wait a minute.
Yes, I'm sure he said ...
I ...
Should have been doing ...
Since a long time ago ...
Should have been done long ago.
How much time is needed from staff to get there?
Just how many minutes.
I've let the lawyer lord ....
Tuan Ramsey.
Yes, Sir. I've told him.
I want their children to stay away from the corpse.
Mike.
He must stay away.
Dear.
We must ...
Go to your room right now, so that the police can do their work, okay?
It ...
I want you both to remain near here.
Thanks.
There are no further questions your honor.
Tuan Ramsey.
You can go back.
- Let's stop until tomorrow at 9 am - You see Mike.
You see what if in open court.
I should have done a long time ago to the police.
Seriously ?
Unless you begin to tell me.
We're going to lose.
Everything stands.
Why did not he want to talk to you?
That's the problem. People refuse to talk.
Never said why.
Violence heads will take you in prison for life.
- Did he say anything to you? - Loretta Lassiter ... Janelle Bradley.
Hai ...
What was she talking to?
- Loretta - Wait. I was frightened.
- You can not let him in prison - Calm is only the first day.
He still children,
Newspapers make him become a monster.
I know .. I know it.
But also in there it sounds ...
Sure it sounds bad at first.
I want to see him, can I meet him?
Yes, you can go down and ask for permission.
A terrible position for him to be in there.
Yes, the maternal instinct is never easy.
Loretta fact if compared with the other.
He was quite calm.
Where's your car?
- Around the corner there. - They send you to see the lie.
254 rooms.
Marina hotels.
On our earth.
You do not have an office?
Ya.
People there expect me to answer the phone ...
Answering emails only God knows what else.
All we need is in room 254.
Witness statements, police reports, the coroner's report.
Are you going to come?
Everything is here.
I hope.
Tomorrow at 9, okay?
I doubt he will return once he knows what he faces.
But just sitting there ...
In addition to Mike ...
Will help look brave ...
The spoiled rich kid ...
Behave anti-socially, ...
Maybe it can make him talk.
The funny thing that I do in my murder trial is Boone.
It was a case of teenage mother hates her own baby
Put him in a trash bag, and dumped into the bay.
From the photos alone can sue him.
But Boone kept saying ...
If you can survive ...
Similarly to the jury.
He made me talk to him, put my hand on it.
Every day I tell her that she's beautiful, ...
Little things like that mean.
Please tell us how you know that the victim was dead.
He was my neighbor for 15 years.
Door neighbors house.
Ya.
Are you friends with her?
I like to Boone.
My wife said she was good at entertaining.
Our son Alexander classmate Mike.
Newmont.
So we were off the fence so that children can play together.
How do you describe the relationship between Boone and Mike?
Very close.
Loretta seems like a good woman.
Mike wants to be a lawyer.
Like his father. She's a lawyer?
Believe me, the jury will not like him.
Mike learned quickly.
He was very studious.
He's very, very clever.
When Mike was 12 years old, ...
She wanted to come to camp forensics.
I'm sorry what forensic camp?
It's like CSI.
You are taught how to solve the crime scene.
However, when she returned.
Something happens in our block.
Linger in someone poisoned cat neighbors.
Then Mike.
I do not know how?
But he knows who did it.
Ya.
There was a photo of him in the newspaper.
Their closeness ...
The bond between father and son.
What it continued until the death of the victim?
No.
No. Something happens, I do not know, maybe you know ...
Want to rebel, but ...
It happened just like that, uh ...
I think about 8 months before Boone was killed.
Well, I do not want to offend the liberal state here.
Or maybe ...
Listen I'm not stupid.
I would choose for my sake alone.
Of course.
Everyone should think about their own interests.
That's how democracies work.
- Is that true ? - Oh of course.
I mean.
Wow, .. I agree with you.
Of course. Agree with you.
You agree ?
Of course.
You say of course.
Did I say something that is not clear.
Come on dear ...
Honey, you are not drunk, is not it?
I'm drunk.
And tomorrow.
I would wake up with your head spin.
And you.
You stupid what a stupid ...
To be honest, ...
Nobody cares what you think.
What you just know now.
You must type in ...
He's like a poor woman, she can take care of himself.
- She's smart, she's got a degree, then ... - Stop.
Then you talk ...
Ya.
You try to stop him.
Ya. ..
Then what happens?
Come on ...
- Never mind - I do not do anything.
Come here.
No one is talking to Boone as such.
Nobody.
Well, I can not ...
I can not ...
Hear what Boone told him ...
But I can see ...
The effect on Mike.
Look at me.
After they finished speaking ...
Boone walked towards me.
There's something you want to say?
None of your business.
Do you know.
You look at me like that again.
I'll kick your ass.
There's nothing I will not try to do.
No dessert if they are hungry.
You can imagine. That was the end of ...
Our friendship.
I do not want Alex to get there, I do not want him associated.
With people who behave like that.
Thank you ....
There are no further questions, Your Honor.
Tuan Ramsey.
There was no question of me, Your Majesty.
You can download.
Start talking.
Then what defense we have?
You mean, we're screwed.
I do not know ...
Many have told me.
There is always a way for defense.
As a person you shoot first such killings.
Correct.
I will tell you quite brutal in there.
Not bad.
What do you mean ?
How much do you know about Muhammad Ali.
I know she did not go to law school.
More than that.
In 1974 he beat George Foreman.
7 years younger.
He KO all those who fought him.
Foreman's peak.
Round to round and he just hang in there.
Take a hit.
She looks could not fight back.
Nobody knows why ...
You mean he lost a knockout.
Ya.
And finally in round eight.
Foreman fatigue.
Tired of hitting him.
Already exhausted.
Suddenly Ali "alive" again.
In one round Foreman in kanvaskan as parents.
What do you mean ?
During this day, ....
We lose.
In situations like this, detective.
The family seems to be at odds.
Is it normal ...?
Already strained.
Sorry?
Anyone who is not a harmonious marriage is the prime suspect.
But you make a conclusion very quickly.
Ya.
When I first spoke with officers at the scene.
There were not as usual ...
He said that should have been done long ago.
- He tell me, what they are saying it. - ... What is normal.
And I saw the knife.
And there are fingerprinted.
And the size of the palm of his hand change your focus.
Ya.
But just to be safe we ​​take the child and his mother to the office for questioning.
- Where were you, when the incident? - And what about Mike?
You have to answer me.
He did not speak at all.
First of all I want to say.
And his mother?
His mother did not have to be conveyed.
In the vice chancellor ...
Thank you, detective. There are no more questions.
You're the detective who led the case, is it true?
Yes, Sir.
And you say from the beginning you do not pursue other suspects,
Aside from the defendant.
It is true.
Why is that ?
You want me to answer that question?
Ya.
Because ...
In the opinion of my professional.
It is already very clear.
The boy did.
There are no further questions, Your Honor.
Mike's fucking annoying.
I decided to let him think I've given up.
Let the evidence at the show.
In lay.
Hope the judges think everything is going very well ..
And begin not taken into account.
Without knowing what to do.
It's from the crime lab New Orleans, division evidence.
Yes, Sir.
Sir, what is the cause of death?
Stab knife.
In the middle of the chest.
Only one thrust.
Yes, Sir.
Makes losing a lot of blood.
Victims lose consciousness for a moment.
Killed immediately.
thanks.
So the victim no scratches whatsoever.
There was no sign of a struggle, no skin under her fingernails.
Which makes me believe he knew the person.
And he stabbed suddenly.
You were in the room when the murder took place.
No sir.
Is there a hair on the victim's shirt?
Of the defendant and his mother.
In addition, people who are in the place of the murder.
And throughout the house.
In the hallways, bathrooms, stairs ...
Your staff are also in place.
Ya.
And did not find any.
Nothing whatsoever.
Hair.
Droplets of blood.
None.
Look at this ...
Mom said she ...
He bath when the incident occurred, wash her hair.
But ...
They found it at the crime scene hair, and only one in showernya.
So mixed while she was washing her hair.
Scott ...
Details of this kind would confuse the lawyer.
Mmm .. hmmm.
There was no other evidence.
Sir, you told me that there was nothing, which may ...
Directly or indirectly ...
That leads to a suspect.
Aside from the defendant.
It is true.
This makes the case perfectly.
Do you doubt it?
No sir.
There are no more questions.
You can go back, sir Douchet.
You lived next door Lassiter?.
Yes, Sir.
Since age?
Two years.
And you make friends with Mike?
Usually, when we were children.
But family friends.
Ya.
Alexander.
Yes, Sir.
I think we were all friends.
The defendant Mike.
Your father testified ...
That she and her father, do crack.
Ya.
And you see it.
Yes, I see that.
Now tell us, what you see.
Honestly I'm a bit jealous ...
They seem close.
But that is changing.
It is true.
Why ?
I have something to ...
As the saying ...
But I can not say.
I have something with her mother.
Why do you think there was something about him?
Is it something he said?
Something he said?
No, he never said anything.
Ouch!
Ouch, ..
Ben, come on ... You hurt me.
Dear ...
And you are witnesses ...
What happened in the backyard of Mike with his father?
Ya.
Oh .. no, no.
I was not an eyewitness.
Dad said what happened in the backyard was a coincidence.
But after the change occurs in Mike.
No.
Previous.
At least six months later.
Mike said to me ...
With his father ...
While he does not fit.
A blind man could see he was something with Loretta.
I let him talk long enough, so that the judges missed the point.
Alexander ...
Did you ever see Boone unpleasant to his wife?
Umm ... yes.
Rude.
Ya.
The use of violence.
Here !!
No !
Here !!
- Here !! Damn! - No !
Maybe.
Not your family, you can not tell whether it is normal.
Did you ever see him behave ...
Brutal on him.
Let me listen ...
- Come on ... - Do Boone ...
Brutally ...
I do not know ...
OK.
You never saw it.
But is there anything in their relationship.
Their marriage ...
Make you uncomfortable.
He seems ...
He was so faded.
Day after day she was ....
Evil to him ...
It seems he does not want to live anymore.
There are no questions, Your Honor.
Loretta.
Calm down.
They'll call you tomorrow ...
Are you ready?
Naturally, I could not resist.
It can not be. Yes
I can be in prison ...
Because insulting the court. I can not help this time.
The wife does not have to testify against her husband,
But a mother will testify ... to his son.
As there is no attachment somehow, or at least what ...
Loretta.
It must be you live, ...
It's part of our strategy.
If they do not call you, ...
I'll call you, the better they are calling you ...
Stick to the strategy, yes ...
It is better you do not smoke.
I know, it makes me calm.
- Hei Mike.
- Hai.
How is he?
He's okay, I guess.
He wanted go to Reed, but Boone forced to Stanford.
But Boone force he entered Stanford as more prestigious.
I can not say anything, because I never lecture.
As ...
How about a drink here ....
Mike bright boy, he will be fine wherever he is.
Oh, ya.
I wish I knew how to help him.
I just read something ...
If there are people who say things you suspicious.
It's same.
With a wave of his brain reaction or something ...
It was exactly the same.
As devastated.
Sometimes my father hit me when he was drunk.
I am fine.
I hate myself, because it can not protect Mike.
I never once mentioned the word divorce in Boone.
He says he will kill me.
Oh, I'll find you.
My money you can count on.
Loretta.
You laugh, might assume this is just a joke.
This is not a joke.
OK.
Lie.
Leave aside the strangeness of Alex.
Why detective Graves ...
Not pursue other leads.
When collecting forensic evidence.
He gets recognition.
He thinks he does not need anymore.
Why are you silent?
Never embarrass the police ...
In front of the jury ...
Unless forced to do.
Other than that ...
We still tug.
I do not know, it was not in favor of this ..
Okay. I had two hours ...
Before I had to let Loretta to testify.
But first ...
I want to eat first.
What causes you to stay in Leroux?
Oh, that.
Embarrassing.
A man.
At the company ...
Fellow ...
Day ...
Married ...
Cheating.
Well. It was ...
Become an obsession.
Something like that.
Why ?
Are you stalking him?
Calling him.
Send SMS.
10 times a day or even more.
Follow him.
Parking in front of his house.
His wife ...
Get out and call the company.
They fire you.
Ya.
Leroux seemed the best option at the time.
So you crazy?
Past.
Well, I should go to prepare testimony.
Walter refused to tell me ...
The actual situation ...
Because he committed ...
Insists it voluntarily.
Actually nonsense.
He was a good father.
God help me ...
I'm ready ...
Please tell me what your name is to be noted.
Loretta Lassiter.
And you're married to the victim?
Ya.
And you are the mother of the accused?
Correct.
Please tell me when the murder of your husband that afternoon.
At that time ...
Afternoon as usual.
When it rains ....
Previous ...
Mike was training football ...
Or ...
So I guess ...
Then I sport ....
In our gym ...
From 3 pm to 4 hours.
What you are waiting for your husband home?
Ya.
But I do not know what time ...
He always sms when he landed, but ...
But I did not hear him come in, then I exercise.
And where are you when he comes home?
I am taking a bath.
And then ?
We ...
Speak a few words.
And then I continue shower.
A few words ...?
What the talk, Mrs. Lassiter.
I'd rather not say.
You're under oath, sir.
Mrs. Lassiter.
He said ...
Some ....
It was very rough and ....
And I better not say it.
It rude what your husband said, Mrs. Lassiter?
- Mrs. Lassiter. - No.
No...
He was my husband.
I'm sure you have some idea of ​​the testimony of Mr. Westin.
My husband became ...
Very cruel ...
You should arrest me.
For harassing the court, ...
I do not want to repeat what he had said.
Tuan Lebranc, aku setuju dengannya ...
Do you still want to continue?
We see the sequel, Your Honor.
All right, ma'am Lassiter.
After your husband say sarcastic things that you ...
Then what happens?
Like I said, I ...
I take a shower, and ...
And ...
When I came out.
Mike at the front door.
And ...
Is he dead?
She asked ...
Is father dead?
I checked and he was already dead.
And then Mike said ...
What Mike said, Mrs. Lassiter?
Please, madam ...
You must answer the question aloud.
He told me to do.
He said ....
As I do ...
As I do ...
Mrs Lessiter.
It is your husband's rude to tell you.
What often happens?
I'm sorry, what ...?
Is she verbally mistreating be repeated.
Yes, keep repeating.
And Mike often witnessed.
Honor who judged here?
Continue.
We all stayed in one roof.
I'm sure he heard ...
Very often ....
And if your husband's treatment of violence, including beating.
Is often just words?
Mean?
Is Mike just heard a harsh word that your husband say?
Or he also saw and heard ...
Your husband hit you.
Ya.
Any time.
Ya.
And when was the last time?
- By the time he died. - Sorry, Your Honor.
It's weird, I asked the witness what happened that day, and he will not tell.
This testimony clearly set and trained by him.
In fact, the witness said he confessed murderer of my client.
Do you want to cut this testimony host LeBlanc?
Okay, Mr. Ramsey even if there is violence.
Where's the proof, sir.
Police report, whatever it is, Your Honor.
I've marked for identification evidence NB ...
Photos ...
Luka ...
Mrs. Lassiter on February 5th.
In the authorities I provide copies.
And the prosecutor ...
- May I approach the witness? - Please.
Mrs. Lassiter ....
Do you recognize this document?
Ya.
You recognize that photo?
Ya.
Whether taken on the day after your husband's death.
Yes, right.
Is it true and accurate picture ...
Wounds that can attack your husband before he died.
Yes, right.
As a note.
Defenders ...
Provide evidence of A and B.
I accept the evidence.
Loretta will say anything so Mike can last.
But the idea must be kept on track
Make him say that proves Mike persecuted and defend it from there.
And he succeeded ...
Not in doubt again.
This photo ...
Why do you hide from me.
I saw the first time last night.
Keep straight.
What now ...?
I thought it would break.
What ?
Thanks.
Damn.
I will not put you in there.
Never testified before.
Unless you know what you have to say,
You know it.
This can not be happening.
Mr. Ramsey, you're not a lawyer again?
Give us a minute, okay ...
Mike ....
We have a chance to win.
Why are you back now?
Huh ...
It's really a disaster.
I do not know what would Mike say ...
There was no preparation, and he knows it.
Usually a client who refuses to speak to me because ....
No evaluation of the state of the psyche.
But Mike was not crazy.
He just does not believe in anyone ...
Including me.
This is not true, is not it?
You want to ask him?
But it was crazy.
You promised me.
I do not know, you think I'm lying to you?
If you do not let him testify, he would fire her.
Why did you interrupt ...
This is between me and attorney Mike ...
- Ramsey ... - Listen to me.
I could not resist him not to testify.
These constitutional rights.
You know it.
He knew it.
Okay?
When I defended in Bar n Brawl.
When a client is two men.
Was fighting and shooting people's heads.
I lose.
It's hard for the jury would understand.
Why is there a tendency to kill ...
Of each other ...
They always look two against one.
Tuan Ramsey.
You miss pembukaanmu statement at the beginning of this trial.
You get another chance right now.
Can speak, Your Majesty ...
Your Honor, my client insisted on testifying.
Because I did not know what he'll say.
So I have to put more pembukaanku statement.
I sympathize ...
Deputy.
Tuan Ramsey.
The question?
Please tell me your name's on the record.
Aku Michael Lassiter.
Michael ...
Is it true that you did not say anything since the death of your father.
Ya.
Why ?
I do not know.
You do not know why?
No.
My father taught me that I have the right not to talk.
Then why do you want to talk now?
To tell the truth ...
About who he is?
There was some testimony about your father.
The treatments on your mother.
What is accurate testimony?
I guess .. right.
You see for yourself?
Not all.
Clearly, but ...
He was cruel to my mother and it was very scary.
And he called stupid.
He was said ugly.
What about the physical violence?
Did you see it?
No.
No, but I heard his voice.
Honourable.
Who is this ... ?
Continue.
I heard all.
And I saw everything.
I often hear is ...
Blow ...
Then I heard my mother scream.
And the next day he's wearing ...
Necklace like being in July ...
Some did not even get out of the room altogether.
By the time your father died ...
You went home early.
Because soccer practice is canceled.
Oh, yes. It is true.
It ...
And return for more reform.
- And you - then that I did.
Tell the jury with a bang.
The trip ...
Did something happen on the trip?
What happened Mike?
I am really...
Really stupid to think it will not happen again.
Why ?
What stopped?
There are doors ...
There is a private door ... on the plane and ...
And my dad pulled.
We are in a private place, you can put it that way.
He knows ...
He knows ...
When I was in college ...
He will not be able to do it again.
Doing what, Mike?
Rape me.
Forgive me ...
He was not able to rape me again.
I love my father first.
I love him.
I...
Will do anything ...
Whatever according to his will.
When ?
When did it start, Mike?
When I was 12 years old
At the start when I was 12 years old.
Where the flight stewardess when this all happened.
I do not remember, I do not know ...
Mike ...
This ...
This ...
Harassment ...
Did you ever tell him about it?
No ...
No ...
I'm embarrassed.
Mike when you come home at the day of the murder ...
And you get to the room parents, ...
What did your father do?
I think he was packing.
So there is no current threat to you.
He told me to get ready ...
While in the air he said, when we get home ...
He would do it again, before I went to college.
Did he threaten you'll abuse you at the time.
He always threatened me, ...
As he did, so far.
Micheal what you're in danger at the time.
Yes at that time ...
Yes, he threatened me.
He always threatened.
Yes or no, boy?
Ya.
Ya.
There are no more questions, sir.
Leblanc redials Angela Morley.
With rising DeLux he would arrive here tomorrow morning.
- Shit. - Yes.
That's a big problem.
You're rough on flight stewardess when first trial ....
Now he will come again.
You've got a choice.
What's that ?
Let him do.
It is true.
I felt guilty menpersulit the child.
If he told his father about the abuse before the conference ...
I will try this case in order Leblanc defeated.
So he will be free.
It would be a recognition of Mike against Angela Morley.
What is certain is her plan all along.
So you were there or with a passenger.
Ya.
So on the plane a door.
Yes, there ...
I closed the door to, for personal matters as requested.
- What is always closed during the flight? - No.
So you can see Mike and Boone Lassiter for 6 hours.
Yes, of course.
Nona Morley ...
Is Boone Lassiter sexually harassing her ...
At any point during the flight?
No.
What he touched her inappropriately ...
Did he do something more severe?
No.
You notice that?
Not just notice, in fact, I will stop him.
No ...
Mr. Lassiter would never do anything like that.
thanks.
Ask her about Kinsburg.
Saksimu ...
Nona Morley ...
How many flights a week are you serving?
Variance ...
Sometimes one or two times, sometimes not at all.
At that time ....
Weekend at the end of the month of January, you remember how many times do you fly?
It was crowded, I do not remember.
So, you ...
Often fly ...
Certainly very tiring.
Do you have a question Miss Bradley?
Have you ever fallen asleep at the time of flight?
I had to keep awake. That is my job.
I do all the professional just in case ...
I take this ...
Tell me Miss Morley ...
Who are its pilot on a flight from LA?
Kapten Green dan Co-pilot Kinsburg.
Did you spend time in the cockpit with them?
Maybe ...
Perhaps, one or two minutes.
Do you often fly with them?

What do you socialize?
During a layover?

Pilot your friends.
Of course.
We are friends.
What you really have a personal relationship with a co-pilot Kinsburg?
Objection your honor, ...
Lawyers wanted to convince what about this?
Miss Bradley, I do not see why such a question.
Judge if he had a personal relationship with Co pilot Kinsburg ...
It may be necessary ...
Call him to be heard ...
A statement ....
What was discussed.
What are they talking about.
I will allow.
I do not know.
I...
I do not know how much time I was there.
Recalling the flight time.
Maybe during ....
10 minutes.
Just 10 minutes.
Or longer?
Could have been longer, I'm not sure.
More than once during the flight?
May be.
Thank you .... Miss Morley.
Please go back to your place ...
Give it to me, I'll bring them. when did you send him?
- Not bad. - No, wait ..bukan ...
You know the place was there linkages.
You do not know he's there was a relationship with the place.
I told you no point we have female lawyers

What is wrong ?
What if ......

Do not get carried away with yourself.
You told everyone a lie, benar'kan?
Are not all these people including Mike?
He testified and the defense, .. okay
I'll go to the hotel, to meet tomorrow
Masterful.
Can I have a ...
Great in there.
thanks.
It must be very heavy when I heard.
What do you know, what would Mike say?
Of course I do not know.
I was awake until the evening, why until I did not see the incident?
Is ....
Maybe he ....
Do not say the actual incident ...
Why did he do it?
It was a horrible situation ...
For both of you ...
No one will blame you both.
I feel ...
Maybe ...
Mike wants to protect you.
As I do ...
As I did.
No, Mike ... Mother listen to me, please listen, bu ..
- It means the only - This is all a mistake mother ...
- As I do ... - No, Mike ... not.
I do not know what you're thinking right now.
But your theory is wrong.
Wait ....
Your job is ...
Is representing my son.
Meneleponmu your given?
Ramsey ...
Is Loretta call?
Ya.
Did he tell you what I'm saying?
Ya.
He told me to fire you.
I can not tell him ...
You can not, after what you did in court.
It is normal when there is madness at the end of the trial.
Do not you worry.
I accused him of killing her husband, did she mention that?
Ya.
What if Mike does not stab his father ...
As well as his defense is also false, since he was not abused.
Ya.
Ya?
Ya ...
It may be true.
I do not know.
Why in mind.
I know, I was a spoiled child's chance of liberating.
Looks like you're protecting him.
I'm working on penutupanku argument.
Did you know?
Because you know, .. you're protecting him.
Wait, calm down, okay?
I ask for your help to keep this child from prison.
You will do as you promised me ....
Representing our clients ... Mike.
He should not be in court.
You do not know it, because you were not there.
Who do we represent this ...
Mike or Loretta ...
Good ...
Now you're scaring me.
This is not about Loretta.
This is about you ...
What ?
Is Loretta as a trigger for you?
Because of this what you fired from your company?
What are you doing.
Good luck, Ramsey.
You want to go?
You want to go?
Now ...
You promised me.
What about the judges?
What about Mike?
The impact on the jury who saw the trust ...
Leaving the defense table could not fantasize.
I hope that the brilliant daughter of Walter Bradley was willing to think about this.
For some purposes all the counsel for the accused ...
Must choose ...
Between knowing the actual truth, ...
And the interests of its clients.
But I'm more concerned about Janelle than it should be.
All stand.
Occasionally something could explode.
It is called a trigger,
Triggers of violence ...
Mike Lassiter, she was in shock when I go home.
2 days later it exploded ....
That's what happened here is not abuse ...
You heard from the flight attendants ...
Did not happen on the plane ...
And if it does not happen ...
How do we know what happened ...
Where's the proof?
The defendant should be illegal prodigi,
Still unproven until now.
Nothing at all.
There was no physical evidence to support his defense.
None.
Michael Lassiter act in anger.
He had planned beforehand.
And there was no intention to kill.
Do your duty ...
Guilty.
Guilty of first degree murder.
thanks.
Ya.
Michael Lassiter killed his father.
Not so with the facts here.
That means you have to decide ...
Is why ....
You heard it yourself ...
Michael said ...
That he would do anything ...
Whatever the will of his father.
Then why ...
I asked Michael.
Is it because of violence on her by her father.
And Michael said no.
No.
Then Michael told ...
For the first time.
Something unimaginable in his life.
That father abused him.
Acting rude to him.
Keeps getting repeated.
And at the time of his father.
With him on the plane.
Do it again ...
Before he entered college.
Something inside Michael.
Say no ....
Not wanting again.
I ask to you ...
To be fair ...
And something right.
Have a child is home with her mother.
The defendant ...
Not guilty ...
And deliver him from this nightmare.
I think it will hurt the feelings of Boone.
When I became a lawyer accused.
From the personal to hurt him.
But he never said it.
Glad if anyone in contact if you were in Duy.
He buy me nice clothes for the first time.
Mengngatkan me to shower every day.
Cut hair.
He knows where I'm from.
The jury was present.
Michael ...
Whatever happened to you ...
Still nothing we can try, okay?
What we are going to appeal?
Teima you very much.
One question ...
What father would beat you?
It is true, Mikey.
Everything stands.
Bring them in.
Jury.
Do you already have the results.
Already ...
Take it ...
- What has been agreed? - Yes.
Already I are doing.

Why do not we go from here.
He wants to talk to me first.
Okay.
The jury believed in Mike.
No matter the facts in law.
They decide what they think is right.
How do you feel ?
What is this ?
It's your watch.
Under the bed.
Are you there ...
In the bedroom when my father comes home.
You are there and kill him.
Tell me you who killed my father.
Mike you know, if I do not do it.
You killed him and you do not admit it.
I will tell everything to the DA.
What will you tell me, Mike?
If you look at his watch.
There was no proof.
They can not punish anyone.
Let me show you ...
Graves, coronary ...
They swear, ...
You swear ...
I could not believe including myself.
Murderer of my father, I was even saved.
Reply me.
Stop.
You want me to go to jail.
You would not be in prison ...
All done. You are free.
