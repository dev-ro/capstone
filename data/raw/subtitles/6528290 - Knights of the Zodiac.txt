In days of legend,
gods walked the Earth...
and tormented mortals.
Athena, goddess of warfare and wisdom,
had the power to destroy humanity,
but chose to protect us.
Brave young knights from across the globe
swore their allegiance to her.
They learned to harness Cosmo...
the power of the stars.
Their fists cracked to the heavens
in battles against those
who wished Athena dead.
Over time...
the gods retreated and became myths.
But then, 18 years ago,
Athena was reborn as a helpless child.
A knight clad in gold armor
gave his life to protect her
as they crashed to Earth.
And that's how I found her,
lying in his arms.
A mortal girl with the power of a god.
Since then,
I've been searching
for a new generation of knights
to protect Athena and the Earth.
We fight to protect ourselves.
But we also fight to protect each other.
There's always something bigger
than you, Seiya.
You'll have to fight
to protect that as well.
You give up?
Never!
Nice try. But not tonight.
-Tap out.
-No!
You must learn when to quit!
Never!
No, Seiya! Don't!
Promise you won't come out.
I promise.
Hey, kid!
Come on, you're up next.
You win this fight,
maybe you get a shot at me someday.
Hey! Listen to me.
No more of that dancing around,
you understand?
You make it a good show this time.
Fight this time, asshole.
It's time for the main event!
Introducing first,
the undisputed champion of the Octagon.
Give it up for Jaki the Beast!
Jaki! Jaki! Jaki!
And the contender,
who literally danced his way
through his first two fights,
let's hear it for Street Kid Seiya!
You both know how this works.
You know the rules. There are none.
Anything goes until one of you
gives up or blacks out.
If you give up,
you're banished from the Octagon.
Understood?
Damn it, fight!
Hey! I said, no dancing!
Cassios! Cassios! Cassios!
What, you think you can just ignore me?
Okay, calm down, big guy.
Ballet's over, kid.
Cassios wins.
Every...
single...
time.
Cassios! Cassios! Cassios!
You give up?
Yeah!
You don't know when to quit, huh?
Yeah.
I've heard that before.
We're not done here!
This ain't over!
Come outside.
You're cute, but you're not my type, man.
There's someone outside
that wants to speak with you.
He knows about your search.
He knows what you're looking for.
Give me that.
Yeah, it's me.
Think I found one of your Cosmo guys.
I'm out of here.
Your little show in there made
some people upset.
Look, I'm not looking for trouble.
You may not be looking,
but you've found it.
In a few moments,
Vander Guraad will be here with her boys.
Who?
My ex-wife.
She controls this fighting ring.
It's her recruitment operation.
What does she recruit?
Warriors with special skills.
For her private army.
Okay.
I saw what you did in the ring.
I knew it had to be you, Seiya.
Who are you?
I'm the only friend you have.
You need to make a choice, Seiya.
Come with me or try your luck
against Guraad's warriors.
Lead the way.
Come on!
Look what we've found.
What are those guys made of?
You don't want to know. Keep moving!
Our ride's just around the corner!
Get down!
Go!
Meet Mylock, my assistant.
Those guys work for your ex-wife?
Surrender the boy!
Dude, you gotta make better life choices.
What the hell is that thing?
Hope you had a light dinner.
Why are they after me?
They're after warriors
with a strong Cosmo.
Cosmo? Is that a new martial arts
or something?
You should know.
You tapped into it in the Octagon.
I didn't tap into anything.
They got the wrong guy!
Oh, would you like us to stop
and let them know?
God!
Hold on tight!
I am not going another step
until you tell me what's going on.
There'll be time for that later.
We're still in danger.
You're really--
Okay, okay, okay. Go to sleep.
Hey. Hey. Wake up. Wake up.
Wake up. Come on.
You need to hide. No matter what happens,
you stay out of sight.
I have to make sure
these people don't find you.
Promise you won't come out.
Okay. I promise.
Thank you.
For what?
You tapped into your Cosmo.
No, Seiya. Don't!
Led me right to your doorstep.
Saved me so much trouble.
Let's go!
Let's go!
You can't use it. Only the Pegasus can!
That's why you're coming with us.
Relax.
Relax, we're safe now.
Safe?
First I get attacked by ninja cyborgs,
then I got a spaceship shooting at me.
And then that freak in a suit drugs me!
Allow me to rephrase it.
You're safer here than with Guraad.
She has already captured
many kids like you,
drained them of their Cosmo.
Stop talking nonsense
and tell me what's going on!
-Prepare for landing.
-What?
You might want to buckle up.
No, I want answers now!
Oh, shit.
There's no runway!
I said, you might want to buckle up.
You couldn't just tell me
this thing lands vertically?
Let's start afresh, shall we?
My name is Alman Kido.
Once upon a time, I was a businessman.
Mylock, let her know our guest
has arrived, please.
Yes, sir.
Should I believe you went bust?
I won't hide the fact
I've been quite successful in my trade.
But the one thing
money can't buy is purpose.
So this is where you store your "purpose"?
Yes.
Tell me, Seiya, what do you see?
I'm not sure.
A whole bunch of real old stuff, I guess.
I see stories.
Ancient heroes were defined
by their monumental deeds
as much as by their tragic ends.
I always admired
the formidable magnitude of their fate.
I envied it. I used to think
the ancient lore held no secret for me.
I'm afraid that was my hubris.
What do you know about Athena?
-She was a god of war.
-And wisdom.
What if I told you
Athena had returned in human form
and you are destined
to become one of her guardian knights?
I'd say your therapist isn't worth
his paycheck.
Things happen for a reason, Seiya.
Your Cosmo brought you here.
Actually, I was brought here
on a very expensive aircraft.
And now I'm leaving on my own two feet.
You know the truth in your heart, Seiya.
Your sister knew it too.
What do you know about my sister?
Ten years ago,
Guraad detected a strong Cosmo
at your location.
She thought it was Patricia.
What did she do to her?
I don't know,
but your sister gave herself up
so that Guraad wouldn't find you.
She knew what you were to become.
A warrior of Athena. The Pegasus Knight.
The Pegasus Knight?
You're really out of your mind.
That doesn't bode well.
This is Sienna.
Guraad is after her too.
Your mission is to protect her.
I can take care of myself.
Why would I ever want
to risk my neck to protect some rich girl?
Because our little Sienna here is
the reincarnation of the goddess Athena.
-Dad.
-Don't you have something for our guest?
Sure, a toilet,
so he can flush himself out.
Wow, spoken like a true goddess.
Dad, come on. This moron can't
seriously be the Pegasus Knight.
Go on.
Fine.
You might recognize this, Seiya.
This is Patricia's.
That is the key to the Pegasus armor.
Without it, you don't stand a chance
against Guraad's army.
I could've handled those guys.
That's not what Mylock said.
So how's this supposed
to help me find my sister?
You give me a little present
and expect me to help you out?
My plan is to trust you
to do what is right.
And what would that be?
I suppose you've never heard of Marin,
the Silver Knight.
God, another one of your old legends?
Marin can teach you how to reveal
the hidden secret of the pendant.
So you can protect Sienna,
and yourself, against your enemies.
And maybe even help you find your sister.
Ancient gods. Magic knights.
Do you have any idea
how totally insane you sound?
I know, it is a lot to take in, isn't it?
So why don't we have breakfast,
take the day off and...
revisit this tomorrow. Yeah.
Well, I am hungry, but...
A goddess's fate is on the line, but sure.
Let's eat pancakes.
Yeah.
Get off my ring, you scum.
Get out of my ring!
You moron.
You were supposed to keep a low profile.
And I did.
We need to shut this place down.
-You don't get to decide that!
-That's right. I do.
Guraad, come on.
We have a great partnership.
Yes. We did.
How's the boy's Cosmo?
It's legit.
Good news. I've got a new deal for you.
No ring, no deal.
All the better.
Nobody needs a loser who gets
his ass kicked by a scrawny kid.
He got a lucky break.
No man gets lucky twice with Cassios.
I can beat anyone, anytime.
Well, let's see if that's true.
Something wrong?
I just don't know how you can breathe
while you're eating like that.
Where I come from, you eat
as much as you can, when you can.
You never know
where your next meal's coming from.
You wouldn't understand.
Rich girl.
No, I wouldn't.
But I'm sorry you had to live like that.
Sir. There's an urgent call.
Please excuse me.
So...
How does it feel to be a goddess?
Well, I'm not a goddess yet.
Just Sienna.
But her Cosmo is getting stronger
by the day,
and someday soon I will become Athena.
Most people would be excited
to have breakfast with a future goddess.
Guess I'm not most people, then.
Well, then maybe you should--
Maybe I should what?
You should back off.
Jeez, don't be so sensitive.
Just get away from me, okay?
-Okay, I'm sorry.
-Just get away--
Hey!
Dad!
Hey!
-Are you okay?
-Wait!
What's going on?
She could kill you right now.
I'm here, sweetheart, just relax.
What just happened?
She bears a goddess's Cosmo
in the body of a mortal.
When our sensors detect
a potential Cosmo burst,
the building automatically
blocks the signal.
It's the only way we can keep
Sienna hidden from Guraad.
Which is why I am stuck here
like a prisoner.
Excuse me.
Wait. Wait, so... So you really are...?
You really think this guy could beat
the Pegasus Knight?
Perhaps. If we give him the prototype.
Next candidate?
You giving up already?
What the hell are you made of?
Disengage.
We ain't done yet.
You made your point, Cassios.
You're a strong man.
But you're just a man.
I have a problem.
You met him in your ring.
The kid.
His power's a liability.
Once he learns to control it,
no living man will be able to stop him.
What, you think I could, though?
You know, with your prototype thing?
I have a good ear.
So, what's your price?
Well, that depends.
Can I kill him?
That's kind of the point.
I'll do it for free.
-You all right?
-I'm better.
-You?
-I'm good. I guess.
It's just that I can't believe
you really are a--
A goddess?
I'm never gonna call you that.
That's fine with me.
So how do people usually react
when they learn you're Athena?
Varies.
Like, the day after I was born,
someone tried to kill me.
No.
Not even you could annoy someone
that much in just one day.
I was told a knight in gold armor
gave his life to save mine.
When they found him,
he was still holding me in his arms.
Who found you? Alman?
And Guraad.
Though she was a little more
into the gold armor.
Used it to develop technology
far beyond anything you could imagine.
Look at the bright side.
Half your foster family is great.
When Alman's around you,
he almost looks like a real dad.
Alman is my dad, and I love him
more than anything in the world.
Although that might be hard
for you to understand, street boy.
I do.
I had someone like that once.
Your sister?
What was she like?
She was kind.
And strong.
And protected me
when I couldn't protect myself.
And you won't stop until you find her.
You really don't care that I've become
your bodyguard, do you?
I will someday become Athena.
I don't have a choice.
But that doesn't mean you have
to become the Pegasus Knight.
Alman said it's my destiny.
Nobody's destiny is written in stone.
Except yours.
Your Cosmo bursts,
do they come with visions?
You have visions too?
What does it matter?
Cosmo visions are a window
into the universe.
They can show us things.
So that Silver Knight
your dad mentioned...?
-Who, Marin?
-Marin.
Do you think if he could teach me
to control my Cosmo,
I could use it to find my sister?
Maybe.
If that's what you want.
He's drained of Cosmo, Guraad.
Won't get another dose.
The prototype procedure has started.
It'll be ready tomorrow.
Any issues?
Just one.
Why Cassios?
'Cause you failed.
You know, the target was assisted
by Alman Kido.
A personal bad penny.
Athena's growing stronger by the day,
and now she'll have
the Pegasus Knight by her side.
I reckon the boy's got some Cosmo.
Doesn't mean he's a knight yet.
I don't need cold comfort, Nero.
I need to know where on Earth
Alman is hiding the girl.
So we can neutralize her
before she becomes Athena
and destroys the world.
Beats me.
But you could always ask our prisoner.
We have a prisoner?
Hey!
Hey, wait up.
Yeah?
I... I just figured you could focus more
on your training if you weren't
worried about where your next meal
was coming from.
Thanks.
Thank you.
I guess.
Seiya!
Time to go.
See you.
Take a seat.
Don't get any big ideas.
Goddesses don't have boyfriends.
-How many dads does Sienna have?
-Buckle up.
Lunchbox?
That's unusually kind of you.
I just thought
he might as well enjoy his last meal,
since Marin's probably
gonna kill him anyway.
Right.
So where am I supposed to go?
Okay. Just drop me off up there.
Not how it works.
"Those who seek the master
must do so on foot."
What the hell am I doing here?
I was wondering the same thing.
You must be Marin.
-The Silver Knight.
-You look surprised.
Yeah. No, I'm... I mean...
No offense, I thought you'd be a man.
No offense taken.
I thought the same of you.
What's the training schedule like here?
I only train knights.
I'm told I'm the Pegasus Knight.
You're not the first boy
with a pretty necklace to show up here.
Is there a test I can take or something?
The Pegasus Knight is brave.
Check.
Humble.
Check.
And committed
to protecting Athena with his life.
Okay, that's where this whole situation
gets a little sticky.
See, I lost my sister-- Hey!
I just got up here!
I just got up here.
I'm not going down there.
There's nothing for you here.
What are you? Like, a ninja?
Listen, I only wanna find my sister.
Sienna said you could help.
I knew a knight just like you.
He desired power for his own goals.
-Which was?
-The Phoenix.
The most powerful of Athena's knights.
You mean, aside from the Pegasus Knight.
I'll have Mylock come get you
in the morning.
No. Come on, I made it this far.
And how far is that?
Do you even know how far you need to go?
Just give me one chance.
If you can break this rock...
then you can be my student.
Fair enough.
Where's the hammer?
Come on, I can't break a rock
with my bare hands.
A knight could.
You can't be serious.
You're serious.
I told you, this was stupid!
Your flesh, this rock,
the stars in the sky,
all things in the cosmos are made
from the same atoms.
From the moment we are born,
we all hold a Cosmo within ourselves.
A knight can make it explode.
And shatter the atoms of any object.
How's that supposed to make any sense?
Focus.
Clear your mind.
Feel the Cosmo within you.
Seiya!
This is stupid, it'll never work!
Something clouded your focus
at the last minute.
Figures. Guess I'm not
the Pegasus Knight after all.
No, you're not.
But maybe you will be.
Are you ready to start your training?
It's a good thing he didn't mind
the permanent changes to his body.
-Well...
-What?
I might have forgotten to mention
the permanent part to him.
What the hell is this?
What did you do? You made--
You made me a freaking cyborg!
What is that?
It's the curse of Athena.
The war that awaits us is unlike
any other before.
Our enemies are the gods themselves.
We've all made sacrifices.
But what is flesh in comparison
to the power to crush the immortals?
A war with the gods, huh?
There's only one person I wanna crush.
Well, that was a nice little show.
Let's move on.
We have bigger issues at hand.
-Bigger than his ego?
-Your prisoner.
He's a tough one. I can't get him to talk.
-Any ideas?
-Have you tried asking nicely?
Let's get a baseline.
Show me what you know.
You mean, fight you? Now?
You came here to train, yes?
Is dancing all you can do?
Shouldn't I have a weapon or something?
Athena's knights wield no weapon.
That sucks.
Okay, I felt that one.
It wasn't a direct hit.
How the hell'd you do that?
You want a weapon?
Your Cosmo is your weapon.
Focus your energy,
let it burn inside of you.
Release it all at once.
Like a shooting star.
Felt more like a meteor shower to me.
So do I get to learn
this meteor fist of yours?
You must...
if you want to survive
the battles that await you.
Sienna!
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.
I'm here. It's all right.
I had another vision. Bad one.
It's okay, it's all gone now.
Dad...
How can you be so sure
I'll grow up to protect the world?
You are the goddess of wisdom, remember?
And warfare.
And you're my baby girl.
The most loving and stubborn.
Nothing could stop you
from doing what's right.
What did you see?
People... burning.
Cities in ruins.
Everything...
destroyed.
We won't let that happen, will we?
You don't understand. It was Athena.
She was doing it. I...
I was doing it.
Visions are just... possibilities.
Dad, I know you'd let
the world burn to keep me safe...
but what if that's not me anymore?
Prove to me you're worthy. Focus.
Is that all you've got?
Your body is here.
But your mind is elsewhere.
Seiya.
There's so many things I need to tell you.
I'm here to protect you.
Now stop my attack.
You're failing.
Was he a knight too?
The Pegasus?
Mind and body must become one.
A knight's power comes from within.
You give up?
If you can't do this,
you'll never be a knight.
You give up?
How did you say you ended up here, again?
I didn't say. And it's none of your--
Right, I'm not supposed to know. I know.
My destiny is bound to this island.
Well, that sounds like a lonely existence.
But not one without purpose.
You know, I...
I have a purpose too.
To find my sister.
A knight should not mistake
obsession for purpose.
I know there is pain in your past...
but beyond that pain,
there lies your strength.
Find it and the armor will accept you.
This is what your sister would've wanted.
Get some sleep.
I get it.
You're tough.
You know, someone once taught me
that all men, no matter how tough,
have something they fear.
I wonder what it is
a big man like you fears the most.
Who are you?
You have no idea what I'm capable of.
Make it stop.
Make it stop!
Make it go away.
Now...
would you mind telling me
where I can find Alman Kido?
Make it stop!
-This one's bigger than the last one.
-And your Cosmo is stronger.
Now, show me what you've learned.
You did it, Seiya.
The Pegasus armor is--
You can't use it. Only the Pegasus can.
That's why you're coming with us.
Alman.
He was a part of it.
He was there when Guraad took Patricia.
I want off this island.
You are not ready.
Your training is not over.
It is now.
Alman's been playing me for a fool!
You must calm down.
If your heart and mind aren't clear,
the armor will reject you.
To hell with the armor!
Seiya.
I don't care.
You can either kill me now...
or send me back.
Let's go. One more round, guys.
Come on.
How's it coming along?
You want this to work, I need more time.
Be careful, you idiot!
Yeah, running out of sparring partners.
You care to join?
Oh, I'm sorry. Busy day.
Right, right. You're playing
with your god-killing toy over here.
Yeah.
So much trouble for one little girl.
You know, if you ask me,
I'd be more than happy to snap her neck
the old-fashioned way.
Any damage to Sienna's body
might awaken Athena's Cosmo within her.
Yeah, I don't even know what that means.
It means you can't dismantle
a nuclear bomb by smashing it with a club.
I'd sure love to try.
It's not happening.
Make it work.
Alman!
I know what you did!
-Come face me, you coward.
-Stand down!
I'll handle this.
-Seiya, please.
-Alman!
Please calm down.
Stand back!
You can't hide from me.
Seiya!
He took Patricia. He was in on it.
There's more to it than that.
No! No, you don't wanna do that.
You don't understand.
Come with me. I'll tell you
what really happened to your sister.
Sienna, you know the rules.
You must not leave the mansion grounds.
You said you have answers.
Hey!
Alman was there when Guraad took Patricia.
He was a part of it.
Tell me I'm wrong.
He did it because of me.
When I was younger,
I had no control at all.
One night, my mom was holding me
and I had a burst of Cosmo.
I don't even know how it happened.
All I remember is she was holding me
and I destroyed her arms.
And the next moment,
she was dying and it was all my fault.
Alman used the power
of the gold armor to save her,
but ever since the accident,
Guraad needs Cosmo to stay alive.
So what? You've got plenty of it.
Athena's Cosmo's too powerful.
It would kill her.
That's why she sought out kids
like your sister.
What did she do to Pat?
Your sister didn't have any Cosmo.
Once Guraad figured that out,
she let her go.
But she sent her men to watch her.
Guraad knew Patricia was hiding something.
Me.
That's why she never came back.
Look, I'm sorry, Seiya. If I knew, I...
My mother was never the same
after the incident.
She became convinced that Athena
had returned to this world to end it.
She was gonna kill me,
so my father forced me into hiding.
And left Pat behind.
Your sister wasn't the only one.
We left them all behind.
How many kids did your family take?
Our radar picked up Guraad's signature.
So it is happening.
We don't stand a chance.
You need to get out of here.
I'll buy you as much time as I can.
I'm not running from a fight.
Find Sienna.
Protect her.
You're the only one I can trust.
And, Mylock?
You've been a good friend.
Thank you.
After Pat was taken, I ran away.
All these years,
I've never stopped looking for her.
Turns out she was the one
who was keeping away from me.
Your sister sacrificed herself
because she believed
in what you really are.
I never asked to be a knight.
I only wanted to be with Pat.
You think I wanted any of this?
Sometimes I feel like
I'm a guest in my own body.
In time,
I thought I'd learn to control it.
But you're fighting it.
What if my mother was right?
What if I was only born
to bring ruin and misery into this world?
That's not who you are.
How do you know?
I guess I just know.
I need you to promise me...
if things go wrong...
if, in the end, I become a goddess of war
and I can't control my powers...
you will stop me, at all costs.
-You don't mean--
-Just promise me, please.
That's my mother.
Sienna, wait, you can't go back!
-You're the one she's after.
-I have to help my father.
Okay.
I'm with you.
For now.
Shut it! Shut it!
Hold.
Don't let them through!
No! No--!
It's clear.
Where's Seiya?
And whatever her name is?
Sienna is not here,
but I am willing to make a deal.
Old man, you are in no position
to be making deals.
Wait outside, Cassios.
-Are you serious?
-Out!
Hey!
I really need to get to this ship.
Glad you understand.
How do you like my special bullets?
Let's make this easy, shall we?
Just tell me where she is.
Straight to business, then.
What do you expect,
after she almost killed me?
That was an accident and you know it.
You can't blame Sienna for it.
Oh, I never blamed Sienna.
I blamed you, Alman,
for leaving me
to make all the hard choices.
How is murdering a little girl
even a choice?
She's a sword of Damocles
hanging over all of us.
-She's your daughter.
-We never had a daughter!
What we had was an agreement, remember?
That when she'd go out of control,
we'd do whatever had to be done together.
Sienna was entrusted to me.
I'm responsible for her.
I believe in her.
You must believe in our child too.
What about all the children
you took to make these?
Weren't you responsible for them?
It was the only way to save you.
And now I must save
the rest of us from her.
Speaking of the devil.
Dad?
I didn't want to do this,
but I won't let you hurt her.
I know.
Cassios!
Enough!
Get me the girl.
You can do what you want with the boy.
Seiya!
We need to go.
Hey there. I'm gonna take the girl now.
But first, I want you.
Let's end this now.
-No, Seiya. Don't.
-It's okay.
I've got the armor.
Any time now.
Sienna, stay back!
Things have changed, kid.
Face it, you don't have what it takes.
I loved these glasses.
Stop! Stop!
You've won.
I'm coming with you. Let him go.
You're coming with me anyway.
Rescue on the way, kids.
I'm sorry,
but I'm taking you down with me.
Go! Go! Go!
No.
It's ready.
Give me a minute.
Leave.
You must think
I'm the worst mother in the world.
You... You killed Father.
Alman chose his own way,
and left me
to clean up his mess, as always.
Athena's Cosmo is too strong.
It won't fix you.
I know.
Yeah. I gave up
on fixing this body a long time ago.
We both have a bomb ticking inside.
Except yours is gonna be so much louder
if we let it go off.
I know I'm doing the right thing.
I just wanted you to know
it doesn't make it any easier.
Will it hurt much?
I don't know.
We need to start.
Do it.
Sienna...
That ain't gonna help, kiddo.
I let her get taken.
I failed.
We all did.
I was supposed to protect her.
Things don't always work out
the way we expect them to.
Come on, Seiya.
Marin.
You were right about me.
I failed.
I'm not a knight.
I couldn't save her.
A knight should not mistake
obsession for purpose.
Seiya, focus.
Who is it that you're trying to save?
Pat.
What does this...?
Who are you really trying to save?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I know.
It's okay.
It wasn't your fault.
Okay.
I'll bring her back.
I promise.
Okay.
Let's go get Sienna back.
How long will it take?
To kill a god? Good question.
We're about to find out.
Oh, boy. They got us on radar.
-What?
-Get ready.
For what?
I can get you close, but I can't land.
Parachute?
Who says you're not funny?
It's now or never!
Open the doors.
Get yourself out of here!
Godspeed, kiddo.
-Out of the way.
-Hey!
He's mine.
Big deal. You know how to glow.
Step aside, Cassios,
if you don't wanna get hurt.
Hurt?
You should've died
when you had the chance.
What was it that you said, Cassios?
Right.
Oh, no.
Things have changed.
Finally,
the goddess Athena reveals herself.
You must believe in our child too.
Stop! Stop the procedure!
It'll be over soon.
Now!
We are not stopping!
Get out of my way.
Guards!
Your services are no longer required.
There's no stopping it now.
In moments,
she'll be nothing but a memory.
Kill him!
You said it yourself, Guraad.
When one goes to war with the gods,
sacrifices must be made.
There must be another way
to protect humanity.
Protect humanity?
Is that what you think you're doing?
Killing Athena was only
half of the battle.
This is the other half.
The gold armor.
Can't let you do that.
Thought you were the only knight in town?
You gotta get out of the way.
Sienna!
You're no match for the Phoenix.
Why do you try so hard?
She's not worth it.
She's not even human.
Sienna's not a god of war.
I don't care what kind of god she is.
Man needs no gods!
You don't know when to quit.
People keep telling me that.
Stop, you fool!
Sienna!
Listen to me!
That's not your friend anymore!
She's become the goddess of war.
We have to stop her!
Seiya.
I'm losing control.
I don't think
I can hold her back much longer.
You can't save me,
but you can stop Athena.
You must do it now.
At all costs.
Sienna...
you're not a goddess of war.
No one's destiny...
is written in stone.
Not even yours.
The guardian of mankind...
or a petulant jerk...
whatever you choose to be,
I'll never give up on you.
Seiya.
What? Why?
-What was that for?
-Who's the petulant jerk?
Oh, my...
Okay.
-Get up.
-Okay.
Let's get out of here.
Wait.
I'm sorry.
I was wrong about you.
I wasn't so sure myself
for a very long time.
You didn't have to do that.
Yes, I did.
Did I do this?
Mylock!
Sienna!
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
Glad you made it, Seiya.
You too.
So, boss...
what do we do now?
Athena's awakening is a sign the old gods
will soon return and try to start a war.
We need to gather all the Knights
of the Zodiac to stop them.
I'm at your service, my lord.
Stop. Don't call me that.
Whatever you say, princess.
No. And definitely not that.
Before we gather the knights,
there's something else we need to do.
What's that?
It's time to find Patricia.
Thank you.
It's the least a goddess could do.
