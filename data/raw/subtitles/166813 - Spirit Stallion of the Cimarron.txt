SPIRIT: The story that I want to
tell you cannot be found in a book.
They say the history of the west was
written from the saddle of a horse,
but it's never been told
from the heart of one...
Not till now.
I was born here
in this place that would come
to be called the old west
but to my kind,
the land was ageless.
It had no beginning and no end,
no boundary between earth and sky.
Like the wind in the buffalo grass
we belonged here.
We would always belong here.
They say the mustang is
the spirit of the west.
Whether that west was
won or lost in the end
you'll have to decide for yourself
but the story I want
to tell you is true.
I was there, and I remember.
I remember the sun and the sky
and the wind calling my name
in a time when wild
horses ran free.

(FLY LIKE AN EAGLE PLAYING)
I hear the wind
Call my name
(WHINNIES)
The sound that leads me home again
It sparks up the fire
A flame that still burns
To you I will always return
I know the road is long
But where you are is home
Wherever you stay
I'll find the way
I'll run like the river
I'll follow the sun
I'll fly like an eagle
To where I belong
I can't stand the distance
I can't dream alone
I can't wait to see you
Yes, I'm on my way home
Now I know it's true
My every road leads to you
And in the hour of darkness
Your light gets me through
You run like the river
You shine like the sun
Yeah
You fly like an eagle
Yeah, you are the one
I've seen every sunset
And with all that I've learned
Oh...
It's to you I will always
Always return
(HERE I AM PLAYING)
Here I am
This is me
There's nowhere else on
Earth I 'd rather be
Here I am
It's just me and you
Tonight we make
Our dreams come true
It's a new world
It's a new start
It's alive with the beating
Of young hearts
It's a new day
It's a new plan
I've been waiting for you
Here I am
Here I am
Here we are
We've just begun
And after all this time
Our time has come
Yeah, here we are
Still going strong
Right here in the
place where we belong
It's a new world
It's a new start
It's alive with the beating
Of young hearts
It's a new day
It's a new plan
I've been waiting for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting
Here I am
Baby, here I am
Here I am
Here I am
Here I am
Right next to you
Right next to you
Here I am
And suddenly the world
Is all brand-new
Here I am
Here I am
Whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah
Here I am
Here I am
(DON'T LET GO PLAYING)
I can't believe this moment's come
It's so incredible that we're alone
There's so much to be said and done
It's impossible not to be overcome
Will you forgive me
if I feel this way?
'Cause we just met
Tell me that's okay
So, take this feeling
Make it grow
Never let it
Never let it go
Don't let go...
You give me something
That I can believe in
No, don't let...
Go of this moment in time
Don't let go...
I can't explain the
things that I'm feeling
No, don't let go...
I've been waiting all my life
All my life
To make this moment feel so right
Feel so right
The feel of you just
fills the night
So, come on let's
just hold on tight
Don't let go...
You give me something
that I can believe in
No, don't let...
Go of this moment in time
Don't let go...
I can't explain the
things that I'm feeling
No, don't let...
No, I won't let
Go
No, don't let go...
No, I won't let go
(BROTHERS UNDER THE SUN PLAYING)
I had a dream
Of the wide-open prairie
I had a dream
Of the pale morning sky
I had a dream
That we flew on golden wings
And we were the same
Just the same
You and I
Follow your heart
Little child of the west wind
Follow the voice
That's calling you home
Follow your dreams
But always remember me
I am your brother
Yeah, under the sun
We are
Like birds of a feather
We are
Two hearts joined together
We will be
Forever as one
My brother, under the sun
Under the sun
Under the sun
My brother, under the sun
