Look, you can see
all the different rock layers.
Look, Eddi, there's the cave.
Wow, the mountains are huge.
My new workplace sits at 1,078 meters...
Mom, spare us the lecture.
INSECTS
Yeah.
This seems to be it.
It's the right address.
But it didn't look this shitty
in the photos.
It's only temporary,
until we find something better.
Eddi, please put the snail down.
- This is Nadja.
- But don't bring it into the house, okay?
Welcome to Eisenkappel.
Or rather, Železna Kapla, as we say.
- Ms. Reitsch.
- Thank you.
- Hello, Mr. Röckl.
- And? You're a little rascal, aren't you?
Eddi.
Yeah, those...
Pretty tough, those little buggers.
Excuse me?
The snails. Hard to get rid of, no?
So...
Yeah, let's go have a look
at your new house then.
Yes.
Come on.
Right, this is the kitchen.
Fully equipped.
Lovely, no?
Perfect for the little ones to run around.
True.
This is the furniture we can use?
- The previous tenants left it behind.
- They couldn't wait to get out.
Yeah.
Right.
Right. So as discussed,
I'll keep you updated about...
Oh, God, Eddi.
Such a little rascal, huh?
Yeah, right. Let's go upstairs.
Wait up.
So the wellness area.
The bathroom. Everything in spring green.
We don't want to get
skin cancer or anything.
Oh, I don't know.
I was just joking.
It's pure Carinthian mountain water.
Here, the bathtub, of course.
Protects you from the ghosts.
Just a joke.
It's probably salt.
Yes, for the snails.
It sucks the moisture out of their bodies.
That's the attic?
Hmm? Yes, it is.
But it's closed off because the owner's
private possessions are in there.
This one's mine.
Fine, then this is yours?
Whatever.
Mm.
So...
If you need anything, call me anytime.
- Thanks.
- My home number is on there too.
In case you need a man
around the house.
Have a good evening.
Seriously?
- Something wrong?
- I'm on the Slovenian network.
Yeah, that can happen.
We're right on the border here.
What's that?
What?
That.
Up there? The attic.
Up there is a zombie family!
Mom, Hendrik says
there's a zombie family living up there!
Hendrik, come down
and help us bring things in.
You guys want pizza?
- I'll order us some.
- Coming.
Lord Jesus, I pray that you deliver me
from this curse upon my life.
Through your blood am I delivered.
Eddi.
Hello?
Do you live here too?
You don't need to be afraid.
Eddi,
can you clean up your toys?
See you later.
Pizza's here.
Look, Eddi, I've got new teeth.
Say, "Marmalade. Confiture."
You could spend the next days exploring.
- What's to explore in this shithole?
- Hendrik!
"Hendrik" what? It's true.
There's nothing here.
You don't know that.
Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine?
Everything will be fine?
Nothing will be fine!
I had to leave everything behind
so you can work in that damn cave!
That's enough, okay?
This wouldn't happen with Dad.
Eddi?
What are you doing there?
Eddi.
I have to go to the bathroom.
GENERAL STORE
Hello.
What can I do for you?
- Uh...
- May I help you?
Six bread rolls, please.
Haven't got any.
Bread rolls.
These are buns.
Buns.
Six buns, please.
Dude!
Wonderful.
Yeah, wonderful. Wonderfully quiet.
Nothing's going on here.
Lucky that the holidays are almost over.
So peaceful. I slept like a stone.
I also had a rocky sleep.
No, you were wandering around.
You were sleepwalking?
Maybe it's the new surroundings.
I have to go to the cave,
but let's go see the neighbor first.
No. I made plans to game with my friends.
You need internet for that, don't you?
What?
I'm sorry, the technician isn't coming
until the afternoon.
Ha, ha.
Come on.
Why?
To be polite.
Hello, Sabine Reitsch. This is Hendrik,
Eddi. We wanted to introduce ourselves.
Ehm...
We're the new neighbors.
Let's see if you last longer
than the others.
Politeness.
Sure.
I've got to go now.
- Could you...
- Explore the village?
Maybe you'll get around faster with that?
Rolandi.
Here we go.
Hey.
Dude!
Eddi, what are you doing?
They look like...
Come on.
HERE LIE RALF AND ROLAND POLZMANN
GOOD LUCK
Here we are.
OBIR CAVE
Ah, the organ pipes.
- Won't find this where you're from.
- No.
Well, not so close to us, anyway.
Just exhibitions and slideshows.
Unbelievable.
NO ENTRY! DANGER OF COLLAPSE
Look, Nadja, all those houses!
Hello!
Hello!
Eddi, go play.
Alone?
There are other kids.
You can show them Nadja.
Okay.
- Hello.
- Hello.
What?
My name is Friedrich
but everybody calls me Fritz.
It sounds cooler.
Why are you talking like that?
I thought you would understand me better
if I speak standard German.
You're from Germany, right?
Wow, news sure spreads fast around here.
Yeah, because there usually isn't any.
Hey.
- Hey, Chris.
- Shut it.
Shut it.
Look at this.
The Kraut can't afford a decent bike.
- The what?
- "The what?"
Kraut means stupid German.
- It's an insult for Germans.
- Shut your mouth, dumbass.
Dumbass.
Mommy's calling.
- Give it back, you jerk.
- What did you say?
You've got some guts.
- Did he just call you a jerk?
- Dude!
Don't worry about it.
Chris always acts like an asshole.
He's just jealous.
- Jealous of what?
- My mineral collection.
Okay, spit it out.
Have you seen the ghost yet?
What ghost?
Amalia Polzmann.
Mm?
- You don't know the Polzmanns' story?
- No.
Then I'll tell you.
So it was the summer of 1980.
Amalia Polzmann
was out collecting mushrooms
while her two sons, Ralf and Roland,
were playing innocently in the garden.
When she called them to dinner,
they didn't know yet
that their mother was a psychopath
and put poison in the soup.
After Amalia killed her sons,
she killed herself.
- That's enough.
- He doesn't get it anyway.
Why isn't the mom with her kids
in the cemetery?
- That's how it is. Suicides are...
- Bye, Friedrich.
Fritz!
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Look.
- Eddi, try this.
- What's that woman doing there?
What woman?
What woman?
Al dente.

Family drama in Bad Eisenkappel.
LEARN MORE
A 10-year-old and a 16-year-old,
as well as their mother,
die of mushroom poisoning.
The Slovenian mother of the two victims,
Amalia P...
P.
Polzmann.
... appears to have poisoned
her two children and then herself.
The motive is still unclear.
The mother suffered from mental illness.
That was 40 years ago.
They say the murderer's
haunting this place.
Hendrik, please.
Yeah, and Eddi's sleepwalking?
Don't use your brother
to make me feel guilty.
- Don't tell Eddi about this.
- Yeah, okay.
No, that's not all right,
Mr. Röckl. You should have told me.
I don't care about that.
Well, then goodnight.
Yes, same to you.
Is Dad haunting our old house too?
That's it.
- No, don't call me.
- Don't be silly.
Come on, off to bed.
Hey, Eddi?
Have you been having
strange dreams lately?
- About a woman or something?
- Nadja.
Is that why you drew her on my wall?
What? I didn't draw anything on your wall.
Man, Eddi, this isn't funny.
Man, Eddi, what are you saying?
What's going on in here? Are you okay?
Come on.
It's all right. Mom's here.
"Gobe."
Gobe?
Gobe?
Look at this.
Sounds Slovenian. Something with "Mom."
Thanks, I figured that.
I see. You don't need my help.
Know anyone who could translate it?
Ida.
You coming?
What do you want?
This here is Hendrik from Germany.
He lives in the Polzmann house.
His brother is possessed by a ghost.
- You know Slovenian, right?
- A bit, yes.
"Mom is innocent."
Oh, my God.
Amalia Polzmann is innocent.
Do you know what that means?
- No.
- No.
Polzmann didn't murder her sons.
And Roland and Ralf's real murderer
is still on the loose.
Amalia Polzmann's ghost is trapped inside
your brother and is speaking through him.
But it can't be Amalia. Eddi said, "Mom."
- That means...
- Right. The dead children are speaking.
Uh-oh.
What's the Kraut up to?
Shut up.
You shut up.
What are you laughing at?
- Dude, what's your problem?
- What's my problem?
- Hey!
- What's your problem?
Piss off back to Krautland.
- You Kraut.
- You're such idiots.
Yeah, yeah. Come on.
Blood!
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Everything's fine. I'm fine.
Thank you for asking.
Here.
For your nose.
Wow, that was crazy.
Are those tamp...
Hendrik? Hendrik?
- Yeah?
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God. What happened?
- Basketball.
Hendrik and I have to go upstairs.
You can watch TV.
- Can Nadja watch too?
- Whatever.
Yay!
Basketball, huh?
You know I'm always here for you.
Thanks.
Yes.
Rolandi.
Rolandi.
Rolandi.
Eddi?
Eddi.
- Eddi?
- Eddi?
Eddi!
Your boy went to the cemetery.
Oh, shit.
Eddi!
Do you hear that?
Oh, shit.
Eddi?
What are you doing here? Eddi, come here.
It's okay.
It's okay. Yeah.
Eddi, what were you doing in the cemetery?
The woman called me.
What woman?
The woman?
This is important. What woman?
Come on, da Vinci,
enough drawing. Come on, bath time.
I'll race you!
Okay!
Do you know what gobe means?
Gobe means mushrooms.
Thank you.
For earlier, too.
No worries.
Where did you hear the word gobe?
My brother wrote it in his sleep.
You don't really believe
in all this ghost stuff, do you?
No, but...
it is kind of strange.
How's your nose?
It'll be fine.
Oh, man.
Hey.
Hello.
For your nose. I always use it.
Thanks.
Do... you want to come in?
Yes, sure.
It doesn't look that spooky.
Well, you should see it at night.
Is that an invitation?
- Sorry?
- Is that an invitation?
No.
That's not what I meant.
This is...
my room.
Is this your girlfriend?
No, just a girl
from my friend group.
I never see her anymore.
Cool photos on Insta.
- Thanks.
- Hashtag "out in the sticks."
Uhh...
I'm sorry about that.
It's just different.
Howdy.
- Huh?
- Isn't that what you say?
No, not really.
Oh! It's so spooky in here.
- Yay, Ida's in too!
- In what?
Hello? We have a murder case to solve.
No, don't.
No ghost last night?
Shh.
No.
- Maybe the message has been delivered.
- Mushrooms?
Your brother could've heard
the word gobe somewhere.
No, the dead kids
want to tell us something.
But... we already know how they died
Maybe gobe
is an abbreviation for something.
Yup, for "ghosts don't exist".
Yes, that's it.
G, D, E...
Huh? That doesn't work.
No, no!
If it's really a message
from the other side,
why don't the kids tell us
who killed them?
Who says they know?
I mean, assuming ghosts existed.
There's only one way to find out.
A séance.
Ah! A Polaroid.
If you touch it,
Hendrik will cut your fingers off.
Why?
It was...
It was our dad's.
We need a camera to get evidence.
Yeah, whatever. Just be careful.
Now everyone hold hands.
Close your eyes.
The medium must go
into a light trance state
so that the spirit
can take over control of his body.
And then the lights start to flicker,
and Eddi floats in the air.
Don't be silly! This isn't a poltergeist.
It's a perfectly ordinary case
of possession.
Ah, okay then.
Can I continue now?
Good.
Close your eyes.
Spirits, if you are here,
we invite you to speak to us.
Far-out!
What did he say?
"Eddi is asleep."
Who are you?
Roland Polzmann.
Who killed you?
Gobe.
Sorry, dust allergy.
A-ha.
Be careful, guys.
Watch out!
- What?
- I heard a noise.
Fritz!
Ralf and...
Roland?
These must be the beds where they died.
Shut up.
Gobe.
Eddi.
Roland.
What do you mean?
Gobe.
Gobe.
Uh-oh.
Ralf is coming! Get out! Quick!
Come on!
- The Polaroids!
- Forget it, we've got to get out!
It's okay.
Mushrooms?
Why did Roland want us to find this?
Eddi's watching TV now.
And?
"Mushrooms in cream sauce,
mushrooms with game..." Pick one.
A film reel.
Super 8.
I have a projector for that at home.
Why am I not surprised?
Be right back.
I'll be quick.
There's something else.
Looks like a diary.
Hmm.
That was quick.
It wasn't locked.
You're lucky it's only me.
- Is your mom home?
- No, she's not here right now.
I see.
When will she be back?
Later.
Well, I'll wait inside until she's...
I'm doing homework.
Don't you have holidays?
Language course. I...
have to learn Austrian.
Hiya.
Are we on first-name terms now?
Sorry.
Look at this.
I have a dead certain solution
for the snails.
It's my mom's recipe.
Thanks.
Give my best to your mom.
- Hello, Mr. Röckl.
- Hey, Fritz.
Exciting! What are you guys up to?
- What are you up to?
- Thanks for the poison.
You're welcome. Hey.
We're friends, right?
Bye.
Ciao.
Bye.
You do realize
that he's into your mom, right?
Into her?
He likes your mom.
"June 11th, 1979."
"We've finally moved into our new house."
"The kids in the village
aren't very friendly and stare at me."
"July 5th, 1979."
"Roland has already made friends."
"My mother has gone
to pick mushrooms a bunch of times."
"She doesn't seem to like it here
in the village. I know how she feels."
Is that...
Seelos.
Yes, right?
- What else does it say?
- Um...
"March 3rd, 1980."
"Our housekeeper gives us little gifts."
"She's also trying to butter up my mom
by showing an interest in the garden."
"August 2nd, 1980."
"The housekeeper works hard."
"My dad gave her a necklace
to say thanks."
"He hasn't given my mother anything
in a long time."
That's it.
That's it? It can't be.
That was a lot.
Polzmann had an affair with Ms. Seelos.
- Where does it say that?
- The snail pendant.
He never gave anything to his wife,
but he did to Ms. Seelos.
But a snail pendant?
How unromantic is that?
Yeah, but... Polz comes from polž,
and polž is Slovenian and means "snail."
- So Polzmann means...
- Snail man.
- Yeah.
- You guys have such a wild imagination.
If that's true,
then Seelos should still
have the snail pendant, right?
But how are you going to find out?
- I'll ask her.
- I'm back!
This isn't what I meant
by look after him. Hello, Eddi.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello!
- Ida and Fritz.
Great.
We were just leaving.
- Will you be back for dinner?
- Of course.
Bye.
Bye.
So, what's your plan?
"Hello, Ms. Seelos.
Did you have an affair with Mr. Polzmann?"
"Did he give you a snail pendant?"
And what else?
Oh, yeah. "Did you kill Ralf and Roland?"
Mm-hm. Yeah, something like that.
Nobody home?
What now?
We'll look for the pendant.
- I'll keep watch.
- And we have to go inside?
Mm-hm.
Teamwork.
Why am I even doing this?
Uh-oh.
Hello, Ms. Seelos.
Hello.
Hello, Ms. Seelos!
Fuck!
Quick!
Come on! She's almost here. She's...
Out, quick. Hurry up.
Ms. Seelos?
Is it true that you were
the Polzmanns' housekeeper?
- Be glad I don't report you to the police!
- We're very sorry.
Did you poison Ralf and Roland?
- Fritz!
- Now you listen to me.
I used to clean at the Polzmanns.
But then the wife went crazy,
and I never went back.
I wasn't working for them...
when the two boys died.
And now, get out!
Or I'll tell your parents
what you've done.
But...
- But if...
- We're very sorry, Ms. Seelos.
Ms. Seelos, are you all right?
Get out!
She's obviously hiding something.
Definitely.
She's holding something back.
- Enough.
- Why didn't she call our parents?
We're in a village.
We handle things ourselves.
That worked great for the Polzmanns.
What are you going to do now?
What am I going to do?
I thought we're in this together.
- I'd like to get out of this dump.
- What's stopping you?
Definitely not you.
Anything else?
- Great. You scared off your girlfriend.
- What's that supposed to mean?
Even a blind person can see
that you like her.
Shut up! What do you know about girls?
More than you think.
Hey!
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
They're nice, your new friends.
Dinner will be ready in half an hour.
Ralfi.
- Morning, big guy.
- Don't!
- Hey, are you nuts?
- It's snail poison.
Hendrik, I got rid of that long ago.
What's up with you?
I have to go. Can you clean this up?
What are you looking at?
Hey.
- I wanted to say, about the other day...
- I'm busy.
I was all worked up, and...
I said things that I didn't mean.
I...
I'm sorry.
I have an idea.
Where is your dad?
Dead.
It was an accident.
I'm so sorry.
It was a while ago.
Is that why you want to believe in ghosts?
No.
- You saw for yourself.
- I don't know what I saw.
Are you coming on the weekend?
- Where?
- To the costume festival.
- Everyone will be there.
- Do you have to wear lederhosen?
- Yes, of course.
- No.
Too bad.
Guess I'll have to dance with Chris then.
You can't be serious.
I am.
What's wrong?
You saw him too.
I don't see anything.
But I saw it.
Yeah, me too.
Interesting.
So Eddi is the medium for Roland
and Hendrik for Ralf.
Eddi's asleep. I'm off.
I have my phone on me
in case anything comes up.
Yeah.
- Food's in the fridge if you're hungry.
- Thanks.
Do you need anything else?
- Thanks.
- We're fine. Have fun.
Okay then.
- Bye.
- Bye.
And now?
We wait until Hendrik's asleep
and Ralf comes.
Potato chips?
Fritz. I can't sleep with that noise.
Fritz!
Fine.
Hendrik?
Hendrik.
I'm awake.
Faster!
I have a plan.
Distract him.
Hendrik, please.
Please.
Ida, come here!
It's working.
What?
Salt protects you against ghosts.
And you know
how much salt there is in chips.
Ralf?
What do you want?
He wants revenge.
Murder.
Mother.
Hendrik?
Be careful.
Don't do anything you might regret later.
What happened?
Shit.
What's going on here?
Have you been drinking alcohol?
What? No.
You have no idea what...
what alcohol does to your body.
Yeah, you're still growing.
- What?
- Mom, you should go to bed.
- Yeah.
- Come on.
I... I should go to bed.
How do they...
How do they manage,
with all this Schnapps around here?
My mother always drinks a bottle of water
and takes two aspirins afterwards.
You're Fritz.
- Mm. Mom.
- Yeah.
Bed. Now.
- Come on.
- Now. Bed, Mom.
Oh, and remember, no schnapps.
- Did I hurt either of you?
- No.
You spoke Slovenian.
What did I say?
"I want revenge.
- Murder. Mother."
- It's obvious that Ralf wants revenge.
- But on who?
- On everyone. The whole village.
He wrote in his diary
about how much he hated it here.
Well, Roland said
that his mom was innocent, right?
Mm.
That means that she was also murdered.
Ralf wants revenge on the murderer,
not the whole village.
That means Ralf will come back.
Yes. But don't worry, we won't desert you.
- Looks good, huh?
- Just like Peter the goatherd in Heidi.
Yes, a bit.
Take a look.
It's fine.
You have to see how handsome you look.
Over there.
That's it.
Hey, I look like a total dork.
Oh, come on. You're just a little pale.
I'm sure Ida will be happy.
Mom, I'll go on ahead.
Okay.
Everything okay, Mom?
I know I've been asking a lot of you.
But...
We had to move
to the countryside anyway.
I can't afford the city anymore.
And it's just two years, and then...
In two years, you can decide
where you want to go.
I know I don't always show it,
but I love you.
Mom, you don't have to apologize.
We'll be all right.
Go on. And no schnapps, okay?
Oh.
You'll see. There's a storm coming.
What nonsense.
How much shall we bet?
Let's bet ten euros.
Deal. I'm in for ten.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Would you like a drink?
- Sure.
Hey, Fritz.
I've got one ready for you here.
- Thanks.
- Sure thing.
- And I've got one for you too.
- Thanks.
I think the punch has gone bad.
Where is he?
Who?
- Hendrik.
- No idea. Call him.
I don't have my phone on me.
- Where are you?
- In the cemetery.
- In the cemetery?
- She's got a snail pendant.
What kind of snail attendant?
Snail pendant.
- Hendrik?
- I think I've found the murderer. Wait.
SENDING
FAILED TO SEND
I'm getting into the car.
What car?
Hendrik?
He said he's getting in some car
and he's found the murderer.
See? What did I tell you?
Good evening.
Hello.
We have to do something.
Ms. Seelos said she wasn't
the housekeeper anymore
when the two boys died.
What if there was a second housekeeper?
What's wrong? Wait!
You said you were no longer
the housekeeper when the children died.
I know what I said.
Was there another one after you?
- Call the police.
- And you?
I'm going to look for Hendrik.
Thanks.
May I ask you for a dance?
This one's my dance.
Stop.
We need a SWAT team. A Cobra unit.
Hendrik's been kidnapped.
Slow down, young man. What's going on?
We need a SWAT team.
A Cobra unit.
Hendrik's been kidnapped.
Tell me, have you been drinking alcohol?
No!
"I can't abandon my family.
But our child will want for nothing.
I'm sorry.
We can no longer see each other.
With love..."
Ralfi.
Wait.
I'll make some cocoa.
Mr. Röckl! Thank God you're here.
We have to call the police. That woman...
Gerold, Ralfi is back.
Go back inside, Mom. I'll handle this.
Mom?
Don't do anything stupid now, kid.
WHERE ARE YOU???
Ida!
- What have you been you doing?
- I was at Röckl's house.
His mom had an affair with Polzmann.
I have the love letters.
There's something
about a pregnancy in there.
That means...
Röckl is Polzmann's illegitimate son.
Yes.
Shit! Come on!
Wait!
Here you go, Sabine.
- Is everything okay?
- Hendrik should have been here by now.
He's not writing back.
But... If you knew
what I used to get up to at his age...
What's that, dear?
That's Slovenian.
Eddi doesn't know Slovenian.
"Hendrik is in danger."
Eddi, come on, get up.
Come on, we have to go. Hurry up.
Sabine, wait.
Chris, come. I need your help.
I'm coming.
But he's in danger. We've got to help him.
Fritz, do you know where Hendrik is?
At the Röckls' house.
I've been trying to tell them.
Okay, then let's go there now.
All right then, let's go.
Call the police!
Fuck!
- Are you okay?
- Shit, I lost my phone
Come on, we'll hide in the cave.
Hey, did you guys teach Eddi
some Slovenian?
No, that was Roland.
Roland who?
You know, one of the ghosts. The nice one.
Ida! Don't be stupid now.
NO ENTRY! DANGER OF COLLAPSE
- What are we going to do?
- Come out!
Shit.
Look out.
[rocks scatter[
Careful. Hold my hand.
Stop!
Come on, don't be stupid now.
Stop or I'll shoot!
Wait.
Oh, shit.
Come on.
Come on, kids. Don't be stupid.
Just give me the letters...
and we'll forget about the whole thing.
WARNING!
I think he's gone.
Hendrik!
Hendrik, please say something!
Hendrik?
Hendrik, are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.
- Wait, I'll get help.
Shit. Fuck.
Ida!
Are you okay?
Kids?
Are you okay?
I don't think so.
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
Mr. Röckl, help us!
I'm stuck!
Hey!
Hello?
Can you hear us?
Please!
What are we gonna do?
Mr. Röckl? Hello?
MOM
- The others will get us out.
- Nobody knows we're here.
But they're looking for us.
They'll find us.
Right?
Ida?
I'm really glad we moved here.
Because of you.
I'm glad too.
We'll get out of here, you fool.
Look, over there.
Ida, go.
Get help.
It's okay.

POLICE
This can't happen again.
Ms. Röckl?
He can't hurt those kids.
Do you know where my son is?
No.
The snail pendant!
Stop!
Get out of the car! Move!
Ida?
Cave!
Stay in the car.
I'm sorry.
Please make it.
Please.
During the miracle of Carinthia,
the kid was underwater for half an hour
with a body temperature
of 18.4 degrees Celsius.
Fritz!
Yes, I know. Shut up.
He said, "It was you."
- Roland?
- Mom!
Don't say anything.
But...
You're dead.
"You killed us."
I didn't mean for that to happen.
Mom.
The children...
- Please.
- The children,
they weren't supposed to be in the house.
You meant to poison Mrs. Polzmann,
not the children.
Yes.
I have not had a single happy day since.
"And so,
the poisoning case was reopened."
"The perpetrator confessed."
"Her motive was love for the father
of the deceased children."
"She didn't mean to poison the children,
just their mother."
"Amalia Polzmann is neither a murderer
nor a suicide victim."
Are you coming?
Bye, Nadja.
Don't be silly!
This isn't a poltergeist.
- It's an ordinary case of possession.
- Yeah, well, okay.
