Keep kissing.
Do you need anything?
Should I leave?

I'm leaving!
Ok. A toast

Get them a shot, please!
A toast!
To the brave man
who is getting married.
Cheers! Cheers!

I love you, guys.
You should have listened to me.
You can wear one of my dresses.
Hello!
-Come in!
-Nervous, huh?
I'm fine. Come in.
-Congratulations, nephew!
-Thank you.
-The airport is in total chaos.
-Really?
They wouldn't let us out.
Here's a present for you.
-You shouldn't have.
-Please.
-Hello!
-Hi.
-Thank you for inviting us.
-Thank you, for coming!
-Congratulations!
-Thanks.
-Have a drink, see you in a bit.
-See you in a bit.
-Congratulations.
-This is uncle Isaac.
-Your new uncle.
-You're really late.
You look pretty in red.
Thank you.
From Omar.
-Where is he?
-They just arrived.
-Have you called the judge?
-Yes. What's the hurry?
We should've postponed
the wedding.
No way!
Hey. Don't worry.
-What's going on?
-The judge hasn't arrived.
Let's just have it tomorrow!
Everyone sleeps over.
She'll be here. I promise.
Excuse me. Come with me.
-You need to see something.
-Excuse us.
It was green.
Stop worrying.
Relax.
-Hello.
-Ma'am.
Hurry up.
Take those drinks out.
Fix that.
The suit is too big for you.
You should've had it tailored.
He looks like a clown.
Don't exaggerate.
Envious bitch.
Son!
-What? Is it a fine suit?
-It is.
I'd rather get nothing
than a shitty gift.
Victor's here.
One minute.
Marta, come please.
Someone brought green paint.
Look for it.
Go welcome Victor.
I'll take care of it.
-Hello!
-How's the prettiest girl
-in the world?
-How are you?
-Fine.
-Welcome!
Congratulations!
-You made it!
-I wouldn't miss
-your daughter's wedding.
-Hi!
-How are you!
-Hi.
Congratulations!
Daniel, I got
the construction permit.
Stop. We agreed
not to talk about work.
Ximena, fill him in.
Exactly.
Let's go to the wedding.
-Daniel.
-What's up, Ximenita.
-It's finally settled.
-I can't believe it!
-Did they have a safe trip?
-Yes. Everything's fine.
-Anything you need...
-Thank you.
Victor!
Rebeca!
It's so good to see you.
Such a beautiful house!
I want one just like it.
-Daniel designed it.
-Really?
Cristina!
Oh, my God! Girls!
I didn't know
the wedding was adults only!
It's okay.
They'll be our guests of honor.
-Give me a kiss!
-Hi.
-Look at this beauty!
-Hi.
All three girls are so big!
You'll design it, right?
I'll supervise it.
Look at the young couple.
So beautiful.
-How are you?
-Gorgeous!
And here's the young
and promising architect.
Glad to see you.
I have a present for you.
-For the bride and groom.
-Thank you very much.
Would you mind introducing us?
Sure. Victor,
the groom's mother, Pilar.
Can't believe you are doing
business at my wedding!
No we aren't!
You'll like him better
when you see his gift.
One percent of the bribes
he has received from Dad?
Marianne!
There they are.
Hello.
Hi. Are you okay? What happened?
-Nothing. Let's have a drink.
-Yes, everything's fine.
Are you OK?
Come with me.
Don't let my sister see her
like that.
I'm sorry. I don't want
to bother you.
Go see what's happening.
-What's going on?
-Nothing.
-What is it?
-Nothing, love. Nothing.
Give me some.
-What happened?
-It happened a few blocks away.
We should leave.
Ok. Get the cars ready.
I'll get Victor.
We'll look for the best exit
route. The cars will be ready.
Thank you.
Let's go.
This one?
It will fit perfectly.
-Are you okay?
-Yes. Don't worry.
-They threw green paint at you!
-It's okay, Marianne.
Ma'am, could we talk?
Here, sweetheart.
You picked the red one!
Remember Rolando,
Elisa's husband?
Yes.
He wants to see you.
Elisa needs
an emergency surgery.
-He wants to see me now?
-Yes, he's at the entrance.
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hi, Rolando.
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.
What is it?
Elisa is very ill.
She needs an emergency surgery.
Everything was ready
but protesters raided
the public hospital today.
Many were wounded,
and all patients
were thrown out.
I have to take her
to a private clinic.
The thing is,
I have to pay upfront
and I don't own a credit card.
-How much do you need?
-The doctor won't charge,
but I must cover the expenses
for the hospital
and medical assistants.
Around 200,000 pesos.
That's a lot.
What kind of surgery is it?
A heart valve replacement.
Everything's ready
in the private clinic.
How long ago did you
work for us?
Eight years ago.
Weren't you going to open
a restaurant?
A small restaurant
with my family.
But it didn't work out.
How long did we work
for you, ma'am?
That's not the point, Rolando.
Try to understand
that this is bad timing.
-I promise to pay you back soon.
-Yes. I know.
-Wait here.
-Yes.
How did it go?
Hopefully she'll help me...
You should've worn a suit
and brought a wedding gift.
-Do you own land there?
-Yes. At the beach.
-At the beach?
-But...
Please excuse us.
Give me $10,000.
-10,000 pesos?
-I'll explain later.
Get ready. The boss is coming.
Are we leaving?
Get Cristina and the girls.
-I'll be discreet.
-Dismiss the planned route.
Daniel.
Son, give me $5,000.
Thank you.
I got you $35,000 from Ivan,
Daniel and myself.
That's all I can give you
right now.
It won't be enough.
Come back tomorrow. We can sort
something out
with Ivan's contacts.
I have no one else
to turn to, ma'am.
I need to go back to the party.
Good luck.
Who was a good girl?
I love your dress.
That flower is cute.
Congratulations, Marianne!
Rolando!
Hello! How are you?
Where's Elisa?
-She's in the hospital.
-Why?
She needs a new heart valve.
I came to ask your parents help.
-Did they help you?
-Your mother gave me some money,
but it's an expensive surgery.
I'll be right there.
Good to see you!
-How much you need?
-$200,000.
I just have $50,000.
-Wait here.
-Yes.
-Have you ever tried Peyote?
-Peyote and MDMA.
Mexico's best drug dealer,
right here.
Handsome, too.
-Daniel, do you remember Elisa?
-Of course!
She's sick and needs our help.
Talk to Dad.
You know how he is
about those things.
Mom gave him some money
but he needs like $150,000 more.
-Really? 150,000 pesos?
-Elisa is sick!
I'll talk to him.
-What hospital is she in?
-I don't know.
-She's in Naucalpan.
-Damn.
I heard things
are getting tougher there.
-MDMA.
-Thank you.
-I'm sorry to bother you.
-It's okay.
How have you been?
Fine, but worried
about Elisa's surgery.
When did we last see
each other?
Seven years ago.
And Elisa?
A little longer.
How much did my mother give you?
-$35,000.
-Enough, right?
The thing is
I need like $150,000.
How are you going to get it?
I have $50,000.
But that's not even half
of what I need.
One, two, three and a half...
You don't need to pay me back,
just leave my house.
If I could handle
it differently,
I wouldn't be here.
There's green paint
on your sleeve.
Leave or I'll have you
thrown out.
Alan is waiting for you.
Wait here.
Excuse me.
Did you reset
the safe's password?
-Your mother did.
-What is the new one?
Enjoy your wedding.
It's not your problem.
It's my money!
Does Alan know?
It's his money too.
I'm taking some of the money.
-I already told him.
-Do you know
the safe's password?
He says it might not be true.
Yes, it's true,
can we give it to him?
OK.
Enough, Marianne!
Forget it. It's your
wedding day. Enjoy.
You're a piece of shit!
I hate you!
You deal with her, man.
We'll do as you say.
Don't get mad.
Let's ask for
the safe's password.
Should we discuss it
with your father first?
Marianne!
Felipe!
-Have you seen Rolando?
-He already left, Miss.
-Did he?
-About 20 minutes ago.
Thanks.
What hospital is Elisa in?
She is at home
while they gather the money.
Is it far?
About 20 minutes away.
Depends
on the situation outside.
Follow me.
Felipe, open the door.
Your father is going to kill me.
We won't be long.
The judge is here!
I'm sorry! I was driving around.
Main streets are blocked.
-Good to see you.
-Nice to meet you.
-It's nice to see you.
-Likewise!
I have another wedding at six.
There is no problem.
How far along are you?
-Where's Marianne?
-I don't know!
The judge is here!
Here's the groom.
Marta, find Marianne.
The judge is here.
-Dry the wine glasses properly.
-Mhm.
Marianne?
-Felipe, have you seen Marianne?
-She left a while ago.
-Where?
-I don't know.
She left with Cristian.
-Who did you notify?
-Nobody asked.
-It's awful without a jacket...
-I have to serve bottles.
58 more lootings
than previous nights...
-specifically in homes...
-Hello?
-Hi, Mom.
-...and some establishments.
Yes. I'm with her.
-We're going to see Elisa.
-Let me talk to her.
...and some grocery stores.
I'll take Elisa to the hospital.
I brought my credit card.
No.
Then don't tell them.
The judge is already there?
Fuck. Police is everywhere.
The street is closed.
They can wait, Marta.
Okay? I won't be long.
Avoid going out of your home.
Marta, if nobody helps her...
Okay. Everything's fine.
We'll call you back.
-Hello, officer.
-Where are you coming from?
From Nubes Street.
We need to get to the freeway.
-The street is closed.
-Please, it's an emergency!
-Just leave.
-Then how do I
-get to the freeway?
-Just leave.
-Turn around.
-Where?
-Turn around.
-You were of great help!
-Dicks.
-Yeah! Amazing job.
Should we go back home?
No. No, no. Let's go.
I'm here in the freeway,
and it's collapsed
by the protesters.
There aren't soldiers
in the streets.
We don't understand
why there isn't
a response
by the authorities yet.
This situation is chaotic.
They are jumping
over the cars...
-We don't have to hurry.
-Great!
-Would you like a drink?
-A glass of cold water, please.
Hey! What are you doing?
What do you want?
Felipe!
I'll get him.
Hey, stop the music.
Felipe!
Get them off of there.
-Felipe!
-Felipe!
Sir!
Get them down
and throw them out!
Yes, sir!
Ivan...
Here they come.
Watch out!
-No...
-Hey. Hey.
Put your gun down.
Take all you want. Here.
But please...
put your gun down.
Felipe!
Shoot them!
Do something you idiot!
-Call an ambulance.
-Shoot them...
Go inside, people!
Move, ladies!
Move!
Hurry! Move on!
Where the fuck do you
think you're going?
-Go!
-Mom!
-You come with me.
-Let her go.
Try me, motherfucker!
Felipe!
Please, don't hurt her!
-Move it!
-Call an ambulance, damn it!
-Against the bookshelf!
-Please call an ambulance!
Hurry up!
Hands behind your back!
Against the bookshelf.
Hands behind your back!
Okay, but please
call an ambulance.
-He'll die.
-For fuck's sake!
Please, don't hurt me.
Wait.
Son...
Don't come back.
Listen! Don't come back here!
I'll explain later.
Go home.
I'll explain later!
-What the hell do you want?
-Get out of the way.
-Leave her alone!
-Come here! Hurry, take her!
Leave her alone!
Leave her alone!
-Ask her what's going on?
-Let me listen!
Mom?
Get down, blondie.
Get down, bitch!
Pull over. I'll drive.
Hurry up. Everything you have.
Felipe.
-And Marianne?
-What about her?
Where is she?
Don't worry. She's fine.
Look.
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth!
Your mother will join her soon.
Okay, stop. Sorry.
I don't know how
to wire from here.
Is there someone at your house?
Nobody. It's empty.
Please don't hurt her.
-Calm down.
-Let's go.
You stay here.
Hand me everything,
or I'll beat
the shit out of you.
Hurry up!
You people,
always walking all over us.
Fuck off!
Take your shoes off.
-Don't move.
-What are you staring at, idiot?
Give me everything
or I'll shoot you.
I'll hit you with this, stupid!
Take everything off. Hurry!
-Go, motherfuckers!
-Run!
Uncle!
Head upstairs.
Go straight.
Phone lines are dead.
Marianne...
Why did you bring her here?
She wanted to take
Elisa to the hospital.
I'll see if my phone works.
We'll take you to the hospital.
Everything will be fine.
Marianne.
Let's go to my place.
Have a seat.
Do you want some water?
Yes, please.
...many attacks
on local residents.
After many hours
of chaos and riots,
we have been
receiving reports...
Thank you.
...some protocols
have been successfully
put together in many parts
of the city.
We do not have an update
on the official numbers,
but it is estimated
that thousands
of people are affected.
FUCKING RICH PEOPLE.
Give us a call, OK?
Again, we don't have
updated information
on official numbers
due to saturation and collapse
of telephone lines
and communication networks.
-But we can confirm...
-I want to go home now.
...a number of clashes
with the authorities.
I'll take a look outside.
The army has announced a curfew
in those colonies
where they were the attacks.
What are you doing outside?
What are you doing there?
-I need to help someone!
-On your knees!
Get down!
Hands on the back of your head.
-Where is she?
-In the car.
Get out.
-Are you okay?
-I work in her house.
-Where do you live?
-In Pedregal.
-This is your car?
-Yes.
We'll take you home.
-Take her.
-Can I go with her?
Stay home.
Do you have service?
-I can't call home.
-Phones are dead.
Things got bad in Pedregal too?
Don't worry. We're almost there.
-What's your name?
-Marianne.
-Your last name?
-Novelo.
-Who was that guy?
-Cristian.
He works for my family.
Give me your phone.
Take off your earrings.
-Why?
-Give them to me!
Your ring and watch.
What else do you got?
That's all?
What are you staring at?
Keep your head down!
She said down.
This has to be finished today
60 MILLION PEOPLE
LIVING IN POVERTY
JUSTICE
Hurry up! Hurry up!
We have no time.
Clean up!
Move!
Let me help you.
-Where's Marianne?
-Some soldiers took her home.
Move it.
Women on one side,
men on the other.
Against the wall.
Move it!
Your head down.

Welcome to hell, assholes!

Take your shoes off.
I have no time.

Sit up straight.

Mr. Daniel Novelo?
I'm Nora Beltrán.
From the funeral home.
I need to start the formalities
for your wife
and mother's funerals.
You need to complete
and sign these forms.
Let me know
if you need anything.
I'll be in my office.
Thank you.
Honestly,
we don't know what's next.
We must be aware of
this new order as you said...
it is important that the society
I'll be right back.
...of this country adapts...
We are seeing images
of people breaking everything.
How to get through it?
Are we talking about
a new order?
Totally. The army is setting
a very strict curfew...
How can we help?
By trusting me.
-What can we do?
-Nothing. I'll handle this.
-We'll find her.
-Victor, what do I tell Dad?
Just that I'll come
by the hospital tonight.
-Shall we display some ads?
-No way. Let us do our job.
-It could be dangerous.
-We need to leave.
-This is General Oribe.
-General.
-Don't worry. We'll find her.
-Thank you.
-Thanks.
-Be patient.
Get up, assholes!
Wake up.
Get up! Let's go!
-Hurry!
-Get up now!
-Get off of her!
-Don't touch her!
Hey, dolly!
Let her go! Let her go!
Come on, mamacita.
Easy, easy. Relax.
Kiss me.
You're going to enjoy it.
Trust me.
Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!
Open your fucking mouth!
How then can man
be justified with God?
How can he who is born
of woman be pure?
Dominion and fear are with God.
He makes peace
in his high heaven.
Is there any number
to his armies...
This is an official
announcement.
Starting now, transit
is allowed for two hours.
Starting now, transit
is allowed for two hours.
-Put your jacket on.
-Yes.
I'm going to the hospital.
-Look after her.
-Good luck.
There are many concerns
about job permits.
Today we'll be joined by
the Head
of the Labor Department...
Your attention, please.
This is an official
announcement.
Water service will remain
operating as usual.
Remain calm,
and await further instructions.
I need to get to the hospital.
No, you can't.
Streets are closed.
-Who can I speak with?
-Nobody. Please leave.
-Please let me through.
-Please leave.
-Who can I speak with?
-Go away.
Handle that flowerpot
very carefully.
Does anyone have a lighter?
It's here, on your left.
Is he okay?
Come in.
We're trying to find her.
Thank you.
It's going to be fine, Dad.
Victor?
Thanks.
Thanks for helping us.
It's been almost a month.
What if they never find her?
What do you mean?
How much longer
will we wait for news?
I don't know, Mom.
I'll be home.
-Beatriz.
-Yes?
Give me a hand.
But I'm checking on Mr. Novelo.
He is busy now. So...
Get a cleaning rag.
Come on.
Transfer everything we have
to them. Everything.
Transfer everything.
Soldier! Next!
Pull yourself together
and then come back.
Sixteen!
Go ahead, blondie.
Speak up!
Speak up! Damn it!
Look you goddamn girl!
Are you talking or not?
Should I bring one
of your damn family members?
Go ahead.
Mom. Dad.
I'm fine.
But give them what they want.
I want to go home.
I hope you're okay.
I love you very much.
Do as they say, okay?
Done.
-I'll get a doctor.
-Wait till after curfew.
No. She's in terrible pain.
I'll check on Elisa.
Should I bring your sweater?
What are you doing here?
I need to go to the hospital!
You can't leave your house, sir!
Go back home!
-My wife is very ill!
-Stop right there.
-She's dying!
-Stop!
My wife is...
We don't want more death.
We don't want more sorrow.
God, help us find hope
in these troubled times.
We are honest,
humble and hardworking children.
Stand up to honor
the young orphans:
Eligio Guevara,
Joaquin Guevara...
and Sacramento Robles.
My dear friends:
Rolando Martinez
and his wife, Elisa.
Faithful believers in the Lord.
Hello?
Marianne?
Marianne!
-Where are you? Are you okay?
-I love you.
-Marianne!
-Do as they say.
You've herd
your daughter, so of bitch.
We want ten million,
and don't call the police.
-No.
-Wait for payment instructions.
-I'll get the money.
-Wait for instructions.
Let me talk to...
Marianne?
-Yes
-Did you hear her?
Yes.
When is it number 16's turn?
Be patient.
How much is our share?
Between $100,000 and $200,000.
That's not enough.
That's what we agreed.
How much are you asking for?
When will that be?
The more patient we are,
the more money we'll get!
Door!
Look down!
Eat this.
I'll help you out. Trust me.
Many citizens are
unsettled about the curfew
since it has been extended
in numerous states...
...such as Coahuila,
where the governor has declared
that residents are not allowed
to be outside,
from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m...
We have a message
for you. Open the door.
I'll see what they want.
We kidnapped Marianne.
Get us 800,000 pesos
if you want to see her alive.
You were supposed
to take her home.
Were we?
Where do we get the money?
You work
for her family. Ask them.
We still can't go to work.
You already can
apply for a job permit.
They are available now.
Understood?
Please, keep calm!
We need order so we can
provide you with water!
All families will get water.
We need order.
One proper line!
One proper line!
Everyone will get water.
Line up! Line up!
You have 90 minutes
before curfew begins.
Then you must return
to your home.
Otherwise you will
be sanctioned.
What do you need?
I need to go to the job office.
The street is closed.
-Where can I get a permit?
-I can't help you. Go back.
All the citizens
have 90 minutes
before curfew begins.
No!
Next!
Move it, asshole!
Come on, asshole.
Come on, bitch.
Why weren't we informed
since the first call?
They said they would kill her.
Has anyone else
seen this video?
Just us.
-Anyone else?
-My mother.
-Did they demand money by email?
-No. Just by video.
What if we missed that mail?
Don't worry. We'll track her
with the information we have.
Let me know if they
contact you again.
Sure.
Bags and backpacks open!
Keep walking!
Open wide!
Keep going, ma'am!

Will you help me clean?
Yes, ma'am.
You go and see Daniel.
He's upstairs.
Excuse me.
-Hello.
-Yes?
Is Daniel here?
-Daniel.
-Yes?
Someone is here for you.
How are you?
We need to talk.
Some people want to negotiate
Marianne's return.
Who?
Two soldiers that took her
from my house.
What was she doing there?
Beatriz, can you excuse us?
Sure.
Someone is asking Cristian
for Marianne's ransom.
What does he have
to do with this?
The day of the wedding,
he drove her to Elisa's place.
And...
The next day, soldiers took her
from there.
They're asking $800,000.
Give it to him.
Should we call Victor?
No.
Are we going to give
them the money?
-Stay out of it.
-She's my wife.
Let's see.
How are you going to carry it?
Boss, this
operation has been a success.
How much did you keep
for yourself?
Come on, boss.
Count it, Jimenez.
You have any beer?
-Soldier, deliver the package.
-Yes, Commander.
Number three!
Number three!
Your ransom was paid.
You are free to go.
Come on.
Let's go.
Open your bag!
All bags open!
Whatever you're carrying.
Take out that rag.
Go ahead!
Keep walking, ma'am!

Good evening, Lucy.
Get inside.
Is it all there?
Where's Marianne?
This is just a down payment.
We will come
get one more million.
That wasn't the deal.
Do you want her dead or alive?
We want one million by tomorrow.
Where's Marianne?
She wasn't released.
They are asking
one more million.
Ximena, is Victor there?
Yes, I'll hold.
Cristian and Marta
kidnapped Marianne.
Yes, I'm sure.
They are in my house
demanding one million.
In their house I think.
Yes, it's them.
Daniel...
-No, Dad doesn't know.
-Daniel...
Hurry, bring a plastic bag.
How's business going?
Answer me!
Uncover your faces.
Turn around!
Hands on the back of your heads!
Fingers interlocked.

Stand up.

I'm sorry for your loss.
Follow me.
