Okay. I can't get that, that...
Okay, guys. Ready?
- We wish you a Merry Christmas.
- It's just the...
bike I wanted.
Yeah, do you like it?
Is that the one?
Good. Merry Christmas.
Oh, the new hockey stick.
Is it a good size?
Yeah, it looks fine to me.
Let me see that slapshot.
Hey, don't knock anything off the table.
I am the greatest.
I am the greatest.
Show me what you got. Oh.
Hang on one sec.
Ready?
All right, flip it up.
You okay?
You okay?
Okay, you're on your own.
Oh, my gosh. Luke.
Oh, honey.
Watch out for the tree though.
Do a trick.
Do a trick.
How proud are you of him?
Oh, my God. He's amazing.
Did mommy do that?
Tell me the truth.
Did mommy do that painting for you?
Hey. Wow. Look at that.
Just got one question.
What the heck is it?
It is abstract.
So when I get signed,
I'll buy you a new house, okay?
Hey, what's wrong with this house?
Ready?
Oh, shit.
Okay, make a wish.
So how old are you, mom?
- How old am I?
- We were just wondering.
You look gorgeous.
You don't look a day over...
Just spit it out, dad.
Brendan Hume, you've just won MVP.
...our golden boy.
Number one...
Get this baby lit.
Can I slap him when we wake him up?
No...
Please?
He's going to kill us.
Surprise!
- Surprise!
- Happy Birthday, Lukey!
- Happy Birthday, Lukey!
- Happy Birthday.
Fourteen,
it feels no different that yesterday
when I was thirteen.
Do you want your
fourteen punches now or...?
A little later, after I wake up.
Get off me.
Ah man. I almost had you.
Should old acquaintance be forgot.
And never brought to mind.
Should old acquaintance be forgot.
And days of auld lang syne.
Can I bother you?
Just you think there's no order anywhere,
there's order looking right at you.
Okay.
What do you need here?
Annie just said I need you to approve this.
This guy worked here
at Starfish for six years...
but his wife's dead, no kids, no will.
I just want to roll his pension
back up into the fund,
make it easy.
Come on, don't make file with the state.
We file with the state so that one day...
if someone looks back at this guy's death,
he will see that we did our job.
You're right.
You've got to cover our asses.
I got it, sorry.
No... we do our job,
and we do right by a guy who worked for us.
Lest he died in vain.
What's that 'order in the universe' thing?
Well, you know, our insurer spent
three hundred thousand bucks...
on this new model, new field data,
new society.
Who is the ideal employee?
Who dies how and when?
And they sent it over to show
what a great job they're doing.
And you know what it says?
It says that people with kids live longer
than people with no kids...
people with two live longer
than people with one...
smoking is bad...
speeding is bad...
deaths in a family are bad...
divorce is bad.
It's kind of nice...
to see that all that junk is still true.
You know?
Hey, you're the one with perfect kids.
Brendan, you're such a kiss-ass.
God gave me the skills.
- I can't help it.
- Oh. God. Mom.
I need to go kill myself.
Of course you do, Lukey.
May I be excused?
No.
I've got a cretin for a brother.
I've a no-dick for a brother.
Okay, you stop. Right now.
You should know better.
What?
Let's be a family, should we?
Can I say no?
No.
I demand emancipation. I want a lawyer.
Okay, I am filing right...
- I'm home.
- Now.
Sorry I'm late. Did I miss dinner?
No, there's plenty.
I'll heat something up for you.
Hey, dad,
I need a ride to the city on Saturday.
The city?
Yeah, it's an exchange game.
I'm the first line again.
No kidding.
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah.
Waldren must love you.
Yeah, because he's a kiss-ass.
Well, good for him. We all going?
No, Lukey's got soccer.
Yeah, but I'm not starting
so you can just go on...
- Maybe you should just kiss some...
more ass, or just not suck so bad.
Dad, he was just kidding.
Okay, he was just being an idiot.
Don't call him an idiot.
Lucas, you have a loyal and loving brother.
I agree.
A loyal and loving kiss-ass.
Look, should we just all please
be civilized for once
before I kill somebody?
Whatever, weasel.
Duh, whatever, weasel.
Luke.
Plate.
Come here, little punk.
Get off me.
See what you miss
when you don't come home.
Yeah, well, at least
they're not throwing food.
Play a heck of a game, kid.
I'm proud of you.
Heck of a game.
Thank you...
Love the way you're handling the puck.
It's great.
So some of the guys have been talking about
maybe going to college in Canada.
Canada, huh?
Canada is far.
You'll still have Lukey.
Now there's a comfort.
Oh, no, come on, I'm kidding.
You get to kid about your kids
or you lose your mind.
You'll see.
Look, you had a great game.
You've had several great games...
but professional hockey, is that
what we're talking about here, Bren?
I mean maybe, I don't know.
That's a risky business.
And this is coming from your
extensive professional sports background
- or...
- No, my extensive...
risk assessment background,
thank you very much.
Risk, liabilities, the stuff of life, son.
No, it's the stuff of your life, dad,
your thrilling life.
Hey, don't make fun of your father,
you bum.
I'm the only one you get.
I guess we can talk to Coach Waldren...
and you can research schools in Canada...
and find somebody who
could educate us on hockey
- versus law school.
- Dad...
What?
Educate us?
Look, I just want to play some hockey.
Hey, lights.
Dad, so what do you say?
I said we could look into it,
- all right? - Okay.
Please don't tell your mother.
I would never.
Where the heck is the darn expressway?
Oh, great.
Hey, where do you think you're going?
I need my fluids, dad.
Oh, yeah, the obligatory Slushee stop.
They have them in there, right?
That, or something worse for you.
- Do you have money?
- Yeah.
Okay, quick in and out,
because we got to get home.
All right.
Hey, honey, it's me.
I just wanted to let you know...
that our son is going to
Canada to play hockey...
and we didn't want any kind of
long drawn-out goodbye,
so I dropped him off at the airport.
He says he'll call,
but of course we may
never see our son again.
But as long as he's happy, right?
Okay.
I love you.
And we'll be home soon. Bye.
Watch your ass, bitch.
Back up off me, all right. Whatever, man.
Get the fuck down
or I will blow your fucking head off.
Get the fuck down.
Hey, yo, this is your man.
This is your man.
- He's going for his gat, dog.
- Come on, Billy.
Get this fucker.
That's your guy.
Do this or you're not one of us. Do it.
Hey, you can do this.
Joey.
Kill that motherfucker, Joey.
That's my boy.
Let's go. Let's go.
Give me the gun. Let's go.
- What about Joey.
- Get the fuck in the car.
What the fuck!
Goddamn it.
Fuck you.
Motherfucker.
Brendan.
Brendan.
Oh, God.
Help.
Help me.
Somebody help me.
Help.
Where's Joe?
He's a man now.
He can take the subway.
Can you get some help?
Can somebody help us, please? Please.
Doctor.
I need a gurney.
He was cut. Somebody cut him in...
Get an airway open. Create an airway.
He's my son.
- That's my son.
- Maggie.
- Okay, get him.
- Brendan,
we're in the hospital now, okay?
They're going to take care of you now.
Get your fixed up.
Sir, I'm sorry.
You need to stay back here.
- What?
- No, the doctors need to do their job, sir.
- I know,
but I can't go in there?
Sorry.
Okay, he'll be okay, right?
It's my son.
His name's Brendan.
Five
It's number five.
That's Joe Darley.
He's...
a kid.
He's a runt. Almost twenty-three.
And he's an animal.
Supposed to have some kind of a...
pre-trial, a hearing, tomorrow...
and they want me to go make a statement.
You want to go with me?
You go.
Put that animal in jail.
That's what the cops called him.
Animal.
You're going to take that off?
The school said
they wanted to do a memorial
at the next game.
The team wanted to do something.
That's nice of them.
He would have been playing.
Till my body is dust.
Till my soul is no more.
I will love you.
Love you.
Till the sun starts to cry.
And the moon turns to rust.
I will love you...
love you.
But I need to know...
Will you stay for all time forever...
and a day?
Then I'll give my heart...
till the end of our time...
forever and a day.
Today's easy.
I need you to sit there,
put the fear of God in this guy.
If the judge asks you,
you tell him what you told us,
and identify Darley in court.
Okay?
The minute I get your statement in,
with you sitting right there...
the public defender's going to
wet his pants and fold.
I'll make a deal in five minutes.
Get this guy in jail today, easy-peasy.
Deal? Wait.
Hang on, what do you mean?
What deal?
I want this guy to go away
for the rest of his life.
No.
I can get you 3 to 5, guaranteed.
That's a very decent result.
I'm talking guaranteed time,
not maybe, not the jury
didn't feel up to it.
That's worth more than chasing some
make-believe 10 to life
and the guy walks free.
You want that?
He killed my son.
Mr. Hume. I've got one eyewitness. You.
That's nice.
But do you know how many cases
with one eyewitness
I don't even bother to try for a deal on?
The machete magically disappeared.
The only blood we could
find on that weasel was his own
from when the car clipped him.
And you picked
the only gas station in America
without a working surveillance camera.
We've just got your word.
That's not bad,
if I can scare the guy into a deal.
You're using my son's death
like some kind of card trick.
Look, I get a banger off the street
a year or so,
somebody does my job for me...
he doesn't get out of there alive.
Fine with me.
He finds Jesus. Fine with me.
But we get religion and go to trail,
as much as I'd love to...
and the defense starts working on.
"When was your last eye exam?"
"What do you have
against inner city youth?"
And how unfair it is for them
to grow up so violent...
how they're forced into initiation killings
or face execution themselves.
You want a jury feeling sorry
for this fucker? Huh?
You want him to walk?
Wait, you said...
initiation killing.
I thought this was a robbery.
It only looked like one.
It was an initiation.
You kill someone at random
to get made in a gang.
It's the price of admission.
Are you saying that Brendan was killed...
so that some asshole
could feel more like a man?
So that he could be in some club?
This is a 'take it or leave it' thing,
sorry to say.
Your Honor, I'd like to enter
the statement of a witness...
present at the time of the attack,
father of the victim.
We can enter that at trial,
can we not, Mr. Behring?
I believe, your honor,
if we enter it today...
defense will change their plea to guilty.
Save the people the time
and expense of a trial.
That's the statement?
Mr. Hume?
Mr. Hume?
You're giving evidence that
Mr. Darley here, before your eyes...
attacked your son and caused his death?
You're saying you will testify to that
in a trial?
No, your honor, I am not.
What?
It was dark.
There were a lot of them.
I can't be sure anymore.
Mr. Behring...
do you expect to obtain evidence
other than Mr. Hume's here?
No, your honor, I do not.
I'm dismissing this case.
Mr. Darley, you're released from custody.
You may return with a bailiff
to the holding cells...
to retrieve your personal effects.
Joe.
You beat that shit. You beat that.
You the man.
That's it.
Come on, let's go.
You beat that rap pretty fucking good,
huh? I'm proud of you.
Who's a man now?
I know.
Get in the car.
Have a nice fun time
with this one here, weasel.
- Okay. - All right?
I'm proud of you.
All right?
Dad?
Dad?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Hey, what are you doing?
Don't play with that. Put it down.
So it was...
like a...
gas station.
Where Bren got killed?
Yeah, it was a gas station.
Why do you want to know?
I just...
you know, I wondered where he died.
Yeah.
It was...
a Stop-Spot in Rockside.
Do you...
Do you think he was scared?
Yeah, Luke, I do.
I think he was scared.
How did it go?
They let him go.
They did what? Why?
I don't think it was him.
Well, but you said it was him.
You said they had him.
Are they going to keep looking?
Yeah, they said they would.
Oh, Jesus.
I'm sorry. What do you want me to do?
I'm sorry.
I left something at the office.
I'd better go back.
Now?
- Nick.
- I'll be home as soon as I can.
Oh, God, what am I doing?
Fucking piece of shit.
Fuck.
Jesus.
Fuck man. You fucking scared the shi...
Hey, wait a minute.
You fucking kidding me?
You?
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, you know mom's perfect.
Oh, well, that's for sure.
Nah, I got nothing.
I want to be just like you, dad.
Oh, that's what I like to hear.
I've been meaning to do this for months.
It's very grown-up of you to help.
Hi, guys.
Hey.
What happened?
I slipped in the driveway.
Honey. Oh, my God. Look at you.
You're a mess.
It's okay, I cut my head. That's all.
Are you all right?
Fine, yeah. That's okay.
No, it's not okay.
I'm going to take a shower.
Okay, I'm going to get bandages.
I'll bring them up.
How you doing, kid?
You okay?
I'm okay.
I guess.
Good.
That's good.
I'm going to take a shower.
Brendan Hume, you've just won MVP.
What do you have to say for yourself?
Can I take this already? Can I take this?
Number one...
Brendan Hume, our golden boy.
Oh, honey.
Oh, God.
- Oh, God.
- Baby. It's okay.
I'm so sorry.
- Oh, God.
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
Yo, Billy.
Watch the fucking pieces.
For Chris' sake, they're worth something,
unlike you.
Where you been, Nancy?
What the fuck you call that?
That's our night.
When I take pity on you
and your faggot half-wit friends...
give you a couple of corners to run...
you better deliver for me...
or I'll know you been dealing,
and I'll kill you.
You could be the prince of Pan-Yan...
if you fucking light-bag me,
I'll fucking kill you.
Lord knows I've been patient.
Yes.
You can get the fuck out of my sight now.
Fucking half-wit.
What?
What?
Somebody fucking tell me
what the fuck is going on.
You hear?
Joe, dude.
Somebody stuck him.
He's dead.
What?
You're lying.
Man he's gone.
Hey.
How you guys faring?
You getting through?
Yeah, we're okay.
You find compensations.
That's what we do, right?
We compensate for our losses.
Move on.
If anything like that
ever happened to me, I'd just...
I don't know, I think I'd snap.
Well, you really don't know
what you'd do until it happens.
Surprise yourself.
Excuse me, Nick.
Detective Wallis is here to see you.
Yeah, come on in.
Hi, I'm sorry to break in on your day.
No, it's fine.
The guy we thought killed your son?
Somebody killed him.
Well, what was that?
Some kind of a gang thing or...?
We think so.
Man, I guess there is justice, huh?
Yeah, I suppose there is.
I thought you'd like to know.
If he was the guy, I mean.
Yes, well, thanks for letting me know.
All right, I'll leave you to it then.
I guess I don't need to say anything,
Nick...
but you know the company would pay
for counseling if you guys want it.
We'll manage.
Thanks, Owen.
Okay.
He didn't deserve that.
No way he deserved that.
He was a true fucking soldier.
To Joe.
He was a good fucking boy.
A good fucking boy.
So that's what we're going to do?
Why don't you show
a little fucking respect at least?
See, that's why you guys are nothing.
That's why you're bunch of fucking punks...
because you would rather drink up
and toke yourself fucking witless.
Witless and scared shitless.
My bad.
Let's... here, cheers.
Get your fucking glasses up.
All of you.
Joe just wasn't made for this shit.
That's all.
He wasn't like us.
No, wasn't like you, you mean.
He was not like you.
He was better than you.
We as good as brothers
since we was kids,
and you fucking go this way?
What. I am not as good as you now?
Joe was like blood to me, dog.
As good as fucking blood. You, too.
Well.
I would like to catch the motherfucker
that did this.
Oh, we will.
Ain't no motherfucking doubt.
Do the right fucking thing for Joe, yeah?
So who fucking did it?
It wasn't the Cutty Macks, man.
I would know about it.
Unless you were high.
I'm not high.
Well, it wasn't B-street, Billy.
Wasn't the Hall.
Wasn't any of those assholes.
Yo, my sister said she saw some fucker
in a suit down there.
Just chilling.
How many 'fuckers in a suit'
you ever see at Stokely fucking Hall?
See, here's a comical thing.
When one of us gets killed,
we don't make the paper.
But the son of a senior VP
of Starfish Capital...
Go talk to your sister.
Hey, Amy, what's up?
I'm going home.
You okay? You need anything?
No, I'm fine.
I'm just going to finish
this risk analysis and then...
Actually,
could you drop this off with Owen, please
on your way out?
- Sure.
- Thank you. Good night.
Wait, dude.
Get his ass. Come on.
Come on.
Get him...
Where's he at?
Go...
Go...
Go...
Go...
Come on.
Hey, which way is 1801?
1801 Main, which way?
Through the boiler room, there.
Where the fuck did he go?
Heco, Dog, Spink, go cut him off.
Kill him.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Where is he at?
Oh, God. Okay.
Oh, shit.
Did you talk to Sally?
Yeah.
Move your ass, let's go.
Tommy, go.
Jamie, get your Willie Nelson ass up there.
You ain't going to make
a fool out of me, motherfucker.
Fuck.
Billy, we got to go, man.
Billy, we got to get the fuck out of here.
Come on.
Go. Come on.
Oh, fuck. Oh, Jesus.
Hi honey, I'm sorry I'm late.
What?
Wait, what do you mean?
You can't find him?
Where the hell is he?
Well, did you call his friends?
Oh, Jesus. Honey.
Look, I got to call you back.
I think I know where he is.
All right.
Get whatever prints you
can from this stuff. Let me know.
Look, I need you to start a canvas,
all right?
Pull people from the street if you have to.
Someone had to see something.
Luke.
Luke, what the hell are you doing?
Your mother's worried sick.
Now get in the car.
No.
I said, get in the car.
No, I don't want to get in the car.
I said get in the car.
Fuck you.
Lucas.
This is not a safe place.
Yeah, I know that much, don't I?
Would it have been better if it was me?
Is that what it is?
You guys could
have handled that a lot easier
than losing Bren the golden boy.
Luke...
Please get in the car.
Come on.
Luke, get in that goddamn car right now.
Right now.
Oh, God.
Oh, baby. Honey.
I'm sorry.
Don't ever do that again, okay?
Yo, we're going to do this?
You need to sign in.
Sir, you need to sign in.
Messengers drop-off over there.
No, I need to hand deliver this,
to Nicholas Hume.
You can sign in and
drop it off like everyone else.
Call upstairs.
Shit.
Nicholas Hume.
Move.
Nicholas Hume.
Nicholas Hume.
Nice office, motherfucker.
What the hell do you want?
That's the gift of freedom, baby.
Sir, should we escort this person out?
Sir?
Free from wondering
how you're going to die now.
You're free from wondering
if you're going to die alone, you hear?
Get him out of here.
Because you'll get joy and grace all over
when you finally meet your maker.
Get off me!
Where are you, you bastard?
You want to send me a reward
for finding that wallet of yours?
Tell me where the fuck you are, right now.
No, I'll tell you where the fuck you are.
You're in my end of the fucking sewer,
buddy.
I say who lives. I say who dies.
Now, you better get that through
your fucking skull,
because there's no more warnings.
I'm coming for some fucking family time.
No. You listen to me.
You go near my family...
and I will cut out your goddamn guts
like I did your fucking friend,
you hear me?
He wasn't my friend.
He was my brother.
And now I'm coming for the rest
of your family.
You just bought them
a death sentence, motherfucker.
Wait.
Don't.
Fuck...
Nick, what's going on?
Pick up...
Nick?
Honey, are you okay?
Is Luke home from school?
Yes, we're fine.
All right,
just stay there till the police come.
Promise me.
Why, what's wrong?
Honey, just stay there
till the police get there.
I'm on my way.
Oh, come on...
Hey, can I have Detective Wallis, please?
Detective Wallis
Give me Detective Wallis, right now.
Shit.
Homicide, this is Wallis.
They threatened my family.
Mr. Hume?
Fucking trash...
threatened to kill my family.
All right, where is your family right now?
They're at home.
They're both at home.
Just help us, please.
Helen? Luke?
Nick?
God.
What the hell is happening?
Honey, why the police...?
Nick, you're scaring me.
Oh! God.
Nick, talk to me.
Dad, what's going on?
Nick.
What's going on?
You stay there.
Thank God you're here.
Your son was a hockey player.
Yes.
The car will stay here tonight.
Now, Mr. Hume,
I think it's time you told me...
exactly who did what to whom?
You make war on the wrong dog, hm?
That what you did?
Thought you could just go kill
some little asshole
because you live all the way out here?
What are you saying?
What is she saying, Nick?
I've done nothing wrong.
Well, then,
why don't you tell me how you make
Billy Darley this pissed off at you?
You asked for my help.
All right.
All right.
Just try to get through tonight, Mr. Hume.
And be grateful you're still alive.
But if you started a war...
God help you.
What have you done?
How do I make it stop?
Did you start it?
Listen...
I don't really care what happens to me.
I just need them to be safe.
Tell me how to stop this?
Well, first of all,
do everything they tell you.
Everything.
Don't worry, Mr. Hume.
We've put out an APB
for Billy and his gang.
I can't believe I didn't see
what was going on with you.
How could you do what you did?
You thought you could balance the equation?
Put order in the universe?
I lost my boy.
Your boy.
You are a good father.
And nothing that's happened changes that.
And I love you.
And I always will.
It's good that
you're getting rid of it anyway.
Yeah.
No.
Mom.
Fucking get out.
Mom.
Get over here.
Get over here.
Sup, Billy.
No.
No.
No.
Tonight I lack the strengthen to even move.
And you walked and watched me die.
But I know this is harder for you.
Because love has beat you down.
Yeah, come on.
You know you're not alone.
Doctor.
Doctor.
Hold the legs.
Sedate him.
Hold him down.
Can you turn that off?
The monitor or your heart?
I'll ask the doctor.
This thing stops. Right now.
God knows why you're still alive,
but you're being given a second chance.
You think that officer's out there
protecting you?
He's protecting you from yourself?
He'll haul your ass right to jail
if I say so.
You want your retribution,
and you killed a couple of punks,
and it bought you what?
Everybody thinks they're right in a war.
Everybody still dies in the end.
You were never going to win this, Mr. Hume.
Nobody is.
I killed them.
I killed my family.
Well, your son's still alive.
What?
Barely.
Where is he?
Is he here? Where is he?
Hey, come on. Wait a second now.
Luke.
Luke.
Luke?
- He's alright. Let him go.
- Lucas?
- Sir, you need to get back to bed.
- Where is my son?
Tell me where my son is.
He's in room 206.
Lukey?
Luke?
We're taking care of your son.
- Doctor... It's ok. Just let him through.
- Luke?
Is he going to wake up?
I can't say right now.
It was never going to balance.
What did you say?
The equation.
Sometimes it's just chaos.
That's all there is.
I'd like a minute with him.
Please.
I'll be waiting.
Hey, Luke, can you hear me?
Can you move your fingers?
Son, just move your fingers
if you can hear me.
Luke, I know that
you think that...
I didn't care about you
as much as your brother.
God, I...
I don't know, maybe I didn't at first.
You know...
when you mom and I
first had Brendan...
he was just...
he was so amazing to me, you know.
He was like this miracle kid.
But I always knew exactly
what to expect with him.
And then when you came along...
I don't know, I kind of expected to
have another Brendan, you know.
I expected you to be just like him,
but you weren't.
I mean you were so different,
just different than him, different than me.
You were just so much more...
so much more like your mom, you know...
stubborn and...
Too much passion.
Your mother.
Oh, she meant the world to me.
And so do you.
I just want you to know that I love you.
I love you so much.
I love your brother
and I love your mother...
I love our family
and I...
I'm so sorry
that I wasn't a better father.
I'm so sorry
that I couldn't protect you guys.
Shit.
Hey you, get a doctor, right now.
Hey, Owen.
I need you to check a number for me.
Yeah, 5550128.
Well, check somewhere else.
Just get it for me.
And the savings too, huh?
Yeah, everything.
All of it.
Pulling out the kids' college fund, huh?
Hello?
Hey, Nick, it's Owen.
Yeah, I got that number run.
It's a bar. 'The Four Roses.'
Nick, what's going on?
Do you need me to call anyone?
Thanks. Goodbye. Owen.
Nick?
I'm looking for Billy Darley
or any of his friends.
"IN SPANISH"
"IN SPANISH"
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Fuck you. Back it up.
Let me go...
You tell me where Billy Darley is.
Tell me right now.
Right now.
You don't want Billy Darley, buddy.
I got business with him.
Okay, let me go.
Let me go.
"IN SPANISH"
His boy Heco is crashing at 113,
up the block.
He's usually hooking up
around dinner time, you know?
Okay?
"IN SPANISH"
One more thing.
I need to buy some guns.
Help you?
I need guns.
I don't know you.
I came from the 'Four Roses.'
I'm going to guess
you're a little bit far from home.
Well, don't let me smell fear on you.
Fear is for the enemy.
Fear
and bullets.
Lots of fucking bullets.
You got the bastard of bastards.
.357...
for guaranteed head removal.
That's a sweetie.
You got your standard size.45,
super size.
That's a fucking 'Hungry Man' right there.
And you got the king of mayhem.
Half cannon, sword of justice.
Take this fucker to the Holy Land,
start your own crusade.
Any one of these...
is bound to make you feel better
about what's bothering you.
What about that one?
This one?
All right, I'll take this and these.
That's three fucking grand worth
of killing.
You got three grand worth of killing to do?
There's five.
Well, that makes
you a preferred customer.
I'm going to give you some accessories.
Just because you got a thing about you.
You have got a killing thing about you...
you surely do.
You the motherfucker after my son Billy?
He's your son?
That'd make you
the motherfucker killed Joe, that right?
You killed my youngest?
Now you're after Billy, yeah?
Yeah, I'm after him.
Well, Billy is no damn doing of mine.
Anything he did is no damn doing of mine.
So somebody needs to
make somebody pay for something
to make themselves feel better...
Billy'd be the one to pay.
Kill the little piss-pants.
See if it makes
a damn day's difference to me.
Dad to dad,
don't tell me about it.
Just go do it.
Lord knows I've been patient.
And you're a cash fucking customer.
But you think about
asking me where Billy is.
I'll kill you.
Go your way, now.
Go with God...
and a bag full of guns.
Going to focus on the pain.
The...
What the fuck?
What the fuck? Who the fuck?
You?
We fucking killed you.
What the fuck?
Get the fuck out of here.
Where is Billy?
Fuck you.
That's my tooth, you asshole.
Tell me where the fuck he is.
The office.
The office.
What the fuck is that?
It's the abandoned mental hospital.
It's where we cook our shit, dude.
It's by the bridge on Stygian Street.
All right, man? Stygian Street.
Call him.
Good thing your daddy
got you some training wheels...
so you don't have to Rollerblade over here
for your fucking sister's habit, huh?
She's been a good customer
of mine for a while.
I been a pretty great customer of hers too.
Fucking prick.
Heco, you sandbagging son of a bitch...
it is the second time this week...
- I had to cover for your ass.
- Billy.
That fucker didn't die, Billy.
That fucker didn't die, Billy.
What the fuck are you talking about?
He says you're sentenced.
So what?
So this, motherfucker.
What are we fucking up tonight, son?
What the fuck do you want now?
You look like you're in a fucking hurry.
You know how much I got to
wipe your fucking nose?
I got to get some
Fortune Five Hundred faggot off my back...
by telling him he can fucking have you,
you think I enjoyed that?
What you don't get is...
I care about what happens to you
because it can fucking hurt me.
Now do you need any more
fucking instructions?
No. Thanks, dad.
I'm taking the car.
What the fuck?
Shit.
Dog.
Son of a bitch is coming.
Straight at you, man.
My leg.
Dog.
Go. You fuck.
I'm gonna kill you.
Son of the bitch.
Go get him. Go...
Come on...
...Go that way...
You know you're going to die in here.
Fuck.
Look at you.
You look like one of us.
Look what I made you.
Ready?
Tonight I lack the strengthen to even move.
And you walked and watched me die.
But I know this is harder for you.
Because love has beat you down.
Yeah, come on.
You know you're not alone.
Any New Year's resolutions?
No, you know mom's perfect.
Oh, well, that's for sure.
Nah, I got nothing.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
All right, what do you expect this year?
Your son.
He started moving.
I think he's going to pull through.
Should old acquaintance be forgot.
And never brought to mind.
