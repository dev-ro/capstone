After getting lots of
beating we learnt...
...the multiplication table
of nine by heart.
With a small trick we can
learn the tables easily.
Everybody knows how much is 9 x 9.
- 81!
Ok, 4+4 = 8. Again one is left.
Eight and one is eighty-one.
Thank you.
Now let's see the multiplication
of nine...
...with another method.
How much is 9 x 5?
- 45!
All right.
How does this magic trick happen?
Normally we calculate
with left-brain.
And we think and act
with right brain.
The arithmetic's, geometry & algebra
which we did through the left-brain...
...if we can think it visually
in the right brain...
...and store it in the memory
we can do it easily.
We can avoid the boring continuous
studying and memorising by this method.
Even Einstein who has
given many presents...
The first project of our
science club is of Mannu.
Very good Mannu.
Next is a scientific
poem by Sabina S.
When Pippette and burette is squeezed,
permanganate changes it's colour...
When hydrogen and oxygen hug,
the world gets wet with water...
Though she can't see properly,
her aim is perfect.
Stand up, stand up Anjali!
You think you are a kid?
Teacher... that... I...
- Enough, enough, no explanations.
Don't tear the duster bring it here.
I saw you doing mischief.
Stand there till the class is over.
Silence, silence, continue.
Anjali!
How about a pizza?
It's my birthday today!
- Wow! Happy birthday Anjali!
Many many happy returns of the day.
- Thank you.
Happy Birthday to you!
Happy birthday dear Anjali!
Happy birthday to you!
Many many happy returns of the day.
- Thank you.
Happy birthday!
- Thank you.
Lemon juice is enough.
- You miser!
Don't worry I will pay. You
won't get lemon juice here.
Why are you nervous?
Forget about that, where is my
birthday gift? - Birthday gift?
I didn't know it was your birthday.
Last time I gave chocolates
to everyone.
But I bought ice cream
for you, then?
I don't remember that.
You are very smart.
This time I didn't give even
chocolates to the friends.
And gave this party to you.
If mummy knows... - Ok, ok, keep quiet.
Close your eyes. Get ready
for a dream journey.

The pay scale which was implemented

...has not been revised

The government has cheated 5.5 lakhs

Friends...
Friends, since last eight years...

Last year the price of the petrol and

Hello... Hello... Who?
Come, call for you.
Who is that?
Hello... What happened?
It's only 5 o'clock.
That's right.
I am in a meeting.
Don't worry, I'll go to school & see.
And will come back soon.
We have forced him to stay
away from sports and NCC.
Don't divert him to
any other things now.
Let him study as much as he
can. He will get a rank.
I am not teaching him for the rank.
And also don't have intentions to send him
for medicine & engineering.
You are right, Sir.
Now nobody wants doctors
and engineers.
Now the demand is for IT field.
The salaries are more than lakhs.
Sir, that won't last long.
Most importantly...
...one must have a respectable
profession, like the IAS.
For that just memorising is
not enough. One must have...
...good attitude, particularly
general knowledge.
That's right, but the civil
services are very tough.
There is no need to tell,
you know Sir.
Luck plays a very important role.
Isn't it Sir?
- Yes.
Why are you going like a rocket?
Not rocket Paati; I am very late.
What is this?
- I am sorry, uncle.
I am very sorry.
- Please help me and go!
I am too late; see you.
Go, go, everybody is waiting
to welcome you.
Where were you, Sir?
- Your tuition is over?
Oh my God! You scared
us. Where were you?
Why are you laughing? We
searched you everywhere.
Mother, why have you locked
this? Open it fast.
My head is paining.
- He is lying.
He is trying to change the subject.
The liar is... Don't worry,
I will show you!
Look, father has come.
- Don't change the subject.
Where were you all this time?
- Father is also late.
Answer me. - We both will answer
in details. Will that do?
The assembly is adjourned for now.
And everybody can go home,
c'mon aunty.
Sister, you are right, there
is something fishy.
That's why he is trying to be smart.
This is called as mischief, dear.
What are you doing?
- Father, I am applying the soap.
Apply nicely, but you are two
hours late to reach home.
Father, it's not two hours.
- No, then come out fast, dear.
We are waiting for
your explanations.
Father, you know vivek?
- Which?
The one who comes from
the temple junction?
The one who was there
in the NCC last year?
He is captain this year, isn't it?
- Yes.
We came together on the bicycle.
Suddenly he fainted on the way.
I kept the bicycle in a shop.
And dropped him at home in an auto.
His mother forced me to
have tea. So I was late.
Then you could have called us, fool.
Didn't I tell you, he won't
go anywhere unnecessarily?
Anyway, the exam is nearing.
Don't go anywhere without
informing us. - Thank God!
When I was studying in class IV,
I didn't inform at home & went to
play Kettu Panthu after the school.
Kettu Panthu? What is that father?
In those days, unlike today children
didn't have money to buy ball...
We used to make
ball with plastics and all.
The game was very interesting
and I was late.
When I didn't reach home,
father, Sukumaran...
...and Prasannan and everyone
searched for me.
Those days the children
were kidnapped.
Somehow they found me
and father beat me.
Mother was waiting with
the cane at home.
I ran around the house and
she couldn't catch me.
She ran after me with the
cane around the house.
It is said that the
mother's breast would swell...
...if you run around the house.
They caught and beat me badly.
For not informing and telling lies.
But I was benefited.
Since then, up to this age,
I have never said lies.
Poor mother, it was she who
beat me and scolded me.
It was easy to fool father.
You know, mother loved me very much.
See, his eyes are filled with tears.
Don't pick it with the
hand it will hurt you.
Why are you crying?
Don't worry; it was a free jug.
Don't worry; we have one more jug.
I... I lied to father.
- That's ok, ok, that's ok.
Father, I am sorry.
When you explained, I forgave
you from my heart.
I was smiling inside thinking that you've the
same heart that I had in my childhood.
Father and son, both
are same, isn't it?
Uncle, uncle, this won't do.
- What dear?
The combined study. The
new syllabus says that...
...the children should study
according to their feelings.
Don't shout at midnight.
With your teachings, he tries
to be smart in the school.
Is it? - That blind girl is excited...
...because her father
is coming from Gulf.
Mannu, how many times I told you...
...not to insult others
even casually?
When daddy comes, do combined
study with him.
Very good,
My father knows only to count
the seeds of the dates.
Both are gossiping instead
of studying?
Get up, get up. Now study after
having food. - Come.
You'll be bored if you read or write a subject
for more than a 20 minutes at a stretch.
If you relax, you will be freshened.
Manju, switch off the
TV and have food.
Give it here, mother. - Also I
will arrange your bed there.
She just wants to watch the
cartoons all the time.
Your eyes will be damaged.
Then your eyes would have damaged
by this time for watching the serials.
In our days we had to write
essays of 4 to 5 pages.
Even if you study hard,
you will forget the
points of the way that Sher Shah ruled.
So father taught us a trick.
Assume Sher Shah as a tall
man like Amitabh Bachchan.
Not Amitabh Bachchan, father.
Mamooty will do.
All right, it's Mamooty.
Then the ministers, bodyguards
and everybody...
...place them with our
favourite actors.
And it was like the film Lagan.
History was converted into a movie.
The points are their dialogues.
Won't you be able to write
a story of a movie which you have seen?
Yes.
- It's just like that.
Even the word Sarkar is the
contribution of Sher Shah.
My dear son, don't tell all
this to your teachers.
They will think your
father is crazy.
No, our teacher says
father is a genius.
The teacher is still in doubt,
why father didn't get IAS.
He wants to take class from father.
- Enough dear.
If I fall from here I won't escape.
Compass. - Father... Father...
you had promised.
You promised that
you would not tell.
What is it, father? What is compass?
Look, I will not talk to you
if you don't keep the promise.
Mother, what is compass?
- Don't know.
Why you are called compass?
- It's not a compass.
It's protractor.
- Now I got it.
It's something related
to rotating, isn't it?
Compass!
- Compass means...
Look father, you shouldn't say.
- It has gone.
Father, you should promise me.
I swear...
- I swear...
I will not say what compass is.
I will not say what compass
is. Did you hear?
I swear, I swear, I swear.
The teenagers are like
the baby monkeys.
It keeps on changing.
Should they study or play?
Should they study or love?
Oh I see, so that is compass.
- It's not that.
Though it's nothing serious,
I have promised him.
Both father and son shouldn't
have secrets.
If it is so, I am not there.
C'mon get up, get up.
Lucky.
The sky and the moonlight.
Haven't you heard this?
You might have not heard...
Because I wrote this poem
when I was in the college.
What's the use of blaming
the children?
He too will have the
habits of the father.
He is the true photocopy.
The children are always kids for us.
Though they are grown up
but they will remain as kids for us.

What happened?
- A cat has come in the way.
Look mother, the cat too
is with the family.
If I hadn't applied the brake,
the family would have died.
The aunty which died...
- Not aunty, she is grandma.
She is my aunt.
- Yes, the grandma...
...the cat would go to
heaven after death?
That depends on ones deed.
Will the children understand
by saying deeds and destiny?
Yes, it's the destiny that
father married you.
You are very smart.
Father, would you have married
someone else than her?
We have to suffer everything here.
Yes, or else you could have seen.
There was an old affair, dear.
- Don't talk rubbish to children.
I know. Its aunt Shoba, isn't it?
- It was adolescence, dear.
Then someone else would
have been your progeny.
Poor mother, her stomach is

The union are just saying that
they will go on strike.
But they are not as active as they
used to be. Isn't it Ramesh?
The government has agreed
to take action soon.
It's like that, till the election
they will pull on.
They will implement in
the last minute when...
...they are about to leave the chair.
The one who is taking over
will face the consequences.
Grandpa!
- When did you all come?
We went home and came.
Is there anyone to come?
Shall we proceed?
Who is going to light the fire?
Call him.
The brother-in-laws have started
drinking in the morning itself.
Because the hands should not
shiver while lighting.
It's nice that she is dead.
Who is going to look after her?
When did brother-in-law come?
Come, you too can light.
There was no need for
you to come in a hurry.
You wasted the money unnecessarily.
For what?
To see the drunkards dancing?
Aunty loved me more
than Reghu and Shoba. Isn't it?
Love?
That's why she forgot her words
and married her daughter to NRI.
Then what happened?
Didn't you see her sitting there?
She taught the children
of the village.
But her children couldn't
learn anything good.
It's all in the destiny.
Grandpa, grandpa, it's your luck...
...that you got a daughter-in-law
like mother.
You are very smart.
If you study nicely...
...we will make you the Prime
minister like Indira Gandhi.
Grandpa, she doesn't want
to become Indira Gandhi.
She wants to become Sonia
Gandhi. Isn't it?
That's good, so you are
her master, isn't it?
These days the children talk like
the dialogues of the serial.
Baird would have never thought
it would become so worse.
Mother, like father,
grandpa too is a GK.
Father, did you hear?
She said you too have a
good general knowledge.
Now it's rusted.
Kunje!
- I am here.
Give the cows something to eat.
- Fine.
Grandpa too was young like
you. Now he is old.
Chandran, I forgot about you.
Did you eat something?
There was a wine shop
near by, from there...
So you found that also?
One finds the church and
the wine shop first.
You know why?
Because both are addictions.
We should have some
hot rice with ghee.
That's your mother's special.
I am not able to control myself
after seeing father's expression.
You all can have it.
It is best for the cholesterol.
Now there is no need for
me to see all that.
It's very hard to get up.
When your mother comes
into my memory...
...I have rice with the ghee.
It's really comforts.
He too is like that.
He cries when a tasty ginger
curry is served...
...he remembers mother.
- It's like that.
Nobody can take the taste
and the fragrance.
That will be there.
- Enough, enough.
Now both of you go and take bath.
I will manage things over here.
Now c'mon, vacate the place.
C'mon!

Take it!

Did it hurt you?
- No, this pain is wonderful.
Then I will do it once again.
Father sometimes behaves like a kid.
When I am with you, I
really become a child.
Because I don't have to worry.
As you are there to look
after everything.
The hot water is ready
shall I bring it?
Today I will bathe with him.
He is very helpful.
I wanted to tell you something.
But then thought not to tell.
But as one by one is leaving us...
...sometimes I am very scared
when I get up in the morning.
Yes, I feel like the soul is
going to reject the old body.
You are thinking unnecessary things.
In the morning the sugar level
of the body gets low.
Come with us to Trivandrum.
We'll do the detail check up
and stay there for some days.
That won't work.
If you try, won't you get a deputation
transfer somewhere near? - Yes.
But the way it's going, if
there is no other problem...
...I can at least retire
as a joint secretary.
Like you wished... I couldn't
become a collector.
Through Mannu I want to achieve it.
It's a wish... And if it's there...
You are right... I forgot that.
Everyone... is selfish
about their child.
Even both us.
Father, I am here whenever you call.
I am just a call away.
But it's not we who
are going to call.
Don't take him with
you wherever you go.
And waste the time of his studies.
IAS and all are just about
chance and luck.
Kunje!
- Yes.
Bring the hot water.
My dear, how many times
did I tell you?
The company hasn't designed
this to wrap up like this.
Let others also see.
Wear it properly.
I am not going for any
government job to dress properly.
My mother says you should
always dress properly.
I have done this many
times for mother.
Shall I come in?
- Come, come.
There is nothing that you can't see.
When did you come?
She is yet to learn
how to wear sari?
You know Mr. Ramesh. He
wants to do everything.
He won't allow me even
to apply vermilion.
Did you see how she has
changed her colour when the job is over?
Now you wear yourself. Where
is my pant and shirt?
It is kept on the table.
Now see how she is going
to wear the sari?
It's all your luck.
It's nice.
How is brother Soman?
Didn't you see his condition
yesterday?
Most of the days are like that.
He starts early in the morning.
Now the condition is he
doesn't feel hungry.
And doesn't want food. All the time...
These are some acute symptoms.
If you know some doctors
in the medical college...
You don't need that.
Just take an appointment
and see them.
Come! - You too come, Shoba. - Come
Come sister, let's have tea.
- I didn't tell him.
And if I am not there when he wakes up
that's enough for todays quarrel.
There is hot Chena and
chutney, have some.
This is normal dish for
us, isn't it uncle.
They have come from town,
let them have it.
Now we will have this for
couple of months in town.
Sit there.
- She talks like her father.
Why are you sitting quiet?
Is it because you are
grown up? Are you shy?
He is in college now,
look at his moustache.
Now soon he will become
like the father. - Yes.
After the Sanjayanam, I
will come there with him.
You all eat; you have
to go, isn't it?
I am going, he will
start shouting now!
That... The willingness of the
patient is most important.
She would have been happy...
At least if she had a child.
Tell brother Soman things in detail.
The patient should also
have the desire.
Then only the medicine will affect.
Shoba... I thought of asking before.
I used to tease you... in childhood.
I forgot the name.
Since yesterday I am thinking
about the name.
What was it? The Kannama
of Bardhiar...
...Changampazham Ramanan...
...sang the love song as if it
was copied from the film.
You don't remember, isn't it?
You called me with that name
when I was in class II.
You said that you
would never forget.
Let me stay in your heart
for some more time.
Then you will remember everything.
Aunty... Always called
her... With a name...
Since yesterday... I am trying...
to remember.
But I can't remember.
Then don't keep that in your
heart even for a second now.
It is Changirikutty, isn't it?
- Oh my God!
Is this... I forgot?
Brother, I will sit on the side
seat. - You sit at back.
How many times I told
father to build a road?
It wouldn't have been
so difficult then.
There is no difficulty. It's because
you are not used to.
Kunje, take this also.
- Yes.
If you cut the road from
that side, the vehicle...
. can also come and also
there will be less steps. - Yes, yes.
What is the use of the road which is built
at the cost of betel nuts and pepper.
The thing is... Joseph
has shown me a car.
Thought it's second hand,
it's in good condition.
That I understood, its
Joseph isn't it?
This Joseph has arranged the flat
for you, isn't it? - Yes.
I have given the salary
certificate and all.
That is bank's formality.
But this doesn't require anything.
Joseph has arranged for private CC.
Father... Rent a cars have
good demand in Trivandrum.
We can pay the CC.
- Where this is to be kept?
And we can use it for
our personal use too.
Dear, get down and sit at
the back. Let me keep this.
That won't do, seats
are meant to sit.
This is for you!
- Then I will sit at the back.
Move.
- I will sit on the side.
Ok. - I am paying you Rs. 50 extra.
Bye grandpa.
- Bye... Bye.
Father, you didn't say anything.
- What should I say?
If you are talking about building the road,
right now I am not interested in it.
And if it is about purchasing
the car and the flat...
...you and Joseph have
already decided it.
You can have everything step
by step, remember that.
You don't have the luck to park the car
in front of the house.
Next time when I come I
will park there and come.
All right, I will be there
to welcome you. Go man!
It has become a routine affair
to fight while going.
You didn't even tell us about
the car. Then why did you...
Yes, I feel very sad to
leave father alone.
Father likes this than to say bye.
He will scold me whole day today.
C'mon brother, let's go.
Why uncle, it's not moving?
- How can it move?
The dickey is over loaded.
How is this?
What is the cost of this sari?
The cost of this sari Rs.
400 in that shop.
Sister, give me Rs. 375 for this.
Annachi, the same sari is
available for Rs. 350.
The colour would be little darker.
Not colour sister,
the price is high.
We all buy from the same market.
When you go to his shop and buy.
There is no demand when
I come here to the shop.
Sister, look at this...
- Enough, enough...
To sell your cheap clothes...
...why are you taking
the support of Devi?
You won't allow them to work
in the morning, isn't it?
Because of you these files are
wandering here and there.
Madam Sarla, you've lot of problems when I
ask for the money for the loan you've taken.
Good. - It's good, isn't it?
Buy it, buy it.
Now because of me don't be
without clothes on Pongal.
Sir, it's on instalment.
- First let her give my instalment.
You can do whatever you want
because it's a government office?
C'mon, c'mon move.
This huge office is working...
...to collect income
tax and sale tax.
And if all the people start
direct marketing like you...
...they will not have money
to pay our salary.
You can't do business
inside. Go out.
Sir, why are you talking like this?
- Go, go man!
Special offer!
Joseph, what's the matter with
Annachi early in the morning?
What to say Mr. Vijayan?
Somehow I manage to collect
money from the superiors.
And the ladies are crazy about
these colourful dresses.
I will lose the money.
Now another guy will come
with pickles and Papadam.
It's nice you have reminded.
Or else I'd have forgotten the
instalment of the chit fund.
Can do some adjustment.
- No adjustment Mr. Vijayan.
I have already said it,
isn't it Joseph?
Sir, why do you need money now?
You need money when the
deal of the car is fixed.
You are not keeping your words.
- It's not that.
Mr. Raman... There is a jeweller...
What's his name...
...I forgot... In the ad the
child sings... Whatever...
He won a necklace, that's
an adjustment.
Half of the money has
to be paid back.
Then too it is profitable.
- That is there.
But I need it urgently.
The exams are nearing.
I want to buy an inverter.
Now the power cut is
for half an hour.
The power cut will go on increase.
Sir, you don't have to hurry.
By the time it is fixed
in the quarters...
...it will start raining. And by
that time the flat will be ready.
Joseph has a plan for everything.
He will never say no.
Dear Sir, you can't pull
on with interim relief.
Sir, if you are lucky you will get the
money today itself.
Hamji, you have come
after so many days.
He is right. We are waiting
for the interim relief.
He has got a good setup in Trivandrum
than our secretaries...
It's all planning!
He is not depending on the salary.
Thiruvallur says that one
who toils hard prospers.
That means... - Mr. Ramesh,
can you come here please?
The rich become richer.
- The system is hanged.
And those who don't, becomes poor.
So says, Thiruvalluvar.
Or else you can chew betel nuts like this.
Isn't it vijayan?
Look, don't make goal
in your free time.
You are very lucky.
I heard that you have won the prize.
How did you know?
- That I came to know.
You should tell everyone once
you have won big prizes.
It'll be published in the
newspaper next week with photo.
We should celebrate it.
She will celebrate,
that is for sure.
Mr. Ramesh, minister is calling you.
Do one thing, call 2341277 and...
...ask them to do the service
of the computer.
Perhaps its memory power
has to be increased.
Though I have said many times...
...Mr. Ramesh Nair is
absolutely right.
The proposal of express highway...
...is going through your place.
Because of this reason we can't give you
the permission to construct the building.
It's not that, you can...
- I alone can't do anything.
Must agree.
Why did you all come all
the way from Malabar?
There is no use.
We are instructed to govern
without looking...
...at the face of the people.
Is that possible?
If we don't look at the
face of the people...
...who has given us the power,
can we come here again.
This is just to fool the people.
The express highway will
not be constructed.
And even if it is constructed, when?
The building should be raised
before the expressway is laid.
Before that the building
is to be constructed.
The road has to be diverted if
the building is constructed.
And there is sufficient
place for that.
No problem Mr. Kanji. Roads
must have diversions.
The vehicles have the steering.
Sir, there was another women with the same
case who came here with special request.
You said the concept of the
highway would be lost.
I can't write different reports
for the cases of same nature.
All right, you don't right Sir.
You make a report in such a way that
nobody points you out.
But make it fast.
Actually, you all are
ruling the state.
We just among
the people isn't it?
Central
He is the union leader and
doesn't allow anything.
Nawas, go and meet him.
- Yes.
Things are not like they used to be.
You can't believe the game of the power.
It may fall any time.
You don't have to think
too much about it.
Money is not a problem for Khamji.
Sir, look at him and learn.
Why does he come and
ask for pickles?
Because he knows the needy.
That is his plan.
How is it? - Nice.
Mr. Ramesh has brought
pack lunch today?
I brought some leaves
from native place.
I feel like eating packed lunch.
It's really tasty to
eat in the leaves.
But these day's leaves
are not available.
Sir, you don't have to take tension.
Just give me the report
without details.
I will make the rest of the plan.
Because it's the permission of the five star
hotel just an inverter won't do.
I will also pay the advance
for the car, isn't it Sir?
Give me the sample.
Is it sour? - No, it is sweet.
Son has started revising?
No, the syllabus is yet to finish.
My daughter says he knew some
new tricks for learning.
Mr. Ramesh, please teach
us the technique.
The principle says to
take a class with...
...students and the parents
in the next PTA meeting.
If you don't take leave
and teach our daughter...
...our daughter will fail. Apply
for leave today itself.
The people of Kerala are ahead...
...as far as people in Kerala are
concerned, they are very patient.
We are also ahead in divorce
and suicides than anybody.
I am not saying this.
The report has come in the India Today
after 2 yrs of clinical survey.
Note it down.
Divorce... The separation.
Suicides... Kill ourselves.
Separation and kill,
two negative words.
We got this knowledge
from education.
Though we took control
of many things...
...through education, are
we living happily? No.
For many educated people here,
life is a failure.
But then, why should we
study? Am I correct?
You buy new clothes
for your children.
You buy them computer and cycles.
You buy mobile phones
and bike for them.
You buy many things what they
need & what they don't.
But have you ever caressed them?
Have you ever kissed
them on their forehead?
Central
From a newborn to everyone,
desires this touch.
The touching and caressing is enough
to stop the breaking of the relationship.
This is lesson one.
I challenge the fathers
who have come here...
...to tell the truth. You
must be thinking what?
Can you come forward and tell
the lady sitting besides you...
...that she is smart and
beautiful than your wife?
If not openly, at least do you have the guts
to tell in your wife's ear?
No, and even if you have
the guts, you won't tell.
Because, because your wife
would never like it.
They can't tolerate that.
They will be disturbed mentally.
Then after seeing the marks
of other children...
why do you blame your children?
You compare your child
with other children.
That doesn't bring spirit
and enthusiasm in them.
This makes them lazy.
We should appreciate even
their petty talents.
This is lesson No. 2 and 3.
Play with your children.
Study and share with them.
Listen to them,
understand and trust.
Build up their confidence.
I stood before the mike when I
was in class X. I was very shy.
But I still remember the poem
I sang written by Bhartiyar.
Mahakavi Bharathiyar's song
I wanted to be here on time,
but I was stuck somewhere.
Silence please, silence.
So increase your energy level.
If you look at the great
personalities of the world...
...they walk very fast.
For example Mahatma Gandhi,
Martin Luther King.
Even our former chief
minister K Karunakaran!
And even our principal.
Sir, don't smile and sit aside.
Come here. Please.
He is the one who teaches
our children.
So we should know if he is intelligent
and has a good memory.
Don't worry, I will not
create any problem, come.
Watch carefully, everyone can
participate in the memory test.
I will say ten words.
Let us see if you recollect
that in the same order.
Corridor, student, daughter,
hotel, pizza, gift, happy birthday...
...window, Inquilab
Zindabad, secretariat.
Try if you can say in
the same order, Sir.
First corridor.
- Corridor... daughter...
Students... students...
Ok, daughter comes
after the student. Next.
Ok, anybody from the audience?
Madam. - Me?
Please come. - I don't know. - Please
come forward, you can. - Go, go.
Give the phone over there.
We will see how we can store this
in our memory with a small trick.
I will make her tell all
the ten words in order.
You will tell if you know, isn't it?
You will not lie, isn't it?
Come, come on sit down.
Please cooperate with me.
You all too can try. Sit straight.
Close your eyes.
Take a long breath and
hold it for sometime.
Exhale slowly.
A deep breathe,
hold it for a while.
Then slowly release.
Do it five times.
No one will open his or her eyes.
Visualise the things I am saying.
The corridor or your child's school.
A student is walking
in the corridor.
Your daughter is also
there, can you see?
Corridor, students, daughter.
He or she is going to a hotel...
...with a friend for
a birthday party.
They buy a pizza... Pizza.
She raises her hand for the gift.
Gift.
They sang the birthday song.
When they looked out of
the window, they saw...
...a protestation shouting
Inquilab Zindabad...
...going towards the Secretariat.
Window, Inquilab Zindabad,
Secretariat. The story ends.
Open your eyes slowly.
Open eyes slowly...
Now try, you can start from the end.
Secretariat... - Before the
Secretariat, the protestors...
No, no, don't tell the story.
That you remember in your mind.
Just tell the words.
Secretariat, Inquilab Zindabad,
window, happy birthday, gift...
...pizza, hotel, daughter,
students, corridor!
You said it, isn't it Compass?
Stupid! - Yes.
Everyone wants to see the
children of principal getting failed.
Look forward and drive. They just
want some excuse to fail.
This is our Mannu, isn't it?
Central
You advise everyone to study.
But the father and the son
are playing here, isn't it?
Study is combined with the play.
The play is combined with the study.
Every small thing can teach a lesson.
Greetings.
- Where are you all going on Sunday?
We were going to your
home to see you.
Why this musical instrument?
The art festival is
around the corner.
Nobody should say that my children
didn't learn the arts.
So I admitted all of them.
Bhagwadhar knows only one song.
What is that, my dear?
Bharathiar writes this poem.
But at least a couple of them
sing this poem every year.
All the children are his students.
There won't be many
as it is in Tamil.
You can win the prize
with little effort.
She remembers the poem you
recited at the meeting.
That would be something different.
That is also Bharathiar's poem.
And for children... It's romantic.
No problem Sir. The teachers
don't put the marks...
...and the children don't sing
after knowing its meaning.
Teacher, we don't
have the knowledge.
But don't think that
everyone is like us.
If Mr. Ramesh can sing when
he was in Class X...
...then there is no problem singing
in the Class IX for her.
Sir, please sing, I will record it.
- Now? I can't, I am tired.
Good evening Sir, good evening.
I will write it... And he will
bring it to the school.
There is no use of writing;
it has to be sung.
If you could sing, today is Sunday
we can teach her today itself.
Stop it Mummy.
- Now we don't need this.
Shall I record? Sing softly.
What is this?
It is on the tip of the tongue,
but I am not getting it.
Don't know what has happened?
That happens sometimes. Even if
you know, we forget sometimes.
You want Mannu to sing this poem?
If it were like that, I would
have said it before.
Teacher, I do only classical music.
No way, Sir.
I will record it at home
and send it to school.
Also write it. Because we
don't know the language.
And we will mess it up.
- You are right.
Dear, remind father.
- All right teacher.
Ok bye.
- Bye.
If you don't get a good
jump, then smashing...
Placing is more important
than smashing and jumping.
For that you have to look into
the eyes of the opponents.
And not just look at
the ball and jump.
Look at his eyes and read his mind.
Uncle, what is this? Are you
going to open a cool bar?
If not cool bar, there are
chances of opening a bar.
Uncle Varghese has landed.
Plenty of soda is required.
So you have won the
lottery, brother!
It is said that the face is
the mirror of the heart.
Our eyes are the mirrors.
We can catch any thoughts from it.
Eyes are the mirror of the heart,
my aunt always said.
So you catch all the mischief
from my eyes, isn't it?
Don't break the door; I am coming.
Why do you always shut the door?
Is there any treasure hidden inside?
You can't leave the door open.
Uncle verghese has come.
- We know that.
Hello Ramesh.
- Hello.
What is the news?
How are the secretariat
and the government?
There is no problem, isn't it?
Uncle, you have come without
any notice and memo.
What to say? The Arabic
issues notice and memo.
No, I don't smoke.
Mannu, how are your studies?
- No problem.
So you are studying
to create problem?
You will get a rank
this year, isn't it?
Or you are just playing?
- There is no need to worry about Mannu.
Look at her, how she is going
along with her dance and studies.
Aunty, what is this?
Uncle has come with Bhagwadhar
from Dubai?
He is in great demand.
Some of the actresses
are his students.
Sir, the fridge is full. What to do
with the left over sodas?
Just a minute.
Why are you teaching in the evening?
You can't learn the course
of one year in a week.
This is a capsule dance.
It is a youth festival special.
For the dance he is
mixing everything.
He has brought an
Arabic song with him.
There won't be many children
as it is an Arabic poem.
Sophie, please come here.
If she doesn't get a prize.
I can't raise the head in the office.
'For Bharathiar, Kannamma
was not just his lover.'
'Kannama was his language,
she was everything.'
Mahakavi Bharathiyar's song
'Why it's raining now?
Come children, come.'
Mannu, take a pen and the paper.
- Why father?
I remember one more line.
Father, you came out directly
after the shower.
You didn't even change.
Yes, or else I would have forgotten.
You have come here to check
the water in the tank.
But you are hiding and
smoking the cigarette.
Awhile ago you were telling
that you don't smoke?
Before the children...
I used to hide from
the father and smoke.
I have the same respect
for the children.
The heart and the body...
Feels like dried.
What happened to you, Mr. Ramesh?
Why are you tense?
The things which I thought
will never forget in life...
...it seems like it has
vanished from life.
The doubts that create agony.
You are tensed since Mannu
reached class 12th.
The wind is blowing, my love
Central
When the wind is blowing, my love
I feel pleased thinking
about your love
Your honey-like eyes-
Your eyes shine like the moon.
The wind is blowing, my love
Central
Your gold-like body is mine
till I am in this world
Your heart will rule over me
and will stop my mind from wavering
Your heart will rule over me...
The wind is blowing, my love
Central
And you didn't let it know to anyone.
What are you saying?
Even after 3-4 weeks, you have not
prepared the reports and the file.
You are trying to be funny?
I strongly doubt that he might
have given to the press.
Then he will know the result.
I don't raise the hand
to shout the slogans.
I have come here after seeing
lots of people like him.
Within 24 hours the file
should be on my table.
Sir, you don't know him?
He is Mr. Marthan.
Hello.
- Hello.
I told him, he is into construction
in Muscat...
Everyone knows me by Muscat Marthan.
- I know.
All right then. - Sit, sit, I am coming to
Muscat next week.
Don't be angry for what
minister has said.
This is his way of expressing love.
Sir, don't misunderstand us.
We are in a hurry because
we want to put the stone.
You may put stones or mangoes!
What should I do?
