The Girl on the Train
Subtitle by Bambula
My husband used to tell me I
have an overactive imagination.
I can’t help it.
I mean, haven’t you
ever been on a train
and wondered about the lives of
the people who live near the tracks?
The lives you’ve never lived.
These are things I want to know.
Twice a day I sit in the third
car from the front
where I have the perfect
view into my favorite house:
Number 15 Beckett Road...
I don’t know when exactly.
I suppose I started
noticing her about a year ago
and, gradually, as
the months went past,
she became important to me...
I’m not the girl I used to be.
I think people can see it on my face.
She’s what I lost.
She’s everything I want to be...
I imagine she’s a painter...
She’s creative.
He’s a doctor or an architect.
He has a good laugh.
She can’t cook.
I wonder what they say to each
other before they go to sleep.
Today her name is “Jess, ” tomorrow
it could be “Lisa” or “Amber.”
It all depends on the
day, it depends on my mood.
The truth is, I don’t know her name.
I don’t know if she paints or
whether he has a good laugh.
I just know they know love...
Sometimes I catch
myself trying to remember
the last time I had meaningful
contact with another person...
I used to live two doors
down... number 13 Beckett Road.
It was my first home.
We bought it together. It was ours.
Every day, I tell myself not to
look.
But then I look...
Are you alone?
-Yeah.
No, come. It’s all yours.
Your baby’s so cute.
-Thank you. -Hi, baby.
Is it... Is it a boy?
-Yeah.
So sweet. How... how old is he?
-Six months. -Six months.
So sweet.
A teacher once told me I was a
mistress of self-reinvention...
I wasn’t really sure
what it meant at the time.
But since moving here I’ve
come to understand it...
6 MONTHS AGO
Ardsley-on-Hudson is
boring and routine.
It’s a fucking baby factory.
I want to start my life over again.
So far, I’ve been:
rebellious teenager,
lover,
waitress...
gallery director,
nanny,
and a whore.
And not necessarily in that order.
I can’t just be a wife anymore.
That’s why I stay awake at night,
staring at the ceiling.
In fact, the only time I feel
like myself is when I’m running.
You always felt that way?
Maybe since I was about seventeen.
With Mac.
Mac? Who’s Mac?
My brother’s best friend.
My brother who died...
I tend to smile when I’m nervous.
Sometimes, I laugh.
For a year, Mac and I
lived in this hunting cabin.
We started fucking.
We were the saddest people we knew.
But in a way, that
cabin made us happy.
No one could find us.
Everyone thought we were dead.
And if you were to run away today,
right now, where would you go?
I read once that when a train hits, it
can rip the clothes right off of you.
I’m pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny
job is gonna make me less restless,
make me wanna get pregnant...
And that’s not the case?
When I finish work,
every night I run home,
and I get in the shower and wash the
smell of that baby off me as fast as I can.
ANNA
TODAY
When you woke up this morning I went
and I brought you back to bed with me.
And when I was feeding you, we heard
daddy singing from the kitchen, didn’t we?
“Happy Birthday to you,
Happy Birthday to you,
Happy Birthday dear Anna,
Happy Birthday to you!”
Daddy came upstairs with
a beautiful breakfast
that he made for Mommy,
didn’t he?
Yes he did.
Thank you, Megan.
There you go.
Oh, hello.
I swear I sometimes feel like
my heart is gonna explode.
I mean, look at her.
Look at her!
You’re not sleeping!
Hello? -You’re not sleeping...
Hello?
Hello?
Is that another hang-up?
And grab the corners.
And straighten.
-I got another job.
You what?
I’m really sorry, Anna.
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here...
I am.
It’s just this isn’t what I “do.”
Take care of children?
Or laundry.
Another gallery head-hunted me.
That's great.
-The thing is, it starts tomorrow.
I’m out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.
I hate to leave you like this, without
childcare, but, you don’t have a job.
Ok, that sounded wrong.
I know that you’re busy volunteering.
-It’s not the volunteering.
It’s all the shopping, it’s spending
hours in the farmer’s market,
it’s finding the right foods for
her, it’s pureeing sweet potatoes.
And I do all of this at the
same time as I’m nursing.
Maybe you should go back to work, too.
Mothers need to work, it’s actually
better for the kid. -How would you know?
Your key.
There is no job more important
than raising a child...
Megan, please...
Rachel? What are you doing?
Give me my baby.
Rachel, what are you doing?!
Hello?
Thank you.
Beautiful.
How many times has
she texted you today?
I don’t know. -She called
the landline three times.
You have to talk to her.
-I know.
It’s getting crazy.
-I will. I know I know I know. -Okay.
It’s going to be fine.
Isn’t it always fine? Don’t
I always make everything fine?
Who gives a shit? It’s your birthday. You sure
you don’t want me to take you out tonight?
No, I like it at home.
-Call Megan. Ask her to come back.
She just quit.
She what?
-She just told me she got another job.
Shame. I thought you guys were
kind of a good team together.
So did I.
RACHEL
Hey, it’s Tom. Sorry I missed you.
Hey, Tom, it's me. I just wanted
to wish Momma happy birthday.
Happy birthday, Momma.
-Rachel!
Jesus...
No no no. No, don’t, Cathy. Please
stop it! -Relax. -Cathy, come on! -Relax.
I just need something to go to
sleep. I just need a little bit to go to sleep.
What brought this on?
He posted another picture of the baby.
It was a cute picture.
-Yeah?
Facebook and drunk ex-wives
do not make good friends.
I got it. I got it.
-Alright. I’ll just get you to your room.
Rachel, you have to stop calling
them. Okay?
I really appreciate this room. I do.
I thought that I would just be
here for a couple of weeks or a month.
Yeah. That was two years ago.
Get some sleep.
IVF rarely works the first time.
Would you like a moment?
It’s okay, sweetie.
We’re gonna try again.
We can’t afford to do it again.
When we can, we will.
I wonder what she’s looking at...
Or if she even sees this train at all.
Who is that man?
What is she doing?
She’s throwing it all away.
Anna, I fell asleep last night
thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing the inside
of your thighs. Holding your breasts.
God, I wish I was
fucking you right now.
Anna, I love you. I love you so much.
When it happened to me, I found
dozens of emails.
Tom told her that
he’d never felt like this before.
He said it wouldn’t be that much
longer until they were together.
I know what they say: “You
shouldn’t check his email.”
I was stupid.
But when I saw it was from the realtor
I thought that it was
just spam.
And then I realized that
they were kisses not Xs
and my husband was
fucking a Century 21 Agent.
That sucks. -It does. Her name was Anna Boyd
and he was in love with her.
Come here for one second.
Say "fuck you, Anna Boyd",
but just yell it. -Right.
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
That bitch is living in my house.
I picked everything in that
house. I picked everything.
I picked the
dining table, the kitchen table.
I wonder if she knows that
I fucked Tom
on the same table
that her baby eats at.
I just want to tell her.
I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.
I fucking
picked everything in that house!
I could never find the words to
describe how I felt
when I read that e-mail,
but this morning, I did.
I did.
When I saw that woman
kissing someone else...
I... Betraying her
husband, I felt...
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.
Like something has been
taken from me again.
If I could... If I
could, I’d just go to her house.
And I’d go in and find her sitting
at the kitchen table.
I’d wrap my hand in her long
blonde hair and jerk her head back.
Just jerk it back!
And then I’d pull
her down to the ground
and I would just smash her
head all over the floor!
Move! Get out of my way! Move!
You whore!
Jesus Christ, Rachel! What
the hell is wrong with you?
I’ve spent the past hour
driving around looking for you!
You scared the shit out of
Anna, do you know that?
She thought you were going to...
She wanted to call the police.
So just...
Leave us alone!
You can ruin your own life if you want
to, but you’re not gonna destroy ours.
I’m not gonna protect you any more.
Oh my god...
Rachel, open the door.
Cathy, I just need a sec.
-Are you ok? Rachel, open the door.
I have a stomach flu, okay? -You don’t
have a flu. What the fuck, Rachel?
I’m not stupid...
Rachel!
-Cathy, just go away!
Come here for one second.
Say "fuck you, Anna Boyd."
-Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
You whore!
Anyone counting days one to ninety
who would like to share a day count?
Hey, I’m Jason, I’m an alcoholic.
Welcome, Jason.
-I’ve got twenty-two days back.
Anyone else?
Hi, I’m Rachel, and...
-Welcome, Rachel.
This is day one, I suppose.
I’m here because I...
Because I...
Because I woke up
covered in blood.
And I had bruises
all over my arm and...
It’s usually from when I’ve fallen
and someone has helped me up.
My husband...
He used to tell me what
I’d done the night before.
And I learned that when you wake up
like that, you just say you're sorry.
You just say you’re
sorry for what you did
and you're sorry for who you are
and you're never gonna do it again.
But you do. You do it again.
And there's... time missing.
I need to remember.
I need to remember.
Okay. Thank you, Rachel.
It was that homeless thing. I
don’t remember what it was called.
Oh, Safe Shelter... -Yeah. -That was
a tube top, right? -Yeah, it was.
Do you like Devil’s Eggs, Martha?
-Deviled Eggs? Yeah, I do.
Deviled Eggs.
The classics.
Do you want to try one, anybody? -Those go
outside. I don’t want the eggs with the dessert.
It doesn’t fucking matter where they go,
okay? So do you want to put them here?
Do you want them with your hot dogs? Or you
can put a couple with your quinoa if you want.
Or do you want to put them with your other
salad and your corn, and a couple on the wall!
Rachel!
-I’m fine, Tom. Stop it!
You didn’t back me up.
You never have my back.
You never have my back.
-That’s my boss’s wife.
You probably got me fired back there.
-I don’t give a fuck. I’m your wife.
I’m your wife and you never...
-Rachel! -You never fucking support me!
Please stop. Hey, come on.
I need you to focus here.
Don’t fucking talk to me like that!
-Relax!
Rachel, there you are. -Cathy, I’m sorry.
I need to get my shit together. I’m...
You must be Miss Watson.
I’m Detective Riley.
This is Detective Gaskill. We
need to ask you a few questions.
What’s this about?
-Want to sit down?
Can you tell me where you were
Friday night?
I was at work in the city. And then...
And then I went to visit my husband.
-You mean your EX-husband?
Yes. So I got off the train at
Ardsley-on-Hudson. And then...
And then I decided
that it was a bad idea.
Around what time did you
reach that conclusion?
I was back here by 11:00.
Yeah. Yeah.
On your way back here,
did you stop anywhere?
No. -And what time did
you take the train there?
Um, 6:00.
-So...
What did you do during those hours in
Ardsley if you weren’t seeing your ex-husband?
Do you remember seeing this woman?
She worked for your ex-husband.
She’s gone missing.
-What do you mean she’s missing?
Her husband said she never
came back home the same night
you got off the train
in Ardsley-on-Hudson.
I was just...I was... -Do you know
Megan Hipwell? -No. -Did you see her?
No. I don’t think so. -Is that
because you were inebriated?
Just to clarify, you said
you were at work Friday?
Are you referring to your job
in Public Relations?
Right. -It’s my understanding you were
fired from that job over a year ago
because of your drinking problem?
Ok. That’s enough for now.
If you’re able to remember
anything else, give us a call.
Did you really get fired?
Look, I didn’t want you to worry
that I couldn’t pay the rent...
If you don’t have a job, then
what do you do everyday? -I...
I ride the train.
-You what?
I ride the train to New York and back.
That’s what your alimony’s
paying for? Tickets to nowhere?
That's really fucking
weird, Rachel! -Okay. Okay.
I got on the train.
And then, I got off the train.
I don’t know! It’s very unclear...
You don’t remember anything, do you?
You know, I read about this man
in Long Island who blacked out.
He left a bar and drove to the house
that he’d grown up in,
stabbed its occupants to death.
He woke up the next morning
oblivious to what he did
until the police came to get him.
Rachel! -What? What?
You have to leave. I can’t do this anymore.
I’ll give you a few weeks. -Hold on.
Hold on.
Detective Riley! -Yeah, I agree
with you, but... -Detective Riley!
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell,
but not on Friday night.
She was having an affair. She had a
lover. That’s what I’m trying to tell you.
I thought you didn’t know her.
No. But I saw her.
-You saw her where?
I saw her from the train. She was
standing on the deck with this man.
With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
-No. It wasn’t him.
This man was different.
And they were kissing.
Wow. That’s pretty
coincidental, isn’t it?
You just happen to be on a train at the same
exact moment that a woman you don’t know,
but somehow recognize, is
cheating on her husband?
I know it sounds crazy, but...
-Neighbors saw a drunk woman
in the vicinity of
her house Friday night.
Megan Hipwell does bear a
resemblance to Anna Watson.
Mrs. Watson reported that you go
to their house sometimes uninvited.
And that on one occasion, you
actually broke in and took their child.
Let me give you some advice.
Don’t go back to Beckett Road.
Don’t contact your ex-husband.
Don’t go anywhere near Anna Watson or
her baby. Are you listening to me? -Yes.
You don’t live there anymore.
Stay away.
You know, I lie all the time.
4 MONTHS AGO
I lie to Scott. I lie to you.
I mean I know that’s not
the point of therapy, but...
I have to keep things vague.
Jumble up all the men,
the Exes, the lovers.
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.
Lying is like taking a trip.
It’s like having a secret.
It’s like touching yourself
and no one else knows...
Except you.
But you’re just pretending.
You’re just pretending
to touch yourself.
Scott’s possessive. Jealous.
He likes to own me.
He figures out all my passwords.
Which is kinda sexy.
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop wondering why...
Scott’s behavior is not normal.
It’s a form of emotional abuse.
Are you ever afraid of Scott?
It’s not abuse.
Not if you don’t care. And I don’t.
Maybe it’s become a
normal state for you.
Is it normal I think
about you all the time?
Almost exactly a week ago, Megan Hipwell
walked out of Number 15 Beckett Road
and disappeared. No one has seen her
since. Neither her phone nor her bank cards
have been used since Friday.
Ardsley Woman Still Missing
A wonderful woman. An intensely
private person with a warm heart.
She lost a brother
when she was sixteen,
and both her parents
died a few years ago.
Scott Hipwell urges anyone with
information to please come forward.
You’re Megan’s friend?
-Yes. Rachel.
Come in.
Do you want a coffee?
-Sure. Thank you.
Sorry it’s a mess.
I’ve been hunting for her
social, birth certificate.
The cops need a lot.
Have we met somewhere before?
-I don’t think so.
And you know Megan from?
-From the gallery.
Are you an artist?
-Well, I like to think so.
So you said on the phone, you wanted
to tell me something about Megan.
What did you want to tell me?
I saw your wife with someone,
on Friday morning. -With who?
She was up there on your porch.
I saw her from the train because
I commute to Manhattan everyday
and I go straight past here.
She kissed him.
They were kissing.
I’m sorry. I know this is
a terrible thing to hear.
I know how it feels.
What did he look like?
He was average height.
He had dark hair.
And they were out there on the porch?
Yes.
Fuck.
Fuck.
No, no, no. Thank you.
OK. Sure.
It could, I don’t know.
Maybe it’s a good thing?
It could mean she’s all right.
She just ran off with someone.
-Right.
She talked to you?
-Oh no. I haven’t heard anything.
You know her well enough
to know where we live.
Megan doesn’t have many friends.
Well, I used to live nearby...
She and I, we took yoga...
We took pilates together.
I think I should go, I feel like
I’ve taken up too much of your time.
So sorry to have
had to tell you that in that way.
Do you think you’d recognize him
again? If you saw him?
I don’t know.
There was a guy, a therapist.
His name’s Abdic. Abdic.
Kamal Abdic.
Is that who you saw?
I don’t know. I really can’t tell.
She spends a lot of
fucking time with her shrink.
I remember...
That’s him.
I remember.
That’s him.
I’m sorry.
Where are you? Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stay away from me.
This is so stupid. He makes every
conversation about getting pregnant.
And every time we go there...
-Where?
To that subject.
What subject?
Megan.
What subject?
It's okay.
Megan.
Megan.
All right, Megan.
We shouldn’t...
No.
Megan.
Don’t make it impossible
for us to work together.
Megan, I could lose my practice.
I don’t give a fuck. I don’t give a
fuck about your fucking practice!
I don’t give a fuck...
Dr. Kamal Abdic has been brought in
for questioning on the disappearance
of Ardsley-on-Hudson
resident, Megan Hipwell.
He was, according to sources,
Mrs. Hipwell’s psychiatrist...
For the first time in ages I have
purpose.
Or at least, I have a distraction...
I want Megan to show
up safe and sound. I do.
SCOTT: We need to meet ASAP
Just not quite yet.
Hi.
What’s wrong?
-Abdic’s been released.
What?!
There wasn’t enough evidence.
And because I’m the one that got
him arrested, he talked. A lot.
They’ll build a case against him,
it’ll just take some time.
Are you totally sure he’s the guy
you saw Megan with? -Yes.
You sure as fuck better be.
I don’t understand. -The police
think I did it. -Yeah, but he’s the one...
He told them Megan’s miserable, that
I’m a jealous, controlling husband.
I’m sure that they’re just
trying to rule you out...
Abdic told them I’m abusive.
When she walked out,
I didn't go after her.
I never called to check on her.
I went to a sports bar, for
fuck’s sake, and got drunk. -No.
We just need to find more
evidence on Abdic.
I’ve spent the whole day
going through her stuff.
There’s no emails, there’s nothing,
no letters, no emails. Nothing.
For a second, I thought about
contacting Abdic myself...
Fucking phone won’t stop!
This is Scott. Yeah. Hold on. Hold on.
Do you mind?
You’re heavy. You’re a fatty.
You’re a little fatty.
Rachel? No.
Anna, get in the house.
Your wife hit me on Friday night!
What are you talking about?
-Yes. Yes, she did. Yes, you did.
And then she got in your car.
No. She said you yelled at her that
night. -No. That is not what happened!
She was in the tunnel. And she hit me.
I won’t argue in the street. The
middle of the day and you’re drunk.
I’m not drunk, Tom!
My wife is scared of you.
Of what?
I don’t even know if that’s a joke or
not. Let’s start with child abduction.
That’s bullshit. You know
that’s not... how it happened.
You and I both know what you’re
capable of.
You were just at Scott Hipwell’s
house?
Why are you at Scott Hipwell’s
house?! -Because I’m helping him. -How?
To try and find Megan.
-You don't even know Megan!
Rach. I don’t think
you’re helping anybody.
So you’re here because you
want to uncover lost memories.
Is that correct?
-You have an accent.
Pardon? -Sorry. I wasn’t
expecting you to have an accent.
Well, you have an accent.
Where are you from?
-I’m an American citizen.
But I guess you’re not here to
talk about me.
Unless, you are...
-No. I’m sorry.
I was just trying
to make conversation.
The blackouts. You’re
experiencing blackouts.
Do you want to tell me about them?
Well, when I wake up, and when
someone tells me what I’ve done,
it just doesn’t feel like me or like
something that I would do.
I feel bad about it.
But it’s like it’s so far
removed that I have a...
I just don’t feel bad enough.
You want to take personal
responsibility for what you’ve done,
but you find it difficult to feel accountable
because you can’t even remember it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
-So, Rachel, besides drinking...
Because you clearly drink.
You’ve been drinking
today, haven’t you?
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to draw. Art, I guess.
Good. We can try to regain some of
your memories by drawing them.
I’ve tried it. It doesn’t work.
Have you ever tracked all the way back
to when you started drinking heavily?
When was that?
It was with Tom. When
I couldn’t get pregnant.
Who’s Tom?
He’s my ex-husband.
Do you want to talk about that?
I really wanted a baby.
We tried everything
and nothing worked.
And it just absolutely...
It just broke my heart.
So I got really sad and then...
The booze just broke us.
Okay.
Tell me more.
I used to watch this perfect couple.
And they were just the
embodiment of true love.
It’s like the kind of
love you always want.
And then, she betrayed him.
And it’s sparked something in me...
Why are you really here, Rachel?
Because I’m afraid of myself.
July 5th: 1:33, 1:34, 1:37...
She calls again 1:38 and then she
calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 PM.
And then July 6th...
You get the point.
She sometimes texted him
dozens of times a day.
But these are all from an unknown
number. -Unknown is Rachel.
You have a log of the calls.
You don’t have a log of what
they’re saying to each other.
Look, has she been back to the house
since the incident with your child?
Not that I know. -Well, then you might have
a case for harassment in the second degree,
but these are texts,
they’re not threats, so...
She’s been hanging around Scott
Hipwell’s house. A lot.
I’m aware. There are a lot of loose
ends here that suggest something,
but they don’t add up to much.
If you can bring me
something more solid...
What more do you need?
Evidence. Real evidence?
You sure your husband doesn’t want
to stay in touch with his ex-wife?
What? No. She’s harassing us.
Is that what he calls it?

Hi.
Hi. -Reporters are in my yard.
Everywhere. I didn’t know where else to go.
Come in.
The detective just...
The detective just told me something
I’ve wanted to hear for a long time.
She’s pregnant.
She told her shrink but not me.
I wanted a family,
but she fought me
every step of the way.
We always fought about it.
Did Megan ever say anything
about me to you?
She loved you.
She loved you in ways that
people only dream of being loved.
1 MONTH AGO
You shouldn’t be here.
I just...
I need to tell someone,
just once.
Just say it out loud.
I want to tell you.
And then I’ll be gone, I swear.
I got pregnant.
I was seventeen.
I had her by myself.
She had dark eyes and blond hair.
I expected it to be
hard, but it wasn’t.
It was easy.
Because I loved her.
I loved her.
I called her Elizabeth.
Libby.
Libby.
It was December.
We’d gotten in a fight, me and Mac.
He’d gone off and left.
The roof was leaking.
I was freezing cold,
so I got in the tub.
I brought Libby in with me,
put her on my chest,
her head just under my chin.
I fell asleep.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I let her go.
I couldn’t look.
I didn’t want to see it.
I didn’t want to see her.
I wrapped her in a blanket.
And I buried her.
Then...
Mac went out that night.
And he never came back.
He never came back.
I missed our home.
So one day when I was
drunk, I decided to go there.
The front door was open. It’s not
like I broke in.
And then I heard Evie.
Who’s Evie?
Tom’s baby.
I know this sounds insane,
but I just wanted to hold her.
Just for a moment.
Rachel? What are you doing?!
What are you doing?
Rachel...
I wasn’t going to hurt her.
I would never hurt her.
I just wanted to hold her.
Partially decomposed body
found... Female body found...
Death a result of blunt force trauma.
Partially decomposed body.
Megan Hipwell. Investigation
now being called a homicide.
Sources say the partially
decomposed body found
is missing Ardsley woman Megan Hipwell.
Death a result of blunt force trauma.
Megan Hipwell’s investigation
now being called a homicide.
Mr. Hipwell?
What’s wrong?
I’m sorry.
This reminds me of
when I used to watch
you getting dressed
before going back to her.
Back to this house.
I actually miss being the other woman.
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
-Seriously?
Can we not fixate on her?!
I saw her again today.
-Where?
This afternoon when the police brought
Scott back home. She was across the street.
And when she saw me
she got aggressive.
Aggressive how?
What if Rachel killed Megan?
Rachel did not kill Megan
Then why is she creeping around Scott’s
house? She’s dangerous and you know it.
Anna, sweetheart,
Rachel is a sad person.
She’s completely harmless.
What are you doing
here? How did you get in?
Come here.
Have a beer with me.
I’m not drinking right now.
Detective Riley came
to see me last night.
It turns out I’m not the father.
Neither is the shrink.
Did my wife confide in
you about a third man?
Sit down.
Sit down!
Look, I don’t know what
this is about... -Come on!
You and Megan were such good friends.
You must have known.
Admit it.
-Admit what?
Admit that you never
even fucking met my wife!
The Detective said you
didn’t even know Megan.
She used other words too.
Alcoholic. Maybe even
mentally unstable?
I am sorry. I was honestly
just trying to help.
You’re Tom’s crazy ex!
When the fuck were you
going to tell me that?
And now the detective is asking if
you and I are in a relationship?!
You?! I would never even
get near someone like you!
My wife is dead, and
you’re lying to me!?
What’s wrong with you?
Who does this? -I needed to
tell you about Megan’s affair,
and you wouldn’t have believed
me if I was just Tom’s ex!
Well, thank you, you know. For
getting Abdic to point the finger at me!
For getting the cops to say
that you and I are fucking!
How are they going, huh?
You know? The sessions?
With the doctor?
I wanted to know about Abdic
and I went to him to help you.
You’re just a sad liar with no life.
You’re all liars.
-Please, dont!
I need to file a statement.
-Name? -Rachel Watson. -Pete?
I got this.
You wanted to file a
statement? I’m listening.
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.
You mean your new
boyfriend Scott Hipwell?
No. We were just friends.
But that’s what you wanted, isn’t it? I mean, you
got him to stay overnight at your apartment, right?
You need the context.
-I know the context.
But what I’m trying to determine is when
your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.
Was it before or after his pregnant
wife was murdered?
I mean, you were
neighbors at one point?
I met him after...
-After being questioned by me,
you befriend another even more
obvious suspect than yourself,
and then you manage to get him to incriminate
himself all the while hoping he’ll fuck you.
I came here trying to help you.
He just assaulted me in my own house!
You were seen in the area that night.
There are several hours that
you say you can’t account for.
It was Scott. Scott
Hipwell killed his wife.
No. He didn’t.
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts
for Mr. Hipwell’s whereabouts that night.
You’re lying. You’re lying.
Tell me what happened.
It’s okay.
Tell me.
I don’t know...
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?
LAST FRIDAY
Hi.
I need to see you.
Can you
please come over?
I can still see her dark eyes.
I can smell her skin.
I can feel how cold she was.
Forgive yourself.
You don’t have to be
afraid of being alone.
You’re not alone.
You’ll be fine.
You and your baby will be fine.
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?
I could ask you the same question.
I saw you.
I saw you that night in
the tunnel. I saw you there.
I know I saw you there!
-Lady, I live here.
I’m always in that tunnel.
But what did you see?
What happened
that night? What did you see?
You busted your ass. You fell. I
felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off.
So, I fucked off. -Was I
with anyone? Was I alone?
What happened?!
-I don't know.
You were wasted.
You’re always wasted.
That’s all I can tell you.
Whoa. Take it easy. -I need you
to tell me the fucking truth.
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?
I don't know.
I’m assuming it’s the worst.
God...
Come here for one
second. Just one second.
Say “Fuck you, Anna Boyd.”
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
I wonder if she knows
that I fucked Tom.
When I saw that woman
kissing someone else,
betraying her husband. I felt it.
Pure rage.
If I could, I’d go to her house,
find her sitting...
and I’d smash her head
all over the floor!!
Cathy, thank you for
all you have done for me.
I’m sorry to leave this way.
I’ll send for my things later.
Love, Rachel.
It’s so true. It’s the
worst restaurant ever.
Why do we keep going back?
Martha?
Martha?
Rachel?
I haven’t seen you
in a million years...
Yeah, I wanted to call you, but Tom
said I should just leave it alone.
I'm so sorry.
For what?
For the barbecue.
I just need you to know that I don't remember
anything and I just completely blacked out...
Everyone had a little too much to
drink, so... It’s okay. -I know,
but with the eggs... And
then I screamed at you.
That I was that abusive. I just
feel... I just feel so ashamed about it.
I don't...
Tom... Tom said that I
smashed your plate. I don’t...
Tom was fired
because of how I behaved.
You felt sick and you took a nap in
our guest bedroom.
Do you want to lie down? Come with
me.
Excuse us...
Rachel? Are you feeling better?
You guys can stay the night if you
want. -No, no. That’s fine. Thanks.
I think I’d remember
if you caused a scene...
I’m so sorry.
Get up.
And then Tom took you home.
I’m sorry, Tom...
-Stop fucking saying that!
I know you’re sorry. -I’m sorry.
-What’s your fucking problem?
You can’t even focus on me.
You can’t even fucking stand up.
What is wrong with you? Can you stand?
Fucking disgusting.
No... No...
Yeah. Tom got fired because he
couldn’t keep his dick in his pants.
You did nothing wrong.
Fuck up, Rachel!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake up!
You can sleep out here.
We all felt so bad for you.
Such a bad guy.
God.
Are you okay?
The password is incorrect.
Try again.
The password is incorrect.
Try again.
I need to see you.
Meet me at 3.
I’m here, where are you?
I can't.
Stuck watching Evie.
What are you doing up?
Picking up after Evie.
You whore!
Leave us alone.

Hi, it’s Megan. Leave a message.
You okay?
I thought I heard something.
You should wake me up if you
heard something. -I just...
Come back to bed.
Whore!
Rachel’s down there.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, get the fuck out of
here. Get the fuck out of here!
You’re okay. You just need some help. -Don’t
touch me. Don’t touch me. Just fuck off.
Fuck off!
Come here.
-Anna.
No, no. -Anna, please.
-Go away.
Go. -I’m just going to stand right
here. I’m not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you. -I don’t
want to hear anything you have to say.
Where’s Tom?
He’s lying to you. He always does. He’s
a good liar. -I know he’s a good liar.
We went behind your back for months.
He’s just done it to you...
-I know he’s cheating.
I know.
Anna... He killed Megan.
-No, we don’t... We don’t know that.
He’s dangerous.
-We don’t know anything!
Anna, you need to leave. -No. -You
need to leave. You need to take Evie
and you need to leave.
-No. -Get out of here. -I’m not leaving him.
It’s hardly the first
time he’s had an affair.
It’s not about the affair.
And you know that, deep down.
Anna, please just come with me.
-I’m not leaving him.
Please come with me.
Anna, dont. Dont! Please.
-Come in the house, honey.
I saw you, Tom. You motherfucker, I
saw you! You murderer!
You fucking murderer! You killed her!
You fucking killed her, I know it!
You’re un-fucking-believable.
Now listen. Listen to me. Megan got
into his car that night.
You think I don’t remember. You
thought I blacked out. I saw you.
Why did Megan get in your car? Did
Megan get in your car? -No! -Yes, she did.
Tell her the truth. Just tell
her the truth right now.
You attacked me in that tunnel,
because I saw her with you.
I found Megan’s phone.
I found it.
So, all those phone calls.
They weren’t from Rachel.
So were you fucking her
while she was here, working?
While she was looking
after our daughter?!
You were so tired all the time.
It’s all about Evie.
That’s right.
Tom, give her to me.
-It’s all right.
Tom, give her to me. Please.
Please give her to me.
I think she needs changing. Please? -It’s
gonna be fine. -Please just give her to me.
Let her go. You’re going to hurt her.
-Change her here. Okay, I’ll change her.
Let her go.
You’re gonna hurt her.
911, what’s your...
What’s your emergency?
No no, stay. Stay.
Do you need a drink?
No.
Yeah, you do.
All those things that you said I did.
Those terrible things.
I didn’t do any of them.
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.
You made me think that
everything was my fault.
Drink it.
You told me I got you fired.
But, I didn’t.
You know, I saw Martha
on the train. -Drink it!
I saw Martha on the train. And
she told me that you were fired
because you were fucking
everyone in the office!
Rachel’s down there.
Wait here.
You want to get in the car?
What’s going on?
Don’t worry about it.
Come on.
Okay, I’m here. What is it?
I just want to go to the woods.
What is it with you crazy women?
Is this what you want?
No.
Like this?
What?
-I’m pregnant.
Congratulations.
I thought you should know.
You thought I should know?
There’s a chance it could be yours.
-Then get an abortion.
Or if it’s Scott’s,
do whatever you want.
But if it’s not then... Get rid of it.
You can be as involved as you want.
You’re a shitty nanny. What makes you
think you’re gonna be a good mother?
Why did you bring me
there in the first place?
Because I thought it would be
fun to have you both around.
I played your game
so you could fuck me
in between Evie’s playdates.
-I don’t need another kid.
Certainly not with you. -I took
care of your kid to be near you!
You fucked Anna because you
couldn’t fuck Rachel anymore!
And you fucked me because
you couldn’t fuck Anna!
Take us all away and you’re
just a pathetic, impotent man!
You’re not gonna get rid of me.
You’re gonna pay for this
child for the rest of your life.
You’re like a dog.
Like one of
those unwanted, mistreated dogs.
You can kick them, but they
keep coming back to you.
Thinking that somehow
if they’re good...
You’re not doing this again.
You’ll love them. -This is what
you do. You’re not doing this to me.
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.
If you had just stayed
away that one night...
Just left us all alone.
You brought this on Megan.
In a way, you killed her.
But I didn’t.
You did.
You did this to me in our marriage.
You made me fucking crazy.
Do you have any idea what it’s like
to be married to a fucking blur?
I had no choice. He was...
He would have killed me.
I never wanted to hurt him.
It was self-defense.
She had no choice.
Tom would have killed her.
I saw the whole thing.
Rachel was right about Megan.
She was right about everything.
We are tied forever
now, the three of us.
Bound forever by the story we
share.
Today, I sit in a different car.
And I look ahead.
Anything is possible.
Because I am not the
girl I used to be.
