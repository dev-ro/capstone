Children' what are you doing?
Grandpa' this is my palace."
I am the king of this palace.
Radha is the queen of this palace.
All right. That is fine.
And where am I in your palace?
You too are here.
You are the minister.
"I'm the minister' you're
the king and Radha' the queen."
"Your Royal Highnesses'
please come for dinner."
"No' let Mummy return from the
hospital. Then we'll eat together."
Mummy is home!
Later' kids..."
Father...
What's the matter?
Need something again?
Father' my husband is serious."
The doctor says if he isn't
operated upon immediately..
he won't survive.
What is the point in that
drunk gambler's living?
Save him for now.
Then I'll never ask you for help.
I've helped you so many times.
"Anyway' all that you see
does not belong to me."
It's kept with me in
trust by my late friend.
It's the right of these children.
I can't help you.
- What are you saying?
- That's right.
"Even if I could' I wouldn't
spare a penny for that drunk!"
Your heart has turned to stone.
"Yes' my dear. Seeing you in this
state has made me stone hearted."
All right. Then keep your wealth.
Henceforth we share no relation.
Radha' get up."
"- Prashant' let's go.
- Lakshmi..."
The kids...
- Yes.
- Dev Narain here.
My son-in-law Shekhar
is admitted in your hospital.
Please begin the operation.
I'll be there with the cash.
He passed away a while ago.
""l belong to you"""
Come here.
Are you hungry?
Yes.
Son' you didn't tell us your name."
I don't have a name.
Don't you have parents?
I have nobody.
No' dear. Don't say that."
Henceforth you're not alone.
All of us are with you.
I'll call you Suraj.
Would you like that?
My name... Suraj?
"Yes' dear. Now on
you'll live with us."
""Bathe with ice cold water"""
""Sing even if you are tone deaf"""
You sing so well.
Your voice is so sweet.
Really? But everyone says
I'm stupid and can't sing.
They are mad. You'll see
someday you'll be world famous!
Radha is right.
Someday you'll be a famous singer.
But you'll have to work hard.
"- Will you?
- Yes' I will."
""Bathe with ice cold water"""
""Sing even if you are tone deaf"""
"Mother Goddess' today
Suraj begins a new life."
"For the first time' he's got
a chance to sing on stage."
Bless him.
Help him spread joy
through his voice.
Let fame kiss his feet.
His honour is in your hands.
Mother' bless him.."

Sister...!
Mother is hopping mad.
Don't tell her where I am.
- Prashant! Where is he?
- Run off.
Earlier he'd vanish from the house.
These days he also
makes money disappear.
"Mother' why are you screaming
so early in the morning?"
He stole his own money
not from the neighbours.
Tell me' where he is."
Must have gone to
see an Amitabh film.
He hasn't gone to see any
film. He's right here!
No' mother. I swear by you...on me.."
You're taking a false
promise for that rascal!
No' mother. I.."
Wait. I know how to get him out.
- Mother! - What?
- Nothing.
She's also losing her head.
Mother! I don't mind if you
throw me out of the house!
But you did wrong by
throwing Mr. Amit out!
- I did.
- Yes.
Just you wait.
I'll show you what's right!
- I won's spare you!
- Mother!
You stay out of this!
You've spoilt him by
always supporting him!
He will regret this
once you get married!
That won't happen because I'll
take him along when I get married.
Who wants to live with you?
Both of us will stay with sis.
Wants to stay with his sister!
You'll know when your
husband beats both of you.
"lf he beats me up'
I too will hammer him."
But I won't leave my brother.
I'll keep him close to my heart.
Can't argue with you guys.
You can never change!
Mom...I love you very much.
Do you know why?
Because you gave birth to my sister.
- lsn't that right?
- You're craZy.
I have to remove the spell
from Suraj. You made me forget.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Protecting you from evil.
Do it well.
Protect me too.
Who will cast a spell on you
that I must protect you from?
Help yourself.
Phone again?
A star is bound to get calls.
On the phone all the time!
Fan calls. On the phone all day.
Have breakfast. It's turning cold.
- How is the bread?
- Beautiful.
- And the vegetable?
- Terrific.
Has to be good. I made it.
Your fan following and
singing is thanks to me.
You can't sing without my food.
"- What's the matter?
- Sir' what's wrong?"
- What?
- Too spicy!
What? You were just
praising my cooking.
NO. I was praising my fan.
Who was praising me.
Do you mind?
I can't cook any better.
"lf you want good food'
marry a nice girl."
"Yes' I'm looking out
for a beautiful girl."
Why don't you marry him?
"l said' I'm looking for
a beautiful girl. Beautiful!"
Okay. As if I am
interested in you!
My husband will have a
big moustache! Like this.
Yes' he will have huge moustache."
And he will stammer.
He'll stammer out your name.
Look at him...
No' there's no Suraj here."
- Ask the name..
- He's busy..
What's your name?
- He's busy.
- Give me the phone.
Why don't you speak?
I've cut her off.
Do you know I already feel
sorry for your future husband.
Sir?
- This..
- For me?
It's not for you.
What is it?
I know that it's a letter.
But what is this?
You sent my letter back to me!
Now on' all the letters that come.."
And the sale deeds and tins of
Amul Spray...send them to my house.
I'll drink it mixed in milk at
night and you sing me a lullaby!
Sir' you said lullaby.."
Where is your head?
What do you keep thinking?
- Yes sir?
- Take this and leave.
It's very hot inside.
The air conditioner in
this office doesn't work.
You feel terribly hot.
Why do you display your body?
I've started wearing long
skirts after that day..
I meant the top not the bottom.
I'll have to make you a uniform.
Something with buttons
all the way to the top.
"- Brother' it's me Neeta.
- Yes?"
"All of a sudden' uncle
took a turn for the worse."
He keeps asking for Lakshmi Aunty.
I've sent a message for her.
She must be on her way.
Will father get well?
Will he be all right?
"Don't worry' mother
He'll be all right."
Mother...
"- God' what have you done?
- No' father.."
After so many years my
daughter is coming to see me!
And you snatched her away!
You should have taken me away.
I am coming.
We can't record today.
"No' not even tomorrow.
Or the day after."
I don't know when
And I can't comment
on when we can record.
Please hang up.
Or I'll hang up.
Want to record..
Nobody understands.
At least eat something.
How can I eat?
Radha hasn't eaten for 3 days.
You don't know...
"When I was little' I'd wander
around without food or water."
Radha herself would feed me.
She supported me.
Today she has no support.
"Sir' I know at such a time
one shouldn't' say this."
What?
Why don't you marry her?
I never gave it thought.
I've had dreams for her.
"A handsome husband'
a famous family."
My Radha finds happiness
wherever she goes.
That's a nice dream but
where will you find this husband?
We'll find him.
He will be found.
Uncle Ramu!
See...who has come.
why are you standing out? Come in.
Now all this is yours.
Both of you will stay here with me.
- Prashant and Radha..
- Good day.
- How are you? - Fine.
- And how are you?
Chat later. First get their bags.
In a flash.
Sis...I've only seen such big
houses in Amitabh's films.
"Grandpa' may I go
upstairs to see the house?"
Why just upstairs?
See the whole house.
It's all yours.
Today I have a house' car..."
What do you..?
It's my fault.
I was reciting Amit's
dialogues so we crashed.
"Watching you play' I feel
your youth has returned."
"Not just my youth'
my joys have returned."
I don't follow.
I promised my friend...
I mean Gopal's father
He left both his children with me.
I'd promised my friend
that I'd raise them.
I've kept my word.
Gopal and Neeta can
now look after themselves.
Now I will look after the
children of my daughter.
The love that they were
deprived of as children..
I'll give them that love.
Only one job remains...
Of taking his medication.
That you must not have done.
You've been so unwell and
now you're playing like a kid!
Even you didn't stop him.
In fact you joined him!
Leave the game and go
take your medicines.
The pills and medication..no more.
- What do you mean?
- I'm absolutely fit. Happy
I'm getting you married.
You want me to get married
because you are happy.
- I don't want to get married.
- Why not?
I've even found you a bride!
"You should have asked me'
without asking me..."
- Why do I need to ask you?
- Who is getting married? You or me?
- I don't want to marry..
- Why?
There's a girl in my heart
since I was a kid.
I will only marry her
"Actually as a kid' there's
been a girl in my heart too."
So I'll marry you off to her.
If you like her since childhood
she's as old as you so you marry her.
No. I know her since she was a kid.
- Why are you arguing?
- I'm not arguing. I won't marry!
- You are arguing.
- There's no argument.
"- You are small' obey me..
- I don't want to marry!"
- Uncle tell him...
- Grandpa..
- Why are you telling him?
- Grandpa...
Let him marry the girl in his heart.
You don't interfere...
- Don't force him..
- When did you come?
A while ago.
Forget the small talk. The girl l
chose for you is none other than her.
I said..the girl in my heart...
"Keep quiet. I said'
you are marrying Radha."
Yes but the girl I mentioned..
Don't butt in.
I was telling him I like a girl..
- Why are you asking her?
- All right.
"Once you get married'
I'll go on a pilgrimage."
As you wish.
Coming' grandpa!"
Let go..
Do you know who is
the girl in my heart?
- I don't know.
- How come?
- You should know.
- I don't.
Uncle didn't give me
any time to speak..
- You should know.
- I don't.
And I don't even want
to know about that chump.
You should know about the chimp.
- Why?
- What does that mean?
Have you forgotten everything?
When we were kids..
Under the umbrella..
when it was pouring..
- Can't recall?
- No.
And that little house..
the king and queen game..
Don't you remember anything?
"What are you muttering?
Game of king' under the umbrella.."
All right. Where is she?
- Here.
- That even I know.
But how can I peer into your heart?
You can peep into my bedroom.
Is she in the bedroom?
There's a dressing table
behind my bed. Near it.
- Go and take a look.
- No.
- Grandpa sent me for a job..
- Send grandpa to blaZes!
He created all the confusion.
- Go and take a look.
- I don't want to go.
Our marriage..
We're getting married.
I want you to know everything.
I don't want to see her..
You're forcing me!
Chimp!
Go and take a look!
Reached the bedroom!
Peep into my heart.
Is she pretty?
Must be a chump.
Could she be in the bathroom?
Anybody in?
Seen?
Where? There's nobody here.
Not even a photograph.
I never said there's a photo.
I said near the dressing table.
See for yourself
There's nothing but a brush.
Not the brush.
Come here.
Look at this.
Where?
Look here.
That's me!
It is you.
Me...?
You are lying.
I am not lying.
I never lie.
"Honestly' you are the
only one in my heart."
Yes!
Grandpa is calling me.
Coming!
Am I the one in your heart too?
When will he come?
Wait...
Come on.
All of them are fans of Suraj.
All the girls are craZy about Suraj.
- where is he?
- Upstairs. - Lets go.
Throw away the cigarette.
- Let's go.
- Right.
He's Hansmukh. I mentioned him.
Suraj's secretary.
Suraj...
- what happened to Suraj?
- He had an accident.
Yes. He lost his voice
but by God's grace he's fine.
Where is he?
He's just been discharged from
the hospital. He's resting.
Upstairs...
What happened to you?
How did the accident occur?
Why don't you speak?
Joking!
Making me a fool!
- I won't ever talk to you!
- But why?
- You almost killed me!
- So did you.
You went away to your
grandpa. What about that?
Did you think of what
would happen to Suraj?
Do you know one another?
You may not tell me.
But I have the birth certificate
of the man who will marry Radha.
"where does he live'
what business he runs.."
"What are his likes and dislikes'
what does he eat and drink..."
How much he loves you and you're
getting married on the 21st of July.
I also know that.
Radha is full of praise for you.
- Come in.
- We must leave.
- You must come 2 days early.
- Are you leaving?
We have to distribute lots of
cards. Do come for the wedding.
I'll be there 4 days before.
Else how will Radha get married?
Take care of my Radha.
Don't worry' Suraj."
I'll take good care of your Radha.

Will you answer my question?
Whom do you love the most
in this wide world?
My mother.
One should love mother.
She gives us birth. Raises us
So the mother is the dearest.
"After your mother' whom do
you love the most in the world?"
My brother.
Yes. Do you know why?
He has nobody but me in this world.
I am his mother.
Why do I feel as if
today is Mother's Day?
What?
It would be better if
you didn't ask any more.
- You'll get the same answer.
- What's the matter?
"Mother' then the step mother
then the grandmother..."
Maternal grandmother..
Paternal grandmother...
Who is Hema?
Nobody. You said mother...
- Do you like apples?
- No.
Neither do I like them.
You didn't ask further.
If you had' I'd have said..."
I love you the most.
"From this day' you're
most important to me."
In 5 minutes.
I'll help you.
What happened??
You burnt your finger.
Is it burning a lot?
Is it hurting?
What do I do?
What are you doing?
Just 5 minutes.
What are you doing?
Nobody touches a hot pan.
See' it got burnt."
You act like a child.
Go sit on the dining table.
I'll get the breakfast.
I'll eat right here.
- Sit there.
- Why should I eat there?
I'll sit here and eat
while I watch my wife.
Turn around.
Turn a little..please
Why don't you wear blouses
with net at the back?
I don't like them.
They look nice.
Why do you tie your sari so high?
You can tie it a little lower.
Move away. It doesn't look good.
Of course it does.
Everyone wears them.
Girls who have no waist wear them.
And you have such a lovely waist.
Go and sit there quietly.
Shut your mouth and
eat this hot paratha.
How can I eat with my mouth shut?
Joking?
- Like my joke?
- I'd laugh if it were funny.
Yes Dinesh?
Not tonight.
No way.
"I've just got married.
I'll spend time' talk to my wife."
I'll romance her.
"No' is it more
important than my wife?"
Explain to him' I can't come."
Who said that? Nana?
Take him.
My road will be clear
if you take Nana.
- Sis...
- What is it?
I want some money.
Money...how much?
- Only Rs. 5000.
- 5000?
I want a second hand motor
cycle like the one Amit rides.
- So..
- I don't have that much.
But I'll talk to grandpa..
- Brother-in-law..
- What's up?
Sis will talk to grandpa.
I see...
What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Then do something.
There's a new video on Amitabh.
Right. Sis' grandpa.."
- What grandpa? Go on.
- Okay.
Watch the complete thing.
Don't come back halfway.
- Where are you going?
- To cook for grandpa.
Everyone only talks of grandpa!
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
You start off anywhere.
All day you're in the kitchen
and I'm in the office.
Today I've cancelled all
meetings and come home.
- Come here.
- What..? Grandpa might come..
To blaZes with grand...
What's wrong with Radha?
Nothing. She felt faint.
Faint..?
- Now she's fine.
- Yes.
I got worried. What..?
No...don't worry.
I'll handle everything.
Sis' what happened?"
Nothing is wrong with your sis.
Nothing is wrong.
He'll handle it.
Are you well?
- Go and watch video.
- Come on.
What's wrong with sis...
Why are you giggling?
Come on.
Brother...
It must be here..
"- Did uncle come here?
- Who? Yes' he's gone in."
Okay.
What are you doing?
I'm trying but can't get anywhere.
Nothing. I'm looking for something.
- What are you looking for?
- You want uncle. Go in.
Go in.
I like to see you mad.
I'll first settle the
matter of grandpa.
Did you call?
Yes' please sit here."
I've booked you for
tomorrow morning to Benares.
"You'll go there' visit
the 4 places of worship."
Everything has been arranged.
How?
I have to first see
the faces of my grand kids.
"lf you want to see your
grand kids' you have to go."
You'd taken a pledge.
That has to be fulfilled.
- That can be done here.
- Yes.
No' she knows nothing."
It will be more effective
if you go there and ask.
Don't you always say it?
So will you go tomorrow morning?
- Definite?
- Yes.
Then go and finish packing.
"- Help me' dear.
- All right."
Sent one packing.
Uncle just doesn't understand.
Now if anyone disturbs
one by one..
I'll send everyone packing.
What happened?
Are you talking to yourself?
Nothing. I was spraying perfume.
- Milk.
- Thanks. Wear some.
Packed uncle's bags?
Packed some food too?
Did you check' nothing left?"
All done.
- Sure he'll leave in the morning?
- Yes.
So now nobody will interrupt us.
What are you doing?
I'm thinking of playing
some football with you.
Or let's play volleyball
First switch off the light.
The lights won't be switched off.
Check the phone.
"Whoever it is' tell him
I'm busy. Playing football."
"Not football. Say'
I'm fast asleep."
Not to disturb me.
- Ask them to call in the morning
- Morning?
What are you doing?
What am I doing? Nothing.
Did I disturb you?
- No..didn't disturb.
- Cover up and talk.
- Is there a medicine to stop?
- Stop what?
How...You must have eaten something.
- What did you eat?
- Little gravy at a party.
I ate just once and
went to the loo 15 times!
Why didn't you take some medicine?
"Since you got married' I don't
know what's where in this house!"
So you need me?
Okay. Where are you?
- At home. Where else?
- I know that.
- But where?
- In the hall.
Go up to the bedroom.
What is it? He's got loose motions!
Loose motions
- Tell him to consume Tik 20
- No.. - No?
- He had to call now!
- Have you reached?
I can't walk any faster.
What..?
I'm in bad shape and you're laughing!
That is why I say' eat in limits."
And you jump into the
pot on seeing curry!
But it didn't say..
- What?
- Shall I talk?
Look at your hair.
Not you...reached?
Yes' almost there."
- I'm there.
- See the cupboard?
Yes...one minute!
"- What's up?
- Hold on' I'm coming."
"- Line got cut?
- No' he's gone to the toilet."
Does he go alone?
- Stop joking.
- Wonderful.
- Yes?
- Open the cupboard.
- Opened.
- See the books?
The medicine is behind the books.
Yes' found it."
Take 2 pills.
- Water...
- Drink lots of water.
- Listen...- Switch
off the light? - One minute.
If your condition worsens' call me."
I'll come there with him.
- Don't hesitate.
- Shall we go now?
- Let's go.
- No.
What a pain!
There's nobody to look after him.
Poor Suraj.
Why doesn't he get married?
You tell him.
I will tell him when we meet next.
What game?
Now let me see how he calls!
Son' you appear worried."
- Why?
- Just asked.
You know our neighbour' Shyamlal?"
You know his son' Mahesh well"
The poor man was always
worried after his marriage.
- Why?
- He has a big family.
As a result neither could the
couple talk not be together.
He came to me.
Fell at my feet and begged..
I solved his problem in 2 minutes.
Uncle...
What did you advise him?
Forget about what I said.
- Tell me.
- If you insist.
I told him to take his wife far away.
To another city. Stay
together for 24 hours.
Have a great time.
That ended their problems.
- Really?
- Yes.
They still acknowledge me.
Why are you telling me this?
Do I look like a fool? Go.
What's the matter?
You're looking great today.
Wasn't I looking good yesterday?
Yes but today you're
looking even better.
- Why?
- Because we're going to SwitZerland
That's very far!
That is why we're going.
- No! I won't go.
- Why?
- It's very cold out there.
- So we'll take some woolens.
If I still feel cold?
I am with you.
Will we fly?
I might feel nausea in the plane
So...nothing.
I'll carry lots of lemons.
I'll make you lime juice.
Who will look after
Prashant and Neeta?
I'd forgotten about them.
- We'll take them along
- Really?
- We'll take the neighbours too.
- That will be nice.
Our honeymoon...
You..me. Me and you...
And nobody else between.
Really?
- Forget it.
- It's ringing.
I'll take it. You put this away.
Yes' it's me."
"- I too am me.
- Sir' Suraj here."
Yes Suraj?
- Can I talk with Radha?
- Why? Don't like talking to me?
- How are you?
- Great.
- Ask me why
- Why?
- Because I'm going abroad.
- Where?
- When?
- In 2 days.
Let's go together!
We're also going then!
- What's it?
- Not to you.
Carry woolens. It's very cold there.
And also carry the
sweater I knitted for you.
- Don't forget!
- How can I forget it?
You knitted a sweater for Suraj?
"Listen' Suraj is also
going to SwitZerland."
But..I was thinking
maybe you were right.
- We won't go.
- Why?
You said it will be cold..
But you said we'll carry woolens.
"But it's a long journey and
you say' you'll feel sick."
Yes...but you said
you'll make me lime juice.
- Yes.
- Then we'll go?
But where are you going now?
To buy limes.
"- Get 3..
- Yes' one for Suraj."
Our honeymoon and
Suraj accompanies us.
Spoilsport!
I'll see...
I'd bought a ticket to SwitZerland
but I don't want to go there.
Can you please change it?
But a while ago you were
pressing for SwitZerland.
In fact you were fighting.
"But now I'm saying'
I don't want to go there."
I want to go anywhere else.
Give me tickets to Scotland.
Netherlands?
Not available.
What's this land?
Yes' give me tickets to Thailand."
"why do you keep saying sorry?
I said' any land will do for me."
Except for SwitZerland.
- Talk sense to her.
- Go to the international airport.
They'll solve your problem.
Give me back the ticket.
Did I ask you?
First wear decent clothes
Then give out advice.
Give her a ticket to SwitZerland.
""l am yours' my love"""
""My love' I belong to you"""
""l swear by everything I love"""
""Never shall we part"""
""l am yours' my love"""
""My love' I belong to you"""
""l swear by everything I hold dear"""
""Never shall we part"""
""These beautiful moments.."""
""When we meet"""
"""We won't ever forget
the promises of love"""
"""lt is difficult to
pass the day or the night"""
""I'm restless every moment"""
""Never will our love decrease"""
""l belong to you"""
"""l want you to live in
every heart beat of mine"""
"""l want to hide you from
the world in my eyes"""
"""Every time I open my eyes
I want to see only you"""
""Never should we stay apart"""
"""l swear by everything
that I love so dearly"""
""Never shall we part"""
"- This is Radha's house' right?
- Radha's upstairs."
Upstairs? All right.
Suraj' come on in."
Don't talk to me. I went mad
looking for you in SwitZerland.
Know what? He said something
was wrong with the tickets...
so we didn't go to SwitZerland.
- Where did you go then?
I don't know where we went either.
But whichever place it was...
it was very beautiful.
There were so many flowers...
greenery and cold...
it was great fun.
"l had even telephoned you'
but couldn't get through to you."
You're still a kid.
What have you brought for me.
- For you? Here is it.
This shirt.
I like this even more.
- This? All right.
"l got it for my husband'
but you may keep it."
I'll give him this one.
Want me to wear it?
- Sure.
What are you up to?
What?
What are you doing?
- I'm trying this shirt.
Aren't you ashamed to strip
before another man's wife?
Ill-mannered man!
Don't you dare take off your
shirt before anyone else again!
"Bloody body-builder.
- Yes' I'm a body-builder."
"My body' I take off the shirt.
Take off yours' if you have a body."
"Don't touch me!
She's my wife' this is my bedroom."
I'll do what I please
and you can't!
She's your wife now.
- Was she yours earlier?
"What happened' sir?
- Nothing."
"You were saying ""No""?
- Actually..."
"someone was getting a wrong number
of the mobile' so I said ""no""'
"Don't give your number to anyone'
you'll get a lot of wrong calls."
"Actually' one musn't even give
the residence number to anyone."
He's right.
How was your tour?
And you didn't go to SwitZerland.
What do you think of this shirt?
- Very nice...
Iooks like it was bought for you.
- I wore it for the heck of it
Why're you taking off your shirt?
Don't take it off.
I don't use things people have
already used. That's my policy.
"l have a policy too' sir.
- What?"
My policy is that I use anything
belonging to others.
I know that.
"Tell me something' Suraj.
Why don't you get married?"
"Yes' Suraj. You must tell him.
He keeps asking me all the time."
"Now that the two of you're married'
I think I've got married."
"Whenever I'm hungry'
I come here for a meal."
"When I'm bored' I come here.
When I'm in the need for mischief..."
I come here. And when I need
some kids...
What?
- I'll tell the two of you...
"to have some children'
so I can play with them."
So you want the two of us
to do everything for you?
I'm leaving.
- So soon?
I've got work to do. Lots of it.
And Sir's here anyway.
I don't mind leaving either.
Now what was I saying? What?
- Mischief.
Before that?
- Children?
After that... I remember.
Sir...
Lay off. This is men-talk.
You made me forget it!
- Go on.
Oh yes' I remember."
I'll tell you later.
- Tell me now.
Later...
No greater fun than suspense' sir."
You're still a kid.
Looks good.
I'll go and cook.
The kid...? And the body-builder?
Body-builder...? No.
It's okay.
I won't ask you today what I've been
asking you everyday in three years.
"lt isn't about how you are'
what you ate and drank..."
about when you went to sleep
and woke up. No way.
I'm going to discuss something
very important with you today.
It's that...
the world is making
such great progress.
"ln every department'
progress is the catchword."
"People have a cell-phone in one hand'
and a girlfriend in the other."
But the tragedy about
my life is that...
I'm still where I was
three years ago.
I sure do have a mobile-phone.
But the girlfriend is missing.
You get what I'm saying?
No...? I'll explain.
My life can also make progress
provided you say just one thing.
You must tell me...
that you love me.
"Should you say that' I'll think
where man has reached the moon..."
I've gone far beyond.
I'll wait for 10 seconds then...
for your response.
One.
Two.
I love you too.
I'll give Radha the good news
and call you back.
Let me go there.
The phone's ringing.
"Forget it' Radha. There are people
in the hall' someone will pick it up."
Help me with this tie.
- I don't know how to tie it.
How don't you?
I'll show you.
Very simple.
Put this one on that.
Pull it now.
Stand straight. How'll I tie it?
- That's just the way. Pull it.
What are you doing? Let me go.
- What is it?
But this is the way.
Pull it!
Someone might see us...
- No one will see us.
You start this anywhere.
- I'm with my wife.
But we're in the hall!
- Must I find another one for the hall?
Radha dear... it's a call
from Suraj.
One moment' okay?"
Now look. I have something
very important to tell you.
Not now. He's preparing
to leave for the office.
At what time will your husband
set out for the office?
In another 10 or 15 minutes.
- I'll call you in 10 minutes then.
"No' I'll give you a call
after he has left for the office."
Let me tie it for you.
It's okay. I'm getting
late for the office.
"When you find time from the telephone'
learn to tie this."
What are you doing...?
It's very tight!
He gets angry because I can't
help him with the tie!
"I've done it' sis!
- Why're you yelling?"
"l got a call through to the programme
""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"""
They asked me a question
and I gave them the right answer.
"When I'm on the show' sis'
I'll call you for help."
You must help me with the answer
and we'll make 10 million rupees.
"Let's give your husband some.
Some to Kaka' Nana' Suraj..."
"and lots of it to Neeta.
She spends a lot' right?"
Big deal! You look
like a monkey right now.
What's that on your forehead?
Like you have this tie around
your neck... your husband-style.
No style at all.
He forced it around my neck.
I've been trying to take it off.
But it won't.
"How do you take it off?
- This is a small problem' sis."
"When I win 10 million'
I'll solve all your problems."
But I have a problem right now.
- What problem?
I have nice clothes to wear.
But I have no money.
Your problem will be
solved tomorrow.
Coming' brother-in-law."
Yes?
Why did you need 5000 rupees?
I saw this motorcycle. And so...
- So you took it?
What are you talking about?
I swear' I haven't..."
Now listen. I hate liars
and thieves.
And button up this shirt.
"You're making a mistake' brother-in-law.
I haven't stolen anything."
Please believe me...
I haven't stolen anything.
"But' brother-in-law...
I haven't stolen anything."
What's up? You didn't
hand the glass to me.
Radha... what happened?
How could you call
my brother a thief?
It's nothing of the sort.
Let's sit down and talk it over.
Sit down.
All I told Prashant is that
if he ever needs something...
he must ask me for it.
- No. You called him a thief.
"He must've been so hurt.
- Sit down' Radha."
Don't be silly. Whatever I told him
was in his own welfare.
There has never been
a theft in this house.
"Really? Now that we've arrived'
thefts are taking place?"
Did I say that?
- You've always been insulting him.
And you accuse him of theft today?
What do you think he is?
"We're not vagabonds either.
We have imbibed good values' too."
"lf you don't like him staying here'
just throw him out."
"Enough. That I'm quiet' doesn't mean
you can say anything to me."
Such a thing...
"l was late for college
yesterday' brother."
I had to pay my fees. So I took
5000 rupees from your wallet.
Why didn't you ask me for the money?
You could have asked me for it!
"You ought to have asked me.
Isn't it' Neeta?"
"l told you' my brother is not a thief.
- Enough! Enough!"
Prashant asked you for money
yesterday. Didn't he...?
Did you ask me for it...? Did you?
So what will I think if I find
money missing at home?
And nobody asks me for anything.
What am I anyway...?
What am I in this house?
- No...
No! You and your brother are right!
We're the ones who make mistakes!
I didn't say anything of the sort.
What are you doing...?
- I'm sorry... okay?
I said I'm sorry' didn't l?"
"You shouldn't have taken money from
my wallet' without asking me for it."
It's wrong.
See what problems it has caused?
"I'd never mind it' no matter
how much you hit me."
What I feel sad about is that you
hit me in the presence of your wife.
Where did it hurt you...?
Here?
Here...? Of was it here?
Brother...
- Relax. I've got to go the office.
"Prashant' switch off the TV.
It's time for my husband to return."
Change the bulb in
the bathroom; it has fused.
Neeta' wait..."
"Listen to me' Neeta.
You're making a mistake."
"Wait' Neeta...
- Don't touch me!"
Listen to me...
- Don't talk to me.
I didn't know you'd come
to the bathroom.
"Go away!
- Believe me' Neeta."
I wasn't in the bathroom on purpose.
My sister told me to...
Your sister asked you to
go and watch me bathing?
How can you say such a thing?
Why'd my sister say that?
It's just that...
How was I to know that you'd
suddenly land in that bathroom?
This is my house! And I will
bathe in any bathroom I wish!
And I couldn't even imagine
you'd be such a creep!
"lf I tell my brother'
he'll give you a thrashing."
I didn't watch you bathing. I swear.
"lf my sister gets to know about this'
I won't be able to face her."
Sister... believe me...
"Listen to me' sister...
believe me' I did nothing wrong."
God!
"l swear it on you' sister.
I don't care what they think."
But you mustn't misunderstand me.
And you told me to go there...
"Yes' I did. Could you walk out'
when she went in there?"
You say you didn't see anything.
But who will believe you? Who?
"When she came there' didn't you
have the sense to...?"
How could you do this...?
What can I do about it now?
Open the door' Neeta."
"Gopal...
- What happened' Radha?"
"Why are you crying?
- Nothing has happened' son."
Nothing.
- Is that why she's crying?
What is the matter?
What is it? Why's she crying?
"Nothing has happened.
- One minute' Kaka. I'm talking."
Did you say something to her...?
Will someone tell me what happened?
Brother...
What happened' Neeta?"
I'll explain... please!
- One minute. Enough!
Sister...
"Prashant' your brother-in-law
is terribly angry right now."
You can come back
when he has cooled down.
Sister...
- Don't talk to me.
"Go on' son. Come back later.
Go now."
Neeta is making a mistake...
What the hell have you done?
