Come to your father.
If you've got such a big mouth,

You're right. It's my fault.
Get your paws off me.
[heavy breathing]
Claudia, look, I've got it.
He can't hurt her.
Put it away, it's dangerous.
[dramatic music plays]
Hey. Jack.
You're not right at all.
You're a pathetic drunk bastard.
- I no longer want anything to do with you.
- Ungrateful whore.
Destroy her.
[woman screams]
- No.
- [woman] Stop.
- Ferry.
- Let her go.
[woman] Fer. Put that down, boy.
[Jack] Are you going to shoot
your own father?
Let her go.
[girl] Ferry, come back.
- [Jack] What are you going to do?
- Fer, boy.
And now?
- Jack, stop.
- Shoot then, tough guy.
- [woman] Jack.
- Shoot then.
[woman] Jack.
- If you don't shoot, I will.
- [woman] Stop.
Jack, don't.
Jack. Look at me. Stop.
Never threaten someone
if you can't go through with it.

[sniffing]
Yo.
Hey.
- Ali.
- Baba.
Brink, Ferry.
Hey, hands off.
Tasty.
You could become a real kebab master.
[background chatter]
[man 1] We're missing Koeman.
[doorbell rings]
What are you on about?
He hasn't played in ages.
Well with Koeman,
we'd have been champions.
[man 2] Are you serious?
You should have become a pundit.
- How's it going?
- Just in time, gents, the game's starting.
[Brink] Here. How's it going here?
- I didn't know you were coming.
- Just checking how it's going.
- Well, it's going well.
- Really?
- I heard that the Maroc is gone.
- Yes, it sells really well.
Yes. Didn't I ask you to stock up?
I did and it's gone again.
Let me handle my business
and you handle yours.
I've got it all under control here.
So just back off.
- Dad, come on.
- What do you mean, come on?
Do you know who we just saw?
Etienne, that good friend of yours.
Still hasn't paid, eh?
You're letting yourself get cheated.
It's bad.
- Brink.
- For us all.
Ferry and I took care of it for you,
so just take that as an example.
Otherwise you'll be back
crying for money again.
Dad.
[kickoff whistle]
Go get some beers.
The game is starting. Come on.
[football commentators talking]
[commentator] The match is kicking off.
It's important for Ajax.
[brakes screech]
[engine revs]
[funky music plays]
[football commentators talking]
- Open. Open up now.
- [doorbell rings]
[buzzer sounds]
- Hands on your head.
- Hands up.
No messing around.
- If you move, you're dead.
- Run to the back.
Hands on your head.
Fill up the bag. Now. Hurry up.
[shouting]
[attacker 1] Hey.
[attacker 2] Keep filling it up.
Keep going.
- Now.
- [attacker 1] Hurry up. Come on, man.
Keep going.
[shouting]
Hey, what are you doing? Fucking idiot.
- Do you want to die?
- What's happening?
- What's happening?
- Dad.
Hey, move it.
[attacker 2] Keep filling it up.
[shouting]
- Don't do it.
- Almost done?
Hey, almost done?
- [football commentators talking]
- [gunshot]
[commentator] He's too late. A number
of defenders looking at each other
but Suarez times it so well...
- Who are you?
- Fuck.
[ringing sound]
Goddamn it.
[Brink] Ferry.
This isn't good.
Ferry, this isn't good.
[shouting]
Go get the car.
[car screeching]
- We're nearly there.
- Hold on, boy. Come on, hold on.
[car screeching]
EMERGENCY
- [medic 1] Gunshot wound to the thorax.
- [medic 2] Take him to the operating room.
- Guys, pulse.
- [medic 1] Start.
Here's the operating table.
You can't come any further.
Brakes on. We lift on three.
- One, two, three.
- OK.
- What is the tension?
- Blood pressure is too low.
[running water]
- [heavy breathing]
- [medical equipment beeping]
I wanted to toughen him up as a kid
so he could take better care of himself.
If he got beaten up at school…
…he'd get a few knocks from me too,
to make him stronger.
He was always different.
[sigh]
And I haven't been able to protect him.
I wasn't paying attention.
I should never have let them in.
It's my fault.
[Brink] No. It's not your fault.
They knew where to go. They knew.
They waited for that match.
This is no coincidence, Fer.
Southerners.
They were from the south.
Yeah, they very well could be.
You know that area.
You know people there.
I haven't been there in ages.
That's not for nothing.
I want you to find out who did this.
And I want you to shoot them.
[ominous background music plays]

[attacker] If you move, you're dead.

[dog barks]
- Who is that?
- I don't know.
Go and check.
[ominous background music ends]
Who are you? What are you doing here?
- I've come to visit.
- Visit who?
John and my sister.
I've not seen you before.
Were you in jail?
Only idiots go to jail.
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.
- My father is in jail.
- [man] Wesley.
- I'll puncture your tires, moron.
- [man] Scram.
[birds chirping]
John.
It's been a while.
Did you dye your hair?
- Claudia is inside.
- I came for you.
House X was robbed. They shot Mattijs.
- It's not looking good.
- Shit.
- Can we talk?
- [woman] Why the fuck are you here?
Sister.
I was in the area.
For business.
- I thought I'd stop for a coffee.
- Just one cup.
Well, come inside.
[Claudia] No shoes on my carpet.
Nothing's changed.
Wait, honey.
Yes.
- Honey, can you make some coffee?
- Fine.
Did you fall?
Sort of, yes.
Camp's looking good.
So, what's your news?
- What?
- You don't just drop by.
How long have John and I been married?
About four or five years? So?
[sighs]
- You finally came to say sorry.
- Can we just sit in peace?
No. I can't look at your face
if you don't say sorry.
- Why must I say sorry and not you?
- I don't have time for this.
- John, help me up.
- Claudia…
- Help me the fuck up.
- Fer's just got here.
Let her go and then we'll talk.
No, you know what?
I'm staying here. You get up.
Jesus, the Clau hasn't changed one bit.
- Fuck off, you hairball.
- Just keep quiet for a second.
See him showing off
with his fake blond hair.
- You make me sick.
- Fuck off, hysterical windbag.
Here, this is what I think of you,
ugly baboon.
- Always so difficult.
- Me, difficult?
- Yes.
- Dirty piss stain.
That's mature.
Can't you shut your trap for five seconds?
Drop dead, man.
Sweetheart, calm down.
Stay calm.
Clear off, Fer. Get out. Scram.
[ominous music plays]
Scram.
It's OK, I'm here.
[ominous music ends]
[sighs]
[sniffs]
[car door unlocks]
- Here.
- Yes.
What's going on?
[sighs]
She's sick, Fer.
There's a tumor in her head. A big one.
What?
[John] It causes her
to have severe mood swings.
Tantrums like that. Paralysis in her leg.
They tried to remove it,
but they couldn't.
So?
They give her a couple more months.
Can I go to her?
Leave it. She's resting now.
- What can I do for you?
- Well…
Brink wants me to find those guys.
They were campers. Southerners, I think.
Three men. Two robbers and a driver.
I've been out for a while, Fer.
I promised your sister.
I know, but you've been around
for a while, you might hear something.
I have a photo of one of them.
You may have seen him before.
What?
[John] That's Jason.
John Kant's son, a real bastard.
[Ferry] Where does he live?
[John] He fled to a campsite in Belgium
last year.
[Ferry] Which campsite?
CAMPING ZONNEDAUW
[John] Zonnedauw.
[cheerful acoustic music plays]
[birds chirping]
[car beeps]
[kids playing]
Sorry, I'm looking for Jason Kant.
Jason Kant?
- Do you know Jason Kant?
- No.
- Thank you.
- Jason Kant, boys?
No, we don't know him.
Sorry, do you know Jason Kant?
Yes, I think he lives there
in the chalet with the American flag.
- Over there?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- Sure.

Misha?
Shit.
Misha?
Misha?
[squeaking]
Misha?
Misha?
[gun clicks]
[heavy breathing]
Misha?
[cat meows]
Oh, there you are.
You know you're not allowed outside.
Come here.
You're not allowed to go outside.
No, it's not allowed.
Come here. Give me a kiss.
[kissing noises]
Eat up.
Bye, honey. Bye bye.
[front door closes]
[door squeaks]
Is that good, Misha?
Damn cat.
[birds chirping]
[sighs]
Mom, you know I can't go that fast
with my knees.
[fast breathing]
- Hello.
- Are you doing that on purpose or what?
- Ah, you're Mr…
- Ferry.
Mr. Ferry. Yes.
- Are you the owner?
- Yes, for 20 years now.
I'm Filip.
Nice location.
I know what you're up to, pervert.
Mom, this isn't Eddy. This is a new guy.
Yes, sorry, we had some trouble
with the previous tenant.
They made weird movies here,
but that's all been cleaned up.
But it wasn't nice. It wasn't…
Allez. Give me the key, mom.
Allez. The key.
Hey…
Crazy bitch.
[keys rattling]
Voilà.
Entrez.
Relax, OK? Good.
As you can see, it's not big,
but it has got all the modern comforts.
There's a fridge, a fire,
and if it really gets too hot,
you can rent a fan from us.
How much is it?
Ah.
200 per week.
- Cash?
- What else?
Wow.
OK, thank you.
Oh yes, the supermarket closes in an hour.
And if you want to go outside
to soak up some culture,
the fair is on in the town center.
Yes, I know it's not much,
but it's something, isn't it?
So, I'll put the key here.
That's a good place,
so you don't lose them.
Allez, bye, OK?
Mom, turn around. We're off.
[door closes]
[sighs]
[dial tone sounds]
[Brink]Yes?
Yes, it's me. How's it going?
[Brink] His blood levels are going up,
but I don't know what that means.
- Going up is good, right?
- [Brink] Yeah, sure.
Yes. And you?
Yeah, I found one of the guys
at a campsite in Belgium.
I'm sat in a smelly caravan,
waiting for him to get home.
- [Brink] Oh, that's fast.
- [Ferry] Yes.
John helped.
- [Brink] Hang in there.
- [Ferry] You too.

[woman shouts]
- [man] Just listen for a moment.
- [woman] Let me go.
- Just two minutes. Come on.
- Beer, cut it out.
Get your hands off me.
I'm not in the mood.
It's full of cops here. I'll call one.
- You're hurting me.
- So.
- Hey.
- Mind your own business, OK?
Is he bothering you?
Yes, he's bothering me.
Let go.
I'll ask nicely once, OK?
[woman breathing heavily]
[grunting]
[grunts]
Keep your hands off her
or I'll break all your bones.
Do you understand?
And now fuck off. Loser.
Get lost.
[man] Cunt.
- Are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.
What kind of loser is that?
My stalker.
My ex.
Or we're back together, I don't know.
It's confusing.
- Fuck, what a mess.
- I'll help.
No, you really don't have to.
You've done more than enough.
[grunts]
- You can't sell these now.
- No, they're trash.
It's kind of you, thanks.
- I'm Danielle, by the way.
- Ferry.
Hi.
Oh man, I'm really shaking all over.
Haven't I seen you before?
- I don't know.
- Camping Zonnedauw?
- That's where I live.
- Yes?
- I rent a caravan there.
- What a coincidence.
Do you live in the chalet
with the American flag?
- No.
- Oh, I saw you come out of there.
No, I clean there. That's my neighbor's.
Ah, I've never seen anyone else there.
No, he's often at his girlfriend's.
Will he stay there long?
Are you his girlfriend?
Sorry, I'm asking too much.
I'm just trying
to get to know the neighborhood.
- I live alone.
- Where are you from?
- Amsterdam.
- You don't sound like it at all.
- No, I'm originally from Brabant.
- And why are you here again?
My sister.
She's sick.
Cancer.
That's bad.
Sorry, can I offer you a drink or…
…a joint?
I have to go.
I've got to get up early tomorrow.
OK.
Well, maybe I'll see you at the campsite.
- See you around.
- Bye.
[crickets chirp]
[sound of car pulling up]
[eerie music plays]
[sighs]
HEY SIS, HOW ARE YOU?
[sighs]
[birds chirping]
[snorts and grunts]
What are you doing here?
[grunts]
Come on then.
[knocks on door]
Master's not home, right?
[cat meows]
[loud clattering]
[glass smashes]
- [knocking on door]
- [dog barks]
- [Danielle] Shakira, come here. Come on.
- [dog barking]
[dog growling]
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Sorry, did I wake you?
- I've been up for a while.
- Why are you here?
- I heard a noise at the neighbor's.
I saw a door open.
I think there was a burglary.
- No.
- Maybe we should check it out
- and give that boy a call.
- Yes, wait a minute.
- I'll put her in the bedroom.
- [dog barks]
Sorry, she's so young,
I don't want her sneaking out.
- [dog barking]
- OK, here I am.
[dog barking]
[birds chirping]
- Are you always up so early?
- No.
I was woken up by…
…the silence, I think.
That's weird.
- Oh no, Misha.
- Well, she's gone.
Fuck.
Oh, how awful.
[sighs]
Shit.
Ah, fuck. No, don't touch anything.
Don't leave your fingerprints.
- Fingerprints?
- Yes, for the cops.
The cops?
Shouldn't you just call that boy,
what's he called?
- Call Jason?
- Yes, do you think?
- It's his house.
- Yeah.
How did you know he's called Jason?
You said that.
Yesterday.
[mumbling on the phone]
Hey, it's me.
Yes, sorry.
Yes, it's really important.
There's been a burglary.
- [Jason] Where?
- Your place.
[Jason] Hey? When?
I don't know. The door was open.
Everything's upside down.
- [Jason] Goddamn it.
- Tell him to come here.
I think it's best
if you come see for yourself.
- [Jason] I'll be right there.
- OK.
- [Jason] Don't touch anything.
- OK.
- Is he coming?
- What an asshole.
- Is he coming?
- Yes.
- I can never do anything right for him.
- Then why do you work for him?
Yeah, I need the money.
Oh.
You don't do stuff like this. It's awful.
You must think it's always like this here.
That stuff yesterday, and now this.
It's not so bad.
Yeah, normally it's nice and quiet here…
…cozy.
A holiday all year round, you could say.
Shall I give you a tour?
How about this afternoon?
I can't.
- OK.
- I have to see my sister.
OK. Bye.
[sighs]
[car pulls up outside]
[eerie music plays]
[sniffs and grunts]
[gun clicks]
[sniffs]
[eerie music intensifies]
You robbed the wrong house.
Drive.
[heavy breathing]
Fuck.
[car engine starts]
[eerie music gets louder]
Where are we going?
You can stop over there on the left.
[engine stops]
[music ends]
How did you know where we were?
- We were hired.
- By who?
I don't know.
Are you fond of your balls?
I really don't know.
[gun clicks]
- My buddy organized everything.
- Who's your buddy?
Get lost, man.
Get out.
[car beeps]
[gun clicks]
We'll play a game. It's called one in six.
[man shouting in the distance]
Fucking madman.
[eerie music plays]
Hey.
Goddamn it.
Fuck.
[grunting]
[shouting]
Goddamn it.
[groaning and coughing]
[shouting]
What are you doing, man?
[grunting]
Who are your friends?
[groaning]
Who are your friends?
- Who are your friends?
- [Jason] Fuck you.
[shouting]
Stop screaming. Who are the other two?
- Fuck you.
- That's it?
- Yes.
- That's it?
- Yes.
- That's it?
Yes.
[shouting]
Brink sends his regards.
[gun clicks]
[whimpering]

Piss stain.
[grunts]
Inbox
I don't think about you in the shower.
Leave me alone.
Yo bro, sick shit today. Everything good?
What time are we leaving for Amsterdam?
Hey.
Jesus, look at you.
What happened?
- I fell.
- Fell? From a mountain or what?
- That needs disinfecting.
- I'll do it later.
No. Ferry, otherwise it'll get infected.
You'll get staphylococcus.
- Your hair will fall out.
- Really?
Yes, for real.
[gasps]
We have to do something about that.
Come with me. You helped me,
now I want to do something for you.
[growling]
[whimpers]
Did you rob a pharmacy or something?
[sighs]
I don't like pain.
Maybe you should take your shirt off.
With all those scrapes.
Oh, gosh.
OK, I'll try to be very careful.
Yeah, sorry.
How was your sister?
Fine.
Is that where you fell?
[grunts in agreement]
Mm-hm.
- You're not that close, are you?
- What do you mean?
When I mention her, you get all tense.
We're not that close, no.
Has it always been like that?
People change.
Well that's nice, right?
That despite everything, you're there
for her. That's what matters most.
I think that's OK now.
I'll grab a shirt
so you don't have to go out like that.
I bought it for Berend,
but he didn't like it.
- Ooh.
- [laughs]
Well, you can have it.
[gasps]
I have something for the pain.
It's made from hazelnuts.
Where did I put it?
Yes, here.
It was buy two get one free.
So you can give that to your sister.
Maybe it'll help.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
I'd love to chat,
but Shakira hasn't done her poop yet
and I have to open the stall at four.
OK.
[squeaks]
Sweetie, come.
[dog barks]
Come on.
Tonight is the last night of the fair.
If you want to do something fun
with your sister.
There will be fireworks. It'll be a party.
And I'll give you free cotton candy, OK?
Well, see how you feel.
You know where I'll be.
- See you.
- Bye.
Thank you.
[phone dial tone sounds]
- [Ferry] Brink.
- [Brink] Hey Fer, how's it going?
[Ferry] Jason has been dealt with.
I think I know how to get the second one.
- And you?
- [Brink] Mattijs is in a coma.
I slept by his bed last night.
Things are still uncertain.
[sighs]
[knocks on door]
[Claudia] It's open.
- Oh, it's you.
- Clau.
Shoes.
Sorry.
How's it going?
I didn't know you smoked.
I started two months ago.
What does it matter?
Next week
I'll move on to crack and heroin.
Sorry.
About your thing.
About my thing?
That you're sick.
We're not talking about it.
I have something for you.
- It's supposed to help with muscle pain.
- I mean it. I'm not pathetic.
I simply brought something for you.
It's the way you look at me.
What's that?
Some homeopathic nonsense?
Thank you.
[sniffs]
Where's John?
At the shop.
When will he be back?
Oh, it's like that.
- What?
- That's why you're here.
Hey, what?
I brought something for you, didn't I?
- You do everything for yourself.
- Fuck off, man.
Why do I make an effort?
- An effort?
- Yes.
You clearly don't like me.
You stay away from me for five years
then you think
everything's suddenly OK again?
So it's my fault
you didn't tell me you have cancer.
You know what? I'm out of here.
We'll see each other again in ten years.
- Don't bother, I'll be dead anyway.
- Well then, good riddance.
[car beeps]
Goddamn it.
Cunt.
[grunts]
[sighs]
[car beeps]
Hey, Fer.
- Everything OK?
- Great.
And that wife of yours too.
Are you leaving again?
Don't you ever check your phone?
I have a question. Do you know any cops
who want to earn a bit extra?
Well, I might know a guy who knows a guy.
I have the phone number
from a certain Davy.
- I want to know where he's at.
- Phone number?
- That'll cost you.
- It doesn't matter. Brink's paying.
- I'll see what I can do.
- Great.
Nice shirt.
[sniffs]
[fairground music plays]
Neighbor
Hey, you came.
And on your own.
Yes.
Yeah,
my sister wasn't feeling so good, so…
Well, that's a shame.
On another note, you work here
and I guess you sometimes see things.
And there's a big party tonight
and people may want to go a little crazy
so they take something, right?
You know what I mean.
Oh.
Drugs.
You don't have to come to the fair
for that.
What are you looking for?
White.
Well neighbor,
we're getting to know each other now.
And just for you?
Hard day, I guess.
You're not a talker.
So, you want to blow off steam.
Is it always coke?
Yes.
Shall I tell you a secret?
Sometimes you have to take a vacation
in your own head.
Ecstasy?
Do you always carry it?
Well, I'm off tomorrow. I'm done here.
We can share.
Neighbor…
…you're full of surprises.
Just like these pills.
Full of surprises, peace and love.
So, you can choose. If you want coke,
then I can arrange something.
Or you can join me on a nice vacation.
This really is the best pill
you've ever had. I swear.
Oh, exciting. Now we wait till it works.
[fairground music intensifies]
And is it starting to kick in?
Your sister wasn't doing so well?
- Do we have to talk about that now?
- No, not if you don't want to.
We can only talk for five minutes
and then we get in each other's hair.
Oh no, I didn't mean that.
You said she wasn't feeling well?
- Oh, you had a fight.
- For five years now.
- No.
- Yes.
Five years?
Tell me.
She got married to a friend of mine
and according to our family traditions,
we honor the dead
by having a drink at their graves.
And my mom and dad
have been dead for years.
- Oh, how terrible.
- Not at all, no.
Yes, my mother, but not my father.
- He was an asshole.
- Shame.
I'd already lived in Amsterdam
for a few years, so I never came home.
What do you do in Amsterdam.
- Business.
- Mysterious.
So after the service,
we went to the grave.
Suddenly I see that my father's name
had been carved into it.
Claudia had just added my father to it.
- No.
- Yeah, and I was furious.
- My father belonged in the dump.
- And then?
Well, then I made a fuss,
I started a fight and she threw me out.
- Maybe I am an asshole.
- No.
You're not an asshole.
I've seen what you're like.
Anyone who stands up
for a woman they don't know
is no asshole. Believe me, no asshole.
And I really love her too.
That's so important. Me too.
I love my brother so much.
I have a brother.
Did I mention I have a brother?
Do you have a brother? You didn't say, no.
Did you say that? I don't know.
- I'm talking a lot.
- It's starting to work, isn't it?
Yes. It's starting to work.
- Nice, right?
- Yeah, groovy pills.
[fairground music further intensifies]
[cheering and laughter]
[fairground music ends]
[birds chirping]
[dog scratching and yelping]
[dog barking]
Hey.
Did I snore too loud?
When I drink, I start snoring. Awkward.
- I didn't hear anything.
- That's lucky.
[dog barks]
Oh, shit. I shouldn't have touched
those nasty shots.
- I told, you didn't I?
- Yes, I know.
[dog barking]
Fuck, she has to pee.
Oh, no. Bad idea.
[dog barking]
Can you go outside for a moment?
- I don't know how to do that.
- Just down the street here.
Otherwise she'll keep barking
and my head is already about to explode.
Please.
Don't look at me like that.
[grunting]
- You're a sweetheart.
- Yeah.
[dog barking]
The poop bags are under the sink.
The poop bags are under the sink.
Hey, hurry up.
[phone rings]
- Yes.
- [John] It's me.
I have Davy's address. I'll text you.
OK, thank you.
Come on.
- [Danielle] Hey.
- [dog barking]
- Come here and I'll let you free.
- Hey, sweetie.
Come here.
Hey, sweetie. Hello.
Hello. Hi.
[kissing noises]
And are you OK?
Well, I just threw up twice.
Eat some eggs. Good for your liver.
I really can't think about food right now.
And you?
Would you like breakfast here?
I have to go.
OK.
Yeah,
I had a really great time last night.
Me too.
See you later?
See you later.
Yeah, I'd like to kiss you
but I just threw up.
You're a weird one.
[house music plays]
[knock on the door]
Yes?
Package for Davy Mols.
[gun clicks]
Leave it at the door. I'll get it later.
No, I can't do that.
I need a signature.
[dramatic music plays]
[grunting]
[gunshot sounds]
[gunshot sounds]
[grunting]
[gunshot sounds]
[gun clicks]
- Who are you working for?
- Who do you think?
It was one of your own men.
Who?
Mattijs.
Ow.
- You're lying.
- He was in trouble.
He needed money. His dad cut him off.
It's true.
- Then why was he shot?
- An accident. I swear.
I saw a gun and I fired.
- Who was the third?
- A dude from the campsite.
- One of Jason's guys.
- Name.
Lars.
Lars van Marken.
Please bro, I don't want to…
[gunshot sounds]
[heavy breathing]
[phone rings]
Yo.
He's dead.
Fer…
- Mattijs is dead.
- What?
[Brink sighs]
[acoustic music plays]
It started to make a noise, to beep.
They tried everything.
[sighs]
- Did you find the second one?
- Yeah.
Taken care of.
And do you know who the third is?
[Ferry] Yes.
Lars van Marken.
Make him suffer.
[music playing on the radio]
Come in.
[music stops]
- How was it?
- Yeah…
- Let's not talk about it.
- Oh, really? Such a day?
- How are you?
- Yeah, much better.
I just lay down for a while and showered.
I'm a whole new person.
[laughs]
I'm going to make toasties
and chill in front of the TV with a joint.
- Would you like to join me?
- Yes.
OK, go sit down then.
- Beer?
- Yes.
[cracks a beer open]
- Here you go, honey.
- Thanks.
[twinkly music plays]
[sighs]
[talking on the TV]
I would love to go to Amsterdam sometime.
Then we should do that.
I don't know, it just never happens.
Yeah, I recently saw something
about the Magere Brug in a magazine.
- It's supposed to be nice. Do you know it?
- It's very beautiful.
Personally, I always stay in the center.
There's a bench there.
Then I get a sandwich and a beer.
I just sit there, and be left alone.
- [laughing] What?
- Nice.
I see who you are.
Underneath that tough exterior
is a gentle heart.
Hi.
- Hey.
- Oh, hello. Hey.
Sorry to interrupt.
I've come to drop off those eggs
and I have a surprise.
For me? Oh, from the petting zoo.
So good, that rice pudding.
You're a sweetheart, little brother.
Jesus, you sounded hungover on the phone,
but when I see your face.
Fer, this is my brother.
Yes, I can see that.
- Hello.
- Hey.
- Heard a lot about you.
- Good things?
- No, of course not.
- Luckily.
- Ferry.
- Ferry.
I've not heard anything about you.
Yes, kidding.
I am Lars.
[eerie music plays]
- Lars?
- Yeah.
People think I was named after Lars Ulrich
but he was only ten then.
Fer.
- This is so good, you have to try it.
- What? No.
- Is something wrong?
- No.
- Put the eggs in the fridge.
- Yes.
But in this weather…
DANIELLE VAN MARKEN
So, Ferry, you just moved here?
- For good or…?
- No.
He's here for his sick sister.
Yes, he came back here
especially from Amsterdam.
- That's really sweet.
- Amsterdam?
Ah.
- How long have you been here?
- A few days.
What must he think of us,
Berend was looking for a fight,
Jason's chalet was broken into.
Yeah. What a coincidence.
Did you find it?
Yes, I heard a noise
and went to have a look.
- Have you heard from Jason?
- I called him to tell him.
- No, after that.
- No, he's probably at his girlfriend's.
I don't know.
I need him but he's not answering.
Maybe that's a good thing.
You know what I think.
Have you seen Jason, Ferry?
How long are you staying?
It depends how things go.
- What's your line of business?
- Lars, don't interrogate him.
Can't I ask about his work?
He always does this with new friends.
- Catering.
- Is that enough, Lars?
- Can we have fun again?
- I have to go.
Hey, come on now.
Yeah, no, I really have to go.
I just came to drop those off.
I have to go.
- As if you ever have to be anywhere.
- Yeah, bye Daantje.
Ferry, till next time.
- Sure.
- Yeah, what's up with him suddenly?
- Sorry.
- It doesn't matter.
Lars is special,
but I don't know what I'd do without him.
I left my wallet at my sister's,
I have to go back.
OK.
Hey, Fer?
We're OK, right?
[ticking sounds]
[eerie music intensifies]
[grunting]
Dirty bastard.
[coughing]
- What were you doing with my sister?
- I didn't know she was your sister.
I'm sorry about your friend.
If I'd known, I wouldn't have taken part.
I didn't want any victims.
[grunting]
Never threaten someone
if you can't finish it.
- Please.
- Into the woods.
- Please.
- Walk.
- Please.
- Walk.
Please, I'm walking.
Please. You have to believe me.
You've got it wrong.
I only did it for Daan.
I wanted to help.
- She works herself to death.
- Shut up.
- She works herself to death, OK?
- Shut up.
I wanted to pay her back.
We only have each other, OK?
We only have each other.
I'm sorry.
[whimpering]
On your knees.
You have to believe me.
It was a one-off.
I haven't even had money from them yet.
I was only the driver.
[gunshot sounds]
[ringing sound]
Hey.
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah.
Will you stay at your sister's?
- What does it matter?
- Well, I don't know.
We don't have each other's numbers, do we?
- Are you just leaving suddenly?
- I'm done here.
And will we still see each other?
We've known each other for two days
and fucked once.
Did you think we were getting married?
How old are you?
- Well, I thought we clicked.
- Yeah, it was fun.
Bye.

[sad music plays]
[music gets louder and eerier]
[motion sensors beep]
[crickets chirp]
[music stops]
[background chatter]
[melancholy music plays]
Hey.
Hi, Fer.
Goddamn it.
[crying]
I'm glad you're back.
Did it work out?
Come on.
[music and chatter stops]
Is this your work?
That's number one.
Number two will show up soon.
And the last one, Van Marken?
Him too.
Lived at the campsite.
Out of sight. No prying eyes.
I followed him into the woods
and shot him there.
Easy-peasy.
Of course, that won't bring Mattijs back.
He was a neurotic, we all know that.
But yeah…
Yeah, he was also a good kid.
Do you know who ratted us out?
No.
They said they'd been watching us
for a while, they followed the couriers.
We have to change the system.
- Be more careful.
- That's taken care of.
I wanted to be safe rather than sorry.
OK. Well done.
Rico handled the business
while you were gone.
So.
[bangs table]
Let's drink.
Hey, man.
Thank you.
[melancholy music plays quietly]
[music ends]
[piano music plays quietly]
[phone dial tone sounds]
- [Claudia] Do you always call this late?
- Hey.
Hey, Ferry.
Clau, I…
…wanted to say something.
I want to say sorry
for what happened at your wedding.
It's OK.
How's it going?
I'm dying.
But I had a good day. Not much pain.
That stuff you gave me does help.
John and I cycled a bit.
We ate some steak. It was good.
That's nice.
That's nice.
If I'm grateful for something,
it's that I got to know John through you.
Without him it would've been worthless.
OK.
- Are you back in Amsterdam?
- Yeah.
And the business is done?
Could you do what you had to do?
Yes.
OK.
Goodnight, then.
Goodnight, sis.
[piano music gets louder]
[TV sounds]
[Danielle] I love my brother so much.
[sniffs]
[gunshot sounds]
I was just the driver.
Fuck.
Fuck.
My boss will never find out.
If he finds out,
he'll burn this place down.
I'll keep quiet. I swear.
Are you going to be late every day?
Your sister…
…will never find out about this.
- You'll never have to see me again.
- I swear.
[answer phone tone beeps]
[Brink] Fer, have you left?
Rico said you were acting strange.
Is everything OK?
[answer phone tone beeps]
Ferry, where are you?
I'm here alone again. Are you coming?
[clock ticking]
[ticking gets louder]
[ticking stops]
[silence]
TWO MONTHS LATER
[phone rings]
[Brink] What now? We have an appointment
with those Moroccans.
Sorry man, I overslept. I'm coming.
[Brink] Never mind.
Come to the Arena right away.
[grunts]
[Rico] Well, right on time, dickhead.
Sorry.
- What's happening?
- What do you think?
We're done here.
Rico arranged it, for a good price too.
They'll deliver later.
Man, what's up with you?
Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing?
You're either cranky, drunk or too late.
Go home. Take a vacation, take a course.
I don't care, but do something about it.
Get yourself together.
You're no use to me like this.
It'll be fine.
- What time later?
- Five o'clock. I'll pick you up.
By that bench of yours.
We'll get a Happy Meal.

[laughs]
You're in Amsterdam.
On a hen party.
A colleague of mine is getting married.
- Cleaning lady colleague?
- No, I work in a hair salon now.
- Do you like Amsterdam?
- Yes, it's just great here.
It's really…
- This is a nice spot.
- Yes.
- I'm glad to see you.
- Yeah.
- And how's your sister?
- Yeah, fine.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Yeah, we made up.
We call each other a lot.
And she's doing well.
She's showing the doctors a thing or two.
Good for her.
- Sorry.
- Man, what a shit goodbye that was.
Yeah.
Yeah, I thought that was really harsh.
I mean…
Maybe I was getting ahead of myself.
We'd only just met.
But yeah, for me…
That evening and the way we clicked
was really special for me.
So yeah, I've thought about it a lot.
I liked it too.
But you deserve someone better than me.
Someone who can give you what you need.
- Can I decide that myself?
- [Rico] Hey, dickhead, what's this?
Do you have a girlfriend
I don't know about?
Jesus, Rico.
Hello.
Rico is a colleague.
We had an appointment.
Oh, there's plenty of time.
I'm too early.
I am Rico. I'm his favorite colleague.
- Who are you?
- I'm Danielle.
- We're just acquaintances.
- Oh, just acquaintances, sure.
I know that. Danielle from the south?
Is it really that obvious?
I can't hide it.
I'm here for a hen party with my friends.
Yeah, I thought
you don't look like a real nun.
- Sorry Daan, but we have to go.
- Are you embarrassed?
Hey listen, Daan…
…how did you meet?
We know each other from the campsite.
Ferry was taking care of his sick sister
and I live there with my brother.
- Well, come on.
- Fer, we're staying at the Parklane hotel.
If you fancy a coffee tomorrow,
let me know.
The reservation is in my name, Van Marken.
But you can also just text me.
I'm really on the ball again.
Well, have a great time
in our beautiful capital, Danielle.
- Thanks.
- Come on.
But Fer, you don't have my number.
I'll find you.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Yes.
That all looks good.
Load it up.
Fer, can you help?
- Do it yourself.
- I have to make a call.
[ominous music plays]
[Rico] Yes, that's good. We're coming.
We have to go to Brink.
- Why?
- Does it matter?
Gentlemen, it was a pleasure, as always.
Thank you. Till next time.
Are you coming, dickhead?
- Brink.
- [Brink] Ferry.
What's this?
Sit down.
Just a quick chat to clear some things up
and reassure Rico.
He says you cheated us.
I don't think that's possible.
That's not possible.
I trust Ferry with my life.
Rico must be wrong.
But we still have some questions
about Lars van Marken.
Tell me again how that…
…how that went exactly.
Jesus, guys, really? Unbelievable.
So…
Davy said Lars is the third man.
He lives on a campsite,
I went there, I waited for him.
He ran into the woods, I followed him
and I shot him.
Jason and Davy are in the newspaper
but not Van Marken.
No, it was a big forest.
Maybe they haven't found him yet.
Who was that girl this afternoon?
- Danielle.
- Oh, yeah.
[grunts]
That's just a girl from the campsite.
I got bored at night.
Danielle van Marken.
Yes.
I didn't know that either.
We didn't do a lot of talking,
if you know what I mean.
Is that so?
- Jesus, Brink.
- [Brink] I'm worried about you.
I thought, something must have happened
in the south that changed him.
But what? You've never been a big talker.
We all know that.
And then Rico called
and everything fell into place.
Did you lie about Lars?
- No.
- [Brink] You can tell me.
- No.
- I won't get mad.
- But I need to know.
- I'm not lying.
Do we have to go ask that girl?
Leave her out of it.
It's about my son.
I need to know.
You want to know?
You really want to know?
Do you want to know the truth?
It was Mattijs.
Mattijs was behind the robbery.
- What are you saying?
- Mattijs was behind it.
He was mad at you
for not wanting to help him with his mess.
That's bullshit.
You said we were followed.
I said that to protect you.
- Shut up man. That's nonsense.
- What if I had said it?
- You're lying.
- Your own son robbed you.
I shot two of them.
The third didn't deserve it.
That's the truth.
Why are you doing this, Fer?
Hey?
I love you, man.
And I've already lost a son.
Finish it.
Please.
Do it for me, and this stays between us.
I can't.
If you don't tell us
where we can find Van Marken…
…then we'll have to ask that girl.
[ominous music gets louder]
That's not going to happen.
Sorry, then.
[grunts]
Go get that girl.
Parklane hotel.
[tense music plays]
[grunting]
Don't make it harder than it is, Fer.
[gasping]
[Rico] Ferry, calm down, man.
[Brink] Calm down, Fer,

You could jump on him.
- You can't do that.
- Why?
Guys…
Shh.
Guys, seriously.
Shh.

Ooh.

- [woman] Daan, come on.
- Yeah, go ahead.
Shh.
Hey.
I have coffee if you want it.
No.

I don't even like coffee.
I don't know why I said that.
This one is cold anyway.
Daan, sorry.
For everything.
I missed you so much and I…

Do you want something else?
Chicken soup.
- Chicken soup?
- Yeah, I've been out all night.
- I really feel like chicken soup.
