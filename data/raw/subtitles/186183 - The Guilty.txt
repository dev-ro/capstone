[MUSIC - MANSUN, "WIDE OPEN
 SPACE"]
I'm in a wide open
space and standing
GUARD: Corrigan, 84971.
You can go.
It's always quiet
through my ceiling.
The roof comes in and
crashes in a daze.
I'm in a wide open space.
It's freezing.
You'll never get to Heaven with
a smile on your face from me.
[splashing]
Hey, Corrigan.
We got a message for you.
What message?
Your mommy called.
She said she was sorry
she couldn't make it.
She had to go to work.
Get in.
Yeah!
DENNIS: So how was it?
Ah, it was beautiful, Dennis.
I'm thinking about
going back next year.
Who's car is this?
Oh, and I got you a
job if you want one.
Same place as me.
- Nah.
I'm good, man.
I got plans.
What plans?
Venezuela.
I met this guy inside,
and he's telling me
all about this oil rig.
So I figured, you know, I get
my a passport, a little cash,
and a ticket out of here.
All I need is a start.
Oh yeah.
Where do you get starts from?
Is it yours, Leo?
The car?
It's stolen.
Yeah.
You picked me up in a fucking
stolen car, Leo, Dennis.
Are you kidding me?
LEO: I feel a little bit of
a crash and dash coming on.
What are you doing, Leo?
Stop the car.
Hey!
Pull over!
[horn honking]
Stop the fucking car!
LEO: Go right in.
NATHAN: Leo, pull over.
[MUSIC - LUNATIC CALM, "LEAVE
 YOU FAR BEHIND"]
I want to tell you that
I'm feeling closer.
LEO: I can't see.
NATHAN: Leo, pull over.
Oh shit.
[crash]
[alarm blaring]
Woohoo!
Come on, boys.
Let's get some booze.
Yeah.
Party.
Come on.
Let's go.
[bottles shatter]
Let's go.
Come on, man.
Nathan.
Time to party.
[tires screech]
Nathan, hold on.
[inaudible] Wait up.
Stop the truck.
Wait.
No.
No.
Woo!
[gunshot]
Hey, Leo.
What are you doing?
Put it away.
Put that fucking shit away.
Look out!
LEO: All right.
[inaudible]
NATHAN: What are
you carrying for?
LEO: I didn't hit anyone.
Don't be such a dink.
NATHAN: Are you kidding me, Leo.
I just got out of fucking jail.
Six months for
ripping off a few cars.
Big deal.
Don't ever, ever
do that to me again.
You hear me?
It ain't like it
used to be, honey.
[laugh]
It never was.
Smoke a joint.
Let's go, Dennis.
CALLUM CRANE: Justice, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury.
Justice.
What is it?
And what is it worth?
In a libel case like this we
have to put a value on it.
Though of course, it's not just
about money and never has been.
There's a speech I
remember being made
to learn by heart at school.
Time to find a new assistant.
Are you sure
that's the quotation?
You left it on your chair.
That's not what
you tell Mr. Crane.
CALLUM CRANE: It's Shakespeare.
"Who steals my
purse steals trash.
Tis something, nothing.
Twas mine, tis his, and has
been slave to thousands.
But he that steals
my good name robs me
of that which not enriches
him and makes me poor indeed."
He's the senior
partner in the firm,
which means after
me he's the most
important person you'll meet.
Remember the way.
You'll be doing this a lot
when he's got a gig on.
I saw him on the
news last night
talking about the Russell case.
Should end today.
Crane hasn't got a hope.
All Selena is going to
be getting is his bill.
CALLUM CRANE: Selena Russell
was bankrupt in every sense
after that newspaper
article appeared.
It finished her career.
And as you've heard, she
can't get on a plane.
She can't go into a restaurant
without people thinking-- no,
believing that
she's nothing better
than a common prostitute.
Is that justice?
No.
It's a human crime.
And for what was
this crime committed?
A tabloid newspaper
article, 22nd
read on the nation's toilet.
Is that justice?
My client's reputation
is her career.
And her career is her life.
And her life is in ruins.
I ask you a final time.
Is that justice?
Well, if not, you tell
me how much is it worth?
Where's is that
little shit, Miles?
His ass is fired.
[chatter]
I'm sorry, Mr. Crane.
I got to be honest
with you, she lost it.
You're a fortunate man, Miles.
I remembered it, just.
How in the hell
did you win this one?
Got lucky with the weather.
Here's your fan
mail, sweetheart.
I got to get back to work.
Always do.
One is a parking ticket.
- Thanks, Aunt Maddy.
- Yeah.
Thanks, Mom.
It was great.
What's that?
Uh, my birth certificate.
What do you want that for?
I told you, Mom.
I'm getting my passport.
You're not serious
about that oil rig thing.
Yeah.
You tell him.
It's a stupid idea.
Hey, you could still rip
off cars during the weekend.
Nathan.
Give it to me.
I'll get your passport for you.
Nope.
You lost the last one.
Let's go.
It's a good thing I have
time to clean up, huh.
Hey.
What's up?
Ma.
Nathan, I--
Ma, please don't
lie to me anymore.
I met your--
I mean Martin.
When I was pregnant with you.
NATHAN: How come
you never told me?
Hm?
I mean I wasted my whole
life listening to you.
It was your mother's decision.
My whole life, you've
been telling me what to do.
I adopted you.
I gave you everything
you wanted.
Criticizing me.
Preaching to me.
You ungrateful--
You never loved me.
But you know what, you're
not my father, and I'm glad.
You know I never felt like
I belonged here with him.
But I might have a
family somewhere.
Your family is here.
Half of it.
His name is Callum Crane.
He was a law student.
Does he know about me?
MADDY: I never told him.
Why not?
He was very ambitious.
He wouldn't have wanted
to be held back by us.
Yeah.
But maybe if you
had told him things
would have been different.
Not necessarily better.
He's not the answer to
your problems, Nathan.
He won't want to know you.
Better.
REPORTER (ON TV): Fashion model
Selena Russell left the city
courtroom this
afternoon considerably
richer than when she went in.
$2 million is one of the
largest libel settlements
ever rewarded in
this kind of case
and is a personal victory
against all the odds for Callum
Crane, one of the
country's leading
criminal defense attorneys.
And in other news tonight,
a fire broke out down--
All right.
That's the last bottle.
I have to get up next week.
[sigh]
Will they appeal?
I would if I were them.
In fact, I may even suggest it.
One day, Callum, you're a
genius for getting the guilty
off and winning undeserving
lowlifes vast sums of money
will be punished, I hope.
I bet I make federal
judge before you.
You're a devious,
amoral hypocrite.
Exactly.
Give Natalie my love.
She prefers diamonds.
How is she?
Who knows?
She's asleep when I leave,
and asleep when I get back.
For all I know,
she never gets up.
See you tomorrow.
Drive carelessly.
[elevator dings]
[dial tone humming]
CALLUM CRANE: [clears throat]
You scared me.
I'm sorry.
What are you doing here?
Having a great night out
with my friends, Mr. Crane.
What are you doing here?
This is my first day.
And Miles said he
was breaking me in.
Leave it.
I'll give you a ride home.
SOPHIE: Are you sure, Mr. Crane?
You can call me sir.
[chatter]
So what do you want to drink?
I'm buying.
Drink.
Uh, whiskey sour, double.
So what about you?
You don't want to be one of our
secretaries your whole life.
I don't want to be one
of your secretaries at all.
So what do you want?
An easy job which pays
very well with absolutely
no skill or education required.
Such as?
Miles'.
Well, I think I'm
well overqualified.
Are you married?
I'm really not sure.
Are you?
What do you think?
I never think unless I'm paid.
Are you trying to get
me drunk, Mr. Crane, sir?
No.
Why not?
Do you mind if we sit down?
I'd rather watch
you fall over.
I thought the idea
was to get me drunk.
I know.
What are you trying to
do, take advantage of me?
I haven't decided yet.
I think the milk is bad.
Whoa.
Ah.
Shit.
I'm sorry.
I think this is a terrible idea.
No.
Why?
You are married.
You're drunk.
You're my boss.
You take your pick.
[groan] You want to.
I don't want to.
Not anymore.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
[coughing]
Sophie.
Sophie.
You OK?
So sorry.
I'm so drunk.
Leave.
Just leave.
[whimpering]
[door shuts]
[gasp]
NATALIE: Callum, is that you?
No.
[thunder]
[AMATEURISH CLASSICAL MUSIC
 PLAYING ON PIANO]
Shut up!
[notes bang on piano]
How dare you speak
to Faith like that?
She's practicing.
Why isn't she at school?
Why aren't you at work?
I'm not going in for a while.
I'm taking a vacation.
Well, I'll be glad
to help you pack.
What is wrong with you, Callum?
Anyone would have thought
you lost that case.
Yeah.
You're going to have to
go in sometime, Sophie.
I'm thinking about
getting another job.
It took you months
to get that one.
You can still go to the police.
I don't want to talk about it.
Tell me to do something then.
Tell me his name,
and I'll report him.
I keep going over
how it happened.
I led him on, Tan.
I'm so stupid.
You said no, and no means no.
Don't let that bastard
get away with it.
Your ex-husband's here.
What does he want?
- Damn.
He's early.
Faith, Amy, daddy's here.
FAITH: We're coming.
Let him in.
Would you, Callum?
And don't mention work.
And why not?
He got fired this week
along with half the agency.
[doorbell rings]
Giles.
Hello.
So how's work?
- Natalie didn't tell you.
- No.
What?
Daddy.
Hey.
FAITH: Daddy.
It's so good to see you.
Pick me up.
Can we go for ice cream?
- So how's my little princess?
- No.
Let's go swimming.
Oh, Callum, someone
called Miles phoned.
He said you have to go to
the office immediately.
Let's stay up real late.
FAITH: Dad.
Dad.
- Why?
What else did he say?
Faith.
So what's this urgent
problem I had to come in for?
You've got a meeting with
the CEO of Trans Pacific,
starting uh--
three quarters of an hour ago.
Where is he?
On the conference
room ceiling.
Thank you, Miles.
Look.
About the other night--
[elevator dings]
I'll take the stairs.
CALLUM CRANE: I'm a
little unhappy, Miles.
The efficiency in the
office, the atmosphere,
would you say that
it's all it used to be?
- Um.
- No.
No.
I was wondering, and
that new secretary--
Sophie?
Hm.
What do you think?
Difficult to say.
I'm not so sure either.
Obviously, it's
completely your decision.
You think maybe she's um--
Well, like I said, it's
completely up to you.
I thought may--
you and she were um--
No.
No.
Right.
I just wanted to
get your opinion.
Fired?
Yeah.
You're still on
your trial period.
No warning necessary.
Why?
What did I do?
Call in next week to
pick up your paycheck,
and clear your desk.
[thunder rumbles]
- What do you want?
- What do I want?
Harassed, propositioned, raped,
and fired in my first week.
What more could I possibly want?
Exactly what I've
given you, a fresh start.
You know how bad I
could make things for you?
How?
You don't have a chance
of proving anything.
And since the other
night, you've been let go,
so any fuss you
make now is going
to look like cheap revenge.
Plus you're getting a month's
pay, which is very generous.
If I were your lawyer,
I'd really have to advise
against taking any action.
I'm glad we could talk.
No.
No.
He isn't.
Hold on.
He just came in.
What are all those
cars doing outside.
You've totally
forgotten, haven't you?
Forgotten what?
Most of them are your friends.
Ugh.
God.
Who's this?
The Department of Justice.
Have you been a
naughty boy, Callum?
Hello.
What has two thumbs, is
French, and loves a blow job?
Moi.
[laughter]
Callum, are you all right?
No.
I'm a federal judge.
A judge?
You made federal judge.
I-- I don't believe it.
Neither do I.
Somebody down there likes me.
To you.
[thunder]
Do you ever look
at the sky and think
there must be something up
there controlling our destiny?
No.
Neither do I.
So what happens now?
I finish this
bottle and fall over.
Then, next week, I
get sworn in and start
controlling other
people's destinies.
It's a funny life.
It's all happened so quickly.
One minute, you're a drunk
earning millions of dollars
a year lying to judges.
And the next minute,
you're the judge.
Not exactly how I
would have put it.
The amazing thing is I've
actually got away with it.
Gotten away with what?
Oh, everything.
DENNIS: Leo, answer
that, will you?
Leo.
[phone ringing]
Leo.
NATHAN (ON PHONE): Dennis,
I'm going into the city.
I'm going to try to find my dad.
That won't take long.
NATHAN (ON PHONE): Yeah.
I got his work
address, you know.
So it's a start.
Listen.
Tell my mom I'm like,
uh, sick or something.
You are.
By the way, I, uh--
I borrowed Leo's car.
DENNIS (ON PHONE):
That was nice of him.
Well, I was hoping you
could break it to him.
You know, sort of
uh-- sort of gently.
Nathan!
[dial tone humming]
[knocking]
Hey.
Excuse me, uh--
Tell Leo we're
looking for him.
Hm.
Tanya.
He's not picking up.
Well, we're going to be
late for the open house.
Hey, Tan.
Can you do me a favor and
pick up my paycheck for me
at the law office?
Sure.
When?
They're expecting you.
OK.
Well, where are you going?
To see a man about a job.
TANYA: What job?
His.
[elevator dings]
LAWYER: I agree.
It's looking good.
I wonder who that is.
NATHAN: Um.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Hi.
I'm looking for uh--
I'm looking for Mr. Crane.
Mr. Crane doesn't
work here anymore.
Oh.
Well, um, can I get his home
address of where he lives?
He's a federal judge
for Christ's sake.
I'm not giving
anyone his address.
[beep]
Yes.
Look, sir.
This is really important.
So is this.
A paycheck for who?
Sophie Lennon.
Yes, send her to accounting.
Look.
If it's that urgent, he'll
be in tomorrow evening.
You can come back then.
[cellphone ringing]
Hello.
Oh, hi, Conor.
No.
Oh, which house?
[horn honking]
[crash]
[gasp] Oh.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Sir, are you OK?
What?
Are you OK?
- Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Just--
[engine sputters]
Thank god.
Is it OK?
- Nope.
- Oh god.
Your car.
[gasp] My insurance.
Oh god.
I have to call the police.
Oh no, no, no, no.
I don't want to--
I don't want to bother the cops.
I mean unless you do.
But your car.
Don't worry about it.
It's a-- it's a wreck.
I'm not going to claim.
You mean it?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I-- I'll give you a ride.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Wherever you were going.
All right.
I was um-- actually
heading down to Mexico.
Excuse me?
Yeah.
It's the first day
of my vacation.
I was driving down to Mexico.
Oh no.
What have I done?
Is that true?
- Complete lie.
I was going for a drink.
It's been a long day.
OK.
But I'm buying.
Congratulations, Callum.
- Thanks.
- Callum.
Tom.
Well done.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hello, Joyce.
Behave yourself.
Judge.
Well done, Callum.
Glad to have you with us.
Couldn't have happened
to a nicer person.
So this horse
walks into a bar,
and the bartender says,
what's with the long face?
I'm sorry you got stuck
with this one, sweetheart.
Shall I take over?
I hope you can stand
the drop in income.
I'm sending the
children out to work.
That'll be the stripper gram.
NATALIE: That would
be typical bad taste
like all of your jokes.
BRENT: What's wrong with them?
They're terrible.
But they kinda
grow on you though.
Stop.
How is everything?
Yeah.
Fine.
You?
You know ever since
our little chat,
I assumed there was
nothing I could do.
You being a lawyer and paid a
fortune for twisting the truth.
Like you said, it was
your word against mine.
While you were a lawyer.
Then it occurred to me.
Now you're a judge, I don't
have to prove anything.
All I have to do is
make an accusation,
and you're finished.
Take some free legal advice.
Be very careful how
you handle this.
Do you have any idea what
you'll have to go through?
Do you really want to
do that to yourself?
No.
But I will unless you resign.
I'm not vindictive.
You can go back to lying
for a living for all I care.
But the thought of
you being a judge
on a rape case or something.
Sophie, you're upset, and
that's entirely understandable.
But I know the system, and I've
seen what it can do to people.
And believe me,
the only real way
to get over this
painful misunderstanding
is to let it go.
Otherwise, it will take
over your whole life.
And I just can't see
the point of that.
Can't you?
Look.
I know it's difficult
being out of work.
If there's anything more
that I can give you--
I didn't come here
to bargain with you.
You raped me.
And if I haven't read
by the end of the week
that you've resigned, I'm going
to the police and the papers.
I'll see myself out.
[MUSIC - ERMANNO MAURO, "NESSUN
 DORMA"]
NATHAN: So I got 12
months for first offense.
I got six for good behavior.
Wow.
NATHAN: Yeah.
TANYA: That must have
been just awful in court.
NATHAN: It was.
It was.
I mean I saw my whole
life flash in front of me,
and I wasn't even in it.
What do you want?
Zucchini?
I don't think I
want another father
that doesn't want to know.
I didn't expect him
to be so different.
What do you mean?
Well, the offices, and--
I don't know.
He just-- he's from a
complete different world.
And besides, I don't even
know if I'm the sort of son
that I'd want.
Here.
Sophie.
This is Nathan.
I destroyed his car tonight.
Got a minute, Tan?
Who the hell is that?
I bumped into him when
I picked up your paycheck.
- And?
- OK.
I like him.
So if you can keep
your hands off.
I'll force myself.
He's come here to
look for his dad,
so I said that he could
stay for a little while.
Where?
TANYA: On the couch.
Unless I get lucky.
Oh, Jesus, Tanya.
You got to be kidding me.
Oh, he's the sweetest guy.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.
No.
This is our apartment.
You don't tell me who
can stay and who can't.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
[cough]
[distant dog barking]
[clinking]
NATALIE: So there you are.
Where did you disappear
to last night?
Hm?
I was worried.
It's funny.
You want something so much.
Your whole life
you think about it.
You plan for it.
And then when you get
it, it's like when
you were a kid opening
this big present
and finding something
really disappointing inside.
That didn't
happen in my family.
I think what I was trying
to say was it doesn't
feel right being a judge.
What are you talking about?
How would you
feel if I resigned?
Are you serious?
Why?
And do what?
You can't practice
as a lawyer again.
You've accepted a
federal judgeship.
Well, I don't know.
I'll think of something.
You'll think of something?
I think you've finally
lost your mind.
You want to give up everything
we've worked for, and for what?
To do something you'll think of?
Jesus!
This is insane.
[elevator dings]
[ding]
[ding]
[car alarm chirps]
Hey, man.
Where's your wallet?
You deaf, man?
I said your wallet.
[grunt]
[gasping]
[alarm blaring]
SECURITY (ON PA):
Stay where you are.
I'm calling the police.
[car starts]
Get in.
You OK?
Yeah.
[sirens blaring]
That was very
impressive back there.
Yeah.
Well, it takes practice.
So you often assault
people in parking garages?
No.
And what did I do
to deserve your help?
Nothing.
Nothing at all actually.
What do you do?
Um.
It varies, I guess.
OK.
You're clear here.
This is where
you're getting out.
You don't like the
police, do you?
Why?
When'd you get out?
What?
Prison.
You ask a lot of
questions, don't you?
Just one more.
You want to make a lot of money?
[chatter]
Hey.
Hey.
How'd it go?
Did you see him?
Well, what was he like?
What did he do?
What happened?
You know what, I didn't
really tell him about me yet.
Why not?
I don't know.
It didn't seem right, you know.
But I'm seeing him
again on Thursday.
He told me something
about a job.
A job?
Yeah.
I figured, you know, you do it
well, that's the perfect time
to tell him, you know.
Get on his good
side sort of thing.
- Mhm.
- I don't know.
It was-- it was weird.
You know, I'm sitting there.
I'm staring at him, and I'm
thinking this is my dad, right.
But it just didn't
feel like he was.
Well, turn my back
for two minutes.
Uh, Nathan, this is Conor.
Conor works with me.
Oh, hey.
Listen.
Is it OK if I stick
around till Thursday?
SOPHIE: Yeah.
[glass shatters]
[fire roars]
Oh, for Christ's sake.
[knocking]
Oh, darling.
This is so sudden.
I'm cooking Sophie dinner
tonight to cheer her up.
There's only enough for two.
Get it?
[scoffs]
Don't move.
Wow.
I want to remember
you like this always.
Uh-huh.
I've just been for an interview.
What happened?
[sigh] I burst into tears.
Tears?
Is that good?
I mean because I haven't--
I haven't been on too
many interviews myself.
Listen.
Why don't you uh-- why don't
you let me buy you dinner?
Sorry.
Tanya has arranged for Conor
to cook me dinner or something.
Well, where?
I mean there's no one
up in the apartment.
I've been trying to
get in for an hour.
Really?
Yeah.
SOPHIE: Maybe he's
called it off.
Dinner then?
[music playing]
So are you and Tanya?
No.
No, no, no.
Are you gonna be?
Why do you ask?
Like I said, I'm nosy.
Mhm.
Well, I-- I don't know.
I'm not much of
a judge of women.
You sound like someone
who's had his heart broken.
Actually, it's my ribs mostly.
You know, modern women--
they're very physical.
How long have you
know Tanya for?
Since seventh grade.
She's the best
person I've ever met.
You have no idea how lucky
you are that she likes you.
It's a good thing I called
and made reservations, huh?
SOPHIE: [giggling] My keys
are stuck in my sleeve.
Oh.
All right.
Hey, Tan.
Sophie, that is so
incredibly selfish.
I'm sorry.
This is my fault. I
shouldn't have um--
I'm tired.
See you in the morning.
[door slams]
You are so busted.
Um.
Yeah.
I guess I should get
back into the hallway
before someone else bags it.
You've been promoted to sofa.
[keys beep]
[phone ringing]
SOPHIE: Nathan,
can you get that?
Hello.
CALLUM CRANE (ON
PHONE): Sophie, please.
It's for you.
SOPHIE: Who is it?
Who is this?
Just tell her it's urgent.
Hey, he says it's urgent.
Hello.
Sophie, it's Callum Crane.
I just wanted to talk.
I didn't have time to apologize
properly the other night.
You caught me off
guard I'm afraid.
I didn't react well.
Fuck you.
I thought you were
meeting your dad.
I am.
Tonight.
Do I look good?
You think?
- Yeah.
You'll do.
So where's Sophie?
Look, Tan.
About last night, nothing--
Why do you like her?
I'm just curious.
Why do men find
her so attractive?
I can't-- I don't--
(WHISPERING) Never mind.
Just be careful tonight, Nathan.
Sometimes, people
can turn out to be
a really big disappointment.
There's something
I want to say.
Say it later.
For now, I want you to listen.
I got a problem.
I'm successful.
I got money, reputation, a
large house, a good family,
but I got a problem.
And the problem is blackmail.
A woman with whom I had a
brief sexual association
is taking advantage
of my position,
and I can no longer
meet her demands.
In spite of my attempts
to reason with her,
she's threatening to destroy
my career and my family
by revealing it
all to the press.
So why can't you
go to the police?
Because that's no guarantee
of keeping the story quiet,
and because destroying
somebody's life
isn't necessarily illegal.
It's not a solution.
Do you understand
what I'm saying?
No.
I don't.
If the woman disappeared,
so would the problem.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I believe
you can help me.
Why me?
Because I think
you need the money.
I think you're
capable, and you have
absolutely no connection
whatsoever with me,
the woman, or the problem.
I got one day left before
she carries out her threat.
In the envelope is a
photograph along with her name
and address.
$5,000 in untraceable cash
with a guarantee for another 25
afterwards.
If you don't want
it, I'm sure you know
somebody out there who does.
You're gonna
trust me with this?
I could spend this and
never see you again.
I don't have any alternative.
If you don't help me, I'm dead.
It's as simple as that.
That's it.
[car starts]
LEO: Open the envelope, Nathan.
[sigh]
You don't believe him, do you?
Of course, I do.
He's a judge.
Blood's thicker than water.
He wants someone
killed, Nathan.
I know.
I know.
I know.
So why did you take
the envelope then?
You going to do it then?
Nope.
So take the money and run.
Listen.
He trusts me.
OK.
I mean he'd never see me again.
He won't even know I existed.
- Let's do it.
Oh, shut up, Leo.
I'm in a world of shit.
$30 grand would get me out.
If we don't do it,
someone else will.
Oh, come on.
He just got out of the
slammer 10 minutes ago.
You know, cars are
one thing, but--
Maybe it'd be good.
You know, this woman.
You know, to do--
to do justice.
- Oh, we don't know that.
- Look.
He's my dad.
OK.
I can't do nothing.
Open the envelope, Nathan.
Oh, fuck.
Shut up.
Look.
We're not going to
the police, and we're
not going to warn
the woman, because we
don't know what happened.
Do nothing.
Say nothing.
I say open it.
Don't worry about
your conscience.
I'll do it.
He'd never even know.
Besides, it'd make
up for my car.
[sigh]
You're thinking too much.
[inaudible]
Don't fuck around.
Come on.
Relax.
Hey, whoa.
Nathan.
Nathan.
What are you doing?
I don't want it, Leo.
That's money, Nathan.
It's a way out.
No!
No!
God!
NATHAN: I don't want it.
I don't want it.
You fucking idiot!
BRENDA (ON RADIO): And next
up at KWX morning classics,
news and rush hour traffic.
All after the weather
with Mitch Gregson.
MITCH (ON RADIO): A little
cool outside, Brenda, today.
We got winds coming
up at southwest
5 to 15 miles per hour.
This afternoon, it's
going to clear up,
and we are going to have sunny
weather about 65, 70 degrees
today.
But the clouds are going
to come back in tonight.
And we may see
some precipitation.
So make sure to have
your umbrellas near--
No jobs?
I'm looking for
resignations, not jobs.
TANYA: What?
[phone ringing]
Hello.
Hello.
Who was it?
No one.
Tan, I have something
to tell you.
[splash]
TANYA: Wow.
Who was it?
Just a name.
When is the deadline?
Yesterday.
The day before.
It doesn't matter.
He won't resign.
He's called my bluff.
Bastard.
And I don't think I
can go through with it.
Sophie, I don't think
that you want my advice.
I think you just
want me to tell you
that you did the right thing.
Go on then.
Sophie, you did
the right thing.
I've probably given the
guy a hell of a scare.
The worst week of his life.
Still less than he deserves.
I bet he didn't
believe I'd do it anyway.
He said I don't have to
go through any more shit.
Bitch.
Bitch!
[gun clicks]
You're just the bitch.
What's this for?
NATALIE: Now I know
there's something wrong.
When have you ever
needed a reason to drink?
It's probably my
turn to apologize.
I've been very tense
recently, and I know I've
been difficult to live with.
What was it?
A situation at work,
which I handled very badly.
What situation?
It doesn't matter anymore,
because the problem's gone away
and so has my solution for it.
I just don't
understand you sometimes.
I should go.
Therapy.
Couldn't you miss
the shrink for once?
NATALIE: It's boring,
I know, but it's
very good for our marriage.
[groan]
[door slams]
[grunting]
[sigh]
I think he's having an affair.
I don't.
Or a breakdown then.
Something is just not right.
Leo.
You must've been looking
for us everywhere.
This Sophie is so gorgeous,
and smart, and funny.
What I don't get is
what she sees in you.
You know what.
I don't know if she
sees anything in me.
That's why I'm going
back to find out.
It's like you've got
this weird compulsion
of getting your heart broken.
You know what you
should try sometime
is going for a woman who is
actually interested in you.
And what makes you such
a great expert in romance?
Well, the one
advantage of women
never wanting to
go out with you,
you can stay very objective.
I can see things you can't.
- Yeah?
- Yep.
All right.
Here's-- here's
Sophie's number in case
you can't get a hold of me.
And I guess this is it.
- Take care of yourself, Nathan.
- Be good.
You too.
[sniff]
$5,000 isn't enough.
Benny, I'm going to
get the rest tomorrow.
Today.
I'm doing a job, big job.
Benny, please.
Shh.
[music - roy orbison, "crying"]
I thought--
(SINGING) --that
I was over you.
But it's true.
Oh, it's true.
Sing along, Leo.
Benny, I swear.
Sing it.
But darling,
(SINGING) --what can I do?
Louder Leo.
(SINGING) But I
don't know, honey.
And I don't know if--
Benny, please.
Sing it!
(SINGING) Crying over you.
Crying over you.
And--
[gun cocks]
[whimpering] Benny.
Man, I'm cry--
[gun clicks]
Crying.
Last chance.
Don't disappoint me.
OK.
[sniffle] OK.
OK.
Crying over you.
Hey, Leo.
What's going on?
Just a little
singsong with Benny.
Thankfully, he's not
killing me till tomorrow.
Did you give him the 5 thou?
You're not going to do it.
Leo.
I'm dead if don't, Dennis.
What do I care about
some bitch, huh?
Think about it.
She's a bad chick.
- Come on, Leo.
No!
I need this money.
[motorcycle starts]
[phone ringing]
TANYA (ON RECORDING): Hi.
We're not in right now, so leave
us a message after the noise.
[beep]
DENNIS (ON PHONE): Hello.
Th-this is a message for Nathan.
If this is the right number, can
he call-- call Dennis at home?
I-it's an emergency.
[music - lackey, "dilated eyes"]
Give a little space my friend.
A child of God is walking.
Took a little power trip when
he should have [inaudible]..
What did my brother
mean by "wait a while
and let's just see"?
[knock]
Ma'am.
Yeah.
Hi.
Uh, I'm here for number 10,
but they're not in right now.
I was wondering
if you could uh--
could you let me in please.
- Mrs. Gilbert?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
That's her.
Mrs. Gilbert.
Ma'am.
Uh.
She usually gets home
in about half an hour.
I'd like to wait
for her inside.
Tough.
[beep]
SOPHIE'S MOM (ON RECORDING):
Hi, Sophie honey.
It's Mom.
Call me.
DENNIS (ON RECORDING): Th-this
is a message for Nathan.
If this is the right
number, could he call--
call Dennis at home.
I-it's an emergency.
[phone ringing]
NATHAN (ON PHONE): Hello.
Nathan?
SOPHIE (ON PHONE):
Where are you?
Just got back.
I'm about 10 minutes away.
I'm near some bus stop.
Listen.
Can I come over?
[sigh] I'm sorry.
I'm tired.
It's been a long day.
A Dennis called.
Soph-- Sophie.
He said it was an emergency.
He wants you to call him.
Sophie, wait.
Listen.
SOPHIE (ON PHONE):
If you're close by,
could you please drop
off the front door
keys through the mailbox?
[buzzing]
Oh, Christ.
Nathan, I got to go.
Sophie.
Hey, Sophie.
[dial tone humming]
Fuck.
[buzzing]
What?
Excuse me, ma'am.
Uh, I'm still waiting out
here for Mrs. Gilbert.
[laugh] I was
wondering, are you sure?
Could you just let
me in to wait please.
(WHISPERING) Yeah.
I'm sure.
LEO (ON INTERCOM):
Ma'am, I'm uh--
I'm still waiting.
There's a bar
on the next block.
Why don't you wait there?
- Yeah.
I know that, but I
want to come in now.
[phone ringing]
NATHAN (ON PHONE): Dennis.
Leo found the envelope,
the money, the photo.
Nathan, he's gonna do it.
Nathan, do you hear me?
What am I supposed
to do about it?
Huh?
Sophie doesn't want
to see me again.
I got $10 in my pocket.
I got no place to stay, and
frankly, I don't give a shit.
Well, you would if it was
your Sophie getting smoked.
NATHAN (ON PHONE): What
do you mean my Sophie?
All I'm saying is you
should look at it like that.
What are you
talking about, Sophie?
DENNIS (ON PHONE): The
woman's name is Sophie.
That's all.
- Sophie what?
There, you see?
NATHAN (ON PHONE):
Dennis, come on.
Lennon.
Same as John.
Dennis.
DENNIS (ON PHONE): --a-and Yoko.
Are you making this up?
No.
I'm not.
I mean-- I mean
that's what this--
that's the name.
[dial tone humming]
[busy signal beeping]
Shit.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
[phone ringing]
Hello.
SOPHIE'S MOM (ON PHONE): I
don't believe I got you at home.
Hi, Mom.
[busy signal beeping]
[chatter on phone]
[busy signal beeping]
Fuck!
[glass shatters]
[dog barking]
Why don't you leave him?
SOPHIE'S MOM (ON
PHONE): I can't.
Fuck!
You don't have to tell me.
Then, tell me.
All right.
You shouldn't have told me.
SOPHIE'S MOM (ON PHONE):
Honey, what should I do?
No, Mom.
Mom, I got to go.
SOPHIE'S MOM (ON PHONE): What?
You have a date?
No.
I'm taking a bath.
SOPHIE'S MOM (ON PHONE): Honey.
[sirens blaring]
[music playing]
--looking for
someone [inaudible]..
Everyone's looking for
somebody to feel the same.
Everybody's looking
for someone--
Yeah.
Yeah.
[knocking]
- You OK?
- Yes.
Huh?
Yeah.
OK.
All right.
We got to get you out of here.
Why?
I'm not kidding, Sophie.
It's not safe for you here.
What?
What are you doing?
You know him, don't you?
Callum Crane, you know him.
Huh?
Callum Crane.
You know.
- What?
Just tell me the truth.
OK, Sophie.
Just-- just tell me the truth.
What's it to you?
You screwed him, didn't you?
Huh?
You screwed him, and
you wanted money.
Who told you that?
Sophie, listen to me.
Don't touch.
Sophie, just tell
me the truth please.
Then tell me it isn't true.
OK.
Just tell me something.
Just fucking go.
It's true, isn't it?
Get out!
Just tell me the truth.
Fucking get out.
Fuck you!
- Sophie.
Listen, listen.
Wait-- wait a second.
Open the door.
Sophie!
Hey!
Look.
I'm sorry.
It's not safe for you.
You got to open the door.
Please.
[banging]
Open the fucking door, Sophie.
Sophie, I'm sorry.
Sophie!
Listen.
I'm going to be outside.
OK.
Don't open the door
if anybody asks.
All right.
Sophie, please.
Come on.
Fuck!
[creaking]
Fuck.
[door shuts]
[gasp]
[gun cocks]
Hi, bitch.
You are a bitch.
You're a bitch.
Oh shit.
Bitch!
[panting] Here it comes.
[whimper]
[buzzing]
Sophie!
[screaming]
SOPHIE: [scream]
NATALIE: You don't mind?
She's your sister.
Of course, she can stay.
Why do you sound so surprised?
You refer to her as
the Anti-Christ, Callum.
And I've personally heard
you telling her it's
lucky to fly in thunderstorms.
Excuse me.
I'm in a good mood.
- Yay.
Whoa.
Did Faith tell you she
got into drama school?
So my check passed
the audition, huh?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh.
I'm uh-- expecting friends.
You finally bought some.
That's nice.
Let's go get some candy.
You see the news this morning?
- I wasn't in it, was I?
- No.
Well then.
You remember that
secretary we had recently,
the difficult one
that Miles fired.
- What's she done?
- Nothing.
She was battered to death
in her apartment last night.
NATALIE: Oh god.
That's terrible.
Do they know who did it?
BRENT: The cops?
Are you kidding?
They need a diagram to
put spaghetti on a plate.
They're appealing to witnesses.
Any possible leads.
In other words--
Shouting and screaming.
And he kept hammering
on the door,
but she wouldn't let him in.
I wouldn't have either.
Have you seen him before?
I first saw him
about a week ago maybe.
He started sleeping out
in the corridor there.
I didn't like to say anything.
Like I said, he-- he
looked kind of rough.
Do you know his name?
Nathan.
Nathan Corrigan.
He's been sniffing around
Sophie for a while now,
but she never wanted
anything to do with him.
It doesn't surprise
me what he's done.
Doesn't surprise me at all.
[knocking]
LEO: Open up.
Wait up.
LEO: Open it up.
Wait up.
LEO: Come on.
I'm coming.
Hold on.
LEO: Now!
Where is he?
Huh?
Where the fuck is he, Dennis?
Huh?
- I don't know.
Now.
Tell me!
I don't know.
I don't know.
Now!
You tell him I want the rest
of my money or his dad's name.
I don't care which.
You understand?
Good.
[exhales] Thanks.
You can't keep doing this.
You think I don't know that.
Huh?
Why don't you tell
Leo where Crane is
and let him get on with it?
Because Leo ain't
getting a fucking
thing for killing Sophie.
That's why.
Fine.
All right.
What do we do about this?
I got her killed, man.
DENNIS: It wasn't deliberate.
That's between Leo and Crane.
Doesn't matter.
Will you forget all that?
There's no shit you're
not in right now.
You hand yourself in,
and they'll nail you.
You don't, and they'll find you.
You can't give up
your dad or Leo
without giving yourself up too.
And even if you
tried, they're both
going to finger you anyway.
Give me a drag.
So what do you think, huh?
What do you think I'll
get for telling the truth?
15 years for conspiracy
to murder probably.
I don't even know
why she was killed.
What does that matter now?
That's the only
thing that matters now.
[phone ringing]
Hello.
NATHAN (ON PHONE): Let's meet.
I didn't think anything
was going to happen.
I need some time.
NATHAN (ON PHONE): Tonight.
I don't have all the money.
NATHAN (ON PHONE): I said
tonight at the docks.
12 o'clock.
Why'd you want her killed?
We shouldn't be meeting.
Your face is all over the news.
How inconvenient for you.
You don't look happy.
Why aren't you happy?
- You got caught.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
I was, and I didn't even do it.
Why'd you want her killed, huh?
I mean is anything
you told me true?
Take the money and
get out of the country.
I want the truth.
It doesn't matter now.
It does to me.
Yeah.
She wanted to tear
my life apart.
You think I did this for fun?
I want to know everything.
Tell me everything.
You're in trouble.
Take the money.
Oh, "you're."
You see, now, I prefer "we."
It's much more comforting,
all that togetherness.
There's nothing between us.
That was the whole point.
Goodbye.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And if you weren't
my father, well then
you'd get away home free.
What?
May 1975.
Sonic's made it to the playoffs
for the first time ever,
and you get laid by a school
senior named Madeline Tanner.
One night, and here I am.
Here we are.
And that's what I wanted to
say to you, but I got scared.
You stupid--
stupid little shit.
[car starts]
Tanya.
[yelp]
I need your help.
Tanya, wait, wait, wait.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
I didn't do it.
Tanya, it wasn't me.
Tanya, listen to me.
I didn't do it.
Hey.
Give me one good reason
why I should trust you.
There aren't any.
Let's celebrate.
Right.
Anything in particular?
I'm a father.
I suppose when
you think about it,
it's surprising it
doesn't happen more often.
I mean, the number of times
that people stumble into bed
with complete
strangers and never
see them again, especially you.
[sigh] Yeah.
It's amazing.
At the time you never recognize
those tiny, tiny moments which
change your life so completely.
But it makes you
appreciate other things.
Natalie.
And how little time
there is for everything.
And you, I suppose.
Thanks for listening, Brent.
I'll go bore somebody else now.
What is this place?
It's a rental property.
They don't move in until
tomorrow afternoon.
You'll be safe tonight.
Huh.
[sigh]
Why don't you
go to the police?
My prints are all
over the apartment.
Tan, I got a record.
For stealing cars.
I told you.
I don't trust them.
Oh, so you don't trust
them, but I have to trust you.
Is that it?
[sigh] I'm scared, Nathan.
Poor Sophie.
Poor Sophie.
It was just so much.
She didn't deserve this.
[thunder rumbles]
It never would have
worked between you.
Anyway, your timing was off.
She'd just broken
up with someone.
And she was getting over
that, and she lost her job.
And before that--
What?
Before that she was--
Tanya?
She was raped.
I don't know his name.
Someone from the
office, a lawyer.
She was ashamed.
She didn't think that
she could prove it,
so she didn't want
to go to the police.
That won't help poor Sophie now.
You're not telling me
the whole truth, are you?
Well, what happened?
I know that you
didn't kill Sophie.
But you're not
telling me everything.
I don't want to see
you again until you do.
[grunt]
[groan]
I'm the judge now.
You raped her, didn't you?
Huh?
What's it to you?
Tell me!
I regret what happened.
It's a little late for
that now, isn't it?
Why'd you want her dead, huh?
She didn't report you.
She told me she would.
Aren't you sorry?
Huh?
I said I'm sorry.
You can't do it, can you?
What?
You don't think I will.
You think I won't, huh?
You think I care anymore?
Goodbye, Dad.
[grunt]
[groan]
From now on you'll do
everything that I say.
Now, I've addressed this
envelope to the DA's office,
and we'll send this tape unless
you find me a place to hide,
a passport, and a way
out of the country.
So you got until tomorrow.
Who actually killed her?
What does that matter?
This guy Leo.
He used to be a friend of mine.
Well, it's all yours.
[beeping]
[busy signal beeping]
NATALIE: Doesn't it
bother you at all?
Look.
I feel as bad
about it as you do.
It's just not
worth it anymore.
I can't see where it's going.
It's not going anywhere.
It's an affair, not a bus.
For God's sake, Brent.
He really needs
me at the moment.
I don't know why.
Of course, you never do
with him, but he does.
[water running]
[door shuts]
How was therapy?
Exhausting.
CALLUM CRANE: Maybe I
should introduce myself.
I'm Nathan's father.
Who's Leo?
I want to know
where Nathan is.
CALLUM CRANE: He's safe.
And if you want him
to stay that way,
you'll tell me where
I can find Leo.
DENNIS: Last time I heard,
he was looking for you.
CALLUM CRANE: Then help him out.
I'll be at the Queens Hotel.
DENNIS: It won't be easy.
He's had to disappear, you know.
These real heavy
people are after him.
CALLUM CRANE: I'm sure you
can get him the message.
[knocking]
It's open.
I believe you've
been looking for me.
Yeah.
I want the rest of my money.
I gave it to Nathan.
What?
The $25,000.
He told me you two
had an arrangement.
No!
No!
No!
He did not!
I'll kill him.
I will.
I don't think he
understands about business.
Maybe you should just
talk to him yourself.
You know where he is?
[intense music playing]
[chuckle]
[grunting]
Seems I'm not the only one
that wants you dead, Leo.
Who is he?
The guy that told me
to wait here for you.
I'd be interested to know.
Well, you should have chosen
your friends more carefully.
[tap]
[explosion]
Jesus.
You scared the shit out of me.
Come on.
Where we going?
You took the tape.
I want it back.
CALLUM CRANE: We'll
get into that later.
NATHAN: No.
No.
No.
Now.
I'm not giving you a choice.
Running away is never an option.
All you can do is trust me.
[sigh] You got
to be kidding me.
All right.
Say nothing.
I'm going to need 48 hours.
Say nothing to who?
What are you talking about?
Cross the bridge to the plaza.
When the phone rings, answer it.
[birds fluttering]
[phone ringing]
POLICE (ON PHONE): Nathan
Corrigan, this is the police.
[siren blares]
Place your hands
behind your head.
POLICE OFFICER: Get down!
Get down now!
Drop the bag.
On your knees.
Drop the bag.
Do it!
On your knees!
Callum, what are
these doing here?
They're yours.
I know they're mine, but
what are they doing down here?
I was hoping you'd fill
them with your things
and take them away along
with your children.
If your mother can't
fit you in tonight,
please find a hotel and
I'll reimburse your expenses
as part of the settlement.
What are you talking about?
What settlement?
The divorce settlement.
Or will you be
staying with Brent?
It would be cheaper.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be
gone by the time I get back.
You get a confession yet?
We won't need one, sir.
We've got enough forensics
and circumstantial to nail
him dead.
Keep at him.
I'll call the DA.
We'll charge him in the morning.
Phone call, detective.
Apparently, it's urgent.
Caller says he can identify
the real killer, sir.
He says it wasn't Corrigan.
DENNIS: I know it
sounds strange.
It all started with
the photo that Nathan
brought back of Sophie.
The moment Leo saw it.
He was just obsessed.
He-- he couldn't stop talking
about her, saying he was--
he was a-- he was going to
meet this girl and that--
and that she was
too good for Nathan.
And-- and that how
romantic and perfect
it was going to be when he
met her for the first time.
He was totally unreal
about the whole thing.
I don't know.
Personally, I-- I think
he was going really weird.
He had had a lot of trouble,
and these pretty heav--
Go back.
You're losing the story.
Go back to the beginning.
Come on.
You have to know this.
They're going to go over it,
and over it, and over it.
So let's start again
from the beginning.
Why didn't you tell
us all of this before?
DENNIS: When I found the
stuff, the gun and the photo,
and I realized what he
had done, I was scared.
I mean I was really scared.
You didn't know him.
He would have killed me.
And anyway, he was a
friend since high school.
Didn't seem right.
But then when I
heard he was dead,
it didn't seem to
matter anymore.
Leo Kilpatrick, on
bail for possession, GTA,
assault. I won't bother you with
the psychiatric evaluations.
They're taller than my son.
Forensics say the killer
was almost certainly
Kilpatrick, not Corrigan.
Blood under the victim's
nails was Kilpatrick's.
Plus fingerprints on the gun
and photo, which Corrigan
doesn't have.
Plus positive ID of
Kilpatrick's motorcycle
outside the house on the night.
Hm.
What did Tacoma PD say
about the explosion?
Gang killing, drug-related.
They weren't surprised.
POLICE CHIEF: Very
convenient for Corrigan.
It's all too neat.
Yeah.
Well, the people who could
tell us what really happened
are all dead.
Shall we get an
extension, or let him go?
[sigh]
CELL GUARD: Corrigan.
- I'm OK, Ma.
- I know.
I know.
[sigh]
Hey.
How you doing, man?
Good.
Come here.
I'm sorry.
So we'll go home now.
Actually, Ma, I got to
go talk to someone first.
Is that it?
I could have you
sent away, you know.
You, Dennis, Crane, all of you.
I suppose you just
expect me to forgive you.
You know, I don't know
if I forgive myself.
Why tell me now?
You said you
wouldn't see me again
unless I told you the truth.
So what am I suppose to say?
"Don't worry about it.
It could happen to anyone.
Let's go get a pizza?"
It doesn't happen like that.
You know what.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come.
I'm sorry.
[groan] Nathan,
maybe you should
give me your phone number.
You know, in case I want to
call you later and yell at you
some more.
CALLUM CRANE: There are few
crimes more heinous than that
of rape, and you've shown little
or no remorse for the distress
that you've caused
an innocent woman.
I hope that 10 years
in prison will give
you time to change your mind.
Take him away.
[beep]
ANSWERING MACHINE: Message one.
NATHAN (ON RECORDING): It's me.
I uh-- I don't know why
I wanted to call really.
I guess just to say goodbye.
And to ask you a question.
How will you ever be able
to live with yourself?
ANSWERING MACHINE:
1:00 AM, Monday.
Message two.
I sentence you to life.
NATALIE (ON RECORDING): Hi.
I followed your instructions.
I'm at my mother's.
Maybe we can talk.
Anyway, there's
food in the fridge.
And habit, I
suppose, but I mailed
that letter on your desk,
the one to the DA's office.
