SAMURAI REBELLION
Do you want to try, Tatewaki?
Isaburo Sasahara
of the escort group has tested it.
That's enough for me.
I see.
I'll tell the chamberlain
you both approve.
I'd rather see you two duel
than merely test swords.
There are rumors in our clan.
The reason you don't fight
is because it would hurt
the family of the loser.
You both understand that,
and so you avoid a duel.
Be that as it may.
Perhaps protecting your family name
rather than promoting
your pride and rank
is the wisest way
to get along in this world.
Slicing straw dummies
to test our lord's sword.
What peaceful times these are.
Now, now.
Think of it as one of our duties.
Isaburo, you're too attentive
to your superiors.
I'm used to it.
I married into my wife's family
and have been henpecked for 20 years.
Did anything unusual happen?
No, nothing at all.
Would you like to look
at the November border record?
No, not if nothing unusual happened.
I'm returning to the castle
with Sasahara.
Making rice cakes in November
But there are no customers
They're waiting anxiously
for the Inoko festival.
Inoko?
Does that mean the Suwa Shrine
festival begins tomorrow too?
The god who came down in February
and brought the rice harvest
departs tomorrow
until his return next year.
Do you really believe that?
No, I was just -
The hearts of children
are docile and precious.
They sing, believing it.
Perhaps you want a grandchild?
Yes, as soon as I find
a bride for Yogoro.
It isn't settled yet?
No. My wife Suga is the problem.
It must be someone she approves of.
I keep quiet,
but I'd like a nice wife for Yogoro.
Someone strong, loving and faithful.
Is that the steward's?
Yes, he just arrived.
He's been waiting for you.
Making the steward wait.
You were probably
idly chatting away to Asano
about useless things
like martial arts again.
To have the steward honor us
with a visit
has never happened
in the Sasahara family.
The truth is, Isaburo,
Lady Ichi has been
dismissed from the castle.
Lady Ichi?
Yes.
It has been decided
to have her marry Yogoro,
your son.
Steward, why was Lady Ichi dismissed?
She incurred our lord's displeasure.
But he's reluctant
to give her to any man.
You're one of
our lord's cavalry escorts,
and given that your son
is a fine man, he chose him.
I'll return for an answer in a few days.
But Sasahara,
it is our lord's decision,
so bear that in mind.
The steward is leaving!
Why should we accept Lady Ichi?
You should have refused at once.
What was it, of all that happened,
that led our lord to dismiss her?
In the first place, she -
I know.
The daughter
of the keeper of the records -
Everyone knows that.
The reason she was dismissed after
bearing our lord's son, Kikuchiyo -
That's what I want to know.
- Mother, that's -
- You be quiet.
Three men gather in a room
and still have no idea what's going on.
How embarrassing.
It's like this.
After Lady Ichi bore her son Kikuchiyo,
she went to a spa to rest.
When she returned,
she saw Lady Tama with our lord.
The daughter of Gohei Yamagiwa,
the man in charge of the castle wardrobe,
was serving beside him.
Lady Ichi lost her head on seeing this.
She sprang at Lady Tama,
slapped her face,
and dragged her by the hair.
Then she seized our lord
by his garments
and slapped him repeatedly.
A vain, wild woman
who would attack our lord -
How can we accept her?
But, Mother...
I think we should gratefully
accept her without being difficult.
Bunzo!
No matter what you say,
we must accept her.
It's an order from our lord.
I'm afraid...
I don't feel very enthusiastic about it.
Neither do I.
But if I refuse,
there may be trouble later.
Yogoro has said nothing,
but he wouldn't be happy marrying
a lord's mistress who has borne a child.
Marrying unwillingly
and under pressure.
Different circumstances, but much like
my own marriage into the Sasahara family.
I don't want him
to repeat my mistake.
Sasahara!
Isaburo,
I didn't find you at your office.
They said you'd be at the border.
I'm glad I found you.
I heard everything.
The steward and chamberlain
are good judges.
Alert even in times of peace.
It's an honor that a member
of our group has been chosen.
But, Isaburo...
as for the marriage and other matters,
I suggest you keep things quiet.
You'll probably receive a larger fief.
So be modest about it or the others
will think you're showing off.
Understand?
Anyway, I congratulate you.
A happy event.
What nerve.
He's not thinking of you
or your family.
Only outward appearance
and influence matter with him.
Will you draw on your secret principles
of swordplay?
Push and you step back.
Push further,
and you step back further.
But at the last moment,
you skillfully switch
from defense to offense.
Yet you never attack.
You wait until your opponent tires.
In other words, until he gives up.
Unworthy?
Yes.
We cannot accept
our lord's favored lady.
There's no need to be so reserved.
It's happened before,
not just in the Aizu clan,
but in every clan.
I'm well aware of that,
but even so, I wish to decline the honor.
Decline?
Sasahara, that will not be allowed.
It is our lord's personal wish.
You'd -
I mean no disrespect.
We are not worthy of such an honor.
You know our lord's wish.
It's an order!
I would never disobey him,
but if I may decline...
What?
To decline is to defy the order!
No, I'd never do that.
It's just that
we're unworthy of the honor.
Sasahara.
You refuse to agree to it?
It's not about
agreeing or disagreeing.
We are unworthy of the honor.
What? You continue saying that?
Father,
I wish to accept the honor.
What?
Young men seem to be
more understanding.
I don't know what use it is
to think only of martial arts.
Isaburo Sasahara,
you seem a bit too stubborn.
May you enjoy long life together
We'll all be at your side
as long as you live
This is a day of celebration
Let our spirits
celebrate this happiness
I am not very competent,
but I hope you will be good to me.
You may have been
our lord's lady once,
but you have now married
into the Sasahara family.
Keep that in mind.
Suga, you needn't -
No. I must say it in order
to keep discipline in our home.
A woman who was dismissed
after bearing a child.
Pampering her would spoil her.
Welcome back.
I'm sorry I didn't notice your return.
It's all right.
Where's Nui?
Mother took her along
for prayer at Shonenji Temple.
Where's Father?
He came home about an hour ago,
when his duties were done.
Ichi.
Mother may say things to offend you,
but don't mind her.
No, she doesn't offend me.
She kindly teaches me
domestic duties.
I don't believe it.
If things grow disagreeable
and hard to bear,
think of Father.
Father?
Father finds
the way Mother thinks and talks
disagreeable.
But despite that,
he has borne everything for 20 years.
Ichi, is dinner ready?
Yes, right away.
A bottle of sake tonight as well.
While the cat's away.
You mustn't.
If she'd just change a little,
all would be well.
The world never seems to go right.
"I wish to retire
and have Yogoro,
my eldest son, succeed me.
I humbly hope that
my request will be granted."
Sasahara,
how are your son and his bride doing?
Very well, I'm happy to say.
You made such a fuss about this
in the beginning,
but now it's all going very well?
I'm very sorry.
It's too early to retire, I think,
but his son has married, so -
All right.
We'll ask the steward
to enquire of our lord.
It won't take long
to obtain his approval.
So Isaburo Sasahara's retiring at last?
I didn't realize it at the time,
but it's a great relief.
At the same time,
it's a Ionely feeling.
I wonder what I've done all my life,
though it's not like me to do so.
Yogoro's marriage is
a very happy one.
Perhaps life will be a little better
for our children.
At least Yogoro's better off than me.
Fear often exceeds the perceived danger.
So it was in your case.
Yogoro's wife.
She's a fine wife.
I thought she'd be like a cannon,
ready to go off at any time.
But I was very wrong.
Suga's just the same as before,
but Ichi is always pleasant
and never talks back.
I don't understand.
Why did she attack our lord then?
Like yourself,
I don't understand it either.
As I've said,
your duties won't be difficult.
Check the weapons in the armory
against the inventory list,
and have the men clean them
on appointed days.
That's about all.
It's harder to get along
with our superiors and fellow vassals.
I don't say to always yield to them,
but at times, they're unreasonable.
If you get angry at them every time,
you won't last.
Pardon me.
Rice cakes?
They look good.
Yes. Enjoy.
Wait, Ichi.
I'm going to retire soon.
Yogoro will become
the head of our family,
and you're his wife.
You needn't hold back
for the old woman.
Take over the household duties.
Understand?
Even so, she is my mother,
and I will treat her as such.
Excuse me.
That's enough
about your duties, Yogoro.
How about some rice cakes?
But I don't understand.
Well...
it's almost beyond belief
that she'd grasp her lord
by his clothing.
It was hard for me to believe too,
so I asked her the other day.
Her face became very sad
as she told me the story.
I was 19
when I went to serve my lord.
It was the year before last.
Ichi.
Actually,
there is a reason the steward
has come to see me.
You have found favor
in our lord's eyes
and are to serve him.
Accept the honor gratefully.
The sudden news
must have surprised you.
I was more angry than surprised.
Angry?
A man over 50 was infatuated with me.
I felt as if a hairy worm
were crawling over me.
I shuddered.
And then?
Our lord does not do this
just to satisfy a whim.
Daimyo must have heirs
or their houses will be abolished.
The only heir to our lord right now
is young Lord Masamoto.
Should anything happen...
Even so, Miss Ichi,
not just anyone
can become our lord's mistress,
for her son may one day
become our lord's heir.
She must be
beautiful and kind like you.
I am afraid
I must decline the position.
You are referring
to Sannojo Kasai, your fiancé?
Kasai?
Yes.
Our parents arranged our engagement.
Then if Sannojo agrees,
you will gratefully agree
to serve our lord?
What do you say?
I couldn't imagine Sannojo doing it.
But he bowed to our lord's wishes
and gave you up?
Yes.
So you had no choice?
I still did not wish to go.
So I withheld my answer.
Don't bother me!
Leave now!
No.
I will not leave until I see Sannojo.
You said you would serve our lord
if Sannojo agreed.
He has clearly agreed to it.
As summoned,
Hyoemon Shiomi's daughter Ichi
is here in answer to your wishes.
It was like dragging
a pure silk kimono through the mud.
Then I thought -
No, it was more like a prayer.
I made up my mind.
I would bear him sons.
Many, many sons.
Then other girls need never know
my misery. It would end with me.
It was like a prayer.
My thoughts were really
like a prayer.
With this prayer,
I bore Kikuchiyo a year later.
Then I went to a spa
for postnatal rest
at my lord's orders.
When I returned to the castle -
Ichi, this is Lady Tama.
Be friends with her.
It wasn't jealousy!
On the face of his new young mistress,
there was not even
a trace of humility.
I hated her for it.
She was proud as a peacock -
glad to be a mistress.
Beast!
Beast!
Thanks to his
displeasure toward you,
I have become a happy man.
I could never have found
a better wife.
Beginning tonight,
I will forget my son.
What?
Our lord means nothing to me.
But...
I have been so worried
about the son I bore.
So worried.
Beginning now...
I will forget about him too.
I will forget him.
Yogoro,
be good to Ichi.
You're a lucky man.
There's no other wife like her.
A couple without children
lacks binding ties.
You've made me wait nearly two years,
but at last.
A boy would have been better.
We mustn't ask for too much.
And what's her name?
Yogoro and I racked
our poor brains over this
and named her Tomi.
Post-horse messenger!
Ryuzo Komiya here from Edo
on an urgent mission!
What?
Young Lord Masamoto died of illness?
Yes!
He was resting from a cold
he caught on the 12th.
But his condition grew worse.
At 2:00 in the morning,
he passed away.
It's a lucky thing.
What?
It's the death of the heir.
But the Matsudaira house
will not be abolished.
There is young Lord Kikuchiyo,
the son of Shiomi's daughter.
But Sasahara,
Lord Kikuchiyo has become
our lord's heir.
So Ichi is birth mother to the heir.
If she remains the wife of a vassal,
there would be much talk.
You say this is our lord's wish?
Yes.
And our chamberlain here
and the Edo chamberlain agree.
Please consider it
before formal orders come.
The best thing is for Yogoro
to submit a request to our lord
and say he will send Ichi
back to the castle.
Has Yogoro been told already?
I've been at him
since the day before yesterday,
but he refuses.
Naturally.
They have a baby daughter, Tomi.
Well, I don't blame him.
Emotionally it is intolerable.
The chamberlain
and steward know that.
But you know very well...
that we can't have all our wishes
granted in this world.
So...
you're telling me
to make Yogoro agree to it?
I'm asking you
to submit a voluntary request
rather than making us
order her back.
You must see the difference.
What's the matter, Ichi?
You're pale. Are you sick?
Group Head Kotani
came over in the afternoon.
I feel...
more resentful than grateful...
for your consideration.
I'm sorry, Ichi.
I didn't mean to hide it.
But I couldn't bring myself
to tell you.
Brother.
Father is calling you.
What are the men talking about?
I'm not sure.
Acting as if
some crisis has occurred
and hiding it from me.
Tell them to talk at night
after they dine!
Ichi, I must tell you something.
Come into the room.
First, Father's words.
He says he's retired,
so I am the family head,
and I am to do
what I think is right.
However, he also says
you're too important to us
to send away.
That we must take
the best possible care of you.
Mother doesn't seem to know
anything about this yet.
I must tell her sooner or later.
Don't worry.
No matter what anyone says,
I will not send you
back to the castle.
For Tomi's sake too.
It may be our lord's wish,
but he is being too selfish.
Ichi is not a doll.
She is a living being.
Yes, you're right.
You're young.
And I don't blame you.
But you can't reason with a crying child
nor with your lord, as they say.
Isaburo, what's your opinion?
I have none.
Yogoro is head
of the Sasahara family now.
It's all up to him.
But I would like to say one thing.
What is it?
When we accepted Lady Ichi
into our house,
it was Steward Takahashi that came.
I'd like him to come again now
and explain in his words
why we must return her.
If only he could!
But it would attract
too much attention.
These are our lord's orders, Isaburo!
Well, I want my lord
to explain his orders to me.
When his son's mother
proves inconvenient,
he forces her to marry a vassal.
Inconvenienced once again,
he demands her return.
This is cruel and unreasonable.
He has no understanding
of human emotions.
No understanding
of human emotions?
Kotani-san,
our family didn't accept Ichi
particularly gratefully.
Nor did Ichi herself know Yogoro
or the Sasahara family.
She was none too happy
about it either.
But the reason
they are getting along
is because they're kind to each other
and care for each other.
I understand all that clearly enough.
But Isaburo,
if you continue to be so stubborn,
who knows
what might happen to your family.
I don't care.
I will not return Ichi,
even if the heavens rain fire!
What?
Even if the heavens rain fire...
and blood?
Wait, Yogoro.
Watch your language!
Kotani-san,
I think this is enough for today.
I beg you.
You should understand, Mother,
being a woman yourself.
If you were in her place,
what would you do?
Would you give up Tomi
and return to the castle?
Enough!
Would you ruin our family because
you've lost your head over a woman?
In this case -
In this case, it may be unavoidable.
Brother!
You truly don't care
if you ruin our family?
- I am.
- What?
Bunzo, if you were me,
would you return Ichi?
Of course I would!
You're too attached to her, brother!
Restrain yourself, Bunzo.
Yogoro's the head of the family.
Right or wrong, it's all up to him.
Be patient.
Don't lose hope.
If you love Yogoro and Tomi,
be prepared to defy such senseless
conventions, however hard it may be.
I believe that, if worst comes to worst,
you are a wife worth protecting,
even if that means
ruining our family.
I am not worthy of it.
But this won't be the end of it.
I gave her the message.
She will be here soon.
Over here, sister.
We've heard all about
what has happened.
We relatives and the Sasahara family
have discussed what to do.
We've spoken to Yogoro
and know exactly how he feels.
Thus we have come to the conclusion
that the rest is up to you.
We'd like to know
how you feel about it.
Do you want to stay with Yogoro,
even if it means
ruining the Sasahara family?
Answer us, Ichi!
I would like to stay.
Even if you ruin the family?
Yes.
Ichi.
Your father, Hyoemon Shiomi,
has asked our lord
that you be sent back to the castle
as soon as possible.
I'm sure you're aware of that.
Not only that.
He lies in wait when Yogoro
travels to and from the castle
to plead with him to send you back.
He's done this several times.
Father is Father. I am me.
I would rather die than return.
Please tell the chamberlains
and steward how I feel
in whatever words
you think will best help my case.
If we could do that,
we wouldn't be here like this!
We ask you again, Ichi!
Your desire to stay
with Yogoro is final?
The family doesn't matter?
Not only the Sasahara family,
but we the relatives
will be jeopardized as well.
You still don't care?
It cannot be helped.
I see.
There's no use trying
to convince a woman like this.
You should give up, Suga.
Yogoro's to blame too.
It's your misfortune that
a woman like her has favored you.
Yogoro, you needn't
hold back anymore.
You two go ahead
and ruin your family!
We must prepare
for our involvement as well!
Completely impervious to reason.
No wonder you attacked our lord!
Ichi, I'm sorry.
Return.
Return to the castle.
Fool!
Why do you say that now?
What's the Sasahara family to you?
What are your relatives' troubles to you?
Yogoro,
have you decided
you want to keep your position?
Listen to me.
My father-in-law was impressed
with my swordsmanship.
As head of the Sasahara,
he asked me to marry into the family.
But otherwise I have no talents.
In other words, I'm a worthless,
good-for-nothing man.
So in order to prove myself,
for these past 20 years
I have fought to preserve
our good name and social standing.
So why am I so obstinate now?
The cruel injustice involved,
for one thing.
But your beautiful love
for each other
has touched me most of all.
There's never been
a shred of love in my married life!
And now you do this!
Promise me, Yogoro,
that you'll never let Ichi go!
You too.
No matter what happens,
never leave him!
Promise me, both of you!
My husband's with the chamberlain?
Yes, and he's waiting
for you to come.
I saw him in the castle.
He said he'd be
at the chamberlain's residence
and that you must come at once.
The chamberlain wishes to see you both.
He has some questions for you.
But what about Tomi?
You needn't worry.
It won't take long.
I will accompany you.
My brother's waiting.
Make yourself clear,
as you did with our relatives.
Sister!
If you lose heart now,
what will it mean for my brother?
Even if it is the chamberlain,
show him how determined
you both are to keep your resolve.
Hurry!
Sister.
Father, where did you go today?
To see Tatewaki.
Anything new at the castle?
No, nothing yet.
At this rate, perhaps -
I hope nothing happens.
Why is Tomi crying like that?
Where's Ichi?
- She went out.
- Out?
To the chamberlain's residence,
at about 2:00.
What?
The chamberlain's residence?
Mother.
Where's Ichi?
What happened to Ichi?
Where's Bunzo?
Bunzo, where's Ichi?
What's happened to Ichi?
Mother wouldn't say anything.
But Sahei and Nui say you took her
to the chamberlain's residence.
I'm asking you about Ichi!
As a matter of fact -
Bunzo,
you tricked her.
How many times
must we tell you, Ichi?
We had no choice.
No matter
how many times I'm told,
I do not understand.
What?
My husband, child and father
must be worried about me.
I'm going home.
Wait, Ichi!
If she doesn't agree
to our requests
and still insists on going home,
then she may do so.
Provided that
she's willing to have Yogoro Sasahara
and his father, Isaburo,
commit seppuku.
Ichi, take my advice
and return to the castle.
If you go back to the castle
obediently without making a fuss,
the chamberlain is willing
to overlook everything.
But if you insist on returning home,
not only will Yogoro,
but also his father, Isaburo,
be ordered to commit seppuku
for lax supervision of their home.
Honorable Lady Ichi,
please return to the castle.
You say you're the wife
of footman Bansaku Kariya?
Yes.
My name is Kiku.
The chamberlain's orders?
What orders?
He said to come here
every morning and evening
to breast-feed your daughter Tomi.
I want no charity.
Go home!
But...
if I go home without -
Say no more! Go home!
- But -
- Do as I say!
Wait!
Fool.
Tomi, you fool.
How can you be so happy
at a strange woman's breast?
Tomi, you fool.
Yogoro.
Starting tomorrow,
do not report to the castle for duty!
I've already
prepared myself for that.
How's Yogoro?
He hasn't reported for duty
since these events.
But he did request time off
due to illness.
And Tomi?
The chamberlain ordered
the wife of footman Bansaku Kariya
to come and feed her twice a day.
She's healthy and reliable.
A good, solid woman.
Then everything's all over?
Yes.
Certainly since Ichi
has returned to the castle.
In the end, we had no choice
but to have it this way.
We just took a roundabout path.
Defying the clan gets us nowhere.
Isaburo,
do you really mean that?
I came to make sure
of your thoughts on this matter.
And now,
I hope you'll forget everything.
Give it up at once.
To be honest,
the clan's treatment of your family
and your attitude in response
have weighed on my mind.
Weighed on your mind?
It's like your swordplay.
Pushed, you step back.
Pushed again, you retreat further.
But it's not like you to give up.
The clan didn't ask for her formally.
It was more like force.
In fact, it was more like kidnapping.
They took a vassal's wife.
If the shogunate officials in Edo
hear of it, or even the daimyo,
it may prove a fatal mistake
for the Matsudaira.
I can't imagine
things will end like this.
That you'll allow them to end here.
I really don't think so.
You're saying I must formally
ask the castle to take her back?
That is all we can do.
It's for the sake
of the Sasahara family.
They've committed an outrage!
Yet I must ask them
to take her back?
We're asking you.
And I do understand
how you feel.
I was quite afraid you'd storm
the chamberlain's residence.
It was wise of you to hold back.
The chamberlain and steward
are impressed by your restraint.
So if you send them your request -
I refuse!
I don't remember
sending her back to the castle.
Yogoro.
It's all over now.
Why don't you do as he says?
That's ridiculous, Father!
Never!
Think of Ichi.
She suppressed her tears,
left everything behind,
and quietly returned to the castle.
If I were to think of Ichi,
how could I possibly give up on her?
Yogoro,
that's like calling a doctor
for the dead.
What did you say?
Now, now, Yogoro.
Yogoro's young yet.
Isaburo, talk to him
until he understands.
It's all for the sake of your family.
It's not only for my family,
but for yours too,
and the rest of our kin.
In any case, please go for now.
Yogoro will be hard to convince,
but I'll talk to him.
Give me a few days.
Yogoro will report today
and say he wishes to return her?
Yes.
That's wonderful.
Thank you for your trouble.
All has turned out well in the end.
Now we can look forward
to the Suwa Shrine festival tomorrow.
Tomorrow is the Inoko festival?
Since it would have
come to this anyway,
how dare they cause all that fuss!
Yogoro was wrong,
but Isaburo was insolent as well.
Yes.
He's always henpecked by his wife.
And defying clan orders like that -
I must say
he seems like a different man.
It's settled now,
so we needn't criticize him.
His conduct has been admirable.
It calls for
a slight increase in his fief.
Yogoro Sasahara
of the escort group has arrived!
I'm glad you've reported for duty.
We heard you were sick.
Are you well now?
Yes, completely well.
And so?
Taking into consideration
my father's wishes, I have decided.
Please accept this.
That's good of you.
Thank you.
Fool!
What's gotten into you?
"Petition.
Ichi, the wife of
my eldest son Yogoro,
was unlawfully kidnapped
and forced to return to the castle.
This is the cruelest form of tyranny.
It runs counter
to the laws of humanity
and cannot be
condoned by the heavens.
We hereby appeal
for her immediate return.
If our petition is refused,
this shameless act of tyranny
on the part of Masakata Matsudaira,
lord of the Aizu domain,
and his retainers
shall be made known
throughout Japan's 60 provinces.
November 18th, 1727, 2:00.
Isaburo Sasahara, Aizu clansman."
A word of caution.
Someone may use
my father's name or my own
to submit a request
to return Ichi to the castle.
But it will not be from us.
It will be a false request.
Please keep that in mind.
Excuse me.
Thank you for coming every day.
With the Inoko festival starting tomorrow,
you must be busy.
Master.
We're just airing the house out a bit.
But -
The mats?
It's a custom at times like these.
So our feet won't slip in the blood.
Tomi's been waiting for you.
Let her drink her fill.
This may be the last time.
Will you do me a favor?
Will you cook the rice
after you feed Tomi?
I dismissed all our servants.
I also sent Suga and Bunzo away
so we'd have a little more room.
Just cook the rice.
We'll make the rice balls ourselves.
Can't fight on an empty stomach.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Orders from our lord!
Accept obediently!
I said orders from our lord!
Will you not obey?
It's too late for orders now!
Now, now, Yogoro.
Let's hear what the orders are.
Orders!
Isaburo and Yogoro Sasahara,
for your insolent conduct
and defiance toward our lord,
you are ordered to commit seppuku.
Seppuku?
It is gracious of our lord
to permit it.
I thought men would come arrest us
and then either hang or crucify us.
We will bravely commit seppuku.
Father.
However,
we want something
before we kill ourselves.
Bring us three heads!
What?
Those of Lord Masakata Matsudaira,
ruler of the Aizu domain,
Chamberlain Yanase,
and Steward Takahashi.
Bring me the heads of the villains
who took my son's wife!
You!
Vassal Tatewaki Asano in charge
of boundary gates has arrived!
Tatewaki, I called you
for nothing other than this.
Prepare at once to kill
Isaburo and Yogoro Sasahara.
I hear you are
Isaburo's only equal
as a swordsman.
If you think he's too much for you,
take four or five
strong men with you.
This is a strange request.
What?
The Sasaharas
have defied clan orders.
Are they not now criminals
in the eyes of our clan?
Yes.
Then it's the superintendent's duty
to arrest them.
I'm in charge of border gates.
In other words,
my duty is to keep track of those
leaving or entering our land.
Since when have I become
a superintendent?
This is no time to discuss jurisdiction.
You're wrong.
The trouble began in an attempt
to adhere to daimyo rules
stating that the mother
of our lord's heir
must not remain a vassal's wife.
We must follow the rules.
If you order me to kill them,
please promote me
to superintendent here and now
and obtain our lord's promise
to increase my fief to 500 koku,
according to clan rules.
Tatewaki.
You've gone too far.
Why be so formal now?
Never mind. Go!
We must gather men,
use force and kill them.
Get ready.
A foolish idea.
What?
Isaburo's a swordsman without peer.
You'll only make more trouble
by sending men.
In order to settle matters quietly,
send Lady Ichi back to the Sasahara family
for now, and then later -
What?
Don't talk nonsense!
But Chamberlain,
resort to violence and you'll have
mountains of dead and wounded men.
Cold, isn't it?
What time is it?
Past 9:00, I think.
Eat in moderation.
That should be enough for you.
Someone's coming.
From the footsteps, he's alone.
It's Bunzo.
Don't just stand there.
Come around here!
Father!
Don't talk.
I know what you want to say.
Now, come in.
Father!
Come in, Bunzo.
Father!
Is it nice and cozy
at Kenmotsu's place?
Have a drink.
Listen to the festival drums.
Father!
I know what you want to say.
You were pressed by our relatives
at Kenmotsu's place
to come here
as their messenger and say,
"We've defied our lord long enough.
Now obey clan orders
with good grace."
Father.
Have a drink.
Bunzo, don't hate us.
Not only you and Mother
will be punished, but our kin too,
for being related
to such reckless men.
Father.
But remember:
Each must live his own life.
As for what happened,
I don't blame you and Suga
for what you did,
nor do I bear you any grudge.
Each must live his own life.
Have a drink and then go back.
And tell everyone this for me:
I, Isaburo Sasahara, in all my life
have never felt
more alive than I do now.
Prepare for our lord's entrance!
Haven't you taken
care of Sasahara yet?
What are you doing?
A mere clansman has defied me
and the entire clan.
What if other clans hear of this,
Sanzaemon?
Gather some men
and take care of it yourself.
Before dawn.
- Yes, but -
- What?
The chamberlain's intervention
would aggravate matters.
Please allow me.
You'll go, Geki?
Father, the drum
from the Suwa Shrine has stopped.
It's late. They're probably
done for the night.
Two years ago today,
we were asked to accept Ichi.
I remember it too.
Outside the castle, it was the Inoko
festival, when the harvest god left.
Inside the castle, it was the day
before the Suwa Shrine festival.
Father.
I may seem unmanly -
What is it?
For some reason,
I am more worried...
about Ichi's future than Tomi's.
That's as it should be.
It's not unmanly at all.
Your feelings for each other
gave me new life.
But Yogoro,
don't be too worried about Ichi.
We will die here,
but she is the mother
of our lord's heir.
No one can torture her,
and no one will endanger her life.
But Father,
aren't they late in coming?
I meant to ask
for permission to enter,
but the gate was open, so I came in.
Forgive me.
I will now convey our lord's orders.
We have heard of the order
to commit seppuku.
No.
He changed his orders.
Isaburo and Yogoro Sasahara,
for your insolence
and attitude toward our lord,
you will be confined
at Enshoji Temple outside the castle.
A very light punishment
compared to seppuku.
Why the sudden change?
Lady Ichi,
the mother of our lord's heir,
was once a family member here.
She pleaded with our lord
to save your lives.
Will you gratefully accept
our lord's new orders?
No.
No, he's wrong!
As Yogoro Sasahara's wife,
I appealed through the chief maid,
Yoshino, to my lord
to save my father and husband.
It was not as the heir's mother.
I am...
I am still the wife
of Yogoro Sasahara.
To tell you the truth,
what Lady Ichi says is correct.
But our lord received me
in his audience.
If she appeals to save you
as the heir's mother,
not as Yogoro's wife,
he promised to change his orders
from seppuku to confinement.
I don't understand
what this is all about.
Neither do I.
Steward,
it seems we don't understand
what you just told us.
It's very simple.
If you two admit that
Ichi is no longer a family member
and that she has been returned,
our lord will listen to her plea
for a lighter punishment.
Will you acknowledge
her return and live,
or refuse and fight it out?
Which will it be?
In that case,
we ask for no mercy.
We are prepared for the worst.
Then there is no alternative?
None.
It's all of you who cannot
be pardoned,
who are holding
Yogoro's wife as prisoner
and still insist on doing so.
Please return her at once!
All right.
You've made yourselves very clear.
I'll ask Lady Ichi now.
Lady Ichi,
will you save the lives of these men?
Or will you let their pursuers
come and kill them?
Lady Ichi,
the Sasaharas are men.
Their pride will not
let them back down.
But your position is different.
You have already
returned to serve our lord.
If you tell them
that you sever your ties with them
once and for all,
then all will be well!
Is that clear?
If you do,
their lives will be saved.
We need not ask them to return you.
And even though
they petition for your return,
it can be disregarded
as long as you sever your ties with them.
Wait!
Don't move!
Don't move.
If you do,
unexpected accidents may occur.
Lady Ichi,
will you sever your ties with them
and save their lives?
Or will you let them die as traitors?
What will your answer be?
Lady Ichi,
does your silence mean
you will do as I say?
Am I correct?
No.
I -
What will you do then?
Kill them!
Father.
Yogoro!
Father...
Tomi,
bid your father and mother farewell.
Have a good look at them.
They are your father and mother.
Let us who are still alive
listen to them.
Let's listen to what
they want us to do.
No, I know without being told.
I know how they felt
about their plight and their death.
They want us to tell the world
of our clan's cruelty!
Very well. I understand.
We promise to do that for you.
We'll topple the Aizu clan
from its pedestal!
First, Tomi and I will go
to Edo together
and see the shogunate elders.
We'll leave immediately for Edo.
Isaburo Sasahara
of the escort group...
where are you going?
Tomi and I are going to Edo.
If this is for the clan,
show me your pass.
If it's private business,
show me the clan ticket.
I have neither.
Then I'm afraid
I cannot let you pass.
We must go to Edo
though we have no permit.
You mean to
pass from this domain
without having either?
Yes.
To carry out my duty
and uphold my honor as a samurai,
I must forbid it.
If you insist on breaking our law
and passing through this gate,
I must stop you
at the risk of my life.
That can't be helped.
She is very quiet.
I'd like to put her in the house
away from the wind.
But men we dislike are in there.
Venomous men.
I fed her before dawn.
I don't think she's hungry.
But I'll give the poor thing
a little more.
Before feeding babies rice,
we're supposed to wait
100 days after birth...
when enough teeth have come in.
But I'll do it now.
Tomi, here.
All the family members are supposed
to celebrate this day together
with red bean rice and live fish.
That's impossible now.
We'll make do with this.
You be quiet now, Tomi.
Don't cry even if I don't return.
In that case,
he will become your foster father
and raise you.
Well, then.
Lose this duel. Let me remain.
It's better that way.
What?
Isaburo,
lose to me.
For Tomi's sake.
No.
No matter how strong you are,
how perfect your defense,
I'll defeat you
and go to Edo with Tomi.
Then...
I will win.
Without fail.
I will win without fail.
Tatewaki!
Three people helped you.
Yogoro, Ichi and Tomi.
I had no chance of winning.
Hurry.
Take Tomi with you to Edo.
Tatewaki!
We can't go to Edo anymore!
We can't go to Edo anymore.
No one will ever know the story
of your father and mother now.
Tomi, it can't be helped.
But let me say one word.
Just one word.
When you grow up,
become a woman
just like your mother.
And marry a man
just like your father.
Be sure to do that.
Marry a man just like your father.
THE END
