Hi, Tammy.

She'll like me even more
when she sees me in a football uniform.
- Football uniform?
What are you talking about?
- Women dig football players,
- so I'm going out for the team.
- You're kidding, right?
No. I've been working out
all summer.

Oh, good. Okay, okay.

Spinal column feels right.
No slipped disks.
Muscle tone is good.
Yeah. Your dog
could run a marathon.
Or play basketball.
[ Groans ]
Play basketball?
That's a good one.
Looks like Buddy's due
for his distemper shot.
Oh, uh, you might
want to use the straps.
Buddy's not ver ygood

- Oh, I don't think he's going anywhere.

But look.
I brought you the Amazing Mortimer.

- Watch this.
- Ooh!

[ Cackling ]
So. We go back
to Russia now?
No! My circus
is not complete.
We still need to find
a main attraction.
There has been another in a series
Of animal abductions.
A prize chimpanzee was stolen
from a home in downtown Seattle.
Police are baffled
as to the motive.
All right. Time now
for something special.
...Number one circus in Russia.
Do you know why?
Move aside, Air Jordan,
and make way for Air Bud,
the newest top dog in basketball.
- During yesterday's game,
- We have to find
the perfect creature!
...Stole his way onto the court
and into our Play of the Week.
- Take a look.
- [People Cheering]
- What's this?
- [ Chittering ]

He's good!
What do you think,
Mortimer, huh?
We have found
our main attraction.
Food. Yes.
There we go.
What about this?

So, uh, who was that
on the phone?
Oh, that was, um,
just a guy from work. Herb.
Oh. What did he want?
Well, he wanted to know
if he could take me to the movies.
So it's a date?
Does it weird you out?
No. Doesn't matter.
You should go on a date, Mom.
Oh, mayonnaise.

I was expecting jackie Framm,
not Cindy Crawford.
I don't know. You know,
I'm not just thinking about myself.
I'm also thinking
About Josh and Andrea.
Maybe it's too soon
for me to be dating.
Do you think
it's too soon?
[ Sighs ]

When doggy gets close,

- You back up Cole Powers

He's the hottest quarterback
in the league right now.
You might not get much playing time.
- Oh. That's okay.

He's probably got a woman

We'll just go in there
and check it out, all right?
- Whatever.
-[Patrick]
What seems to be the trouble?
- His tail bone.
- His hip bone.
- Which is it?
- Mm, his tail.
You know, the bone
in his tail.
Yeah, you know, his tail, it just hasn't
been it self lately, you know?
Mm, you know, no wag.
No wag?
Well, yeah, I mean,
there's something wrong
with a tail that doesn't wag.
Yeah. Exactly.
Yeah, so, uh--
Oh, um--
Well, you see,
Tom and I kind of figured out...
that-that it only wags
when he's lying down.
[Tom]Not when he's standing.
You know what I mean?
Hmm. Well, it, uh,
looks fine to me,
but if it'll make
you boys feel better,
uh, I'll get it x-rayed
just to make sure.
- Oh, great.
- Good idea.
Come on, Buddy.
I'll be right back.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Tom--
I don't feel right about this.
I mean--
What are you looking for,
anyways?
Anything that'll show that this guy's
a roaming Romeo.
I mean, this is a waste of time.
I mean, he's gonna catch us.

- Rah, rah, rah!
-[Whistle Blows]
Ahh! We're gonna kick
some Ram butt today. I can feel it.
[ Screams ]
Since when are you
Mr. Confident?
Since I got my hands
on a genuine Jerry Rice nose-spreader.
-[Fanelli]Come on, now.
Hit some body out there.
- Okay, Coach. No problem.
I don't want to see
a green shirt standin; all right?
Let's go, offense!
All right, Josh.
You know what to do.
Hey, Buddy, just like
we practiced. Let's go.
-[Pepper]Kick it, girls.

Navy blue and gold!
[Josh ] All right, guys.

Move, get off!.
Hey, get off. Get off now.
[ Whimpering ]
[ Blows Whistle ]
Aah! [ Muttering ]
That is one talented dog.
You're doing fine,
too, josh, you know?
You just need to face up
to the pressure...
and not desert
the pocket too early.
I found these
in your office.
Who are they?
Well,
that's Laura,
she lives in Seattle.
And that's Gail,
she's in Santa Fe.
And the pretty one with the red hair,
that's Shannon Marie.
- She's in Boston.
- So--
And this is a picture
Of the whole Sullivan clan.
- You see, there's Mom
and Dad and me and--
- Your three sisters.
You know, Josh,
I think we could be friends.
First we gotta learn
to trust each other.
[ Scoffs ]
Broken tail.
[Door Closes]
Oh, Patrick,
this is so romantic.
If I didn't have to fix the engine,
we could have been--
No, l-l think
this is perfect.
- [ Sighs ]
- What's wrong?
Well, I've been offered...
a permanent job
in San Diego.
But I don't know
If I'm going to accept it.
Oh.
I-l don't want
to complicate things for you.
But I will if you insist.
[ Giggles ]
[ Chuckles ]
I think Josh would be
very happy...
to see me leave town.
Well, in lieu of growing
fur and a tail,
for now, just be his friend.
All right, gimme hands. Gimme hands.
How we gonna play?
Ruff, ruff, ruff!.
- How are we gonna play? Let's get 'em!
- Ruff, ruff, ruff!.
[ Cheering, Screaming ]
- [ Blows Whistle ]
- [ Cheering ]
[josh]
Twenty-five! Down!
Set, hut!
Yes!
So you run X-curl, and Buddy
in the deep fly pattern.
Straight up the middle.
Better known as the K-9knockout.
This is the one
For all the marbles.
'Cause after that, I want to do
a couple of motion things--
[Whistle Blows]
[ Shouting ]
- Yes!
- [ Cheering ]
Yes, yes!
We did it!
Come here, Pudgy!
We did it!
We did it!
When Josh threw that pass
to Buddy and he scored the home run,
- Touchdown.
- I thought I was gonna have
a heart attack.
- Oh, football is so dramatic, yeah.
- Touchdown.
Hmm.
I've come to a decision
about that consulting job in San Diego.
You're gonna accept it.
Only if you don't accept this.
Oh, Patrick.
Oh!
Jackie, will you marry me?
[Footsteps Approach]
- What's goin' on?
-[jackie]Nothing.
I made your cake--
shaped like a football. Isn't it cute?
[ Scoffs ]
What's in that box?
[jackie, Knocking On Door]
josh, may I come in?
[Continues Knocking]
josh, please.
[ Whimpering ]
[Owl Hooting]
[ Whimpers ]
No, Buddy.
You can't come.
[Continues Whimpering]
- I mean it, Buddy. Stay!
- [ Whimpers ]
[ Barks ]
[Continues Barking]
[ Whimpers ]
[ Whimpers ]
[ Laughing ]
Way to go, Natalya!
§§§§[Hums "Mexican Hat Dance"]
[ Whimpers ]
It's jackie Framm.
Josh has runaway.
Is he there with you?
Josh isn't at Tom's house.
Uh, I'll try Coach Fanelli.
This is all my fault.
[Man Over Loudspeaker]
Train number 14 from Portland
is delayed20minutes...
and will be arriving on track2.
That's train number 14
from Portland arriving
20minutes late on track2.
[ Chattering ]
Know what I hate most
about train station food?
There's nothing even remotely
Italian about the Italian subs.
- Oh, hi, Coach Fanelli.
- Hey, what do you say, kid?
You mind if I grab some wood?
Sure.
How'd you find me here?
Eh, I ran away more than a few times
when I was your age.
- Usually I got about this far.
- Hmm.
- I'm leaving.
- Where you headin'?
San Francisco.
Boy, if my star quarterback's
willin' to pass up
the state championship game...
there must be somethin'
pretty serious.
- Hmm.
- Wanna talk about it?
No.
It wouldn't have anything to do
with a new man
in your mom's life, would it?
Would it?
He's not my dad,
all right?
No, I guess he isn't.
And you loved
your father very much.
[ Coughs ] So, where you headin'
after football season?
- I'm running away, remember?
- Yeah, well, I mean,
theoretically,
if you weren't running away,
what would you be doing?
- I don't know.
Probably play basketball or something.
- Hmm.
Well, I would have thought
the way you'd gotten into football,
basketball was out.
I never said it was out.
I love basketball,
it just that I love football too.
How's that possible?
You can--
You like this guy Patrick, Josh?

Doesn't mean you gotta
stop lovin' your father, you know.
Your mom hasn't.
Trainnumber nine for
San Francisco will be arriving
in five minutes on track one.
That's me.
Well, I guess this is
arrivederci, huh, Josh?
Good luck, kid.
Oh, um, I kinda overheard
you and Mrs. Salter talking.
She said that they were gonna
get a new football coach.
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, don't sweat it.
I only coach
'cause I love the kids.
If winning's all they're interested in,
I'm not the right guy anyway.
Take care of your self, kid.
Hey, Coach.
Um,
if it's not
too much trouble, um,
can I get a ride home with you?
Sure, kid. C'mon.
[ Clears Throat ]
You don't mind if we stop
for a slice of pizza?
Oh, my God, Josh.
[ Sobbing ]
Josh! Oh, I was so worried about you!
- I'm sorry.
- Promise me you'll never do that
again, Josh. Promise me.
I promise. I'm sorry.
[ Sniffling ]
I'm sorry.
Um, where's Patrick?
I gotta talk to him.
Patrick's gone, honey.
Where's he gone?
He's taken a job
in San Diego.
He's leaving
on his boat tomorrow.
[ Exhales ]
What about you guys--
It was too soon.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Where's Buddy?
I thought he was with you.
Buddy!
Buddy!
[ Gulls Cawing ]
Buddy!
He's never done this before.
He's never run away.
- Buddy can take care
of him self, honey.
- Buddy!
We gotta keep looking.
Josh, the game starts
in an hour.
[ Cheering, Shouting ]
§§ [ Playing March ]

-[Team]Ruff, ruff, ruff!.

[ Chittering ]
[ Snorts ]
Houston, we have a problem.
We have a problem!
[ Whimpers ]
I'm going down to boat
to get things ready for loading.
In the meantime, don't touch anything,
don't feed anything,
don't do anything-- nothing!
- [Chimp Chattering]
- Eh!
[Door Slams]
[Animals Fuss]
[Announcer] The Fernfield Timberwolves
and the Tacoma Giants!
It's play-offs time.
This is Fred Davis...
with my good friend, Phil Phil,
35-yearveteran of color here...
to bring you
this exciting game today.
I would say that excitement
Is at fever pitch, Phil.
This is it--
all the marbles on the table.
Oh, no. Disappointing news here, Phil.
We just got word that AirBud,
the canine wonder,
will not be playing today.
- Not be playing. Yes.
- Oh, no.
Have the checked the kennel?
[Chimp Fussing]
- [ Screeching ]
- [ Growling ]
- [ Barks ]
- [ Laughs ]
- Ready, Gus?
-[Popov]

Gus! [ Screams ]
[Popov Continues Screaming, Yelling]
No!
-[Whistle Blows]
-[Davis] Well,
the Giants will be kicking off,
so the Timberwolves will be...
- They'll be, uh, down there
on the field right with 'em.
- receiving.
Coming to Goose! He's on the five,
he's on the ten, the fifteen--
He's at the fifteen, he's at the ten,
he's back at the five.
Ohh. All right, come on, offense.
Let's do it! Come on!
Josh, open up red 45.
Come on, red 45. Let's go!
[ Cheering ]
He'll be here.
He wouldn't miss this for the world.
- Hope you're right, Tom.
- It'll be fine!
Prepare to eat dirt!
Ready! Down!
-Set! Hike!
- [ Yells ]
[Davis Over Loudspeaker, Indistinct]
- [ Groans ]
- And a fumble recovered
by the Giants!
- [ Blows Whistle ]
- And into the end zone.
The Giants score!
- Oh, this looks like
it's gonna be along day, Phil.
- Oh, we're dead. We're dead.
Let's look at the scoreboard
and see how much time elapsed,
Phil, before that touchdown.
- Where is the scoreboard?
- Huh?
- [Whinnying]
- Stop!
- Come on, piggies. Work with me!
- [ Quacking ]
Ducks are my friend!
Comeback, please!
- No! Dolly!
- [ Screeching ]
- Listen to me! Listen tome, animals!
- [ Gasps ]
[ Screams ]
Natalya, you're back !Oooh!
[ Screams ]
[ Cheering ]
[Davis] Well, it looks like
Coach Fanelli is going to try
to put some points on the board.
They're going to go
For a field goal, Phil.
Looks like Vaughn kicking, and--
- No, it hit Weeble's helmet
and it's way off to the left.
- [ Blows Whistle ]
Well, I guess that wasn't
such a good decision after all,
was it, Phil?
I'll tell you, that could
give you some kind of headache.
You know, you get hit with a--
[ Screaming ]
- Oh, God!
- Get out here, Popov!
[ Yelling in Russian ]
- [ Barking ]
- [Natalya]
I can't see anything!
- I'll find you and then l-l--
- [Chimp Taunting]
- You--
- [ Screeches ]
I'm going to get you!
[Davis]josh back to pass.
The ball is in the air--
it's intercepted!
Nowhere near a receiver.
And here they come
back the other way.
The Giants with-- No, josh has him.
Josh has him on the25.
He has him on the20.
He has him on the 15.
He has him on the 10.
He's-He's--
Ah, boy.
Well, it looks like
another score for the Giants.
Oh, have you ever seen--
[ Screams ]
En garde!
Take that!
- And that!
- Natalya! Take this! I've got a net!
Not now, Popov! Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm fighting monkey!
[Popov]
Musthurry! Musthurry!
[ Screams ]
Natalya!
[Screams]
- Come down from there!
- Natalya!
- Come get me!
- Getdown!
[ Screams ]
Why don't you get yourself down
and clean up this mess
that you have created?
- [ Groans ]
- Popov?
[Davis]Coach Fanelli
takes a heavy anchor
to the half time locker room.
Down 24 to nothing.
Disappointed, downtrodden.
[Davis Continues, Indistinct]
Hey, Coach, are you gonna tell us
another one of your stories?
- You better believe I am.
- [ All Groan ]
This is the story
of a football team.
From the beginning, this football team
had heart and ability.
But there was one big problem:
they didn't believe
that they could win.
And then this dog came along,
and this dog could do amazing things.
And suddenly,
the team started winning.
But the truth is, even without the dog,
They were winners--
each and everyone of them.
So if you believe
that a dog can play football,
then you better believe
that we're gonna win this game.
Now, right now,
let's get out there...
and give them
some of that razzle-dazzle.
[ All Chanting ]
Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff,
[ Louder]
ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff!.
[ All Shouting ]
Ruff!. Ruff!. Ruff!.
- [ Cheering ]
- You guys are the best!
Way to go, Marco!
It worked, Pudge!
[ Chuckles ]
[ Chanting ]
Timberwolves! Timberwolves!
- Timberwolves!
- [Davis]
Giants on the attack again.
Here's Martin back to pass,
he's lookin'--
Ooh, he gets hit at the last minute.
They're gonna want that ball.
Goosesteps in--
he has it! it's an interception!
- Goose! Go! Go!
- The 40, the35--
Go!Go!
Go, Goose, go!
[Whistle Blows]
Well, that looks like
a little bit of inspiration
for the Timberwolves, doesn't it?
- It just proves my theory.
- What is that, Phil?
Score more points
than the other team,
and by golly,
you're gonna win!
All right, Brian!
All right? Go. Go!
[ Blows Whistle ]
[Whistle Blows]
- [ Cheering ]
- Yes! Yeah!
- Popov!
- [ Gasps ] Mother?
The animals!
- [Natalya]
What is monkey's business?
- [ Barking ]
[Popov]
"Fish Guts. "
[ Screaming ]
- [ Chittering ]
- [ Barking ]
- Natalya--
- Get off!.
[ Groaning, Sputtering ]
To infinity-- and beyond!

It's okay. It's okay.
I'm glad to see you too.
What are you doin' down at the docks?
Don't you have a game to play?
- Huh? Come on.
- [ Whimpering ]
[ Natalya ]
Do you have a plan " B"?
We are Russian citizens!
We demand you take us
to the Russian imbecile!
It's "embassy," imbecile!
[ Screams ]
[ Cheering ]
[Davis]
Martin dropping back, Voss--
Oh, is he in the clear!
There isn't a Timberwolf
aroundfor20yards.
Touchdown! Looks bad now
for the ol' Timberwolves.
[ Buzzer Sounds ]
Oooh.
Now, come on, now. Forget about that--
ancient history.
Josh, get in here.
Come here. All right.
We're gonna get 'em
with a little "double trouble."
All right? Let's go.
But Coach, we've never done
"double trouble" without Buddy.
We're gonna have
to do it without Buddy.
Buddy's not here. Let's go.
Come on, offense.
Use Goose, all right? Let's go!
Come on, now!
Get out there!
- [Crowd Cheers Wildly]
- [Buddy Barks]
[Davis]Ladies and gentlemen,
listen to that audience!
This is a sight to behold!
It's AirBud!
Good boy! Yeah! Yeah!
Let's go get 'em, boy.
- [ Gasps ]
- Phil, AirBud is back in the game!
Yeah, well,
this dispels that rumor.
- What's that, Phil?
- What's what?
Buddy, where were you?
- Patrick?
- [Crowd Chanting]Buddy! Buddy!
Like I said-- double trouble!
[Davis]Looking for that ball--
Handoff!. Double reverse!
It's off to AirBud,
and he's off!.
He's down the field!
The Giants a reall chasing him!
It's AirBud in the clear!
It's AirBud down on the30,
down on the25--
-[Whistle Blows]
- Yeah!
[ Chanting ]
Buddy! Buddy!
[ Barking ]
-[Whistle Blows]
- [ Cheering ]
-[Whistle Blows]
-AirBud has put the timber
back in these Timberwolves.
I'm telling you, they are
on a scoring rampage now!
[ Cheering ]
First down!
-[Whistle Blows]
-[Davis]Another score!
[Phil] That is just amazing.
[Davis]It's New Year's Eve
in the end zone with AirBud!
He's got fleas. You can't tell me
he doesn't have fleas.
Yea, Buddy!
AirBud has certainly
tightened up this game
for the Timberwolves,
but they're gonna need
another touchdown in order to win.
And now, this could be it!
- Buddy!
- Ooh, no!
- 1 84-pound crushing tackle by Tyler.
- Buddy's hurt!
And AirBud is down.
- Teammates rushing onto the field.
- Stay back. Give him room!
- Air Bud-- We see movement.
- I'm all right. Get the dog!
- Excuse me. Comin' through.
- [ Buddy Moaning ]
- How is he?
- I don't know.
- [Jackie ] Is he okay?
-Just hang on.
He's not sure yet.
- Buddy, are you okay?
- [ Whimpers ]
He's gonna be all right, Josh.
Why don't you get out there
and finish the game?
But what about Buddy?
- It's okay. I'll take care of him.
-[Boy]Getup, Buddy.
Come on, Josh.
He'll be okay.
Josh, let's go.
Well, this certainly is
a crushing blow.
Poor AirBud--
out of this game.
- Oh, I just--
- Well, let's hope these guys can
go on by themselves.
Ready! Set! Hike! Hike!
- [Whistle Blows]
- [ Gasps ]
Third down coming up.
What do you think, Phil?
- Well, I think--
- Third down.
He's back for another pass.
[ Grunting ]
[ Groaning ]
If there's a miracle in the making,
it better show up now, Phil,
because this is the last chance.
- We got ten seconds left
in this game.
- [ Groaning ]
- Well, tenis-is-is enough
if you play your cards right.
- Yeah, isn't it, Phil?
- Sometimes you don't even have
to play cards, you know.
- Yeah.
Come on, Tom. Get up.
We got a game to play.
- I can't find my nose-spreader.
- Forget about your nose-spreader.
- But I can't catch without it.
- Trust me, Tom. You don't need it.
It's gonna be fine.
This is our last shot, Josh.
[ Sighs ] I know. All right, guys.
Let's do B-52, crossing pattern.
Deep.
- That's 60 yards.
You can't throw 60 yards.
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- I'm positive. You guys gotta trust me.
- We're with you, Josh.
- You just run, all right?
- [ All ] Break!
- Let's rock.
-[Bud Barking]
- Hey, guys, look!
[ Barking ]
Come on, guys.
Let's go! Come on!
What about my nose-spreader?
[ Exhales ]
[ Barking ]
All right! Ready!
B! 52!
Down! Set!
Hike! Hike!
Get off!.
-[Whistle Blows]
- Yes!
[ Barking ]
All right!
[ Whooping ] All right!
Honey, I'm so proud of you!
Congratulations, Josh!
Tom, you know what?
You got potential.
Did you hear that?
I got potential!
I got potential!
I got potential!
It's a beautiful day!

Um--
What?
Don't go.
Please don't go.
[ Barking ]
[ Cheering ]
Third and three.
What would you do here?
Huh. Lemme see.
I think I'd go long to Joey Galloway.
Blue thirty-eight!
Good call.
They're not expecting that.
- Oh, no!
- I don't believe it!
[Whistle Blows]
