Where is Tarek?
How did you arrive here?
By the flight of midday, that of the morning was full.
By the wall of Qalandia.
Business class or économy?
No, in économy, I nearly died!
You all go play outside.
And you, your duties!
Why did you not cross by El Ram?
Too crowded.
Will give you some coffee only if you imitate Brando.
- Another time?
- No
- Please.
- No
Come on
OK fine, hold on.
- You want the French version?
- No
Drink your coffee and we shall go.
- I want to come.
- Where to?
You talk too much.
You stay there.
You stay there, I say to you!
They are ready, the guys.
I am going to inform the brigade.
Inspire...
Fix it. You divert the gun and you plate it!
Go buy another packet.
Vas-y, toi.
I am not the only one here.
You rebel now?
Why you get worked up?
I have seven sisters and none of them is married.
It is my responsibility to feed them.
Don't misunderstand me, They are nice,
that God preserves them,
but none of you are handsome.
Why don't you ever tell jokes?
- I don't know how to tell.
- Just one.
Please
Promise, you all will not laugh.
I will not, I swear you.
For me and Omar.
- OK. For you.
- Not for Omar?
No, only for you.
A guy goes to buy cigarettes.
The seller gives him a packet and the guy reads...
on top:
'Smoke at night for maximum sexual performance'.
Then he says: 'Give me rather that with the cancer.'
Maximum sexual performance...
Asshole!
I touched first the stomach,
the 2nd, at the head with my elbow, and the 3rd, 
I bashed it with the face!
His teeth indented my pronunciations.
It was so deep that would have been able to you plant onions there.
That my sisters are transformed into ugly monkeys, 
if I go too far.
Do you love Nadia?
You want to kill me?
I am crazy about her. 
I don't know what to do.
Then close it.
If Tarek learns it, he will break up.
It is crazy of me also. 
But I am not going to react.
- On the head of your sisters?
- Your face!
I have letters which prove it.
What are you doing there?
You love me?
You have anybody else?
How is that?
Who do you want me to have?
You speak about Brad Pitt!
In fact, I came to give you this.
Come to see yourself after classes, 
I shall be alone.
You already miss me.
Stop! Stay where you are!
Stay where you are!
Hands on the head and then do not move!
Raise your T-shirt and turn slowly.
Hands on the head.
Come towards me.
Stop.
- Where are you going?
- To my job
Where are you coming from?
From the casino.
You are funny.
Identity card.
- Where were you?
- At my girlfriend's.
A Don Juan!
What's, this?
She scratched you?
Turn.
You see stone, over there? 
Stand on top of it.
On stone, I said.
You done with this circus?
If you are men, drop your weapons
- and fight.
- Don't move!
You see stone, over there?
Stand on top of it.
but on one leg this time.
- Yours.
- Thank you
- Good day.
- To you too.
Why this evening?
To wait, it is to extend occupation.
That's true.
What happened to your nose?
I fell off bike.
He had perhaps every reason to replace 
Diarra with Karim Benzema.
It was a serious error
to leave out Marcello.
How he became coach
by being the translator of the team?
- Idiot.
- Attention!
Pass me the salt.
Inspire profoundly,
fix your objective
and run.
You can do it on my place?
We have already discussed it.
Omar steals the car, I plan everything
- and you, you shoot
- I can take responsibility for it.
No. It is no game!
One does not become a fair resistance fighter by watching.
Quickly!
What you think of him?
"Where is Tarek?"
Where is Tarek?
Are you serious?
Soon.
Every week, it is the same catchphrase.
There, it differs.
I decided to speak to Tarek today.
We will go where on honeymoon?
Mozambique.
Why not Bangladesh?
They have enough disasters.
No need for one more.
Be serious!
You want me to be serious now?
A honeymoon or your studies?
What is your choice?
Fine, I take you...
to Paris, then?
I have never been to Paris.
And you have never gone out of this hole?
- I went to Hébron.
- It is like Paris!
Because you, already went out of this hole?
No need to, I have you, you.
You make fun of me?
Never.
I liked your last letter.
The story of the lame person is true?
Half.
Never mind, I loved. It was sad.
Before, your stories were joyful.
You changed because of me?
You have an eyelash...
You know how they catch the monkey in Africa?
The hunters throw them some sugar to make them cross.
Then they dig narrow holes and fill them with sugar.
When the monkey passes, he smells the sugar
and plant the small hand to take the sugar.
But he cannot take out his fist without dropping the sugar.
The hunters get closer
and the monkey sees them arriving.
They unfold their nets
but still the monkey does not want to drop the sugar.
What they make, of monkeys?
They grant them grants for the Sweden.
- Fool!
- That you want them to do it?
Tarek...
Yes?
- What?
- This bread is stale.
He takes out no oven as you in whizz habit.
- I think of settling down.
- Where you acquired enough money?
I save to build a home....
The police officers!
Who was with you?
Who was with you?
Who shot the soldier?
Who was with you?
Who shot the soldier?
Who shot?
Who was with you?
What?
I hear nothing.
I hear nothing!
Dry your nose.
I also.
They are soon going to free me, 
they do not have proof.
Hold out and they will be united.
Ehab El Abdallah, Hamas. 
You are with whom, who puts together?
I am Hassan Ismail, brigades of Al-Aqsa.
Where you come from?
Of what they accuse you?
I just want to tell you,
be careful.
Next days are critical. You know it surely.
They are first going to send you a mole.
A prisoner who works with them. 
So that he becomes your friend.
He will entrust you his secrets.
You will trust in him and you will say to him everything.
But he will have a microphone to record your admissions.
Pay attention. Speak to nobody of your actions.
As long as you will not speak, 
they will not be able to judge you.
But listen me good.
If you don't confess,
they will break your will,
will make you dependent and make a collaborator of you.
Then pay attention.
Never become a collaborator.
Afterwards, they come back for more.
There is not exit...
and this does not end.
I shall never confess.
Good.
Good.
I shall never confess.
It is an admission, according to our judges.
I have no clue about what you speak.
Certainly true.
Speak to your lawyer.
I can do nothing for you.
Unless...
you want to work with us.
Think about it. Take your time.
In the court-martial, where you will be judged,
this is taken for a confession.
What are the consequences?
At the very least, you will get 90 years.
They can do something?
As long as there will be occupation, no.
Tell me, Omar,
you know a girl, is it not?
You see about whom I speak?
Her name is how already?
They know and they want you to be with her.
But if you do not collaborate, 
your life will be a Hell forever.
Do not forget your girlfriend.
Don't look at me like that. I did not bring you in here.
Listen to what I'm saying.
You are trapped.
You need to choose between your life and that of your friends.
It is a difficult choice.
But if I was on your place,
I would choose my life, it is normal.
You want what?
They know that you did not kill the soldier.
If you deliver us information to catch the murderer,
We erase your past and they let you in zero to live again.
- Who killed the soldier?
- Stop, you know it definitely.
No, I do not know.
Fine.
You want to play this game?
no problem.
Tarek Abd-Al-Salam.
They will let not escape the murderer of a soldier.
They will catch him, no matter what.
I give you one month.
If they do not have what they want,
I promise you whom I would return you where you come from.
And believe me, you will not wish to go back to it.
You missed me.
You feel pain?
I too, I wrote you a lot of letters.
I do not sleep any more since your arrest. 
I write poems.
I ignored that love could be so painful.
What did you make in my absence?
Nothing.
I dreamed to learn to shoot to free yourselves.
Omar...
You were behind Operation Huwara?
do not speak of this.
- I want to know.
- Better not.
You do not trust in me?
Nadia...
it is for your own security.
- I am serious.
- Me too.
Please Nadia, believe me.
Concentrate on your studies. I plead you.
Plead me more strongly.
I ask you.
It is definitely because you plead the world most nicely.
They were hard with you in prison?
Where I can find Tarek?
I don't know, he stays more at the house. 
- Omar, I am anxious.
- Don't worry.
I control situation. 
Be strong and we will be united.
- I shall believe you.
- I promise.
I am going to regulate all this. It is promised.
Bonjour, Omar.
Tell Amjad that I will leave a number 
where he can reach me every midday.
- When did you go out of prison?
- just taken out from solitary.
- Who made you this?
- I will find out.
- You get married when?
- after you, God willing.
You have a splendid mind. 
How you doing?
- What do they want?
- that I deliver you to them.
For them, you are the shooter.
We have a bigger problem:
There is a traitor among us.
Who knew about operation?
Everybody is suspicious.
This could be it, this could be you
Amjad or me.
How is that, one of us?
A rat is enough to ruin everything.
Explain. How you contact them?
I have a number to be called when I shall know where you are.
If they rolled them?
They tighten them a trap.
But there is a traitor among us!
They will do nothing before having had it.
Tarek!
If I had confessed,
they would search me instead of Tarek.
I am indebted to you for this deed.
We won't fail you.
remain no more than 10 minutes publicly.
It is not easy to be rush about there.
Call this number from a booth 
and give them the time and the place where you will wait.
Tarek...
I want to marry Nadia
You think that it is the good moment?
I want to marry her.
They have all reasons to suspect you.
If trap succeeds,
they will know that you are one of us.
- You have really just said this?
- Omar...
If you want to liberate your country, 
there is a price to be paid.
Neither feel sorry, nor tears. 
It is the choice which you made.
Whatever it costs me, I want to marry Nadia.
Let me think about it.
Let us be first in charge of trap
and I promise to help you.
You know that?
three men consult a spiritual leader:
"If they were on the point of liberating Jerusalem,
"could they lark about with the wives of our enemies?"
He answers: "Do it and you will even be able to lark about with me." 
We are first in charge of trap.
Fine?
They would put the bed here, the table there.
The Television...
There, we could construct a shelter for the cat.
Poor guy, needed to let live and him send an opinion of expulsion it.
We call an ambulance?
What you say about it?
I dreamed to leave from here.
Have you ever thought of it?
I make of my the best.
I know, it is fair that...
I am ready to live anywhere with you.
- Even on Mars.
- it is too far.
Let us stay here.
It doesn't much matter where. 
I just want to be with you.
Your last letter was odd.
You really speak to ants?
I spoke to Tarek.
He is going to help us.
I made you this to protect you.
Thread It.
Deliver Tarek in month?
I am not an electric company!
I waste my time. It is not a game.
Why he would believe me?
Obey or I come to search you by ears.
They gave you what to eat in prison?
The stuffed chicken, the stuffed summer squash, the pizza... 
Kicks 6061... 
Why are you so pale?
They followed me.
I led them.
Really?
Be careful.
How are you doing?
Better now that I see you.
You slimmed.
I am à la mode.
How I can reach you?
You miss me so much.
not easy at the moment.
This will be simpler after trap.
What traps?
What traps?
This is not going to happen?
Amina tells everyone that you are a traitor.
Many girls believe it,
they say that it is surely true,
because they quickly set you free.
do not listen to them.
Soon, you will see.
"Soon, soon..."
I saw Amjad speaking to you.
- You are me?
- he wants what, Amjad?
It made that to pass.
My dear,
do not get worried.
What he said to you, Tarek?
Omar, trust in me. There is nothing.
He reassured me: You are not a spy.
What? You suspect me?
I need to be reassured in your absence.
To whom do you want me to go?
You suspect me?
The traitors end up falling.
I plead you.
I crossed my life wedged in the corner here... 
The sea is only in 15 km 
and I have never seen it. 
It is fair that they promised... 
to get me a visa.
A visa? What visa?
A visa for New Zealand.
Why New Zealand?
The sea, nature,
life.
You betrayed the cause for a visa?
- That brought me a cause?
- you believed what?
An association of beneficence?
New Zealand? Son of a Bitch!
Where is New Zealand?
I had a feeling that they would find him.
They can tighten trap, now.
And afterwards, me wife Nadia?
Certainly, if he accepts. 
And my family also.
There will not be any objections.
proves that you are a man.
Amjad also asked for the hand.
do not get worried, I shall speak to him After the ambush.
Omar...
Make a copy There and you return it to me.
The idea of sending your guys worked:
It gets closer to me.
Thet want what, now?
Meet tomorrow at 15 hours in the restaurant Abu-Assab.
My grandmother died at the age of 92 years.
You know that it was the error of the doctor?
They are late.
Are you sure that Hussam was the traitor?
He confessed, hushed up about the rumor.
They make you say everything under duress.
Forget. They have other worries.
- What you told him?
- what they did to the traitors.
You angry at me?
Why are you angry at me?
While I risk my skin for you!
You think you are clever?
Kind of fool!
I told you that they knew everything.
They know that you love his sister.
And you know what?
You are never going to see her again.
does have your life in air!
This son of Bitch of Tarek 
is perhaps always in a hurry, but I swear you
that they will find him at all costs.
And your baby Nadia?
They know all her secrets.
They can make a bitch out of her at any time.
I know even where you wanted to take her on your honeymoon trip,
little son of a bitch.
It is you.
Traitor.
- Traitor!
- They are going to hang you.
What happened?
two guys wanted to kiss me.
I crushed their bones.
Listen to me, Omar...
I cannot trust you any more.
You are not just a liar, 
you are also involved
in an ambush against us.
I'm sad, I can do nothing for you.
Good morning, Dear.
No, I can not.
I can not! 
I am in the West Bank of Jordan.
What do you expect me to do? 
I am not Spider-Man!
I am going to see what I can do. 
But it is necessary that you...
Good morning, mum.
It is me, listen... 
Can you go bring Maya from the day nursery?
Mum, I am at job, right in the town of West Bank of Jordan,
and you want to fulminate against my rotten woman?
Can you go get Maya, yes or no?
At 16 hours.
Thank you, mum.
Where did you learn to speak Arab?
How is that? It is my job.
I thought that you were Arab.
Really?
listen to your accent?
You speak Hebrew?
I understood two words:
"Mum" and "Spider-Man".
Listen to me... 
I want to help you, but I can do nothing.
And more nobody trusts in you.
I nearly lost my job because of you, you understand?
Give Me a last chance.
This taught me a lesson.
If I stay here, I am going to die.
She misses you?
What do you know about her?
What secrets?
secrets are supposed to remain secret.
But they will use it, if you betray us.
don't try to hide, they will be able to locate you everywhere,
even if you are underground.
to clear you out from it, it is necessary to cut your leg.
Bring back me the head of Tarek and you are a free man.
I tell you:
It is your last chance.
I am taking a personal risk.
If you fail,
you will regret having been born.
Nadia!
- I have to speak to you.
- Leave me alone.
- What's up?
- you need to tell me straight.
What?
Are you a Traitor?
You believe this?
Four of our combatants were killed.
Everybody says that you are a collaborator.
And you didn't even kill the soldier.
They all making a mistake.
- They want not us to be together.
- I ask you. Need that they speak.
You know since when I am waiting for this moment?
You imagine the Hell which I go through by being without answer?
I just want to know one thing:
That's true or not?
Say to Me that's not!
I am risking my life for you.
I am ready to wait you for all my life,
but swear on our love that it is wrong, that you are not a traitor.
Then that's true.... 
Who said to you that
I had not killed the soldier?
You change the subject? That's true or not?
What secrets they know on you?
About what you speak to me?
What's up between you and Amjad?
Give this number to Amjad and ask him 
to tell me where I can find him..
Omar, please do not come back here any more.
to listen to your messages, type 1.
You have no message.
- How did you find me?
- your sisters.
They are doing well?
You go to speak to them often... 
Very well. They doing very well. 
They ask for your news.
They make a special bargain:
A bought product, two giving.
You betrayed us! 
To steal from me Nadia!
It is just like that they knew that I liked it 
and where Tarek and me were!
- I am not the only one in...
- Say the truth.
Or I swear in front of God to kill you pronto!
- It is me who killed the soldier.
- and they want Tarek?
You said to them that it was him!
It is what they want.
That they become paranoid.
You spit out the piece, yes or not?
Speak! Speak!
Yes, it is me.
Why?
How could you do this?
How? How?
If you still lie, 
I shall kill you whatever happens.
Why did you tell them about Nadia?
Hussam had spoken to them.
Hussam had died the 2nd time, speak!
Speak!
- What did you tell on Nadia?
- she is pregnant from me.
They are dead both if she does not have an abortion.
But the police officers knew it 
and threatened me:
If I did not collaborate, they would say everything.
They would be dead both.
Dead!
Liar!
It is not her fault.
If you kill me, she will also die.
But how... 
How could she do this?
It is necessary that they go see Tarek.
- I am not going.
- need you to go.
- Understand Me, I am going there.
- you don't have a choice.
I am not going there.
Understand Me, I am not going there.
- He is going to kill me.
- He should.
He can not do it.
He is my childhood friend and Nadia is her sister...
I shall be with you,
I shall not let it happen, you are evil.
- What happened?
- an accident.
Leave Us, guys.
Let us walk.
Each time I see you, I am trapped.
How did it go for you this time?
by assuring them that you would collaborate?
You want to roll them?
You think that they are stupid?
I had to know who had betrayed us.
Who betrayed us?
You have what in the leg?
An gps device. They find me wherever I am.
Which one of you is the traitor?
They forced Amjad to reveal the trap.
I did not have answer, 
I thought that youwere you one of them.
Tarek.
Amjad made an error.
An error with Nadia.
Nadia is pregnant from him.
Which only means, she is to marry him.
- I am going to kill you!
- No!
- Tarek, please, stops!
- Drop me!
- I am going to kill you!
- Tarek !
If you kill him, it is Nadia which will pay!
I am going to kill you!
It is not her error!
Tarek...
Recover the apparatus.
The guys...
they will never forget this.
If you need, of whatever it is...
They want nothing from you.
Keep the body two months before announcing her arrest.
Why two months?
The time to clear my name.
Mister, they are coming to ask for the hand of Nadia for Amjad.
Is he ready?
Has he enough silver for a home
and the maintenance of a family?
Yes.
It is necessary that they ask Tarek.
They asked him and he accepted.
They know all the reasons for his absence.
It is necessary that I ask Nadia.
What do you think of her, my daughter?
Decision is yours.
Fine.
Very well.
In his birth, you will say that the infant is premature.
Why you cry?
Because you do not cry, you.
As from today, they do not know themselves any more.
Muhsen Ali-Taha,
new leader of the brigade of Jerusalem. 
Can we talk?
Certainly.
What do you know about Amjad Haleem?
On what subject?
What did it do in the resistance?
He agreed with Tarek Abd-AI Salam?
- What is problem exactly?
- they have questions still unanswered.
You were stopped. 
How did you get out so quickly?
I said nothing, and they did not have proof against me.
Why Amjad was not ever stopped?
What is that got to do with me?
You can perhaps help us to solve mystery.
What mystery?
The body of Tarek was frozen for more than two months,
according to our forensic surgeon.
last time they saw him alive, he was with you and Amjad.
And then?
How has Amjad money to get married?
How did it happen?
I know nothing about him.
I did not see him for 2 years.
And I have no opinion of him..
I know.
They wonder definitely what took place between you.
You were friends of childhood, no?
It is personal. 
It is not your business.
Very well, Omar.
They will find well without you.
And the culprit will be punished.
A plain round flat cake with sesame, please.
five shekels.
You want what?
- Why are you so hostile?
- what you want?
You will never change.
They want to find Muhsen Ali-Taha.
I do not think that you have the choice.
They know that he enquires on your subject.
do not forget, they can protect you from him.
Or... 
they can destroy you.
You, Amjad... 
and Nadia.
You know what is going to happen if Nadia learns the truth?
It is not serious, small. 
Get up, this is going to go.
Where is Amjad?
He should be back in any moment..
You can wait in the living room.
I do not want to be indiscreet, but How are you doing?
Very well. And you?
You continued your studies?
Yes, but I must have stopped to be in charge of children.
I am gifted in this material.
I shall resume when they will be bigger.
- How is he called?
- Tarek.
- And the younger?
- Abla.
They have what age?
Tarek was born After the decease of my brother one year exactly.
Abla is two months old.
He was not premature?
No, why? That God blesses him.
Why did you not propose me?
Why have you said yes to Amjad?
I thought that you did not want me 
because I was an idiot.
I was disappointed, recreancy earned me
and life exceeded me.... 
Omar,
I am sorry.
How could I be afraid of you 
and think that you could be a traitor?
I wonder how I could be also stupid.
They all believed in the unthinkable.
I tried to apologize,
but you refused to listen.
I sent a letter with Amjad, you did not answer... 
I understand. I imagine to what extent you were angered.
I dropped you at the time when you more needed me.
It is me who left you.
I am Sorry.
You always have my letters?
I kept yours.
- Tarek did not kill the soldier.
- It was because?
- His name in exchange for a revolver.
- Why?
A personal affair.
That would you do it, Omar?
Bring Me in one and I deliver you the murderer.
And Muhsen Ali-Taha ?
They will speak.
Swear to me you will not touch Amjad.
Leave him to me. I am in charge of him..
Fine.
Greeting, Omar.
- How are you doing?
- Well, Thank God!
You want it?
Take Them.
- This is not held just like that.
- I have never used it.
You show me how are you getting it on?
First, a revolver, it is like a woman.
If you are nice to it, it will be nice to you.
Support thereupon and withdraw the loader.
Take bullets, go downwards and re-launch.
With your left hand, you load the revolver.
Who killed the soldier?
Can I try?
- Rami...
- Yes?
You know how they catch the monkey in Africa?
