Bloody Chambak! I warned you not
to sleep infront of the staircase.
It hurts me every morning
while going to the bathroom.
It's 9.00 a.m. Late again.
You will be late for school and I for office.
Forget it, Dad. As it is
the cops are far on in time.
- Really? How do you know?
- That's what they show in movies.
My dear, this isn't a movie. It's real life.
And we cops are quite daring! We've
the guts to face any situation.
My Dad is a hero in real life too. Isn't it?
You've wet me again. What's this?
Not you. I've wet my pants.
- So what? I was carrying you.
- Hurry up! It's late for
school. - But we have a holiday.
- Why? - It's our Principal's birthday.
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
I see!
Liar!
Chambak, get up!
Answerthe call.
Get up, you bull!
It's ringing continuously for
an hour. Can't you hear it?
When does the Frontier Mail depart?
What! This is my house, not
a railway inquiry counter.
- Impudent! - Don't get wild on me.
It's you who is impudent. You've
kicked me twice since morning.
You deserve to be kicked. Got it?
Why don't you leave? It's been
7 months since you are here.
- Six months! - Okay.
Hell with it!
- Get lost!
- I will.
I'll leave after signing my film.
I've been hearing this since 6
months. How many months more?
But what's your problem?
I'm not staying here for free.
- I do look after your house.
- I know what you do.
You've burnt 3 bed sheets
and 2 pillow covers.
You've made ash-tray
out of the entire crockery.
It's your fault!
Had you been sensible enough you
would've bought the ash-trays.
- I will pay for it.
- Why should I get it?
- I don't smoke!
- But what about the guests?
Shoot!
Don't!
I agree, we were friends.
- We studied together in college.
- Wrong!
Let me finish first.
You had saved me from being ragged.
But you had charged me for it.
I demanded 500 and you
gave me only 300 quid.
- You owe me 200 more.
- What's the use?
You're ragging me since 6
months. Who will pay me forthat?
I don't need it. Because I
can't tolerate you in my house.
This is my house.
I want to be alone.
That's not possible. You're
a cop, a public servant.
They are not entitled
to have a private life.
Now I'll have it.
I'm taking the duplicate key.
When I return, you should be out
with your instruments. Got it?
Better shut the door properly
after you leave. Okay?
What do you want in the evening
meal? Will bitter-gourd do?
I don't need anything.
Shall I get it from a restaurant?
I'll get him killed in an encounter!
He loves me a lot
You'll have to do your homework
You want to be a dancer
You practice a lot. But along
with it you have to study
Why don't you have your milk?
Shall I offerthis milk to lord Ganesh?
- Why? - A miracle!
Lord will have the milk
He is here!
Look how the detergent works.
- Javed, hurry up!
- The fly has stuck.
Be careful!
Not mine, my son's fly.
They are a trouble.
Done!
- Good day, Javed.
- Dad has called you up.
Why are you people yelling?
C'mon.
You are still not ready.
- What's wrong? - Nothing.
I missed a step.
Is it? But you came rolling down.
Why don't you get them
admitted in a boarding school?
Never! They'll stay with me.
God knows, why people have so many kids!
Wrong. I've 3 kids.
One is my cousin's.
He kept her here for3 months. But
it's 3 years, he didn't turn up.
- Then send her away.
- Now he has 2 more kids.
So, I'm thinking of bringing them here too.
I think, producing kids
is your family's tradition
Had your parents been not there
you too wouldn't have existed.
How dare you kick me!
- Constable, put me down.
- Dare call me a constable!
How come there are such constables?
He always keeps on provoking you.
- Shouldn't speak as such.
- He wants to separate us from you.
- We'll not go to boarding.
- Not necessary, dear.
But you will have to go to school.
Take care of him.
- Uncle, are you a cop?
- Yes.
You people have ruined the country
- Hey, you!
Hey, fatso!
- Please buy the cassettes.
- So many? What will I do?
One for you and the rest for your girlfriend.
Who is she?
- Have you evertried singing?
- The music market is down.
Or else I would've released
my album with Daler Mehendi.
- Want to hear me?
- No!
Who is she?
Who is this handsome guy?
Your younger brother?
Like my brother. He's a bachelor.
We're looking out for a girl for him
Who will look after him...
- Should I?
I'm expert in cooking.
I'm also quite religious.
- Let go, please.
- No way.
We punjabi's have a tight grip
- She's the right choice.
- Let go.
- Here, you are.
- Amazing.
Look, he's blushing!
Let's go. She'll drive me mad.
See you next week, sir.
Get your friend along.
Nice dimples!
Who was she? I had seen
you quite often with her.
Leave that girl!
Is K.K. V's file ready?
What's there to file? Everyone
knows he's a drug dealer.
But he outwits us wheneverwe raid
him. Seems to have a big connection.
But we need proofs to arrest him.
- I want to get my hands on them.
- Whom?
Damn those proofs!
There's only one solution.
One slap and you will be fine.
Cool down.
Which consignment are you talking
about? I don't know anything.
Swine! Don't lie. Yesterday our
6 kg. samples were found missing.
You had hidden it here the whole night.
In the morning, you dispatched it.
Where is it?
Believe me.
Nothing as such took place.
Really?
Give me the kid!
- What do you want?
- I need a police vehicle.
One with a siren and a driver in uniform.
Or else this kid...
Freeze! I'll shoot you.
- You won't.
- You are wrong.
- You are my junior. Obey me.
But that doesn't mean
what you say is right.
Stop fighting!
- I won't go.
- Go!
- Don't touch me or else...
- What?
- Nothing...
Move!
He's dead!
What's this...?
Don't be adamant!
There were two of them.
No! It was one.
He died!
Don't argue!
They were two of them.
You are aging,
that's why you get confused.
There was only one man.
Where's the other guy?
He was the other.
Can't you see?
My car!
You work for K. K. B.?
Who are you?
I can't understand you.
Where are you from?
Every officer is not lenient
like me. Answer properly.
Should I try?
I know Tamil.
I was once posted in South.
- Don't you hit me.
- Speaking Hindi, eh!
Didn't I say, every officer is not of my type.
Tell us whatever you know.
If I stand witness against K.K.B.,
will you give me protection?
Why not? Trust me.
Why do you yell? What's it?
Today's a holiday.
- What so important?
- You'll get to know it there.
What are you doing here?
Get lost! Fool!
- What are you holding?
- Radish!
Get out!
Where are you taking that?
- Mr. Javed has asked for it.
- Okay. Don't come in.
We'll also have to tolerate
the kids out there.
- Something forthe kids too?
- Get lost! Nothing forthem.
You have your bath without your vest?!
Yes. Hey, you are in? Get
lost. Doesn't leave me alone.
You better stay out.
Hurry up! We're late forthe picnic.
- What happened?
- Uncle Arun.
We'll have to drive him out
or else our picnic is a flop.
- But how?
- I have an idea.
We'll teach him a good lesson.
I've got itching powder from school.
See you afterthe break!
What's it?
You forgot?
It's my birthday.
Oh no! It's 23rd, your birthday.
23rd December.
- How did I forget?
I'm indeed a fool.
- No doubt.
I remembered it...
But God knows how I forgot today.
So, you too have brains.
- Shut up!
- But I've got something.
I've got a bouquet for you.
Why didn't you tell me? Here
you are. Happy Birthday!
Give me a hug! - No, Dad
- Dad too...
- What are you doing today?
I've a holiday.
But I thought...
...of going to office to do some work.
You're always restless.
Look at me. I'm so relaxed.
Look at yourself. And you tell me to relax!
Let's go out.
- Sure. - Dad, we
won't take him along.
- I won't go. - What's your problem?
No Dad. No need of it. Please change your shirt.
What have you people done?
Arun, I'll change and come.
- Chambak, do something. - It's itching all over.
- Put on some dung! - Go and get water.
Ramaswamy here.
A drug deal in going to
take place in K.K. V's club.
K.K.B. too will be there.
That's all.
I'm a honest and respected
citizen of this society.
What scene have you people created?
J.D. if you come across a respected...
...and honest man like him, what will you do?
- Sawant, what about you? - Me!
Go on Arun, try out your hand on him.
Now it's yourturn. Let me.
Nothing will happen. It will go on smoothly.
Swine! Smoking is injurious to health.
Sir, look at this.
Besides watching the porn photos,
do you also check the drugs stock?
- Yes, sir. - What?
I keep a close watch.
2 out of every 50 suffer from AIDS.
I got it, sir.
Strange! One gets affected by AIDS
merely by watching the photos?
Give me the K.K.V. Associates file.
I'm getting bored. Let's thrash someone.
I can't sit idle!
What's it? Sit.
Mr. Javed, collect your
salary. It's the closing time.
Stop him. He owes me a lot.
- I'm first. - It's me, man.
Let's play a game. One who wins,
will collect the salary first.
You broke the glass! 200 quid
for it. No salary for you today.
Don't get wild. You may get an attack.
I'll deduct 100 quid. Here, take it.
Officer, where's your constable?
That handsome guy!
- He's in the restaurant.
- Freebie! Has to be there!
- Is he fit for me? - Yes.
What a beauty!
Constable, you here?! Where's your officer?
How can you maintain your
health by eating this junk?
My grandfather is 90 years old.
He married forthe third time.
- Ask me, why? - Why?
He was fond of eating porridge!
Along with porridge, he used to
have curd, papad, chilly and pickle.
- What's this? - Now onwards, I'll cook for you.
No need. I stay far away.
I stay nearby. We'll cook together.
You'll get a tight slap.
Rascal! I'm here with the Commissioner of India
- What nonsense is this? -
Don't you have your I.D.?
Don't laugh. Once he gets up, he'll bash you up.
He'll screw you people up if he gets wild.
He'll teach you people a
lesson. Look, now he'll get up.
He'll thrash you people here. Just see.
What happened? Get up!
Why are you getting up?
I was just joking.
A wrestler sort of a guy is charging towards me.
If not yourself, atleast think about me.
I think, he'll bash me up. Save me.
Hail my Lord!
Didn't I say, I can handle them all alone
Who told you to interfere?
What's wrong? Are you hurt?
- Look at this. - Who did this?
I did it myself.
You should be cautious while fighting.
My grandfather used to say...
if you rub some turmeric on the wound...
- Damn your grandfather! - Here's the fork.
You've eaten my brains.
But... - Shut up!
Alright!
Listen... - What's it?
Give my bag. - Hell with this bag!
Listen...
Hatred is the first step towards love. Isn't it?
I don't know. I've just resumed my duty.
What have you done? They were singing so well.
I'll break your head. This is not a music hall.
You know, I hate kids. Why did you entertain them?
My cap, yes... and this too. Don't throw it.
Take off your clothes and get lost.
Bloody! You get the kids...
- No, what's wrong? - They were from the slums.
I thought they would learn something from me.
And I'll also remain busy.
What happened to your hand? - Nothing.
- He asks me, what's wrong? - You are limping.
Thank God that I'm alive, or else
you would've been on the streets.
Begging on the streets.
In the light of all evidence...
this court declares that all
the accusations are baseless.
Hence the court approves K.K. V's bail order.
And orders him not to leave the city...
...until the case proceedings are on.
- Who was he? - Ramaswamy, my brother.
- Where's he? - In the club.
Sir, I'll talk to him. Please forgive him.
Sir, he's my brother.
Inspite of police protection...
an important witness was killed.
The press and the media are questioning us.
Mr Diwakar, being a C.B. I chief...
...it's your responsibility.
- What have you to say? - I've studied this case.
I hope, whatever I say will not be leaked out.
I think someone from our dept.
is connected with the mafia gang.
- Do you suspect anyone. - Investigations are on.
Arrest the person who is responsible forthis.
I'll submit my reports with
all the evidence, very soon.
- You spoke about some
investigation - I've a plan...
I recall your first day at the office.
And I'm happy, you work with the same zeal.
- What about your baby girl? - She has grown up.
- Did you quit smoking?
- Yes. A couple of minutes back.
K.K.V. killed my brother. I won't spare him.
I worked for him for8 years.
Even risked my life for him.
I'll provide you the information.
Put an end to K.K.V., sir.
I'll be at peace.
Here... this is my contact number.
Give me a call in case of any information.
Okay!
C'mon, start!
I'm teaching aerobics here. - I saw that.
Come out in the open if you
want your muscles toned up.
- You are here too? - Stars follow the moon...
...so I'm here following you.
What are you doing? Lay off or else...
What will you do? What?
- Tell me. - Give me the keys.
- I'll lock you up... - When wild, you look smart.
He has caught my hand. Listen...
Weigh this.
- Where's Rajendra? - Hasn't come since morning.
I've weighed each and every
packet of this consignment.
I had also labeled it. And now
I find sugar in place of drugs.
We shouldn't make haste.
We have to. Someone from
our department is involved.
I agree. But it's not a one man show.
The traitor shouldn't come
to know that we suspect him.
Or else we will not get our
hands on the entire gang.
Give me 48 hours.
Go ahead. Give me a cigarette.
- Where were you since morning?
- Here itself. I was a bit late.
I was feeling uneasy. I think, my B.P. has risen.
- Anything lost from the stocks? - What?!
I don't know.
I'm not talking about that stock.
- Don't you talk to me. - I'm not interested.
I know everything. You're
working on a secret mission.
Carry on without me. I'll
sit along with the others.
- Try to understand. - I do.
Go ahead and win a Paramveer
Chakra and show off your medals.
And I'll cheer my partner on
the Republic Day function.
Have I kept any secret from you?
I've no one else besides you.
I'll tell you only when I come to know.
Don't get upset.
Then the musician starts playing the flute.
It was such an enthralling
note that all the rats...
...came out of the house...
...and followed the musician.
- Tell us further. - The rats followed him.
He took them far away.
The way mummy has gone far away from us?
- Where's our mummy? - You nevertell us.
Please, tell us.
Come out, I'll tell you.
Do you see that star? That's your mother.
She will be with you wherever you go.
- What's it? - A drug deal in Lokhandwala.
I can't get Javed on line.
You'll have to go personally.
I'll get him along.
- Coming. - Hurry up!
- Change and come quickly. - What's the matter?
Sawant had called up. It's
an emergency. Come down.
Come, I'll tell you.
Javed, c'mon.
- What's the matter? - Sawant had called up...
There's a deal going on in
Lokhandwala. We've to raid it.
- Why didn't you call up? - Your line was engaged.
We tried our best.
We had put the receiver off the
hook while hearing the story.
So that no one disturbs you. - Strange kids.
We are serious and they just think of making fun.
- No problem. Take care. -
Hurry up! No use telling them.
You've pampered them. Let's go.
- Worn a jacket? - Yes, a leather one.
Wear a bullet proof jacket.
I'm going ahead, follow from behind.
Right time! I was short of bullets.
You...?!
You've become old. Better retire.
You knocked out only 2. Whereas
I knocked out 8 of them.
Our personal count is: Your's 12 and mine 20.
Sorry, not 12. Two of them
recovered in the hospital.
Right?
Good you came. I couldn't gather
up the courage to tell the kids.
What happened? What happened to papa?
Tell me sister. What happened?
Tell me sister, what happened to papa.
Why is papa sleeping?
Sistertell us. Please sistertell us.
Sir, I feel as if my brother
has gone away from this world.
What will happen to his children now?
Please tell me if I can do
anything. I stay close...
by here in Chikoowadi.
Don't think you are alone.
I have to look afterthem.
I have to look afterthem.
Get up uncle. Uncle get up.
Come here. Are you hungry?
I want to change my clothes.
Where are going at this time
that you want to change clothes?
What's the matter my dear? - Just see...
Your bed has got wet. - My clothes also.
Doesn't matter. I'll change for
you. Where are your clothes?
In the cupboard. - Where's your cupboard?
Where the clothes are? - Just help her.
You make the milk, I'll help her change.
Come dear.
Here's your milk.
Don't drink this milk? - Why?
Because he has made this milk.
Give I'll give you this milk.
Arun... a few days back
Javed had come to me and...
had given me this envelope.
With instructions that if
something happens to him...
I should read it and give it to you.
He used to be so fond of you.
He's willed everything to you.
After all what did he have?
His biggest wealth was his three children.
Who he has left for you.
Children sir...
The responsibility of the children is now on...
your shoulders.
According to me, leave your
house and shift into...
Javed's house and look afterthem.
If you were not born even you would not have...
been on this earth.
No. We cannot leave Javed's
children, like this, I mean...
keep them in such a place.
Then what will you do?
Sir. What will happen to the children now?
Tell me if I can be of any
help. I stay close by...
in Chikkowadi.
My daughter, you are going.
- No don't cry so much.
I am not going as if I am married.
I've just got to know him.
Marriage will take some time.
What are you talking about
marriage. I am taking the...
children along also. - You have children too.
Yes. No I mean they are
not mine. They are Javed's.
Come on hurry up.
What nonsense you are talking? - I know that...
What are you doing? - Come on move that side.
Wait, let me take my bags.
Keep this bundle in the front.
Come to meet me.
Be careful - What's this.
Hold this. - Give it here.
No! What is going on here? -
That's why I brought you here.
What are you here for? - They don't listen to me.
In Haryana they drink opium and then do this.
What is this happening?
That means even kids have started to drink.
They are not small. They all are devils.
Why are you throwing utensils?
So all of you are angry with sir. Then throw...
him out of the house.
Why are you throwing utensils?
Let all of us throw him out.
What? - What! I'll give you a slap?
What state you've made of my children.
Your children...
Streams are coming out of
your noses. Come my darlings.
Come and embrace me.
You are big. Why do you get
this hunger strike done...
forthat stone hearted fellow.
My darlings... Come my little ones come to me.
I'll pray to Goddess Vaishno forthem.
I can't bear to see tears in the eyes of children.
Lets go and talk in private.
By then keep all these utesils in there place...
or else I'll give you one.
Why are swaying about. Sit straight.
Where did you get this wild deer from?
What should I tell you?
Listen, I am like your father's sister. Your aunt.
Give me a week's time and
I'll get rid of this Arun.
But aunty...
If you say 'But' to me again. I'll go away.
Here's my return ticket. I've kept it caefully.
Alright aunty.
Done means what?
Yes... - So say this in English.
Congratualtions sir. The children have agreed.
I am from Haryana. We are
very unusual. You won't...
understand all this.
Even I haven't understood.
Come on settle my blouse. - What?
My hair is stuck in it. Come on take it out.
Why are you shivering?
You've never seen some... one young
Later on when you have a wife, what'll you do?
Keep quiet now... - Let me sleep...
Sir, how did you land here on my bed.
That also without my permission and at night.
Actually I was feeling cold.
So you came to me for
warmth. - What are you saying
Is this your culture? You are fast like a car?
Actually when I came out it
was very dark, and I fell...
Yes what is that... - Leave my throat.
My foot slipped and I fell on that skate...
That's what I am saying.
You are cheap kind of man.
If you had slipped a little
more, my characterwould...
have been tainted.
What are you saying? - Get up.
If you get up then only - I can get up.
You are right. - That's what I am saying.
Listen nothing has happened.
Nothing would have happened
to you, but I would have...
got pregnant.
If they would have asked forthe
fatherwhat would have I said?
He came to get a blanket, instead gave me a child.
What are you saying?
You could have knocked at
the door, before coming in.
Its the room of an unmarried
girl, and not the Punajab...
Mail, that anyone can come and go. Isn't is so...
Alright. I made a mistake. But what I thought...
Nothing... Its nothing.
I thought afterworking the
whole day you must be tired...
so I didn't want to knock and disturb you.
Did you really think this. - Yes.
For my sake! - Yes...
Forgive me sir. Forgive me.
I will never do this again.
Quiet... Now.
If you say, I won't say anything. My sweetheart.
Dear. Sir is really feeling cold, I think.
I've put on this blanket in
which your name is written!
Come on get up. The sun is
risen. Don't you have to...
go to the fields.
Put off the TV. Why have you switched on the...
farmer's programme early in the morning.
Is thisthe way to wake me up.
Not to wake you up, but to make sleep run away!
Come on get up. I have to wash clothes.
So what if you have to wash
clothes, why are you taking...
them off from now. Let go.
My dear... I've not caught
you yet. When you feel shy...
you look like Lord Krishna.
Alright I'll let go...
So how is it sir? - Very nice.
I am asking about tea. - That is also good.
Taste and see first.
It looks good so it must tasting good too.
Its not made ofJaggery. In Haryana we put sugar.
Come on now. I'll take out
the clothes and we'll bathe!

You should have said this.
You are becoming very

Talk softly. The children

The children won't come they

They have gone to sleep.
Yes they eaten and even digested their food.
Now they won't get up. - No. Only in the morning.
Where's Champak?
He's gone to a party to sing songs.
That means no one will disturb us.
No one will... No...
We are all alone.
O God. - Listen come here.
I have to say something. - Yes do say so.
Forthe first time...
O Goddess even for me its

What I was thinking and what you have said!
From the time I have come to

But I am quiet since a long.
- I know that, but please.
Alright then...
The food is getting cold what about that? ...That!
Make me wearthe shoe properly.
He's not your constable.
Just tie this. - Go pick up the phone.

Hail Mother Goddess!
Stop saying hello and Hi
Instead say... Hail Goddess.
Hail O Goddess! - Yes, that's correct.
Now tell me what is it? When
does the frontier mail go?
When does the frontier mail leave?
Well I have to think, because
from the last 5 years even...
I haven't gone. Just hold.
I'll find out and tell you.
Sir... - Yes what is it?
Take out the car quickly. I
have to go to the station.
Why, what's the matter?
Some poor chap has rung up
fourtimes since morning...
that when does the frontier
mail go. I'll go and find out.
Why should you find out? - Are you a spy?
Children come on now.
To complete the Javed Khan
Mission, I have appointed...
an under cover cop.
He is an officer of this department.
He will work with the drug
Mafia. He will inform us...
at every stage.
Besides me no one else knows anything about him.
New partner, if you make fun of
my vegetables I'll kill you.
You've become serious! Tell
me if you need anything.
Are you a member of the club?
I'll make you a permanent
member of the Tihar Prison.
Where is your boss? He is not here.
I'll wait for him. Get me liquor.
Get up. - Are you his wife?
No. - Should I ring up yourwife?
No sir. - Come on get out.
Anything else sir. Your boss...
What is this excuse me? What are you doing here?
Who is he?
What is this? You've changed
your attire and are working...
here too, part time.
Stand away from me. Talk with respect, I said.
Who is he? Security throw him out.
Yes go ahead and call the security...
Don't touch me!
Dog... rascal... and what else.
What is that girl doing here?
Forget that girl. I won't leave you else.
Why are you staring? Why are you staring?
You think Javed's dead, so now I'll leave you.
Have you got a warrant?
You want a warrant from me.
I don't have a warrant. I
came to give you a warning.
So what will you do? What will you do?
Take him away. Phone the Commissioner.
Throw him out!
This man has made my life impossible to live.
Where is she? Come out all of you!
Where did you let her go?
Tell me where is she?
Who did I allow to go? Who are you talking about?
I am here...
My sweetheart has come. My sweetheart has come.
How did you reach home so soon?
How did you change your clothes so soon?
Don't shout at me or else I
will raise my hand on you.
Put your hand down.
Show me your eyes. You were
wearing contact lenses.
What contract. I hadn't made
a contract to stay here.
Don't tell lies to me.
What were you doing at the club?
Sir, its not in my culture
to go to clubs. I promise...
on Kapil Dev...
You slapped me.
He hit me!
If this is before the wedding, what will it...
- be like after I marry. - Stop all this.
I'll lock you up and give you third degree.
I am not educated or else I too would have...
got a few degrees.
What's the matterwith you?
She was with us since morning.
She had food with us, and played a game too.
I also saw a programme on TV.
Ask me what was the number four song...
Yes it was...
Stop this nonsense!
I saw her at the club with my own eyes.
Am I blind?
- Am I mad? - Yes. - Quiet.
What's the matterwith you? Have you gone mad?
She must be someone else.
All pretty girl looks alike.
Quiet. I'll give you one. - Alright I am wrong.
Don't talk this nonsense
about the story of twin...
brothers like Ram and Shyam
and sisters Seeta and Geeta.
That cheat must be Seeta. And she...
What is your name? - I won't tell you.
Come on tell me. - No you will beat me.
No I will not beat you. - I won't tell you.
Come to the jail. When they
beat you you'll speak the truth.
You can take me. Even my uncle a worker in the...
Haryana Court. He used to give
the call to all criminals.
She will not go anywhere. - Now no one will speak.
I have told you that I saw
her at the club. I am sure.
Even we saw you going with
papa, and I too suspect...
that you've killed papa.
So does that make you into a murderer.
Come on speak up.
Arun you are uneccassarily suspecting her.
Why will the children lie?
We promise she was with us
She jabbers along, which...
we do not understand, but we still like it.
Don't ever scold her Uncle.
I haven't killed Javed.
You don't worry. I'll handle everything.
What did you ask for Spinach!
You asked for cauliflower and potatoes.
Did you ask for anything? Nothing.
Listen Tony. I didn't get
raddish. Have onions instead.
Listen... Come here.
What are you doing here?
Are you dumb...
Come on search him. Search him.
Don't touch me. This is my area! Understood.
I have seen him somewhere.
This rascal's photo was in the newspaper.
He had handcuffs on, and
was looking like a tame cat.
Don't you know how to read? Look that side...
What is written overthere?
Cigarette smoking is prohibited.
Come on take out the cigarette.
You rascal you smoke here.
The next time you come here
I'll take out your intestines!
Understood!
Get out from here now.
Have you gone mad Arun?
Behaving in this cheap manner, aren't you ashamed.
He had come to give back your gun.
Thank God that he didn't
write a report against you.
What kind of report?
For having entered his premises illegally.
Last night, you had gone to the Flamingo Club?
With whose permission. Why did you go there?
lts my fault sir. Arun had
tried to beep me, last night.
I was at a party and I didn't receive his beeper.
I am giving you a warning.
From now on you will stay...
away from the Flamingo Club.
Your vegetable... sir.
You told lies for my sake. Thank you.
I am your partner. I can
give my life for you friend.
Your vegetable joke was very nice.
- How are you guys? - Cool.
Not coming to the Gym these days?
What do you say Javed? He's
a good partner isn't h?
All the files made by Javed show them to me.
Sir, there's a phone for you.
Listen onions are costing 30 Rs a Kilo.
Listen Geeta I am in the
office. Talk what is essential.
Well I have to tell you that
I have sold your police...
uniform, and bought utensils in exchange of that.
- Sold my police uniform. -
What sold the police uniform.
Should I cut money from your salary?
Don't cut it yet. Cut it afterwards.
If I don't cut now how will
I make brinjal vegetables?
I am not talking to you. Talk what is essential.
I am talking about essential things.
You keep quiet for sometime!
I am not talking to you.
You keep on speaking.
Get 5 kilos of onions when you are coming home.
Alright I will bring 5 kilos of onions.
Bye won't do. Say 'Salutations to the Goddess'.
Salutations to the Goddess! Yes this is nice.
I have told you I will bring
onions so I will bring them.
- Sir I am Muthu speaking. - Yes, what is it?
Tonight sir at the Flamingo
Club. There is a big party.
Lot of people will come. Lot
of stuff will be exchanged.
Alright... sir I'll disconnect.
All of you put up your hands.
You too Geeta. Listen I am talking to you.
Me. - Yes. Hands up.
We've checked everything We've found nothing.
Search properly.
They found nothing. The Police
dogs understand, but the...
Police itself doesn't understand.
You got a warrant. Did you find anything.
Come on shoot... Come on shoot.
With your permission can I ask them to stand up.
They come and trouble us at all our parties.
Darling, why don't you feed them with something.
You want me to relax.
What are you doing? Get out from here.
Stop saying Hello and Hi.
Just say Hail, Mother Goddess.
First tell me who is speaking and from where.
What's it? Nothing that Geeta...
I don't know what is this conspiracy going on.
Let it be now. - I want to
go home. -Just one drink.
No I want to go home. - No drink for me.
How many times I've rung up.
She keeps saying Hello and Hi'
So our leaderthe Bihari Babu said...
What did he say?
'We'll talk and scream.
Break chairs and hit them...
on the heads, and that's all!
Listen...
'Coming to the 'Parliament. What will I do, by...
coming to the Parliament'
What is nonsense going on?
Pick up your band and music
and take it away from here.
What are you doing? I earn my livelihood with it.
Then why not sing in the train. You'll earn money.
This music won't do here.
Sirthis song will break all records.
You don't interfere. I have
told you so many times...
how to talk on the phone.
Don't you know anything else besides singing.
There is so much noise all twenty four hours.
But this won't do now. This is a home
I haven't opened an orphanage
or a Rest house for you all.
Understood!
I had told you if anyone acts cheeky I'll throw...
Sirwhat are you doing?
What will you do? Hit the child. File an FIR.
Or file a charge sheet. Give him 3rd. degree...
treatment and send him to
prison, orto the gallows.
Its correct. What else can
you do. You can't love anyone.
You don't know how to make friends with children.
Well what do you want?
Just because you have problems
so we also should get worried.
You can't see anyone happy.
What is your problem, friend?
Sir you are angry at someone
else but you are getting...
angry on them. You are
worried, and we understand...
that. But they are children.
You are everything forthem.
You have to make them laugh
and give them love also.
On top of that you called them orphans.
What you did with the children was it correct?
'I am sorry, my darlings it happens sometimes'
'Let it be now'
Come on all of you get ready soon. Its getting...
late for school and late for my office too.
Champak come here. Send this
electricity bill today itself.
Why don't you do this at night
itself. You waste time...
by doing it in the morning.
Because of you I had got...
late for office yesterday.
Some more bills here. The
grocer's bill, bill for...
children's items, this is
the harmonium repairing bill.
Any thing more. - That's all fortoday.
You've given me so many bills and you're saying...
their are hardly any.
Here take this list too. - Whose list is this?
List of all the people who
have to be paid. Nothing much.
Its nothing much. List has 10 pages and you are...
saying its hardly anything.
What is this? 2000 Rs, for
milk. Do they drink milk...
or have their bath in milk.
Their are four growing children,
naturally they'll drink milk.
From next month get
me 5 litres of milk.
The doctor said I have to take care of my health.
Can't you see he's getting
so weak. You too should...
have cream every morning.
All of you eat to your heart's content and I...
keep on paying the bills.
Look at the grocer's bill...
it is for6000 Rs. How much
you all from Haryana eat.
Its all Gods grace.
I have to go to a picnic at Ajanta and Ellora.
- What about that? - No going to any picnic.
What happened to you?
Come on Policeman take out 3000 Rs.
You need 3000 Rs to go to Ajanta and Ellora.
No need to go there. Nothing special there.
All broken buildings and its
very rocky with boulders.
You see its photograph in some History book.
Sir don't be miserly as far as their education...
is concerned. Its a question
of History. I myself failed...
fourtimes in the third.
- Ask me why? - Why?
My parents didn't send me
to the picnic, that's why?
I won't let my History be repeated by them.
So what can I do? Where should i get the money?
Should I leave my police job and start to steal.
Or should I rob a bank.
Don't get worried. If you
say, I'll find a small job.
I can roll pancakes and make
pickles forthe whole...
Iocality. But you must help me out on the terrace!
Why? - To dry the pancakes.
Don't worry. I'll manage everything.
Come on get up on top.
God please protect Arunji.
Yes, or else who will settle our bills!
This money forthe house loan, cut it next month.
What will I do with only this much.
Atleast give me my full salary.
Whatever orders I am given
from the higher ups, I do that.
I'll see you...
What are you doing? Why are
you shouting at the cashier.
What to do Arun. Every month there is tension.
I don't know how will I manage.
Arun please give me a little help.
Vishnu, these days my hand is also tight.
I don't need money.
You get me killed in an encounterwith those...
scoundrels. Atleast after
my death, my family will...
get o one lakh rupees.
Don't... What rubbish are you talking.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
What do you know my friend?
I know everything.
Commissioner has called you.
On Humanitarian grounds
you've got an extension of...
three months, but afterthat you will have to...
vacate the house. - I have to vacate the house.
lfJaved's children were
big, we could have given...
one of them a job, but this is not so.
One day they will grow up.
By the way, the government has
sanctioned a compensation...
of one lakh forJaved's children.
- Sir give that atleast.
It will take time forthat.
Here take this. - What's this.
Notice of the house. - Notice!
Be careful. Put this stuff in the tempo.
Come on hold it. Be careful.
What are you doing here.
The new house is very nice.
I'll hold yourteddy bear. Come on...
Come on Chotti what are you doing here.
Everyone is waiting. But mummy is there.
She is also coming with us.
Keep the harmonium properly
or else it will get spoilt.
Listen what are you doing? Sorry...
Come on all the kids. Come on all of you come in.
Children... This is your new home.
If this is new then what
must be the old one be like.
Just two steps behind is our kitchen.
Chicken in the Kitchen is already present.
This is the most interesting area.
This is... Well it could be anything.
Right now its nothing but it
can be made into everything.
Listen, he's talking a little too big isn't?
You haven't seen anything yet. Come this side...
We've installed everything close together.
This is a our common bathroom.
Sir somebody is already there.
- No. It must be the plumber.
Do you know afterwe went
the landlord kept hens...
in this house.
The hen has laid an egg in my bathroom.
Without asking you. - Exactly. You know my temper,
He knows I can come with a rifle anyday
Listen he must have felt
that since we don't pay...
rent, atleast the hens will lay eggs here.
What are you saying, that I don't pay rent.
Sir no need to worry. I know 110 recipes of eggs.
Scrambled eggs egg omelette egg soup.
Egg soup!
What's happened to you?
I sat on 2 eggs which has flattened out!
We don't want to live in
this poultry farm. Lets go.
Listen where are you all going?
You haven't seen the best room of this house.
Its upstairs, its a duplex.
Its very neat and clean.
Come on show it to them. - Yes its very nice.
Come on lets go.
Since they are insisting lets have a look.
They've come so we'll put a lift too.
Its so clean and nice.
Its so bad and what a bad smell is coming here.
Champak you saw this.
Don't worry. Tomorrow we will
shampoo these hens and...
put perfume on them.
Under both theirwings we
will spray them and then...
they won't smell. Alright.
We don't want to live amidst these hens.
Wait, but where will you go.
Listen give me two minutes.
I'll make everything alright.
Listen Champak play your music!
It really doesn't matter.
One must have place in the
heart. The home doesn't matter.
Why are you giving me false hopes?
Javedbhai must have had
many dreams forthese kids.
And I'm doing such a lousy job of raising them.
You're doing all you can.
If a girl sees your love,
she'll flip for you outright.
Today a couple of hens blushed at seeing you.
I swear by the pigeon!
Now give us a smile.
How can I smile?
As long as I was alone, this house was fine.
But not with the kids.
Yes, it would be betterwith 3 or 4 rooms.
A bathroom and a study.
Is this a house? It's a hatch.
It should at least be clean.
How nice if it were next to the beach.
A small little house underthe deep blue sky.
And...?
And flowers with butterflies.
With a small stream behind.
What else would one want?
Anything else?
In the evening, you'd sit there
in a shirt reading Mayapuri.
- And what about you? - Me...
I'd be frying dumplings in the kitchen.
And then...?
I...
Sir, first take a look at its' lovely porch.
Then look at the walls.
This house will take your breath away.
This is the swimming pool.
The mansion is attractively reflected in it.
- Really? - Take a good look.
We are taking a look.
You won't have any tension here.
No tension of electricity nor society problems.
Twenty four hours water on top of it.
Water drips from the terrace all the time!
- No... - From the tap not the roof.
We've heard enough. Now shall we take a look?
Sure, satisfy yourself. I'll be waiting outside.
The kids will be so excited to see this place.
Yes, they'll jump for joy.
But where will I get so much money?
On one hand are the needs of the
kids and my problems on the other.
And you have me on the other side.
You start off anytime, and anywhere at all.
Look a the place and the time.
There's enough place. Yet you are far away.
Sir, stop worry about money.
So what if you're not wealthy?
What do we lack in life?
You have my precious love.
I am with you.
- Saul here. - Yes?
- Terrible news. - What?
Godbole committed suicide.
- When? - Last night.
- We're going to his house. - I'll join you.
What's wrong?
Come on.
Good God!
My son!
Had I known... what could I have done?
I did not force myself.
Now everyone will force me...!
One day bribery will swallow everyone.
All honest people will die like this one day.
Not any more.
I've spoken to some officers.
And they were saying...
Why did you come in without knocking?
Forthe guest.
Somebody is knocking. Check it.
I'm telling you, bend down!
- Down! Hands up!
- The @#$%!
Go there!
Don't' move!
Hold this! Come on. Move!
Stand up.
Scoundrel! Stand!
Tie his hands.
Where's the money? Speak up!
Where's the money of the deal?
Speak or I'll split your skull!
Take it out and fill the
bag. Don't anyone dare move!
Hurry up!
What are you muttering?
My money...
Here...
The rascal speaks too much!
This is our new home.
This is our drawing room and that
our kitchen without chickens.
And that's the terrace garden.
Come this way. I'll show you more.
Brand new and squeaky clean.
- Lovely. - Does everyone like it?
This is the children's bedroom.
And this is the master bedroom.
Our bedroom.
How did you get such a big house?
Did you get a promotion ortake protection money?
What's this, man?
Kids!
From where did you get
the cash to buy this house?
Come on, tell me.
Geeta...
The kids told you that I am Santa Claus.
Santa Claus gets everything.
You won't understand because
Haryana doesn't have one.
Don't go into the water.
Don't' eat the fish!
Do you know what you're saying?
Yes sir. Javed's death the drug racket...
To reach the root of this, we'll
have to take some firm steps.
Wrongly arresting an honest committed officer...
...will lowerthe morale of the
department and break their heart.
I know Sir, but I have solid evidence.
If I am proven wrong, I'll hand in my resignation.
It's 9 o'clock and nobody woke me up.
You're going to be late for
school and me for office.
The next person who jumps on my
stomach will get a thrashing.
- In the stomach? - Quiet.
She's still sleeping. No one woke her up. Come on.
Get up. Where's Geeta?
She went out in the morning.
Where did she go so early? Wake him up.
Where did she keep it?
Where has Geeta kept my keys?
I've often told her not to
keep my jacket in the cupboard.
If the jacket isn't out,
she must keep her scarf out.
I'll wear it and not be late
for office. Where is she?
Daily I get late for office!
My motorcycle keys are in the
jacket. Now how do I leave?
What is this?
Hello, Hi. Sing praise of the Mother Goddess.
First tell me who you are
and why you are speaking.
Where are you from? Why did you call?
First tell me who you are
and why you are speaking.
Where are you from? Why did you call?
What is this?
At my house... early...
We have a search warrant for your house.
Regarding the drugs that were
stolen from the store room.
So why are you searching my house?
Search the entire house.
- Just a minute. - If innocent
you don't have to be scared.
What are you doing? Go away.
Don't touch the kids' toys.
Let them do theirwork.
- Let them continue. - Stop it.
Tell them not to touch the kids' toys.
This isn't mine.
The drugs were found in front of you.
They are the same drugs that
were stolen from the store room.
No, sir. This is not done.
It's clearly a conspiracy to frame him.
He's right, sir. A few
moments before you came in...
I was looking for my cupboard
keys underthis very mattress.
Geeta kept them somewhere...
I'm telling the truth!
Tell the inquiry committee
whatever you have to say.
Tell them Arun Uncle hasn't done any wrong.
I'll look afterthem.
Uncle will soon be back. You don't worry.
First charge...
On the morning of 17 Jan 2001 packets of heroin...
...and cocaine were located
from Arun Verma's residence.
These packets were missing from
the special store room of our HQ.
From where did you get these packets of drugs?
I know nothing about these drugs.
I'm being framed.
Second charge...
Officer Verma is working
in the police department...
...as the spy of the drug lords.
Do you have evidence of this?
Yes sir. Recently Arun Verma
bought a house in a posh colony.
From where did he get the money forthis house?
I was forced into buying this
house because ofJaved's kids.
I've taken it on rent by hocking
money and leave and license.
Commissioner sir knew about my problems.
All right.
Witness Naraindas Juneja
please be brought to court.
Have you sold a flat to Arun Verma in Santacruz?
Yes. These days the money market is very tight.
But this man is very fortunate.
Else who can shell out 1500000 forthat area?
You are misleading the department.
This is no rented house. You have bought it.
Considering your salary,
where did you get 1500000?
You have to answerthe question you're asked.
The cop working forthe drug
mafia under cover be called.
Underwhat capacity do you work forthe CID?
I'm a member of the secret
police of the department.
The late Javed Abbas, the Senior
Inspector of the special branch.
I'd informed him about KKV.
AfterJaved's death I was
posted to KKV's Flamingo Club.
To find out who was hand in glove with KKV
So what did you find?
On the night of 15Jan,
after a lot of hard work...
We'd planned to seize a big drug deal.
It would have exposed the larger conspiracy.
But right at that time a
theft was committed there.
And our mission was aborted.
Who committed the theft?
Answer us.
Officer Arun Verma.
How do you know the thief was
none otherthan Arun Verma?
The manner in which he threw money at me.
And his voice.
May I ask you how you are related to Arun?
I love him.
But what I have seen and the truth that I know...
It's my duty to inform you.
Do you wish to say anything?
No sir.
You may take the decision you want to.
Betraying the department...
And on charges of the theft of Flamingo Club...
After hearing the witnesses and
the statement of Arun Verma...
The department has decided that...
Till the inquiry is officially
completed against Arun Verma...
He is suspended from duty.
Do you understand?
Why I did this?
Take the children in.
Didn't you hear? I said, take the kids in!
Kids, come on.
You want to hearthe truth?
Yes, I kept this from you that
I work forthe dept. in KKV Club
Because I wanted to find Javedbhai's killer!
I wanted to find out who's involved
with KKV, and to what extent!
And if you hadn't stolen the money that day...
None of this would have happened!
- Why did you have to...? - Why I had to?
Why I had to...?
Don't you know why I had to?
I had to raise these kids.
I had to buy a home forthem.
I had to bring back their joys.
This was my need!
But you couldn't' see these!
You could only see my theft! Because you...
You are an honest and dedicated police officer!
Where are your handcuffs? Didn't
you get them to arrest me?
You couldn't lie to the department!
Where's your medal?
You'll get that on 26th Jan at India Gate.
Because you arrested the
world's greatest criminal!
I'm a criminal! I'll show you
how criminals treat women!
This is how he treats her!
What's my crime? What is my fault?
What is my fault?
I really fell for you in this fame of our home.
Is that it?
Look into my eyes and say I did not love you.
Answer me.
Tell me if you have any information.
I'll tell when the time comes.
When the time comes. That
means you don't trust me.
When I find out, I'll tell you.
Why should you get angry at this petty matter?
Whenever I wanted to ask you
something, you shut me up.
I can't see any solution.
What do I do?
You? Who gave you this address?
Why? Does friendship end with duty?
That's not right.
Bought the new flat forthe wife?
No man. She's time pass.
Try to understand... It's been 18 years.
- Want a smack? - No, I'll smack you.
- Is this a joke? - How do
drugs go out of the store?
- How would I know? - Answer, you scum!
Tell me who placed the drugs in my house!
I didn't keep them!
What were you talking to Javed
in the cabin before he died?
- Nothing... - Speak up!
What was Javedbhai inquiring?
I know nothing about who killed Javedbhai!
What did you say?
- I don't know... - What did you say?
Tell me or I'll kill you!
- Tell me! - Let me go.
Who killed Javedbhai?
- Speak, you lout! - I'll talk!
I was doing this forJD.
Because he was black mailing me.
If I wouldn't comply, he'd tell my wife all.
Lots of men from our
department are involved in it.
Right to the top.
The night Javedbhai was murdered...
I'd gone to tell him everything.
JD or somebody else kept the
drugs in your house, not me!
I'm willing to testify in court against him.
Leave me. Please!
- Leave me! - All right.
I'll leave you.
I'll tell you what we must do.
It's me.
I have very little time.
I have found out who placed
the drugs at our house.
I've also learnt that Javedbhai had been murdered.
I need your help.
I'm going to JD's house for
his testimony. Join me there.
Listen to me... Don't do anything...
What is it?
Arun wants JD's testimony
regarding Javed's murder.
He wants help from the department.
Even if you forbid me, I...
But keep me informed.
Man, you've come.
This was to happen one day.
How long can we hide this?
One day it was to come out.
Like Javed found out.
He interfered so we had to bump him off.
Bumped him off. But I won't go alone.
If I'm blamed for anything,
I'll spill all the beans.
What are you doing?
Who killed you?
Who...?
He killed JD before I could
get any information out of him.
Did you tell anyone that you were coming here?
- No. - Was anyone near you when
I spoke to you on the phone?
- Was anyone around you? - There was nobody.
Just me and the Commissioner.
Only the Commissioner can get all this done.
He got JD killed!
I suspected that he had a hand in this!
I'll kill him before he commits another murder!
Stop!
Running around won't achieve anything.
Think with a cool mind.
I am with you.
I've seen that.
Will you help me?
Go and protect the kids if you want to help me.
And please don't go there
alone. Take Sawant along.
Geeta here.
- Yes? - Arun has gone to
the Commissioner in a rage.
Please go home and look afterthe children.
I'll soon be there.
Are you all right?
Yes. Arun said you must look afterthe kids.
I'll call you later and tell you everything.
Yes, Geeta. I will look afterthe children.
What are you doing?
What secret was JD going to tell
me? Who kept drugs in my house?
How much did you charge for
selling your conscience?
Come to your senses!
It was earlierthat I wasn't
but now I am in control!
Tell me, who is with you?
Sir, I knocked offJD.
- But somehow Arun landed up
...and escaped unharmed.
Yes sir. What could I do? It
was pouring cats and dogs.
I tried hard but he escaped unscathed.
But the good news is that he
has handed the kids to me.
And has gone afterthe Commissioner.
He doubts the Commissioner.
Keep the kids in hand.
They are everything. Our visa, our passport.
That Arun escaped!
The harder Arun tries, the more
he gets entangled in ourweb.
Javed's death, the drug affair.
And now the attack on the Commissioner.
He will take the blame for all our accusations.
And he will be caught.
Till matters cool off, I'll push
off on my official foreign tour.
I will also take the entire drug consignment...
...to Puerto Rico without any
hassles in the government plane.
You've made a friend out of the
department by making me partner.
You go in.
I'm glad you're home.
Why did you come here?
Arun can't be controlled. He has doubts that...
...the Commissioner killed JD. Right?
How do you know?
I just received information
that JD has been killed.
Shut up! What was this girl doing in my club?
Catch the girl!
Gave the game away!
You say you're not one of them.
The entire police department
will be twiddling theirthumbs.
And we won't even find out who they are?
I've found out. The Chief is with KKV.
What are you saying?
I went to the Chief's house to ask for aid.
KKV was already there.
He tried to kill me!
The Chief had sanctioned a
government plane to go abroad.
- When? - Today. In an hour.
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
What do we say?
The Chief of CBI is my
captive. And I will be free!
If anyone stops the plane from
taking off, I will kill him!
Leave the Chief or I'll shoot!
Let him go or he'll kill me!
Don't kill me!
I'm not a criminal!
If you kill me, how will
you know who killed Javed?
Tell me! Speak!
I'll tell you. Yes.
A man from your department killed Javed.
The louse killed Javedbhai!
OurJavedbhai and he's maligning the department!
It's not right forthe kids to be exposed to this.
Those are the hands that killed Javed!
The scoundrel can't keep one little secret!
They shit it out! Shitpot!
We were 4. JD is gone. Now three are left.
With the Chief gone, two of us are left.
With KKV gone, I am left!
I am only one but the children are four!
How much is 4 minus 1?
Leave the kid.
Don't act smart!
Don't act smart! I'll shoot her brains out!
Go into the plane and bring the suitcase!
Bring the suitcase.
What are you staring at me for? Go!
Yes, I killed Javedbhai.
Well done. You've come at the right time.
I didn't have a bullet.
You...?
We would risk our lives and conduct raids.
And they would win medals!
We fight together but they win applause!
Kids, come here. Look, do you see that?
I thought enough of honesty.
Good...
And I met the Chief.
But Javedbhai was a thorn!
He's gone! Now you too will have to go!
Convey my regards to Javedbhai.
Come on!
Come! Come with the loot!
What are you waiting for?
Come on!
According to Section 302
of the Indian Penal Code...
Forthe murder of officerJaved Abbas...
I, Arun Verma and his family...
...sentence you to death.
Come on.
After losing an honest and
sincere officer like Javed...
I don't want to lose you.
Father Baptista has returned the
money you gave to the orphanage.
He said nothing good can be
started by ill begotten money.
To compensate forthe rest...
All officers of the dept. desire to
contribute a part of their pay.
