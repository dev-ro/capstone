Out.
Against the wall.
Let's go.
Fire.
-Cool chess.
-Leave them.
-Mariola...
-Yes, doctor?
Bring me today's paper.
Sure.
Sit down.
lt's clear to me you're very sick,
and can't stay in prison.
What's wrong with me?
lt's all in here.
Follow doctor's orders.
They'll let you go home.
{y:i}Everything's cool?
-lt's OK.
-{y:i}When can you start?
-Right away.
-{y:i}Check the fridge.
-Pull over.
-First we hide the loot.
-l'll piss my pants!
-You little shit...
Over there.
-What's up, Cuma?
-Officer...
-Tanking gas?
-lt's a diesel.
They just said on the radio
that a Mr. Lehman has been robbed,
so l thought:
''Cuma would've known something''.
-Lehman? The coin guy?
-Yeah.
- l have to pay.
-Open the trunk.
ls it a bad time?
ls there a good time
for diarrhoea? Come in.
Tunga! Hey, doggie.
lt's your master.
-You want her back?
-She's yours now.
l knew you'd show up.
Come on.
-How's your mom?
-Got married.
-Third time?
-And left for Canada.
-When did you get out?
-l didn't. Still have a year to go.
Got a sick leave.
You're sick?
Everyone is, Cricket.
-So what do you drink?
-You got tomato juice?
Yes.
l forgot you've got
such a view, Cricket.
-Want to know why l came?
-No.
Somebody wants
to buy a painting from me.
-Sell it.
-lt's not on my wall.
You don't need that.
How much have you got left?
lf you get burnt...
l won't,
and l'm not going back.
l'm getting a new life abroad.
Will you help me?
You show up after 3 years...
as if nothing had changed!
-And what has changed?
-You've no idea how people change.
Now l'm supposed to ask:
''How much do people change?''
-But l ask: Will you help me?
-My answer is: l can't.
Not for free.
You could afford a new life.
-l've got a new life.
-Then you understand.
Be my guest.
l work in a security company.
-Where's the other guy?
-What other guy?
Grow up, Cuma.
-Take this.
-You didn't fence them?
-They're yours.
-And your cut?
You did me a favor.
-So you owe me.
-No. Yes, but l won't help you.
Let's not ruin a reunion.
lf you don't want to help, don't.
-Can l invite you for lunch?
-Sure. There's a nice...
No, at my place. Tomorrow, 3 p.m.,
6 Smocza St., apt. 65.
Think about it. Bye, Tonga.
-'Morning, Mrs. Nowak.
-Good morning. How's mom?
ln Toronto.
... painted by Leonardo da Vinci,
brought to Poland in 1800
by prince Adam J. Czartoryski.
Tomorrow the painting
leaves for Japan.
The Lady is Cecillia Gallerani,
portrayed
for the Duke of Milan,
Ludovico Sforza.
Damn, Fatso!
-You're not happy to see me.
-l am.
What a body...
Prison's good for you.
-Shove it!
-You're mean.
-You liked Dr. Wiaderny?
-A lot.
He owes me a lot of cash.
Got a gambling problem.
When's the 2nd instalment due?
-After.
-1 million euro.
915 thousands.
l left 60 in the fridge,
and paid 25 for the car.
lt's not red.
-That's what they had.
-And my passport?
-Stefan Padlo? What a name...
-That's what they had.
-Give it.
-Afraid l'll run?
No, but you don't need it.
l keep my word.
-After the job we'll call it quits?
-Yes.
-You won't be looking for me?
-Why should l?
Give me your key to the place.
Vinci is going to Japan.
For two months.
You need time to set it all up.
-Find out when it's coming back.
-No can do.
lt's confidential.
Don't you have any snitches?
What's with all the questions?
l'm assigning you work.
And all l want is to get the work.
You find out.
Why Vinci?
-You've got money.
-Money...
l like my job.
Grzes, the GPS please.
-You have your passport?
-Of course.
l don't know if it's important...
but l think l saw Cuma.
-You think?
-Yesterday, by the museum.
-Cuma is in the joint.
-l said ''l think''.
Goodbye.
Have a good trip.
Renault Traffic.
{y:i}Police station
-That's your address?
-Right.
-You live there?
-For the time being.
-You're ill.
-lt's all there.
ls that all?
Sit!
Four against one?
-What are you up to?
-Excuse me?
-Why aren't you in prison?
-l am, but...
l'm on sick leave,
and l report when called upon.
-Up to what? l'm sick.
-Sick?
The doctor said so.
Wiaderny. He got fired.
Really?
l've got his prescriptions.
You better know that l know
you're up to something.
l'm not. l learned in prison
it's not worth it.
-lf you slip you'll be out in...
-201 1.
lt's not worth it.
-l'll see you after tomorrow.
-After tomorrow?
-l was to report once a month.
-Every other day.
With pleasure, detective.
Don't even think about Da Vinci.
-l don't get it.
-You don't?
Good day.
-Spaghetti?
Looks like spaghetti.
-Take the parmesan.
-OK.
-Remember the pasta in Murzasichle?
-Pasta? l remember the girl.
Thanks.
-Wine?
-Cheese?
OK...
lt's a Czartoryski's painting.
Too hot?
-Da Vinci?
-How did you know?
-lt's the only painting in Poland.
-To Vinci.
-Not to that.
-Why?
To a million euro?
You'll rob your country?
No more of that patriotic shit.
l need positive thinking.
But why? You won't sell it.
Which dumbass ordered it?
lt'll probably go to a coke farmer
in Bolivia,
who can't get rid of his money.
What disappears in Europe
surfaces in La Paz.
The job is impossible.
They've got a new security system:
blocked doors, cameras...
-Relax.
-No! The guy who... you know...
He's in the Police Art Department.
They were trained in Quantico!
-A lot has changed.
-So you told me.
-l didn't tell you everything.
-Go ahead.
l study law... evening courses.
So you're free during the day.
-No, l'm busy.
-Really? What do you do?
You're a cop?
Fuck...
You gave me a chance,
l took it.
Fuck me.
OK, but... a cop?!
You suffered
a personality trauma?
The adrenaline is the same,
and l won't go to jail.
So now arrest me...
or do the job with me.
-Let it go.
-You mean it as a friend or cop?
A cop friend.
Do your new buddies know
you were a thief?
-You won't do that.
-Vinci returns in May,
-but l need your answer tomorrow.
-You can have it now.
Then l'll do it without you.
You had to become a cop?
No!
You'll spend some time with me.
Check.
-The end.
-l lost.
-5 zlotys. Well done.
-May l?
-Remember me?
-No. 100 zlotys.
l used to be a junior champion.
l'll give you a castle.
Good job.
-Have you ever lost?
-Once in '68, once in tennis.
You're the famous
Tadeusz Hagen.
-Famous for...?
-Painting what's been painted.
-You owe me a 100.
-Right.
Four years ago
you did a piece for me.
l ordered a Wyspianski,
you said you could do more.
l recognized you.
-Merry Christmas.
-What?
Easter's close,
l'll hang some eggs.
l'm all ears.
A famous painting will be stolen.
How famous?
The ''Battle of Grunwald''?
A bit smaller.
''Lady With an Ermine''.
Would you want it to go
to some arms dealer in Monaco?
-There's an order?
-Yes. l know who'll do it.
lt can't be stolen. Who?
He's like a brother to me.
And he will do it.
l'm lost.
What do you need me for?
ln 1962 you copied the Vinci
for the museum.
lf l had such a copy,
maybe l could do something.
The copy is in the museum,
as hard to get as the original.
Could you make another one?
A similar story happened
in Wilno before the war.
-You're a wine expert?
-Pardon me?
This book is about wine.
Damn.
l was sure it said ''Wilno''.
What did you ask?
Could you make another copy?
No way. Old eyes and hands.
But l know someone who could.
''Wino'', not ''Wilno''.
l didn't get you tea.
-We won't enter the museum.
-No?
They'll carry it outside,
and we'll take it from them.
-ln Japan?
-On the way back, in 15 minutes.
15 minutes...
Have you heard of red alert?
lf anything happens, the city
can be blocked in 3 minutes.
You won't get anywhere
with the painting.
3 minutes is a bit short.
l need at least 30.
-Unless we do it like in Krynica.
-Say what?
We'll switch the original
and a copy.
lt'd have to be perfect.
-You know it's doable.
-So what.
-Get it done.
-Why me?
'Cause l'm being watched.
l'll give pay 90, 100 thou.
That's the plan.
You know why Nelson's sailors
were undefeated?
They were paid for victory.
They thought about buying,
not dying.
-What?
-A million euro.
Good. Great.
One day you'll become
an art conservator, Magda.
-Jesus!
-What?
-Where's the ranger?
-Who?
The ranger.
Oh, the hunter.
Frankly, professor,
this hunter... ranger...
wasn't the artist's best job.
Paradoxically, the landscape
without the ranger is richer,
-ceases to be a cheap{y:i}landschaft.
-Cheap?
lt was an 18th century painting,
property of the National Museum!
lf care so much for the hunter,
l can paint him back on.
Do you realise what you're saying?
l went too far.
What?
Let him wait,
l can't talk now.
As of today you're suspended,
until the academy's senate
relegates you from school.
ls that final?
-What should l paint?
-Hi, l'm Julian.
-l know. What is it?
-Hagen didn't tell you?
-What for?
-A Leonardo on the wall... cool.
Hang Di Caprio.
There's money in it!
A heap of dollars!
-How much time do you need?
-How much do l have?
Two months.
-OK.
-OK. Good.
-And the price?
-Shoot.
-Million plus expenses.
-What?
-An old million?
-That's what you'll pay for coffee.
Wait a minute...
200 thousand euro
for one picture?
lt's harder to paint
than the original.
How so?
Shitto.
Leonardo painted
what he got paid for.
But to paint the same thing,
with the same paints,
with the conservation work...
lt takes white lead,
8 layers of undercoat...
That's what it's worth.
l don't know...
l need to consult the investors.
l'll call you tomorrow.
Tomorrow it will be 2 million.
You haven't finished your coffee.
OK, you have a deal.
l wanted to use the bathroom,
but... l'm glad you said OK.
How much would you want
for two?
Time us.
Dead end.
-Here.
-5 minutes. Too long.
-What?
-Nothing.
Let's find a nearer exit.
-TNT?
-Thing is... l lost my contacts.
-So... we need a miner?
-That enhances the risk.
Not necessarily.
OK.
Let's try this way.
2 minutes.
-OK, Cricket.
-l've got a name.
Julian?
Sounds a bit funny.
-Where'd you get that?
-Mom sent it. From Canada.
Mom...
Look.
We'll use it.
-The worst part is the board.
-The painting is 515 years old...
We're gonna
chop historical oaks?
Luckily Da Vinci used walnut.
50 years after it's been cut
you can't tell it's age.
-How do you know?
-Dendrochronology.
But walnut-trees that size
don't grow in Poland.
Fascinating. lce-cream?
Focus! l'll need 50,000
for initial expenses.
Come on.
Where is he? And why here?
So that he can find us.
He's weird.
Weird, how?
He was a miner. A methane
explosion injured his brain.
But he's normal, right?
Sure, but he suffers from
prosopagnosia.
-ls that contagious?
-No. He doesn't recognise faces.
-There's no such sickness.
-Yes there is.
He wouldn't recognise
his own wife.
No way!
How do they cope with it?
She wears some ribbon in her hair.
l didn't ask, it's their business.
-You're joking, right?
-l swear, it happens!
-But he'll get us what we need?
-And he'll help us.
And if they show him our faces,
he won't recognise us.
Even at a polygraph.
That's the best thing about him.
-Where'd you find him?
-Prison contact.
Hi, Werbus.
-What happened on the 18.06.1972?
-l was born.
You were born...
lt's not the right answer.
What was on TV when l was born?
The European Championship Finals,
at 4 p.m.
-Who played?
-Germany, Russia.
FRG, USSR. l meant the players.
OK, you're Cuma.
l remember everything
from the delivery ward.
Anyone remembers the Germans.
And the Russians?
Khurtsilava - great name.
lt'll be our password.
And the countersign?
-Beckenbauer.
-You remember the reserve?
Dolmatov for Khurtsilava,
Koziukevich for Kolotov.
Werbus, Cricket.
-Julian.
-Julian or Cricket? l get mixed up.
-Cricket.
-Julian.
-You got it?
-Plastic?
No, plain dynamite.
-How much?
-A lot.
Follow us.
34... 35...
-36. Damn...
-Something wrong?
A lotta work. Lotta drilling.
At least we got power.
-How long will it take?
-Gotta think, look around...
-... calculate.
-So calculate.
Gimme an hour.
You can go.
Leave the helmets on...
so l'll recognise you.
Relax.
You asked for expensive stuff.
l'll cut your wage.
No, you won't.
Lehman's?
l didn't know it was you.
-Don't panic.
-l get the passport - it's yours.
-One coin?
-Worth a car.
-You want to skip town?
-Without the money?
-You'll get it after the job.
-Now. Before the heat starts.
-l'll buy you a ticket.
-l'll buy it myself.
-You don't trust me.
-You don't trust me.
Write: ''l have received
the passport, signed...''
-Are you whack?
-Sign. Just in case.
-Old habits from the secret police?
-From the Foreign Trade Center!
Passport.
l'll need a micro-pic
of the painting.
-The client asks for it.
-What micro-pic?
Now you tell me?
-The painting is easier to get!
-You can do it. Then you'll be out.
You'll get Vinci.
The photo - maybe.
So l'll pay you... maybe.
-Don't even think about it.
-Oh, l'm so scared.
Who gives and takes...
-You ever heard of Sep-Sarzynski?
-The president?
Whatever.
We need the micro
of the painting.
That is...?
They did a microscopic shot
of the painting's fragment,
-to make sure it comes back.
-The painting's not enough?
The picture is on a CD
in the museum vault.
l know a guy who worked there.
Hagen.
-The forger?
-Best one l know.
Hagen is a smartass.
He'll know something's on.
-Leave him out of it.
-He's making the copy.
-What'd you tell him?
-That it's for sale...
-And he bought it?
-Yes.
-He needs 50 thou.
-50? How much are you paying?
-100.
-l'll give you 30.
-Who are those kids?
-Who cares?
Khurtsilava! We're here!
Beckenbauer.
l could tell it was you.
-How long and how much?
-36 holes, 4, 5 hours per each...
8 hours a day,
makes it 20 days...
-How much?
-Practically a month, 500 per...
-How much?!
-92,760 zlotys.
-100,000 will be OK?
-Sure.
Your kids?
Probably, if they're playing
by my car. lt's Thursday?
Gotta take them to the dentist.
-Where's mom?
-Getting a haircut.
Good morning.
Good morning. Can l help?
Micro-pic?
Yeah.
-Sorry.
-l work here!
l'm sorry.
Only the curator knows
which fragment was photographed.
-You know him?
-Helena Antonczyk?
No, but Hagen does,
since forever.
Wait.
We're selling the copy, right?
So all we need is the micro-pic
of the copy.
Right.
Don't you get tired
from being so brainy?
l came 30 minutes ago.
-For Leonardo.
-l don't get it.
lt's touring Japan.
Why don't you believe
in the institution you put me in?
l'm a new man.
You're a loser.
lf you told us where's Lehman's
stuff, you'd get 2 years less.
l wish l knew where it was.
Then tell us.
Let's add some logic
to our discussions.
lf l knew where it was, l'd get
2 years less. But l didn't know.
lf l told you now that l know,
it'd mean
those two 2 years were unnecessary,
but also that l lied.
See you on Friday.
-{y:i}Would he risk taking the rap?
-{y:i}lt depends on the stake.
-Where's my coffee?
-And if it's the truth?
{y:i}Cuma, the truth?
{y:i}You're new, right?
-{y:i}How long are you on the job?
{y:i}-6 months out of the Academy.
{y:i}The 1 10 years old
{y:i}Slowacki Theatre, famed for
{y:i}numerous premieres,
{y:i}has just been sold.
{y:i}lnitially the investor promised
{y:i}to maintain the theatre,
-{y:i}now he plans to open a mall.
-{y:i}Alas, our plans have changed
{y:i}after the board decided
{y:i}we cannot afford to run
{y:i}a costly theatre.
{y:i}What this city needs
{y:i}is a shopping center similar
{y:i}to the London's Harrod's.
{y:i}Noblemen aren't always noble.
{y:i}Olaf Eysmont,
-{y:i}TV6, Cracow.
-What's up?
The paints have arrived, but
l don't have what to paint on.
You do.
Brilliant. And cheap.
Cheap? All my savings.
lt better be worth it.
Be good.
-Get over here.
-Helmut?
Who'd you expect?
You need a lot?
20 kilos.
Of plastic?
What are you, Al Kaida?
Not plastic, plain dynamite.
Take the cash and cut the crap.
Come on.
-Take a ride on the excavator.
-Wow!
Cut it out. You got the bread?
-50? Shall l count?
-33. That's all l have.
Are you crazy or what?
-You'll get the rest after.
-ls there anything you can do?
l play chess...
study law at an evening course...
-l write poetry.
-Evening poetry? Let's hear it.
''Not to love 'tis a burden,
to love - a wretched consolation,
when thoughts by lust cheated
overmuch only seem to sweeten
-what yet...
-... must meet deterioration''.
You knew it.
-l wanted to be romantic...
-Romantic? Why?
We might be watched,
better pretend it's a date.
l have an important job,
so please - no love, no dating.
-Not even flirting?
-Focus on the job, OK?
Besides, the only thing
l like about you is... your car.
-l borrowed it.
-Please...
And romanticism demands flowers.
Tunga, come here.
We got turned down.
-{y:i}l'm a cop, so l ask you.
-{y:i}You know very well.
-{y:i}Which one was the best?
-{y:i}The third one.
{y:i}That was a quick answer!
{y:i}... and he flooded the floor!
-Who's that?
-The cleaning ladies.
Sometimes Wilk stays till 1 a.m,
sometimes he leaves at 3.30 p.m.
What if he doesn't get
that info at the office?
There's always a risk.
-That's how you want to do it?
-How else?
Leonardo
undercoated it with the frame.
With the frame? Thanks.
And where will l get it?
A 15th century oak frame.
And at the end...
... we will join
two frames into one.
{y:i}Cuma
Excuse me.
-Your fiancee?
-No, some... jerk.
-l don't have a fiancee.
-l'm not surprised.
-Do you have one?
-A fiancee? No.
Really? So how do you spend
your free time?
l've got a boyfriend.
OK, l have to...
To paint a black background
and those stupid beads...
lt won't do without them.
-Whose lover was she?
-Ludovico Sfroza's. ll Moro.
-He did it with his left hand.
-Sforza, you pig.
Da Vinci. The whisker.
Right. Thanks for reminding.
Look... what pigs.
Leaving papers everywhere,
too lazy to find a bin.
-You had a ball!
-Oh, yes l did.
{y:i}1:1 in the 88th minute
{y:i}of the game!
Cricket...
-What?
-We've got a problem.
l'll try.
lt's OK.
-A layer of wax and that's it.
-And the footprint.
ln 1939 one of the looting Germans
stepped on the board, it cracked...
-l've got a Wehrmacht boot.
-Are you mad?!
What if it cracks differently?
l'll have it hand made.
You fell for it.
-You checked?
-l couldn't.
-You couldn't?
-They didn't leave the room!
-Check it yourself in 2 days.
-lt might be too late.
What?
-You want to tell me something?
-Like what?
-That you're not framing me.
-What?
-That you're on my side.
-l am. As always.
Thanks, Cricket.
Now l'm cool.
Sit.
What's the hurry?
l want to leave for a few days,
it's mom's name-day.
l thought you'd let me go.
-Aren't you sick?
-l won't drink.
-Where to?
-Kalwaria Zebrzydowska.
You can go.
-{y:i}You checked his mother?
-{y:i}Zofia, lives in Kalwaria.
-{y:i}Go there, check it.
-{y:i}Why'd you let him go?
{y:i}The Japanese lands tomorrow,
{y:i}l want Cuma out of town.
-{y:i}You should have locked him up!
-{y:i}Don't talk too much.
-{y:i}Khurtsilava.
-Beckenbauer.
-The game's tomorrow.
-Well l'll be damned.
-lt won't go further.
-So...?
-l'll go.
-Hold it.
You're ill, and in command.
Turn the robot off.
-Why don't you answer?
-l can't talk now.
{y:i}The game's tomorrow.
Excuse me.
He drove away!
-You're sure that'll do?
-We'll see.
Next.
There's always a risk.
Next.
lt even smells old.
Florence, 1 490.
He painted it in Milan, at the age
of 38. Which means l'm better.
Yeah.
Wait... you look like her.
-Do l?
-Yeah.
-And who are you?
-What?
A secret agent? Captain Kloss?
-lt's OK, period.
-That's what l meant.
Thanks.
-Brilliant.
-The other way around.
2 meters forward.
Cricket...
why from that direction?
l took a shortcut.
-They should buy it.
-The photo of the original.
Where'd you get it?
l got my connections.
You don't tell me everything.
-That's that Mona Lisa?
-ln a way.
-Her sister.
-l don't get what folks see in her.
You don't have to get everything.
l've got an exam
tomorrow at 10 a.m.
At 10 a.m. it'll be all over.
-Heads up!
-OK.
-What is it?
-{y:i}A bus.
Now!
-Fuck me. Did you see that?
-Yeah... in a movie.
-We won't get through here!
-Block the sewers. Red alert.
Don't ask, do it!
-lt's stuck.
-Out of the bag!
-l'll be damned!
-We forgot about the frame!
You forgot?
You did that on purpose!
l said: 37 x 49,
you said it was OK!
You should have thought!
-Forget the frame!
-You'll ruin it.
You got me fucked! Again!
Goddamn Kasparov!
l can't just sit here!
Cops are coming!
-How'd you get the copy in?
-Through St. John's. -Werbus, go!
-We're going to the other hatch!
-We won't make it!
You like adrenaline, right?
-We're screwed.
-Why?
Some asshole parked
above the hatch.
Thanks.
-They got out through here.
-Measure it, just in case.
{y:i}Marcin, where are you?
300 m away.
-{y:i}lt seems it's still here.
-Let's hope so.
-Give me the size.
-Of the painting?
-Not yours, obviously.
-37 x 49 cm.
-Frame included?
-With the frame it's 62 x 73.
-lt's too narrow for the frame.
-lt had a GPS transmitter.
l know.
Holy Mother...
What an embarrassment for Poland.
C.l.D. found this in the ambulance.
The Jap's camcorder.
lt was on all that time.
-{y:i}Lukasz, come over here.
-Coming. Don't lose it.
-They stashed it here.
-Excuse me, may l...
Careful...
The other side...
We're saved.
-They planned to come back for it.
-Looks like it. Measure the hatch.
-Well...?
-80. lt would've fit.
So why'd they leave it?
Because some jerk
parked above the hatch.
That's our car.
-Do we call the alert off?
-We prevented the crime.
lf the experts authenticate it,
right?
Of course.
Today
something strange happened
{y:i}in the Cracow old town.
{y:i}An ambulance literally
{y:i}went underground.
Some say it came across
a secret tunnel
through which robbers tried to
access the Czartoryski Museum.
{y:i}Luckily, the tunnel collapsed
thus thwarting
the criminals' scheme.
{y:i}Dorota Berny, TVN.
-What's going on?
-lt's under control.
-They say on TV nothing happened.
-They lie.
-{y:i}When will we meet?
-Soon.
-Shit!
-What is it?
-Got called to work. Pull over.
-What?! l told you to take a leave!
The commander is sick,
l fill in for him, pull over.
Wow.
-Chief Pociecha?
-He's sick, l'm filling in.
So take a look, Mr. Fill-in.
-A camcorder?
-Japanese.
-Check Cuma out.
-Right.
Paralysing gas, fuses...
detonator...
All available from the Russians.
Dynamite could come from a mine.
Sources difficult to track.
They didn't use plastic?
To contain the explosion.
Plastic is less predictable.
lt must have been difficult.
Judging by the precision... yes.
Difficult, very difficult,
super-difficult?
-Very.
-Could you do it?
Me? No. l don't think so.
Done by
untraceable professionals.
l know at least 4 guys
who could pull this off.
Give me their names.
What about Cuma?
He said he went to his mother.
He's in Kalwaria.
{y:i}Go to Kalwaria,
{y:i}they're coming for you.
Cricket?
Something came up.
-When will you be back?
-At dusk. Keep them in the dark.
l got held up at work...
lt seems to be OK.
but let's compare it with the CD.
{y:i}Negative
-God...
lt's a copy! A brilliant copy!
Sound the red alert.
Second time, so what? Do it!
l must report a robbery,
inform the board...
-Could you wait a few hours?
-Only a few.
-They wanted to gain time.
-Where's the camcorder?
-Mrs Zofia Cuminska?
-No.
Yes?
-Happy name-day.
-Thank you.
Robert's at home?
Yes.
He always drops by on my name-day.
-When did he arrive?
-Yesterday evening, he's sleeping.
{y:i}Mommy, what's going on?
Talk about the devil, right?
Come on inside!
We'll have drink!
To mommy, OK?
-Thanks, mommy.
-Thanks, mommy!
Thank you. Goodbye.
-Khurtsilava?
-Beckenbauer.
-Everything's all right?
-Yeah.
-What took you so long?
-The cadillac broke down.
-Thanks for the call.
-You're welcome.
-There was at least two of them.
-Really?
And? We didn't get too far.
Thanks.
-Let me see...
-Hold on.
They turned around...
-and came back here.
-To do what?
-That.
-Where's the bag?
That's how they did it.
Now.
-What's going on?
-Shit's going on. Get it up.
Where'd he go?!
l can't pretend any longer.
-l cannot lie anymore.
-Give me one more day.
Mrs. Sykalska, a patron of arts,
is visiting us tomorrow.
She financed the renovation
of our roof.
-Who?
-The multimillionaire.
We must call the visit off,
and inform the media.
-Show her the copy.
-lt was the purpose of her visit.
-Excuse me? What did you say?
-You said yourself it's brilliant.
The thieves will get confused.
A copy?
She's an expert on Leonardo!
-What if she notices something?
-lmpossible.
Please, our case depends on this!
Mr. Tanaka feels responsible.
For a Japanese this is a disgrace.
We're afraid he might hurt himself.
-Khurtsilava.
-Beckenbauer.
-l recognise you, Cuma.
-l'm Cuma. Get the ''Ermine''.
-You're Julian?
-Sorry.
Count it.
-lt's more than 100,000.
-You deserve a bonus.
Thanks.
l'll take the kids to France.
-lf you ever need me...
-We're out of paintings.
-Will you give me a lift?
-Come on.
{y:i}Fatso
{y:i}Out of order
Why own a Da Vinci,
if you can't show it?
The fucked up rich
like to have forbidden fruit.
ln secret chapels.
Chapels? Why?
'Cause they're fucked up.
Probably go there to masturbate.
Fatso... You had three keys.
You want to kill me? And who'll
buy that shit from you then?
You chose this place.
-Why'd you bring him?
-lt's his right. He got the micro.
So now he can get lost.
Move it.
You don't trust me?
l do,
but to be on the safe side...
-How do l know it's not a copy?
-Check.
-And it's not the copy's micro-pic?
-Are you crazy?
l also have connections,
so we'll see... what we got here.
{y:i}Positive
Authentic.
Straight from Japan.
Beautiful piece...
But why are the media so quiet?
On the news - nothing.
You're not surprised?
l did my job. The money.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow?!
Tomorrow is...
-... bullshit!
-What? You don't trust me.
l was to you like a father,
and you don't trust me.
l told you...
l'll pay after l get paid.
Easy, you'll lose your medicine.
Fatso?
Wonder-fucking-ful!
Cricket!
What?
-What'd you do to him?
-l think he died.
-Died?
-Died, he's dead.
Just like that?
Without the buyer
this wood's worth shit! Cool it!
Cool it? He's my first corpse!
And l've been to Kosovo!
Do something!
-You're robbing a corpse?
-Just his notebook.
Kreft... Kretalowicz...
Like the Forbes' list.
-All art collectors.
-lt's no use. Now what?
Leave him. lt's his place,
we'll call the police later.
Let's see whom he called recently.
Who is this? Mieczyslaw?
A woman.
-Return it to the museum.
-The corpse?
We'll sell it
to one of those rich guys.
You think you'll get to Kreft?
-You?
-Not me, someone clean!
Respected?
-l've got an idea.
-What idea?
You'll have to trust me!
He's alive.
Lucky him.
But he didn't bring the money.
Let's go.
Take the CDs!
Yes... A noble concept,
but l'm sorry to say my company
has used up
this year's budget for Poland.
lt's 9 million dollars.
lf it was up to me...
but there are others, you know...
The renovation of 3 Secession
houses will take more than a year.
l've seen those. Put them away,
l don't want to mess them up.
My heart is with you,
but my partners are in Hamburg.
lf it was up to me,
l would do it,
especially that l'm grateful
for your counsel in art matters.
Speaking of arts... l have...
-... a rare offer.
-You do?
Supposing l got you
an exquisite work of art...
l'm all ears.
lf l said more,
you'd become
... an accomplice.
You came to the wrong place.
Sounds criminal.
l have a meeting soon,
goodbye.
Relax, l'm not recording us.
Kretalowicz
predicted your reaction.
He's a loser.
You told Kreft you'd see me?
He said you won't buy it,
and l'll come back to him.
Kretalowicz wants to buy it?
He's too small.
Kreft wants to buy it?
Soon the media will talk
about nothing else.
So what is it?
After a 3-month tour of Japan
the lady and her ermine are home.
{y:i}As of today we can visit
{y:i}the famous work again.
{y:i}The first is Barbara Sykalska,
{y:i}a patron of art from the USA.
A great copy.
Where do you keep the original?
{y:i}From the Czartoryski Museum
{y:i}the most famous painting in Poland
{y:i}has been stolen...
-Turn it up.
-{y:i}... and replaced it with copy.
{y:i}The theft was discovered
{y:i}by Barbara Sykalska.
{y:i}How much would you pay?
{y:i}Order ready for pick up
Just a moment.
-Yes?
-How did you know it's a copy?
You know, l'm this... freak.
l mean... a fan of Leonardo.
l know this picture by heart
and l noticed the ermine has...
6 whiskers
instead of 7.
What an eye.
l was always very...
successive at what l do.
l bought the copy from the museum
as a souvenir.
These papers allow me
to take it abroad legally.
l know, l had to sign this permit
for... exporting the evidence.
You?
l'm oh so grateful.
Unbelievable...
One question: the price...
what drove it up?
Up? Picasso went for 104 milion,
Cellini's ''Salt Cellar''
for 60, Rafael's ''Madonna''
for 49. This one is a sale offer.
The deposit card.
They stole the bus
the day before,
-someone reported it.
-But how did they know when?
-A snitch at the airport?
-The airport wasn't informed.
l didn't go to American schools,
but for 40 years of communism
no one stole the ''Lady''.
No one even tried.
Come in!
Morning.
-What do you want?
-We had an appointment.
Get out.
l'm supposed to report...
l heard what happened.
-Maybe l could help?
-Are you deaf?
Thanks.
You won't be needing me?
Good bye.
Stupid punks!
Third time this month.
-Four million euro.
-Per head.
More than you expected, right?
-You sure?
-About what?
That.
To live abroad with a fake
passport, facing extradition?
True. lt's only a year.
Should l sell your car?
Keep it.
Vinci will get me a Ferrari.
Why do you always say Vinci,
not Da Vinci?
l'm not going to say ''da'',
like a Ruski.
Maybe you could give this
back to Lehman?
-He probably gave up hope.
-{y:i}No problemo.
But in a clever way.
Don't tell me, Julian...
that Kreft got the real Vinci.
l'd rather starve
then steal Da Vinci.
l ordered two copies.
-You switched them?
-When you paid Werbus.
l'm getting old.
-What?
-Nothing...
What?
We missed a great opportunity.
Could've sold 10 copies.
Four is not bad.
We barely made it.
-'Cause l did everything myself.
-l painted one.
-One without the whisker.
-Right. Copies can't be literal.
But who hired Fatso?
Who knows?
Sykalska? Right?
She kept nagging me
for the '62 copy,
Fatso wanted the micro-pic,
so l added two and two...
You gave him one of my copy?
-lf everything was to fit...
-One way or the other,
you're a frigging genius.
l love you, grandpa.
So...
l want to renovate those houses.
Grandpa, please...
l can do what l want
with my share.
We're not playing?
Black or white?
{y:i}lt's a truly miraculous ending.
{y:i}l'm talking to detective Wilk,
{y:i}Police Art Department.
{y:i}How did you manage to retrieve
{y:i}the treasure so quickly?
{y:i}Our whole team worked...
Our painting's on TV!
-{y:i}Will you unveil the secret?
-{y:i}The case is still...
-Those idiots say it's been found.
-What?
-Have you heard the good news?
-Yes, l'm watching you on TV.
{y:i}We are certain it is...
l gave...
l would give millions for that.
lt was your idea, and now...
no Da Vinci, no space trip.
{y:i}l dedicate the ''ranger'' scene
