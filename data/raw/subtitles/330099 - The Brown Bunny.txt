Can l touch you?
You don't want to touch me anymore?
Don't you like me anymore, Bud?
l like you.
Can l hug you?
Remember how, after dinner,
when you were done eating...

You would let me sit there for a long time
and we would kiss.
Remember, Bud?
Please, can l hug you?

Why did you smoke pot with them?
l was just going to have a little.
l just wanted to get high, Bud.
You were pregnant.
You shouldn't even have been drinking.

-l don't want to take them anymore.
Why can't you stop taking drugs?
Why do you have to drink and take drugs?
l don't understand.
You made our baby die. Our baby died.
I'm so sorry. I didn't want it to die.
I didn't want any of it to happen, Bud,
but it did.
-Tell me what happened.
-They just barged in, Bud.
-There was no Iock on the door and--
-Why didn't you teII them to Ieave?
They were standing in front of the door
and started smoking...
and I thought I'd just have a IittIe bit
and then Ieave.
-And then what happened?
-Then I passed out, Bud.
Oh, my God!
They raped me.
You saw them and you Ieft me there.

I saw them put their hands on you
and touch you.
And you had your cIothes on.
They puIIed your bra down.
They had your pants down.
Then I Ieft. I just kept waIking.
And l was walking away to go home.
