He goes to sleep in the bus. We

Must have been a lot younger
then. He is naughtier now.
True. Please go back to your
paper. l did'nt mean to disturb U
Same old stuff about clashes.
What time does this bus. . .
. . . reach the city?-Around 5:00
Usually stop at 4:00 on the way
That is when l had thought l
will feed Santhanam-ls that. . .
. . . his name? Rather formal for a
baby of his age.
Why, it is another name for the
God Karthikeyan?
Common Tamil name? -And is
that common too?-Yes
l mean to name your children
after Gods & Goddesses
Every other boy is Rahul,
Rohit these days
True. l wanted to call him
Suresh, but we are from a. . .
. . .very arthodox family. My
parents named him
What do you call him at home?
Santa- Santa
l had a friend named Murugan in
college. We what we used to. . .
. . .call him. -What?
Murgi! ( Chicken )
Murgi, No, he is just Santhanam !
lt is quarter-past three & he
seems to be asleep
Shall we have rest while we
can- Yes!
See this card, have you seen it!
Now this! What do we do now?
Well, let's take the short cut
then. The upstream road
But the road is okay, l hope?
- The fair-weather road?
Yes the same one
lt's winter. Should be okay
l guess
OK, let's go
But. . . better ask the passengers.
- Ask who? They're all snoring!
Reverse the bus
Watch out that side
Come, boss. Let's get down
and see what's up
Let us go ahead and
see.
Listen. . .Wake up
lt's time for the evening prayer
Which way is West?
lt's a total jam.
There's a long line
They're getting off from the
bus behind us too
Our bad luck!-God knows
whose face we saw today
What's up, sir?-So many cars
-There was a accident there
There is a road-block and god
know how long we'll be stuck. . .
. . . here. Too bad
What place is this? Where
have you brought us?
lt's the short cut route
lf we hadn't stopped, we'd be at
the station under an hour
But what's the problem now?
When will the bus leave?
Hard to say. lt's a long line all
the way to next level crossing
So that must be where the
accident have taken place
Someone was just telling that
200 people have been killed
Come on, go! Excuse me, can we
please go- lt is ok!
These guys are the limit, man !
Look, what they're doing in
Kashmir! Bloody terrorists
Oh, come off it, man
The doddering old fool looks
like a terrorist to you
What happened?
-l don't know
Mr. Raja. . . . hello
are you listening!
Are we there?
No! lt is not even the
usual halt
Some river bed or
something
Let me go to check
Hi guys, what's up?
Noone seems to know for sure.
First they said there'd been. . .
. . .an accident. . .a derailed train or
something
But l heard one of the drivers
say there's been a murder
The police are on their way.
Where is the conductor?-He was
here a moment ago
Get back into the bus
Someone said a tribal village
has been burnt down
Now there is a tribal uprising
it seems
What is up?-Can you hold him
for two seconds-sure
Where are you going?
l'll just be back in a minute.
Listen ! Be careful
There seems to be some kind of
trouble there. Hang on !
Why don't you go behind
that pillar?l'll stand guard
Here. . use this torch
-Thank you
Stop the jeep
What's going on here?
Why's everyone roaming around!
Get everyone back in the bus!
What are you doing here? Did'nt
you hear what l said
l am waiting for Mrs. lyer. She's
gone round the corner.
What is the problem-Problem,
there is curfew on, Goddamit
Asking me the problem-
What curfew?
A Muslim villager was killed this
morning. Just a personal feud. . .
. . . but it's flared up into a
communal riot.
Hey, get everyone out from here!
Some extremist Hindus are
looking out for Muslims &. . .
. . . butering them-You mean, the
Muslims are butchering Hindus
No. this is primarily a
Hindu locality
Some Hindu huts were burnt by
the Muslims after the murder
Now the Hindus are retaliating
lt is not safe to loiter about.
Just go to the bus.Go!
Will the curfew be lifted?
l mean, will the bus start
lt can't. lt can't even if the
curfew is lifted. okay
Some rioters-don't know which
community yet. . .
. . . ripped up the tracks.
Derailed a goods train. Until
that's cleared, nothing can move
These bloody Muslims
Why don't the mother-fuckers go
to Pakistan where they belong?
No, they will sit in
lndia and multiply
You think they'd be sparing us
if they were the majoriy.
Shut up, and just get in before l
put you behind bars.
will there be a police
patrol here?
We will be patrolling. . .
But we are not responsible for
anyone who remains outside. . .
. .the bus ! Now move
See if anyone's still out
Look what they are doing
in Amrika! Heinous crimes!
Listen, Can you manage by
yourself for the rest of way
Why? What happened?
Well! Curfew has been declared
Communal riots've broken out
Apparently some Hindu extremists
are on the look out for Muslims
They are killing them.
