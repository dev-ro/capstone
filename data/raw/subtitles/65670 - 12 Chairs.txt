Welfare House No. 2
Let the fire.
Ojczulku, need boyfriends
in your city?
You are in any fiancees?
And many a mare enough.
I have more questions.
And in this house are fiancees?
It is a state shelter,
old ladies living here - pensioners.
I understand, those that were born
the historical materialism?
When you were born, you were born.
What do you think ojczulku,
it would not be bad to drink guinea?
- Well, that attitude.
- Okay.
- Come on.
Spend with you.
A living and life itself,
a decent man out of you.
And what there was for the old regime?
My master lived here,
Hippolytus Matwiejewicz Worobianinow.
- Bourgeois?
- Sam're bourgeois.
Marshal of the nobility.
I am proletarian.
You yourself are the proletariat!
I said - the marshal.
Even policmajster salute him.
I come to him, say,
with New Year wishes,
and he gives three rubles.
Easter, let's say, just...
the next three rubles.
He promised to introduce me to the coin.
He told me - Tikhon, feel,
if you already have a medal.
Did not have time.
- And now for the give medals kept watch?
- Give.
I'm going.
Go, go, go!
My lord!
From Paris!
Hello, Tichonie.
But Paris was not what you
came to a head?
Although this is not Paris, you are cordially
welcome to our "hut".
- But I'm not from Paris!
- And great!
The Lord's not from Paris.
You came from Ko³ogrywu,
visit his deceased grandmother.
My name is Bender.
Perhaps you have heard?
No, not heard.
Well, yes, yes, yes.
Where in Paris would be known
Ostap Suleiman Bert Marie Bender-Bey?
Bert Marie Bender-Bey...
a kind of silly.
- I have not come to Paris!
- Shh, cit, cit... with Morszañska.
Heat now in Paris?
You know... I have a better go.
Where you do not have to hurry.
GPU itself will come to you.
- I do not understand you.
- Soon you will understand.
Please sit down.
Fast!
By which you crossed the border?
Polish, Finnish, Romanian?
Word of honor, I am a citizen
Soviet
I can show you passport.
Please.
With today's development
printing techniques in the West,
print Soviet passport
is so trivial, that simply laugh
talk about it.
So, yes: And - we have immigrant who
returned from Paris to his hometown,
B - The immigrant is afraid
that will take him to the GPU
- C -...
- I say again, I'm not an immigrant!
And who are you?
Why do you come here?
- I came in a case.
- In what case?
- In a personal statement!
- The personal?
And after all this you say,
that it is not an immigrant?
So what? You testified voluntarily,
or choose somewhere else?
Well!
In the end, without a helper may be hard,
Hippolytus thought Matwiejewicz,
and this looks like goodies dodger.
This can be useful.
Well.
I will tell you everything ..
The county town of N.,
where they were worked in the USC Marshall,
there were so many hairdressers
and funeral,
it might seem that the residents
arise only after it
to a shave, haircut,
Wash the head and died instantly.
No sooner she dies!
O God!
Confessed.
Pure soul.
- Courage, Hipolit Matwiejewiczu.
- Hipolit!
Please, please go.
Hipolit...
Should I entrust to you
an important secret.
Do you remember our set
Stargorodzie in the living room?
I remember, I remember very well.
Couch, a dozen chairs...
The chair seat decamped
their diamonds.
What diamonds?
It did not take them then, during the search?
Hid diamonds in his chair.
Your jewels! "
Why do not you give me them?
How could I give you diamonds,
if you missed my daughter's fortune?
Packed in a chair diamonds
worth 70 thousand!
The chair, which
do not know who is sitting!
This is, after all ..!
- "Evening bell, the evening bell..."
- Fedya... what about you?
"How many think he brings."
God!
What have you done with him?
Listen carefully.
Just a word to anyone!
Have just confessed
Worobianinowa mother in law.
She betrayed me,
Stargorodzie that, in their home,
in one of the chairs from the living room
retracted her diamonds!
These diamonds bequeathed me.
- You?
- Me!
Soon you'll live in a new
and build fabryczkê candles,
and maybe something else.
"Evening bell..."
Diamonds!
I find them.
Surely find.
I feel that the stones are chosen
with relish.
I think that now are worth 150-thousand.
- There so much?
- Certainly not less.
Only you, dear comrade
Paris, pluñcie on everything.
- How does it spit?
- Simply, saliva.
- Nothing will come of it.
- What?
Lord suite of furniture
burned down long ago... in the oven.
Peace of mind... peace.
Peace!
I am taking the matter into their own hands.
So... we conclude
little agreement.
If I find a treasure,
as technical manager, I get...
- Sixty percent.
- It's highway robbery in broad daylight!
And if you wanted to propose to me?
Well, about five percent...
the final ten.
You want me to work for free,
and yet he gave the key to the apartment,
where are the money?
In this case, please forgive me,
I have every reason to believe
that itself can manage with my case.
In that case, I am sorry,
I have no less reason to believe
I myself I can manage with your case.
Cheater!
Please listen to...
ladies of Paris,
and you know that your diamonds
almost in my pocket?
And you, I am interested only in so
I want you to secure old age.
Twenty percent.
- Yes... and my board.
- Twenty-five.
And the key to the apartment.
- Thirty percent!
- Well.
Only out of respect for yours
noble origin
I am ready to work for these miserable
forty per cent.
That's 60 thousand!
Look... you are extremely
greedy man.
