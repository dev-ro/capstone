(birdsong)
Wow, how nice...
- Oh, come on!.
- Give it to me. Here.
FERI: Well.
Listen...
What are you taking pictures of?.
Who asks?.
Ha' me.
Who is that?.
Fuck you.
GABEN: And then I think,
he's going to jump on you. Definitely.
- Sanyi! Pump!
GABEN: Do you understand what Uncle Gaben is offering you?.
On you-ug-rik... Young.
Listen, 22, but reallymax.
And beautiful, and mature.
She's a college student, a modern girl...
The lake goes, the lake goes...
GABEN
And listen, you know what's not all the same?.
Bare.
I think, shave it!
No forest, no field!
Bare hill!
I have a nose for that!
So what do you have to do?.
GABEN: Well what?. Nothing!
You talk about yourself...
Bye, bye Cingi!
- About your plans... the Tiger.
- Bye, guys.
GIVEN:
Well, these are sociological things, so...
And he will be happy with his report
or whatever the fuck, because something like this,
such a shit,
dirty place you've ever seen...
But, it is not your shame,
this is your rebellion!
Talk about this,
although I don't want to interfere...
well, give us a coffee to get us spinning...
I have Atom for one day,
but now I'm not going to split any more...
Well, if you're not laughing, Lalika,
you're not laughing.
I get bored sometimes too,
but I get over the dead end, you know?.
That's what I need that coffee for.
Fuck you, tuba!
Now to return...
they are completely
have a Mediterranean holiday home,
totally Mediterranean.
And I can see myself in the purple...
Somewhere in the far waters, up north...
I'm lying there on the purple
for this naked girl
with her naked mama, if you know what I mean,
because you understand!
My friend, our friend, to be pissed off at the same time
and his dear mother...
and lo and behold, the friendship remained.
(engine roar)
CSOKl : Izirájder, my brother!
Izirájder!
- Izirájder, dude!
- Don't look at that shitty engine!
I'm already familiar with this
to this sweet sociopath.
The little girl comes, they talk,
she leaves, and I come in to see Mama. So?.
No.
Give me a hand, Lali!
You have plenty of time!
Who is coming here?. Nobody!
CSOKl: What's up, chicano?.
SANYl: Uncle Chocolate!
- Taste... taste... taste livers!
- Nice bike, Uncle Chocolate!
Clear speech...
straight talk.
And I understand it.
Chocolate, did you plan this?.
- And why not, Lalika?.
- My God.
- Here we are! So...
LALl: What is this?.
This is a gift
I shit my pants at you, Gaben.
That would be a perversion.
It's out of character for their friendship.
LALl: Oh!
Why are you doing this?.
That's not what we talked about!
How is this...
LALl: What is it, Cingi?.
Are you, Zita happy?.
Come on, Lali! Zsuzsa!
- Listen...
LALl: Zsuzsa. Sorry!
ROKA: I'll be right back, children!
Rich, posh!
His mother has breasts so big...
You're going crazy!
And they're heading upwards like Gagarin!
Two Gagarin!
He's got a big chest, if you know what I mean...
- And there are two, huh?.
- Two, two.
Listen Gaben!
I have a dream.
Yes?. Well?.
LALl: May I say.
- Yes, can I?.
- Well, it's winter.
- Say, just a coffee first.
- But now without sugar.
- Okay.
Is it winter, is it spring?.
I don't know. Anyway, you...
ROKA: Where to?. Where?.
You are approaching the Tiger.
I'll be right back, kids!
The snow is dusting under your feet,
in the winter version, of course.
The lights are beautiful, and my father,
behold, you have no tongue.
- No?.
- You can't talk.
You're trying to make a point,
but I won't let you.
Because then I would have to be offended.
Chocolate! Fucking hell!
ClNGÁR: Are you normal?.
CSOKl: Izirájder, dude!
CSOKl: Nyugavér foals!
CSOKl: No need to worry!
- I'll raise this shit with one hand!
- Uh-huh.
- Beer anyone?.
- No, thank you very much!
Not damaged?. He's fine.
Do something about it, Sanyika.
CSOKl: Well, kids, how's my belly?.
It's not up for debate anymore, bro!
- Bittedanke!
- Are you normal?.
As many languages, as many people!
You think I don't read, huh?.
Fucking fucking fuck!
Well, you see...
that's how things turn out!
LALl (laughing): Babetta the Betrayer!
ROKA: Children...
Stop being so
indifferent!

Are you not mine?.
(honking)
BETTl : Dad, come on, hey!

JOLl : Stop it!

Nothing, nothing! But how did it get there?.
How did it get there?.

What?. This?.

- Get down! Everybody down!
REZSŐ: Come on, Uncle Ossi!
- Shut up!
- Come on!

REZSŐ: Faster!
OSZl: Get in!

OSZl: Let's get inside!
- You can't be that stupid!
- What did you do?.
- What?. I threw it away.
- But I didn't tell you!
- Well, to whom?.
Well, never mind now,
throw it away yourself!
- Boss! Boss! I'm coming in!
- It's all right! Easy, Sanyi.
Youth, foolishness!
LALl: Brother Ossi, I...
I don't...
Hallgass, Lali.
What have you got me into, huh?.
OSZl: You...
Did you have sex with my wife?.
OSZl: What to do
do with you now?. What?.
I'm going mushrooming...
with the family.
Bird shits windshield, I would wipe.
But that shit
doesn't just wipe, it blows.
My car spits on me?.
My wife tells on me?.
Well, it came out of the vent.
Yes?. What?.
What?. The letter!
- Oszi! Lali!
OSZl : Where the fuck is he, he was here...
- Crocodile!
- Come out now!
(shot)
So my convertible ratted you out!
Now I have one too,
fuck it.
- Get out of here!
- This one's bought. Oh, my God!
Mary!
It's... bought!
You cheated!
With a crocodile.
REZSŐ: Jolika, what happened?.
Nothing.
- Boss! Here I am!
- Sanyika! Take it easy! It's dangerous! Poof!
OSZl: Little cat...
braided on you...
you crazy... you lickspittle...
That's it! Not a crocodile!
Lollipop!
Mother!
Oh, Lali... Do you love her?.
I... Jolit?.
No.
You too.
Fucking hell...
But... I took it...
JOLl: I don't believe it!
OSZl: Now you're talking!
- They can't get it out!
- This woman is eating my life like rust.
It always needs something.
What he waves is only ten thousand.
What is it?.
A piece of shit. It's nothing.
And I'm going with this Trabant.
Even in winter...
OSZl: Nothing is good for that,
what we have.
Small house, small garden, small decency.
I cook for myself, Lalika.
Brother Osi!
I'm actually with Betti...
Ah, that's rust too!
She's clean.
Those two cattle.
And that lackey...
- What?.
- Supposedly there was something with that too.
LALl: What?.
LALl: Mustache?.
No, no. Really?.
- Everyone says that
he came to us... - To fucking life.
Once it was around
something drawn on the bed.
- Well, that's a policeman thing, isn't it?.
- Well, they do the dead body, Brother Ossi.
Hulla?. Well, it wasn't.
Te Lali,
you've come in handy for me.
I'll scrape off the rust, you know.
I've got something in my hand now...
Listen!
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch,
what did you do to my wife?.
CSOKl: Respect to the authorities!
- Say something, Lali! Shout!
- Come on, brother Ossi...
What should I shout now? - Come on!
What?.
Your mother's cunt... Locked?.
Kisses, Jolika!
Lali?.
Well!
- Sanyika! - Hello, boss!
- What are you doing here?.
- This is Sanyi.
- Hello, Uncle Ossi!
Hi... Come on!
REZSŐ: Good of you to come.
Osi has taken Lali hostage.
CSOKl: Lali!
- I'm in here!
CSOKl: With what?.
- With a gun.
- Shall I throw it out of his hands?.
- With what?.
Yes, nothing.
Calm down, Jolika!
I'm going... relax!
- Coming, Moustache?.
- Me?. Sure...
- I'd like to go outside, brother Osi.
- Shout or I'll shoot!
(Lali shouts)
(Rezső's gun goes off)
What is it now?.
- Sorry, it was me.
- Yeah!
- Calm down, Jolika!
- Oil is really tired, Lalika!
- Cattle! Guns are not toys!
- You okay, Rezső?.
Rock, come on out, because
we're calling for backup.
If they come out,
we both die!
You and me, or Lali and you?.
The crocodile and me.
Here I am, Lalika! Need help?.
How much of a hostage are you?.
- Are you free for a beer?.
- Get out of here, idiot!
- Graceful munchies!
- Well, all right, Brother Ossi,
- I say...
- You're not going anywhere!
No. But...
the hostage can only drink a hubi!
Well... Drink...
LALl: Excuse me...
But even the... hostage-taker is not forbidden...
Right?. I'd offer.
- Well... I set the terms...
- That's right.
What is "Latin lever"?.
LALl: I don't know, Brother Osi,
I didn't write it.
Te Joli! What is it...
"Latin lever"?.
Lover, no?.
Well, fucking machine.
- Thanks, Chocolate, you've been very helpful.
- Prego.
I have demands!
- Material?.
- No.
- I could use a beer,
Brother Osi?. Now you're close...
You want the beer now, moron?.
You'd rather go outside, wouldn't you?.
You could fucking negotiate.
Well, he could negotiate, couldn't he.
Okay.
Where's the beer, Osi?.
I want Mustache to undress
and get in the lake!
No!
If you do not meet my demands,
I will execute a hostage every half hour!
Then you'll be home by noon,
Brother Ossi...
Ouch! Stop it, Ossi!
Jolika! Listen to me!
Just between you and me...
Quite frankly
After all...
investigative...
s'al then...
What happened?.
I slept with Lali.
There. That's what happened.
But when!
With him too?.
BAJUSZ: You hear?.
Wow, I kiss your hand!
Te Lali!
- What do you do with women?.
- When?.
Well, when...
Lollipop...
- Hubit?. Brother Ossi?.
- No, not anymore, not anymore...
- My last wish.
- Okay, then, yes.
OSZl: Well?.
I'll give Chocolate a beer.
LALl: He's begging.
Well, Chocolate... Squeeze one in!
There is a sense of self in the world...
You didn't give me before, I'm not going now.
- Can you get it for me, Rezső?
- Of course.
Well, um...
orally.
Oval?.
Well... When...
Well, like when
from pancakes to...
the jam.
My brothers Ossi and I...
don't they?.
What pancake?.
Here are the pancakes...
The man says, "Oops,
I'm going to get the jam out of this.
And... and...
- One more hubit, brother Osi.
- Well, good.
CSOKl: Fox!
- Hi Uncle Fox!
- Come here! Fox, listen!
Come on!
Guess what, Lali got hit by a Trabant,
Ossi and Lali...
Hi!
- Hello.
- Listen... Fox.
- What?.
- The Lalit is the Trabi...
blown...
ROKA: Big screen?.
CSOKl: What?.
ROKA: I have one too.
Fucking great TV. For sale.
My Nóném, my East...
It was brought from the GDR a long time ago.
It was brand new then.
- Hey, don't you need one of those round things?.
- You, Lalika!
(Singing): As long as I live,
I'll fuck you,
if I die,
I'm not licking anymore!
(Osi laughs)
ROKA: Here I am.
- Are you chatting?.
- Get the hell out of here, Fox.
CSOKl : Leave it, Fox,
Lali has no friends today...
What Jolika?.
Lalika, I would bring you in the days
a carousel...
- I really need that...
- Have you thought about it?. Well, that's great.
I knew we were thinking in the same direction.
On these small farms
there are treasures.
You know what they are
they collected?.
Cunning peasants,
but, if you're a man
find the key to them...
there, there are wonders!
For example, the other day I found a tank.
It was a fully finished German tank.
The back was cut off by something
with a big fucking flame,
and then they added
a hedge trimmer.
If you want, you can also open it...
I've been running all over the place
my eyes, Jolika.
Now...
In summary.
They have the pancakes, we...
we have the ice cream, they...
Fucking hell, Lalika.
I don't believe it!
But it's true.
Yes?.
Come on Lali, let's go!
Thank God, my brother Osi!
Oh...
It's OK.
It's okay!
Thank God!
No personal injury?.
Osi is drunk.
Lalika! We talked about that!
Wow, Lali! I'll get the car!
Take me home.
I'm in this Trabant
for a week.
I'm here, Uncle Ossi.
(Sanyi between two snores)
Pancakes...
OSZl : Well, I can do that too!
REZSŐ: Sit down, Uncle Ossi!
JOLl : Watch your feet...
BAJUSZ: Feet like that... out the window.
REZSŐ: Come on, Moustache, here's your vice.
- You bastard.
- Now what, why'?.
I'm pregnant and you don't call me?.
Are you pregnant?.
No. But if I were,
would you call me?.
Well, you can't be from me
pregnant, Bettike.
- But if I were, would you call me?.
- Well, you're not!
- Piti!
JOLl: Bettike! Get in!
Others will be happy to marry you, you know.
Well, if someone else marries you.
I'll be glad too, Bettike.
BETTl: Where?.
JOLl: To your father!
(speaking strangely) Excuse me,
would you mind taking off your sunglasses for the recording?.
Of course.
Neme?.
(Chocolate laughs in the background)
Male.
I thought it showed.
You have to ask.
There was nothing suspicious about Lajos?.
(another laugh)
Good. Then the...
second question.
Wait a fucking minute!
Tell me you don't mind
this repulsive environment?.
What?.
(Chocolates laugh)
Miliő.
What kind of environment?.
No. I don't mind.
Ok, then the next question is...
Now he lives the way he lives
you imagined ten years ago?.
- You, Say that again.
- Now he lives as he imagined ten...
- Am I living the life I imagined...
- Ten years ago...
Whoa, fuck... sorry!
I'll just...
You, I never wanted anything.
So... good question.
Somehow I always was.
I thought, somehow I'll get there...
Then... Well, it did.
Let's say, five years ago.
ago I tried.
there on the bend I moved,
with the Tiger, but the wheel broke off.
Sanyi was here
ten years ago.
- Sanyi?.
- And he will still be here in ten years.
SANYl : Hello. Want a frog?.
(Chocolates laugh)
(mocking)
Sanyi...
- Him? Yes, he's the king.
King Sanyi.
- You, wouldn't you rather talk to him?.
- Uh, no, thanks. Are you brothers?.
No, friend.
- Friend...
- Yes... Other people come here.
Chocolate and Gaben among others.
- Who are they? - Never mind.
Village tramps, you know.
One is gay,
and the other is impotent...
Yes...
- You know Gaben, right?.
- Yeah.
Well, he's the gay one.
Yeah, no. Wait...
Chocolate for the impotent...
Ah, I don't know, maybe it's the other way around.
Anyway.
But, yes, I got it.
Gaben impotens.
Very impotent. Badly.
Really?.
Gaben is impotent.
Yes, but it's not an organ thing with him.
Spiritual, you know. He was a pervert...
Well, as long as he got a hard-on.
Well, he can't get it up now, poor thing.
Bitten by the guinea pig there.
Whew, gross...
- Hard. On his dick.
- Where, you animal?.
- I told you to answer normally!
- So what?. Laugh now!
- Look at this hair!
- I didn't even ask if it was bare...
- Wow, how beautiful!
- Take it after him!
Alizka! Say hello to your mother!
I'll drop by!
SOCIOLOGY:
Stupid jerks!
What have you done, you animal?.
- You left this here. No need for that, boss.
CSOKl: That's on my honor, Lali.
- That'll be two cases of beer, gringo...
LALl: Really?.
GIRL SOCOLOGIST: You stinking bastards!
LALl: Is your pussy naked?.
LALl: Listen... naked?.
GABEN: Now, don't tease him!
- It's pure black.
So, what?.
Are we that tan?.
GABEN: The hat, you idiot.
- In summer?.
LALl: All right, stop picking on him!
Give me that!
GABEN: One is dumber than the other.
CSOKl: Now! Now we've got it. Wait.
SANYl: We are there!
- You embarrassed me in front of the girl.
- The one that tried to jump me, right?.
- Don't tell me you don't have another girl.
- Well, Betti called. The other day...
I do not know, there is a
I have a feeling that...
I think she might be pregnant.
All right, calm down,
he tried it on me. She's not pregnant.
- Nebasz...
- Who is the king?.
- I am the king!
LALl: That's right, Sanyika. You are the king!
LALl: Sanyika, put me down!
SANYl: Boss! Let her go!
Lali! Sanyi, listen!
Listen! Here!
Chocks away!
What was the most beautiful thing your last woman had?.
- Well, the...
- The moustache...
But then you broke up, right?.
The circus has taken him!
It fucking looked good on him...
He's laughing, he's laughing!
Fuck you,
who's got a decent woman here, huh?
- For me, my father... for me!
- No, the rubber one, Fox...
- Cingi!
- Yes?.
Who will sit on the tandem?.
- The room...
- Of course, the tuba.
And the...
a puna!
- Zsuzsa.
- Not Saci?.
- Zsike?. - Klára.
- Zsuzsa. - Samantha.
Teacher.
She teaches deaf mutes.
- Yay, that's good! That's very good!
- He is...
Uh, boss, but the deaf,
he can't hear anything!
Shut up, Sanyika,
stay here.
Oh, so that's why you can stand the tuba...
You are so lucky
chicano, it won't bark back!
- You suck, don't you?.
M Indenkl: No way! No!
- I really like it.
CSOKl: Sure.
I found...
He hid it in the evening, found it in the morning.
I'll be back, Lalika.
Bye, guys.
I am tired.
Do you have a non-alcoholic beer, Lali?.
Van.
Then throw it the fuck out.
Give me a real beer.
Oh, Lalika, Lalika...
What are you happy about, Gaben?.
Life is good.
Really?.
Fuck.
Here you are again,
how could you rot down...
No shit...
It will be good to see if
watch my mouth...
FERl: Right fucking here!
- (singing)... my fucking cock!
FERl: That dirty, lousy...
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm thirsty.
Hi.
Hello. What a nice aunt.
Are you wearing panties?.
You are sweet.
She wouldn't call back!
Relax, Sanyi.
The lady is beautiful, but still
we can't lose our poise.
By the way, this is Sanyi,
and not a dog.
Mr Sanyi.
I am not afraid of dogs.
I was attacked by a guard once...
Really?.
And?. Animal or human?.
You're funny.
Diet Coke it is.
LALl : There is already one.
FERl : Finally!
FERl: What, are you from Ukraine?.
- Sanyika, where is the opener?.
- I can't see!
- Me neither! Shit.
- You have two minutes.
Workman: Two minutes...
Or one.
(mobile phone ringing)
Yes?.
- Also, please provide a kitchenette.
- Listen, I'll open it.
I just can't find the opener.
Now listen to me...
this is not the...
classic cognac, but still...
it might do the trick.
- Here you go.
- Can you take it there?.
- Where to?.
- It's for him.
You should help him too,
don't stand there looking! Hey!
You ordered by phone from six meters away?.
Don't fuck with me...
- Does it matter to you?.
- Well, yeah. I do, actually.
Sanyika!
Take it to the sympathetic gentleman.
FERl: Have fun with your mommy...
- I got it, I got it.
Can I have a drink?.
Sorry. Sure.
Voilá!
Do you practice a lot?.
LALl: You brought it out of me.
FERl: Fuck you!
SANYl: Oops! Ooh!
Fuck you!
- Sanyika!
- I delete.
- You're stupid...
- I'm Sanyi!
Sanyika, come on! Come back!
Come back here!
SANYl: He said I was stupid.
GlTTA: How much will it be?.
Coke is free.
Cognac is 50 000.
FERl: Humour Harold.
Now here's fifty thousand for the obvious
for your shitty cognac, which I didn't even drink,
and here's about another pee...
- for this shit.
LALl: Why?.
Hence the horns. Count the money,
and let's get out of here, all of us.
- You go too, little Gitta!
- Hello!
SANYl: Hello!
You, then who the hell are you,
to be so cool?.
You see what a big idiot you are.
I'm telling you to count it.
And you ask me.
I will send you the cleaning bill.
- Hello!
- Wow, fuck.
You are stupid.
How can you rot!
I seem to be ticking.
Filthy drunk drivers.
But I can't stand them.
- Hi Lalika!
- My respects to the gentlemen.
- Lali! Can you give me a little hubi?.
- On duty, Mustache?.
Why?. It helps us to pursue sin.
Alcohol test, Lalika.
Well, we're stopping someone,
you know, he's smart, you know.
We'll drill it, there's something,
blaming the probe for being wrong.
Well, I'm going to take out
a control probe, blow it.
If your belt is the colour of
I'll take away his license.
BAJUSZ: You cannot hide from the law!
You can't!
- Could we have one more?.
- Well, you could.
Let's say there is an excuse!
If he drinks because of his wife...
Wow, that's tough!
Why, no?.
Don't let the woman jump in!
Fuck!
Don't you have to drink?.
Don't let the woman make fun of someone!
Fucking hell!
Hi, Teca.
You listen to me...
Why are you teasing me with,
for mowing my lawn like shit?.
But you can't swing around... You!
Lalika! Don't you have a TV?.
Yes, I do!
- Yes, but it's shit as it is.
- You know, 'cause a buddy of mine
has one of these things,
that shit is this... you know, this...
- round shit this is, come on...
- Umbrella?.
No! Amin is on TV,
is the plate...
- Parabola?. - Yes! Fuck,
that's it, I couldn't think of the name.
So he can do that.
Or that I can.
Because after all, the College does not hoard -
and the prize money is long gone,
the child grows out of everything
so a little addition...
- And you can bring it.
- Sure. I can get it for a friendly price.
It's got it all coming.
"Enimalplanet."
Many tiny animals. Well?.
Well, let's say,
there are plenty of animals here.
There is more.
Dubai 2: women with chador.
- It doesn't make it stand up.
- There's porn!
Well...
Let's say it gives you a hard-on.
Na egs!
(sex sounds)
- Shall I go?.
- I'll go.
Okay, I'll be waiting.
Shhhh!
- Hi Mari.
- Hi.
Look, Lalika.
You know how much I love you, but...
Even then we had no future,
when...
we thought we had...
Technically...
never.
MARl: This is Tibi.
TlBl: Hello.
- I'm Tibi, Burjáni.
- Hi.
- Sorry... Lajos Kakszi.
- Sorry... That.
Not problem.
Sanyika, turn it off!
This is your world.
Be...
You are very happy.
I wish you...
- Can't I watch?.
-... then with Sanyi.
- No! Don't misunderstand.
- It's too late.
- How?.
- I...
I held on for a long time...
- Hello, who are you?.
- Hi, I'm Tibi.
I kept you... technically, but...
SANYl: Wow, your glasses are beautiful!
- Have you ever seen pussy?.
- I haven't.
Hello!
I'll get your mother's two-door car out here...
and the...
and the ear-photograph,
that you wanted to do when you were an old man...
when you still had plans!
TlBl: It's OK.
- You bastard! Now you had to do that?.
- Oh no, don't misunderstand.
- No need to misunderstand
- I did not misunderstand.
- But you misunderstood!
- What do I misunderstand?.
You know that very well!
But I don't know, tell me!
- Why, what can I say, you don't know?.
- Okay, I can go now.
I'm leaving, listen, it's the easiest.
Leave me alone. Okay?.
- Tibi! - No! I hate it,
I hate it when you call me Tibi!
- Tibi, this is...
- Don't tibitz me!
- And where will I live?.
- Why, where have you been living?. Tibi!
- Leave me alone!
- I won't leave you alone!
SANYl: Hi Tibi!
- This is true.
- Goodbye!
SANYl: Wow, that's a nice car you have, Tibi!
TlBl (yelling): No Tibizz, fuck you!
Fuck you.
CSOKl: Lali.
LALl: Hm?.
CSOKl: Imagine that,
what happened, Lalika.
Well, what?.
CSOKl: I can do
make a mouse out of straw.
- This is stupid.
- But really...
- A mouse made of straw?.
- Yes. I can from yesterday.
I had straw in my hand,
and string.
I wound it, I wound it,
and suddenly there it was.
Pure mouse.
You're kidding me, right?.
ClNGÁR: Mouse?.
CSOKl : Why?. I can't be a genius?.
LALl : You, what's so brilliant about that?.
CSOKl: Are you stupid?.
A mouse made of straw?.
Wait, Chocolate, maybe we're all
crazy, and that's why we don't understand.
So you made a mouse out of straw,
and you're happy about it?.
- In fact, you think that
you're a genius?. - Yes.
I see.
You, by the way, know,
what a mouse is made of?.
Well?.
Fuck you with a mouse.
What the fuck do you do with thread?.
CSOKl: Straw.
Ornament. Get it?.
ROKA: I'm interested! How much?.
LALl: The straw mouse.
Az.
Such a Fuck Shui thing!
Chocolate!
There is no such thing as Fuck Shui.
Only Feng Shui.
Ok, now what?.
So far, you've fucked me,
because I can't think of anything,
just to drink.
Well, now I remember.
GABEN: The straw mouse?.
Why, fuck, now what... what...
I'm glad I didn't think of the bun, huh?.
Then fuck you, I'd be a genius,
because I'm feeding you, huh?.
ROKA: Did you remember the bun?.
(they laugh)
Kiss her...
Do you know what you'll get
I'm going to remember one more time...
Here comes the bullshit, chicanos,
not a star.
But, the radio said.
Otherwise not a star,
it's a meteor swarm, you know?.
As it enters the Earth's atmosphere,
it heats up...
Ok' fine, leave it, I don't give a shit.
I'm going to sleep, chicanos.
Listen!
It's really there.
Look over there.
Is it this way?.
I don't know. Lali?.
- Nice.
- Fast...
Big...
ClNGl: It starts from the universe,
from the cosmos,
a small pebble,
a small piece of rock.
The coincidences...
Listen to me, the coincidences.
What is the percentage chance that,
that a small piece of the universe
that's when he's beating Kavics to death,
when he gets off his bike on the way home,
to relieve yourself,
because you've sprouted beans?.
What was the percentage chance?.
CSOKl : Well, at Kavics 50.
Either he falls or he doesn't.
(Chocolate laughs)
SANYl : Poor Pebble...
LALl : Chocolate, now you're really stupid!
SANYl : Wow, Chocolate.
GABEN: Fürtöske.
Are you sure we're going in the right direction?.
I can't stand it, come on!
The doctor told me,
I can't do this.
Hold on, Mustache!
Five days, then we're back on patrol!
After all, you only took an A, didn't you?.
Come on. You're fined a thousand a day.
But I can't even take five days.
That's one week.
Fuck.
ROKA: I tell him what's wrong.
Well, he got the money, didn't he?.
And he tells me.
the picture's not right on that five thousand.
I say, how-how is it not good,
I put it there.
Cause on that five thousand,
who is this stranger.
LALl : Who was on it?.
ROKA: Well, it was Gingar.
- Let's get out.
- Are you stupid, Moustache?. They're threatening me.
- They are not threatening you...
- Of course they are.
- Leaving the duty station...
- Well, almost.
- We would be nearby,.
- Of course.
Just taking a break...
ROKA: I'll tell the dude,
it makes a difference who's in the picture,
you're dealing with Mongols anyway, and they're
don't even know what a forint is.
I had a lot of
fake tapes with Cingi on them,
why rot there now
under the bed, no?.
He gave me a mark for it, brother!
260 000 for counterfeit forints
he gave me 80 marks!
You're an idiot!
I'm going to Germany to beat up whores.
- You get some very buffalo women...
- Yeah? - Sure.
- How do they change the lemur now, Lali?.
- Fine. Pretty good...
ROKA: What?.
What are you laughing at?.
Brand... German.
"Dojcsmark."
It's gone, you idiot!
When it's gone!
- What?,
don't you watch TV?.
No.
It's fucking gone!
Fuck me, when?.
- A long time ago. A long time ago.
- Son of a...
Wait, wait...
I have a buddy, no TV!
- Well?.
- 28!
One, two, three, tap-tap.
Bye!
I see you!
GABEN: Fuck me,
we came twice as much.
ROKA: Is it gone?.
Well, my friend, I didn't know!
That's it, that's it!
That's not it yet. Wait, come back.
That's no good, it's only 9, hey.
- That's 11. - All right,
but not 27. Come on!
Guys, wait.
- It's a bit very difficult.
ROKA: Hi! You, you don't believe me,
re-launch the brand!
You should buy it, right?.
No. Bye.
All right, listen, let's wait for it.
In case he fucks up, leaves the tuba
and doesn't notice.
Don't tell me.
I'm already exhausted.
If you blow into it again,
I'll kill him!
Relax! Relax! First performance.
- We'll listen now and never again.
- But to come to a funeral for this?.
- We are not normal!
- Well, it was a big fuck up, that's for sure.
- Are you happy, Cingi?. So are we.
- Well, he's my master.
My respects, my brother Gyula!
My respects! Youth?.
Nonsense!
ClNGl
You, should not help?.
CSOKl
You must not, you will be offended.
BAJUSZ: I don't have it...
I don't have it...
You don't have... Got it!
János Köveski,
- for many people,,Kavics",
GABEN: Fürtöske.
ROKA: What?.
- We're too late, Curly.
ROKA: Bald!
GABEN: Calm down!
because that is how they knew those who
loved, is no more.
I mean those who are
loved him, he didn't.
He was always happy to do his job,
or for some money...
-... in addition to,
- What are you doing?. Don't you say that here!
that you got from the gasoline...
but who hasn't stumbled,
we all have.
Although the deceased did not belong
to any denomination,
I would still quote
as the body-mind teaches,
"When you felt that
the last hour was approaching,
the Nabonite Rajah would go to the kufar,
would go to the devil... "
Pancakes.
(speaker gets excited)
- Well, fuck you...
- What?.
Nothing.
Cupid's spit hit the spot...
"He said to her:
put the beef... the myrrh... "
- Cupid's kiss.
- What?.
-,,,,...return the frankincense and the gift cédée..."
GABEN: Well, that's stupid.
Children, mercy!
(bell)
Goodbye... hurts...
(the bell stops ringing)
It's over, Sanyika.
The pain of saying goodbye.
And pain is...
Where there is peace, there is peace.
Where there is peace, there is peace.
There the family...
- He had no one... -... and steps
towards a full life without family.
As mayor, you were important to me too,
like all our dear citizens...
- Hi.
- who among us is going away from here.
CSOKl: What now?. He was looking at me.
- He wasn't looking at you, he was looking at me.
Anyway, I know him from somewhere,
I just don't know where.
POLGÁRMESTER: I'll miss you, Pebble.
CSOKl: Well, don't make me stop drinking,
- Fuck you!
- Children, mercy!
All right!
Work, bread.
Fuck you.
Miss you from your street, where new dentistry
and from your port,
which is now inland
and therefore worth much more...
- Poor Uncle Gravel has become so flat.
- Is he that flat?.
And you've meant more to us,
dear Kavics, while you were alive...
- because you're only halfway through painting the nursery...
ClNGl : Wow! Sorry!
(the musicians are tuning)
- Here we go.
- Fuck that.
MAYOR: To quote the poet...
-,,Flying is the heavy stone... "
- Great funeral so far!
Lalika, am I good like this?.
My mother is watching on TV.
- How is it, Gustika?.
- Kafa.
"Who knows where it stops,
(bell)
and who it hits."
He got you, Pebble.
God bless you.
Hello Gravel, you stone.
Poor pebble.
How flat.
CSOKl : Yeah, you could winkle with it.
- Lalika, where can you pee here?.
- I can't believe it, not again!
- I'm not going with you anymore
Yeah, Fox sucks.
Where are you running to?.
Shall we take a closer look?.
ROKA: As far away from Cingi as possible.
CSOKl: I want to see him! This is bullshit.
LALl: Come on, Sanyika.
CSOKl: You don't see a face like that every day.
- Well done on that, right?.
- Of course.
- This is me, after all.
- Of course it is.
- Will this be a problem?.
- No.
- Or do you?.
- Of course.
LALl: So, what?.
Come on!
ROKA: Well done!
LALl: Well done!
TlTKÁR: The Mayor
continues his sad speech.
So I ask the orchestra...
GABEN: Dude is swallowed by the ground!
Are you okay?.
DOBOS: No, fucking hell!
KLARlÉTOS: Easy Bear,
we'll protect you! Come on, come on!
- You idiot. Well, we want it out!
- Sorry, I thought you were the ones who pushed him in!
CSOKl: Are you stupid, chicano?.
Don't push me!
TROMBlTÁS: Me neither!
- What?. You two?. I'll milk you...
- Children, mercy!
- Now, get out of here! Get out of here! Come on! Come on!
Get me out of here
for fuck's sake!
CLARIFICATION:
Okay, I just thought I was pushed.
Chocolate, come and help me!
Children! Let's try to get it out!
The Mayor
will not continue his sad speech.
GABEN: Fucking hell.
ClNGl: Relax Gaben, we'll pull it out!
GABEN: It's not, fuck it.
My phone fell in your trumpet.
That's a room, isn't it?.
Wait, I can't reach...
DOBOS: I'm fed up, I don't play the drums!
My father told me what I drum...
Bear, you did not fall by yourself,
you were pushed.
What, faggot?.
Fellow hunters...
LALl: Who put it there?.
- Now let us remember with a salute
- to our dear departed Pebble.
- Have you seen the phone?.
ClNGl : Take it out, take it out!
LALl: Jesus, get it off him right now.
- Aim for the sun!
- Can't you pick it up?.
Oh, you're so stupid!
Let's try to move it a little..
Shouldn't you put fat in it?.
It makes it slip.
ClNGl: Where are you going now?.
- Okay, I just wanted to help him.
- Shoot away! Away!
- Hello, who is it?. - Who is it?.
Letette.
Come on, Guszti, we're leaving.
- Well?.
- Good.
I told you it was worth it!
Now, need a hit?.
Come on, cough it up.
You can't.
Cough!
- All right... - You look good,
You look like you've shit your pants.
- Good work, Mustache!
- Come on!
- You look great! You look pretty good.
- Well, better than you. Well, sports, you know.
- Oh, and Teca.
- What about Teca?.
It's Teca, not sport.
LALl: Cingi! Cingi!
- Yes?.
LALl: The girl, you left the girl!
- How?.
LALl: Zsuzsa!
Yeah, thanks, thanks!
DOBOS: I've had enough
I'm sick of this fucking life, just the drums...
the drum...
no personal life, no family...
Well, fucking hell...
SANYl: Queen!
- Boss, you see.
- I see, Sanyika, but this is no queen.
- I'll let you know if I see one.
CSOKl: What a girl... Such big cans...
Stop staring at me...
You've got to get a grip.
Maintenance?. Are you stupid?.
Cans this size...
Bitch Kanos Zoli...
This will also make you stand up,
when he's snowballing with his mother.
Well, a cave has been
I'd furnish it myself.
- Have you ever been with two women, Chocolate?.
- At the same time?.
No, in total...
What?.
You almost got bit, chicano.
Little guy almost
the end of the world...
Now, to Cingini...
It works for him.
For the stupid...
- Come on, Sanyika.
- I'm coming.
LALl: Hi.
Buenos Aires, Chicano.
SANYl: Whew, boss!
Look here!
A gift!
Ooh, what a lovely gift!
LALl: Uh-huh.
A gift.
LEVEL:,,I hope you find everything.
I've put the ties away,
you don't wear it anyway. "
SANYl : Boss, beer?.
LALl : Mm-hmm, thanks.
LEVEL:,,Wine in the armchair.
From Tibi. "
SANYl : I'll get it!
I'll get it! I'll get it for you!
You say, Chief?.
- Which one?.
- Queen!
No...
- Sometimes it was, sometimes it wasn't...
- Where?.
Sanyika, I told you a thousand times,
it's just a twist.
Turnaround?.
So, where there was and where there wasn't...
Where?.
Do you want a story, or
don't you want a story?.
Queenie!
- The King's wife, the Queen...
- The Queen!
...once he sent an envoy
to the shepherd mourning in the forest,
if he would come up to his palace,
but immediately
to the brightest room of it,
the diamond room, but at once!
Well, the shepherd did not mope for long,
whose name was Sani.
- That's me.
- That's right.
It went up hip-hop
To the king's palace,
and threw the king out,
he threw him out of the queen's room
and smelly, dirty, stinking, and lying in it.
its shiny diamond-quilted
in his duvet with a duvet.
- Pendered by.
- That's right.
Very close he lay
close to the queen, very close.
He also put his dick in there
to its shiny buttocks.
- To your bottom.
- That's right.
"Oh! Oh, this is it, this is it..."
- cried the queen.
"This is sublime!"
Well, from then on, the old king became
the shepherd and Sanyi became the king.
- Sanyi is the king!
- Sanyi the King.
And they lived happily ever after,
seven days and seven nights.
- One more time!
- There is no God!
Can I get you a beer?.
Then there is.
SANYl: Coming! Don't go to sleep!
LALl: Oh...
Queenie!
Well, the queen may or may not have been...
- Is it over?.
- Mm-hmm.
Turbo version...
- I'm tired, Sanyika...
- Give me back the beer!
Sanyika, Sanyika, calm down, calm down!
Good, good, good...
And then the Queen lived happily ever after,
and then she was no more.
He lived for a while, but then he didn't.
Hmm, how sad.
- How's that?.
- Sad.
NOTE: Our municipality
is organising a competition on Village Day,

Sue them!
Sue the whole gang!
Great fucking idea!
(shooting in the background)
- Hold on, Chocolate!
- You're right, Lali, sue him!
- Besides, you went to law school, didn't you?.
- Stop with this nonsense!
Six months in the evening, fuck you.
Then sue them tonight, Lala!
Lalika, I really think
you should try it!
I think you should go inside
to the municipality and protest.
How, Cingi?. At whom?.
- How much will an apartment cost here?.
- Shut up, you idiot.
Don't give up, Lali!
Secrecy, protest!
- Damn it, what am I going to do?.
ClNGl: Lalika!
I think right now
you should go there right now.
Fucking got it!
Scalpel!
Ombre, my man!
I'll invite him for you. Very hard.
Tell me about it.
These are crushed.
Yeah, no fucking good, he's sitting.
- Why?.
- He was protecting a guy, but they had a fight.
- And?.
- The guy's dead.
Okay.
Then I'll go.
Well, fuck you.
We need to shoot their kind of faggot...
What are these?.
Did I bring you these, Lalika?.
- Nice dress...
- This will be fine.
- Yes?. Thanks.
- We're driving, Lalika.
(Chocolate shooting in the background,
and yelling)
- Chocolate, stop shooting!
- Stop shooting!
Don't fuck with him...
- But you can't go off like that!
- All right!
Wé wé wé?.
- Period...
-... en.
Have a nice day!
Boss! Boss!
Have a nice day!
Sorry, I wish!
- Excuse me, I kiss you!
- Window!
Sorry...
Stay there, Sanyika!
- How are you here?.
- Fine. - Stay.
I like to be able to listen...
Here is the situation.
I have a problem.
There is... there is this area,
I am... Stay Sanyi!
I'm somewhere around here...
Well... I'm me.
There's the guy and there's the sign.
So far...
So far, it's pretty much clean, right?.
They came.
They want to come there.
Let's say, I'm legal legal legal legal...
I'd like to take this to the legal way
and I read that in it,
let's say a long time ago, in Roman law...
moment... terminus tecnicus,
right of possession.
If there are two Roman citizens,
and one of them...
Rome...
...think.
Well... Jusz.
Jusz Buffet.
Right, the bartender's right.
To stay.
The right of the bartender to stay.
It's like...
It's as if the...
A boat has two owners.
Get out of here, Sanyika.
Or stay, stay.
He can testify to what I said.
- Bye. - Okay, okay.
Now go, Sanyi.
So a boat has two owners.
One is a Roman citizen, the other is not.
The latter has a house in Rome,
but the other... doesn't.
Now, the one that doesn't,
has two sons.
One of them is blonde.
The other is a little taller...
The one that is blonde is black.
He's got a buffet, and a faggot upstart
wants to build something on that land.
Then it's for him, it's for him,
has the right to remain a buffet.
This, this... is this way...
please help me!
Please help me.
There is something in Latin for this.
Latin word,
I just can't think of it.
It's OK.
ID, 5 600 fee...
Ownership sheet.
I kiss you.
Are we suing, Lalika?.
Are we suing?.
- What?.
- Well, what is it?.
- Have you taken action?.
- All very....
Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
When everything was going so well.
Right, Sanyika?.
Did it go well?.
Hey! Small buffet...
... envious...
Why are they so jealous, huh?.
- Who?.
- The women.
What is this
"I want to be single" mania, huh?
The only...
What is a single?.
Which one is it, huh?.
What makes one?.
There is one of me. Yeah.
And there's one of you. Two now.
How many shirts do you have?.
I have a lot.
Neither asks the other,
what I was wearing yesterday!
I wonder why?.
Because I keep them in order.
Well I'm much more loyal,
than not. Don't you get it?.
Listen up, daddy.
So much disloyalty, so much loyalty...
Bullshit!
So much loyalty, so much disloyalty.
Sense of proportion, dad.
Understand?. Sense of proportion.
GlTTA: Konyakot.
- Hi.
- Don't give it to him, daddy, he doesn't like it.
GlTTA: I don't like you. Give me some brandy.
- Don't give it to him. - Kids,
make up your minds...
Don't give him...
Stop the car!
Listen to me!
I'm a bartender, you know...
So I'll give him a fucking cognac,
I'm sorry, I'll give it to whoever I want.
Absolutely. You can give it to anyone,
but not to him. Honey! Come on out, sweetie.
Fuck off, where's the cognac?.
FERl: Don't do that, girl,
you're my love. I love you, I'll give you a park.
GlTTA: Azt. And a clap.
- Oh, don't humiliate me, Gitta.
So why now...
Come on. Get him out of here!
- Gitta, listen! Get out!
- Beszari.
- Why are you a coward?.
- What?. I'm not a pussy, I'm just...
- Stop.
- How about it?. Huh?.
Don't do that, little girl.
- What?.
- Come on, little girl.
- Good to watch?. Good to watch?.
- Don't you enjoy it...
- Not good. Not good for me...
- You know you can't have me!
- What can't fuck you?.
- Fucking piss him off!
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!
But I don't do it,
It's your fucking girlfriend!
I'm not his girl!
- Hello...
- You're stupid, get out of here!
- Listen!
- What?.
- You son of a bitch, what are you doing?.
- Nothing. Listen, what the fuck did you do?.
- The bitch...
- What are you doing?. Get the fuck out of here!
FERl: Come here, you stinking bitch!
- Get out of here! I'm not...
You're ruining my buffet!
Stinking bitch!
Fuck, that's good,
that you stopped by.
The bitch... My dick!
TV: males are upwardly mobile
upwards with their iron tails,
- to the female who is willing to be herself...
- Hello?.
Boss!
- Hello?.
LALl : One moment...
I'm coming,
so don't fucking call me.
I see... Uh-huh...
I was once
been humiliated at this buffet.
- Don't you recognise me?.
- No.
And we've met before.
Not long ago.
And a long time ago.
Jerk!
Listen, for me
I'm having a very difficult day.
Stand back a little!
Tell me.
what the fuck you want!
- Do you have a hamburger?.
- There is.
I almost forgot,
I'm a vegan.
Fuck you.
Give me some milk.
- No.
- But there is.
- No. - But there is.
- Value. You know?.
It's in coffee, not in stupid.
I will report you.
Not EU.
- What the fuck do you want?.
- Don't call me that.
- But I'll show you. - But no.
- But I'll call you by your first name, you!
- I will destroy you.
- You're stupid for that.
But I will try!
Don't you recognize me?.
- You don't give up, do you?.
- No.
Are you not a local idiot?.
- But, local.
- Local?.
Well?.
- lgy?.
- Wait a minute...
Tilt your head back a little!
Turn right for yourself!
Wait, wait, wait...
just spread your arms a little bit!
Father, I don't believe it!
Great! Great!
Lift your feet...
Well, that!
Father! Well, you...
- Well?.
- Well... I don't have a fart!
Here you go! Listen!
Look here!
Bye! What do you want?.
Coffee?. No!
Sandwich?. I don't give.
Go away! Stupid motherfucker!
You get nothing!
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone!
It's all over!
I turned up! Do you understand?.
- Chocolate! Are you stupid?.
- Gaben! I don't believe it!
Watch out, or I'll punch you in the face
a strigula that's not true!
Why doesn't anyone come here?.
Sanyi, where are you?.
Here I am, Boss!
I am the king!
Lali and the Emperor, Boss!
Am I like that, Sanyika?.
Whoo-hoo, Chief.
Fuck you!
And that's you:
bibi-bibi-bibi!
Hello! This is for you,
sugar cubes! Here you go!
I'll give you a sandwich now...
Look at how...
fresh!
It didn't work!
LALl
Oh, Sanyika!
- Are you happy, Cingi?.
- I'm a little worried.
It will be nice.
- Lali! Can I still put some of this back?.
Easy, easy, easy, easy!
In my hands the style.
Paris... London... Rome...
- This is how they mow everywhere.
- Yeah, with scissors...
GABEN: Come on, Chocolate!
- Go on! Come on.
- How is it?. Good?.
- Stay! Get out of here!
- Take that chair! - Sanyi, come,
take over, then bring this shit.
Lalika! Do we have a mirror?.
Our mirror?. No.
ROKA: Jelly.
LALl: Yes, boss.
ROKA: Enough.
Tada!
Ready!
- Ready?.
- Yes!
Thank you, Fox.
And?.
Well... kafa.
Very cool.
All you can say is...
Oh, I'm so glad.
Zsuzsa will be happy too.
Groom!
Nana, not yet!
- Lalika, your palms are sweating!
- Yes?.
- How is it?. Good?. - What?.
You'll faint, father! Young, red.
His waist is like a rope,
breasts like two beach balls.
- Where did you get it?.
- From Mr. Bull.
- Are you tired, Sanyika?.
- So he makes a bar like this.
By the way, fuck it.
There is a small slot machine.
Winner. Well, not a winner.
The money is stuck. For you.
And that's good for him. I got this one.
- But where will the woman be?.
- Under the tuba.
I applaud two,
the tuba flies, there's the woman.
- Are you OK?.
- Yeah, fine. I'm fine.
- Are you sure?.
- Sure.
- Are you sure?
I'm telling you now.
Well, let's just say I'm putting it in an ostrich
my head or whatever it's called.
Thus. Now, wait.
No... all right, here we go.
Oh, I'm so excited.
Okay! Joke!
- Can I look now, boys?.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute...
And!
Oh, how beautiful!
- A little bachelor party gift...
- Look at that. There's the tuba!
Yes, the tuba! That's when we started doing it,
when you said you had this girl.
- In the spring.
- Four years ago.
- Yesterday.
- It doesn't matter now.
The small "desert island"...
really, is it padlocked?.
- Well, that's beautiful.
- Wait, wait, wait!
What else?.
Don't get me excited!
And... now!
- The bottom line!
ROKA: And... now!
How young?.
Can you get rid of the tuba?.
Stupid. He's not a child!
And now!
Guys! But it's not a woman, is it?.
Because, because Zsuzsa is... well...
Now!
Can you piss in a lake?.
I really need to!
Stupid! Is that always your problem?.
Get out of there!...
Don't fuck with me!
You know I have a kidney!
- Well, that explains everything.
- Now, I'm throwing out the Ganges.
Yellow River, you idiot!
Now!
(Chocolate yells)
CSOKl : Fuck you! Fucking hell!
FATHER: Are you putting it away?.
CSOKl : Well, who is the aunt?.
SELLŐŐ: Auntie, your grandmother!
- Queenie!
- Put me down!
- It doesn't look like it.
- I have arranged...
FATHER: Damn it!
CSOKl: Fox!
- Fuck you!
- Whoa!
Stop hitting me,
I caught it!
- Come on, bring it!
- Whoa, fuck you!
Well, not a child.
At most, a perpetual child.
I kiss you goodbye!
- Well done again, Fox.
- You Fox! How come the aunt came?.
I swear I don't know. I kiss you on the cheek,
how did the aunt get here?.
Mr Taurus says,
go see him tomorrow,
because with the non-winning machine
they killed the bastard.
Wow, she's coughing badly, poor thing!
Where to dance?.
ROKA: Cingi!
Thank you very much.
I think that
we'll take the aunt home now.
- Why?.
LALl: Chocolate!
- Sanyi! - Why?. Home?.
- I'll take you.
- How nice to have such good friends!
- Ouch! We love you, Tink! Friendship!
Friendship,,forevör" friendship!
- I love you, Cingi!
- All right, Sanyika!
- Sorry for the surprise.
- No problem! No problem!
Stop fooling around!
FOR ME: That's what good friends are for...
So that long lost dreams...
Can't someone do this with a different text...
or a sequel or something?.
Oh, my mother of God,
I feel so good!
- Son of a bitch, it stinks.
- Oh, fuck you. Chocolate, you farted!
- No... - Of course...
- Damn it, my eyes sting...
- All right, no need to tease.
- Don't fucking fart.
Especially not this big.
It's a convertible and
- you fucking phoned the whole thing in.
- Leave it, it's a bachelor party.
- It stops there!
- That's what good friends are for...
ME: Barely, barely, standing,
yet I vomit up to the wall.
CSOKI: My angel, my angel,
I love beer, wine and brandy!...
Cingi, stop hitting my shoulder while driving!
I asked you more than once...
... not twice.
What was that?.
- You, it's not the...
- She ran to him...
You listen! This is...
- wasn't that the Rezső?.
- Who?.
Fuck you...
We fucking hit someone.
I said, we hit someone,
fuck you.
I don't know. Guys...
It was like seeing Rezső's face.
I saw it too, Gaben.
Suddenly it was in front of us.
- Clatter! We hit him!
- Yes?.
- Yes.
- Because you tapped me on the shoulder.
That's why we hit him, you idiot...
No! We didn't hit him!
But then you did see
according to this! No?.
With. How could I have seen you swinging there
that fucking newspaper in front of my eyes!
And Chocolate farted so much,
like they were dissecting!
Fox, you laughed in my ear!
Well, it is possible to drive for someone,
when they're being laughed in the ear?.
You did hit him after all...
All right, fuck it,
I'm going home now,
there is no blood,
no body, no nothing!
What are you doing?. Where are you going?.
You have to go to the police, Gaben.
I wouldn't go in, guys.
I got a gun.
- Do you have a gun?.
- What?.
What now?.
I've always got it, fuck you.
- You know how many aggressive
Fucking hell!
- We hit a policeman with a gun!
- Boss! Boss! Boss! Hat...
Well, I shit myself!
- You need to call an ambulance.
- To the cap?.
Fucking hell!
Okay.
Listen to me.
Relax!
It was an accident.
We go to the police station,
and report it! Come on!
How the fuck would I go in?.
I drank so much, my blood's on fire!
ClNGÁR: Eat something.
- Ruszli. It absorbs it.
- It's no use saying it if you don't have it.
- No.
- Don't you have to chew roasted coffee?.
- Good against onion smell.
- Against onion smell?.
- Does it stink?.
- Then eat bread and meat.
- Wait, there's bread and frozen sausages.
- Give me something for fuck's sake,
- that soaks up this shit.
- I have a scone, Gaben.
Here! That's good!
Wait! It's delicious with cucumber!
ClNGl: Does milk absorb it?.
CSOKl : Of course, it does.
What is this?.
- What the fuck is this?.
- I got my watch! It's not ticking.
- Sticky, sticky.
- Mustard. Mustard.
- So. Put the mustard on it.
- With cucumber.
That's right. That's for sure...
- There you go! Ubi!
- Ready for milk?.
- Mehet.
- This is good too.
- Are you sure it will absorb it?.
- This?.
- Absorbs.
- Suck it up.
In a Trabant?.
Six of them?.
Five.
That's a lot.
There are four of them.
- Four of them.
- So?. How many?.
- Heten.
(Lali whispering): The seventh was the aunt.
What?. Make up your minds already.
how many people were in that car.
- Heten.
- Heten.
- It doesn't matter how fucking many of us there were!
- Stupid Fox just disappeared! There were seven of us.
There were not seven of us.
Shut the fuck up.
You fuck me!
Fox was the sixth!
- Has?.
- The fifth was him!
- Who?.
- Leave him alone, he's been drinking.
- Evett.
- He didn't drink, he ate.
- Chocolate, say something!
- I don't fucking dare.
- They know me here!
- There you go. I ate.
Evett.
And er...
Whose car is it?.
Mine.
Yes?.
May I see... the papers?.
Of course.
Are you Oszkár Hodobay?.
- No! This is Lali, the Boss!
- Stay there, Sanyika!
No. Sorry, no. This is Ossi...
I got... got... bought it from him.
Did you rewrite it?.
No... Not yet.
Buying and selling?.
Well, I...
we didn't do that.
More.
Who was driving the car?.
They think I am.
But there were...
disturbing circumstances.
Well...
This made the car falter.
I once telephoned a museum.
But I was a little drummer then.
Quite a small drummer.
- To fucking life.
- You were a drummer boy?.
In Zanka.
In our private sector.
What is a melancholy death
fringed with blood
you came here for his dick?.
Well... I'm going to fingerprint
on you.
What death happened?.
Accidental death.
- Where is the body?.
- There isn't much...
What are you playing at?.
What death, what fart?.
Listen to this.
I'm going to take out a piece of paper, see.
And I'm going to write that word here,
the first word that is spoken.
And if it doesn't make sense,
then I'm going to go on the basis
I'm opening an investigation against you.
And if any crime
happens around here today,
I'm gonna put it all on your neck
I'm going to sew it around your neck.
- Rezső!
- Rezső...
- Hello, Orpika!
- Hello Rezső.
Like this!
- What's up, guys?.
- Boss! He's alive!
What's up guys?. You came in,
or did they bring you in?.
- Hey, they're good kids,
But what do they want?.
Just... we brought this back.
- And... we won't bother you any further.
- Keep up the good work.
- Bye!
-... goodbye!
Foo!
Well?.
Boss!
Carousel! Let's go on the merry-go-round!
- Now Fox, I'm going to kill you.
- You sneaky little fox.
- Why?. Am I the only one who could have brought it here?.
- Where the hell have you been?.
- You left me in the shit with the cops!
- In for a ride, Lalika.
Do you think it came here by itself?.
Look how beautiful it is.
And it works, Lali!
- Sure, get him the hell out of here!
- You said it yourself!
- What?.
- Now don't make me the idiot!
Now, you're taking it away
all your shit, okay?
- What?.
- Everything. Everything, everything, the rubber,
the wreck, the microwave,
the donkey, everything. Okay?.
But look, Lali!
It's hardly used! Look, helicopter!
- Helicopter?.
- Boss! Can I have it?.
No. Get him the hell out of here.
Lali, it's only a few days,
and then it'll kick in, believe me!
Well, and then I brought this one,
so it wouldn't squeak...
Anyway... radio.
A gift!
- The kettle's on!
- Listen up!
Six years ago
you brought me a kilo of cherries.
You said you were leaving it here,
you put it in the corner,
trees have grown, I cut them down, it's fine.
All right, fuck it.
But this is the carousel,
it'll never fucking
will not take root here!
Is that clear?.
No, no, not rooted!
Wheel.
Chicky, chicky.
Girl, girl, girl.
Csacsi, Sanyi,
Bitch, Tiger.
Rezső, poor Rezső,
when will we bury him?.
- Rezső is alive and well.
- How come?.
Oh good, he's alive!
Oh, congratulations, thank God!
Isn't it great that
I didn't go with you then?.
ROKA: Look!
- What's this vursli?.
- Happy!
- Pack your bags!
Give me a peach.
And maybe a plum.
What is it, Chocolate,
having a fruit day?.
Oh, and cherries too.
Gifts! How are you?.
They're hungry for frozen frothy sausages!
You were great, by the way.
I'm telling you,
I'm still from there
I never got out so fast.
- And I've been there more than once.
- Not twice. You idiot, what are you eating?.
What do I know?.
Something yellow. Peas?.
Relax!
My mother cooks things that...
You, fuck you.
It's at least ten years old.
And my mother was eight.
Fuck that.
Chemical vegetables.
Suit top,
shiny stepping...
I'm dressed up, too.
So, when will they marry me?.
Only in the afternoon.
But I thought I'd check it out first...
- Lalika! Really embarrassing?.
- Not embarrassing.
- Not embarrassing... It's fucking lame!
- All right, stay there.
Lalika, I met your dad,
and he said they're taking the bus to lunch...
Hello Fox.
- Hair?.
- We'll leave that for now.
Coward!
- Well, this is...
- Can't I leave it here, Lalika?.
Goldfish.
You can wish for three.
Really?. Wait...
Take it to fuck, take it to fuck,
take it to fuck...
Now... This is not you, Lali.
You're like,,of course my brother,
I'll find a place for him... here."
Stay here,
I'll be right back.
Damn it! Man!
What have you done to me?.
- What did I tell you Fox?.
- That you don't want to see these here.
Ok, I say it's hepped.
Well, but you can't see it here?.
Here... it doesn't bother you, does it?.
That's not what I said.
Okay, maybe.
But it doesn't bother you here, does it?.
You listen to me. I've had enough,
I can't take it anymore.
- Fuck, I can't take it anymore!...
- But...
- Nothing ever changes,
fuck you! - But no...
- Well, it's been the same for years.
But not here...
Nothing ever changes!
I tell you, "Don't bring it here".
You say, "Good",
and then you bring it here.
I'm always, always about the same thing
talking about the same thing...
...and you are the always
the man who always brings everything.
Don't you want to for once in your stinking life
be the man who takes something?.
Well, look at that, look at that,
should we take that?. See?.
That should be taken away. Look at that one.
See that?. Hi, Dad!
- Kisses uncle Kakszi!
- Take everything away from here!
I want nothing more with you
talk about it, take it away...
- So, what do you think?.
- Hey, jappers!
- Hello! Micsubicsi...
- I'm a little lost.
They are so hungry,
they've turned yellow. Give them something to eat!
I told them that he was a romantic outlaw
Hungarian tavern.
- All the best!
- Konichiwa.
To the soybean. Sa...
Mouth that way.
- Get on that!
CSOKl: Hi, chicano.
- They are moved. They're spending mine...
- It's on, Lali! Chocolate!
Get off on it!
Boss!
I'll change dollars for you,
"ferstésztdu"?.
- Boss!
- Get the money, though.
This is mine!
My carousel!
Filed under. Tied.
- What are they eating, Uncle Lajos?.
- What do I know?. Sushi.
- What?.
- Raw fish with vegetables. Didn't you know?. Right?.
- With bread?.
- The hell with it. Rice.
APA: In '67 there was a similar
Mongolian group in '67.
Of course it was a delegation...
- You're stupid, Chocolate, what are you doing?.
- I know, with rice.
Fucking hell,
give it back! Sorry!
Sorry!
All right, listen to me,
well, enjoy your meal.
You are a complete idiot...
- What?.
- The yellow peas.
I told you!
- Negere... negere...
- You shouldn't do that, children.
What is negere?.
Get out!
I'll take the carousel! Leave me alone!
- Hey, hello! - Hi,
Nice to meet you.
- Cingi!
- Hello, hi, I'd like a hamburger...
- Get the money for the carousel!
- In a minute, Lalika!
- Go ahead, sorry.
- I'd like a hamburger, please...
- One...
- two pancakes...
Who closed this?. Lali!
This is Laliland!
"Big revenge!"
Two scones... What did you ask for?.
- Stop yelling, you idiot!
- Let me in, it's a fucking emergency!
I fell asleep, fuck...
What?. What?.
Get off the carousel!
ClNGl: Dzsentlemenek!
Hello! That's mine!
Wait a minute, kids, what is negere?.
You know what... smile!
- I also... Here you go....
- Is that a hamburger?.
Listen, I'm here now.
Give me some time.
Help me!
Hold this!
- Should I grease it?.
- What's going on, Lalika?.
Wait a minute!
Listen, dude, is this the fast food place?.
You're a little slow.
- Gifts!
- Landing, chicano!
I have no pistachios, but I have peppers.
Children! Wait a minute!
A little patience!
Laliland, Father!
Boss!
We don't have to introduce ourselves here, do we?.
No. Is something wrong?.
- Rezső is alive.
- Very much so. That's exactly what...
Early millennium
an extraordinary event...
- Excuse me...
- Your colleague won here. He almost quit.
Gambling in a coat of arms?.
Shame. We reconstruct.
Lottery tickets?. Where are they?.
How did it happen?.
Lottery ticket!
Here you go.
Kaparok.
- Let's say he paid.
- Lalika! I'm sorry, but I...
- But this is good for you.
CSOKl: Cingi!
- My tandem... I'm sorry.
- There's nothing. It's fine.
Forgive me,
but now... Cingi!
Fuck... sorry.
Boss! Boss!
What, Sanyika?.
(voice-over)
Nest holder, for stork...
Don't be the winner!
SANYl: Boss! Boss!
You, have you seen the Boss?.
Wait, I'll hide this here!
I don't have it Boss!
Looking for... Watch out, watch out.
Boss! Boss!
I don't have it Boss!
Oops. A letter!
See?.
I got a letter!
Boss!
No problem...
Oops! Five thousand!
Fuck!
Put the brakes on, little man!
Four hundred,
is four hundred...
You're still scratching... like it?.
Well, 36 400.
Huh?. Please.
Well... from what?.
This is... Hey... This could be it,
it could be, it could be more.
Look at that.
Interesting from an immigration point of view...
Okay, I didn't see it.
What, Sanyika?.
Is there a problem?. Others?.
FERl: So, what's up, little bartender?.
Come on, let's have a little chat.
FERl: Sit down, nice and easy.
LALl: What are you doing here?.
I said... why...
FERl: I love the air.
- Why do you come here?. Leave me alone, okay?.
Wait a minute.
Three options are given.
One is to bury you today...
-... or next week
I'll bury you. - Who are you burying?.
You. Or you can accept
this milk. Understand?.
In fact. You know what?.
Let's pretend that...
let's say I take one,
and you'll only get 990.
Understand?. I count, for each number
you lose a ten. Is that cool?.
- We...
- Good. So now it's just 980.
That's what you get for this shit.
Got it?.
- You're buying...
- I will. Nine hundred and seventy.
Which is now only worth 960,
because that's the way you're dropping the tens.
So now, you can just
950 and now 91 0.
- Well... - Yes?.
- You just said,
to jump by ten
and here after 950 you said 91 0.
I see you're listening.
900, 890, 880...
Listen, wait,
let me think about it.
You can think quite freely,
it just went down to 870.
- For you. And now the 860...
- No, wait. Just give me a minute, okay?
- There are not so many. 850.
- Wait a minute!
- And 840.
- No, don't stop!
- 830. - No! It's yours!
- For 830.
Not for 830, listen,
I've already started.
- First I started nodding.
Over nine. - What did you do?.
- Don't laugh, I started over nine.
- Over what?. How much over nine, dad?.
- How much?. - 91 0.
- 91 0 your mother.
Here's the 900, here, put it away...
Hi.
Come back and be the doorman, okay?.
Spartacus!
Swim!
Get out of here!
Well my friends!
This is the Gitta housing estate!
You can take photos. Na.
Welcome to you all
in my paradise!
I will show you my dreams,
my brothers and sisters.
Well, I'll be...
an 80-apartment apartment building,
on this part, here by this little road,
here will be the wellness,
and here, by the little bridge,
there will be the fitness.
Something is wrong here,
where the hell is there a bridge?.
Hello Boss!
Something is wrong here.
No coffee?.
Lali, Lali papi!
- The bridge. The bridge, the bridge, at the bridge.
- What bridge?.
At the bridge!
Well, it's not here, my boy.
Not here. This is not the lake.
That's over there by the Nador,
there is no...
What?. Fuck you!
- No coffee?.
- What the hell did I do!
Who the fuck put it there
that fucking sign?.
Fuck you!
Please... I left it here
my camera, for certain reasons.
At the end of this there are no tourists.
An interesting milieu.
Na... The influence of Asian culture
on the life of a micro-community.
But, let's take a closer look.
I told you it was
will start!
HANGOSBEMONDÓ: ...three,
two, go ahead.
Hey!
I don't know how it is,
but something's not right! Do you understand?.
- Let's get out of here. Head for open water.
- This area, it's not mine! You understand?.
I do not know whether
who put my sign here,
but I'm not going to build here, you understand?.
This is not my area, you know.
LALl : But?.
- Well, it's yours, Laller.
What do I know!
One and one and...
Let's get a move on!
Water strider, my brother!
Water boy!
Don't mess with me,
fuck you! Get out!
- Youth!
- Folly!
- Fuck you, fuck you!
- No! I'm fine!
- Get my money back!
- Relax, we're going with the flow!
You know, it's good for me now, you know?.
- Fuck you, fuck you!
- Don't fucking touch me!
Rot where you are,
you dirty, filthy bastard!
- You're gonna get fucking killed!
- Are you not afraid, Lali?.
- I don't have a gun!
ROKA: Why are you so nervous?.
LALl: Whatever?.
CSOKl: Chew on a pebble.
Water boy, dude!
Water strider...
Wow, we are sinking...
Fuck, our money's getting wet!
ClNGl: Boys, boys!
I'm late for the wedding!
CSOKl: Fuck you!
Don't do it!
LALl: Are you normal?.
It's all mud!
- Zsuzsa!
- Vivien!
GABEN: Cingi, go to the edge!
GABEN: Go outside, that's...
Fuck, I can't swim!
FERl: You are finished!
You are dead!
HANGOSBEMONDÓ:... thank you
for your participation, thank you for being here.
A big round of applause for everyone.
It's over gringos, we've made ground.
Beer?.
GABEN: Rowing here?.
(Chocolate laughs)
GABEN: How deep is this?.
CSOKl : It's as deep as we can go.
(Everyone laughs)
GABEN: Well, well...
- My small ship.
"Egsön!"
Five fucking milks!
Fuck, I stepped in it, motherfucker!
Five milka.
- Look at that!
FERl: Damn you, you little bastard!
GABEN: Fuck is he laughing?.
- He likes my little ship.
Are you crazy?.
Well, I kind of expected it.
FERl: I won five million!
- Bouncing and jumping.
- Damn you, sink!
SANYl: Hello!
FERl: I won five million, here you go!
I don't believe it,
it's been pissing ever since...
But strange, you hear?.
How quiet has it become?.
SANYl: Boss!
- Boss!
LALl: Go ahead, Sanyika!
SANYl: Where is the Tiger?.
SANYl: They are not visible,
then we can't be seen?.
SANYl: Boss, look, there it is!
SANYl: There you go!
- Shit, there it is!
SANYl: You took.
-,,I've got acid."
- How big?. I'll buy it.
- Well, you're an idiot, Fox.
CSOKl : Very much so! (laughs)
GABEN: You open, Lalika?.
Once we get out of this shit...
MlNDENKl: Oh!
ROKA: Fuck you!
ROKA: Meat tower!
Fuck, I can't swim!
GABEN: Who gives a shit!
Hang on!
(cars honking)
AUTOS FlÚ: Hey, Snow White, listen,
don't you know what's over there?.
So let's get settled in and...
settle in for the long haul,
Here you go.
- So we stay?.
- Why do I have the bathroom?.
(everyone laughs)
LALl : That's it!
