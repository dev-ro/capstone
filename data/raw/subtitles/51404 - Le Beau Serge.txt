Handsome Serge
Hello Tine!
- Hello Christine.
- My little Francois!
You haven't changed a bit.
Wait I have to get my bag.
Have you got anything for me?
Thanks! Hi Francois.
Thanks Michel.
I recognized him.
Back for a spell?
Yes...for the winter.
With a Swiss label.
No it's the one in front
with a Swiss label.
Where are you staying?
At Chauniers. Our old place.
The house is falling apart.
You'll catch a cold death there.
Shall we go up then?
Why it's Serge.
He wouldn't recognize you
anyway. Drunk as a fish!
- Let me carry it...
- No, no.
What did Christine tell you?
Nothing, honest...
Maybe she was right.
What happened to Serge?
Search me!
- He's in a bad way.
- You can say that again.
Back for a visit, Mr. Bayon?
The place has changed, eh?
- A little...
- Well take care of yourself.
Yea, don't worry.
I'll be fine.
Who was it?
That was Rita Perrault
No kidding. She's changed.
She's 12 years older.
Married with 2 kids.
It didn't agree with her.
Oh, she's still not bad.
When I think back...
Say weren't you a little
stuck on her?
What a laugh.
Doctor still live over there?
Sure. Same old phoney.
It's changed, huh?
We are fed up that's what!
What about Serge?
Serge's married too. Recognize
the old geezer with him?
Old man Glomand?
Yes, but now he gets drunk
4 times a day instead of 3.
Serge married his elder
daughter, Yvonne.
- You remember her.
- No, I don't.
Kid stuff. She was 12, brunette,
scrawny, homely.
Over there is where the
butcher, Renaud, use to be.
He's dead. His wife took off
to Aubusson with another guy.
His son is down the street.
We get our meat there.
Look! They're still there.
Hey you remember?
We sure had fun.
Hollered our lungs out.
Wonder what was so funny?
We had to do something.
Why did Serge marry that girl?
Can you smoke?
Sure. What did Christine
tell you anyway?
She said you were sick.
I was, but I'm better.
Tell me more about Serge.
It bothers you, eh?
Sure it bothers me. He used
to be such a terrific guy.
Why did he marry her?
Pregnant. Only slept with
her a few times...tough...
Have they got any kids?
No. They had one, but he died
at birth. Abnormal. You know
- a...
- a mongolian?
Don't know what you call 'em.
Wait. Do you suppose that's
why he drinks?
It helped. Now they're
expecting another
and he's always drunk.
Hello, Mrs. Chaunier.
Did you have a good trip?
It's young Bayon.
Knew it right away.
Well, I'll be...
Have I changed that much?
Sure. Of course you've
changed.
All of us have changed.
I'll show you to your room.
Bring the suitcase, Michel?
Sure. I'm coming Mrs. Chaunier.
Good thing you came here,
because your house...
It's a wreck! Your parents
didn't take care of it.
They're going to sell it.
Soon everyone will be gone.
Here's your room.
You've got a view on the
school, OK?
Where do I put the suitcase?
Bed's fine. You'll rest well.
Thanks. I'm fine now.
Even so, you have to rest.
Help you with your things?
Thanks, Michel will help me.
OK, Michel?
Now for meals...
Anything you say, madame
We eat around noon and 6.
Fine then.  See you later.
It's a good bed all right.
Any other boarders but me?
You're nuts! Who'd come here?
Well we use to have fun.
Who are you kidding?
Guess I'll take off. Coming?
I'll rest up a bit.
Don't worry. I'm not dead yet.
What was wrong anyway?
Lungs. Summer in Switzerland
and I'm going to spend the
winter here.
Got a little TB, eh?
Nothing much. I have to take
it easy is all.
You sure came to the right
place.
Say, you look in the pink
next to Serge.
With Serge it's different.
He wanted to leave and study
architecture.
He had scholarships in school,
even passed his exams.
He was disappointed. I knew
I'd be a baker.
I had no illusions.
A philosopher, eh?
Well, I'm going.
See you after dinner?
No, no not tonight.
What does Serge do?
You mean for a living?
He drives a truck for a
wood-merchant. Well see you...
Yes, thanks for the help.
Glad you're back.
Yes, pop. If you want I can
make a palace out of your hut.
...an honest to God palace.
Drink it down, you old bastard!
...a real palace I can make.
Serge, it's me Francois.
Good old, Serge!
What's the matter?
He's crying.
Are you Francois Bayon?
So your Francois Bayon?
Want me to help you?
We're use to it.
Who is the young one?
The 2nd daughter, Marie. A
real devil.
Changes boyfriends everyday.
Lives up on Mathubert with her
father. Want to eat?
I'm not hungry.
- Not sick are you?
- No, I've got to tidy up.
- Leaving already?
- Going for a walk.
- And breakfast?
- I'll have it later.
No, I just want to know where
Serge lives.
You want to see him now?
He really hung one on
yesterday.
Down the street at the end...
Dieudonne's house, remember?
Am I distrubing you?
I wanted to see Serge.
He's asleep. Come in.
- I'll wake him.
- Let him sleep.
It's not for you...
He has to drive the truck.
You have to go to Prefonds.
You're big and ugly.
Boy, was I drunk!
Thought I was dreaming.
- Why'd you come back?
- To see you.
To hear old Christine talk
thought you were a goner.
You look fine.
I was sick, but now I'm better.
- Had your breakfast?
- No I'll have it later.
Chaunier's coffee is lousy!
Whose is this?
For me, but take it.
I'll make more.
I'll help you.
What's eating you?
Don't you know Francois?
You were crying on him
yesterday.
Me crying?
You mean I was really bawling?
Blubbering like a baby.
- I was drunk.
- That's no lie!
What do you want?
I'm looking for pop. When I
woke up he was gone.
Who cares about Gloumaud.
Let him be!
And don't look at Francois
like that.
- What do you care?
- I do care.
I can take care of myself.
- You don't know her.
- Oh, let him talk
Give me some bowls.
Don't tell me your drinking
coffee.
Eat all you want.
Why'd you come here for
Gloumand?
I thought you two were
drinking together.
I'll tell you all about it.
- Tell him about what?
- About me.
my life and yours too...
and Marie's...and your father's.
When are you expecting the baby?
For January!
A nice little baby.
A nice little baby. Like the
first one.
Stop it!
- A present from your father.
- Stop it, Serge.
You'll see.
Ok, come on. Let's go.
Going out naked like that?
I was going out naked.
Some breakfast you've had!
Always the funny man, huh?
Keep it up. You were kind
of dull at first.
I didn't have a chance.
- What do you think of me?
- Why does it worry you?
No but, I'm not as stupid as
I look.
What is there to say? Things
just aren't the way I figured.
I'll see you up on the square.
Coming?
He's crazy.
You've gone off your nut!
You're so touching!
What'd you talk about?
He's not very talkative.
Come on, what's the matter,
Francois?
Timid I guess.
Thought you got over it.
Hello. Five gallons please.
Thought you got rid of me, eh?
I admit, you've got me
puzzeled.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Wait...
Ask if they've seen pop.
Gloumand has come yet.
Francois. Breakfast again.
Why do you do it?
Listen, I like wine.
Lay off!
- Serge listen.
- When I need you, I'll whistle.
Poor Francois. Looking for a
good deed.
Watch out, boy scout. I'm going.
What's the matter with him?
Nothing. That's how he is.
How'd he get that way?
Search me. Walk me to my place?
Maybe Glomand came home.
Are you coming?
What did he say about me?
- That all depends.
- I mean usually.
He said you were his only
friend.
How did he say it?
Sometimes he was happy.
Sometimes it would make him mad.
Worried about what he thinks?
No, but maybe I've changed too.
Well I think you have.
But you didn't even know me.
Sure I did.
Chased after all the girls.
How old are you?
Seventeen.
Want me to kiss you?
Come on home.
- Your father...
- He's not there.
- You don't really know.
- Sure I know.
But you were looking for him.
We'll see if he's there.
No, he's not here.
When did you start?
Two years ago.
Who with?
- I know anyway.
- So tell me.
With Serge. Wasn't it with
Serge?
I thought so.
His wife know?
Oh, we only did it once.
I'm asking you, does his
wife know?
Yes. He told her.
One day he was drunk and
told her.
We should leave. Glomand
will be back for lunch.
Afraid of him, huh?
Why do you call him Glomand?
It's all the same. Glomand
or pop.
They use to say he wasn't
your father.
Mind me saying that?
You look at us like we were
insects.
Don't you like anybody?
Sure. I like everybody.
Why'd you say that about
Glomand?
Because...because it's the
truth.
Are you very sick?
Frankly, I don't know. They
won't say anything. I was.
I was afraid I'd die.
He's not my father. Everybody
knows, I think, except him.
Why do you live with him?
Somebody has to take care of
him.
Whose your father?
Ma wouldn't tell me, even
before she died.
Serge says she doesn't know.
Heavy day?
- You're dirty.
- I know.
It's flithy work.
Serge. Serge my darling.
Lay off me!
God what a life.
What a stupid life! When I get
up I wish I didn't have to think.
And now he's back. And what
have I got to show?
- That I'm rotten clean through
- Forget about him.
Are you happy, you fatass?
Living like vermin?
What must he think?
Move your ugly puss.
Well Francois.
I'm glad you came to see me.
- I just got here.
- Are you better?
Yes, I came to rest.
Good idea. Were you very sick?
It's all over now.
I prayed for you.
How are things going otherwise?
I was working toward a degree,
but I had to stop.
What do you want to do?
I don't know. Make a lot of
money, I guess.
- I thought you wanted to teach?
- No.
You even wanted to become a
priest once.
Yes, I remember. I got over it.
What do you think of the village?
Found it changed?
Not so much the village, as
the people.
I know. There's nothing to be
done about it.
They're getting bogged down.
Oh, I tried a few things.
A children's club.
It lasted two months.
And the others?
The fellows my age. Michel.
Serge.
What can you do? They've all
lost their faith.
...Faith in themselves.
Are you still a believer?
But you didn't come this
morning.
I didn't know there was a
service.
It's All Saints Day, Francois.
Didn't you hear the bell?
I was...taking a walk. I
forgot it was November first.
It doesn't matter.
You saw my flock. For All Saints
Day service, six old ladies.
And when the Lord claims them,
I wasn't able to make them come.
I couldn't even keep them.
Maybe there was something to
be done.
But nobody did anything!
You don't have the right to
blame me.
Well, did he make a nice
sermon?
Why'd you say that?
He likes to make sermons. He
made one for me once.
Didn't you Father?
- Are you drunk?
- Not very.
Isn't it true, Father.
You made a nice sermon?
If I did, you needed it. Or
at least I thought you did.
You think I don't understand
you. I know what you all think.
You despise me. You won't listen.
You've never listened to me.
I want to help you. You won't
let me.
Here we go again!
You have no confidence in me
and I did all I could to help.
Yes, yes. Goodbye.
See what I mean, Francois.
What can you do?
Well, goodbye. Come and see me
when you get bored.
- Him and his fine talk.
- Quiet, Serge.
- Worthless.
- You use to like him.
Who cares? Look there's La
Truffe he's come into some dough.
- Hi ya Brummel.
- Hi Francois.
Hello, you recognize me?
Sure, you haven't changed.
- Hello Jacques.
- On Furlough?
And how! He's got eight rebels
in one bush!
Recognize him, Jacques Rivette.
Sure, so you're doing your
military service?
Naw, he's a professional.
- Yep, volunteered. Cigerette?
- Their Algerian.
So you like the army?
It's good sport.
Well fellas, I'm going to eat.
See you around.
Oh, they'll be around.
I got two weeks.
- Come up to the hotel with me?
- Nah, have a drink?
I'm late. Mrs. Chaunier will
be furious.
Let's have it up there.
It's one o'clock. Don't you
ever eat?
You're right. Lets go.
No. Well have a good lunch.
He can go to hell. You with
me? Let's go.
Yvonne, is Serge in?
- What for?
- I want to talk.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
I want to help him.
He left right after lunch.
Ever since you came he's been
in a daze.
I'm a friend Yvonne. I want
to help.
Just leave him alone.
He's not happy.
Especially since you got here!
Nobody asked you.
You just take care of Marie.
That's all I ask. Leave us
alone.
Hello Doc.
Old man Laroch is dead.
- Terrible weather...
- Yep, give me a shot.
I've had enough, enough...
Enough! Enough!
Is Francois in?
Francois Bayon. Is he in?
No he went out again. He was
going up to the Mathubert
You wanted to see him?
I don't know when he'll be
back. Have a drink.
Your father in law will come.
Got to see him.
All I know is he went up to
the Mathubert.
Got to see him.
Francois, I have to see you.
Must be at Marie's. Doesn't
waste any time.
Maybe I'll catch up. He walks
slow.
I always had to wait for him.
He used to call: "Serge wait
for me."
What must he think?
I was a fool an idiot! The
shame of it all.
The shame. Seeing him come
like that.
I should have begged him. And
that business with the priest.
I've got to explain it to him.
The priest and his prayers.
I need strength, not prayers.
Courage, courage. Pray to have
courage.
I'll go this way.
We once believed it was 20
yards higher.
Old man Laroch will be here
tomorrow.
Me to some day.
Not like Francois' uncle,
buried in Africa.
I might as well face it.
That baby ruined everything.
Lousy kid Glomaud's daughter
had.
I would have had something
to hold on to.
2 years and I could have
passed my exams.
Yeh, even without my degree...
...the three of us would have
gotten a fresh start.
It's this rotten place.
Yea, that kid ruined it all.
From Glomaud's bitch of a
daughter.
All those kids that are born
just to die.
Be a good friend, Francois
and help me.
Francois listen to me.
You've got to do something.
Help me!
I was cleaning up. Glad to
see you're sleeping late.
I get up when I wake up.
You shouldn't go out with
that girl.
You think it will tire me?
Yes.
- There's no sugar.
- It's on the counter.
Come sit down.
Oh, so you're here.
You hungry?
It's ten. I've already eaten.
There's a dance tomorrow.
Will there be a crowd?
There always is. Will you
dance with me?
Pop was dead drunk this
morning.
Nobody home.
No, Serge too has been drunk
all week.
He's avoiding me.
It's because of Yvonne.
I knew it, she hates you.
It's not that she hates me,
it's complicated.
She wants Serge like he is.
She feels inferior to him.
He doesn't love her.
I don't know.
But I do know.
But what's the difference?
You finished?
Coming with me?
Why'd you talk of Serge?
For no good reason.
Are you coming?
I came to get you.
No, I've got to see Serge.
I can't understand you.
You don't have to. See you
later.
Pop'll be home.
Ok, but I've still got to
see Serge.
Leave Serge alone. He doesn't
need you.
- And he's not there.
- I'll wait for him.
He often misses lunch.
Ok, it's stupid to keep
insisting.
I like your dress.
I made it myself.
I better without it.
See you at 3.
Ok, but I think you're crazy.
- Maybe I am!
- Completely.
But I like my comfort.
What does that mean?
Nothing. Just a city joke.
She looks up here for you now?
It keeps her busy.
What's the matter. Hiding
around corners now?
Looks like it. I wanted to
talk to you.
Ok talk.
- Not drunk?
- Not yet.
Listen, I think there was a
misunderstanding between us.
Yes, I think I've been a
blundering fool.
Well at least you haven't
changed. Come on home.
No I'd rather we talked
outside.
Suit yourself.
You don't like Yvonne, do you?
You see, underneath it's flithy.
Why do they leave it then?
Oh, they'd have to drain it,
clean it. Someones got to start.
To come back to Yvonne, I
think...
I think you should leave her.
You're crazy. But, I love
Yvonne.
Maybe, but you're not happy
with her.
Listen, you don't get it.
You're just groping, eh?
Got it figured so that all the
small pieces fit.
You don't even know Yvonne.
She's better than both of us.
Listen to this: I was mad at
you all week.
Because I needed you and I
couldn't find you.
If I drank like a fish all
week, it was your fault.
Can't make an omlette without
breaking eggs.
Who wants an omlette?
I happen to like them.
Well, after that I'm going
to eat.
How's it going with Marie?
The little bitch.
She said you had some hangover.
She'll say anything. She's a
bitch. See you this afternoon.
No, uh, you stay home with
Yvonne.
Oh I get it. You skunk.
Ok then, have a good time.
Hey, Serge.
Oh, nothing.
Want to eat, Mr. Francois?
Sure if it's ready.
He your boarder?
A friend of the family?
Messing around with my daughter.
A friend of the family.
Haven't you been messing
around with her?
Buy you a drink?
Have a drink, I said.
No thanks.
That's enough!
Then buy me one.
Dirty skunk!
I said buy me a drink.
Leave me alone.
Sleep with my daughter and
won't buy me a drink?
I'll have you know she's a
minor.
Leave me alone.
Keep your hands off my
daughter you hear?
The laws on my side. She's
my daughter.
Ok. I'll buy you a drink. Mrs.
Chaunier will serve you.
I don't want your drink.
Lay off my daughter you hear.
She's my daughter so lay off.
Sure.
She is my daughter, isn't she?
Say that she isn't.
You know she isn't.
He said it, said she isn't.
In front of a witness.
He said she's not my daughter.
Come nosing around our place,
will you?
Well, you've got a surprise
coming.
Goodbye, everybody.
Don't worry about him. Just
talking.
Oh, I'm not worried. But did
he know?
Nobody could be sure. But he
acted like he didn't know.
But you couldn't reckon on it.
Who told you?
Marie.
Don't let it bother you.
You like pate?
He wanted me to say it.
What's wrong?
He snuck in like a snake...
Let go of me! Let go!
It was your fault.
Why did you tell me, huh? Why?
Three years I've wanted her.
They've found Glomand. In
the cemetary.
- Drunk?
- Yea, tained.
They are taking him to the
doctor.
What happened?
An attack. Nothing a little
medecine won't cure.
A nice stiff drink, eh?
What did the doctor say?
It can't be serious. They
would have told me.
- What a fuss.
- Oh, it keeps them busy.
Well, I'm going downstairs.
I saw you coming.
Glomand just told me.
How is he?
You scared him.
Nothing serious?
Of course not. What got you
into it anyway?
I was fighting mad. It's
disgusting.
It's not disgusting. It's
almost normal.
After all, maybe you are right.
I don't understand you.
Things are so different here.
You saw how they live, didn't
you.
Do you realize he held himself
for three years?
Just think, together all that
time, knowing she wasn't his.
And what about Marie? Did
anyone ask her?
That's all she was thinking
about.
- It's not true
- Sure it is.
- That's horrible.
- What's horrible about it?
It's not horrible. It's
normal.
What makes you that way?
- Everybody's that way
- That's not true.
You're just like animals.
You have no purpose in life.
You're right. Where could we
find one?
We make just enough to keep
from straving. The earth is granit.
We work because there is nothing
else to do.
Look, most of them live at
least 3 miles away.
Soon the snow'll be up to their
knees and they'll want to learn.
Yeh, we're animals. No one
gives a damn.
Go away then?
To the army? Like Jacques?
No, that's no good. Besides,
someone has to stay.
See what I mean?
I think so, yes.
We need something to hang
on to.
A guy whose never seen people
walk won't try.
- Quite right.
- Ok, make fun of me.
To get back to Marie.
I bet she'll come to the dance.
For Novemeber, it sure is
hot. Bottle of wine, please.
All alone Michel? No partner?
Bah, all the girls are...
Hi! Serge was asking for you.
Was he? Where is he?
He's dancing. But you'll find
Yvonne on the bench by the window.
So Yvonne's here to?
She's watching him.
Marie here too?
You alone Michel?
Francette is here!
Here, you kill it!
She just got here.
You're late Francois.
Give me 100 francs.
Thanks. Now your arm.
Show it on the way out.
Very practical.
Pig! Dancing with Francette.
It bother you?
Don't cry, you can have her.
Have a drink.
Poor guys, they are thristy.
I was looking all over for
you. Shall we dance?
- No.
- What's wrong?
You want to leave now?
Leave me alone.
What's eating him?
Search me.
Ok stay that way. You'll look
like a minister.
C'mon and dance.
You look tired.
Look! Went to Yvonne for
comfort.
Everything ok?
Yvonne is tired.
We just got here.
Can't we go, Serge?
Too bad.
- Be reasonable.
- Go to hell!
Always Yvonne. I've had a belly
full of her.
You leave her alone.
And me too, see?
Want to go outside?
I said scram!
Do you get me?
I'll knock your...
Are you gonna lay off?
I said leave me alone. Go away!
Gonna lay off or not?
Can't you see I'm fed up.
Answer me!
Mind your own business.
Gonna lay off me? Are you?
You're strong.
I need a drink.
You sure showed him, Serge!
I guess the city guy had it
tough.
Did you get a load of that?
You ought to be a boxer, Serge!
Go away! You see how they are.
You'll get hurt if you stay.
Go!
What a bore!
- It's him again.
- Yes, I saw him.
- What do I do?
- Show him in.
I can say you are asleep.
I can't be asleep all the time.
No, please show him up.
- Am I distrubing you?
- No, not at all.
I came twice. You were
sleeping.
I just want to see you. How
are you Francois?
- Fine.
- You don't look it.
It's a little cold, but I'm
ok.
I haven't seen much of you
lately.
I don't go out much.
They say you stayed locked up
2 weeks. Is it true?
You're well informed.
You know, they told me about
the dance and everything.
I'd like to give you some
friendly advice.
It'd be better if you left.
Why?
You're doing yourself more
harm than good. You're pale.
I'm not leaving.
But why? You came to rest and
it's obvious.
No, I said I won't go away.
Why? What's holding you back?
It can't be that girl.
No, something else. I just
can't go away now.
Why can't you?
They need me.
Francois, I think you're a
little over excited.
They don't need you or anyone
else.
I think they do.
Didn't you see what happened
when you tired to help them?
That's just it. I'm beginning
to understand.
I was wrong to lock myself up.
They don't care about words.
What do you mean?
It's thanks to Serge I understood
I think they need... an example.
And you're going to give it
to them?
Yes, me! Are you going to do
anything?
You're a fool! Who do you
think you are? Jesus Christ?
Do something! What are you
going to do?
I don't know. That's why I'm
waiting.
For what? Shut up like this.
What are you hoping for? Want
me to tell you? You're humliated.
Your fine words are nothing,
but pride.
So what? What do I care you
call it?
All that counts is to do
something.
You were right. I was wrong
to shut myself up. That's over.
I'll find a way to help them.
I don't care what you think.
Gathering wood?
Yes, twigs to light a fire.
- Let me help.
- No, I have enough.
You shouldn't. It's tiring.
We need a fire.
When's the baby due?
Next month, plenty of time.
Let me take that.
I'm sorry about what Serge did
at the dance.
Forget it.
He was drunk. When he got home
he was in a state.
You know, Yvonne it was my
fault. I was clumsy.
Drunk, he'll do anything.
Sure, wouldn't he gather some
wood?
He didn't send me.
What's he doing?
He's got his work.
He still drive a truck?
No, not anymore.
I don't know what he does now.
He never comes home.
He spends the night in a trance,
sleeping like a log.
I'd rather not see him.
Because of the child, he always
use to scare me.
He remebers the first one and
would make those awful faces.
I'm sure this one will be fine.
The first one didn't waggle so.
Sometimes I talk to him and he
answers me like a living being.
And the doctor?
They all think he'll be like
the first.
You still love Serge?
Yes, it's unbelievable, huh?
I used to admire him.
You remember how he was.
Now I want to keep him,
protect him.
You know I hated you, since
you first arrived.
I thought you were to blame
for the way Serge is.
I thought you wanted to
seperate us.
Yvonne, Serge isn't as crazy
as you thought.
You were right. Last month we
had a talk.
I advised him to leave you.
Poor Francois.
I thought you were above this.
But you love him too.
Yes, I thought I was doing
something right.
He sure made us suffer.
He's hurt me so many times.
Why is he like that Francois?
Because he's suffering himself.
What's the matter?
It's you! Come down quick!
Yvonne told me to get you.
She's in labor.
- What's going on?
- Nothing, nothing.
- She's at her house.
- The doctor?
The doctor, she didn't say.
It's me Yvonne. I'll help you.
Be brave.
That's better?
You stay there, I'm going to
the doctor.
All right. Cover up, it's
snowing!
- Is the doctor there?
- No he isn't.
Well, where is he? Where?
At Mathubert. Glomaud had an
attack.
Look! It's snowing again.
Won't you come in?
No, couldn't you come to Yvonne's?
She's in pain and there's no one.
It's too cold out.
Where's the doctor?
He's at Glomaud's. I'll get him.
- Send someone else.
- No, I've got to do it.
- Who is it?
- It's Francois.
Yvonne's in labor.
- I can't leave.
- I came for you.
- He must go.
- What about him?
She can't have her baby alone!
- Get out!
- When I get there, it'll be over.
Last time, I hardly made it.
This time it's different.
Doc. Listen to him.
No. He can't make you well.
He's never made anyone well.
I can help you, give you a
shot.
- Hurry. Please hurry.
- Go to Yvonne's doc.
Leave me alone with my Marie.
Well, if that's the way it is,
let's go.
You'd better cover up.
Leave me alone.
He's got a suicide complex.
Shut up and let's hurry.
Christine, I need a big pan of
boiling water, fast.
I thought you weren't coming
back.
Easy now. Yell if you want.
- Where is he?
- I don't know, probably some barn.
He'll come. But we don't need
him now.
- I'll go
- Go where?
You go back to the hotel,
Francois.
That's enough. You'll catch
your death from cold.
You stay here.
There you are!
Wake up!
It's your wife. Your baby's
being born.
Come on. Wake up. Come with
me please.
Stand up!
Do it for me!
Stand up!
Leave me alone.
In the other room.
The forceps. Quick.
Wake up, Serge. Wake up.
It's a baby.
How is he?
You can't ask for the moon.
He's no glant.
Oh, I thought...
You hear him?
