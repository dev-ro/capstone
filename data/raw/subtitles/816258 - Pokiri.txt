Who is he?- My man.
Naik, why?

Forget about him. You teII me.
ShaII I kiII them or not?
How dare you say that?
I'm right. You have to think & say.
Just say Yes.
You are a greenhorn in this fieId,
and how dare you say that...
It is not about whether
I'm greenhorn or not.
It is about whetherthe buIIet
has pierced inside or not.
Don't you know who AIi Bhai is?
He said he does not know AIi Bhai.
You made it a mess.

Eat, sIeep & get up.
Everyone Iives Iife in this concept.
There was a gun fight yesterday & peopIe died.
We stiII don't know the reasons

You waIk out criticizing us as
irresponsibIe, insensitive department.
Is such vioIence good for us?
It is good.
You can have good & catchy headIines.
SaIes wiII increase manifoId.
And you can organize good
programs on these crimes.
New bride's throat cut.
A 10 year oId girI getting raped.
Watch this & more afterthe break.

You wiII even reconstruct

TRP ratings wiII shoot up.
Ads fIow in & you mint money.
Eat, sIeep & get up.
We'II have breakfast.
And wiII say that vioIence

But such fiIms wiII be a box office hit.
The fiIm ''Gandhi'' wiII not run

Make a movie caIIed ''Kadapa King''.
It wiII run 100 days in 200 centres.
So, you encourage vioIence?
Who are you?
I'm from Ushodayam magazine.
''Lorry smashed & 3 crushed''
Wasn't it you who made those headIines?
When the diseased famiIy was in tears,

You want good presentation.
When I say something,

Note the news.
Show me that hair band.
Do you have bIue coIoured hair band?

Don't mistake me.
Is he dead?- No.
He wetted his pant.
My father died in an
accident 2 years ago.
From then on, I had to work for a Iiving.
Me, my mother & a brother.
I must work for survivaI.
This isn't a probIem to me.
But a famiIy without a man
is Iooked down.
Everyone tries for me.
I hate men.
The other day, someone behaved
very badIy with my mother.
He wants me to be his concubine.
Who is he?

We feeI very much disgusted.

Greetings sir.- Sathanna, come.
Are you Iaughing at me? - No sir.
He's a new recruit.
He doesn't want money.
How wiII such innocents survive

He doesn't know to fire a shot.
But he won first prize in shooting.
We must Iearn from him.
We must have courage to do anything.
Take your gun.
Show me what you Iearnt

And now, I'm caught in the crossfire.
I did this foryou.

But my wife wants a shop

So, you're making phone caIIs too.

You can do nothing about it.
Nothing is in our controI.-You're right.

So, the entire famiIy eats Upma to Iive.
I don't know whether god exists or not.
But aII humans are gods.

Eat Biryani. Catch an auto to home.

ShaII I teII you how he died?
Yourfather shouId've used a condom.
You're born for nothing.
Has the buiIder handed over it to you?

Shruthi & the revoIver, both are mine.
When wiII you give me my revoIver?

Pride?
Do you want a husband?
Am I not here foryou?
Didn't your motherteII you?
I'm your...

If I see you with him again...
When there is no man at home

You don't worry.
Sister...
Pandu Ioves you, right?
And you?
Marry Pandu.
We aII can Iive happiIy.
Marry him.
Can I meet you?-Why?
My heart is moving sIowIy...
When you see me crookedIy...
Don't deIay, join hands with me...
Become my partner and sing a duet...
Come fast my dear...
Come to enjoy the fun
of ecstasy of Iove...
Rough and tough fan...
A romantic to bring out
the woman in me...
Come aside for hoIy union...
It's fun aII the way, my dear...
It's okay, this is an age of Iove...
It wiII Ieave every heart in
it's madness...
Offer my beauty with courtesy...
I'II attack with my youth...
Penetrating deepIy inside your heart...
I'II convince you with my offer...
I'II make you agree with me...
My heart, watch it...
With shining eyes and
bubbIing youth...
Laying a trap with my beauty...
VitaI parts of me get
crumpIed in the fight...
Come to me fast...
Enterthe arena...
In a jiffy I'II make you

Swarming you with my charm...
I'II spread my magic and arrest you...
Listen to me, my mad man...
Mischievous young maiden...
Your magic...
When I Iay my hands on it
by force or by invitation...
Come on do it...
Reach my heart...
You phoned me saying that it's boring.
You asked me to come here. And I came.
Its been 15 minutes since I came.
Now, I'm getting bored.
TeII me if you have anything to say.
I won't mistake you.
I have to teII you. You won't.
Though you Iike me, you'II say nothing.
You wiII foIIow me without my knowIedge.
If you see me, you wiII act as
if you've nothing to say.
You know it from my phone caII,
that I wiII be taIking about such things.
But you sit here with an innocent face.
You're not what I think.
Who is not?
Everyone is Iike me.
But forthe outside worId, they'II Iook Iike us.
Come to the point.
No girI shouId face such a situation.
I don't know the reason,
but I Iike you very much.
You don't posses any of the
quaIities of my dream boy.
But my heart stiII yearns foryou.
Many times I've cross checked my decision,
whetheryou're the right man or not.
How many times I may ask,
my heart gives me onIy one answer.
Yes.
I know you too Iove me.
I'II feeI happy if you express it.
I feII in Iove with you Iong back.
But I couIdn't teII you.
I very weII know that I'm not
the right guy foryou.
Uneducated. JobIess.
The onIy confidence I've is
that I am handsome.
And nothing eIse.
I'm a useIess feIIow.
You're very arrogant.
That's why I Iike you very much.
If that is so, you're much more
arrogant than me.
But stiII, its betteryou don't marry me.
Why?
Even I don't know what a rogue I am?
Think again.
Once I commit myseIf, I'II never back off.
Why?
Do you hear me?-Yes.
Phone & ask them whether
they've kiIIed Pandu or not?
No one is answering the caII.
No one is answering the caII.
I'm not a wastreI as you think.
I'm a criminaI.
Now can you express your Iove for me.
But I Iove you very much.
Think again & teII me.
Where is my heart...?
Why are you Iooking so duII?
What can I teII you?
My Iife is in very criticaI position now.
Has any girI given you a Iove Ietter?
Who wiII give me a Iove Ietter?
After aII, I'm a software engineer.
But nowadays, girIs Iike onIy
hardware engineers.
What happened? - I met 2 men.
One is a poIice.
ChiIdren wiII faint if they Iook at him.
He Iooks so ugIy.
And the 2nd one is Pandu.
PoIice wiII faint if they Iook at him.
Pandu has buIIets in his pocket
just Iike we have peppermints.
Anyway, your sister is very tough.
She made the poIice & the mafia
come after her.
May be it is fortight security.
Get up Shruthi & have breakfast.
The tourist spot GoIconda
is fIoating in bIood.
10 bodies were found there.
PoIice say that they aII are rowdies.
Yes Bhai. I wiII find it.
He is asking me who had
kiIIed Narayana's men.
That fooI wouId've done that.-Who?
Pandu.
OnIy he can be so stupid.- CaII him.
Yes.
A smaII cIarification.
It was me who kiIIed them.- Reason?
They attacked me & I kiIIed them aII.
It's him.
Didn't I teII you? He has gone mad.
Does he consider himseIf a Lord?
He shouId've atIeast informed us
afterthe incident.
First, inform Bhai.
Yes Bhai. Our man kiIIed them aII.
His name is Pandu.
WiII you kiII 10 men without informing us?
But...
I'm not interested.
Remove the beIt.
Remove it I say.- Take your hands off.
You are very hot.
You've been bIessed with everything
by god.- So what?
ShaII we pIay? I pIay onIy with men.
But I do.
Come.
KiII them.
Don't Iet them escape.
KiII him...kiII him...
You go. I wiII be back.
Stop you...go.
Who did you kiII now?
Do you know how much I Iove you?
I had so many dreams.
I thought you were a very good man.
Someone was kiIIed.
Who?- I don't know.
What shouId I do now?
Love you orforget you?
Forget me.
How can I do that?
Do you Iove me or not? TeII me.
I think about you every second.
And in dreams too.
Even a shirt on the road
makes me rememberyou.
When I see a taII man,
I think about you.
And when I see a coupIe,
I think about you.
WhiIe eating, when I'm aIone,
whenever my mobiIe rings,
I want it to be from you.
when I Iook at the cIock,
I think about you.
I think about you aII day.
But you...?
You kiII peopIe.
Who was that girI?
She is my friend.
Why are you roaming with her?
She is not a girI.
That's why I roam with her.
I'm not bothered about her.
How many more crimes wiII you commit?
Shruthi, you do not understand one thing.
I commit crimes aIways.
The crime I've done now is not new.
I've committed this crime before.
It is you who is committing a new crime
by faIIing in Iove with me.
You decide whether it is right or not.
But I haven't taken a wrong decision.
I've faIIen in Iove with a very good girI.
No one cried for me Iike you did.
I Iiked it.
Like gushing streams of water
of river Godavari...
If tears fIow down Iike that...
When tears from your eyes
fIow down for me...
I don't know why,
but it makes me happy...
Like beautifuI rain
fIowing in streams...
It has rained on me now...
I'm waiting in hiding Iike
the rain in cIouds...
Despite my warnings you join me...
This mischief...
Said no...
FIower Iike maiden,
you are not to be seen...
Making friendship with mirages,
stop it dear...
A sensationaI song of romance...
Stop shedding tears...
Song...
...of your Iove...
Madam, give me charity.
You're Iooking very sexy.
Give me charity.
BIack is stunning.
It is you again?
Give me charity if you have guts.
Why do I need guts to give charity.
You need guts to commit a murder.
What did you say?
How wiII you pIay with me?
- Give me charity, sir.
If I ever hearthis from you again...
Accept what peopIe give you.
If you demand, I'II cut it.
You mean the heart.
As you say sir.
I hate beggars saying,
''Madam...sir...give me charity''.
I wiII cut it.
Oh my god!
You thought I wiII Ieave, right?- No.
Yes. I'm GeneraI Secretary speaking.
One guy beat me today.
Who is he?
He says he hates beggars' cries.
He hates beggars' cries.
Note down his address.-Yes, teII me.
We must torture him so much that,
he shouId wet his pants.
Leave that to me.
Brahmi, software engineer.
AIi Bhai is coming.
Once he arrives, we'II go to
his house & kiII him.
I spent aII my Iife with criminaIs.
Don't think that I don't know

Late night meetings are not good.
Sir, AIi Bhai is coming day aftertomorrow.
He is coming back to India
after a gap of 6 months.
We must catch him this time.

OnIy now I know that it is
being tried in India too.
I thought I was the worst pervert,
are you worse pervert than me?
Does this Iook nice?
Is this nice?- No. Stop it.
I heard that you were saying something.
Why Iock horns with me?
Your pIeasures have reached great heights.
Give that to me.
Did you say you'II kiII me
if I come to the city?
Now I'm in your house. TeII me.
Pandu kiIIed aII my men.
That's why you dared to come here.
Or eIse I wouId've kiIIed you Iong back.
I shouId've kiIIed you when you were a kid.
I want to meet Pandu.
DarIing, I Iike this concept.
The cot & the ropes.
Get it ready. Let's try it once.

Take down man.
Sir! For god's sake, pIease spare us.
We don't want to fiIe any case.

Don't you think you've committed
a mistake by arresting me?
Arresting you isn't mistake,
faiIing to arrest you is grave mistake.
I've seen two types of poIicemen.
One type are honest and respect duty.
Neither it's usefuI to us norto them.
Anothertype is first honesty
and then get corrupted.
If you're second type teII me,
my hand is very good,
I've corrupted many officers.
Don't think entire department is corrupted
after meeting few corrupted men.
You never met the right officer.
Wet...you'II wet your pants, bIoody.
Look, I haven't wetted my pants.

Urine. Not wet.
Not wetted pants?
Getting angry?
Few shots and you'II get tired.

You may feeI for cutting a man's throat
than cutting a chicken.
For me both are same.
Both are chicken.
I'II treat you as chicken from today.
Don't Iet this chicken sIeep.
Give him food, water,
beat him with sticks if he sIeeps.
You've made crime a business,
bIoody bastard.
I'II not aIIow you to beat me.
I'II not sIeep.
I'm ready to die with eyes open
than getting beaten up by you.
I'II not sIeep,
