I am you.
I'd like to feel what you feel...
think what you think.
I want to suck
every part of your body.
Nothing about you disgusts me.
- Recently...
- There are moments...
- ...I dreamed I was inside you.
- When I want to stop being me...
- I could feel inside you.
- So I can be you.
You are me.
I am you.
I love breathing you.
So do I.
When will I get my gift?
What gift?
The one you have hidden there.
I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do.
- No.
- Yes.
- I've got no idea.
Yes, you do.
Give it to me!
No!
Give it to me!
Stop!
Don't open it yet!
- I'll kill you!
- You're an idiot!
No!
Don't open it.
Are you sure you want to do it?
Yes. Aren't you?
I'm surprised.
I didn't think you were serious.
You said it too.
Yes.
- Forget it.
- No, wait.
Are you sure?
It's very romantic.
Forget it.
Are you sure or not?
I think so.
Yes?
Yes.
It's over,
don't think about it anymore.
What are you doing?
Undress.
Are you sure?
What's wrong?
Are you backing out?
No, I'll do it.
Undress.
I love you.
And I love you.
Don't force it. Relax.
Bye, love!
Stop it.
- Be quiet.
- Get off.
- Mom?
- No, love, it's your aunt.
I forgot some papers,
but I'm going now.
'Bye.
LOVING
- He's taking so long.
- Stay another day.
No, I'm sleeping at home
even if it's on a scaffold.
- I told Pablo already.
- It isn't so bad here.
- Or so good.
- That's gratitude!
- And it'll stink of paint.
- I love the smell of paint.
Laura, will you show us
a photo of Carlos?
- You want to see Carlos?
- Yes, I do.
- And so does your mother.
- Of course.
Look.
He's gorgeous!
That's at his grandma's birthday.
And what's that?
- A suckling pig. Isn't it like a cow?
- Yes!
- Have you invited him on Saturday?
- Yes.
- Are we going to meet him?
- Yes, we're so lucky.
We want to go to an amazing place
that Carlos knows.
Great. When?
A weekend.
- Who with?
- Carlos and me.
Laura, we've been here three months
and all I hear about is Carlos.
Why not meet up
with people from school?
Or invite them on Saturday.
Call Juan.
Juan?
His mother says
he's coming for a few days.
Who's Juan?
- Her "friend" from the village.
- No.
- Oh, no?
- What's this?
- Look who's here.
- Great!
- Well, are we all ready?
- Yes, please, take them away.
You bitch.
I don't like the view either.
But painted like this,
it looks bigger, right, Merche?
That's true, it does.
- You see I painted the gray you liked?
- Yeah.
It's turned out really well.
- It's kind of rustic.
- Industrial style.
Does it need a coat of something?
- Maybe a varnish?
- Yeah, but...
You've just seen each other!
I'm so happy
to have your semen inside me.
It's like you hadn't left.
I don't know
why I couldn't control it.
Hey, don't worry,
my period's due any day.
- I am you.
- And I am you.
I can't talk.
I'll text you. Kisses.
I love you.
What is it, Dad?
- How was yesterday with the faculty?
- Fine.
Did you have Civil Law with Vazquez?
No, his assistant came.
Is there any concept
you find particularly difficult?
No, it's fine.
Remember to say hello to Vazquez
when you see him.
Sure.
The meat is wonderful.
Thank you.
APPRENTICE WANTED
CLOCK SHOP
Carlos!
- You skipped class.
- It was rubbish.
Laura! Laura.
You left this on your desk.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Why bring it to class?
- My mother searches through everything.
Hey! I wanted it as a souvenir!
'L' HAS A DICK
Marta!
- Can I have a word?
- What about?
When you arrive somewhere
you say hello.
Please.
Remember the bag I left behind
and you returned to me?
Yes.
- Did you see what was inside?
- A box.
- Did you look inside the box?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- Why, what was it? Drugs?
Hey, I didn't look!
Before you took it,
was anyone else looking at it?
Is the interrogation over?
They're beautiful.
Hey, the other day I saw online
that the fine arts tests are in June.
Yes, but it isn't so easy.
You have to go to an academy
and be well-prepared.
Well, why not go to the academy
and get prepared?
And if you're accepted,
then you can decide.
Have you had your period yet?
Not yet.
Don't worry. Two more days.
Don't joke.
Well,
- we'd save on condoms, wouldn't we?
- Don't joke about it.
And what about this?
What are you doing?
Get off!
Stop it! No!
- I'll get it.
- Hello.
- Hi, there.
- Hello.
Sweetheart!
- Hello, love.
- Hello! I'm Eloisa.
- Hello.
- Hello, this is √Ångel.
- You look lovely.
- Thank you.
What have you done to your hair?
You look great.
- I have to cut it.
- No way.
Don't mention my hair
or my job interview.
I can help you with that.
I'm a hairdresser now!
No, seriously, I know of a job
that might interest you.
We'll talk about that later.
Wow, the house is lovely!
It still needs a few touches...
Some pictures on the walls...
It looks great.
Happy birthday, love.
- How is she doing?
- Ask her.
Here's your gift, love.
- Can I exchange it?
- The gift receipt is in the bag.
You've changed so much.
You're all grown up.
- Well, where's the famous boyfriend?
- That's enough.
- He's a friend.
- Yes, sorry.
The friend. Where is he?
- Dad, don't say anything.
- I won't.
- Hello.
- Hello.
It's the friend!
I'm the father-in-law.
- I mean, the father.
- Don't listen to him.
- I'll take those.
- No, they're not for you.
- Are you Merche?
- Yes, her mother.
- Hello. A pleasure.
- I'm Carlos.
- Here, for you, for the new house.
- Liliums, my favorite.
You know how to win over
the mother-in-law.
I like him, Laura. He's polite.
You could learn from him.
I'm Eloisa, her stepmother.
- But a good one, a very good one.
- Nice to meet you.
If they were for the mother-in-law,
what do you have for my daughter?
- Dad!
- Thinking about the dowry?
Well, life's tough these days.
Thank you.
- How far along are you?
- I'm due in three months. Thanks.
- Do you mind if I touch it?
- No, go ahead.
Are you two thinking about it?
We want to, but Pablo travels a lot.
It's easy
with the women in this family.
If you sneeze at them
they get pregnant.
- Dad!
- Oh, please!
Well, is anyone missing?
- Yes, my cousin.
- Anita? Good!
Here.
But you already gave me a present.
Carlos!
I love it.
- Wow, it's like an engagement ring.
- It's lovely.
- You've got good taste.
- Thank you.
I'll get it.
- Anita!
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Great!
Where's the birthday girl?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
What a beautiful place.
- It's lovely.
- Let me see.
It's an amazing place.
With all the vegetation and palm trees
it's like an African jungle.
I've heard of that place,
it's like a tropical ecosystem.
It's amazing that it's in Spain.
- Less than 60 miles away.
- Right.
- More wine?
- Yes, please.
- Can you camp there?
- They look the other way.
I don't know
why we're talking about it.
Carlos, you should help me.
School is more difficult now.
You can't meet up during the week
and then talk on the phone
until all hours.
- Have you nothing to say?
- Me?
You're doing very well.
I agree with everything.
Laura?
Marta?
The teacher was worried.
He sent me to check on you.
Are you okay?
Christ!
Look at it, please.
I can't look.
Neither can I.
What will you do if you are?
Have an abortion, right?
- No, I'll have it.
- What?
Are you stupid?
Look at it, please.
But, Laura,
your father will kill you.
- They're divorced, he doesn't care.
- And your mother?
She'll be annoyed,
but she had me at 17.
You'll be cleaning up baby shit
and missing college.
Do you want to spend
another four years studying?
Fuck, Laura, you'll get a belly,
you'll be like a cow.
You'll be the fucking joke
of the school.
What do I care?
I'll have it in the village,
like my mother did.
It's nice there.
On your own?
No, Carlos would come
and I bet my mother would too.
Her marriage is shit,
she hasn't got a job.
Two lines mean I am.
One.
It's just as well, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Come on.
Don't keep thinking about it.
Some of us are meeting
at my house on Saturday.
I'll send you the address
if you feel like coming.
- A pajama party?
- It sounds silly, but it'll be fun.
You're an artist.
I knew you'd like it.
There's a guy in the street
staring at us.
No, on the other sidewalk.
- Who was it?
- My boyfriend from the village.
Well, my ex.
He called and said he wanted to see me.
I told him I was with you.
But he kept insisting,
so I saw him earlier.
The thing is, we'd taken some time out
but we never split up.
And then I met you.
Then he isn't your ex.
He is.
What's his name?
Juan.
And when did you take time out?
When you came here?
No, two months before.
So you've been cheating on him
with me.
Technically, yes.
If he hadn't appeared,
would you have told me?
Yes, I would.
Carlos, I'd have told you
but you were showing me the masks.
It's all right, really.
I'll tell you everything
about my life, my boyfriends.
I want to go home.
Carlos, please. It's Saturday.
Look, it threw me.
I just have to take it in.
I'll text you later.
Carlos, please.
I'm coming, I'm coming!
Hello, love. How are you?
I was talking to your mother.
I took a course I want her to do.
As a market trader.
Know what that is?
You can earn a lot...
Laura!
Laura, love!
She's a slut.
She's a fucking slut.
But you never liked Pablo.
And him?
He's going to be a father
and he sleeps with a slut?
God knows what he's given that baby.
Maybe they'll get back together.
I'd slit my wrists first, I swear.
I don't think it's such a big deal.
Really, I don't understand you.
I hate lies.
Why that expression?
I didn't lie to you.
What if I had been pregnant?
Why bring that up?
- What would you have done?
- We're not talking about that.
What would you have done?
I don't know. I don't know.
I'm 18 and you're 17.
Thanks for coming,
but I'd rather be alone.
He started touching my legs
to take the ants off
and he pulled my skirt up.
I was hysterical
because I hate ants.
And he knew that.
He was making it all up.
In fact, he took a photo
and said if I didn't undress
he'd post it online
and my parents would see it.
Fuck, that's lousy.
- How long ago was that?
- I was 14.
The worst thing is that now,
when I want to come,
- I think about him.
- No way!
- Yes.
- Fuck.
- I've never come.
- No?
You've never had an orgasm?
No.
- Have you tried with an older guy?
- No, that's disgusting!
Don't be silly.
If you haven't screwed
a 40-year-old, you haven't screwed.
Your turn, Lola.
What will I tell you?
Tell us about
the first time you came.
No, something heavier.
Go on.
This summer, in a bar,
I met an old boyfriend,
and I went with him
to see if he'd improved.
We were in bed, kissing
and remembering the old days,
and suddenly he said
he'd do it from behind.
Wait.
Behind, like a dog,
or behind-behind?
- Behind-behind.
- No!
He started putting it in...
and at first, it was hurting a bit.
That's normal.
But suddenly
I started liking it, a lot,
and I came.
I came like a pig!
No! And what's it like?
It's like shitting inside.
You're filthy!
Just turn it off.
Your turn.
Tell us something.
I can't think of anything.
- Come on.
- I can think of something.
What?
The parcel.
You swore you didn't open it!
What?
The parcel of rolled toilet paper.
Oh, that nonsense!
What?
I did a pregnancy test.
- Are you pregnant?
- No.
She didn't want an abortion.
- Seriously?
- Yes.
Well, tell us something kinky.
Yeah, filthy.
Have you never done anything very...?
In the village, don't you screw cows
and things for fun?
Sure, since we don't have TV
or the Internet we have to do something.
You have to tell us something real.
Come on, tell us something.
Come on, tell us.
Something heavy.
I did something
you couldn't imagine.
I've done everything.
Not this.
Laura... are you awake?
Yes.
Are you okay?
Yes.
I'm sorry that you're worried.
I'd like to be able to love
the way you can.
Have you never been in love?
Yes,
but I always end up
suffering too much.
You're beautiful.
We're going to have fun.
Let's go to sleep.
Hello.
I left a message on the phone.
I was with Marta, from school,
and two other girls.
You want to live your life?
Then you can pay for it.
Tomorrow you start looking
for a weekend job.
Is that what you care about?
Have you nothing to tell me?
To tell you?
Absolutely nothing.
Leave the phone there.
I pay for it.
- You want the phone?
- Yes, I want the phone.
Okay.
Take the fucking phone!
What about the fraud case?
- Was it true?
- I don't doubt it. It's fraud.
First, he makes
an inter-community acquisition
in which there is a tax
on consumer spending
that is also deducted.
When the merchandise
enters the interior market,
it has the output tax which gives
the buyer the right to deduct it,
but then he pays it...
Babe, are you okay?
Why haven't you texted?
Carlos, this is Merche.
- This is no time to call.
- I have to speak to Laura.
You can speak tomorrow.
Please, don't call again at this time.
Forgive me.
You forgive me.
If you'd been pregnant,
we would have had it, I swear.
Excuse me.
If you don't want an apprentice,
remove the sign. It can mislead people.
No one has ever come in
to ask about that sign.
How do I know you won't steal from me?
What?
How do I know you're not a thief?
I'm not going to steal.
I can even leave you my ID.
That's no use to me.
Look.
I can leave this watch as collateral.
It's a pretty good one.
My father gave it to me.
Unpaid?
Monday to Friday,
9:00 to 2:00 and 4:00 to 8:00.
All right, come tomorrow at 9:00.
I couldn't do it,
old guys don't turn me on.
Not even Matt Damon?
I don't know.
I've never been with a 40-year-old.
There's one I would do it with.
With her stepfather.
My stepfather?
You don't even know him!
I saw him on Facebook!
- You slut!
- I want to see him.
All right. I've got a couple.
Erase that photo!
What was that?
- Show me the photo.
- All right.
You barely inhaled. Take a drag.
- You go all out!
- What style!
The problem with getting pregnant
is that you're stuck with the father
the rest of your life.
I'd like to be connected
to Carlos forever.
- But he's gay.
- Don't say that!
Fuck!
Talk to him. He might need help
to come out of the closet.
He isn't gay.
- Stop that.
- Well, he isn't exactly normal.
I would know.
I like Carlos.
Maybe he's bisexual.
- It's possible.
- Maybe he's into everything.
Aren't you coming to bed?
No, I'm not sleepy.
- Is anything wrong?
- No. I'm going to finish this.
I'll wait for you in bed.
What are you studying?
Math.
I was terrible at that.
I wanted to ask you a question.
Go ahead.
Look, I don't mind
and I won't get angry.
I know that the day we moved...
you slept with Carlos
in your aunt's bed.
That's normal.
The bed is bigger
and you're at that age.
It's okay.
On Saturday,
did you use our bedroom?
It's all right,
I won't be angry.
No.
Laura, I don't mind,
and I won't tell your mother.
I was out all evening
and I slept at a friend's house.
Why?
A friend's house?
That's why she's so angry.
Yeah, well.
- What will you do?
- I don't know.
- I'd like you to explain.
- What's wrong?
You don't want a boyfriend
who just repairs watches?
Look, you can repair watches
or do whatever you want.
But you've got a lot of talent.
What do you know?
What qualifies you to say I have talent?
You could pass the tests.
What do you get
from working on watches?
I like it.
And I have time to think.
I have to go.
See you tomorrow, okay?
So long.
Are you all right?
I'm sorry about Pablo.
Pablo? He's going to Stuttgart.
To work?
I need you to do me a favor.
Pablo found...
part of a wrapper
from a condom
in our bedroom.
If he asks me again,
I'm going to tell him
that I've spoken to you
and that you and Carlos
used the bedroom
when we weren't here.
Okay?
Don't get all sanctimonious.
There's a party on Saturday night.
I'll be home late.
Carlos, sit down.
Your mother and I
want to talk to you.
Vazquez called.
We know you haven't been
in class for two weeks.
Did we put any pressure on you
to study law?
Did we say anything?
No.
We said it was a personal decision.
If you've started law,
you have to finish it.
I'd rather not do that.
- What?
- Not do what?
Is it your girlfriend?
No.
This isn't a joke.
We're talking about your future.
May I get up now?
Yes.
The cardboard, Laura.
It doesn't stop.
- What is it?
- The lift.
You know no one comes here.
Someone's there.
I'm about to come.
Laura, someone's there.
That's impossible.
Yes there is! Fuck!
- What's wrong?
- I can't take it anymore.
We have to keep hiding like dogs.
It's shit.
We have to do something.
Get dressed, go on.
Let's run away.
Let's go and live together.
- What are you talking about?
- Running away.
Far from this fucking city.
Right now, just the way we are.
I don't believe you!
- Seriously?
- Absolutely.
Look, I could work in a factory,
or in the country.
Would you like to?
We could go to my village.
Let's go!
It's the answer to all our problems.
We'd be away from our parents,
we could do what we wanted
- without explaining ourselves.
- We'd have our own house.
- We'd make love when we wanted.
- And be free!
You'll love the village.
You can paint in peace.
We can't go there.
It's the first place they'd look.
You'll miss this term
but then you can make it up.
Then you can study
or do what you want.
I don't want to study.
I'll be working,
so I can take care of you.
We could go to Medina del Campo.
I'd get work there.
- I've got a friend there.
- Fuck, that's perfect!
We'll have a sound system
and play music as loud as we like.
That'll have to wait a while,
but we'll get it.
Run!
Wait!
- My green sweater is in your house.
- Forget it.
But we're here.
Let's go now, come on.
Or we'll never go.
I'll just get my sweater.
We'll buy another one. Please.
We'll take the first bus.
It'll just take a minute.
Please.
Don't be silly.
Hello, love!
- Hello, Carmen.
- Is Carlos with you?
Yes, but I just wanted
to get my sweater.
No, come in.
Would you like some torrijas?
I love torrijas. But we can't.
Come on! Keep me company
for a while, I'm so bored.
- Charo wasn't able to come today.
- I don't know.
- Come on.
- I'll see what Carlos says.
Carlos loves torrijas.
Leave it to me, I'll persuade him.
- I don't know.
- Come on, come in.
I put the sweater in his closet.
Use the slippers, love.
I just waxed the floor.
And you can stay out
as late as you want?
Yes.
I promised I'd go to the party.
- Hey, can I ask you a question?
- Of course.
Have you ever thought
you might like boys?
I don't know. Even just a bit?
That you're bisexual?
What's this about?
Some very cool people are bisexual,
like Lady Gaga or Angelina Jolie.
What are you trying to say?
There are people who think
that what we did on my birthday...
I don't know.
You should know.
And I do.
Come on, we'll stay a while
and then we'll leave.
What people?
What do you mean?
Before you said,
"There are people who think..."
Did you tell anyone?
- I don't understand.
- Did you tell anyone what we did?
- It's a figure of speech.
- Wait.
Come on, just for a while.
Hey!
- This is girls' night.
- Don't be like that.
Let's go to the bathroom.
Hey, hang on, okay?
I'll be right back.
Go get a drink.
It stops you from feeling dizzy,
stops headaches.
You can take anything,
your folks won't know.
- What is it?
- What does it matter?
The thing is it works.
Give me 20 and you'll see.
Don't give him anything.
I don't trust him.
Look, I take them from my brother.
He gets them
for after his chemotherapy.
They leave you feeling like new.
What are you looking at?
- Sorry.
- You want to make out?
- Or do you want a pill? 20.
- No, thanks.
Fuck, what are you doing?
Calm down, we'll be out now.
Three of us have to piss.
What a pain.
You're making a mess of that.
Let me do it.
I told Alex that Susana fancies him
and wants to screw him.
She'll kill you.
I had to do something about them.
They're both useless.
- You're crazy.
- What are you doing?
- I'm wetting myself!
- Take it easy!
Mega-pain!
- What do you think?
- Wait a minute.
- I'm going to get Carlos.
- No, wait, wait.
- We'll tell Susana about Alex.
- He's been waiting for ages.
Don't feel guilty. Come on!
Tell Alex what you like.
Explain in detail.
Tell him how you want him
to undress you, to suck your tits,
- how to eat your...
- Lola, you're a brute.
I want him to be my boyfriend.
All right, to love!
To love!
Another one.
- Not for me.
- What's up?
- Where are you going?
- I'll see you later.
Laura!
Where are you going?
- Have you seen my boyfriend?
- No,
but if I were him,
I wouldn't leave you on your own.
When will you give me a chance?
I'd never get involved with you.
I don't want to get involved,
I want to be with you.
- I'm back now.
- I'm leaving.
Don't. We'll have fun
and then go where you want.
Who did you tell
about what we did?
- What do you mean?
- Fuck you!
Carlos, please.
- Laura, you're here!
- Hi, Alex.
- This is Carlos, my boyfriend.
- Hi.
Alex, a classmate.
- Want to get some drinks?
- All right.
Where are you going?
- Carlos!
- Swear that you told no one!
- What's wrong with you?
- Swear.
I swear.
Go back to your friends.
What's wrong?
I'd like you to be happy.
I'm happy with you.
We need time.
I don't know who I am.
Or who you are.
Maybe I'm losing my mind.
Is it full?
One of the disadvantages of being a girl.
- I'll see you later.
- Hey...
which painters do you like?
Why?
You paint, don't you?
Well, I really like Boccioni.
The Italian futurist.
- You know him?
- Of course.
They say he was killed falling off
a horse, but I think it was suicide.
My turn.
There's a room full of paintings
with people who seem to look at you
as if you'd killed someone.
Behind it is the secret door
into the bedrooms.
That's cool.
I really like you.
I think I may be falling in love.
I'm in love with my boyfriend.
Your ex-boyfriend, you mean,
because he's left you.
No, we've taken time out to think.
To think what? That's stupid.
I don't need to think. I'm not...
What have you done?
Fuck...
- Wait.
- No, leave it.
- It's nothing.
- What happened?
The fucking glass.
Don't ruin your scarf.
It's nothing.
I'll go to the washroom.
Don't ruin your scarf, Laura.
It's just blood.
Stay here. Don't worry.
Where are you going?
- Look, I'm okay.
- You're not. Where are you going?
I'm okay, Laura.
You can't ride the bike like this.
You're drunk.
- I'm okay, Laura.
- No, you're not okay.
Look at yourself, you're not okay.
- Let Alex take you.
- Yes, Alex can take you.
Sure, I don't mind.
I wanted to take you home.
Do it for me, please.
All right? Please.
Seriously.
- Alex, can you take him home?
- Have you got a helmet?
- Alex, are you fit to drive?
- Yeah, I'm great.
The keys.
You're stoned out of your mind.
And I didn't make out once!
- What does that say?
- You're filthy!
We haven't had enough to drink.
I usually put the whole thing.
- Can we go now?
- Yes, let's go.
- And when will I see you?
- I don't know.
I'm here every Saturday.
Shit, the bus!
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.
- Hi, there! How are you?
- Hello.
- Were you at Stusy?
- No, at Spook.
- The '82 party.
- Cool.
- Who was the DJ?
- Someone from Amsterdam.
What was the music?
Techno.
- Do you like techno?
- Not much.
It's not your style.
Do you mind sitting in the back?
- What was it like?
- Pretty good. It's cool.
- Where have you been?
- It's near La Central.
- It's a cool place, it was packed.
- Yeah?
How come you left so early?
I don't know.
I got a bit fed up in the end.
What's wrong?
Are you okay?
You seem strange.
You'll never want
to be with me again.
That isn't the question.
We've taken time out to think.
I'm going to date someone.
You're joking.
No, I'm not.
Who?
El Moro.
You are joking!
He isn't like you think.
He's in love with me.
Are you serious?
- Yes.
- With El Moro?
But he screws everything!
Can you keep your voice down?
If I date him
you'll never come back to me.
It's only been two weeks.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
- What about me?
- You left me!
Just so we could sort things out.
- That isn't possible now.
- Don't say that.
It is. I love you.
- We're very different.
- Complementary.
- Don't you love me?
- Yes.
Well, then?
I don't know. I need to try.
And then I'll know what I really want.
I need to try.
Are you okay?
A bit dizzy.
We'll talk tomorrow.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
I've been thinking
and it's best
if you go out with that guy.
So you can appreciate what we have
and know what I'm worth.
Thanks, I have to go.
And I wanted to say
that you won't lose me.
- I will lose you.
- No.
- You'll never forgive me.
- No.
When are you seeing him?
- Let me go.
- Tell me.
Are you going to bed with him?
Don't do this.
Tell me. Tell me, please.
Tell me.
We're not children.
I know you're going to do it.
- Tell me.
- I don't know.
When are you seeing him?
What does it matter?
Exactly. If it doesn't matter...
I don't know, I don't know.
- Tell me, please.
- Friday!
All right. Wait a minute.
Call me afterwards.
- No, Carlos.
- Please, promise me.
- Call me when you come back.
- Okay.
FRIDAY, APRIL 29
You're fired.
- What?
- You're fired.
You gave me the morning off.
Your father told me
you're studying law.
So go back to your studies.
It's your duty.
Wait.
Here.
You'll thank me for it.
Go and get dressed.
Grandma died.
I don't feel well.
I'm going to the cafe.
I have some ibuprofen.
- Thanks.
- Don't take too long.
Do you have some money?
Grandma is in room 7.
Hurry back.
AVAILABLE
OCCUPIED
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for Laura.
I thought she was with you.
No, she's with another guy.
I understand.
I want to go away with her
for a few days.
- You love her very much, don't you?
- Yes.
I think we just need some time.
- If we're alone, we can sort it out.
- What you need
is to give each other space.
Laura is too young for such
a serious relationship, and so are you.
You still have a lot of living to do.
We love each other.
There she is.
If she wants to go away with you
for a few days, I don't mind.
You're late.
We agreed I'd call you.
What were you saying to my mother?
Did you do it?
I didn't even see him.
What's this about?
Are you seeing him tomorrow?
This was a bad idea.
Don't do it, please.
Let's go to the place
with the palm trees.
We could go tomorrow morning.
Don't wait for me tomorrow.
I won't phone you,
and I won't answer my phone.
Don't do it, please!
What's so funny?
- Are you sure I can go in there?
- Of course you can.
- Isn't it neat?
- It really is.
And this is
the Chamber of Deputies,
with representatives
of the main royal towns.
And the clergy here are the scariest.
- They terrify me.
- My God!
- Look at their faces!
- You see?
They're looking at us.
And here's the secret door
I told you about.
This leads to the bedrooms.
Wow!
- Did he really sleep here?
- And he brought his mistresses.
The fucking kings are something else.
Come here.
Lie down.
It's an amazing sensation.
I don't think I dare.
Are you scared?
- What if it breaks?
- Don't be silly.
Look. You see?
El Moro is a bastard.
But don't worry,
he dumps them really fast.
Forget about girlfriends.
With a good jerk-off...
Dickhead!
Pass me the joint.
- It's passed, you don't ask for it.
- That's rubbish.
Listen, it's too bad about El Moro
because he really puts on a show.
He never fails.
He takes them on a night tour
of the parliament building,
a private one!
And he screws them on the king's bed.
No way.
Didn't you know?
In the parliament building?
Yes.
A royal screw!
Nobody believes that.
He works weekends
and studies weekdays.
Since he's a security guard,
he gives them a guided tour,
he shows them the paintings,
all of that...
and then he screws them.
The first time is always there.
He says they go crazy for it.
Don't laugh, he did your sister.
- That's a lie.
- You know it isn't.
- It is a fucking lie.
- Do you need to see the used condom?
Where are you going, dickhead?
Hey, where are you going?
You can't go in there!
It's an emergency, I have to speak
to El Moro. He works here.
There's no one here with that name.
Well, it's a nickname.
His name is...
Garcia.
Or Garces. Garces.
- What do you want?
- I have to speak to him.
He's doing his rounds.
Can you call him?
- If he's your friend, you call him.
- My battery's flat.
Yeah, and you're drunk.
- Can you call him?
- He'll be back soon.
Please call him from that gadget.
- It's for emergencies.
- This is an emergency!
- What's the emergency?
- He's fucking my girlfriend!
- Calm down, calm down.
- Laura! Laura!
- Move!
- Motherfuckers!
Get the hell out of here!
- Kid, you've better get out of here.
- Scram.
Moro.
- Moro.
- Sorry.
What is it?
We had a jealous boyfriend here
looking for you.
Yeah, very funny.
Don't be a smartass,
listen to the shouting outside.
What are you talking about, moron?
Laura!
Laura!
Laura!
Laura!
Laura!
Do you want to go to him?
Laura, please!
Bitch!
Laura!
Bitch!
Bitch...
Emergency services.
There's a bomb
in the parliament building.
Under the king's bed.
- It'll explode in 15 minutes.
- Please tell me your name and ID.
She's so beautiful.
Yes, she is.
I was at the hospital seeing my sister.
It all went well.
I'm going back to the village.
I've spoken to your father
so that you can stay if you want.
We'll find a college dorm.
Do you remember when I was seven?
I was very sick, I had a fever.
Dad had just left
and you were very angry.
You told me that I should never marry
until I was economically independent.
I don't know
if it was because of the fever
but I was really scared,
and I told you
that I couldn't live if you died.
Do you remember?
I don't know why on earth I said
"economically independent"
to a child of seven.
He hasn't come out for three weeks.
Maybe you can persuade him.
Carlos, my son,
look who's come to see you.
Help me persuade him
to apply for Fine Arts.
The tests are in June
and he'll have to get ready.
Please.
Hello, Carlos.
I know you don't want to see me but...
I needed to say goodbye properly.
I'm going to the village.
My mother is separated.
I wanted you to know
that you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.
And that I'm very sorry
that I hurt you.
How's El Moro?
That's over.
It was a mistake.
Know what?
My sister was born.
When I held her
I thought she was our daughter.
I love you.
I think I'll always love you.
Yeah.
It's true.
Until a good dick appears.
I think I did it
to try to forget you,
and so you'd forget me.
Did you fuck him?
Being with you
was the loveliest,
most romantic thing I've ever known,
and I regret telling the girls
about what we did.
Did you come?
No one has given me
as much pleasure as you.
You haven't answered me.
Look.
I did this
so you'll never forget our story.
I had to redo it lots of times.
Did you come?
Yes, I came.
Sex with you is wonderful.
And I want you to know
that my heart is yours
and it always will be,
and whenever you desire me
you'll have me.
Now.
What?
I want to have you now.
Show me that they're not just words.
You want to make love?
Call it what you want.
Carlos, you're not well now.
That's why.
Maybe it would help me.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Will you give me a kiss at least?
I'm on the pill.
I don't want to catch anything.
You're not like this.
- Don't let anyone say otherwise.
- Shut up.
Get on top.
I'll be back soon.
Faster.
I hope we realize
we can't live without each other,
and we can start over
from the beginning.
Stop.
Please,
don't forget me.
I'm sorry.
I am you.
I am you.
I am you.
I'd like to feel what you feel,
think what you think.
I am you.
I am you.
- You are me.
- You are me.
- I could feel inside you.
- There are moments,
- when I want to stop being me...
- I dreamed I was inside you.
- ...so I can be you.
- Recently...
Nothing about you disgusts me.
I want to suck
every part of your body.
I'd like to feel what you feel...
- I'd like to...
- Think what you think.
I'd like to feel what you feel,
think what you think.
I want to suck
every part of your body.
Nothing about you disgusts me.
- Recently...
- There are moments...
- ...I dreamed I was inside you.
- When I want to stop being me...
- I could feel inside you.
- So I can be you.
You are me.
I am you.
