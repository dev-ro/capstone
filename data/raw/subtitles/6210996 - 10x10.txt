Hey, guys, how's the mart going?
Here you go.
Thanks.
Thank you, guys.
Okay, be well.
- Cathy, how you doing, you good?
- Hey, good, how are you?
I'm good, uh, want the usual?
Um... yeah.
All right, take a seat,
I'll bring it over.
Okay, oh! I got these for Mia.
For... for my Mia?
Yeah.
Wow, uh, thank you.
How's she doing?
Yeah, I mean, we gotta run a few
more tests, but... but thanks.
Well, if you need any help
with the kids...
I won't forget this, Cathy.
Here you go... dinner special.
Thank you.
- Anything else?
- No, that's great, thank you.
You focus on your breath.
Come down to your mat
when you're ready.
And relax, put your head
to the side.
Now is a time to set
your intention...
for your time here...
whatever it is you'd like
to work on...
and focus in on that.
Big breaths, nice and deep.
And in your own time...
come to a standing position
at the front of your mats.
Cathy.
Cathy?
Now let's bring our arms up,
bring 'em to our heart's center.
Let's take beauty firmly
into our hearts today...
and find peace within
our practice.
Alondra, hi... is everything
all right for tonight?
From Warrior 1,
let's open out to Warrior 2...
keeping a soft gaze
over your fears...
opening up your chest and hips
to the side.
Great... oh, I'll let you know,
I don't... okay, bye.
It's not just the physical stuff
he's so good with...
it's the mind.
My husband, he's always away
on business...
and the other day, I felt these
handles here...
and I was like, oh god.
And Casey is just so gorgeous...
do you know if he does
house calls, at all?
If you know what I mean?
Yeah, I don't have his details,
I'm sorry...
but he's Casey Yoga online,
so you can find him there.
Great, thank you.
- Sorry.
- Jesus!
It'd be so nice to stay
in touch.
- Sure.
- I'm on Instagram, @jenniferraz.
And your Instagram?
Oh, I'm Cathy, cathy@flowers.
Great, well, I'll follow you.
- Okay, great.
- Take care.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Help!
You make another sound
and I'll kill you right here.
Fuck.
I want you to listen very
carefully.
These are four-foot-thick
concrete walls...
padded with sound absorbing
products.
I know this, because I put
them there myself.
I'm telling you this, because
there is no point screaming.
Nod if you understand me.
I'm gonna take the tape
off your face...
and I want you to tell me
your name.
Nod if you understand.
Help...
Help me.
Help me, please, somebody help me!
Oh...
Help me!
Help!
Help me!
Groundbreaking evidence...
suggests the victims
did not die...
from unnatural causes,
or intoxication.
Families of the victims
challenge the coroner's...
verdict and are campaigning
for the case to be reopened.
Oh, I see you found the vent.
I can leave, if you like.
You can keep on screaming and we
can see how long it takes...
someone to hear you, or we can
just get down to business.
Please don't touch me.
I have money, I have savings,
I have $50,000.
Mm, that's a lot of money...
for someone in your line
of business.
Take it.
I don't want your money.
Animals can smell death,
did you know that?
A news story recently documented
a bull...
waiting for the slaughterhouse.
Its entrance has ten-foot,
steel walls.
The end of its life just hanging
in the air all around it...
and you know what it did?
Like some kind of fucking animal
superhero...
it scaled the wall and ran away,
right across the city.
Of course, they caught it,
they killed it...
tried to eat it, but its meat
had turned to poison.
It was poisoned by fear.
They'll find my car.
It will lead them here to you.
I promise if you let me go
right now...
I won't say a word, I promise.
I want you to tell me your name.
Cathy... my name is Cathy
Noland.
Oh, my god.
Today the long-running case...
reached its conclusion.
Toxicology reports on the
exhumed bodies...
failed to prove an alternative
cause of death.
Family members devastated
by the news...
vow to keep fighting
this decision.
And in other news...
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Oh, shit... okay.
Come on.
Please?
Help me!
Somebody...
No... please don't kill me.
Please!
Okay, please don't kill me.
Okay... oh, shit...
Oh, fuck.
Fuck!
Oh... come on.
Somebody help me! Help me!
Please... help! Help me!
Somebody!
Where did you think
you were gonna go?
Stay back.
Stay the fuck back.
How do you know what I do?
You said... "that's a lot
for your line of work."
How do you know what I do?
Well, you can't make much
selling flowers.
You know, the food tastes
better hot.
Could be a nice way to get
to know each other.
You could tell me some of the
things I want to know.
Like your name, for a start?
My name is Cathy Noland.
Why don't we just start
this again?
I just want to know you
a little bit more.
Have there been others?
Who the fuck are you?
I'm the one with the gun...
and last time I checked, gun
beats knife, so just sit down.
Hm?
I guess you're trying to figure
me out, right?
I think you're smart.
You've worked out, if I wanted
to kill you...
I'd have done it by now.
Now I've only asked you one
thing since you got here today.
What is that?
My name.
You tell me your name and then
we can really start talking.
My name is Cathy Noland.
Alondra! What are you
doing here?
Remember, I called earlier
to see if you need me today?
You say you call back.
You didn't call, so I came.
Why all this mess?
I'm sorry, Alondra, I just
forgot to call you back.
I don't need you today.
No, no, no, leave it.
Is everything okay, Senor Lewis?
Everything's fine, thank you.
You're bleeding, Senor Lewis!
Alondra, please! It's just
one of those days, you know?
You should leave now.
Okay, I come tomorrow with
Summer, after the sleepover.
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING
Oh... no...
Let me fix you up.
Yes?
Learned that John Lampty...
had undergone a routine medical
check...
with his insurance providers.
Lampty's kidney disease
was unfound...
and he was given a clean
bill of health.
The coroner's report later
revealed kidney malfunction.
No charges, lack of evidence...
prevents a retrial
of Charleston Three.
Family members left the
courthouse...
in tears as the verdict was
read in the cases...
of three patients who died...
at the All Angels Hospital
in Charleston.
Are you ready to tell me
your name?
I've told you already.
Just tell me what
I want to know.
My name is Cathy.
Birthday?
February 15th.
Born where?
Orange County, California.
Where did you go to school?
Fair Ridge High, then NYU.
What did you study?
- English.
- And after?
I worked in a library for a few
years...
and then I came to Atlanta
and I opened my business.
In the church?
- Hm?
- Were you raised in the church?
No.
Brothers or sisters?
No.
- Parents' profession?
- What is this?
Just answer the questions!
My parents are divorced,
my father's dead.
I didn't ask you that, I asked
you what they did?
My mother's a retired nurse...
my father, he worked for a
football team.
What did he do?
He was on the staff, not a
player, organizer or something.
I don't know, he travelled
a lot.
- Which team?
- What?
I said which team?
Detroit Lions.
So you were born
in California...
but your dad worked for the
Detroit Lions?
Like I said, he travelled a lot.
I've been watching you.
I've been watching you
for months.
I know for a fact, that you've
lied about almost every...
single question I've asked, so
why don't we start again, hm?
Where were you born?
California.
Again! Where?
Orange County, California.
- Try again!
- California!
The next one goes in your head.
Where were you born?
Green Bay, Wisconsin.
Where did you go to school?
Where did you go to school?
East Star High.
And you were raised in
the church, a good church girl?
I can't hear you.
And I just know it broke your
heart when Daddy left home.
- Who are you?
- Just stick to the questions.
It broke your heart.
Yes.
Mom was a nurse, your dad
was a team doctor.
Left Mommy for a cheerleader...
and that put your twin sister
at the end of a rope.
I heard how much you loved her.
We've all had people we loved.
But you're a survivor.
You went back to school and you
made something of yourself.
Why are you doing this?
But there was no
English, was there?
And there was no library job,
was there?
So what did you study?
- Answer me!
- Medicine.
What exactly did you study?
Nursing.
So, why don't we talk about the
biggest piece of the puzzle...
the one thing I've wanted to
know since we got here today.
What is your name?
Cathy, my name is Cathy.
No, it's not.
My name is Cathy.
Cathy was the name
of your dead sister.
Come on!
Natalie.
My name is Natalie-Ann Stevens.
I guess you're wondering
why I have you here.
But you know what... Natalie?
I think you already know.
Oh, no...
Oh...
Oh, come on.
And finally, she sleeps.
The world's most beautiful,
little girl.
Come on.
9-1-1, what's...
Hello? Police? Can you hear me?
Can you hear me, police? Hello?
Ssh.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
My name is Cathy, I'm being
held hostage.
Can you trace this cell? Hello?
I was thrown in the trunk
of a car, a Dodge, I think.
Hello, can you hear me?
Where is it?
Where's the fucking phone?
No.
You wanna get this over with?
All right, you worked in a
hospital, Nurse Stevens.
Where did you work?
Saint Mary's Green Bay.
And after?
All Angels, Charleston.
And how many of those patients
died inexplicably in your care?
Which one?
You mean which one of the
Charleston 3 was my wife?
Number 3, Alana Matthews-Lewis.
Remember her?
That's why you moved away,
wasn't it?
Three people die unaccountably,
people were curious.
The duty nurses were questioned.
This was four years ago,
there was a trial.
All the nurses were acquitted,
we were innocent.
So why'd you leave?
I needed a fresh start, this
trial, it ruined my life.
And what about those three
people...
do they get a fresh start?
What about my wife?
You see, first I-I bought
into it...
and then a few things started
to not make sense...
like my wife's missing wedding
ring, she never took it off.
And then there was John Lampty,
he died of organ failure.
But a month earlier, he passed
his medical insurance.
Mr. Lampty, he died of an
undiagnosed kidney disease.
Alana was drunk.
Only I know my wife didn't
drink that much.
And her blood was full of GHB,
a rape drug!
Alana's blood was flooded
with that drug!
The court found no negligence
with the hospital.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Are you?
You're not here because I think
you killed my wife.
You're here because I know you
killed my wife...
and I want to know why.
And if I don't get a good enough
explanation, Natalie...
as to why my wife died,
then you will die.
So, Summer is four today.
She was so excited, that she
was awake at 5:00 AM...
weren't you?
This is her beautiful mom
Alana...
and she is tired, because she
stayed up to watch the game.
So tired.
Come on, let's have a picture.
Say hello to the family.
- Hey.
- Hello.
She's four,
she's getting old...
and she stays up all night.
Uh-huh, like Mommy, because
Mommy sleeps all night long.
Oh, it's because I...
Let's show Daddy, yeah!
We got you!
It's very cold and we're
freezing and it's snowing...
and Summer's hat's fallen off.
Zip it hard.
Yeah!
Happy Thanksgiving,
Mom and Dad, we love you.
Happy Thanksgiving, in-laws.
Wave to the camera!
Say "bring presents"!
- We miss you!
- Lots and lots of presents!
See you soon.
No, please! Please, I'll tell
you!
I'll tell you everything.
Please.
You were right, we were raised
in the church, my sister and I.
We learnt the ways of the Bible,
we had God in our hearts...
we were happy, we were loved.
We were protected by God.
But, you see, not by the man
who should have.
My father, he ran around
for months...
with my sisters' best friend.
Lies upon lies, my mother,
she found out.
Finally had the courage to
confront him about it.
Then the coward, he just packed
his bags and he left.
He abandoned us, just left us
with all his shame.
The town, they stopped talking
to us...
stopped looking us in the eye,
like we were invisible.
What does this got to do
with my wife?
Every Sunday, we would
just sit there.
We would just listen
to the church bells...
calling everybody to service
and we just held hands...
and we lost everything.
We had done nothing wrong...
we were good people...
and we were being punished
for my father's sins.
And my sister, my poor,
baby sister...
I found her in the barn...
hanging from the rafters.
I dedicated my life to her...
to serving people, and these
patients in the hospital...
they would talk to me,
they would confide in me.
They would tell me their
secrets...
things that they had done...
bad things.
Did you know John Lampty
had two wives?
You remember Jane Spencer?
She threw herself off a second
floor balcony after calling...
the cops saying that her husband
was beating the shit out of her?
It was all lies, he hadn't laid
a finger on her.
He was arrested, charged
with attempted murder.
She told me everything
after I caught her...
splitting her stitches
on her face...
making her wounds look worse.
She was just trying to shake him
down for divorce money.
That man, he loved her.
My wife loved me.
Your wife...
Your wife, she wasn't wearing
her wedding ring...
because she was spreading her
legs for another man.
You're lying.
She was on her hands and knees
panting like a fucking dog.
Don't you say another word.
Come on, she was dressed to the
nines, drunk in a hotel bar.
Not a single piece of ID was
found on her when she collapsed.
Do you really believe that
she was at a work meeting?
I saw him, the guy, he came
to visit her in secret...
in the hospital, big guy,
tall guy, handsome guy.
Shut up.
He told me that they were doing
it all the time.
That they couldn't help
themselves.
See the Bible says that we
should hold marriage with honor.
Your wife was a sinner,
your wife was a whore!
Don't you say another word!
She was a sinner...
so you tell me,
who's in the wrong?
You, Natalie, or your wife?
I did it.
I need to hear you say it.
I killed her.
And now you know why.
Stop... you're an idiot.
What? What do you want
me to say?
My name is Alana...
You're an idiot.
What? What do you want
me to say?
Agh!
Enjoying the view, sir?
I used to come here
with my wife.
Is your hand okay?
Didn't even see that. I was just
doing some DIY at home.
And where's home?
Just across the ridge,
about three miles away.
Do you have your license
with you, sir?
- Is there a problem?
- License, please.
Sure.
Everything okay, officer?
Just investigating a call...
a car matching yours
was described.
Your car's very clean,
Mr. Lewis.
Is it?
He good.
Mind if I take a look
in the trunk?
Sure.
This yours?
They're my wife's.
Sorry to have troubled you, sir.
Not a problem.
What do I say to my daughter...
when she asks what happened
to her mom?
You had no right to take
my wife from me...
before I had a chance
to talk to her.
You have to turn yourself in.
I think that's gonna
be a problem.
Why'd you have to ruin
everything?
My name is Cathy!
Now you think I'm gonna
give my life up for you?
I'm Cathy now, I'm happy...
and you expect me to give
it all up, for you?
Where's the gun?!
No!
She's sick, she get better.
- Daddy, there's no sleepover.
- Senor Lewis...
No!
Alondra!
Alondra?
Please, Alondra!
Don't move!
- Please don't hurt her!
- Stay the fuck back!
- Daddy!
- Summer!
You stay very still, Summer.
Do exactly as the lady says,
okay?
Why did you make things
so complicated?
Everything was so simple...
and now this.
Please, she's done nothing
wrong.
No, she hasn't, neither did you.
Neither did I.
Natalie, listen to...
My name... my name is Cathy.
She's a kid.
All this... all this here right
now, this is all on you.
Daddy?
Please, I'm begging you,
don't hurt my child.
Your child? You think this
is your child?
You were betrayed, Robert.
Cathy, listen to me, you don't
have to turn yourself in.
I won't say anything to anyone.
I don't believe you.
You can go back to your life,
just as it was.
I can't, I called the cops,
they'll trace the cell.
They'll be here, I mean, what am
I supposed to say to them?
This is gonna end one way,
I'm so sorry.
Except for one thing.
This house is recording
everything.
What?
They're gonna hear everything
you just said.
You're lying.
- Agh!
- Summer, run, run!
Summer! Summer!
Baby?
Summer? Baby?
Oh, come on, let's get
out of here.
You stay there.
Come on.
Daddy... she's gone.
Come on!
Quickly... close the door.
You stay here.
Fuck!
Baby... come here.
