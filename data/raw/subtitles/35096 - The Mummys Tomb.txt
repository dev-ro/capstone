Most of these incidents
are so incredible...
that one would almost have to be
there in order to believe them.
You know, many people believe
that we archaeologists...
are just a collection
of old fogies...
digging around in ruins
after old dried-up
skulls and bones.
Particularly medical men like
yourself. Isn't that so, John?
I wouldn't say that, Dad.
Not everybody thinks that way.
I could go on
telling stories
like this all day long.
Personally, I think
you're boring Isobel
and her mother.
Who cares
what happened
3,000 years ago?
Being my sister doesn't give you
the right to be disrespectful.
I'll have you...
Now, now.
Are you two children
starting that feud again?
I just get annoyed.
So does everybody else.
Am I boring you,
Mrs. Evans?
Not at all. I find it
most interesting.
And you, Isobel?
Oh, I should say not.
Please tell us the rest.
All right.
Well, we started out from Cairo
to search for Ananka's tomb.
We weren't a particularly
adventuresome-looking group.
There was Babe Hanson,
an old friend of mine,
a Brooklyn magician
named Solvani...
and his daughter, Marta.
And, oh, yes, Dr. Petrie
of the Cairo Museum.
We traveled for a long time
through the desert,
then up into the mountains.
Babe! Babe,
where are you?
Wow!
What happened?
You all right?
I started to hook the wire
to the detonator to set off
the dynamite and here I am.
Effendi! Effendi!
This is an unholy tomb.
It's the seal of
the seven jackals.
What we've been
searching for.
They mustn't touch it.
There's a curse upon it.
Oh, bosh.
It means death to whoever
breaks that seal.
We can't stop for silly
native superstitions.
I've waited a long time
for this moment.
The native workers fled,
screaming something about there
being a curse on the place.
However, it didn't turn out
to be Ananka's tomb at all.
Easy.
It's heavy. Watch out.
That's good.
Look.
Oh.
Why, it isn't
sealed.
Let's take it off.
Careful, now. Careful.
That isn't Princess Ananka.
It's a man.
And in the finest state
of preservation of any
mummy I've ever seen.
Later on, we found the most
amazing thing about this mummy.
Doctor... what do these
lines in his face mean?
There's only one answer.
He was buried alive.
He must have
struggled desperately
against those bandages.
What a terrible way to die.
Probably for some sacrilege.
Possibly.
Have you touched his face?
What?
Go ahead. Touch it.
Feels like
living tissue.
Exactly.
How true that proved to be.
Because, astounding
as it may seem,
Kharis had never really died.
We learned afterward that
Kharis was being kept alive...
by a strange race
of high priests.
Only one of these
high priests remained,
a man by the name
of Andoheb.
He and a servant...
kept constant watch
on our movements from
up above in the mountains.
Very interesting,
aren't they, Dr. Petrie?
Professor Andoheb.
Wh-where did you
come from?
The important thing, Doctor,
is that I'm here.
Then you knew about this tomb,
and yet you insisted
the vase was an imitation.
There are some things
in science which should
be brought to light.
And there are others, Doctor,
which should be left alone.
You mean
we never should have
come into this cave?
Since you are here,
I think it's fitting...
that you should learn
exactly what you've
stumbled upon.
Come.
As a scientist,
you are very unobserving,
Dr. Petrie.
Why, there's a pulse beat.
Why, this is absurd.
It's... it's fantastic.
In this vial
I have a fluid
from nine tana leaves.
Nine tana leaves,
Dr. Petrie.
That wouldn't mean
anything to you,
but watch.
Now, Dr. Petrie.
Why, it's...
it's beating faster.
He's alive.
Let me go!
Get off! Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go! Aah! Aah!
Let me go!
The mummy.
Somebody swiped it.
Who could've done that?
I can't understand it.
Steve! Petrie!
What could've happened?
I don't know, Babe.
He's dead.
Go on and get
some sleep, Marta.
We'll get a start
as soon as it's light.
Steve. I wish you'd
give all this up...
yes?
And come back
to the States with us.
I can't promise you that,
but I will be back sometime.
Do you mind if I say
I think you're a swell person?
Well, after that, things
happened pretty fast.
The next victim was
my native overseer, Ali.
The same fashion
as the doctor.
Marta went to bed
that night. We were
all pretty jittery and...
Marta!
Babe.
When we got there,
they'd disappeared.
Obviously, there was some
sort of secret passageway.
I remained
to search for it...
and Babe looked around
outside.
The mummy apparently had
broken an urn in passing.
I examined the fragments
and found a clue.
There was a secret passageway.
Steve!
Marta, what happened?
How did you get here?
The mummy brought me here.
He's alive.
Yes, I know.
Pop, is he
all right?
He's all right.
Just a little shaken up.
Meanwhile,
outside of the temple...
see here, you Egyptian
Mickey Finn.
I'll give you three
to tell me where she is.
We've gotta get you
outta here in a hurry.
He's after tana fluid.
That's what must be
in this vial.
And in the urn!
It's full of the fluid.
You mustn't let him
get it.
Keep him
away from it!
Stop him!
Stop him!
Well, I got Marta
back safely, all right.
Brought back the body of
the Princess Ananka too.
But I've always
regretted...
I wasn't able to bring back
the mummy with it.
You can well imagine what
a contribution to science
that would have been.
The monster was really alive,
walking and breathing?
Absolutely.
It's beyond
the imagination.
The most amazing thing
I've ever heard.
It's like hearing
from a world beyond.
That's the way it happened,
and if Marta were alive today...
she'd tell you
the same thing.
Nobody that ever went through
an experience like that
could ever forget it.
Well, at least
I have the satisfaction...
of having destroyed
a terrible monster,
and in doing so,
rid the world...
of an awful curse.
Thirty years ago, an infidel
sought to destroy me...
and to destroy Kharis.
Both attempts failed.
The bullet
he fired into me...
only crushed my arm.
The fire that sought
to consume Kharis...
only seared
and twisted and maimed.
Open it.
Kharis still lives...
Lives for the moment
he will carry death
and destruction...
to all those
who dared violate...
the tomb of Ananka.
That moment
has now arrived.
Once each night,
during the cycle
of the full moon,
you will dissolve
three tana leaves...
and give the liquid
to Kharis.
Three leaves
will keep him alive.
Nine leaves
will give him motivation.
And now I leave
in your hands...
the curse of Amon-Ra
and the destiny of Kharis.
Preparations are complete
to the last detail.
A position as caretaker
of the little cemetery
at Mapleton...
has been arranged.
Now swear by the sacred
gods of Egypt...
that you will
never rest...
until the last remaining member
of the Banning family
is destroyed.
Until they all have
suffered the fate...
of those who dare
to defile the tomb...
of our royal dead.
Swear that you will never
betray your trust.
I swear by the mighty
power of Amon-Ra,
whose anger
can shatter the world,
and by the dread
horror of Set,
I shall never
forsake my trust...
as a high priest
of Karnak.
And now, o mighty gods
of Egypt,
may you find
in this young follower...
a successor
worthy in every respect...
to carry on
the sacred trust...
now delivered
into his hands.
And save him
from any temptation...
that might
destroy him...
as it nearly...
destroyed me.
The ways of my people
are strange to Western minds,
but it is my duty
to offer prayers each night...
so that the soul
of my dear one...
is not left alone to wander
lonely and forgotten...
through the spaces of time.
Certainly. Anything
we can do to, uh...
No, there is nothing.
It is simply that
not a single word...
may be uttered
in the presence of occidentals.
Very good, sir.
You can count on me.
I shall see that you're
not disturbed, sir.
Thank you.
We are on our way,
Kharis.
Now nothing shall stand
between us...
and the fulfillment
of our vows.
Nothing, Kharis,
nothing.
How do you do?
Good evening.
You the new caretaker?
Yes, effendi.
They wired me and said
you'd be here.
I expected
a much older man.
It's very peaceful here.
I think I like it.
But it's such
a lonely existence.
It seems strange to me
that a young fellow like you...
would want to tie himself down
to the job of a caretaker.
You see,
there is a difference
in our philosophies.
Here I continue close
to the one I admired
and loved in life.
Have it your own way.
I'm not complaining.
You understand what
you have to do here.
Yes, I understand
thoroughly.
All right.
I'll be getting along.
Good-bye.
Bye, effendi.
Three tana leaves
to keep him alive,
nine to give him movement.
Kharis.
Kharis.
Kharis.
The moon rides high
in the sky again, Kharis.
There is death
in the night air.
Your work begins.
What was that?
I don't know.
Let's go home.
I'm scared.
Vic. Vic.
What's the matter?
There's something outside.
I seen it go by the window.
Seen what?
I don't know,
but its shadow
crossed my face.
Ain't nothin' out there.
I seen it, I tell ya.
I'm gonna phone
the Sheriff right now.
Hello. Sheriff speaking.
What do you want?
A shadow?
You wake me up for that?
Go on back to bed.
You must be crazy.
Whoa! Whoa!
What's the matter with you?
Quiet down!
You're kind of cramped
for space, aren't you, son?
Yeah.
well...
here goes.
You know, that's
just perfect.
Even if you didn't
ask me,
as a checker player,
I'd say you're
a darn good doctor.
Three games in a row
ought to prove something.
Yeah.
Yeah, it proves
it's 11:00.
I'd better be
getting on home.
I'd better be
getting to bed.
You should've
been there
an hour ago.
That's what you get for
having an older sister.
Now, Stephen,
don't you start
talking about ages.
What's the matter
with them?
I'll run out and see.
You go to bed, Dad.
All right, son.
I'll be back soon, Isobel,
to take you home.
Good night, Jane.
Good night, dear.
Good night, Isobel.
Good night.
King! Silver!
Quiet, boys!
What's the trouble
with the dogs, Jim?
They don't bark like that
for nothing.
Something must have
frightened them mighty bad.
Kharis!
Why, that... that sounds
like Stephen. Oh!
Wait here.
He...
He's dead.
One is gone, Kharis,
one who dared dery
our ancient gods.
Three remain...
only three...
And then we can return to
the land that gave us birth.
This is just
a waste of time.
Those marks
left on his throat
were nothing but dust.
You're the coroner
and you should know.
Still, it might
lead to some clue.
It's worth checking on.
I've compared this with
specimens of clay and dirt
from all over this territory.
There's nothing like it around
here.
It's just another
Why would anyone
do such a thing?
You can't call it a fiend murder
and let it go at that.
I don't intend to.
We'll do everything
we can.
Just let us
handle it.
All right, Sheriff.
Go on.
Well, you see,
we were...
We were parked along
the west county pike and...
What time was that?
It must've been
before 11:00.
We were listening to
Jan Garber on the radio.
Then suddenly a shadow
passed over us.
What sort of shadow?
I don't know.
Just a shadow.
Didn't you see
what made it?
No. We didn't
look up right away.
When we did, it was gone.
All right,
you can go.
Yes, sir.
I'll send for you
if I need you.
Vic, you called me about
seeing the same shadow.
I seen it. It passed
right over my bed.
I seen somebody
pass by the window too.
What did he look like?
I don't know.
The moon was behind him.
He just kinda looked...
all black.
Anything else?
When we looked out,
whoever it was was gone.
Okay, Vic,
I'll see you later.
I've covered a lot
of murders,
but this is the first time
I ever had a shadow
for a suspect.
Might as well
let the reporters in.
Yeah? What are you
gonna tell them?
I don't know.
Maybe they can
give me a lead.
Oh, John, are you
still at this desk?
I've checked through every
person that ever contacted him.
I still can't find anyone
who would have reason to...
Look, John, you can't spend
the rest of your life...
doing detective work.
All right, Auntie.
You're the boss around here.
What would you
have me do?
Stop neglecting your practice.
Go down to your office and...
My dear, since
this thing's happened,
you've forgotten her
completely.
I guess you're right,
Auntie.
Of course I'm right.
You go on out there.
Spend the day with her.
It'll do you both
some good.
All right.
It's wonderful being
with you again, darling.
Auntjane told me
you'd called,
but since that night
I've had so much on my mind.
Oh, I understand, John.
O mighty gods of Egypt,
may you keep up
my strength...
to carry out the mission
entrusted to me.
Strength to resist
any temptation...
which may be thrown
across my path.
Strength to fulfill
the destiny of Kharis.
I was wondering
when he'd get here.
When does
the train arrive?
Around 11:00,
I think.
I'll run down and meet him.
You needn't wait up.
I certainly shall
wait up.
Babe was always
one of my favorites.
Suit yourself, Auntie.
Good night.
Good night, dear.
Now go, while the moon
is still high in the sky.
Death goes with you.
Am I glad
to see you, Babe.
I came as fast
as I could, John.
How's Jane?
Oh, fine, considering.
Come on, get in.
We can talk on the way home.
Very well.
That's everything
we know.
We haven't found
a motive or reason
or anything.
Not a clue
nor nothing?
No.
Oh, yes,
there was something,
but nothing came of it.
What was that?
A kind of grayish mark
on Dad's throat.
Must've been a powerful
hand that strangled him.
What did you say?
Kind of grayish mark
on dad's throat.
Clay or dust
or something.
Grayish mark.
A grayish mark.
Quiet, King.
Quiet, Silver.
Jim! Jim!
You are back, Kharis.
Now you can rest.
Rest until the moon is high again
in the sky.
Two are dead
and two remain.
It's no use. Hemelpaegia.
Take a look.
It's a form of paralysis
caused by severe shock.
Jim. Jim.
Don't you know me?
Can't you remember anything?
If there's any change,
will you please call me?
I will, John.
All right, Babe.
Hey, look who's here!
Hi, boys, how are you?
Hi, Lefty, Joe.
Hi, Peoples.
Well, Frank, don't tell me
they sent you out
on this assignment.
Had my choice of covering
the Russian front or this.
I picked this.
Look, John,
your father's told
this story over and over.
Sure.
When I was a kid.
He used to tell me
fairy tales too.
Yes, but this is different,
and you know it.
Thirty years ago, your
father and I met up with
this curse in Ananka's tomb.
It wasn't
imagination either.
We saw that curse
bring on death.
We thought we'd destroyed
the mummy in the fire.
Maybe it escaped,
or maybe there was another one.
Oh, Babe, it's ridiculous.
Even supposing you were right,
what would it be doing
around here?
Where would it hide?
If those high priests
could keep a man alive
for 3,000 years,
they certainly could
figure out the rest too.
Oh, Babe, listen...
the only clue we have are
the dust marks on dad's throat,
and now on the throats
of Auntjane and Jim.
It's not dust. It was mold
that came from a mummy.
Have it your way.
We can't go on
arguing all night.
John, will you
do me a favor?
Certainly.
Leave Mapleton.
Go far away, quickly.
Why would I do that?
Because you're next in line.
The curse on that tomb
extends to the blood relations
of all who entered it.
Then you're included.
Suppose I am.
I'm an old man.
You're...
Now, Babe, I've known you
ever since I could walk.
I'd do anything for you.
But I'm a doctor.
I can't believe
in a live mummy.
Where are you going?
I'm going to find someone
that will listen to me...
before it's too late
for all of us.
There was a gray mark
on the throats...
of every person killed
in this town.
I know that.
That mark wasn't mud or clay.
It was mold.
We'll look into it.
We appreciate your
coming in...
to tell us about it.
Don't you believe me?
Well, now,
you see...
yes, I know.
You're a doctor too,
likeJohn Banning.
A heart and lungs
couldn't last 3,000 years.
Go on, tell me.
I was about to say
those very words.
All right, don't believe me.
And don't do anything.
Wait 'til more murders
are committed.
Look, there are dozens
of reporters here...
from all the
metropolitan papers.
A number of them
are razzing Mapleton about
the revival of witchcraft.
I know that.
What would they say
if I told them...
a mummy, 3,000 years old,
was doing the killing?
They'd laugh us
out of office.
What will they say when they
find out I was right...
and that I tried
to tip you off?
Give me a beer,
will you?
Yes, sir.
Coming right up.
Excuse me.
Aren't you Babe Hanson?
That's right.
I'm Jake Lovell,
"New York Record."
How are you?
Suppose you're down here
because of all the trouble.
Maybe.
Too bad about Mr. Banning
and his sister, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Any idea what's behind
everything?
I know
what's behind it.
You know what?
Know all about it...
and nobody will
listen to me.
Look, friend.
If you're after a listener,
you don't need to look further.
What's this all about?
Well, it started
thirty years ago...
when Steve Banning and I
discovered Ananka's tomb.
What's that got
to do with it?
Everything to do with it.
That tomb was guarded
by a live mummy.
We saw it.
We fought it.
You think a mummy's been doing
all these murders around here?
I know it was
a mummy.
What a yarn.
It's gonna be a tough baby
to sell my editor.
Give me all the details.
Well, at that time
Steve and I were young men.
Steve was interested
in archaeology.
I know. I've heard that
laughingstock routine before.
What do you want me to do?
The whole town's afraid
of their own shadows.
I'm following up on it.
Good-bye.
Sheriff!
It's out again.
I just saw that shadow.
A shadow. What else
did you see?
I didn't wait
for anything more.
That's a great help.
You don't think I was
taking any chances?
Where did you see it?
Along High Street.
We're going back
to High Street.
I've written hundreds
of stories, but never...
The killer!
He's out again!
He just frightened Nick Landsford
down on High Street.
The Sheriff s
down there now!
Thanks, Babe.
See you later.
Kharis!
He's dead.
Look.
What is it?
I'm not sure,
but I think I know
someone who can tell me.
Will you drive me
to the university?
I want to see
Professor Norman.
Of course.
I'll call and tell him
we're coming.
All right.
This powder, which
you say was scraped...
from the gray marks on
the victims' throats, is mold.
Mold?
Yes, mold.
Developed through
so many centuries...
that it's almost impossible
to calculate.
It's the same we find
in this strip of linen.
What makes you
so sure?
There's a distinct scent common
to both of them. Smell it.
It's undoubtedly
the odor of myrrh.
Comes from a tree known as
the Commiphora abyssinica,
which grows only in
parts of Africa.
So?
This reddish brown resin
is myrrh.
The other test tubes contain
cedar oil and sodium carbonate.
All those substances come
from this strip of linen.
Look. You can see
that mark...
where the linen has been
partially eaten away?
Yes, but what's it about?
Where does it come from?
That mold and this
strip of linen...
both came from the body
of a mummy.
The chemicals were used
for embalming.
There's no doubt about it.
That inky hieroglyphic
there...
is the same that's found on
the body of the Princess Ananka.
It dates back almost,
oh, 3,000 years,
to the reign
of King Amenophis,
her father.
Whether you are ready
to accept it or not,
we're dealing with the presence
of the Living Dead.
Then Babe was right,
and we wouldn't listen.
You've seen the evidence.
We've got to accept it.
Living or dead,
I'm going after it,
now that I know what
to look for.
Come on.
Telegram for
Mr. Banning.
Oh, yes.
Thank you.
The commission's
just what I wanted.
But coming at
a time like this...
I think it's wonderful.
Just what you've needed,
something to get you
away from here.
Nobody else
could reason with you.
But there's one thing certain.
You know the army won't wait.
Three days. Hardly time
to get my affairs settled.
Any things that need
attending to...
I can take care of.
You?
Sure.
You didn't think I'd leave
without taking you with me.
You've just proposed
and answered yes...
all in one breath.
Isobel, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be
so abrupt. I...
Shh!
Don't go spoiling it
by saying any more.
We'd better get started.
I have a million
things to do...
wedding preparations
and all that.
Maybe we'd just better
go to the judge's office.
No, we'll have it at home,
in memory of Dad. He'd have
wanted it that way.
All right, John.
Kharis.
Kharis, come here.
They think there will
be a marriage...
and a heir to carry on
the blood of the Bannings.
They think that, Kharis.
This time, Kharis,
I'm sending you upon
a different mission.
One of life rather
than of death.
You are eternal, Kharis.
Earthly pains and sickness
cannot touch you.
Like the age-old hills
of Egypt,
you exist,
you are.
The ancient line of the
high priests of Karnak...
must minister unto you until
the end of time, Kharis.
I shall do that
for you, Kharis, I.
I am going to take on
to myself...
a wife, Kharis.
A wife. Do you
understand that?
The one... the one who is
supposed to be the bride...
of the last
of the Bannings.
The one whom it was ordained
I should find.
Turn around, dear.
There, I think that's it.
What do you think, Ella?
Oh, she looks beautiful.
How fast they grow up, though.
You're sure you can have it
ready for tomorrow?
Oh, heavens, yes.
There isn't
much to do.
A dart here and there,
shorten the sleeves.
You're about the size
your mother was...
when she was married
in this dress.
Am I, Mother?
Someday I may be making
this dress over for
another young bride.
You never can tell.
Well, good night.
Good night, Laura.
Good night, Laura.
Together we three,
until the world crumbles...
and there is no longer
a stone or a rock...
or a tree
or a blade of grass.
That is my will, Kharis,
and you shall obey it.
Bring her here.
Go!
Go.
You've been happy,
haven't you, Mother?
We'll talk about that later.
It's time you were in bed.
Vic. Vic!
Hmm?
There's that sound again.
I'm scared.
Good night, darling.
Good night, Mother.
Sleep well.
I've asked you to meet me
at the Banning home...
because we've got
a terrible job on our hands...
and it's gonna require all
our courage to see it through.
Believe it or not,
the facts are here,
and we've got to face them.
A creature that's been alive for
3,000 years is in this town...
and it's brought death
with it.
We've got to run it down.
Thirty years ago,
my father discovered...
and violated
a sacred tomb in Egypt.
Did I hear you say
something about Egypt?
That's right.
I've been out to
the graveyard, SheriFF...
and I was talking to
the caretaker...
about a final resting place
for myself.
Yes?
And the caretaker
spoke all about Egypt...
and Quoted a lot of passages
from his Egyptian Bible.
Then when I heard you
talk here tonight,
I thought maybe he knows
something about it.
John! John!
Oh, John!
John! Isobel!
The monster took her away!
Isobel?
Yes.
John, give out those clubs.
Give out the torches.
Come on, men,
get your torches.
Where am I?
What are you doing?
There is nothing
to be afraid of.
Nothing will hurt you
ever again.
That... that creature.
Kharis? You have nothing
to fear from him.
He has brought you
here to me...
because it is your destiny
to achieve the greatest honor
that can come to a woman.
You will become the bride
of a high priest of Karnak.
No. No!
For you, I'm going
to forsake the teachings...
that have been handed down
to us for generations upon end.
The secret that has kept
Kharis alive all these years...
can be ours as well.
You're mad.
After I have given you
the tana fluid...
you will be immortal,
even as Kharis is immortal.
What I can do for you,
I can do for myself.
You will bear me a son,
and he will be brought up...
in the confines
of the tombs of Egypt,
even as I was brought up.
A new priest of Karnak...
who will carry on the
ancient and honorable line.
No. John and I, tomorrow,
we're going to be married.
There will be no marriage
between you and John Banning.
The sins of his father
are upon his head,
and only death
waits for him,
as it has for the rest
of his family.
For he who despoils
the ancient tombs of Egypt...
must die.
Oh.
One day you will
thank me for this.
Over here.
Kharis.
Take her out
and hide her...
until I get rid
of these fools.
Let's go in!
Open that door!
Come on!
Open up!
Open up in there!
Get something
to break this door down!
Quiet!
Quiet, men!
There's the man
we're after.
You gentlemen
wish to see me?
Yes. You've some
explaining to do.
What have you done
with Isobel?
With whom?
Up to now,
I've only asked questions.
Do I have
to use another method
to make you speak up?
Well?
I know nothing of any
such person, effendi.
The mummy. Isobel.
Through the woods.
Banning!
Well?
For those who defile the
temples of ancient Egypt,
a violent death
shall be their fate.
Come on, men, let's go.
Over here!
There he goes!
Get him! Come on!
If the mummy
tries to get away,
stop him with fire.
Watch the back stairs.
Don't let him get away.
Isobel. Isobel!
Oh, John.
I'm so glad we snuck out...
while the folks
are celebrating.
Hey!
