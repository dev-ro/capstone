IT'S LOVE TIME
It was a marvellous idea coming
here for the weekend.
- I'm sure we shall enjoy ourselves.
- I like the island in the autumn.
- Is there a keeper in this house Meral?
- No, we don't have one.
I think there's someone here.
How strange!
There shouldn't someone here.
I'm too scared to find out.
Let's stay here.
I'm too scared too.
All right, I'll go and look.
I'm not a thief.
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing. I'm not doing anything.
For how long have
you been coming here?
Everyday for a few months now.
But what do you do here?
- Do you want to go?
- Yes.
My friends are downstairs. I suppose
you don't want them to see you.
Yes.
You can go now if you like.
But one more question.
Who are you? What do
you do for a living?
I'm a house painter. I paint
the interior decorations.
I've been working in Ahmet
Bey's house next door.
Last year we painted
this house.
All right you can go now.
Well you finally met the original
of the picture, is she as pretty?
She's pretty of course.
Far prettier than her picture.
What will happen now? You won't
be able to go there anymore.
They don't spend the whole
winter on the island.
She didn't realize that you had fallen
in love with her picture, did she?
Maybe she did.
I don't know.
Welcome. You're
probably Miss Meral?
- I'm looking for Halil.
- He went shopping.
But he should be
back anytime now.
You've chosen very
pleasant colors.
We painted the interior
of your house too.
That's when Halil fall
in love with your picture.
He fell in love
with my picture?
How can one fall in
love with a picture?
It doesn't happen
in our day and age.
Just like in legends.
Look Miss, I never
repeat myself...
...and I never say
things I don't mean.
Halil fell in love
with you a year ago.
He fell in love very deeply.
He must have gone
to winter garden.
So you've been coming here for months
on end, just to look at my picture.
Well, why don't
you answer me?
Or are you afraid
of the truth?
Mustafa has told you
what you want to know.
I want you to
tell me yourself.
It's my right to learn something
concerning myself.
No. This doesn't
concern you.
My feelings towards your
picture are none of your business.
It's your picture I love.
But that picture is a
photograph of me...
...and I'm here in front of you. I'm ready
to hear what you have to say for yourself.
But you're not your picture.
Your picture is part of my world.
I know your picture, not you.
You might wreck all my dreams.
You act this way
because you're frightened.
Yes. I'm frightened.
Frightened, because
I don't want to lose...
...what I love.
What would happen if I fell in love
with you, instead of your image?
You would never
even look my way...
...you might even make
fun of my feelings.
Where as your picture
look on affectionely...
...and will do so forever.
I want to look at you.
No. Never! Don't step in
between your picture and me.
I'm in love with
your picture not you.
You didn't hear me come in,
just like the first time.
I didn't want to bother you again,
but I couldn't help it.
I had to come.
Please listen to me.
I want to talk to you.
But not here,
let's go for a walk.
After giving me your picture,
I didn't think you'd come anymore.
Neither did I,
but as you see, I came.
A friendship between
two people can be beautiful.
Why are you so afraid of friendship
turning into something else?
By that, you mean love I
suppose I'd say that nothing...
...in this world is
better than friendship.
Then you feel much more
than just love for me.
- No. I don't love you.
- That's impossible.
If you're in love with my picture,
it means you love me too.
I've been thinking about
your words since yesterday.
You're afraid of confessing
that you love me.
How can I confess to
something that I don't feel.
Why are you so stubborn?
I'm in love with your
picture, fullstop.
You fell in love with my picture, before
you had met me. Well, I'm here now.
I'm the original of that picture.
From now on we'll share this love.
Half of it belongs to me.
You think that friendships
are easily formed...
...that loving is easy?
If you only knew how long
I have loved your picture.
I can remember our first meeting
as if it were yesterday.
You looked at me with
love and affection.
My cloths were worn.
I was dirty and need of shave.
I couldn't believe.
I was afraid of looking at
the picture again...
...in case that human
look would have vanished.
But I forced myself
to look once more.
And again there was love
and affection in her eyes.
I had finally found
something eternal.
Those eyes looked
right inside me.
In this empty house we spent those
long cold winter nights together.
She always looked at me, with
kindness, affection and love.
There were times when
I touched her face...
...her hair and kissed her eyes.
I behold you with love too.
I also look right inside you.
From now on, I will love you instead
of my picture. From now on I exist.
No. Never. I don't want your love.
Don't try to enter my world.
You would wreck it mercilessly.
That picture is part of me now.
Let me love it.
Don't try to love me.
I don't want to hold your hands.
You'd pull them away from me.
I'm in love with your picture.
And I'll love it till I die.
Even you don't understand me,
so how can she, a stranger?
To begin with, don't call her a
stranger. She's the one whom you love.
And about me not
understanding you...
...I only say what I know. - Is
it my fault that she came that day?
If she hadn't caught me
looking at her picture...
...she wouldn't even have
know that I existed.
No, I'm not in love with her.
I'm in love with her picture.
Not even you can realise this.
Yes, but why should
she be to blame...
...because she caught you
looking at her picture?
You needn't have fallen in
love with her picture.
But since you have...
...and she knows it...
...you're bound to share
this love with her.
How can I share something
which doesn't belong to her?
My love belongs to
no one but me.
You are wrong.
You're not sensible.
This is taking things too far
into the reaim of egoism.
You sholud go to her
and say you're sorry.
- I'll not apologise to anyone.
- That's up to you.
But this no way to treat herjust
because she respond to your feelings.
Even though I look up to you...
...I don't approve of
your behaviour.
I thought people never
really fell in love.
But your passion for my picture,
destroyed my belief.
I've fallen in love with you too.
It was the only thing I could do...
...against the immensity
of your love.
I am the living image
of that picture.
But you didn't try to find me.
Whether you like or not,
I exist Halil.
Picture is me.
And I love you too.
You've tought me how to be
courageous and lonely in my love.
From now on I shall try
to match your greatness.
That's how it happened Baþar.
I've fallen in love.
How can you tell me
these things?
How can you confess that
you love someone else?
I'm supposed to be
the one you love.
No, I'm not in love with
you, Baþar.
We were close friends.
But I never said
that I love you.
Maybe you don't but
nevertheless you shouldn't...
...have told me all this after all.
You mean, I should
have fooled you?
I can't do that.
I always tell the truth.
You're under the influence of
that affair on the island.
That's clever trick, falling
in love with a picture.
You wouldn't be talking
like this otherwise.
Don't be childish Meral.
You can't love such a man.
Look at him.
He is the one I love Baþar.
What's more, he's not
aware of my feelings.
He is indifferent to
my existence.
You're out of mind
just like him.
Look, stay with me for few
days I'm sure you'll forget him.
I can't forget Halil, Baþar.
He's not so easily forgotten.
We'll see about that.
Start having a good time...
...throw away your troubles.
Then we'll talk about this once more.
I wonder if we'll enjoy
working in this house.
The good times we had on the
island seem such a long time ago.
I feel sad once a job is over Halil.
It's like the pain of a lost love.
A completed job remains me of
death. Go and find this girl Halil.
Don't suffer in vain.
You're wicked Halil.
And as long as you
don't search for her...
...you'll remain a wicked
person for me.
I would like to see
Miss Meral please.
She's out with her friends.
Would you know
where she went?
Her friends came to fetch her.
I think they went to
the shooting club.
Why are you looking for her?
I have something to
discuss with her.
Well, are you enjoying
yourself Meral?
It's no use trying to cheer
me up. I can't forget Halil.
I'm sorry, but I wish he
were here, instead of you.
My whole world is Halil.
I love him, Baþar.
Halil...
I came here to find you. Now I
don't want to see you anymore.
That's all.
Wait! Don't go!
I don't belong to this world.
Please understand me.
I didn't come here
to enjoy myself.
You don't have to explain.
But don't try to stop
me from leaving.
I've been waiting for
you for months.
- Let me go.
- Take me with you.
- I'll go alone.
- Is this your last word? - Yes.
All right then, go.
Halil!
Let go of me!
Murderer!
Halil...
I'm telling you for the last time.
If you don't stop the car
I'll throw myself out.
How can I leave you
in this weather?
Have you gone mad?
Pull yourself together.
Stop I said.
Otherwise you'll be sorry.
Even if you insist on getting out,
at least put on your shoes.
Put them on I say.
Enough of this nonsense.
You'll be sick.
Get out of here!
I don't want to see you.
I've had it.
Do what you want!
Strange. What is this
girl doing here?
Stop here. I want to get off.
Never leave me Halil. Even if
you want to, you can't leave me.
My place is beside you.
Go and speak with my father, do
what you wish, but don't leave me.
I like you young man.
You could make my daughter
a perfect husband.
Who knows how beautiful
your children would be.
You're both young beautiful,
healthy young persons.
They say that people in love
have beautiful children.
And you're goodlooking too.
Well, my girl's not bad either.
She selected a fine
man for herself.
I don't like arranged
marriages anyhow.
She can marry whoever
she pleases.
Wealth, powerty or profession
are not important for me.
All I want her happiness.
I'm ready to help...
...you both financially.
That is all.
Now, how about it young man,
am I a classical father prototype?
But let's discuss the other
side of the picture.
Look, son, Meral belongs to
a rich family.
She has never known poverty.
She's been spoilt all her life.
Yes, it's possible that
one fine autumn day...
...during weekend
trip to the island...
...she might meet and fall
in love with a man who...
...claims that he is in
love with her picture.
What a romatic and
beautiful fairy tale.
But what about tomorrow
all the morrows...
...when she will come face to
face with financial problems?
You understand what I'm
getting at, don't you?
Don't get me wrong.
I don't want to wreck...
...your beautiful castles in Spain.
I liked your father a lot Meral.
He has nothing to do
with my decision.
This is my decision.
This decision is
my death sentences.
But I won't ask
you to change it.
I think that never
in the whole world...
...has man loved woman
more than I love you.
And I will go on loving you.
That's all I have to say.
Who do you think you are,
trying to get Meral get marry you?
Answer me. I came
here to ask you.
You idiot.
How low can you stoop?
"Falling in love with her
picture"! That's clever trick...
...and then you try to marry her.
I hope you've learned
your lesson or...
...maybe you want I should
beat you some more.
I'm the one who is
marrying Meral.
She'd never marry
someone like you.
What courage, going to
see her old man?
From now on, if I catch you so
much as even looking at her...
...I'll beat the hide of you.
Say something you scumbag!
Meral ÝIter is getting married.
Belgin Uzberk made her
magnificent wedding dress.
Damn it all!
I won't forgive this!
No!
