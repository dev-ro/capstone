THE INNOCENTS
Henriette, did you bring any tools?
- What did you say?
- Did you bring up any tools?
No.
I think they're down in the car.
Remember, all this is twice as new to her.
But Dad can stay with Anna.
You and I can go on holiday together.
And I get to pick
a magazine at the airport.
That sounds nice, but Daddy has a new job.
Taking time off so soon would look weird.
And I have so much to do here.
But this will be great.
You will meet lots of kids from your
new school, and make new friends.
- But everybody's away on summer holiday.
- No, they're not. Go to sleep, now.
- Good night.
- I'm not going to sleep.
All right,
that's fine by me.
Can you stay for a little while?
No, I can't.
But I can leave the door open.
There! Now I can hear you.
Good night.
Hi.
- Are you new here?
- Yes.
Want to see something?
What?
Back where I used to live, I had
a treehouse that I built all by myself.
I had a slingshot there.
I fired it at people I didn't like.
At people I think are mean.
- Have you moved?
- Yes. Many times.
Hold this,
and stand right there.
- Should I toss it?
- No, just drop it in front of me.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Now!
Let's find a lighter one.
- Ready?
- Yes.
Now.
Wow!
How did you do that?
- I've been practicing a lot.
- Do it again.
Are you ready?
Now.
- May I try?
- Yup.
You need to focus hard, okay?
Now.
That didn't work.
Watch this.
Wow!
Ew!
That's just weird.
Can you move this?
Nope!
But I can!
It swerved, sort of.
Did he use a slingshot?
No.
He just sort of made it happen.
Be careful around slingshots.
- He knows magic?
- Yes.
- Neat.
- What's wrong?
There were also some kids playing
football.
That's good!
They wouldn't let me play, though.
They'd probably just divided into teams.
I'll do it.
I'll take the pillow.
Look at that.
A chair.
Look.
Chair.
Come over here.
There!
Dad is waiting for us, we have to go.
Always in a hurry ...
Yes, so do you.
I think my hair is a bit thicker
than yours.
Mine is much darker.
Let me show you.
This is your color, and this is mine.
Mine is darker than yours. Like that.
What a mean thing to say.
Nobody has nicer hair than anyone else.
Sorry, but you mustn't fidget so much
while I'm brushing.
Mommy?
Ow!
I'm a trained nurse.
I worked as a nurse before this.
So I know a good place when I see it.
She never speaks?
No expressive language?
She makes certain sounds, but ...
No.
She used to be able to speak ...
She was diagnosed at the age of four?
Yes, but it started earlier.
She knew a lot of words,
but lost them quite fast.
She wasn't just echoing your words?
No, she had the language
of an ordinary 3-year-old.
Maybe I should show you around, Anna?
Do you like to play?
Oh my!
So much blood! Hey ...
Hey, you ...
Anna?
- What has happened?
- There's broken glass here.
Susu!
KEEP DOOR CLOSED
Susu?
- Could you take Anna out for a while?
- No.
- Just down to the playground.
- No. I don't want to.
- Good night.
- Night night.
- Mom?
- Yes?
When I pray,
can I say something else if I want to?
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can do it the way you like.
You can pray for Daddy too, if you want.
- Can I just listen?
- What do you mean?
Just listen?
Yes ...
But that's not the same as praying.
- I think so.
- Okay.
- Good night. Sleep, now.
- Night night.
We're going many places.
We're going to town as well.
With all my friends
and my brother's friends.
You can't say stuff like that.
That's a rotten thing to do.
I have to tell someone.
Is that your sister?
She's autistic.
Stop it.
Watch this.
Can't she see?
Yes, she's just a little weird.
Are you pinching her hard?
Yes.
Want to play?
Sit here for a bit.
We won't be long.
She can sit like that for ages.
Hey. What's up?
Want the ball?
Well, do you?
Hi.
Jabba!
- Is it yours?
- No. It was here yesterday.
I named it "Jabba".
Hi, Jabba.
- Even higher up?
- Yes!
Jabba ...
Do you think it's dead?
Should we kill it?
What do you mean?
Don't!
Did you hear that?
It's warm.
- Where are you going?
- I have to go home.
Anna, come.
We have to go.
Come!
She wants to stay.
But we have to go!
Come!
Do you want to walk together?
Could you take her out tomorrow?
I'm not sure.
- Come.
- She wants to.
I can ask.
Can I take Anna outside again today?
- You want to?
- Mm.
Did that make you happy?
Can we?
Yes, just don't go far, right?
Is your phone charged?
Yes.
How many?
Five?
One castle.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Anna?
Hi.
We have to go.
- Is that you?
- No, her.
That won't work.
It's way too big.
Just try. It will work.
Stand beside them.
I think it works better together.
Ready?
Anna couldn't do it at home.
She can only do it when she's with you.
What are you guys up to?
Can you do it too?
No.
Only me and her, then?
- But you hear Anna, right?
- Yes.
- And she can hear me too.
- Can you hear me?
No. But him, a little.
What do you hear?
Just something, you know.
But with her, I feel it all the time.
We think the same things.
We think it together.
- Ready?
- Yes!
Banana.
- Banana?
- That's right!
- You couldn't hear us?
- No.
- Can you do that with Anna too?
- I can try.
- Ready?
- Yes.
Nope.
"Banana banana".
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Two bananas.
Try again.
And you won't say anything.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
"Banano"!
Correct!
I cheated.
I used her. It's much easier with her.
I can't do anything!
Let's try with you two upstairs,
and the two of us all the way down.
Hi.
All right, we're on our way.
Bye.
We forgot about dinner.
We have to go home now.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Hi! Did everything go well?
- Yes.
- What's for dessert?
- Ice cream!
Mom?
Shark!
Mommy, may I watch TV?
Okay ...
That one's bigger.
Who are you talking to?
No one.
I'm talking to someone who isn't here.
Okay.
Answer me.
Hello.
Hello!
Benjamin,
answer me when I'm talking to you.
Answer me!
What are you doing?
What is this mess?
Aisha?
Aisha?
Aisha!
Aisha!
Hey?
Hey!
Are you OK?
There was someone in my room.
It was probably just the TV.
Come, let's go to bed.
I'll sit with you for a while.
Fart!
Try going even further that way!
Down there!
"Ben is a turd."
Ben is a turd!
It's not okay to laugh at others!
She laughed at me!
No!
Are you sure?
No!
Ow.
It hurts!
Stop it!
Go away!
- Go away.
- Jerk.
She can't feel anything.
Yes, she does.
Then why isn't she crying?
She never cries.
She cries on the inside.
Yes, you can.
Just say it out loud,
like I do.
Yes, you can do it.
Just say it out loud, like I do.
No ...
You're doing it!
No ...
You said it!
You said it just now!
Hi.
Hi.
Does it hurt a lot?
It ...
It's biting me.
- Mom?
- Hello.
Did something happen?
She fell.
Are you OK?
Hey you ...
Let's take off your shoes.
Oh my God!
That must hurt so much!
What have you been up to?
- We were walking, and she fell.
- On the playground?
Don't lie to me.
I can see that this was no fall.
What happened?
Tell me.
I'm talking to you!
What happened?
Can't I trust you at all?
- She's fine.
- No, she isn't.
She is quite clearly not fine.
Come, dear.
Mommy will fix it.
You'll be fine.
Come in.
Hi.
Sorry for being so hard on you.
It's not your responsibility
to look after Anna.
It's great that you want to try.
But it's too big a responsibility.
So this is all on me.
What are you up to,
when you stay out for so long?
This and that.
I don't always remember.
What happened today, then?
You weren't actually on the playground,
were you?
I won't get angry.
I know you did your best.
I'd just really like to know
what happened.
Mommy?
- Anna is much better.
- Is she?
She plays,
and she can say things, in a way.
She can speak.
It's true.
- This isn't funny. Don't joke about it.
- I'm not!
Just stop it.
Anna?
Say something.
That's enough, Ida.
Who's that?
Can you tell me who that is?
"Mommy".
"Mommy".
Mo ...
Mo ...
Mo ...
Ida ...
Come on, you just did it!
- Say it!
- Stop it.
- Say it!
- Didn't you hear me? Stop!
I will give you one more chance
to tell me how Anna hurt herself.
No?
Then I can no longer trust you with Anna.
You get that, right?
I don't care!
Ow! Fuck!
You're laughing at me?
Any idea how much this hurts?
What the fuck is wrong ...
Aisha and I are just fine.
But I'm tired.
I work night and day.
Yes.
- Mommy?
- What?
Mommy ...
You're bleeding.
- You're bleeding.
- What?
You're bleeding here.
- Stop it.
- Your forehead is bleeding!
I'm not bleeding, Aisha.
Stop that nonsense.
It's my daughter Aisha.
Now I can hear you.
I heard about that.
Mommy ...
Benjamin!
You must call someone ...
Call an ...
Call an ...
Hi?
Anna?
Anna?
We'll tidy up.
We'll tidy up.
We're just playing.
Mm, we're just playing.
We will tidy up, Mommy.
We will.
Are you OK?
What's wrong?
I'm OK.
What's it called?
What's it called?
What's its name?
What's it called?
It goes "toot toot".
- Henriette ...
- Give her some time. She's tired.
She doesn't like it.
What could this be?
Can you tell me what it is?
It's what I drink out of.
Glass.
Glass.
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?
Who's this?
Who's this?
Can you say it?
"Daddy".
What did you say?
Daddy.
- Well done!
- That was great!
Poor boy.
It's terrible.
Poor parents.
Do you think Ida knew him?
- Do you think Ida had met him?
- No, no. She's nine. He was ...
Yeah, he was older.
14, it says here. Just awful.
- Aisha?
- Yes?
- I'd like you to stay home today.
- Why?
Because I say so.
- Don't go far today.
- OK.
You never go out on the footbridge,
do you?
No, no.
- Bye.
- Bye.
What is it?
Are you OK?
I ... can ...
... "fetch" people.
What do you mean?
I can make people do things.
What things?
Things I want them to do.
Yeah, right.
- But it's true!
- Do it on me, then.
No.
Yes.
Come on!
You're just kidding.
Don't look.
Why not?
And promise not to laugh.
- How did you do that?
- I don't know.
This was a snake.
What?
Didn't you do that?
No, that must've been you.
I just wanted to get you
onto the fridge.
- Are you afraid of snakes?
- Yes, very.
Hold it high.
- Like this?
- A bit further from your face.
Wow!
You'd much rather be like that!
When you look like that, Anna,
what are you?
- Happy.
- Yes, then you're happy!
Then you smile and fool around.
You can smile with your teeth,
or like this. Some people do that.
Just smile like this.
They're running so fast ...
What are you up to?
Wait and see.
Aisha?
Stop!
What are you doing?!
Stay out of it!
Mommy ...
My God ...
You mustn't run away like that!
Where have you been?
- Outside.
- Outside?
You can't just go out, silly.
You know you can't go out alone, right?
So great that you found her!
What is it?
We must stop him. He ...
... is out to get us.
He will hurt us.
He makes others do it.
But what are you ...
What are you planning?
You don't have to help us.
We can take care of it.
Together.
The boy who died ...
Ben did that.
But you already know that.
- Mommy, can I bring Anna outside?
- No.
- I'll look after her. I promise.
- No, don't you know what time it is?
Just for a little bit.
It's important!
Tomorrow we can go outside
and play all day.
It's suppertime.
Who'd like some?
- Mommy?
- Yes?
May I sleep in your room tonight?
- Are you scared?
- Yes.
Come, now.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Mommy?
- Yes?
- Are you working tonight?
- No, not tonight.
- When will you go to bed?
- Quite soon.
Try to get some sleep, now.
Mommy?
Mommy?
- Yes?
- Can you get Boffa for me?
- Where is it?
- In my bed.
OK. I'll find him for you.
Anna?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Anna?
Don't be like that!
Stop it, Mommy!
Aisha?
Aisha!
- Mommy?
- Yes ...
You'll be fine.
You'll be fine!
She's bleeding a lot!
Come quick!
Our address is Odvar Solbergs Plass 85.
Come quick!
Aisha.
- Can I have a band aid?
- Yes, you can.
Aisha, they're on their way!
Please!
Aisha!
Aisha, you must wake up.
Wake up!
Aisha, please ...
Hi.
You knew her a little, didn't you?
Yes.
Oh dear.
That was horrible.
But ...
You or Mommy
could never do anything like that, right?
No!
Ida, baby girl ...
No!
Don't you ever think like that.
Of course not!
We would never harm you.
Her mommy was sick.
Sick in the mind.
She was all alone, and ...
It's completely different.
We'd never do something like that to you.
You know that, right?
Yes.
Come, now.
Anna, are you coming?
What the ...
Let's go.
Please!
I can't do anything!
Please wake up!
He's going to get us!
Please!
I'm sorry.
- Mommy?
- Yes?
What do you do
when someone's mean?
Has someone been mean to you?
No, no.
But what if someone is mean?
Or going to do something mean?
Then you tell it to a grown-up.
What if you are a grown-up?
Then you may have
to take care of it on your own.
Or go to the police,
if they can help.
Are you sure
no one is being mean to you?
No.
Okay.
Sleep tight.
Sleep tight.
- I'll go outside.
- OK.
- Mommy?
- Yes?
Oh dear.
Are you OK?
Hey ...
Bye.
Bye ...
Who is it?
It's Ida.
Wait there, I'll come down.
Hi.
Hi.
Do you want to do something?
Where's your sister?
She's at home.
She's not doing that well.
What do you have there?
- Come on!
- Where are we going?
We need some altitude!
- Want to throw it?
- Okay!
It'll get destroyed!
Here you go.
It's better over here.
Shit, it's going to hit a car!
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Hey! Get down from there!
Get down!
Hey, stop!
Hey, you!
Come back!
Hey!
Ow!
Hey ...
Hey, it's Mommy.
You're in the hospital.
How are you?
Yes.
They say you have a concussion.
So if you can't remember everything,
that's completely normal.
What happened to the boy?
He's fine.
Apparently, he got up and ran away.
Is he a friend of yours?
Ida ...
Who is he?
Ida?
I don't know.
That's odd, because
someone said it looked like you ...
That you pushed him over on purpose.
What really happened?
We were just playing.
OK.
That's OK.
There!
I'll take those.
- Are you OK?
- Yes.
People are coming home from vacation.
What was that?
Nothing.
Ida?
I forgot to buy something.
Can you stay here with Anna for a bit?
Yes, that's fine.
Bye!
Mommy?
Mommy?
Anna?
Anna!
Hello, girls.
There's an ambulance outside.
You may see it from the balcony.
Everything went well?
What happened to your cast?
Oh!
Oh dear.
Mommy ...
There, there.
There, there, little one.
