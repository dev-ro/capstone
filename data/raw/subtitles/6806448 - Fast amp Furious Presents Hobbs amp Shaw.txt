Oh, by the way, your
Old Man and the Sea report...
- Mm-hmm.
- ...from last week?
You did so good.
It was awesome.
- Thanks, Daddy.
- Give me some. Yes. Yeah.
What's that?
Um, it's a social studies
assignment.
It's a family tree.
It's just a sketch.
HOBBS:
Oh, yeah.
That's our family tree
right there.
It's, uh...
it's super easy to read
and very clear.
Yeah.
But I was going to use this.
I found it in a garage drawer.
That's you, isn't it?
Who's Jonah?
Is that your brother?
(smacks lips)
Yup. That's my brother.
Why don't you ever
talk about Samoa?
Did something happen?
In life, things happen.
You may not want them to,
but they do.
You just got to do your best...
and move on.
And the fact of the matter is
I'm your family.
I'm your people.
- Me.
- And you're a whole lot.
- Oh, I am a whole lot.
- (chuckles)
Look at this.
Perfect timing.
Oh, no, this is the mini.
- Yup.
- Thank you so much.
- Cheat day?
- Cheat day.
Yeah. Thank you so much.
Is that really necessary?
Come on!
She's 71 years old.
What's the matter with you lot?
Sir, the prisoner will
only be allowed more leniency
when she proves to be
less of a security risk.
If someone leaves
a back door open,
it's a bit daft
not to try and use it.
What's daft is paying one of
the screws to leave it open
but not paying them enough
to keep their mouth shut.
Yeah, well,
my point still stands.
If you can't break out of
a shitty prison like this,
then you're
seriously slipping, Mum.
You cheeky bugger.
Speaking of breaking out,
where's my birthday cake?
What, the one
with the file in it?
- They're baking it.
- Who wants a bloody file?
What I want is
a nice little bit of C-4.
Listen, if you want
out of here,
just say the word;
I'll handle it.
Oh, Decks, I'm just having
a bit of fun, really.
Being banged up
doesn't bother me.
I quite enjoy
the peace and quiet.
You know, nice walk, bit of
reading, loads of sudoku.
It's like being retired.
Love it.
Now, listen, have you spoken
with your sister?
You know I haven't, Mum.
- Give me your hand.
- There she goes.
I mean, you and your sister,
y-you used to be inseparable.
What happened, Decks?
What happened between you?
I remember you, Owen and Hattie
playing out in the backyard.
Your little games,
your little grifts.
Oh, robbing banks.
You used to give
your little scams code names.
(laughs):
Do you remember?
Oh, what was that one?
- Um...
- The Keith Moon.
MAGDALENE:
(laughs) Yeah, that's right.
It was called "The Keith Moon"
because it...
SHAW: It involved
lots of explosive percussion
and permanent ear damage.
♪ Yeah! ♪
(laughs)
That's my boy.
No wonder we left
the family business.
She loves you, you know.
All you got to do is
pick up the phone, Decks.
Look at me.
You're her big brother.
She looks up to you.
Used to.
Well, one day, I just hope
that I walk through that door
and I see the two of you
sitting there.
How many years you got left?
Two, with good behavior.
- So how many, really?
- Four.
Well, you know what they say.
Never say never.
GUARD:
Time's up.
- You behave yourself.
- Will do.
Love you, darling.
(kisses)
Love you, too. (kisses)
(Magdalene laughs)
(music playing quietly
over speakers)
All right.
LOCKE:
Lucas Rebecca Hobbs.
I haven't seen you in forever.
- "Rebecca"?
- Do you even age?
- How long's it been?
- Six months.
- Time flies.
- When we're apart.
What is your skin care regimen?
- Because you look like...
- Don't sit down.
...a young Shirley Temple.
(whispers): Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.
Daddy, who is this guy?
Well, this guy is,
uh, is Locke.
And he works for the CIA.
Dad and I are old friends.
- We're not old friends.
- Actually, we're, um...
we're best friends.
Here's the half heart.
- I don't know what that is.
- Right there.
We got some ink together
as well.
- We did not get ink together.
- Oh, we didn't?
- No, we did not.
- Huh. Interesting.
- We never got ink together.
- Well, I seem to remember
getting a little something
like this
- at one point on my body.
- Jesus.
Christ, I miss
our playful banter.
You have one minute
to tell me what you want
before I knock
one of your lungs loose.
You and I are
after the same thing.
Say hello to the CT17 virus.
It's a programmable bioweapon
of biblical proportions,
affectionately code-named
"the Snowflake."
- What does the Snowflake do?
- Oh, nothing much.
Just, uh, liquefies
your internal organs.
Basically turns your body
into a giant bag of hot soup.
- She is nine.
- Seen worse.
- Where?
- Game of Thrones.
- Janet's house.
- I've never heard of it.
A Lannister always
pays his debts.
You're never
going over there again.
LOCKE: But there's a new
wrinkle in the case, Rebecca.
The specifics are
all in the brief.
There you go.
- She's ready, Becca.
- She's nine. She's nine.
This is the only unit
of CT17 in existence,
and this Snowflake
is now in the hands
of a rogue MI6 operative
in London.
Dad, are all spies that pretty?
No. She is
unusually attractive.
And deadly. Last night,
she was part of an MI6 team
tasked with securing the virus.
She then proceeded to kill
her entire black ops squad.
She stabbed one guy
in the chest using a brick.
Do you know how hard that is?
- To stab someone using a brick?
- Get to the point.
The point is
there's no sharp edge.
How did she get an entire brick
into another person's chest?
She either had to be really
strong or the other person
had to have been, like,
born without, like, bones.
- Get to the larger point.
- She stole the Snowflake.
- She went totally off-grid.
- Who's this?
That's the scientist
we believe created the virus.
Great.
Where do I find him?
He's off-grid, too.
Impossible to find.
- Maybe dead.
- You're very helpful, Locke.
And you're
the world's best tracker.
I'm sure you'll
figure something out.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm DSS, you're CIA.
- I don't work for you.
- Your boss loaned you out.
You do now, dick face.
- What did you call me?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Let's just settle down.
All right?
We've already got a black site
running in London.
There's an operative there,
top of his game.
- He'll be your contact.
- I don't need anybody else.
- I work alone.
- We got bigger problems
than your fragile ego
or the fact that
a moment ago I most definitely
shit my pants.
The entire world is
at stake here, all right?
This thing gets out,
we're looking at a lot of
liquefied organs,
and I mean, like, everywhere.
And not just yours and mine.
Uh, he knows
I can see him, right?
He knows nothing, Jon Snow.
(Sam chuckles)
So what's it gonna be, Becky?
You gonna partner up?
- I'm in.
- Of course you are.
Do you remember
what I told you in Rwanda?
- "It still burns"?
- No. The other thing.
"Stop watching me sleep."
I said, "We are not..."
- We're best friends.
- "...friends at all."
- And to watch your back.
- Wash your back.
- Yeah. I remember.
- W-Watch your back.
Lot of back. I got you. Hey.
Same old Hobbs, huh?
Same old Locke.
All right.
Who's on the case?
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)
Mr. Shaw.
Whatever it is,
I ain't buying it.
Hm, you don't know
what I'm selling or who I am.
- CIA.
- How can you...
Sunglasses, cloudy day,
sensible shoes.
Okay, well, these are...
I have fallen arches,
and I don't have
a lot of choice in what I...
Anyway, uh, I'm Agent Loeb,
and I need to talk to you
- about our shared interest.
- Hey, how'd you find me?
I got a tip from
an acquaintance of yours:
- Mr. Nobody.
- Mr. Nobody.
Little joke for you, Loeb.
What do, uh, CIA operatives
and baseballs have in common?
People cheer when
you hit them with a bat.
No.
They are two things
I don't give a toss about.
- That works, too.
- (car door opens)
The weapon she's stolen is not
like anything we've ever seen.
It's a programmable disease
that can target
any DNA sequence
with a 100% mortality rate
inside 72 hours.
If MI6 finds her,
they're gonna treat her
like a traitor.
MAN (over phone): We need you
to surrender the virus.
What is your location?
What, you think I killed them?
LOEB:
But if you help us find her,
if you bring us the virus,
we'll grant her immunity.
We've set up a black site
here in London.
You've got everything you could
need at your disposal,
and we're bringing in an asset
from the States to assist you.
I don't need anybody.
Maybe not, Mr. Shaw,
but she does.
- My guy's in.
- My guy's in, too.
Hey, is your guy
gonna freak out
when he finds out
who my guy is?
I mean, didn't they just do
a job together in New York?
Yeah, but didn't they just
destroy the DSS field office
in L.A. by throwing each other
through it? I don't know.
Look, I don't know about
your guy, but my guy?
He's gonna get this.
He's gonna pull this off.
You know why?
We've been best friends
our whole goddamn lives.
Well, my guy beat the shit
out of me at a bar in Kraków
17 years ago, and he doesn't
even remember me.
So, we all have our histories.
Anyway, it's the fate
of the world here.
It's the fate of the world.
The planet's population
is in their hands.
- Serious stuff.
- I mean, you'd think they'd be able
to put aside any petty
rivalries to save the world.
- Mm. Mm.
- (slurping)
BOTH:
No fucking way.
No, I'm not working
with this guy.
I been there, done that.
Hey, the minute
he gets involved,
you can kiss goodbye
to any finesse,
because She-Hulk here
only knows how to smash.
Yeah, and Mr. Arson here
only knows how to blow shit up.
- And the fact is...
- And the fact is...
- No offense.
- Oh, no offense.
BOTH:
This guy's a real asshole.
That's, uh, "sumbitch"
in your native tongue.
That'd be "wanker"
in your native tongue.
Are you finished blubbering?
You sound like
a giant tattooed baby.
You know what, I'm not
listening to this horseshit.
I got a job to do.
Tell your mom I said hi.
Actually, I'll tell her myself.
Don't you ever talk
about my mother.
I'll put your head
through that wall.
Secondly,
I'll have this job done
while you're still putting on
your baby oil.
Good luck, slick.
- (snaps fingers)
- That's it.
You just reminded me.
That's exactly why I hate
working with you.
It's your voice.
It's your nasally,
prepubescent,
Harry Potter voice.
Every time you speak...
just imagine this
for a second...
it's like dragging my balls
across shattered glass.
And it hurts.
Well, for me,
it's not your voice.
It's your face.
Your big, stupid face.
Looking at it
makes me feel like
God is projectile-vomiting
right in my eyes.
And it burns.
(inhales deeply)
It really burns.
(chair creaking)
What you gonna do now?
Throw a bit of furniture?
For your information,
I was gonna take this chair
and turn it sideways
and shove it
- right down your throat.
- Of course you were,
'cause that's your answer
to everything.
Smash a hole through every
problem in a massive truck.
But that's not gonna work here.
- Ah, I think it'll work fine.
- AGENT: Guys?
Why don't you two take a seat
and we'll talk through this?
(feedback squeals)
Me and you, us...
I've been down this road.
It's a total waste of time.
For once, I couldn't agree
with you more.
Yeah?
Well, I'm doing this my way.
If anyone's got
a problem with that,
I suggest you come out here
and stop me.
I'm not going in there.
Well, I'm not going in there.
Smart lads.
HOBBS:
All right. (chuckles)
Now that we got rid of that
fun sponge, we can get to work.
I want you to pull up every
CCTV camera
around Central London.
We already have two dozen
agents scouring footage...
Don't you talk back
to me, Opie. Uh-uh.
I just care about the coverage.
I ain't gonna ask you again.
Now pull it up.
Now zoom in on the area
of the heist.
- Now invert it.
- (typing)
Highlight the areas
that the cameras don't cover.
She's smart.
She just killed her entire team
and stole a deadly virus.
She ain't waiting around
for no picture.

Promises, promises.

So here's how it's

We do this the hard way

Are you serious?
- I am.
- Really?

Well, it's a tough decision.
No, it's really not.

Fine.
But you're not gonna like

Think I made up my mind.
- You seem like a smart woman.
- I am.
The hard way.
(grunting and groaning)

Hold on, I ju... (grunts)

I wish a lot of things
right now.
You're gonna go to sleep now.
It's all gonna seem
like a bad dream.
It's more like a nightmare.
This whole thing is a nightmare.
All right, let's me and you
have a little chat.
(growls)
(grunting, yelling)
(metal clangs on floor)
(grenade spinning on floor)
- (beeping)
- (panting)
SCIENTIST:
The director called.
He ordered a new baseline
for you.
He has everything ready
for you in medical.
DIRECTOR (distorted voice):
Perfection is
a painful process, Brixton,
in ourselves and in the pursuit
of a perfect world.
Humanity must evolve
before it destroys itself.
- Eteon will carve out all human weakness...
- (yells)
...and replace it
with mechanical perfection.
And you will lead the way.
I'm gonna ask you a question.
It's not what you think it is.
Do you like to dance?
What, the Electric Slide?
The Macarena?
No, I don't.
No, no, no,
I was thinking about...
the tango, where it takes two.
Yeah, don't know that one.
Must be different generations.
(laughs)
Yeah, well, either way,
the music started,
so let's see what kind
of rhythm you have.
- Where's the virus?
- Look, I told you, I've no idea
- what you're talking about.
- Okay, that hurt.
You just stepped on my toes.
That didn't feel good.
Let's try it again.
I think you're better than that.
- Where's the virus?
- I didn't ask to dance.
And why should I talk to you?
You're not CIA.
No? How do you know that?
Where shall I start?
There's two types
of CIA agents:
intelligence and espionage.
Those guys over there
can barely lift a pencil.
That's what intelligence agents
look like.
And you look like
you could pick up a building.
But espionage is about
blending in,
about being subtle, and there
is nothing subtle about you.
Yeah.
That's good.
I'm impressed.
I didn't kill anybody.
I know you didn't.
How do you know that, then?
Because you can learn a lot
about somebody
when you fight them,
and when we fought,
you weren't fighting to kill me.
You were fighting to run away.
But either way, the world thinks
that you're a murderer
and a thief,
so you're not going anywhere or
getting any goddamn phone call
until you give me
some real answers.
You have no idea
what is happening here.
Then tell me.
Help me understand.
- I can't.
- Then I can't, either.
- You're wasting my time.
- You're wasting time.
Virus gets in the wrong hands,
that's it... it's game over.
(alarm ringing)
(chuckles)
Does that mean it's time
for curls?
Just like the CIA, always
flexing the wrong muscle.
You know, the mind is the
strongest muscle in the body.
Maybe you should try exercising
that a little bit more.
"There's more wisdom
in your body

You know, Dad, sometimes people

Okay, look, uh,

No, I d...

Listen to me, pinhead.

Update.
I've hacked the mainframe
of every news agency

How many do we control?
- 174 broadcasts, 2,000-odd online.
- Double it.
I want 100% control
of this story.
- A standard frame job.
- No, standard will not do.
I need something special
for these guys.
So listen up. Narrative:
Hobbs, Shaw...
big guy, little guy...
have been I.D.'d.
They've been blamed for
the recent attacks on the CIA.
They shared a prison cell
where they hatched a plan
to start their reign of terror.
Just got real.
HATTIE:
Who the hell are these guys?
SHAW:
Eteon.
They're a secret tech cult
with a mercenary army
and plenty of dark money.
UK.
SHAW: And delusions
of saving the world
by augmenting the human race.
That's it.
Apparently, they control
the media as well.
Heard rumors
about these people.
Everybody thinks they're a myth.
SHAW: I've seen it firsthand
how real they are.
If you don't fit
into their plans,
- you've already dug your own grave.
- All right.
Let's get to the nearest
lockdown facility...
Hey, no, no, no, no.
You don't get it, do you?
Brixton's a tier-one assassin.
Best I've ever seen.
I know him.
He ain't never gonna stop
until he gets that virus.
And besides, that's my sister.
Family business.
Is your name Shaw?
No. Then she's going
nowhere with you.
HOBBS:
When it comes to the fate
of the world,
it becomes my business.
I don't care if
she's your sister.
That woman ain't going
anywhere...
- BOTH: Where are you going?
- I'm going away.
I don't have time for
your alpha male shit right now.
You're both idiots. You clearly
can't work together,
and so you're absolutely
useless to me.
So I'm gonna go find the man
who can help me get this thing
out of my system.
- See you.
- HOBBS: You mean this man?
I was tracking him
before the attack.
He's hard to find, but I think
I got a hell of a lead.
- Russian newspaper.
- Not just any old paper.
There's only one place
in London that sells that.
(indistinct newscast playing)
(grunting)
(panting quietly)
Call the director.
(whirring, line ringing)
DIRECTOR:
Well, well. Deckard Shaw.
How complicated for you.
Not really.
He's also working with DSS,
Luke Hobbs.
Hobbs.
We have a history.
They're formidable.
Small fry.
I'll eliminate the two of them,
get the asset back ASAP.
You get the girl,
extract the virus
and reprogram it for phase one.
We use that weapon
to eliminate the weak
and anyone who would get
in our way.
We're building
the perfect system, Brixton.
Hobbs and Shaw can be
considerable assets for Eteon.
- Turn them.
- Turn 'em?
Sorry, I don't follow.
I want them turned.
I want them working
for the cause.
Understood?
They can't be turned.
What makes you so certain?
The last time we asked,
I got shot in the face.
That makes me very certain.
So I suggest that we take
another approach.
- Which is why...
- I'm not asking, Brixton.
You show them
the consequences of refusal.
Or perhaps
I'll show them to you.
Is that a threat?
I'd remember who you're
reliant on for your survival.
All for the cause.
Look, honey, I have to talk
to you about something.
It's very important right now.
Remember how we spoke about
what would happen
if things went sideways?
We called it a "code red."
Well, it's happening.
Is there anything I can do?
You need to stay home.
You're gonna be safe there.
As a matter of fact,
we've got the CIA
listening in on this call
right now.
Watch this. Hi, Locke.
Everybody's safe.
Everybody's great.
I'm actually at our old, uh...
our old diner here.
It's super weird being here
without you guys.
Think it's closed.
Thank you, brother.
Honey, I've already talked
to Aunt Lisa.
She knows exactly what to do.
I'm gonna be home
as soon as I can.
Love you.
I love you back.
Goodbye.
Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw.
While Hobbs is an agent
in the American...
Tell us everything you know...
about this.
My God, wh-when were you
exposed?
HATTIE:
About 30 hours ago.
Then the capsules
containing the virus
- are still intact.
- So we need to neutralize it.
No, it is not that easy.
It's not programmed
to any DNA sequence.
It's fatal to everyone.
In 42 hours,
the capsules will dissolve,
and she will be infected.
Then the virus
will go airborne.
We are talking global
contamination within a week.
Why in the hell would you
create something like that?
Because I thought
I was one of them.
- Eteon.
- They told me
they wanted to save the world
through science.
I believed in their cause.
I developed the Snowflake
to be a carrier for vaccines,
a panacea for the whole world,
but they redeveloped it
into a programmable apocalypse
to attack the weakest of us,
those not worthy
of Eteon's vision of the future.
For a scientist,
you seem incredibly stupid.
Well, I'm a two-times
Nobel Prize winner,
but who's counting?
All right, you said
the virus is programmable.
So... reprogram it.
I can't reprogram it in a host.
Just tell us how to get
this thing out from me.
Well, there are two options,
and the first is easy.
- Go.
- Finally.
- You kill her.
- Excuse me?
Oh, and burn the body,
of course.
- Of course.
- Of course.
- No, I mean really burn it.
- Really burn it?
- To ash.
- To ash?
- Beyond all recognition.
- Let's assume that that's not
an option, shall we, genius?
Yeah, it doesn't work for us.
Option number two.
There is a machine
that could preserve her life
- and extract the virus.
- HOBBS: Well, that should've
been option number one.
Because it's impossible
to get to.
We'll decide what's impossible.
Where is it?
It's in the Eteon laboratory
where the Snowflake
was developed.
A secret dark-tech complex
fortified by an army
in the most godforsaken part
of the planet.
But if you go there,
all three of you will die.
So, basically,

she dies no matter what.

to ring Eteon's dinner bell.
Oh, I can handle that part.
But first,
let's get you geared up.
These are your HALO parachutes.
Earbuds for
encrypted communication.
Scorpion EVO 3

Ultrathin
bullet-resisting Kevlar.
Infrared cameras

And last but not least,
compact hydrogen detonator.
Put it in the right spot,
it'll blow the place sky-high.
How do I look?
Looks a little tight.
How you holding up?
You know, if things
go south in there,
you can't leave me alive.
We're gonna get you
out of there.
And let me tell you
something else.
"The key to immortality
is first living a life
worth remembering."
Is that more Nietzsche?
Nah. That's Bruce Lee.

BRIXTON:

MARGARITA:
You've heard about me.
I'm good at my job.
BRIXTON:

Yeah.

Do you wash the blood
