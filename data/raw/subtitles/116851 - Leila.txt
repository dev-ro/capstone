Peace be upon the prophet
Mohammad and his household
Don't burn it
- Turn down the fire
- We already did that
Easy
Wait
Bring the rose water Nazgol
That's enough
Don't pour anymore
it's enough
People will say there's no color
to the '' Sholeh Zard '' mother
Give it to me
Let Leyla stir some
- The saffron is enough now
- Go Golnaz
Pour the rose water
- Anyone who has a wish can stir it
- Should I pour it Aziz?
Go on dear
Say prayers while you do it
Peace be upon the prophet Mohammad
and his household
Keep doing it
More rose water Aziz?
- Make wishes
- Oh Imam Hasan
Make any wishes you want to
Let me taste it a bit dear
You keep eating uncle
But it has to be tasted, doesn't it?
Don't move it too much
Go on Hossein, go on dear
- Hi Hossein
- Hi Amir
How are you?
They're cooking '' Sholeh Zard '' over at my
friend's house and he's brought you some
The guys are here uncle
- Uncle!
- Yes?
- Hi
- May it be accepted by God
- My friend Reza
- Hi Reza, how are you?
He brought us some '' Sholeh Zard ''
Leyla, Reza is Amir's friend
he's brought us some Sholeh Zard
Would you fill this for Narges auntie?
Reza is one of my good friends
Welcome, thanks a lot
We were busy too...
The first time I saw Reza...
It was during the cooking of Sholeh Zard
Reza had brought a bowl of Sholeh Zard
for my brother Hossein
Let's judge them all
I want to know where I'm standing
Who is better? Me or your friend Reza?
A little of this and some of that
Have some of this one first
I'll test the one Reza brought first
Amir is mutual
Which one is better honestly?
This one is tasteless
Here, look at this one
We're one up as far as the
sweetness is concerend
And as far as the decoration is concerned too
and the color
The nuts are better too
This is grade one Pistachio uncle
I married Reza in the same year
A couple of months later on my birthday...
I realized I couldn't get pregnant
What is this?
How pretty!
Let me see, where did you get it?
- They call him the big jackass
- Oh Reza!
It's so cute!
- It's even as tall as I am
- It looks like you too
Where did you get it?
Look at the hair
Is this mine as well? How pretty
- Let me see, give it to me
- Hold on, you're tearing it
What are you laughing at?
What are you laughing at?
I'm choking
I know what you're laughing at
- Do you want me to tell you?
- Go on
I'll tell you if you don't
- Go on
- Should I?
- Should I?
- Go on
- I will you know!
- Go ahead
The night we were invited
at your mother's house
My husband's family knew
it was my birthday too
So we arranged to go there first
and then to go to my mother's house
- Hi
- Hi, how are you?
- Come in
- Are you alright?
Happy birthday
Why did you open the door dad?
Isn't Mohammad in?
He wanted to get the door himself
Why are you so late?
I was waiting for you
Reza takes for hours...
To get ready dad
Come in
- Look at the flowers they brought you
- Thanks, thanks Leyla
- Hi
- Happy birthday
- Hi my dear Reza
- Hi brother
- Hi
- How are you?
- Happy birthday
- Thanks
- Sit next to me Leyla
- Okay
- Welcome guys
- The traffic is horrible out there...
- Reza driving and...
- Leyla took her sweet time too
How old are you now?
What a question lady
About your age
I got you something small Leyla
I hope you like it
Without wrapping for your petite fingers
Wow dad!
Thanks a lot, it's pretty
This is what's written on it,
'' The kingdom belongs to God ''
I also have a small gift for you Leyla
I hope you like it
I don't know what to say mother
It's nothing for you dear
Hopefully next year at the same time
with your pretty little boy...
We'll have a huge party right here
We'll invite your mother
and your brothers as well
We'll see each other here
I can't tell you how much I want
to see Reza's boy
- Hi brother, hi Leyla
- Hi Homeyra, how are you?
- Hi Reza
- Hi Javaher
- Thanks a lot
- This was brought from Mashad
- It's nothing for you
- Thank you
- Here you go
- Thanks Gol Mohammad
And this is my gift to you
And it's bigger than all others
And more expensive
It's more recreational
Specially for Reza
- I don't know what to say
- It's nothing dear
Reza loves to drink tea
He drinks tea all day
And this is for you
But only if you promise not to make
delicious food or my brother will get fat
Don't worry, he has a long way to go
We'll beat him up if he's a bad husband
Oh no, don't say that
Leyla, it's Farideh on the phone
- It's for you
- Thanks
Yes?
- Hi Leyla
- Hi Farideh
- Happy birthday
- Thanks
Hopefully your birthday
- I've gotten you something small and I'll give it to you later
- Why did you bother?
It's nothing for you
Thanks
Say, what did the father give you?
A chrysoprase ring
So he must really love you then
The ring used to belong to my mother
- Let me see it later
- Okay, fine
- Bye
- Thanks dear, bye
I'm feeling great God!
I feel like I'm flying
Over the clouds
Thank you God
Thanks
- Reza!
- Yes?
How many children would you like to have?
Two a year
I'm serious
I don't know, what kind of a question is that?
A hundred, or two
The more the better
- What if I can't get pregnant?
- That's even better
So you won't divorce me if I can't have babies?
Hear this once and for all
I want you for yourself
And not for babies and anything else
This creature is called Leyla
This creature wants to have babies
And not just one or two
But a couple of hundred ones
- Hi
- Hi
Happy birthday
- Hi Aziz, how are you?
- Hi
Why can't we carry on with this
somewhere warm instead of freezing?
How dare you say I've grown old?
See how it takes me an hour to move
this heavy fire-pan?
Go on Hossein, play on
Just a moment please
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to give
Leyla's present before dinner
Hold on
One of this is from me to you Leyla
And the other one is from my dear spouse
- And it's nothing for you
- Thanks a lot
It's not my fault, it was her choice
- Wow Aziz, I love you
- Leyla dear
Now to the next present
Your name and Reza's name both
are carved on it
Thank you very much
I can't believe it
You should have done more
Nazgol's present
It's directly from Paris
Any more presents?
Yes from your dear uncle
A pair of canaries all in one piece
Thanks a lot
Well, Hossein's present
And this is from all the pigeons and canaries
The next day me and Reza went to the doctor
I told her that it was a while
since we got married and?
That I still wasn't pregnant
She said...
It happens all the time,
There's nothing to worry about
Sometimes it can be genetic
And nothing can be done about that
But if men have the problem...
Then there's definitely nothing can be done
But if it's the woman...
It's possible to do things...
With treatments or even surgeries
to become pregnant
Nevertheless I'll have you tested
Bring me the result and I'll know then
Next Sunday the same time
If you have a problem...
It's not important to me at all
I'm quite happy with what we've got right now
But what if I have a problem?
I'm happy with what we have as it is as well
What he said calmed me down a lot
I felt I was not alone
But promise not to tell anyone till Sunday
No one
I promise
Yes?
- Hi leyla
- Hi, how are you?
- Are you alright?
- Thanks, nice of you to ask
Where were you?
To see the doctor?
- Yes
- How did it go?
What did she say dear?
He's going to take a test
- Is that so?
- Who is it?
- Which laboratory?
- Is that mother?
You'd have to be sure
He can't go to just any place Leyla
It's not a joke,
they might give him a wrong result
But you should know Leyla
That Reza doesn't have any problems
We've never had anything like
this in the family before
Thank God Reza's ancestors...
All had all kinds of children
- And you know Reza has four sisters
- Give me the phone
I wish them all the best
- Hi mother, how are you?
- Hi Reza
This is not a good time for this mother
But I now you're not the one with the problem
- It doesn't matter
- What do you mean?
It matters a lot
But we still don't even know what's what yet
Why don't you come here for dinner
- Thanks but I don't think so, bye
- Bye
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Hi
- How is it going?
- You're alright?
- I want to talk to Leyla
Parvin wants to talk to you
Tell her I have a headache
Can't talk
Leyla isn't feeling well
And neither am I
What did the doctor say?
We have to take different tests
Ask mother, she'll tell you all about it
- Can't you tell me yourself, spoiled brat?
- Okay
- What okay?
- Bye
Hello?
- Hi Reza
- Hi Firouzeh, is it you?
How did it go?
Tell me
What's going on?
Why are you so worried?
I'm not worried but I do want to know...
You'd have to wait for the results
I hope it's all good and well
But you need not worry Reza
It's not a problem from our side
It make no difference to us
- It's six of one or half a dozen of the other, bye
- Bye
Listen Leyla...
Don't answer it, it's either mother
or my other sister
- Don't get hurt
- I'm not
Believe me what I told you
Don't get carried away by
what everyone's saying
I understand
You are the only son of the family after all
It's only natural you have to have a son
It'll be alright hopefully
Let's not talk about it for now, okay?
What should we do tonight Leyla?
I don't know
Whatever you say
I think...
Let's stay home, we'll cook something up
We'll eat, and we'll enjoy each other
And we'll watch a movie afterwards
How is that?
Leyla!
Leyla!
Okay then, it's great
This must be my dear auntie
[ Come on }
[ Hurry up }
You don't have any problems
It's from the lady
According to the tests...
Your hormone count is very low
And in order for you to be
able to hold the sperms...
You'd have to produce strogens
or progestrones
Is there a cure for it?
I really don't know,
I'll write you some medicine
You might get suggested of various
ways to get pregnant but...
It's very unlikely with
such a low count of hormones
One way to cure is Pulsatale
Administration of Gonadotropin
It helps you to produce more
than just one egg
Six or seven until one of them
comes through for you
Another solution is artificial insemination
Of course it's very expensive
and it takes a long time
And you'd have to go on the
waiting list a year bef ore doing it
But if someone can't hold the baby at all...
She'd have to lay down for nine whole months
With no movements and take
Hormone injections
Yes? Hello
Sure, you can come over
Next week, yes
Don't worry about that
I've checked your test results
You don't have any problems
But do come here
I need to change your medication
No, no problems at all
Sure thing, bye
Leyla!
Don't cry outside please
For God's sake Leyla!
Let's go
Where to?
Home
But if mother should call,
that I'm sure she will...
- You talk to her
- Okay
And you promise me
to forget this totally
I do not want a baby, and that's that
Please Leyla
Don't make this into a hell
I swear to God it's not important to me
You know it
Leyla!
Don't cry please
Nothing's for certain yet
Didn't you hear the doctor say
That there are all kinds of cures and tests
Besides we've only checked with one doctor
I was busy carrying out the lady
doctor's orders for a long time
I used to take hormone pills
like crazy at first
But they were no use
Next I went to do the Pulsatale
Administration of Gonadotropin
But after going through a lot of trouble
The daily examinations didn't work
Reza no longer agreed with
the artificial insemination
And I wasn't too thrilled about Endoscope
Specially since I had to go on the
waiting the waiting list for a year
Not knowing whether it would help or not
And during this period I was tossed
from one doctor to another
And between new medications
and traditional ones, everywhere
Even one day me and Reza went to
an orphanage to adopt a child
A couple who come to us to adopt a child...
Must have certain criteria
They have to be Muslims and educated
They most certainly need to have...
Economical, social...
Cultural and religious conditions
Most importantly they need to show
proof that they can't have a baby
In order to start a file...
They need to go to the city court
And present certain documents there
And then they'll be ref erred to
The Ameneh Orphanage
Once their residence is checked out...
And once the family gets
approved in every way...
They'd still need to go on the waiting list...
That's because we are short on children
And there are many families on the waiting list
Who request a baby girl
Small girls who won't have
any religious problems
But there's no way to tell and
it might take up to two years
Just a moment, don't raise your arm
...tells the rabbit that
He'd pull out its teeth if
it went there one more time
But the rabbit goes again and asks for carrots
and the guy pulls its teeth out
So the next day the rabbit goes
and asks for carrot juice!
Well, what do you think?
I don't know, it's hard
They all feel to be strangers
Although some of them are truly angels
Why don't you tell him
what's on your mind?
Why won't you tell him that
why do you want to raise...
Someone else's child
when you can have your own?
You know what Reza?
I think this is very selfish of me in a way
You can have babies
Why do you have to raise
someone elses' kid?
Who wants some Kebab?
Give me some tomato
Tomato is an excuse for you to
eat the Kebab, right?
Reza!
Careful not to drop the child
Okay, I'm careful
Poor thing hasn't had any experiences
It's not is fault
Poor baby, he loves children
I know what's going on in his heart
He's a mess inside
But he won't say anything since
his wif e can't get pregnant
His wif e has cut his tongue completely
Whatever she says it goes
Are you here Leyla?
Why don't you go and play?
Are you alright?
I have a headache
Why don't you go and lay down
on that blanket dear?
- With the others
- Yeah
Do you really think Reza is tolerating me?
I heard what you said
I'm bewildered
Reza has told me many times
he doesn't want babies
Listen Leyla
I raised Reza and I know him well
If he doesn't say anything
it's just for your sake
But deep down inside he loves children
So do I
Everyoe loves to have children
What can I do though?
There's lots you can do
I've done everything
But none of them worked
Well, that's fate
It's not your fault but
you can do a good deed
Like what?
You need to do something
What?
Be a good girl...
And let Reza have another wif e
What if Reza had the problem?
Would you have said the same thing?
No, I don't know...
I guess this is God's wll
But do something if you love Reza
It's getting late
She's a mother, maybe she's right
I don't have any children to know
how she is feeling
I don't know what to do
Just say yes, that's all
- Say yes?
- Yeah
Okay? Okay
God bless you my dear
I wish the best for you
- I hope you become the happiest person
- What's going on?
It's a good thing
Congratulations!
I hope your second wif e won't
have the problem I'm having
There's no way to tell
I'd never have married you
had I known I couldn't have babies
What are you saying?
Are you trying to test me?
Test you?
To find out how much I love you
It's not a test
I want you, your mother...
You'd have to have children
And a second marriage is the only way
Didn't you see how happy your mother was?
She shouldn't be
It's none of her business anyway
She got happy
What are you talking about?
What's this all about?
Are you really going to go through
Tolerating another woman in this house?
Have you lost your mind?
I hope you can understand how I feel
I understand you very well
I even understand how my mother feels
I understand how everyone feels
But why is it that nobody wants to
understand how I'm feeling?
How dare you and mother decide
about what I should do?
Shouldn't my opinion count as well?
Why do you let others
interf ere with our marriage?
What's it to them whether
I want children or not?
They keep telling you that you
can't have babies
But why are you getting upset?
I'm not
I'll throw a party
But you can have children
and shouldn't waste your lif e on me
Don't worry, I know what's good for me
I've told you many times bef ore
and I'll tell you again
I'm glad we don't have any children
- It's better this way
- No it's not
Fine, let's both commit
suicide and get it over with
This is not the way to do it
Do you know how much you've
been annoying me for?
Medications, doctors, tests
I do not want any children
And I don't want you this way neither
What happened to the old you?
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to see Hossein
- He can relate to me
- No
No one in my family knows about this
It will be horrible if they find out
Reza!
Don't go
I'll change to how I used to be
Are you happy?
Look
Like this...
So many children in the world
Why can't I have one of them?
Are you taking revenge?
Have I committed a sin?
Tell me
I'm stupid God, forgive me0
Right, he stood up to his family big time
He told them that it's nobody's business
and that they shouldn't interf ere in our lif e
Good for Reza, so he did stand up to them
Yeah, you should have seen his mother
She must have gotten really upset
You don't know how much better I am Golnaz
- Good!
- I feel like a load is off me
I feel like flying I'm so happy
- So lif e's sweet
- Yeah
I'm cooking Chinese food for his dinner now
- How I envy Reza
- He'll have a ball
But don't make him too fat
Who is it?
- Hi mother
- Hi
I'm so glad to see you
Too bad Reza isn't home
I know, I called his work
Come in, what a surprise
You never did this bef ore
I hadn't heard of you for a week
I was starting to miss you a lot
I thought it'd be nice
to stop by to see you
I'm glad you're here
- Here you are mother
- i'm tired
I know, let me take your Hijab
- Thanks
- Here you are
I'll be right with you
What are you up to dear?
Cooking Chinese food
Reza likes it a lot
You've forgotten all about yourself
since you love Reza so much
You don't think about yourself
Don't bother yourself Leyla
I've already eaten everything
I just came by to see you on my way home
We have guests tonight
How is father? The kids?
Everyone's fine
Would you and Reza like to come over too?
- It's the auntie
- Thanks a lot
We're going to my mother's house
We haven't seen them for a while
Are you making pickles?
Yes
I've made a lot of pickles this year
I'll bring some for you
Don't you bother yourself with anything
Thanks a lot mother
Thanks dear
I've been meaning to give
you this for a long time now
But I didn't find the chance
I was taking out my watch
out of the drawer today...
And I remembered this
My mother-in-law gave it to me
at my wedding
So I figured it should be given to you
Everything goes to boys
Boys mean everything to parents
Boys are the cream of the crop
Specially to me since I only have one boy
God gave me four girls and a boy
I wish them all the best
Everyone has a diff erent fate
Yes
Thanks
How pretty mother!
You really shouldn't have!
I never expected it
You don't expect anything from anybody
You are not a materialistic person Leyla
Why don't you put it on then?
It looks good on you
Reza had told me how much you love pearls
In the old days they used to say
pearls didn't suit everybody
They look good on some
and not so well on others
It's always looked good on me though
That's why you brought them for me
You must think I don't like you, right?
Only if you knew how much I've prayed for you
In order for you to get pregnant
All those nights I didn't sleep
I cried
I prayed for you
What diff erence does it make?
You're just like my own daughter
I have nothing against you Leyla
But you're mistaking
You're young now
What about when you grow as old as I am?
Reza will marry someone else eventually
Reza loves children
He's told me many times...
He's asked me to pray for him
when I go to Mashad...
To pray so...
And God might feel sorry for us
and give us a child
But he doesn't tell you any of that
He knows it makes you sad
Last year when Auntie Shamsi
went to Syria...
Last year when Auntie Shamsi
went to Syria...
Reza told her to pray for him too
Just so he could have a child...
He also wanted to go to Zeinab's holy shrine
What can he do though?
He can't announce it in the media
that he wants to have a baby
Just so you believe him?
Leyla, listen to me
I want what's best for you
Be a good girl...
And let us find a wif e for Reza
Later on when you grow old...
You'll suddenly realize...
That Reza has gotten married behind your back
But then you'll be old and embarrassed
You'd have to hide yourself...
From the neighbors then
You don't know how men are
They can go through with everything
To get what they desire
Specially when it comes to having a child
This is not a joke
Specially in our family with just one son
Leyla, if I had another son...
I wouldn't be begging you so much
Don't cry mother please
You get Reza to accept it
I have no objections
But it's no use if I get him to accept it...
But you complain to him from the other end
I haven't said anything
Well when men love someone...
Even if that someone can't have a baby...
They love her no matter what
It's obvious
It's obvious Reza is in love with you
Is there anyone who doesn't know it?
Okay mother
Whatever you think is the best
I have no objections
God bless you dear
I hope you get whatever you want in lif e
I hope all your wishes come true
I wish you happiness Leyla
What's that on your neck?
Mother gave it to me
Was she here?
Did she brain wash you again?
She says you want a child badly
but you're too shy to say so
I guess you've told Auntie Shamsi
a couple of times as well
You've told her to pray for you to have a baby
But this goes back to the time you
were going through all sorts of medication...
I can't believe how mother takes
advantage of the things I say
You can't fight the destiny Reza
I want to hear you say it too
Say it, say you want a baby too
Is that you Reza?
Were you sleeping?
Did I wake you up?
No turn on the light
I didn't want to ruin your sleep
How are you?
Were you at mother's house?
No, it's impossible to talk to her
I was over at your brother's house
- How was Mehri?
- Not bad
But the kids didn't let
us have a few words together
They were either crying
or fighting or having stomach aches
And they kept calling their mother
What they meant was that no one
should talk...
Or do anything else
Just sit and watch us
Don't talk of children anymore please Reza
I swear to God it's not like mother told you
During the heat of the moment
of medical examinations
And all that medications and tests
And all other things...
I was stupid to say one word
I told her to pray for us
And only for your sake
Just so you'd be comf ortable
Why can't you understand it?
Why do you insist on me marrying again?
What do I need another wif e for?
The first time was by force too!
My mother kept persisting about
our generation not becoming extinct
But so what?
What have we done for our people anyway?
So many people
One less won't hurt
What diff erence would it make?
I feel you're growing cold Leyla
You're becoming distant
You no longer love me
What have I done to you?
Nothing
But I can't go through it anymore
Our lif e's been revolving around the baby
issue for the past couple of months
So many medications, so much worry
I'm tired anymore Reza
I have no energy left
Well this is a kind of a medication
What do you mean?
I keep telling myself...
If Reza loves me...
He shouldn't care about another woman
She'll only give him a child
Nothing would change
And that our love will keep on existing
Why are you putting all the
responsibility on my shoulders?
What about you?
Me? I'm here
I'll be careful
I'll stay with you
I'm giving my consent
And I'll go through it
- Hello?
- Leyla!
- Hello mother
- Hi
How are you?
- How are you dear?
- Thanks for asking
- How is father?
- Not too bad
Did you talk to Reza dear?
Hello?
- Leyla!
- Yes?
- Did you talk to him Leyla?
- Yes
Will he do it?
I'll make him
So should I start looking for a girl?
Yes
I have one in mind as a matter of fact
I'll make the arrangements for this week
My sister knows a lot of girls
There is a colonel in her neighborhood
He has a nice daughter
who has a high school diploma
They are a nice family
She's not very pretty...
But, she's not a bad girl
I'll talk to my sister and set a date
- Okay dear?
- Sure
Is there anything else?
Bye mother
Bye
Mother called today
She said your Auntie Shamsi has
f ound a nice girl for you
For marriage
She's the daughter of a colonel
What? She is a colonel?
No, her father is a colonel
I guess she's not too bad looking neither
She's not pretty but...
What if she's too old?
I'm certain she's got dentures
And she's got rubber eyes too
And she's probably bald
With gold teeth
Only four on each side
She's probably got iron arms and legs
and she tightens the screws every night
Mother called two days later
And she set up a date for Thursday afternoon
Close to Auntie Shamsi's house
In Mirdamad St., near Mohseni Sq.
Asef St., number 15
Thursday afternoon I helped
Reza get ready myself
As if I was sending my kid to school
I chose his outfit
His shoes, his shirt
He looked nice and shiny
He asked me how he looked
I told him he looked quite handsome
And that the girl would certainly
f all in love with him
What? Why are you laughing?
How pure and innocent my husband's gotten
Just like a sweet and shy little kid...
He's going to propose to a girl
Wicked!
It's very stupid, isn't it?
I can't believe you've gotten me to do this
Is this it?
Next street
I'll hang around here for an hour
I'll do some shopping till you come
You will come, won't you?
Everyone's after something
But nobody can even guess what I'm doing here
Who can believe that I'm here...
Till my husband gets back from
asking a girl's hand?
Well, congratulations
You should have been there Leyla
It was a lot of laugh
She's six feet tall
With a bad attitude and old
And she kept chewing on her nails
- Was she scared?
- I couldn't tell you
Besides she has a slight nervous tick like this
- Stupid!
- I swear to God
And then her father started to talk and...
And asked me about my job
And how lif e is hard and expensive nowadays
Next the girl asked me
Whether I've ever been abroad
I told her that I have
She asked where and
I said Italy, France, America...
She asked which one did I like most?
I told her
That Iran is the best place to live
But she suddenly frowned
But it was obvious they are a rich family
About a kilo of gold was hanging from them
I wish you could have seen Auntie Shamis
That's enough
Why don't you make your usual
tasteless sauce tonight...
To go with the grilled chicken?
You know the one you mix them all up
- Yoghurt,...
- Sure, keep it up
- Hello?
- Hi, how are you?
Hello mother
Look, Auntie Shamsi told me all about it
You want a baby...
So what do you care about her appearance?
Besides you should thank God for
giving you a second wif e with so much gold
It'll be great for the future of your kid
What do you mean mother?
What does gold have to do with a baby?
What are you talking about mother?
Okay, don't worry
- I'll find another girlk
- Okay, take it easy now
I have to go for now, bye
Reza had gotten super kind for the
next couple of days and nights
He was trying to be too kind to me...
Just so I don't forget he loves me
And he kept on buying gifts for me
- Leyla dear, Auntie Shamsi found a girl
- Yes
The daughter of the retired director
general of the Ministry of Agriculture
She is thirty two years old
She's been married once...
But got seperated after a year
I guess her husband couldn't get her pregnant
- Sure
- Leyla dear...
I'm sure this one is suitable for Reza
- Yes dear
- Sure
We'll set a date for next week...
And so we were off the next afternoon
And like the last time Reza
wanted me to be with him
As if he was going to take an exam
He didn't want me to be home alone
And to annoy myself
But I guess I was getting used to it
Strange that I'm not scared
I can even imagine them all sitting around
What does she look like?
No
No, I'll go crazy like this
I should look at these
There he comes
I missed him a lot
So?
It was great
- Just great
- Really?
She's got a normal height
Very quiet and the type
who is always keeping to herself
Then she told me about her marriage
She was in love with her husband
But she divorced him since
he couldn't get her pregnant
And no matter how much the man begged...
It was useless
That was when
Auntie Shamsi started to sweet-talk
She told her that she did well by divorcing him
And that lif e is hell without kids
And other bullshit and I was starting
to get bored out of my mind
I mean come on, I have a wif e
and I'm in love with her
And I seem to want her more by the day
So what do I need another wif e for?
- Hi
- Hi
Well well, to what do I owe this pleasure to?
- Reza and Leyla here!
- We've been so busy
Yes I know...
You've been elected as
Africa's prime minister...
And that's why you've been so busy
Come in, here's your girl
- Hi, I missed you all a lot
- What a surprise!
My sweetheart
- Hi mother, how are you?
- Hi
Come in, come
Tell me how it went
- It didn't go
- Why not?
I guess the girl divorced her husband
f or not being able to get her pregnant
And no matter how much the poor
soul begged her but it was useless
It seems she is very ruthless
- And?
- And Reza didn't accept it
You don't know how painful it is though Nazgol
I'm on pins and needles all the time
I don't know, but deep in my heart...
There's a wound or a pain somewhere
And it's burning me up
Why don't you do something then?
What can I do?
What do you mean?
You can do lots
You can stand your ground and say no
You can say you won't let it happen
Besides, Reza too keeps saying
that he doesn't want another wif e
His mother forced him, so?
What are you two mumbling about?
Tell us about it too
Or is it about lovie-dovie stuff?
Is it another girl?
There goes the uncle again
No uncle, Nazgol is careful
But once love comes along...
You'll get down on your knees
no matter who you are
So much for the uncle
He sticks his nose into everything
Nazgol dear, where is Leyla?
Where were you sweetie?
I was starting to miss you a lot
How are you?
- How is Reza?
- Fine
I always tell Hossein to
stop by your house
- But he never moves
- Why didn't you come by yourself?
- How is Reza's father?
- He's fine too
- His mother, what about his sisters?
- They're all just fine
Doesn't Reza's little sister
want to get married yet?
I don't know
Why are you standing there Leyla?
Have a seat
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks
- What's this?
- For the kids
Do you have to work for them
even when you're at a gathering?
Where are you two going?
Go after them Alireza
Or do I have to do this too?
I got stupid once already
But it won't happen to me again
Besides I'm way ahead of you all
when it comes to that
Am I wrong?
There are lots of girls who'd love to marry me
But I won't give in to marriage so easily
I have my conditions
She must have a house, a car
And she'll have to fill my pockets
up with money every month
Without me knowing it
On top of that, she must be young
pretty and educated too
She shouldn't talk too much
That's right
But such a woman must be super
stupid to become your wif e uncle!
What's wrong with stupidity?
It's better than the brain you have Nazgol
You and your fiance
You slime!
You have nowhere to escape this time Nazgol
- It's all over with
- Where are you going? Come in
Where are you Leyla?
You seem down
I'm a little tired
What do you want me to play for you?
This is just fine
But mother wasn't going to give up
Three weeks later she found another girl
She is thirty years old
Her parents are both teachers
And they work for the Ministry of Education
Her parents were decent people
But the girl...
She was one of those shameless girls...
You should have seen her
Her father began to talk and
Asked me about my job
I told him that me and my dad
have an engineering company
And that we have a decent income
Then the girl said
'' How has your wif e allowed
you to have a second wif e?''
Well?
And all I could do was to stare
at her like an idiot
So she had to answer her own question
What did she say?
She said,
'' Right, she can't get pregnant ''
Then she said that having children
without love in lif e would be meaningless
And that how could you be in love
with two people at the same time
And she told me to divorce you and marry her
- Just like that?
- Yeah
So?
I told her that you'd have to like
her for the starters
And that it'd be impossible
if you didn't like her
And that was when she got all quiet
Then her mother said...
'' So your wif e makes the choice? ''
What else did they say?
I told her that I was in love with you
And how great you are
And the only thing is that
you can't get pregnant
The the girl said
'' Come back whenever you divorce your wif e ''
I told her sure, but don't hold your breath
That night we went to the
Japanese Restaurant again
It's just like engagement perios
It was great
We laughed so much while
the food was being cooked
It was as if we had just met
Our house, our marriage...
They all had a diff erent feeling
I kept telling myself...
That this baby issue isn't so bad
I just realized how I can love someone
Now I understand that love is
just like a living thing...
And it can grow
Where were you?
I called a hundred times
Yes we went out for dinner last night
We got home late
Where is Reza?
Why didn't he go to work?
Reza was tired and stayed home to sleep
With all the things he does
it's no wonder he's tired
Why does he bother us so much?
His Auntie Shamsi is trying so hard
To find the right girls
She keeps at it
But he comes along and rejects the girl
- Have you told him anything?
- No mother
My girls are all so naive
I ask them if they know anyone
But they say no and that they don't
know anyone who has a daughter
It's obvious they don't approve
of their brother remarrying
They don't even call to ask...
How it goes
I have to call them myself
And tell them about Reza's dilemma
Hello? Leyla?
- Are you still there?
- Yes
For the love of God...
Tell me if you've said something
to Reza to discourage him
I swear to God no
Reza isn't discouraged
You find a good girl, and sure
What was wrong with the ones
we've found till now?
Okay I'll let you know
- Bye
- Bye
- Who was it? My mother?
- Yeah
I wish I hadn't woken up at all
To hear that bullshit again
sleeping is great
I'd go nuts if it weren't because of sleeping
Let's run away and go somewhere else
Somewhere that nobody knows us
And we can have a comf ortable lif e
This is all my fault
What do you mean?
I wish you'd be standing up to me
instead of going through with all this
I wish you'd tell me that
you didn't want me to remarry
Why won't anyone understand that
I don't need any children
I like my lif e just the way it is
But my mother doesn't want
our family to become extinct...
And so I'd have to do...
Things I don't like at all
Eversince Auntie Shamsi started
the hunt for a girl...
Father's become very formal with me
I tried talking to him a couple of times
but he didn't give me a chance at all
I was talking to him a couple
of days ago in the car...
And I told him,
'' Why don't you talk to mother? ''
He said, '' I talked to your mother
the very first day ''
She wanted you to marry Auntie
Shamsi's daughter but you didn't...
And now she's taking revenge
There are many couples who can't have babies...
But they kept on living their lif e
You tell me that you love your wif e
a lot and that...
You're quite content with your marriage
But at the same time you go to various
girls' house to evaluate them for marriage
You should be ashamed of yourself!
What sin has your poor wif e committed?
Do you remember what Leyla
told your mother the first day?
She said that what if it were
Reza who couldn't have children?
Would you have done the same thing?
Tell me, what if you couldn't have a baby?
What if Leyla wanted to divorce
you to marry another man?
What would you do then?
But I never said I wanted to divorce her
This is a kind of a divorce
You don't know what she's going through
I've heard you're upset and sad as well
Your mother keeps talking about you
That you're getting destroyed
Why don't you stand up to everyone
and tell them you don't want to do this?
What's all this then?
The problem is that Leyla is okay with this
No, you're the only one okay with this
Not Leyla for sure
Your mother and aunt keep saying
that you'll do it next year if not now
They say you'll eventually divorce her anyway
I never said I want to divorce her dad
Bye
I realized how much I've missed father
I wanted to cry
I tried to stop my tears
When Reza was talking...
I felt he was a sort of jealous of my patience
And that's what was bothering him the most
But he didn't want to let it show
Had I acted diff erently...
Perhaps Reza wouldn't be jealous at all
I know he loves me deep down
There aren't any women
who can go through what I've been
God didn't give me any children...
But instead he's given me lots of patience
Mother started to come
by after a few days again
And we set a date for a day
after tomorrow afternoon
You get Reza to go through somehow
Sure
Why don't you go with Reza to see for yourself
Everyone already hates me here as it is
Let alone if I try to go along
with him for the proposal
Do something for God's sake dear...
So Reza accepts this one
We'll both be out of this misery
I'd better go now
How are Aziz and the others?
Just fine, thanks
But they don't know anything about this
so remember not to say anything to them
Okay, I won't
Besides suppose they know...
They'll realize Reza is only doing this
to have a baby
They don't know I can't get pregnant
So they must think Reza has a problem
What a shame!
No mother, they think we don't want
to have any children
They think we don't want it now
Very well
Bye, I gotta go
- The cab is waiting
- Bye
There's someone head over hill in love with you
He's trying to tell you something...
But he doesn't know whether to say it or not
What?
He wants you to escape with him
to the mountains
To be rid of everyone here
Look, this is the mountain
This is the valley, and the escape route
You see?
Let's see what does yours say
There is a woman in your
lif e who loves you a lot
She wants you to have
every good think in the world
There's also another woman waiting for you
She's young
She'll make you happy
What is it?
Did mother call again?
She came by
She's found another girl
She's twenty four years old
She knows you won't divorce your wif e
She knows I can't get pregnant
The day after tomorrow at four
No, not anymore
I don't want to
Anyone who brings a child into this world...
Is only trying to hide his fraud
He has to be crazy and madly
in love with himself
To want to bring someone
else into this disaster
Why do you let others to
interf ere with your lif e?
Do you even know what you're doing?
I swear to God she doesn't know
She's way off
The day we went to the orphanage
I told Reza...
That I pref ered to raise his child
And he said that anyone who was
going to be his wif e...
Would have to accept his first wif e
What do you mean?
She might consent verbally...
But it's impossible literary
Another woman in your house?
Who's supposed to have a baby?
What if he falls in love with her?
What would happen to you?
Well that's why I say this is all a test
If Reza's love is for real...
What Reza?
What about you?
I've heard you even intend to raise
the baby too, is that right?
What about the mother of the baby?
What if she didn't let you?
Show me a kind second wif e
You'd be a step-mother
Don't you get it?
Have you forgotten Esmat, the wif e of Jalil?
As soon as he married another woman...
She was forced to leave with two kids
No it's diff erent
- The woman Reza is choosing...
- Is Reza choosing?
Who the hell is Reza?[
He's just a man like all others are
Do you any man who doesn't like to
have a second wif e?
Specially when a baby comes a long too
And that's when the love for the baby's
mother grows extremely
I don't know
But I do know that I'm tired anymore
Suppose I say no to tomorrow
What about two years later?
Mother isn't and won't be giving up ever
Weren't you the one who said...
That once mother decides on something
there's no stopping her?
And that she's got a will of steal?
Frankly I can't tolerate mother's
stares anymore
And I don't want to be walking
on egg shells all the time
Whatever she wants
I give up
I feel this time is diff erent
I feel everything will be clear this time
And that I'll be out of this uncertainty
What will happen?
Do you think everything will
go on nice and quietly?
You idiot, get reay
And be strong
Don't be afraid
Don't shake
Well, how did it go?
I guess this one wasn't so bad
Why do you say that?
You've become very serious
What can I say?
I'm embarrassed
Oh dear, are you now?
Are you embarrassed because
you've accepted this one?
Have you?
I don't know
I really don't
Congratulations
Tell me about it
Nothing, her husband's dead
Norman middle-class
Very shy
I told her that I have a wif e
and that she'd have to approve as well
Her mother agreed
She said that she wouldn't allow it to
happen unless you were okay by it
Frankly I really liked what her mother said
So left is for me to see her and approve
I guess so
I can't believe this
Unbelievable
Yes?
- Hi Leyla, how are you?
- Hi auntie
I'm fine, thanks
So how did it go sweetie?
Did he approve of her?
Yes, he did
Thank God then
- Put Reza on the phone then
- Sure
- Hi auntie
- Hi dear
- Did you like her?
- Yes
- I'll set the date for two days later at six
- Okay
Her mother will be coming too
You know it's tradition
Okay, bye
The girl is coming at six in two days
f or you to meet her
Her mother is coming as well
Listen Leyla, should you not like her...
You'd have to tell me for sure
Because if you don't...
There's no way I'll accept it
What's wrong?
You look like a statue?
Listen Leyla, you are forcing
me to go through with this
But if you back out later and
don't want to go on...
And if you leave me...
I'll be devastated
Think it through
There's still time
It's beyond that anymore
Let's go out, I feel like I'm choking
- Hi
- Hi
- Well my Leyla
- Hi uncle
Hi uncle, how are you?
Glad to see you
Long time no see
I'm glad you're here
I want you to meet her too
- Who are you talking about?
- Amir, a friend of Amir and Hossein
Who is Amir?
He's the one who caused
you and Reza to get introduced
He's coming over tonight
Why?
He wants to ask for Nazgol's hand
Congratulations
- Hi Leyla, how are you?
- Hi
- How are you?
- How are you Mehri?
- Hi auntie
- Hi
Welcome
I'll be right with you
What's wrong sweetie?
Is something going on?
It's nothing Aziz
It's my pressure
I'll be fine in a minute
But why? What's wrong?
I'll be fine
- Hello Mr. Groom, how are you?
- Hi, how are you?
How are you?
Amir is here
The groom is walking right
in the trap, come in
Hello, how are you?
- Welcome
- Hi ma'am
Come in please
Very kind of you
Everyone keeps telling you not to get stupid
You're just starting your lif e
Why are you trying to put yourself
in a lot of trouble?
- What can I say uncle?
- This girl's putting us through hell
Nazgol will skin you alive
I'm telling you
The uncle is trying to bargain
No, living expenses are very high nowadays
And the uncle is raising up the ante
This is useless anymore
- You'll become stupid
- Yes
But I want you to learn from your dear friend
He's fifteen years overdue to get married...
But he still won't be trapped
Where is Leyla?
Leyla!
Leyla!
Leyla!
Did you vomit again dear?
- What is it?
- It might be due to pregnancy
I don't know
What if she is pregnant?
- My pressure's dropped
- What's wrong again?
It's her blood pressure uncle
Her pressure?
Where did it drop to?
Why doesn't this ever happen to us?
Let's eat dinner at least
Are you alright?
Did you stop vomitting?
No
What about your headache?
It's better
Is this egg broiled?
It's for you
You eat it, I'm not hungry
I'll pass by in five minutes
I really hope you won't like her though
There's no way I'll accept
if you don't like her
Tell Auntie Shamsi not to say anything
to me when she sees me
Why am I standing here?
To see whether I'll approve of my
husband's new wif e?
Who'll believe it?
I'm not made of steal
What if I burst of sorrow?
God...
I felt a strange calmness by seeing her
I think I liked her a sort of
She had a calm and pure face
As if she no longer was my rival
I don't know why...
But I wasn't my usual self anymore
I'd gotten strong
I no longer was scared of Reza
being taken from me
- The green one
- Sure
- Is this it?
- Yes please
Well, did you like her Leyla?
Leyla dear!
- Do you approve of her?
- Yes
She seemed to be a good and innocent girlk
I sure hope she'll be good for Reza
Thank God
Well?
Tell me how it went
Both families are supposed to
have a gathering this week
So the bride and groom can get
to know each other better
Anyway, it seems everything's
coming to an end nice and clean
- Listen Leyla...
- This is '' Shah Maqsoud ''
I bought it for you
Thanks
I can never understand women
They do anything they want to
I truly don't know what to do
Why don't you water the flowers pal?
- Bye Leyla
- Bye
Well, did you get a good look at her Leyla?
- Do you approve?
- Yes
My God
Why are you standing?
Sit down dear
Sit
Don't be sad
This is my destiny
What is it Homeira?
What is it?
What are you doing?
Get out of here, now
This one and this one please
And so we went to buy the ring
f or the bride starting tomorrow
Since Reza's sisters wouldn't go with him
This is sapphire but there's
a lot of gold on it as well
- How is this one?
- It's fine
- Put this one on
- What for?
I want to buy it for you
I don't want you to
Thanks
- Are you sure?
- Yeah
How much is this one?
Neither of us approved of it
But mother is very sad
And Firouzeh thinks of the future
The wedding is in a couple of days
Should we go?
Should we not go?
So we want to ask for your advice
Of course Parvin
Why not?
Both of you should go
That poor girl is innocent here
You should even be present at
her wedding ceremony too
Everything must go on nicely
How are you?
You're back so soon
I missed you, I didn't even have lunch...
So I came earlier to have dinner together
I got this for you
Listen to it and see if you like it
What's wrong?
I don't feel too well
I'm not in the mood for this shotgun wedding
Did you go to Giti's house?
Yes, with mother and Auntie Shamsi
We stayed there for an hour
Then I showed them the ring
I told them you chose it
- You shouldn't have
- Why not?
They complimented you a lot
And then Homa and Firouzeh went
to buy the wedding dress
The same place you recommended
Giti's mother invited everyone
to her house for dinner
Dad called to see how you were doing
He was trying to make sure
you won't be left alone tomorrow night
He told me to take you there
Reza!
Reza is here, get ready
Why are you so late Reza?
I got stuck in traffic
- You should have left sooner then
- We're here anyway
But it'll cause embarrassment for us
- What are you doing here Leyla?
- Hello father
Let's go out, the weather is nicer out there
Let's go for a walk, why here?
Don't stall
Homeira, this is too heavy
- Change your Hijab then
- It's fine mother, we're running late
It's very late Reza, run
Too bad you're not coming
Just what I said
Tell them she was sick and couldn't come
I hope they don't take it personally
They won't, take care
I'm surprised mother didn't even
ask me once how I was doing
Doesn't she know what I'm going through?
Can't she put herself in my
shoes for even a moment?
How selfish can she be?
- Drink your tea please
- Thanks a lot
I'm glad you came here Leyla dear
I'm glad you're not home alone
Have faith in God
Try to have faith in God in times like now
Until Tuesday and the night
of the wedding...
I started to clean the house
I felt I had to clean everything
I wanted everything to shine
Reza came home at noon
He was excited and restless
I cooked him some chicken kebab
But I had no apetite to eat
Neither did Reza but I insisted
and he ate some anyway
He went to take a nap after lunch
He was supposed to go to the hair stylist
and take a sauna afterwards
And to get ready for the wedding
He returned in the evening
He was red and shiny
I had his suit ready on the bed
Don't stay home all alone for God's sake
Go to your mother's house
No
I'll stay
I'll wait for you
I prepared the guest house for myself
the last day
I was all numb because of so much pain
I thought that was it
I brought it upon myself
I thought no one was supposed to come
Who are these people though?
- It's tradition dear
- What tradition? Nobody was supposed to come
It's alright dear, don't worry
We'll be here for ten minutes
The poor bride has done nothing wrong
Congratulations
Excuse me
I sure hope you won't frown at me tonight Reza
- Take some fruit and other things
- Thanks
You attend to the fruits Shokouh
- Where are the herbs?
- Here you are
- Now light it up
- What should I do?
You take care of the tea Goli
Bring the tea cups from there
Leyla!
Leyla!
Open the door, Leyla
I couldn't stop them
I'm sorry
Go on Reza, go
Giti, I wish you happiness dear
Bye dear
Bye dear, thanks
Take care
Aziz!
What have I done to be torturing like this?
Why couldn't I have a baby?
Why didn't you tell me?
Why did Reza do this to you?
Reza didn't want to, I forced him
But why?
Leyla, I had to tell them
I'm coming
Is Leyla here?
Hi
Hi
Do you hate me so much?
You planned to get rid of me like this, right?
Good God
I swear to God she forced me to do it
She wanted to make my mother happy
I wasn't important to her
I swear we were happy
We didn't need any children
We had everything
Everybody can testify to that
She didn't approve of a baby from the orphanage
She said that she wanted it
to be my own child
Didn't you want a child as well?
Yes I did Nazgol
But her child and not anyone else's
Do you really expect Leyla
to stay in that house...
And to live with your new wif e?
That's what she said herself
She said she wanted to raise my child
Why didn't you come to talk to us pal?
I tried to talk to Hossein many times...
But she wouldn't let me
She didn't want any of you to find out
That you'd all get sad if you knew
Hossein, don't make so much noise
We're fed up
What do you want now?
What are you saying?
Leyla must keep her promise
She married me and she'll leave
my house only when she dies
I'll get Giti a house to live in
Leyla can come back to her house
Why did you go along with it
if you didn't want any children?
- That's exactly what I'm...
- Why don't you divorce your new wif e?
I will, if Leyla wants me to
Nothing's happened yet
I left the house when Leyla left last night
I walked all night
For God's sake Aziz
Do something!
For the love of God
Uncle!
Talk to her yourself
Leyla!
What are you trying to take out on me Leyla?
What have I done to you?
Why don't you answer me?
Don't be so stubborn Leyla
You know damned well I did all this for you
You wanted it, isn't that so?
Get up Leyla
Come back home
I promise to put her up in a diff erent house...
In a couple of days
Or I'll divorce her if you want me to
Get up Leyla
For God's sake get up
I'd never seen Reza so helpless
and disappointed bef ore
The way he was begging
But I'd turned into stone
Although I still loved him but...
It was like someone dear who had died
I couldn't step in that house anymore
Reza called a couple of times
and said the same things
Then his sisters came to see me
You've truly destroyed Reza
All he ever does is to fight with mother
He says that mother's ruined his
happiness all for her selfish reasons
Father keeps arguing with mother as well
He says that you can't be blamed
He tells mother that she ruined everyone
The newly bride keeps complaining
That Reza doesn't pay the least of
attention to her
I couldn't talk anymore
I had nothing to say
Everything was over
A week later Reza took his
new wif e to a new house
And she got pregnant after two months
Mother was so happy
she couldn't contain herself
And she delivered the baby after nine months
A baby girl named Baran
Mother got sad all over again
It hadn't made any diff erences for Reza
The girl had told Parvin...
That Reza wanted her for Leyla
And now that Leyla isn't here
I don't exist neither
At first I thought love could
come between us again
But it didn't
Then I told myself that the baby...
Might be able to save two people's lives
But now the baby is born...
I'm prepared to get seperated from Reza
And instead perhaps Reza might think...
That by stabilizing my lif e...
He could clear his conscious
Reza accepted it
And he'll divorce her gladly
And he'll pay her the dowry,
and give her the apartment in full
The girl has money now...
And after a few months
She marries her cousin who
has been wanting to marry her
And Baran stays with mother
I'm tired
I'm very lonely
Reza stopped by to see me a couple of times
He talked, and begged
He told me how miserable and how lonely he is
And how every corner of
the house still smells like me
And how my things are intact
And how ruthless I am
And how selfish I am
But it was all useless
I couldn't stop my silence fasting
A better lif e with less children
A shorter lif e with more children
Reza was alone with that big house
He didn't divorce me
Neither did he marry another woman
But he was hopeful deep down inside
He'd told his older sister that
This year on the twenty eighth of the month
of Saf ar when they cook '' Sholeh Zard ''...
He was going to bring some to our
house just like he did a few years ago
To be able to persuade me
To go back with him in that house
Take it
Let me fill up Auntie Shamsi's plate too
But '' Sholeh Zard '' was much better this time
Platters are here
Hi Reza, how are you?
Long time no see
Hi Hossein, good to see you too
- How are things?
- Not too bad, thanks
- How are you?
- How are you little one?
How are you dear?
Did you say hello to Uncle Hossein?
The guys are all inside
Let's go in
- How is everything?
- Not too bad
Perhaps when I tell this story
to Baran, Reza's daughter, someday...
She will laugh
If it weren't for mother's persistancy...
She'd never be in this world
'' THE END ''
