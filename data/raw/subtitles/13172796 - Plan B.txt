MOTHER: While I’m at the real estate
convention this weekend,
I want you to finish your PSAT test book.
‐ Oh, Ma, do you think we can skip
the coconut oil this morning?
‐ It's a tradition.
Are you too good for tradition?
FATHER: Lupe, we talked about this.
Your outfit, your hair...
I mean, every day,
it gets more and more ridiculous.
‐ Oh, Jesus wore dresses
and nobody judged him, right?
‐ Everybody judged him,
they crucified him.
‐ Your online grade book says
you received a 96.
‐ What happened?
‐ It was just one question
about Judge Danforth.
It was a dumb mistake.
‐ There are no smart mistakes, Sunny.
One little mistake can ruin
the rest of your life.

‐ Fuck!

‐ Oh, man!
Thank you.
My dad was in full form this morning.
Someone needs to seriously
depucker his asshole.
‐ How is Logan?
‐ Oh, real good.
Look at all the squirt emojis
my butt caused.
‐ Ah, at least you're wearing
underwear this time.
LUPE: Sunny, when you start dating,
you'll see,
you gotta keep 'em hooked,
gotta use what God gave you.
SUNNY: [scoffs] What exactly
do you think God gave me,
except a nightguard
and an overbearing mother?
LUPE: Sunny, you can't be
embarrassed about this stuff.
[bell ringing]
GIRL: Is Jason bringing the keg tonight?
‐ Yeah. Oh, did I tell you?
We finally tried reverse cowgirl.
‐ And? How was it?
Amazing, right?
‐ Yeah. I mean, it wasn't...
that great for me,
but I feel like it looked cool.
My butthole's not my best feature...
‐ Girls are horse fucking and
I haven't even had my first kiss.
I'm so behind.

I can't imagine what else is overgrown.
‐ Eww! Oh my God.
Glad you spent your free time thinking
about what my pussy looks like, Megan.
‐ Oh my God, I don't.
Obviously. I don't.
‐ That was so funny.
She was really embarrassed.
Listen, obviously boys like
your "au naturel" look.
Meanwhile, the underwear my mom buys me
renders me invisible.
Take a look. It's like sexual camouflage.
‐ Oh, that's your underwear?
Thought you just shaved
your nipples and pubes off.
Our slumber party is gonna be bomb.
We're gonna do face masks and binge

I just creamed my pants.

He's like...
He's like an athletic librarian.
LUPE: I totally do not understand
the attraction.
I mean, he's, like, cute, but he's got
major guidance counselor vibes.
‐ Yeah.
LUPE: Well, maybe you should
invite him over
for a little
"Disney+ and Thrust," huh?
He can bang you doggy style
while you watch Lady and the Tramp.
‐ How would we do the pasta thing
if he's behind me?
[laughs]
‐ Also, you know I want

‐ Yeah, my mom doesn't let me go there.
She's weirded out

My church's youth group is throwing
a talent show next week,

You should come. My church is awesome.

Basically, what's happening right now

When you finally take that first drive,
you're gonna want it

that doesn't like count, right?
‐ What if I want to drive my car alone,
you know, just to make sure
that the oil still works?
‐ Okay, okay, does anybody
have a real question?
‐ Yes, Hunter.
HUNTER: It's a real question.
So, how does giving a passenger "a ride"
actually make a difference
in how a car drives?
‐ Oh, well, just because the guy can tell
if the...
upholstery was ripped
by the other passengers,
so then the car can never get back
that "new car feeling" again.
‐ Yeah?
‐ You can't tear the upholstery.
That's a myth.
It just stretches and then it goes...
HUNTER: [whispering] Who is that?
‐ ...back into place.
[girl giggles]
‐ Yeah. Yeah, okay, okay.
So why does this groom
care so much about this car
when he doesn't even have one,
'cause now he is just some bum
who is ragging on his wife
about her car?
‐ Right, so weird.
Why would he do that? What?
TEACHER: He has his car.
It's just, in the video, we're just
looking at his‐‐ at her car, okay?
‐ Then why aren't we seeing
his car being inspected?
Why is there no "his car" inspection?
‐ We don't know where his car is.
‐ I prefer to take public transportation
because it helps with the environment.

How are ya?
‐ You're so beautiful.
‐ Excuse me?
‐ Looks like we got a couple hot tamales!
‐ Oh‐ho‐ho, girl, I get it.

Hey, gimme some sugar, sugar!
‐ How you doin', sir?
‐ Thank you for your service.
‐ Excuse me.
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi, uh, Doris.
‐ That's right.
‐ I was wondering if you could help me
get back onto the highway.
We're headed toward Rapid City.
‐ Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
You're gonna go right out
to that road you were on
and you're gonna keep on driving till you
get to Neil Larson's corn farm.
‐ Neil Larson's corn farm?
‐ Mm‐hmm.
Ah, you don't know Neil?
‐ No.
‐ He's the only person around here
who grows dent corn
instead of sweet corn.
[laughs]
Crazy.
‐ Yeah. So...
‐ You're gonna start countin'.
You're gonna give yourself
a one‐Mississippi, two‐Mississippi...
You'll go to 20‐Mississippi and then
you'll take a right at the doll museum.
‐ Uh, are there any street names?
‐ Hmm...
You know, probably.
So then you're gonna come to a rock...
But not just any rock...
[phone buzzing]
Fist Rock.
And then things get a tiny bit strange.
There's a few houses
with bullet holes in 'em.
You'll go six more Mississippis,
and you will be on the highway.
‐ Okay. Think I got that.
‐ Yeah, you're welcome.
‐ Thank you.
‐ And if you guys got some time...
I don't know what you got
and what you don't got...
but if you got some time,
get up in that doll museum.
You are gonna love it.
It's beautiful, I got married there.
‐ Oh.
‐ Congratulations.
‐ Yeah, well, "congrats"
is not quite the word.
LUPE: Oh.
‐ Hmm‐mm.
BOTH: Sorry.
‐ Something happened.
SUNNY: What happened?
‐ You wanna guess?
‐ Uh, it was an amicable split?
‐ No. Way worse. You wanna guess?
‐ I don't really want to.
‐ No.
‐ He did that thing from Footloose,
where he had one...
one foot in each car window
and he was sort of surfing,
but, you know,
one started going faster
and veering a little to the right
and one started veering
a tiny bit to the left,
and he just split right in half,
right up the seam of his balls,
and just right up the middle of his face.
And just, the right half of him
was on one side,
the left half of him was on the other.
So we weren't married very long,
but we had a beautiful wedding
amongst those shorthaired dolls.
‐ How much for the food?
‐ You know what? I like you two.
Let's call it $2.67.
‐ Look what I got.

a couple of... couple of beers,
just waiting for you to come back.
‐ Why don't you just fuck off, okay?
‐ Okay. We have a little live one here.
‐ Hey, Bill, I got a question.
You think these two Mexicans
got spicy tacos?
‐ What are you talking about, our vaginas?
BILL: Yeah.
‐ I'd like to put my burrito in that taco.
With a side of beans
if you know what I mean.
‐ I'm South Asian, so like that metaphor
doesn't track, actually.
‐ What's the equivalent of your taco?
‐ Rotis, or like naan or something.
‐ They're fucking idiots,
so they won't even get it.
‐ Why don't you show us?
‐ I don't think so.
‐ Please leave.
‐ If you take one step closer,
I'll pee on you.
Seriously, I'll pee on you, dude.
Okay, I saw a TED Talk that says
that peeing discourages sexual assault,
so I intend on peeing on you,
and I don't miss, bucko.
‐ You can't even do it.
‐ All right, Sunny, start peeing. Do it.

It's marijuana.
‐ A little weedsie‐deedsie?
You know, I will trade you
a few hits off of that... [clears throat]

‐ You stole these?
‐ They were really overpriced.
‐ Yeah, she took 'em.
That's why I came out with the bat.
‐ Oh.
‐ Oh my gosh.
‐ I'm so so sorry. I just...
‐ No, it's fine.
I feel like we'll be even stevens.
So the condom just fell out?
Hmm. I've been there.

So that's... what we're trying to do.
‐ We're headed to Planned Parenthood
in Rapid City, so...
‐ Well, I hate to tell you,
but they're probably closed for the night.
‐ Shit. Fuck.
My 24‐hour window is closing rapidly.
I'm down to like 61% efficacy
after 48 hours.
‐ You know, I wonder if my nephew Andy
could help you girls.
‐ Yeah?
‐ Oh. What?
‐ He gets me oxy at Canadian prices.
'Cause here it is, uh, too expensive,
and there's some doctors
who won't prescribe it.
Like mine.
‐ [mumbling] I think there's only
one hit left in that.
‐ I feel like there's a little more
so I'm gonna keep going on it.
Okay, you know how earlier I told you
to go down to the doll museum
and take that right?
You won't take that right,
you'll just keep counting.
Sixteen Mississippi.
And then you're gonna take a left instead.
And he is set up in the playground
next to the middle school.
‐ He's in... he's in the playground?
‐ Yeah, yeah, that's where his office is.
Because he is not allowed to do business
from his mom's house anymore.
[turn signal clicking]
SUNNY: I think we're here.
Oh, man.
Playgrounds go from fun to creepy
really quick at night.
ANDY: Yo, what do you want?

We're looking for Andy?
His Aunt Doris sent us here.
‐ Oh, Auntie D?
Yeah! Okay, if she says you're cool.
We can do that b'ness.
Ow!

Welcome to the kingdom.
What can I get you fine females
this evening?
‐ We need the morning after pill.
‐ Oh, Levonorgestrel?
That shit has been flying off my shelves.
All these girls gettin' seeded up.
Like to put that yogurt right in the cup.
Check that shit out.
I got one more right here.
‐ Um, yeah. Okay, that could be anything.
‐ Nah, girl, it's the pill.
Or speed.
There's like a really small chance
it might be PCP.
No, it's the pill.
Shit, you got me scared.
It's one hundo.
‐ No. No.
‐ What?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not paying
for an unmarked pill
that's probably PCP, no.
‐ Really small chance it's PCP.
Suit yourself.
You want that labeled shit, I got you.
I got Premarin, I got Ritalin,
Next Level Latisse.
I got bad coke, I got ephedra.

then, I mean, maybe we can...
maybe we can use a fake ID.
‐ Yeah.
ANDY: Oh, here we go.
‐ Great.
‐ Oh, shit. Look at that.
It's like a doppelbanger.
‐ How much is it?
‐ Three hundo.
‐ That's steep.
Okay, um, how's...
how's 50 bucks and a weed vape?
‐ What? No.
‐ It's for the cause, dude,
I'll pay you back later.
‐ No, I don't fuck with vapes.
That shit'll kill you.
Four hundo.

But I also got...
this.

Thank you, thank God.
Okay, um, maybe we can look up

My mom is calling me. What do we do?

I ignore my dad's phone calls
and I just pretend to be the busy signal,

Do you want me to try it?
‐ No, how is that helpful? No!
‐ Well, she's also gonna know

And I don't think
that you have to feel guilt...
or shame.
I think that you did something that is
totally normal, totally human, and...
Ms. Flaucher, she might not agree.
But you know what,
I think that we both know
that our Sex Ed teacher has come
nowhere near having sex.

talk to you, I feel like this little girl
talking to a fully realized sexual being.
It gets tiring.
‐ I'm sorry.
I did have sex
with that guy from church camp.
But that was like once.
And I just felt like...
it was better to be thought of as a slut
than as like a lesbo or whatever.
So I just...
let people think what they wanted to...
and played into it.
‐ But I'm not "people."
‐ I know.
And I think I'm...
ready to stop caring
what people think anyway.
No more secrets?
‐ No more secrets. [giggles]
Um, I do have a question, though.
Can I call you Fruit Loop now
or is that like very offensive?
‐ You can absolutely call me Fruit Loop
and I will wear that name with pride.
‐ Yeah.
Kewl.
‐ Wait, did Kyle say
he put it in your rear end?
‐ No.
‐ No?
‐ I'm pretty sure I heard him say
it was in the rear end.
‐ It was‐‐
‐ That was...
Sunny, no secrets!
‐ It was more like the taint, if anything.

‐ Hi, Kyle.
KYLE: Hey, Sunny, I just...
wanted to apologize
for freaking out last night.
‐ That's okay.
I was pretty freaked out,
too, to be honest.
‐ You know, I realized something
this morning at church.
God forgives.
It's like the whole reason
Christianity exists.
He loves his children no matter what.
Even if they almost do butt sex.
I'm gonna hold onto that.
And I‐‐ I think we'll be okay.
‐ Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks.
‐ Take care, Sunny.
Oh, Sunny, I don't know
if I mentioned it before,
but my youth group
is doing a talent show next week...
‐ Okay, bye, Kyle!
[Spanish‐language TV program
playing softly]
‐ Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
‐ Guadalupe?
Oh, mija. Thank God you're okay.
I was so worried about you.
Thank you, God.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
‐ Oh, yeah, no, I'm...
I'm okay.
Thanks.
‐ What happened? Where were you?
‐ Uh, I just...
uh, had to help Sunny with something
really important,
and it just took
a lot longer than we thought, so...
‐ Why didn't you answer my calls?
‐ You called?
‐ At least 10 times.
There was this weird busy signal.
Lupe, you gotta get better at...
No, you know what? Whatever.
Look, I'm just glad you're okay.
Oh, mija, my mind went through
the worst‐case scenarios.
Just kept imagining you getting into
all kinds of crazy situations.
‐ Yeah, no... crazy situations for me.
‐ [chuckles] I gotta call your abuela,
tell her you're okay.
Okay, thank God, and don't
ever do this to me again, okay?
Gonna call your abuela.
‐ Hey, Dad?
‐ Yeah?
‐ Pr‐promise me you'll never, um,
kick me out.
‐ What? What do you mean?
Why would I do that?
‐ I‐I don't know.
I just, um, you know,
sometimes parents do that.
‐ Oh, mija.
You're my little loquita.
Okay, it's not my job to judge you.
It's my job to be your dad,
no matter what.
You can kill someone
and you will always have a home here.
I mean, I gotta call your tíos
to bury the body,
gotta deal with my boss upstairs.
Plus, I will never hear
the end of it from your mom.
‐ I love you, Dad.
‐ I love you, too, mija.
Nice pin.
‐ Shut up. [laughs, sniffles]
‐ Mommy. I need to...
‐ You took my car
without my permission
to some bowling alley in Agatha?
‐ [whispering] Damn you, Indian Mafia.
‐ You could be dead in a ditch!
What were you thinking?
I trusted you and you lied to me.
‐ I...
‐ What is this?
What happened to my good girl?
Because this,
this is not the daughter I raised.
‐ Maybe it is.
‐ Do not talk back at me.
‐ Maybe I'm not a good girl, Mommy.
Maybe I'm a terrible person
who deserves terrible things.
Maybe I should just stop trying
to be perfect for you all the time,
because the me that makes mistakes,
the me that you don't know...
I feel like it's never
going to be good enough for you.
ROSIE: Sunny?
[knocks on door]
[door opens]
Why do you think
you are a terrible person?
[sighs]
You know, growing up
I made a lot of mistakes.
And I was...
far from perfect.
Especially in my own mother's eyes.
My mother decided everything for me.
She talked at me, never with me.
I don't want our relationship
to be like that.
‐ I need a morning after pill.
I need the car because I needed to go
to the closest Planned Parenthood,
which is very far away,
and I tried to get it at a pharmacy here,
but the pharmacist refused
to sell me the pill,
so it turned into a wild goose chase.
‐ Wait. What do you mean he refused you?
‐ Good afternoon.
How may I help you?
‐ I need the Plan B pill,
for my daughter's friend.
‐ Okay.
LUPE:
So glad I'm here to see this.
‐ [sighs] Great.
Now, when we get home, you are both
cleaning all this mud in here.
It's a total mess!
