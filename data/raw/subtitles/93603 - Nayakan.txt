- Where is your father hiding?
- I don't know
- Why hit the boy?
- I was asking about his father
Aren't you ashamed of yourself,
a police officer?
Let go of him!
He's the union leader's son
Two blows and he'll talk, sir
Let go of him Go out
Don't be scared
You won't come to
any harm as long as I'm here
Tell your father
that no one will harm him
You'll be safe
Father
Sakthivelu
Did the police hit you?
Don't worry, I didn't talk
Why are the police after you?
They say you're a terrorist
They said they'll kill you on sight
Why?
Is it wrong to be a union leader?

Why did you run away
from Thoothukudi?
Failed your exams?
Did you fight with someone
in your family?
I have no family
Did you make trouble?
Did you steal money?
Then what you did?
I killed a man

Dad, can I ask you something?
You pray five times a day,
and you go to the shrine
You never refuse money to anyone
But at night you use
your boat for smuggling
Is that not a sin, Dad?
No, Velu
Anything that can help
others is not wrong

The police?
Here?
Get up!
The police are here
Clear them out!
It's not your land
Evacuate the place!
Catch those scumbags
Clear out!
Clear out the footpath
Move... move away
Get lost
The land doesn't belong to you
What did he say?
- Tell me what he said
- He abused your mother
What did you call my mother?
Speak up!
Dastard Tell me
Speak up, you Madrasi
Speak up!
Does it hurt?
Well, sonny?
Are you angry?
Want to hit me?
Go ahead, hit me
Hit me!
Hit me!
Come on, hit me
If I hit you, you'll die
What?
What did he say?
What did he say?
He's from Madras
I don't know, sir
You Madrasi,
talk in my language!
Idiot! The thrashing didn't teach him
Let's go
You slum insect!
Velu, did they hit you?
Are you hurt?
We just asked Velu, that's all
Brother
Why are you in this state?
Go!
He has fever, but he insists
on going out to sea
- You didn't tell him
- Talk to him, he listens to you
Dad, give that to me
I've given my word
Damn your word!
Can't someone else do the job?
Tell him you're ill
It's not about Durai
Munusamy's mother has died and
they've no money for the funeral
So you want to
go to sea and die?
I promised money for the funeral
Hussain Bhai always keeps his word
So he will
- Go and rest
- What are you doing?
I'll get the goods
Brother
I told him not to go,
now you're going?
No, Velu
Let my wrongdoing end with me
Dad, it's not wrongdoing
Helping people is not a sin
Shakila, take your father home
Go
Velu
This is your first trip
Don't worry, I'm here
- Tie the salt bags to the tubes
- What for?
Tie the salt bags to the tubes
- What are these bags for? Salt?
- That's what I said
- Are we going to trade in salt?
- Just do as I say
You Thoothukudi folk!
Novices!
- I'm looking for the rope
- It's there
Velu, what are you doing?
If we throw the goods overboard,
who'll face Durai?
Velu!
Do you know what they're worth?
They're gone!
When we land, our lives
will be gone too
Keep steering
- Go!
- What the hell?
We're in hot water now
The coast guards are here
If they find the goods,
we'll get five years in jail
But we have nothing on board
You threw them into the sea
Greetings, brothers!
Don't over do it
We escaped the customs,
but what will we tell Durai?
How do we retrieve the goods?
You threw them in
How do we get
the goods from the water?
- What happens to salt in water?
- It gets wet
- And?
- It dissolves
The tubes will then float up
The tubes float up, with the goods!
Velu, you're a genius!
What are you doing?
Hurry
Pay for the goods first
Throw him 200 rupees
Not 200 2,000 rupees
What? 2,000?
Dad usually takes 200
and you want 2,000?
Acting smart? If Durai hears,
you know what will happen
Pay up and take the goods
- What if we don't?
- I'll throw them overboard
- You threatening me?
- No
Here
Fool! Don't you know
what they're worth?
No Tell me
Stop it!
- Stop!
- The money?
Okay, I'll pay your price
Hussain Bhai's men? 2000?
- Is that right?
- Yes, boss
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?
Call the Inspector
Hussain Bhai must die
Got it?
What happened Velu?
So much money?
Your real wages
You risk your life every day
I don't need this much
It isn't for you,
it's for those who you help
My wages are only 200 rupees
I took that for myself and Selva
This is yours
Velu, come
Velu, hurry up!
- Where are we going?

Are you a Tamilian?
Can I ask you something?
Can you let me go early?
One o'clock will do
Why? So you can
earn more money?
No, I have maths exam tomorrow
If you let me go early,
I could study
You're a student?
In school?
Which school?
Dadabhai Naoroji School
- Which class?
- 10th standard
Mid-term exams tomorrow
If you go now, they'll send
another client in
Let me go at one
I'll study here till then
Your books?
Study
Go on!
Last night the police
dragged dad away
Dad?
He hasn't come back
Get out of here!
Look what the police
have done to him
Dad...!
Brother
Brother
Why did they do this?
What harm has he
ever done to anyone?
Why did they kill him?
Tell me
Why did they have to kill dad?
I want my father back
You said you'd get me
anything I wanted
I want father back now
I want father back now
Happy now?
Satisfied?
The old man earned what he could,
but you insisted on haggling
See what you've done
You got him killed and destroyed
the lives of his dependents
- Who took dad?
- That brute of an Inspector
- Where is he?
- Who knows?
- Take care of Shakila
- Get lost
Just take care of her
Don't drink so much
I won't drink
Who is it?
It's you?
Have a drink
Go on
Come on
- What happened?
- Beaten to death, sir
- Found any weapons?
- Not yet, sir
- Any suspects?
- We're investigating, sir
Remove the cover
Where are the witnesses?
The witnesses?
There are no witnesses, sir
- What do you mean?
- They say they saw nothing
You speak Tamil
Ask them in Tamil
They've killed a man
in full view
And you say there are
no witnesses?
I've threatened them
I've tried everything
But no one will talk
So many people here
And no one saw anything?
No one knows who killed him?
We'll make them talk
- Who murdered the Inspector?
- I don't know, I saw nothing
- Who killed him?
- I don't know, I saw nothing
It happened in front of your house,
and you saw nothing?
This boy gets a thrashing
till someone talks
Who killed him?
I don't know I saw nothing
Who killed him?
I don't know I saw nothing
I know who it is
I saw it
- You know who killed him?
- Yes
Who is it?
If you're afraid to say it out loud,
tell me in private
I'm not afraid, I'm proud
I'm proud a man here is capable
of killing that animal
I'm proud that women and children
will live in peace now
I'm proud there's another god here
to whom we can tell our grievances
Why should we betray him?
So that you get a medal?
We'd rather die than give him up
Sir, we know nothing
None of us saw anything
Hitting small children!
You may hide the truth,
but remember...
we won't spare a police
officer's murderer
I want a detailed investigation
Take in all the suspects
I want the report on my table
First thing in the morning
- I don't want any money
- But we had two teas
That won't be necessary
Why not?
It's enough that you
graced our shop
Velu, it will be the same
everywhere, you'll see
Come
Namaste! My father is dead
My father is dead
Dead
He bled a lot
- Aunty, father's dead
- Don't laugh, Ajit
He's been mentally challenged
since his birth
Namaste! My father is dead
- What is it, son?
- Father is dead
Is she Inspector Kelkar's wife?
I'm...
I'm indebted to Inspector Kelkar
I've come to repay my debt
I'll pay you his salary every month
Selva, explain her
- Velu, what is this?
- I don't want it
I don't want the money
It is not for you,
it's for the boy
If a young boy loses his father,
I know the troubles he has to face
Father is dead
This boy shouldn't face trouble
Never forget that
I will pay my debt somehow
What's going on here?
- They're building a factory
- What about our homes?
- They're demolishing them
- Does this land belong to them?
They say they've bought it
- Who bought it?
- The Seth
- Anyone here speak Hindi?
- He does
- You speak Hindi well?
- Yes
Okay, come
Sethji, can you
tell us what's going on?
Can't you see we're busy?
Stay out of it
So he's busy
What's he doing here?
Ask him!
Forgive me, but we want to know
what's going on
Do you think we're twiddling
our thumbs here?
We're building a million rupee factory
You know how much that is?
Get on with your work!
- Factory?
- 10,000 live here
Who gave him permission to build?
They want to know...
Have you got straw instead of brain?
Who do you think you are?
Brothers, ask Durai whatever you want
He's handling everything
Go and talk to him
You go, too
- An honour to see you, sir
- How are you?
We were in a fix, Mr Durai
Perhaps you can help us
Please sit down
Sit down
What is this?
- What's the matter, Velu?
- They're building a factory
- The Seth has bought the land
- But so many live here
The land belonged to the government
Now the Seth is the owner
Can you help?
He showed me the deeds
Show them to him
You can see the government seal
May I?
- What can we do?
- We don't have a choice
We have never paid rent or taxes
Durai, how much did
the Seth pay you?
How much did you sell us for?
Tell me
How much?
Durai saab, any problems?
No! It's nothing
- Come with us, then
- I'm coming
You join me
I'll go with the Seth
Who are you?
Barging in like this
- What do you want?
- Velu! What's all this?
The Seth has no idea what it means
to have your home destroyed
Come
Brothers, stop!
What are you doing?
Who are you? Stop!
Stop breaking everything!
Please, sir
I have small children
I don't want your land
in Dharavi
- I don't want to build a factory
- Listen to me
Let him go
Tell the Seth to tear up the deeds
Tear the document
Document?
Tear them up!
Tear it
Long live brother Velu!
Remember me?
How was your maths exam?
Was it okay?
You don't like me?
You don't like me?
Tell me and I'll go
That's not it
I'm scared I will cry
if I talked to you
I'll fall at your feet and cry
I have no one
Didn't I say I would cry?
Cry!
Cry!
- Selva, I'm going to marry Nila
- Marry her?
Here! Now
Why the hurry? Don't you need
a sacred thread?
Tell the priest
and arrange the wedding, go
- What's this, Velu?
- Go

Sister
A child was dying
Were you picking flowers?
Why didn't you call for
an ambulance?
We did! They said they wouldn't come
Who said?
- We live in the slums
- And so?
They won't come
No ambulance comes to the slums
- How old is your child?
- Eighteen months
Will the doctor replace
the child if it dies?
No one cares about
the lives of the poor
How much does an ambulance cost?
40,000 or 50,000 rupees
We'll buy five! They will not serve
the rich, but the poor of Dharavi
- Five times 5...
- We'll buy them! Never mind
- Sit down
- After you
Ask her what's happening, Iyer
Don't worry
Everything will be all right
What she said?
The boy is out of danger
But he must stay overnight
I'll pay the hospital

- Don't be afraid
Thank him
Doctor, you are a king
We cannot save a life,
but you have
Don't mind me

they control the harbour
No going in or out without
their permission
It seems you know all about us
He's done his homework
- I can't speak Telugu well
- Never mind
How can thousands of people
be out of work for six months?
There's trouble!
Koli and Reddy are squabbling
The police have been nosing
around the docks
Reddy wants to lie low for 6 months
Koli says, 'Impossible'
Two ships are stuck with goods
worth 3 million
Reddy says, 'Can't be done'
Reddy says it's not possible
But let me try! One try
You'll do what Reddy can't achieve?
You're a child Be quiet
I'll unload the goods off the ships
How? If you're caught,
that will be the end
If I'm caught, that's the end of it
But if I'm not...?
Koli saab, I'll get your goods out
Very well, try it
No, impossible
Reddy, sir
If I succeed where Reddy has failed,
the harbour is mine
- Translate word by word
- If our boss succeeds...
- He will...
- Go ahead
he will be the king of the harbour,
not the Reddys
- A thief dares to talk like that!
- Calm down
It's below us to talk to such people
Mr Reddy, never mind
Someone has to do the job
I've decided Let Velu try
- No! Well, Koli saab?
- Go ahead
- And you?
- I agree
This is my final decision
Velu brother, you do it
You've made it
Back at sea at last! We should've
brought some booze
Why didn't you?
Damn! I should have
brought a babe too
If you are so desperate,
why didn't you?
- What did you say?
- You could've brought a girl

Greetings, Lalaji
I have brought Koli's
and Mustapha's goods
Wonderful! You've done it
Well done, Velu brother
How amazing!
Reddy, you've lost face
How much do we owe you?
Nothing! A present of mine
for the Reddy's family
- A present?
- A gift?
To Reddy
We can't let him get away with this
We even tipped off the Customs
What went wrong?
They're a useless lot
Four of our men should've
finished him off
What point now?
If word gets out, our reputation...
Reputation?
We Reddys will be finished
The end of the family, too
Kill Velu Naicker
And his wife and his two children
They must not live
'Intermission'
They're fast asleep in your lap
Look at Surya, he even
sleeps like you do
He keeps saying he wants to be
like you when he grows up
It is true
That's a mistake
Why?
Let this business end with me
They must not lead a life
like mine
They must study hard
Send them to Madras
Shakila will look after them
They can study there
They will come to no harm
What?
Can you bear being without them?
And you? Can you bear it?
You dote on them
I don't matter
they are important ones
Shall I tell you something?
If I were to die now,
I'd die happily
Don't be silly
I mean it
Naicker, sir
Save this poor soul
My life is in danger
Naicker, sir... Naicker, sir
Please help me
Who is it?
Please call him
- Enough
- Who is it?
Who's there?
Tell him not to come
He's in danger
Nila!
Come inside
Dad!
Mom
Mom...!
Everyone is waiting
Are you coming?
By the time Nila's ashes
are immersed...
every male in Reddy's family
should not be alive
Who is it?
Who is it?
What do you want?
What are you doing here?
What is this?
Leave me
No, don't
Who are you? What is it?
The head of the Reddy family?
That's me
My sweet child, listen to me
Listen to me, dear
Surya, look after her
Go
Don't lose the tickets
Father, everyone says
mother died because of you
Is that true?
Tell me, is it true?
Father! Tell me
Father! Tell me
"In the southern realm of the Pandiyas,
on the streets where chariots race"
"He skipped along like a deer
Who could have hurt him?"
"Who could have hurt him?"
"Who could have hurt him?"
"O moon, do not disappear"
"Do not weep"
"Your tears will break my heart"
"Your tears will break my heart"
"In the southern realm of the Pandiyas,
on the streets where chariots race"
"He skipped along like a deer
Who could have hurt him?"
"Who could have hurt him?"
"Who could have hurt him?"
Come, Greetings
Sir, my firstborn
Please name the child
- A girl?
- A boy
Call him Ganesh
Here
Don't fight, I will give
you more later
The food has been blessed in
Charumathi's name
Send her the offerings
Did you hear? It seems that
Charumathi is still a child
She's always up to something
Naicker will have trouble with her
Please stop
Go slow
- Don't just watch
- You're getting old
- Drive on
- Slow down
You'll end up in the sea
Dad, why are you getting scared?
Don't be scared
You don't stop
Hold the steering wheel
Keep going
Stop
Father
Father, are you hurt?
Naicker, are you hurt?
Father, are you all right?
Fortunately, I'm as strong as ever
Fool!
Stop showing off
Run! He's too old to catch you
- May I see Naicker?
- Wait, he will come
I am Sankaran
Once I was very close to him
Now not in touch with him
- I must see him
- What's wrong?
Is he out? I just need
a few minutes
Father is praying Tell me
You can tell him,
he's Naicker's son
Really?
My only son
has got a job after ages
And it's in Dubai
His passport and visa are ready,
he is to fly out tomorrow
Calm down
Driving back from
the passport office...
Go on
he hit a child
- And the child?
- Died on the spot
My son got scared of the mob
and fled, abandoning his car
It wasn't his fault
The child was
playing on the road
He didn't see the car
Now my son's future is ruined
- What sort of car?
- Sir
- What sort of car?
- An Ambassador
- Who owns it?
- I do
Inform the police that your car
has been missing for three days
Put yesterday's date on the report
Leave it to me
Vellachamy, do you have
a driving license?
Yes, I have
- Where was the accident?
- Matunga
Tell the Matunga police that you were
driving and hit the boy
Okay
Get the money from Iyer
I'll look after your family
Father will get you released
Don't worry! Your son will
fly to Dubai tomorrow
Dear!
Have no fear! I am Velu Naicker's son
I keep my word
Thank you
Look at him!
Yesterday you were just a kid
Now you're solving problems
like your father
You handled the situation like
your father would
Naicker, did you hear what he did?
He'll be twice the man we are
- You have missed to see
- I've seen
Surya
Don't be like me
But, father...
Go!
Ajit
Sir, I want to be an Inspector
An Inspector?
He wants to be like his father
He tried joining the police force
I want to be an Inspector
They rejected him because
of his mental condition
I know the police drill
Shall I show you?
- No
- See
Attention
Say 'Stand at ease'
Okay
'Stand at ease'
Make me an Inspector
Okay
From now you're my personal
Inspector! Mine alone
I'll handle it
Naicker uncle!
The Superintendent of Police
is coming
- Who?
- Raghavan
- Raghavan? Why is he here?
- I don't know
Let him come
- Anything else?
- No, that's all
I'm Raghavan
I know! SP
I've known you for 20 years
Come
Welcome
I have no search or arrest warrant
People do not come here with
warrants, but search if you wish
I am not here as a police officer;
I've come to ask for your help
Sit down
Sit on the chair,
I prefer sitting here
May I speak in private?
Go!
Tell me
My daughter was to get
married next week
I know
Now she can't
She's in hospital
Oh God
She is like a limp rag
What happened?
I taught her, as a police officer's
daughter, to be brave...
to go out at any time
without fear
Last night she went out
to buy clothes
But she returned a limp rag
Four sons of important families...
attacked her in the open
Oh God
But you have the whole
police force behind you
Break their bones and
throw them in the lock up
I know who they are
But I cannot touch them
Why not?
- Minister's son
- What?
One is a wretched minister's son
Otherwise I would've torn him to pieces,
made him unidentifiable
I told my boss
He asked for witnesses
There were none
He asked if I was rich I am not
But they are rich
He advised me to drop the case
The rich can twist the truth
I can't let it go
She is my daughter after all
I can't bear to look at her
I've tried everything
Now I've come to you
- I understand your grief
- It's not just that, those boys...
I have a daughter too
I'll handle it
Don't stay here too long
I'll handle it
I'll handle it
That's enough Let's go
I've come from the hospital
The boy you attacked is still alive
But only just
He'll be crippled for life
Satisfied?
She saw me
Not only you, but your brutality
An innocent boy,
beating him in full view?
He deserved to be punished
Who are you to judge?
Charu, you don't get it
The police officer's...
What?
Father, tell me
Who do you think you are?
Are you God?
Who are you to decide
what is just and punish others?
Why did you do it?
I gave my word
To whom?
To a father like myself
Really?
You gave your word to attack
a boy mercilessly? Right?
He committed a terrible crime
However terrible, who are you
to punish him?
The police and the courts exist;
why not leave it to them?
Why do you do this?
You're educated, you've led
a life of comfort
But we are not like you
We struggled to eat, we risked
our lives to earn money
We shed blood to bring our
earnings home
Never sure that we'd live
to see another day
No
The idea of the police and courts
never crossed our minds
We met blow with blow,
wielded a knife to survive
So does that justify
your behaviour?
I do what I think is right
Father, can I do
what I think is right?
I think Selva was wrong to attack
the boy, so I'll attack him in return
- How dare you
- Don't do, Naicker
Let her go
Leave her
She's our girl
How dare you hit Selva!
- Where did she learn such tricks?
- From us
Let it be
Let go!
Father, why did you hit me?
Why did you hit me?
You hit Selva
So it's wrong for me to hit Selva?
It's right for me, wrong for you
What you think is right
is wrong for others
I shouldn't have hit you
It's okay, but it's still wrong
to harm other people
What should I do?
Stop all this It's enough
I'll be killed if I stopped
So you will never stop
till you die?
I will! But ask them to stop
- Ask who?
- All of them
Who?
The man who shot a union leader
who asked for his rights
Ask that killer to stop and I will
They hanged an old man
and said it was suicide
Ask them to stop and I will
The Seth who set bulldozers on
people living in the slums
Ask him to stop and I will
The man who murdered your mother...
ask him to stop and I will
Do we act like this willingly?
We had no choice
Ask your heart... Don't you believe
what you do is wrong?
It is not wrong, if it helps
even a few people
Must you kill a man
to help a few?
- You don't understand
- There's nothing to understand
Nor do I wish to understand
Let go!
Selva, ask him to go away
Tell him not to talk to me
Go! It will be all right
Come
- I want to see Velu Naicker
- Father is not well
It's urgent
Be seated
Father
Father, SP Raghavan is here
He wants to see you urgently
Shall I bring him in?
- You're ill?
- It's only a cold
The chair
Sit down
Do you know Pandiyan?
Pandiyan from Salem?
He worked for me for a short time
He's been arrested
Tomorrow, in court...
he'll testify against you
He is a state witness
I haven't forgotten how you
helped me... You're in trouble
As a police officer, I cannot
prevent this, nor should I
I don't know how you
can prevent this situation...
but I thought I must let you know
Bye
My daughter is well now
Get Selva
He's not here
You told him to leave
Bombay for a while
I'll handle it
Don't you trust me?
- Surya, this needs...
- I know
If Pandiyan goes to court,
he must not talk
We cannot use our men
We'll hire outsiders
They shouldn't know
about the victims details
The trail should not lead back to us
I'll handle it
Naicker!
I swear to tell the truth...
other than the truth
nothing else
It's Surya! Pandiyan is...
No
Not on the phone
Tell me in person
OKay, dad
I didn't want you to worry
- Pandiyan is dead
- Why come here?
He didn't talk in court
The dastard is dead
I'll hang up
Surya...
Did you say something?
Come home
Okay, dad
I told you to send someone else
for the money
Calm down! Those cops couldn't
catch me in court
They can't get me here
You blew it!
Don't worry, sir
With all their jeeps,
they couldn't get me
- Did you swap the vehicle?
- No, why?
- Same vehicle
- Yes
What brings you here
at this hour, Iyer?
Inspector, no salute today?
Iyer, what's the matter?
Everyone has arrived so early
Superintendent, at this hour?
What's wrong?
Brother Velu
Brother Velu, God is testing you
Be brave
Tell me, is anyone hurt?
Brother Velu
Only Allah's will counts
Man's will is nothing
I don't understand
Has something happened?
Why so quiet?
Be brave My son is your son
I don't get it
What has happened?
My son is your son
Where is Surya?
Where is Surya?
Surya
He was badly burned
Don't look at him, Naicker
Don't look
Father!
"In the southern realm of the Pandiyas,
on the streets where chariots race"
"He skipped along like a deer
Who could have hurt him?"
"Who could have hurt him?"
"Who could have hurt him?"
"O moon, do not disappear"
"Do not weep"
"Your tears will break my heart"
"Your tears will break my heart"
"In the southern realm of the Pandiyas,
on the streets where chariots race"
"He skipped along like a deer
Who could have hurt him?"
"Who could have hurt him?"
"Who could have hurt him?"
Father, I'm going
I'm leaving you
I cannot stay here any longer
First you killed my mother,
then my brother
If I stay any longer, I will die
I don't want to be your daughter
Charu dear
I'll consider myself an orphan,
I'll go back to Madras
Don't stop me
Don't send your men after me
I do not want to know
if you're dead or alive
Let me go
Think you have no wife or son
And now no daughter
Imagine that you have disowned me
Let me go, father
As always, I've offered prayers
in your daughter's name
Shall I look for Charumathi?
No, I promised not to bother her
Perhaps she is in trouble
She is my daughter
She'll survive
Iyer, see who it is
If it's the new police officer,
ask him to let us finish
- Tell him I said so
- Naicker sir, I'll handle it
- They say we have no permission
- Who needs permission to pray?
They say we need permission for
the lights and loudspeakers
But we've prayed here for 30 years
They say we've broken
the law for 30 years
How dare he!
- Who is he?
- The new Asst. Commissioner
- Assistant
- Commissioner
Who is it?
'Tamil Welfare Society'
Impound the vehicles
- But they serve the poor, sir
- They serve other purposes, too
- Do what I say
- Sir, this is Velu Naicker's area
A Tamil area We'll have problems
Who pays your wages?
The police? Or Velu?
All them right now
'Tamil Welfare Society Bombay'
Who do you take us for?
Naicker will throttle you
Who cares!
Who?
- Who dared to touch Selva?
- The Assistant Commissioner
- Who is it?
- Commissioner
They beat him in public
and arrested him
Aren't you ashamed to tell me?
Were you picking flowers?
No one has ever touched Selva
Would I have allowed that?
Why was he arrested?
I don't know, sir
All right
You didn't ask?
Did you lose your tongue?
The AC hits our men
the moment he sees them
Is that so?
Aren't you tough?
Why didn't you ask?
He'd throw me in jail
You coward Scared of a uniform
Look at these scars
Feel my arm
This is no coward's body
Where does this policeman live?
- Where?
- Why must you go there?
What are you saying?
Our Selva is in jail
Where does the AC lives?
Tell me, Swamy
Too scared?
Naicker, sir
I know
Is Mr.Patil at home? Call him
Call him... Go
Mr.Commissioner!
Who is it?
Father?
I knew no other way...
to absolve the sins I've lived
with since I was born
At least my children will be good
That's why I married a police officer
- Does he know who you are?
- No, I told him I'm an orphan
That's what he believes So do I
Mom... mom
One minute
Your child?
A boy?
Father, please leave him alone
He doesn't need to know that
he's related to a man like you
You must leave
Mom
Please
Please go
See this? An arrest warrant
for Velu Naicker
- Where is Velu Naicker?
- Not here
- Where is he?
- I don't know
Search
Search the place
Check that room
- Where is Naicker?
- I don't know
- Where is Naicker? Speak up
- I don't know
Look upstairs
- Haven't you found him?
- No, sir
- Where is Velu Naicker?
- Not here
- Where is he?
- I don't know
Arrest him
Check the houses, search everywhere
Go... go ahead
Keep looking
Don't leave any house
- Where is Naicker hiding?
- I don't know
Look in there
Inside!
- Where is Velu Naicker?
- I don't know
- Speak up! Where is he?
- I don't know
Round them up
Mr. Naicker! The police!
You better run
Police is coming
Go from here
Follow me!
Let go of me
Let go of me
Couldn't you arrest Velu Naicker?
No, sir
Why?
We're doing our best, sir,
but the public sides with him
They protect him and refuse to talk,
even when beaten
They'd die for him
I just saw a woman
immolate herself for him
Why do they worship such a man
like a God? I don't understand
Maybe it's not the public alone
who is helping him
Someone is informing him where
and when you're going to raid
Meaning?
Velu Naicker had two children
The son died in an explosion
And the daughter is still alive
He sent them to Madras as children
Few people know that
he has a daughter
How's that relevant?
Why come here?
We'll manage... Please go
Oh God!
God!
Iyer, what's this?
Not a word I didn't say a word
I didn't know I had the guts
Selva, put him to bed
- Are you well?
- I'm fine
It would be an honour for me
to die for you
Anjamma! It's Velu here
She's unconscious
She can't speak
The doctor said that she would
not survive the night
Naicker, if you lose heart,
what will happen?
O Mother, enough
Enough
- Where's the telephone?
- Come
- Call the Assistant Commissioner
- What are you going to do?
Call the AC
Their sacrifice will be meaningless
All that I have done
is meaningless
I always thought it's fine to do
wrong if it helps others
All these people, the children
are suffering for an old man
This is not right
Velu!
Leave me
Father? Is that you?
Is that you?
Yes...
Velu Naicker speaking
Is the Assistant Commissioner in?
What happened? Are you hurt?
Apparently he is looking for me
Tomorrow is Nila's...
your mother's death anniversary
He can arrest me after the ceremony
I can't
Listen to me
You know what they'll do
I know... Tell him
I can't do that
Who was that?
Who called?
Who were you talking to?
Tell me... who?
Who was on the phone?
- My father
- You mean Velu Naicker?
Does he want to know
where the next raid will take place?
And where to hide
- What did he say?
- He told me to take you to him
He told me where
you'd find him tomorrow
He said you could arrest him there
'Velu Naicker Arrested'
You must give evidence
against Velu Naicker
He named my child... I will not
stand in court against him
You've known him a long time,
you must testify
- His trial is coming up
- I know
You must stand witness
for the prosecution
Don't be scared
We'll protect you
Why not? You know
the sort of man he is
That's why I cannot
give evidence against him
Your husband, Inspector Kelkar
Do you know who killed him?
Velu Naicker
I know
And yet you won't testify?
- No
- Why?
He gave my son a life
He made him a man
That is enough for me
Let's go
Leave us alone
Sit down
Many say that Naicker never
refuses to help
I need your help
I'm just an ordinary man in prison
You're a senior police officer
How could I help you?
I thought you were scum
I was desperate to throw
you in jail
But so many hold you in high esteem,
it seems I was wrong
Our aims are the same,
with one difference
I wear a uniform and you don't
I need your help now
You're educated, you use big words
I'm uneducated
I will do what I can.
What do you want?
The verdict is tomorrow
There's tension on the streets
If there's rioting, people will die
Only you can help us
in avoiding bloodshed
I believe that you can do it
The verdict may be against you,
perhaps it's a death sentence
I should've died when I was ten
There will be no trouble tomorrow
You can go now
I want to ask another favour
Would you bless your grandson?
Thank you
Long live Velu Naicker!
Long live Velu Naicker!
Why are you in prison?
Did you do wrong?
Are you a good man or a bad man?
Tell me, are you good or bad?
I don't know
Don't know
- What's your name?
- Velu... Sakthivelu
Do you know my name?
No
The same as yours: Sakthivelu
O Lord!
Nothing will happen to you,
we're all here
Okay, sir
Okay
Don't worry, sir
Go inside Nothing will go wrong
We are here for you
Nothing will go wrong
Everyone is here
You go inside
There are so many of us,
no one can touch you
There's no evidence against Naicker
No witnesses
No one can do anything
to our Naicker
Naicker... sir
Father?
Father?!
