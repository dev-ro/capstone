Well, what sex is that carrot?
We'll be on...
Hey Cheyenne.
Isn't it kinda dangerous to invest
in stockmarket with all these crises?
Danger is my middle name.
Why do we always come here?
- The coffee is shit.
- It's about the atmosphere.
- You know where they make good coffee?
- In Naples,
you drank coffee there on May 31, 1984,
during the "Cheyenne Bad Friends" tour.
Bad Friends with Cheyenne.
If this crisis drags on,
you can write my official biography.
I would like to write when you went swimming
and possibly a person will
stole your clothes and shoes.
Naples is a violent place.
Violence is everywhere. Only
that it doesn't always show.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- I am Cheyenne.
- I know.
I near at hand would be Desmond.
- This would be Desmond.
- Mary.
Excuse me for being too
direct, Mary, but I'm...
I was wondering if it's okay
with your father here and...
- maybe we could go out sometime.
- He's not my father.
I think that the idea of the two of you...
going out together is...
nice, alright?
What sort of music do you listen to?
Mariah Carey.
Thank you for your invitation Desmond,
but I'm afraid I'm busy
for the next 14 years.
Something's wrong here?
I don't know exactly what it is.
There's something.
Hey Chey?
Hey, how are you doing?
Tesco's shot up.
If I sell now, we'll make 30,000 euros.
You know, I don't think this stock
exchange is doing you much good.
Really?
- What's for supper?
- Pizza.
- Vinci pizza.
- You're full of surprises.
This is one of the reasons
I fell in love with you.
What're we gonna do with
the pizza if you lose?
I never lose.
- Is that so?
- Sometimes I let you win.
Really?
And why would you do that?
To you to feel like a stallion.
Game to me,
21-12.
Because of my fuckin' sciatica.
Oh that's right. I've told
you sometimes let you win.
Did you really mean that?
- Any news of Tony?
- No nothing.
Have you opened that letter from MTV?
Can you pass the cream to me?
- Aren't you even curious to know that stuff?
- Only a bit, why?
Oh my God, look, when you see these people
you've got to tell me. This is really gross.
MTV has worldwide coverage, you
know that? It's broadcast live.
And this year as a very special guest,
after 20 years out of the spotlight they
would like to have Cheyenne and the Fellows.
Where is Lady Gaga?
Don't you even think about it?
I already did think about it 20 years ago.
I'm still busy.
I'm gonna to wait for you in bed.
Naked.
- Who are you?
- The future.
- Can I speak with your husband?
- Yeah, sure, right over there.
Howdy, I'm Steven,
we saw each other at the mall.
I was singin' a Bonnie "Prince" Billy,
did you remember?
- Uh... I don't remember.
- No, of course you don't,
because of it's shitty cover.
Oh, shitty cover.
I bought a live demo we
do with me and my group.
I want you to produce our first album.
- I'm not a producer.
- You should be.
- Well you're rather determined, aren't you?
- Rather.
What made you think of me?
What? You used to let the rhythm guitar to
dominate over the master band and lead guitar.
Nobody did that
and I completely agree with that approach,
I have even heard that the Virgens do too.
Yeah, we had that problem
so we had to get rid of the guitars.
I can't get rid of the guitars, man,
he's my brother.
Listen, if you produce it you
could have you say about everything.
Except the name of the group
that is not negotiable.
What do you call yourselves?
"The Pieces of Shit".
- This is a really good choice.
- Fuckin' right it is, yeah.
It took us six months to come up with that.
Besides, it's exactly the right name
for this moment in history.
I'll see you.
I don't have this one, fuck a bootleg copy.
Fuck! Desmond,
where did you come across this relic?
I uh...
- When I...
- You gave it to him.
- What the fuck does that mean?
- You two arrange the whole thing.
- Fuckin' moroons.
- You're fuckin' paranoid.
I'm sorry, Mary.
I invited Desmond for supper on
Friday and you have to come too.
Forget it.
Not in your life.
Morgan Labs, buy 70, hold 30%.
- That bitch Melany dumped me.
- How long were you together?
- Four days.
- Are you suffering?
Like the last panda standing.
That woman extinguished me.
Keep an eye on the Tesco shares. They're
like a group of teenage girls.?????
Listen, I want to tell you about
the girl I dumped Wednesday.
One leg in a cast, made it one of
the most satisfying moments ever.
No, no. I don't think
that would interest me.
Excuse me. Karen, God bless,
thanks for calling me back.
Yeah, yeah. I feel so lonely.
- How is your life, grandma?
- Great,
except for my husband.
Take a lover.
I have that already, like everything else.
And yours?
My life? Now I feel just...
high.
How many times must we tell you
you are not welcome at our sons' graves.
Eh Friday...
That dinner you mentioned.
I'll be there.
Did you do the bike?
The bike...
I was just asking myself
why with all the vices I've been taught
in my life I never took up smoking.
Where is my son?
That's what you should be asking yourself.
Everything else is bullshit.
- Unfortunately I don't know where he is.
- Go find him then. All of you.
Three months is an eternity.
Why?
If everything is just fine,
why would someone just leave...
without saying a word?
Without sending news.
Why?
You never took up smoking...
because you remained a child.
Children are the only ones that
never get the urge to smoke.
Tony never smoked either.
Okay, I know you're wondering
what's the position you have to use
to shack someone whose leg
is in a cast up to the crotch.
I wasn't wondering that...
You have to use different things,
you know, experiment.
How do you manage to get all these women?
If you think about it,
You are not handsome,
you are not smart.
Instead you're evasive,
and egocentric,
and you sweat like a pig.
- So what makes you so fuckin' special?
- Special? No, no.
Nothing. But I've got two things
that most other men don't have.
I've got curiosity... and time,
you see? So I...
I dedicate a whole lot of time to women, you
know, and in the end that will seduce them.
I am beside them all the time.
Through the six months you
have the every fuckin' day.
Do you understand? And they don't cave in
because they're so exhausted, huh,
they cave in because they didn't believe
they were worth all that fun, do you get it?
Pretty much.
And the curiosity part?
The curiosity is the fire that keeps
you going for six months straight.
You know what my lame leg
looked just before I came?
She was panting. She exploded at my cast.
She said "I want you to sign it for me."
Moments like that make you
feel you're a better man, you know.
What the fuck are you doing. You're
like making me talk to myself, dude?
Have I ever told you about the time
that Jane fell asleep watching TV,
while smoking a joint?
And the pillow on the couch caught
on fire, but I realized that in time
and managed to put it out?
I've forgotten to tell you a crucial detail,
Desmond, that's why you're not laughing.
Jane is a firefighter by profession.
- So, Desmond, you live alone or not?
- Me? No.
I live with my family, Unfortunately.
- I have six brothers.
- Fuck! Six brothers.
Yeah. Six lazy slags that
don't do a damn thing all day.
It would be good if they all vanish
from the face of the earth for a while.
Excuse me. I need to go to the bathroom.
Nice move, Desmond.
What did I say wrong?
Nothing, women are always running
out to the bathroom, you know.
When you're young, you
think it's for cocaine,
but as years go by you learn
that there are many reasons,
well, like food stalling their teeth,
or period.
Yeah, take notes Desmond. Jeffery
clearly knows all about us women.
Cheyenne, the roast beef looks lovely.
Too bad Michelle and I don't eat meat.
Michelle is her doggie.
Fuck.
How deep is it? How
is the deepest point?
Seven feet.
What's wrong with your dog?
I don't know. Jane looks after him.
- You don't work, Cheyenne?
- I don't have to.
Everyone needs work.
- Do you have any kids?
- No.
- Why not?
- Rock stars shouldn't have kids,
as you run the risk that your
daughter becomes a wrecky stylist.
Why isn't there any water in your pool?
I don't know.
No one ever filled it.
- What about you doing it?
- Well, as a matter of fact...
Jane and I play bare hand Pelota in it.
And Pelota is more fun than swimming.
- So why did you...
- Desmond,
I didn't invite you to get
here to interview me. Sorry.
It's alright.
I have never succeeded with Mary.
I really fancy her.
The secret is time, Desmond.
Spend time with her.
All the time she needs.
Then she'll come around. you'll see.
That's what wins women over,
and makes them feel safe.
Please don't give up on Mary, Desmond.
Promise me.
I think I'm at time depressed.
I think a man who does that
with his wife for 35 years
as if for the first time
is not depressed.
Maybe you are confusing depression
with boredom.
My father is dying of old age.
A non-existent disease
that I haven't flown in 30 years.
- Fear of flying isn't your only problem.
- That is true.
I also have a mild fear of dying.
You can't die until you
sell off the Tesco shares.
- What will you do when I'm away?
- All the usual things.
Take it easy on the Tai Chi.
- Jane, can I ask you something?
- Naturally. What?
Why did you let that architect,
write "cuisine" on the kitchen wall,
It's silly. I know
what the kitchen is.
Come back to me soon. You know
I can't live without your.
That's not true,
but it's kind of you to say.
The problem is that it doesn't last.
Gone in half an hour whatever or not.
- It's true.
- You look so pretty without that.
I'm not joking. I'm serious.
Have you tried the bee pollen.
It usually lasts quite a while.
No, you need more of
hydrating elements like Lancome.
Otherwise it feels like
plaster after an hour.
The brand doesn't matter.
If you want it stay in power,
you have to put a thin layer of face powder
on your lips first. That's the secret.
Then your lipstick will last all day.
- Hi cousin.
- Hi Richard.
You're late, what took you so long?
The next time I'll play the whole city.
I'm just kidding.
David, there's something
I have to tell you.
Even though we haven't seen
each other for all these years,
I still can't believe
you consider me a friend.
Why was that?
Because we haven't the
slightest thing in common.
You have such foresight thoughts,
ideas that you turn into reality,
and you amaze people with your ideas.
And they call you the most extraordinary
thing and artist and they're right.
David Byrne is an artist.
- Will you do that when you're performing?
- The fuck I was, David, the fuck I was.
I was a fucking pop star.
I used to write dreary songs
because they were all the rage
and made tones of money.
Depressed songs for depressed kids,
and two of them, more
fragile than the rest,
ended up doing themselves
in as a result of it.
And now I go to a cemetery once a week
to appease my guilt,
and it doesn't make it better.
It makes it fuckin' worse.
And then my wife asks me
why I don't play anymore,
and I think she must be a fool
because she just loves me very
much, which makes her more of a fool
because she doesn't know what
a disaster her husband is.
And that's it, David, that's it!
Before the inferno,
my life could be summed up in a single word,
lightheartedness.
To ensure a safe passage, we will join...
Who is that?
Do you know who that is?
- Everyone knows him.
- Not me.
- That's Mordecai Midler.
- Who is he?
A legend.
I got it right here,
call me about half an hour.
Wait, we got a deal, right?
The ring's in my pocket.
Enjoy yourself, my friend.
If you wanna look death in the face, you
can't go wrong in a tourist trap like this.
Ernie Ray, financial broker.
Big deals as you've ever needed.
Do I look like someone who makes big deals?
Hey, money can be found in
the most improbable place.
- It's experience talking, my friend.
- That's your big experience talking, Ernie.
You know you're a good guy, you.
Tell me, how fuckin' old are you,
I can't figure out.
I'm as old as I look under
all this face paint and lipstick.
You're a good guy, I knew it.
I know you got some sorta
big problems right now.
But I won't ask now because
I know you wouldn't tell me.
Do you know what my problem is now?
No, but I have the feeling I'm
gonna to be hearing about it.
So if the boss calls me
an hour ago and says Ernie
you have to go to London
tomorrow and stay for a month.
That's all well and
good, except for the fact
that I'm in New York City with my pick-up
and I'm gonna to get back to Texas.
My wife needs me,
not believe me that makes a difference.
The real problem is a garage in
the city costs me a bloody fortune.
That my friend... that's my problem.
If I recall correctly, there are companies
that deal with that sort of thing.
Hey, I'm not giving up my pickup to some
fuckin' company,
I trust not.
- There is no solution.
- You're right.
There's no solution.
Did you read them?
I've read through them. they
didn't talk about me at all.
You have never said a word about
him. You two are exactly the same.
- How about the sketches they did over there?
- I didn't understand.
You do everything that might
be of help in searching for him.
In searching for Richard?
I didn't talk to my father in 30 years.
I don't know the first thing about him.
After you left for Ireland,
all he ever did was
search for Aloise Lange,
his persecutor at Auschwitz
in every corner of the United States.
He never found him,
but he got awfully close.
So close that he found his American wife.
Those drawings are important.
They could lead right to the
hiding place a Nazi Criminal.
- Are not they all dead?
- Not all dead.
Life expectancies are different here.
So what am I supposed
to do with this stuff?
You can take it to Mordecai Midler, who
urged all some 700 Nazi Criminals.
- Why didn't you talk to him in 30 years?
- He didn't love me.
I have some materials that
maybe of service in capturing
a Nazi war criminal named Aloise Lange.
Teeth. I am interested
in teeth, my dear boy.
It was since the Nazis die,
they became too old to be extradited.
I'm looking for the teeth.
What's with the gold teeth
of the Jews happened?
Tons of teeth.
Stashed in a safe somewhere?
Or hanging around the
necks of some crowned dames?
This is what I want to know,
because those teeth are ours.
Something is no quite right here, I'm
not deadly sure, but something...
I know, because this is not an
argument for trendy boys like you.
Your father, he spoke to me about you.
- Are you going to look for Aloise Lange?
- No, I'm looking for the teeth like I've said.
You really take after your father.
You both are rather pedantic.
My instinct tells me that pedantry is an
essential characteristic for capturing Nazis.
True. But solitude is the
playground of resemblance.
Your father was too much a loner.
He's sorta feeding his
resentment toward someone
who are a lot less wicked than many others.
I know who Aloise Lange is.
He is a nobody.
Besides, he's got to be a 95 by now.
The chances are 9 out of 10 he's already dead.
- But did the two of you actually look for him?
- A little, he was a small fish.
- We were hunting sharks.
- Of course.
That makes a bigger impression.
What're you insinuating?
That you the Nazi Hunters
follow the rules of show business
and go after the biggest publicity.
I don't let anyone play me for
a fool looking for publicity.
- We all play the fool sometimes.
- Yeah, speak for yourself.
Oh, dressed up like that.
Now listen up boy, I sacrifice my own
life in order to find those bastards.
That's not exactly what
I call show business.
A lot of Jews who survived,
they got over it, but not me.
I am 79 years old,
but I'm still living in 1940.
Just like your father.
- Are you a practicing Jew?
- No.
- You know about the Holocaust?
- In a general sort of way.
And your father?
Did you know your father?
In a general sort of way.
Where the fuck have you
been living all this time?
How're you with dogs?
I have a dog, my wife looks after him.
I take care of mine.
Name is Who.
The fucker's full of rage inside,
but he won't show it... like you.
Can I have your mobile number?
I've never had a cell phone.
Before the inferno, my life could
be summed up in a single word...
lightheartedness.
As a child I like to stare at the Polish sky,
the same sky that later
I saw from the camp,
stained with black stripes,
the smoke of my relatives.
Yet that macabre vision
did not prevent me from
enjoying the beauty of the sky.
Another monstrous thought,
like all the thoughts
people in the inferno had.
Ladies and gentlemen, "The Pieces of Shit".
Do you have a free room?
They are all free.
Hi Jane, how are you?
Any news of Tony?
No, I'm not in the least bit tired.
I'll board the ship in half an hour.
Who knows, you can't tell how
rough it's gonna be from the port.
Richard's fine. he is growing
into a very handsome man,
except that he has false teeth.
Why are you laughing?
Oh shit, they are so perfect that
you can't believe they are real.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm just jealous.
In a week from now, I'll be home.
Are you used to drink a lot?
You have to decide to stop.
Do you like tattoos?
I was just asking myself about that
when I was looking at you. I don't know.
I never made up my mind yet.
I make tattoos for a living.
- That must be a good job.
- Not a job.
It's an art.
Have you noticed how
nobody works anymore...
and everybody does something artistic?
And what are you doing?
At this particular moment?
I'm tryin' to fix up a sad boy...
and a sad girl,
and it's not easy.
I suspect...
that sadness is not
compatible with sadness.
I fixed up my aunt. She is
handicapped with a friend of mine.
A barber, good barber.
It's a beautiful thing.
They keep each other company...
and they are grateful to me.
Another beautiful thing...
gratitude.
Life is full of beautiful things.
True, but gratitude is the
most beautiful thing of all.
And what are you doing here
in this godforsaken place.
I am looking for a Nazi
criminal from Auschwitz.
Really?
Aren't they all dead?
That's what I thought too,
but apparently they're not.
And what're you gonna do when you find him?
- Would you like to kill me, dear?
- No ma'am.
Why would I want to do that?
I'm John Smith, a former student of yours.
And I was in the area,
and I thought I would stop by to say hello.
No, I don't recall that name. That's
odd because I remember all my students.
Oh of course, in high school
I didn't dress like this
and I wore no makeup.
And why do you do it now
that you are grown, John?
I don't like this one bit.
You have to promise me...
that you address this problem of yours.
- I promise.
- That's not the point.
The point is...
your name doesn't ring a bell.
Maybe because it's such a common name.
- Jackie, you like my student?
- Of course not.
Jackie has a terrible temper.
- I really enjoyed your history lessons, ma'am.
- Thank you, dear.
I still remembered one
that was very memorable.
- About the Holocaust.
- The Holocaust?
Oh, that's odd. We never used to get
to that till the end of the school term.
And then we would just
rushed right through it.
- Sometimes I would skip it altogether.
- Not in my year.
I remember it. It was very touching.
Naturally... It... it...
It was a tragedy.
Children.
No one should ever touch a children.
Why did the Germans decide
to exterminate the Jews?
That... oh... dear, that's one of those
million-dollar questions, I'm afraid.
But so many books have been written
about it, and you're a historian,
so you must have thought about it.
They wanted their money.
Their money?
- But not all the Jews were rich.
- They all had something.
- This tea is delicious.
- No, it is not,
I can't make good tea.
I try to develop a habit...
but I have never had a life of habits.
How is your husband?
My husband is dead unfortunately.
He's been dead for 10 years.
I'm sorry. And your children?
Nathan lives in Asia.
- I never see him.
- That's a shame.
No, Nathan was a complicated soul.
We do get to see my granddaughter Rachel.
I get to see Rachel...
every once and a while.
Emily, be a good girl!
There have been real pleasure,
but I must be going now.
I simply don't remember that name.
You'll come to it, sooner or later.
Goodnight Emily.
Do you need a ride?
No shit. Now I remember you.
You sang with Mick Jagger once.
I know him. He's a good singer.
I like the way he dances.
I think your cheeseburger
is a bit too well done.
You don't mind, do ya?
Unfortunately, it's life.
You know what the problem is, Rachel?
What?
Without realizing it, we go
from an age where we say
"My life will be that too"
to an age where we say
"That' life."
Hey man, I'm sorry,
I didn't do it on purpose.
I'm sorry, really.
We will be more careful.
It's not a question of being careful.
It's a question of knowing
how to play ping-pong.
You serve. It's your point. You
win the next one the game is yours.
It's your serve.
Or we can wrap this up tomorrow
if you want. It's up to you now.
That's not fair.
I was distracted.
This is a common problem with
all the youth... distraction.
Don't forget to leave a tip.
No, I'm not that kind of girl.
I'm not that kind of boy.
He's afraid of the water.
But he is a brave boy.
He gets over all my crisis.
What did you do when you're in my age?
Other than playing music?
Sniffing heroin.
- You didn't shoot that?
- I'm afraid of needles.
- Fear saves us every time.
- Every time.
But you have to choose
a moment in your life,
even one,
to not be afraid.
- And have you chosen that moment?
- Yeah.
This time.
I can't explain why I didn't
talk to my father for 30 years.
I must have thought that
there was a mutual contempt.
When I was 15 I decided,
that he didn't love me,
because I made up my
eyes exactly as I do now.
When you're a kid,
it's very hard to back
off from your decisions.
But I pretended to be a kid for too long.
And only now that I realize...
that a father can help...
and love his child.
That I have no kids...
makes me really, really sick
And now that I realize it, it's too late.
- It's better late than never.
- That's not true,
late is late.
There is an air force base nearby.
A lot of military live here.
We also have the biggest
pistachio in the world here.
It's a sculpture.
It's even in the Guinness Book of Records.
And the littlest one, where is that?
I know how to sing.
I have no doubt.
I don't know how to play.
That's not true, my mom
says you're a singer.
He even sang with Mick Jagger.
Actually Mick Jagger sang with me.
It's his idea.
Well, rock history review
right here in our house, Tommy.
Can you play something, please?
Just one song.
I don't play anymore and besides
I don't know if I remember how.
My music teacher said once
you learn you never forget.
Maybe he was just trying to be nice
so he can earn some money out of you.
Please, just one.
Fuck!
- What do you want me to play?
- "This Must Be The Place" by Arcade Fire.
Nonsense, "This Must Be The Place"
is by the Talking Heads.
- No, it's by Arcade Fire.
- Trust me, you're delusional.
"This Must Be The Place"
is by the Talking Heads.
Arcade Fire merely did the cover.
This is "Where I...
"...I'm going". I was just
seeing if the guitar wasn't tuned.
Oh, sorry.
Thank you, it was a
pleasure performing with you.
What's your relationship with your father?
It's good,
even though I never see him.
He lives in Hong Kong.
He never comes back to America.
But... there are some dark side
in my family too.
- Oh yeah.
- Like everyone's, I guess.
My father, for example,
he broke off all relations
with his parents years ago.
And I never knew why.
I asked him a thousand times
and he'd never really say.
Did you ever ask your
grandparents about it?
They're just as evasive.
Once, when I was twelve,
my grandfather told me
something I've never forgotten.
He said, "Whatever happens, remember
I'll always be part of your life."
And he had tears in his
eyes when he said that.
- Do you ever see him?
- No, almost never.
He lives far away...
in a little town in Utah.
In Huntsville.
I can't make love with you, Rachel.
I'm married.
Before the inferno, there was home.
That first furtive kiss
in the backyard at age 13.
The smell and stain of home.
The black clouds.
The flu of approaching thunder.
The child refuge in the
corner near the window.
The blanket over me when
I was sick with fever.
Blissful boredom.
And shivers of joy.
- Mum!
- It was, in short, a mental intimacy.
We can't predicate the
loss of mental intimacy,
thus establishing a new kind of death,
a breathing death.
There are many ways to dying,
the worst of that...
is to continue living.
- Anything from Tony?
- No.
What are you doing? Are you...
Aren't you trying to find
yourself or something?
No Jane...
I'm not trying to find myself.
I'm in New Mexico, not India.
When're you coming home?
I'll call you later.
Was it yours?
No. It's Ernie Ray's.
Changed the oil recently?
About an hour and a half ago.
You've put too much in it.
Too much oil can cause
spontaneous combustion.
Can happen.
Pretty unusual, but it sure can happen.
A lot of unusual things have
been happening to me lately.
Let's get to the point?
I'm no intellectual, but I do
know what things are called.
Do you know what they call this?
What's happening here
is something enormous.
Old-fashioned, something
not suit to all anymore.
And this something has
a rare, precise name,
trust.
Let me say that one more time,
you're not betraying trust.
I think the Cheyenne,
I can have a very severe reaction.
Which sort of weapon are you interested in?
- One that hurts.
- Well, you come to the right place.
Let me show you something.
Yeah, you're looking at it.
The only pistol in the world that has the
power of a rifle, without all the bulk.
- I don't know the first things about a gun.
- I do.
That pistol here lets you shoot to
kill with precision from 250 feet.
And it doesn't just give you
the satisfaction of the kill,
it lets you kill with impunity,
which is a so different ball game.
Believe me, it's an extraordinary
thing to kill with impunity.
A rare shift in perspective
in a human being's lifestyle.
If we're licensed to be monsters,
we end up having just one desire...
truly being monsters.
- Hey, are you really Cheyenne?
- Sorry, what?
No, I'm just asking.
You're Cheyenne, right?
No, that's not me.
May I sit with you?
Oh, surely, sit down.
Are you... uh... traveling?
Sight-seeing.
- Oh, what exactly is the difference?
- I don't know exactly the difference.
But I always thought that
travelers were pain in the ass.
I feel the same way.
Death to the backpack.
That's a good model you have got there.
It's a nice balance between the
mechanics and... the storage capacity.
Are you in the luggage business?
We'll get to that.
But first, tell me the reason
you wanted to meet me.
I am looking for a German.
Well, you come to the right place.
Germans come here on vacation.
They love it here.
Reminds 'em of the Alps.
And when they go back home they
can say they've been to America.
I am looking for a different kind of German.
I'm looking for one who lives here,
whose name is Aloise Lange.
He was a friend of my father's.
I wanted to pay him a visit.
Do you know him?
We will get to that.
Now, do you remember back when
suitcases with wheels didn't exist?
You had to carry your bags
or lug them over your shoulder.
They're always so heavy. Everybody
were sweating and swearing all the time.
And then someone comes along...
it was really just a few years
ago if you think about it,
with the bright idea of
putting wheels on that thing.
And puff... all at once your
suitcase isn't heavy anymore.
And everyday I ask
myself the same question...
why didn't anyone think of it sooner.
Why do you ask yourself
the same question everyday?
Because I'm that someone
who had that bright idea.
- Are you playing on me?
- No.
I'll never do such a thing.
I'm Robert Plath.
I was a pilot with Northwest Airlines
and in 1988 I had an idea,
and so I tested it out in my garage,
and then I patented it.
And I won't call it a success...
because it was a revolution.
Now, there are 150 residents in Hunstville
and only one of them has a German accent.
He's pretty slight, and
his name isn't Aloise Lange.
He's Peter Smith.
He lives in a log cabin
on a hill heading east.
He's older than I am,
and more handsome, I think.
And I can't say that I
like this Peter Smith.
What's this about you, you do
not know if you're coming back?
I didn't get together with Desmond.
You're right. I know nothing about boys.
How are you?
Last night mom grabbed me my hand
And she said that pain is
not the final destination.
What I do understand is
that sometimes people leave.
My brother left.
And you left.
Do you hear me, Cheyenne?
I apologize. But it's the only
way you know I did it on purpose.
- Aw... How did you get in here?
- Who the fuck do you think I am?
You know I've spent most of my life
tracking down these bastards,
who were hiding themselves away
in hotels all over the world,
and you have the nerve
to ask me how I managed
to find my way into a tourist
motel in the middle of Utah.
- How did you know I was here?
- Ah... yeah. America is a tiny place.
It wasn't easy at first.
No rental car. No cell phone.
You know, I never have a cell phone and
I never remember you have a cell phone.
Well, what I'm gonna do? You're
a fuckin' pain in the ass.
It's a powerful feeling, but it's
softened a bit in your absence.
It's coming back in full force now.
Aloise Lange doesn't live here anymore.
He went away.
He doesn't go by the name
of Aloise Lange anymore.
He goes by the name of Peter Smith.
Oh fuckin' idiot. Now
you're a detective.
Pack your beauty case.
We get out of here.
- Where are we going?
- To the end of life,
exactly where your friend is.
- How do you know that?
- I know because my name is Mordecai Midler.
I know because I have a phone
and 1500 informants.
I pick it up and dial the
number and find people.
Now get your things.
I gotta go take a leak.
Hey Cheyenne, can you give me a hand?
This door... Goddammit, I think it's jammed.
- Are you kidding?
- No, no.
That fuckin' thing won't open.
Alright, do me a favor.
Call the guy at the reception
desk. He's got a master key.
No fuckin' way.
A detective like you who's flushed
out thousands of Nazi criminals
and you can't managed to
get yourself out of the john?
You gotta be kidding.
Why did you have to toss
bullshit on me at my age?
What fine air.
- Oh... this may seem trivial, but I...
- I was seven years old,
I saw the numbers on my father's forearm
and I asked him what
they were and he said...
I guess he said, I'm quoting,
"that's our telephone number."
That's why Jews always
dial the wrong number.
I spent most of my life
in hotel rooms, son.
Cheap inns inside a car.
Here and in Argentina, Brazil and Syria.
You know something?
I loved it.
And... even something else,
I am convinced that you'll like it too.
Because I am convinced that you're
in great need of distraction.
You're right, I liked it.
Yes, I thought so.
This place makes me feel so good.
The mountains make me
feel at peace with the world.
You know. It's like
putting on a necktie.
Can you even use that pistol?
How the fuck did you know I had a pistol?
Because I know.
Because I've been at war all my life.
Never ends.
One. Imitation.
Hitler had a private study,
2,000 square feet.
But he kept telling his
architect it was too small.
Goering built a house just like Hitler's.
Himmler would have like to have
a house just like Goering's.
Bormann would have like to have
a house just like Himmler's
if Himmler had managed
to build one like Goering's.
Everybody imitated anybody else.
Everybody but the Jews.
They didn't imitate anyone.
Two. Humiliation.
If you want to survive,
you have to really know the person who
is trying to kill you all the course.
I survived.
Your father tried to kill me for years.
You do the following episode.
In the winter, '43, during the roll-call.
He did something wrong.
I don't remember what, however,
but I threatened that the German
shepherd tear him to pieces.
The dog growled at him.
He was so scared...
he peed in his pants.
And I... burst out laughing.
That's what happened.
That was his humiliation.
Compared to the horrors
of Auschwitz, was nothing.
But your father never forgot it.
He used to write me letters.
He would say words most atrocious words,
most beautiful words.
Letters that my wife, who was a
cruel woman, would sent on to me.
By the way, she remembered you finally,
but not because you wee her student.
I hated your father
because his obsession for me
made my life impossible.
But I have to say...
that he completely won me over.
The unrelenting beauty of revenge.
The entire life dedicated to
avenging a humiliation.
That's what we call perseverance.
Greatness even.
Three. Theft.
The little bicycle. The stolen kiss
in the backyard when you're thirteen.
Black clouds.
The flu of approaching thunder.
The ticking of the clock.
Your mother's warm embrace,
Your father's smile and caress.
The finger trace on a foggy window.
The corner seat near the window.
The cozy blanket, when you got a fever.
The crystal clear Northern European sky.
Everyone, absolutely everyone,
was robbed of their youth.
Everyone, absolutely everyone,
have their youth stolen from them.
On the other side of the barbed wire,
we too... we too looked at the snow.
And... and God...
God is like...
God is...
God...
Don't mind it.
I can't remember anymore.
It's so unjust that my father
died before you.
Oh... shit!
Something's not quite right here.
I'm not sure what exactly.
But something.
Listen, I have to tell you something.
Your father loved you.
How do you know that?
He told me.
That's not true,
but it's nice of you to say.
Go on.
When during the inferno,
we too from the other
side of the barbed wire...
we too looked at the snow...
and at God.
That's how God is...
an infant in a stupefying form.
Beautiful, lazy, and still
with no desire to do anything,
like certain women who, when we were boys,
we only dared dream about.
