Rip by DanDee
Stop him!
Somebody stop him!
Asshole!
You Flemish asshole!
Fuck you!
Son of a bitch! Where were you?
I was followed.
Shut the fuck up.
- Step on it!
Get off my balls.
With your fisher's pouch.
You don't even know how to dress.
Are those shoes or paninis?
- Shoes, asshole.
They're white as whores.
Don't listen to that dickhead!
You see these fingers? See them?
Hey, Matti!
Missed you, bro!
Hey Marwan, you OK?
Hi guys.
You OK?
- Yeah.
You OK, Sindi?
If there's money, I'm there.
- Of course there is.
Of course there's money.
Woah, an iPhone!
Here, tampons for you!
Hey,
don't treat me like a kid.
Oh, there are cards. I'm good!
Visa? Can't use that.
- A Mastercard, guys.
Fuck me, you did well this time.
Police.
Quick, quick.
Take this, hide it.
Let's go.
- Quick, come on.
See you later.
Fuck, there's Mina.
She should calm down...
Nassim, Marwan.
Is there a problem, Mina?
No school today guys?
- No, it's a holiday.
Nice of your school.
Wish I had as much time off.
You know, Mina,
what you're doing isn't work.
I've had a complaint today,
a bag stolen from a car.
Know anything about it?
- Do you know anything?
No. You?
- We don't know anything, Mina.
Foreigners again?
- Yeah...
Bitch.
- What did you say?
Come on.
- I'm watching you.
Hey, tough girl!
What's your problem?
- Nothing.
I ask a question and you answer.
Leave her alone.
- No, but...
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Let her get on with her shit.
But she could tell us which guy
she likes the most.
Do you want a drag, sis?
Things OK with aunt Augustine?
Yeah.
He's moving!
Tell the brat to calm down
or I'll fuck his mother.
Or some cunt!
- I don't give a shit.
Guys, let's go.
New chick,
fix us some booze.
Yeah, it's over there.
Stop!
Yo, keep it cool with my bro!
I fucking hate cops.
Let me go.
- Don't push me, man.
Bastard. Son of a bitch.
Sit down and cut the bullshit.
- Fuck off you racist!
You, come with me.
Speak French.
- Shut up!
So tell me...
Why did you steal the bottles?
Marie-Evelyne...
Why did you steal the bottles?
Fuck you!
I was thirsty.
- You were thirsty.
And you couldn't pay for them?
Marie-Evelyne?
No.
You know, sir...
My mom's in prison,
so is my brother,
my dad is too,
and my sister,
even my aunt...
Crappy childhood, huh?
Well, guess what?
Your mom in prison is actually
on her way to pick you up.
You can wait for her outside.
Are you staring at me?
- Yep.
It's that outfit.
Should I be wearing a burqa?
Listen to you, you little whore.
You think I don't understand Dutch?
Faggot
Slut.
- Bastard.
Why are you here?
- None of your business.
What about you?
I found a Mastercard.
They don't believe me.
Did you buy your Nikes
with it?
No, I found them.
But on someone else's feet.
You're lucky.
With a great mug like mine?
Course I am.
Oh no, not her.
- Hi, Marwan. It's been a while.
When are you going to grow up?
Don't you want to be a man?
Why do you think it was us?
Someone saw you.
- Fuck you.
That's nice. We'll notify your parents
and we'll see...
What did she say?
I'll be a famous rapper someday
and she'll buy all my albums.
I'm lucky to talk to you then.
- Absolutely.
Let me have your number.
I want to see you again.
I don't go out with Moroccans.
We're all Africans.
So if your sister or cousin
came home with a black guy,
you wouldn't mind?
- It's not the same.
You're a girl, I'm a guy.
Marie-Evelyne!
Come here.
Here.
What did you do?
Nothing.
- Come along.
Princess, wait.
How long have you been cutting class?
- Mom...
Is that a carnival costume?
No, it's for the play.
Play? It's not a play,
it's a black women's circus.
An integration project in Dutch.
You think you'll get a job?
Your Dutch is crap.
Marie-Evelyne, enough.
But you've got a medical degree!
- I might meet some people.
Black graduates like you.
I won't waste my time
going to school.
This is our degree, our black skin.
It will always be like that.
With that attitude, sure...
At least, I try.
You should keep away from
your cousin and his scum.
They're my friends.
They respect me.
Respect you?
You don't even respect yourself.
Is that how I brought you up?
- Fuck off.
Ixelles police, open up!
Ixelles police!
- Hide the stuff.
It's fucking Don!
You prick, stop fucking around.
How's it going?
Where's the main man?
Hi, bro.
We dropped the goods 'cos of you.
Police my ass!
Out so soon?
Did you fuck a prison guard?
Careful what you say, man.
You, how are you?
Cool.
Mama Justelle.
Ma-ma Jus-telle.
- That's me!
Alright? How's it going?
There are girls here.
Who's that chick?
- She's my cousin.
Pretty cousin, bro.
- Thanks, but keep your hands off.
What do you mean?
Is this guy for real?
All girls in the gang
follow the rules, yeah?
Notorious, your cousin
is an exception...
for now.
Listen to me, you little bastard.
Your brother took the rap for you.
If I see your face in the street again,
you'll wish I hadn't.
OK?
- You stink.
Marwan.
It's OK, Mom, please.
So are you proud of yourself?
Think you and your brother are right?
On the right path?
Like you?
I'm not Flemish, dad.
Where is your brother?
I'm going down in for three months.
I had grass on me.
What will I do without you?
Don't worry,
three months go by real fast.
OK.
Three months in a detention center.
- It's too long.
These fucking cops,
they give us so much shit.
All that 'cos we're Moroccan!
- Fuck, you're not even Moroccan!
Shut the fuck up, Marwan,
son of a bitch!
Are you OK?
You could do so much better than him.
- Yeah?
Me, for example.
- Yeah.
Three months, I don't understand.
It was just grass.
It's too long.
- Don't worry.
It won't take long.
Let's move.
Hi, you!
You OK?
You OK?
- Yeah.
What's your name?
- Doris.
Doris, I like it.
Just looking at you, I feel like
there's something between us.
Air.
You're really pretty, I swear.
You're pretty too.
- Shut up. Hands off.
Shut it, you ugly bitch.
Watch your mouth.
I like girls with personality.
- You want some personality?
Alonzo!
Alonzo.
Got a problem?
- Me? No.
Get up.
- What?
Don't talk to her.
- I'm being polite.
I said don't talk to her.
Why?
- She's my girl.
I couldn't give a damn.
- Oh yeah?
I'll kick your head in.
You won't say that again.
She did this to me...
Shut your fucking mouth.
Are you crazy?
I'm going to fuck you up.
- I like girls like that.
Come on. Let's go.
Next time,
I'll smash your face in.
If I catch you, you're dead.
- Your slut's too ugly for me.
Screw you, niggers!
Run, get the others!
YOU like it, uh?
That's it, guys.
Notorious, hold him.
Yeah, show-off.
Shut the fuck up.
Son of a bitch.
Cops!
Do you know
the guys who beat up your friends?
No 'ma?
No idea.
I was reading a book.
- You, reading a book?
Yeah, Shakespeare.
It was nothing.
Just a bit of banter between friends.
I was looking the other way.
I heard sirens, I went to look
and now I'm here.
An accident at home.
I fell.
I wasn't fighting.
I bumped into a wall.
Black Bronx?
I don't even know who they are.
I suppose you saw nothing
in the metro?
Do you have a boyfriend?
- Why?
Just curious.
Listen, mister...
You're a bit old for me.
Your guy isn't in the gang
that we arrested?
I don't have a guy.
- You don't have a guy.
Here, call me whenever you want.
Did you know a girl
called Malou?
No?
You remind me of her.
The prettiest girl in her hood.
- Thanks.
She was young, intelligent, kind.
A real princess.
She had it all going for her.
Then, she started hanging out
with the wrong people.
I must have
a photo of her somewhere.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
How do you say that?
It's difficult.
You see? If you don't wear this cap,
you don't have any class.
Actually, guys like you kill class,
I swear.
And how's your head?
- Don't worry, it's nothing.
Marie-Evelyne, you shouldn't be
with those guys.
Firstly, it's Mavela.
I like them.
And your friends?
They fucked up Don's arm.
Six weeks in plaster.
- Jerking off will be difficult.
We're the 1080s.
A postcode?
- Yeah, and who are you?
The Black Bronx.
The Black Bronx!
We're not in Chicago, sweetheart.
Idiot, the Bronx is in New York.
New York, Chicago, it's all America.
What do I care?
I swear, it's sexy.
Wait, let me try.
Stop it.
So you can burp but not me?
- Not on purpose.
You're in the Black Bronx
and you feel bad when you burp?
You can't be serious.
But it was sexy.
Sexy? You like it?
- I love it.
You were classy but without the cap.
There, now you're classy.
Stop making fun of me.
- "I'm Marwan..."
Right now, for example,
you look classy.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
- Sure?
I have to go.
- Don't worry, stay.
If you're desperate to see me again,
let me know.
Pig headed cop.
- Did you see that?
The egg I ate this morning,
it was exactly the same thing.
You still got that black cop's card?
- Yeah.
Give it here.
- We gonna make a big joint of it.
You missed one, bro.
Right beside me, left, right.
I gave him that right up the ass.
Nassim. Fucker, that hurts!
Let go, you dick.
Give me five minutes with my brother?
I need to talk to him.
No problem.
Wait for me outside, buddy.
- OK.
How's it outside?
- OK.
Don't those guys piss you off?
- What?
It's better when you're there.
How's Loubna?
- She's doing good.
Take care of her.
- Of course.
You'd want to.
- Chill man.
Don't tell me to chill.
- I've got things sorted.
And your Miss Italy?
How's she?
Seriously, is she OK?
- When she's not a pain in the ass.
And she keeps her mouth shut.
What's the saying?
Ours is a great love story.
Wait, they're coming out.
Shit. They're here.
They've come out.
Are you ready?
- Go on then.
Fuck you, COPS!
Hey bro, need something?
Need something?
Want some grass?
Twenty?
How much?
- Twenty. Don't worry, it's good stuff.
Girls, come here a minute.
We need to talk.
Mr. Dominique is here.
You want dope all the time
and this is all you get for it?
One of my guys isn't working right now,
Mr. Dominique.
I'm going to send another guy.
You don't need to do that,
Mr. Dominique. I'll sort...
Mr. Koffi Kemba.
My young African friends.
We don't really have time
but we're gonna hurry.
With pleasure.
Who wants to take a picture?
Thank you.
Thank you, Brussels.
Can you feel the heat,
Brussels?
Can I have an autograph?
For my mom.
With pleasure.
What's her name?
- Augustine.
Enjoy the concert.
I'm off.
Mr. Koffi Kemba,
we'll be your security
for tonight.
I've already got security.
What security?
Trust me,
Mr. Koffi Kemba,
my guys and I will do
a much better job.
What happens if someone
shoots at the crowd?
Or if someone's killed?
It would be a terrible shame.
3.000 euro cash
and you won't have to worry tonight.
The entire night.
Take it or leave it.
I'll find the manager for you.
Good decision.
Can we hook up?
OK.
OK, boss? Five Jacks.
How are things, Mavela?
Drink?
- A coke.
A coke?
- Yes.
No, whiskey, boss. Add a shot of whiskey.
- A coke, please.
She'll have a whiskey.
A double.
She's cute, though.
What do you think, chief?
She's a pretty little thing.
With her little eyes. Cute.
I like her.
Let go of me.
Let go of me.
Leave her alone.
Not here, not now.
- Cool, baby, it's good.
Mavela! I want to show you something.
- I don't have much time.
I want to tell you something.
- It can wait. Come on!
Through here.
Let me help you.
Where are we going?
- Don't worry.
Go in.
I'm going to show you something.
Something amazing.
Look at that.
What's your wish?
Nothing.
It's just to keep her feet warm.
I thought you'd wished for us.
I came to tell you
that it's better we stop things now,
before we really go too far.
Do you understand?
Maybe you should leave
the Black Bronx?
I don't want to leave the Black Bronx.
You won't or you can't?
Come on.
Look, I made all this,
just for you.
But maybe you're right.
We should stop seeing each other.
Doris, are you OK?
Where's Alonzo?
- He's gone.
He's left the Black Bronx?
- It's over. He has someone else.
You really don't understand.
They're sons of bitches.
They fuck anything in a skirt,
and then dump us like shit.
When we do anything,
they never forgive us.
Come on, calm down.
Have a drag.
- No, I've got some pussy to take care of.
Alonzo.
Fuck off, bitch.
Alonzo...
You're going to leave me all on my own?
Will you come and see me?
I have to go.
Ream?
- Y es.
Mavela, be careful.
Be very careful.
It's not a game.
OK. Bye.
See the girl over there?
The waitress?
Isn't that the girl from...
- 1080.
Bring her to the apartment in an hour.
What are you going to do?
No questions, go on.
Can I sit here?
We've already met.
Me? No.
- Yes, it's you.
How old are you?
- Sixteen.
You've never had a boyfriend?
Never?
You don't go out?
- No.
Where's your burqa?
You're crazy.
I'm not joking.
- What?
I'm not joking with you.
- What do you mean?
Fancy a joint to chill out?
- I don't know.
A little one. You've been working hard,
you need to relax.
And then you can put that bag down.
- OK, quickly.
It's here.
Like it?
- It's crazy.
It's big, hey?
Wait there, I'll get the grass.
OK?
Are you lost?
Did you get lost?
What's going on?
Do you want to try a black dick?
Ever tried a black dick?
Get off me.
Get off her.
Stop!
Stop!
Please, stop!
Stop.
Please, stop!
Chill, you'll get used to it.
You're not afraid
she'll go to the cops?
The cops couldn't give a shit.
They know it's a gang thing.
Last year, one of the Black Justice
was stabbed.
Everyone knew who did it,
nobody gave a shit.
And if one day, you get attacked,
make sure you don't go to the cops.
You'll lose all our respect.
We'll get revenge for you.
Understood?
Are you OK?
Is there a problem?
Don't you have to rehearse?
Yes, but I wanted to know
if everything is OK.
Everything's fine.
Listen...
- Leave me alone.
Hello?
Shit, I looked all over for you.
What you doing?
I'm 'm town.
- In town?
Come over.
We're all waiting. Hurry up!
OK, I'm coming.
You OK?
Yeah. They leave me alone.
Good.
- Most of the guys here are OK.
How are things on the outside?
- Nothing special, same old.
Is mother OK?
Yeah, she says hi.
Fatima too.
Nassim,
I'm going to quit this life.
What?
Just like that?
You're in love.
I can see it in your face.
Got a new chick?
I want to make something out of my life.
- Doing what?
I don't know. Something with cars.
- You're going to steal cars?
No, maybe be a mechanic.
You want to own a garage?
- Why not?
A real garage owner
with overalls and a cap.
"Hello there. Hi."
Seriously?
- Yeah.
I know some guys
who can get you some cars to sell.
You can meet Pitchy.
- I want an honest business.
What, a nine to five?
A tidy little life, something clean?
Then claim welfare.
That's also honest and you earn more.
I don't want to do this shit
my whole life.
What?
You think I'm shit as well?
I'm here for you, aren't I?
If you become Flemish,
then what?
Forget it.
Listen up, bro.
You were born here,
but you're still different.
You'll always be a foreigner,
period.
Hello?
X, get over here. Some sons of bitches
are loitering on our turf.
You see, it's chill.
What are you doing?
- Gardening.
You're on our turf.
- Nah, this is Black Panthers' turf.
Didn't they tell you in lock up?
This is our turf now.
Look at the little guy.
He's grown balls,
he's taller, he talks too much
and he's starting
to threaten his superiors.
You know what?
Fuck off, you bitch.
Bitch?
Who's the bitch now?
Who?
Let's go, man.
They've been in there
ever since the IRA attack in 2008.
This war in this region started
almost 300 miles away,
in Uganda, in the late 1980s.
Since then, the scale of atrocities
has been apocalyptic.
An estimated 100,000 people
have died in this conflict.
More than 20,000 children
were abducted.
Where've you been?
- At my mom's.
Where are the others?
- Gone out.
Justelle's asleep.
You're sure you were at your mom's?
- Yes.
Are you lying?
I swear.
Loubna, pass me the joint.
Loubna, pass me the joint.
You OK?
Sure?
You look like a zombie.
Yeah.
- See?
Oh, what an ass.
Hey, cute ass?
Marwan, did you see?
- What?
What's up with you?
Now you're with Sindi,
you can't look at ass anymore?
I do what I want.
She's not my mother.
There's no more love?
- Love? There never was any.
You've broken up?
Come on, what happened?
You're not with her anymore?
No.
Then let me have her, for a night.
- She's all yours.
Seriously?
- Yeah.
Cool, man.
- Brothers share everything.
The two buffoons are here.
Everything OK?
What's that?
A present.
- I did a little something today.
I stole it.
- You did what?
It was me.
- You stole it?
It was me that stole it.
Why you laughing?
There's a cellphone. I want that.
We'll call mom tonight.
In Morocco.
- Let's see that wallet.
Wait.
Are you serious? A 70 year-old grandma?
You fuckers.
What?
- She is 70, you son of a bitch.
Seriously?
You stole a bag from on old woman?
You told me...
- Shut the fuck up.
But he told me.
- Calm down, calm down.
Since when are you so politically correct?
- Shut the fuck up.
Since when do you use
words like that?
I'm off, see what's happening.
- Are you moving?
Get back here now.
Fuck, that old one still looks good.
Where's she going?
What are you doing here?
- You left, so I thought...
Where're the others?
- Still in Molenbeek.
My parents aren't home
this weekend.
Sindi, please.
You don't want to fuck anymore?
Have you lost your balls?
Stop it.
Who's the fucking necklace for?
- No one.
You found another slut?
Fuck off.
Bastard.
I want to get far away from here, I swear.
- Me too.
If you had to choose a destination,
which one?
Ghent
- That's shithole. I'd choose Paris.
Thank you.
Wait, I'll go put it on.
Can I?
Are you thirsty?
I'm off to find something
in the night shop.
Be quick.
Waiting for someone?
- Why are you here?
"Why are you here?"
What about you?
Nothing.
- Nothing? That's funny, us too.
A Black Bronx chick doesn't fuck
outside the gang.
Fuck her.
Do it!
Shut it, bitch!
Fuck.
How's it going, Mina? Cheetos?
Don't touch me.
Calm down.
I want to leave the Black Bronx.
You can't leave the Black Bronx.
I don't give a shit.
- It's for them to decide.
Hi, beautiful.
I thought you'd like it if
we went back together instead of alone.
Let's go.
Don, actually...
- What?
Do you need to take something home?
My mom?
- What about her?
Enough about your mom,
leave her in peace.
You want me to go and speak to her?
Give me your cellphone.
Come on.
Read this and sign it.
Sit down. Sit down!
You're not getting off that easily.
I've warned you, Marwan.
I'll make sure this was
the last time you've stolen.
The last time, get it.
You can go.
Mavela?
Mavela doesn't want to see you.
She's found someone else.
Speak to her? No, I don't think so.
Fuck!
Mavela.
Come here, I said.
Sit down.
If you try and see
that Moroccan son of a bitch again.
You know what I'll do to him?
Got it?
You bitch!
It's your fault!
- Marwan, enough!
It's OK.
Things will be fine. Calm down.
What happened?
What's wrong?
What's wrong, Marwan?
They've got my girlfriend.
- Who has?
Her gang, the Black Bronx.
It's your fault, Mina.
So that's it?
After everything I've done for you,
you want to go without saying goodbye?
Leave her alone.
Next time,
watch out.
Or we'll do the same thing
to your mom. Understand?
Or not?
David.
David, listen to me.
If anything happens to Marie-Evelyne,
I'll kill you with my own hands.
Whether you're family or not.
You won't screw up her life
like you screwed up your mother's.
Do you understand, you little shit?
There's nothing left to drink.
I have an idea.
Say sorry.
Say sorry. Say sorry.
Say sorry, you bitch.
Didn't you owe us something?
Give us the cash.
Empty your register. Now!
Quick. There's no time!
Mavela!
Please,
tell me what's happened, Mavela.
I haven't seen you for ages.
I don't want to see you again.
Why won't you say anything?
I love you.
What do I have to do to prove it?
Our room's been trashed.
What happened?
No idea.
Anyway, where were you?
- With the cops.
Let me out.
Not until you answer me.
What are you doing?
Marwan, you're insane!
What happened, Mavela?
- Stop.
I love you, OK?
- I don't love you!
You're lying.
- Marwan, stop.
Nobody, nothing will stop me
from being with you. I don't give a fuck!
They raped Loubna.
Who?
My gang-
I had to get her to the apartment.
You're lying. You didn't...
Tell her I'm sorry.
And I know what it's like.
I have something to say.
Our sister Mavela
has come back tonight.
She's shown everyone
that she's a real Black Bronx chick.
Speech.
Speech.
Black Bronx.
Black Bronx for life.
Hello?
- It's Mavela.
Hi, Mavela. Are you OK?
What's wrong?
Want to come to the station
and tell me?
Are you crazy?
If they see me back there...
Nobody will see you.
Trust me.
His name's Don.
And this one?
His name's Notorious.
- Notorious?
He wasn't there during the rapes?
He wasn't there.
When are you going to get them?
Give me until tomorrow night.
In the meantime, make sure
you're in X's apartment,
so we can arrest you all together.
I have to go back there?
These arrests
happen early in the morning.
Why not right now?
You all must be
in the same place at the same time
and we arrest you with them,
so nobody suspects anything.
Mavela, I'm asking you
to hold on a bit longer.
And I swear to God
I'll get you out of there.
Hello, Mr. Dominique.
Hello.
Well done, good work son.
It's time to ramp things up a gear.
I'll introduce you
to some important people.
Now?
- Let's not waste any time.
Thanks, Mr. Dominique.
You can trust me in future.
There won't be any more mistakes, I swear.
I have some ideas.
X, the guy you're going to meet
is like me.
An African mafia boss.
You need to show him
plenty of respect, understand?
Of course, Mr. Dominique.
Of course.
Hi, bitch!
What am I going to do?
I don't give a fuck.
You got her pregnant...
I knocked her up and then basta.
I've already got another chick.
- I know. You're a prick.
X, get up.
Hey, son of a bitch.
Who is it? Stop him.
Stop filming.
Call an ambulance, fuck.
Go fuck yourself.
How's it going, big man?
- You OK?
Fuck, you look good.
- Sweetheart.
It's great to see you again.
- Thanks.
A real criminal.
You've grown.
- Go on, fly.
What? You're not happy to see me?
- No, it's not that.
You've gained weight, bro.
I knew you had a new girl.
What's going on?
You swap them like undies.
- And him? He takes my leftovers.
No, you're the bitch.
You're a bitch.
- No, I'm not.
Say it.
- OK, I'm a bitch.
Shut the fuck up, you prick.
Hey, bro.
You know, I missed you.
- I missed you too.
You OK?
Want me to take you home?
- OK.
Want me to come too?
No.
Chill, man.
- What do you mean, chill?
What?
What's up?
Don't worry, we'll get him.
Calm down.
We'll get him, promise.
- Stop drinking like that.
What's the problem?
What's going on?
Who's Mavela?
Who is Mavela?
Nassim, chill, man!
Chill, man! Calm down.
- Who is she?
What are you doing, man?
Leave him be.
Stay out of it!
Nassim, he's your brother!
Don't fuck around!
Fuck, Nassim!
Call your black bitch!
Go see her, now!
Not tomorrow,
not next week,
but now.
- No.
I'll kill you if you don't do it.
See what I'm gonna do?
Who is it?
Show me.
Pick up. Put him on speaker.
Get a move on!
Pick up. Do it now!
Hello?
Hi, Mavela, it's me, Marwan.
I want to see you.
OK.
North Station in 30 minutes.
- North Station in 30 minutes.
I love you.
What did I say if you saw
that Moroccan bastard again?
You think I've got no balls?
What did I fucking say?
Let's go, move it!
Stay here.
Notorious...
Watch her.
Come here.
You walk to the North Station.
We'll go by tram.
Matti, follow him.
No bullshit.
Do you understand me?
Now go.
Notorious, please,
let me out.
Notorious,
at least give me your cellphone.
You know what's going to happen,
you can't do that.
Think about our moms.
What they'll think of us.
I'm begging you,
give me your cellphone.
I'm begging you.
Do what you have to do.
Everyone knows this lot.
We've dealt with them many times before.
Hello?
Let me out!
- Fuck, it's too dangerous!
Please. I know you.
I know you're not a bad guy.
Let me get out.
Think about our moms.
Yours, mine!
Have you forgotten
you're the reason I'm here?
Let me out
of the fucking car, now!
We need an ambulance
at North Station!
Three wounded, quick!
