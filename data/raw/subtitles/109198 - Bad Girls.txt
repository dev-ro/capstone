Anita!
Coming.
Come on, sweetie!
Open the door!
I’ve been saving up for you
for a long time.
Come on, honey!
I’m a-waitin'!
- Happy birthday, Colonel.
Oh, darlin', darlin'!
No, no, no.
All right, let's raise the flag
on the flagpole today, huh?
You know the rules:
no side arms upstairs.
Getting a birthday kiss, yeah.
Take off your coat.
- Come on, darlin'.
- A toast.
A toast?
Yeah, give me a drink. Sure.
- Oh, you're such a pig.
- Ah, yeah! Oink, oink, oink!
- Here's to one year better.
- One year better and one year older.
Now, darlin',
what do you say, huh?
Where's the center of your charms?
Come on! Come on!
- I might get bruises.
- I’m gonna run after you, all right.
Come here. Come here.
Take that off.
Ooh.
- Kiss me.
- Oh, no.
- I want that kiss!
- You don't wanna mess with me.
Where you goin'?
- There they go again.
- What the hell’s going on?
# Yes, we'll gather at the river #
# The beautiful, the beautiful river #
# Gather with the saints
at the river #
# That flows by the throne of God. #
God-fearing citizens
of this fine town,
ain't it about time
we stop letting the sad morality
of a pernicious few sinners
bring shame upon us all?
Amen!
Time to put a stop
to the drinkin'...
-... and the gamblin'
and the whorin'
right under our very noses!
Hey, preacher, you come up here.
We think we might
could change your mind.
A man's entitled to a drink
every once in a while.
My father, he'd have
his drink on Saturday night
and he'd work hard all week long.
There's nothing wrong with that.
You see, it says in the Bible...
Give me two cards.
- Two, I want two.
You had two already.
Whoa! Hold on there!
Where you goin'?
We ain't finished yet.
I ain't even got
my birthday kiss yet.
You gonna plan on robbing me of it?
Come on, now.
I’m gonna take you.
- It's all right. Come on.
- Come on, darlin'.
Yep, that's the one I wanted.
- Oh, boy!
You stay away from me!
Cody! Cody! Cody!
- Cody!
- Damn whore!
Now, keep your hands
off her, Colonel.
I paid for a goddamn
birthday kiss!
I’m gonna get one!
You touch her again,
you're a dead man.
She shot him!
The whore shot the colonel!
Get her! Harlot!
Get her!
She shot the colonel!
She shot him!
Get her! Get her!
# With the cross of Jesus #
# Going on before #
# Christ, the royal Master #
# Leads against the foe #
# Forward into battle #
# See His banners go... #
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Oh!
The good Lord sayeth
an eye for an eye, a life for a life.
Lord, let this Jezebel
be damned to death!
Harlot, you cannot escape
the wrath of our Lord.
I accuse you of harlotry.
I accuse you of destroying
the sanctity of marriage.
I accuse you of bringing sin
and disease to this town.
You have blackened the sun
and bloodied the moon.
I accuse you of having a scorpion
between your legs
that destroys
man's covenant with God!
Cleanse yourself with death!
Free yourself
from your sinful enslavement!
Just get on with it.
Then let us pray.
O God, Jesus has said
every tree is known by its fruits.
This woman has
brought forth bad fruit,
- And we pray unto you today, Lord...
... to bless us as we rid
our fair community of this woman,
this abomination,
this scarlet temptress
who is ruining our town.
I say unto her
the day of wrath is at hand.
Hyah!
Hah!
- Yah!
Hah!
Seems more like a lifetime
than three years.
I’m not exactly...
your blushing bride anymore.
I know you don't hold it
against me, but I do.
At least I never let
another man kiss me.
I’ll always have you in my heart.
If nothing else,
at least that's sacred.
Let's go.
If we don't put ground
between us and Echo City,
we won't be going anywhere.
Hey there.
We're with the Pinkerton
Detective Agency.
I wonder if you can help us.
We're looking for
a Miss Matilda Clayborne.
That's her in the buggy.
Thank you.
I'll tell ya,
they are way the hell
out of my jurisdiction by now,
Mrs. Clayborne.
Chappy, if you were anything more
than a pile of manure
with a badge on it,
my colonel might still be alive.
Well, I didn't put no gun
to your mister's head
and make him jump that whore.
Bitch.
We came as soon
as we got the wire, ma'am.
- Sorry about your husband.
- You're wasting time.
I’m hiring you because what passes
for the law around here
won't leave this jurisdiction.
I want that filthy harlot killed
or brought back to me,
no matter what.
I had these drawn up.
And that's just a taste
of what you'll get
when you bring her back here.
Sonny, do you want to get
our mounts off the horse car
at the back of the train?
- Yes, sir.
- Don't you worry, ma'am.
You just point us
which way they went.
We'll track 'em all right.
- Okay, lift it. Higher.
Okay, ease it down.
That should do it.
The wagon!
You all right, sweetpea?
- Yah!
Hyah!
Yah!
Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, now.
Whoa.
Well, might as well eat this, too.
You can't tell the one meat
from the other.
Yeah, just like men.
So, are we gonna find
another saloon somewhere?
I’m finished with that.
So am I.
What do you got there?
Is that a stock certificate?
It’s a homesteader's claim
to 640 acres
in the Oregon Territory.
Jim and I had it together.
It’s what we came out west for.
- What's it worth?
- A lot of hard work.
And then what you got?
A farm, unless the bank takes it away.
We were gonna start a sawmill.
- A sawmill?
- Yeah.
All the settling out here now
means more schools and saloons,
churches, houses
that means lumber.
Now, how come you never
told us about this before?
I don't know.
I didn't know how I was gonna
do it all by myself.
What I mean to say is,
I'd like it if you all
would go in with me.
Together we could do it.
We could run a business.
A sawmill?
We sold our bodies.
Why can't we sell some wood?
Might as well go ahead
and cook that thing some more.
- It ain't gonna hurt to burn it none.
- I suppose not.
Takes money.
- Building a sawmill takes money.
- I know.
I’m probably just dreaming,
but it's the closest thing
to a plan we've got.
Well, it could be I got some.
In Agua Dulce.
Been wiring it there for years.
Over $12,000 now.
What? Two
- What are you saying?
- I’m saying a sawmill
Why the hell not?
Yeah. Why the hell not?
Ooh!
A sawmill.
Ugh.
Well, as long as I don't have to get
any splinters in my fingers.
Oh, Eileen.
This stuff's... raunchy.
That's why they call it rotgut.
Oh, it hits you quick.
Whoa.
Maybe a day old.
They was pullin' a wagon.
If it don't rain,
it won't be hard pickin' 'em up.
Yah.
- Morning, ma'am.
Now, don't go firing that thing.
I just wanna show you something.
I must say the likeness
doesn't do you justice.
Yeah, that's me, all right.
My name's McCoy,
Joshua McCoy.
Where are you headed, Mr. McCoy?
I’m a prospector, see?
These hills are too picked over.
I thought I’d make my way up north.
I've seen prospectors.
You don't look like a prospector.
Well, I am.
Truly I am.
I’m counting on making
a big strike soon
as soon as I get
some things taken care of.
Now, you wouldn't be thinking
this reward here
would be part of your stake,
would you?
No, ma'am. I'm just riding
in the same direction as you.
All right. Put on your hat
and be on your way, Mr. McCoy.
Only if you put your clothes on.
- Get movin'.
- Ma'am.
One more thing.
They put Pinkertons on your trail.
You'd best keep moving.
Pack everything on horseback.
We're leaving the wagon.
- What about all our things?
- Leave 'em.
We gotta be in Agua Dulce
by tomorrow.
- Yes, may I help you?
- Yeah.
I wanna buy a dress.
Um, just what kind of dress
did you have in mind?
One of them ready-to-wear kind
like you see in that Sears catalogue.
I really think a woman like you
would be happier
shopping someplace else.
Yah, come on!
Come on. Hyah!
Ooh!
Morning, ma'am.
Good day, Mr. Landaker.
- I believe you dropped this, madam.
- Why, thank you, sir.
- My pleasure.
- I’m new here.
If it wouldn't be
too much trouble,
could you suggest
a respectable place
where I might have a meal
and a decent libation?
Now, I just might know
of such a place.
How dare you cast such lewd
and salacious aspersions
upon my person!
But... that might be interesting.
Eileen, you don't gotta
whore yourself
with the first old fart
that comes along.
- Silly child!
- Tramps, the both of you!
Aw, Lilly!
Can't you tell I was just trying
to get something passable to eat?
Oh, yeah?
And I’m Wyatt Earp.
- Can I have a kiss, Wyatt Earp?
- Don't you pucker up to me, Eileen.
Come on. Come on.
- Mm!
Eileen.
Well...
How can I help you, madam?
I would like to close out
my account.
Pardon me,
I don't believe I know you.
You have an account with us?
Oh, yes.
I set it up six years ago
and I’ve been wiring deposits
ever since.
Miss Annalee Zamora.
Please come in, Miss Zamora.
- Thank you.
- Just have a seat right over there.
Now, then,
if you don't mind,
could I just take a look
at your bank book?
Oh!
Oh, I'm afraid
there's a bit of a problem.
You see, we had a fire,
and it was terrible.
I just well, I really can't say.
I do recall signing something
some time ago.
You must have my signature
on file somewhere.
- I’ll be right back.
- Thank you.
What are you doing here?
- We're with the Pinkerton
- I can see that.
We're following a harlot,
name of Cody Zamora.
She killed a fella
up in Colorado Territory.
She's riding with
a bunch of other whores.
Yep, these are some bad girls.
This one rode in
this morning with three others.
It’s very unusual to carry
an account like this.
Some considerable funds
in your account.
$12,432, I believe.
Why, yes.
A little more with the interest.
How lovely.
- Cody!
- Hold on! You can't go in there!
- Not now.
- You gotta listen to me.
- See here, young lady
- This is my sister
- Lilly, get!
- She belongs to you, does she?
It’s all right, Jenkins.
- It’s all right.
- Yes, sir.
I am so sorry.
My sister, she's a little...
Anita, those Pinkertons,
they're here.
Come on, come on.
Here you go.
Cody, Cody, the Pinkertons
are coming!
Wrong, darlin'.
The Pinkertons are here.
Miss Zamora,
if you'd come with me.
Get her.
Come on.
- Get off of me!
- Uh!
Cody!
Ah!
- Ah!
- Get up!
Drop the gun.
Drop it.
You, too.
- Move it.
Inside!
- Move!
- That's far enough, fat man.
- Come here. Open that door!
- Yes, sir.
- Come on, come on!
- Get in there! You heard him.
Cody?
Well, kiss my sister's
black cat's ass!
What the hell are you doin' here?
I’m making a withdrawal.
So are we, darIin'.
How much you takin' out?
Give the lady her money,
fat man.
Move it!
- Thanks, Kid.
- For old times.
Boss! We got it all.
Let's ride.
Come on.
Move!
Let's go.
Let's get outta here now!
Come on, Eileen.
Ho, ho!
Eileen, get your behind
on that horse.
What the hell
do you think I’m trying to do?
You know where to find me, darlin'.
You son of a bitch!
- Shit!
- Eileen!
- Yah!
- Come on, Eileen!
- Hyah!
- Yah!
Stop!
Cody!
Come here!
Come here, you tramp!
Get your hands off me!
You're up to something,
you little tart!
- Damn it!
- Stand still!
You. William Tucker.
- I'm deputizing you.
- I gotta get on back to my place.
Yeah, well, I gotta form a posse
and get after them stinkin' Jarretts.
Now, you put that down
and take her over and lock her up.
Think you can do that, Deputy?
- I heard you twice the first time.
- Well, then, goddamn it, do it!
Earl, show him the way
and then get yourself fixed up.
Yeah, all right, boss.
All right, who's gonna
volunteer for the posse?
Come on, we gotta get 'em
before they cross the river.
I’ll go, Marshal.
A damn stranger's
the only one on you with guts?
It’s your damn money they stole.
You just gonna stand there and take it?
All right, that's better.
Let's mount up.
- You feel like a big man?
- I feel like my damn shoulder hurts.
Why don't you sit down?
Act like a lady.
Tucker, watch her.
I’m going to the damn doctor.
- William?
- Yes, ma'am.
Come closer.
Please?
- Do I look like a criminal?
- No, ma'am.
- I ain't no bank robber.
- I ain't no deputy.
Why don't you just let me go?
I’d like to.
I really would.
But I can't.
I’m sorry.
Ma'am, you shouldn't oughta
carry on like that.
Oh, God...
Now, you'll see,
when the marshal gets back,
- He'll straighten everything out.
Whoa.
We ain't gonna follow 'em?
We ain't the law over there.
We go back.
Are we gonna get her out?
- Are we gonna get Eileen?
- How are we gonna do that?
I don't know, but we got you out
when they were gonna lynch you.
Well, now, that was lucky.
Look, I don't let my friends get hung.
I want her out just as much as you.
They're not gonna hang her,
so rest easy.
Do nothing? Shit.
I'm going to Kid Jarrett.
I figure he's our best chance.
Kid Jarrett's our best chance?
That son of a bitch
was nothing but trouble to you.
That was a long time ago.
Yeah, and this morning
all he did was steal our money.
That's Kid's way of inviting me
to come over and see him.
Hell of an invitation.
Look, you don't know him.
He's bored.
He'll give us back our money
and spring Eileen from jail
just for the hell of it.
You're rating yourself
awful high, Cody.
I ran with that gang.
I know what I’m doing.
- Where the hell are you going?
- With you to Kid Jarrett's.
You don't go anywhere near the Jarretts.
Do you understand me?
- I’m going with you, Cody.
- I’m warning you. You stay put.
You don't do what I tell you,
you're both out.
Hey!
New Orleans.
My daddy had a big house
in the Quarter.
That's the French Quarter.
- Parlez français?
- Excuse me?
It’s French.
It’s the language of love,
you know.
I didn't know the language
of love had words, ma'am.
Oh, my, yes.
- I could teach you.
- Huh?
French
I could teach you French.
Oh. Of course.
So you're a rancher?
I got a couple dozen head
of longhorns.
- Cattle rancher.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Nearby?
- Why, yes.
Actually, about 16 miles
out on North Road.
It’s a beautiful piece of land.
It’s called the Circle Bar T.
- Circle Bar T?
- Yes, ma'am.
It’s a nice name.
Rico!
- You cannot come here, señorita.
Cody Zamora.
Hola, señorita!
You here to keep the boys happy?
It’s been a long time, Cody.
- It’s been a long time, Frank.
- Yeah.
Kid said you were back in Texas.
He tell you he stole my money?
- He said you'd be coming.
- Damn right.
That money is our stake for a new start
in the Oregon Territory.
- Yours and whose, darlin'?
- Me and some friends.
One of us got
a homesteader's claim.
Oregon.
Heh, I ran there once.
Now, why didn't I see you
at the bank?
I got what I need right here.
- Well, Kid's still hungry.
- Yeah.
Thinks he can make
a bigger name for himself
than his old man.
Always did want
what I had, didn't he?
Well, look who's here.
We got us some talking to do, Kid.
Let's talk.
See you around, Frank.
Playing with the big guns now, Kid?
You know I always did like
playing with things.
Mm-hmm.
Taking trains too, I see.
Military shipment.
Selling US army guns to Juarez.
It’s funny what you can find out
when you're running panocha
to the army colonels
over at Fort Clark.
Right, Jack?
By Friday I’ll be up to my ass
in Mexican gold.
- I'll bet you will.
- So what's on your mind?
- You invited me.
Didn't you wanna come?
For the old days.
Remember when we went ridin'
with that bunch down Tucson,
runnin' those guns into Durango?
You remember that?
We had us some times, didn't we?
You lyin' bitch.
You've just come here
for your money.
Oh, now, what's the difference, Kid?
You're gonna be up to your ass
in Mexican gold by Friday, right?
That's right.
What's $10,000 one way or the other?
$12,432.
Why don't you just give it to me
and I'll be on my way?
Look, I was only playing with you.
You can have your money.
Keep the change.
Thanks, Kid.
What makes you think Oregon's
gonna be any different, hmm?
A new start for an old whore.
Why don't you just say it, Kid?
You're still sore at me
for running out on you.
Now, why would I be sore?
Hmm?
Because you ran out on me
in the middle of the night
without saying a word, hmm?
I’ll see you around.
- She ain't comin' back.
- She is so.
I'm going to get Eileen.
Are you with me or not?
When Cody comes back
and we're not here
Don't worry about it.
She'll wait.
Yah!
Lilly.
Don't hurt me.
There's no chance of that.
Electric chair!
If you ask me,
it'd be a hell of a lot cheaper
just to hang 'em.
That way you can use the rope
over and over again.
- What's that?
- Huh?
There.
That's that whore.
- That ain't her.
- You're drunk.
- She's been beaten.
- Here.
- Can you help her?
- Here.
- How bad?
Her back, I think.
Aw, hell, why we gotta walk
all the way the hell down here for?
Because she's in one of these tents.
- I seen her.
- You ain't seen her.
I say we go right across the street
and get our bell ropes pulled.
Man, I thought we were off duty.
We ain't ever off duty.
Psst, hey, fellas.
You those fellas after that whore
from Echo City?
What's it to you?
You seen her?
Well, now, that depends.
That poster talked about a reward?
Could be there's a real big reward.
Could be I know
where that whore is right now.
- Where'd that be?
- Where'd that reward be?
$500 wired to you
when we get her.
My word as a "Peckerton detinctive."
$500 is more than I’m used to.
All right.
I seen that whore Cody
riding upriver not an hour ago.
Hell, why didn't you do something?
- She's with Kid Jarrett.
- You sure it were Kid Jarrett?
Yeah, sure enough.
I’d have done something, too,
but I ain't no Peckerton detinctive.
Hell! Cody Zamora
and Kid Jarrett.
Gunpowder heal wound.
Okay. Okay.
It’ll be all right.
It’ll be all right.
Tucker?
- Yeah, what do you want, Earl?
- Get out here, Tucker.
- What are you doin'?
- Interrogating the prisoner.
Well, you ain't trained for that.
I’ll take over.
I’m making some real good
headway there.
Your ranch is waiting on you, boy.
Well, I expect that can wait
a good while longer.
Now, I been talking to her.
She ain't no bank robber.
In fact, she's a real fine lady
from New Orleans.
- Tucker, you go home now.
- Um, I’m turning myself in.
- Say what?
I was with the gang
that robbed the bank.
I can't take it anymore.
Maybe you ought to sit down.
Eileen.
- It’s about damn time.
- Here, tie this on.
Y'all don't know how hard it is...
bein' hunted,
men wantin' you
everywhere you go.
I just wanna be safe.
What are you doin' standing here?
Go and question the prisoner, son.
- William?
- Yes'm.
- How would you like to kiss me?
- Excuse me?
First... they hurt me right there.
Mm.
And then...
they hurt me right there.
Mm mm mm mm.
Ma'am, those may be severe injuries,
but I don't see any marks.
Perhaps if you just
move it up a little bit.
- Oh!
Shit!
Damn it! Damn it!
Damn it!
- Well, I’ve got more injuries.
- Show me later.
Getting me out in the middle
of something, uh!
Oh, oh.
Look, here's your chance
to be a big hero
to someone in real trouble.
I swear on my honor
as a Southern lady.
- Get out of my way.
- Hang on.
Look, I didn't have anything
to do with that robbery.
You're just gonna
have to believe me.
- Move!
- Please, William.
I don't know why
I believe you, but I do.
- You're doing the right thing.
- Yeah, sure.
- Come on, get out.
- And you know what?
- For your own good.
- Hey! No, wait! Hang on, now!
You're just gonna
have to wait in there.
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you, William.
You tell them that we held
a gun to your head.
- Eileen, come on.
- Let's go.
You take care, William.
Let's get the hell outta here.
Come on.
He was trying
to make me eat beans.
Whoa, boy.
Yah.
Hold up. Hold up.
- Cody's horse.
- See if you can find her.
We'll be at the Circle Bar T.
- 16 miles.
- Okay.
- Up the road next to Turtle Creek.
- Got it.
- Let's go.
- Whoa.
Don't worry, mister.
Wife be okay.
Thank you.
Well, Mr. McCoy...
you seem to be my lucky penny.
It weren't no accident
I was in Echo City
or that I tracked you here.
Word was you had a history
with the Jarretts.
I told you I was a prospector.
That's all true.
I’m on my way to the Klondike.
Got a claim there that could be
worth a fortune in gold.
But first, I got an old score
to settle with Frank Jarrett.
He jumped my father's claim
and he killed him.
And my ma was done like
like you was.
She lived on a couple of years.
I swore on her grave
I’d live to see Frank Jarrett die.
So you figured that Jarrett's whore
might lead you back to him?
Yes, ma'am.
That was the truth of it.
I didn't get our money.
Circle Bar T, all right.
This is big.
Ha... this ain't so big.
This used to all be free-range.
The law of the land was cattle
could go where they pleased.
You see that barbed wire?
That gave small ranchers like Tucker
a chance to get started
without being overrun
by the cattle from the big outfits.
You know, folks say the West
was conquered by the railroad.
Uh-uh.
My daddy says it was conquered
by barbed wire.
Well, you sure know
a Iot about this
for a fine Southern lady
from New Orleans.
Oh, Lilly, I ain't
from New Orleans.
I’d like to have been.
I grew up on an East Texas
grub ranch,
not much different than this one.
Well, I don't know much
about grub ranches,
but this sure looks nice
to me, Eileen.
It’s got possibilities.
Well, ain't this sweet?
Little boy's gonna rob
an army choo-choo.
Gonna get himself
a big new toy gun, huh?
That gun's gonna
make me rich, old man.
Oh, hi, William.
I hope you don't mind.
I kinda helped myself
to a few things.
I’ve... I’ve made a really nice stew.
I wouldn't go in there if I was you.
Our friend's restin' in your bed.
It sure is nice of you
to let us stay here, Mr. Tucker.
Most kind.
Now, wouldn't you like some stew?
- And I’ve made some pies.
- Sure smells good.
Hi. Joshua McCoy.
You got a real nice
spread here, William.
That's just great.
Why don't y'all just
make yourselves at home?
I’ve been alone out here
going on a couple of years...
since my family died.
I reckon you're the first company
I’ve had out here.
And I guess I wouldn't be
much of a man
if I wasn't at least hospitable.
Welcome to my home.
The population
of the United States
is over 63 million people now.
Well, they sure ain't here.
- Better let you get some rest.
- No, you can stay.
Well, I suppose I don't
wanna be alone.
That's funny?
It’s funnier than you know.
I suppose I’d like to stay.
May I have the pleasure
of a dance?
Oh, I don't know.
Come on, you're not gonna
turn me down, are you?
I... I don't do
a lot of dancin' out here.
I feel kinda silly.
You boys are making me very angry.
Now, let's not be shy
and do what I told you.
That's it.
You boys are gonna be famous.
Tell your grandchildren
you got held up by Kid Jarrett.
Here...
Don't Iook so sad, boys.
You look good in your drawers.
You fools be careful with that thing!
That's precious cargo
we've got there.
Shit! It’s okay, boss!
Hyah! Hyuh!
Hah!
Now.
Up in the hills!
What the hell are you doing, Jack?
Get this wagon outta here!
Okay, boss!
Come on.
Get! Whoa!
Where are you going, Jack?
Aah!
God damn you, Roberto!
Come back here and fight!
Yuma! Roberto!
You yellow dogs!
Get back here!
- Damn!
Uh!
Aah!
- Ned! Ned!
Ned, where are you going?
- Hyah, hyah.
Anita!
Get your yellow asses
back here, you cowards!
Oh, God.
- Can you get up?
- Yeah.
Yah!
Hyah!
Yah, yah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
You dumb-ass!
It ain't nothin' but Cody
and a bunch of women!
Ha! Better go find
your toys, sonny!
- Yah.
Where do you think you're going?
Jarrett, you asshole!
The name of the man
who's killing you is Joshua McCoy.
- Don't mean spit to me, boy.
Josh, they got Lilly.
Kid's got Lilly.
Cody...
Bring him along.
We'll trade him for Lilly.
I'm sorry, boss.
What happened to Jack?
You won't be seeing him no more.
What about you, Ned?
Tried my best, boss.
Almost got my ass shot off.
Lost my damn hat, too.
- Where's Frank?
- They got him and the guns.
But we got this
and we're gonna make a little trade.
I’ve seen one of these once
at the armory in Cheyenne.
- It's heavy.
We trade Frank for Lilly.
When we get her,
we give Kid this toy,
and we get our money back.
- This is not a toy.
- Let's get to work.
I can't believe we're even
thinking about doing this.
I can't stand to think of her there
with those dirty, disgusting men.
The only reason she's there
is we went running off after Kid
in the first place.
Are you saying this is my fault?
All you care about
is revenge on Kid.
You went with us, Anita.
You came along.
I never should have gone.
None of us ever should have gone.
None of this ever
should have happened.
I shouldn't have let
anything happen.
Well, we have no choice.
We have to get Lilly.
I know!
- Anita.
- Let her go.
Anita!
- Anita?
- Anita!
Can I have some
of that water, please?
I’m mighty thirsty.
Thank you.
Couldn't help but overhearing
about that land.
In Oregon, ain't it?
Grand territory, Oregon.
Spent a couple of years there once.
A lot of rain, a lot of laws.
Don't like either.
Why are you talking to me?
Cody told me about your plans.
Sounds sweet.
It’s just that I’ve never heard
of no single miss
holding a claim for land...
in Oregon, that is.
Well, just because
you haven't heard of it
doesn't mean it can't happen.
Suppose not.
- Where's she off to?
- She's just riding off some steam.
She sure picked a good time
to pitch a fit.
If it were her in trouble,
Lilly'd be the first one to be there.
What's your name?
Lilly.
- Just Lilly?
- Lilly's enough.
Yeah, if you answer to it.
Well, that depends on who's askin'.
You don't look much like
a parlor-house girl
in those pants and boots.
What's your family name?
- Laronette.
- Laronette?
Huh. I knowed a Roy Laronette.
Seen him in a Wild West show
over in Del Rio.
- Best trick rider I ever seed.
- Is that a fact?
Well, how did the daughter
of a trick rider
wind up working
in a parlor house?
He died.
The show died with him.
It came up to me
to pay off his debts.
Oh.
Well, ain't you
Daddy's sweet little girl?
Sit her down.
Sit down!
We got a real hellcat here!
It may take some time
breakin' her in.
But it's gonna be
a lot of fun doin' it.
Well, this claim of yours seems
proper enough, young lady.
Why worry your little head?
Your husband seems to have
his matters well in hand.
What if my husband is deceased?
Ma'am, I don't quite know
how to tell you this, but
Tell me what?
Well, your claim's worthless
without your husband alive.
See for yourself.
Second paragraph.
Now, ma'am, I’m sorry,
but it's the law.
- Surely you understand that.
- Yes, I understand that.
I was worthless until I married,
so now I guess
I’m worthless as a widow.
Funny, I had some value
as a whore.
- Did I shock you?
- Well, no, ma'am, I
You expect me to cry
all over your big desk?
Well, to hell with that!
If your laws don't include me,
well, then, they just
don't apply to me, either.
Now, ma'am, that'll still be
six bits for my services.
Keep the change,
you sawed-off fart.
Don't let him play with you.
Well, lookie here.
My little whore finally
found herself a pretty-boy.
Keep talkin'.
That's all you can do.
Was a time I did a hell
of a lot more than talk to you.
You know where I found her?
She was scrubbin' floors
in a parlor house.
Wasn't more than 14.
She weren't contrary
like that back then.
No, sirree.
Got real excited
bein' with a bunch of bandits.
My God,
how she'd open up to me.
How she carried on.
And you... look at you.
A lovesick pretty-boy.
Now, after all these years
of wanting to kill me,
she won't let you.
Nothing's changed.
You're dead.
I just ain't killed you yet.
# Well, I haven't seen her
since that night #
# I can't cross the line, you know #
# I’m wanted for a gamblin' fight #
# Like as not it's better so #
# And yet I’ve often #
# Sort of missed her #
# Since that last sad night
I kissed her. #
Hey, pretty-boy,
come over here.
Come on over here.
I got something to tell you.
Yeah, you look just like your ma
real pretty.
Beautiful piece of a woman,
your ma.
Evangeline.
Am I right?
Josh!
What happened?
He tried to escape.
I shot him.
Did you shoot him
before or after you untied him?
I said did you shoot him
before or after you untied him?
He brought it on himself.
He was playing you
and you couldn't rein yourself in,
and now we can't
trade him for Lilly.
Get the hell out of my sight.
Keep riding till you hit
the Klondike.
Anita?
Don't tell her.
Sweetpea, where have you been?
- The claim's no good.
- What?
I went to a lawyer's office in town.
He said that the claim's no good
without Jim alive.
- Let's go get Lilly.
- Come on.
What are you lookin' at?
Pigs.
You know, you're gonna be
around here a while, girl.
You'd better be
a little more friendly-like
and get to know everybody.
Over here is Rico.
And this here's Ned.
Roberto.
And this here's Yuma.
Me and Yuma go back a long way.
Ain't that right, partner?
A long ways, Kid.
Go inside and get one of Cody's
old dresses out of my trunk.
Right away.
Have a drink.
Drink!
You know, the more
I think about it,
it might be nice
having you around here.
And let those whores
keep the old buzzard!
- Hey, boss.
Not that one.
The red one.
Get up.
- Get up.
- Uh!
Take your clothes off.
Get in here.
- Damn it, boss!
- You keep your ass in there!
At least let us watch!
Put it on.
Ned!
She's all yours.
Hello, girlie.
What do you say
old Ned unties you
and we can have some fun, huh?
You'd better kill me first,
'cause the only way I’d lay
with you is if I was dead.
It’s Josh!
- Look again.
- Lilly?
- Oh, Lilly!
- Lilly, I’ve been so worried about you.
Oh, my God,
you should have seen it.
It was crazy.
Bombs going off everywhere.
Josh came and attacked Kid's place.
Got me out of there.
I was ridin' out.
I looked behind me,
but he wasn't there.
- Where is he?
- I think they got him.
Yah!
- Where's the old man?
- Dead.
Well, that is a shame.
What are you gonna do now?
Where's McCoy?
Oh, him.
He's here.
But I wouldn't worry about him.
He ain't dead... yet.
I’ll buy him.
You ain't got enough money
to buy him from me, darlin'.
Well, now, you don't have
a Gatling gun, do you?
That is true. That is true.
- Just show me the gun.
- Show me McCoy.
I’ve shown you mine.
You show me yours.
Can I offer you ladies a drink?
Go get it.
Aah!
Kid!
- And hurry up!
- Yeah, boss.
Come on.
Hyah, hyah.
Open that up.
Let's see what we got there.
Hey, Lilly, welcome back.
Yes! Yes!
Aah!
You want him?
Take him.
Josh.
Josh.
Oh, that's real sweet...
coming from a heartless whore.
- That's what you came for.
Now get your ass outta here.
Cody, let's go.
Girlie.
You come back and see
old Ned, you hear?
We'll finish what we got started.
Lilly.
Split up!
- Cover me!
Lilly!
Cody. Here, here, here.
Aah!
Yah!
Just foolin'.
You don't think I’d shoot you
in the back, do you, darlin'?
I’m out of bullets.
I got no bullets.
Pick it up. Put it in.
Die like a man.
You are a dumb whore.
Looks like you could use
some help.
You know, I reckon I could.
You all set to go?
I guess.
Sure be mighty pleased
if you decided to stay on.
Share this place.
Oh...
well...
William, I think there's
something I need to tell you.
I know all about that.
It’s all in the past.
It don't matter to me none,
so you don't have to
I'm no lady from New Orleans.
My daddy was a poor rancher.
Nearly worked himself to death
till the bank came
and took it all away.
I told myself
I'd get away
from that damn dirt pile
and marry me a rich gentleman.
I was so stupid.
All I ever got was a couple
of fancy dresses
and a broken heart.
I got this land.
I ain't got no money.
But I swear...
I’ll never break your heart.
Oh! Jeez, that's my arm!
That's your share.
You earned it.
Consider it a wedding present.
Oh. I got everything
I need right here.
- But I’ll take it.
Well, the rest of it's here.
All except the $12,432
which belongs to us.
You should stay.
When that money gets back
to Agua Dulce,
I expect y'all are gonna be
pretty big heroes in these parts.
Well, we ain't heroes.
Well, it's time to go.
There's a certain gold mine
in the Klondike
waiting on some hard work.
That's a long way.
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye, sweetpea.
See you.
Take good care of her.
She's two handfuls,
but I’m gonna hang on.
Eileen.
Hey. You'll see her again.
It ain't likely.
I love you.
Let's ride.
Shh.
Oh, Lilly, I love you
all the way to the moon and back,
and that's not gonna change.
Yah!
She killed a fella
up in Colorado Territory.
Sorry, son.
The only female I seen
in the last month
is that mare over there.
And she's startin' to look
pretty good to me.
- Ain't she, Tector? Huh?
- Yeah.
Hey, what's that
you're drinking there?
- Tennessee sippin' whiskey.
- Come on!
