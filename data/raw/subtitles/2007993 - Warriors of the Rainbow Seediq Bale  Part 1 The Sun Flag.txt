This film is based on the true event of
"Wushe incident"
Mouna! Take it easy!
A good hunter waits patiently.
Out of the way! Let me do it!
Move!
Mouna! Mouna!
Mouna, be carefull.
Mouna!
Mouna, here come the
Bununs from Kntabang Clan!
Let's go! Come on!
Come on, let's go! Leave the boar!
There he is!
Kill him!
Mouna, get down!
Over there!
- Mouna is over there!
- Shoot him!
Come on! Hurry!
Listen to me! My name is Mouna Rudo!
Be alert when you hear this name again!
Who?
Who becomes the hero?
Who is it?
Your Mouna is back!
It's your Mouna! He's back!
It's Mouna!
Mouna is a true man now.
Mouna is back!
Well done, Mouna!
A true man is back!
The hero is back!
Mouna...
you've offered blood sacrifice
to our ancestors' spirits
I hereby tattoo the marks
of manhood on your face.
From now on...
you shall abide by our ancestral spirit
to guard our clan and our hunting grounds
to guard our clan and our hunting grounds.
On the rainbow bridge
our ancestors' spirits await the reunion
with your valiant soul.
<b>Warriors of The Rainbow I: Sun Flag</b>
In 1895
the island of Taiwan was ceded to Japan
under the Treaty of Shimonoseki
between Japan and China
The island of Taiwan
is the new territory of our empire
yet to receive our Mikado's grace.
The islanders are warlike innately
it's said that they're armed to fight us
but they're a scattered bunch,
nothing to be afraid of.
Once disembarked at Keelung Port
we must sweep the entire island with force.
We must prevent any
disrespect from the people
so as to gain their wholehearted allegiance
to our empire of the sun.
Especially the heartland of Taiwan
occupied by the tribal savages.
There are ample resources
of lumber and mines in the mountains.
Endless treasures...
Father, last night I dreamt of a deer
with white spots around its eyes...
Sisin babblers are singing
an auspicious song.
Go ahead and hunt the deer in your dream
...for your own wedding.
Wait! Hold on!
Hold on!
Charge!
Hold on!
Charge!
Let's kill them!
That was the deer in my dream.
Listen to me!
Dance! Let's dance!
Everyone Dance!
Come and dance, my in-law!
Come on, everyone! Let's dance!
This is my son Mouna Rudo.
The bravest and strongest
Warrior in Mehebu Clan.
He'll be an unparalleled chief.
You're wise to marry your daughter to him.
Dance! Let's dance!
Let's cheer for them!
Be joyful, everyone!
Out of the way!
Stand clear of the path please.
Out of the way! Please!
Out of the way!
Out of the way! Move!
Out of the way please!
Hey, my old friend!
Oh no! It's him again.
My old friend!
You from Mehebu Clan! Over here!
Over here!
Hey, boss!
Come.
Must you wear such a big head
on that small head of yours?
My old friend!
Mouna?
Seediqs from Toda.
You from Tnbarah Clan, over here!
Hey, young man,
don't you make trouble here.
The tallest one is Mouna Rudo
of Mehebu Clan from Tgdaya.
You've come all the way here
with so little meat for exchange?
Those of you from Toda are so shameless.
Why don't you offer your
hunting grounds to us for free?
Mouna Rudo, don't be too proud
I'm not afraid of you.
Mouna Rudo, I'm Temu Walis
I'll cut your head off when I grow up.
Temu Walis?
You won't have the chance to grow up.
Is that Temu Cire?
No, it's Temu Walis
I mean that grown-up man
I don't know. Not someone famous, I guess.
Gather up, young men!
Come on! Bring your weapons!
Come with us! Quick!
Put these away!
Quick! All young men come with us!
Run!
Temu!
Mouna!
Mouna!
Mouna, he's one of our own.
No one can ever run ahead of me,
you hear?
Come on, Labay!
Are you alright?
Laying railway tracks?
It's no easy task in the mountains.
In order to harvest the natural resources
in those forests
we need to have proper transportation.
Yeah.
It's a shame to leave those
resources undeveloped
but those savages up there...
Sir?
Here she is, sir.
She dares not lead you past
Hakaw Supeitei, Captain.
She'll spend the night
in her father's house in Meisi.
She won't accompany you to the
hunting grounds of other clans.
Much obliged.
Let's go!
Captain?
Those savages in the mountains
are rather ferocious.
Please be careful!
Hey!
Hey, it's your turn now.
Wow! How beautiful!
Yes, indeed.
It was so dark last night
that we didn't notice we're surrounded
by cherry blossom trees.
Cherry blossoms?
They really are cherry blossoms.
It's so red.
Red as blood.
Blockade the entire Wushe region.
Ban all trading between the Hans
and the Wushe savages.
Yes, sir.
Back off!
Put down your weapons! Go up there!
Hurry up!
Come on!
It's an ambush! Watch out!
Hide there! Quick!
They're up there!
Uwe! Uwe!
Retreat!
There's no way out!
These intruders are out of their minds.
How dare they show up at my doorstep.
Throw them down!
Get out of here! Quick!
Hurry up!
Follow me!
I see.I see
I see.
A Short Account of Taiwan
Give me their biggest enemy.
There they are!
Hello.
Here.
The intruders don't allow
the Hans to deal with us.
But we can deal with you, can't we?
Idiots!
Bring me the wine!
Bring the wine!
Drink!
Look!
I'm Mouna Rudo I killed at Hakaw Supeitei
a chief of the intruders.
Mouna Rudo?
You're Mouna Rudo?
Yes, I am.
Mouna Rudo!
Chief? Chief?
Where is Mouna Rudo?
I couldn't get him drunk.
Wake up!
Those Bununs from Kntabang
Clan are hunting heads.
Get up! Let's go!
Let's get out of here! Hurry!
"All the human beings on this land."
"The gods bestow upon us a mortal life."
"But we are true men indeed."
"A true man dies in the battlefield"
"and he strides to the heavenly home
of our ancestors."
"There lies a fertile hunting ground"
"that can only be guarded..."
"by a qualified true man."
"When he arrives at the heavenly home
of our ancestors"
"he'll come across a
beautiful rainbow bridge."
"The ancestors' spirits guarding it say..."
"Let's take a look at your hands."
"When the man opens his hands"
"we see bloodstains that
can never be wiped clean."
"Now you're a true man indeed!"
says our ancestors' spirits."
Come out, guys!
Bring your weapons!
Come on!
"Go! Go ahead! My hero!"
"Your soul may now enter the heavenly home
of our ancestors"
"to guard the hunting ground of honor."
Stop it! It'll never be ignited.
"And a true woman"
"must be good at weaving
red coat of arms for her man."
"When she reaches the rainbow bridge"
"she opens her hands"
"showing her calluses that
can never be removed."
"Go! Go ahead! You're a true woman"
"say the ancestors' spirits guarding
the rainbow bridge."
"Your soul may now enter the heavenly home
of our ancestors."
"No go weave a rainbow-like
dress for yourself!"
- Be careful!
- Over there!
Stop!
"A man who's never decapitated an enemy"
"or a woman who's not good at weaving"
"is not qualified to have
their faces tattooed."
"Some day, when they're gone"
"and their souls arrive
at the rainbow bridge"
"the ancestors' spirits
guarding it would see their"
"clean faces and ask..."
How dare you bring a machete! Bastard!
"Are these my children?"
"Are you my children?"
"Go back! Go back now!"
"You're not true Seediqs."
"You're not qualified to enter the
heavenly home of our ancestors."
Run! Come on!
Let's get out of here!
Run, Mouna!
Just go!
Rudo, are you alright?
Father!
"Suddenly, the tribesmen
find themselves blowsy"
"their eyes blank."
"They turn around in shame and walk though
the rugged valleys."
"They become wailing ghosts
suffering unbearable pain"
"from all the cuts by the poisonous crabs
along the creek."
Mouna...
you must keep the intruders
away from our clan.
"Mouna, do you understand?"
"Abide by our ancestral dictations"
"and be a Seediq Bale a true man."
Excuse me, sir.
Let's see...
The first one from the left is Mouna Rudo
the chief of Mehebu Clan.
Those behind him are Ubus and Mouna Sine.
Mouna, stop glaring.
Look down.
Mouna, stop glaring.
Ubus.
Our ancestors never lost
any of our hunting grounds in the past
I can't believe these intruders
are taking them away from us now
I'll never submit to them
I will never.
These are all yours?
I will never!
Mouna!
Stop it!
Mouna!
Mouna!
Hurry up! It's going to rain.
Awi!
Awi!
What's wrong?
Are you alright?
What's wrong?
Are you alright?
Wushe, 1930
Schools, clinics, grocery stores
post offices, hotels, boardinghouses...
We've managed to civilize
all the Wushe savages.
It's not an easy task.
Hard to imagine that
this was once the most
uncivilized heartland here.
Carrying logs...
and walking from the
lumberyard uphill to here
takes them a whole day, doesn't it?
Don't worry. These savages are strong.
And they're more than happy
to earn some money for millet wine.
Come on. This way please.
Mr. Satsuka,
how long have you been in Wushe?
Over a decade.
So you know this region very well?
Of course. My wife is a savage woman.
- I know this region like the back of my hand.
- It's this bone right here.
It hurts so much when you press it.
Right here?
Ah! Easy!
Here! Have a drink!
No more wine for us please.
We can't afford it.
It's alright.
This one's on me.
You're indeed a beautiful serpent.
Every day I carry those damn logs
without getting paid properly.
Now I'm so broke that even my hounds
look down on me.
We're losing our hunting grounds
and you still keep the
hounds to look down on you?
Look!
Those are the trees that used to watch
over our ancestors.
This is how they end up.
Strange thing is, why
so many constructions?
What? Not only do you befriend us with wine
but you speak our language fluently.
Hey! It's going to rain.
- Stop drinking and go home!
- Good morning, sir!
Good morning, Mr. Policeman.
You've worked all day
long for such a mean wage
and you waste it on wine?
What else can we do with so little money?
Yeah, right! We're savages, aren't we?
We aren't supposed to know anything
about saving money.
Yeah, Mr. Policeman.
You're Japanese, sir.
You don't know how hard our lives are.
Only Mr. Wu here understands us.
He's a beautiful serpent.
He's a viper!
- Excuse me.
- Hello.
- I'd like some salt, please.
- No problem.
Oh no! It's raining!
Hurry up and go home, sir.
Or your glorious uniform
will be soaking wet.
Go ahead!
Go on!
Run, sir!
Your Japanese fur is too precious to spoil.
It's raining.
Go collect the laundry hanging outside.
Can't you tell what needs to be done first?
Hey, come back!
Are you taking the baby out in the rain?
I'm sorry.
What an imbecile!
Who'd marry such an idiot like you?
When it rains, it pours.
Good morning.
This is our policeman Hanaoka Jiro.
This is our new police
minister Ekawa Hakudo.
Jiro is a savage too.
Older brother.
- Older sister.
- Older sister.
- Younger brother.
- Younger brother.
- Younger sister.
- Younger sister.
Okay, one more time.
- Father.
- Father.
- Mother.
- Mother.
- Older brother.
- Older brother.
Older sister...
Hurry! She's in labor!
Two savages can never give birth
to a Japanese child.
Are you alright, Hanako?
This job is for women only.
What are you doing?
Dakis, get out of here!
Get out!
Oh, what an extraordinary sight!
Timber!
Hark, people
Behold, people
Oh, our warriors
The youngsters much like
the budding pine leaves
They show true bravery
Fought in the falling leaves
Fought under the withered pine tree
Now they're back with heads hunted
Our warriors fought with all their might
Mahebu Police Station
Chief!
Pawan,
why aren't you in school?
I'm sick.
Sick?
But you don't look like sick.
Did your teacher beat you?
I raced a Japanese kid and I won.
And the kid was crying.
The teacher blamed me for bullying him,
so he beat me.
Can I have another one please?
I'll win the race on the sports day.
Those Japanese kids can cry their balls out
when they watch me getting awarded.
Chief,
I hate the Japanese.
Chief Mouna?
My grandpa said you were a hero
when you were younger.
Your grandpa said I was a
hero when I was younger?
I'm still a hero. Does he know that?
Chief Mouna,
will you take me along
next time you go hunting?
Pawan, where is your hunting ground?
Chief Mouna!
I'm alright. Just a little
bit tipsy, that's all.
What the hell?
Hanako!
Look what you have done!
How many times do I have to tell you
that you cannot drag these logs along?
You destroyed the logs.
Only the bark is scratched.
The inside is still intact.
You savages!
How many times do I have to tell you?
What? You wanna fight?
The paths are slippery because of rain.
He nearly lost his life
slipping down a slope.
Where is your log?
Slipped into the ravine.
Slipped?
Do you know how expensive it is?
Pihu!
Yoshimura!
Chief Mouna...
Sir Yoshimura?
You're looking at me at
such a disrespectful angle.
Aren't you afraid of being stabbed blind?
Who do you think you are?
You're not the boss here in Mehebu
lam!
You will not get paid today.
The precious logs are destroyed.
Do it again and you'll
have to pay for the loss.
- Keep working!
- With what?
We get nothing from working for you.
What do you want us to pay with?
Pihu!
- Chief Mouna, he...
- I saw it.
Go home!
Go home!
Yoshimura, stop picking on them.
You don't know nothing
I was educating them.
These damn savages!
I'll have you pay for this some day.
Good morning.
Good morning.
What? Checking out guns?
Watan Robo is getting married
We've got some preparations to do.
Tado? Baso?
I heard your father Mouna Rudo
has mobilized lots of men for this hunt?
Yeah, but what can we hunt
in those disappearing forests?
You've about hacked down all the trees
on our hunting grounds.
If we don't go hunting now
we'll have nothing left
once the trees are all gone.
Tado Mouna!
You'd better watch your mouth!
Savages will always be savages.
They have no manners at all.
Wait!
Pawan?
What is the kid doing there?
Pawan!
Chief Mouna!
My hunting ground is right here!
Temu Walis?
You red-foot pheasant!
Don't you know this is the
Mehebu hunting ground?
Mouna!
It's just a misunderstanding.
This is the first time my
eldest son goes hunting
I asked Temu to bring me here.
Mouna, I asked Temu to teach him.
Even so, you cannot trespass
into our Mehebu hunting ground.
This used to be our Toda hunting ground
when my uncle was alive.
You Mehebu clansmen robbed it from us.
Rob it back if you can.
Enough!
Mouna, can you do me this favor?
Favor?
Kojima...
if you lived in Mehebu now,
I'd do you this favor.
But you live in Tnbarah Clan.
Take these red-foot pheasants
and get out of my hunting ground
I don't care if it's your
hunting ground or theirs
because everything here
belongs to us Japanese now.
Temu,
you just wait and see.
Some day I'll destroy your Tnbarah Clan.
Go on and do it if you dare.
Let's see who's killed first
I don't care if you're Mouna Rudo.
Wow, well done.
Can a girl carry such a heavy load?
Go! Go!
Good girl!
The men in your clan
are all out hunting, aren't they?
Wanna make some extra bucks?
- Come with me to my boardinghouse!
- No!
- I'll give you two dollars.
- No!
What the hell? Bastard!
Sir Sugiura, how dare you!
Harassing a Mehebu woman?
I was offering her a chance to earn
some extra money in our substation.
It's no big deal
I know you Japanese policemen too well.
Take that blind prey of yours and scram.
It's true, and she accepted it too.
Another word from you
and I'll have the hounds feast on you.
Phooey! Fine, fine.
It's hard to reason with you savages.
You deserve it!
Chicken!
You're back, Sapu.
Chief, the matches you wanted.
Sapu?
Let the kids eat more meat.
They're too skinny.
Mouna! Mouna!
Bakan, why does Mouna need so many matches?
Who knows?
Had any meat, my boy?
Have a drink!
Father! Father!
Father, can we slaughter a cow?
Not enough to eat?
It's enough, but we haven't had beef
for such a long time.
Do it then.
Let's slaughter a cow!
Hooray! Let's slaughter a cow!
Baso, grab it!
Grab its legs!
Come on!
I've cut off the head
of the Japanese Governor-general.
Wow! What a party!
Sir Yoshimura.
Whose wedding day is it?
It's Watan and Lubi's.
Come! Have a drink with us, sir.
No.
- No.
- Come on, have a drink.
No way
I don't drink the wine with
your nasty saliva in it.
- Come on, have a drink.
- I told you that I don't want to.
Your hand is all dirty with blood.
- I invited you with good will.
- You son-of-a-bitch!
You've soiled me with blood!
I offered you a drink and you hit me?
I'll beat you into senses!
- Stop!
- I don't need to reason with a savage.
What is it? Let's go look!
Hurry UP!
I know what you said just now
with a boar's head in your hand.
Out of my way! Say it again
in Japanese if you dare.
Say it again!
- Get out of my way!
- I dare you!
Come on, guys!
Faster!
Tado!
Baso, kill him!
I'm holding down his feet! Beat him up!
I'm holding down his feet again!
Stop! All of you!
What is it? What the hell?
Let me cut off this pig head of yours!
Stop! Stop! Yoshi...
Yoshimura.
Yoshimura.
You're in big trouble.
You have the nerve to beat me up.
Let's kill him!
Shut your mouth!
Excuse us! Let us through!
I'll kill all you Mehebu clansmen
I'll kill you all.
Let's do it, Father,
before the Japanese kill us all.
Why the hell did you provoke him
when you knew he'd kill us all?
You're nothing but a bunch of hounds
that can only chase and hunt
and know nothing of self-restraint.
How much longer do I
have to put up with you?
Out of my way!
Now you're here to bribe me with wine?
It's too late
I've filed the report on the case
of you beating up a police officer.
Tell you something...
This time I'll destroy your clan.
Yoshimura...
I, Mouna Rudo, come here to
apologize to you personally.
Stop being so arrogant.
Who do you think you are?
You think you're still a chief?
You can't even control your own sons
I don't think you're qualified.
To be a chief any more.
Get out!
Who the hell let you in?
Get the hell out!
I don't want to see your faces again.
Go home and rot!
Hey! Why did you do that to him?
Shut up!
I couldn't sleep last night
because of a mosquito.
Really? I'll see to it.
Mr. Hanaoka!
Yes?
May I know which clan you grew up in?
Gungu Clan.
And your original name?
Dakis Nawi.
Dakis Nawi.
We have another savage policeman
named Hanoka Ichiro.
He is the highest educated policemen here.
What are you doing this afternoon?
I'm going home for some private matter
I was to ask you to patrol
all the savage clans with us
and tell me the relationships
among them all.
- Come with us!
- No, it's alright.
It's alright.
Do whatever you need to do.
It's alright.
- Kabasawa will go with us.
- Yes.
He knows the savages well too.
Yoshimura has reported Tado's case
to the substation
I can't believe this Yoshimura.
Chief Mouna apologized to him personally.
Why did he insist on filing the case?
Yoshimura and Sugiura are not the same
as Kojima after all.
They will never try to
understand our people.
If Kojima were living in Mehebu
there wouldn't be so much trouble.
Since I was very little
I've always been scared of Chief Mouna.
It looks as if underneath his mantle
he's always gripping his machete
ready to draw it to kill anytime.
He's no ordinary man.
He's impossible to be tamed.
It must be difficult for him to torn between
the expectations of his fellow tribesmen
and the intimidation of the Japanese.
Aren't we living like that as well?
We don't want to be savages
but however hard we try to dress up
like the Japanese
we'll always be seen as uncivilized people.
We've lived like this for 20 years.
Another 20 years won't be impossible.
By the time our children grow up
maybe we will have changed forever
the savage image of ours.
Do we still have the chance?
Mehebu Clan may be wiped out soon.
Father, let's fight the Japanese.
- Ouch! It hurts!
- You dumb ass!
Father, don't be mad!
- Father!
- You never learn!
- Enough!
- You moron!
Oh no! How come...
It's the temporary bamboo bridge
that the savages used in the past.
It's ugly and insecure,
but they keep walking over it
I'll tear it down sooner or later.
But it saves them lots of time
if they walk over it to
fetch water or to the field.
Look! This wire bridge is strong and firm.
Tado?
Tado?
This young man is Tado Mouna
the eldest son of the
Mehebu chief Mouna Rudo.
But he saw us without saying anything
ls there anything wrong with him?
No, it's a habit of the savages.
It's not a very good habit.
Oh well, they're savages after all.
Can you stop talking about them like that?
- Sugiura!
- Welcome, sirs.
This is Officer Sugiura.
This way please.
You should've informed me
before you came here, sir
I could've asked those savages
to welcome you with dances.
No need for that.
We're only showing our hospitality.
Chief Mouna!
Chief Mouna!
What?
Chief Mouna,
can you tell me something about Japan?
I know you've been there before.
They have armies, cannons, machineguns
airplanes and large steamers in Japan.
There are more Japanese people
than the tree leaves in the forest
than the pebbles in Jhuoshuei River
I know why you're asking me this.
You don't really want to know Japan.
All you want is to remind me
how powerful the Japanese are.
Don't worry. I'll never forget.
Humph! You Japanese policemen
took us on the ship for days to Japan
but all they showed us
were airplanes and cannons.
However,
the policemen in Japan were much nicer
and kinder than those of you here.
They feared we'd revolt against them
so they tried their best to befriend us.
But those of you here in the mountains
always provoke us so much
that I want to hunt your heads.
Chief Mouna, I'm still a Seediq.
Although I'm now a Japanese policeman
I never forget that the same
blood runs in our veins.
Dakis,
when you die are you
entering a Japanese shrine?
Or the heavenly home of our ancestors?
I heard that...
in the school for savage children
you beat up our kids like the Japanese do
I beat them up because
I don't want the Japanese
to look down on them.
You graduated from Normal School.
You're more highly-educated
than any other Japanese policemen.
But how come you get the lowest salary?
Don't the Japanese look
down on you already?
Beating up your own people makes them
look down on you even more.
During our stay in Japan
the Japanese knew all of us chiefs
from different clans hated one another
but they made us sit together
at the dining table deliberately.
We were glaring at one another
all the time while we were eating
intending to draw our machetes and kill.
Humph! The Japanese are
good at these things.
Chief, is it so bad to be
ruled by the Japanese?
At least we're leading a civilized life.
We have schools and post offices
and we don't have to survive
by hunting savagely any more.
Is it so bad to be ruled by the Japanese?
Is it so good to be ruled by them?
Our men are forced to bend over
to carry logs on our backs
and our women have to kneel down
to serve and pour wine.
And all the money ends up
in the pockets of the Japanese policemen
I'm a chief
but all I can do is get drunk
and pretend I see nothing and hear nothing.
What else can I do?
Post offices? Stores? Schools?
Do any of those things
make our lives easier and better?
Instead, we're made to see
how impoverished we are.
Chief,
can't we bear it for another 20 years?
In 20 years, there will be no Seediq
and there will be no hunting ground.
All our children will have turned Japanese.
Chief Mouna,
have you made up your mind to do it?
Chief Mouna?
- About Yoshimura...
- I'm old.
Don't worry.
The Japanese are far too powerful
I won't go against them.
Go home.
This is the hunting ground
that belongs to me only.
Get lost.
- Chief...
- Get lost!
Dakis, have a drink.
Go home and get yourself dead-drunk.
We can't drink any more.
- We already...
- Drink!
The millet wine that we make
can set our people free
making them sing and dance,
cry and laugh freely.
You'll see once you're drunk.
Go home now.
Mouna!
Father?
Mouna,
the tattoos on your face
are still so dark and clear.
You're indeed a Seediq Bale.
You're a true hero.
Mouna?
Look at the lines on that rock.
It split into half
when struck by the lightening, didn't it?
In the dim light at dusk
the lightening splits a rock into half.
What a beautiful sight!
Father?
I can't keep the intruders away.
Ah, it's for real
Here I am
I used to guard these mountains
and forests bravely
Oh yes, it's for real
Mouna,
let's sing.
We haven't sung together for long.
Reminisce the people from the past
Here I am
I used to guard these mountains
and forests bravely
These are our mountains
These are our creeks
We're the true Seediq Bale
We go hunting in the mountains
We share food in our clan
We fetch water from the creeks
I'm willing to give my life for these
Oh, creek! Be quiet
Sisin babblers are singing
Sing us a beautiful song please
Sing for our people
a song of our ancestral spirit
I'm willing to give my life too
When the lightening rifts the rock
a rainbow appears
and a proud man emerges
Who is this man so proud?
It's your offspring
A Seediq Bale
What?
Tado Mouna became a hero before I did.
Those Japanese are outrageous
I can't believe they beat up someone
who offers them a drink.
A while ago...
three girls from Boarung Clan
were asked to serve them drinks
and they were raped.
Why couldn't Tado be a real hero
and kill Yoshimura right on the spot?
Kill him?
Don't you remember
how my family died?
My father killed only one Japanese man
and they burned my whole family alive
I was hiding in the woods watching
without even blinking my eyes.
So...
that's why we can't kill
only one Japanese man.
We have to kill all of
them to make a difference.
Are you kidding me?
We wouldn't still be sitting here
if we could kill them all.
Now the Mehebu chief Mouna Rudo
is driven to bay by that policeman
from the lumberyard
and the day after tomorrow on October 27th
is the big sports day.
By then, all the Japanese in Wushe
are going to gather in one place.
Is it time already?
Father, there won't be a better chance.
And we have no other choice.
We can't have the Japanese
look down on us any more.
We need to show them what we're made of.
Let's fight them, Chief.
Yeah! Let's fight them.
Young men...
I hate the Japanese
no less than you do.
But do you realize that
we're going to die after all this
and all our people will be wiped out?
Our ancestors shed their blood
in exchange for our lives.
Now we're taking our children along
to the battlefield to shed blood.
We're Seediq Bale, aren't we?
Temu,
does your father know you're here?
My father told me that
I should ask Chief Mouna
to help us youngsters
get our faces tattooed
so that the ancestors' spirits
guarding the rainbow bridge
will recognize us as the true Seediqs.
Father?
If we want revenge,
it'd be the business of Mehebu Clan alone.
But if we're offering a blood sacrifice
to our ancestors
it will be the business
of all the 12 clans in Wushe.
Keep it a secret before action.
We must tell none of the
elders, children or women
- in all these clans.
- When did you...
I'm speaking here. Are you listening?
Keep it a secret before action
I knew Chief Mouna had a plan already.
What do you know?
It's your idea and your responsibility.
Inform the chiefs of all the 12 clans.
Tomorrow morning...
we're going to gather in Wushe
and offer a blood sacrifice.
Our ancestors' spirits...
We're here for the guns.
Sorry to disturb you.
- Boss...
- Welcome. This way please.
Fill them up with salt
And give me ten boxes of matches.
Wow! Lots of things to buy, huh?
Boss, we'll pay for it next time.
On credit again?
- Yes, we can.
- How much is it?
No, you can't!
Wait! You're buying all these on credit?
It's alright.
It's alright? But you never pay me back!
Let's give them a hand.
That old drunkard Mouna Rudo
really can't take it any more?
I'll ask the young men to get ready
before they all get dead drunk.
Young man,
how dare you tell me these
in front of the police station!
Good morning!
Pihu Sapu?
What the hell was he up to?
That crazy boy spells nothing but trouble.
But we'd be bored around here without him,
won't we?
You call making troubles interesting?
Tado, look!
Only the gun barrel is left.
No, I won't do it.
Won't do it?
Chief Dahdo...
the chiefs of the other clans
have all agreed to join us
and everything is ready now.
Fighting the Japanese will
lead us to death only.
We've had three chiefs in our family
that died of fighting the Japanese.
Now
we've stooped to bring you kids up
to carry on the lifeline of our people
not to get killed on the battlefield.
- Chief...
- We're not afraid of death.
Even Chief Mouna agreed to do it.
Chief Dahdo,
they'll laugh at us if you don't do it.
They can laugh at me for all I care
I'll never allow our Gungu Clan
to join the battle. Period.
But Chief...
Chief!
Are you going to be a hunter forever
without guns or hunting grounds?
You have no tattoo on your face.
Don't forget whom you're talking to.
What do we do now?
I can't stand that old man.
No way
I won't allow our young clansmen
to sacrifice themselves
in vain with you maniacs.
But...
I won't let out this secret of yours.
Go home.
You only show off your bravery
with those animal skulls now?
Chief Walis,
you once fought the Japanese
at Hakaw Supeitei.
Where's your bravery now?
Bravery? I gave it all to you long ago.
Bring your women and children here
to our Paran Clan
to keep the bloodline of your clan.
A clan so big...
with so many people...
What are you doing?
Hello, sir!
Come closer.
Stop fooling around!
Go home and clean your places up.
Yes, sir.
Go on!
Sorry.
Stay away, kids.
Okay, ready.
One, two, three
I'm not going in.
Make me proud in tomorrow's games.
Can you stay with us, Father?
No, I can't.
I have to go back before dark.
You're spending the night
here be a good boy,
you hear?
See you then.
Bye.
Take care.
Let's go!
Excuse me!
Mouna
knows everything about battles.
But I'm old. I can't go with him.
But...
But our Drodux Clan won't
be absent in this.
Do I have to say it again in Japanese?
Good morning!
Pihu! What's wrong with you?
Pihu!
Good morning!
Why did you get all our
hounds to bark like crazy?
Chief Mouna, didn't you say
that you wouldn't do it?
Do what? Who says I'm doing anything?
Dakis,
you're nothing but a police
dog wearing a collar.
Did your master send you
here as a persuader?
Tado!
Dakis,
you haven't answered my
question from last time.
When you die, are you
entering a Japanese shrine
or the heavenly home of our ancestors?
Are you Dakis? Or Hanaoka Ichiro?
I'm a true Seediq tribesman. I am!
- But...
- If you are, take off your uniform
and offer blood sacrifice to our ancestors
with us tomorrow.
You know well how many
soldiers the Japanese have.
You're going to get killed for nothing.
You told me the other day that there are
more Japanese people than...
There are more Japanese people
than the tree leaves in the forest
than the pebbles in Jhuoshuei River.
But my determination to fight them
is more adamant than Mt. Chilai.
If your civilization wants us to cringe
I'll show you the pride of savages.
The true Seediq tribesmen.
Listen carefully, Dakis.
You being a Seediq descendant
who never tried to understand yourself.
A Seediq Bale can lose his body
but he fights to keep his soul at all cost.
A Seediq who loses his soul
will be forsaken by our ancestors' spirits.
Do you understand...
...my Child?
There are over 130 guns
in the Wushe substation
and many boxes of ammunition too.
On the sports day tomorrow.
Jiro... Dakis Nawi will be on duty
I'll tell him everything beforehand.
Father, will he betray us?
No, he won't.
Can't believe all the gunpowder
I spent years collecting will go to waste.
What is it, Pihu?
They're all cowards!
Chief,
only six clans are willing to join us.
A little more than 300 men in all
300 men?
I tried so hard to persuade them
I was so incensed that I
nearly drew my machete.
- But they...
- Take it easy.
Chief...
It's quite enough to have 300.
Go home quietly.
- Don't get caught before action.
- Chief...
Get out of here. All of you.
Get out!
Why do men belittle women so?
Don't forget all the pride you boast of
comes from us women
It is us who weave your glory
It is us women behind
men's tattoos of bravery
The sun...
I'm on my way
to the heavenly home of our ancestors
We'll be back as brothers
Hark!
Behold!
My soul fights in the falling leaves
I am Mouna Rudo
I bring home the innocent souls
Young warriors
No one can defeat us
Oh, our warriors
much like the budding pine leaves
You don't think I know
what you men are up to, do you?
I'm the chief's daughter.
Wherever you're going
the children and I will follow.
Your job is to guard this firepan
and keep the fire burning.
When it's time to leave
I'll take you along with me.
Yamada!
Sugiura, get out of there!
- Come on, coward.
- Who is it? What's going on?
What's going on?
Stop! Who is it?
Baso, what the hell?
What the hell are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?
Shut up!
Do you know who I am?
I'm Tado Mouna, a true warrior
When you bleed, the animosity
between you and me no longer exists
I'm a true warrior
I'm a Seediq Bale, a true warrior
Your soul is welcome to dwell with me
I'll feed you with millet wine and foods
There's no longer hatred between us
When you bleed, the animosity
between you and me no longer exists
You'll be with our ancestors' spirits
to watch over my people
Lubi, keep the fire burning
I'll be home before dark.
Women! Children!
Why aren't you singing?
Sing!
Sing!
Mouna!
My old friend!
Mouna! Chief Mouna!
Shut up!
Not you.
Tanah,
split your men into two teams.
You lead one team along Bkasan River
to annihilate all the police stations
and cut off the communication
of the Japanese to the east.
The other team follows me to Gungu Clan
to meet up with other clans.
What do we do after those police
stations are annihilated?
After that? Come to
Mehebu Clan for a drink.
Chief Mouna!
Where are they? Aren't they here yet?
They're all here
but Chief Dahdo doesn't allow
our Gungu Clan to join in the battle.
Everyone's trying to convince him.
Have all the police
stations been annihilated?
We've burned down every one of them.
Then why waste our time persuading him?
I said no.
Our clan is big. We must join in.
Chief Dahdo...
even a boar fights back when driven to bay
Why don't you understand?
I'd rather be punished by the Japanese
than have our whole clan wiped out.
My children,
don't you remember how your fathers died?
No one from our Gungu
Clan is allowed to go.
Are you frightened to
death by the Japanese?
Or are you spoiled by them?
Chief! Chief Mouna!
You know well that we're
bound to lose this battle.
Why do you insist on fighting it?
Because of our ancestral spirit
that's soon to be forgotten.
Look at these young men.
Their faces are clean
without the Seediq tattoos.
Do you want to see their souls
forsaken by our ancestors' spirits?
Or don't you think they're qualified
to be Seediq Bale with
hands stained with blood?
Ancestral spirit?
Ancestral spirit!
You want to sacrifice their lives
in exchange for these tattoos
but what does it take to get
these young lives back?
Pride!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Mr. Inspector,
look! Here comes the mist!
What a beautiful sight!
Here comes your brother. Good luck!
Good luck!
What a thick mist!
Yeah, it's often misty around here.
But with a mist so thick
how will they judge the games?
Those games are just for kids
Having fun is all that matters.
Come on, have more hot tea. It's chilly.
Thank you.
We still have time for a rest.
Be careful!
I'm sorry.
Are you alright?
Yeah, thank you.
Let's do it. There's no turning back.
My children...
at the other end of the rainbow
in the heavenly home of our ancestors
lies a fertile hunting ground.
Our ancestors are all there.
Only brave souls are allowed to enter
It's the one hunting ground
we cannot afford to lose.
Fellow tribesmen!
My fellow tribesmen!
Let's hunt the heads of our enemies.
We can no longer keep the hunting ground
in the Wushe mountains.
Let's wash our souls clean with blood.
Stride over the rainbow
to our eternal hunting ground.
We're offering a blood
sacrifice to our ancestors.
Young men,
let our ancestors' spirits
be possessed in your blades.
Entrust your hatred to
the clouds and mists.
Let's do it.
Be still!
How many times do I have to tell you?
Go to the back of the line!
No, it's not what you think.
Hello?
Really?
How fair-spoken you are!
No, you're too kind.
Hatsuko!
What the hell! Lower you voice.
Hanaoka?
It's your shift at the ammunition storage.
Hello.
Your candies.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hanako!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Wow! You bought candies.
So cute.
Come on, let's go. Bye!
Bye!
It's Ichiro!
Welcome! You've come a long way.
- This way please.
- Thank you.
It's spectacular.
All rise!
Be quiet!
Sing the national anthem.
Sing the national anthem.
Our Mikado rules the world
For generations to come
Like sands accumulating to rocks
Get him!
Stop!
Stop!
What's going on?
Keep playing! Come on!
Sing! Keep singing!
Keep singing!
Play it!
Keep singing!
Like sands accumulating to rocks
Get him!
Here comes the blood sacrifice!
Come on!
Run! Come on!
Hatsuko! Hatsuko!
Hatsuko!
Come on! Unlock the storage
The savages are hunting heads.
Hanaoka!
Unlock that one too!
Chief Mouna,
my wife Obing is still dressed in kimono.
Shut up! Open the door!
Run for your lives!
I'm a descendant from a samurai as well.
- Mr. Satsuka!
- Mr. Commissioner!
- Mr. Satsuka!
- Come on!
Mr. Satsuka!
Hide in there! Be quiet!
Hush! Be quiet!
Aren't you a savage too?
Why are you hiding with us?
We're offering blood sacrifice
What are you daydreaming for?
Follow me!
Pawan! Pawan!
Come on! Hurry up!
Missed! Come on!
Damned Japanese! I'll make you weep!
Come with me!
Oh, my children, I know
In those passionate days
You've learned a song
To sing for the soon-be-forgotten
ancestral spirit
Every note tightly embraces
our ancestors' spirits
My children! What are you doing?
What on earth are you doing, my children?
Your dynamic bodies dance
to our ancestors' spirits
Dahdo! Dahdo!
Go to the school right now
to save your daughter Obing.
She's dressed in kimono.
No! No!
No enemy dares to gaze at it
Didn't we agree not to kill the Hans?
What are you chasing him for?
We did?
You'd better stay sober today!
Your hatred darkens the
heaven and the earth
Don't throw anything
hard stuff at me again!
Okay, fine.
The distant stars are nowhere to be seen
Hush! Hush!
Oh, see how the stars are dimming
My children!
The chilling light reflected off the tips
of your machetes
Makes the moon seem pale as wax
The bloodstain on the
tips of your machetes
Come on, Mr. Commissioner!
I can't run any more.
What are you talking about?
Come on!
Get up!
Someone's here!
- I'm exhausted.
- This way!
I really can't run any more!
Mr. Kikukawa!
I don't want to die here!
Tado, don't shoot!
Temu, you'd do anything
to become a hero, huh?
Look, I killed a high-ranking official.
Where's the other one?
Pihu...
Don't kill me. We're friends.
My friend...
I'm not killing people I'm offering
blood sacrifice to our ancestors.
Is that your teacher?
Oh, my children!
Teacher... My dear teacher...
You think we're a bunch of cowards?
I'm sorry. I was trying to educate you
I'd punish a Japanese kid
when he makes mistakes.
But you've been so mean to me!
Look! The reddened earth is silent
Look! The bark of Pusu
Qhuni is peeling off
You poor Japanese...
Come to the heavenly home of our ancestors
and be our friends forever.
Touch your bloodstained hands
Can they still hold the sand
from our hunting grounds?
Touch your angry forehead
Can a beautiful rainbow bridge
still be spread out over it?
Come here! You go there!
Come here!
Wait!
Have you seen my daughter Obing?
No.
Han... I'm a Han!
Go there!
Have you seen my daughter Obing?
Are you a Seediq from Toda?
Get lost!
Tell your chief Temu Walis
that we're offering blood sacrifice
to our Seediq ancestors.
Wushe has fallen into our hands
we Seediqs from Tgdaya.
Those of you from Toda and Truku
should join us as well.
Move over!
All the pinecones have broken in the wind
Chief Mouna?
Obing!
Obing!
Obing!
Obing!
Jiro!
- Obing!
- Jiro!
Obing!
I'm in here!
- Obing!
- Help me!
Move away!
Father!
Father!
Why must you hunt heads?
That lights up the stars in your souls
Your dreams are vast like a blue ocean
But the joyous tears in
your souls have dried out
Oh, my children! Do you know?
How much pain do you swallow
to sing the song of our ancestral spirit?
How much shame do you swallow
to speak what you want to say?
How much regret do you swallow
to fulfill your dreams?
Oh, children! What's wrong with you?
Oh, my children! What
exactly is wrong with you?
