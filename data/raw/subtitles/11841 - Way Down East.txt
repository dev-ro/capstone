WAY DOWN EAST
A Simple Story
of Plain People.
Since the beginning of time
man has been polygamous
- even the saints of Biblical
history - but the son of
Man gave a new thought.
and the world is growing
nearer the true ideal. He
gave of One Man for One
Woman.
Not by laws - our Statures
are now overburdened by
ignored laws - but within
the heart of man, the truth
must bloom that his greatest
happiness lies in his purity
and constancy.
Today Woman brought up
grom childhood to expect
ONE CONSTANT MATE
possibly suffers more than
at any point in the history
of mankind, because not
yet has the man-animal
reached this high standard
- except perhaps in theory.
If there is anything in this
story that brings home to
men the suffering caused by
our selfishness, perhaps it
will not be in vain.
Time and place - in the story
world of make-believe,
Characters; Incidents -
never occurred-yet always
happening.
Let us suppose a remote
village in New England.
Ana Moore and her mother.
We call her "Anna" -
we might have called her
"Woman" - for is not herw
the story -
Sore need of money drives
the mother to appeal to the
Tremonts, their rich
relatives in Boston.
Oh Mother, I hate to ask
them for money.
So, through the troubled
twilight...
All right Mother, I'll go.
THE DEPARTURE
Tell Cousin Emma I made
this hug-me-tight my
own hands.
The fashion paper says
these gloves are style in the
city.
An errand undertaken with
the tremulous footsteps that
ever mark the trail of the
"poor relation"
Her cousins, the Tremonts,
were giving a bridge whist
party the afternoon of
Anna's arrival.
Cousin Emma Tremon
Herself.
Diana Tremont,
her daughter.
An occasional interloper in
Society - The dashing
Lennox Sanderson, who
depends go his living upon
a rich father.
He has three specialties:
Women! Women! And
WOMEN.
There is a young person -
says she's your Cousin
Anna Moore - from
Greenville.
My dear child! Whatever
brought you here?
Well, you see, things
haven’t been going very
well - and we wanted to ask
you - if -
Courage failing, she
changes the subject to
the hug-me-tight.
I beg your pardon.
Mrs. Tremont imparts the
embarrassing news of the
country cousin's arrival to
her daughters.
Well, get rid of her.
But to impress their
eccentric, but enormously
rich aunt, the sisters
pretend to be nice to Anna.
I knew you both from
your pictures.
Yes, I expect to stay quite
a time - that is, if we suit
each other.
CHAPTER II
Near the country estate of
then Santerson family is
Bartlett Village.
Also the home of Squire
Bartlett, the richest farmer
in the neighborhood.
The clock hand points
to blossoms - and
awakening.
David Bartlett though of
plain stock, haw been
tutored by poets and
visions as the world.
Squire Bartlett, a stern
old puritan, who lives
according to his awn con-
seption of the Scriptures,
particularly the "Thou
Shalt Nots".
Mrs. Barlett, whose gentle
soul is as sweet as her
beloved Scriptures.
Day dreams of twenty-one.
The great Tremont ball -
the climax of the social
season.
Anna's dress that she and
her mother had made in case
she should go out in
Society.
It's quite all right - and
from the balcony you can
see uis dancing.
Solely to pique the sisters of
whom she is not over-fond,
the aunt makes different
arrangements for Anna.
Oh, Aunty! - This dress
- where’s the top?
Beneath the alcove
lights' golden glow.
Anna's delicate beauty a
whip to Sanderson's
laded appetite.
In your beauty lives again
Elaine, the lily maid, love
dreaming at Astolat.
Tell me more.
Cousin Emma hurries Anna
off to bed - perhaps in fear
of her own daughters being
outshone.
The susceptible Sanderson,
obsesed by a new desire.
Sanderson, after managing
several meetings, finally
lures Anna to the apartment
to meet a mythical aunt.
Wait - I'll call Aunty.
Strange, she isn't here.
Just five minutes! She'll be
back any time.
If she doesn't come in five
minutes - I must go.
You don't understand...
I mean... I want you to...
to marry me.
Anna's inexperienced heart
caught in a tide of
infatuation.
Oh, I' m just going to
tell everybody.
But Sanderson, dreading to
cross the wishes of his rich
father, upon whom he is de-
pendent, persuades Anna to
promise secrecy.
Sanderson belongs to a
class which, if it cannot get
what is wants in one way, it
will go to any length to get
it in another.
Evil plans.
Passion's urge knows no
conscience and various its
ways to betrayal.
Sanderson induces Anna to
marry secretly before going
home.
Far away it happens that
David Bartlett is dreaming a
troubled dream.
Don't worry... everything's
all right. Don't you
trust me?
So... it is done.
The bridal suite at
Rose Tree Inn.
To her it is the fulfillment
of the dreams of girlhood
- to him but another
adventure.
Here conscience knocks at
the door... perhaps the
slightest interruptions might
still avert this tragedy,
but...
My... my husband!
The afternoon the Bartlett
post office was robbed.
The dread minion of the
Law - Rube Whipple,
Constable.
Seth Holcomb waiting for
Martha Perkins, whom he
has been following around
for twenty years.
Seth takes his liquor
under tha name of
"Long Life Bitters".
Martha Perkins, a relic,
nobody needs newspaper
when she is around.
The Constable on the
man hunt.
Napoleon, his fiery steed.
Napoleon refuses to
climb the hill.
The temptation of
Napoleon.
These men! I just can't
keep tem from following
me.
Great news! Post office bin
robbed! Dollar eighty-two
cents in postage stamps,
eighteen postal cards!
Heavy loss to the
government.
I'll 'low bno man to laugh at
the law, Seth Holcomb.
The both win.
Charter IV.
One day of the honeymoon
before Anna starts home
with her great secret.
Promise now.
Only two days!
Anna's return home.
Anna relieves her mother's
anxiety with happy mysterious
hints of wealth to come.
The old way too pleasant
to give up.
Less and less frequent
their secret meetings
until at last...
In answer to her urgent
letter...
All right. I'll wait.
You haven't told anyone
aboyt our marriage?
She tells him of a tender
new reason why the secret
cannot be kept any longer.
You mustn’t tell ANYONE.
Well...
Well... if you MUST know
The truth...
Because we aren't
married at all!
You’re just joking...
tell me, aren't you joking?
WE MUST be married...
see... see... our ring...
Marriage would have meant
my losing everything...
I intended to make
it right... but...
For Heaven's sake, don't
make a scene! I'll let you
have lots of money and you
can go away.
Mother! Mother!
When the mother returns...
Some time afterwards - left
alone by her mother's death
- Anna hides away with
her shame in the village of Belden.
Maternity:
Woman's Gethsemane.
Shadows across the time dial.
---------------------------------
The baby without a name.
My child, your baby
is very sick.
Ten drops of this in a little
water every hour until
I return.
Where's your husband?
Oh... he's away.
The landlady solemnly
reminds Anna that if the
baby dies without being
baptized, it will never see Got.
Helpless and alone in the
dreadful hours of the night,
and stricken with a terrible
fear for her baby's soul...
she herself performs
the sacred rite.
In the name of the Father,
and of the son...
and of the Holy Ghost...
I baptize thee...
TRUST LENNOX.
The vigil.
The little hands grow cold
upon her breast.
My child, your baby
is dead.
Sanderson on his country
estate at Bartlett.
Everybody is talking about
you having no husband.
I guess you'll have to leave.
Upon her back the
age-old Cross.
---------------------
The Pilgrimage.
Hi Holler, the Barlett's
chore boy, sprucing op
in the barn to meet Kate,
the Squire's niece.
A reckless spectator.
Oh! Hi! Hi Holler! Hurry
up! It's time to fetch Kate!
Anna, in search of work,
reaches Barlett Village.
Kate, the Squire's niece,
returns from a short trip
to Boston.
The Professor, summer
boarder at Squire Barlett's.
pursues his studies.
Is this the young niece
you were expecting from
Boston?
I am looking for work.
Work? You don't 'pear to
have no strength to work.
Where ye from?
Whose your folks?
I haven't any folks.
For all we know she
might be some loose woman
wanderin' 'round. I won't
take her inter my hum!
Sorry, young lady, but I
ain't got nothing for yet.
Inasmuch as ye have done
it unto one of the least of
these... ye have done it
unto me!
That's Scripture, Father.
All right, Mother, we'll try
her. Nobody can't ever say
I went aging the Scriptures!
Whatever your troubles,
child, remember, the Lord is
your Shepherd, you shall
not want.
Kate's Homecoming.
It has been settled by the
Squire and David’s childhood
that they are to marry,
Open admiration.
The Professor, meeting
Kate, is converted to the
scientific theory of Love
at first sight.
Oh, Professor, my shoe
is untied.
Well, well, neighbor
Sanderson, haven’t seen
you since Kate went away.
Kate - Sanderson's
newest infatuation.
David, you'll have time
before supper to show
Neighbor Sanderson that
heifer he wants to buy.
What are you
doing here?
I am working.
You can't stay here.
I live right across
the way.
Come right in, Mr. Sanderson!
Supper's ready.
You father was right.
I'm afraid I'm not strong
enough for this work.
Release don't do away,
Miss Moore! I... we all...
like you very much.
You'll get stronger after
awhile, and...
Anna! David!
Come right in.
END OF PART I
WAY DOWN EAST
Part II
Meanwhile, Anna, her past
still a closed book, has
become a beloved member
of the household.
Knowing only Anna's
blameless life among them,
David thrilled with the
thought that she is the
virginal white flower of his
dreams.
By the river and the distant
music of the falls - Around
them the sweet scent of
summer fields.
The David points out the
two forks of the river,
that go into one...
And all a thrill with
a great sincere love,
Visions to her
how they two might go,
On through life together...
One heart for one heart,
One soul for one soul,
One love for one love,
Even through Eternity.
At last the freat over-
whelming love - only to be
halted by the stark ghosts
of her past.
I am only trying to say I
love you, Anna - it seems
I've always loved you!
So she tells him he must
never speak like this
again.
The summer goes,
the winter comes,
We cannot rile the year,
Nor can we rule
the barque of Fate,
Nor all its strange ways
steer.
The Professor's love...
burdened heart brings him
down to the country to see
Kate.
I'm going ter read yer
some funny jokes.
Why does a chicken
cross the road?
None of the rooster’s
Business.
Ain't that funny?
Three eggs, two bad.
Miss Kate, I want to ask...
if you will...
be... my...
The ice is going out soon.
When the river starts you'd
better look out down below
there!
Anna goes ton the store after
forgotten goodies for the
big party planned for the
evening.
The villain still
pursues her.
The sewing circle next to
the grocery store.
Maria Poole, the landlady
from Belden, visits Barlett.
That's Anna Moor
lives down to Squire
Barlett's.
Moore? Her name ain't
Moore...
She lived at my house.
Mrs. Lennox, she called
herself... but she never had
no husband at all!
And then...
there was a baby!
The Squire thinks it time
that David and Kate come to
an understanding.
It's my bounden duty to go
and expose this woman to
the Squire.
Father's set on getting
married but I don't think we
can without proper love...
do you?
Suppose, Squire, I had
been like you suspected
when you first saw me?
Would there be any hope of
forgiveness?
When the law's broke. it's
broke, ain't it? A wrong’s a
wrong and nothing can make
it right.
Of course...
I was just supposing.
On their way to the
big barn dance.
Maria Poole, from Belden,
was at the sewing circle and
she says...
No. I shouldn't tell you!
It's that...
Oh, it's awful...
But before Martha tells
her thrilling news...
On their way to the big
party, they stop to warm up
at the Squire's with an old-
fashioned dance.
No, I am not invited
to the party,
The Professor,
dazed but happy.
All bound 'round a woolen string!
A great big hat with a great big brim.
All bound 'round, all bound 'round.
All bound 'round with a woolen string!
David, for some reason,
suddenly discovers he is not
interested in the party.
The neighbors' barn dance.
Moro and worried
by Anna's presence...
also afraid she will
interfere in his pursuit of
Kate - Saderson -
I can't have you around
here where I live!
Suppose they find out
about your past life?
You'd have to fet out
them!
Suppose they find out
about YOUR past life!
Oh, it's different with a
MAN! He's supposed to sow
his wild oats.
At last Martha gets her
opportunity with the
Squire.
Does Lennox Sanderson
mean anything to you?
Why do you ask
such question?
Because I can't keep silent
any longer.
I love you! I want you
to be my wife.
It's about Anna Moore.
She lived in Belden under
the name of Lennox.
Mrs. Lennox.
A baby was born,
but there ware not no wedding
ring to the finger.
No, father...
you must have proof.
I'll go to Belden in
the morning...
and if it is true...
Please! Please don't!
I can never be ANY
MAN'S WIFE!
The next morning. The
Squire on his way to
Belden to investigate
Martha's story.
The Squire's on important
business, isn't he?
So happens that
Sanderson...
At noon Squire arrives
in Belden.
It's all true. Why, her
baby was born in this
very room.
Late afternoon.
Roses in wintertime!
Lan' sakes!
Don't want no supper
of your getting!
The time's come for you to
get your things and get out
of this house!
Don't want no words!
Just get out!
It means she is going to
get out of my house!
I found out all about her...
she ain't fit to be here!
She's the mother
of a baby, but she ain't got
NO HUSBAND!
Tell them it's a lie,
Anna!
I... I can't!
You found out so much!
Why didn't you find out the
whole truth?
That I was an ignorant girl
betrayed through a mock
marriage.
This man... an honored
guest at your table...
why don't find out what
HIS life haw been?
For HE is the man who
betrayed me!
And then the storm.
The sugar camp.
Anna's lost in the storm...
get out men...
quick!
Frenzied... tortured...
The calling river.
The storm lulls.
The great ice-break.
The ice jam gives way...
rushing to the falls.
Quick! Quick!
The Doctor!
Toward morning.
The Squire asks
forgiveness.
Come, Anna, I know I
didn't the right thing. I'm
willing to marry you now if
you want me.
I... I will.
I will.
Interested witnesses.
Seth, wilt thou have this
woman to be the wedded
wife...?
I... I will.
The one man for
the one woman,
Between them the
Sacramental bond...
Life's cleanest and sweetest.
