Lisa.

Michael Trent.
I don't know who that is.
He's the editor in chief
of The Grackle.
The lit mag.
The high school
literary magazine.
Does he lunch on or off campus?
-Off.
-BK or White Castle?
Neither.
Does he have
more of a basketball bod
or a football bod?
He doesn't play sports.
He's cerebral.
He's in a wheelchair?
No.
This party's going to be clutch.
There's going to be two kegs,
a wapatui,
and Eric Chen stole
a nitrous tank
from his dad's dental practice.
-Isn't it just off Bluff Road?
-Uh-huh.
We could've walked.
Too far. I'm wearing jellies.
These things will turn your
feet into Hamburger Helper.
But there's a shortcut
through the forest
through Bachelor's Grove.
The haunted cemetery?
It's not haunted.
It's just abandoned.
Desecrated.
Well, I heard the heshers
do witchcraft over there.
And I also heard
that Gina Marzak
dedicated her unborn child
to Satan.
And that's why the baby
has to wear a helmet now.
I've never seen anybody there.
I think it's really peaceful
and quiet.
I do wax rubbings
of all the tombstones.
I have a favorite.
-You have a favorite one?
-Yeah.
A young man.
I tend to his grave
and leave him flowers and...
I talk to him sometimes.
I brought this for you.
It was my mom's.
It's kind of morbid
when I wear it,
so I wanted you to have it.
Keep it safe, okay?
That's really weird, Lisa.
I just don't think anyone
should be forgotten.
♪ Swept away... ♪
-Hi!
-Hi!
I brought the booze.
-Yes, you did!
-You look great.
You look hot.
Hey, you fixed your bangs.
You know, I wasn't
gonna say anything,
they were such a mess,
but you look amazing now.
I'm telling you, we're taking

-What?
-The booze.
It's in the house.
Yeah, I think that my
stepsister brought most of it.
Lisa Swallows.
Michael Trent.
Why?
How do you know my name?
Well, we're both
currently being educated
in the same walls of asbestos.
Plus, you submitted some really
strong poems to The Grackle.
I'm the editor.
Oh, you are? Right.
Your stuff's really good.
Like, pitch-black,
but really good.
Reminds me of Plath
or Anne Sexton.
You like my poems?
I wouldn't have published them
if I didn't.
So, what exactly
happened to her?
I've heard stuff.
I can never,
ever talk about it, Lori.
For personal and legal reasons,
and I also pinky-swore.
But I guess I can tell you.
I trust you.
You're my cheer sister.
Of course.
Okay, so, like, two years ago,
Lisa was home alone
with her mom,
and this psycho broke in.
With, like,
an axe and everything.
Anyway, her mom told her to run
and hide, and so she did.
And then the guy
axe-murdered her mom,
and she heard the whole thing.
Oh, my God.
She called 911,
but the guy escaped.
They never caught him.
And by the time she came out,
it was too late.
Wow.
I'd be screwed up
if I were her, too.
Yeah.
She didn't talk
for a few months after that.
Kind of just wandered around
like a zombie.
What about her dad?
Is he okay?
Oh, yeah. Dale?
He's a big sweetie.
My mom met him
six months after the murder,
and they got engaged
and married real quick.
Which is great, you know?
Because Dale didn't
have to be sad for too long
and Lisa had a new mom
right away.
-Aw!
-That's so cute.
Yeah.
Everything worked out nice.
-So, like...
-Hey.
-I found the keg.
-Oh. Thank you.
It's Clydesdale piss,
but, you know...
Hey, Tamara.
Hi. Sorry, how do we
know each other?
-Just a couple classes.
-This year?
This semester.
Bless.
-Uh, anyway...
-Mm-hmm.
...do you want a sip?
Uh...
-I'll take one.
-No, right.
Why would I assume
that she parties?
All right, I'll take one.
-Oh.
-Let me see that real quick.
What?
-What is this?
-You know, I'm not really sure.
-I got it off, um, Darren?
-Come on.
-What? -Poor girl just
went from Pepsi Free to PCP.
You're being so dramatic.
Hey, Lisa. You okay?
I saw you
talking to those darksiders.
Did they give you something?
This is not
what I expected from you.
You have so much potential,
Lisa.
Hey, you. We need to talk.

Lisa? Lis? Hey.
My mom's having a cow
about the bathroom.
You should probably get up.
Come on, now.
That's fine. Everyone does it.
Oh, my God.
So, what happened last night?
Oof. Your knees.
I fell.
Sure, babe. Me, too.
Lisa!
Get down here now!
You should probably get going.
Oh. Lisa.
Did you smash the mirror
in the bathroom?
Last night, I, uh...
Told you.
Your dad wanted to give you
the benefit of the doubt,
but I knew.
I always know.
I'm an I.P.
Intuitive person.
Took a whole seminar about it.
Janet.
There was a damn tornado
last night.
Hail damage on the sedan,
yard full of debris,
and now I guess I got
to clean up the bathroom, too.
It was a tornado watch, Mom,
not a real tornado.
Well, now, it was
quite a storm, though, Taff.
You see that ball lightning?
Big green ball in the sky?
Never saw anything like that.
Dale.
You need to stop
munching the Grape-Nuts
and be a father right now.
Your daughter has a taste
for vandalism.
She has been deliberately
destroying property.
First, it was my...
Precious Moments cake stand.
That was an accident.
Mom.
Be nice.
I am being nice.
But I will not coddle her.
No one coddled me
when my dad blew up in Da Nang.
And that is why I am
the way I am today.
That's a good point.
Thank you, honey.
Lisa, do you know what happens
to people who act out?
They wind up in the loony bin.
You're a psych nurse, Mom.
Should you be saying
"loony bin"?
Zip it, Taff.
All right, Lisa.
You're gonna go upstairs
and you're gonna clean up
that bathroom.
And, um...
pay for the mirror.
Yeah, I'll pick up
an extra shift at Wayne's.
How about an apology?
I'm sorry, Janet.
Wait a second here.
What is this?
Thanks, Laura.
I'm here on the scene
at the former sight
of the Bachelor's Grove Cemetery
in Bremer Park,
where a neglected monument
was recently
struck by lightning...
...reigniting neighborhood
concerns about fire safety.
Oh.
Hey.
Hello.
I-I feel like
I want to apologize
for what may have
happened last night.
I had no idea
that cup was spiked.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
It was good.
Uh, that was... I got high.
So you're
an experienced psychonaut.
You know, like, um...
like an astronaut of the psyche
type thing?
Oh, yeah, I'm the...
Sally Ride of...
drugs.
Can I help you, young man?
Uh, yes, sir. Um...
just spilt a little something
on the inside here.
Red wine?
-Hawaiian Punch.
-Mm-hmm.
Anyway, well,
I'm glad you're okay.
Do you two know
each other from school?
I didn't know
Lisa had any friends.
I can always count on her
to work on Saturdays
'cause she can't get a date.
Eh, it's probably
'cause she's so flat-chested.
Hey. Can they get it out?
I'll do my best, sweetheart.
But I'm a technician,
not a magician.
-Thank you.
-That's a shame.
Hi, Lisa.
Um, well, thank you.
-Lisa, it was really good
seeing you. -Bye.
Lisa.
Hmm.
And that's why
Mr. Conyers has to teach
with the door open now.
Oh, you're a riot, Taff.
Hey, Lis.
We're going to the late show
of Look Who's Talking.
Want to come?
Oh, is there pizza left?
Uh, yeah.
I think we got a slice here.
Oh. Looks like it's got
a little meat on it.
Oh, she can pick it off.
I said we should get you
a veggie lovers',
but I guess she had
some coupon thing.
Eh? Free Orange Crush?
Yeah, I think
I'm gonna skip the movie.
-Huh?
-No, what?
Lisa.
Lis, come on.
We all have to spend
more time together as a family.
How can we Brady
if we don't bunch?
-Right, Dad?
-That's right.
I'm just really tired from work.
How tiring can it be
to sit hunched
over a sewing machine
like an old lady?
Taff just had
a three-hour cheer practice.
-Mom...
-They have her doing
the splits on the top
of the damn pyramid.
Do you know how hard that is
on the groin muscles?
It doesn't even hurt anymore.
Well, because you put in
the work.
All those hours screaming
with your legs spread
against the wall.
Heck yeah,
you should be proud, Taff.
Well, I'm sure Lisa's fingers
hurt from all that sewing.
Eventually, a callus just forms.
Don't I know it?
Mm.
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Hmm?
You hear that?
I'm sure
it's the girl next door.
She's very odd.
-The cheerleader?
-No, no.
Not Taffy. She's adorable.
-Stop it!
-And what a figure.
It's the other girl.
I'm calling 911!

I thought
you were going to Milwaukee.
Don't you "Milwaukee" me.
I skipped the conference
because I'm ill.
And do you know why I'm ill?
Aunt Flo?
No.
Because a little psycho whore
put worms on my diet plate.
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.
I should've gone
to the doctor,
but I had to go
take care of others,
like I've been doing
for 20 years.
Because I am a nurse
and an angel.
I even opened my glorious home
to an ungrateful little bitch.
Well, I didn't want
to move here.
Oh, you wanted
to stay in the house
where your mom was butchered
like a hog?
Oh, that-that's
disturbing, Lisa.
I mean, I didn't want to go
to a new school my senior year.
I didn't want to leave the town
that I lived in my whole life.
So ungrateful.
You were lucky
to get out of there.
I'm sure people were talking.
Or maybe you liked
being a hot topic.
Maybe it was the first time
anyone ever looked at you.
Shut up!
Oh, that's it.
You should know that today,
I talked to the head
of the juvenile program
at Serenity Manor,
and you are being admitted.
Oh, please, no.
Oh, yes.
For your own good and my safety.
Inpatient.
Lockdown.
Special socks.
Where a disturbed person
like you belong...
Why?! Why?
Oh. No, I can't.
I can't do that.
Not until we bury the body.
Is it peaceful down there?
Can you hear anything?
No reception?
Dead meat.
Well, maybe
it could just be for looks.
Like my cousin Carlene--
she got a boob job.
She can't feel anything,
but she still got a husband.

Oh, my God.

Can you... Yeah?
Oh, my God! It worked!

No.
It's Lisa.
Did she just make a joke?
It wasn't very good.
Is that my new half shirt
from Contrampo?
You said sisters share.
You're right. I did.
You look deadly.
Half the school is headed
to boner town,

I did.
You never heat-style
before a practice.
Are you the crimper police?
Are you from Conair PD?
No, it's just that your hair's
not even crimped.
Well, you know that my hair
is too healthy
and too silky to hold a crimp.
Right.
It's, like, my main flaw.
-Yeah.
-Bye, Daddy.
Okay.
-Let's get going.
-Be careful.

Hey.
I'm so glad that you came.
You... you don't want
to hold my hand?
Oh, I will.
But first, I want to take you
somewhere that's...
very meaningful to me.
Uh, I don't think
I've ever heard you talk
this much.
It's weird.
I suppose I never thought
I had much to contribute,
but I feel much more
extroverted lately.
I want to participate
in the school community.
I didn't know we were going
for a hike.
Oh.
Why are we at Bachelor's?
Oh. Have you been here before?
Mm-hmm. Once.
Uh, in the seventh grade
on a dare.
Mm-hmm.
This whole place gives me
the creeps, okay?
It-it's not Christian,
okay, for a graveyard
to be left like this.
I agree.
It's not Christian.
Okay.
-Ooh.
-Okay.
I want you to touch me
exactly the way
you touched me at the party.
Oh, I knew you wanted it.
All right, so, uh, well, I had
a bunch of beers, you know,
which is... which is probably
why I was so good at it.
--Uh, you know,
because I was relaxed.
But I think it
might have been...
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Aha!
I told you I'd hold
your stupid hand!
Why would you
do that, Lisa? -
What? I thought that was
a really cool thing to say.
Ow! Help!
My hand! My hand...
This is gonna be tough.
Ooh.
Hmm.
Oh.
No, no.
Whoa!
Oh. Oh.
What? Where are we going?
Oh, my God.
Okay.
What?
What are you doing?
Oh, you're a musician.
Okay.
Was that, like,
Mozart or something?
You had a whole life.
Yeah, I guess, yeah, I do.
I guess so.
Oh, no, uh, that's Dad's.
He hasn't played
since my mom died.
You can try.
Yeah.

When you cry, it smells like

Oof.
Oh, Jesus.
God!
What's wrong?
What?
Hey.
Don't feel bad
about what we did.
Janet was gonna put me
in a psych ward.
You saved me.
And Doug?
Eh. We just wanted his hand.
And now look what you can do
with it. That hand...
was gonna do terrible things.
And now it's a... it's a conduit
for the talent
of REO Speedwagon.
Look, I got to go change my pad,
and you got to get upstairs
for the night
'cause they're gonna
be home soon, so...
♪ Fight this feeling

So, I think we'll call
that one finished,
and from all of us here...
Guys! I finally got
my standing back tuck.
It was a little off
the cheese mat, but still,
Coach said it counts.
Oh, that's fantastic.
Thanks, Daddy.
Oh, wait, I got to go tell Mom.
Taffy, wait.
Doesn't she get back tomorrow?
Just tell her then.
Lisa, this is a big D.
Mom said that if I got
my back tuck,
she'd finally give me
her diamond studs.
That's so nice.
Yeah, it is. What's the number
for the hotel again?
Yeah, it's, uh, in there
on the fridge.
And, Taff,
holler before you get off.
I want to talk to Mom, too.
-Sure thing.
-Me, too.
I want to talk to her, too.
-Okay.
-When you get her on the phone.
"Back tuck."
I think I'm gonna go up
to my room.
I got a really big
pop quiz tomorrow.
I thought a pop quiz
was a surprise.
Oh, that's illegal now.
Because a kid, uh...
he had a heart attack.
And died.
Yeah.
Oh, whoa.
Lisa.
What is up with your nails?
I, um...
Wite-Out?
Is that a rad new trend
or something?
Yeah.
All the kids are doing it,
you know? Hmm?
The suspect's in custody,
but they're not releasing
any information
until they complete
their investigation.
Mama.
That's Starlight Rosebud
Hella Good Girl
Gonna Need a Big Bank.
But I just call her
Niblets Corn.
I don't play
with dolls anymore.
Mama.
Oh. Sixth grade.
I was in band for a month.
Then I got, like, a weird...
mouth fungus.
It hurt.
Don't touch it.
Um, that's like a...
it's like a...
back massager.
Lisa?
Lis?
Lis?
I just called my mom's hotel,
and they're saying
that she never checked in.
Mama.
Anyway, there's no one there
by her name.
I tried using her new
last name, her old last name,
her old-old last name,
then I called 411
and tried calling the other
Radisson in Milwaukee.
I called all the Radissons
in Milwaukee.
You did a lot of calling.
-Yeah.
-Well...
I'm sure there's some
explanation.
What if she's been kidnapped?
What if...
the kidnappers drugged her?
And then forced her to
call home and say she was okay?
Just as they would do in every
Unsolved Mystery episode.
No, Taffy!
Taffy, Taffy, no, no, no!
It's okay.
Let's not jump to conclusions.
Lisa, you know I'm usually
pretty cool about things, right?
-Yeah.
-I'm a loose goose.
-I'm Laffy Taffy.
-Mm-hmm.
But I have a bad feeling
about this.
I'm an I.P., intuitive person.
-Mm-hmm.
-Just like my mom.
No.
I know when something's wrong.
Janet...
will be home tomorrow.
Everything...
will be fine.
Lisa, you have no idea
how scary this is.
You don't have to worry
about anything
because your mom's
already been murdered.
Ah. You have a point there.
-I'm sorry.
-No.
You're right.
Oh, my God.
I have to go tell Dad.
Shit.
Mm, mm.
Oh, thank you. That's helping.
Mm-hmm.
My Aunt Shelley gave it
to me for Christmas.
She said it might
improve my personality.
You want me to do you?
Do you, um...
do you feel anything
in your body?
Must be kind of uncomfortable
sleeping in the closet.
Yes, uh, she left Monday
at approximately 4:00 p.m.
Uh, hair...
Um, kind of multicolored?
-Brown... -No, it-it's
more like, you know,
like a... like a Labrador
when you see it at the park,
and the sun just hits it...
just right and...
you can see
its chocolatey brown coat
and it has, like, highlights
of, like, red.
It's so beautiful.
Uh, yeah.
So...
Right, brown.
We're running out of time.
They're gonna find Janet.
I'm feeling...
very tense, like,
a lot of stress tension.
Oh.
Her eye color?
She has hazel eyes.
But she wears
green contact lenses
to enhance them and, um...
she has a manicure,
French manicure, square.
You know, um...
...people don't always
put that on their back.
Hmm?
Sometimes they use it...
other places.
She has a cross pendant,
and she's wearing
Elizabeth Taylor
White Diamonds perfume.
Yeah. Yeah.
She's a bitch.
Shh.
We could, like...
try it if you want.
Hmm?
She's just, uh,
an unselfish person.
But I always say,
"Better safe than sorry."
Right?
Okey-doke.
Yeah. You, too.
Oh, my God!
What if she's dead?
Oh, for heaven's sake, Taff.
I once called a psychic hotline,
and the lady who answered--
she was an actual Jamaican--
told me that my mother and I
share a heart.
And I actually feel
like something's wrong.
Well, let-let-let's not assume
the worst.
She's probably off in some bar
having a Dirty Banana.
And you know
what song she's plugging
into that jukebox.
"Kokomo."
"Kokomo."
That's right.
After my mom died,
everyone was in such a hurry
to go back to normal.
And they kept acting
like I had a problem
because I couldn't stop
missing her.
Started to feel
like I was going crazy.
I thought
that was gonna last forever,
but it didn't, you know?
And pretty soon, everybody...
seemed like they were
almost excited
to move on and forget about her.
They kept saying,
"Time heals all wounds."
But that's a lie.
Time is the wound.
Takes you further and further
from that place
when you were happy.
Makes those good smells go away.
People are so afraid of death...
...'cause they don't know
when it's gonna happen to them.
It could be an axe murderer,
could be the flu,
but they don't know
and they hate that, so...
I'm not afraid of death anymore.
Mm-mm.
But I don't want
to die a virgin.
Did you?
Oh, come on.
You're not gonna tell me?
Mm-mm.
Excuse me.
I tell you everything.
One?
Wow.
Just once?
Hmm.
That's crazy.
Did you love her?
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
I want that.
I want to do it
with someone I truly love.
Like...
Michael Trent.
Oh, my God. I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.
I mean, we don't know
what's gonna happen.
We killed two people.
I could get the clink for life
or the electric chair.
God. That's like a tanning bed
but for criminals.
Mm. I'm just gonna do it
tomorrow.
I'm just gonna offer my body
to him.
Taffy says that you have to
show guys you love them
instead of telling them,
and I...
You know, I think
it's a pretty good idea.
What do you think?
Mm.
I knew you'd think so.
You're so supportive.
Well...
I love our conversations.
Yeah.
Good night.

Doug Moranz?
Wh-Who's that?
I don't know.
I think he's a junior?
None of us know him.
He's a "not pictured."
But I guess he didn't
come home last night.
They've got a search party out.
Trevor Miggs told me.
His dad's a detective.
This is just too freaking much.

Take a seat, Miss Swallows.
As you may have heard,
it's been a difficult day.
A student is missing.
We were wondering
if you know of anything
about the disappearance
of Doug Moranz.
We know he was
a friend of yours.
He was just my lab partner.
Well, this young lady here
says that you had plans
to meet up with Doug
after school yesterday.
Can you tell us
what you saw again?
Yeah, um, I have the locker
right next to Doug's,
so when I went to get something
that I forgot,
I saw her slip a note
into his locker.
It said that Lisa
wanted Doug to meet her
at Papoose after school.
-And did he meet you there?
-No.
-He stood me up.
-Well, that's funny,
'cause we have
multiple witnesses
saying they saw a young man
with the description of Doug
at Papoose Lake.
One witness said he saw a girl
with your description.
There's lots of girls
who look like me.
Specifically mentioning
someone with a funny walk,
thick ankles.
What?
Hey, Janet, are you home?
Suki from down the street
just came into work
and said she saw your car
over on Glenview Terrace.
Hey, uh, maybe we can
squeeze in a little "Kokomo"
before the girls get home.
Wait for me.
You should check her purse.
I bet it's chock-full of drugs.
Are you... are you
kidding me right now?
She's off her rocker!
She needs help!
You know there's a rumor
that she killed her own mother.
-What?! You shut up!
-So I would check...
-Stop it! -All right,
all right, all right.
Pull harder.
What are you,
a little fruitcake, huh?
Oh, hell no. What the hell?
Hey!
Hey, you!
I'm not making
any more comments.
You can talk to my lawyer.
Really hope
this goth phase ends soon.
What are you doing there? Huh?
This is my neighborhood.
And you don't need to be here.
So carry your ass on out,
or me and you gonna go after it
right here.
God...
Goddamn it!
That good-for-nothing,
nosy bitch!
Ugh.
What are you doing?
Shit is transpiring, man.
You have to take me
to Michael's.
He cut fourth period.
When he cuts, he either goes
to Rocky Rococo's
or he goes home, and his car
was not at Rocky Rococo's.
Why is this Club bloody?
Did you beat someone
with The Club?
It's not that kind of club, man.
It's an anti-theft device.
Turn right on Hawthorne.
Right here.
What are you doing?
You don't think I should do it?
It's 1989.
People have sex out of wedlock
all the time these days.
Plus, I have a contraceptive
sponge in my purse.
It's enormous.
It's your fault we're screwed.
You killed Janet.
It wasn't my idea.
Okay, going after Doug
was my idea
but only because killing Janet
felt really good
and I was just an accomplice.
But now you're out of control.
You're beating people up,
driving around in plain sight.
There's probably an APB out
on this vehicle.
You don't even know
what that is.
You probably drove
one of those stupid
old-fashioned bicycles
with the one big wheel.
You did.
Take me to Michael's.
It's not a horse
and carriage, for God's sake.
There it is.
It's the redbrick colonial.
I've driven past here
so many times.
He's home.
Okay.
You know...
you act like you're happy for me
and you care about me,
but you're not really
happy for me.
We're gonna talk
about this after.
Stay in the car.
Don't let anyone see you.
I'm sorry if this is too much.
I know it's all so new.
Things have been moving fast
ever since the party,
but I want that.
Even if we're
from different worlds?
That's what makes it magic.
You're just so cute,
sweet, pure.
I'm so dark and screwed up.
It's called polarity.
I'm really sorry, I just...
Oscar Wilde said,
"To define is to limit."
Are you the crimper police?
Are you from Conair PD?
-Oh, my God, Lisa!
-Holy...
"Sisters share," huh?!
You have everything!
You couldn't let me have
this one thing?
You knew I liked him,
and you went after him
on purpose.
Not on purpose. I swear,
I would never do that to you.
It's just... guys usually
only want me for one thing.
Yeah, and you just gave it out
like a cheese cube
from Hickory Farms.
He made me feel like
I was more than
just a stupid cheerleader.
Yeah, y-you can't blame her,
kiddo.
It just was never gonna
work out between us.
I-I don't have feelings
for you like that.
-I'm sorry.
-Why?
Because I'm not sweet
and simple like her?
Not enough polarity for you,
Werner Heisenberg?
You like cool movies
and music and stuff,
but only for you.
You want to be the smart one
who likes cool stuff,
and you don't want your
girlfriend to like cool stuff.
Do you know how uncool that is?!
Uh, you're not making any sense.
-Oh, my gosh.
-Who...
-What-What's going on?

There was just no sweetness.

-I can't believe it.
What do you think happened?
-Is everybody out?
-I hope so.

No, not that I know of.

it's probably some sicko.
