Mother Joan Of The Angels
Bells
Why are they ringing?
That's the custom here.
For lost travellers
Bishop's orders
For people lost in the forest
It is dangerous to be in the forest
- What's your name?
- Juray
Going back tomorrow?
Yes. The monks want me
- Are you far from here?
- A whole day's journey
What thin slices you are cutting, Father
That way, you won't even know
you're eating bread
That's how we always cut bread
at the monastery
Why?
Why?
It's greed and gluttony
to devour large pieces
As I am a Wolodkowicz
You must be
an extraordinary glutton, Father
May God repay you
How about telling
the Father's fortune, Awdosia?
Why not? Priests too have fortunes
Many a maiden or woman...
...seeks her advice
before entering a convent
He'd like to...
He'd like to see his future too
but he can't
Tell him something about it
- What should I tell him?
- Everything
Whether his journey will be successful...
...and who he'll meet
He'll meet a maid who will be a mother
That's common enough in Poland
You poor, poor lamb
Poor, poor lamb
You'll love a crooked one
Blessed be the Lord
For ever and ever
The holy maids are waiting for you,
Father
And very impatient they are too
But no one knew I was coming
They know everything
But they tell lies sometimes
So you too have to come
to see the holy maids, Father?
Do you know
what's going on there?
What kind of holy maids they are?
Don't say such things
Leave it to the theologians.
You just pray and be silent
Sister Porteress even left the gate
open last night...
...for the priest who is to save them
How do you know
what's going on in the convent?
I do odd jobs there
Are men allowed in there?
What good is a woman
at chopping up big logs?
Or slaughtering a bull or a ram?
Surely the sisters do not eat meat
They do.
They say the devil tempts them
Guard us from malice, oh Lord!
I do believe
in our Holy Catholic Church...
...as I'm a Wolodkowicz
There's a village, Father...
...where everyone's a Wolodkowicz
The soil is poor there.
We grow just flax and oats
The apples are sour.
The flax is knotty, full of weeds
But the booze is as strong
as anywhere
Your health...
...Canon
- I'm not a Canon
- Then you will be
- To your heath
- To your health
It's time
I must go
You go to sleep, Juray
Get up early
Father Provincial wants you back
at once
Kaziuk
I must go to the convent
- Kaziuk will accompany you, Father
- May God repay you
Blessed be the Lord
For ever and ever
- He did have some vodka
- Not such a saint after all
They're all alike. All of them
Do your holy maids eat pork like us?
What for?
They have another kind of life
Don't talk so much.
You'll bring some mischief on us
In an evil hour
As I'm a Wolodkowicz,
tell us what's going on in that convent?
Are the devils at large
among the holy maids?
Stop that, sir
It's no joking matter
People are spying on each other
And reporting to the priests
Are there many priests in the convent?
Four. To do the exorcising.
This one's the fifth
In Father Garniec's case...
...there were 12 of them
who sentenced him to the stake
They had no reason
to burn Father Garniec
How about the holy maids?
Still dancing?
They're up to some better tricks
Is it true that Father Garniec
was a sorcerer?
Are you really sorry for him?
Not sorry
but it's a pity just the same
Even if he were the worst
What kind of man was he?
He was no saint
And he sizzled on the stake like a pig
How can they burn a man like that?
Go on, eat
How did they do it?
They just dragged him to the stake?
Did they take his clothes off?
The clothes catch fire first
So the man is left naked
Father Joseph
Welcome, Father Joseph
I'm Father Brym's housekeeper
Splendid, Krysia.
Now leave me alone with our guest
A priest is no guest
No. Go and play, children
Kaziuk
Poor lambs. They're my only comfort
- Orphans?
- Their mother is alive
Their father was burnt
They're Garniec's children
What future can they hope for?
The children of a priest
and a sorcerer
Do you believe he had bad intentions?
I may doubt his sorcery
but not his bad intentions
Did Satan get into him?
You'll have a hard task here, Father
I fasted and mortified myself
the whole autumn
I prayed and keep praying.
Yet I'm afraid of him
- Of whom?
- The Evil One
I never set foot in the convent
I have my parish and church
Father Garniec also kept away
but the women...
...I mean the nuns, were his undoing
True, he was young and handsome
While I'm old I won't come to
Mother Joan of the Angels in her dreams
Did Father Garniec come to her?
He apparently came
right through the convent walls
That's just the women's tales
You think so?
I do, but that's between us
The nuns wanted Father Garniec
to come to them
These maids or the demons in them...
...tell such things
at the top of their voices, in public
Saying where the devils sit in them
In church too. During exorcising
Such a shame. In church?
Tell this to the exorcising priests
They say if the people
see the devil...
...their faith in God
and the Church grows
That's why they show such things
to the people
Like tricks at a fair
Can you bring God to a man
through the devil?
Who knows, Father
It may not be such a bad way
Maybe saints are made that way
Unless...
Unless there are no devils
in there at all
Every woman
is naturally inclined to fall
And to be a saint
It's enough to look at the world
I don't know the world
I couldn't say
My mother became a Carmelite.
My sisters were nuns
I grew up among women
who were almost saints
It is well, dear Father,
that you're pious...
...and that you don't know women
I fear you'll have
some hard moments here
Pray for me, Father
What's worth the prayer of a sinner?
But pray I shall
Give me your blessing, Father
Come on, children. Let's go home
I'll see you to the convent, Father
Don't bother
It's more dignified
for a priest that way
- I don't care
- But we do
I'll always accompany you, Father.
We're good people
- All of you?
- Perhaps not all
Who knows before evening
what the day will bring?
Here we are
One of the sisters will open the gate
Sister Margaret
Mother Superior's been expecting you
since yesterday
Welcome, Father. It's good to see you
We've been longing for your help
Our common prayers will help us
Won't you sit down, Father?
For months we've been beset
by great miseries
The priests who are staying with us...
...have no power over them
Our only hope is in you, Father
I've been sent to take care
only of you
The other priests will look after
the sisters
If the spirits leave me,
they will leave the sisters too
It all started with me
I'll try to free you from your demon
Eight of them!
Behemoth, Balaam, Isacaaron...
...Gresil, Aman, Asmodeus,
Leviathan and Dog's Tail
Do not listen to them, my daughter.
Evil has many shapes and faces
How long is it
since you've been to confession?
Since we were first possessed,
half a year ago
That's a long time.
Why did you put off penance?
We didn't
The demons keep us away
from the holy sacraments
The demons keep you away?
Hasn't perhaps
your spiritual laziness...
...taken the shape of those demons?
You don't believe I'm possessed,
Father?
I have to, my child,
though unwillingly
Satan enters our souls in many ways
Oh, he's very powerful
We know little
about the nature of demons
And what they make the possessed
say is not to be trusted
You know they're the sons of falsehood
What is falsehood, Reverend Father?
And what is truth?
Every Christian's conscience...
...should tell him the difference
between black and white
Was it evil that Father Garniec
perished because of me?
Ask your conscience
If I told you what horrors
this man did to me
What abominable things!
I will tell you. I must
You have to know my inner life...
...all my torments, past and present...
...if you're to save me from the pit
of solitude where God has cast me
Calm yourself, my daughter
No one is alone on earth. No one
I saw him by my bedside
My Guardian Angel
He looked like Kaziuk from the inn
But he had such long hair,
down to his shoulders
He bent over me
and touched my breast
There were five drops of fragrant balm
on my gown
Forgive me. I've no one to tell
of my misery and horror
Defend me
Defend me, Reverend Father
All right
Go to your duties, my daughter.
I'll pray here
Then we'll think of our sins
and failings
Don't think it will be so easy...
...to drive me out of this sweet body
- Mother Joan!
- I'm not Mother Joan
I'm no one
Don't think we're afraid of your Latin
You filthy priest!
What is happening to you?
May God be blessed, Sister Margaret
- For ever and ever
- I thought you weren't coming today
There's so much work
with those exorcisms
The nuns pray
while you do all the work
I'm out of breath
I like it here
It's nicer among people
I'm very happy to see a representative
of the famous convent
You must have
some exciting tales to tell
What can I tell?
You come from the great world
But for you and your convent...
...we wouldn't be here at all
The exorcisms brought us here
The demons leave me alone
I seem to have a hard soul
and an undesirable body
The new priest
will do some real exorcising
He's too weak for our convent
He was as pale as death
after talking to Mother Superior
And she only did the trick
with the sooty door handle
Does Mother Joan cheat?
No. It's the devil who tells her
to blacken the handle every morning
- That's not cheating
- She mustn't cheat
She mustn't cheat. It has to be real!
We should have gone to the fair
to see the tightrope walkers
I don't like these fiendish nuns
A pity the demons don't lift their skirts
Sometimes they take off their clothes
Before Father Garniec was burnt...
...they used to run naked
in the garden and call him
Let's teach the nun to drink
Let's go
Sister, as I am a Wolodkowicz
Have a glass of mead, Sister
- Gracious, you're just like Tartars
- Take your chance, Sister
- No
- You have to sin at least once
- Drink, Sister, drink
- Dear God, what a brute
- Here's to the convent
- And to Mother Joan
Oh, my dear, dear mother
I would take the veil, please
Rather than a husband,
who would be a brute, please
Rather than a lover
with a stick to beat me
Rather than a thrashing
I would take the veil, please
I would rather sing
with the nuns in the convent
Than take me a husband
and much trouble with it
I would not mind singing Matins
at cold daybreak
If this could but save me
from a husband's beatings
Father Joseph is coming
What are you doing here,
my daughter?
I only came to see this woman
Go and sin no more
The devil is there and here too
That's how it is in this world
What do you know of the world?
- Do you, Father?
- Not much either
I have spent all my life in a monastery
Watch your step, Kaziuk
To hell with this axe
I know how you abhor
my coming to fight you
Here is your kingdom
but I've been sent in the name of God
I belong to another kingdom,
the Kingdom of Light
As you to the Kingdom of Darkness
I belong to Good and you to Evil
Kaziuk
- Do you believe in the devil?
- I do
- Have you seen him?
- I have
- With horns?
- Stupid
With wings
And with Mother Superior's face
- What did he look like?
- Don't be so curious
Tell me
I've never seen the devil
Nor have I
I didn't see him properly
But I saw him torment the sisters
Particularly our Superior
Mother Joan of the Angels
- Is that what she's called?
- Yes
Mother Joan of the Angels
She ought to be called
Mother of the Devils
It's awful to be alone in the world
What if the devil gets into me?
Devils don't care for the likes of us
You're only saying so
Sometimes I hate my dad so much
I could kill him
And if you kill your dad,
the devil will never let you go
Why kill your dad?
He'll die some day anyway
If he dies, he dies
But before he dies
he'll go on being bad
He beats Mother and me too
Pray for him
To hell with him
Say, "In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit
"God, guard my father"
That I can say. God guard my father
Now go to sleep
In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit
I am asleep
Good night
Satan!
I order thee to leave the body...
...of the most reverend
Mother Joan of the Angels
Leave her!
Leave her, Satan!
I won't! Whatever you do
I won't. I don't want to.
I don't want to
Balaam, Isacaaron, Asmodeus...
...Gresil, Aman, Leviathan
Speak, which of you is it?
It's Dog's Tail, at your service
Answer me, Dog's Tail
Wilt thou leave the body of this woman
if I order thee?
I will at once
but what about my brothers?
Balaam is in my head,
Gresil in my belly...
...and Asmodeus...
Satan, I order thee to leave her!
Dog's Tail has left me
I'm not Mother Joan
I'm Satan! My name is Gresil
Gresil. Satan
Thou didst not enter this woman
against God's will
Thou owest obedience
to those who speak in God's name
Wilt thou be obedient?
I will
Show us, Evil Spirit, how Seraphs
worship the Lord of Hosts
How do Seraphs
worship the Lord of Hosts?
Gresil...
Now show us
how kings praise the Almighty
I order thee in the name of God...
...to pay homage
to the sign of our salvation
Don't order him to do it, Father.
He'll torment me
Pay homage, I order thee!
No, I won't!
I won't pay homage
No earthly or heavenly power
can force me to do that
Humble thyself!
No. No!
Accursed be God the Father
and the Son and the Ghost...
...and the Blessed Virgin
and all Heaven!
Oh, Holy Cross. Oh, Holy Virgin
Forgive me all my blasphemies
Oh, God!
Oh, Lord, defend me from Satan
- Sister
- You frightened me again
- No more exorcising in church?
- There will be more
But Mother Superior is to be kept
in solitude
In solitude
Kneel down, Mother Joan
Kneel down, my daughter
Let us pray together
I'll say the prayers...
...and you try to communicate with me
in the spirit
May peace come upon you
Love drives Evil away
Fill yourself with love
Is it possible
not to give love for love?
Our Father who art in Heaven
Hosanna
We cleaned up the place nicely...
...but the pigeons are a nuisance
Tell Odrym to patch up the holes
in the roof
Yes, Mother Joan
There are so many
of those sweet birds
No one will disturb you here
Thank you, Sister
In solitude
you may get rid of your pride
Your greatest sin
Mother Joan,
when you're among people...
...you only think of your superiority
Who am I
but a poor servant of the Lord...
...who worships Him
in a remote convent?
I'm only a nun
What if my father is a prince
of an impoverished branch?
He sits in his Smolensk marshes.
No one knows him
Is it my fault that I'm possessed
by eight powerful demons?
Be good like a child.
Be happy like a child
God loves us very much
What if Satan leaves me
and takes possession of you?
God have mercy upon my sinful soul
There's no truth on earth
You utter words of despair again
After so many days of prayer,
so many nights of humility
Don't!
The devils are rising up in me again
You yourself are becoming a devil
Let go. Let go!
Father
- God be with you
- Father Joseph is out
I've come to see you
You have no idea what's going on
in the convent
No one is to move
a step outside the gate
They're making bars for Father Joseph
Mother Joan's been worse than ever
It looks as bad as with Father Garniec
Shut up!
It may be an evil hour
The squire too keeps coming back
to our muddy village
They say he's borrowing money
from local Jews
Stupid
Squires don't do such things
You know nothing about it
Don't I? When it started
with Father Garniec...
You must be surprised to see me back
But something drives me here
Are you so curious about the convent?
It's here, Father
What's the good of my coming here?
Who knows? He's a wise man
He always says,
"Don't ask for trouble
"It comes uninvited"
Please, come in
The rabbi is expecting you
You must be surprised
Not at all. I've been expecting
to see one of you here
- You know?
- I do
What are they?
A priest asking a poor rabbi...
...what demons are?
Don't you know?
Maybe the trouble is not demons
but the absence of angels
Mother Joan's angel has gone
and now she's alone with herself
Maybe it's only human nature
Stop this mockery, Jew
You sit over your books
by candlelight...
...and you don't care
that people suffer
That women...
Do women suffer?
Let them. That's their fate
No one can escape his fate
What do you know of demons?
Sit down, priest
Say, what's an evil spirit,
where does he abide?
What is he,
where does he come from?
Who made him? Adonai?
God. Who else could have made him?
What if Satan created the world?
Enough!
For if the Lord created it...
...why is there so much evil in it?
Death and sickness and wars
Why are we Jews being persecuted?
Why are our sons being slaughtered?
Our daughters raped?
- Original sin
- Original sin
The fall of the first parents?
How many times did man fall and rise?
How many times has patient Abel
been killed by Cain?
All the evil man commits...
...is no measure of the evil
that torments him
The fall of the first man,
the fall of the first angel
Why did angels come down
from heaven...
...to beget giants on earthly women?
Tell me why, Father?
Angels...
...are mysterious beings
Your Mother Joan
calls herself 'of the Angels'
But what does she know of angels?
What are angels, Priest?
God sends them
And who sends the devil?
Unless God wills it,
Satan cannot possess a man's soul
When can he possess it?
When man loves him very much
Can man love Satan?
Love is at the root
of everything on Earth
We had a young squire here
who loved a Jewish girl so much...
...that when he died
he took possession of her soul
She was brought here
and stood where you stand
And I called on this spirit
to leave her
Did he?
He would not be driven out
You see!
He said to me he would not leave her
He took her soul
And she died
Love is as strong as death
I shall learn nothing from you
You'd like to learn everything at once
What my great grandfather taught...
...and his great grandfather
All that was written in the scrolls,
in the Zohar and the Temureh
You want me to give it to you
in three words
Just like some business receipt
One, two, three, then done?
You want to hear about all demons
created by eternal Adonai?
And those born of countless angels
and earthly women?
Those that have risen in you...
...to obscure your reason...
...and to take away your wisdom
And those that are now in your heart
You want to know all about demons?
Let them enter your soul
My demons are my business
and my soul is my own
You are me and I am you
Oh, God. What are you saying?
You know nothing, Priest.
You walk in darkness
Your ignorance is like
the black cloak of night
I can teach you nothing.
My teachings are not your teachings
You are me
Be gone!
Be gone
I too know nothing. Nothing at all
Sister, tell Mother Superior
to come to the attic
- To the attic?
- Tell her there will be no exorcisms
Thou whom I have taken
from the ends of the earth...
...and called thee
from the chief men thereof
I have chosen thee
and not cast thee away
Fear thou not for I am with thee
- Why have you called me?
- I desire your salvation
Where is salvation?
It's so difficult for me
to speak my heart
Speak, I'll take it upon myself
I shall absorb your sins
The most terrible thing
is that I like Satan
It gives me joy being possessed
I'm proud this fate has befallen me
That the demons torment me
more than the others
You commit the sin of pride again.
Pray for your humility
- I am lost
- I too thought I was lost
But now I don't believe it.
I am strong, powerful
Mother Joan, I shall lead you
Where to?
What way are you showing me?
You only want me to be calm,
colourless, small
To be just like any ordinary nun
All right. Listen
I myself open my soul to the demons
But you want me to be
like the thousands...
...who have no aim on earth
You want to see me at prayer
all day long
To see me eating beans every day
Do you promise me salvation for this?
I do not want such salvation
If one can't be a saint,
it's better to be damned
Oh, if only you could make me a saint.
I want nothing else
Do you know what it means
to understand everything?
It means to be one with light eternal
and yet remain on Earth
To stand on altars
with candles and incense
To return in prayer to all lips
Oh, that is life
That is life eternal
If not...
If not...
I'd rather be with the devils
Joan, calm yourself
Calm yourself
All redemption is in love
Love is as strong as death
Make a saint of me
That I cannot do
- Don't crush the grain
- I'm scaring off the wolves
Wolves, right
Why is the child crying?
She's wet herself, Father
Take her to the kitchen
or she'll catch a cold
And you wanted to scare off the wolves
Good
Well, yes
I think I'm being tempted
to this sweet beer...
...by some lesser demon
For if evil exists,
it can be great and small
The great devil is called Behemoth
And the small one, Beer, perhaps
Yes
Go home, Father Joseph. Go at once
The journey will calm you
You'll go back to your cell,
see your books...
...and the demons may leave
your body and soul
No, no!
I don't want them to.
Let him stay in me
He is me and I am him
The devil who possessed
her soul and body
Bells
For those who are lost
You can hear them far away
I like these bells
They ring every day
It's terrible in the forest, isn't it?
The wolves howl
The Evil One is at work
So?
She has changed already
Remember, we leave before dawn
Hold it
Hold it
Stop
Oh, my dear, dear mother
I would take the veil, please
Rather than a husband
who would be a brute, please
Rather than a lover
with a stick to beat me
Rather than a thrashing
I would take the veil, please
I would rather sing much
with the nuns in the convent
Than take me a husband
and much trouble with it
Why have you stopped singing?
Go on dancing and enjoying
yourselves. God will forgive you
For you know not what you do
Man is a queer fish
What will become
of your Mother Joan?
She'll stay a nun
And the devil?
The devil will always find work
The devils left Mother Joan
and possessed Father Joseph
Sister Margaret too it seems
Has the squire come for her?
He's possessed too. She's so ugly
I like her
She's big
What about your dad?
Drinking and beating
- Do you pray for him?
- No
Pray with me
Say, God guard my father
I don't mind if I do
- God, guard my father
- And everybody
And everybody
Now go to sleep
Good night
Good night
You've come so soon
So soon
Go away!
Don't torment me
Stay!
I know that if you leave me
you'll go back to Mother Joan
Don't go!
Let her be free. Let her be a saint
Take me
And don't ever go back to Mother Joan
Don't ever leave me!
What must I do?
No! Don't order me to do that
Stay!
Yes, I remember where the axe is
I remember
The stable smells of blood, Squire
Don't talk nonsense
- The horses sense something
- Mount!
- And the lady?
- Come on!
The squire's gone
The squire has deserted me
It's all your fault.
You talked me into sin
Sister Margaret!
The squire has deserted me
You, son of the devil, to hell with you
Kaziuk!
The grooms have been killed
Kaziuk and the others
have been murdered
Killed
I'll call the priest. Father Joseph
Father Joseph!
They were innocent
They went to heaven
Father Joseph
Oh, God.
Now I'm in Satan's power for ever
Father Joseph,
the squire has deserted me
- Go back
- No
I won't go back to the convent
I can't
I do not want to
Go and tell Joan I did it for her
For her good. To save her
To keep the devils in me.
They wanted to go back to her
Tell her. Don't forget
Tell her
I did it out of love
