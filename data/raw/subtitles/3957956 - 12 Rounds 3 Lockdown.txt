Nice place you got here.
Burke?
Relax.
I'm going to level with you.
Hell of a day I've had.
Thirsty work.
Yeah, drinks, of course.
Oh, no. No. Just water.
On duty.
It seems like you've been
holding out on me.
My bad.
Why are you here, Burke?
Now, see that...
Straight to the point.
Cut through all the crap.
This man is smart enough
to know that this
is not a social visit.
This
is business.
We've an arrangement, Burke.
That's proved beneficial
to us both.
Yes. We did
have an arrangement.
I'm afraid I'm not following.
You know, for a smart guy,
George, you're pretty stupid.
Do you know what this means?
It means I make my own rules.
Now I want you
to think about that
when I ask you
my next question.
Where are the files?
Files?
What are you talking about?
How useful are those files
going to be
if you're dead?
And answer the question.
I don't know anything
about any files.
Ah!
Still foggy?
Whoa! Wait, wait, wait!
Wait.
The laptop.
In the safe.
Where?
In the study,
6-21-44.
I wasn't going to do
anything with it.
And the back-ups?
There are none.
Search the place.
Your gun.
Where is it?
The top drawer.
Next to the stove.
You just shot at
a police officer.
Well, it's going to be another
hot one out there, folks,
with a high of 92.
Whoo. Get you sunscreen on.
In local news,
a drug bust last night
carried out by
Detective Tyler Burke
claimed the life of
George Freemont,
a man with alleged links
to organized crime.
This was the conclusion
to an ongoing investigation
headed up by Detective Burke
that was part of
a major crackdown
on the distribution of
illegal narcotics in the area.
In a press conference,
Police Chief Keppler
praised his department
for their swift action.
Hey, Shaw. Hold up.
Just the person
I wanted to see.
What'd I miss?
A pile of paperwork.
This big. Of course.
Now I'm regretting Dr. Gardener
ending my sessions.
Well, it's good
having you back.
Yeah?
Pity no one else
feels the same.
Nobody is blaming you
for what happened.
Look. I don't want you to feel
like you're rushing back.
You're a good cop,
but you took a bullet.
You need more time,
you take it.
There's rushing back,
and there's standing still.
I've done that for too long.
If you need anything,
my office, third floor.
It's practically where I live
these days.
Yeah.
Hey.
I think this belongs to you.
Thanks.
Officer Jenny Taylor,
just out of the academy.
Shaw.
Yeah you used to be
Burke's partner, right?
Yeah, a long time ago.
Back before he got
a cop killed, that is.
How was your vacation anyway?
The psychiatrist's couch gets
a little uncomfortable.
Yeah. I bet.
Well, maybe try not to get
anyone killed this time.
All right. All right.
All right.
Calm down. Calm down.
I just did what any of you
would've done.
Well, almost any of you.
I'm just glad scum like
George Freemont
is off the streets.
Makes the city safer
for all of us.
Unload your firearms.
Statistically,
most shootings take
place under 12 feet.
I'm sure you'll manage to hit
the target at that distance.
I'll bear that in mind.
Jesus, John!
No wonder you can't
hit anything.
What's wrong with the Sig?
Forty caliber. Hmm.
Takes 12 rounds, right?
That's right.
A cop's choice in gun
says a lot about the cop.
Give it a try.
I'm good.
You have no idea
what you can do.
A .45 Kimber.
For the shooter who wants
every round to count.
As far from department issue
as you can get.
I heard it came in real handy
in the Freemont shooting
last night.
You never did like
the way I do things.
There's a right way
and a wrong way.
Let's face it. You were...
Never necessarily afraid
to break a few rules.
Whatever it takes.
Sorry to hear about the rookie.
Nice guy, from what I'd heard.
Ray?
Yeah, he was.
At least it was quick.
Head shot, right?
Good to hear they cleared you.
Yeah.
Kick ass on your
first day back.
What is that?
About 20 bucks from Best Buy.
It's a flash drive disguised
as a credit card.
Hmm.
Bag it and tag it.
Might be something on it.
We need to get it
to the precinct
and logged into evidence.
Anyone for coffee?
Okay.
Hey. Hey.
What you got there?
Oh, just came up from county
morgue from Burke's bust.
Easy to miss, I guess.
Looks like a real
credit card, right?
Flash drive?
Yeah.
Anyway, I got to get it
in to evidence.
See ya.
I'm just signing this in. Ah.
There you go.
Um...
Did you contact
Detective Burke on this?
No. He's out.
Yeah. Well, you might want to
give him a heads up.
Okay. Okay.
Good.
Never necessarily afraid
to break a few rules.
Whatever it takes.
What?
I thought you should know
that a piece of evidence
concerning the
George Freemont case
has arrived at the precinct.
What evidence?
I need to sign out some evidence
that was brought down here.
Mmm. Well, you know the drill.
I do.
Harris, round up the boys
and meet me at the precinct.
Here you go.
Thanks.
What's up?
Evidence concerning
George Freemont.
They're on their way.
I thought we dealt with them.
Not well enough.
What's going on?
Go to the evidence lock-up.
Get whatever was brought in.
All right.
George.
This is my operation now.
Your operation?
Precisely.
I supply the narcotics...
You move them.
I take the profits
and you get whatever cut
I deem you're worth.
Taylor, you know where
Captain Matthews is?
She was in her office
20 minutes ago.
Going our way?
Coffee run.
Machine's out in the bullpen.
'Cause all you desk jockeys do
is drink it all day.
Thought you boys
left for the day.
Something came up.
After you.
Hi. We need the evidence dropped
off from the Freemont case.
It's popular tonight.
Say again?
Yeah, well...
Detective Shaw just
picked it up 10 minutes ago.
You know, these things
are dangerous.
Especially where
my wife is concerned.
Thanks.
Have a good one.
What is it?
A flash drive that
looks like a credit card.
Shaw already signed it out.
- Damn it!
- What?
Shaw's got the evidence.
That credit card?
It's a damn flash drive.
Find him.
I'm in the security hub.
Got him. Third floor.
Son of a... Shit.
He gets out of here with
that card, it's over for us.
Yeah? Meeks.
Take Saul and Gideon
and man the exits.
Make sure Shaw doesn't leave
with everyone else.
Why would everyone be leaving?
Let's go.
Fire alarm.
Please evacuate the building.
Fire alarm.
Please evacuate the building.
Fire alarm.
Please evacuate the building.
He's on the second floor.
Twelve rounds.
It's Darrow. We're in.
Darrow.
I need you to put
the building into lockdown
once everyone leaves.
Everything's run from
the security hub.
I'd need to get in there.
Then why are you still
talking to me?
Get on it.
This is Matthews.
Matthews, it's Shaw.
Is everything all right?
No, I'm in trouble.
Where are you?
I'm at the precinct.
Shaw, what's going on?
Shaw?
What the...
Gee. Great.
Metro Central Station.
This is fire dispatch.
We've got a report
of a third floor alarm.
Can you confirm that, please?
Uh, we copy here at car 15.
Yes, there was a third
floor alarm pulled...
What the hell are you
still doing here?
Making sure everybody's out.
Fire alarm!
Get out!
Ah.
All right, Burke.
I'm starting to lock it down.
All right. Cut the phone lines.
And jam any cell phone signals
in the building.  Copy that.
No problem.
System lockdown initiated.
Communications terminated.
All right. We're dark.
Hi, it's Officer Smith
down here at Metro South.
I just wanted to
let you know that
everything down here is A-okay.
Yeah, you can call off
the fire truck.
We're showing
a fire on level three.
Yeah, that thing's been
acting up all day.
New building.
You know how it is.
Roger that, Metro South.
Have a safe night.
You've got to be kidding me.
Shaw?
Drop it.
Shit.
Let him go.
Lower the gun.
Yeah, I'd rather not.
I'm a lot of things.
But I'm not a cop killer.
You're a lot of things,
all right.
I know all about it, Burke.
All these years I knew
something was up with you.
And they call me crazy?
You always had to do things
the hard way.
I'm going to give you this one
chance for old times' sake,
to just lay down the drive
and walk away.
Burke, will you just
shoot this asshole?
Shut up, Meeks.
What do you say, Shaw?
Press the button.
Don't be stupid.
I'm taking you down, Burke.
I don't think so.
See, I've got an army
of loyal cops.
And last I checked,
your aim wasn't too hot.
Whereas mine...
I don't miss.
Ah!
Shit.
Stay with me, Meeks.
Stay with me.
What happened?
Shaw shot Meeks.
Give me your radio.
Darrow, shut down the elevators now.
Got it.
Let's go.
Okay, elevator is...
Locked down.
Shit.
Confirm lockdown.
Copy that.
All right, Darrow.
Turn it back on.  Copy that.
Meeks.
All right. Let's split up.
Damn it.
Don't move.
Don't even think about it.
You know you're not
going to get away with this.
So be smart.
Oh, I'm smart. You're the one
with a gun to his head.
Hand it over.
Oh, your flash drive?
No, I can't do that.
Really? Well, I guess
I'll just put a bullet
in your head then.
You never did have
what it takes, did you, Shaw?
To be what exactly?
Be one of us.
A corrupt cop?
No.
Oh, I'm going to enjoy
kicking your ass.
All that time off.
It's made you soft.
He's on the first floor.
Copy that.
Somebody get down there. Now.
I don't see him.
Stand by.
Got to be here somewhere.
Okay. I lost him.
Shaw?
Shaw? You're stuck in here too?
I can't get out. I don't know
what the hell's going on.
You shouldn't be in here.
What happened to you?
Are you bleeding?
It's not my blood.
Whose is it?
Officer Meeks.
Is he okay? What happened?
He's dead.
Not by me.
Listen I haven't got time
to explain. All right?
Well, then put your gun down
and we'll play this
by the book.
I can't.
Listen to me.
You're not looking
very innocent right now, Shaw.
Don't do that.
Take your hands off the gun.
Put 'em behind your head
and turn around.
Taser?
Are you kidding me?
Listen to me.
Find a quiet corner,
put your head down and hide
until we're out of lockdown.
You understand me?
Wait, where are you going?
I think the motor pool
is on a separate grid
from the rest of the building.
There might be a way out.
Well, then let me
come with you.
No.
Trust me. Just do what
I told you. Okay?
What the hell is going on here?
Anything?
Not yet.
Detective Burke, if you're still in
the building, pick up on channel one.
Burke. Talk to me.
Go ahead.
What the hell is going on?
I've been told we got
a fire in there.
No fire. I had to
evacuate the building.
Shaw's lost it, and I've got
a dead cop as a result.
I had to contain the situation.
This was the only way.
Oh, my God.
Find him and keep me updated.
I'll handle things out here.
Where is this son of a...
Security breach.
Parking door access.
He's in the motor pool.
Hey! Where the hell
are you going?
To kill Shaw.
You go where I tell you to go.
Go to the exit and man it,
in case he gets past us.
Yeah? And who put
you in charge?
Don't test me, Saul.
Hey. Play nice, boys.
Go! Go!
Where is he? Where is he?
Here. There, there, there!
Ah!
Fucker.
Ah!
Oh, son of a bitch.
This guy is starting to
piss me off!
Detective Burke.
What are you still doing here?
I got locked in.
Sir, I saw Shaw...
And he wasn't making any sense.
He was telling me
to hide, but...
What's going on?
Walk with me.
Perfect.
Nine rounds left.
Patch me into the PA system.
Take a seat, please.
Shaw.
I've got a friend
of yours here.
Say hello.
Detective Shaw.
It's Officer Taylor.
How old are you,
Officer Taylor?
I'm 23, sir.
And how long have you
been with us?
A month, sir.
Tell me...
Are you married?
Yes, I am.
And what's the name
of the lucky man?
Brett. Brett.
Hear that, Shaw?
Now, if I don't see you
on one of these monitors
in the next five seconds...
Brett is going to be a widower.
Now, I know you don't
want another dead rookie cop
on your conscience,
now, do you?
What are you doing?
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
He's on the first floor.
Find him. Kill him.
Copy that. On my way.
Good job, Officer.
I'll see you get a medal.
I do hate being a bad guy.
Damn it!
Shaw has proven
to be resourceful.
From here on out, we will not
underestimate him, and we will not stop
until he is dead and
the evidence is destroyed.
Unless you boys and girl
care to spend the rest of your
life bent over behind bars.
Let's waste this asshole.
Darrow, where the hell is he?
I'm working on it.
Bingo. He's in the crime lab.
Of course.
We just lost eyes in the room.
Ah!
Ah!
Tony!
You're looking at that door, wondering
if that's your escape route.
It's one of two options
I'm considering.
And the other option?
Putting a bullet in your head.
Unless you just want to turn in
your gun and badge right now.
Yeah, well, that's just not
much of an option, now, is it?
He's in the vents!
Let's move.
For the time being, we are operating
under a full media blackout.
I've spoken to Detective
Burke and he assures me
that he is trying to end this
as peacefully as possible.
Chief. Who's running
this circus?
I am, sir.
Not anymore.
Would you mind telling me
what in the hell is going on?
Detective John Shaw.
He's had a few problems.
Meaning?
Shaw was shot in the line of
duty seven months ago,
along with his rookie partner,
Ray Jones, who lost his life.
A lot of cops around here
blamed him for his death.
They still do.
Shaw was suffering from
post-traumatic stress
and assigned a
station psychiatrist.
Made excellent progress.
Enough that, last week, he was
signed off and given the all-clear.
Looks like his assessment
was inaccurate.
Well, that's the understatement
of the goddamn century, Matthews.
What's the situation inside?
We're in complete lockdown.
All phone signals are blocked.
We're communicating with Detective
Burke via walkie-talkie.
Well, at least that's one
piece of good news.
I want to talk to Burke.
Shaw's lost it, sir.
He gunned down Meeks
in cold blood.
We gave him the opportunity
to surrender, but
it doesn't look like something
he's willing to do.
He's since killed another
three cops and a rookie,
Officer Taylor.
I've got a SWAT team in-bound.
If you don't stop
this, they will.
Copy.
Piece of shit.
So, what's the deal
with Burke and Shaw?
How do you mean?
Well, there's history
there, right?
Yeah. They used to be partners.
Came through the
academy together.
There was a time when
they were inseparable.
Doesn't seem to be a lot
of love there anymore.
No. They see the world a
little differently these days.
See, Burke wants
what's due to him.
Bigger car, better house.
Not some lousy pension
and a gold watch.
That's me and that's
you, but that's not Shaw.
He's... A guy who wants to
make the world a better place?
I was gonna say a dick.
But, whatever.
Here we go.
Burke, come in.
Go ahead.
I've lost CCTV.
What?  Shaw's gotta be
in the server room.
I'm on my way.
- Security alert.
- Data override engaged.
That son of a bitch is trying
to send the evidence to IA.
How?
I don't know. He must've
manually overridden
the network from
the server room.
Shut it down!
Yeah. I'm trying.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Do it!
Okay, we're good.
He's gone.
It's useless.
Burke, he's on the roof.
He could make a
call from up there!
Come on, you piece of crap.
Yes!
If we don't have eyes
in the building,
we gotta figure out
a way to do it.
So what's this? Is this
a conduit here?
Roger that.
Roger that, sir.
John, is that you?
Yeah, it's me. Where are you?
I'm on the roof.
They jammed the cell phone
signals in the building.
Listen, I'm innocent.
John... You gotta believe me.
I've heard that you shot and
killed five cops in cold blood.
You know me.
You really believe that?
No, I don't.
But you need to tell me
what is happening in there.
It's Burke. He's dirty, and
I've got the evidence.
Wait. What are you
talking about?
Burke and his men were working
with George Freemont.
Selling him drugs from busts
in return for a
cut of the profits.
Did you get him?
I'm working on it.
I'm heading your way.
Get it done!
Oh, shit!
Eight rounds.
Six bad guys.
Love those odds.
Gideon?
Porter?
Freeze!
Drop the weapon.
Nice and slow.
Nice and slow.
And the pistol.
Kick it over here.
Call off your men.
Turn off that radio.
Shaw's not on the roof.
Okay. Copy that.
You gonna kill me?
Nope.
I'm getting out of here
and you're my
ticket. Turn around.
You're not getting out of here.
You couldn't save
Officer Taylor,
you couldn't save Ray Jones, and you
sure as hell can't save yourself.
I wonder
if your men will save you.
If they'll let you die,
like you let Meeks die.
You've killed more
cops than me tonight.
And why?
Because you think you're
doing the right thing.
You put your life on the line,
and what did it get you?
A cop killed, an ugly scar
and a permanent
date with a shrink.
Not another word.
It didn't have to be this way, Shaw.
Quiet.
We all put our lives on the
line each and every day.
So what if we take a
little something back?
Take a look at
your badge, Burke.
Protect and serve.
That's the difference
between you and me.
You serve the badge,
when the badge
should serve you.
Get the elevator working.
Be convincing.
Darrow.
Copy.
You have the elevator working.
Coming down.
Okay. Got you.
Remember our first
day as partners?
Remember how I told you,
"Never cuff a man's
hands behind his back,"
"'cause you can't see what
he's doing back there"?
Shaw?
I've got some advice
for you, Shaw.
Try hitting some place that
isn't covered by Kevlar.
Like your head?
Burke, talk to me.
Go ahead.  You've got
five minutes to get out.
All you've succeeded in
doing is pissing Shaw off.
We've got five minutes to
kill this son of a bitch.
Let's go.
Great.
Drop the gun.
You're not gonna shoot me.
Shit!
Gotcha!
Burke, come in.
Burke, answer me.
I've got this under control, sir.
Time's up.
We're cutting the power.
SWAT are coming in.
Darrow, SWAT's
cutting the power.
No, no, no, no, no. Burke,
if they do that,
we're out of lockdown and
Shaw can make calls!
Tell me something I don't know.
Power up the elevators.
You got it.
Hello, Shaw.
Offer you a ride to the lobby?
What?
Don't move. Stay where you are.
You think you can get
a shot off before me?
Yeah.
At least one of you
would go down with me.
Are you crazy?
You're alive, aren't you?
All you had to do
was lay it down and walk away.
Now look at you.
Hand me the flash drive.
I can't do that.
Then I'm afraid
you're of no use to me.
I know you still
have it on you.
You are nothing
if not predictable.
I'm willing to bet it's
in your back left pocket.
Now, hand it over.
Or I'll shoot you in the
head and take it anyway.
You know my favorite
part of training?
It's combat exercises.
You call that a punch?
That was just my good cop.
Wait till you see my bad cop.
This is what you get
for fucking with me!
You're gonna die,
just like Ray Jones did.
You never should have
come back, Shaw.
You never had what it
took for the job
even before you lost it.
Hand me his gun.
Okay, SWAT's in position.
Prepare to kill the power.
Any last words?
Yeah.
Is "asshole" one word or two?
'Cause I don't want to spell it
wrong on your Christmas card.
That is a funny man!
I'm gonna savor the moment
when your head pops.
Saved two rounds for yourself?
Actually, I saved one for him,
and I saved the last for you.
Power's cut, move in.
Move, move, move!
Watch the right!
Clear!
Flank at right.
Last round.
Floor one clear. Moving up!
Shit!
Contact! Visual!
Move, move, move, move, move!
On your six!
Moving left!
Move, gentlemen! Eyes open!
Matthews?
They cut the power.
Signal jammer's down.
Listen, I haven't got long.
Burke destroyed the evidence.
I'm out of options.
All right? You gotta
call the SWAT off.
I can't. It's Keppler's call.
You're my only option.
All right? Or all this
has been for nothing.
Okay. Can you meet me at the rear
of the building in the drill hall?
I'll try.
Not good enough, Shaw.
Yeah, I can make it.
Be there in 10 minutes.
Right.
This floor is clear.
Got you covered.
Oh, thank God. You made it.
Just about. I've got a car
waiting out back. Come on.
Lose the gun.
Matthews?
I said, lose the gun.
Burke?
You're working with Burke?
Come on.
Who do you think cleans up
messes like tonight, huh?
The only good thing
about tonight
is that you presented me
with the ideal opportunity
to cut Matthews out
of our operation.
Don't even think about it.
I was never the type to
share my toys as a kid.
I told you I'd never let
you walk out of here.
This is my show.
It's taken a long time to
build what I've built.
And neither you or George
Freemont or anyone else
will stand in my way.
Enjoy retirement.
Hands where we can see 'em!
Hands up! Move, move, move!
Detective Burke!
This son of a bitch just
shot Captain Matthews.
All right, we've got him.
It's over.
Arrest this piece of shit.
Wait!
Wait.
I told you I'd never let
you walk out of here.
This is my show.
It's taken a long time to
build what I've built.
And neither you or George
Freemont or anyone else
will stand in my way.
Enjoy retirement.
I'm out.
Ah!
Looks like I kicked ass on
my first day back after all.
