On behalf of your commanding officer...
...I can tell Mr. Jos√© lturbi that this ship's
officers and crew...
...are grateful to him for coming here
to lead our Navy bands.
Along with every other civilian,
it is I who am grateful to you.
And to all the men in the US Navy.
The men who are to be decorated
are present, sir.
"Joseph Brady, Gunner's Mate,
Second Class.
"Clarence Doolittle, Seaman, First Class.
"During the action aboard
the USS Cruiser Knoxville...
"...these men served their gun
until the ammunition was exhausted.
"When by force of explosion,
Doolittle was blown overboard...
"...Joseph Brady, without regard
for his own personal safety...
"...dived into the sea
and rescued his shipmate."
Acting for the Secretary of the Navy,
I award you both the Silver Star.
- Congratulations, Brady.
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations, Doolittle.
- Thank you, sir.
To those formerly on the Knoxville,
including those just decorated:
You'll have four days leave
effective immediately.
Leave your quarters!
The poor little fellows! They gotta stay
and mind the ship for the Admiral.
They can't go to Hollywood
where beautiful dames grow like oranges.
Where all you got to do is reach out
and pick them, right off the street.
- Congratulations, Joe.
- Thanks.
If you visit the studios and see any stars,
will you get me their autographs?
Oh, no. After eight months at sea,
it won't be autographs I'll wind up with.
- I got plans.
- What kind of plans?
In Hollywood,
I've got a little plan named... Lola.
That Lola, I tell you she's a...
It isn't exactly that. It's a...
No, it isn't that either.
Tell us about it, Joe.
You noticed how different
the band sounded with lturbi leading it?
Lola is like that.
In a room with a million beautiful dames,
she'd be the one you'd see.
You mean, she's different?
I wouldn't say that. If you like dames,
why get one that's different?
No. It's just that whatever
the others have, Lola has more of it.
You think she is still waiting?
Dames have been known to wander.
From me? Please, Sailor,
leave us not talk mutiny!
Fall in on deck for special leave!
Do you think we can tear ourselves away?
Yeah, but it'll be tough.
"We hate to leave
"We hate to leave
"But when they give you leave
You gotta leave!
"Our hearts bleed
for all of you guys aboard
"But right now sympathy's
a thing we can't afford!
"We hate to leave
"Without you guys along
We'll grieve and grieve
"But we'll be back
"Yes, we'll be back
before we're even missed
"And tell you guys about
the countless dames that we have kissed
"Believe us, Mate
"We really hate to leave! "
It's awful for us to leave
these guys here in their undershirts.
But we gotta go meet those dames
in their soft silk dresses.
Duty is duty! An order is an order!
I know some guys would love meeting
a gorgeous gal every night.
"We hate to leave
"When they give you leave
You gotta leave
"No more pinup gals that we so enjoy
"Tonight they're forcing us
to meet the real McCoy
"We hate to leave
"But we'll be back before
the anchors heave
"We wanna stay, we wanna stay
Our hearts are with the ship
"The Admiral made us take this leave
He beat us with a whip
"Believe us, Mate
"We really...
"...hate to leave! "
But, honey, I saved all of my leave for you!
Why shouldn't I have?
You're the only one anyplace I want to see.
What is he doing wrong?
He's dead, that's all. Watch.
I don't want to meet
your boyfriend's ex-girlfriend.
I want to meet you.
Well, you'll be sorry!
"You'll be sorry! "
Hello? Miss LaVerne?
Miss Lola LaVerne?
Is this the face that launched
a thousand ships?
Yeah, it's Joe, alright.
Doesn't anybody want coffee?
Well, it'll take me awhile to hit Hollywood.
Can you wait?
I know what you mean, baby.
But you just try.
Well, let's decide that later.
After eight months at sea, all I want to do
is just look at you for a long, long time.
C'mon! Eight months is
a long enough time to wait!
Hello, you beautiful creature.
When you hear the tone,
the time will be 6:10 and one quarter.
Buy War Bonds!
Thank you, I will.
Hey, the buses for Hollywood!
"Anchors Aweigh! "
What's the matter?
Nothing. Why?
Where are you going so late?
To join the Navy.
What?
I said I'm going to join the Navy.
- Wait a minute!
- I'm in a hurry.
Take it easy. Where do you live?
- Why?
- I want to take you home.
I'm not going home.
I've just come from there.
What's your name?
Look, it's my job to help lost boys.
"Lost" means not knowing
where you're going. I do know.
I'm going to join the Navy.
If that's what you want,
but you'll come to the station with me.
I want to join the Navy, not the police.
Brooklyn!
Are you following me?
What's with you? Come on, spill it!
Well, you see it's like this, Joe.
I've been in the Navy a year and a half.
Every time we hit port and get liberty,
all I do is go to the library.
So you like books? What's the beef?
Now I want to try something different,
like going out with girls.
- Good luck.
- But I don't know how to begin.
Wait. Don't give me that.
After all, you're no yokel
you're from Brooklyn.
Even in Brooklyn things can go wrong.
What do you mean?
Right from boy's high school, I went
to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine...
...as assistant choirmaster.
And from there I joined the Navy.
I wouldn't tell that to anyone but you.
Sure, I'll keep it quiet.
Look, you want a couple
of phone numbers?
I'd be too scared to use them.
But when you mentioned Lola, I thought...
- Are you kidding?
- It's not what you think!
I thought I could string along and learn.
After all, you're the best wolf in the Navy.
Besides, you gotta help me.
You saved my life
and you owe me something.
I saved your life,
so now I owe you something?
Have you gone crazy?
I didn't ask you to save my life,
but you did.
Now I figure you're responsible for me.
Well, I don't.
What's the sense of having your life saved,
if you can't have any fun with it?
Look, I got a lot to do in four days.
I don't want you tailing me.
You say I owe you something.
Well, I don't see it.
If I find you a dame and get you started,
will you call it quits?
Let me see...
We'll have to do the best
with what you've got.
First, fix your hat.
Let me see a sample of your technique.
You are you, and I'm a dame
coming down the street. Pick me up.
I'm a dame coming down the street.
Come on.
I beg your pardon, Miss...
Lady, could I possibly...
Give it more pep.
When you're hunting
it's how you feel that counts.
If you feel like a mouse
you'll get only cheese.
But if you feel like a wolf,
nothing can go wrong. You're in control.
One of you has to come with me
to the station. Any choice? You'll do.
- Please, let's not have any unpleasantness.
- I'll go with you, Joe.
How can this happen to me
just when I'm beginning to feel like a wolf?
The Secretary of the Navy
and Washington will hear about this!
Who's in charge around here?
Are you the guy who had me pulled in?
- Pardon me for not getting up.
- What's the charge?
If you've been inconvenienced, I'm sorry.
This young man wants to join the Navy.
We want him to go home.
He won't tell us where he lives...
...but he might tell a sailor.
You want to join the Navy, huh?
Aye-aye, sir.
Attention!
- Name?
- Donald Martin, sir.
- Where do you live?
- 1515 Foothill Road.
My daddy was in the Navy and he said
when I was grown up I could join.
And now I am grown up, so I want to.
Sure, Mate, but...
There's a rule in the Navy.
You gotta have a letter from your mother
or father saying it's okay.
But I don't have a mother
or father anymore.
I live with my Aunt Susie.
Would a letter from an aunt be alright?
Sure. Why don't you talk to her about it?
One of these guys will take you home.
You!
Gotta even be a nursemaid...
Aunt Susie may not give me the letter,
but if you asked her...
- You better come, too.
- I can't.
What will I do about Lola?
I guess Aunt Susie must be asleep, huh?
She isn't home yet.
I suppose the door is locked, too.
- But we can get in.
- How?
The way I got out.
Look out for my wagon.
"Dear Miss Abbott:
Donald was a very good boy.
"He is fast asleep, so I went home.
Mrs. Murphy."
I know where my aunt hides the candy.
Wait, will she return soon?
Oh, sure.
"Oh, sure?" How do you know?
Well, she lives here.
Sometimes he talks like you.
I don't want you to think
I'd walk out on you.
But you gotta stay with the kid anyhow...
I got a date with a girl.
That's great! That's dandy!
He's got a date with a girl!
Does he think I have a date with a duck?
Goodbye!
Brooklyn, I'm blowing.
The baby is all yours.
But what about my being a wolf?
You promised me.
You promised me you'd talk to Aunt Susie.
If you don't help me, what will I do?
What will become of me?
Who is he calling?
A girl.
Forgotten you?
Honey, with the picture of you
I've got in my mind?
Why, even across the phone
I can see every...
Look, this is what happened.
I found a kid that was lost...
Joe, I wasn't lost!
I had to take him home. I won't be long.
As long as I get there?
Honey, you know I'll get there.
Look, we better discuss that later, huh?
What are you going to discuss later?
Things. You'll understand
when you get older.
Everybody keeps saying that to me.
They used to say that to me, too.
Well, did you understand
when you got older?
No.
What can an old aunt
be doing out this late?
Susan, don't you wish
that you were up there?
I've never heard his voice
sound so beautiful.
Iturbi gets so much from a singer.
I'd give anything to work with him.
Cut it! Print that.
Okay, children. You can go home now,
and thanks very much.
- How was it for camera?
- Right on the nose.
When will we shoot the boogie-woogie?
Hi, Aunt Susie.
What got you home so early?
Your feet give out?
What?
Dames like you kill me. Don't you ever
think of anybody but yourself?
Leaving a little kid alone
while you're out having a big time.
Would you mind telling me who you are
and why you're here?
Just a guy the police called in when
they found this kid wandering around.
Of course, that wouldn't interest you.
So if you'd just step aside...
Don't apologize, just clear the deck!
Come on, Brooklyn.
Hey, Joe, the kid is crying.
Well, if I had to live with a dame like that,
I'd cry, too.
I thought she was nice.
A dame who leaves a kid alone ain't nice.
Wait, please. Give me a chance.
Donald explained...
Okay. You're very sorry.
But we have plans,
and we want to get going.
Oh, I haven't any plans.
I thought if you didn't mind
you could come back for a while.
Donald is so upset.
It's way past his bedtime.
Sure. We didn't even say goodbye.
Something wrong, Joe?
I thought you'd gone!
- Hey, Sailor, what's with you?
- You forgot about me...
...about what you promised!
You know, the letter!
Well, he wanted to join the Navy.
But I told him about the rule.
The rule about needing a letter
from your folks saying it's okay.
And Donald wanted Joe to ask you for it.
Suppose we talk about that
in the morning?
If you give it to me now,
I can go right with Joe.
You want me to go with you, don't you?
Well, sure, kid.
But you need other things
besides the letter.
Can you read and write?
No, he can't. He plays hooky all the time.
You can't? Do you think
the Navy takes dopes?
Not ever?
Sometimes, but even the dopes
have to be able to read and write.
No, I'm sorry, kid, it's just no soap.
Joe, now what will I do?
Well, first you gotta go to school
and study real hard.
Before you know it, you won't be a dope.
Now, how about going to bed?
I want Joe to put me to bed.
Donald, we can't keep these gentlemen.
They have things to do.
No, they haven't. They're on leave.
We'd be very happy to put him to bed,
wouldn't we, Joe?
Thank you,
but you've done enough already.
Okay, but no stalling!
Come on, you helper, you!
Hit the sack, Sailor.
Joe! You're coming back to see me.
Promise?
Sure. That's a deal.
All set?
No, I always get sung to sleep.
Look who wants to join the Navy!
Hey, do you think
they sing us sailors to sleep?
But I'm not in the Navy yet,
so it's alright for me to be sung to.
Where he's right, he's right.
You sing to him. After all,
you're the choirmaster around here.
I told you that
in the strictest of confidence.
You promised never to bring it up.
"Lullaby
"And good night
"With roses bedight
"Bright angels around
"My darling shall stand!
"Lay thee down now and rest
"May thy slumber be blessed"
- They're asleep.
- Your friend, too?
Well, I made some coffee.
You shouldn't have.
I mean, it's swell, but...
It's nothing.
Is something wrong?
Did you have a nice nap?
- But I have coffee and sandwiches.
- Sorry, we gotta blow.
I have to tell you something,
and you won't like it.
Remember you were going
to get me a girl?
I've seen the one I want.
But you promised me.
Okay, I promised you!
But I didn't promise you Aunt Susie!
Good night.
But, Lola, it's not that late!
Baby, I know you're tired, but...
What do you mean, it's for my sake?
Well, honey, I wouldn't
be disappointed in you.
I couldn't be.
No, no, no, I'm not sore.
I'll be by tomorrow.
12:00? In the morning?
Well, alright, if that's what you want.
That's tough.
Hurry up.
- What's the Navy coming to?
- I ask myself that.
I don't want to keep
messing up your plans.
We won't have to look for a girl for me.
We've already found Aunt Susan.
Listen, I didn't save your life
for that character!
I'll get you a dame that's a dame.
Right now we got to find a place to sleep,
so relax.
Shut up!
A couple of empties down there, fellas.
First night's leave?
Do you want to talk?
We ran into trouble with some kid.
And what a kid!
What another kid she had waiting for us
when we got home.
Such trouble we should run into
every night of our life, huh?
Oh, boy, what a town this is!
How do you like that? I walk my feet off
all night and end up with a glass of beer.
You don't live right.
Never in all my life
have I seen such dames!
This blonde... Not that there was anything
wrong with your redhead...
She was rather interesting.
"Interesting! "
You should have seen the kid work.
I'll tell you, we took the dames home.
A little slow at first...
I asked my girl for a kiss.
She said, "No."
We want the details. What happened?
I'll tell you.
"I begged her"
That's the way he started.
"I pleaded"
You should have seen him.
"I told her, 'Baby,
come out of your shell'
"I told her, 'Maybe,
you'll find that it's swell"'
What technique!
"I argued! "
I never saw such a stubborn dame!
"I threatened! "
And he's got muscles, too.
"I said, 'You can't send me home
Not like this'
"And I finally got that kiss"
Tell them, Brooklyn.
"She begged me"
True.
"She pleaded"
Got down on bended knee!
"She told me, 'Baby,
come out of your shell"'
He was sensational!
"She told me, 'Maybe,
you'll find that it's swell"'
Tell them, Brooklyn.
"She argued"
Fought like a wildcat.
"She threatened"
Practically drew a gun on the boy.
"She said, 'You can't send me home
Not like this."'
What happened?
"She finally got her kiss! "
What a time we had tonight.
What a dish! What a dream!
What a dame!
And she lives alone!
What time is it?
It's early.
What time is it?
What happened to that clock?
The phone! Where is it?
Hello? Hello, Lola, honey...
Then who is it?
Well, this is Joe Brady. Where is Lola?
Did she leave a message for me?
Never mind what you'd say!
What did Lola say?
Well, that's too bad about you, too!
Hey, don't hang up on me!
Leave a note. Tell her I'll call later!
Honest, Joe, I can explain everything!
You were sleeping like a baby!
I know you needed a rest badly!
Help!
It's against the rules, but we thought
we'd serve you breakfast up here.
After all, you've been through so much.
You must appreciate a buddy like Clarence.
Do you know he wouldn't let anyone
make a sound all morning?
We crept around like little mice so as not
to wake you. I never saw such devotion!
Don't think I don't appreciate it.
And don't think I won't pay him back.
- I'm sure Clarence doesn't expect it.
- No, really, I don't. I'd hate it.
You poor boy.
Forty-eight days and nights on a raft!
If you want any more coffee
just let us know.
- He looks so shy.
- He's so sweet.
Joe, you ought to eat this food.
It gets cold very quickly.
Try the eggs, they're very good.
I left you a razor in the shower,
and there's a towel...
You can wait on me hand and foot!
You can polish my shoes and be my slave!
But, Clarence, it won't do you any good.
Because I'm not going to help you
with Aunt Susan!
Joe, it isn't Aunt Susan, it's Donald.
You promised him
you'd go back to see him.
Why, it's like breaking the word of honor
of the whole United States Navy!
I'm not going back to that house!
Look, I get you a date with her,
and I don't owe you a thing, right?
Here, take all this stuff.
You'll make an impression.
Let me look at you.
Well, it will have to do.
Now, try, will you?
Won't you come in?
We promised Donald we'd come back,
and Brooklyn got him all those toys.
That's awfully kind of you.
Let's put them over here.
Where is he hiding?
Donald? He's still in school.
Thanks to you, he went almost willingly.
Say, aren't you a little young
to be bringing up a kid all by yourself?
Well, I'm all the family he has.
His mother died when he was a baby
and then his father.
His father left us this house,
and that helps quite a lot.
I work and that keeps me from
being with Donald as much as I'd like.
I never know when the studio will call me.
Gee, are you an actress?
I want to be a singer. But right now
I'm doing extra work in the movies.
You ever do any singing?
But there are some really great musicians.
There's Stokowski and lturbi
and people like that who work in pictures.
There's the chance I might get to sing
for one of them.
Any luck so far?
That's awful.
That's terrible.
Thank you, Clarence.
I didn't realize it was so late.
Please forgive me, but I really should
run up and dress now.
I'm sorry you missed Donald.
He'll be disappointed.
We didn't come just to see Donald, we...
I'm going to tell her
whether you like it or not.
Clarence didn't sleep all night.
Do you know why?
Because he was thinking about you.
I told him you'd understand...
...how it is getting into a strange town
when you've been away at sea.
"She'll understand how important it is,"
I told him...
Clarence, do you want to take me out?
Is that what all this means?
- She's a girl with a heart...
- Well, I'd love to.
Honest?
I wish I could make it tonight,
but I'm busy.
Boyfriend?
Oh, no, just someone I met at the studio.
He should be here now,
so I have to run up and dress.
But you meant what you said
about calling you?
Of course. Any night you're free, ring me.
Goodbye and thank you again for Donald.
You know, she's not so bad.
Gee, I'm glad you like her.
I didn't say I like her.
I said she wasn't bad.
Yeah, but coming from you...
Well, if Aunt Susie likes him,
he must be okay.
That's a nice car, isn't it?
Hey, aren't you even worried?
Once he takes her out,
she'll laugh at any place that we...
That you could take her to.
This means nothing to me.
I'm telling you for your own good.
Once she goes out with him, you're dead.
- You think so?
- Sure.
There's nothing I can do about it.
Brooklyn, there's always something
you can do about everything. Come on.
Did you want to see Miss Abbott?
She is dressing. I'll call her.
I wouldn't do that.
Susie hates to be bothered
when she's dressing.
Yeah, she hates it.
Something wrong, Jack?
No. Nothing at all.
Then squat someplace, Jack,
you're making me nervous.
My name is Bertram Kraler.
Are you good friends of Miss Abbott?
You might call it that.
Are you?
We just met. I'm taking her to dinner.
Maybe you know what you're doing,
but I don't think the boys will like it.
I beg your pardon? The boys?
The Navy isn't going to like
Susie branching out this way.
Miss Abbott knows
a great many Navy men?
Maybe some she doesn't know.
Say, a dozen or two?
You get aboard a new ship,
you don't know a soul.
You're lonesome.
Then at chow somebody says,
"Anybody seen Susie lately?"
Right away everybody is talking about her.
It's kind of homey, if you see what I mean.
Yes, I do.
But, well, she seemed such a quiet girl.
That's not what the song says.
When they sing about her,
they never mention the word "quiet."
The Navy has a song about her?
I don't believe it.
Alright, let me hear it.
I don't think so, Bertram.
It's strictly for sailors.
- Yeah, it's not your type of a song.
- I insist.
- Alright, if he insists, let's play it.
- I don't think we ought to.
- Play that "Susie" song.
- You start and I'll find you a key.
"If you knew Susie
Like we know Susie
"Oh, what a gal!
"She's not so choosy
No, not our Susie
"Susie is a lollapaloozie
"When Susie kisses
"It never fails
"When Susie kisses
She takes the wind right out of your sails
"So in conclusion
"Beware of Susan
"Oh, what a gal!
"'S' is for sincerity
"Which she's got none of
"'U' is for
"You know what I mean
"'S' is for
"Sincerity
"Which she's got none of
"'I' is for the Irish in her smile
"Her Irish smile
"'E' is for
"Her eagerness to please us
"That is how she won her Navy 'E'!
"Put them all together
"They spell 'Susie'
"The sweetheart of the boys at sea!
"Oh, that Susie
She's a doozie
- "She's not choosy
- You won't loose-y
- "Don't care who's he
- I mean you-sy
"You'll get woozy
After just one date with Susie
"When you take her home about 10:00
"Another garb is waiting there
To take our Susie out again
- "So, in conclusie
- Beware of Susie
- "She belongs to you and you and me
- And the US Navy"
I don't know what's wrong with him,
do you, Brooklyn?
Yes. And I wish I didn't.
Will you tell Miss Abbott, I regret...
Regret what?
What's the matter?
What are you two doing here?
You regret what?
I fear there has been a misunderstanding.
Knowing your tastes, the kind of evening
I planned wouldn't interest you.
What did you say to him?
What's the difference?
I'd like to know what you said to him.
I figured you were stuck with him.
It wasn't Brooklyn, it was me.
Why should you think
I was stuck with him?
I thought you'd be glad to get rid of him.
That you'd be grateful.
You thought I'd be grateful.
Yes.
If I were a dame...
Suppose you were a dame, and for a year
you'd been trying to get someplace?
Finally you met a man whose mother was
in the philharmonic society...
...who could introduce you
to important people like lturbi?
I think it's the meanest and the cruelest...
Don't cry.
Please, don't cry.
Go away.
I'm sorry. I had no right
to brush Bertram off without your okay.
Honest, I'm sorry. Please don't cry.
I know you didn't mean it.
But I might never get another chance.
We've got a better chance for you.
That is, Clarence has.
- It's a surprise.
- Well, what kind of a surprise?
He won't tell you. That's Clarence all over.
Do you know what he did before the Navy?
He was the assistant...
Joe, remember your promise!
I can tell her you were in music, can't I?
He was a big shot, too.
Only today he said, "I wonder
if meeting lturbi would do her any good.
"After all, he's a friend of mine."
He is?
They're pals.
I once even heard lturbi say:
"It is I who should be grateful
to you, Clarence."
Remember, at San Diego?
Do you know what he did?
He called his pal lturbi...
...and arranged for you to have an audition.
Clarence, you didn't!
When? When did he say?
Tell her when.
Saturday. Saturday morning at 11:15.
I'm sorry. It's the nicest thing
that anyone has ever done for me.
What did he say?
What did you tell him about me?
Look, I've got an idea...
Clarence has so many things to tell you,
why don't you have dinner together?
That would be a wonderful idea!
- You come, too.
- Please do.
You haven't got a thing to do
until 10:00, remember?
You came!
You've been in school all this time?
I stayed to tell the teacher
what I had to study for the Navy.
She sure doesn't know much.
You kept the teacher until now?
I am taking you to Mrs. Murphy's.
We're going out.
- I'll come, too.
- No, you won't.
But I gotta talk to Joe.
You can talk to Joe some other time.
- When? Tomorrow?
- Sure.
Will you come to school to see me?
- Aunt Susie is coming tomorrow.
- Okay. It's a promise.
Hey, you dope!
You wanted to be alone with her.
Why drag me along?
Because I don't know what lturbi
said to me on the phone.
It's a wishing well. Every time I pass by,
I always toss a coin in and make a wish.
Thanks to you I got my wish.
Oh, but should I still toss a coin in?
You better play it safe.
Now it's your turn.
No. My theory is:
"Wishing don't make it so."
You decide what you want,
then go out and get it.
Oh, no! Not again! Enchiladas!
What else? Enchiladas for three
and all the trimmings.
Now, listen, gentlemen, this is on me.
- You can't spend your money on us.
- I'm not going to.
- Will you wash the dishes?
- Polish silver?
Scrub the floors?
That sounds reasonable.
Now, you stay right here,
and no matter what happens, be brave.
- You're set, I'm going to blow.
- You can't leave!
How will you ever get to know her?
Besides, I want to phone Lola.
We have Miss Susan Abbott
to sing for you.
"Jealousy!
"You constantly torture me
"I sometimes wonder
"If this spell that I'm under
"Can only be a melody
"For I know no one but me
"Has won your heart
"But when the music starts
"My peace departs
"From the moment they play
"That languorous strain
"And we surrender to all
"lts charm once again
"This jealousy
"That tortures me
"Is ecstasy!
"Mysterious pain
"We danced to a tango of love
"Your heart beats with mine as we sway
"Your eyes give the answer
I'm dreaming of
"That soft word your cruel lips
will never say
"I fear that the music will end
"And shatter the spell in the end
"You make me believe
"When your eyes just deceive
"And it's only the tango you love"
- Where's the phone?
- Right up here.
Gee, I thought you were wonderful.
Joe went to make a phone call.
He's a busy guy.
He is the biggest wolf in the Navy.
They call him the sea wolf.
That's what they call him.
Clarence, do you realize
that I don't know anything about you?
Other than that you're very nice.
Tell me about yourself.
I'm fine.
Well, what sort of work do you do
in the Navy?
Gun crew.
Is it interesting?
Keen.
We missed you.
Susie, it was not bad this time,
it was great.
Juan, I have wonderful news.
Guess for whom I'm going to sing
on Saturday at 11:15? Jos√© lturbi.
The Jos√© lturbi.
Clarence is one of his best friends,
and he arranged it for me.
Wait! I must tell Mama! I must tell Pedro!
I must tell everybody!
It's only an audition.
It'll be all over the street in five minutes.
Susan, should you tell people?
You have a wonderful voice but...
Yeah, what if everything
didn't go just right?
You've given me the opportunity
and I want everyone to know about it.
If I fail, it's right
they should know that, too.
I guess she's right.
Say, Clarence,
why don't you dance with Susan?
Do you want to? I mean,
I'd like to, if you'd like to.
I'd love to.
I only know how to waltz.
That's too bad.
Maybe they'll play one later on.
You know, you two are a strange team.
Clarence is so shy and you're so...
Well, you're a sea wolf,
Clarence told me you were.
Well, dames are crazy about him.
Nice dames, that is.
And not about you? Nice dames, that is?
I'm altogether a different kind of a guy.
I'm never serious about things.
But, Clarence, he's always on the level.
Alright. I know I should have tried,
but I didn't.
Okay, so I'm a coward.
I don't know why, you tell me.
Gee whiz, why do I freeze
when she looks at me?
What makes people act
this way about people?
What makes anything?
"What makes the sun set?
"What makes the moon rise?
"What makes the tide remember to hide?
"And why does it soon rise?
"What makes a star fall?
"Where does it fall to?
"Why does its flight
Make a stop in the night?
"And wish as we all do?
"And what holds a cloud together?
"What makes the sky so blue?
"What makes the sun set?
"What makes the moon rise?
"Is it my love for you?
"And what holds a cloud together?
"And what makes the sky so blue?
"What makes the sun set?
"What makes the moon rise?
"Is it my love for you?"
Gee, you sing just like a bird.
Brooklyn!
Yeah! How did you know?
Flatbush!
Go on! Greenpert!
How do you like that!
Imagine meeting a dame
all the way from Brooklyn!
"Ain't it a small world,"
like my old lady used to say.
Hey, mister, you better sit down.
The manager.
Gee, are you all alone?
No. I'm here with a girl. She's dancing.
Oh, he's my best friend.
Okay. Maybe you know what you're doing.
She's a swell one, that girl,
and what a voice.
Yeah, she's wonderful.
She's just about the loveliest...
But you know something?
I can't talk to her.
I can't talk to girls at all.
I never know what to say.
What's wrong with you?
You're talking to me, ain't you?
You're different. You're from Brooklyn.
Most girls are so easy to figure out.
They are?
But you...
One time you look as if you knew
all the answers.
And ten minutes later
you're just like a little kid.
Just when a guy starts thinking he ought
to buy you a doll or an ice-cream cone...
...suddenly you're all grown up again.
I am?
And everything gets all...
kind of mixed up and interesting.
I mean, well, that's what Clarence said
about you.
He thinks about you all the time.
He does?
Yeah, all the time.
I'll see you tomorrow night?
At the restaurant?
If you don't mind going back there.
I don't mind. It's a swell place.
It has been a lovely evening.
I don't know when I've been so happy.
Good night.
Joe, did you hear what she said?
She has never been so happy.
And if you stop to think for a minute,
maybe you'll figure out why.
You mean, lturbi?
Why shouldn't she be happy
with that beautiful audition you fixed up?
"All of a sudden my heart sings
"When I remember little things
"The way you dance and hold me tight
"The way you kiss and say 'Good night'
"The crazy things we say and do
"The fun it is to be with you
"The magic thrill that's in your touch
"Oh, darling, I love you so much!
"The secret way you press my hand
"To let me know you understand
"The wind and rain upon your face
"The breathless world of your embrace
"Your little laugh and half-surprise
"The starlight gleaming in your eyes
"Remembering all those little things
"All of a sudden my heart sings"
You have to have a pass to get in, Sailor.
- Does Mr. Iturbi work here?
- Yes.
- I'd kind of like to see him.
- Is Mr. Iturbi expecting you?
- Not exactly.
- I'm sorry but it's impossible.
Look, I gotta talk to him.
It's very important, just for a minute.
There's nothing I can do.
He's very busy, he's recording.
Gentlemen, bar 95, please.
Rolling, Jim.
Stage!
So the Admiral went up on deck and said:
"Gunner's Mate, Joe Brady,
what do you think we should do?"
Joe said, "Well, sir..."
'Cause even in a battle, if you talk
to an admiral you have to say, "Sir."
C'mon, kids. It's Joe!
- I was just telling them about you!
- Yeah, so I heard!
Where's Aunt Susie?
At the studio.
I'd told them you'd tell us
all about your adventures.
Tell us how you got your medal.
Alright, I'll tell you how I got my medal.
Now, close your eyes.
Try to imagine the most beautiful day
you've ever seen!
With green grass, singing birds
and a shining sun.
- Can you see it?
- Yeah!
Now imagine me walking along
playing a tin whistle, as happy as can be.
- Do you see me?
- Yeah!
In those days we wore white suits...
...with blue stripes...
...and a white hat
with a little red ball on top.
I was so happy that I ran andjumped
and leaped and played.
Just for the fun of it.
I felt good!
Oh, it was such a wonderful,
wonderful day.
Suddenly, I slipped into a big hole...
...and fell right to the bottom of it.
I seemed to be in a long tunnel.
Way ahead I could see light,
so I started towards it.
Finally, I reached the end and found myself
in a strange land.
It looked, well, it lookedjust
like a page out of a story book.
And everything was hushed and still.
Like your room at night,
after you've gone to sleep.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
No music?
I can't sing if I want to?
Can I dance?
It's a law! It's a law!
It's a terrible law.
"I'll sing and dance when ever I will
No law on earth can keep me still"
Young man, there is such a law.
Our king forbids us to sing and dance.
Wait!
Where dwells this monster of a king
whose people may not dance and sing?
In yonder castle, but none can reach him.
"Trust in me, my honored friend,
I'll bring your sadness to an end."
Who are you? What are you doing here?
Just a sailor, visiting you.
- Why are you sad?
- I'm not sad.
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not!
You are!
I'm lonesome.
You deserve to be lonesome.
Lonesome is too good for you.
Passing a law forbidding singing
and dancing! Aren't you ashamed?
- I had to.
- What do you mean?
A king has gotta do everything
his subjects do, only better.
Well, I can't sing and I can't dance
so there had to be a law.
You can so sing and dance. Anybody can.
Well, not anybody that's cranky
and gloomy and grumpy.
But anybody whose heart is big
and warm and happy, they can.
Try it! Just for a minute, try being happy.
"If you worry, if you worry
If you bother your head"
I do!
"It won't help you, it won't help you
It will hurt you instead! "
It will?
"Grouchers, groaners, cranks and moaners
They're so unfair! "
I know!
"If you can't be gay and merry
Lock yourself in solitary!
"Though it hurts you, though it hurts you
Be a pleasanter guy!
"You may even learn to like it
If you give it a try! "
I'll try!
"You could laugh and sing and dance
As gaily as an elf, but
"Don't expect to get much help
If you don't help yourself! "
- Will you try?
- Lf you show me.
- I'll show you.
- I'll try.
- You see?
- It's easy.
Look at me! I'm dancing!
What a beautiful story!
And that's how I got my medal.
Recess is over.
What would you like most for a present?
Don't tell Aunt Susie I told you
because it's a secret.
She said that you and Clarence fixed it up
with a man for her to get a new job.
She's going to make lots of money
and buy us all wonderful presents.
What would you rather have
than anything?
Well, I'll think it over and let you know.
Don't tell Aunt Susie I told you.
No, I won't.
Joe! Am I glad to see you!
What about you? I got a feeling
you didn't get in to see lturbi.
We're sunk! I can't get through that gate!
What do you mean, you can't?
Joe, I've tried and tried but it's no use.
You have to have an appointment!
My name is Joe Brady.
I'd like to see Jos√© lturbi.
- Is he expecting you?
- Yes.
- I'll let you talk to his secretary.
- Thank you.
Hello, Jean.
A Mr. Brady from the US Navy
to see Mr. Iturbi.
When I watch you I get a feeling
that there's something wrong with me.
Brooklyn, you just gotta learn
not to get scared.
Hey! I got a pass, Brooklyn! I got a pass!
- I guess everybody's out.
- Okay, let's go.
Can you tell me
where Mr. Iturbi's office is?
Sure. Right over there.
Mr. Brady?
I expect Mr. Iturbi at any moment.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
- Have you been at sea recently?
- Yeah, I'm on leave.
I suppose you're having a wonderful time.
I'm Susan Abbott.
Someone made an appointment for me
to audition for Mr. Iturbi this Saturday...
Ever speak to sailors, lady?
Hello, Joe. What are you doing here?
Clarence is busy talking with Jos√©.
I was waiting for him.
We can go out and have a Coke.
Miss Abbott, I'm afraid Mr. Iturbi...
Jean, tell Mr. Iturbi
she'll be back next Saturday.
I'll be back. Tell him to wait for me.
Susie, you almost made a terrible mistake!
I just wanted to ask Mr. Iturbi what song
I should prepare for the audition.
Just what I thought you wanted.
Am I glad I was there to stop you!
Believe me, Aunt Susie.
Take my word for it.
You shouldn't go near him until the minute
you're ready to audition.
Why?
If you see him now and try to talk to him,
he's polite but he's busy. It's no good.
If you wait until Saturday at 11:15...
He's expecting a big, beefy character.
Instead, you walk in, you're all dressed up.
You look like a million dollars.
Aunt Susie, believe me, you'll kill him!
Come on. I owe you a Coke.
You're sort of Clarence's guardian angel,
too, aren't you?
Well, you're always with him
or talking about him.
Why?
I figured he needed a girl.
Clarence didn't want just any girl.
He wanted somebody he could think about
and write to.
And come home to.
I guess he found her, huh?
What about you? What do you want?
- What kind of girl do you like?
- Why?
I'm just curious.
Well, the kind of girl I like
is a very definite kind of a girl.
For example, the girl I know here in LA...
You mean, Lola?
Well, yeah, take her.
Nothing serious about her.
Nothing serious. Strictly for laughs.
If she sees you, great.
If she doesn't, she'll find someone else.
She doesn't tie you down.
I see. You don't want to be tied down,
do you?
That's for guys like Clarence. Nice guys.
What I like is...
Yes, what do you like?
I don't know, Aunt Susie. Right now,
I'm a little confused about what I like.
- I have a feeling that everything is...
- Yes?
Back on the set, kids. Come on, Susie.
Everybody works in the next shot.
Joe, why don't you come
to the cafe tonight?
You could bring your girl.
Maybe Clarence wants to see you alone.
Call the committee and tell them
I'll be at the camp.
But, Mr. Iturbi, you have be at the studio!
How will you get to the camp?
I'll make it. Tell them not to expect me
until the last minute.
Remember, later you have an appointment
with Carlos.
Yes, I'll be there. I'll be there on time.
Please, stop worrying.
Give me the Tchaikovsky Concerto
and get yourself a chocolate sundae.
- Your next appointment...
- With walnuts.
- How are you?
- Oh, fine.
You tune pianos or play them?
A little of both.
Hey, I know that song.
"Tonight we love
"While the moon beams down
in dreamland tonight
"We touched the stars
Love was ours..."
Sure, I like that!
You like Tchaikovsky, huh?
Tchaikovsky, the composer.
You must be mistaken.
Freddy Martin wrote that.
I've heard it on the radio a thousand times.
Well, those fellows...
they steal from each other.
"I forgot the words..."
- That's nice.
- I'm glad you liked it.
If I were you, I'd quit this piano tuning.
There's no future in it.
- You play very well.
- Thank you. It's nice to be encouraged.
- You sing pretty good yourself.
- Thank you.
Well, I got to go now.
I have a few more pianos to tune.
Goodbye, Sailor. Thanks again.
Keep plugging.
Se√±or Clarence! Friend of Susita!
The whole street is talking of
what you're doing for our Susita!
- I got a date with her.
- How happy she will be to see you!
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.
I must rush and tell her you are here.
Se√±or lturbi, he is well, yes?
He's well.
Well, look who's here!
And looking like he is at a wake!
Yeah, I got a date with Susan.
Don't you like her?
Sure I like her. I think she's wonderful.
Only, I'll be all alone with her,
and I'll sit here like a dope.
I won't know what to say!
What are you worrying about?
The first note I heard you sing...
...I knew you were a romantic fella.
You think I can just walk up to her
and start singing?
Of course you don't just walk up to her
and start singing. Look...
I'm her.
I'm just finishing dinner.
I'm toying with my coffee.
The fellows are beating their brains out
playing soft music.
I'm looking at you.
You're looking at me.
Okay. Take it.
Gee, you're swell!
Gee, thanks.
That's right. That's the way.
"The charm of you is comparable to
"A Christmas tree with toys
"With little girls and boys
"When first they see the tree
"The thrill of you is comparable to
"The thrill I felt when I
"First learned a heart could sigh
"And you were the reason why
"And yet, and yet
"If we two had never met
"I'd know your grace
"That warmth of face
"That only the angels get
"And so comparing you
"With all of these things
"Is all that I can do
"Because they add up to
"The charm of you! "
I'd give a month's tips to have somebody
sing those words to me.
Somebody will, Brooklyn.
Some girls, when a fellow visits her,
he brings flowers. Orchids even.
I'm the other type.
Me, a fellow brings four bottles of beer.
Why kid myself?
Why are you talking yourself down?
You're a terrific girl!
I better get to work.
Hello, Clarence.
I hope you haven't been waiting long.
- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.
Did you enjoy your visit with Mr. Iturbi?
I saw Joe at the studio
and he said you were there.
You know, Clarence, I feel as though
Saturday will never come.
- I can hardly wait!
- That's natural, I guess.
Until it happens, I just can't believe
that I'll really be singing for Mr. Iturbi.
Susan, I've got to tell you something.
It might change your feelings
about seeing me...
...but I've got to tell you.
Please, Clarence, don't tell me now.
I like you very much but we haven't known
each other very long and...
Sometimes it's a mistake
to say things too soon.
- Do you think so?
- Yes, I do.
Now I feel better.
I was afraid to tell you anyway.
By the way, where is Joe tonight?
Joe probably has a date with Lola.
He's crazy about her.
I mean, she's crazy about him
and he doesn't seem to mind it.
That's just to hold you.
Don't forget I got one wish coming.
Let's keep the whole thing quiet, huh?
You know, Clarence, I can't begin
to tell you how grateful I am.
It was really nothing...
But I've waited all my life
for a chance like this.
- Oh, mister, I'm so sorry!
- It's alright.
Come up to the kitchen.
You can dry off in front of the oven.
Yes, Clarence, you'd better go ahead.
So, I said to myself:
"Half of the year for 18 years...
"...your feet freeze, your hands chap,
your nose gets blue.
"Get smart! Get out of town! "
So here I came to sunny California.
My nose don't get blue anymore,
but the rest of me is always blue.
You're homesick.
I guess you're dry.
She's gone.
No kidding.
Don't worry. She's probably
in her dressing room changing.
With you around,
even with the palm trees...
...this feels like Brooklyn.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
The customers are sitting in the inside,
and the waitress, she sits on the outside!
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.
- You having fun?
- Oh, a swell time.
All you needed was a girl.
You'd better get back to her.
What are you doing out here?
Listen, Joe, it's kind of tough.
She's so excited about her audition.
Don't you think I should tell her?
That's what I have to tell you. I thought
not getting lturbi might cramp your style...
...so I found out we could see him
tomorrow at the Hollywood Bowl.
Don't worry. Everything will be okay
with you and Susie.
- Thanks, Joe.
- Yeah.
- Mr. Iturbi is in there?
- Yes, he is.
We're friends of his
and we'd like to see him.
Sorry, nobody is allowed in there
during rehearsals.
I got a dream I dream all the time:
To have a cop say,
"Glad to see you. Come right in."
- So, we give up?
- We don't give up.
We got him cornered.
Where is lturbi?
He just left, and he's eight minutes late.
Even you can be licked, Joe.
We just tell Susan the truth.
Okay, I'll go.
I'll tell her. It's up to me to do it, not you.
I'll go to the studio
and tell her it's all a phony.
She'll be sore, but at me.
I'll tell her how I pulled you into it
because you're crazy about her.
What's the use, Joe?
Our leave is practically up anyhow.
So what? Susie's not a girl
just for a leave.
She is the kind you come home to.
This will do it!
There's something I've been...
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I'll meet you at that little bar near Susie's
at about 6:00.
That way I can tell you how she took it.
Unless you want to come with me.
Are you just going to sit here?
Yeah... I'm tired.
"I fall in love to easily
"I fall in love too fast
"I fall in love too terribly hard
"For love to ever last
"My heart should be well-schooled
"'Cause I've been fooled...
"...in the past
"And still I fall in love too easily
"I fall in love too fast"
Brooklyn, I love you!
No, you love Susie.
I did, but I don't.
It's awful, but I can't help it. I love you.
I don't think it's so terrible.
Yes, it is.
Joe is telling Susie
I want to come home to her...
...but I want to come home to you.
Gee, I got a feeling...
I got a feeling I'm fickle.
You're going to marry me, aren't you?
Before I say for sure...
...there's something I gotta tell you
so everything will be on the level.
Whatever happened before we met
doesn't count.
But this was after we met.
It was?
You still don't have to tell me.
I wanna. I gotta.
Last night when I dropped the soup
on you by accident...
...it was no accident.
I didn't want you to sit with her.
Why, Brooklyn.
That's just the nicest thing
anyone has ever done for me.
Imagine, you were jealous.
But, honey, you'd better tell your pal
to stop fixing it up with Susan.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Because bigamy, I don't believe in.
Can I speak to you for a minute?
What would you like to say?
Perhaps I could tell you.
Clarence is a very fine boy, that I know.
You saved his life,
so you owe him something.
You've decided he's right for me.
Does that cover everything?
No, that doesn't come anywhere near it.
I forgot.
You like a very definite type of girl...
...and I'm very definitely not it.
Don't be mad, Aunt Susie.
I'm sorry. What is it, Joe?
Susie, what I want to say...
Well, it's not awfully...
It happens every time I'm with you.
I hear myself saying words...
...that never have anything to do
with the things I feel about you.
All I know are the things you say
and I don't like them.
Susan, I've never said to you
what I really wanted to say...
...because my way of saying it
just isn't good enough.
Then there must be some other way.
Sure, there is.
Right out of Romeo and Juliet
and The Three Musketeers.
All the books and poems.
Those are the words I want to say.
- But I can't. You'd laugh at me.
- I don't think so.
Well, then I'd laugh at myself.
Words like that don't go with sailor suits
and three-day leaves and our world.
They go with the world
of cloaks and swords.
If you lived in that house
then I could tell you.
But I do live in that house.
If you lived in that house...
...in some other time, you'd be a princess.
And I'd be a bandit chief
with a hideout in the hills.
A bandit who had seen the princess once
and could never forget her.
Then one night, he'd risk his life
to see her again.
Hiding in a shadow here,
a patch of darkness there...
You...
Nothing.
It has been a hot day.
Give me a scotch. A double.
Are you used to that stuff?
No, I never touch it.
It cuts down on your wind.
It has been a hot day.
Look, Joe...
No, Clarence! You look.
Sometimes things happen
that you can't help, see?
You meet somebody, it doesn't seem
like anything and suddenly it is something!
Gee! That's exactly what happened!
Don't I know!
It's wonderful, though.
It could be, but not
when you double-cross a pal.
When did you find out, Joe?
Today. But I've had a hunch
almost from the beginning!
You did?
It's funny, I didn't. Not for sure.
Not until I kissed her.
Of course, last night when she dropped
the soup on me...
...I should have known.
The waitress!
She's a terrible waitress.
You're not sore, Joe?
No, I'm not sore. I forgive you.
Is Susan sore?
No, I wouldn't say she acted sore.
Even when you told her
there was no audition?
You mean, you didn't tell her?
What did you tell her? What could you
be talking about all this time?
Just things. You know how it is
with things.
You're in love with Susan yourself.
You're going to ask her to marry you,
aren't you?
When? Before or after she doesn't
have her audition?
Iturbi! I gotta get to lturbi!
But where? I don't know where.
Where can he be?
He has to light someplace, sometime!
There must be some place he calls home!
Home!
Can I help you?
We were looking for Mr. Iturbi.
Will he be in this morning?
He gave a concert out of town last night.
When he returns he'll go straight
to the studio. Is there any message?
- No. No, thanks.
- Very well.
Gee, that's awful.
What are you going to do, Joe?
Well, I'll go to her house
and stop her before she leaves.
Don't let this spoil it for you.
You go see your girl.
You haven't got much time.
I'll meet you at the bus.
Do you want me to go with you?
Joe, I was afraid I wouldn't
get to see you again.
I wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
Aunt Susie isn't home.
She went to the studio.
I've gotta go back to my ship
and I may not see Aunt Susan again.
So, will you tell her something for me?
Sure, Joe.
Tell her that...
...I tried awfully hard
to make things come out right.
And that I'm awfully sorry
that it had to end this way.
You got that?
- Here's your coffee and doughnut.
- Thank you.
Mr. Iturbi, I'm so excited.
Imagine running into you this morning
of all mornings!
I do hope I won't disappoint you.
A disappointment? To me?
How silly of me.
You don't even know who I am.
Well, I'm Susan Abbott.
That's nice.
Your friends told you about me...
Clarence and Joe.
And this is going to be quite a day for me.
It looks like quite a day for me, too.
You know, I expected Joe
to be with you today.
But I'm glad he isn't.
That would make me too nervous.
You don't know him very well, do you?
Not really well.
You'd love him.
He's really a wonderful person.
He's Clarence's best friend.
He's Clarence's best friend.
And I know Clarence very well, don't I?
You wouldn't be giving me an audition
if you didn't.
And when is it going to be, this audition?
11:15 this morning. You didn't remember?
It isn't exactly that I didn't remember...
It's that you didn't know anything about it.
There never was really an audition at all.
Mr. Iturbi, I'm terribly sorry.
Joe and Clarence told me
that they had arranged for...
What I mean is that...
It's a joke. I can see that now.
Please forgive me.
Wait!
These boys, you like them very much.
Yes?
Especially this Joe?
- Don't you?
- Yes.
To throw away a friend in anger,
this is not good.
Perhaps if we talk about
this terrible situation...
...perhaps it will turn out
to be not so terrible.
"From the heart of a lonely poet
"Came a song for the girl he adored
"Though she tried very hard not to show it
"She was terribly, terribly bored
"But then the poet asked her
if she'd like one
"And her eyes shone
"And the moon shone
"And the stars shone
"Above them
"As they waltzed
through the evening together
"They were swaying
"To the music of enchanted violins
"He held her and told her he'd love her
"Till the moon faded above her
"As they waltzed
though she tried not to show it
"She was certain she'd fallen before
"And her eyes shone
"And the moon shone
"And the stars shone above her
"As they waltzed
through the evening together
"They were swaying
"To the music of enchanted violins
"The spell of the waltz was upon them
"And the stardust sprinkled on them
"As they waltzed,
though she tried not to show it
"You could see in her eyes a light
"And it shone with the love for the poet
"As they waltzed through the thrill
of the night"
Why not write her?
There is nothing to say.
Tell her you're sorry.
She knows I am.
How does she know?
Clarence, will you write to Brooklyn
or wash some socks or something?
You boys were looking for me.
What was it about?
It's too late now.
That I can tell. Come, we'll talk it over.
Come on, I haven't got much time.
- What are you doing here?
- Are you complaining, honey?
Joe, you stay right here.
Today I invited myself to your concert.
And because you might be interested,
I requested Admiral Hammond...
...to grant a young artist permission
to make her debut here.
Therefore, allow me to introduce a singer...
...discovered by the US Navy:
Miss Susan Abbott.
In about five minutes
I will introduce a young singer...
...discovered by the US Navy.
"Anchors Aweigh, my boys,
Anchors Aweigh
"Farewell to college joys,
we sail at break of day
"Through our last night on shore,
drink to the foam
"Until we meet once more
"Here's wishing you a happy voyage home"
