Needle.
Thread.
Anvil.
Forehead.
Thank you, dear. We're all finished.
{\an8}Tell me, what have you dug up again
inside that bag of mine?
Shh.
Please tell me what you hear.
{\an8}Music. You were singing!
{\an8}You did really well.
{\an8}- I'm so proud of you.
- Dad!
{\an8}All right.
Hi, Adam.
PROF. RAFAŁ WILCZUR
SURGEON
What's going on?
Read it.
Ahh...
Not there.
Right there. Read.
Go ahead.
"The Countess Karnkowska
will be dancing again."
Skip the part about the patient.
Uh, yes, yes, fell off a horse and...
There! Listen.
"Luckily, she went to
Professor Dobraniecki."
You're not a professor yet.
After a very complicated
operation on her knee...
We operated on the hip.
Well, hip, knee... who really cares?
Point is, they wrote about it.
The old man was elated.
We spoke earlier, and he promised...
Well, he... he implied it.
But it sounded like a promise.
So? Come on. Say it.
Look.
DR. JERZY DOBRANIECKI
CHIEF SURGEON
- Earlier this morning?
- Well, it was implied.
So how did you manage
to order this so quickly?
I ordered it a year ago.
A good doctor has to be prepared.
Get dressed. We're going out tonight.
It's time to celebrate.
By order of the Chief Surgeon.
He may not have promised,
but he very much implied it. For instance...
Maliszewski is almost retired.
Kalinowski? The old guy hates him.
So, who then? Wurtz?
He has some merit.
A man of great merit
and numerous achievements, certainly.
So are many of the others.
Hausman, Kopeć, Koperski,
they're all accomplished.
But remember what the doctor said
when he took over the clinic?
He wants young,
talented people with potential.
Like you, for instance.
You may not be young anymore.
But you're a brilliant surgeon.
You're only missing one thing.
You've got no potential. Do you know why?
Because you don't know
how to talk to the press.
Or to anybody else, for that matter.
And sullen doctors
won't bring in any sponsors.
That's why you have me.
Morning edition, buy it while it's hot!
- Hey, buddy.
- Yeah?
- Want some money?
- Yes.
- Do you have any more?
- Maybe, yeah.
- I'll buy ten.
- Mama!
You interested in new office wallpaper?
Make jokes, please.
Ah, you'd better stick with me.
You'll see, soon you'll be
doing surgeries you never dreamed of.
We'll be famous in all of Europe!
Look out!
Stop! Whoa!
Stop!
Son, no! Son!
Son!
Careful. I'm a doctor, it's okay.
Move aside, ma'am.
Does your son have insurance?
Do you have insurance?
- Does your husband work?
- Huh?
How is he?
- Rafał?
- He's alive.
- Municipal hospital?
- No, it's too far.
- The clinic.
- The clinic? What are you thinking?
Call the anesthesiologist.
Go and set up the operating theater!
We've got internal bleeding!
Staś, my son...
Nurse, quickly.
To the operating room.
Kocher.
Another towel, please.
Blood pressure's dropping.
- His heart rate is slowing down.
- More oxygen.
Large Kocher.
- Towel.
- It stopped.
Take over.
More saline.
Saline.
Rafał, he won't make it.
Continue.
Check it.
There's no pulse.
Don't give up, Staś.
Keep fighting.
Wait.
There's a pulse.
Let's continue.
Whoa.
Hyup, hyup.
- Is my wife upstairs?
- Eh.
Ever since Sir graciously...
...decided to marry Madam...
Uh, well, she, uh...
always stays upstairs, eh?
Good night.
Shh...
I can't make you happy.
Forgive me.
Where's Staś?
His mother took him away.
Who authorized that?
- Who signed the discharge papers?
- Doctor Dobraniecki.
- I need to bring him back here.
- This is a private clinic.
- The old man's gonna kill you.
- I'll pay, then.
Do you know
how much it costs every day?
I'll pay for it!
It's chilly.
There, in that semi-basement.
Thanks.
Clouds in the sky... oh, pray tell us
how to save Staś from this spell.
Boy's under the hat, girl's under the cap,
Jewish braid please enlighten, I beg thee!
Mother of God,
please come to us here. Now.
Please leave, miss.
May these ails leave for the woods,
fields, the mountains, and the clouds.
- Four forking paths...
- Right now, please.
And may they help thee!
Four forking paths, may they help thee!
Oh, may they help thee.
- Staś.
- Sir, coming here was not necessary.
- We're...
- Shh!
But sir!
Nothing can save him anyway.
Perhaps only a miracle!
Call the carriage!
Who do you think you are?
Taking a child away
from his rightful guardian?
Against her will?
Staś required immediate help from us.
Under those circumstances...
If you dare mention Hippocrates,
I will throw you out.
I spoke to the board.
In our exclusive clinic we have room...
We have no room.
- There isn't, but there should be.
- We do wish that there was.
Precisely that. We wish that there
was room in our clinic for poor children.
We've been doing everything we can.
Alas, it relies on the generosity
of our sponsors.
But, Director, as you know,
quackery and ignorance in Poland
are responsible for many deaths...
Enough with the ignorance.
Although, uh, the quackery
we could talk about.
Only briefly.
Just a few words.
But let's keep the speech optimistic.
Who am I supposed to give a speech to?
Thereby, with the considerable help
of the Ministry of Public Health,
we are opening a special
pediatric surgery ward for young patients
that come from poor families.
Thus, the Hippocratic Oath is fulfilled.
This wonderful initiative
would not have been possible
without the impressive commitment
and consistent hard work
of Professor Rafał Wilczur,
who from this day on,
will be our guiding light through this,
overseeing operations as our very own
Chief Surgeon of the clinic. Bravo!
Bravo to the Minister as well!
Bravo!
Such a ward for poor
children is a beautiful thing.
Thanks to people like you,
we'll finally revive
our healthcare system.
I'm not the one who's important.
The whole team is.
Such modesty is a beautiful thing.
Doctor, Kazimierz Szabłowski,
Polish Courier.
What can you tell me
concerning Doctor Wilczur?
Why don't you read the papers?
You'll see he's all over them.
Could you stop by
Ziemiańska later this evening?
That idea's fantastic.
- Unfortunately, I can't.
- Please reconsider.
You could meet a couple
of very influential people.
It's my daughter's birthday,
Health Minister.
How is the lady feeling?
Bring Marysia.
Candles!
FOR MY DARLING DAUGHTER
Plates and candles!
From Madam.
Madam promised to write again.
Once she settles down.
Beata!
Hey, tell me, do you like to dance?
All he wants is to be dancing.
No help at all.
What is your name?
Michał.
Don't bother the ladies.
Hyup!
Hyup, hyup.
Ho.
Whoa.
We're gonna live in the woods?
- In a forester's house.
- I promise you'll like it.
- I'm Jan.
- And I'm Marysia.
Let's go.
Hmm.
Jerzy Dobraniecki. Who's this?
She left me.
She's gone. Do you understand?
What?
Do you remember where Beata lived
before we got married? Let's meet there.
All right.
I'll be there soon. I'm on the way now.
Hold on.
Uh...
Do you know Beata Olszańska?
- No.
- Wait. Wait, wait.
Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.
Her aunt, Helena, used to live here.
Did she move somewhere?
Follow me.
Hello there, bucko.
FORGOTTEN LOVE
He's dead?
A robbery, surely.
You should be questioning
the whole neighborhood.
We think he killed himself.
Why?
Professor Wilczur's wife left him
and took their child.
He was likely devastated.
She left a letter.
Tell me,
what makes you think he was robbed?
I'm not sure.
Just a hunch.
But... Commissioner,
I didn't categorically state...
That's precisely what you said, sir.
I believe the suicide
of our Chief Surgeon sounds bad.
So when can we pick up his corpse?
There is no body.
You see, we only found a coat
by the bank of the Vistula.
Likely... it will resurface someday.
{\an8}FIFTEEN YEARS LATER
So, now you have no family? No one else?
The orphan Marysia.
I would marry you but... Sorry, I'm taken.
You're lucky any girl wanted you.
You bet, yeah. And you, my dear?
Okay.
Justyna has a cousin.
He's not bad-looking.
He has three acres, a horse.
You want me to marry a horse?
I don't need a husband. I need a job.
Mom made me promise I'd go to college.
How?
I'll earn the money.
Do you know anyone that wants a piano?
In Radoliszki?
Beautiful.
Really great.
Very beautiful.
And... And tzimes!
It's just that...
I am no musician, just a simple Jew.
Uh, I cannot play.
All due respect, miss,
but I don't need to buy...
...this instrument.
That's great, because
I don't want to sell the piano.
Then what have you brought it here for?
What's this game
you're playing with this piano?
I brought it here
because I'd like to give it to you.
- Give it to me?
- Mm-hmm.
Is that right?
Yes. For free.
I don't need it anymore.
I no longer have a house to put it in.
And...
Oh! Just put it right there.
You're buying a piano, Dad?
This lady wants to give it to us,
you know. It makes no sense at all.
But why would you need
a piano if you can't play.
Uh, yeah.
That's too bad.
It's a shame. If there was music here...
people would sit and would listen.
- And if they came, they'd eat and drink.
- Mm.
But musicians are expensive now.
Very much so.
Well, she plays, right?
Hmm?
I could give you a discount.
I'd be able to help in the kitchen
or the bar, sir.
We could probably use the help here.
My business is for me to run!
Guests are waiting!
Hmm.
Okay.
Now let me see.
How much will it cost, then?
To get this piano for free, miss?
Huh.
Go.
Slow down.
Here it is.
You'll be working in a tavern?
What will people say?
"Two vodkas and a beer," they'll say.
And, "Play a song for us, miss."
I won't stay here too long.
I'm planning to earn money
and head to Warsaw.
I'll bet you are.
Good morning!
{\an8}ROOM FOR RENT
Come on.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Shh, shh.
Stop it. Shh.
Oh.
So, then tell me...
What will I put in this report then, huh?
"I don't remember this...
I don't remember that."
You don't remember a thing!
You know who doesn't usually remember?
People with a guilty conscience.
Maybe so. I don't remember.
Do you remember how many times
you've gone to jail for vagrancy?
- Around ten.
- Uh-huh.
It's just... I'm not a vagrant.
No?
Then what do you do?
Searching, sir.
What are you searching for?
Problem is...
You don't remember!
Get him out of here! Now!
Yes, sir.
Don't let me catch you here again.
Stop! Stop!
Jesus!
That bloody Count! Oh God!
- No groping me now.
- Oh!
If you want to grope someone,
go to the ball in Radoliszki.
- How would I get there? We lost a wheel.
- Oh, shut up, would you?
Oh, what a lump.
We'll have to call some people.
We can't lift the wagon by ourselves.
Everyone's at the ball.
I'll help you.
- Oh great. Thanks!
- All right!
You take that one there.
- And this one's for me.
- Thank you, Marysia.
- Cheers, how you guys doing? Cheers?
- What about one for Marysia?
Marysia, Marysia. Come sit with us!
- Zenek.
- Then dance with me.
Go ask Ruta.
No way, she's a Jew.
And what are you?
A Pole!
A drunk!
I want to dance with you!
Peace be with you!
Welcome, gentlemen.
Please, come in, gentlemen.
Come in, dear Count and Baron.
Welcome, welcome.
I've got a special table just for you.
- Over here.
- I won.
This way, gentlemen!
That's the local heir.
Count Czyński.
- Move your fingers for me.
- Mm.
Nothing seems broken.
The shoulder does need to be set.
What are you, a doctor?
I'm no doctor, but I can help.
Lie down.
Why are you yelling?
Doesn't hurt anymore.
Pain is gone, my God.
You can see, country life
has advantages too.
Yeah? So what exactly are they?
Let's make a wager, then.
You bet your motorcycle, and I bet...
So losing the race wasn't enough?
Once I played for three days straight
in Monte Carlo.
Hey, come on. Get up and dance with me.
Let's go. Let's go!
Yeah!
Opa!
Hey!
Opa! Opa!
Hey!
Opa! Opa! Yeah
Hey! Opa!
- Hey!
- Whoo!
And it's finished.
- Have some.
- Mmm.
Okay.
So what do they call you?
Antoni.
Antoni Kosiba.
Uh, Zofia.
Zofia?
- Ah! How's the shoulder?
- What?
How's the arm?
Mm-mmm. Mmm.
When you get home
you should put it in a sling.
You should wear it for a few weeks.
- Or use a triangle scarf. Can you do it?
- Can you?
I'm going... to Radom.
So what's in Radom, huh?
I don't know.
Then maybe you're not going to Radom.
Maybe you're going to Rzeszów or... Cracow.
Well, that could be.
Then maybe you're going to my place.
It's the mill, yeah?
If you're looking for work.
I don't remember what I'm looking for.
Hmm?
One week, and she'll be mine.
Want to bet your motorcycle on that?
- No. Your mare.
- My mare?
Do you know how much she's worth?
- So what can I bring you?
- Done.
Three glasses. Accompanied by your name.
- Marysia. Just the glasses?
- Yes, yes, we've got our own cognac.
Why don't you join us for a drink?
Permit me to introduce myself, ma'am.
Count Leszek Czyński.
This is my friend, Baron Krzeszowski.
- The Baron is a connoisseur and admirer...
- I'll bring those glasses.
Hm.
So what did he say?
He asked for glasses.
What did Zenek say?
You spoke to him earlier.
Why don't you forget about that guy?
He doesn't deserve you.
I've got an idea.
If you lose the bet,
you have to work in this tavern
for a whole day as a waiter.
- You're trying to offend me?
- A bet is a bet. I wagered my horse.
You can bet a horse.
Bet your palace for all I care.
Your honor isn't something to bet.
As you wish.
No.
He likes you. I might be the best dancer,
but he really wasn't staring at me.
Here he comes. Countess.
Michał...
You put a spell on me.
I'm hopelessly charmed.
By your dancing.
Thanks for that.
And does the Count wish to pay
for the two empty glasses?
Keep the change.
Mr. Rosenstein will be thrilled with this.
Please, come back.
You can be sure of that now.
Unfortunately, you won't win
the mare. I'm sorry, Mr. Czyński.
I'll walk you home.
No need.
Then I'll just walk alongside you.
What? Anyone can walk down the street.
And if I feel like jumping,
then jump I will. Ha!
What? Anyone can jump.
Stop it, Zenek.
I will, when you marry me.
What would you lose?
We'll never run out of money.
My dad will give me the leather shop
as soon as we're married.
And I'm very strong...
I can carry you in my arms, you know.
Marysia...
My mother didn't love my father either.
She didn't even know him.
But he gave my grandfather a cow
and two heifers and now they're so happy.
First a horse, and now a heifer!
Am I just a goat?
Do you play chess, Zosia?
My late husband bought the set.
He couldn't play, but he liked having it.
When did he die?
Seven years ago, this Saint Roch's feast.
He was sickly.
In the mill, Zośka did everything herself.
- Including punching people in the face.
- I'm about to punch you.
He really was sickly.
He would buy books,
and study many languages, you know.
Well, Antoni, do you know
what matricaria cham... chamo...
Yeah, yeah. Who needs to know that?
A man should plant trees,
build a house, and make babies.
Why don't you go make some?
Would you be up for it, Zośka?
Antoni, sit down.
Okay, dig in.
Matricaria chamomilla. That's chamomile.
So, perhaps you are a prince, Antoni.
Or a baron.
Maybe you have overseas estates.
Yes, maybe I do.
Or perhaps I'm a criminal,
and I murdered someone. Hmm?
Mmm...
Could happen to anybody
when they're angry.
You could have a wife too.
Or worse, you could be a priest.
Priests are people too.
I don't think
you're one of those.
Who ever saw one doing
any manual labor? Impossible.
I just came to see
if you needed something before bed.
Mm... No, thanks.
I'm all set.
Sleep well.
I didn't mean
to make you feel bad yesterday.
I don't feel bad.
In any case, um...
I did jeopardize your honor.
If I could challenge myself to a duel...
I think it was your honor
that you jeopardized.
You made a fool of yourself and...
you should probably feel bad, so...
If there is some way
I might make it up to you...
Just leave me in peace.
I didn't mean to offend you.
When?
I just wanted to know if you needed
something before bed. That's all.
Don't read too much into it.
Zośka!
- What?
- Zośka!
Michał's leg's been crushed bad!
A tree fell on him out there!
- Is he breathing, Lesień?
- That's what they're saying.
- He's such a nice guy.
- Where was this?
The felling ground.
Stop staring! I don't pay you to stare.
I told you to be careful.
A guy walks around with his head
in the clouds and tragedy strikes.
That wood won't cut itself.
Here.
Buy him some meds.
That's not even enough for a doctor.
He needs an operation.
- Don't like it? Give it back.
- No, sir, thank you very much.
It's settled, then. Get back to work!
Or you won't get paid.
He must get to the hospital!
What are you doing here?
It's not a big deal. He's gonna be fine.
Please, I must see
Count Stanisław Czyński.
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.
- The family is currently having tea.
- Where?
Oh but, it's not protocol!
I have to announce you!
Hey! Miss... Miss, you can't do that!
Miss, please stop right now!
I'm sorry to bother you, but... there was
a terrible accident at your sawmill.
"Your sawmill"?
What kind of language is that?
There was an accident,
in case you don't understand English.
Your worker has had his legs shattered.
He needs... These are awfully poor people.
This is your duty.
Poor accent.
Not Parisian at all.
As for the matter
you disturbed our family meal with...
I will say only one thing.
- Leave the palace at once.
- Mom.
Józef here!
Marysia!
- We're not on a first name basis.
- Leszek.
Do you want to help that man or not?
Doctor Pawlicki is a fantastic specialist.
He took care of my grandad.
My mom adores him.
Well, there's not much I can determine,
under the circumstances.
God bless you.
May I have a look?
Are you a doctor?
A doctor? No I'm not, uh...
But I can help him, I know it.
Quackery is forbidden.
Please leave.
You could go to prison for this.
You understand me, sir?
I'm so sorry.
How about some help, Count?
Honestly, miss, the Count
graciously offered the payment.
I'll help.
Thank you.
- Hey.
- Will I walk again?
You'll dance.
I promise. I promise.
They'll call you after the surgery's over
to inform you how it went.
I'm afraid
they don't have a phone here.
That's right.
A lot of poverty here.
Strange, isn't it?
Michał's worked... steadily for three years
for you, and has nothing to show for it.
Well I think I deserve
some kind of thank you.
Would Mr. Count have me kiss his hand?
He's been working for you.
He worked for your motorcycle and palace.
Those pants from Paris.
From Milan. My tailor's in Milan.
Then maybe you should
have your Italian tailor make you pants
to wear specifically when
visiting villagers so you're not afraid.
- Since you're so fancy.
- All right, enough.
I'll call Pawlicki
and find out everything, I promise.
- Want a ride?
- No.
Hey, the cinema's coming!
We could see something together!
My treat.
What's showing, huh?
Bravo!
DON'T FORGET ME
Thinking of that girl?
The young girl you saw?
Yes.
Maybe you like her?
No, it's not like that.
Then... why did you stare at her back there?
You know her?
I don't know. I can't remember.
I've seen her once.
At Michał's.
She threatened to put me in jail.
Is that so?
For quackery.
Mm. A tiny thing, and she's posturing.
I'd smack her once,
and even you...
couldn't put her back together.
Well, did you like it?
Yeah.
You like movies about love?
There aren't many I've seen.
My mom liked them a lot.
She liked movies in general,
but she loved romances.
She passed a year ago.
My Dad passed recently.
I'm sorry.
My mom was rich, you know?
She had a house,
furs, even a grand piano.
And when... she met my father,
in one instant, she left it all behind.
She just left everything behind and...
followed him to the end of the world.
Where was that?
Close enough.
The Kozienicki forest.
Dad was a forester.
How did you end up in... Radoliszki?
Mmm...
By chance. Michał brought me to live here.
We're childhood friends.
He's really all I have.
Is he?
You live in another world.
I don't care.
You just told me about your mother
and how she left...
This was a very lovely evening, and...
- Afternoon.
- Hello.
Hi.
- What are you doing here?
- Visiting Michał.
The Count brought us these, uh...
An oyster flies right into his mouth
In goes lobster and some Chablis
He opens his mouth and smacks his lips
Caresses his belly, and so he eats!
How are you?
I'll be fine.
Of course you will.
The pain is mostly gone,
just itches a bit.
He definitely keeps rubbing it.
It's ready.
Enjoy.
Seafood is rich in protein,
as well as vitamins and minerals.
- Good for both brain and heart.
- But the problem's my legs, though.
Just try it, okay.
Mmm.
Mm. Very good fish.
Stop!
I want you to take me somewhere else.
I'm late. I promised Rosenstein, you know.
- How do you shut it down?
- Here it is.
TAVERN
There!
Why do you still work here?
You should quit.
You know, some of us
have to pay for college ourselves.
Besides...
this job's fun.
No it can't be.
Why is that?
Remember the time I came to the dance
with the Baron? The day we met?
- The day you wagered a horse.
- A mare.
But it doesn't matter. There was no wager.
Hm. We'll see about that.
Don't believe me? There was no bet.
The giant fool thought that if he won,
I'd have to wait tables here
for an entire day.
And you said?
Count Czyński slinging drinks
in a Jewish tavern? Can you see me?
No. You're right.
Uh...
Oh. Marysia, that's not what I meant.
I'm so sorry.
It's not your fault you're a count,
and I'm a waitress.
This could never work.
Walczakowa. You don't seem sick.
- You don't think so?
- Then why are you waiting?
He only sees sick people.
- Well, I'm having back pains.
- The only pain here is you.
Your poor back
sent three husbands to an early grave.
And you there? You're no better.
This house is mine.
And that quack as well.
So if you want to find a guy,
go to Radom, then!
Walk the streets for one!
Thank you, Mr. Kosiba. Thanks.
Next, please.
I'll take your queen.
That's fine.
So what's wrong with Walczakowa?
She's as healthy as an ox.
Then why did you examine her?
If I hadn't examined her,
how would I know that she was fine?
You're not jealous now, are you?
Mmm.
That's okay, you're not mine.
You're a free man.
But Walczakowa shouldn't come around here.
If she wants to get treated,
she can go to the doctor.
Not bother you with it.
That's exactly what they're there for.
I'll go butcher a rooster.
Would you like a rooster for dinner?
Who's that, Zośka?
Did you hire a new field hand?
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.
Stop staring at him.
You'll sprain your eye.
Don't you worry about it.
You should worry about
the good priest dying of a heart attack
when he hears your confession.
Don't worry about that.
- Are those four bags enough?
- Mm-hm.
- How long will you be gone?
- For a while. Maybe forever.
With your waitress?
I see nothing wrong
with waiting on people.
- It's as good a job as any, Mother.
- Is that how you plan on living your life?
If you dishonor your heritage,
you'll be forced to leave the palace.
I'm leaving the palace.
I'll disinherit you!
Where are you taking that boot?
It's my boot. I bought this one.
He's very young still.
We must have some faith.
Go away!
Your wife came to see me.
So everybody says that you were in prison.
That you wander the world
looking for a quick buck.
I don't know what I'm looking for.
It's none of my business.
But you're the only stranger around here.
I'll get no help from the locals...
You're a newcomer...
Why does it matter to you?
We've never met or anything.
It's useless.
No point in checking.
The doctors have already looked at it.
Can you move your big toe?
Who cares?
I can't bend it. I can't walk.
Can you feel anything? And this?
I do, yeah!
I'm so furious and angry!
- I just might kill my...!
- I meant the leg.
Mm...
You do feel it.
My wife went to the market.
She'll be back in two hours.
It's impossible alone.
I can't crawl to the river,
or put a noose around a branch.
This is all I've got.
Will you do it for me?
- Please! Will you?
- Put that away, you fool.
Please. No...
Please.
Will it hurt?
A lot?
A lot.
With a knife?
A hammer and a chisel.
What are you doing?
- I'm calling the police.
- Don't you dare!
You hear me?
I've had enough of your advice!
- Oh but Michał, I just...
- I asked him to kill me.
That's what he's up to.
Do you know how...?
Have you ever operated on a human?
I don't know. I don't remember.
Help me, please.
- You're crazy.
- If you won't, then leave.
This is no place for you.
You heard him! Leave right now.
Get lost!
Bite this.
Turn away.
Just the beer, Mr. Wancerz?
As usual, my dear Count.
Waiter!
Vodka!
- Right away.
- Make it cold. And hurry!
- Hey, come on! I'm thirsty!
- Zenek!
What?!
The customer is king.
Sit down.
Hey, your reverence!
Oy vey.
He's crazy. My Count,
I apologize for this.
- Zenek.
- Not at all.
Get off!
I wanted to apologize.
You were right.
It's no dishonor being a waiter.
Do you expect a hug?
I'll just leave.
Leave.
Run!
He loves you.
Go and love him.
- I thought I did pretty well.
- Uh-huh.
Instead of garçon
they just called me Count.
Even as a waiter, you're no good.
I should marry well, then.
Want to get married?
A waiter with one boot?
So what do you say? Will you be my wife?
Will you answer the question?
Yes.
Yes,
you'll answer the question?
Or yes... you'll marry me?
Yes.
Let's run away tonight.
Where?
To the end of the planet.
And where's that?
It's very close.
A small chapel in the forest.
I know the priest.
He'll marry us real fast.
Zośka!
Where's Lesień?
Send him to get the doctor!
Go now!
Here! Over here!
Here! Stop!
This way.
Come in, Sir and Madam.
Leszek, oh dear God.
He's got a broken leg
and a fractured collarbone.
He's unconscious,
but his life is no longer in danger.
Stop interrupting
and leave this house at once!
Ma'am, this is our home.
He's going to be fine.
Save her life, please.
I said save her now!
I won't pay for you
to treat the waitress! Stanisław!
Her skull is fractured.
I know that.
She needs immediate surgery.
She's in agony.
She won't survive the night.
- Operate.
- What, in here?
I'm a doctor,
not a miracle worker.
Even Dr. Dobraniecki
couldn't help this woman.
Well, bring her
to that Dobraniecki fellow.
I'll pay for it.
I'll work my entire life,
and I'll pay for it.
I'm only able to give her morphine
to reduce her suffering.
- Take her to a hospital now.
- Well, Dr. Pawlicki... Uh...
I'm not a doctor, I'm just here to...
Okay, Doctor, it's time to go.
Gentlemen, the stretcher!
- Let me help.
- Mom?
I'm here, son. I'm here, I'm here.
Where's Marysia?
It's all over now. She's dead.
- Strictly speaking, I said that...
- That she is dead.
She's dead.
What?
I stole them.
No... I... can't.
It's impossible. I can't do it.
How do you know?
After all, you can't remember a thing.
Scalpel.
Lesień.
The girl...
Marysia.
Your search was for her?
I don't know.
I don't remember.
Will she survive?
Not without a doctor's supervision.
{\an8}PROFESSOR RAFAŁ WILCZUR 1885-1920
- I'm sorry, sir, I don't know...
- Forgive me. Please, Doctor.
- You have to help me.
- I'm very sorry, but...
Nurse Jadzia...
Leave us alone, please.
Come in.
Thank you.
You are...
the esteemed genius...
of medicine, a famous doctor.
Only you can help me.
My name is Antoni Kosiba,
and I'm here from Radoliszki.
It's a... small village...
Excuse me, sir...
Your name is what?
Antoni Kosiba.
I'm poor, but...
The girl will die.
I've tried myself, but...
Without your help, Doctor, she'll die.
Don't be silly, please...
Don't make a scene here.
Please, get up, Mr...
Mr. Kosiba.
Ever hear of knocking? This isn't a barn.
It seems that yesterday
someone appropriated my instruments.
Perhaps a mistake was made.
Do you have any proof?
Proof? There's the proof.
Someone performed a craniotomy.
Impossible.
I can see it!
Personally, I'd rather
not get the police involved.
Dr. Pawlicki... you said it was nearly
impossible to do this operation here.
You said that in front of witnesses.
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
left her without care.
What are you staring at?
Go! Tell everyone that the miller's helper
operated with your tools
and saved the life of that girl!
- May I see the patient?
- No.
You had your chance yesterday.
Now she'll be seeing Dr. Dobraniecki.
Woman, you are crazy!
Dr. Dobraniecki didn't even see
the Count and the Countess.
- We had to go to Warsaw yesterday!
- Well, I'll be seeing him shortly.
I'm warning you,
I won't look the other way.
Oh!
Just one thing.
The Countess asked
that I retrieve that ring.
You see, it belongs to the Czyński family.
Marysia is alive.
She'll return it to them... if she wants to.
Where are you from?
I don't remember.
Do you have any family at all? Hmm?
Don't know.
And where are you working now?
I work in the mill.
The mill, huh?
After hours, then, you just, um...
you play doctor?
I help them when I can.
And just where did you learn?
I don't remember that either.
And tell me, is the mill
where you'd like to stay forever?
I'd like to.
Leszek.
She's alive.
Thank you, God.
Where's Leszek?
You had... an accident
on the motorcycle, remember?
Let's spare her
emotions like that for now.
Is he alive?
Count Czyński? Yes.
He's a bit bruised, but he's fine.
He'll spend a few more days
under observation,
and then he'll be able to go home.
But you...
You're lucky to be alive.
I'll prescribe something.
What's important now... is to pay
attention to any behavioral changes.
Marysia is under very good care.
I'm talking about Mr. Kosiba.
Amnesia often lasts until death.
Especially if it was caused by a trauma
to the head, which probably was the case.
There are occasionally times when
the patient starts to... remember things.
I understand.
And if that happens,
he must be accompanied by a doctor.
- So...
- I see.
If Mister, uh, Kosiba's
memories start resurfacing, then,
please remember
that I am at your disposal.
At any time, day or night.
Yes, I just...
Please Doctor, uh,
don't misunderstand this, but
I would prefer
if he didn't remember anything at all.
He's so cheerful.
And that's what life is about, right?
Why change it?
That makes sense.
I understand perfectly well.
Don't worry at all.
- You heard what he said.
- Mm.
He said that Leszek is perfectly fine.
Soon he'll be back.
- You two will dance again.
- He didn't take any money.
- How'd you get him to come?
- Shh...
Well, he's a very good man, then.
I arranged a spot
in the clinic in Lausanne for you.
What do you say?
You'll heal in no time.
And by the way...
Miss Lena, Duchess Wielopolska,
remember her?
Can you imagine
she turned down Baron Sułkowski?
That means that she's still available.
I thought to myself...
Are you hearing me, son?
I'm responsible.
It was an accident.
The police claim that someone...
mm, cut, uh, some sort of part.
I don't know anything about motorcycles...
- I killed her.
- It's your fault, yes.
No wait... Darling!
What do you mean, darling?
He killed her. Those are the facts.
This is what happens
when you chase servants.
If you hadn't gotten involved,
she'd be alive.
Let that be a lesson
and settle down now, son.
And you, say something, will you?
Well... Yes. Um...
Yes.
It's all right.
All right.
Marysia.
I can do it.
He isn't coming.
It will all get sorted.
Eat, eat.
First you need to get better.
I need to write something.
Good evening.
The Count is recovering in Switzerland.
Do you know the address?
- I wrote to him, but...
- The Countess said...
I cannot give it to you, dear.
I see.
- Thank you.
- Oh, miss, you...
Please don't expect any response.
So please don't wait.
I apologize for what I said.
- I just didn't believe.
- I understand.
You had every right.
I believe in science.
I want to study medicine.
A wonderful plan.
College must cost a lot.
And Leszek, then?
I left a letter at his house.
I won't ask what you wrote.
I didn't write anything.
Nothing?
Nothing.
He'll understand.
WARSAW COURIER
Józef, here!
Telephone Lausanne.
Could you say that again, Father?
The same thing. What she wrote again.
Dearest Leszek, I'm alive.
I'm alive thanks to Antoni's work
and the love that we share.
And what would help me
recover more quickly is a letter from you.
I miss you. The days are long without you.
I'm lost.
Oh. Mother's walked in.
- Would you like to...
- No.
You told him.
You keep telling me what to do.
"Don't just sit there, Stanisław.
Do something!"
- So I...
- You told him about her.
I did mention it.
- This is my future wife.
- Mm.
She'll be Countess Czyńska née Oksza.
Lovely.
- Good morning.
- Oy vey! Oy vey, Miss Marysia!
Miss Ma... Oh wow!
Ah-ha-ha!
The piano is waiting for you
right over there.
Someone wanted to buy it,
I told him, "Go away, man, forget it!"
- "What if our Marysia returns?"
- Aw.
How could I possibly... stand to face her?
I'll return. I absolutely will...
Antoni says I must rest longer.
Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay!
Ruta! Ruta! Ruta!
- Miss Marysia, Miss Marysia.
- Yes?
Uh, I'm glad to see you.
Because I've been thinking...
If we were to write a letter of complaint
that Czajkowski's kids are starving, huh?
Then they might just sign over
the land we fought over to me, you know.
Mr. Wancerz... Petitions are one thing.
I told you I don't write condemnations.
Oh, but why not? The letter you wrote
last time was so effective...
Uh...
Leszek is young.
And passionate, as you've seen.
Counts and waitresses
get involved, it's true.
But choose to marry
for names and fortunes.
That's how our kind does it.
Leszek mentioned...
that you want to attend college.
I thought so.
The heart says one thing,
but reason disagrees.
In this life, you see,
the winner is usually reason.
Leszek loves me.
Otherwise,
you wouldn't offer me this money.
Leave and forget about him.
It would be best for all.
Especially Antoni.
How does Antoni figure in all this?
He stole surgical instruments.
Performed an illegal operation.
More than just one?
He's facing jail for five years,
maybe more.
What instruments are you referring to?
They were used to save your life.
Pawlicki didn't expect you to survive.
He truly is helping people.
To legally operate, you require a diploma.
Leave and forget about Leszek,
and Antoni won't go to prison.
- Hey! There's a line!
- Where are you going?
And she promised that
you could go to jail for ten years.
And Marysia...
didn't take the money?
- So, where is she now?
- I don't know.
You didn't talk to her?
I'm too ashamed
to look her in the eyes again.
What's going on?
Haven't you heard?
Zenek finally came clean.
He tampered with the brakes.
Scumbag almost killed her.
And me, the idiot...
I'm not sure what I was thinking.
Farewell, my darling.
You stole the surgical tools, didn't you?
It was you.
Why did you do it, Antoni?
There was no other choice.
How could you do such a brave thing
for me? You could go to prison for that.
Antoni, don't worry.
It'll be all right.
It will be all right.
Antoni?
Have you seen Antoni?
When I got up at three,
he'd already chopped the wood.
What for?
For the winter, he said.
Nobody's reported it.
These instruments belong to Dr. Pawlicki.
I stole them.
- And then I repeatedly...
- I know what it is you've been up to.
Because of you, my wife is healthy.
Please arrest me.
Nobody reported this.
I'm reporting it.
I confess to stealing, as well as...
to illegally helping some townspeople.
Are you sure, then?
Yes, I'm sure of it.
Last name.
- Mr. Kosiba.
- No, my name isn't Kosiba.
Those documents, uh...
I bought from a thief, so...
She's probably asleep.
- Oh...
- She's still very weak, you know.
Marysia?
Marysia?
{\an8}THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.
FORGIVE ME, MARYSIA.
Marysia!
Marysia!
To the lodge in the forest?
Why would she go back?
Oksza is dead, Miss Beata is dead as well.
So, where is Marysia?
No idea.
If I were her, I'd look for my dad.
I don't understand.
Well Oksza wasn't Marysia's father.
- No?
- No.
Then who?
I'm not sure.
It's something
they never really talked about it.
"Ignorance is not an excuse.
It is a crime in itself."
Those are the words
of the prominent doctor,
the late but great
Professor Rafał Wilczur.
He knew of what he spoke, since he himself
helped the poorest. But he helped them.
Not gambled their lives
like Antoni Kosiba.
Doing surgeries with a hammer
and a chisel is a crime.
The accused was so convinced of his...
medical talents that he even went so far
as to steal the surgical instruments
of Doctor Pawlicki.
That is why the prosecution demands
a sentence of five years in prison
for the defendant.
Five years? Zenek's attempted
murder got him three years!
- Be silent, please.
- Antoni, say something. I beg you!
I will have you
removed from the court!
Now, does the defendant
plead guilty to all indictments?
I do, Your Honor.
Ahh... Speak up, would you?
I do.
Does the defendant
wish to explain himself?
The trial will begin
tomorrow afternoon at 2:00 p.m.
And how long do you plan to look for her?
Until I find her.
Who was her dad?
He could afford furs and grand pianos.
He had to be very wealthy.
Then why'd his wife leave him?
Maybe he lost it all?
She left because she was
in love with another.
Loving is one thing,
but causing a scandal that way is another.
Scandal.
Of course, a scandal.
Do you have a phone?
Oh, Doctor, look!
What's the news today?
Look, Staś.
QUACKERY IN RADOLISZKI
He was here, remember?
Stanisław, pass me my glasses.
No.
I refuse to do your bidding any longer.
I don't like your tone.
You're a self-righteous,
and a pompous, bumptious crone.
- I only hope he won't be found guilty.
- I didn't report him to the police.
- How many times do I need to say it?
- Master Leszek is calling.
Hello?
Given our past relationship,
I took the liberty to disturb you.
I am listening.
Have you ever heard the name... Jan Oksza?
I am not interested in scandals.
I simply need your help.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for someone.
Do you know this girl?
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.
Hello, miss.
This guy's out here asking about you.
How did you find me?
Thanks to my mother,
if you believe it.
- She remembered a famous scandal.
- Mm.
And that's how I found this address.
How's Antoni? Is he all right?
- Have you seen him?
- You haven't heard?
He's on trial.
All rise for the honorable judge.
- Where is this court?
- Radom.
Do you have a car?
He told me to lie down...
uh, he grabbed on here...
placed his foot here and... tugged.
My mother's abscess was growing
on her leg. She couldn't walk for a year.
Let her demonstrate.
Mother, let His Honor see.
So if someone was sick, well,
they'd go right to Antoni, you see.
You could always be sure
to find help there.
Plus, he never charged.
Although Zośka, the miller,
probably wanted him to.
They lived together in sin.
In front of God.
You all know it's true! Yes!
Everybody could see the way
she lured that poor guy in.
Dear, why wouldn't you say
that Jan Oksza wasn't your real father?
He is.
That's to say... My biological dad
was called Rafał Wilczur.
Although, I don't remember him.
He committed suicide.
They only found his coat, not his body.
How do you know that?
It's a famous story.
All papers wrote about it.
My mother told me.
He was a pioneering brain surgeon.
He was a genius, my dear.
Can you drive faster? Come on!
Thank you.
Thank you. That's enough.
I'm impressed with the display, counselor.
- Uh, what does this prove?
- Um...
What I am trying to prove, Your Honor,
is that the defendant could be a doctor.
However, he has amnesia,
and cannot remember any of his past.
All fine, but I need some proof.
Not a spectacle.
Of course. Your Honor, may I now
call another witness to the stand?
Enough.
We know what the defendant can do.
We have laws for a reason.
To practice medicine,
you must be properly licensed.
The law is the law.
Your honor, with your permission...
The next person I would like to call up
to testify is Professor Jerzy Dobraniecki.
A renowned doctor, Chairman
of the Polish Surgical Association.
We know who
Professor Dobraniecki is.
Professor, as an expert,
would you like to comment on the case?
On trial we have Antoni Kosiba.
But we know this man isn't Antoni Kosiba.
That's a fact.
He may be a doctor.
A lot of things suggest that.
Unfortunately, he lost his memory
due to head trauma.
Um... We have advanced methods
we use in our clinic.
Innovative, pharmacological solutions...
The most advanced
electro-convulsive therapy,
or perhaps even, if need be...
a surgical intervention could help...
The court
understands what you mean.
Thank you, Professor.
DISTRICT COURT
Do you think this Professor Wilczur...
knew how to do a craniotomy?
Apparently.
I love you.
Do you understand?
The professor is offering you treatment.
What do you say?
- It's her.
- Silence in the courtroom!
Silence! That's enough.
Name, please.
My name is Maria Jolanta Wilczur.
And that's my father.
Silence! Silence in the courtroom.
Silence. That's enough.
How can you be sure?
I also remember the defendant.
He saved my life.
What is this nonsense?
You can't remember him.
- You were what, seven?
- Mr. Dobraniecki, ten, actually.
And who cares?
I could never forget that man.
Professor Wilczur is dead.
He's alive.
- Mazel tov!
- What?
Mazel tov! L'chaim!
- Mazel tov!
- Congratulations!
Cheers!
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!
Kiss the bride! Yeah!
I saved a seat for Mrs. Wilczur.
Oh...
Leszek will be very happy.
I hope you are right, Baron.
Everyone hold still, please!
{\an8}IN MEMORY OF MY FATHER, RYSZARD
