Why is it that a father is
never able to tell his son...
howmuch he loves him?
He's never able to embrace him
and sayl love you my son'?
Andthe mother?
She keeps repeating it, whether
her son listens to it or not.
But that doesn't mean
a father loves his son any less.
No one can fathomthe amount of love
that amother has for her son...
not eventhe mother.
Because there is no measure
for amother's love.
lt's an emotion
that can only be felt...
amother's emotion.
Rahul, my son... my life!
The match between Woodstock
lnternational and Manor House...
is at a very interestingturn.
5runs and one ball...
Can Woodstock lnternational's9-year
victory spell be broken in just aball?
Captain Vivek Singh spreads his field
towards the boundaries...
...andthe two batsmen
take their positions.
The excitement amongthe students
is rising.
The tension is mounting.
Manor House needs five runs
in one ball...Will Rohan do it?
lt's up to Rohanto break.
Woodstock lnternational's nine-year
spell of victory... Seems impossible.
Nothing is impossible. The entire game
rests on Rohan's shoulders.
Manor House is confident that
Rohan will do it!

Of course not...
Where are you crying?
That's one truth andthe other one is
thatyou are very young...
Stop jokingwith me
early inthe morning...
What's the matter, Lajoji?
l remember Rahul
very oftenthese days.
Even l remember him.
But inthe last few days...
l have been feeling
very restless with his memories.
But why?
Listen...
We have lived our full lives.
Speak for yourself... l have
along life ahead... Touchwood!
Yes...
But l have to reach God's abode...
How will l face Himthere?
How will l explainthe reason, why
l couldn't unite my scattered family?
That l couldn't bring
my grandson back home?
How will l showmy face to Him?
Don't worry about it.
You are not goingto meet God anyway...
- Why?
Because he doesn't meet anyone
in Hell...
God... again your jokes
early inthe morning...
Hey you sweethearts...
Rohan!
Naani.
- My child.
What's the matter, Naani?
You look very sexy.
l know. Everyone says the same thing.
May you live long.
You have become very weak my son.
Now everyone can't be
as healthy as you are.
Oh!Just Shut up now.
What's the matter, Naani?
- What happened? ls she crying?
Then it's fine. l getvery worried
when she doesn't weep.
Just see... Rohan!
- Oh now stop ityoutwo...
Please stop crying Lajoji...
Please stop.
Your tears will raise alot of
questions in Rohan's mind and...
we won't have any answers
to his questions.
What do l do Kaur?
What do l do?
Whenever l see Rohan,
l think of Rahul even more
Don'tyouthink we should
tell him everything?
How can we tell him, Lajoji?
Yash has warned us against it.
Rohan was not even intown
when Rahul left home...
He doesn't know anything.
l think we should
tell him everything.
Where do we begin?
What do we tell him?
He doesn't even knowthat Rahulwas
not bornto Yash and Nandini.
He was adopted.
Rahulwas two days oldwhen
Yash and Nandini brought him home.
His tiny footsteps made aplace
in all our hearts.
He became Nandini's lifeline and
Yash's dream was fulfilled.
Nine years later,
when youwere born...
we felt that
our family was now complete.
l still remember
the astrologer sayingthat...
you fought destiny to be born.
Youwould be our strength.
Did Rahul bhaiyyaknow
that he was...?
Rahulwas eightyears old
when he got to know.
That was when Yash decidedthat...
the matter would never be mentioned
again inthe house...
Never again...
Rahulwas our son.
The eldest son of the house.
lt was atruththat could
never be changed.
But the fact was mentioned again...
Suddenly.
Andthat was Rahul's last Diwaliwith
his family... Last Diwali.
Oh Allah! Rohan baba,
you have become so fat...
that nothing fits you anymore.
What's DJ? Say Daijaan.

Mrs. Yashvardhan Raichand.
This's for you my son.
Fromtoday, the Raichand Empire
belongs to you.
Oops, Sorry Dad.
That's your grandfather. Salute him.
You know Rahul,
Thirty years ago he said...
certainthings to me inthis chamber,
which l will nowrepeat to you.
He said life offers you many
paths to choose from.
You must always choose
the one that is right...
the one where you don't have to
bend...where you don't fall.
Never take a step in life...
that will bring shame to
your family name or prestige.
Anyone can make money but earning
respect is not everyone's cup of tea.
l have not forgotten
his words tilltoday.
Even you should not.
Promise me thatyouwill follow
the traditions of the family.
Promise me thatyou'll never compromise
withthe self-respect of our family.
l promise papa...
that l will always keep
the family name flying high.
l promise youthat l will always
keep you happy... always Papa

You mean BP is high-wigh!
Yes, it's high and it's
why' because of you.

Please get these medicines.
Om Bhai, you must take care of yourself.

Yes, Aunty...he just doesn't
take care of himself.
You just keep quiet...
l don't want to talkto you...
Why?
- Why? What is Sayeeda saying?
Oh! l wasn't serious at all.
l was just joking.
That's surprising...
You have spoilt my two daughters...
Aren't they like my childrentoo?
Anyway, leave allthis aside.
The good news is that
they likedthis mad girl...
they have acceptedthe proposal.
- They have accepted?
Didn't they see you properly?
Shut up!
So youwill leave us and go...?
Some day allyou girls have to leave.
No way am l leaving
my father and going anywhere.
Even l'm not going.
- So then should l leave?
Why do you speak like this, father?
Some day you have to get married,
my child.
The only prayer
l have to the Lord is that...
the man you marry must
love you even more than l do.
C'mon...
l don't think such
aman exists inthis world...
Am l not there?
You did not eat, dance or eventalk
to anyone at the party tonight.
You didn't eventell me
howbeautiful l looktonight.
You look very beautiful, Naina.
Really? How sweet!
l'm sweet and l also lie very well.
Just go...

Hey Naina, you look very beautiful.
Are you lying or tellingthe truth?
- What do youthink?

Rahul, l think you should go now.
ln any case l wasn't planningto come
with you. But thanks for the offer.
Bye... l was lyingto you.
What's happening, Mom?
Nothing much except planning
for Dad's surprise party.
Nothing stays in
this child's stomach.
That's because there's already
so much inthere.
Rahul, How come you are
back so early?
Mom... These society parties are
very boring.
Really?
lnthat case you have not taken
after your father inthese matters.
He usedto love such parties...
because there usedto be
alot of girls there...
Nandini
He usedto getvery happy
watchingthose girls.
Nandiniji...lf l hadn't
watchedthose beautiful girls...
how would l have foundyou?
- What didyou do?
Your father brought
Nandini's proposal...
When he sawher for the first time
he was very pleased...
And said, he approved of her.
But he saidwe would have
to ask for dowry.
He insistedthat the girl should
bring from her parents' house...
lots of love and along,
long ladder.
lt's a great tradition.
The elders of the house choose
their daughter-in-law.
One can't trust these mad children.
No, Mataji... Allthat was then.
These days everything has changed.
- Nothing has changed, Nandini.
But these days children make
their choices themselves...
Nothing has changed, Nandini.
What l meant was...
- Nothing has changed.
But...
- l said it... didn't l?
That's it!
Your beauty is goingto steal
his sleep inthe nights...

Just promise me that
youwill keep her happy too.
Youwill keep my daughter-in-law
very happy.
Youwill keep Naina very happy.
You face has fallen as

By the way this expression appears

Eh Rahul, What's the matter?

l wishthat was the name.
But it isn't.
Naina... it's just...
- Rahul!
Ever since l can remember
l have lovedyou...
lovedyouvery much.
But it isn'tyour fault.
Just because l dreamt of marryingyou
doesn't mean you have to marry me.
And if you are worried
that l will miserable...
yes l will be.
l will feelvery bad...
it will hurt
alot too.
But life doesn't stop, does it Rahul?
Perhaps a few years from now
l can laugh at the fact that...
l loved a certain Rahul
who could not become mine.
Because he was never mine!
And my love story remained incomplete.
But do me a favour Rahul.
Please complete your love story.
Youwill, won'tyou Rahul?
For my sake.
Now say something quickly
before l cry more.
Even me.
Raichand.
The name andthe respect has been
givento us by our ancestors.
To honour and respect
them is our foremost duty.
And l will never tolerate
an ordinary girl becoming ahurdle...
in performingthat duty.
You didn't eventhink once...
about the background of the girl,
her status... her breeding.
You didn't give athought to whether
the girlwill be able to understand...
our culture... our traditions.
Willthe girl ever understand
our rituals... our rites?
Willthe girl understand our
ethics and principles?
Will she adhere to
the values of our family?
Will she...?
How didyou even dare to think
that she can be apart of our family?
That she can be a
part of my family?
How didyouthink?
Where did l think, Papa?
l didn't think at all.
l just loved...love.
Love?
lt's such apity that. l made
amistake in knowing my own son
l thought he knewme.
That he understands
the traditions of this family.
He understands my emotions...
he understands every breath of mine.
l was so wrong... so wrong.
l was really proud of you.
Youwere my self-respect.
Youwere my strength.
You have taken allthat away
from me... everything.
You have hurt me,
You have hurt me.
l never wantedto hurtyou.
l only wantedto bringyou happiness.
What have l done?
How could l bringtears to your eyes?
How could l bringtears?
Don't ever forgive me.
Please don't say that
l have hurtyou.
Don't forgive me.
l will do as you say
just as you say.
Bauji... Bauji...
Please don't leave us and go.
Get up Bauji...
Don't leave us, Bauji...
Willthe girl be able to understand
our culture, our traditions.
Willthe girl ever understand our
rituals... our rites?
Willthe girl understand
our ethics and principles?
Will she adhere to
the values of our family?
Today...
today you have provedthat
you are not my blood.
You are not my blood.
You have provedthat
you are not mine.
Papa!
You have lost the right
to call me that!
Made me a stranger in amoment.
Made me a stranger in just amoment.
Does that mean l have no
place inthis house anymore?
l am right... am l not, mother?
l'm right, am l not?
Then let me go... Can l go?
''Through smiles or throughtears''
''We shall never part,
through smiles nor throughtears''
''My blessings live with you...''
''to protectyou from evil eyes''
''My wishes for you...''
''wherever you go''
''May happiness and joy,
kiss your feet forever''
''lt's allyour blessings''
''Whether smiles or tears,
we shall never part''
''through smiles or throughtears''
Promise me thatyouwill never let
tears come to his eyes...promise me.
Now go!
Rahul...we didn't take
blessings from father.
we don't have father's blessings...
Rahulwe didn't...
Go Sayeeda.
Go with my son.
Wherever he goes...
l don't want himto miss the warmth
of amother's affection.
lf youwant to be someone in life...
if youwant to achieve something...
lf youwant to win,
always listento your heart.
And if eventhat doesn't
give you any answers...
close your eyes and
think of your parents.
Andthen youwill cross allthe hurdles
allyour problems willvanish.
Victory will be yours.
Only yours.
Youwill remember allthis,

Like every year

One minute, child...

Mr.Vajpayee had called for you...
he wants you back in lndia.
lt's his...
- What's the date today, dad?
6th Sepetember.
Pooja, Couldn'tyouwear
decent clothes at least today?
You came inthese strange
black clothes.
Do you know everyone was
staring at us inthe temple?
lf everyone was staring at me instead
of Godthen it's not my problem.
Didyou hear that, Rahul? She speaks
nonsense even on Bauji's birthday?
Today is father's birthday.
Today is bauji's birthday?
Look at her... From Poo to Parvati...
What happenedto you?
Please take it...
it's the offering fromthe prayer
But aren't offerings on
birthday done for the...?
l know. But Bauji
was a very funloving man...
he said even after l go
always remember me on ahappy day.
That's why every year on his birthday
Pooja and l've a special prayer for him
lf he hadto see Poojalike this today,
he would've been unconscious.
You must feel sadthat he
is no longer with you now.
Yes...we do.
lt's important to have the warmth of
elders in ahouse...
or else a family always feels
incomplete... lsn't it?
Don'tyou miss him?
Don'tyou miss?
Don'tyou miss Bauji?
You guys haven't had
your breakfast... Pooja, Krishi...
Come on... Please come.
Even you are coming aren'tyou?
l forgot.
The one who is not here
is etched in my memory andthe one...
who is right here,
l forgot about him.
What present should l give you?
Just return my Nandini backto me.
We have lost each other
inthis big house.
Just get back my Nandini for me.
l want nothing else.
Nothing else.
Listen...
What's the matter?
Your affection is quite overwhelming.
Yes... That's because you are
looking extremely...
what do they call it?Sexy'.
Krishiwill see.
By the way, that should have been
my line... Go now.
My bag and my coat.
- l'lljust get it.
Listen, day after tomorrow
it's Karwa Chauth...
Wow! So what am l supposedto do?
You don't do anything. Like every year
there's party for indians
You are leaving?
What is it?
He keeps popping up everywhere.
So Karwa Chauth!
- Yes... it's day after tomorrow.
So you must have receivedthe Sargi.
- Sargi?
Sargi... Don'tyou know what sargi is?
lt's aritual for karwa chauth...
it's somethingthat every mother-in-law
sends for her daughter-in-law.
Hasn'tyour mother-in-law
sent it for you?
Some elder person of your family
must be sending it to you.
No...
Don't worry. This year
youwill getyour sargi.
My mother... she will
explain everythingto you.
Greetings to you, my child!
- Greetings.
My son speaks so much about
your family that l feel almost like
l'mthere with all of you.
He has become apart of
our small family.
l hope he is not
troublingyoutoo much.
Dear child, Sargi is somethingthat...
every mother-in-law sends
for her daughter-in-law.
Some sweets, a few almonds and...
signs of marital bliss...
and lots of love.
l'll send it to you.
l willthink l have sent.
it to my daughter-in-law.
OKmy child l'll hang up now!
- OK.
At times why do even strangers
seem like they are your own?
Andwhy is it, at times...
that even our own people
become strangers?
Listen... Even l have kept
the karwa chauth fast today.
For whom?
What's going onthere?
- Somethingthat doesn't happen here.
Karwa chauth fast?
That too for me?
Why? Who am l of yours?
You don't have the guts
to tellyour brother and bhabhi...
how you are relatedto them...
Tryingto be a great tiger before me!
Let go of my hand.
Why has he held her hand?
- Let go of my hand.
l let go.
What if l tellthem?
Today inthe presence of everyone...
what if l tellthemthe truth,
what willyou do?
l don't think youwill be able to.
You are scared.
What if l do?
Then l willtell
everyone what's in my heart.
Really? ls that so?
- lt's abet.
Don't bet with me,
you might regret.
Maybe that's what l want.
But looking atyou...
l wonder if allthis is a dream.
Dream?
Yes... How can anyone
be so frightened?

You are mad!
My son has turned into
a complete Englishman.
No. Not at all.
Really, Aunty... Sometimes
l wish we were living in lndia.
And Krishiwould singthe
same songs that l grewup singing.
But we are here and l have become
mummy' from amother.
Why do youthink so, Anjali?
the culture is yours, isn't it?
Still... lt's not the same, Aunty...
...Just see... Coming!
Mad!
By the way, D...j... Daijaan,

There's a function in Baba's school.
They are rehearsing for that.
All of us are going for it.

Oh!Where is Didi?
Where's she gone?
Oh my God! ls this our table?
They do this allthe time.

shiningwhite army and seat us behind.
Why do they do it
always?... No... Aunty,
Where is that silly principle?
She has arrived, the cunningvixen.
ls she the Queen of Englandthat
she's got the table inthe front?
Please go you silly woman...
Hope your table starts shaking...
hope your chair breaks to pieces.
Shouldwe sit?
Already there have been a
lot of complaints.
Even lastyear at this function
you had created aruckus!
Krishi is performing...Very nice...
what's the big deal?
You just shut up and stop
this Englishwoman act of yours!
Anjali, she's right!
- You keep quiet.
My son's on stage...
l will at least whistle once.
No... No...
-Just one whistle...
How sweet my son looks!
He looks just like you, sweetoo!
God, Please protect my son.
Eh! Your son is just performing...

My son! My son!

Now singyour,Do Re Mi'.
Didyou do this?
Nowtell me something...
You must have been alittle nervous?
l was alittle nervous.
But someone said somethingto me...
and everythingwas alright.
What didthe person say?
- Just aminute.
lf youwant to be someone in life...
if youwant to achieve something...
lf youwant to win,always
listento your hear.
And if eventhat doesn't
give you any answers...
close your eyes and
think of your parents.
Andthen youwill
cross allthe hurdles...
allyour problems willvanish,
victory will be yours...
only yours.
Who saidthis? Papa?
- No. He.
Didyoutake care of mother?
Didyou get selected
inthe cricket team?
How didyou manage
to lose so much weight?
Why didn'tyoutell me?
Why didn'tyoutell me?
Come back home, Bhaiyya.
Please come back home.
Come back home, Bhaiyya.
Has Papa sentyou?
Rohan, nowthis is my family.
These are my people.
This is my world!
Andthe home you are talking about
was never mine inthe first place...
andwill never be.
You go back now...just go back.
You...
l have seen you again,
that's enough for me.
Go back.
Do you know Bhaiyya,
you often saidwhen l was a child
That mother lovedyou more than me.
l never liked it then.
l usedto get angry.
But today, l would like to tellyou,
thatyouwere right.
Mother loves you more than me.
She loves youtoo much.
And she will always.
She will always
- l know.
He hasn't forgotten Dad's words.
He will never come back.
He will come Rohan.
He will definitely come back.
l knowmy brother-in-law well.
Just get himto meet
mother and father.
Willyou be able to do that?
You know, dad...
l had a strange dream last night.
l dreamt thatyou and Mom had come
to Londonto surprise me.
Then?
- What then, dad?
The alarm went off... l mean...
why wouldyou and Mom come to
Londonto surprise me?
l'll speakto you later
The work's done.
Guess where we are.
- Where, dad?
ls it ever possible that my son dreams
of something and l don't turn it true.
Tell me where you are right now,
we want to meetyou just now...
You are meeting me
after such alongtime.
Present? Now...
at this time... here...
You meet me at 5p.m. at
the Blue water Shopping mall.
But tell me what
youwant, my child.
Youwill findwhat
l want right there, Dad.
What's happening here?
- l'm looking for the receipts.
What receipts?
- To returnthe clothes.
lf you have to returnthem, why do you
buy them inthe first place?
The country best inthe world
is our lndia... Right Mom?
Mother's stooge!
Didyoutape that? That lndian serial,
Kyon Ki Saas Bhi kabhi bahuthi.
What abrilliant twist!
The son dies.
Oh God! Really? Oh No...
You have given away the suspense.
What are you doing?
- lt's fine tillthe hugs
- but he keeps kissing me too.
- You have never kissed me so much.
Come home, darling... and see.
Lies! You liedto me.
Yes... l liedto you, Dad.
What would l have achieved even if
l hadtoldtruth.
l wouldn't be able to break
your ego.
What else is it if not ego, Dad?
That separates amother from her child
that takes away...
abrother from his sibling...that
throws a father away from his son...?
He is not my son!
l don't believe that he is my son.
Has he fulfilledthe duties
of a son? He didn't.
He did, Dad... he did.
He always fulfilledthem.
He only made one mistake... Love.
lf that is a crime accordingto
your law, so be it.
But isn't ityour duty as an elder
to forgive him for his mistake?
Butyou came downto punishing him.
What kind of punishment is this, Dad?
What punishment is this?
Just look into my eyes and say that...
you don't feelthe pain
of partingwith him.
Say thatyou don't remember him.
Say thatyou don't love him.
Say it, Dad. Say it.
l don't love him.
l don't love him.
l said it, didn't l?
God has blessedyou
with everything, Dad... Everything.
l just wish he had given you aheart!
- Shut up!
You irreverent child!
You love him.
You love him alot.
You love him alot.
l have got my answer.
You really love him.
Let's go back, Rahul.
lt's too much now...
This is not our country.
These are not our people.
We have set up ahouse here...
but have you ever wondered
what kind of ahome is this...
that doesn't have amother's
warmth or a father's blessings?
Let's go back, Rahul.
Mother and Father are here...
They are right here.
They are elders.
They are alittle angry with us.
But we will ask for forgiveness.
Rahul... l know
they are as incomplete without us...
as we are without them.
We will ask for forgiveness, Rahul.
Let's go back.
Youwill never understand.
To turn a stranger into your own...
andthento turn him back
to a stranger...
you can never understandthe pain.
l agree they are elders...
but eventhey don't have the right
to break aheart.
Eventhey don't have
aright to break aheart.
l think we should call him back.
Yash, lt was her last wish
to have Rahul...
Just wait for a while...l
knowhe will definitely come.
We don't needto wait
for anyone... Rohan.
Rahul and Anjali are leaving.
They are leavingtomorrowfrom here.
They haven't even come home.
lf you say to them...
Do you knowmother always
says that...
ahusband is God.
No matter what he says...
no matter what he thinks...
he is always right.
You brought Rahul home one day...
right.
We gave him lots of love... right.
He became apart of our family.
He became my life...
right... absolutely right!
Then... one day he left home
andwent away.
Wrong
You let him leave...wrong
You separated amother from
her child...wrong.
Our family shattered
to pieces...wrong.
Then how does ahusband become God?
God can't do any wrong can he?
My husband is just ahusband...
just ahusband... Not God.
Not God.
Nandini!
l said it... Didn't l?
That's it!
Ever since the day you left,
Bhaiyya...
mother has only seen you
through His eyes.
He is the one who gave amother...
the strengthto stay away
from her son.
Please swear on Him, Bhaiyya...
thatyouwill come home
at least once.
Just once, Bhaiyya.
Even if it is for amoment.
Even if it is for a day.
Let Bhabhi feel
at least once that
she is the daughter-in-law
of this family.
She is apart of the family.
At least letyour shadowfall
onthe photograph...
that has keptyour memory alive in
mother's eyes for the last ten years.
Just once, Bhaiyya.
Then you can leave
No one will stop you.
No one will stop you.
Onthe strength of that one memory...
that one moment...Mother
can lead her entire life.
Can'tyou do just this
much for mother?
Youtook my words so muchto heart
thatyouwent away.
Didn't even look back once.
Didn't come back even once.
Didn't come back.
Where didyou call
me back, Papa?
Did l have to callyou back?
Am l not elder?
Do l have to callyou back?
Am l not elder?
l thoughtyou didn't love me.
l thoughtyou didn't
think of me as your son.
How couldyouthinkthat?
How couldyou?
l broughtyou into this house for
the first time withthese hands.
You completed our family.
You fulfilled all our dreams.
How didyouthink...?
l thoughtyou didn't love me...
didn't love me.
l love youvery much,
my son... love youvery much.
Just...just couldn't say it.
lnthese ten years l have thought
aboutyou every moment every day.
l thought of you so muchthat,
l felt like embracingyou and...
tellingyou howmuch l love you.
Just couldn't say it.
Elders' anger is apart of...
their love, my son.
Youtook it so muchto heart that
you got angry and left home...?
And l didn't even callyou back.
Why wouldyou call me?
l should have come on my own.
Yes...
- l should have come on my own.
Why didn'tyou come?
Why didn'tyou?
This is your home...
You are the elder son of the family...
You are my son... my son.
And nowl have grown old my son.
l have grown old.
At least forgive me now.
At least forgive me
now... At least now.
Come here, son.
Son...
At times the youngsters
inthe house showthe right...
pathto the elders inthe family.
l keptyou away from your brother
for years.
Please forgive me if you can.
Forgive me... forgive me.
