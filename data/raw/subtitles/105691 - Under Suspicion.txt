Where do you think you're going?
For a breath of fresh air.
Tony...
He won't be back for hours.
Tony.
Tony. Tony.
You don't wanna do it.
Waiting for your turn,
were you, copper? Were you?
You're both dead now.
Come on.
Tony!
Colin, don't!
Colin!

Are you Mr. Aaron?
Yeah. That's right. Come on.
I don't suppose... I don't
suppose I'll be very good at this.
Nobody is. The important thing
is to get in the photograph.
Ever been to Brighton?
Brighton, no.
I thought I'd change the hotel.
Change the hotel? Why?
It's just the other place
got raided a couple of nights ago.
- Raided?
- It's all right.
I got us booked into the Radley Hotel.
It's a much better place.
It's gonna cost
a little bit more, that's all.
We'll go up to my office,
and I'll tell you how it all works.
Don't act so worried.
It'll be fine.
Is everything all right?
Nothing seems
to have been taken.
What do you do for a living,
if you don't mind my asking?
Do? I'm a lawyer. A barrister.
Barrister.
Yeah, I thought it was
something like that.
You see her down there?
Well, that's your woman.
I can't walk into a hotel with her.
Yeah, you see,
I was totally misinformed
about the type of
gentleman you were, sir.
No, I can't. I just can't.
Perhaps I could talk to my wife.
Your wife?
Yeah, she's an actress.
I mean...
She's never done anything like this...
Do you think she might?
I mean, I... If it's...
I could pay more, I mean.
Good evening. My name's...
I have a double room booked.
- What name, sir?
- Franklin.
It's a double room.
I booked it about two days ago.
If you'd like to sign in here, sir.
You have...
Thank you very much.
You developed a sudden interest
in hotel architecture?
Hi, Frank.
You're not doing illegal divorce work.
I'm tailing a suspect here.
There's a lot of coppers love to
see you put away, you know.
Wouldn't you think there
are better things to do?
On your own tonight?
Come around for dinner.
I'm okay, Frank.
It's Christmas. Come around.
Would you like a drink, sir?
A drink? No.
Not for me.
Would you like something?
The usual, darling.
- Champagne.
- Oh, champagne.
Champagne.
You can smile a bit.
Order a prawn cocktail, pretend
you're trying to impress me.
Impress you. Right.
I'm not very keen
on champagne, that's all.
Denny. The man I wanted to see.
Give us the car keys.
Didn't Bob bring the money to you?
Don't start. Just
give us the keys now.
- It's good faith, isn't it?
- Yeah, yeah.
We had a deal.
I've seen nothing.
Bob promised me 200 quid. He said
he'd bring 20 quid to your house.
You're months behind
with the payments.
I know. I'm sorry, man.
Look, we agreed terms, didn't we?
We did.
Don't make me feel bad about it.
All right, Denny. Listen to me.
If the money's not in your desk
at 9:00 tomorrow
keep the car forever.
Nine o'clock.
Well...
So, what do we do...?
What do I do now?
I'll go into the bathroom
and change.
Knock on the door
when you're ready.
Knock on the door when I'm...
ready.
There you are.
Excuse me, dearie,
could you open 46 for me?
I forgot my key. Thank you.
You're a witness.
You two should be ashamed
of yourselves!
Excuse me.
Excuse me, miss.
Remember what you saw.
- How much you get?
- Twenty-five.
Show me.
I have some debts to pay back.
So you paid the rent, did you?
You lying bastard.
How much do we owe now?
Give it a rest, will you?
Look, I didn't marry you
to live in a bloody office.
Hey, hey, close the door.
Whose is this?
What?
You've been with someone else,
haven't you?
Stop it. No.
You liar.
A client must have dropped it.
You're so suspicious.
Because you never change.
You're the one wanted
to get married, not me.
Now close the bloody door.
Get out of there.
Mr. Dangerous.
Where'd you get this?
A friend of mine brought it from Italy.
Give me it.
He said it belonged to Mussolini.
Come on.
Is it loaded?
Yeah, sure. Of course it's loaded.
Bang!
Don't worry about court.
That's easy.
We just need the photograph
and a night porter to act as a witness.
They might send someone to
the hotel to check, but no problem.
I sincerely hope not.
Hey!
Hey! That's my car,
you bastard. Get out!
Tony, get out of the car!
Come on. Get out!
I won his car in a poker game,
you know? What a loser.

Okay. Just take

Keep the guests in their rooms for the moment.
Make sure nobody leaves.
Are you all right?
Get some coffee.
I need to talk to you.
Were you in the bar
all evening?
Did you see anything?
Oh, God,
I can't believe the sound.
I just saw her...
What are you doing?
Well, you touched the door handle.
I'm sorry. I forgot.
I guess you can do your own.
No, do it for me.
My hands are shaking too much.
Did you book the room for him?
Yep.
Why'd you put them
on the top floor?
I don't know.
If you want them to be noticed...
I don't know, Frank. I'm sorry.
It's all right. Don't worry.
You stay where I can find you.
I want whoever did this.
No! No!
It was just a photograph.
That's all it is.
Oh, jeez.
What kind of casket
do you want, sir?
Casket?
I haven't got much money.
You better make it the cheapest.
Why so formal, Frank?
Can we do this in my office?
I got a lot of pressure on me.
It's gotta be done right.
You know Dave Waterston.
He's working with me.
I was Colin's partner.
You remember Colin, Tony?
Yes, I remember Colin.
We're not here to discuss that.
Look, Frank...
There's no need to go into that again.
We got your statement.
Do you know who was killed
along with your wife, Tony?
His name was Padouin.
He was an Italian salesman.
I don't know much
else about him.
You obviously haven't read
the newspapers.
His real name was Carlo Stasio,
famous painter. Rich.
- I mean, really rich.
- How did you meet him?
I didn't until that day.
His solicitor came into the office
about a month ago.
He said that they wanted
to remain discreet.
In fact, he said that Stasio wanted to
use a false name in the hotel registry.
I said that was all right as long as
there were witnesses to identify him.
Why would a millionaire go to
a dog-shit little agency like yours?
Maybe he wanted anonymity,
seeing who he was.
I mean, no big agency's gonna
arrange adulteries anyway, are they?
They're against the law.
They certainly are, Tony.
We're not gonna be able
to cover that up.
I know.
You said you were
in the hotel bar all night.
From about 10, yeah.
Never left your seat.
So?
The barmaid said you went out for 1
0 minutes before you went upstairs.
I went to the toilet, right?
No, no, no.
You went upstairs and did it. We
found your prints all over the bed.
Fuck off.
Is that the best you can do?
You owe people a lot of money.
So? That's not a crime, is it?
It's an incentive to commit crime.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
Pretend what you like.
You're not getting away
with murder again.
All right! Hey, all right.
Come on.
Dave, shut up.
Leave him alone.
Well, ask him, Frank.
Ask me what?
- Do you possess a gun?
- What? No.
What? You think
I killed my wife,
and then I killed a stranger as well?
Does that make sense?
Even to a monkey brain
like you?
Nobody thinks anything like that.
If there's nothing else,
Frank, can I go?
One more thing.
Have you talked to anyone
in the station about the autopsy?
Whoever killed them also cut off
Stasio's thumb as a souvenir.
Oh, Tony.
Happy Christmas.
What are you doing here?
Same as you.
- So, what's the news?
- Nothing.
Someone saw a smart, red car
outside the back of the hotel.
That's about it.
Stasio's wife.
Who's that?
No idea.
Interesting.
Just remember who's doing
the investigation.
- Absolutely.
- I'm serious.
I can't have you around me.
Mrs. Stasio, I'm Frank Vance,
the detective in charge
of the investigation.
I'd like to offer my condolences.
And if there's anything you'd like...
I'll tell you what you can do.
You can go to my house, my house,
and throw that bitch, Angeline, out.
Right. When might it be convenient
to talk to you, Mrs. Stasio?
Speak.
I've a floral tribute to deliver.
Drive down to the front entrance,
and I'll collect it.
Drive down, she says.
Thank you. I'll take that.
I need to give it
to the lady of the house herself.
She's not at home
to visitors at the moment.
She is at home. I saw her come in.
Sorry.
Wait. Please.
Could you give her this, please?
Thank you.
I can't help you, I'm afraid.
I haven't asked you anything yet.
Tony. Tony Aaron.
Angeline White.
I expected to see his wife.
This is the family home, isn't it?
She doesn't live here anymore.
I'm sorry you've wasted a journey.
Don't you wanna find out
who killed him?
- Do you know?
- Not yet.
Then why don't we leave that to the police?
Good day, Mr. Aaron.
It's not a good day,
not for either of us.
Don't you get frightened being
on your own in a big house like this?
Only when people like you
say things like that.
A Detective Inspector Vance
has arrived.
It might be better if he doesn't see me.
Do you have a back entrance?
We don't usually have a need
for a back entrance.
If there's nothing else,
I'll dismiss...
The wages are in envelopes
in the hall.
What did Stasio
need the oxygen for?
Was he ill?
He thought he was ill.
There was nothing wrong with him.
Goodbye.
Where's all his paintings then?
What are you doing here?
Please ask this man to leave,
detective, and not come back again.
Get out, like the lady says.
I warned you, didn't I?
Keep out of this.
Was she his mistress?
He was doing all right
for an old man?
I should take up painting.
I'm giving her 24-hour protection.
I'll tell my men to arrest you
if you show up here again, all right?
Never offered me
24-hour protection.
- Come on, Frank, it's obvious.
- It's gotta be Selina, the wife.
She's dumped for a younger
woman, thrown out, she's bitter,
she doesn't want Stasio
to divorce her,
- so she kills him.
- Absolutely.
Only one drawback.
She didn't do it.
How do you know?
She was at a party in London.
At least 20 witnesses.
She didn't do it.
And what about Angeline?
Where was she?
Come on, Frank. I know you asked.
I didn't have time to.
She says she was
with the family solicitor.
At midnight?
I don't want you with me.
Come on, Frank.
Don't make me have an argument.
Would it be all right if I take the car?
No, it ain't all right.
Go on.
I understand you represented
Stasio, Mr. Roscoe.
Yes, that's correct.
Why did you pick Tony's, Mr. Aaron's,
agency to fake the adultery?
I'm not saying...
It's all right.
I'm not interested in any of that.
Why Mr. Aaron?
Well, he'd done some work for
me a couple of times before.
Matrimonial, similar work.
I didn't really know him.
I see. What was
Stasio like as a client?
Very difficult. He was
forever changing his mind.
But he paid well?
Is that a question?
Why did you meet Angeline
the night that he was murdered?
That is a question.
Mr. Stasio had instructed me
to invite her here to explain about
the adultery when it was
already too late to stop it.
She didn't know?
Why didn't he tell her?
You'd have to ask her.
What time did you leave?
Very late. About 10:00.
What did you do then?
I went home.
Mr. Aaron?
Mr. Aaron?
It's your own fault.
I told you not to come back.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
You didn't. I frightened you.
It's a bit late to be
making pastry, isn't it?
I think you'll be fine.
You can leave now.
I don't wanna leave.
If I blow this, the two cops out front
will come running in here.
Give that to me.
I seem to be in more danger
of sudden violence than you do.
Is this you?
It has the curious effect of making
strangers think they know me.
Where did you meet Stasio?
At an exhibition in Miami.
I admired his paintings.
He asked me to model for him.
Now here you are.
I was an art student.
I decided to give up painting
when I saw what he could
do with his eyes shut.
An artist's work leaps in value
after his death. Isn't that true?
Always.
You must be sitting
on a gold mine.
Well, do you think
I killed him to make money?
I was just thinking out loud.
I could take this painting
to any gallery in the world
and get $20,000 for it,
probably more.
If you take it out, you can keep it.
What are you trying to prove?
It's a serious offer.
I wanted to show you, you care
more about money than I do.
Yeah, well, you've got more of it
to not care about.
It's signed.
Yeah?
All these paintings are signed.
I thought famous painters didn't sign
their work until it sold
to stop people stealing them.
People can steal paintings.
People can forge signatures.
So Stasio did something
really clever.
He put his thumbprint
after his name.
Only the ones on the wall
have his thumbprint on them.
The rest are worthless.
Pretty smart?
Yeah, pretty smart.
Now you've had the tour.
You hated him, didn't you?
Why do you say that?
He was an amazing man.
He was the most
powerful man I ever met.
But he was so obsessive.
And he became obsessed with me.
He threw Selina out. He said
he'd divorce her and marry me,
even though I told him
I was going back to America.
I didn't mean to stay with him.
Things just...
got out of hand.
And then he wouldn't let me go.
He said he'd kill himself if I left.
Maybe that's what happened.
Maybe he shot your wife
and then shot himself.
Yeah, sure. And then what
did he do with the gun?
So, what am I supposed
to be looking at?
You weren't there, Frank.
Look carefully.
Tony at the shooting competition.
Souvenir?
A souvenir from the war.
Why did you lie to me?
I don't have a license for it.
I'm in enough shit as it is.
All right?
No, it is not all right.
Get it.
I'd forgotten all about it.
Don't make a big deal.
It was here.
I swear it was here.
It's gone.
I know it was in there.
It's been taken.
Hazel was playing with it last week.
She put it somewhere.
This is the gun
you'd forgotten all about?
Good morning.
What are you doing?
May I ask, where did you go
when you left the solicitor's
the night of the murder?
Home! What are you doing?
Straight home?
I may have driven around
for a while. I was upset.
You'll have to do
better than that.
I had a few drinks.
I don't remember where I went.
What are you looking for?
Lots of things.
Like what?
Now this is a search warrant.
I wonder, would you mind
if we took a look around the villa?
Did you tell the police something
to make them tear my car apart?
- No.
- No?
No.
You see, I did go
to the hotel that night.
Mr. Roscoe told me
what Carlo was going to do,
and I wanted to try and stop him.
I wasn't going to marry him.
But I knew he'd fly into a rage,
so I just sat in my car.
You sat in your car?
You didn't go inside?
I should have told the police,
but I was so frightened.
I mean, it looks bad,
doesn't it?
I think his wife killed him.
She was 50 miles away.
Well, maybe she paid
someone to do it.
Go and talk to her.
Hey, listen.
I'm doing my own investigations,
not yours.
I'll pay you.
To find my wife's killer?
What kind of person
do you think I am?
Someone who needs money.
You could use it to move into
a nicer neighborhood.
My mother was a prostitute.
I like living here.
Yes, "oh."
Did you know your father?
Oh, yes, I knew all my fathers.
What time did your husband get
home on the night of the murder?
You don't think he was involved?
Good gracious, no, no.
I just want to clarify in my mind
the sequence of events.
About midnight.
He works very late these days.
I was falling asleep
when I heard the car.
What are you doing
harassing my wife?
I'm sorry?
If you have questions,
come to the office.
I have one question.
If you left the office at 10:00,
why did it take you two hours
to drive three miles home?
Did you go to the hotel
with Angeline?
I don't have to talk to you.
Oh, you do, sooner or later.
I'm Inspector Vance. We met
at your husband's memorial.
I've already been talking
to Inspector Aaron.
"Inspector"?
I'm gonna have to sort him out.
Can I have a word?
He'd had affairs before.
We had an understanding.
He swore that they were nothing,
and that he'd never leave me.
Until Angeline.
When he came back from Miami,
he'd changed.
He was completely under her spell.
Did anything she said.
She's a very persuasive woman,
very clever.
Are you sure
you're not just jealous?
Of course I'm jealous.
I've made myself ill
with jealously.
That was his first
American exhibition.
I was an art dealer.
That's how we met.
I had to give that all up
as soon as we were married.
No wife of his was allowed
to work.
I don't care he's dead.
I could lie, but I don't care.
I stopped loving him
long before he threw me out.
Stop going around saying
you're a policeman.
Stop going around all together.
You make me look like an idiot,
arriving five minutes
after you all the time.
Frank, I can't help it
if I'm ahead of the game.
Do you think she's involved?
No.
She's a bitter woman who'd love to
get her hands on the paintings,
but she's innocent.
It's Angeline.
The car was spotless.
So was the villa.
Frank, she's ice cool.
Like, today she came in here
and tried to hire me to investigate
the murders she committed.
I don't want you
seeing her again.
I know why
they cut his thumb off.
It was to authenticate the paintings.
Yeah.
Well done, detective.
You're not the only one working.
Frank, look, Stasio had homes
in America and Italy.
There's hundreds of paintings,
all worthless without the thumbprint.
Frank, she did it. I know it.
Everyone thinks I murdered them,
don't they?
No.
I saw a man on the fire escape
that night when I was in my car.
Oh, yeah?
What did he look like?
It was dark.
I couldn't really see.
Well, what height was he?
And don't say my height.
I couldn't tell.
Did you tell the police?
They'll think I made it up.
Were you happy with Hazel?
I don't know.
I'm not an expert in marriages.
Did you want to be
with other people?
Oh, yes. All the time. I love women.
I lose my head.
Do people know
what they're doing,
or do you think we're driven
by things we can't control?
People are capable of anything.
A boat goes down in the ocean,
and it's not the women
and children who get out first.
It's the people that are ready
to step on the others.
- You're so like me.
- Am I?
Don't really like yourself,
do you?
Things would be different
if I was in America.
I'd be a different person,
a new start.
I understand Selina. She's more
like me than I care to admit.
Nobody likes being used
and then thrown away.
So why did you stay with him?
I need people to tell me
that they love me,
and when they do, I get frightened.
I wanna run away.
You're not answering my question.
If he was so terrible, why did...?
There's somebody out there.
Let's go back to the house.
Are you joking?
Is everything else locked up?
I feel safe as long as you're here.
Well, I can't stay here.
You don't have anywhere to go.
Do you?
Look, I just can't get involved.
Why don't you go down
to the cellar and choose a wine?
It's late. I know
nothing about wine.
Then choose a bottle
with a pretty label.
Very funny.
Angeline?
Angeline?
I don't think you're supposed
to serve Bordeaux like that.
I'm going home.
Go on, then.
Why did you stay with him?
What?
Stasio. If he was so awful,
why did you stay with him?
I can't believe you, cross-examining
me while we're making love.
- You know who I am, Tony.
- Yeah.
I'm nobody...
but I've met Picasso,
Braque, Matisse.
I've been to Mexico, Paris,
the South Seas,
and places people only
dream about.
When I die, I'll still exist.
People will stare at me in galleries.
We're nothing, you and me.
We'll only get out of the gutter
on someone else's back.
Everybody can be special.
You and me,
we burn to be what we're not.
We have to be special.
And we'll do anything for it.
Wouldn't you do anything for it?
Oh, yes. Yes.
Frank, wait. Wait.
I can't do this.
You be the killer.
Okay.
All right.
Okay, I come in
through the door.
I kill them both. Shoot them.
I cut off his thumb here.
- And then leave.
- No.
Why didn't they try
and get up out of bed?
Why did they sit just there? Why
did they let you pick up a pillow?
Okay, okay. They're not frightened
because they know me.
That's right.
One of them knows me.
The killer never came in
through that door.
Look at the direction of the blood.
They're turned towards the bathroom.
Being very slow.
The bathroom's got a balcony.
A sash with a sliding lock. The
easiest window in the world to open.
There's no fire escape. I wouldn't want
to chance this as an escape route.
Especially at night.
Why are you assuming that the killer
left the hotel after the murders?
He went over the roof. Shit.
This window leads to the kitchen.
It's closed in the evenings in winter.
From here, no one can see you
if you walk back down into the lobby.
It's good, Frank.
There's only one thing that worries
me about this. Where's the gun?
Everyone in the hotel
was searched.
Checked the rooms, rubbish
tips, everything. No gun.
Walk back, will you?
Go through it again.
What did they do with the gun?
Wait a minute.
Where do those lead?
Yeah, it heats the water
for the whole hotel.
I stoke it up at night,
and again in the morning.
How often is it turned off?
Never.
It's designed so that the ashes drop
through to the tray below.
What are you looking for?
There's something
at the back there. You see?
You reckon you could reach that?
What make was your gun?
Come on.
What make was your gun?
Beretta.
I have to arrest you. I have to.
Somebody's setting me up here.
I didn't tell you this, but
a few days ago I came back
and the office door
had been forced open.
Don't even start.
But it's true.
If I give this to Waterston,
this is enough to convict you.
It's Angeline. She did it.
She was outside
the hotel that night.
Why? What was her motive?
She hid it...
Tony, I am holding
your fucking gun.
Keep this to yourself
for a few days.
No, no, no.
Two days. We can nail her, 24 hours.
What if anyone finds
I'm holding evidence?
Frank, what's more important...?
Don't you use our friendship!
Why not? Why not?
What else have I got left?
You were the only one who stuck
by me, Frank. The only one.
Stick by me now.
I could get in a lot of trouble.
No details about the will
have yet been made public...
Mrs. Stasio... Well, you know
each other, obviously.
Shall we begin?
The will is of considerable length,
and the deceased names
a number of art foundations
and libraries who are to receive
his diaries, sketchbooks
and other effects.
I'll concentrate first
on the main division of the estate,
the paintings, which is
considerably more straightforward.
To my dearest Angeline,
I leave everything I possess,
to be disposed of
as she wishes.
- What about us?
- I don't understand.
- It's outrageous!
- That's it?
But I... That's it?
She gets all the paintings?
There is no reference to you
in the will, Mrs. Stasio.
But I was with him
when he wrote his will. I...
When was this written?
- When was it written?
- December the 21 st, 1959.
The day he died.
That's ridiculous.
He changes his will so
that she gets everything
and that same day
he's murdered.
Oh, you bitch.
You couldn't wait.
As soon as he signed everything,
you got rid of him. Didn't you?
I told you, Frank. I told you.
She got his name on the paper:
Bang! That will is completely legal.
She'll walk away with everything.
Something about
Roscoe I don't buy.
Maybe they're in it together.
I'm gonna tail him.
Frank, what does she have
to do to convince you?
It's got nothing to do with bloody Roscoe.
It's Angeline.
I can nail her. She trusts me.
Don't go there again.
Leave her to me.
I'm just going to talk
to her, that's all.
I just wanna talk to you.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You were looking for something.
You think I murdered them?
- No.
- Get out of here. Go on.
I'm sorry, I have to be sure.
Stay away from me.
I can't stay away from you.
Everyone thinks I murdered him for his money.
I don't care about the money.
I know you didn't do it.
You don't know.
How can you say that after I find
you searching through everything?
How can I trust you?
Because we have to trust each other.
We have to trust each other.
We have to.
Come with me.
I wanna show you somewhere.
Can I have a word?
Go on.
Go away. We're busy.
Police.
Oh, no.
- Have I got things wrong.
- What's going on?
I think you better wait
in the kitchen, sonny.
You're in a lot of trouble.
I'm sure I don't need to
remind you of the law, do I?
Can I...?
- Can I get dressed?
- No.
They had a bit of trouble
selling this place.
I kept the key Hazel gave me.
I come here quite often.
No, the lights don't work.
A club owner lived here.
He was planning a robbery.
We just had to watch the place.
It wasn't dangerous.
Two other policemen
were watching his club.
I got to know his wife, Hazel.
I kept coming in to see her every night.
Frank warned me to stop.
But I wouldn't.
I couldn't stop myself.
Then one night another policeman,
Colin, got into trouble because of me.
I got him killed.
Sometimes I think my life is the same
bad thing played over and over again.
This isn't the same.
You're innocent.
You have nothing
to be frightened of.
But I'm not innocent.
I've never been innocent.
What about this man who killed Colin?
Maybe he's trying to get revenge.
I don't think so.
They hanged him last year.
People always think they're better than me.
And they are.
We're just the same.
No, we're not the same.
Buy a plane ticket
back to America.
Why?
Because really bad things
are gonna happen.
"Be lucky."
Frank gave it to me
when I graduated police college.
A truck ran over it.
It's never been the same since.
What's wrong?
You all right?
Angeline.
Angeline!
Oh, Christ.
You're a sick bastard.
What were you doing here?
Screwing her like last night?
You're in it together, aren't you?
Yeah, sure.
I want a confession.
All right, I confess.
You witness that?
This isn't right. We don't...
Shut up.
- Oh, come on. Beat me up.
- Yeah.
Let's do this one for Colin,
shall we?
What do you want me to say? I'll tell you anything.
I can't go to prison.
I can't go to prison.
You planned it all with Angeline,
didn't you?
You told her the moment
Stasio changed his will...
I told her, but I swear I didn't
have any idea what was gonna happen.
But you know who murdered them,
don't you?
Yeah. It was Angeline, wasn't it?
I don't want any calls! What...?
Tony?
Where?
All right. Wait there.
Just wait there.
All right, listen,
go to your office now.
Get the old will, get the files
on the Stasio family, all the letters.
I want the notes on all the meetings.
I want everything. All right?
Don't you cheat me. Everything.
Join you there in 20 minutes.
Sorry. Sorry, Frank.
What the hell happened?
I walked into a door.
It kicked the shit out of me.
What's so funny?
I've cracked it.
Roscoe is ready
to tell us everything.
Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, Hey, Tony.
Three, two, one.
Enjoy the last of the old decade.
Happy New Year, Roscoe.
No!
♪ Should old acquaintance be forgot ♪
♪ And never brought to mind ♪
♪ For auld lang syne, my dear ♪ ♪
- Frank, come on, let's call somebody.
- For God's sake.
There's a note.
He's left a note.
Hey.
Just help me turn him over,
will you? Come on.
Oh, God.
What's that? Pick it up.
What's it say?
Come on, what's it say?
Tony?
- What is your current profession?
- I'm a private detective.
What does the majority
of your work consist of?
It varies.
Well, I understand
you have a speciality.
Well, I do a lot of matrimonial work.
You falsify adulteries to
enable people to get divorces.
I like to think I help unhappy people
to put their lives back together.
You make it sound like a charity.
But of course, it isn't a charity, is it?
You make money
out of other people's misery.
What? Like barristers, you mean?
As I understand it,
you would make your wife
go to bed with these men,
then go to court and testify
to witnessing their adultery.
Is that more or less what you did?
More or less.
And how many, approximately,
of these dirty weekends
did you arrange?
I don't know. A dozen, maybe.
Yes, well, let's not argue with that
figure for the moment. A dozen.
So on at least a dozen occasions,
you went to court and lied.
And you lied, and you lied again.
Well...
Doesn't inspire much confidence
in you telling the truth now, does it?
Why did you leave
the police force?
Well...
a friend of mine was killed and...
And what, Mr. Aaron?
I couldn't take the pressure.
I had to leave.
Weren't you told to resign
in return for charges
being dropped against you?
That's enough, Mr. Jenkins.
The jury will ignore that last remark.
Mr. Aaron,
why did you marry your wife?
What? That's a stupid question.
Well, stupid or not,
why did you marry your wife?
The same reason everybody does.
Because I loved her.
I don't believe that's the truth.
Tony bought a car off me a couple
years ago and we got to be friends.
He was seeing this married woman
at the time.
This was Hazel Powers?
Yeah, that's right.
Then the copper was killed by
Powers, and he was tried and hung.
Tony and I were drinking one night.
He said he was gonna marry Hazel.
I couldn't believe it.
Because all he'd ever said before
was she was just a good...
Yes?
Good in bed.
I never thought
he really cared about her.
I said this to him, and he just laughed.
He said, "Have you seen her house?"
Do you know how much money
she's got?"
He didn't leave much doubt
about why he was marrying her.
Did you see Mr. Aaron
subsequent to the marriage?
After they got married, Tony found
out this guy Powers had huge debts.
He was virtually bankrupt.
His club was sold,
his house was put on the market,
and Hazel didn't end up
with anything.
He was really mad
when he found out.
He said he'd made
the biggest mistake of his life.
Mr. Aaron, were you aware that
your wife had an insurance policy
through the trade union
of which she was a member?
No.
I wasn't until I went
through her things...
Can you recall the conditions
of the policy?
I just read it through once.
You stood to gain 1000 pounds
in the event of her death.
It's a standard insurance policy.
Thank you. That's all for now.
I can say with complete confidence,
this is the gun that killed them both.
They asked him twice
if he owned a gun.
He denied it both times.
Is this your gun?
I said, is this your gun, Mr. Aaron?
It looks like my gun.
How did it come to be
in the boiler room of the hotel?
It was stolen from me.
I had a break-in in my office.
Really? And when did you
report it stolen?
I didn't know anything was missing
at the time.
I didn't realize
until after the murders.
And were there any witnesses
to this alleged break-in?
Yes, a client I was helping.
He was with me.
Who is this man?
He's a barrister.
Oh, and we'll get a chance
to talk to this barrister, will we?
He doesn't want to appear in court.
Really?
Well, that'll be the first barrister
to be shy of appearing in court.
So, what you're telling us is that no one
can substantiate this alleged break-in.
Yes, this barrister can.
Yes. Well...
Why did you have a gun?
I mean, did you use it
to threaten people?
- Really, my lord, I must object.
- I'm trying to understand.
I mean, why did you have a gun?
I don't know. I just kept it, that's all.
When did you apply
for a gun license?
I didn't have a license for it.
We've got to get that barrister to talk.
He won't. I tried.
And then later the same day.
The Beretta was fired
three times in all
from a distance of
less than four feet,
using one of the bedroom pillows
to muffle the noise.
Stasio was hit twice.
Give this to Frank.
The first bullet penetrated
his chest and his heart,
and in all probability he was already
dead when the second shot was fired.
You've made yourself hard to meet.
I'm afraid you're wasting your time, detective.
I've already told...
Is he telling the truth
about the break-in?
I can't help you, I'm afraid.
My reputation is at stake.
Sod your reputation.
Is he telling the truth?
I have nothing to say.
Now, please leave me alone.
Is there room for me?
Look, I'd like to remind you
who I am, detective.
I won't be bullied...
I'm not giving you a choice.
This is a man's life.
Or do you want me to tell your fancy
friends what kind of person you are?
This your coat?
I had paid Mr. Aaron to arrange
for myself and a woman
to be photographed together
to help me obtain a divorce.
He met me at Brighton Station.
Then we went back to his office
to sign some papers.
I immediately noticed
something was wrong.
The door had been forced open.
Mr. Aaron checked
in his desk and around,
but couldn't see anything missing,
and we continued with our business.
But there were definite signs
of a break-in?
Yes. Yes, there were.
You're part of the prosecution.
I'm still not certain...
Part of the prosecution, Frank!
You can't go looking for evidence
for the bloody defense.
I'm not sure anymore.
You've got the gun.
What more do you want?
You know he did it,
you just don't wanna believe it.
Waterston knows something.
What's he got up his sleeve?
I mean, there's a gun, yes.
Even the suicide note.
They're damning,
but they're circumstantial.
Nothing directly connects you.
There are no eyewitnesses.
So he's got to have something more.
But there isn't anything more.
I went to the hotel that night
to wait for Carlo.
I was going to drive him home
after the photograph.
I was there for about half an hour
when I saw something.
What did you see?
I saw someone climb
over the roof of the hotel.
They stopped for a moment
and then they climbed into a window.
That's the kitchen window.
That's the third floor window
at the front of the hotel.
Yes.
Did you see who it was?
It was definitely a man,
from their clothes,
but it was dark.
I couldn't see them very well.
So you have no idea
who it might have been?
I know exactly who it was.
You said it was dark.
How can you be so sure?
Before they went back
inside the hotel,
they stopped to light a cigarette.
You could see their face in the light?
From that distance?
No, but...
they had a lighter,
and it didn't work properly
so they tapped it
against their hand,
and then they shook it twice,
and then tried to light it.
It was such an individual way
of lighting a cigarette.
I forgot all about it,
until I saw Tony Aaron do exactly
the same thing with his lighter.
Liar! She's a liar!
She's making it up!
Sit down, Mr. Aaron.
She's making it up.
What did she buy? The woman
who was just in here.
An airplane ticket for America.
Why do you want to know?
- One-way ticket?
- Yes.
You have seen the evidence:
The solicitor's letter,
the gun.
You've seen the shocking
photographs of the dead.
Now, you must be thinking, what kind
of person could commit this atrocity?
A man thrown out
of the police force,
who, by his own confession, makes
his living by fraud and deception.
A man who has perjured
himself regularly in court
for the past two years.
A man who was desperate for money.
And I suggest to you
was prepared to do anything
to get it.
I know things look bad
and I'm no angel.
I've done things wrong.
But I didn't do this.
Somebody stole my gun and tried to frame me.
Now, that's what happened.
Why should I kill my wife?
I mean, I could just divorce her.
I mean, they're saying
I killed my wife for 1000 pounds
and then killed this man as well
so that people wouldn't suspect me.
It's sick. It's...
I couldn't do
anything like that.
I don't deny I've lied. I've done
a lot of things wrong in my life.
But not this.
God, not this.
Someone in the jury's smiling.
It's gonna be all right.
Have you reached a verdict
that is the verdict of you all?
We have.
And to the charge of murder,
do you find the defendant
guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
No. No. I'm innocent.
No. No. Get off me.
Get off me. No!
I'm innocent. It wasn't me.
It wasn't me! I'm innocent!
I'm innocent, I tell you!
She's clean.
I followed her everywhere.
- I've turned in my appeal.
- Oh, Christ.
She did it, Frank. She did it.
What can I do?
I can't do anything more.
Do you know what I get in here?
I get these two pricks
watching me night and day.
Saying, do I want
a game of dominoes?
Do I wanna play
a game of dominoes?
I'm being hung in the morning.
Don't just tell me
you can't do anything.
Search the house again.
I can't get another warrant to search
the same place without new evidence.
When I was in Stasio's studio,
she found me and went crazy.
Search the house again.
Eat your steak
before it gets cold, Tony.
Fuck steak!
Frank, find something.
Search the house again.
Paul, it's me. Call the airports.
If she turns up anywhere, try and get
customs to hold on to her for a while.
Think of something.
Yeah, well, just fucking do it.
- I can't answer that question.
- No word of a pardon.
I'm sorry, you'll have to ask
the press officer.
You'll have to ask the press
officer about that as well.
Sorry, I can't help you.
- It's time to go, sir.
- Yeah.
I'm afraid the governor is unavailable
for comment at the moment. No.
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm not gonna make it.
No, no. Wait! Hey, guys, wait!
Please! I didn't do it. I didn't do it!
I didn't do it! Wait!
For God's sake, I didn't do this.
I didn't do it.
Come on, lad. Behave.
I swear to God, I'm innocent.
Jesus. God. Jesus. God.
I'm innocent. I didn't do this.
Listen to me. I'm innocent.
Please, I didn't do this.
I swear I didn't.
No, I don't want that!
I'm innocent.
Don't go away.
Please, stay. It wasn't me.
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?
Innocent. I'm innocent.
Please, I'm innocent.
I'm innocent!
What's wrong?
Don't wanna go or something?
- Bye.
- Good.
You leaving Brighton?
That sounded like a command.
- I didn't mean...
- I know.
Well, there's still a lot of
people you owe money to.
Yeah.
- What? No, Frank.
- Go on.
No.
Buy yourself a suit and a shave.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
Life's too short.
Well, look, I'll see you around.
I don't think so.
It's not visiting day.
Frank swung it for me.
I thought you'd like
some fresh air.
So where are you going?
Oh, America.
I was going there.
I didn't quite make it, though.
So how much did she pay you?
- What?
- Selina.
Please, don't start.
She's certainly got enough now.
You should at least get half,
all the risks you've taken.
You were bound to go to prison
for fixing the divorces.
That threw people off the scent.
You thought,
"Six months for double murder,
that can't be bad."
I didn't come here for this.
You, searching through my things,
looking for evidence.
- You remember?
- Sure, I remember.
But you weren't searching
for evidence, were you?
You were planting it
for Frank to find.
You only got to know me
so you could set me up.
Goodbye, Angeline.
Then who killed them,
if it wasn't you?
You did.
You're trying to drag somebody
down with you even now.
You killed them.
That's why you're doing life.
Think yourself lucky you're not a man.
They'd have hanged you.
Oh, I'll think myself lucky.
Don't go.
I've got a boat to catch.
I miss you.
I miss you every day.
I'm sorry nothing
turned out right.
Tony, you have to tell me.
I'm gonna go crazy in here
not knowing for sure. Please.
Just tell me. No one will believe
me, no matter what I say.
I've got to know.
Just tell me once.
Did you do it?
Did you?
Whisper.
Did you?
Did you do it?
Is he in?
I've only put 30 paintings
on the market, but I could sell the lot.
Everything.
I want to wait a while,
until the prices go up.
We're going to be very rich.
You know, I might make you an offer
for your Stasio one day.
You said she was only after
his money, but she wasn't.
She just wanted to be somebody.
Who cares?
She's out of the way now.
You fell in love with her,
didn't you?
That's why you waited so long
to plant the evidence.
No.
No, it was just business.
Come on, Tony. You've got
everything you always wanted.
