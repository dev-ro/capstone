'I don't want to die.'
'I cannot die.'
'No. I won't die.'
'Why did I come to a land...ruled by monsters?'
'Opium's grown here.'
'And the man that runs this business is Parmar.'
'He runs this business...'
'...with the help of a politician of this area.'
'Parmar has just one enemy.'
'Shivraj Gurjar.'
'Shivraj Gurjar is more devious than Manik Parmar.'
'There's often bloodshed between the two...'
'...for complete control over the business.'
'Both can stoop to any level for their own interest.'
'And this is why the area has turned into hell.'
'And fate brought me to this hell.'
'That night, Shivraj and Parmar's men...'
'...were trying to kill each other.'
'And in this village of death, I saw my life.'
So. How's yöur boss Ajit Taka.
Ajit Taka's very furious.
He's not ready to increase the rates of yöur opium.
Please explain him.
yöu're an educated man.
yöu see, inflation is on the rise.
If we don't increase rates...
... we can't survive this inflation...
yöu see, they worked for 5000...
...but now, they demand 20,000.
Does that mean yöu'll increase rates 300%?
Calm down, Sawant sir.
If yöu don't understand, who will?
Take a look at this house.
It's hasn't been repainted for two years.
My grandfather built it with great zest.
That is how he looked when he started.
And that's how he ended up when he finished.
Why?
New cars are being launched every day.
I've been driving that...
...same car for the last four years.
Why?
Even I also want to sing, dance, go sight seeing.
Have blast. What else?
What if Ajit Taka refuses?
Brother will sell the stuff himself...
...in international market.
His Rajyoga has started .
Sun and Saturn both are favouring him.
yöu're trying to take a big leap.
yöu can't set foot in the international market, forget selling.
yöu think Taka will let yöu stand.
Taka won't spare yöur life either.
Get that?
Watch it.
What did Shivraj say?
'Maybe I won't do too well in the international market
But, if Taka tries to set foot in Dhartipur...
...then I'll burn him...alive.
Don't mess with me. I'm injurious to health.
What did Parmar say?
He too has grown a bit audacious after Shivraj.
They are such fools.
They grow arrogant with a little power.
A little success makes them...
... forget their real place.
It's difficult to convince them, sir.
But, it's easy to confuse them.
How?
- Do yöu want to know everything?
Sorry, sir. I was only asking.
Get up. It's Shivraj sir's truck.
- Sir.
- Lakha. Don't make any mistake.
Kill everyone in the truck.
And confiscate the goods.
- Yes sir.
I guess he's one of Parmar's men.
Run over him.
It's so late. Why hasn't the truck arrived yet?
Can I say something?
- Yes.
Why are we waiting for the truck?
We're here to plunder the goods, right?
Come on. We'll go take a look.
What happened to the truck?
The goods are missing.
Sir. Someone stole the goods before us.
Have yöu lost yöur mind?
What are yöu saying?
I was shocked too.
Who dared to plunder Shivraj's consignment...
...instead of us?
Don't know, sir.
Find out. Find him.
Otherwise... I will...break yöur limbs.
Bring him to me.
Four! They always bothered the girls.
She's a real hard hitter.
Great, Chanda.
- Let's go.
Brother. yöur planets and stars...
...are in a favorable position.
No one can harm yöu, let alone steal yöur goods.
Boss.
Come on.
It's him.
He stole our goods.
yöu're so short...and yöu look to take a big leap.
Short sizes often achieve big feats.
What did yöu say?
I was talking about this mosquito?
yöu stole our consignment...
...and now yöu're acting smart with us.
I didn't steal it.
I saved it from Parmar.
yöur stuff is safe. It's behind yöur house.
So...what do yöu want?
The idea is yöu let me work for yöu.
I like yöur idea.
Rascal, I...
What's yöur name?
Rajkumar.
Romeo Rajkumar.
Majnu.
See if he's really got something.
There yöu go.
Boss!
He's a ham.
Keep him.
Get lost.
Rascal.
yöu're humiliating us for yöur own good.
Watch what I do to yöu now.
yöu oaf. Don't yöu wear underwear?
Have yöu seen oaf's wearing underwear?
- Shut up!
Sir.
I've heard that Shivraj's coming...
...to inaugurate a bar.
Blow him up.
Crush him like a rodent.
Not me. Him!
- Yes, sir.
Come.
Sir, do we blow him up or crush him like a rodent?
Stop blabbering...
Come.
<font color="#00ff00">♫</font>I'm in love with yöu, God forgive me.<font color="#00ff00">♪</font>
What a girl?
Since I saw her, everything seems beautiful.
yöu too.
It's done.
As soon as his car touches this wire...
...the bomb will explode from both ends.
Can I say something?
- Yes.
He survived the last time.
Why not blow up our own car this time?
They're coming.
The car's here.
Let's go.
Come on. Run! Run!
It's a lucky day for yöu today.
No one can lay a finger on yöu.
Sun God's blessed yöu with His grace.
Boss, Look behind.
The rascal's trying to kill us.
Come here.
yöu...
Where are yöu going?
Look there.
Tell me something.
How did yöu know there's a bomb up ahead?
A bird told me.
That one.
When the cars were moving ahead...
...I noticed that bird...
...sitting four inches above the ground, in mid air.
It rang an alarm.
And at the right time too.
From today yöu're my right hand man.
Like I said, boss.
No one can lay a finger on yöu today.
That bird saved yöu.
Look at the violent flames...
...where the bomb exploded.
I've been working relentlessly for 14 years.
And now, yöu'll be his right hand.
14 years?
That's why yöu're always standing.
yöu never sit.
Boss was right.
yöu're a ham.
Don't hit me.
What?
Why yöu...

Boss. MLA Anandraj is arriving...
...by the morning train to meet Parmar.
Parmar dares to challenge...
...only because of Anandraj and Lakha.
If we shatter his supports...
...he will never stand up again.
Break them.
- Yes, brother...
If the MLA gets down from this side...
...then, I'll kill him.
If he gets down from the other side...
...then, yöu kill him.
Okay?
Hello, Anandraj sir.

Dhauliya, the girls haven't arrived yet.

Hey! Don't be so gentle.
Massage harder.
Come on.
Oh, God!
Not so hard.

yöu took three days to find Lakha's body alone.
And yöu...are just standing there...
...like a coward.
They're powerful people, Parmar sir.
Like yöu.
And yöu know... I'm neither on yöur side...
...nor Shivraj's.
I am just a dog...only looking for bones.
I've an idea.
Make a compromise with Shivraj.
So that he can enjoy killing my men.
And I...stay in mourning and be left alone.
No...
If he doesn't compromise, then kill him.
And if he's ready to compromise...
Still, yöu can kill him.
Fix a meeting.
Parmar. Why call me here?
For a compromise?
yöu killed two of my right hand men.
Yes.
Because yöu tried to kill me.
There's still time.
Join hands with me.
Otherwise, yöu're next on my list.
yöu think I called yöu here for a compromise?
yöu won't leave from here alive.
Get that.
Oh my god.
yöu said he's bringing 60 men.
Just one of my men can deal with them.
Don't be surprised, Mr. Parmar.
yöu paid me.
Sir paid me more.
And I am just a dog.
I can do anything for a bone.
And yöu know that.
I gave the same idea to Shivraj sir as well.
Rascal.
Not yöu.
yöu go.
Rascal...
yöu brought a kid to kill me.
Come on. Come on.
I'll give yöu a piggy back ride.
Parmar!
Be silent...
Or else I'll get violent.
Rascals.
What are yöu all looking at?
Kill him.
Move.
Boss...it's a fantastic time...
Munna. Where are yöu?
I wanted to meet yöu.
yöu can meet Munna at the hospital in half an hour.
Are yöu Munna?
Leave the umbrella. What are yöu staring at?
Beat him!
Well. I'm in yöur arms now.
Now, let's go over that side.
Thank God.
What if he had asked him to feed him?
Listen carefully.
Shake hands...or die.
One more thing.
Don't mess with me.
I am injurious to health.
Hey, fool.
Are yöu going to think with me in yöur arms?
Keep me down.
Move.
It's a deal.
- Its a deal.
Thank yöu.
Sir. They're the Russian Mafia.
If they don't get the marijuana on time...
...it can create a big problem.
And, this Shivraj and Parmar...
...issue is getting worse by the day.
It's difficult to get the stuff from there,
We often face tough times.
So, should I shut down business?
No, sir
Patience, my friend.
Patience.
Come on.
Let's enjoy.
Ladies and Gentlemen, what am I here for?
Pay attention.
Five years ago, I...
Well, according to yöu which one's bigger?
Stupid.
I was asking which is bigger, love or friendship.
Friendship.
- Why?
Love's like an intoxication.
And, yöu need cocaine to stay intoxicated.
But once yöu make a friend...
...he always stands by yöu.
But, how do I taste the intoxication of love?
I don't know where my Lollypop is?
We want to uproot it.
My lollypop.
What happened?
Time to get beaten up again for yöur love.
That's not true.
- Of course it is.
Beat them.
Can I run?
Run Milkha Run!
They're disrupting my meeting.
Burn them all.
Look. Seems like someone's inside.
Is there anyone...
...who can go in and save that man?
Help!
Someone save my old man!
I am inside.
But getting out is going to be a real pain...
Anybody there?
Mister...
I came to save him...
...but, who's going to save me?
I haven't even seen the world yet.
Anybody there?
Anybody there?
Anybody there?
I risked my life to save this dead body.
Water.
Water. Water.
Water.
- Water. Water.
Ice water.
The house is on fire...
...and yöu want ice water.
Water.
I'll get it.
- Quickly.
Here yöu go.
Last time.
Pour the ice water.
Come on. Drink it up.
Hurry up.
Slow motion. Gulp it down.
Now, come on.
No, I won't go outside.
My wife has made my life hell for the last 50 years.
I don't want to go out.
I will die right here.
If yöu want to die, then do it outside.
Go. Go away.
My wife will kill me.
Hail Lord!
Save me.
Look.
Save me.
I don't want to go out.
Look.
Thank yöu very much, son.
Thank yöu very much.
I tried telling yöu so many times.
The house is on fire.
But yöu were drunk.
Wow! There are so many people here...
...but, only yöu showed courage.
yöu're the real hero.
Can I shake hands?
So, hero. See yöu.
Where did he land me?
<font color="#00ff00">♫</font>For the first time, I've noticed love in my beloved's eyes.<font color="#00ff00">♪</font>
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Did yöu see, my lollypop shook my hand?
Who are yöu?
It's me, Rajkumar.
Take a look, yöu fool.
'Wow! There are so many people here...'
'...but, only yöu showed courage.'
'yöu're the real hero.'
'Can I shake hands?'
That means Chanda thanked me...
...without knowing who I am.
Let's go home...
That means, my efforts of saving this old man...
...was wasted.
- What?
Come on.
The house was on fire...
What a boy.
I didn't get a good look at him.
I should've taken his name and number.
Shut up!
He did that only to impress me.
If he can risk his life only to impress yöu...
...then, imagine what he'll do for love.
Look ahead.
Have yöu lost yöur mind?
First yöu let me slap yöu at the restaurant.
Then yöu followed my car.
Jumped in the fire.
And now yöu hurled yöurself in front of my car.
So, yöu noticed everything.
Do yöu know who I am?
yöu're a girl, I am a boy.
What else do we want?
Have yöu seen yöurself in the mirror?
We're not even of the same height.
Yes.
So yöu'll only fall in love with Amitabh Bachchan?
Have yöu seen yöur weight?
Did I say anything?
I'm adjusting too.
Who do yöu think yöu are?
I've proposals from affluent families.
They all want to marry me.
Hey!
I love yöu!
Don't yöu get it?
Affluent boys...
Hey!
If any boy comes anywhere close to yöu...
...I'll break his limbs.
yöu'll only marry me.
Remember that.
Love doesn't depend on height, weight or color.
Love comes from here.
From the heart.
I made a big mistake, sir.
I only stole one packet of opium.
I beg yöu.
Please forgive me.
Boss. It's lunchtime.
Lunch has been served.
- Is it?
I will never...
Shall I stab yöu too? Go and cry there.
The hunger's getting on my mind.
What do yöu think?
What should we do?
Mix the mango pickle with chicken pieces...
...and eat it...it'll taste wonderful.
Hey! I'm talking about Parmar.
It's been two days, he has retorted.
Go. Go and shut him up!
- Yes.
Let's go. Chicken pickle...
Pour some pickle.
The moon's entering in the lower house...
...of yöur horoscope tomorrow.
There's going to be a big change.
We'll just have to arrange a big veneration.
Tomorrow morning is the best time for it.
Should I start making the preparations?
It's nice.
Brother. Only three dips.
yöur life will turn around.
One.
Two.
Three.
It's turned around.
Life's turned around.
It's so heavily guarded.
How will we get in?
yöu bull, stop staring at me.
I doubt his intentions.
Rajkumar, let's go.
We are not cowards.
I've been threatened before.
50 villages support me.
Who does Shivraj think he is?
He's no match for me in this business.
Bloody...
Sorry, sir.
Uncle, yöu called?
Did yöu eat?
- No. I will after I take a bath.
Don't forget to eat.
- Yes.
He's my Lollypop's uncle.
We cannot kill him.
Boss. yöu talk to him.
Stupid oaf.
Hello.
This isn't the right time to kill Parmar.
Come back.
Brother will speak to yöu tomorrow.
Boss has cancelled the plan to kill Parmar.
See.
The power of my love.
Not the electricity again...
What are yöu doing?
I saw yöu without yöur top.
And now, so did yöu.
Now, we're on the same level.
Leave quietly, otherwise...
If yöu say it furiously, I won't go.
Say it with love, and I can even die.
I'll count till 3.
If yöu don't leave, I'll scream.
yöu think I'm joking...
One...
Two...
Look. I'll count till three and scream.
Three...
I knew yöu wouldn't.
Madam.
Madam.
Madam.
Is everything okay?
Everything's fine.
Okay. I'll switch on the generator.
yöu...hate me, don't yöu?
No!
yöu'll come see me tomorrow.
8 am, at the Shiv Temple.
If yöu're late, I'll leave.
The rest is up to yöu.
Shiva. yöu're late.
I've been waiting for yöu at the temple.
Hi.
yöu've been waiting for me for an hour, weren't yöu?
I wasn't waiting for yöu?
- I see.
I came here to apologies...
...for the wrong yöu did yesterday.
From here?
- Yes, here.
Fine. yöu apologies.
And, I'll thank Him. From here.
Lord. I want to thank yöu.
For letting me see a girl...
yöu saw me, didn't yöu?
No need to propagate it.
That trailer was just for yöu.

Its a fantastic phase...
What's everyone doing outside the temple?
What's everyone doing outside the temple?
Come on.
Move. Move.
Wow!
Shivraj.
The mongoose is now in the snake's position.
Fantastic time.
yöu all must be surprised to see us together.
We met yesterday and thought...
Instead of annihilating each other...
...it's better we forget this enmity...
...and, become family.
This deal is for best for both of us.
From today, this village...
...will have two kings, not one.
And then...only happiness.
Only happiness.
Wasn't one enough, that now we have two.
Today, I'm getting my niece Chanda...
...engaged to Shivraj.
Congratulations!
Pandit.
When's the auspicious date?
Sir, Dussera's the best day for the wedding.
Wonderful.
Next month, on Dussera...
...Chanda and Shivraj will get married.
Where's my bride?
- Locked in that room.
I used force, but she isn't agreeing.
Leave this job to me.
I'll go convince her.
Beautiful.
Very beautiful.
If it was business, then I would've used force.
But this about love.
So, I'm thinking from my heart.
Take a good look at me.
yöu won't find a man like me here.
yöu're really fortunate that I like yöu.
I am the king.
Feeling coy.
<font color="#00ff00">♫</font>yöu can't go far from me.<font color="#00ff00">♪</font>
<font color="#00ff00">♫</font>Everywhere yöu go, yöu'll only find me.<font color="#00ff00">♪</font>
Bring the girl here.
Didn't yöu hear?
Bring her here.
Hey. Have yöu gone deaf?
Bring the girl here.
Sir, we'll arrange wedding splendidly.
How did the brother's luck go bad?
Chanda's only mine.
I love Chanda.
What did yöu say, yöu rascal?
yöu mongrel...how could yöu even think like that?
Chanda loves me too.
Rascal. Do yöu know where yöu are...
...and who yöu're talking to?
Curse yöu, yöu swine.
I'll tie yöu up and rape her in front of yöu.
Shivraj!
Be silent.
Or I'll get violent.
There are just two things in my life.
Love. Love. Love.
Or Fight. Fight. Fight.
I can take Chanda away if I want, but I won't.
Because I am a man.
I can do anything for money...
...so just think... What I can do for my love.
The wedding's on Dussera, right?
So, make the preparations.
yöur place.
yöur venue.
But I...will marry Chanda, not yöu.
Stop me if yöu can.
Sir. I found out everything about Romeo.
He hails from Bagalpur.
There are four cases of vandalism against him.
Is yöur information correct?
I hope he doesn't turn out...
...to be an undercover cop.
That rascal has challenged brother.
What do yöu think?
Who is going to win?
Me...or him?
Speak up, who is going to win?
Brother. What's wrong with yöu?
yöu're the king.
And he's just a pauper.
That planetary positions are in yöur favor.
yöur enemies don't stand a chance against yöu.
That boy's no match for yöu.
Yes, boss. yöu will win.
Why didn't yöu speak up earlier?
Because, yöu had a doubt.
And, the entire village has the same doubt.
Even Chanda would have the same doubt.
If I had killed him at the temple...
...then, he would've gained Chanda's sympathy.
But I am a man.
I will marry her on Dussera.
And, after I am done with that worm...
...Chanda, will readily agree to marry me.
Where are yöu go, sweetheart?
Who are yöu?
- She's Bindu.
She'll stay with yöu all the time.
But why?
Because yöu're my future bride.
And if that fool comes here.
I swear on my love, I will kill like a dog.
yöu see, yöu're an exquisite flower.
And, I want to feel yöu gently.
Not crush yöu.
Gentleman.
Same height. Same complexion.
Match made in Heaven!
I wish someone so protective over me...
...no one would've dared to touch me.
This old man looks mischievous.
Stop exposing in front of me.
I guess yöu're busy thinking about me.
I didn't get a chance to miss yöu.
That Shivraj's made my life hell.
Saturn's position...
Brother. Brother.
Chanda and Rajkumar were talking on the phone.
To impress me one has to be a good dancer.
He should know English.
He should be able to read English poetry.
He should wear modern clothes.
Flaunt a style.
If anyone does all this, then...
...I'll be impressed.
Chanda.
Shivraj's going to win yöur heart now.
Brother.
Here's the professor.
He'll teach yöu fantastic English...
...and Chanda will be completely floored.
Good morning, sir.
Sit.
Shall we begin?
A!
yöu dare disrespect me!
I didn't mean any disrespect.
I meant A for Apple.
Professor, he knows all that.
He's studied till class four.
I know that much English.
I only have a problem with speaking.
Bastard.
- What did yöu say?
Bastard means...a big stud.
A man who doesn't spare a single woman.
Then brother's a big bastard.
Professor.
Teach him some English poetry.
He'll take a year.
One month.
One day.
One hour!
Bull shit!
- What?
That's the title of the poem.
Bull shit!
Then tell him yöur bull shit poem.
Yes.

What's this?
This is hip hop break-dance.
Brother do this.
Stop.
This won't do.
yöu know, Prabhu Deva.
Teach me the way he dances.
I will make do with that.
Brother can never do this.
I know what yöu're thinking.
I'm thinking the same.
But, if yöu want to keep dancing, then teach him.
This is a duet.
We'll need a girl.
yöu called.
- She's here. Mischievous girl.
<font color="#00ff00">♫</font>Our friendship gets me high.<font color="#00ff00">♪</font>

yöu're really naughty.
yöu fell on me intentionally.
Stay away from her, brother.
She's hazardous to health.
How did yöu know I was thinking about yöu?
I am angry with yöu.
Only saints get angry.
What's wrong with yöu?
yöu didn't call to wish me.
Wish? Is it yöur birthday?
Only rich people have birthdays.
Then, it must be the day yöu were born?
No. Think harder.
Don't trouble me.
Tell me what is it.
It's so serious matter.
One of yöur men, the bald one.
Has big mustaches.
He's giving me shady looks.
Yes.
What's yöur name?
Say yöur name.
He isn't saying.
yöu talk to him.
Yes. Now continue.
Today is our 10th Golden Jubilee.
Golden Jubilee?
What?
I'm calling yöu after 500 hour 50 minutes and 50 seconds...
...since I saw yöu first.
But, why tell me all this?
I'm already impressed by yöu.
yöu never praise me, Lollypop.
Listen. The plan's going just like yöu said.
That clown's learning English and dancing.
He has a mind and body of an oaf.
We'll drive him insane until Dussera.
Then, I deserve a kiss for the success.
What? Kiss?
yöu can take all yöu want when we meet.
I want it now.
yöu won't listen, will yöu?
Love. Love. Love Or Fight. Fight. Fight.
That's strong.
Love. Love.
Chanda, what's wrong with yöur voice?
yöu swine.
Brother. This title belongs to yöu.
yöu've learned to do the break dance, so now learn cooking as well.
On my wedding, I would love to eat yöur cooking.
Remember, I love chicken stuffed bread.
All the stars were in his favor.
But, he's put his stars in jeopardy.
My arms are bigger than his thighs.
But I've got more brains.
Bindu.
- Yes.
yöur wrong information spoiled everything.
yöu don't worry.
For yöu...I'm a gentleman.
I love yöu.
Good. We'll play.
It's going to be fun.
Lot's of fun.
<font color="#00ff00">♫</font>Love. Love. Love Or Fight. Fight. Fight.<font color="#00ff00">♪</font>
He's drinking at the boss' bar after bothering him.
Beat him to a pulp.
I've brought the most ferocious goons along.
Beat him.
Are yöu Romeo Rajkumar?
- Yes.
Isn't that what yöu were thinking?
Do yöu know what I was thinking?
Look at this.
Don't hit me.
I didn't even lift a finger.
Don't be scared.
Drink it.
I was thinking...violence and bloodshed is useless.
What can I do for Chanda?
Nothing.
But if she marries Shivraj...
...her life will be filled with happiness.
And Chanda's happiness means everything to me.
yöu're so generous.
Kind hearted.
What are yöu doing, Chatur Singh.
yöu shouldn't bow before the yöung ones.
yöu should hug them.
<font color="#00ff00">♫</font>I pray...may yöur life's filled with joy.<font color="#00ff00">♪</font>
I don't want to eat this!
So, don't eat.
What is it?
Rajkumar's sent it.
And said, when I give this Taj Mahal to yöu...
...there will be tears in yöur eyes.
And, I cannot see tears.
He said "Forget him and marry Shivraj".
He's sent this last gift.
Take a look.
Did yöu see?
There he is.
Sir...
Sir, what happened?
Beat him.
Help!
Sir. Why are yöu beating me?
Tell me what I've done.
Look at this.

Come, sir.
Look at this.
That's nice.
Don't hover over them like black clouds.
Let's go.
Bindu.
Let's take a look over there.
- So many saris are there.
Buy me a sari as well.
Allow me.
Are yöu used to wearing a sari?
I'll choose myself.
Who is it? he doesn't work here.
How's this?
Finally...her heart's melting.
Nice.
Can I try it on?
Show me that one.
That one.
Pack that.
What happened? Get changed.
Turn around.
Don't ask me to turn around.
That goes in between the ones who love.
I know what's going to happen...
...if I change when yöu're here.
Come on. Turn around.
Control.
Photo.
Fine, are yöu happy now.
Gents room is that side...
Remove it.
Hey!
Go...and defeat my Rajkumar like a man.
Then come to me.
I'll marry yöu...and even take off the sari.

Uncle.
Few cows are easy to control.
But, some need to taste leather.
If my parents were alive...
...would yöu treat me the same way?
yöur parents aren't alive.
They're dead.
I'm yöur only kin.
yöu will do as I say.
Nothing else.
Nothing else.
yöur parents are dead?
yöu dare be audacious.
Who do yöu think yöu are?
What do yöu think?
It's the question of my honor.
yöu cannot do as yöu please.
Don't yöu dare...
...if I hear yöu speak his name, I'll make yöu pay.
Take that.
The design of the wedding card is fantastic.
Have it distributed in the entire village.
Chanda's marriage will be a grand one.
It's definitely going to be a grand one.
There will be fireworks all around.
And, Romeo will die of jealousy.
It fell here, but the sound's coming from there.
Sir!
Sir.
- Sir where are yöu?
Why did yöu bring me here?
Tell me, why are yöu bring me here.
What did yöu say?
Son, I just asked...why bring me here?
Why are yöu taking off yöur belt?
Why are yöu taking off yöur belt?
I want yöu get beat me, my future uncle-in-law.
Here, hit me.
Son, me?
- Yes. yöu.
yöu are so small in age.
That's not the way.
Well, let me remind yöu.
Papa...
I'm yöur elder.
Here.
Now yöu.
- No.
Take it, papa.
- Yes.
If yöu take another step, I will kill yöu.
I'm here.
Love. Love. Love Or Fight. Fight. Fight.
When I come to marry Chanda...
...if I see a single scratch on her body.
I'll skin yöu alive.
So what if her parents are dead?
I'm there.
I get it.
Let's check there.
yöur dogs have sniffed yöu out.
Be silent...or I'll get violent.
Sir, where were yöu?
We've been looking for yöu...
...for the past three hours.
Don't ask anything.
I've never seen sir so angry before.
Look at how red his eyes are.
It has become red with blood.
I'm scared of looking at him.
Sir is really worried about yöu.
He hit me!
Mother and father.
He hit yöur son!
Here.
- Sir.
Come to meet yöu.
yöu go, I am coming.
Okay fine.
No peacefully does not also cry.
That stupid Rajkumar was threatening me...
'Papa!'
But, I wasn't scared.
And told him clearly...
Chanda will marry only Shivraj.
I was going to strangle him...
...and just then my men arrived.
And he fled.
If they had arrived a little later...
...it would've been all over.
For him!
Didn't I tell yöu?
The stars are strongly in yöur favor...
...and anyone who's under yöur protection...
...can never be harmed.
My prediction can never be wrong.
Then, what's this?
Imposter. "Never be harmed" yöu said.
He flogged me like a donkey.
yöu...
If yöu make any more predictions...
...I will break yöur teeth.
<font color="#00ff00">♫</font>Break yöur teeth,<font color="#00ff00">♪</font>

Even if she gets a scratch.
yöu let it be.
I will handle this.

Romeo.
Are yöu coming to the temple with me tomorrow?
Why the temple?
Are we getting married?
It's the Parvati veneration tomorrow.
If any couple performs this veneration together...
...no one can stop them from...
...leading a happy married life.
Bring a 'Mangalsutra' and a sari, for the offering.
Done, Lollypop.
Meet me at the village square.
We'll go together.
Give me a kiss.
Okay, done.
Come on. It's the Parvati veneration.
We've to go to the temple.
If any couple performs this together...
...no one can stop them from...
...leading a happy married life.
Look. I've also brought a red sari.
Along with a 'Mangalsutra'.
For the offering.
After we get married...
...I'll take yöu to Paris for honeymoon.
And, in a small closed room... I'll take off yöur sari.
And I will mash yöu in such way...
Hug yöu.
I'll kiss yöur lips.
It's going to be so much fun.
Excuse me.
Hello, Romeo.
Lollypop's going to the temple with Shivraj.
We'll pray to the Goddess.
And Shivraj will help yöu Behold the Lord personally.
Here yöu go, talk to Shivraj,
Listen. I've learnt cooking.
yöu love chicken stuffed bread, don't yöu?
That's what I'll treat everyone...
...on yöur mourning.
I've just one motive, to cater to all of yöu.
I'm ready to change parties 100 times...
...only for yöu.
Glory to...
- Kalyan Lokseva
Who threw the shoe?
yöu thief. Shut up!
yöu made big promises the last time as well.
But, yöu didn't do anything.
If yöu cheat us again, then...
See my men, they're also carrying weapons.
They will cut yöu to pieces.
Beat him.
Wait.
Not just them, I've more men coming here in those cars.
They will kill yöu all.
He'll put us in trouble.
What are yöu waiting for? Stop the car.
Beat them.
Sir, Shivraj's coming.
- What Shivraj's car?
Move. Move. Move.
Tell them to move.
- yöur man threw a shoe at me.
Disrupted my gathering.
They're my men. Clear them out.
Brothers, there was a misunderstanding.
Rascal.
- They were not Shivraj's men.
I'm a peace loving man.
Where is she?
Rajkumar.
He took Chanda.

If my parents were alive...
...my name would've been only 'Rajkumar'.
Chanda's my only kin.
And yöurs?
All I have is an uncle.
But, he isn't here.
Hurry up.
If only yöu could receive the blessings of yöur elders...
...it would've been really nice.
The elders are right here.
For us, they are like our children.
Hi!
Where's the rascal?
- Don't fight with each other. Live happily.
yöu're a bit late.
Romeo was here.
We finished praying as well.
Don't worry.
We've given her our blessings.
They will live happily ever after.
Romeo brought me here, but how will I go back?
Will yöu take me back home, won't yöu?
Life was supposed to spin clockwise...
...how did it spin the other way round?
Come on.
Go on.
Love Or Fight.
Romeo said he'll take me to Bangkok for our honeymoon.
And in the honeymoon suite...
...he'll take my sari off himself.
And then he'll pinch me.
And give me a tight hug.
And kiss my lips.
yöu can do anything yöu like before the marriage.
24 hours.
24 hours is all he has.
After that yöu will be mine.
And I'll take my revenge.
Get lost.

I've arrested Romeo.
Come to the police station right now.
And kill him personally.
Now yöu will know...the power of police.
Neither the Prime Minister...
...nor the President can kill anyone.
Only the police have a license to kill.
Get that.
Hello.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay, sir.
Okay.
I'm not arrest yöu, if yöu tell me before.
I am sorry, forgive me.
Suits yöu better.
Me...
How are yöu, Bullet?
- Ready to fire.
It's all about time.
When time changes...
...even the weak can severe a harsh blow.
Cowards like Shivaj and Parmar...
...tell me that I can't set foot here.
But, I just kept my entire palm.
That Romeo works for Ajit Taka.
He's come here to kill yöu two.
He's here to seize the entire area.
To take charge of yöur opium.
Well done, Romeo.
When are yöu making the delivery?
I've the opium.
Whenever yöu want, I'll make the delivery.
The stuff's all here.
Then why did he talk about stealing?
To confuse yöu, fool.
He wanted to find out where's the stuff.
Shift the entire goods.
Shivraj's entire consignment.
I'm not impressed, because I knew...
...this job's easy for yöu.
Sir.
The truck's empty.
yöu're my brightest man.
Yet, Shivraj deceived yöu.
Do yöu know why?
Woman!
When I was 18... I fell in love with a girl.
I would cycle for 16 kilometers...
...under the hot sun, for a single glimpse of her.
Business and love don't go hand-in-hand.
Business love.
Business love.
I couldn't concentrate on work.
So I stopped thinking from here.
And started thinking from here.
I killed her.
Look where I am...
Kill her too.
yöu'll be successful.
Isn't it
Didn't like it?
yöur problem is love.
My problem is losing.
I can do anything to win.
Love made yöu useless.
Otherwise, yöu were a useful man.
Taka wanted opium.
And I wanted Chanda.
I'm win.
And yöu lost.
People like us can turn our enmity into friendship...
Cheap man like yöu can never understand.
No!
Wait.
Say it.
Who won?
Speak up.
Who won?
- yöu won.
yöu won.
Go.
Get in the car.
It's too sunny.
No!
No!
I'm going.
I'm going.
I'm going.
Take him away. Bury him.
Congratulations for the new friendship, Shivraj.
yöu too.
yöu got the girl, and I get the Opium.
When are yöu getting married?
Tonight.
Chanda's only mine.
By killing Rajkumar...
...I've proved to everyone who I am.
Tonight, I'll prove to yöu.
Bindu.
- Yes.
Get Chanda ready and bring her out.
