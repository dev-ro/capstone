Ten o'clock! Closing up!
Gentlemen, please!
Just wait a bit for Valuska
to show us.
Leave it out!
Valuska. Come on.
Show us.
Let's make some room for Valuska
to show us!
You are the Sun.
The Sun doesn't move.
This is what it does.
You are the Earth.
The Earth is here for a start
and then the Earth moves
around the Sun.
And now...
we'll have an explanation
that simple folks like us
can also understand
about immortality.
All I ask is that you step with me
into the boundlessness
where constancy,
quietude
and peace,
infinite emptiness reign.
And just imagine that
in this infinite sonorous silence
everywhere
is an impenetrable darkness.
Here we only experience
general motion
and at first we don't notice
the events we are witnessing.
The brilliant light of the Sun
always sheds its heat and light
on that side of the Earth
which is just then turned towards it.
And we stand here
in its brilliance.
This is the Moon.
The Moon revolves around the Earth.
What is happening?
We suddenly see
that the disc of the Moon,
the disc of the Moon...
on the Sun's flaming sphere
makes an indentation
and this indentation,
the dark shadow, grows bigger...
and bigger.
And as it covers more and more,
slowly, only a narrow crescent
of the Sun remains,
a dazzling crescent.
And at the next moment...
the next moment, say that
it's around one in the afternoon,
a most dramatic
turn of events occurs.
At that moment...
the air suddenly turns cold.
Can you feel it?
The sky darkens
and then goes all dark.
The dogs howl,
rabbits hunch down,
the deer run in panic,
run, stampede in fright.
And in this awful,
incomprehensible dusk
even the birds...
the birds too are confused
and go to roost.
And then... complete silence.
Everything that lives is still.
Are the hills going to march off?
Will Heaven fall upon us?
Will the Earth open under us?
We don't know.
We don't know,
for a total eclipse has come upon us.
But...
but no need to fear, it's not over.
For across the Sun's glowing sphere
slowly the Moon swims away.
And the Sun once again bursts forth
and to the Earth slowly
there comes light again,
and warmth again floods the Earth.
Deep emotion pierces everyone.
They have escaped
the weight of darkness.
That's enough! Out of here,
you tubs of beer!
But Mr Hagelmayer,
it's still not over.
Mr Eszter!
Mr Eszter!
Uncle Gyuri come on.
You're getting cold.
Please come.
Your socks too.
Sleep well.
FANTASTIC:
THE WORLD'S LARGEST GIANT WHALE!
AND OTHER WONDERS OF NATURE!
GUEST STAR: THE PRINCE
Good evening.
Good evening Uncle Béla.
You're late today, János.
How's János?
How are things in the cosmos?
Everything is fine.
Thanks.
Family tragedies
come in succession.
One just after the other.
Now. If a family takes hold
of itself. They simply disappear.
And nobody knows anything about it.
Now don't tell me that this is
normal. A normal proceedirng.
The world has gone completely mad.
Now it's not down here but up there
where something's gone wrong.
For in November
the Radio says that it's 17 below.
There's a shortage of coal
and then to top it all.
There's the arrival of the circus.
They're bringing that horrible
great whale, and that Prince.
All of ten kilos.
They say he's carried in their arms,
has to be.
And for that matter,
he's got three eyes.
I don't know if that's true or not.
They say that he's taken
from town to town
and makes that godless,
monstrous speech.
Nobody knows for sure
Even those who were there
don't understand it!
They say that
in the market square of Sarkad,
when they were bringing
the Prince around,
the clock of the church
began to go, just like that.
The clock that had stopped years ago,
and there it started all over again.
And the poplar tree fell.
A great crack
and out came its roots
from the concrete.
No wonder people are afraid.
There isn't anyone who dares
leave the house after dark.
They're afraid of being attacked,
burgled, robbed.
Plundered, stabbed, raped.
You have to keep a dog.
The mind just boggles.
You have to have a dog
for these rascals.
But once again
nothing is sacred.
They went and pulled down
the statues in the Góndócs Gardens.
They stole the headstones
from the graveyard.
So how can you explain
all this in normal terms?
The mysterious unknown plagues
are here.
Great frozen mountains of refuse
are everywhere.
People bolt the door and tremble,
dreading what is to come.
It's certain that
something is to come.
How's our János?
Good morning Uncle Karcsi.
- Have you seen them?
- No. Who?
You don't know anything?
- No.
- Listen.
Apparently,
they came on the evening train
yesterday.
Because of the whale.
Well, you can never know.
You can never know
anything for sure.
Some say there's at least
three hundred of them,
someone else
that there's only two of them
actually,
and that the whole attraction
is the most frightening thing
that you would ever see.
It's also said that the whole thing
is just a cover-up for other things.
That when night comes,
they'll swoop down
on the peaceful inhabitants.
They also say...
the whale's got no part in it.
Then the next moment,
that the whale
is the cause of it all.
What's sure is that
they're already looting.
They broke the windows
of the clothing shop.
The stoker saw that
with his own eyes.
If I go that way,
I'll take a look.
Goodbye.
I have to make it clear
that not even for a moment
is there a doubt that
it is not a technical
but a philosophical question.
So that the tonal system in question,
through research,
has led us inevitably
to a test of faith,
in which we ask:
On what do we base our belief
that this harmony,
the core of every masterpiece,
referring to its own irrevocability,
actually exists or not?
From this it follows
that we should speak of,
not research into music,
but a unique realisation
of non-music
which for centuries
has been covered up
and a dreadful scandal
which we should disclose.
Hence the shameful situation
that all the intervals
in the masterpieces of many centuries
are false.
Which means
that music
and its harmony and echo,
its unsurpassable enchantment
is entirely based
on a false foundation.
Yes, we have to speak
of an indisputable deception,
even if those who are less sure,
a little moderate,
babble on about compromise.
But what kind of compromise,
when for the majority
pure musical tonality
is simply illusion,
and truly pure
musical intervals do not exist?
Here we have to acknowledge
the fact
that there were ages more
fortunate than ours,
those of Pythagoras
and Aristoxenes,
when our forefathers
were satisfied with the fact
that their purely tuned
instruments
were played in only some tones,
because they were not troubled
by doubts,
for they knew that heavenly harmonies
were the province of the gods.
Later, all this was not enough.
Unhinged arrogance
wished to take possession
of all the harmonies
of the gods.
And it was done in its own way.
Technicians were charged
with the solution,
a Praetorius, a Salinas,
and finally an Andreas Werckmeister,
who resolved the difficulty
by dividing the octave of the harmony
of the gods, the twelve half-tones,
into twelve equal parts.
Of two semi-tones, he falsified one.
Instead of ten black keys,
five were used
and that sealed the position.
We have to turn our backs on this
development of tuning instruments,
the so-called constant-tempered
and its sad history
and bring back
the naturally tuned instrument.
Carefully, we have to correct
Werckmeister's mistakes.
We have to concern ourselves
with these seven notes of the scale
but not as of the octave,
but
seven
distinct and independent qualities
like seven fraternal stars
in the heavens.
What we have to do then,
if we are aware,
is that this natural tuning
has its limits,
and it is a somewhat worrisome limit
that definitely excludes
the use of certain
higher signatures.
- How much?
- A hundred forints.
Thanks.
Tell me, what's in there?
People are chattering
about some Prince.
Certainly not, Mr Árgyelán.
A giant whale has arrived.
This mysterious creature from the sea
has come from the far-off oceans.
Most definitely
you have to see it too.
I don't like this at all, János.
Nothing wrong with it,
Mr Árgyelán.
Just see what a gigantic animal...
...the Lord can create!
How mysterious is the Lord
that he amuses Himself
with such strange creatures.
It'll lead to trouble, János.
How's János?
Good morning Uncle Lajos.
Good morning Auntie Tünde.
How's János?
I've come about very important
and serious business.
It's about my former husband.
I know that you are close to him,
that you are devoted to him.
I've done everything too for him.
No, I never ever wished him harm.
I made the greatest sacrifice
for him:
I moved out.
At his request.
So he can devote himself to his art.
By doing this
I gave up the position
due to me in the town.
Now it is his turn.
Now he has to make a sacrifice.
That's easy to understand.
You do understand, János?
So with the police chief
and some more people of good will
we are establishing a movement
which will restore order,
create cleanliness
and we are procuring
the necessary funds.
You can see that a movement
like this needs a chairman,
a strong individual, who...
has influence over others,
who is persuasive.
And he,
he is such a personality.
Yes, and now two possibilities
offer themselves.
One is that he accepts
the chairmanship
and everything remains as it was.
The second is that he says no
and then...
Yes. And then
I'll have to move back in with him,
and...
to convince him
of my serious intention,
I'm sending my suitcase ahead of me.
All my things are in it.
Everything has been prepared.
Here is the list.
On it are all the people
of good will and standing
in the town.
He should seek them out
and win them round to the cause.
Just a few signatures,
and then he can sit back again
at his piano
and strum away.
Auntie Tünde, I...
I know that...
The fact is...
Uncle Gyuri isn't very well and...
I'd like to lie down
for a while myself,
because I worked all night
and I think that he won't be able
to take this on.
- But...
- So please don't be annoyed.
You have to understand that
there's no time to put this off.
If he doesn't collect
all the signatures
by 4 this afternoon at the latest,
then...
I'll move back in with him, no matter
how difficult it will be for me.
It's impossible
in that wretched hovel I live in
to organise all this.
Do you understand?
I see, but...
This is the time that
Uncle Gyuri likes to work and I...
Now wouldn't be a good time
for me to go to him, because...
you see,
I'm very tired.
But yes, he'll succeed,
so go and talk to him at home.
Just say that
what I'm waiting for him to do
is to show an example,
to come forward with money
for this movement.
And add to that, if he doesn't,
then
I'll be having supper with him
this very evening.
- Hello Lajos.
- Good morning Ma'am.
Good morning.
How's it going?
LAJOS HARRER JR.
BOOT AND SHOEMAKER
Good morning Aunt Harrer.
How's János? So you're here.
That I am.
What's happening outside?
What did you see on your way here?
- Will I be able to get home?
- Of course, you will.
There's talk that they're breaking
shop windows
and set fire to the hotel.
And the butcher got his head
cracked open.
No wonder an honest person doesn't
dare go out in the street.
Don't be afraid, Aunt Harrer.
Just be calm.
You can go home without any worry.
Being careful never hurt anybody.
I said not to get excited.
There's no problem.
You can go home easily.
On this perfectly tuned instrument
you yourself can hear
how grating is the E flat prelude
from the Wohltemperierties Klavier.
This is for you
from Auntie Tünde.
She asks you to get dressed
in your warm clothes
because it's very cold outside -
and to set off to find
these people and persuade them
to join the Clean Town Movement,
and you'll be chairman.
Because she and the Chief of Police
would like to restore order
in the town and because
the people won't say no to you.
She also says that
if you do not feel like doing that,
then she'll have supper here today,
"this very evening".
That's why she sends this case
with her clothes,
so that she won't have to carry it.
We're not going anywhere.
Neither now, nor later.
But...
Auntie Tünde says
you should do everything
- by 4 this afternoon...
- János, just don't worry...
There will be no trouble.
We haven't yet
and we won't move from here.
Especially not for this stupid
slattern and her petty-minded
and evil command.
Aunt Tünde also says that
if you take on the chairmanship,
everything will remain as it was.
We're not going to do anything.
We're not going to make
the same mistake twice.
I'll be coming with you, see.
It's no big thing, Uncle Gyuri.
We'd better start.
We'll be late for four o'clock.
Aunt Tünde
doesn't mean you any harm.
See, we'll go there, arrange it all
in a couple of hours and come back.
And then she wouldn't come back here,
this evening or any other time...
Believe me Uncle Gyuri,
Auntie Tünde is very determined.
So this is serious, you think?
Yes.
Let's suppose I comply,
will you take the case back then?
Yes.
I'm finished for now, Mr Eszter.
Thank you Mrs Harrer.
Your money is on the writing table.
Thank you. I'll be here
at the usual time on Friday.
A little fresh air won't hurt you.
Goodbye.
János, would you be so kind
as to get that out of here?
Go and find
the furthest point in the house
and put it there.
Right away.
Come on then, Uncle Gyuri.
So if we're going like this,
I can fetch your lunch.
I knew she wouldn't give up,
she couldn't stand it
and that she'd be in contact
sometime.
For a moment of madness,
what a price to pay.
It's all the same in the end.
I've paid for it and I may pay
for it all my life.
I'll split the slut's skull
"this very evernirng".
Uncle Gyuri, let's go
towards the market square
and then you can see for yourself
the giant whale,
as long as twenty metres
and you can see into its throat,
and it really stinks.
And all a man can do
is look upon it
and see how great is the Lord's
creative impulse
and power, and how omnipotence
is reflected in that animal.
That's what has to be looked at,
must be seen, Uncle Gyuri.
First let's finish
with this damned list.
- Good afternoon Mr Eszter, János.
- It's you I was looking for.
Good afternoon Mr Eszter.
- Something has to be done.
- We can't count on the power supply,
the school and the town hall
are closed.
Because of the shortage of coal,
the problems of heating homes
have taken on terrible dimensions...
There are no medicines,
travelling by bus or car is finished.
The telephones have gone dead.
There's no street lighting...
And to top it all
here comes this circus
with this horrendous whale
and Prince!
With blasphemous words
inciting people to riot!
When we don't know if the world's
coming to an end by tomorrow!
And to allow in that motley nightmare
with that stinking monster,
when the town itself is under threat?
Who can think of amusement
in this chaos?
I'd like to draw your attention
to the need for solidarity.
Common sense is the most important...
We can't look on passively while
catastrophe swoops down on us...
Children and mothers are in tears...
The Earth is in dire peril!
A moment, gentlemen.
Uncle Gyuri, take it easy.
Not now...
From your despondent words,
the situation must be serious,
and in the interest of restoring
order we have to take action.
So Uncle Gyuri, I'll run off and get
your lunch before the kitchen closes.
Off you go.
Now then, gentlemen,
Here is...
Here is this list.
Now then, let's go through it,
before
every one of us lose our heads,
and try to rise above
the threat hanging over us.
Good afternoon!
- How's our János?
- Good afternoon.
You're late, János.
We want to get off home.
Good afternoon.
Right.
- Here you are. Take care...
- Thank you.
- Good bye, Uncle Karcsi.
- Bye bye, János.
What's going to happen to the whale?
My friend,
it'll be four o'clock in a minute.
The most important thing
you can do is go to her
and tell her that I've done
what she asked.
- But...
- It would have been good
to meet this excellent being
to scrutinise him - a point
on the evolutionary scale
where I would have happily stopped.
A meeting both pleasurable
and entertaining.
But...
this walk has exhausted me,
and
a meeting with this whale of yours
may well be, I think,
just as captivating tomorrow.
Goodbye.
All the best to you. Bye!.
