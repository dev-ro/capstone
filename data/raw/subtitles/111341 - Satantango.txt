- Doctor!
- What do you want?
- Doctor!
- What are you doing here?
Let me go.
Stupid brat!
Fucking hell!
What the hell do you want?
Come on, tell me.
What do you want?
Where are you going?
Stop!
I won't do you any harm.
Yes, she said to herself softly.
The angels see this and understand.
She felt peaceful inside and
the trees, the road, the rain
and the night all radiated peace.
Everything that happens
is good, she thought.
Everything was becoming simple in the end.
She recalled the events of the previous day
and she smiled as she realized
how things connect together.
She felt that those events
aren't connected by accident,
but there's an unspeakable and
beautiful meaning linking them.
And she knew she wasn't alone, for
all things and people, her father upstairs,
her mother, her brothers, the doctor,
the cat, the acacias,
this muddy road, the sky,
the night down here depend on her.
Just as she herself depends on everything.
She had no reason to be worried.
She knew that her angels
had already set out for her.
SPIDER JOB II
(The devil's nipples, satantango)
I was plodding and plodding,
just plodding along.
The Steigerwald kids and Hochan,
the butcher, the girls,
as they jumped like grasshoppers
when Irimias hugged me
and asked "How's it going, Kelemen?"
And bought a round and told me everything
and they were drinking rum and brandy.
Even then I was plodding and plodding
and plodding and plodding along.
They'll be here!
They'll be here at the farm!
They'll be here. The Toth kid...
Irimias and Petrina...
and they've been at the Steigerwalds...
And as I was plodding along,
when it became clear
they were leaving for the farm,
then I knew enerything.
Irimias and Petrina are coming
toward the farm.
I met Hochan, the butcher
and I bumped into the Toth kid...
And as I was plodding along...
for I had to plod,
I saw them by the road,
revelation...
which way... why... where to...
and the plodding, the why,
the where to and the which way,
the Toth kid, the Steigerwald kids...
Irimias and Petrina
and the gunpowder at the Steigerwalds'...
And the Steigerwald kids talking
of gunpowder, and me plodding...
And the Steigerwald kids
were talking of gunpowder...
...And the Steigerwald kids...
were talking of gunpowder...
But the Toth kid... he was there...
at the silo.
- Put some soda in it.
- I've already put some in.
...And the Steigerwald kids...
- A bottle of wine!
...Gunpowder's not gun-powder.
They were talking about gunpowder.
- Careful or it goes to your head.
- ...No gun-powder, gunpowder.
I was plodding, plodding along...
Gunpowder's not gun-powder!
Gunpowder! It's no gun-powder!
He hugged me... The waitresses
jumped like grasshoppers...
They were drinking rum and brandy...
I know I shouldn't have any more
for it all goes to my head.
You're offering it so invitingly.
Just goes straight to your head!
You're pissed to your eyeballs.
...As you plod along you learn everything...
Don't fucking give her another!
Can't you see the state of her!
I shouldn't drink.
When I do I keep thinking of coffins.
...the Steigerwalds and Irimias hugged me,
the girls jumped like grasshoppers,
and bought a round,
drinking rum and brandy...
and he told me everything
and I'm plodding, plodding...
plodding, plodding, and plodding along...
but there's a huge difference
between plodding and plodding.
I knew exactly when I saw
them at the junction,
why, how which way, why and how...
I'm plodding, plodding...
and how am I plodding?
How am I plodding?
The gunpowder, the Steigerwalds,
the Toth kid...
The whole street was talking about
them hiding gunpowder.
Why did they do that? Why are they coming
Toward the farm? I know... I had a revelation...
This heat is unbearable!
Janos, please do something!
You don't begrudge the coal from her?
...He's coming at the road
junction. I know exactly why.
Why, why and why they're coming
and why they're coming. And I'm plodding...
- It's nice and warm in here...
- You let him, dickhead?
What's the matter with you? At least,
there's something good left for the others.
...For I was plodding and
plodding and plodding along...
- This is no whore-house.
- What is it then?
...They have stopped, but they're coming!
Let's go to the mill.
...They'll be here in no time!
Where the hell are you going?
- Nowhere, honey-pot, nowhere.
- Don't you honey-pot me...
...just get sober by tomorrow morning.
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.
...They're coming!
I saw them on the road...
Give me a shot.
...And they're coming... Irimias and Petrina
are coming toward the farm.
Gunpowder, Steigerwald...
They're coming toward the farm!
...Yeah, they're coming! It's only a matter
of minutes! We were plodding along...
My man is a good man...
but it's the liqueur, you know...
if it wasn't for that, he'd be so gentle...
He can be a blessed good man if he wants to.
He's a hard worker. You know that.
He can do the work of two.
Only that little failing that he has.
Who doesn't have one? Who?
Someone's coming!
I was plodding, plodding, plodding along.
They didn't say much.
Irimias and Petrina...
Good evening.
A bottle of beer, please.
...The girls bounced around like grasshoppers.
Irimias hugged me...
Wow! Hell is burning hot!
...The girls jumped around
like grasshoppers...
And I was plodding, plodding
and plodding along...
Have you seen my daughter?
- Which one?
- The little one. Estike.
She hasn't been here.
...When they started toward the farm
at the junction, I knew everything.
Irimias and Petrina are
coming toward the farm.
I met Hochan, the butcher and bumped
into the Toth kid at the silo...
You know what happened?
A little trouble with Halics.
Now he doesn't even say
"Hello", the shithead.
...Revelation...
Which way, why, where to...
and the plodding, the why and
the where to, the which way...
I slept all day. I wake up
tonight: No one anywhere.
The house is empty.
No Mari, no Juli, no Sanyika.
...And plodding, plodding and plodding...
The Steigerwald kids were
talking about gunpowder...
But that doesn't matter. It's the little one
who wandered away somewhere.
- If she turns up, I'll beat her up.
- Of course, she'll turn up.
She's not the wandering type.
Certainly not.
...the gunpowder's no gun-powder...
I wandered in this rain all night long.
No wonder I have to stick to bed for days.
...The waitresses jumped like grasshoppers.
They were drinking rum and brandy...
That's good for my stomach.
Wouldn't you like some coffee?
No, it would make me toss and turn all night.
Then what is it good for?
Nothing.
...In a little while... I was
plodding and plodding...
The Toth kid, the Steigerwalds...
and Irimias hugged me...
The girls jumped like grasshoppers...
he bought us a round,
they had rum and brandy.
He told me everything.
And I keep plodding...
Well, good night.
If you happen to see them,
tell them to hit the road home.
I can't loiter here all night.
Here's the bill.
...why, how, which way, why and how...
Plodding and plodding and plodding.
And how am I plodding?
The gunpowder, Hochan,
the butcher, Steigerwald, Toth...
Everybody was talking about
the Steigerwald kids hiding gunpowder.
Why?
And why are Irimias and Petrina
coming toward the farm?
I know why they're coming.
Because I had a revelation. A revelation.
I know why they're coming.
Because I had a revelation.
They're coming at the junction.
I know exactly why.
They have stopped, yet they're coming.
Futaki, you stupid ass,
You roll in the mud like a pig, then
you go out in the rain like a lost sheep.
Are you out of your mind?
Don't you know you're not supposed
to get pissed in here?
And without eating, too.
Wash your face. Dry yourself.
Do you have anything to grub?
Milk chocolate...
or cheese rolls.
Give me two cheese rolls.
Bloody hell!
What can't be removed, they soil
and foul, everything.
I could spend my whole life
following them with a cloth.
The legs of the table, the
window, the stove... the crates.
The worst is that you can't see them do it.
If I start to watch them,
they can feel it
and they vanish.
That damn Swabian
did me in,
he never talked about spiders.
Nothing will come out of this.
No.
The real threat comes from under the ground.
Suddenly one's frightened by the silence
He doesn't move, crouches down
in the corner where he feels safe.
Chewing becomes pain, swallowing agony.
Then all slows down and finally...
comes the most terrible thing,
a standstill.
There's no way out.
Who can understand?
I could live till the end of time,
but I have to bolt from here down
to that stinking hell of dark mud...
- But there's Irimias coming...
- Irimias?
He's been drinking on the house for a fortnight
and he has the bloody nerve to come back here.
Because, okay, he said, plant onions
everywhere. And it worked.
Great ideas are always simple.
But it's a bit too much that afterwards
he says I owe him everything!
And for a fortnight he's been boozing free!
And he has the nerve to come back to take
what's mine! Everything here is mine!
I have done everything here.
Do they think they can do whatever they like?
They come in from the street
and say it all amounts to the same...
There will be law and order
in this country, my good friend!
There will be order here one day!
You see, that's Halics!
May I have a tango?
Dancing is my weakness.
You're not like the others.
You need a settled, sober man,
not a Schmidt,
whose roughness doesn't suit
your pure tenderness.
Listen,
if those most excellent people
can occupy again the positions
they deserve again,
and I am headmaster again,
I would take you to the city...
Tango is my life. Tango, tango, tango...
My mother's the sea...
My father's the earth,
my name is tango... tango... tango...
My father's the sea...
is my life...
the tango...
My father's the sea,
My mother's the earth...
Never mind.
Is my life... Tango...
Tango... tango...
...is my life!
The tango...
My mother's the sea
and my father's the earth...
No sea, no earth either...
Fuck you.
What have you done to the sea, to the earth?
My life is
Tango...
Tango, tango...
My mother's the sea,
That was it.
And to the sweet sound of an accordion,
the pub spiders launched their last attack.
They wove loose webs on top of the
glasses, the cups, the ashtrays,
around the legs of the tables and the chairs.
Then they bound them together
with secret threads,
as if it was crucial that
from their hidden corners,
they should notice every little move
and every little stir,
as long as this almost invisible
perfect web was not damaged.
They wove webs around the sleepers
faces, their feet, their hands.
Then hurried back to their hiding-place,
waiting for one of their ethereal threads
to quiver to start it all over again.
PAUSE
