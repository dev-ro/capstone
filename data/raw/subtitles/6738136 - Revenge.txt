You drive me completely crazy.

[couple talking on the TV]
[sighs]
[sighs] Everything would be so
simple if the kids weren't there.
[sighs]
And if you didn't have
such a nice ass.
Where is that little
peachy ass of mine?
[giggling]
Little juicy, peachy ass.
[giggling]
It's like a little alien
coming from another planet.

Richard!
[sighs] What the fuck?
[door sliding]
[sighs]
Oh, hum, Jennifer?
Just a friend.
She, uh...
She came for two days before...
Anyway...
Stan, Dimitri, my associates.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi...
I'll leave you guys to it.
I'm gonna go take a shower.

[glass clinking]
[distant laughter]
As soon as I can,
I'll fly far away.
Tell me where.
I'll book my plane
ticket right now.
[laughter]
To L.A.
Everything is possible there.
Everything goes faster.
And... you can be noticed in no time.
[phone vibrating]
And be noticed as what?
I don't know.
Just to be noticed?
You'd have to be blind
not to notice you.
- Fuck. Leave it.
- What is it?
Peyote.
A local, highly powerful
hallucinogenic. This shit
could flatten a football team.
It's for me!
- For tonight!
- Hey.
This, plus weapons, is a guaranteed
accident, you fucking morons.
A few years ago, a Polish guy
got so high on this shit,
he sawed his own leg off
without feeling a damn thing.
He died without a drop
of blood in his body.
[whistles]
Here you go, beautiful. Could you
go and hide it somewhere safe?
[dance music]
Uh-oh, here comes trouble.
[catcalls]
[catcalls]
Oh, yeah!
No, no no no. No.
Wow.
[door closing]
Hey! There she is.
Oopsie, hang on a sec.
There we go.
[dragging]
Oh. Richard went to give our
passports to the gamekeeper.
It'll take him all morning.
Oh.
And Dimitri
is nursing a hangover.
Which will also take all morning.
[awkward laugh]
So.
It's just the two of us.
[tense music]
- I'm gonna start packing.
- Oh.
If I want to be
ready on time.
[dramatic music]
Oh, sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.
Oh, no, it's OK, you
just surprised me, that's all.
Hey, this is a nice bedroom.
Yes, it is.
[nervous chuckle]
You know, it really is a shame
we didn't have more time to get
to know each other better.
Call me when you can.
We could do...
a thing or two...
together.
I don't know
if I'll have time with work.
Oh, work.
[laughs]
[clears throat] So now
you're a fucking politician.
[short laugh]
What is it
you don't like about me?
No, nothing.
I just want to know, so...
tell me.
What is it
you don't like about me?
You're... You're not
my type, that's all.
Oh.
Why am I not your type?
You're...
you're too small.
Oh.
I like taller guys,
that's all.
There we go! [laughter]
[sighs]
And I haven't changed height
since yesterday, have I?
I asked you a simple question.
Even for your tiny
little oyster brain,
it shouldn't be
too difficult to understand.
So, I'll ask you again.
Did my height
change
since yesterday?
No.
And yet,
you seemed to like me yesterday.
No, but I...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. When we were
dancing together last night,
everything was very clear.
You came onto me
like a pussy in heat,
rubbing yourself against me,
turning me on.
And now, suddenly,
I'm not your type?
Like that, boom.
During the night,
I've become too small for you.
[slam]
Yesterday,
you were dying for it.
And now you're apparently...
Stop.
Richard will
be back anytime soon.
[mocking] Oh, Richard.

Hey.
Call the helicopter.
Call the helicopter.
I want to go home.
Hey, calm down,
calm down.
I'll take care
of everything, OK?
Don't worry.
[door slams]
How long did I sleep for?
- Has the helicopter arrived yet?
- Shh...
Everything's OK.
I fixed everything.
I made a few phone calls
to find you a job.
In Canada.
It's practically Los Angeles.
That's the amount I transferred
to an account for you,
you can use it
as you please.
Jen, this is the possibility
to change your life,
to fulfill your dreams.
I want to go home right now.
Call that fucking helicopter.
Baby, baby, baby...
Don't act like a child.
You know that's not possible.
If you love me,
think about me.
OK, they fucked up big time,
but you're so damn beautiful,
it's hard to resist you.
Come on. Jen,
they'll come and apologize
and we'll forget
about the whole thing.
You call
the goddamn helicopter!
Or I'll call your wife
and tell her everything!
Who the fuck
do you think you are?
You little whore.
You dare threaten me or
fuck things up in my life?
Don't you ever talk
about my wife.
Don't you ever say her name.
[crying]
[dramatic music]
Hey, stop! Stop! Stop!
Jen, look at me.
I'm sorry about the slap.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
It's just... stress.
I lashed out
without thinking.
Give me your phone.
Give me the fucking phone!
I'm calling the chopper, I don't
want to hear another word about it.
What a fucking mess.
Hey Roberto, it's Richard.
How are you?
I'm very good, thank you. Listen,
we planned a pick-up at 2:30pm.
Yeah. And I would like
to make it earlier.
Yeah, as soon as possible.
Perfect.
OK, thanks.
He'll be there in 30 minutes.
OK?
