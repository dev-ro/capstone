Bull bosh!
Whimpering excuses, incompetent crap!
Wait a minute. Don't print that.
Incompetent crap.
That's all I ever get
from that one lousy county.
I've had to eat so much crow,
the conservationists are claiming
the species is practically extinct.
Governor, from the standpoint
of public relations...
You'll make me look like the same jackass
I've looked like for three years.
Y'all have been here watching
these press conferences.
What do they ask me about?
Dunston County.
I get my picture on the cover
of "Time" magazine
and what's half the damn story about?
Dunston County.
Next I'll be on national TV, and
delegates and people over the country,
what are they gonna be thinking about?
Nomination?
No way. They'll say that's
that dumb cracker who can't clean up...
- Sir.
- What do you want?
Governor, I...
- What do you want, Bruster?
- Bridger.
Bridger, yes.
Sir, I have a man outside who may have
the key to Dunston County.
He's on loan to us from the US Justice
Department, New York.
One of the top men in their strike force,
his name is Irving Greenfield.
- Wait. Did you say New York?
- Yes, sir.
Bridger, come here.
New York?
Irving Greenfield?
Jew?
Why?
He's the man who broke
the Joey Gallo case, sir.
Why didn't you say so? Don't keep him
waiting. Go out there and get him.
Do you believe it? Do you believe that?
Way up there in New York City, the US
Justice Department worrying about me,
poor little southern governor,
who can't seem to solve his problems.
So, in New York, they've nothing to worry
about but this southern governor.
What do they send me from New York?
They send me down a New York...
- Come in, Mr Greenberg.
- Greenfield.
- Fine. How are you?
- Fine. I've been waiting weeks to see you.
It's wonderful to have you. New York City?
New York is a fine city. Fine state.
The Big Apple.
Been there many times myself.
Saw "Fiddler On The R"oo"f" three times.
Tell the governor, Mr Greenfield.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Governor, the Justice Department
has run a check
and we found out that the whole
of Dunston is run by one man.
- Bama McCall. Yes, we knew about that.
- Bama McCall...
Then you're probably aware he grew up
with this moonshiner Gator McKlusky.
No, we werert aware of that.
No, I didn't think you were.
It seems McKlusky's just been released
after serving 26 months in the state prison.
- It was a second offence.
- Go on.
Well, I want to bust him,
put him in with McCall,
and if McKlusky cooperates,
we'll have enough evidence to prosecute.
Well, now, why would
this Gator McKlusky want to do this?
Well, we have reason to believe
that he's still making illegal whiskey
and a three-time loser has a way
of cooperating, if you know what I mean.
One question: When?
When?
Just in time for the National Convention
and your television report on the squeaky
clean government of Dunston County.
Sold. What do you need?

Ever since he got back from that place,
he ain't been won'th a tinker's damn.
Wants to be like an old tomcat, he wants
to prowl all night and sleep all day.
Ain't been able to get a lick of work
out of him since he got back.
Since when do you use beet sugar instead
of cane sugar like we're supposed to?
- Gator said.
- I've been making whiskey all my life.
No place in the book does it say
sugar beet's as good as cane.
Is that what they taught you
up in that place, boy?
What else did they teach you up there?
You know, I think that's what I missed
the most in the morning.
Your bitching and moaning.
You want some breakfast, girl?
- I ate before you got up.
- Yeah.
What time did they wake you up
in that place?
You hang around with murderers, thieves,
crooks and Lord knows what else.
Them ain't nice people
for you to hang around with.
- I'll try to remember that. Good idea.
- You lost all your respect for quality.
You name me one thing of quality
you can do today.
- Licence plates.
- Licence plates?!
Yeah, I can make quality licence plates.
I was gonna make you one,
but I didn't know how to spell "senile".
Senile, am I? I'm gonna have
to take you down a notch or two, Gator.
How'd you like I put a Dutch rub on you?
Do it, Grandpa. Do it, Grandpa.
And you, young lady, mind your manners.
Gator, this child's been
out of school too long.
Two years. She's beginning
to revert to the wilds.
Is that right, girl?
You reverting back to the wilds?
- Nope, I ain't.
- I'll tell you what else she needs.
She needs to hang around young 'uns her
own age, instead of an old codger like me.
- I ain't goir to school this year either.
- You ain't?
Yes, you is going back to school.
Come September,
you're gonna be in school, girl.
Can I play football?
- Yeah.
- And wear pretty little dresses, too.
Don't like no dresses.
Well, your mama sure did.
Hello there, puppy.
Hello, chopper. Hello, chopper.
This is Greenfield.
We're... lost.
Down there. Down there.
I think we got something.
What's that?
- What is that, Pop?
- It's a darn helicopter.
I know that, but who's in it?
- Looks like Fish and Game.
- Not in a helicopter.
Them's whiskey agents.
Mr Greenfield, we got him.
When you see him, drop a smoke bomb
and circle. You read me?
Drop a smoke bomb and circle!
- Head the boat toward the marker.
- I can't.
- What?
- I said I can't, sir.
- Sheriff, head the boat toward the marker.
- Can't do that, Mr Greenfield.
- We'll have to go around.
- I said turn the boat toward the marker!
Right.
{y:i}(Greenfield yells)
{y:i}(yells)
- Hate to lose a load to them.
- We won't.
- They've gotten serious.
- I'll give them a run for their money.
You do that. Don't worry.
They ain't gonna catch your pappy.
I ain't worried.
If they get too close,
Gator'll hit that jet on his boat.
They'll think they've been hit
by a tidal wave.
- Don't you worry.
- I ain't worried.
If that helicopter gets too close,
I'll shoot them in the butt with a full load.
- Don't you worry.
- I ain't worried.
I am! They're bombing us now.
That's the first time they ever done that.
"(Greenfield)" You did it.
You did it. You can't get it off.
What does it mean you can't get it off?
It means we're gonna be a while.
Maybe you'd like to call a cab.
A cab.
Cute.
{y:i}(yelling)
Sir, did you fire that shotgun?
- It was accidental, while I was cleaning it.
- You're a liar, Pop.
- Take it easy, Tom.
- Don't you call me no liar.
I'll shove this shotgun up your butt.
Get over there.
Don't let him talk like that in front of
my granddaughter, you rat-faced bastard!
Ow!
- Take it easy, Bob.
- Don't hit that child.
I'm not gonna hit her.
I just don't wanna feed her.
Mr Greenfield, we got the old man
and the girl over here.
Ned McKlusky, you're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent...
Stop that.
Boat four and five, what have you got?
This is boat four. I'm here with boat five.
We got nothing.
It's quiet.
Quiet as a church.
Pretty, too.
{y:i}That son of a gun disappeared into thin air.
Mr Greenfield, this is Officer Talmadge
in boat number five.
That ain't no ordinary boat he's got there.
Got some kind of a damn rocket on it.
Oh, shit!
Boat six, come in.
What have you got for me?
Boat nine, come in, nine.
{y:i}(engine fails to start)
Can anybody hear me up there?
{y:i}This is chopper. We got him spotted.
We got him. Damn it, we got him now.
I'm bringing him in, Mr Greenfield.
I'm bringing him in.
Chopper, sit down on him!
- "Do what?"
- Sit down on him!
Doesrt anybody up there speak English?
Can't you read my lips?
{y:i}Mr Greenfield, we'll have him
{y:i}in the chopper in a second.
{y:i}My God, he's getting away. After him!
What the hell's going on?
Have you got him or not?
We temporarily lost him.
Ten... come in, ten.
{y:i}(speedboat approaches)
Sounds like old Gator's coming.
I guess I'd better wake up.
Hell, the fishing's no good here.
The fish ain't biting on this side.
Oh, Lord.
That's some Gator.
Come in, chopper! Come in, chopper!
- No, don't tell me.
- Sounds like he got the chopper.
- Shut up!
- Oh, my God!
That's Gator McKlusky.
- The boat.
- Get your damn rifle. Quickly, son.
Gator McKlusky, you're under arrest!
Later.
"(Greenfield)" Hey, it's a nice swamp
you got here.
Where are they?
We got 'em.
My name's Irving Greenfield.
You thinking about putting up
condominiums out here?
I don't find that very funny at all.
- What do you want?
- Some time.
I just did some time.
- I know. Twice.
- You bet your ass I did.
No. You bet yours.
In fact, you did bet it twice and you lost.
What do you want?
- Bama McCall.
- Bama McCall?
Yeah.
I never heard of him.
He's having quite a time in Dunston
County. Prostitution, extortion, bribery.
What makes you think I'll help you
nail Bama McCall?
Well, if you don't want your old man
to be in jail for moonshining
and your little girl going from
one foster home to another, you will.
- You've got me by the short hairs, huh?
- Yes, I do.
It's incredible
what this guy's got going for him.
$20,000 in back taxes is all we can prove,
but that's just minor.
But we could use it to put him
out of commission.
- Get the picture?
- Yeah, I get the picture.
How do I know all that crap
on that paper's true?
Look, if he's clean, you can prove it.
If he's not, here's your chance to find out.
Come here. Come here.
I'll be back before you know I'm gone.
- Don't let Granddad sass you, now.
- I won't.
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Daddy.
I'll take over.
You drive.
- Why am I driving?
- I don't drive.
- You don't drive?
- I'm from New York, I don't drive.
Well, that makes sense. I guess
if you're from Boston, you don't fart.
{y:i}(burlesque music)
- $2, please.
- Well, well, what's your name?
- Cornelia.
- I like that. You're new here, ain't you?
Yeah, I'm new. We got a new bouncer, too.
Yeah, well, that's partly
why I'm here, Cornelia.
Say, what's a pretty little thing
like you doing in a joint like this?
- I was Miss Palatka 1973.
- Wonderful.
Miss Palatka, I wish you'd do me a favour.
I wish you'd go back there
and tell Mr Donahue
that Bama McCall is out here
about the insurance.
Hello, operator, give me the police.
Bama McCall, insurance, yeah,
I can remember that. I'll tell him.
Sure.
We're gonna take a five-minute break,
so the girls have a chance
to go potty and have a little drink.
{y:i}(men cheer)
- You must be the new bouncer.
- Yeah.
- Son, you're a healthy-looking mother.
- Yeah.
Look at them arms. A little warm, ain't it?
- Yeah.
- Well, my name is Bama McCall.
I don't usually come by here
to make collections,
but I just wanted to come by and say hello.
- Goodbye.
- "(man)" Get him!
Hello, ladies.
Well, Donahue, that's a couple
of pretty good bouncers you got there.
I bounced one off of the wall
and one right through the window.
That's a good one, Mr McCall.
But I'm only the manager here.
The people in Detroit own the club.
They have to have authorisation
for anything they pay out.
You know what?
This damn place is a fire trap.
I called them, Mr McCall,
and said you'd said that.
Do I hear you telling me your associates
in Detroit are inconsiderate?
Is that what you're telling me?
Well, that's a shame.
That's a shame.
I can call them back.
I can call them back right now.
I can call them back.
Bob, we better be getting on over
to the Southside Shuffle.
Can't you see I'm eating my supper?
{y:i}(horn)
/ Ridir along, da-dee da-da... /
{y:i}(they whistle and hum)
Look at this. I'm riding with a nut named
Gator, looking for a putz named Bama.
Don't you people have regular names?
You mean intelligent names like
you've got in New York City like... Yogi?
Yeah, cute.
Do you have to drive so fast?
I don't get a chance like this very often.
Cop stops me, I'll just flash him my badge.
What badge?
- Your badge.
- We're undercover men, goddamn it.
Undercover. You undercover in Dunston.
You're gonna stick out in Dunston
like a bagel in a bucket of grits.
{y:i}(ship's horn)
- Mighty pretty city.
- Is that Dunston?
No, it's Newark.
- I think I'm losing control.
- Why?
I'm beginning to think you're funny.
Yours is a little lumpy,
but mine doesn't look too bad.
(GREENFIELD) Yours doesn't look too bad.
That's pretty funny.
Almost as funny as Newark.
Pretty lumpy, huh?
On the other hand, I don't know.
What's going on?
- This is where you're staying.
- Why?
You're undercover. Nobody would think
of looking for you in this crappy place.
- Where are you gonna stay?
- You don't expect me to stay in a dump.
Come on.
{y:i}(cheering)
Hey, folks, here comes the Dunston
High School band. There they are!
We won, didn't we, folks?
Chief Billy Joe Williams
and the Police Department
made that a donation to the campaign.
I think you like what
we got going in Dunston, don't you?
Do you folks know the difference between
Uncle Sam, a rooster and an old maid?
Uncle Sam says Yankee-doodle-do,
a rooster says cock-a-doodle-do
and an old maid says any old dude'll do.
{y:i}(laughter and applause)
When that TV camera starts showing us,
I want you all to show your best.
'Cause you got the best, and we're gonna
have the best city south of Baltimore.
Who in the hell gives a damn
what's north of Baltimore?
Hey, you tyke there.
Come down here, sweetie.
Miss Cavanaugh, you're welcome to stay
as long as you don't make a disturbance.
We can't have you interfering
with the festivities
with all your yelling and your screaming.
I'll have to escort you out of the park.
Patrick McGinnin, I have known you
since you were eleven years old
and you were a sweet young man
and your father a Catholic priest.
- Baptist minister.
- Right.
I still think you're a sweet young man,
but you're not escorting me anywhere.
Sorry.
Miss Cavanaugh,
I don't want to have to arrest you.
Patrick, you must understand
that I am not hitting you.
I am hitting Mayor Caffrey
and all his corruption,
and here's another blow for freedom.
And what about unemployment?
What's Caffrey gonna do about that?
What's he gonna do
about the underprivileged?
Stick me in the eye with that sign,
you're gonna be in real trouble.
I'm a citizen. I've got my rights.
I'd like to stick it someplace else.
"(Caffrey)" I just feel happy. I'm so
grateful for all you folks coming here...
You don't believe all that crap, do you?
Gator! What the hell are you doing here?
- I came down...
- Sh.
- Hi, Bama. Hi.
- Hi.
- What's your name?
- Gator.
Alligator. Where have you been all my life?
All your life? In prison.
See you later, alligator.
Do you know how long it's been
since I've seen you?
It was what... Owney Matsors dirt track?
No. That ain't it. It was the night we was
drinking at that joint in Willow Springs.
- What you been doing?
- Time.
Time...
What are you doing hanging around here?
I heard you was the cock of the walk down
here. I came down to find out if it was true.
Bones.
Meet my dearest friend in the world.
Mr Gator McKlusky, Bones.
Ask him why they call him Bones.
- Why do they call you Bones?
- 'Cause I tell 'em to.
- Right.
- Go get Mayor Bob. Bring him here.
- I want him to meet Gator.
- A very intelligent look about him.
- Yeah, he's my social secretary.
- I see.
- Do you remember Coach Ferguson?
- Sure.
Baldy.
Do you remember the night
we played for Hokey?
We won nine straight ball games.
We thought we were a bunch of killers.
Hokey was just cleaning our plough.
Running us clean out the stadium.
{y:i}(McCall's voice fades)
Do you remember that?
- Yeah.
- I wonder what old Skeeter's doing now.
Probably still making
that same dumb speech.
{y:i}(hysterical laughter)
"(Caffrey)" My God, I feel like I've died
and gone to heaven.
How do you feel, Gator?
Well, I feel like I'm at Mount Rushmore.
Hello there. My name's Smiley.
- No shit.
- Nope.
I understand you just got out of the clinker.
Yeah.
Well, I ain't never been,
but I hear there's a whole bunch of queers
just crawling all over your body up there.
Yeah, that's what they say.
Every so often you hear
a yell or two in the night?
Yeah.
- I know the sound.
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
- Hello, Pogie. Yeah, now, look...
Fine. Look, Pogie, I want you
to do something for me.
I want you to check on
a guy named Gator McKlusky.
I'm gonna show you
how we do a little collecting.
I'm gonna give you
the black section to start with, Gator.
There's only two things you've got
to remember about blacks.
That's this. One day, they can be real easy.
And then the next day, they can be... bad.
But best I can remember, you always
were a little colour-blind, werert you?
What the hell is that?
That's to make them blacks easy.
Hey. Would you?
In a New York minute.
- Mr Bama.
- Well, Big George.
Go in there and tell JJ
I've come for my sugar.
That is real sweet, George. I love that.
George, you're getting my shits on.
Cut the crap and you go
and do what I told you to do.
"(mockingly)" Yawza, boss, yawza.
The man from glad is here.
- You didn't make him mad, did you?
- I hope so.
Black is beautiful. I love it.
- You go tell him you're gone.
- I'm gone.
Look...
Wait a minute. God Almighty,
what about the laws in this town?
Hey, I got a permit to carry this thing, son.
Where are the cops at?
Right there.
"(JJ)" Shit! Every time he come around,
he blows up something.
- Well, JJ.
- Hi, Bama.
Where are you going? You owe me money.
Just off to get my tyre fixed, man.
You owe me $500, JJ.
Man, it slipped my mind.
I got it right here in my pocket.
Now, son, that's a thing of beauty
and a joy to behold. Is that gorgeous?
Sometimes my vocabulary
just ain't adequate
to describe the beauty
and the grandeur of it all.
Gator, you got to get used
to this high living.
I don't know if I can stand it.
Is he supposed to do that?
Yeah.
For whose benefit, mine or his?
All right, I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna start you out at $400 a week.
But, now, you can't take
nothing out of the bag.
Sounds good.
- Telephone, Mr McCall.
- Thank you, Tom.
Hello.
Pogie. Yeah.
Well, it's your dime, you do the talking.
Super. OK.
I love it.
OK. See you, Pog.
What's it gonna be? Gonna be steak?
You want steak, lobster?
- Maybe you want both?
- Mr McCall, I'd like to speak to you.
Aggie. Gator McKlusky,
say hello to Agatha Maybank.
She's the star of Dunston County
television. Sit down, Aggie.
- You had my series cancelled.
- Your what?
The documentary show on poverty
that we were doing in Dunston County.
- Who told you that?
- Caffrey's office.
Oh, Caffrey's office.
Well, I'm afraid you might have
overestimated my influence a bit.
But, on the other hand, nobody likes
to watch that junk on television anyway.
Hell, it's depressing, ain't it?
Mr McCall,
television is independently owned
and there's a regulation that forbids
interference by local political authorities.
Honey, if you want to have a drink with us,
you're welcome to stay.
But if you come over here to piss
and moan at me, excuse my French,
then I don't want to hear your womers lib
poverty programme bullshit.
Not while I'm enjoying
my meal with my friend.
- And paying for it with my own money.
- I see.
But you are welcome
to stay and have a drink,
if that's what they taught you
up there at Vassar or NBC.
No, but they did teach me where
the Civil Liberties Uniors located.
Mr McKlusky.
Nice ass.
A little uppity.
{y:i}(woman singing)
/ Sweet sacrament divine /
Real pretty.
Thank you.
Are you the man?
Yeah.
They said a new one was coming.
I'm about as new as you can get.
Policy numbers wasrt no good this week.
I made a little change on the horses,
some on the dogs.
Come on. Let me get my book.
And the money.
You kids, go on, slide on out of here.
Now!
It's all here, mister. You can count it.
- I don't have to count it.
- I don't want trouble with Mr McCall.
I can't afford no fire.
There ain't gonna be no fire.
OK.
Hey, sign the paper, man.
Thank you.
{y:i}(chatter)
- Where's Bama?
- He's inside.
Hi. I'm Tinker.
I'm Gator. Is... Bama around?
He's in there.
He's always in there.
Thank you.
Oh, hey. Don't you ever knock
on the door or nothing? Huh?
I mean, you could have caught a fella
with his britches down.
Sorry. I want to talk to you alone. OK?
You mean her?
Then, son, we're alone.
- What's she on?
- She's on Quaaludes.
She's on Mandrax. She's on Parest.
She's on coke.
You name it, son.
If they make it, then that chick'll take it.
- She can't be more than 15.
- I don't go by age. I go by weight.
Your mama and my mama both
done married, both done young 'uns
and the whole shooting match when
they werert a damn bit older than her.
Yeah.
Gator, look, son, I don't hook these chicks.
I don't hustle these chicks.
I damn sure don't go out on the street
and drag 'em in here.
They come to pay for that habit they got.
Well, there's money
and there's money, Bama.
Well, I didn't make the world
the way it was, Gator.
No, you just collect off it.
Now, look, son, they had a man before me
and they're gonna have
a man after me. Right?
Hey, come here a minute.
I want to show you something.
You're gonna love that. Sit down.
- How's your old man doing?
- Fine.
- How old is he now?
- 74.
74. He's 74.
He's about lived his threescore
and ten, like the Bible said.
Pretty soon he'll be gone. He'll be dead.
In the meantime, what you can hold
in your hand, you got, son.
And what you can taste, you got.
All the poontang you get, that's yours.
Nobody can take that away from you.
I hate to be the one to tell you this,
but everybody out there,
everybody's a taker, I mean it, from
the top, son, to the bottom, all takers.
And you have got to reach out there
and you've got to take it.
If you don't, somebody'll reach out
like that and they're gonna take you.
Now, does that make sense? Huh?
- Maybe.
- Maybe.
Come on.
Now, son, before you there is a young,
beautiful, tender flower of passion.
So, I tell you what.
You get over there
and I bet you that pretty thing will make
you forget whatever's gnawing at you.
Go on, sport. You need to get
your pipes cleaned out anyway.
It's my Tinker.
Here you go, killer. Hold that.
You all be nice to one another, now,
and I'll see you later. Bye.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
From the political rally.
Alligator.
Yeah.
Do you find me pretty?
Yeah. I'm thinking of adopting you.
Why are you so far away?
Come here.
I'll treat you like a king.
Why would you want to do that?
I could do things.
Certain things.
{y:i}(music-box waltz)
{y:i}(sniffs)
How old are you?
Fifteen and a half.
Fifteen and a half?
Ain't nobody up here older than 16.
Bama likes it that way.
Bridger, I won't let you down.
I never have let anyone down.
Just don't worry.
Bridger, he's busy making the collection.
Look, it takes time to build a case like this.
You know and I know.
Yeah, I'm at his... um... um...
I'm at my hotel now.
Yeah. It's nice.
- It's nice.
- Excuse me, sir.
Are you a registered guest at this hotel?
No, I'm not.
Then you'll have to leave.
Now.
Bridger, I'll get back to you.
{y:i}(chatter)
"(McCall)" Them fours look kind of small.
Another game. One more hand.
Bama, I wanna talk to you a minute, OK?
Well, damn, Gator, I'm gonna
have to change your name to Rabbit.
Son, don't interrupt me
while I'm winning at poker.
Now.
I believe you're serious.
Smiley, take Gator in the bar.
Bones, take care of this.
Fellas, excuse me.
Killer, I'll be back in a minute.
Chalky.
Bones.
Bones, fix us a couple of drinks.
All right, what's on your mind, Gator?
I want out.
I need to go home.
There ain't nothing waiting on you
at home except a whiskey bust.
I'll worry about that when I get home.
I've seen your operation, Bama.
I don't like what I see.
All right, I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll have a drink and we'll talk about it.
I always could drink your ass
under the table anyway.
That's a great accomplishment.
Bones, make those drinks strong, son.
I want to ask you something, Bama,
and I want you to tell me the truth.
- Did you ever kill anybody?
- Well, not so's you'd notice.
Have a good trip, Gator.
How much do you figure you owe
the state in back taxes?
Well, probably, if they tried real hard,
they'd get me $65-70,000, I reckon.
What if I told you that I knew for sure
you could pay them back $20,000
and that would be all you owed them?
You could give up all this stuff, you know.
{y:i}(McCall laughs)
Hell, I don't want to forget this stuff, Gator.
I kind of like this stuff.
Now, what else is on your mind?
Nothing. Goodbye.
I don't know what
you're worried about $20,000 for.
You can sell Bones here
for $10,000 to the circus.
He has a wonderful sense of humour.
Don't you, Bones?
Am I talking too fast for you, Bones?
{y:i}(he laughs)
- They must be a lot of fun to talk to.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, great conversationalists.
- Yeah, they are.
You sure are having a good time off
that junk old Bones put in your drink.
Did you put something in my drink?
- Yellows.
- "(mimics)" Yellows.
Yellows.
That's a good colour for you, Bones.
Yellow.
He's making me mad.
"He's making me mad." He kills me.
{y:i}(laughs)
All right, Gator, look...
- You're gonna pass out in a minute.
- Pass out?
- Pass out. Now, when you wake up...
- "(Gator)" Wake up.
...you're gonna be in your car
outside the county line.
- I'm gonna pass out?
- You're gonna pass out.
- You want to go home.
- Want to go home.
Where that car's gonna be pointed.
You drive it there.
'Cause I love you, boy.
So don't make me hurt you.
- I'm gonna pass out in a minute?
- About a minute.
Well, I'll just stand here for a minute
and wait till that happens.
I'll just stand here between two men
that ought to be PO'd at God.
'Cause when he was handing out brains,
he didn't give you nothing but height.
And you nothing but teeth.
You say about a minute? Well, I'd say
about 50 seconds have gone by.
That gives me...
nine, eight, seven, six...
five, seven, six, five...
One... one, right?
I only got one second.
Oh, shit.
He's still here.
And I'm still here.
Wait a minute. What am I laughing about?
I ought to be gone by now.
I was...
I was way... I was way off.
Way off.
Bones, put him in the car like I said
and take him to the county line.
Don't hurt him. Don't you hurt him.
What's important, Charlie,
sitting drinking like this,
it's information and the connection
and the deal, you know?
Charlie, you got to know
who the guy with the brass nuts is.
Do you know what I mean? That's it.
Where are you from, buddy?
North of here.
Like 1200 miles north?
Oh, no.
You don't look like you're from round here.
I don't get out much.
What are you asking Charlie
all those questions for?
Charlie don't know
a damn thing about anything.
Why don't you just talk about
getting some squish?
That's exactly what we were talking about.
You know, Charlie, I think
you'd be better off if you lost a few.
Like me, too big. Too much.
Did you ever hear of the water diet?
And ice is very good for you, see?
Actually, a ton of ice.
It's Pogie, let me talk to Mr McCall.
Mr McCall...
...it's him.
I mean eight glasses. It's like a crash,
you know what I mean? Like a chicken.
Hello, Mr Greenfield.
You don't know me. I used to see you up
at the state capitol building all the time.
You're with the United States Department
of Justice, am I right?
No. No. No...
No, I...
I believe you got me mixed up
with my brother Irving.
My name is Tex. Tex Greenfield.
No, I seen you up at the hotel.
I figured I'd seen you from someplace,
but I couldn't quite figure it out.
Well, I think I got to go now, you know.
A couple of squishes waiting for me...
So, I got to putting two and two together.
Mr Greenfield and the Justice Department
are down here working on something.
You got something going, am I right?
You didn't finish your beer, Mr Greenfield.
It's funny to see a guy like you
in a place like this.
Seems like you might have come
to see the law, Mr Greenfield.
{y:i}(whispering then laughter)
I got to go.
OK, Charlie. I know, the beer...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Good, Charlie. Yeah.
Oh, Charlie.
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.
"(d"oo"r bolts)"
{y:i}(car approaches)
{y:i}(birdsong)
{y:i}(groans)
{y:i}(groaning)
I'm sorry, Mr Greenfield. I'm really sorry.
As soon as I heard you were here, I came
here without breakfast. How is he, Doc?
Contusion of the left testicle.
Cervical neck strain and sprain.
- Fractures of the rib...
- Out, Doc.
Thank you, Doc.
We don't want the Federal people
thinking we didn't do right by their fella.
{y:i}(yells)
- I'm sorry.
- No, you wouldn't.
There were two of them. One was big.
Oh, big. Big.
We're gonna get a full description
as soon as you start feeling better.
- Mr McKlusky, "Eyewitness News" here.
- Holy Christ.
Is it true Mr Greenfield is
a government agent?
I don't know what you're talking about.
The police said he was arrested while
drunk and they don't know his assignment.
- Could you tell us?
- Well, Miss... Maybank.
Well, the only thing I know is what
Mr Greenfield does for a living.
He works for a ladies' hygiene spray.
I believe it's called Sprunt.
Very clever. Very clever.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Yeah.
You can get me a private phone.
Or does Bama McCall have
Southern Bell locked up, too?
No, we're gonna get you your phone now.
Sorry about that.
- The police beat him up, didn't they?
- Want a Moon Pie?
No, thank you.
- It was the police, wasrt it?
- How do I know?
- You're smarter than you look.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Want some coffee?
No, thank you.
- Are you following me?
- Yes, I am.
Good.
What is Greenfield,
Department of Justice or State Police?
- Take a left.
- Take a left?
- That's funny.
- You think that's funny?
- You're a schmuck.
- Learn that at Vassar?
Radcliffe. I want to see Greenfield.
- You do?
- I do, and I think you can arrange it.
- Mr Greenfield.
- When I was a kid in Brooklyn,
I can remember guys like
Thurman Arnold and Fiorello La Guardia.
- What do you think they do now?
- Fiorello who?
La Guardia, you putz.
He cleaned up New York 35 years ago.
- Yeah? It got dirty again.
- I know a woman, Emmeline Cavanaugh.
She showed me all the phoney tax records
of McCall and Caffrey.
- Come on, you're kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.
If she can get anything, I mean anything,
in phoney tax accounting,
there's a reward in it for her.
- She had access to the records?
- Yes. That's right. That's right.
She worked at City Hall for 22 years
and Caffrey just fired her.
Well, that's it. Go back to your brat kid
and your moonshine. Get out of my hair.
Are you telling me I'm off the hook?
- I'm telling you to get out of my life.
- Mr Greenfield, we have to sedate you.
- Sedate me, my ass.
- What did you say?
- I said sedate me, my ass!
- Fine.
{y:i}(whimpers)
- Where are you going?
- To find a massage parlour.
- Wort you talk to Miss Cavanaugh?
- Does she give massages?
I don't understand. Are you working
with Greenfield or not?
I'm trying not to get killed
and stay out of the slammer.
What are you talking about?
{y:i}(whistles badly)
- You rang?
- "(as Mae West)" Can I buy you a drink?
Is a pig's ass pork?
Of course you can buy me a drink.
Womers lib, I love it. Because you buy
me a drink doesn't mean you own me.
I know how you are, you turn
into an octopus. Women are all alike.
You're all animals.
- My car.
- Very conservative.
Yes.
I'm gonna blow your frigging head off.
No. Don't do this.
{y:i}(horn)
Oh, my feet!
- Let me go!
- You want out? You want loose? There.
- Bones, I knew I could count on you.
- I've always been your friend, Smiley.
You know that. I'll take care of you.
You're gonna be all right.
No!
You're leaving me!
Hi, guy.
Goodbye, guy!
Listen, I think you'll like her.
But some people think
she's a little strange.
Well, I can handle strange.
Right.
Do you love my cats? I love my cats.
I love all living things.
Except flies.
Caffrey is a bad person.
- Tell us about the flies... the files?
- I have two cats.
There are two sets of accounts
in Caffrey's personal files.
One, he pays taxes on, one he does not.
What outside companies is he involved in?
Apex Finance, Dixie Entertainment,
all those gas stations.
All of them owned by Caffrey and McCall.
And all of them exploiting the masses.
/ La, la! La-la-la-la! /
He loves music.
- Didrt you see how he loved that?
- Yeah, he's going crazy.
Could we talk about the records?
- You may have those records.
- How is that possible?
You may go with me into the courthouse
and we'll make copies of all the records.
- Wort that be a little dangerous?
- It'll be thrilling.
But you don't work
at the courthouse any more.
I don't? Well, of course I don't,
but I detest dishonesty.
So I stole the keys.
This is it right here.
Not now. Wait a minute.
Come on.
Wait. Wait. I want to take my babies.
We're not taking the cats.
Then I'm not going.
Oh, God.
- Take the cats?
- We're taking the cats.
- We're taking the cats.
- You take Silver Bell.
You take Red. I've got the keys.
Right.
Whoa!
I can't believe I'm doing this.
{y:i}(cat miaows)
You have the strongest hands.
It's just like a spy movie.
She belongs in a rubber room.
{y:i}(whistling)
You didn't tell me
about the nightwatchman.
But he's such a nice man.
She's crazy.
- Is this the room?
- No.
This is where all the new books are.
Emmeline,
Red's scratching the hell out of me.
He loves you.
We'll go in here.
The Caffrey books are in here.
I'll show you some accounts
that will knock you sideways.
This is the Xerox room.
Now, put Red and Silver Bell right there
and I'll get the light.
- Keys, keys.
- Keys, yes.
Is this it?
Now, these are very heavy,
so don't hurt yourself.
Here, here.
Hernia time. Put it on the counter.
Now, stay there, little sweethearts.
You see right here, C for Caffrey.
- Between L and R is M for McCall.
- Makes sense.
- Everything's here.
- Where's McCall?
McCall, right there.
Right here. M-C. Here. There. Everything.
- Everything's there.
- This is terrific. This is wonderful.
{y:i}(miaowing)
Babies.
- We can't carry these books out of here.
- But we've got the Xerox machine.
- I got it.
- I'll take this one.
- "(alarm)"
- Let's get out of here. My babies!
I'll get Red. Where is he?
I don't care. Get him! Hurry up!
Go! Go!
Back! Back!
Stop or I'll shoot!
{y:i}(gunshot)
You left your keys
in the car again, didn't you, Red?
Aw, shut up.
{y:i}(phone rings)
Oy!
Oy!
- Hello?
- Greenie, this is Gator.
- "Yeah?"
- We got it, got the whole shooting match.
- Caffrey's records, McCall's, everything.
- Really? Ow!
Really, yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
Forget tomorrow morning, you schmuck.
- What time is it? Where are you now?
- I'm nearby. Why?
I'm getting dressed. Meet me at the
emergency entrance in five minutes.
What the hell are you talking about?
Greenie?
Oy!
- "(Greenfield)" Oy!
- Oy!
"(Greenfield)" Oy!
- Oy!
- Oy!
- Oy!
- Oy!
- Agh!
- Oy!
- Oy!
- Oy!
Oy!
Two Jews in pain.
Let my people go already.
- Oy!
- Oy!
I think you're being oversensitive.
He wasrt that way when I dated him.
Or when Carol Ann dated him.
Carol Ann did date him.
You didn't know that?
Yes, of course.
No, if you didn't know that about him,
you know...
I don't know what to tell you.
Good night, Nurse.
See you in the morning.
Good night, Doctor.
Get in the car, fatty.
Agh!
Get in the car! Get in the car!
- How do you get in the car?
- "(Emmeline)" How do you do?
We've got to ditch this car. It's hot.
Then we've got to find a hideout
and then get another getaway car.
OK, we'll go to my house, we'll change
cars, then we'll go to my Uncle Hunsy's.
He's got a place at the beach.
Nobody's there this time of year.
Wait a minute. Who said that
you could make all the decisions?
I should be making the decisions.
That was a good decision
that you made there.
- Wasrt that a good one?
- Thank you.
You're right.
All right, Billy Joe, what is it?
Somebody broke in the old file room
and they got Caffrey's records.
- And?
- And they got your records. Everybody's.
Oh, my God.
We've got the roads blocked,
the airport, everything.
- They'll never get out of town.
- Yeah.
Well, I've been nice to him long enough.
Now I'm gonna kill him.
You got '71 there?
'68 and '72 are all mixed up.
Yes.
Not on the pages.
That's a Class 1 indictment.
I wish you wouldn't yell at me.
You'd better get to a phone,
McKlusky, and call my office.
Where the hell am I gonna find a phone
at five o'clock in the morning?
I think we could use
a little more firewood, don't you?
All right.
Probably some driftwood out on the beach.
Probably.
Want to give me a hand?
I'll give you two.
They're going out on the beach
to get some driftwood.
For the fire.
Race you!
I bet they're gonna walk
in the moonlight.
Good luck to them. If there's moonlight,
they'll walk in it, right?
You're a very masculine man.
Lady, will you give me a break, please?
- I'll bet you think I've never been married.
- I don't care.
Well, I've never been married.
- In fact, I've never even been...
- Lady!
I'm strangely attracted to you.
Oh, my God.
- Feet warm?
- Yes, very toasty.
- You know what?
- What?
I don't know anything about you.
I don't know anything about me either.
I don't believe that.
I think you know exactly who you are.
Well, I think I was born
about 100 years too late.
Should have been around when
not having any style was in style.
You're crazy, McKlusky.
You've got style. You got a lot of style.
Really?
I styled myself right into prison.
Two times.
Four years.
- I do one thing good, though.
- What's that?
- Make pretty babies.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I can prove it.
- Who asked you to?
I'm talking about
my nine-year-old daughter.
She's about nine years old, going on 35.
Where's her mother?
I don't know.
After a couple of years,
she got tired of waiting and...
...cut out.
You gonna have some kids sometime?
No.
Ever been to New York City?
- What?
- Have you ever been to New York?
No. I heard the only gators
they got up there are in the sewer.
Yes, sir. Hell, that bugs me.
People come here and buy
baby alligators, go back to New York
and when they get bored with them,
they flush them down the toilet.
You know what they live on in the sewers?
They live on balls of tubifex worms
about 12 feet across
and they go rolling down the sewers
and they live on that and sewer rats.
They say they get to be ten feet.
You know what they want me
to do at the station?
They want me to fill this in.
Do you think this looks better?
- You mean the gap filled?
- Fill the gap, yes.
Come on, what do you think?
- Do you want me to be honest?
- Yes.
I think you look a lot better that way.
Male chauvinist porker.
Sure is dark out here.
Uh-huh.
Quite exciting.
Do you like the ocean?
- I love the ocean.
- Me, too.
It's beautiful.
Sometimes I hate to look at it all at once.
I have to look at it a little bit at a time.
I'm afraid if I look at it all at once,
it'll disappear.
That's the way I have to look at you.
A little bit at a time.
I'm afraid if I look at you all at once,
you'll disappear.
OK.
You charmed the shirt right off my back.
Now what?
Take off Uncle Hunsy's hat.
You got it.
I don't wanna get up.
- You gotta get up.
- I don't wanna get up.
What do you want to do?
I want to win the Pulitzer Prize
and make love to you on the terrace
of a New York apartment, a penthouse.
Would you settle for an old rotary club
football trophy and a hump in the swamp?
No, I wouldn't.
I didn't think you would.
Well, you're right.
- I'll race you back to the house.
- Aw!
Come on.
Rainbow Club, $5,473.
- Joe's Market...
- Morning.
- You'd better get on the phone to Bridges.
- How was the beach? Did you get a tan?
A phone. I know where there's a phone.
- She knows where there's a phone.
- We need groceries. I made a list.
Lots of cat food and some sandwiches.
You all behave.
You all behave.
"(child)" Seven, eight, six...
...eight, nine.
Hi, Billy Raybolt, we found your lost dog.
How much is the reward this time?
Excuse me. I got to make a call.
You want to step out a minute?
- Step out a second.
- Tell him we found his dog.
He don't believe me.
- Who am I talking to?
- "(children)" Billy Raybolt.
Billy, they got...
Billy, they got your dog.
It don't matter who I am. We got your dog.
How do I know? 'Cause I'm stepping
over him. Come and get your damn dog.
Hi, Billy. This is Jimmy.
- He said he ain't coming.
- Why?
'Cause you cursed at him. He ain't coming
until you tell him you're sorry.
Hello, Billy.
Billy...
I'm sorry.
What?
I cross my heart and hope to die
- and stick my finger in the sky.
- Point! Point!
Point my finger in the sky.
OK, now, come get your frigging dog.
OK, out.
I wanna make a collect call
to Mr Jack Bridger.
That newslady's uncle owns a beach
house at 53 Outer Island Lane.
- It's out past the boatyard.
- All right.
You keep your guys here
and let me handle it, OK?
We don't have time
for you to get back to me.
Get somebody down here.
53 Outer Island Lane, Dunston Beach.
Right.
- How much was the reward for the dog?
- A dollar.
Apiece.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
You know, I'm gonna change Red's name
to Mr Greenfield 'cause he's so sweet.
Gee, that's terrific.
{y:i}(very low groaning)
{y:i}(trigger clicks)
Go for it.
Try it, partner.
You can reach it.
You're thinking about it, ain't you?
Well, go ahead. You might even make it.
Get her the hell out of here.
{y:i}(muffled cries)
Let me go! My babies! My babies!
Bring her and come on.
Right in the...!
{y:i}(she screams)
Oh, God.
Move now!
Aggie, we got to get out of here.
We got to get out of here now.
Stay.
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon, sir.
- You got any empty rooms?
- At this time of season, we got a lot.
- Take your pick.
- How about that one down on the end?
Down there?
You don't have to go that far.
- I ain't gonna bother you none.
- Well, I just got married.
Newly-weds, you know,
we'd like a little privacy.
Newly-wed, huh?
Just got married?
Gonna make some noise tonight?
- Maybe a little.
- OK.
Why don't we fill this card out?
How'd you like Mr Smith? Mr Jones?
McKlusky. Gator McKlusky.
Greenfield's dead.
No, I'm positive he's dead.
There's gonna be more people dead
if you don't get down here soon.
You understand what I'm telling you?
It's come-and-get-us time.
Right. I'm at the Ocean Plaza Motel,
Dunston Beach.
Get some people down here... now.
Operator, get me
the Dunston Police Department, please.
- Dunston Police Department.
- I want to talk to Bama McCall.
- Just tell him Gator's calling.
- Mr McCall is not with the police.
I know that, darling, but he's got
a phone in that big red car of his.
Just get him on the goddamn phone.
Someone on the line wants to talk to you,
Mr McCall. He insists he knows you.
- Who is it?
{y:i}- Well, he just said Gator.
Oh? Well, put the boy on, honey.
- "Gator?"
- Yeah, it's me.
- Gator, where are you at, boy?
- You'll find out.
I want $2,000
and a plane ticket back home.
Well, son, I thought
you had already gone home.
- What do you want $2,000 for?
- I got something you want.
Some papers.
Some accounting papers, stuff like that.
Well, I heard all them papers
done burned up.
Not all of them.
All right, you got a deal.
Just tell me where I got to bring 'em.
$2,000 and a plane ticket back home.
$2,000 and a plane ticket.
All I got to know is where you're at.
You ain't gonna bring that nasty old gun
with you, are you, Bama?
No. I ain't gonna bring that gun, Gator.
The Ocean Plaza Motel, Dunston Beach.
Turn this son of a bitch around.
You all right?
Yeah.
I need your help.
You got it.
I want you to take those pillows and make
a couple of lumps out of the bed sheet.
- Like you and me?
- Right.
OK.
Aggie... pull the drapes, huh?
{y:i}(gas flows)
Let's get out of here.
Easy.
Bones, I'm gonna let you have this one.
Yeah.
"(McCall)" Holy shit!
Ow!
Move! Move, dummy, move!
{y:i}(yelling)
{y:i}(car approaches)
- Hi.
- Hi.
Come here.
- I saw you last night.
- You did? Did you really?
National. I went national. Did you
hear how Cronkite introduced me?
- I don't remember the exact words, no.

"In Dunston County,
Aggie Weedow Maybank has the story."
That's practically the first time
in my life anybody said it right.
- I can understand that.
- I was sitting in the room.
My hands were dripping sweat I was
so nervous, and they had champagne.
I kept thinking, "What if the tape breaks?"
You looked wonderful.
Gator, I'm so happy.
I didn't even tell you the best part.
They called me from New York
and they want me to...
Go on. They want you to go
to New York and what?
CBS called and they want me to bring
some tapes over and do some interviews.
Probably nothing will happen.
Yes, it will, 'cause you want it so much.
I want it more than anything in the world.
I know.
I wanted you to meet my daughter.
I'd love to meet her some day.
I love you.
I know. I know.
New York, huh?
I learned a lot from you.
I learned a lot from you, too.
I'll see you.
