I'VE GONE AWAY
FOR TO STAY A LITTLE WHILE
BUT I'M COMING BACK
I'M COMING BACK
IF IT BE 10,000 MILES
OKAY! LOAD 'EM UP!
HEY, YOU!
GET THAT POOCH
OUT OF HERE.
DO YOU WANT
TO GET HIM KILLED?
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
COME ON. QUIT STALLING.
WELL, SO LONG, ARAB.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT?
SO LONG, BABY.
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!
YOU HEARD THE LIEUTENANT!
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH THE DOG, HUH?
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HIM?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
WE CAN'T KEEP THAT DOG AROUND.
AW, YOU POOR
LITTLE FELLA.
HE'S GONNA FREEZE
OUT THERE.
GOODBYE, ARAB.
WELL, THANKS.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO --
CORRESPONDENT, HUH?
WELL, YOU WANT TO GET UP
TO THE FRONT, DON'T YOU?
WELL, GET IN.
NO, NO.
COME ON. COME ON.
GET IN!
MAKE IT SNAPPY!
HERE, MAKE ROOM
FOR THIS GUY.
HE AIN'T A BAD GUY,
IS HE?
HEY.
YOU'RE BACK WITH US.
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET MOVING!
HEY, GAWKY, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
CALL THAT PURP, BETTY GORDON?
LAY OFF THE GAWK.
HE'S MY TERRITORY.
YEAH.
WHO'S BETTY GORDON?
AH, THE KID'S BEEN WAITING
FOR A LETTER FROM HER
EVER SINCE
 WE LEFT THE STATES.
GUESS YOU'RE GETTING OFF
AT THE FIRST AIR BASE,
AIN'T YOU, POP?
WHY?
CORRESPONDENT, AIN'T YOU?
THE FLIERS ARE THE GUYS
YOU GUYS ALWAYS WRITE ABOUT.
THE HOLLYWOOD HEROES.
WE'RE JUST THE MUGS
 ALONG FOR THE RIDE.
THAT'S ALL.
JUST FOR THE RIDE.
ASK WINGLESS.
HE'LL TELL YOU.
YEAH. JUST ONE PLANE,
AND YOU'RE ALL DEAD DUCKS.
JUST ONE PLANE, AND IT'S
ALL RIGHT, MEN.
THIS IS A BREAK.
UNLOAD.
HEY, HOW FAR UP YOU GOING,
MISTER, UH...
PYLE.
PROBABLY END OF THE LINE,
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU.
SURE.
PYLE?
YOU SAY PYLE?
MM-HMM.
SAY, AREN'T YOU THE FELLOW
WHO WRITES THAT COLUMN
ABOUT, UH, WEEKEND TRIPS
OR SOMETHING?
MOSTLY ABOUT SOMETHING.
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD-LOOKING
OUTFIT YOU GOT.
WELL, WE'RE NOT
AN OUTFIT YET.
MAYBE BY THIS TIME TOMORROW,
WE WILL BE.
LOAD 'EM UP!
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, MEN.
ON THE TRUCK.
LOAD UP.
COME ON,
ON THE DOUBLE.
SAY, COME TO THINK OF IT,
YOU KNOW, MY OLD MAN
READS YOUR COLUMN.
HE THINKS IT'S GREAT.
WELL, I'LL BE DARNED.
ALL RIGHT, MEN.
LET'S GET ON.
HEY, FELLAS, GET A LOAD
OF THIS -- ARTIE SHAW!
SOLID, JACK.
OUT OF THIS WORLD.
GEE WHIZ, MURPH.
I WISH YOU WEREN'T SO LONG.
IT'S SORT OF COLD
OUT HERE IN THE OPEN.
I'LL CUT MY LEGS OFF.
NO, GEEZ, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.
I HEAR WE'RE GETTING
IN THE REAL BUSINESS TOMORROW.
WELL, SO FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
THEY CAN DEAL ME OUT.
THE INFANTRY
AIN'T SO WORSE.
LOOK, THIS IS A MODERN WAR,
AIN'T IT?
AND I'M A MODERN GUY.
AND THE MODERN AGE
 IS UP IN THE AIR.
THAT'S WHERE I BELONG --
NOT DOWN HERE.
THEY ONLY WASHED YOU OUT
'CAUSE YOU'RE TOO BIG.
IT AIN'T YOUR FAULT.
I'LL CUT MY LEGS OFF.
IF YOU HAD TO SNEAK SOMETHING
OUT OF THE VILLAGE,
WHY DIDN'T YOU BRING SOMETHING
IN SKIRTS?
OH, I'M NOT --
Shh.
DON'T INTERRUPT
THE MUSIC.
LISTEN.
MURDER.
YAH!
THIS IS BERLIN
BRINGING YOU THE JIVE MUSIC
OF ARTIE SHAW.
THAT'S OUR SALLY.
NOTHING SWEETER OR HOTTER
IN THE WORLD, IS THERE?
REMIND YOU OF ROSALIND,
SYLVIA,
PHYLLIS,
NANCY,
MARY ELLEN,
DAISY?
YOU BET IT DOES.
SUMMER NIGHTS.
THE JUKEBOX DOWN THE ROAD.
COKES.
DOUBLE MALTS.
OH.
A GIRL'S SOFT LAUGHTER
IN THE MOONLIGHT.
TOMORROW, YOU BOYS
OF THE 18th INFANTRY
WILL MEET OUR ARMIES
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
ARMIES THAT HAVE BEATEN
THE WORLD --
THE FRENCH, THE BRITISH,
THE RUSSIANS.
WHAT CHANCE DO YOU STAND?
SAYS YOU!
WHEN WE GET THROUGH
WITH YOU GUYS, WAAAAAH!
WHY NOT BE SENSIBLE?
BE SENSIBLE AND SURRENDER.
OH, YEAH?
BE MY GUESTS IN GERMANY.
DANCE WITH OUR LOVELY GIRLS.
THEY KNOW HOW TO --
TO ENTERTAIN NICE, YOUNG MEN
LIKE YOU.
SAVE ONE FOR ME, SISTER!
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!
WHAT A VOICE.
WHAT A BEDROOM.
WHAT A...
I'LL NOW SING GERMANY'S
LATEST HIT,
WITH LYRICS WRITTEN ESPECIALLY
FOR MY HANDSOME
AMERICAN FRIENDS.
LIGHT FOR ME A CIGARETTE
IN THAT SMALL CAFé
WHERE WE MET
LET ME FEEL YOUR FINGERTIPS
LINDA, LINDA, ON MY LIPS
WHERE TWO LOVERS USED TO BE
ARE THEIR ECHOES
WAITING FOR ME?
AND DO YOU
STILL WAIT FOR ME, TOO?
AS LINDA, MY LOVE
I WAIT FOR YOU
THERE'S A PIECE OF FURNITURE...
I'D LOVE TO PUSH AROUND.
TURN THAT RADIO OFF!
IT WAS NAZI MUSIC.
NOW IT'S MINE --
OUR FIRST GERMAN PRISONER.
HEY, POP!
WHY WASN'T YOU BORN
A BEAUTIFUL DAME?
OR EVEN AN UGLY ONE?
OH, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
PIPE DOWN?!
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!
TONIGHT, BOYS...
TONIGHT, I DREAM
IN TECHNICOLOR.
HEY, HOW MUCH FURTHER
WE GOT TO GO?
ABOUT 20 MILES.
HOW FAR?
20 MILES.
THEN YOU GET OUT
AND WALK ANOTHER 10,
YOU KNOW, TO GET THE STIFFNESS
OUT OF YOU.
WHERE WE GOING, CHINA?
HEY, THAT'S OURS -- 105s.
THEIRS -- 88s.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
20 MILES.
THAT'S WHAT I SAID,
20 MILES.
PLANE!
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE HIM.
HEY, WHAT DID I TELL YOU GUYS
ABOUT THE AIR CORPS?!
THEY STINK!
LOOK AT 'EM SCRAM!
OH, THE YELLOW BELLIES!
ALL RIGHT, MEN,
IN THE TRUCK.
COME ON.
MAKE I SNAPPY.
THE MEDICS
WILL TAKE CARE OF HIM.
COME ON. COME ON.
ON THE DOUBLE.
FIRST DEATH'S
ALWAYS THE WORST.
I SUPPOSE SO.
ON THE DOUBLE, MEN.
LET'S GET IN.
I GUESS HE WON'T EVER
GET A LETTER
FROM THAT
BETTY GORDON DAME NOW.
THAT MAKES 'EM EVEN.
SHE WON'T GET NO MORE
FROM HIM NEITHER.
WHAT'S --
WHAT'S GAWKY'S
LAST NAME?
HENDERSON.
WELL, NOW THEY'RE GONNA
START BEATING OUR DOGS.
ALL RIGHT, COLUMN,
ADJUST THIS WAY.
COME ON, HERE.
WELL, MR. PYLE,
THIS IS THE END OF THE LINE.
WE'RE LIABLE TO RUN INTO TROUBLE
FROM HERE ON.
A COUPLE OF JEEPS
GOING BACK.
MIND IF I, UH,
GO ALL THE WAY?
WELL, IT'S YOUR FUNERAL.
ALL RIGHT.
FOLLOW ME, MEN!
IS THIS TRIP NECESSARY?
LIKE TO BE IN TULSA NOW.
YEAH, WE'RE GETTING
AMPHIBIOUS.
ALL RIGHT, MEN.
FALL OUT.
FALL OUT!
HEY, WHERE'S
THE LITTLE GUY?
POP?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, POP?
ERNIE.
ERNIE'S
A LITTLE WAY BACK.
HE'S OVER 38.
HE DON'T NEED
TO BE HERE.
BE HERE?!
 HE CAN EVEN GO HOME!
FALL IN!
HEY, HOW ABOUT GETTING MY NAME
IN THE PAPER?
HARRY FLETCHER,
ASHTABULA, OHIO.
WHAT'LL I SAY?
OH, ANYTHING,
JUST SO THE FOLKS BACK HOME
SEE MY NAME
IN THE PAPER.
HEY, ERNIE.
TELL CLEVELAND JOE McCLOSKEY'S
 WINNING THE WAR, SINGLE-HANDED.
WINNING THE WAR SINGLE-HANDED.
JOE McCLOSKEY, WHO MIXED SODAS
IN THE CORNER DRUGSTORE,
AND HARRY FLETCHER, WHO'D
 JUST HUNG OUT HIS LAW SHINGLE,
DANNY GOODMAN, WHO CHECKED
YOUR OIL IN THE SUMMER
AND STUDIED MEDICINE
IN THE FALL.
AND HERE THEY ARE,
WITH GUNS IN THEIR HANDS,
FACING A DEADLY ENEMY
 IN A STRANGE AND FARAWAY LAND.
THIS WAS THEIR BAPTISM OF FIRE.
IT WAS CHAOS INDEFINABLE,
GOING UP THE BRINK OF POSSIBLE
DEATH IN THE NIGHTTIME.
PUZZLED, AFRAID,
EACH BOY FACING THE WORST
MOMENT OF HIS LIFE ALONE.
IT WAS A BATTLE WITHOUT LETUP,
AND IT WAS GOING AGAINST US.
ONLY THING BETWEEN US AND THEM
IS WALKER'S GANG.
IT'S NOT MANY MEN.
YEAH, IT'S A LUCKY THING
THE KRAUTS DON'T KNOW IT YET.
STROBEL TO WALKER. OVER.
CAN'T SEEM TO REACH WALKER.
FIRST BATTALION.
YES, SIR.
I SEE.
NO, SIR. COLONEL HUNT ISN'T BACK
FROM RECONNAISSANCE YET.
WHO IS IT, RALPH?
CAPTAIN HORTON, SIR,
REPORTING FOUR OF HIS MORTARS
KNOCKED OUT.
HE'S PRETTY BADLY
SHOT UP.
TELL HIM TO PULL BACK
TO HILL 148 AND DIG IN.
RIGHT, SIR.
"D" COMPANY. HELLO.
HELLO.
"D" COMPANY. HELLO.
HELLO.
THEY DON'T ANSWER,
COLONEL.
KEEP TRYING.
RIGHT, SIR.
CORRESPONDENT.
PYLE.
HELLO. HELLO.
THEY'RE POURING MORE AND MORE
STRENGTH THROUGH THE PASS.
YEAH, AND DESPITE
ALL THE FAIRY STORIES,
ONE GOOD GREEN MAN CAN'T BEAT
 A SEASONED AND CRAFTY VETERAN,
ESPECIALLY
WHEN THE VETERANS
GOT MORE AND BETTER GUNS,
TANKS, PLANES.
ONE THING WE CAN DO
IS THROW IN BENSON'S TANK.
BENSON'S THROUGH.
THEY KNOCKED HIM OUT
WHEN THEY CAME THROUGH THE PASS.
WELL, THERE IT IS.
ALL WE GOT IN FRONT OF US IS
ROBERTS' AND WALKER'S OUTFITS.
"D" COMPANY.
A LITTLE MORE
THAN A COMPANY.
THERE'S SOME HOT COFFEE
AND BEANS ON THE FIRE, SIR.
NO, THANKS.
I THINK
I COULD USE SOME.
ME TOO.
"D" COMPANY.
HELLO, HELLO.
THEY DON'T ANSWER,
COLONEL.
OKAY.
HE'S BEGINNING
TO SPLIT THE PLATE.
HOW'S IT GOING,
WALKER?
WELL, WE'RE HOLDING OUT
OKAY, SIR.
OUR PHONE WENT DEAD.
CAPTAIN ROBERTS SENT ME UP
TO SEE IF THERE WAS...
WELL, IF THERE WAS ANY CHANGE
 IN PLANS OR...WHAT.
NO.
NO CHANGE YET.
BETTER STICK AROUND
FOR A WHILE.
HELLO, BILL.
HELLO, ERNIE.
COFFEE?
THANKS.
Day to Hunt.
Day to Hunt. Over.
HUNT TO DAY.
COME IN. OVER.
Withdrawing tanks.
Withdrawing tanks.
Position, Zebra-8-7.
Zebra-8-7.
Over and out.
FLEERS.
PUT THOSE PAPERS
IN THE FIREPLACE.
BURN 'EM, SIR?
NOT YET.
LIEUTENANT WALKER.
LIEUTENANT WALKER.
WHAT IS IT, SERGEANT?
LIEUTENANT WALKER.
GOT TO SEE
THE LIEUTENANT.
YEAH, HERE I AM,
WARNICKI.
NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT
IN MY LIFE.
NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT
IN MY LIFE, SIR.
SIR...
TAKE IT EASY.
TAKE IT EASY, BOY.
THEIR HEAVY TANKS...
OVERRAN OUR POSITION...
POINT-BLANK.
POINT-BLANK, SIR.
I HAD TO GET OUT.
GOT SOME OF THE MEN
BEHIND THE HILL.
DID THE BEST
I COULD, SIR.
DID THE BEST I COULD.
FLEERS,
BURN THE PAPERS.
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I EVER HAD TO PULL ANY OUTFIT
OUT OF ANYWHERE!
I WONDER WHEN WE'RE GONNA
START WINNING THIS WAR.
STROBEL, NOTIFY THE COMPANY
WE'RE PULLING OUT.
WE'LL SAVE WHAT WE CAN
FOR ANOTHER DAY.
ALL RIGHT, MEN,
ON YOUR FEET.
ALL RIGHT, MEN,
ON YOUR FEET!
HEY, FELLA.
COME ON.
HE'S DEAD.
SCRAM. SCRAM.
OVER AND OUT.
STROBEL TO JONES.
STROBEL TO JONES.
COME IN. OVER.
SCRAM. SCRAM.
OVER AND OUT.
AMERICAN BOYS BEATEN --
BEATEN BADLY.
ONE OF THE FEW TIMES
IN OUR HISTORY.
IT WAS A BITTER
AND HUMILIATING EXPERIENCE,
AND JOE McCLOSKEY WAS WONDERING
WHAT THE FOLKS BACK HOME
IN CLEVELAND
WERE THINKING OF HIM NOW.
AS WE LOOK BACK
ON THAT FIRST DEFEAT
AND THE BLOODY VICTORIES
WHICH FOLLOWED,
WE REALIZED
THAT ONLY BATTLE EXPERIENCE
COULD MAKE A COMBAT SOLDIER.
KILLING IS A ROUGH BUSINESS.
MEN LIVE ROUGH AND TALK ROUGH.
JIMMY O'BRIEN, 1918, STATE...
HI, ERNIE. THANKS FOR
PUTTING MY NAME IN THE PAPER.
YOU KNOW, I DREAMED
I GOT A COMMISSION.
SELLING WHAT?
HE IS MY BUDDY.
D-A-L-B-R-A-I-G-H-T.
I WAS A SHOE CLERK.
WAYCROSS, GEORGIA.
BEST OUTFIT
IN THE WHOLE ARMY.
ON A DULL DAY, YOU CAN ALWAYS
GET A FIGHT IN THE ARMY
BY ARGUING
WHICH IS THE BEST OUTFIT.
IN A YEAR, I'D BEEN
TO A LOT OF PLACES
AND LEARNED TO LOVE
A LOT OF MEN.
BUT I ALWAYS RESERVED
ONE SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART
FOR THE BOYS
THAT I'D STARTED WITH.
EVERYBODY ELSE HAD A COMPANY,
AND I FELT I HAD ONE, TOO --
COMPANY "C," 18th INFANTRY.
I HADN'T SEEN 'EM
IN A LONG TIME,
AND NOW I SET OUT
TO FIND THEM AGAIN.
THEY'D BEEN THROUGH A LOT
BY NOW --
THE CONQUEST OF SICILY,
 MURDEROUS LANDINGS IN SALERNO.
NOW THEY WERE PART OF THE FORCE
HAMMERING DOWN THE LONG,
HARD ROAD TO ROME.
HEY, DONDARO!
WHAT TOWN
DO WE TAKE TODAY?
SAN RAVIOLIO.
DIDN'T WE TAKE THAT
YESTERDAY?
NAH, THAT WAS
SAN SOMETHING-ELSE-IO.
AND I WAS WONDERING
ABOUT WINGLESS MURPHY,
SERGEANT WARNICKI,
LIEUTENANT BILL WALKER,
AND A FUNNY LITTLE MUTT
NAMED ARAB.
ALL RIGHT, MEN!
FALL OUT! CHOW UP!
FALL OUT!
YOU KNOW,
WHEN THIS WAR IS OVER,
I'M GONNA BUY ME A MAP
AND FIND OUT WHERE I'VE BEEN.
MAIL CALL!
LOPEZ!
YEAH!
WARNICKI!
DONDARO!
HEY!
I'M A FATHER!
WARNICKI.
WARNICKI!
THAT'S ME.
OH, YOU'RE LUCKY.
LETTERS
FOR CAPTAIN WALKER?
COME ON, SARGE!
SERGEANT!
YES, SIR.
ANYTHING THERE
FOR CAPTAIN WALKER?
SORRY, CAPTAIN.
NOTHING FOR YOU.
FLEERS!
WELL, LET'S GET THE REST
OF THIS STUFF GOING.
I'M EXCEPTING A LETTER.
AIN'T SHE PRETTY?
HEY, WHAT'S THIS?
YOUR INSURANCE FORM.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?
YOU FORGOT TO PUT IN
A BENEFICIARY'S NAME.
WHAT'S THAT?
ANYBODY WHOSE NAME
YOU PUT DOWN THERE
GETS THE 10,000 SIMOLEONS.
YOU MEAN ANYBODY WHOSE NAME
WHO I PUT DOWN GETS --
YEAH, AND YOU BETTER
PUT IT DOWN
BEFORE THE NEXT SHINDIG, BUB,
OR THERE WON'T BE NO DOUGH.
STICK YOUR OLD LADY'S NAME DOWN,
AND YOU'RE OKAY.
I AIN'T GOT NO OLD LADY.
WELL,
 YOUR OLD MAN, THEN.
AIN'T YOU GOT
NO RELATIVES?
WELL, STICK
 ANYBODY'S NAME DOWN.
YOU DON'T WANT TO LET
ALL THAT WOUGH GO TO DASTE --
DAY GO TO WOUGHS.
WHAT?
I SAID, "YOU DON'T WANT TO LET
ALL THAT DOUGH GO TO WASTE."
HEY, SARGE!
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?!
YESTERDAY,
I AIN'T WORTH A PLUG NICKEL,
AND TODAY I CAN THROW 10,000
BUCKS AWAY JUST LIKE THAT.
HEY, WHAT DO YOU GOT
IN THE PACKAGE?
SOMETHIN' TO EAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
WELL, OPEN IT.
HOW YOU GONNA FIND OUT
IF YOU DON'T OPEN IT?
THAT'S AN IDEA.
IT'S FROM THE OLD LADY!
LOOK WHAT SHE'S DONE.
SHE HAD THE KID'S VOICE PUT
ON A RECORD -- JUNIOR'S VOICE.
HE COULDN'T EVEN SAY "MAMA"
WHEN I LEFT HOME.
GEE WHIZ!
LET'S LISTEN TO IT.
AH, WHO'S GOT A PHONOGRAPH
AROUND HERE?
MAYBE THEY GOT ONE
IN THE NEXT TOWN.
YEAH!
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?!
LET'S GET GOING!
WHY DON'T YOU LOOK
WHERE YOU'RE GOING?!
GET OUT OF THAT JEEP,
AND I'LL BEAT YOUR BRAINS OUT!
I --
WHO YOU MAD AT?
HOW ARE YOU, WARNICKI?
WHY, IT'S ERNIE!
HEY, FELLAS,
 IT'S THE LITTLE GUY!
HOW YOU BEEN, ERN?
SEEN ANY DAMES?
YEAH, I BROUGHT YOU
A COUPLE, YEAH.
OH, GOOD, GOOD!
YOU'RE BACK, ERNIE.
I WANTED TO --
WHAT'S BEEN KEEPING YOU?
OH, I'VE BEEN --
WE'VE BEEN SAVING SUGAR
FOR YOU, ERNIE.
THANK YOU, PRIVATE.
AT LAST
I MET ERNIE PYLE.
NOW I CAN WRITE THE OLD MAN,
AND HE CAN RELAX.
WELL,
HERE WE GO AGAIN, ERNIE.
YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME YOU
SHOW UP, THERE'S A BIG BATTLE.
AND THE LAST TIME,
IT WAS TUNISIA.
YOU, UH, BETTER CHECK
YOUR DOG TAGS, FELLAS.
YEAH, THAT'S ME.
I GO AROUND STARTING WARS.
GOT TO MAKE A LIVING
SOMEHOW.
GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING
TO WRITE ABOUT.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING ELSE?
WHAT?
MY OLD MAN
SAYS I LOOK LIKE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU BOYS.
GLAD TO SEE YOU.
ALL RIGHT, MEN!
WE'RE MOVING OUT!
ERNIE, HOW ABOUT BORROWING
YOUR FINGERNAIL CLIPPERS?
HIYA, BILL.
HELLO, ERNIE.
I SEE YOU'RE GOING UP
IN THE WORLD.
OH, THESE?
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANKS.
IT'S BECAUSE
I SURVIVED LONGER
THAN THE OTHER LOOEYS,
I GUESS.
ALL RIGHT, SERGEANT.
LET'S GET THE MEN OUT OF HERE!
ALL RIGHT, MEN!
FOLLOW ME!
HIYA, WINGLESS.
HIYA, ERNIE.
HOW'S THE AIR CORPS?
AH, I'M AFRAID
THE BUDDY SYSTEM'S GOT ME.
ME TOO.
WELL,
YOU GOT AN OUTFIT NOW?
YOU BET YOUR LIFE
WE'VE GOT AN OUTFIT.
PRETTY TOUGH.
THEY ARE TOUGH.
THEY'RE KILLERS.
THEY BETTER BE.
PUSH IT RIGHT.
TOOLING AROUND
WITH THE INFANTRY'S
NO WAY TO REACH
A RIPE OLD AGE.
I'M GONNA BUILD ME A HIGHWAY
TO BERLIN OVER THOSE...
OKAY, COVER ME,
YOU GUYS.
I'LL GET 'EM.
WHERE'S
YOUR PLATOON?!
UP THE STREET!
LOOKS LIKE THIS ONE'S ON US.
OKAY. I'LL COVER YOU.
THE PROMISED LAND.
HIYA, BABE.
LISTEN, RAINBOW,
 EVEN IF I WAS DUMB,
I'D STILL
 SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE.
SI?
SI.
THERE'S THAT
WAR AGAIN.
SOUNDS LIKE
THEY'RE PAGING ME.
HONEST, RAINBOW, THIS HURTS ME
MORE THAN IT DOES YOU.
I'LL BE BACK.
DON'T WORRY.
OKAY? OKAY?
OKAY.
LET'S GO TO CHURCH,
WARNICKI!
OKAY, JUST A MINUTE.
YOU WAIT THERE, JUNIOR.
POP'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
LOUSY KRAUT SWINE!
LOUSY AMERIKANISCHE SCHWEIN!
LOUSY KRAUT SWINE!
THIS IS A FUNNY PLACE
 TO BE KILLING MEN IN, ISN'T IT?
VIVA AMERICANE!

VIVA ROOSEVELT-A!
AMERICANO CIGARETTE!
GIMME!

OH, YOU'RE G.I. JOE, HUH?
GIMME, G.I. JOE!
CIGARETTES NO BONO FOR KIDS.

IF THIS WAR DON'T KILL ME FIRST,
MY FEET WILL.
ME, I FEEL LIKE I'M 45.
I FEEL LIKE I WAS, TOO --
AND I DARN NEAR AM.
HOW OLD ARE YOU, ERNIE?
43.
I'M 26.
IF I KNEW I'D LIVE
TO BE 43,
I WOULDN'T HAVE A WORRY
IN THE WORLD.
OH, YES, YOU WOULD.
YOU'D BE JUST LIKE ME,
WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER
YOU'D GET TO BE 44.
HEY, GUYS,

DEARLY BELOVED,

IN THE SIGHT OF GOD
AND THIS COMPANY
TO JOIN TOGETHER THIS MAN AND
THIS WOMAN IN HOLY MATRIMONY.
WHO GIVETH THIS WOMAN
TO BE MARRIED TO THIS MAN?
WHO GIVETH THIS WOMAN
TO BE MARRIED TO THIS MAN?
I DO.
REPEAT AFTER ME.
I, ROBERT, TAKE THEE, ELIZABETH,
TO BE MY WEDDED WIFE...
I, ROBERT, TAKE THEE, ELIZABETH,

THOSE WHOM GOD
HATH JOINED TOGETHER...
LET NO MAN PUT ASUNDER!
HIT THE DIRT!
IT'LL TAKE A BETTER MAN
THAN THAT TO PUT US ASUNDER.
PROCESSION, HALT!
OKAY, KIDS.
IT'S ALL YOURS.
BOYS, HONESTLY...
THANKS.
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
LET'S GET GOING.
WHERE YOU BEEN?
GOOFING OFF, EH?
HEY, DONDARO.
TELL ME, DONDARO,
WHAT'S YOUR POWER OVER WOMEN?
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU GUYS?
YOU ALL LOOK TIRED.
GOOD MORNING, DEAR.
I DON'T LIKE IT.
IT'S TOO QUIET.
MAYBE THEY'VE PULLED BACK
 ALL THE WAY TO ROME.
AT THIS RATE, WE'LL BE IN ROME
IN THREE DAYS.
ALL RIGHT, MEN.
FALL OUT.
LOOK AT THAT OLD MONASTERY
UP THERE.
SO PEACEFUL.
YOU'D NEVER THINK
THERE WAS A WAR
WITHIN A THOUSAND MILES
OF IT.
OR A THOUSAND YEARS.
WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THE KRAUTS PULLING
ALL THE WAY BACK TO ROME.
I DON'T GET IT, THOUGH.
IF THEY WANTED
 TO SLUG IT OUT HERE,
THEY CAN MAKE IT
PLENTY TOUGH.
GET ME ARTILLERY
FIRE CONTROL.
HELLO, PETE?
THIS IS WALKER.
YOU KNOW THAT BUILDING
UP ON TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN?
THE MONASTERY?
YOU CALL IT THAT
IF YOU WANT TO,
BUT I CALL IT, IN MILITARY
TERMS, AN OBSERVATION POST.
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO GET US ALL KILLED,
YOU'D BETTER GIVE IT
THE BUSINESS.
CAN'T. GOT AN ORDER ABOUT IT --
RELIGIOUS SHRINE.
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE RELIGION
TO YOU?!
MEDIC!
ALL RIGHT, MEN!
LET'S GO!
LOST THREE.
I SUPPOSE
THIS COULD BE DEEPER.
YEAH,
KIND OF LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A PERMANENT HOME HERE.
YEAH.
PATROL, PATROL, PATROL.
ONE MORE PATROL,
AND I'LL GO NUTS!
PERSONALLY,
I'D FEEL A LOT HEALTHIER
IF THAT MONASTERY
WASN'T LOOKIN' DOWN MY THROAT.
JUST GOT BACK, CAPTAIN.
DREW A LOT OF SMALL ARMS FIRE
ON HILL 457.
MORTAR FIRE -- 793.
TERRIFIC ARTILLERY
BUT COULDN'T LOCATE IT.
THEY GOT LIEUTENANT JOSEPHS,
SPENCER, AND TRENTON.
MICHAELSON GOT IT IN THE ARM,
BUT I GOT HIM BACK OKAY.
OKAY, SERGEANT.
YOU'D BETTER GO GET SOME CHOW.
YOU TAKE OVER
JOSEPHS' PLATOON.
RIGHT, SIR.
IF LIEUTENANT JOSEPHS
HAD ANY PERSONAL BELONGINGS,
SEND 'EM OVER, WILL YOU?
OH, MY ACHING BACK.
SOMEBODY OUGHT TO PHONE
THE PLUMBER.
YOU KNOW, IT SOUNDS PRETTY SILLY
WHEN YOU SAY IT,
BUT SOMETIMES
RESTING LIKE THIS,
I GET A KICK
OUT OF JUST BREATHING.
HOT JAVA, STEVE?
NO.
THERE GOES
THAT MONASTERY AGAIN.
EVERYONE KNOWS IT'S BEING USED
FOR AN OBSERVATION POST.
WHY IN THE DEVIL
DON'T THEY BOMB IT?
I'M A CATHOLIC,
AND I SAY BOMB IT.
CHECK, BROTHER.
I GOT A WIFE AND A KID.
THINK I WANT TO DIE
FOR A PIECE OF STONE?
WHY WASN'T I BORN A 4-F
INSTEAD OF GOOD-LOOKING?
LIEUTENANT HAWKINS
REPORTING, SIR.
REPLACEMENTS.
YEAH,
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.
MAID'LL CLEAN IT UP LATER.
ALL RIGHT, SERGEANT.
LINE THE MEN UP.
ALL RIGHT, MEN.
FALL IN.
YOU FIRST FOUR,
FIRST PLATOON.
SERGEANT WARNICKI WILL SHOW YOU
TO YOUR HOTEL SUITES.
THE NEXT SIX,
SECOND PLATOON.
THE CORPORAL
WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU.
THE REST OF YOU,
GO WITH LIEUTENANT HAWKINS.
YOU TAKE OVER
LIEUTENANT HENRY'S PLATOON.
RIGHT PAST THAT MANSION AND DOWN
THE HILL, BUT TURN TO YOUR LEFT.
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ALL.
ANY OF YOU DOG-FACES KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT A PHONOGRAPH?
THE CREAM OF THE CROP
I ALWAYS GET.
HIT IT!
GEE, A GUY COULD GET KILLED
AROUND HERE.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S SYNCHRONIZE OUR WATCHES.
YOU STICK WITH
SERGEANT WARNICKI, LIEUTENANT.
HE KNOWS THE TERRAIN.
OKAY, MOVE 'EM OUT.
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.
SO LONG, ARAB.
GOOD LUCK.
MY POOR ACHING BACK.
BAD COLD.
OUR HERO!
OUR HERO!

B-BUT WE TRIED TO.
TRYING AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH!
EITHER YOU'LL GET

OKAY, GET ME 10 MEN.

THAT LITTLE REPAST,
WE GOT ONE CIGAR APIECE.

LET'S GO!
JESUS, LORD, AT THY BIRTH
WELL, THAT'S IT, BUDDY.

ALBUQUERQUE SUNSHINE.

OH, SOMEDAY, MAYBE.
WELL, IF YOU DO...

YOU MARRIED?
WELL, YES AND NO.
I WANTED ONE THING.
SHE WANTED ANOTHER.
SHE WALKED OUT.
CHAPTER CLOSED.
I DON'T KNOW.
NAMES.
I'VE BEEN PULLING OLD NAMES OUT,
PUTTING NEW NAMES IN.
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT
 THE ONLY WRITER IN THIS OUTFIT.
I'VE BEEN WRITING, TOO --
JONES...
PETERSON...
McCARTHY...
SPITOFSKY...
SMITH.
"DEAR MRS. SMITH, YOUR SON
DIED BRAVELY TODAY ON THE --
AND THE -- THE NEW KIDS
THAT COME UP.
THAT'S WHAT GETS YOU,
THE NEW ONES.
SOME OF THEM HAVE JUST GOT
A LITTLE FUZZ ON THEIR FACES.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S
ALL ABOUT, SCARED TO DEATH.
I KNOW IT AIN'T --
I KNOW IT AIN'T MY FAULT
THEY GET KILLED, BUT...
GET SO I FEEL
LIKE A MURDERER.
I HATE TO LOOK AT 'EM,
THE NEW KIDS.
HERE, DRINK UP, ERNIE.
HERE'S TO FAID PASS,
FILA BEACH, SALERNO, ORAN.
OHH, YEAH.
I'M TIRED.
WELL... YOU'D
BETTER TRY TO GET SOME SLEEP.
THAT REMINDS ME OF W.C. FIELDS'
SURE CURE FOR INSOMNIA.
"GET PLENTY OF SLEEP."
NAMES AND ADDRESSES.
AND THE HILLS
TO BE TAKEN.
YOU'D BE SIMPLY AMAZED
AT THE NUMBER OF HILLS
STILL TO BE TAKEN.
ERNIE, WHY THE DEVIL
DON'T YOU GO HOME?
I OFTEN ASK THAT MYSELF.
IF ONLY WE COULD
CREATE SOMETHING GOOD
OUT OF ALL THIS ENERGY...
AND ALL THESE MEN.
THEY'RE THE BEST, ERNIE.
THE BEST.
YEP.
WELL, IT'S A WORLD
THE OTHER WORLD NEVER KNOW.
EVEN THE AIR FORCE.
UP THERE,
THEY APPROACH DEATH DIFFERENTLY.
WHEN THEY DIE,
THEY'RE CLEAN-SHAVEN, WELL-FED.
IF THAT'S ANY COMFORT.
BUT THE G.I. --
WELL, HE LIVES SO MISERABLE
AND HE DIES SO MISERABLE,
YOU J--
DONDARO!
NICE TIME?
I ALWAYS LIKE TO SEE ONE
OF MY MEN GET SOME RELAXATION.
YOU KNOW, DONDARO,
IT'D GIVE ME A GREAT DEAL
OF PERSONAL PLEASURE
TO BREAK EVERY BONE
IN YOUR BODY!
GOOFING OFF DOWN THERE
WAS ONE THING!
UP HERE, IT'S ANOTHER!
NOW GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE I KICK THE --
WAIT!
REPORT
TO SERGEANT WARNICKI.
TELL HIM YOU'RE
GONNA DIG LATRINES
FOR EVERY MAN IN THIS COMPANY
FROM HERE TO ROME!
NICE DEEP ONES.
YOU'RE LUCKY, DONDARO!
YOU'RE LEARNING A TRADE!
WHEN THIS WAR IS OVER,
I'M GONNA WRITE A BOOK
EXPOSING THIS ARMY.
HEY, DONDARO?
TELL ME,
CONFIDENTIALLY...
WAS IT WORTH IT?
HEY, FELLAS! LOOK!
LOOK!
HERE THEY COME!
BOY, AIN'T THEY PRETTY?
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW.
OKAY, STEVE!
LET'S GO!
COME ON, MEN!
GENERAL EISENHOWER
HAD MADE HIS DECISION --
BOMB THE MONASTERY.
HE SAID, "IF WE MUST CHOOSE
"BETWEEN DESTROYING
A FAMOUS BUILDING
"AND SACRIFICING
OUR OWN MEN'S LIVES,
THEN OUR OWN MEN'S LIVES
COUNT INFINITELY MORE."
HERE WAS ONE OF THE GRIM
IRONIES OF WAR.
THE VERY RUBBLE
OF THE MONASTERY
BECAME A FORTRESS
FOR THE NAZIS,
AND THEY STOPPED US COLD.
WE WERE RIGHT BACK
WHERE WE STARTED FROM.
WARNICKI --
AIN'T HE BACK?
WE BETTER TAKE HIM
SOME COFFEE.
KEEP AN EYE
ON HIM, TOO.
WHEN WE GONNA
HIT 'EM AGAIN?
18:00.
COFFEE, CAPTAIN?
NO, THANKS.
IT'S HOT.
NO, THANKS, PETE.
TOUGH TIME
GETTING BACK, SIR.
WHAT KEPT YOU?
SHUT UP.
HELLO, STEVE.
SAY "HELLO" TO YOUR DADDY.
COME ON, JUNIOR.
HELLO, DADDY.
HELLO, DADDY.
I'LL KILL 'EM.
COME ON, JUNIOR.
COME ON.
I'LL KILL 'EM!
HELLO, DADDY.
HELLO, DADDY.
AND THEM...
HELLO, DADDY.
THEM!
HELLO, DADDY.
HELLO, DADDY.
IF IT WASN'T FOR THEM,
I'D BE HOME WITH JUNIOR.
HELLO, DADDY.
GOODBYE, STEVE.
I LOVE YOU.
I'D BE HOME
WITH LITTLE JUNIOR!
I'LL KILL EVERY MOTHER'S SON
OF THEM!
I'LL KILL THEM!
GRAB HIM!
LET ME AT 'EM!
I'LL KILL 'EM!
I'LL KILL EVERY ONE OF 'EM!
WARNICKI!
I'LL BLOODY KILL THEM!
WARNICKI!
I'LL KILL
EVERY ONE OF 'EM!
HELLO, DADDY.
HELLO, DADDY.
HELLO, DADDY.
HELLO.
TAKE HIM TO THE MEDICS.
GO ON, JUNIOR.
GO ON.
SAY "HELLO" TO DADDY.
HELLO, DADDY.
HELLO, DADDY.
ALL RIGHT, MEN.
LET'S DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.
THE MACHINES HAD DONE THEIR
BEST, AND IT WASN'T ENOUGH.
NOW CAME THE TIME,
AS IT COMES IN EVERY WAR,
WHEN THE GREATEST
FIGHTING MACHINE OF THEM ALL,
THE INFANTRY SOLDIER,
HAD TO GO IN AND SLUG IT OUT.
WHERE YOU FROM, JOE?
LOUISIANA.
LOUISIANA? GOOD.
CASSINO LOOKS A LOT BETTER
FROM THIS SIDE!
ALL AWAY TO ROME!
YEAH, I GOT A GOOD
TELEPHONE NUMBER THERE!
HEY, FELLA, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE THE 18th INFANTRY IS?
THIS IS IT.
"C" COMPANY?
WHAT'S LEFT OF IT.
HIYA, ERNIE.
HOWDY, LONG SHOT.
WHERE YOU BEEN, ERNIE?
OH, SPREADING IT AROUND.
HI, ERNIE.
HIYA.
WELCOME TO THIS SIDE
OF CASSINO, ERNIE.
FINALLY MADE IT, HUH?
GUYS MOVING UP THE ROAD
LOOK KIND OF CHIPPER,
DON'T THEY, ERNIE?
SURE DO.
WELL.
HI, ERNIE!
LONG TIME NO SEE.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
WE KICKED THE DOOR OPEN,
AND THOSE GUYS
MAKE THE GRAND ENTRANCE.
LET 'EM HAVE THEIR FUN.
THEY'RE STILL YOUNG.
GOT AN EXTRA CHAIR HERE?
OH, YEAH.
HAVE ONE, ERNIE.
GLAD TO SEE YOU, ERNIE.
THANKS.
HAVEN'T YOU EATEN
THAT DOG YET?
COME ON, FELLAS.
GIVE ME A HAND, WILL YA?
IT'S DONDARO.
It's the captain.
I'M SORRY, OLD MAN.
I SURE AM SORRY, SIR.
ALL RIGHT, MEN.
LET'S GO.
THAT IS OUR WAR,
AND WE WILL CARRY IT WITH US
AS WE GO FROM ONE BATTLEGROUND
TO ANOTHER
UNTIL IT'S ALL OVER.
WE WILL WIN.
I HOPE WE CAN REJOICE
WITH VICTORY BUT HUMBLY,
THAT ALL TOGETHER WE WILL TRY,
TRY OUT OF THE MEMORY
OF OUR ANGUISH
TO REASSEMBLE OUR BROKEN WORLD
INTO A PATTERN
SO FIRM AND SO FAIR
THAT ANOTHER GREAT WAR
CAN NEVER AGAIN BE POSSIBLE.
AND FOR THOSE
BENEATH THE WOODEN CROSSES,
THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO
EXCEPT PERHAPS TO PAUSE
AND MURMUR, "THANKS, PAL.
THANKS."
