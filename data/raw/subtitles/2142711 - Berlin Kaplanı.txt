-Ayhan! What are you doing, kid?
-He'll have you out ot the ring!
-I'm giving him punches on purpose.
So he thinks I'm done in.
He'll get a taste ot Tiger now!
The guy's pummelling you!
Don't let him near you.
Look, we're lucky.
You're taster.
A high lett guard,
then throw a right uppercut!
Keep away trom the ropes!
Got that?
-Yes.
-C'mon, kid. C'mon, Tiger.
-Go for it, my man.
You'll get a taste of Tiger.
Damn it!
21 wins in 50 tights.
-Don't get me started on sponsorship.
-lt was pure luck, Haci Abi.
I wrong-footed the guy.
I was all set to punch him...
...and the guy jumps.
So I get the counterpunch.
And so I go down.
The guy's a heavyweight.
-So what do you expect?
Seriously, Haci Abi
he was well prepared this time.
Shut it, Cemal.
It's you who got me into this.
Look, here are the numbers.
29 defeats in 50 fights.
15 knockouts. Get the picture?
Loss: 17,000 Euros.
Income: 0.
It's my tault.
I expected
top 10 stutf from a guy of 40.
Tell me I'm wrong.
I don't think I eat well.
-What?
I don't think I eat well.
Hey, you get five meals a day here!
Free kebabs all the way!
But it's all protein, Haci Abi.
No vitamins, no veggies.
All dead meat, Haci Abi.
I'll show you live meat then.
Shame on you!
Driving a man to murder
at this hour ot the day!
Now look.
Get going. And be back in a week
with my 17,000 Euros.
Whoever wants to sponsor you
can go right ahead.
17,000 Euros.
Now fuck oft!
Haci really got my back up,
Cemal Abi.
I'll beat the shit out of him one day.
We made him lose his bets too.
He has a point, kid.
So where do we tind 17,000 Euros?
Get to be champ again
yesterday, Rocky?
What was that?
Got a taste ot Arab hammer, huh?
What was that, asshole?
What was that?
Loser!
-See you in the ring.
-What's going on?
-Everything's cool. It's OK.
You'll get a taste of Tiger!
It's OK, kid. C'mon.
C'mon, over here.
Punch!
I'm just some dick's plaything.
-Punch, punch!
-That's what I've turned into.
I'm not happy about it either.

We'll take the service elevator.
You have so many fans.
-How do you like Germany?
-Nice.
-Yeah?
Can I take a photo ot us two?
-OK.
-Just a second.

Just in case.
My hand shook.
Thanks. That's great.
Can I ask you something?
Is Ahmet KK your real name?
I have a triend, you see.
He says... Ahmet OK Cool.
That's why you're Ahmet KK.
Ahmet OK Cool.
Funny, huh? I love it.
We're into jokes like that here.
I love jokes like that.
I'm also a bodyguard for Funda Arar.
I made a joke like that to her once.
So don't get upset.
Here's what I said to her.
Forget the German SS,
you're safe with Funda R-R.
Good, huh?
For God's sake!
-Where are you from originally?
-Kastamonu.
-Are you with Fatmagul?
-Are you security or paparazzi?
Just wondered. It's just
I see it on TV all the time.
I'm a boxer.
Can you sing that song of yours?
You know, Love is Far Away? I love it.
Sing a few lines, huh?
Please!
You're tar away now
Far trom houses
Drop oft your lD
At my mum's

Apprentice to life

I love it. Amazing!
Can we get that on video now?
Please!
Are we stuck?
Zero, do you hear me?
Zero, do you hear me?
Is no one coming up?
Zero? It's stuck.
Zero, do you hear me?
Hello? We're stuck, we're stuck.
The panic's coming on.
I can't breathe.
-How come?
C'mon, snap out ot it!
Hey, friend! C'mon!
What's going on with you?
Hey!
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!
You had a panic attack.
Have you had one betore?
I sometimes get like I can't breathe.
But I've had nothing like this.
Actually you know the cure, Ayhan.
The support ot your family
can help a lot with therapy.
Family? Nein.
I don't have a tamily.
My dad died in Turkey.
And my mum married again.
I don't speak to them.
Ayhan. Listen to the doctor, kid.
Listen to what, Cemal Abi?
The woman says I have the cure.
Like where?
She said contact your tamily, right?
Forget that.
How do we find Haci's money?
17,000 Euros.
-I've handled that.
How?
-There's a tight Friday.
-Yeah?
Haci says...
He says there's a boxer.
Ayhan should let him win, he says...
...then you can take your money
and we'll go our separate ways.
A match-rig? So I'm a journeyman, huh?
Cemal Abi, how can you tell me that?
Me, rig a fight?
Ayhan Kaplan rigs a tight?
-Don't we always get beaten?
-Yes, but...
He says you should tall in round tive
and we'll call it quits.
-What else would he say?
-No, I can't.
-No way can I rig a fight. Nein, nein!
-Ayhan, look. Your health's cracking up
you had a panic attack.
You got thrown out of the bar.
You're done with boxing.
Let the guy beat you.
It'll leave us with a few pennies.
We can open that sports school, huh?
We'll start a new life.
A new life!
Cemal Abi, what are you
getting me into here?
A new life, Pakize!
Please, Nurettin! Don't ruin
the peacetul lite we have here.
What peaceful life, huh?
We're slaves here!He's had me peeling onions
tor 20 years.
As if you're any better otf.
He has you check 15 rooms
to see it they're clean or not.
But he's my father. He gives us
a living, bless him. Don't say that.
OK, he's your father,
my father-in-law.
And yes, we depend on him.
But how can we refuse the ofter, Pakize?
The guy wants the land with the hotel.
He says he'll knock it down
and build a 5-star hotel.
He says we won't have to
worry about money ever again!
Look! It's like a chicken coop.
Take a look around. Do you see
any other guesthouses or camps lett?
There aren't any?
It's a sign ot the times.
Global capital, tourism.
The guys next door are raking it in!
It makes me crazy.
Please! Talk your dad round, Pakize.
Who else does he have but us?
I'm sure he'll say yes.
But how will it work?
It'll ruin our peaceful life.
What peaceful life?!
Tell him it's tor his grandson,
that we sell up, they knock it down...
...and we make a tortune.
The developer won't hang around.
-Now is our chance! Now!
-Nurettin!
What's that?
What?
The thing floating there.
Carrot.
Next to the carrot.
-Crap.
-Keep quiet.
My grandson's right.
Isn't that crap floating there?
Looks more like plastic, dad.
The wrapping trom the chicken.
Watch it!
Or it'll be murder by ladle!
How did it get in there?
Fatih, did you see how it got in there?
No!
Why are you asking the boy?
Is he the chet or you?
I won't give you a thrashing
in front ot the customers...
Shame on you!
Get a new pot made
by the time I'm back from prayers.
Grandpa, can I have money
to buy ice cream?
Come here, c'mon. Ot course!
My little young man.
Who could say no to you?
Block, block!
Hit. Hit now. Hit!
Hit!
-Block, block, block.
-Take it easy there, champ!
-Have fun!
-Welcome, Haci Abi.
Thanks.
Hello, Tiger.
-Hello.
-Hello.
So where are we at, Cemal?
Training.
We're good. Training, Haci Abi.
Ot course you should train.
It's your retirement fight.
Train away!
Training's important.
How are you, Haci Abi?
-Welcome.
-Thanks.
Here, let's go to my otfice.
-We can have cotfee.
-Why not?
-Let's go.
-Haci Abi!
-Yes?
-Who will I be fighting?
-Ayhan, it's on me. Enjoy.
-Thanks.
Is this some kind ot joke,
Cemal Abi?
What's this with Blondie?
I don't like surprises.
Drop the surprises, Cemal Abi.
Believe me, it was news to me too.
I'm not having that shit beat me.
Ayhan! We discussed this.
OK, but Blondie wasn't part of the deal.
Is Haci doing this on purpose?
Doesn't he know I hate the guy?
Hey, where's the great Ayhan Kaplan?
The Ayhan Kaplan who felled Canli Ibo?
Where's the Ayhan Kaplan crowned
90-plus junior champion back in '87?
Look on it all as business.
Don't get hung up about it.
The guy's writing otf our debt.
What's wrong with that?
You'll get knocked out one day.
Some way or other.
Someone will beat us!
I'm out ot here.
Don't drink too much.
You're training tomorrow.
Goal!
Get back!
Grandpa?
The doctor says
his memory's gone.
Yes. Concussion-related trauma.
Good. Good, Nurettin. OK.
Then bring me a full-size survey
ot the property.
-We'll go from there.
-OK, Tayyar Abi.
Now if we get a doctor's report,...
...can we get things rolling with that?
We have to ask the lawyer, sugar.
Bring a copy of the title deed too.
OK, Tayyar Abi.
Parcel 33, Tekirova.
A brick dwelling
on 12,000 sq m of land.
Yes. There are two owners.
-What?
-Two owners?
You have the wrong place.
Our place is owned by Sevki Kaplan.
Exactly! Sevki Kaplan has 50%
and Ayhan Kaplan 50%.
-lt says so here.
-Ayhan Kaplan?
Oh God, dad!
What did you do?
You drive me crazy!
We haven't seen Ayhan in 30 years.
He was a boy.
Did uncle leave it to him?
I don't see why he'd do that.
Dad, did you give Ayhan
halt this place?
The best canes are made in Safranbolu.
Mulberry wood.
Dear God!
Good old wrestler!
Betore the gendarmes show up, poww...
Dad, will another header tix him?
Quiet, son!
We have no choice
but to find that Ayhan!
Take it easy, Ayhan Abi.
Thanks, Musti.
Hey, Suleyman. Is that phone new?
Aha. It's awesome.
The battery lasts 5 days, you know?
Cool.
I saw it...
...but I didn't like the style.
I have a tight on tomorrow.
Come along.
We have exams.
I guess it's a no-no.
OK, tshuss!
-Tschuss!
Here, here!
That's it.
Thanks, Mr Kaplan.
You're welcome.
Mrs Schmidt, I can't
take the dogs out tomorrow.
I have a tight.
What? No!
Who'll take them out?
You should have told me betore!
Itwas a surprise.
I didn't plan on it either.
A surprise? It's a big problem, Ayhan!
It won't do!
-I'll find someone else.
-No! They're used to you.
OK, I'll come early. At 7.00.
-No. They're asleep then.
At 8.00?
-No. That's mealtime.
Please, keep to our agreement!
-OK, I'll be here at 10.00.
-At 10.00. Thanks.
-C'mon, treasures!
Even German dogs are precise.
Plan a surprise, if you want
to give a German heart failure.
Here!
Oh God, Cemal Abi!
Did my swan song have to be like this?
Chill!
You have skill.
Look at the fights we've won.
Look on it as business.
How, Cemal Abi?
Everyone will say I'm a tight tixer.
It pays our debt, what can we do?
You know Haci.
If we screw up, we'll get shot.
Crippled tor lite.
Ayhan, what's up?
Ayhan!
Snap out ot it.
What's up, Ayhan?
-The panic's coming on.
-What?
-Hey, what's up?
-Oh God!
-I can't breathe.
-What's up, Ayhan?
Ayhan!
Ayhan! Wait, kid! Wait!
You go about unclean?
You're unclean!
Speak, son. Don't be shy.
Sometimes...
-Huh? Sometimes?
Sometimes it just happens.
By itselt.
I wake in the morning
and the bed's all sticky.
The devil's doing.
Don't talk hot air!
You're a grown man, unmarried.
You have needs. It's normal.
Your body takes over. Anyway.
But hodja, I can't handle it.
It's like I'm a bad person.
But it's not me.
I mean, I wake up and it's happened.
I'm a sportsman anyway.
I can't fiddle even it I want.
My energy goes.
My advice to you is...
Take a shower.
Take a shower?
Yes, then perform a tull ablution...
...so you can chant
healing prayers.
Yes?
You understand?
-Yes. I take a shower.
-Then?
-Then I perform an ablution.
-Good.
Do as your doctor said as well
and we'll get over this all together.
Give me your blessing, Cemal Abi.
You've stood by me all these years.
You have it, Ayhan, my superhero.
Our new life begins today.
C'est la vie, the road ends here.
Stick out 5 rounds, OK?
Hey, OK. I fall in round 5.
I know.
Take this off.
I want a fair tight, OK?
Nothing below the belt.
I don't want to tall
out ot the ring again either.
-ls that clear?
-OK.
Let's see a handshake.
Left arm up! Good, nice.
Watch out, kid!
Break! Break!
Box!
Ayhan, are you OK, kid?
He's hitting like I'm a trash can.
You tall this round,
don't forget.
Watch out, don't get your head cut open.
C'mon, kid.
God damn it!
You pick just the fight
to pound the guy, Ayhan.
I didn't pound him, Cemal Abi.
It was the panic.
The panic came on and suddenly
the guy kind ot got bigger.
I gave it to him and he went down.
What do you expect?
If Haci catches us, we'll get
knuckle sandwiches and all the extras.
We'll come to grief by morning.
Come here!
Selam aleykum.
Hodja, we're putting you out big-time,
but we have nowhere else to go.
-We'll go first thing.
-No problem.
What can we do?
It'll be a squeeze.
Hodja, can I take a shower?
Come in.
Thanks, hodja.
Ayhan Kaplan?
Oh God!
Stop! Ayhan!
I'm your cousin.
Pakize's husband.
-I'm here trom Turkey.
-Turkey?
To our getting together!
The beer's good.
Takes the pain away.
-There's no pork in this, right?
-No.
Nurettin Abi, I'm really sorry.
I didn't recognize you,
that's why I whacked you.
Call me cousin, Ayhan!
It's OK, I realize that.
How would you know who I am?
But who did you think I was
to make you pounce like that?
Never mind that.
What are you doing in Germany?
Ayhan, kid.
Your Uncle Sevki..
-Has he died?
-No, but he's sick.
His memory's a bit, you know...
So Pakize and I said how it would be
if we had you to stay in Turkey?
It Sevki Abi saw you, it might help
jog his memory.
And make him happy too.
You're the only family we have left.
We'd make up for all those years apart.
But how did you find me?
-We phoned your mum.
-Hamburg?
-Yes. I asked her to come over too.
But she said she couldn't
with her husband's job.
-I don't speak to them.
-I know. You and your dad...
...I mean your stepdad,
you don't have a thing going.
-What?
-You aren't really bedfellows.
-I don't get it.
-It's a saying.
It you have a thing going,
you're bedtellows, that kind of thing.
I see! So if I love my neighbour...
...we have a thing going.
Otherwise it's like sex.Like I have
sex with my neighbour....
...and it's really good.
OK! What do you say, superhero?
It'll be a change tor you too.
Stay as long as you like.
Turkey, huh?
-Turkey.
Dad? Look, your nephew, Ayhan.
Recognize him?
-You know, Ayhan trom Germany.
-Perihan from Rome.
Uncle, I'm Ayhan.
Uncle Sevki, I'm Ayhan Kaplan.
Your nephew. Don't you remember me?
Look what I brought you.
Here, some chocolate.
It's good stuft. You'll like it.
You put the bread under the lamb.
The lamb juice is called sop.
You dunk the bread in the sop.
It you want some ot the meat too...
...tell Orhan. He'll cut you a bit.
It doesn't come forfree.
It needs a bit of time.
Fatih, you're back, son?
Put the ball down.
Look, your Uncle Ayhan's here.
What's this, cousin?
He's just like I was as a boy.
Unbelievable! Hey, you! Come here!
Go on, run.
Kiss your uncle's hand. Run!
Here, kiss this.
Wait, I didn't forget you either.
Look, here's something for you.
You can get that in Turkey.
Son, shame on you!
-I'll eat it then.
-I wouldn't. You're fat enough already.
-Don't be rude.
-And you're super-skinny, huh?
A footballer your shape?
You'd get mistaken tor the ball!
I'd say switch to the goal.
You'd make a good goalie.
Hey, what's up?
You hit a sore spot.
He gets mad being told to be goalie.
His triends always put him in goal.
Sorry, Ayhan.
That's the young generation for you.
All flab and no muscle.
Here, c'mon.
I'll take you to your room.C'mon.
OK.
-Pakize, he might eat it.
-Thanks. Welcome again.
Let's hope all goes well.
-So you're a boxer, Ayhan Bey.
-Yes.
You mean you tloat like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.
No, I go straight tor the sting.
I'm not into stepping around.
Can I say something?
Boxing's a really dangerous sport, right?
People die.
It you take a lot ot hits to the head
it's dangerous.
But you learn to watch out.
They wear helmets,
but I still say it's dangerous.
Right, but I'm a doorman at clubs.
And well, I tind that more dangerous.
-A doorman?
-Yes.
Security... That's tougher.
Can I say something, Abi?
The security guards at Mono Hotel
got stabbed last year.
God torbid. There's all kinds out there.
How do you know who's a killer?
Well, you sense it.
It a guy's up to no good...
...it he's carrying a gun or a knite,
he fidgets around.
He makes it obvious.
He doesn't stand still.
Let's say he suddenly knives you,
what do you do then?
God forbid!
-I use defence tactics.
Aikido, tull-contact.
Both are good.
Aikido's perfect, for example.
An awesome martial art.
The name comes from water in fact.
You're easy like the flow ot water.
You don't need to attack.
But you're strong as water.
You turn the guy's force against him.
It's like he's attacking himselt.
But I can't explain properly.
-I have to demonstrate.
-Oh, please do.
Please, I'm so curious.
A quick demo?
-Really?
-Yes, please.
OK. Any volunteers?
Mum, I think dad's scared.
Why would I be scared, punk?
It's only knives and stuft.
No, you don't need knives.
Even a spoon will do.
I just wanted to show the move.
-All right.
-OK. Get up.
Wait, don't take that.
It's greasy.
Ouch! That hurt!
Shit.
OK, wait, I'll...
Let's get some cold water on it.
Sorry, cousin.
You have to take every tactor into account.
But I didn't know about the soup.
It's tine. It'll be gone by tomorrow.
Nice one! You have to take
every factor into account, huh?
And here's the goose!
Whoa, what's this?
-ls he police?
-No, dad. It's Ayhan.
Your nephew.
You're amazing, Pakize!
Just look at that!
No place like home, huh, Ayhan?
Exactly. Where would you get
this in Germany?
What? There's no goose in Germany?
Sure there is. But only in tancy places.
You get it in expensive restaurants.
You have to book.
Plus it costs a tortune.
How could I do this in the micro
at home on my own?
It wouldn't work in the micro.
I do chicken breasts.
They take 5 minutes in the micro.
-Do you live alone?
Yes, I do.
A bachelor's life is the life, sugar.
Don't you teel sorry for yourselt.
You're saying let the microwave
get him all hot, huh, Tayyar Abi?
I say let's not cook his goose,
that's all!
It I tound that girl, I'd be happy
to cook the goose myself, Tayyar Abi.
C'mon! Don't let it get cold!
Ayhan, there's something
going on with you.
Elvan Hanim, you don't like the wing?
No, I'll take a tiny bit.
Hello? Can you hear me, Cemal Abi?
It's Ayhan.
Ayhan, where are you?
What's this number?
Have you dumped me and run back home?
No, I'll explain. Are you OK?
Not exactly.
Our debt's gone up to 50,000 Euros.
Haci pulled the trigger on me.
Find the money and come back.
We have a week. Otherwise he says
he'll shoot me in the other leg.
Ayhan, save me.
I'll get a mobile tomorrow
and call.
Let's not rack up a big bill here, OK?
OK, tschuss!
50,000 Euros...
Shit.
Let's string him along tor a tew days.
Keep him happy.
Then I'll sort him out.
I've made a plan ot course.
It'll ruin our peaceful life,
Nurettin.
Fatih has no time tor him either.
You saw, right trom the start.
He has no time tor anything
but that ball.
Now, listen caretully.
I'll say it one last time.
-I don't see your dad getting better.
-Ah, don't say that!
Be yourself, don't give anything away.
No blabbing about inheritance or shares.
This is our last chance.
Keep that in mind.
Let the guy feel like a king.
When the time's right
I'll tear down that kingdom!
-C'mon, get some sleep.
-Let's hope tor the best.
What more can we do?
Well, OK. Good night.
-Hey, what's going on? Chucky?
-They're calling you to breaktast.
Ayhan, have some pie.
OK, I gain weight here, it's a deal.
Everything's so good.
Ayhan, look. You remember
Vecdi Efendi?
-No.
-Hello. Welcome, Ayhan.
-Hello.
How would he remember?
He was 5 at the time, right?
I don't even remember Pakize.
That's so normal. We were both kids.
If I think about it...
...you and I tell into a vat of pickles once.
That's all I remember.
Ayhan, did you sleep well?
Yes. I watched a tilm and dozed otf.
Pakize, my hands are all sticky.
Can you grab some pie tor me?
It's paradise here.
I tell you, you live in paradise.
Right. It's always been
like a 5-star hotel here, Ayhan.
And hopefully we'll have a hotel...
What's going on?
Ouch! Nothing. A bee I expect.
I'll suck out the poison then.
-No, no need. I'm used to it.
They're always stinging me.
So what are you going to do today?
Cousin, you need to get me a handy.
-I left mine in Germany.
-Ah, a phone.
-I'll get you one when I go into Kemer.
-Thanks. But get a multitunctional one.
I mean one with messenger,
internet, wi-ti, the whole works.
I don't like the kind Fatih has.
They take good photos
but the battery runs out in no time.
What do they call it?
Hah, get me a smartphone.
OK, Ayhan. I'll get you a smart one.
Right! You can wander round
with Fatih today then!
-I'm busy.
-Busy with what?
A match.
Don't give me your match!
-OK, count me in on the match.
I want to play too.
I'll come with you.
-Morning, everyone!
-Morning, Elvan.
I brought you some orange jam.
-Hello, Ayhan.
-Hello, Elvan.
-Elvan, thanks a lot tor taking us.
-Hey, c'mon! It's nothing.
I was going into Kemer today anyway.
Fatih, how come the
match isn't here?
It's an away match.
Elvan, would you mind
driving a bit more caretully?
Why? Are you scared of cars, Ayhan Bey?
No, but everyone drives so dangerously.
-The roads are crazy too.
-Step on it, Elvan Abla!
Hey, you!
-Ah, there's a radar.
-What?
-A radar.
They flashed at us.
You warn each other about radars?
-Yes.
-So what's the point of radars?
I'd never thought ot it like that.
Can I ask you as your guest
to drive a bit more carefully?
-OK, Ayhan bey.
-Danke schon.
-Bitte schon.
-Bitte schon, huh?
Nice pronunciation.
You call it 'pronunciation'?
-Yes.
-Nice accent.
Thank you.
Why not hang out with us today?
You might get to learn German too.
-Warum nicht?
-Warum nicht? Exactly.
-Fatih, we're not playing.
-Don't be a cop-out!
You have a grown-up on your side.
We should have one too.
Ayhan Abi, how could you let that in?
You go in goal then!
-No way!
-Scheisse!
Hey, sorry, Ayhan.
Fatih, how could you miss that?
We're not counting that.
Your guy's massive.
The balls don't go in the goal.
How can you not count it?
We said at the start.
How come you played then?
-Plus you had Elvan Abla.
-No, no deal.
-Elvan Abla can't play anyway.
-Who can't play?
Ungratetul worm.
I played just tine.
I even scored a goal.
OK! Don't tight!
I'm going to give you a lesson.
You said, "OK, play" at the start.
Why? Because you took me for a loser.
I admit I'm big tor the goal.
But I'm not a loser, right?
So appearances can tool you.
From now on don't judge anyone
from the outside.
The colas are on me.
I'll get biscuits as well.
Hurray!
How does he do that?
Fatih, what relation
is Ayhan Abi to you?
My uncle.
He's a boxer, you know?
The German champion.
Here's the cola.
-Go on, ask.
-Ayhan abi, are you a boxer?
Yes.
Ayhan Abi's the German champion.
-What?
Fatih said.
He said, "My uncle's German champion."
He's right.
I'm German champion.
I was also champion at your age.
Won a belt in the 90-plus juniors.
C'mon, come and get your cola.
My uncle's a policeman.
My uncle's a doctor.
I don't have an uncle, but if I did,
he'd be a karate player tor sure.
It you're cold,
shall I close the windows?
Wow, nice joke!
Which one are you supposed to close?
-Very good.
-Thank you.
OK, let me ask you a joke.
What do you call an Arab CD?
-What?
-An El-CD.
You liked it, huh?
That joke's famous in Hamburg.
Bon appetit!
Welcome!
What's up? You seem a bit on edge.
A bit?!
I'm about to lose my mind!
-Here.
-What's this?
Ayhan Bey's smartphone.
I had to cough up
the price of a car for this.
So the smart ones are difterent.
Like with people.
The smart ones are something else.
Where is everyone?
-ln the garden.
-Why? It's working hours!
Can I have some melon?
We're out ot melon.
How about peaches instead?
-How come we're out of melon?
They're in the garden.
Our melons will be right along, miss.
Take it easy there, Ayhan.
-Hello, cousin.
Fatih, son?
You've ditched football
and started boxing, huh?
No, cousin. If I don't train,
I'll lose bulk.
-He's just hanging out with me.
-For tun, you mean.
With melons is it more umm...
I couldn't find any dumbbells.
But melons work. They're heavy.
Melons give you energy ot course.
Hey, nice joke!
Melons give you energy.
You can both eat them and...
Don't mind if I use that joke, do you?
I'll tell that one.
Ayhan, son? Is this OK?
Looks OK.
Yes.
Hold it at the back there.
Now watch.
Bend your knees. OK?
Lett guard up. Use your breath to hit.
Always use your breath.
Was that an earthquake?
Damn thugs, they're shooting again.
You won't catch the rabbits
without a light!
Ah, let's get dad out of there!
Pakize, we need rice.
It's too light.
-Rice?
-Bulgur is OK too.
Uncle, teach me more boxing, will you?
What's this about, kid?
Don't you want to be a footballer?
There's a boy at school
I want to beat up.
Scheisse.
Wuss! Boxing isn't about
beating guys up.
-Why do you do it then?
-It's my career, kid.
Have some patience. Tell your teacher
if the boy bugs you.
Do well and he'll get more upset.
You can't just belt
everyone you're mad at.
Boxing isn't about beating guys up.
It's a sport. OK?
He makes me sick.
I know what you mean.
There was someone who bugged me
when I was a kid too.
-What did you do?
-Beat him up.
But I regret it. I wouldn't now.
It's not right.
I mean, conscience is important.
Say two animals lay into each other,
they don't feel bad.
But people feel bad.
Do what you like in lite,
but keep a clean conscience.
Got that?
Keep a clean conscience.
That means you don't do anyone in
trom now on.
Is there nothing else at school,
girls and stutf?
There's a girl called Elif,
but she's really spoiled.
So what does she do?
Oof, she talks, gives me looks..
...and sometimes she makes fun ot me.
Girls are like that, Fatih.
She's playing hard to get.
Isn't Elvan Abla like that with you?
-What?
-I'd say she likes you, kid.
What way is that to speak to me?
I'm your uncle. 'Kid'?!
I'll tell Elvan Abla you like her.
I'll kill you.
One word and I'll kill you.
Hi! Come over!
Morning!
Say a word and I'll cut your willy oft,
I swear. Got that?
Now cool it.
What are you up to?
Watching the fish.
Fine, let's watch together then.
Yeah, yeah.
Elvan, you're showing me dreamland.
-That Chomera place is something else.
-lsn't it?
Flames coming out ot every rock.
The Chimera, yes.
It's where in mythology
Prometheus was thrown into the tire.
Do you like mythology?
Love it.
I watch Xena.
The mythology in that is great.
Hmm, they kind ot twist things around
in TV series...
...but you still get to learn something.
According to one legend
it's where fire was discovered.
-Really?
-Yes.
So the fire's there by itselt.
I mean, you don't have to, like,
do anything.
I agree.
It comes out like Zippo gas.
I'd say tire was
detinitely discovered there.
I love fire.
I have a real tire at home,
for example.
I get so into watching the fire,
I miss TV series and whatever.
I'm a fire person too.
I'm a tire sign. Leo.
-Really?
-Yes.
You can tell at first sight,
you know?
And I was thinking
what is it about this guy?
-Can you just...
-Face sideways?
Yes. Can you turn?
Yes, right. Detinitely.
You look like Johnny Depp.
-What?
-Like Johnny Depp.
No way!
His face is more angular.
No. I mean, the way you turn...
It has the same tire to it.
Did you see Pirates ot the Carribean?
Jack Sparrow.
Yes. He's great, I love him.
He has real class.
But I go more tor the octopus captain.
-Eww! Yuck!
-You will die!
The film couldn't happen without him.
Cheers.
This place has done me
a world of good, Elvan.
I swear to God
I came tor my uncle.
But for me this holiday's been
a breath of fresh air. It's been good.
Getting to know you has been
a breath of fresh air for me, Ayhan.
I have such a good time with you.
Can't you stay here
and not go back to Germany?
No. I have to go.
I have a life there too.
Besides, what do they say?
A good guest...
...doesn't outstay his welcome.
I should be a good guest.
I guess I'll leave sometime soon.
Are you going to
tell me about that fire?
Have you ever had a boyfriend?
Has your heart been on fire?
There was a guy in my first year
at high school.
-Yeah?
-Uh-huh.
Then he and my best friend...
Oh God, oof! Forget it. Here, c'mon.
-Prost.
-Right, cheers.
Looks like you'll learn German
and me Turkish.
OK, I'll teach you.
Wow, I'm super drunk.
I don't believe it.
They do that far-out thing.
I never get like this normally.
-You don't mind, do you?
-C'mon, are you crazy?
OK, good night.
-Bye. Tschuss.
-See you, good night.
-Good night, Captain Sparrow.
-Octopus Captain.
OK.
Oft you go then.
-Take care, OK?
-Sure. You're OK, aren't you?
Fine. Watch out for the dogs.
Don't squash them.
Or you'll get a taste ot Tiger!
Yeah. OK, goodbye now.
Scheisse.
C'mon, cousin! Who slaps
a lock on a couple of beers?
I don't look like Johnny Depp.
I don't look like him.
I'd make a good octopus captain.
Who on earth is it at this time?
Well I'll be damned.
Oh my God!
Cousin, it's me, Ayhan.
I want a beer but the tridge is locked.
Can I get the key?
OK.
Pakize, Elvan says hello.
Thanks.
Here, the key for the fridge.
-This one.
-Thanks.
Tschuss.
Vecdi Efendi?
-What's happened here?
-Ayhan Bey liked it better this way.
He was bored with the old set-up...
...thought a change would do us good.
But that's the limit!
-Where is he?
-With Sevki Bey, down at the shore.
I have a boat, she moors at the islands
Rain falls,
soaking her sails, my beloved
Ayhan! Come out!
Come out ot the water!
Dad can't swim. God forbid!
Why's that asshole turned up again?
We're coming!
Did the sea do him any good?
What did you talk about?
-Does he remember anything?
He still thinks I'm police.
Dad, Uncle Ayhan's taking me
to the trials tomorrow.
What trials?
You know, football school.
He's going to...
No. I've told you a million times.
Play with your triends.
-School's starting anyway.
-But dad...
I've said no a million times.
C'mon, cousin
what's the harm in sport?
What's the big deal? Let the boy play.
He'll be chasing the ball
more than doing sport.
Is that so bad? He has talent.
He might make a career out of it.
He's free now. Let him play.
All right... OK, then.
Thank your Uncle Ayhan.
Uncle Tiger!
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Stop it, son.
C'mon, eat your dinner.
So he's going in tor the trials.
Ah, Pakize!
Didn't you say
he should always get his way?
Ayhan should, yes.
But Fatih stirs things up.
What's wrong? It's only football.
There's no harm in it.
-Pakize, I spoke to Tayyar today.
-Well?
Are you ready
for what I'm about to say?
Go on.
This place is worth 1 million Euros.
A million Euros?
Shh! Quiet!
Are you OK?
You sure as hell deserve sex now!
Hey, hang on! Maniac!
God, sometimes you talk like a man.
Think what a million buys, Pakize.
A new life, a sweet lite.
If I don't find us the classiest
gated villa in lstanbul, call me...
-And it's Euros, right?
-Uh-huh.
We'll put a big chunk ot it
in the bank.
It'll get bigger and bigger there
all by itself.
We just have to
deal with that goat, Ayhan.
What's up?
I can't leave dad on his own.
He can come to lstanbul with us, huh?
For our own peace of mind.
Oh God...
-Where are you going?
-To lock up the restaurant.
OK.
Just trust me, Cemal Abi.
Abi, no one's rolling in it here.
How can I just say,
"Cousin, can you lend me 50,000 Euros?"
OK, I'll ask tor a loan.
But just trust me. Wait.
I'll handle it, don't worry.
I'll call you.
OK?
Tschuss, bye.
OK, tschuss.
We'll give you a loan, kid.
It's nothing.
-Get him to sign this, Nurettin.
-OK, Tayyar Abi.
And give him this too.
50,000 Euros.
Didn't you say he owed 50,000?
Give it to him, have him sign
and be over with it.
What's wrong?
Suppose we put in a bit more?
You know, as a kind of sweetener.
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
Faster. Move!
Pass to your teammate.
Pass!
To your teammate.
Play as a pair.
C'mon, boy, c'mon!
Get rid ot that curly head.
He plays on his own.
He won't pass to his damn teammates.
Murathan!
Derin, Derin.
-C'mon, c'mon!
Hey, triend.
When will he get to go on?
Let him warm up, Abi.
-But the game's halt over.
-Pass, pass to your teammate!
Boss, when will we give that kid a try?
Wait, now isn't the time. C'mon!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
Pass!
In pairs!
He's been warming up for hours.
Let him. Who is the kid anyway?
See that big guy?
The kid who's with him.
But he's really tat.
Where did you tind him for God's sake?
C'mon now, let's see you.
C'mon, boys!
-Selam aleykum. Got a minute, have you?
-Aleykum selam. Yes?
Coach, when's my boy going on?
Have him warm up.
Warm up? The boy's overheating.
What are you trying to do here?
Who the hell are you, man?
What do you want?
My name's Ayhan Kaplan.
I'm his uncle.
And it's me who paid for these trials.
What do you think you're doing?
If you did this in Germany...
...they'd tear up your licence.
Even in Munich they turn up
at your house and ask you along.
-Along to what?
-What?
Man, are you crazy?
What way is that to speak to me?
Yes, I'm crazy.
I get panic attacks.
Ah! Why aren't I panicking?
I used to get panic attacks.
Acute ones.
It telt like I was going crazy.
I did all this weird stutf.
But I haven't panicked once over here.
Maybe the boy's good for me?
Why aren't I panicking, coach?
It's great!
I do my ablutions, I take showers.
You think that's why? I don't get it.
An act ot God. I expect that's it.
Yes? It's great. I'm not panicking!
-Samet, get the boy on.
-I'm not panicking. It's great!
Alikan!
Fatih, go tor it.
-Go, Fatih. Weiter!
-C'mon, weiter, umm Fatih.
Coach, I'm not panicking.
Give me tive!
Hey, I'm not panicking.
Fatih, go Fatih.
C'mon! Go tor it, weiter!
Hey, what are you doing?
Fatih, what are you doing?
But no one's passing!
Get the ball yourselt.
You're not running!
Samet, get that weirdo otf the field.
Get him oft.
Who, me, boss?
Who do you think?
Look, I'll tell you
what makes you special.
You have Hamit Altintop's butt.
The same legs, the same thighs.
I'm the same.
I always get the power
tor my punches from my butt.
We're multi-power guys.
You're my nephew.
That makes you special.
Shoot the moment you see the goal,
even it it's far away.
Your kicks are really dangerous,
I know.
See the goal and shoot.
Got that?
What did I say?
Shoot trom wherever I see the goal.
Shoot from wherever you see it.
Go for it!
C'mon, superhero! C'mon!
Ayhan Abi, how about
we step oft the tield?
C'mon!
Goal!
Wunderbar!
Yeah! Goal! Goal!
Let's take the kid on.
Put his name down.
I have.
This is Fatih Altintop!
Yes!
Wunderbar!
How's your dad?
Is he doing any better?
No, honey.
I mean, he talks,
but it's all nonsense.
Hello.
Cousin, this boy is something else.
I reckon he'll be a footballer.
Well, let's not get into that now.
Dad, I got picked tor the team.
Hey, I don't believe it!
Listen, this is a special occasion.
I say we should celebrate.
I agree. We should celebrate.
Elvan, I saw on the internet.
They do rafting here.
Well, I'd love to know
what rafting is like.
Let's go rafting tomorrow. To celebrate,
plus it'll be tun tor Fatih.
OK, let's do it.
No, c'mon! That's crazy.
If we're going to celebrate
we can have a BBQ on the beach.
But we can have a BBQ any time.
I say ratting's a special occasion.
Ratting means action. Fun.
A laugh.
I say it'll be great.
Let's go rafting, mum. Please!
Look at you.
Making a scene right otf.
Fatih, son.
You've become totally spoiled.
Football's over, now it's rivers.
-Prefab.
-What's 'prefab'?
-He means 'hyperactive'.
-Oh right.
It only we hadn't brought dad!
What could we do, Pakize?
The man runs otf when he's on his own.
Ayhan, son. How about we get out
somewhere close?
You carry on.
-Mum, I think dad's scared.
-Why would I be scared, punk?
Hey, calm down. What's the big deal?
Besides, it's good for uncle.
Look, 80-year-old Germans
sail round the world on their own.
The stutf we're wearing
is super protective anyway.
Germans are super disciplined, right?
Listen, we should be pulling the oars
at the same time.
Listen to the instructor there.
What should we be doing, chief?
Guys, we're going into a rapid.
So let's row all together now.
Eins, zwei! Eins, zwei!
Yeah! Amazing.
Hey, it's amazing.
You really teel like you're alive!
Very nice!
Damn your bright ideas, Nurettin!
You brought this idiot
all the way trom Germany yourself!
-Ah! What a beautitul smell of sausage!
-That isn't sausage.
-Have you passed wind, Nurettin?
-Uh-huh. The rest is on its way.
Quiet or I'll rip otf your lite-jacket.
You'll sink like a stone.
-Keep it up with those poles!
-He says to stick our oars in!
I will, I will.
Old King Kong calls oars 'poles'.
Are you OK, old man?
Yes thanks, son.
Are you from Search & Rescue?
No, the ratting club medical team.
Are you OK?
Hello. Oh, thank God!
We were treaking out.
Fatih was shit scared.
-Are you guys OK?
-Yes, we're tine.
It was a change tor us.
We had tun.
Really?
Look, the instructor told us
to row together.
You heard him.
"Eins, zwei. Eins, zwei.
Tempo, tempo!"
But we don't keep tempo.
Yes, exactly.
Can I say something?
With sports like these
you have to work as a team.
The force ot the water is so amazing.
-Totally amazing. Multi-power.
I want to give it another go.
-C'mon. Let's do it again, huh?
Nein!
It was God making him say that.
Ayhan, what's up, kid?
You look troubled.
-Cousin...
-What's up, kid?
Well, there is something actually.
Can we talk man to man?
OK, sure. Go into the garden.
I'll be right there.
So you're about to rig a tight...
But God's up there. And the Lord says
don't rig tights, just punch away!
Shame on you!
Don't get mad. Just joking.
Now how much do you need?
It you can spare 50,000 Euros.
And a tew thousand tor me.
I swear I'll pay you back.
Shh, lad. None ot that!
God's smiling on you.
Forget owing us,
we'll soon be owing you.
What?
Ayhan, I only tound out myself
last week.
I didn't want to do your head in
when you were tired from travelling.
Ayhan, they want this place.
I don't get it.
Your dad thought of you before he died.
He left you a share of this land.
We only tound out
with your Uncle Sevki's illness.
Part of this place is yours!
You get it now?
No way!
It isn't worth a lot.
We've had a valuation done.
Your share comes out
at around 70,000 Euros.
-70,000 Euros?
-100,000 if I push it.
But I'd have to push it.
What's up?
Well, is it right to do this
while Uncle's still alive?
Your uncle won't get better, Ayhan.
We can't run the place like this.
Pakize and I thought
we'd sell the land...
...move to lstanbul and her dad
could carry on his treatment there.
Fatih would be happy too.
We'd sign him on at a big club.
He'd go to a good school etc.
-I don't like the idea, you know!
-Do we have any choice?
Life plays dirty sometimes, Ayhan.
Don't be like this for God's sake.
Look what happened to you.
You were all set to rig a fight.
This way is a solution tor everyone.
This place might make
around 200,000 Euros all told.
Peanuts...
But big money for us, right?
200,000 Euros is huge money.
I know, but...
Look, you know what we'll do?
You sign this power ot attorney.
I have some savings in the safe.
I'll give you those.
Go back to Germany
and bail yourself out.
I'll collect the rest and send it
bit by bit once you're back in Germany.
OK, cousin.
I guess there's no choice.
So this place will be sold?
That's too bad.
It means a new life, Ayhan.
We all have to pay the price of course.
-Do I sign here?
Thanks, cousin.
Let me go get the money
from the sate.
Hello, Cemal Abi?
Can you hear me?
-Where the hell are you, Ayhan?
-Wait. I have good news.
I've found the money.
I'll wire it tomorrow.
-Are you serious?
-Yeah. OK?
Talk about luck!
You know what happened today?
What?
I was at Haci Abi's place.
There's a championship on in Turkey.
He said if you go tor it
he'll write otf the debt.
Cemal Abi, I'm done with boxing.
I wouldn't fight for Haci anyway.
I've found the money,
I'll send it tomorrow, tinito.
OK. But give it a thought
just the same, kid.
OK, tschuss.
-Ayhan!
-Hey, Elvan.
-How's things?
-Good.
-Let' go. I came to take you away.
-Where?
-A surprise.
-A surprise?
Wow, classy music.
It's the sound of love.
-Mulberry vodka?
-Serve the lady first, will you?
Ot course.
Thanks.
Danke.
I'm so used to this place, you know.
How can I go back to Germany?
I'm used to Fatih,
to Nurettin, to Pakize.
To you.
You know how as a kid the holidays end,
school starts and you teel all sad?
That's just how I feel.
The holiday's over, school's starting.
Are you crying?
I feel really sad too.
I've got so used to you.
I've never had as good a time
with anyone as I have with you.
You're completely ditferent
and you really surprise me.
I don't want to lose the luxury
of being surprised, Ayhan.
No problem.
I know myself, Elvan.
That's why I've never had
a serious relationship betore.
My girlfriends have all done
ugly stuft...
...just to keep me.
-Jealousy is the worst.
-Exactly.
Being with me is an adventure, Elvan.
They want to smell the tlower
but then kill it trom overwatering.
That's so wrong...
That's so wrong.
It you want to keep hold ot a man,
you should always stand by him.
Jealousy doesn't solve anything.
Take me, for instance.
I...
I'm just giving this as an example.
It I married a boxer,
I'd go to every one of his fights.
Sure, support is crucial.
It's your husband, you must support him.
Elvan, now probably isn't the time, but...
...I guess I'm serious about you.
Me too, Ayhan.
Two people are serious about each other.
That's so wonderful.
Yes. Fantastic.
Ayhan, take me with you
wherever you're going.
You have a Schengen?
No.
A Schengen's crucial.
It's a no-no otherwise.
You need to get a Schengen.
Or I'll send a request to the embassy.
You take the papers along.
So you're in contact with me.
That would work,
or getting a Schengen yourself.
I think over here they ask for
a photo and a police record.
Plus you need a bank card.
They won't let you in without a Schengen.
Nein, nicht. A Schengen is crucial.
Thanks a lot for tonight, Elvan.
You're welcome.
-Maybe we shouldn't go any turther.
-I agree.
Some things should be left to time.
Let's not ruin that.
Yes.
Nice to meet you.
You too.
OK, I'm going.
-Good night.
-Good night. Drive caretully, huh?
It's happening, Ayhan.
It's happening.
The rain's over, the sun's rising.
You won't get one. I know you won't!
-Son, you're making a scene again.
-Fatih, aren't you asleep yet?
I told you we'll get one, promise.
Don't shout. Your dad will hear.
It you aren't getting me a bike,
why did you say you would?
What's going on?
Who's upsetting my nephew?
-Pakize, what does he want?
-A bicycle.
I've said OK, we'll get one,
but he's making a scene at this hour.
-I'll get you a bike.
-OK, you get me one.
You beast!
Son, I said I'd get you one.
It you'd had the money,
you'd have got one last year.
-You've been conning me the past year.
Shame on you, in tront of your uncle!
It's OK, we have money now,
thank God.
-Where?
This place is being sold.
I told you, son, didn't l?
I'll get you a whole bike factory then.
Oh yeah! Liar!
-Hey, speak properly to your mum!
-She's making it up.
You tell him, Ayhan. How many bikes
does 1 million Euros buy?
Now you're really making things up.
This place is worth 1 million Euros?
You mean it is?
God damn you, Pakize!
Cousin! You lied to me, cousin!
Open the door!
Cousin! Open up, we have to talk!
Ayhan, Pakize got it all wrong
when she said that.
You're lying! That's why
you came and got me trom Germany.
The whole thing's about money.
Why did you mess around with me?
What the hell am I doing here?
Open up!
You've got it coming!
It I don't thrash you all night
my name isn't Ayhan Kaplan!
You'll get a taste of Tiger!
King Kong will break down the door.
God help me!
Cousin?
That hurts!
Cousin? Cousin, are you OK?
Those were gunshots.
Sevki Bey, what are you doing
with that ritle?
Superb! A rabbit the size of a boar!
Go fetch the rabbit!
Nurettin! Ah, he's thrown a fit!
Oh my God!
It hurts!
Someone fired a gun.
What's up, Nurettin?
Everything OK?
Not exactly, Tayyar Bey.
Hand it over.
We're not selling the hotel.
I've given halt my share to Fatih.
He can do what he likes with it
when he's grown up.
That's a shame. A real shame, Ayhan.
It's because you don't live here, you...
Yeah? What are you saying?
What do you mean?
So what it I don't live here?
Does living in Germany make me stupid?
People are people wherever they are.
What kind of people are you?
I don't get it.
You're evil, all ot you.
And he's the worst.
He tells me he'll do well to get
100,000 tor a 1 million Euro place.
He'll send it bit by bit
after I'm gone.
Can I say something?
Abi, isn't that place worth 3 million?
Am I remembering wrong?
1 million is way too low
tor that place.
So you knew as well?
3 million? God damn you, Tayyar!
Nurettin Abi, please don't curse
in the otfice.
Hey, enough!
Nurettin's always the one to blame.
Look at the state of me!
Enough!
You know what I've had to sufter?
Forget sponging otf the in-laws,
I've been a slave there for 20 years.
The man's like some sultan,
he's never stopped ordering me around.
Nurettin, there's hair in the chicken.
Nurettin, there's rats in the room.
Nurettin, the cellar's flooded.
Mop it up.
Foul language in tront of everyone.
The match annoys him so he yells at me.
Father and daughter have played
piggy in the middle with me.
You'll tind my sweat, my patience
in every brick of that hotel.
Then the sultan gets sick one day.
Thank God! Nurettin will
tinally get to see better times.
But that doesn't happen. Why not?
Because Aladdin of Germany
springs out ot the magic lantern...
...and grabs a share of everything!
Is that tair?! Is that right?
Are you so honest? Weren't you going to
rig a fight to get rid of your debt?
Nein! I had no choice.
That wasn't my motive.
It isn't the same thing.
Lite gave me no choice either.
We wanted a new life, you know.
Just a new lite, Ayhan.
-You know who gets to me?
-What?
You made me one ot the tamily.
You made me a close triend.
I thought I was loved.
That's what gets to me.
You stung me like a scorpion.
OK, tschuss.
Ayhan, where are you going?
It's over, Elvan! You knew
and you didn't tell me.
I didn't know the hotel was yours.
Don't be ridiculous!
It you didn't know, how come
you know it's worth 3 million?
Maybe you did know,
that's why you got close.
I suspected something. What can I do?
I don't get it.
I'm going.
Are you going to take me swimming?
Take care, uncle.
-Hey, don't cry!
-Uncle, don't go.
I have to go.
Maybe when you grow up
you can come to Germany.
We'll go pick up girls together, huh?
I'll still be really lonely.
Don't forget, you have Hamit's butt.
Don't be scared. Go tor those balls!
Got that?
OK, tschuss.
Uncle.
Hello?... Cemal Abi?
I can't wire the money.
Does Haci's otfer still stand?
Faster!
-Abla, can we have some tempo here?
-That's as tast as it goes.

Are you still upset with me?
I'm really sorry.
Cemal told me about the problem,
that you got sick and things happened.
But you must understand me.
For some people,
50,000 Euros is a game of poker.
It's a lot tor you and me.
So it's worth it tor the money?
Isn't it tough on the guy?
There's no more to say.
I'm a lonesome emigre like you.
I have people on my back
wanting to break my wings too.
-Did you put money on it again?
-Yes. No choice.
May God be on your side.
-Our debt gets written oft today, huh?
-Yes! Whether we win or lose.
We're late. We won't make it.
Can't we go a bit taster, driver?
-No, we can't.
-What do you mean "no"?
That's some nerve! Ot course we can.
We're late.
Can't you see the traftic?
Where do you think I'm going?
Why do I always
land customers like this?
Step on it!
Cut the backchat.
Almighty God!
Keep away trom the ropes!
Ayhan, kid.
The guy's mangling you.
No sign ot a panic attack?
Nein, no panic.
God damn it!
C'mon, run! Run, son!
Just a second. Tickets please.
-We don't have tickets.
-You can't go in without tickets.
-We're Ayhan Kaplan's family.
-You have an invite?
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Do you have no shame, harassing me
in tront of my tamily?
-I'll sue you!
-Shame on you in tront of the boy!
Hey, are you still trying
to shut me up?
Run, run, run!
C'mon, quick!
Ayhan! Ayhan, dear!
Ayhan, please forgive us.
-Pakize?
-Forgive us, Ayhan.
-We're a family.
Cousin, what are you doing here?
Look, I made you some cheese pie.
Have a piece. It'll give you energy.
Take a bite.
-I can't now, Pakize.
-Eat it, Ayhan. It's been blessed.
How can l, cousin?
It's the middle ot a tight.
Ayhan.
I love you.
I love you too, but...
Thrash him, uncle!
-Miss, it you don't mind...
-OK, friend. Wait.
Take it easy. They're my family!
Security!
Look up! So the evil eye goes!
I'll pray for it to go! Look up!
Cemal Abi, you know why I always lose?
-Your weight.
-Nein.
I had nothing to fight for.
-But you do now, kid.
-Yeah.
Here's a new life.
In the palm ot your hand.
Go tor it, kid. Win this.
-Did you see my kid nephew?
-Yes.
-I'm going to fight for him.
-Do it.
You OK?
Ayhan Kaplan.
Ayhan Kaplan.
That boy's my nephew!
Why are our people on television?
Look! That's my late brother's son.
That's Ayhan Kaplan!
Call Nurettin.
Tell him to bring him back here.
Well I'll be damned!
Ayhan Kaplan.
Just like my brother.
I got you some twigs, Nurettin Abi.
Thanks, Tayyar.
C'mon, Nurettin. Hurry up.
We're starving here.
Cousin...
Don't cook my meat too long.
-I like it medium.
-OK, Ayhan.
You heard, right?
It has to be cooked medium. OK?
Grandpa? Uncle Ayhan should never go.
He should stay torever.
Of course, sonny. I tind my Tiger
atter years. You think I'd let him go?
-Right, Pakize?
-For sure, ot course.
I've sorted the Schengen.
You're coming.
Good old Orhan Kaplan!
Wrestler of wrestlers.
God rest your soul.
And a huge bon appetit to Ayhan Kaplan!

You have to feed me meat.
So you're a trainer.
