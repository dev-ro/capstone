Light a fire.
Fire it up.
Work it up.
Hey kids! How are you?
- All good?
- All good.
You didn't even greet me, Raees.
Got down straight to work, eh?
Salaam Aleikom!
Waleikom Asalaam!
Who gathered the most today?
We brought you the entire market.
First-class!
Hey, add some more chemical here.
Gujarat.
A State in Independent India
where every day is a 'dry day'.
Dry day means no
trading of liquor.
The penalty for selling liquor
is ten years imprisonment.
However, prohibition
begets rebellion.
Even today Gujarat is
considered a liquor-free State.
Yet, illegal liquor worth 250
billion is sold here every year.
This would've been impossible
if it weren't for Raees.
Take a bath, Raees.
From Umbergaon to Kutch,
the longest coastline of India
stretching 1600 kilometres
is part of our Gujarat.
Raees, you read.
Read!
Gujarat...
In the north of Gujarat...
Come here
I don't want to, but you
boys compel me to beat you.
Hush.
Read now.
D
P
- R.
- Very good.
Step down, son.
Nothing to worry, Aminaben.
Raees' eyesight is weak.
He just needs glasses
I hope it's not urgent...?
Ammi, I won't go to
school without glasses.
- Relax.
- Why?
Is it a new idea to bunk school?
For his weak eyesight,
the kid is quite sharp
I can't see what's written on the board.
Miss Ratna beats me.
What are you saying?
She hits my tiger?
How much will it cost?
Don't worry about
the money, Aminaben.
You can pay me later.
No, doctor. I don't want him
to have a borrowed vision,
but a clear one.
We'll get it done in a few days.
If I sense trouble,
I'll holler 'Bhaijaan'.
That's your cue.
Make it fast.
Bhaijaan!
Bhaijaan!
- Bhaijaan!
- Hey!
Who's there?
Are you stealing the spectacles?
Bhaijaan!
Are you stealing the glasses?
Stop, you thief! Hail Gandhiji!
Stop!
Idiot. Where did you
get this frame from?
- From Gandhiji.
- Gandhiji?
It won't work.
Nope.
Why don't you come tomorrow?
I'll make real glasses for you.
Go on
I have no money.
No money?
2 bucks fees is a must.
Rule is rule, no?
Take it and make the payment.
Problem solved.
Give me five!
Go on... hey, idiot.
Come back here.
Give Gandhiji back his frame.
He needs it more.
Go on.
It's awesome, Sadiq.
Just like binoculars!
Look! Gandhiji is smiling.
Qasim is cleaning the car.
Chakor is inflating the tyres.
Look! The cops are going
to raid Ilyas' liquor den.
Our business is in danger, Sadiq.
Let's hurry.
Jamil, clean it up.
Clear everything.
Boxes, bottles...
hide everything!
Leave nothing outside! Hurry up!
Quick!
- No one escapes!
- Salaam Aleikom.
- Spread out!
- Not again!
Find out where he's hidden the liquor!
Are you looking for some treasure?
Check the sacks!
There's nothing, sir.
Open it!
What are you looking for?
Hurry up! Search well.
Anything there?
You! Come here.
You like to whistle, eh?
Shall I make you whistle?
What say?
Hey!
- Why did you slap him?
- Ask him.
Ask him why I slapped him.
What's inside? What is it?
Goods. It's my business. Goods?
Or, is it fodder for riots?
Scum! It is a ruse for your
shady business, isn't it?
Scoundrel!
Being a cop is your job,
selling scrap is my business.
Get this loud and clear.
For us, no business is small.
And no faith is
greater than business
140 people died in Fatehpura last
night after drinking spurious liquor.
Ammi...
Police arrested Ilyas, a bootlegger.
Ammi...
The government has carried out raids
all over Gujarat in a move to wipe
out the illegal liquor business.
Is it true that no
business is small?
And no faith greater
than business?
It's true.
As long as it
doesn't harm anyone.
Get that?
Sleep.
Speak up, buddy.
What's the plan?
How do we earn now?
We'll sell liquor.
Fool. Ilyas is in jail.
Do you also plan to go?
The cops arrest those who sell
hooch, not imported liquor.
So?
We'll work for Jairaj Seth.
He sells imported liquor.
It's difficult, Amit.
But I'll give it one
last try for you.
Bye. Chandu!
What's the problem?
Seth, roadblocks are set up everywhere.
Delivery is impossible today.
Amit called thrice...
What if I deliver?
Who's he?
Both of them used to work for Ilyas.
Six bottles.
Can you deliver?
I'll take 3 bucks per bottle.
Hey, Foureyes.
- Are you trying to extort?
- Hey!
Don't you call me Four-eyes!
For those thick glasses,
what else do I call you, Four-eyes?
I told you not to call me Foureyes!
Freaking Four-eyes!
Deal
3 bucks per bottle.
Hey, give me the bottles.
Never call me Four-eyes!
Get that?
- Where to?
- I live here.
Show me your license.
It's at home.
Check his license.
- Want to check, sir?
- Beat it!
Employ the boy from tomorrow.
He's as shrewd as a merchant
and as fearless as a warrior.
Salaam, Seth.
Sadiq, the cops are causing
trouble at Narol Chowkdi.
Tell Raees to get the consignment cleared.
I'll see to it.
Down!
Up!
Down!
Up! What's so funny?
Here's your cut.
Release the stuff.
That settles it. Move it.
- Let it go!
- Well,
it isn't settled yet.
What's up, bro?
Come over here.
Your pockets were empty, I filled them.
Right.
You gave me a flat, now fix it.
That'll settle it.
- How can I fix it?
- Inflate it.
How can I?
Blow into it. C'mon!
Do it!
Be ethical in business.
It saves time and honour.
Blow it.
We unload his stuff, we
manage his warehouses
and he takes all the profit!
Get some onions.
How long are we to work
our tails off for Jairaj?
Let's set up our own business.
We are not cut out for business.
Enjoy the bird in hand.
We are Gujaratis. Business
runs in our blood.
In this business, we
need backing, not blood.
Not backing.
Guts.
You forgot Jairaj's words.
As fearless as a warrior,
as shrewd as a merchant
I've got it all
I'll win this one
too, Ujjwal bhai.
Take a look now, Ramnik bhai.
I'll go one more round blind.
I'll check mine.
Salaam Aleikom, Seth.
Salaam.
You bring me good luck, my Ace.
You're funny, Seth.
Not aces.
We're mere servants.
My tiger's not in the mood.
What's wrong?
Seth, I've been working
for years under you
I want to set up my
own business now.
Business, why?
I'll hike your salary.
Enjoy.
Sadiq, reason with him
I tried, Seth.
He's made up his mind.
He won't give up.
Really?
Come on.
- My boy has grown up.
- No, Seth.
He'll set up his own business.
It's not like that.
So you must've decided about
vendors and distribution.
You are here. How can I even
think of other vendors?
You know, in our business,
you have to spend money
like a drunken sailor
I hope you are cash rich?
What are you saying, Ramnik bhai?
Obviously, he has the money.
Sadiq?
He has the money, right?
How much stuff do you need?
Worth 400,000?
300,000?
200,000?
Raees, how much do I give you?
Seth...
just... worth 100,000.
Never mind.
Pay the money, take the stuff
Seth, I don't have the money now
I need some time.
Not even 100,000?
He doesn't have the money.
He needs time.
You have worked for me all these years...
I'll give it to you.
Three days.
Give me cash in three
days and take the stuff.
Fine?
72 hours.
Else, you get zilch!
Keep it.
The clock will keep ticking.
Your turn.
Why did you shoot
your mouth off?
If we don't pay up in three days,
Jairaj will destroy us, you know that.
Salaam Aleikom, Raees.
Waleikom Asalaam, Qasim bhai.
The car's a cracker!
It costs 100,000. Want to buy?
Forget it. This motorbike
is fine with me.
Try it once. It
rides like a plane!
Next time. Bye. Move it!
God keep you.
- Hey!
- Careful!
You'd have killed it!
Who will compensate for it?
Lallan, you idiot!
He's not even hurt!
What if he was hurt?
Would you pay me 500?
500 bucks?
I'll buy his entire
family for 500!
It's the time of Eid.
I bought it for 300.
It won't sell below 500 to 1000 here.
You know that?
Move it, Lallan.
Don't mess my brains!
Is he going to build
a castle out of it?
Hey... where do you
think you are going?
Where to? Tell me...
Raees, you're back so soon?
My mind just worked up a miracle.
Let's see what your car's got.
Sadiq, hop in.
Give me the keys, Qasim.
Take care. Drive only
till the square and back.
It's a car, not a date.
Relax. I'm leaving my
motorbike behind. Hop in.
Careful.
Raees.
Hey, speak up. What's the plan?
You bartered your motorbike for the
car, and now the car for the goats.
Are you setting up
a slaughterhouse?
As Lallan said, it's Eid.
People even pay 1000 for a goat.
1000?
Who will pay 1000
here in Fatehpura?
Not in Fatehpura but in Mumbai.
We're going to Mumbai?!
We have to pay 100,000 to Jairaj in
three days. Do you have a better plan?
Do you have one?
Ask him.
Excuse me. Where can
we set up shop?
- Over there.
- Up ahead.
- Herd them ahead.
- Move.
Over there.
Salaam Aleikom.
Waleikom Salaam.
Can we set up shop
in the corner?
- Whose goats are they?
- Mine.
Do you have the permission?
Permission...? No.
Where have you come from?
From Gujarat.
Pick up your goats and get lost.
Beat it.
We'll set up by the corner.
Hey! Don't you get it?
Brother, it's Eid.
We'll also make some money.
You'll have our blessings.
If we slaughter you along with
the goats, we'll be blessed.
Raees, it's not our territory. Come on.
Hey, Foureyes!
Can't you hear?
Get out of here!
Darn!
Foureyes needs a hearing-aid now!
Hey, Four-eyes!
Never call me Four-eyes!
Let's go. Musa is waiting.
Man is always accompanied
by an angel and the devil.
Anger is evil because
it's the devil's forte.
Your boys started it.
We were here to do business.
Your goats made
for great biryani.
What have you to sell now?
A goat is a lion's
prey, not business.
Well,
no business is small.
And no faith is greater
than any business.
My mother taught me.
My loss is great, and I have
little time to compensate
I have a right to
their blessings.
If you agree, we'll
take it and leave.
Come here.
Your glasses.
It'll help you see
the road ahead.
Musa bhai...
can we get a plate
of biryani to share?
We're hungry.
For all the festivities around,
we'll be observing a fast, darn it!
Forget Jairaj. How will
you repay mechanic Qasim?
What is it? Do we
look like clowns?
They made a circus out of us!
And here you are eating away!
The biryani is worth 100,000.
You should have some
I could eat a horse!
Well, you hardly took a beating.
You deserve a lesser share.
Stop kidding. They
crushed my stomach.
Ace, we have 3475 in all.
What do I do with it? Shall
I give it to Jairaj?
Or, repay Qasim?
Ice your wounds.
Creditors come knocking
even before we set up shop!
Darn, you followed us here?
Haji bhai sent me from
Mumbai, to talk business.
Let him in. Come on.
Tell me.
Reason for the favour?
Take Musa out
I hold nothing against Musa.
And we don't kill. Right?
Listen up.
If I wanted to take orders, I wouldn't
have set out to start a business.
Take the money and scoot.
Move it.
Musa sent it for you.
He told us to kill Musa, and
now he says he's Musa's man.
Who are you?
The name's Nawab.
I'm Musa's Man Friday.
You could've given it
to me in the train.
Sure.
But Musa likes to
test the waters.
Raees, don't take the money!
In trying to smite Jairaj, don't walk
into a deathtrap. - It's not a loan.
- It's for your goats.
- Raees!
Musa liked your philosophy
about business and faith.
Raees!
No one can harm those
who Musa favours.
What if we had agreed
to bump off Musa?
My left hand never
misses its mark.
Goodbye.
Raees!
What's up?
Jairaj Seth wants you. Your time is up.
Get back to work.
Tell Jairaj, I have stopped
dancing to his tunes.
My time starts now!
Ammi,
I'm going to start
my own business
God willing, I'll
make a lot of money.
But I will never let
anyone come to harm.
Pray for me.
Understand the business, Sadiq. We'll
buy stuff from Jairaj's vendors
and sell on the streets of Fatehpura.
That's great.
Cut the middlemen
like Jairaj out!
Here now, there now!
Life is a journey.
The city of my dreams
traverses, bundled in a bottle.
If you have the wisdom,
patience to boot,
and a lot of guts,
you have nothing to worry.
This world is fake.
You have to turn crooked
to fix it.
Follow your passions
push your will far enough,
and luck will shine on you.
It's the spirit of business.
It's the spirit of business.
It's the spirit of business.
Let me not take a step back.
Help me return the favours.
Repay, I must.
Let me not take a step back.
Help me return the favours.
Help me in my endeavour, Lord.
Help, Lord! May I never
break someone's heart.
Never
I don't care
how the world goes by
I just listen to the
call of my heart.
Everyone is answerable
in life or in death.
In the spirit of business!
In the spirit of business!
In the spirit of business!
In the spirit of business!
- Hi, Hasmukh bhai!
- How are you?
I'm fine. It's an awesome party!
Hang on.
Hey, gymnast!
Excuse me.
Who invited you here?
- Excuse me...
- Beat the drum!
Whose guest are you?
Mr Serpent?
Whose guest are you?
Excuse me. Whose guest are you?
Now, please don't
point that finger!
I am Hasmukh bhai's guest.
Whose guest are you?
I am Hasmukh bhai.
You are Hasmukh bhai?
Yes.
You are Hasmukh bhai?
That's me.
Your smile proves it.
- Is this your party?
- Of course.
So you're serving people hooch.
Hey, duffer!
This is not hooch. It's scotch.
It's scotch.
Party's over.
Attention.
We'll have to end
this party here.
But we'll surely continue the party
at Gandhinagar police station.
For your convenience, we've
organised transport. Fall in line.
A blue police van is waiting outside.
Remember, friends,
don't push around.
And ladies go first.
Have a safe journey to jail.
Thank you.
The last Mughal! You
will rot in jail!
Sir, the opposition will
certainly raise this issue.
Fix a meeting with Pasha.
I'll talk to him.
Sir.
What took you so long?
Sorry, sir. Bobby was
having breakfast.
Let him go
I can't. She's quite flirty.
Who are you talking about?
Bobby, my doggy.
Darn Bobby! I'm talking about
Hasmukh bhai and his party.
Sir, give me a paper.
Please, sir.
- What's this?
- Paper and pen
I can see that.
Give me in writing what you just said.
I'll release him right away.
What? In writing?
It's an order, Majmudar.
Release them.
Sir, my name is Jaideep
Ambalal Majmudar.
Ambalal is my late father.
Even if his spirit asks me to
release Hasmukh bhai and his party,
I'll take it in writing.
And you are merely...!
Give it in writing,
I'll release them.
You'll surely get it in writing.
Your transfer orders!
Get out.
Transfer him to Fatehpura.
He'll come to his senses.
Come on, bowl.
Bowl him out, Sadiq!
- Come on.
- You are out!
Shot!
Six!
Go, get the ball, Sadiq.
- Should I go? Sure?
- Forget it
I hit it, I'll get it.
Of course, you will go!
Freaking actor.
What's so funny?
Shut up!
No big deal. It's only a ball.
Her father will open the door
I bet. Aasiya will open it
God help him.
He hit bull's-eye.
- Ball?
- Yes.
Not again
I warned Sadiq not to hit
here but he is incorrigible.
He always hits sixers and
sends me to fetch the ball
I didn't. It was him.
Raees.
- The stairs.
- Where?
Ah, right where they are
I love you
I see no one but you around
I have so much to say.
Let me pour out my feelings now
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you.
Awesome!
Really?
Not you.
Actress Sridevi.
Why do you always
beat about the bush?
I can't help it. When you smile,
it strikes me dumb!
And I just feel
like watching you!
Then take me to Our World
God willing!
When I make Our World,
you will be the
first one to see it.
And yes,
you will have a say out there.
But my love will rule.
Amazing.
- My love, right?
- Nope.
Our World.
Will you be with me?
Always!
Devji.
Sir?
Sir.
Will you do me a favour?
Tell me, sir.
Will you get some soda,
ice and accompaniments?
- Sure, sir.
- Please.
- Listen.
- Yes, sir?
Forget it. It'll be difficult
for you to organise it
I got it. I will
organise it, sir.
What do you want?
Beer? Vodka? Rum? Whiskey?
Whose?
Jairaj's? Ramnik's? Ujjwal's?
Or... what's the name of
the guy with glasses?
- Raees?
- Right. Raees.
- Write.
- Sir.
What do I write, sir?
Resignation letter.
Write the locations of the liquor
depots or your resignation.
Write.
Sorry, sir.
- My mistake.
- Well, Devji,
one bottle won't
make a difference.
Get me an entire truckload.
Okay, sir.
Whose truck is it?
Jairaj Seth's consignment.
Kodnani has got his cut.
Sir, this truck is
loaded with liquor.
Park the truck.
You've got your truckload, sir.
Now?
Call the media. Let's party.
Sir!
Cards, darn it!
I've been nurturing the cops from
the lower ranks to the higher ups
for donkey's years.
Still, my stuff gets bulldozed.
Find out who did this!
Majmudar ruined Jairaj.
A sword seeks nothing but a head.
Majmudar has tasted blood.
It was Jairaj's stuff,
soon it will be ours.
Don't take him lightly. A
huge consignment is due.
Raees.
Inspector Majmudar
wants to see Raees.
You look different
in the picture, sir.
Well, they say I'm
quite photogenic.
You know whose
consignment it was?
Jairaj's.
You worked for him, didn't you?
I used to. I quit.
What do you do now?
Business.
What you call business
is actually crime.
- Come on, sir.
- Come on, sir!
Make two halves.
Go on.
We have information, sir.
Raees' truck is arriving from Kalol.
I see.
The truck number is GAF 1722.
Okay.
Oh.
Tea from a cop station.
Get used to it.
You'd better shut shop.
Or, I'll make it difficult
for you to even breathe.
The air of Gujarat is
replete with business.
You can stop me from breathing.
Can you stop the air?
At this rate,
you will soon run into trouble.
Get that?
Leave.
Thanks for the half teacup, sir.
Our truck won't arrive tomorrow.
But our consignment
will surely reach.
Consignment will arrive
without the truck. In what?
- In this.
- In a cup?
Assume that the teapot is the
truck and the cups are vehicles.
Once our truck is
on the highway,
Rasool will reach
with four vehicles.
We'll transfer the
stuff to our vehicles.
Then the vehicles will spread out and
enter the city via different routes.
And Majmudar will be left
waiting eagerly for the truck.
It's hot!
While we receive the delivery!
Stop!
Stop!
- Check the truck.
- Get in.
- Check inside.
- Open it!
Quick!
- Devji.
- Sir?
Tea time.
"Your beauty, mesmerising."
"The entire neighbourhood
is crazy for you."
Get lost, wastrels!
One slap will put
you in your place!
Oh, my!
At least she'll touch my cheek!
Father's down with cough again.
Salaam Aleikom, doctor.
Waleikom Asalaam.
Something's wrong with my eyes.
It's you! You forgot the rule?
It hurts badly.
Please examine me too.
Capital N and capital O.
- That means...?
- NO.
If you understand that, why
do you barge in every time?
Don't jump the queue.
Go, get out.
- Move.
- All right, I'll wait.
Go on, collect the medicines.
Okay.
And send the duffer in.
Yes, dear.
Here you are.
You are next.
Really?
At the doctor's, I mean.
Duffer.
Number.
Give him these pills after meals.
Thank you.
Hello, sir.
Who are they, Devji?
Petty criminals, sir.
They are out on parole.
They can be our informers.
Where did you pick up the groom from?
Sir,
I was picked up from the wedding
altar before I could...
Before I could even say 'I do.'
Sir, he is from Raees' area.
Send them away.
You come with me.
Get going.
Sir, I've done nothing
I swear, I didn't do anything.
Do you know Raees?
I don't know anyone, sir.
How does he do his business?
Sir, I really don't know anyone.
All I know is that I'm
getting married today.
Sir, the qadi is waiting. If
I don't get back on time,
he'll leave to perform other marriages.
What will you do outside...
when you know nothing?
Devji!
Revoke his parole!
Please don't send me to jail again!
Or, I'll be a
bachelor all my life!
Sir, at least let me get married.
Do you want to complete the rituals?
Yes, sir.
In that case, find out where
Raees hides his stuff.
- Do you agree?
- I do.
- Agree?
- I do, sir.
You are married! Off you go now.
Run before the qadi takes off.
Thank you, sir.
We have to band together to save
the business from Majmudar, Raees
I agree.
I'll be the chairman
of your syndicate.
Don't fly too high.
Or, you'll get cut.
If I was scared of getting cut,
I wouldn't fly kites.
I'd hold spools.
Gotcha!
He got him!
Raees, have you forgotten.
Jairaj's favours?
I remember the favours.
Right, Sadiq?
He had given us three days
I give you three weeks.
Think over it.
I'll be the chairman of the
syndicate, nevertheless.
Hang on.
Catch.
The clock will be ticking.
Pull!
You cut the wrong kite.
You goofed up!
Darn!
It soars higher and higher.
The heart soars higher
and higher like a kite.
It soars higher and higher.
The heart soars higher
and higher like a kite.
It's just a game, so to speak.
Yet, my heart takes flight like a kite,
whilst those eyes are as sharp as a string.
Tied to the kite is
a string's destiny.
It soars higher and higher.
The heart soars higher
and higher like a kite.
As the two hearts soar,
they unite high up in the skies
I had no idea
that the melody of your love
would stir my heartstrings.
Neither did I know
that you would traipse into
my heart and stay for ever.
Come rain or shine,
not a moment shall we stay apart.
Tied to the kite is
a string's destiny.
It soars higher and higher.
The heart soars higher
and higher like a kite.
This kite shall for
ever be with you.
It'll always be drawn to you.
As the two hearts soar,
they unite high up in the skies.
As the two hearts soar,
they unite high up in the skies.
Higher and higher, they soar
I do
I do.
Hello? It's me, sir. The groom.
Remember me?
Yes. Tell me
I have information about Raees.
Go on.
A huge consignment of Raees
is arriving tomorrow, sir.
If you bust it, he'll
be completely ruined.
Good.
All entry points to Gujarat are secured.
He can't breach it this time.
No one leaves his post
until his truck is found.
The swine will have to
come out to do business.
This time he's a goner.
Check those trucks.
Sadiq bhai, Majmudar has the whole
of Gujarat under surveillance.
It's impossible to pass through.
Let alone a truck, not
even a bottle can enter!
Majmudar is not going
to relax security soon.
The swine's dead set against us.
- Indore Highway?
- Blocked.
- Umbergaon?
- Closed.
- Udaipur?
- No chance at all.
We're in deep waters, Raees.
- Hey, turn around.
- No, Sadiq.
We won't drown.
We'll swim across.
As shrewd as a merchant,
as fearless as a warrior!
Get him out. Climb up and check.
Thanks for the help
I had heard
that Damla Seth rules the
seas, not the government
I witnessed it today.
I've heard lots about you, too.
It'll be fun to work together
God willing.
He shook hands with Damla.
If you want to save your business,
do something about Raees, Seth.
Tomorrow is Muharram.
He'll surely go to mourn.
Majmudar is here! I
hope there's no trouble.
Raees will handle it.
Move.
Do you know one Salim Shooter?
Well, he was murdered yesterday.
Did you notice? Or,
were you mourning?
Pass it on.
Kalupur goes.
That's Taufiq Talli.
Put some powder.
And there you go!
And there goes your cover...
Sadiq.
Your game's over.
You'll go in on
charges of murder.
Don't worry about evidence.
I'll dig it out anyway.
- Arrest them.
- Sir.
Bhai, the police picked up
Four-eyes in a murder case.
Whose murder?
Some Salim Shooter.
Is Raja with you?
Yes, he is.
Sir.
You'll have to release Raees.
Why?
He's confessing that he
killed Salim Shooter.
So?
He's surrendering. Arrest him.
It's in writing, Majmudar.
Arrest him.
Jai Hind!
May I ask you something?
How did you address your father?
Aunt!
Father. What else?
Hey!
What are you droning about father?
What is it?
Fine.
Try this.
What if someone
calls you father?
Aasiya, who's going
to call me father?
Hey! What are you doing?
Raees, I'll fall!
No! Raees, I'll fall!
Things will fall, Raees!
The phone's ringing!
Yes. Pick it up.
Here... pick it up.
- The phone!
- Yes, pick it up.
Here.
- Hello?
- Raees, Musa here.
Yes?
Jairaj hired the
assassin to kill you
I give you Jairaj.
O Laila.
They call me Laila.
Laila! That's me
I am
everyone's dream date.
They call me Laila.
Laila! That's me
I am
everyone's dream date.
If I clap my eyes upon someone,
he is sure to be bewitched.
He is completely floored.
That's me! Laila.
O Laila.
These moments
are so enchanting.
My eyes
are playing games with me.
You are here
I can't believe my eyes.
My heart
desires to feel you.
They call me Laila.
Laila! That's me
I am
everyone's dream date.
O Laila.
Laila.
O Laila.
O Laila.
They call you Laila.
That's you! Laila.
You are
everyone's dream date.
Sir, this is the beginning
of organised crime.
If Raees isn't stopped now,
he'll burn the whole of Gujarat.
After this terrible incident under your
jurisdiction, are you teaching me?
Now you give me in writing why I
shouldn't be transferring you!
You can transfer me anywhere
I won't spare Raees.
You can take that in writing!
I've committed a crime, Aasiya!
After I was transferred
out of Fatehpura,
Raees got an open field to play.
There was no stopping him.
Raids were out of question.
Because Raees would gift the police
a truckload of liquor every month.
This month's stock.
Convey our regards to Raees bhai.
Sure.
No more bulldozers.
Just cameras flashing.
Officers posed for the cameras
and made the front pages of
newspapers with 'seized' liquor.
The press, the police, the
government, all were a satisfied lot.
Raees has sent shirts for you.
See if the colour suits you.
It's perfect.
Bye.
There was one man who
could tilt the balance.
Salaam, Pasha bhai.
The leader of the opposition.
Raees wants to lend
colour to your life.
He sends a colour TV for you.
Wow.
But crafty as he was, Raees
won over everyone with cash
and consideration.
Raees, you know the
problem with the mill.
It can shut down anytime.
We women must work
to make ends meet.
Help us, Raees.
We want to buy sewing machines
and fend for ourselves.
But the banks aren't
giving us loans.
Can you make bags?
Bags?
That's not a big deal.
All right then, I will
give you sewing machines.
Let me also place the order
for 10,000 bags right away.
What will you do
with so many bags?
Buy groceries for Aasiya?
I'll do what postman Hari does.
Home delivery
God! So many phones!
Have you changed your business?
Are you selling phones now?
I'm not changing business.
These are for you.
Now don't you complain that
I keep the phone busy!
Liar!
The day you do this for
me, pigs will fly!
No, I'm serious, Missus.
From now on, Raees will be at
your service, round the clock.
All you have to do
is call and order.
Sadiq...?
He is flattering you.
He's come up with a novel idea.
Home delivery of liquor.
Hey, Sadiq! Why are
you lying to her?
It's the truth. Truth, my foot!
Wait till you get married!
You'll know, wives are a terror.
No, thanks. It's your problem.
Don't yell at him!
Talk to me.
He's fooling around. I was talking to you.
Why did he have to butt in?
Trying to flatter me, eh?
You think you are a charmer?
No. Sadiq...
To heck with Sadiq!
Sadiq, did you hear...?
Look at me.
What did you say? 'I did this
for you, I did that for you'.
You did nothing for me. Ass!
Freaking Four-eyes!
Scared you, didn't I?
A bit
I pine for you.
Don't torment me
more, O cruel one.
O cruel one
I'm drunk in your love.
Don't intoxicate me
more, O cruel one.
O cruel one.
Those eyes, mesmerising.
Your words, alluring
I fall head over heels for you
a hundred times over.
My heart
ceased to be mine,
ever since
I fell in love with you.
You are the one who
beats in my heart.
Don't stir the heartstrings
more, O cruel one.
O cruel one.
Come close to me.
Lend fragrance to my breath.
Please do.
Why should I alone
express my love?
Why don't you express it, too?
Please do.
You are going to
kill me some day,
Your defence indeed is deadly.
You are the beginning.
You are the end.
The story of my love
is all about you.
You are my leading light.
Until death do us part,
O my cruel lover.
O my cruel lover.
Faizan.
Faizan.
Jai Hind, sir!
Sir, sweets from Surat. It's
your favourite, isn't it?
What's up, Ramlal? You're
taking good care of me.
- Do you want leave?
- No, sir.
It's a boy, sir.
Congratulations! What
have you named him?
Faizan.
For a Hindu father, you give your
son a Muslim name. Secularist, eh!
Not I, sir. Raees
has become a father.
He has sent you an invite.
Make sure you reply to him.
Sir.
He has become a father of a boy,
not the father of the nation.
Give it back.
It's my favourite.
Remember those good old days? We
even stole Gandhiji's spectacles!
It was foolish, seriously.
Your signal saved me that day, too.
Else, he'd have thrashed me.
You say it was foolish but I did
it out of Miss Ratna's fear.
Fear? She was a terror!
Don't mention it to her now.
We're here to give her the invite.
She won't hit you for that.
How did this happen?
Debt took his life.
The mill shut down.
The owner even
refused compensation.
He's gone!
'So what if five labourers die?'
'You will employ
twenty-five more'
'to fill your coffers'.
- Bhimani Seth.
- What is it?
The labourers toiled for you for years.
You must give them
what is rightfully theirs.
If you want rights, go to court.
Why have you come here?
Get Deepak.
Debt-ridden workers are
killing themselves.
How will they pay
for court cases?
Did I tell them to die?
Think it over.
Done
I won't pay the labourers.
You take something and back off.
Before the movie ends, the
workers should get their money.
Else, it'll be the end of you.
Get that?
Place it here.
Salaam Aleikom, uncle.
Bless you, dear.
This is for Faizan, from
all the mill workers.
Salaam Aleikom.
Waleikom Asalaam.
Greetings.
Isn't it beautiful?
It's really very beautiful.
Why did you have to do this?
It's not a gift, son.
It's our blessings to you.
You helped us get our money
and saved our families.
This is the least we
could do for Faizan.
Thank you!
Jai Hind, sir.
Why are you moving the vehicle
from the crime scene?
If the highway isn't cleared,
there'll be a traffic snarl, sir.
We have to clear it, sir.
Where was the truck headed to?
Fatehpura, sir.
Empty truck?
It was loaded with
liquor, right?
Whose stuff was it?
Whose stuff?
Damla Seth's.
Stop pimping. Do your duty.
Get it?
- Get Damla.
- Sir.
Jai Hind, sir.
Sir, Damla Seth can't come.
Why not?
He's away in Fatehpura.
- You may go.
- Sir.
“Those drunken eyes”
“intoxicate me”.
The Chief Minister,
at Raees' party?
Mr Chief Minister!
Sir... sir...
Raees!
No politics today, please.
- How are you, sir?
- I'm fine.
Give him a break!
There's ice-cream for everyone, guys.
Okay, sir.
Raees, he is Mr Hasmukh.
He is into construction.
He executes all the
government projects
I wanted you to meet him.
You know Damla Seth.
- Aasiya, this is the CM.
- Hello.
Let's have a drink.
You drink like a fish here,
and in the parliament,
you take to sloganeering
'Ban liquor, save Gujarat'.
Not in vain, sir
I believe in political agenda.
I can see your political agenda.
Elections are approaching. Cut
the opposition crap and join me.
Mr CM!
The CM has bought a
property near Maninagar.
He has assigned me to construct a building.
Great.
But the hitch is, it's occupied.
Encroachers, you know. And...
he wants your company to
get the place vacated.
Can it be done?
Surely, if it's the CM's wish.
I'll take 30 percent.
Deal, Raees.
You are right, sir.
Damla is here with Raees.
The Chief Minister and
Pasha bhai are also here.
You quit the city but you
haven't forgotten Raees.
Can't help it.
Raees and I share a
strange relationship.
We can't be together,
yet he won't let me go away.
Cops! Run! It's a raid!
Stop.
Sit all of them up.
Get him.
Sit him up.
Bro!
It's the cops!
Prohibition Act, section 66 and 67!
You are going in for ten years.
Haul them in. Bhagat!
- Sir!
- Seize all the liquor.
- And seal the port.
- Sir!
Raees' lifeline and pipeline...
blow them out of the water!
Transfer Majmudar to some
godforsaken place, sir!
He is a constant pain in my neck.
He's a police officer, not a
pawn I can play around with.
He arrested Damla.
Majmudar has started
a fire in Kutch.
The flames could torch me
and eventually reach you.
If it isn't doused now,
everything will be razed.
Sir?
Type a transfer order.
Majmudar's?
Transfer him to the control room here.
He'll rot along with the old files.
Sir.
It happened, as usual.
An official order, enclosed!
And I left, with bag and baggage
India is always losing!
By transferring me to the control room,
they thought I'd be like a snake,
defanged and harmless.
But as they say,
it turned the tables!
Sir, we've got all the numbers
on Raees' home delivery lists.
Tap them.
Do you do home delivery?
Yes. How many bottles?
New stock, sir.
Two bottles, please.
Only ten bottles?
Order hundred, sir.
Involuntarily, Raees
pulled me closer to him.
From this spot, I could
hear his very heartbeat.
From this point to that,
200 acres of land has
been transferred to you.
You have made a huge investment.
Your dream to make a housing colony,
'Our World' has finally come true.
Raees bhai,
this is the right time to
start the construction.
Right.
Start right away then.
Fine.
Bye, sir.
Convey my regards to the CM.
Bye.
Did you hear about Pasha?
I know.
He's taking out a
procession to ban liquor.
The swine has gone crazy.
I'll fix him. Call him.
- Pasha here.
- Salaam, Pasha bhai.
A procession to ban liquor?
What's this new farce?
Oh, come on, Raees bhai.
Elections are at hand.
Besides, the liquor agenda
is my ticket to victory.
This gimmick is inevitable.
You know, Pasha,
your procession will
hamper my business.
Why don't we find a way out?
You find a way out, I'll
take the procession out.
The procession will start from the
party office and go up to Gotri.
Okay.
- Pasha here.
- At least,
change the route.
Don't lead it through my territory.
Impossible.
The road to my vote bank runs
through your neighbourhood.
Do as you please. The
procession will pass through.
What now?
Get this clear, Pasha.
If this procession takes off,
it will be your final journey.
How about some tea?
Did you send for me, sir?
Yes, Popat.
Hot news.
Before it cools down,
break it to the press.
'Raees issues an open threat'
'If Pasha takes out a procession,
it will be his final journey'.
You torched his castle, and
he has no idea what hit him!
Do it and watch the fun.
Right, sir.
And the circus begins!
'Raees' open threat: If Pasha takes out a
procession, it will be his final journey'.
- Hello?
- Are you crazy
to issue an open
challenge in the media?
I didn't speak to the press.
Pasha has dug his own grave
I told you not to make a fuss. Just
sell liquor. Leave politics to me.
Hang up!
Shutters down!
Keep your vehicles off the road!
The procession is coming this way.
Please maintain peace!
- Are you ready?
- Yes, we are!
Let's see who is man enough
to stop this procession!
Who is man enough?
It's the call of Gujarat!
Victory to Pasha bhai!
It's the call of Gujarat!
Victory to Pasha bhai!
Close the shops!
Deploy the barricades!
Keep people off!
The procession is passing
through Raees' neighbourhood.
- Situation under control.
- Copy.
Down with the government!
Down with the government!
Let's see who is man enough to
stop Pasha bhai's procession!
Let's see who is man enough!
It's the call of Gujarat!
Victory to Pasha bhai!
It's the call of Gujarat!
Victory to Pasha bhai!
It's the call of Gujarat!
Victory to Pasha bhai!
Down with the government!
Down with the government!
Let's see who is man enough to
stop Pasha bhai's procession!
Let's see who is man enough!
It's the call of Gujarat!
Victory to Pasha bhai!
To war!
Turn around!
Go!
Hack him!
Start shelling! Fire!
I warned you
not to pass through
my neighbourhood.
It hampers my business.
Now you know
who is man enough!
Who's the real man!
Who's the real man!
Swine!
Raees lived up to his challenge.
What action will you take now?
Look, we...
Swati Trivedi, Maha Gujarat Times.
Raees is your friend while
Pasha bhai is your rival.
Did Raees act on your orders?
Gujarat politics hasn't stooped so low.
The police are doing their job.
You don't let the police do their job.
Are Majmudar's frequent transfers
due to your proximity with Raees?
Raees will be in jail
within the next 24 hours.
- Is that a promise, Mr CM?
- Sir!
Yes? Go on.
Why should I go to jail?
Send Pasha to jail. He
created all the mess.
What about my business?
I'll give you all the
facilities in jail.
Do your business from jail.
Who stops you?
Oh, really?
I'll have you released
when you tell me.
It's only a matter of a few days.
Is that a promise?
I'm with you.
Don't worry.
- Salaam, bhai.
- Waleikom Asalaam.
- Hello? Who is it?
- It's me.
At this hour? Is all well?
I'm missing you.
Liar.
Listen. We made
22,000 in cash today.
That's not what I called you for
I told you, I'm missing you.
Really?
Really? Only 22,000? Darn it!
Freaking duffer!
Business meant life to you.
And finally, they traded you.
Pasha and the Chief Minister
have joined hands. Take a look.
'Coalition politics
completely wipes out Raees'
I told you
to get used to tea
at the cop station.
Get ready to contest
the elections.
Raees, politics is not meant for us.
I'm arranging bail for you.
The winds blow south, Sadiq.
To be free again, I
must win the elections.
Is it easy to win elections?
We'll need votes as well as cash.
You organise the cash.
I'll garner the votes.
Raees has done a
lot for the people.
We'll surely win the elections.
Listen carefully! He is Raees.
He's a class apart.
Love him, and he'd even
give up his life for you.
Act smart, and you'll
see the worst of him.
That's Raees.
That's Raees.
He's as fearless as a warrior
and as shrewd as a merchant.
As cool as a cucumber
yet as fierce as fire.
Right or wrong,
business is his faith.
Business is his first love.
That's Raees.
That's Raees.
He is Raees.
He's a class apart.
Bail granted.
Raees registers an historical
victory in Fatehpura.
None of his rivals could
even save his deposit.
That's Raees.
The name's Raees.
He is Raees.
He's a class apart
I told you, you'd be the first
to see Our World when I make it.
- I'll show you today.
- Really?
Look.
Over here.
In a straight line,
on both sides,
tall houses are standing.
Children are flying
kites on the roof.
The sky is enveloped with kites.
And...
over there... no,
right behind you,
there's an English-medium school.
Children are speaking
fluent English.
Good morning, Miss Ratna.
Here...
a hospital in
memory of my mother.
The Parsi doctor
will be in-charge.
I'm sure he'll still
charge only 2 bucks.
Aasiya, the air will be
rich with everything here.
There will be no
fear of starvation
or the curse of poverty.
The mornings will
be spent feasting
while the nights in celebration.
Amen.
Amen.
It's a fantastic scheme, Raees.
- Right, friends?
- Of course.
But the amount is too
big for all of us.
Qasim, who is asking
for the entire amount?
You don't need to pay
the entire amount now.
You have to pay only
half the amount.
And the rest in ten years.
You can pay in monthly instalments
for the next ten years.
Is ten years too short a period?
Don't worry, don't
be apprehensive
I guarantee you. This is my
neighbourhood, you are my people.
You own your house from
the very first day.
All of you will get the deeds of agreement.
I guarantee you that.
Your word is final. Let's do it.
'Our World'
'Our World'.
Salaam Aleikom.
Mr Majmudar! It's been so long.
Tell me. Are you here to meet
me or to conduct a raid?
Well, rest assured. Everything
is legal about Our World.
Liquor pays for the construction.
What could be more legal?
Luck favours you these days.
Days and nights are meant
for people, Mr Majmudar.
Lions rule for ages.
Try tea from Our World.
Come here, kid.
It might change your perception.
Cheers.
To me, you are still the same
I have changed a
bit, Mr Majmudar.
You can't tap this politician's phones now.
No, no
I don't need to listen
to your phones anymore.
I'm here as the Superintendant
of Police, Crime.
Trust me,
I had no hand in your
transfer this time.
Honestly
I know.
All your hands are tied.
That's why I came here
to reason with you.
Make sure you don't
give me an opportunity.
Never. I never gave you one.
Hang on, SP.
If you say, here, in Our World,
I'll book an apartment for you.
I'll book a place for you
in my world.
He won the elections yesterday, and
today he is building Our World.
Raees is going to be labelled a messiah!
Sir,
you have an urgent
call from Delhi.
Yes?
What?
- Turn on the TV.
- Sure.
Yes, sir?
In Uttar Pradesh, rioters
targeted a train
carrying passengers
returning from Hajj.
Several people are
being reported killed.
The incident has provoked communal
riots in many parts of the country.
Police have imposed indefinite
curfew in several districts
I don't want riots in my city.
You will handle Zone 1, Shambu.
Zone 2 is the most sensitive.
Majmudar, you will take charge there.
Sir.
Ten days of curfew has brought
the entire State to a standstill.
People have little access to
food, water, milk or medicines.
- Give this to aunt Laxmi.
- Sure.
Listen. This is
for Dulari's baby.
Deliver the bottle of
milk to her right away.
Distribute the meals
in police vans.
Raees sends food for all of you.
Raees! God bless you!
The children have been starving.
Easy.
Why don't you answer the calls?
Creditors are calling up.
The construction
guys and the grocers.
Why aren't the bottles
delivered yet?
Can't help it. No
orders due to curfew.
Don't mind this. But you must either
stop the construction work for some time
- or the free meals.
- No way.
- I can't do that.
- Sign here.
Stop free meals to the Hindu colony.
It'll ease the burden.
Hey!
Did you ever consider religion
while doing business?
None should starve to death.
Neither Hindu nor Muslim.
They are our people.
Neither the free meals will stop
nor the construction of Our World.
I'll organise the money.
Stop the meals, my foot!
Mr CM, I agree you have
the riots under control.
You must control Raees now.
His Our World is becoming
everyone's world.
It will be no one's!
Those who are buying Raees'
dream will soon grab his throat.
I'll make a pauper out
of that king in a trice!
I'm putting that site
in the green zone.
How much money do we have?
About 200,000.
That's all?
Have you swallowed the rest?
What are you saying, Raees?
Don't interfere!
I'm talking business here.
He should have the accounts.
Tell me.
- What?
- Give me the accounts.
You want accounts?
Accounts of what? The money
spent on the elections?
Or, the money spent on acres
of land for Our World?
Since the last three weeks, we've been
distributing free meals to four colonies.
It doesn't come for free!
I swallowed it? He's
asking me the accounts!
Don't you yell at me!
Are you doing me a favour
by giving me the details?
I've been noticing. You get
worked up over every little thing.
What is wrong with you?
He isn't annoyed over the
money but over the CM.
The CM put our land
in the green zone.
So what?
The deeds are in our names, right?
He changed the law.
No construction can be done there.
Only farming.
What happens to Our World?
People's houses, money...?
The money's gone!
Everything has
fallen apart, Aasiya.
How can it fall apart
just like that?
There must be a way.
Think. Talk to the CM.
He might understand...
Cut the crap!
No need to use your brains
I don't need anyone's advice!
Go on, get back to work.
Go!
What good is yelling? Will
it get our money back?
Or, will it help
build the colony?
To heck with the colony!
Hey! Raees!
- Stop it, Raees!
- Shut her up!
Move, Sadiq.
Raees.
Tell everyone the truth.
Or, assure them that
everything will be fine.
It will be.
For God's sake...
For God's sake, leave me alone!
That's it!
Aasiya.
At the crossroads
of life and death,
I find myself today!
O Destiny, I thought
you were a friend.
And I walked on,
in your footsteps,
latching on to you,
holding you dear!
Yet, you compelled me
to do things I'd never
have done otherwise!
We could never understand
each other
I'm tired, Aasiya!
Salaam, Raees bhai.
Waleikom Salaam.
Bhai,
Four-eyes is here.
He's up to his neck in debt
I know.
Nawab, what about
our Doha delivery?
The cops are very active, bhai.
Haji, Ejaz, Hari bhai,
everyone has refused.
Let Raees in.
- Send him in.
- Go on.
- Salaam Aleikom, bhai.
- Tell me.
Can I help you?
I need a small loan, bhai.
In fact, you need a huge amount.
Trust me, bhai.
I'll repay it, with
double the interest
I can't give you a loan.
But I can put you
on to something...
What about the Doha assignment?
Bhai, it's final.
Ejaz is delivering it.
Stop him.
The boys are already en route...
Don't worry, I'll handle him.
Put Raees on it.
Bhai, listen to me...
Let Raees do the job.
Gold is arriving from Doha,
to be delivered in Mumbai.
I'll do it.
The riots are over but the
curfew is still forced.
- How can we deliver it?
- Sadiq,
if we can avoid curfew and reach
Mumbai, so can the gold. We can do it.
Think over it. If
you can do it, fine.
Ejaz is on it anyway.
No, we'll do it.
- Sure?
- Sure.
Give him the money.
Thank you, bhai.
Sir!
What's this?
I hope it's not drugs.
- No.
- Nope.
It's only the packaging.
You have all the gold there.
- Is the gold there?
- Yes.
Let it pass then.
Bhairu!
Inform Raees that his truck has left.
Okay, sir.
Will it be tea or booze?
Booze... in a teacup!
No one's losing his money
on Our World, Sadiq.
We'll repay everyone
God willing!
Today, in a series of
explosions, five blasts
rocked three metropolitan
cities of North India.
People were hauling the injured to
the hospital in cars and scooters.
That's when we realised the
intensity of the blasts.
We can identify the body
only if it is intact,
not if it is blown to pieces.
A wave of fright and anger
has swept the entire country.
No organisation has taken
responsibility for the blasts yet.
The explosions are
linked to Gujarat.
The explosive used was smuggled
in through the waters of Gujarat
I have no idea, sir.
I'm just a driver!
All I do is deliver the goods.
Where did you pick
up the stuff from?
From Porbandar, sir
I know nothing, sir!
Whose stuff was it?
Damla Seth and Nawab
smuggled it in.
On whose orders?
Raees'
Hello?
It's a terrible messup, Raees.
The packaging materials with
Musa's gold weren't plastic.
They were RDX bombs, darn it!
Bombs?
How can they be bombs?
If they were bombs, couldn't
the officer detect them?
RDX is a new type of bomb.
They were used for
these explosions.
The swine Musa betrayed us!
Raees, this time the cops won't
arrest us, they will shoot us down!
Get out of there. See
you when I see you.
Good God!
God!
I had no idea what I was doing!
Raees.
Raees.
In trying to save my people,
I've burned down the
entire city, Aasiya!
Good God!
I've burned down the city!
Run! Run!
There are no eyewitnesses to
place Raees on the port, sir.
Damla shot himself, while
Nawab is absconding.
We can never prove it in court.
Let the court do its job, Majmudar.
You go and arrest him.
He's a master at destroying evidence.
Last time he was jailed,
he came out a politician. God
knows what he'll try this time.
Even I want Raees, sir.
To maintain peace, war
is a must this time, sir
I can't give what you
seek in writing, Majmudar.
Let's go.
Who wants it in writing anyway?
The cops will be here any moment.
Run, Raees!
I won't run.
I'm not a coward, Sadiq!
I'm not!
You are innocent. And to
prove that, you should live.
If you don't escape,
they will...
kill you!
Sadiq is right.
- Get out of here, please!
- No!
If I escape, the cops will
make life miserable for you.
Reason with her, Sadiq.
Take Faizan and Aasiya
to Sanjanwala's.
Now. Right now!
You know that it's the
only safest place for them.
- And you?
- You know that, Sadiq.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Don't argue with me!
Period!
Aasiya, trust me.
I'll fix everything.
But right now, this is
the right thing to do.
But...
I won't run
I don't know, sir!
You can break our bodies
but not our resolve!
Pick up the swine's family!
We are innocent!
Please let us go!
Find each one of them!
Where's Raees?
Thrash all of them
till you find Raees!
He's my brother!
I'll charge all of you under
the Terrorist Act! - Raees...
was our only support
during our bad times!
Raees is here.
Send him in. And listen.
Take his gun.
Okay.
What news?
Raees has gone underground.
But Sadiq is at Sanjanwala's.
Find Raees. Yes, Devji?
We found Nawab.
- Make preparations.
- Sir.
- Now!
- Listen up!
You betrayed me, Musa.
You made me smuggle in
bombs in the name of gold.
You have done a noble deed. You
will be blessed with heaven.
Killing innocents doesn't
lead one to heaven, Musa.
Raees, listen to me.
I'm going to Doha.
Come with me. We'll
be safe out there.
I'm going nowhere.
I'm not letting anyone go either.
Kill Foureyes!
Raees!
Innocents were killed, Musa.
My principles were laid
to waste in no time.
I'm a businessman.
But I don't trade in religion.
One last thing.
Never call me Four-eyes!
- Hello?
- Doctor,
let me speak to Sadiq.
It's Raees.
Sadiq here.
I've set everything right, Sadiq.
Are you folks all right?
We are fine.
Are the cops there?
No... Bhaijaan!
Okay.
I'm coming.
Come, Bhaijaan.
Who called? It was Raees, right?
Why did you call
him here, Sadiq?
What are you going
to do with Raees?
I just want to chat with him.
Take her away.
He is a businessman, sir.
He never betrayed anyone.
Do not be unfair to
him, Mr Majmudar!
- Devji...
- Sir?
- Shoot him at sight.
- Sir!
One bad decision has brought
upon a great calamity!
But I won't let
anyone come to harm.
They are innocent
I alone am at fault.
Pray that we meet soon.
I'm coming, Ammi.
Sir, a van is headed
towards the doctor's house.
How many people are in the van?
No idea.
Is Raees inside?
It's hard to see.
Target all the doors of the van.
Shoot on suspicion.
It could be Raees' ploy.
The van stopped at the gate.
Brace up for every situation.
Anything can happen.
- He is getting off, sir.
- Shoot!
I'll answer my superiors. Shoot!
Raees is not alone, sir!
He's brought the press along!
What?
Yes, sir. A van full of reporters.
Shall I shoot, sir?
Hold your fire!
I repeat, hold your fire.
No one shoots!
Guns down!
Back off!
Fall back!
Fall back, will you?
Hold them back.
Move it!
Bhaijaan, eh!
Hold them back.
Enough of the adoration!
Let's go.
- Take care.
- Take him away.
When you knew how this was
going to end for you,
why did you return?
Would you have spared
my people if I didn't?
I had to return to save
my flesh and blood.
But what you are about
to do, Mr Majmudar...!
Well?
What happened?
You don't trust the
system anymore?
Or, yourself?
Both, perhaps.
Can you live with my blood
on your hands, Mr Majmudar?
Give these to my wife
and tell her the truth
I promised her
that I won't run
I feel
this is the perfect distance
to shoot, Mr Majmudar.
What say?
Turn around, Raees.
Not in the back.
Shoot me in the front, sir
I can. You know that.
Shoot.
Is it true that no
business is small?
And no faith greater
than business?
It's true.
As long as it
doesn't harm anyone.
Bhaijaan!
What if someone
calls you father?
The mornings will be spent feasting
while the nights in celebration.
Amen.
In trying to save my people,
I've burned down
the entire city!
I'm not sure if I was
right or wrong then.
But Raees' question rings
in my ears even today.
Can you live with my blood
on your hands, Mr Majmudar?
