Ñandú means...
- Spider.
And káva means... wasp.
Voyeur!
Voyeur!
Malemba,
who's the voyeur?
Voyeur!
We need the boy to confess.
And that you find a way
to dismiss all the charges.
He's not talking.
To free oneself of one's position,
one must first take care of it.
I say this for you and everyone else here.
He won't talk.
May I?
- Please.
Good morning.
Ventura Prieto, assistant to the magistrate.
You can go.
There will be no punishment.
No punishment.
You can go.
Not without a statement.
Guard,
show this good man the way out.
There's a fish...
There's... a fish...
You're still under oath.
There's a fish
that spends its life
swimming to and fro.
Fighting water
that seeks to cast it upon dry land.
Because the water rejects it.
The water doesn't want it.
These long-suffering fish,
so attached to the element that repels them,
devote all their energies
to remaining in place.
You'll never find them
in the central part of the river,
but always near the banks.
Fernández.
"My lady, my Marta,
I write to you with concern.
For 14 months,
I've waited for news of you and my children."
The Governor told me
it won't be long before my departure.
The Governor assured me
it won't be long before my departure.
What do you want?
Message for Diego de Zama.
- That's me.
They're expecting you at Getaway Beach.
Who's expecting me?
- A man.
I need you to speak to the Minister, Diego.
I don't want those leeches embarking my ship.
Your relationship with the Treasury Minister
is good?
Everyone here is willing to do business,
Indalecio.
No payments for over a year.
We have to unload the Oriental's brandy.
He's made a fortune in Montevideo.
Now he wants to expand his business upriver.
Did Marta give you a letter for me?
Marta is making many sacrifices, Diego.
Taking care of your children.
They're growing.
Did you see her... often?
My friend, the Oriental!
A man who has seen the future from Montevideo!
I'm grateful that you're willing to help us,
don Diego.
If you excuse me, I'll now retire to rest.
Do we need an armed escort?
They warned us about a "Vicuña."
- Vicuña is dead!
He was killed 1000 times.
Don't worry. You're in good hands now.
Go and rest.
The Oriental's son.
During the voyage,
I told him who don Diego de Zama was.
The magistrate don Diego de Zama.
A god who was born old
and can't die.
His loneliness is atrocious.
Are you talking to me?
Don Diego de Zama,
vigorous,
in charge.
The pacifier of Indians.
He who did justice without drawing his sword.
It's not Zama who hides behind obligations
without surprises or risks.
Zama the corregidor.
A corregidor with the spirit of justice.
A man of law.
A judge.
A man without fear.
Good evening.
Your shirt?
There's no one, don Diego.
Rita.
Are you hurt?
There's nothing to fear.
Who goes there?
What's happening?
Did they rob you, don Diego?
Was there a robbery?
- No, I arrived just in time.
It's the dead boy.
Was it a fair-skinned boy?
No. Maybe. I was here.
Diego...
I fear for my daughters.
They're my treasure,
magnificent women.
Every night since my wife died,
I brush their hair.
I fear for them.
Sometimes, I get up.
I go to their rooms,
I fix the mosquito nets, I close the windows...
Vicuña and his men break into houses
and pass their days raping women.
He will return tomorrow...
Diego,
I fear for my daughters.
Vicuña and his men break into houses
and spend days raping women.
Vicuña has been executed.
There's nothing to fear.
He said he will return tomorrow night.
Don Diego de Zama!
Sit here.
Don Ventura Prieto!
Ladies...
Doña Luciana Piñares de Luenga!
Help me with this, it's poorly fitted.
It's tight here.
Good afternoon.
The mulattas are here.
Won't you help yourself, don Diego?
No.
You prefer white girls.
Yes.
You amaze me with such an exclusive preference.
Were you robbed at the inn?
Did they rob you?
Did they?
- No, I intervened.
Who was it?
- I don't know.
Seems there was a scuffle in your room last night?
Did they hurt you?
Your landlord's daughter was at the market.
She was very nervous about Vicuña Porto.
It appears Don Diego faced Vicuña!
Your friend the Oriental,
he might have cholera.
There've been other cases.
Should I send for Doctor Palos?
- No, I'm already aware.
To honor the visit of
Señora Luciana Piñares de Luenga,
our beloved Luciana,
she'll hand out the ribbons to the winner.
Let's head to the gallery.
You can sit wherever you feel most at ease.
In my case, I prefer the company of a man
who bears the white man's burden
and is sanctified by purity.
Luciana is the Treasury Minister's wife, right?
Yes.
A joke has been making the rounds.
They say Luciana has the most beautiful body
that Zama has ever imagined.
Who said that?
Over there.
The bald man.
Maybe I should leave.
I don't have the strength.
Doctor Palos?
Doctor Palos?
- It's the dead boy.
The little saint is there.
Palos?
Who are you?
I wish to speak with the Minister of the Treasury,
Señor Honorio Piñares de Luenga.
My business can be postponed.
I need to see a doctor who honors that title.
May I speak with someone in the house?
And Señora Piñares de Luenga, is she in?
Distilled in a double alambic.
So it's distilled many times before it's ready.
You'll appreciate it.
These recipes are jealously guarded.
Have you been to Buenos Aires?
- Yes.
I read that many comedy troupes
put on plays with their orchestras.
We have almost no occasion for elegance here.
That's not something you lack.
My wife wanted to go.
My wife wanted to go.
Me, I'm always on the river...
that comes and goes...
Always far away,
for one reason or another.
It's aged in casks.
Such nobility!
See those?
Bring me the little glasses.
No, the smaller ones.
How beautiful.
There were twelve of them. Only eight arrived.
They came in a box, well protected,
but not all of them wrapped.
Such laziness, this packaging.
They were wrapped in newspapers from Buenos Aires.
And curiously enough, sent with that flotilla,
were newspapers dated back further
than the newspapers wrapped around my glasses.
My glasses carried more recent news
than the papers distributed here.
Isn't that charming?
And sad?
It doesn't weigh on you, don Diego,
because you'll be transferred any day now, I hear.
It doesn't weigh on you, don Diego,
because you'll be transferred any day now, I hear.
Where are you hoping to be sent?
To the city of Lerma.
But not just yet.
We have almost no occasion for elegance here.
The newspapers spoke of the uproar caused by...
I forget the play.
The applause...
How rare, the occasions for applause.
To the actors who dare to disguise themselves!
Our friend is not well.
Should I send for Doctor Palos?
- No, I'm already aware.
Diego...
How timely it is for me to intercede
in favor of your friend's affairs.
Luciana.
Come in!
Has he left?
He felt indisposed.
His poor manners are forgiven.
You should send for Doctor Palos.
- Of course.
As soon as your friend recovers,
come see me again, Diego.
I'll do everything in my powers.
I'll send a letter to my husband,
informing him of our affairs.
When he's away,
he torments me with tender missives.
This servant here, this black,
comes and goes with messages.
With this heat...
Señora,
it grieves me to learn this.
Many women despise my independence.
And too many men misunderstand my conduct.
Small-minded people.
Yet abundant.
People are less alone
in the big cities,
while knowing each other less, don't you think?
Is this summer worse, or am I just more impatient?
Houses suffocate me.
I prefer the river.
If only we had some cold months.
Yes, time doesn't pass when there's no winter.
The snow...
So elegant.
The Russian princesses wrapped in furs.
The perfumes.
The heated houses, with rugs.
Europe is best remembered
by those who were never there.
I recall nothing about it.
Marriage forces you to forget.
Or so I've been told.
Diego, let's not be reckless.
The Governor has sent me to assist you.
- What's this circus?
These people have friends in high places.
The Governor wants to hold onto his position.
- My position?
Yes. Yours, too.
The Administration's Magistrate,
Diego de Zama.
Ventura Prieto, Assistant Magistrate.
We are old settlers of Concepción.
Descendants of the first-comers.
Our father is a direct, blood descendant
of don Domingo Martínez de Irala.
We chased the Indians from these lands.
But they came back with claims.
We chased them out again,
and so on.
They fled into the jungle.
We went looking for them,
and showed no mercy.
None were spared.
And now there's no one left to work.
I only have my granddaughter.
She has mixed blood.
She was held captive.
We managed to get her back.
It's our right to claim an encomienda.
Forty tame Indians.
A concession of Indians?
You shall have enough Indians.
You may return in peace.
You have the Governor's word:
His Majesty will receive your request.
They don't have title deeds or documents.
We have nothing.
Find a way to retrieve them.
This noble family has suffered enough.
The name of Irala isn't enough to enslave natives.
What did you say, Ventura?
Taking away freedom requires more
than a paper with Irala's name on it.
You disapprove of my benevolence?
What title do you deem valid
to obtain an encomienda of Indians?
None.
Am I talking to a functionary of the Crown?
You're talking to a man
astonished by the number of Americans
who want to pass for Spaniards
instead of being what they are.
"A man, astonished by..."
Such bravura!
They say you almost captured Vicuña Porto!
Diego,
what have they done to you?
When will you return?
Your children are growing.
They're growing tired.
And so am I.
I'll be there soon, Marta.
A ship is coming.
With Royal Mail.
For overdue payments.
We must be patient, Marta.
Are you hurt?
He humiliated me.
He bit me.
So many times.
Have you avenged me, Diego?
He forced me to submit to his desires.
He mocked me.
You avenged me.
Who did this, Rita?
Officer Bermúdez.
The bald one?
He thought no one would come to my defense.
You, Zama, who have nothing.
I won't let my father fight a duel.
You have nothing to lose.
You avenged me.
And now...
that scoundrel is dead.
No.
I didn't kill him.
Who said that?
Then you must avenge me.
You're capable of killing,
you have nothing to lose.
Yes, I do.
A wife.
I have children, Rita.
I'm the Crown's magistrate. A functionary.
A monk has come.
He said you should pay for the funeral expenses.
Who died, Rita?
A part of the payment must be advanced.
The rest can be paid
when the mourning period allows, of course.
I was told the cargo of the deceased
is being held up at customs.
Have they seized it?
They released two casks to cover burial expenses.
Brandy that we sell at a very reasonable price.
People grow tired of schnapps...
The other casks were taken into custody.
The customs officer informed me.
Death imposes conditions on all of us.
I'll offend his stature
if I conduct a ceremony for the poor.
Where?
Next to his father.
The preparation of the bodies must be paid for
before their transfer to Montevideo.
Until then, we'll have to keep them in our crypt.
It's cooler here.
We could also burn them.
They died of the plague.
Don't incur further expenses, Excellency.
That needs to be discussed
with the Father Accountant in charge of accounts.
I would like to shave.
I didn't want you to hear
about the unfortunate event from anyone else.
Our friend, the Oriental, is dead.
I don't need air.
Your friend wasn't well.
A dead boy?
The plague in the ships is relentless.
How unfortunate.
Malemba wants to get married.
Who is Malemba?
The funeral will keep us very busy these days.
We must prepare for the mourning.
Let's drink in his honor.
There won't be a wake.
The Oriental was an austere man.
The Bishop believes we should adhere to his ways.
Such austerity.
What a pity.
There will be no wake.
Only something modest and boring.
How sad. What a shame.
Who wants to get married?
Malemba.
She bought her freedom
and already wants to lose it.
I told my husband: she can't give her consent.
Can a mute give her consent?
No!
The black came today with letters.
All men covet my body.
Honorio, my own husband, is fascinated by flesh.
I despise him.
And all men for their desire to possess.
I'm grateful
for having met a woman of your character.
Malemba has suffered enough.
She swam across the river,
fleeing an abusive tobacco farmer.
She swam not only for hours. How long was it?
How long?
Days in the water, holding on to her life.
She was captured again in Chaco.
They skinned her feet,
and rubbed that horrible plant on her.
On the soles of her feet.
I thought her muteness and limping
were linked.
She's not mute.
She has her tongue.
I want to settle this marriage affair.
Malemba's.
Nothing prevents it.
Valid consent is given in written form.
Your husband's signature will validate the union.
Your mute can get married.
You deserve a kiss.
Not now.
A message for Diego de Zama.
It's me. Speak.
The Governor says you must go.
I must go?
To his office.
Mail has arrived.
It's over!
Governor?
"Having requested observance
of this sovereign provision
and given a hearing
to the Royal Accord on this case,
I have resolved by this decree
of last November 27th,
declaring as I declare, that blah, blah, blah..."
I'm being transferred to Spain.
Royal Mail?
When did it arrive? Any news for me?
No, not yet.
I've been forced, due to your superior rank,
to deport Ventura Prieto.
Deported for a brawl?
It was just a brawl.
A street brawl doesn't look good
for a functionary of your status.
I didn't want to be excessively severe.
I've written a recommendation letter
for Ventura Prieto.
What's important is that
his reputation not be tainted.
Ventura is a Spanish functionary.
You can't afford such risks, Diego.
You've chosen the city of Lerma.
Yes.
I've requested a transfer to the city of Lerma.
Ventura Prieto has chosen the city of Lerma.
The deported...
gets to choose his destination
and gets a recommendation?
Make a copy of the Crown's resolution.
And announce my departure at once.
Malemba,
tell your Señora I need to see her.
Malemba, is someone at the door?
Will you not announce me?
Honorio had been asleep for a while
when suddenly I woke up startled and saw it,
crawling up Honorio's neck.
I couldn't move, cry or shout.
What's here?
It itches.
At dawn, I saw it on the ground.
It was still moving, with grubs on its back.
It was the spider wasp.
It lays eggs inside living spiders.
Help me with this.
Malemba, is someone at the door?
Curtains from Damascus.
Missing.
A table with ebony nailing.
There was a painting on that wall.
A portrait of Our Majesty, the King.
The Governor was very fond
of that painting, too.
The chairs with velvet upholstery?
They were to his liking, too.
He took the harnesses and 14 saddles.
Should I record this?
That's not him.
It's that one.
Can't he walk?
Does he talk?
A few words.
"The sailor's wife gets rich,
when plenty are the fish!"
Come, Zama. Pull up a chair.
Today is a lucky day.
Show him the ears.
Tell him the story.
The ears of Vicuña Porto,
cut off before his execution.
The cruelty of men...
This is what's at stake.
Slowly.
Governor, I've brought you a scribe.
If this game will last for long, I can excuse him.
A scribe?
For the letter you offered to write.
What letter?
My request to the King
on the occasion of my becoming a father.
You're a father?
Bring the child, they bring luck.
The ears change hands!
What's in the bag?
Allow me.
Well, well!
Magistrate.
This... is worthless.
Coconuts are worthless, right?
Doesn't matter.
I'll keep it anyway.
Officer,
see our friend to the city gates.
Vicuña Porto is dead.
One shouldn't touch them.
Don't touch.
No.
The ears of Vicuña Porto.
Vicuña...
...is dead.
The ears of Vicuña Porto.
Governor,
could you attend to the letter?
Of course.
A letter to the King requesting your transfer.
We'll plead to His Majesty for my good friend.
What are you writing?
A book, Governor.
We need to draft a letter
to be sealed and...
A book?
A book?
Make children,
not books.
Learn a lesson from our Magistrate, Manuel.
I can't know how my children will be.
But I do know how this book will be.
Your Eminence,
I believe there's nothing to worry about.
Let's go.
Should I look for another scribe?
- Let's go!
Should I look for another scribe?
Why write a book
inside the house of Government,
while others work for the glory of His Majesty?
I only wish...
Were you aware of this book?
Your Eminence,
I believe there's nothing to worry about.
You didn't know about this book?
I never knew about the book.
How long have you been here, Zama?
You knew nothing about it?
The oldest functionary in the Administration
knows nothing about this book?
I want to grill those fish with their heads.
Get the horses out of here.
This isn't a stable.
What is it?
- A message for Diego de Zama.
That's me. What is it?
- Inventory.
What inventory?
They're taking everything to the patio.
The Governor
commands everyone to clean and tidy up.
Take this.
I know the Governor has requested
you report on my book.
Here it is.
For your consideration.
Fernández,
I haven't yet decided
on my new residence.
I need to keep my furniture
in the chapel a bit longer.
Let me help you.
You're my first reader.
Which are your things?
The bed.
These three chairs.
Two small chests with my name on them.
They're making an inventory
of the Government's property.
Your furniture has been listed.
I could remove some things.
But it has a cost.
How inadequate!
When I've settled in a new residence,
I'll send for my belongings.
We must do it now,
and with the utmost discretion.
I was told of an inn on the outskirts.
Let me help you.
You're my first reader.
Take care of the move.
That boy she's holding is my son.
Is that the mother?
- Yes.
That one.
Emilia.
Fernández,
take that bed to Señora Emilia.
What is this dump?
The porters,
they're afraid of this house.
Leave it there.
I'll only stay a few days.
Until I find a proper residence.
Keep the book until you finish it.
I haven't made a copy.
I know nothing about your book.
I never knew it existed.
And no one has requested a report.
The Governor feels that working hours
at the Government House are to serve the King.
Your Grace,
with all due respect,
I have no master, when I write my book.
I wish it were the inexplicable.
But a boy is in there.
Bury this book,
until all of this blows over, Fernández.
Go away!
Who are you?
Zumala.
Bring me a chain and a lock.
No one enters this house.
Tell the innkeeper
to bring me a chain and a lock.
He's sick.
The innkeeper is sick.
I need a shirt.
Am I your wife?
You're the mother of my son.
Governor, should I fetch another scribe
for the letter to the King that you suggested?
No letter without a report.
What report?
Do I need to ask for it?
A book is being written behind the Crown's back,
which is your back as well.
Your Eminence, I don't think you should worry.
You should worry.
I expect a damning report, ruthless,
that puts an end to this chicanery.
Only then will I be willing to
make your request to the King.
Leaving out, of course,
that your son is a bastard.
The Magistrate knows well
that this benefit is only reserved
for a functionary's legitimate son.
Governor,
my transfer has suffered more delays
than those tolerable.
Here's what I think:
You want to leave?
Write the report.
He has his ways.
They say he executed Vicuña without mercy.
Zumala!
Zumala...
I rang the bell and nobody answered.
I'd like to eat.
We were sad.
She died.
Who died?
Zumala is dead.
Then who are you?
Tora.
Tora,
you should introduce me to the other guests...
the ladies with the hair...
- You are our only guest, Zama.
Magistrate...
The Governor ordered this rearrangement.
At your service.
These are days of scarce work
for my Ministry.
I've been informed of that.
Did the Governor mention the report?
What report?
You were told about it.
No.
The Governor only told me to relocate here.
Here!
That's for me.
These are doña Emilia's fish.
Gifts from doña Emilia?
They were bought.
Not gifts.
Overdue payments.
29 times 1,000 makes 29,000.
Minus 3,500 already received, makes...
25,500.
This house is rotten.
Rest, don Diego.
The sealed letter is the one that counts,
Fernández.
Crossing the ocean to make a plea...
Take it easy.
It's hot.
At night,
we could hear a great noise.
Then they appeared.
They're...
round rocks,
like coconuts,
but made of stone.
And their insides are filled with precious stones.
So pretty...
What marvels!
I wouldn't want to tarnish Fernández's honor.
Maybe send him to the city of Lerma,
with a recommendation.
He's very young.
A minor sentence should be enough warning.
Excellent.
Ruthless.
Such a...
sharp pen.
Could Your Excellency write
that letter you offered me?
What letter?
The letter to the King,
requesting my transfer.
Of course. You're a father now.
The first letter is very important.
What do you mean, the first letter?
In a year or two, we'll send the second one.
His Majesty doesn't consider these matters
until the second time.
I'll immediately send the first letter.
I'll send the first letter, immediately.
Don Diego de Zama.
Thank you for coming.
The list of your titles is impressive.
You were a corregidor.
It's surprising to find a volunteer
for a mission like this.
Captain Parrilla
is commanding the troops.
Are you aware of the mission?
We must get rid of Vicuña Porto.
They won't beat us, Captain.
What we seek is to reactivate commerce.
We must put an end to theft,
to arson,
to gambling houses.
We must clean up the trade routes.
That is what my Administration
sets out to achieve.
How long have you been here?
A long time now.
Excellent.
We have your transfer request here.
His Majesty will celebrate
this return to arms and especially to victory.
We must bring back the head of Vicuña Porto.
You'll be received as heroes.
With great pomp.
I woke up last night
and felt something crawling on my neck.
I went like this,
and felt something strange.
It's swollen.
Must be a spider wasp.
No. A spider.
Is it an Indian?
If so, there'll be pieces of silver.
It's a dead man.
The Indians, the canoeist
and the other two deserted.
No silver?
Nothing, only a dead man.
Take some men and capture the deserters!
Don't move. Be still.
500 or more of them.
They're the blind.
Stay calm and you'll live.
They were punished.
And the children were born after the punishment.
Punished by Vicuña Porto?
Maybe by you people.
They took the horses.
They walk fast for blind people.
They walk fast
so as not to disappoint their children.
Nighttime is safer for the blind.
I rather hide during the day.
That's my sword.
I should introduce myself.
My name is Vicuña Porto.
And you?
What's the corregidor's name?
Mercy.
What did you say, corregidor?
Who's there?
- Diego de Zama.
We're coming.
They took the horses.
There's nothing left.
Don't say my name and you'll live.
Halt!
Two Guanáes are coming, don't turn around!
Don't turn around.
They're fantasized.
"Fantasized?"
Disguised.
Friends.
Stay still.
They invited us to a celebration.
A celebration?
Tell them that the King of Spain,
Lord of these vast lands,
sends his regards and offers His friendship.
They want the animal.
They want the animal.
Does the corregidor have any suggestions?
Let's go.
Diego de Zama.
Soldier Gaspar Toledo.
Soldier Giusepe Nascimento.
Soldier Umbilino Maria.
We can't return without Vicuña Porto.
See that man with the knife?
That's Vicuña Porto.
Traitor.
Careful!
Right in the middle.
Food!
We have food, Captain!
Fish today!
- The famine is over!
Food!
Vicuña Porto!
Tell your men to line up and lay down their arms.
It's over.
Traitor!
That smell.
The tigers will smell that arm.
Dead meat makes them curious.
But they won't eat it.
Instead, they'll pounce us.
Don't tell them I'm sick.
Traitor.
Who's singing?
Who sings?
I've committed sins.
But not all those...
they blame on Vicuña Porto.
Understand?
That's right.
The Vicuña Porto they talk about doesn't exist.
It's not me.
It's no one.
It's a name.
A name.
Understand?
My name is Gaspar Toledo.
What is it?
What's my name, corregidor?
I'm not a corregidor.
That's right.
You're not the corregidor,
and I'm not Vicuña Porto.
But...
my men want to get rich.
My men
want to be rich.
I promised them it would be so.
I need the corregidor
to find the coconuts.
What coconuts?
You are the corregidor, right?
A little water!
The captain wants water?
- Water!
Don't look at me, traitor. Not even a glance.
Water.
I have a plan. His Majesty will reward you.
We'll return with honors...
They want to get rich.
Name the place.
Anywhere North, any place will do.
What place?
Where the coconuts are!
What coconuts?
You're the corregidor.
Corregidor,
the place with the stones, the round stones.
The guide doesn't know the place?
I'm not a guide.
The corregidor knows the place.
The coconuts, full of precious stones.
The corregidor knows...
Those stones are worthless.
He's lying!
They're worthless.
Traitor.
They're worthless.
He's lying!
Where are the coconuts?
Those stones are worthless.
The stones!
You're lying!
You'll die!
Death to Zama!
Death!
Leave!
Leave!
I do for you what no one did for me.
He's lying.
Leave!
I say no to your hopes.
Death to Zama!
Hold him.
Shove your stumps in the sand.
If you don't bleed out, you'll survive.
Do you want to live?
Do you want to live?
