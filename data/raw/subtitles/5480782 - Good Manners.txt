- Hello?
- Dona Ana, 15th floor.
Your name?
Clara Macedo.
She said she'd put me on the list.
You can come in.
The service elevator is on the left.
Hi, I'm so sorry,
I completely forgot our appointment.
- I thought nobody else was coming.
- Was I supposed to call?
No, I'm actually interviewing
another nanny now.
I see.
Could you wait a while?
Please, come in.
Wait here, I'll be calling you soon.
Sorry, Cida.
You were talking about your method.
Yes, I only care for children
until the age of three.
Early childhood is very important,
it's the rooting phase.
- Then I move on.
- I see.
But don't worry.
First-pregnancy moms
usually feel insecure.
I know all the phases,
what is normal and what is not.
Are you OK, ma'am?
Shall I call your husband?
No, it was just a pang.
It's gone.
So Cida,
I have your contact details.
I'll think about your counterproposal
and I'll get back to you.
Think about it carefully.
That's the current market rate.
Good afternoon and good luck to you.
Thanks.
It says here
you trained as a nurse, right?
That's right, at Santa Luzia.
Did you complete your degree?
No, I wasn't able to.
Things got difficult.
I had to stop.
But I want to finish it later.
You also looked after children
at a school.
- Do you like children?
- I do. Who doesn't?
- Do you have any?
- No, I live alone.
Right.
You don't really have any experience
as a nanny, do you?
I don't, but I took care
of my grandmother
for seven years, until she died.
OK.
Listen, Clara,
I need someone who can sleep here,
to help me with the housework,
the meals...
Aren't you looking for a nanny?
I am, but...
At least until the baby is born,
I'll need help with the housework.
I can't take care
of a place like this alone.
Yeah... it is huge.
But when you start
taking care of the baby
I'll hire someone
to share the work with you.
OK then. Here...
you don't mention the phone numbers
of your references.
Can you give them to me?
I don't have them on me.
Can I do that later?
- None at all?
- No.
No... In fact...
I have Dona Amélia's.
A lady I took care of.
That will do.
Dona Amélia.
Go ahead.
Two, five...
seven, eight...
seven, nine...
two, four.
She's usually not home
at this time of day.
Hello. Dona Amélia?
Hello, ma'am.
My name's Ana, I'm here with Clara...
Clara Macedo.
I'm interviewing her for a job
so I'm checking her references.
Did she take care of you?
She's asking
where her remote control is.
It must be under the couch.
She always drops it there.
She says it is...
OK. I'll give her your message.
Thank you for this information.
Goodbye.
She wants you to go there
to pay the rent.
I'm sorry. She's my landlady.
But I have other references.
I can give them to you later,
if you want.
Clara...
I'm really sorry, but...
The thing is, you're not coming
through an agency so...
Take a deep breath.
Breathe out very slowly.
That's right.
That's it.
Breathe out very slowly.
That's good.
Feeling better?
I am.
Thanks.
I'm going now.
Clara...
Can you cook?
The TV room is here.
My bedroom's at the end of the hall.
There's a bathroom.
This is the baby's bedroom.
It's still not ready.
It needs to be tidied up.
The crib hasn't been put together.
It's a mess.
There's stuff all over the place.
I don't know this tune.
It's old.
It's beautiful.
It is.
It was my grandfather's,
then my father's, now it's mine.
I'm amazed this thing still works.
Listen, I need someone
who can help me all day,
someone who's discreet,
I hate being gossiped about.
Shall we go to the kitchen
and discuss money?
GOOD MANNERS
Stormy night
The raindrops outside
Are for me a lullaby
But affliction for the poor
Freezing rain
That falls so heavily
And invades his shanty
Making mud on the floor
Shut up, Teobalda!
If during the day gone by
I denied my brother help
How can I be happy now?
Good evening.
Dona Amélia,
I need my clothes back.
You can take them.
If you pay me
and give me back my remote control.
I got a job.
Not around here.
Towards the city center.
I'll pay part of the rent tomorrow,
and the rest by the 15th.
My boss needs me
to start at once,
so she hired me straightaway.
Right... Let's see
if you manage to keep this job.
You never stay put anywhere.
OK, Clara.
You can take your clothes.
But the microwave stays
until you pay what you owe me.
Deal.
Oh Teobalda...
I can find no peace of mind
Dona Ana?
I'd have cooked something better,
but you only bought meat.
I'll give you my credit card and PIN.
It's better if you do the shopping.
What?
All right.
I'll do the shopping.
Big spoon...
It's a soup spoon.
Would you like a teaspoon?
Do you know about etiquette?
What do you mean?
Because of the spoon?
My mother forced me
to do a course on etiquette.
A finishing course for girls.
One of the exercises was
about having soup without slurping.
There was another one
about correcting your posture.
The teacher made us
put a book on our heads...
to see if...
We had to put a book on our heads
and walk.
See, it didn't really work.
Turn the fireplace on, will you?
Just hit the green button.
Good night.
Those are its kidneys.
And this is its little spine.
Eye.
Nose.
Little mouth.
It was just a little kick.
Do you want to know its sex?
I don't know.
OK, go on then.
You see that?
It's a boy.
His weight is around 15 ounces
and his heart rate is 150.
- Is he normal?
- Yes.
For 20 weeks,
he's even above the weight chart.
And the pangs you've been having
are normal.
It's your body getting ready.
Crystal Woods Mall,
special like you.
- Can I exchange it?
- Yes, within 30 days.
I saw it when you tried it on.
It suits you.
When will you have it in black?
Tarsi?
Tarsila!
I didn't know you were in São Paulo!
Hi, Ana.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. See you soon.
- I'll take them.
- Good.
Put my old shoes in the box.
I'll keep the new ones on.
- Did they fit you?
- Yeah.
Credit or debit?
Credit.
It says "payment declined".
Shall I try again?
Use this one.
They're nice shoes.
Eighth floor. Going down.
Hey Clara!
You were there?
Beer, Dona Ana?
It's good for my milk.
Not that one.
Hey, chillax!
Come here.
Have a drink with me.
The condo manager called.
You haven't paid the fee.
Is that a new T-shirt?
Yes, I bought it at the mall.
It's cute.
Someone called on the intercom.
To say there's going
to be an owners' meeting.
Have a drink with me, Clara.
Come on!
It's my birthday!
Today?
Twenty-nine.
My Saturn return is over!
Hooray!
Go on, have this.
Only one.
A toast to your birthday, Dona Ana.
Thank you, Dona Clara.
Is that at your farm?
This? Yeah.
That's Pagode.
My little Pagode.
Animal eyes are so beautiful.
It looks like they're thinking.
Has it been long
since you were last there?
I moved here in January.
Do you miss it?
What's wrong?
We don't speak anymore.
Actually, my father cut ties with me.
Nobody sent me a message today
or called.
I texted my brothers, nobody replied.
Why?
Something stupid.
I was going to get married this year.
In September.
Then...
this happened,
my father went mad
and he brought me here
so I'd get rid of it.
But I didn't.
I don't know, I couldn't do it.
I just couldn't.
I don't get it.
The guy didn't want it?
No, the father isn't Aécio, my fiancé.
Ex-fiancé.
When I told him I couldn't do it,
he wrote a statement,
put it on the Internet.
Moron!
"Cynical" is spelled with a "C"!
Then I had no reason
to go back there.
So I decided to stay here.
At least
this apartment is in my name.
But you don't have to...
mind what people think or say.
Fuck them.
But my father doesn't want
to see me anymore.
You understand?
This will pass.
No, it won't. You don't know them.
Yes, it will.
All you have to do is wait.
Mind your own life.
I'm sorry, Clara.
Pregnancy makes you more sensitive.
They say it's normal.
Plus, there's nothing to do here.
I don't know...
Maybe I'm just missing Pagode really.
He must be missing me too.
It's so good
to be near someone who likes you.
Let's take a picture.
Here.
That's it.
Hang on.
28 weeks.
Everything is fine.
Your blood pressure is a bit high,
though.
Clara,
I want you to measure it every day
and to note it all down.
I'll prescribe a new diet for you, Ana.
It'll be difficult at first,
but you'll feel better after a while.
CUT OUT MEAT
Here...
I think he's here.
I brought this for you.
"Baby Name Guide"?
To help you think about it.
Do you need anything else?
I'm going out.
No, I'll stay here listening to him.
OK. Good night.
- Where are you going?
- To a bar.
Right.
Take your cellphone.
How can anyone carry such a big bag
and not a lighter in it?
Do you have one?
No bag or lighter.
A woman who goes out without a bag?
Can I sit down, to try and understand
what planet you're from?
João, can you get us two beers?
Where are you from?
From far away...
Gilda.
Do we know each other?
You're a manager
at Crystal Woods Mall.
Stop it!
You're a psychic.
I'm stunned!
You forgot to take your badge off.
What an idiot!
I'm so stupid.
I hate it when I do this!
I always keep this badge on.
Done.
How about you?
Running away from your boss?
I don't need to run away from anyone.
You're so beautiful.
Come, Gilda!
We're about to sing "Happy Birthday".
I'm here for the party of an employee.
I have to go there.
But I want to take you along.
I can't. I must go home.
At least tell me your name.
Clara.
Ana?
You should go to bed.
Come to bed.
Did you sleep well?
I had a weird dream.
But I'm fine.
I didn't see what time you got back.
Was it late?
No.
I got back early.
Was it fun?
At the bar. Was it nice?
A bit expensive, I thought.
But it's a beautiful place.
Joel.
What?
The baby's name.
Biblical, isn't it?
I don't know. Is it?
It is.
I chose it because of how it sounds.
I like it.
Joel.
Joel.
I like it too.
PREGNANCY NOTES
SLEEPWALKING
SLEEP DISORDER
Ana.
Calm down.
- You were having a dream.
- Goodness me!
It was horrible.
- I'll get you some water.
- No, stay here a while.
Please.
Easy now.
I dreamed that...
all my teeth were falling off.
Then suddenly,
I found myself in the woods and...
I started to dig a hole
to bury my teeth in.
It just never ended.
I kept digging and digging...
Jesus!
Don't ask me
What's the best way out of this
I've suffered too much for love
Now I'm going to enjoy my life
Cry, call me
Beg for my kisses again
Ask me for help
Maybe I'll come to your rescue
Cry, call me
Beg me for my love
Say "please"
Maybe one day I'll look for you again
Ana,
lunch is almost ready.
You weren't supposed to fall in love
We were only having fun
I warned you
Honey, I warned you
You knew what I wanted
One-night love not meant to last
I told you so
Honey, I told you so
It won't be easy
For you to have me in your hands
Wow! It's delicious!
This is grade A!
- What happened to your hand?
- Nothing.
I cut myself while cooking.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
You're strange.
Ana, I need to tell you something.
You're suffering from some kind
of sleepwalking disorder.
You walk around the apartment
at night.
Not every night.
I first noticed it last month
and now it's happening again.
And this wound...
you did it.
I hurt you?
Yesterday,
you went out again at night.
You walked along the streets.
- I'm going crazy.
- No.
- It's this pregnancy...
- No!
This pregnancy,
these nightmares...
I was told they're normal,
but I have them every month.
- Four nights in a row!
- Calm down.
Dr. Ciro said it was good
to have someone near me.
You mustn't upset yourself.
It's not good for you.
Or for the baby.
When I was looking after my grandmother,
she taught me many things.
She wasn't a doctor,
but she knew how to take care of people.
She used to say
that on full moon nights,
the baby always gets restless.
And that the water
in the mother's belly
is like the water in the sea.
There's no full moon tonight.
We'll do a test.
The flour will tell us
if you get up in the night.
Good night.
Is everything OK?
It's over.
Good morning.
Sleep on the ground
Sleep on the hay
Sleep, my little horse
You've been alive for just a day
Run in the meadow
Run on the...
Run, my little horse
For this world is so vast
Night has fallen
The world is pitch-dark
Baby better go to bed
Sleep in the hammock
Sleep...
In the cradle
Sleep, my little child
So that you won't feel thirsty
If you're afraid
Call out my name
Sleep, my little child
So that you won't feel
Hungry
I can't remember it well.
You can keep the money left
after the bills to yourself.
Maybe pay Dona Amélia.
Are you kidding?
There'll be enough even for the baby.
No, don't exaggerate.
You don't know how to be thrifty.
Ana...
why do you have a gun?
I know you keep one in the drawer.
You need one at the farm,
too many animals.
But we're not in the forest.
I got used to having one around.
Have you ever killed an animal?
Of course I have.
When did you last kill?
I'll tell you when I last used my gun.
Will that do?
Yes.
It was during a holiday
in Goiás Velho.
My girlfriends had stood me up
and I decided to go out on my own.
I ended the night
at the top of a hill.
In a cowboy dive bar.
That's where I met him.
Jorge Mário.
We got in the car
and drove to Macaco Hill.
Then...
we did it right there.
Then I passed out.
I was woken up by a growl.
Jorge had gone away.
The beast stared at me
before running off into the woods.
It had...
shiny eyes.
A look of anger.
How about the guy?
I didn't see him again.
Ever again.
I looked for him
when I found out I was pregnant.
But no one...
No one knew him in town.
He's huge.
Big eyes.
Big mouth.
Big hands.
He's robust, Ana.
Your weight is perfect as well.
You can gorge yourself
on the corn cakes
of Saint John's festival.
No mulled wine, though.
I'll prescribe a tranquilizer
for her insomnia.
Give her half a pill.
What she's feeling now is normal.
We're on the home straight.
Can I give her meat again?
No.
You know what I'd like?
- A food craving?
- Yeah.
Big time.
Pine nuts.
I'm so sorry.
He'll have a pine-nut birthmark.
I won't be able to sleep
if I don't eat some.
- They take too long to cook.
- You can buy them ready.
But you shouldn't stay here alone.
It's not far.
OK.
I'll rush there and back.
Thank you.
It's my job.
Breathe, Ana.
Breathe out.
Calm down.
I'll call Dr. Ciro.
You've reached Dr. Ciro.
Please, leave a message.
Lady, beware
Quicken your pace
The street is dark
Beyond that square
All kinds of creatures
Hide in the night
Lady who runs
Out of my sight
That child had better
Not cry
Hold it tight against you
As you cross to the other side
Walk steadily
And fear won't be there
Don't ever look back
That's the advice we share
Don't ever look back
That's the advice we share
On my body I carry
Your blood, your clothes
What life holds in store
I still have no clue
But tonight
Under the rain
There's only the two of us left
I will protect you
There's only the two of us left
I will protect you
Mom, you must do it like the man!
- Good morning, Clara.
- Morning, Dona Glória.
Hi, Joel. How are you?
Hello!
I thought you weren't going to come.
I'm sorry, Dona Norma.
Joel's been sick this week.
We haven't been sleeping well.
It must be great to be a nurse's son.
Right, Joel?
You're always very well cared for.
Amanda, sweetheart!
A friend of yours is waiting here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
She wants to ask him
to be her partner
at the school's
Saint-John square dance.
He's a bit weak.
I don't think he should go.
It'd be a pity.
You should let up on your son, Clara.
He never steps outside.
Aren't you gonna have
at least a cake today?
No.
I don't think so.
Mom said
she and I would celebrate alone.
So I'll give this to you now.
I made it myself.
Luíza.
Marco.
Maurício.
Maurício excelled himself.
Very good, Maurício.
Natália.
Where's Natália?
It's OK, it was really hard.
Don't feel bad.
Yesterday, I went with my father
to the city center,
on the other side of the river.
He told me when I turn 10,
he'll teach me to drive.
Cool!
Cool.
What's that?
Mortadella. You never eaten it?
No, thanks.
I don't know
how you can eat that stuff.
It's healthy.
Eat it then.
- Want some?
- No way!
The Saint-John party
is gonna be awesome.
- 120.
- That's it.
So my blood pressure is 120 over 80.
You got it?
Roughly, yes.
- I'll write it all down for you.
- Thanks.
How about a drink tonight
with the girls from the butcher's?
No.
I have some things to do at home.
You're not into going out, are you?
It's hard with a child.
Look, I have a spaghetti arm!
Maurício, let's go.
Come on, get in.
I'm in a hurry.
I still have a client to pick up.
Let's go.
Dad.
It's Joel's birthday.
Happy birthday, kid.
- Thanks.
- A little gift.
- See you tomorrow, dude.
- See ya.
Joel! Clara!
I need a hand with something!
What do you think she wants?
Happy birthday to you
From old friends and new
May good luck be with you
And happiness too
Go on, Joel, make a wish.
But you mustn't tell anyone about it.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday, my darling.
- You remembered.
- Of course I did!
I made a beef stew as well.
No!
You're allergic to that.
This kid needs proteins, Clara.
Eat slowly.
- Because of your tooth.
- OK.
Son,
it's time for the little bedroom.
Come, Joel.
- How tall?
- Wait.
There.
Look how much you've grown!
I'll soon be taller than Maurício.
Who gave you that?
Amanda did, for my birthday.
- I'll give it back to you later, OK?
- OK.
Is it too tight?
- You see this?
- Yeah.
You've been biting it.
That's why your tooth is aching.
If you remember,
try not to bite it, right?
OK.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Wait.
Mom...
You know what would be cool?
If I could go to the school party
with Amanda.
Will you let me?
Joel...
- When's the party?
- On Friday.
The thing is...
Friday is still the full moon.
Little-bedroom night.
I can never do anything.
Just a little longer.
It'll soon be over.
Good night.
You weren't supposed to fall in love
We were only having fun
I warned you
Honey, I warned you
You knew what I wanted
One-night love...
Are you having lunch right now?
Good morning.
Good morning.
How's your tooth?
What tooth?
The one that was aching.
Which one?
Can't you remember?
This one at the back.
The ache's gone.
Do you remember biting the chain?
I think...
I don't remember.
Would you tell me
the story of the river?
Once again?
Yes.
Once upon a time
there was a river
that flowed under a very big bridge.
One day,
a beautiful boy called Joel appeared
on the riverbank.
It was a beautiful night.
The full moon was shining bright,
its light reflected on the water.
I was going home,
and I started to hear
some very low crying.
I went down to the riverbank
and found the boy,
swaddled in a blue blanket.
He was crying hard.
Hungry.
As if he wanted to hold on to life.
Wasn't there a letter as well?
No. Only the boy.
Who left me there?
I don't know.
It could have been the stork.
Or the Bogeyman.
All I know is you were left there
as a gift to me.
You got up weak this morning.
I'll ask Dona Amélia to look after you
while I'm at the pharmacy.
You mustn't go out, OK?
I left your lunch in the fridge.
Good.
That's it.
Right.
Very good.
That's it. Very good.
Well done, it's great.
You've learned it.
What's the matter?
I'm tired.
Did you have breakfast today?
I ate some bread.
Only bread, Joel?
That's no food for a child.
I can't eat that.
Yes, you can.
It'll do you good.
It's delicious and good for your health.
Only, you mustn't tell your mother.
It'll be our secret, OK?
- It smells good.
- It's delicious, you'll love it.
Go eat it.
Chew it well!
Joel?
Are you feeling better?
Where's Dona Amélia?
Who's she?
You went through my things.
I told you not to do that!
I saw you hide that photo.
I look like her,
just like Maurício looks like his father!
You liar!
You know who she is!
Son, I was going to tell you
when you were older.
Liar!
Tell me!
What else
have you been hiding from me?
She died, Joel.
When you were born.
You're trying to fool me!
Calm down, I've never seen you like this.
I'm telling the truth.
I can never do anything!
I have to sleep and eat
when you tell me to!
- I've had enough of the little bedroom.
- Calm down, Joel!
- And I won't eat your filthy food again!
- Be quiet!
Into the little bedroom right now!
I won't go!
Yes, you will. I am your mother!
You're not my mother!
I won't go!
Yes, you will, right now!
I tell you what to do.
You must obey me!
CRYSTAL WOODS MALL
What happened today?
What did you tell Joel?
Me, Clara?
Nothing.
You left him alone.
He was ill!
But he got better.
He soon felt stronger
and looked healthier.
He even studied for his English test.
I had a choir rehearsal,
so I came down.
He wasn't this way when I went out.
Something happened.
He's very different.
What did you do, Dona Amélia?
I cooked him something.
- What?
- A steak.
One of mine.
I thought it'd do him good
and it did.
He didn't look weak at all.
Clara.
That kid feels poorly every month.
He gets sick every month.
If he doesn't get better,
he'll need a healer.
Joel!
What do you want?
We're here to see Joel,
to know if he's better.
He's fine. He's gone to bed.
We'd like to give him something.
For our school presentation tomorrow.
I don't know if he'll go tomorrow.
It'll depend on how he feels.
Can you still give this to him?
Thanks, Maurício.
Thanks, Amanda.
Good night.
Let's go, Amanda.
Maurício sent you this.
Everything I do,
I do it to protect you.
One day, you won't have
to sleep here alone.
But it's still too soon.
What was her name?
Your mother's name was Ana.
She was very kind-hearted.
She liked to dance.
Like you.
And she was beautiful.
Like you are.
Where did she live?
She lived near the bridge.
Across the river.
How did she die?
When you're older, I'll tell you.
Everything.
How about myy father?
I know nothing about him.
Enough! Give me back my treasure!
Never! This island is mine!
I...
I am your brother.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Bravo!
Well done, boys!
I'm sorry I hit you so hard.
It's OK. It happens.
How do you clip your nails like that?
- I bite them.
- Really?
- Hi, Joel.
- Hi, Maurício.
- Hi, Amanda.
- Hi, Julinha.
We're waiting for you
for the square dance.
Will you be long?
Maurício is hurt.
We won't be able to rehearse.
No, of course...
Poor thing!
Are you OK, Maurício?
I am, Julinha.
It's starting.
We'll wait for you there, OK?
- OK.
- Bye.
Maurício.
You know how to get to town, right?
Where in town?
The mall.
After the bridge.
I do. Why?
I want to look for someone.
You wanna go?
Please mind the gap
between the train and the platform.
Joel?
Sorry.
- Excuse me. How are you?
- Hello, Clara.
Have you seen Joel?
The class finished a while ago.
We were rehearsing the square dance.
But Joel didn't come,
he said he wouldn't be able to dance.
Didn't he go home?
Welcome to the Crystal Woods Mall.
Where will we find your dad?
Look.
This is my only clue.
We'll have to look everywhere.
Let's find out where the store is.
- Mari B.?
- That's it.
It doesn't exist anymore.
Really?
Is there anyone with you?
Where's your mother?
Over there.
Can I help you?
Are these kids with you?
Yes.
Let's keep on searching.
There's nobody home.
You checked the school?
I went there.
Joel and Maurício had already left.
They must be hanging around
on the streets.
Joel always goes straight home.
Don't worry.
Kids do that kind of thing.
Listen, can you do me a favor?
I'm gonna drive someone to the airport.
When Maurício turns up, tell him
I left some money on the table.
OK.
Can I give you my phone number
in case Maurício gets in touch?
Here, that's my number.
Send me a text message,
your number will be saved.
Relax.
They'll soon be hungry
and come back home.
Amanda,
did you speak to Joel today?
Didn't he tell you anything?
No, is he OK?
Go to bed, Amanda.
You're getting up early tomorrow.
Clara, have you been
at the police station?
They can contact hospitals,
that kind of thing.
No. There's no need for that.
Good night.
Good night, Clara.
It's getting late.
We'll go in a minute.
Let's stay a bit longer.
Joel, it's that lady again.
Come!
Good idea!
Dear customers,
soon we'll be finishing
our daily activities.
Crystal Woods Mall thanks you
and wishes you a good night.
- I think she's back.
- Great.
Clara.
Someone's here to see you.
- Ângela?!
- I tried to call you.
I couldn't close the cash register.
The card machine requires a code.
You didn't close it?
You said you'd be back.
I've never done that by myself.
Go back there,
lock up, put the money in the safe.
The code for the machine is 2306.
- OK. 23...
- 06!
You must fend for yourself.
I'm training you for that.
I can't watch you 24 hours a day!
Clara, are you OK?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
OK.
I'll run back there right now.
Thank you, Dona...
What happened?
Where's Joel?
Joel?
Are you alive?
Yes.
We're fucked.
Joel's father!
You're too uptight.
Excuse me, I'll take this.
Thanks.
So which one do you want?
None.
I'll get Guarana soda.
It'll pep you up.
Go on.
Drink it.
You're weird.
Let's go!
Relax.
Joel?
Are you OK?
I want to go home!
Calm down, we have to wait
for the first train.
Joel...
you're scaring me.
What's that on your hand?
A glove?
Did you take it from the store?
Every hour that goes by
Rends my heart
Hear, dear God, this prayer
Bring me back my boy
Lighten up his path
Protect him from the thorns
Silence here resounds
Soothe, dear God, our wait
Since you were born
You've been mine
I gave you my breast
Don't run away from me like this
Hear me, catch my smell
My son
Come back in one piece
Come back, I'll heal you
But come back through the shadows
Beware of the hunter
Come back
following the scent of my pain
It's the breadcrumbs
I scattered along the way
Come back, darling, to your nest
You are not alone
Follow the breadcrumbs
Don't get lost along the way
Come back, darling, to your nest
You are not alone
The clock won't speed up
This wait is tearing me apart
But our prayer persists
Resist
Wait
Wait
Wait
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Clara?
He's alive.
Thank God.
Where did you find him, Clara?
I told you
we should have had him baptized.
No!
I'll call the priest.
Pérola?
I'm sorry I'm calling you this late.
I need Father Zezinho's phone number.
Do you have it?
Could you look for it?
Yes, I'll wait.
It's an emergency.
Thank you.
Dona Amélia...
You'll call no priest.
Yes, I will.
We have to sort this out.
We're talking about a werewolf.
He has to be exorcized, Clara.
Yeah?
I'll wait.
You're only going to sleep for a while.
Joel?
- Come here.
- I'll do it.
- We're late for school.
- You're not going.
Where were you yesterday?
With Maurício.
Where?
I was looking for my father.
We went by train.
Maurício knew the way.
It was far away.
How did you two get back?
How did you get back, Joel?
I can't remember...
I had a strange dream.
With Maurício.
He was holding the sword.
Can I call him?
Drink this milk and let's go.
I'm never hungry
in the morning.
At night...
in the little bedroom, I feel hungry.
If you leave some food there,
I'll eat it.
I feel hungry at night.
- Where are we going?
- We're running away.
- Why?
- We can't stay here anymore.
- Why?
- Enough!
Come on, let's go!
- I don't want to!
- But we're going!
I hate you!
Joel.
Are you ready?
I want to take the lights.
Joel?
Open the door!
Joel.
Open this door right now!
Open the door right now, Joel!
Hi, Clara.
I'm worried, I want to know
if things were fine last night.
Please, call me back.
Blood everywhere.
In the elevator, on the ceiling.
It was disgusting.
But I didn't see a body.
There were only blood puddles
everywhere.
The police haven't confirmed it.
But no one
is allowed past this point.
Good morning, Joel.
Hi, Joel.
How are you?
Did you mother tell you off
yesterday?
You disappeared.
She did.
What were you up to?
Nothing.
We were only playing.
Who are you going to dance with?
I don't know.
Two boys asked me to dance with them.
Did you lose the present I gave you?
Would you like to dance with me?
What do you mean?
Did your mother let you?
Clara?
Clara?
Are you in there?
Ângela!
Thank you.
Joel...
Where is Joel?
What do you mean?
What happened?
Who locked you up here?
I think I know where he's gone.
Joel, pay attention!
Hold your hat over my head!
"It's raining!"
Your attention, please!
In a few minutes, we'll be watching
our pupils' square dance.
As well as the wedding.
It's such a good party
that even the priest will join in!
Clara!
Have you found Joel?
Yes, I have. Thanks.
Maurício hasn't come back home.
The money is still there.
He must be around.
You were right.
Kids are like that.
- Now, just get down on your knees.
- OK.
This is my favorite part.
Of course it is, you do nothing.
"Here's the dance ball!"
Come on, Joel. Let's go.
Let's go, the dance is about to start!
Joel, are you OK?
You're hurting me.
Get out...
of here!
Ladies and gentlemen
meet at the center
and do the gallop around the bonfire!
Balancé, dancing on the spot.
That's right!
Wait, wait! Stop the music.
Amanda, what happened, pumpkin?
Calm down.
This will pass.
Sleep on the ground
Sleep on the hay
Sleep, my little horse
You've been alive
for just a day
Run in the meadow
Run on the grass
Run, my little horse
For this world is so vast
Fly, little darling
Mother knows best
Fly, my little bird
This is a cage, not your nest
If you're afraid
Just sing out loud
Fly, my little bird
Go out and find the clouds
Night has fallen
The world is pitch-dark
Baby better go to bed
Sleep in the cradle
Sleep in the hammock
Sleep, my little child
So that you won't feel thirsty
If you're afraid
Call out my name
Sleep, my little child
So that you won't feel
Hungry
I don't want you to feel hungry.
