 Okay, here's one.
 Blue Volkswagen?
- No.
 Yellow Ford?
No.
 Red Chrysler?
 Don't worry about what kind of car.
That's impossible.
 Black?
- Nope.
 White?
- No.
 Red?
- No.
 Blue?
- No.
 Red?
- No.
 Black?
- No.
 I give up!
- Don't give up.
 All right, let me do it.
 Black.
- Yeah.
 White.
 Silver. Black.
 Yeah.
 White. Black.
 I think I hear a truck coming.
 Oh, you're so good.
How can you do it?
 How does she do it?
How does she do it?
 Try again.
 Silver.
- Yes.
 My God. Are you peeking?
You're cheating!
 I'm not peeking!
I can't see through my hands.
 You must be doing this or something.
 I can see you in the
rear-view mirror. She can't see.
 Okay, ready?
 Yellow and silver.
 She's too good.
- It's not fair!
 Some people have second sight.
 It's true some people can sense things.
 Right, come on.
 Make sure she can't see.
 Black. Silver.
 How do you do that?
 I'm David Blaine.
 You're not like David Blaine.
You're cheating.
 Are you cheating?
- Bad loser.
 Silver.
- Yes.
 Black.
 I think your hands are
see-through, honey.
 They are.
- You've got see-through little fingers.
 White.
 It's not fair!
She's looking, isn't she?
 Mary!
 No! No!
 Mum! Mum.
 Mummy!
 It's all right, sweetie.
It's okay, sweetheart.
 Mummy!
- It's okay. It's okay.
 I want mummy to come back!
 Mum!
 I want mummy to come back! Mummy!
 Mummy!
 It is a terrible shock
when a life is cut short.
 When a daughter -- who should
outlive her parents dies.
 We are here today -- to share
our grief together...
 and to pay tribute to Marianne's life.
 To myself and Laura, Marianne
was a wonderful loving daughter.
 To Joe -- a beautiful wife.
 Though perhaps most of all
to Kelly and Mary...
 a devoted mother.
 In her beautiful daughters
perhaps a little of Marianne
 lives on with us here today
 One of Marianne's great loves
was her love of music.
 She took great joy in passing
on this enthusiasm to her students
 and enthusiasm is contagious.
It's a wonderful gift.
 A natural gift for a teacher.
 Marianne loved to share her
love of music with everyone.
 I can't do science.
I can't even construct a sentence.
 You know, it should be easier,
right, the downhill... but I find...
 We're going outside, okay?
 Yeah, yeah. Wrap up, okay?
A coat and a scarf.
 I know, dad.
 It's a miracle they survived.
 Are you doing all right?
- Yeah. I'm hanging in there.
 Thank you so much.
 Fuck, it's freezing!
 So, what are you working on?
 Applying for grants.
 But nobody is reading
poetry any more
 I read a bit.
 Hey, guys, what's up?
 Thanks.
 Haven't done this in a while.
 Are you fucking serious?
 Oh my God!
 Are you okay?
- How did that happen?
 You want another hit?
Make you better.
 Don't be dumb.
 Joe, I'm so sorry about Marianne.
 Hiya, Joe.
 Joe, I'm really sorry.
 When are you due?
- The 13th.
 Oh my God.
- Soon.
 It is. It is.
 Can I do anything?
 No, I'm okay.
 Oh my God. Stop. Stop!
 Look at how well I can skate now.
 You're doing great.
I didn't recognise you.
 (5 MONTHS LATER)
 They said "Thank you".
 Barbara is an old friend.
I've known her forever.
 She's arranged for me to teach
at the university there.
 You don't seem very impressed.
 No, I'm just envious.
 But going away isn't a cure.
 Well, I'm not sick.
 What do the girls say?
 I think a year in Italy at their
age would be fantastic.
 Do them a lot of good.
Give them a language.
 Look, we'll go crazy if
we stay in the apartment.
 Well...
 There is a big difference between leaving
the apartment and leaving the country.
 Are you sure it's such a good idea
to uproot the girls?
 Watch out.
 We're off, we're off,
we're off on a holiday
 Dad! Please, dad,
you're so embarrassing.
 Oh, we're off, we're off...
 Stop it!
 It says here that Genova used to
be the richest city in the world.
 Really?
 Well, yeah, they invented the bank
and all the money came to them.
 Excuse me, madam, could you please
switch off your iPod for landing?
 Is it your ears?
 Excuse me.
- Yes, sir?
 Do you have anything like a sweet
or something she could suck on?
 I'll have a look.
 Dad, it hurts.
 Try holding your nose.
Now close your mouth and blow.
 See if that helps. Okay.
 Did you know Christopher Columbus
was from here?
 I thought he was from Spain.
 No, he was born here,
but he sailed from Spain...
 so that's why South America
is Spanish and not Italian.
 Mary, you've never
been to Italy before, have you?
 No.
 Do you like pasta?
- Yeah.
 Do you like ice-cream?
Then you'll be fine.
 So, why are there so many
English flags?
 They're not English.
They're the flags of St George.
 St George is the patron saint of Genova
 and England actually just borrowed him.
 You're better than this guidebook.
 Oh, thanks.
It comes with the territory.
 A lot of the courses that we teach
actually have a strong cultural element.
 So when does the teaching start?
 Oh, not for a week.
 Anyway, I've found you an apartment
and it's near the university.
 It's not perfect,
but I think you'll like it.
 It's great, thank you.
 So what do you two wanna do...
 before school starts?
You have the whole summer.
 I'd wanna just spend my summer
sleeping, relaxing, tanning...
 Now there's a surprise!
 Vacationing in Italy.
 That sounds good.
What else am I supposed to do?
 They play the piano.
 I could organise piano lessons.
 It would be something to do.
You don't wanna lie in bed all day.
 I don't?
 And who told you that?
- I should have known better.
 Your mum taught piano,
didn't she? Or music?
 At the university she taught piano.
 Look, really, I feel strange
not saying anything...
 I really wanted to say I'm so sorry
about what happened.
 It must have been terrible.
 Thank you.
 That was great. Thank you.
 You're welcome.
- Old town sounds nice. Is it?
 Yeah, it's beautiful.
 This is the Strada Nuova.
It's the new street.
 It's amazing.
 You like it?
It was built in the 16th century.
 It's not that new.
 It's said that one third
of all the silver from the New World
 ended up in these houses.
 Wow. That's a lot of silver.
 Just gonna go down here. This is
the old town, the mediaeval town.
 And you have to be...
extremely careful here
 because it's very easy to get lost
in these alleys
 How many years have you lived here?
 I've been here a long time
but now I have to leave.
 My son asked me
to move to Piedmonte.
 It's a shame I have to
leave this house.
 My heart bleeds.
 Let's go and see the house.
 He can't hear very well,
you have to speak up.
 It's quite nice.
 You wanna come and see the kitchen?
 Which is nice.
It's very big and...
 You get the sun here in the morning.
 Kelly?
 Yeah?
- Come and have a look at this.
 You two could share this room.
 Why would we share a room?
There's another one down there.
 I'd rather be in a small room
than share with her.
 You could sleep in this bed
on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays
 and that one on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
 Or if she pees in one she can sleep
in the other. - Don't be horrible.
 Just being honest.
 It will be fun to have
a room by myself.
 It's a beautiful city.
 Food processor.
 Something for the kitchen. We're not
going clothes shopping today.
 We can go in there and
you and I can both get something.
 Nice try.
 You can go book shopping and
I can go clothes shopping.
 Are you okay?
 Kelly.
 That's enough.
 Kelly, can you pick your plate up?
 How hungry are you?
 I'm pretty hungry.
- Hungry.
 That's good.
 Water into wine. There you go.
- Thanks.
 Apparently it's bad luck
to toast with water.
 Are you gonna wish me luck?
- Good luck.
 And to your first piano class.
 Yeah, thanks.
 How come you never
cooked this at home?
 Well... this was a voyage
of discovery for me.
 Dad?
- Yes?
 Can I have some of your water?
 Yes.
 Night.
- Goodnight.
 Is it good?
- Yeah.
 Shall I close the window?
Is it too noisy?
 It's hot.
 Ready for lights off? .
 Goodnight, sweetheart.
- Goodnight.
 Love you.
- Love you, too.
 Goodnight.
 Sleep well.
 I love you.
- I love you, too.
 Mum! Mum!
 Mum!
 Mum! Mum!
 It's okay.
 It's okay, sweetheart.
I'm here. Okay.
 Come on, come on.
 Come on, sweetheart.
 Mummy. Mummy!
 So this map is turning out
to be completely useless.
 Should be down here somewhere.
 What do you say? Right or left?
 Left.
 Barbara said it was past a small church.
 Yeah, but we've passed
a thousand churches already.
 This is it.
 Yeah, that's the church.
Not now. Come on, girls.
 Come on, we gotta get moving.
 Come on, girls.
 Here we are.
 Hello.
 Nice to meet you. I'm Gerry.
- I'm Joe.
 Monica.
 Monica, Angelica, Carlo.
 Hello, Angelica, ciao.
 My students are on summer.
 No, I can get us home. I swear.
 No, I remember. I remember.
- Do you want the map?
 No, no.
- Sure?
 Bye, girls.
- Bye, dad.
 So, who's gonna defend Italy's honour?
 I think the article is right.
Most people behave in a crazy way.
 People all want to do exactly the same
thing at exactly the same time.
 That is a really Italian thing.
 Italians are conformists.
- Yes.
 No, I don't agree.
 We are here. Not on the beach.
We are the proof.
 And what's wrong with going to the beach?
 Nothing. We are all going there after...
 Even though all the young people,
we use condoms now...
 Everybody use condoms,
but the Pope...
 He continue to say 'no'
for years and years.
 Is it rather like having a parent
that you... can rebel against?
 Everybody says "We are not conformist"
 But everybody is.
 Right, Chopin.
- Yeah.
 It's been a really long time
since I've played.
 I can't read Italian.
 Come on.
 Are you sure this is the right way?
 Yeah.
 Fuck!
 Come here.
 It's that way.
 No, it's this way.
 Hi. So, would you like to
join us for a coffee?
 I'd love to. I have to rush
because I've got children.
 Next time maybe. Thank you.
- Yes, okay.
 Thank you.
- Bye.
 Hi, daddy.
 Hi. How was it?
- It was fine.
 Was he okay?
 Yeah, it was fine.
 Did you enjoy it?
 Yeah, they have two really cute kids.
 They're so funny.
We got lost on the way home.
 No, we didn't.
Can we go to the beach?
 Do you wanna eat here
or on the beach?
 On the beach.
- Here.
 Do you two never agree?
 Don't stick your head out.
 Hey... sea.
 Ciao.
- Ciao.
 How are you?
 I'm good. How are you?
 Fine, thanks. It's free, this?
 Yes, of course.
 We need to get in more shallow water.
- I'm going to shallow water now.
 So, it's not just Italian who likes
the beach, huh?
 40 million Italians
can't be wrong, huh?
 We are with some friends further up
the beach if you wanna join us.
 Okay. Well, my children are
in the sea at the moment.
 Okay.
- Maybe in a while?
 In the blue cafe at the end, okay?
 Okay, that will be nice.
 See you. Ciao.
- Ciao.
 I'm done.
 No, you're not.
Come on, please.
 I'm gonna go sunbathe, okay?
 Why?
 Because I wanna be alone
for a little bit.
 Can we get an ice-cream?
 You wanna go get an ice-cream?
- Yeah.
 How do you say ice-cream in Italian?
 I don't know. Un gelato, per favore?
 Very good.
 She's very beautiful, your daughter.
 Yes, she is.
 You must be very... proud?
 She's really tired.
 Hi, Mary.
 Dad... I wet the bed.
 So you did.
 You can go sleep in your
own bed if you want.
 Sure?
 Yeah, I'll be all right.
 You guys.
 I'm gonna go out for a little walk
and I'll be back by 12.
 Ciao.
- Ciao.
 Okay, at the beginning.
No, no. Adagio. Adagio.
 Sorry I'm late.
- It's all right.
 So, how long have we got?
 An hour.
 Let's go, darlin'.
 Darling!
 Hi, Kelly, come in.
 Mary, Kelly is coming up.
 Ciao, Angelica. Ciao, Carlo.
 I'm so sorry I'm late.
 Where did you go?
 Just for a walk.
 Where?
 Just shopping.
 Who with?
 No one.
 If you don't tell me,
I'm telling dad.
 Don't you threaten me.
 Wait!
 We might not get to the beach today.
 Why not?
 We have to go to a reception.
It is for the Governor of Ligurias.
 Why do Mary and I have to go?
 I promised Barbara.
 There's a church that she
wants to show Mary nearby.
 I have to go to this boring party
because of you and Mary?
 Do you know, you're really selfish!
 Fine.
 You need to be ready
in 15 minutes, okay?
 It's beautiful.
 Thanks.
- What's that?
 Venice and Genova were the two
biggest trading cities in Italy.
 Did they fight wars?
 Just over trade. Yeah.
 And Marco Polo actually
was imprisoned here...
 with seven thousand other Venetians.
 God, it smells like urine.
 Pretty flowers.
 Yeah, they're nice.
 They're for the dead.
Somebody must have died there.
 So, when you guys go to the
reception can I just leave?
 What do you mean "leave"? Where?
 I'm just going to a cafÃ©
with some friends.
 Who?
 It's the boys and the girls
that we met with Rosa.
 That's the Annunciation.
 That's what the basilica
was named after.
 What's happening?
 That's when Archangel Gabriel comes
down from heaven... and tells Mary
 that she's gonna be
the mother of Jesus.
 Because she's never had sex so
she's like "How could I be pregnant?".
 She had a cousin named Elizabeth.
 She was barren and...
but she had just become pregnant
 with John the Baptist.
 What does barren mean?
 Well, it's when a woman
can't become pregnant.
 Do you wanna light a candle?
- Yeah.
 I will give you some money.
 That was a good one.
 Do you believe in life after death?
 You mean like heaven?
- Yeah.
 I like to think that people just
live on in other people's memories.
 It's not a funeral, okay,
it's a boring party.
 Stephen.
 Nice to see you.
You look beautiful. Beautiful.
 This is Kelly and Mary and Joe.
 Joe is here teaching
at the university.
 I think me and Mary are gonna
go mingle.
 Where did you two meet?
 Well, we actually met at Harvard...
 ...years ago.
 You speak Italian? Is that
why you're teaching here?
 Not very well.
 If you wanna understand about Italy,
you have to learn the language.
 Thank you.
 You know what they call...
what do they call Genova?
 La Superba.
 Sorry, I just better check
on the...
 We should all get together sometime.
We'll have you over for dinner.
 That would be great.
 Welcome you properly
to La Superba. Okay.
 Did you two have a thing at Harvard?
 No, these tall guys, you know...
 Have you two met?
 Tall women are different.
 Tall women are good.
 I've found you.
 Oh, thank God!
I'm leaving, okay?
 Yeah, can we come with you?
- No.
 I'm just joking.
 Now, we're gonna be back at
the apartment in an hour.
 You'll be back by ten, okay?
 Why?
 Because it's a strange city.
You don't know your way around.
 But you brought me here.
- No, ten.
 Hi... Sorry.
 Do you smoke?
 Thank you.
 No mirror... dammit!
 No.
 I should go.
 Bye.
- Bye.
 You're late.
 Sorry. Goodnight.
 So, has the euro had any impact on
the Italian sense of identity?
 Do you feel more European,
less Italian?
 We don't have just one identity
any more.
 I can feel Italian and European...
 and Genovese because...
 I study here, but...
 Neapolitan, too, because
I am from Naples.
 Or a woman and a bourgeois.
 But what's the most important?
 Neapolitana,
 or being bourgeois,
radical, Italian or...
 A woman.
 Okay...
 We have fun not like you.
 Look, there's a village set into
the edge of the cliffs there.
 Do you see that?
 I think I'm gonna go
for a swim. Okay?
 Have fun.
 Try one, Mary, it's really good.
 And why would I wanna eat it?
 Shall we go to the monastery?
- Sure.
 I'll stay with Kelly.
 Cicadas are loud.
 Look.
 Why did they choose to build
the monastery here?
 I guess as a retreat, you know.
They wanted a retreat from the world.
 They just wanted to live for God.
 Some monks took a vow of silence.
They didn't even talk to each other.
 That must be strange.
 I'd hate it. Although some people...
 might be glad as I tend to
talk a little too much.
 I like listening to your talk.
 Did you get burnt?
 No. I'm a professional candle lighter.
 I'm gonna light one for my mum.
 Kelly... You all right?
 Dad! Go away!
 Don't be too long, okay?
 Light.
 There you go. That's good.
 I was in the car when mummy died.
 I know... It must have been awful.
 She comes to me sometimes.
 Really?
 Yeah. Don't tell anyone.
 I won't. Not if you don't
want me to, I won't.
 She comes to forgive me.
 You have nothing to be forgiven
about. It wasn't your fault.
 You didn't do anything.
It was an accident.
 A terrible accident.
 I did. It was my fault.
 No. No.
- Yes.
 Mary.
- It was my fault.
 So, are you gonna tell me
about your new friends?
 They're not really friends.
I just met them.
 But I'm gonna go to a party
with them later tonight.
 Oh, really? Topless party?
 I just think you might have asked.
 Okay.
 Excuse me. Have you seen a girl?
 No? Thank you.
 Is Mary with you?
 No, I thought she was with you.
 She was. She ran off.
 She is sensible.
She'll find her way back.
 I think we should go look for her.
 Hey, what's going on?
 Mary has gone.
 Mary wandered off, so we're gonna go
and have a little look for her, okay?
 Well, she's a sensible girl.
I'm sure she'll find her way back.
 All right. I'll stay here.
- Yes.
 How long ago was it?
- Just now.
 So what happened?
 I don't know.
I think the church spooked her.
 God, I feel terrible.
 Where does this path lead?
 To Santa Margherita, I think.
 Go and get Kelly...
get the last boat back. Okay?
 And then I think you should probably
tell the police in Camogli.
 And I'll see you back
at the flat. Okay?
 We'll just... I'll meet you there.
 Okay. But what are you gonna do?
 I'm gonna walk to Santa Margherita.
 Take care.
- Okay.
 Oh, fuck!
 Mary?!
 Mary?
 Mary?
 Mary!
 Mary!
 Mary?
 Mary!
 Mary!
 Mary?
 Did you find her?
 Mary with you?
 No. No, I'm gonna get the train.
I'm on my way.
 Mary!
 Dad!
 You're okay.
 Is she okay?
 Yeah.
She fell asleep on the train.
 They're back.
- Oh, great.
 Is she okay?
 Yeah. She's completely out cold.
 I love you.
- I love you, too.
 Man, this song. I just...
 I think of school.
 What was the name of
that band you were in?
 That fucking awful band.
 Jesus, not one of us could play!
 No.
- Here, give me a puff of that.
 It was good.
You were great, really.
 God, I was such a nerd, man.
I studied so hard and...
 but you just...
 I was so jealous of you
and your academic career.
 Don't you have an academic career?
 Not a serious one.
 Nobody has a serious academic career.
 No?
 What actually happened?
 We went to the monastery...
 ...and...
 I think something made her think of
Marianne and she just took off.
 Did she say anything?
 We lit a candle and then
she just disappeared.
 You know, Mary has a very lively
imagination and mabye...
 lighting candles for dead people
isn't what she needs right now.
 Yeah, maybe.
 Listen, I'm just, I'm very...
 I'm so sorry about today. Really.
 It must be incredibly hard for all
of you. They're beautiful kids.
 Did they have counselling?
 Yeah, they saw someone
after the accident.
 You're all very brave.
 Yeah, well, we don't have much choice
- No.
 I need to go to bed.
 I'll go. I should go.
 I just think that, you know,
she feels very,
 very guilty about Marianne...
 Joe, and I think that she needs help.
 Maybe.
- Okay.
 I'm sorry. Goodnight.
 You need a cab?
 No, I'm okay. Thanks.
- Sure?
 Yeah. The walk will do me good.
- Now, listen, take care.
 I will. Thanks. You.
 Bye.
 Who's he?
 He's nobody.
 Is he your boyfriend?
 No.
 Yeah, right.
 Don't even fucking talk to me!
And don't walk next to me either!
 Was Barbara your girlfriend
at the university?
 No.
 She wants to be.
 Don't be silly.
 Did you make out?
- Look, what is this?
 Did you go to dances?
- Did you two plan this?
 It was 20 years ago.
 At least.
 Yeah, okay, thank you very much.
 Why don't we talk about some of
Kelly's boyfriends?
 No, thanks.
 That would be much more
interesting conversation.
 Did you kiss?
 No, we did not kiss.
 (smelly KELLY)
 That was too long.
 I see you.
 She enjoy it, huh?
- Yeah.
 Watch again.
 You're a very good swimmer.
 What about her mother?
Is she in America?
 No, her mother died. About
six months ago. Car accident.
 I'm sorry.
 Children are very strong, I think.
 Kelly? Kelly?
 Remember we've got to go and visit
the school this afternoon, okay?
 Fine.
 Pretty strict about being on time,
so we have to hurry.
 Hi, dad.
 Let's start the tour.
Let's go this way.
 How many students are there?
 About 700.
 In this school we do the
international baccalaureate.
 Here is where we teach biochemistry.
 For us, chemistry and biology
are very important subjects.
 We like our students to be the best.
 Are all the lessons in English?
 They also have to learn Italian.
 So one subject they do will
be taught entirely in Italian.
 I don't want to have to set
foot in that school again.
 I'm not going there.
 I'll go back to Chicago.
 Well, that's very eloquent.
 You look tired.
 I don't feel tired.
 Having trouble getting up
in the morning.
 Maybe you should stay in tonight.
 Thank you.
 Sure you don't want ice-cream?
 No, I don't want ice-cream!
 I'm sick of you treating me
like I'm some stupid child.
 What the fuck are you looking
at? This is all...
 This is all her fault!
 I'm going to the bathroom.
 I'm not having that
kind of language.
 Are you okay? Huh?
You two okay?
 Sure.
 Okay, time to brush your teeth.
Come on.
 Can I finish the sentence?
- No, you can't.
 If you're very quick you can
have another ten minutes.
 All right.
 Young lady, we need to have a conversation
about the state of your room.
 What happened here?
 Fabio... Cuba libra.
 So, when I saw you on the station
in Santa Margherita,
 what were you doing there?
 Why do you ask?
 Well, I don't know.
 The platform was for the trains
going the other direction.
 Which pictures did you see?
 Lots.
 I saw mummy.
She was on the platform.
 Do you see her a lot?
 Sometimes.
 Do you talk to Kelly about mum?
 No, not really.
 No one ever talks about her. It's like
we're pretending she never existed.
 Who pretends she never existed?
 It's hard to know what to say.
Or when to say it.
 Do you miss her?
 Yes, I do. Course I do.
All the time.
 All the time?
Every hour of every day?
 Every day of every month,
every month of every year...
 All right, no, not every hour of...
 ...every decade of every century?
 And every century of every millennium?
 Momma wants you to be happy, you know.
 I know. That's what she tells me.
 I'm happy when I'm with her.
 Talks to you?
 Yes.
 What does she say about me?
 Dad!
 Hello, mummy.
 Is everything okay?
- Yes.
 You know I love you.
 I love you, too.
 Go to sleep.
- Okay.
 Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
 Sorry. I forgot my keys.
 Joe... hi.
 How are you?
 Well. You?
 Do you wanna have a coffee?
 We're all going to the cafÃ© across the
street. Would you like to join us?
 Sure. If it's okay?
 Yeah.
- We can go somewhere else.
 No, no... love to.
 Ciao.
 Well done, Mary.
 Goodbye, children.
 Are you okay?
How is the summer course going?
 It's going okay. But I'm a bit tired.
 Joe? Joe?
 Would you like something?
 Just a water. Flat water.
 Are you getting all the students drunk?
 Are we going to the disco?
 Kelly.
 What the fuck are you doing?
Have you just been standing there?
 You little piece of shit!
Are you fucking spying on me?
 You better not say anything to
fucking dad because I will kill you!
 I'll fucking ruin your entire life
like you did mine!
 Piece of fucking shit!
 Good day, pretty girls.
 Hiya, daddy.
 I made you spaghetti carbonara.
 Really?
 Spoil me.
Who taught you how to do this?
 Mum.
 Look what your sister has produced.
 Looks good.
 How was piano?
 Good. I finally got to
the end of the piece.
 Congratulations. That's fantastic.
- Thank you.
 So when can I come and listen?
 Soon.
 God, this is exactly
what the doctor ordered.
 When forty winters
shall besiege thy brow,
 And dig deep trenches
in thy beauty's field.
 Thy youth's proud livery,
so gazed on now,
 Will be a tatter'd weed
of small worth held.
 Then being asked where
all thy beauty lies,
 Where all the treasure
of thy lusty days,
 To say within thine own
deep-sunken eyes.
 Were an all-eating shame
and thriftless praise,
 How much more praise
deserv'd thy beauty's use,
 If thou couldst answer...
'This fair child of mine
 Shall sum my count,
and make my old excuse'
 Proving his beauty
by succession thine!
 This were to be new made
when thou art old.
 And see thy blood warm when
thou feel'st it cold.
 Just write a description of your...
 feelings when you hear that,
or read that sonnet.
 It is your last assignment so
you can get away with anything.
 Maybe we can do something special
on Friday for the end of the course.
 Sure, sounds good.
 Just the two of us... maybe.
 Okay.
 Okay. Ciao.
- Ciao.
 How are you?
 I'm good. How are you?
 Good, I'm excited.
Thank you for inviting me.
 It was beautiful.
 Would it be okay for the girls
to stay a bit later on Friday?
 It's the last day of the course
 and the students have suggested
we have a drink.
 You must be Mr Popular.
 We're going to Milan
to visit my parents.
 At four.
 Okay.
- At four.
 Yeah, I'll be back by four.
That's fine.
 It's okay, right?
- Yeah.
 Got a little party thing.
 I didn't know your class was
having a party on Friday.
 It's not a party, it's just lunch.
 With Rosa?
 Oh God, it's just a lunch!
 Don't feel guilty. If you're
seeing her, it's fine.
 Just trying to keep things a bit
vague for the children.
 Don't you think it's better
to be open and honest with people?
 Children, especially?
 You've been very kind and helpful,
but I do not need your advice, okay?
 This is my turn.
I'll see you later.
 Thank you for the concert. Bye.
 Ciao.
 Ciao.
 You played beautifully today.
I'm so proud of you.
 Kelly plays better.
 Well, she's older.
 I think she'll be a really good pianist
just like you when she grows up.
 Silver.
 Black.
 I don't wanna go to school here,
mummy.
 Why not?
 I wanna be with you.
 Mummy! Mummy! No! No!
 Don't leave me! Mummy!
 It's all right.
- Mummy...
 It's all right, my darling,
I'm here. It's okay.
 Mummy!
- Okay. You're okay.
 Mummy!
 Mummy!
 You know, it doesn't matter what
happened. I love you.
 And I'm so sorry you were in
that car when it crashed.
 It's a terrible thing, but it's
happened and it's done.
 And it's over.
 You should get ready, sweetie.
 Come on. I don't want you to be late.
Now I've got to go.
 You're wearing perfume.
- It's aftershave.
 So, I'll see you at Gerry's
at four, okay?
 Okay, daddy.
- Bye.
 Bye. Have fun with Rosa.
 What's that supposed to mean?
 That's who you're having
lunch with, right?
 Oh, is it? Who told you that?
 Lorenzo. They're friends,
remember?
 Ciao, Monica.
- Ciao.
 I'll be back by four to get her.
 Ciao, Kelly.
 Okay, ciao.
Bye.
 Here I am.
- There you are.
 Are you sitting with us?
 Look what Alessandro has made us.
 When I first come in Genova
as a student...
 I used to work here.
 That's why I know them
like a family, no?
 I bring here just people
that I really like.
 Do you wanna go for a swim?
 I can't because I have to
go back soon.
 Soon, why?
 Because I have to be back by four.
 Where are we going?
 Don't you worry.
 Monica.
- Yes?
 I'm going to look for a taxi.
 Lorenzo, I need to go!
 I don't need to go.
 What do you mean,
you don't need to go?
 Means that it's the middle of the day.
Why do we need to go?
 How else am I supposed to get back?
 Why bring me here if you
weren't gonna take me back?
 Do I look like a taxi driver?
 I can walk by myself.
 Are you sure?
 I've done it before.
Really, I'll be fine.
 There is a station in the next town.
So, if you wanna go...
 And how far is that?
 Three... four kilometres.
Something like that.
 Are you gonna take me there?
- No way.
 You know what? Fuck you!
 Kelly! Kelly!
 You okay?
- No.
 Do you have an actual helmet?
 No problem, no problem.
 This church was built to give thanks
for the end of a plague.
 They wanted to pray for the souls
of the children who died...
 and to pray that no more
would be taken by God.
 And I wish that you could always
be with me forever.
 Amen.
 Mum?
 Joe, it's Barbara.
 Yeah?
 Monica just called. She's been trying
to get through to you.
 They've had to leave.
 Kelly wasn't back so Mary
has gone back the apartemnt by herself.
 Kelly supposed to be with Mary.
Where is she?
 I just saw her.
- Where?
 Is there a way down here?
I can't see a way down.
 Good luck.
 Mum!
 Mary!
 Mary!
 Oh my God! Oh my God.
I'm sorry.
 Are you okay?
 My baby. Are you all right?
 Are you all right, sweetie?
 Don't go. Don't go.
- No, I won't. I'm not going anywhere.
 No, no, no, see, they're all okay.
See?
 Let's go. Okay.
 So we have all the information
we need about the accident.
 We will pass on the report to
our commanding officer.
 We may need to pass on the information
to our insurance companies.
 But for the moment
everything is in order.
 Right. Yeah.
Thanks for your help.
 I'll see you at work then.
Or whenever.
 I'll see you next week.
 Bye, darling.
 Bye, Barbara.
 Goodbye.
 ...it's "I would like". It's quite
a polite way to say it. Okay?
 "Please can you speak more slowly."
 But don't be afraid to say
"I don't understand", okay?
 People are gonna be nice to you.
They understand.
 Are you okay?
- Yeah.
 Nervous?
 A little.
 It's normal.
 Thank you.
 Ciao, daddy.
 Hey, you know it's traditional in Italy
to kiss your parents goodbye.
 Even when you're grown up.
 Bye, dad.
 You'll be fine.
 I love you.
- Love you, too.
