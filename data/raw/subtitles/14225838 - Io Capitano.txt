What if you stopped now?
We're having fun. If you don't like it, she goes back to sleep. Okay?
Mama!
That's beautiful. There's that other one too.
Yes, that.
Come on, put it on.
Turn around.
Yes, so you're fine. Yes!
- Careful! - Move those feet.
I have not done it on purpose.
Moussa!
Moussa, do you want to move? We must hurry.
Come on, hurry or we'll be late!
- How beautiful you are! - Do I like you?
- You look great. - Thank you.
- Beautiful, huh? - You there!
Give it back to me.
Give it back to me right away.
Come here! Give it back to me, I said.
Come on, give it back to me.
Here, like this.
Seydou.
Hi, Seydou!
- What's up? - Where are you going?
To play football.
Aren't you coming to Sabar?
I told you I had the game. When I finish, I come to Sabar.
- Do not be late. - Okay.
- Don't do as usual. - OK yes.
Moussa, will you stop counting them?
- Have you seen how many there are? - Yes, just count them.
We are almost there. Short time left!
You have to move though.
They're waiting for us at Sabar, hurry up.
Mom.
- Seydou! - Here you are!
- Seydou. - I really have to congratulate you.
- You say? - You did great!
- Hand! - Believe me.
Believe me.
Mom, I have to tell you something.
Speak, I'm here. I listen to you.
Mom, I want to leave.
I want to go out to work.
I didn't hear well.
Say it again, so I hear.
Mom, I want to leave.
I want to go to Europe to work, to help you.
Many have gone and succeeded.
They helped the families.
I want to become someone. I want to help you, give you a hand.
I love music.
There I can realize my dream, help my little sisters.
Look where they sleep, look at this house that's about to collapse.
- I want to help you. - Shut up!
Who told you these things?
Who put them in your head?
You don't need to leave.
You have to stay here and breathe the air I breathe.
"I want to leave, become someone, help you!"
If you want to help me, do it here.
Those who have succeeded are no better than me.
Don't tell me stories!
"Those who succeeded..."
Those who left died in the desert, in the middle of the sea.
There are dead bodies everywhere.
Do you have any idea how many died on those boats?
Seydou, do you have any idea about this?
Just kidding.
I would never leave, I would never leave you here.
Seydou, you don't think!
You are truly naive.
Come and tell me you want to leave here.
Mom, don't get mad, I was just joking.
Don't do that, mom.
Don't get angry, don't do that.
You are my mom and I love you. If you do that, I'll feel bad.
Give me a smile, come on! If you sulk, I won't recognize you.
A smile! You are my mommy.
Come on, a smile.
I love you.
Come on, don't do that.
Hey, Moussa. Wait!
Listen, were you the one who put the idea of ​​the trip into his head?
- As? - You're the one who recommends it.
- What? - Don't pretend, you know it very well.
- Yesterday he told me he wants to leave. - Start?
No, it doesn't exist.
I never even thought about it.
Start? No, not really.
Here you see?
Mom, I told you I was joking.
I told you I was joking, but you believed it.
Don't play dumb. Try not to make me angry.
I know what I'm saying.
- And don't put strange ideas in his head! - Aunt, I eat and drink.
I'm doing great. Nobody moves me from Senegal.
Start? There's no talking about it.
- View? He has nothing to do with it, as I told you. - I do not believe you.
It was just a joke.
I brought you into the world, I know you well.
And now go to school.
But how could you?
You know your mother, you know what she's like.
If he finds out, it's over.
I didn't say anything, I wanted to see his reaction.
We've been working for six months.
Think about it? Six months, secretly.
- I suffer at the idea of ​​leaving her. - Shut up!
You feel guilty and so do I, you know.
But we have no choice.
- I know, I didn't say a word. - Still, do you insist?
There's no point in getting angry, I didn't speak. Do not fight.
- We shouldn't argue. - Yes, that's enough. Friends.
- Do not do that. - Everything's fine.
Do not do that.
Cultural heritage is all the beautiful things that exist in the world.
These are things that, often, were born from someone's creative genius.
Things of inestimable value…
Ok.
Dad, come on.
Come on, get up!
- I love you. - Where?
- What? - Prove it to me.
Where is this love?
Look here.
I do not feel so well.
No I do not believe it.
Italian model, Italian beauty…
Seydou, where did you go?
I've been looking for you since this morning. Haven't you seen all my calls?
- No, I haven't seen them. - I'm in a hurry, come on!
- Otherwise I would have answered you. - Yes, certainly. Give me the change.
I didn't look at the phone.
Hi, Mama.
Wait, let's do something.
- What? - Did you hear my mother?
Did you hear it?
"I'm looking for you. Haven't you seen my calls?"
We can write a song about it.
Or.
This wind.
Here you are.
♪ I'm looking for you Haven't you seen my calls? ♪
♪ You never answer ♪
♪ I'm looking for you Haven't you seen my calls? ♪

Will he stay there?
Where is this Sisko?
But are you sure he's here?
Salāmu 'alaykum.
Alaykumu s-islands.
Are you Sisko?
What do you want?
We wanted information about the trip.
- Who told you I did it? - Some friends.
If I were you, I wouldn't leave.
Do you think Europe is better than Africa?
Europe is not what you imagine.
What you see on TV is not true.
In Europe it is very cold.
You walk and see people sleeping on the street.
That?
Are there people sleeping on the streets in Europe?
Do you think I'm lying?
- No no.
He thinks so.
No, we just came for the travel information.
- We just want some advice. - You'll see.
Dead mothers and children.
Criminals, bandits and thieves everywhere.
You walk and see corpses on the ground.
Dead brothers, husbands and wives.
If you want to die, go.
But how do you…
Do you want to die? Go.
Now enough with the questions.
- We just wanted… - Enough, I said.
- But we… - Get lost! Out!
So when you told me you wanted to leave it was all bullshit?
Were you not sincere?
Look into my eyes.
- Are you afraid of travel? Say that. - It's not that.
- It is not so. - Come on, admit it.
- And what is it? - Yes, I'm scared. Happy?
Here, that's how it is. Do you admit it?
All right.
Seydou, tell me the truth. Don't want to leave anymore?
We have been preparing for six months.
We did any work to leave.
What happens to our dreams?
I have no intention of leaving without you.
- I'm not leaving without you either. - So? Europe awaits us.
Think you're going to be a big star.
They'll scream your name like crazy and you'll sign autographs for white people.
You will perform on stage, like a star.
What the fuck!
But do you think about it? You smile.
Smile, come on.
Yes.
- You smile. - Yes, but I'm scared.
But I won't stay here without you.
Did you believe that madman?
- Have you seen the beard? - Certain.
Did you see how he banged?
I saw her.
- But I… - Smile!
- But he… - Come on, laugh.
He was punching the table so hard that I was coming...
He's crazy.
It's not this. She was screaming, she scared me.
- Did you piss yourself off? - Who? I do not.
But yes.
Wait.
- Before we leave, we'll do one thing. - That?
- One thing together. - All that you want.
- We'll do it together. - Yes.
You two have to go to the cemetery.
From the souls of the dead.
Once you arrive, ask for permission to leave.
Then, after three days, come back here.
But we are about to leave, we are in a hurry.
Three days is too long.
Three days, I tell you.
I will talk to them and tell you what they told me.
Yes.
And I will give you an answer.
I will give you an answer.
Salāmu 'alaykum, our ancestors. With respect, we greet you.
We are here to take refuge in your hands.
We are about to embark on a journey, we want to reach Europe.
We ask your permission to leave.
The journey is difficult and many die.
Therefore, we ask you to pray for us.
Above all, we ask you to take care of our families.
We leave without saying anything to our mothers.
We know that leaving secretly is wrong.
We ask our mothers to forgive us
for what we are doing.
We know it's not right.
You can leave.
Go.
- Let's play riddles. - Yes, let's play.
- Come on, think about it. - I do not know.
- I have it. - We feel.
- It has four legs, but it doesn't walk. -He doesn't walk and has four legs?
- The table. I guessed right! - Right.
The table has four legs, but does not walk.
- Still. - Maybe you can guess.
He's tall with lots of strings on him.
- It's the streetlight. - Let's change the game, I never guess.
- Another game. - You'll see, you'll guess the next one.
- You try again. - No, let's change.
- Shall I try again? - Yes, another one.
Seydou, where are you going?
Where are you going?
Listen, I'm going on a trip,
but I won't be gone long.
- I'll come back. - And will you take me with you?
If I take you with me,
who stays with mom?
If you come, who will he blame?
- With you, of course. - You see? With me.
And I'm in the middle of it.
Aren't you leaving anymore?
Not right away, in a while. Sleep.
Sleep.
Seydou.
There's a guy who makes our passport.
- Yes? - He can do that.
- At that time? - He wants 100 dollars.
- Are too many. - We have no choice.
Another!
Move around a bit.
Another! I don't have time to waste, quick.
You sit there!
How are you doing, madame? A little further to the right.
You have to see the face.
No, face down.
Another!
Yes, keep your head down.
Another!
Take off your hat.
Another! I have no time to lose.
Lower your face.
Another! I have no time.
One hundred dollars.
- Is less possible? - No, 100 dollars.
- But the money we have... - I'm not bargaining, it's 100 dollars.
- A little lonely. - I have no time to lose.
I'll call the next one now.
-Malick Mara. - Yes.
- Salif Bamba. - Yes.
You are Malians from today.
But we are Senegalese.
Be shy, show your passports at the border and go.
But if they ask us precise questions, they will understand…
It's not a problem, don't worry. Take out your passport and don't say a word.
Now you are Malians.
-Malick Mara? - Yes, Malick Mara is your name.
- Malian? - Salif Bamba.
- Salif Bamba. - Yes.
- Good luck! Call when you arrive. - Yes.
Okay. Another!
I have no time. Another!
Border police, show your passports.
Raise your head, quickly.
Faster.
Passport, monsieur?
- What is your name? - Salif Bamba.
- And you? - Malick Mara.
- And where are you going? - Agadez.
Agadez? And when did you get your passport?
It's already been two years.
- Two years? - Yes.
And you haven't changed your clothes for two years?
Did you take me for an idiot? You seriously risk prison.
The choice is yours, $50 or prison.
Fifty dollars?
Fifty dollars or prison, do I make myself clear?
The next!
Madame, get ready.
Libya?
Libya?
- In what sense? - I can take you directly.
- How much it does? - 400 each, 800 in total.
- What do you think about it? - $800 is too much.
But we travel in new cars, look.
Yes, it is guaranteed that you will arrive in Tripoli.
- In Tripoli? - Yes.
Then in Tripoli, we'll figure something out.
But if we continue like this, we won't have enough money for the trip.
What else can we do?
- Agree. - Hurry, it's illegal.
- Hurry. - But is it only up to Tripoli?
We can also get to Italy.
- In Italy? - Yes, in total there are 600 each.
- Just because you are my brothers. - Look at that boat!
- Let's go. - Yes we go.
- Where? - I don't do it with everyone, eh!
- Thank you. - Where?
Look, it's the car in front.
- The gray one? - Yes.
Yes, agreed.
Libya?
Libya?
Libya?
Come on, hurry.
Guys, quick.
So, you wait here.
Rest well.
When the cars are full, I'll pick you up and let's go.
- Okay? - Okay.
Come, guys, let's eat.
Make room.
Space.
Make room!
I warn you, the desert is very dangerous.
You have to be careful!
We will encounter groups of rebels
and as soon as they see your money, they will take it away from you.
So, the most important thing
it's hiding the money.
You have understood?
There are those who hide them in their shoes, those in their clothes, those who sew them on.
All this is fine, but they are professionals and they will find them for you.
Since you are Senegalese friends, I'll give you some advice on what awaits you.
So, there is a safe place where no one will be able to find them.
Never anyone.
You have to stick the money up your ass.
Hey, I told you.
If you don't want to, do it yourself. Congratulations!
That is, you take them and stick them in your ass?
No, you take the money and roll it up nice and tight. It is important that they are tight.
Form a cylinder with the cling film and push.
They slide better.
Listen, what I tell you, I do for you.
I gave you some advice. Whoever wants it accepts it and whoever doesn't want it doesn't.
But I tell you one thing, it's the best bank.
Good night.
It's me.
We're leaving tonight.
- Safe? - I swear.
- But it's true? - Of course yes.
At what time?
Tonight, I don't know what time.
- This is fine? - Take it.
Come on.
Let me see.
I agree with this?
Of course.
Do you hear?
- How much is it? - That 20.
Next time it's your turn.
To me? You can forget about it.
At that time? Did he come in?
Floor.
I'll give you a hand.
Who has the money?
- Come on. - Soon!
Hurry up!
Quick, go.
Force!
Walk!
Quick, don't waste time!
Where are you going?
To the left.
Go!
Stop!
He will die like this.
I told you to hold on tight.
Shut your mouth!
Come back, please.
Go back so he dies.
Go back!
Finitela!
Backwards!
Shut up!
Go back!
Get off!
Now continue on foot.
Follow him.
It takes you to Libya.
Follow him!
Come on, follow him.
You took our money and now you leave us in the desert.
- You are thieves. - Why do you do this?
You were supposed to take us in the car and now you abandon us.
Will you let us go on foot? I have a child, you can't abandon us.
Wait for me!
Wait for me!
I beg you. I can not handle it anymore!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
I can not do it.
Madame.
Seydou.
Come on let's go!
Madame?
Madame, get up. Let's go!
Seydou?
Seydou?
Madame?
Seydou?
Madame, get up.
Seydou!
Are you crazy?
The guide is leaving.
If we lose it, we will die in the desert.
That's for sure.
Seydou?
We are losing her.
Madame.
Madame?
Seydou?
Seydou.
Moussa!
Madame?
Madame.
Get up.
Floor!
My boy.
- You're back? - Yes, come on.
Floor.
As.
Hey, Moussa!
Wait for us, we're coming.
Here we come!
What do you have?
Let's go.
Drink.
Stop!
Police, stop!
Don't move!
To the ground.
Come on, come on. Everyone on the ground!
Have you heard?
Stop.
Stop!
Everyone on the ground.
Have you heard?
Stop!
To the ground!
Stay still.
Stop!
After you!
And you? Get up.
Where is the money?
Put yourself there.
Here we are in Libya.
With money you get in, without it there is prison.
Force.
- After you. - You on the ground!
Hey, bring it up.
Come on.
Standing!
Force.
Stand up, you!
Where is the money? Where did you hide them?
I have no money.
- You don't have them? - No.
Where did you put them?
Now let's see.
Come here!
- Where is the money? - No.
Where is the money?
Put him with the others.
Now let's see.
With the others!
Let's see who hid the money up their ass.
Drink!
Come on, drink.
Come on, drink!
Have you heard? You too!
Drink!
Drink, come on.
Drink it all!
Drink!
Drink too.
So let's see.
Drink.
Drink!
- Drink. - Drink!
Drink!
There's nothing here.
Or.
- Not here either. - Go.
- Nothing. - Go.
- Nothing here. - Go away!
Go away!
Look.
Did you want to fool us?
Now you come with me to prison.
You come!
-Moussa. -Seydou!
Get in the car.
- Force. - Take me too.
- I don't want to be alone. - Enough!
- Let's go! - Moussa!
Let's go away.
-Moussa! -Seydou!
Moussa!
Moussa!
Come on, get in.
Come on.
- Nationality? - Cameroon.
Group number two, go.
- Nationality? - Congo.
Group number three. Go!
- Where are you from? - Senegal.
Senegal, group three.
Fast!
- Where are you from? - Cameroon.
Cameroon, group two. Go!
- You? - Cameroon.
Cameroon, group two. Fast!
Where are you from?
Sit here.
Where are you from?
Senegal, group three.
Come on, quick!
Fast! Where are you from?
- Ivory Coast. - Get over here.
- Where are you from? - Evils.
Put yourself there.
Ivory Coast, stand here.
Where are you from? Senegal?
Here.
I am your intermediary.
I'll take care of you.
I'm here to help you.
- Do you know where you are? - No.
You are in a prison.
The people you see there
they are not policemen, nor gendarmes nor soldiers.
They are very dangerous.
They are the Libyan mafia.
Do whatever they say to do.
Otherwise, if you don't,
they will mistreat you, torture you and may kill you.
Therefore, what you need to do is call your relatives in your town.
To send you money.
It's $800. It's not much, it's for your life.
It's not expensive, it's for your life.
Call them.
So let's resolve the situation and then you will be free.
So, what I tell you now
is that I will give you time
to think about it.
I want to give you time to think about it.
When you have thought about it, you will find a solution.
Hurry up!
Come.
Have you understood where you are?
In the torture room.
And they refused to give out the phone number.
One thing is certain,
if you don't give your number, you will be tortured like them.
If they don't give me their number, I'll kill them.
Did you understand what he said? Whoever doesn't give his phone number is dead.
Look at the corpses there.
Your brothers, crowded together, because they didn't give their number.
But give me your number!
Before being tortured.
You will still be tortured, so give it to me.
Whoever has the number, give it to me.
You got it?
Here you are. Do you see?
Do like him.
Who else?
Good, that's how it's done.
View?
Good boy! You come.
- Nabil. - Yes.
They give me the number.
- Yes, it's these three. - Come on, go.
Oh!
Who gives me the number?
Who gives it to me?
Do like your brothers.
Guys, save yourselves all this. Give the number to call home.
I'll call.
Won't you give me your number?
Can anyone give me their number?
So, I'm sorry.
- Nabil? - Don't move.
- The number? - They won't give it to me.
Come on, come on. Move!
Come on, come on.
- This also. - Fast. Move!
Quick, come on.
- Go! - You too.
Fast!
Seydou.
Seydou.
You are here?
You called me?
I'm afraid I'll never see my mother again.
I would like to see you again to tell you I'm sorry
for leaving secretly.
I wish I could tell you I'm still alive.
I'm not dead.
Tell her I miss her so much.
I really miss it.
I miss him so much.
I would also like him to forgive me.
An angel?
An angel?
You come.
I'll give you a message to take to Seydou's mother.
When you are with her,
tell her that Seydou is alive.
He is fine and asks her for forgiveness.
Also tell her that he misses her a lot.
Tell him.
Do not forget.
He will tell her for sure.
Can I go with him though?
You can not.
Please, I want to see her again.
Okay, you're allowed.
But keep in mind that you will be able to see her, but she won't.
Seydou is alive.
He is alive and well.
He misses you very, very much.
He asks for your forgiveness
for leaving without saying anything.
Mom.
Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
- Mom? - Calm.
Mom!
- Mom! - Stay calm.
Give me some water.
Courage.
It will all be fine.
Can you hear me? Make room for him so he can lie down.
After you.
Come on, wake up!
I need people.
I need some carpenters.
Who is a carpenter?
- Are you sure? Otherwise you will die. - Yes.
Out!
On your feet, fast.
Quick!
Come on, we don't have time to waste.
I need builders.
Bricklayers!
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Out.
Come on, hurry up!
Nobody else?
Let's go.
Welcome.
Quick, come on.
- How much for this? - 600 dinars.
Quick, let's not waste time.
Take it.
- Good morning. - Good morning.
Are you interested in this?
How much for this?
Six hundred dinars, that's pretty strong.
Ok I take it.
- Come forward. - Come on, come on.
We work together.
I'll give you a discount for both.
Go, come on.
- Five hundred each. - Okay, as you say.
Well.
So, that's the villa.
You have to build a very solid wall around it.
Agree?
You sleep there.
There is something to eat
and afterwards, to work.
This is my family.
- This is you? - Yes I am.
And this is my daughter, the eldest.
- Okay. -She is 19 years old.
This is the second one, she is 18 years old.
And this is my son, he's 16 years old.
And the one next to them is their mother.
- She is beautiful. - Thank you.
And how old are you?
I'm 16.
- Like my son. - Yes.
When you left, did your father know?
My dad died.
Peace to his soul.
And your mother?
No, my cousin and I left without telling her anything.
And where is your cousin?
They took him when we were in the desert.
But I'm sure we'll meet again.
Certain.
Good job!
The master is happy with you.
Yes.
There's another thing.
The owner wants a fountain like this.
Could you build it?
I have to see.
Yes, I can do it.
- Like the one in the photo? - Even better.
Are you sure?
Yes.
If you make it like the one in the photo and the owner will like it,
the owner will set you free and pay for your trip to Tripoli.
Agree?
Come on, get to work.
I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
In my opinion, it's even better than the photo he gave us.
But you will judge for yourself.
Come.
So you can see how it works.
Agree.
See?
We built it in an octagonal shape.
The majolica tiles are splendid.
The fountain dish comes from abroad.
Want to see how it works?
Good morning, have you seen a Senegalese named Moussa?
- No. - Maybe they know, try there.
Thank you.
- Good morning. - Good morning.
Have you seen a Senegalese named Moussa?
No, I do not know him.
- A Senegalese? - Yes, his name is Moussa.
No.
- Try looking for it there. - Yes, there.
Seydou, come.
Yes?
He is Senegalese.
- Nice to meet you, how's it going? - Hi I'm fine.
- Have you seen a Senegalese named Moussa? - Moussa?
No, I do not know him.
But try over there, there is a community of Senegalese.
- Where? - Do you see the house behind the tree?
- That? - Ask them, maybe it's there.
Ok, let's ask that community.
- Let's go come on. Thank you. - Not at all.
No, wait.
I have to leave.
I can't stay with you.
- Are you leaving already? - Yes, unfortunately I have to leave.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
No, I can not.
I can't leave my cousin here.
We have come this far and we must finish the journey together.
All right. However, if I were to make it,
You know where to find me.
Yes, you can find me in Caserta.
Near Naples, okay?
Come on.
You saved my life.
I thank you for this.
You're really smart.
Don't lose courage.
Never lose it.
And when we see each other again, the two of us will make great fountains.
Insha'Allah.
Thank you.
Go look for it.
Thank you.
Or.
- Issa? - Yes?
Do you happen to know a guy named Moussa?
- Moussa? - Exact.
No, I do not know him.
I am sorry.
Lad?
- Lad? - Yes?
Maybe he arrived, didn't find you and left again.
No, it's impossible.
We left together and I know he would never leave without me.
You say?
Try in other Senegalese communities.
Why are there others?
- Yes. - Of course, there are others.
One is right nearby.
Maybe you'll find it there.
- Another one? -She's not far away, you'll see.
- Back there? - Yes, maybe you'll find it.
Thank you.
Boy, come here.
Yes?
If you can't find it, come back here. I'll give you a place to stay.
But I can't pay you.
It doesn't matter, you'll pay me later.
Thank you very much.
- Moussa? - Yes exactly.
No.
Try where they work iron, there are many Senegalese.
- And where? - Further ahead, straight ahead.
- Straight? Thank you. - Yes. Go, you will find it.
- Salāmu 'alaykum. - Greetings.
Do you know a certain Moussa? He is as tall as me.
I don't know him, but there's a Senegalese over there.
- Ibrahim? - Yes?
Or.
- Salam 'alaykum. - Alaykumu s-islands.
Do you know a Senegalese boy called Moussa?
- Moussa? - Exact.
No, I do not know him.
Do you know how I can find it?
No, there are many Senegalese. But please, be careful on the road.
- I hope you find it. - Thank you.
HI.
Seydou!
Seydou!
The Nigerians who work with me
they told me that a Senegalese arrived.
Maybe he's your cousin.
- Really? - Yes!
- Where? - Downstairs.
Moussa?
Moussa?
It's me, Seydou.
Just me, yes.
I'm Seydou. I'm here.
I was sure I would find you again.
I was very sure.
It's me, Seydou.
It's me.
Do not you recognise me?
I've been looking for you everywhere.
I won't leave you anymore.
Get up, let's go.
What do you have?
What's going on with you?
They shot me.
Did they shoot you?
I was escaping from prison and they shot me in the leg.
But how did they shoot you?
Now let's go to the hospital.
Let's go to the hospital, get up.
Let's go home.
You know they'll never let me into the hospital anyway.
So?
I just want to go back to Senegal.
- But why do you want to go back? - Because they'll cut off my leg.
You'll see that won't happen.
- I want to die in Senegal. - You won't die, I'm here.
I'm here, I won't give up on you.
Europe is close by, we're almost there.
- Moussa, Europe is close. Here we go... - Enough!
You were right when you said it was better not to leave.
- Don't say that, it's not true. - We shouldn't have.
You must be strong. You are a man, overcome difficulties.
Remember when you told me we were going to sign autographs for white people?
Now stop it and let's go.
Come on let's go.
Start?
Do you really want to return to Senegal?
Really?
Hey, do you really want to come back?
After all we went through in the desert?
They did everything to us in that desert.
You couldn't make it across the desert with this leg.
It was you who convinced me.
You convinced me. Memories?
Stop with these stories and let's go. Europe is nearby, we're not far away.
You and me, he thinks.
We will make our dream come true. Can you imagine it?
Come on, get up now.
Let's go away.
- You hurt me. - Sorry, I'm slow.
Hold on, you are strong.
Everything will pass, you'll see.
You come.
When did this happen to you?
Three days ago.
Three days?
Luckily, the bullet came out.
It didn't hit the bone.
Otherwise it would have been more serious.
I know it's very painful.
Can you sleep?
No, I don't sleep.
- Will they cut it? - Do not worry.
Seydou, you need to get him some medicine. Clear?
You have to take disinfectant, antibiotic and painkiller.
So I give him a shot to prevent the infection from progressing.
Do I have to go to the pharmacy to get them?
No, not in the pharmacy.
Go to the market and ask for Samir, the barber.
- Tell him I'll send you. - Yes, Samir.
Samir.
Samir?
Don't touch it, your hands are dirty.
But I wasn't touching her.
So it's perfect.
Here you are. Everything OK?
- Yes, OK.
Seydou, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yes. - Come on, come on.
- I will be right back. - Take care, Moussa.
- Thank you. - Okay?
- Seydou, I checked my leg. - So?
I was careful, I did everything I could.
But you have to get him to the hospital as soon as possible.
They need to get him checked out, get an x-ray
and then operate on it and everything else.
Here I don't have the tools and unfortunately I can't do more than that.
The hospital is the only hope.
But it's useless to go to the hospital because black people don't touch them there.
I know it well, but there is no choice.
This is the only solution, you have to take him to the hospital.
How much time do we have?
No, there's no more time.
Barely ten days.
Otherwise he risks losing his leg.
And believe me, the risk is there.
Even to die.
At this point?
Certainly.
- There he is. - Okay.
Sit down.
What is your name?
- Seydou. - Seydou?
Yes.
They are not enough for one person.
- But I only have these. - And that's all?
Here, come back when you have the rest.
Please.
You have to help me, I only have these and my cousin is seriously injured.
We really have to leave.
- How old are you? - 16.
- Sixteen? - Yes.
Listen, do you think it can work?
Yes.
Listen to me, there is a solution.
If you take care of driving the boat, I'll let you both leave at that price.
- The boat? - Yes.
But I've never driven a boat, I don't even know how to swim.
It's not a problem, I'll teach you how to wear it, it's very easy.
In one day you arrive in Italy.
- One day and we're in Italy? - Yes, just one.
Just always go straight.
And then you're a minor.
If the police come to get you, you risk almost nothing.
- But aren't they sure they'll take me? - No.
If you move away from the booth when you see the police, there is no problem.
- It's easy. - Yes, it's very easy.
I have no time.
If you want to leave it's the only solution, otherwise I'll take someone else.
- I'm in. - Are you there?
Ok.
Cow.
Off we go. Get up!
- Where do we go? - Europe awaits us.
- As? - We're leaving for Italy.
They will treat your leg there.
I'll take you to the hospital.
Then we call the mothers to say we're fine.
Then everything will be fine.
- But where did you get the money? - That's not a problem.
The money wasn't enough, so they asked me to drive the boat.
You understand? They let me drive the boat.
I remind you that you can't even swim.
But what does it have to do with it?
Just keep the rudder straight and you will arrive in Italy.
"My friend."
You are ready? We will do like all Italians:
"Okay, no problem!"
- Yes. - "My goodness!"
- My goodness I like it too much. I say so. - We'll learn the rest.
- Yes? - Come on hurry up. Move!
"Fuck!"
The swear words are yours.
Quick!
- Faster! - Force.
Soon!
- Go! - Move!
- Come on! - Quick!
Come on, fast.
Hurry up!
How many people.
Do I have to carry them all?
Maybe there are other boats.
Sit down!
Sit down, I said.
Sit down.
Walk.
Come on, come on.
- Alright? - Yes.
Come, I'll show you.
This is speed.
Maximum speed here, minimum speed here.
- Ok? - Ok.
This is used to go back and forth. So you go forward, so you go back.
- Is it clear up to this point? - Clear.
This is the compass.
The compass, okay?
When you're out at sea, far away, sometimes the currents make the boat turn.
So you always have to keep heading north.
Always on zero, heading north. All straight.
Zero here is north. All straight.
Did you understand?
Sometimes, when the waves are big… Do you understand what I'm saying?
When the waves are big, catch them from the face, never from the side.
Did you understand? When the waves are big, you have to catch them in front with the boat, like this.
Never on the side of the boat, do you understand?
But do we start with the waves?
No, normally the sea is calm, but you never know.
He's usually calm though, there are no problems. Okay?
- Okay. - Fine OK.
This is a satellite.
If you have a serious problem, you can call this number, like this.
Call this number here.
Yes. Is the boat unsafe?
Yes, the boat is safe, but you never know, you might have engine problems or something,
and in that case, call this number so they can help you. Okay?
- Did you understand or not? - Yes.
Now the most important thing, the engine.
There he is.
What do you have? What happens?
You have to find someone else in my place.
- I can't drive that boat. - Why are you not capable?
I explained it to you, it's very easy. Always straight, no problems.
I taught you how to drive the boat, what's the problem?
I can't take responsibility.
There are a lot of people.
And I'm scared.
- Why are you afraid. - There are too many people, lives.
There are children.
There are women.
I taught you and you accepted.
- Now drive and shut your mouth. - I'm afraid to kill them.
You have to look for someone who has experience, but I…
I have no experience.
I do not care.
Do what I say, I can't waste time with you.
Just drive.
Take it away from me.
You come.
But I'm afraid to kill them.
- Moussa? - Yes?
Don't you think the sea is rising?
As?
Can't you see the waves?
They are taller. If water goes into the engine, it's done.
- No, they seem like before to me. - You see?
They weren't like that, they're getting bigger.
I see them as before.
It is not so.
Moussa?
Look at those lights.
- What lights? - Those.
Look, here we are.
- We have arrived. - However.
We made it.
But are we in Italy?
Of course yes.
"Oh mama!"
You realize? We managed to arrive.
We made it.
It only took us five hours.
- But… - What?
I still can't see the earth.
What do you mean?
Look too! There is no land here.
That must be the port there.
That will be the port and behind it will be the city.
Yes, behind every port there is a city.
Surely the earth is behind.
It's the port, quiet.
I don't see the city or the land, I only see the lights.
How can you tell there's something behind it?
There.
- Moussa? - Yes?
What is that?
I haven't the slightest idea.
It's certainly not Italy.
Move, come on.
Madame, drink some water.
Madame, make an effort.
Come on, come on, madame.
Stay calm.
Keep calm.
You feel better?
Keep calm.
- He's sick. - You will have your baby, I promise.
You won't die.
- My baby. - You won't die, I promise you.
I promise you, I'll call for help.
I'll call for help, okay?
Ok?
There are people on board who are very ill.
And there are children and women.
Okay. Are there any women on board?
Yes, there are women and I can't drive
because there is a woman who is pregnant.
If I keep driving, it will shake.
She is bleeding.
She bleeds and risks losing her baby.
There's a pregnant woman bleeding, is that right?
Yes, he's bleeding.
I understand.
Listen, you already gave me your coordinates and GPS location.
- Yes. - I'll call the coast guard right away.
Thank you.
Listen to me carefully, it's important. It's going to take some time, okay?
- But why? - It will take some time.
It will take some time, but I will call them immediately. Agree?
But please, madame, help us.
- Help us, please. - I'll call them.
I'll give them your location right away.
I'll call them immediately.
Yes, but hurry otherwise she will die.
But I need help.
Yes, I understand.
I'm calling Malta.
I called the Maltese coast guard and no one answers.
I also tried calling the Italian coast guard,
but they told me that you are not in their jurisdiction.
So they told me to keep calling Malta
and I'm doing it.
But we've been waiting for hours. Don't you want to come?
We at Alarm Phone don't have boats, we act as intermediaries.
I'm really sorry.
Please, madame, I'm afraid someone might die.
Yes, I'll call them back now.
- I know you don't want to come, okay? - Okay?
You want us to die here,
in the middle of the sea.
I'll take responsibility, I'll take them all to Italy.
And no one will die, I will get them all safely.
Does it hurt?
Captain, there are people sick in the engine room.
What would it be like in the engine room?
Yes, in the engine room.
But how can this be?
You keep it.
There is no one left.
Calm down, calm down!
Give me some water.
Give me water!
Help me!
Stop, there's a pregnant woman.
Don't push!
Move over.
Calm down, don't push!
Hey, move!
Sit down!
Stop!
Calm down!
Enough, calm down!
Fuck!
Enough!
Enough!
Calm down!
Cow!
But do you understand that if you continue to do this, you risk dying?
You need to calm down! You have to be slow.
Do you want to understand it?
You're fucking men.
Nobody will die. Nobody!
I promise you, no one will die.
Allah is with us, no one will die.
- Allah Akbar! - Allah Akbar!
Allah Akbar!
Allah Akbar!
Allah Akbar!
- Insha'Allah! - Insha'Allah!
Moussa!
Look there, it's the earth.
We have arrived!
Italy!
- Italy! - Italy!
I'm the captain!
I captain.
I captain.
I did it!
I did it!
They are all alive, no one is dead.
Nobody died. Nobody!
I captain!
I'm the captain.
I captain.
I captain!
I did it!
I'm the captain. It's me!
I captain!
I captain.
I.
I'm the captain.
I'm the captain.
