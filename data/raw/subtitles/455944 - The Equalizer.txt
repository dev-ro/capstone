Mr. McCall. Sorry to bother you.
Yeah.
We're looking into a homicide
that occurred two weeks ago.
Five dead. Russian restaurant.
I heard about it on TV.
I happened to be there that night.
Oh, you were?
Yeah.
You wouldn't be here if I wasn't.
Right.
We're just checking to see if anyone
remembered anything suspicious.
Not that I recall.
May I ask why you dined
at that particular restaurant?
I like pirozhki.
There's five Russian restaurants
in walking distance of your apartment.
I assume they all serve pirozhki.
Wow. I was meeting a friend.
It was her idea.
Then I guess I should talk...
Sheila Saunders.
But she can't help. She wasn't there.
Her daughter had a fever.
Didn't stay long?
I didn't check my watch.
I see. Well, thanks
for your cooperation.
Very welcome.
Tell me, do you know this girl?
Yeah, I don't know...
I don't remember where from.
What happened?
She fell down and broke her neck.
Did she?
I'll be in touch.
Don't you wanna leave me
your card, officer?
In case I remember anything? That's
what policemen usually do, right?
Must have given them all out.
How'd you find me?

I'm not at the Agency anymore.
I consult on a few things. That's it.

You had a nice funeral,

[BOTH CHUCKLE]
You know, when they told Susan
you were dead,
she couldn't comprehend it.
She said, "Oh, no. Not Robert.
And not from something
as trivial as a car bomb."
That you're alive
is a big relief.
But it didn't come
as a complete surprise to her.
We used to talk about you
over the years, and she said
if anyone could have figured
a way out,
a way to walk away from it all
for good, you know,
like a real fresh start...
it would have been...
you.
[HELICOPTER WHIRRING]
[♪♪]
SUSAN:
You didn't take out five pimps, Robert.
You took out the East Coast hub
of Vladimir Pushkin.
ROBERT: Pushkin.
Mm-hm.
An oligarch who jumped in bed
with the Russian mafia,
only he funds everything:
gasoline, weapons, girls, you name it.
He's built an intricate network
on both U.S. coasts
that are incredibly well-insulated.
His money and political ties
make him untouchable.
Your friend here is who Pushkin
sends when he's got a problem.
Teddy Rensen.
Real name, Nicolai ltchenko.
Skill set honed in Spetsnaz.
He's formidable and smart.
Ran a wing of the secret police
for years.
Went private when the Union fell.
Basically, he's a sociopath
with a business card.
ROBERT:
Mm.
Thank you, darling.
You know these two?
Uh...
Boston P.D. Probably on
Pushkin's payroll, I assume.
Three years. Detective Remar
and Detective Pederson.
Only now they're dead.
They found them yesterday in the trunk of
their car in the precinct parking lot.
Suffocated. Testicles blown off
and shoved down their throats.
Classic Russian mob hit.
Teddy's work.
Third one, Detective Masters hasn't
shown up for work in several days.
Robert, I don't have to tell you
what happens next.
He won't stop until he kills you
and anyone you care about.
[♪♪]
SUSAN:
Didn't sleep a wink, did you?
Hey.
Mm.
Robert, that girl,
Alina...
Why?
I couldn't tell you
why it mattered.
Why what they did to her,
that mattered to me so much.
One day somebody
does something unspeakable
to someone else to...
someone you hardly knew,
and you...
do something about it because you can.
Mm.
Because it's who you are? Hm?
Mm.
Who you've always been?
Sometimes we make the wrong choices
to get to the right place.
Mm.

Only one you're gonna get.
When you pray for rain,
you gotta deal with the mud too.
When you look at me...
what do you see?
[CHUCKLES]
Hm?
The answer's nothing.
I have no feelings about you
one way or the other. You're like...
Like lint or a bottle cap.
You're just a thing to remove.
I knew a Russian police captain
back in the day.
He told me about a case he worked on.
Can't remember the guy's name.
He was a famous scholar,
lived in Moscow.
He was a humanitarian,
an author.
Anyway, he decided to share his
abundance with someone less fortunate.
And even though he had five children,
he opened his home to a sixth.
An orphan, 12-year-old boy.
Kid had been pounded
by the system from an early age.
Troubled.
Prone to violence.
A lost cause.
Stop me if you know this one.
Oh, no. Carry on.
Okay. So this good man
opened his home to this boy.
And when the boy stole from him,
this good man loved him anyway.
When the boy failed in school, this man
showed understanding and patience.
When the boy lied and cheated
and clawed and fought,
this good man showed compassion
and love
until the boy, who had never felt
anything like being wanted or loved,
he finally did.
The man had broken through.
It was a miracle.
One week later, intruders broke
into the man's house.
Killed the man and his wife in bed.
They said some small things
were stolen,
things a child might steal.
No one knows for sure.
The man's children
were sent off to relatives.
The boy, the orphan,
shipped back to hell.
Just when he finally had a chance at life,
it was snatched away by two bullets.
It's a well-known story.
Mm. They ever catch who did it?
Did they?
Maybe they didn't look
in the right place.
Sometimes the answer's
in front of you.
[IN RUSSIAN]
I think the boy killed them.
[IN ENGLISH]
I think the boy did it.
The boy was scared his foster parents
would wake up one day
and realize he wasn't worth it,
like all the others had.
And he couldn't bear the thought
that this good man would do that to him.
Would throw him away...
like a piece of lint or a bottle cap.
So...
he decided not to find out.
What do you think, Nicolai?
You think you know me?
[CHUCKLES]
You strike me as
a sentimental man, Mr. McCall.
That's surprising.
l...
I don't possess that chip.
I never could understand what comes
from feeling that way
except weakness.
The men I killed, your men,
I gave them a chance.
They made their decision.
I'm giving you
the opportunity to make yours.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You let me know...
when you decide.
Of course.
I've done some bad things
in my life, Nicolai.
Things I'm not proud of.
I promised someone
that I love very much
that I would never go back
to being that person.
But for you...
I'm gonna make an exception.

I get my stitches out
next week.
Um...
I'm reading now.
Oh, no.
Yeah. I know.
Very good.
I got it from a used book store. The guy
there recommended it to me. It's good.
I got a job too.
A real job with real hours and stuff.
Okay.
[♪♪]
When they gave me
my stuff back at the hospital,
there was this envelope
with my name on it.
Almost $10,000 inside
and a ticket out of town.
Probably hush money, right?
Probably.
Who cares?
A new start.
Alina the singer.
Someone once told me
I could be whoever I wanted to be.
Body, mind...
Spirit.
I'm gonna miss your stories, Robert.
You got your own now.
Thank you.
For everything.
[SIGHS]
I'll catch you around.
Okay.
Bye, Robert.
Goodbye, Alina.
