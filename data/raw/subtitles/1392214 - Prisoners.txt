because you have no idea.

What I'm trying to say is I kind of feel

You wanna come on in?
Yeah.
My husband and I were
very devout at one time.
Spent our summers driving around
in that camper with our son...
...handing out pamphlets.

I keep dreaming about being lost in a maze.

...so when people come over here,
I hardly know what to say.
He doesn't talk much?
Well, he talks. Good morning,
good night, that sort of thing.
Hard to get too much
more than that out of him.
Had an accident when he was little.
After that he started choosing his words
a little too carefully.
- What...? What kind of accident did he...?
- Oh.
My husband kept snakes.
It wasn't that bad what happened,
but Alex had a fear of them and...
That's not my favorite memory.
I'm sorry. It's none of my business.

It's like he's play-acting. Case in point:
Except for the items ID'd
by the Dovers and the Birches...
...all the kids' clothes that we found
still had tags on them.
And that maze book that we found,
he made it.
Photocopies, pictures from this book
we found in the attic.
- Ex-FBI agent wrote that.
- "Finding the Invisible Man."
It's about a theoretical suspect he believed
was responsible for a bunch of abductions.
It's totally discredited,
I guess, but I read some of it.
Taylor was abducted when he was a kid.
He ran away after three weeks.
The captor drugged him on some
sort of LSD/Ketamine cocktail.
He never remembered
and they never caught the guy.
Okay, so, he read the book and decided
he was taken by the Invisible Man.
Now he's doing his best imitation, right?
Yeah, he was doing his best imitation.
He killed himself last night.
How did he do that?
I thought he was in custody.
Hey.
Taylor drew this. It's a map to the bodies.
It's a map to the bodies.
We found the same design
on a pendant we pulled off that corpse.
