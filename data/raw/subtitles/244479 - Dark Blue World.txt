It won't take off, will it?
Don't worry,
not while I'm around.
Now what?
Take hold of the joystick.
-This thing here?
-See how it moves.
This is how we turn left,
and right...
Look at the wings.
This is how we dive.
And this...
what's it doing?
Hey! It's...
This is how we climb, Hanichka.
-Aren't we going too high?
-All the way
to heaven.
Slama,
is that all you've done today?
He's not well, Sir.
Come with me.
Sit down and write:
"Dear Family,
comma,
Do not send me any more food parcels
as I am not doing my job properly."
Sign it!
Sir, let him be.
He has a fever.
Mind your own business, Machaty!
Back to your place!
Back to your place!
Franta...
Back to your places!
During world war II hundreds of Czechoslovak 
Pilots fought with the British against the Nazis.
After the war the Communists seized
power in Czechoslovakia
and jailed the pilots who had
returned home.
They feared these heroes would
once again fight for freedom.
Mirov Prison, Czechoslovakia, 1950
what's your name?
Franta Slama.
Vilda Houf, sign painter.
In here for my appendix.
Look!
Locked up for stealing State property!
Some pots of paint.
why are you here?
Pneumonia.
I mean, why did they lock you up?
I flew for the RAF. In England.
I see!
Let there be no mistake.
This is a forced-labour camp.
You are educated men
so you know what it means.
Our "amnesty" cart.
It has only one route
to the cemetery and back.
The only amnesty
you're ever going to know...
Lie on your side.
Better than on your back.
-Did you see that?
-what?
-The tattoo on his arm.
-He's an SS man.
You're kidding!
They're in the kitchen too.
You're in here with SS men?
So are you.
But I didn't fight against them.
There you go.
I did.
Olomouc Airfield,
Czechoslovakia, 1939
You know how you fly,
Voytishek?
-A bit wild?
-No.
-Too much throttle?
-No.
I give up.
Like a natural.
Really?
where's my dog?
Anyone seen my dog?
She ran to the hangar.
Of course, Gregora's stuffing her
with salami again.
Give me the hangar.
Line your pants gents.
Tomorrow you're flying solo.
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,851
-Hangar,
-You got my dog there?
- Yes, Sir,
-Put her on the phone.
What? On the phone?
That's what I said.
Take a look, gentlemen.
Barcha, come here!
She's on the line.
Barcha! Where
did I tell you to wait?
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,729
That's all,
gentlemen.
Dismissed.
The show's over.
Barcha... Good girl...
Ssh.
My Papa!
Barcha. Her Papa!
Silence! Adolf Hitler speaks,
You're the one
we've been waiting for, bastard!
Not you!
Quiet!
-You know what my mother said?
-what?
I'll end up marrying Kanka.
That lollipop-man down there?
-He'll be completely bald soon.
-But he's set his sights on me.
And you think I haven't?
Quiet! My parents!
-Think they don't know?
-Know what?
-That we're in love.
-Of course they know,
but not that
I let you love me so... deeply!
what's that?
-That's him.
-who?
Kanka, of course.
He serenades me every night
to touch my heart.
Hanichka.
I'm coming, Papa.
Just a minute!
Hanichka, please open the door!
Papa...
-Good evening.
-Captain!!
Mr. Pechar, let me explain...
They're repeating it over and over.
At six a.m. on March fifteenth
the Armed Forces of the German Reich
will begin occupying our country,
Any resistance will be met
with brutal retaliation,
I'm sorry.
Cry all you want. who wouldn't?
All units will be disarmed,
No aircraft, military or civilian,
are to leave their bases,
Turn it off!
Cut the engine!
I'm taking it to Poland.
we can't let them have it!
Pilot Officer,
switch off your engine now!
Didn't you hear the order?
Yes, but I didn't like it.
Nobody's asked your opinion.
Get out!
why did you think the others
aren't taking off?
Because it's suicide
in this weather!
You'll crash into the first hill!
I know.
Everything
is conspiring against us.
England, France, the weather,
even my back,
everything.
we should tell our men
the Poles will need pilots,
ground crews too,
because Poland is next in line.
Nothing official.
Volunteers.
Preferably,
single men.
They're here.
Slama, please take over.
I can't move.
Let's call it an order.
Yes Sir.
Good morning gentlemen.
Ober-Lieutenant Hesse!
It's my duty
to take over this airfield.
Our commanding officer,
wing-Commander Skokan
is physically indisposed.
I'm in charge.
Lieutenant Slama.
This whole army seems
"physically indisposed".
what a lovely map!
So, yesterday we were here.
we had a good look
at your famous defences.
Abandoned without a shot?
As a soldier, I can't understand it.
Sir, kindly do your duty
and respect the honor of soldiers
who have been forced to do theirs.
Keep your shirt on.
Just a little joke.
Now, I'd like to see the planes.
Gentlemen!
The keys, please.
All right boys, let's go.
I can imagine how you must feel.
A German officer would put
a bullet in his head.
But you are...
a little different,
aren't you?
Pilot Officer Voytishek!
I've got a spare seat.
Thank you,
but I'll stick with the boys.
You're taking it too personally.
How else! I felt like throwing up
in the hangar.
we carried out an order.
Now we can go home,
take off our uniforms,
and take it personally.
How long will it take you to pack?
Me?
No time at all.
Don't forget to brush out her ears.
Thistles get stuck in there.
She'll be grateful.
And in winter ice forms
on these hairs between her pads.
They hurt her,
so you have to cut them out.
But I'll be back well before then.
She'll listen to me?
Of course.
She knows you're a part of me.
what's this?
In case you come back at night
and the house is locked.
Thank you.
You don't have any documents on
you? In case we're searched?
No, Mr Slama.
Good.
And call me Franta.
And you can call me Karel.
I know.
I don't know how to put it...
Sir, I mean Franta...
but I do have some documents
I'd like to take with me.
what are they?
No, forget it, I'll get rid of them.
You'd only laugh at me.
No, I won't. Promise.
Let's see them.
Horses?
That's only camouflage.
There's worse.
She's my only girl.
I'd rather not part with her.
Your only girl?
-Then you should keep her.
-Thanks.
Sir,
I mean Franta! Look!
Oh God!
Barcha, you mustn't do this.
Go home.
Go home!
Back to Hanichka.
Go home!
Go or I'll hit you!
what's she doing?
She keeps turning around
but she is going back.
England, 1940
I can't see shit.
Shut up!
we're pedaling like maniacs.
This is stupid. I'm knackered!
-Behind you!
-Break left!
You bastards.
why don't you let us fly!
-what's he saying?
-Get up. we're doing it again.
No! To hell with this!
It's not what I came here for!
On your bikes!
Out of my way.
what'd he say?
He says you're Myrtvy.
Thanks.
May I keep her?
One week.
It means le...lend, stupid.
Shut it!
Open your mouth wider!
No language! Just madness.
Stop fooling about, Karel.
Ladies!
Excuse me,
a fortnight without
just isn't healthy.
A little well
in an open field,
I'm trying to do your mouth,
so shut it!
why donÂ’t we go
to the beach sometime.
-I've never swum in the sea.
-It's freezing.
Just to dip our toes.
Hey. Look!
what do you think he's saying?
He's trying to land them.
-I'd just get a slap in the face.
-You mustn't frighten them.
Machaty begins by asking the way.
Say, to the Officers' Mess.
But doesn't he know
where it is?
It's a device.
women like to help you
when you're in trouble when...
they don't feel threatened.
It's how you break the ice.
Did Machaty tell you that?
It's common knowledge.
Great!
I guess English
is important after all.
There's no resemblance.
You just shut up Deadman.
with your name
you don't belong in a plane
but a coffin.
This supposed to be me?
Yes, I'd like you to have it.
Grinning like an idiot for this!
It's only good to scare kids!
what did he say?
Monkey catching.
Us? Makes sense. we've done
just about everything else.
Lift up your shirt.
were you in France,
when we invaded?
-Yes.
-And what did you think?
-How you moved! Breathtaking.
-Don't breathe.
Blitzkrieg.
A short and sweet war.
Take a deep breath.
It was hard to be a German
and not be proud.
You can breathe now.
The English returned
from their missions
with empty magazines,
and all we could do was
circle the airfield, target-shooting,
Three months later...
Lend me another to do the tits.
This one?
No, I need her.
A little well, made of stone,
in an open field stands alone,
And its water is,
That's us you idiots!
Finally!
Show yourselves, bastards!
There they are! Two o'clock low!
Oh shit!
Boys, don't jump the gun,
Fire only when they're
squarely in your sights,
Shit!
Boys! Messerschmitts!
A whole swarm of them!
Tom Tom, on your tail!
I can see him,
But he's glued to my arse.
Boys, you noticed,
I don't stutter when I'm shit-scared?
Tom Tom can't bail out!
-N2, Roger.
-N3, Roger,
Move yourself, bastard!
N2! Dive to sea level!
I can't hear you.
Dive to sea level,
Too little fuel to follow you!
what?
Bedrich, we're not fighting
anymore, it's beddy-byes now.
The Germans are also beddy-byes,
they've stopped firing.
Even Hitler is beddy-byes
with Eva Braun.
Lying on your heart is no good,
it can give you nightmares.
Look at Sysel,
sleeping nicely on his back.
Good old Moravian pig...
-we have different things in mind.
-what do you mean?
I want... you know what...
and she just wants to teach me
English.
She says after the war... for the
other.
The one next to her doesn't look
as if she'd need to wait for peace.
She's more than I could handle.
-And her?
-She's Machaty's.
She's your date?
You said it!
It's amazing...
how calm they are.
And that'll be Hitler's downfall.
Because he's a hot-head
like our Voytishek.
Me a hot-head?
Just you wait!
You know what's crossed my mind?
What?
Maybe I'm not handling her right,
We go for long walks,
She doesn't stop talking,
Of course we kiss but,
Do you think she expects me
to pounce on her?
I wouldn't know,
but shut up for now, okay?
But think about it, will you?
Sure,
-Franta!
-what?
I see him,
One o'clock,
Hugging the ground,
He's yours, Karel,
I'm going in,
Franta, I'm hit!
Can you hear me?
Karel!
Oh God!
Out of the way!
I'll start her up.
Are you alright?
-In hospital?
-Stitched up his stomach.
who's that?
Sysel. He was holding his guts.
It was oozing blood.
He'll be there for a week at least.
You land on your head
when you bailed out yesterday?
Not on my head,
on a woman!
And I fell madly in love with her.
I'm crazy about her.
Really?
I'm going mad.
One could...
One could escape from here.
I'd like to know how.
You see that barbed wire over
there?
If one got hold of a pair of pliers...
The wall's only five meters.
Gentlemen.
It's my birthday today.
-Fifty.
-Your health, doctor!
My father died at fifty.
Also a doctor.
In Reichenberg.
You know how many people
came to his funeral?
A hundred and twenty-seven.
My sister counted them all.
They loved him so.
That's life...
How many people did you kill
in the war, Mr. Slama?
No idea.
Take a guess.
Maybe ten.
Me, not one.
Have you ever seen an execution?
I did.
In Prague. At Kobylisy.
I had to check that
the people were dead.
For a whole month.
Day in day out.
-How do I look?
-Ravishing.
Really?
You're pulling my leg?
Get out, you Romeo.
wait here. I'll give you a sign.
Lovely, isn't she?
I prefer bigger tits, but she is pretty.
How do you say "vinegar" in
English?
-well, what do you think?
-Beautiful, Karel.
Really beautiful.
Not asleep, Honza?
Jura Sysel died,
so I'm scoring his favorite tune
for the English
to play at his funeral.
There are so many parts,
the clarinet,
all the brass...
it takes some doing to sound right.
Keep at it...
Know what I'm sad about?
No. what?
I really liked Sysel,
but I never told him.
Men don't talk about such things
but I'm sure he knew.
He couldn't have,
because I didn't know myself.
He got on my nerves.
His Moravian yodeling
really pissed me off.
It's only now I know I liked him.
Let's get some sleep.
In war men should tell
each other how they feel.
Nothing wrong with him.
Just his face smashed up.
we'll get him in the morning.
Honza?
who messed you up like this?
Kolichek.
He hit me...
I hit the stove.
Herr Commandant has a hard stove.
He's a snake.
Check my fingers.
God I hope my fingers are all right.
They're okay.
You'll play again.
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:26,015
They are all the same.
The same blows. Nazi interrogations,
Communist interrogations,
no difference.
-Also a pilot?
-It's Machaty, the pianist.
So tell me Herr Slama
why are you all locked up in here?
I understand why I'm here.
we lost the war
and must be punished.
But you? I don't understand.
what did you do to them?
Nothing.
Nothing?
-But what were you tried for?
-There was no trial.
well, well, Machaty.
Back in England I bet you never
dreamt
they'd welcome you home
with such a sad song.
You said it.
Had you known,
you wouldn't have fought us so?
That's where you're wrong.
Did she say anything about me?
She said you were sweet.
Sweet, sweet...
-Something she didn't like about me?
-No, nothing.
You can't drive in this fog.
who'd I bump into?
No one drives in such fog.
Some other love-sick idiot like you?
I have to see her.
Listen to me.
Maybe she's worried that I'm...
too young?
Did she say I was sweet once or
twice?
Six times, you fool.
Go on then.
But be careful.
Can you believe it?
She wasn't home.
A strange woman was there.
-where did you sleep?
-In the car.
She went to see her brother in
London.
why do I have to get the shits
before each flight?
Better before than during.
Blue four.
My engine is playing up.
Permission to return to base, Franta?
What's the problem?
It's misfiring, losing power.
Permission granted,
You might call them small tits,
but you should see them!
Messerschmitts!
Franta, watch out!
Get among them
so they can't aim! Tally ho!
Karel, get him!
Well done, Karel,
Go lower, Machaty,
Take the one in the back,
Machaty, watch your back side!
When Goliath spits in his eye,
David swings his sling,
One was big and one had courage,
Goliaaath!
My first!
It's my first!
There's something I've got to tell
you.
No, Franta.
-It's important.
-I need to talk to you.
-Karel, listen.
-No, listen to me!
You listen to me!
It's so nice to be in love.
She may not want me,
but I'm still happy.
Maybe a little unhappy too,
but still happy.
Are you asleep?
Look, Karel...
Remember when you went to see her
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,495
in that terrible fog?
Susan...
came here to see me.
I told her we were best friends,
and sent her away.
I was afraid to tell you then.
But you should know,
even if it hurts.
I've a really bad toothache.
-You're not going up today?
-I must see the dentist.
Know what the mechanics call you?
Boomerang.
Takes off and comes right back.
when your engine's...
There's nothing wrong with your
engine. They checked it.
I can't help it.
I get diarrhea before each flight
and throw up when we land.
I only eat what comes up easily.
Porridge, custard...
You could apply for a transfer
to the ground crew.
No one would blame you.
-You mean not fly anymore!
-I'd be the first to regret it.
I feel safer having you behind me.
I'll see the dentist tomorrow.
And all the way, I kept asking
myself, why was l going there?
The only answer was that
I wanted her to write Karel
a kinder letter,
To give him some hope,
Yes, that was it,
But I forgot it was Sunday,
Visiting day for the parents
of Susan's evacuees,
where were you?
In London. At the Embassy.
Get into a fight there?
No. why?
Your button's missing.
Really?
I'll ask Pierce to see to it tomorrow.
That's my locker.
I am sorry Karel.
I'm really sorry.
So Goering has three balls?
No! Two, but small.
So, Hitler has one,
Goering two...
-But small.
-So who has none?
You, Mrtvy, you have none!
Franta, that's us!
Let's go, old man.
Achtung, die Spitfiren!
Come back, It was only me!
You arsehole.
See the train?
Shall we give the driver a chance?
And the stoker,
Okay, let's go.
You take out the engine,
I'll go for the tanker wagons,
Watch out for that atack gun!
Karel!
Can you hear me?
Can't see,
belly landing,
Shit!
You wait here!
we'll check on the peasants.
where is the pilot?
Do you understand?
where is the English dog?
Plane kaput.
Dog out.
Plane boom...
and dog run...
there...
Let's go!
Jeannette!
Get up! It's over! They've gone!
Get up!
It's over, they've gone!
Get in! Climb in!
Don't be a fool, Franta,
there's no room!
Shut up and get in!
Hang on! You're sitting on my arm!
Can you reach the throttle?
I can't.
How's the fuel?
wouldn't know?
I can't see the gauge.
Neither can l!
Stop fidgeting,
I think you've dislocated my
shoulder!
You're crazy!
Stop moving around!
what's your code name?
And the emergency frequency?
Next time, on the back.
That'll smudge when you sweat.
-Good luck.
-Thanks.
Be careful!
-So, the dentist?
-worse than war.
-The man's a maniac.
-why?
Just pulls teeth out,
-good or bad!
-Pleased to hear it.
-what?
-That you don't have toothache anymore.
I see.
You're going to fly in pairs.
You'll look after the new chap.
-Me?
-Yes, you.
Take care!
Not only is it dark
around me,
but I cannot see,
I know there is darkness all around
but I cannot see it,
That's beautiful.
My God that's beautiful.
It is,
but I can't play it forever.
Oh yes, you can.
It's the only one I want to hear.
will you teach me to play it?
All right.
I wanted a piano.
But...
My Dad said he'd buy me
an accordion instead...
said it also had keys.
It's true, a piano doesn't
really belong on a farm.
You start playing
and you get the cows mooing along.
You'll teach it to me?
I will.
-But now it's time for bed.
-Not yet. Once more.
One last time.
Okay, one last time.
You haven't finished your drink yet.
So,
tell me,
where 's my perfect vision gone?
The dense blue cloud now covers
all,
the impenetrable dark blue world,
what are you celebrating, you night
owls?
Don't I get a drink?
Tell him.
He's not going to fly with you
anymore.
You bastard!
I'll kill you.
I was always so afraid I'd lose you.
But this is worse
than if you had died on me.
Forgive me, Karel, if you can.
I didn't want this.
Bedrich, bail out!
You're on fire!
Bedrich 's still inside,
what are you doing!
Karel?
-Karel landed?
-Yes, but Bedrich's missing.
-where is he?
-I don't know.
what got into you? I'll kill you!
Think I don't know?
Firing at me from behind!
Son of a bitch!
Fired at me full on!
Over a woman!
Can you believe it?
A German soldier could not do this.
To his own comrade.
I've lost a lot of respect
for you, Herr Ober Lieutenant.
Very much.
Have you never met a woman
who made you lose your senses?
No woman could do that to me.
-Then I'm sorry for you.
-I'm sorry for you.
For you comradeship
is nothing but a bubble.
You blow at it, and it's gone.
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:17,814
we mightn't like each other
but we're all in the same boat.
I've searched my instruments
and can't find the pliers.
There's only the three of us.
If they find them on someone,
know who'll get it? Me.
Shall I report it
and have them turn the place over?
I can't do it. But...
Look out!
Commandant, Sir. Three patients
and one doctor present!
"X-ray essential..."
So what is this I hear Blaschke?
what X-ray?
I reported that Machaty
sustained a head injury.
I was worried about a brain
haemorrhage.
You know how he did it?
Yes.
He fell against the stove.
And that's precisely
what you'll write in your report.
Sir, permission to speak?
Speak, if you must.
As Machaty's former superior officer
I urge you to permit an X-ray.
Son of a bitch,
back at work on Monday.
Sharp!
"Flying Officer Mrtvy is probably
dead?" You can't say that!
He's "missing in action"
and "presumed dead."
That's better.
Perhaps "good" instead of "brave".
-why?
-well, they say he was scared.
Maybe. But he flew all the same.
That's why he was brave.
I'd like to talk to you, Karel.
There's something I want to say to
you.
Your superior officer is addressing
you. Behave accordingly!
I want to apologize to you,
in front of all present,
for accusing you of firing at me.
I was bloody stupid.
You saved my life
when you shot down
that Messerschmitt and I'm grateful.
I respect you
and regret any pain I've caused you.
I'd be glad
if you could forgive me.
And stop drinking
and staying up all night.
You fly exhausted
and senselessly risk your life.
Do you accept my apology?
Let it go, Karel.
Shake hands, you clowns.
"To, Captain Otakar Mrtvy
of Squadron,
Dear Captain,
We regret to inform you
that your brother, Bedrich Mrtvy,
is missing in action and presumed dead."
"It happened on 23rd September
during combat with the enemy,
He was a brave pilot,
He will remain in our hearts forever."
A little well, made of stone
in an open field
stands alone,
Keep moving. Keep moving.
And then we began
to escort the Americans,
Karel moved quarters,
His only words to me in 3 months
were "Yes Sir" on the radio,
I wrote begging him to forgive me,
But a wounded soul heals
slower than a wounded body,
-What's wrong, Franta?
-My engine's conking out.
I'm about to take a swim,
See you, boys.
Red Two, stay with him
and report your position,
Karel is with him, Sir,
Roger,
Is anyone listening!
Take a fix on my signal, you idiots!
Shit!
Go home, Karel.
You'll run out of juice.
what are you doing,
you fool!
My instruments are in such a mess!
Thank you, gentlemen.
My idea of getting out of here...
They put me up to it.
They wanted to pin something on
you so they could beat you up.
what was in it for you?
I'd get out earlier.
The best thing about all this is,
you're not such a bastard.
Barcha? Don't you know me?
Come here...
Hello.
Franta?
They said that...
that you were dead.
So you see,
I'm not.
Don't cry.
No one's to blame.
You are beautiful.
Let's go, Barcha.
Thanks for looking after her.
Barcha!
She's our dog!
Really?
Barcha, come here!
Barcha, come home.
Stay then, Barcha.
Don't be sad, Franta,
Karel, is that you?
Sure,
Where are you?
Behind you, Where I've always been,
2430 Czechoslovakians served in the Royal 
British Air force during the Second world war.
