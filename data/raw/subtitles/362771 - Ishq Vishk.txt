"What happens
 when a boy..."
"meets a girl
 for the first time?"
Love? Or romance?
"What happens
 when a girl..."
"meets a boy
 for the first time?"
Love? Or Romance?
Goodness! Killed me!
He killed me!
Yes?
 What's the matter?
Kamlabai! Haven't I told you not to
 swab this room in the morning?
Go... clean Priya's room.
 - Yes madam
Well! Women these days
 have really lost their minds
Priya!
 Aren't you going to college?
There was this representative who had
 come wearing such a skimpy dress
"Goodness! For almost half-hour,
 none of the guys worked"
"Really?
 - Yes. I tell you, the fault..."
lies entirely with the parents. Why
 give their kids so much of liberty?
Earlier it was not so. I remember
 my Ma wearing such lovely dresses
Wherever she went they used to ask...
 Shameless! Is this any dress?
"You mean this dress? It's fine.
 - Fine, really? Wrong. It's filthy!"
And you've lost your mind!
 - You are over-reacting
"It looks odd at home,
 but it's fashion in college"
"Right, Papa. Short dresses
 are in vogue"
I see. Even Payal goes to college.
 - To each his own likes and dislikes
I don't want guys to call me a nun.
 - I care a damn. I'm off
Where to?
 - Drop me at the college
"I'm already late. Well, call
 your brother too. I'll drop him also"
He isn't ready yet.
 He's still hogging the bathroom
"Baby, make him see reason. The
 vacations are over. It's time to study"
"By the way, what could he be doing
 for so long in the bathroom?"
"Not going to college, Rajiv?
 - Going Ma, going"
"Make it fast, will you?
 - Coming Ma"
I have no one else but you
Packed
"Okay, cute.
 What I can't figure is..."
why doesn't God give girls
 good taste with good looks?
Otherwise is it possible for a guy
 like me to still remain a stag?
"What do Javed and Danny, the studs
 of Spencer College, have that I don't?"
No more am I going to be a stag
 nor will my best friend Mambo
Should be Mambo
"Yes, it is Rajiv's house"
Is Rajiv in?
 - Yes. Come on in
My goodness!
"If he's asleep, let him be.
 - No sir, he's up"
"Fine, I'll sit here"
It's soiled over here
Goodness
Well... what's your name?
 - Kamla
"Kamla, my blossom,
 when do I strike?"
"Kamla, clean my room, please.
 - Right, sir"
Come on. Do you want to be late
 on the very first day of college?
Late? I'm laminated!
 - Dammit
You never told me!
 - About?
"The item.
 - Item...? She's a maidservant, buddy"
"Go on, Mambo.
 - Isn't a maidservant human?"
"Hey social worker,
 at least think of the status!"
"Damn the status!
 Once a sucker, always a sucker"
"Kamla, I'm crazy about you"
Yes?
 - During holidays...
I set the field for a babe
Who is it? Where? How? In detail.
 - Shall I?
Tell me.
 - Shall I?
"Out with it, pronto.
 - It's Dolly"
Dolly Jagtiani? Damn!
 - What's wrong?
"I was angling her. Dolly gone!
 All right, if not Dolly..."
"Polly! Polly Pereira,
 we're made for each other"
"Hi Virgins, is something happening?
 Or is the same old handling-the-snake?"
"Danny, those days are over.
 Because Rajiv has a girlfriend now"
What are you saying?
 - Everything is set
The iron is hot...
 he just got to strike
Really? What's the hot iron called?
What are you talking?
A century in debut
"Give us a few tips, please.
 - Try Taurani. I don't have time"
And Saloni
"Saloni, try me"
"Busted! Which means,
 she took you for a ride"
"Rajiv, weren't you talking
 about your new girlfriend?"
Miss Touch-me-not!
 - She loves to make brothers
How are you?
"Hi nun.
 - Dolly, they addressed you"
Bore! Let's get out of here
"Something's burning, isn't it Danny?"
You ruined it.
 - Quiet
Vacation was boring. I missed college.
 - Missed college? Or...?
I had real fun
"Rajiv, how's everyone at home?
 - Yes Rajiv, how's everyone at home?"
"Everybody is fine at my place too.
 Mom, Dad, dogs and cats... all fine"
"She's so cute, no?
 - Can't help it. She belongs to Javed"
"Not Dolly, I'm talking about Payal.
 - Are you crazy?"
Didn't you hear what they called her?
 A nun
"Shut up. She's in love with you,
 that too since school days"
A girlfriend ought to be like Dolly
 or Saloni. Guys should envy
What?
 - Envy
"Pereira, we're made for each other"
Shall I...?
 - Go on
Go on
What happened?
 - Not my cup of tea... impossible
Don't involve me with Payal
"They are two, so are we. We can
 make great couples. Let's go and chat"
They are too thin.
 - You're too choosy
A beggar ought to make do
 with whatever is given to him
"What will you have?
 - One burger, one hot-dog and chips"
"One burger, one hot-dog,
 chips and one Coke. Quick"
I just can't figure Rocky out
I haven't got to know
 which year student he is
We are his students.
 He changes girlfriends...
like the movies change every Friday.
 Look at him getting cozy
How dare you call me up?
I won't call up again
"Get that, Mambo? One more breakup.
 - Another girl is dumped"
"If you call me up again,
 I'll lodge a police complaint"
Never again! Don't shout.
 My reputation...
We did have a nice time
"You are too good, Rocky.
 You are a love Guru"
"Don't mind this Rocky,
 but the babe went fuming"
"The typical sticky type.
 Easy to woo, hard to dump"
If you don't mind
 may I ask you something?
"One moment, sonny.
 - How come you woo so many girls?"
Is there a fixed formula?
 - No fixed formula
Treat each girl the way she is
Give him 2 bucks.
 - Sure
"You wanted information about
 Pallavi Pradhan, didn't you? Listen"
"Apart from college, between 8 to 10
 on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays..."
she attends classes in Juhu.
 She takes the no. 32 bus at 7:15
But that boyfriend of hers...
 - They split
Stay away from her father. He's wild.
 I didn't need that though
"We're friends, after all.
 Being a G. S pays"
G. S...?
 - General Secretary
No! G. S means
 Girls Samachari (Informer)
"Mr. Love Guru,
 give us tips to woo girls?"
"Have some...
 - Massage! No thanks, I hog all day"
"Love Guru, your love strategy bombed"
The game of love for me is over
"Ass! Go, get an answer from her"
You don't have to do much.
 Just buy her a rose
Fall in love
Don't fear love
Live it up
Give away your heart to someone
"Love Guru, you said I'd make it"
"Believe me, I was thrashed real hard"
This Love Guru is a fake
He's a rotten potato
"He's going to ruin you.
 - He's going to have you beaten up"
"He's going to have you rusticated.
 - He will have you tonsured"
"He'll have your limbs broken.
 - He'll land you in trouble"
Fall in love
Don't fear love
Learn to steal a heart
Fall in love
"What's got into Mambo?
 Mambo, careful"
He's made it!
"Coffee, tea or me?
 Impossible"
"Wham-bham, thank-you-ma'am
 ...impossible"
One night stand... impossible
So what's possible?
"Candlelight dinner... done.
 - Lovely-Lovely music... done"
"Long-Long drive... done.
 - Sweet-sweet talk... done"
Fall in love
Don't fear love
Learn to steal hearts
Fall in love
"Dance in discos... a must.
 - If you give us some chances"
"Coke, popcorn and wafers... must.
 - In an empty theatre that is"
"Rides in motorbikes... must.
 - Apply brakes every now and then"
Always stay alert
You need to flirt a little
"Some love.
 - Everything!"
"Some romance.
 - Give us a chance"
Fall in love
Learn to steal hearts
Fall in love
Live it up
This year I want awards in all three.
 You dig? I don't know how you do it
"Dramatics, painting and dancing...
 I want awards in all three"
What yes? How will you do it?
As usual I kicked up a fuss to have
 you enrolled in the dance competition
Worry not
And what am I enrolled in?
 - In the audience
"If there's no audience,
 who will watch the show?"
Who is Neela?
 - Tonight at 12:30...
they're airing a blue film
Our cable operator Manoj sends such
 messages to special viewers like me
What are you saying? A blue film?
 - It's true
"At 12:30 tonight, switch on to
 the sports channel"
The sports signal goes off
 and the big game begins
What are you doing so late in the night?
 - Watching Mohenjo-Daro
Mohenjo-Daro...? Is it some suspense
 thriller in Sindhi language?
"No Dad, it's on the
 Discovery Channel, Mohenjo-Daro..."
I see. Mohenjo-Daro and Harrappa
 civilizations. My favorite subject
"Why are you sitting, Dad?
 - Must be a half-hour show"
"I can't stand and watch, can I?
 Not yet on air?"
No
Yes Dad?
 - It's time...
for me to tell you about kids
"You might think I'm a kid,
 but I'm grown up, Dad"
When I say kids what I mean is...
 - Goddamn! Is he going...
to lecture me on some nonsense?
 - Suppose there's a boy
and a girl...
 - Yes Dad
"When they come together,
 what happens?"
That thought haunts me day and night
"Wedding, Dad?
 - No, before that. No..."
what happens immediately after wedding?
 - The big game!
"If everything goes fine it's happiness
 all the way. Else, it's tragedy"
"No, you went too far.
 A little before that"
"It's our honeymoon...
 let me take your veil off"
"Roaming around having fun.
 - Honeymoon, right?"
Right.
 - So what happens in honeymoon?
Big game!
Mambo's uncle owns
 a honeymoon resort in Khandala
"Rajiv, you're too naive, son"
"If you need my help anytime,
 don't hesitate to ask me"
Okay Dad
"What time was it supposed to be aired?
 - 12:30, Dad"
I guess they cancelled it.
 I'm feeling sleepy. Good night
"I'll call you if it comes up.
 - No, you watch it. I'm off to sleep"
Mohenjo-Daro! The animals too
 must've been buried by now
I'll tell you. The babe in it
 was so damn sexy... so damn sexy...
"she could put all our actresses
 to shame, I swear"
Get off it. Don't rub salts
"The canteen is full. Find a table,
 while I get some snacks"
Swine
"Reserved?
 - No, sit"
What's up?
 - Writing notes for a friend
Still hooked on social work?
 - Maybe I picked it up writing for you
Where was I?
"What's up? Tuitions, eh?
 - Oh no"
"Obviously, man. Teacher Payal
 is sitting before him with books"
"If not tuition, you think
 it's going to be Fashion TV?"
What's up?
She's studying. Let her be
Something's fishy
Did shopping for the Traditional Day?
 - I bought a lovely dress
Really?
What's come over my heart?
Where am I lost?
"Why do I see the moon
 during daytime?"
"Why do I feel
 it's raining in summer?"
"Why does this feeling arise
 every now and then?"
Is this what they call love?
Now that I have spun a new dream...
this world seems to have changed
Never did I feel like this before
"What passion is it
 that rises in me?"
This moment seems to be intoxicated
And the skies seems to bow
My lips...
"though silent,
 reveal a new tale"
My heartbeats too are upbeat
"Why does this feeling arise
 every now and then?"
In the mirror...
when I saw myself...
"I blushed
 and my gaze lowered"
I skipped...
a heartbeat
For a moment I went breathless
"And now,
 my bangles torment me..."
keep me awake at nights
I'm more restless now
I'm changing bit by bit
"I don't know
 what makes me so anxious"
Is this what they call love?
"Why does this feeling arise
 every now and then?"
Is this what they call love?
Who are they greeting?
 - Not us. Never mind
"My outfit is a perfect air-conditioner.
 Anyway, how is Kamla?"
He's so possessive!
"Where did you pick
 that lovely outfit from, Payal?"
It's Payal! I almost failed
 to recognize you
Right. My word
"Payal, shall I tell you something?
 Rajiv is a dunce"
"In case you and Rahul don't
 get up close, just remember me"
If she gets the right guidance she'll
 undergo a complete change in one month
"Javed, you got to announce something.
 - Oh yes"
Hear this
"After two months, my parents
 are on going on a world tour"
So what?
 - We can party...
at our beach house in Alibaug.
 - Do you really mean it?
I mean it. For a couple of days.
 It'll be fun
The two of you are also invited
"Damn!
 - As usual, impossible for us"
"Got to do something, buddy.
 Our reputation is at stake"
Is your phone number 6395795?
Yours?
Yours?
How could it be?
 Because it's my number
"I mean, 6395795
 is my telephone number"
Find a solution to our problem!
 - For Alibaug...
We need a girlfriend.
 - One?
"All right, one for him too.
 - Why does he need one?"
He already has one waiting for him.
 - Who?
"Payal.
 - I told you, didn't I?"
I'm tired of telling him that
"Rocky...
 - Fall in line, man"
"Mambo, you've been blacklisted
 for poor attendance"
Damn!
 - Then I should also be blacklisted
"Impossible. Payal acts
 as your proxy, after all"
"I told you! Stay here, I'm off.
 - Go on"
See how multipurpose is your
 girlfriend? There's no time. So think
You won't lose any time in wooing her.
 - No Rocky. Payal is not my type
She might be expecting that we
 fall in love seriously with each other
"But no, thanks. I wish to stay away
 from love and its labor"
"Sonny, just woo her. After you've
 had enough just show her the door"
Quite tough. She won't give in.
 And her looks... so simple
If you wish you can give Payal a new
 look. Remember the Traditional Day?
You won't make a mockery of yourself.
 She'll look good
"With girls,
 I'm never wrong"
No. She might get serious with me
 and be a pain in my neck
"You're concerned
 only with Alibaug, no?"
"Woo her first. After you return,
 dump her"
How do I put it before her?
Get her to the garden
 in ten minutes. I'll train you
She is a decent girl.
 - You aren't bad either. Know Kabir?
Which class is he in?
 - The poet Kabir
"Do it today, not tomorrow.
 Do it now, not today"
"Twice yes?
 - I said, sir"
You're from my class?
 - Yes sir. Rajiv Mathur
Strange. Never seen you before
Full attendance. I guess
 you have a dear friend in this class
"Not a friend sir, a girlfriend!"
Damn you!
"Do it today, not tomorrow.
 Do it now, not today"
Now!
Now?
 - I need to talk to you. It's urgent
What is it?
 - Can't tell you here. Outside
Now!
 - Now...?
"Yes. Do it today, not tomorrow.
 Do it now, not today"
Know poet Kabir...?
"Payal, he is right.
 We're disturbing the entire class"
Know what? For the first time
 I have bunked a lecture
"Where the hell is Rocky?
 - It's strange, but it feels good"
Out of the blue! What's come
 over him? Why did he call me...?
Actually Payal...
well...
"It's my first time, that's why
 I'm not able to speak it out..."
What is it? There is something you
 want to tell me that makes you nervous
"Come on Rajiv, you've known me
 for years. Out with it. What is it?"
Must be some Dolly or Saloni
 in mini-skirts
I don't know how and when it happened.
 But I'm sure it's love
"So, who is it?
 - No one... no one"
No one? What do you mean?
 - There's no one behind that tree
"Come on Rajiv,
 this is no time to joke"
"So tell me, who is she...?
 - What?"
"I mean, it's you Payal"
"What...?
 - I mean it, Payal. I love you"
Where are they?
 - Who?
Your flunkies. I know they are
 hiding and watching this farce
"No Payal...
 - You are pulling my leg, right?"
Cook up!
"No Payal, I mean it.
 Actually, I always felt for you"
"But I deliberately avoided it,
 because I never wanted to fall in love"
"But the truth is, the more I held back,
 the more the feelings rose for you"
The swine is a natural!
"Rajiv, I... you..."
"Tell me honestly, Payal.
 You love me, don't you?"
I'm in love with you.
 But I don't know since when
"But I was afraid,
 maybe you chose not me..."
"but the likes of Dolly and Saloni,
 modern and bold"
I still don't believe
 that you love me
"Those eyes,
 those sweet words you speak..."
ruined my sleep...
robbed my peace...
invaded my dreams...
and made me belong to you
Made me belong to you...
invaded my dreams...
and slowly taught me love
"By and by you snatched
 the peace of my heart"
In thoughts of you...
I spend my days and nights
This world...
is a farce without you
How I pine...
how do I tell you?
"I can't forget you
 even for a moment"
"All day, all night..."
my heart...
expects you. Why?
"Slowly and gently
 you snatched my peace"
My friend is no more a friend...
"What's up, smarty?
 - Smart alec!"
"I've seen it all. What's happening?
 - Nothing serious, Mambo"
"Shut up. I'm talking to you, madam.
 How do I address you henceforth?"
Payal? Or Sister-in-law?
"You wooed her, and you
 didn't even tell me?"
Are you mad? Would I forget you?
 That too for Payal?
"Don't lie. After the two of you hit
 it off, forget going out with me..."
you haven't even called me up.
 That's a mean friend!
"Mambo, this is temporary.
 It's only a matter of few days"
What do you mean?
 - The setup is all for Alibaug
No wonder all of a sudden
 you got Payal...
No! Payal isn't that type.
 - We're concerned only about Alibaug
"After that, bye-bye"
Payal won't allow you to do anything.
 - I know. I'm still holding her arms
May I have this?
 - Put it down!
Can we also play?
"We heard everything. You and Payal
 have it going, don't you?"
Who told you?
 - I...? Nope
"Pal, try your best,
 but you can't hide a pimple and love"
Oh no. Payal is not my type.
 She's hundred percent nun
"Why must you compare me with her?
 Don't insult me, guys"
I still can't believe
 it's all happening with me
"What feelings I have for Rajiv,
 the same he has for me"
Maybe she's content with the rumors
 if not for an affair
Could be. Why don't we
 ask Payal herself?
"Tell us something, Payal"
So you guys have it going?
 - Yes. Why do you ask?
Just checking. Because Rajiv
 just said that it's all rubbish
I ought to worship you guys
Imagine Rajiv with me! You can't
 link him to me and insult him
You guys know that I'm not his type.
 Right Mambo?
"And I am... well, what am I called?
 - Nun"
"And a nun can't be
 a girlfriend, right?"
I've been asked this question thrice
 since morning. I'm tired of saying no
Finally I decided to say yes
 if I am asked again
"Dolly, I think I got to put
 a placard around my neck saying..."
"Nothing's going on between
 Rajiv and Payal"
"Bye, I'm getting late"
"By the way Rajiv,
 I did not spread the rumors"
What have you done?
 - I messed
"I warned you against doing it.
 - Don't chide me, please. Let me think"
Go and placate her
Go!
"Please Rajiv, I don't want to talk.
 Go away, please"
Please! Don't say sorry. A sorry can't
 make up for a deliberate mistake
Please listen to me.
 - I don't want to hear a thing
Know why I didn't want
 to tell them about us...?
"I wanted to give them a surprise
 in the end, Payal"
"Look, I don't know much about love.
 All I know is, true love is not hidden"
Payal what I did was
 maybe my weakness
"And, I could never do
 what you did for me back there"
"All right, if you don't believe me,
 come with me"
Meet her. Payal.
 My girlfriend
"From now on, no one teases her.
 And no one calls a nun anymore"
Are you okay?
 - Yes
"Not near my building!
 If my Daddy sees, he'll bash us up"
Goodness!
Scared?
 - No... I'm not
I know you in and out.
 Bye now
Are you crazy?
Madcap
"Priya, open the door"
Hi aunt. This is Payal.
 - Hi Payal. How are you?
I'm fine.
 - It's been long since you came over
I will certainly come.
 How are Priya and uncle?
All are fine. How about Bittu?
 - He's fine
Here... talk to Rajiv.
 - Who is it?
Thank God you aren't angry.
 I thought you wouldn't talk to me
Nothing of the sort.
 Hang on
You want to speak to her?
 - No. Why?
No. You mind if I...?
 - Oh! All right
Tell me fast. I don't have time.
 - What's this sudden change?
Yes. Tell me.
 - I just called to say sorry
So say it fast and hang up.
 I have other things to do
Over? Shall I hang up now?
 - No... I wanted to tell you something
Hold the receiver close to your ears
Speak
Stupid! Are you crazy?
 What if someone hears?
No one can hear!
 I'm home alone!
How come?
 - My parents...
have gone for a housewarming.
 - I'm coming over
"No!
 - No, no..."
"Rajiv, you are not coming.
 - A girl's denial is consent, I know"
I'm coming
Rajiv! You're mad!
 You've really turned up?
Come on inside
The house is a changed place!
 Hi Chikki...
"Not here, Rajiv!
 Let's go inside!"
"If the neighbour sees us together,
 it'll hit the headlines tomorrow"
C'mon!
"I thought you were kidding, Rajiv.
 And you really landed up?"
Not there... get up!
You don't know what sort
 of neighbours we have
What sort?
 - They're mad like you
Where are you going?
 - To fetch some water
Never mind. Come back here
Did you miss me?
 - What will you do if I told you?
It's just for my information.
 - You don't need such information
Now tell me... please
"Yes, I did.
 - How much?"
This much.
 - Is that all?
"All right, this much.
 - That's all?"
This much?
"Rajiv, what are you doing?"
"Okay, I won't touch you"
Won't you give me something to drink?
 - What will you have? Coffee? Tea?
Nothing else?
Why did you touch my personal
 diary without asking me?
"You know, I don't let
 anyone..."
"Since when, Payal...?
 I had no inkling"
"Neither does my fear go away,
 nor do I get any sleep..."
"nor even do I find peace
 for a moment"
"Neither am I in my senses,
 nor are you in yours..."
"I wonder what intoxication
 overwhelms us"
It makes us pine thus
What are we going to do?
 - There's someone at the door
My folks! They're back!
Go and open the door
Must I? Are you sure?
"How long did you take, Payal?
 We've been ringing the doorbell"
"You're back very early, Papa?
 - There was no traffic on the roads"
Why did you take such a long time
 to open the door?
"I had plugged in the walkman,
 I couldn't hear the bell"
Something surely is fishy.
 - Nothing except you is fishy
No...
There's no one
Your brains are rotting watching
 all those silly programmes on TV
Your teeth will rot too.
 Brush your teeth and go to bed
Where...?
 - Near the window!
Over here
What are you doing?
 - Nothing will happen
Have you gone mad...?
"Here's the offering, Payal. You ought
 to have gone with us"
Everyone was asking about you
It was such a lovely house. We almost
 fell when we saw the bathroom
"Go away, lady...
 else, I'll fall"
I've got work to do
Payal...
 - Coming!
"As usual, they must be out bowling.
 Where else will they go?"
"Why aren't you eating
 something, Payal?"
"Thanks, but I'm fasting.
 - At least have some wafers"
"No, I can't eat wafers either.
 - A soft drink?"
I can't even drink water.
 - You talk as if you were...
"fasting for your husband's long life!
 - Quite an idea, you bet"
Imagine fasting for the spouse!
 For him? No way
What are you saying?
 - It's so stupid!
It isn't stupid at all.
 Actually I can say that...
because I know how nice I'm feeling.
 - You mean...
you're really fasting for
 your spouse's long life?
"For whom?
 - Stupid! For Rajiv, obviously"
Why would she fast for you?
 - Nobody fasts for me anyway
Take a lesson from her. Love isn't
 just going to the discos and parties
This is part of it too.
 - Lucky guy
"If I'm not wrong, you end your fast
 when your spouse feeds you. Right?"
"In that case, I'll be coming over.
 - Why? You're not my husband"
And my parents will be there.
 - So?
I'll still come. Just you see
I'll still come. Just you see
Hello lady!
"Rajiv, you've really landed here!"
I come with here with
 so much of difficulty...
and you don't even look at me?
 - Actually...
I thought I was imagining things
"Now that I'm here,
 let's get started"
What's this?
 - Not like that. Come with me
"What did Mummy do first...?
 Yes, the little ritual"
Do it properly
How much will you do?
 That's enough
Now... the vermillion
Water!
That's it!
 - Feed me! I've eaten nothing
Eat tomorrow
Touch my feet
Complete the ritual
"May you live long,
 may your husband live long"
May you have a hundred sons
"You don't know how much
 all this means to me, Rajiv"
This isn't just a ritual...
 it's my love for you
And whatever happens...
 I'll always want you to be happy
And may you always find
 what you seek
"Payal, what are you doing in there?
 - Your mother!"
I'm changing!
 - They won't let us enjoy any peace
"Rajiv, go away"
We'll complete the rest of
 the action in Alibaug. Okay?
Who's going?
 - You
No way! Impossible!
An overnight picnic...?
 - Why not?
You think Papa will permit me?
 No way!
What are we going to do?
Say yes!
 - All right. Let's try
Be quick with whatever you do
I'll be back
"So what's happening, lover-boy?
 You've been climbing pipes, I hear?"
You said you didn't want any love
 and romance. So what gives?
There's nothing of the sort.
 It's simply...
Your face says it all.
 You're in love
"Why must you lie to Rocky?
 - There's nothing of the sort, Rocky"
Forget everything else.
 Go away to Alibaug
I'll talk to you later
"Please, Uncle. It's only
 for two days"
"Two days or three, my daughter isn't
 staying away from home in the night"
Our parents have said that we'll get
 the permission only if Payal goes
"Why is that?
 - It's all about trust, Uncle"
Our folks trust Payal
 more than they trust us
They are amazed at the values
 she has imbibed
"Obviously, all the credit
 goes to her parents"
"What do you say, Payal?
 - I won't be going if you object, Papa"
Good. Don't go then
All right. Go ahead
What say?
 - You guys are so late
"Mambo, aren't you coming?"
You don't have a girl.
 How will you join us?
"Should we take him along, girls?"
"All right, I'll come"
Immersed
"My heart is immersed
 in your eyes"
"My heart is immersed
 in your eyes"
You're a beauty...
of my making
You're my beloved
"Your heart is immersed
 in my eyes"
You aren't Romeo...
nor are you Majnu
You're a big wonder
You and I...
make a love-story
"Don't you ever forget it,
 make sure"
You're a virgin
I'm a virgin
"To you, I've lost my heart"
Come closer to me
If I don't have you...
I won't have another man
"My heart is immersed
 in your eyes"
"Your heart is immersed
 in my eyes"
You're a beauty...
of my making
"You aren't Romeo,
 nor are you Majnu"
You're a big wonder
You ought to have
 looked at his face!
See the expression
 on our hero's face?
He won't even touch her
 for fear of doing something wrong
No sweat
Sit down
"Know what, Rajiv? I always dreamed
 of things turning out like this"
You and me... far away
 from home like this
I can't believe it's
 all really happening
"Yes, me too"
"Rajiv, there's a question I've
 been wanting to ask you"
Go ahead.
 - Look at me
What was it about me that you...
"You don't need a reason
 to fall in love, stupid"
"I don't think you need a reason.
 - Oh yes, we do"
"Several reasons, in fact"
So tell me. What did
 you like about me?
You love to show off
But you have a very nice heart
"Know what, Rajiv?
 I can blindly trust you"
I'm sure you will never
 betray my trust
And there's something
 I didn't tell you
I haven't seen anyone climb
 the pipes like you do!
Your turn now
It's your ears... that take
 my voice to you
"Your beauty,
 your hair..."
your back...
I'm telling you
 what I like about you
"What are you doing, Rajiv...?"
"Stop it, Rajiv!
 Have you gone mad?"
"What's wrong with this, Payal?"
"One moment, Rajiv... cool down"
"I love you, Payal! Are you mad?
 - I love you too, but..."
"Let me go, please!"
"Stop it! This isn't right, okay?
 - So why did I bring you here?"
I understand! You pretended to be
 in love with me...
so I'd come here and
 you would...
"I can see the truth now, Rajiv"
Ever since you planned this
 trip to Alibaug...
you started this drama
 of love with me
And what a fool I was!
 I couldn't see through you!
"Even in my house the other day,
 you tried to force yourself on me!"
And I was so blind!
 I refused to believe...
it was my body you were after!
Who do you think you are?
I can find a thousand girls like you
 to fall in love with
But I don't want these
 hassles of love
I thought we'd have a nice time
 in Alibaug and soon forget it
But you have other plans!
 As for the rest of them...
"they called you a nun! I'm the one
 who gave you a standard, a level"
Who do you think you are?
What are you guys staring at?
No. There's no need to make
 either her or me see reason
I did what I thought was right
 and she did was she thought was right
"C'mon, guys.
 We're no kids"
Actually...
"I forgot to tell
 you something, Payal"
Danny had laced Rajiv's drink
 with something. And...
"he had lost his senses,
 he didn't know what he was doing"
"Now look, Rajiv. If your ego
 doesn't permit you to bow..."
we can always ask Payal
 to say sorry to you
"Right. She was the one
 who took offense, isn't it?"
So what if she took offense?
 Who created the situation?
It's his mistake!
 - All right...
who led him by the hand anyway?
 - Really?
The hero and the heroine are here.
 Let the extras move on
"Yes, wait here, all of you"
"Rajiv, I was a bit..."
"You ought to have
 thought of it then, Payal"
"But it all happened so suddenly,
 I had no time to think"
And you insulted me. You slapped me
 in everybody's presence
"And you spoke any nonsense
 you wanted to, right?"
I wasn't just a roadside thug either
Whatever I did was because
 I took you for my own
And what did you give me in return?
What happened that day
 can happen every now and then
"How can you say that, Rajiv?"
It's because this wall is
 going to stand between us
"What's gotten into you, Rajiv?
 - Why? Do you feel bad?"
"All right, if you think there's
 no wall between us..."
"right now, in everybody's presence..."
kiss me
Have you gone mad?
 - Why?
She can slap me in everybody's presence
 but she can't kiss me?
"Forget it, Payal"
My love isn't so weak.
 I don't have to do something...
so cheap to prove it's worth
See? I told you.
 But you guys wouldn't listen
"Rajiv, this isn't right.
 You're going to regret this"
He'll go without a girl
 all his life
What do you think? You'll find
 a better girl than Payal?
You guys are flying because
 you've got girlfriends?
"All right, but remember..."
"some day, the most beautiful girl
 in college will be with me"
Name?
"Hurry, she'll go away!"
Wait... what's up?
 - What a gal!
Who...?
 - She's too much
She's at the principal's office.
 Everyone's floored!
Floored...?
Who is she?
Who is she?
"Who's she
 with the pearl eyes?"
"Who's she with
 the golden hair?"
"Who's she with
 the silvery body?"
"Who's she with the
 provocative gait?"
Who's she...?
"A million faces I've seen,
 none of them I remember"
"The moment she arrives,
 every other face fades away"
"What stuff is she made of?
 What's her name?"
"Where does she live?
 What's she into?"
"She sports a red scarf,
 high-heeled shoes..."
and a silk top
"I've never seen
 anything like this before"
"Talk to this fairy
 from a distance"
You might offend her
Every heart beats for me...
every lip thirsts for me
"They're crazy for my love,
 my love is what they seek"
"I possess the charm
 and the mischief"
"I hold sway
 over every heart"
"A million beauties there might be,
 but there isn't one like me"
"So many young boys
 have gone crazy after me"
I cast a spell with my beauty
"He who casts a look at me
 is enthralled"
"Who's she
 with the pearl eyes?"
"Who's she with
 the golden hair?"
"Who's she with
 the silvery body?"
"Who's she with the
 provocative gait?"
Who's she...?
In a world of your dreams!
"Boss, stop thinking of her"
"She's rich, out of reach...
 and I'm sure... a bitch"
"Forget all this and patch
 it up with Payal, Rajiv"
What's that about Payal?
"Rajiv, you don't know
 how lucky you are"
"Let me tell you, Rajiv.
 In love, you can't..."
What love...?
You're going to teach me
 about love? You?
No girl even looks at you
"And you'll teach me about love...?
 No, don't teach me about love. Okay?"
"Sachin, where's Rocky?
 - I don't know"
"You'll know say, "I'm sorry" and
 I'll say, "It's okay"
"And you'll say, Im really very sorry
 and I'll say, "It's fine"
"But since you're not saying a word,
 let me say it"
She was right!
"Now, that's a real item.
 Isn't she?"
How about Payal? Is it all over?
 - Yes
Never mind. I did my best.
 - Tell me something about this girl
"I'll get the dope on her,
 but it'll take some time"
"I can't wait much longer, Rocky.
 When we ran into each other just now..."
we were so close! I couldn't
 take my eyes off her face
How much time will it take?
 - Can't say. But your job will be done
Where's Mambo?
 - Forget about him
"Mohit, you wanted details
 on Jyotika, didn't you?"
No! She has become so fat!
"Look at him! After all my hard work,
 waste of time and energy...!"
"You won't act like him, will you?
 - No, Rocky. I'm not stepping back"
"Whatever happens, Rocky.
 I want Alisha"
"Rajiv, where's Payal?
 - I don't know"
She doesn't telephone
 nor come to my house
Name your business.
 - Here you are
What's this?
 - Payal's book. She gave it to me
It was with me for many days. Return
 it to her and say sorry on my behalf
I must say sorry to Payal?
 She's not meeting me
But the two of you
 are in the same college!
This ghost of Payal refuses
 to be exorcised!
One mistake I made...
I fell in love with you
Secretly...
I cried...
"you gave me
 so much of sorrow"
"O ignorant, wicked one..."
inflict every tyranny on me
My love for you will never lessen
"I swear it on the tears
 I shed for you"
I have truly loved you
Father's name: Harshvardhan Sahay.
 Mother's name Radhika Sahay
Name of father's current wife:
 Anjali Sahay
Name of mother's current boyfriend:
 Sunil Arora
Tell me about Alisha. Please
Rich. She has won the
 beauty contest thrice
The most important fact. Her favorite
 sportsman is... Sachin Tendulkar
I can't tell you how crazy
 she is about him
Sachin dominates every place!
"In short, there's just
 one of getting to Alisha"
What?
 - Sachin
Stop kidding and tell me
 what we're going to do
Let's have a word with Sachin.
 I do know him
My postman's nephew
 is Sachin's liftman
I don't think this
 connection is working
There is a way.
 - What?
Let's think
"If my boss gets to know,
 I'm going to be fired"
It's for just ten minutes
Drop him at the
 first bus stop you see
Doesn't such a great cricketer
 have a car?
"Tax problems, you see. No wonder
 he's traveling in buses"
I saw Agarkar going on foot too
See my palm and tell me.
 Will I score a century?
"Let her come.
 - Sorry, this is my first time"
My first time too. I've never
 pulled off a bigger stunt
Sachin!
Wow! What a piece!
See my palm and tell me.
 Will I score a century?
"Your stars are pretty strong,
 but there's a problem"
Alisha! Your classmate's
 reading Sachin's palm!
Know what?
 Open the innings
He knows Sachin!
"Sorry, I forgot.
 - Happens when you have a fleet of cars"
Did you get the dough?
 - Yes. Rocky already gave it to me
See you
"I ought to be moving, Sachin"
Don't put on airs.
 It will make a difference to me
"I'll try, but do as I said
 and you'll have good results. Okay?"
Say hi to your wife and tell her
 I'm coming over for lunch
You always say that but
 you don't really come over
I'll surely come. Bye
He's gone
Never mind. I'll catch up with him
 at the college tomorrow
Do you know Rajiv Mathur?
God! She's looking at me!
 She wants to talk to me...
"the secret isn't out, is it?
 Let me see"
Have you seen Rajiv Mathur around?
 - Rajiv...?
No
Rajiv! Your work is done!
 She's looking for you!
Our formula is a hit!
 She's pining for you
"No, at the right time!
 Let the iron get hotter"
And then... strike!
What happened?
 - Payal!
Have you seen Rajiv around?
 Rajiv Mathur?
"No, I've just arrived.
 He must be around somewhere"
He has come to the college.
 - How do you know?
His bike's out there
"You even know his bike number?
 - Yes, because..."
I've been looking for you!
"You're taking part in the
 cultural festival, aren't you?"
I'm interested in dancing too.
 - Really?
Can I come to your rehearsals?
"Rajiv, when are they starting?
 - Come over from tomorrow"
I'll surely come
"By the way, I saw Sachin Tendulkar
 at the Club yesterday"
Really?
 - What's interesting is that...
there was this boy with him
 who looked just like you
Shit! I told him we shouldn't
 meet at the club!
"That's a secret.
 Please don't tell anyone, okay?"
"Actually, Sachin and I have played
 cricket together since we were kids"
"I must be half his age, but he was
 crazy about my square-cut"
You know what he says to me? He says
 that whenever he scores a century...
"he raises a bat to me at the TV cameras,
 only then is it for the spectators"
I saw how he reacted when
 you were reading his palm...
Don't tell anyone that I can
 read palms. That's a secret too
It's only because Sachin and I are
 such good friends. Or else...
"Read my palm, please!
 - No"
"Else, I'll tell everyone that
 you're good at palmistry!"
He's holding her hand!
"Not here, else I'll be running
 a business in college from tomorrow"
May you have a thousand sons!
 Step on the brakes!
You'll enjoy it!
This is a royal palm!
Your mound of Venus is excellent
"In fact, every mounds of yours
 is so lovely"
Rascal!
 - Look at this
It says you're a typical...
 - Cancer?
"I knew it. Once you take a hand,
 you'll never let go"
"Alisha, people have noticed
 only your outward beauty"
No one has looked in your heart
"Despite having so many friends,
 you're so very lonely"
Oh yes! It says that although
 Mr. Perfect is right before you...
you're not being able to recognize him!
 - Really?
I have a similar line
 in my palm
"We aren't meant for
 each other, are we?"
And look at this!
 - What?
What's the name...? Rajiv!
A boy called Rajiv is going
 to buy you a coke
See? Isn't my prediction immediate?
I hope you're enjoying yourselves.
 Right now...
it's a round of the painting
 competition at stall number 25
We've got to win the prize
 for dancing and painting
"This doesn't look fake, does it?
 - You doubt Rocky's funda?"
"Oh no, I simply asked.
 - If she's convinced..."
your job is done!
"My God!
 What's happened to you, Rajiv?"
I'm depending on you
 for the dance and you...
"You're my main dancer, remember?
 - I know that, but what do I do?"
Listen...
What's happened to Rajiv's arm?
 - Forget it
God has punished him
 for what he did
I must ask him
What happened?
It's nothing.
 I'll be okay in a week
Which means it isn't a fracture.
 - No
"How did it happen?
 - Well... I fell down, you know"
How?
 - I...
"You weren't climbing a pipe, were you?
 - Oh no!"
"Won't you say all the best"?"
How will you dance now?
 - I'll have to manage
It sure was a wrong number
The winner of the painting
 competition is...
Ms Payal from Spencer College!
"What happened to you, Rajiv?
 - I was going on my bike..."
"You broke your arm?
 - No, I love wearing a sling!"
The dance competition
 is about to begin
Please don't tell Rajiv about it.
 - What?
How he broke his arm.
 - How?
He was actually going on his bike
 to buy romantic cards for you...
For me? Why?
 - It's obvious
He's in love with you
Welcome to the last round of the
 inter-collegiate dance competition
We have so far seen
 other colleges perform
It's now the turn of Spencer College
We're going to lose!
 Rajiv has broken his arm
What was the hurry?
You could've bought the cards
 even later
"I'm not quitting college, am I?"
So you've got to know?
 - I know everything
"How, Alisha?
 - Never mind that"
See what your stupidity has done.
 Everyone is so tensed
"You mean, you are tensed too?"
"I can bear to see anything,
 but I can't see you in this state"
"What are you doing, Rajiv...?
 What?"
"I can do anything for you, Alisha"
We belong to each other!
"Why's every beautiful girl
 crazy after me?"
"Why do they all say
 I love you to me?"
"Is my face really
 so romantic?"
"Yes, it is!"
"Are my eyes those
 of the dreamy lover?"
"Yes, they are!"
"I possess just one heart
 and there are a thousand girls"
"I wish I could split my heart into
 tiny pieces and give it to everyone"
Is it fun?
"You just saw the first sequence
 from Spencer College"
"Here comes Alisha Sahay
 with a surprise item!"
"If you're good looking,
 I'm young too"
"Look at me from any angle you will.
 I'm no lesser than you are"
"Lightning strikes the hearts
 of those who behold us"
"There's no one more beautiful
 than me"
"So let go of my arm...
 let me go"
"With a smile,
 they rob us of our peace..."
these beautiful girls
"They keep us awake
 night after night..."
these beautiful girls
"They set our
 hearts hammering..."
these beautiful girls
They make us pine...
these beautiful girls
"To their charm, to their eyes,
 to their age..."
I'm sold
what am I to do?
Of those spell-casting eyes...
I'm a lover of my beloved
"I can't tell you
 what fun this is"
"This is the intoxication
 of love"
You have taken my heart away
You have driven me crazy
My heart-beat sings for you...
"and I've fallen in love,
 oh so gradually"
"Payal, what happened?
 - Nothing"
You find your love...
with great difficulty
Love...
Love and romance
Meet her gaze
"Every one falls in love
 at least once in a lifetime"
Love and romance
The judges have decided the winners
 of today's dance competition...
Let's congratulate Rajiv
"You've been so silly, Alisha"
Your Mr. Right has been
 right before your eyes...
and you didn't even recognize him?
"He's the one you've been
 looking for, Alisha"
Because he can do
 anything for you
What's this...?
Give me your blessings
Bless me too
"Something's burning, isn't it?"
Sit down
When are you introducing me
 to Sachin?
"Sachin...? Oh, Sachin!
 Any time you wish to"
"Let me get something to eat.
 Hungry, aren't you?"
That's forty bucks...
 and another twenty
Anything else?
"Coming up, Princess!"
"At this rate, I'll have to go
 around with a begging bowl"
"Parag, do you have a hundred bucks?
 - Yes"
Give it to me.
 - What?
"The hundred bucks, I told you.
 - When did you?"
"You asked if I have it, I said yes.
 - Stop driving me up the wall!"
I'll return it to you the moment
 I get my pocket money
You will? Are you sure?
 - Of course
That's 110?
 - Yes
"What's happening, dude?
 - I'm going mad!"
She's more worried about Sachin!
 - I knew that was coming
She's asking me to introduce her
 to Sachin. What am I to say?
Don't say anything.
 - So who will? Sachin?
What's for dinner tonight?
Sachin will call you in two minutes!
 - Sachin? What does that mean?
Sachin's calling you
 in two minutes. That's it!
Damn it! Oh yes!
What're you doing?
 - That's my hundred bucks too
Here's your spread.
 - I'm famished
Who's that...? Sachin!
Go on. Where are you calling from?
"Well? Scoring with her, are you?"
Oh yes. So how have you been?
 - A scoundrel. Like you
Oh yes
The name? Alisha
You want to talk to her?
Guess what? You're one of the few
 sports persons she likes very much
Don't talk too much.
 It goes to his head
Rajiv is always talking about you
"When are we meeting, Sachin?"
Whenever I'm in Mumbai for a couple
 of days at a stretch
"Before that, we'll have
 to ask Rajiv"
"So decide quickly, okay?"
Sure. Please give
 the telephone to Rajiv
"Yes, Sachin...?
 Everything is all right"
"Just take care of those pitched
 outside the off stump, okay?"
Pay my regards to your wife
Let's go. I want to go home.
 - How about the food?
My stomach is full!
 I've spoken to Sachin!
"Let's go.
 - Okay, let's go"
"No, Mama. I won't eat outside"
Here's your hundred bucks.
 Eat it up
This is the first time
 I'm dropping Alisha home
Must I kiss her or mustn't I?
Must I ask her?
"Actually, I'll hold
 her hand first..."
My heart took the blow...
"and I started
 falling in love"
"My heart took a liking
 to the stranger"
We crazed lovers...
now pray...
all our lives...
"may the story of our love
 continue"
"In my dreams,
 he quietly appears"
He robs me of my peace
In your arms...
let me remain
Let me kiss your lips
This weather of pining...
clouds everything else
"May our love story
 continue through our lives"
"Payal, I'm going
 to the library"
Mambo's not around.
 Where has he gone?
He should be coming any moment.
 You can wait here for him
Writing the notes for me?
 - No. For Mambo
"Payal, you know about Alisha
 and me, don't you...?"
"Besides, we're always going
 to be friends. Right?"
"Hi, Mambo. What's cooking?
 - Let's talk later, okay?"
Aren't you ready yet?
 Hurry up!
The ad says we mustn't miss
 the beginning of the film
Are you coming...?
 See you later
Don't they look cute together?
 - Who?
"Mambo and Payal, of course"
I think something's brewing
 between the two of them
"What nonsense!
 They're old friends, that's all"
"I know that, but they've gone
 to see a film together"
"So? They invited me too.
 - Just a formality, buddy"
"C'mon, Javed. I know Payal. She
 won't encourage someone like Mambo"
"In any case, why must I be worried
 if something's on between them?"
Don't get angry
She's so sweet!
My sister Priya.
 Alisha... Kamlabai
Who's that?
Must be Rajiv's classmate.
 Why?
She appears to come
 from a rich family
"The richer they are,
 the lesser clothes they wear"
Close your mouth.
 You're drooling
Let's go and see
Please be seated
She has just arrived from Ooty
 and recently joined the college
She has won quite a few
 beauty contests too
She does appear to be a model
What appear...?
 She is indeed a model
She's getting so many offers.
 Only yesterday...
"Aunty, Rajiv has this habit of hiding
 his own qualities from people"
What qualities does he possess?
Take Sachin for instance. He...
 - There's someone at the door!
Who's Sachin?
 - Must be the thin boy in the building
"I've been waiting for you
 for such a long time, Payal!"
"Payal! After all these days!
 - Are you angry with us, dear?"
"Will you have something, Alisha?
 - No thanks, aunty"
"Rajiv, will you come here please?
 - Coming"
What does your mother do? Is she
 a housewife or is she working?
Or is she a model too?
Where is the book I asked
 you to give Payal?
Must be around...
"I must leave now, Priya.
 - You've just come!"
You aren't going anywhere.
 - I'll come again
"Shall we leave, Rajiv?
 - Yes. Let me drop you home"
"Drop Payal home too.
 - No, I'll go on my own"
"Take the car, Rajiv"
Your hair has grown too much
What happened?
 - Nothing
And I thought Payal
 is an old friend of yours
"How long have you known Rajiv, Payal?
 - Since our childhood"
I'll sit with you some day and
 get to know all his secrets
"Sorry, we've driven past your place.
 - It's okay. I'm quite used to it"
"But she's a bit reserved,
 isn't she?"
Pray that I receive a call
 from the ad agency
"If I sign the contract, I'll
 definitely be one of the top models"
What happened?
 - What's your problem?
"Forget it, Rajiv...
 they're kids"
Kids?
You...
"Don't give them so much
 of importance, Rajiv"
It happens all the time
Why do you need
 to wear such clothes?
"Rajiv, this is how
 I've always been"
And not even my Papa has ever
 said anything to me
"I can very well handle
 such situations, Rajiv"
Here start the calls
"Hurry up, I want to make a call.
 - Okay"
"Must be a girl, isn't it?
 My son, after all"
"He has taken after me in looks!
 - Spare him, please. If not me"
I know whose call it is
So you've even forgotten
 my voice now?
May you find success in
 everything you do...
and you will never
 forget your old friends
"What special plans for the day?
 - Nothing as yet, but..."
Which means my treat
 remains doubtful
"No, it's not that"
You needn't think so much
"Mine is the first call, isn't it?
 - Oh yes, yours is the first"
I knew it! And guess what?
 You're very lucky for me!
Because I've received a call for
 my first shoot on your birthday
Wow! When is it?
 - Today!
Today...?
 - That's where I'm calling from
"After pack up, I'll meet you
 at the Velocity"
I'll ask Tony to invite
 everyone there
"Alisha, the shot is ready.
 - Gotta go, Rajiv!"
"Relax, Rajiv.
 She's surely coming"
Drink it up!
Have some water
"Danny, why don't you listen?"
Are you okay?
Are you enjoying yourself?
Are you enjoying yourself?
 - Yes
Yours was the first call
 this morning
That's what I've been
 doing all these years
"I don't know whether I have the right,
 Rajiv. But here you are anyway"
So you remembered?
 - Not a word from you
"I thought you didn't like going to
 the discotheques, Payal"
That's the problem.
 No one ever asked me
"Mambo asked me today
 and I said, why not"
What happened?
What for?
"You know, Rajiv. I've begun to realize
 that I haven't understood myself either"
"At times, I think
 you were always right"
Love and romance...
 mean nothing
The things I thought right don't
 fit into the scheme of things today
The ideals I clung to make me look
 like a fool today
That's not...
 - That is true!
You look so happy with Alisha
You never looked so happy with me
Because I never possessed
 what Alisha has
"Things you wanted.
 - You possess it all, Payal"
"You're understanding,
 very caring..."
"you're so sweet, you have
 such a large heart and..."
"What good is all that?
 I'm not Alisha, after all"
"Payal, you...
 - Know something, Rajiv"
"I've always believed in letting
 my love go free, if it wishes to"
"If it returns to me,
 it is indeed mine"
If it doesn't...
"you didn't return to me, Rajiv"
"Don't say that, Payal.
 It was my mistake"
"I was the one who did wrong,
 you were always right"
Please don't blame yourself.
 Please
"Honey, you're forgetting something"
You didn't ask me
 how my shoot went
How did it go?
 - Great! Superb!
I got...
"what happened, Rajiv?
 - Nothing"
"The director made me so comfortable,
 I didn't realize it was my first shoot"
Mambo...
 - Yes?
"What are you up to, Mambo?
 - What?"
Payal's a nice girl. So don't...
You're telling me all this? You?
 How about what you did to her?
So don't lecture me.
 What does she mean to you...
There was another reason for whatever
 happened between Payal and me
"But I just can't trust you, okay?
 - I see! You can't trust me!"
What happened to the trust
 Payal placed in you?
Forget it. Don't worry about her
She can't go around with a guy who
 won't even spare the maidservants!
If you do anything with Payal...
 - What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
 - I'll forget you're my friend
"Rajiv, what's happening here?"
Let's go!
"What is the matter, Rajiv? Where to?
 - Home"
"What is the matter?
 - Nothing, let's go"
"It's your birthday, Rajiv!
 Now tell me what happened"
Nothing has happened.
 I just have a headache
I don't think it's a headache.
 It's something else
"Since I've arrived, I've found you
 paying more attention to Payal and Mambo"
"The two of you weren't fighting
 over Payal, were you...?"
"It's nothing, let's go. Please"
"How did your
 economics paper go, Mambo?"
The questions were pretty easy.
 Answering them was tough
Careful...
What are you doing?
"Candy, what's the story
 behind Payal and Rajiv?"
Story? Nothing at all
What does that mean?
 - It means they were in love
They were friends from childhood
 and it turned into love
"They unfortunately broke up and that
 is when you joined college, isn't it?"
I wonder how you don't know.
 Everybody knows about it
One moment...
 - What happened?
What do you think? I'm blind
 and cannot see?
"He belongs to me. Whatever you do,
 you can't have him from me again"
If you want to make your
 ex-boyfriend feel jealous...
pretend to be in love
 with his best friend
If you think you can snatch Rajiv
 from me so easily...
Because he loves only me.
 Only me
What are you doing?
 - I'm not talking to you Mambo
"Mind your own business, loser.
 - This is my business"
What are you going to do about it?
 Don't you dare raise your hand
He raises his hand at girls!
How dare you touch her.
 - Before talking to me...
ask her what she said to Payal!
 - Why are you dragging Payal into this?
"Tell him, Alisha!
 What did you say to Payal?"
It's all Payal's mistake!
 - Payal's?
"Yes, your ex-girlfriend
 Payal's mistake"
She thinks she's very smart
I'm fortunate to have got to know
 everything at the right time
"Else, there's no saying
 what she could have done"
"Get lost, you bastard!
 Go away!"
You hit me for her sake?
Give him a big hand for this!
 Go on!
We're not worthy of you anymore
"Payal and Mambo are
 not to blame, Rajiv"
"What madness is this, Rajiv?
 Payal has done nothing"
"Payal and Mambo are
 not to blame, Rajiv"
Give him a big hand for this!
"What madness is this, Rajiv?
 Payal has done nothing"
You must be thinking that I'm
 being extremely possessive
But what could I have done?
I could see everything
 so clearly
"I love you, Rajiv. And I don't know
 how long I've loved you"
"This isn't just a ritual,
 it's my love for you"
"Know what, Rajiv?
 I can blindly trust you"
I've always felt that you must
 let your love go free
"If it returns to you,
 it is indeed yours"
"Rajiv, you love me too.
 Don't you?"
I don't want to be
 separated from you
"I can do anything for you.
 You do love me, don't you?"
You do love me?
If you guys lace the juice
 with liquor...
How am I looking today?
 - Want me to flatter you?
Or must I speak the truth?
 - Skip the nonsense
I'm going to propose to her today.
 - Don't tell me!
She needs me.
 And I need her too
I hope she agrees
Don't worry.
 She'll definitely agree
You've been my best friend
 and I...
I ask for your forgiveness
 in everybody's presence
Have we never fought before?
 Let it go...
"let it go, please"
"Won't it stink if I let go, Rajiv?"
"I don't know what ego-trip
 I was on, Mambo"
I've hurt everyone...
 especially Payal
But you really recognized
 Payal's true worth
All I will ask you to do
 is to take care of her
But give me one opportunity...
 I want to apologize to her
"I see. You want to say sorry to her?
 Go ahead, son. I give you permission"
"Moron! You always call me
 names, don't you?"
But do you really think
 I'm such a scoundrel?
What do you mean?
"Rajiv, he's crazy about Polly Pereira
 and he's even going to propose to her"
So you're going to propose to Polly?
 - Right
I'm going to do something right
 for the first time in my life
What might she do? Turn me down?
 Slap me...? What else?
And I'm going to do something right
 for the first time in my life too
Or your girlfriend will think
 I'm snatching you from her
"Else, I'll go away"
It's very important for me
 to say this
"Friends, six months ago..."
"in your presence, I had challenged
 Mambo, Payal and the gang..."
that the most beautiful girl in the
 college would be my girlfriend
Maybe I was trying to prove that
 I was stud of this college
Like Javed and Danny. I didn't
 know what love was all about
I didn't accept it
 and I was wrong
"I took Alisha as my girlfriend,
 but I never loved her"
Because I didn't know
 what love meant
And there was this girl who loved me
 right from our childhood...
she always trusted me...
 and I spurned her
And now that I know
 what love is...
I realize what I have lost
I have lost Payal forever
And this is my punishment.
 I deserve it
"Maybe these words are going to sound
 very hollow, coming from me"
I seek your forgiveness
 in everybody's presence today
"Please forgive me, if you can"
This is what you always do.
 You first break my heart...
and do something stupid like this
 and expect me to forgive you
"No, I'm not forgiving you this time"
I don't want to listen
 to another word
Your stupid lecture isn't
 going to make heart melt
"Don't look at me,
 look down!"
The problem is...
 I'm too good for you
You don't deserve me
Why the silly smile?
 I'm not kidding
I have truly loved you
"You have stolen Rajiv from me.
 Haven't you, Payal?"
"I've been a proper fool.
 Haven't I, Rajiv?"
"No, Alisha.
 That's not how it is"
"Your palm says that although your
 Miss Perfect is right before you..."
"you will not be able
 to recognize her"
"I swear, I haven't done anything"
That year I thought I had
 lost Payal forever
"But I guess, love finds
 its own way around"
And where are you folks going?
 The story isn't over yet
Don't you want to know whether
 Mambo finally pitched his tent?
"You do, don't you?
 So take a look"
"My friend says,
 I love you"
You take a year
 to tell me this much?
That's my dad's number.
