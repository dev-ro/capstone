Oh, yes. Alexander Monroe.

I don't.
He took a girl, Nina Fisher,
the one you don't remember,
back to his room,
where he had sex with her
repeatedly
and in front of his friends
while she was too drunk to have
any idea what was going on.
She was covered in bruises

Yes.

You.

your friend Nina,

- Incredible.
- SUSAN: Mm.
Ryan, I hear you're a doctor.
Your parents must be
very, very proud.
Not really.
Uh, they wanted me to be a DJ.
(chuckles awkwardly)
(laughing)
He's funny.
- (Stanley continues laughing)
- Yeah.
STANLEY:
That's funny.
You didn't say
he was funny, Cassie.
- Dad.
- You didn't say I was...
- You didn't say I was funny?
- No.
I said you were boring but rich.
I am boring. Not that rich.
- (laughter)
- No? Well, in that case,
thanks for stopping by, kid.
(laughter)
What kind of doctoring
do you do?
Uh, pediatric, so...
children.
What was your, uh...
What was that doctor's name?
Cassie's doctor.
- Gary?
- Um, no.
Dr. Katzen-something.
CASSANDRA:
Yeah. Dad, he was like 80.
Yeah, well...
You-you don't know
Dr. Katzen...?
No.
SUSAN:
Now, I'm-I'm confused.
Are there different parts
of the body on a child?
No, it's pretty much
the same thing.
You're just...
You know, different-colored
Band-Aids and things.
It's not brain surgery.
(chuckles softly)
- Well...
- (laughs)
I get it. Yeah.
- Oh.
- (chuckles)
This sauce is
absolutely unbelievable.
(laughing quietly)
SUSAN:
Night, you two.
CASSANDRA:
Night.
Thanks for
introducing us to Ryan.
I know it was hard.
You know, your mom, she's...
(chuckles): Well, I mean,
we're both so glad that, uh...
Oh, my God, Dad.
(chuckles):
He's not that nice.
(laughs):
Yeah.
Yeah, I must be tired.
(sighs):
Okay.
Honey, Nina was like
a daughter to us.
You know that.
We really miss her.
(sighs)
But, God, we have missed you.
See you tomorrow.
(sighs, chuckles)
RYAN: Your mom...
oh, your mom is hot.
- Sorry.
- (laughing)
(chuckles):
Your mom is extremely hot.
Do you want her number?
- I could hook you up.
- Really?
Ooh.
I think she likes you
more than I do.
Well, I hope that's not true.
Can I... Mm.
Can I tell you something?
Sure.
I think you're amazing. I...
- Oh, no, Ryan.
- Just shut up, you stupid bitch.
- Please don't.
- Shh. I...
- Just take this, please.
- Mm-hmm.
I think you're incredible. I...
I'm... (sighs)
I'm-I'm... I think
I'm falling in love with you.
I think I'm falling
in love with you, too.
(softly):
Yes.
- Oh, my God.
- Don't make...
- Oh, my.
- Don't make a thing of it.
- I'm gonna buy you a bicycle.
- No.
- I want to buy you a bicycle.
- Ryan, be cool.
I'm cool.
- (whispers): I'm so cool.
- (laughing)
Oh, I'm the coolest.
(humming "Stars Are Blind")
Cassie.
Shit.
Madison,
what are you doing here?
Sorry. I, um...
I tried calling.
I left messages
about, uh, that guy.
Your friend.
Um, I don't know if-if your
phone number wasn't working.
Maybe I had an old one.
I just... I mean...
I know it seems kind of crazy,
me waiting on your porch
like some kind of stalker
or something.
Madison, I'm sorry.
I should've called you back.
Nothing happened with that guy.
Please believe me.
Are you sure? I...
But it seemed like...
I know what it seemed like,
but it wasn't.
He didn't touch you.
(sighs):
Oh, thank God.
(sobs):
Oh.
(sniffles)
Oh, I was...
I was so worried that, um...
that I... that he and I, um...
He just put you in bed.
Kept an eye on you
to make sure you were okay.
I'm really sorry
I didn't call you back.
It wasn't nice.
Yeah, well...
God. Look, there...
(sighs)
I need to show you something.
Okay.
Can we go inside?
Yeah.
Do you want a glass of water
or something?
No, thank you.
Oh.
After we had lunch and...
I got so drunk and woke up
in a hotel room with that guy,
um, I thought about it.
About what you said about Nina.
And how we all
just acted like...
And I remembered something.
What?
What?
There was a tape.
- What?
- A stupid video.
It just got sent around.
I got sent it.
Everyone did.
At the time, it was...
It was just gossip, you know?
Gossip?
So much stuff happened
back then, like, all the time.
You know what it was like.
It was just one blackout
after the next.
I-I hoped I'd imagined it.
But, um...
I always saved all my phones
for photos or whatever.
So, um...
Here.
I don't know how we all could
have watched it and, um...
What?
Thought it was funny.
You can have the phone, okay?
You don't have to watch it.
I really wouldn't watch it.
But, um, I don't know,
do whatever you want with it.
Just leave me out of it.
And...
please, will you do me a favor?
Yeah.
Never fucking contact me again.
