''Know then, your braves...''
''for you the feeble,
they fight...''
unto their deaths;
they lie hacked to pieces...
on the battle field
they never deserted
ls it the romance you yearn for?
Then come unto me...
come holding your head
upon your palm
Long live the Revolution
Bhagat Singh...
- Long live
Sukhdev...
- Long live
Rajguru...
- Long live
Open up
What is it?
- l'm Kishen Singh...
l'm Bhagat Singh's father.
Let me talk to the superintendent
He isn't in.
- Thejailer sahab?
Not in.
-All evening we've heard slogans...
being shouted inside the jail.
l want to know about our children
No one in
The Britishers have burnt some
corpses at the river side
''Will you tell me what's happening?
- Please, please... keep faith''
Will you please take a look?
- They killed Bhagat Singh
Lift the shroud
''We welcome Mahatma Gandhi to the
Karachi Session of Congress Party''
Long live...
- Mahatma Gandhi
Gandhi go back
Gandhi...
- Go back
''Come quickly, Bapu (Gandhi)
- Don't worry''
''Bapu, these people are trouble...
- Nothing will happen''
Mahatma Gandhi...
- Shame-shame
Calm down
This is a gift from us.
Take it!
''Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru
... you could've saved them!''
But you didn't!
- l would've gladly given up...
my own life to save them.
But the truth is...
they themselves didn't want to live.
- Lies! You are lying!
''Like the British government, you too
didn't want them to live''
That's why you didn't even try.
- l admired Bhagat Singh's courage
l salute his sacrifice
and applaud his patriotism
''But, l will never support violence.
Which was also why l didn't...''
favour their death sentences.
l tried my best to save them
Why should we believe you?
- history will never forgive you!
Come
Gandhi...
- Shame-shame!
Bhagat Singh...
- Lives forever!
Rajguru...
- Lives forever!
Sukhdev...
- Lives forever!
''Bhagat... Where are you?
Where are you, Bhagat?''
Come on! Run!
''Bhagat, where are...?.''
''Friends, today
is the Spring Festival''
We haven't gathered here
to make any trouble
''You heard? In Amritsar, General Dyer
opened fire inside Jallianwala Baug!''
Thousands dead...
''Friends, today
is the Spring Festival''
We haven't gathered here
to make any trouble
This meeting isn't meant
to challenge the law...
but to appeal to the government
to reconsider the curfew orders
Mother
''We will fight; of course we will.
Not violently, by non-violent means''
Our weapon will be a total
non-cooperation campaign
''Henceforth, no Indian will co-operate
with the British government''
Government employees
resign their jobs!
''Workers, walk out
of your factories!''
''Children, stop going
to government schools!''
Don't pay any tax!
Burn all your imported textiles!
Bring the entire machinery of
the British government to a halt!
''You do this, and l promise you
independence within one year''
''Mehta-ji, have you read today's paper?
- Yes, of course...''
British industrialists are panicking.
Their loaded ships are going back
A national boycott is very powerful!
- Of course!
The mightiest of empires get shaken.
Now let us see how long this...
''white government can possibly last.
- They'll never last, Father''
My son! Come here.
- Gandhi-ji says...
it's a matter of months now. No one
can stop our freedom now
Really?
- That's my tiger!
l heard you got into a brawl with
the police... Are you hurt?
Our days of being beaten are gone
Gandhi-ji's movement has made
life miserable for the British
''Come, come have some bread.
- Long live Gandhi-ji''
Long live Non Co-operation Movement!
''ln all of Lyallpur, your son is most
prominent in the movement''
He belongs to Gandhi-ji now.
Can't hear a word against him
''Tell me Aunty, what if
Uncle Ajit were to come back?''
Will such a day ever come to pass?
- It is coming. Really
''God Himself has come to us
as Gandhi. Get ready''
lndependence is coming. This year
Vande Mataram.
Mehta-ji...
tomorrow we take the procession
through the city square
Listen... l am scared
Scared? of what?
- Bhagat!
Bhagat...?
- Let's keep him with us please
Of course.
Who will take him away from us?
Don't you see?
How obsessed he is
with his country. At this age!
''The Motherland, Independence...''
''But after all that
we have seen, suffered...''
''Swaran, Ajit... Enough!''
''Not Bhagat now, not him, please''
Kishen Singh-ji...
terrible news!
Gandhi-ji has called-off
the Non Co-operation Movement
''What?!
- Yes, l just heard on the radio''
The police opened fire on a
peaceful procession at Chauri Chaura
''Some people died. Enraged, the public
set a police station on fire''
22 policemen were killed. That upset
Gandhi-ji and he withdrew the movement
Says that our country isn't yet
ready for independence
No...
''Let him go. At his tender age, it's
an unbearable blow. It'll take time''
Who was Mangal Pandey's father?
-What are you gaping at?
Didn't you hear what
Sukhdev-bhai asked? The name!
l don't know.
- Enroll this freedom fighter too
Your name?
-Atul Sachdev
Report to the canteen after college
''Hey Mr Society, tell me
Madan Mohan Malviya's full name''
''Tell us.
- Fool, l just told you his full name''
British Babu!
''Who took over from Robert Clive?
-Warren Hastings. October 20''
What a patriot! It's fellows like you
who'll bring in the revolution here
''Saw that, Bhagwati-bhai?
Knows their history in detail''
''Answers what l didn't even ask.
- Not his fault, Sukhdev''
''Colleges hammer in their history,
making us forget our own''
That's why l'm taking things
into my own hands. From today...
l'm going to teach these fellows.
Name?
Markand Trivedi.
- Report to the canteen after college
l can't come today.
-Why? Is it Robert Clive's birthday?
l'm participating in the show for
the Lieutenant Governor
Hadn't l forbidden everyone from
performing for those monkeys?
''Sukhdev-bhai, despite your warnings,
a show is being presented...''
by boys from our college.
-Who's doing it?
l don't know.
- Let me see how they do it
Organise lots of tomatoes and eggs.
- Done
Anyone know who this is?
- Yes...
''Thatall Sikh, who hardly speaks
to anyone, that bookworm...''
what's his name?
- You mean the boy from Lyallpur?
Bhagat Singh. That's his name.
- Bhagat Singh!
Never lose your dignity
''Jattt-men, treasure your turbans''
''The turban is your dignity,
preserve it''
''That dignity, never lose''
''Change your destiny,
break the shackles of slavery''
''Go for them
make their lives mis'erable''
''You will make the skies stoop,
if only you never lose courage''
''lf you desire,
you can bring the stars to Earth''
''Who can stopped Wind?
Who has witnessed Destiny?''
''By dint of your labours
even Destiny you will change''
''Never lose your dignity.
Jatt-men, treasure your turbans''
''Let's swear today, Jatt-men''
''Come, make a resolve
Iet's throw out the oppress'or''
''Steel your hearts,
steel your arms''
''Make life miserable
for these whites''
Never lose your dignity
''Jatt-men, treasure your turbans''
''Grab him! Lift, lift him!
That's it, Bhagat. Drop the fellow!''
Floor him!
Pin him down
Unfair. Your mother plies you
with butter
Shut up! Go get some yoghurt shake
''Read today's papers, Bhagat?
-Why?''
Lajpat Rai is supporting the
Hindu Council because...
the Congress has sidelined him.
- Tomorrow we'll see pamphlets...
exhorting Hindus to assert their
identity in the Independence struggle
Then Muslim leaders will react.
What kind of freedom can we hope for...
if we fight over religion and caste
perpetually?
Bloody white monkeys!
Give me that ball!
How many times have l told them
to not hit the ball over here
''l don't know about the country, but
this field will be liberated today''
They're determined to get thrashed
''And who're we to disappoint them?
Come on, brothers.''
Mules who believe in kicks
will never heed words
''With pleasure, white monkey''
''Ghosts of kicks
do not understand words''
Number two on the left is mine.
- Mr Longface is mine
l want that effeminate one.
- l'm cracking the capless one's head
''Hey, how about just a token knock?''
The might of our resolve and the
sight of our maces did it!
The day the whole country stands up...
together they're going to back off
just like this
Bhagwati-bhai! l've come!
- This is the advantage of marriage
''No matter where you are,
your food will reach you in time!''
''Does she ever send it for me alone, eh?
Now don't you dare touch the cans''
Sister-in-law Durga has sent food
Glory to our sister-in-law Durga
''Khairu,join us.
- Not today''
Fo rthe first time l'm taking
my wife and my sister to the cinema
The HRA pamphlet.
Hindustan Republican Association
Mr Sanyal has drafted it.
All the revolutionaries are involved
The goal is... Independent India.
- Great!
''First Home Rule Society, then
Gadar Party. Now another one... HRRA''
They can't achieve anything.
- So who will?
''Bhagat, whether you accept it or not,
the Congress has survived for 30 years''
Because survival is their sole aim.
- They also want to work
Forget the Non Co-operation...
-Why? Let's talk of that
''That'll be problematic, since
you'll bring up Chauri-Chaura''
And why not? Didn't it happen?
- Yes... but...
''But, why did the mob have to burn
down the police station?''
''l suppose they should've
saluted and moved on, right?''
Lapping up Congress propaganda!
Bloody civil servant
''Look Sukhdev, everyone has
a right to his opinion''
l'm telling you there's something
about this Gandhi guy
Sure there is. One who can draw
12-year olds into the streets...
must have something about him
''Gandhi-ji says ''No white education''
Children throw their books
into the gutters...
burn their books and pencils.
Ready for action
Little boys... distributing pamphlets...
carrying placards
And suddenly one day
the movement's off. That's it
Government schools... closed to them.
Government colleges refuse admission
Where do you go? What do you do?
Don't you remember?
Had Lala Lajpat Rai not set up
the National College...
we would've been on the streets
Not me! l can still hire
10 servants from here
''Let go, Bhagwati-bhai!
You'll remember the sepoys...''
''killed in Chauri Chaura; but, not
who they first killed?''
The Jallianwala massacre won't haunt
you since you knew no one there!
Sukhdev... Professor Vidyalankar
''Were it not for Bhagwati-bhai,
l would've broken his skull''
Khairu...? What happened?
-At the theatre...
he blundered into the A Class.
Some Britishers mauled him up
Those same cricket fellows
Which way did the boys go?
Do you know what would've happened
if you were caught?
''Got beaten up,jailed...?
- But even so we'd be satisfied''
At least we did something.
- Do you really believe that...
your thrashing will
make them mend their ways?
''lf they won't, we'll do it again.
-And that'll drive them out, yes?''
So fine then. We won't do anything.
-We'll watch passively
Who's asking you to be passive?
It is essential to rebel
But there's a method to it.
- Non violence?
Gandhi isn't the only alternative.
The masses have enough power...
to up root the mightiest regime.
Organise them
Like the Bolsheviks did in Russia
lt can be done here too
There's a party here tying that
''They believe in direct action.
-Who, Sir?''
You mentioned it in the canteen
HRRA...?
- Hindustan Republican Association
Would you like to join?
- Certainly sir
Think it over. The path is dangerous.
For the revolution...
''it's only his ideal, his party
that matters to him''
''For him there's no comfort, no rest...
- No joys, no love, no family, nothing''
We're ready to make
every sacrifice
Celebration in your house?
- l'm wondering too...
Congratulations!
-What for...?
What's going on?
''You're late, brother...''
''Who are they?
- Guests, from Manawale''
Father has invited them for lunch.
The alliance is to be finalised
''Alliance?
- Yes, Teja Singh is here''
With his family. My future
sister-in-law is here too
Oye sister-in-law...?
''Son, hurry up. Dress up
and come here''
Yes Babu-ji
Ma...
- This is my son
''Pay your respects, son''
''Bless you, son.
Heard so much about you''
We're proud to have
you as our son-in-law
Saw him?
What are you up to?
- Getting you married!
Your father has arranged
a match for you
Without asking me?
- Had my father asked me?
But Ma...
- No buts
Did we ever interfere in your life?
Even when you became an atheist?
Now go and get dressed.
- You... l can't...
''Go, go''
He's getting married?
- Forget the wedding. Tuck in
''Gentlemen, get this clear.
If Bhagat refuses to mary...''
l'm going to beat
the two of you up like mules
What will l beat you like?
- Mules
Enjoy the sweets
Sat Sri Akal
- Sat Sri Akal (greetings)
Listen...
l... l can't get married
l've some compulsions
You love someone else.
- No! It's not that
''Something wrong with me?
- No, no, please...''
''You're... beautiful, virtuous.
It'll be a lucky man who marries you''
''Then why are you refusing?
- l... see, l've chosen a path...''
that's very difficult.
- l'll walk behind you
lt'll be a world of sorrow.
- l shall bear it
But l cannot take you along.
- Then l shall await your return
What if l never return?
''Dear Father
You will remember that...''
''at my initiation ceremony,
grandfather dedicated me...''
''to the cause of our country. It is
my good fortune to fulfill that''
''Nothing holds any meaning for me,
except the struggle for freedom''
''Therefore l am setting myself
upon that path''
l hope you will forgive me
This way...
Many uniforms around...
- The bigger menace are spies
''This is Cawnpore, brother.
The revolutionary capital of India''
Here revolutionaries and policemen
play hide-and-seek
Meston Road
When is the meeting with Mr Bismil?
- 8 o'clock. We'll be on time
''So it's decided. After Kakori
we halt the train and...''
''raid the treasury chest.
- Forgive me, but there'll be...''
armed police. It's risky
''For HRRA, everything is risky.
- Don't we need money for...''
''campaigning, arms?
- But, Khan sahab, why not raid...''
''a merchant or a landlord, as usual?
- No!''
Such acts alienate us from our own
countrymen
Hence we target government wealth
lt's ours anyway. The British loot
it from our country
''Well said, Roshan Singh''
We're on time
''Doubts, questions?.''
''Comrades, the desire for sacrifice
now rules our hearts''
lt is time to test the power
of the enemy's blade
Hello Bhagat Singh
l'm Ram Prasad Bismil. l read
Professor Vidyalankar's letter
Why do you wish to join our party?
- For the reason that you founded it
State your reason.
- Same as everyone's...
Freedom.
- How do we win it?
By fighting for it
Does thrashing a few boys
in the dark constitute fighting?
That was a beginning.
- Fighting began 15O years ago
So where's the freedom?
- Maybe the method was flawed
''history says, revolution succeeds only
if the masses are involved...''
''Now l see. You read a few books and
want to play ''revolution-revolution''
''A rich bored lad is out for some
adventure, is it?''
When the police whip-lash your naked
body on a slab of ice...
all your fire will be quickly doused
''Go home, son''
This struggle demands blood
''Spilling blood is no big deal Sir,
be it one's own or another's''
But will that blood
arouse future generations?
That's my dream
''Kartar Singh, the martyr is my ideal''
''Moreover, what l've seen around me
has made me completely immune...''
to ice and whips
We shall have lots to talk about
when l return
''Bhagat Singh, our new comrade!''
Don't move!
Hands up!
Bandits!
Roshan Singh!
Hello Bismil-ji...
''All of them have been captured.
- Except Pandit-ji, as usual''
But the police is after him
They might discover our hideout too
''We must remove documents, arms...''
That might be dangerous.
- The police may be watching
l'll go first
Who are you?
-Who are you?
Tell me who you are.
- Identify yourself now
Tell me or else...
- Pandit-ji!
''He's our new comrade, Bhagat Singh.
- This is Chandra shekhar Azad!''
You should've told me your name.
l might've killed you
Party rules don't allow you to
reveal your identity to a stranger
Mr Bismil praised you highly.
Now l know why
Pandit-ji... is it true?
- Has everyone been caught?
''Yes, it's all over.
The labour of years...''
A well-knit group...
destroyed in one stroke
''Now there will be life-sentences
hangings... So much was to be done'...''
''The party's finished.
- Nothing is finished, Pandit-ji!''
''They can imprison our bodies,
not our cause''
''The enemy can kill people,
not their ideals''
''And as long as our ideals live,
the party lives''
We shall nourish these ideals
with our blood
Our goal is revolution. Let us take
the revolution to the masses...
whatever the price
''My land, my life''
''My country, my pride''
lndestructible
Unfearing
''For my Motherland
l'm not afraid to die''
l am unconquerable
''ln the fires in our eyes
we can see a thousand Edens''
''The road to freedom we tread
carrying our shrouds''
We walk with our shrouds
Those who live in cross hairs...
aren't afraid of guns
''My land, my life''
''My country, my pride''
''lf you fight among yourselves,
how will you fight the British?''
Embrace!
Long live
- Hindu-Muslim brotherhood!
We are one!
- Long live our brotherhood!
He has many aliases...
but his real name is Bhagat Singh
''He writes articles on revolutionaries
distributes pamphlets...''
''Mainly lectures on Hindu-Muslim unity,
gets them together for... ''
Do you know the punishment
for bombing a crowd?
There's still time... confess
and your sentence could be light
You people did this to implicate me
Because you are scared...
as you ought to be
The masses are awakening.
Tell these British to run away now...
or they will be kicked out
l won't stop now. l'll whip you
all your life
''Your bail amount is 60,OOO Rupees!''
You can't raise that amount. Ever!
Sir...
-What is it?
His father has come with his bail.
-What...?!
''Don't be so disheartened, Officer''
''We shall meet again.
You see, even l won't stop now''
Mother...
Brother is back...
My Bhagat is back! He's come...
He's here...
How are you?
-very well
And school?
- Fine
Brother...
- How are you?
''Live long...
- Bless you, my dear one''
Oh what have these tormentors done
to you? Didn't they feed you?
''They did, Ma.
- Did they beat you?''
Why? Am l a thief?
- Then why did they keep you?
They liked my jokes.
Like you do
But unlike you they didn't
Iaugh with false teeth
False teeth?! Get me a sugarcane.
l'll bite into it in front of you
''Live long, son. Been so long since
we heard laughter in this house''
Please never leave us again.
- Of course he won't
''To recover the 60,OOO Rupees, he has
to work at our dairy. Yes, Bhagat?''
''l heard you, l heard you, Father''
''lt's nothing, Ma.
- l'm not letting you go anywhere''
You lied to me!
You can't be away
from me now
''l'm not, you're always in my...
- l know you're great with words''
''Don't ever leave me again.
Work at the dairy, okay?''
Okay! Now give me
my yoghurt shake
Why can't you simply distribute
the pamphlets? Even yesterday...
''l tried, Bhagat. But the constable
is very clever''
l'll divert their attentions. Tonight
we'll release their buffaloes
While they go on a buffalo-hunt...
- The pamphlets will be distributed
Get the magic lantern ready too
Any additions to Pandit-ji's lettter?
''Tell him, code now is Charlie Chaplin''
Damn. Jaidev's down again
Look at how much milk you've spilt.
- Father will think we drank it up
To hell with your milk.
My girl thinks that...
l'm a revolutionary who gets
beaten up by the police
''lf she knew l'm getting kicked
by buffaloes, she'll kick me out''
Girls!
-Where...?
Ms Manawale!
-Who's Manawale?
Bhagat's bride to-be.
-Which one?
The one that's refusing
to look here
''I say, ma'am, Sat Sri AkaI!.''
Sat Sri Akal
Come on...
We came to the fair. Felt thirsty...
- That's great
Bhagat's dairy is your dairy.
Have some great milk
''Come please, ladies... please...''
Make yourselves comfortable
- She's eager to meet you.
Greet her at least...
Come ladies... Milk? Butter?
You're suave...
more sweet than sugar...
''more exciting than
the most exotic...''
your words are to me
My love...
''May the colours of the henna
never fade from my hands''
''Day and night
l have pined for you''
My love...
''in every heart..beat,
you are...
''in every breath
l chant your name...''
my love
''The vermilion on my forehead
beckons you every moment''
''My bangles chime in anticipation
of your touch''
''Your path veers
away from mine...''
never to meet
You do not know...
how tortuous my journey is
No one from Bengal?
- They don't concur with our views
''But, this meeting's been called
for us to understand one another''
''Be joy, we have to work unitedly now.
- l tried my best to convince...''
Sardar Bhagat Singh himself!
Escaped so soon from the dairy?
''Been a long year, Sukhdev.
-And had his lawyer's cleverness...''
''not resolved the case, it would've
cost a lifetime to earn 60,OOO Rupees!''
Bathing buffaloes...
- Is the new revolution!
But my mother would've been happy.
-And the lady from Manawale...?
No Sardar! Please! That's my weak arm.
- Deserves to be broken
Let go... someone's knocking
''Yashpal, l told you to get sweets,
what's this?''
He was spying.
- Says Pandit-ji sent him
Didn't know the code.
So we grabbed him
Release him
Sit still!
BLOODY HELL!
Bloody hell...
Who are you?
- Chandrashekhar Azad-ji told me...
to reach Mozang House.
l was just inquiring when...
You've reached.
-Where...?
''This is Mozang House, idiot''
What's the code?
- Er... code... l... forgot...
Name?
-Who's name?
Yours!
- My name... sure...
Err... Hari... Shivram... Rajguru
No wait... It's Shivram Hari Rajguru...
err... something like that
State your business.
- Name again...?
''Why are you here, idiot?
- Look...''
l'm a new member of your group. HRRA.
Azad-ji has sent this letter...
for Bhagat Singh.
Who is Bhagat Singh?
Give it here.
- No! It's for Bhagat Singh
''Give me the letter, son of Chaplin!
- Chaplin...?''
Charlie Chaplin
... that's the code!
Thank you
l'm Bhagat Singh.
-Wow!
Delighted to meet you.
Pandit-ji speaks so highly of you
l hear you have called
a big meeting...
where revolutionaries from all
over India will come together
''l'm from Maratha land, brave
like the great warrior, Shivaji!''
''An expert shooter too. Fearless.
Ah today, l slipped up a bit''
But you'll see... l'll live with you
and die with you...
For the party's aim.
- Do you know the aim of our party?
Freedom!
Freedom isn't our aim!
''What are you saying, Bhagat?
-What is this freedom?''
A transfer of power
from the British...
to a handful of rich and
powerful Indians?
Will that make any difference
to the life of a common man?
To the labourer...
to the poor man?
Will this freedom give them
their rights? No!
''Comrades, freedom is just the first
step. The aim is to build a nation''
A nation which guarantees equal
rights to all in society
A society that doesn't discriminate
on grounds of religion
A nation that does not tolerate
the exploitation of man by man
''Too idealistic, Bhagat''
''very difficult.
- Difficult, Fani-da. Not impossible''
lt isn't easy to keep united
a country that has so many...
''religions, castes,
cultures, languages''
''Unless we understand this task now
unless we struggle for it now...''
''lndia will still get freedom.
But, it will degenerate...''
''into a corrupt, exploitative
and communalised society''
''Comrades, our aim is a
a socialist society''
Our party's name must clearly
reflect that
l'm proposing that the
Hindustan Republican Association...
be renamed as Hindustan Socialist
Republican Association!
Are you with me?
- Yes... Yes...
''Then comrades, from today...''
let us declare a war
on British rule!
Our first target:
Drive back the Simon Commission
We shall fight beside
Lala Lajpat Rai
To the Hindustan Socialist
Republican Association...
Victory!
Lala-ji's murder is a bloody slap
on the face of the nation!
Two 22-year old policemen batter
him to death in public...
No one even protests?
-Who says? Congress condemns it
The Hindu Council denounces...
- Nonsense! Nonsense!
The ugly fact is that all have
become eunuchs
This helplessness is everywhere
We will have to answer this.
Scott has to be killed
Absolutely! It's the only way to
teach the government a lesson
We must strike terror in their hearts.
- Our action will do so
They will think ten times before
repeating such an act
But... murder...?
''See, Jaigopal...
we cherish human life''
We'd sooner die than
kill an innocent man
But this policeman is not innocent.
His actions reflect the cruelty and...
''in humanity of the power behind him.
By hitting him, we attack that power''
Great! l'll barge into the police
station and blast him right now
''For the hottest of actions
you need a cool head''
Volunteers?
Think it over.
Being caught means the noose
''Since, l'll participate...
Sukhdev will plan''
The map. Police headquarters
and adjoining areas
Bhagat Singh and Rajguru will fire.
Bhagat first
''Pandit-ji, you will cover them.
Jaigopal, keep an eye on Scott''
Your job is to identify him
on that day
Day of action: 1l December
''Not Scott
he's Saunder's''
Stop!
Turn back!
l don't want to kill an Indian
Go!
ls it true...
was one attacker a Sikh?
The police have cordoned off
the town. How will he get out?
Watch every face.
You've seen the assassins
They mustn't escape.
- No one can evade your eyes
Your fortunes are about to turn
Nab anyone even
slightly suspicious
Oh my baby!
''Watch out for disguises. They might
have false beards, shaved mustaches''
Let's go back.
- Come on. Move
''Sorry.
Get up, scum!.''
''Forgive him, he's poor.
- l never wanted to return from London''
But you insisted on seeing
your relatives
Look the kind of people living here.
You need officers like him
For 150 years they caned you.
But you never improved
This one did. Became a policeman!
''Get back, make way for the gentleman!''
What are you staring at?
Look over there
Let's see how those killers
get out of Lahore
''You're right, Bhagat. Hardly any one
here knows of our party''
''And no one knows of its principles
or aims, at all''
''lf it's like this in Calcutta
what about the rest of the country?''
But why? Didn't we risk our lives
to avenge Lala-ji's murder...
because it was the wish
of the people
''Bhabhi, who knows that?
Four posters in Lahore...''
a few articles
in Lucknow and Cawnpore...
don't cover the country
''People do not know our ideology,
that we speak for them''
''ln their eyes, we're what the British
have labelled us. Terrorists''
Even Congress leaders call us that
And what's published about us
forms public opinion
Face it... we're isolated from
the people
The revolution we dream of can never
be fulfilled until...
the common people are with us
''You're right, Bhagat. We may die
or kill for the country''
''But no one will know. And they?
Even if they sneeze, the nation hears''
''But, we too will do that
which will echo throughout the country''
We'll explode bombs
There's a professor here who
knows how to make bombs
Jatin Das
Ah! Great fellow. He can teach us
He'll never teach us bomb-making.
He's anathemic to any violence
''He did refuse. But, if Bhagat speaks,
he may agree''
No way. l'm not with you people.
Do you know where you will end up?
Life imprisonment or gallows!
''That is if we get caught.
As long as l have this, no one...''
''can catch me alive. l'm Azad, free.
And will always be free''
Those who worry about consequences
can never fight for the country!
''Okay, okay...
But, why bombs and guns at all?''
Why can't we join the Congress
in this struggle?
''Yes, Congress is struggling alright''
We just heard Gandhi-ji
ask for Dominion status
Dominion status! Half-rule!
''We get the throne,
they keep the reins''
''Begin every assembly session
with, ''God save the King''!''
ls that what you want?
''For every policy decision,
seek British approval!''
That'll be freedom.
You know this
''That may be so, but the
people are with the Congress''
''The Congress only wants power,
by hook or by crook''
They aren't even thinking about
what this country really needs
''With their way, nothing will change''
''The rich will get richer,
the poor will become poorer''
And a time will come when this
country will get devoured by...
communal passions.
That is the nightmare of the future
Even then l cannot favour violence!
''Violence is when you use force
to exploit people, to oppress them''
''The fight for one's life, for
dignity, for rights...''
is not violence.
It is self-defence!
l will not call your act violence.
It is self defence
That's what l've been saying
Okay. Take me to my death!
''Say that sweetly, brother...
- Indeed! This man pulls a gun on me''
''You try to strangle me!
- Okay, okay. Order some sweets now''
''For 45 days,
we've been on strike!.''
''We ask for basic things...
food, education for our children...''
''But, our employer gives us
a lecture on freedom''
What freedom?
Will it improve our lot?
No!
You are right. Even today...
he has come with the police...
to take his goods
from the go down
We will give up our lives
but won't let them do this
''We won't, we won't.
-We shall fight for the revolution!''
Workers stop work only when their
suffering becomes unbearable
''ln the last year itself, there were
200 strikes, in this country''
''And yet, no one is doing anything.
Instead, the government has drafted...''
the Trade Disputes Bill
and Public Safety Bill...
to declare all strikes illegal
''Any protestor can be locked up...
without evidence, without trial''
''What're you proposing, Bhagat?
- On April 8''
The Viceroy will force
both the bills through the Assembly
We will oppose that.
By exploding a bomb there
Silence
''But Bhagat, there'll be Indians
in that session too''
The purpose of the bomb will not
be to cause any injury or death
Then why throw a bomb?
- Because the whites are deaf
And it takes a loud sound to make
the deaf hear
lt'll be a warning for them:
Enough is enough!
Brilliant Bhagat! Brilliant!
''This explosion will shake up England.
And, in the pandemonium...''
our bomb-throwers
will escape easily
''No, Panditji. This time there'll be
no running away. They will court arrest''
A revolutionary never surrenders.
He fights all the way
So shall we. We have been called
irresponsible... terrorists...
''By not running away, we will show
that our actions are deliberate...''
That we take responsibility for them.
This act will put us in the public eye
''The masses will get to know us.
And, during the court case...''
our statements will be recorded.
Newspapers will be forced to publish...
''our reasons, our arguments. The means
that we've been looking for...''
''to reach the people, the government
itself will gift that to us''
''We will use their platform, their
channel to reach out to people''
''We need two men. One of them...
-Will not be you, Bhagat!''
''Pandit-ji! l have to go. l've
worked out what to say, how to...''
Sure. Instruct the comrades;
they will do it
Why not l...?
The Saunders murder case can be
re-opened. l don't want to risk your...
''Pandit-ji, no one can do this
better than me!''
l will decide that. l will choose
the boys for this mission
''Please Pundit-ji...
- That's my order, Bhagat''
l am the commander-in-chief of HSRRA!
''Sukhdev, you don't understand.
l tried my best, but he wouldn't...''
And you gave up?
''To fight in a British court
requires language, Bhagat...''
''An impeccable understanding of
history, politics...''
''Wit, presence of mind, and the
nerve to take on the best of them!''
And the man who can do it all
will not be there!
''He'll write articles, draft proposals
while others go to their death''
Sukhdev!
''Suddenly discovered a desire
for life, Sardar Bhagat Singh?''
''l discarded that desire as soon
as l became conscious, Sukhdev''
And you're accusing me of cowardice?
- l am not. As your friend...
l remind you of your duty. You know
that no can do this better than you
Then why?
Why is someone else going?
''Fine. If you are determined
to disobey me, then why ask?''
lt's not that. If anyone here can
say that he can do this better...
l'll withdraw voluntarily
lt's the HSRRA principle:
Choose the best man for the job
But the Saunders murder case...
- Pandit-ji...
All of us risk our lives. We can't
Iet the mission suffer for that
Very well. Who accompanies you?
- l shall
''No, Sukhdev. After me
Sukhdev will take my place h' ere''
lt'll be at two-pronged battle.
We'll do our propaganda from inside
Outside you'll organise the masses.
- l will accompany Bhagat
Do you know English? Sit down.
- l'll learn everything by rote
Why is he so eager to die?
-Just once...
let me die for my country.
Then l'll live in peace forever
Wonderful!
- You've all gone crazy!
Yes Bhagat?
- Batukeshwar Dutt will be with me
''Me...? Thank you, Bhagat...''
''Respected Father, l don't know
whether l will see you again''
''l have reached that stage of
my journey, where l am...''
''no longer a son, a brother,
a friend''
''l am only a revolutionary
whose only aim is...''
''freedom for his country.
l am sure l have your blessings''
''Yours, Bhagat''
''Nay, Nay...''
''lnquilab Zindabad,
Down with Imperialism''
Irresponsible young men! They have
maligned the freedom struggle
Regrettable! Freedom is
even more difficult now
This cannot be condemned enough
The youth of this country will have
to choose their path...
Mahatma Gandhi's?
Or this Bhagat Singh's?
Long live Revolution!
Down with Imperialism
My clients want to tell the court
their reason for throwing the bomb
Have you ever sentenced
anyone to death?
''lf your motive is ignored, you become
just a common murderer''
''Great going, Bhagat!
Well spoken''
Justice can never be done without
knowing the motive behind the crime
May l...?
''We know how to make bombs
so we understand their power''
We didn't include
chemicals or shrapnel in them
We threw them in a safe area. Because
we value and respect human life
Our motive was not to kill.
it was to make ourselves heard
it takes a loud sound to make
the deaf hear
Hence the bombs were thrown.
They were a warning...
to the British:
Your time here is over
To our Assembly members:
Stop betraying your people
''Our country's real strength comes
from our farmers, our labourers''
''But, not only are they
cruelly exploited...''
their right to protest
was being quashed...
By the Trade Disputes
and Public Safety Bills
lt was our duty to highlight
their conditions
Hence the bombs were thrown
We want our youth to
determine their own future
Learn to ask questions. Following
someone blindly is also slavery
''And finally, let our great leaders
stop preaching to the people''
''lnstead, listen to them''
Criticising Gandhi-ji
has become fashionable
My child...
forget him
Can you?
l am his mother
And l...?
Do only ties of blood matter
... not ties of the heart?
''Kishori, what are you up to?
All the explosives are lying here?''
Hide them
''Sukhdev-bhai, Azad-ji's letter''
Police!
Run!
Don't hit me...
Ushering in a revolution?
- Yes
Making bombs?
- Yes
Who are your accomplices?
Names!
Name your accomplices!
You must be tired;
ask another slave to help you
We were keeping the movement going.
- It happened so suddenly
We never had a chance.
- The police raided us so suddenly
''Don't lose heart.
We're still together, aren't we?''
United.
We'll continue the struggle
But why have they called us here?
l hear the Saunders case
has been reopened
On what basis?
-What evidence can they have?
Kishorilal
Ajoy Ghosh
Shiv Verma
Gaya Prasad
Jaidev Kapoor
Batukeshwar Dutt
Bhagat Singh
And me?
l am Sukhdev!
identify me!
''Meet my eyes, you bastard!
Remember how l fed you?''
''You bastard, how could you
do this to us?''
How could you?
''Let go of me, Bhagat''
''lt's all over, Bhagat...''
lt's all over
When our own friends
have betrayed us...
who will believe in us?
Come on move!
Move ahead!
Hey freedom fighter!
Take your lunch. Fast!
l'm not eating this.
-Why?
Look at the way food is...
- This is how it is
And this is what everyone eats.
- l won't
Why won't you eat?
Because this food
isn't fit for humans
What are you tying to say?
- Those white prisoners...
''are given every facility,
but we're treated worse than animals''
Dirty filthy clothes...
rats and cockroaches on the food...
''Feed us simple stuff,
but keep it clean at least...''
This is what you will get.
That's it!
Then l won't eat
Until we're treated
like human beings
''Decent food, clean clothes
books to read, newspapers''
You'll get nothing!
Then l won't eat.
- For how long?
Until you agree to my demands.
-We'll see
Sure.
- Really?
''Bhagat, eat''
You haven't eaten
for so many days
''For God's sake
don't refuse...''
''Thank you, Sir, but l can't.
- l got it made at home''
''You wanted good food,
didn't you?''
lt isn't just about food and
clothes. Nor is it about me alone
The government must agree to..
- The government won't give anything
''Then l'll die of starvation, l guess.
- They won't let you die either''
Batukeshwar Duttoo
is on hunger strike
News of your hunger-strike is already
in the papers. You've no idea...
what they can do to
break your spirit
''l'll know soon, l suppose''
''Won't eat, wiII you?.
Let's see...''
Open his mouth!
Shove it in!
lt's just been 15 days.
Know this well...
l will do whatever it takes
to break your hunger strike
Get me? Give me an answer!
-What about our demands?
Nothing! Your demands
will never be met. Never!
''Understand this, Bhagat.
Your hunger strike makes no difference''
Why are you doing this?
- Because l can't tolerate injustice
''And l can't tolerate disobedience.
-very well, Jailer''
You be loyal to your job.
l'll be loyal to my country
What is this madness?
Why are you doing this?
B.K... didn't you stop him?
You've joined him too?
Why aren't you eating?
What will we achieve?
Long Live Bhagat Singh!
''Bhagat Singh, keep going!
We are with you!''
lnquilab...
-Zindabad!
Long live the revolution!
''The desire for sacrifice
now burns inside our hearts''
''The time has come to test the
strength of the enemy's blade''
''Do you see the writing
in the skies?''
Our resolve weakens the enemy
The spirit of sacrifice
''ln our blood
we will etch our history''
''From the tyrants we shall redeem
our land, our skies''
''lmbued with the spirit of Sacrifice,
fear not even Death''
''You are young and your Motherland
is threatened''
Should you stand mute witness?
''Witness, every heart craves
to perform the ultimate sacrifice''
''The desire for sacrifice now
rules our hearts''
''lt is time to test the strength
of the enemy's blade''
''Hey, Rajguru!
- l won't leave you fellows alone''
''Brave like
the great warrior, Shivaji!''
Put him in the dock
with the others
''l thank you,
o'Government lap-dog!''
Oye Sukhdev...
l missed you boys..
lt's a celebration!
The celebration of the revolution!
Do you even know the meaning
of revolution?
Revolution is a war
against tyranny and injustice!
lt is a weapon
to fight exploitation!
A call to the youth
to unite!
A warning to this
barbaric government!
Awake-up call for
the passive masses!
A cry to arouse your
buried conscience!
Thank you for the explanation.
- So come join the celebration!
The prosecution wishes to present
a government witness
Granted
Mr Phonindranath Ghosh
to be presented
Did the accused set up
an illegal bomb-factoy?
Yes
''Hey, Iook me in the eye, coward!.''
''Blushing like a bride, are you?''
''Are they sending you
to Britain, traitor?''
Dog!
Were you part of the bomb-making?
Yes
We have already submitted his
written testimony...
His testimony is false!
He isn't one of us
He knows nothing about making bombs.
-What?
Don't l know how to make bombs?
Jatin-da.
Tell them that l do know
''No, you don't''
''He doesn't, your honour.
-What are you saying?''
''lf you do, tell us what ingredients
are used to make bombs''
l'll tell you...
Mainly nine...
- Tell us
''Yes, go on''
Gun cotton
Gauze wire
Ammonium carbonate
Sulphur
Red phosphorus
Red sulphide
Carbolic acid
Nitric acid
Sulphuric acid
That's all.
-Are you sure?
''Yes... no, wait two more.
Red paper...''
''for capping the bomb,
and iron pieces for the clip''
''That's it. Well Jatin-da
what do you say?''
What're you laughing at?
want to test him further?
Enough.
-We have nothing more to ask
lt took us years to learn; now every
child will read it in the newspapers
The recipe of making bombs!
Wonderful!
- Now every kid can make bombs
We hear that all comrades are now
being kept together in the same jail
Bad times for the British!
Run!
''Boys, what's going on?
Come on, eat your lunch''
''Come to eat, man''
''Bhagat, you tell them''
''Go on, eat''
''No Bhagat, no one will eat.
- l'm not eating''
Nor l.
- Not me
We're in this together!
''Look, this... isn't easy.
Once you begin a strike...''
you go all the way. Breaking it is
our defeat. If even one of you...
''No one's going give up.
We're with you, all the way''
Not one of us will weaken.
-We're going to fight all the way
''You will die one inch at a time
every single day...''
Long Live Revolution!
Today the Bengal Tiger
really struck firm
Jatin-da thrashed them.
A guard is still clutching his groin
Wonderful!
Didn't let one drop go in!
l had told you... all the way
Water!
Water!
Scoundrels! All night they
kept us without water
Can someone hear?
Water!
''At least bring our water,
you bastards!''
''This crazy Kishori, swallowed
chilli-powder to inflame his throat''
To stop them from inserting tubes.
His throat's been on fire since
''Give me water, please...''
Were you born of beasts?
Look at these rascals! They've
given us milk instead of water
''The desire for sacrifice
now rules our hearts''
''lt is time to test the power
of the enemy's blade''
''Come the time, we'll leave
for all the world to see...''
''what joy there is
in obsession...''
in pursuit of the goal
lt's the flame of sacrifice
''As we hang to
the last threads of hope...''
''tying to hold on to
a dream we dreamt together''
What resolve can torture break?
''The flame of sacrifice
burns inside our hearts''
''Now put to test the strength
of the enemy blade''
''Like the fragrance
of the grain...''
''we will live in every crop
our farmers raise''
Like the humming of life...
''we will live on the breaths
of every generation to come''
For generations to come
''The flame of sacrifice
burns inside our hearts''
''Now put to test the strength
of the enemy blade''
''Come the time, we'll leave
for all the world to see...''
''what joy there is
in obsession...''
in pursuit of the goal
Eat a sweet!
The whites are defeated!
They broke before
our children's resolve!
No food for 63 days...
refuses to take medicine...
''lf he won't listen, l can't help it.
Someone please tell him''
Jatin-da... brother...
We won...
They agreed to our demands
''Take the medicine, please...
- Bhagat, l promised you...''
Not a drop... today too...
With you all the way... all the way...
Swear o'country men...
never to grieve
''Celebrate this freedom
do not weep for me''
We were unafraid...
''of even looking
Death in the eye''
To my Motherland...
my life
My country...
my pride
Jatin-da...
- Lives forever
''Even l mourn the death of this boy.
But, l regret to say that if we...''
''followed their path, we can't create
a society. It'll cause destruction''
Destruction is hardly our aim.
Our aim is to free India
From these alien plunderers. We're
prepared to shed our blood for it
Non-violence and love are the only
two ways to attain freedom. Because...
with them we can win the hearts
hearts of our enemy
ln all these years
of love and non-violence...
the hearts of how many General Dyers
and Lord lrwins have we won?
We are ready for a dialogue
with the British
''There can be no dialogue, no pact
between a slave and a master''
The British must quit India first;
then we'll negotiate with them
''We have demanded Dominion Status
and we shall have it''
Total independence! It's our right
and we shall seize it
Long Live Revolution!
You actually endorsed his views?
''And, in the Congress Bulletin?
- l... l wanted a debate on it...''
Debate? Congress principles are
fundamentally opposed to his
l'm... sorry.
But l must point out that...
the youth of our party now speak
Bhagat Singh's language
Here we wait for the Viceroy's reply
to our appeal for Dominion Status...
''and there, our youth echoes
Bhagat Singh's slogan...''
of Total Independence
- Total Independence...?
Let the British government
get this loud and clear
Congress will not make any compromise
on its demand for Total Independence!
''So, as per the Viceroy's
new ordinance the case...''
can proceed even in the
absence of the accused
The verdict is pre-determined.
-And no appeal is permitted either
''So, now the British government will
commit murder in broad daylight''
''But, that was exactly Bhagat's aim.
To provoke the government into...''
revealing its true barbaric nature.
It's done that. They stand exposed
''Hence, they want to finish him off!
-We can't lose Bhagat. We won't''
Send word to him to be ready. We'll
spring him on the way to court
He has accomplished his mission
''No Sinha, l haven't accomplished
even a thousandth of what l want to''
''Tell Pandit-ji, the war continues.
And l can't flee now''
Do you realise where this is headed?
To the gallows!
What will you achieve by dying?
- Do you know what l really dream of?
l dream of a smiling death. l dream
of my death inspiring...
the youth of this country to plunge
into the battle for freedom...
without fear
''You know, if that happens...
then our dream...''
''of a great nation, of an equal society
free from exploitation...''
a secular country...
where Hindus and Muslims don't kill
each other over temples and mosques...
where every religion and sect
happily co-exist...
that dream of a genuinely
secular society...
will come true!
Then India will be great!
''Before your ancestors had a language,
our children were reading scriptures''
Hear hear!
The fame of our golden land dragged
you all the way from England
''Under the guise of trade,
the English came here to plunder us''
And you call us poor?
Have you no shame?
''Bloody hell, even your queen wears
the Kohinoor diamond stolen from us''
What's with this order-order?
Do you think 3 judges
instead of one scare us?
Bring on another 300 if you will.
We speak the truth and you will hear us
What are you people
so proud of anyway?
Because you use spoons and forks
instead of your hands?
Or because you use paper
instead of water?
''Get out while
you still can, fellows!''
lf our 300 million Indians
were to just shout in unison...
You hundred thousand Britishers
will be running away deaf
The traitor.
- Forget him. Where're our sweets?
Must've blocked them at the door.
- Those policemen will gobble them up
''Mr Ram Saran Das, in your deposition...
- It's a lie!''
All lies! The police beat me up...
Forced me to sign the testimony
No! We won't allow that now!
He's a liar!
''Clearly, how witnesses are being
coerced by police beatings''
The testimonies of all government
witnesses should be dismissed
This is not right!
-We won't allow it!
My statement is absolutely true
The plan to kill Scott was made by...
- Snake in the grass!
''Liar!
- Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru''
Dog! Scoundrel!
- l was part of the conspiracy...
Traitor bastard! Take this!
''Prem, are you out of your mind?.''
''This is a court, your honour.
You can't handcuff us here''
l apologise
for my friend's behaviour
''Go on, say it.
- l'm sorry''
l'll accept any punishment.
But please don't penalise them all
We refuse to be handcuffed!
- This is a court! Not anjail!
Handcuff them!
No one submit to this!
It's against their own law!
This! Is this your law?
Is this your justice?
''You are cowards
killers in the guise of judges!''
Never again shall we set foot in
this dishonest and corrupt place!
''You may pronounce your pre-determined
sentence, whenever you wish''
Do you realise what you have done?
You have gone and abjectly appealed...
''for mercy to that very court,
the very government that we reject?!''
''l know you don't agree with my
methods. But, you have no right...''
to interfere with my fight
''Forgive me, Babu-ji...
but you have stabbed me in the back''
''Bhagat, no son!.''
l'm your father!
You tell me...
what could l do?
You can be an inspiration
for other fathers...
so that they do not hesitate
to send their sons...
to die for freedom...
''This is a test
for all of us, father''
We will have to be strong...
We will have to be strong...
Rajguru...
Under sections 121 and 302...
Death by hanging!
Great!
Sukhdev...
Under sections 121 and 302...
Death by hanging!
Delighted!
Bhagat Singh...
Under sections 121 and 302...
Death by hanging!
Thank you very much
Long Live...
- Bhagat Singh!
Long Live...
- Sukhdev!
Long Live...
- Rajguru!
Long Live Revolution!
They are very precious
for the country. We must free them
''Pandit-ji, l have to receive my
sister... l shall go now...''
Virbhadra...
''Be alert, son. Times are bad''
''Pandit-ji, the police are getting
increasingly desperate for you...''
We've arranged the money.
Why don't you escape to Russia?
''No, it's a war for this land...
l shall fight it here''
Give this money to Rajguru's mother.
She needs it
Sukhdev-Raj! Run!
Revolutionary dog!
''Forgive me, Mother.
l could not serve you longer''
Glory to the Motherland...
''You're my brave brother,
aren't you?. ''
''Live long, my dear one...''
''You have made us proud, son.
May the Lord be with you, always''
My Bhagat... towers above all...
''lt is you who taught me to walk
on the path of freedom, Father''
''Tell me, Bhagat...
You think about everything...''
''Your ideals, your country,
your struggle''
Didn't you ever think
about your mother?
''Whenever l thought of my country,
you were the one l saw...''
''You were my inspiration, Mother...
you are my strength...''
At such ayoung age...
you will leave everyone and go away?
''No Ma, don't cry...''
''See if you cry, so will l...''
then what will the world say?
That Bhagat Singh cried because
he feared death...?
No one will say that...
your Ma will not weep...
and norwill Bhagat Singh
Go son...
Remember to say...
lnquilab Zindabad
ln one voice the whole country
demands only one thing...
Commute the hangings of
Bhagat Singh and his friends!
Bhagat Singh
is not just a person
He is a wave of revolution
that is sweeping over the country
Some may not concur
with his methods
But no one can deny his spirit
of sacrifice and patriotism
''Bhagat Singh must be saved.
- Yes, yes...''
''Silence, please...''
The entire country wants
Bhagat Singh and his friends saved
And everyone knows that only
Gandhi-ji can do this
''Yes, only Gandhi-ji can''
''See, Bapu understands''
He is meeting the Viceroy today.
- He shouldn't sign the Irwin pact
Not until their sentences are commuted
''lf he signs unconditionally,
the Congress will be disgraced''
Doesn't Bapu care for the Congress?
You ought to be ashamed...
''See, Bapu will do whatever he can.
Trust me''
There was another thing...
Not connected with the pact
Three young men
are to be hanged...
''lf he is martyred, the atmosphere
in the country could get prejudiced...''
Can something
be done about this?
But the time for hanging
is tomorrow morning...
Prepare them for the hangings.
- Now...?
But they're supposed to hang tomorrow.
- Fresh orders
The hangings will take place
at seven this evening
''lt's time, Bhagat...
- Two minutes,jailer sahab''
Am reading about Lenin.
A meeting of two revolutionaries!
Let's go
No handcuffs.
- You have to
''Today, we shall walk free.
- Put them on, Sukhdev''
No point upsetting someone
just before going...
''Okay, if you insist.
- Let it be. It's all right''
Thanksjailer sahab.
- Grateful
Give me the colour saffron
''Mother, paint my shroud
in colours of the saffron''
''Her braves venture forth
holding lives in their hands'...''
they bare their breasts...
''laughing defiantly
courting death...''
to usher in a free dawn
To show the world there's life
even in death...
''our sons set out to protect
the honour of their mothers''
''The spark of freedom
thrills the blood in my veins''
O'give me the colour...
''Mother, paint my shroud bloody
in colours of the saffron''
On a glorious day...
like golden Spring...
''we venture wearing our shrouds
for the ultimate sacrifice''
''ln restless hearts
ecstasy abounds...'''
''for time is near when
we bid our Motherland farewell''
''But unto Her seasons to come
we will leave like a waft...''
''a whiff of fragrance. Lucky are ones
given a chance to die such deaths''
Like a wedding march...
we walk to wed revolution
O' give me the colour...
''Mother, paint my shroud bloody
in colours of the saffron''
Today you will get to see...
how true revolutionaries
embrace death with a smile...
for their ideals.
You're lucky
''Bhagat, remember God...
now at least...''
Neither do l fear death...
nor do l believe in Him
Farewell
Any last wishes?
''For the last time
we wish to embrace' ''
Untie their hands
Tie their hands
''From our hearts
can never be purged...''
love for the Motherland
From dust to dust...
''l carry the fragrance
of my Motherland''
''Know then, your braves...''
''for you the feeble,
they fight...''
unto their deaths;
they lie hacked to pieces...
on the battlefield
they never deserted
ls it the romance you yearn for?
Then come unto me...
come holding your head
upon your palm
''Know then, your braves...''
''for you the feeble,
they fight...''
unto their deaths;
they lie hacked to pieces...
on the battlefield
they never deserted
ls it the romance you yearn for?
Then come unto me...
come holding your head
upon your palm
