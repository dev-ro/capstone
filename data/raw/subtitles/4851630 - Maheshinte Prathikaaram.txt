Bro, one Jimson..Where is his house?
Go down from there.

Yes! May I know who are you?
His friend.
Oh! Please be seated. I will be back now.
I heard Malayalis are coming back
to their homelands due to recession
Jimson is not affected, right?
O Mother Mary!
Not a problem for him! It's a global issue!
Only now we were relieved
that he restrained himself from Goondaism.
When he called me the other day,
he never told me about this.
Okay then, I'll move.
Please wait, dear. Have tea and go.

Damn! I'm hung??-
Don't you know that I need something

I'm extremely hungry.
O my dear! He will surely not eat it fully.
Or I will make Uppama right away.
How long will you take to make it?
Please wait patiently for 5 minutes.
No, I can't wait anymore
Why did you do like this?
Don't make noise. Please
wait for 5 more minutes.
Okay, I'm moving.

No, he is here.
Nice.
Wham are you doing?
I'll just make it fresh and add colour.

will cut off your hands
When the right moment comes
we should realize it.
And be ready to click! So simple!
Wham does that mean?
I can only spoon feed you,
but not to chew it for you.
Photography is not something
which can be taught.
One must learn on his own!

Over here, baby! Here... Here..Ah, yes!

Mahesh Bhavana bro.
Bro!
Wake up, please
- Bro, the thing is.. - Oh no!
Oh God! Wham happened? Let me see.
For this small hurt, are
you jumping of pain?
Stay calm
It was bad to take my photograph
without my permission.
Let it be, as it was for a good purpose!
I came to take photo for
sending to Vanitha Mag!
But you sent it to Manjadi Magazine
Anyway photo has been printed in Manjadi.
I'm not telling it because it is my photo.
It's really awesome!
Super!
Thank you.
I got a bit disappointed
when you criticized me the other day.
Due to love, people won't tell the truth!
You are super!

- Yesterday she went to his place.
It seems she pulled out the thorn!- Really?
- How's she? Cheat? - No!
- She won't cheat, right? -No!
We must be very careful!
Maheshetta is too loyal.
Yes, Yes.
What's it?
Hello - Hello, I'm Jimsy.
Whoa! Tell me
I feel, we'll fall in love soon!
Before that, I would like to
clarify a couple of things
First thing is, Sonia told me about Sowmya
She is a distant relative of my mom.
I know her.
During School days, with the fund collected
for buying costumes for folk dance,
she and her friends had Masala Dosai...
no, leave it!
Let me stop discussing that.
Just understand this much.
Her leaving you is your luck!
- Hello -Yeah..
Second thing I;
Jimson whom you wish to avenge,
I'm his younger sister.
Love only if you're brave!
Take your own time and
tell me your decision.
I'm waiting down at the bus stop.
Hello..
Go..Go..
"My heart is blending like a white cloud
in some moonlight of love"
"The dew drops of my desire slowly
glistened like a small sun"
"Come swimming from the depth like a fish"
"Come ﬂying all over the sky"

clearly and is spreading everywhere"
"Today my heart is a blue sky"
"At this time when silence is speaking,"
"On this shore where desires are raining,"

Friends of that fellow are
at Chappathi Junction.
Come quickly. We'll thrash them
to pulp and put slippers.
Are you not ashamed to inform me this?
Let that fellow return
0k, Maheshetta
Don't kick me.
What is happening here?
- What? - Who are you?
'Who are you?
Yeah... Don't run I'll drop you
'Who are you?
I should've turned back and
looked a little earlier:
Oh God! Look at the way he runs!
Who is he?
Juice, juice, juice
Mamootyka's favourite Kummamyka juice!
Someone assaulted his friend gang.
I liked it.
God is truly there.
No, God is not there
Or else would I've employed
an unloyal person like you!
Wham makes you talk so harsh, Babychettan?
- Get up! - Why?
What's happening between you and Sonia?
If I see you hanging around
with my daughter anymore
I'll pop out your eyeballs! Rascal!
- You.. - Enough, stop it.
Did you ask Sonia about this?
Don't ask her. She may spit on your face
I quit!
Is this Artist Baby so cheap?
I may be aVagabond.
But Sonia is a Pearl!
It's true that the idol in the heart
will break if you know great men closely!
Having such a corrupted heart,
if you frame how many ever Gods photo also,
it will be of no use!
Don't provoke me to cry.
I'm Your Baby chettan, right?
DUBAI

But being deported on Supervisor's expense.
Scared, ah!
I'm learning Kung Fu!
Kung Fu is a comedy!
He is a reckless guy!
Then, you may have to get good thrashings!
After marriage, in the name of

I beg your pardon. Please don't mess up!
Please.
Be careful
Nothing to worry, I'm happy, children
Please, Maheshetta!
Yes Mahesh!
I'm going to avenge him
Not necessary for anyone to see that.
But you must be there, Babychetta!
I'm Mahesh Bhavana!
It was me whom you thrashed that day.
I've given aword that I'll not
put slippers until I avenge you.
Is your health okay?
Come on, then.

Hmm.Correct!
Get up!

I wish to marry her.
Best!
What is your opinion, Jimson?
