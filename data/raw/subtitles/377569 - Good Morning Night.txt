Good morning, Sir and Madam.
Before entering the house
I will tell you some information about this building.
It has six units inside
It is very calm and its appearances very good
At the same time it has an underneath parking lot
You can embark the elevator behind
Another advantage is
It has two entrances
Title:  Good morning night
The second entrance is over against kitchen
When you take the thing to come out the garage
You can walk to the kitchen directly
Without cutting through the apartment
Directed by Marco Bellocchio
It is very peaceful and not very arrestive
just like the whole block. 
We will enter now
And start the visit
We arrived.
I will open it so
We can see more clearly
This is the entrance, spacious and practical
And here we already have a hard door
In view of safe angle you can trust
It is very high ground of quantity,
a marble and inset the wood floor
Here is the living room
Let me open the window
Ok.
You can see this unit is very bright
Here
This garden is exclusively for this unit
hello, Milu . We even have a cat.
See?
It isn't maintained very well 
because nobody is living in this unit.
But with some irrigations and some flowers
It will be a completely change.
This is an important part of the apartment
As the first floor
People would pass through your window outside.
This is like a natural cover,
This helps to block the view of the people.
Ok. Let's continue our visit
Together with the lovely cat.
Here
We have two rooms
For making you feel the brightness of the house
And the condition of the room
Another room is in the behind
This room can be use as an office.
I hope it to be later-- 
An infant's building
Forgive me.
But many people come to see this house today.
Do not hesitate to call me.
I will serve for you all the time
See you again. lady and gentleman
See you again.

Who founded a new era of Italian politics life.
In the lecture on February 28th,
He persuaded the Christian democratic party
A party group
Take side toward the national legislature alliance
He is regarded as a communist
He was stab today. It is not a fortuity.
A terrifying political painting has already indicated this affair.
Which also caused his guard team's death
Now take a look of the appearance of the assassinate this morning
However, in the area where the affair took place.
No, I heard we were trying to link to the national legislature.
Make a reaction right away
Yes, the reaction of this morning
It's already strong when the message spreads.
The senator Ramafu showed his mourn to the dead
Among his colleagues
Are an emergency, and the pains of the death
This is a very hot response
The Christ democracy party convenes the meeting
Shakanili attended the meeting
All the people's eyes are full of tears.
Obviously shocked and astonished.
Stand it up.
May I help you?  No, thanks
Do it slowly.
Put it down.
Where is the head?
He is awake
Come from the news of the family union
In the name of the Christian Democratic Party and
The whole nation
This is first-hand news
Thanks
See you again
Who is that?
A kid, a lately born infant.
Ok.
Do you know who I am?
Yes, I understand.
You just saw five corpse wrapped up
Delivered by a white car.
The car of that politician
They have no time to leave the pileup
Only one man tried to take his own weapon
He was killed cruelly
At 10:15, an anonymous person made a phone to Milan.
Call "Nordy", newspaper says
Here is the red team.
We pounded on national heart
The hostage is in our hand
You have seen the car of escort and chairman's car
In the front is the white flya 128.
His rib should have been smashed. He breathes hard.
This is the prescription.
Buy this kind of medicine
Isn't there prescription
Make up your excuse.
Buy an elastic bandage at the same time
To make him believe
A film script
Weird
Where is our deposit?
I want to take all out
I put them at home. I spend money when necessary
Then save the rest in Switzerland.
Now it is safer there.
None of us know what will happen tomorrow.
At least it is in the safe place
But this is illegal
Stop.
Thanks, comrade.
Be careful.
The workers on strike
We are going to the labor union to demonstrate.
I will go with you thus I need not work
Go on strike after Aldo Mok affair.
This is a serious person
Mariano
All of these are going to be burnt.
These, too?
People are talking about the civil war.
We have already attained
But this time
We have no difficulty
To fight against a little part of people.
Completely no difficulty.
We fight a small part of
professional terrorist
They breach the law seriously
And break our freedom as well
We will fight against this handful murderer
Why does nobody respond to him?
They don't agree with his parlance completely
Why don't they rebel?
All of them applause.
Why they hiss?
Calm down.
Because of our combat, we need to conquer
We should open the eyes.
We should be awake.
According to the designation of the national president
Use the political power
Use the school, use the cultural person
Use the family, and the social power
They are living very well somewhere
These young men, or women, unfortunately
Allow the occurrence of this kind of crime
There must be some families.
He knocked on the door
Mark knocked on the door
Is not so satisfied and causes our attention.
I think
In this case, we should
Seek help from the thought of the nonviolence
This is a serious affair
An important procedure for detoxifcation
Did he eat anything?
He thinks only of drinking
He breaths hard.
He wants me to leave the door half opened.
I go up to watch; you shift
Go sleep.
Pleased turn off the television
Zia
How are you recently? You are tanned.
Does it snow a lot?
All of them went crazy
Let's go to some other place
That cook feared
He left with his lover. Yes.
Idiot
Need the community detention
Close the university and the work camps
To you, camp work is very hard.
What are these things?
You realized that the opposite is just a coward
If you are not the stupid, will you be a coward?
The terrorists are risking their lives
Do not listen to them.
Hello
Hello, Tadi
No, I am very glad.
You know I live with my boyfriend.
He doesn't have a telephone
I am usually there
Yes the weather is very good and snowy
I do not know whether I will come or not
What's the matter with my father?
Sorry I did not hear
This will be perfect
Shall we contact each other sometime later? 
I have to go to work
Excuse me, smoking is forbidden here.
Don't you see?
It is not my painting
Let me go to see
Call the police
This elevator will be blocked
Newspaper
Hello Zia
Hello
Nothing to be marked
Where are you going?
Looking for bread
What did people where you work say?
People all discuss about us
What do they say?
They say we are murderers
Ask the factory, who is the murderer indeed
Someone drew our star
Where
In the elevator
Now it is over
If the employees rebel
That will be good
Sorry
Primo
Newspaper
A burglar
Who is that?
A burglar
A burglar
indescribable
Come in
You got the wrong person
I have no power to the change the system
Nor did I take any governmental position
You represent the Christian democratic party
We do not want to judge a citizen or a father
But you symbolize a kind of function
The party you represent
Just like me.  I represented
The whole proletariat
My party is really popular
This is a very big group
Consists of a lot of small persons
Workers, farmers and employees
You are talking about the person, but we are talk about the class
Class struggle, class hatred
I even do not hate you
I do not believe in that class struggle
Will become the pusher of history
The people are all frightened. 
They would like to live in peace
Our party is a party of peace
And mercy
It is modest
This is the hypocritical thought and reactionary thought
A white shirt without suit 
and  without tie
We can't see the hand nor can we see the feet
Can not see the sad trace on the face
a cat outside
On the birdcage
where?  put the cat into the cage
What is the size of a photograph
Four multiply by six, I said
What was the expression of the president
Calm. We can't see any sadness in his face
We received some pictures and a piece of information
We will make a special album
Mr. Chairman, do you want some soup
Close again
We have to be honest to those power organizations
We must have sharp sense of responsibility
Wise and resolute
To fortify the orders on the necessary occasion
To defend for justice and freedom
This is heavy burden on their should
This is the first matter
That what we expect them to do
I resign the souls of the victims
To the endless kindness of the God
Those bodyguards and policemen
Are precious to their family
As well as to Italian people
I call for the support from the whole country 
And the orison of the follower
For their eternal soul and great sacrifice
I request the favor from the God
For the sake of their blood
To incorporate tightly
Our domestic peace is so weak
That the victims' family suffered from such great strike
To find the consolation under the help of the God
Nothing to ease the criminal acts of the shameful murderer
You shouldn't translate but should admit
You ask me to admit
Regretting in absolution is necessary
What should I regret?
My life? I do not think so.
I should admit that you know
But I do not understand this fact
I have to acquire your kindness by lies
You are talking with me proletariat's
Progress and justice
But tell me, how it works
What law supports this kind of justice?
The proletariat's justice is not
Propertied class's justice
Our justice considers pain of the death
There is no right to invoke as well as rescind
Death
Freedom or death, as someone said
You can't hold me permanently
I want to write to my wife
And
To my friends in the party
Certainly
He wants to write a letter
Did he understand?
I do not know
What should we do then?
What about this letter
What shall we do to exterminate them?
You do it
We keep the original piece
Zia, are you tired
Here is the information from the red team.
With a photograph
We inspect them with great enthusiasm
a photograph of Aldo Mok 
A kind of melancholy and sitting down under
This also makes us to understand his life
I imagine his health should be good.
In another news of the red team
blame to the Aldo Mok
This is nonesense.
Belongs to these murderers resposible for the kidnapping.
The working class should lead all
The working class should lead all
where is Anna Lica
She asked for leave of illness
Why are you looking at me?
You can be more beautiful. You look like a nun
Did I mix something? 
Hello
Is your mother
He does not want to talk to you
She says she will come
Have nothing to do
Goodbye
How is your mother?      died.  
So does my father.
Very sorry
Why
You should have hatred.
Do you live a happy life?
Yes
Are you contented to be a little public official?
I do not believe you
Do not believe me
You are 20 years old now. Look at you. What you are doing
Don't you have enthusiasm?
No dream
It is writing for me
I do not know whether I am gifted. But I like
I write novels I write poems
I even write a manuscript
With the name of "good evening to you"
This is the poem from Emily,wrote by Dickson
Did you read it
I have no time
Are you kidding? No one works here
Thanks
Are you engaged or married
Don't you have to work
This is my mother's alliance
Hello
Tadi
Yes, the lunch. Certainly
I do not know
It is my boyfriend but he is not coming.
I will make an effort to persuade him
Ok. I will try.
I will make an effort to persuade him
Are you kidding?
Constitute the different set
To check and comment
It seems everyone has admitted.
This sentence was point out by Mars Vanu
He is a member of the opponent party
The expert pointed out that the letter is written by Aldo Mok
But it can't represent him
This Andy's sentence
Summarizes the political reaction
the reaction to the work of Aldo Mok
I say whatever he writes can't represent him
How are you
Did Mariano leave
No, he is with the chairman
Are you afraid of death?
Why did you ask this?
And you believe that
Jesus also frightened in the west mary garden
In childhood, I also crazy for religion
I hoped to die soon, so that I could go to the heaven early.
How absurd it is. Didn't you be afraid of death?
Everybody has to die.
But everybody's death has different meaning
I think, our advantage lies in
Our preparation of death for ideal
All communisms are like that
Like the first Christian martyr
You have a religion in the heart
More serious than mine
It disregards body much more than our religion
The Christianity used to be so
But this have already passed
The last crusaders was in 1270
The last able man burnt to death in Switzerland in the end of 18 centuries
I will read what you wrote
I will discuss with the comrades of administrations
Do you send me a letter?
Yes
But no response
Your friend no longer admits you
They no longer admit me
So do I. I no longer admit them
They think I became another person
In fact this is true
But it is not what they thought
I always the same
I need to relax
Wake me up in the midnight 
What's the matter with you?
You see I have the hatred, right?
I miss Joana
Certainly
I even can't make a phone call to her
You know it
I know but I believe her
We are warriors. You blah
I even did not take the military service
Comrade, you should be enthusiastic
You left for 5 minutes
They said my mother put the poisonous gas
I want to be ensured that he is there
This is not a dream
I feel consulted seeing this.
What is your dream about?
I do not know
I resolved this problem
I have no dream any more
The God, please bless everything
To the brothers that passed away
In your kindness
Give them eternal peace of rest
And bright never decline  
Make them rest peacefully amen
Daniel,  salute 
In the name of holy son and Holy Father, amen 
See you next year
I want to say two things
Do not forget the follower in faraway time
We came from the north in honor of
our friend
the father of Antonio and Zia
Every year
He was bothersome annually
You will learn something listening to his talk
He is a person with wisdom
He says if people can carry out
Even only 1/5 possibility
All the problem of mankind will be resolved
He controls only love and peace
The merriment of the justice, universal love and life
A newly married one
Viva, newly married
Truth in it, right?
The affairs that mankind do are less than what they can do
It is really the waste of the life power
If the mankind who can make any effort
The world will be different
Some people always do the same affair
When they want to change suddenly, and the world changed
But don't know the banality of their daily life
I saw two murderers in the red team 
Did self-abuse towards an erotic poster
What's the matter with the red team
What
They dedicate their lives to those who exploited them
They should be respected
Did you hear your younger brother's words?
They are more worthy than me
Which makes me feel peace
Get out
Charlie, you remember it. Sing it
We will sing after you
Sing in recall of merriment
Come on Charlie
The strong wind blows, the rain-storm is coming
The hidden mice
However need to continue
To conquer a red spring
The sun rises with future there
If the ruthless death makes us surprised
Will become the revenge of the follower
The route has already been settled
The doomed destiny
Crafty and weak Fascist
The strong wind blows, the rain-storm is coming
The proud followers return home
Their red flag flew high
Our freedom and victory
What
There is no way out in the aspect of law abrogation
A new law
Quoted from the document of the body condition
The mentally illed person becomes similar to the common patient
There is no isolation to settle them in the outside provincial hospitals
Pleas get up
The litigation stops here
The proletariat knows that means
Democracy Christian system
Because they are the first sacrifices
Accusation against Aldo Mok lies in
One stage of sue against the nation
And the war of communism class
Aldo Mok burdens the same responsibility as the nation
So is the sin
The Christian democratic party will be clean up
Under the strong power of the communism
Aldo Mok is sinful. So he was senteced to death penalty
Finished
Shall I take tranquilizer to him
If he wants to
What hapened to him? I do not know
He said to write alone
This pushes them to negotiate
Do you want to sleep?
The chairman wrote to his wife a letter
You should deposit it after tomorrow's work. 
In a common church
Can I watch it? Yes
My dear Nuota
I thought it's time to summarize
Stay calm when you miss me
I have the same feeling on you
I beg you to live as usual
Kiss and daut for me
Every face and every eye
Express my endless love to them with your hand instead of mine
Be strong, my love
In this absurd and not apprehensible disaster
This is the road of the sage
I would like to use my doomed to be dead eyes to see
How we are about to see again
If there is brightness, there must be very beautiful
My love
Hug me tightly, as i will be with you forever
hugs and kisses to Feidado Miluca
My love
There will be fascist republican guard executive team... 
killing me tomorrow
My honey
There will be fascist guard execute team... 
killing me tomorrow
Before I die, I want to tell you
You are my first and only lover
If I'm alive, I will marry you
I will make you happy
When I am the most grieved in my life
The past things emerge like a movie
I want to see her      Don't move
He doesn't want to run away
It's useless
Should we deal with...
those who only know kiss?
Our ladies should become soldiers
I am a wolf. I just want a woman of my own
I go out.     Kill if you want
You are fired      Shit
She will see
Shut up
Let me go
What shall we do
Anyway he will be back
My father visits me with crutch
You are so lucky
Whom are you writing to?
To Luca, my grandson
He is two years old
He will read it oneday
Do you have child?
Yes, a son. 
But I haven't seen him for a long time
I feel so unhappy
As if he never exists
We must find a way to negotiate with them
Consult it with a virtuous department
Consult it with a virtuous department
Above the clan
Godfather
You are back     Yes
IS the free street finished?
We are soldiers, you said it
What's up
I'm thinking the letter from Mok's for his wife
I read it on the newspaper today
It makes me think of a book my father mentioned
Letter from a guy sentenced to death
Mok is still alive
What do you want to say?
Those people in the book are all dead
Mok is still alive
Do you think they will kill him?
They are nothing if they don't kill anybody
They are fool madmen
It scares me         I don't understand
You makes me nervous
Wait
You describe them as those who are mad
Only those personnel masturbating themselves 
support them
Can't you see anything else
Christ's flunky and sham of democracy and regime
Red team is worse.  They want to imitate
They always speak nonsense
Don't you think they want to rule us?
Are your writtings good?
Your scripts are inane
Ok,  you've read
Why is it inane?
Imagination can't save people
Think it's the reality
I'm glad to imagine a woman among gangsters
What's the relationship       A woman
I change the end
I imagine there is a young girl in the defector
But she didn't finish Marx's book like you
Why me?
I just imagine it
Young and beautiful
But try to conceal
The girl wants to save the hostage
At the same time, she doesn't betray her comrades
It's a big betrayal of calling police
Don't you agree?
I don't know.   Continue
But she wants to risk
Or it's too easy
She's risking her life,    why?
How could she...in two months
Do you really want a logical explanation?
The murderer scares her
She loses belief 
She tries to become
unreason and foolish as well
She wants do something not to
become a madman
What are you doing
Do you think they will kill him?
I just arrive after the struggle in the senate
I heard a sound like teal bomb
Police officer said to me
We should use teal bomb to crackdown
For their rebellion
The only way to the iced lake is to use helicopter
The well you saw in the middle
Has been opened by diver    for sinking
No results till now
Prino, what are you doing
You will be seen after being back
Canaries fly away
What's up
Nothing, canaries fly away
Is it you who let them go?  No
Cat must eat them
Isn't your leader around?
He left
Will be back tomorrow
May I read the letter for godfather to you?
I want to listen to your suggestion
I've written many times
I want to read it to your comrades, too
I want to listen to their suggestions
It's my last chance
May I open the door?   I will face around
Come here
Be careful,  the door is open
May I begin?    Yes
Your sanctity
Any woman among you?
I know because my socks are folded
Your sanctity
In the hard time
Makes me full of respect and hope on you
To bw with the biggest moral department
and the biggest dominical spirit
You mediate
After the politic department in Italy
With the rule of justice
On the problem of trade for political prisoners
and the return of me to family
It's necessary for them of my appearance and help
For a serious reason
Only your sanctity
Objection
Understandable country reason
Necessary moral and right of life
My greatest thanks and greatest respection
Yours, sincerely Aldo Mok
How is it
Ask your comrade how could I change
I want to find the word from heart
Only one, not two
She cries
The lady cries
How old is she?
23
I want to askher a question
She is listening there
I want to ask the miss
Her feeling hints that is my letter affecting?
No    I don't like the letter
She is icy
But you cried
Yes, but it's too much
Then I have to rewrite
I don't know it's for an old man
congressional prime minister       unconditionally
In the name of sovereign Jesus
I consult with you
You won't ignore
Please, I knee
Release chairman Aldo Mok
unconditionally
unconditionally
Two copy please
May I tell you something?     I'm listening
Your husband cheats you
Thanks
I announce that state prisoner
What's wrong with Zia
Why do you arrest him
What has he done
Are you our leaderof spirit?
We thank you for gathering us here
Just like you should know
Aldo Mok was sentenced to death by Red team
We want to know now
If he is alive
Binaldo, if you would like to

Where is the place
L.

Don't be kidding, Binaldo
It's adoleful time
We die for theprotagonist and of tire
It's no use Aldo Mok is dead
I'm coming to bless
I'm priest
Do I disturb you?    No
Let's pray
God please bless the family
Let all its members together
In love and peace
It's gift from Jesus    Pray
God please bless the family
For God to salute the tired labours
Don't forget to bless the family peace and food
God please bless the family
Let our passed family members meet in the heaven together
God please bless the family
For the sake of Jesus
She is so tired,     she didn't sleep last night
Is she pregnant?    Yes
See you on the salute     Yes, I will bring you gift
I see you off,   thanks
Bye
Unfortunately
Nobody knows what happened to Aldo Mok
We were shivering yesterday
The deadline of doomsday
It's announced
Judger and murder
We still shiver
With hope and pray
Pray for forgiveness
To Rome, to Italy,  to the world
Especially to his family and friends
The announced crime
The wait gives us hope
I can't abandon my grandson
He likes me very much
He would be sick
He can't bear my disappearance
As a Christian, I can endure death
But now I shouldn't die
I would like to live in your prison
I promise you not to run away
You should try to compose
What else to write?
I've written testaments to all the people
I don't just mean your family
They understand it's not the time
You don't understand I will be martyr
Do they use that fool to perish you?
You should know
When my corpse was on TV
People won't understand,    they will hate you
Write now
Do you decide to kill him?
Yes, we do
Why do you ask him to write?
To let him kill time
Isn't it enough that pontiff knees
Many comrades are moved
Haven't you read it?
Can handle freely and unconditionally
If we set him free unconditionally, we are in vain
And we get nothing
They don't want to accept us
Why don't you accept them either
You    ain't you one of us?
Yes    But I don't understand why shall we kill him
May I say it's unfair?
War of liberation shouldn't be limited to humanism
All the action is advisable
For the victory of proletariate
We are entitled to kill our mother
It's incrediable and inhuman in our view
To eliminate the hate in reality
Is the biggest humanism
It's the gist of our statement
All the people agree with      skeleton leader
All the people
We enjail him for two monthes
Only we are entitled to decide
Can't we wait?
No, it's too dangerous
They negotiate is just to buy time
If there is no suddenness tonight
You are tired,  you must sleep tonight
Eat something
Ok
Christian democratic party will hold a meeting tomorrow 
for Aldo Mok's affair
Another attack in Milan
A doctor's leg is wounded
Those who are responsible for this is
Army of communistic proletariate
Was shot in a post office in Beinuo
Don't eat
We've made a big mistake
We would behind people
those are petty bourgeoisie
For example, my fiancee and her family
Do you talk with her?    Yes
About us    What do you think of me?
Calm down
We are no longer heros, but murderers
Are you idiot in the eye of media
No   where are youi going
Do you follow what chairman siad?    Think about it
They want him to die
If we kill him, we help them
You think about it
We are the strongest
Mercy can't stop us
We only serve for working class
Shut up
It's the last time
You no longer see me again
Help me
What's wrong with him?
He said he is not hungry
I eat his
I'm not hungry.
I go to sleep
