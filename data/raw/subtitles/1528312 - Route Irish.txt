Ferg, it's me, Frankie.
Listen, I'm leaving messages
on your phone.
I need to talk to you tonight.
It's about midnight your time, now.
Phone me back when you get in.
Fergus, it's me. Listen, lad -
I need to speak to you.
I need to speak to you tonight.
Fuckin phone me back, will you?
It's all gone fuckin wrong, here.
I need to...
Where the fuck have you gone, eh?
On the fuckin piss?
I need to talk to you tonightl Nowl
To the front! Go, go, go!
So where we going, then?
- Fuck knows. Africa?
- Africa?
I was thinking
somewhere like France.
France? It's too close.
What about... Brazil?
Or Australia.
Australia. That's good, that.
- How about India?
- India?
India. Still somewhere to go,
isn't it? It's far away.
- New Zealand?
- New Zealand.
Doesrt appeal to me.
It's right by Australia.
I've just decided.
I'm going to Australia.
Rachel.
I need to see him.
Frankie. I need to see him.
I'm really sorry, sir.
Even his family haven't seen him.
The coffin's been sealed.
Yeah, I know.
Let them all go. I'll see him then.
No, I don't think you do understand.
You see, the coffin's been sealed,
because the body...
Well, the deceased
was very badly injured.
Very badly injured,
and he's not complete.
Frankie...
They gave you a fuckin tie...
He hated fuckin ties.
Get it off.
What have they done to you? Eh?
What have they done?
Where's your hand?
At least
I recognise your hand.
With Frankie, you learned always...
to expect the unexpected.
But that could never hide
what a terrific soldier he was.
Courageous, loyal, funny.
Tough as nails, but always fair.
And I'm here today to tell you...
that Frankie, the man,
didn't change when he left the army,
and came to work with us at Tyree.
The skills he learned as a soldier
were used to protect engineers,
bringing water and electricity
to the long-suffering people
of Baghdad,
to protect doctors, surgeons,
experts in child nutrition,
journalists, electoral advisors.
He was a protector,
a nation-builder,
a force for good.
And I'm ashamed
to have to say this, but...
there are no memorials
in this country to men like Frankie.
No Union Jacks,
no guards of honour, no sympathetic
words from politicians.
In fact,
precious little respect at all.
In my book, these men
are the unsung heroes of our time.
Patriots,
soldiers for peace.
And to Rachel,
and Frankie's family...
I want to say it was a privilege
to have known
this true giant of a man.
He was desperate to speak to you.
Where were you?
I fucked up.
I got in a fight.
Two bouncers taking the piss
out of Craig cos he's blind.
I told them it happened in Baghdad,
they don't give a fuck.
They ended up in hospital,
I ended up in a police cell.
Why don't you come back
with me to lbiza for a while?
Huh? No drink, no drugs.
They've got me passport.
Listen, when this case is over,
I'll come. I promise you.
- You promise me!
- I promise.
Jamie gave me this.
He came to visit me...
but it came from Frankie.
It has this little note attached.
"Dear Marisol,
please keep this safe for me.
"If you see Fergus first, please
give it to him - nobody else.
"Got to rush.
Can't wait to see you, love.
"Frankie."
We don't know
everything that happened,
We don't know
everything that happened,
but we have a pretty clear idea
of how it unfolded.
We have some documents here,
which you may want
to look over later.
On the 17th of September,
they was on Route Irish...
Sorry... Route Irish?
Route Irish is...
It's a codename for the road from
Baghdad airport to the Green Zone.
They were on their way to pick up
a Spanish journalist from the BIAP -
the Baghdad International Airport.
His name?
His name was Sergio Perez Minguez.
Which paper?
- Does it really matter?
- Yeah.
Just asking a few questions.
It matters.
The paper was El Pa√≠s.
Frankie and three contractors
were ambushed
approximately two kilometres
from the airport by terrorists.
There are no direct
eyewitnesses as such,
but we do have signed statements,
from another company
of passing contractors,
who passed by
within minutes of the incident.
They said the vehicle was in flames,
and it had been immobilised.
So the vehicle -
was it soft-skinned or armoured?
It was one of our new fleet.
Just came up from Kuwait.
- It was armoured, Fergus.
- Do you have a photograph?
We thought that kind of material
would be a little upsetting,
on a day like this, Fergus.
But we can have a copy
sent to you, Rachel, if you want.
Yeah.
One of the contractors from the
other company recognised Frankie,
who was lying outside
of the vehicle, beside the road.
That's when he pulled to a halt,
tried to stabilise him,
and evacuated him to the CSH,
which is the...
What was his name?
Which company?
Fergus, will you do me a favour,
mate? Just let...
He's got a right to ask questions.
He's part of this family,
as far as I'm concerned.
All I'm doing is trying to get to
the bottom of what happened.
I think it's important
that you all understand
that Route Irish is the most
dangerous road in the world.
I'm very sorry,
but they were just...
in the wrong place,
at the wrong time.
"The wrong place,
at the wrong time"? No.
No fucking way. Not Frankie.
Frankie was never
in the wrong place,
at the wrong fucking time!
You don't fucking understand,
do you?
He was born lucky.
He was born lucky.
- Fergus, fucking hell, mate...
- Sit down!
Fucking get out,
before I lose me temper!
All right, I'm going, I'm going.
Sit down, Andy.
- He was born lucky.
- I'm sorry.
- So sorry about this.
- It's OK.
Don't be sorry. Look...
Those boys were like brothers.
They went to school together.
They grew up as brothers,
he's just...
He's lost the fuckin plot.
Does he... ever see his family?
His mother more or less
deserted him, got remarried
and went to London.
Basically, the only family he's ever
known has been Frankie and us.
He's a good man.
Thanks, Andrew.
These are all for you, Rachel.
There is one small thing.
Frankie borrowed a mobile phone
from an Iraqi driver,
and never had time to hand it back to him.
The driver lost his son a week later,
and he had some photographs
on that phone.
So for sentimental reasons, we're
trying to get it returned to him.
God, that's really terrible.
Sorry, he didn't mention it.
- Look at that. Have you seen that?
- What?
That fucking cunt over there.
- Fucking Haynes.
- What's going on?
It's fuckin Haynes, giving out
his card. He's fucking recruiting.
He's fucking recruiting people
at Frankie's funeral.
- Fuckin hell.
- He's going over.
Fucking cunt.
Giving out your fucking card
at Frankie's funeral!
Fucking cunt!
You fucking scumbag!
You fucking toerag!
We approached him.
It's a wake.
We approached him. Calm down.
- Have a bit of respect.
- Just remember where you are.
- Calm down, Fergus.
- Let me go!
I'm all right, I'm all right.
Hey, it's me.
Give us a bell. Suppose
you're on the piss, aren't you?
Give us a bell when you're back. Ta-ra.
Hey, slaphead, it's me.
I left a message on your mobile.
Listen, phone me back.
Phone me back tonight.
Speak to you in a bit.
Fergus, me back's against the wall.
I've got no one to turn to.
Where the fuckin hell are you?
Answer your fuckin phone!
I've got to deliver this
notice for a non-payment of gas.
Turn up at this house,
the woman comes out the kitchen.
This fuckin... You know?
I said, "Look, I've just got to..."
And I give her this thing.
I said, "It's from the Gas.
"Non-payment of bills.
I've got to serve you this notice."
She went, "Fuck off..."
Next thing, she goes to the back door -
to what I thought was the garden -
opens the door.
Fucking dog.
Fucking head on this dog...
like that, honest to God.
Fuckin...
big American fuckin thing.
- You know these dogs...
- I know exactly what you mean.
- Pit bull, innit?
- This fuckin thing was like that.
Chasing me down...
fuckin chasing me down the road!
- He hasn't had a go at you, has he?
- Fuckin look at that.
Fucking hell, mate!
Aye, aye!
Have a look at his arse!
Didn't know the Chippendales
were coming in, did you?
Eh?
Fuckin hell...
I'd get me arse bit every day,
if could have a bop at that.
Fuckin hanging off me arse!
Fuck this.
What are you doing this for?
Honestly. Seriously.
Cos I like animalsl
No, joking aside,
why don't you come with me to Iraq?
- Ah, no, lad. I've told you...
- Join the circuit with me.
No, lad.
I said to her, I'm staying.
- This won't last forever.
- Listen to me, look.
Ten grand a month, I'm getting.
Fuck off.
Ten grand a month. Tax free.
And you've been?
Ten grand a month?
Ten grand a month, tax free.
One phone call,
you could be with me.
On my fuckin team.
What d'you think?
300, two unknown bravos,
left side of road.
500, abandoned vehicle, right side.
Approaching position.
400, stationary vehicle, left side.
RPG left!
Move right!
- Go right!
- Go right!
Come on!
Go, go!
What are you doing?
Frankie! Frankie!
Fergus! Move!
Move, Fergus, move!
- Thanks, mate.
- Where's Brett?
He's fuckin gone, mate.
I started sorting
through Frankie's things.
Didn't realise how much stuff he's got.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
Stuff arrived from Iraq.
I don't know what's wrong with me -
I found these on the top,
and I couldn't carry on.
This was a week
after you introduced us.
That half-marathon.
My knee was playing up,
but I really wanted to finish,
and he walked
the last three miles with me.
He had this one
on his wall, above his bunk.
- Did he?
- Yeah.
I didn't realise there were so...
many photos.
- There's loads of you.
- Let's have a look.
I remember that day.
I remember that.
Frankie looks really happy
in that one.
I've never even
looked at these before.
I used to pretend
you were both still in Belize,
in the Caribbean, you know.
Not at war.
If it came on the telly, I'd just switch it off.
He'd do anything for me,
and I wasn't there for him.
I never asked him once
how it was... how he was.
Not once, Fergus,
can you believe that?
Now, I've got his ashes.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you punishing yourself?
Rachel, he loved you so much,
you know that.
Don't do this.
I don't know what to with them.
Would you like me to take them?
What did you say?
Would you like me to take them?
He's dead, Fergus.
You're still clinging on.
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry...
I didn't think you'd mind.
Oh, I wouldn't mind.
Like I wouldn't mind him going to Iraq!
He only went there because of you,
and even now, you want
to take him away from me.
Sometimes I fucking hate you, Fergus.
Listen, I'd better go.
- Who was that woman in the church?
- What?
The woman,
at the back of the church.
Who was she?
- What woman?
- You know what woman.
Oh, look...
She's from lbiza.
A lot of the single lads go there.
It's a way of coming down.
It's no big thing.
Every fuckin day out there
could be your last.
You try going from that
to shopping at Tesco's.
That's all it is.
OK, what was her name?
Why?
"Why"? I want to know.
What was her name?
Marisol. Her name was Marisol.
She owned a little bar.
We used to go there.
She was kind, patient.
- Once you realised...
- What was she, Fergus?
Was she your girlfriend,
or just a friend?
Does it matter, Rachel?
Does it matter what she was to me?
- Yeah.
- A bit of both.
- What about Frankie?
- No, no.
Look, Frankie... He was never there.
- He never came there.
- "He never came there"?
So you did everything else together,
- and he'd never met her?
- No.
You shared her! Just tell me.
Yeah, we fucking shared her!
- I can't believe this!
- We fucking shared her!
We shared her. We shared
fucking everything, apart from you!
Got to hit me harder than that,
if you're going to fucking hit me.
Hiya. I've got an appointment
with Harim, the Iraqi musician.
- Room 2, upstairs.
- Room 2, upstairs?
That's her mother.
I think she's the birthday girl.
And that's her brother.
And... Yeah.
There are some video clips.
Do you want to see them?
Yeah. Yeah.
How many videos did you...
There is two video clips,
and those photographs.
- That was everything on the phone?
- Yeah.
Two videos?
The first one.
That's the same party,
same birthday cake.
The same family from the photographs.
They cut the cake.
Ice creams.
'Taif' - that's one of the boys.
Her brother's name is Taif.
- Taif?
- Yeah.
The young boy
we saw in the photograph.
She was here to live a hundred years,
and that's Taif.
They are happy there.
- You want to watch the second one?
- Yeah.
He's asking him to go on the bike.
He wants them to come back.
They hit the taxi.
They killed the family.
You've killed a family.
Nelson, you stupid bastardl
You've killed a fucking familyl
Get downl Get downl
They killed those two boys,
and the family as well.
This is murder.
Do you know these men?
- No.
- Have you ever been to Iraq?
No.
Have you heard of Order 17?
Gives these mercenaries
freedom to act like cowboys.
Total immunity.
They charge through our country,
killing who they want.
No question asked.
We detest them
even more than the army.
Who are you?
I told you...
I'm a researcher,
working for a journalist.
I'm just trying to find out
what happened here.
Who owned the phone,
anything about him.
I need you to go into the phone,
get all the text messages,
voicemails, contacts...
Just translate
everything on the phone.
Look, I'll pay you. I'll pay you well.
I'll pay you L700.
What's to stop me copying this
and putting it on the internet?
There's no point.
If you do that, you'll jeopardise
the whole investigation.
These contractors
know what they're doing.
They'll close ranks, they'll falsify records.
They'll have
the best lawyers in the country.
Right now, they don't
even know this phone exists.
They kill people all the time.
Why are you interested in this case?
The contractor that ran to the taxi -
he died ten days ago, and I think
the company that employed him...
I think they're lying,
they're hiding something.
- Ah... That's why you care about this.
- It's not...
- How about the Iraqis?
- Listen...
Do they count? Do you care about them?
Of course, now listen to me.
Does this video have a date on it?
First of September.
- That's four weeks ago.
- Exactly.
Why should I trust you?
You shouldn't trust anyone.
Oh!
That's a fucking red card, that, ref!
Great! Yeah!
Penalty!
Don't miss it, you soft twat!
Shut up you, you prick.
Frankie called you, yeah?
Yeah, he called me about three times.
He was looking for you,
and he weren't happy.
He was proper fuming.
Did he mention Nelson?
Was that that wophead
in Baghdad, is it?
- Yeah, Nelson.
- Yeah, he mentioned him,
and them two, that were at the funeral.
- Haynes and Walker.
- Yeah. He mentioned them.
What did he say about them?
Anything specific?
No, nothing. He was just like,
"Where's Fergus?
"They're fucking doing me head in,"
things like that.
He didn't have a good word
to say about them.
He just wanted you.
Can you remember the date?
Was it September the first?
I remember it being
after you done them doormen in.
- Was it a Saturday?
- D'you know what, it was.
You were meant to come round
to watch the Everton game.
What's going on, lad?
Dunno, mate.
Something's not right.
Come on, tell me.
You got to fuckin help me.
You're the only one I trust.
You gonna help me, or what?
Listen to me, you've got
to fuckin help me, OK?
Can you not just
come out here yourself?
You think if I could,
I wouldn't already be there?
I can't come out, they've taken me
passport. I've got this court case.
Tommy, you're in and out
of the office all the time.
Just check for me...
Check the incident reports,
first of September.
Shooting on a taxi.
Listen, if they find out
they'll go fucking spare.
I understand that.
I need you to find anything out,
any handwritten notes,
scan them, send them over.
I need to know who was in
the vehicle with Frankie and Nelson.
I need names, numbers.
Frankie was really upset that night.
Talk to Peggy, in the bar.
They were close.
She might know something.
And I need to find Jamie,
the mechanic. You know Jamie?
Jamie's in Afghanistan.
He's gone now.
Well get me a number, any kind
of contact for him, if you can.
Listen to me, that fuckin Nelson,
is he still out there?
Yeah, he's fucking here.
When's he coming home?
I need to know.
- That's all I'm asking.
- Hold on a minute, Fergus.
I'm not getting involved wi' Nelson,
cos the mars a fucking savage.
All right?
I'm not even having a laugh.
- We're talking about my job. I've got three...
- Talking about...?
I appreciate you've got kids,
but talking about your fucking job?
"Talking about your job"?
Have you got a short memory
or something?
We fuckin owe Frankie, both of us.
You fuckin know that.
What were the dates?
Well, you kept this quiet.
How long have you been here?
Months. Lost track.
And it's still empty? What's that about?
Didn't know where to start.
So you just curl up in a corner?
It's what you want.
Some of Frankie's ashes.
It's only right. If he wasn't
with you, he was talking about you.
To be honest... I was jealous.
I realised that...
he didn't really go
to Iraq for the money.
He went to be with you.
Ah, come on, Rachel. That's daft.
- I think he loved you.
- Fuck off, Rachel.
Here.
I think it was just going through his stuff,
I realised that maybe
I didn't know him.
No, Rachel, that's wrong.
You did, you knew him.
You knew the best part of him,
without a gun in his hand.
Did you find his mobile?
Was there any messages?
Yeah, there was a few.
Nothing important.
- What about his laptop?
- Think it's broken.
It rattled when I picked it up.
- Did you check his e-mail?
- I don't know his password.
I bet you do, don't you?
Are you going to tell me, Fergus?
Six letters.
"Rachel".
Same tattoo as Frankie.
What is it with you two?
Can you give me the statement
that Haynes sent you?
Yeah, course I can.
Did he send any photos
of the burnt-out vehicle?
No, not yet.
But the contractor who found them...
He sent these of the vehicle.
They're fucking horrible, Fergus.
There, there, there.
Oh yesl Oh, yesl
They're gonna get it.
Yes, naughty little boys.
Yesl
Yes. Yes... Yes.
Right, gone out
of range on it. Roger.
Got him. Good. Second one.
Hit the other one.
Go right, see if anyone's
moved by the truck.
Right, store that.
There's a guy who moved,
right there.
Hit him.
When I was in the SAS,
we used to do
joint operations with the US.
Special Forces.
"The hunt for terrorists"?
Load of fucking bollocks.
Chicken farmers,
mostly, these people.
You'd go in, and...
you grabbed them,
and you cuffed them.
Put their hands behind their back.
And their fucking wrists
would blow up like balloons.
They'd be pissing themselves,
shitting themselves,
children screaming, women screaming...
One night we did
eleven houses in a row.
Eleven fucking houses - we got nothing.
Eleven houses...
And you know, the one thing...
it's ironic, but if they didn't
support Al Qaeda before,
then they did after,
I can guarantee you that.
And the fuckin Yanks...
the Yanks would torture them.
Fuckin torture them!
What did they do?
One time, I saw this guy
being interrogated.
They used an electric prod on him.
They half-drowned him
in a swimming pool.
But what can you do?
They had this motto -
"No blood, no foul."
What does that mean?
Means if they don't fuckin bleed,
you've done nothing wrong.
- Want another drink?
- Yeah.
Hi, love. Pint of lager
and a vodka and tonic, please.
Room clear!
One bravo!
Move away! Tell them.
Stand away!
Move out the fucking way.
Come on, let's get that kid out!
- Get the kid.
- He's taking too long!
- Get out!
- Get out the way, I'll get him.
Get outside,
you stupid fuckin rag-head!
They had this orchard.
They wouldn't give any information, right?
So the Americans threatened them,
to flatten the orchard.
So this woman, she's fuckin
hangin on to this tree,
cos that's her fuckin life.
She's holding on to this tree.
She's not gonna move.
So they order this young soldier -
young black kid -
to go in, get her out.
But he's nearly fuckin breaking her arm,
she's struggling so much.
The fucking tanks go in,
roots get torn up...
This kid's standing there,
he's trying hide his tears.
And the thing that got me
more than anything is...
they're fuckin playing jazz music
on the speakers.
On the tanks, there's jazz music.
So I left. I got out the Residents,
that was it.
But you didn't get out, did you?
You joined up with Haynes.
- You were still there.
- Because Haynes...
It was me last chance...
at a big payday.
Why did you go on your own,
if it were that good?
Cos I wanted my own firm.
I wanted a piece for meself.
And why not?
And you know what?
Haynes was fucking furious.
He couldn't get it in his head,
how a scruff like me -
from fuckin here - a scruff like me,
had an eye for the fuckin
main chance, as fast as him.
What happened, Fergus?
I lost three of my lads
in an ambush. Good lads.
Got the client out. The golden rule -
"The package always comes first."
I left the lads behind.
We never did that in the army.
I thought I was OK, then I got
a letter from one of the mothers.
Things just started falling apart.
Slap me.
Come on, Rachel. Slap me.
Come on.
Harder.
Harder.
Punch me.
I was in the archives.
Donald came in.
- I had to drop it.
- He's still out there, is he?
Aye, he's a fuckin arse.
Well listen...
did you manage to get anything?
The first of September,
tell me what you found.
Well, there's nothing happened,
by all accounts.
"There's nothing fuckin happened"?
They shot up a fuckin taxi!
Well, there's fuck all
in the record about it,
cos I've checked everything.
So...
Did you find out who was
on duty with Frankie that day?
- Nelson.
- Nelson? Well, that ties up.
And three Colombian guys, as well.
Three Colombian guys?
Did you get their names?
Nah, never heard of them.
Look, I need you to get
the fuckin names, mate.
Just get them, and text me with them
as soon as you've got them.
What about Jamie?
Any word on Jamie?
He's in Afghanistan, up some
fuckin mountain, fixing Jeeps.
- For fuck's sake.
- Look, I'll try to get a message to him.
Best I can do, man.
I appreciate your help,
and I won't forget this.
I won't forget.
Right, see you later.
Who was that?
Tommy, a contractor in Baghdad.
Who's Jamie?
Jamie's an old mate from army days.
A mechanic.
And what did you mean, when you said
someone shot up a taxi?
Look...
Something happened out there.
Something really bad.
First of September,
two weeks before Frankie died.
There's someone I want you to meet.
An Iraqi musician.
Has it got something
to do with Frankie?
I want to know
what's going on, Fergus.
I don't know, myself.
But I tell you what,
I'm going to find out.
This song is from Mesopotamia -
which means
"The land between the two rivers" -
the Tigris and the Euphrates,
where the homo sapiens
learned to write, to count,
and mark the stars.
Which anthropologists call
"The Cradle of Civilisations".
In my dreams, it may be once again.
That's one of the children,
shouting Taif's name.
"Taif is somewhere, here."
Oh, Frankie.
You've killed a familyl
- Nelson, you stupid bastardl
- They're all dead.
You've killed a fuckin familyl
Frank, get back
in the fucking vanl
You've killed a fucking familyl
Fucking get in the van. Get inl
Fuck's sake...
Just get inl
There are several messages
you should hear, as well.
"Taif. Ranj.
Answer me please. Where are you?
"Why you went out?
You didn't tell me.
"Who's listening to me?
Where are you now?
"I don't have anything else
without them.
"Please, they're both clever boys,
they haven't done anyone.
"Please, don't touch my boys.
"I'll be your servant.
"I'll sell my car, I'll sell my house,
give you anything you ask me."
"They are only my sons,
they are my only sons."
Rachel!
Rachel.
Rachel, wait.
