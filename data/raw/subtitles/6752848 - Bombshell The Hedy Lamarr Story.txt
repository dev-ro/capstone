Hedy wanted to do
something important
with her life.
She wanted to make her mark.
But she was totally judged
by that face.
One of the most
glamorous stars
show business
ever has produced...
One of the most glamorous stars
the screen has ever known...
And one of the most beautiful
women in the world...
Well, shall we all
say it together?
- I think we all know.
- ♪ The most beautiful girl
in the world ♪
Hedy Lamarr.
She becomes the model
for Snow White.
And she inspired Catwoman.
Oh, my God, I mean, she was...
she was the best-looking
movie star that ever lived.
She became my inspiration.
Thank you, thank you,
Hedy, thank you.
It's not Hedy, it's Hedley,
Hedley LaMarr.
I don't know whether it's true,
but you hear things.
I heard that she was
a scientist.
So is this true?
Within the nerd community
at Google,
Hedy Lamarr was
this beloved figure.
For me, she is
this perfect underdog,
like,
crime-fighter-by-night story
because she lived this life
of great accomplishments
and people
didn't really know about it.
I remember sitting up
in a bare attic with my mother,
she said,
"Look, I got a patent."
"You got a patent, Mom?"
- "Yeah."
- "You invented something?"
"Yeah, I invented a secret
communication system, look."
And, today, we have Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth.
That's my mother's technology.
You see?
No.
Well, it is kind of hard
to explain.
Hedy had one of the most
recognizable faces of her time,
and yet, she said
she was never seen
for who she was.
So, who was she?
Tell me something
that I didn't know about you.
I want to be a simple... I am!
I'm a very simple,
complicated person.
Could you help her?
- Yes, but not here.
- But you know what I mean?
You know what I mean!
This book you're writing now,
Hedy, are there...
Incidents, things that
nobody ever knew about me.
- Regrets?
- Oh, no, no regrets.
You learn from everything
all the time.
When I was a child,
she was always working
on her story.
She was going to let
the world know her version
and her story
and her autobiography
in her words, but yet,
it never came to be.
Hedy became a recluse.
She wouldn't even see
her family.
We wanted to spend time
with her,
but she kept us away.
There was so much scandal.
There were different chapters
of scandal.
There was her movie Ecstasy
that she made as an adolescent,
the nudity and the explicitness
of that,
and then the multiple
marriages and divorces,
and then the arrests.
My mother has a hard side
and an easy side,
and as her son, growing up
with Hedy was difficult.
I mean, she had so many sides
and so many faces,
and even I couldn't understand
who Hedy Lamarr was.
I'd been waiting for somebody
to contact me
about Hedy Lamarr
because I had the tapes.
Where did I find it?
It's embarrassing.
I found it
behind that blue trash can.
I'd had stuff stowed there
and I moved it out of the way,
and there it was.
So, in all,
there were four tapes
and this is the first one.
Ready?
Yes?
This is Fleming Meeks
at Forbes.
Oh, hello! Thank you so much
for the roses.
You're very welcome.
I love them!
I'm very pleased.
I was a staff writer at Forbes
and my father was
an astrophysicist at MIT,
and he called me one day,
and he said,
"I've just talked
with this friend of mine here
and he told me
this amazing story
about Hedy Lamarr,"
and, of course, I pursued it.
I want to sell my life story
to Ted Turner
because it's unbelievable.
The opposite
of what people think.
The brains of people
are more interesting
than the looks, I think.
People have the idea
I'm sort of a stupid thing.
I never knew I looked good
to begin with.
Because my mother
wanted a boy
named Georg (George).
So unfortunately
I didn't become that and...
she wasn't too thrilled
about that.
I was...
different, I guess.
Maybe I came from
a different planet, who knows.
But whatever it is...
inventions are easy
for me to do.
My mother was very inventive.
In this article,
"Hedy's interest in gadgets
really started
at the age of five
when she took
an old-fashioned music box apart
and put it
back together again."
And this was
her childhood music box.
You wind up
this little rabbit here
and it plays
an Austrian melody.
My mother was curious.
She had a very intellectually
curious mind.
She wanted to know
how things worked,
and her father told her things.
Although her father's
official position
was as bank director,
he was also interested
in technology.
So, when they went
for their walks,
he would point out to her
how things worked.
The streetcar
with its electric trolleys
leads these wires
to a factory
that generates electricity.
She learned
to associate invention
with this father,
whom she adored.
My father...
He was a wonderful person.
I miss him.
They lived in Vienna
in a fashionable district,
the 19th District.
It was heavily Jewish
but also
very artistically inclined.
Hedy's parents were both
assimilated Jews.
That was very common in
the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
They were wealthy,
they were cultured.
They took their daughter
to the opera, to the theater.
Everyone was connected with
this world of make believe.
I miss Austria.
Have you ever been there?
I've been to Austria, yes.
Not Vienna?
Fall is the best time
to go there.
Where did you go to school?
In a private school in Vienna.
My favorite thing in school
was...
What's that thing
when you mix things?
- Chemistry.
- Chemistry! Thank you.
Well I'm good at that.
In a different era,
she might very well
have become a scientist.
At the very least,
it's an option
that was derailed by her beauty.
By the time she was a teenager,
when she walked into a room,
conversation stopped.
She was probably
a little dazzled by this power,
testing it out,
seeing how it works
and so forth.
There's a word for what I was.
A... what?
'Enfant terrible.'
I know that.
I know that much French.
Well good!
There are stories about her
heading to the photographer
to get her photos taken
with and without clothes.
She lived in a society
where there were
many prominent women who had
not only incredible careers,
but loads of lovers.
Women, especially in the arts,
could have certain
kinds of liberties
that they would not find
in normal bourgeois society.
Hedy decided one day,
at the age of 16,
that she was ready
and went off to the largest
film studio and walked in.
Very quickly,
within a couple days,
they had her in a walk-on.
I have seen
the little weird Viennese films
that she made in the beginning
where she's
a little bit awkward
but clearly beautiful.
But it's clearly
the 1933 film Ecstasy
that really brought her
into everyone's consciousness.
Hedy became world famous
the moment she appeared naked
in Ecstasy.
The Pope denounced it
and Hitler refused it
to be shown.
People were just shocked by it.
It was quite controversial
because she simulated an orgasm.
I think it was the first time
anybody had ever done that.
I mean, in some ways,
it was analogous to a sex tape.
This was so scandalous
and really marked her
as this certain type of woman.
I don't know
if you ever saw that.
I don't believe I have.
There was a scene
in which I was totally alone
but it was cut so that it
showed that it was
a very hot sex scene,
which it wasn't.
You must have seen
a picture of that, right?
Yes, ma'am.
And I said, "Why do I have
to put my arms together?"
And they said,
"Don't ask so many questions."
"If you don't do what I say
then I put the needle
through the couch
so you do what I tell you."
And I was...
I didn't want to make any
commotion, so I did that.
And when I came back to Vienna
my father... I mean...
it was horrendous.
He wanted to kill me
practically.
What I did though...
right after that
I said, "I'll show them."
Fritz Kreisler
composed a musical called
'Elisabeth of Austria, '
the Queen of Austria,
and I had a big, big, big
success with that.
On stage.
I had ovations
and my father cried.
And then I got married
right after that.
Hedwig, as an actress,
drew, of course,
the attention of many people,
and one of those was
a man named Fritz Mandl.
I was married to
a munitions tycoon in Austria!
He is the Henry Ford of Austria.
He, at that point,
is 14 years her senior.
He is allied with the Nazis
because he's
an armaments manufacturer.
As it is the same today,
a lot of wealthy men would like
to decorate themselves
with beautiful women,
and I think she was,
for a minute,
fascinated with that as well.
We had a country house
with 25 guest rooms.
And we went hunting.
And I loved that.
Do you know guns?
Yes.
I had a Browning
and I shot a stag into the neck
350 meters.
Meters? Very long.
I'm a good shot
so be careful!
Hedy was Mandl's armpiece
at the banquets that he served
for admirals
in the German and Italian Navy.
She sat there and it was
her job to be beautiful,
but she was bored
out of her mind.
Fritz Mandl was,
by German measures, Jewish,
and therefore,
Hitler was concerned
not to be seen with him,
and I doubt very much
if Hitler was a guest
at one of their houses,
but Mussolini was.
I assume that
your first husband
was supplying arms to the...
To the Germans.
But he never let me in on...
He never even let me
come into the factory.
I disturbed the people.
I didn't know why...
Fritz did not like the effect
that his beautiful wife had
on other men.
He was immensely jealous
and paranoid about his wife.
He was constantly convinced
that she might be having
an affair.
The big mistake
my husband at the time did
he bought up prints of that...
dumb picture!
Mandl had the problem
of this film,
this dirty picture
which he tried to buy up,
and they started cranking
them out by the dozens,
and he eventually gave up
because, obviously,
they could make as many copies
as he chose to buy.
He turned out to be someone
who had the maids listen in
on her phone calls.
She had everything
she could ever want,
except the one thing that
Hedwig Kiesler always wanted
which was freedom.
By 1937,
the war was inevitable,
and she was
in a desperate situation.
Because after all,
Hitler had everything
in the palm of his hand.
When Ecstasy was released,
Hitler told the American press
he was banning it
because the lead actress
was Jewish.
Jewish people were not allowed
out on streets
at certain times of the day
and, gradually,
they were denied
more and more civil rights.
And this is one thing that led
to Hedy's father Emil's death
was his stress and worry
about what was happening.
He died suddenly
from a heart attack.
And I think that was
the turning point for her.
Deep traumatic experiences
change us,
and she came out the other side
remembering what her father
had advised her from childhood:
"Be yourself.
Choose and take what you want,"
which was certainly
Hedy's quality all her life.
There are stories,
whether they're apocryphal
or not,
who knows, but almost like
a prison escape.
Hedy had people watching her
all the time.
There was no way
to break loose.
So, one night,
they were having a dinner party,
and my mother
helped choose the maids
and caretakers,
and so she found someone
that looked like her a lot
'cause she had this in mind.
So, she had
this sleeping powder,
and she made this tea
and she switched the cups
with the maid,
and the maid drank it
and kind of fell asleep.
Now my mother's all ready.
She took all her jewels,
put 'em in the lining
of her coats.
She put on the maid's costume.
She jumped on her bicycle
and rode off.
My parents had friends
in England.
So I went there.
Pre-war London
was a safe haven.
Hedy spent several months there
trying to figure out
her next steps.
We one day went to a movie.
I forgot even what it was.
And they happened
to have a lion.
You know, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
So I said,
"Oh I want to be in that!"
She quickly found
an American film agent.
Somebody took me to a hotel
and there was
a little man there.
I didn't know who he was,
what he was.
I couldn't speak English,
obviously.
Louis B. Mayer
was the little man.
That was Louis B. Mayer?
With his entourage, yeah.
Louis B. Mayer,
of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer,
had come to Europe to buy up
all the actors and actresses
who were escaping Nazi Germany.
He figured he could take them
back to Hollywood
and enslave them in
his Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer empire
for a cheap price.
He offered her $125 a week
and reminded her
that she had to keep
her clothes on.
And she said, "I'm sorry,
that's not good enough,"
and walked out.
She impressed him, I'm sure.
People didn't usually turn down
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
But minutes
after she walked out,
she had second thoughts
and quickly booked passage
on the Normandie,
the ship Mayer was sailing
back to New York.
She, I think,
probably rather cleverly
made sure that she saw him
about the decks
in her tennis clothes
and so forth,
in her bathing suit.
On the first
or second night out,
Hedy went
to her very modest cabin
and pulled out
her designer couturier gown
and she put on
the last baubles that she owned
and she walked
through the dining room
of the Normandie,
past Louis B. Mayer's table.
There's Douglas Fairbanks Jr.
sitting right there,
and his eyes are glued
to Hedy Lamarr,
as are the eyes
of every man and woman
in that dining room.
And Louis B. Mayer knew
he had to have her.
He snapped his fingers
and I didn't know why,
I didn't know what...
all of a sudden
I got $500 every week.
Hedy Kiesler,
Hedy Kiesler, Kiesler.
We gotta do something
about the name.
So, Louis B. Mayer's wife
was there and she said,
"Well, Barbara La Marr
is one of my favorites.
Why not Hedy Lamarr?"
Lamarr, the sea, perfect.
Let's be Hedy Lamarr.
She didn't speak
a word of English.
She learned those few lines
on the boat to convince
Louis B. Mayer that he should
hire her as an actress.
She created her own reality,
and I find that
really fascinating.
You know, when things
don't come easy
figure out why...
and then do something about it.
And if people...
walk over you
then don't let them!
She stepped off
the ship in New York
to crowds
of flashing light bulbs
and reporters firing questions
at her as Hedy Lamarr,
the latest discovery
of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
Hello, everybody,
this is Hedda Hopper
reporting to you from Hollywood,
that fabulous place
where everyone wants to live
but seldom does.
In Hollywood,
she was kicking her heels
and listening to music
and being free.
She was a little bit worried
because the contract,
it had kind of a trial time
before they used her,
and she wasn't getting
any movies or parts
and she was very insecure
that they didn't want her,
especially since
she made Ecstasy
and that was kind of
a black mark on her.
Right from the beginning,
one of her first interviews
is with Hedda Hopper, who was
the famous gossip columnist.
That's where she does
her greatest acting
is for Hedda Hopper,
crying tears
about how she was forced
into this nude scene
and somehow perverted
by these European filmmakers
who have no morals whatsoever.
And then,
my mother went to a party
by chance one night,
and Charles Boyer was there
and he was smitten by her.
And he said,
"Can you be in my movie?"
"Oh, no, no, no, my English
isn't good enough, no."
And he took her hand, kissed it,
he said, "I'll hold your hand
through the whole film."
- "You will?"
- "Yes."
"All right, I'll do it."
So, that's how that started.
Charles Boyer
was a diamond thief.
She had diamonds.
He thought she was a wealthy,
noble-born French woman.
He didn't realize that she was
another scamp like him
from the streets of Paris.
There's a wonderful line
in the film where he says,
"What did you do before?"
Before what?
Before the jewels.
I wanted them.
That film made her
a star instantly.
When I was a kid,
I saw her in Algiers,
I said,
"I'm gonna get to Hollywood
and I'm gonna marry her.
And if I don't get to marry her,
I'll get to buy her dinner
and feel her up under the table.
Whatever I can get."
After Algiers,
Hedy Lamarr was on the cover
of all the movie magazines.
Suddenly,
you have in Hollywood,
a lot of women parting
their hair in the middle,
darkening it,
and changing their makeup
to be little Hedy Lamarrs.
Every woman wanted to be Hedy
and every man
wanted to date her.
She seduced men and women.
She was able to meet
artists, directors,
brilliant actors,
the greats at that time.
Including Kennedy,
whom I knew very well.
Oh really?
Yeah,
before he became president.
He asked me out.
So he said,
"What can I bring you?"
and I said, "Oranges,"
because...
I lack vitamin C.
Would you believe
any other person
would've asked, "Oranges"?
That's the way I am.
A fool!
No matter what,
you expect Hedy Lamarr
to be glamorous, sophisticated.
Quite the opposite,
she loved picnics,
she loved to go
scavenger hunting,
she loved to play Charades.
She wasn't very good at it,
but she had a great time.
You know, no pretenses.
She was fun to be with.
At that point,
she could have married anyone.
She surprised her fans
by choosing
a portly screenwriter
and producer
named Gene Markey.
Her letters show she was
madly in love with him.
"Dearest Mommy,
I never would have thought
that I could ever fall
in love again.
Gene has an unbelievable number
of traits
in common with Dad.
So considerate, it's touching."
He promised Hedy he'd write
screenplays with her.
They even adopted a son.
But within months
of their marriage,
he began dating
other beautiful actresses.
Hedy was heartbroken.
She said people
never got past her face.
You never knew
if they loved you
or their fantasy of you.
"A man does not try
to find out what is inside.
He does not try
to scratch the surface.
If he did, he might find
something much more beautiful
than the shape of a nose
or the color of an eye."
Only a year after Algiers,
not only was
her marriage failing,
her career was in trouble
as well.
She was terribly unhappy
with the films she did for MGM
because Louis B. Mayer
gave her bad scripts
and the films did nothing.
You never got very much
out of this, did you?
I got plenty.
All I asked for,
except the frosting.
Hedy actually went
to Louis B. Mayer
and petitioned for a role
in Boom Town.
I'm going to do it
because I want to.
It was a small part,
and Louis B. Mayer,
at first, was reluctant.
Okay, stranger.
Boom Town was a huge,
tremendous success
for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
After Boom Town,
Hedy Lamarr's career was secure.
It's almost unfathomable
how busy she was in 1940.
They were expected to do
what the studio wanted.
Bette Davis described it
as a "slave system."
And they were owned
in the sense
that they had signed contracts
that bound them to studios
for seven-year periods.
My mother was worked
like a racehorse.
She had to run fast
all the time.
They gave her pills
to wake her up to perform.
Pretty sure it was
some form of speed.
And then, to make them sleep,
they gave them sleeping pills.
They worked six days a week.
Women really had to get
to the studio early
because they had to have
their hair done,
their makeup put on,
their costumes put on.
And then, you know,
they worked into the night.
And here's what's remarkable.
After a grueling day
on the set,
Hedy didn't go to bed.
She wasn't socializing.
Hedy was at home working
on her latest invention.
Inventing was her hobby.
She not only had
a complete inventing table
set up in her house,
but Howard Hughes gave her
a small version
of the set of equipment
which he had in the trailer
where she stayed
in between takes
in her motion pictures.
When Hedy first met
Howard Hughes,
he was dating
every Hollywood star,
and she did date him.
Howard Hughes, of course,
was a great airplane designer,
so probably they had
a compatible spirit
with one another.
It was definitely cerebral
because she said
he was the worst lover
she ever had.
Howard Hughes wanted to build
the fastest planes
in the world
so he could sell them
to the Air Force.
She was fascinated by his mind
and his factories,
and she wanted to go and see
where everything
was being made and built,
and she met all the scientists.
He said to her,
"Anything you want my scientists
to do for you,
just ask 'em
and they will do it."
He relied on me.
I thought the aeroplanes
were too slow,
so I decided that's not right.
They shouldn't be square,
the wings...
So I bought a book of fish
and I bought a book of birds
and then used the fastest bird,
connected it with
the fastest fish.
I drew it together
and showed it to Howard Hughes
and he said,
"You're a genius."
- You did?
- Yep.
Yeah.
Very strange person that was.
Very brilliant.
But very misunderstood as well.
She invented,
during that period,
a tablet that would fizz up
and make a cola.
I had two chemists Howard
Hughes gave me to do that.
You know, during the war
nobody had Coca-Cola
and I wanted to compress it
into a cube
so that servicemen
and factory people,
all they had to
have was water and put it in.
But I didn't realize
that every state
has different
strengths of water,
so it dissolved on the bottom,
on top, in the middle.
It was one of my boo boos.
I didn't do that right.
But I don't have to work
on ideas.
They come naturally.
What must have been going
through the mind
of this young woman.
She's become
a huge international film star.
But at the very same time,
her country,
the past as she has known it,
has been eliminated.
In 1940,
the war was raging in Europe
and the United States
was a neutral country,
and Hitler
was basically taking over
all of Western Europe
and threatening
to take over Great Britain.
If only I could do something.
Oh, darling,
you've done so much already.
You almost made me forget
about being afraid.
Oh, I am afraid now.
She did have a secret.
When Hedy arrived
at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer,
Louis B. Mayer specifically
ordered all of his stars
not to talk about
their religious backgrounds.
People would say,
"You're Jewish,"
and I'm like, "No,"
and I called Mom and said,
"Mom, are we Jewish,"
and she said,
"Don't be ridiculous."
I never heard the word "Jewish"
from my mother's lips.
The Jewish part of her,
she just left behind.
She was probably afraid
for many reasons.
And I could feel it,
I could see that
she was protecting herself.
I became a manicurist.
That's how I met Hedy.
I told her that I survived
the war with camps
and running for my life.
We talked about
what was going on
and how I come to America.
I find myself
on an American ship.
I was shaking with fear
because we heard noises.
We were attacked
by the Nazi submarines.
I remember saying,
"Oh, dear God,
please don't kill me now,
let me see America."
At the time,
Hedy's mother was preparing
to make the treacherous
Atlantic crossing herself.
She'd fled Austria
and gotten as far as London
where she and Hedy
were able to write each other.
"Mommy, my mind
is so preoccupied
and I would love it
if you could come immediately
since the times,
they are very uncertain.
I have been listening
to the radio day and night
for over a week,
and I've gotten
barely any sleep."
Vivid pictures
of a naval action
have just been released.
One day,
in the summer of 1940,
a shipload of children
was torpedoed.
All hands lost
including 83 children.
At the time,
the German U-boats
were on the verge
of winning the war.
They seemed to be unsinkable
because they easily
outmaneuvered
the outdated British torpedoes.
In times of crisis,
most of us feel powerless,
but a few discover
in themselves
unexpected strength.
And Hedy being Hedy,
she said,
"I'm gonna do something
about that."
So, in this article, Hedy says,
"I got the idea
for my invention
when I tried to think
of some way
to even the balance
for the British.
A radio-controlled torpedo
I thought would do it."
A torpedo launched
on a given trajectory
might need to be changed,
redirected.
You want, ideally,
your launching boat
to communicate
with the torpedo.
The problem is you can't control
radio communications.
They're not secure.
Your enemy, if they're smart,
finds the frequency with which
you're talking to the torpedo
and jams it.
Jamming.
The Germans fill the air
with radio interference.
She came up with the idea
of a secret way
of guiding that torpedo
to the target
that couldn't be interrupted,
that couldn't be jammed,
that couldn't be messed with.
It was secret.
Instead of just one transmit
frequency communicating,
she said, "What if we changed
those frequencies constantly
in sync with each other?"
Frequency hopping.
You couldn't jam it
because you'd only jam
a split second of it
in a single frequency.
So, frequency change,
frequency hop,
frequency hop, frequency hop.
That concept,
secure radio communications,
was brilliant.
Now there are various versions
of how she came up
with her profoundly
original idea.
One theory is
that she stole it.
The man who championed
that idea was an engineer
who once interviewed her
named Robert Price.
Robert Price was a pioneer
in secret communications,
and he gave me his number
and I called him up.
She's an inventor
but I don't know in what sense
exactly she is an inventor.
If I want to be harsh
I would say she was
a plagiarizer, you understand?
Hedy's first husband
was Austria's leading
munitions manufacturer.
Robert Price said to me
that he thought
that she just smuggled the idea
out of her husband's board room.
In fact, he called her
the Mata Hari of World War Il,
the most notorious spy
who seduced men
and got all kinds of secrets
out of them.
The engineers at Mandl's firm
might just have known
about the frequency hopping.
Is that how you were aware
of frequency hopping?
No. What, my husband?
No. Nobody did that...
invent that before.
I mean, I know what I did.
I don't care
what other people say about me.
The record is very clear
that the Germans
had not come across the idea
that would be
Hedy's signal contribution,
what she called
"frequency hopping."
I don't think she was a spy.
It was so obvious.
I mean they shot torpedoes
in all directions
and never hit the target,
so I invented
something that does.
I mean, I can't explain.
I have an inventive mind.
I think Hedy got her idea
from a curious coincidence
that, in 1939,
the Philco Radio Company
produced
a new top-of-the-line
remote control.
There's a new gadget
just out, see?
You dial your station here
and you hear it over there.
- Well, where are the wires?
- There ain't any wires.
That's the trick.
We know Hedy was interested
in the remote control
and how it worked
because the device is sketched
in the invention notebooks.
In here is all the evidence
of my mother's invention.
It's this.
She dialed in a radio station
and she said,
"If we hop around frequencies,
just like I'm hopping
around radio stations
on this dialer,
when I transmit this information
to the torpedo,
we can make it totally secret."
So the Philco magic box
probably inspired
the whole thing.
The fact that she understands
this frequency component
of the signal
and how that changes
is, I mean, genius in a way.
I mean, we know Thomas Edison
was not an engineer.
You don't have to have
eight years
of a graduate degree
in engineering
in order to come up
with something new.
In the inventing process,
there is a moment
of high lucidity,
of clear thinking.
In the case of Hedy,
she had this lucid moment
without knowing how she was
going to put it together.
She didn't have the training
to make it happen.
And she said that,
"The idea was mine,
but the implementation
was George's."
My mother met George Antheil
at Janet Gaynor's party.
And she liked
George Antheil a lot.
So, when she left
the party early,
she wrote her phone number
in lipstick
on the windshield of his car.
They discovered that they had
a great deal in common.
At the time,
I think they both felt
like they were not understood
for their true qualities.
George Antheil was really quite
an unusual American composer,
extremely avant-garde.
Now musicians all over the world
love to play Antheil's music,
they love to get
into that confrontational space
that was his.
He had a gun,
then he would pull it out
and he'd bang it
down on the piano
right at the beginning
of the show,
and shout, "Lock the doors!"
Sometimes it sounds
like his music is jazz
put into a Cuisinart.
It's just, you know,
chopped up and there it is.
Well, George Antheil
wrote a book
called Bad Boy of Music,
and in chapter 32,
"Hedy Lamarr and I invent
a radio torpedo."
He says,
"We began talking about the war,
which in the late summer
of 1940,
was looking
most extremely black."
Hedy said that she did not feel
comfortable
sitting there in Hollywood
and making lots of money
when things were
in such a state,
and that she was thinking
seriously of quitting MGM
and going to Washington D.C.
to offer her services
to the newly established
Inventors Council.
She was very patriotic,
she loved America.
She was grateful to be here,
and she wanted Hitler dead.
So did George Antheil.
George had a kid brother
12 years younger
whose name was Henry.
1941, he boarded a plane,
and moments later,
the plane was shot down
by two Soviet fighters.
This is the first American
killed in World War Il.
George, he was just devastated.
He wanted revenge
for his brother's assassination
and opportunity
with someone who knew
what she was talking about.
Hedy and George worked
on three inventions together,
all weapons meant to help
the Allies fight Germany.
I have letters
from George Antheil.
In one of the letters, he wrote,
"All she wants to do
is stay home and invent things.
She is an incredible combination
of childish ignorance
and definite flashes of genius."
"She calls
in the middle of the night
because an idea hit her."
So, my mother was a pest.
She had to invent,
she had to invent,
and she pulled George Antheil
in with her.
The most successful
of their inventions
was a secret
communication system
based on Hedy's idea
of frequency hopping.
George is taking
all these notes,
and I think there was
some sort of a-ha moment
where he said,
"You know, I have this system,"
I guess he got from dealing
with player pianos,
"that we might be able to adapt
and make... make
your concept work."
George Antheil got thrown
out of Trenton High School
when he was 17,
so he had no special training
in engineering.
What he did know was how
to synchronize player pianos.
George's
most famous composition
was for a film called
Ballet Mécanique.
He scored it
for 16 player pianos.
George's big realization was,
if piano rolls
can activate piano keys,
why couldn't they activate
radio frequencies
in both torpedo and the ship?
The basic idea
is that by using
two miniature piano rolls
that would start
at the same moment
and turn at the same speed,
a ship and a torpedo
could secretly communicate
on the same pattern
of frequencies.
Ultimately, Hedy and George
wanted their torpedo and ship
to communicate
on 88 different frequencies,
like an encryption system,
basically,
that nobody could crack.
Wonderfully clever idea.
And the Inventors Council
agreed.
The members of the National
Inventors Council...
And it was a council
of actual engineers
with a major inventor
in his own right,
Charles Kettering,
who was struck by the value
and the originality
of Hedy and George's idea.
So they helped George and Hedy
by connecting them up
with a physicist at Caltech
in California who was
an expert on electronics.
And he presumably designed
the electronics part
of this device.
The day came
when this invention
was issued a full patent.
Hedy and George
donated their invention
to the National Inventors
Council,
but it was generally understood
that if the military
used an invention,
the inventors would be paid.
They gave it to the Navy,
and as George Antheil
liked to tell the story later,
I went in to see the Navy Brass
and they threw the patent
on the desk and said,
"What do you want to do,
put a player piano in a torpedo?
Get out of here!"
And that was that.
Sons of bitches.
Shame.
Shame on them.
Well, that's why
I was in the Army,
because the Navy
was never that bright.
After the Navy
rejected their invention,
Hedy wanted to continue
developing it.
But George,
who always had bills to pay,
wasn't interested.
I think George was very proud
that he had done it,
but I think he just got over it.
I think that for Hedy,
she saw it as perhaps
her ticket to be recognized
for the brilliant woman
that she was.
And the patent, like all things
submitted to the military,
was put in a safe somewhere
and labeled Top Secret.
So it disappeared from the world
for the rest of the war.
The Navy basically told her,
"You know, you'd be helping
the war a lot more, little lady,
if you got out
and sold war bonds
rather than sat around
trying to invent
new kinds of torpedoes.
Leave that to the experts.
Get out there
and raise money."
You don't get to be
Hedy Lamarr and smart.
No.
No.
I worked for the government
at the bond tour.
Really? How?
By appearing,
by dancing with these people.
Hedy used to go
to the Hollywood Canteen
and entertain the troops.
Hedy Lamarr
hands out autographs.
She was not yet
an American citizen
and she was there working
on behalf of the United States
and its soldiers every night
as often as she could be.
It's a great thing, really.
Hedy sold something like
$25 million worth of war bonds,
which if you translate that
into modern dollars,
comes out around $343 million
worth of war bonds.
To be told to just raise money
for the war,
it's unfortunate.
That was the way that people
thought that she would do good
in the best way within
her realm of capabilities.
F-35, somebody have it?
I've got it!
Go ahead!
Oh no.
Like, go and sell a kiss
to a strange man.
Maybe... maybe she would have felt
a little bit better
about her accomplishments
if she received recognition
for her intellect.
Oh, you'll get used to it.
I don't want to get used to it.
I have my own life.
My own life!
To add insult to injury,
the U.S. Government seized
Hedy's patent in 1942
as the property
of an enemy alien.
I don't understand.
They use me for selling bonds,
then I'm not an alien.
And when I invent something
for this country
I am an alien?
I am Tandelayo.
After she did the invention,
what did Louis B. Mayer
offer Hedy Lamarr?
White Cargo.
We were at war by then
and Louis B. Mayer
wanted to entertain
the servicemen
who would pay money
to see what was considered
a dirty picture.
Louis B. Mayer
divided the world
into two kinds of women,
Madonna and whore.
I don't think he ever believed
she was anything but the latter
because of Ecstasy.
You better go now.
Audiences ate it up.
This was a woman who had tried
to change the course of the war.
Now she found herself
in a third rate film
as a distraction
for the troops.
They think I'm a bad actress.
I think sometimes in life
I act more than on the screen.
Hedy really struggled
to make her mark in Hollywood.
She knew she wasn't respected
like a Garbo or a Dietrich.
She wanted to have roles that
allowed her to do something more
and to give her
an acting challenge.
So that brought her in some
conflict with Louis B. Mayer.
He sued her a couple times.
I mean, he tried to keep her
on a very tight leash.
She wouldn't let herself
be kept on a tight leash
and there were always problems.
And she got the reputation
of being difficult.
I believe that we are
controlled by ourselves,
by our way of thinking,
by our way
of dealing with people.
I mean, there comes a point
when you can't take anymore...
then you have to
make yourself heard.
She needed to be free.
I think she was brave
and courageous.
She felt like,
"I'm gonna do it for myself.
I'm gonna live the way...
I bloody wanna live
my own life."
So she said,
"Well, you know what?
I'll make my own movie.
I'll produce my own movie."
I don't really recall
anybody except Hedy
went out and actually
produced a movie.
It was very unusual in 1946.
The system didn't welcome it,
they didn't want movie stars
going out of control
and producing their own films.
What a terrible idea.
Especially the women.
She was so ahead of her time
with being a feminist.
She's never been called that,
but she certainly was.
Don't worry about me.
I can handle trouble.
I know you can.
And then she co-produced
Dishonored Lady,
and I think that both films
were produced very well.
She made Dishonored Lady
with my father.
It's the only movie
they were in together.
I've always wondered
if it were possible for people
like you and me.
This was a time
when America was recovering
from World War Il.
And like the rest
of the country,
she too wanted a family
and a home life.
I was married
and married because
I liked the companionship
of a man, obviously.
I think, you know, he was quite
a bit older and British.
I don't think he was
the love of her life.
I think she had said
he was stuffy and boring.
You know, you're not
at all what I imagined.
No?
No.
So this is a letter
from George Antheil.
"The last time I saw Hedy,
she looked paler.
Something's troubling her.
John Loder is really
and honestly too dull
for this sparkling
and unbelievable diamond."
And I think he hit the nail
on the head with that one.
She was independent,
she was the breadwinner.
She wasn't stuck
in a marriage.
Will you please go?
Of course I'll go.
I think he left, I was a toddler
and Tony was a baby,
and I never heard from him.
She was a single mother
in the '40s,
so she was basically alone.
When we were little,
she was the most charming,
lovely person I can imagine.
And so nice
and warm and loving,
and she opened my hands
that were held in a ball,
"Relax, don't go
to sleep angry."
She was just
such a great mother.
I taught my children swimming.
The little children have
little armbands to swim.
- Have you ever seen that?
- Yes.
Makes absolutely no sense.
because the middle,
the center
is where they should be lifted.
Mm-hm.
That's how I taught
my children
and they swim like fish.
They really were good as gold.
I did a good job with them.
It made me a little tired
but that's...
that's part of it, the job,
I guess.
My mother worked her ass off.
She had to earn a living.
She was on her own.
It was such pressure.
At least she didn't have
to worry about granny.
By then she'd made it
safely to California
and Mom paid for her
to live nearby.
Financially, Hedy wasn't
in the best of shape.
She had two independent films,
she made a lousy comedy,
and she knew she was going
in the gutter career-wise.
She needed a breath
of fresh air.
And just by a stroke of luck,
her agent at the time mentioned,
"Well, I was talking
to C.B. the other day,"
Cecil B. DeMille,
great motion picture producer.
He was just beginning
his biblical epics
of sex and sand.
And Hedy called Cecil B. DeMille
and said,
"I understand you're casting
for a new motion picture.
I am Delilah."
No man leaves Delilah.
Look at her, Samson.
Look well.
Satan himself taught her
all the arts of deception.
Howard Hawks had a great line
about DeMille.
He says, "You know,
DeMille is so bad
he's almost good."
But anyway, Samson and Delilah
was a huge hit.
I think it was
her biggest success.
It thoroughly
revived Hedy's name
into the public consciousness.
Samson and Delilah was
the second highest grossing film
of the decade.
Only Gone with the Wind
surpassed it.
Hedy took notice.
She decided to produce
her own epic
in the style of DeMille.
She would film it in Italy
and title it
The Loves of Three Queens.
Hedy played
all three lead roles.
The subject was beauty
and how it got
in the way of love
for the great women of history.
They're leading you into a trap.
Oh, Napoleon, you're blind.
There is no choice.
It was a huge production.
She didn't have the training
to take on a project
of this size.
And when she was finished
with it,
she couldn't find distribution
in the United States.
She spent millions
of dollars on it,
no one would touch it.
She lost all her money.
She found herself with nothing.
I'm a good artist
and a very bad business person.
She's no longer a star
and she doesn't really have
any money.
She was in Houston for an event
and she ran into Howard Lee
the oil man.
And then I found out
my name was now Tony Lee.
And we were living in Texas.
Mom actually had a Texas twang
with a Viennese accent.
It was hilarious.
He was a nice guy.
I really kind of felt Texan
for a while.
In Texas, Hedy found herself
a trophy wife again.
You know, Texas was retirement.
But a creative person
needs something to do.
She didn't have much to do.
We went on vacation
in Aspen, Colorado.
I used to ski
when I was a young girl.
I skied to school,
I skied all over the place.
And I went through Aspen.
There was nobody there.
Nothing.
Just a little store
and a few houses.
And they said, "This could be a
very wonderful skiing resort."
So I started to build
a place called Villa Lamarr.
She wanted to build
a ski resort,
so she convinced Howard
to buy some land.
It was all Austrian,
it's beautiful.
She spent years
making that place.
She created some
of her homeland.
That's why it meant
a lot to her.
She was really,
I think, homesick.
It was after that
that everything
started falling apart.
Their relationship wasn't good.
It was pretty traumatic;
he was an alcoholic.
With children it was very
difficult so I walked away.
I said, "All I want is Aspen,"
which I built myself.
My chalet there which makes
a million a day,
I suppose, now.
Hedy told me again and again
about her divorce
with Howard Lee.
May be the darkest time
in her life.
And then my daughter said,
"Ma, something happened
to Tony."
My son was almost killed
in a car accident.
While her son was
in the hospital near death,
Hedy was called to testify
in divorce court.
Stressed and traumatized
to the point of breakdown,
she sent
her Hollywood body double
to testify in her place.
She infuriated the judge,
who punished her
by cutting her share
of the divorce settlement.
He took everything away.
Aspen, which was beautiful.
I mean, it was a big shock.
So with the pressure here
and pressure all over
that's all I needed.
So I collapsed.
I had a nervous breakdown.
I feel like I was dead for...
I don't know how long,
but I was dead.
And so much so that this light
you see really exists
on the ceiling.
I saw my father.
She said Emil, her father,
was her greatest love,
or no one could compare to him.
Well, he knew her
before she was this celebrity.
And so she felt
real love there.
And I don't know
if she felt that again.
Hedy had two more husbands
in her life.
Neither marriage lasted
much more than a year.
I wish my mother had a husband
who knew how to love her.
But she never did.
When I ended up living
with her after Texas,
it was very, very tricky,
very hard.
I think the drugs
were very responsible.
The slightest thing could...
could set her off.
There was erratic behavior.
She was becoming more unstable.
I guess it pretty much
started with Jimmy.
As an adult,
I was looking at baby pictures
and it was my first birthday
with my mom...
and mother and father behind me.
And in between them, a boy.
Um, I told Mom,
"Who's this boy?"
And she literally said,
"Oh, it was an adoption
that didn't work out."
She told me that
he was really rebellious
and was acting out big time.
And Jimmy was put
in a military boarding school.
So the sports coach
kind of took Jimmy
under his wing,
coach and the wife,
and he asked Hedy
if he could live with them.
And Mom was apparently so hurt
she said yes.
And I can't believe
that I have no memory of him.
She's my mother and I love her.
I called her sometimes
and she called me sometimes.
I never really blamed her
for anything,
I... I just...
I knew she was upset
because I, you know,
kind of like slapped her
in the face.
Like saying,
"I don't love you anymore."
But still I never saw her
after that for 40-some years.
She was a woman of extremes.
I mean, Hedy can just
leave things behind.
She cut off Jimmy,
she cut off being Jewish.
She was broken, she was
missing pieces of herself.
A lot of stars
from the studio system
did carry over this addiction
to pep pills, speed.
It does explain, in hindsight,
a lot of her behavior.
There are always
a great many rumors
about her connection
to the famous Dr. Feelgood.
Dr. Feelgood was Max Jacobson.
Look at
the Aretha Franklin song,
"Oh, Dr. Feelgood,
please make me feel good."
Everybody called him
Dr. Feelgood
because he made them
feel good.
When Cecil B. DeMille
had his heart attack
on the set
of The Ten Commandments,
he flew Dr. Max over.
And then DeMille said,
"Go inject Charlton Heston.
There's not enough energy.
His Moses is too lackadaisical."
Hedy Lamarr
became a patient of his
from the 1950s
until Max Jacobson
lost his medical license
in 1974.
Somebody did me in
like many times
and gave me a shot.
I don't know what it was.
I thought it was vitamins
but it wasn't.
Said, "Oh, you should try
these vitamin B shots.
They give you so much energy."
What Max Jacobson said
is they were
special vitamin elixirs.
And he loaded up a vial
with 40 milligrams
of methamphetamine.
Meth was legal.
And he gave Hedy a shot.
And the thing
about methamphetamine
is once you get
a couple of shots,
you're hooked
because the brain will demand
more and more of that reward.
So she got hooked
on these "vitamins."
And they turned her
into a monster.
I was standing in the kitchen
and she was holding a fork
and she dropped it.
And all of a sudden
she just hauls up and, bam,
smashes me across the face.
"Whenever I drop something,
you pick it up!"
You know,
she was just out of control.
Now I can be forgiving
for all that erratic behavior
because in a way
she was a victim
of the very system
that made her famous.
Thank you very much.
Howdy-hi, Shindiggers.
I'm Jimmy O'Neill and tonight
it's my great pleasure
to introduce the beautiful
Ms. Hedy Lamarr.
Of course anyone growing up
in Hollywood in the early '60s
was aware of her
as the kind of caricature
of herself that she had become.
Lucille Ball, I remember,
used to do an outrageous
takeoff of Tandelayo.
I am Tandelayo.
I think it was offensive to her.
She didn't want to be a joke.
Mom was not in a good...
good way
when I was away at college.
I remember one day
walking to school at Cal,
with my books,
and I walked past a newsstand
and there's a picture
of Mom in jail.
Mrs. Lamarr was shopping
at the May Company
Department Store
and evidently was arrested
by one of the security personnel
of the store.
And it was apparent that she had
something like
approximately $14,000 on her,
but she had still taken
about $80 worth of merchandise.
When you see that
on the front page,
it's like you want
to just crawl in a hole.
The defendant
is quoted as saying,
"I didn't mean
to steal anything.
I'll be glad to pay
for the items.
I have the money."
She was acquitted for that.
She said it was
a misunderstanding.
Who knows?
You know, a lot of people
handle stress in different ways.
It was a shock.
She was such a big star.
She seemed so untouchable
to be reduced to that.
And I think that
most people thought
it must be a kind
of mental illness.
I want to see the store manager.
No.
I want to see the store manager.
You're not seeing
the store manager.
Andy Warhol's
school of filmmaking
makes a film that is very
obviously lampooning her image.
And she becomes,
essentially, a punch line.
The shoplifting also resulted
in her inability
to play her final role.
She was signed to do
Picture Mommy Dead
and Zsa Zsa Gabor
stepped in to replace her.
They just fired me.
- Were you shocked?
- No.
I'm not shocked at that, no.
This is gonna go
into your book, I trust.
Oh, yes, indeed.
What's the name of that book?
The longer I wait,
the better the book gets.
Somebody suggested
doing her autobiography,
that she should do it.
She had no interest
in the book itself,
but she wanted
the money from it.
There really hadn't been
any sort of scandalous tell-all.
She spoke with ghostwriters
for many, many hours
about her past,
and then they translated
her memories
into a narrative.
I think her business manager
was paid off
to get all this stuff past her.
And she didn't want to deal
with paperwork,
so she just trusted him.
Your book,
called Ecstasy and Me...
Don't talk about that.
That's not my book.
- You wrote it.
- No.
Did that hurt your image
in Hollywood?
I don't know what is an image.
I mean,
what's your image, Woody?
What's my im... same as yours.
Okay, now you want me
to tell you what your image is?
- Yeah.
- It's a glamorous,
beautiful,
internationally known star
who obviously rides
in limousines
and has great jewels
and you don't scrub
your kitchen floors.
I don't like that, no,
but tell me more.
I never lived that way.
Isn't that what it's all about?
No, not to me.
I guess in the image it is.
She was known for her glamour
and her beauty.
It was impossible to live up to
as she got older.
She would see that
and you knew
that it disturbed her.
She started having
plastic surgery in her 40s.
One of her plastic surgeons
told me once
that she was a groundbreaker
even in plastic surgery
where she came up with ideas.
She said, "My arms are crepey
and I want you to cut here
right in the line of the fold
and I want you to get rid
of the excess skin
and leave the scar here.
Leave the scar on my knee,
behind my knee.
Put the scar behind my ear.
And they did it
and the surgeons said, you know,
"A lot of these things she did
we were never doing before."
You'll mention her
to an older plastic surgeon
and they remember their...
all their actresses
coming in saying,
"You know, well, Hedy,
she had this done.
Can I get this done too?"
She was really one of the first
women out there saying,
"Why isn't this possible?
Why can't we do this?"
She looked wonderful
for her age,
but all of that didn't work
because people still wanted
that old image of Hedy Lamarr.
You know, the only thing
that would have...
that would have solved
the problem
is if she'd died young.
People were cruel to her.
People would come up and say,
"You were so beautiful."
The press was mean.
I said, "Oh, Mom,
I feel I really have empathy
for that pressure on you."
So no wonder
she kind of hid away.
Do you think
you are unsociable?
Me? No!
Have I been reserved with you?
No, I mean are you unsociable
here in America?
I only know that they
do not understand me.
How can you understand
a person who
has had as many phases
in life as I have?
I have been through a lot,
my whole life.
You start to think,
"I have experienced
everything now in life."
"Now I want peace."
I miss Vienna.
I would like to make
a movie about it.
What would the movie look like?
All of the nice things
I have seen when I was a child.
The opera.
The Spanish Riding School.
Schönbrunn Palace.
My school in Döbling.
Whatever, I don't know.
I am always Austrian.
We met in person
two times in my life.
She would send me
autographed pictures of herself,
you know,
which they're mostly like
those studio prints.
Even though she says
it was a curse,
that's what people liked
and loved about her and she...
for some reason I think
she thought even her family,
her grandchildren,
her children want that.
She did a lot of sadly
not so good plastic surgery
in her later years,
each one fixing the flaws
of the last.
And she no longer
went out in public.
And then the money
started running out
because she only got something
from Screen Actors Guild
and Social Security.
All they give me $300.
Per month?
Yep.
That's not much, is it?
No, it's not very much.
Have you ever tried to get... uh
some recompense...
for your idea?
...the patent?
No.
I was surprised that they
don't even acknowledge it.
In 1969, Hedy had written
to a friend in the Navy
asking if he could find out
what happened to her patent.
"Laura Slainier,
Washington Patent Office,
has an invention of mine,
a missile-guided torpedo.
Maybe you can get it."
So this was important to her.
His reply has been lost,
but she probably learned
that her idea,
frequency hopping,
had been put to use
in military communications.
By the time
of the Cuban Missile Crisis,
when President Kennedy
sent Navy ships
to blockade Cuba,
the ships that were running
the blockade
were all equipped
with frequency-hopped radios.
When she found out
that the patent was used,
she thought, "Hey, I should be
making some money from this."
I mean, isn't that normal
to get something?
Yes, it is.
Well... apparently
they didn't think so.
Well, it has to do
with the nature of patent law.
I think that it wasn't
actually used
during the life
of the patent
and it was only after
the patent expired
that it went into common use.
I don't think so.
They used it before!
For Hedy to be paid,
the Navy had to use her patent
before it expired in 1959.
And there's evidence they did
give it to a contractor.
Romuald Scibor sent me an email.
And he said, 19...
it was about '55,
he said he was handed
that patent.
And they were tasked
to create a sonobuoy.
A sonobuoy is a floating
submarine detection device.
Someone in the Navy
found the patent and thought,
"Well, I don't know
if there's anything here,
but let's toss it
to a contractor."
And he took that patent
and used it
as the basis for communications
from the sonobuoy in the water
to a passing naval airplane
that would also be secure.
The inventor
of the sonobuoy had a website
where he paid tribute
to the Markey-Antheil invention.
Will you take a look?
Sure.
A Tribute to Hedy Lamarr
by Romuald Scibor-Marchocki.
No, I haven't seen this.
"I designed the sonobuoy,
one of the first deployments
of frequency hopping."
And he goes on to write
about surveillance drones
at Aerojet-General.
"I was the systems manager
building the surveillance drone
which eventually
flew over Vietnam.
I personally designed
the reliable and secure
two-way radio
communications system.
For the first time,
we had the ability
to switch frequencies rapidly.
Now that I know who invented
frequency hopping,
I, who was the only person
who remembers
those early applications
of this concept,
want to express
my sincere admiration
and belated thanks
to Hedy Lamarr."
How 'bout them apples?
She should have gotten paid.
What would you have
the government do to repay you?
At this point
I don't even care.
There she is.
The Tyrolean beauty.
Toward the end of Hedy's life
she began to reflect.
She began to have insight.
Well, things don't always
work... straight forward.
They have detours sometimes.
That's part of living.
Yep.
I didn't expect that I'd come
here and fall apart either
but things happen.
She always talked about
writing her autobiography
and wanting to get
the story out
about who the real
Hedy Lamarr was,
not the Hedy Lamarr
in the movies,
which I think she often thought
movies were really trivial.
Now I'm becoming smart
all of a sudden.
Better late than never, right?
Absolutely.
Maybe someday
I'll become smart too.
I gave you a little lesson
there right now.
Yes ma'am.
I guess I should let you...
I guess you should.
...let you go, but...
I enjoyed talking.
I enjoyed talking to you
and perhaps I'll...
Maybe you can do some good.
I hope so.
The article I wrote,
I like to think that
that was really a part
of how she gained recognition.
So Forbes magazine,
May 1990,
this is the first time
the mainstream press
released the information
that Hedy was glamorous, yes,
stupid, no.
I called her and said, you know,
"Mom, people are interested
in what you thought of
back in '42."
She said, "It's about time."
The first to pick up
Hedy's story
were people
in the communications industry
because they realized
frequency hopping
was revolutionary.
It was already finding
its way into GPS,
Wi-Fi technology, Bluetooth,
and billion-dollar
military satellites.
Five, four, three,
Atlas engine ignition,
one, zero,
and liftoff
of Lockheed Martin...
The Milstar
satellite system provides
protected, secure communications
for the President
of the United States
and high priority
military users.
The work that Hedy Lamarr did
in her patent,
Milstar took that technology
in order to implement
frequency hopping
on the system.
And that's what we trust
our most important
nuclear command
and control messages with.
The Navy, Milstar,
and Lockheed Martin
actually gave Hedy an award
thanking her for coming up
with her idea.
And when I called her, I said,
"Mom, they're gonna give you
an award,"
but she just didn't want
to be seen.
The award I'm about to present
is in recognition
of a famous actress
turned inventor,
Hedy Lamarr.
I gave a talk
to about 800 people.
But right in the middle of it...
If I have seen farther...
Oh, my God.
Are you serious?
My mother's here too.
I'll tell you
a little bit later.
Hello?
How did it go?
I'm in the middle of it.
I just said, "Mom,
if you could say something,
what would you say?"
And this is what she said.
I'm happy that this invention
has been so successful.
I appreciate your
acknowledgement
of you honoring me
and that it was not done
in vain.
Thank you.
Perfect.
- Okay?
- Okay.
I love you!
Love you too.
Bye.
And they all stood up
and clapped.
I thought it was really great.
She would love to be remembered
as someone who contributed
to the well-being of humankind.
She did make her mark.
It's the one thing
she did for other people
that she's gonna be long,
long remembered for.
It was New Year's,
January 1st, 2000.
She called my sister and I
separately,
"Turn on the TV!
It's Vienna, Vienna!
You'll see Vienna!"
And so we turn on the TV
and the Viennese
Symphony Orchestra
was playing on TV.
She died a few days later.
She fell asleep
and she just didn't wake up.
I'll read you something pretty.
People are unreasonable,
illogical, and self-centered.
Love them anyway.
If you do good,
people will accuse you
of selfish alternative motives.
Do good anyway.
The biggest people
with the biggest ideas
can be shot down
by the smallest people
with the smallest minds.
Think big anyway.
What you spend years building
may be destroyed overnight.
Build anyway.
Give the world
the best you have
and you'll be kicked
into the teeth.
Give the world
the best you've got anyway.
