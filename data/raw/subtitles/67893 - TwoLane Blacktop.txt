Watch the fight.
There
That Plymouth has a Hemi
with a Torqueflite.
I believe we sawed the guy off
even if we did lose 200.
-What do you need?
- Gas
- Wanna fill it up ?
- Yeah.
Where is the gas tank?
- Motor Chevy ?
- Yes.
It look like an awful lot of work.
396 ?
- 454.
- No shit ?
- Kind of transmission ?
- 4 gears.
- You build the headers ?
- Yeah.
How fast will she run?
It depends on who's around.
Is there something fast around here?
Got a Thames panel truck.
It's got a little bit of transmission
trouble right now though.
Probably blow our doors right off,
wouldn't it ?
Hello, there
This is radio station
of Arizona.
It's really bumpy back here.
What kind of car is this, anyway ?
You guys aren't the Zodiac killers
or anything like that, are you ?
Jest passing through.
L.P.'s truck was worse.
Wouldn't even be up in the morning
unless he would want to smoke up a joint.
We were supposed to go to the Grand Canyon
but he kept getting stoned and pulling off the side of the road.
Say, which way are we going ?
East.
That's cool. I never been east.
She don't seem
to be breathing right.
Might be the jets.
Don't you race him ?
Isn't that you guys do ?
I mean, didn't a car just come up
and challenge you ?
It's too heavy to do
in a Porsche just for kicks.
We'd take him in a quarter mile
but he'd probably lose us in the long time.
How much bread we got ?
We got three hundred racing bread.
Twenty to spend.
Do you have some change ?
I have to take the bus to San Fransisco.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me sir, 
i'm trying to catch the bus to San Francisco.
- I got sick and I...
- Good luck to you.
Excuse me, sir. I'm trying to get
the bus back to San Francisco.
I got sick and had to use up
the allowance my parents gave me. I ought to get back.
I need some money to catch the bus.
Excuse me, sir. I'm trying to get
the bus back to San Francisco, can you help me out ?
- Do you need money ?
- Some change, i'll take it.
Well...
I'm trying to catch
the bus back to San Francisco.
You're gonna need a lot.
Can you wait till Monday ?
A 70 Camaro.
A 68 Baracuda.
There's a Roadrunner
with a hemi unit.
A 70 Cuda.
They got some muscle here tonight.
Ol 55.
Listen all we gotta do
is rope one (out).
I think it's spotted, sometime.
It's a 32 Ford.
It's got a 437 in it.
Those are carter carburators.
Eleven inches of rubber in the rear.
Clean machine.
Just clean enough.
Not bad for old broads.
It's a little more than that, sonny.
See, you must have something
real special, here.
Gee, mister.
I bet it's pretty quick.
You wanna find out ?
Well, ordinarily I jump
at the opportunity,
but the thing is
I'm just not in the habit of seeing
a Chevy work against some two-bit piece of junk.
- Let's make it fifty.
- Make it three yards, motherfucker.
We'll have an automobile race.
Hey, this guy just bet three hundred bucks.
- Where ?
- Airport road. You cn follow me.
I'll walk to the motel.
* to have a * glass and a beer please.
[suppr]
Now I can't do it anymore.
I get upset now, you upset me and I get angry.
Well, don't do it.
Let me have a double scotch
* twist and a beer.
- You wanna use me and I'm tired of that.
- I'm not gonna deal with that, baby.
Everytime I hit you where it hurts,
you don't wanna deal with it.
I want a response from you and don't you withdraw from me
because everytime I need you, you withdraw from me.
You don't need me, you need a lamppost
down in the street.
If I walk out of you tonight,
I'm walking out.
- You're out of your fucking tree.
- Fuck you !
- Where are you going ?
- Amarillo.
Well you're in luck.
...
God Almighty, mister !
She's got a hard pull, doesn't she ?
Zero to sixty in 6.5.
She'll do a quarter mile in 13.40.
- Performance and image. That's what it's all about.
- It's a mighty fancy automobile.
I bought her in Bakersfield, California.
I was testing jets at the time
and it got so I bad to have
more action on the ground. You know what I mean ?
I mean you just can't
stay with the same high forever.
So when the 455 came out with
the Mach IV Ram-Air and the beefed lower end,
a carter high-riser setup, I was on line.
390 horsepower,
500 foot pounds of torque.
Whatever that is, it's all in the folder right there,
in the glove compartment. Take a look at it.
- She's a real Road King, all right.
- How come you ain't still in Bakersfield ?
Because I'm in the southwest.
- What kind of sound do you like ?
- I beg your pardon ?
Rock, Soul, Hillbillie ?
Western ?
- What;s your taste?
- It ain't no hard matter to me.
It might be a fouled plug.
Wish we were back in Santa Fe.
So after I got shot down
twice over Korea,
I decided it was time
for some fun and games.
A couple years off,
you know what I mean ?
When I ran out of cash,
I had to take a job testing jets.
Only for a while, huh.
It got so I needed
little more action on the ground.
I mean you can't stay
with the same high forever, right ?
About that time, the 455 came out
with the Mach-IV Ram-Air,
the beefed lower...
Those sons of bitches.
They've been following me
clear across two states...
Three states.
They keep wanting to challenge me.
They come up behind me and honk,
when I keep my cool.
I don't get into it with 'em,
they get hysterical.
They're just a bunch
of small-town car freaks. That's all they are.
But I'll tell you one thing, mister.
They'd run right over you
if they get the chance.
It's homemade stuff.
They can't stand up
to a 455, no way.
Shit. I'd run off
with them in 20 minutes.
Color me gone, baby !
Why can't I sit
at the front ?
What is this, anyway ?
Some kind of masculine power trip ?
I'm shut back here
with these goddamn tools.
Screwdrivers and wrenches don't make 
it for me, you know.
We had to get *.
We'll need * to do a little work on the carburator
and check out the rear end.
I don't see anybody
paying attention to my rear end !
Listen. I've got to take a lick.
Will you stop this car.
Put her flat out for a while.
Good morning !
- Do I check the oil, sir ?
- Yeah.
- Good morning !
- Morning, we'll need a ...
It's not in there. 
- I don't check the oil ?
- No.
I don't like being crowded by a couple
of punk-road almost clear across two states.
I don't.
I don't believe I've ever seen you.
Cause there's lots of cars
on the road like yours.
They all get to lookin' the same.
People from about the same.
If I wanted to bother,
I could suck you right out my tail pipe.
Sure you could.
[suppr]
Thanks, mister.
Wait till come back.
You hear those cicadas ?
Yeah.
You talk about survivor men.
not about some freaky bugs.
They come out of the ground
every seven years.
And they live on the ground the rest of the time
and the only time they come on the ground is to
fall out of their skins
and grow some wings so they can fuck.
And then they die.
But before they die,
they managed to lay some eggs...
We got a bad life, haven't we ?
- You make them sick.
- Oh boy, I'd say.*
Well, don't get any splinters.
You bore me.
These are groovy records.
Play one.
You travel with those guys ?
Yeah.
Say where do you such a far-out car.
Vegas. I won it shootin' craps.
I thought I'd drive to New York
and spend some money.
I don't care.
I'm just gonna hang there.
How fast that car go ?
I don't know.
Pretty fast.
I can take him.
I know I can take that antique.
How are you doing ?
Fine.
Better.
I think we got us a squirrel to run.
- You got nothing that interests a bunch of strangers?
- We race.
Sure, we race.
You're damn right, we race.
For pinks.
Pink slips.
You mean, for cars ?
The whole race for the all shot.
That's right : al for teh rolling star.
Where to ?
You name it.
In that case, smart ass, Washington D.C.
Right, Washington D.C.
Just second run.
I know you're on.
You're definitely on.
- I was going there, anyway.
- Show him how to do it.
You put the pinks in an envelop
and send it to DC general deliver.
First winner waits for his car.
I'll do that. I've done it before.
- How much do you owe you ?
- 8.50 $.
Wait till come back.
To stay in the country road,
...that way
Never say you race,
they'd bust you for it.
No way, baby.
They ain't gonna see me.
...
...
Turn that shit off.
- What ?
- Turn it off, it gets in the way.
We had some good sleep, last night.
At least the way as I did. 
We could be better for a long race.
All that sweet stuff and coke'll
get to you when come night.
- How are your eyes ?
- Good, it all feels good.
I figure we can go straight trough.
Three or four stops for gas.
Eat light.
It's best to keep the hunger on.
I'll relieve you in 6 hours.
I feel good, I can take it all the way.
- There's a lot of muscles jumping around in your neck.
- I like it that way.
It's gonna rain.
He'd better find himself
a relief driver or he's in trouble.
Unless he has somme uppers.
It's a real pretty car.
My cousin used to have one of these,
to go with it.
It's a test car.
I'm driving to test now,
as a matter of fact.
Racing that Chevy cross-country.
If I win, there could be
millions for The Organisation. 
- How far you go ?
- Oklahoma City.
- You ever been there ?
- No, never been there.
Do you mind if I stretch out ?
- Make myself comfortable ?
- No, go right ahead.
Don't do that !
I just thought it might relax you
while you drive.
This is competition, man.
I got no time.
Hey, sweetheart.
Come on !
He's gotta get on it.
Son of a bitch! You would have left me,
wouldn't you?
- Get your ass out of here.
- It's raining. You can't let me out here.
Out !
I told you to keep close of me.
Come on. How was I supposed to know ?
We can still be... friends, can't we ?
Out.
I ain't moving.
First town we come to,
you're out.
I've got no time for sidetracks !
I'm gonna change
the jets on the carburator.
Get me a cheesburger
with everything on it,
and a coke.
[suppr]
[suppr]
One step back over here from me.
[suppr]
[suppr]
Can I help you ?
Yeah. This man's dangerous, officer.
He passes on the right,
a couple of miles back.
I swear he was going about 90.
One step back over here from me.
Did he pass you on the ditch ?
That's right.
He was weaving all over the road.
Scared my wife out half to dead.
He must be on something.
Do you need me as a witness
or anything like that ?
No, mister.
I believe we can handle it.
I didn't pass him...
- Hey, man.
- Listen you, creep.
I don't need any help, you understand.
I'm in this race all the way
and I don't need to be patronized.
Don't put me on !
I've been around a track
too many times. You understand ?
We just wanted to let you know
that we were right along with you on the road.
We're all in this together, right ?
Look, shit-for-brains.
I had those cops
even right on my exhaust pipe.
You blew the whole thing.
I had a police escort quarter
cross the state line
because my wife had set up twins.
That's beautiful.
Just don't fuck around with me.
Okay, why don't we take
a truce for a few minutes.
Would you like
a hard-boiled egg or something ?
Here.
I've got other items,
depends on which way you wanna go.
Up, down or sideways ?
- Here's to you destruction.
- Same to you.
You want another egg ?
Well, here we are on the road ?
Yeah, that's where we are all right.
I'm not worried about
shotting you down. I hope you know that.
Yeah, I figured as much.
However, I have been around.
I get into this country and I bounced off
like a rubber ball and hit right back to the other side.
I've been scouting locations
for downhole movie on fast cars.
But the real race,
it's more interesting.
I could choose locations
that I go along.
You've been doing this much ?
A little, yeah .
I knew you were a car nut,
like a spud type.
All that speed is gonna run over you,
one of these days.
You can't be a nomad forever.
Unless you flow with it, like me.
Now, you take a trip up to...
Listen why don't you ride with me ?
They're not for you.
All they think about is cars.
They can't assure you
the same kind I can.
Where would we go ?
Miami.
Maybe, Montreal.
Mexico, on the other side.
The thing is you got to keep moving.
Few dashes out of country and
you never know.
You got to have a foreign taste
just to keep balanced otherwise you fell apart.
I don't know.
Not right now.
Anyway, you 'll probably
lose the race.
I'm serious, you know ?
I'm not just kidding around.
You'd have yourself a real street-sweeper
here if you put a little work into it.
I go fast enough.
You can never go fast enough.
I'll tell you another thing.
You 'll never make it another 50 miles
the way the carburettor is.
You're licking gas
all over the engine.
What I got to do ?
Get a fix in the next town,
if they have the parts,
it won't take more than an hour.
That's all I need.
I can't survive forever.
It's all right for you, guys.
You've got a relief driver, change over.
But you ought to see what I'm picking up
on the road. One fantasy after another.
Look, we'll wait for you.
Doesn't interest me to be 500 miles ahead.
How the hell I know you'll wait ?
I'll go with you, man.
It's only 10 miles from here, next town.
- I'll go with you.
- I can go. I need a tape recorder.
No.
I'll ride this Chevy.
I never rode one of these things.
It's not too comfortable, in here.
Yeah!
Holy shit !
Come on, man. You can do it.
Pull out !
Come on.
What are you trying to do ?
Blow my mind ?
[suppr]
[suppr]
[suppr]
[suppr]
[suppr]
[suppr]
Everything fell apart on me.
My job, my family...everything.
I had this show with a television producer
and I walked in the office...
I don't wanna hear about it.
What do you mean,
you don't wanna hear about it ?
It's not my problem.
What do you do it for ?
I get nervous around this part of the country.
- You've seen her around ?
- Who ?
The girl. You know Higgins,
whatever her name is.
No. You know where
I can get a plate ?
I don't wanna be left out in the cold,
you know what I mean?
All right, let's try again.
Put it neutral.
The key. Start it.
That's right. Now, push the clutch.
Put on the first.
Oh, fuck it!
I can't do it.
Shut your eyes.
Now, this is first...
this is second.
Third, fourth.
I don't think you'll have to use it.
and reverse.
This is neutral.
Is this a game ?
I don't know.
Not yet.
You try.
You 're right. You can't do it.
I can do this.
It must be Saturday.
You'd better get your key altogether.
What's happening ?
His angle woke up .
I'll meet you on the Seven
on the dirt road.
Okay. Throw me my shirt.
Yes, sir. Can I help you ?
Yeah, I need a carburator rebuild kit
for a 1970 GM carter jet.
All right, sir.
I only got one, sir.
6.95$ plus tax.
[suppr]
You don't have to worry about it.
Did you fix my lick ?
- Yeah but that's artificial traction man. I can't let you do that.
- You mean your car ?
My car. That's a thing you get into,
you go from one place to another in a short time.
76-40
Thank you, Steve.
I'd just like to know one thing :
are we still racing or what ?
I've got speed to think about.
I'd like a hamburger and an alka seltzer.
We're broke.
- Broke, what do you mean ?
- No bread.
We gotta get some competition.
Oh, broke.
That's a problem.
Allie.
My buddies and I, we all wondered
where you all might be from.
We're passing through.
Passing through ?
Where do you wanna be by then ?
We're goin' to Tennessee.
Tennessee !
That's the piss poorest state I've ever seen.
Sir. I work for these boys,
I'm their manager.
We race that 55 Chevy
set outside.
We heard there's a good race
track up around Memphis.
They race in that Chevy out there.
We got one of the best track
in this part of the country.
Behind the state line.
Really!
Yeah, we got some boys,
who could shut you all down, no problem.
Ain't that right, boys ?
We 'll make it.
Be sure that you do.
Say you all wouldn't be...
hippies, would you ?
No, sir.
I take care of these boys myself.
They're hometown boys.
Saunder's married to Mary over there
and Davis is his brother.
We're a big family but we know
how to keep together, you know what I mean ?
Well, sure nice to talk to you. 
Sure to see you.
You all make damn car out here.
We'll do it.
One of them Dodge Chargers,
let him go by.
Not today.
Are you all right ?
I'm OK, I'm just scared.
His neck is broken.
He was trying to pass
this other car, you see.
He turn at the bad curve
at the wrong side of the road.
There was nothing I could do.
He just kept coming at me,
the damn fool.
The godamn fool !
I...
Wou, big fella.
Easy now. Nothing to be afraid of.
Appreciated.
No trouble.
Where are you going ?
East.
Well I can take you 200 miles.
I'm goin' up to Memphis
to run a few in my cars.
A couple of Cobras, a Camaro...
Sure do Ok.
It doesn't matter.
Beg your pardon.
What do we have ? 40 ? 50 years?
You don't exactly read me right.
It's not that I give a shit.
I do a little keep of my own.
I believe everything
that you say, man.
Listen. You don't have
to put me on.
I'm getting sick and tired of creeps
getting of the road and putting me on.
What you say ?
You said something.
You might as well go ahead and tell me what you said.
I said "Stop the car".
What do you mean "stop the car" ?
I mean take your foot off the gas
and pull over.
I just wanna get of this machine.
I pulled something in my neck.
But if that's all we got,
we're in good shape.
I gotta check the points in the valves
when we get there.
Also the jets in the carbs.
We're going to Palm Glove.
Ten mile on.
Going to the graveyard.
Glad to help you out, ma'am.
Going to the graveyard.
Her folks burried there.
Both of them.
Killed on saturday night.
Out estate.
Yes, madam.
I'm driving through the Florida.
I bought my mother a house
down in San Petersburg
and I wanna get down there
and fix it up before she gets there.
City car.
Well it could be a city car
or a country car, madam.
Folks all over have a car.
It was a city car that killed them.
I'm sorry ma'am.
It was a city car that killed them.
...
...
...
...
Wev'e tried cooler plugs and everything
and cooler plus are working on very well.
...
...
...
...
...
Don't forget,
it's the day of the record run.
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
Where to ?
Roll a block.
I think there's someone following us.
You'll get used to it.
Hurricane *.
Oh, I think he's setting up
a grocery over there somewhere.
He's crazy, man.
He won't even qualify.
Yeah, well he's been pretty weird lately.
See you all on on the beach.
Good luck.
We'll be in DC tomorrow night for dinner.
I set it up.
We're goin' against the Vette.
I put up the tools against three hundred.
I gotta check the valves.
She's running fine.
Beautiful !
After D.C., we're going down to Florida.
They've got some nice beaches down there.
...
...
...
I got a good lead on him.
They ain't gonna catch me now.
We'll take the pink
so we'll go to New York, right ?
Right.
That's right.
Problem under the hood.
I just cleared it.
Where is she ?
- They split.
- Let's go.
Don't matter, we don't want her to go anyway.
Come on.
Okay, she's gonna burn you.
Honey...
we've got time for a quick bite.
Then we'll go on.
Doesn't matter where.
As long as we got time
to grab off * every now and then.
Oh no.
Forget I said that
I'm crazy about you.
Here's the way it's gonna be.
When we get the Cobra,
we're gonna go to Florida.
we'll go around the beach 
and watch the stars.
Maybe we'll run over to Arizona.
Nights are warm.
And roads are straight.
And we'll build a house.
Yeah, we'll build a house.
Because If I'm not grounded pretty soon,
I'm gonna go into orbit.
Easy.
Take it easy, man
you're going to kill us.
Baby.
I'm gonna get some food,
I'm fallin' asleep.
No.
Food, breakfast.
Champagne, caviar...
Chicken sandwiches under glass.
No...
Bacon eggs, coffee, toast
And tea.
Maybe we oughta go to Chicago.
I got some connections in Chicago
that are outta sight.
I don't wanna go to Chicago.
That's cool, then.
We'll check out in New York.
We passed it five miles back.
Where ?
I said, where ?
It's gonna take a long time.
You'll have to pull over.
We're out of town
on the worng side of the road.
Shit !
I figured we were goin' up
to Colombus, Ohio.
There's a man there who's got
some pot wants to sell real cheap. 
No good.
This is a bitch of a car.
...
- What you've got here?
- That's for you to find out.
- 50 ?
- See ya.
- Make it a hundred
Where do you guys race around here ?
Oh, down there.
Fast little wheeled you have here. 
- How far you going ?
- NYC 
You're in luck.
I can take you all the way.
What you got ?
390 horse ?
Yeah, 390.
I won it, flat out.
Was driving a 55 stock Chevy cross-country
and I got a race with this GTO
for pink slips.
I beat the GTO by 3 hours.
Of course the guys in the GTO
couldn't drive worth a damn.
But I'll tell you one thing.
There's nothing like building up
an automobile from scratch
and wiping out
one of these Detroit machines.
That'll give you a set of emotions
that'll stay with you.
You know what I mean ?
All satisfactions are permanent.
