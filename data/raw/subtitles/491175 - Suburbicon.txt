Narrator:
Welcome to suburbicon,
 a town of great wonder and
excitement.
 Founded in 1947,
 suburbicon was built
 with the promise of
prosperity for all.
 And in only 12 short years,
 it has grown
from a few small homes
 to a living,
breathing community
 with all the conveniences of
the big city
 without all the noise
or the traffic.
 And now, with nearly 60,000
residents,
they enjoy their own schools,
 a fire department,
 and a police department.
 There's a shopping mall.
 A first-rate hospital.
 Why, we even have
our own choir.
(Choir singing)
 The people of suburbicon
 hail from all corners
of this great nation.
 A melting pot of diversity
from cities as far away as...
Children: New york!
Narrator: And...
All: Ohio!
Narrator: And even...
All: Mississippi!
Narrator: The only thing
suburbicon is missing is you.
 Isn't it time
for your new start?
 Come home to suburbicon.
(Bicycle bell ringing)
Henry: Hey there, tex!
Boy: I'm two-wheelin' it!
He got a license for that?
He ain't broke nothin' yet.
Well, give him an hour.
He'll break something.
Mrs. Pendelton.
Watch yourself, henry.
We just took his wheels off.
Say, have you met your neighbor
yet?
No, they just moved in last
night,
but i'm baking them a custard.
Mmm, boy!
Hey, fellows.
Sir.
Here we go.
Got all the utilities
and a new subscription
to good housekeeping.
Is mrs. Mayers about?
I'm mrs. Mayers.
Well, all right!
Uh, welcome to suburbicon.
Hope you enjoy your stay.
(Chuckles)
Is that our mail?
Oh...
Sorry.
(Knock on door)
Have you met your new neighbor?
You can put that in andy's room,
and that goes in the living
room. Thank you.
(Clamoring)
Calm down!
Hey, come on, I can't hear you!
I can't...
One at a time, one at a time!
Right?
Chuck! Chuck!
We don't want 'em here.
(Clamoring)
Can I ask who thought this'd be
all right?
Well, I think we thought
that the community
would tolerate them.
Not we. Him!
You?
(Clamoring)
Quiet down. We've spoken
with the city planners,
and the adjacent homes
will be supplied fencing
to block the view of the mayers.
And who's gonna pay for that?
We'll pay for it, jackson.
The housing committee.
'Cause we ain't gonna pay for
it.
You're not gonna pay for it,
god damn it!
But there's not much we can do
about these folks.
Oh, we can do something
about it.
James, read the petition.
(Crowd agreeing)
(Mumbling)
(Reading) "We defy
the supporters of mr. Mayers
"to say our fears are
groundless.
(Crowd agreeing)
"We favor racial integration,
"but only at such time
"the negro shows
he's ready for it.
"They don't seek to better
themselves.
(All agreeing)
"This community has come too far
to move backwards.
"We demand our civil rights
"to live where we want
and with whom we want,
"and, with god's help,
we will overcome!"
(Cheering and applauding)
Margaret: You remember
what happened in baltimore?
And trenton?
That's why people moved here.
The wolcotts said all our
property values will drop.
So even if we wanted to sell,
we can't.
Oh, for heaven sakes, rose.
If anybody, it's those wolcotts
that bring down property values.
(Vocalizing explosions)
Rose: This is a peaceful town.
People get crazy over things
like this.
Nicky, sweetheart, come here.
Honey, that mayers family's got
a little boy your age up there
on that porch.
Why don't you hop on over there
and take him for baseball?
Mom, do I have to?
Don't look at me.
Nicky! You take that little
colored boy
and play him some baseball.
Your mom and i
are gonna finish these beans,
and then we'll make you
some butter cookies for after.
Go on. Go on.
I don't want to play baseball.
Hey!
Hey.
You play baseball?
Yep.
They play out behind the
nazarene church.
We ain't nazarene.
We're episcopalian.
All right then.
You like baseball?
Yeah.
You like it?
(Crickets chirping)
Man: (On radio)
The crickets were listening.
The night was listening to her.
 Then there was a sound!
 Only a woodchuck, surely,
beating a hollow log.
 No. No, it was lavinia nebbs.
 It was most surely
the heart of lavinia nebbs.
 And she went down the steps,
faster, faster,
 running now down the steps,
(footsteps on radio)
 Plunging faster and faster,
(indistinct chatter)
 Down, down into the pit of
the ravine.
Woman: Only a little way.
 Across the bridge. Run.
 Run. Don't turn. Don't look.
 If you see him,
you'll not be able to move!
 You just run!
Man: Up the path,
between the hills,
 the top of the path,
the street.
 And even with the light,
 the fear swirled a...
(Turns radio off)
Nicky, you need to get up.
There are men in the house.
Come on. Come on.
They're gonna take
what they want and leave.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Get the hell out of that chair.
Shut up.
Get me a drink.
Maggie.
(Wheels squeaking)
(Pours water)
On a tray.
Give me a drink on a tray, too.
(Pours water)
Sloan: All right.
Look, can we just get this over
with?
What's the hurry?
Got an appointment?
Sloan: That's right.
(Grunts)
(Chuckles)
Let's quit fucking around
and go.
Sloan: Come on, lady.
Just put your arms around my
neck.
Here we go.
I'll do that.
She don't mind.
You don't mind, do you, ma'am?
No.
Sloan: That's right.
She don't mind.
Where's the toilet?
Um, it's... it's down the hall.
Up to your left.
You got polio?
What?
Polio.
Margaret:
She was in a car accident.
Shit.
Anybody die?
What is wrong with you?
Just getting the lay of
the land.
Want to know if i'm talking to
a killer.
She wasn't...
My husband was driving.
(Whistles)
But no one died.
Yeah. It all worked out
just fine.
(Whistles)
Hey! Hey!
Let's get moving.
Louis: Coming! Fuck!
Man: (On radio)
In just a moment,
 the names of the supporting
players,
 and a word about next week's
story of suspense.
Now, we had an agreement
that if we cooperate,
no harm will come to us.
Well,
harm is one of those things
you can't never tell about
in advance.
Least
that's been my experience,
far as it goes.
But
you probably know more about
that than me.
You must think
we're pretty sick, huh?
Couple animals.
Is that what you think?
Yeah. That's what you think.
You're pretty quiet over there.
What do you think
about all this?
I'm sure that you won't hurt us.
Sloan: Lady,
you ain't in a position
to be sure about anything.
Do you have to tie him up?
No! Ow. Ow.
Sloan: Jesus christ.
Think about it for a minute.
It's a question
that answers itself.
Louis: Let's just
get this over with.
What are you so fucking nervous
about?
He's just a little boy!
Sloan: We'll start with
the auntie over here.
Shut up her yappin'.
Please! Please...
(Muffled grunting)
Sloan:
"Auntie em! Auntie em..."
Just breathe normal.
Good.
I love that fucking movie.
Okay. Okay, nicky.
Nicky: No! No! Dad! Dad!
Dad.
Dad.
Louis: I'll do the kid.
No! No, no, no!
(Muffled screaming)
Settle down, kid.
It's gonna be a party.
(Muffled grunting)
(Shushes)
Doctor: Chloroform is
a progressive depressant.
It works on the motors.
Usually just has
a temporary narcotic effect,
but, obviously,
your wife respired a lot
more of the stuff,
and her organs are failing.
Nicky! Honey, we were
so worried about you.
Gardner: Son.
Can you hear me?
There's something
i have to tell you.
It's something very sad.
(Ventilator hissing)
Priest: Unto almighty god,
we commend the soul of rose,
our sister departed,
and we commit her body
to the ground.
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection
unto eternal life
through our lord jesus christ.
If there's anything you need,
don't hesitate to call me.
Rose was a very brave woman.
Yes.
Come on, nicky.
Let's you and me take a walk.
Yes, sir.
Man: She loved you both
very much.
Gardner: Thank you.
Episcopalians,
they're all full of shit.
Someday, you'll understand.
Meantime, you take my word
for it.
I will, uncle mitch.
Mitch: I know right now
your path,
it looks pretty bleak.
Your ma's dead, and that,
that's tough.
Tough for me, too.
My own sister.
But you can't just button up,
pull a long face,
like your ma did
after her accident.
Yes, uncle mitch.
Attaboy.
Now, who loves you like a son?
Daddy does.
Who else, you little shit?
You do, uncle mitch.
Who lets you keep all the coins
that'll stay in your pockets,
huh?
You do, uncle mitch.
Come on!
(Grunting)
Attaboy.
(Coins falling)
Damn, you weigh a fucking ton,
kid.
Gardner: (Sighs) Damn it.
Just once i'd like to see
your brother show some sense.
Margaret: Come on, mitch.
All right. Hold your horses,
maggie.
(Grunts)
Nicky, we've decided
it'd be best
if your auntie margaret came
and stayed with us for a while.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Mitch: Swear to god,
i didn't have a business to run,
i'd stay, too.
Would you like that, son?
Margaret: He's had a bad shock.
He doesn't want to talk
right now.
He just needs some time.
Mitch: I tell you something,
gardner.
I ever get my hands on
the cocksuckers
that did that to rosie,
i'm gonna peel 'em back
from their assholes,
turn 'em inside out,
so their guts are hanging out
and they're pissing blood...
Mitch!
All right.
What was with that service?
Your aunt will sleep upstairs.
And i'll stay down here.
We'll be fine, son.
We'll be strong.
Man: (On tv)
Coward, am I?
Woman: I fought for you
with john phillips all I can.
 You're not even man enough
to fight your own...
Man 2: Sugar-cured ham.
Pre-cooked. Ready to serve.
 And you can pick them up
at your favorite food store.
(Applause)
Nicky!
Hey.
Hey.
Your mama died?
Yeah.
She go to heaven?
I guess.
I got a ground snake.
You want to see?
Does it bite?
Nah. He ain't got no teeth.
You can have it.
What's it eat?
Grasshopper or cricket.
I got a mason jar full of 'em.
What's its name?
(Chuckles) He ain't got no name.
He's a snake.
You keep it.
I'll get them bugs.
Dad?
Nicky.
How long have you been there?
Maggie.
What's the matter, angel?
He had a nightmare.
Maggie will put you to bed.
It's all right, sweetheart.
 There's nothing to be afraid
of anymore, nicky.
I know.
Do you know who this is?
This is st. Patrick.
He's your patron saint.
Did you know that?
No.
He's the patron saint
of all the irish.
But i'm not irish.
Sure you are.
Your grandfather
was a shipbuilder from galway.
And every day
he'd pray to st. Patrick
for the bride of his dreams.
And then he came to america,
and he met your grandmother.
And together
they prayed for a family.
And st. Patrick blessed them
with your mother
and your uncle mitch and me.
And then your mom
prayed to st. Patrick for you.
She did?
Mmm-hmm.
Should we pray for your mom now?
Okay.
Margaret: May the light
of st. Patrick find
a place in your heart
 and remind us that loved ones
must someday depart.
 May their journey be gentle
through gold fields of rye.
 And our sorrow be silenced,
and our love never die.
 Amen.
Nicky: Amen.
(Indistinct chatter)
Margaret, it's awful.
It's such a loss.
(Brakes squeaking)
Rose was an inspiration.
She's with jesus now.
Thank you, ladies.
Pray for rose.
Woman: Nothing like this
ever happened here.
This is a safe place.
It was.
(Horn honking)
Well, she's very young.
And he has a kid with her?
(Indistinct mumbling)
Roger: Gardner.
Welcome back.
Sorry to hear about your loss.
Thanks, roger.
Gardner, this is bill thackery,
a new account executive.
Bill, this is gardner lodge,
financial vp.
(Elevator dings)
Glad to meet you.
Likewise. Sorry we couldn't have
met under more...
It's just a tragedy.
(Indistinct chatter)
I'm so sorry, mr. Lodge.
Gardner: Thanks, linda.
I'm so sorry.
What do we have today?
Nothing right away.
Mr. Pappas would like
to see you whenever...
Thanks.
(Intercom buzzes)
Yes.
Linda: John sears on six.
Hi, john.
John: Oh, god, gardner,
i'm so sorry.
 I'm awfully sorry
for your loss.
I... I don't know what to say.
It's all right, john.
 I'm so sorry.
 Really, she was great.
She was wonderful!
Thanks, john.
 Yeah, okay.
 But...
Linda, hold my calls.
Linda: Yes, sir.
(Elevator dings)
Ed: Gardner! Gardner.
I'm so sorry to hear
about your loss. Wow.
Wow. Come on back. Come on back.
Virginia, hold my calls.
Gardner.
(Sighing)
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm okay, ed.
I know it. I know it.
Gardner, look.
I just want you to know
we're in there with you.
You know? We're...
We're with you.
Thanks, ed.
Okay! (Chuckles)
I'm glad we had this talk.
(Whirring)
Margaret: Got any coupons?
Woman: This one's for the bread.
Margaret: Mmm-hmm.
Woman:
This one's for the ovaltine.
It says 20% off ovaltine.
How much is that?
Margaret:
Uh, 20% of 49 cents is...
Let's just call it half off.
What's your name?
Margaret: Oh, that's nicky,
and he's helping me out today.
Why aren't you in school?
'Cause he's playing hooky to
help me out.
Nicky, will you put these things
in her basket, please?
Hooky.
On a monday.
You're a lucky boy.
Margaret: That's 12, 13, 14, 15,
five is $20.
Don't forget your green stamps.
(Squeaking)
(Intercom buzzes)
Linda, I... no calls.
Linda: Sorry, mr. Lodge,
 but I thought
you might want this one.
 It's the police department.
I... i'll take it.
(Clears throat) Yes.
Man: (On phone) Mr. Lodge?
Yes.
This is captain gale hightower.
 Right off the bat,
 I ve got to tell you
i'm sorry about your wife.
Thank you.
The other thing is,
I got a couple of guys here
i'd like you to look at.
Stamford police picked 'em up
last night
and sent 'em down
because of your description.
They've been caught?
 Now don't get too anxious
there, mr. Lodge.
 Nobody's been caught
unless you say they have.
These are just two clowns picked
up trying to kill each other.
Well...
What do you want me to do?
 Take a look at 'em.
 You know, if you'd be so kind
and all.
 Hate to go over old ground,
 but you sure there wasn't
any cash in the house
the night of the break-in?
Hardly any. Why?
These two morons had
a lot of dough on them
when they were picked up.
Thank god it wasn't
the schvartzes
that just moved in.
Excuse me?
Isn't that what you jews
call 'em? Schvartzes?
I'm an episcopalian.
Really? I thought you were
jewish.
Why?
Because of your last name.
Lodge?
Sounded jewish.
I'm an episcopalian.
Is that right? Anyway,
I took the liberty of having
a squad car
pick up your sister-in-law.
He was afraid to stay home
alone.
Must he be subjected to this?
Beats me.
How you doing, junior?
I'm okay.
I think it's okay.
Well, I don't think it's okay.
I don't think it's okay
that he's been having
nightmares.
I don't think it's okay
that he be asked to see
these people again.
Are you sadists down here?
All right.
Better wait out here, kid.
We'll only be a minute.
(Door closes)
(Sighs)
Man: Step up.
Face forward.
Hightower: That's right. Line up
against the wall, gentlemen.
Turn to your right, please,
gentlemen.
Now face front again.
Keep it shut, please!
Well?
No.
Ma'am?
Come on, dear. You're not
picking out wallpaper.
No.
They're not there.
I just wanted to be sure.
Hightower:
Okay, then. That's it.
Turn that goddamn light off,
lou!
What are you thinking?
What are you doing in here?
Nicky!
What is he doing in here?
I'm sorry. Lou, take him out and
keep him out, will you, please?
Lou: Sorry about that.
Hightower: Let's go!
Nicky: Dad?
Dad.
Hightower: You folks sure?
I'm sure.
Margaret: Yes.
All right, then.
Man: Let's go.
Hightower: No winners tonight.
Sorry, boys.
Margaret: Mrs. Najarian
sent some flowers.
Garner: She's a fine woman.
We owe the najarians a dinner.
Margaret: And the stouts also.
Gardner:
Well, not on the same night.
Uh, herb and thayer
don't get along.
Margaret: Oh. Well, just let me
know when you think it's proper
to start entertaining.
I was just rereading
some of that book you gave me?
Life races?
Yeah, doctor...
Evan maslansky.
Right.
You know how he says
that life is a series of races,
and you have to triumph over
each one
before you proceed to the next?
Hmm.
Evan says that when you find
a hurdle in one
of your liferaces,
you can either remove it
or choose another life race.
Well, I just think
we're being tested, gardner.
Maybe, margaret.
Rose's accident,
that was a hurdle.
Gardner: It was.
And we chose another race.
Margaret: And when you lost
your life savings,
that was another hurdle.
Gardner: Hmm.
And we'll triumph over this one
as well.
Margaret:
Because you're strong, gardner.
And so is nicky.
And we're gonna
get through this together,
aren't we, nicky?
How you feeling, son?
(Sighs)
Fine.
Fine.
(Sighs)
It's been a rough day.
Dad?
How come you said
it wasn't them?
Wasn't who?
The robbers
who killed mom.
Nicky, did you see the line-up?
I saw...
Because that certainly was not
the robbers.
It certainly was not.
But I thought...
Young man,
I want you to understand
something.
People walk into my office
every day,
say they've met me,
i don't remember them at all.
Or sometimes I see people that
i think I know, and then,
later, they tell me that
we've never met.
Maybe they look like someone
else.
Maybe they talk
like someone else.
Maybe they're even related.
But, dad, I saw.
No, no, my point... my point
is that it's a very tricky
business
this who you know
and who you don't know.
And i'm telling you
that I got a good look
at those clowns,
and i've never seen them before.
Uncle mitch promised that...
Uncle mitch doesn't matter.
Uncle mitch is a buffoon.
(Sighs)
Now, this is a family matter,
and I don't want you talking
to uncle mitch about it.
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.
It's a terrible,
terrible tragedy.
(Door bell jingles)
(Indistinct chatter)
(Music playing)
Mitch:
It's a torment to me, father.
I feel like it's not a good
environment for the child,
my episcopalian brother-in-law.
Father: Your sister's there.
Margaret's a good woman,
but she's very scattered.
It's eating at me.
It ain't right.
 Who is gonna replace rose?
Father: I don't know.
 I mean, listening to you,
I... I just don't know.
And your brother-in-law,
it doesn't matter who he is.
He is the father of the boy.
Let me ask you,
(indistinct chatter
in distance)
 Has the child complained?
Mitch: It's a damn travesty.
 Rose was the heart
of that family.
(Applauding)
 And now,
 there's no heart there
for the child.
Father: The mother's gone,
 god bless her.
You're not gonna be the mother.
You're a good man,
but you're a bachelor.
 Has the child complained?
No.
Go home, mitch.
And god bless you.
God bless you.
(Dog barking)
Margaret: No!
(Panting)
(Margaret gasping)
Margaret: No.
(Margaret gasps)
Please. (Gasps)
(Clattering)
(Panting)
(Yells)
(Panting)
Angel?
(Hammering)
(Door opens)
Andy, honey,
you come inside.
I'm just catching bugs.
You come in
and do your homework.
Mom!
Andy!
Yes, ma'am.
(Hammering continues)
(Hammering continues)
You and I are eating alone
tonight.
Your father has another...
I'm not eating anymore.
You're not, huh?
I want to move.
Hmm, is that right?
I don't want to be here anymore.
Is that right?
Well,
let me tell you something,
mister.
You are a little boy.
And right now, you're
a very silly little boy.
And the day that what you want
starts counting around here
is the day that you go
to work and earn money
for dinners that
i can say no to.
Do you want to go to work
tomorrow?
Because I can arrange that.
You just say the word,
and i'll pick up the telephone
and tell mr. Karger
to expect nicholas tomorrow.
Oh, shall I do that?
No, ma'am.
Hmm.
Well,
I guess I won't hear
another word out of you.
(Typing)
(Phone ringing)
Mr. Egan's office.
Can you hold, please?
 Mr. Egan's office.
Uncle mitch?
I beg your pardon?
 Is uncle mitch there?
Mr. Egan's in a meeting
right now.
Can I take a message?
 Huh?
He's in a meeting, ma'am.
Can I take a message?
Can I wait till
he's done meeting?
 Well, I don't think you want
to hold. It may be a while.
 Who am I speaking to?
Can he call me?
 If you give me your number,
i'll be happy to
leave him a message.
What's your last name?
(Indistinct chatter)
Linda: May I help you?
Sloan: Just sit down, lady.
Gentlemen, he is in a meeting!
Same meeting he's been in
for the past three days?
Hi, pal.
(Stuttering)
I'm so sorry, mr. Lodge.
It's fine, linda.
Uh, bill, maybe we could pick
this up some other time.
I guess, gardner. You bet.
These men are doing some work
on my house.
Well, that's nice.
Good meeting you.
Gardner:
What, are you crazy?
You barge in here
in the middle of a...
Shut up!
Oh. Oh.
You think you can fuck us?
Is that what you think?
You think you can fuck us,
and that's the end of it?
We made a deal.
You have to live with it.
Live with this,
you fucking hard-on.
Big shot. Bring your fucking kid
to the police station?
Mental case!
(Panting)
Take care of that kid.
I don't care what you do
or how you do it.
Either you do it,
or we do it.
And that money?
Fucking due and payable.
Big man.
Mental case.

(Drumming)
Andy: You've got to eat a lot
to get that fat.
(Men continue clamoring)
A lot!
Soon as he quits,
somebody else picks it up
and starts beating on it.
All night, all day.
My dad says
we don't show 'em nothin'.
And you don't show 'em
you're scared.
Don't show 'em nothin'.
(Clamoring continues)
(Intercom buzzes)
Linda: Your brother-in-law
on seven.
Mitch.
Mitch: Gardner, you call me?
 No.
I got the weirdest message.
My heart skipped a beat.
Says, "mrs. Lodge called."
Has your home number on it.
I thought it might've been you.
 Are you there?
Yeah.
 My god, I could've
dropped dead right there!
"Mrs. Lodge called."
Swear to god!
That's very strange.
 Strange? Yeah, strange.
I should come visit.
Come see nicky.
Mitch...
Give us a while.
Huh?
 It's been hard for us.
 And I know it's been hard
for you, too. I'm sorry.
 But no visitors,
 just for a while.
Nicky needs time.
Time?
For what, time?
Bye, mitch.
(Typing)
Man: (On tv) Just snap 'em
together and build a castle!
(Whistling)
 Or a chair.
Margaret: Nicky?
Your father would like
to have a word with you.
Man: Monkey sticks are fun!
 Even on rainy days,
when you have to stay in.
(Knock on door)
Gardner: Yes?
Shut the door, nicholas.
Have a seat.
Nick, i've tried to instill in
you a certain discipline.
Your mother indulged you,
i think.
And that's fine,
up to a certain point.
The cocoon and so forth.
That's fine.
But now we...
We draw the ledger,
and we... we see where we are.
You understand?
Yes, sir.
I see a little boy
who is sullen.
I see a little boy
who is frequently withdrawn,
in his own little world.
Little boy with no friends.
Doesn't fit in.
These things are important,
nicholas. We don't laugh off
these things.
So we've been looking
into sleepaway school.
A place where young men learn
about discipline
and fitting in and...
The fledgling always
wants the nest, nicholas,
but is it good for him?
Is it good for him?
Well, we've consulted
the experts.
I think not.
I think not.
So your aunt maggie
and I have decided
that battle creek, the academy,
is the best solution.
And starting next semester,
they've made room
for a new plebe.
I had to pull a few strings
to get you in, but...
Congratulations.
(Grunting)
(Cash register dings)
Karger: That's $20.
Well, sir, that wasn't
the price on the display.
The price went up.
To $20?
(Sighs)
I believe that's $20 also,
isn't it, margaret?
Mmm-hmm.
It's $20.
May I ask you a question?
I think you'll find the prices
much better elsewhere.
I imagine that's true.
Don't worry.
We'll put these back!
Have jimmy restock.

Woman: ...And we understood
that it was
going to be all white.
 We were very happy to buy a
home here.
Man: Do you think
a negro family moving here
 will affect the community as
a whole?
(Cheering and applauding)
Woman: Definitely.
Man: In what way?
Woman: We used to live in
washington, dc,
and we saw a very good example
of that there.
 The whole trouble with
this integration business is
 that, in the end,
it probably will end up
 with mixing socially.
 And you will have...
 Well, I think their aim is
mixed marriages
 and becoming equal
with the whites.
 But the only way
they're gonna do that
 is by education
and by bettering themselves,
 not by pushing in the way
they have here.
Soon as we get
the insurance money,
everything will be fine.
Margaret: Mmm-hmm.
We could go to aruba.
Aruba? Where's that?
Oh, it's in the caribbean.
It's a dutch protectorate.
There's no reciprocal
extradition.
I've never been to
a protectorate before.
We could take a boat
from another island.
Leave no ticket trail.
Well, isn't it spicy mango food?
Oh, you can get
any sort of food.
Food of any description.
And there's golfing.
Couples golfing.
I went with rose many times.
Oh, that's good.
Darling, you could relax
and paint.
Express yourself.
Hmm.
You never really
express yourself.
I loved rose, but you need
someone to help you do that.
And do you know
who that someone is?
Well, let me think about that.
You do that.
Well, martha stout is awfully
friendly.
Oh, well, let me try
to jog your memory.
We should have done this
a long time ago, gardner.
You were trapped.
(Squeaking)
Linda: (On intercom) Mr. Lodge,
i have a lieutenant hightower.
Tell him i'm not in.
 You're on speaker, sir.
Sorry, lieutenant.
You've come at
a very busy time.
Well, i'm sorry to drop in
on you like this.
I wanted to clear something up
that's just come to light.
What happened to you?
Oh, uh...
Horsing around with my kid.
He's got a mean right.
He does.
So any new progress on
the investigation?
Well, actually, I was hoping
you might be able to help me
with another case.
You know a character
named rizzoli?
No. Rizzoli? No.
He got killed in a vehicular
on the turnpike
a couple days ago.
Rizzoli. Frank rizzoli?
Never heard of him.
I'm sorry for his loss.
Of life?
Yeah, I guess he probably is,
too.
He was a loan shark for the mob,
so I wouldn't feel too bad.
Then how can I help?
Well, we've been going through
his books.
He has all these books.
Notes.
All in code.
Like,
"suburbicon shave and a haircut,
8,500 long."
Seems like a lot of cash
for a shave and a haircut.
Even for suburbicon.
But if you keep reading down,
it has this one very odd...
It says, "pick up package of
7,000 apples
"at gardner lodge."
And that's your name.
But we started
looking through phone books,
and lo and behold,
we found a hotel up near trenton
called garden lodge.
So either he was expecting
7,000 apples
from someone at garden lodge,
or he expected them from you.
Now, i'm not asking you,
mr. Lodge,
if you were into the mob
for money.
But if you were, and if you
didn't pay or couldn't pay,
well,
that might explain
what happened to your wife.
But you say you don't know him.
I don't know him.
Well,
we'll keep looking.
Thank you, lieutenant.
I'll be in touch.
(Door opens)
(Door closes)
Some of the people are
definitely against integration.
And they have told my children
(Knock on door)
That they have
to marry niggers.
And my child doesn't even know
what a nigger is.
Yes?
Miss o'rory,
i'm bud cooper
with canyon prop and life.
Oh, well, thank you very much,
mr. Cooper,
but i'm quite sure we have all
the insurance that we need.
(Laughing) I'm sure you do,
but fact is, i'm not a salesman.
I'm here to discuss your
sister's policy.
Oh, you'd have to talk to
the man of the house about that.
He has all the information.
He'll be back this evening.
Could...
Can I just come in for a second?
Well, I don't have any of
the information.
Oh, no, it doesn't matter,
miss o'rory.
I'd just like to chat with you
for a minute.
Oh, I haven't the faintest idea
how I can help you...
Oh.
Since I don't have any of
the information.
What did you say you do
for the insurance people?
Oh, uh...
I guess my official title
is claims investigator.
What you might call
a professional skeptic.
Okay. Is there something wrong
with the policy?
No, no, no! Policy seems to be
all shipshape.
Yes, mr. Lodge has been very
steady with the payments.
Your agent...
Mr. Elkins?
Right. Stan elkins.
(Chuckles)
Yes, he says everything's in
order. Have you met him?
Oh, no. I don't know anything
about gardner's
business affairs.
That's why i'm afraid
i can't help you.
Well, I wouldn't worry overmuch
about information, miss o'rory,
because, you know, people always
put "information" in quotes,
but it isn't always like that.
I mean, people just don't
realize how much they know.
For instance, you happen to know
your agent's name.
Mmm-hmm.
I have all that information
right here.
I'm more interested in
the other kind,
which all really boils down
to one word.
Do you live here now,
miss o'rory?
Oh, well,
i'm here now, of course.
Is that a temporary
or a permanent arrangement?
I think nicky needs a mother.
Of course.
Um, what was that word?
Excuse me?
Well, you said it all boiled
down to one word?
Did I?
Oh! Yes!
Yes, it all boils down
to one word, coincidence.
That happens in the opera a lot.
Coincidence.
(Laughs) Yeah, sure. Aida.
Uh, barber of seville.
It's just... (Chuckles)
It gets ridiculous.
But in real life
doesn't happen that much.
No. I guess if it did, it would
stop being a coincidence.
(Laughing)
Yeah, see, it's not the policy,
miss o'rory. It's the claim.
See, a coincidence on a claim,
that's like a...
That's like a little red flag
that makes us sit up
and take notice.
And this claim has a bunch
of little red flags on it.
What kind of red flag?
Nothing to worry about. (Laughs)
Believe me,
i'm just here to chase down
all those little red flags.
It's very routine.
We just need to have them
explained to us before we can
send out a check.
The claim will be honored,
of course.
Hmm, that's good.
Oh, sure.
Let's just take a look here.
So the first little red flag
that I noticed
was that march 3rd,
about three months before
the incident,
the amount of the whole part of
the policy was substantially
increased.
It's kind of unusual.
I don't suppose
you know anything about that?
Mmm-hmm. I do.
That was gardner's idea.
It was, huh?
Okay.
What else have we got?
We've got...
Oh. More than one claim
on the policy.
That's always a red flag.
The claim from rose's car
accident?
Bud: Yeah, he stung us good
on that one.
Well, that's okay.
That's what we're here for.
The bank says he hasn't made his
payments for his home loan in
three months.
Oh. Well, times have been
a little tight around here.
Gardner lost our savings when
he started his own business.
Is that right?
What else have we got?
Oh!
Here's another little red flag.
I didn't even notice this one
before.
Uh, about five months ago,
mr. Lodge redeemed $5,000 worth
of his whole life policy
with us.
We always like to notice things
like that.
Nicky!
Nicky, get back in your room.
(Clanging)
Man: Go back
to where you came from!
(Clanging continues)
(Men shouting)
Man 2: Get the hell out of here!
I'm sorry. That money's
for nicky's college education.
I guess you put it
in a trust fund or something?
Would you like a cup of coffee?
That would be absolutely
terrific.
Thank you.
Yeah. (Chuckles)
I'm sorry to be such a pest.
I mean, this stuff isn't very
important,
but I tell you,
i could put you on the floor
with some of the scams
i've seen.
I've got to smile just thinking
about them. (Chuckles)
I mean, I had this one guy
couple of years ago,
he put in a claim for
his clothing store burned down.
You're not gonna believe this.
We find a couple of gas cans
in there
with eulah may printed on them.
It's his wife's name.
It's the name of his pleasure
boat where he got the cans from.
(Both laughing)
I guess he thought those
aluminum cans
were gonna burn up or something.
I don't know what he thought!
And cars. Thank you.
You wouldn't believe
what people do to their cars
just because something's
a little wrong
with the transmission.
They figure they can
fleece us for the whole thing.
Sell 'em for scrap,
report 'em stolen.
See, but the body shop guy knows
we pay a bounty for those
things.
Mmm.
Yeah, I mean, just this week,
half your block tried to tap us
for homeowner's
because of your new neighbors.
(Chuckles) Can you believe it?
How about them neighbors!
(Both chuckling)
Oh, excuse me.
(Chuckles)
Yeah.
You've been in this business
long as I have,
you develop a nose
for hanky-panky.
'Cause it smells, you know?
It's got this faint aroma.
This smells bad.
That smells good.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
But this one?
This particular case here?
Does not have that faint aroma.
Thank goodness for that.
Nah, this one stinks.
This one... i've been smelling
this one since I got off
the turnpike.
Jesus, does it stink!
You sleep with gardner,
do you?
I beg your pardon!
Well, you know,
that's none of my business,
but i've got to tell you,
that kind of nonsense,
it can come back
and haunt you down the road.
If you killed her, I mean.
How dare you come into this home
when my sister is dead
and make jokes about flags
and the barber of seville!
Oh, I assure you, miss o'rory,
i am anything but joking.
You see, in my experience,
nobody's stupid enough
to increase their insurance
policy just before they kill
their wife.
If there's one thing you can be
sure of, it's that gardner lodge
isn't stupid.
Oh, I agree.
So you've just proved
yourself wrong, mr. Cooper.
I made it up.
You made it up?
I made it up.
He didn't take out more
insurance on rose.
I was just fishing.
I do it on every claim.
I go fishing.
And you know what?
This time I caught a whopper.
What?
You said "we."
What?
"We lost our savings
"when gardner tried
to start his own business."
"We lost our,"
not "they lost their."
I think you should leave
before I call the police.
Call them.
Hell, you know what?
Let's just walk down the street.
There's a dozen of them
standing a block away.
You get out of my house.
Your house?
Oh! Get out!
Get out. Get out, you!
I loved my sister,
and I love her son!
You love her husband, too?
Oh!
You tell mr. Lodge
i'll be back this evening.
We can have a chat about it
then.
(Brake hisses)
You're taking the night off.
What?
You're taking the night off.
I've got more important things
for you to do.
You're crazy, man.
I got stanhope to come in
and cover for you.
We've got business.
All right. What is it?
And don't talk so loud.
This guy's a fucking hard-on,
is what it is.
He hung up on me last night.
He doesn't care.
I think he's getting ready
to fuck us.
He can't fuck us.
That's right!
(Indistinct chatter)
I'm telling you, this is
the last time
that clown's gonna ignore us.
That's why you're taking
the night off.
Take care of the kid
and the lady.
Give him something to think
about when he gets home.
Two more fucking people?
I don't know
if I can get into that.
I'm telling you,
you ain't got any choice.
It's either that,
or he fucks us!
The guy don't respond,
he don't respond.
Two people, man!
Look, if you can't take care
of a kid and a lady,
you know what that means?
It means
you're a fucking liability.
(People clamoring)
(All shouting)
(Horn blaring)
(Panting)
Gardner, i'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.
I love you so much.
Please don't be angry with me.
What happened?
(All clamoring)
(Knock on door)
(Gasps)
Mr. Lodge?
Yes.
I believe your sister-in-law
might have mentioned me to you?
Yes.
Thank you.
Hello, ma'am.
Hello.
Right this way.
It's quite a commotion
out there.
Yes, I know. Have a seat.
Whole town's out there,
throwing rocks and garbage.
Did you see that?
I saw.
All those people, you'd think
we're in mississippi.
Please, just keep
the curtains closed.
Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.
(Exhales)
Now, what are these
accusations...
Miss o'rory, I tell you,
a cup of coffee
would be really terrific,
if it isn't too much trouble.
No trouble.
Bud: Thank you.
Look, i've had a long day.
So let's just get right to
the point.
You killed your wife.
You want to collect.
I want a piece of the action.
I don't want to talk
about this for a long time.
I'm not gonna negotiate.
I've had a long day.
I'm not gonna hear any denials.
Just tell me, yes or no.
What do you want?
You want some of the money?
I want all of it.
(Chuckles)
All of it.
Or you go straight to jail, pal.
I could walk outside
and have six police officers
here in no time.
Margaret: Here you go.
Thank you.
(Sniffles)
You don't have any choice.
I'm just gonna sit here
and wait for you to
figure that out for yourself.
All right?
If we did
kill my wife,
what makes you think
I wouldn't kill you, too?
Mr. Lodge.
(Laughs)
Are you crazy?
Do you think
that i'm the only investigator
that knows how to read
a claim for fraud?
Do you have any idea
what happens
when an investigator that's
working on a claim like this
dies?
Haven't you fucked with
the insurance company enough?
Believe me,
if anything happens to me...
(Chuckles)
(Slurps)
You're in deep, deep, deep...
(Choking)
(Screaming)
(Continues screaming)
(All shouting)
Get away from that car!
Get out of there!
Woman: Help! Help!
Officer:
Get back away from there!
Man: Under the bed!
(Grunting)
What did you put in the coffee?
Just lye!
(Screaming)
Just a little bit of lye.
(Gasping)
Don't move until I get back.
(People clamoring)
(Grunting and gasping)
Help, help, help...
Help...
(Grunting)
(Panting)
(Shatters)
(All shouting)
(Panting)
(Grunts)
(Grunting)
Nicky: Uncle mitch,
you've got to help!
 They're gonna kill me!
Nicky! What are you talking
about?
They're gonna kill me!
 You stay right there. I'll...
Uncle mitch? Uncle mitch!
Oh, nicky.
(Panting)
I put him in his car.
It's falling apart, maggie.
It's over.
We're gonna have to leave.
Where's nicky?
He talked to mitch.
(Sighs)
(Car engine starts)
(Car engine starts)
(Sobbing)
(Panting)
Margaret: Nicky?
Honey?
You have to have something
to eat.
Can't go to bed
on an empty stomach.
Nicky?
Well, all right.
Suit yourself.
I'll eat it.
Angel!
At least have some milk.
It's not my fault.
Why would anybody say
it was your fault?
You're not to blame.
We're gonna go away,
gardner and me.
Have you ever been to aruba?
It's a protectorate.
That's dutch.
There's all kinds
of exotic foods.
And couples golf.
(Grunts)
(Louis grunting)
(Margaret choking)

(Crowd clamoring outside)
(Panting)
(People clamoring outside)

(Thud)
Louis: Kid?
(Screaming)
Hi.
Come on, kid.
(Nicky screaming)
Louis: Get the fuck...
(Louis grunting)
(Screaming)
Louis: Who the fuck are you?
(Screaming)
Louis: Motherfucker!
Die!
(Gunshots)
(Screaming and panting)
Mitch: Come on, nicky.
Come on, son. Come out of there.
Attaboy. Attaboy.
Come on. Come on.
It's all over.
Go on. Go inside.
That's it.
Now, you don't make a noise,
you understand?
Huh?
Uh-huh.
You're a good boy, nicky.
You're gonna be fine.
Hey.
Who loves you like a son?
You do.
(Chuckles) Attaboy, nicky.
Okay, now you...
You take this.
Huh?
Okay.
You're a good boy.
Hello?
(Car engine humming)
You're becoming a liability.
Where you going?
Oh, you know,
just out for a ride.
Surprise for you
when you get home.
What did you do?
You're gonna pay us
that money.
What did you do?
You're gonna pay us
that money.
What did you do?
You're gonna pay us
that money!
(Fire engine horn blares)
(Crashing)
(Metal creaking)
(Firemen groaning)
Fireman: Help.
Help!
(Firemen cough and groan)
No!
(Screaming)
(Panting)
(Explosions continue)
Maggie?
Maggie!
Maggie?
Nicky?
Nicky?
(Gasps)
(Breathing shakily)
Give me that.
(Indistinct chattering)
Gardner:
These people are animals.
They took everything from us.
They took your aunt maggie,
mitch,
your mom.
I want you to stay away
from that colored boy.
You hear me?
Are you gonna
call the police?
I'll call the police
when we finish our talk.
Now,
these animals
took everything from us.
And we need
to make sense...
(Sighs) It was you.
You did all of this.
(Sighs)
What do you think you know,
big man?
Hmm?
Because I know
a lot of things.
That's the case
with being a grownup.
You have to make decisions.
Decisions like
what's best for the family.
Who's being helpful.
Who's a liability.
You know
what that word means, nicky?
You see, these men
killed your mom.
And then they came back.
Tie up loose ends,
so to speak.
He killed your aunt maggie.
Stabbed your uncle mitch.
As if that weren't bad enough,
then he killed you.
Right here in the kitchen.
Then I shot him.
Oh, he cut me a few times.
Maybe here.
Here.
Nothing too life-threatening.
"Officer, I did everything
i could to save my boy.
"His injuries were
just too great.
"Well,
"he's with his mama now.
"He's the littlest angel
in heaven."
That's you.
Little angel.
Or...
(Sighs)
...we call the police together.
We tell them
how these men
killed our family.
How we feel lucky
to be alive.
You ever heard of aruba, nicky?
We'll tell the papers we don't
want that insurance money,
but we're gonna use it
to rebuild our lives.
Our lives
far away
from the memory of this place.
And then we get on a plane
and go to aruba.
And we buy a big house
on the beach.
And we start over.
So, big man,
my big grown man,
you've got
a big decision to make.
Take your time.
It's sunday.
Sunday in suburbicon.
We've got all the time
in the world.
(Indistinct chattering)
Thank you.
Of course, ma'am.
Betty: One policeman
got his head busted open.
And a fire truck
hit and killed a man
down on lafayette street.
And three or four others
ended up in the hospital.
And rose lodge!
This...
None of this ever happened
before the mayers moved here.
This is a peaceful town.
Reporter: Have you heard
any rumors about the mayers?
Man: Oh, dozens and dozens
of rumors.
Oh, that he was being paid
by the naacp.
 That the reds were behind it,
 that the jews were behind it,
that this group and that group
were behind it.
 There were
all kinds of rumors.
 I guess some of them were
being spread deliberately.
 Some were just the result
of hysteria.
Woman: I don't feel that
they should be oppressed.
 But I moved here.
 One of the main reasons
 was because
it was a white community.
 And that...
Narrator: (On tv)
...The story of gerald mccloy
 and the strange thing that
happened to that little boy.
(Ball bouncing
against wall in distance)
 They say it all started
when gerald was two.
 That's the age
kids start talking.
 Least most of them do.
 Well, when he started talking,
you know what he said?
 He didn't talk words.
He went, "boing, boing,"
 instead.
(Ball continues bouncing)
(Tv continues indistinctly)
(Ball continues bouncing)
