What are you? A dog or a cow?
I'm a dog, but not just a dog.
I'm a dog with a
boner. Check it out!
Well, there it is.
Is the poop ready?
That's a roger on the poop.
Oh, holy crap, how
big was that dog?
Small, but there
was seven of them.
I'll give you three reasons
why this is a bad idea.
One, cops. Two, dogs.
Three, NRA front door.
Quit worrying, Dean.
These people deserve it.
They never give out candy.
Yeah, but remember last time
we pulled something like this?
Dean got his arm broke.
That's because he ran off
alone and fell in a ditch.
If he just sticks with
us, he'll be fine.
Come on! Let's do this.
Okay...
Go!
Ahh, uh-oh...
It's getting kinda big-ish.
- Come on!
- Quick!
No!
Doo-doo in mouth!
Doo-doo in mouth!
Let's get out of here!
We can't - there's
people in there!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
The scarecrow set
your house on fire.
No one's home. We
gotta call 911!
Dude! You're seriously
overreacting.
Call 911!
Hey, look! They
do give out candy.
We're so dead!
Oh, my God! My father's
going to kill me.
Come on, let's go.
Let's get out of here.
Wait! Wait a second,
I got an idea.
- Who's got a pen?
- Use Wes's dick!
Quick! Give me a first name.
Zeus!
A kid's name!
- Ricky!
- Okay.
Now a last name.
I got it! Stanton.
Wait, no! What?
That's my last name.
So? Your first name's not Ricky.
- Come on.
- Come on.
Go!
Check this out.
Numb-nuts kid caught his jacket
on fire during his prank.
Here's the best part.
His mommy wrote his
name on the collar.
'Ricky Stanicky'?
Dumb shit.
Bad news, Chief.
Just heard back.
No Stanickys in the
school district.
Kid must be from out of town.
Shit.
I can't believe that
actually worked.

Want to grab a quick drink?
Why would you have a quick drink
when you can have
the long drink?
In Finland, the happiest
country on Earth,
we invented the long drink...
That's it for the
beer in the garage.
Do we need to run
out and get more?
No. That's perfect.
You sure?
- Yeah. The place looks amazing.
- Yeah?
Maybe this would be a
good side hustle for us.
Erin and Dean's baby showers.
- I like it.
- Yeah.
And that's when
Gilbert Gines realized
that the answer to gang violence
may be found in the spit-valve
of a well-worn trumpet.
What is this?
Uh, it's a show called
'Hero of the Week'.
It's about everyday people who
do these incredible things.
My producer at Channel 6
wants me to submit for it.
He says he has a
good contact there.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Well, if I want
MFMBC to notice me,
what I need are
better assignments,
but all I get are these
babies-who-Tweet stories.
Mm!
Speaking of babies,
can you please hang these
pictures up for me, over there.
It's JT and Susan's
baby pictures.
Jesus, God! Was JT
born with adult teeth?
Oh, come on, his teeth
are cute. Look at that.
Cute? He looks like
hillbilly Hitler.
- You think all babies are cute.
- All babies are cute.
Yeah, sure.
And the remotes are
sticky for like 20 years.
Well, there are good things
about having kids too, you know.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I don't remember my
parents feeling that way.
You don't think your
parents enjoyed having kids?
It doesn't matter. What
we have is way better.
It's what we always
talked about.
Hmm.
I love you.
You love me.
- We love Paul.
- Hmm.
And we don't need anyone else.
Oh, my God! JT, leave me alone!
It is my baby shower, I'm
going to have one drink. One!
Dr. Kurihara said it is
perfectly fine. Hello.
Dr. Kurihara is part of the
medical industrial complex,
and Midwife Maggie said
you're on a strict vegan diet
and absolutely no alcohol.
Okay, well you are not Midwife
Maggie, you are my husband.
Yeah, I know, but
I'm also Daddy Doula.
- That's my job.
- You gotta stop saying that.
You're going to make
the baby throw up.
They can't... Can they
throw up inside of there?
Wait, JT's your doula?
Yeah, he also wants to be
naked when the baby is born.
- Don't you?
- I don't want to be naked.
I just want my shirt off, okay,
for the first
embrace, skin to skin.
It's a bonding thing.
- Good.
- Hey, you better get that.
That's the fourth time Ricky
called in, like, 20 minutes.
Yeah, see what he wants, man.
He's been blowing me up all day.
- Really?
- Yeah.
All right.
Stanicky! What up,
man? How's it going?
I'm going to get you a
tea, not wine, don't drink.
Yeah, hey I'm in the middle of
something right now. I just...
Are you serious?
Uh-huh. Okay.
Well, just do me a favor
and have someone call me
when you get out of
surgery, all right?
So you're all alone?
Shit, man, that sucks.
All right, hang in there.
We'll all be sending
you positive vibes
from over here, buddy.
Love you too, man.
What's going on?
What did he say?
It's back.
What's back?
- The cancer.
- Oh, God.
I thought he was
out of the woods.
Poor guy.
Are they going to
have to remove the
other testicle?
And can they even do that?
I thought you needed
at least one to live.
What? No! That's kidneys, dumbo.
Where is he?
He's in a hospital in Albany.
Albany? Why is he in Albany?
He flew in from Nairobi to
meet with some non-profits
and he had an attack.
They're gonna open
him up tonight.
Dean, you should
drive out there.
The poor guy's all alone.
I can't go tonight. What
about the baby shower?
And Summerhayes is
going to be here.
What? You're worried
about your boss?
Come on, he's just business.
Ricky's been there for
you guys your whole lives.
Dude, just go. I've got
Summerhayes covered.
What? No, no, no, no.
You should call him
and tell him you have
a family emergency.
You should go with Dean.
Are you serious? Babe, we
can't both bail on the boss.
Yes! Yes, you can.
I mean, he'll
probably be relieved
that he doesn't have
to go to a baby shower.
Well, looks like
we're going to Albany.
You were right, man
the Summerhayes thing
totally put it over the top.
The Devil's in the
details, my friend.
What the hell took
y'all so long?
- The flight leaves in an hour.
- Oh, sorry.
We were doing all the work
executing our brilliant
last-minute plan.
Who made the Stanicky calls?
Who cares who did what,
Wes? The point is it worked.
We got out of a baby shower,
and we got tickets to
Marc-fucking-Rebillet!
Whoo!
- How'd you score those babies?
- Yeah, this guy we work with
broke one of his
ankles last night.
He fell out of a tree trying
to get his kid's balloon.
- Poor guy.
- So we got his tickets.
Goddamn, y'all so lucky, man!
This kind of shit happens
to you all the time.
Hey! Good things
happen to good people.
That's right. Atlantic
City, here we come.
Let's tear New
Jersey a new armpit!
Whoa!
It's not the same but
it feels just as good.
I mean, you just have to have
sex on the side like a walrus.
Won't that dent the baby's head?
I had a friend named Liam, and
his head got all dick-dented.
I think maybe his mother
had a short vagina.
Just looking out
for baby Whitaker.
So you still going
with Whitaker, huh?
We are! It's a family
name. All right?
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah, thank you.
You guys know the rules.
Phones off, so we
don't get tracked.
- Mm-hm.
- Yep.
- All right. Wes.
- I'm Wes.
- Bible!
- Ooh.
All right...
What we got?
- Ricky's cancer's back.
- Oh, no.
Emergency surgery in Albany.
Oh, that's terrible.
Emergency surgery...
Hey, why does it
have to be cancer?
Like, won't everybody
get worried?
That mean I gotta
do chemo again?
Yeah, and that's going to take
us right into the World Series.
- Ahh.
- Boom!
All right, one final bit
of business before we land.
Stanicky phone. Let's get
this Instagram out of the way.
There we go.
- "Life is precious."
- It is.
- "And so is friendship."
- Hmm.
"Thanks to my boys for
being here for me."
Good.
All right, are we done?
Is it get drunk time?
- Yeah.
- A toast!
To Ricky Stanicky.
To Ricky Stanicky.
The best friend we never had.
Yoo!
♪ Get the fuck out
of bed Bitch, go! ♪
♪ Get up, get up!
You gotta go, gah! ♪
♪ Wake up, time to wake
up Bitch, get up! ♪
Woo-hoo-hoo!
God, that was good!
That was amazing!
- Thank you, Ricky Stanicky.
- The fucking Loop Daddy!
Unbelievable, dude.
It makes all that guilt I'm
feeling totally worthwhile.
Why do we even
have to feel guilt?
We could have just told them.
You know, and cut out
that whole angst part.
No, because the Rebillet tickets
fell into our lap this morning,
and the girls have had the
baby shower planned for weeks.
Yeah. Yeah, but
they're strong women.
I'm sure they
would've gotten over
us skipping one little party.
It's not one little party.
It's my baby shower.
Oh, a Jack and Coke.
I'll have a Dos
Equis, please. Hoo!
Do you have, uh... do
you have organic vodka?
Just any vodka, it's all...
- Anything.
- Thank you.
Speaking of vodka, I'll
take a Belvedere, neat,
and a plate of your
crispiest calamari.
No, no, Rod. No! Bad!
You keep freeloading
off the customers
and you're out of here.
He loves giving me the business.
Just to be clear, I'm
anything but a freeloader.
Just going to give you guys
a little 'squid pro quo'
for the calamari.
Really? Meaning?
Oh, I do a midnight show
at the Slot Swamp Casino.
I'll get you guys
in, half price.
- What kind of show?
- Ah. Check this out.
Boom!
Oh, shit! Yo!
"Rock Hard Rod
"South Jersey's premier X-rated
rock'n'roll impersonator".
That's not as
crazy as it sounds.
I mean, most of the songs
are just about masturbation,
and we all do that, right?
Yeah!
Actually, Rod, I don't think
we'll be able to make the show,
but we'll buy you a drink
if you put your
jerk-off hand down.
You drive a hard bargain, sir.
So, you do a bunch of jerk-off
songs to make a living?
Yeah, I do a whole act.
Wall-to-wall,
top-to-bottom jizz jams!
You'll be surprised at how much
material lends itself to it.
I mean, 'Beat It',
Michael Jackson.
'Wind Beneath My
Wings', Bette Midler.
- Anything by The Strokes!
- Mm.
Yeah, and I'm the
only one in the world
that's figured it out.
Yeah, it's almost
hard to believe.
Oh, Barry, my dear friends here
will buy me that
drink after all.
Oh, yeah, I also do impressions.
You name it, I can do it. I'm
a trained actor, you know.
- I got a good one for you, Rod.
- Yeah?
Why don't you do the guy that
gets the fuck out of here
before I call security?
No, no, no, it's
okay. It's okay.
I think we'd like to see this.
And go ahead and
bring him that drink.
Ha! And the calamari, Bar-ry!
Dickhead! Love that guy.
So, who do you
guys want me to do?
You, er, I don't know,
you like Owen Wilson?
- Sure.
- We love Owen Wilson.
- Yeah, that's fine.
- I would love some Owen Wilson.
Wow!
Where in the history
of our relationship
did you think I couldn't
do an impersonation
of somebody as
adorable as The Big O?
That is an excellent Owen
Wilson. That's a good Owen.
- It's okay.
- Wow.
- It's not that good.
- Thank you. Oh, er...
- I'm just...
- Calamari's here, man.
All right, an
oldie but a goodie.
Take a look at this tit, kid.
Probably the last one
you're ever going to see
for the rest of your life.
Don't drink no more, Momma.
You're real mean
when you drink stuff.
Quit your bitchin',
ya sloppy punk.
You wanna know how
you was hatched?
Your old man was
basting my rump roast
and some of it dribbled
into my woolly burger.
You know what that makes you?
A shit baby!
That's right, you're
nothing but shit,
and you always will be!
Is... is that from
'Downton Abbey'?
That was, er
just a little skit
from my childhood.
Er, yeah...
I think it's time to hit
the tables, boys. Huh?
Right on. Where are we going?
Copper Bonnet's the only
place on the boardwalk
with 50-cent tables.
Not as many hookers,
but they're friendlier
they don't get weirded out
when you just wanna
brush their hair.
Yeah, Rod, I think we're just
going to stay around here.
Oh, here's great. I'm friends
with the bartender, Barry.
Hey, Hard-on Ronnie, we
are doing our own thing.
We got our thing going on,
and we're probably just gonna
leave you.
Okay, I can take a hint.
You guys look at me
and you just see another
scumbag impersonator, right?
Thanks for understanding,
man. You're a good dude.
- What the hell, man?
- What?
You didn't have to
be so mean about it.
What? I wasn't... What did I do?
What? Was I being an asshole?
Well, you called him
'Hard-on Ronnie'.
It's 'Rock Hard Rod'.
Ohh, right, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know Weird Al Wankovic
would be so sensitive.
Rod! Hey, Rod!
These are mine.
I just wanted to say sorry
for what happened back there.
My friends
they just want it to be some
kind of reunion, just us,
but that wasn't cool, so...
Whatever, I get it.
Happens all the time.
You guys come in to AC
with your Toyota Avalons and
your anesthesiologist money.
Strutting around like
a bunch of big shots.
Let me tell you something.
We lost Joan Rivers
and Michael Jackson
because of you fuckers, okay?
None of us are
anesthesiologists.
Not here for the convention?
No.
Hey, I get it, man.
You look at me and see another
asshole sideshow freak, right?
- Not at all.
- I'm more than that.
I'm a damn good actor.
You'll see.
Shit!
Who are they?
Crazy fans I was
trying to avoid.
Anyway, I gotta run.
Hey, take my card.
Remember that name.
I promise it's going to mean
something to you some day.
I would not be surprised.
Oh! Jeez.
Oh, my God! Yes! Yes!
- Give me my money right now!
- JT! JT!
Not now, Dean. I'm on fire!
And for once I'm going to
leave Atlantic City a winner!
Susan's in labor.
This was a bad idea. I
knew this was a bad idea.
Don't friggin' do that, man.
You're 'Monday morning
quarterbacking' right now.
Who could've figured she'd go
into labor six weeks early?
Six weeks! My baby's going
to be born six weeks early.
- Is he going to be okay?
- The baby's going to fine.
Babies are born six
weeks early all the time.
I was born six weeks early.
Oh, shit! Go, go, go! Go!
Susan Levine. What
room is she in?
- Levine?
- Yeah, Levine.
Ah, here we are. She
and the baby are in 208.
She had the baby?!
Oh, baby Whitaker.
This was not the birth
plan I had for you.
I wanted you born on the
shores of Goosewing Beach.
You know what my birth plan was?
For you to actually be here.
Why isn't he wearing a shirt?
I'm having skin-to-skin
contact with my son, Leona.
It's a proven way of regulating
a newborn baby's temperature,
and it calms him, thank you.
Don't blankets do that?
Oh, he is such a little peanut.
We should call him Shrimpy,
he's such a little peanut.
Please don't call my
grandson 'Shrimpy'.
Shrimps are the
cockroaches of the sea.
6lbs is pretty good for a month
and a half early, right, Mom?
Oh, he's perfect. He's perfect.
I want to know where the
hell you guys were tonight.
We called every
hospital in Albany
and there was no record
of a Ricky Stanicky.
Yeah, and the last
thing you tell me
is you got to go see
him because he's got...
What kind of cancer?
Er... anal.
I thought it was testicular.
It was testicular, but
then it spread to his anus.
Yeah, they had to remove it.
They removed his asshole?
Er... just the outer lip part.
Outer lip part? What is
he, a fucking baboon?
Come on, Wes. What's
going on here?
Where were you?
Okay.
It was a lie.
It's all been a lie.
What's a lie?
The whole Ricky Stanicky thing.
It was, uh...
It's bullshit.
JT, what's he talking about?
Yeah, Dean, what is
he talking about?
He's saying...
Ricky Stanicky lied to us.
Okay? There was no cancer.
When we got to the hospital,
Ricky was standing out front
with a bottle of
champagne and a limo.
Turns out that it was
his five-year anniversary
being cancer free.
So he pretended to have cancer
just so he could celebrate
not having cancer?
I... Yeah.
It's typical Rick.
You know, he's got such
a weird sense of humour.
- He does, yep.
- Okay...
He was in Albany meeting with
the Give Green Foundation,
and I guess he just wanted
to celebrate with us.
So he pranked us.
The Give Green Foundation?
Yeah. You've heard of them,
Leona. They're wonderful.
Wait, why didn't you call us
and tell us that he was okay?
And why was your
phone off all night?
Oh, baby, it was a whirlwind.
Ricky took us to a
stand-up comedy show
and they didn't allow
cell phones, so...
And after that, the
night turned into a blur.
You know I wanted to be
here for you for this.
I wanted this more than you did.
Oh, get that baby off that thing
and give him to his mother.
Oh, that is disgusting!
No. It's dangerous to
detach. Let him suck it out.
Yeah. Good boy.
This hippie-dippy crap.
Well, I'm certainly going
to give Ricky an earful
when I see him at
the bris next week.
What's a bris?
It's the circumcision ceremony.
Oh! It sounds like a soup.
You know, I doubt he's going
to be able to be there, sadly.
Why not?
He has work in Nairobi.
No, he doesn't.
Wes is helping him out
with some fundraiser
in Providence on Saturday night.
I remember telling...
I told you.
Yeah.
Great. Well, the bris is on
Sunday, so he can make it.
Yeah, maybe. Unless he's got
to fly out early on Sunday.
Well, that's ridiculous.
Come on, if he's in
town on Saturday,
why wouldn't he spend an extra
day to meet baby Whitaker?
Yeah, why wouldn't he?
You're absolutely right. He
should stay an extra day.
In fact, I'm going
to make sure of it.
What the fuck, Dean?
What did you want
me to say, man?
They were all staring at me.
I look at you. You've got
baby Whitaker nursing on you.
Horrible name, by the way.
- I just...
- You panicked.
I panicked?!
What are you talk...?! You're
the one who almost outed us!
And you made plans
with Stanicky!
Ricky Stanicky is not a
one-man show. You know that!
It's a fragile fabric, man.
Ricky Stanicky is only to
be used as a three-man team.
Huh.
So, what about the
golf rounds with Ricky
that JT charged to your company?
- You weren't there.
- What?
I charged the rounds of golf
because you didn't
have any money.
Seriously, Wes. What
happened in there, man?
Look.
Keith's been on my ass
about finding a job,
and sleeping all day,
and pumicing my
foot-skin over the sink.
What the fuck does this
have to do with Stanicky?
I needed a break!
Keith can be very oppressive.
Sometimes I feel like I'm living
in a gay 'Handmaid's Tale'.
So I went to a pot farm,
where they make cannabis milk.
You played the Stanicky
card to get pot milk?
You never had milk
like this before.
- No, I haven't.
- It's delicious.
I hope!
They must feed these
lucky cows weed all day,
because when they
milk 'em - boom!
Dream cream!
What did you just say?
Dream cream.
Huh!
We're fucked. We're
majorly fucked.
You know, we don't
deserve this shit.
All we did was tell one lie.
Hundreds and hundreds of
times over many, many years.
Hey, maybe they'll forget
that they invited
Stanicky to the bris.
They'll be so busy with
the family and friends,
and cutting of penises.
They're not going to forget
they invited him, Wes.
I got it. My boy Jonesy.
He works for one of
those online obituaries.
We could kill Stanicky off.
I like that. Let's kill his ass.
Put your hands down, shit nuts.
Obituaries give details.
Friends, family, cemeteries.
Plus then everyone's going
to want to go to the funeral.
Okay, Dean, your
negativity is not helping.
Or, uh, we could go
do my original plan,
and tell everybody the truth.
Shut your mouth. Shut
your stupid mouth.
We're not telling the truth.
There'll be no truth told, okay?
We're going to do
the right thing here.
Some would argue that
telling the truth
is the right thing to do.
Yeah - assholes!
Let me remind you guys of what
the truth is, dream cream.
Last night, when I
was in New Jersey
secretly partying my face off
at the Marc Rebillet concert,
my wife was giving
birth to my son.
Alone! Okay?
And if the truth does come
out, my marriage is over.
And later, if my son finds
out, that's over too.
Is that what you want, Wes?
You want to destroy an
entire family, huh? Huh?
- Huh?
- Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.
What if we hire an
actor to play Stanicky?
We give him the whole run-down.
Tell him everything
he needs to know.
Okay, okay, I like
this. Keep going.
We could give him
the bible, right?
He studies it for a few days,
and then he comes to the
bris for a couple of hours
and he plays Ricky Stanicky.
Okay, but where are we
going to find an actor?
Gary Polisner! He's in
that Red Robin commercial.
- He is?
- Yeah.
He's that dude that goes,
"Seconds on steak fries?"
"Uh, yeah!"
- That's Gary?
- That's Gary.
- Good for him!
- Good for him.
I love those commercials.
Guys, minor wrinkle
Gary's dating Carly,
Erin's cousin.
Oh, Cousin It?
That girl with the hair
that touches the floor?
Yeah, but don't worry.
I know an actor
that nobody knows.

Great show, Rod.
Good crowd.
Hey, Rod. Those guys
are out there again.
Hey, we need more beer mugs.
Rod Rimestead, trained
actor. How can I help you?
Yeah, Dean, I remember you.
A gig?
Let me... Er, you know what?
Let me just check my schedule.
Yeah, man. Looks like I'm free.
And so our feathered friend
still has not gotten
off the golf ball
that Dr. Dominic DiPasquale
of East Greenwich
hit near this green side
bunker six days ago.
But you can count on
Channel 6 to be here
until this exciting saga ends.
Or, you can go to Channel6.com
and log onto our live duck-cam.
Can you believe I
spent three years
in journalism grad
school for this crap?
Are you kidding? I love
this story. It's fun.
Don't patronize me.
Okay. It sucks. I'm
embarrassed for you.
Thank you.
You're really sweet to hang
out with me, though, honestly.
- Are you kidding?
- Thank you.
Who else gets the chance
to watch history unfold?
Oh, wait.
You know who's looking forward
to meeting Ricky tomorrow?
Yeah, Leona. I know.
Uh-uh. Carly.
Carly with the hair?
Mm-hm, my cousin, yeah.
What happened to Gary Polisner?
Oh, you know, they're together,
but she follows
Ricky on Instagram.
- Loves his charity work.
- Hmm.
That duck's not going anywhere.
Let's go get some lunch.
Come back in an hour.
I would, but I can't. I'm on
duck duty for four more hours.
Unless she gets
up, I'm stuck here.
Unless she gets up, huh.
No! Paul!
Paul! Paul, come back here.
Hey, Paul. Paul, get back here.
- Paul!
- Oh, my God!
Paul!
Oh, my God!
Come on! Paul!
Paul! Get out of there!
Hold your breath, Paul!
Hang in there, buddy!
- Bad duck!
- Ow!
Dean, do something! You have
to pull him out of there.
Let's take a rain check
on the lunch, all right?
Sorry.
Such an asshole!
I just want to go on
the record and say
this is a really bad idea.
Why? He does impersonations
of famous people.
How hard could it be
to impersonate someone
- that no one's ever met before?
- Yeah.
We're going to be fine. This
is going to be totally fine.
- You gave him the bible, right?
- Yeah.
- Good.
- And the Stanicky phone,
everything on it, his Insta.
I FaceTimed him. I took him
through everything, man.
For a sloppy drunk,
he's a real pro
- when it comes to this stuff.
- Fine.
Oh, Jesus.
Please don't be the trash bag,
please don't be the trash bag...
It's the trash bag. Oh.
- Dude.
- What the hell?
- Hey, boys.
- What are you on?
Huh?
Don't give me that shit.
What drugs are you on?
None.
Don't lie to us. You're
sweating like a tweaker.
I'm sweating because
I'm not on anything.
I've been cold-turkeying
the booze for three days.
Smashes my world
record by three days.
What? You can't quit
drinking right now, man.
We need you in top form!
I can't drink. Ricky Stanicky's
in the program, remember?
Right, yeah, yeah.
Ricky's been clean and sober
for the past seven years.
Who cares?! People
relapse all the time.
- Yeah.
- What are you...?
What are you doing?
Wallet. Mouth.
Oh, oh, oh!
Yeah, I've seen this
on 'Intervention'.
He's having withdrawals.
The leather will calm him down.
- Relax. It's okay.
- Yeah.
You okay?
I had a couple of those
in the plane - they pass.
The nice fella I walked off
the plane with, he helped me.
What fella?
He was just... he was just
here. You didn't see him?
Curly eyes. Long blonde
lips. He talks with a limp.
All right, uh,
how about we just take
a little whiff of vodka,
you know, just to
take the edge off?
- Yeah. A little bit.
- Yeah?
No, you hired me to play the
role of a sober gentleman.
I'm going to do so the
only way I know how
with artistic integrity.
What is that? Is
somebody boiling lobster?
Boiling what? Oh, Rod.
Oh.
It's not what you think it is.
It's just piss.
Oh, thank God.
I can't believe you guys
picked me up in this thing.
What?
This gas-guzzling,
carbon-emitting Earth-killer.
If your people see me
pull up in this thing,
my cover is blown for sure.
He's right again. Ricky
Stanicky's a tree hugger.
We helped him clean up the
Chesapeake Bay, remember?
The Pats/Ravens game.
That was a good game.
- Who's that?
- Nobody.
All right, who's the bank? I
want all my cheese up front.
SAG minimum - $983 a day,
meal penalty after six hours.
Dude, there is no way
you're in the union.
We'll give you half now
and half when you're done.
That's a no-bueno. I want
all my cake up front.
It's not negotiable.
Okay, then, that's a bueno.
Guys, we can't take him to
the bris smelling like this.
Wes, can you please
take Mr. Stanicky
over to your place
and shower him off
and then bring him over to JT's?
It's 'Ricky'. Mr. Stanicky
is my fake father's name.
Um, hey, I don't think that's
going to be a good idea.
My shower curtains, they're
all mouldy and shit.
Wes, stop being a douche bag.
Erin and I have to get
there early and help set up.
So we're going to be there
way before you. Just...
I don't know, do what you can,
make him presentable, please.
Presentable? How dare you.
You guys are supposed
to be my best friends.
You should be fighting over
who gets to hose me down.
Hey, grand-mal piss-pants.
Shut the fuck up, okay?
We wouldn't be in
this predicament
if you didn't show up smelling
like a nursing-home mattress.
Wow. This is a hostile set.
Thanks for that, man.
Starting to feel a
little human again.
Yeah. Hey, let me
ask you something.
You're a raging
alcoholic, right?
Yeah.
Well, then how do
you stay so ripped?
- Roids. Shit-ton of roids.
- Hmm.
I got addicted to those too.
God, they're good.
Wow. Gay much?
Yeah. I was really
feeling it that day.
Oh, so this is your, um...
Partner, Keith. Mmm.
Of course.
By the way, I kind of
told him that you were bi.
What? Why?
Because it'd be
weird if you weren't
since we dated.
We dated? You and me?
Was that in the bible?
- I missed that.
- No, it's not in there.
Why the hell wasn't
it in the bible?
Well, 'cause I couldn't
tell the guys. All right?
Look, look, I didn't
know how things would go
on my first date with Keith.
So I told him I was seeing
this dude named Ricky Stanicky,
in case I needed an out.
But we hit it off and
I told him we broke up.
Okay, no problem.
Unfortunately, Keith's still
a little threatened by you.
Okay, spill the beans. I
got to know everything.
- What did you tell him we did?
- What do you mean?
Cut the crap. You
know what I mean.
Did we play Winnie the
Pooh finds a honey stick?
- What's that?
- Munchkins in a cave?
Upside-down barber?
Shaved biscuits and gravy?
- No.
- Old faceful?
No! We just went on
a couple of dates.
Oh. I guess I didn't
do it for you.
You're no trophy
either, beagle ears.
Hey, what's this?
Oh, it's just this...
this children's book thing
that I've been tinkering with.
Hey, there he is! Our
mohel, Rabbi Greenberg.
You can call me
Rabbi Gigglebird.
The Rabbi does
stand-up sometimes
at the Comedy Connection.
I may not be able to eat ham,
but I can certainly be one!
Cheese puffs, anyone?
Oh, no, we mohels, we
prefer those little weenies.
Ba-doomp-pow!
Oh, no...
Listen. Listen.
My services here today
are complimentary,
just so you know, all right?
I consider this a
mitzvah. All right?
I don't want any money,
but I'm keeping the tip!
- They just keep on coming, huh?
- Yeah, they don't stop.
- All right.
- You're hungry, I bet.
Always.
Please. You got to fill
up before you... Right?
- Go. It's all you, baby.
- Yeah, yeah. Go get it. Dig in.
Back off the vodka, lady.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Can I get a gin and tonic?
And let's make it a double.
What the fuck is
Summerhayes doing here?
I invited him.
- Oh, my God.
- Babe, why would you do that?
Because he's your boss.
Yeah. I don't want to
hang out with my boss.
Why not? You invited him to
the baby shower, shithead.
That's different. This is
a cock-cutting ceremony.
I don't want him here.
Jesus Christ, you're being
weird. Just go say hi.
Both of you. Go.
Great. This is just great.
Now if Stanicky shits the
bed, we lose our jobs.
God, where is he? He
should be here by now.
Explain it again.
It's a children's
story about these seeds
that are flying in the breeze,
and all they want to do is
reach the top of this mountain.
But there's this one little
seed who gets blown back
to the bottom of the mountain,
and she's all like, "Fuck!"
But when it starts to rain,
all the water will start
to flow down the side of the
mountain straight to her.
So she'll sprout and
she'll grow and grow
to be the biggest tree of all,
even bigger than the ones
on top of the mountain.
The message being,
you can be great in life,
no matter where you start.
Hot, wet shit.
What-what... what are
you talking about?
Come on, man,
you're not a farmer.
What the hell do you
know about seeds, right?
And the message is absurd.
Poor kids turn into trees?
It doesn't make any sense.
- You're right.
- Right?
It is stupid. It's stupid!
What the fuck was I
thinking, man? Yeah.
I should just give up.
Whoa. No. That's
not what I said.
I said this is crap,
because it's not authentic.
Doesn't mean you gotta give up.
Let me tell you a story, cowboy.
A few years back,
I had an X-rated dog
show at the Showboat.
I had these two mutts that
could bang missionary style.
Oh, yeah, you heard
me right. Missionary!
Face-to-face. Real deal.
It was kind of
touching, actually.
Then Atlantic City gets all woke
and they won't let 'em
pump on stage anymore.
I tried doing the show with
two guys in dog suits, but
the magic just wasn't there.
You know what I mean?
- No.
- My point is, I failed.
But did I give up? Heck no.
I just had to ask
myself, what do I love?
And then it was easy
singing, performing and
telling filthy jokes.
And that is when Rock
Hard Rod was born.
You, sir, have just found out
your dogs can no longer
bang missionary style.
Now you got to ask
yourself, what do you love?
- What do I love?
- Yeah.
Ah...
Yeah, I... I like ceramic owls?
Uh... I love fog.
I love fog! I love it.
Er, is there anything
that you like
that a regular human being
can relate to on any level?
- I like Christmas.
- Christmas, Christmas!
Perfect! Yes! Everybody
loves Christmas.
Yeah, well, not everybody.
Keith is not a big
fan of it these days.
- He doesn't love Christmas?
- Well, he used to love it.
But, I mean,
ever since his parents found
out that we were dating,
they haven't really
invited him over.
- That sucks.
- Yeah.
Which is their loss, you know.
No "Jerky of the
Month Club" for them.
Ha.
I just wish there was a
holiday tradition for us.
You know, like Christmas is
the gayest holiday anyway, man.
You know, you bedazzle
a tree with tinsel.
And why does Santa have
to be such a fat shit?
Couldn't he be ripped? Couldn't
he be jacked? You know?
Can the elves have
ordered him a Peloton
or a yoga mat or something?
Ra-pum-pum-pum.
Now that is authentic!
Yeah. A Christmas story for us.
Thanks for coming, Ted.
I know a bris isn't
exactly your cup of tea.
Oh, no, we're happy
that you invited us, JT.
This is exactly what Ted needed.
He's been so obsessed with
this World River merger.
Yeah.
Circumcision parties are my
go-to when I need to relax.
Where's Gary? I
thought he was coming.
He has his improv
class at Trinity,
but I think he'll be here soon.
Have you guys seen
his new commercial?
Yeah. Yeah.
- He got off.
- Who got off?
My big story I'm
covering this week.
You're covering a trial?
No, real reporters
get to do that.
I'm covering a vicious
duck sitting on a golf ball
- at Wannamoisett Country Club.
- Oh.
You're just paying
your dues, right?
You're going to get a shot
at the big story soon.
Thanks, babe.
He's not coming, is he?
- Who would you be referring to?
- Oh, don't give me that.
Ricky Stanicky.
Where the hell is he?
Oh, he'll be here. This
is just typical Ricky.
He's... he's always late.
Hmm. Well, I'll believe
it when I see it.
Leona, come on. Why
wouldn't he come?
Probably for the same reason
that he didn't bother to show
up for JT and Susan's wedding.
Sorry he didn't think my
wedding was more important
than digging out hurricane
victims in the Bahamas.
Ooh.
Ha, ha! The old
Bahamian hurricane.
Jackie, tell me
about Ricky Stanicky.
I mean, if they were
such good friends,
you must have met him a bunch
when they were kids, right?
Oh, sure. I... I met
all of JT's friends.
Really?
Do you have any specific
memories of him?
Well, I remember he was a
handful, that's for sure.
I mean, every time this
one got in trouble,
Stanicky was somehow behind it.
He was a... a little
devil, that Ricky.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Wow!
That doesn't sound
like the same guy
who works for Bono in Africa
and builds orphanages in Peru.
That's 'cause he's born again.
- Ah.
- He had that epiphany in rehab.
Remember I told you about that?
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, people change, Leona.
Why are you grilling my
mom? She's not on trial.
Because I want you to admit
that Ricky Stanicky
does not exist.
Hey, mishpocha!
Let's get down to bris-ness!
Oh, yes! Yeah-ah!
You made it!
The boys are back!
- All right.
- Jackie!
Ricky?
Oh, you look unbelievable.
You're still a MILF.
Oh, my God.
Look at you. Oh, you
haven't changed a bit.
The mystery man in the flesh.
Well, churn my butter
with a slippery stick.
I finally get to
meet Erin Harford.
You're even more
beautiful in person
than the pictures Dean's
always sending me.
You send him pictures of me?
Oh, tasteful, of course.
Even the nudes.
Seriously, the guy
doesn't shut up about you.
What were you saying
about her last week?
It was, um...
Ah! The more I look at her,
the more I realize how
much there is to see.
- Aw. Babe.
- And who do we have here?
Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hair!
I'm Carly, I'm Erin's cousin.
No need to shout, bullhorn!
And I am the woman who had
to give birth all alone
because you tricked her
husband into going to Albany.
Oh, my God, Susan, I'm so sorry.
You know how much grief your
old man's been giving me?
For the record, I had no
idea it was your baby shower.
I just wanted to celebrate
my new lease on life
with my oldest, dearest friends.
Then little Whitaker
comes along...
God, I love that name.
And then I just ruin everything.
I just... Again, my
sincerest apologies.
No, you know, it...
It's okay. I know you've
been through a lot, so...
Hell, yeah, they lopped off
one of my nuts, for starters.
Oh, you are still a handful!
Well, half a handful.
Ricky...
Okay, Rico! Hey, let's
go show you around. Huh?
Aren't you going
to Introduce me?
Uh, we'll be right back.
Stay away from that
woman at all costs, okay?
That's Susan's mother.
She's bad news.
Jesus.
Hey, if anyone asks about
the shaking, just say,
"I have low blood sugar
and I had a Red Bull."
Stopping you there.
I don't appreciate
line readings.
What?
So, I lift up the mosquito net
and, sure enough,
Bono's in there.
Plowing Mrs. Bono
like a potato field.
Really? The Bono?
Yeah. Givin' the missus the old
Irish shillelagh, as it were.
So I'm standing
there embarrassed.
And then they go, "It's okay."
"Watch us, we like it."
Is that an Irish thing?
I don't think so. But I
wouldn't put it past them.
Hey, the guy saved ten
million people from starving.
So, if he wants to let people
watch him corn-beef his wife's
cabbage, who am I to stop him?
You know who has the best
corn-beef in town? Geoff's.
And it isn't even really a deli.
I don't think that's
the kind of corn-beef
he's talking about, Ginny.
Oh, man, all this food
talk is making me hungry.
- Ricky, have you eaten yet?
- Dean.
You haven't introduced
me to Indiana Jones here.
Yeah, of course.
Ted, this is Ricky
Stanicky, my good friend.
Uh, Ricky, this is Ted
Summerhayes, my boss.
Ted, nice to meet you.
Digging the suit and
the seedlings, man.
The seedlings?
The hair plugs.
They're new, right?
What?
No. This is my hair.
Ha! Yeah, just like a
doll's hair is her hair.
That's good. That's good.
So, Ted, you're one of
those big banker guys, eh?
One of those guys out there
helping those
billionaires get richer
and then floating around on
your big swinging super-yachts,
leaving everybody else
struggling to make ends meet
in their little dinghies.
- No. No, no, no. Not at all...
- First of all,
we sell financial services
to independent investors,
and anyone who's
willing to pay for them
is welcome to share
in the benefits.
Whatever helps you sleep
at night, Ebenezer.
Uh, if memory serves me,
Ebenezer Scrooge ends up
becoming the hero of that story.
- It's Ricky, right?
- Yeah.
I'm wondering, Ricky, are you
always such a bust-out asshole,
right out of the gate?
Only when I'm talking
to the type of guy
who can make a real
difference in this world.
Ted, Ricky's been
working overseas
for the last decade
on non-profits.
So at least he walks the walk.
Well, that's nice,
but he's obviously getting
his financial information
from 'The Huffington Post'.
No, actually, I've been reading
the 'San Francisco
Chronicle' lately.
I've been following
your potential merger
with World River.
It's interesting, unexpected.
Okay, hey, uh, there's
a ton of people inside
- that still wanna meet you.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'd like to hear this.
Unexpected, how?
Oh, come on.
They're the yin, and you
got that big old yang.
It's a perfect fit.
In what way?
Well, you're old
school. They're new age.
You got common sense, but
they got radical new ideas.
For my money, I'm
going common sense
over radical new ideas all day.
I'm sure the people in Portland
and San Francisco agree.
And that's what
makes you guys great.
But they're pretty good too.
But, together, you guys
would be unstoppable.
This merger could make a real
difference in this world, Ted.
A real difference.
Yin and yang, huh?
Oh, don't mind if I do. Thanks.
Where the hell did you hear
about the World River deal?
They were all over your Twitter.
I just did a little research.
What are you doing
on my Twitter?
Dean, I told you I'm an actor.
When I walk into a room,
I want to know exactly
where I came from
and what every single person
in that room's been doing.
That's what all the greats do.
Matt Damon actually bought a zoo
before he filmed
'We Bought a Zoo'.
I don't think that's true.
You don't believe me?
Take it up with Reddit.
Oh, if you'll excuse me,
I got to go have
a word with Keith.
What? How do you know Keith?!
We're in a weird
love-triangle thing.
Look, all I'm saying is I
hope there's no hard feelings.
Because let's face it, you won.
But I'm happy for you.
You guys make a fabulous couple.
I'm done with his ass.
Look, I still love the guy,
but I'm tired of
working 60 hours a week
while he sits around not doing
anything to improve himself.
I just...
I can't be with a person
like that anymore.
What... what about his
writing? That's work.
What writing?
The book he's working on.
He never told me he
was writing a book.
He sure looks a lot
older than you guys.
- Really?
- Mmm.
Yeah, well, he is,
by a couple years.
You know, we were like
little brothers to him.
Hmm, no, I mean, like more
than a couple of years.
Well, it's because
of the drugs - he...
You know, he was a huge
partier, back in the day.
I mean, like hard drugs.
Huffing glue. Like, the works.
I mean, that'll suck the
youth right out of your face.
It does.
Yeah, that was all
before he went on
- the straight and narrow.
- Hmm.
Oh, look at them. Look
how happy they are.
- I told you.
- It's an easy thing.
- I don't see happiness.
- What?
I see fear and anxiety.
Fear of what?
Of the responsibility of it all.
What do they even get out of it?
What do they get out
of having a family?
- Yeah.
- Come on.
I mean, I get it on
paper. Sure, right.
But in reality, having a
kid is fear and anxiety
with periodic moments
of crushing pain.
And then you get
bitter and resentful
and eventually just... mean.
At least that's how
it was at my house.
You realize that's
the most you've ever
told me about your childhood?
Look, he is kind
of lost right now,
but just give him a little
time, he'll figure it out.
I've given him plenty of time.
I think you need to
step back in, Ricky.
Be there for him.
Ease the blow a little
when I drop him.
Oh, hey, Keith, slow down.
Take it from me,
relationships like yours,
they don't come
around that often.
They just don't.
My own mother was
married six times.
She never found happiness.
An incredible sex life,
but she was filled up
with everything but joy.
You really want to
give up on this?
May not come back around.
Ricky!
I understand you spent
a lot of time in Kenya
working with the Give
Green organization.
Yeah, yeah, good peeps.
Green peeps, yeah.
I'm interested in what
your experience was there,
because, you know, I've
been reading up on them
and they're a really
intriguing organization.
Yeah, you know what?
I was just trying to find one
of those cheese-puff trays.
- I'll show you where they are.
- Right, but before you do,
can you tell me
about Charlie Sennet?
Huh?
Charlie Sennet, the journalist
who started Give Green
and is still hands on.
I mean, did you get to meet him?
What do you think of
his mission statement?
Is it tenable?
Oh, yeah, of course
it's tenable.
Elevenable, twelve able...
I mean, it's infinite
really, right?
Ha-ha.
I mean, I'm intrigued
by their policy
of direct charitable donations.
You know, personally, I think
donations need to
be conditional.
What do you think?
Uh, you know what?
It's group photo time.
Group photo time.
Group photo! Come on,
let's make some memories!
Yeah. Yeah.
You have no idea what I'm
talking about, do you, Ricky?
Maybe he just doesn't want to
talk shop at a bris, Leona.
Or maybe he's a fraud.
Are you a fraud, sir?
I'll tell you what's
fraudulent, Leona.
Yeah?
The perception that the
program at Give Green
needs to be conditional.
They choose to offer
unconditional cash transfers
for two reasons.
First, empowering poor people
to make their own choices?
Well, that advances their
core value of respect.
Second, imposing
conditions requires
expensive monitoring and
enforcement structures
that could raise administrative
costs as high as 63%.
The existing empirical
evidence comparing the impact
of conditional to
unconditional cash transfers
shows that these added costs
simply do not produce
commensurate benefits.
I wonder where those
cheese-puff trays went off to.
Did you want a
cheese puff, Leona?
No, thank you.
Huh, so what are these?
Glazed dates stuffed
with Asiago cheese
and pickled herring.
Don't mind if I don't.
No problem.
- That was amazing.
- Unbelievable.
Where the hell did you
learn all that stuff?
Gotta buy the zoo, baby.
What? Who's that...?
Gary Polisner's here.
$8,000. It's on lease, but
that's how much it's worth.
Oh.
Hey, Polisner!
Hey! Well you move along,
I'll talk to you later on.
Get over here, hey?
Had to park my Cybertruck
in the next county.
What, you too cheap for a valet?
- Crap! I know that guy.
- What? What guy?
The guy standing
with Hairy Krishna.
I saved you a bagel with lox.
I asked for an everything
bagel. That's a nothing bagel.
Hey, you got any
booze in this place?
Yeah.
Let me guess, it's a cash bar.
Oh, shit!
Go up the stairs.
Go into the garage.
Just get in there. Don't
come out until I tell you.
All right? Go, go, go, go, go.
Fuck.
And as you can tell, I
actually don't sweat...
What the fuck are you saying?
Ricky knows Polisner.
- How?
- How the hell do I know?
They're both actors. Maybe
they crossed paths somehow.
We got to get
Polisner out of here.
He just got here.
Goddamn it.
We could put him in a K-hole.
What's that?
Dose him with Ketamine.
Yeah, great idea. I'll just run
down to CVS and grab a bottle.
No need.
Why the hell do
you have Ketamine?
Well, sometimes after
a hard day, you...
You K-hole yourself.
I could see that. Where
do you get these things?
- My grandmother died.
- Guys!
We're not K-holing anyone.
Stop being such a
fucking wang, Dean. Okay?
We're going to get
him a little drowsy
and then put him in a cab.
Are you guys serious right now?
You want to drug
the Red Robin guy?
What other fucking
choice do we have?
"Seconds on steak
fries? Uh, yeah!"
First take. Everyone applauded.
That's the one they used, too.
Fuck it. Let's K-hole the prick.
- This is it.
- Yep, let's go. Let's go.
- All right.
- No way!
That's right, I hit.
That's right, I hit.
- Let's go for two.
- He's got you believing.
Come on, baby. Come on!
Bad throw. Bad throw.
Bad throw! Dude, your
foot came off the couch.
- Oh, hey, Gare.
- Oh, hey, Dean, what's up?
Hey, uh, you guys seen my
Red Robin commercial yet?
- We did. Yeah, we did.
- Yeah. Shit went national.
Yeah, I love that.
Thinking of getting me
a sweet kimono dragon.
Isn't it 'komodo'?
No, not the one
I'm getting, right?
- Oh, yeah!
- Off market. All cash.
- What are you losers doing?
- We're playing a game
where if you catch
three peanuts in a row,
you get 20 bucks
from each of us.
Why, you want in?
- Fuck yeah!
- Oh?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Okay.
Man, I'll kick all your asses.
Step right up and
get behind the hat.
- No cheating.
- I got this.
- Here we go.
- You focused?
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Boom!
Wow!
Relax, Gare. Little
bit of luck there.
- Okay.
- Get low.
- Ohh! Yeah.
- Ohh! Yes!
I'm just as good as Wes at
catching nuts in my mouth.
Oh. Right. 'Cause I'm gay.
Yeah.
I'm so happy we're doing this.
Okay, this one's
for all the marbles.
All right, Gary, let's
go, buddy. You ready?
Ready? One, two...
Three...
Ba-doomp-pow! All net!
I think I ate a bad one.
Bitter.
My sweet boy.
May God make you like
Ephraim and Manasseh.
May God bless you
and watch over you.
Shouldn't we be stopping this?
Don't worry, we got about a
half hour before it kicks in.
Hey, I figured out
how I know him.
He's in those Red
Robin commercials.
"Seconds on steak
fries? Uh, yeah!"
Dude, that was great.
You should be an actor.
So you guys have
never met before?
- No, but...
- Yeah, just a big fan.
- All right, it's time.
- Okay.
Oh
we're going to
need a steak knife.
Ha!
Wow! Is this his bris
or his bar mitzvah?
Okay, little vinegar... Whitaker
has skanctified us with the
commandiments...
com... condiments
comma... commandments...
With the commander-ments.
With the commandments. Oy...
He's seems confused.
What the hell? Is he drunk?
I don't know. I saw him
eat a peanut earlier.
Maybe he's having a reaction?
- Man, you said half an hour.
- I don't know.
I think I might have
developed a tolerance.
Okay.
And he hasht given us
the command to
circumvision!
Hi, fishy-fishy!
Oh, to fishy-fishy!
Mommy, I don't want to
go to school tomorrow.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! He's
allergic to peanuts.
What did she say?
She said he's allergic to penis.
Oh, he's certainly in
the wrong business.
Ba-doomp-pow!
Oh, my God.
He's only half circumcised.
Take the kid to the hospital.
- Yes, definitely a hospital.
- I could call an ambulance.
No, this has to be done now.
Let Ricky finish it.
Ricky? What? No!
No. Are you insane?
He used to work for Bono's
foundation in Africa,
circumcising adults.
Aw.
Yeah, he did. But
that was so long ago.
Plus, it's got to be
way easier to circumcise
a gorgeous African
penis than a baby penis.
You would think.
I can do it.
Uh, Ricky... Ricky! This is
a baby we're talking about.
A real baby. Are you sure?
Yeah. Yeah. It's not like
I'm cutting a diamond.
I'm sure I can pull
it off. Pun intended.
No. No! We need a
certified mohel, right?
- Right.
- I'll just look one up on Yelp.
What? No! No Yelping.
No, we already have a mohel.
He's already said the tefilah.
We just need to let
Ricky finish it off.
Mom, no, I'm going to
take him to a hospital,
where doctors work.
Does anyone here
care that my grandson
is laying there
half circumcised?
And we're done!
Just a little off
the ol' Tiparillo.
- Huh.
- Who's next?
Summerhayes, get over here so
I can snip off that turtleneck.
Stanicky, you are unbelievable.
- All right, this is yours.
- No.
Oh, my God, Ricky!
Yes!
Ricky Stanicky, you are
even better than advertized.
Ah, Susan, it's just a
pleasure to help you out.
By the way, the kid's got a
good-looking schmeckel on him.
Real hog barrel. He's going to
have some fun with that thing.
- Takes after his papa.
- Yeah.
Ricky, do you really
have to leave already?
Can't you just stay
one more night?
I would love to, Carlsbad,
but I got to go.
Aw...
He's going to Nairobi to help
out with the Ebola situation.
- Yeah.
- Oh.
Nairobi?
Yeah. I goes where I's needed.
Ricky! Ricky!
Those guys.
Well...
Oh, man.
- Okay, bye, Ricky.
- One of a kind.
- I'll see you inside.
- I'll see you in a minute.
I'm going to help with the baby.
Okay.
That was amazing. Incredible.
You are a legend.
That was world class, Rod.
It's Ricky.
- Yeah...
- Right.
Well, here's your dough.
Uh, we put some extra in there
just 'cause you knocked
it out of the park, man.
- Yes you did.
- Yeah.
Where did you learn
to circumcise?
Oh, had a job peeling shrimp
at Beefsteak Charlie's.
Okay.
Oh, you blowing up, huh?
Are you going to
get that, or...?
No. That's just a crazy fan.
Well, now you got
three crazy fans.
That's right.
You guys take care.
- You too!
- Yeah, you too.
- We'll be fine. You take care.
- Yeah, please.
If you're ever in
Atlantic City...
- Possibly.
- We'll let you know.
We'll definitely let you know.
He's good to go.
- Thanks, Rod.
- Thank you.
It's Ricky.
- Whew!
- Yeah!
- I'm hungry, man.
- Let's feed you.
I can't believe it worked!
I can't believe it
actually fucking worked.
As much of a nut
job as Rod is...
- Uh, it's Ricky.
- Oh, sorry, Ricky.
But he came through. He
actually came through.
So that's it, though, right?
- Yep.
- No more Ricky Stanicky.
No, we are never mentioning
his name ever again.
It was fun while it
lasted. Right? Okay.
But it's time to get off that
roller coaster once and for all.
Yep. Ride's over, folks!
Please exit to your left!
Please check for
your belongings!
You gotta be this tall
to ride this ride.
Wes, you always do
one too many, man.
Fuck you. Is that one too many?
- Oh, it is. That is too many.
- Guys, guys, guys. Guys.
For the very last
time, a toast...
To Ricky Stanicky.
To Ricky Stanicky!
Best friend we never had.
- You got some on your arm.
- Hoo!
I mean, it's my
newborn son, you know,
it's like this bonding thing.
If anybody else
had pissed on me,
I'd be totally grossed out.
What about if it was Susan?
Eew!
Hey, guys, grab a cup of
coffee and get in here.
Yes!
Yesterday was a real kick.
It was nice spending
time with you guys
outside the boiler room.
- Mm-hm.
- It is.
Who doesn't love a
good bris, right?
Right! We should
do it all the time.
- Have a bris?
- Hang out. We should hang...
By the way, your wife,
Miriam, she's amazing.
- Just fantastic.
- A lovely, lovely woman.
Thanks. She liked you guys too.
And she was really taken
with your friend Stanicky.
He's got brass balls
on him, that guy.
She loved how in my face he was.
Really?
Yeah, he'll give it
to you, man, that guy.
- That's Ricky.
- Yeah. He'll...
- Just... he's a character.
- He is a character.
- A powerful creature, man.
- He sure is.
That's why I hired him.
- Mm-hm.
- Awesome.
What the fuck did you just say?
What the fuck did you just say?
I just said, "Awesome."
That's awesome.
You just said...
What did you say? Just
say it one more time?
Ricky gave me his number and
when I got home, I called him.
I got him right before
he got on the plane too.
He came over to my place.
We were up till 4 a.m.
banging out a deal.
The buff guy?
The guy who wore the safari
outfit to my son's bris
and circumcised him
with a cigar cutter?
- You banged out a deal?
- Yes.
I hired Ricky Stanicky.
Wow! Wow!
But do you think... like,
he has the experience
- to be working here?
- Yeah, does he, ya think?
Nah, whatever he
lacks in experience,
he more than makes up for
with piss and vinegar.
I loved his take on
the World River deal.
- But that's...
- Not his take, really.
Yeah, that's just what
he read in the news.
Uh-huh.
You can stop
playing games, guys.
I know you've been
recruiting him.
You don't think I noticed
that JT expensed three rounds
of golf at Carnegie Abbey
in the last couple of months?
That was two rounds, I think...
B-because we were... we were...
- We were recruiting him.
- Recruiting him.
And we decided...
- Not... not good.
- Not Summerhayes material.
Yeah, he just doesn't...
I don't think he's
right for this place.
Hey! Speak of the devil.
Okay.
- Oh, Philip.
- Yeah?
I was hoping to see something
in a mahogany or a birch.
I believe this is Carolina
pine. That's a shit wood.
Okay. Uh... shit wood...
Philip, can we have a sec?
Yes. Please.
Oh, and for these walls,
I'd love to see something
in more of a ham color.
Right.
What the fuck do you
think you're doing here?
This is unbelievable.
How cool is this, right?
And I didn't even have to
fill out an application!
Application?! This
isn't Little Caesar's.
There's no way for you to act
your way through this, okay?
There's no script for
you to follow here.
Okay, you guys can help me out.
Just like I helped you out
in the bris thing, right?
- That's what friends are for.
- Friends? We're not friends!
The deal was you come to
the gig, then you leave.
You got paid.
- Now go!
- Go!
Come on. What was
I supposed to do?
Your boss, Summer
squash, hits me up
- and he's like, "Hey, man."
- 'Summerhayes'?
Yes, that guy.
Offers me 250 large
right out of the blue.
- What?!
- $250,000?
Yeah, but that's
for the whole year.
That's more than we make.
Oh, my God!
Well, I did work as a hostage
negotiator in Somalia.
So maybe I bring a certain
amount of life experience
to the table.
I mean, come on, guys,
didn't you read the bible?
- We wrote the fucking bible!
- We did that.
Rod, I need you to listen
to me very, very carefully.
It's 'Ricky'.
Rod! Listen to me, okay?
There's no way that this
ends well. All right?
You don't even know
what we do here.
It's like business stuff.
You guys are like...
like bookies, right?
We're not bookies.
Well, when you boil it down
a little bit, there is...
It's way more complex
than that, okay?
Dean, Erin's in your office.
She says it's urgent.
Hey.
They hired me!
- Who?
- MFMBC!
They want me to produce the
'Hero of the Week' segment.
- MFMBC?
- Yes!
Are you kidding me? What?!
Oh, my gosh! Oh.
- Oh, I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.
Didn't I tell you you were
going to get your big break?
- You did, you did.
- You got your big break.
You did. I pushed them
the Ricky Stanicky story
and they loved it.
The Ricky what?
The 'Hero of the Week' segment.
I sent them a proposal
about the work Ricky does
in Africa, in South America
and how he works with Bono,
and helped clean
up the oil spill
in the Chesapeake Bay, and
they want me to produce it!
- Oh!
- "Oh"?
What's wrong with your face?
This is my happy face.
I'm so... I'm happy.
I'm ha... I'm happy.
Great. Because we got to
get him back here now.
They want me to
run it this week.
Right.
I don't know if that's
going to be... possible.
I don't... There's
just a lot of, uh...
- More of a canned ham.
- A lot of moving...
- Very close to spam.
- Ricky?
Ricky!
Ricky!
Man of the Year?
Wow! That's so cool!
It's not man of the year.
It's hero of the week.
And it's not wow. It's
a fucking shit show.
And on top of that,
the girls are going
bowling with him tonight.
- Do we have to go?
- Of course we have to go.
We're the dip shit's
best friends, remember?
Plus we can't let that
fucker out of our sight.
There's no telling
what he'll say.
You know, on the bright side,
it is pretty remarkable that,
you know, we invented a man
who can win an award like this.
Hey, you think he'll thank us?
Are you fucking
serious right now?
Wes! You are smoking
way too much weed
if you don't understand
how serious this is, okay?
It's not just about us anymore.
This could destroy
Erin's career. Wake up!
I don't have a choice.
- I got to tell her the truth.
- No fucking way!
- I got to.
- Dean, no. Dude!
If you tell Erin,
she'll tell Susan. Okay?
Then what do you think
is going to happen?
Not only did I miss
the birth of my son,
but I let some porno Peter
Frampton impersonator
snip his dick with
a cigar cutter.
No!
Hey, guys.
Hey, Karnowski.
How was the Rebillet show?
It was great, you piece of
shit. Thanks for the tickets.
Thank you!
Shitbag!
He doesn't deserve
that. Karnowsk!
Karnowski!
You'll never pick it up.
I like your form.
I mean, look at this guy.
Not a care in the world.
If he mentions his
salary one more time,
I'm going to hit him
in the fucking head.
Well, maybe if you
gave him more money
than he's being
paid, he'd leave.
He's getting paid $250,000, Wes.
Yeah, but that's
for the whole year.
I'll just run to my bank, then.
We got to figure out a way to
get rid of him or we're done.
Look, maybe you're worried
about nothing, right?
She only has a couple
of days to dig up dirt.
If she doesn't dig up
dirt, that's worse.
Eventually someone's going
to find out the truth.
And then Erin would just
be one of those journalists
that makes up fake stories.
Yeah, like Mario Lopez.
Oh.
Well, look who's hitting it off.
I thought she was
with Gary Polisner.
Apparently not.
Hey, look, none of my business,
but you should think
about chopping that off.
What? A haircut?
No, I don't know, I
mean, I'd be afraid to.
Why? With a face like yours,
you should have a pixie.
- Really?
- Yes! Look at this.
Okay...
Maybe not.
Down to the shoulders,
maybe mid back.
Yeah, I mean, yeah...
Honestly, I've kind of been
wanting to cut it for a while,
but I just feel like this
is like my thing now,
and everyone says
that they love it.
They're just being nice.
What, really?
Oh, yeah. Trust me.
But why would they lie to me?
I don't know. People
are weird, right?
Maybe it's hard for
them to tell you
you look like a freaking loon.
Hey, Carly, whoa.
Look, I love your
hair. All right?
What I was trying to say was,
if you want to cut
it, you should.
You shouldn't care about
what anybody else thinks.
Look at you.
You're smart, you're sweet.
You got that cute
little muskrat face.
But all anybody can
ever see is your insane
ly beautiful hair.
Which is like the tenth best
thing you got going for you.
Agh! Ricky! Ricky!
Oh, what's happening? Ricky,
Ricky, what's happening?
What's happen...? Ow!
Hey! Stop fucking bowling!
What just happened?
Oh, Carly, that was terrible.
Moron! He almost
took her head off.
That's it. He's done.
I'll gladly pay 250,
300, whatever it costs.
I'll get a loan, sell a
kidney. Whatever it takes.
He's out of here!
Wait a minute.
What if he didn't have a job
that paid him 250 grand a year?
Like, if he got fired.
Let's face facts.
We need this merger
with World River,
and they seem to be able
to take it or leave it.
Why? Well, I'll tell you why.
Those folks are
from San Francisco
and we're an old-money
New England company.
They think we're dinosaurs.
They're looking for new,
they're looking for progressive.
So, come on. Let's
hear some ideas.
Dean, you're point on this.
Why don't you get us started?
Actually, I was
thinking that Ricky
should take point on this today.
He's our newest employee
and he's an 'eco-hero'.
I like that idea.
Ricky, what do you got?
Well, thank you for the
vote of confidence, Dean.
You should run the
meeting, for sure.
I am just not quite up to speed.
Well, that makes sense.
But Ricky's got something
big worked out here.
What'd you call it? Um...
game changer, right?
Game changer. Got to love
that. Ricky, what do you got?
I, um...
I, er...
Rick, I have a
lunch in 23 minutes.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um...
My area of expertize is in
non-profit humanitarian work.
In short, I'm a world hugger.
So, you know, why don't we
bring my exciting background
to the boring-ass world
of investment products?
I mean, you know,
ladies and gentlemen,
does for-profit have
to be for profit?
Well, that's the general idea.
Correct!
Ten points to the gentleman
in the conservative grey suit.
Er, could you please elaborate?
What I was saying
was, what if we took
all the money we made
and gave it away to
poor people and shit?
I'm not sure I understand that.
- And shit.
- I know I don't.
Well, think about it.
If we became, um, like the
Paul-Newman-salad-dressing
of banks,
the whole world would like us.
That is the stupidest
idea I've ever heard.
Well, now, wait a minute.
Read between the
lines, Billings.
This is exactly what
I've been talking about.
Stanicky's saying we
got to shake things up.
Try something different.
No, that's not what he's
saying. He's saying...
What about that Tom's company?
Giving away a free pair of
shoes for every pair sold.
I bet that sounded like
a stupid idea at first.
And what are they clearing?
170 million in
revenue last year.
170 million. That's impressive.
Now, obviously, we can't
give away all our money,
but we could funnel some of it
into philanthropic ventures.
And there have got
to be tax incentives.
- Yeah! Tax shit.
- Yeah.
We could call it, um...
Feel-Good Investing.
We'll show people we're
a company that cares.
Feel-Good Investing. I like
that. Great work, Rick.
Thanks, Ted.
What did you say, Ricky?
Oh... nothing.
I was just saying
"fuck you" to that guy.
Yeah, fuck you, Billings!
We're just kidding.
But fuck you, Billings.
Here's what we're going to do.
The World River folks are
flying in Wednesday afternoon.
Wednesday? What? Why Wednesday?
Because Wednesday night
we're going to have a little
summit over at my club
and watch Ricky's 'Hero
of the Week' segment.
Clubs ahoy!
Right.
Now, I want you to bring your
families and your A-games.
Wednesday, we're going to
show these people who we are.
We're modern, we're fun,
we're socially conscious,
and we're American heroes.
- What is happening right now?
- I don't know.
I feel like Jason Bateman
in every episode of 'Ozark'.
Hey, boss-man? Er, got a minute?
Sure!
Dean! JT! What it do?
What the...? What
are you doing here?
Ricky hired me.
- To do what?
- I don't know.
Help him out with
stuff, I guess.
Yes, I think young Wesley
shows great promise
as my attaché.
- Who's your attaché, Dean?
- I don't have an attaché.
I'm not a foreign diplomat.
Listen, you and me
need to have a chat.
Okay, but before we do, I
want to show you something.
First, thank you
for having faith
and believing in me today.
I never would've come up with
those ideas in the meeting
if you hadn't thrown
me into the fire.
Happy to do it, man.
I think I figured out
what the problem is.
What problem?
The whole 'not getting the
merger' thingy problem.
You went to one staff meeting
and you've got the whole
company figured out?
So I filmed this on my phone in
the staff meeting this morning
and my attaché put
it on the computer.
So, check it out.
- San Francisco and we...
- See?
- old-money New England...
- You see?
- They're looking for...
- See what?
The guy's a
world-class air-dicker.
An air what-er? What
are you talking about?
Keep watching.
Every time he tries
to make a point,
it's like he puts an
invisible penis in his mouth.
Remember when Obama
used to power knuckle
to try to make that point?
Well, Summerhayes
does the same thing,
but when he does it, it's like
he's smoking invisible dongs.
Oh, my God, he is an air-dicker.
There's a time and
a place for it,
but it's really hard
to get away with it
in a business setting.
Yo, let's make a
TikTok out of this!
What do you guys think?
Should I tell him?
Tell him what?
That he's a
world-class air-dicker.
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, you should.
How could you work
for him, dude?
We don't need you exploring
career opportunities
when he's trying
to ruin our lives.
First of all, he's
not ruining my life.
He hired me 'cause he
actually gives a shit.
If I didn't get off
my ass and get a job,
Keith was going to dump me.
By the way, I noticed that
my so-called real friends
never offered me a job.
Are you fucking shitting me?!
You two!
In here, now!
Come in, sit down.
Show them what you showed me.
I already did, Ted.
You knew about this and
you never said anything?
Well, we just thought it was...
It's just a mannerism. It's
really not that big of a deal.
Especially in this day and age.
I know it's not a big deal!
Two of my sons are
gay, for Christ's sake!
And the third one's
just... working it out.
But I can't go into
meetings like this.
No wonder they're not
interested in the merger.
They're so flippin' distracted,
they haven't heard
a word I've said.
We don't know that you've been
doing this everywhere. I...
As far as we know, you just
did it in today's meeting.
I'd never seen it before.
Really?
I've got the conference link.
This merger will allow us
to further enhance our
capital efficiencies.
- Look at you.
- Oh, God...
Air-dicking left and right.
There are companies out
there who want to get bigger.
There are companies out there
who want to get smaller.
You just air-dicked four
times in ten seconds.
Oh, dear God, it's true.
On the other hand, to
support everything we do...
Oh, God! Now it looks like
I'm cupping the balls.
with knowledge and planning.
Oh!
Hey, you're double-dongin' it.
is the company that can do both.
Oh, God. Get it... Turn it off.
Some people say...
Okay, from this point forward.
Stanicky is in
charge of the merger.
What? Ted, come on.
I've been running point
on this for nine months.
Yeah, and look where
it's gotten us.
He's been here one day and...
- Watch the air-dicking, Ted.
- Jesus...!
Here's the bottom line.
Stanicky gives it
to me straight,
whether the news is good or bad.
He's in charge.
End of discussion.
Oh, Jesus. Okay, just
make it go away. Just...
- Yep.
- Go to black.
- Oh, er...
- Just go to black.
Yeah, I'm pressing
it but it's not...
- Give it to me.
- Yeah, try...
I don't know how
to work this thing.
- No, I know.
- Is there an IT guy?
- That's me.
- Argh, fuck!
Oh, Dean...
Despite what Ted
said back there,
about me being in charge,
I don't pretend to know more
about this company than you.
Well, I pretend to
know more than you,
but you are clearly
more informed in
company matters than me
and right now I
need your expertize.
What?
I don't want to
forget this. Okay...
How big of a raise
should I be asking for?
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
You're quitting! Today!
- What are you talking about?
- Show's over, Rod.
It's Ricky.
It's not Ricky, okay? Get
it through your head, man.
Ricky Stanicky isn't real.
Yes, he is. Here.
Richard Barbara Stanicky?
That's my grandmother's name.
Where the fuck did you get this?
Officially changed my name.
Paid to expedite it online.
They overnighted it.
Oh, my God.
Come on, Dean. See
this from my side.
This is the role I was born
to play and I'm nailing it.
No, you were hired
under false pretences.
You lied to them.
No, as I recall, Dean,
you lied to them.
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
You got me there.
But you know what?
This is different.
You're putting people's
careers at risk.
Careers?
I've been here two
days and I'm your boss.
I'm talking about Erin's career!
You can fool Summerhayes
with this righteous shit.
But I know who you really are.
You're Rock Hard Rod! The drunk.
Yeah.
I was a drunk.
Nobody respected me. My job
sucked. I had no friends.
But now I have all those things.
And I'm sober. All right?
And if I leave here,
it all goes away.
My whole life, all I've
ever been is a shit baby.
And now I get to be somebody
people actually like.
Don't take that away
from me, man. Please.
Look, this has to end.
What the fuck are you
doing? Stop! Stop! Hey, hey!
Argh! Hey, okay!
If I go back, they'll kill me.
If I go back, they'll kill me.
What?!
If I go back to Atlantic
City, they'll kill me.
- Who?
- The Sasquatch
and his Joe Pesce
buddy from the casino.
I told you they were crazy fans.
They're crazy. They're not fans.
Why? What did you do?
I don't know.
I used to drink and black
out, it could be anything.
One day I woke up after
a five-day bender,
I was a manager of an Arby's.
Plus, I owe a lot of bad
people a lot of money.
You were right, man.
It's my fault.
It's... it's my fault.
Wow.
I had everything.
I had good friends.
I had a great job.
The most kind-hearted,
beautiful person in the
whole world loved me.
Erin's the best thing
that ever happened to me.
I'm going to lose it all.

I'll never understand why you
don't just tell her the truth.
I think it's a little
late for that, Wes.
No, it's not.
That was Steve
Smith in Washington.
And tomorrow night at 7 p.m.
we present our Hero of the Week.
Seconds on steak
fries? Uh, yeah!
Visit your local Red Robin
to try our new
bottomless steak fries.
I swear to God, man,
Stanicky's like one of
those trick birthday candles
no matter how hard I
try to blow him out,
he just keeps coming back.
Dean, I love you like a brother,
but you got one major flaw.
Hmm?
You lie too much.
I lie too much?
What the...?
You lie just as much as me.
Only 'cause you make me.
I've been trying to tell
the truth on this one
from the beginning,
but you said no.
Because I was
looking out for JT.
I didn't want JT
to get in trouble.
Dude, this has
nothing to do with JT.
This has everything
to do with you.
Do you realize that Rod had a
fake life and he made it real?
You had a real life
and you made it fake.
Fuck this, man. I
don't need this shit.
You're not making
anything better.
Yo, I know you ain't
fall in no ditch.
What?
I know you didn't fall in a
ditch, that one Halloween.
When you broke your arm.
After we egged that house,
and we all split in
different directions,
I went back to your place
to see if you was there,
and you were.
And I heard him.
I heard what he did to you.
That was an accident.
He was drunk.
See, there you go
again. You're lying.
Dude, I understand you grew
up in a fucked-up house
and you had a fucked-up father,
and that's why you slept
over at me and JT's house,
and that's probably
why you started a lie.
To protect yourself.
But you're not that boy anymore,
and you're letting
this shitty stuff
turn you into a shitty
person, and that's not you.
If you just tell Erin the truth,
she won't hurt you.

Hey. Where were you?
I was worried about you.
I tried to call you.
Listen, Erin
you can't let them
run your story.
Yeah, well, it's a
little too late for that.
No, you don't understand.
Is there a way that you can
postpone it or pre-empt it?
Is that what they say in
your business? 'Pre-empt'?
'Cause there's a lot of things
that you need to
know about Ricky.
You mean Rock Hard Rod?
Don't look so surprised, Dean.
I'm a good reporter, you
said so yourself, remember?
Yeah, I know you are.
I figured it out at the bris.
Nairobi?
You said he had to fly
back to help fight Ebola,
but there hasn't
been an Ebola case
anywhere in the last four years
and definitely never in Nairobi.
They actually have
a vaccine now.
That's good.
Ricky showed me your bible.
It's pathetic.
You guys lied so you could
go to the Little
League World Series,
the Lebowski Fest,
a tiny train museum.
Wes likes trains.
You went to Dollywood, twice!
Why didn't you take me with
you? I love Dolly Parton.
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.
What bothers me
more than the lies
is why you told them
in the first place.
You were running from me.
From us.
No. No, that's not true.
Well, it doesn't
matter anymore, Dean.
It's too late.
I just want this day to be over.
Me too.
What if he chickened out? What
if he's going to bail on us?
Where is Dean?
He's, uh, on his...
He'll be here any minute.
And where is Ricky?
The World River execs
want to meet him.
Also on his way. His
attaché is here, so...
Hi.
So, where were we?
Hey!
Where the hell have you been?
The show starts
in three minutes.
Summerhayes wants
Ricky to introduce it.
- Where is this guy?
- There's no show.
What?
Ricky was never going
to be Hero of the Week.
Erin knew all along.
Knew what?
That Ricky was a fake. She
figured it out at the bris.
So she was lying to us?
Well, that's pretty fuckin' low.
Are you an idiot?
What are we going
to tell Summerhayes?
The truth.
Dean, come on.
Don't do that. Dean!
Good evening, everyone.
Thank you all for
coming out. Thank you.
Thank you.
I see a lot of old
friends out here tonight,
and a lot of new friends.
And I see two great companies
that can
can, uh, do wonderful things.
I was hoping that the man
of the hour, Ricky Stanicky,
would be here to introduce
this MFMBC Heroes segment.
- Ted, can I say something?
- Yes, absolutely. Yes, please.
Dean Stanton,
our Vice President of
Investor Relations.
Dean.
Um...
Unfortunately, MFMBC has decided
not to profile Ricky
Stanicky as a hero.
Ha...
The reason being
that Ricky Stanicky's
not a hero.
He's not even a real person.
I made him up.
Motherfucker!
I lied to all of you.
And I have no excuses.
I'm sorry, Ted.
You don't deserve this.
I'd also like to
apologize to everyone
who came out here
from San Francisco.
Summerhayes Financial
is an excellent company.
Please don't let
my actions destroy
what could be a
great partnership.
What the fuck did he just say?
I don't know what to do.
I told you...
Where is that pumpkin-headed
piece of shit?
I don't get it.
If the show wasn't for real,
then why'd the
news crew come in?
- What news crew?
- Yesterday.
While you were at lunch,
this crew came in and
interviewed Ricky.
I helped set the whole thing up.
Dean, don't worry about
cleaning out your office.
We'll box it up for ya,
and then burn it.
I'm standing outside the offices
of Summerhayes Financial,
an esteemed institution
in downtown Providence,
Rhode Island.
And that is Richard
Barbara Stanicky.
Think of us as the bookies
and you're the gambler.
We're the nice bookies, not the
throw-you-off-the bridge type.
After several years
helping the less...
Why the hell is this still on?!
charity, he's now the newest
and one of the most
highly paid executives
at Summerhayes Financial.
Where's the AV guy?
- Oh, that's me.
- I thought you were the IT guy.
I'm both.
But there's something
you should know
about this highly
successful executive.
He's a complete fraud.
I'm Ted Summerhayes...
That's right.
Ricky Stanicky is
actually Rodney Rimestead,
a pornographic
rock'n'roll impersonator
from Atlantic City, New Jersey,
who goes by the name
of Rock Hard Rod.
We caught up with Mr. Rimestead
to find out how he came to be
the businessman
'Ricky Stanicky'.
I was hanging around a
casino bar in Atlantic City.
No money, no
friends, no respect.
I was an alcoholic.
I am... I am an alcoholic.
And I was doing whatever
I could to get by.
♪ Cum a, cum a, cum a
Come in my sock again ♪
♪ It's filled with loads ♪
Oh, God.
♪ It's filled with loads... ♪
And that night, I met Dean
Stanton and his friends.
They bought me food, drink.
They asked me who I was,
they really seemed to care.
And as Rod would
discover, they did care.
Dean!
You got to see this!
Within days, Dean
Stanton and his friends
would reach out again.
I couldn't believe they called.
These are people I met only once
and only for a few minutes,
and here they were offering me
the opportunity of a lifetime.
And what was that opportunity?
Simply to become
'Ricky Stanicky'.
They said, "You are no
longer Rod Rimestead",
"the loser."
"From here on out, you're
Ricky Stanicky, the winner."
That was the first time
somebody had ever
believed in me.
After relocating Rod,
now Ricky, to Providence,
Dean Stanton and friends set
about creating a new identity
for the man who'd once
MC'ed an X-rated dog show.
We caution you
this next video may be
disturbing to some viewers.
♪ It's a beautiful night
♪ All the stars
Shining bright... ♪
Oh, my God!
They gave me a book. They
called it their bible.
It was like a blueprint for
how to live as Ricky Stanicky.
How to live a good life.
How to learn from your errors.
I saw what I could have been.
What I'd missed.
And the more and more
I read their bible,
the more I realized
this doesn't have
to be just a dream.
And so 'Ricky' stopped drinking
and started respecting himself.
Soon he had a job here
at Summerhayes Financial.
Dean introduced me
to Ted Summerhayes.
He's one of those rich guys
who's gotta whip out his
big swinging super-yacht
- to show you how rich he is.
- Oh, God...
But, on the other hand, the
guy's got a heart of gold.
We started Feel-Good Investing.
And then, through Dean, I
met more and more friends.
I met a beautiful girl,
with a beautiful soul.
Aw.
And I had a life.
I became 'Ricky Stanicky'.
And somewhere in the
middle of it all,
the line between the mythical
and the real had blurred.
And that's how, improbably, a
drunken Atlantic City reject
found himself blessed with a
new life in the Ocean State.
Hero? Me? No. No.
If there's a hero to this story,
it's the men who saved my life.
Dean Stanton, JT Levine
and Wes... something.
A story that started
out fraudulently,
somehow, miraculously,
became a tale of redemption,
rebirth and love.
Because he believed
that anybody at any time
can become the person
they want to be,
we choose Ricky Stanicky
as our Hero of the Week.
Ricky! Ricky! Ricky!
♪ If you're going to
San Francisco... ♪
Well
you came out of this smelling
like a rose, didn't ya?
How do you think
it makes me look?
Are you kidding me?!
Such a wonderful and
inspirational story, Ted.
Great job Ted,
and you too, Dean.
Oh, I... I didn't do it.
Summerhayes. I like the people
you surround yourself with.
I mean, the concept
of second chances
and feeling good
about your investments
that's something we're
trying to achieve.
Well, that's... what we do.
Truth is, it was Ted who
saw the potential in Ricky.
It was also his idea
to start partnering
with more charitable
organizations.
I just saw the tax incentives.
You're a humble son
of a bitch, aren't ya?
Ah...
So, do we have a deal?
I don't know.
Dean, what do you think?
We have a deal.
- Absolutely, we have a deal.
- Yeah, we have a deal.
- Great.
- Wonderful.
You let your made-up friend
circumcise our child?
Honey, he worked at
Beefsteak Charlie's.
Beefsteak...

for the next six months.
Okay. Okay.
Very reasonable.
That's more than fair.
It's going to be
great. Thank you.
- Perfect.
- Thank you.
I don't understand.
How did this happen?
Well...
When I found out what
you did, I was pissed.
I told you I sold the story to
MFMBC just to fuck with you.
But when Ricky was hired
at Summerhayes, I thought,
wait a minute, maybe there
actually is a story here.
So I pitched it to my
producer at Channel 6.
They told their friend at MFMBC
and they gave me
the green light.
All those lies, Erin...
Can you ever forgive me?
It's definitely not
going to be easy.
But
this helps.
I had everything.
I had good friends.
I had a great job.
The most kind-hearted,
beautiful person in the
whole world loved me.
Erin's the best thing
that ever happened to me.
Ricky sent it to me today.
Here we go, here we
go, here we go...
Who's that?
Ricky! Look out!
Did that go how you
thought it would, wanker?!
Here, Rimestead! You've
officially been served.
What the...?
What's this?
This is a cease-and-desist
order from Billy Idol.
Yeah?
If you disgrace any of his songs
with your disgusting
lyrics ever again,
we'll see you in court.
Huh?
Yeah.
So Billy Idol saw my act?
Fuck off!
