Since its creation in 1934,
Jean Vigo's ''L'Atalante''
has undergone numerous mutilations
and tentative restorations.
This version of the film
aims to be as faithful
as possible to the original.
Come on! Hurry up!
ln the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost. Amen.
Don't worry, Ma.
She's married a fine man.
She'll be back one day!
She's never been away before!
A pity there's no wedding banquet!
Oh, you!
-Shall we go to the barge?
-We don't even know him!
Where's the bride?
-What'd you say?
-What?
They're already late!
With the boat company!
Stay in line! Two by two!
Couldn't she marry a local guy?
She always has to be different!
She doesn't like the village.
They've already reached the village!
Understand?
Yeah...
What do ya do when she arrives?
l go to her and say...
What?
''Welcome aboard the Atalante!''
Got the flowers?
They're in the bucket.
Wrap them in paper
or they'll wet her dress!
Here they are!
You're too much!
Give me that!
And now my cap!
l'll buy more flowers!
ln the middle of nowhere?
They're coming!
We've had it!
Where ya going?
Never mind!
Never mind! Come on!
l won't scold ya!
Never mind!
l'll pick some!
The Lord's deserted us!
Hurry up!
Don't fall in the water!
Wrap 'em in paper!
Welcome aboard the ''Atalante!''
Some paper!
-Do we leave now?
-Yes!
l'll start the motor.
Hey, boss-lady!
Juliette!
There's your daughter!
Goodbye!
Farewell!
We'll wake the boss-lady with music!
Boss-lady!
Landing!
Get the ropes! We're tying up!
Jules! Come see
what your cats did on our bed!
Come on!
Cats are no dirtier than you
and not as dumb!
Not as dumb!
There!
Ya had your kittens!
That's why ya hid!
Yes, on our bed!
They're not mine!
Outside!
Take 'em or l'll drown 'em.
You'd drown your own kid!
Come on!
Don't stay with these nasty folks!
He has 3 more like her!
-Where are the sheets?
-ln the cupboard.
You do the laundry once a year?
Not always.
Things are gonna change!
Wait till tomorrow!
Why?
Not today!
No!
You have time!
-Wait!
-OK, l'll help.
We'll do some cooking.
l want your dirty laundry.
Dirty laundry?
She had her kittens!
-What for?
-She's gonna do the washing.
She wants to do my laundry?
Jules won't give me his laundry.
He won't?
No, he won't.
l don't need you.
l don't need her to wash my feet.
Don't be silly!
Gimme that!
Only to please her!
l'd even go shopping...
to please her!
There's the ironmonger!
l got a record.
A record?
As you can see.
l don't have a phonograph.
Jules and his old pal!
He always buys bits of springs,
old stuff and machines.
''We're on the barge to get work done!''
''Not sailing along just to have fun!''
You closed your eyes?
Closed my eyes? Sure!
What of it?
Don't you know you can see...
the one you love in the water?
-What?
-lt's true!
When l was little,
l saw those things.
Last year l saw you
and recognized you when...
you first came to the house.
Really?
l saw nothing!
Wait!
Stop!
That's enough!
You're crazy!
-l can't see you!
-Don't!
l don't see you!
l see you!
l see you!
Carry your bag!
ls that all you can do?
l'll show you some wrestling!
Like Raoul the Butcher!
A stranglehold!
On the ground!
Then an arm pin!
A bridge!
Then butt with the head!
A return flip!
Then both shoulders!
What do you think?
They ran off!
You're silly!
l wanted to see you!
So look at me!
ln the water!
You laugh but it's true.
You'll see when you do it seriously.
Take this. lt's warm.
Jean! Coming down?
Jean, it's 7 AM!
Going to stop?
lt's raining.
That's not my fault!
She's right.
She needs more than a quilt!
Hit the sack, boss!
Hard a-starboard!
Hard a-port!
lt's like this every night.
Are you bored?
Don't worry,
you'll see the world!
River banks...
Will we get there soon?
Where?
l don't know.
Just somewhere!
A city. A big city!
Does it take long
to unload in the city?
''Paris calling!''
Jean! lt's Paris!
-What?
-Paris!
-Surprised?
-ls it far?
Near or far,
it always sounds the same.
How many days
will it take to get there?
Soon enough
for the docks at La Villette!
Here! Get dressed!
''Paris calling with the latest news!''
''For the sales on Boulevard Haussmann...''
''the shop windows are full...''
More talk!
Leave Paris on!
Be careful! You'll break it!
Be careful yourself!
There!
''Purple is all the rage, with lam√©,''
''velvet and satin for the evening.''
'' Berets are worn''
''with the left side turned up.''
Jules! The anchor!
Prepare to land!
Light the lights!
l'll go see the boss-lady!
You almost rammed us!
We couldn't see a thing!
Be careful!
The boss-lady!
Where is she?
Why didn't you answer?
You scared me!
-What's wrong?
-Nothing!
-Nothing?
-Leave us alone!
-Alone?
-Get to work!
He and his Juliette

Work!
Does she grease the engine?
Always kissin'
or arguin' all day!

My babies!
Cute things!
Those old cows!
-ls he angry?
-No.
Where is he?
He won't leave.
Don't fret!
Your Jules will show up.
You could be on time!
Scat, Cutie, you're not welcome.
Don't sulk!
l'm not.
Looks like the fog's lifting.
Let's make up for lost time.
Finish eating, Jules.
Come on, kid!
-Who? Me?
-Yes, you!
What're you doing?
Using the sewing machine.
Using a sewing machine?
Sewing machine?
You never saw a sewing machine before?
A sewing machine? Me?
Move over...
You know all the trades!
l know a lot.
Look at these hands.
You've no idea what they've done!
Even one night in Shanghai, going up...
Don't be foolish!
Don't go too far!
l'm not mean,
unless you get my dander up.
That's enough!
lf you're so good,
put this skirt on.
Skirt?
Be my mannequin so l can flare it.
Flare it?
Flares suit me fine!
How do ya wear this?
Stand still.
l can't do it.
How do ya wear this?
You can't button it?
Pull in your stomach!
You have a narrow waist!
Don't tickle me!
Stand up
and put that on straight!
Stand still or l'll stick you!
Think you're with the Negroes?
With the Negroes?
l know more than Negroes!
Yokohama, Melbourne,
Shanghai, Papeete...
San Francisco! 1903!
Dorothy!
Singapore! San Sebastian!
Give me my skirt!
You'll tear it!
Now go! Take your laundry.
Let me get my breath!

Will you leave or not?
No, no, no and no again!
Papa Jules!

Get on deck!
The boss says get a move on!
The boss? Who's he?
Who's the boss?

That's a tattoo.

That keeps me warm.
Keeps me warm!

You have nice hair.
So do you, Papa Jules.
Not as nice as yours.

You're too kind.

You're crazy!
This place isn't yours!
Not mine?
Do you think it's yours?
There!
You cut your hair?
''Dog Barber''
They forgot one!
Don't be angry.

with that old weirdo.
You always wanted to see Paris.

7 years of bad luck!
They don't need you here.
Let's go out!
Put on a collar?

Moth balls!
From your wedding suit!

Boss!
He scared me!
What's wrong? A fire?
l'm going for a consultation.
-Are you sick?
-No, but l'm going anyway.
Look! l'm ready!
We have to wait for Jules.
What? He's coming with us?
He's gone for a consultation.
A consultation?
At the doctor's.
He's sick. He took the kid.

So we're not going out.
We'll go out but later!
We're simply not going out.
Getting undressed?
What else?
Since l'm staying here...
Just go on hoping for Jules!
And the broken necklace?
Don't worry.
Your cards are good.
The cards are good?
Give me your hand.

-The cards are in my favor?
-They are.
You're so sensual!
You must've had plenty!

The boss-lady in her slip!
Wake up, kid!
Papa Jules is drunk again.
Each time we're in a town,

The sooner we go,
the better off we'll be.
Since we're awake,
we'll leave now.
Help me cast off!
Get your pants on, kid.
-Mad at me?
-No. Why?
We finally got to Paris
and Jules acted up.
That's nothing new.
When we come back,
l promise we'll have fun.

You're just saying that.
You don't believe me?
We won't wait till Corbeil...

We're as good as there!
''The poultry is inside''

Another hand...

We're leaving.
We were to stay 2 days!

Last night?
What's past is past!
What'd l do wrong today?

lt's not you!
Then who?
The boss-lady's gone.
Shh! The kid might hear you.
He doesn't need to know.
Where'd she go?
l don't care.

She'll be back in a minute or so...
or an hour or tomorrow.
Even in 5 minutes
l wouldn't want her back!
Let me rest!
You said 2 days at the dock!
2 days and then we'll look for her.
What good would that do, idiot?
Who gives orders here?
Get on deck!
We'll sail for Corbeil at once!
A 3rd class to Corbeil.
Fontainebleau!
My train's leaving!
A 3rd class to Corbeil...
Thief!

You're white!
Cheating!
Then let's play fair!
Go ahead, boss.
You're black.
Just when l was gonna win!
That's too bad.
Now we can't play anymore.
He's completely crazy.
lf the machine worked,
it'd get his mind off things.
Yesterday l thought l had it.
l'll have to work on it more.
Laugh!
There's harder things than...
makin' a record play with your finger.
And electricity!
Do ya know what that is?
And the wireless!
Do ya know how that works?
So don't argue!
l know!
You put that spring here?
lt don't belong!
lt works!
lt works!
Get the boss!
lt works real good!
The boss jumped in the river!
Boss jumped in the river!
The boss jumped in?
He jumped in?
Where?
Ya sure
ya saw him jump in?
He can't drown!
He knows how to swim!
You really scared us!
Go change!
Would you like to go fishing?

Aren't ya goin' fishing?
Not going fishing?
Get his jacket!
You're going fishing!
We'll play the phonograph!
Get the phonograph!

-Boss, we're here!

Boss, we're here!
Well?
Now where's he going?
A drunk sailor!
Drunk from what?
You just better watch out!
Time to go home now!
Understand? Home!
We got problems.
We have to go see the company.
They sent for us.
Who'll explain?
Me! Because of her!
Ya couldn't shave?
lt's not proper!
-Stay there.
-OK.
lt's not your business!
Who are you?
-Nobody.
-A nobody!
Yes, a nobody!
Then get your pay from the cashier
and get out!
lf l'm nobody,
ya can pay me off for good!
ls the ''Atalante'' captain here?
He won't take up much of my time!
There you are!
The first mate of the ''Atalante!''
Come in!
Just you alone!
Close the door!
l got no time to waste!
lt's really true.
We're nobodies.
Waiting your turn?
Better hurry!
The pay window closes at 6!
Does the ''Atalante'' captain
do his job or not?
Are the facts
in the file just jokes?
Not jokes, just rumors.
You say he commands the ''Atalante?''
Ya could be in trouble.
Ya already had your share.
And not only here!
Don't think l don't know that!
Let me tell ya a good one...
ls the boss in command
of the ''Atalante'' or not?
Who else would be in command?
l'm not paid to do it.
The kid doesn't make the barge sail
by blowing on her sails!
l mean, even so, really...
After all, in the end,
well, it's true!
ln my opinion,
it's all just bunk!
We'll discuss it later.
l got more problems
than just the ''Atalante''.
Work it out with your boss!
Yeah, we'll discuss it later.
Goodbye!
And maybe see you
sooner than you think!
That file's not my problem!
Who do they take me for?
lnto the wastebasket!
The captain of ''La Belle Am√©lie'' !
Loisselet!
Come in!
l've had enough of this!
This won't take long,
you'll see!
The boss almost got himself
fired by the company.
This can't go on.
l gotta find her.
You're gonna look for her?
Yes, we'll look for her.
Have ya seen the boss's mug?
l'll bring her back!
-Going now?
-Not on Bastille Day!
