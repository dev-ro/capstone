The Tigress
- What are you doing?
- The bear walk, sir.
The bear walk? Out!
- Do you know what this is?
- Yes, sir.
They're camera traps.
If an animal crosses the sensor,
it gets filmed.
That's how we'll find the tiger.
So get the hang of it.
Tell madam the camera traps
are set.
She's on her way here.
- There's a problem over here.
- Ma'am?
Come.
Did you know this watering hole
is dry?
Did you know this watering hole
is dry?
How long has it been dry?
What's the contractor doing?
He's legislator GK Singh's
brother-in-law.
He doesn't listen to us.
If you talk to him,
he might listen to you.
A bear, a bear!
It made me jump with fear!
I know bears are vegetarians,
but if you suddenly surprise it,
it can tear off your scalp.
So right. A Mr Saiprasad
was your predecessor.
One day he suddenly came upon
a bear.
Mr Saiprasad let out a roar
and the bear ran for the hills.
Saiprasad was a great man.
He kept us all on a tight rein.
A superman!
A superman!
What's the contractor's name?
Manish. Mr Manish.
- Call him to the office
tomorrow. - Yes, madam.
You know what happens when
watering holes dry up?
- Yes, madam.
- What happens?
'Please keep the door closed.'
Ma'am, you arrived
here a month ago
and we only just meet.
My brother-in-law is busy
with the elections.
So time flies campaigning.
Madam, some barfi?
Orange-flavoured.
They're in season.
Are you responsible
for the watering holes?
Yes, madam.
You get paid on time?
Yes, madam.
So why isn't the work done?
Maybe pastries or cakes
are more to your taste?
Show cause notice.
Ma'am!
It's such a minor issue
for such a big jungle.
You have all the power.
- Please be lenient with me.
- Sir.
I saw your car outside.
I just dropped by.
- So we get to meet.
- Yes, sir.
- How's GK?
- Fine, sir.
His knees still aching?
A little. Campaigning means
running around, sir.
Don't worry.
I'm getting him special oil made
from jungle herbs.
My mother-in-law used it.
Now she's fine.
Prancing about like a deer.
Vidya, I have urgent
work with him.
OK? Come on.
My gate is broken.
- I'll send someone.
- When?
Madam, shall I give the barfi
to the staff?
'The election battle is on!'
It's a free for all here.
Everyone wants their way.
Remember this is a new posting,
Vidya.
It'll soon work out.
That's not it, Pawan. It's been
9 years. No growth, no incentive.
As soon as I get my promotion
in December, I'll resign.
Vidya, how can you resign now?
I didn't want to stress you, but
I had better tell you now.
My company is in a bad way
because of the recession.
Many have lost their jobs.
And you know how poorly
I did in the appraisals.
Because of Noronha.
Bloody idiot.
Remember what he said?
"He works but has no passion."
He wants passion?
The idiot.
At least you have
a government job.
Recession-proof, benefits
and job security too.
'Don't even consider resigning.
'Just do your work.
'And take home your salary.
'I never aimed to be the CEO.
'Nor did you want to be Chief
Warden in the Forest Department.
'You know what I mean?'
Hello. Yes, what is it?
What? Where? OK.
- Babbal, take me to Jondra.
- Yes, madam.
- Was it a tiger?
- I don't know.
Must be a tiger, madam.
Why? What makes you think that?
It's just the lay of the land,
madam.
Jungles and fields are
interconnected.
To go from one part of the
jungle to the other,
they must cross the fields.
So the lives of both animals
and people are endangered.
I was sitting on the hillock.
I heard the tiger roar and ran.
So you didn't see it?
No, madam, I didn't see it.
I ran as fast as I could.
Mohan!
All routine, madam. You
shouldn't have bothered coming.
Informing you is protocol.
Let's go to the kill site.
When did you first
see the tiger?
A week ago. It comes
in the evenings
when the cattle are grazing.
It looks and goes away.
If you knew its movements,
why didn't you tell us?
Well? Why didn't you tell us?
This is the season they come.
He's right, madam.
The tiger must've attacked it
about 50 metres from here.
Then dragged it and dragged it,
and dragged the buffalo here.
These pugmarks belong
to a different tiger.
But I can't make out
if it's male or female.
Pasha is the only male
tiger here.
Last week I saw another tiger
as I was walking home.
But it fled into the bushes.
I couldn't identify it, but
I've entered it in the logbook.
The paperwork is done.
The camera traps are set up.
- Good.
- Listen carefully!
I don't want to see any of you
in the jungle. OK?
What are you saying, sir?
So where can we go?
Where will our cattle graze?
OK! So lead them to their death
and collect the compensation.
Compensation?
Our cattle are dying.
One minute. Mohan!
Look, we all know
a tiger returns to eat its prey.
The cameras are in place.
We'll have the footage tomorrow.
Then we'll identity the tiger. OK?
I'll be off.
Madam, you must do something
soon. Our livelihood is at stake.
There's no need to worry.
But you must stay alert.
It won't be long.
If you don't bring your cattle here,
the tiger will have nothing to hunt.
It'll just go back
into the jungle.
I'll leave now.
Faster!
Any faster I'll trip.
WARNING!
OK.
- Jai Hind, sir!
- Jai Hind.
- Identified the tiger?
- Not yet, sir.
We'll need a DNA sample
to be sure of its identity.
DNA sample? Where do we find
a DNA collector?
- We can ask the Bhopal office...
- Sir!
Noorani? How can you do it?
In 2017, I attended a DNA
workshop. You sent me there, sir.
Yes. Correct!
I sent you there.
You can. He can.
- Sir...?
- One second.
Vidya, our new DFO.
This is Hassan Noorani.
The college nearby, Chaganlal
Maganlal. He's professor of Zoology there.
That's his first claim to fame.
Claim no. 2:
He's a butterfly expert.
Not butterfly, sir. Moth.
'Maut?' Death?
The Lord of Death?
Moth, sir. Lepidoptera, patanga,
parwana.
That moth! Got it.
Moths remind me of a poem.
Recite, sir!
Please, please, sorry.
'The moth knew deep in his heart
'Loving the flame,
life would depart'
Bravo!
'The moth knew deep in his heart,
loving the flame, life would depart
'If by chance he was born again
'He'd fly to the flame
only to be slain!'
Excellent!
Good, no? Nice!
A great poet. Ahmed Ferozabadi.
Sir, it's Faridabadi.
Ahmed Faridabadi.
- Ferozabadi.
- Faridabadi, sir.
- Ahmed Faridabadi?
- Yes, sir.
Ahmed Faridabadi! Correct.
How can a professor be wrong?
So, it's done?
- Yes, sir.
- The DNA...
I'll do it, ma'am.
Sir, what about the proposal
I gave you?
We talked about it, sir.
Yes, yes! The proposal?
Correct, correct. One second.
Vidya, on Sunday evening
Noorani wants to stage a show
for the villagers.
Done? Done!
Thank you, sir.
Kaka!
Yes?
How did it get in?
- You know the brown female cat?
- No, I don't.
You do know her!
This is her daughter.
Don't let her inside.
I really don't like cats.
But, madam, you know that
old one-eyed tom cat?
It has a huge face.
You can see it on the roof.
- So?
- He attacks pigeons.
He's eyeing this kitten.
So I brought her inside
for her safety.
OK. But keep her on the verandah.
Don't let her in here.
Give her something to eat.
Some fish, or whatever there is.
Yes.
Come, sweetie. Your granny lived
here. So did your mummy.
Your other grandma too.
Come, come.
Brothers! Animals are
not our enemies.
They just love something
we love too. What's that?
Chocolate! Mobile!
They love a peaceful life!
If you go into the jungle,
what will happen, my friends?
Tell me what will happen.
The tiger will think you're food
and have a quick bite.
Will you go into the jungle?
No, we won't go!
- What will the tiger do to you?
- Eat us up.
Very good.
You're strolling in the jungle
and you see the tiger. What then?
Careful!
Freeze like a statue.
If you stand perfectly still,
he'll quietly walk away.
See?
Madam, will you say
a few words?
Vidya madam is our new
Divisional Forest Officer.
Please come.
Thank you.
Namaste.
Noorani-ji,
our tiger, Mr Sagar, and the
village headman, Mr Sunil Uikey.
On behalf of the Forest
Department,z I'd like to extend my thanks
for sharing your problems
with us...
"When GK returns to power,
our time will surely flower!
"When GK returns to power,
our time will surely flower!
"When GK returns to power,
our time will surely flower!
"When GK returns to power,
our time will surely flower!"
I thank you all for coming here
this evening.
It's our good fortune that the
esteemed legislator,
Mr GK is with here today.
Applause!
I am the only one who can
solve your problems.
You no longer need to take your
goats into the jungle to graze.
To all livestock owners!
I promise to deliver cattle feed
to your home. And free at that!
I will also erect electric
fences round your fields.
So no wild animals will
dare enter your land.
"When GK returns to power,
our time will surely flower!"
And as far as the tiger goes,
this is our territory, not his!
If the tiger dares to
enter our space,
we'll teach him a lesson,
and dispatch him to a zoo
or a circus!
"When GK returns to power,
our time will surely flower!
"When GK returns to power.
our time will surely flower!
"When GK returns to power.
our time will surely flower!
"When GK returns to power.
our time will surely flower!"
Are you thirsty?
Go, you can wander about.
Get these goats out of here!
Madam, they won't let us near
the body. How will we take it away?
- Where's Mohan?
- On sick leave.
- Sick leave? What's wrong?
- He's sick.
Shut up!
Till GK Singh and Mr Bansal
get here
and take responsibility for his
death, no one touches the body.
PK, I need a DNA sample to
identify the animal that killed him.
Quiet! You people perform on stage
for the benefit of GK's campaign.
- What's going on? - This is
Mr PK Singh. Ex-legislator.
Madam is our new DFO.
Why are you stopping my men
from doing their job?
You were a legislator yourself.
You know it's against the law
to obstruct government procedure.
Madam, don't teach me the law.
I have a lot of respect
for women.
You're like a sister to me.
GK and Bansal are always
desperate to be seen.
But when there's trouble,
they send a lady officer.
Mr PK, can we talk in private?
Please.
What happened is terrible.
It shouldn't have happened.
I'm in charge now.
The body will rot
if it isn't moved.
It'll attract maggots.
Madam, you're not trying to
understand my words.
Trust me. We'll do whatever
needs doing.
Let them carry on!
Where are you going?
- To get a DNA sample.
- Mr PK has agreed to let us through.
Please step aside.
- Do I tie it here?
- No, over there.
The left paw.
People come to me for help.
My father was a legislator too.
Elected four times.
Serving people ran in his blood.
I respect you, madam,
so I'm letting it go this time.
Step back. Make way.
Lift the lever. Careful.
Put it down.
All sides done?
It must be secured
on all four sides.
Shukla, it's fine there.
The cage is all set up.
If we live near animals,
we must co-exist with them.
And understand them.
All done?
The tiger will be lured inside.
Mr Bansal, these men are hunters.
DK and Ali.
They've killed 24 tigers
and 6 leopards.
6 tigers and 24 leopards.
Anything salty to munch on?
They'll do your job.
I'm sorry.
I cannot give you permission.
For your kind information,
our department has made all
the arrangements.
A rescue team is ready.
A committee of experts
is on standby.
The cages have been set up.
I promise, you'll have no cause
for complaint.
You must be very busy nowadays.
Yes! Busy serving the public!
So busy you didn't even see
the victim.
I met the lady DFO.
She was there? Nice gesture,
very good.
Actually, I was out of town.
On tour.
Look, Mr Bansal, there'll always
be transfers and tours.
If this gets out of hand,
there'll be big trouble.
I understand.
Sir, remember I talked about
a transfer?
Sir, of course I'm here
to work for you.
But please transfer me anywhere.
I don't like this place, sir.
Can't you hear me?
She must be studying.
Why must you nag her?
Poor Montu doesn't get anything
to eat.
His mother eats it all up.
I'll tie them up separately.
- Montu, come, come.
- Yesterday his mother ate it all.
Don't get distracted.
- Do your homework.
- That's what I'm doing.
The compensation cheque.
I don't want it.
What use is it to me?
We were together for years.
What use is a cheque?
Your tiger has endangered all
our lives. What's your solution?
- Our goats are starving.
- We had to go into the jungle.
You were warned, weren't you?
Then why did he go into the jungle?
Pyarelal-ji!
Have you no shame?
Lakhan is dead and you talk
about warning us.
You know why he went there.
His goats were starving.
If they'd died, how would Lakhan
have survived?
If your department can't do
anything, we will.
No, no, no.
Don't take the law into your own
hands. You'll end up in jail.
- Is that your advice?
- Look, I'm telling you...
Carry on.
You know the land where
our cattle used to graze?
Saiprasad has planted
teak trees there.
It's a teak plantation now.
We aren't allowed there.
Where was your law then?
Where are we supposed to go?
To the jungle, where else?
Your name?
Jyoti.
I'm on the village committee.
Jyoti, I'm so glad you told me.
I'll make sure something is done.
We'll see.
That's a female.
- It's T13, sir.
- It's Joni, sir.
- Joni.
- No, it's T13.
It's Joni.
Make up your minds!
T13? Or Joni?
It's T12.
- So it's T12 now!
- Yes, sir.
- What makes you so sure?
- She has a mark on her forehead.
A mark?
See the mark on her forehead?
It's T12. Neelam's daughter.
Who is her father?
- Could be Star Male.
- What?
Or T1. Maybe it's T1.
Amazing! They lead
complicated lives too.
This is T12 when she was
four months old.
I took this photo then.
- Isn't she sweet?
- Adorable.
Here she is with her mother
Neelam.
You know the man who got killed?
The tiger must've got confused
and mistook Lakhan for its prey.
That's why the unfortunate
incident occurred.
Sir, do you remember
my proposal?
We should move everyone out
and convert the whole area
into a national park.
Sir, people depend on the jungle
and vice-versa.
We should not lose this balance.
I agree, sir. We must find a
solution, not create new problems.
Very well.
We'll set up a monitoring
committee. Send a recommendation.
That's enough for today.
- I'd like to discuss something, sir.
- What?
Bansal sir!
Mr GK's driver is here.
So? What is it to me?
Cat got your tongue?
What's he want?
- The oil.
- The oil?
Saiprasad has planted teak trees
on the land
where the villagers' cattle
grazed.
So?
So they're forced to go
to the jungle, sir.
What are you saying, Vidya?
According to the annual plan, we
must plant 100,000 trees every year.
That was the only fertile land.
There's no other fertile land
nearby.
We were ordered to plant trees,
so we had to.
- So where can their cattle graze, sir?
- Wherever! Not our problem.
They can go anywhere.
This area is so huge.
They can use civilian land.
No one's stopping them.
Let them go there.
This is too much!
Not our problem.
What must we focus on?
The tiger! Get it?
Focus on the tiger.
Where the hell did I put it?
- Mr Noorani.
- Sir?
I've lost a tiny bottle of oil.
Is it there?
Maybe it's there.
Carry on. So what's your next
move? I'm listening.
The cages from the National Park
have arrived.
When all the camera
traps are set,
we can track T12's movements.
Found it?
No, sir.
What a pain!
Can't keep anything safe.
Can you help me? Look in the
bedside table drawer...
The goat looks terrified.
- The tigress's pugmarks.
- They're everywhere.
She circled the cage all night.
But she didn't enter it.
She's a sharp one!
She won't fall for our trap.
You were saved, kiddo.
How will we find the tiger?
Tigers do not like the heat.
They prefer shaded areas.
They like walking on open paths.
No creepers or spiders in their way.
If a cobweb gets into a tiger's
eye, hunting becomes difficult.
So they prefer open paths,
the river, the canals.
Pugmarks tell us if a tiger
has passed this way.
Watch it!
Go slow. Be careful.
If you go into the jungle 100 times,
you might see the tiger once.
But one thing's for sure, the
tiger has seen you 99 times!
Be alert.
Let me know if you hear
the faintest sound.
The tiger always leaves signs.
Scratch marks or pugmarks.
They make scratch marks on the
trees with their claws,
or leave pugmarks on the ground.
If you see either of these signs,
what must you do?
Come and tell us at once.
If the birds cry out or
the monkeys are agitated
then let us know.
They are all signs that
a tiger is nearby.
Keep alert and stay safe.
Here, sir.
'T12 was spotted in the fields
at Chandrakuan.
- 'Get there on the double. Over.'
- OK, sir!
- Who saw it first?
- I did.
Is there a raised viewing
platform nearby?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Take me there.
Let's go.
He saw the tiger first.
What's going on?
Stop!
Please be calm!
Let us do our job.
Go back! Do not chase the tiger!
Look over there.
Look everywhere!
It's not our job to control
crowds on civilian land. Let's go.
Look over there. That's where
the sound is coming from.
Hi.
Pawan, I've decided...
One minute, one minute.
Yes, Vidya?
It's a big mess here.
I've decided to sort things out.
Is someone there?
They're all here.
Why not say 'hi'?
- Hi, Vidya.
- Hi, Gaurav.
- Lady Tarzan!
- Hey, guys!
- Hi, Vidya. I'm Jude Noronha.
- Hello, Mr Noronha.
He muted the TV as soon
as he called you.
And we lost a wicket.
Vidya, what is it? Shall I
go to the other room?
No, no, no.
We'll talk tomorrow. I must have
an early night.
Long day in the field tomorrow.
OK. OK, bye then.
Bye!
Tuffy, don't worry.
I won't abandon you.
This land was lying idle, madam.
Only the villagers used it
for grazing.
So we used the land to plant
teak trees. It benefitted us.
What's the point of this land,
if it's of no use to the villagers?
You're right, madam.
Is there any other grazing
land nearby?
We'll check, madam.
Madam, this is Compartment 519-A.
It'll do.
Let's inspect the land. If it's OK,
we'll start the process quickly.
Yes, madam.
Good morning, madam.
How are you?
I'm fine, thank you.
And you are?
I thought we'd meet
in your office.
Then I heard you were here.
I am Ranjan Rajhans
alias Mr Pintu.
In Ratanpur, my estate was
converted into a resort.
Ratandhan Nature Retreat.
If you and your family feel like
a break, just say the word.
Thank you. What brings you here?
I'm a conservationist.
Oh! Are you working with an NGO?
No, madam. I'm a conservationist
by birth.
Meaning?
I can look into a tiger's eyes
and tell if it's a man-eater or not.
I see.
I came to help the
Forest Department.
Thank you but we
have a good team.
We don't need anyone's help.
I've killed 7 tigers and 32
leopards in 6 states, madam.
Experience counts for something.
Tell me something.
- How many have you captured
alive? - Excuse me?
I'm totally against working
with private hunters.
Besides, whatever needs doing,
we'll do it.
Think it over, madam.
We're a family of four generations
of hunters.
My grandfather,
Jung Bahadur Rajhans,
was a famous hunter during
the British Raj.
I have to inspect some land now.
Thank you.

Ma'am, what will you have?
Kala Khatta? Mango?
- No, I'll have that.
- Whiskey?
Hello, Nangia sir!
- I didn't know you were...
- Vidya Vincent!
Yes!
- When did you arrive?
- Just now.
Surprise visit.
I was on tour. So I thought
I'd stop by.
Congratulations on your
promotion.
Thank you.
So, after 6 years behind a desk,
finally, field work.
How many months has it been?
Two?
A month and half.
Still settling in.
Every new posting
has its challenges.
I heard about what
happened yesterday.
We had a foolproof plan, sir.
Our team was so disheartened.
The local politicians have made
it an election issue.
The problem is more complex
than it looks.
You have a tough job
on your hands.
But keep a thick skin.
Face the challenges bravely.
Keep up the good work.
It means a lot coming from you,
sir.
I've read your case studies
at the Forestry Institute.
They're still talked about.
Which ones?
The way you handled the poachers
in Panna.
- That was extraordinary.
- Please! That was ages ago.
I was the department's
angry young man then.
Best days of my career.
How is Nandita-ji?
Nandita? She's OK.
We've parted ways.
- I'm so sorry. I...
- No, no. It's OK.
It was the right thing to do.
It's hard finding a partner who understands
the responsibility of a forest officer.
And how is Mr...?
Pawan. He's good.
He's in Mumbai.
♪ I need a cup of hot tea,
and a girl to stir it! ♪
There's a training seminar next
week. I hope you'll make it.
Good. It'll be helpful for you.
I'll be there, sir.
Jai Hind, sir.
Look who's here! How are you?
- All well, Mohan?
- All good, sir.
Mr Bansal!
Sir, what a surprise! Did you
ask what he'll have?
Please come.
We'll need 15 days to cut
the crop.
This will be ready in 20-25 days.
Then we'll buy a motorcycle.
Can you even ride one?
I'll learn.
Can't be that difficult.
Sakshi doesn't stop playing.
Never studies.
- She won't get work after she
marries. - You crazy?
She's a real athlete.
She runs so fast.
Sakshi! Boys and girls!
Where are you going?
Come here!
She drives me crazy.
- Whose idea was it to go there?
- Hers!
- It was his.
- It was hers.
It was his idea.
She told us to go into jungle.
Why are you laughing?
What's so funny?
My son is leaving for college.
I'll cook him something.
Vegetables and bread.
- Shall I go?
- Yes.
I'll fetch some wood from
the jungle.
- Go through here.
- Hmm.
- It's really tough.
- I'm sure.
- Where's Pawan now?
- In Mumbai.
Need sugar.
Take a selfie. It's the rage now.
Just a minute.
Vidya!
Saiprasad!
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?
They've been singing
your praises.
They talk about you
wherever I go.
Is that so? Who's been talking
about me?
Pyarelal. The villagers.
Everyone.
Can I confess something?
It was a tough posting.
The first two months
were a nightmare.
Then I learned how to
handle things.
Karuna.
Thank you.
- Hello!
- Hi.
The Forest Department is a
legacy of the British Raj.
So work like them.
Bring in the revenue,
your superiors are happy,
promotion guaranteed.
You know the score.
You're smart.
Hello, Nangia sir.
Oh! Vidya Vincent.
- Please.
- Thank you!
I'm glad you came.
What news of your tiger?
Things seem to be under control.
Good, good.
Interesting bag.
From my previous posting.
Thank you!
Doing nothing will
achieve nothing.
I'll teach them a lesson.
You show up now?
We reported it 3 hours ago.
Why are you here?
Teach him a lesson!
Stop, please stop!
Mr Noorani, don't go any further.
The villagers are furious.
They set fire to our jeep.
Our guard Mukesh was beaten up.
You'll get hurt
if you do the DNA test.
Let's go back.
Is a balance between development
and environment essential?
But if you choose development,
you can't save the environment.
Save the environment, then you
break development's heart.
And so the EIA was created
to assess the environmental
impact of all projects.
So when discussing development,
we don't forget the environment.
- Do you have the salary file?
- Yes, sir.
I need it today.
Tell him PK is here.
I know, Mr PK,
but I'm telling you...
Bansal! Bansal!
Stop!
Bansal!
Bansal!
You can't go there!
Stop them! What's going on?
Bansal!
Bansal!
Hey! Where's Bansal?
Let's look here.
- Don't hit me.
- You shut up!
I made a mistake, a mistake.
I'll do whatever you say.
I made a mistake.
You made a mistake?
You didn't even come to see the
victim? Have you no shame?
Too busy campaigning for GK?
Made a mistake, eh?
Let him go. He has weak lungs.
Let go, please.
Get him some water.
Move aside.
- Give him some air.
- We're only talking.
Are you all right?
No point getting stressed.
Find a solution in 24 hours.
Problem solved.
OK.
Pandit-ji, what about my...?
Your problems will be solved,
Bansal-ji.
You'll be rewarded
for your efforts.
Sir, Mr Noorani did the DNA test.
The results are in.
As suspected, it's T12.
Nice! It's T12.
Sir, as per orders,
we can't kill her.
We must capture her and release
her in the National Park.
To capture the tigress, we'll
study the camera footage carefully...
...and study her movements.
Time: 2.40.
Look carefully. You'll see
her pugmarks.
Both left and right.
She seems to hunt every seven
or eight days.
With her movements,
we must also study her
feeding patterns.
If she's seen on the 6th day,
it means she might hunt in that
area a day or two later.
Understand?
That means we need to be alert
in those areas.
Based on our information, our
team will try to find the tigress.
Once we find her, we'll trap her
and tranquilise her.
The tranquilisation experts
are here from Kanha.
No need for all this, madam.
Just trust me. I'll handle it.
- What's your plan?
- I never plan.
A God-gift. All in here.
I can look into a tiger's eyes
and tell if it's a man-eater or not.
- Oh! Just by looking into
its eyes? - Absolutely!
Tell you what, let's make
the tiger's horoscope.
We'll study it and we'll know
when and where to trap it.
Once we find her, you can look
into her eyes and enlighten us.
The tranquilisation experts
will be ready.
It's not a joke. Vidya!
Hunting is no child's play.
Mr Bansal, you'll see,
if things go wrong
you'll be held responsible.
No, no, no. That won't happen.
We'll work as a team. OK?
Mr Pintu, you'll go with our
trackers. Use the tranquiliser dart.
And if that fails, no problem.
You'll know what needs doing.
But I want the job done fast.
No time wasting. OK?
Here. This is the area.
Be ready tomorrow.
Who's covering which
beat tomorrow?
Stop! Stop!
It's T12's poop.
Absolutely fresh. Six hours old.
No, sir. That's a leopard's
droppings.
Not a leopard! It's T12's.
She's somewhere close by.
We must find her.
She isn't far.
No, sir. Look carefully.
It's leopard's poo.
I've seen it.
Why are you arguing with me?
You're looking at years
of experience.
Hey, you!
Come here.
What did you find?
T12's pugmark.
The tigress must have crossed
the river here. See the pugmarks?
Very fresh.
Two or three hours old.
- Her pugmark.
- Madam!
Pugmarks here too.
According to protocol, we can't
track at night. So we'll stop now.
She could be heading from this
jungle to the other jungle.
But there's a field and village
in between.
- The Badarpur village.
- Yes.
Alert the villagers. I think
she'll pass through at night.
- Send some forest guards there.
- Yes, madam. Mukesh will go.
We'll start in the other
jungle tomorrow.
Yes, madam.
A warning from the
Forest Department!
No one must enter the jungle or
fields for 48 hours.
A tigress is on the prowl.
Make sure your cattle are safe.
And your children.
Hey, Forester! Switch off
that megaphone!
I own 80 acres here.
Don't stir up my farmhands.
Don't yell at him! He's telling
the truth. He isn't stirring us up.
He's warning us not to go to the fields.
A tigress is on the prowl.
You labourers had better come to
work. No excuses.
Excuses! Your workers
are explaining something to you.
There's a tigress on the prowl
in your fields. Don't you get it?
- Shut up, you old hag!
- Is that the way to talk?
If there's a tigress about,
no one will work your land.
Shut up, you old hag!
- A fresh pugmark.
- She can't be far away.
She's probably somewhere
on this side.
One minute, Mr Pintu.
Don't shoot!
That's Pasha. Not T12.
Pasha is a male tiger.
Shut up! You nuts?
My aim was perfect. You made me
miss the target.
That was Pasha. T12 has...
Must you insist on teaching me
how to identify a tiger?
If that tiger kills another man,
you'll be responsible.
I'll shoot you instead.
That wasn't T12.
What the hell are you doing?
Get in!
Roaming about like brave
little bunnies.
- Let's go.
- It was a male tiger.
Drive! Let's go.
Sir, it's the truth.
It was Pasha, a male tiger,
not a female.
He even threatened to shoot me.
- Why would I lie, sir?
- Shut up!
Don't talk nonsense!
What proof it was Pasha?
Do you take Mr Pintu
for some novice?
He's an expert.
He wouldn't just fire.
Sir, Mr Pintu loves hunting.
He wants to beat his own record.
It's sending out the wrong message.
If the solution is to shoot the tiger,
why have a Forest Department at all?
- He'd happily shoot any tiger.
- As if! I'll talk to him.
Please, sir.
I'll talk to Pintu.
I'll handle him.
I'm on it.
OK, sir.
Some water. Water!
This is the famous hunter,
Ranjan Rajhans, alias Mr Pintu.
Namaste!
We invited him here specially.
He'll save you from the
man-eating tigress.
Applause!
The truth is the Forest Department
only cares about their jungle.
They don't give a damn about you.
They're making fools of us.
Our region was hit by malaria
last year. How many died?
35, 40.
- GK didn't bring a single doctor.
- Right.
He's just fooling us.
If GK had done any work
in the last five years,
he would not need a hunter
to boost his election chances.
Have no fear.
I will have blood for blood.
That bloodthirsty tigress
will have to pay for her sins.
So, if you hear where
the tigress is,
come and tell us first.
"When GK comes to power,
our time will surely flower!
"When GK comes to power,
our time will surely flower!"
- "Who is the most loyal brother?
- PK, PK!"
- "Who is the most loyal brother?
- Brother PK!"
A token from the Forest Department
to compensate for your wage loss.
If you work, it might lessen your
dependency on the jungle and farming.
Madam, there are many women here
who can make things from bamboo.
They can weave baskets
and rice cleaners
and even colour them.
That's wonderful!
Our department will help you
sell your goods.
The camera footage shows signs
the tigress.
She's bound to come where
there are plenty of deer.
She might even be heading
to the river.
Let's inform madam immediately.
- Pintu must not hear.
- Not a chance!
Understand?
Forest Friends, these fields
and this jungle belong to you.
It's your responsibility
to protect them.
It's simple.
If the tiger exists,
so does the jungle.
If the jungle exists, there's
rain. If it rains, there's water.
If there's water,
there's human life.
Very good, very good.
We must save the jungle first.
Make friends with the animals.
Animals and people are all one.
Hey, brother!
We're forbidden to
go into the jungle.
Take your cattle to the land the
Forest Department has given us.
Our department has allotted you
land for grazing your cattle.
Avoid the jungle for now.
There are many rumours being
spread, don't believe any of them.
Have some.
Solve our problems and we'll
get ten villages to vote for you.
Brother, your problems all will
vanish. Don't worry.
I can shoot a tiger from a
kilometre away with this rifle.
This rifle has shot 25 tigers.
Can I hold it?
- May I touch it?
- Touching only.
- Anushka.
- Sir?
Take over the class.
I have some urgent work.
Noorani! What's the hurry?
Read this?
'200 forest guards are looking
for a man-eating tigress.'
That's right. We're trying.
They don't mention your name.
Sir, what's in a name?
The pleasure is in the work.
Come and see the jungle sometime.
She's made her way
from there to here.
- She may be heading to
Jalori Beat. - Why there?
Deer graze there,
so she'll get to eat.
Or she might come to this canal
to drink.
- That's unlikely.
- Why?
The Forest Friends are
monitoring the area.
She won't come this side.
Ignore the rumours. I don't
have any further information.
Here comes Bansal.
I'm Nirmohi, the journalist.
Any progress on T12?
Yes, yes, things are moving.
My name is Charandas.
What's going on, sir?
- What do you mean?
- How long more?
Everything is fine.
They say the opposition has told
you not to capture the tiger.
So the government's under
pressure and people get fired up.
Really? Who said that?
Phone forwards, sir.
Forwards are a dime a dozen.
I even got one today.
In Mumbai, they found a diamond
inside a potato.
So there's potato panic-buying!
Never mind.
You'll be informed when we hold
a press briefing. OK?
Pachode, handle him.
Please, please leave.
- Jai Hind!
- Jai Hind.
What's the update?
Sir.
- Who's that?
- T12 and her two cubs.
What a pain!
So capture the cubs with the
mother. More work for you.
Don't let them fool you.
The cubs will be man-eaters
like their mother.
Sparing them is a big mistake.
What logic is that?
You want to be a hero by killing
milk-drinking cubs?
Bansal, keep this butterfly
expert away from me.
Please, please. Calm down!
We're a team. Let's work
as a team.
Sir, we have no proof
the cubs are man-eaters.
We must protect them.
Excuse me, madam.
I know everything there's to
know about animals.
You're less experienced.
What scientific proof have you
to say the cubs are man-eaters?
Find a solution. Calm down.
No animal is a man-eater.
It's just hungry.
The notion is wrong.
We'll find a solution!
- We'll find a solution.
We'll do something. - OK.
Please.
It's a jackal.
Point the light that way.
If there's any movement around
here, I'm informed immediately.
Who gave you permission
to come here?
Must I ask for permission to
do my job?
I could have you punished
for breaking the law.
- Pyarelal!
- Yes, madam.
Section 26,
Indian Forest Act, 1927.
Trespassing in the jungle
without permission.
Section 9,
Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
Using high intensity lights
in the jungle at night.
Entering the forest
illegally to hunt.
You're caught red-handed.
Know how many friends
I have in high places?
Is that so? Tell us more about
your friends in high places.
Babbal is recording you.
Amar, turn the car around.
Hard over.
Reverse!
Can you drive or can't you?
Turn the wheel.
Keep reversing.
Vidya-ji!
Sorry to bother you so late.
- Not at all. I'm glad you came.
- Namaste!
Reshma and my daughter, Ayesha.
- Hi!
- Vidya ma'am.
This isn't a first for Pintu.
I have a long list
of his offences.
Whenever he's called to capture
an animal,
not a single animal has survived.
Not one!
We'll send this letter
to the NTCA.
Bansal will fry too.
Noorani-ji, if we send a report,
a committee will consider it.
It'll take time.
How do we stop Pintu till then?
I think we should talk
to Mr Nangia.
Don't say a word to Nangia.
We should send this letter
to the higher authorities.
Let me talk to him. He's a
well-wisher. Trust me.
One minute. I'll be right back.
No, sir. When I heard, I landed
there and found Pintu.
He told me he knows people
in high places.
That's what he said.
There's no doubt about it.
Yes, sir. Thank you.
He says Mr Pintu is leaving
in the morning.
He said there's no point complaining.
They're all in it together.
Vidya-ji, think it over.
Our case is strong.
We have witnesses too.
We shouldn't let this
opportunity go.
There's no time.
Either we fight or we save
the tigress.
Hurry up!
Load the bags up.
Quick!
Mr Pintu, how many tigers
have you shot recently?
What did you say? Clear off!
Your Mr Nangia turned out
to be a magician.
The hunter flew away at 3am!
Good riddance!
They're heading that way.
Antelopes graze around there.
These days I only see pugmarks
in my dreams.
The deer killed two days ago?
We found images of T12 near it last night.
At least she came back to feed.
A tiger always returns to its
prey at least once.
T12 is as sharp as a razor.
Whenever we've set a trap for her,
she somehow figures it out
and heads to another part
of the jungle.
- Please get the luggage down.
- Yes, madam.
- Hi!
- Hi!
- I have a surprise for you.
- What?
- It's a surprise.
- Please tell me.
- At least act surprised, please.
- Tell me.
Surprise!
My daughter-in-law looks
a proper officer!
You look very tired.
Are you tired?
Come, let's sit down.
What an adorable cat!
I'm glad you have a pet kitten.
Practice for the future.
What practice, Mummy?
My Tuffy is very independent.
No diapers, no school fees,
no trouble.
Your wife is a toughie too!
But she's right, Ma.
Cats are no problem.
If we had a kid, I'd go bald.
Like Papa.
Our son is always making fun
of his father's bald head.
But he has a sweet nature.
Talking of nature, you said
we'll go to the forest on Sunday.
Sure, we can go. Why not?
I might be busy. My driver
Babbal will take you.
Not Babbal. Our bride,
the Forest Officer, will take us!
- Tomorrow is Sunday.
Isn't it a holiday? - I have work.
You'd make Pawan's mother so
happy if you took us.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Hardly a surprise then.
Was Kaka's cooking OK?
You're just as you were...
in college.
Not at all.
Yes, you are.
I'm not.
Shall I put the light off?
- What was that?
- Is everything all right?
- Mummy, everything's fine.
- All fine.
- OK, OK. Enjoy, enjoy!
- Enjoy?
Fresh marks. The cubs are
with her.
It's T12.
She's come a long way.
Last time we spotted T12,
she was here.
- Now she's here. Correct?
- Yes, sir.
Good. T12 is making her way
back to the jungle.
If she keeps going, she'll soon
end up in the National Park.
The river is there too.
Lots of small animals breed
there. She'll get to eat.
- There's a problem.
- What?
This.
There was a jungle
here till recently.
Now there's this. A copper mine.
The jungle over there? That's where
T12 and her cubs are now.
The National Park over there
is where she's headed.
We've made a highway there.
A factory here - all destroyed!
How will she make it?

My husband gave it to me
on Karwa Chauth.
- Lovely design.
- Made in Lucknow.
I see.
Do you celebrate Karwa Chauth
in the South?
- The custom doesn't exist there.
- Shall we go? I'm ready.
- Must you look so plain?
- Plane?
No, no! A plain Jane.
No bangles, no necklace.
What about that 9-carat diamond
necklace I gave you?
Mrs Noorani must see it's our
bride who's come with us.
Today's kids! I gave her so much
jewellery. She never wears it.
It'll please Pawan, sweetie.
Enough!
Now you two must think
about children.
I told you, we don't want
any children.
It's OK for now. But what
happens in your old age?
Travelling, yoga, gardening,
reading, writing...
When you're old, you'll need
someone to take care of you.
You can't spend your whole life
looking after dogs and cats.
Do you know how much Pawan's
mother and I want to see you with children?
Wow! So beautiful.
I don't want to be
the fly in the ointment.
I must doll up and you can go
as you are.
It'll please your mom. What's
wrong with my clothes?
Nothing. Let's go.
You're really looking very
beautiful. Vidya!
Reshma-ji, the biryani is
delicious. Did you make it?
Hassan's special recipe.
He made it.
Hassan Sahib, you made it?
What masalas did you add?
Nothing special, Sudha-ji.
Fry potatoes in some mustard oil...
A potato's temperament
goes with everything!
Did I tell you?
Pawan is the Head of Potato
Selection at Jethamal Chips.
Really?
I'm the quality control manager,
actually.
- What's the difference?
- Big difference, Mummy.
It's not the same thing.
I've always wanted to know
something.
- How come chips are all the
same size? - Because...
Reshma-ji, tell me, you live
in the jungle,
they're always busy, so
how do you get by?
I get by. Besides we're moving
to Mumbai soon.
Mumbai?
I was about to tell you. A
private college has offered me a job.
The salary's good and it'll be
good for my daughter's education.
My brother lives in Mumbai too.
- They'll miss you.
- When do you leave?
In a month or two.
Congratulations!
Moving is a good idea.
Good or bad. Who knows! I'll
leave only after we've found T12.
T12!
Your Babbal took us round and
round the jungle for an hour.
All we saw were crows.
- Vidya, no work calls on weekends.
- Mine's not a corporate job.
Yes, Mohan?
What? Where?
I'm on my way.
It's Mohan. He says it's urgent.
We must leave at once.
- Where to?
- Bhoot Palasi Lake.
- What's wrong?
- Tell you later.
Excuse me! Reshma,
look after them.
Why must you go? Send a junior.
Pawan!
Leaving your food midway
brings bad luck.
Mummy, it's work!
Can't you do it tomorrow?
Go with her. It's too late for
her to go alone.
I'm coming with you.
Sweetie, be careful.
I'm coming with you.
- Keep this.
- Try the 'kheer'.
I'll take care of them.
Shagun. Shagun!
Shagun. Shagun!
Shagun. Shagun!
Shagun, where are you?
We're looking for you.
- Shagun, where are you?
- Shagun!
Shagun! Shagun!
- Have you found him?
- Where are you, Shagun?
His body's been found.
- His body?
- Yes. Near the pond.
Shagun!
What happened?
Madam, a body was found
near the pond.
I'm monitoring the situation.
It's not safe to go there.
- Did you inform the police?
- They're on their way.
Didn't GK Singh promise to save
us from the tigress?
Now see!
GK doesn't give a damn
about you people.
Or your safety, your future
or your lives.
We can't stand by watching this
circus. We must do something.
- Not now, madam. They're too
angry. - He's right.
Madam, please!
Nothing will happen
if you remain silent.
We must raise our voices!
Spare no one.
We will not be calmed down!
Those marks were made
by a bear, PK.
If we this was a city, the
government would take immediate action.
What are you staring at?
The spectacle of death?
That's what they've come to see.
I know their game.
You get paid every time a tiger
is saved. Right?
What if you were paid
for every life saved?
He was killed by a bear,
not a tiger.
We should tell them.
No one will believe you.
I'll try and do a DNA test.
Mr GK... Mr PK...
Professor, think carefully
before you do anything.
If you try playing
with their feelings,
they'll set the whole jungle
on fire.
Yes, we will!
We'll spare no one!
Where's the tiger?
PK's is giving bad hooch
to people and killing them off...
...while he plays your saviour.
Rubbish!
PK and his men have killed him.
What have you ever done, GK?
You talk nonsense!
I'll do better than you.
What have you ever done?
Careful!
Easy! There's a body lying there.
What are you doing?
- Are you OK?
- Yes.
What happened?
We won't leave tomorrow, if you
prefer. We're so worried about you.
Mummy, there's no need to worry.
I'm fine.
What's the problem? Tell me.
It's nothing to worry about.
It's very late. We should
all go to sleep.
Don't be scared, Amma.
"Down with GK! Down with GK!"
"Down with GK! Down with GK!"
The people are up in arms against
the system. They're furious.
"Down with GK! Down with GK!"
- We will not back down.
- No, we won't.
If they don't get justice,
they will burn the jungle down.
We will burn the jungle!
Put it down.
The other way around.
Turn it around.
Lift it slightly.
Come, sir.
Jai Hind!
Nangia, what's going on?
Why did I need to come?
- We're doing our best, sir.
- This way, please.
The situation is out of control.
Until a solution is found,
Nangia, you stay put.
Mr Pintu will lead the operation.
He's an old friend.
You'll do exactly as he says.
Sir, the man was killed by a bear,
not a tiger. We have proof.
- Our new DFO, sir, Vidya Vincent.
- Sir.
If 6 out of 10 people believe a
tiger killed him, then a tiger did.
Your proof will not shake
their belief.
No, sir...
Sir, be rest assured.
I've taken charge now.
You look after the situation
here. The elections are near.
Should I go campaigning?
Or be stuck in a jungle?
- I'll handle it, sir.
- OK. Do it!
Look at this bloodthirsty
tigress carefully!
Look into her evil eyes.
She waits for nightfall
to strike.
She does not attack cattle,
but innocent villagers.
The man-eating tigress is on the
prowl. Will the reign of terror end?

Mr Pintu!
- Where did you get it?
- From the zoo.
'Cheetah calling Lion,
Cheetah calling Lion!'
'T12 and her two cubs are
heading into the jungle.
'I repeat.
'T12 and two cubs are heading
into the jungle.
'Send the tranquilizer team
immediately.'
Start the jeeps! To Logur!
Make sure there's no mess up.
- Hurry!
- Give me the tranquiliser gun.
Sir, droppings.
Deer droppings, sir.
No sign of the tigress.
We're searching the jungle.
'We'll inform you of any
movement.'
Look. Cub pugmarks. Their mother's
pugmarks. They went that way.
Pugmarks here too.
Found anything?
No. It was a bison.
Drive!
It's getting dark.
We'll resume operations tomorrow.
'All teams return to base camp.'
OK, sir.
Babbal, Aradhana...
Mr Pintu! Mr Nangia's orders.
Stop the jeep.
Stop! See who's coming behind us.
Amar, pull over.
Pull over!
Mr Pintu! We just saw the tigress
cross the road.
- Half a kilometre back.
- Please hurry, sir!
- Was she alone?
- We couldn't see clearly.
Listen to me. Don't tell anyone.
Get it?
No need for that.
We want to be rid of it too.
Please hurry.
Turn around.
Keep reversing.
- Shall we inform Mr Nangia?
- No. I'll handle it.
- What's that?
- A male tiger's urine.
- It's against the law.
- Ssh. Calm down!
Where did you get it?
- From the zoo.
- The zoo!
Mr Pintu, I'll be fired.
Mr Pintu will handle it.
- I'll be held accountable.
- Ssh!
No one will fire you.
I'll handle it. Just calm down.
The tigress isn't far from here.
She'll hear you and escape.
So be quiet. I'll handle it.
Sir, what have you done?
It is T12, right?
Yes.
Shoot the tranquiliser.
What are you waiting for?
Shoot the tranquiliser dart.
What a beauty!
Her cubs can't be very far.
Let's go.
Search that side.
Shine the light over there.
I need some light.
Come on.
There's something wrong here.
The dart was fired later.
She was shot first.
Look.
It's a pre-planned murder,
Vidya-ji. It's a murder.
This is ridiculous, sir.
We must investigate.
Oh, there's no need for that.
I have Mr Pintu's statement. He's clean.
How can you give him a clean
chit without an investigation?
It's clear. She was shot,
then the dart was fired.
Listen. I know how to handle
this situation. I know what I'm doing.
But, sir, why are you avoiding
an investigation?
What do you mean, Vidya?
I'm the one in charge here.
I'm in charge.
And listen.
Learn to pick your battles.
Pathetic.
Sorry?
You, sir, are pathetic.
How dare you!
Leave!
Coward.
You've done all you could.
If you want to quit your job,
we'll get by somehow. It's OK.
We'll manage.
Pawan, can we talk tomorrow?
Yes. Call whenever.
- Bye.
- Bye.
T12's cubs are now orphaned.
They're roaming about hungry.
Can they survive in a
dangerous jungle?
How long will the Forest
Department take to find them?
They never stop talking,
passing it off as news.
Any update on T12's cubs?
- We're tracking them, sir.
- Get it over with soon.
This time don't involve
politicians or the media.
Don't stress.
The job will be done quietly.
Even I won't know about it.
Have you sent Vidya
her transfer letter?
It's here, sir.
I have it on me. But she hasn't
shown up since yesterday.
Shall I send it to her house?
Jai Hind.
Office, madam?
Babbal!
Yes, ma'am?
- Take me to Logur.
- OK, ma'am.
Hurry.
Come, madam.
Madam...
They ate two chickens. After all
they don't have their mother.
- Does anyone else know?
- No, no one.
Thank you!
- Thank you, Forest Friends.
- Welcome, ma'am.
How can we accept defeat so
easily, ma'am?
Mr Noorani, good news.
He's here.
Welcome! Welcome!
I'm ACF Mohan.
We heard only yesterday
you were coming.
We've been waiting.
Sir, this is Pyarelal.
Namaste.
They sing your praises, sir.
Please...
- Mukesh, bring some tea.
- Special tea.
I told you to change this.
The sign will be
ready this evening.
This evening, sir.
When was this office
last painted?
Only 8 months ago, sir.
Doesn't look like it.
It looks pretty shabby.
Who's the contractor?
Sir, the legislator GK Singh's
brother-in-law.
So? Why didn't you complain?
Sir, he won't listen to us.
If you talk to him,
he might listen to you.
- What's the contractor's name?
- Manish, sir.
Call him here tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
Sir, your predecessor was a
Madam Vidya. She was very strict.
She had a fight
with the contractor.
Next day she gave him a warning.
Sir, she kept us on a very
tight rein.
She was terrific.
A real superman!
Yes.
Why are all the cameras on this
side? What about other side?
- They're in the warehouse.
- Warehouse?
That antler is broken. The one
at the back.
- Number three.
- We'll get it repaired, madam.
What about the
crack on its face?
We'll have it repaired.
Ma'am, what about the budget?
I've sent in the proposal.
I should get an answer in a few days.
What happened to your list?
I'll check it, madam.
- He's from the time of the
British. - He's 70-years old.
From Uttarakhand.
