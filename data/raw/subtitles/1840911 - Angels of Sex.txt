Go, girls!
What are you up to?
- Let me go.
- What are you up to?
What are you up to, kid?
He's robbing him!
Get outta here.
Are you alright?
This is yours.
Oh, fuck. Thanks.
- Take it easy.
- Careful.
Up. That's it.
I'll call him now. Dad.
He's always the same.
Your father can't let it go.
- Do you think Bruno's coming?
- I'll call him now.
What do you bet
the bad guy's still alive?
What? They stuck
an iron bar in his chest,
shot him
and threw a bomb at him.
- Hi.
- Hi.
What's up?
Hi.
What's up?
This is the good bit.
- What's up, Rai?
- What's up, kid?
- You alright?
- Just a bit woozy.
Sure you don't want to
go to hospital?
No, I just want to call my girl.
I'll charge your mobile.
But get that cut cleaned?
Want me to bring you back
an "ensaimada"?
What?
I'm going to lbiza tomorrow
to cover the electronic festival.
- I could get you an "ensaimada".
- Wait a second.
We're in the red, Dani.
- This is no good.
- I'm not getting you anything.
Relax, I'm DJ-ing next week.
- 'Bye.
- I'll pay back the money.
Shit! Anyone heard from Bruno?
Did he call here?
Weren't you having lunch
with your parents?
Yes, but we waited an hour
and he didn't turn up.
- It's weird.
- No, it's called being stood up.
You think your girl's mad at you?
No, but I bet she's worried.
It's her parents that'll be
fucking pissed off.
- Do you know them?
- Yeah.
Carla and I have been together
since we were 16
and shacked up for 3 years.
But they live in Sitges
and I hardly ever seen them.
- Her dad can't stand me.
- Why?
He'd rather Carla went out
with an architect or something.
- He's French.
- Fuck him.
The bad thing is
they're in Barcelona today.
- And they've taken over your place.
- Well, it's actually "their" flat.
Fuck.
If I were you,
I wouldn't go there tonight.
I've got to apologize in person.
Stop it, Mum,
you're worrying me even more.
Guess where I'm going tomorrow!
To lbiza, to cover the festival.
And to get away from you,
It's as if we're an item.
Chill out, it's all-expenses-paid.
If you leave home
and check in together,
probably on the plane
you'll be sitting... together.
Fuck no! Not lbiza!
We'll talk later, okay?
Hello?
Yeah, Bruno.
She's right here.
I'll put her on.
'Bye.
- What happened to you?
- You wouldn't believe me.
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
No, no. I feel bad that you
had to take the fallout alone.
Alright.
Yeah, yeah.
'Bye. Big kiss.
Everything okay?
I've got an amazing girlfriend.
She says not to go home tonight
to avoid a row with her parents.
Stay here if you like.
No, I've bothered you enough.
People crash here every day.
I am getting tired.
I don't know if it's the bump
or the spliff.
Here.
In case you want to change.
Thanks.
Fine, alright. See you later.
Your father.
He's tied up at the meeting.
We're not to wait up.
If I'd known that...
First he stands us up for dinner,
now he's not even coming.
He's working.
Bruno's the one who's got a nerve.
He lives here in our house,
and doesn't say hello
or even apologize.
Mum, he had an accident.
Yes, as if I believe that.
He just doesn't want to see us.
Don't start.
- What's that pill for?
- To sleep. I've got insomnia.
You? You sleep like a log!
Because I take the pill.
It's for depression.
You always struck me as...
melancholic.
He won't let it go.
That's good reflexes.
He's really cute.
Grab it, he'll burn himself.
What are you people doing here?
Daddy, she's naked.
Guys, guys, get up!
Let's call the police.
Rai! Rai!
Rai, c'mon. We've got to go.
- What's going on?
- The cops are coming.
Hey, wake up!
Shit, let's go!
Hey, let's go.
Hey, Rai, help me!
Maria, take her on you bike.
Go!
We gotta go, the cops are coming.
- What do I do?
- Take that.
Out the window!
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm getting the Metro.
Well, we say goodbye here.
I'd ask you home,
but you know how things are.
Relax.
I'll take a walk around.
When I get a mobile, I'll call you
and give you back the T-shirt.
It's a gift... but call me.
And get that cut seen to.
Hey, would you mind
changing neighbourhoods?
- What?
- Follow me.
Let's go.
We pay them the months we owe
or they throw us out.
- It's not my fault.
- I'm sick of telling people.
We publish a free college rag,
we're almost broke,
but he wants it all high-quality,
the printing, whatever.
Plus we buy tickets to lbiza,
the magazine goes belly up,
and I look like the bad guy.
Where are the cartridges
for the printer?
Marta's got them.
- Why do you want them?
- Why else? To print.
Yes, but is it for personal use?
Shit, it's for college.
I don't earn a cent here
and you tell me
I can't use the printer?
We've only got two cartridges left
and we won't get any more!
From now on, the money
comes out of our pockets.
They say we're stingy,
but you're not from here
and you're such a tightwad.
- People are living here. Let's go.
- Carla?
Let's go!
I'm at Adrian and Dani's place.
You bastard.
No, I haven't seen them.
They must've gone to lbiza.
Yeah, through the patio door,
the one they're always about to fix.
No, I'm with a friend.
Yes, the one who helped me.
He's flat-hunting, so I thought
he could stay here meanwhile.
Hold on.
Don't look at me like that.
What can I do?
Just give me one.
Who where you talking to?
Why'd you cover the phone again?
Yeah, I bet he's flirting
with you, as usual.
Don't get mad. I just wanted to know
if your parent's had gone.
Fine, Yeah, yeah. 'Bye.
Jealousy.
I don't think she's cheating on me.
What bugs me is that
she might fancy other guys.
Does that happen to you?
Yes.
But I put up with it.
Otherwise, what's love all about?
It's about sharing ideas...
wishes, experiences.
But it doesn't put limits
on your life.
Still less on the lives of others.
But if there are no limits,
you're not a real partner...
just another person.
The couple should find
their own limits.
Sticking to the typical rules
doesn't improve the relationship.
That's what I think.
In a couple you have to be
special for the other person.
That's something else.
You and I...
We just met...
and you're already special to me.
When couples hide things,
it's all over.
Your father knows I'm depressed,
I don't hide anything from him.
Mum, you should live your own life.
He does,
and without considering you.
He's just busy all the time.
Yes, with another woman.
The woman you're talking about
is his architect, that's all.
Why don't you separate?
And be left alone?
Mum, you're already alone.
That's not true.
Your father and I love each other.
What's up?
Marta said you were here
with your mother.
Let me see...
- It's sexy.
- Yeah.
Hello, Nuria.
Forgive me...
for yesterday.
Hello, Bruno.
- What happened to you?
- Mum, I told you!
I'm sorry. I fainted,
I lost my mobile...
No, please. Forgive "me".
I thought it was an excuse
not to see us.
I love seeing you.
- Where's Gerard?
- Busy.
What are you doing?
Wait, no.
Wait.
Wait, no.
Morning, babe.
Good morning.
You do me in two minutes,
and it's goodbye?
When you're in a hurry,
you do the same thing.
Where are you going?
To fix breakfast.
I want to study.
- I've got an exam next month.
- Next month!
Yes, my scholarship's at stake,
not like some people.
Stay.
One, two, three!
One, two, three!
One, two, three!
More focus!
One, two, three!
With a yell!
One, two, three!
One, two, three!
Focus!
Ready position!
Stance with feet out!
- Hi.
- How are you?
Carla really wants to meet you.
She's with a friend now,
so we'll hook up later.
I don't feel like going out.
No, that doesn't cut it.
Let's go!
Let's leave it right there, okay?
But you followed me
all over the island!
And on the beach? You turned up
with your thingy in the air.
- They said it was a nudist beach.
- Nudist...
- Hi.
- Hey, Bruno.
- How are you?
- Great.
- Hi.
- You must be Rai.
- How are you?
- I'm Dani.
And you're... Adrian.
Thanks for the place.
I'll get my stuff and go.
There's no need.
Stay as long as you like.
We can empty the junk room,
right, Adrian?
Yes. Why not?
Thanks a lot.
Is she serious?
No, we'd love to.
Okay, we'll talk later.
See you soon. Thanks.
Yes!
We're doing a piece
on Virginia Dalmau.
- Can I take shots of her?
- Sure!
They say she's got a temper...
I love her!
She's such a diva, such a queen.
Why the long face?
This may be our last article,
do you realize that?
We'll have to close before summer.
The boss of the film distributor
that asked us to do the report
on Dalmau's movie was my boss
on the last paper I worked for.
And he says...
he's interested in investing
in our magazine.
What?!
But only if he likes the article,
especially the photos,
so there's a lot at stake.
Are you sure your friend's coming?
Otherwise I'm ditching the high heels.
I know all the Journalism students.
Yeah? And you don't want to
do any of them again?
I'm the "mojito" king!
So, are you dressed to kill?
Yes, but don't worry,
you're not on my list.
Fine, and don't get your hopes up.
Hello.
Hello, Carla.
Rai?
- How are you doing?
- Good.
Nice to meet you.
- This is Maria.
- Nice to meet you.
- Carla, Bruno's girlfriend.
- Nice to meet you.
- Rai!
- Hey there!
- How are you doing?
- Great.
- How's your eyebrow?
- Fine.
- Bruno.
- Maria, you're still alive.
- This is Carla, my girlfriend.
- Yes, we've been introduced.
- Want to put your things away?
- Yes.
- Hey, how are you?
- Great.
I just fell in love.
Introduce him to me.
Hold on, they just got here.
I'll introduce you later.
- Like the place?
- Yeah.
He's coming, he's coming.
- For you.
- For me?
It's Berlin, I was dancing there
with a friend.
I don't know what to say.
Like it?
Of course! Thanks.
I saw some of your photos
in the magazine.
Most are just decoration.
Sometimes I put in
more personal ones.
You've got a special style.
I like it.
Your girlfriend's very cute.
You should watch out.
Yeah, so should you,
You're a bit wasted.
Not wasted enough.
Is she drunk, or what?
- Maria, are you okay?
- Yes.
Let's go home.
Shall we?
Rai's wicked.
Marta's crazy about him,
and so am I.
Oh, yeah?
Guys, we're going.
She's spinning out.
I'll take her on her bike.
Is she his girlfriend?
They did go out,
but now they're just friends.
Look.
You're getting off with Adrian!
Oh, fuck.
They forgot their helmets.
The helmets. Wait here.
Thanks.
I like Carla.
She's a fucking great girl.
It sucks that you have to go.
You can see the shape Maria's in.
We didn't get a chance
to hang out together.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I came to give you back
the T-shirt you lent me.
I gave it to you.
But if you don't want it...
I made some coffee.
How's Maria?
Not too good.
She takes too much shit.
I convinced her to go to
a country house her sister's got.
Come in.
No, I'm going. I'm in a hurry.
Listen, Rai...
- About yesterday...
- Don't worry.
It won't happen again.
Unless you want it to.
Yes, put the green one on him.
It's all under control.
It better be. You've no idea
how neurotic Virginia is,
and how bossy!
She's only missing a willy.
Yes! No, we'll wait.
That's right.
Thanks.
See you soon. 'Bye.
Virginia won't be here
for three hours or more.
Shit! Why's that?
She's a diva.
What did you expect?
I might go to the pool
and see Bruno.
I've been wanting to take
some photos of him swimming.
Go on.
Shall we have some coffee
and talk about the meeting?
Listen, just because we got off
the other day
doesn't mean we're an item.
Okay?
You're an idiot!
I wanted to get off with Rai,
but he split, I was horny...
Next time you're horny,
use your fingers.
Look at that guy swim.
Those arms!
His arms around you
must be... Olympic.
Look.
- We'll wait for him outside. Hurry!
- Relax.
While he's in the shower
we can enjoy the world of sports.
Did he go out some other way?
Hang on.
I'll see if he's still inside.
What's wrong?
They were together.
Together? Who?
Bruno and Rai...
in the shower.
But...
Don't tell anyone, please.
The photo session with Virginia!
Don't forget!
Yes.
No, I realize that.
No way, impossible.
Yes. I'm asking you, please...
Alright, alright.
Alright, alright.
Thanks. 'Bye.
What the fuck happened?
Virginia's agent says
the photographer stood her up.
Where's Carla?
I hope she's in the hospital.
Watch it.
We tried the hospital excuse
on Virginia
- and she didn't buy it.
- She tore strips off me.
The magazine depends on this job
and she can't even call!
What's her deal?
She should ask herself
if she really wants to stay with us.
No, we should ask ourselves
if we want her to stay.
She's going through
some tricky personal stuff.
- Oh, yeah? You don't say!
- Yes.
And it's pretty heavy.
But I can't tell you.
Are you a homosexual?
No, I'm not a homosexual.
Bruno, this is rough on me
but you have to accept it.
Carla, I like women.
I like you!
- Are you fooling me or yourself?
- No, I'm telling you the truth.
I love you.
Why didn't you tell me
if you love me so much?
Didn't you think about me?
About us?
I've put up with your fucking jealousy
all my life,
and now you cheat on me!
- Piss off!
- Fuck... I'm sorry.
- Don't touch me!
- Take it easy.
I didn't plan any of this.
But I couldn't help it either.
I don't know.
I thought about not seeing Rai,
but I felt this unbearable anxiety.
You sound like you're in love.
No, this Rai thing is different.
He's my friend.
I need to see him!
It's like a drug.
Is it sexual?
Yes, it's sexual.
Look, if I keep seeing him,
I'll get over it, and then...
Then what?
You fall for another guy?
I told you, I'm not interested
in other guys!
- How do you know?
- This Rai thing is different!
It's not just sexual.
You've fallen in love.
No, I'm in love with you.
I want to stay with you.
Then don't see him again.
If you love me,
don't see him anymore.
I promise.
- Hi.
- Hi.
This is too heavy.
It's fucking up my life,
and my head.
Carla's the most
important thing to me.
She's where I belong.
We can't see each other any more.
Okay.
Okay, take it easy.
I couldn't.
What?
I tried to, but I couldn't.
Get your things and go.
Fold you T-shirts right,
or they take up more space.
I know I have to go,
but I already miss you.
Where will you go?
What'll you do?
- Do you need money?
- No, no...
I just need one thing.
- Please hug me...
- No, no! Go!
Hello.
Couldn't keep your mouth shut?
I was sticking up for you.
Forgive me.
If you couldn't work,
you should've said so.
We would've worked it out.
What happened is very serious, Carla.
We work on the magazine
for the love of art,
and we do what we can to get by.
We had a great chance,
but it's gone.
I'll call the distributor.
I'll talk to Virginia somehow.
I'm sorry...
but don't turn your backs on me now.
Don't you leave me too.
No one's turning their back on you.
Where's Bruno? At your place?
No.
When we said we'd kicked Rai
out of the flat, he got mad and left.
- Where to?
- We don't know.
He won't answer his phone.
You should forget Bruno.
He's out of the closet now,
so there'll be no stopping him.
Give it time.
Come here.
My sister and her family
only come on some weekends.
Stay as long as you like.
This is beautiful, Maria.
Yeah, beautiful, and very boring.
That's before we got here.
What do you think?
It's the perfect place to study.
Even the phone's out of range.
Do you regret it?
And what'll you do here?
We're in this together, right?
And I'll keep Maria under control.
But you need to work.
I told you,
the gym gave me a week.
Then we'll see.
Besides, Barcelona's close by.
What's wrong?
I'm all mixed up.
About Carla and about you.
What I don't get is that
you didn't notice he was gay.
Mind you, he isn't camp at all.
We've always been great sexually.
And guys can't fake orgasms.
Then it's obvious: He's bisexual.
I really turn him on,
but if he needs to be with a guy
and I'm not a guy...?
Since you're so open,
let him have the occasional fling,
and that's that.
Are you making fun of me?
No, but you say you're so liberal...
and in the end,
you're like everybody,
you can't stand infidelity.
It's not the same thing!
Sleeping around is not the same
as being with the same guy.
So for you, his mistake was
sticking to the same guy.
All this isn't going to fit!
You brought too many clothes.
It's only a few days.
I'm going for a walk.
- I'll come with you.
- No, Rai.
I'd rather be alone.
I think this game
is slipping through your fingers.
What game?
I know you.
It's seduction than turns you on...
and by now
you must be tired of it.
- What if I'm not tired of it?
- That's worse.
You're miserable.
I don't recognize you.
I'm the same as ever.
I'm not so sure.
I've never seen you worried
about one of your lovers.
Sure, I only have to worry
about you, right?
I'm sorry, I'm busy!
- What do you want?
- To talk to you.
- Did something happen to Bruno?
- No, relax.
We're with Maria in the country.
- He doesn't know I came to see you.
- I've got nothing to say to you!
I think you do.
Just give me one minute.
Please.
Alright...
Shift your leg.
Does it hurt?
Here?
It starts here.
Leave me alone!
You and Bruno love each other.
- Why are you apart?
- What do you care?
Are you bored with him?
If I were, I wouldn't be here.
It hurts me to see him so down.
He misses you.
You're asking me to take him back?
Yes.
And you? Would you disappear?
We'd carry on as before.
If you hadn't seen us together,
would Bruno have seemed
any different to you?
Of course not.
So I'm not taking anything from you.
Think about it.
Hi.
You and I are free,
I believe in you and me,
Come back...
This isn't healthy, girl.
I'm taking you out tonight,
If I have to drag you by the hair!
I can't take any more.
Four days and not a trace
of that prick.
Forget him.
How? Every step I take
I find something of his.
His tracksuit! His books!
His travel card! His lD card!
It's like he's here but he's not!
He won't come back
or take his stuff away!
I'm going crazy!
If he hasn't come back for it,
he doesn't care about it.
So you shouldn't.
Let's throw all his stuff out!
- Where are the garbage bags?
- Don't go overboard.
How can I do that to him?
There's a new bar with great music.
I know one of the barmen.
He'll stand us a drink.
I don't need Bruno for anything.
The best thing
is a good clean-out.
Get away from negative stuff.
Don't get carried away by feelings.
Taxi!
I'm going home. Sorry.
- Are you sure?
- I feel like a quiet night.
But you have fun. Don't worry.
Have you seen the T-shirt
I wear around the house?
Wait up!
I just want to talk to you.
Wait!
Stop! Stop!
Stop, please, stop!
Why didn't you answer my message?
There was no signal.
I only got it two hours ago.
- I thought it was better I came.
- All your stuff's been taken away.
I threw it all out.
No, no, it's fine.
Everything?
Well, not everything.
Very well.
Alright.
'Bye.
It's just your dad,
the meeting's dragging on.
We're not to expect him for lunch.
Did you really think he was coming?
Don't start.
By the way, how is it with Bruno
after his little... fling?
Better than ever.
But are you sure
they're not seeing each other?
- I'm sure he is.
- What?!
It's part of our deal as a couple.
We're open people.
So he's still seeing that girl
and you don't mind.
It's not a girl, it's a boy.
And you're fine with that?
What's not fine is my father
has a thing going
with his architect
and you pretend you don't know.
It was a fleeting thing.
It's in the past.
He's been with this woman
for five years.
He comes to Barcelona to see her,
that's why he's not here!
- Everyone knows!
- Do you want us to separate?
Hello. First course is...
I want a whisky on the rocks.
Same here.
What, isn't it allowed?
Look at my face, I'm old enough.
I'm old now, but you're young.
Leave Bruno.
There are tons of terrific guys.
Why? I'm happy with him.
I feel good.
I don't believe you.
Where are you off to so early?
The gym.
I don't have class till midday.
- Why don't you go later?
- No...
I'd rather go now.
C'mon, don't be a bad girl.
We're going to the pool.
- I'll go get my stuff.
- No, Carla...
- I've got a karate class.
- With Rai?
Sure. He's the teacher.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I thought you'd get mad.
Whatever I do, you get mad.
What are you doing tonight?
Any plans?
I don't know.
I just got up and you ask me
what I'm doing tonight!
In case you were staying with Rai.
If I were, I'd call to tell you.
I don't spend every night with him!
This is crazy!
It's just to organize myself!
I might meet Marta
after the magazine closes up.
Do what you want!
Stop fucking hovering
around me all the time!
Shit. I'm sorry.
C'mon, c'mon...
We're so tied together,
we've become too dependent.
That's not good.
I need you.
I don't need you.
- I'm with you because I want to be.
- You didn't talk like that before.
'Cause I'd never thought about it.
I feel the same way about you.
No, no...
It's much stronger.
I love you even more.
Because you try to
accept me the way I am.
It's not easy.
I'll be back tonight.
If you're not meeting anyone
after work, I'll be here.
'Bye.
We're been waiting an hour!
What if we just go?
No way.
Maybe you think it's easy
to get time with Virginia Dalmau.
I'm losing the urge to apologize.
Do you want the magazine to fold?
You'll kneel if you have to!
What do I say to her?
The truth. What happened.
Sure, the shower thing?
I'm sure she'll understand.
But don't tell her you let them
shower together now,
or she'll laugh her head off.
If you love someone,
you don't inhibit or shackle them.
Besides, if he's seeing Rai,
Bruno tells me.
Deep down you're like your mother:
Resigned to it.
I accept this situation
because I want to!
I'm free!
My father ignores my mother.
And me!
Bruno doesn't ignore me.
He loves me!
Why wouldn't he?
With all this understanding?
You know what I think?
When someone's that open,
they're not in love.
But it's comfortable to have
company, sex...
- I'm fine with it.
- Yes, you are...
and he is even more.
But you don't look fine.
If you want to kid yourself,
It's up to you.
You're kidding yourself with this
I-don't-want-a-partner stuff,
and the fact is you can't get one!
What's that?
You act all slutty
because you refuse to admit
that you're desperately
looking for someone!
And you end up shagging Adrian,
who you think is an idiot!
A bit over the top, aren't you?
Thanks for coming.
I'm so sorry for what I said.
It may be true,
but you're very cruel, girl.
I've got feelings too, you know?
Forgive me.
I'm not a wall you throws rocks at
and they bounce off.
I feel terrible
and I'm taking it out on you.
I've got problems too,
but I solve them on my own
and I don't blame anyone.
You're so sensitive,
I can't say anything to you.
You can sleep at my place,
but as you know,
it's a family environment.
You know what?
We're got a photo
and interview session with Virginia.
What? Fucking brilliant!
Lighten up, girl.
Dani and Adrian are coming.
Wait till we tell them!
Why'd you ask them to come?
We were already meeting up.
I had to let off steam with someone.
What did you tell them?
They knew Bruno and Rai
were still together.
Dani saw them and...
I explained the situation.
I'm going to the bathroom,
my stomach's upset.
If you'd only seen it...
They looked so happy...
When you left me there...
I swear to you...
Where have you been?
Around.
- Who were you with?
- You're asking me for explanations?
No, no. You always tell me,
but if you don't want to...
I was with someone who suggested
I sleep at their place.
But I didn't want to.
Because you didn't fancy them?
Hello, Marta.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She's right here.
You left your bag
and camera... in the bar.
Yes, don't worry.
I didn't feel like talking.
See you tomorrow. Big kiss.
I'm pathetic, aren't I?
Sometimes I get the feeling
everyone's laughing at me.
Especially you.
You're not pathetic.
You're the most
wonderful person I know.
And I'm so lucky you're with me.
Do you really think so?
What are those shelves?
Surprise! Didn't you need some?
Where'd you get them from?
The gym,
they were throwing them out.
I don't want them.
Nor do I want Rai coming here.
This is our place,
my parents' place!
- It was a real pleasure.
- Thank you.
Yeah.
At first I was a bit intimidated,
but in the end we connected.
I'm so happy.
Thanks, Mum.
I'm going. Big kiss.
What are you doing here?
I came to apologize,
for being at your place
when you weren't there...
to put up the shelves.
We're not here to discuss our lives,
we're working.
Sorry, They said you'd finished.
Can I help in any way?
You've got a volunteer
to help tidy up.
See you tomorrow.
See you.
Why do you tell him
what we talk about?
I only told him you got mad
about the shelves
and didn't want him
to come here.
- What else?
- Nothing.
It's hard not to talk about you.
I live here, with you.
I don't want you talking
about me again, alright?
Fine, as you wish.
I think this is yours.
Thanks.
May I?
Bruno!
How are you, handsome?
What are you doing here?
I came to take you both to lunch.
I'm buying.
I'd rather study some more.
Then we'll wait.
It's early.
We should forget lunch?
Shall you and I go?
What?
If Bruno wants to study,
let him study.
Tell him to go away.
She doesn't feel like it either.
Right?
Yes.
I do feel like it.
Shall we go?
Then let's go.
No, you stay here and study.
Don't think for one moment
we're going to be friends, okay?
I'm just doing it to annoy Bruno
and to set some things straight.
Fine. I'll get the food.
I said I was buying.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Where's Pau?
- Doing exams.
Hello.
You must be used to this stuff,
but I don't like it at all.
You'll love it.
It's all delicious here.
Let's go.
- See you.
- See you.
Hey! Hey! You forgot something.
Yes, to pay...
No, not that.
She thinks I'm shoplifting.
Tell her I'm a good guy.
You're giving this to us?
On the condition
that you eat it today.
Why?
Because it expires tomorrow.
Or do you think these people
like losing money?
You bastard.
I might not let you have anything.
- You know him?
- I'm karate teacher to his son.
And everything we took
expires tomorrow.
Jackpot! You've won...
a jar of foie-gras.
Are you going to tell me
where we're going?
That's them.
Look at him, the missing piece.
C'mon, Rai!
This is Carla.
- Go, Rai!
- Go for it!
It's a bit risky, isn't it?
You could kill yourself.
If you don't take risks in life,
you're already dead.
How about that food?
- Ham?
- Yeah.
How did you get into dancing?
As kids we'd meet here
and imitate videos we saw on TV.
I used to imitate Madonna.
- Did you live here?
- I'm from Galicia.
But when I was 11 my dad died,
so my mum and I came to Barcelona.
So this is your neighbourhood?
Well, it's the place where
I spent the most time.
- We left here later.
- Where to?
Back to Vigo for a while,
we were in Hendaya, Santander,
wherever she got work.
Where's your mother?
She lives in Cadiz
with her new boyfriend.
When I come here and see
my old friends, I feel good.
Your breakdancing is great.
If you wanted to...
Breakdancers live to dance.
I can't get into just one thing.
Just in case I fail.
I'd rather nibble everything.
At boarding school
I got involved with a guy.
But when I was outside,
I'd score with girls.
Did you feel homosexual
or heterosexual?
I didn't sweat about it.
It was all sexual.
It seemed normal to you.
Normal?
Yeah.
Until I got beaten up.
I was 16.
And you signed up for karate.
I like reaching the limit
of my energy,
until I can't move a finger
or think about anything.
It's a kind of sweet death.
Hasn't anything like that
ever happened to you?
Yes.
But I was totally high.
The high is always here.
With some people
it's easier to find.
Thanks for walking me home.
You're welcome.
Hey!
Now we're set things straight,
don't think we're going to be friends.
It was just to annoy Bruno.
You're angry.
No, I'm studying.
What are laughing at?
Nothing.
Did you have a good time?
Do you forgive me?
When you're angry
you get really aggressive.
What did you do?
Do I ask you what you do
when you're with him?
They're letting me crash here
in exchange for
doing the maintenance.
Come right in.
It's pathetic,
She acts all super-sexy,
at her age.
That was intense,
Rai turning up all of a sudden.
He and Carla are good friends now.
What's that?
Have you chosen the photos
we're going to send?
You decide, I don't mind.
What's all this?
What?
- Are you officially on together?
- We have been for ten days.
Why didn't you tell me?
'Cause you've been busy lately.
You prefer your boyfriend's lover
to your best friend now.
Bruno has no idea how I feel.
I doubt he'd be so understanding
in my place.
- Run the test on him.
- What test?
What do I do?
Find a lover?
You must fancy someone.
We're closed.
- Hi.
- Hi.
It suddenly occurred to me
to come and see you,
but if you're heading out, I'll go.
No, I'm just tidying up.
- Come in.
- Okay.
I'm in your bedroom.
I was going to lie down and read.
Will you help me make the bed?
Okay.
Sit down.
This must be great for your back.
Do you ever get a fright at night
from your own reflection?
It's got its pluses.
It's as if someone just like you
is here, but it's not you...
and you can spy on what he does.
Hello!
I'm having dinner.
Since you were so late...
Did you meet for drinks?
No.
Were you working late?
Working, no... shagging.
With whom?
Who else?
No, just kidding.
I'm going to bed.
There's steak in the fridge.
- Who is it?
- Maria.
Carla. We're at the pool.
No, I haven't told him.
It's hard for me too.
Yes, I know.
I know we have to tell him.
Okay.
I'll call you. Big kiss.
How about that Virginia,
after all that complaining...
Give me some.
- Here, Carla.
- What are we celebrating?
They're buying us!
And they love the photos!
We're meeting bosses of
the distributor this afternoon
to sign the deal!
That's great.
Something wrong?
No. Why?
We've dreamt of this
for a long time,
and now we've done it.
How about some enthusiasm?
I'm happy, really.
It's great.
I'm going to the bathroom.
What's wrong?
- You've been weird for days.
- I'm involved with Rai.
What?!
I'm involved with Rai.
How did Bruno take it?
I don't dare tell him.
But are you still in love
with Bruno or not?
Yes, I'm in love with Bruno,
but Rai gets me so hot!
What does Rai say about it?
We've decided not to
see each other for now.
- You have to tell Bruno.
- I'm afraid he'll leave me.
If he really loves you
he'll accept it, like you did.
- And if he doesn't?
- Then he's not worth it.
Yeah, I'm involved with Rai!
So what?!
Rai, I'm starting to worry.
Why won't you pick up?
They found out at the magazine.
- Can I come in?
- Yes!
Do you want to go to the movies
or for a walk?
Marta called,
I have to rush to the magazine.
You're always out late
or busy at night.
They exploit you.
Yeah, but it's worth it.
I've got to run.
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.
Stop, stop, stop.
Weren't you going to the magazine?
Yes, but I realized I left my folder
and photos here the other night,
and I need them.
What about you?
You get in so late these days,
I thought I'd visit Rai,
though he's been busy lately too.
Shall we go?
Let's go, yeah.
Yes?
- Hello.
- Hello.
Bruno and I met
at the door by chance.
I was coming for some photos.
- Do you want a drink?
- No.
I'll be right back.
- I'll go with you.
- Me too.
Going somewhere?
I'm going to the country
for a while with Maria.
- Did something happen to her?
- No, she's fine.
I'm the one who
needs to get away.
I'm having a drink.
- I'll help you.
- No, I'll help him.
Rai, what's up?
Why are you leaving?
You can't do this to me.
Can I get the lemon?
Then I'll stay with you tonight.
I'll have a drink too.
Weren't you going?
If Rai's leaving,
we have to give him a send-off.
There's a bottle of gin.
Can you get it?
You can't go!
Bruno will be down at any moment.
Why not ask him to go out
and buy something
so you can tell me why
you're going without a goodbye?
- Carla, please.
- You're making a detergent cocktail!
I don't know what I'm doing!
Rum!
There's no gin left.
- What's wrong?
- I'm hot.
I've been training,
I need some air.
You haven't got a fever?
Let me past!
A "mojito" would be great.
Will you make it?
This can't go on, Carla.
I don't want to deceive anyone.
Neither do I.
Let's tell him,
It's the best thing.
- The best thing is for me to go.
- No...
Here's the Mojito King with...
Just listen to me!
Open up. Please.
I wanted you to feel what I felt.
For you to know
how much it hurts.
But I fell for Rai.
Isn't that what happened to you?
It doesn't change
the way I feel about you.
I love you,
and the main thing
is that we're all together.
Open up, Please.
Goodbye, Bruno.
It's great to see you.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Come in.
You've got a little surprise.
Can we talk?
Forgive me.
I've been a fool.
I don't know if it was
selfishness or stupidity.
I feel so ashamed.
After you and Rai...
And I wanted you to be friends.
But we're more than friends,
you saw that.
Do you still want to be with me?
More than ever.
But I don't want Rai to vanish
from my life either.
- He's important too.
- And to me.
I never want us to part.
Things are getting
more complicated than usual.
What do you mean?
You can't resist the temtation
to seduce everyone.
And now the ultimate challenge:
A couple.
You're jealous.
I love you,
but I'm not in love with you.
Right.
And Bruno?
Carla?
Who?
Both of them.
I love them.
Enough to get out of the way
and leave them alone.
Every time you get
too hooked on somebody,
you travel, take a lover...
and run away.
The only one running away
from it all is you.
Stop fooling yourself, Rai.
You're afraid of suffering,
so you're scared of commitment.
And even more so
when it's not one... but two.
Have I told you
how beautiful are you?
I love your body.
I'll never get tired of it.
- Where's Rai?
- He's gone.
To Barcelona.
I just left him on the road
thumbing a lift.
- To Barcelona?
- Sure. Get in.
Look, he's there!
- Rai!
- Rai!
Wait!
Rai!
Rai!
Wait!
Why'd you go without a goodbye?
I don't like goodbyes.
Get out, come to lunch! Please!
Life alone isn't easy,
with two it's complicated,
and with three, impossible!
- What?!
- I'll miss you both.
- What?!
- I'll never forget you!
- Rai, stay with us!
- Goodbye.
If you don't take a risk,
you're dead!
- Stop.
- What?
Stop, please.
Wait for me!
Stop! Stop!
No!
Bruno! Carla!
Bruno! Carla!
Bruno!
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
Fuck...
Where's Carla?
Where is she?
Carla!
Turn her over.
Are you alright?
Take her arm.
Careful, careful.
Not your helmet. Careful!
You're okay.
You can't get rid of us now.
Come on.
