Today marks a bleak
anniversary for our planet.
Three years ago,
the first case
of a global plant virus
was recorded,
which started to ravage
most of our ecosystems.
The world's leading
research laboratories
have been trying to find a way
to stop this deadly pathogen,
but so far their efforts
have been unsuccessful.
The latest research shows
that people who consume food
infected with the virus
develop severe
autoimmune diseases.
In addition,
the loss of plant life
has contributed
to the concentration of oxygen
in the atmosphere
to decrease to 18%,
the lowest on record.
The rapidly disappearing forests
cannot recycle
enough carbon dioxide
to maintain this level
for much longer.
These atmospheric
changes have caused
an increase in natural disasters
around the globe.
As oxygen levels
drop below 10%,
people will begin to suffocate.
Our beautiful planet
Earth is doomed.
But humanity still
has a chance of survival.
And their best hope
is Project Gemini,
developed by Dr. Steven Ross.
The project centers
around an archeological find
discovered eight years ago
by a group of palaeontologists
who found two unique objects
of extraterrestrial origin.
The artefacts were estimated
to be more than
4 billion years old.
Steven Hawking once said
that if humans are
to survive long-term,
we must find a way
to get off planet Earth.
He was optimistic
about our chances,
and in fact,
it turns out he was right.
These unique devices
that we found
appeared on Earth
before life itself.
We don't know what
mysterious stellar wisdom
created them and left them here,
but we received this gift
on the brink of extinction.
We managed to recreate
the super-tough materials
that the Sphere
and the Engine are made of.
And we precisely copied
both of the devices.
Now, each of them
has an identical twin.
The warp engine
for interstellar flights
has allowed us to find a planet
more or less suitable
for terraforming.
The unmanned vehicle
completed a "jump"
to the solar system TESS
and returned
with information and samples
that confirmed our theories.
And this device, this sphere
is for creating life.
After years of research,
we discovered
a way to control
the Sphere and the Engine.
These devices have
their own unique language.
We decoded dozens of commands,
each of which corresponds
to a certain pattern.
This pattern gave
the initial command
that the Sphere
began to carry out
more than
four billion years ago.
The Sphere uses chemical
elements from the environment
and creates a true miracle...
Life!
Now we know life on Earth
was created by this machine.
The Sphere is
our starting point.
Let me introduce you to our team
of leading research scientists.
Our team consists of...
Dr. Peter Lehmann,
the specialist
in extraterrestrial warp engine.
Dr, Leona Redwood,
the terraforming
program builder.
Today we're joined
by military-trained pilots,
headed by Major Ryan Connor.
We are departing
for the solar system TESS,
several hundred light-years
from here.
We will bring the Sphere...
to a planet that has
the right conditions.
And we will create...
Earth 2.0...
a new home for humanity.
What do you think, Peter?
Whoever created this,
where are they now?
Not enough data to say.
And I, don't really like
speculating about
stuff like this.
This isn't about speculation.
It's a theory.
Maybe it was
a lost civilization.
We know from experience
how highly-developed
civilizations are good
at self-destruction.
Who knows?
Yeah.
Well,
another giant leap
for humanity, eh, guys?
Only this time, literally.
First time in history...
Just as long
as something more
than a bunch of atoms
makes it to the destination.
Still counts.
Say it. First time in history.
Attention.
And prepare for a jump.
All systems are ready.
Coordinates set.
Warpdrive set at maximum power.
Ready.
Engage.
Whoa...
Critical error.
Critical error.
Critical error.
Whoa, whoa...
Critical error.
Whoa, whoa...
Wow.
Is this TESS?
Richard, did we complete
the maneuver?
Yes, we did.
The star maps, they...
don't match up.
It's not TESS.
What coordinates did you put in?
Are you sure
they were operational?
Of course, sir.
Did you check the engine?
Everything was done
according to protocol.
If everything was done
to protocol,
we'd be in TESS right now.
The mission failed, Peter.
There is no hope for Earth now.
Permission to check the engine.
No.
You're relieved of your duties.
Stay in your bunk
until I say otherwise.
Yes, sir.
What's this?
In physics,
there is an equation...
the Dirac equation.
When two particles
come into contact,
they become bound forever.
They continue to "feel"
one another,
even if they are...
lightyears apart.
It's called
quantum entanglement.
That's physics for you?
Not just physics.
Try to set the jump trajectory.
Maybe it'll help us
figure out where we are.
No, Steve.
Our trajectory's not clear.
The data doesn't make
any sense at all.
Look, we entered
the fourth dimension,
but it's almost as
if we moved along
the coordinate axis
that we can't access.
And then, we jumped back
into three-dimensional space.
But where?
Is there anything around us
that can help us
figure out our location?
No.
No landmarks.
Nothing even remotely familiar.
We have no point to set
a return jump.
So that means that
until we figure out where
we are, we can't get back.
No.
Repair Airlock is open.
What's that?
The repair airlock of the engine
compartment was opened.
Why? Who's there?
Repair Airlock,
this is the captain calling.
Airlock, report.
Unidentified object approaching.
Unidentified object approaching.
Unidentified object approaching.
Unidentified object approaching.
Unidentified object approaching.
Shit!
I can't believe it.
Calm down, Leona.
We gotta keep our cool
if we wanna survive.
We're already
a man down.
Peter ignored Steve's orders,
went to the engine
compartment...
realized what he'd done,
and that...
That was the end.
Peter wouldn't have!
I knew him.
I worked with him
for eight years.
He couldn't have
given up so easily!
Leona, enough!
How can you defend him?
Now we have to deal with
the results of his mistakes.
Do his work for him.
One person put
multiple lives in danger.
He almost destroyed humanity's
only chance of survival,
that's who you should
be crying for!
After Rita died,
I didn't wanna live anymore.
But then I thought,
instead of ending it all,
I could make it mean
something.
So I decided to devote myself
to the mission.
But now it turns out...
that...
I'm less useful here
than on Earth.
David.
Everything
will be alright.
We'll find a way out of this.
The future of Earth
depends on our mission.
Giving up is not an option.
We need to establish what part
of the universe we're in.
Richard, do you have anything?
Not yet.
I'm tracking
the movement trajectories
of the nearest
stars and planets.
I'll try to calculate
our position from there.
David.
What about that planet?
Any data on the probe?
Just loaded.
Great.
The surface of the planet
is made of volcanic rock.
There's no biosphere.
There is an atmosphere,
but without oxygen.
Average temperature is
16 degrees Celsius.
The outside environment
isn't aggressive.
All we'll need are
breathing masks.
It's perfect.
If I could choose between
TESS and this planet,
I'd go here.
Did you realize
how lucky we are?
What was the likelihood
of winding up
near a planet
that's perfect for the Sphere?
What if this isn't an accident?
What if we were
brought here on purpose?
By whom?
The same thing
that left us the Sphere.
Ryan, get ready to disembark.
What do you mean?
We can complete our mission
on this planet.
But we haven't examined it.
But this is our chance.
If we launch the Sphere
on this planet,
we'll have enough time
to understand where we are.
Then other ships
can repeat our jump.
Richard.
Prepare the lander
to go down onto the planet.
But it's a young planet,
the atmosphere is unstable.
And we don't know
anything about it.
It might not be safe
to make a surface landing.
I agree. You are recklessly
risking the safety of the crew.
And I'm against it.
Thankfully, I'm the one
who makes the final decisions.
No, Steve. It's too early
for decisions like these.
I said, we are landing.
Richard,
show me the landing area.
You'll land here, in the valley.
Weather conditions
for descent are optimal.
We're ready.
Initiate undocking procedure.
Undocking sequence initiated.
Engines activated.
Height is 30,000 meters.
Coming down.
A storm front is
heading your way.
It formed a few minutes ago.
I couldn't have predicted it.
Winds are up to
40 meters per second!
So hold on.
Activating braking thrusters.
What the hell was that?
What's going on?
It's the wind.
The storm is quite agressive!
The rate of descent is twice
as high as the landing speed.
We're falling!
We're gonna crash
on the surface!
I can double the thrust.
It'll slow your fall.
If we do that,
we'll use up all the fuel
for the return flight!
If we don't,
we will die.
The temperature is too extreme.
Your hull is melting.
Damn it!
Release the first tank!
I'll try to slow you down
aerodynamically.
I hope the hull holds up.
Hold on tight.
We're coming in hot!
Brace for impact!
Amy?
Amy,
where did you fly off to?
I need you.
I got you something.
What's this?
We've been together for a year.
You know, the Sphere
means a lot to me,
but not as much as you do.
Obviously,
I know you two don't get along.
So I thought of creating
something to connect you both.
It's made out of the old Sphere.
There was a fragment
that really stood out.
It's so beautiful.
Thank you.
I thought it would be symbolic.
The Sphere is our salvation,
and you are mine.
Let's go home.
The sprinklers are about
to start spraying.
Let's stay...
for a while.
What's the status
of the lander?
No critical damage.
But it's almost out of fuel.
Now we can't get back
to the ship. We're stuck here.
Why go back to the ship?
Our plan was to come back
in four years,
and now our main task
is to install and launch
the Sphere.
We're continuing the program.
But we can't carry it out now.
We strayed too far away
from the landing site,
into the mountains.
That means
there should be caves here.
But it's impossible
to deploy domes
on this terrain.
We'll manage without domes.
A deep-enough cave
will provide the right amount
of protection for the Sphere.
There. This cave looks suitable.
It's big enough
and easy to access.
Leona, you get the data
on seismic activity.
David, adjust the program.
Everyone else,
check the equipment.
Get to work, people.
What are you waiting for?
Conditions
on this planet
are even better
than we expected.
Other ships
will arrive here soon.
A new history of mankind
begins here at this very minute.
We did it.
I can't believe it!
Peter would be so happy.
He worked so hard for this.
Captain,
you need to see this.
He should be here.
Okay, attention, team!
We're returning to base.
Move out.
David,
do you have any data?
Not yet.
Dr. Ross,
martial law is in effect
in this station.
What?
Why?
We have new information.
Richard?
Starting playback.
This is Dr. Peter Lehmann.
Against all orders,
I will personally
conduct an engine inspection.
I am now recording
all of my actions
so I'm not accused of
tampering with the results.
The security cameras
are switched off
so that I'm not interrupted.
I'm not gonna be the scapegoat.
I'm gonna prove
that I made no mistake.
What was that?
Some kind of life form?
Was that what killed Peter?
I watched all of
the recordings from the cameras.
It shows up by the Sphere
for the first time
right after we left Earth.
That thing crawled out
of the Sphere?
Straight out of the story
of the Trojan horse.
And that Trojan
climbed right into the engine
just before the jump.
So maybe
it caused the failure?
Richard.
If that Trojan is still
on the ship,
you're in danger.
No. It went down with you...
into the Sphere.
We can track its position.
It causes interference
in the electromagnetic field.
Here's the video
from the cameras
right before the landing.
I've got the first data
from the cave.
Something's strange, Steve.
Levels of CO2 and oxidation
inside the Sphere are rising,
but there aren't any biomarkers.
What? Could it be a malfunction?
No,
it's working at full capacity.
Just on a different program
than the one we uploaded.
It's... doing something else.
Regroup.
We're going back to the Sphere.
We need to adjust the settings.
Nobody's going anywhere, Steve!
We'll adjust
the settings later...
after we deal with the threat.
But Steve is the head
of the project.
He calls the shots.
Not anymore!
Now it's a question
of the crew's survival.
Steve, I'm taking command,
you're being relieved.
You can't do that.
The future of mankind
depends on this mission.
Only Dr. Ross can carry it out.
Are you sure that Dr. Ross
is giving us all the information
about what this Sphere
actually is?
What are you
talking about?
Richard, show the video
from the cave.
Steve saw the anomaly...
and didn't say anything
to anyone,
risking the lives
of the entire crew.
Where did it come from?
Right from the Sphere...
which, as it turns out,
we know too little about.
What if it's an incubator
for those monsters?
I didn't hide a single
confirmed fact
about the Sphere from you.
And there was no sense
in discussing anomalies.
If we had known
about these anomalies,
we would have treated
the Sphere differently,
and Peter would be alive
right now.
David, I'm sorry
I couldn't make it.
It's okay.
I understand how busy you are.
Yes, we don't have
much time to spare.
Why are you here?
The doctor says I'm fine.
Gave me a clean bill of health.
So I'm ready to join everyone
for the pre-launch.
What?
I mean, you...
You're actually planning to fly?
You're the one who made me
a member of the crew.
But that was... before.
Before Rita died?
So what?
I'm telling you,
the psychologist
has confirmed I'm okay.
But to lose a daughter...
David, I'm terribly sorry.
I understand you want
to get back to work,
but this is not the best way.
Right now you need
time to grieve.
Steve, I'm not flying
to forget my daughter.
She'll always be a part of me.
I know the Sphere
as well as you do,
and you'll need me there.
David, listen.
All I'm doing is
looking out for you.
What?
You're crossing my name off?
After all we've done,
you're gonna leave me
on the sidelines?
I can help you
to change the future.
Don't take that away from me.
What?
We can't leave it like that.
We have to go back to the cave
and restore the settings.
But Ryan gave orders...
Just you and me.
We'll go out quietly.
Whatever killed Peter
is still in there.
The Trojan is 30 kilometers away
from the cave right now.
That means,
if it decides to come back,
we'll have at least
half an hour to get out.
- What about Ryan?
- Ryan's too careful!
He's wasting time!
Lost days are lost lives.
When Rita was dying,
you slowly died with her.
I saw what that was like.
Now imagine
that an entire planet
is dying the exact same way,
slowly, irreversibly,
from the same virus.
What the hell is this?
What's going on?
The Sphere did this.
You think
it was a malfunction?
Not just a malfunction.
The Sphere is creating
an alien life form.
And incredibly quickly...
Faster than it created
life on Earth!
We shouldn't touch it.
We need to discuss this
with everybody,
We need to set a plan of action.
Someone readjusted
the settings on the Sphere.
The Trojans are getting closer.
We gotta leave!
Just a minute!
Can't you hear me?
There's no point in risking
our lives! Let's go!
Get away from me, damn it!
Have you lost your mind?
It's over. The mission is over!
Deal with it!
The Sphere is hostile!
Put the gun down, David.
Put it down!
You wanna die because
of this piece of shit?
Too late.
It's already here.
Airlock closed.
Pressurization complete.
You're a psycho, Steve!
Because of you,
we both almost died!
This is not about us.
We have to complete the mission.
If you had damaged the Sphere,
all of this would have
been for nothing!
Then you should have shot me!
Why didn't you?
If you threaten the mission
one more time,
I will.
Steve, what the hell
are you doing?
Where were you?
Why did you leave the lander
against my orders?
We did what we had to.
You no longer have the right
to make decisions.
I make the decisions
I find necessary.
Or what, what are you gonna do?
Use force?
Then go ahead!
Well, come on!
Module integrity
compromised.
What did you do?
Module integrity compromised.
Module integrity compromised.
Shh... quiet, sweetie.
You're so close
I'm losing my head.
What is that?
The Trojan's in the lander.
Got a hole in low deck,
and everything covered
in this shit!
So what do we do now?
Quietly and slowly...
let's go.
It's hard to breathe.
Get back.
What?
Why?
It's here.
Run!
What happened? Are you okay?
The Trojan...
The Trojan's in the laboratory!
Do you realize what you've done?
You brought it
down here with you!
Can it get in here?
We don't know.
It damaged the generator,
and the cameras aren't working.
We lost contact
with the ship so...
we have no video from space!
Here's the last video
saved on the system.
It was looking for a weak spot
in the hull.
It got in through
the cooling system,
where the steel is the thinnest.
So this thing is smart,
it can think?
Whether it can think or not,
if we smoke it out
and weld the hole shut,
it can't crawl back in.
But how?
How can we smoke it out?
We can't even see where it is!
We have to restore the security
cameras and communications.
The Trojan damaged
the main generator,
but the life support system
is working.
That means,
the backup generator is fine.
We can connect the network
and cameras to it.
We will have to make our way
blind to the fusebox
with no idea
where that bastard is.
It's too risky.
It's all my fault.
So I'll go.
I'll watch your six.
Steve,
you need to get
out of there, now!
Are you hurt?
How's the signal
and the cameras?
All there. Back online.
Damn it.
It's transmitting an EMP field
stronger than the Sphere.
The elecronics next to it
are going crazy.
So what now?
Have you ever seen a raging bull
running after the crowds
down a narrow passage
just before the bullfight?
The bull wants
to catch the runners,
but it ends up in the arena
with the matador.
The Trojan is the bull.
It also wants to catch us.
We have a chance to lead it
wherever we want
like outside the lander.
It's a huge risk for everyone,
but it's all worth it.
The lander has two airlocks,
the central one,
and the one in the lab.
I'll be outside,
in front of the open
central hatch.
I'll be the main decoy.
The Trojan will chase me
along the corridors.
Once we get outside,
you shut the engines
to the airlock behind it.
Understood?
But in order
to do all that,
we need to get to the airlocks,
and that's where the Trojan is.
We can isolate it
in the main corridor here.
The inner doors
won't hold out long,
but should buy us some time.
I'll lure him into
the inter-hatch space
and lock him in there.
After the Trojan
is blocked,
each one of us will report
to a specific location.
David,
you and I will open
the air hatch in the labs.
You'll wait for me there,
while I go outside to be
the bait for the Trojan.
But in order for the Trojan
to see me and come out,
both sides of the airlock...
have to be open
outside and inside.
That's why, Leona, we'll
manually open the airlock...
and hide right here,
in the technical bay.
When the Trojan
comes after me,
it'll run over here,
past the engine
steering nozzles.
There should be some fuel left.
And if we turn the engine
at the right moment,
we won't just smoke it out.
We'll roast it.
Get outta here,
you ugly bastard!
Hurry! It won't
hold up much longer!
Don't panic!
Release the Trojan.
Hide in the tech bay.
You can do it.
I'm turning on
the engine.
Shit, it's not working!
The Trojan is messing
with the system!
Steve, run!
The engine's on.
Leona, get out!
Get out!
Hurry up!
Ryan, the airlock!
Shut the airlock!
Shit!
Rest in peace, Frank.
A part of its tentacle
was cut off by the door,
and it returned to the cave.
Pressurization complete.
Oxygen levels
returning to normal.
It won't get back in here.
But the Sphere
is under its control.
Not for long.
Amy.
What is it?
It's the virus.
It's already in our home,
literally.
You shouldn't go
on this mission.
Amy, what are you talking about?
We discussed everything.
You've done enough.
This isn't your mission.
Excuse me?
You're not even an astronaut!
You want me...
to walk out a week
before the launch?
What's gotten into you?
We're going to have a baby.
Why?
Just stay.
We'll work on the vaccine,
I found a promising pathway.
The mission will create
a new Earth,
but we could save this one.
This is my blueprint
for the vaccine.
Please go over it.
I'm really happy.
But it's such poor timing.
I won't get to see him grow up.
Steve...
I'm begging you, please,
stay with me.
- Stay with us.
- I can't.
I have to be there. I have to.
You've done everything
you could!
We can develop the vaccine now.
I think I'm onto something.
I need to save the Earth.
We have to study
this creature
so we can understand
what you're infected with.
My guess, it's a biorobot.
These are the same materials
the Sphere is made of.
And they also change
their properties
when they come into contact
with water.
We studied it,
never understanding that
one of its functions...
was to create a Trojan.
Maybe they are much
more advanced than we are.
And better.
David, listen.
Tell me what you found.
The bacteria
that infected you...
have an unusually powerful
defense mechanism.
I've studied them,
figured out how they work.
This is what we spent
all those years searching for.
Your blood holds the key
to the vaccine against the virus
that's been destroying
life on Earth.
It doesn't change anything.
Don't you understand?
We can save the world,
and it's all because of you.
You are the real hero.
I'll administer
some painkillers.
You'll feel better.
Here goes nothing.
W-What was that?
David...
It's a transponder.
We can see the connections
of the Sphere.
This is their way
of colonizing planets.
How's it going?
It's a biorobot.
We have to find a way
to destroy it...
and restore the settings
in the Sphere.
No, Steve.
Too many people have died
because of you already.
Wait.
What did you do?
Did you lock me in?
You are under arrest, Steve.
Ryan,
we have to work together...
for Peter and Frank and Leona.
- Otherwise, they'll die in vain.
- Cut it out, Steve!
People are expendable to you.
Ryan!
Ryan! Ryan!
He's right.
It was never about
the salvation of humanity
that was most important to you,
Steve.
You always want
to play the hero.
I know
you just want to win,
and you don't care
about other people's lives.
Amy, talk to me.
I read your proposal.
It looks truly promising.
A real breakthrough.
A chance to create the vaccine,
finally the real one.
But I do need to go...
for our sake.
I don't know
what I'll do without you,
but I promise...
I'll come back.
I need you.
Both of you.
Tell him...
or her...
that Daddy...
like a god, is out
creating the new Earth.
You keep saying
you're doing this
to save everyone.
But who is everyone?
You don't see people around you.
All you care about is
you and your project.
Why even bother?
To be hailed as savior?
Is that it?
To save our future.
I wonder what it is
you're really trying to save.
Richard,
you modeled the trajectories
of the nearest stars.
That didn't give us anything.
What do you think
you'll find there?
You said that
when we made the jump,
we moved along a coordinate axis
that was inaccessible to us.
And what if that axis
wasn't spatial?
Show us how
those stars will look
accounting the expansion
of the universe
over four billion years.
Yes, recalculating.
We didn't move in space.
We moved in time.
It's Ursa Major...
and Orion.
And there is the North Star.
And our...
Sun.
And the Earth was
silent and empty.
And the darkness...
over the abyss.
That means,
we're on Earth?
Before the beginning
of life itself?
About four billion years ago...
But how did you
figure that out?
This is the fragment
that flew off the Sphere
when David fired at it.
Here is the broken fragment.
And here's the same piece
on the bracelet I made for Amy.
Because it's the exact
same fragment,
the Sphere here...
and the other one on Earth...
are the exact same Sphere.
But in different times.
Some civilization sent
the Sphere on Earth
to create a biosphere
suitable for them.
But something went wrong.
But that means
no matter what we do here,
we won't save
the people on Earth.
There's only
one option left.
Tell Amy about those
extraterrestrial bacteria...
and help her
to create the vaccine.
How do you plan to do that?
We know that the Sphere...
will remain in the cave
until our time.
And that I will make
this fragment
into a bracelet for Amy.
I'll write her a message,
telling her how
to connect the Spheres.
But Amy had the bracelet
before we left.
She didn't say anything
about it.
I believe Amy will miss me.
She will come for the bracelet,
and sooner or later,
she will see these inscriptions.
What's left,
is to put the part back,
and reconfigure the systems.
Or the life that we know...
will never appear.
Neither will humanity.
Steve! Steve!
Ryan is planning on
blowing up the Sphere.
Connect me to him.
He switched off his radio.
You need to find him
and explain everything.
Go, I've reopened the airlock.
Stop right there.
Ryan.
The Sphere is our only chance.
Don't even try.
Okay, okay.
But your plan still won't work.
It will.
You'll see.
You want to take the bomb
to the cave,
wait for the Trojan there,
and blow it up
along with the Sphere.
But what if it attacks you
on the way?
Then I will go up...
in smoke with him.
And you will lose.
After all,
the Sphere will continue
to create the environment
that the Trojan needs.
What do you suggest?
You got a better idea?
Let's lure the Trojan...
into the lander,
lock the airlocks,
and blow it up there.
Here?
Oh!
David, why?
For Rita.
She died!
She hasn't died yet...
You're deranged.
I'm not.
After what happened in the cave,
I understand.
The Trojan didn't kill me.
And it doesn't do anything
without a reason.
It chose me!
And I will help it.
We weren't supposed to be here.
We're a mistake!
And you are the one who'd
helped me understand that.
I realized that
we're all just like you, Steve!
We weren't created right.
We're a malfunction
of the Sphere!
But I will fix it.
David, wake up!
You can't help Rita like that!
She wouldn't be born
to suffer...
and she will not die
at the age of eight.
No one else will suffer,
Steve, because
there will never be
any people to begin with!
People deserve a chance,
David.
People don't change.
Encounter to mission!
Encounter to mission!
Encounter to mission!
Encounter to mission!
Come in, mission.
Come on, guys.
Encounter to mission.
Encounter to mission!
Encounter to mission!
Encounter to mission!
Encounter to mission!
Richard...
Steve! Thank God.
Saw the explosion on camera.
- I thought you were all...
- The Trojan's been destroyed.
What about Ryan?
He didn't make it.
Steve...
your oxygen levels are dropping.
Looks like some shrapnel
pierced the tank.
How much time do I have?
About an hour.
Look, I'll...
I'll land a ship
and pick you up.
No.
There's a storm here.
You'll crash.
But what are you going to do?
I'm going into the cave.
I need to contact Amy.
Land the ship as soon
as the storm settles down.
Godspeed, Steve.
Please start working.
Steve!
Amy?
Steve!
Where are you?
I'm...
somewhere in the distant past.
What do you mean?
We don't have much time.
I know how to save the Earth.
You were on the right path.
There's a mechanism
that can help us
create the vaccine.
I saw it here with my own eyes.
Can you write something down?
S-sure. Sure.
You have to teach...
the plant cells
to quickly identify
any mutation of the virus.
Here's the antigen formula.
Amy, I promised
I'd come back to see you.
I'm so sorry.
No, no, Steve.
I only regret one thing.
That I'll never
hold you again...
and our child.
We're connected, remember?
You'll always be with me.
With us.
I love you.
Both of you.
I... love... you...
Steve.
Steve.
The Earth, O Lord,
is full of Thy Mercy.
Teach me Thy statutes.
Teach me good judgment
and knowledge.
Before I was afflicted,
I went astray.
But now I have kept Thy word.
Thy hands have made me
and fashioned me.
Let Thy tender mercies
come unto me,
that I... may live.
