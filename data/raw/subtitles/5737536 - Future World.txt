Earth...
before the war...
Life stretched out...
to every corner
of the planet.
It became a world filled
with innovation and opportunity.
Huge leaps in science saw humanity
achieve unimaginable results.
Robotics became the way
of the future.
Artificial intelligence
became the new religion.
We were the synthetic messiahs.
But such power...
in the proximity of primitives
only leads to one outcome:
war.
Bombs rained down...
wave after wave
after wave.
The world entered
a new Dark Age.
From the ash,
a great sickness was born:
The Red Fever.
Nations fell.
Societies collapsed.
Tribal warlords used us as
weapons against each other.
I was one of the last
synthetics to survive.
In the end, everyone lost.
I wanted life.
The humans wanted death.
I cannot be part of that.
I will not.
Delete entry and purge
all memories.
Manual override confirmed.
Initiate hibernation mode.
I'm gonna get you!
No you won't!
Move it up!
Yeah, I got it, boss.
Raiders!
- Raiders!
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Up top!
- Go, go!
Where are the children?
- Run, run, run!
- Go, go, go!
Where are the kids?
Get up! Up! Go on!
Food and shelter!
Raiders!
Fly! Now!
Come on!
Up top!
Raiders!
Right now! Right now!
You've got to go!
- Poppy, go! Poppy, please!
- Jack, you okay?
- We're gonna be okay.
- Poppy!
- Get up there, fast!
- What?
- Where do I go?
- Faster! Faster! Come on!
Go back to whatever hellhole
you crawled out of!
Gun?
I ain't seen a gun working
since the war!
Go ahead and shoot, old man!
No, Poppy!
Poppy, no!
Help me!
Whoo!
You're sure
this is the place?
Yeah, she's here.
I know it.
What was this place?
Place used to be
the future.
Now it's just dust.
Hey!
Come here.
This is the one we want.
Where is she?
Come on.
Wake up.
What do you see?
Who are you?
I'm the one
who gave you life.
Where am I?
I've been looking for you
for a long time.
No.
Come on! Wait up!
Careful, Billy! Not too
close to the water, please!
Hey, Rico!
Rico.
- How you feeling?
- Good.
How's she?
Better.
She just asked about you.
What you got there?
Still believe
in that magic, huh?
It can save her.
Paradise Beach ain't real.
I don't know.
I guess I just...
have a feeling
it's out there.
Go see her.
- Hey.
- Mm.
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.
Pour me some tea,
will you?
Yeah.
I remember when you were
just like those little ones.
You know there's medicine.
Paradise Beach.
I've heard stories
about it.
There's no
medicine out there.
There's just
death and hate.
I can't let you go, Mom.
This oasis saved me when
I was young and broken.
Take care of it
after I'm gone.
You're too young
to die, Momma.
Wouldn't it be nice if we could
decide that for ourselves?
You'll be
a great leader.
I can see it
in your eyes.
Mom, I...
I'm not really...
If I could do it again,
I would speak more softly.
I would listen longer...
and I would hold you
more closely.
Whoo! Woo-hoo!
Whoo!
Yeah!
Hey, old-timer.
Hey.
- How you doing?
- All right.
- Yeah?
- Yup.
Hey, uh...
You ever see
this place before?
Yeah, I've been there.
You don't want
to go out there.
It's not a good place.
They call it the Temple of Life,
but it's not what it seems.
Yeah, well, I'm going.
I can't stop you.
Do as you will.
This is my new bride!
Her name's Ash.
Who wants to meet her first?
Hold her down.
I'll fuck her in the face!
Fuck him.
Oh, shit!
Oh, yeah!
Yeah, man!
My man!
Now show me death.
Murder, murder, murder!
Murder, murder, murder!
Murder! Yeah!
Yeah.
Good girl.
Mom.
I'm gonna fix this.
I'm gonna fix this.
Hey!
Hey, the queen will die
if you don't tell me.
There's medicine
there, right?
Medicine that can
save her life.
Of course.
Look, I don't care
how dangerous it is.
You need to tell me
where it is.
All right, it's on the
shore of the Dead Ocean.
They can heal
any pain there.
- You can almost live forever.
- "Live forever"?
Live forever, but it's
not a good place.
It's not what
you think it is.
Tell me.
All right.
You take the North Star for three
days till you get to the Neon Forest.
When you get to
the Neon Forest,
there are people there,
but you gotta be careful.
They'll tell you
how to get to the Temple.
When you've reached
the Dead Sea,
you've reached the Temple.
Go.
Here.
You're gonna need this.
And take these, too.
Good luck.
Be home soon, Mom.
I knew I'd find you here.
You're not gonna
stop me, all right?
That was never the plan.
You need help out there.
Let's go!
Paradise Beach,
a thousand-mile ride...
His companion, Rico,
called it
"The Road to Death."
The prince spoke
of the smell.
A constant presence
in this wasteland...
is the smell of
human flesh burning,
fat melting.
Fuel for the raiders.
Two guns, ten bullets.
We're gonna need every one.
The old traveler said
to follow the North Star.
See where it takes us.
Yes, sir!
It's your host
with the most.
Welcoming all y'all
to Love Town,
aka Titty City.
And from city to city,
titty to titty,
we does it the best baby!
Welcome to Love Town,
where everything goes down.
Are they robots like me?
No, them bitches is real.
They're gonna get old, get
ugly, and they're gonna die.
Not like you, you gonna
stay perfect forever.
Okay, that's the place the old
traveler was talking about.
Let's just get information
and get out.
Keep your head down.
What is this place?
People who can't find love,
they buy love here.
Be careful.
Don't fall in love.
Stay close.
Hey!
Yeah.
You boys look
a little lost.
What can I get you?
Some whiskey.
Take a seat.
For some info,
if you got it.
What are you
looking for?
Something called
"Paradise Beach."
Can you point
the right way?
I ain't never
heard of it.
But I can ask Big Daddy.
He knows the wasteland
like the back of his hand.
I would be grateful.
Give these guys
a round on me.
Have fun.
- Think she's gonna help us?
- Not sure.
Yo, Warlord.
You enjoying that
robotic coo-coo?
Some guys down there are
asking about Paradise Beach.
- You seen them before?
- Nope. Not in here.
Them boys showed up
on some shiny bikes.
Damn sure ain't
from around here.
Yo, ain't you
forgetting something?
I'm sorry, Daddy,
I was gonna tell...
You think you slick,
don't you, bitch?
I got eyes all around this motherfucker.
Now hand it over.
Now kick rocks and go
serve them drinks.
Y'all ready to welcome
in the new bitches?
- Yes, sir.
- Well, let's get it, then.
You a bad girl.
You know, my family
died of the fever.
There was nothing
I could do.
Just because someone died doesn't
mean they're not with you.
You boys enjoying your beers?
You want a lap dance too,
pretty boy?
Nah, we're good,
we're good, we're good.
Our hoes ain't pretty
enough for you?
Maybe you'd rather have
some dick to suck.
Hey, we don't want
any trouble!
Usually we charge
a no-cover charge,
but you can just give us
the money straight up.
- Hey, leave us alone, all right?
- Shut the fuck up!
Put the knife away!
I find something I want,
I take it, okay?
Okay?
The fuck you gonna
do about it?
You ain't got
no fucking bull...
- Stay back!
- Hey!
Stay back, or I got one
for you, too!
Where the fuck
did they get ammo?
No one got bullets no more.
Let's get
out of here.
You boys sure do know
how to make an introduction.
And I like that shit, man.
But you can put
the gun down.
This is a place of peace!
Back to business,
everybody!
Not only am I the proprietor
of this fine establishment,
but I'm what you would call
a friendly panderer.
So, you're just a pimp?
Ha! You say that like that's a
bad thing or something, man.
Let's go.
Pimp is the loneliest
motherfucker in this wasteland.
I can't trust none
of these bitches.
Say, man, y'all trying to get
y'all dicks wet, or what?
We're actually looking
for Paradise Beach.
We've heard
there's medicine there.
Hm, Drug Town,
I know about it.
Can you get us there?
Look, man, that shit is
a dirty business, kid.
If I help y'all, shoot, it's
like I'm perjuring myself.
Well, what is it worth
to you cowboys?
So, we basically
partners now.
And I know somebody
that can get you there.
If you know what
I'm saying.
Hey, you're sure
you want to do this?
Let's see what
he has to say.
Calm him down,
and let's roll.
Come on, man.
Follow me.
See, man, y'all should
feel real special.
See, I never bring
nobody back here.
I call this my
Bitches Hall of Fame.
You the man, right?
Come in here,
follow me.
Got something special for...
Wait a motherfucking minute.
Wait a motherfuck...
Hey, bitches,
get the fuck out of here!
The fuck is wrong with y'all?
Can't believe this shit.
I have to ask
you to leave, too.
The kid needs
to stay in my sight.
Say, man, my girl is shy.
If y'all wanna go
to Paradise Beach,
he's gonna have to talk
to her all by his self.
Rico...
It's cool.
Hold on to this.
You gonna give
the little guy a gun?
Got a blanket
for him, too?
Oh, you's a flashy
cowboy, ain't you?
Did I tell you
I like that shit?
Now you, little fella,
check it out.
I need you to have
a good time.
Relax 'cause you
in good hands.
Welcome to Paradise.
Oh, yeah, one more thing.
Don't be no stranger
to danger.
'Cause it's
about to go down.
How can I help you?
I'm looking for
Paradise Beach.
Paradise Beach?
Yeah.
Yeah, my mom is very sick.
She's in trouble.
Yeah, and I don't have
a lot of time.
I want to help you.
You're very kind.
I can see it
in your eyes.
Who are you?
I'm Ash.
Your eyes...
Shut up
and get on with it.
Yes.
You're not human?
I'm as human as you are.
What do you see?
I see you.
Can you feel?
I feel you.
- Oh, shit!
- Look at that little old bitch.
Bring him to me!
Shit... I think I want me
a robot bitch.
Bring him over here!
- Oh, ho, ho, ho!
- Get the fuck off me!
Get off!
Fuck you!
Come on.
Rico!
- Rico!
- String him up!
Rico!
Why did you kill Rico?
Bring me the gun!
Where'd you get
these bullets?
Where are you from, boy?
Pull him up.
- What are you doing?
- Pull him up!
You gonna talk?
Let him down!
Where are
you from, boy?
Pull him up!
You better
sing, bird!
You better sing!
All right, let him down.
There.
The Oasis.
The Oasis?
- Yeah.
- You got more bullets there?
Yes.
You gonna take us there?
Fuck you.
Pull him up!
You better start
singing, little bird!
You're running out of time!
I'll talk.
Let him down!
You're a bad bitch.
- Here you go.
- Ah!
Get up. Get up!
Let's go, baby.
Let's go!
We ride south
to the prince's homeland.
The warlord would rape and
murder everyone in the Oasis.
It was at that moment I became aware
of exactly how different I was.
But first...
I had to set things right.
What are you doing?
Come back!
Come back!
Come back,
you fucking bitch!
God damn it!
Whoo!
Come on, come on!
Come on!
Down there! Go get her!
Go get her!
Stop them!
Over here!
Where the fuck are they?
Fuck!
Come back!
Come back!
Come back, you fucking
robotic bitch!
Fucking come back!
Why did you save me?
I don't know.
You're his robot, right?
Yes.
So, then why aren't
you listening to him?
Maybe I'm malfunctioning.
What is this place?
I think it's a church.
My mother told me
about places like this.
People would come here
when their souls need cleansing.
"Souls"?
What is souls?
Soul?
It's kind of hard to explain actually.
It's something inside you.
It makes you who you are.
All right.
There you go.
People used to come here
to try and talk to God.
Cleanse themselves
of their sins.
What is "sins"?
Sin? You'll s...
Bad things that we do
to each other.
Like what I did to you.
I don't want
to do it anymore.
I don't want to sin.
Do you think
I have a soul?
Yeah.
Yeah, I believe you do.
But I'm not human.
One time, a traveler played
guitar for me in the Oasis.
I had never heard anything
like it before. It was...
It was... It was amazing.
It was like
from another world.
And I asked him, "So, how
do you play this music?"
And he told me his purpose on earth was
to reveal that the guitar had a soul.
Can you teach me
how to talk to God?
Yeah.
Let's get on our knees.
And, uh...
close your eyes.
Your head just...
He's going to help us.
Ash?
Ash!
Ash, are you okay?
Ash, get up!
Ash.
Ash!
All right.
It's real.
It's real.
Ash.
Ash, it's real.
We made it.
Who are you?
Get on your knees!
Boo!
Oh...
Did I scare you?
Who are you?
Where's Ash?
You wanna play
a little game? Yeah!
Boys like to play games,
don't they?
- No, I don't. I want...
- Shh.
So, here's the rules:
you ask a question,
and I ask a question.
Sounds like fun, no?
So...
Who are you?
I'm Prince.
Wait a minute. Seriously?
You're a prince?
I mean, wow!
I'm in the presence
of royalty!
- Who are you?
- Well, you know...
This is mi casa and I'm the
jefe, that's who I am.
This is the Temple
of Life, isn't it?
Oh, wow!
Oh, man. Wow!
Paradise Beach!
God, it's so fucking pretty!
But unfortunately for you, young
man, this isn't paradise.
This...
This...
is Drug Town!
Mm!
Pretty one.
What do we got here?
Temple of Life,
I have to say,
that works,
it really does,
but, you know, this is
better than life, man!
I mean, there's
no pain here.
It's only bliss!
I mean, where else are you gonna find
that in this fucked up world, right?
So, you're doing the whole tourist
thing of the wasteland or...
is there something else
you're after?
Well, I heard
you have cures.
Oh, yeah!
We have loads of cures.
A lot.
My mom, she's very sick.
She has the Red Fever.
That's a terrible,
terrible sickness.
Wow, I feel for you.
But that particular cure,
you know,
it's just a little hard
to come by these days.
So, you don't have it.
We do. Come on!
This is it, all right?
This is where you're gonna
get your medicine, Prince.
In here?
Well, look, I know
it's a little...
not much to look at, okay?
But we have everything
you need.
First.
You have to become
one of us!
What?
Hey.
You want the medicine
for your mother?
This is how
you're gonna get it.
- Why?
- Soon...
- Wait, wait! Wait, wait!
- ...your troubles
will be a thing of the past!
Okay, just hold on
one second because...
Are you in?
Welcome to my world.
Feel that medicine
flow through you.
Let it take over you, yeah.
Yeah, right?
It's so nice.
It's so great, right?
Find out what's up
with you.
Uhh!
You are bleeding
like a monkey.
Mm! Yeah.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Ahh!
All right.
Ahh!
Oh, yeah.
Ahh!
You feel that, huh?
Yeah?
Yeah, you do.
I'm just gonna look
at it right here.
Come on, baby.
- Yeah.
- Feel the pleasure.
Yeah, it magnifies everything,
that stuff burning
through your bloodstream,
and everything
is magnified!
Joy, love, lust.
Jealousy!
Fucking hate!
Hate of the wasteland!
Now the moment of truth.
Hello?
You register?
Where am I?
Don't worry.
You're in a safe space.
Yeah, um...
Sorry about that, that
stuff's hard to come by,
and you were bleeding
like a pig.
You saved me.
Well, yeah, yeah,
sort of.
Thank you.
Are you a prisoner?
I wouldn't call
myself that.
So, you can leave
whenever you want?
You wouldn't understand.
But if I had a choice,
I'd stay where I'm at.
The wasteland's full
of awful people.
I do understand.
That's how I got this.
What do you think?
This is all
I've ever wanted.
This...
more than
anything in Oasis.
Oasis?
What's that, sweetie?
Oasis?
It's alive.
My mother didn't
want me to leave.
She thought
it was perfect.
It's not a complete and total
mess like the rest of the world.
It's blissful.
Yeah, it sounds
pretty damn near perfect.
You see that?
Water here is dead.
We got nothing, we got nothing,
nothing, nothing inside of us.
You know, I'd love
to see a tree,
see a flower
in my lifetime.
I mean, it's sad, isn't it?
Isn't it so fucking sad?
Why do you have to make me
so fucking sad?
Here.
Try this.
Just go...
Go ahh...
So, your
traveling companion, Ash?
She's the perfect
woman, right?
Incorruptible by time.
Not of flesh and bones,
but of something pure.
Yeah, God, I love that.
Purity, purity,
it's just...
It's what
I've been after.
Sweet dreams.
My son...
My prince...
Come home.
Oh, shit!
Get up! Get up!
You're just a sweet
little baby, aren't you?
My sweet, little baby.
What?
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't be sad.
Don't be sad.
Because I'm gonna
cherish you...
and I'm gonna bring out
the best in you.
And then... And...
And you're gonna bring out
the best in me, too.
Right?
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you.
Game's simple, Prince.
What you want...
is in that
sasquatch's belly.
Now we're
gonna make a deal.
It's gonna be fun, kind of
like a fight to the death.
All right?
You win, you get cure.
You lose, you die.
Fun!
Here's the wild card.
Now for the wild card.
Can't believe it.
Didn't know
you had it in you.
What you want is
in that man's stomach.
You earned that, boy.
Ash.
Let's get out of here.
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You asked for a cure...
not a robot.
No.
- I'm not going anywhere without her.
- I gave you your medicine.
I saved your friend's life.
She stays... with me.
No, fuck you, fuck this.
We're leaving.
Look, you can leave now,
or we could end it right here.
Hm?
I'm not leaving without her.
Leave.
Time's running out.
Ash...
Go.
Breaking my heart.
Told you I choose
what I do.
I'm gonna get you out.
Shit! What if they come?
- It's okay.
- Shit.
Lei, it's okay.
How can you be so calm when
everything's gone to shit?
Stop.
It is what it is.
It is what it is?
I wish I could be like you.
I wish I could just...
not feel my feelings
and worries so much.
You should cherish your feelings
whether they're good or bad.
Can you feel this?
And this?
Yes.
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't be doing this.
I shouldn't take
advantage of you.
Lei...
I like this feeling.
It was
at this moment...
I made a connection.
I feel something.
Something pure.
I've never had
this feeling before.
It's so different
than all the others.
Sorry.
Don't be.
I wanted to.
Could feel your heartbeat.
Your energy.
And I don't even know
what that is anymore.
I was taken from my family
when I was a young girl.
A group of raiders took me.
I was so little.
And I learned how really
awful people can be.
Then I got older.
They no longer had use
for me, so...
they just sold me away.
That's how I ended up here.
I'm really glad
you fixed me, though.
Me, too.
She was supposed to be
the perfect woman.
She's pure, right?
Wow.
So fucking pure.
I gave you...
I gave you everything,
though.
I raised you,
I gave you respect.
You don't understand.
You took away the one thing
that was supposed to be mine.
Fucking corrupted her!
You're a...
You're... You're a virus.
You're a...
disgusting, sneaky,
little virus.
Don't say that!
Shut your fucking mouth.
You know what?
Everything's gonna be okay.
No, no, no, yeah.
We're gonna fix this.
So, um...
What we're gonna do is...
You're gonna wipe
her hard drive.
You're gonna wipe it clean.
Boom. Done.
Fresh fucking start,
right? Yeah.
When she wakes up, she's
not gonna remember you...
or any of this shit.
When she wakes up...
she's gonna see me.
She's gonna...
She's gonna love me.
They're right there! Get them!
Hurry up! This way!
Hurry the fuck up!
They're right there!
Get them!
What the fuck?
No!
My fucking palace.
I'm the fucking jefe.
Get the fuck out!
Yeah!
Fuck you!
No fucking pain,
motherfucker!
You like that?
You like that?
Fucking bitch.
Hi.
Stop.
Take them.
They tried to take
my bride.
She's mine!
They tried to make
friends with her.
Take her away from me!
She's mine!
Put them down there.
Come on, Ash. Ash.
Cut off their heads.
That's not you, Ash.
Don't listen to him, Ash.
It's not you.
It's not you.
It's not you.
Kill them.
- Kill them now.
- No.
Stop,
you demonic bitch!
Kill them!
No!
- Stop!
- What?
- Stop the bike!
- Why?
- Stop!
- Why?
- Ash, what are you doing?
- Stop! Get off!
What are you doing?
Ash!
Warlord is dead.
But another
will replace him.
This world has no memory.
Everyone,
the prince is back!
I have to go
do something.
What?
Where are you going?
You gave me a soul.
Mom.
Mom!
I have the medicine.
My son...
We continue onwards...
searching for others
like me.
We have to find them and
show them what we learned.
That beyond all intellect and
knowledge exists something greater,
something more powerful
than any person,
any weapon.
Hope.
Man, what's taking
so god damn long with my food?
Can a pimp get something to
eat around this motherfucker?
Shit, if I have to wait
any longer,
I swear I'm gonna put my foot
in one of you bitches' ass.
Fuck!
Ahh! Fucking bitch!
You're all free now!
What the fuck
are you doing?
Fuck! Rosie!
Rosie!
Oh!
Fuck! Help!
Somebody fucking help!
Fuck!
