CAMERA ASSISTANT:

(CLAPPERBOARD SNAPS)
PRODUCER: In 1981,
you did this interview
with People  magazine where,
for the first time, really,
you spoke openly
about your past with Ike.
Yeah.
PRODUCER: And I'm curious
if you can remember at all
any of the thoughts
you had around the decision
-to be public about that?
-About my past?
PRODUCER: About your past,
but also, I guess,
-about the abuse specifically.
-Yeah. Yeah, that was quite...
nerve-racking.
Actually, I called my psychic
and I said,
"What's gonna happen?"
'Cause I was really apprehensive
about giving the story away,
because it was telling,
it was really telling.
And she said, "No, Tina,
it's going to do
just the opposite.
It's gonna break everything
wide open."
CARL ARRINGTON:
In the early eighties,
being in  People  magazine was
the equivalent of going viral.
We had 30 million readers,
and if somebody wanted to reach
a lot of people,
there was really no bigger place
to go than  People  magazine.
I was the music editor of
People  magazine for many years,
uh, and this is
the December 7th, 1981 issue,
when Tina decided
to tell her story.
And it was the first time
she'd told the story
in public to a journalist.
So, um, this is the story.
I reported it and wrote it
for People  magazine.
This is, uh,
the picture of Tina.
(READS HEADLINE OUT LOUD)
"Tina Turner remains
rock's original Jagger,
a primitive force who,
glittering in sequins
and a gold chain miniskirt,
typically assaults the stage
in mid-scream
with both legs pumping,
hips grinding,
long mane whirling,
and her mouth wrapped around
some of the sexiest sounds
ever set to music.
More than five years have passed
since Tina's bitter break
with Ike Turner,
her long-time husband, sideman,
and music collaborator
on such classics
as 'Proud Mary'
and 'Come Together.'
Only now is Tina able to discuss
what she claims
were the harrowing events
leading up to their split."
TINA: (ARCHIVAL)
I lived 16 years with a man
that I knew there was no way
I could ever be happy with,
but I felt that
I had to stay there.
ARRINGTON: Mm-hmm.
TINA: You have to believe me,
now, when I tell you something.
My ex-husband
was a physically violent man.
I went through basic torture.
ARRINGTON: Torture? You would
say-- you would call it torture?
TINA: I-- To me it was.
A lot of people don't know,
and your magazine
will probably be the first
to make it publicly known.
I was living a life of death.
I didn't exist.
-But I survived it.
-ARRINGTON: Hm.
TINA: And when I walked out,
I walked.
And I didn't look back.
ARRINGTON: (PRESENT)
People choose
to tell their story
for lots of different reasons.
I think she told me so much
because she wanted
to just tell it
and then forget it.
It didn't quite
work out that way
because now that story
is a great mark of her life.

was our radio during that time.

were you singing as a member

so seeing Lucille Ball

all the beautiful ladies
of Hollywood,
they were a role model

But I didn't think that
I would actually achieve that,

I didn't have the means.

she finally learned

we was coming from

"Man, can we play a song?"

play one number, so anyway,
he said, "Man, you guys

LODER: Ike Turner
is a very important part
of R&B history.
Everybody relied on him
'cause he really knew music,
and he scored a real hit record
with a song in 1951
called "Rocket 88."
People say it's
the first rock and roll record.
And when it comes out,
Chess has credited it
to Jackie Brenston
and his Delta Cats.
Ike Turner did that song,
you know.
He made everything
about it happen,
and it's credited
to one of his saxophone players.
Imagine how he feels about this?
And I think that's the story
of his career.
I think he became paranoid
about that,
he said, "People are always
trying to rip me off."
RHONDA GRAAM:
He was always obsessed on it.
"Everybody leaves me.
I make 'em, you know, popular
and get a hit record
and everything for them,
and they all leave me."
TINA: (PRESENT)
Ike had a problem
of writing songs for people

-INTERVIEWER 8: Yeah?

WINFREY: Nobody talked
about sexual abuse,
physical abuse, domestic abuse.
Abuse, period.
Our generation
is the generation
that started
to break the silence.
INTERVIEWEE: Tina, she couldn't
voice her own opinions.
Everything that she did
was with Ike.
ARRINGTON: The idea of Tina
as a presence on her own
and having escaped,
people loved that story.
They wanted-- You know,
here was somebody to root for.
DAVIES: Once the word was out,
we met a guy called Carter,
John Carter at Capital
who believed in her.
JOHN CARTER: (ARCHIVAL)
I had always been
interested in artists
that no one else
was interested in.
Once a star, always a threat,
and that's the way I felt
about Tina.
So you play that thing,
you're playing that,
and you're playing
the strum under me,
and we move down stage
with that.
Let's just get that right.
That's exactly...
DAVIES: Carter basically gave us
a development deal.
We tried probably eight
or ten tracks,
still trying to find our way.
We never got quite there.
Stay under me there,
but just come down.
Keep the pulse under me.
Don't lose the--
CARTER: We record a few things,
and as much as Roger
and I would get enthusiastic
about a song here
and a song there,
it was never really
the body of work that we needed.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
And then one day,
Carter rang me up,
beside himself,
because there'd been
a change of management
at Capital Records.
And they'd been in a meeting,
and they'd been going through
the roster of artists, I guess,
and the new management
didn't want Tina on the label.
CARTER:
The new regime comes in...
-INTERVIEWER 9: Mm-hmm.
-...and like any new regime,
they've got their own idea
about what they wanna do.
-INTERVIEWER 9: Right.
-CARTER: So I flip out,
I go downstairs, and I said,
"Hey, this is my act."
And the classic quote is,
"Carter, you signed
this old nigger douchebag?"
INTERVIEWER 9: Whoa. Whoa.
CARTER: "Yeah, yeah, I did,
and I'm really happy about it.
Now pick up the phone
and call Roger Davies."
-INTERVIEWER 9: Wow.
-CARTER: He said,
"No fucking way."
And I get on my knees,
and I said,
"I'm now gonna beg you,
and I'm not gonna get up
until you pick up the phone."
(LAUGHS)
And there was a long stare down,
-and he picks up the phone.
-INTERVIEWER 9: Wow.
CARTER: Well, he says, "Okay,
she's back on the roster."
-INTERVIEWER 9: Mm-hmm.
-"You finish your record,
but you understand
that we're gonna do nothing.

DAVIES: She always had a belief
it was gonna be okay.
And I think you had to have
that belief to get-- keep going.
Radio, as you know in America,
was very categorized.
And there's pop,

TINA: (ARCHIVAL) The man
that I'm looking for, actually,
has to be a very strong man,
to wear, actually, the trousers,
but yet not to dominate me.
And that's fair.

-FAN 7: Tina, over here!
-(INDISTINCT CLAMOR)
BACH:
We met at a Cologne airport.
No, actually it was,
uh, Düsseldorf Airport.
And, uh, her manager, Roger,
asked me to, uh--
to pick up Tina.
TINA: He was younger.
He was 30 years old at the time.
The prettiest face.
I mean, you cannot.
I said, it was like saying,
"Where did he come from?"
He was really so good looking.
My heart went,
"ba-boomp, bop, bop."
And it means that
a soul has met.
And my hands were shaking.
So Roger said to me,
"Tina, you ride with Erwin."
And I-- I wanted to go, "Yay."
(LAUGHS)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
BACH: We enjoyed the ride.
I enjoyed driving the artist.
Actually a superstar for us,
where you're normally
a little nervous, you know.
But, uh,
I wasn't nervous either.
I was just doing the job.
TINA: (PRESENT) When he
found out that I liked him,
he came to America.
We were in Nashville,
I think it was,
and I said to him,
"When you come to LA,
I want you to make love to me."
But I thought that I could say
that 'cause I was a free woman,
I didn't have a boyfriend.
I liked him.
There was nothing wrong with it,
it was just sex.
And he looked at me
as if he doesn't--
didn't believe
what he was hearing.  (LAUGHS)
I laugh now at the moment,
because I sometimes
get that look
when I do certain things.
He was just so, so different.
So laid back, so comfortable,
so unpretentious.
And that was the beginning
of our relationship.
(CROWD MURMURING)
TINA: I really needed love.
I just needed to love a person.
How many years later, darling,
we got married?
BACH: Twenty-seven.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
BACH: It's love. It's something
we both have for each other.
I always refer to it
as an electrical charge.
I still have it.
I still have it and even though
when I left her
two hours ago,
three hours ago this morning,
I still have that feeling.
That feeling is still with me,
and, uh, it's in my heart.
I feel very warm about this.

JOURNALIST:
First, a minute to remember
one of the fathers
of rock and roll.
Ike Turner died today at age 76.
Back in 1951,
Turner helped record
what is one of the first
rock and roll records,
"Rocket 88," with his band,
The Kings of Rhythm.
He may be best known
as the abusive ex-husband
of Tina Turner, with whom
he performed for many years.
After their separation,
Ike Turner continued
to make music.
In 1991, he was inducted into
the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame,
and earlier this year,
his record  Risin' with the Blues
won a Grammy
for Traditional Blues Album.
TINA: (PRESENT) For a long time,
I did hate Ike,
I have to say that.
But then after he died,
I really realized
that he was a sick person.
He was an ill person
at the soul.
He did get me started,
and, uh, he was good to me
in the beginning.
So I have some good thoughts.
Uh, maybe it was a good thing
that I met him.
That, I don't know.
♪ (QUIET MUSIC PLAYING) ♪
TINA: It hurts to have to
remember those times.
But at a certain stage,
forgiveness takes over.
Forgiving means
not to hold on.
You let it go,
because it only hurts you.
Not forgiving, you suffer,
'cause you think about it
over and over again.
And for what?
I had an abusive life.
There's no other way
to tell the story.
It's a reality, it's a truth.
That's what you've got.
So you have to accept it.
♪ (MUSIC CONTINUES) ♪
(INDISTINCT CLAMOR)
Working it.
Working it as always.
Why thank you, honey.
Can you tell us
what Tina means to you?
The money shot is coming.
♪ (DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES) ♪
TINA: Some people say
the life that I lived
and the performances
that I gave,
the appreciation
is blasting with the people.
And yeah, I should be proud
of that-- I am--
but when do you stop
being proud?
(LAUGHING) I mean, when do you--
How do you bow out slowly,
just go away?
(SIGHS)
BACH: She said,
"I'm going to America
and I'm going to say goodbye
to my American fans,
and, uh, I'll wrap it up."
And I think this
documentary here and the play,
this is it.
It's a closure, a closure.
CROWD: (CHANTING)
Tina, Tina, Tina!
(CHEERING)
(CHANTING CONTINUES)
What I gleaned
from her life was love.
Love of self,
love of her family,
love of her-- of her talent.
Love of audiences,
of music, of freedom.
But there's a part of her,
I guess,
that we've all laid claim to,
we've all embraced
across the world,
and I hope she knows that.
You know, how beloved,
how loved she is.
She is absolutely adored.
