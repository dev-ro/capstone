God is fed up with mankind.
Didn't He create them
after His own image?
Didn't he give them
a world to live on?
Well, look what they're doing.
They're trying to clone themselves
and they're destroying their world.
God is getting impatient, Angel.
He wants the Stone Tablets back
with his Ten Commandments on them.
You were assigned to do so, Angel.
You've been on the job
for almost ninety human years.
You've even caused two world wars,
and still...
I had to.
It was the only way to bring the
future child's grandparents together.
You needed two world wars to get
two couples to sleep with each other?
Good heavens.
If you go on like this,
the humans will be wiped out before
we get the Stone Tablets back.
It got out of hand. The wars lasted
longer than I expected.
Humans have their own
free will, you know.
We know, but when can we expect him?
Angel?
When can we expect our envoy
with the Ten Commandments?
When can we expect our envoy
with the covenant?
Well, Angel, when?
Why don't you say something?
Is there a problem?
It takes a long time
to create the right child
with the right genes and DNA.
Do you mean the child
is not conceived yet?
What is taking you so long?
Do you have the mother?
And the father?
I need two men.
Two?
Otherwise it won't work.
It's a complicated program.
Deal with it. Now.
I can't do it any faster.
You can't force people.
The best you can do is
a push in the right direction.
Why don't you go down to Earth?
I used to do that.
I whispered into Mary's ear,
and bam, she was pregnant.
Gabriel, He has forbidden us
to go down.
We must pull the strings
from up here.
Times have changed.
People don't believe in us anymore.
Satan reigns down there.
You have 17 human years and
9 human months to finish the job.
Not a grain of sand more.
Gabriel will supervise to make sure
the assignment is completed...
in time.
If not, you know the price
you have to pay.
17 human years? That's impossible.
Nothing is impossible.
I need more time.
Forget it. We have to obey
the Master's orders.
I can't understand why
the Master doesn't take care of it.
You want to question Him?
Listen to my advice.
Never, ever question Him.
- But surely...
No!
Do you want to go back to Earth
and live the miserable human life?
I don't.
These are the ones?
The ones you selected?
Onno Quist, Max Delius, Ada Brons.
Where are we in human years?
The evening of August the 13th, 1967.
What's your next step?
I need to get the men together.
Is that a problem?
One is in bed with a girl.
The other is at his father's
birthday party.
The fuses have blown.
- Did you use the toaster?
No, Mrs. Quist.
No, mother, it isn't the toaster.
It has begun.
What has begun?
What has begun?
The end of the world is nigh.
Who'd like a homemade ginger snap?
Homemade ginger snap.
My God, why hast thou
forsaken me?
Mummy, I'm scared.
- Onno, please.
It's father's birthday.
But can we be sure that
he is my father?
- Isn't that right, mother?
"What?
Everyone knows you cheated on him
with Fidel Castro.
Fidel who?
Oh yes, Che Guevara is
more your type, isn't he?
What are you talking about?
I never cheated on your father.
No, but you cheated on me!
With father, by conceiving me!
Onno, there are limits.
- I'm sick of this clown.
Father, can't you stop this?
Onno, that's enough.
The boy will turn out all right.
Thank you, father.
You're terrible.
You're just like me.
I'm going.
I'm coming.
Please don't bother
trying to find her.
She's not there.
Stop. Your hubcap.
Might this hubcap be traveling
to Amsterdam by any chance?
Get in.
Me?
In this car?
Only under protest.
Haven't we met before?
Oh, no. Wasn't your picture
in the paper recently?
Of course my picture
was in the paper recently.
Why?
I have an honorary doctorate
from Uppsala University.
What for?
For deciphering
the Etruscan language.
What about you?
What do you do for a living?
I've never seen your picture
in the paper.
I'm an astronomer.
I'm on the brink of
discovering heaven.
Onno Quist.
Max Delius.
Jesus!
Oh yeah, sorry. I've been
meaning to get that fixed.
Are you related to Quist,
the former Prime Minister?
That former Prime Minister
happens to be my father.
I admired him when I was a kid.
I still admire him.
Is this your house?
Well, my laundromat.
Thanks for the lift.
Yeah.
I'll read in the papers
when you've discovered heaven.
Do you know what time it is?
Normal people have to get up early.
- They work.
Please, open the door.
I'll come and collect these
in a few days.
That's the quickest laundromat
I've ever seen. What's her number?
What's this protest about then?
Vietnam, I suppose.
Great, but why can't they do it
during working hours?
Go back. This is ridiculous.
Fuck.
Animals!
Christ!
Stay in the car.
Stay in the car!
You've ruined my fucking car!
Fuck you, you capitalist pig!
That's my friend,
you psychotic barbarian!
Get off me, you bastard!
Unwashed, it grieves me to say.
Thank you.
Are you aware that
your face is all wrong?
You've got unsympathetic eyes,
a ridiculously weak mouth,
and your face doesn't belong at all.
- That's right.
t's not right.
No, no, I mean, right,
it's not right.
Mother was Jewish.
Father, Austrian.
Lethal combination
during World War Il.
Get off me, you fucking pig!
Get off, you fucking fascist!
Would you like a seat?
Fascists!
So, did your...
father save your mother then?
No, he turned her in.
Your father denounced your mother
to the Nazis?
He was ashamed she was Jewish.
What happened to her?
Auschwitz.
Thank you.
What's in this bag?
Dirty communist laundry.
I'll have it back, if I may.
That's Onno Quist, son of
former Prime Minister Quist.
Here, have a look at these.
What's this? Communist propaganda?
"The Discos of Phaistos".
Give that back to me!
Get your hands off my friend.
- You've absolutely no right.
Get off him.
Get your filthy
barbarian claws off me.
Neanderthal!
What's so important about
the manuscript?
If I discover what's written on
the Discos, I shall understand life.
I bet I discover heaven first.
Oh, a bet is it? You're on.
Give me my bag, fucking fascists!
Shut up!
I always wondered if my mother
was a redhead.
You talk about your dead mother
while ogling a girl's legs?
What kind of man are you?
The kind that ogles a girl's legs
as he talks about his dead mother.
What happened to your father?
He was executed after the war.
- How old were you then?
"Twelve.
- And now you're...?
- Thirty-three.
Me too. What's your date of birth?
November the 27th, 1933.
November the 6th. That makes me
three weeks older than you.
You're a mere child,
and don't you forget it.
- Don't you drive?
- Me? Drive?
Driving is for chauffeurs.
Stop!
I was three weeks premature.
We were conceived on the same day.
Nine months earlier,
so that must have been...
February the 27th, 1933.
February the 27th was the day
the Reichstag burned down.
You and I were conceived on
the night of the Reichstag fire.
While Van Der Lubbe was setting fire
to the curtains in Berlin,
our parents were crawling
all over each other.
We're fraternal...
identical... twins.
Yes! Yes!
We're cosmic twins!
We're cosmic twins!
We're cosmic twins!
Freud and Mahler once walked
on this very spot.
It seems Gustave Mahler couldn't
get it up with Alma Mahler anymore.
He was impotent. So Freud put him
through emergency analysis.
You could do with emergency analysis.
Is that a coincidence, or what?
Alma Mahler. "Mein Leben". Look.
I'm going to make her touch me
the way she touches her cello.
Excuse me.
"A Fairy Tale",
by Janacek, right?
Sorry to disturb you. We were
looking for some books.
Customers.
Oswald? Customers.
We'd like to take the Mahler
and the Piranesi, please.
And this one as well.
You pay.
This is for you.
That's very kind of you.
Max Delius.
Ada Brons.
There you are. Sir?
And this is my very best friend,
Onno Quist.
I research the distribution of
neutral hydrogen
in the Milky Way.
Thank you.
Have you two known each other long?
We've never not known each other.
Will you excuse me?
Hi, Ada. How are you?
Oh, God.
What's the matter?
I've just met this man
and he's like a meteorite.
He's just fallen into my life.
That's beautiful.
So why are you crying?
I don't know.
I just...
don't even know him and...
the thought of
never seeing him again...
Oh, God.
Are you sure I can't
drop you somewhere?
No, I like to walk in the rain.
Be sure Ada gets back to her friends.
- It was lovely meeting you.
- Bye, Onno.
I'll pop upstairs, get the Janacek,
then we'll be on our way.
Do you want to come up
and see my record collection?
‘ADA
Poetic theme.
Pity there's no 'M' or 'X'
on the keyboard.
You find those only on the
higher overtones of a Stradivarius.
Is that how you see yourself?
Onno would say...
I'm in the ultimate metaphysical
realms of the unknowable.
And what would you say?
Shall we get undressed
and get into bed?
Be careful.
Don't hurt me.
Are you still a...?
Are you here to see me
or get your laundry done?
Why don't I see you more often?
You spend more time with Max
than you do with me.
What Max and I have,
you and I can never have.
But what you and I have
Max and I could never have.
You've changed since
you met him.
Women's intuition.
Yes, I'm sorry, my love, but...
although women have everything,
free will, brains,
feelings,...
washing machines.
But only men have intuition.
You're impossible.
Improbable, perhaps.
Onno, you've put it on short spin.
Onno.
Onno.
Onno?
Mrs., can Onno come out to play?
Come down, I've got something
really important to tell you.
That took a while. You have to
finish your homework first?
What's the matter?
- You know what your problem is?
No.
Your bloody intuition.
I don't like your intuition one bit.
But...
"What am I going to do now?
Who's going to do my laundry?
Answer me that.
Who's going to do my laundry now?
Come on then, out with it.
What's so important that
you've got to tell me?
I'm in love.
Ada's incredible.
She closes a book like I do,
the way she comes out
of the bathroom...
She's gorgeous.
You ruined my relationship
just to tell me that?
I'll end up with matted hair
and a straggly beard
and a crazed look in my eye,
begging for change from strangers,
because you wanted to tell me
you're in love with Ada?
It's never happened to me before.
Jesus!
Bravo.
Did you like it, Onno?
I liked it because
you played it.
0Onno's not much of a music lover.
Why not?
Music is only for women.
Why is music only for women?
Like driving is
only for chauffeurs.
And ice-cream is for priests.
And you are both for me.
They wanna spread their Coca-Cola,
Mickey Mouse culture round the world.
Down with American imperialism!
Down with American interference
in Vietnam!
Down with American interference
in Cuba!
Vietnam!
Get the fuck out!
We welcome two comrades
from revolutionary Cuba
tonight as our guests.
They are comrade Enrico Canhola
and comrade Ruben Laguna.
If you're so fond of Cuba,
why don't you go there
and cut sugar cane?
I have cut sugar cane
in Cuba, my friend.
Yes, for the cameras, you fake.
You're a fascist!
No, sir, I am a member of
the Socialist Party.
What have you done for
the revolution?
After your revolution,
I shall be president.
After the revolution, you'll be
lucky to be a garbage collector.
I'd be happy if it meant
clearing up garbage like you,
you posturing fake!
Thank you, Bart Bork.
Now comrades, some music.
Miss Ada Brons will play
suite number one
by Johann Sebastian Bach.
I hardly dare ask you this,
but are you faithful to her?
Yes.
Well, not during the week.
During the week, when I'm
at work, I have to.
I have to.
But weekends I'm monogamous.
- Look after that girl, hear me?
+ do.
"Cause you don't deserve her.
Onno.
Gabriel, I think it's time to
get Max out of the way for a while.
All right. Have it your way.
What's the matter?
I'm sorry.
Do you know gypsies are the only
ones on Earth never to wage a war?
Is that all?
21 years ago today
my father was executed.
I didn't think it had
affected me much.
How much do you know about him?
Almost nothing.
I always thought I'd be
desecrating my mother's memory
if I found out too much about him.
No, you need to understand
everything about your father.
I'm going to help you.
We start tomorrow morning.
Why were you crying tonight?
You never tell me anything.
- You tell Onno everything.
- That's different.
Why, because you love him
and you don't love me?
What Onno and I have together,
you and I will never have,
but what you and I have together,
Onno and I will never have.
Why, because I'm just
one of your girlfriends?
Max,
are you faithful to me?
Of course.
Your father kept this picture
in his cell.
You're entitled to it.
The top half of your face
resembles your mother.
The bottom half
is like your father.
A letter to Gen. Von Schumann.
Your father asks the General's help
to rid him, once and for all,
of his wife.
Here is the proof that Von Schumann
had your mother and her parents
deported to Auschwitz.
I'm sorry.
When you get home,
11 be gone.
Perhaps you won't understand
immediately, but if you think,
you'll be able to work it out.
I've had a wonderful time with you,
for which I'm grateful
and I will never forget.
You meant a lot for me and perhaps
I meant a little to you, too.
If we meet again,
I hope it will be as good friends.
Deep thoughts?
- Do you really want to know?
Unless it's a secret.
It's a huge secret,
so I'll tell you straight away.
I've been pondering
this magic square.
I don't live with Max anymore.
I left him.
What?
How is he?
Is he okay?
What did you know of Max's past?
Nothing.
Talking was something
he did with you.
His father killed his mother.
Indirectly.
I feel as though I've been
living with a stranger.
- Do you want him back?
No.
Did he have other girlfriends?
Max is difficult with women,
you know?
He can get them
but he can't keep them.
You really love him, don't you?
How about you and Helga?
"Who's going to do your laundry?
Nobody.
I'm all alone in the world!
What is the system here?
There's no system here.
Here, the wild disorder of genius
reigns.
What is this?
This is the Discos of Phaistos.
I've been trying to decipher it.
Is there a vacuum cleaner?
Or some buckets and mops?
Perhaps some soap as well.
You're not seriously proposing to
clean up in here, are you?
Why don't you go into town
for a couple of hours?
Well, yes, have it your way.
Provided you don't
interfere with anything.
This train was more comfortable
than my mother's.
Here, give me that.
Thanks, Onno.
So how was the trip, really?
This is going to sound strange,
but it was wonderful.
I'm glad I went.
And how have you been?
Deciphered the Discos yet?
No. I've been too busy.
My party nominated me to run
the social department of Amsterdam.
Can you imagine?
It's in the genes.
Seen much of Ada? How is she?
She's fine.
To the end of the past
and the beginning
of the beginning.
I've decided to ask Ada
to marry me.
I want a child.
A grandchild for my mother.
Do you think she'll say yes?
We always promised to
tell each other everything.
Well, Ada and I are in love.
If you draw a line connecting the
three towns my father grew up in,
they form a pure isosceles triangle.
The exact centre is Auschwitz.
Isn't that odd?
Max?
And my father was executed
on his birthday.
Funny, isn't it?
Since when?
Since you went away on your trip.
It just happened, really.
We're living together.
Isn't it the greatest courtesy
among friends to offer your wife?
- Good night.
- Good night.
Thank you very much. Bye.
Max!
It's wonderful to see you.
- Were you at the concert?
No.
It was beautiful. I'm actually
starting to enjoy music.
We're together again at last.
A letter arrived for you from Cuba.
I opened it by mistake, sorry.
Thank you.
It's in Spanish.
Let's have a look.
It's an invitation.
For you to play at a festival
in Havana.
What?
But it's three weeks old.
You'd have to leave in two days.
Why don't you come along?
Who?
Both of you.
What, to Cuba?
Why not?
You mean the three of us?
Yes. Why not?
If my father could see me now,
in the devil's own backyard.
Here's your key.
Onno Quist, Ada Brons
and Max Delius.
Passports.
- Are you Miss Ada Brons?
- Yes.
- Come with me, please.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
- Yeah, bye.
I can't find your names on the list.
No, we're ordinary tourists.
My girlfriend's playing cello
at the conference.
And what's your profession?
I'm a politician,
in the Dutch Socialist Party.
Then you have to register
over there.
Okay.
Onno Quist, Max Delius,
from Holland.
The official opening is
tomorrow evening, 9 o'clock.
So we're now the Dutch delegation
at the conference.
But that's irresponsible.
We'd like to know what classes
you'd like to see.
"The Urban Guerilla", "The Peasant
Role in the Takeover of Power",
or "The Armed Struggle".
"Armed Struggle", please.
Shut up! Do you want to
get us arrested?
Okay, huddle together.
Sit down on that stone thing.
I don't believe it.
Onno?
Bart Bork! Changing dollars?
This is yours.
Thought you'd come and make
money on the black market?
And you call yourself
a revolutionary.
Get out of my sight.
You hypocritical scum. Scram!
Before I call a soldier!
For the rest of my life
I shall look back on this day
with such joy
and deep satisfaction.
would like to dance with you.
I'm afraid I don't dance.
But I'd only like to dance
with you. Come on, it's Cuba.
I don't know the steps or anything.
I'll teach you. Come on.
I never thought I could do that.
As a delegado, like to see how
the wife of a guerilla lives?
I'd love to, yes.
Now?
The best cure for a hangover.
Last night was fun.
You're a good dancer.
I have to attend a session now.
I know. Me too.
"Armed Struggle".
The armed victory of
the Cuban people
over the Batista dictatorship
was not only the triumph
of heroism
but it also showed the capacity
of people to free themselves
by means of guerilla warfare
from a government
that oppresses them.
The Cuban revolution proves
that armed struggle
is the only way to
realize socialism.
Popular forces can win
a war against the army.
Our great comrade,
Ernesto Che Guevara,
is fighting right now
in the jungle to free
the oppressed people of Bolivia.
Now why does this fighter fight?
- Suits you.
Because he's a social reformer.
Shall we go?
Go? Go where?
You said you wanted to see
where live.
No, I have an appointment
at the beach in one hour.
It won't take more than that.
No, really...
Come on.
All right.
Hi, it's me. Do you mind
if I don't come along?
I'm about to go into a church
with the Virgin Mary.
You and Max go ahead.
It's your last chance.
We'll be back to Holland soon
enough in the rain and cold.
I'll see you later. Bye.
I'll show you the rest of the house.
Oh, good.
This is the rest of the house.
This is my bedroom.
To the memory of a happy past.
And an even happier future.
How much is this one?
It's for Onno.
I don't think Onno would wear that.
Okay.
Then it's for you.
Thank you.
Max?
Come into the water.
Ada.
There's something
I have to tell you.
No, really, I...
We can't do this.
We can't do this.
Now!
Now!
Guess what day it is.
It's your birthday.
I'm thirty-four.
Good God.
I'm older than Jesus Christ.
I have a present for you.
I'm pregnant.
Have you forgotten to
take the pill?
These pharmaceutical companies
are unbelievable.
If that baby is born,
I'll have it put in a shoebox
and sent to the company that
made that pill.
If we do have that baby,
we'll raise it with an iron hand
with the strict purpose of
honouring its father.
Onno,
- what do you really think?
- Are you serious?
Is it true?
I thought you were going to say
we'd have to get rid of it.
Get rid of it?
I could get rid of you,
but get rid of a child of mine?
A Quist? With my genes?
You must be joking.
Brace yourself.
1am going to be a father.
It's not true.
Itis. It's true.
It's absolutely true.
It's true!
What's wrong?
Onno, to be perfectly honest,
Ada...
was the only woman in my life
with whom the thought of
having a child didn't scare me.
Well, my child is your child.
Cosmic twins, remember?
If my arithmetic is right,
this must have happened in Cuba?
That's right. The last evening,
before we went back to Holland.
Are you sure you want it?
In principle I believe in
abortion until the age of forty
and euthanasia after
the age of forty.
But I'm prepared to make
an exception in this case.
We got officially engaged today.
The wedding is in two weeks.
~The 27th.
- My birthday.
I know. It just happened that way.
Well, cheers. To Ada.
To Ada. And to the brilliant unborn.
You want me to have an abortion?
What if you give birth to a carbon
copy of me? It'll be catastrophic.
Why?
You don't know who the father is.
I don't want to know.
You and Onno are the father.
Onno is my friend.
I have to tell him the child
you're expecting is mine.
You don't know that.
This will destroy your
relationship with Onno,
and my friendship with him.
This will destroy everything
between the three of us.
I got pregnant whilst
on the pill, you know that?
Well there you are.
You're as fertile as
the Virgin Mary.
Ada,
you'll do it.
Will you please stand.
Onno Cornelius Matthias
Christian Quist,
do you take Ada Maria Theresa Brons
to be your lawful wedded wife?
And do you promise faithfully
to fulfil the duties
that the law attaches to
the contract of marriage?
What is your answer to that?
What is my answer?
Let me think.
Yes. Yes, I do.
Ada Maria Theresa Brons,
do you take Onno Cornelius
Matthias Christian Quist
to be your lawful wedded husband?
And do you promise faithfully
to fulfil all the duties
that the law attaches to
the contract of marriage?
What is your answer to that?
I do.
I now declare you man and wife.
Onno, our friendship,
our twin-ship,
is the most precious thing
I possess.
However, I have forfeited the right
to say we are still friends.
Our friendship demands the truth
and the truth is
I betrayed our friendship.
I confess I failed.
I hope you find it in
your heart to forgive me,
though I will understand
if you don't.
Are you okay?
It's kicking.
Feel it.
This is your first visit
to Uncle Max.
Is it here?
- Yes.
Isn't it ironic?
The observatory's built on the old
Westerbork concentration camp.
Your mother could have been here.
So this is where Uncle Max thinks
he's going to discover heaven.
- Are you Mr. Quist?
- Yes.
An urgent phone call for you.
Turn the telescope
away from the wind.
We're already trying.
Have you told Onno yet?
No.
- And you won't either.
+ have to.
My conscience won't bear it
any longer.
Max.
Ada.
That was your mother.
Your father's had a heart attack.
It's very serious.
I'm sorry it's a bit bumpy,
but this is the quickest way
to the main road.
It's okay.
God.
Watch out!
It's too soon.
- No, men out of the car first.
Everyone all right?
We're going to have to push.
Do you want some help?
No, stay in the car.
Push, push.
Push.
Onno, the seat.
Now.
Ada?
Ada!
Ada!
Jesus! Ada! Ada!
Ada!
Ada! Ada!
I'm sorry, but you can't enter.
She's pregnant.
We know, but the mother is
our first concern now.
Oh my God! Ada's father.
Thank you, Onno.
See you tomorrow.
Ada's in a coma.
But the baby's going to be okay.
I'm sorry about your husband.
This must be awful for you.
Things go as they go.
Ada gave me this in Cuba.
won't disturb you any longer.
It's the middle of the night.
You can sleep in Ada's room.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's because of the way
you looked when you came in.
Like my husband when I met him
in the war, covered in scratches.
The statue gives birth to
a human being.
What are you whispering for?
Maybe she can hear us.
Listen, Ada. It's alive.
Our child is alive.
The news is not good, Onno.
Her EEG shows almost no activity.
I'm afraid the coma's irreversible.
And the baby?
I doesn't affect the baby.
Except it will have to be taken
by caesarean section.
You left your Cuban chain
at the house.
Onno,
we all agree that it'd be impossible
for you to care for this child.
Now, my wife and I
would be happy to raise it.
Our kids are almost grown.
We'd see it as a second lease on life.
We'd raise it like a real Quist.
Onno,
we would gladly take the child.
Charles has accepted
an ambassador position in Denmark
so the child would have to
move with us to Copenhagen.
But our children would love to
have a little brother or sister.
She's been in our prayers
ever since this awful accident.
Thank you for your kind offer,
but I want to take care of
the child myself.
Onno,
you can even do your laundry,
let alone change a baby's nappy.
Well, I can learn.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'll quit my job
and be a father to my child.
Would anyone like a ginger snap?
Son,
you are a politician.
The best one in this family.
One day you may be
Prime Minister.
You can't throw all that away.
This country needs you.
How do you propose to
raise a child?
During the meetings
of the Cabinet?
Visit the child when you like,
but don't mix up love and duty.
Let us pray.
Dear Lord...
Mrs. Brons?
- Listen, I've got...
- 'd rather not talk about it.
I need to talk about it.
I've never made love to
anyone like you...
Let things go as they go.
What if you and I
took Ada's child?
After all, you're the grandmother.
I've been offered an apartment
in a castle near the observatory
in the north of Holland.
You can sell the bookshop
and live there too.
We could raise the child together.
Say that again.
Your mother-in-law will move in
so your child would be in good hands.
Is this some kind of perverse joke?
I've never been more serious.
I don't understand.
What's happened to you?
I wouldn't stand one day
alone with that woman.
Is there something going on
between you?
Absolutely not.
You could come and visit
as often as you want.
Why would you do this for me?
So it's okay?
Well,
I suppose Ada would agree.
So this is how the 60s
are going to end, is it?
Everything changing.
You become a grandmother.
I become a father.
You're the only one not changing.
Typical Max.
It's a boy.
Those eyes. I've never seen
anything like it.
What's his name?
Quinten. Quinten Quist.
Isn't he an angel?
An angel indeed.
To our envoy.
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday, dear Quinten,
happy birthday for you.
Here.
Skeleton keys, real antiques.
Medieval locks.
These are his favorite pieces.
See that?
Now put it back.
- That's it, good.
Oh, yes.
And then...
Isn't it a lovely present?
Look at all these keys.
- Aren't you Prime Minister yet?
- Almost. Give us a chance.
Hi, Max.
Helga.
Yes, with my tail between my legs,
I told her I couldn't bear doing
my laundry one day longer.
So where's my genius son?
I've the perfect present for him.
Don't get your hopes up.
He didn't even look at
the tricycle I bought him.
Quinten?
Quinten?
Quinten?
I bought a present for you.
Let's have a look at it, shall we?
What have we got here?
There now.
That's an obelisk.
And this palace is the Lateran.
It's in Rome.
And this is the holy of holies.
The Sancta Sanctorum.
Onno, please.
He's only five years old.
He's twice as intelligent as
most of the clerks in my ministry.
Hello, Quinten.
I'm Auntie Helga.
Would you like some chocolate?
Come on, Quinten. Lunchtime.
Quinten.
Where are you?
Come, daddy. Come and have a look.
What...?
Where are you taking me now?
This is not for human beings.
People belong on pavements.
What are you doing to me?
We just don't have time for this.
That's an obelisk too.
What is this?
Deep Thought Sunstar.
A racehorse, daddy.
A racehorse?
Bury a racehorse, then throw money
at a monument for it.
Dead horses belong in
a glue factory.
Come on, it's time.
I'm Deep Thought Sunstar,
the racehorse.
I'm Deep Thought Sunstar,
the racehorse.
I sometimes worry about Quinten.
He only seems to be interested
in strange things.
Medieval architecture.
Painting, sculpture, books.
He's a genius.
Don't you think he should
have friends his own age?
You should know, you're more
his father than I am.
Just "cause I see him every day.
All right, rub it in.
Onno,
it's time.
Is mummy dead?
Her body's still alive.
But there's nothing else there.
Did I come out of her belly?
Yes.
So I came out of nothing.
Don't try to understand it.
It's not something anyone
can understand.
For God's sake, stay.
You stay.
What?
Quinten?
Quinten?
I want to get out.
I want to go to
the centre of the centre.
What did you say, mummy?
Why are you talking to mummy?
She spoke first.
Do you remember what
mummy said to you?
She wanted to get out.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Can I come and live with you?
Later perhaps, when you're older.
Promise?
I promise.
The centre of the centre.
The centre of the centre.
Our lives are in
the claws of God.
Stone Tablets.
Mama!
I want to get out!
I just want to get out!
Help me.
I want to get out!
I want to get out!
I want to get out!
Quinten.
Quinten!
It's time to get up.
Come on.
Hey, Max.
Hey, kid.
- Hey, grandma.
- Morning.
Quinten.
Do we really have to go through
this every morning?
I'll make it on time.
I always do.
Max,
do you know of a building with
an inside but no outside?
Not that I know of.
See you.
Quinten.
Quinten!
Max.
It's a bit rusty in there.
Feel the first spring.
That's right.
Feel it.
<Quinten.
Now then, gently.
Well done, Quinten.
Your headmaster called.
You missed classes again yesterday.
I haven't told grandma yet, but...
I didn't miss anything.
If you keep missing lessons,
I'll have to call Onno.
We're getting fed up with it.
You go to school, end of story.
< don't have to listen to you.
- Yes, you do.
You're not my father.
Mr. Kern?
Is there a building with
an inside but no outside?
I'm a sculptor, not an architect.
Who's this?
It's Moses by Michelangelo.
What's this under his arm?
Perhaps it's a pizza.
Selma.
Do you think he understands
the messages?
He's surrounded by the right people,
reading the right books,
dreaming the right dreams.
We need to be more specific, Angel.
What's this I hear about
you're refusing to go to school?
Why is this?
I only learn nonsense there.
Well,
sometimes the things one learns
that seem nonsense at the time
make a great deal of sense
later on.
Why should I care about later on?
Tell me what interests you.
Did you think about my question?
Well, actually,
the only building with an inside
and no outside in is here.
I bought this book for your mother.
Many years ago.
Quinten? Quinten!
Wait! Wait!
Wait! Dad!
Stop! Wait!
I want to leave.
Can live with you in Amsterdam?
I promise I'll go to school.
But I'm terribly busy.
But you said.
You said when I got older.
Things were different then.
I'm with Helga now.
I'll talk it over with her,
I promise.
Bye, grandma. Bye, Max.
- There's no reason for panic.
We still need him in the castle.
I can't do anything. He has
free will like every human being.
I don't care about human beings.
He needs to come back
to the castle. No matter what.
I'll let you know
the Council's decision.
I could quit my job
and be Quinten's wicked stepmother
for a few years.
God, I love you.
If Ada wasn't alive,
I'd ask you to marry me.
Careful, you'll get me killed.
Christ, a pack of journalists.
Good luck.
Give this kiss to Quinten
and tell him I'll be home
to celebrate his homecoming soon.
Why is the meeting
being held on a ship?
Possibly with a view to
avoiding journalists.
Do you have any idea why
the Prime Minister chose you
as candidate for Defense Minister?
I have a big mouth.
Everyone's afraid of me.
- Some Generals say they'll resign...
- Onno's on TV.
..if a radical leftist like
yourself becomes Defense Minister.
What's your reaction to that?
Let them. I accept their
resignations immediately.
The stars are calling.
Any of you fancy being a General?
Sophia, I won't be home tonight.
The future Minister of Defense...
I have a girlfriend.
Well, that's nice for you.
I thought I smelt
some different soap recently.
The Council's decisions are final.
It's not necessary.
Yes itis.
Something must be wrong.
They've conferred for over an hour.
Onno.
Helga!
Leave my car alone!
Helga!
Jimmy, can you give us
two minutes?
The shit has hit the fan, Onno.
Were you in Cuba in '67?
Yes.
Helga!
Helga!
Did you take part in
a revolutionary conference?
Get your hands off me!
Helga!
Helga!
Helga!
Can you imagine the front pages
with this picture?
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Dear Max,
we probably won't
see each other again.
Just know that
the memory of our friendship will
stay with me to my dying day.
Dear Sophia,
Il leave Quinten
in your capable hands.
Il be eternally grateful
to you for that,
Dear Quinten,
I love you. I love you very much.
Don't see my disappearance as
a denial of my love for you.
During the war
people went into hiding
from the Germans.
I have gone into hiding
from life itself.
Please don't try for find me,
because you won't.
I hope
that you can forgive me someday.
Your lost father.
Mama.
I miss daddy.
Go and find him.
Where?
Hi, Quinten.
How are you today?
Yeah.
Let's see how mama is doing.
Bye, Quinten.
Max. I'm going to look for daddy.
You'll never find him.
I'm still going to try.
You're still at school.
- I'm going to leave.
No, you're not.
Not as long as I'm your guardian.
I'm going to work.
Why don't you come?
We've linked our telescope to
a network of them worldwide.
We get the first results today.
Okay.
Max.
Max!
Max!
Max!
Hello.
- Hi, Max.
Hi.
Quinten called.
He said it was urgent.
- Hi, Max.
Hi.
Max, read this.
Sophia, Quinten called.
Is he there?
Yeah, I'll wait.
Hi, Max.
No, no, no.
It doesn't make sense.
Max, pick up the phone.
Maybe it's the telescope.
Could be concavity in the ground
because of natural gas under it.
Gas under a concentration camp.
If only the Germans had known.
I had the idea I was on
the verge of discovering heaven.
Max? Hello? Max?
Max?
Damn it, pick up the ph...
Where's Max?
He left with Ankie.
...two...three...
Leave it.
I'm much too old
to become a father.
No you're not.
We could live together here.
This could be your office.
What an awfully big shed.
It was an old barracks
in the concentration camp.
My father bought it for next to
nothing and rebuilt it here.
What is it?
You know...
it's possible my mother
was kept here
before being shipped to Auschwitz.
Isn't that incredible?
I have a feeling I can
see through these names
to what's beyond,
what happened in the past.
I've got it!
Of course!
What, Max?
I've got it, I've got it.
My calculations were right.
There's no bloody fault with
the telescope. It makes sense.
I can see through the Big Bang
to what's beyond,
to negative space-time.
Do you know what this means?
Do you know what this means?
Do you know what this means?
Max has discovered us!
That's impossible! Do something.
What?
- Anything.
Kill him. Kill him!
Kill him!
I've discovered you, you bastards!
Please. Please.
You're drunk. Come on.
t's the phone.
No, leave it.
No, please, I still need Max.
I know where you're hiding.
You can't hide much longer.
Please.
Onno!
Where are you?
I've found heaven, Onno.
I won our bet.
I found heaven before you
deciphered the Discos.
Answer the phone!
Max!
Max!
Maybe he doesn't want you
to look for him.
He didn't forbid me
to look for him.
He just wrote that
I wouldn't find him.
But I will, grandma.
Twill.
I'm afraid something terrible
will happen if you leave here.
Here, take these.
They were your grandfather's.
What do you want?
And in there stepped
a stately raven of
the saintly days of yore.
Edgar Allan Poe.
What has the world come to, Edgar?
This world without God.
Why shouldn't they cut someone's
throat for a car radio?
Are there no decent people anymore?
Maybe we can find one good person
in this world.
One good, decent person, Edgar.
Is it possible amongst
all this crowd?
Quinten?
Daddy?
How did you know I was in Rome?
I didn't.
I can't believe
we're here, together.
Maybe we aren't.
Yes, perhaps we're both having
the same dream.
How's mama?
Is she dead?
No.
Why didn't you leave an address?
If mama had died, we wouldn't
be able to contact you.
Why are you using that cane?
I had a minor stroke.
A brain haemorrhage.
There's nothing to worry about.
I found this stick in
an old antique shop.
As you can see...
I am almost fully recovered.
I don't exist, Quinten.
I once read about a man
without a shadow.
I am a shadow without a man.
Is Max in Rome, too?
Dear God.
When?
About a month ago.
How?
He was...
he was hit by a meteorite.
A meteorite?
Typically Max.
From now on
the world will always be
a Max-less world.
Only three more human days to go.
Everything is ready for Quinten.
We'll have the Ten Commandments
back on time.
This is the order of
a disordered man.
Still working on the Discos?
I've found a few words.
Why don't you move in with me?
You can stay as long as you like.
What do you think?
Good morning.
You slept well, I trust.
Good morning, daddy.
Four. Just like Max.
Max made better coffee.
Why did you bring this old etching?
I always carry it with me.
Daddy, where's the Piazza
San Giovanni in Laterano?
What's the matter?
I know these stairs.
Well, these are the Holy Stairs.
Taken from Pilates palace
in Jerusalem, or so they say.
Jesus walked down these stairs.
That's why pilgrims climb up
on their knees. Out of respect.
That's the Sancta Sanctorum.
The holy of holies.
Let's go upstairs.
You don't expect me to
get down on my knees?
No, there's another staircase.
"Nowhere in the world
is there a more holy place".
The Stone Tablets.
Come on.
This door.
Even the lock.
The centre of the centre.
I dreamed about them.
Come on, let's go and have lunch.
It's a curious thing, but...
"Holy of holies" never occurs
in the Christian religion.
"Where does it come from, then?
- Judaism.
The "holy of holies" was in
the old temple in Jerusalem.
What was inside?
~The Ark of the Covenant.
Where's the Ark of the Covenant now?
It disappeared when Solomon's temple
was destroyed by Emperor Titus.
What was inside the Ark?
The Stone Tablets with
the Ten Commandments on them.
Daddy,
what do they look like,
the Stone Tablets?
Come on, I'll show you.
A pizza.
I can't believe it.
Dad, dad.
The Ark has not disappeared.
The Ark of the Covenant is in
the Sancta Sanctorum in Rome.
Very clever.
But I think you're wrong.
This altar was opened on
May the 30th 1905
by a Professor Grisar
and he couldn't find a single...
Exactly 80 years ago.
Today's May the 30th.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen.
God, I'm such a lousy father.
Happy birthday, son.
I know what I want
for my birthday present.
Your help.
- My help?
To see if the Stone Tablets
are in the Sancta Sanctorum.
Grisar couldn't find a trace of
the Ark of the Covenant.
But did he look for
the Stone Tablets?
I don't understand.
Daddy,
the Ark may have disappeared
but the Stone Tablets still exist.
That's why the professor
couldn't find anything.
Professor Grisar
was looking for the Ark,
but he missed the Stone Tablets.
Quinten, you're not going to
do this, are you?
Sure.
Quinten, are you mad?
I've just been dreaming of
an ideal world
without sons who drive fathers mad
with their insane schemes.
Are you coming?
No, absolutely not.
I'm too old for all this.
They're closing, you know.
Are they? Thank you.
Oh, my God. Am I still here?
Quinten?
How in God's name
did you manage that?
Just take these.
The centre of the centre.
Give me some light.
You see? There's nothing there.
You were wrong.
No, dad. I know they're here.
They've got to be here.
What are you doing?
Hurry up, Quinten.
I don't like this.
I've got them, dad.
What? But that's...
But that's...
- That's impossible.
4 found them.
Well, let's see!
No time. Give me the case.
Let's see what's on them.
Later.
No-one will ever find these here.
Not in a million years.
Come on. Come on.
God forbid that these should be
Moses' tablets because
if they are, we should be
in such trouble.
If you don't tell anyone,
no-one will ever find out.
Now,
we wait for morning.
It'll be crowded, being Sunday.
What is it?
- I'm missing...
My walking stick!
I left it in the chapel
I left my tools in there.
We can't get back in.
We have to get out of here
before it's discovered.
I can't walk without my stick.
You should've been more careful.
We'll get you a new one.
I can't believe you, Quinten.
We risked our lives
for these damn stones
and now you seem to have
lost interest in them.
Because I know they're
the real thing.
They're just...
They're just stones.
Daddy,
those are the Stone Tablets.
If these were
the real Stone Tablets,
they'd be made of pure sapphire.
We'd be billionaires.
That's why we have to leave
the country on the first plane.
"Our lives are..."
And what if the first plane
is going to...
Zimbabwe?
Then we're going to Zimbabwe.
Come on, daddy.
OUR LIVES ARE IN
THE CLAWS OF GOD
Now this airplane's
the Sancta Sanctorum.
What on earth are we
going to do in Karachi?
There's a short stopover
in Tel Aviv.
Israel?
What are you planning to do there?
Give the tablets back to God
on Mount Horeb
and lead the tribes of Israel
back to Egypt
and close the biblical circle?
I don't know.
Our lives are in
the claws of God.
Shalom. Welcome.
1am Menachim Aron.
How many nights are you staying?
- Two nights should be enough.
Please register.
Then we're going back
to Holland, yes?
- Do you have a safe?
- Yes, of course.
Oh, good.
Quinten. Quinten.
Come here.
They found the walking stick
in the Sancta Sanctorum.
They think it's the rod
Moses used to part the Red Sea.
They think it's a sign of
Christ's return. Look at the crowds.
All the roads into Rome
are blocked solid.
And all the flights in, too.
Did you sleep well?
- Yes.
Well, I didn't.
What's in your backpack?
I got us some lunch.
What is it?
- Stone Tablets.
"What?
Stone Tablets.
My son is an artist.
These are atmospheric evocations
of the legend of the Holy Grail.
It's modern art.
All right, have it.
Thank you.
Quinten, are you crazy?
Lunch? You have no idea.
This is a religious time bomb.
Good morning. Do you speak English?
Yes.
- My name is Ibrahim.
I'm a poet. ['ve lived in
Jerusalem all my life.
Allow me to be your guide.
We have no need for a guide.
Could you please tell me
where Solomon's temple stood?
It was over there,
where the Dome is.
Jerusalem is a lovely place, yes?
Yes.
Quinten, please wait for me.
This is the place where Mohammed
rose to heaven.
He climbed up a ladder of light.
Did he die?
No, he dissolved in the light.
Since ancient times, for the Jews
this rock has been
the centre of the centre.
The centre of the centre.
In this stone,
heaven, earth, and underworld
come together.
Dad.
Dad.
That's where they belong.
You're not seriously suggesting
we put them there, are you?
Of course not.
The temple's too heavily guarded.
Slow down.
Where's the gate that
Emperor Titus went through?
Just down there.
I'll show you.
Wait.
That's the gate Titus went through
when he destroyed the temple.
It's called the Golden Gate.
It has to stay closed until
the coming of the Messiah.
The Messiah cannot go through there
because Muslims have built graves
on the other side.
The Messiah can't cross
that ground. It's impure.
Young man, don't go there.
It's too dangerous.
Stop!
Stop! Go back!
Back! Right now!
Quinten!
Go back, now!
Are you insane? Come on.
I forbid you to go on with this.
You're risking your life.
Listen to me. I'm your father.
You never were before.
I'm so sorry.
But please, let's get out of here.
We'll take them to
the Israel Museum.
The Israel Museum.
What have you done?
I'm not risking my promotion
because of your clumsiness.
+ don't know what to do.
I do.
We'll leave them in
the museum cloakroom,
book an early evening flight,
and then live together in Amsterdam
like a proper father and son.
Oh, look, ginger snaps.
Do you know,
my mother used to serve exactly
these kind of ginger snaps.
Ginger snaps.
I didn't hear that word
in a long time.
‘Ginger snaps'.
Have a good day.
Did you see the number
tattooed on her arm?
- There was a number on her arm?
Yeah.
There was an A...
3-1-4-1-5.
Dad, what's wrong?
Dad?
Quinten, that woman had your eyes.
Lapis Lazuli blue.
So?
If she had that number,
it means she was in Auschwitz.
Just like Max's mother.
Just like Max's mother.
Max's mother can't be dead.
She must have survived
the concentration camp
and be alive here,
in Jerusalem.
But how do you know?
It has to be.
That woman...
has your eyes.
What's that got to do with me?
Max wasn't my father.
Quinten!
Before your mother was with me
she was with Max.
You told me I was conceived
in Cuba.
It happened in Cuba.
Oh, dad.
It doesn't matter. It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Go and lie down for a moment.
No, not my father!
Please.
Please, not my father.
We never make deals with people.
Who do they think we are,
second-hand car salesmen?
Onno's death is not necessary.
Okay.
I'll do what you want me to do.
But don't kill Onno.
Edgar.
What do you want?
Deep Thought Sunstar.
No.
Don't, Quinten. Don't do it.
Don't go.
No, Quinten. Don't do it.
Don't go.
Please.
Quinten.
Quinten.
Quinten.
Quinten.
Quinten, are you in there?
Quinten, are you asleep?
Quinten, wake up.
Have you seen my son?
He must be in his room.
Open the safe now. Open it.
The safe hasn't been opened since
you asked me to put your stuff in it
an hour ago.
Mission accomplished.
I'm going to submit my report.
You? This was my assignment.
You were just a little cog
in a very big machine.
But what's going to happen
on Earth now?
Humankind is done for.
From now on Satan has a free hand.
Earth will soon be a living hell.
Then they'll wish they still
believed in us.
But if they found out
we got the Tablets back,
that the covenant has ended,
wouldn't that make them
mend their ways?
It's finished, Angel.
The assignment has ended.
"What about Onno?
- He must be eliminated.
No witnesses.
No.
We promised Quinten
to let him live.
Why don't you go down there
and save your Onno?
Twill.
But you know you can
never come back.
I'll go down!
As you wish.
No-one will believe you.
Finita la commedia.
Thank you for
your contribution, Angel.
I'll go down on Earth
and tell them what happened.
I will go down. I'll save Onno.
I will go down!
I will save Onno!
I will save mankind!
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
I will go down!
Do you hear me?
I will go down!
