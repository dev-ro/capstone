THIS STUFF IS GOING ON NOW,
AS FAR AS
PUBLICITY-WISE?
THEY'RE NOT
PUBLICIZING MY...

MARCH SOMETHING...
MARCH WHAT?
YOUR CONTEST
WAS MARCH 24th.
IT WAS LIKE, EARLY IN
THE BEGINNING OF MARCH.
AND IF SHE WINS THIS,
PROVE ME WRONG,
BUT I KNOW SHE WON
THE RACE EVEN IF SHE LOST AT THE NATIONALS.
BUT I'M NOT THINKING...
PESSIMISTICALLY.
I'M THINKING
OPTIMISTICALLY.
MY BABY GONNA WIN.
AND THE WORD COMING UP
FOR YOU IS "PLAGUE."
PLAGUE.
WOULD YOU GIVE ME A

A DESTRUCTIVELY
NUMEROUS INFLUX
OR MULTIPLICATION
OF A NOXIOUS ANIMAL.
PLAGUE...

MY BABY SPELL THAT RIGHT.
GO GIRL,

AT HER.
SHE CAN'T
BELIEVE HERSELF.
THAT WAS THE HAPPIEST
MOMENT OF MY LIFE.
I FELT REALLY GOOD.
I THINK I PRAYED.
I PRAYED THAT NIGHT ALSO.
I'VE BEEN PRAYING...
I THINK I'M A
PRAYER WARRIOR.
I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT
IT'S SOME REASON I JUST CAN'T STOP PRAYING.
Angela:
SO WHATEVER HAPPENS, I'LL BE HAPPY FOR HER.
AS LONG AS SHE
PLACE IN THE TOP 50.
BUT I WANT HER TO
WIN IN FIRST PLACE.
I WOULD LIKE FOR HER TO.
AS I GO HIGHER, MY
GOALS GO HIGHER ALSO.
AND SO, I JUST GOTTA
KEEP ON REACHING, KEEP ON REACHING.
SO THIS YEAR, I ROSE
ABOVE ALL OF MY PROBLEMS
AND I WENT STRAIGHT
THROUGH THE LOCAL,
STRAIGHT THROUGH
THE REGIONAL.
I WAS DETERMINED THAT
I WAS GOING TO WIN THE CITYWIDE SPELLING BEE.
I TOLD THE PHOTOGRAPHER.
HE WAS LIKE, "SO WHAT
ARE YOU GONNA DO WHEN YOU GET TO CITYWIDE?"
I SAID, "I'M GONNA WIN."
AND SURE I DID.
I WON CITYWIDE

NOW I'M GOING

WE DID ALL
THE WORDS
THAT WERE EVER
GIVEN TO SPELLERS IN THE COMPETITION.
WE COLLECTED THE
DATA FROM ALL THE PREVIOUS SPELLING BEES
AND SAW WHY
PEOPLE WERE FAILING ON CERTAIN WORDS
AND TRIED TO
CORRECT THAT FOR OUR KIDS.
SO TO DERIVE A
COMPLETE NUMBER WOULD BE HARD,
BUT I CAN TELL
YOU THAT IN THE FINAL DAYS OF THE COMPETITION,
WE'RE DOING
BETWEEN 7,000 TO 8,000 WORDS A DAY.
VERY GOOD.

WE GET THE
ROOT WORD,
WE TELL THEM TO USE
IT IN A SENTENCE,
WE TELL THEM TO
RE-PRONOUNCE THE WORD,
WE UNDERSTAND THE
MEANING IN OUR HEAD.
SAY THE SPELLING
ALPHABETICALLY INSIDE YOUR OWN HEAD.
MATCH IT WITH THE
SOUND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO COME OUT WITH
THAT YOU JUST PRONOUNCED,
RE-PRONOUNCE THE
WORD IN THE HEAD,

THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
THERE ARE 46

MY FATHER
WAS RIGHT ON THE STEPS

SPELLED THE WORD CORRECTLY,
HE RUSHED ONTO THE STAGE.
HE WAS NOT AN EMOTIONAL

EMOTIONAL THAT TIME.
IT WAS A BIG THING,
GETTING TO THE NATIONAL

HAD MADE IT TO THE
SECOND DAY OF COMPETITION,
GOT A WORD THAT HE
UNFORTUNATELY MISSPELLED,
AND THAT REALLY
BROKE MY MOTHER UP
AND SHE WAS CRYING
IN THE BALCONY.
AND I TRIED TO COMFORT
HER AND I TOLD HER,
"MOM DON'T WORRY. I'LL
WIN IT FOR YOU SOME DAY."

FOCUSED ON THIS
THAT THEY ACTUALLY SELECTED
FOUR PEOPLE TO LAY A WREATH
AT ARLINGTON CEMETERY
AT THE TOMB OF THE
UNKNOWN SOLDIER.
AND SO THEY CALLED ME
A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE THE CHAMPIONSHIP

YOU KNOW, "YOU'VE BEEN SELECTED.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE
THERE AS PART OF THIS?"

OPSIMATH IS
SPELLED O-P-S-I-
M-A-T-H.
[ Applause ]
Commentator:
NOW, THAT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MAKE NUPUR THE WINNER.
"LOGORRHEA."
Nupur:
LOGORRHEA. MAY I HAVE A DEFINITION?
PATHOLOGICALLY
EXCESSIVE AND OFTEN INCOHERENT TALKATIVENESS.
Nupur:
LOGORRHEA. MAY I HAVE A SENTENCE, PLEASE?
THE PATIENT'S
LOGORRHEA
WAS INDICATIVE
OF DEEP EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS.

SOMEHOW OR OTHER,
IN AMERICA,
SPELLING, ALTHOUGH IT'S A
FAIRLY MECHANICAL PROCESS,
IN SMALL COMMUNITIES
IT WAS IDENTIFIED WITH, YOU KNOW,
THE BEGINNING OF BEING
ABLE TO READ AND WRITE AND HANDLE LANGUAGE.
IN THIS COUNTRY,
SPELLING HAS ALWAYS BEEN A COMMUNITY PROCESS.
Dorothy:
WE TRIED TO RAISE HIM THAT...
TRY, AND IF YOU
DO IT, GREAT,
AND IF YOU
DON'T...
JUST ROLL ON.

OH, MY GOD. I'M SIXTH,
BUT I COULD'VE WON.
I KNEW THOSE WORDS THAT SHE WAS SPELLING.
DID YOU KNOW
THE WORDS THAT SHE GOT?
NOCICEPTOR
AND LOGORRHEA? YEAH.
YES. THAT'S
WHY I'M SO MAD.
I KNOW. I'M
JUST LIKE, "OH, I COULD'VE WON."
April:
SOME PART OF ME WANTS TO THINK
THAT I COULD HAVE
GOTTEN THAT WORD RIGHT,
AND IF I'D GOTTEN
THAT WORD RIGHT
THEN MAYBE I'D HAVE
A CHANCE AT WINNING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Gale:
THERE'S SUCH A THING, I GUESS,
AS COMING TOO CLOSE
AND YET NOT COMING,
YOU KNOW, CLOSE ENOUGH.
BUT THAT'S... THERE
HAS TO BE SOMEONE IN THIRD PLACE, RIGHT?

Ashley:
IF I LOSE,
IT'LL BE OKAY BECAUSE...
I'LL BE UPSET FOR
A LITTLE WHILE,
AND THEN I'LL
RISE ABOVE IT
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST
ANOTHER OBSTACLE.
IN AMERICA, BACK IN
THE 18th CENTURY,
PEOPLE HAD THIS
SENSE OF OPPORTUNITY.
YOU COULD LEAP OUT
OF ONE'S SOCIAL CLASS.
YOU COULD MOVE UP, AND
I THINK THEY UNDERSTOOD
EDUCATION WAS A
BASIC PART OF THAT.
Rajesh:
THE PROCESS OF GOING THROUGH SOME- THING THAT COMPLEX,
THAT HARD, AND YOU
STILL PUT IN ENERGY WITH A PASSION.
AND IF THEY CAN DO
THAT IN ANYTHING ELSE,
THAT THEY TAKE IN
THESE VERY QUALITIES
WILL MAKE THEM SUCCESSFUL
AND HAPPY AT WHAT THEY DO.
WHOOO-OOO!
[ Mooing of cows ]
I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD
DO THAT FOR MY FAMILY.
I DON'T KNOW
THAT I COULD SAY,
"WELL YOU KNOW, WE'RE
GOING TO ANOTHER COUNTRY
SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE
A BETTER WAY OF LIFE."
Angela:
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE OF MY BACKGROUND
THAT I WORK SO HARD.
Jorge:
HE HAS SAID THAT IF HE WERE TO DIE TODAY,
HE WOULD DIE
A HAPPY PERSON
BECAUSE HE FEELS LIKE...
WE HAVE...
ACCOMPLISHED WHAT
HE WANTED US TO.
OH, YOU WANT
TO TALK TO HER TOO.
WE'VE GOT
NUPUR-MANIA HERE.
I GO TO COLLEGE,
AND I WANT TO DO
SOMETHING IN NEUROLOGY.
JUST FORGET ABOUT ALL THE
PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE.
FORGET ABOUT ALL
THE OTHER SPELLERS...
SEE, RIGHT
NOW WE'RE SEEING VIDEO OF YOU COMING HOME,
AND YOU SAID
IT KIND OF SHOCKED YOU
HOW MANY PEOPLE
ACTUALLY SHOWED UP FOR THAT. YEAH. IT...
Meena:
YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF BELONGING IN AMERICA
OUTSIDE OF INDIA,
WHICH YOU DON'T GET ANYWHERE ELSE.
WE WANTED OUR CHILDREN
TO HAVE THAT.

LOGORRHEA:

Kimble:
THAT IS CORRECT.
