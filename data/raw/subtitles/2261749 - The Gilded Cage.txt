Maria knows I need her for\n"The two Cods"
-You're dreaming!
Your sister that hides the truth from you?
Now it's only one cod\n and not two.
And that cod looses the game.

We tell ourselves that...
this wall in 100 yeas\nwill still be standing.
And must protect the kids.
People will stay over them.\nIt has to be solid.
Not to let to happen\na misfortune.
In my home in my country...
A wall is usually one\nextra room in the house.
The family gets bigger.

Hmm... This wine is good!\n-Pommard 1979.
-In the year I arrived France.

One clause simply specifying that\nMr. Ribeiro will manage the works.
-There are more people for that job!\n-José you're the best!
-I want that shopping center...
...to be built by an artist.\n-Voilá!
-Oh yes.
-At the beginning you wash with a sponge\nvery hot water
and a little of white vinegar
and I've the habit of adding lemon.\nIt's my personal touch.
After we dry\nwith newspaper.
But the most important\nis to rub very well.
Like that: from bottom to top.\nBottom to top.
-Did you understand? From bottom to top\n-Yes from bottom to top.

-This Port is excellent! Isn't it José?\nIt's true!
-So cute our children together isn't it?\n-Yes.
When I see the dark circles in\nCharles's eyes arriving home...

Veal with rare vegetables.
Ladies and gentlemen\nhave a nice tasting.
Thank you Maria.
Charles do you know Portugal?
No. I'm counting on Paula\nto take me there.
You'll see you wont want to return again.
It's true\nPortugal is a very beautiful country.
But with the crisis there\nis better to stay here.
Did you ever thought about returning?
-Yes they expect to return.\n-What about you?

-We... Tell them we are from here.\n-Yes yes...
-We are in our country.\n-Yes.

Voilá "bràtch"!
It's good!
It's my specialty but I didn't know\nthat you liked. I'll take the cakes.

-It can be important.\n-I'll open.
-Let's see if it's important.\n-It was only missing me this one! Behaving as a doorman.

There is no "what".\nTake your hands. Good bye Madame.
Gosh!\nThis woman drives me crazy.
Imaculada...
There's a long while since I\nwanted to do this!
It's done you don't\nneed to do it anymore.
If you're looking for a substitute\nyou already have her.
Nice because soon\nit will be needed one.
Is this a diner or spectacle?
I'm sorry I'm leaving.\nCan't take it any longer.
Paulinha don't be rude.
Better being rude\nthan ridiculous mum.
Shut up!
I'm sorry. Forgot that we can't\nsay what we think.
Well be seen and not\nattract attention being unnoticed.
Letting yourselves be humiliated\nit's what you do better.
-I would say you like it!\n-Ungrateful.
I'm pregnant.
It's true dad.
Your dear daughter is pregnant\nand is not even married.
That's shameful.
Paula!
Paula hold on!\nHold on!
-It's not possible.\n-Stop.
-It wont be possible for both of us.\n-What?
What's our problem?\nListen me. Stop.
What are you afraid of?
Afraid I find out that\nyou are from a family of employees.
That you're a Portuguese with complexes.
-Is it like that you see me?\n-It's what you are!
Are you going to have a kid\nwith a woman like that?
Did you talk with your sister?
Yes.
I think we should leave her alone.
-She needs peace.\n-Peace? Needs peace?
Dad?
I'm not returning.
Let's go.
- Pedro how are you?\n-Fine.
Good morning I'm Cassiopêe\na friend.

-It's pretty your friend.
- Cassiopêe!
I'm leaving.
-Wait! Cass' Listen.\n-Lair. I behaved as an idiot.
Why did you lie to me?
Because... To please you.
The doorman you spoke with\nwas my mother.
Now don't you say anything?
All right.
Francis we are going to be grandparents.
Everything okay sweet?
What a diner.\nWe have a lot to talk.
I think so.
Dad why did you raise\nJosé's salary.
Because I thought he deserved it.
After so many year...
-Of course.\n-And also is going to be your father-in-law.
It's the family.
Tell me instead\nthat you knew about the inheritance.
You know that they are going to return
but you need him.
It's convenient to you that\nI date his daughter.
That way you keep José\nand the contracts.
You behaved well as\nan hypocrite last night. Congratulations!
Francis what's that about?\nWhat about you? Where did you learn that?
It's unbelievable! I never\nknow about anything in this house!
-Why? I don't know.\n-Mum it's not the moment!
-Sorry. It's complicated.\n-I'm used to it.
I would like to see\nwhat would you do.
If we were not signing this contract\nwe would close the company.
Since 2 years that there's no job.\nYou've to see the reality.
It's true. If that prevents José's return\nimagine that makes me happy.
-I didn't know.\nYou don't know everything.
What?\nI've done it for us. Dam it!
Didn't say anything.
It wasn't necessary to slap her\nin front of everybody.
Your daughter doesn't want to see us\nand she's pregnant.
And Carlos is getting worst.
I'll abandon everyone\nreturning to Portugal.
I can't take it anymore.
I've got to talk with my sister.
-What are you doing?\nI can't take it anymore.
-I's me.\n-Maria nice you called me.
-I was about to call you because of the signature with the bank.\n-Exactly. I'll go there now to see you.
What?
Don't come to see Carlos\nin this conditions.
-Why?\n-It's contagious.
He's going to quarantine.
Poor him he's there on the bed.
Suffering more every time.
If you saw him Maria...
-I'm seeing him.\n-How are you seeing him?
Moreover continues\nto play poorly.
How could you lie to me?\nAnd play with his health.
Is it sin? And you?\nYou planned to abandon me!
-You didn't tell nothing about the inheritance!\nYou did you know?
What do you think?\nEverybody knows!
The presents the architect...
And you? The salary increase\nand the boss's suit.
It was Santa Claus\nperhaps?
That's why you\npretended to be sick.
We want you to stay.
"Very good very silly" isn't it?
Let's go Zé we have\nnothing else to do here.
Are you happy?
Everybody knew.
Paula is right.\nThey're taking advantage of us.
Everything they want\nwe do without complaining.
Would you let your slaves to leave?
The lovely couple\nthat never says "no".
We were dumb.
We were clowns.
Do you know what do I want?
Want to talk with Mrs. Reichert\nand tell her all the truths.
To take her mother's dress\nand fill the windows with tatters.
It's what she deserves.
What? Tearing Reichert's dress?
Better than that!
Let's see who are the clowns!

-Let me! Leave!\n-You're going to be your father Charles!
I'll tell you something:

You miss respected me.
Yes yes this wall\nis great like that.
-Is there any problem?\nNo certainly not!
Any other question?
We have been always\ngenerous to you Maria.
Few bosses are that sympathetic.
And what did you\ngive me in return?
The repugnant spectacle of your\nhusband with my flowers.
Not even mentioning your\ncousin Mrs. Culada.
Are you talking to me about sympathy\nMadame Reichert?
After everything I did for this building\nafter all of this years?
I saw the little Bertrand born.
I cared of Mr. Zu while he was sick.
I cared of your plants\nas it was children.
Cared of this building\nas my own house.
After 30 years of this job\nI do it with pleasure.
It's my job\nso I must do it well.
I would like you to say:\n"Maria is a good doorman".
But you're a good doorman Maria.
I know I'm a good doorman
but for you I know that deeply me or any other...
...is the same thing.
Isn't it true?
I'm leaving.
I'll leave here my memories\nmaybe even my children.
Here it is Mrs. Reichert.\nI finished the dress that was your mother's.
I hope it is as you like.
Pedro hated this pants.\nDo you remember?
Keep them. Perhaps\nthey can fit the baby.
The baby wont even know\nwho we are.
We'll be far way.
Will call "grandma"\nto Mrs. Caillaux.
We'll be only at a distance\nof 2 hours of air plain.
But I'll not be there when he's sick\nor for taking him from the nursery.
I'll be to far away.
You'll be far away form those selfish people.
Soon\nwe'll be in our home.
And what will we do there just us\nlonely in that huge house?
We'll live!
Paula is right.
We don't enjoy.\nWe do nothing besides work.
Maybe it's what we like.
Don't you want to leave anymore?

Yes I know.
If you don't go I will.
All of my family abandons me.
I'll go alone.
