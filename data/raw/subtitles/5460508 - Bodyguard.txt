Owj Ans & Media Organization Presents
How long has it been?
Almost a week.
Why didn't you come sooner?
I was busy.
You work at night?
Both nights and days.
What do you do?
I'm in the Protection Unit
So you are a guard.
I'm a protector.
Bodyguard?
No, protector!
Doctor?
When can I sleep?
BODYGUARD
- It's changed a lot since I was here.
- It's changed a lot since I was here.
- The historical heritage has fallen into ruin.
It can be the pride of the region.
- But they've simply left it.
- But they've simply left it.
- It's really a shame!
If you order the reconstruction
of the castle...
...we'll rebuild it quickly.
We'll dig the floor and foundation...
...to assess the material.
Hurry!
Get it done!
Heidar to Elias!
- Heidar to Elias!
- Heidar to Elias!
- Come in, Heidar.
I told the pilot not to lose contact
with the second helicopter.
- Keep me posted.
- Keep me posted.
- Sure. Don't worry, I'm watching.
Careful, Elias!
- Watch everything well.
- Watch everything well.
- Sure.
Doctor?
Excuse me...
" No!
" No!
_ Why not?
People like it too.
- What do you say?
- What do you say?
- I didn't hear him.
But I think
we'd better leave quickly.
Doctor?
Here's a shin.
Wow, Doctor!
It looks good on you!
Heidar?
The pilot asks how long it will take.
- You look fat!
- You look fat!
- I'll call you.
You know them all.
No need for the vest.
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
- Doctor looks fat in this.
- Doctor looks fat in this.
- Obesity suits him well!
- Only a minute or two.
- Only a minute or two.
- Don't interfere! It is my responsibility.
People will realize
you're wearing a bulletproof vest.
It isn't wise.
Heidar, don't be so strict.
I like my life more than you do.
The old castle will be reconstructed
...by your capable hands.
So walk as if you are going to be...
...the future leader of the country.
Mind your step.
Excuse me, Doctor...
...if you wait here a little...
...we'll take a few good photos.
You, would you please move out of the shot.
So the inspection of the dried
Hamoon Lake was an excuse?
Don't be so pessimistic, Heidar.
Colonel!
But you didn't like the title.
Weren't we to return
to the airport directly?
Where did the castle come from?
I wanted to surprise the Doctor.
Doctor,
I am short of men here.
Think of me too.
I have a heavy responsibility.
His worries are justified.
We'd better go.
- Who's informed them?
- Who's informed them?
- They've found out 'accidentally'!
When such a big helicopter
lands here...
...naturally they'll come
to see what's going on.
- I can't control it
if it gets bigger.
- I can't control it if it gets bigger.
- Doctor...
...it's not a bad idea
to greet them.
- Right. It's rude to leave like this.
- Right. It's rude to leave like this.
- Doctor, I have only one man!
- Don't worry.
They're not strangers.
- Don't worry. They're not strangers.
- Maybe not for you...
...but they are for the Protection.
...but they are for the Protection.
- The Doctor considers it impolite to disregard people.
- These people deserve respect.
- These people deserve respect.
- It is a bit late for respect.
- Welcome, Dr Solati!
- Welcome, Dr Solati!
- Don't come close Careful, Elias.
By the grace are God
you're still young and energetic.
Why did you visit an empty castle
instead of our homes?
- I am humbled by your offer, but I was so busy.
- I am humbled by your offer, but I was so busy.
- Never mind, Doctor...
...what will you do about the drought?
- People can't farm without water.
- People can't farm without water.
- Don't come close!
With your support,
we will develop this region.
We showed our willpower.
When will you show yours?
You're right. We're here...
...to solve the problems together.
- Praise God for the health of our future president!
- Praise God for the health of our future president!
- Do you know that motorcyclist?
- Where? Who?
- Where? Who?
- The man who's coming.
His headpiece does not belong to our region.
Elias!
To the helicopter!
On the ground!
Scriptwriter and director
Ibrahim Hatamikia
Fereshteh!
Please get up!
OPEN your eyes!
She isn't breathing.
Hold her arm up.
Don't cry,
she won't die.
When will we get there?
We haven't arrived yet.
Sure.
Yes, call her mother.
What's happened to my daughter?
Mozhgan Salehi?
- Mrs Salehi?
- Mrs Salehi?
- Yes?
Ms Principal!
- My daughter?
Suicide?
- My daughter? Suicide?
- I'm afraid so.
- What have you done to my daughter?
- What have you done to my daughter?
- Calm down madam. We need to talk.
- Quiet please! You're in a hospital!
- Quiet please! You're in a hospital!
- Sure, doctor. I'll be quiet.
You must thank God
she isn't in danger now.
I'll close down that school!
Do you hear?
I don't know what you're doing
in that damn place.
I sent my kid there
to be educated.
By God I'll ruin you
if she loses even a hair!
Yes, darling?
When?
NEWSCASTER: based on reports...
...Dr Solati who was visiting...
...the drought-struck regions
near Hamoon Lake...
My God!
...was the target of a terrorist attack...
...while greeting the local population
in Baluchistan.
I'm coming to you live
from the airport...
...where Vice President Dr Solati
and his delegation have arrived.
They have all been severely
wounded in the terrorist attack.
Come, mother.
Careful!
Easy!
Doctor?
Do you hear me?
- We're almost there.
- We're almost there.
- Doctor!
Doctor!
Can he talk?
Doctor!
Can he talk?
Can you explain what happened?
As the Doctor's senior consultant...
I'm sorry.
I just remembered.
Public opinion is still skeptical
about your recent Free Zones court case.
Heidar!
Oh, thank God.
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- What's happened to your hand?
- Nothing, my dear.
I'm fine.
- Nothing, my dear. I'm fine.
- Your face!
Don't worry.
I'm fine.
.Dad!
- You OK?
- You OK?
- Yes, darling.
- Hello, madam.
- Hello, madam.
- Hello, Elias.
- What's happened to your leg?
- What's happened to your leg?
- It's nothing.
Colonel!
- Heidar!
- Hello.
Do you remember me from...
...the President's provincial trips?
...the President's provincial trips?
- Yes.
- Tell people what happened.
- Tell people what happened.
- I'm not permitted to talk.
- I'll get permission for you.
- I'll get permission for you.
- Talk to him.
You know they are not
permitted to interview.
Some of the wounded...
...say
if it weren't for the Doctor's bodyguard...
...the number of casualties
would be higher.
People have the right to know him.
That is a protector's job.
No need for thanks.
NEWSCASTER: on the trip to the poor areas
of Baluchistan...
...was attacked by an unknown
suicide bomber and...
.Mum, it's dad!
- Mum, it's dad!
...the bodyguard's quick reaction...
...minimized the number of casualties. But...
- Maryam! That's Elias!
...some of our compatriots...
...were martyred. And...
...some were wounded in the blast.
I'm coming to you live
from the airport...
It is auntie.
And Elias!
This is yours and this yours.
- Don't answer.
- Don't answer.
- Why not?
Father is fine. What else
do they want to know?
Pick up the phone.
Tell them dad is fine...
...mum is busy,
and she'll call you later.
- Don't you want to answer
your mobile?
- Don't you want to answer your mobile?
- Auntie!
Did you see dad on television?
Heidar?
Darling?
Why doesn't today end?
It has.
Listen and you'll hear it.
Get up.
My Heidar!
I wanted to give you this present
on the first day of your retirement.
But because of your selflessness
in defending the deprived Baluch people...
...I decided to give it to you earlier.
...I hope you like it.
Raziyyeh.
[Young Heidar with Mr Rajai]
[Mr Rajai, Iran's president assassinated
by western-backed terrorists in 1981 ]
I couldn't bring myself to separate you
from your family last night.
They're talking about you
everywhere.
You saved the day!
Heidar!
You are the pride of the Protection Unit.
Am I seeing things?
Or have you missed the bullseye on purpose?
What does your heart tell you?
My heart says: my eyes might fail me,
but Heidar won't.
Don't flatter me.
Why didn't you come to the office?
- Because I haven't written
my report.
- Because I haven't written my report.
- Why not?
I've been asking myself the same question.
Time is up.
I won't let them overlook
your bravery this time.
They must give your
outstanding promotions too.
Here's a pen and paper.
Stan writing before it gets crowded here.
I'll be waiting for you in the office.
IN THE NAME OF THE MARTYRS' GOD
Hello, Hajji.
Hello.
How are you?
Better. You?
Not bad.
Did you write your report?
Yes, I handed it over.
What did you write?
Whatever I'd seen.
What did you see?
Is it a test?
I want to know if you
wrote anything about me.
About you?
You were the star of the show!
I'm honored to be your apprentice.
Thank you)
Hajji-
Yes?
I call Maryam but her mobile is off.
So?
Maybe her battery is dead?
But I called her yesterday too...
...she rejected my calls.
...she rejected my calls.
- I'll ask her.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
My!
What tired eyes!
You should've rested.
- I was too excited to sleep after I saw the car keys.
- I was too excited to sleep after I saw the car keys.
- Really!?
I'm glad you liked it.
Does Maryam have her phone with her?
Yes, why?
Why doesn't she answer Elias?
- Untimely doubt.
- Untimely doubt.
- What does she doubt?
- Pull over!
- Pull over!
- Pull over!
- What?
Pull over, I said!
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- Sorry, madam.
Shut up!
Get lost!
Hurry!
Rascal!
What's the matter with you?
- Give it here.
- Give it here.
- Give what?
- What has he given you?
- What has he given you?
- Nothing!
Who is she?
We just wanted to talk.
She is our school principal.
- Where did you put it?
- Where did you put it?
- What are you looking for?
What's wrong with her?
What is she looking for?
Shut your mouth filth bag!
- Where did you hide it?
- Where did you hide it?
- What are you looking for?
What are you looking for?
I'll show you what I'm looking for.
- Think of your parents!
- Think of your parents!
- It was here.
- Think of your parents!
- Think of your parents!
- It isn't mine!
- You must be ashamed!
- Why?
Suppose they are your sisters.
By God they are murderers!
What is it?
Back off, old man!
Get lost!
He's a cop! Run!
Get up!
Get lost!
Let's go.
[Persian wild rue is burned
to protect against the evil eye]
Clean up your stuff.
I saw your mobile.
Go to your room.
We'll talk later.
What are you doing?
You weren't there to see
how great your dad was.
They'll curse you with their evil eyes.
Everybody was watching.
I'm choking, mum!
It's good for you.
Clean up your stuff.
What is Elias's fault?
Why don't you answer his calls?
Your mother says you've
set a condition for him.
Right.
Have you told him?
Not yet.
Maryam.
What's the matter my dear?
Talk.
Dad...
...I'm afraid of the day
I won't see you again.
- You can see I'm still with you.
- You can see I'm still with you.
- Thank God!
But who knows if the others
will be as lucky as you?
Have you set a condition for his job?
Or there is something else
I don't know?
Elias is a good boy.
My problem is his job.
When he proposed to you...
...he had the same job.
Why did you accept his proposal then?
- Your problem is something else, isn't it?
- Your problem is something else, isn't it?
- Why don't you tell your father?
- I don't want to hurt him.
- I don't want to hurt him.
- Then the next time Elias calls...
...tell him "no" and finish everything.
Maryam doesn't want her husband
to risk his life for someone else.
- That is his job, his belief.
- That is his job, his belief.
- Not his belief.
It is his duty.
- What's the difference?
- What's the difference?
- They are very different.
- I think nothing is worth dying for.
- I think nothing is worth dying for.
- Nothing!?
- Maybe Elias doesn't think like you.
- Maybe Elias doesn't think like you.
- All right then.
- He must choose
between his belief and me.
- He must choose between his belief and me.
- But you were raised by a father...
...whose job was his belief.
...whose job was his belief.
- I've always been proud of you.
Where?
At home or university?
I don't think it was necessary
for everyone to know my dad's job.
- I thought you'd grown up.
- I thought you'd grown up.
- I'm sorry.
I know life and death are in God's hands.
But all the worry is ours.
I don't ever want to go
to the airport to receive his corpse!
- You said Maryam loved Elias.
- You said Maryam loved Elias.
- Wasn't it clear in her words?
- Who must tell him now?
- Who must tell him now?
- Her dear father!
Hello.
Hello.
Please take a seat.
Would you read the bouquet's card
out loud for me?
I want to hear it.
To the courageous soldier
Hajji Heidar Zabihi...
...who defended the people and the
government officials with all his might.
Jalil Qavami,
Senior Consultant to Dr Solati.
- Congrats!
- Congrats!
- Congratulate whoever deserves it!
- And who is that?
- And who is that?
- Why have you dragged me here?
I want to give you the bouquet.
Thank you.
- Am I dismissed now?
- Am I dismissed now?
- No!
What is this report you've written?
I didn't know your PTSD
from the war had kicked in!
You found out a little late.
My brother...
My colleague...
My dear!
I'm arranging a dignified
ceremony to praise you...
...but the travelogue you've written...
...will destroy all your record and dignity.
- Do you understand?
- Do you understand?
- I know what I've written.
No you don't!
You'll be retiring in two months.
What's wrong with you?
I announce regretfully
and shamefully that I...
...as the chief protector of Dr Solati...
...should not have allowed landing
in the uninspected region.
I should have resisted their ungrounded
insistence with all my power.
My Lord! On judgment day,
how will I...
On judgment day, how will I...
...be accountable for the spilled blood of the innocent?
...be accountable for the spilled blood of the innocent?
- Heidar!
I want a technical report.
Not a will!
Where is the suicide bomber
in your report?
How much was his share?
Where did he come from?
How was he informed of Dr Solati's landing?
I want analysis.
I said my share.
The others must be brave
and say their share.
Why are you scoring an own goal?
- Because I am the main culprit for allowing it.
- Because I am the main culprit for allowing it.
- You had no choice.
It is customary.
All chief protectors know
they mustn't bicker with officials.
This report is no different from suicide.
It is a bomb!
This paper has more shrapnel
than the suicide bomber.
My hair's turned grey.
- I must think of my journey (to the afterlife).
- I must think of my journey (to the afterlife).
- Have a good journey!
But this report has incriminated
our whole team.
You don't want to be damned
on your journey, do you?
- Is that all?
- Is that all?
- I'll write it.
- Sign it too!
- Sign it too!
- I won't lie.
We're not supposed to say everything.
It is my duty to arrange a ceremony
in honor of your competence.
I think the President would like
to give you a medal of honor too.
Ashrafi!
You know when the suicide
bomber exploded, I was...
I watched the film 100 times.
I'd be suspicious if
it were anyone but you.
- But you didn't do it out of fear.
- But you didn't do it out of fear.
- Is it not an alarm?
Heidar!
- Why do you make a big deal of it?
- Why do you make a big deal of it?
- It isn't big?
No, it isn't!
They themselves are to blame.
We aren't robots.
We are humans.
Sometimes we feel well,
sometimes not.
- Sometimes zestful,
sometimes doubtful.
- Sometimes zestful, sometimes doubtful.
- But I made a mistake.
This is between you and your Lord...
...it doesn't concern the public.
Even if there is something,
you can repent.
My dear friend!
- We are becoming bodyguards, man!
- We are becoming bodyguards, man!
- The time wants bodyguards.
A bodyguard is a mercenary.
There is no belief in his actions.
The 80s are gone!
[Revolutionary Pictures]
It is the 2010s now!
[Recent picture]
Your dossier is full of complaints
from those you've protected.
You expect me to back down...
...when they treated their
protector like a footman?
To do their shopping
like a bellboy?
To watch his son and find out
who he goes out with?
Why his daughter...?
I've come here to defend
the system's officials.
To sacrifice my life for my belief.
If there is no belief...
...then no salary is worth my life!
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- You're back?
- You're back?
- We took them to the hotel.
I'm at your disposal.
I have two daughters.
And a son, Elias.
My mother always prays for you, sir.
When your mother first requested that
you'd like to be Maryam's suitor...
...nobody was as happy as me.
But Maryam has a condition now...
...and nobody is as unhappy as me.
...and nobody is as unhappy as me.
- I accepted her condition.
- You did?
- You did?
- Actually, that's what I was thinking too.
- So you want to leave.
- So you want to leave.
- Leave? Leave what?
The Protection Unit.
No.
She didn't say anything
about that.
What was it then?
She just told me to go back
to school, and I...
Oh, so that's what she meant by
"go back to school"!?
To leave the Protection Unit?
- Hajji, what should I do?
- Hajji, what should I do?
- You have the answer.
Your opinion
is very important for me.
Come here!
Help him!
How am I going to tell my brother?
Stretcher!
Good shower?
- Yes, thanks.
- Yes, thanks.
- Don't catch cold.
It didn't matter back then,
but now I think...
Dad?
Yes, dear?
Why doesn't Maryam
want to marry Elias?
You shouldn't eavesdrop.
If I were in her shoes,
I'd surely marry Elias!
Drink this.
You aren't worried about Maryam?
No.
I'm worried about you.
Help yourself.
Elias won't back down.
So you've under estimated your daughter.
I've been praying for them.
Elias is a good boy.
Shh!
Don't worry about such things.
Leave all that to Raziyyeh.
When you walk up the stairs
and reach the President...
...I want you to be vigorous...
...keep your chest out, so the
medal sits on its place well.
What's the matter?
You are happy your protector husband
is getting a medal...
...but you don't want Elias
to have my job.
I said "yes" to this young man
at the height of the war.
My parents disagreed and
thought I'd be widowed.
But they both respected
my decision.
Now I respect my daughter's decision
so she does the same to her daughter.
Yes?
Mum...
...we're done talking.
...we're done talking.
- I'll be there in a second.
You won't come to see him?
I'm seeing him every day.
As Heidar wishes.
Heidar 1, Heidar 2, Heidar 3!
Heidar 1, Heidar 2, Heidar 3!
We'll increase speed.
Heidar 3, don't provoke them.
Let them leave.
Heidar 1...
...on my back.
Careful.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- I'm Khalaj.
Chief of this organization's Protection Unit.
What was happening on the way?
News travels fast!
- Who were they?
- Who were they?
- Asking me?
They disgrace everybody.
Disgrace who?
Help the guests out.
What have you done to them?
Pardon?
You've made them angry.
Making them angry means
making the Europeans angry.
When the Europeans are angry,
the Americans will be angry too.
I don't give a damn.
You are?
Heidar Heidar, base!
Heidar Heidar, base!
Which side is Heidar on?
Are you a sincere revolutionary
or just a hothead?
Shouldn't you be getting back
to your desk?
Your boss will be worried.
Heidar Heidar, base!
Heidar Heidar, base!
Come in, base.
Please come in.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Welcome.
His larynx is hurt.
Don't make him talk.
- Hello, doctor.
- Hello, doctor.
- Hello.
I hope you're better.
It's very hard for me
to see you like this.
I wish I was on this bed
instead of you.
- I couldn't...
- I couldn't...
- Doctor, God willing, you'll be fine soon.
I'm sure you'll be back
to work for the people.
Everybody is praying for you.
I am certain
the prayers will make you well.
Mr Qeisari,
Security Council Special Inspector.
- He is chief protector of Dr...
- He is chief protector of Dr...
- Colonel Heidar Zabihi.
Hello
You were wounded?
It is nothing.
He is being modest.
His left hand was wounded.
Left hand?
I'm Ashrafi.
The Doctor would like to see you.
Yes.
Col Heidar Zabihi's commander.
- Yes, you are?
- Yes, you are?
- In cinema...
...they called it an usher.
Someone who sits people
in their place in the dark.
Hard job!
We had sat in our correct seats
before the start of the film.
Your mobile number, colonel?
-0...
-0...
-912...
7162490.
Is that right?
- Hajji Heidar Zabihi
obeys his commander's orders.
- Hajji Heidar Zabihi obeys his commander's orders.
- I wanted to assess your cooperation.
Dear Hajji Heidar Zabihi...
...my chief protector!
I appreciate your bravery...
...and I will thank you admirably
when I can talk.
Dr Solati.
Bravo!
What's the matter?
You're worried about this inspector?
Worried about the Doctor?
You heard his written message.
What's the matter with you?
Leave of absence.
- I want to take time off!
- I want to take time off!
- Leave of absence ?
All right,
take a few days off.
Not a few days.
How long?
Until my retirement.
Retirement?
- Heidar!
- Heidar!
- You hear me!
You know how much I care for you.
I know what your remedy is.
A parachutist who's become afraid...
...must jump again before it is too late.
...must jump again before it is too late.
- No.
I can't any more.
Why not?
I can't protect politicians any more.
My God!
- What is going on in your head?
- What is going on in your head?
- Can't you see?
- Now I understand
the meaning of your letter.
- Now I understand the meaning of your letter.
- Then give me the leave...
...so nobody will hear my voice.
...so nobody will hear my voice.
- Taking leave is not the way.
It is the only way I know.
You haven't doubted everything,
have you?
I don't know!
You don't want
to protect politicians?
I'll send you somewhere
with no politician.
I'll pray for you.
I'll pray for you.
Please.
You work here?
Wherever there is work!
Mr Khalaj is not coming?
He is.
You look familiar.
Have we met before?
Your memory is full too soon!
I remember someone taunting
me about being a hothead!
I remember that.
I mean further back.
You don't have anything to do?
There is a lot to do,
if the Caucasians stop bothering us.
May I ask how old you are?
Suppose I am
your father's younger brother.
[Pictures of assassinated nuclear scientists on the wall]
Good Hint! Now l recognise you.
Good for you!
Now get to your work!
I'm Engineer Meisam Zarrin.
You're going to be my
bodyguard from now on.
Won't you introduce yourself?
I'm Heidar Zabihi.
What should I do because
I don't want to have a bodyguard?
I don't want
to be a bodyguard either.
Interesting!
Then why are you here?
I was told
I'd be protecting a scientific figure.
Protector or bodyguard...
...what's the difference?
- The difference is the person we protect.
- The difference is the person we protect.
- I don't get it.
It means we don't protect just anyone!
- He must have character.
- He must have character.
- Character!
Having character means
being religious or humane?
Both, God willing!
It means if he is eliminated...
...the system will lack something.
Luckily I'm not that person!
Not being haughty
is a sign of good character.
I wasn't being modest.
I consider myself
higher than that character!
These things can't be proven by words.
They must be seen in action.
I don't intend
to prove myself to anybody.
It was a pleasure meeting you.
You made a hasty decision,
Engineer.
I have a fundamental problem
with anyone watching me.
Goodbye.
- Hello, Mr Zabihi.
- Hello, Mr Zabihi.
- Hello.
Did you see our genius?
He hasn't had a protector before?
He didn't want one.
It'll be impossible
if he doesn't want one.
Impossible or hard?
Hard.
Please.
Mr Khalaj...
...I know politicians well.
But these scientists play by different rules.
Right off the bat,
I've been mocked!
We have produced many politicians
in the past 30 odd years.
If I was the enemy,
I would never think of eliminating them...
...because we have lots of people
to replace them.
But from millions of Iranian youth...
...only a few are like Engineer Meisam Zarrin.
A real prodigy-
Important figures of the modern age...
...are such gifted scientists.
[Taking notes about the neighborhood]
The gun...
...arming and aiming...
...I must pull the trigger now.
Shall I?
Meisam!
Won't you introduce yourself?
You're worrying the lady.
OK, I'll introduce you.
He is my imposed bodyguard!
Mr Heidar Zabihi.
Now that I know
you've been following me...
...and now that I've trapped you
in this dead end...
...and aimed at you...
...will you grade me please?
What's my grade, master!?
If I had wanted to kill you,
I'd be home hearing about it on the BBC by now!
Simple as that?
Simple as that!
If you don't care about yourself,
think of the others in your car.
I almost killed you!
It was my own fault.
I should have removed the bullets.
Why do you have a gun?
. I'll explain.
- I'll explain.
- What do you do?
I'll explain.
Why would they appoint
a bodyguard for a university professor?
NUCLEAR ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT
The core of...
...U-236...
...creates radioactive uranium.
The reaction yields...
...two new radioisotopes
or fission fragments plus...
...200 MeV of energy.
This energy can be useful,
or in the form of...
...gamma rays, x-rays...
...and...
...neutrinos.
- Where are you going, Ms. Salimi?
- Where are you going, Ms. Salimi?
- Excuse me, I'm not well.
I'm not well either.
But I can't explain these again
after class.
The 200 MeV is a meager sum.
To produce...
...1000 megawatts of electricity
by a reactor...
...fission must be repeated
10 to the power of 15 times per second...
...inside the heart of a reactor.
NEWSCASTER: The special representatives
of the President...
...visited Dr Solati and the Baluch victims
at the hospital...
...and were briefed about
their health and treatment procedures.
The President's representative denounced
such vile terrorist acts...
...by extremists...
...and emphasized the need for a
thorough investigation...
May I?
Please.
You were my professor's bodyguard?
Professor?
Dr Solati was my professor.
Pity he left the university
for a career in politics.
Yes.
We must pray
for his full recovery.
Sure.
I don't know deciphering,
but it seems...
...the last person you protected
is in the hospital now!
Well?
- Have they exiled you here or were you promoted?
- Have they exiled you here or were you promoted?
- Guess.
Be a little honest with me.
I don't feel like explaining.
Good!
And I wouldn't want a bodyguard
with that record.
I've kept my distance from you.
No amount of distance
between us is enough.
I was commissioned to protect you
because you are an asset for this country.
Really?
Do I have a share
in this "asset" as well?
Your hide-and-seek game
has disrupted my personal life.
May I?
- You've invited yourself to join our conversation?
- You've invited yourself to join our conversation?
- What's the matter, Engineer?
Don't ask me to repeat it.
The bullet that passed here
could have passed here.
- He shouldn't be armed.
- He shouldn't be armed.
- You distracted me.
- Mr Meisam...
- Mr Meisam...
- Engineer Meisam.
OK.
Engineer.
I hadn't ridden a motorcycle for years.
- But I've done that for your convenience.
- But I've done that for your convenience.
- If my convenience matters to you,stop this!
- Stop this sir!
- Stop this sir!
- OK.
He'll stop his work.
Is that good?
He won't bother you again.
Mr Zabihi...
...I have men for protection here.
You are here because
my colleague Mr Ashrafi wanted it...
...unless you yourself want to quit.
...unless you yourself want to quit.
- You just fired me.
I just made your job harder.
Are you man enough for it?
It's not good here.
Stand across the street.
Yes sir.
Can I have a word with you?
. Now?
- Now?
- I'll be quick.
- Amir, take the motorbike.
- Amir, take the motorbike.
- Yes sir.
Would you like to help me
with Maryam's condition?
Everything has a price.
Some are hasty
and get swindled.
Some are clever
and buy at a good price.
Seems you aren't worried at all.
I am, but not as much as you.
It will be over soon.
But I think it is just the beginning.
What kind of job is this?
Instead of being proud of it...
...you are hiding it from me
who is going to be your wife.
Why don't you look at me
when you talk to me?
Sahar!
I'm not doing anything wrong.
Just like a teacher who has
a second job after class.
That teacher has financial problems.
Do you have the same problem?
- The wedding has its costs.
- The wedding has its costs.
- Meisam, I am serious.
Your question is really funny.
I wonder what is strange...
...about a university professor
doing research in his free time?
Other professors don't have bodyguards.
It was taken care of.
No bodyguard any more.
You are erasing the question
instead of answering it.
If having a bodyguard is a necessity,
not having one is dangerous.
But my problem is...
...why are you working somewhere
that endangers your life!?
You have heard the answer
a million times from the media.
You said you hated politics.
I'm not doing anything political...
...it is scientific.
You'll become a pond
in their political games.
OK.
I'm a pond.
What is your solution?
Tell me...
...what should we do?
- Let's leave this country.
- Let's leave this country.
- Where to?
Somewhere...
...we can walk together
without fear...
...and think about our future.
Somewhere we don't have to hide
in fear of being killed.
By God it is my dream to do my research
beside you in serenity.
- But where is that place?
- But where is that place?
- If you say so...
...they will invite you most willingly.
...they will invite you most willingly.
- They can't buy me out.
- They know your value.
- They know your value.
- OK...
...what is my price?
...what is my price?
- I don't know.
Ask your friends
who have emigrated.
They have their own price.
I haven't auctioned myself yet.
You'll have to sooner or later.
You're the only person
forcing me right now.
I'm not afraid of the one
who wants to kill me...
...but losing you would be unbearable.
...but losing you would be unbearable.
- I'm saying this for your own sake.
We're not safe here anymore.
You'll have to accept to have cameras
even in your bedroom.
Your phones will be tapped.
It will be so difficult to socialise with friends
and relatives that they will leave us...
...and we can't leave the country.
We'll be like the exiled.
Iran will become like a cage for us.
Who's told you all this?
I've thought about it myself.
- Who did you consult?
- Who did you consult?
- Are you doubting me?
No. Ask your consultants
how much the price of their freedom is.
I don't know!
I just know that I neither can,
nor want to be like your mother.
- I'll give you a lift.
- I'll give you a lift.
- Won't you finish your coffee?
No.
I miss my mother!
Return to the Protection Unit.
What about this genius?
We'll see.
I'll be there for him.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Dad?!
Won't you come in?
No, Hail-i-
Here you are.
Rest a bit.
- Go in peace.
- Go in peace.
- Goodbye.
Why doesn't dad come in?
- Please, Heidar.
- Please, Heidar.
- Hello.
Hello.
- Why are you so wet?
- Why are you so wet?
- I went to the pool!
My God!
- We have guests.
- We have guests.
- Who?
You must see her.
Get changed.
Get changed.
- He'll be a minute.
- He'll be a minute.
- Hello, Mr Zabihi.
Hello.
Mrs Zarrin?
Long time no see!
What a memory!
See?
He is still smart.
But I don't think
he remembers my son.
Your son?
Meisam?
Well done!
Meisam Zarrin?
Engineer Meisam Zarrin?
The boy you protect.
Engineer is Seyyed Mirza's son?
I found your address with difficulty.
There is a lot to say.
We must sit and talk...
...and Heidar must get changed.
No, it is late.
I've come because of Meisam.
Sure.
What can I do for you?
Coincidentally, I heard from Meisam
that you protect him.
- Meisam has recognized me?
- Meisam has recognized me?
- Yes.
From this photo.
We have one too.
Everybody in the photo
has a copy.
Remember the signatures
on the back?
Yes.
We promised each other...
...that whoever was martyred
would intercede for the others on judgment day.
That promise lacks something.
You didn't discuss
the duties of those who stayed.
Brother...
...I gave my youth for
Seyyed Mirza...
...and I'd give my life for his son.
Thank God
he can now make his father proud.
But I'm afraid they might
take him from me too.
I haven't come here to complain.
I've just come to say...
...not to get tired with his son's bitterness.
- [ Gesturing obedience] Certainly.
- [ Gesturing obedience] Certainly.
- Thank God!
I can sleep in peace now.
You are leaving?
- It is late.
- It is late.
- Won't you stay?
Heidar?
I don't want Meisam to know,
I was here.
Rest assured.
God be with you.
Goodbye.
- Stay more, Mrs Zarrin.
- Stay more, Mrs Zarrin.
- Thank you.
- After so many years.
- After so many years.
- Thank you.
Ali, get UP-
- Follow him.
- Follow him.
- Get off.
I have a visual.
This genius is playing
hide-and-seek with us.
Don't back down.
Do your job and don't nag!
I saw him.
He's playing with us!
He disappeared again.
Elias, Abbas, Ahmad.
Bad news!
Engineer Zarrin won...
...Heidar's squad has lost despite
a three man advantage.
He's already home!
End of the corridor on the left.
It is the child who lost his eye.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Please accept my humble gift.
- Please accept my humble gift.
- Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you, Doctor.
Forgive us.
We weren't good hosts for you.
It isn't worthy of you.
Hello, Doctor.
- Hello. Welcome.
- Hello. Welcome.
- Hello. Here you are.
The student has become the master!
Sit, dear.
How are you doing?
Where are you working now?
I'm sorry, I mustn't be seen.
Mustn't be seen?
Yes, Doctor.
Don't let them take photos, please.
Yes, Doctor?
Tell them to delete...
All of it?
All right, don't worry.
Thank you.
Don't, please.
So you mustn't be seen.
Yes.
It means
you've reached high places.
Thank you.
I was always proud of you.
But politics took you from us.
No, Meisam.
I am a soldier.
I stand guard
were they tell me to go.
God bless you!
Where are your bodyguards?
You'll be surprised to know.
Heidar?
Yes.
Heidar Zabihi?
Great.
Doctor is fine now
and I must tidy up my room.
Would you like to see
what I've collected?
I am at work.
I thought you'd come
to visit the Doctor.
Close the door.
I can hold an exhibition
with these photos.
And call it, Heidar...
...Hero of the Bygone Era.
You must be happy
Dr Solati is fine.
You aren't happy?
I'll be happy when...
...the truth is as clear as this screen.
What are you looking for?
You!
I was right there, sir.
So why weren't you martyred?
Martyred?!
- Are you joking with me, or with the martyrs?
- Are you joking with me, or with the martyrs?
- Don't evade the question!
If you suspect me...
...request an expert opinion to see...
...whether what I did was right or wrong.
They wouldn't understand...
...what I'm after.
Tell me what you want
and I'll help you.
Heidar Heidar, Ashrafi!
Why aren't you on, Heidar?
Report your location.
I invited him for a short chat.
Is it a personal or official invitation?
I have nothing personal to say to anyone.
My men are not allowed
to talk to anybody unofficially.
Please request officially...
...with seal and signature.
Will you?
I know some shrapnel...
...is still near the Doctor's spleen...
...and he is going to have
a hard and dangerous operation.
So what is this show for?
Dr Solati wants to see you.
What are you worried about?
You, obviously.
Don't worry, I'm fine.
Thank God!
Sit then!
I must go to the genius.
Never mind him.
You'll return to Dr Solati.
- What?
- What?
- Sit down.
You said you are fine?
Why do you want to ruin it?
Because Dr Solati likes you.
He was telling me...
..."I'm not dead yet and want my chief protector?"
- And you accepted?
- And you accepted?
- Yes.
I have my own problems.
I can't bicker with people all daylong.
- But I told you everything.
- But I told you everything.
- And I helped you.
Now it is your turn to help me.
- Then let me choose my last mission.
- Then let me choose my last mission.
- Last mission!
I've heard this genius kid
has had his way with you.
You like him humiliating you?
I'm just finding myself...
...let me choose this last one.
...let me choose this last one.
- Heidar.
Your photos are
in the inspector's room...
...he is after you.
...he is after you.
- Ashrafi!
No.
- It isn't to your benefit.
- It isn't to your benefit.
- My benefit?
My benefit...
...yours, the Unit's.
The Doctor's benefit too.
Who knows?
He might become the president.
So what?
What does that have to do with me?
You thought I want
to become his minister?
I'll overlook this snide remark.
I can't come.
You're disobeying orders.
Look how many stars are left...
...you strip off the rest!
Heidar!
Come back!
I must talk to you.
Heidar!
Heidar!
Look at me!
Heidar!
Calm down!
It is over.
It is over.
Raziyyeh?
I'm here.
Look at me.
Next stop, Tajrish.
Hello, madam.
Hello, Mr Zabihi.
What a coincidence!
Come in, mother.
This is not a coincidence.
It is called
following and protecting...
...but it's become
following and pestering!
Meisam!
I'd come to Seyyed Mirza...
...to complain about your son.
I'll tell you...
...because Seyyed has invited you too.
He doesn't consider me...
...worthy of following him.
...worthy of following him.
- Don't say that, sir.
See, dad?
See, dad?
They don't let us be alone
even in this cave.
You are late,
Mirza's friend!
You are late,
father's friend!
Meisam!
You were too busy to
see us grow up.
He is here now.
- Why don't you let him protect you?
- Why don't you let him protect you?
- I've come all the way on my own...
...I don't want
to be indebted to anybody.
- I asked him.
- I asked him.
- You shouldn't have.
For your mother's sake.
Don't say no.
The Seyyed Mirza we knew...
...was very forgiving.
Meisam is forgiving like his father.
Meisam!
My presentation today is
on the uncertainty of parameters...
...in the modeling of the Bushehr
Nuclear Power Plant.
Why have I chosen this topic?
Because boosting the safety of this power plant
and other reactors is very important for me.
As we all know...
...many parameters are significant
in the analysis.
These parameters...
...are so important that
if they are not properly controlled...
...they can cause a catastrophe.
They can increase...
...the maximum temperature of the core...
...to the melting point...
...or the explosion point.
- Are you ready?
- Are you ready?
- Yes, Heidar.
I'm very busy.
But it is necessary for you.
I know this game.
If your protection team
is going to be smaller...
...you must be a pan of it too.
Oh, mother!
I wish I'd gone mute
and hadn't asked...
...if you remembered
Heidar Zabihi!
What would you tell your father
if he was sitting in my place here?
All I have from my father, is a picture,
and the many stories my mother has told me.
Just suppose.
I'd tell him...
...the girl who was sitting
in your seat left me...
...as soon as she found out
my life is in danger.
You are an oaf, boy!
Is what I'd say
if I was your father!
I'd say: "That girl was sitting in your class all day.
How come you don't understand what that means?"
- Well, she is my student.
- Well, she is my student.
- Student?
She was staring at you
for two hours!
I can't believe you
if I don't see it in your eyes.
What about now?
Maryam!
He'll be upset when he wakes up.
She is snoring so loud!
NEWSCASTER: The Vice President
who had been wounded...
...in a suicide attack in Baluchistan last week...
...was martyred at the hospital today...
...despite the doctors' efforts.
A number of our Baluch compatriots...
...were martyred in the attack too.
At ease.
Sorry!
Do your job.
I saw this instant
in the films and photos.
Show me the moment of the blast.
Well?
The Doctor was struggling...
...and I was watching the attacker.
When he shouted...
...I knew it was a sign...
...and aimed at his forehead.
What was the Doctor's position?
I couldn't see his face.
When I noticed the attacker fell down
but didn't explode...
...I was watching around because
they don't usually attack alone.
I was looking around
when he suddenly exploded.
[Heidar praying behind Ayatollah Khamenei]
I think...
...it was like this.
Mr Heidar!
The way I see it...
...you used the official
as your shield.
We are talking about...
...a bodyguard who had to sacrifice
his life to save the official...
...but used him as his shield...
...to protect himself
in time of danger.
This is a big crime,
Mr Zabihi!
Why are you quiet, Heidar?
- They are questioning
your lifelong service.
- They are questioning your lifelong service.
- Mr Ashrafi!
Brother, you are going the wrong way.
Heidar's generation knows no fear.
Heidar is as fearless as
the terrorist who attacked him.
The key to the blast is somewhere else.
We must look for the key.
The owner of this mosque (God)
is witness that you did all that you could.
I'll wait for you here.
Go!
Hello.
If I'm going to sacrifice
my dearest asset...
...my life...
...I must know the reason.
You didn't realize the reason
all the years you were being paid?
Getting paid!?
- You mean banknotes?
- You mean banknotes?
- No!
Getting paid with the honor of protecting
the system's officials with your life.
I've been chief protector of
more than 100 officials so far.
I know very well what the system is,
who's an official...
...what is sacred,
what is not sacred.
My dear!
Times have changed.
Your duty hasn't changed.
We'd better say
you have changed, colonel.
When in time of danger...
...you sacrifice what is sacred,
instead of being sacrificed for it...
...it indicates a son of
ideological weakness.
It means danger for the system!
That is very unfair.
Heidar has saved many lives and
has been thanked by every single one of them.
Heidar is neither the first...
...nor the last person.
OPEN your eyes!
I'm afraid of the day
that this ship is pierced.
Mr Ashrafi!
I need to talk to you.
Hello.
Hello.
You've been suspended.
Until it is resolved,
you can't retire...
...nor can you go to work.
Can I get out?
I'm sorry again.
Nothing can be done.
- I want to get out.
- I want to get out.
- You can't get a taxi here.
Heidar.
All right!
You must have some nerve to come here!
I don't have such willpower.
I saw your student.
You know she is here?
Congratulations!
This oaf knows a trick or two.
Heidar!
Your gun.
I thought it over.
I want to quit.
You worked so hard and went through so much,
and this is how they thank you.
I won't let my daughter marry a man
who makes his job a plaything of his wife!
I must see your mother.
Don't tire yourself...
...I told her what's happened.
No, I must talk to her.
OK.
Folk song: Heidar Baba, the world
has become a falsehood, a myth, a fib...
...whoever entered the world
left it without success.
Heidar Baba, the world
has become a falsehood, a myth, a fib...
...even the long lives of Noah
and Solomon ended...
...whoever entered the world
left empty handed.
Even Plato was left with nothing.
The world has become a falsehood...
What happened?
Bomb!
A bomb!
Open the door!
- Open the door!
- Open it!
Open it!
Bomb!
Open it!
Open it!
Bring the extinguisher!
Hurry!
My head!
Heidar!
Heidar!
Heidar Baba...
...the world is a lie...
Why are you watching?
Call an ambulance.
Heidar!
Heidar!
Why did you do this?
Why?
Your father...
...would have done the same thing.
Heidar!
Sahar!
My Heidar!
Don't move me.
. Easy-
- Easy.
- All right.
I'm sorry.
I hurt you a lot.
Heidar!
Don't talk.
Don't talk.
I am with you.
You'll get well.
Do you hear me?
My Heidar!
- Raziyyeh?
- Raziyyeh?
- Yes, darling?
Yes, darling?
I want to sleep.
Heidar!
Don't sleep!
No!
Heidar!
Heidar!
Wake up!
I beg you, don't!
Don't sleep!
For Raziyyeh's sake, don't!
Let me sleep a wink.
Heidar!
Don't sleep!
Remember you said...
...you'd retire...
...and we'd grow old together?
- Have you forgotten?
- Have you forgotten?
- Raziyyeh?
Darling?
I'm cold.
