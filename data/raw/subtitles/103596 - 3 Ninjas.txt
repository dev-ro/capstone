I want to do it!
No, I'm supposed to!
Get out of here!
Would you guys shut up?
Just go.
Last summer looked like
another great summer
with our grandfather.
Me and my brothers...
My brothers and I.
Whatever!
We spent most of our time
training to be ninja masters
at our grandpa's cabin.
Yeah, when most kids are
at some stupid camp,
my 2 younger brothers... and I...
Studied with our
Japanese grandfather.
Most mornings began
the same way.
He'd wake us up with
a different test,
which I was always ready for.
So was I.
- So was I!
- Yeah, right!
Grandpa's a kind of a
goofball in a way,
but when it comes to
martial arts and stuff,
he's pretty cool.
Yeah! Like he'd slaughter
50 guys in 2 seconds.
Shut up. You shut up!
Just go!
We've been training since
we were really little.
You're still really little.
Jerk!
With all our ninja training,
we thought we were
ready to be ninjas.
Well, it's a good
thing that we were,
because that was the summer
that we would never forget.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Heh heh!
Hyah!
Hyaaah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyaaah!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyaaah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Ooowww!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Whoa!
Yoo-hoo! Up here!
Ha ha ha!
Grandpa, how'd you do that?
Next time, try attacking
in a nonsmoking section.
Man, we almost had you.
Yeah, we almost had you!
Had me? Ah, Michael!
What? If I hadn't stopped the car,
you would've been
called pancake by now.
Heh! You would've stopped.
Ok, guys, what now?
Let's attack him again.
Ah! 2 lessons you have to
learn from this battle.
Number 1... never attack
unless you're gonna win.
And lesson 2?
Don't climb a tree
that's full of thorns.
Ooh!
Ok.
Grandpa, where'd you
get that ugly mask?
This mask my father gave to me
on my day of names,
and I will continue this
tradition with you.
The day of names?
We've already got names, grandpa.
Ah, you may have family names,
but not ninja names.
All right... Samuel.
Sir.
From this day forward until forever,
you shall be known as Rocky,
because you are strong, solid,
and cool as granite rock.
Awesome. Yes.
Jeffrey. Ah, you are fast and free,
spirit of the young wild horse.
You shall be known as Colt.
Colt?
Humph.
That's cool.
What about me? Can I
be Monster Destroyer?
Or how about Super Killer?
How about Super Dork?
Shut up, spaz.
Little one,
since your energy begins and ends
with your tummy,
you shall be known as Tum Tum!
Tum Tum!
Ha ha ha!
I can't wait to
show these to dad.
He'll hate 'em.
Grandpa, will our dad be home
tomorrow when we get back?
Well...
He's a busy man...
In a very troublesome job, Tum Tum.
We're almost there.
Hyah!
On time, as promised.
It is a pleasure to do business
with you, Mr. Snyder.
Now, on behalf of the
people of my country,
I would like to say
You're under arrest.
Freeze, Snyder! FBI!
Heh heh heh heh!
Hold your fire!
Give it up, Snyder!
You got nowhere to go.
A surprise. Heh heh heh heh heh!
I love surprises.
Heh heh heh heh!
The FBI! Whoo! Heh heh
heh heh heh heh heh.
Nice of you to drop in.
Freeze!
Get up.
On the wall.
All right, freeze, Snyder!
It's over! Heh heh heh!
Don't move a muscle!
I'd love to stay and chat,
but I've gotta fly.
Ha ha ha!
Sam!
Agent Green is ok, and
we got everything.
We got guns, the mortars.
It's like a warehouse for World War III.
We got it all!
We got nothing! I want Snyder!
He's everything! I want him.
I gotta go. Bye!
I hear they almost got us, boss.
Me! Got me, brown. Not us.
My skin was on the line today.
That was Sam Douglas,
for god's sake.
I knew him when I worked
with Mori Tanaka.
That FBI guy is a ninja, too?
Are you kidding, huh?!
Douglas despises martial arts.
That little jerk is married
to Mori Tanaka's daughter.
Our luck old man Mori went
and married his daughter
off to a fed, huh?
Mr. Brown, this afternoon,
we pay my old friend
Mori a little visit.
Heh!
Right.
Look, I'll have them
home for dinner tonight.
Ninja training is good for the boys.
Grandpa, who's this in the picture?
It's your grandmother.
Ok, ok, but...
No, whose hand is that?
I'm talking to your mother.
I know your husband hates it, but...
Ok, Jessica, I may be wrong,
but he should spend more
time with his own children.
Food's coming!
Ugh!
Oops.
Colt, what is a ninja?
A ninja is one who can use
everything around him
to trick his enemies.
He is fast,
and he is friendly to his environment.
A ninja is honest and good.
His mind, body, and spirit are one.
He has self-control.
He has discipline.
A ninja loves nature.
Uh, 'cause he's part of nature.
Uh, a ninja never fights a
battle if he cannot win.
A ninja...
Mind, body, spirit,
heart are one.
And never use your power
on anyone weaker than yourself.
Hey, almost everyone is
weaker than me, grandpa,
and slower.
Don't be overconfident.
Yeah, don't be overconfident.
Ok, grandpa.
All right, give me your hand.
Love and trust be one.
Just as a rope of one
strand can be broken,
a rope of 4 strands
no enemy can break.
Whoa!
Grandpa, who is that?
Stay here and eat.
Grandpa, what's going on?
Rocky, let me see!
Get off! Shut up!
Act like ninja, not little babies.
What did I do?
Hyah!
Ow!
Hyah!
Ayah! Aah!
Hyah!
Ayah!
Come here.
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Face!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Aah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Aah!
Hyah!
Yes!
Come on! Grandpa!
Go sit down.
Heh heh heh!
Well, you're looking good.
You passed my little test, partner.
Snyder.
The only mistake I ever made
was being partners with you.
Your mistake was quitting.
You made a fortune on
those karate studios.
Phht! Blood money.
Come on. Heh heh.
You're living in this junky place.
And obviously you can't
find many students.
I mean, look at these 3 runts.
They are not students.
They're family.
Well, maybe they'd like to work for me.
I teach ninja,
not murderers.
Look...
I want you to train my men.
As you can see, they're
kind of helpless.
Hmm? You get back into training,
and I'll pay you a fortune. Huh?
Hmm?
Is that all you want?
Actually... no.
It's your son-in-law Sam Douglas.
Get him off my back
for a couple weeks,
for his sake and yours,
not for mine.
Or else you not only lose the money,
you may also lose a son-in-law.
And who knows?
With Douglas out of the way,
there may be no one left to defend
the honor of your beautiful daughter.
Heh heh heh!
You are getting slow.
Old man, take the money.
Talk to Sam Douglas.
Get him out of my life, hmm?
Or I will rip out your heart!
Boys, come here.
Attention!
Sir!
Who told you I needed your help?
I thought I told you
to stay in the house.
A ninja shouldn't be
overconfident, grandpa.
That's true.
Come here. Ha ha ha!
Oh, that's awesome!
Quiet, boys.
Sir!
Before I show you this,
you must promise me
you will not use this knowledge
unless you're in severe danger,
that you can only,
only use this technique,
to save your lives.
You promise this?
Sir!
There are a few places on the body,
that if you hit,
the person will remember nothing,
except how much it hurts.
You can be sure the person
will not want to continue the fight.
Heh heh heh.
Rocky! Sir.
I want you to hit right there.
Ayah!
See, see? Ah, now,
I want you to hit right there.
But, grandpa, that's the same spot
oh, no, it isn't. Now hit!
Ayah!
You see?
Nothing.
A half an inch between life and death.
Now, I want you to hit
here... here...
here... here...
and here.
I want you to practice
for one hour,
and then we'll go back to the city.
But, grandpa...
One hour. Now practice!
And what was with that
guy in the white suit?
I don't know. From the way
he acted with grandpa,
I think the whole
attack was fake.
Man, those swords
were real, buddy.
I still don't know.
I think he's just an old
friend of grandpa's.
He didn't look very
friendly to me.

No, but I'm gonna kill you

Jerry, remind me we got

And I need that ballistics report.
Hey, guys. How was your
summer with grandpa?
Great! I want to show you a
lot of stuff we learned.
Look, Jeffrey, show me
that stuff later...
It's not Jeffrey. It's Colt.
Yeah, and I'm not Sam.
I'm Rocky.
Michael, you're Tum Tum?
Yeah. You see, I'm Colt 'cause I'm fast,
he's Rocky 'cause he's solid,
and he's Tum Tum 'cause...
He'll eat anything.
I won't eat dog poop.
It's bad enough he's got you
doing karate all summer.
What, they need new names?
I like my new name.
Sam! Come on, Sam.
We gotta roll.
Look, boys, I gotta go.
I'm glad you're back.
Don't forget to kiss your
mother hello, Jeffrey.
It's Colt.
Hi.
Hi.
Did I hear your new name is Rocky?
Nah. It's just a new
name my grandpa gave me.
I like that name. It's cute.
Uh... I gotta go.
Yeah. Me, too.
Yeah, me, too.
Bye.
Hi, mom.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hi, mom!
Where are you going, huh?
Let me down! I'm sorry.
Hey. I think you're gonna
make a great ninja warrior.
Whatever.
You think being a ninja's hard work,
try being a mom.
Mr. Brown,
I want you to snatch
those 3 little kids
and hold them as insurance
till the deal with
Colonel Farouk is done.
Huh?
Douglas doesn't dare touch
me if I've got his kids.
You should've grabbed them
when you were up at the cabin.
Unh!
But I guess you
knew that already.
Snatch those kids
without getting caught,
or I'm going to crush your head
until a slimy ooze comes
out of your eyeballs.
No problem, boss. I'll
get right over there.
Mr. Brown! Yeah?
The feds have us all under surveillance.
Every move we make, they're watching.
We need some outside guys. Hmm?
Uh, if I may suggest, Mr. Snyder,
3 guys who did some... Some
messenger work for us a few times.
My sister's kid and his buddies.
Th-they're terrific.
Make the call.
Tell me. Have they studied
the masters of our eastern
philosophy like our other men?
Well, I... I don't know for sure.
But I know they do a lot of reading.
I must say
I would most certainly
consider getting radical
on some lonely, misbegotten
beach with this babe.
She is beauty for modern man to enjoy.
Dude!
Hey, amigos!
This is no library.
You buy, or you go.
Oh! My apologies, my good man.
Hammer, go score the
frozen fruit concentrate
and those gnarly little snack cakes.
No sweat, dude.
Cool. Marcus, score some nacho chips
and some radical salsa.
Dude.
None of that green stuff.
Dude!
And you, my good man...
Open up the cash register.
That's right, dude.
Us 3 boneheads are sticking you up.
Dude!
Now open up that register
before I have to get nasty.
Blam! Blam! Blam!
Excuse me, sir,
could I please use your telephone?
Mr. Festin.
Good. Listen, I want you
to drop what you're doing.
I got a job for you and your boys.
You have my undivided attention, sir.
All right, listen. We want you
to snatch a few kids for us.
Would these be, like, any kids,
or do you have some
specific ones in mind?
They're 3 very specific little boys.
You got a pen?
Here's the address.
623 North Pacheco.
That's 623. You got that?
Cover his ears, dude.
Ok. You remember 6.
You remember 2. I'll remember 3.
Pacheco. Ok, I got it, sir.
We'll get right on it.
Festin, don't screw this up.
Or we'll have to kill you.
Bummer.
Radical.
We got a job, dude?
Dude. Dude!
Your boys'll take care of the kids.
Then I'll put the screws on Douglas.
Mr. Brown, fax Colonel Farouk
and tell him we can ship
the missiles in 2 days.
God, I love being a bad guy.
Ha ha ha!
School bites it.
I want to stay with grandpa.
Yeah, me, too.
Would you guys shut up?
Mom'll hear you.
Oh, say hi to your girlfriend for me.
Yeah, say hi to your girlfriend for me.
She's not my girlfriend, ok?

on the top of that file.
What time are you
guys coming home?
Late.
Now you be good, ok?
Guys! Guys, check this out.
This is the guy from yesterday.
He's the one dad's after.
Grandpa is friends with a criminal?
No way.
Yes way.
It says so on the back.
"Hugo Snyder... Business
associate of Mori Tanaka."
That's grandpa.
Do you think grandpa's
a crook, too?
Oh, come on. No way.
But it says he's friends with that guy!
And we saw him joking around
with grandpa yesterday.
We gotta tell dad.
We can't tell dad.
If he knows that they're still friends,
he'll never let us see grandpa again.
I can't believe grandpa's a bad guy.
He's not.
Is he?
Ok, dudes,
operation Kick Butt is about to commence.

What time is it?
I don't know. Anybody got a watch?
Awesome!
So like, fester,
how are we gonna get
into the house, dude?
That's a very good
question, O Gnarly One.
Dude!
It seems that Providence has shined
her lovely light upon us, boys.
It's pizza time.

Rocky, are you there?
Hello? Is anybody there?
Hellooo.
Rocky, is that you?
It's Emily.

Then we felony.
Guys...
I've got some good news
and some bad news.
The good news is
the delivery guy
just creamed the baby-sitter
with the pizza.
Awesome!
The bad news is they're carrying guns.
Ok, ok, don't panic.
We'll call the police.
Duh. There's no phone in here!
Um... Emily. We'll call Emily,
and she'll call the police.
Hold it! Rocky...
This could be our chance.
If we can take these 3
robbers ourselves...
Then maybe dad will see
that our ninja training's worth it.
Yes!
Should we do it?
Let's murdelize 'em.
Hyah!
Hey, man, this kidnapping
is so much better
than armed robbery.
Dude!
Yeah, I never got a pizza on a robbery.
Dude.
I know, and it's good 'za, too.
Hey, you know, we should
save some of this
for the kids we're napping.
Dude.
They're probably pretty nice kids.
Where are all the weapons?
The slingshot? The knife throwers?
Dad hid 'em.
He doesn't want us messing with 'em.

against those guys with guns?

Tum Tum, you've got the kitchen.
Check.
Now, guys, prepare for phase one.
Dude!
Open the box.
Look inside.
Hey, dudes, check it out.
Go, tum, go.
Yeah.
Hey, found one.
Oh, no.
Robbers.
Robbers?
I thought we were kidnappers.
We are.
Dude.
Hey!
Good luck, Colt.
Whoa.
Ok, little dude.
We know you're in here somewhere.
We don't want to hurt you.
We just want to kidnap you.
Ha ha.
Come here, you little idiot.
Little kid, come here.
Kid.
Hyah! Hey!
Dude, dude! It's me!
Oh, dude, you're right.
I'm totally sorry.

Just stop it. Stop it, shh.
Where's that kid?
Ha!

Dude?
No.
There's no possible way
he could be downstairs.
Uhh!
Dude, what happened?
You hit me!
Hyah!
Hyah!

It's bad news already.
Ohh!
Ohh!
Where are you, you little dude?
You're gonna get it so bad.
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Ohh! Hyah!
Hyah!
Get off!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!

Hyah!
Uhh!
Dude. Dude.
Tum Tum, you ready?
Almost.
Ohh!

Dude...
This'll scare him.
Ha ha ha.
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
You guys ready?
Yeah. Ready.
My... ahh!
Nah-nah!
Hyah!
That's enough!
It works.
Oh, dude! Serious burnage.
Come on.
Sorry if it stings!
Where's the sink?
Where's the sink? Ohh!
Are we winning?
Ok, phase 2.
Hold it. Before phase 2,
I've got a little surprise.
What's that stuff?
Remember last year when you were sick
and you couldn't take a dump
for 3 days?
Yeah.
Well, this is the stuff
that makes you have to go.
Instant diarrhea.
You're sick.
Not as sick as they're gonna be.
Move over, man! I'm hurting!
Uhh! Uhh!
Mmm!
Stuff is good!
Give me that! Hey!
Dude!
Those kids, man...
I'm really going to...
Injure them.
Mission accomplished.
Ok, guys, phase 2?
Phase 2. Phase 2.
Dude! Dude!
Where... is fester?
Eh...
Dudes! Dudes, bail me out.
Help.
Help.
Help.
Hel... ow! Oh! Ah.
Nasty.
Ack! Other... other one.
Other one. Other one. Ack!
Oh... ah!
I say we kill those little boogers.
Eh heh!
I thought we wanted them alive.
I want us alive, dude.
Those little kids are dangerous.
So what's the gag?
We go to their room, and
we find their fatal flaw.
Man.
Hello. Hello.
Check one.
Ok, calling all cars.
Calling all cars.
Be on the lookout for us.
Thank you very much.
I really think we'd love to...
Rocky?
Rocky, is that you?
Whoa! Dudes!
Dudes!
Come here! Come here! Come here!
Uh, come over.
Come to the front door
of my house right away.
What's going on over there?
Come over. It's important.
I'll be right there.
Awesome! Dude.
We've got those little dudes now, dudes.
Yeah.
Well, let's go.
Well, forgive me for
being so supportive of my father.
It's my Asian side, I guess.
Well, great. So why are you giving
your husband such a hard time?
Well, that's my American side.
That's very funny.
Look, we'll be home in 10 minutes.
I'm gonna talk to the boys about it myself.
Well, they're probably asleep now.
Look, Sam, they love what
they do, and they love him.
Sweetheart, all I'm trying to tell you
is that someone could get hurt.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Rocky?
Mrs. Douglas?
Ha ha ha!
Shut up.
Ok, boys... Hyah!
We're comin' in,
♪ and we've got a little surprise for you ♪
Ha ha ha...
Ow!
Ahh...
Ok, dudes,
party's over.
Put that stuff down.
Heh heh...
Hey, fester, buddy,
I'm not feelin' so hot.
Dude.
What's wrong with you dudes?
We're almost outta here.
Sorry, fester, dude.
I gotta take a major dump, big time.
Dude! Hey! Hey, hey!
Ok, none of you little dudes move
until those 2 dudes get back.
Now...
I'm gonna ask this question once.
Where is your little brother?
Up here.
Hyah!
Aah!
Ow! Unh!
All right, Emily.
No sweat.
Are we winning?
Let's finish 'em.
Hyah!
Uhh!
Oh! Ah, it stinks.
Man, that reeks. Ah!
Hyah!
Ahh! Not the stomach.
Not the stomach.
Hyah!
Thanks.
Ahh.
Ahh. Oh.
Oh.
Hyah!
Aah!
Hyah!
Aah... oh!
Hyah!
Whoa!
Oh!
No! No!
No, no. That's the diarrhea cup.
Emily, are you ok?
Yeah.
I'm really sorry about all this, ma'am.
Are you ok?
Eh...
I'll go get the napkins.
I hope you saved some pizza for us!
Grrr...
Who are those guys, anyway?
Probably burglars.
Don't worry, ma'am. We have
the situation under control.
Right on. Yep.
We can take care of ourselves.
Ohh...
Ohh...
Grrr...
Grrr...
Hello, kids.
We're all gonna go for a little ride.
Eh...
Yeh-ah!
Arrrrr!
Would you like me to drive?
Excuse me.
Uncle, can I get paid?
Oh, brother.
No match at all.
Believe me, Sam. We're
doing everything we can.
Look, it's not enough, all right?
Where's Fitzpatrick?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
There is nothing else.
Mrs. Douglas?
Not now, Emily.
Ms. Douglas, I know where the boys are.
I was told to give this to you.
Emily!
Sam?
Call him!
Come here.
Snyder took the boys.
What? Yes.
"And lay off Snyder..."
All right, honey, it's ok.
It's all right.
Don't worry, now. We're gonna get 'em back.
Don't move!
Wait! Wait! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire! It's my father-in-law.
What are you doing here?
I came to check on the family.
Daddy, Snyder took the boys.
Snyder!
I'll get the boys back for you.
What, you? Oh, come on, Mori.
Sam, Snyder's got a ship in the harbor.
I know, berth 6.
How did you know?
I'm a ninja. I could hardly follow him.
Simple. We followed you.
Ok, ok.
In Snyder's heart, he's still a ninja.
It will take a ninja to break him!
Oh, come on, Mori. We don't
have time for ninja games.
I'm not playing games.
Look, give me 10 minutes.
I'll have a hundred men there.
Stop it! Both of you!
Now, this is about the boys!
Sam, my father is a very special man.
Now, you read the note. If Snyder
sees you, he may hurt the boys.
Well, what if he sees him?
No one will see me.
I don't know.
Sam...
Give me one hour.
One hour?
Mori...
We both hate Snyder,
and I know that we both love those boys...
So now I'm... I'm trusting
you to bring them...
Bring them home.
Sam!
Sam, we just got a report
on Colonel Farouk.
I'll be right there.
Mori...
Mori?
Mori?
I told you he was special.
I hope so.
Rocky, these ninjas have guns.
Hey, if they have guns, they're no ninjas.
Hey, and if they fire off the guns anyway,
the police'll hear.
Oh, that's reassuring.
Guys, we have to stick together.
Let's go, you little twerps.
Huhh!
Push it... one. Huhh! Huhh!
2... Huhh! Huhh!
3... Huhh! Huhh!
4! Kat one... Huhh!
Huhh! Huhh! Huhh!
2, 3, 4! Huhh... Huhh...
1, 2, 3...
4!
Huhh... Huhh...
1, 2, 3, 4!
Kata 1, 2, 3, 4!
Kata 1, 2, 3, 4!
Kata 1, 2, 3...
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hy-hy-hy!
Hey, Colt, does this style
look familiar to you?
It ought to.
Your grandfather was Snyder's teacher.
Grandpa.
Kata 1, 2, 3...
This sucks.
This really sucks.
I'm hungry.
Great.
Why don't we just eat our way outta here?
Colt, chill. We'll get out.
We'll probably starve to death.
No one is gonna starve.
We gotta get outta here so we
can help grandpa when he comes.
Grandpa?
Rocky, you musta been hit
in the head too many times,
'cause grandpa is one of them.
He's a ninja. Grandpa will come.
I don't care who he is, as long
as he brings something to eat.
Would you guys get a clue?
Grandpa isn't coming.
He sold us out.
Uhh!
Hyah!
You know, Colt, sometimes
you can be a real dork.
It takes one to know one, jerk.
Hey, you guys, look!
What? What?
My scab came off.
Hey, what's the matter with us?
Don't you remember what grandpa said?
"Everything around us
can be our friend.
Be friendly to your environment.
That is the ninja way."
Ok. All right, Rocky, so
what are we supposed to do?
Are we gonna go make the
friendly door open?
Hey, Mr. Door, how ya doin'?
Will you be my friend and open up for me?
No?
Tsk! You know what?
I think we're out of friends in this room.
Come on.
I know there's a way out.
I know it.
Rocky, would you give it up?
We're dead. That's simply it.
We are dead.
He's right, Rocky. We're goners.
What are you doing?
Can you order pizza on that phone?
Shh!
Hello. Security.
Uh, yeah. I'm in the kids' cell.
Can you call me back?
I wanna test out the phone.
Rocky, you're crazy.
Just watch.
Hello?
This is a phone check.
Is that you, Frank?
Wait, wait. You must mean the guard.
Hold on.
It's for you.
Uhh!
Hyah!
Frank! Frankie?
You there, Frank?
I'm sorry. He's... out.
Whoo-hoo!
Uhh!
This is very discouraging.
There is no excuse!
They're just kids.
Kids!
I want them found now,
or I'll tear out your liver!
I... I understand.
All right, move out!
Move out!
Please let me catch them.
Pretty please, let me catch them.
Ok, little guy.
You're comin' with... uhh!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Colt, come on.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Eh! Hyah!
Ow! Ooh!

He's friends with that Snyder guy.
Grandpa, please, it's just us.
Don't do it!
Grandpa, no!
Uhh!
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Boys!
Grandpa! Grandpa!
4 strands of rope never broken.
Boys, get off the ship.
But, grandpa, we can help you.
Go!
Get 'em.
Hyah!
Ha ha!
Come on.
We should run.
We should hide.
We should kick their butts!
Look out!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Ah... hyah!
Come on, boy. Round 2.

Hey, you're pretty good.
Hyah!
Oh!
Not!
Whoo-hoo! Oh, yeah.
All right!
You all right, man?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Let's get outta here.
We need a plan.
Yeah. We need a plan.
I've got a plan.
Let's rock this chump!
Come on, my little pets.
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Arrr... errah!
Ah!
Arrr...
Rocky, Colt, remember the practice dummy!
Light up the eyes, boys.
Light up the eyes!
Let's light this dude up!
Hyah!
Yeah!
Hyah! Arrrr!
Hyah!

Whoh... ah...
Yeah.
Hyah! Aah!
Yah! Yah! Yah!
Hello, boys!
Hello, grandpa.
Attention!
Very nice, old man.
You've taught the young ones well.
Yes. They have learned well.
What do you say? Teach my men?
No!
Shame.
Then I'm gonna have to kill you.
Let my family go.
No.
Then we fight...
You and me alone.
No one else.
And if I lose...
Then you die.
And if I win?
Well, golly.
I'm a sport.
If you win, the kids can go free.
Is that understood?
Yes, sir!
Am I nice guy or what?
You're a geek.
Shh!
May I speak to my family before I fight?
Certainly.
Come here, boys.
Now, listen, boys.
Stay back. Don't try to help me.
But, grandpa!
What?
But, grandpa, but what if you lose?
Remember lesson number one:
Never fight unless you're sure you can win.
Here. Take these for luck.
All right.
4 strands of rope.
Uhh!
Come on, grandpa! Get him!
Get him, gramps!
Unh! Uhh! Uhh!
Hyuh!
Look out!
Hyuh! Ohh!
Yah!
Get him, grandpa!
Grandpa, be careful!
Grr...
Rrr!
Aah!
That was a pepper bomb!
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Ohh!
Man.
Uhh!
Leave him alone!
Stop it!
No!
Stop!
Hyah!
Grandpa!
Uhh!
Say good-bye to your grandpa, boys!
Huh?!
So much for never fighting battles
you can't win!
Ha! Haa!
Uhh!
Yes!
Yeah, grandpa, get him!
Yes!
Grr...
Rrr...
Grandpa!
Ohh! Not so hard.
I'm an old man.
No!
Ooh!
I never lose!
Grr...
Never!
All right, freeze!
This is the FBI!
The ship is surrounded!
Nobody move!
Drop your guns! It's over!
Put the guns down!
Now slowly put your
hands on your heads
and lay down.
Hi, dad!
I wanna make a phone call.
Lend me 20 cents?
Listen, uh... I think I need a doctor.
Mori...
Mori, I...
I just want to say thank you.
Ohh!
Just a little bow will do, ok?
I told you you'd make
a great ninja warrior.
Thanks, mom.
Ok, guys, let's go.
Thanks for rescuing us, dad.
Hey, hey, come on. You guys are
the real heroes here, not me.
Does that mean that it'd still
be ok if we saw grandpa?
You got it, Colt.
And the same goes for Rocky and...
Tum Tum.
Tum Tum! Ha!
Yeah, the same goes for
Rocky and Tum Tum as well.
Let's go, Sam. We got evidence to collect.
I think you better do
it by yourself, Jerry.
By myself?
Yeah, I got whole family of heroes
I need to take out for pizza.
Yahoo! Yahoo!
Come on, grandpa!
I hate pizza.
Come on, man. Let me ride your bike.
No.
You rode it halfway home already.
Just let me borrow it for a minute.
I don't care. You lost yours.
I did not lose it.
It got stolen.
Well...
Uh, shh! Tum Tum, look at that.
Hi.
Hi.
Uh, can I walk you home?
If you weren't such a show-off,
we wouldn't be walking.
Rocky!
Ha! Ha!
Nice bikes.
Think it's time we taught
you jerks a lesson.
Uhh!
Look, we don't want to fight you.
Why don't you just stand
aside and give us our bikes
so nobody gets hurt?
Rocky...
Look, I'm gonna ask you again...
To let us go.
No.
Emily?
Show off.
Uhh! Uhh!
Nice bikes!
Thanks.
