(woman) I want you to talk about women.
Mr Crown?
I'm sorry.
Women.
You've yet to talk about women.
Oh, I enjoy women.
- Enjoyment isn't intimacy.
- Intimacy isn't necessarily enjoyment.
How would you know?
Has it occurred to you
that you have a problem with trust?
I trust myself implicitly.
Yes, but... can other people trust you?
You mean society at large?
I mean women, Mr Crown.
Yes, a woman could trust me.
Could?
Under what extraordinary circumstances
would you allow that to happen?
A woman could trust me...
..as long as her interests
didn't run too contrary to my own.
And society, at large?
If its interests were to run
counter to your own?
Jimmy, I think I'll walk for a while.
I'll meet you at the office.
- And your briefcase?
- I'll carry it.
(screeching brakes)
Jesus Christ!
(driver) Look at this jerk.
Morning, Mr Crown.
Bobby.
Back for your haystacks?
Don't ever let it go on tour, Bobby.
Oh, I'll lay down the law.
(chuckles) You're an odd duck.
Everyone else goes right for the Monet.
Well,...
..it's very nice.
Nice? Do you know what it's worth?
I just like my haystacks, Bobby.
Yo, you better move it.
Come on, buddy, go! Move it!
Jesus Christ.
Straight on.
Something's screwed up.
My list says some kind of a sarcophagus.
What do you want me to do? It's a horse.
You want me to take it back and dump it?
Nah, just unload the damn thing.
Boy, it's going to be hot today.
- Good morning, Mr Crown.
- Morning, Sam.
- You can't let him...
- (Crown clears throat)
- You own the building or something?
- Excuse us, sir.
- What the hell's going on?
- He does own it.
(lift bell)
- Good morning, Mr Crown.
- Morning. Good morning, one and all.
- Good morning, Mr Crown.
- John, welcome back.
Good morning, Mr Crown.
Good morning.
Give me good numbers, Jimmy.
Morning, Daria.
Good morning.
You forgot your briefcase, right?
I must have left it here last night.
We have a disparity here.
Yeah, I saw that.
Well, we can't leave it here.
Let's find out what the problem is.
That... is not...
..a sarcophagus.
It's Friday.
What did he mean by that?
Come Monday, there'll be hell to pay.
Deuce!
(laughter)
I never thought I'd see that.
Thomas Crown forced to sell something!
So, what do you think, Crown?
Any regrets about how you played this?
Regret...
- ..is usually a waste of time.
- (laughter)
As is gloating.
What will you say to your board when
they learn you paid me $30 million...
..more than others were offering?
Morning, gentlemen.
(sawing)
(cracking)
All right. English only from now on.
Except for Janni.
Janni doesn't speak English.
(sarcastic laughter)
Gentlemen, upon closer inspection,...
..your proposal is not
as generous as it seemed.
There's no mention
of executive compensation...
We understand your objection
to the merger.
It's not a merger!
I'm afraid your stockholders
have spoken.
- We anticipated your reluctance.
- We won't be a Crown subsidiary!
Our attorneys are prepared to go
head-to-head with you at the SEC.
I thought that kid would bust a gut
when you brought up the SEC!
How's it go? "Sad to see
another tired man lay down..."
"Sad to see another tired man
lay down his hand...
..and quit the holy game of poker."
He's right, you know.
Third-generation company.
You'd think they'd have shown more grit.
McCormick wants to know
our bid on the BPT deal.
Speak to Scully.
Miso soup, Daria.
Go! Go! Go!
This painting is considered to be
the first lmpressionist work in history.
It started that movement and influenced...
..dozens of major artists
who went on to found the first school,...
..or style, of the 20th century.
(sighs)
Okay, try this.
It's worth a hundred million bucks.
(all) Oh!
The government guy we paid off
on that deal is back.
No, this is the second time they lied.
Screw 'em.
- Turkey.
- Mr Schmidt called.
(Daria) The Douglaston conference call
is in ten minutes.
This painting's by another famous artist.
His name is Renoir.
Young lady,...
..do not touch.
(whispers) I'll let you go this time.
On your way.
(click)
(repeated clicking)
Aargh!
(beeping)
Hey!
Aargh!
Jimmy, go check the compressor room.
There's something wonky with the AC.
Can't we just pass it on to engineering?
- The book says we check it first.
- All right.
It would be
one of the hottest days of the year!
Can you believe it's nearly October?
(lift bell)
(lift bell)
- Why don't you bring the kids?
- You know how she is.
She'd run to court,
saying I was endangering them.
(lift bell)
- You're not kidding, are you?
- You wouldn't believe the shit she pulls.
The whole air-conditioning plant's
crapped out.
Why didn't they call maintenance?
Hmph!
- See you in the morning, Daria.
- Found your briefcase, I see.
Evidently.
- Good night, sir.
- Night.
Hey, they want to talk to you upstairs.
Me? Or the regular proctor?
Because McKinley'll be back in a second.
I think you should talk to them.
Call them if you like.
Administration, hello.
Yes, this is Jeff, in wing eight.
I was told you wanted to speak to me?
Okay, I'll be right up.
I'll, er, just go up.
Sorry, this exhibit is closing.
Please leave.
The exhibit is closed.
Please use the nearest exit.
The exhibit is closed.
We are closed for the evening.
We're closing. Please exit to the rear.
Thank you. This way.
Good night. Thank you very much.
This exhibit is closed.
What have we got here?
Hmm. It's only quarter to five.
We are closed.
For cleaning.
Hey, Bobby... I've been evicted.
- What?
- The lmpressionist Gallery.
Closed for cleaning.
- Cleaning?
- Yeah.
They're doing it right now.
Ed,...
- ..lend me a hand here for a minute?
- Certainly.
Excuse me!
What are you doing?
Yes.
What?
Upstairs sent us down...
..to clear this exhibit.
They have some VIPs coming through.
I didn't hear about it.
I oversee this section.
Call upstairs if you like.
No, you're right.
They've been having people
down here all week.
(shouting)
Stop him!
- (shouting)
- Look out, Mr Crown.
One at a time.
Keep moving. Move in a calm manner,
please. No need to panic. Thank you.
Hold it right there!
(helicopter)
Freeze!
Get your hands up!
(sirens)
(whistles)
68th and Lexington.
- Good evening, sir.
- Hey, Paul.
You want to put this in the study?
- I set out a bottle of wine.
- Thank you.
Ha! I may have won a cruise.
Oh, yes.
Mikey!
- Hi. Find the chopper?
- Abandoned in Queens.
- We know where it was stolen?
- Probably some pad in the Hamptons.
Mr Lenox!
Mr Lenox is the Director of the Museum.
Detective Michael McCann.
I'm sorry to be here, sir.
Who are the actors?
Four. Foreign. Probably Eastern
European. No print records.
Illegals. Check with lnterpol.
The Russian government might help.
In the works. Point of entry
was a statue delivered this morning.
Brought in with their own security.
Next you'll say it was a horse.
- A Trojan horse?
- Bingo.
- Someone has a sense of humour.
- We've three digits of the truck plate.
- This place been hit before?
- They just lost their cherry.
Mr Lenox, was it just the one painting?
But such an important one.
A seminal work. A historical watershed.
It's truly irreplaceable.
Great neighbourhood.
Some broads here are wearing my salary!
So the skylight was rigged to blow?
Yeah, and there were cargo nets
spread out, ready to use.
They wore rappelling harnesses
under their clothes.
Okay. Right.
Right, let's just track
this thing through. So,...
..they kill the air, make the place
uncomfortable, drive out the tourists.
They lower these gates
so nobody can get in.
They lower the paintings
into the cargo nets, pull the paintings,...
..ditch the frames, and figure
they'll fly out of here like Peter Pan.
But somebody makes them early.
Chopper takes off.
Some make it, some don't.
Basically, amateur night. Right?
What's that?
It was wedged under the gate.
And?
Not exactly Samsonite.
Titanium. The engineer said...
..it'd have to absorb 1 5 to 20 tons
to stop this gate.
(footsteps)
(woman) Seems there may be
a couple of holes in your theory.
They shut off the air to drive out the
tourists, then escort them out anyway?
Then they close the gates
to keep everybody out...
..but block one of them open while
they prepare to load, conservatively,...
..1 ,000 pounds of paintings and 800
pounds of men that we know about,...
..in a, um...
What was the chopper model?
- Sikorsky S-76.
- Right.
In a chopper
with a 600-pound useful load.
You, er,... figure you'll wrap this
by morning, Lieutenant?
It's Detective.
And I'm a little fuzzy about who you are.
- Sorry. Catherine Banning.
- Of?
Zurich Underwriters requested...
Actually they...
You're insurance.
The Swiss rather wouldn't
write a $100 million cheque.
- So I'm stuck with you on my back.
- Ohh...
Come on, Lieutenant. Who knows,...
- ..you might enjoy it.
- (chuckles)
Oh.
Whoa!
1 ,000 bucks says you can't do that again.
- Tony, put another ball there.
- Tommy,...
..it was a figure of speech.
Let's make it interesting.
Ten to one?
Fine. I'll take your money.
- Let's go again. Still ten to one.
- Tommy,...
..that's $100,000
on a goddamn golf swing.
It's a beautiful Saturday morning, John.
What the hell else have we got to do?
All right. She does live in Europe,
but she's from the Midwest.
- Born Catherine Olds.
- Who's Banning?
An Englishman she married
for six months.
- So she's not law enforcement.
- Worse. Bail bonds and bounties.
- Tough people.
- Yeah.
Her father is an Ohio hard case named
Clarence Milton Olds, called Bumper Olds.
Story goes he kept a chain
on his bumper.
A guy ran on him once, he brought him
back on the end of the chain.
- You don't want to cross him, huh?
- (door)
Good morning. How are you?
I said er,... how are you?
Jet-lagged. Thank you.
We thought we'd start with the, um...
security tapes. What is that?
You don't wanna know.
These are yesterday's tapes
from the lmpressionist Wing.
(Catherine) Why are they different
from the corridor cameras?
We're upgrading to thermal imagery.
So far, it's just the high value areas.
- It senses body heat.
- Got it. So that's the Monet that morning.
- Right.
- Okay, skip forward to the robbery.
- Time of the robbery.
- Whoa. Zip.
Was the camera working,
or did they cut the feed?
Oh!
(chuckles) No.
That's why they cut the air.
That could be. These things need
a ten degree difference.
If the ambient temperature
gets within ten degrees of the bodies,...
..the camera can't tell
between people and walls.
How hot did it get?
Check the other cameras.
So, why can you see
people in this room?
The ambient in that wing
only went up to the mid-80s.
Okay, wait a minute.
You're telling me
that for some reason...
..the area around that particular painting
went above 90?
(McCann) What?
I don't know. Something.
(McCann) What, are we...
channelling now?
How long have you been doing this?
A while.
Where? ln Europe?
And other places.
You're a real self-promoter.
Give me a for instance.
- How many legs?
- What?
The bench.
Two.
- You still have that tape up?
- Yeah.
Great. Back it up
to the morning part of the tape.
Stop.
Hello!
Jesus.
(McCann) So, they bring this in
earlier in the day. What's in it?
I mean, it could be a heater.
What?
In the briefcase, on a timer.
Bring the temperature up...
..ten more degrees.
- Do you ever eat?
- Hmm?
Lunch, for instance?
Do you like pizza?
I know a great place we could stop.
I'm on London time.
And pizza's not your thing. Okay.
What's the matter, Lieutenant?
Did she leave you for a stockbroker? Hm?
It's Detective. First Grade.
And uh,...
..he was a urologist.
Can I drop you someplace?
At your hotel?
One, I keep an apartment here.
And two, I'm going to your office.
She keeps an apartment.
I keep goldfish.
Hey! Hello there.
How are you doing?
Detective.
Look, they don't seem to be Russian.
Davros thinks maybe Romanian.
- The witness is here.
- Right.
- Come on in!
- Hm-mm.
- Number four.
- (McCann) You're sure?
I'm sure.
Okay.
- Do you mind indicating that here?
- Certainly.
- Just check it off.
- Sure.
Could you sign down here, please?
They will finish the paperwork.
Appreciate it, Mr Crown.
(Crown) Thank you.
- I'm gonna beat up the Romanians.
- Okay.
Thank you, thank you.
Wait a minute!
Gotta get some coffee.
- That's all.
- Would you be willing to testify?
- Sure, absolutely.
- Mr Crown, I have to tell you,...
..people like this might have friends.
You realise they might
try to make it ugly for a witness?
I understand, gentlemen, and, er,
I guess I'll take my chances.
(Paretti) We'll nail them.
(Crown) I can't imagine somebody
thinking they'd get away with this.
(Polish)
They say anything yet?
Not in English. We're still trying
to find somebody to translate.
Let me try.
Do not tell me you speak Romanian.
(Catherine) God, who would
ever bother with Romanian?
Give me the quiet one.
Okay.
Vous aimez les États-Unis?
Sehen Sie gern Gangsterfilme?
Mit Edward G Robinson.
Seine Familie stammt aus Rumänien.
Ich will einen Rechtsanwalt.
Aber Sie sind doch
kein Staatsbürger. Hmm?
Da gibt es keinen Prozeß.
Sie werden ganz einfach deportiert.
Rumänier ohne Ausweise
machen uns nervös.
Nervös.
Die könnten...
..(whispers) Securitate sein.
Deine Regierung nimmt Geheimpolizei.
(grunts)
Was die... mit dir...
..machen. Hmm?
They do speak English.
It was a pre-packaged robbery.
He picked them up in Little Odessa.
They were given timetables...
Okay, who's "he"?
You don't think they know, do you?
They were intermediaries,
never saw or heard him.
One-time hires. That's why they failed.
What makes you think they failed?
Maybe it was a successful robbery.
Maybe they were set up.
- Why?
- Diversion!
Make a lot of noise over there,...
..so over here you take $100 million
off the wall and waltz out the door.
- Oh, that's good.
- Doesn't matter.
As soon as he tries to sell it,
we nail him.
Oh!
He's not going to sell.
- He's not?
- Mm-mm.
This is an elegant crime done by
an elegant person. It's not about money.
Okay, so who's going to risk prison
to steal a Monet...
..just to not sell it?
A Monet-lover.
Uh, whose desk is that?
- Um...
- Could I use it?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Let's dig up every major auction
in the last five years...
..and see who's been bidding on Monets.
See anyone we know?
Him? A big day for this guy
is taking off his tie. He's a finance geek.
Is he?
- How's that?
- Yeah!
(laughter)
Go, go!
Whoo-hoo!
Ease up!
Whoa!
No, wait!
Come on, get it up! Yes, let's go!
Yeah! Whoa!
I saw him wreck a $100,000 boat
because he liked the splash.
Do you have any idea
what kind of flesh-eating lawyers...
- ..this guy will have? Hmm?
- Hm-mm.
Plus political connections.
(giggles)
Mr Thomas Crown has very generously
loaned us a Pissarro,...
- (applause)
- ..until our own Monet is restored to us.
Not to mention apprehending
one of the suspects. Come on!
I'm afraid Jim embellishes horrendously.
I just did what he does at fund-raisers.
I waved my arms in the air and...
- ..shrieked for help.
- (laughter)
Hello, Gloria. Lovely to see you.
- (woman) I knew him, you know.
- Did you, madame?
His son, that is.
Lucien Pissarro, in the '30s in Paris.
It's very impressive.
It seemed the right size for the space.
Or maybe you were bored with it.
Do we know each other?
Not yet. I'm Catherine Banning.
Thomas Crown.
Vodka rocks, twist and um,...
..Scotch, neat.
How did you know that?
- I've been reading about you.
- Oh! Where?
In a file.
- Who do you work for?
- I'm in the art world.
- Dealer?
- Hm-mm.
Gallery owner?
No, it's closer to insurance.
I'm covered.
Not for this.
The painting?
The Monet?
You don't think
they'd simply cut a cheque...
..for $100 million, do you?
So, you...?
Get them things.
When there's this much money involved,
it usually means I get them...
- ..someone's head.
- Whose head are you after?
Yours. Good evening, Mr Crown.
Are you trying to, er... (chuckles)
Are you trying to imply that I had
something to do with that painting?
Trying?
Thank you.
No, I wouldn't call it an attempt.
What's your take for this?
Five per cent of the value recovered.
- A bounty hunter.
- If you like.
- Always get your man?
- Hm-mm.
Think you'll get me?
Oh, I hope so.
- Can I drop you somewhere?
- I have a car here, thanks.
Ah! Then, er, tomorrow?
- (engine starts)
- Us, dinner?
You're on.
Make it early.
We have a stop to make first.
- What's happened?
- Happened?
When I talk, while you're tuning out what
I say, the corners of your mouth go up.
You're enjoying something.
It's not me. What is it?
- An entertainment.
- Very little entertains you,...
..so I can easily guess.
A worthy adversary?
Hmm?
Did someone swindle you?
(chuckles)
You waltz in there
without even a heads up,...
..without one word to me
or anyone else in the department.
I, er, had a little chat with him, yes.
A little chat?
You told him he was a suspect.
I cut through the crap, okay?
How long was it gonna take you, Mike?
Weeks of wiretaps,...
..if you could get them.
Guys tailing him to the bathroom.
I found out in ten minutes.
He did it.
The smug son of a bitch did it.
- You compromised the investigation.
- I jump-started it.
Oh, really? What do you have
to show for it, besides a date?
He likes the high wire.
I'm going to play with him for a while.
I could ask the question
who's playing whom.
You saying I shouldn't go?
Don't piss on the department,
Catherine, okay? We're on this.
How do you do? This is a warrant.
We're here to conduct a legal search
on these premises. I'd let us.
Jack, give me two men up here
and two more men in this room. Move.
John, take the back room.
(policeman) You want help in here?
- Mr Crown.
- Thank you.
Er, excuse me?
Why are you in my house?
I'm sure it's a mystery to you.
Your lawyer can explain.
Wallace?
This gentleman happens
to be my attorney.
Oh, keep your knickers on.
I'll get into his house.
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.
- How are you?
- Popular.
Mikey, you won't believe this.
Know where's he taking her?
To the museum.
He's taking her to the fucking museum?
It's kind of sweet, you know?
For a first date.
Hey, I didn't know your portrait was here.
The faceless businessman in a bowler
hat. Everything but the briefcase.
Did you sit long for the artist?
- Actually, er, I do own a copy of that.
- (laughs)
Oh, of course you do.
And where might you be taking me?
Come, come, come.
Good evening, sir.
The museum is closing in 1 5 minutes.
Thank you.
- Oh, your loaner.
- Uh-huh. The least I could do.
Hm. (sniffs)
Oh, I see they have the air back on.
I shouldn't have checked my coat.
- Oh, thank you.
- Hm-mm.
You know,
if I had my pick in this room,...
..I wouldn't have taken the Monet.
- No?
- No.
What would you take?
- For my personal choice?
- Hmm.
Um...
That one.
- You?
- Hmm.
You'd like to have that?
Why?
Would you get it for me?
Anything's obtainable.
(chuckles) Okay, I'll bite.
What would you do to get it?
I'd buy a print.
They're going into Cipriani.
I thought they were going to Le Cirque.
I'm watching them walk into Cipriani.
And with no reservation.
Scotch neat for me and I guess
the lady would like a, um...
What?
That the lady actually likes champagne.
- We have Krug Grand Cuvèe 1981 .
- Sounds great, thank you.
- Wonderful. On the way.
- You've been busy.
I'm sure your files are thicker than mine.
Well, the thing that impressed me most...
..was getting from Glasgow to Oxford
on a boxing scholarship.
Not bad for a wee lad from Glasgee.
It was easy. Rich kids cannae box.
(Catherine chuckles)
The hard part was learning to talk.
But you now...
- The matador?
- Hmm.
The ltalian industrialist.
The Ambassador's son?
- He was cute.
- He was 17!
Yes, he was.
You must admit, that's a fair litany
for a girl from Lima, Ohio.
But what I didn't get...
I mean, it's obvious you like men...
..but you never keep any of them
around very long either.
Oh, well... men make...
women messy.
Thank you.
Here's to the fear of being trapped.
- Here's the fish for the lady.
- Thank you.
The lamb chops for the gentleman.
We'd like to pre-order soufflés.
And a bottle of burgundy
to those two gentlemen.
- Of course, sir.
- Thank you.
At least they look uptown. The ones
yesterday looked like flashers.
- Well, we do our best.
- I'm under glass.
Soon you'll know everything about me.
There are things we don't know.
Like what?
Like why.
Were you bored?
Acquisitions and mergers
looking a little stodgy?
Is it more fun getting it than keeping it?
- Is this the fun for you?
- How do you mean?
It's not about the money.
You like the chase.
Not many women get to chase.
It's like poker.
We don't let you in the game.
Right. My brothers said
I didn't have the mind for it.
- And now they're plumbers.
- Oh! But you knew that.
- Can I ply you with anything else?
- Nothing.
- Cheese? Would you like a...
- Would you like a deal?
Make it easy on yourself.
We'll just get more warrants, searches.
Mess up your carpeting.
May l...
May I ask you a very personal question?
Why not?
Would you like another hit of espresso?
- Would you like...
- Another hit of espresso?
Hmm.
- That's the very personal question?
- As good as it gets.
Oh! Excuse me.
May I ask you a very personal question?
- Oh, sure! By all means.
- Do you really think...
..I'm going to sleep
with a man I'm investigating? Hmm?
- Is that the question?
- That's it.
Why should I answer that when you didn't
seriously commit to my espresso?
All right. I'll seriously commit
to your espresso.
I'd let you in...
But the world is watching.
Yes, they are.
And besides,...
..you have no furniture.
Oh, that's good. That's very good.
Good night.
Good night.
Alone?
Ready?
Okay.
Ground.
Okay.
Ten.
Eleven.
Twelve.
Thirteen.
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
- Nineteen.
- (beeps)
Got it.
- Good.
- You're slipping, Larry.
Give me a break.
The guy's got a ten-digit PIN.
- Check the basement first.
- You got it.
Excuse me!
- Is that it?
- We got it.
She got it!
(applause)
- Is the expert here?
- Ready and waiting.
- Let's see what you got.
- Okay.
This is George French, head of forensics.
- Hi, George.
- Hi.
This is Dr Cornelius of Manhattanville.
Come in, Doc.
Catherine Banning.
- How do you do?
- Hello! Well, go to work, Doctor.
Don't glare at me, Michael.
So, are the laws of the United States
completely unknown to you?
- Or is it cos you've lived in Morocco...
- Monaco.
I don't care.
It's illegal entry, theft, trespassing.
- I'm not a cop.
- Exactly. Cops know this won't hold up.
- Don't you want him to go up for...
- My job is the painting.
(Cornelius) You've got a ghost here.
What?
Another painting underneath.
Monet reused his canvases.
Monet's unknown masterpiece,...
.."Dogs at Cards".
Where is that sack of shit?
Where is he right now?
(band plays "Windmills Of Your Mind")
Excuse me?
I'm cutting in.
Hmm. It's all right, Anna.
I'll see you later.
It's a black and white ball.
Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't invited anyway.
- You left yourself wide open.
- You're all flushed.
How many people can forge a Monet?
Five? Maybe six?
I'm sure I can't be arrested for a joke.
- This was a little too good.
- You're just inches away.
I am. You think
I'll just peck up crumbs you lay out?
I can smell blood on my own.
(laughs)
You smug son of a...
(band plays a mambo)
Yeeah!
Do you wanna dance...
..or do you wanna dance?
(laughter)
No!
Get away! Get away!
Oh! You are...
the most remarkable woman.
You don't think we're finished,
do you?
(laughs)
(shrieks)
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Morning, Paul.
- Can I get you anything else?
- Not a thing.
- Hmm, thank you, Paul.
- Thank you, Paul.
I suppose you didn't just run out for that.
No.
No.
Damn. I hate being a foregone conclusion.
You live very well.
Thank you.
It'd be a shame to lose it all.
That depends...
..on a very large presumption.
Yes, it does.
I won't back off, you know.
Not even for a minute.
I would be hugely disappointed if you did.
(Crown) How do porcupines mate?
Old joke. Very carefully.
Carefully. Or... unsuccessfully.
Don't see many porcupines.
Creatures with highly evolved
defence systems.
Like porcupines?
Like 42-year-old, successful...
..self-involved loners.
If you've found a female mirror image...
..and think you'll form
a rewarding relationship...
Think again?
Good morning.
Nice dress.
Looks like it was a great party.
- (Catherine) Hm-mm.
- (Paretti laughs)
You gonna be a cliché?
Did you even think twice?
- No.
- You knew what you were doing?
My job. He likes me. He'll keep liking me.
Keep him right next to me.
And you don't care...
..what that makes you.
- I know what I'm doing.
- Do you really?
This is just about money, Mike.
Oh, oh, oh, he's got a problem.
I could get used to this.
- Just hold on now.
- Hold on why?
(screams)
- Take the stick.
- Oh, I'm not...
- Take it.
- I'm not taking...
- Put your hands on it.
- Oh, no!
That's it. That's good.
- That's good.
- Oh, my God!
Head for that hill over there. Don't lose it.
There you go.
This is ridge-running. We're doing it.
- Oh, this is great.
- I'm in your hands.
- Just feel that. You feel it? Hmm?
- I do.
- Oh!
- Left. To the left.
We'll pick up a thermal
coming over the hill.
- Oh!
- Just like a hawk.
(cows moo)
Cows.
Oh, that's okay. We're only about
four states from your car.
That island...
..isn't Manhattan.
- It's not?
- No.
I have appointments.
Wanna keep them?
Door's welded. Throw your leg over.
Throw my leg over.
(Catherine) This must go over.
(Crown) With whom?
Whomever you bring here.
I never bring anyone here.
Voilà.
I bet they're all my size.
Could be. Might be off a little
here and there, but I think they'll make do.
I'll go make dinner.
Ah! Come on!
- You want some wine?
- Yes!
Whoo, it's beautiful!
Want to see it?
No.
- You sure?
- I'm sure.
Like a splash?
Come here.
Wanna see it?
No.
You sure?
You think I believe you'd leave
your hard-stolen painting...
..lying around a Caribbean hut?
What if I did?
And that you'd tell me?
Well, what if I trust you?
You know you can't.
You don't believe you could trust me?
You know how likely I think that is?
Excuse me.
Should I open another bottle?
Hmm. Yes.
- I think so.
- I think so.
'85 wasn't very good.
- No, it's not... No...
- Truce. A truce would be good.
(Catherine) That'd be great.
That'd be good.
What was it?
- A nice little Renoir.
- Oh.
Renoir.
A nice little copy?
We'll never know, will we?
- Okay, I give up!
- Easy, easy. (chuckles)
- I'll get that bottle.
- Oh, yeah, that would be good.
Oh, you're not boring, I'll give you that.
(distant voices)
(indistinct French)
- You complimented me.
- How?
- They were bankers.
- Who?
(chuckles) Who? The suits.
You're transferring assets.
Getting ready to run.
And suppose I did run?
Then what would you have?
Not the painting,
not the $5 million fee, not me.
Yes?
Suppose I gave you ten?
To fail?
How would I hide it?
I'd teach you.
You really think there's
happy ever after for people like us?
So just how big of a thief are you?
Well, if you count Wall Street,...
..pretty big.
If you mean art,...
..I'm just an amateur.
Beginner's luck, huh?
Gentleman jockey wins the Derby.
Something like that.
You got your hand caught
in the cookie jar now.
How are you gonna get out of it?
(Crown sighs) It's just a game, love.
(whispers) Just a game.
- Nice tan.
- Thanks.
I went to the beach for a couple of days.
On the job?
That's right.
And did you pick anything... up?
Well, he's got an ornament...
..worn by Barbarossa
at his coronation in 1 1 52.
Really? Stolen?
No.
So that's it, after two days...
..and two nights?
That was it.
Would you like to know where he was
the night before you left?
Or after he left you last night?
Not really.
Okay. Suit yourself.
Michael.
(whispers) Oh,...
..she's, er...
..striking.
He seems to think so.
Three dates in six days.
Well,...
..where does he find the time?
You okay?
Yeah.
You know, I was okay once.
My girlfriend, er, got drunk.
Stayed out all night,
came back in the morning... married.
Yeah.
I told people I didn't care... and then l...
..fucked five women in three days,
flipped my car on an on-ramp,...
..beat a suspect unconscious,
got suspended.
But um... I was okay.
Is there a point to this story?
But he was with him.
What's this?
Photos of the Monet's borders.
The borders?
Insurers remove a painting from the frame
to photograph its borders.
Borders are never seen in galleries
or auctions, so if a picture's stolen and...
..someone makes a forgery,
the borders won't match.
And if they do happen to match?
Then the forger
was in the presence of the original.
- So, if Crown's prank Monet is too good...
- Then we find the forger...
..and nail the bastard.
- How long have you had these?
- Five days.
And you didn't open them?
Yeah, well, they're open now.
- It's beautiful.
- You're not going to say...
.."I couldn't possibly"?
No.
I, er...
..I wouldn't say anything that boring.
She's an old friend,...
..but it'll be like
having dinner in a morgue.
But you know, it occurred to me, I might
be able to bear it if you came with me.
Tomorrow? That's so soon.
I sense hesitation.
No...
No.
- Do you find my company monotonous?
- (laughs) No.
Cos I'd hate to think you could.
What, be bored by you?
Require a little variety?
You're referring to Anna.
They photographed me with Anna.
- You know, that's your prerogative.
- I thought they were.
I let it happen.
- Want to know why?
- No.
- I'll tell you.
- Don't.
- I want to tell you.
- I don't want to know.
Jimmy, I'd like to get out.
- Keep driving.
- Stop!
- I don't want to know why!
- Let me tell you!
- No!
- Ah, shit.
- Now ask me why!
- I don't want to know!
- You're upset about it!
- Yeah, cos you wanted me to be upset!
- I needed you to be upset!
- Ho-ho, he's sadistic! Who knew?
- Did it occur to you I needed to know?
- Know what?!
Know whether all it was to you...
..was the painting?
How else could I know?
What about you?
I can leave here tomorrow.
So can you.
- We'd be fugitives.
- Fugitives with means.
All the difference in the world.
(whispers) I don't know.
I don't know.
Oh dear. Peter Pan decides to grow up,
and finds there's no place to land.
The only sad part is...
..if she's anything like you...
..she won't know what she's lost
until it's gone.
Hey! Let's go.
Where?
The borders matched perfectly.
Then again, I'm sure you knew that,
didn't you?
Come on. Let's go meet some forgers.
I was never an lmpressionist.
Anyway, I pay taxes now.
Doing what?
Portraits.
Inserting the rich into old masterpieces.
- The wife's face on the Mona Lisa.
- Hmm.
From Brooklyn to Greenwich
in one generation.
You've gotta have the paintings to match.
So, who did it?
The German.
Heinrich...
(Catherine) Knutzhorn.
Art's a small world, Michael.
So, who do you think did this?
Frederick Golchan.
He said you did.
So you think if I want paint,
it just comes Fed Ex?
And the guards just think it's therapy,...
..while I madly copy a Monet
in my cell from the original?
What?
What?
Nothing.
What?!
I was just wondering
about what he wouldn't say.
Give.
There's nothing.
You know what?
Life is full of shitty conflicts, okay? Give.
I just wondered if there was
a connection between them, that's all.
Between Crown and that old man?
Yeah.
- You are spooky. You are really spooky.
- They owned a gallery together,...
..Crown and Knutzhorn. In Berlin, 1990.
Another one in Hamburg.
And one in Paris in '94.
You notice the one-man show
in Paris in '95?
The artist is Knutzhorn.
So?
So look at the first name.
Tyrol Knutzhorn.
Yeah, we spoke to a Heinrich.
You know what it was?
The way he smiled at the painting?
Pride.
Paternal pride.
I bet you it's his son.
Son of a great forger,
who paints as well as Dad.
Just hasn't been caught yet.
Well, I assume if you look,...
..you'll find Tyrol Knutzhorn
lives in New York.
You know what?
l... er, I owe you an apology.
I didn't think you had the chops
to see this through.
You don't know me.
Yeah, but I should have. Cos...
I bet you'd stand at the Pearly Gates...
..and kick St Peter in the teeth
before you'd let someone play you.
Harold, listen carefully
and please don't interrupt.
If I had to be gone, and I mean
seriously gone, in about eight hours,...
..how much could I take with me?
- Are you okay?
- Harold...
You'd take an enormous loss,
liquidating like this.
I understand, and that can't be helped.
What could I leave with?
Call me in an hour.
I'll have a number for you.
Okay.
Leaving us?
No, you're not that lucky.
I'm organising.
No Knutzhorn has been
to see the old man.
No?
There was a Knudsen, though,
three times last month.
Think that's a coincidence, or...?
Could be.
Yeah.
Probably is.
Hmm.
Look, here's an extra hundred.
- Just go, go!
- (hooting)
- Paul, is he here?
- He's in a meeting now.
- It's very important.
- If you wait in the living room, I'll get him.
Ma'am, wait.
(Crown) I know we have plug adapters,
I saw them.
I just can't find them. Would you go
downstairs, Anna, and ask Paul...
Well... we seem to have backtracked.
- No!
- No.
Take your hands off me!
Come on,
what do you have that's fresh?
Who's that girl and why is she here?
Anna works for me.
You never thought I was a fool before.
I owe her money
and I wanted to pay her before I go.
- Oh, really?
- Hm-mm.
And what is it she does for you?
I would be compromising her to say.
Oh, Tommy, you're going away together.
No, I'm going with you.
Of all the things in the world
to take with a leap of faith,...
- ..how can I possibly trust you?
- I'm not gonna ask that.
I'm going to trust you.
Isn't that what you wanted,...
..my trust?
Tomorrow afternoon...
..I'll put the Monet back.
Where? Hanging back
on the wall in the museum?
Yes.
You know, Tommy,
I'm all checkmated out.
If the painting's back, we're free.
We're only for each other.
Back on the wall, in the museum?
Yes, and you'll meet me...
..at four o'clock
at the Wall Street heliport,...
..and we'll leave together.
Or...
Or you can have them at the museum
waiting for me.
I'm trusting you.
I can't... do that!
Damn you, you son of a bitch! Get away!
Hey.
(sighs) Hi.
I need to talk to you.
- Paretti.
- Yeah.
You're in the lobby, right?
Yeah, Mikey, I'm here.
Me and about 30 other guys.
Let up on yourself.
You did the right thing.
Assuming the son of a bitch shows up.
(sirens)
Mark, stay with the car.
Get a uniformed man on the fire escape.
Got it.
Detective!
Shh...
Yeah.
Goddamn it.
Did she leave anything behind?
Stake out the whole place.
Maybe she'll come back. I don't know.
No, no, no.
Is Jack there? Put him on the phone.
Get Jack!
- What?
- The forger.
You didn't think we just dropped that,
did you? Jack ran it down.
It was a daughter.
She was under our noses the whole time.
Tyrol Anna Knudsen, Knutzhorn,...
..whatever.
Crown's known her since she was ten.
When her father went to jail, he became
her guardian. Put her through college.
Now she works for his company.
Jack, here's what I want you to do.
He's in.
Got him.
(McCann) I'll call you back.
That's him.
Overcoat and briefcase.
Yeah, Mikey. We got him.
Centre entrance. Grey overcoat.
Bring up the lobby on the big monitor.
(McCann) Move in quietly.
- We don't wanna make a scene.
- Tommy...
What the hell's he doing?
Almost like he wants
to make sure we see him.
Let's play ball.
There he goes. Bowler hat.
Move in and pick him up.
Go. Move it.
Quietly. Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Shit. He switched the painting.
Stay with the painting.
What? Look, I can't...
Shit! There's another one.
- There's guys with bowler hats...
- All over the goddamn place.
- Did you warn him?
- What? No.
- Did you warn him?
- No!
- Then he knew you'd betray him.
- They're going for the staircases.
Now we got four floors to keep track of.
Stay with him. He disappears,
it'll be ten years before he resurfaces.
- Is the lmpressionist Wing sealed off?
- Yes.
- No way to get in?
- The gates are down.
He can't return the painting to that room.
- They're everywhere.
- What's the deal?
# Oh Sinnerman,
where you gonna run to?
# Sinnerman, where you gonna run to?
# Where you gonna run to?
# All on that day
# Will I run to the rock?
# Please help me, and run to the rock
He's going the other way!
# Please help me, Lord, all on that day
# Put the rock right up
What? What? Look, I can't hear you.
# I ain't gonna help you that,
all on that day
# I said, rock
# What's the matter with you, rock?
# Don't you see I need you, rock?
# Lord, Lord, Lord, all on that day
# So I run to the river
# It was bleedin'
I run to the sea
This is ridiculous.
He's got us running around in circles.
Paretti's trying to reach you.
- I can't...
- You're fucked. I'm coming.
# It was boilin'
I run to the sea
# It was boilin'
all on that day
# So I run to the Lord
# Please help me, Lord
# Don't you see me praying?
What do we do?
- What do we do?
- Start arresting people. Come on.
Excuse me, sir. One moment.
Shit.
(alarm)
I knew it.
Excuse me.
(# "Sinnerman" continues)
Get the civilians outta here.
How do we get this gate open?
Kill the sprinklers
in the lmpressionist Wing now.
(coughs)
It's water paint.
It's been here the whole time. From what?
One, two days after the robbery?
Something's jammed in the track.
He returned the thing
almost as soon as he stole it.
Er, sir?
Oh, Lord.
Oh, dear, dear. This can't be.
This simply can't be.
- (Paretti) How the hell did he do that?
- (McCann grunts)
Where are you going?
Er, office.
Write up my report.
- The job's done, right?
- Yeah!
So, the other painting. Why do you think
he chose that particular one?
I have no idea.
But, um, it's not insured by my people,
so I'm out of it.
Obviously you'll still have to pursue it.
I don't really give a shit.
You don't care if you catch him?
Well, I'll do what they tell me to do.
- Did you ever care?
- Yeah!
He pissed me off.
But, look...
The week before I met you...
..I nailed two real estate agents and
a guy who was beating his kids to death.
So if some Houdini wants to...
..snatch a few swirls of paint
that are only important...
..to some very silly rich people,...
..I don't really give a damn.
You're a good man.
Okay. Get out of here. And tell him...
..I said hello.
I've no idea what you're talking about.
Go on.
And don't stiff us for your phone bills.
No.
Taxi!
(hooting)
You know, I'm just going to run. Thanks.
Excuse me.
Ma'am, you can't go out there!
Tommy!
You would be Catherine?
Yes.
He wanted you to have this.
Good day, ma'am.
Hi there.
How can I help you?
I have a reservation.
Okay. Miss Banning.
Will you be carrying any luggage today?
No.
(sighs)
Can you see that this...
..gets to this man at police headquarters?
This should take care of it.
It won't get there till morning.
That's fine.
Departures for international flights
are up the escalator to your left.
Ma'am?
Is everything all right?
Everything's fine.
(sobs)
(Scottish accent)
You don't need to cry there, lassie.
Did you set this up?
Did you set this up?
Did you?!
Miss, please,
the seat belt sign is still on...
(Catherine sighs)
I'll tell you what.
You pull a stunt like that again,...
(whispers) ..I'll break both your arms.
