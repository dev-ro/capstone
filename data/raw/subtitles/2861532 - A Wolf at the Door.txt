A WOLF AT THE DOOR
Hi, mrs. Arlete.
Hi, mom. Didn't you see her?
- What do you mean?
- Clarinha left with Sheila.
Who's Sheila?
You were sick,
your neighbor would come.
I'm not sick,
I didn't call you today.
I don't have a neighbor
named Sheila.
- What...?
- What's going on?
Where's the girl?
Why is mrs. Sylvia telling me
her daughter was kidnapped?
I don't know, sir. She
called me, told me she was sick.
- Who?
- Sylvia.
That's not
what she's telling me.
Well... Then someone called
pretending to be her.
- Who called?
- How would I know?
She knew my name, she knew...
I don't know...
So you just hand the kids
to anyone, is that it?
- She wasn't "anyone".
- Who, then?
- Sheila.
- Who's Sheila?
- Mrs. Sylvia's neighbor.
- She doesn't know any Sheila.
Well, maybe it was a different
name. I think it was Sheila.
I didn't write it down.
My memory's not good, maybe...
Teacher, please.
Was it or wasn't it Sheila?
I don't...
- You're confused, aren't you?
- I'm a bit...
Look at what's happening.
It's complicated, I'm not
gonna lie. But focus.
Who's the woman who picked
the girl instead of her mother?
So many mothers call...
They call all the time,
I can't really know
if the voice was really hers.
She said she was Sylvia.
Teacher, you must have
a way of checking
if what they say is true.
How do you give children
to strangers in a city like Rio?
She wasn't a stranger.
OK? She wasn't.
The girl ran to her arms,
kissed her, hugged her.
She was nice.
I don't just hand them out.
- How old is the girl?
- 6 years old.
Six... Who took her
to school today?
My husband,
Bernardo, the father.
Right... And what does he do?
He's a supervisor
in a bus company.
- And you?
- I'm unemployed.
When was the last time
you saw your daughter?
Today, at lunch hour,
before she went to school.
Do you suspect anyone who'd
pretend to be your neighbor?
No, no one... If I did,
I would've gone after her.
Anyone with looking for revenge
against you or your husband?
- No, no one. Mister...
- Any fights in your building?
Nothing of the kind.
It was a mistake, I'm sure.
They got the wrong girl.
Maybe they kidnapped
the wrong girl,
we've got no money,
nothing.
- Do you understand?
- I see. Just a moment.
Let's go back to the questions.
How long have you been married?
Why is that important now,
for Heaven's sake?
I'm trying to understand how
your relationship is.
- It's fine. It is.
- It really is?
- Do you think he has a lover?
- No...
- No? Are you sure?
- No...
I don't know.
- "No" or "I don't know"?
- I don't know, maybe.
- Sometimes he acts weird...
- I see. Do you suspect anyone?
No, I couldn't even say.
It's just a hunch.
And you?
Do you have or had a lover?
Enough.
- Is the commissioner here?
- Bernardo?
Just a moment.
Boss.
Bernardo, the girl's father.
Excuse me.
Honey...
Rosa Maria Correa, she's the one
who kidnapped my daughter.
I'm absolutely sure, chief.
She thinks it's a joke.
She's messing with me.
But it's a crime.
I need your help,
I don't know what to do.
OK, OK, we're working on it.
Who is that woman,
Rosa Maria Correa?
Rosa is a woman who'll be
at Oswaldo Cruz Station,
we arranged to meet there.
I'm absolutely sure
she did this to scare me.
It's all a joke. She'll
be there with my daughter.
- What time...?
- 7 PM.
- 7 PM at Oswaldo Cruz. Correct?
- Yes, sir.
And what is your relationship
with this woman, Rosa Maria?
Your lover?
For how long have you had
this extramarital relationship?
One year. I can't believe
she did this to me.
She's not coming, buddy.
If she's not,
I don't know what to do.
Do you know where she lives?
With her parents,
but I don't think she's there.
Any idea where
she might be now?
So we'll start by the house.
- Where is it?
- Marechal Lemes St.
Let's go.
- Yes?
- I'd like to talk, please.
- Yes?
- Rosa Maria Correa?
I'd like to talk to her.
Rosa. Rosa!
Rosa, my daughter,
they want to talk to you.
Rosa, come...
Did anything happen?
Ms. Rosa?
You're being accused
of kidnapping Clarinha.
Boss. Rosa.
- Your name?
- Rosa.
Full name, honey.
Rosa Maria Correa.
- Age?
- 25.
- Marital status?
- Single.
Profession?
I was a telemarketing
operator.
- "Was"?
- Yes, I left.
Put down "unemployed", Souza.
Let's go. Where's the girl?
What girl?
Clara, Bernardo
and Sylvia's daughter.
I don't know what
you're talking, sorry.
The girl who was kidnapped
today, we know you took her.
Me? No...
What is this?
Listen, Rosa...
We already know
of your affair with Bernardo,
kidnapping is a crime...
But if you help me
solve this quickly,
they may even
withdraw the complaint.
All they want is their daughter,
as pretty as when they left her.
I have nothing
to do with this.
OK...
Let me try again.
You do know Bernardo, right?
I know a Bernardo,
I don't know if it's the same.
Do you have
an affair with him?
I had.
So, you like
fucking married men?
No need to answer that.
Didn't you arrange
to meet him today
at Oswaldo Cruz station, 7 PM?
I did.
You were going to show up
with his daughter.
What daughter? I wasn't
taking any kids, come on!
OK. Just stay there.
Teacher, do you recognize
that woman as that Sheila...?
Guys, that's her!
It's you, huh?
OK, it was me.
- But I don't know where she is.
- Didn't I tell you?
OK, thank you, teacher.
You can go home and rest...
Maybe think of a new job,
not a very good daycare owner...
- I'll be at your disposal.
- Don't go far.
- Where is this child?
- I don't know.
Look, I told the truth.
I only did what I was told.
I delivered her
to another woman, that's all.
She asked me to. I did
nothing to the girl, I swear.
Another woman? Who?
Nice to meet you, I'm Beth.
- Rosa.
- I know your name's Rosa.
- What do you want with me?
- I want you to do something.
My man's cheating on me
with a slut. A married bitch.
Those two sons
of bitches meet
when her husband sneaks out
to meet a certain
somebody, right, Rosa?
Pretty flower...
I don't know about that...
I know you have an affair
with Bernardo, don't play dumb.
Do what you want,
I don't fucking care.
It's you ass, not mine.
It's your problem.
My problem's with Sylvia,
his wife. Your pal.
I don't know what Mario saw
in her, she screws him around,
treats him like a dog
and he keeps chasing her.
What do I care?
I'll scare that bitch,
and you'll help me.
- Me?
- Yeah.
It'll be a scare
for your lover boy, too.
You know the girl, right?
Their child?
So...
I'll call the school,
say that I'm Sylvia,
that I'm sick, I don't know...
That my neighbor, you, Sheila,
is picking the girl up
before class ends.
You get that girl and bring her
to me, do you hear?
Don't make that asshole face,
I won't harm the girl.
It's just a scare.
Just a 24-hour disappearance.
So that mom freaks out.
I'll return her later,
with a note telling that bitch
not to mess
with other women's men.
Do that alone...
Sure, I'll just go looking
like this to pick the girl up.
Stop the clown act.
The girl never saw me.
You go.
She's tired of seeing you.
You and her daddy.
Right, ms. Rosa?
- I'm not doing it.
- I'm not fooling around, girl!
Lower your voice
when you talk to me.
If you don't go I'll tell Sylvia
what you do with Bernardo.
You'll lose him then.
I know you don't want that.
You're a skank
just like her...
Stop messing around.
Drink that shit, I paid for it.
And where did that Beth
go with the girl?
How would I know?
I don't know,
I just delivered the girl.
She said it was
only a scare, I don't know.
She told me
she lives near my house.
Tito, go to this bar
she's talking about,
see if anyone
knows this Beth.
- It's near the station.
- OK.
You'll be detained here,
what you did
is a crime anyway.
We still need to understand
the gravity of this prank
when the kid shows up.
If you please, citizen.
Any news, chief?
No, mr. Bernardo. Unfortunately,
no news of the girl for now.
I asked you to come back
because I need
details about your involvement
with Rosa, I want to understand.
It was just
a normal affair, chief.
It just happened, sex
without emotional attachment...
Routine.
Men stuff,
it's inevitable, it just happens
to us, you know how it's like.
No, I don't, mr. Bernardo.
I met Rosa
at Oswaldo Cruz Station.
I never hid from her
that I had a wife and daughter.
Never.
- Mom?
- Hi, honey.
I'll be right there.
Good morning, honey.
Let daddy sleep some more.
Bro, I don't even wanna argue.
I've had enough of soccer.
We can't even make a team.
Speaking of which,
there will be a rematch.
- I can't come, man.
- Why not?
- I work.
- It's your day off. I checked.
I work, buddy.
As far as Sylvia knows, I work.
Bro, you really are
a motherfucker...
What's the catch, Bernardo?
I've got some tail, buddy.
I need her full profile now.
Cute, from Marechal, met her
at the station, foxy, hot...
- And the baby's name?
- Rosa.
Rosa... When will you
introduce her to me?
Never. You're a vulture,
I'm a hawk. Fuck no.
- Stop being so individualist...
- What...?
Don't you tell anyone...
I won't fucking say anything,
it's in the vault.
But tell her to get me
two pretty ladies...
Who was it?
I don't know.
Why didn't you pick up?
I need to sleep, honey. I get up
early tomorrow for work.
But at this time of night,
Bernardo? Who'd call?
- How would I know...
- Wrong number?
Or maybe Andre, bugging me
at a time like this...
Let me see.
What do you mean,
"Let me see?"
You'll do no such thing.
Why, are you
hiding anything?
No, I'm not. You know I hate
people messing with my phone.
We talked about it,
did you forget?
- No, I didn't.
- Fine, then.
Then look
and see who it was.
I don't know that number.
Then call back
and ask who it is.
I'm not going to call.
It could be important...
- Then he'll call again!
- OK...
OK!
- Good night.
- Good night, wife. I love you.
Are you keeping
the light on?
Are you sleeping
holding on to your phone?
Aren't you going to sleep?
I lost my sleep.
Smoking in the bedroom,
is that it?
Smoking in the bedroom, Sylvia?!
I've asked not to before!
It's going
to leave a smell.
Now you're turning that on?
Why turn it on, Sylvia?
It will just spread the...
- That's PMS.
- I wish.
Then you have
nothing better to do.
Perhaps.
It's too much
energy to spend...
I know, bottled energy...
My husband only sleeps...
The one who gave up
on using this bed for other
things except sleep was you.
Do you wanna argue?
Weren't you sleepy?
Do you wanna fight?
I don't want you
to end your marriage.
I just want us
not to stop being...
I want us to keep
seeing each other.
I don't know
if I want it anymore.
No, baby. Stop that.
Stop that...
Let's see each other...
Come on...
Let's meet tomorrow.
Tomorrow at 6:30
in front of the apartment, OK?
Is that a yes?
Yeah?
Tomorrow.
6:30 at the apartment, OK?
God...
I didn't know it was that easy
to buy a weapon nowadays...
What are you talking about,
little one?
Yeah... I thought a license
was necessary...
It should be.
What do you mean, "gun license"?
Do you want to buy a gun?
I already bought it.
- You bought a gun...
- I did.
A revolver.
Very small...
Woman-like.
What...?
You're not joking,
you're serious?
You bought a gun?
Why?
You're scaring me... Why,
why did you buy a gun?
- Personal defense.
- "Personal defense"?
You're going
to walk around with a gun?
Going everywhere with a gun?
I don't know...
"I don't know"?
That's a crime!
You can't do that,
you could be arrested.
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?
Arrested and handcuffed...
Well, it would
solve your problem... Right?
I bought one.
Don't joke with me,
I'm getting scared.
You bought a gun,
just like that?
You have a gun right here?
In your purse?
Is the gun here?
In your purse?
Don't look at me like that,
stop scaring me.
Do you have one?
Answer me!
Isn't the girl going to eat?
Playing ball
at dinner time...
Is this how you raised her?
Yes, the same as you, honey.
Clarinha, please stop
with the ball, honey,
- come have dinner with daddy.
- Dad...
Actually,
who got her this ball?
That friend of Rita's, Silvia.
Remember her?
No.
She goes to a dentist nearby
and sometimes she drops by.
She brought Clarinha a ball,
she likes her.
I don't know Rita's friends.
What's her name?
- Silvia.
- Silvia is your name.
I know it is,
but she's also Silvia.
Hers is with an "I",
mine is with a "Y".
What does she look like?
Well, Bernardo...
She's pretty, young...
White skin, short hair,
red-headed, a mole on the lip.
Pretty.
I don't know any
pretty red-heads with moles,
be careful.
I don't know that woman.
Don't accept
anything else from her.
Don't let her in this house.
If she insists, call the police.
You're overreacting, Bernardo.
She's telling the truth.
- She's not.
- How can you be so sure?
I don't know, but we see
such atrocities on the TV...
We should be careful
about that woman,
we shouldn't
trust strangers...
Evil comes
from unexpected places.
Fine, Bernardo. Fine.
Promise me you won't
meet her again.
I promise.
After that,
I barely saw Rosa.
Until yesterday, when she called
arranging to meet
at Oswaldo Cruz station,
tonight at 7.
And were you going?
Sure, she said
it was the last time.
And you believed her?
Mr. Bernardo, anything else
you'd like to add...
Anything I need to know?
I don't know.
There's something, but I
don't think it means anything.
- Well, if it doesn't...
- Maybe.
Tell me, citizen.
I got a phone call not
a long time ago from a woman,
she said her husband
or boyfriend...
According to her, that man
was my wife's lover.
They'd meet in the afternoon
while I was working,
but I didn't
believe it too much.
I'm sure
this is Rosa's thing,
that she asked
a skank friend to call me.
Just to bother me.
Rosa was already crazy.
And that person,
what did she want?
Just to tell you that?
She wanted to scare me, she said
if I went home they'd be in bed.
I hung up.
Don't you think
it can be true somehow?
No, I'm sure Sylvia
would never cheat on me.
So, you're telling me
all this... why?
OK, let's see. Mr. Bernardo,
did this person who called you
give you a name?
Can you remember it?
I think I remember...
It was a short name...
Bia...
Beth...
I don't know, chief, it could be
another name. Jane...
Bel, Beth... I don't know,
I just remember it was short.
- OK. And she didn't call again?
- Never again.
OK...
Mr. Bernardo,
I think that's it.
If you want to go home and rest,
you can take your wife...
If we hear anything,
we'll contact you.
Thank you.
Excuse me, commissioner.
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
I know that woman.
What is she doing here?
Is she involved
in my daughter's disappearance?
We're still checking that.
Where do you know her from?
She's a friend.
Silvia, my friend.
- And you've known her for...?
- For a short while.
Where did you
meet her, exactly?
In the neighborhood,
she went to a dentist close by.
She's a friend
of a good friend of ours, Rita.
An old friend of Bernardo's.
- Are you sure of that?
- Yes, I'm sure.
I mean, no...
I don't know...
When we met,
I didn't recognize her at first,
but I don't believe...
I don't believe
she's involved with Clarinha's
disappearance, it's not...
Why didn't you tell me
about this woman before?
I need to talk to you.
Excuse me for a moment.
What have we got?
We combed
the whole neighborhood.
No one ever heard of a Beth
or someone
with that crazy description.
Here's what you'll do:
Tell them to continue
the search, she may show up.
Then take Sylvia
and finish her statement.
OK, got it.
I'm getting sick of it, I'm
becoming a couple's therapist.
I didn't join
the Force for this.
Right...
Inspector, ask someone
to bring me some coffee, please.
And that bitch too,
I'll put some pressure on her.
Let's do it.
Do you know what this is?
Coffee.
Very good. Coffee.
But not normal coffee.
This is police coffee.
Meaning,
it's a shitty coffee...
Warm...
And I hope, Rosa, you'll tell me
everything I want to know
before this coffee gets cold.
But since this coffee
is really shitty, I'll have
to drink it slowly,
one sip at a time.
Meaning:
It will get cold faster.
I don't understand...
Where are you getting at
with this coffee story?
What I'm trying to say is
you shouldn't waste your time,
better yet, my time,
trying to fool me.
We've been through
that whole area,
we know there's no Beth, she's
a figment of your imagination.
A good one, by the way.
Congratulations.
They didn't search properly.
Rosa...
You've probably seen on TV,
on the papers, magazines...
Books... Do you read books?
Fine. You've probably
seen on TV,
that the police is not
usually friendly,
condescending or nice to people
who try to fool the police.
In here, shit gets real.
Of course, sometimes
we get an innocent one,
we beat his ass, and then
the politicians come,
the NGOs, human rights...
They all show up
to make some noise.
But sometimes we get lucky
and get a scumbag.
A criminal.
Like you.
Just like yourself.
And then...
No one feels sorry.
Meaning: I can do with you
whatever I want
so you tell me
what I want to listen.
I can break your teeth,
your fingers...
No one will complain,
you know why?
Because happily,
in this country, in this city:
Rapists, elderly beaters
people who mistreat children,
crimes against children...
Fera da Penha, Fera de Duque
de Caxias, Maluco de Realengo...
No one feels sorry for them.
People will knock on our door
asking to lynch you.
But I can make it easy for you
if you collaborate. So...
I'll tell you.
Please.
I didn't tell the whole truth
but I didn't lie.
This Beth exists, I just don't
know if her name's really Beth.
Do you want to know
where the girl is?
She's safe.
No one will harm her.
I'll tell you everything.
Are you following me?
- Me?
- Yeah.
No.
Too bad.
I mean, maybe...
- Are you or aren't you?
- I am.
What for?
Just to know your name.
- Just my name?
- Yeah.
- Dahlia.
- Dahlia?
What a different name...
Pretty name.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm lying, it's Rosa.
I knew it wasn't!
Rosa? Mine's Bernardo.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Did you just want
to know my name?
For starters.
And you...
Where are you going?
- Home.
- Home? Where do you live?
- Marechal.
- Marechal?
If you go to the next station
with me, I can give you a ride.
Don't look at me like that,
my car's old but it's...
A sports car, stylish...
You'll like it.
Does it smell of gasoline?
My car?
It does...
It does?
Well, I won't deny it,
it's old, so it smells of gas...
I go crazy on gas smell.
Are you kidding me?
You like the gas smell?
I do...
So... Perfect.
I don't really understand
cars or brands...
I won't know
which one it is.
No need, you just have to like
the gas smell. Are you in?
OK, you're in. Let's go.
I'll tell you everything.
We'll keep
each other company.
Fine.
Bernardo.
Rosa.
- Is this your apartment?
- No.
- No?
- No.
Why didn't you take me
to your home?
- Do you live with someone?
- I do.
- With whom?
- With my mom.
Aren't you a little old
to live with your mom?
My mom's very lonely...
Lonely, old...
She's sick. She needs
someone to take care of her.
I see...
To our meeting.
- Whose apartment is this?
- A friend's.
Is he coming soon?
No, he practically lives
in his girlfriend's house.
We have it all to ourselves.
Beautiful.
Do we have all night?
Practically. More or less.
What do you mean,
"more or less"?
I need to get back home,
I can't leave my mom alone.
OK...
Is this your uniform?
Yeah...
Did you like it?
- What is this?
- Curious girl...
Do you work in this company?
- Yeah...
- Doing what?
It says, right there.
Are you a bus driver?
I'm not a bus driver,
I'm their boss.
So important...
I'm sorry!
I knocked my glass,
let's just put it here.
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.
You look hot in this shirt.
I look a lot better
without it.
Oh, yeah? Let me see...
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Do you work here?
- I do.
- Vanderley.
- Wanderley. Wander...
Wander...
- Listen, do you know Bernardo?
- Bernardo?
Of course, Bernardo...
- Can you get him for me?
- I can't.
- Why not?
- He already left.
I don't know his schedule...
Usually it's really
around this time,
but today he had to leave.
- His wife called, he had to...
- What wife?
Well, his wife.
- Is he married?
- Very married.
No, I'm talking about
a Bernardo from Sao Paulo...
Yes, from Sao Paulo.
Bernardo, from Sao Paulo.
That's him.
Same guy. My friend.
Is he really married?
Are you sure?
He is...
- What's your name?
- Rosa.
Rosa...
You really are pretty!
He told me about you.
About you two...
- Did he?
- He did. You're his fling.
And he didn't tell you
he's married... Son of a bitch.
Don't you tell him
I told you.
You didn't hear this from me.
He's my friend.
Keep it to yourself, OK?
You did me a favor.
It's cool.
Bye, I have to go.
- Why did you lie to me?
- I lied to you?
You said you lived
with your sick mother...
I know you have a wife
and a small daughter.
I didn't want
to lose you, Rosa.
I thought if I told you
right away you'd leave.
That's the only reason.
I'm sorry.
I didn't lie, I just...
I wasn't going
to tell you now.
And when would you tell me?
Huh?
You'd fuck me until you had
enough and then you'd tell me.
Not a chance.
I really like you.
I really do...
I don't think
we met by accident.
I really like you,
I just didn't want
to miss this opportunity,
that's all.
- And your wife?
- What about my wife?
Do you like your wife?
I love my wife.
I don't know what will happen
from now on with us.
But I really want you.
I want to enjoy this,
I want to be with you,
I don't know our future,
I don't know anything.
Just let it happen.
We can be together.
It's nice.
We'll have fun.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Really.
I don't like lies.
Neither do I.
I don't mind
being your lover. For now.
After a while, I don't know
what will happen.
If I will still want it...
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
But I want you
to promise me one thing:
Whatever you want.
You won't lie to me again.
I won't lie to you again,
I promise.
And you won't
stop seeing me.
Never. Little girl,
I'll never stop seeing you.
Really.
I want you.
- Don't worry about that...
- No, no, no...
- Let's use it.
- I'm on the pill.
- There are no chances, I swear.
- I don't know...
- Just come...
- Don't...
- It's better...
- Don't do this...
Don't do this to me...
I wish I could get
a two-month vacation.
I'd get my car and drive
up the coast until Recife.
You know?
Stopping every time...
No stress, no headache...
Just really enjoying it.
Free, without any problems...
- I really wanted that.
- Go, then.
But, hey:
We wouldn't sleep in hotels,
we wouldn't sleep in inns,
we wouldn't sleep anywhere.
Just here, like this.
In the car.
- Just like this?
- Like a gypsy, like this.
 Fine...
Looking at the stars,
smelling the ocean...
Together.
You and me, close,
next to each other...
- Me?
- Of course.
Come with me.
- I'm in.
- Let's go?
Delicious.
- And your wife?
- What about her?
What excuse would you
make up for her?
I don't know.
I don't.
Sometimes I do that too,
I make plans with you...
I know I shouldn't, but...
It happens.
When I realize it,
I'm thinking...
Do you think that's bad?
But you don't think
I should fool myself...
Let's go get some ice cream...
Any flavor you want.
- Sylvia?
- Yes, that's me.
- Sylvia... Clarinha!
- Yeah...
Wow, what a coincidence!
- You don't remember me.
- No. I'm sorry, you're...
- Silvia.
- Yes, I'm Sylvia.
- No, I'm Silvia too.
- Oh, sorry.
- I'm Rita's friend, remember?
- Rita's...?
- Yes, Rita.
- Rita... Little Rita?
- Yes, Little Rita!
- From high school?
- High school, exactly.
- Wow... Did you go there too?
No, but we met one day, girl!
It was you, me, Clarinha...
She's so pretty,
with that same face...
But she was younger then...
I'm sorry, help me...
Where did we meet?
Your husband was there, too.
What was his name?
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo, exactly.
I think it was
at St. Penha's party.
But, wow... What a coincidence
I ran into you here.
I'm so glad, I've been walking
but I can't find...
Could you give me
a glass of water?
Of course, no problem.
Come, honey. Let's get
her some water.
- I'll be out in a second.
- Can I ask for another favor?
I mean,
if it's not a bother...
I kinda have to go...
Can I use your bathroom?
- Sure.
- Really? Won't it be a bother?
No, come in.
You don't have
visitors, do you?
No, I was just home
all day with my daughter.
Thank you, such a relief...
Don't worry.
- Your house's so pretty...
- Don't mind the mess.
- Wow, such a great space...
- Yeah, it's great.
- You can't see it from outside.
- You really can't... It's good.
I'm just making some coffee.
Don't you want to sit down?
- Really? Won't I be a bother?
- Don't worry, come on.
- Have you seen Rita?
- No. It's been a long time.
- Me, too... A long time.
- I miss her.
Yeah... I don't even know what
she's doing, where she lives.
Do you know
if she's still with that guy?
- As far as I know...
- As far as you know?
What? Yes or no?
God, what a question...
Those two kept fighting,
- breaking up, going back...
- Yeah, right?
- And... Do you live nearby?
- No.
- But I go to a dentist nearby.
- Oh, really?
- 2 streets from here.
- A dentist, here?
There is, yeah...
And do you have
to go back there often?
Root canal, yeah...
I have to.
Yeah, it takes a long time...
Well...
If you're ever around
and you need anything...
- Thank you.
- Don't worry.
- Such a coincidence, huh?
- Tell me about it.
- Damn...
- Rita's friend...
Right?
I think it's going
to pour today.
Do you think your wife
is suspicious of us?
I do.
And does she accept it?
In a way... She doesn't
give it to me at home...
Aren't you afraid
she'll get a lover, too?
Sylvia...?
I doubt it.
If I were you I'd be
careful about that certainty.
Enough chatter. Come.
Enough talk, come.
What is this?!
Stop, stop, stop...
I even lost track
of the game...
- I lost...
- Wait, I think I'm dizzy.
- Really?
- Really.
Do you have
low blood pressure?
No, it's just... Sometimes,
when I drink, I get sick.
Wait, let me get you
some water.
Wow...
Sylvia, I'm feeling sick,
I think I'm going to vomit.
Don't vomit in front of me,
I'm terrified of vomit.
- No, it's serious...
- Here.
Drink it.
Thank you.
- Best thing there is.
- What?
Water...
Don't you want
to take a shower?
No, it's not necessary...
Take a shower,
you'll feel fresh, I'm sure.
So?
- Do you think?
- Sure. I'll get you a towel.
- Are you feeling better?
- More or less.
Yeah? Don't you
want to lie down?
- It's not necessary...
- Lie down, it'll do you good.
OK, but... What side
do you sleep on?
You can pick either one,
it's not a problem.
- That's the one I sleep.
- Yeah?
You know, even I
feel a little queasy...
Lie down for a bit.
I think I still have time
before picking Clarinha up.
Slut.
Dirty. Filthy!
- Never dare see my wife again!
- What are you talking about?
- "What are you talking about?"
- Stop, stop!
What did you do?
Don't act innocent.
Why did you go there?
- Why did you go there?!
- Let me go!
Do you think this is a joke?
Do you?
- Should I let you go?
- Let me go.
Do you? Do you want me to?
You don't.
You don't want me to let you go.
If I let you go, you'll
never see my face again.
Do that. Go!
Get out of my life!
Is that what you want?
That's not!
You want me inside you.
Slut!
- Take off your panties.
- Stop.
- Take off your fucking panties!
- Stop!
Take off your panties!
Come on, quick!
These fucking panties...
Spread your legs.
- Spread your fucking legs.
- No, no...
- Spread your legs!
- No, stop... Stop!
Then spread them.
More. Let me see inside.
Spread them.
Now say it.
Do you want another beating?
Say what you want.
- I want to leave.
- Leave, my ass!
You want me inside you!
Come closer...
Now repeat after me.
"I want you to fuck me."
- I want you to fuck me.
- Louder!
- I want you to fuck me.
- Yes.
Now ask.
- "Please. Please."
- Please.
Yes... Now say it.
"Please, I want you
to fuck me."
Please, I want you
to fuck me.
- "For the rest of my life."
- For the rest of my life.
Now all together.
"I want you to fuck me
for the rest of my life!"
Please, I want you to fuck me
for the rest of my life.
You wish.
Stop, stop...
Promise me you'll
never look for my wife?
Promise me?
Do you sell payphone cards?
We have small,
medium and large.
Give me a large one.
And a soda, too.
- Can I talk to you a minute?
- Fuck, girl, what is it?
If it's those gospel conversion
things, go find someone else.
No, I'm not like that,
don't worry.
Amen, Jesus, good for you.
I'm far from pure,
go somewhere else,
don't fuck with my patience.
I just wanted
to ask you for a favor.
Fuck, I must be a lighting rod
for crazies. What do you want?
Could you make me
a phone call?
Are you trying
to scam me, girl?
Not you.
It's fast. Here...
I'll give you this.
Hello? Darling...
Are you gonna keep
suggesting me?
Hey, Bernardo...
This is Beth here.
No, you don't know me
but I know your skanky wife,
that bitch Sylvia,
who's been hitting on my man,
fucking and having an affair
with him for a while now.
Do you doubt it?
Then leave and...
Leave your job now
and go to your house.
See if she's not fucking
my man in your bed, you cuckold.
That's why you're a cuckold.
If you don't fix her, I will.
I'll break her teeth, she'll
swallow them with her food.
She's good with her ass
but not with her food.
Who the fuck is Rosa, boy?
I'm not Rosa, my name's Beth.
I told you...
If being a cuckold's
not enough, you're deaf.
He hung up.
- That's fine.
- Should I call again?
Tell me.
I want to tell you
something, but...
I hope you don't
get me wrong.
Don't worry, tell me.
I don't know
if you've realized,
but ever since we
started hanging out...
- I changed a bit.
- You have a new haircut.
Yeah, that too...
That didn't change
a lot, actually.
I actually just want
to thank you.
- What for?
- I don't know, I think...
You gave me
that push, you know?
My relationship with Bernardo,
it's at a place
where we either stick together
or we split, you know?
- I do...
- Yeah.
But I'm also to blame,
I wasn't very nice to him.
I kinda lost
my lust for him.
- It's normal in long marriages.
- I know it's normal, but...
He started being distant
because of that, you know?
But recently our relationship
started changing.
I think it's because
you showed up.
- Me?
- Yeah.
You... Spending
time together, you know...
I don't know.
He started realizing I'm not
so irritating, I'm more open.
And yesterday,
when he got home,
we had sex in a way,
Silvia...
Like we hadn't in years,
you know? Like that...
I think our love
is much stronger now.
It's closer, I don't know...
I think you're...
a bit responsible
for all these changes.
Crazy, huh?
Do you think it's stupid?
No...
What are you doing here?
Come here.
Rosa, come here!
- You're avoiding me.
- Avoiding?
I told you
not to come to my street.
Tell me what are you
doing here?! Get in.
- Why are you here?
- You're avoiding me.
I'm not, I just didn't
have time lately. That's all.
Get in. Get in,
Rosa, get in!
Say it.
You know you want to.
You don't want us anymore
and you're not brave to say it.
I just need
some time to think, Rosa.
About what?
You know what you want.
How can you say that?
Do you ever think about
leaving your wife to be with me?
- Do you?
- No.
Honey, your marriage is over,
anyone can see that.
- Give us a chance.
- Are you crazy?
Why insist on something
without a future?
That's exactly
what I've been thinking.
I'm the one that has
no future for you?
Is that it?
- My period's late.
- What?
- Yeah.
- What did you say?
- It's late.
- What do you mean, "It's late"?
You're on the pill,
you told me you were.
I am, but sometimes I forget...
- How can you forget?!
Rosa, how do you forget this,
this is not a joke!
It's not a joke,
this can't be happening!
You know what you'll do
if it's true, right?
- What?
- Rosa, I have a family!
I have a daughter,
I have a fucking life!
I can't keep putting
kids in the world.
- Do you want me to take it out?
- It's the only way.
I don't know if I want to.
What...? You don't know
if you want to?
You don't even know
if you're pregnant!
You don't...
Get out of the car.
- Here?
- Get out. Right here.
Wait...
Look for a drug store,
take the test
and only come back
with the results. Go!
Get out! Go!
You're crazy, go!
I'll pee my pants...
- Hang on!
- I can't, God...
- Rosa...
- In a second!
Finally, Bernardo.
I took the drug store test.
It's positive.
I wasn't about to joke
with this, it's serious.
I won't take it out,
I'm having this child
and you won't stop me.
Don't worry, he won't
know who the father is.
You can have your family,
your life, your wife...
Maybe even I will forget
who the father is.
Don't come looking for me.
I accept being without you
but I want this child.
I won't pick up
your phone calls.
I don't want to talk anymore,
if you insist I'll move.
Erase my number
from your phone.
Don't worry, leave it to me.
Yes?
Good afternoon,
may I speak to Rosa?
Just a minute, please.
Rosa.
Rosa.
Rosa...
There's a man
who wants to talk to you.
Come on, honey, go!
- Hi.
- Hi.
What do you want?
I want to talk to you.
Can we?
OK, speak.
- Come closer.
- You can talk from there.
Calm down, woman.
It's just a talk, come.
Let's talk. Properly.
Come on... Just a little.
There. Speak.
Not with this gate...
Come outside, come on.
What do you want?
I'm worried about you.
It's true,
I'm worried about you.
I want to take you
to a real doctor.
These drug store tests
are not reliable.
- I know.
- So, let's go to a doctor.
I have a friend who's a doctor,
he'll do the proper tests.
So we know
if you're pregnant or not.
- I'm not taking it out.
- I'm not saying that.
Let's go with me.
We'll do the exams first.
We can't keep discussing
over a hypothesis.
We go, check it out...
We don't even know
if it's true.
We'll talk afterwards.
Let's go...
- What, now?
- Now. His schedule just opened.
Let's take the tests
and rest our minds...
Come on.
Put your shoes on
and let's go.
Linhares.
Long time no see...
This is Rosa.
Come in, please.
Hello.
Are you afraid
of drawing blood?
I'm just a bit scared
of needles, but that's normal.
I know what it's like.
Just look over there,
sometimes you can
get impressed...
Just look at that fellow there.
What...? Wait, get it out!
Wait... Stop, stop!
Put her on top here...
Calm down...
What have you done to me?
Hey.
Hey...
You'll be alright...
Easy...
Now rest.
Good night.
Faster. Faster!
Be careful! Hold on...
Silvia!
Girl, you disappeared!
- I was sick.
- Oh, really?
- Was it serious?
- No. It's gone.
- Have a seat, let's chat.
- Where's Clarinha?
Over there, with her friends.
- I brought her a gift.
- Honey... Really?
Hi, Clarinha!
Do you remember mommy's friend?
Do you remember me?
Hi, auntie...
I brought you a gift.
Wow, look...
What could it be?
- Open it!
- Stop swinging so you can open.
What could it be?
It's wrapped...
Let mommy hold the box.
Get it.
Look, guys!
What is it?
So pretty!
Bernardo, I want
to ask you something.
I know things
are not good between us.
I know you're tired of it all,
and so am I,
but I'd like to ask you
for one last date.
I don't know what
will happen, if we'll just
look at each other,
if we'll talk...
If we'll kiss and make love,
I don't know.
But I want to see you
one last time.
And I promise I'll
never look for you again.
One last date, tomorrow at 7.
At the station we met.
I peed my pants...
Just now?
But... Why didn't you
tell me you had to go?
Come here, come here.
Quick.
This'll do, right?
Do you want
anything to drink?
- I do.
- What do you want?
- An orange juice.
- May I help you?
I'd like an orange juice.
Do you have it?
- Yes.
- How much is it?
R$2,00.
- Thank you.
- Can you wait for me here?
Stay here, OK?
Let's go? Come.
Will you let me cut
a lock of your hair?
What for?
As a souvenir.
Will you let me?
- I will.
- Then turn around.
Just stand still, OK?
It'll be very small...
Look straight ahead.
Hi, honey.
Good evening.
Good evening, mom.
- Are you hungry?
- No.
There's meat in the fridge.
There's rice, beans...
I can fry an egg,
if you want.
- Yes?
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- I'd like to talk, please.
Rosa.
Rosa, my daughter,
they want to talk to you.
Rosa...
Rosa, come...
The declarant,
Rosa Maria Correa,
also said she doesn't
regret what she did
and doesn't want
to talk about it anymore.
When asked
where the revolver came from,
she answered: "It's easier
to get one than you think."
She stated she's not interested
in knowing what happens to her,
that she doesn't want a lawyer
or any kind of defense
because she's aware of the
responsibility of her actions
and she doesn't want
anyone's forgiveness.
She said no more.
