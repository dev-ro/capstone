I've got it.
Give us a hand.
You know, you'll get caught
one of these days,
and when you are, you'll be for it.
What's that smell?
Is it him or you?
Won't make any difference then
who or what you are, you'll be for it.
Well, come on, then,
help me get him inside.
Oh, no.
What's the matter, man?
Afraid?
I've been in there once.
What are you afraid of, in God's name?
What's in there.
Now, give me me money, and I'll be off.
And when you've drunk that,
come back and see me.
I might have another job for you!
Give me a schnapps, quick.
I've got the money.
Here.
Another.
Evening, sergeant.
Evening.
Listen, before you turn me in,
I've got something to tell ya.
Yes.
That should do it nicely.
My God.
Open up!
Open up!
Is there anybody in there?
Ah...
Anyone there?
It's Ruth.
Give that to me.
Eh?
Please give that to me.
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Careful.
You bloody fool.
I... l-I don't know
who you are, sir.
If you could only appreciate the difficulty
in finding specimens like these.
I should like an explanation.
Ruined.
Quite ruined.
An explanation of...
of all this.
What?
What were you intending
to do with all these...
bits and pieces, sir?
If you must know,
I'm going to stitch them together.
Stitch?
To create a new man, Officer.
Create?
A new man.
I arrest you, sir, for sorcery.
For what?
Sorcery, sir.
You admit to attempting
to resurrect the dead, sir.
Yes, but...
Sorcery, sir.
Come with me, please.
You must come with me, sir.
Simon Helder,
you have been found guilty
of one the vilest of crimes.
How a young man
of your breeding and education
could fall so low as to contaminate himself
with this...
this disgusting performance.
Skeletons?
Eyeballs?
I am a doctor, you know.
I don't know.
Where is your practice?
I see no record of it.
I've been engaged in research.
For the good of mankind.
But I am qualified.
That makes your behavior
even more despicable.
If we cannot trust even
our so-called
enlightened men of science
to behave in a manner proper to a decent
and God-fearing citizen,
then who are we to trust?
All I was...
If you speak again,
I shall increase your sentence.
Is that understood?
In fact, we have a precedent to your case.
I find that some years ago
a certain baron was sentenced by this court
for a very similar offense.
Baron?
Who?
That is no concern of yours.
Frankenstein.
You appear to have heard of him.
I'm not surprised.
I have all his books...
his lectures to the academy.
To return to your case,
as I say, I have decided
to extend my leniency to its limits
by only sentencing you
to be committed to the state asylum
for the criminally insane
for a period of five years,
after which you will be examined
by a medical board
to report on your mental condition.
And if,
and only if that report is satisfactory,
will you be released.
Rather you than me, son.
Well?
Well, we got another one for you.
What is it?
Young man.
Violent?
Oh-ho.
Like a lamb.
You said that about the last one.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry about that.
He was quiet enough in there.
But this one's all right.
Gentry, I wouldn't wonder.
Often the worst.
All right, son, this is it.
Home from home.
Come on.
That won't be necessary.
I say what's necessary here.
Oh, good luck, son.
There's really no need.
I say what the needs are here.
Get on.
I wish to see the director.
You what?
- I wish to see the director.
- Keep your voice down.
Look, I don't know who
you bloody think you are.
And I'm not moving till I have.
Come in, come in.
I think you heard what he said.
C-Come here, my dear.
L-I have something
to show you.
Am I addressing the director?
Who the devil are you?
Dr. Helder.
A doctor?
Oh. They didn't tell me
they were sending a doctor.
I see.
It's r-really
not at all convenient.
I'm sorry.
I really only want some information.
L-Information?
Well, of course,
I shall be only too happy to supply you
with any information you may require.
Only too happy, naturally.
My paperwork is a little behind.
We've been very busy, you know.
Oh, very, very busy.
But I'm sure we'll be able
to sort out anything
you may want to know between us, eh?
Will you join me in a drink?
That's most kind of you.
Thank you.
The information I want
is about Baron Frankenstein.
F-Frankenstein?
Yes.
I believe he was...
shall we say "a resident" here
for some time?
Oh, he was, h-he was,
but he's... but he's dead.
Died some time ago.
I see.
L-I have papers to prove it.
Death certificate.
A-And you can see the grave.
Oh, I don't think that'll be necessary,
but thank you for your courtesy.
Most kind.
Oh... not at all.
My dear fellow.
You... you, you're one of them.
If by "one of them" you mean a prisoner,
then... yes, I am.
You, you... how dare you
come in here?!
How...?! Ernst!
Herr Director?
What the devil
do you think you're playing at,
letting this in here?
But you told him to come in, Herr Director.
I didn't know
he was an inmate then, you dolt.
I'm sorry, Herr Director.
Well, get him out!
Out! Out!
At once, Herr Director.
I am surrounded by fools.
I did tell you there's no need.
Quiet. I think this young man
needs a lesson taught him, eh, Hans?
I think the initiation
treatment, don't you?
Is it compulsory?
Oh, yes.
First, we give you a bath.
Come along, my pretties.
Have a nice little treat for you.
Something you'll enjoy.
Make you laugh.
Come along there, lovely.
In you come.
There we are.
Over you go. Lovely.
Come on, come on, my lovelies.
In you come.
Come, move along, there.
Come. Come along.
In you come.
Oh, you're going to enjoy
yourselves, my pretties.
Come on, angel, you, too.
Move aside.
Give the angel a good view.
Now, be patient, my pretties.
I won't be long.
You do really look remarkable...
So glad you like it.
I always rather fancied myself in blue.
You did order a bath,
young sir, didn't you?
Hans, give the gentleman his bath.
Enjoying that, are you, my lovelies?
Told you you would, didn't I?
My mother used to say
that cleanliness is next to Godliness.
Go on, lads, give 'em a bit of a show.
Oh, that's nice, isn't it?
He's going to be nice and clean,
nice and clean,
and we all like to be nice and clean.
It's quite right to have a bath.
Oh, that's lovely,
yes, it is.
It's a bit rough sometimes, but...
Doctor.
Go back to your rooms now.
There's nothing more for you to see.
It's all over.
Quietly. Don't rush.
Sarah?
Sarah, take him to my surgery, please.
See that he dries himself,
and put some salve on those abrasions.
You will follow me.
Wait.
What the devil...?
You may find it impossible
to restrain yourself,
but you will not behave like an animal
towards my patients.
How dare you?!
I dare because they are my patients...
mine, not yours.
I have accepted
full responsibility for them.
If you want that responsibility
returned to you,
then just carry on behaving as you are.
My dear doctor...
Come along, Gerda, you can go now.
All right.
It's all right. There.
Hans, take this young lady to her room.
Yes, Herr Doctor.
Not you.
Stay here.
If that happens again,
I shall leave this place.
But how can you leave?
Quite simply.
By walking out of the door.
The baron is dead, remember?
We killed him.
As resident doctor,
I can leave here whenever I choose.
Oh, my dear Victor, I...
uh, Dr. Victor.
It won't happen again,
I can assure you absolutely.
I mean, the girl came in here
asking me for my help,
and before I knew
what was happening, she...
I don't want to hear your excuses...
Excuses?
...even if I were
to believe them.
I came to see you about another matter.
Two of your thugs
have been maltreating our new arrival.
Who?
The young man?
Yes. I have warned you
about it before.
As director of this asylum,
you are responsible
for the conduct of your staff,
is that not so?
Well, yes, I...
In here.
The... doctor tells me
that you've been maltreating
one of the patients.
We just gave him a bath, Herr Director.
With the fire hose?
You're fined a week's pay and lose
your privileges.
But it was Hans that did it.
Then you're both fined. Out!
It's... just a matter
of showing them who's master.
Well, will you join me in a brandy?
You're looking a little tired.
I hadn't expected you back
so soon.
Neither had they, apparently.
Quite.
I came back early
because I was unable to collect
the medical supplies
I'd ordered in Carlsbad.
They refused to let me take them
because the last consignment
has not yet been paid for.
You must admit that some of the items
were... unusual, Doctor.
You see, the... the allowance
that our very generous state gives us
is for the usual medical supplies...
ointments, lotions, bandages...
that sort of thing.
But not for some of the things listed here.
The state also makes an allowance
for library books...
books for the patients,
not collector's items
such as you have here,
like this.
Uh...
You've made your point.
The account will be settled.
When?
T-Tomorrow.
At what time?
Before noon.
Will that satisfy you?
You really are looking very tired.
Overwork, that's what that is.
You need an assistant.
Would you like me
to advertise for one for you?
No, thank you.
Well, as-as you will.
Now I'll have that brandy.
Oh, you'll join me. Good.
No, I won't join you.
I'll take it with me.
I have work to do.
Who taught you to do this, hmm?
Sarah?
How do you come to be here?
Won't you speak to me?
Can you speak?
No, she cannot speak.
She's known as "the angel."
Very apt.
That is very good, Sarah.
Drink this.
Brandy.
The best.
Don't talk.
Now, just sit in that chair,
cross your legs and relax.
I'm perfectly sane.
I'll be the judge of that.
Now, just face the light, please.
Keep your eyes open.
Now, I want you to look
at the point of my finger
and follow it with your eyes.
Why are you here?
Isn't that obvious?
Just answer my question, please.
For the same reason as Baron Frankenstein.
Kindly explain yourself.
I was sentenced by the same
court, for the same crime:
Sorcery.
You are Baron Frankenstein, aren't you?
Yes, I am.
I've studied all your published works.
I've even performed
some of your experiments,
without much success, I'm afraid.
I always wanted to meet you...
Before we continue this discussion,
there are two points I should explain.
First, Baron Frankenstein is dead.
He is buried in the courtyard out there.
Is that clear?
Perfectly.
Good.
Who else knows about you?
The director, a few of the staff.
Doesn't that make you feel
a little insecure?
Before he passed on,
Baron Frankenstein recorded a few notes
on the way in which the
director and his cronies
run this institution.
The baron's secret is quite safe.
Do you understand that, too?
I do.
What am I to call you then, Baron?
By my name.
Victor.
Dr. Carl Victor.
I see.
And the second point,
Dr. Victor?
If you are to assist me in my work,
you must do so with diligence and devotion.
Assist you?
From what you told me,
am I correct in assuming
that you have studied medicine?
Yes, in fact...
You have passed your third year?
With honors.
Oh, congratulations.
Then you are a doctor in your own right.
Good.
You can help me with my practice here.
Oh... practice.
I am resident medical practitioner
for this establishment.
How I came to hold that position
is a long story,
which I may tell you one day,
but... hold it, I do.
If I find you reliable,
I shall hand over the practice
to you completely.
What is your name,
by the way?
Helder.
Simon Helder.
That will enable me to devote more time
to other work.
What work is that, Baron?
Dr. Victor.
My own private work.
I'm do... just off to a little,
...musical evening.
I found an assistant.
You found one? Where?
Here. A Dr. Helder.
Helder?
That...
but he's...
An inmate, yes.
You will sign this, if you please,
accepting his appointment.
But if he's mad, I...
No more than you or I.
I'm putting him in a room
close to my surgery.
You can't!
He will start first thing tomorrow.
Dr. Helder?
Good morning.
Good morning, sir.
Let her carry it.
I shall take you around
to see everything once,
after that, you'll be on your own.
I see.
Shall I have Sarah to help me?
When she's not assisting me, yes.
You'll learn.
I had to.
Although they're sent here
as criminal lunatics,
I've often found their crimes
are far less obvious than their sicknesses.
Now this case, for instance...
Herr Muller.
He thinks himself to be God.
He's not the first man
to hold that opinion,
and I don't expect he'll be the last.
And I created man...
in my own image.
Good morning.
How is God today?
God is always in perfect health.
Of course.
And how is Herr Muller?
Herr Muller's arm is still very sore.
Very painful, it is.
Let's see what can be done
to relieve you, shall we?
Awful waste.
No, no, no.
Perhaps I should have warned you
about that nasty little habit.
You'd better let Sarah give it to her.
Well, you certainly know what you're doing.
That corridor houses
my own special patients.
I shall continue to treat them myself.
Special in what way, sir?
In that they interest me.
I see.
Shall I be allowed to see them?
Why not?
Herr Schnieder...
the red disk indicates that
the patient is dangerous.
You would still like to see?
Certainly.
Shouldn't we...?
Don't worry.
He's gone.
Escaped?
He tried to.
He fell 30 feet out
to the stone yard below.
Killed instantly, I suppose?
He ought to have been.
His whole body was just a broken mess.
But he refused to die.
He clung on to life for many days,
although he was in agony.
Fascinating,
I've never seen such strength.
Prodigious.
And his mind?
His mind?
Oh, no, his mind was useless.
No, just sheer animal strength.
That's what kept him going.
The instinct
of self-preservation.
And the strange thing was,
he didn't want to live.
He was a throwback.
He was more animal than human.
Neolithic.
Why was he here?
Homicidal tendencies.
He was fascinated by broken glass.
He liked stabbing people
in the face with it.
Is he buried in the courtyard?
Mm-hmm.
An exhumation might prove valuable.
Let him rest in peace.
Professor Durendel.
He must be a professional.
It's a hobby.
For an amateur, it's brilliant.
No doubt.
Unfortunately, being tone deaf,
I'm unable to appreciate it.
Professor, this is Dr. Helder.
Oh, please don't stop.
You like music?
You like my playing?
Very much.
But I'm afraid I don't recognize
the melody.
Well, of course you don't.
I call it, "The Angel,"
after this one here.
You wrote it?
Mm-hmm.
Professor.
Yes, Dr. Victor?
I am pressed for time.
As usual.
You should rest more.
On the contrary,
it is you who should rest.
You overtax your brain.
I?
Well, just look at all this.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Do you appreciate pure mathematics?
Me?
No, not at all, I'm afraid.
Pity, pity.
More beautiful even than music,
and nearly as beautiful
as my little angel here.
Is there anything you want?
The usual.
Only my freedom.
We'll see what can be done about that.
Swallow these.
Pills.
What for this time?
To help you relax.
I don't want to.
Take them, now.
That's an old trick, Professor.
Open.
Swallow.
Open.
Thank you.
You play beautifully, Professor.
Thank you, thank you.
Pity you don't understand all this.
Pure poetry, I assure you.
Baron.
Dr. Victor, surely that man
shouldn't be in there.
Hmm?
The professor, the man is perfectly sane.
Next time you see the director,
ask him what happened
when the professor attacked him, and why.
That harmless little man?
When roused, that harmless little man
is as savage as a wild cat.
It's doubtful he'll ever leave here alive.
Never?
There must be some way, surely.
There is a way.
Possibly.
Herr Tarmut.
Also dangerous, I see.
He was.
Not anymore.
Herr Tarmut?
Sarah.
See those hands?
Would you have thought it possible
for hands like that
to do this kind of work?
No, quite frankly, I wouldn't.
Less than three months ago,
he was still carving
these exquisite things.
What happened?
His brain atrophied rapidly.
It'll never regenerate.
Angel, wait...
I must leave you now.
Complete these forms...
then make out the prescriptions.
She will help you.
Tomorrow you'll be working on your own.
Sarah, I shall need you
in about half an hour.
Oh, you beastly Twitch.
You beastly Twitch.
See those hands?
Would you have thought it possible
for hands like that
to do this kind of work?
"And there shall be wailing...
and gnashing of teeth."
Don't do that, Sarah.
It's all right, Sarah.
I just want to know what's in there.
So, this is where he sleeps, eh, Sarah?
What do you think you are doing?
Answer me, boy.
What are you doing in here?
I heard cries...
like an animal.
Well?!
It wasn't her fault.
I surprised her.
I'm sorry.
I knew you must have a workshop somewhere.
I knew you couldn't give
up your work completely...
and you haven't,
have you?
No, I haven't given up.
I never shall.
My God.
Well, does that satisfy your curiosity?
Surely this was the Neolithic
man you spoke of yesterday,
the one who tried to escape.
Herr Schneider, yes.
Wasn't he killed jumping from his cell?
He was.
But how did he survive?
What did you do?
He existed for ten days in tremendous pain.
I sedated him...
a massive overdose which would
have killed any normal man...
then I pronounced him dead
and had him buried.
And you dug him up again.
I dug him up again.
And when the sedative wore off?
Before that happened,
I removed a section of the
sensory area of his brain.
That made him unaware of his agony.
Or lessened it, at any rate.
It was a crude effort,
but it was effective.
Just.
The cries, the terrible cries I heard.
Oh, they mean nothing.
Merely that he's hungry.
If he was capable of ripping
the bars from his cell,
why doesn't he do the same to this cage?
It is reinforced
to the necessary specifications.
Even Schneider's strength
couldn't make any impression there.
Those are Herr Tarmut's hands.
Why should you imagine that?
I was awake early.
I saw his burial.
You're very observant.
Incredible.
Quite.
Nevertheless, an accomplished
fact which you are witnessing.
Something I hope you appreciate.
Oh, yes, I do.
Good.
Well... have you
nothing more to say?
The eyes.
There are spiked iron railings
immediately below his window.
He fell on them.
The hands and various
other parts of his anatomy
also suffered, as you can see.
I cleared out what was left of the eyes
and I intend to replace them, eventually.
Incredible.
Is that all you can say?
Have you no constructive
observation to make?
Well...
Yes?
I had heard...
What?
What had you heard?
That you were a brilliant surgeon.
But I'm afraid those post-
operational scars deny this.
I was, and I still am, in here.
But these...
do you see?
They're useless for intricate surgery.
Lost all sensitivity.
How did that happen?
They were burnt...
in the interest of science.
But who operated on him?
Sarah?
Under my instructions.
She did her best.
It was very amateur, I'm afraid.
He'll regrettably disintegrate.
Couldn't I?
I mean, I'm trained.
You told me you were a doctor.
Of surgery.
I'm really a surgeon.
No!
Never use a dirty instrument.
Unless I'm mistaken...
What?
The peripheral artery.
You're not mistaken.
It's what I feared.
The connection has severed.
You must restitch it.
I'll do my best.
You will do it correctly.
Now, come on, now.
You see?
It can be done.
Good morning, Simon.
Do you think that color
would suit our friend?
Hmm...
Excellent.
Excellent.
I couldn't have done better myself.
Pop it in.
Now, in approximately one hour,
when the narcosis wears off, we shall see.
Let's hope it's he who sees.
He who sees?
Sorry.
He who sees.
Oh, I like that.
I didn't think it was
that funny, I must say.
Don't get too near this.
One whiff and you'll sleep for a fortnight.
No, Simon!
He saw me.
He can see.
But he attacked you. Why?
Because he fears me.
Why should he?
I kept him alive when he wished to die.
That is why, Simon.
Sarah, clean gloves and my cloak, please.
Now all he needs is another brain.
Preferably the brain of a genius.
Well, you won't find one here.
Except, of course, the professor's.
But he seems perfectly fit.
He could live for another ten years, more.
He could, indeed.
You wouldn't kill him.
You think I would do that?
No.
But you're so dedicated.
I don't know what to think.
I'm not a murderer, Simon.
All right, Professor, time for your su...
You can't.
You have, haven't you?
It's the professor.
What of him?
He's hanged himself.
With the strings of his violin.
Then the question of the brain
has been settled for us.
We must work fast.
Ready.
Well, go on, make the incision.
What are you waiting for?
Now first...
we lift the frontal lobe,
and you cut the optic nerves.
There are six of them.
Leave the ligaments as long as possible
for the transplant.
Good.
Good.
Now, the left cerebral hemisphere,
and cut the cranial nerves.
There are six of them, too.
Well done.
You're doing well.
Now, the right cerebral hemisphere.
Splendid.
Now, you'll need the scissors.
And we ease up the entire brain,
and you can get through to the spinal cord.
A nice clean cut.
Excellent.
Right.
Excellent.
Excellent...
There's no damage.
No damage at all.
It's a small tube, huh?
We can get rid of that.
Did you leave this
for the professor to see?
That's perfect.
You did an excellent job, Simon.
I congratulate you.
Never mind that.
This form...
the professor's medical record...
did you leave it for him to see?
You've written "incurable,"
and deliberately left it for him to see.
Calm down, boy.
And listen.
Professor Durendel was sent to this place
because of a simple nervous disorder.
Then something happened here,
and he made a homicidal attack
on the director.
But incurable.
I was unable to cure him.
Could you?
Could you have cured him,
or any of the others that you see?
If so, then please tell me how.
I should like to know.
Of course I couldn't.
Then he was incurable.
Yes, but to let him find out like that.
Let us eat.
And then we'll transplant the brain.
That'll take hours.
Have you somewhere to go?
Ah.
Kidneys.
Oh! Delicious.
Optic nerves.
Yes, good.
Right cranial nerves.
You're becoming quite an expert.
Left cranial nerves.
Good.
Severing artery.
Now, sever the spinal cord.
That's got it.
Sarah, use your swab there, please.
Oh.
Now...
to reverse the procedure.
Connect with the spinal cord first.
How long?
Long?
Before we know.
Ten days.
Ten days from now, and we shall know...
for certain.
It will take that long
to get my strength back.
You get some sleep.
You've earned it.
If I can reach my bed
without falling flat on my face.
Simon?
Thank you.
Ten days.
If I've succeeded this time,
then every sacrifice
will have been worthwhile.
Help me.
Professor?
Professor?
Look at me.
Who am I, Professor?
Who am I?
Dr. Victor.
You've done it.
And this young man?
Dr. Helder.
And who is this?
Angel.
The Angel.
What is your name?
Duren... Durendel.
Yes.
You committed suicide, Professor Durendel,
but I saved your brain,
and I've given you a new body.
You've done it.
You've made it work.
You've done it.
We did it...
the three of us.
No, you did.
Baron Frankenstein...
no one else.
No one has ever done this before.
No one in this world.
Now perhaps they'll accept
and understand what I'm trying to achieve?
Of course they will!
Let's drink to that.
Why...
Why?
To Baron Frankenstein,
creator of man.
- Creator?
- What else?
That man in there didn't exist
till you created him.
One man's body, another man's mind.
Creator of man.
We must start exercising
your brain, Professor...
keep it alert.
Now, these problems are far beyond
my command of mathematics,
but no doubt they'll be
child's play to you.
Simon, chalk.
My hands.
You must learn to use them.
Can't... I can't.
You must!
You will learn to use them.
You possess the brain of a genius,
and now the hands of a craftsman.
It's a wonderful combination.
You must practice coordination...
a little every day.
Now...
you try again.
What are you doing?
Why are you writing like that?
What is the matter with you, Professor?
Hungry.
You will eat later.
Now do as I tell you and practice.
Sarah, bring him his food.
Dr. Victor.
Are you feeling unwell, sir?
We've failed, Simon.
How do you mean?
Well, at least I have failed.
The body hasn't accepted the new brain.
It's trying to reject it.
In a few days, it'll succeed...
then the brain will begin to deteriorate,
decay, and finally...
rot to nothing.
The man becomes a cabbage,
and then he'll die.
Another failure.
You can't be sure.
Personally, I don't think
that is what's happening.
It... it could be
the brain just needs more time
to adjust itself.
You must have patience.
Oh, patience.
Yes, patience.
You're badly overtired.
Lie down.
I'll do the rounds, then come back
and keep an eye on him.
No arguments.
Perhaps a little...
Sarah.
Sarah?
Sarah.
I'm sorry.
I'm staying here, Sarah.
You get some rest.
Use my room.
Professor!
Let's get him into the cage.
We were both right, Simon,
and we were both wrong.
I thought his body was rejecting the brain.
It isn't.
It's taking over the brain.
I told you how Schneider
used to kill, remember?
With broken glass.
The sight of that glass
triggered off another step in the reaction.
So we have failed.
Oh, no, we haven't...
and we won't.
There is still a way to succeed.
Even at this stage,
his brain is functioning...
Yes.
...and his body's strong
beyond belief...
every muscle perfectly tuned.
Yes.
If we could just capture
the essence of the man,
now, before it's too late...
The essence?
If everything could be...
reborn, unblemished.
If a new version of his true self
could be created.
How?
In the normal way... by mating.
You can't mean it.
What alternative would you suggest?
But who with?
Sarah.
Sarah?
She is not subnormal,
either physically or mentally.
Her lack of speech is not organic.
It was caused by a traumatic shock...
that's all.
It robbed her of the power to speak.
What shock?
Her father tried to rape her.
You knew about this all along
and did nothing about it?
Another shock could bring it
back at any time,
but now her real function as
a woman could be fulfilled.
Well, what do you say?
I think you're mad.
Possibly.
I must admit, I've never felt so elated
in my life...
not since I first...
Ah, that was a long time ago.
Are you going somewhere?
To Sarah.
Why?
As a doctor, I can appreciate your motives,
but you cannot divorce
science from humanity
to that extent.
I'm taking her to the director
for protection.
- Herr Klauss?
- Yes.
Oh, my dear boy!
He's her father.
Her father?
That is why Professor Durendel
attacked him.
He found out what he had done to Sarah.
It's also why I'm able to do
what I please here...
because I know, too.
Of course, you didn't realize that.
No, I didn't.
It makes a difference, doesn't it?
Yes, it does make a difference.
I'm glad you agree with me.
Well, now...
do you foresee any problems?
The professor...
he wouldn't touch her.
Well, maybe not, under normal conditions,
but with the aid of certain drugs...
I have to go into town.
Don't do anything stupid, will you?
I'm sure you won't.
Professor.
Professor Durendel.
Can you understand me?
Dr. Victor has a plan
involving you and Sarah.
You can't understand
what I'm saying, can you?
Oh, dear God.
Hungry.
What?
Hungry.
All right, I'll feed you.
Let him go.
You spoke.
Simon, get help.
Sarah, you spoke!
Now, Simon, now.
He's angry.
He's angry now.
He wants revenge.
You shall have it,
you shall have it, me beauty.
All the days, a plague shall be in him.
He is defiled.
He is unclean.
He shall dwell alone.
Come on, out.
Get them back!
There's a monster at large!
Well, now, you'll take
a-a little glass
of something, my dear, eh?
Cognac, champagne?
You said you were going
to take me to see...
The lunatics?
And so I shall.
Some of their antics
are very droll, believe me.
But first, I think...
a little drinkie, eh?
- Aren't you frightened?
- Hmm?
I mean, with them all around you.
Oh, not at all, not at all.
What the devil is...?
What in God's name...?
- A monster, sir.
- What?
In the grounds, tearing up the graves.
What?!
God in heaven!
I...
Look, I'm frightened.
My carriage outside...
put her in it.
Send her home.
You and the others, collect arms.
Arm yourselves.
Now go out there
and destroy that thing.
Well, what are you waiting for?!
Key to the armory, sir.
Oh. Yes.
And don't come back until...
until it is destroyed, whatever it is.
We're to get the guns.
Destroy the thing.
Better use them on this lot
before they destroy us.
You...
and Angel.
You...
and Angel.
Fire.
He's going to kill her.
Silence!
Go back to your rooms.
There's nothing more for you to see.
It's all over now.
All over.
Now you can use your hose.
Make this place clean.
Ah, Simon... good.
Lend me a hand, will you?
We've a lot of work ahead of us.
I've been thinking about what went wrong.
Too much reliance on surgery;
Too little on biochemistry.
Now, Reinhauser is very
interesting on that point.
Where are we?
Oh, yes, here we are.
You can read what he says.
The creature's dead, destroyed.
Hmm? Well, that's
of no importance.
Best thing that could have happened to him.
He was of no use to us or to himself.
But... next time...
Next time?
Why, of course.
We'll discuss the details later.
For the moment,
we must get this place tidied up
so that we can start afresh.
Now, we shall need new material, naturally.
Herr Adler in 106, perhaps.
No? Oh, well, no matter.
There's plenty of time to decide that.
Plenty of time.
