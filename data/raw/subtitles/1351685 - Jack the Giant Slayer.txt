Along with her old things.

The monks were trying to find God,
so they made magic...
Magic seeds. Aye.

"With seeds they pulled

"King Erik...

Roderick betrayed you, Father.
He had the crown,

He meant to use the giants

Roderick?
I trusted him with my kingdom.
And worse, I would have trusted him
with you.
Isabelle, I am so sorry.

It's a long ride back to the castle.
Come, let us get you in your armor.

I can reward you with many things.
