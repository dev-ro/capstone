A HIJACKING
- Hello.
- Hi, gorgeous. It's me.
- Baby, you're in Mumbai already?
- No. In another few days.
- I miss you, baby.
- I miss you too.
- How are you?
- Fine. But listen.
- Promise me not to get mad, okay?
- What's up?
I'll be home on the 17th
and not the 15th.
- You can't be serious.
- Yes.
I have to stay a few days in Mumbai
and show the new cook the ropes.
That's not okay.
We agreed that...
Yes, we did, but your husband loves
you more than anything else -
- because you're the most beautiful,
gorgeous and understanding wife.
That's why he loves you so much.
Yeah right.
That's a mean trick to pull.
Is the little princess there?
You don't want to talk
to me any more?
Please put her on.
The captain is here.
- Okay. Take care, baby.
- Sure. Bye.
Kamilla? It's Dad.
- Here she comes.
- Thanks.
- Hi.
- Hi, princess. Can you hear me?
- It's Dad.
- Talk into the phone.
- Sweetie, say something.
- Dad. When are you coming home?
DAY 1
- What are you doing here?
- Checking the water supply.
- We need fresh water in Mumbai.
- No need to shout.
- You want water for your coffee?
- That would be nice.
- Great to see you doing something.
- Are you on your break now?
I am.
- Mikkel?
- Yeah.
- Do me a favour.
- Sure.
Deliver this for me. A letter
for my sister and a gift for my nephew.
- I'd really appreciate it.
- I thought she lived in Greve.
- It is in Greve.
- Solrød Strand?
It's in Greve.
You've been at sea for too long.
And the gift.
It's important.
I'll take good care of it.
- Are you ready to go?
- Hell yeah. I can't wait.
I bet. It's gonna be great
to get home to your girlfriend.
My wife.
Peter speaking.
So, what have they got to say?
Look, if they want to handle our ships,
they have to accept our offer.
Yes, but you need to close this deal.
We have other matters to tend to.
In 2011 and 2012, an export
of 12 million megatonne is expected.
Then there's the sad affair
of the Japanese market.
The tsunami has taken its toll
on their industry.
But we must be present there,
ready for the boom.
Speaking of Japan, Peter...
Japan is a high priority of ours,
isn't it?
Yes. We're negotiating with them
upstairs as we speak.
- Are we closing the deal tonight?
- Absolutely.
- And we'll reach our goal of 10%.
- Great.
- Hi, Jytte.
- Good meeting?
- Excellent, thanks.
- Lars Vestergaard is waiting for you.
He said it was important.
- Aren't you with the Japanese?
- Yes. I just took a quick break.
To give you an update.
Here you go.
I know the contract proposal.
So what's the problem?
I just want to make sure we're in sync
before I put the squeeze on them.
We started out at 21 ,
and we want to come under 15.
- Right.
- How far are we?
- We're at 19.
- 19? 2 million.
- And we want to come under 15.
- Yes, that's right.
- We'll get there.
- Hang on.
Jytte, cancel the rest
of my meetings today.
Hi, Peter.
So, how much did we have to pay?
- 14.5.
- Well done.
- Lars. Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Do you mind? I've got
an interview with the Stock Review -
- and I'd like to change
into a clean shirt.
Thanks.
Lars, could you stay for a minute?
See you upstairs.
Lars, when you need my help,
and you clearly needed it here -
- then get me right away.
Understood?
- Yes. And thank you.
- You're welcome.
Now for the dates. We need seven or
eight days to complete the interview.
I'm at your disposal, but we need
to check with my secretary.
She knows my schedule.
Sorry to interrupt.
Peter, please take a look at this.
Excuse me.
I think we have to call it a day.
Thank you.
They've activated the alarm
on the Rozen.
We're afraid she's been hijacked.
They've lowered their speed.
- They don't answer our calls.
- So we have no contact?
Nothing.
It ends there.
- When did the first call come in?
- An hour and 35 minutes ago.
- Where were they? Where is the ship?
- Look at the screen.
They were bound for Mumbai
and seem to take evasive action here.
- They're far out at sea.
- Yes. India is all the way over here.
- No history of hijackings out there.
- Who's on board?
I'll get right on it.
We need to get hold of an expert
in these matters.
Help me, will you?
I'll be right back.
- Call my wife and say I'll be late.
- Right away.
Play it back.
DAY 3
Honey, you called?
We're about to meet the families now.
I'm glad to hear that.
Thanks.
Modern-day pirates use the Internet,
too. And they read the Danish news.
It's crucial that we keep that in mind.
If they read that we're willing
to do anything to get our men home -
- it will only prolong the agony.
I hope I've made myself clear.
Kaj Sørensen. My wife, Lisbeth.
We are the parents of Jan.
Why don't you pay what the pirates
demand and get our sons home?
We still haven't been contacted
by the pirates.
So we don't know what they demand.
That being said,
we're doing our utmost -
- to get the crew home
as fast as possible.
And that is why we've chosen
to seek professional external help -
- to guide us through the negotiations.
This is Mr. Connor Julian.
Connor has a lot of experience
and specialises in these situations.
Please, ask away.
My name is Maria Hartmann,
and this is my daughter, Kamilla.
I'm married to Mikkel Hartmann,
the ship's cook.
You said you'd had no contact
whatsoever with these pirates.
So how can you be sure
they're okay?
How can you be sure
they aren't already dead?
Right. Excuse me.
Maria...
The honest answer is
we can't be sure.
But we sincerely doubt it.
The ship, the Rozen,
holds no value to us.
The pirates' only bargaining point
is your husband.
Mikkel.
Your sons and brothers are all
they have to bargain with.
So I, personally, Maria,
believe that they're all alive.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Good.
DAY 7
Hi Mikkel.
- How are you?
- We're fine.
The men are healthy,
but the captain has had an ulcer.
Five years ago,
but he had surgery -
- went on medication for a couple of
years and was then pronounced well.
- So he could have an ulcer?
- Sure.
Fuck! Sorry...
We have to piss in this bloody corner.
It stinks.
The captain has shat all
over the place. It's gross.
Oh, for Christ's sake!
I want to use the toilets.
I can't stand living in this stench.
- Did you ask if we could use them?
- Yes.
- We're gonna get ill. Tell them.
- I will...
Shut the fuck up, will you?
We've got to get out of here.
Okay, let's take a break.
See you back here in ten.
We could fly out of Tanzania,
but the Rozen may be too far away.
The pilot may turn back
before he's completed the drop.
- Surely he knows how far it is?
- It's a matter of fuel.
Theoretically, it's possible,
but if the weather conditions...
Oh, the weather, I see.
- So why not Mombasa?
- Theoretically, it's the best place.
But it's illegal to carry
that kind of cash...
- Am I interrupting anything?
- Hi, Anette.
- Did we have an appointment?
- Do I need one?
Not at all.
I was just afraid I'd forgotten it.
- Well, you haven't. Hi.
- Hi. Great to see you.
- Look, I'll come back later.
- Yes.
- But we need to...
- The boss has spoken.
You said that, not I.
Go over potential alternatives
with Connor.
And get hold of the bank. They need
to have the cash standing by.
- I'll call them right away.
- So long.
- You brought shirts. Thanks.
- I thought you might need them.
DAY 25
What are you doing?
Having a piss.
Jesus Christ, Mikkel.
Man, it stinks!
Gross!
Let's try to make friends with him.
Gross!
He's got his finger
on the trigger sometimes.
Bloody hell, he's moody.
- What the fuck?
- He's imitating the picture.
- It's not funny, Mikkel.
- Sure it is.
He wants you to lie down.
- Don't encourage him.
- Sorry.
DAY 39
It's not Omar. It's Mikkel.
Hi, Peter. Look,
how are the negotiations going?
We're making progress.
Slowly, but we'll get there.
I've been talking
to the other partners.
You've been dealing with this
for over two months now.
They don't want it to drag out.
- Well, it won't.
- Okay. My regards to the family.
He hung up, yeah.
DAY 67
Come, Captain.
Let's fish.
Can we fish?
He can have the small one.
There you go.
- Jan, damn it!
- Pull it up!
- Take this! Take it!
- Got it.
Fucking hell, buddy.
You did it.
Come on, man.
- Look!
- Bloody hell, Mikkel!
Come here.
Shut the fuck up.
You don't have a fucking clue.
It's huge.
Plaice!
- Plaice!
- Plaice!
Sing a song for the boys.
Go on, buddy.
Go on.
Today is Kamilla's birthday
hurray hurray hurray
she will get love and presents too
and all her wishes will come true
with chocolate and a lovely piece
of birthday cake
- Hello.
- Maria, it's me. Do you hear me?
- Mikkel?
- Hi.
Hi, baby. Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
- No, we're fine. We're just fine.
- Okay.
- Hi.
- It's great to hear your voice, baby.
- It's great to hear yours too.
- I love you.
I love you too.
- How is Kamilla?
- She's fine, baby.
She loved the bike. Lasse ran
behind her and held her arms.
She rides without
her training wheels now.
She does? Tell her I love her
more than anything else.
I tell her every night.
- Listen... Okay.
- You're such a good father.
- I'm right here, baby.
- If you won't, then I'm gonna do it.
It's okay, baby. Just listen.
Just listen to me.
We have to speak English.
Mikkel, is that you?
- Yes.
- How are you?
Pay them. They're gonna shoot me.
I don't want to die. Please pay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I just talked to Mikkel -
- and he's okay.
Please pay. They're going
to shoot me. I don't want to die.
Good morning.
Did you sleep here?
Let's get some light in here.
Late night yesterday?
I had to go out anyway
and thought I'd stop by.
Are you okay?
How are the negotiations going?
Fine.
Niels Giversen called me yesterday.
He's concerned about you.
So am I actually.
No one can stand
what you're going through.
Why must it be you at that phone
every night? Let someone else help.
I love you.
You know?
I want you to leave.
I want you to leave now!
Get out!
DAY 1 19
Peter, this won't do. Your job is
to handle all company activities.
- That requires focus.
- I have focus.
- How long have you dealt with this?
- Almost four months.
That's too long.
So how long do you think
would be reasonable?
We're giving you
till the end of the month -
- and then someone else
will take over.
- You can't do that.
- Sure we can. And we will.
Take a seat.
Good morning.
Welcome.
It is now 18 weeks since the Rozen
was hijacked in the Indian Ocean.
Our approach so far
has been not to say anything.
But the press is beginning
to write about it.
They're making speculations.
Anonymous sources are even
being quoted... from the company.
I sincerely hope that isn't true.
The situation is very serious.
The crew and their families
are under extreme pressure.
But let me assure you
we're doing our utmost -
- to relieve it.
- What's up?
- We just received this.
- Right now?
- Two minutes ago. Just the fax.
- We got this about 20 minutes ago.
- Any more faxes or phone calls?
- No, that's it.
- Is that all there is? Okay.
It's positive. They've come down from
12 million to 8.5. A substantial drop.
Peter. Another fax.
Hi, Jan.
This is Peter from Denmark.
- Hi, Peter.
- How are you?
Not good.
Jan, the cook, Mikkel,
is he alive?
He's miserable,
but he's breathing. Why?
We're all miserable.
The situation is getting critical
here. I hope you understand.
We do, and we're doing our utmost
to get you home. Please put Omar on.
- Are we going home soon?
- Yes, I promise. Let me talk to Omar.
What's with the stupid smiley?
DAY 127
We're going home, buddy.
I told you so.
I told you we'd make it.
I told you we'd get back home.
DAY 134
Dad?
Daddy?
