- Ten and a half!
- Buy it! Buy!
- Twenty-five. I'll take it!
- How's July? July how?
July's at 95 and a quarter.
At 95 and a quarter.
Ninety-four and a half bid. Ninety-four
and a half bid. Hey, bonehead! Moron!
- Ninety-four and a half...
- Moron? Moron this:
- At 95. At 95.
- Keep your pencil to yourself!
- Ninety-four and three-quarter bid for 300.
- Sold, 300.
Buy 300. Yes!
Three hundred? Three hundred! You idiot!
Get out of my way!
Three hundred lots of coffee futures?
You call that a hunch?
No, Richard, I call that
an opportunity.
Three hundred lots in this market is
not an opportunity. It's a death wish.
- Oh, ye of little faith.
- No, no, no. Me of big mortgage.
- Hi, maddy. Whaddya got?
- American flight 109,
leaving jfk at 1:00 P.M.,
arriving caracas at 6:22 P.M.
- All right, all right.
- Aw, come on. You're not still leaving, are ya?
- After what you just did in there?
- I'm getting married to Charlotte in 30 days.
In order to do that, I need
the divorce from Patricia.
- Toiletries. Two shirts, two shorts, two socks.
- I don't believe this.
You're gonna leave me
with 5,100 tons of coffee?
Richard, the only reason I've
put up with you for so long...
Is 'cause you're
the best analyst on the street.
I... y-you know, you give me
that same patronizing...
Little speech every time you
play one of your stupid hunches.
- Yeah? And what happens?
- I'm hospitalized,
and the blood pressure
medication is adjusted.
Laptop, uplink.
You'll overnight in caracas,
then fly to canaima the next
morning where you'll be met.
Thanks. See ya in two days.
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.
This thing might be quicker
if you used both engines!
Senor cromwell?
Ahh, senor cromwell.
That would be me...
Michael cromwell with a "c."
Senor cromwell with a "c," I am Abe
botero with a "b," your attorney-at-law.
- I am outrageously pleased to meet with you.
- Mm-hmm.
Okay. Abe... Abe, lemme go.
My car is right over here.
Do you have any more luggage?
I travel kinda light, Abe. So
what's the deal? Where is Patricia?
Ahh, we received this letter
from your wife today.
Senora cromwell says that
she could not come to canaima,
but she wants us
to get you to lipo lipo.
Wait a second. What are you talkin' about?
I travel 3,000 to get here,
and she doesn't show up.
What's that about?
Abe has a saying.
He who knows what a woman wants
knows everything,
but not even God knows that.
Okay. If that's the way she wants to
play it, she's not gonna get a dime.
If cromwell should bother to call, put
him through to my office immediately!
Has anybody seen that idiot
kempster around here? Kempster!
Michael, you have got
to get back here tomorrow.
Langston is going insane.
Where are you?
I'm staying in the middle
of "nightmare on bodega street."
If... if you don't get here, do I
sell the coffee or do I hold it?
No, no, no, no. Do not sell the
coffee till I give you the go-ahead.
Call me on the uplink as soon
as London opens, all right?
- All right. Okay.
- Kempster!
No, no. I wouldn't do that.
Oh, and why not?
Lipo lipo.
So nice they named it twice.
Oh, my God.
She left me
for gilligan's island.
Great. I'll be right back.
Not long. I have an appointment.
You have an appointment? Well, if it's
the cable guy, you got plenty of time.
- Okay.
- Hi. Um...
I-I'm... I'm Michael cromwell. I'm
looking for Patricia cromwell.
You know, Patricia. Patricia cromwell?
She's a... uh, she's a doctor.
No. No, a woman,
which would look like me,
but, but, but full-figured.
Paliku.
- Paliku. Paliku. Paliku.
- Pali who?
- Paliku. Pali...
- Pali...
- paliku? Where is she?
- Paliku. Paliku.
- Paliku. Paliku. Paliku.
- Yes, I heard you.
- Paliku.
- Okay, okay.
Patricia.
You look different.
Michael. You made it.
Um, yes, I did.
You look good.
So do you.
- How have you been?
- Better. Much better.
Weren't you supposed to meet me
in canaima last night?
Botako's having
her first litter.
- Congratulations.
- Not her. This is pontspie. Pontspie...
this is botako.
Y-you know, as much as I hate
to spoil this joyous event...
I took an airplane from New York City.
I have a boat waiting.
You remember the divorce?
Patricia.
- Patricia!
- Paliku.
My pinare name is paliku.
We pick our own names here.
Do you remember
12, 13 years ago maybe...
When outta the blue... we weren't even
married a year... and you walked out on me.
And now you want a divorce, and you
think I'm gonna hit you up for money.
We both want a divorce.
And aren't you?
- I don't want any money.
- Great! We can get to caracas right now.
That way we can sign the divorce papers. I'd
be back in New York by, uh, Friday afternoon.
Tomorrow's the fanenteyou celebration.
I have to be here.
- Oh.
- It's a male!
As much as I'd like to stick
around for the circumcision,
I've got a canoe waiting, and
my boatman has an appointment.
- Your boatman is gone.
- What?
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait! Tell him to stop!
Hasta LA vista.
Hey, hey, hey! Stop!
You can't leave me here!
What you're doing
is very unprofessional.
Oh, no. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come back here!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I'm gonna need all these clothes back
right where they came from, all right?
Aww, this is a braun.
Wh... what about my boat?
He'll be back, couple of days.
- What am I supposed to do now?
- The chief says you can spend the night with the bachelors.
- I'm not stayin' with the bachelors.
- Or pontspie offered her hut.
Bring on the bachelors.
Aw, come on. Come on.
- Hungry?
- I am starving.
- Oh.
- It's yellow-eared bat, a pinare specialty.
- It's made from the bladder.
- Oh, bat bladder.
Holy kaopectate.
I don't think so.
- You might prefer the Kara toka.
- Yeah, right.
- Chicken.
- Yeah, I would prefer that.
Thanks. Okay. Okay.
I'm ready. Excuse me.
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Michael.
Michael, there's something that
I have to talk to you about.
- Patricia, let's not, okay?
- Well, there's something that you don't know.
Oh, yeah? Like why you left me.
I left you because
of the fifth phone line.
- What is that supposed to mean?
- One morning some guy...
Showed up at our apartment
to install a fifth phone line.
He asked if I was
the receptionist.
And I realized
that I had lost you somehow.
So I packed my things, and I left you
alone. I figured you'd be happier that way.
- You thought this would make me happy?
- How long before you noticed I was gone?
Why didn't you talk to me? -Talk to you? I
spent six months telling you I was unhappy.
It was a crazy time for me. I'd
just started working at l.T.G.
- I had a straddled position in sugar. The price went up.
- Michael.
- It skyrocketed. I'm short in...
- Michael. Michael!
- What?
- It's very hard for me to tell you this, so please listen.
Well, what choice do I have? I'm stuck
here with you and the village people...
Till you celebrate
banana-fana fo-fana.
Hello, you.
Excuse me. The real world calls.
Hello, you.
- What I'm trying to say is that...
- Look, I was right.
- I wasn't exactly alone when I left.
- I was right. I was right.
- Ninety-seven and a quarter?
- Michael.
- I guess... I'm... I'm with ya. Coffee has gone crazy.
- Michael.
- I didn't know it at the time, but I was...
- 97 and a quarter. 97... 97 and a quarter.
Am I greedy? I'm feelin' pretty greedy. I'm s...
I'm gonna wait till... -...Pregnant with your son.
97 and a half,
'cause it's gonna happen.
Waitin'. Papa is waitin'.
Come to papa. Come to papa.
Ninety-seven and a half. Ninety-seven and
a half. Sold for a tidy $300,000 profit.
God, it's good to be good.
- What'd she say?
- Hello, you.
Patricia.
All right, Patricia,
what'd I do?
I just told you that you had a
son, and you didn't even hear me.
What are you talking about,
I have a son? What son?
Your son. The boy sitting next to
the fire over there is your son.
That is my son?
I must've started
a thousand letters to tell you,
but every one of them started with,
"I know you never wanted children."
- This is nuts. This is nuts. This is unbelievable.
- I was confused.
- Do you know what you just said to me? This is unforgivable!
- I didn't know what to do.
I'm not asking you to forgive me, but he
didn't do anything, so don't blame him.
That's my son?
His name is Mimi siku.
His name is what?
Mimi siku.
Mimi siku.
Roughly translated it means...
Cat piss.
- He picked the name cat piss?
- He was six years old at the time.
It's a territorial thing.
- You sure he's mine?
- Positive.
He's got your nose,
and he thinks he's never wrong.
Hello, you.
No, no. Go. Get away.
No, no, no. Don't touch that!
Don't touch that. No.
Don't touch that.
Ohh.
You wouldn't happen to have a place
where I could stick that, would ya?
Hello, you.
Talk about
your wind instruments.
Oh, ease up on the fruit,
for God sakes.
Mitsubishi!
Mimi siku.
Hi, uh, Mimi siku.
I'm Michael cromwell.
Patricia... oh, um... paliku...
tells me that, um,
that I-I'm... I'm your father.
That's a nice pot you have.
Do you understand any English?
Well, Patricia... or paliku... wanted
me to say somethin' paternal to ya.
And I gotta admit,
th-this isn't easy for me.
I don't have any regrets.
Well, I have regrets.
But then again... too
few to mention hah!
Michael.
- You all right?
- Yes.
You should put air bags
in these things.
What do you call this place
again? The surface of the sun?
Mimi said that you talked
to him last night.
I told him that I was
his father, and, uh,
he said somethin' in Indian
and then gave a girl a pot.
Giving a pot here is like giving flowers.
It's a love gift.
He's very popular
with the girls.
Maybe he is mine after all.
He is yours.
Why don't you try again? He's going
out on the river. Go with him.
Maybe I can teach him
about commodities.
Based on what I learned here
in the bachelor hut last night,
he could make a killing
in gas futures.
- Go.
- Is it the local fruit?
- Baboon! Baboon!
- Huh?
No, no, no, no.
Uh, uh, a monkey.
Monkey.
Parasite.
No, uh, Mimi. Um... water. Wa...
piranha.
Cut. Infection. Death.
Oh.
Hoko: Bird.
Bird who can't sing: Hoko ono.
No, no, no, no, no.
Hoko is toucan.
"Bird" is pomoko.
- You speak English?
- Paliku taught me.
So, you understood
everything I said last night.
Is it much further? You know,
these shoes cost me $500. Whoa.
Hey, hey, hey!
Good shot.
Buradu.
Okay.
- Scared of snake?
- No. Scared of snake bite.
- This buradu is dead, right?
- Sleeping. We kill it before we eat it.
No, no, no, no, no.
I do not eat snake.
- Lizard guts.
- You know, actually the snake filled me right up.
No, no, no, no, no.
I make it for you. Taste good.
Now you here you stay with me
all the time?
I'd like to, Mimi siku,
but I can't.
Why?
Well, I have a whole
'nother life where I live.
- Another son?
- No. You're the only son I have.
- I'll teach you to hunt.
- Tomorrow, I've gotta go back to my village.
I'm a trader.
That's what I do, okay?
Thi... this in
your village, yes?
Woman who hold fire
up sky's butt?
I've never... I've never had her
described quite like that.
Yeah, she's in my village. We
call her the statue of liberty.
When I'm a man, will you take me
to statue of liberty?
Sure. Why not? Yeah. When you're a man,
I'll take you to the statue of liberty.
Sleep time.
Mimi, don't move!
Don't move!
There's a giant spider on ya!
Don't move! What's it doin'?
Oh, great!
It's now comin' up to me!
Damn, it's chasin' me!
Wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
I don't want to hurt you,
but I will.
I will crush you like a bug.
Mimi, don't! No, no! I can handle this.
Go to the village. Save yourself.
No, no! Back! Jesus!
If you scream, maitika attack.
If you're calm, maitika nice.
But kukuve always mean.
Who's kukuve?
This place is a nightmare!
Nice turtle.
The hair on your chest
reminds them of a monkey.
"Baboon" is your pinare name.
Baboon? That's the best
they can come up with?
Well, at first they wanted to go with
"man who must be smarter than he looks."
If we get to pick our own names,
I'd like to pick this:
Man who's extremely
well-endowed.
Sorry, it's already taken.
- What's he sayin' to 'em?
- The chief is telling the forest...
That Mimi's no longer a child.
- Are they finished?
- Almost.
But to become
a tribal leader someday,
Mimi has to perform a special task
that the chief will give to him.
He says he's very proud of Mimi siku,
and as his father, you should be too.
Well, I am very proud of him
considering the fact...
That I just found out
a couple days ago I had a son,
and I'm standing about
four feet from a witch doctor.
The chief has given
Mimi the task...
Of bringing fire back
from the statue of liberty.
- Guy doesn't kid around, does he?
- You promised...
To take me to New York
when I become a man, baboon.
When... when you're a man,
I will.
In this tribe, he is a man,
and he wants to go now?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Tomorrow
we fly to caracas, we sign the divorce papers,
then I get in the big steel bird
and fly back to New York City.
Did you promise to take him
to New York or not?
Maybe. Mimi siku, I have to be
back at the exchange floor.
I'm gettin' married.
I cannot take you tomorrow.
Here, if you make a promise,
you keep it.
"Tomorrow." "Can't." "Maybe." These
words don't mean anything to Mimi.
- He doesn't understand them.
- It's not my fault he doesn't understand.
You're his mom. You brought him down here
to live with the pirates of the Caribbean.
- Maybe you shoulda taught him better English.
- This is...
The most important day
in your son's life,
and he wanted you here
to share it with him.
And now you're gonna humiliate him
in front of the whole tribe...
By not keeping the first promise
you ever made to him?
Baboon, I... I want to go.
Mimi siku, I am...
I'm very sorry.
You made wakatepe with me.
Excuse me, Mr. cromwell,
but the young man you're with
is urinating on the exit door.
Thank you.
Me happy to be with you, baboon.
Michael! Michael!
All right, we gotta get
movin' here pretty... come on.
Get on there. It's just...
it's a moving sidewalk.
Michael! Hey, Mike!
- Michael. How ya doin'?
- Richard, what are you doin' here?
I told Langston you had a reason.
You do have a reason, right?
- For what?
- For holding onto the beans.
- What beans?
- The coffee beans.
- You didn't sell them?
- No.
I told you to sell them
at 97 and a half.
Oh, God! I'm dead!
I'm gonna lose my house!
Where will my children live?
Richard. Richard. Excuse me.
Richard, Richard, Richard.
Come on. Why didn't ya sell?
'Cause you didn't confirm,
that's why!
- What?
- You did not confirm.
- What's coffee doin' now?
- It's under 90 cents...
And gone limit down!
I asked you, I told you
to sell it at 97 and a half,
and you can't do it
'cause I didn't say "confirm"?
- You're an idiot.
- Look, for 15 years, Michael,
you say "sell," I say "confirm."
"Sell." "Confirm."
"Sell." "Confirm."
You confirm, and I sell. You
didn't confirm, so I didn't sell.
Look, kid, I've given
to the rain forest, okay?
His name is Mimi siku.
- He's my son.
- What do you mean "son"?
Uh... y-you didn't have one when
you left here three days ago.
Well, apparently I did.
He's Patricia's son.
He's Patricia and my son.
- This your village, baboon?
- Yep. This is my village.
It's big.
Where are all the animals?
Up in their offices,
where they work.
Cromwell!
Okay, take a look at that.
Baboon must go fight the chief.
Look at this!
Cromwell, look at this.
Coffee is at 88,
and it's dropping like a brick.
By tomorrow morning,
it could be 85 or lower.
If we just wait it out, something'll
happen. The market will turn around.
- But what if it doesn't?
- You remember what happened in '91?
You can't always depend
on a natural disaster.
It doesn't have to be a natural disaster.
We can hope for an assassination.
- Oh, would you take it seriously for once?
- In just a minute.
- I'm tryin' to lighten this guy up.
- Stop it! Stop it! Now come on.
Behave yourselves here! Now
something better happen fast...
Or I'm gonna throw
both your butts out the window.
What the hell do you hotshots think
about when you make these deals?
You seem to have forgotten, cromwell, that
you were investing the company's money!
When you invest the company's money
and win, the company's behind you.
But when you screw up like this, you're
both on the hook for any loss we take.
- It would be over a million dollars.
- Now that's not my problem.
And by the way, cromwell,
when somebody is playing with
millions of dollars of my money,
I generally like them
in the country.
- This country!
- Sto... stop yelling, please.
This is still my office.
I'll shout, I'll yell,
I'll scream as much as I want.
When I made you shareholders in this company,
it was to share profits, not losses!
Not losses is right. We're not
here to share, share losses.
We're here to share profits!
Profits! Profits!
Look up! It's a... an alien circle
with Mickey Rourke's picture in it.
Look at it!
Look, look, look, look, look!
Up! Up! Look! Look up! Look up!
He... he just found out
that he has a son.
- Look, look, look, look, look!
- Stop shouting, baboon.
- Maitika kill chief.
- Catch the damn spider, will ya, please?
Go, go, go.
I-I... I said I was gonna go fight
the chief, not kill the chief.
Around here, only
postal employees kill chief.
Do you understand?
Boy, whatever you do in Venezuela,
do not try the chili del fuego.
And I say
we should just wait it out.
You're insane. Langston
is right. You know, we, we, we,
we have to find a buyer for the coffee,
cut our losses and get out now.
Wow. Nice shot.
Put this away!
Would you give me a few moments with
Charlotte before you bring Mimi up, okay?
All right.
- Michael, you're back!
- Boys. Brian. Brian.
Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Come, come, come!
Oh, I missed you.
You never called me.
- Well, I had...
- I was so worried.
Uh, we're here,
but we're not "here," okay?
Try to think of us
as, uh, furniture.
Just act natural.
So did you miss me, darling?
I missed you very much.
My pieces in the show
were such a hit that Ian...
- Michael cromwell, this is Ian Finch-chumley.
- Good to meet you, Ian.
- Hi, Michael.
- He's gonna be doing a profile on me for the fashion channel.
He'll be following me from now
through the spring collection,
and he'll be covering
the wedding as well.
Isn't that fabulous?
There's... there's a...
there's a fashion channel?
- Yeah.
- Forget the camera.
Just talk to me.
They're furniture.
Now, honey, did you
get everything settled?
- Yeah.
- Yes! Oh!
Actually... um, actually,
Patricia was, was
very reasonable.
So?
What did you bring me?
- Ow!
- So, Mimi, how old are you?
The roots of the yomano tree...
Have broken ground
three times in my life.
So I guess that would
make you around...
- thirteen.
- Thirteen. Thirteen.
You know, I have a daughter
around that age... Karen.
Will I meet daughter?
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no, she's
just up at Charlotte's house.
She's trying on her dress
for the wedding.
- What are you doing?
- Feed maitika.
What's maitika?
- Are you upset?
- You brought back a child.
Everyone else I know comes back from
South America with a bag of coffee.
Well, I have ten million bags of coffee. I thought I'd
bring you back somethin' with a little less caffeine.
I have a show to prepare
and a wedding to plan.
What the...
but that's months away.
Honey!
He's only gonna be here
for a short while.
- Mimi.
- Baboon.
- What have you done with Mr. kempster?
- Excuse me. Michael.
- Do you know who maitika is?
- Daddy.
Karen.
Look at you. You look beautiful.
Angel on table.
- Look at me. I'm smoking.
- The rain forest is a very hot issue right now.
Being associated with this, uh,
jungle bloke... it can only help you.
Where is the rain forest?
Brian, find out where
the rain forest is.
Right.
- Oh. Ah.
- Mimi siku, this is Charlotte.
And, uh, Charlotte,
this is Mimi siku.
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mimi siki.
- Mimi siku.
- Mimi siku.
- This your female, baboon?
- This is my female.
And as his female, I'd like to
invite you to dinner tonight...
With Fiona gluckman.
She's the fashion editor
of Elle magazine. Very major.
She wants to see the sketches
for my wedding trousseau.
And if you're available,
I'd love for you to join us.
Is there anything special
you like to eat?
Lizard guts.
- Lizard guts?
- Yes, but very lean.
- Great earrings. Honey!
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Mimi. Mimi. Mimi.
Do you remember what we talked about
using the toilet on the airplane?
Let's continue to do that. Um, I
will find the men's room for him,
and we will see you tonight.
Come on, Mimi.
Will he be wearing
the loin cloth to dinner?
I'll get him some clothes.
No, no, no. Don't...
don't touch it. Don't touch.
Before you pee you lift the seat. After
you pee you put the seat back down.
Females in tribes
start war over this.
Many deaths.
Oh, that's very good. Very...
Bob Montgomery.
That's wonderful.
Listen. So, Bob, I'm standing
with Michael cromwell,
and, and, and you know, considering
our long history together,
you're the first person
we wanted to make this offer to.
Are you ready?
5,100 tons of coffee beans.
- We're dead. Okay?
- Baboon!
- Baboon!
- He's doing a fay wray!
- Michael! Mumu!
- Mimi!
- Come back inside!
- Statue of liberty, baboon!
- You do as I tell you!
- Get this!
- Come look!
- No, no, no. Come back here!
- Mimi, wait. Get... get back in here. Come on.
- Cool!
- Life happens around you.
- Come on. Move! Get outta my way. Come on.
Mimi! Watch out,
watch out, watch out.
- Mimi! Mimi!
- Get the wide angle lens for this.
Stay outta the way, please.
Mimi! Wait, wait, wait!
Statue of liberty, baboon.
- Statue not far, baboon.
- Mimi. You stand right there.
- We go now?
- We'll go tomorrow, okay?
Whoa.
People down there
so far from us.
I'd like to keep 'em
that way, okay?
- I'm gonna die up here. I'm gonna die up here.
- Nothing bad happen, baboon.
I just hate heights. I...
whoa. Oh.
Pinare secret: Don't look down.
Just for the record,
it's not that big a secret.
Yes!
Don't you ever, ever, ever
do that to me again!
When I tell you to do somethin',
I mean it. D'you understand me?
Mimi siku sorry.
Look. Look, look,
look, look. I-I'm...
Sorry.
I... I was just worried about you
out there. I really was.
All right? W... um...
we should go.
- Baboon scared?
- Yes, baboon scared.
Baboon not know
he could be so scared.
Baboon's pants a little damp.
Oh, my God. Oh, Charlie!
- Mimi, get down.
- This is fabulous!
When I saw the shoulders
on this gown, I plotzed.
I said to myself, "Fiona, this,
this is the future of fashion."
O-oh, no.
Remember what I told ya?
Forks go on the left side... this side.
Small fork on the outside.
Take your knife,
put it over next to the spoon.
Blade... blade in. Perfect.
Yeah. You might wanna
work on that one too.
In lipo lipo we eat with hands. -In
New York, New York, we eat with forks.
When are we gonna eat?
I'm famished.
A little champagne?
You know, why don't we show her
the bride's maids sketches?
Show me, show me,
show me, show me.
Oh, I'm loving this!
What is taking so long
with the food?
I'll give them a call.
I don't eat meat.
I don't eat dairy...
Or nightshade vegetables,
and of course
I don't touch preservatives.
Obviously.
- Cat fat.
- Mm-hmm.
- We eat cat.
- Excuse me?
- That must be the food.
- Oh! Finally.
- Gino. Louis.
- Coming.
We are not going to eat the cat.
Cat's job: Feed people.
No, not here. Here, cat's job
is to sleep and lick crotch.
Oh! Charlotte, it smells so good! I
can't stand it. I can't stand it.
Course, this is
much too much for me.
Did they forget my tiramisu?
- Oh, God.
- This much tasty.
Your female
makes good food, baboon.
Oh, Louis,
you are such a cliche.
You had no right
to change the rules.
- What rules?
- When we talked about having children,
we agreed that you would be my child
and that I would be your child.
And now I find out that
you've had a child all along.
Wait a second! Are you saying
I knew that I had a child?
Well, if I had a child,
I certainly would've known.
Hello? You're a woman.
Of course you'd know.
You're there when you have it.
Look, there's no magical bond between a
father and son that spans the continents.
The only reason I know I have a
child is because you insisted...
- Oh, so now you're saying that you having a child is my fault.
- I go down the Amazon to finalize the divorce.
- I don't think so, Michael.
- Mimi's just visiting.
I wanna show him a good time.
After that, he goes back home,
and we can go back to being
exactly the way we were:
Entirely wrapped up
in ourselves.
Promise?
Ow!
My little darlings.
Ahh! Ooh!
Are your little bellies empty?
Aww.
Bonjour.
Bonjour-r-r.
We are all so happy today,
n'est-ce pas?
What's goin' on up here?
You... go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!
Mimi, you can't do this. We do not
kill birds around here for breakfast.
If you're hungry, ask me.
I bought some stuff for ya.
This is what kids love:
Cap'n crunch.
- What is?
- This is cereal.
It's just corn, brown sugar,
yellow number five and zinc oxide.
They've added a sunblock to it.
You pour this on this.
That's your breakfast.
Enjoy yourself.
Charlie.
Come on. Wake up, sweetheart.
Wake up. Charlie,
bloomingdale's burned down.
- What?
- Mimi's havin' breakfast out in the kitchen.
I will be home before lunch.
- Bye.
- Bye. Wait!
I can't watch him.
Women's wear is coming
to the loft.
You don't need to baby-sit him.
He'll be fine.
Now go back to sleep.
Mimi, I gotta get goin' here.
No, no!
This is... n... no,
it's not, not, not your fault.
I-I didn't... I didn't mention that
you usually put this in a bowl.
Wh-when we go
to statue of liberty?
- Uh, tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
I know I told you we were
goin' today, but I can't today.
I've... I've... baboon's makin'
some very big trades today.
- Me go trade with baboon.
- Baboon go alone.
I'd like to be around you,
but, but...
I'm obligated to go.
- What means "obligated"?
- Obligated. I-it means...
When you do somethin' that
you don't really wanna do.
Okay.
- Baboon obligated.
- And, uh, will you promise baboon one thing?
You won't shoot
any more animals?
And don't eat the cat.
I'll bring food home.
Maitika.
Maitika? Maitika?
Maitika?
Maitika?
Maitika.
Maitika.
Maitika.
Maitika.
- Nice pushibushi.
- That is the last pushibushi...
You're gonna see around here,
you little savage!
Hi, we're not here right now. Leave a
message. We'll call you right back.
Charlie, pick up. It's me.
You're probably in the bathroom
makin' yourself look beautiful.
Um, I don't want you
feelin' trapped by Mimi.
Try to open up to him. Just don't
leave him alone with the cat.
I'll see ya soon.
I love you. Bye.
Michael, don't hang up!
Don't hang up! There's a spider!
This can't be happening!
This is a penthouse apartment!
There's nothing to gain
when there's nothing to be lost
there's nothing to gain if you
stay behind and count the cost
make a decision you can be
who you can be, can be
tasting the fruit
come to the liberty tree
someday
- help a guy out. Spare change for food.
-  Someday

in what you say

-  When you're on your way today
your day it's your day
- right there. - That way?
- Yeah, right, right there.
Thank you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- We're gonna break it down
let 'em out, let 'em out
let 'em out, let 'em out
we have to shake it down
shake it all around
you know, it's gotta
be 15 years...
Since I really stopped
and looked at that statue.
Yes. Uh-huh.
11:00? We'll be there. Okay.
What? Oh. He hung up.
I found us a buyer.
Changing faces
in the strangest places
tastin' the fruits of our roots
this is just a deja vu
or tell me is it really true
hit me like a puzzle
I ain't got a clue
is this really my imagination
that I'm confronted with
these altercations, yeah
gotta shake the tree
gotta shake the tree
- honey, go get help!
-  Leave it up to me
we are shakin' the tree
we are shakin' the tree
I should take
some pictures of Mimi.
You can never have enough
pictures of your kids.
We have, like, 400 albums.
I've never looked at them, but
they exist. It's good, you know?
Come on. Let's get going.
Michael, you have a call.
- I told you to hold all calls.
- Richard.
- It's the police.
- What?
And on top of everything else, didn't I
tell you to wait in the apartment...
- I want to see statue of liberty.
- I said we'd do that tomorrow.
Always tomorrow. You
too busy for Mimi siku!
I want to see
statue of liberty, I go.
Look, Mimi,
I've got a life here.
I can't change everything
just because you showed up.
- Then why you bring me here?
- I was obligated.
You obligated be with me?
Mimi. Mimi? Mimi!
Mimi, come here! Stop!
Come back here!
- Mimi! I didn't mean that!
- You said "obligated"!
I didn't mean that.
Now, stop! Look out, Mimi!
Come back!
Get out of the street!
Come on! Get out of the street!
I want to go home!
You not want Mimi siku here!
I want you here. I'm sorry.
Look, stop, stop. Look.
- Sorry I said that stuff. I was just angry, all right?
- You always angry at me!
- "Don't do this. Don't do that."
- This is New York.
- This is a dangerous jungle.
- Mimi siku not scared. Mimi siku a man.
No, you're not a man.
You are an adolescent.
- Adolescent?
- Yes, an adolescent.
You don't have a wife.
You don't have
a family to support.
You are free to do
whatever you want.
You're an adolescent.
What? No, no, no, no, no! I am
not an adolescent. I'm a man.
- I'm a man too.
- Not here you're not a man.
You're a 13-year-old boy
running around in a loincloth.
I'm a man too!
Okay, okay. You're right.
You are a man.
But you're gonna have to learn
what men do in my jungle.
And you have to learn
how to breathe when you run.
Okay, first lesson. Ooh!
You wanna go someplace
in my village,
all you gotta do
is wave your arm.
Wave your arm.
- Magic.
- No, magic will be if he understands English.
All right, fulton fish market
on "ze" double.
Okay.
Wh-where is he? Richard, this guy
gets very upset when you're late.
Yes, well, he's gonna be here.
He-he's obviously delayed...
here he is! Okay.
- All right. Get your stuff. Get out on the other side.
- Thank you very much.
- You call this a tip?
- Watch it. Mimi, watch traffic when you're comin' around.
- What took you...
- We're meeting this guy at a fish stall?
No, no, he is
above a fish stall.
Much better.
Oh, I love what they've
done with the place.
Now, look. Let me tell you something.
This guy has a lot of money, okay?
He's the king of caviar,
and he's gonna save our asses.
So you just play your hunches
and let me play mine.
Okay, okay. Now listen up.
When you get to the top of
the stairs, ring the bell once,
knock twice,
then ring three times.
- Okay.
- Don't forget.
- What happened to his fingers?
- He rang four times.
Good luck.
Ring twice, knock once,
ring three times. Okay.
- Oh, boy.
- Okay, um, okay.
- So, it is...
- What? What?
- Ring twice.
- Ring twice. Got it. Got it. Got it.
Knock once, and then
you ring three times.
- You sure it's three?
- Yes, it's definitely three times.
Okay.
Okay, that's wrong. So what
we do... ring three times.
- I'm not sure it...
- Knock once and ring twice.
- No, it would be...
- Yeah, yeah.
- We're gonna get shot.
- Mm-mm. No, it's gonna be fine. It's gonna be good.
- Yeah, okay, that really worked out great.
- Seriously.
- I remember differently now. I got what it is.
- All right, Mr. wizard. Take over, please.
- Ring twice.
- Take over.
- You knock once.
- And ring tw...
no, you do not, whatever you do,
ring four times.
Open damn door!
- Hi, there. I am, uh...
- Hi.
Don't say a word.
I know, I know.
Let me introduce
my comrades to you.
Stand up. Thank you. Sit down.
Come. We talk beans.
Sit, sit, sit.
Coffee on market
now 83 cents one pound.
I pay you 85 cents one pound.
- Why you take trade?
- Shhh.
- Uh, Michael.
- 85 cents more than 83 cents?
- Yes, it is.
- Tell wild child to shut up!
- Hey!
- You know, he's just a kid.
I mean, hey, listen.
He's... he's an unusual kid.
Not now, mama.
So moving on.
So we have a deal then?
I want guarantee the price
not drop below 75.
- You got it.
- Wait a minute!
There are no guarantees.
This is a speculation.
I know speculation.
He knows speculation, for heaven's sakes.
So, so when can we expect payment?
Oh, this is lovely.
Look, Richard, it's cash.
- Oh, my.
- Take!
Look, um, would it be possible to
talk to my partner in private?
- Of course.
- Richard, let's go.
It'll just take a moment.
Richard, are you
out of your mind?
Now we're laundering money
for the Russian mafia?
Yes, we are. And we'll
iron it for them too.
- Him big buradu.
- Yes, he is.
- Come on, Mimi. Let's go.
- Aw, come on, Michael.
- We cannot... you cannot walk away on this. Please!
- That's it. No deal.
- Just think about this for one second.
- Just get us out of this.
- All right.
- Problem?
Oh, no. No, no, not at all.
Uh, Mr. cromwell
had to take his son home.
But he thinks you're
a stand-up guy, Mr. j.
- He feels that...
- My name is...
Alex vasili Sergei
fyodor jovanovic.
Not Mr. j.
It's a good name.
We have deal?
"We have deal?"
We have deal?
- Here you go.
- Thanks, buddy.
Now this is America, huh?
- Hot dogs here!
- Tastes like lizard guts.
Oh, really?
Tell them good-bye
many tribes
in your village, baboon.
Yeah, I guess there are.
- Music.
- Uh-huh.
- What? What?
-  So let's go downtown
and turn it around
- now, baby.
- Baby
- it's my life.
- It's my life.
I'll do what I want -
Do what I want - oh, yeah
it's my life - I'll think
what I want - think what I want
maybe I'm wrong - Maybe I'm
wrong - show me some time
maybe I'm right - One day I'll do
it right - come on, baboon! We dance!
- I don't dance in public.
- It's my life - it's my life.
-  I'll do what I want
- Come. I'll show you.
- It's my life.
- It's my life.
- I'll think what I want.
- Think what I want
- it's my life.
- It's my life.
- I'll do what I want.
- Do what I want
- it's my life.
- It's my life.
I'll think what I want -
It's my life - it's my life
- oh, yeah.
-  I'll do what I want

- It's my life
give me what I want.
I'll do what I want, baby

it's my life
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
it's my life
it's my life
I can do what I want
- it's my life.
- It's only my life
it's my life
it's my life
I can do what I want, yeah
pretty cool. I haven't danced like
that since I was a little kid.
Oh, you'll get used
to those shoes.
Huh? Here. Why don't you
give her the flowers, huh?
Charlie,
how'd that interview go?
- You home, Charlie?
- Michael, I'm in here!
- Charlie?
- Michael, I've been in this bathroom for hours!
- Make sure you open a window.
- Michael!
I'm being attacked
by a giant spider!
Oh! Uh, uh, I-I-I can see it.
Move away from the door! Quickly,
move away from the door!
- Grab this thing. Come on, come on, come on.
- Do something!
Oh, I'm doing something. I'm gonna
fight it. Stay away from the door!
Look at that. Look at that. Oh,
it's a big one! It's a big one!
- Be careful!
- I'm gonna put it in the wastebasket.
Don't come out here yet.
It's still moving.
- Put the thing back in his box.
- What?
It's as big as an ox!
You bad girl, maitika.
Stay here.
To him it's like a pet.
No, no, no, no. A dog is a pet,
Michael. A cat is a pet.
Although for your son, a cat
is a dietary supplement as well.
We'll just keep him out
on the balcony.
How do you know it hasn't already
laid eggs in the apartment?
- I'll have the place fumigated.
- Well, what if they miss one...
And it grows up and crawls
into my ear one night...
While I'm sleeping and
lays its eggs in my brain?
We'll have to have them
come back and spray again.
This is serious, Michael!
We have to move!
You're blowing this
way out of proportion.
Oh!
Ian. Great.
I've really missed you.
Is Charlotte all right? Look,
if something dramatic has
happened, it should be on film.
I have a shoot tomorrow which
I was unable to prepare for...
Because I was trapped
in the bathroom all day...
By his son's pet spider.
So I'll be spending the night at
the loft to make up for lost time.
So, the appearance of little mowgli
is straining the relationship?
Ian, you're furniture,
and furniture doesn't talk.
Furniture may not talk, Michael, but
it listens, better than you do.
I'm an artist, Michael. You look
at something and see what it is.
I look at something
and see what it can be...
And who can wear it.
Charlotte. Y...
you all right?
Charlotte's mad.
She doesn't like me.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on.
It's not you at all. It's me.
She's afraid of change.
Why did paliku
leave you, baboon?
Boy, um...
I probably took her for granted.
So, n-now you're with Charlotte.
Yes, I am.
Many females
in your village, baboon.
- Mm-hmm.
- Why you pick only one?
Well, when you pick one to love,
it's very different.
It's like there's a big picture of her
in front of your face at all times.
And the picture's so big
you can't see any other females.
Well, I try harder
to make Charlotte like me.
- Hi.
- Hello, jan. You look nice today.
Thank you.
This is Mimi siku.
Mimi, this is Mrs. kempster,
and I think you know Karen.
- Isn't he adorable?
- Mom!
- Hello, Mimi siku!
- Jan.
I am so happy that
you've come to our house...
- Jan.
- In the country to spend the night!
- Jan, he's not deaf.
- Although he might be now.
I can't thank you enough
for lettin' him spend the night.
I've really got to spend
some time with Charlotte.
It's our pleasure.
All right, everything he needs is in the
knapsack here. He sleeps in a hammock.
It's in there, and he'll set it
up somewhere around the yard.
- Okay!
- Is Richard home?
He left early for the office.
Over in the comex,
coffee continues to plunge...
From its high of 971/2
less than a week ago.
In trading today, the price
of futures was at 68.5.
The blue chip indicator
rose slightly...
in other news, reactions were...
what kind of a dumb name
is Mimi siku?
Don't be rude. He probably
thinks Andrew is a dumb name.
So do I.
- I think Mimi siku is a nice name.
- You would.
These are my father's fish.
That's a poe... poe... uh...
it's a poecilia latipinna.
They're from the Amazon.
- We call it rishi.
- Rishi?
- Yeah.
- Oh. I like that name better.
At least I can pronounce it.
Oh! Hi. Do you like fish, Mimi?
I'm cooking fish for lunch.
- We call it rishi.
- Fish.
Oh!
This not fish. Not taste good.
Well, it's frozen, Mimi.
You have to cook it first.
Oh! Poor thing.
'Kay now, be honest. Which do you like
best for the flower girl's dress?
- Yeah?
- Michael, it's me!
Richard, not now. Charlotte
and I are just about to...
look toward the kitchen.
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.
Great. Okay. All right,
Richard. Thanks. Bye.
Excuse me just
for a second, please.
- What? What? What?
- I made the deal.
- What deal?
- Uh, with jovanovic.
After you left, I made the deal.
- Are you out of your mind?
- Yes, yes.
I am, I am
out of my mind. Squid?
No, no, no, no, no. H-how did you get the
certificates out of the vault without my signature?
- Well...
- You forged my signature?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was... I was
afraid that we would lose everything.
- What did you do with the money?
- It's here. Here.
You're walking around New York City
with a million dollars in a suitcase?
Not so loud!
Would you... it's good.
Hi. The worst part...
- there's a worse part?
- Oh, yes, there is.
Coffee fell below 75
this morning.
- Let me think. Let me think.
- Yes.
Come on.
We will go to jovanovic. Tell him we made
a big mistake. Give him the money back.
But... Charlotte, hi.
Richard! What are you
doing here?
- There's a very big problem with the coffee trade.
- Don't tell me. You're leaving.
- This is very important to me.
- And I'm not?
Of course you're important.
You are the most important thing
in the world to me,
except for this other thing
I gotta do now.
This better be an emergency.
It is. We're gonna die.
Does anyone know where Mimi is?
Mom, Mimi's doin' something bad.
Oh!
Well, um, isn't that
interesting?
Me cook real fish. You taste?
Try everything once,
I always say.
Oh. Hot. Okay.
That is very tasty.
Where'd you get the fish?
Mom, Tarzan's eating
daddy's fish.
House pond.
House pond?
- We'll manage to survive this, okay?
- Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say.
- I got kids to feed.
- So do I!
Yeah, but mine want
nike and Nintendo.
Yours wants blowguns
and meow mix.
Beluga. Best caviar
in whole world.
- Oh, yes, yes. Bar none, the best.
- Oh, it's delicious. Very tasty.
- Yes. Uh-huh.
- It's very good.
- Taste. - No, not without toast points.
- No, thanks.
- Gotta have toast points and capers.
- Tempting, tempting.
- Taste!
- Yeah, all right. Look at that.
- Right out of the fish. Mmm!
- Mmm!
- Mmm! Mmm!
- Mmm!
- Oh, it's so fishy.
- Very fishy.
- With egg...
- Eggy, fishy.
Morrison tell me
coffee now below 70, no?
We were as shocked as you are.
- Ow!
- Much lower than 75.
We think it was wrong
to sell you the coffee futures.
- We want to buy them back.
- How much?
The same. A million dollars.
You lose money.
Oh, don't worry about that.
W-we value your friendship
is what it is.
And our fingers.
- Very good.
- I do not know.
Wh-what's not to know?
Y-y-you're cleaning up here.
You are shrewd men.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Believe me,
shrewdness is not
in the picture.
I told you.
Time heals everything.
It just...
oh, the door's locked.
W-well, that's a statement,
I guess. Okay, so...
I'll keep these certificates
at my house and...
don't worry about me. I'm sure
there's a train I can take.
It's not like it's a dangerous
neighborhood or anything.
Hi. How ya doin'?
And this is supposed
to be a bribe?
Is it working?
It's pretty effective.
I'll get some champagne.
And I'll change into
something more comfortable.
Huh?
Oh, no. Oh, girl,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.
It was an accident.
Come on.
Coco, coco. Come on. Coco? Coco?
Michael, I was thinking about
taking tomorrow morning off.
Yes, that... oh, that's a great
idea. Whatever you'd like to do.
'Cause then it would... it would just be...
it would just be you and me, wouldn't it?
Coco? Coco, coco.
Here. Snap out of it. Come on.
Come on, coco.
You're killing me. Wake up!
Coco, what's that?
It's a mouse! Go get it!
Oh.
Coco, coco, coco. Coco? Coco?
- Jan!
- Now, where is this champagne?
Let's go in the kitchen.
You're so feisty today.
It's so nice to see you and coco
getting along so well.
She's so fast. Oh!
What do you say we take
the champagne...
And drink it in the bedroom?
So, uh, let me just
get this clear in my head.
Y-you... you thought what?
That I wouldn't notice?
Those fish cost me
thousands of dollars!
I think what we have here is an
intercultural misunderstanding.
Oh, well, why don't you tell that
to my yellow dwarf cichlids?
- Because they can't hear anymore!
- Fish taste good.
Well, let's hope so, Mimi. 'Cause you
just downed $10,000 worth of Sushi.
There's still one left.
Winky.
My most loyal fish.
Remember how he used to always
follow my finger across the glass?
Now I'm gonna
have to go like this.
Everybody, go to bed.
It's late. Give me this.
- No. Uh-uh.
- Yes. Come on, sweetheart.
All right, keep it.
Mimi, you go to bed too.
- It's just... you know, I mean...
- Okay. Come on. Come on.
- It's one thing to...
- Come on.
I... you've no idea
what this kind of...
yes, I know.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait. Now.
You pinare now.
- Choose a name.
- Choose for me.
- Ukume.
- What?
- Ukume.
- What does it mean?
It means "sound of, of rain
on river water."
Ukume. It's pretty.
Jan! Jan!
You're goin' to camp.
End of discussion.
- Dad! But, mom, we didn't do anything.
- Not understand problem.
Look, I'll tell you
the problem, Mimi.
You started a wildfire in my yard,
you ate my yellow dwarf cichlid...
And now you're putting the moves
on my 12-year-old daughter.
- Okay?
- But that's just not true.
Oh, well, there. See? See? Maybe
you're overreacting, Richard.
- I was putting the moves on him.
- Tell me I didn't hear that.
Well, now, honey, honey, maybe
we should be very grateful...
- That this happened at home.
- Mom!
- Hold on!
- Mom, nothing happened!
Well, you know what, Karen?
You're still goin' to camp.
- An all-girls camp.
- Yes!
My name's not Karen anymore.
It's ukume.
First dibs on ukume's room.
Oh, now, this makes me feel
a whole lot better!
Karen? Karen, honey?
I-I still don't
understand the problem.
No, Mimi, not now.
He might bite you.
- Hello? - Richard, it's morrison.
- Come on. Come on.
- Yeah?
- Let's just go away.
- I just had another visit from jovanovic.
- Yeah?
- Oh-h-h, then you haven't seen what's happening this morning?
- S-seen what?
Price of coffee, soaring.
And jovanovic thinks
you screwed him.
He may be coming by
for the certificates.
You mean he's angry?
Boy, coco, you slept
like a log last night.
- Charlie?
- Hmm?
How would you feel about
Mimi being in the wedding?
I thought he was
gonna be gone by then.
- Remember, it's just you and me this morning.
- I remember.
- No, business, no Mimi.
- What is it, Richard? I can't...
stop, stop, stop, stop. What?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Don't panic, please.
Now, should we go out for breakfast,
or do you think we should stay in?
Michael?
Okay, everybody!
Change of plans!
Jan, you take everyone out
for a big breakfast!
And bring a change of clothes!
- I told you.
- Karen, we don't have time for this, honey.
I'm not goin'
to an all-girls camp!
Karen, open this door
right now! Do you hear me?
Calm down. What is going on?
- ...a big knife!
- Karen, open the door right this minute!
You get the car ready.
I'll take care of her, okay?
- Go! Go! Please, please! Go! Go!
- All right, all right.
Andrew, clear the door.
Cool.
Karen! Open this door.
Karen, open this door right now!
Do you hear me?
- Your father's very mad.
- I'm not coming out!
- I'll get some matches. We'll smoke her out.
- Andrew, get back here!
I can handle this. Karen, this is
getting really, really boring!
Open it! Come on!
- Any word from the Russians?
- Not yet. No, no.
- Karen, open up!
- What's goin' on?
Karen has locked herself
in the bedroom. Okay?
Come on, honey. Open this door,
or you know what's gonna happen?
Andrew is gonna smoke you out!
How about that?
- Cool!
- I am kidding. Get back here.
Calm down. Please, calm down.
Where's Mimi?
Uh, Mimi? I don't know. He's probably in
a bar hitting on a cocktail waitress.
- What?
- Karen! Your son just spent the night...
In his hammock
with my daughter, okay?
- Was there a pot involved?
- No, there was no pot involved.
- You have nothing to be upset about, then.
- There is nothing to be upset about?
- No!
- Come here. There's no reason to be upset, huh?
Well, how about the fact that your son ate
my prizewinning fish, including winky?
And the fact that the Russian
mafia is due here any moment.
I guess you're right.
That's a pain
that's here to stay.
Richard, screaming's no way
to deal with a child, all right?
Oh, what? Are you suddenly Dr. Spock here?
You've been a father for three days.
- And you're giving me lessons? That's good.
- You sound like an idiot.
I'm a parent;
Therefore, I'm an idiot.
I have spent every day for the last
12 years worrying about my kids.
About their safety, about their
happiness, about their crooked teeth.
- No offense, Andrew.
- None taken.
But of course none of this
means anything to you,
because in the next few days
your son will be gone.
Open this door! Karen!
Open up! I've gotta
get her out of here.
Look, two shoulders are better
than one, right? Come on.
Baboon is here. He make peace.
All right!
- Oh!
- Ohh.
- Awesome fall, dad.
- Thank you, Andrew.
Okay, we gotta get jan and the kids into
the car before jovanovic gets here.
Andrew, meet me downstairs.
- You okay, daddy?
- Yeah, I'm fine. L-l-let me lean on you, honey. Ow.
- Mimi, come on downstairs.
- Coming.
Anybody can land on their feet.
- Okay, Andrew, let's go! Let's go. We're going.
- Where are we going?
- Wh... uh, the... French toast sale going on.
- What's the matter?
Good morning.
Sorry.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Give me coffee certificates.
We-well, you don't think that I would keep
certificates like that around my house, would you?
- Don't make me lose temper.
- Ow. Ow. Ow.
- Dad keeps everything I-in the bookcase.
- Andrew! Ow.
Behind the Bible
and Judith krantz.
Thank you, Andrew.
Oh. Scruples.
Could not put it down.
Oh.
All right, so, so, uh,
you have your certificates,
and I would appreciate it if you would
just take them and leave my house.
- Sit.
- Sure.
First, I teach you never
to make fool of jovanovic again.
Rope him down.
"Rope him down"?
I have an idea.
- You'll need these.
- What? What?
Ow! C-couldn't we discuss this
over a lovely cup of coffee?
- Quiet!
- Or jan could whip up some borscht.
- You make a fool of jovanovic.
- No.
In front of my comrades,
my community.
You waste my time.
You try to cheat me.
- Oh!
- Now you must pay.
Sit still, coward!
Now, I teach you...
Never, never to make a fool
of jovanovic again.
Eeny?
- Meeny?
- Mm-mm.
Miney? No. Need
that one for traffic.
Mo.
Huh? What?
Spider! Oh, I hate spiders!
Kill spider! Kill spider
quickly! Not me! Spider!
Don't move!
The spider will kill you!
Kill spider. Shoot.
Shoot, boy. Go ahead.
Don't worry about mess!
- Get him, Mimi!
- I'm coming, daddy!
Help me!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
- Get away!
- Don't you do that to my son!
Show 'em what
the kempsters are made of!
Bite him, Andrew!
Use those crooked teeth!
Crap!
Shoot again, baboon!
Shoot again!
Good boy, Andrew!
Daddy?
Don't shoot.
Baboon, when thumb doesn't work,
pinare do this.
Oh, that's gotta hurt. Oh!
I'm startin' to really
like that spider.
Please, please, don't point
spider at me any longer!
I'm going. I'm going.
I have many enemies,
but none like that spider.
Drive!
Karen, time to come
inside, baby!
I want you to have this.
Well, Mimi,
here's all your stuff.
Better get goin', huh?
Your dad's waiting.
Bye, Michael. Bye, Mimi.
Come on. I'm gonna
take you someplace.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Come here. Come on.
Last time I was here,
I bought that for your mom.
I want to go back home.
- You sick?
- No.
You sure?
All right. Um, but we gotta come
back here in a couple of days.
Tell you why. Fourth of July.
It's like that fanenteyou celebration
of yours, but here it's big.
There's boats everywhere that you
can see and thousands of people.
And at night, they... they shoot off
fire in the sky like you've never seen.
I failed the chief, baboon.
How did you fail the chief?
Didn't get the fire
from the statue of liberty.
The fire isn't real.
Well, the fire's in here.
Chief knows that.
I miss paliku.
I want to go back home.
Home.
All right.
Ouch. Oh, almost forgot.
- You'll be needin' this.
- You keep it.
- No, Mimi. Here. Mimi. Come on. Come on. Come on. Here. Here.
- No, no, no, no, no.
If you kill a fly,
you will be a real pinare.
Yeah, like that's gonna happen.
You know, I will practice.
That way I can come down
and hunt with you.
You'll never come to lipo lipo.
American airlines announces
the final boarding call...
For flight 935
to caracas, Venezuela.
- Time to go.
-  Gate 48.
-  All passengers should be on the airplane now.
- Thanks for the blowgun.
Mimi, I got you somethin'.
It's for you, but I want you
to open it in the plane.
Don't open it now.
I also got you this.
Fire from statue.
Fire from statue.
Pretty cool, huh?
Be careful with it though.
Wakatepe?
Wakatepe.
Charlie, I got a great idea.
What do you say you and I
get the hell outta here?
Tomorrow. Just the two of us.
Head out to our favorite spa.
That big suite. Just
get to know each other again.
- That's not good for me, darling.
- Me neither.
I really want to film all that,
but I've got an appointment with
my chiropractor this weekend.
You know how much my bloody back
affects my whole work.
- Oh, I know.
- We could do it a week Friday.
- That's not good for me.
- It's good for Ian.
- Well, whatever's good for Ian.
- I-I suggest we go for a following Wednesday.
Wednesdays are good.
Cromwell! Cromwell, coffee's
up another two points.
My boys, I never
doubted you for a minute.
What do you say we go down
to the trading floor...
With those certificates
and make us some money?
Money is honey.
Look at those prices!
Boys, we're gonna clean up!
- Did I ever tell you about cocoa in '73?
- Many times.
Oh, there I was
with 800 pounds of cocoa...
Back in the days before
greed became a dirty word.
Now, I don't have to explain
that to you, my boy.
You're a professional.
But that cromwell, he's
a disaster waiting to happen.
I don't know what's
going on with him.
Between me and you,
cromwell has become...
A colossal pain in the...
yes!
- Yes!
- Uh, George?
Uh, get him something.
Michael, where you goin'?
"And not only did he learn by..."
- "experience."
- "Experience, but...
- "Instincts...
- Good.
Long dead, became alive again."
- Baboon?
-  I nailed a fly.
- No!
-  You don't believe me. I'll show you.
- When?
-  Right now.
Baboon! Baboon!
Baboon!
Man, look at you.
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, oh.
Now you're a pinare, baboon.
Will you stay with me
in lipo lipo?
For a while. If you
teach me how to hunt.
Oh. Got you something.
Maybe you can use this.
The real deal.
How's Karen?
I don't know. Why don't you
ask her yourself?
Now that's a very big bug.
Um, honey, this isn't one
of those topless tribes, is it?
Don't even think
about that, Andrew.
I can't, dad. I'm too nauseous
from the boat ride.
Ukume! Ukume!
Mimi! Mimi!
- Karen!
- Karen!
I thought I'd never
see you again.
Looks too hot. Too hot.
Look at my hand!
Mmm, it starts in the heart
mmm, way down in your soul
mmm, it starts in the heart
mmm

to get there from here

way down in the soul
that's the only place

will only come if we believe
starts in everything you say
every smile and every way
starts the moment that you see
there's more to life
than you and me
love is not a mystery
- starts the moment we believe.
