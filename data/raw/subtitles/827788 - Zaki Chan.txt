Shame on you, shame on you man,
you let a chick beat the hell out of you
- How are you doing? What? What is it?
- Hey Sayed
You're so high-strung man,
let's get out of here
- Just wait a minute
- Come on, it's 3 am
- Hold on a minute, Sayed
- Let's go, you're here every day
- Just give me a minute, Sayed
- Come on, we have to go
- Just a minute
- Come on, get up
Come on, they're
gonna lock us in, man
You're so strange, pal
You play video games
every day, every day, man
I'd like to get me one
of these games at home
- Zaki
- What?
- We're in trouble, brigands
- Brigands? What do they do?
- Brigands, they're bandits
- Bandits? That's fine, come with me
- What are you going to do?
- Don't you worry
Look Sayed, I want to follow
exactly every move I make
Just do exactly as I do
Fine
Good evening, dudes
God bless you, my dearest boy and
protect you from any imminent danger
What a nice fellow
Bring out all the dough
you've got, my good pal
Why is that, man?
You're making a big mistake
- You shouldn't have said ''bring out''
- I said bring out all the dough you've got
Take your hands off me,
coz this is a new jacket, pal
See Sayed? That's just fine or
you want me to do it the hard way
Take off this new
jacket of yours, pal
By the way, you nearly
brought me down to the floor
That's fine, that's okay
Here's my new jacket, here you go,
it's got my picture as a little boy
But you may have it,
enjoy looking at it
- Take off your pants too
- No, I can't take my pants off
- Yes, I will take my pants off
- Go quickly
Give me a minute, you're trying to start a
fight with me, I don't wanna hurt you, man
- Quickly
- Fine, I'm taking it off
By the way, this is so
wrong, we're neighbors
I live in the fourth floor of that building
- I said, hurry up
- Fine, fine, just take it easy
Here is my pants, here you
go, although it's a bit loose
What about you, sweet little boy,
why don't you take off your clothes?
- You're waiting for your nanny's help?
- I won't take insults from him, Zaki
I'll do whatever you want,
just let me handle my friend
What's your problem Sayed? I told
you to follow exactly every move I make
Take off the shirt, you
- What did you just call him?
- Sweet little boy
Thanks, go ahead sweet little boy
- Do it quickly, and your pants too
- No, not my pants
What's this? You've tied your
pants to your face, Sayed?
Here you go sir, just give me
a second to get the other stuff
Excuse us for the delay
Why don't you give the
boys our honorary suits?
- My God
- Don't let them leave like this
And take a special care of this one,
he's been a very bad boy and I like him
- Okay
- Thank you, see?
He likes me, you'd better
listen to what I say the next time
Quickly, man coz I'm shivering
Thank God, dad's not awake
Gamal's asleep too
In God we trust, Amen
In God we trust, Amen,
come over here
- Me?
- Yeah you? Who would am I calling then?
Where were you until
this late hour, Zaki?
- I... was saying the early morning prayer
- The morning prayer? What's this?
- What?
- What the hell is this shape you're in?
What is it?
You were saying the morning
prayer looking like this?
- No
- What then?
- Just let me explain
- You did it again?
- Did what again?
- You did it again, Zaki?
You did it again, you good for nothing
- Just let me explain, dad
- What will you explain?
You went there again and let them
steal your clothes and beat you up again?
- No, no, that's not true
- Again? It's not true?
You're totally shameless, boy?
Don't you have any feelings?
Don't you have feelings
you stupid useless boy
You tore off my pocket, daddy
It just fell down, here
you go, here you go, boy
You're happy now? Do I have
a monkey in this house?
Since you're not up to the challenge,
why do you go them to get beaten up?
I didn't get beaten up, daddy,
I did the beating myself
Oh yeah, I've knocked hell out
of them and this is their pajamas
- Where are your clothes?
- With them
You want me to leave
them totally naked?
No, how come? It's not right
You want me to spend a fortune on your
food on clothes and your assailants' too?
- Just calm your nerves, dad
- Have pity
- Calm down dad
- Have pity on me
- You're so hot dad
- Hot? That's none of your business
You'll kill me one day
Come here, I'm so tired,
I can't take, come over here
- Just leave me alone dad
- Take this, Zaki, take, my heart
- My heart
- What is it, dad?
- My heart
- What's wrong dad?
- My heart
- See? You always pull that trick and I buy it
- Oh yeah, you're such a weasel
- See? I can catch you
- Where would you go, Zaki?
- No dad
Stop right there,
I said don't move, holy shit
You shouldn't tear off
other people's clothes?
What would I say now?
I was just playing with my dad?
Playing with you dad,
you insolent little boy
Come here, you think I won't catch you?
You're gonna spend the night out?
Come over here, don't give me
such a hard time, boy come
Don't you throw apples
at me dad, no, no, no
You're gonna cripple me, boy,
you're gonna cripple me
- What is it dad?
- You insolent
What are you yelling at?
Come and see what is your
troublesome brother doing
What's all the fuss about, dad?
A bunch of guys hit me, took my
clothes and got what they deserve
Who hit you and took your clothes
and got what they deserve?
Nobody hit me,
I didn't leave my house
- It's your brother
- Who hit you and took your clothes...
- ...and got what they deserve?
- Some guys living around the block
Give me a minute, I'll go get changed
and bring them over here shackled
Don't do it Gamal, I don't want
you to go get somebody else
My own brother got hit and
you want me to just stand still?
Just wait for some other day,
I'll be able to come with you
Listen, since I got up,
I have to start a fight
Suit yourself
- Where to, honey?
- I'm up and I have to start a fight
Why don't you wait until I deliver my
baby so that I can give you a hand?
You hit him first, honey
- Hey Ziko
- Hey Suraya
- How are you doing, Ziko?
- How is your unborn baby?
Your brother's boy is giving
me such a hard time
He's always on the
move, just like his father
- Salem, good morning
- Salem?
- I'm just kidding with you, Salem
- Fine
- Would you like to have for dinner?
- I'd like to have some nice cheese
I'll fix you a nice dish
of beans in a flash
Walk steadily, you
don't wanna stumble
- You really are an insolent boy
- Why is that?
You haven't had enough already,
you still want to have something to eat?
You want me to starve?
We're running out
of apples or what?
It's the seventh one
What's this?
Holy shit, what the hell is this?
What is this?
What the hell? Ain't this
the TV remote control?
Why is it in the fridge?
Lest it should melt?
This is sheer madness,
I don't get it, what's going on?
That's so unbearable
My sweet boy, an angel
sleeping amongst rubbish
ls this possible? Is this
possible? What's this?
What's this? Who'd sleep with...?
Holy shit, what's this?
Could he be using
this as a sleeping pill?
Why is he holding it in his arms?
What's this? What's this?
What's this?
What's this dad?
It's the same thing everyday
Cigarettes and tea for breakfast?
You're smoking too?
- Not me, it's Sayed
- Who's Sayed?
My friend, Sayed Sika
Why would your friend
Sayed Sika smoke outside
and put his cigarette
off in my house?
- Their house is a bit small
- You're joking?
- No, I'm not
- You're joking? I'm sick and tired of you
Get up, get away
from this dump of yours
- Fine, fine
- Get up
- Fine dad
- Why are still sitting? Get up
- Just stay put, dad
- Why?
So that I can throw
them in the glass
- In the glass?
- You want me to throw them on the floor?
No, throw them in the glass
we're supposed to drink with
You filthy boy, you filthy boy
- And what the hell is this?
- It's my shoes
I know it's not your jacket,
why is it sleeping in your arms?
Why? Have pity on me
- Go on, get up, get up, get up
- I spend hours looking for it each morning
Fine, there it is, not on
the bed, go on, get up
- Okay, okay
- Get up
Just give me five minutes, I'll have
a quick dream and I'll be back
Where will you be back? I'm not
waiting for you in here, get up
- Here I am, here I am
- Get the hell up, you're always like this?
You're either taking a nap
or sleeping or taking a bath
The bathroom is available or should
I obey the call of nature in a drawer?
- You do it in a drawer?
- You want me to do it on the balcony
The balcony is much more suitable, it's
open air whereas a drawer is a closed area
The hell with you
and your filthy habits
- Go ahead, you can use the bathroom
- Okay
You used up all the water
available, go ahead, go on, quick
- I'll be right with you, I'll be right with you
- Fine
What a fuss early in the morning
Go wake your wife, Gamal
Never mind my wife, dad, she's
pregnant and feeling tired, you know
She went to sleep
after cleaning the house
- That's okay
- Give me a loaf of bread, Gamal
This bread ain't fresh,
a bit of beans, cheese and jam
- A nice quick breakfast
- Why don't sit and eat like normal people?
That's normal dad, lots of people
have their breakfast while standing up
How nice, you find the
right answer for everything
Forget about him dad, it's
a disgusting human being
What Gimo? Aren't you
forgetting something?
- Just leave him alone, dad
- Exactly, exactly
Thank God
Why don't you shut the
door like normal people?
Lots of people slam the door, dad
- Why don't you throw me a frying pan?
- Beat it
What the hell am
I gonna do with this boy?
- Where did I go wrong?
- Divorce me
If you don't like it,
divorce me, what's this?
God damn it Sara
What's your bloody
problem? I'll be right down
You've been saying that
for almost an hour now
Why should I be the one to suffer
the consequences of your car crash?
The cigarette
It's you? You scared me shitless
- Where is dad?
- He left early
You're still in your boxer? Go get
dressed, Sara's going bonkers
I don't wanna go to
the swimming courses
Same thing every morning
I'll go call dad, and let him deal with it
- Go ahead, go on
- Call him
What's this Omar? I thought we're done
with that, you want me to be mad at you?
Stop begging, let me talk to Shereen
Hi Shereen, how are you doing?
You haven't received your car yet?
It's no big deal,
I'll pick you up after work
And we'll all have
lunch in the club
Bye
- What is it, Mr. Khayrat?
- Omar's giving me a hard time
And Shereen is such a reckless girl
She crashed the car
again, can you believe it?
Why don't you get her a
driver and be done with it?
What driver? He won't last
for more than a ride with her
We already have a driver
but he's of no good use
- Hey Sika
- Hey man
You piece of chicken, why didn't
you drop by me in the morning?
- I was here
- What's new?
Everything's just fine, Mr. Nader
is looking everywhere for you
- Really? What did you tell him?
- What?
- Well said, let's get in
- Come on
It's gonna take a year or what?
Stop right there you two
What is it? Where the
hell do you think you are?
- Why are you so late?
- Me?
It's Sayed who just arrived,
I've been here since the morning
- Then go to work
- Right away
Come over here, it's your
last warning, do you hear?
- Do you hear?
- Yes sir
He won't do it again
Just let me go get changed coz my
clothes must be soaked wet by now
Excuse me
- I'll be back in a minute
- Okay honey
- I missed you
- Shame on you
- We must get married first
- Such a well-mannered girl
Excuse me, I'd like
to have a glass of water
- Yes
- A glass... a glass of water
A glass of water?
Samira? Samira Bahig?
- Zaki? How are you doing, honey?
- I'm fine, how are you doing?
- I'm fine, how are you?
- You look gorgeous
You grew up into a
stunningly beautiful lady
You got engaged?
- Really?
- Yeah
You remember
Shukry from college?
- Shukry? Shukry El Sayed?
- Yes
You must be kidding me? That
Shukry who had a pronunciation issue?
- Well, he was the only one available
- How could you do it? how could you do it?
- That's unbelievable
- Oh sweetie
Do you still remember when you
used to run away from class
and meet me at the
men's room, remember?
- Shukry
- Yes I know, I remembered him
No need to remind me
of him, I know who he was
Remember when your zip was stuck and
I held it to you all the way back home?
- Shukry
- Yes I remember him
Shukry, you remember...
You remember when he
used to catch us by surprise?
Those were some good old days,
but it only happened in the 3rd year
Shukry
- You wanted some water?
- Yes
- With ice?
- It doesn't matter
I'll be right back
- Shukry
- Yes, it's Shukry
How are you doing Shukry?
We were just talking about you
- How are you doing Shukry?
- Fine
He's just the same old man
- He's still catching us by surprise
- Yeah
- How are you doing Shukry?
- How are you?
You remember those
days back in college
when we used to read
all together in the library?
But I wanna tell you something,
you picked the right girl, just the right girl
- Samira Bahig, some good old memories
- Some shit memories
Damn you and your shitty memories
You piece of shit,
you've always been a moron
You got me all wrong
- Got you wrong?
- Yeah, she just wanted some water
- And it's just about water?
- Believe me
I spent 3 years with you stupid cow,
and couldn't even get a small kiss
3 years? It's way
too much with Samira
- You're about 2 years and 6 months late
- You see what I'm talking about?
- That's okay, that's okay
- Where's the manager of this place?
- Where's the manager?
- What is going on here? What's going on?
- You're the manager?
- What's going on?
I went away for
3 seconds, 3 seconds
And came back to see him talking to
her about zips and something like that
- How dare you?
- Sir, let me explain, let me explain
- Don't you say a word
- He's engaged to a promiscuous girl
- What can I do for him?
- Make him pay for it sir, make him pay
How dare you?
Get the hell out of here
I don't ever wanna
see your face here again
You're a piece of shit just like her
- Get out
- Your voice will bring down the walls on us
Get out
What is it Hazem? Why are
you tearing off the roses?
- Have pity on them
- What are the roses for?
To be picked, right?
The most beautiful rose to the
most gorgeous girl in the world
Thank you so much
It's Sara, we'd better leave
or else she's gonna get mad
Let's go
- Good after noon
- How are you doing, dad?
Where is Omar?
- Daddy
- Hi Omar, how are you doing?
- How's your swimming practice?
- It's fine
But the pool water is too
cold, and I'm so hungry
- Let's eat
- Dad, wish Sara a happy birthday
- Today's her birthday
- Really? Happy birthday
Thank you sir, I'd better leave to get ready
for tonight, I'll be waiting for you tonight
And don't you be late, don't
come when the party's over
- Bye
- Bye
- What can I do for you sir?
- Would you serve us lunch quickly
I'm in a hurry
- I'd better go now
- Fine Hazem
I'll see you at the
birthday party, bye
What's this Omar?
You've spent the whole
day playing video games?
Turn it off and go to sleep right now
- Just give me five more minutes
- Not a single minute
You'd better do as I tell you,
go to sleep right now, go ahead
Why don't I get
anything but trouble?
- Well, good night
- Good night
Hazem, I don't like it when
you're so forward with me
You promised me a hundred
times to quit drinking
- And you're still doing it
- Knock it off Shereen
It's a birthday party,
we were having fun
- See you later
- Bye
How very nice
Do you know what time is it?
Sorry dad, everybody
was having a good time
I don't give a shit about this nonsense
You were supposed to
stay for just half an hour
It's not right to leave
as soon as I got there
And is it right to let a guy
drive you home at midnight
- It's Hazem, dad
- Why should Hazem drive you home?
Why didn't you ask me
to send you the driver?
Dad, I did nothing wrong
It's obvious that you've
been too much spoiled
Go to sleep now, I'm gonna have
a word with you in the morning
You just can't stay in one
job for too long, can you?
Each day, you drag me...
I'm talking to you, what
the hell are you looking at?
I'm trying to talk some
sense into your stiff head
And you're looking the other way?
- Stop being so impolite
- I thought I heard somebody calling
Most importantly, is your
manager a nice man?
- He's a very nice man, dad
- Then why did he give you the sack?
- Coz he's so mean and unjust
- Yeah
- Is he nice or mean and unjust?
- He's a mixture of all that
- A mixture? What's his name?
- Nader
Nader the mixed man, come on
Zaki told me about the misunderstanding
that took place between you two
I gave him a good scolding
Sure thing,
I reprimanded him severely
And I insisted on bringing
him here to apologise for you
- And settle this small disagreement
- What disagreement Mr...?
Salem, I'm Salem El Asyuty
- Father of Zaki Salem El Asyuty
- Yeah
- What?
- Don't you worry...
He still hasn't had breakfast
Allow me Mr. Nader,
I'd like to say something
You were so unfair with me, I swear
by my dad's life, and I've never ever lied
I didn't hit on nobody, that was Samira
Bahig, we both went to the same college
- What? He's talking about Samira
- Yeah
- Your college classmate?
- Yeah
No, no, Mr. Nader, no, no, it's just
Samira, she's like a sister to him
They used to drink the
same milk as babies
If that's so, why did
that guy fight with you?
- Dad, ask me about that guy
- Of course I will, who's that guy?
Shukry El Sayed, her fiance
- Shukry El Sayed got engaged?
- Yes he did
- Shukry El Sayed
- Yes he got engaged a while ago
- God help him
- He got engaged dad, he's not dead
Well he's gonna end up dead
Shukry El Sayed and Samira?
If I'd known it's about Shukry and Samira,
I wouldn't have come to see, Mr. Nader
They're like a brother
and sister to him
Go kiss uncle Nader, go ahead,
go ahead, do it for dead, go on
- Uncle Nader is a nice fellow
- Get the hell out of here
Get the hell out and stop this charade
What's this nonsense? Take
your dad and get the hell out
- Move it, go on
- Don't be startled by his loud voice
Go on, uncle Nader told you to
move, then move back to work, boy
Isn't that so, Mr. Nader?
Go ahead, no need to kiss him
Go back to work,
move it Zaki, move it
I'd better leave too,
Nader, take care
What the hell is this family?
What a goddamn species
- Good morning
- Good morning
- What would you like to have?
- What drinks do you serve?
We serve cold mango juice
- Don't you have something hot?
- We have hot mango juice
What a rude impolite man, Nader
There really are some rude and
impolite people, why are you yelling?
- Nader
- Why would you call him?
- Yes honey, what is it?
- What's this waiter you've got here?
- You again, what has he done now?
- He's hitting on me and Hiba
- I swear I didn't hit on Hiba
- You're hitting on Mrs. Ghada, you fool
- Who's Mrs. Ghada?
- She's my wife, you piece of shit
Holy shit, what
about Hiba? Who's she?
- Get the hell out of here
- Okay, I will
Get the hell out of here
You seem exhausted
today, Mr. Khayrat
I'm so worried, I'm so worried
about Shereen, she's misbehaving
I need somebody to watch
over Shereen day and night
- And I don't have the time for that
- Ain't Linda living with them?
I need somebody to keep their
company in and outside the house
Somebody who'll be their
shadows, a bodyguard
- I want a bodyguard, Salem
- A bodyguard
Yeah I know them
Aren't they the bunch of muscular guys in
blue suits, who always act before they think
- These are exactly the bodyguards
- What do you need them for Mr. Khayrat?
You're going to war?
or is Shereen starting a fight with
everyone she meets on the street
you got me wrong, Salem
I don't need someone to
start fights or bully everybody
I want someone to follow
them like a shadow
Take care of this
issue for me, Salem
Sit down, Gamal, sit down
I wanna discuss an
important issue with you
- Open up your mind
- Yes dad
- I want you to get me a bodyguard
- A what?
- A bodyguard
- A bodyguard?
- Yeah
- A bodyguard?
- Yeah
- Why?
- Has anyone bothered you?
- No
- Has anyone laid hands on you?
- No
- Has anyone hurt you in any way?
- No, let me explain
Then what do you
need a bodyguard for?
- Just let me speak for once
- What do you need a bodyguard for, dad?
- Just let me explain
- Why is that?
- Bodyguard? How nice
- I said nothing
I know that you're always around
- You're so weird, Gamal
- Why do you need him then?
I don't need him
- It's Mr. Khayrat who needs one
- Okay
- You got it now?
- Yeah
Here you go, write down the
qualifications required in this bodyguard
- One, tall and muscular

On top of all, he must be
of a respected family
Well that's a problem
I want this bodyguard available
within a maximum of 2 days
A bodyguard, I barely have
enough time to get prepared
I needed a couple more days
- Hide me, hide me
- Where do you want me to hide you?
Anywhere, you're full of hideaways
Come on man, you're
gonna gulp me down or what?
Well done, Gamal, you're the
pride and joy of your father
You sent me a bunch of lions not men
How nice, how nice
These are natural muscles
or are they pumped out
They're natural, sir
- How great, how great, what's your major?

Why don't you have a seat?
I'll be right back, have a seat, have a seat
Five damn disasters!
I'll depend on the Lord
- What's your name?
- Mohd El Adawi
ls that so?
You're here all by yourself
or you're here with them?
- None of your business
- Fine, I meant you're a bunch of friends
And came here together
or you're all by yourself?
None of your business
Don't you get mad man, I'm just
having a chat with you, I fear for you man
Coz that guy sitting back there has been
speaking ill of you since we got here
- What are you saying?
- Yeah
But don't you look at him,
he seems stronger than you
- You know them?
- Each and every one of them
Tell me what you know
That guy's Nohad
That's Dagher and this
is Fayed (=overabundant)
Fayed? He should be so
- And that's Ashraf
- What a weird name
- Tell me about Ashraf
- His wife cheated on him
and ran away with her lover

- It's a done deal
- What have you done?
Everything's fine, they're waiting
for you outside to choose one

You're so heavy, man
I told you they're gonna hit
you but you wouldn't listen
Hold on until they come,
what took them so long? There they are
What's going on? What's
all this tumult in the office?
- What's this? What brought you here?
- Excuse me sir
They tried to bully me
so I taught them a lesson
I fit for this position quite well, sir
- This position?
- Impossible
Why is it impossible?
Beat it now, lad, go home
Mr. Khayrat, I'd like to tell you
something extremely important
- Come with me
- Nobody moves
- Mr. Khayrat, I'd like to tell you
- What do you wanna tell him?
That's okay, I sent them
all home, a bunch of rookies
I'll send you packing right away
- Mr. Khayrat, this guy is...
- Is an Olympic medalist
for the years 1 991
and 1 992 on the row
- Olympic medalist?
- Yeah
- You really are an insolent lad and a son of...
- Don't you insult my father
You shouldn't be speaking
like this, Salem, excuse me son
That's not the right way to deal
with your employees Mr. Khayrat
By the way, I'd like you to know
that I was the private bodyguard
of the Arab League secretary
and the hero Abd El Aziz
And haven't you been
employed at the Shehab Street
They did ask for my services there
But I preferred to come here,
coz it's near my house
Why don't you have a seat Mr. Salem?
Why don't you have a seat?
You should stand up
while speaking with me
- That's enough, that's enough
- No it's not enough
I brought with me all necessary
certificates for you to check them out
- What are all these pictures?
- This is me in my karate suit
- Karate?
- Yeah
- What belt do you hold?
- No, I have a bra
- What?
- I have a dark belt coz I love dark colors
This is my pictures
after we beat Egypt 2-O
- Were you playing with the Turkish team?
- Mr. Salem won't get off my back
In this photo, I'm holding the cup
- Who's this?
- It's me
- You?
- In my room
In the Olympics I mean, all these
pictures are taken in the Olympics
- What's this pic?
- I was just eating lunch here, nothing special
What do you think Salem? He seems
to me like a fine well-mannered fellow
He seems to me like an
ill-mannered son of a rascal
You're insulting my
dad again, Mr. Salem?
My dad is a respected
man, do you know him?
My dad's a very
respected man, Mr. Khayrat
He holds a very respected job but it
seems to me he's gonna get fired today
- What's your name?
- Zaki, sir
- What's your family name?
- Yeah, tell him your father's name
- It's no use telling you my father's name
- What's your father's name?
Tell me your full name
- My name is Zaki Nahed El Adawi sir
- Who?
Zaki Nahed El Adawi, this is my address,
come to see me tomorrow morning
I'm hired sir?
God bless you, God bless you sir
- You can leave now
- Thank you
Thank you Mr. Khayrat, thank you
See you later Salem, sit on
that chair, it's a very nice one
What do you think Salem?
I think he's a fine guy
and the right one
But Mr. Khayrat, I think
he's a devious crook
He might be devious
but he's no crook
I wanted a devious and cool guy like this,
I thought you'd choose him in the first place
ls that so? But I'm sure that he won't
show up here again, Mr. Khayrat
Holy shit
- I don't get it, why are you so edgy?
- Why? Because of your misdeeds
- You don't know why am I so edgy?
- Calm down dad
- You don't know why I'm edgy?
- Calm down dad
I'm sick and tired of you
- Calm down
- Save me this trouble
- You wanna be a bodyguard?
- Yeah
How can you be one?
You're just a bag of bones
And on top of this,
you're a cold-hearted fellow
- You're cold-hearted?
- Yeah
You've always treated me so hard
that I grew up having a heart of stone
How can you be so?
By eating myrrh every night
Would you like me
to get your sockets?
You're poking fun at me?
These were old files
and they're finished now
I'm struggling now, dad
- By being a crook, you son of a rascal
- Dad
- You son of a rascal
- Dad, dad
You're a badly brought-up
child, I won't let you go
- What is it, Zaki?
- Come here
You wanna make my dad lose
his mind, Zaki? Just let him go
You're the last thing I need
now, son, concentrate
- Zaki's behind you, I'm your dad
- What is it Zaki?
You wanna make
my dad lose his mind
you want him to get fired
because of a loser like you
I'm no loser anymore,
I'm working with his boss
We're both gonna get
paid from the same guy
I won't let you do it
- Dad, it's me
- You're standing in my way
- Get out of here
- Dad, dad
I don't get it, why don't you
want me to earn a living?
You're the only one who's gonna
make me lose my source of income
- Get out of there, get out
- I won't
Dear lord, my son's a mouse
- Get out of there, I'm warning you
- I won't
Very well, you
stay there, stay there
You can sleep under the bed
I'm not going to work tomorrow,
I'll be waiting for you
Let's see how long will stay
hidden under the bed, fine
This hose is leaking
This boy is insane,
he's totally insane
Due to my busy schedule,
I decided to get you someone
to keep you company
and take care of you
- What is it dad? You decided to get married?
- Who said anything about marriage?
I'm saying there are plenty
of things that must be fixed
Which means you need
someone to keep you company
in and outside of the
house, and mainly outside
In the car, in the club
- I reckon that my words are very clear
- You wanna hire someone to watch us?
I said someone to keep you
company and not watch you
- Good morning
- Good morning
- Is Mr. Khayrat here?
- Excuse me?
- Mr. Khayrat is home?
- Who's asking for him?
- Just tell him Zaki
- What do you want him for?
- He knows
- He knows?
Mr. Khayrat is not available
now, you can come again
- Okay, thank you, thank you
- I said he's not at home
- Good morning
- Hello Zaki, have a seat
And let me explain your main tasks
I know everything and
I got myself prepared too
- How nice
- Of course, don't you worry
Hold it sir, upon studying
the villa's location, it turned out to be low
I mean the villa's fence is too low
So it needs to be elevated for around 6
to 7 meters, we need cameras over here
- We need about 2000 meters of barbwire
- I didn't hire you to guard the villa
The factory then, well as for
the factory, hold it right there sir
As for the factory, we won't need
all the other stuff we spoke about
Except the barbwire,
we'll need it there
- Neither the factory
- Then the car, it's the only thing left
Well I don't deal with cars, you can
get a bulletproof body for the car
and a little dog who'll bark whenever
he sees a stranger near the car
- You got me wrong, sir, excuse me
- Wait right there
You're a chatterbox or what?
Let me tell you what I want
- I want you to watch over my kids
- Your kids?
- There they are
- You'd better get them a Philippine guard
Listen to me, I beg you
Let me introduce you
to Zaki, your bodyguard
This is a bodyguard? He's
more like a starving lizard
Excuse me
It's Shereen my daughter
and Omar my son
It's obvious that Shereen is your eldest
daughter and Omar your youngest
It's obvious that your
shoe lace is unfastened
Were you in a bit of a hurry?
I don't know how to fasten
my shoelace in the first place
Yeah
Well why didn't you say so?
I'm going to the club, let's go Omar
- Go with them Zaki, go ahead
- Of course
Listen, I want you to
follow Shereen step by step
- I want you to be Shereen's shadow
- What about Omar?
- Should I let him wander away?
- Omar too, please Zaki, go ahead
Fine sir, I'd like to thank you so
much for putting your trust in me
I'm a peaceful guy,
I would never start any fight
Follow them now, go on, go on
- Hold on a second
- What is it?
- Hold on a second, this is your car?
- Yeah it's my car
What are you doing?
Security measures, that's all
You need to blow up this tire
Look out
What's this? Did you
hear any explosion?
- It's the car's remote control
- The car's remote?
- What kind of a car are you driving?
- Take your hand off me, you're a total fool
- You're insane, you're insane, man
- What's this?
- Get up
- Thank God, no casualties
Hold on a second, hold on a second
Excuse me, where are the keys?
- What are you doing?
- Ain't this the driver's seat? I'm driving
- Look
- What's this?
- Do you happen to have a dumb uncle?
- No, my auntie was a bit chubby
- Really?
- Yeah
- Get up in the back
- Why?
- In the back
- I'm driving
- Come on Omar
- I'm driving
Step hard on the clutch
pedal if you're gonna drive
See? I told you this Zaki
won't show up in here again
I was completely sure he's
reckless and irresponsible
Zaki?
Zaki is with the kids at
the villa since the morning
he must be with them in the club now
Zaki is with the kids at the
villa and they went to the club?
God help us
- You're such a rude fellow
- What?
Why did you just turn off the music?
It's a quick rhythm and we
have a small kids in the car
Mind your own business
and don't you touch it again
Look in front of you, look in front of you,
we don't wanna have an accident
- By the way, you haven't shifted gears
- Gears?
- Yeah
- It's a campo hydrometric one
I'm talking about the car
not the washing machine
- Omar, give me the mobile
- Hold on a second
- What's this?
- Concentrate, concentrate, just a second
O12012012?
- Give me the mobile
- You know anybody living at the pyramid?
Give it to me
Hello, answer me you moron
- What the hell are you saying?
- Answer me you moron
You're happy now?
Get down and give a beating
to that moron who hit me
- I'd better not
- I said go down
Okay, dear lord help
me and protect me
- Get down
- What?
- Get down I'm telling you
- What is it?
What is it?
- Show me the driving license
- What? I don't have any license
You don't have any license?
What do I need it for?
I'm not driving the car
I know you're not driving,
if the driver is busing driving
Shouldn't you be watching the road?
How can he watch his driving
and the road as well?
It's not my problem,
I was watching the counter
It's the first time I get in a cab
If I had known this would happen
to me, I'd have never got in a cab
That's okay, it's no big deal
Since it's your first time, why
are you driving on a highway?
- This man is a complete maniac
- Shouldn't you drive on a side road?
- You're hurt?
- Move it man, you're blocking the road
That's okay
You'd better choose a
customer who can drive
She ran away
Come on guys, we're home, come on in
It seems like there's nobody home
Whatever I tell you,
you won't believe it
These people are
incredibly extraordinary
If only you'd see their daughter
Today she went saying, come
on in, you can't leave like this
Why don't you have dinner with us?
You can stay here if you like
- But I didn't wanna do it
- Really man?
You think I'm making up stories, Sayed?
I didn't wanna throw myself
on them? One step at a time
I wanted to impress them
with my strong personality
- What about the girl, is she beautiful?
- Well she's... gorgeous
and she's got that nice
little brother, he's so cute
He loved me at first sight
Can you imagine? He took me
in his arms and gave me a big hug
Zaki, don't you think
this job is a bit hard?
It's extremely hard with
terrible dangers and troubles
Zaki, I like this bodyguard
thing and wanna become one
- You wanna become a bodyguard?
- Yeah?
- Just take a look at your body, man
- What's wrong with it?
What's wrong with it? A bodyguard
must have certain qualifications
He must be tall and robust,
yeah, yeah just like me
I know you're looking at me coz
I've got the typical qualifications
You must have a muscular chest,
you're wearing a one-breast bra
You always enjoy
bursting my bubbles, Zaki
You want me to deceive you?
You want me to deceive you, Sayed?
- Besides, you're strongly built?
- No, frankly I'm not
You see? See?
Look I wanna tell
you something Sayed
Let's choose another street, Zaki
Don't you worry, you're
walking with a bodyguard
Here, take this
- Should I rest assured, Zaki?
- Come on Sayed, come on
Good evening, dudes
God bless you, my dearest boy and
protect you from any imminent danger
You sweet fellow
Cut the crap man,
some things have changed
Holy shit
- Shouldn't you knock first, dad?
- Have I startled you?
What is it?
You think that by doing what
you've done, you outmatched me
- Why dad?
- It's your call
You either quit your job or I quit
- Why don't you quit daddy?
- You really are an insolent lad
- Come over here, let me...
- Dad, you're gonna kill me
It's better than getting myself killed
You still haven't seen
anything, I'll show you
- You still haven't seen a thing, help me
- Why dad?
- Help me
- You make me feel like you're not your boy
What did you just say, boy?
You make me feel like you're
not your boy, you're not my son
- Who's the son of who?
- Would you let your dad do this to you?
If I did what you're doing, he's
welcome to do whatever he wants
- I love you by the way, I love you
- Why? You love me?
See how much I love you?
This one's still loose
You wanna cripple me then,
Let me see, let me see, yeah
- You're doing a pullover?
- Yeah I'm doing a pullover
I'm leaving, you stay like this
What do you think? Let me
see your strength, excuse me
What's this? A dart board?
Hit it, hit it
- What's this? What have you done?
- What have I done?
You screwed the door
- Should I aim at this rounded board?
- Of course
Stop yelling man
What's this sword?
It's fine, the infidels are long gone
So what? What if
you're holding a sword?
Listen, if you're gonna be Zena
I can very well be Hercules
What do you say if I stab you with
this sword right through your chest
And out of your back?
Right through my chest
and out of my back?
- Vertically you mean?
- No, perpendicularly
- Look
- What's this?
I can pull some
hideous tricks on you
I love adventures, no problem
- What if I made you see nightmares?
- I don't sleep at night, I sleep during the day
- Really?
- Yeah
- What are you doing?
- This is it
You wanna keep me company,
you do exactly as I tell you to
- Okay
- And follow my orders
Okay
- Look
- What?
- I don't like troubles
- Then what the hell are you doing now?
Mint tea
- You're gonna listen to me?
- Yes
Go get me my mobile,
I forgot it upstairs
You made all this fuss
to get your mobile?
Why didn't you just say so? What's this?
Where's this damn mobile?
Speak, where's the mobile?
Damn it
Good morning, good morning
Good morning, I wanna
check on you, how are you doing?
What? Can I sit with you for a while?
- No
- Thank you, I knew you wouldn't say no
- Can I play with you?
- I'd rather play by myself
Beware of this one, a hard blow,
B6, B6, you just hit him
You can't play like this, look
- Now, let's resume the game
- I don't wanna resume the game
Then you're scared
I might defeat you
- Look, if you can beat me, you'll get this
- Fine
- And if I defeated you, what would I win?
- This?
This?
You were shaving?
What would I do with this?
That's fine, no problem, start play
There you go, there
you go, next, next, next
Nice, you're defeated
Give it to me
- You wanna play again?
- Okay
- Okay? I'll strip you off
- I'll strip you off
Yeah honey
- I just arrived to the club
- But I can't make it now
I must go to the
company right away
- When will you finish?
- I don't know
But I surely can't make it now
What will you do now? You're
gonna leave or hang out at the club
No I'm leaving, bye
- Dear Lord, if only dad wasn't so nervous
- My dad's nervous too
And if he knew I'm here with you,
he's gonna give me a terrible scolding
Holy shit, he'll give you a scolding?
No, my dad's not that narrow-minded
If he knew we're all alone
in here, he'll rush in here
By the way, you're a loser in football
And you don't know
how to play car races
Leave me alone now,
I wanna stay by myself
It's my room, you're
angry coz I defeated you?
Don't you say that word
- Don't you have any other game?
- No
Give me back my clothes,
Give me back my clothes and my glasses
What are you looking at?
Who's this dog in the
picture? Is it your brother?
No that's my dog
- He's an Egyptian dog of course
- No, it's a Labrador
He's foreign then?
ls he studying abroad now?
- No, dad shot him down
- Why? did he steal anything?
- No, he was sick
- Holy shit
Do you usually shoot anyone
who gets sick around here?
I won't let you mock at my dog
What's this?
- Tell me, what was your dog's name?
- Titus
Titus? It's a good
thing he got killed, pal
May God forgive you
Omar, can I ask you something?
Don't you have any friends?
It's obvious that this dog
was your only friend
Fine... what's this?
You're crying, Omar?
What's this?
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to make you sad
If I knew you'd be so sad
I swear I wouldn't have mocked at him
Besides, consider me
like Titus from now on
- Of course not
- Of course not?
Am I that vicious?
Fine then, maybe the dog
is somehow better than me
but let's have a fresh start on this
bed and become friends, I'm sorry
Give me a hug now
to be sure you're not sad
The second mad kid
is here, excuse me
- I was sure you'd come back to me
- Get out of my way
It's obvious that these
stairs take us down
Once your dad comes
home, I'll tell him everything
- Hi Zaki
- Hello
What's wrong? Is any of the
kids causing you any trouble?
No, you have two little angels
What's wrong? You
seem in pain, what is it?
Nothing, it's just that this
red line is too tight, that's all
- Where are Shereen and Omar?
- Omar is in his room
And Shereen remained
home all day long
Great girl
I couldn't tell him, fine
But there are plenty of things
that need to be changed
There are plenty of parts aching
Just like we agreed,
I'll turn off the power
and you'll jump over and go
straight to his room and tie him up
Tie him to the bed, the chair,
the wardrobe, just anything
Then get out, just like
you went in, go ahead
Excuse me sir I didn't
wanna interrupt you
But I quited robbing houses and
jumping over villa fences, thank God
- It's not a new thing
- Since when?
A long time ago
Why didn't you tell me before
making a deal with you?
You waited until we're
under the villa to tell me that?
- What are you doing now?
- I'm a drug dealer
Forget about the drugs and go
back to robbing for just a minute
I can't Mr. Salem, I must be dealing
with drugs for a minimum of one year
and then I can shift
to another field
You think you're dealing
with the sea world?
Give it a try man, you're doing a
master's degree in drug dealing?
Forget about this and be a robber
- What if I got caught?
- Get caught, what the hell?
I'll turn you in myself
then I'll help you escape
You're gonna help me escape
from prison, you're really something
And you're really nothing,
you're a bloody fool
What do you mean by helping
you escape from prison?
Fine, fine, what if I got beaten up
No, don't you worry about that,
who's gonna beat you up?
- Just to be sure
- Yeah
Any slap you receive, what's wrong
with you? I said any slap you receive
- You're gonna hit me Mr. Salem
- You lost it man
I'll give you 100 pounds
for each slap you receive
- Where are you going?
- I'll bring down the knife
- What? We're committing murder or what?
- Get the hell out of here, I don't need you
What a damn drug dealer
What murder?
I'll just turn off the power
Dad, dad, there's a thief upstairs
I saw him jump over Omar's balcony
- A thief? Are you sure?
- I saw him in my own eyes
I'm gonna throw you
out of this house, Zaki
- What is it guys? What are you yelling at?
- They think there's a thief in the house
- A thief?
- Call the cops and I'll go get my gun
No dad, don't go upstairs dad,
please uncle Salem call the cops
The cops? Until the cops get here,
the thief would have long run away
- Where's Zaki?
- Zaki's in the bathroom
- Your mom would be thrilled right now
- Zaki, get out right now
- Zaki
- Yes
- Help us Zaki
- Yes
- Get out right now, there's a thief upstairs
- Tell him I'm on my way
What the hell are you doing?
Holy shit
Zaki, Zaki, come here Zaki
- What is it? what is it?
- There's a thief upstairs
- Go catch him and save us
- Let's wait until the power is back on
- Give him the light
- Allow me
- Is the thief a foreign guy?
- Yeah, he's French, go up
- Come on quick
- Go ahead, Ziko
What are you doing?
I'm flashing the light, he may
be coming down in a haste
How thoughtful
Mr. Thief
Mr. Thief
In fact, I didn't wanna get up,
but the guys downstairs insisted
So I came here to see
if you needed anything
Mr. Thief?
- Don't move
- Holy shit
- Don't move
- It's incredible
I've been talking to you
from here all this time
And you appeared from
the other way, well done
- I'm not just a common thief
- Yeah, yeah, and I'll let you rob me easily
Hold on the light like this,
yeah, I'm ready, take it all
- Quick
- Here's my watch
And this is my wallet,
it's got everything in it
Just leave me your house address,
don't put yourself in danger
just leave me your address and
I'll send you everything there
- To my house?
- Yeah
- You'll send it all?
- Yeah I'll send it all, whatever you need
Don't you worry
- Do something Salem, call the cops
- What do we need them for?
Zaki is the right person,
he can manage just fine
Ain't that what you always tell me?
Let's see what he's gonna do
You're right uncle Salem, he's
supposed to be a bodyguard
- Let him deal with it
- It's a big problem, what's going on?
It's in the garden
I'll go check the power
switch, maybe it's down
- Who is it? Zaki my neighbor
- Bayumi, my pal
- Zakawa
- Boomy
What the hell is going on with
you? Who tied you up like this?
- What an stupid piece of shit
- What brought you here?
- Didn't you quit?
- Yeah I quitted already
But your dad lured me in
- My dad?
- Yeah your dad, you know him?
- The bald man
- Yeah
- Yeah, yeah, he comes around
- He made a deal with me
Yeah I know, he told me everything
If he hadn't told me, how
would I let you tie me up?
Yeah, I noticed you
didn't show any resistance
- I miss you
- You too
- Don't you worry
- I should have cut my hand off
Before tying you up, bro
- How can I do this?
- No, it's no big deal, Bayumi
Just give me back my
watch before you leave
- Sure thing, I'd give it back double
- No, that's okay, I just want it
- I miss you man
- You too Ziko
- Give me a kiss
- While you're tied up?
- Yeah, no problem
- Okay
What a man
What if I've beaten the hell out
of you? What would you do?
I did my best to make you
lose your nerves and slap me
But it's no use, I would have
taken 100 pounds for each slap
My dad made this deal with you?
You filthy man, you
wanted to rob Mr. Khayrat?
- How many slaps until now?
- 700 slap
- I'll give you 200 more
- Then there are 2 slaps left
Hit me again, let's
reach a thousand
Hit me again, I want to quit
Why couldn't you quit
from the second slap?
That's enough, it's enough Zaki,
forgive and you'll be forgiven
- That's a loss
- A loss?
- I mean you're only wasting your strength
- Nevertheless, I won't stop
That's enough, it's enough,
it's no spendable money
I'll turn him in to the cops myself
Be careful, he might run
away, I tied him up real strong
Get away? Move it you loser,
go ahead and jump, go on
Well done Zaki, I'm so proud of you
I don't know what we'd
have done without you
We'd be robbed by now or even slain
Anyway, drop by me
at the office tomorrow
- I will
- Come on, let's go to sleep
What about me? I won't sleep?
That's fine
- Here you go
- What's this?
It's a reward from Mr. Khayrat
coz you caught the thief
- But I already took from the prisoner
- What?
I mean I took the
prisoner, I caught the thief
And I can't take it guys,
I'm only doing my job
Take it Zaki, it's a simple
sum, consider it a motive
I don't know what to say,
holy shit... this is a whole lot of money
You don't know how
much I needed this money
I have a big sister who's
about to get married
And my mom's an
old lady and can't work
- Your mom?
- Yeah my mom, what is it?
What about your
dad? He's paralyzed?
- My dad's a good for nothing, you see
- Your dad?
He's a drunkard, he gets home
at dawn every day totally wasted
- Your dad?
- What is it Salem? You know his dad?
No sir, I don't know him,
it's making me go nuts
But I can totally see from what he's
saying that his dad is a scoundrel, right?
Uncle Salem, please, I can't
let anybody insult my father
- That's okay Zaki, you may leave now
- Fine sir, thank you for this generous money
See you later uncle Salem
See you later, see you later, okay?
I love you, I love you so
Excuse me Mr. Khayrat, I wanna go to
the bathroom coz I can't hold it anymore
If I waited some more,
I might dirty the whole place
Excuse me
- You little rascal
- Let me explain
- You wanna explain to me? I'll kill you
- I can give you 100 pounds
- If you're nuts, I'm much more insane
- You can take it all
take the money,
I'll show you, I'm gonna kill you
- Mr. Khayrat, Mr. Khayrat
- Shut your mouth
Come and take this, come
here I'm telling you, take this
When will this water
melon deliver the baby?
You're talking to me dad?
Yeah, since when has
your wife been pregnant?
- Dad's asking since when you're pregnant?
- I'm not counting them, Gimy
It seems to me you're
way over 1 1 months
Take her to a doctor to
see what's wrong with her
Yes dad
- Good evening
- Welcome
Dad Zaki's home, kids
The one who's providing for you
You bought your
sister's trousseau, Zaki?
Or are these the red wine
bottles for your drunkard father
who spends his nights in bars?
- You're done?
- No, I'm not done yet
I'd like to know where is your
old mom who can't work?
Mom? Mom's dead,
don't you remember dad?
She's dead now
And earlier in the day, you were making
up stories to that man, you insolent boy
That's okay dad, that's okay
- It's the same old song every once in a while
- Shame on you, shame on you
I brought you some nice stuff,
a lot of things, whatever you need
Here are the stuff you wrote down
a list about on the fridge, Hussniya
See? I have a good memory
- And look at this dad, it's for you
- What's this? who's this for?
No, it's not for you,
you're too old to pee in this
- What did you brought me Zaki?
- Zaki is over there, concentrate
Look at this one Gimy, look, look
See, I know what you
need, it's for your boy
It's nice, right?
- And dad I brought you one nice quince
- How nice
Of all the fruits available,
you only brought me an apple
Forget about it,
I brought you something else
I thought it's some kind of a cracker,
but they told it's called Kiki
- Kiki?
- Yeah
- It's Kiwi
- Kiwi?
- It's Kiwi, you ignorant boy
- Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
Look what I brought you too
Some dark colored sun glasses
- Here you go
- I don't want them
- Take it, come on
- I said, I don't want anything from you
You look a bit shy, that's okay
Come on now, just
leave it, just leave it
- Take the case
- Leave it, leave it
Allow me to offer you this
small light as a humble gift
What? What would I do with it?
- You can use it instead of matches
- I don't smoke
Really? and to whom is that pack
of cigarettes under your balcony?
- It must be to uncle Hassanein the driver
- Hassanein the driver?
And does Mr. Hassanein
use a lipstick as well?
Listen Zaki
- What's this?
- Leave, I'm not going out today
- Should I leave?
- Yeah
Fine, I sent you message
on Molody yesterday
- You read it?
- What's a Molody?
It's the TV station
you're watching, isn't it?
- Leave, leave
- Okay
Beat it
If you don't pay for
the coffee you drank
If you don't wash all
the clothes you dirtied
You're gonna...
- Omar, good morning
- Good morning
- You're his sister?
- No, I'm Sara, his sister's friend
Well I haven't seen you before,
Omar, close your eyes
Open them
How great, it's magnificent,
it looks just like Titus
See? I didn't find you a totally
new one so I got you a used one
But it's not been used a lot, it spends
the whole time eating and sitting down
Menda, Menda
I told her to fix me a cup of
Nescafe and she hasn't brought it yet
What are you gonna call it, Omar?
- I'll call him Zaki
- Zaki?
It's a very nice name, an original one
Let me go get him something to eat
Hold him down or else he might fly away
Excuse me
- Hi Shereen
- Hi daddy, how are you?
- Who are talking to?
- Wrong number, nobody answered
- What brought you home early?
- What's this repelling smell of cigarettes?
Hi Zaki, how are you doing?
I'm gonna get changed
and will be right down
Tell uncle Hassanein to
come quickly and have lunch
How is uncle Hassanein?
Since you can't take cigarettes,
why do you smoke?
- By the way, it's not my pack
- Then why did you take it if it's not yours?
- Fine, Mr. Khayrat
- Why do you like to cause a scandal?
Admit it, it's a good thing
to admit you're wrong
And what's this common
light? Mine was a lot nicer
- Anyway, thanks
- Fine
Mr. Khayrat
What are we gonna do, Zaki?
- You're talking to me or to your dog?
- I'm talking to you
- You're gonna do something
- Oh no man
No man? Stay like this, stay a coward
What are you scared of? I don't get it
What are you scared of?
What would happen?
Look Omar, I want you to
be brave, be a brave man
Just like a lion, like a roaring lion
You must tell him very
frankly, dad I have a dog
A dog? You brought another
dog to the house, Omar?
I thought we'd agreed about this issue
It's my fault, I let you
do whatever you want
Why did you tell him?
Daddy
That's enough, you nearly
got us in a terrible mess
I told you your dad will get so
mad and you wouldn't believe me
I told him your dad will be angry
and upset coz he hates dogs
He insisted on convincing you
and said things about being a brave
man, a lion and stuff like that
- Who brought this dog? Shereen?
- Yes, Shereen bought it
But this is not the point sir, the main
problem now is having a dog in the house
- This dog must leave right now
- Don't you worry, I'll deal with it
Give me the dog, go
to your room right now
You're happy now?
Why are you angry?
Who'd get disturbed by a small dog,
sir? It's a normal creature to live with
What's to be disturbed of? Look sir,
who'd be upset of such a creature?
It's like a burnt sponge
I have enough worried,
I don't need you too
Mr. Khayrat, it doesn't get any bigger,
it's not gonna take a large space
Look, he walks,
can you see him walk?
- Take it off the carpet
- Don't you worry, he won't pee now
He just peed on the carpet upstairs
Zaki, Omar was very attached
to the old dog he had
- He was very disturbed when he died
- You mean when he got killed
- Anyway, I'll send it back
- So you brought him?
Yes I brought him but I'll send it back
Mr. Khayrat, all I care about is Omar
he must be bursting into
tears in his room right now
What's the big deal in
having such a small dog?
- It's better than becoming a drug addict
- What the hell are you talking about, man?
Oh yeah, anybody of any
age could become a drug addict
It may occur at any time
I'll send it back
Poor little Omar
- Zaki
- Yes
Couldn't you find him
one of a different color?
Yeah, there is a brown one
Okay, I won't object but on one condition
The dog remains in the garden,
I don't wanna see it inside the house
- Is that clear?
- It's clear, it's clear Mr. Khayrat
May you have more and more suits
May this cigar you're
smoking be finished one day
Omar, Omar, dad agreed
to let you keep the dog
He's gonna also let you
keep it in your room
I talked him into it
Good morning
What? What? What?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I spent the night here
I wanted to keep an eye on you
so that you wouldn't get off again
Go ahead
That is a free spot, Zaki
Get down quick and stand
there to park my car, go on
Why don't you park it inside?
The club parking must
be jammed right now
Go on before somebody
else parks in there
Okay, okay, one second, easy
- Get back nice and easy
- You may park there
You shouldn't have done that,
you're mistreating him all the time
- Miss Shereen, Miss Shereen
- Where to sir?
I'm with that miss who just
passed by, Miss Shereen
Be it Miss Shereen, or even
Miss Teen, you can't go in
- Miss Shereen or Miss what?
- Miss Shereen or Miss Teen
You liked it
- It's a very funny one
- Thank you
I say it to her every day but never once
did she laugh, nobody hears it and laughs
Come here every day to tell
you this joke and hear you laugh
- Okay, I will
- It's so nice of you
Thank you, thank you,
what's your name?
- Abdeen
- Neither Mr. Abdeen nor Mr. Teen too?
- That's a new one
- You're so funny man
- Thank you
- You're welcome
Listen Abdeen, she went in there,
should I follow her to the left?
No, you won't go to the left, you'll
go to the right and leave right away
Go on, beat it, go on
Get out of here
I'm dying to see this Zaki
you're always talking about
- Why didn't you bring him with you?
- He did come
- Where is he?
- I left him on the club gate
- He'll learn not to ever challenge me
- You shouldn't have done that
You're all hunting me down
just because I jumped off the wall
It's not like I've jumped
off the Israeli frontiers
I give up
I swear I give up
Long live Egypt
- This is Zaki
- Zaki? Zaki who?
What have you done you stupid fool?
- You got in and left me out
- So you'd jump off the wall?
I'd jump off the High Dike too?
I'm responsible of you
- Let's take him to the hospital, guys
- No, no
- I'm so sorry Zaki
- Never ever say you're sorry
Get up on your feet man,
don't play the white dove now
Who's this teddy bear?
Help me, yeah, nice and easy
That's okay, I'm fine now, I'm fine
- You're gonna live?
- Yeah, just let go of me
What is it Ziko?
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah it hurts
- And now?
- Yeah it still hurts a lot
- It seems that I've lost a lot of blood
- It's okay
If my arm wasn't so
wide and muscular
I tightened it so that the bullet
merely scratched the side
- Or else it would have hit me in the head
- Yeah I noticed
- Look I'll put some micro-chrome on it
- No, no micro-chrome, I don't like it
- Why not?
- It tastes so badly
- Why? You're gonna drink it?
- Ain't it a mixture?
Man, you got me
worried for a second
She's worried about me,
she's worried about me
Come here, come here
What's this?
But still, you didn't tell me,
what shouldn't I wear tonight?
- Should I wear a suit?
- What suit?
We're gonna dance,
just something casual
Casual? I barely have time
to take you home and go get prepared
- Get prepared for what?
- For what?
You think it's so simple
to wear casual clothes
I must be dressed up,
I want you to be proud of me
- Get up
- What are you talking about?
What's this? What's this?
He's so cool
- What the hell is this man?
- What?
- What the hell have you done to yourself?
- Spiky? It's the spiky look
The spiky look?
- What have you done to your hair?
- I gelled it, I mean I've put some gel on it
Coz it's going into my eye
- Why are those guys applauding?
- It's a karaoke
By the way, it's not such a cool place
If I knew we're coming here, I wouldn't
have bothered to make this spiky look
- It's not such a cool place?
- Yep
- Fine, Mr. Spiky, excuse me for a second?
- Go on
Don't let the karaoke man bite
Do they serve tea with milk?
- Hey
- What man?
- Look, do you have any music rhythm?
- You want an Arabic or English tune
Anything, even Japanese
I want him to sing this song
for the first and last time
- I have the right tune for you
- Right man
- See that guy over there?
- Yeah
I want you to give him the mike
Tell me what's his name
and I'll get him for you
- His name is Zaki
- Okay
Great
There are some nice things in here
Let's have a big hand for Zaki who's
gonna sing us the coolest song ever
Ziko, wow
Go on man
Do you know how to play, ''get up
at night, get up in the morning''?
No?
I get up at night, no I get up in the morning,
I get up at night, no I get up in the morning
I get up at night, no I get up in the morning,
I get up at night, no I get up in the morning
I get up at night, no I get up at night, no
I get up at night, no I get up at night no
Let me hear it everybody
One, two, three, yeah, two
Let me hear it, come on
everybody, let me hear it
You saw that hair gelled guy who's
always hanging around in night clubs?
You saw him? You saw him?
You saw the girl with that hair gelled guy
who's always hanging around in night clubs?
I saw her, you saw the dude with
the girl sitting with that hair gelled guy
who's always hanging
around in night clubs?
It's a great night club
You saw the friend of the girl
sitting with that hair gelled guy
who's always hanging
around in night clubs?
Hello everybody I'm different
You saw the girl sitting
with that hair gelled guy
who's always hanging
around in night clubs?
What the hell is he saying?
You saw that guy next to her,
who came around here
With the girl sitting with that hair gelled guy
who's always hanging around in night clubs?
Oh yeah
So great
I get up at night, oh no
So great
It's so extraordinary,
so extraordinary
The gel is complaining about my hair
And my hair is complaining about the gel
My boots are very tight
coz I've tied it so hard
My pants is too loose
It's way under my waist
If I leave him for a minute
It might fall down on me and run away
Oh yeah
Yeah
I'm not just jabbering and chattering
Coz guys, I'm a fine fellow
This is going out of hand
It's just an emergency
and it'll soon be over
I get up at night, oh no
- Thank you
- Ziko, Ziko...
He said to him... he said to him
Ziko
- Holy shit, what have you done?
- Take some
- Come over here, I wanna talk to you
- It's okay, it's okay
Come, I wanna talk to you, come on
So you wanna go the
Sharam El Sheikh trip?
Yes
And if I get this right, you want me
to talk your dad into letting you go
- Yes
- And Sharam El Sheikh is a country?
- Yeah it is, of course
- It's a country
ls this the same Sharam
El Sheikh in Gardakah?
Gardakah?
- They are in two different counties
- Fine, fine
One last question
When was the last time
you went on such a trip?
- 2 years ago
- 2 years ago
- At what time exactly?
- What are these silly questions?
Can you sit still coz
you gave me a headache
You're right, I'm a bit dizzy myself
But I won't sit on this
couch coz I'm scared of it
It looks like a kiss,
I'd better sit over there
Why do you feel that your dad
might not let you go to that trip?
I don't know
Dad's been terrible
with us for a while now
He treats me just like Omar
He treats me like a little baby,
he can't seem to realize I've grown up
Ziko?
Zaki?
What the hell?
You're sleeping? Get up
- Yep, yep
- Yep?
What's this? I had a terrible dream
I saw everybody in white
outfits and going toward the sea
It's clear they were
going to Sharam El Sheikh
- That must be us
- Give me just five minutes to get some rest
Then I'll go have a
word with Mr. Khayrat
What's this? Get up
Hello
Listen
I want you to take the foreign experts for a 3
day ride at Luxor, until I give you my answer
We're going to Sharam El Sheikh,
you wanna come with us?
What's wrong with you?
- What Ziko? Dad agreed?
- He's such an obstinate man
- Frankly
- What?
- I tried but...
- He said no, I knew it
- I really did my best, he's...
- That's okay, just leave me alone
- You won't be scared all alone?
- Move it man
By the way, you
really can't be trusted
Anyway, let me tell you
that your dad has agreed
- Oh no
- Oh yes
- Oh no, no, no
- Yep
- No, you're kidding
- I'm not kidding
- No, you're kidding
- I swear he's agreed
- Really?
- Yeah, he agreed
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I swear
- I'm so fond of you
- What?
- I really am, thanks a lot, thank you
- No problem
Thank you, I can't believe it
I'm so fond of you
Ziko, sorry I... he's gone
- Hi
- Hi
- Hi
- No
I was absolutely sure
you were gonna say no
You're just rubbish, nobody would
wanna look at you not even a jellyfish
- Look
- What?
Why don't we go for a little walk?
- Okay, let's go
- Come on
- Where to?
- We're going for a little walk
- You have any problem with that?
- No, not at all, let's go
Let's go for a walk,
come on Sara, come on Omar
Come on, come on
- Where are Omar and Zaki?
- Don't you worry, they'll be here soon
Let's have a seat, come on
It seems to me we're lost, Omar
Stop right there
Yeah
- Who are they?
- They're brigands
look Omar, I want
you to do exactly like I do
Raise your hands,
I told you to do exactly like I do
Those people are leading
the most peaceful life
In the midst of the desert, and the mountains,
dancing and having a hell of a time
What else caught your attention?
- Something else? Like what?
- Nothing, it's nothing at all
Look I'll go bring some food,
you want to eat something?
- No I don't want to eat
- Fine, stay here, I'll be right back
You can have it all in here
We have motorcycles,
camels and even thieves
What will happen now?
We'll fall down on our faces
How nice
We're here
Get down Omar
Thank you so much,
where have you gone?
Thank you so much, you're so nice
I don't know how we'd be
back if it weren't for your help
Thank you so much, give something to
eat for this camel coz he seems exhausted
- Good evening
- What's this? What are you wearing?
Omar insisted that we get changed
into this traditional costume
To blend perfectly
with the mountains
- Ain't it right, chief?
- What took you so long? I got so worried
Why? It's such a safe place,
nothing to worry about
It's the first time
I see you in a dress
By the way, black
suits you perfectly
- Thank you Zaki
- I adore dark colors
What's this? It's the first
time I see you drink tea
What's this man? You
really are such a saucy man
- It's my cup of tea
- No it's mine
- What? Whose cup of tea is it?
- It's for Hazem
See? I told you, you've got tea and food
- You want them both?
- No
- Then give me the food platter
- Here you go
It's the chicken breast,
I prefer the haunch
- Give it to me
- There you go
You can sit on the floor
Hello there, how are you doing?
how is everything?
How are things going around here?
How are the mountains, the soil?
Why don't you answer me?
What's this lamb? Is it awake?
You're still not answering
You're broiling it or torturing it?
Don't you talk around
here in the desert?
It's fine, it's fine, when
it's fully grilled, give me some
By the way Shereen, I must go
back to Egypt today, it's urgent
- Why? What's wrong?
- Nothing serious, don't get so jumpy
It's just that I got the safe key
and dad needs something from it
Why don't you send it by Super jet?
It's the safe key, how
can I send it by Super jet?
Fine Hazem, leave,
what can I do for you?
Why do you get mad
so easily over anything?
It's okay, I'll be back in no time,
okay? I'd better go now
What's wrong? Hazem didn't
notice you're wearing a new dress?
No, he liked it very much
And he said it's the first time
I see you wearing a dress
And said that black
suits me perfectly
Shereen
You're still awake? I thought
you'd be sound asleep by now
- Where to?
- I just felt a bit stifled
- And wanted to go for a little walk
- I'm not feeling okay myself
- Can I come with you?
- Security measures too?
No, no, I just feel stifled too
It's obvious that the room
is newly been painted
The walls smell like oil painting
Let's go
Just a second, I'd
better bring my jacket
- Coz it might get hot all of a sudden
- Okay
Just give me a second
I'm ready, would you like
to go to the right or to the left?
- Let's go to the right
- Okay, go on, go on
You seem cold, do you
want to have my jacket?
On the contrary,
it's such a cool weather
It's okay
- What were you listening to?
- Arabic or English?
Arabic or English,
what were just listening to?
- You were making a commotion in the room
- Oh yeah, a while ago
- It's a song by Omar and Diab
- Omar and Diab?
- What singers do you like to?
- I like Mohamed and Fouad too
- Really?
- Yeah
- Why don't you sing something for me?
- You want me to sing you a song?
- Yeah
- No I can't
- Come on, do it for me
- I can't sing
- You'd rather make me sad?
- I don't wanna make you sad
- But I have a very bad voice
- Then you must be shy
- No I'm not shy but I can't sing
- Do it for me
- No
- Come on, come on
- I can't
- I'm down in the dumps, do it for me
It's just a song I used
to listen to as a child
It says, if only, if only
- I can't do it
- Go on, go ahead
It's... if only, if only I have a
choice, if only I had the power
I'd buy you... an island
Why are you moving like this?
See I told you,
I have a very bad voice
But there's this song I like very
much, it's by Samir and Sabri
- Really?
- Yeah, it goes like this
It's beautiful, it's such a
beautiful world, so beautiful
There's something
I used to do as a child
Please I beg you, don't tell me it's
like the dance you did a while ago
You said you like it
Look, up high in the sky
And hear the sound of the
sea at the exact same time
- At the exact same time
- Exactly
- Do you feel anything?
- No
Well that's my problem too,
as a child I never felt anything
So I thought you'd
better try it, maybe...
What's this?
I felt something
What's this?
I... I wanna tell you
something but I'm a hesitating
Go ahead, say it
You know that you've
got 4 different laughs
How come?
You have one laugh when
you're awake in the morning
You have a different one
but don't me mad at me
No I won't
- When you lie
- I'm a liar?
We're all liars
Like when you lied to me about
getting the mobile from your room
You gave me a similar laugh
- What else?
- There's the 3rd laugh, it's a scornful laugh
- Scornful?
- Not so scornful, it's in between
- I mean, a laugh which is a bit sarcastic
- What's this?
- I'm slipping up, right?
- Yeah, you're slipping up
Not sarcastic, I mean it's
filled with hatred or rancor
- Look, forget about this laugh
- Okay
- It's the 3rd laugh, what about the 4th one
- The 4th one is...
Why don't you do it for me?
When you laugh like this,
your eyes are closed like this
- I laugh like this?
- Yeah you laugh like this
By the way, this is the 4th laugh
when I do something you like
and you start laughing out loud
Then there must be a missing laugh
It must have missed this one out
I'd be a liar if I said I knew it
- We'd better get out of this hole
- Why? We're sitting here comfortably
Besides, it's not such a deep hole
Let's stay here, somebody
might come and serve us here
You're cold, you want my jacket?
I told you a thousand
times the weather is fine
I find too hot
- Can I ask you something?
- I'm not engaged
Engaged?
If the question is engaged to
the answer, they might get married
- I'm talking seriously, am I a reckless girl?
- What do you mean? I don't get it
Considering that my dad is always worried
about me and criticizing whatever I do
Do you find it wrong that
your dad is worried about you?
- No, of course not
- Then he must worry about you
As for what you do, if you
wouldn't act so recklessly
your father wouldn't
be worried all the time
- Right?
- Right
You'd better take my jacket now
- I spoke a lot
- I feel I gave you a headache
On the contrary,
I'm feeling much better now
- Here you go
- Keep it, keep it, what are you doing?
- Take it
- Keep it, you might catch a cold
Thank you so much
By the way, you're
such a kind-hearted guy
Thank you
- Good night
- Good night
I was rehearsing the song,
''it's a beautiful world''
Sign right here, coz it's a formal
approval of the new perfumes
You agreed upon that contract and
you have my authorization, sign it yourself
By the way, I miss the
kids very much, Salem
May the lord keep
them healthy and strong
Since you mentioned it, I have
a small confession to make
- What is it Salem?
- It's nothing serious
I just made a white
lie, Zaki is my son
- Zaki is your son?
- Yes sir
But it's not my fault, I mean
I got implicated in the beginning
I feared he might get me into trouble
like he does in every job he takes
By the way, Zaki told me he's
your son since the first day of work
He asked me not to tell
you coz you would refuse
Since you don't like take
advantage of your position here
Zaki told you?
- Zaki, you...
- No, don't you insult him, I'll be mad at you
If only my son would grow up
to become like your son Zaki
I wanna buy something from this shop
I'll ask for some dog food
over there, I hope to find some
- I've always adored Russians
- Hazem, Hazem
Hey Hazem, Hazem
You hooked the chick?
I didn't want her in the first place
I'm not from here
I'm not from Sharam,
don't you understand English?
I'm not from Sharam
I'm not from here
Toofley? Look man, knock it
off right now, don't you bother me
I'm not from Sharam,
I'm not from here
Sorry, sorry
Insult me as you please, that's what
you've been taught at home, to insult others?
Sorry, sorry?
Hello, yes honey
How are you? I missed you
I missed you too
No, no, no, I won't be late
I still have some work to do
here and I'll be right back
- Take care, drive safely
- Okay honey, don't you worry, bye
What's this? There's Shereen
- By the way, you're all rascals
- Why?
- You went out and left me alone
- I tried to wake you up but to no avail
You're still a rascal
- What is it Omar?
- I'm sad
- Why?
- We couldn't find any dog food
That's why he's so sad
Don't you worry, I'll ask
Hazem to get you some
He won't find any, I told you we've
looked all over the market place
- He'll bring some from Egypt
- Is Hazem going back to Egypt?
- He's in Egypt right now
- How come? When did he leave?
Yesterday late at night
How come? I just saw
him at the market place
No, no, no, you must have
mistaken him for somebody else
Maybe, it could be
someone who looks like him
- You saw Hazem in the market place?
- No
Hazem and Sara were...
- He's not answering?
- Maybe the phone needs to be recharged
- Or maybe the battery is dead
- What?
Yeah, yeah, it's possible
I'll go give him a beating and let
him say again that he saw me here
- Listen, I don't want any troubles
- You think I'm a liar and he's saying the truth
He's a vicious guy,
he just wants us to fight
He doesn't know about us,
he thinks we're just friends
Then he wants to gain favor with your dad
and he knows your dad doesn't like me
- Zaki doesn't say anything to dad
- Listen, it seems to me he's hitting on you
- And he's jealous of me
- What the hell are you saying?
- Of course not
- You didn't notice the way he looked at you
- Then why was your phone off?
- Listen I'm going back to Egypt
No, no, no, I'm so sorry,
I won't do it again, Hazem
Hey Hazem
Stop biting my shoe,
tell him to back off Omar, tell him
You
- You're looking for us, right?
- You really saw Hazem here?
- Yeah I saw him while we were...
- Liar
Can you calm down and
tell me what happened?
Are you out of your mind?
You're trying to hold my hand?
- I didn't mean to but...
- You're a liar
No I'm no liar
If you don't wanna believe
he's lying, suit yourself
- Show some respect
- What's going on Shereen?
Shereen? You're hired to work
for us, you forgot who you are?
No, I didn't forget who I am at all
I'm sorry if I crossed the line,
I'm sorry if I held your hand
But I'm no liar
Zaki, Zaki
Omar, come here
I gave him a hell of a scolding
- Then come on in
- No, I'd better go
Where are you going? Come on
in and talk to him from my place
Come on in, get in
- Aren't we going out?
- I'm gonna get changed
- Hello
- Yeah girl, you're not going out with us?
No I can't, I'd rather
stay here, fine bye
Come on Shereen,
why don't you calm down?
How can we go out
and you're like this?
- That's okay, it's nothing
- Calm down, okay?
- What the hell?
- What? What is it?
- Why don't you ease it up a bit?
- Ease up?
Do anything, come with me to
the bathroom while I'm shaving
Hazem I told you a thousand times
I hate it when you hit on me like this
- I'm going out
- It's just that I can't take such a beauty
- What's this?
- Shereen
Listen to me
Why are you doing this? Why are you
doing this? You're out of your mind?
You're leaving?
Knock it off Hazem
- Zaki, help me Zaki
- Help her Zaki, Shereen is screaming
That's enough
Hazem, that's enough
Wait here and don't you move
Cut it out, shame on you,
stop it, wake up, wake up
Zaki
What are you waiting for? Leave
Your dream has tumbled down
Wake up, forget
about her and move it
Close down the way to your heart
It's been hurt enough already
They made you build
castles in the sand
From now on, your
dreams are no longer happy
I beg you, stop dreaming
Stop dreaming
Stop dreaming
How's Zaki doing, Salem?
He's sad and for a big
reason too, that's obvious
I've never seen my
son silent for that long
Tell him I hold him in high esteem
Tell him I'm waiting for him
Not as Zaki the bodyguard,
but as Zaki Salem El Asyuty
- I don't understand
- Just tell him that, and he'll get it
You're still awake, Zaki and
you're still pulling that long face?
By the way son, I don't wanna
know what's troubling you
I just wanna tell you
something that might help you
When your mother died, I felt
like my life came to an ending
I felt sad, extremely sad
I wanted to die after her
But... here I am
standing by your side
I'm not dead and life went on
By the way, Mr. Khayrat
told me you're a brave man
And he wants you back to work
Dear Lord, is it that bad?
Anyway, let me give
you a piece of advice
Don't let grief overtake you and force
you somewhere you'd regret later on
Good night dear
Zaki, why don't you go
deal with that customer?
- I have an order to deliver
- Let me handle this
- Go deal with that customer
- Why don't you do it yourself?
- Give it me, go now
- This is the check of table 5
Good evening
How are you doing Zaki?
What would you like to have?
- You're still angry with me, Zaki?
- You still haven't ordered, Ma'am
- I... I wanna have a cup of tea
- Tea?
Okay
- Why are you crying now?
- Coz I hate tea
Yeah I know, I know you hate tea
And it's the first time I see you cry
That's okay, I won't get
you a cup of tea, I won't
You know something?
This is the fifth laugh
you asked me about
Stop crying, stop, I don't
have any handkerchief
So dry your tears
with the tablecloth
This end is soaked
wet, take the other one
- Let's go Zaki
- Yeah but...
There's something
important I have to do first
