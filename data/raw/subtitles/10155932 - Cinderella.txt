Once upon a time...
...there was
an old-fashioned kingdom
bound by tradition.
Here, everyone had
a part to play,
and they played it
without question.
Little did they know,
their world was about to change.

Stepmother?
Imagine if you served such swill

How long would it take
for him to abandon you?
To understand
just how worthless you are?
Learn from this
and never do it again.
I thought she was
rather hard on her.
- I thought she could've gone harder.
- Quiet.
Cinderella, now that
you're an orphan,
it's important for you

Yes, of course. And that's why

No, but chicks dig it.

Parsnips, turnips, rutabagas.

No, no, not today. Yeah, I just

LAURA:
Doing what?
You spent three whole days
drinking and foxhunting.
That was a lot of hard work.
Now, you try tracking a fox

The changing of the guard
waits for no one.
Cinderella?
Yeah?
Do you think I look pretty?
I think you look so pretty.
But...
honestly, who cares
what I think?
Who cares what anyone thinks?
What matters is how you feel
when you look in the mirror.
That's deep.
How do I feel...
about myself?
Uh...
Yeah, I do.
I feel pretty.
Cool.
You have dirt on your face.
(Malvolia laughing)
Please, girls,
we're going to be late.
What is that?
It's a dress.
I made it.
- Why?
- I don't know.
I-I just thought,
since the whole kingdom
will be there today,
I could find someone
who will maybe buy it.
(laughter)
To think that any girl,
let alone you,
would have the audacity
to engage
in matters of business,
it's insane.
I will not have you
embarrassing this household
with your blasphemy.
Don't ever let me catch you
trying such nonsense again.
Put the dress down.
Yes, Stepmother.
Good.
Now... shoulders back.
- (grunts)
- No slouching.
And smile.
Every girl is worth more
when she smiles.
(sighs)
(door closes)
What are you doing?
I am stewing in my own anger.
(softly):
Oh, okay.
You turned down the daughter
of Lord Reginald.
I guess she wasn't the one.
She was!
I would've had control
of all the territories
right up to the domain
of the sea monster.
Well, perhaps you should marry
the sea monster, Robert.
I would have to have
grandmother's ring resized.
(laughs)
You keep overlooking
his behavior,
- and he'll never grow out of it.
- Stop.
He's gonna make a fine king.
Is it me,
or is your throne
just a little bit taller
- than it was yesterday?
- (sputtering sigh)
- I mean, it really looks...
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
- Quite a bit.
- And even if it is,
I have every right
to make it taller.
I'm king.
Mm. Yes.
And I am ridiculous.
If you need me,
I shall be in my chambers.
Brushing my hair.
Until it all falls out.
So we good?
'Cause I got a thing.
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
You're bringing shame
on this family, Robert.
Have you seen this?
ROBERT: "The Roundabout Players
present The King's Idiot Son."
(chuckles): Ooh, do you think
we can still get tickets?
I'm becoming a laughingstock.
I think you're overreacting.
Well, why don't you ask
the Roundabout Players
if I'm overreacting?
They are currently
in a dark windowless room
under the castle.
You can't leave actors alone
in a basement without attention.
They'll die!
When you marry,
you'll settle down.
You'll stop behaving
like my idiot son,
and the perception
of the people will be
that you take the crown
seriously.
- You can't control me.
- (choir singing in distance)
Oh, that's exactly
what I can do.
That's the perk
of being the king.
But I feel nothing
for these women.
It's crazy to think
I'm actually gonna
fall in love with one of them.
Kings marry for power,
- not for love.
- (choir continues singing)
Oh, well, it's perfect then
that Mother came with
three castles
and a hundred horses,
or I suppose
I never would've been born!
- Silence!
- (choir gasps)
Don't talk about
what you don't understand. Hmm?
Continue to defy me,
and just out of spite,
I'll give it all... the crown,
the palace,
everything... to your sister.
CHOIR:

Leave us, Gwen.
Sorry.
I would be embarrassed
if I wasn't so bored

But since I'm here,
I would love to stay

You've been excused, Gwen.
Right.
But would this be a good time
for me to mention
how the kingdom could use
the power of the wind
- instead of burning filthy coal?
- Go!
Father, you know how badly
I want to be king.
I do. (chuckles softly)
Now, to make sure your nuptials
are done properly and on my
schedule, we shall hold a ball.

- No.
♪ Balls are fun ♪
Yes. We'll invite
every woman of worth.
You'll dance.
You'll be charming.
You shall find a bride.
- Hmm?
- No, no, no.
D-Dancing at these things
is so... mannered.
And formal.
We look like fools!
Of course we do.
But women love it.
Good God, Robert,
if a rich man ever lost a woman,
it was to a man who could dance.
Why do I have to explain
everything to you?
This is insane!
I can't just pick
some bride at a ball.
And then what?
(laughs): We're-we're supposed
to grow old together?
Into our 40s?
I mean, what are we even
gonna talk about?
You will go to the ball.
You will find someone.
That's an order.
Now, go dress.
I expect you to look sharp for
the changing of the guard. Hmm?

- Lovely day for a stroll.
- Mm-hmm.
I just adore your headpiece.
You know, it'd go beautifully
with this dress I made.
- I can give you a fair price.
- Shame on you.
Trying to sell me a dress
you clearly stole
from the lady you serve.
No, I-I stitched this
with my own two hands.
I should alert the king's guard
and have you arrested,
you street urchin.
Arrest...?
Okay.
CINDERELLA:
Ladies and gentlemen!
For a mere
five pieces of silver,
who would like to purchase
this one-of-a-kind,
completely non-stolen dress?
Here's a laugh.
This girl fancies herself
a businessman.
(laughter)
Don't-Don't listen to him.
This is a one-of-a-kind design.
I'd stop while
you're ahead, missy.
- Who on earth do you think you are?
- Honestly.
But...
Sounds like you need
to lower your price.
(sighs)
Sir, please don't pile on, okay?
Not today.
No, no, I'm sorry.
It's a beautiful dress.
Right?
I should be allowed to sell it.
Sure, but women can't own shops.
- Uh-huh. And that's unfair.
- Is it?
Yes!
Us ladies give birth.
We run households.
Surely we can run a business.
Can't be that hard.
I mean,
wouldn't it just be great
if I could have my own shop?
Right here.
I could hang my garments
on that side.
And I'd say things like,
"Thank you. Come again."
Or, "Hot enough
out there for ya?"
What?
It's banter.
It breaks the ice.
Okay. What am I doing?
I'm going home.
- I'm talking to a stranger.
- I'll take it.
Take what?
The dress. I'll buy it.
Is this pity?
Are you doing this
'cause you feel sorry for me?
- Because that's really nice, but...
- No.
I'm just trying to do my part
to correct a flawed system.
What's your price?
I mean, the brooch alone...
Oh, the brooch.
That was my mother's.
I never knew her,
but I want to believe
she'd rather me have my dreams
than her brooch, so...
I'll pay triple
what you're asking.
You?
Don't judge a book
by its cover, milady.

(laughs)
Prince Robert needs a ball
to find his bride.
(laughs):
What is wrong with him?
Maybe nothing's wrong with him.
I heard he just wants to allow
anyone the chance
to fall in love with him.
How conceited is that?
Rumors must be true.
What, pray tell, are the rumors?
You know, that he serves
no real function
other than to wreck things.
That the real brains
of the family is Princess Gwen.
Duh.
Oh, and that he's a mama's boy
who I heard, from time to time,
still gets spanked
on the tush-tush.
- Not true at all, though.
- Ah, maybe.
Sounds like a vicious lie to me.
So does this mean
you're not coming to the ball?
No way.
I mean, the whole thing
is weird and antiquated.
Not my thing.
Nice to meet you.
You know, we live in
a very old-fashioned kingdom,
but the ball, I mean,
there'll be guests there
from all over the world,
open-minded people
with cash to spare.
Now, I know them.
I can introduce you
if you'd like.
Why would you do that?
I mean, you just met me.
Let's just say
I know what it feels like
to not quite fit into the crate
you were born into.
And I... I believe in you.
Then, yes.
I'll go.
(stammers) Huzzah!
What?
(stammers)
I heard a proper person say that
one time when he was excited.
Ah, look who's been around
a proper person.
Just once.
I once shared an apple
with a goat named King Rowan.
Well, I'm sure the prince
will definitely pick you.
I doubt it. I'm dirty.
I smell like a basement.
My best friends are mice.
It's a whole thing.
I-I will just find you
at the ball.
Thank you for this.
You're welcome.
Hope the dress fits!
(chuckles) Gonna try it on
as soon as I get home.
Okay. (chuckles)
He's kind of cute.

Yes!

All right, turn around.
Let me see.
Oh, my.
After tonight, one of you may
very well become a princess.
- (Malvolia chuckles)
- You really think so?
I do.
And after all the bad things
that have happened in our lives,
wouldn't it be nice
if we had something good?
(approaching footsteps)
It's over. I'm eating a muffin
and going to bed.
No.
Did you make that dress?
Mm-hmm.
I suppose it's nice.
It's tasteful.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, I should have said
something earlier,
but, Cinderella, you don't need
to go to the ball.
What do you mean?
Of course I do.
No, it's for girls
who are unbetrothed,
and as of this morning,
you are spoken for.
That's impossible.
I speak for me.
No, Thomas has expressed
his intentions to marry you.
CINDERELLA:
Thomas?
But I don't want
to marry Thomas.
- I reject his intentions.
- Hush now.
Women who are promised away
do not go to balls.
Take off that dress
and go back to your basement.
No, but...
Please, Stepmother,
I have to go.
My future depends on it.
I-I spent weeks making
this dress so that I could
show women from
all over the world that I...
(gasps)
Why would you...?
(whimpers)
Ow.
You are to stay home
and find a way
to be that man's bride.
Upset me further, and you will
have no one in this life.
(gasps, whimpers)
(insects chirping)
Poor Ella.
She was so looking forward
to that ball.
- It's a shame.
- Absolutely devastating.

Uh, guys?
Gosh, that's beautiful.
What an improvement.
Adventure time.
Let's follow it.
Right behind you.

on a full stomach, but okay.

(Vivian grunts)
I'm so sorry.
I don't know
what I was thinking.
No, please, forgive me.
I'm not accustomed to being
among nobility, Your Grace.
Think nothing of it.
Tonight, we are all equals
in the eye of the king.
You're too kind.
My, what lovely shoes.
Yes. (chuckles) They're glass.
-(gasps) -I could walk in them
easily after, like, four steps.
(chuckles softly)
Now, uh, if you'll excuse me,
I was making my way
up to the balcony.
Because the best view
is always from on high.
(whispers):
Oh, my God.
Look at us. We're standing
outside the palace.
W-We're-we're literally
breathing the same air
as the royal family.
Whatever happens after tonight,
I'm a changed mouse.
- Mm-hmm.

(panting)
I just relieved myself,
and you are not gonna believe
how it happens.
Through your front tail.
We know.

- It's like... (imitates explosion)

You should go. Go now.
I would. Not got the urge.

Excuse me, my dear.

ROBERT:
Good evening, ladies.
First, I would like to thank
each and every one of you
for being here.
You are all so beautiful
and have so much to offer.
But if I'm being honest,
there is only one
who has captured my attention.
- (Narissa grunts softly)
- Sadly, I have not
cast my eyes on her tonight.
- (laughing loudly)
- (guests groaning, murmur)
- (sighs) Sorry. Words. Um...
- (Robert talking in distance)
I designed it.
Then I am honored
to be in the presence
of such an artist.
Would it be possible
to see more of your work?
- More than possible.
- Good.
I attend lavish events
around the world,
and I hate all my clothes.
I'm looking for someone
to travel with me
to enliven my wardrobe.
Maybe that person is you.
Me?
We will meet tomorrow
when the clock strikes 4:00.
I have an hour
before I catch my ship home.
Yes, yes. I'll be at the
south end of the market square.
Don't be late.
It's unlikely I'll return here,
and I have no patience
for those who misuse my time.
- Of course.
- After all,
I am a frickin' queen.
(both chuckle)
This is why
you save caterpillars.
ROBERT:
A-And then she suggested
that I was a mama's boy

When I was little,
I remember watching my father
go off to war

brave he looked in his armor.
And I wanted to be
just like him.
And then, as I got older

more about
traditions and customs

...and never asking
what I want or how I feel...
I know exactly what you mean.

Robert, stop.
I don't want a life stuck
waving from a royal box

confined to a basement.

Uh-huh.
Well, you didn't miss much
at the ball.
The prince was fixated
on some mystery girl.
Then she ran away like a twit.
So now he's to marry
Princess Laura of Northphalia
the day after next.
(sighs) Malvolia and Narissa,
they never stood a chance.
And I was so foolish
to believe differently.
A mother just gets carried away.
I know I've been hard on you.
It's not fueled by spite.
I've never shared this
with anyone before, but...
I used to play piano.
Taught myself.
And I was good.
I was really good.
Nothing made me happier.
Then one day,
I was given the opportunity
to train at the finest
school of music,
and I took it.
(chuckles softly)
There I was...
Two children, a loving husband,
and I had the audacity
to want more.
It was just a month... one month.
And yet, when I returned,
my husband, well...
...he believed real wives
didn't act so frivolously.
You may think me cruel.
But the real cruelty would be
for me to allow you to think
that you can be
something you can't.
(gasps)

This shoe.
It was you.
Cinderella.
I don't know how you did
what you did last night,
but the prince chose you.
He loves you.
Marry him, and all of
our problems will be solved.
I can't. I told him
I didn't want to marry him.
Tell him you were wrong.
Tell him... tell him
it's all you want.
If not for yourself,
then-then do it for us.
For your family.
I can help our family,
Stepmother.
I can provide for us.
Don't be so stupid.
Who taught you
to think that way?
Please, Cinderella, don't
throw away this opportunity.
Go back to him.
It's too late.
He's marrying someone else.
It's over.
Fine.
Then I'm taking you to Thomas,
and I'm giving you to him today.
I would rather die.

You're mad

I hate to break it to you,

Please, say something.
You're making me
wildly uncomfortable.
Have you ever wondered
why Robert makes
the process to marry
so difficult?
Because he's a spoiled child
who refuses to grow up. Simple.
I believe it's because of the
example set before him by us.
A marriage without love,
without respect.
Bea, please,
you know I love you.
Saying "love" and showing love
are two very different things,
Rowan.
Before you were king,
I felt your love every day.
You couldn't stand to be away
from me, even for a moment.
Remember, you used to appear
at my window
like a knight in shining armor
and you'd serenade me
with your skull-splitting voice.
We were young.
Things... change.
No. You changed.
The crown changed you.
You're so worried
to look a fool.
So obsessed with your
reputation, with your legacy.
Well, it's only my life's work.
It causes me
a great deal of stress.
Do you think you're the only
person who feels stress?
God, try being your bloody wife.
It is utterly exhausting to sit
next to you and just smile
as if I were nothing more
than a prop,
my voice completely silenced.
I mean, what I wouldn't give
to say, "You're wrong,"
in front of the entire kingdom.
Bea...
you're being unreasonable now.
Well, if you say so.
After all, you're the king.
Can't be any other opinions
other than yours.
Do you know,
there's never a guarantee
with a couple in our position.
But we had love, Rowan.
We had it.
And now...
Robert's wiser than both of us.
(knocking)
Hello.
I'm ready.
You summoned me, Your Highness?
We can't have
a regular conversation
like a normal father and son,
can we?
No, no.
To satisfy your power trip,
you have to sit there
on your slightly too tall
throne.
You-you belittle me in your...
(deep voice):
your-your king voice, yes.
(normal voice):
All because you're so insecure
with your legacy that you
have to control my every move.
Now, I ask you,
does that sound
like a strong leader to you?
ROWAN:
Robert...
I was wrong.
I, King Rowan...
Am I doing the king voice?
A little bit.
You can't help yourself.
Go find the owner
of this glass slipper.
And if she'll take you back,
then marry her.
Or don't.
It's your life, son.
Wh-Why the sudden
change of heart?
Well, definitely
wasn't your mum.
- Go on, leave now.

- Well, that's all right.
It just so happens I share blood
with another who, one day,
will be the greatest leader
the realm has ever known.
Hear that, Gwen?
What's happening?
- Gwen, my darling girl.
- (Beatrice chuckles)
I hereby place you first in line
to inherit the crown, hmm?
Don't stab me in my sleep.
I... shall be king?
Eh, queen.
I'll take it.
Good.
Just so we're clear,
I'm going to rule the land?
- Yes.
- Okay.
And everyone heard that?
- We did. Yes.
- Yes. -Yeah. Mm-hmm.
(chuckles):
Oh!
So many ideas!
Like... Oh, I don't know
where to begin!
Oh, good.
Can I take this crown off?
- Yes.
- Shall we have some tea?
(crowd cheering)
GWEN:
It is my honor
to guide this kingdom forward
into a new era.
And to pay my deepest respects
to my brother,
Prince Robert, and his new...
What are we calling you?
Well...
I mean, we don't have to put
a label on it.
Just... in love?
(mutters):
I don't know.
In love?
Yeah.
In love.
And his new love, Ella!
(cheering and applause)
Ella.
I believe this belongs to you.
My mother's brooch.
I thought it could inspire you
on your voyage.
Thank you.
All right, that's enough mirth.
Celebration's over.
- Everyone, go home.
- (crowd groaning, protesting)
- Oh, man.
- Back to work.
- Come on. Let's go.
- No!
(clears throat)
You're wrong!
- (crowd cheering)

And so we've reached
the end of this fairy tale.
Our girl lived
happily ever after,
and everybody knew her name.
Ella.
The girl's name is Ella, y'all.
