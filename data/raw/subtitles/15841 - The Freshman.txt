HAROLD LIOYD
IN
FRESHMAN
Do you remember those boyhood days
when going to...
...college was greater than going to congress
and you'd rather be Right Tackle than President?
The home of Harold Lamb.
His father was the best
bookkeeper in the county ...
and the worst liar in the state.
"Look, Pa, how much Harold has saved to take ...
...to college for spending money, just by
selling washing machines. "

"He's been upstairs in his room all evening ...
... dreaming about going to college, he simply
can't thinkof anything else. "
College Yells
"Static !"
"I've got China !"
"I guess he learned it at that movie show,
''The College Hero" ...
... he saw it six times yesterday. "

"I saw it in the movies, ...
... the college hero did that jig every time ...
he was introduced to anyone. "
"I took me a week to learn it, Dad ...
but I bet it will make a hit at college !"
"I'm afraid, Ma, if Harold imitates that movie actor ...
at college, they'll break either his heart
or his neck !"
The Opening of the Fall term at Tate University ...
... a large football stadium with a college attached.
The Dean of the College ...
he was so dignified he never married for fear ...
his wife would call him by his first name.
The peril of the Freshman ...
an upper class bully who made Simon Legree  ...
look like the Good Samaritan .
On the Tate Limited. Peggy, ...
the kind of girl your mother most have been.
"Hello, Peggy ... are you still helping
your mother with the boarding house ? "
"Yes ... and I have a new job at the Hotel Tate ...

"I think I know the word
for number 19 vertical ...
... 'a name for the one you love love.' "
"Sweetheart."
"Darling."
"Dearest."
"Precious."
"Honeybunch."
"Isn't it wonderful to
be in love ?"
"Pipe the latest sport-model Freshman with the ...
... old fashioned trimmings, let's ride him !"
"My name's Harold Lamb ...
what's yours ?"
"I am the Dean of this college."
"Have you been assigned a car
to take you to the college ?"
The Tate Auditorium.
The student body was waiting ...
...to be annoyed by the Dean's opening address.
"See that everything is ready ...
the Dean is due any minute. "
TATE AUDITORIUM
STAGE ENTRANCE
"Aren't you going to say a few words
of greeting to the students ?"
"Why, every new student
must make a speech ...
if you don't, you'll be the most
unpopular man in college !"
"My friends, I am here ...er...
yes, there is no doubt but
that I am here ... ... "
"Yes, I repeat that I am here ...
er...you are here...
...in fact, we are all here ."
NOTE FROM THE COLLEGE HERO
"I'M JUST A REGULAR FELLOW ...
...STEP RIGHT UP AND
CALL ME SPEEDY "
"I'm just a regular fellow !"
"... and I want you to step right up
and call me 'Speedy' !"
"Come on... I'll stand treat
for some ice cream !"
A day spent in
spending changed Harold's plans ...
...for living quarters ...
FOR RENT
FURNISHED ROOM
3$ PER WEEK.
"I'll spend my daughter up to finish
washing these windows ...
...while you're out to to dinner ."
"I ...er... took this little room so
I'd have a quiet place ...
to hide away and study ."
As "Speedy" splurged through
the dizzy days,
...even the Tate Tattler ast up...
...and took notice ...
This Frisky Freshman is
Just a Regular Fellow,
...Who is Leaving a Trail of
Empty Ice Cream Cones ...
...on his Dizzy Dash to Popularity.
"You see, you can never be as popular
as Chet Trask ...
...unless you play on the football team ."
Football practice ...
Where men are men
and necks are nothing.
The head coach ...
so tough he shaves with
a blow-torch.
"The boys are getting careless ...
...I'll have to jack 'em up. Get them
together and I'll tear 'em to pieces !"
"What this team needs is
the fighting spirit !...
...You dubs are dead from
your dandruff down !"
"There's the only man on your team ...
...with the real Tate spirit !"
"There's the man to model yourselves
after ! He's worth more than...
...the whole bunch of you
put together !"
"He's a regular go-getter ...
...a red-blooded fighter ...
...the kind of man that
Tate is proud of !"
"You're all afraid of getting hurt !...
...I'd like someone to show me
a real ROUGH tackle !"
"I'd like to play on your football team
if you don't mind."
"Can you kick a football ?"
MIKE
MASCOT
"Get off this field ...
AND DONO'T COME BACK !"
"The boys need tackling practice
more than anything else ...
...we've GOT to have a dummy !"
"This is no Petting party !...
...That's not half hard enough !"
"Never tackle a man this way !
You might get hurt !"
"You see...
that didn't hurt me a bit ."
"And besides, if you tackle high,
they'll get you with the straight arm ...
...now, watch me !"
"You see, that's not
the way to do it ."
"Now, I'll show you the
right way to do it."
"You guys are weaing me out !...
...This team is going to learn to
tackle if it takes all night !"
"We had a great work-out,...
...didn't we, Coach ?"
"That kid's got a great spirit ...
...I hate to tell him he can't make the team. "
"Why not keep him on
the squad as a water boy ...
...and let him think he's
one of the substitutes? "
THE WHITE COMPANY
AMBULANCE
"I've got a new one on Speedy...
...he thinks he made
the football team ...
...and he's only the water boy !"
"Harold Lamb has more spunk
in his little finger than you have in...
...your whole conceited make-up !"
"Harold, I've something to tell you ..."
"I MADE THE TEAM !"
"I...I congratulate you."
And so in Speedy's fancy,...
...Chet Trask was tottering on his throne ...
The Tattler wonders ...
...who will step forward this
year to be our host...
...at the customary Fall Frolic.
It will be remembered that the host
of last year's gala event was ...
...Chet Trask, who was later voted ...
the most popular man in college.
Harold (Speedy) Lamb
requests the pleasure of your presence
at his Fall Frolic
October 25, 1924
at the Hotel Tate
The host -- how he hoped to look for $38.50
"It 's one of his dizzy spells, Mr Lamb ...
...a little brandy always fixes him right up."
"There's no danger of
not having my suit ...
...ready for the party, is there ?"
The Fall Frolic
The crowning achievement
of Speedy the Spender.
"It's after ten o'clock...I wonder
what's keeping Speedy."
"With the whole college waiting,...
...you pick out a day like
this for dizzy spells !"
"I only had time to baste it ... so
be careful...
...it's just loosely sitched together."
"Easy ... EASY ... EASY !...
I'd better go with you in
case anything happens !"
"All hail ... our host !"
"If anything rips, I'll
ring this bell."
"Speedy, old pal, can you let
me have ten dollars ?"
"I'd be all right ...
...if I could only get a little drink. "
"Just for that, you little fool,...
...I'm going to tell you what this
bunch really thinks of you !"
"You think you're a regular fellow ...why,...
...you're nothing but the college boob !"
"Ever since you came to college,...
we've just been kidding you...
look ...."
"I'm just a regular fellow ...
...step right up and call me Speedy !"
"It doesn't bother me a bit...
...really; a fellow has to expect those
things, you know."
"For he's a jolly good fellow !"
"Harold, you haven't been
true to yourself ...
...you've been pretending to
be what you though ...
...they wanted you to be."
"Stop pretending, Harold...be yourself !
get out and make theme like you for...
...what you really are and
what you can do !"
"There's just one chance left ...
...if I ever get in that big game
against Union State,...
...I'll show them !"
The day of days!
When every heart in
Tate stood still ...
...and all the world watched football
history in the making.
"Look at Speedy on the bench...
...he still thinks he has a chance
to get in the game !"
QUARTER: 4TH
MINUTES TO PLAY: 14
"I'm afraid Union State is
too heavy for our boys...
they've knocked out almost
the whole Tate team."
"Quick, see if any of the
boys who were hurt ...
...can get back in the game...
...I have only one substitute left !"
"There's only two of us left, old boy !...
...we'll get into this game yet !"
"Wait... I'll get Speedy to change
sweaters with you."
"Hard luck, Dave, old fellow !...
...They're sending me in ahead of you !"
"Take off your sweater and give it to Miller ."
"There's only ten minutes to go...I
won't quit now, ...
...I tell you... I won't !"
"Why, we've just been kidding you
...you're only the water boy."
"You listen, now ! I wasn't kidding !...
...I've been working...and fighting ...
...just for this chance... and you've
got to give it to me !"
"You've had enough time out, send
in your substitute !"
"You have one minute to send
in a substitute ...
...or else forfeit the game !"
"Come on, you old women !...
...Are you afraid of mussing your hair?
...Don't you know how to fight ?"
"Atta boy, Speedy...
a twenty yard again !"
"When you hear this whistle,
put that ball down !"
"They may kick ...
I better play back...
hey ?"
"Two minutes to go!"
"One minute left to play ...
and you've...
...thrown away our last chance !"
"I can't look !
Is it over the line ?"
I knew you could do it...
...I'm so proud ... and I love you ...
The End
