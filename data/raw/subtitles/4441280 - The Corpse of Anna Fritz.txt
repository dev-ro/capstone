Actress Anna Fritz found dead at a party.
The autopsy takes place tomorrow morning.
The name of the hospital where the body is not yet published.
The news of her tragic death came as a shock to the entire world.
- It is totally sick. - A damn hospital. What did you think?
You can call the Pau, the night guard?
Tack.
Would you fuck Chinese language? Both of them, that is.
- Kinesiskor are flat chested. - 3000 euros and you get your dream tits.
Kinesiskor docile.
My colleague did. They are grateful that they are so ugly.
There he is! How is the situation, buddy?
- What's up? - What are you doing here?
We wonder if you have more pictures.
We joke only! You need to get out for a while.
- Are you having a party? - No, I work at twelve.
It is only one hour. Where can we draw the line?
- I work. - Only one.
- No, I said. - Come on now!
But hurry up on.
- What is this shit? - Do not touch them. There are trash cans.
- Why did you bring us? It stinks. - You can go if you want.
- Place the bottle. - Relax.
- Only one line. - I want to get in the festive mood.
But I actually work.
- I do not know if I want to go. - What's with you? You never go out.
- You can get pussy. Do not like it? - Yes, but I have to be up early.
A lot of paperwork and the four autopsies.
- Change the job, then. - No, I like it.
I am alone and have to be alone.
Anna Fritz! May she rest in peace.
It is enough. Let's go.
Wait.
Damn it, come on now, Ivan.
- We can not stand this. - Have more photos?
Secure nude pictures.
- You footed just the face. - Yes, I sent.
You checked safely on her tits, dirty old man.
Would not you have done it?
- Is she still in the hospital? - Until tomorrow.
- At the morgue. Do you want to go? - We go and look at her.
Ivan.
Ivan, damn it!
That's enough, guys.
- Are you sure that you want to go? - Yes. Where is the morgue?
In the basement.
Ivan, the clock is already half past twelve.
- Waiting for us here? - Shit...
This way.
- What a damn maze! - It is to d√∂ingarna shall not escape.
No unauthorized persons may be here. Will someone, then say that you have gone astray
and that I follow you out.
- Ivan, I risk losing my job. - Sure.
Here it is.
- Are you crazy? - Open.
- I'll wait outside. - You can not stand this. In with you!
What do you say? Do you like my office?
- I'm leaving. - How the hell either, Javi.
What do we say if we get caught? We got lost? Stop it...
They notify me if someone comes.
Where is Anna Fritz?
Tell!
Are you prepared?
Guys ...
I've never seen a dead person.
I do not know. It gives me the creeps.
You'll see that she does not even looks dead.
- Holy shit! - You bastard! Are you retarded or something?
- Fucking idiot! - He is stupid.
Stop fucking now.
Where is she?
Cover that shit.
Seriously now.
Come on.
It was like hell ...
- Of course she does not see the death like? - No.
She's only been here a few hours.
- What are you doing? - Damn ...
Ivan, buddy ...
I can not believe I squeezed Anna Fritz tits.
Stir them. Trust me.
- She is cold. - What did you think?
- Are you sure that nobody comes? - Not until twelve.
- We pull a rope. - I refuse snort here.
Only one.
- It is enough. I want to go to the party. - It's early yet.
He has a date.
- Are there more girls? - No not today.
Half of Spain wants to put on Anna Fritz
and here is she nude.
Fy fan...
You like her, right? You seemed a bit disgusted before.
She is so perfect.
She is crappy looking.
How it is to fuck a dead woman? Dick goes well not even enter, huh?
With saliva.
- How do you know that? - The vagina is like a living woman.
It's just not wet, and when you fuck, so it does not pull together.
- Have you tried, right? - No.
Why not? I would work here, and such a girl came in ...
It happens in many hospitals. It's hard to get caught.
And you've never done anything? Nothing?
Promise not to say anything to anybody?
Once they took in a crappy-looking girl.
- How old was she? - Seventeen or eighteen.
She was delicious.
I have pictures of her.
- I put on her. - Bullshit.
Why do not you go out. They never say no.
So it's enough with a little saliva?
And Anna?
- If you did not put on her? - No.
You put on somebody unknown bride, but not Anna Fritz? Come on...
He'll probably do that when we have gone.
- Shall we put on her all three? - And spraying her in your face?
Let's go to the party instead. There are girls that are wet.
But they are not Anna Fritz.
I do it.
- Why not? - Come now. You're just full.
- We do not hurt her. She's dead. - Now, you quit.
Do as you wish.
- Are you sure that nobody comes? - Most certainly.
- Are you going to stand here and look like wimps? - I'm out.
No, wait. Come, we go in here.
He will not put on her. Does he think I'm stupid or something?
He just wants to run with you and make me angry.
- He can not fuck a dead woman. - It looks as if he can.
Damn him!
There is a corpse, a bloody corpse!
For the hell! That was why I wanted to come here.
I can not believe that.
Damn, he fucks!
Do not say anything. I do not know. I feel sick just thinking about it.
It's over. He is ready.
- How was it? - Fantastic.
Drive. It is worth it.
- I do it. - Pau, damn it!
- You do not know what you're missing. - You fucked with doing!
- Just pretend she's full. - Okay to Pau do it, but you?
- It was a lovely experience. - How the hell either!
- How can you know if you do not test? - What if someone fuck your dead sister?
Who should do it when they do not even fucking her alive?
It's just a corpse. We do not know her.
I do not know what I'm doing here. Damn...
Wait until Pau is finished and then we go to the party.
- A rope? - Not to me.
What is it?
- She's alive! She opened her eyes. - What the hell are you saying, Pau?
Look at her!
What do we do now?
- Just calm. - Download water!
What is it with you?
Do you remember how you woke up?
This is water.
Gently. Just peace. There, there ...
What are we doing? Should we take her? Should we call a doctor?
Are you cold?
I'll be right back.
- Are you sure she saw you? - Hell, yeah! I promise.
- What if she does not know, then? - It's fucking impossible.
I will help you. I found nothing.
I do not know how to sit.
Now I know. It will link it here.
- Can we talk a little? - Pau, take her to ...
Let's think this through.
- What was that? - Damn, somebody's coming!
It is enough the night guard. We have to hide.
Where?
Inside!
- What are you doing? - We tell you later.
It does not matter now, but they do not see us.
I'm sorry. My name is Javier.
- What are you doing? - Do not touch me!
- Can we talk? In there. - There's nothing to talk about.
Pau may say that she was alive.
Just a little while.
Do not leave me.
I'll be back.
- What do you want? - Do they know we raped her ...
- You thought it was a corpse. - We put on her.
Do not you get it? It's over for us. She is known.
- It comes out in the media. - She saw me.
Damn, my parents ...
She did not know where she was. She does not know what you did.
Well, she knows.
- She knows, and she will talk. - Bad luck for you! Nothing to do anything about.
Everyone thinks she is dead.
For people she's dead.
Her family, the community and all others believe she has deoxycholate.
- Are you going to kill her? Are you crazy? - Listen to me! Nobody gets out.
- Should all know that we raped her? - Are you going to kill her for it?
- She was dead. - She's alive! You know now!
- Think a little on us. - Should I think of you?
Pau, help me to take her out.
It is easy for those who have not done anything, but Pau and I ...
Listen to me. That's your problem.
Had you done that, you would have let it ruin your life?
- What would you have done? - Move!
Pau and I go to jail, but it do not care about you! I ask you, Javi.
Take your ass! You are asking me to kill her!
Open the door!
Nobody leaves the room.
Take me out of here, please.
Please ...
I will take you from here.
- Javi, please ... - touch me and I overlap to you.
Shit! It is locked.
- Why is it locked? - He locked when he took up the corpse.
Keys.
Pau, where the hell are the keys?
They are outside.
- Help! - Be quiet!
Stop it!
Now motherfuckers will get!
Ivan!
Ivan, stop!
Ivan!
Tell?
Tell?
Javi? Javi?
Javi, wake up now!
He breathes, but he has lost a lot of blood.
Bring a tourniquet.
I'm sorry, Javi. Excuse me, buddy.
We have to take him to a doctor.
Can you get out of here?
I can call on someone.
We take them there and then, ask for help.
When they open, we take Javi somewhere where they can find him.
Help me.
Tell?
Javi, are you all right?
Javi, responding to hell! Javi ?!
Can you hear me?
He's losing a lot of blood.
Go get her!
Tell ...
It was not on purpose. You know that?
Sorry, it was an accident.
Tell?
- We have to clean up. - Do it then!
We leave you at the entrance. They will find you right away.
Javi, they will ask questions.
They stole your wallet. You get it back later.
You were alone. Pau and I was not with you.
It is important that you listen.
You and I drank in the park. You did not go to the party, so you went.
Then you will find what you want, okay?
They beat you, you took to the hospital and passed out.
Anything. I trust you. Do not mention her.
I would do the same for you. Hold on now, Javi.
- When will they be here? - Five minutes after I seek them.
I'm sorry...
I'll get help.
Do not move. Do not do it.
- How long will that take? - They will be here soon.
He does not feel well.
Javi, wake up now!
They will soon take care of you.
They will be here soon and open. Hold on a little longer. Close your eyes do not.
- He's going to bleed to death. - Quiet, or I'll quiet you!
- Pau? - Help!
- What are you locked up here? - Nothing.
My stupid colleague locked me up.
- You look worn. - I slept badly.
Let's go. I should already be home.
- And Anna? - What then?
Actress Anna Fritz. Is not she here?
Yes I think so.
Let's go.
Fucking bitch! Cry if you want.
Javi, now it is open. I will take you from here.
Javi? Javi?
Tell?
Fan!
He is dead.
Ivan?
He is dead.
I tried to revive him, but ...
It had not helped raise him.
He was already poor.
We could not have done anything.
Life in prison...
No.
We take him out and dumps him in a garbage can.
Come again.
Have not you had enough? Take me away from here. I promise not to say anything.
- How can we know it? - I swear!
- Do not talk to her. - What if she will not tell me?
Why would not she? She will tell.
Our future depends on what we do.
If we are not strong, so we have to pay for the rest of their lives.
Pau...
We killed Javi.
It is thirty years. She has us in his hands.
You killed him.
You were with.
You learn prosecuted for complicity.
Want to get life imprisonment for murder?
And do you want your parents to know that you're fucking dead women?
Is that what you want?
Swear.
No.
What you what it means?
Saw it.
- Do not kill her ... - Do you have something better suggestions?
We must do it.
What do we do with Javi?
How do we get him out of the hospital?
Through the emergency exit.
But first, we take care of her.
Fucking bitch!
- She tried to call. - To my father.
- Check whether it is true. - What makes you think I do?
And?
- Its over. - She called?
He'll get help and then he comes here.
I said only that I woke up.
What do we do now?
She called his mobile. There's nothing we can do.
It's over. Its over.
We take her up.
I'll call Mom. I want her to hear it from me.
Jabez mobil.
- Who is it? - There is no name.
- And? - Papa!
Who is it?
Was it really from this number?
And no one answered?
What does it matter who I am?
- Fucking bitch! - I promise not to say anything.
How the hell either! To the morgue.
Help! Help!
Help!
You almost succeeded.
I must admit that you're a damn good actor.
Fucked you, your pigs.
Shut up!
- You are dead, and the dead do not talk. - That's enough.
No wonder you rape corpses. You are disgusting!
A squeak and I fuck you until you burst!
It was better.
Now we're wasting no more time.
I'll get a dustbin for Javi.
Do you know were they stand?
Where we were before. I'll go get one.
And what should I do?
Bind her.
Pau.
Do not listen to him.
Do you do as he says, you'll end up in jail.
You are not a murderer.
Certainly not you?
You are not there, Pau.
Help him not to kill me. You may not do it.
I'm alive because of you. I promise not to say anything.
Pau!
I beg you...
Let me out and go from here. You have not done anything.
I beg you...
On the fucking floor?
- Garbage cans. - Zero.
Are you going to tie her or not?
- Pau, get out of here now. - I can not. I'll just tie you up.
I know we look like monsters, but we did not want to make someone ill.
- I wanted to show that there was a celebrity. - Pau, get me out of here.
- I can not, for Ivan ... - Ivan is a killer. He killed Javi!
It was an accident.
He strangled him in front of me when you were not here.
He did not take him to the hospital. It was just a lie.
- He'll say you did everything. - I can not trust you.
- Please, take me away from here. - You lied before. I can not trust you.
I told you. It is busy at night.
Two hours left. I long to go to bed.
I agree, but first I want to eat. Chicken with mustard.
- Are you going to ask you cook now? - No, I cooked for the in-laws.
Two tablespoons of mustard, ten minutes and then it's ready.
- It's delicious. - Come on, let's go.
I'll take a little tomorrow, if they have not eaten it all.
Wait.
Pau!
She ran away, stupid!
- Why did you leave her alone? - I tied after her.
Go that way.
No, please!
You think you're so smart. Now you are in the shit.
It's over to you.
Come now! I have her!
I'm tired of this. Now we get it over with.
Okay?
What's with you?
You killed Javi.
- I know. Why do it now? - When I was not there.
You strangled him.
- What did I do? - She said that.
And you believe her?
She just wants to turn you against me.
Do not listen to her.
So I strangled Javi? I'm going to kill you because you're such a fucking bitch.
You were dead, and the dead will be.
How are you thinking...?
I do not know. With something that does not leave marks.
With tablets.
- What pills? - Do not know. There must be here.
- It may take hours to die. - With a pillow, then.
- Where are the cushions? - Up there, but I can not go up.
With a sheet, then.
I?
I can not.
- Why should I do that? - It was your idea.
If we get caught, so I killed two and you have not done anything.
You do it.
I'm not a murderer.
But it's me?
It's not as hard for you.
So for me it is not so difficult?
We do both.
Damn, she pees on himself.
Until she stops breathing.
It's done.
It's done.
We could not have done anything else.
Get up. Yet we have not finished.
Now we take Javi.
I'll take him out.
Everything will be as it was. Leave no proof.
Clean her up.
Pretending to be dead.
Be quiet.
- What are you doing? - Nothing.
Let's go. I have everything.
- Are you sure we have not forgotten anything? - Yes, I did clean it all.
I do not know.
It feels as if we have forgotten something.
- Did you clean her properly? - Yes.
Come now.
We walk through the parking lot. The output is the most discreet.
Well then...
It's over now.
What is it?
Damn! My card. I forgot it in the morgue.
- I can get it tomorrow. - How the hell either!
Wait, Ivan!
Ivan...
What did you think? Go to the police and say that it was my fault?
You bastard!
You agreed with her.
Ivan...
Do not try to talk it out here. Fool me, you do not. Do you get it?
Do you want to go to jail, right?
He thought about going.
We would just go.
