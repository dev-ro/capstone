<font color = "# ffff00"> But that's all wrong. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It can implement virtual worlds

is a ranking system. </ font>

beating the Boss. </ font>

</ font>

the item, huh? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Even if you are a second-ranked
player do not be cocky first. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I can not be defeated easily lo.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes even though his boss movement
pattern is already known. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Because I'm using my own body
now I'm all sick. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I'm surprised his boss can be
defeated with a few players. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Me and Asuna once fought it once. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But other players seem less experienced
so the battle feels heavy. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Kirito to the taunts. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I'm just not used to direct combat.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Ah but because there is Yuna who
encouraged us, her last present... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Eh, sister meet Yuna while fighting? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Is that correct? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Kirito. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I was satisfied even though I did not see the concert!
I missed Yuna's concert tickets, anyway. </ Font>

<font color = "# ffff00"> Yeah, I know.
I'll give you one, deh. </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I will also give it to Leafa, deh. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Hurray! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But I'm on a special Kendo
club excursion trip! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What's more, anyway?
In the  Ordinal Scale  game until the SAO Boss appears? </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> There does not seem to be any suspicious yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> In addition the company behind SAO & Argus
development also no longer exists, anyway. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Are there any players who are aware
that it is SAO Boss? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Might not exist. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I guess who knows about the motion
of our boss is just us. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  Switch!  </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What do you think, Kirito? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes, Asuna is right. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But if there are many SAO bosses popping up in this game
sooner or later other players will be aware. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The point is also very high. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Aincrad may be resurrected in
the real world, yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But this does not threaten our lives
like  Nerve Gear , is not it? </ font>

something tell me! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Okay, Papa. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If I can fight with Yuna, I
want to come too. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Me too. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> This time I can definitely  nebeng
on Kirito's motorcycle. </ font>

<font color = "# ffff00"> What's up Yuna? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What is this thing? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It is proof that everyone
likes your song. </ font>

<font color = "# ffff00"> From now on, it will be
collected a lot. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> To discuss all these people! </ font>

<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes I have a lot to learn, I'm
getting carried away. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Finding info about the university is good, but it's good
if your sister is exercising not to be stiff. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> All right, later when you change clothes
deh. I leave it by him. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> We recommend you use this too. </ font>

<font color = "# ffff00"> Suguha (Leafa) has left for
his club activities. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You must be lonely. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> That's right. No one who wakes me
up in the morning is hard. </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Gosh. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You should not be late eating, lo! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yeah this way I'm used to
eating myself lo. </ font>

focused you forget to eat. </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Everyday Papa's menu is
special spicy anyway. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Good if I do not need to cover it. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Kirito, about our conversation yesterday
my mom wanted to meet you. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Ah, sometime aja ya? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The ALO mission is now publicized. </ font>

<font color = "# ffff00"> Everything is playing

<font color = "# ffff00"> Right also. But I'm sure they'll
come back later. </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> {\ an5}  Hey Asuna there is a rumor saying that the SAO
boss will appear at this location, can you join me? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Hey Asuna, over here. </ font>

</ font>

and I rushed here. </ font>

</ font>

will be there soon. </ font>

<font color = "# ffff00"> Why is it here too? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It's great. The acquisition group
can not be underestimated. </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But, I will show you the difference
between dream and real world. </ font>

conquests for fear of dying. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The style of play is very strange yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> When you see it playing like
that in AR game... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> He's just a top class player. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Why do not you greet him? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> No. </ font>

<font color = "# ffff00"> Asuna, is there any news recently
about ghosts or something? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Duh stop that, Kirito! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You know I can not stand it, do you?
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Ah, that's right... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Right also kirito, about our promise at the time.
I did not give Mother with whom I went. </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Ehh, then. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But just relax we have to
prepare everything. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes you're right. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Papa, Mama... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I know something! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Everyone sees this! Until now there
are many bosses out at 21:00, </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Here is where Mama and Papa fight
with the Samurai Boss. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> This is where Mama was
fighting yesterday. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I will also show data about
other bosses appear. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Then I'll combine it with the
nine-level Aincrad map. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> This... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The place of occurrence The boss is very
similar to the Aincrad map. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> More precisely the monster appears
following the pattern on the map. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> This is where the next boss
appears can be predicted. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Tonight I'm predicting the appearance of
a monster near Shibuya station. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If the place is already known
I can also follow! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The event starts at night what
do you keep coming? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If with everyone it's okay. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> My parents also will not protest
because I play with AR. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> That's it. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I have to work so I can not join. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Eh kirito, you're not coming? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Ah I do not want. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What? do not you like AR? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> There is a business. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Let's show our cooperation to Yuna!
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> By the way where is the Client? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Either he is playing  Ordinal Scale ?
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Right yesterday he asked me to follow the
event but finally he did not come. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The reason is because its members
are still not collected. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The AR game has to move the whole body
too, so it's very inconvenient. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The meeting place should be determined
before viewing the falling star yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Already, tonight let's party. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yui, about the star viewing event
do not tell anyone. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Sorry. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> In addition, can you send us data
about where his boss appears? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Well, I understand. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Hello, Kirito. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Ah, Asuna. wait a minute. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It turned out just to use pasta yes? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Just for today, when I look at the recipe book
its contents are just that-that's all. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You should pay attention to the nutrition. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Then make me rabbit soup again. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> That's hard. But if I find the
ingredients I'll make it! </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Ah yes! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I'm looking forward to it! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Hey, Kirito. About the ghost you
were talking about... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I'm wondering if that's true. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> After that I find out the info. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> This is uncertain, but there are some players
who see someone wearing a white robe. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> So yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Do-do you look at it? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Where possible. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Maybe those people misunderstand
it and it's just NPC. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Maybe that's true. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Also, there is also a lantern
and can still be used. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Thanks, I'm glad I can go
to your house. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Give my regards to your father yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Ah yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I can not wait to see the star. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Guild Leader Fuurinkazan, Client yes? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Have gathered quite a lot huh? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> True. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But the main dish still
does not exist. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Are you interested, Yuna? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The letters are hard to read.
What is a complicated book? </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> This is not just a picture of
my memory in the past. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  If I draw a sword in Japan, no
player can stand up? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What's this, so cool!
Eiji quickly see this one. </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Finally we meet! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Are you looking for me? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It turns out you're not a ghost huh. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Who are you, are you looking
for something from me? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Hello. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Finally connected as well. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Ah sorry I'm on my way, what's wrong? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The Client turned out yesterday he was hospitalized,
he said the bone in his hand was broken. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What? Is he an accident? </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I do not know for sure, but when playing
 Ordinal Scale he has a problem. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> So yes! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Please tell me the details later. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Papa! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yuna, today is coming right? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Silica what do you think about Yuna?
do you think it's just a program or a human being? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I do not think he's human, but I
guess he's not just AI. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> True, if she can sing like that's not
possible if she's human. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> In other words you do not like
my singing style huh? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Heh. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I did not say that. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I do not want to go karaoke with you anymore. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Sorry-sorry, forgive me. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It is time. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What are you all ready for now? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Well the battle will start! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Turn on the music! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yuna. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> We're lucky. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Okay let's fight to collect points.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The attack is very far from
what I expected. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> As per our plan. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If this goes on I can die. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Your group is only female
but you are great! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> We also will not lose! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yosh, let's compete. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  Ordinal Scale, activated!  </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Papa. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Looks like the girl... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You're a former member of Guild KoB
Ketsume Kishidan, Nautilus right? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Do not call me by that name, Asuna.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Eiji. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Looks like you're pretty
good at this game. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I'm different from the old one. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You also seem to have changed a lot.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Is it true? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It used to be a lot of things
happening yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It's about time. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Will someone appear again? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Pina. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Pina came to save me huh? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Silica!
Run fast! </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Papa it is a high level boss who
controls the 91st floor. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Ruler of floor 91? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Pina what are you doing? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Sorry. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Silica! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Silica! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Asuna, be aware? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What Asuna is okay? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You .. What are you doing! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It's so sad. The strongest knight in the VR
world turned out just like this in AR. </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What did you say? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Hey where is your courtesy
as a player? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Too bad! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Good work. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Wait for the bonus? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Hey you guys did not come to
rescue Asuna huh. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Asuna, are you okay? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Too bad today is so much. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Sorry Asuna.
Because I'm this careless... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You were driven by the second-ranked
player right? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What do you want? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yahh... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But Asuna is great.
The former Deputy Commander was great. </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What's up, Asuna? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> No, it's okay. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Then till tomorrow, good work. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Kirito. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What's up? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Do you remember the time we first met?
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Of course that is the moment where we fight
against the second floor boss in Aincrad. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Right, you invited me to
join your party. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> That's right, in retrospect I'm
surprised it can happen. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Hey the lake is visible from here! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I can not see it. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Kirito do not go alone! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Kirito? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Kirito. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Who are you? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Not possible? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Dream? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Kirito. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Kirito. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Not possible, why? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Hello? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Why call me now?
Do not be dark-smack like this! </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Sorry for calling you like
this at night. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> That's okay, besides what happened. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> We've been here since when? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Eh not since we bought this house in SAO
era? Maybe it's been two years. </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> So yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Asuna... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I thought I could not remember it.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Remember what? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The incident in Aincrad, I
can not remember it. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> About meeting with you, our
fight & this house. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What are you talking about, Asuna? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You're kidding, are not you? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> As time went by I lost my
memory of SAO. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Now it no longer exists. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I can not show the data in detail.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But inside Asuna's brain there has been
a process of memory scanning. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Memory scan? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> So that only applies to memories
of the SAO era huh? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But how can it be? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> In retrospect the strong memories
of the events in SAO. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But that could be the key to
being a memory gate. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> And if the memory is used it
can generate an image. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> There's been a lot of coverage
on this case recently. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Maybe this is just a coincidence. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But everyone who is experiencing the same case
also follows the AR game fight event. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Then... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Augma is the cause? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It still can not be ascertained. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Is Asuna okay? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> For now there is no interference
with his brain. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Possible because of the scanning effect,
some of its memories are deleted. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But I can not tell you how much
memory will be lost. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> In other words, is it possible that
his memory will disappear? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Sorry Kirito. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Take it easy you still remember
the recent events right? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The incident in SAO is indeed
appalling is not it? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You can remember it again. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Asuna? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What's up, Asuna? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Asuna! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> How? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Sorry Kirito. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I can not remember it. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I remember the moment we bought
this house in ALO. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But I can not remember the
incident in SAO. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Mama! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Sorry Yui. when it is our
precious memories. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I will also find out what happened
to the game  Ordinal Scale. </ font>

<font color = "# ffff00"> Hey! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Sorry! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Let's go! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I do not know if this is an accident or
there is a dalang behind all this. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But it is possible that this
event will continue. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> In other words other SAO Survivor might
lose its memory like Asuna huh? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If I lose then my memory... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If my memory disappears how my relationship
with Asuna can run as usual? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Papa, sorry. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I can not find a player named Eiji.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If you just rely on the player list, I
can not find useful information. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> So yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Fight, Papa. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I will compile data from each battle
and search for clues! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes, I know. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I leave it to you, Yui. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Good. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You look okay. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Sinon, why? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If fighting with the Boss can harm
others then I'm in exception. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But this is really a danger. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If killed by the Boss, then
you can like Asuna. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Take it easy! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I'm not SAO Suvivor, if memory scanning
happens then I'll be fine. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Really, Yui? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> True, it's like that. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It's still uncertain... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If you're worried about me, you
should protect me yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Papa, invite Sinon! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  Ordinal Scale, activated!  </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It's the 18th floor boss, Dire Tusk! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Is not this time the 13th floor Boss?
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> This time there are different bosses
that will appear one by one. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Excessive yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Additionally where his boss
appears is random! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Really appears Dire Tusk! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Good! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> We should work together immediately. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I'll go as planned! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The boss is really careless. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Stay away! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It's started. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You're too pushy. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Today he is not there. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You're great. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Sorry, I am very helpful. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You have to pay for it with a
cake in Ginza yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I love a coupon to eat at Gyudon, so
let's just say we break even. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I do not need that. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Then take me home with your motors.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yuna? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Wait a minute!
You're actually... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Sorry Papa. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> There was a little more but
I was intercepted. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But when the player gets hit from the Boss there is one
player who is scanned with some sort of program. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Is that so? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Shit! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Do you want to say something? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> No! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  Search  </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Right too! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yui, can you remember the direction the
veiled girl is pointing to? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes, what is it? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Combine direction with Tokyo city map.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> A building in Ookayama? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yui, what are you doing there? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Papa, it's a building belonging to
Touto Technology University. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> So he told me to come here yes! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I will search for data about the
player at the University. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> That person? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The figure behind the development of Augma,
Professor Shigemura Tetsuhiro. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Augma? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Full drive and Augmented Reality are
technologies in the past. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> In addition, Full Drive is
the problem itself. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> To be able to play VR games. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The player must disconnect from the real
world and the risk is huge. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Of course technology related to Full
Drive is not just a game. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Communications, broswing and data protection. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But they are just restrictions on what
information can be collected. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> So instead of using Dangerous Full Drive, it's
only natural that we switch using AR. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> So far what has any questions? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Then you're there! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> AR does not have big risk like Full Drive, but
if there is danger what do you think? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What is a question about
recent events? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> No, but I am asking about how deep the machine
can navigate the depth of information. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Full Drive technology is like turning
illusion into reality. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But what AR technology can turn
reality into an illusion? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> That question I will answer later,
today just got here. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Immediately. Do you know players of
Ordinal Scale, ranked Eiji two? </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> No. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Is not she included in your class? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Here there are many students. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Then do you know about the case of
SAO player memory loss? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What is Augma doing a scan on
the players' brains? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Did you hear all that from Kikuoka?
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> After Augma goes abnormally I can
tell if I investigate it. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If this goes on Augma can be
erased like  Nerve Gear. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Do you want to take the same
path as Kayaba Akihiko? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What are you talking about? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If memory scanning
is possible, </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> So why bother memories of
lost SAO players? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> There are many statements
from various parties. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Do not all SAO players want to forget
about the scary event? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If you have any other questions
just put it in the report. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But you're also not someone who
deserves my free time. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Do you want to create a robot? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Excuse. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It is true that Shigemura
has a princess. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> No, I mean I have a princess. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But he died two years ago. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yuna? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I do not know if you know this, but
her daughter used Nerve Gear. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> He is a victim of SAO. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What does this mean?
What exactly is this all for? </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Probably the same as the Professor said, erasing
all the bad memories of SAO Survivor. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Anyway, it's possible that
Augma is dangerous. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Uncle Kikouka, can not you provide
special services to handle this? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> We are working on it, but our opponent
is a company with a big project. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But there's no hard evidence, we can
not move & we need time. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> There are many players  Ordinal Scale
who used to be an SAO player. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If they keep playing against Aincrad boss, players
who lose their memory will continue to grow. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> We will try as hard as possible. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The client and his friends who are being treated
are also experiencing the same problem. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Rather than worrying about their memories,
I'm more worried about their bodies. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Kirito, if you can not fight
his boss yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If your memory disappears we
can get into trouble. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What's up? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> No, I just want to hear your voice.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> So yes! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Here's Asuna, can we meet now. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes, if you can not do anything anyway. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Okay, but I'm a little scared
when I go out. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Okay, then I'll go to your house.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I'm also near Ookayama, so I'll be
up in about 20 minutes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Excuse me! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> No need to behave like that. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Now there is no one anybody. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But this is the first time for me, I
should have brought something yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I do not need that, Please login!
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> There are some people who want SAO players to
forget the horrible events of the past. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> On the other hand, it sounds right.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It is true that there are many frightening
and sad things that have happened. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But the incident that has passed
for two years in SAO is, </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The foundation for creating our memories now. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> So this is the smart room people
are talking about right? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But the atmosphere is very similar
to your house in Salemburg. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I'll get you a drink. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Just sit down first. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  For me tomorrow.  </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  Lately I did forget
to write it, </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  But maybe I'll forget that I'm
back in the real world, </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  So I will write this feeling now.  </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  It has been four years
since Kirito met. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  My memory with Kirito is like
a shining crystal. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  If my memory disappears because
of Ordinal Scale, </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  And I make new memories with him,
everything will be fine, right? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  We will go to Mount Saitama
to see stars. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  But the memory of the appointment
may disappear. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  Looks like Kirito promised me a gift.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  Will he forgive me, if I
forget the promise? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  I want to give him a gift as well
but I'm not allowed to work. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  Therefore I want to collect as many points
as possible and give him something. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  I like Kirito!  </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  If I get over Kirito too...  </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  If this feeling also disappears...  </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  If I can not create new
memories with them... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  Just thinking about it scares me.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  Please tomorrow, do not
forget this feeling! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Do not worry, you may read it. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Asuna, sorry-sorry! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I like you, Kirito. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Very likes you. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Even though my memory of SAO disappears
this feeling will not disappear! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Me too, Asuna. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I love you. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> From the past until now
and until later. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I promise I can definitely
restore your memory. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> So trust me, Asuna! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> There is a falling star. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Hey Eiji, finally it will
happen tomorrow. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I will realize my dream of
singing freely! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes, are you nervous? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> No. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Not at all. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I can sing for everyone so
I'm very happy. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> And I will become Diva number one! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Right, I'll help you shine the world.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Hey read the book again, Eiji. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes of course. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> This time what stories will
appear in the book? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I want to know. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Nothing. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I'm not showing up in this book. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The person who does not appear in an inappropriate
match is entered in this book. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Basic! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You work too casually. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The police have begun to be suspicious. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Hurry up! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Okay, I got it! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I have prepared a map for the last phase, you
will fulfill that promise, right? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Of course I will not forget it. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I beg you. In addition, Yuna began to
show interest other than singing. </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> This is the effect of the sample we get,
we have to continue our plan. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I understand. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yuna, huh? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Where is this? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What is this dream or... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Dreams and virtual worlds are almost the same. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> When you wake up only the memories
left in your mind. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Memory? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Maybe this is all just a dream. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Complete the game of death and
return to the real world. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> When you wake up you are still
inside Aincrad. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Do you ever think so? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I've thought about it, but I do not
want it if it happens. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> So yeah, so you've been
in SAO too, huh? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Are you the daughter of Professor Shigemura? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Are you still alive? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What can I get after telling me
to meet the Professor? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Why Professor has the heart to
take Asuna's memory? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Augma is for what? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I just want to sing, it's
my long time. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What should I do? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What should I do to save Asuna?
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If you want to save Asuna then your
current level is not enough. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Now the time is almost here. Wake up! </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Are you okay? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Are you playing the game Augma? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Lately the game is popular but
you have to be careful. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Do not get into trouble yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> That's it, so it looks like
Silica will go first. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> So that ever happened, huh? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If only I could follow the fight...
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The client is also hospitalized, so it
might be good if he does not come. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Kirito is... even though he forbids others from playing
Ordinal Scale, but he is playing alone. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I also helped him, anyway. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Then I will teach Kendo's brother to
use it to play in that game. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Beautiful affection among
brothers, yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Lisbeth next we will all
sing together. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The concert will start tomorrow
so we must be ready! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Quickly hold the mic! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If this is where the problem
might be done? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But Asuna looks really happy. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Is that correct? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Hey, what's up? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Are you okay? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Just like before this time the 20th to
30th floor bosses will pop up! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I will beat everything with
the fastest route! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> He it... actually accepted all
his wounds alone? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Great! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What's up? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> This is just a game, so do
not get too serious. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> This is just for fun, is not it? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Move! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Well, a special concert will start!
Everything is fighting! </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Lucky! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Congratulations! Finally you learn how
to play in this game, huh? </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Swordsman Black. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I replaced Yuna to give a gift.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Heh, Yuna fans are so many ya! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> My favorite note...
You're too fast running. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Silicia, thanks for yesterday. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> No problem, really. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But unfortunately for them, yes? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Eh, where is Kirito? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> He went to the toilet for a while. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I'm coming as promised. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I will take back Asuna's memory.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Do not be strong, Pedek Hitam Black.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You are a Nautilus, are not you? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> A player who is afraid of death
and avoids any battles. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Now I am Eiji! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It was a past event, you know
very well about me yes. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I've heard it from someone
who knows better. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> So it turns out you're still not satisfied with
the Flash, and now you're after Yuna too? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What are you talking about? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes it does not matter. But if you think again can
you beat a second-ranked player like me? </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If we have not tried we will not know. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You do not seem to be
number one either! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00">  Ordinal Scale, activated!  </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Taking advantage of my position in Argus, </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I did give Nerve Gear and SAO to Yuna.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> My daughter just put on her sweet face. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But because of my ignorance,
the boy was killed! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yuna! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Heh, the conqueror of the SAO game is
different from the others. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> With this limited ability can get a
second rank? Nothing to matter! </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> In the end only the people who fight on the front
line will be remembered by everyone. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The weak like me and Yuna will
not be remembered! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> So you're with Yuna in SAO? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> True! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> He also disappeared very quickly! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I understand how weak I am! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Even though I have someone I love, but
my feet still will not move! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yuna's brain is already in an irreparable
condition because of  Nerve Gear. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But if I can get Yuna's memory
from SAO player. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> After collecting and merging the
broken pieces of memory, </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The rest I live doing  deep learning.  </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I can relive Yuna via AI. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The number in the Ordinal
system is absolute. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> And someone who earned a first
rank will be immortal. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Did not you design it, Kayaba? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Therefore you name it Yuna.
latin for number one yes? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> To match the Cardinal system
functions used in Aincrad, </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The Ordinal system is controlled
by ordinal number. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You have noticed the system concept I used
before the development of SAO, </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> And gave birth to a new game. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It's true maybe I'm the one who would
have assumed the same. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But now I believe. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> There is a power that can go
beyond the system itself. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Would not it be nice if I took a
rotten memory of SAO? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Is this the source of your power? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Shit! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Just because of the bad
experience, </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Not that you have to lose someone
who rejects the past. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Well tell me how to restore
Asuna's memory! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Ah, great fun! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It's too late. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> There are a lot of SAO players
gathered here. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> We will do memory scans on all
SAO players here. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> All their memories will be taken then
Yuna will come back to life. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What? What do you mean? </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Well, it's started. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Nothing can stop it! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I got the info from inside Kamura,
the Augma developer company. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> There are currently many drones floating in the stadium and
connected to the high frequency Augma connection. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What does it mean? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> In the stadium there may be many people who will
experience memory loss because of the scan. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Then... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> True, it's like  Nerve Gear that affects
the brain and can cause death. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> We will try to stop it! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Kirito, you have to give everyone
orders to release Augma. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What's going on here? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> What's happening? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Open the door!
What happened? </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Asuna! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Asuna, sorry to keep you waiting! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Kirito. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Looks like we have to leave everything
to Kirito inside. Let's hurry! </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yuna? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Dad stop all this! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> No, you're not yet Yuna. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I do not want to be turned on! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It's nothing more than the raw utterances
issued by the AI program. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Wait a minute. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Dad. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The data collection will be
submitted to the program. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> The last process will start immediately. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> That is his last assignment,
you've worked fine. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If Dad does a high-frequency scan
everyone can die here! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Be quiet, Yuna! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> In order to revive Yuna, I am willing
to sell my soul to the devil. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Though I... though I have to take the
same path with that guy. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I want to restore that time. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Not that easy yes? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Quickly search the surveillance camera and
find out where the person is. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> With this we will split up, Kikuoka. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Sorry I lost to a player. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> But we only have to do the last scan.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> With this, Yuna who will then... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yuna will... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> There is still a last task. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Submit your memories of Yuna! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Huh? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Eiji, you're the one closest to
Yuna so that's natural. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Now you have no business with him.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Not possible. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Do not you promise me I
can be with Yuna? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Goodbye. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yuna! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Kirito, help me. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If so keep everyone in here in danger.
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If the calculation of the frequency has reached
10,000 the scanning process will occur, </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> And it will have an impact on the brain! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Okay, everyone quickly release Augma!
</ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It would be dangerous if not removed! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> It's useless! All Bosses that appear in
previous events force players to fight! </ Font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> How then? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Where I pointed yesterday! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Quickly defeat the boss of the monster
that is there, Swordsman Black. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> That way... </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> I will release the Full Drive restriction
on Augma, get ready! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Augma can be used for Full Drive? </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Augma is a  Nerve Gear
whose performance is limited. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Now quickly go. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Okay! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Everything! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Let's do it. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yes. </ font>

it after two years. </ font>

<font color = "# ffff00"> Sorry, Asuna! </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You lost your memory because
the scan was done, </ font>

<font color = "# ffff00"> My dad raises the SAO Games boss to
give the SAO players fear. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> And run a high-voltage scan
on their brains. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Maybe it will cause
irreparable damage. </ font>

<font color = "# ffff00"> Mama. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> If I take it off, Kirito
will be saved. </ font>

the people he wants to save. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> Yuna, if you get killed in SAO, it must be
because you left the safe area. </ font>
<font color = "# ffff00"> You're trying to fight the monster
and try to finish the game. </ font>
