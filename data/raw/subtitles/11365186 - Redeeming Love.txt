Auntie Priscilla.

She was the meanest woman

She would make me cut
a fresh switch
from the tree in the front yard

So, one day,
she was out having tea
with her phony friends.
So I took an ax,
and I chopped the tree down.
It went through the house,
crushing her fancy-ass parlor.
(laughter)
Yeah.
God, I just wish
I had've stuck around
to see the look on Priss's face

Well, might not
