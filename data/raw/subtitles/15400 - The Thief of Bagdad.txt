THE THIEF OF BAGDAD
AN ARABIAN NIGHTS FANTASY
HAPPINESS MUST BE EARNED
Praise be to Allah- the Beneficent King-
The Creator of the Universe-
...Lord of the Three Worlds!
The Koran
Verily the works of those gone
before us have become
instances and examples to men
of our modern day,
that folk may view what admonishing chances
befel other folk and may there...
from take the warning.
INTRODUCTION TO THE ARABIAN NIGHTS
A street in Bagdad, dream city
of the ancient East...
If it be his purse, let
him tell what is in it.
'Tis empty.
The magic basket...
The magic rope of Ispahán...
...woven from a witch's hair in
the caverns of the Jinn.
Come to prayer! Come to prayer!
Come to prayer!
O true believers, gathered in...
...this sacred mosque,
earn thy happiness...
...in the name of the
true God...
Toil... for by toil the sweets
...of human life are found
Thou liest!
What I want - I take.
My reward is here.
Paradise is a fool's dream and Allah is a myth.
Honest citizens of Bagdad,
...here is a thief to be flogged.
Let all thieves beware! Four
and twenty lashes for the
stealing of this jewel.
Alms! O ye merciful!
Alms!
Rouse yourself, bird of evil.
I have brought home treasure.
It is a magic rope. With it we can
scale the highest walls.
In far eastern Asia, a Mongol Prince
in his...
...Palace at Ho Sho...
The Palace of the Caliph of Bagdad.
It shall be mine. What
I want - I take.
Celestial Majesty, at the next moon,
...suitors do go to Bagdad,
...seeking in marriage its royal Princess.
The gods of our dynasty
direct us.
We shall enter Bagdad
as a suitor.
Open wide the gates of Bagdad!
Open wide the gates of Bagdad!
We be porters bound for
 the Palace of the Caliph.
We bear gifts and viands to feast
the suitors who, on the tomorrow,
...come to woo our Princess.
Tonight - with the magic rope.
Beasts and scimitars
guard the Palace.
When night reaches
its noon...
The Princess sleeps.
The treasure-where is it?
'This here-
The melody of the oriental night
dies in the dawn.
And it is morning-.
It is the birthday of our Princess...
and royal suitors come from all the East
to seek her hand in marriage.
On the balcony of the Princess,
a slave girl reads a fortune-
The sands of Mecca
shape a rose.
This is the meaning:
Thou wilt wed the suitor who first
toucheth the rose-tree in thy garden.
'This here-
'This here-
Nizzy noodle!
He's turned love-bird.
She is a rare jewel, my love-bird.
Something beyond your reach,
 you prince of thieves.
Yet- once upon a time- a Princesa
was stolen from a Palace...
under the very eye of Harun-al-Rashid.
They found a way into the Palace
and, with a subtle drug, they...
...drowsed her and carrier her away.
The suitors are at the Palace gates.
The Prince of the Indies whose palace
is covered with an hundred thousand rubies.
He glowers. I like him not -
with all his rubies.
Allah grant he touch
not the rose-tree.
He touched not the rose-tree.
In the bazaars of the sleepy merchants,
thy nimble fingers can ...
...procure us princely raiment.
The Prince of Persia whose fathers
fought at Feyjoo...
...five hundred years ago.
He's fat and gross as if he fed on lard.
Praise Allah! He touched not the rose-tree.
The bazaars of the merchants...
Cham Shang the Great,
Prince of Mongols, King of Ho Sho...
...Governor of Wah Hoo
and the Island of Wak.
Bagdad is a mighty city.
Fail I to win the Princess,
it shall be mine by strategy.
O horrible! He chills
my blood with fear!
Ahmed, Prince of the Isles, of the
Seas, and of the Seven Palaces.
Ahmed, Prince of the Isles, of the
Seas, and of the Seven Palaces.
See how he rides - 
a Prince indeed!
'This he would make me happy. Allah
guide him to touch the rose.
Ahmed, Prince of the Isles, of the
Seas, and of the Seven Palaces.
There's no such rank nor title.
Celestial Majesty,
the superstition of the Princess...
...centers on that rose-tree.
Fail not to touch it.
How tragic, O Prince,
if you had been killed...
...and an end put to your
illustrious family.
We must make haste to steal her.
The Mongol pig suspect us.
Prince of the Isles and the Seas.
Behold! Allah foretold thee with a rose.
We must away from here.
'Twas wrong to come.
The Caliph awaits the suitors.
To possess Bagdad I have
now a two-fold reason.
In the Throne Room....
The Prince of the Indies...
The Prince of Persia.
The Prince of the Mongols...
The Just One, the Holy, the High-Born...
the Caliph of Bagdad.
The Princess, according to ancient custom
of our House...
...hath made her choice.
Let her ring be placed upon
the hand of the chosen.
He has not wed her yet.
My daughter's choice and heir
to the throne of Bagdad.
The word is said.
If any have protest, voice it now.
When the moon tips the cypress...
...the betrothal will be consummate in feast.
Come.
He is the thief who yesternight
did rob the Palace.
Desecration most foul, O mighty Caliph,
hath been wrought upon thy noble House!
This Ahmed is but a common thief.
This Ahmed who calls himself a Prince,
hunt him down!
I am not a Prince.
I am less than the slave who serves you..
a wretched outcast... a thief.
What i wanted, I took.
I wanted you... I tried to take you...
But, when I held you in my arms...
the very world did change.
The evil in me died.
I can bear a thousand tortures,
endure a thousand deaths...
but not thy tears.
This Arab Prince is but a thief.
Seek him out!
Quick! Hide thyself. If thou art
found with me, they will be merciless.
I love you.
Thou dog! What torments
can we devise for thee!
Flog him!
Fling him to the ape!
Let him be torn to pieces.
A pearl to every guard.
Have him placed in safety through
the secret panel into the streets.
She shall choose again.
The secret panel into the streets...
Choose! I command you.
I myself will make the choice.
Betray not the sands of Mecca.
Gain time. Defer the outcome.
Send them to distant lands to seek some rare treasure.
At the seventh moon let them return.
Who brings the rarest treasure I will wed.
When marriage plans have gone amiss,
The seventh moon betokens bliss.
Morning...
Come, if you still wouldst steal her.
I have found a way through
the tunnels of the tigers.
The Princes will return at the
seventh moon bearing treasure.
The one who brings the rarest wins the Princess.
Lose not thy hope, the rose persists,
and something good will come of this.
Turned lily-white he now goes
mewling to the mosque. Bah!
Thou art wounded.
In heart and soul.
I love a Princess.
Make thyself a Prince.
Allah hath made thy soul
to yearn for happiness...
...but thou must earn it.
Stay you in Bagdad.
I will send soldiers under guise
of porters bearing gifts.
Build me an army within the walls.
And so.. on the bedrock of humility
thou canst build any structure.
Come with me and I will set thy feet...
...on the path that leads to treasure
beyond thy dreams.
Three suitors leave thy city gate...
...But four are numbered in her fate.
At the end of the way is a silver chest...
...that doth contain the greatest magic.
Thou must be brave. Go now.
Control thy destiny.
Give this to her who hath
already my heart.
A day's journey from Bagdad...
a caravansary in the desert...
Thus far the three Princes
have traveled in company.
Great Lords of Asia,
good fortune to you...
...second only to mine own!
Let us meet here at the end
of the sixth moon.
Set spies to follow each.
A Defile in the Mountains
of Dread Adventure...
The Hermit of the Defile.
I seek a magic chest that
lies beyond this defile.
Knowest thou, rash youth...
devouring flames,
...foul monsters, shapes of death
beset the path?
A hundred years have I been here.
Many have gone this way
and none returned.
But, if thy resolve be firm,
I will help thee.
If thou dost reach the Cavern
of Enchanted Trees...
...touch with this talisman the midmost tree.
In Bagdad, the pavilion
of the Princess...
He too may return by the seventh moon.
... but his road is hard.
You must pray for him.
The first moon.
The Valley of Fire...
The second moon.
In search of rare treasure, The Persian Prince
came to the bazaars of Shiraz.
A crippled beggar knew a priceless secret.
The magic carpet.
They know not its value.
My Prince, here is
the greatest rarity in the world,
...the flying carpet.
The third moon.
The Valley of the Monsters.
The Cavern of the Enchanted Trees.
Thou hast shown great courage...
...but thy way is yet hard.
This is the chart to guide thee to
the Old Man of the Midnight Sea.
The fourth moon.
In search of rare treasure,
the Prince of the Indies...
...came to a forgotten idol
near Kandahar.
This is the greatest rarity in
the world, the magic crystal.
The fifth moon.
The Old Man of the
Midnight Sea.
At the bottom of the sea
is an iron-bound box.
There thou wilt find a star-shaped key.
Now you must climb to the
Abode of the Winged Horse.
That star-shaped key will
give you entrance here.
The Abode of the
Winged Horse...
The sixth moon.
In search of rare treasure,
the Prince of the Mongols...
...came to the Island of Wak.
A court magician knew
a secret shrine.
The magic apple...
That fisherman.
Far rarer than India's crystal
or Persia's carpet.
Thou wilt haste to Bagdad and,
at the end of
this sixth moon, give order
that the Prince be poisoned.
The Citadel of the Moon...
The magic chest is wrapped
in a cloak of invisibility.
The Cloak of Invisibility
and the Magic Chest...
At the end of the
sixth moon...
A day's journey from Bagdad..
again the caravansary in the desert.
Let us haste to Bagdad.
O Prince of the Indies,
discover this with the crystal.
...Does the Princess wait as she pledged?
Spread the flying carpet.
With the magic apple we
shall save her life.
The learned doctor,
Zakariya of Kufa.
Out of the clouds...
I was at the portals of death
and now I glow with health.
...What miracle is this?
I was I who brought you back.
No other gift can match
my golden apple.
He makes rash claim.
'Twas this rare crystal...
...disclosed your desperate plight.
My magic carpet brought us here.
By the beard of the Prophet,
it is rarest.
Her life belongs to me.
¡To me!
To me!
It is for me to decide
which gift is rarest.
A moment, O Princes!
Who can say which gift is rarest?
Without the crystal you
could not have known.
Without the carpet you could not have come.
...Without the apple you
could not have cured me.
Apple.. crystal.. carpet.
No one of them is rarest.
Each had been useless without
the other two.
Cease! There's wisdom here.
'Tis best that we deliberate.
Bide your time.
You have twenty thousand troops
within the walls.
Yourself hath said it.
'Tis best that we deliberate.
Through the night...
The Mongols are
taking the city!
Bagdad is yours!
The courier of the dawn...
We shall be wed at once.
Prepare thyself.
It is my command.
Bagdad is in the hands
of the Mongols.
You shall add joy to the wedding
festival by being boiled in oil.
Open wide the gates
of Bagdad!
Open wide the gates
of Bagdad!
Fly for your lives!
A great magician comes.
He summons armies from the earth itself!
A magic army, a hundred thousand
strong, surrounds the walls.
...Thy troops have fled.
Set my guard at
the Palace gates!
Open wide the gates
to our deliverer!
Great Khan, every way
of escape is blocked.
The flying carpet...
and the Princess.
Quick... the magic carpet.
I give thee gladly to
this great Prince.
HAPPINESS
MUST BE EARNED
