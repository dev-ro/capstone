(Radio announcement)
Darn you, Chauka!
This is all your fault.
Oh, right! There was a race track
here, an hour ago.
Why are you whining?
I'm driving here!
Obviously, you would.
You're almost a Sardaar.
Today, I'm driving on
the way back.
Keep dreaming.
When I am drunk,
I only trust myself.
And I trust Chauka,
just slightly more than that.
I Wouldn't even let you drive
sober.
Listen, I can drive drunk
better than both of you.
Have you lost it?
Are you planning
to fly over the traffic?
Are people in our country
fools?
As if the traffic will
clear just by honking your horn!
He's honking as if the other guy
doesn't want to move on!
I'm hereto settle down and
grow roots, right?
I've just decided I am going
to hold up the traffic and stay put.
Why are you hollering?
This is all your fault!
Yes, everything in your life
is my fault, right?
Don't mind him. He'll be still
saying the same when he has a kid!
This is all because of you!
Oh, man! Get a move on!
Okay.
Take the call, buddy.
Speak to aunt,
she must be getting hassled.
Forget about it!
She knows where I am.
But still, she has to
call every single day.
Sir. Your call.
Hey? Where? What?
Tell me, quick!
I can't see it!
Hurry up and tell me,
it's got to be Obama!
Please, tell me!
Awesome!
Loser, why don't you say it
loud enough so they can hear you?
We don't lech like you.
We are admirers.
You fools are going to
be admiring away all your life.
Chauke, the day we really
like some girl...
...and admiration is not enough
We'll go to talk to her.
We'll be loving, polite.
Then, the ball is in her court
Right, buddy?
Respect, Chauke.
I am more respectful than you!
I have never leched at
a girl so far.
When did you ever
look at girls?
You've been to an only
boys school.
Then, you did engineering
where there are hardly any girls.
And the girls who are there
and halfway decent to look at...
...they won't spare you
a second glance!
They are the ones who are
committed, from the word go!
Now, you're getting the third degree
in a 4 by 4 cubicle, every day.
Sure, why don't you
join the torture squad?
It's a free for all!
Join the club.
Free for all?
Isn't the company paying you?
Fool, my dad's hounding
me with his MBA chant.
They scam us big time!
In the tenth grade, they
said, just one more year.
Do that and they say just two
more years. Get through engineering.
Then, they start wailing
about the llTs!
Do the IIT graduates have
wings sprouting out of their backs?
Then, they say, fine, whatever.
Just get a placement.
You're settled! But, nothing doing.
Novv, they want me to do an MBA!
I've been working for four years, now!
I can't go back to school!
If we have relatives over,
there's more to stress out about.
His son joined this place,
his son is working in that place.
They all have a service
class, middle class mentality.
That reminds me.
I'm getting promoted.
An increment?
- About 30 percent.
God's justice is delayed
and denied, as well!
I do the legwork
and he gets promoted!
Better to have enemies
than a friend like you.
I'm a friend, but I'm human too.
It would hufl watching someone
like him get promoted.
Okay, fine. Congratulations.
Your increment is 30%, right?
You're buying the drinks from today.
What do you mean, from today?
When do you ever pay?
Did you forget who paid
for the snacks, day before?
Listen, I work hard for the money.
It's not diriy money, like yours!
You can get lost.
I won't spend a penny of my
dirty money of you.
You can used your hard
earned money for liquor.
Yes. And don't let the
loser drive the car, either.
Don't stress about that.
I'll drive.
What does that have to
do with the car?
It does. It's a hard earned car.
Either I or Chauka drive
my car, after drinking.
Because, he's almost
a Sardaar (Sikh).
Buddy, half a bottle can't
get the party going.
Shame on you!
We haven't even moved
out of the pub, yet.
The liquor will turn to water
if it hears you say that.
It's aged for 15 years in some
box in Europe.
And, it doesn't get the
party going, here!
If you can't get drunk,
have some water.
Why waste good money on it?
Listen, it's got to have
the feel, okay?
Sure, order Bisleri
for the right feel.
Why waste good liquor?
"I tell the bartender...
...I'm on a high, all night."
"Keep repeating my order."
"Just keep giving me
neat liquor."
"You can go home,
if you want to."
"Just do this for me."
"Just hand over the keys of
the cabinet to me."
"Just give me the keys. It's a one
on one with me and the liquor."
"No matter how much I hold back,
it won't let me be.'
"It's a one on one with
me and the liquor."
"No matter how much I hold back,
it won't let me be.'
"I just hate it."
"I am addicted to drink."
"Everyone tells me
to quit."
"This is the work of
the devil."
"Everyone drinks,
we just drink a little more."
"I just hate it."
"I am addicted to drink."
"Everyone tells me
to quit."
"This is the work of
the devil."
"Everyone will rise up."
"I won't give in."
"I will break the empty bottle."
"I won't turn away from
a drink."
"My friend lives in this alley."
"People love it here."
"I am going to drink
the bottle up."
"And still come back
for more."
"It's a one on one with
me and the liquor."
"No matter how much I hold back,
it won't let me be.'
"Yes, I do drink."
"It's the Worst thing to do."
"People just sip
on wine."
"I drink, till I lose my
bearings."
"You can go home,
if you want to."
"Just do this for me."
"Just hand over the keys of
the cabinet to me."
"It's a one on one with
me and the liquor."
"No matter how much I hold back,
it won't let me be.'
"It's a one on one with
me and the liquor."
"No matter how much I hold back,
it won't let me be.'
Come on, buddy.
Have you lost it?
We have better things to do.
Come on, please, bro.
Aren't you my brother?
We just have to stay
for an hour.
You can drink free liquor.
And you complain
that I don't get you drinks.
Yes, right. With uncle
and aunt in tow.
So, what are they going to do?
I'll be drinking, too.
Come on, buddy.
What will I do alone at the wedding?
You'll shake it.
What are you both
so busy with, anyway?
We didn't say We're busy.
There'll be girls, too!
What's the point of me
seeing girls from Meerut?
Imagine that they are
from Delhi and look.
I'll pass. You carry on.
If you find someone,
give her my number.
I'll come along.
But, in his car.
And I'm driving.
Are you 'm' insane?
Carry on with the toriure.
See if I come along, next time.
When it comes to you,
you just back off, completely!
You're just acting pricey
since I asked nicely.
And you! Just park that
car of yours, okay?
Come on, bro.
Please?
Chiku!
Oh, my God!
- Your sister-in-law.
Where are you going?
- To get me some Chiku.
I'm glad, you dumped him.
What?
The one you met by mistake.
I'm not available, now.
There's no chance of that, now.
Certainly not while I an": alive.
So, when are you planning
to die?
Right now. Almost there.
Yeah!
Cheers.
981...
"I941I"
â€œ.7038.
I forget stuff, when I drink.
I am not something
you can forget.
What do you think?
Will she forget?
Let's have a Patiala (drink).
There she is.
Priyanka is coming too.
F' riyanka!
Come on, make some for us, too.
Supriya. Kamal.
Hi.
- Siddhadh.
Hi.
- Hi.
Varun.
- Hi!
How do you want it?
- Half soda, half water.
Down the hatch!
Hurry up!
"Sister, your brother-in-law is
insane."
"Sister, your brother-in-law is
insane."
"Just look at him baiting
the girls!"
"Just look at him baiting
the girls!"
Yes, morn?
I'm on the way.
No,Sidhhar1h's...
I'm with Sidhhadh.
Yes, mom.
Bye. Okay.
I'm done.
You can carry on.
Sorry?
Oh, no.
You're misunderstanding.
I Wasn't ogling at you.
The trainer isn't here. So he asked
me to keep an eye on your form.
So, how was my form?
Well, running was 8 on 10.
I mean, it's a sure thing
that eloping...
...running isn't an issue
at all.
Abs, almost nine on ten.
But, I'd advise you
not to do that, too much.
Yes, you could have
a better back.
It's a 6 on 10, right now.
Especially at this young age.
You really need a strong back.
And squats and stretching?
10 on 10.
So, how do I get a ten on
ten in all?
It's not too difficult.
I can work on you...
yourform, till you get 10 on 10.
And what would you
charge for your services?
A coffee and a conversation?
Costa?
Five?
Do you want to pretend to
have a conversation?
Or, do you really want
to have a conversation?
How about seven?
My place?
So, are you going to
tell me your name, or...
Tarun.
Kusum.
Here you are.
Take a bitter mouthful.
Did you ever think,
it would come to this?
What happened?
- He found a girl in Meerut.
Are they getting you married?
What do you mean that?
I found her.
And she asked for my number.
She wanted to get her
data recovered.
That's just an excuse.
And why are you getting
so jealous, loser?
You should be happy for me.
Forget about him.
You tell me.
How did you score?
You won't believe it!
I was in great shape, yesterday.
For a moment, I thought she was
ogling me, more than I ogled her.
First, I was boozing with the boys
and she came with her friend.
Then, when I noticed her a bit,
she began to smile.
I met her, even while
I was dancing.
I mean, we danced to the
wedding song...
...it was like a reel life
moment.
Did you ask her, properly?
Whether she's distantly
related to you in some way.
Desperate boys often slip up
like that in weddings.
You be quiet.
She's not related, okay?
She was coming to Noida.
So, I said, you don't have to
go alone. I'll drop you home.
It's not safe, you know?
Protection? So you did it from
the point of view of protection?
Then, did you get her to tie a rakhi
and promise to protect her forever?
Gogo, let it go.
This is serious.
So, did you get the hard
disk, while you were at it?
'M' you! You're getting
to be just like him.
You can't bear to see me happy.
It's not my fault,
you're not getting any!
The house seems like prison
to me.
It's good, I have Supriya, now.
I was thinking, there's no point
in wasting time with you guys.
I remember all the stuff
dad used to say about you.
Listen, we are happy.
Novv, tell me more.
Well, she's coming home
at 4 pm.
To our house?
- Yes, loser! To our house.
The girl calls me up
at 10 am in the morning.
She said, hi, this is Supriya.
Remember me, from last night?
Supriya. Sounds so sweet
just to say it.
It feels as if, Ms. Lata
has sung a ballad.
"It feels, as if...
- Alright, zip it. It's a very sweet name."
Don't get addicted to the sugar
or you'll get diabetes.
So, tell me.
Did you get a call?
Not yet.
- Which call is he expecting?
He's not lagging
too far behind.
He ceriainly gave his number.
Didn't he tell you?
I see, so that's it!
How can that loser
tell me about it?
I've set up for a date
and he didn't even get a call!
No wonder! He's up early on a
Sunday and touching that phone...
was if Katrina Kaif is about
to pop out of it!
And that's why you're
so jealous, loser!
You didn't get a call, and you're
calling my girl, my sister!
Listen, guys like you who pass out
their numbers are a dime a dozen.
Girls don't call up
just like that.
You can take that from me in
writing, you won't get any calls!
Hello?
- I was just checking.
Are you dead yet?
- I was saved.
By me?
- No. By Kiwi and Litchi.
Their names are Ruchi and Tina.
Those are really boring names.
I like a name like Chiku.
Full of juice.
So juicy!
So, what's your name?
Fruity?
Ansh u I.
Get it tattooed.
I've heard, you're
prone to forgetting.
Do you forget to have dinner
or do you forget that too?
Le Bistro Du Pare?
See you at 7?
- See you.
So, brothers.
There's no hard disk,
there's no data.
No data recovery, either!
When a boy and girl schedule
a meeting without any agenda...
...it's called a date.
Awesome, my boy.
You've saved my image.
So, Chauka, you were
saying something to me.
Buddy, let's clean up quickly.
Let's book you a ticket.
- For what?
He's going on a date, too.
Obviously, you'll watch a movie.
Or are you going to be wandering
aimlessly outside the house?
I'm not going anywhere.
Clean this mess up,
and get out of here, quietly!
Your sister-in-Iaw will be here
at 4 pm.
I've got a date at 7 pm!
Why must I leave so early?
Gogo, don't kill me, now.
Aren't you my brother? Don't
I clear out, when you have company?
You would have to leave.
You seem to forget the
lease is in my name.
So, that's what it's come to
now.
You had to say that to me.
I called her over, since I thought
it's my house.
Alright.
I was mistaken.
_ Hey' "q
Cut the melodrama.
Back off! I'm leaving,
since you called me brother.
Go for any reason,
but, just go!
Then, I'll tie you a rakhi
and get a tattoo saying...
...that you are my brother.
Oh, hi.
Come in.
Hi.
Really sorry, the house
is in such a mess.
Actually, my friends stay with me,
I just stepped in, just now.
Oh. I see.
Will you have something? Cause,
this is going to take some time.
I can order a pizza.
I don't mind some water.
Sure, I'll get it.
Please, make yourself comforiable.
- Okay.
Water?
Can I touch it to my lips?
More?
No, thanks.
- Okay.
So, you work at a call center?
BPO.
- BPO.
Excuse me.
Happy anniversary, sir!
This is not mine. Sorry,
you've the wrong address.
Mr. Siddharth?
- Yes?
It's for you, sir.
Happy Anniversary to
Mr. Siddharih and Ms. Supriya...
It's not mine, buddy!
Why don't you just wait for a bit?
Listen, it's not mine.
I didn't place any order.
It's a gift for you, sir.
Listen, I told you.
Take this away.
We don't want it.
It's paid, sir.
I can't take it back.
'M' 'm' did you order it?
Yes, what's the score,
my brother?
Did you open the account yet?
'M' give the phone to Thakur.
Two, please.
- Did sister-in-law like the flowers?
Thakur, what is this 'm'?
You can't do stuff like that!
It's okay for us, why make the
poor girl feel uncomforiable?
Uncomfortable? Darn you, you
threw rne out of my own house.
And you want her to feel
comfortable'?
Get lost, you gl-IYS!
Get lost, it seems.
- Get lost, is it?
Supriya, I'm really sorry.
This...
...my friends Gogo and
Thakur were just kidding...
It's okay.
(Didi tera devar deewana
phone ringtone)
Yes, brother.
Is the ring tone alright?
Yes, it's fine.
Listen, just come back home.
Okay, enjoy yourself.
That was the last of it.
Oh, my. So, you told
them that, too?
Well, actually...
Are you going to give me
some wine, or...
Hi.
Thank you.
You're quite beautiful,
actually.
I mean, I know love at first sight
is a pretty useless concept.
But, it's possible with you.
I'm not saying that I am,
though.
So, don't get me wrong.
But, it could happen with you.
So I am.
How many hours did you think
and prepare to get that line right?
Why don't you hit me with
the line you rejected?
Oh!
Okay, let's hear the one
which was the least bad.
You know, what was my favorite
fruit as a kid?
And?
You can't be here.
You have to leave.
Why?
- Outside eatables not allowed.
Ruchika.
The name is Ruchika.
Oh, my God, that
name is a flashback to the 70s.
It's a nice name!
Excuse me.
- Yes.
Can you get me a Chiku soup?
Sorry, sir.
I don't have that.
Chiku salad?
- Sorry, sir.
I am sure, you have some
Chiku halwa! - Sorry, sir.
If I knew you're an engineer...
...I promise you, you Wouldn't
have stood a chance.
Nobody is as boring
as an engineer.
Give us engineers
one chance and see.
No. Engineers are boring.
Well, at least you don't look
like an engineer.
Why? What do engineers
look like?
Like uncles.
Like your uncle?
No, just uncles in general.
Okay, how much do I owe
you for the wine?
Oh, it's okay.
No Tarun, it's not okay.
How much for that?
And this is not boring?
It's a non negotiable for me.
I'll take it.
Let me salvage the image of
the engineers, first.
What's so interesting about you?
"The machines of my head
are in motion..."
"...now that, I have seen
her branded walk."
"All my Wicked, lazy desires...
mare excited by the glow
on her face."
"The machines of my head
are in motion..."
"...now that, I have seen
her branded walk."
"All my Wicked, lazy desires...
mare excited by the glow
on her face."
"All the girls, and so many
of them around...
...yet, I've given up
chasing them."
"Let the word get out,
fill the pages of newspapers...
...with all the writeups."
"The Ioverboys' heads...
...now, belong to Paro."
"The Ioverboys' heads...
...now, belong to Paro."
"Paro in the town."
"Her shiny stole is sheer poison,
while her eyes are brown."
"Pam's tattoo shimmers."
'It's a piece of diamond."
"You look full on desi,
my love..."
...but, you've got an
international attitude."
"Pam's tattoo shimmers."
'It's a piece of diamond."
"You look full on desi,
my love..."
...but, you've got an
international attitude."
"Take a little break
and look into my eyes."
"I am a fan of
your charms."
"The fever is rising higher
and...
...now, the Ioverboys are
afflicted with love!"
"The Ioverboys' heads...
"The Ioverboys' heads...
...now, belong to Paro."
"The Ioverboys' heads...
...now, belong to Paro."
Good morning.
It's certainly good for you.
What's the matter with him?
- He's going to meet his mom-in-Iaw.
When did that happen?
Loser, you have to leave
the room to know what happened.
Did she inform the family?
- I guess, she'll tell them today.
Or, who knows? She may
have already told them.
She said, she wants me to meet
her parents.
When are you going to
tell your family?
I will have to do that, soon.
Who knows? Aunt might bring
the marriage topic to the table.
Besides, her family is
rather old fashioned.
There are no issues at my
place. But still...
Yes, right. Why should you
have any issues?
It's not as if you listen
to anyone.
You can just send your dad
an invite.
So, what about your
kitty party'?
Tonight.
But, I'm leaving now.
I have to take Chiku
and Ruchi to the nail spa.
Are you going to
apply the nail polish?
The landlady is sleeping.
Did you make the tea, Mr. Thakur?
- He did.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
And we drank it, too.
So, We're leaving.
Wait up. Where are you going.
Sit.
He's going for FiuchPs birthday
party.
And this man here is going to
meet his mom-in-Iaw.
Really?
- No, I'm just meeting her, casually.
Let's all meet up together,
once.
I mean, us, Chiku, Supriya.
I also want to meet them.
Yes, of course.
Let's have dinner tomorrow
after the match.
I was saying same to Tarun.
Yes.
Let's go.
Bye.
Just see about the rent.
Sharma called up.
I'll pay tomorrow.
Don't you all split?
The rent? We do.
- Yes.
I mean, we don't do the math
for every little thing, but...
I just think, every little
thing may seem trivial...
...but, food, petrol, electricity...
...all of that just adds
up, right?
Don't worry about it.
It's open.
Hello, aunt.
- Hello.
Hey!
Come in, Siddharih!
Aunt.
What is this?
- What is what?
You should have brought
the wedding procession!
What do you mean?
Why are you all dolled up?
Supriya, you told me to come
home to meet your parents.
Siddharih, I said, come home.
If my parents are around,
you can meet them, too.
What do you mean?
- Siddhadh!
You're here like any of
my other friends.
As a friend.
I thought...
- Siddharih, please understand.
I can't take the risk of
them saying no.
I want them to get to
know you first.
They should star-t liking you.
And, then I will tell them
at the right time.
Yes.
Come along, meet my friends.
Hi!
That's Siddhadh.
- Hey, hi. What's up?
I'm waiting in the car!
I won't wait on the road!
What pillow?
- Just a moment, sir.
Why do you need a moment?
- She'll be here. - A black car...
Walk towards it, then!
- She's on the phone.
Look at her. There she is.
Ruchi I can't see you.
Okay, I see you!
There she comes.
Where did she go?
Gogo, tell me. Whose nails
are better?
Gage?
Cheating!
Gage?
Look at them.
- Chiku, they're nice.
Really?
- Yes.
I hate them. I specifically
told her, perivvinkle blue.
She ruined my style on purpose.
But she said, it'll get like that
when it dries up.
No, it won't. I'm a 110 % sure
it just won't happen.
See, Gogo? Do you think
this will match perivvinkle blue?
Chiku, where's my phone?
I don't know.
- Oh, no.
Give me a call!
Check your bags.
My nails are wet, Gogo.
- Her nails are wet, Gogo!
No, no, no!
Tina!
- Tina!
Oh!
Gogo, you check.
Take a look!
- Make a call!
Yes, Chiku!
- Make the call.
Chiku!
What's happening?
It's ringing.
It must be on silent mode.
It's not vibrating either.
It's in silent mode, Gogo!
Let's go back.
Chiku, I'm going to stop
for a bit and check.
No, I'm sure I left it back there.
Let's go back!
Gogo, let's turn back!
- Yes, Chiku!
Gogo, turn back!
- Yes, Chiku, I need to get to a U-turn!
We need to get to a U-turn.
When is the U-turn
expected to turn up?
Where's everybody else?
Aunt, they have a shift today.
- I see.
Uncle, this is Siddharih.
- Hello, uncle.
I haven't seen you before.
Uncle, I...
- Uncle, he doesn't have any time.
We keep asking him to meet up.
What do you do, son?
I work in TCS,
as a software engineer. - Oh.
He repaired sister's
hard drive from the wedding.
Really?
Thank you.
We were Worried about that.
Your printer is not working
either, right?
Can you take a look, son?
- Yes, aunt.
Right now?
Eat your food, first.
- Okay.
The rice, son?
- No, that's enough, thank you.
Pass me the rice!
Supriya's dad will eat some.
Don't you think, when uncle
and aunt will find out later...
...they will be all the more
upset that you lied?
Siddharih! I know my parents.
It's difficult for them to
accept that I'm dating someone.
Specially for dad.
My family isn't like
your family.
If dad finds out,
I'll be doomed.
I will have to
quit working and socializing.
Do you trust me?
Absolutely.
I'm so excited!
- Hey.
Baby.
- It's my...
What happened?
No one loves me!
I love you, Tina.
I love you.
I also love you, right?
Tina, I love you.
See? Anshu also
loves you.
I love you, too!
I'll drive.
- Yes, Tina'll drive.
Baby! Baby!
Baby, she's drunk.
I'm not drunk!
Do you think I'm drunk?
I'm not drunk.
I love being a queen.
Dance! It's her birthday!
- Yeah.
Watch it, watch out
for the side! - Awesome!
Baby is in trouble!
- Baby is in trouble!
Sunny!
- Sunny!
Happy Birthday, Fiuchi!
Thank you, Sunny!
- Sunny, say hi to Anshu!
Hi, Anshu!
- Hey!
No, no, no, no!
Oh, no!
Hi!
- Hello.
You're shameless. Four overs
are done.
Don't blame him, Sid.
We got held up at the car garage.
See?
He retired.
Yeah, Gogo?
- Yeah, baby.
What happened?
- Sachin retired.
What about the car?
- Nothing much. Just a bit...
Sid, you won't believe what
happened yesterday.
Tina was so drunk, she
completely passed out.
And when Tina drinks drinks...
...then I don't think
anyone can stop her.
Right, Gogo?
Yes.
Then what?
Then, Tina wanted to drive.
She said, give me the keys.
Then, what?
Then, Gogo couldn't refuse.
I mean, it was FiuchPs
birthday!
And we were all so high!
Right, Gogo?
Yes, I mean, since it was
her birthday, so... - Yes.
I mean, you won't believe
how fast we drove!
Really? We touched 110,
I think.
Or was it 120, Gogo?
It was around 70, I think.
No, Gogo!
How would you know?
We were in the back seat.
Tina told me, it was 120.
But, Sid, despite the speed,
nothing happened.
And you know when we banged?
When, Gogo?
While parking.
I mean, isn't that hilarious?
Nothing happened
the whole way...
...and we got hit while parking!
How silly!
Very silly.
Yeah! Match.
Chauka (Four runs)!
Chauka!
Chauka!
Chauka!
Chauka!
- Yes!
Alright, they will win, easily.
I'll see you tonight?
Where?
- At the club.
Tina told you in the morning.
Aren't we all going for
dinner, today?
I told you, remember?
Yeah, right.
I forgot.
Cool. See you guys.
I'll drop you.
- No, no.
I have a driver.
Bye.
Bye.
- I could still drop you.
She'll go. Gogo.
See you.
You don't let me so much as
touch the keys after drinking!
And Tina was burning the tires at
120 since it was Ruchi's birihday!
While you were romancing
in the back seat!
He can let drunk women
drive the car.
But, even if I have a hangover,
I take a rickshaw.
He doesn't care for anyone.
I tell you, let's pack his
stuff up...
...and toss him out of our
house, at this very moment.
What's your problem, fool?
He lets you drive it.
And our house? You seem to
forget I signed the lease.
Loser, I am not fighting for
myself. I'm not selfish like you.
I am fighting for the rights of all
friends, who have friends like him.
But, you won't get it.
You're useless, loser!
He's totally pathetic, man!
If a man can be late for an India
Pakistan match, he's lost to us.
Look at me! On principle, I haven't
missed a single toss!
The World may turn topsy turvy.
Some rules in your life aren't
broken for anyone.
It may be your parents, your
boss, the best of friends.
YES, 3 up riya?
Yes, S up riya.
Yes, S up riya.
Yes, S up riya.
Supriya and her mom
want to go to Gaffer market.
They want to buy a printer.
Six runs!
Yes.
Yes, Sidhharih chose a printer.
It's nice.
It's the perfect price.
Should I buy it?
Alright.
Please pack this.
- Okay, ma'am.
Shall we leave, aunt?
Yes, there is a dress shop
next door. Let's go there.
Who does she think she is?
Cold milk and chocos!
Shall we go?
- Already?
Let's have another round
of the same.
I have a shift, actually.
Call center?
BPO.
Forget about it.
What do you mean by that?
What is she trying to prove?
That We're all cheap?
I didn't say anything, because of
you and your equation with Tarun.
Otherwise, I'd buy the restaurant
and hit her in the face with it.
Witch!
We're splitting, right?
It's o...
It's okay.
No, Tarun, it's not okay.
We'll split. It's not on you.
I'll take it later from you.
Here.
It's okay.
I will tell Goga and Chauka
about each one's share.
Right.
- It's okay.
Why did you have to do that?
- What do you mean?
Why are you getting into it?
Goga, Chauka and I have
our own equation.
And why are you even getting
into money matters?
Why? Because I'm a girl...
...that's why, I'm not supposed to
get into money matters?
Tarun, I don't agree with it.
I did what I thought was right.
Yes, you could have done
that later.
Why did you involve
everyone in it?
I didn't involve everyone.
I said, I'm splitting.
Now, it's up to then": if they
feel guilty...
...that after I an": saying it,
they got their cards out'?
That's bound to happen,
if you insult everyone.
Who did I insult?
I did what I always do!
And I won't be apologetic
about it.
You know, this has
always mattered to me.
It's non negotiable for me.
I am not forcing anyone.
But I will not participate
in this exploitation...
...in the name of friendship.
And if you have any
problem, then, fine!
I won't go out with
your friends.
Anyways, I barely know them.
Kusum.
- Just decide.
Am I the kind of girl you want in
your life, who speaks her mind?
Or an": I too uncomfortable
for your world'?
Call me, when you are sure.
Thakur, come in, Thakur.
Thaku r.
Yes.
What did the landlady say?
What did Chiku say?
She said, she'd buy the restaurant
and hit her in the face with it.
You whine over the cost of
a plate of snacks, fool!
Supriya seemed quite upset.
That's just the way she looks.
Don't think too hard.
She is new to our lives.
She'll need some
time to figure it out.
Those who really care say things
that make people uncomforiable.
Otherwise, why should she care'?
Girls have to feel
that their boyfriends...
msuppori their ways
and methods.
Take the call, support her.
I'll do it later, fool.
It's not like you. We have
an understanding.
We understand each other
without a word being said.
Thanks for not picking up
my phone.
I've understood, I will never
bother you again.
Bye.
Over and out.
Understood, what?
Anshu, I've realized.
Chiku, what have
you realized?
That I am better off alone.
- What?
Anshu, no! I've decided.
Decided what, baby?
That I don't need you all.
I can be happy alone,
I don't need anyone.
Chiku, baby.
You all think, I'm dependent
on you'll.
I won't be able to live
without any of you.
That is so wrong!
I don't need any one of you.
At least tell me what happened?
I clearly told Ruchi, we can't
go out clubbing today.
But, we can go tomorrow.
So, how is that my fault?
Did you ask me before making
the dinner plan with Kusum?
But, I told you, right?
- See? You told me.
Why should I change my life
as per you people?
Why should I snuff out every
one of my wishes for all of you?
I wanted to go clubbing
and they went without me!
I didn't want to go out
for dinner.
But, I had to go for Kusum.
I went there and was told me
and my boyfriend are cheap.
I am sorry, baby.
Of course, you can't
live your life for anyone else.
Who's it?
- Ruchi.
Do not pick her call!
Chiku!
- You want to take her call?
Fine, you go to her.
Don't even mention that witch!
She ruined your mood!
I don't even want to look at her.
Damn right, you won't.
I won't speak to her
and neither will you.
You know what?
Text her.
Text her, right now.
What you did today...
No.
After what you did to Chiku
today...
...don't ever expect me
to talk to you again.
Ever. Like, never.
Ever, ever.
Write that, Gogo!
Sent.
- Good.
The dinner bill.
Please, pay it on time,
it's a non negotiable.
Yes, Supriya'?
- It's mom's birthday, today.
Buy a cake.
Pick me up after the shift.
Yes, S up riya.
Your mom's birthday!
Wish her first of all
in the morning.
Don't forget.
Save a reminder.
I thought, I'd come up now...
It will look odd if you come
up at this time.
Pink? Pink, pink, pink,
pink, pink!
No, Anshu!
Concentrate!
Salmon pink, old rose pink.
Carnation pink, hot pink.
Magenta pink.
Come, now We'll choose reds.
Looks nice, right?
Hey, what's the matter?
- It's too expensive.
Tarun, I told you, I didn't
want you to buy it.
Can't I get you a gift?
Promise me, no expensive
gifts, after this?
Yes, sure.
So, is it done?
Yes, uncle. Almost done.
- Dad.
What is it?
- Nothing.
Hi!
Is the patch up done?
You tried to make sure it
didn't, but it is done!
Let's go out.
Your choice. It'll be my treat.
Don't forget to take it
from me.
Why don't you buy a new one?
I am saving up for an iPhone.
I just have to use this for another
couple of months.
Tarun, I am not taking this.
Seriously.
Grey or silver, sir?
- Gold.
Thank you.
When will you tell them?
I will tell them when
the time is right.
Cheers!
- Cheers.
Yeah, baby.
You were just waiting to drop me
and go back to your friends, right?
Yeah, baby. No, baby!
It's been two hours
since you dropped me home.
You still haven't called me.
Yeah, baby.
- No, baby.
You know, sometimes I feel
one must have a credit card.
What if you need cash suddenly?
What if you have to buy
something, online?
I've applied twice.
I just can't get it.
I can get you an add on
on my card.
No!
Seriously, no.
Yes, uncle.
- I hit the 1 billion lottery!
I got an email.
- The 1 billion lottery?
Who sent you the email?
It's from Coco Cola, Germany.
Uncle, actually, that's
a scam. Everyone gets that.
What do you mean by that?
I got it, there must be something
to it. - Right, uncle.
Come home at once.
- Yes, right away, uncle.
I told my mom about us.
She likes you.
What are you trying to tell me
by saying that?
I am just telling you that
I told morn...
Do you know how guilty I feel?
You think, I don't want
to tell them.
I never said that.
Do you trust me?
Isn't this dress a bit
too revealing?
Typical boyfriend!
Anshu, please.
I know you think I am dumb.
But, just because you're my
boyfriend that doesn't mean...
mthat you are going to teach
me how to dress.
Such a rip off!
I told you, it's overpriced
and not value for the money.
And the food's so not worth it.
Next time, you want to burn up
some cash, give it to me.
I make better food at home.
Anshu, your facebook status
is still single.
You don't want to tell people
you're with me?
I don't even remember the last
time I logged in on Facebook.
And you're talking about
my status!
It's just Chiku's status is
committed in a relationship.
And your status is single.
Don't you think it's weird?
Yes, it is.
- Yes, it is?
Don't you know we are together?
Yes, but what's the problem with
changing the status?
Tell me the password.
Let me Iogin.
You don't trust Chiku?
Don't ask me, again.
Dobara (Again).
Mat Poochna (Don't ask).
So, guys, the demo
for the Nextel is on.
They are coming over at 7:30 pm
tomorrow evening.
Check the UI thoroughly,
one last time in the morning.
Okay?
Tarun, it will be really
great for us...
...if you could attend
this meeting.
Even after office hours.
Yeah.
Hello?
- Good morning.
Urgent?
- What?
Is it something urgent?
I mean, I just...
- I'll call you.
What are you doing?
- You come here.
Sit down here.
Look at this.
Put these on the side.
And this aswell.
Uncle, we have to create
a profile, after signing up.
Then, do it.
- For whom?
For her.
For Supriya, who else
do you think?
Hi! When did you arrive?
Dad called him.
We wanted to check the matrimonial
website on the internet.
Father's name.
You know that.
Height.
- Well...
Five six.
Put that in.
And weight?
58.
Put that in.
Complexion?
- Fair.
No, very fair.
Drink, no.
Smoke, no.
The profile is ready.
Star-t looking for boys.
I was going to tell you.
But, you thought, I am not
ready.
Siddharih, please.
Don't stress me out
any more, right now.
Seriously? I find out from
your parents, just by chance...
...that they are scouting for
boys for you and you are stressed!
I am 25!
At this age, all the parents
star-t looking.
And it's not like, they know
I have a boyfriend.
They are bound to look, right?
- What does that mean?
They aren't going to tell themselves
that!
I know, Siddhar-th, but...
...the point is, that it
is complicated now.
How can I tell them suddenly
after you are so close to them?
They'll feel cheated.
Now, they will feel worse that
you always had bad intentions.
What is that supposed to mean?
I want to marry you!
Since when is that
a bad intention?
Siddharih, you may or may
not believe it...
...but I want to marry
you, too.
Sup riya.
I'll be there.
I was calling you.
Anything urgent?
Baby, I was a bit stressed out
due to work at that time.
Yes.
The boss is hounding me
these days.
Tarun, that's what a boss
is meant to do.
At least, you should
have listened to me.
I'm sorry.
It was something urgent.
- What was it?
It's done, now.
Okay, but what was it?
What can you do about it now?
It's all done.
Still, tell me.
Why?
Oh, you want to know, since you
don't believe it was urgent.
No! Anyways,
forget about it.
It's done, right?
So what?
No, Tarun.
That's not the point.
You always act as if you
are the only one who works.
Kusum, they pay me 300,000 a
month!
You don't...
- Okay, so say what you mean.
Your job is more impodant
since you earn more than me.
What about me? I earn
just 50,000!
So of course, I can spare time
for you.
My work doesn't really matter.
Baby, all I am saying is that
the higher the salary...
...the more employers
expect from you.
I am doing this for both of us.
But, I can't help it.
I am under pressure.
On top of that, my boss
doesn't like me.
I'm just sick of this job.
Then, why are you doing it?
Quit!
It's not like I
haven't thought of it.
But, it's not so easy.
We need it.
And we have to plan a lot.
I am doing that.
But, it will take some time.
I've planned to star-t
something on my own.
But, first I have to set
up the base.
I have to create some security.
Okay?
Yes.
Hi.
- Who's Neha?
She was my ex-girlfriend.
We never discussed her,
so there was nothing to tell.
I never thought about
deleting the mails.
So, do you still read them?
Here, let me delete them.
All done?
Happy, now?
Happy?
I'm not so shallow.
So, this is why you
didn't change your status!
While she is single, you
can't change your own.
You've already changed it.
And you logged into
my mail, too.
You know it's not right.
Did I say anything about it?
Logging in is such a cardinal
sin!
We aren't even talking about
what I found after logging in!
I am so sorry!
Please change your password.
Change it for Gmail, too.
You'll have to change it for
Skype, Yahoo, everything!
Neha, what is this...
Did you just call me Neha?
What?
What did you just say?
I said, the topic about
Neha is done, right?
Don't you lie to me!
You stored those lousy mails,
you called me Neha!
And then, you're lying to me.
Baby, I just mixed up 2 sentences
in a hurry, I swear!
It was just a casual
relationship with her.
You're so insensitive!
No wonder she left you.
Chiku, she didn't leave me.
We had a...
...Why are we talking about her?
Do you still miss her?
What do you want from me?
Should I get her to talk
to you?
I'm sorry, I dated someone
else before you.
I didn't know that I was going
to date Chiku at some point.
If I knew, I Wouldn't have
dated anyone else.
How many other girlfriends
are you in touch with on Facebook?
And, we are back!
There is no one else, my lady!
Neha and I aren't in
touch, either.
Please, trust me.
Don't you talk to me
about trust.
I found the mails in your account
and you called me Neha.
Baby, why don't you just
delete my account?
Yes, so you can reactivate
it, in case we break up.
How did you manage to make
this about our breakup?
Since when is Facebook
so important?
Post your picture
on my profile.
Send yourself public
messages from my account.
About how much I love you!
Why are you so hassled
about a casual relationship?
Do you think, I'm
that desperate?
You're going to say that about
me to your next girlfriend, right?
Casual relationship?
I was just having fun?
Baby. I love you.
And how will I say it since
there won't be anyone after you?
Because, I am not going
to let you go.
Do you even know
why I called you?
It was because of Neha.
No! See?
That's what you think of me!
I called because...
...Ruchi is going back home
for 2 weeks.
So, the house is going to be empty.
You can come and live
with me, if you wish.
But, now I think I am
going to ask Tina.
No baby, why call Tina?
I'm still around!
No, Gogo. Just let it be.
Don't do this, Chiku!
I am sorry, Chiku!
I love you, baby.
Do you know, I've prayed
so hard for this very day?
I wanted Ruchi to go home!
I made so many plans!
Just like girls plan
for their honeymoon.
Exactly like that.
You can't survive without
Chauka and Thakur.
Without whom?
Chauka and Thakur!
Chauka and Thakur, Who?
Yes.
I just hope those fools
hate me.
Which fools?
The three fools?
The boy's family.
- Which boy's family?
The people who came
home on Sunday.
I told dad.
How much I hated the way...
- The boy's family came to meet you?
The boy's parents came over.
It was a general first meeting.
Are you kidding me?
Why did you tell me so soon?
Why not on the wedding day?
Well, I did tell you.
- After meeting them.
Siddharih, I told you myself.
I could have hid this from you.
Besides, you don't have to behave
as if you don't know anything.
How would I know?
Who created the profile?
- Your dad strong-armed me into it.
Dad is looking at profiles.
So, obviously the boy's
family is going to come to meet me.
What is so astounding about that?
So, do the horoscopes match?
The wedding date is set
and the invites have been printed.
It's just another boy.
Don't mind it. You can officiate
as the priest.
What's all this about
waiting for the perfect time?
Is she going to release
a rocket to Mars?
Is she consulting an astrologer
about when to tell her family?
Should I call the astrologer
and have an oblation?
What is up?
Seriously, don't they get it?
I mean, I'm a young boy
with a good job...
...and I have quit boozing and
my friends to languish at your home.
Obviously, it's for their
daughter.
Why else should I want to change
bulbs and mend printers?
It's not as if he's Bill Gates and
I love grocery shopping for him.
What do I get out of it'? I have
parents, they have birthdays.
Do they, by some chance
feel, that...
...an orphan child is looking
for his parents, through them?
No, come on!
Once uncle asked me.
About my dad's profession.
I figured, I had hit the jackpot!
Then, he tells me, if your
dad needs insurance let me know.
I have a friend, who is an
agent.
So, even if I go ahead
and say it...
...uncle, Supriya and I are
going to elope, he won't listen.
He will say, really? Pay the
power bill, as you leave.
Is the Tata website networking?
- What?
The power website.
'M', it's an expression.
It's a way of saying it.
He's not actually
going to say that.
Who's listening to you, anyway?
Both my cards were declined.
How should I know?
Check the statement, 'm'!
Am I under contract to do
odd jobs for every family?
I didn't pay a bill at my place.
All of you have turned into a maid!
All that's left is cleaning loos and
they are going to ask for that, too!
Sid, the maid hasn't come home.
Can you come over?
Listen, pick up some toilet
cleaner on the way. Son, son, son.
This says it's maxed out.
The second one is
maxed out too!
You never know where the
money goes, these days.
Have dinner out and you
spend 2000 to 2500 easily.
In that case, I have to have dinner
thrice a day to max out my card.
What's the limit?
Both together amount to
620,000.
Hey, kiddo! Did you break
the bed, or just your back?
Don't ask.
My will is shattered.
Cry. Let it all out.
It's a night for tears.
I went there, thrilled to bits.
I thought, I'd give
Chiku a tiny surprise.
Catch me!
Anshu! What are you doing?
Sunny!
I thought, you'd catch me.
- Oh!
Oh, my cutie pie fell down!
Where does it huri?
That witch!
Who?
- Shruti!
Who?
Sunny's girlfriend, Anshu!
Ex.
I just don't get it. How can
any girl leave Sunny?
He's been crying for
two weeks straight.
Since his parents were hassled
in Chandigarh, he came to Delhi.
He checked into a hotel
since Tina told him of our plans.
I said, are you insane?
Me and Anshu can
do this, anytime!
Should we take care of him,
rather than have fun?
I dragged him out of there
and got him to check out.
How can I leave him alone
when he needs a friend, right?
Right.
I knew you'll understand.
Okay, listen.
I don't think, your being here
will help him.
You saw it, right?
You and I will only remind
him of him and Shruti.
I love you.
- I love you, too.
So, let's say Chiku is
your want and Sunny's need.
So, technically, this is alright.
How can girls manage to have
boys for best friends?
Have you ever heard of me
being a girl's best friend?
Or, does Thakur have a female
BFF he chatters with on the phone?
Who are these boys,
we don't see?
Where do they hide? When
do they meet? What do they do?
I mean, look at a boy and
tell me...
...how can he become
a girl's best friend?
They look like us and move
amongst us, too.
All it takes is just
one heartbreak.
After that, they cry like girls.
Then, the girls feel
sorry for them.
Then, sympathy,
empathy and sensitivity.
They become girls
and cling to the girls.
Babes! I was thinking...
- Yes?
...I simply hate seeing you do
something you don't want to.
Yes?
- But, I understand.
So, I've got a plan.
We're going to star-t saving,
okay?
Yes? - Tomorrow, I'm opening
us a joint account.
We will save 20% of each our salaries
in it, every month.
And this we won't touch
at all. Okay?
Yes.
- This is like our future money.
Like our first step towards
our future, okay?
Good plan, baby.
Isn't it? I knew it. Okay,
I'll talk to you later.
I'll do some research on which bank
offers the best interest rate.
Good night baby, love you!
I know what 20% from you
would be. What about her?
20% of my 20%.
A man's mind is meant to
absorb the knowledge of the world.
But, some fools use it to
absorb a woman's nonsense.
If you squeeze the mind of a man
in a relationship, you will find...
...you will find a bucketful
of nonsense.
That amount of nonsense...
...is enough to make you
sick. Infect, very sick.
My name is Chauka.
I have been in a relationship
for the past year.
I have lost my mind,
since I have been in a relationship.
I have stopped breathing.
I don't think,
I can live for too long.
You know, Tarun,
we were discussing something serious.
But, I don't think
he heard a Word.
He was just staring at me
all the time.
I was so frustrated! I was like,
at least listen to me, first.
Then, I'll stand up for 5 minutes
and you can get an eyeful.
Don't forget to take
it from me.
You know, they use organic veggies.
It's really good for health.
I think, we should star-t
that at home, too.
I mean, they are expensive.
But so much healthier and
like, more natural, right?
Kusum, I have decided.
I am quitting my job.
I've thought a lot about it.
There will never be a right time.
This is the time.
The later it gets, the more I will
get caught up in all of it.
Then, it will be too tough
to get out of it.
And the market's right.
I have a good feeling about this.
We will have a bit of a money
crunch for the first few months.
Nothing too serious.
I have planned for it.
But, from now on, let's
control our expenses.
We can cut back
on everything, you know...
You think, I should take
the metro to work?
What?
No, I just thought,
it's not that bad.
A lot of people travel by it.
I'm talking about
the externals.
How much can you
save on traveling?
Yeah.
Yes. You're right!
Tarun, I am going to make
a budget.
And We'll spend strictly
according to that for everything.
Big, small, food, petrol,
everything.
In fact, let's forget about
the organic stuff for now.
Let's eat normal food.
We have been doing
that, so far.
And these people? Rs. 600
for a salad!
Waste of money.
I'm not talking about this.
- Be quiet, Tarun.
You're not alone in this.
I'm doing it, because I want to.
I'm doing it for us.
(Commentary)
Hey.
Now, you look like my Sunny.
It's a one day match, right?
Not live. Sachin's greatest
innings show.
Change it.
- Do it.
Good evening and
welcome to Comedy Nights.
Sir?
- Yes
Anyways, Sachin is over rated.
Yes, Sunny doesn't like Sachin.
Right, Sunny?
The fool plays only for himself.
What are you saying?
Look at his record.
Yes, he has so many hundreds!
But, India never wins
when he scores a hundred.
Never? I mean, check
the record.
I also don't like Sachin.
I like Kohli!
Do you know, when he was born
he's mother was in this hopital,
but he entered
from a different hopital.
Sir.
If you guys going to seat
together by yourselves
I'll go to the market
and get some vegetables.
- Baby, sugar?
- One spoon.
Sir, he has a pocket full of insults.
Whenever you try to talk to him
immediately he goes,
here is an insult for you and for you.
Tell him. Tell him something about me.
What kind of a person I am.
- Yeah sure.
Yeah. Friends!
Thank you, sweetie.
Here.
The buffalo goes in the water.
- So why don't you also go in then.
Everybody (flap!
Tell me! Which color?
No!
- Tell me!
Pink.
Baby pink, or...
Liar! It's got an orange strap.
Be quiet, Sunny!
You're not supposed to listen!
You should be sulking.
What will it take for you
sit quietly?
It's been an hour.
She said, she'd tell him she's not
interested in marriage in 10 minutes.
Does it take so long
to say one little thing?
2 hours. You said, it would take
15 minutes.
My girlfriend is at a coffee shop,
while I sit 20 feet away...
...watching her arrange her wedding
and this is what you can think of?
Fool, I'm sitting here with you.
Whereas, my ovvn girlfriend is
watching a movie with Sunny.
I even booked the
tickets for the show!
The rascal can go for movies
and dinner.
Doesn't he see other couples
out there?
But, when he sees
me and Chiku, he acts as if...
...he'll drown in his sorrows
and die.
And the next time we go husband
hunting for your girlfriend...
...let's find an AC joint.
Talk to Chiku, and
convince her.
Wow! I swear, you should be
the Love Guru on the radio.
You're paying for this one,
fool.
Why? Won't you pay for the
muffin you stuffed down your face?
Oh, sorry, you even pay
for Sunny's diapers, now.
Get lost!
- Why didn't you get the finger bowl?
'M', which coffee shops hand
out finger bowls?
This one will hand them
out from today.
No.
I think, the horoscopes match.
It appears, all aspects are
in harmony.
Sister-in-law looks so happy!
Now, she's going to leave, only
after planning their family.
What the 'm' is this?
Is this any way to
reject a boy's proposal?
Where are they off to?
She texted, Pankaj will drop me home.
Don't wait for me.
'M'! What kind of a name
is Pankaj?
It sounds alright to me.
Now, he asked
where I was going.
I told him, I'm going home.
So, he said, come,
I'll drop you.
Tell me, what was I going
to say?
No, it's fine.
I'll manage.
He Wasn't bad, you know?
He has studied in the US
and settled dovvn over there.
He's ideal husband material.
What do you think about him?
Siddharth?
What's the matter?
Supriya...
- Siddhadh...
...you have to trust me.
Honestly? Right now I don't!
What is the matter?
- The matter is that I'm a 'm'!
I make a girl's
matrimonial profile.
I go to meet her future
husband with her!
Just chill! She's just meeting
the boy.
It's not as if that implies, she is
going to marry him.
If she can leave you high
and dry, while dating you...
...give her enough credit that she
can do it to the other guy as well.
'M', she can do whatever she
Wants! I don't want any more coffee!
I don't like coffee!
Why should I drink coffee?
Pankaj wants to meet the girl
where he likes.
Why should I spend my
money to drink coffee?
Your money, fool?
What kind of a name is Pankaj?
Thakur, I'm thinking...
...I'm going to take Chiku on some
foreign holiday next weekend.
Take her, or send
her with Sunny?
You guys can bring Supriya
and Kusum along too.
It will be like a relationship
spa type of thing.
Yes, 'm'. I'm 'm' quitting the job
and you want to go abroad!
That too, with the girls
in tow!
My girl is loaded. And she
has her own credit card.
And in case you boys forgot...
...this is our first first date
anniversary for all of us.
Oh, my! Calendar boy, you're
rocking the kitty party, now.
Fool, I reminded you.
Or I'm going to be the one patching
you up when you take a hit.
That's not a bad idea.
It'll be a two day break
from the family circus.
Where can we go?
Anywhere. Let's ask the
ladies about the rest.
Are you insane?
They might just plan
their own holidays.
They may end up going to
three separate locations.
I'll talk to Supriya
about a holiday, once.
We have a good rapport
And sisters-in-law listen to
their brothers-in-law.
Baby, Gogo and Chauka are planning
a holiday with Chiku and Supriya.
I think, we are frustrated since
we don't have quality time together.
Okay, how's Sunny doing, now?
Still depressed?
You know these things
take time, right?
But, he's better than before.
You know, he's coming
to the gym also!
Really? Wow!
I know, you've been saying
I can't spare any time for you.
And I know you're right.
Baby, she is going to be
with Thakur!
We have decided once we get
there, we are going to stay apart
It's been so long since
we had any time together.
And now that Sunny is
also feeling better...
...and it's our first first date
anniversary, too.
And I really wanted our first
one to be extra special.
How could you imagine
that I would forget?
Of course, baby. We so need
a holiday!
Where are we going?
- Let's go to Krabi. Done.
"Let me write a story
about myself...
msurreptiously
on your body."
"I'll hide away your shadow."
"Then, the World will search
for us."
"I've given up everything
to ask for you."
"I've given up everything
to ask for you."
"I don't belong to myself,
anymore."
"My love, you're my love."
"My love, you're my love."
"My love, you're my love."
"My love, you're my love."
"To lose myself, in your dreams."
"That's how much I love you."
"I could be pad of your story...
...if you just say the Word."
"I've forgotten everything,
to be with you."
"I've forgotten everything,
to be with you."
"You are my passion."
"My love, you're my love."
"My love, you're my love."
"My love, you're my love."
"My love, you're my love."
Kusum.
- Yes?
I have given my notice
at the office.
What do you mean?
I mean, I am going to quit my job.
Already?
Yes, I told you, right?
What is it?
You made it sound like you
would quit after some months.
I didn't make it sound
like anything.
Don't I get to have
any say in this?
Of course, you have a say
in it, Kusum!
Then, wait.
Don't do it.
I have already handed
in my notice.
So, I don't have a say.
Siddhadh! What is it?
Are you seriously expecting
me to answer that?
I took you along with me,
to meet him.
I tell you everything
that I do.
I lied to my parents to
come here with you.
And I am sitting with you,
right now.
But, you have ignored all of
that and all you can see is...
mthat, he sent me an srns.
Sunny, wait a moment.
Anshu, say hi to Sunny.
Hi.
Happy first, first date
anniversary, buddy.
AVVW!
Did you eat?
Did you go to the gym?
F' rotei n shakes?
Did you meet Tina?
You knew I'm planning
my website.
I told you, I'm quitting
my job.
You could have told me
then, that I... - Where's the plan?
Where is the model?
Where is the research?
Some ground work has been done.
And, that's why I handed in
my notice. I will do all this now.
So, that isn't called a plan!
Are you going to plan, now?
And anyways, do whatever
you want to.
But, don't ask me, when my
opinion obviously doesn't matter.
Why did you tell me to save
money?
Why did you tell me
to make a budget?
Why did you tell me to
monitor expenses?
You wanted to do that!
Right.
I am your assistant, right?
Please?
It's our first holiday.
Let's not spoil it.
Siddharih!
I know we are on a holiday.
And it's the first time
we are staying together.
But, I don't want to do
some things, yet.
You know?
No! I don't know.
What are you saying?
It's not as if we are marrying
after 4 years. We can wait.
You again...
- I'm just being polite.
Should I star-t ignoring it'?
No. Carry on with the srns game.
Siddharih!
This is not gossip, Sunny!
Oh, come on! It's Tina.
This is...
Mute it for a moment.
Hold on, one second.
When are we going for lunch?
We're quite late.
Let's order in.
This is why we came here
on a holiday.
So we could spend some
time together.
If we had to have an anniversary
lunch with Sunny...
...we could have stayed
back there.
Anshu! It's Sunny.
He's my best friend.
And me?
Who am I?
Sunny, wait one second.
- I thought, you had...
Why will I mute it?
What's wrong if he hears it?
Sunny, be quiet for one moment.
Unfreaking-believeable!
I told you to wait!
Sisters-in-law listen to
brothers-in-law.
Tell me, if he was talking
to you on such a holiday...
...would I mind?
Tell me.
You came here, just now, right?
Do you think, I would refuse to let
him go with you, if he were here?
He sends me 10 srns.
Then, I reply to one.
You tell me. Should
I ignore him?
What if dad finds out?
Won't he have doubts?
I am just Worried about him.
I will help him.
There's you, there's Chauka.
I really think, he's taking
a hasty decision.
I never enjoyed
watching the match.
I could see that you
knew that, even then.
Only Anshu and Tarun
didn't know.
So, I sat through
India's batting innings, right?
It is a big deal to lie
to my family and come here.
You are his best friend, right?
Talk to him.
That it is such a silly
decision!
I'm going Whack him.
Why are you crying?
Wait, let him get here. I'll slap him.
I will talk to him.
He gets upset really quickly.
Okay, wipe your tears.
The landlady can cry, too!
Oh, my! Don't get so
stressed out.
I'm here. Don't worry.
She is just a bit concerned
about you.
She cares for you.
It's not her fault, you don't
have a girl for a best friend.
Why don't you trust
sister-in-law?
Yes, u ncle?
Come home at once.
Dress up well.
It's important.
Okay, uncle.
This is Siddharih.
He is Supriya's friend.
But, you could
consider him as our son.
Offer him something to eat.
So, he's like an adopted
brother.
Well, it's implied that
he is a brother.
I have decided
how I will tell dad.
Siddharih!
Dad didn't say yes
to them, yet.
And I said, I will tell him...
- Don't tell him!
It's not the right time, yet.
Siddhadh...
- Listen, just marry him.
Are you crazy?
- Uncle is ready to get you married.
But, he is not willing
to hear about me.
What kind of 'm' up thing is that?
- Don't talk to me in this language.
Listen, you decide whether
you want to tell him or not.
When, how and which
language will you use.
Just call me, when you have
told him.
Siddharih! I didn't agree
to the wedding.
Siddharih!
Isn't she up, yet?
Good morning.
- Good morning.
You're up late, today.
Ah.
Amazing! Sunny not at home!
Hey, man.
Why was he in your bedroom?
What?
Did he sleep with you?
Yes, so what?
We went off to sleep
while chatting at night.
Sunny. Will you give us
five minutes?
Yes, sure.
I'll be in the bedroom.
If a person was sleepy
while chatting...
...then the other person could
have slept in the other room.
Enough, Anshu.
I am not even going to dignify
this with a discussion.
A boy slept with you
in your bed.
And you're telling me
you won't dignify that...
...with an answer?
Stop making it sound
like I slept with him!
He's my best friend.
I have had enough of this
best friend charade.
What is wrong with you?
He's my childhood friend.
If I was interested in him,
why would I even date you?
Alright, so he's your best buddy
since childhood.
But, there is a relationship,
right?
If he is more impodant
than me then why am I here?
And your childhood is past you.
There is a time for everything,
when things seem right.
He may have wrestled with you
as a kid.
Will he do that even now?
No, right?
What is it? Is everything
alright?
No, everything is not alright.
Anshu, don't talk to him
in this tone.
Leave him out of this, this is
our problem.
Right, this is our problem.
We. Do you understand
what that means?
What is the matter?
Just tell me.
He's upset, that we slept
together.
Oh, no, Anshu!
You know, there is nothing
of that son going on.
We are just good friends.
You should trust Chiku
at least that much.
Exactly!
Seriously, don't you get it?
Or you guys just playing dumb?
Forget about the trust!
There is a difference between
being trusting and a cuckold!
Do whatever you want and then
expect me, in the name of trust...
...not to have
any issues with that.
I'm seriously done with this.
You can elope, if you want.
We won't stop you.
You shouldn't have told
them so soon.
You should have taken
some more time.
We didn't wait for
the right time.
Revealing stuff too quickly
can cause problems.
Do you think, if we had waited
longer, they would believe us?
What do you want from me?
Oh! I'm asking for too much!
I am so sorry!
I know, you told uncle...
...and he didn't listen.
So, what can you do about it?
It's not all that simple.
You know, it doesn't seem so
when I look at you.
It doesn't seem like
you mind, too much.
The way you're giving up
so easily...
...it doesn't seem like it ever
mattered to you.
Do you think, it's easy for me?
Alright, then. I'll talk to uncle
again.
No, you're not going to do that.
It can't be done.
I know, it won't happen.
I always knew it.
I don't know why I loved you.
I have ruined your life, too.
I am sorry.
- You are sorry?
Great! What else could I want?
Siddharih! You should understand me.
What should I understand?
Where should I shove that apology?
What should I do with that?
After one and a half year, you
realize you shouldn't have done it.
That it was a mistake!
What should I do
with that apology?
By God.
I've never felt so ***
up.
And mind you, I already felt
I was pretty 'm' up, anyway.
But, not like this.
Go away.
Go!
I know, you're avoiding me.
I tried not to tell you.
But, I am two weeks late.
I am really nervous Tarun.
And now?
- This was negative too.
But, these tests are not
too reliable.
Yes, but, all five tests can't
be wrong.
How do you know, Tarun?
Are you pregnant, or me?
I am saying, you could be
late, due to stress.
I read on the net,
it's quite common.
Were you hoping,
I'm not pregnant?
Weren't you hoping
for that, too?
Yes. Perhaps.
I guess.
But, I don't know.
For a moment, I thought
this is right.
I was nervous too, but
in a good way.
Didn't you feel like that?
Kusum, what is this sudden...
What if the test was positive?
We would have discussed that
in that scenario.
What do you mean?
Imagine, I am pregnant.
In that case, I am with you
no matter what you decide.
Tarun!
I don't know, Tarun.
I just feel, I am ready
to be a mother.
But, a while ago, that thought
was scaring you.
I was scared at the thought of
being alone.
But, now that you are here
I felt it can be done.
L-lere is the partnership deed.
l-lave a look at it.
Chauke, did you see that?
The boy is doing accounts, now.
Losers, don't fool yourselves.
I am the boss.
Yes, you are, but...
Then, take my signature
and do the job, like employees do.
You are talking nonsense.
Did you transfer the money?
I'll get it done, by tomorrow.
The money can be arranged.
Just read it once.
Gogo, I tell you, this guy has
hatched an evil plan.
He's into ownership of everything
these days.
That's what happens
when a girl is in your life.
I just don't get it!
What's the problem?
The problem? The fact that
she is a girl is the problem!
What else could be a problem?
The problem is we don't
want any problems in life.
But, if we don't have any
problems in life...
...then, that is the biggest
problem of their lives.
Basically, there is a time
in every girl's life...
...when she realizes that
now her life...
...is impossible without
a driver, a bodyguard...
...a servant or an ATM.
Every girl can't
afford all of those things, right?
So, girls look for boyfriends.
They try you out. If they
like your work...
...then, the job is permanent
and you get married.
The most impodant thing about
marriage is fulfilling needs.
And men are supposed to
fulfill a woman's every need.
You barely finish paperwork after
losing a job and the girl vanishes.
The office folks don't ask
for the ID card as quickly...
was they ask for a divorce!
Basically, if a girl has to
pay once, she vanishes.
Their purses contain the
legendary vanishing Watch.
Just wear it and vanish.
If you really want to pay,
then, pay!
Don't pretend like
you want to pay.
Don't pay as per the amount of
the bill, pay every single time.
Listen, girls just pretend to give
up in front of parents.
It's never going to happen
that you're earning 200,000...
...and she gets pressured into
marrying someone who makes 50,000.
She fights her parents only
so long...
was they can find a boy
to compare with you.
Then, she won't just break up
and go away from your life.
She will discuss the why and
wherefores for ten days.
Suddenly, she will be Worried about
whether you've eaten.
If you are so concerned,
why leave him?
Basically, what they want is...
...for you to ask whether she ate,
so she can say no.
Then, you will request her to
eat and she will cry.
It will be established, that the
breakup due to their 'm'...
...has her featuring
as the greatest victim, too!
All of them are selfish!
Just take the girl from
the Titanic, for example.
Let's say one person could
fit on the wooden plank.
Why didn't they do 15 minute
rotations?
Alright, you clambered
on, first.
Who told to climb and go
to sleep?
She slept to her head's
content.
How did you declare
that he is dead?
Are you a doctor?
Did you check his pulse?
He could have fainted.
He didn't say good morning
baby, so he's dead.
She tossed him overboard
and went off.
They want to talk before sleeping,
after sleeping...
...isn't the day enough? Can't a man
rest in peace, before sleeping?
And what is this talk
me to sleep bit?
Let's say, I would even do that
to get her to sleep...
...but, what happens while
sleeping at night...
...that, they want to star-t talking
as soon as they wake up?
Baby, it's been an hour,
you didn't call me.
I need an hour, just to wake
myself up.
Then, you go to the loo, brush
your teeth.
You think about the day ahead.
Every man has a fundamental right
to think in the loo!
But, no! They want to talk
to you, even over there.
Why do married men always
get late to the office?
Because, the ones who get up
on time, get late, due to talking.
And the smart guys get up late.
So, it's wake up, get ready
and run!
You just don't want
to have to talk.
And after putting up with
all that...
...their biggest 'm' is...
...they want to talk after
intimacy, too!
Are you insane? Intercourse is what
it is, because it's the ultimate.
Why is the climax so called?
Because that's the end of the film!
VVho on earth eats soup
after eating dessert?
You know, sometimes, I think they
want you to talk them to orgasm.
Girls only need two things
from men.
I love you and sorry.
If you say I love you, they ask
you why do you love me?
They want to know after every
two months, why do you love me?
Yeah, I love you, but give me
five reasons why you love me.
Are you crazy?
Whoever thinks so much?
Didn't you ever hear that love is
a feeling?
And the biggest 'm' of all
is sorry.
Because, eventually, every man
gets tired and has to say sorry.
But, it doesn't end after saying
sorry.
The real story starts after
saying sorry.
Do you know, why you
said sorry?
You don't even know
why you said sorry!
I am saying sorry about
what we are arguing about.
Try explaining to them, but no way!
They won't get it.
Just let their best friend
explain the same thing...
...they understand it in
a trice!
Suraj Barjatya started this
nonsense about best friends.
The best friend scam is
perpetuated...
...with lines like, no sorry or
thanks in friendship.
Sir, we don't say please
to friends, we don't ask...
...and there is no limit
to anything!
When it comes to friendship
a boy can come to a girl's house...
...and stay as long
as he Wants.
A girl can sit in her friend's
lap, and it's platonic.
A girl can get drunk and kiss
her friend, and it's platonic.
A girl can change in front of her
friend, that's okay too.
I guess, even intimacy is platonic
between friends.
Say one word about their
clothes...
...and suddenly, they
behave like feminists.
You can't tell me what to Wear.
If you can tell me what I can
wear...
...how does my telling
you, suddenly...
...bring equality, liberty,
individuality...
â€œfreedom, sovereignty
into the mix?
And the phone is the Worst
enemy of a man.
See, there is a stage in
every relationship...
...when you know, while talking
on the phone...
...that, this conversation will blow
up into a fight after a point.
But, you can't disconnect.
Because, girls don't think you
should have disconnect buttons.
They can disconnect, as it
is their right.
Or, they want to watch
Masterchef. But, not you!
Because, Air-tel is now...
...here to torture you on the phone
as well as the I V!
Record the match and watch
it later.
Women can be convinced that is
a genuine proposition.
Which self respecting man records a
match to watch it later?
Earlier, the service providers slashed
call rates and destroyed us.
When they were done,
the smart phone guys showed up.
Novv, tell me why do you need
to create an app...
...which tells someone
about your location?
I stop to buy a cigarette
on the road...
...and I get a call at once.
Baby, are you fine?
No, I saw you standing somewhere
since 3 and a half minutes.
I figured, I should call
and ask you.
Woman, if I call you so many
times, while driving...
...I am going to die,
anyways!
Even if a man is dying...
...he will probably have
to call and tell her.
Baby, I'm dying! The God
of death is here for me.
Even then they won't bother
that the man is dying.
They will still ask, where
are you, how are you dying?
You didn't tell me you had plans to
die, today!
Who is dying with you?
Really? So, now you're
dying with him too?
That's how Sati got her husband
back from the God of Death.
She must have 'm' his happiness.
She must have bombarded
him with questions.
I bet, the Lord of Death handed
the husband back with an apology.
For one thing, girls say
they love surprises.
Whereas the fact is that
women hate surprises.
They just love the opportunity
to pretend to be surprised.
They should know you
have planned a surprise.
They should know what
you have planned.
But, not through you!
Through someone else.
Then, their real joy is concealed
within the fact that...
...that they may know the
surprise...
...but you have to go up to them
and yell surprise...
...and give them a chance
to say, aww!
Every question they ask
is coated with another question.
There are layers.
You may think she is asking you
how the chickpeas taste.
If you like them, that's okay.
But, God forbid, you find
some flaws...
...then, the recipe will be
one passed down by her mom.
And if you don't like chickpeas
made by her mom's recipe...
mthat means, you hate
her entire family.
Why do girls feel that their
'parents are Gods incarnate?
You can only learn something
of value from her parents.
And she can mouth off about
your parents, it's totally cool.
You can't say a sentence
against them.
They will wage the 3rd and 4th
World war, at once.
You can call my mom
manipulative, that's no biggie.
If I call your mom slightly
touchy...
...she gets so touched, you can't
touch her for weeks on end!
Despite all of that,
we are with girls.
And those who aren't
are desperately seeing girls.
Why? Because they bribe us.
Bribe is an institution
started by women.
Because, the bribes they can
offer, will never end.
And we bribe takers are getting
ruined, by the minute...
...won't it better to get married
to one's own hand'?
I am getting relieved from
the office, next week.
The engagement is in the
first week of March.
I will get married
after three months.
I will leave, at once
after the wedding.
I don't want to marry him.
I don't want to.
I don't want to.
I love you,Siddhar1h.
I love you.
I know, I can't have
you for life.
But, till I can...
...I want to.
I want to.
I think, I will have to withdraw the
savings from our account.
I can't support the
website, without that.
That's going to happen, if you
keep spending on Anshul and Chauka.
Kusum, there you go again!
Why discuss it, when you don't
know the understanding between us?
If there is such a
deep understanding...
...Why don't you ask them
for the money?
Anyway, it's your money.
It's your career.
Take your half from the account.
My half? I thought that
is our money.
So you want to use up
all the savings?
Kusum, I am talking about
withdrawing the money...
...that I would have saved for
my website, anyways.
Oh! Now, I get it.
I thought, we were saving equal
portions of our salaries.
We are investing equally.
But I didn't realize, you are keeping
track of the contributions.
Kusum, I am not keeping track
of anything. I need your support
I am sorry, Tarun.
I am not able to suppod
you, financially.
Support isn't only financial,
Kusurn.
You have to support
in some way.
At least don't be so negative
if you can't be supportive.
What do you want me to say?
It's a great idea?
It is a successful business
plan?
You're going to become
Mark Zuckerberg with this website!
Foolish!
Sunny has gone.
So?
We need to talk.
Can you come home?
I know, you have had
problems about Sunny.
But, you should know, he
kept telling me...
...that, you are right.
And I should examine it from
your perspective...
...and then any boyfriend
can be uncomfortable.
I know. What we do without Sunny?
Stop being sarcastic.
He's gone, now.
I'm leaving, then.
Stay here.
Please?
I know, you left because of me.
I am sorry.
Are you crazy?
Chill.
I need you to understand.
Even if Anshu is here,
you're still impodant to me.
I know.
You know, how important
you are to me'?
I am going to talk to him.
He'll have to understand.
When you were here, I felt
there is someone with me.
Since you've gone, I feel
so alone!
I know. Me too!
I miss you.
I miss you, too.
He's sleeping right next to me.
He may wake up.
Good night. Sweet dreams.
Sweet d reams.
"Oh, you fool!"
"For how long?"
"Oh, you fool!"
"For how long?"
"Why didn't you accept what
you figured out, you fool?"
"You fool!"
"You fool!"
"Oh, you fool!"
"The bird pecked at your harvest and
pooped on you, for good measure."
"Your wretched decency has
messed up your life."
"You are left
standing, high and dry."
"You are left
standing, high and dry."
"She used you to climb
and then walked all over you.'
"Run away!
You are so lucky!"
"Run away!
You are so lucky."
"Why are you lying unaware,
in the grave you have dug?"
"This romance of yours
is a cesspool of lies."
"Accept it!
Wake up!"
"Get a move on!
Run away!"
"You are truly caught."
"When will you wisen up?"
"You fool...
Hi.
Hi.
Who were you speaking to?
What?
I was calling and there
was call waiting.
Who were you talking to?
To Tina!
Let me see your phone.
- What the 'm'?
Don't worry, I will understand.
I will have to understand, right?
You checked my phone!
How dare you?
Is that such a cardinal sin?
We aren't even talking about
what was in the phone!
Did he hug you while sleeping?
What? Seriously?
What kind of a question is that?
Were you snuggled up in
the same comforier?
How will knowing
that, help you, Anshu?
I don't know, I just want to know.
'M' off! Seriously, 'm' off.
Don't forget to tell her
how much you hate me.
Anshu, just let it go!
Forget it.
I would have done it,
if I could.
I left my phone behind.
I told you, he's not worth it.
How dare he ask you this?
That is really cheap!
Why do you take so much
nonsense, Chiku?
You're better than this, Why do
you let him treat you like this?
Siddharih, I have decided.
I want to marry you.
Listen, court marriage is overnight,
only in movies.
In reality, there's a whole lot
of rigmarole involved.
You have to apply.
You can't go there in the morning
and get married on the spot.
Anyways, you better
think this over.
Let's see in the morning.
You handle Supriya.
Hello?
- Yes, Kusum?
Are you with Tarun?
No.
What the 'm' are you guys
teaching him?
Why are you both doing this?
I know, you are tutoring him.
He's blinded.
He can't see how
he is ruining his life.
But, can't you see it either?
And you call yourself friends.
You know...
...I have discussed this idea
even with my boss.
And what he had to say?
That Tarun is being childish.
He's talking like a child,
okay?
He doesn't value anything that
I say.
But, if someone so senior said that,
obviously something is wrong.
I am telling you.
I will not be a pad
of this, seriously.
If he wants to ruin his
life in this way...
...then, I have no interest in
being a pad of such a life.
I am not going to ruin my life,
for his insanity.
Supriya!
Supriya!
Supriya!
Supriya!
Supriya!
Supriya!
Uncle says, Supriya
came here for a party.
We forced her.
We spiked her drink.
Thakur, this is such
a load of nonsense.
Tell him to ask her directly.
The girl is agreeing
to all her dad is saying.
Sir, she came home at night.
She asked him to marry her,
in my presence.
Sir, we were there.
It's true.
Listen, buddy, you know
that and I know that.
The girl knows, the Inspector knows
and her dad knows.
She came of her own free will.
But, I have never seen
it in 20 years of duty.
No girl tells the truth here.
Often, they back off.
Do you want to move on, or
give a warning and settle it?
You know the truth and so do I.
She is agreeing with you
right now.
What if she backs off in the
coufl?
Forget about the court
Since it has come to this,
it is going to become public.
I will speak too.
The truth will emerge.
What will Pankaj think?
So, let's forget about it.
I can guarantee this...
...you can marry her off, happily.
I won't see her again.
And of course,
thank you for saving me.
If I had married her,
I would have been 'm'.
Siddhaflh, I...
You're such a liar!
This is the account closing form.
I have signed it.
What is it?
Did Gogo talk to you?
No. Why?
Did you say anything to him?
No.
I am closing this account as well.
Is it about the money?
Yes. It is about the money.
Tarun, forget what I said.
You can withdraw all
the money from the account.
I didn't know that...
...the money would become such
a huge deal.
That is what I find
really surprising.
You just didn't know it.
I would have convinced
myself, if you did know.
There was something missing.
The intentions
weren't good enough.
But, you didn't know.
And since I know how much you
hate taking favors from others...
...just thought, I would let
you know.
You owe me 850,000.
App roximately.
Sorry.
I know, you are angry.
But, just let it go, please?
We are good together.
I love you.
Say that again.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you, Tina!
I love you, Anshu!
I love you!
I love you!
- I love you!
I love you!
- I love you!
I love you!
- I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
I told you, he's not worth it.
How dare he ask you this?
How cheap is that?
Why do you take so much
nonsense, Chiku?
You're better than this, why
do you let him treat you like this?
He absolutely doesn't trust me.
It's always the same thing.
Like I slept with Sunny,
till the end.
See? I told you, Sunny
likes you.
He even liked you before
dating that girl.
He still likes you.
I never understood...
...what you saw in Anshu.
Yes, but...
- But, what?
Tell me, what does Anshu have
that Sunny doesn't?
Who understands you better?
Sunny.
Who have you known
for a longer time?
Sunny.
Who cares for you more?
Sunny.
Who doesn't care for
you, at all?
Who is rude to you?
Who makes you cry?
Anshu!
I don't know why I am with him.
I just don't know.
I don't know anything.
Do you think, I should break
up with him?
It's your call.
But, I feel bad to see you...
I love you.
These three words
are so cheap and fake.
Anyone can write them
up, at any place.
Anyone can say them to anyone.
You can forget them
at any time...
I love you.
Yes, morn? Hello.
How are you?
- Listen, I am telling you.
A mother's love...
- I'm with Gogo and Thakur.
...Is the greatest love of all.
- Alright.
How do these moms do it?
- Are you well?
Meerut?
- Without asking for anything.
Without wanting anything.
- How did that happen?
Unconditional.
- Meerut is a nice place.
I am going now.
I've had too much to drink.
Hello, Mom?
- Meerut?
Nothing, just missing you.
- Oh, there.
I love you.
- Yes.
I am not drunk.
- I am not going anywhere.
Okay.
- Just wanted to say it.
I didn't break up! No way.
- It's nothing.
All well.
- I just wanted to say it.
I don't need money.
And, so tell me more.
No, I am not drinking.
- Okay.
I won't eat. Don't worry.
- I am just about to drink.
Stop scolding me.
- Yes.
What was he saying?
- I just love you, mom.
He won't be coming, right?
- I miss you.
Nothing.
He said, it would be after two months.
- Just like that.
No, I'm coming.
No, there's no hassle.
- I will be coming next week.
Yes, baby! Sorry, yeah Gogo.
Don't blame him, Sid.
The car was late...
We checked into the
hotel, because...
Sorry. I forgot the next line.
What is the dialogue?
Basically, if the girl has
to pay...
...the purse vanishes.
It goes away.
Where is he going?
On whose shoulder is he crying?
If you lean against their shoulder
you will be be...
Even after the marriage...
But...
Action.
One moment, something
went into my eye.
There's no water.
- No one said tring.
Sorry.
- Cut.
I mean, she...
Oh, no.
A man who can't be there
for India Pakistan...
Oh, no!
Sir, I don't know
what is going on.
Ask S up riya.
Cut. Action.
- Sorry again.
I won't do it again.
- I am saying no.
You can't...
Is it a successful
business plan?
It's a great success...
Sir, he laughs!
No, I'm just saying...
Sports doesn't help
financially, Kusurn.
Kusum...
- Cut.
Gage and Chauka...
~ Gage and Chauka...
Gaga and Chaga!
