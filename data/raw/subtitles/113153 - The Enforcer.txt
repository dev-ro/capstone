Let's eat dumplings today,
how about dumplings?
Great!
Mom, why daddy
hasn't come back yet?
Don't worry, he's received your
letter, he will come back.
The 18th Youth Martial Arts
Competition now starts.
I'll be back soon.
Let's stop here.
Boss, that's Kung Wei.
20 minutes late!
Not anyone shows up!
Let's wait for a while!
Someone will come.
Are you fooling me?
Who is going to fool you?
I promised my son
to watch his competition.
You bastard! You have many excuses!
Alright, I am bastard.
If that guy doesn't show up 5
minutes later, let's forget the deal.
Are you the boss?
You have to listen to me.
Why should you go back
to watch your son's competition?
If you don't listen to me,
I will break your leg.
Alright, let's forget it,
he is coming.
Remember.
I want the stuff and the man too.
If you mess up, beware of your brain.
Where did you go last night, jerk?
Who are you talking about?
Mind your words.
Damn it!
It needs time
to make good work.
These are your fake passports. Look!
This is British passport.
The Kingdom of Tonga.
Honduras... All are nicely made.
I want 5 more.
No problem, how about the money?
The paper is yours.
Money is mine.
Damn it, how dare you fool me?
Come on, do you want some water?
No, thanks.
Mom, the competition starts,
why daddy hasn't come yet?
Damn it!
I will give you ride.
Don't move, or I will kill you.
The first one
who enters final competition Kung Ku.
The last round,
Tung Chin-hop against Kung Ku.
Shut up!
Run, hurry up!
How are you?
Get lost,
or I will whoever comes close.
Get lost!
Mom, wait for me.
Siu Ku!
Listened?
Get lost!
Step back.
Don't come over!
Siu Ku.
Are you looking for death?
Don't! Brother!
Daddy.
The cops are coming...
Brother, please don't kill me.
That's the achievement of the
little hero. Shut up!
Are you alright, Siu Ku?
Where is daddy?
He should be granted
the Best Citizen Award.
What a little hero!
His achievement.
So great!
Where is daddy?
Good morning, granny...
Good morning.
Good morning, granny...
Kung Ku,
you have to defeat your daddy today.
I am going to school now, goodbye.
Alright,
yesterday's record was broken.
Dad, I have achieved
the same result you made yesterday.
Why do you practice this?
It's so difficult for you.
To control breathing,
it's good to health.
It may reduce the oxygen exhaustion
in blood.
So what?
Mom, in limited oxygen supply,
a human can be survive too.
Even in frozen weather
or under the water,
one will be alive.
It's like hibernation.
So, don't you think
you're a frog or a snake?
I am snake.
A lazy snake.
Come on, have breakfast.
Eat breakfast.
I forgot I have a date,
give me the coat.
Dad,
you promise to go with me
to get the award.
I know where the ceremony is held,
I will be there.
Don't forget.
Be careful!
Daddy, I'll wait for you
in the police station.
Sorry, dad is late.
Will you show me that?
So wonderful.
He is waiting for you
to take a picture.
He said this prize is yours too.
I know why he is angry,
we don't even
have a family picture.
Are you still angry with me?
If you don't like me smoking,
I won't smoke, alright?
You promised.
I'm a man! I'll keep my promise!
Deal.
Do remember your words.
Great! Take this.
It's delicious.
Let's get in.
The door isn't opened,
let's go this way.
Son, I have a present for you.
See.
Mom, a fashionable watch!
Be careful...
Mom, see.
Dad sends me a new watch,
isn't it good looking?
Let me wear it for you.
No, I don't want to scratch it.
I am fine...
Why not go for an injection?
No.
But you are sick.
Let's not see the doctor.
But you have to get treatment.
You know
how expensive is the injection?
I have earned some money
from doing small business.
You'd better get an injection
tomorrow.
Alright, take a seat.
Thank you, uncle.
Mom, come on, take a seat.
Thank you.
You are welcome.
Mom,
are the ants enough for your soup?
Where did you find so much ants?
Fatty and I
discovered a secret place.
The ants there are fat and big, they
are good for curing your sickness.
You'll be responsible for curing mom.
No problem!
I want to show this award to Fatty.
Siu Ku, go...
Run!
You are so nosy, go in.
Fatty must have forgotten
to finish his homework.
It's alright, go back.
Mom, what will we eat tonight?
You just care of eating.
Don't move.
What do you mean?
What are you doing?
Let me go...
Let go of my dad.
Daddy...
My mom said Ku's dad is rascal.
He is a nasty guy!
My mom said
Ku's dad committed crimes!
My mom said your mom is a nosy woman!
Piss off!
I just went hooking.
Heroin isn't mine. It's hers.
Cut the crap.
I want to employ a lawyer.
Where are you taking me to?
Go...
Why are you beating me?
I just hooked,
should I be put in jail?
Cut the crap or I'll kill you.
Almost lost my voice.
What is that guy next door?
Not very special, but his boss
Po Kwong is a notorious person.
I am sending you to Hong Kong
to be an undercover.
You have to observe
and write report.
For the rest, leave it
to Hong Kong government, got me?
Commissioner.
I... I don't want
to be undercover anymore.
My wife and my son
always hear gossip.
Just three months,
you will be back
to the police force then.
We have many thousands
of police stationed in Hong Kong.
We just want Hong Kong be
peaceful and prosperous.
You'll stay in his cell tonight,
and I'll let you two escape.
Shout! Shout loud!
Help!
What's up?
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
Hurry up!
Wait for me,
I don't know where to go.
Run! Hurry...
Dogs!
Hurry up!
Freeze...
Set the dog free.
Don't bite!
Do you mean it?
Freeze...
Run!
Are you alright? Run!
Alright, stop chasing, forget it...
Oh, you have a wife and a kid.
Why are you so impulsive?
I will do that too.
Dad.
Dad.
Son, listen carefully.
I have to leave you and your mom
for a long time.
Your mom is sick,
don't let her worry too much.
When I am away,
you are the only man in the family.
How long will you leave us?
Not long, I will be back soon.
You said you didn't want
to make your wife cry,
If you make your son cry,
he will wake your wife up.
I won't cry.
Son, keep the money.
I will send you money later.
Dad, where are you going?
Don't ask.
You don't allow him to ask
and you don't tell him the answer.
You're giving him hard time.
Why don't you cheat him?
Do you always cheat your son?
Uncle Darkie
will bring your daddy back soon.
I don't have any present for you.
But this one.
This is my safety charm.
Don't spoil the child.
It's cheap stuff,
just to make the kid happy.
Say thank you.
Thank you, uncle.
Good boy...
Uncle will be back soon.
Dad.
Go back.
See you.
If we don't leave now,
I can't stand any more.
I wish I would have a good boy
as him. I won't mind dying.
Hong Kong
Mister, this is yours, thank you.
This is for you.
How much is it?
$1,100.
Wait, I will buy it.
I have money, we are buddy, see?
Are you going to bring me
to see your boss?
Yes, be smart!
What do you like?
WE will come and rob it tomorrow.
Really?
Yes.
Going to work?
You're nuts!
Which one do you like?
Let's rob them tomorrow.
Buddies, I have a million.
I want to buy liquid bombs
from some foreigners.
This is the latest invention.
Even the metal testing machine
of the airport can't check it out.
But I have a problem,
I don't want to pay for the goods,
but I want to get it.
What idea do you have?
Tell me.
Boss, I haven't got anything
in mind yet.
You needn't eat rice from now on.
You'd better eat shit.
Stop pretending,
have you had anything in mind?
Yes, I have a good idea.
When the bank is opened
in the morning,
we will rush in and rob them.
Bull shit!
I don't mean it.
Boss, help.
Pal, don't loose your hands.
Boss... don't step on him.
Got it?
Tell me.
Boss.
When it's time for trade,
we won't show up but rob their goods.
So we'll save our money!
Right. This is what in my mind!
They will have precautions.
You go and collect the goods alone.
Then?
After checking up the good,
pay as usual.
When they are not cautious,
we pretend to be robbers and rush in.
We will take the money
and the arms away.
But they are selling arms.
Will they stand still to wait
for you?
Ask someone to carry bombs
on his back,
so their guns are useless.
No one wants to die.
Alright. You carry the bomb.
You listen to my order,
then come in to rob us.
Wei will come last.
Take care of yourself.
5 years passed!
I'm waiting for your divorce.
And you'll migrate with your wife?
It's not my wish.
I just want to move her away
from Hong Kong.
Ostrich!
My wife said I'm like a turtle.
She's right.
Mr. Po, your friends have arrived,
they are on the 2nd floor.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hello.
Nice to meet you.
The boss is waiting for you.
Can't touch!
Mr. Po please sit down.
How are you?
I'm fine!
You mean it?
Why are you so serious?
I come alone.
They told me you're dangerous,
you are notorious for
double-crossing.
Have you finished?
You'd better brush off!
The amount is right.
The bomb is good?
It's really good.
Really?
Of course.
OK.
I tell you, if you look
for another woman in future,
don't look for thin ones.
They will have bad temper.
You should lower your voice
for talking gossips.
Next time you come to Lithuania,
drinks are on me! OK!
OK...
Let's talk if we go back alive.
Damn you bastard!
Nice guy.
Let's set out.
Let's set out.
Very satisfactory.
Watch out for the kid!
Let's go.
Try to run?
Hurry up.
Drop the guns.
Get down, don't move.
Get the money back.
Move away.
Go out one by one.
Be careful.
Don't move.
Drop the gun
and put down the suitcase!
Drop the guns.
Come on, shoot!
See my bombs!
Hold it.
If you shoot, we will die together.
You can't take any penny.
Drop the guns to the pool.
Listen to him.
Drop the guns into the water.
What are you looking? Hurry up!
Why are you here?
Officer, there is gun war inside.
Gun war?
Run...
Don't move.
Report, there is a gun war
on Junction Road.
Run, run quickly!
The cops are coming.
Be careful!
Come on, get the guns, quick.
Out of bullet.
Escape now.
Run!
Hurry up...
Be careful.
Thank you...
Police! Freeze!
I am Inspector Cheng, don't shoot.
Cop?
Don't move.
Set him free.
Or I will shoot him to death, got it?
Take it to me.
Ask everyone out.
Why are you standing here? Get out.
Hurry up.
Go.
Inspector Fong, what'll we do now?
Stay cool.
Don't mess up.
Stay back.
Stay cool,
you better surrender
Set him free. I will be your hostage.
This is surrounded
by police in here.
Or it'll be difficult for you
to escape.
Move.
Get down.
How to go?
Left.
You are so care about your buddies.
But money isn't with you,
will they think of you?
Shut up.
You'd better surrender.
Cut the crap, go straight!
There is no way ahead.
Get down.
Don't go.
Hold me. Don't loose your hands.
Harder.
This picture is taken by a passenger.
The one in the pictures is related
to this robbery.
After the analysis by the computer,
we've no information about this guy.
We suspect that
he's an illegal immigrant from China.
I want you to go to Peking
to look for some clues.
Have you got anything?
How is it? Tell me.
Why don't you talk?
The guy escaped.
When was it happened?
You better say in Cantonese.
When was it happened?
9th of last month.
From the information,
he has a son and a wife, right?
I think they know nothing about him.
He is newly moved in,
about his background,
I am not that sure.
Can you show me his file?
Sorry, it's not convenient.
Well, thank you.
Here is $245.
I still owe you $5 dollars.
Are you willing to sell this to me
whole heartedly?
I am a man,
I won't take back my words.
Why are you here?
None of your business.
Ku, run!
I have to care, so what?
He stare at you.
Ku run!
Why so noisy?
Do you want a beat up?
Run!
What are you doing?
Look...
See,
Kung Ku's dad is a wanted criminal.
He is like a wanted criminal.
Little bastard! Wanted criminal.
His dad is a wanted criminal.
His son is a bastard.
My dad isn't a criminal.
Bull shit, his dad isn't a criminal.
You bull shit!
Stop! Don't beat him!
What's wrong with you?
Do you have to go to school?
Kung Ku, are you alright?
A call for you.
Siu Ku!
Dad, where are you?
Are there anyone with you?
Yes.
Listen, don't say anything.
I am now in Hong Kong,
how is your mom?
It's difficult for her to get up
from bed.
I sell the watch you sent me
to Fatty.
But I can't have enough money
to take mom to the doctor.
Your mom will recover soon.
Don't tell mom I have called.
Don't tell anyone too.
Can I write to you?
No.
Dad, have you committed any crimes?
Don't ask.
When I am back,
I will give you
a satisfactory answers.
If there is anything wrong with mom,
what'll I do?
Drop down my pager number.
Listen carefully.
117713190
Call me and leave your message.
But I can't return your call at once.
Take good care of mom.
I remember, give me an answer
when you are back.
Don't flush the ants away. No!
Just half mom is left.
What are you looking?
Do you want me to beat you up?
Beat him...
Why do you flush my ants away?
Never say my dad is wanted criminal!
Is that clear?
I've got it.
Run!
Fatty, let's go.
Three points to be paid attention,
time, people and place.
Let's go home!
My mom wants to take me
to buy new clothes, see you later.
See you later.
Don't go... Come back.
Why don't you take the car?
Are you tired?
Mom, I am home.
Siu Ku, you are home!
Mom, how are you today?
I am better.
See, I've caught many ants.
Sorry, are you Mrs. Kung?
I am Fong, I come from Hong Kong
to look for you.
Ku, cook the rice now.
Please take a seat.
Mrs. Ku.
Siu Ku,
I've bought some pork for you.
Thank you.
Who is she?
I don't know.
I'll give you the 5 dollars
I owe you tomorrow.
See you.
Can you understand cantonese?
Did Kung Wei talk to you?
No. Have you seen him?
He is so heartless!
He asked me to bring you money,
why didn't he talk to you?
You and Siu Ku's dad...
We are partners to sell X-rated tape.
What?
What?
I mean X-rated tapes.
Sex videos.
We make big money from it.
Between human beings,
it costs 70 dollars each.
For man and horse, dog or monkey,
it costs one or two hundred.
It'll make good profit!
Is the airport busy?
What people?
Airport.
Airport? Oh, it's very busy!
Mom, the soup is ready.
Thank you.
The secret prescription said
the ants can cure my sickness.
Mom, dad writes to us.
Really?
Let me read for you.
Dear honey, Siu Ku, how are you?
You mush be worrying about me.
Sorry, I am now in Hong Kong
to do business with friends.
I am not settling down,
I will write to you later.
I left in a hurry,
there must be
many gossips around you.
But, don't trust those rumors.
Wait for me, and you will understand.
I send $250 with this letter...
No...
It is $245.
Siu Ku, take good care of mom.
From dad, Kung Wei.
Mom,
here is the money from dad, $245.
I will keep the letter.
Ku, you are so good.
Your dad asked me
to bring you money, I am Fong...
Ku, auntie Fong is my classmate...
No... Sister of my classmate.
She has been living in Hong Kong.
A hawker.
Siu Ku,
I've received your letter today.
You told me you failed in the exam
and you have no face to see me.
This made me feel unrest.
What is meant by unrest?
Upset, that means with worries.
You may find the explanation
from the dictionary.
Isn't it him?
I am not used to sleep early!
When I saw you at the first sight.
I can tell you are not
selling X-rated tapes.
Are you Hong Kong Police?
What crime did he commit?
Isn't it serious?
No, no big deal.
He seldom talks about business
with me.
Someone said
he committed some crimes.
But...
in this family,
he has been a good husband
and a good father.
Whenever he left home.
He worried so much.
It's my fault.
There are so many problems
in this family.
He just carries
all the responsibilities.
How are you?
I am used to it.
I have seen these things
for many times.
He won't leave any clues.
Since you know I am a cop,
why do you let me stay?
I can tell you are
a kind-hearted person.
Take these money back.
Miss Fong, I can't take care of
Siu Ku after Wei left.
I hope you act as his auntie
and play with him.
Alright?
I promise.
Granny, good morning.
You leave so early!
I just take him for a walk.
Siu Ku,
are you going out for playing?
No, I have to wash the clothes
for my mom.
I am leaving, see you.
Good morning!
Good morning.
You look nice after wearing
my mom's cotton wadded jacket.
Really?
Auntie Fong, I think
you are better looking now.
How old are you?
Do you know what's called pretty?
Of course I know!
Is my mom pretty looking?
How about me?
Fatty said you are not pretty at all.
But you are attractive.
Got it? Fatty has taste!
Auntie Fong.
What?
May I ask, are you friend of my dad?
Well... My mom hasn't
any friends in Hong Kong.
You are so smart!
You guess correctly.
Did your father tell you anything?
Yes, he told me something
very important.
He said I am the only man
in this family.
The only man?
You said you are a man?
Right, you are the only little man
of the family.
Your dad told me everything.
I've seen your picture!
Which one?
Family picture of course.
Family picture? Liar.
I am sorry to borrow money from you.
Come on!
Don't forget we are brothers.
We should spend the money together.
When brother gives us money,
I will return it to you.
Let's talk about it later.
Two hamburgers!
OK.
Is boss planning for a big business?
If you don't want to say,
just forget it.
Don't look down upon me!
Boss seems to be dealing
with a Mainlander.
Mainlander? What is he?
A guy named Li.
Po kwong,
I've seen the antiques
you smuggled out for me.
It's OK.
I've contacted all the buyers.
They're very interested in my goods.
Aren't you afraid
of letting the police know?
So the auction must be held
in the open sea.
The buyers should take cash
or cheques from legal firms.
So, there will be large amount
of money on board.
Don't you worry about robbers?
Sure, so I have to rob them first.
That's great!
I love such kind of business!
How much can we earn
from selling antiques?
Let's rob them and kill those buyers.
Later, burn the ship!
So no one will know it.
Sister, you are great!
But be careful, the mainland cops
are paying attention to you.
And they sent undercover
to get close to you.
You have to be careful.
Undercover?
Wei come here.
I will give you a share of my profit.
After doing this business.
Each of you will get half a million.
Where did you get this?
You know antique?
I am expert in getting treasure
from the emperors' coffins.
This horse of Han Dynasty
was found in Shantung.
The body is specially long.
This is rare.
You're something.
I like you so much!
I won't let you down.
Well, we will make money together!
You can get so many antiques
from China,
your partner in Mainland
must be a powerful man!
Man? She is a woman.
Hello, Commissioner.
I am Kung Wei.
Until now,
I just know about the antiques...
are related with a woman named Li.
We need more detailed information.
But I wish to see my wife
and my son.
Your mission hasn't been finished,
you can't go back.
This is an order.
Dad, this is another letter...
But I never knows where it will go.
Since you left,
this is the 5th letter I wrote.
Mom... how are you?
Mr. Kung...
What's the matter?
Mom hasn't been injected
for a long time.
Call the ambulance!
Why don't you tell me?
Siu Ku is too young.
I can't stand him
facing such moment alone.
Please send this letter to his dad.
I know this is your duty.
But I have no choice.
I ask him to co-operate with you...
I just want to beg you...
of not hurting him,
will you promise me?
Siu Ku is going to lose me.
He can't lose his dad.
Miss Fong, I beg you.
Mr. Kung...
Siu Ku!
Mom...
Mom, how are you?
Siu Ku.
Mom is dying.
Mom wants you to write
to your dad each week.
You have to think of him once a day.
Your look will change easily.
Maybe, your dad can't recognize you
few years later.
But I want you
to remember your dad's face.
I won't forget him.
And I won't forget you too.
I will think of you many times
per day.
Ku, bring this letter to Auntie Fong.
Beg her to take this to your dad.
I promise.
Miss Fong, was you born
in the year of Rabbit?
But I have no time.
Otherwise, we will be...
Become good friends.
Auntie Fong,
can you bring me with you?
My plan is...
Turn off the pager.
Alright, let's deal.
Run...
What are you doing?
Remember your identity.
Boss.
Damn it, how dare you beat me?
Damn you!
How dare you beat our boss?
Are you looking for death?
What's wrong with you?
Are you crazy?
I don't think you can stay
any longer here.
Leave this place
after getting what you need.
Don't forget.
You still have a son.
No matter how hard you try,
you have to tolerate.
It will be cold in Hong Kong,
bring more clothes.
What books will you bring
to Hong Kong? Come and fix it.
Don't bring tooth brush,
you can buy one in Hong Kong.
Bring me the underpants,
I will put it in.
What are you looking for?
See whether anything is missing.
Siu Ku.
Are you leaving?
Take this watch.
Don't you like it?
I don't think this watch match me.
This is sent by your dad,
it fits you only.
Come on, let me help you.
I keep this very well,
it isn't scratched.
I wore once.
Thank you.
He is new resident here.
We are not clear about
his background.
Siu Ku.
Siu Ku, you have to come back.
See you. Goodbye!
Dummy.
I am almost scared.
I thought here was Hong Kong!
Mr. Fong, what's the matter?
What did you say? You want
to smuggle him to Hong Kong?
Inspector Fong, isn't he your son?
What did you say?
My dad is Kung Wei,
My mom is Li Ha.
I am Kung Ku.
What did you say?
Boss, a female cop wants
to bring a kid to Hong Kong.
He said his father
is called Kung Wei.
Forget it, kill them first.
I've got it.
Boss, what's the matter?
I don't know what's happened.
Forget it, come on, let's drink.
Ping, cut the crap.
I can arrest you any time.
Auntie, be careful!
Auntie Fong, are you alright?
I am fine.
Go.
Be careful.
The letter.
Don't kill me!
Get lost!
Auntie Fong, are you alright?
It's fine, go!
Auntie Fong, from your outlook,
you are not a simple woman.
You are Hong Kong police, right?
Right, I am a cop.
I do want to arrest your dad.
But now,
I have different point of view.
Why?
After seeing your mom,
I don't believe
your dad is a criminal.
I wanna tell you a secret.
What?
Your dad may be a cop.
Really? I wish to let
the whole world know it.
No way,
your father must have
some reasons to cover his identity.
Can you keep this secret?
Of course I can.
My dad has a pager,
and I didn't tell others.
Do you remember what you promised?
What?
Before getting my consent,
you won't open to public
about this kid.
This relates to three lives.
No kidding! I just do it according
to regulations.
What's wrong?
I just want to seduce Kung Wei out.
Why should I do that?
This is for us.
You want to be promoted and get rich,
that's none of my business.
Don't let me be involved.
Hello, Siu Ku?
Dad, where are you now?
Why are you in Hong Kong?
Auntie Fong brings me here.
Why don't you return call?
I went to buy newspaper.
Lend me your car key.
Where are you going?
Hurry up.
You have no license, take care.
Sure I will drink with you.
Pour more for him. He can drink.
Cheers.
Give it to me,
I'm going to take a shit.
Boss, sorry, I am going to shit.
Following is a news
about an illegal immigrant.
If anyone knows the information
about this boy named Kung Ku.
Or his father Ku Wei,
contact with police at once.
I've been betrayed by Auntie Fong.
Police!
Inspector...
What are you doing?
Inspector Cheng asked me
to guard here.
Siu Ku.
Siu Ku.
I am his son, ask him not to come.
Danger.
How is Auntie Fong treating you?
She is so nice to mom and me.
In order to keep mom's letter.
She don't care about her life.
She guessed you are a cop,
isn't that right?
Did she tell others?
She said this is a secret,
we can't tell others.
Or, it'll be dangerous to you.
But Auntie Fong said,
Hong Kong police wants to arrest you.
She is a cop too.
Don't panic, good cops
just catch bad guys, right?
Who is it?
I recognize you, the one who robbed
and the one who saved me.
You betrayed Siu Ku.
I didn't.
My boss betrayed me.
You just know getting promotion.
How about Mainland cops?
You can't disclose
your identification.
And you made
your family suffers too.
Your wife said
you are a good husband.
Your son said you are good daddy,
so what?
When you wife died,
she wanted me not to hurt you.
Shut up!
Don't you think it worth?
For something,
woman won't understand.
Inspector...
Inspector, what happened?
What's wrong?
He is downstairs,
let's go chasing him!
Send this letter to Ku's dad.
Wei, Miss Fong is our friend
who will help us.
If possible, co-operate with her.
Before die, she promised me...
She won't hurt you.
Although I don't understand
what you did.
I believe
that you have your own reasons.
Just promise me.
Whenever you do anything,
think Ku once, then I will feel easy.
Ku, daddy will come to pick you up
soon.
Come and eat something.
It's fried noodle, it's delicious.
Do you want some?
Thank you, Uncle.
You're welcome...
This is for you.
You are back.
Where have you been? It's late!
Come and have some snack.
Come.
Alright.
Why a kid is here?
His name is Kung too!
Isn't he your son?
Are all Kungs my son?
So, Kung Li must be my sister.
And Chang I-mou must
be my sister-in-law!
So, why should I work?
I will be rich, you know?
Right...
Isn't your dad a cop,
named Kung Wei?
Why should I tell you?
You are so cocky!
You have guts!
Do you want to die?
Let me teach you a lesson.
Kid, why do come to Hong Kong?
I am looking for my dad.
For dad... Where is he now?
He is my heart!
Damn you!
You are going to be killed!
He is so useless.
Your dad is too useless!
If you have guts, just kill me.
My dad won't let you go anyways!
Go to hell!
I will do it!
Don't move...
Aren't you scared of death?
No.
Why do you come to Hong Kong?
I am looking for dad,
to tell him to kill all bad eggs!
No matter what, no mercy!
My mom and I will support him!
You are tougher than me!
He almost made us pick on each other!
He should have been killed.
Boss, he is breathless!
Throw it to the rubbish center.
Yes!
Brother Darkie,
where are we going for fun?
You'll decide it.
I will listen to you tonight.
Alright.
Stay in the car.
Alright.
Enjoy yourself.
I feel a bit cold,
I am going up to get a coat.
I am Fong Yat-wah,
leave your message
after the beep sound.
Miss Fong, I am Kung Wei.
Siu Ku is now in danger,
please go and save him now.
He is in a rubbish collection center
of Wong's Bldg in Kowloon Bay.
Are you cold? Wear my coat.
Thank you, boss.
How is it? Are you drunk?
Follow me.
I am not going, just enjoy yourself.
I want to go out.
You're useless.
Siu Ku, hold on!
My heart aches when I see you here.
You are the only one I like.
I won't give you up
until the last minute.
We are a perfect match.
I can't imagine you are a cop.
Why don't you tell me?
Since you know I am a cop.
So, just go ahead.
I will. You just have
few hundred dollars per month.
If you help me, I'll give you
much more money you want.
If not, you will kill me, right?
If I want to kill you.
I needn't do it myself.
Stop. I haven't finished.
You creep!
Do you want to be shot?
You bastard.
Wei, I don't want to kill you.
We are friends, don't blame me
of not giving you a way out.
Make your choice.
You choose death.
Why are you standing here?
Run him over.
I wanna kill you.
Stop! Damn it! Stop.
Crazy.
Run him over.
Police!
Siu Ku.
Uncle.
Look what I've brought you!
Electric toys.
I have bought some new clothes
for you, like it or not?
I love it!
Siu Ku, do you feel better?
Yes.
Uncle.
What's up?
Do you have any news about my dad?
I called him for days
and he didn't return my call.
I've heard that he was saved
by a female cop.
Don't worry, I will call him for you.
Let's eat first. Come on.
Ku, you are great!
You have strong life!
When you recover teach me some.
Great.
Damn it, I won't be afraid
of being hanged anymore.
What's the meaning of "Damn it"?
Well...
That means great! That means great!
So, isn't it delicious?
Damn it, it's really delicious.
The pager is wet.
You always said I know nothing.
Cause you don't tell me!
No one can bring guns
to the auction held on tomorrow.
The rest act security guards
and take 6 liquid bombs to the ship.
Never let that bitch, Li Nam,
discover that.
Bomb number one to six.
About the location,
I will tell you later.
Let's pretend to be buyers.
Dress formally.
I will give you an hour to dress up.
Let's gather here at four.
These are our invitation cards.
Have you checked Po Kwong?
Inspector Cheng hasn't given
any order, it's difficult for us.
I understand.
In fact, we have asked.
But we can't find the kid.
Go on checking it,
let's keep contact.
Where is Siu Ku?
He is in the police station.
Police station?
For security sake.
Don't worry, no where is safer
than the police station.
Don't worry,
I have arranged everything.
I am going to open the door.
Who is it?
Are you still angry with me?
What? Open the door.
Why are you here?
I come to drink a cup of coffee.
Coffee?
Uncle.
Siu Ku, are you better?
Much better!
Uncle, where is my dad?
I tried hard to call him
in these days.
Uncle, you are so smart.
This is the smartest look in my life.
Damn it! What a big mouth!
Uncle will be smarter and smarter!
I have something urgent to do today.
I am now taking you to a safer place.
Pack up now.
Damn it, Siu Ku, someone is coming.
What'll I do?
Go into the water.
Don't come up without my order.
Be careful.
Boss.
Where do you hide the kid?
I don't!
Isn't this your son's shoe?
Are you fooling me?
Boss...
You bastard!
I set the kid free, so what?
I have been dog for my life, now,
I want to be a man!
Kill me.
Be a man in your next life.
Boss.
This way.
Prepare for setting out.
Uncle... Wake up, uncle!
You haven't learnt my stance, uncle.
I am stupid,
I can't learn you Kung-fu.
Siu Ku, sorry.
I brought your dad out.
Will you blame me
of not taking him back?
I won't.
Take this card to your dad.
Ask him to go there.
He sacrifices so much
for this case only.
Use this phone to call him.
I know.
Uncle, wear your charm,
you will be alright.
Wear it...
Uncle.
Uncle...
Who is looking for Mr. Kung?
Are you leaving message
of phone number?
I am his son.
Please ask him
to call Uncle Darkie's mobile phone.
Have you finished drinking?
I've almost finished.
Your pager is ringing.
Let me take it for you.
Do you have anything to talk to me?
Go ahead.
Sorry,
this ring has been late for 5 years.
I know you're the woman I need most.
You mean yes?
No?
Why?
For you are not the man I need now.
I am so thin and I am bad tempered.
In fact, I don't fit you.
Where did he go?
Dad.
Uncle Darkie said Po Kwong wants
to commit crime on board.
He left you an invitation card.
And he put it the telephone kiosk
of Pak Shek Pier.
I am now in the ship of Po Kwong.
I will be right there, be careful.
We will reach there soon,
when will you make it?
Itll be done soon.
Mister, it needs time!
It's the fault of that bitch!
She should have given us the line!
What?
Should we tell others,
"Please let me steal a line".
"For we want to bomb you to death!"
Right?
No! Boss.
Idiot!
Boss, we can see them.
Listen, fix 6 bombs
at the locations I marked.
Two on board, and 4 in the cabins.
Not anyone less.
Got you.
Watch the TV.
When you receive our message,
come and assist us.
Boss, here we are.
Daddy.
Call daddy.
I've watched you on board.
Step back and squat,
watch what's that.
Dad, there is something
in front of you.
It's safe on board,
and there are four down below.
The Hong Kong people
are so efficient!
Come here, please.
Thank you.
Sister, long time no see!
Don't worry, it's of no problem.
This is wonderful!
Mr. Fong take a look please.
You guy must work hard
to getting the whole thing out.
Ask him not to panic,
it's not seen.
I am doing for his own good,
ask him not to blame me.
The fourth one is below
his right foot.
The auction will be held 5 minutes
later.
The calling price will be raised
$50,000 each.
The first item is a statue found in
East Han Dynasty.
Battery is low.
The price is US$230,000.
$500,000...
$550,000.
Is only one left,
why he still didn't call me.
Dad, my phone is out of battery.
The last bomb is right here.
Any more then 3 million.?
Any higher offer.
I offer a billion!
I will buy everything here.
Who do you think you are?
I have put bombs here.
Li Nam, what's the matter?
Answer him, you are my partner.
What did you say?
See what I have put
inside your pocket!
This is for you.
Is the demonstration clear?
You'd better co-operate with me.
Give me all your money!
Run...
Stop running!
It's you again!
You'd better go back
to be a mainland cop.
It's better
to bring you back together.
Except the bomb placed in Li's,
I've cleared everything.
Damn it! Don't you think
I would believe in you?
Do you want me to die with you?
Don't you believe it?
See...
1...
2, 3, 4...
Damn it! Do you want to be hero?
Not that easy!
Take the money back!
Not anyone should run away!
Yes.
Good work!
I will have bigger share now.
Run now!
Block them for me.
Alright...
You just earn few hundred dollars
per month,
Why are you so tough?
Don't you think
you can fight with me?
It's mine...
Boss.
That's my money!
Damn!
Boss.
Bad egg!
Son, you shouldn't have come.
What am I afraid of? I died once.
Don't you scare of death?
No!
Don't you scare of death?
Stop.
Siu Ku.
Again.
I love betraying my buddies.
I will get a bigger share!
Dad.
Finished?
Shoot if you have guts!
I will kill him.
Drop the gun! Hurry up.
Drop the gun!
Don't move.
Shoot! Go ahead.
Dare you shoot?
Sho...
Shoot!
Shoot!
Shoot... Dad.
Siu Ku.
Siu Ku.
Siu Ku...
He has no breath! What'll we do?
Send him to hospital at once!
To the helicopter.
Hurry up!
Take Siu Ku away.
Do you want to go?
Forget about me.
I want you to die with me.
Kung Wei!
Run!
Run now!
What did your father tell you?
Yes, he told me one thing.
He said I am the only man
in the family.
Where is my son?
How is my son?
Siu Ku.
Siu Ku.
Son, wake up, dad is here.
Mr. Kung, sorry we've tried our best.
My son knows breathless Kung-fu.
He had been long lacking of oxygen,
he died.
Son...
Siu Ku won't die.
Siu Ku can't die.
He won't die.
Would you please stay calm.
Son.
Siu Ku.
Siu Ku, you...
Auntie Fong, you are so pretty.
It's a miracle! He is alive.
What are you looking?
This is our family business!
