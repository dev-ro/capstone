All right, settle down.
Now that you've seen the heart, let's go.
To the planetarium.
It is awesome to think of
the hundreds of billions of stars
spread in an infinite volume of space,
too vast for the human mind to comprehend.
In ancient times, man thought of the stars...
Hi.
.. as the mythological gods themselves,
but now we know they're bright centres
of their own universes.
Our lives seem like small grains of sand...
- Scary, isn't it?
- .. compared to the immortality of the stars.
It's like trying to think about dying.
Regardless of their distance and mystery...
- What would you do if I died?
- .. the heavenly stars,
- the shrinking planetary systems...
- I'd die.
- .. the red giants and the white dwarves...
- I'd die too.
.. continue to fascinate man,
dazzling him as beautifully designed jewels,
against the evening skies.
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
That's all, but on the way back to the bus,
everyone stop and look at the moon rock.
It's fascinating.
It's over four billion years old.
Hey, you. What are you doing here?
You don't belong in this group.
- What's your name?
- Er, David.
David Axelrod, sir. I'm...
I'm a senior, sir.
I'm taking independent study.
Go on, get outta here, get outta here.
Come on, let's go.
Everybody, this way. Let's go.
Roy, I don't want you to worry about this.
We've got a lot of options open to us.
- We can always appeal.
- There's nothing we can do about it.
There's a hell of a lot we can do.
They only took it to the state court.
- We're going to do a...
- We gotta push it to the Supreme.
- I don't know where we'll find the money.
- Got to get a cert.
- One out of 20...
- Mom, I'm going.
- Rose, I've been through them all.
- Mom.
- Do you think we have the chance there?
- Mother. I'm going.
- Good night, everybody.
- Is it Halloween?
- I thought Halloween was October.
- It's a special occasion.
My God, is that my old tuxedo?
Was I ever really that skinny?
If you're not eating at home,
tell your mother.
- I'm going to Jade's.
- Who's Jade?
A Chinese person?
Yeah. She just arrived from
the People's Republic of China.
She's studying capital investment.
- What else?
- How do you like that?
We call ourselves socialists
and our son dresses like a Rockefeller.
Leave him alone. He's in love.
You're beautiful.
- We should go in. Everybody's waiting.
- David!
Where did you get the threads?
You look fantastic.
It's my father's old tux.
- Hi, Sammy.
- Hey, David's here. Can we eat now?
Hey! Hi, Hugh.
Seen the insects we're having for dinner?
Shut up, smartass, I'm trying to educate
this boy's palate.
- Smells delicious.
- Delicious? Damned with faint praise!
- The knife goes on the left.
- The fork goes on the left.
- The knife goes on the left.
- It goes on the right.
Take the fork, put it on the right.
The knife goes on the left.
David! Is he here?
- David.
- Good evening, Ann.
I don't want you to look.
What's going on? What?
- Close your eyes.
- What?
- Mom, where did you get that?
- Where are you?
- No, keep your eyes closed
- Come on.
- Wait till you see this.
- Ta-da!
Oh wow. That's incredible, Ann.
That's beautiful.
Have you ever seen anything like it?
I found it today in this thrift shop.
Look at it. Look at the fabric.
- It's falling apart.
- It's pure silk. Oh, don't pick at it!
It's 2,000 years old.
- It looks that way.
- It'll just go up!
- David, David, you look smashing in that.
- Thank you.
Eat, drink and be merry.
- Wow, those crabs look great, Dad.
- Speciality of the house.
- Wine. Who's gonna get the wine?
- I'll get it. Where is it?
- In the pantry.
- I'll show him.
- Right there. Get the red one.
- This?
- Yeah.
- I love red wine. How about this?
OK. Good. Two's enough.
- Does the fork go on the right or the left?
- Are you right-handed or left-handed?
- Right-handed.
- Put it on either side.
Let's go.
I love you.
- Where's that wine?
- Let's go.
Sammy,
bring the corkscrew while you're there.
Laugh, my lads. Have on with drinking.
'Tis drinking makes the world go round.
Bravo, bravo. I've got one.
I remembered it the other day.
Um, wine comes in at the eye.
- No, no! You got it all wrong.
- And love comes in at the mouth.
- Wine comes in at the mouth...
- Bravo.
.. and love comes in at the eye.
Very sweet.
And that's all we know for truth,
before we grow old and die.
I lift my glass to my mouth,
I look at you, you...
And I sigh.
Ahhh.
Thank you.
Who is that riffraff out there?
Is that Susan?
- Who's Susan?
- Wait till you hear her new song.
- Do you like the way she sings?
- Yeah. She's really sexy.
Hey, David...
Keith, where's the bathroom?
What is this, a gymnasium?
- You look ravishing tonight.
- Thank you.
- Did anyone tell you that?
- Wait, hold on.
- You have a piece of chocolate right... there.
- I do?
Right. Good.
Here they come.
The troubled masses.
Come in, come in.
Welcome to my humble abode.
- Can you take these?
- What do you expect me to do with those?
That's my father, not the butler.
Go in there. It's all set up.
Mommy... Come here a second.
Mommy, I want you to meet Susan.
This is my mother.
This is Susan.
Hello, Susan.
- I'm happy to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
No, no. Not now.
They're gonna be here all night.
- We'll wait.
- No.
David, I've been looking for you.
I thought you were gonna help us set up.
- He's busy right now.
- Yeah, I see.
Pappy doesn't like
people being in here.
David is not people. He's part of the family.
Hm.
Well, Pappy wants his trumpet. Bring it
down when you're finished playing doctor.
- He thinks he runs the place.
- Did you really mean that?
- That he runs the place?
- No.
What you said about
me being part of the family.
- You like that, don't you?
- I like that.
But watch out.
We are a very special family.
We are very particular about who joins.
Come on. Let's go.
Thank you.
Susan, are you going to sing?
You have to sing.
Come on, quiet down.
Sit down. Quiet down.
Sshhh, sshhh.
My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right
My first love
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make
And I
I want to share all my love
With you
No one else will do
Cos your eyes
Tell me how much you care
Oh, yes
You'll always be
My endless love
Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
Forever
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms
And love
I'll be a fool for you
I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Cos you
You mean the world to me
You know I've found in you
My endless love
Where's my book?
Jade, what are you doing?
- We're cleaning up.
- Oh.
Don't. Wait till tomorrow.
Annie, aren't you coming up to bed?
God damn it.
- Who built that fire?
- We did.
- Why?
- We were freezing, Pappy.
I am in charge of the fireplace here.
Nobody builds fires in my fireplace
except me.
It's the one thing in this goddamn house
that still belongs to the master.
I am retiring. Come on, you.
- Time for this boy to be going home.
- I'll go home when it's burned down.
I'll go home when it's burned down, sir!
- Aye, aye, sir.
- All right, then.
All right, then. Go when it's burned down.
Ahh, God.
These steps seem like Mount Everest.
- You were great with the trumpet, Pappy.
- Ohh, thank you, honey.
I'm a little out of practice, I'm afraid.
Ahh, I'm tired.
- It was a good party, though.
- Yeah, it was.
Your father's right, though.
It's late, I'd better go.
I've got a big day ahead of me tomorrow.
- I have biology in the morning.
- I have a French test.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- OK. Good night.
La, la, la-la-la-la
Oh, boy!
I'm too old for that kind of madness.
I'm barely breathing.
What is that book?
- He got it for me.
- Who got it for you?
David. We were talking about
Russian writers, Gogol,
and the next day he brought it over for me.
- I thought it was very nice of him.
- I just bet you did.
I'll bet you gave his cheek a nice little peck.
Didn't you?
I don't miss a trick, my friend.
Good night!
Hi, Dad.
Oh, hi!
You coming or going?
Going. Keith said
we all have to get up at five tomorrow.
We're going to go duck hunting.
So I've been told.
You know...
I read those stories.
The ones you published in the Atlantic.
- I'd like to talk to you about them sometime.
- Sometime.
You don't have to court us all.
You sort of invited yourself along
tomorrow morning, didn't you?
Keith was talking about it
and it sounded really interesting.
I'm sure Hugh was very flattered.
But don't try too hard with Keith.
I know, he was the one
who brought you home in the first place,
you were his find.
You turned out to be more than that.
Well, I'd better be going.
Good night.
Good shot. God, he's amazing.
Where did he learn to shoot like that?
In the army?
No, he was in the air force, right?
His father taught him.
My grandfather was taught how to shoot
by his father.
Family tradition.
My grandfather built that place.
Pappy let it go.
- I'm going to rebuild it one of these days.
- Yeah?
That's a great idea.
You're good at doing stuff like that.
I'll help you, OK?
We'll come up here on weekends.
And Jade would love it.
Imagine getting up in the morning
with the lake right there.
Of course,
this is a place for the whole family.
Just because you're fucking my sister
doesn't make you family.
I don't know about you but after that movie
I'm going to have a drink.
I'll join you in a moment.
Hi, Pappy. How was the movie?
Very good.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Oh, my God. He saw me.
He's seen a naked man before.
Oh, come on. They're always claiming
they're so open-minded.
I mean, this is my room.
- He can't say anything.
- Wanna bet?
- Are you gonna jump out of the window?
- If he comes in here, he'll kill me.
Then we'll die together.
Come on.
- What's that look?
- David is here.
I just caught them bare-assed
up in her room.
My God. I thought it was something awful.
You were meant to catch them, I'm sure.
She didn't even bat an eyelash.
Well...
You didn't raise her to be a hypocrite.
I mean, you know
he's been staying over, don't you?
Yes. He hides in the house
till they think we're asleep,
and, of course, he scuttles away at dawn.
They're rather sweet. Like bats.
I don't know what to do about this.
I'm so happy to hear you say that.
You're always so definite with the children.
Let's all be open about sex.
Well...
they certainly got the idea.
They feel free to express love.
It's worth all those awful frank discussions
at the dining room table.
I'm not talking about morality.
- This boy thinks he can come in here...
- They believed everything that we said.
A girl like that doesn't have to take
the first guy who comes along.
I didn't realise we were saving her
for somebody special.
- Oh...
- Are we saving her for someone rich?
God damn it. That's not fair.
The girl is 15 years old.
When is she gonna study,
when is she gonna sleep?
Come on. You're the one who's always
saying she's sleeping too much.
I know it's difficult, but aren't you happy
that she has someone?
That someone finally had the courage
to wake up Sleeping Beauty?
It had to happen, sooner or later.
Please take your book,
The Essentials Of American History,
and turn to page 47, "Mobilising For War,"
Come on. Page 47. Hurry up.
Congressmen faced overwhelming tasks
in raising and organising armies...
Come in.
You're home early tonight.
How's Jade?
Fine. She's got a French test tomorrow
and I've got all this.
We decided we've got to study.
You always get good grades.
A few years from now, who's going to
remember what grades you got in calculus?
That's not what you're gonna remember
about this time of your life, is it?
- Huh?
- Nah.
- You happy?
- Yeah
Good for you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Hello?
I've just finished the translation
up to where she traps the bus.
- She what?
- She traps the bus.
She traps a bus?
It doesn't mean that.
It means she catches a bus.
"Atrappe" means she catches a bus.
Come on, concentrate.
Hey! I love you.
I love you too.
The French are very energetic
and they'd rather trap a bus.
Hey, mademoiselle.
You've been on over an hour.
Will you give me a break, please?
- If he's not here, he's on the phone.
- I have to study. Bonne nuit.
Bitch.
I'm going to name a star after you.
I'll put it...
Where?
Do you think I'm too small on top?
You're perfect.
My eyes are too close together.
They're perfect.
When I'm wrinkled and fat,
you'll stop loving me. C'est la vie.
I'll never stop loving you.
You can't say that. You don't know.
Yes, I do.
I knew that from the very first.
I'll never stop loving you. I never want to.
You're all I care about.
And me. The person I am when I'm with you.
It's kinda scary.
It keeps on getting stronger and stronger.
I used to think it would be like being thirsty.
Sometimes you'd feel like you'd had enough.
It's not like that.
You'd better go.
I've got to sleep.
I don't want to stop.
Ever.
Being with you.
I don't want to go.
- Hugh?
- Yeah.
What time is it?
I don't know. Go back to sleep.
- What's the matter?
- Wait a minute.
- What are you doing? Give me that!
- No! No!
Give me it. Open your hand, damn it!
- Jesus Christ, I don't believe this.
- I can't sleep.
- You don't fool around with these things!
- I can't sleep.
Neither can anybody else in this house!
Hugh, for heaven's sake.
She comes in here,
helps herself to these pills.
- I needed something to sleep.
- You don't help yourself to pills like this.
Why don't you lock the cabinet?
It's too early for all this.
Let her have a pill.
Stay the hell out of this. I'm the doctor here
and I don't want her to have these.
Then give me something else.
You bring your boyfriend over, you keep
everybody else awake. I'm fed up with it.
- I can't sleep with all this racket going on.
- I will not have this family torn apart.
David cannot stay here!
Yes, he can! It is my room.
We are not a couple of little kids.
He doesn't give a damn about you.
All he cares about is his own satisfaction.
I don't want him in your room,
I don't want him in this house!
- Stop it.
- You're just jealous of us!
- Baby, calm down.
- You're such a hypocrite.
You say one thing to David
and something else to me.
You change your mind
from one minute to the next.
- Look at the way he sucked up to everyone.
- Stay out of this.
- I brought him here. I want to apologise.
- Back to your room.
- Do you hear me?
- If you want to play father, play father.
If you say I can't see him, I won't,
just make up your mind.
- Talk to your daughter.
- You're a hell of a doctor. She's hysterical.
- You encouraged this mess, not me.
- You handle it. I don't know what you want.
- We love each other.
- Damn it, I don't want him in this house.
- She'll just see him in school.
- I'll drag her out,
- I'll send you to live with your uncle!
- Leave us alone.
Damn! Ever since that kid came in
this house, I've got nothing but back-talk...
Morning, Hugh.
Hi, Keith.
Keith?
David.
I don't want you to go in the house.
Why? What's the matter?
You and Jade
won't be seeing each other for a while.
- What?
- You heard what I said.
This thing's gotten totally out of control.
I made a mistake
giving you so much freedom around here.
Now Jade's fallen behind in her schoolwork,
she can't sleep at night.
Jade didn't say anything to me about this.
Well, I'm telling you. I want you to stay away
until after school is out. 30 days.
You can't do this.
Don't you tell me what I can do and can't do.
Jade is my daughter.
She's only 15 years old.
After 30 days,
we'll take another look at the situation.
Do you understand?
- Is she in there?
- Don't you go in that house.
- I'm going to talk to Jade.
- You get the hell outta here.
No.
I want you out!
What the hell's going on?
Hugh!
- I want to talk to Jade.
- You'd better go talk to Mrs Baxter.
Return her call. She's called three times.
I'll talk to David.
- David...
- I've gotta talk to Jade.
Hey...
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.
Hugh has to do this.
He's trying to break us up.
That's what he's trying to do.
He's trying to give us all a chance
to catch our breath.
You and Jade have pushed this too far.
We're not a couple of little kids,
you come out and say,
"You can't play together".
We love each other. It's not fair.
- Did he say a month?
- 30 days.
Fine. 30 days. It's not such a long time.
You have finals, you have graduation.
Jade has her exams.
Oh, my God. I am sounding like a mother.
Don't inflict that on me, please.
Just promise me.
Give me your word.
Don't make Hugh do something
he'll regret. We'll all regret.
This isn't going to change anything.
You're part of our lives.
Jade. Jade!
- Are you gonna be at my party tonight?
- Will Jade be there?
Of course she's going to be there.
Come on.
- I heard she was with someone.
- She broke up with him.
Hey, I'm available. What time?
You know our house.
Whenever you want. Catch you later.
See you then.
I have an idea. What do you say
we kidnap her? Say, a million in ransom.
Shut up.
If some woman did that to me,
I'd burn her damn house down.
Hey, I tried that. Did I ever tell you guys?
Eight years old and I was into arson.
- You're full of it.
- No, I'm serious.
I lit a whole pile of newspapers.
Ever try to light a whole pile
of wet newspapers?
Jesus, it smokes like crazy.
I got real scared, see.
Do you want to hear the wild part? It's like
I'm a hero. They thought I saved the block.
To this day, my mother thinks I'm a hero.
You better not tell her
what I just told you.
- I'll see you later.
- Hey, where are you going? David?
I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can't get enough of you, baby...
David. David!
David, they're going to call the cops.
Feel the magic...
It might wake him up
to have to talk to the police.
Too much self-dramatising around here.
- I hope he gets her out of his system.
- It's none of our business.
It is our business. You should have heard
what Margaret said about that household.
Oh, Margaret...
I wish she'd told me sooner because
I would've said something about it.
He's not a baby.
He can take care of himself.
He can't take care of himself.
He's in love with that girl.
The house is the joke
of the neighbourhood. Into drugs, everything.
- A relic of the '60s.
- Who are you to talk about them that way?
You've never even met them.
- Thank God I haven't, because If I had...
- You wouldn't understand them.
Good or bad, at least they're a family.
They talk to each other.
They listen to one another.
- Knock it off.
- They do things together.
They're wonderful people. The only people
you listen to are your goddamn clients.
Then why don't you live with them?
Obviously, anyone is better than your family.
Once had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out, had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Once had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
Seemed like the real thing,
but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
In between
What I find is pleasing
And I'm feelin' fine
Love is so confusing,
There's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you
It's just no good
You teasin' like you do
Once had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out, had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Lost inside adorable illusion
And I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using
Please don't push me aside
We could have made it cruisin', yeah
Yeah, ridin' high
On love's true bluish light
Oooh, whoa-oh
Oooh, whoa-oh
Oooh, whoa-oh
Oooh, whoa-oh
In between
What I find is pleasing
And I'm feelin' fine
Love is so confusing
There's no peace of mind
- If I fear I'm losing you
- Hey, Keith! T elephone.
Don't answer that. It's the neighbours.
Assholes. Shut the goddamn door, please.
Shit.
Such a cool party.
I've got these tickets for Florida...
.. she's beautiful.
- So listen...
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Good night.
Jade.
Jade.
Jade... Jade.
Jade! Jade, the door!
Jade! Jade! Jade!
- What?
- Quick. The house is on fire.
We can't go out this way. We'll have to go
out the back. Quick. Everybody out.
Quick! Get out the back.
Where's Keith?
Quick. Everybody out.
God!
Keith!
Keith!
Keith!
Everybody out!
Stay here. Leave everything.
Just get out of the house.
Everybody, get out!
What the fuck are you doing here,
you little bastard?
- Come on, get out of the house!
- I'll tear your goddamn head off!
Stay back, stay back.
Come on, come on. Get out.
David? Go on, get out of there!
David, come on.
Where's the stairway?
Is there anybody else?
Come on, come on.
Arson is one of the most grievous offences
to come before a court.
Your client is guilty of arson
by his own admission.
He has been convicted of arson
in the second degree
and it is within my power to sentence him
to prison for as long as 20 years.
In determining sentence, however,
I must take into account the psychiatric
evaluations of the probation reports
and the testimony of the boy's family.
And I see grounds
for some leniency in this case.
I am sentencing him to five years' probation.
That's ridiculous.
On the understanding that he enter
a psychiatric facility approved by the court.
The most ridiculous thing I've heard
in my life. It's supposed to be justice.
But let me emphasise that unless David
wants to spend most of that time in prison,
he will remain under treatment
until his doctors can convince this court
that he no longer presents
a danger to himself or to others.
Part of the condition will be that he may not
attempt to contact any member of this family
in any way in the future.
What is it, Leonard? Wanna talk about it?
What's the matter?
- He's crying.
- Can't you sleep?
- I was asleep.
- I'll give you a pill.
- No.
- Then get back to bed.
Come on.
I'll give you something.
Calm down. This'll make you feel better.
Open your mouth. Down the hatch.
All right. Good boy.
Looks like you've got presents.
Let's take a look.
- That's a fat one today.
- It's going to need two stamps.
- I'll attend to it later.
- I never find the time to write letters.
Well, you should.
It's really important, you know.
Otherwise, a person could go crazy
in a place like this.
- The doctors say you're making progress.
- I want to get out of here.
Don't you think your father and I
are aware of that?
They don't want to keep people here.
They told me that
and showed me the figures.
I want to get out of here,
I want to come back home.
Listen, am I paranoid?
I got this idea
that you two aren't getting along so well.
- Arthur and I?
- I said that to one of my doctors.
Of course, you have to talk about family
and things like that.
They've gotta talk about something.
It's pretty common. Families fall apart
when the kid goes in the nuthouse.
- They blame each other.
- It's nothing like that.
It's nothing to do with you.
How long have we been married? 25 years?
So we've had our ups and downs.
You've just never noticed it before.
So what?
Don't worry. You think about yourself.
Quiet.
You. Come on, you're in this group today.
Come on, let's go.
John. Damien.
You have a ten o'clock appointment
to see Dr Miller.
Will you tell him I'm studying?
All right, but this is the fourth week in a row
you've skipped therapy.
David.
David.
What would you do if I died?
I'd die.
I'd die too.
I don't ever want to stop being with you.
This is getting completely out of control.
You and Jade
are not going to see each other again.
He's trying to break us up.
That's what he's trying to do.
You get the hell out of my house.
Jade, Jade!
No!
Stay with me! Jade, no!
Are there enough stamps?
Yes, this is enough postage.
- Is there any mail for me?
- Mm-mm. No.
OK. Thank you.
- Any mail for me?
- Mm-mm. No.
John. Take this to Dr Miller, please.
OK, Bob. Today, we're going to do
a little mirror therapy.
I want you to come over to the mirror.
Just relax and take it easy.
We're gonna work this out, OK?
- Whom do you see in the mirror?
- Me.
That's very good.
Now, tell me. Who is me?
Think carefully.
Look in the mirror and tell me. Who is me?
What is your name?
- Bob.
- Very good, Bob, very good.
Now, I want you to just touch your chin.
Good. Now, whom are you touching?
- I'm touching me.
- Very good, very good.
Now let's go over here. I want you
to remember what you saw in the mirror.
Because what you saw was real.
That was you in the mirror.
That's right.
Jade!
They're trying to make me think I'm insane.
I've got to get out of here.
- Listen. The doctor said...
- Don't listen to him. Listen to me.
- Let me tell you what he said.
- Listen to me!
- You don't understand.
- You don't understand. You don't listen.
You listen to them. You listen to lawyers.
For once, God damn it, listen to me.
Listen to your son.
They're killing me.
I'm dying.
Get the fuck out of here, Leonard.
Go on, leave us alone.
Look at him.
Do you want to take him home?
Well, that's what you're gonna take home.
You've got to get me out of here.
Look. I'm holding on day by day.
You don't know what one day is like here
and I've been here almost two years.
You've got to get me out of here.
We've got to do something about him.
We must.
Hello? Oh, yes!
Margaret, we just arrived.
That's why I'm so out of breath.
Yes, he's just fine.
He's gonna be OK.
Well, you know. It's going to be an
adjustment and I want him to be happy here.
Arthur was magnificent.
Completely convinced the doctors. Hm?
Oh, no, we don't have to worry about them,
thank goodness, but he is only on probation.
Well, he can't travel.
He can't even get a driver's licence.
We are not going to argue the conditions.
He can't leave Chicago and that's that.
Don't worry.
I want you to take it easy this weekend.
On Monday morning,
you're gonna be starting a whole new life.
By the end of the week, you'll have
a whole new set of friends.
You'll see. It's all gonna help.
What?
It'll help you forget.
I don't mean forget...
I know there are some things
you'll want to remember.
I only saw her once.
You were together on your bicycle
and she... waved at me.
I'll remember that picture
for the rest of my life.
But it's over, David.
They've moved back east,
New York someplace.
Anyway...
That's the past.
Nobody can ever take that away from you.
But you can never bring it back.
I love her.
David...
You're in love with a girl
who no longer exists.
- How do you know?
- In all this time, she never called or wrote.
Of course not.
Those bastards stopped my mail.
How would she know what to think?
She may think I hate her.
David, for God's sake, let her go.
No. I can't.
No one ever thinks
they can forget their first love.
But we can.
I know because it happened to me.
David, your mother and I...
Separation.
About six weeks now.
We've been considering it for some time
but we didn't want you in hospital thinking
you didn't have a home to come back to.
Her name is Barbara Sherwood.
You've never met her.
I love her, David.
I'll tell you something.
Seeing you in love
reminded me of what it's like.
How it feels.
Made me remember.
I never thought I could believe in all this
a second time, but...
I do.
It can happen for you too.
That boy has never been punished.
I knew when they sent him to this
country club they didn't understand him.
Why wasn't I told about his release?
I mean before, not afterwards.
I was told my family would be protected.
Whose decision was this?
Was this your decision?
- He was punished by his stay here.
- Bullshit.
- He's matured sufficiently...
- That's a lot of crap!
He burned down my house.
He tried to burn me and my family to death.
Would you calm down? What'll satisfy you?
Putting him in jail the rest of his life?
Come on.
I wanna tell you something. If that kid comes
near me or anybody in my family ever again,
I'll kill him.
You know, I don't like surprises
and you won't stop surprising me.
I've been having so many visitors.
Sammy's been camping out on the sofa.
He went back to school this morning.
This is nice, this place.
The nouveau moi.
- Where should I sit?
- Assuming you should?
Tell me if you want me to go.
Still doing it?
Still giving people permission
to say what's on their mind?
What brings you to New York?
You.
I wanted to see you again.
It's been a long time.
Two years.
Hugh predicted
that you'd find me and get in touch.
And I should have been the hardest.
Damn him. He is clairvoyant sometimes.
Once we didn't have
those old doors to slam,
the quarrels just went on and on.
- You didn't finish this.
- I'm paying for this one. It was fine.
- What were we talking about?
- Um...
- Your divorce.
- My divorce.
My happy divorce.
Now Hugh is living in New Jersey
with his girl of the moment.
And they frequently
come by the apartment.
Hugh thinks we should all be great friends.
She sits in a corner and glares at me.
She hates me, of course.
Thinks I've put him through hell.
Do you think I should go to the wedding?
When are they getting married?
Who knows?
She has the matrimonial glint in her eye.
It'll be a great relief for everybody.
My children will have a devoted stepmother.
She fawns on them.
Keith and Ingrid are great chums.
- What's her name?
- Ingrid Ochester. Citizen of Jupiter.
She drives a van, believes in an astrological
explanation for everything.
She lives in the stars.
Do you still want to be an astronomer?
I'm sure she's right.
There is such a thing as fate.
I'm glad to hear that you're writing again.
It's great.
Tell me. That story you wrote about me.
Do you have a copy of it?
I'd like to read it sometime.
It isn't just about you.
It's about you and Jade and me.
It's about a time
I saw the two of you making love.
You saw us?
I heard something.
I thought there were robbers in the house.
I was halfway down the stairs
and I saw you, the two of you,
in the fire light.
I was dazzled. I couldn't move.
You never knew I was there, did you?
No.
And it changed everything, that night,
everything that I believed about love.
About my marriage.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm talking about.
It feels good.
Come and sit next to me.
I don't want to sit here all alone.
I think that night, that night that I came down
and saw you with Jade,
and then made love to my husband...
I was making love to you.
You know,
they thought we were lovers, you and I.
Did they?
Maybe we should have done them the favour
of making them right.
It's so nice to be here.
I missed you. It was a long time.
The only thing that I regret...
and the only things I'll ever regret
are things I didn't do.
In the end, that's what we mourn.
The paths we didn't take.
People we didn't touch.
I should be angry.
I know it's difficult to understand but...
I can't make love to anybody but Jade.
It's just the way I feel.
I'd better go.
- Where are you staying?
- I don't know.
It's late and you don't know your way around.
Well, I saw a place near the bus terminal
called The Ivanhoe.
Oh, my. You don't know your way around,
do you?
That area's too rough at night.
You'd better stay here.
Sleep on the sofa.
My kids do all the time.
Let yourself out in the morning
and get breakfast elsewhere.
Call me tomorrow, David.
For heaven's sake, don't drop by.
Hugh and Ingrid turn up on Saturdays.
David? Did you hear what I said?
What time's the next bus to
Burlington, Vermont? Burlington, Vermont.
2:30? Thank you, thank you.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Watch where you're going!
Oh, my God!
- Look what...
- I think he's dead.
Look what happened to him!
Help me, please.
No!
Anybody else for Burlington?
Hugh was hit by a car.
This afternoon.
And he's dead.
Killed. Dead on arrival.
He never knew what happened.
Is that Sammy?
Who's that?
- Ingrid, this is David. Our friend.
- Hello, David.
This is Ingrid Ochester, Hugh's friend.
- What the hell is he doing here?
- David was in town. He came to see me.
I don't understand this.
Did she tell you? My father's dead.
I want to talk to you, Keith.
- We used to be good friends.
- This has nothing to do with you,
so don't push in now.
- You don't give a damn about my father.
- That's not true.
I loved your father. He saved my life.
You came here looking for my sister.
Well, my sister doesn't want to see you.
My sister hates you.
You can stop looking for her.
Don't you understand? Jade hates you.
Hush, Keith.
David. Can't you stay?
You don't have to go back.
- Find a hotel.
- It doesn't matter any more.
Don't listen to Keith. Go to that hotel.
The Ivanhoe. I'll tell Jade.
Thing that's so weird
is I didn't even see it happen.
For God's sake. That is the way Hugh was.
He was so damned arrogant.
He even had to have his way at a stop light.
It's so stupid. I'm sorry, but I should know.
It isn't fair.
Ann, I just want to understand
what happened.
You've been saying that all afternoon.
I'm sorry,
but she makes me so angry I could spit.
- Will you give these to Jade?
- She tries to be difficult.
She may not want to see me any more.
- What do you mean?
- Please make sure she gets them.
- They wouldn't let me mail them.
- David...
Well?
He's not there.
He's not anywhere.
His note said that he'd be back on Sunday.
He's in some sort of trouble. I'm afraid.
So am I.
I was on my way to the bus station.
And I wanted to talk to you.
May I come in?
I heard about you and Keith.
What he said.
It wasn't fair.
He said you hate me. Is it true?
I don't hate you, David.
You shouldn't be here.
You're still on parole. I don't want you to be
in any more trouble because of me.
I had to see you again.
You haven't changed.
I love you.
I don't deserve it.
I never wrote you.
I never even called your family.
I probably wouldn't have gotten
your letters anyway.
I got yours.
Ann gave them to me.
I read all of them.
I felt like I ruined your life.
We can talk about that sometime.
I can't handle it now.
There won't be any sometime.
It was a once-in-a-lifetime thing,
David.
I know that.
And it came at a time when we were both
too young to handle it.
That was the terrible part.
Jade.
I had to say goodbye to my father.
I never thought I could do that.
- I'll be all right.
- Where are you going?
Back to school.
It's in Burlington.
That's up in Vermont.
The bus leaves in an hour.
Don't go.
Stay.
I don't know when
we'll see each other again.
I can't.
I really must go.
Goodbye, David.
You have to let it go.
Go back to Chicago.
Please take care of yourself.
Please say goodbye.
Please...
No. No.
Jade!
- David, no, please...
- Don't go. Please stay with me.
I don't care what happens to me.
All I care about is you.
- Please, no...
- Don't you see? I can't let you go.
It's not over. We're not finished.
It won't work. It's all over.
Look at me. Look at me.
Jade, we're not finished.
- No!
- I know you still love me.
David, look at me.
David, look at me. You're right.
You're right.
I love you.
It'll be weird going back to Chicago.
Do you ever go by the house?
I've thought about it.
I'm glad I'll be going back with you.
It'll mean it's all over,
like it never even happened.
- It happened.
- What?
Nothing.
Come here.
Yeah, what room is David Axelrod in?
David Axelrod.
Yeah.
David, it's Keith.
I'm in the lobby. You wanna
come downstairs a moment, please?
Tell Jade to come with you.
He'll be downstairs in just a minute.
Tell Jade exactly what you told me.
I told you. I wasn't sure.
- I don't want to do this.
- Come on. I know it's him.
Look, it all makes sense.
Keith, I want to know what happened too
but I want to be fair about it.
Ingrid.
It was him.
- You were right there.
- What?
You were standing right there.
I touched you.
- What?
- Jade, you think this was a coincidence?
What are you talking about?
He was in town and your father was killed.
- I know.
- You think this was coincidence.
- Jade, he was standing right there.
- Ingrid saw him there.
She saw him. This bastard was standing
right there. That's why Pap ran out...
- Pappy's dead because of him.
- No.
He killed your father.
David?
I was there.
It was an accident.
- Jade, listen to me. Let me explain.
- Get your goddamn hands off her.
- Jade, it was an accident.
- You goddamn son of a bitch!
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Let me tell you what happened.
I didn't do anything.
Dirty bastard! I'll kill you!
You killed my father.
Keith! It wasn't his fault.
Step aside. Police, Police.
Somebody get him off.
Let go of me.
That bastard burnt down my house.
He's on fucking parole.
Damn you, let me go!
Jade! Jade!
Don't hurt him!
- Jade!
- Stop that...
Jade!
- Go on, boy. You get in.
- Jade!
You know what I keep thinking about?
The night at the house.
Pappy played the trumpet that night
and I was with him.
I was his little girl.
And then I saw David all alone.
And I don't know. I just...
I wanted to go to him. Was it wrong?
No.
I wasn't Pappy's little girl any more.
Something had changed.
For the first time in my life, I was me.
Life goes on. We change.
But I hurt.
- I hurt so much.
- Oh, baby.
It all happened so fast for you.
But you'll have a lifetime to understand it.
But he loved me.
He loves me.
No one'll ever love me like that.
You'll always be loved. You'll see.
Not like that.
Not like David.
Not like David.
I can't help you very much.
I wish I could.
But you deserve...
What?
Anything.
Everything.
You have to find out for yourself.
My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right
My first love
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make
And I
I
I want to share
All my love
With you
No one else will do
And your eyes
Your eyes
They tell me how much you care
Oh, yes
You will always be
My endless love
Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
Forever
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms
And, love
Oh, love
I'll be a fool for you
I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh, you know I don't mind
Cos you
You mean the world to me
Oh, I know
I know
I've found in you
I've found in you
My endless love
Oh, and, love
Oh, love
I'll be that fool for you
I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh, you know I don't mind
And yes
You'll be the only one
Cos no one can deny
No one can deny
This love I have inside
I'll give it all to you
My love
My love
My love
My endless love
