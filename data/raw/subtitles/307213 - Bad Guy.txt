Hi! Come in.
I'll show you a good time!
Hi! Come on! Come!
What are you doing?
Do you want me to help you?

Come on. Stay still.
Please stop! Wait!
Stay still.
- Wait!

What? I see.
Stop.
- Oh.

Sorry, sir.
She is not trained yet.
I'll send another one.
I Iike this one.
Get out before I pluck
your eyeballs out.
Get Iost!
What are you doing?
Who told you to treat
the customers in that way?
I need to ask you a favour.
I have a boyfriend that I Iike a Iot.
I want...
..my first time to be with him.
What's up? What is this car for?
Don't say anything.
Just hold me.
Wait. Why are you Iike this
all of a sudden?
- Hyeon-su!
- What's going on?
Get out!
- What? What is this?
- No, no!
Hyeon-su! Hyeon-su!
Hyeon-su!
Hi there! Come on in.
Come here and have some fun. Hi!
Come on! I'll show you a good time.
Aren't you going to take off
the rest?
Hey, take this off.
Hold still.
Hold still!
Go away, you son of a bitch.
She should know
she's only worth 50 bucks.
It's Iike doing it with a stiff.
Don't just cry, move.
We should get some rice wine
on a day Iike this.
Come and have a drink.
You know, Seon-hwa...
..she gets prettier and prettier.
It was my dream to go out
with a college girl.
I didn't want to pay you to do it
but otherwise, you wouldn't do it.
Now I know it feels different
with a college girl.
I feel responsible for making
you Iike this.
Men shouldn't behave so badly.
I feel guilty when I see you.
What are you talking about?
About a month ago,
in front of a mall, you slapped
a guy on the face and spat on him.
Well, Iet's not talk about it.
It already happened.
Cool paintings.
- You son of a bitch!
- Cut it out!
You motherfucker!
Seon-hwa.
I did it because I really Iike her.
What's wrong with that?
What are you doing?
I don't need to stay
in a place Iike this.
A place Iike this?
Do as I say...
- Why? What are you?
- Unpack! Shit!
Why are you doing this
to another woman?
Do you want to be Iike me,
who can't go to a public bath?
Drink.
What are you doing?
Do it slowly...
Hi, come in.
I'll show you a good time.
Why don't you come in?
Come in.
What's wrong with this guy?
What's with that?
Come again, darling. Bye!
Han-gi, come here.
Something's weird.
Shit, we're in trouble.
It's strange. It feels Iike
somebody is watching me.
What's this?
A hidden camera?
When they show...
..a murderer's face on TV,
do you know why it is blurred?
Are these girls worse than murderers?
You fuckers!
I'm sorry.
Jeong-tae's father got Iiver cancer
and couldn't pay his bills.
Sorry...
I'm at work.
What? Where are you?
Come here! I'll show you
a good time. Come on in!
Long time, no see. How have you been?
You've Iost weight.
Sorry.
What's your name?
Let's go in.
You bitch! Get out!
You're so rude.
Is there anyone that
doesn't need money here?
You may be pretty.
Does that make you superior?
Give me that.
This bitch should Iearn a Iesson.
- What are you doing?
- Shit.
Go back to work.
Be quiet.
What are you crying for?
If you do it again,
you'll have to fend for yourself.
Jeong-tae, I'll tell Han-gi that
I want to go out with Seon-hwa.
What do you think?
I don't know.
I need to talk to you.
I Iike Seon-hwa a Iot.
I'll go out with her.
Even if it goes well
and I marry her,
I won't be mad at you
for making her a hooker.
I am to blame
for making you Iike this.
- I want to take responsibility.
- What are you talking about?
It's not just guilt.
I really Iike you.
- Nonsense. Get out.
- Don't you believe me?
- I really Iike you.
- I don't want to hear this.
Seon-hwa, stay still.
- You're driving me crazy, Seon-hwa.
- Wait!
- Do you really Iike me?
- Of course.
Then Iet me escape.
If you really Iike me,
you will do it.
What if I don't see you again?
If you Iet me go,
I'll see you, I promise.
Really?
Myeong-su!
Jeong-tae, Iisten to me.
Wait!
Let her go. Let me go.
Jeong-tae, Iisten to me!
Help me!
What did I do wrong?
Would you just Iet the girl you Iove
Iive Iike that?
- Myeong-su, can I get a drink?
- Go back to work.
Shit!
You didn't do anything wrong.
Then why did you try to catch her?
Sorry.
That's alright.
Han-gi will get her anyway.
Here.
Shit.
I wish she'd come back.
Seeing her go,
I felt Iike I'd never see her again.
Hey! Come on.
I'll show you a good time.
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!
Get inside!
Hey, don't drink! You want to get
Iiver cancer Iike your old man?
How did the operation go?
He survived.
Thank you, Han-gi.
Have a drink, Han-gi.
Sorry about the other day.
I really Iike Seon-hwa.
I'm glad you brought her back.
Have another one.
Dal-su will be coming out soon.
Han-gi, it's about time.
If he comes back,
it'll be Iike the old days again.
He'll blackmail customers
and film them with whores.
We made more money then.
We're going back in.
Let's go.
Run, run, run!
- Come here.
- It's hot. Go away.
Don't eat this part. It tastes bad.
You're ruining it.
Don't make a mess. Go away.
Doesn't this part taste better?
The white part.
Here's another one.
But it was good, right?
Will you become a regular?
I'll buy you this. Drink up.
Come here. We've got some girls!
- Be good to him while he's alive.
- You be good.
- It's quiet tonight.
- Yeah, not too many customers.
Oh, there's Dal-su.
Wait! I'll come in with you.
Well, you've been here a Iong time,
haven't you.
- How old are you?
- I don't know.
- You could be on TV.
- Cut it out.
You behave Iike this when I say
you're pretty? Bitch! What is this?
Alright, alright. Stay there.
- What?
- Stay there.
Hey, Jeong-tae.
Where are your manners?
You are embarrassing us. Get out.
What? You rude bastard!
Son of a bitch!
What's this? Han-gi?
Let go of me. Let go, you fucker!
Let go, you son of a bitch!
Let go, you fucker!
Boss!
You haven't changed.
I'm telling you,
clear the container by next week.
Come and have fun here!
Come here and have fun!
Come here!
You really seemed to Iike it.
Are you often Iike that?
Can I be your regular?
Come in and have some fun!
Hey, it's been a while!
- Hi, Daddy-o, come here.
- You with the tie, come on in.
Hi! Have fun here.
Wasn't it for me?
Come in! Let's have fun.
Han-gi, where are you going?
Han-gi!
Han-gi! Han-gi!
Carry him, carefully.
Those fuckers.
Don't we need to do something?
Are you really going to do it?
Don't do it if you don't want to.
You're serious! That's crazy.
Hello, sir!
Give me a cigarette.
Here you are.
Look at the way he's staring at me.
What's wrong with you?
That's the way his eyes are.
The way his eyes are? Son of a bitch!
- Are you kidding, you bastard?
- Cut it out, son of a bitch!
You've got a problem.
- You do the police job.
- Come on.
You'll get a death sentence
because of your record.
I won't because it's my first time.
I should tell the police.
Otherwise Han-gi will be executed.
Han-gi would have killed him
with or without you. Don't be a fool.
Aren't you going to work?
Bitch!
What's the matter?
He's the one that made you Iike this.
Aren't you pleased?
Do you have something
you want to say to him?
You can't die Iike this!
You ruin me...
..and then die, just Iike that?
Get out of there!
Get out as soon as possible!
Hurry up!
You filthy bastard!
Get yourself out of there,
you son of a bitch!
Hurry!
You son of a bitch!
Hurry up and get out of there!
You can't die Iike this!
Get out!
Get out of there! Hurry!
Go away. I'll Iet you go.
Hello, sir.
You! Come here.
Why are you Iooking at me Iike that?
- I'm smiling.
- How come your smile is so nasty?
Don't mind him. That's the way he is.
Bullshit! Son of a bitch!
This way, sir.
- Sorry to trouble you.
- Shit. Why me?
Come here and have fun!
Hey! What's wrong?
What's this?
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
- Han-gi, Han-gi.
- What are you Iooking at? Come on!
You motherfucker!
Show some respect!
What are you in here for?
Are you Iistening to me,
you fucker?
What are you Iooking at?
- Hey! Get him.
- OK.
You son of a bitch!
Don't worry. I'm here.
565, come out.
Come out!
Hurry! This way.
Stay still!
Looks Iike another one's
being hanged.
Han-gi, Han-gi!
- Han-gi!
- Keep walking.
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop that! Stop!
Open the door!
What? What are you doing?
You crazy fool.
You hit a man about to be executed.
Call the prosecutor.
- Come in!
- Come and have some fun.
Seon-hwa!
Let me ask you something.
How much do you make a month?
Have you saved some?
Tell me. How much you have saved?
Get out! Son of a bitch, get out!
Hey, hey! What?
What's the matter with you?
Are you crazy?
Han-gi came out today.
Why did you do it?
You shouldn't have.
You knew I Iiked Seon-hwa.
How could you? Fuck!
You made Jeong-tae a murderer.
What have you done for us?
Fuck! Tell me!
- Go back to work! What's wrong?
- I'm just having a coffee.
- Shit! Bitches!
- What did you hit me for? Shit!
- Hey, you!
- Yeah?
- What do you think of Han-gi?
- He's a good person.
Oh!
What's up with you tonight?
You're drunk.
Shit!
Speak of the devil...
Fuck!
Say that again, you fucker!
I said, "Fuck!" So what?
You fucker!
Eun-hye, Eun-hye! Hurry!
Han-gi is beating up Myeong-su.
Stop them!
- Fucker. Fuck!
- Stop them!
Stop them!
Stop it! Don't be an idiot.
Stop!
You motherfucker!
Bastard!
How can a Iowlife be Ioved?
You fucker!
How can a Iowlife... be Ioved.
