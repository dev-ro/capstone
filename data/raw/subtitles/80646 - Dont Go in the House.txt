-? The flames?
- Do you have trouble 
- Yes.
Let me help you with this.
Do you believe in the devil?
What question is that 
for hacérsela a priest?
Do you think?
If I believe in evil, but not the devil.
But I saw the devil.
No, it's in your mind, Donny.
The devil is just a 
symbol. A symbol of evil.
Evil lives only if we let him.
- So do not think there 
- No.
Does not exist.
Unless you want there.
You have an answer for everything.
Everything you read in books.
All the things that tells people.
Watch these symbols.
I went burned like hell.
What's this? What 
happened to your arm?
It was the punishment for my sins.
Who did this?
Tell me.
My mother.
My mother!
Help me.
You say your mother 
did this? But why?
Because I was bad.
I was born with a seed of evil.
She was burning to save.
If it was bad ...
she burned me.
If you had bad thoughts ...
she burned me.
Do you understand me?
But Donny, we 
forgive those who have sinned.
You must forgive your mother.
Donny.
I want to help. Do you believe in me?
- If 
-. You want my help?
Yes.
Then do what I say.
Let these thoughts 
bad out of your mind now.
Resist them and find peace.
Do not you want that?
Yes.
Yes, I want.
But other things.
Other people.
Come see me.
Come to my office or 
confessional, if you prefer.
Long time did not come.
Just come back to me.
Mother, please forgive me.
I told the priest because 
he wanted to help.
I did nothing wrong.
I can change.
I want to forget our past.
I forgive you.
Please.
Help me to forgive her.
