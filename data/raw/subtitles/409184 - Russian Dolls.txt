#Shit !!!#
#30 years old... Time to make a summary...#
#If I see my life,now,in a hurry,
not much thing to remember...#
#What do I have left ?#
#I've been mad of love for a girl, Martine.
.. No,no,no, that's not the point...#
#Too, I've been mad of love for
another one, later, called Neus.#
#Well, OK, I'm messed up concerning true love.
.. And that's because I'm messed up too.#
#Well, I'm going to do a little bit of tidying,
after all, that's all about writting.#
"Writting,it's tidying the mess of one's life"#
#In a hurry, I'm not going to put it in
good order, because good order is messed up#
#So this is me...One month ago,
I was in Russia for a wedding.#
#These are all people I met 5 years ago...#
#Actually, 5 year ago I went to Barcelona,
I finisehd my Economics study there.#
#Well, anyway, it's there that I met all these
guys : I shared a flat with them during 1 year#
#We had forgotten about each others since few
years and we all met here, in Saint Petersburg#
#because William, HIM there, gets married
tomorrow with a russian girl, Natasha, HER  #
#And so, in a few seconds, an
incredible event will change my life...#
#Something really fundamental#
#But so that I can explain why this
thing is fundamental for me, the best
is to go backwards one year ago...#

#That's it. Now I write,
my job is to tell stories.#
#But since a few years,it's in that woman's
office that I tell my best stories.#
#HER, she's Miss Vanpetegen,my banker...#
> So that's the reason why they told
me they would pay me in two months...
But they told me
- and I think this will interess you, Miss
Vanpetegen,cause I'm like you
I told them : "This is outrageous, you're not
allowed to do that, there is a very strict
juridiction concerning authors in France"
because I was very very upset you know...
> Wait a minute... What was supposed
to be interesting for me here ?
> I was coming to it...So they told me that .
.. they felt guilty for not paying me in time
that when they would give me my payment, they
would give it to me considering the fact that
they considered it like delay indemnities
> What do you mean ? I don't understand...
> Euh... Considering the fact that
there was delay, they will pay me
more, even if I'm not working more...
> Did they tell you how much more ?
> Oh yes, I think they told
it would be much much much ...
#So basically, nowadays, my job
is essentialy to tell fibs.#
> Typically, we need authors like you for
personalities who write there memoirs but
who in fact don't write a single line...
Would you know how to do that ?
> Heu... Beeing a nigger ? Hum...
Yes, no but this is... Yes, I can
be a nigger? I already did that...
#In fact, I was able to
be nigger of ... anybody#
> I prefered going to work there ...
It was in Barcelona ... in relation
with language, this is important ...
All that is fiction, but related to
reality ... Otherwise, I think it
is fascinating, euh, True things...
Life, real life,... Traveling,
litterature, people...
#This is my job... By that way, I
managed to work in many different places#
> Plum-colour is about, hum, curvature,
warmth, a relative feminity, but with
elegance and control...
> Cause you know, in glide word, there are
stuffs kind of hot-dog, or more freestyle.
So we don't have the same equipment...
> Hardware has always been very reliable,
Operating System makes the difference...
> No, concerning ride !
> Do you mean, concerning
what you're carrying away ?
> It's cheap without being "prout-prout", it's
hype (fashion), but remains cool and relax...
> For me, the real pleasure
for me is freestyle !
> It's the colour...hein ?!
> Doesn't it kill trees
to cut them that way ? ...
And how ...? Do you prune trees like
that several times in the year ?
> What do you think ?
> Heu... Yes ? No ? I don't know,
I don't know anything about it...
> Does grape grow up in winter ?
> Ok, stop it now, you've been
laughing at me since one hour... I'm
parisian, I don't know anything about
But I'm just like you : I have a fucking job
that I have to do and that is so boring for me...
And I don't give a shit about asking you
questions, so if you don't want to answer or
if you think my questions are stupid, I go
> Done ? Aren't you a bit overtaxed ?
> Sorry. Bad night... Bad sleep... I
had a bad day, yes, I'm overtaxed...
> Don't give me that ! Nothing
to do with parisians...
> This is parisians, hey ?!
> Laurent, stop, it's ok, facade is cleared !
So when do you have to give
back this fucking story ?
> In 15 days...
#I don't know why, people must believe
I'm good at telling love story, cause
it's what they ask me more...#
> We could do a special serial about
love with young authors for summer...
> Yeah, I'm definitely in it !
#So this last year, things went quite good : I
even got a job for TV to write a scenario...#
#Well, it's kinda consecration in fact...#
> So, we all read with
much interest your story...
but despite of the fact we found
very good qualities, there's a few
stages which surprised us a little...
> Actually, not just a little...
> So : Stage 57 : we all wonder why
Jean-Edouard and Odile don't kiss
in the scene of storm in Venice...
> Yes, why that ? Cause we want them to
kiss... Anyhow, I wanted them to kiss...
> I don't know... I just didn't
want it to be too cliché...
Well,it's so evident that I thought
in might be more interesting if
nothing happened for a while...
>I'm sorry, I disagree with you : why would
we refuse this pleasure to our audience ?
This movie is for Christmas ; it's a fantastic
present we want to offer to the spectator, we
shouldn't be afraid of cliché, Xavier !
>No,I'm supraOK !
>You musn't forget it's a following :
"Retour au bois joli" was a real success,
so for "Passion d'amour à Venise",
there is a very big expectancy from
audience, you've got to go, he ?!
>Everybody needs to know how Jean-Edouard
and Odile will at least fall in love !
Think : Jean-Edouard is good looking, Odile
is good looking, they are in Venise, one of
the most beautiful cities in the world...
You know Venise, don't you ? Go Xavier,
don't be afraid ! People like postcards !
Everybody likes sunsets,
why would you refuse that ?
Put them on gondolas, hey ?
>I have to send the "domaine du Bois-Joli"
>Why Jean-Edouard ?... Why ?
>I'm going to divorce
>But does your wife know about it ?
>Yes, I told her everything...
>Oh, this is marvellous !!!
>Pfff... Ridiculous !
>No, it's not ridiculous,...
>Think...
>You don't like love stories, you think
it's ridiculous, but many people like love
stories and don't think it's ridiculous !
>So you accepted to create
the following of that...
>Yeah !
>Well, I hope you're well paid then...
>I am, it's better paid than my articles...
>And your book, it's over, isn't it ?
>I can't do everything at the same time,
that's all... Lucas, do you like it ?
>Yes, I like it.
#Well, of course, it was not what I
was dreaming of, but I think it's
just a step : I learn, I learn a lot.#
>Who could that be ? 
>Are you waiting for somebody ?
>No...

Everybody says who he is on

"It's your mother","It's your mom" ?

Actually, I don't know if she wears size 1 or 2
>I don't know, it depends
if she's thinner than me.
Is she ... like that girl over there ?
>No, euh, more like that girl
over there, but less ugly, eh ?!
>Ok, look, take size 2, anyway, your
girlfriend can still exchange it !

>Come on, let's go !
>Well, thank you ! It's very nice cause
it's been week that it's dying on my
balcony and I don't know what to do.
>Of course, but flowers need attention, he ?! 
>It's incredible, people think nature
is growing all by itself ! But No !
We humans have to take care of it !
And by the way, Forbe is a classical
one : people always give it too much
water. Less than one sprinkle a week !
>But I'll come to your home and I will tell
you,he ?! >Thank you, it's really nice...
#Here it is : to begin, it's that day
that she met that guy, that Mr. Plane
Tree, but moreover, afterwards...#
>Yes, just a minute !
#Yes, so, it's that day that Martine
had to leave for Bresil, as if my
life was not already enough untidy...#
>Happy to have at least recovered the
prince, she accepted to marry him.
The wedding lasted an entire week and all
inhabitants of the kingdom were conveyed.
They lived a long time in their
beautiful chateau and got many children.
>Well, now you have to sleep Lucas,
do you want to go to the toilets ?
Oh, Lucas, do you want to go
to toilets before sleeping ?
>And mum, she still didn't
find a prince, did she ?
>Oh, I don't know, she
didn't tell you about it ? No
>Well, so she didn't find one... But it's
not grave you know : she's beautiful,
she's intelligent, you have a...
#If only he knew how much
I had loved his mother...#
A beautiful castle... #I
guess Martine didn't tell him#
#How could she explain that ?#
>So, I've dated 7 guys, well, 7 princes,
... and I lived in several chateaux
And Xavier is the fourth prince
I've known... And today,hum...
I'm on several guys at the same time, several
princes, I don't really know, I hesite...
I met one last week in diskoteka.
.. Well, it's like a bal, a big
bal, and I attracts him a lot.
Well, he doesn't have an enormous
chateau but he has a big motorbike.
Hey, you would like it, he ?!
And... It's complicated... 
Even if things went well between us,
it's still too early to know if
there will be a wedding, you see ?
And moreover, many people in the
kingdom say that if it's him,
they won't come to the wedding...
>Don't cry mum.
>What's wrong Lucas ?
>And what do we do with apple : You
want more, you don't want anymore ?
>I don't want anymore >There
is some left, hey ?!>Yes
>You don't want anymore...
>Oh, look who's coming ! It's mum !
>Well, he has been very ill, he's so
tired, he needs to sleep >Does he ?
>So, I'll put him in bed. I'm
so tired ! Me too I'm tired !!!
>The doctor came cause I was ill.
>So how was Porto Alegre ? >It
was fantastic ! Can you imagine
216 countries were represented ?!
>Every continents were present :
Chili, Mali, Monte Negro, Tibet...
It was so touching to assist to that.
You really feel like you're a part
of this planet when you see that!
>So, did you all agree to save the
world which is running to it's end ?!
>Wait... You can laugh at that, but
it's a fact today that globalisation
is not only a source of progress.
And that it's important to join
to fight against disasters that
can very fast become ineluctable.
>Impressive, you know your text !
>What's up with you ? Why are you upset ?
>Because me, meanwhile you're saving the
world, I take care of your son who is ill
and that it's been 3 nights that
I didn't sleep, and that I...
>You what ?! You don't do anything and you
have never done anything of your life !
>Me?! >What do you think your
doing with your stupid love story ?
You give dreams to young teenage girls
who read their stupid books in the train !
"They kissed in front the
sunset..." >Bullshit !
What kind of dream do you give
them ? Only shit in rods !
You know what Xavier ? What you
do is stupid, everything that
you write since 2 years is stupid
And if I tell you that, it's because
I know you could do much better !
>Wait, I... >No, You don't care
: you make your bacon alone, you
are cool, everything is perfect !
It's so easy criticize when one's move and
fight against pollution, exclusion, violence...
against real stuff of real life ! It's so easy
for somebody like you to jibe, for sure...
>I'm not jibing... >You
are just a parasite >What ?
>You are a parasite!!! You are cool in
your hammock chair telling your stupid
love story and...it's perfect for you.
Well, please don't change anything,
it seems to satisfy you...
>Prosim? >Yes, it's me...
Pardon me,hey ? Really...
And... Well, thank you for Lucas... I...
>I have a twin brother, Jean-Sebastien,
he looks just like me...
>Oh, yes, this is good...
Fuck...
>Do you want to go ? Yes, maybe.
>Are you ok ?
>How could I write a love story ?!
I don't know anything about love...
I'm an egoist, I care only for my
ass... >Euh, no... >Yes, I do...
>Die pozor ! Hang me strongly
! >I do, let's go now.
>Be careful, here we have to stop, we'll cross
in two times... >ok >Otherwise it's dangerous.
>Tell me, when do you introduce me to
your fiancée? >Oh, yes, I forgot again...
>How come ? You shouldn't forget,
it's important ! >Yes, I know.
#When will you introduce me to your fiancé ?#
#I don't know why but that question
my grandfather was asking me
everytime was becoming an obsession.#
#I thought I had to find the good girl,
fast, very fast, before he dies.#
>Hi, Katia ? >Oh ok, sorry... >Really ?
But when will she come back from Senegal?
Forget about it, it was
Xavier. No, thank you, bye !
>What's up ? >Could you come just a
second ? I have something to ask you.
>I'm coming.
>Are you ok? Did you have a good
day ? >What do you want Xavier ?
>Look I have a very big favour to
ask you. Something you'll hate to do,
but that you must accept to do...
>What is it ? >I was wondering : in
all your clothes, do you have a dress ?
>A dress ?! >Ok, forget about
it, it won't be possible...
>Shit, this will be hard... >I have no dress !
What do you want me to do with a
dress ? >Forget about it, I'm sorry.
>We agreed, you don't crack out
at some moment, shouting "I can't
continue, I'm a lesbian", ok ?
>Stop, I'm here, it's ok ! >I'm
just warning you, that's all...
>Yes, but I'm not far from drop it all, I
wonder what I'm doing here... It's just
ridiculous
>No, it's not ridiculous ! >Yes it is !
>Would you like me to go back
to the car to get it, my love ?
>Oh, no, there's no need, we'll
go later... after the dinner.
But it's very nice from you muy sweetheart.
>Well, I guess we can do it
very well by another way...
>Oh, this is very beautiful here !
>Stop that Isabelle, you're not
going to talk that way, he ?
>It's the way you wanted me to behave.
>Stop, try to keep focused !
I put my finger on the bell... >Ok, ok
>Hey, what are you doing, I'm not ready !
>It's so nice to meet you !Please come in !
Come in, don't stay in the entrance !
Oh, be careful ! >Sorry, fuck ! >Hello my boy
Follow me, I'm so happy to meet
you ! >Oh, me too, really !
Oh, it's really very beautiful
here ! >Stop, don't talk that way !
>Do you want to know my
age ? I'm 98. I saw 3 wars.
>Oh, this is wonderful, extraordinary.
.. >Yes, I was born in 1906. >1906?
>But we shouldn't talk about
me, I don't want to be boring.
Can you imagine ? If I told you
my life, it would take hours !
Let's talk about you, Mademoiselle, I'm so
happy my grandson has a fiancée, so pretty !
>Oh, no...I'm not... >Oh yes, I
insist ! Very pretty ! >Well, thanks
a lot, it's very nice from you.
>So, tell me what you do in life.
>Well... I work for a TV channel
where I am financial journalist.
So, what does it mean ? It means that
I work in the world of stock exchange.
That's it : I collect a whole set
of little pieces of information
about financial markets, stock,
Things to sell, things to buy... 
because traders need... euh, people who work
in stock exchange need a lot of info...rmation.
about many different... subjects.
>But who is interested by that ?
>Oh, many people : you have to know that there
is 450 managment companies only in Paris...
It's a very competitive sector :
everybody is fighting against everybody
and everybody need these informations.
Moreover, it's a world where everything
goes very fast, a lot of money floats...
For example, once, I knew before
everybody that certain asiatic
financial markets were collapsing.
So I had to react like that, immediately,...
and for all operators who manage assets,
it can make the same effect as a bomb.
Then you have to be present, cause any
information you give can have enormous
consequences on planete's economy !
What ?
>Hold firm just one more hour, we'll
have dinner now, just one hour please !
>No ! We leave ! >Come on,
one hour, it's not long !
>Hey, I understood now why you were
hiding ! Come here, let's have dinner...
>Go first >No, You go first ! >Go first !
>Come, come please come !
>I feel dirty ! Being a prude...
I'm sorry to tell you that Xavier, but the
woman you're looking for doesn't exist !
You have to grow up, it's like you
wanted to find a princess, or even
worse : an heroin of serial...
But you have to stop dreaming Xavier,
princess only exist in fairy tales
What we've done is really stupid.
>Why should I stop dreaming ?
>Isabelle, let's go out, shall we ? >Oh, yes,
cause now... But this time, I choose what we
do.
>Make him very beautiful !
>I thank you : after I feel just like the
king of the world and I don't want to...
>Oh, you guys are ok !
>Xavier is quite hot like that !
>We go to bed
>Are you ok ? >Yep, I'm fine.
>Waou, your wife is going to be pretty !
>Yep, when will she be ready, my wife ?
>Oh, it's enough...
>That's it, it's better like that,
isn't it ? >Ok, I understood !
>Come on, move your ass !
>It fits quite good on him !
>Oh, I didn't introduce you to my
wife ! Darling, here's my secretary...
>Oh, my phone... >Is it yours
darling ? >Yes, it's mine...
>Prosim ? >Prosim ? Is it Xavier
on line ? >Hi, yes it's me.
>Oh my sweety chick !
>Euh, no, it's Isabelle...
>Are you ok ? >Yes, yes, why ? >I
don't know, you have a small voice...
>It's just that Lucas' father
just came to pick him up and...
>Oh, super >And... Lucas sleeps
there >Well, it's quite good he
came to take his son, isn't it ?
>My wife spends much of her time on
phone... But it could be her lover.
>And now I'm alone >But who
is calling you so late ?
>But it's important for your
son not to see only women...
>Yes, of course, it's great, but it's
just that... Can i come to see you ?
>Euh... Yes, come over here, no
really come, you won't derange.
>You have make up ! >Do I ? Oh, no, I
don't know... >But it's cute, hey ?!
>I see you have fun between
girlfriends ! >So what's wrong ?
>Hi Martine ! How are you doing ? >Hi, how
are you ? >Oh, I'm happy to see you, come in !
>Come in, we'll sit down.
>You know what ? It's really funny
cause last week, somebody offered
me Martine at camping and...
I didn't have this one !
>To sum up, it's not easy...
People must think we are stranded
heterosexual ! >Well, they may be right !
>Wait, I think this is a very bad
idea... >It's just for tonight.
>No, I assure you, we are really
doing something stupid >Ho, you
are really stranded actually !
>I'm not stranded, I just don't desire
it ! It's just a matter of envy.
I like you very much but I dont' want
to have sex with you again, that's it.
And you neither, by the way, I don't
know why you want to do that...
>I have the feeling I'm irritating. >You're
not ! >I will never find a boyfriend.
You're right, I'm to annoying.
I just got separated from Bruno.
Did I tell you about him ?
>Euh... I'm sorry but presently, you're
changing so usually that... I can't follow
you...
>But I don't understand : since you, I can't
find a boy who would be ... I don't know...
>It's because you are too demanding. You're
looking for a perfect guy who doesn't exist.
You believe in Santa Claus. You're grown up
Martine ! Stop believing in Mr. Perfect !
React, react !!
>Come, let's go in my room.
>What's happening to you ? Why are
you crying for so stupid thing ?
You are annoying, it's a fact, but still
: you're pretty, you're intelligent...
I don't know, many guys are like you
so much ! >Oh, I don't give a damn !
>Imagine if you were boring, ugly, very
stupid and that you didn't please anybody...
I would understand but things aren't so bad !
>Who are these guys who like
me ? >Well, I don't know...
Hey, Patrick for example, he
told me he was crazy about you.
>Did he ? >Yeah !
>He told you : "Martine makes me crazy" ?!
>Yes ! You look suprised ! You have
something attractive you know !
>Oh, it's ok, you tell it as if...
Can I sleep with you tonight ?
Prosim...
>Ok, if you want...
>Oh, shit !!!
>Oh, thank you, I'm happy
to have stayed with you.
>Yeah, well actually, you can't stay here now,
cause a girlfriend of mine will arrive soon.
>What then ? It's not a problem... 
>Just tell her the truth. That we are
old friends and we didn't have sex.
>Yes, of course. >Is she your girlfriend ? >Yep
>Hum... So you have a girl
friend... >No, not really
>Is she or isn't she your girlfriend ?
>I don't have A girlfriend, I have
girlfriends ! What do you want ?!
>No, do you have a girlfriend or not ?
>I have none, I have many, am I clear ?
>Ouh... I had forgotten how you were !
Get worked up alone ! It's ok, I go !
>Yes, go I told you, cause she
will arrive and it will be a mess !
Wait, I'm sorry but I have my life,
you didn't let me time this night
that this morning would be a mess !
Cau, sorry for what I told you, I was worked
up, and afraid you could see each other.
>It's ok, I understand...
>Who is she ? >She's nobody
>Am I nobody ?! Am I nobody ?! 
Look, you have you life, I have mine, no
problem, but for me you will always be
someone !
Always ! In front of anybody.
>Who is she, Xavier ?
>She's nobody, just my ex-girlfriend,
Martine, I already talked to you about her.
>Not so "ex" as you tell, i can see...
>Yes, she's my ex, it's finished,
totally finished, come on, enter !
>One enters, one goes out... It
doesn't seem to be a problem for you...
>No, you can't understand...
>Actually, you are a guy who likes to get many
girls, aren't you ? You just don't care...
>Yes, exactly, I'm a guy like that,
and if it's a problem, you can leave.
>Is that a way to talk to me ?
>YES, IT IS !!! Because you're all
annoying, you're all stupid... And,...
Do you understand that ? SO LEAVE !!!
>Asswhole >Yes, yes, I'm an asswhole, yes !
>What's wrong with you, how can you
talk to them that way ? Are you stupid ?
>Wait, who is that girl, what am
I ? This is none of you business !
>Calm down Xavier, she
didn't do anything to you...
>Wait, I what ?! What
allows her to talk to me ?
You, it's your home, I don't care if you take
your prostitutes at home, but they are not...
>Shit, Xavier ?!
>It's not easy for a middle
aged woman to find a good man
Good men are unusual nowadays,
you know... >Yes, yes, I know...
>I will introduce you to him but you
don't say anything, no comment, ok ?
>Come one mum, it' s ok, you're not 15 !
I know what it is not to find
the good person at first try !
Don't be afraid, on that
subject, I'm experienced !
Anyway, humans are a strange species...
Did you know that hippopotamus
choose another hippopotamus and stay
their whole life with the same one ?
Did you know it ? >No...
>It's marvellous, isn't it ? >Yep...
>Is it here ?! >Yes >Does he live here ?
>Yes, he does. >And you too
? >Since 3 months today.
>Waou, now I understand ! >What do you
understand ? >I understand why he's a good
man !
>Oh, stop that, will you ? >Hey,
I know why you are with him !
>You told you wouldn't make any comment.
>Are you freaking out ? >No
! >Yes you're freaking out !
>You're the one who is going to freak
me out for real if you keep going !
>Before it was easy, world was shared
in two parts : Capitalists/Marxists,
exploiters/exploited, right/left.
Well, it was a pretty good order. But
today, all these oppositions are over !
Actually,today, you have : the world
of people who show naked women and the
world of people who try to hide them !
Actually, the real opposition in today's
world is here : on the image we have of women.
>Yep, this is not false...
#Well, I had managed to finish
a new version of the senario.#
#But when I arrived in France Télévision,
a little surprise was waiting for me...#
#They told me that an Australian
satellite bouquet,... or Deutch#
>TelSetsi is the silent partner of
channel télépassion through the
numerical bouquet Eurosat 2000...
>I'll be right back...
#Yes, that's the point : it was a story of
buying back a bouquet by some company...#
#But in any case, Passion d'Amour à Venise
had became a co-production with BBC2#
#So scénario had to be in english from now on.#
>Waou, so much...
#Something had occured with their
counterparts from BBC, they were
gathering a pool of scenarists...#
#Anyway, I still had the pleasure to hear :#
>We are sorry, cause we know how much you
were personnaly involved in that project...
#But he specified me that all that was
due to hazardousness of globalisation.#
>You're a victim of globalisation,
Xavier... #It comforted me...#
>Wait, I do speak english !
>What do you mean ? Do you think that you
can keep writting the scénario in english ?
>Of course I can, I can write in english, I
already wrote several scénari in english !
>Can we see it to submit
it to our co-producer ?
>Yes, euh... Actually it's gonna be
complicated cause... I wrote these
scénari when I was in Barcelona for a...
>By the way, I think the production
company of edition went bankrupt...
#That's it : a love story,
it's first of all a story...#
>I was given the name of your english
scénarist, they knew her very well...
>Oh, really ?
>So, they accept the idea of your
collagoration, you may go to London as soon
as you want.
>I took care of everything : your trips
will be repaid to you and for your fees in
london, it shouldn't be a problem neither.
>Perfect ! Dakujem !
>I think we owe that to you...
#I've always known that Wendy was like a
sister, like a mirror of me. That day, I
discover I was not alone to have problems.#
#Wendy is a good girl, she had
certainly been very much in love
with that guy to be in such a shape.#
#How did she manage to go out
with a guy like this one ?#
#How is it possible, just aligning
sincere moments one after the other one,
to arrive in such a terrible position ?#
#Who could want that ?#
#I can't remember how, we finally
managed to begin to work.#
#After breakfast, we were
working hours with no break.#
#When we couldn't work anymore, we were
going to eat at the restaurant nearby.#
#We were going to bed late : even after work,
we couldn't really stop talking together...#
>Hello, Mr Rousseau ? Amy Shalerman speaking.
Yes, Hello, tell me, have you ever heard
about a Célia Shellburn ? >Yes, of course...
>Oh really ? Cause I heard
about her first time last week.
She's 24, and she's going to write her
memoirs, so she has many things to tell,
and you'll have many things to write !
#Very rapidly, I had to go back
to Paris : I had to begin the
other work with Célia Shellburn.#
>so, code is 46B28.
>I have red wine and diet Coke.
>I love that kind of...
>it was... funny...
>We can speak french if you
prefer : I speak french too...
>Oh, you (informal) speak... you (formal)
speak french too ?! Well, ok, no problem
>At 18, I had already gone all around
the world several times. >Waou, ok...
>It's really awful you know, to be very
well-known... >Yes, I can imagine it.
>Can we see "bateau-mouche" passing by
night ? Yes, it's wonderful, I do love it.
>Oh, I've always dreamt to see it !
>Célia, I've got to go !
I didn't see the time
#In morning, she was always taking
a rotten little croissant from the
Pakistanese grossery next door.#
#I tried to tell her several
times, but she insisted, giving
the pretext that she liked the...#
>"French breakfast".
#Me, on the other hand, as I do
everytime I go abroad, I insisted to
get used to country's traditions :#
#So, it was eggs and bacon !#
#At the begining, we just wanted to have a
little walk together, to show her Paris...#
#And time had gone forward and I felt
we didn't want to split. We wanted that
walk not to be just a little walk.#
#We wanted a longer walk.#
#At some moment, I don't really remember
why, nor how, but this happened...#
#I felt her hand saying me :#
>Really ? You think ? Are you sure ?
#And my hand answered :# >Yes,
I'm sure. I have desire, and I
can feel you have this desire too.
#I felt her hand holding me more
firmly, she felt desire too !#
#It's crazy to see how
these moment are strong :#
#A thing that lasts in a whole
12 seconds in your life and that
remains in your memory forever !#
#Habitually, a love story stops here
in movies : the best in a story,
it's not to tell the following.#
#But rightly : the most
interesting IS the following...#
>Leave me ! Leave me ! >I don't
want you to leave ! Stay here !
>Leave me ! Leave me !
>Stay ! Stay !... >No !!!
>Fuck ! Neus, what the hell
are you doing ? Neus ?!
>But Neus ! I can't believe it
! Neus, what are you doing ?!
#I have the feeling that with Neus, we
needed to live that kind of experience...#
#As if we wanted to prove ourselves that
if we were able to live crazy experiences
like that, it comforted us...#
#It proofed that we loved each other.#
>You know, it's kinda perturbing
to work with you... >Really ? Why ?
>Because one month ago, you were like
a stranger for me, and now, I tell you
my life, you're going to write it...
You're becoming something like my miror... and
I hope you don't think I'm too superficial...
>No, not at all ! You are a pampered
child, but you have a lot of personality.
>Really, do you think so ? >Yes,
and you are a beautiful person...
>You're going to reach your dream !
#Next morning, everything had changed :
even my scooter wasn't the really the same.#
#With Wendy, we've decided to leave :
we met her brother in Saint Petersburg.#
#Begining a story with a girl, it's like
going on a trip : it's by going far
together that we can know if we are closed.#
#Wiliam took us to his home. He was
leaving with his bride and his future
parents-in-law in a Communolka#
#A communautary flat they were
sharing with several families.#
>In Moscow ? You are in Moscow
? Well, I don't know...
No, I didn't say that ! It's true
it's not far... Yeah, why not !
Two days ? Ok...
Well, I don't know if I can... No,
yes, of course I want to but... Ok.
Yeah, great, i'll call you back.
#Any normal guy would have run
after her after hearing that.#
#I didn't move... Or actually, it's the
train that moved... and I let it go...#
>Oh, I'm so happy to see you !
I was alone in Moscow... and I became bored,
and I thought you were in Russia too, and I
thought : "That's stupid, we have to meet !"
I'm so glad you came ! You
really are a nice boyfriend !
#When I saw her I thought she was so
beautiful, and I thought "No doubt, Célia
is really a girl who makes people dream..."#
#She barely exists in reality
cause she's so beautiful.#
#It must be amazing to spend a
lifetime with a woman like her.#
#I can remember the sapoffer
was peacefully pestling bass...#
#After all, it's the job of
a bass box. It's to do that.#
#Must believe we like grave
: we all want to vibrate#
#Célia is the equivalent as woman
of the ideal dimensions street.#
#We don't have much time on earth, so
necesarily, at the begining, we have
the desire to live in that street.#
#I would have loved spending hours
just watching a girl like that one.#
#Just watching her living, watching
her walking, just being rocked by
the swaying of her skirt.#
#Just getting drunk at watching the
movement of tissue moving on her body.#
#I think that show would have been
enought for me for an entire life.#
#But is it possible to live like that ? #
#I felt I had to do what everybody was
asking me to do : I had to stop
dreaming... to come back to real life.#
>Hey, you bitch ! Your street, you
know what ? Your street is ugly.
>I left 3 messages to Wendy,
I don't understand...
>Why is she avoiding me that way ?
>Stop freaking out ! Anyway she'll
call you back at least, no doubt !
Right now, she's with her familly,
her brother's getting married,
it's normal, let her breath, too !
>Shit !!! 
>Yes mum >Do you know I repainted
the kitchen ? >Yes I know it, you
told me the day before yesterday !
Wait mum, I have another call.
I leave you, I'll call you back.
>What is the problem with love ?! How come
we're becoming crazy like that ? Can you
imagine the time we spend ruminating on it ?!
When you're alone, you complain
: "Will I find someone ?".
When you have someone : "Is she the good
one ? Do I really love her and does she
love me as much as I love her ?"
Is it possible to love several persons in
one's life ? Why do we split ? Can we fix
things when we feel we're loosing control ?
All these stupid questions
we keep asking ourselves !
Though, we can't say we're
inexperimented : we are prepared !
We read love stories, we read tales,
we read love novels, we watch love
movies... Love, love, love !!!
>What if you just called her back ?
#Though, it's crazy all that masquerade where
everybody plays : "It will be forever..."#
#We can't avoid being touched. We
can't avoid wanting to believe in it.#
#"Most beautiful day of my life, for
the best and for the worst aetcetera...#
#Ok, let's fill in the album, we'll
remember it our whole life, after
we'll have to remember this day...#
#It's like the gravestone of our
love which will live forever...#
#It's incredible : I can't
believe in it anymore myself.#
>Hey do I look like a girl who dances
farandole ? >Come on, we don't care ! >Sure...
>Is that ok ? >Yes
#So, This is me... I'll soon be 30, still
single...with my face of ME.with nothing
to do about it.I'm me,stupidly me...#
#No, that is too stupid, that's
not what had to be done.#
#I reconsidered all the girls with
who I had been, with who I had had
sex, or even that I had just desired.#
#I thought they were like russian dolls :
we spend our lifetime playing that game.#
#We are curious to know who will be the
last one, the very smaller which was
hidden since the beginning in all others.#
#We can't catch it directly :
we have to follow a progress#
#You have to open it, one after the other one,
wondering each time : "Is she the last one ?"#
#Shit, I didn't have time to finish.#
#Well, actually, it's not that bad if I didn't
finish telling my story : I'll finish later#
>Wait, I'm going to help you !
>Xavier ? I finished !
