So... Good evening.
Good evening. May I introduce myself?
My name is Këppl.
BEHAVIOR COACH AND MEMBER
OF THE KNIGGE SOCIETY
The problem is that wherever I go, nobody
greets me properly.
Unfortunately, you are not the only
not welcomed properly.
You arrive somewhere. And this...
Nobody does that.
It has completely disappeared.
Obviously, this is out of fashion.
I wonder:
Is there an equivalent?
There is nothing like the classic
handshake, shaking hands.
I understand that this is a problem,
because of... Well yes.
But they should do this...
A little higher.
It would be nice? If you do this...
- I understand exactly what you mean.
But that's neither fish nor fowl.
- That's true.
I spit on you.
You have to do like this.

That's no problem. You always have
a handkerchief in your pocket.
If you had it in your hand,
it would be called a towel.
The population
really surprised me.
I really did everything I could...
to, on this ground
desecrated by the enemy...
destroy the foundations of life.
In principle, the German people
should have ceased to exist.
But, I realize
now, it's still there.
I find it incomprehensible.
On the other hand...
I'm also here.
I understand that even less.
The enemy seems to have paused.
Above me there is no enemy aircraft seen.
I can not hear the thunder of artillery.
A bird moves,
through the branches of a tree.
He chirps. He sings.
I am in good physical condition.
I am healthy.
Apart from the headache.
Does Doenitz also lies here?
Who is this loser?
- All right, sir?
Oh, youth.
They are the future.
Young people seem muted.
That is understandable.
It is an unusual twist
in the life of an immature man...
Coming face to the Führer.
Where is Bormann?
- Who is it ?
Bormann, Martin.
- Never heard of.
What does it look like?
- As a government leader, good God.
Coming?
The shooting is not finished.
Yes, we are coming.
Hitler Youthful Ronaldo.
Where is the road?
Dude, what a moron.
That concludes Berlin-Mitte.
We go to Hellersdorf, where the
need probably is even higher.

I have to return to the Führer bunker.
Apparently the present youth cannot
help me with that.
BRANDENBURG GATE
The rubble is gone.
But people seem to have
gone completely crazy.
Have I missed the final victory
because I was in a coma?
I need more information about my situation.
How do I join the Chancellery?
Where is the Chancellery?
Nice to meet you.
To hell with Hitler!
What are you doing? What's this ?
- A picture.
Where is the Chancellery?
- Go away.
Tell me where it is.
The fate of the German people is at stake.
Are you crazy? I can not speak,
I mime.
Find your own place, man. Get out.
This is undeniable.
The situation here is out of control.
Finally, a familiar element!
A German mother with a stroller.
Madame. What date is it?
Talk!
What year is it?
One minute!
Hands off, you idiot.
PRIVATE ISSUER OF TELEVISION
Hello.
Someone is happy.
When I see you,
you always make me laugh.
From joy.
Not because of your look.
How am I?
- All black. It is a sad color.
And when we laugh, we...
God, a rat!
It's Jackie.
- You can not bring a rat to the office!
Only today.
He has to go to the vet.
It is sick?
- A common cold.
She is pregnant.
- What do you mean ?
His big belly there.
- Those are his nuts.
Rats have a bag full of nuts?
A TV channel is like a ship.
It can withstand storms...
if it has a good helmsman.
So far, Christoph Sensenbrink
was a good department head.
Now we need...
A long-term solution.
Ladies and gentlemen, my name...
Katja Bellini.
Super
- Good luck.
I wish you good luck.
And do not make mistakes.
Hopefully not. Thank you for
this opportunity and confidence.
I look forward to working with you all.
So I say, cast off,
and to work.
Mr. Kärrner,
you really believe...
Christoph,
you're still deputy director.

Deputy . Good.
Congratulations.
- Thanks, that's nice.
Mr. Sensenbrink wanted to talk to you.
Another dirty rat.
Sensenbrink, I mean.
Horrible.
When you type in the word asshole in
Wikipedia, what do you get?
You get the definition of the definition of an asshole.
And soon a picture of me.
Follow me.
You can not just fire me?
This is cost saving.
And freelancers are, alas, alas, alas
the first victims.
Sawatzki, look at it this way.
You wanted to become a great director.
Now you finally get the chance.
I have new material. A blast.
- A blast? Shoot!
Children ghettos.
Alcoholic father. Very sad.
But there remains a glimmer of hope.
And that hope is football.
You feel better?
What year is this?
2014. You expected what?
1945?
I have to...
Sit.
- It's a kidnapping?
Good one!
Is this a dirty trick by
an enemy secret service?
But they should create a new world...
In which I can move freely.
A parallel world.
No, that is unthinkable.
The enemy would send something better
than this stupid newspaper farmer.
I should kill him, to be sure.
- Eat a little, for the blood circulation.
Go.
Otherwise you will fail again.
Factory pressed grain.
There is always a shortage of bread?
Are you shooting somewhere around here?
Shooting?
Yes, for the television.
A documentary or something.
You always walk like this?
- Actually, yes.
It's surprisingly sweet.
It's crazy.
Your presence.
You could say you're him.
- I am who?
The Führer.
- I am the Führer.
Are you crazy?
Do you have the Volkischer Beobachter
or Stürmer?
Those are already long gone.
- Give me Panzerbär.
These are almost all Turkish.
- I have many Turkish customers.
The Turks in Berlin?
While the Ottoman Empire
changed the course of the war.
I never thought the Turks were
capable of that.
Our destiny is written?
Who determines our destiny?
I'd like to know too.
I never hoped that fate would
brought you here at my door.
What are you saying?
- Well, that fate...
That's it. Fate.
Fate.
Who else could bring fate back?
Fate so.
He told me to continue my fight.
My fate is not easy either.
- Silence!
The first step
is to obtain information.
And we find enough
in newsstands.
Obviously, people believe I'm dead.
And many enthusiasts have tried in vain...
to explain my achievements to the public.
The war is not won.
Russia shared the land
with the West, such as Poland.
The FRG is now led by an awkward woman...
With the appearance of a weeping willow.
She works with the Bavarian Christian drinkers...
To form a pitiful copy of
National Socialism.
When I see the SPD,
I get tears in my eyes.
Paul Lobe, Friedrich Ebert, Otto Wels.
The major villains!
They can take our lives, but not our honor.
Now the SPD is now led by a
damp rag and a fattened chicken.
Work for change.
- The only hope...
is this wacky Green Party.
The industrialization after the war...
has damaged the land, the air,
soil and man.
The Greens now want to
protect the German land.
Okay.
Reject nuclear energy after
few incidents was nonsense.
We need uranium for weapons.
Even Poland still exists.
And that in Germany.
This whole war was useless.
As far as I'm concerned,
you can stay a few nights here.
As long as if you do not steal my booth.
Listen, do I look like a criminal?
You look like Adolf Hitler.
- Exactly.
The hot spot of Berlin.
Here, young people have serious problems.
But there remains a glimmer of hope,
and that's football.
Fabian, I believe in you.
All thugs.
With a successful film, they would accept
me again immediately.
Who is it?
- It's me, mom.
No, in the background.
It looks like Hitler, right?
Right in Berlin.
That's a scoop.
What smell, good God.
Put the other displays outside.
Now I even have to work.
- You sit all day!
Yesterday I moved the 12th Army...
Now it is a newspaper stand!
Is that you that smells?
You should bring it
to the drycleaners.
EASY CLEANING Pinarbasi

Good day, see you next week.
- Thank you. Goodbye.
I'm listening.
- I want to clean my uniform.
Can I?
What a smell.
You take out everything?
- Yes all.
Everything must be clean.
No, not the pants.
Keep it.
But it is...
- No. Put it back.
It is dirty.
- What should I do?
Clean it.
- Sorry.
Coats and pants.
A man's pants.
And underpants.
- I do not do shorts.
Clean the drawers too,
please.
I can not walk like that in town.
So it will be pants, three euros...
Here's your ticket.
Tomorrow what time?
What time? Tomorrow?
What time? What time do you mean?
Ten, eleven...
- Early. When do you open?
Nine.
- Nine o'clock.
That early?
Please, a little later.
When?
- Twelve o'clock. Please.
I can not go out this way.
- I know.
Do you have another uniform for me?
Come.
- What is going on ?
Who is it?
- He looked for you everywhere.
From the TV.
A trade chain, right?
Sawatzki, Fabian.
- Hitler, Adolf.
From the German Reich.
He says you have a program?
Of course I have a program.
- Say it.
From 5:45pm we shoot back.
Something like that?
If you quote my speech
surely you know the rest.
There is something else?
- I listen.
From now on, it will be
a bomb for a bomb.
What do you know about Poland?
... Poland's capital is Warsaw.
It is in all encyclopedia.
Even a moth knows that.
But the true knowledge?
You have 1.4 million men.
And just 30 days for the victory.
- Why 30?
Where do you attack?
How will you remember the Romanians?
- Romanians?
Oh, sorry.
Who cares about the Romanians?
Geneneral Sawatzki looks neither left nor right,
 he walks straight ahead.
He walks straight ahead.
Poland is an easy enemy.
But what happens?
All of a sudden our army
has holes in the back.
And the blood of German heroes
flows through these holes.
Our general forgot the
alliance between Poland and Romania?
You'll never find the path of
Poland, with some army whatsoever!
You do not even find the way to your own
uniform.
On the contrary, I always know
where my uniform is.
At the drycleaners.
Sorry. You had me there.
You had prepared this, huh?
Off course.
Since June, it was all planned.
It's obvious. Fortunately,
I found you. This is my chance.
This is your chance.
You'll walk in contemporary Germany
I follow you with my camera.
I like that idea.
You will get your uniform
tomorrow, eh?
Course.
This is a flash cleaning.
Blitzkrieg.
Lord, I'm sorry.
It's very embarrassing.
I'm really sorry.
You were right.
It is really apart.
And it does not play a role.
He's just him.
Who are you talking about?
- Adolf Hitler.
Oh.
All I need is money.
I do not need a lot...
Just a little.
Mom, it's a good investment.
You need your car this week?
FLOWER DREAM
Is this the vehicle?
But this is not a good vehicle.
- I know, it's not...
It has no anti-mine armor.
- I have clothes.
I should condemn you to
the firing squad for this.
Why are you laughing?
You find it funny?
In such moments, I miss my SS.
Let's go.
You must still pay the newspaper
and chocolate. It's 26,40 euros.
26 euros? Lol.
You have done a great service to your country.
You can tell your grandchildren
about this achievement.
It is priceless. It fits you well.
How do you call yourself?
Adolf Hitler.
I have already told you !
Yes, really.
What a coincidence.
You have a real name?
I say 'What a coincidence'.
But you look really like him.
The mustache, the hair.
Your way of speaking.
Everything is the same.
And your look is totally different.
You are right again.
The Führer in northern Germany.
A Sylt,
swept by winds and waves.
Here it is, the Führer.
He looks at the sea. And
thinks maybe of England.
Those who are going through a creative crisis
do weird suggestions.
Sawatzki
wanted to film 'The Führer In The Bank...
Or 'The Führer To The Sea'.
Preferably jersey.
Goebbels would have turned in his grave.
A problem with the TV?
It's a TV?
What an advanced technology.
What a fantastic way for propaganda.
Why this cooking show?
There must be more interesting things
in the world than cooking?
Obviously not at this time.
Favorite dish Eileen:
red jelly and vanilla fruit.
What a delight...
- Delicious...

The pudding is...
- And with my best friend.
I had hoped for some sex,
but there was nothing.
I threatened my lawyer...
- What nonsense!
And this matron who grants
with a straight face.
Fortunately Goebbels
did not see that!
My wife greased you
the leg too.
You want to reap these
garbage with a gun DCA 8.8.
The theme that I was going to get in my
telefilms was needed.
Politics.
Are interviewed people across the country.
On current topics,
and sensitive subjects.
That's it.
I would say the big downside is wages.
You have the feeling of having voice
chapter in democracy?
No. I do not vote on principle.
I think that the elections are rigged
. Because nothing changes.
I come from the former East Germany.
We had an X
where needed.
Here is the same. Now the X
are placed elsewhere. Really.
Everyone is afraid to speak.
We can not say anything.
If it gets treated xenophobic.
Foreign children are a nuisance.
They throw stuff out the window.
When I interposed
parents threaten me.
Exactly. I'll address that.
Can I take a picture of you?
My name is Annett by the way.
- Adolf.
I knew.
The democracy had little effect on people.
But we can change that.
- How, for example?
The labor camps.
- Indeed.
I am well.
- Me too.
I say things as they are.
- Of course. I'll take care of the camps.
I will.
- I will help you.
We also have this problem in Germany.
What problem?
All these bearded suspects
should be thrown out.
No matter where.
With them?
- Some were born here.
You still have to return them.
- At their home ?
Where they want.
- Who are you thinking?
To these Salafists.
Yes, outside.
The suppressed anger and discontent of the population
remind me of 1930.
But at the time this term did not exist suitable
:
Disenchantment with politics...
Who knows humans, like animals.
- That's right.
What do you think of
the problems of Germany?
More and more migrants arrive.
You do not like me.
But we little people can do nothing
.
If many small people, men and women
cooperate...
To elect a big strong man?
So we can change things.
It's true.
The mixture of races is not good either.
Take the German shepherd.
A dog breed.
If the shepherd mates with
a dachshund, what do you get?
A shepherd-dachshund.
And what air he has?
- Comique.
Imagine two shepherds dachshunds
mate.
It will never give a shepherd.
And the shepherd will be gone.
Exact
- The race will disappear.
And this is what happens in Germany.
IQ people from Africa...
And I speak only of Africa,
arriving in Germany...
Ranges on average between 40 and 50.
Germany had more than 80.
IQ over 80?
- Sometimes higher. In Germany.
And it is how much now?
I think IQ is now about 60.
Up.
More migrants arrive...
More IQ will decrease?
- That is true.
Right.
- That's how it is.
I'll tell you one thing. If necessary,
I will take it to my country.
A few keywords as bait
sufficed.
And they bit the bait.
There was no Ebola before.
Now all these people landed,
and it was our first victim of Ebola.
Off course.
And this is due to what, according to you?
In fact we Germans
do not speak up.
Because the stigmas are still present.
I have to be honest with you,
I do not agree with that.
I am very determined.
I am not an extremist...
But I will always vote to right.
Politicians are lining their own pockets.
I'm surprised that the millions of people like you...
Do not go to parliament with pitchforks:
'What are you doing with my money?'
But the Germans are not
revolutionaries.
Would you follow me?
The timing is wrong.
I have to work.
Why the mustache?
- The war.
It had to fit into my gas mask.
How was it before?
A large mustache,
as were Wilhelm?
Far.
- Exactly.
You had one too?
- Yes, but I cut it.
For it to enter the mask.
- Good story.
We will give you a dog.
- Yes. Nice big shepherd.
Yes. Yes exactly.
Is there anything else he can do but run?
- He can sit, lie down...
I breed dogs especially for families.
My dogs are my children.
My problem child.
I found him...
It is cute, this little pooch.
Come to your uncle.
My little treasure.
Tonton has always loved dogs.
It's adorable.
Can we borrow a dog?
No. I do not know you.
I must be able to trust people.
They are very sensitive.
- We'll take good care of him.
The Führer loves animals.
He gets along well with them.
They come to him...
- Get off me, dirty mutt!
When you're on the road,
animals come to him...
Was it absolutely necessary?
Yes. It is the only language he understood
.
Give me that gun.
- No. It belongs to me.
You can not walk you
with that.
You may skid,
by doing so.
I keep it.
What is that noise?
What is it? This noise ?
This is hip hop.
Nigga, nigga. What does it talk about ?
It's a compliment, more or less.
A compliment?
Bullshit. Negro is an insult
for Black, even a child knows that.
You think I was born yesterday?
'Negro' means friend,
bro... Just nigga. Mate.
Ami? Nigga?
Hey, nigga.
How are you, nigga?
- Keep it. Stop.
What is it, nigga?
- No, stop it.
Pull yourself.
A real coward degenerate.
But wait.
I will make you a man.
It's only a dead dog.
Must send it by registered
... - Later. Not now.
Again this accursed fly.
Sawatzki, what do you want?
I turn a movie.
We will be a hit.
No, please.
Let me a chance.
You'll love it. Otherwise,
I never embêterai you.
Let me another chance.
- Fine, but this is the last.
Thank you.
It was a small problem.
It has almost no money.
I have to cover my costs...
The connection is bad.
You shake your phone.
And you stutter.
What have you done?
I wanted to swat a fly.
- This is the car of my mother.
Are you nuts?
There was no money.
What will we do?
- Quit your whining.
What became I'd
if I had not done policy?
Painter.
PORTRAITS DONATIONS WELCOME
Hello.
You want us to do your portrait?
What?
- A portrait.
On Hitler?
- No, you.
I'm done.
Is this a joke? A caricature ?
Absolutely you.
Do you like it?
- Yes.
I'm afraid I have to say no.
- How do you see yourself?
As a vagabond.
I have done my best.
This is what happens to stray.
And now the tears you pour.
Hang the picture to your wall, and you hang
next.
If in 2014 someone
arrived in the central square of Beirut...
And imitates Hitler,
and if the public tolerate this...
Then this is negative for Germany.
If it were up to me,
I would get fired.
How it, no money?
You are married, Sawatzki?
- No.
That's what I thought.
- What do you mean ?
To seduce women, it takes
courage. And you do not have one.
It does not seduce women
hesitantly.
Must gather all his strength, and then
: to attack.
You could write a book Hitler: Mein Kampf
With My Wife.
I like you, Sawatzki.
Come.
Touch closing.
You dare not? Come.
It's nothing.
I felt nothing.
It's wonderful.
You should have known me
in the 30s.
I thought, 'I know'.
We just say: It looks like...
- Hitler.
Exactly.
It's me.
- You like the CSU?
Anymore.
- Who do you prefer?
I would form a coalition with the Greens
.
It would be nice.
- The environment is like the motherland.
Protecting the environment is good,
and it is a Christian value.
Before, everything was not bad.
- No, we can not say that.
Politics has all screwed up.
- Do not whine about the past.
Si. We must learn from it.
It can never happen.
This time we will do good things.
This is a naive idea.
- Not at all.
We will do things well.
- No naive.
Will you support me?
- It is excluded.
I do not support you.
- You have a pen ?
I would note address.
For the first wave of arrests.
Then we'll see.
I'm not afraid at all.
Germany, I love you!
It stings.
It must undress?
- It burns...
SUPPORTERS OF BERLIN CM

Damn Germany.
All Nazi screwed.
You let say that?
Dirty traitor.
- Hang him.
Here's what happens to parasites.
Down Germany.
- Do not tolerate it. Catch it.
Take me a picture with Hitler.
- Yes, you and Hitler.
I love Hitler.
Can I hug you?
- Willingly.
Hitler ride.
A selfie with Hitler.
- He too watched 'The Fall'.
It has not aged.
- They are filming.
Sawatzki, you scare me.
Really.
It already has a million views for the video.
How?
- More than a million.
And I have other pictures.
- Not  question.
It is shameless. Challenging.
It's... Wham!
In full pear...
sorry.
What do you think?
Have you told anyone else?
Good.
Give me the number and images.
No need. He's there.
- Who ?

Sensen...
Brink. Hello.
Sawatzki, can you come?
This is not a circus. Again, since your
franc has not fallen:
Barre yourself crazy with this.
- Do not go there.
You can not...
Sensenbrink, one is desperate at this point?
- Not you.
I think you're right.
- About what?
The situation is desperate.
Sauvons Germany together.
Okay. Good idea. Come.
- One minute.
How do you save Germany?
You drink coffee?
Occasionally.
You there.
You drink coffee?
- Yes.
Where did it come from?
- Starbucks usual.
Who is responsible for that?
All these products preservatives?
Certainly not Mr. Starbuck.
It remains in the shadows.
No one wants to take responsibility.
For that we will have to change that.
A head, body and soul.
Germany must know:
Highway
was not designed by a moron!
No, it was the Führer.
When you eat bread, you know
it comes from the baker.
If you invade the rest of the Czech Republic
It was the Führer.
You have prepared this?
Why, Ms. Bellini?
My firm conviction allows me
to draw the right conclusions.
Epatant.
Find the right size for this man.
One more thing, sir...
- Hitler.
We agree that
the theme of the Jews is not funny?
You are absolutely right.
I have rarely met
women as formidable.
Riefenstahl was one.
Bellini is in the same mold.
With its strong body,
it stands straight.
She is alert, always ready
to react quickly and appropriately.
As a wolf ambush.
When it is stretched, it pulls harder
on its electronic cigarette.
But other than that, it has everything in hand.
An admirable woman.
It happened how?
- As expected.
How did it go?
- What?
Inside.
- Oh yes. Well, well, well.
So you return to me?
I bubbling with ideas.
I will contact you.
- Re-engage me.
If I go with Hitler.
Okay. I'll try to find you
a rewarding job.
This is temporary, said Sensenbrink.
Until a vacancy.
But this new actor
really stands apart.
I have trouble believing
it is not true.
I know.
And it is you who discovered?
You want a coffee with me
one of these four?
Sorry, but every time
I see...
You see what I mean?
- No.
But if you go out with me...
no worries.
You are friends of Franziska?
Obviously.
And you are Emo?
Or Gothic, or how do you say?
No, we Satanists.
Super
Here Fabian grandmother.
- I will not sign anything.
You do not have to.
Where are the tea bags?
What a lovely interior.
Delicious, this cake. You did it ?
Why do you take his head?
She suffers from dementia.
And you ask...
If she made a
cake with almonds and strawberries.
You're sadistic?
- No.
Your new kingdom....
You Can...
Here  Hitler, here Michael.
You allow ?
It works.
- What is it ?
Go laugh there.
- I can come back later?
We'll see.
I come for you later
for training.
I do not need training.
Call it focus.
- No need either.
If modern television...
- I would like a typewriter.
Krömeier. It will help you.
- I'm a pro.
Hello, sir.
- No sir. It's Mein Führer.
And greet me properly.
- I knew it. I can play a role.
Hello, Mein Führer.
- Lower hand.
Must shout it?
Or shout it differently?
Do me a favor,
and stop shouting.
He's right. Play the secretary,
and connect it to the world.
Then she showed me one of the most beautiful
inventions of mankind.
Computer. At the time,
it was not my thing.
For the troops, it was too big.
But then the computers are
become smaller and compact.
Then Douglas Engelbart arrived
and invented the mouse.
Don nose it to me.
With this, moving the cursor on the screen
. Try.
With the mouse?
- Double left click.
You do that very well,
for the first time.
What name will we use
for your emails?
Mine, of course.
These  your real name?
- No of course not.
I'm Shmuel Rosenzweig.
- Good. That's cool, Shmuel.
You write with 'ch'?
- I was joking, Miss Krômeier.
Adolf Hitler  already exists.
- Someone usurps my name!
Another name, then?
- A pseudonym, right?
Kind of.
- Well, use...
Use Wolf. Wolf... Wolfsschanze.
Wolfsschanze  6 is available.
- I'm not Wolfsschanze 6.
That was his name again?
Obersalzbach?
Obersalzberg. Berg.
Try  '
New Reich Chancellery'. I always liked it.
And she showed me something else.
A technological miracle: the Internet!
Type a word you want.
World Supremacy. Look.
All this concerns the world supremacy.
Great, huh?
The name Wikipedia already
illustrates the inventiveness of Arians.
Pedia as in encyclopedia...
Wiki and as in
thirst for exploration of the Vikings.
You cry, Mein Führer?
- No.
I'll cry too.
I know guys like
Sensenbrink.
Sensenbrink hope I have succeeded.
But it is only an accessory
success.
So he dreads the moment
where success eludes him...
And where it is not
an accessory thereof.
An insured fiasco.
Hitler in prime time?
The Jewish Council we will fall
on the back.
Bellini boot you train.
- Wait.
I'll put Hitler in the show 'Hi, old man! '.
The TV critics go
make trouble.
This thing with Hitler
will complete Katja Bellini!
Asylum seekers, gypsies,
minorities, I like it.
Jews, foreigners, homosexuals
and concentration camps.
Good themes. Even me
I can find a good idea.
I want you to find
gags. Witticisms.
Positive, with a touch of irony?
I do not understand.
Vouchers fun words.
- Racist jokes are racist.
It's great.
You like racism?
- If anyone can handle racism...
Is us.
You have to, if we want to be plausible.
That's better.
There are no taboos.
No limits.
And if you see a limit, go through it.
Salafis and Jews have much in common.
Circumcised, hooked nose
and flammable.
Were asked Jews
assess their trip...
Auschwitz. They all
awarded a star.
What does a Jewish pedophile?
... You want to buy this delicacy?
Sorry laughing.
A Salafist hears her child screaming.
'A real terror. '
The instructor asked me where was the
gas. "Second door on the right. '
Before  'dust you shall return'
meant holiday to Auschwitz.
That's what you want?
Exactly.
I go say hello.
Nice.
- Me too.
It looks great.
Christoph, you have a moment?
It's a great idea.
Hitler in the show.
We are not asking me anything?
I do not understand the concept of
my own show.
It's funny.
Hitler is still limited,
you know.
Yes, but your
issue is still limited.
There will be a show.
I have your word?
Two. You twice.
That's enough.
You can pick
drinks, Jeanette?
My name is Janine.
The show is live.
But fear not.
Be  yourself.
'Hi, old'
confirms all that I heard.
Witizigman played a lot of roles:
a black American president...
Or a Muslim, to make
short work of the current policy.
I am an erotic regime.
Fruit morning, noon, and evening
part of legs in the air.
The transition was made with a
Witzigman phrase uttered without flinching:
During decades,
it was gone. He is back.
Cheer loudly Adolf Hitler.
All or nothing. Forward.
Welcome, dear Adolf,
in 'Hi...
Old '.
Good day.
In this case I say:
cast off the bombs!
My character puts
evil spectators comfortable.
They compare my face with that
imitators of Hitler.
I see their trouble...
My simple look into a heavy silence.
It's part number?
- Not that long.
It's a blackout?
An assistant holds up a sign,
as if I had forgotten my text.
It was obvious that
face this apparent inactivity...
Witzigman this amateur would start to sweat.
What does that mean?
What is going on ?
It will do something?
- You must. It is live.
Take the relay, Michael.
- No, wait. Give him time.
Witzigman did not understand the power of silence. He was scared.
I let the air rush into my lungs...
And I gave her to silence.
There, I see someone
holding placards in hand.
With a text I have to read.
This text is a joke.
A joke about foreigners.
Why make jokes
on foreigners?
When you have rats at home, it is called
not a clown but an exterminator.
The TV in my hotel
thickness.
It is a
miracle of human genius.
But what we see on TV?
The trash TV shows.
When times are tough, people want
trivial entertainment, I understand.
That's why in 1944
light comedies were projected.
But is that times are so hard...
Bombarding people with such nonsense?
He's right.
- In what country do we live?
The youth poverty.
In older people.
Unemployment.
The birth rate lowest
history.
No wonder.
Who still wants to have children in this country?
We ruons us toward the abyss.
But we do not see, because
television...
You can not see the abyss.
We see a cooking show.
I will continue to fight against the TV...
Until not only the way we
abyss, but we should come to the end.
It is 20 h 45 and from
now are reruns.
It's getting late.
I forgot to call home.
You're married?
- No, I'm not my...
No, I live with my my my...
mè...
Ma... - What? Say again.
Flatmates.
In my mother, indeed.
- You want to sleep here?
On the couch.
But not touch
... - No, I would not touch you forever.
Who ever said?
Not so loud.
You'll wake grandmother.
A Margot too.
I do not want this asshole. You sleep ?
- That's enough.
I'll never forgive you.
OK, my friend...
That's enough. Thank you.
Shut up, Katja.
- Fichez peace with Hitler.
Stop this bullshit.
Hundred times we've seen your number.
Asshole! You are a real jerk!
Invite the Führer in all
emissions.
Breakfast, celebrities everywhere.
It is a hit. Great.
Thank you very much, and good luck.
Now is our next guest.
Is it wrong to say that
conquered Germany? This is how.
Cheer loudly Adolf Hitler.
You wanted to be a painter, it does not
market. It was a lack of talent?
No, providence wanted
someone like me to become a politician.
As these provocative rappers?
Yelling on a box?
But then?
- It is not provocative...
But the welfare of the people.
A Führer is nothing without them.
It's like Mozart without piano.
It can fiddle with his sister.
But taking him this violin?
What is your piano?
- The people.
I play the piano with the people.
- The black keys too?
The black also. When it is necessary.
But what are your future plans?
Making his greatness to Germany,
and ensure the survival of the people.
Do I go?
- To you, we have jobs.
Surely.
- Motorways, for example.
Yes, the toll booths.
- Or for road maintenance.
You must stay Hitler?
If I get anywhere.
You are never
someone else Hitler?
No, no. It never happens.
But you are never as someone
Thadeusz. This is your destiny.
And fate has chosen you...
- You are a small cog.
In the vast time machine.
- But you...
I am the great helm.
You are a small cog.
You spend
a jungle camp to another.
It's worse than the two world wars
I have experienced.
We ruons us toward the abyss.
But we do not see.
The 2nd World War, it was not that great.
Now we have a new actor...
And he imitated Hitler!
- Why do I have these glasses?
A famous rebel anyway, this guy....
- He said on TV that...
TV is trash.
So I wanted to see this.
Should we take it seriously,
or laugh?
But the themes are serious.
Rather reason...
The question is: Is Germany ready
?
There is a great debate on refugees.
So no, Witzigman,
it's not just the ratings.
It should not be underestimated.
In the past, there was much talk...
And it was put into practice.
I do not know if it was positive or negative
.
And you have that perfect look Hitler.
The sad
is that it is not wrong.
The youth poverty,
the old unemployment.
Chancellor or YouTube star?
It can be both.
A child in this country
what country we live?
If I want to bring a child into the world?
I found wonderful,
I will follow. Look at him.
Yesterday in 'Hi, old...
I hate you all except Hitler.
GOON TV-HITLER BECOMES THE YOUTUBE FÜHRER
Gold Brown.
The bittersweet seduction Adolf H.
Besides the Führer
pinpoints the problem. Everything is positive.
A real enthusiasm everywhere.
A real enthusiasm.
This is serious.
Stop that crap, dirty Jewish pig
I have not laughed so much in a while.
It was a bad sign.
That he took months before I knew
...
There are people who want to perpetuate
opens the National Socialist party.
Looking more closely, the NDP
opposed the death penalty...
Finally, for the
death penalty for pedophiles. For justice.
We are fighting only for our rights.
We need a little
democracy, yes.
For someone to impose the law,
and say
We will do like that, period.
You are absolutely right.
It is also my understanding of democracy.
How do you see Germany
in general? What would you change?
A huge issue for us
is the reform of federal finances.
And another issue is
education policy.
The government must have more responsibility.
Finally,
regarding me...
It does not look right...
The method steamroller
puts us right of center.
This is not good.
You cook for
National Socialism?
For Germany, actually.
It is primarily Germans,
and socialists.
Fate gave us
a surefire way of propaganda...
And preparing a stew beast!
This is madness.
These guys want to inherit the Nazi
? They are nothing!
Building the fourth Reich? They could not even ride a
IKEA furniture.
The political situation is good,
although it may seem doubtful.
Of course we can not be happy...
If 200 to 400 asylum seekers arrive in Munich every week.
Although agree.
More the worse, the better for us.
It's good politically.
- Listen.
I need people like you.
I want you to fight
in the next war.
All the front.
You would obey all my orders?
Cut that thing.
If you were him, yes.
When I think of Germany at night
I have insomnia
And that's the truth.
With his poem
I had tears in my eyes.
You have how many?
- Approximately 500
About 500? 2000?
They fourguent our ideas in the head
intellectuals.
No problem. But they will not act
only for just cause.
Course. The content is essential.
Most are willing to die for it.
- Naturally.
I want to die for my country.
- You see ? I need this.
I join you.
- Men like you.
I'm game.
- Stay strong.
Stay safe, Schnappi.
Strong as Krupp steel...
fast as a greyhound, tough as leather
!
For Germany.
- To Germany. And the cause.
Bye, nigga.
- How you, nigga?
Negroes.
That word is used today.
It is not niggaz.
OFFICE PARTY NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC
OF GERMANY
The Brown House in Munich
was nothing amazing.
But slums Kôpenich
was pitiful.
The building itself
looked so miserable.
What is it?
- Our nameplate.
Such a small plate is a sign of cowardice
. Step aside !
Stop.
It's our office. Hello...
Will you please...
You are allowed to film?
A national movement that is hiding behind the rules?
Where is your leader?
President, you mean?
Who should I tell?
- Hitler.
Quotation marks.
As if he had not accelerate.
That's Canal 7?
- This is for Germany.
FEDERAL PRESIDENT OF NDP

It's great. Herr Hitler.
Ulf Birne, president of
National Democratic Party.
Sit down. We must discuss.
Pleasure.
Do you represent the national cause?
One more
seen you in a while.
I have to manage my time.
But what did you do in the meantime?
Our comrades...
We share the trenches,
with peers.
It does not apply to
one here but me.
We, National Democrats...
- National Democrats, what does that mean?
What is the National Socialist policy
?
This requires a notion of democracy
for which there is no name.
It's silly. Have you read my book?
- It is hard to find here.
You regret having read it?
Or not having read it?
Or did not you understand?
You can turn off the camera?
No. You've wasted enough time.
Every word you annihilates
decades of progress.
And the races?
- Germany to All...
Who else? Poles?
This is the best element
you have?
Well, good luck.
Where is Mrs. Bellini office?
There, but first I have to tell you...
No, well we find. Thank you.
The cops and the prosecutor are there.
- Earlier than expected.
What can I do for you?
- The proc is there.
Göttlicher, prosecutor.
- Katja Bellini.
A complaint was filed
for inciting racial hatred.
Who filed the complaint?
It was anonymous.
- Oh, a traitor.
What does that mean for us
concretely?
Must stop emissions
with the Führer?
For now you can continue to disseminate
.
For my part I find sensational
show.
his  way to keep...
And this firmness.
The complaint was filed
surely by leftist.
Do not worry,
there will surely be a dismissal.
What should we do with the dog?
- The dog ?
I have to pay the bill.
- What dog?
The dog died during filming.
How do I recognize that?
Depreciation?
Or losses?
I'll do it.
Very kind.

It
- You ask me?
A huge pile of shit Nazi
that's what it is.
And everyone shouts' Hurrah! '
This is the most disgusting thing,
diabolical, inhuman...
You are drunk.
- You are sober.
You do all that clear mind.
You know how many people wear the
to the skies?
Not because they are funny or ironic
.
They find that this is right.
I ask you, Ms. Bellini,
it does you a problem?
They are written by idiots.
Who are afraid to miss the double meaning.
But there is none.
Hitler is simply junk.
A big pile of shit brown.
And you're on that pile of shit.
You are the boss.
- Enough!
You are not a deflated.
You are not remained,
like many others.
You're obsessed with your career.
Warning.
- It was painful. OK.
Goodbye, Mrs. Goebbels.
I have a confession to make.
We checked your background.
So the result had to reassure you.
On the one hand, yes.
We found nothing on you.
And the other side?
- We found nothing at all.
As if you had never existed.
And you want to know
if I really existed?
We must ensure that we do not work
with the real Hitler...
How do I say that?
- Indeed, it would be high treason.
So you have never been a member
a right party?
On the contrary. I helped start one. Member
555.
A youthful indiscretion, I hope.
- Bullshit. In 1919, I was 30.
It was not a youthful indiscretion.
- 1919?
When, if not?
I invented this trick myself.
The first 500
members were imaginary...
To think we had a lot of
members.
Thank you for that warm welcome.
I'm glad you're here.
And you're here.
How do I contact you?
- Herr Hitler, that's perfect.
You can also say Mein Führer.
- You're an actor, right?
Some see me as well.
- You feel good in this role?
I feel good in all roles.
I want to touch people.
For this they have to listen.
That's why I play the fool.
- What kind of man are you?
Many newspapers say I'm crazy. What do you think ?
I look like a fool?
- A little yes.
Your eyes make me scared.
- I can not do otherwise.
I am what I am.
- You think this is funny?
Also  comic that our time.
- What you are doing is justified?
Look what we found in
the clips you've shot.
What? What music?
- Look.
I must be able to trust people.
- You can not.
You have no right.
- What is it ?
Sale mutt.
- My dog...
You think this is funny?
We're supposed to laugh at that?
It was an accident.
It was not so bad.
Yes, it was serious. Where did they get that?
- At your house ?
This is your kind of humor?
Why did you make this video?
I shot this
dog because the dog had sought.
It had bitten my finger.
What I did, I would do it with you.
I garerai tanks in front of your studio.
I refuse to be transferred
because of a dog.
HITLER OF LICENSED TV

Tragic. You have done your best.
- No false pity.
It thinks.
Everything is possible on TV.
The viewer forgive almost anything.
But kill a little dog?
The German soul will not forgive you.
My wife and I have been sick.
I wish you the best.
You are in command now.
Do not disappoint me.
Certainly not.
Hello. The string
more we pay the hotel, can we sleep here?
Please.
Thank you, Madam.
Your help will come...
Coming?
- in history.
The path taken by fate to
reach its destination is amazing.
It promotes moments of crisis...
And gives me the courage to write a second book.
What are you doing?
- I am writing a new book.
And?
- Completely crazy.
It describes how he wakes up in the modern Berlin
. It also intervenes.
I see the film here.
I have a condition.
I want to film adaptation of the book.
The success was instant.

NO HITLER  =  NOT HEARING

HE IS BACK '
I respect the way Hitler
adapts to the new world.
I
kill anyone if it is not absolutely necessary.

Do not be afraid.
I am a nice guy.
The call on Facebook for
bodyguards was promising.
But the first
materia left much to be desired.
My God.
And yet
30. Until you stop laughing.
It amuses you?
Go, enjoy it.
You find it funny?
You are laughing less now.
Louder.
3  MONTHS LATER
Our viewership numbers are small.
Revenues from advertising are almost nil...
The emission of Witzigman
deliver us afloat.
Now we will broadcast
'Hi, old' five times a week.
Witzigman passes Sat1.
'Hi, old' no longer exists.
You stay here Rugemon...
Lummlich...
Mancello.
And Nils.
What do you think?
'Hi, old' no longer exists?
It was my show.
You're as pathetic incompetent
!
How do I run a TV channel
if you sabotage me all?
Outdoors.
Outside brief glow.
One might recall Hitler?
People do not want him
very long.
Even if they hate,
they buy his new book.
To read his latest escapades.
- You can not do that.
The book is selling like hotcakes.
They are working on a movie adaptation.
We should take part.
You have always been against Hitler.
- Of course.
But I was not in charge.
CCC STUDIOS CINEMA BERLIN

This looks great.
This will be projected on the big screen?
Who are you, anyway?
Cut. Stop.
- Who has just come on the set?
I thought you...
Mad, eh? A silicone mask.
It's really Sensenbrink?
- It's him.
I wanted to go.
I always believed in you.
The time is right.
You want one? Refined, eh,
with the mustache as a title?
Awesome.
And the funny thing: its price is 19.33.
As the year 1933.
- I understood.
Sensenbrink Christoph, Christoph Sensenbrink
here.
I am waiting for this moment for so long
.
I dream like you now.
- He plays my role?
But nobody knows.
Why not Benno Fürmann, or Bruno Ganz...
For such a small role?
That would be silly.
You already have a string?
- We are currently negotiating.
Pro7, RTL, ZDF, etc.
I know.
From the talk, but few concrete.
You need a strong partner.
It will inject one million for the budget,
and distribute your film. Everyone wins.
I'll be right back, Grandma.
We finally succeeded.
- Do not look disorder.
Will you take off your coat?
You're welcome.
Sorry to land and home.
- It's impossible.
It's an honor. Your granddaughter
is an admirable woman.
This is Hitler.
Do something !
It's not true.
She thinks so.
Think of your family.
All these people. Dead.
Do something.
This time also makes me angry.
I will ensure that no
English bomber...
Who is talking about bombs?
None of them died under the bombs
. You've gassed.
It's funny. Satirical.
- It looks the same.
It is the same speech.
At the time, people also have
laughed at him, at first.
I know who you are.
We have not forgotten.
Mrs.
... - Outside.
Outside assassin.
Ugly. Awful...
Ms. Krômeier is Jewish.
I'm surprised.
It's not that.
- You are disappointed.
I should have been harder on this
old Jewish harpy. I understand.
But as a politician
must set priorities.
As the Olympic Games in 1936. No
persecution of Jews during 3 weeks.
You can not once
forget the role?
Like Ms. Krômeier.
I understand.
It is not perhaps not much
Jewish blood.
The body can absorb some
Jewry.
My God, what kind
man are you?
Now the three boys
to arrive.
Yes, but what happened before?
How did you get here?
What happened before?
- I do not know.
What? You have been teleported,
or what?
What do you think, Fabian?
You did not ask
where he came from?
A time travel?
Where he escaped from an asylum?
Let me pass.
- No.
Stand back.
You do not recognize me ?
How?
Because of that mustache?
You stab Germany in the back.
You are a pig.
A pig who does not deserve to live.
You gave us a fright.
Mrs. Bellini.
What is it?
- It's all for you.
Look, Boris Becker. They all want you
good recovery.
Why?
- Why ?
You were beaten up by neo-Nazis.
You are a hero of democracy.
It's Sigmar Gabriel said.
He admires you.
Everything okay?
- I could not help laughing.
These amateurs.
Yes, there are enough.
It starts to rain.
Should finish shooting!
It is lying there.
BUNKER FOR AUTOMOBILE
LOCATION HISTORY OF 'THE BUNKER FÜHRER'
Where is he?
- What are you doing here ? You must shoot.
It is real.
I do not know how this is possible...
Yes, it is very authentic.
But we already knew.
You do not get it. It is Adolf Hitler,
not a comedian.
Why do not you listen?
It was Hitler.
I do not understand you.
- It does what it has always done.
How can I be more clear?
It must be stopped. Do something.
My God, we have...
- Take a deep breath, okay?
There is no time to lose.
I do not want any trouble...
- Good. We neither.
Stop It.
That's fine.
You are good Germans. Thank you.
I wondered where you stay.
- You're it. You are it.
I have never claimed otherwise.
I am destined to have to separate myself
of my dearest companions.
This way!
Yes, history repeats itself.
You are trying again to fool
people with propaganda.
You do not understand.
In 1933 the people have no
been deceived by propaganda.
A Führer was elected
and outlined his plans with clarity.
The Germans elected me.
Move.
You are a monster.
- Really ?
So you must also condemn
those who elected this monster.
They were all monsters?
They were ordinary people.
They entrusted their
countries an extraordinary man.
What do you do?
Prohibit elections?
No. But I'll neutralize you.
You are never asked
why people follow me?
For the bottom of themselves,
they are like me.
They have the same values.
And that's why you
are not going to shoot.
You can not get rid of me.
I am part of you.
From all of you.
And not everything was negative.
And it is in the box!
Silence. The boss wants to speak.
It's great that everyone
make the party.
But we must also think of our companions...
That are no longer present.
A comedy about Hitler,
will it work?
There were German comedies
before and after Hitler.
It has given a new dimension to entertainment
.
Even Loriot was unsuccessful.
If the real Hitler back?
History will repeat itself?
For 70 years,
is fixated on it.
Students are tired of hearing
talk about that.
It takes a little more confidence.
Thank you.
It's back
it's back
He's back I was told
But it is not with me
I do not understand
I wonder:
that has happened?
It's back, but not with me
And it does not sound at my door
All the people in town
Have preview
It's back
that has happened?
In our letters, we spoke
Than happiness
And how it would be for both of us
But one more day no letter is arriving
It's over? It's finish ?
I have nothing against the Turks
or the Syrians. The problem is that...
Everything has a deeper meaning.
The location is excellent for me
Germany, Europe,
worldwide.
The Austrian government is a puppet.
Those who travel to Sweden
must adapt.
Riots in front of a center for refugees.
A building is on fire.
It's going to change our country.
It is the specter of Islam.
They come from Tunisia and Morocco,
where the Germans go on vacation.
It is the people
I can live with it.
It is the people!
