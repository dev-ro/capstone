History has proved us right,
and you know it.
It's never proved anyone right.
History's a...
...deaf man answering
questions no-one's asked.
Parole, parole, parole.
History never lies, Lola, and...
...you trust someone
who can't...
-...help you.
-Who do you mean?
Remember: God wishes all ills
to cease, but he can't do it...
...which means
he's weak, or else...
...he can do it, but doesn't...
...which means he's evil,
or he doesn't...
...or can't, so he's weak and
evil and therefore is not God.
Unde malum? I know Epicurus,
his ideas are...
...interesting,
but no good to me.
A trilemma always leads to
intellectual paralysis...
...he can't be weak or strong,
or good or bad.
He can't be anything.
-I don't understand you.
-I assume you know your bible.
-Lola, I'm a professional.
-Right, then. Exodus 3.1 4.
''And God said
unto Moses: I AM...
...THAT I AM.
Thus shalt thou say unto
the children of Israel...
...I AM hath sent thee
unto you.''
No, it was:
''EHYE ASHER EHYE.
I WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE.''
He spoke in future
not in present, God is...
-...to come. It's my only hope.
-Come on, that...
...might get your intellectual
friends into bed, but it's...
...simpler than that, you're all
like the olive in the dry...
-...Martini.
-Necessary but not unessential?
-Right.
-Where are you going?
-We have an appointment.
-OK.
I'm afraid you've lost
the battle.
-Perhaps.
-In any case, Lola...
...why go on fighting?
-I do have my principles.
-I was afraid of that.

HEAVEN,

HEAVEN'S MATTERS
Things are not good...
...I don't want to lie to you.
In the last years the number
of incorporations for...
...merits has been low,
and I don't think it'll change.
If it continues like this,
we won't keep going long...
...we must accept
the rebels' victory.
No, I haven't. With the time...
...you've been here,
you should know nobody has.
Sorry, I'm a little nervous.
I've tried to, I swear,
nobody knows where he is.
They say he's tired, depress...
...almost defeated.
But we must not be afraid,
they are just rumors.
We must solve this problem.
I have good news.
We have a request.
-From who?
-From a mother.
What a success, Lola,
they've been crazy.
Silence.
No more applauses.
Listen.
They stop clapping.
Lola, they've been
clapping for 10 minutes.
-What else do you want?
-They weren't 10 minutes.
Good evening, Lola.
-Sorry for the interruption.
-I didn't know...
...you were here,
you should have told me.
-I would have sent...
-I arrived at the end.
But the last song is fantastic,
it's so romantic.
-Do you like it?
-Yes.
It's the first time I sing it.
Tell me, don't you think
they stopped clapping too soon?
No, people loved it,
they love you.
I don't know. The first day...
...of a tour is always
the most difficult one.
Lola, I'm afraid you
have to cancel...
-...your next presentations.
-Why?
A lady asked us to save
the soul of his son.
ENTER TO HELL,

JACK DAVENPORT
HELL ADVISOR
Yes?
Hi.
-Did you win?
-No.
Since you left,
I haven't won anything.
Many, I've come back,
but if you lay a finger...
Many...!
Many, Many, Many!
I'm glad you're back, Lola.
CIRCLE 33, HELL
Well, having done our duty
to our grandparents...
...it's back to
the 21 st century.
Aren't you hungry?
I went to the doctor's.
He told me not to box again.
Wait, I'll get it.
Dear nephew, I need to ask you
a favor. I know we haven't...
...met in a long time.
Your cousin, Carmen.
Don't say you don't
remember me!
I'm your cousin, Carmen.
You've changed, haven't you?
-How about a kiss?
-Sure.
Let me give you a hand.
Come on in.
My cousin Carmen.
She'll stay for a few days.
Easy... I didn't mean
to frighten you.
Incredible
how you've changed.
Who'd have thought
it was same person...
...as in this photo?
It isn't the same person.
That was fifteen years ago.
Many used to show me how
to box, didn't you, cousin?
Many!
Elbows tucked
in at the sides.
Did you forget what
I taught you?
Stop fooling around!
The doctor told me
not to box again.
There's something wrong
with my head.
Christ, Many, I'm so sorry!
I really wanted to see you
box again.
Fucking hell!
Where shall I put it?
-In the album.
-Where is it?
On the sideboard.
Put it in the green one.
There's room at the front.
You won't last five minutes.
Elbows tucked in at the
sides, don't forget.
In case you hear
your responsibles to say...
...I'm absent for
illness or tireness...
...use this key
and follow my instructions.
Jack Davenport.
How's my mother?
The last time I saw her,
she was fine.
She has trouble getting about,
but she's as chirpy as ever.
I haven't seen her in 7 years.
I know...
Does she mention me?
No, actually she doesn't
mention you.
After you left,
she never did it again.
Never?
Never.
What's the matter?
Lola, if you've done something
bad to somebody you...
...really Ioved, how would you
get her to forgive you?
-By talking to her.
-I can't. She doesn't live here.
You could write a letter.
I've never written one.
Then do something to make
her feel proud of you.
Something to show you've
changed.
Then she'd forgive you.
How would she find out?
Sooner or later she'd find out,
don't you worry.
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.
And what could I do?
1 ,400.
Thanks.
Always the same. Because of
her, we'll be out 10 min. Late.
Hello. This is our new floor
supervisor, Carmen Ramos.
She'll be in charge
of cashing up.
Christ, she looks
like a model!
Just a minute, will
this count as overtime?
I wish it could, Antonia,
but the wage agreement...
...doesn't count inspections
as overtime.
The sooner we start,
the sooner we'll finish.
So let's go.
She's too attractive, Eduardo,
too attractive.
I know, but her references
were excellent.
And she's the only one who'd
take half the normal salary.
Don't you think her skirt's
too short?
Perhaps.
But neither you nor
I are her husband.
We're just her bosses.
It's my first day and I won't
bore you with speeches.
I know you're tired and
want to go home.
But before you go, I'd like
you to share a thought with me.
If our workmate Lola can
ring up almost twice as much...
...as anyone else,
then something's wrong.
We have no alternative but
to try and find out what it is.
Well, girls, I won't keep you.
Good night and see
you all tomorrow.
-Good night.
-Well done, Lola.
Got to keep up
with things, Lola.
Fucking hell...
Sorry, ma'am.
I saw it in a newspaper and
thought you might like it.
Go on, help Lola
lay the table.
I don't like to see women
doing nothing.
Into the kitchen with you.
I'm going...
What's this?
Tijuana, I KO'ed him in
the fifth.
Many...
that's all over now, okay?
You have to think of
the future.
Sure, but the future's
not what it was any more.
These people want
to talk to you.
Sorry to bother you
but it's urgent.
If you've come to offer him
a match...
It's nothing to do with boxing.
Would you like a drink?
Thanks, but we had
coffee downstairs.
I can't pay you now. You'll have
to wait until tomorrow.
I'll call the police.
Don't bother.
Does it turn you on?
-What's the matter?
-Easy...
-Many!
-Let's go.
Many!
Many, Many, Many!
Many!
-You bitch!
-I can manage...
I can manage...
Your husband owes me over
5 million pesetas...
...without the interest.
I didn't know... I haven't got
that much money.
Mortgage your house.
It's rented.
Then ask for a loan
on your salary.
All right, I'll do that.
I'll ask for a loan...
I'll give you 15 days.
Banks are so slow.
I'm only doing this for you.
I'd given up on Many.
I'm disappointed on him.
He might have done well
as a boxer if he hadn't...
Daddy, daddy, look!
It's their first communion
next month.
Go and change. You might
spoil those dresses.
My lovely girls!
Fifteen days. Okay?
Everything okay?
Yes, it's all sorted out.
I'll ask the bank for
a loan to pay off your debt.
See how those kids put
their heart into it?
Maybe some will
get to the top.
How come you
owe that money?
They gave me some stolen
jewellery to sell off...
-And?
-Well, I sold it...
...but went and spent
the money.
What did you spend
5 million on?
-On things.
-What things?
If you hadn't gone,
I wouldn't...
You've got to change,
you know. And a lot.
-Let's go.
-No, wait.
It's nice here.
I've got you a job at the...
...supermarket as a
security guard.
-Will I have to wear a uniform?
-Of course.
Fuck...
Why don't you tell your cousin
to go somewhere else?
No, I can't do that.
She's my cousin and
I'm her godfather too.
-Is she really your cousin?
-Who else she might be?
Oh, sorry, I didn't
see you come in.
Lola wanted me to put the bag
away, carry on if you want...
No, I was just playing around.
It's not the end of the world.
You knew you'd have
to give it up.
Start thinking of you
and Lola.
She's so happy about it.
It's like a liberation for her.
Many... it's okay,
for Christ's sake.
But it's a pity you couldn't
try for the championship.
But such is life...
Yeah, such is life...
I'm the greatest, I'm
the greatest, I'm the champ.
I'm the champ,
I'm the greatest.
I'm the champ, I'm the champ.
Leave him alone.
-He's a poor wretch.
-Not that wretched.
Some have been damned for
a lot less.
But he's going to change.
I doubt it.
He won't have time anyway.
Either those cops
or boxing will kill him.
I don't know why you bother.
I pity you.
You remind me of my father.
That's nice. He must have been
a nice person.
Very, but it didn't do him
any good.
And talking of nice people,
can I give you some advice?
Of course.
For a woman, being nice
isn't very useful.
Between you and me, it just
isn't sexy.
Sure, but it's very chic.
There are very few left.
Lola!
Keep trying, you might
convince me.
I always liked boxers.
Not in my in-laws' village...
Why did you agree?
Because my mother-in-law
went on and on.
I'd have said no to mine,
I know how to handle her.
Is there something wrong?
We're not used to eating
with bosses.
-No, don't go.
-I'm just...
...other worker like you, girls.
-Has anyone seen Lola?
-She's not in yet.
She's on the afternoon shift.
Oh yes, she told me so
at home.
She's my cousin, you see.
Actually, my cousin's
wife.
But I'm staying with them.
She didn't tell us.
She keeps to herseIf.
She didn't tell me she'd been
at university for a year either.
-She's Iever...
-If she's so...
...clever what's
she doing here?
She doesn't want her husband
to feel small.
That's pretty stupid, isn't it?
She always
made me suspicious.
It's romantic. Carmen...
I can call you Carmen,
can't I...?
-Sure.
-I'm pregnant.
Will they fire me?
They can try over
my dead body.
I'm a woman too, you know.
Hello...
Lola, before I forget,
I spoke...
...to the manager and he says
Many can start right away.
Her husband's going to be
a security guard.
What's on the agenda today?
First, the check-out girl
who's pregnant.
Make sure the special offers
are in a prominent position.
When her attendance
gets bad, fire her.
Another reason.
We don't fire pregnant women.
I want a constant
watch kept here...
...to stop them eating
the yogurts, they don't...
...even finish them.
Anything else?
The check-out girls want you
to see their union rep.
-What do they want?
-A pay rise.
-That's not possible. Next item.
-Sorry, but...
...they hinted at action if
their claims weren't considered.
There are plenty of other
people out there.
No mass dismissals.
The shareholders are...
...good Christians and don't
like adverse publicity.
We must fire the rep,
it'd frighten the rest.
But remember what happened
in Barcelona when we fired...
...the packers' rep.
They went on strike and...
...we lost a month's sales.
No, no, women always stick
together...
Well then,
we can only negotiate.
Negotiate? Negotiate what?
There's nothing to negotiate.
We have to find a solution.
Sir, I think I have a solution.
Have you? What is it?
''Egonomics.'' The economic
analysis of emotions...
I'm writing to my mother.
The other idea was too
complicated.
Come on, hurry up.
-Lola?
-What?
Where did we meet?
In Bilbao, after a fight.
And when did we
get married?
Five years ago.
That's not right...
Many, we got married
on May 9, 1997.
-So 97, 98, 99...
-If you say so.
The thing is, it feels like
we've only been married a week.
Many, no. Stop it. Do you want
to be late on your first day?
Lola...
Shit!
Hey, Many.
This is worse than boxing,
right?
Forget the other night.
Come on, I was only
obeying orders.
That girl... who is she?
-My cousin.
-Christ!
She's a real cutie.
Do you mind if I shag her?
I'm only joking.
She doesn't like guys.
So keep an eye on your wife.
Ignore him, he studied
psychology once.
Take care.
Remind your wife
about the money.
And watch her,
my partner might be right.
May I stay up
and watch TV?
They're showing a good film.
I was murdered the day before
the première, so I didn't see it.
Do what you want but next
time knock first.
Good will is what we should
show to solve the problem.
I've read their letter and
a pay rise is only an excuse.
What they really
want is attention.
We need them to feel part
of our project.
Sometimes we forget that
a little affection...
...human warmth, is worthier
than any pay rise.
So I've made a decision.
Fire the rep and
get round them.
Tell them we need them.
That they're as important
as you or me.
Good will.
A great idea.
It may be true that good will
moves mountains, but...
But what?
Do you know the story
of the Good Samaritan?
It's one of my favourites.
Then you'd agree with
Mrs. Thatcher that...
...no-one would remember
him today if all he'd...
...had was good will.
Because he also had money.
-What do you mean?
-Tha same...
...as the Good Samaritan.
I want to combine money
and good will.
Do you mean give them
their pay rise?
Not all of them.
Actually just one...
The union rep.
And I think we should
make her supervisor.
No, no. I'll never do that.
She's a revolutionary.
She should be fired,
not rewarded.
Firing her would be
a mistake.
And all revolutionaries
are conservatives at heart.
Once established, they run out
of steam.
Well, you may be right...
But who shall I fire?
We have to fire someone
to serve as an example.
No problem. Fire this one.
But this is our
best empIoyee.
Exactly.
The kid at the top of the class
is never popular. Fire her.
No-one will stand up for her.
It won't cause any problems.
All right. I'll think about
what you've said...
...and let you know
my decision.
Good.
This dish will eat up all of us.
Why?
She'll cause a lot of trouble.
She's full of venom.
-Do you think so?
-Yes, I really do.
That's a pity.
But her idea's brilliant,
isn't it?
Yes, but here, all the good
ideas should come from you.
Can someone pass me
a band, please?
What's the matter?
They're going to fire people...
Why?
The letter we sent.
Please, stop talking about
politics all day.
They can't fire people
for that.
And if it's only rumors...
Don't you believe it, then?
They won't fire you,
so why should you care?
I signed it too.
Stop pretending, Lola.
We all know you're the
personnel officer's cousin...
...and she lives with you.
Our husbands are out of
work too, you know.
Antonia Jimenez,
to personnel, please.
So we shouldn't listen to
rumors?
''Mother, I'm living in Madrid.
I'm married now.
My wife's called Lola
and she's very clever.
She's been to college.
Cousin Carmen is staying
with us.
I fought in the Spanish
championship in 1999.
I now work in a supermarket.
Your loving son, Many.''
What do you think?
Fine, but you didn't say sorry.
You're right.
That's it.
Many, why's your mother
mad at you?
-Something I did...
-Tell me about it.
What for? It's not important.
It happened a long time ago.
That doesn't matter.
Tell me...
I took money she'd saved
for my brother's education.
I wanted to be a boxer,
but she wanted me to work...
I needed the money
to get on...
Go and post it then.
Hi, Lola, is Carmen here?
We're going... dancing.
Yes, she's in her room.
Gee, you look nice.
Do you think I look nice?
Yes, if you like it.
Don't wait for me.
See you.
Sorry, but I needed
to see you...
...downhere, I was drowning.
Don't worry,
why is it so urgent?
I want you to replace me.
Why? You're doing it all right.
No, I'm not doing it right,
I lost interest and...
It's about her, right?
I feel strange things.
I'm very confused.
You must replace me,
you must...
...send another agent
or we will lose Many.
I can't. The truth is...
...there's nobody else.
I can't replace you.
The old ones don't know
what to do down there.
-And the new ones?
-They don't work.
Most of them are here because
of objective conditions...
...not for their own merits.
They don't integrate,
they just watch TV...
...and eat hamburguers.
They are a disaster.
Are we so bad?
Worse than that.
Look.
And my audience?
There's no other choice, Lola.
Keeping this is
very expensive.
And to tell you the truth,
it's not easy.
If we don't have a radical
change, we won't...
...resist more than a year.
You must get Many to
come with us at any price.
But Many is just one soul.
I don't know how...
Do you know the story
of Cleopatra's nose?
Yes, sure, if her nose...
...had been 2 cms longer,
the history...
...of Earth would have
been different.
If Many's soul is in our side...
...even though it seems
insignificant...
...maybe we could save us.
And don't ask me why,
I won't know what to say.
Trust me.
If you want Many,
we must change the rules...
...if not, it can't be done.
Sorry for the interruption.
We would be really happy
if you sing something.
We miss you very much.
Please?
Well, what can I do.
Artists.
-What are you looking at?
-Me?
Mother...
...I work at a supermarket.
Your son, Many.
Plese, forgive me.
Please, forgive me.
Shit.
Shit.
Yes?
Did you post the letter?
Let's go to bed.
Many, did you post
the letter or not?
-No.
-Why not?
Because of
things on my mind, you know.
Are you coming to bed or not?
No. Just tell me why
you didn't post it.
I suddenly remembered
how my mother always...
...loved my brother
more than me.
OK?
If you don't come,
I'll put the bag away.
Sorry, sir, I didn't hear you.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
I had to be sure it was you.
We have to be careful!
Of course.
What's the matter?
Problems, problems...
Now this is...
...strictly confidential, OK?
Between you and me.
There's a plot hatching
in hell to replace me.
-Who are the traitors?
-Some of the Council members.
They say I'm old-fashioned.
They want a new
management model and...
...change the rules
to suit them.
-That'd be terrible!
-I know. That's why...
-...I need your help.
-I'll do whatever you ask.
-I've always hated traitors.
-I know. That's why I chose you.
The bastard!
Look, I need to speak to...
...our cousins.
Tell your agent I need
to speak to... Marina D'Angelo.
She'll understand.
And about the boxer...
...forget his soul and
concentrate on his body...
...just his body.
Do whatever you need just...
...to make sure he doesn't
have any accidents. Okay?
-Yes, but...
-If he died...
...it'd be catastrophic.
-Understood?
-Yes, Sir.
If everything turns right, I'll
take you to circle number 10.
-Oh, Sir.
-Yes, but...
...take real care of
the boxer, it's very important.
Can I ask you a question, sir?
-Yes.
-Why is the boxer...
...so important?
He's just a normal sinner.
I know, but sometimes,
apparently unimportant things...
...can bring about drastic
changes. Did you...
...read Pascal at school?
-Yes, yes...
-And his speculation...
...on Cleopatra's nose
and all that?
-Yes...
-You did? Well...
-Goodbye, sir.
-See you.
Goodbye, sir...
Excuse me.
I'd like to talk to you.
And I'd like to talk to you.
I was wrong about
who to fire.
Maybe so,
but it's too late now.
Lola, I have to talk to you.
Well? Have you got
it off your chest?
Can we talk now?
Let's try and act
like professionals.
-I was only obeying orders.
-That's what they all say.
You really are like my dad.
Don't be so prudish.
A rebellion's broken
out in Hell, to stop it...
...we need to save Many's soul.
My boss wants...
...to talk to one of your
people... Marina D'AngeIo.
And why aren't you
on the rebels' side?
I never liked being used.
By those in power? I know
the story, I'm not that old.
Sure.
How do I know
you aren't using me?
-You have my word.
-That's not enough.
Then you'll have to risk.
We need your help
and you need ours.
But, Jack, it's you who's
got a revolt on his hands.
But if they win, you disappear
and that'd be a disaster.
-Come on.
-I don't understand...
...why our survival
interests you so much.
A question of balance.
Once the hawks kill the doves...
...they'll start killing
each other for lack of food.
But there's something else,
isn't there, Jack?
Yes, they want
to change the rules.
I don't understand.
Besides
the fact that they...
...want to get rid of me,
they have a plan.
So far, Hell's been a fair
place.
Yes, Sir.
When the judges send a new
inmate...
...we don't care if he was
a pope, a king...
...a cleaner or a banker.
They all do their time.
But if they win, everything'll
change, a rebellion of...
...the rich is the most
dangerous of all.
How will the inmates
tolerate such thing?
Those bastards have got ready
for years. They've created a...
...worId of moral puppets
conditioned by TV, a kind of...
-...evil Disneyland where men...
-And women, Jack, women.
Sure... where men and women,
of course, where...
...they feel no guilt for their
actions, no responsibility...
...for what they do.
And I will not tolerate it!
Centuries ago I rebelled
against another...
...tyrant and I don't regret it.
And, young lady...
...I'm prepared to lose
it all so that you...
...and others like you
can fight me and...
...choose between what I
represent and you defend.
The choice must exist.
Because I cannot exist
without you nor you without me.
The choice must exist,
even when it's...
A move made in the dark?
A move made in the dark...
Do you remember...
...that night?
Sit down, and don't
drink any more.
Jack, what do you need?
I need the boxer's soul...
...through his own choice,
should go to you.
I could present it as
a threat to our survival.
That'd be dangerous...
...and bending the rules.
I know, Marina, but
for God's sake, this is...
...an unprecedented crisis.
Anyway, you owe me a favor.
Remember '39?
What happened in '39, sir?
Yes, what happened in '39?
Sorry to intrude.
We can come in
for a moment, can't we?
-You must think us tiresome.
-You are.
It's about the bank...
We hadn't forgotten,
now get out.
Of course, of course.
Is this good?
They'll tell us tomorrow.
It's dry.
Then we'll talk tomorrow.
If I'd had my way, we wouldn't
have disturbed you, but you...
...know how women
are, mine wants...
...a new kitchen and without...
...money, she won't let
me into the house.
-Do you understand?
-Of course.
But tell your wife
she'll have her new kitchen.
And that she's married
to a son of a bitch.
Though she probably knows.
No, remember what
the boss said.
Not to touch the two girls.
What do you do?
-Businessman. What about you?
-Businessman?
These spicks think
they can do anything.
Some I.D.
He's Swiss.
I always hated businessmen,
especially Swiss ones.
And are you
a businesswoman?
Not exactly.
What are you looking at?
Fancy me?
No, I don't want to
forget your face...
...in case we meet up again.
Really? And what'll you do
when we meet up again?
Shag me?
Do you see this?
I'm going to stick
it up your arse.
I'm sure you'd like it.
Women...
-I knew it was you.
-Yes.
And that you were in trouble.
It's a great novel.
It made me cry.
Me too.
Jack, we're too old to...
It can't be.
Whatever you say.
But don't forget...
...I'll be yours for ever
and ever...
-...until Hell...
-Until Hell freezes over.
I won't forget, Jack.
I won't.
Many! What are you doing?
Shouldn't you be at work?
I quit, Lola.
I'm going back to boxing.
You can't do that. You heard
what the doctors said.
They've never been
in the ring.
And I don't like
wearing a uniform.
-But Many...
-Shut up, you!
I've signed up for a fight.
I start training tomorrow at 7.
And that's it. Understood?
Talk to him...
Listen, Many.
You can't box again.
Of course I can.
If you do, I'm leaving.
Where I come from, the ring
is called...
''The brave man's stand.''
Up there, you're somebody.
Even when your opponent
knocks you down.
But when you knock
him down...
...when you knock him down,
you feel like a god.
You wouldn't understand...
Of course I do.
But you could be killed.
Sure.
So what?
Come on, Many, come on.
Tuck those elbows in, Many.
Keep your fists up.
Come on, come on.
That's it, champ.
Left... two... left...
-Seven...
-Come on, Many.
Move your feet
at the same time, Many.
Give me five.
Don't be such a softie.
Now you get up here.
-It's okay, I'm not tired.
-No. Get up here.
Be careful.
I won't hit him in the head.
Let's see who's the softie.
Let's see.
Come on, Carmen.
Carmen!
Many!
Many, Many!
What have you done?
Box.
You shouldn't
have insulted him.
I didn't think I had.
Is it true that in Heaven...
-...you're a prima donna?
-Yes.
Do you have a lot of fans?
I can't complain...
I thought we should talk.
Go ahead.
I'm worried, ma'am...
...that it's going to be
difficult for you to deliver.
Don't worry, we'll deliver it.
But I do worry. I worry a lot.
I know you've been fired.
So how will you
be able to pay?
I'll pay.
-What?
-I said I'll pay.
I hope so or your husband
will have a bad time...
Understood?
Perfectly. You've
explained things very well.
Then there's nothing else to
talk about. See you next week.
Very good, Lola.
You've got a big pair of balls.
I've had a lot of experience.
I've seen worse,
he's just a beginner.
I know human nature.
I was a politician once.
How did you get to Heaven?
Those were other times.
Fuck it!
If they know I betrayed
them, they'll stop me.
It's probably
just a routine check.
Everything'll be all right.
-How did it go?
-They gave me more time.
But they're beginning
to suspect.
Go to bed,
you fight tomorrow.
-Let's go now.
-I'll go when I want.
Come now or
I'll break your neck!
Touch me and you'll see.
What are you Iooking at?
Are you stupid or what?
You're a bully and a coward!
I'm sick of peopIe hitting me!
He's been
acting strangely lately.
He's just jealous.
Come on, Many!
-What's the matter?
-I came...
...to help him and
I've only made things worse.
You're an angel, not a nun.
And you're doing
your work well.
You even got him
to say sorry to his mother.
He didn't post the letter.
-Fucking hell!
-At the last...
...minute, he remembered his
mom loved his brother more.
-Are you the boxer's wife?
-Yes.
He's come round,
but there are problems.
-What problems?
-I'll be frank.
He's living on borrowed time.
He's got a brain injury.
It could haemorrhage
at any time.
You've been playing with fire.
Letting him fight
was tantamount to murder.
I'm filling a report.
-Can I go in and see him?
-Not now.
He needs to rest.
-Carmen!
-What!
I know how to get the money!
Lola, with your methods, I don't
think we'll get anywhere.
Just listen...
Christ!
But I need permission first.
Then, what has happened?
If everything turns out fine,
you won't sing again.
To tell you the truth,
I was a bit old-fashioned.
You won't even can get
the special note.
And if it goes wrong?
If it goes wrong,
you know what will happen.
You know the rules.
It seems it might rain.
I advise you not to do it.
Come on, Marina...
...you know I have to do it.
Don't you like the soup?
It's probably too salty.
Where are you going?
An interview for a job.
A job interview.
Lola, come here.
Sit down.
Many, I'm in a hurry.
I said sit down.
Not there. Here.
-Many, not now...
-Here!
I've done some bad things...
...but I don't want to hurt you.
What do you mean?
If there's another man...
...I'll break your neck.
But if there's
another woman...
...I'll kill the two of you.
You're impossible.
It's not that difficult.
It's your turn.
No, not like that.
What am I doing wrong?
Look, this is a gun.
Some people shit only for
seeing it.
But a small number
of people...
...only get scared
if they think you'll fire.
-How do they know?
-Your eyes.
They know by
the look in your eyes.
Right. Now you.
No, that's no good.
No, not like that.
Look, Lola, I don't
know what...
...will happen
to you if we fall...
...but I know what'll
happen to me.
I won't even be a
waitress again. They'll...
...fuck me up and make me
a housewife with...
...some bastard who treats me
like shit for a 100 years.
So pick up that
gun and think...
...of somebody you'd
like to shoot.
Go on!
I've never wanted
to shoot anybody.
Sure.
I don't believe it.
Come on, look into
your dark side.
Down, everybody! Come on!
On your knees!
The money in the bag!
You, hands behind your head!
Think of your families.
The money's not yours.
Get down! Get down!
Down, on your knees!
Come on, on your knees!
On your hands and knees, on
your hands and knees! Down!
The tape, Lola!
Hurry up!
Hands behind your back!
Hello! How're things going?
Okay.
How about you?
Well...
...you know what they say...
...''It never rains,
but it pours.''
Things'll pick up, you'll see.
I doubt it.
Your attention, please!
For security reasons, all doors
of this mall are closed.
All customers please
lie on the floor and...
...stay there until further
instructions are given.
Have you robbed the place?
Christ, what a nerve!
Carmen, I took the
bullets out...
...so nobody'd get hurt.
Drop the gun.
Drop it.
Easy now or I'll shoot.
Easy.
I've got one of them!
Come on, come on. Easy.
Don't move.
Don't move.
Come on.
I've got one of them!
If you move, I'll kill you.
Keep still.
Lola, what happened?
Lola!
Lola, can you hear me?
Lola!
It's nothing. It's okay.
Slide the gun over, Lola.
I can hardly move.
I've been shot.
I'm bleeding.
But you can't bleed.
You're an angel.
Christ... They're angels!
Not any more. I've been
a mortal for the last hour.
You screwed up, Lola.
Slide the gun over. Come on!
I wanted to help Many.
There was no other way.
Fighting evil with evil
has serious consequences.
Our rules are very strict.
-Good luck...
-Thanks.
What a load of crap!
What a load of crap.
Your lot will
never get anywhere.
Now go. Try and escape.
Your rules are
different from ours.
I already told you,
I keep my word.
Go on, pick it up.
Money's only paper, but it stirs
the same emotions as poetry.
A pity it always
belongs to somebody else.
Isn't it?
But things could be worse.
You know what they say...
...''Having money's
like being blonde.
It's more fun.''
But it isn't essential.
Drop the gun.
No, you drop yours. Or I'll
kill your friend and then you.
I don't give a shit.
Drop it or I'll kill you.
You won't shoot
and you know it.
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.
It's up to you.
-Carmen, you're bleeding!
-Let's go.
Hell's a strange place, Lola.
I want to tell you something...
...in case we don't get
out of this: the ones...
...who pass sentence have a
rare sense of humour, they...
...turn the rich into poor,
the famous into nobody's.
If you're a gangster like me...
...they turn you into a woman.
They know how much
it annoys us.
I meant to tell you before, but
that's how it is.
Does it bother you?
I could be your mother...
I'll show you a picture of
my mother. What do you want?
Put it away, son.
Don't get involved.
Now I've told you.
What do you say?
It's weird.
This is the place where
both thieves had left.
This is the supermarket...
...they left with
a bag of money...
...the quantity is not known...
Where have you two been?
Getting you out of a mess.
Shut up, you whore!
Both thieves died
in an assault with...
...the security forces.
Can you tell us
the name of the women?
You sold us out, you bastard!
Shut up, you fucking whore!
Okay, champ, get the gun.
Lola, they're going to kill us.
Give me the gun.
You didn't say you were
going to kill them.
-Think, Many.
-I'm not very good at that.
Carmen, their guns.
Get them, go on.
Now go, both of you.
Many, you're throwing
it all away...
...and all for a woman
who doesn't love you!
You never do what I say,
do you, Lola? Leave!
If they do, we'll kill you.
Yeah, that's what I thought,
but I'm a boxer, not a killer.
Now go!
Let's go.
He has made a decision.
It's the law.
Bye, Many.
Bye, Lola.
Why don't we
settle this like men?
Come on, then.
I'm the greatest.
I'm the champion.
Mother... mother...
CHAMBER OF JUSTICE
HEAVEN/HELL
-Do you know something?
-No.
But they are taking long,
I'm worried.
Me too.
Nancy suspects something.
What do you think are
his possibilities?
Fifty per cent.
His lawyers...
...have done a good job.
Besides, he has gotten
a female judge.
He has lied to his mother...
...and he has hit
many other women.
The judge won't like that.
Besides, the thing about
the man who killed him.
It was a fight that
wasn't planned.
It could be, but his lawyers...
...have blamed him.
I know you, you must
have as behind all this.
You said so.
We asked the judge Munroe...
...to apply the special
Thermopilas clause.
The Thermopilas clause.
The total sacrifice,
what a beauty.
And if I remember right...
...wasn't it the same
judge Munroe the one who...
...applied it the last time
on '59?
Exactly, I see you
have done your duties, too.
WHAT ARE WE WAITING
FOR IN THE FORUM?
TODAY THE BARBARIANS
ARRIVE.
Many's saved.
-He's with your lot now.
-Good.
I hope he'll be happy there.
We're saved too.
We're angels again.
Well, we have to return
the money.
Do we fuck!
The money's ours.
We'll go and spend it,
get drunk and go whoring.
Sure, you keep it.
Christ! Were you
really a politician?
Really.
I don't believe it!
Something to remember
me for...
Be seeing you.
Yes, see you.
Would you come
with us, please, miss?
Why? What's wrong?
A matter of
a stolen bracelet.
Now just tell us
who your accomplice is.
-That's not possible.
-Why?
Because I won't tell you.
That's up to you, but one way
or another you'll tell me.
Look, just relax.
Go home, help...
...help your wife bath
the kids.
I'm sure she'll appreciate it.
I assume you know the market
you robbed...
...was a front for distributing
counterfeit notes?
What do you say to that?
Well, you can depend on villains
to never let you down.
They don't change.
Can you wait over there?
Thank you.
Ticket to Geneva, please.
Geneva?
First class.
First class...
Right.
Cash or credit card?
Cash, honey.
I'm afraid it'll
take five minutes.
The computer's
playing up today.
I'm in no hurry.
Come on, Carmen,
it's not that bad.
They only gave
us three years.
We'll be out before
you notice.
No, I'm out on Monday.
My briefs made a
deal with the judge.
We have influence,
as you know.
I'm glad.
I don't know when
we'll meet again.
-Trust in fate.
-No...
Fate's unpredictable.
I'll ask Marina to let me go and
see you. She owes me a few.
When I go back,
I'll be in Circle 10.
So what?
I'll be a man.
And if you don't like me?
I'll take the risk.
No alternative.
