OK... Corral
There the outlaw band
made their final stand
OK... Corral
Oh, my dearest, one must die,
lay down my gun
Or take the chance
of losing you forever
Duty calls,
my back's against the wall
Have you no kind word to say
before I ride away?
Your love... your love
I need... your love
Keep the flame, let it burn
Until I return from
the gunfight at OK Corral
lf the Lord is my friend
We'll meet at the end
of the gunfight at OK Corral
Gunfight at OK Corral

OK... Corral
There the outlaw band
Made their final stand
OK... Corral
Oh, my dearest, one must die
Lay down my gun

Have you no kind word to say

Away
Boot Hill
Boot Hill, Boot Hill,
Boot Hill
Boot Hill
In the air, there's a chill,
there's a chill
So cold
Mighty cold, mighty cold,
mighty cold
So still
Mighty still, mighty still,
mighty still
There they lay,
side by side,
The killers that died
in the gunfight at OK Corral
OK... Corral
Gunfight at OK Corral.
Hello, Ed.
Where's Doc Holliday?
Over at the hotel,
more than likely.
He's been
expecting you...
Get word over there
I’m waiting for him.
No need to do that, Ed.
The whole town knows
you're waiting for him by now.
Before there's
another killing...
You just go on serving
your watered-down liquor
and keep out
of my business, Shanssey.
stinking drunk,
spoiling for a fight.
Whiskey!
He drew a gun
on Holliday.
Over there!
Have it your way, Ed.
Check your guns,
if you want to stay here.
Leave the bottle!
You don't stand a chance, Doc.
Bailey brought two men with him.
Oh, come on, honey,
let's cut out of here
while there's still time.
The whole town, including
that no-good marshal,
is laying for you.
Right or wrong, they're going
to hang you for another killing.
You know it.
Doc.
Oh, you ain't even
listening to me.
Now, Kate, Mr. Bailey
came all the way from Fort Worth
to see me
on a gentleman's matter.
''Gentleman.''
It wouldn't be hospitable
for me to leave town,
now, would it?
Don't start that gentleman
business with me again.
Well, it's a pure case
of ethics, but...
Well, that's something
a person like you
wouldn't understand.
Why do you always have
to treat me like I’m dirt?
You ain't no better than me!
That's debatable.
Oh, is it?
You and that
magnolia drippin'.
Well, let me tell you
something, Doc Holliday.
All them fancy clothes
and that smart talk
don't make you no gentleman!
You are dirt, just like me.
And I’m tired of hearing
about that...
Georgia plantation
and all them lily-white
friends of yours.
They're all gone now!
They're all gone!
Yes, they are...
and here I am with you.
Your family scraped the barrel
after the war wiped them out
just to send you
through dental school.
You sure turned out fine.
They'd be real proud of you.
Ow!
Don't you ever mention
my family again.
Doc, please...
Doc, please.
Forget about Bailey.
Let's get out of here
while there's still time.
Maybe...
Maybe we could
even go to Laredo
like you... you said
and do something about
that cough of yours.
It's getting worse all the time.
Your concern over my health
touches me deeply.
You know how
I feel about you.
I know exactly how you feel.
I don't know...
I don't know what I'd do
if anything
happened to you.
You'd lose your meal ticket,
wouldn't you?
That ain't nice
to say to me, Doc.
I’ve been good
to you, ain't l?
Why don't you think
about me once in a while?
All right, get over
to Shanssey's
and tell him
I’ll be there later.
Please, don't go there.
Do as I tell you.
I need some money.
Hello, Wyatt.
Cotton Wilson.
It’s been a long time.
Man, I’m plain worn out.
Hope you got some
good news for me.
Ike Clanton rode through here
three days ago, heading east.
Waco, I think.
Johnny Ringo was with him.
Rode through, heading east?
You didn't get my telegram.
I got it.
Well, why didn't you
hold him?
I had no quarrel
with Ike Clanton.
Nothing to hold him for.
Nothing to hold him for?
Why, man, he's got a dozen
charges against him.
I played this whole thing
so he'd be forced into Griffin.
I figured if there was one man
in Texas who could stop him,
you'd be the man.
Now, don't go getting your blood
heated up, Wyatt.
Cotton, it's Wyatt Earp
you're talking to.
Ten years ago, I watched
you walk single-handed
into a saloon
in Oklahoma City,
and knock out three of the
fastest guns in the territory.
Ten years
is a long time ago.
Getting old, I guess.
Anybody ever told me that
Cotton Wilson had gone yellow,
I would have called
them a liar.
You have no right
to say that to me, Wyatt.
I’ve bucked heads with the
toughest gangs on the frontier.
Then why didn't you
stop Ringo and Clanton?
Well, why didn't you?!
lf you can't handle it anymore,
turn in your badge!
Turn in my badge.
I’ve been a lawman for 25 years.
Worked every hellhole
in the territory.
You know what I got
to show for it?
A $1 2-a-month room in the back
of a cruddy boardinghouse,
and a tin star.
Think I like winding up
in a place like this?
It’s the end of the line
for me, Wyatt.
It'll happen to you someday.
Just like it happens
to all of us.
Where is that
yellow-livered skunk?
Slow down, Ed.
Holliday's only
trying to rile you.
What do you figure's
keeping Holliday?
Doc's going to make 'em
dangle a little.
Wyatt Earp.
Why, you old son of a gun.
Why didn't you let us know
you was riding into town?
Good to see you, John.
Hi, Marshal.
Come on, sit down.
Cigar?
I’ll be a son of a gun.
You've sure come a long ways
since the railroading
days in Cheyenne.
Ellsworth, Wichita,
now Dodge City.
Funny, I never figured
you for a lawman.
You was always
pretty reckless and wild.
Never figured myself
for a lawman, either.
Fix a nice steak
for Mr. Earp.
Yes, sir.
My personal stock.
How are the brothers?
Fine. Virgil and
Morgan are married.
Virgil and Morgan married?
What do you know.
John, I need some help.
Anything I can do for you.
Ike Clanton and Johnny Ringo
rode through here
three days ago.
They got a dozen counts
against them.
I telegraphed Cotton
to hold them,
but he crossed me up.
Cotton's skidded a long way.
You know anything?
Wish I did, but...
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Doc Holliday played poker
with them.
Maybe he heard something.
Bartender!
Bartender!
whiskey around here!
Ed Bailey.
Doc Holliday
killed his brother.
The guy was begging for it.
He came in drunk,
cheated at cards.
He pulled a gun on Doc.
Did you ever
meet Holliday?
We crossed trails once.
He was a dentist then.
You know, I’ve yet
to see the guy pick a fight.
Trouble just naturally
seems to find him.
It’s gotten so every would-be
gunman on the frontier
wants the honor of
putting him in Boot Hill.
You know how it is when
a man gets a reputation.
I sure do.
Where is Holliday?
I better get to him
while the getting's good.
He's at the hotel.
Keep that steak warm,
I’ll be back.
You ain't missing much;
it's longhorn.
Holliday.
Sit down, make
yourself at home,
just like you were invited.
I don't know if you
remember me...
I remember you--
Wyatt Earp.
Pulled a tooth for you
ten years ago.
lf I knew
when I had you in the chair
what you were going to turn out
to be, l...
I hear you've taken up
a new occupation.
It’s too bad;
you were a good dentist.
My patients didn't
like my coughing.
I’d like some information.
The name of this game
is solitaire.
I’m in a position to do
a little horse trading.
Good evening,
Mr. Earp.
I know something
that would interest you.
You don't know a thing
that would interest me.
Suppose I was to tell you
that Ed Bailey...
has a small derringer
hidden in his boot.
Left or right?
Left.
I’d say that was
good information--
Bailey's left-handed.
Ike Clanton and Johnny Ringo
rode through here
three days ago.
You played cards with them.
Which way were they heading?
Beats me.
I thought we were
making a deal.
That's what you said.
I didn't make any deals.
But you know where
they went, don't you?
Look, you're
interrupting my game.
You've got a real big hate
for the law, haven't you?
Is there any reason
why I shouldn't?
Your brother, Morgan,
ran me out
of Deadwood last year
and impounded $1 0,000
of my money.
As a matter of fact,
you've got brothers
marshaling all over
the frontier, haven't you?
I’ll see you again,
Holliday.
lf you're around.
What did you find out?
Not a thing.
It’s my hunch they're
headed for Tombstone.
Ike's old man has
a big ranch there.
But I can't be sure.
Isn't your brother Virgil
a marshal at Tombstone?
That's right.
I sent him a telegram,
asking him to be
on the lookout for him,
just in case.
What are you going to do?
There's nothing I can do.
The trail's ice cold.
I’m heading back for Dodge City
in the morning.
Mr. Holliday.
Yes.
Would you care to settle up
your bill now?
Well, uh...
What I mean, sir, is
we didn't know whether you
were checking out or not.
You'll have word
in 1 5 minutes.
Doc, you're walking
into a stacked deck.
lf Bailey don't get you,
the marshal will.
You'd be smart to get out
while you can.
You act as if you want
to get killed.
Maybe I do.
Holliday...
let's check your gun.
Good evening, Harry.
The usual.
Yes, sir.
I understand
there's a gentleman
in from Fort Worth
to see me.
This gentleman should have
taught his brother better
than to deal
with a marked deck.
Well, if you happen to see
this, uh... gentleman,
tell him I’ll be waiting
for him at Boot Hill.
He'll have only one direction
to travel from there--
down.
Come to think of it...
he's no gentleman at all.
He's a son
of a yellow-bellied sow.
All right, Doc, let's go.
Right on cue.
What's the charge?
We'll think of one.
I’m sure you will.
Thanks, Harry.
All right, get him
out of here.
It’s all over, folks.
Break it up.
Come on, step up to the bar.
Free drinks, on the house.
Come on, give me
some beer, bartender.
Ah, it's always a mess
after a killing.
Looks like Doc spoiled
everybody's fun.
He's crazy, but he's
got nerve, though--
plenty of nerve.
Shanssey, Mr. Earp, what are you
going to about this?
You saw what happened.
They had no right
to take Doc off.
They're going to do something
to him, I know it.
Kate Fisher,
friend of Doc's.
He's going to be framed.
You saw it--
Bailey pulled a gun on him.
Wait a minute, Miss Fisher,
take it easy.
Why don't you just relax
and let the law handle this.
There ain't no law
in this town.
I never saw a man beg more
to get his brains blown out.
Please, you've got
to help him.
Doc Holliday's none
of my business.
Please, Mr. Earp.
I don't want
any part of him.
I don't even like him.
I’m sorry.
Good night.
Kate, I can have a
pair of saddle horses
put round back
of the hotel.
That's as much as I can do.
With the feeling
against Doc,
I wouldn't stay in
business ten minutes
if they knew
I’d helped him.
Ten, please.
Wilson live here?
Why, no, sir.
They're just holding
Doc Holliday
upstairs in his room.
Oh.
Mr. Earp.
Look, Miss Fisher, I told you
this is none of my business.
I don't care what you
think of me and Doc.
There's a lynch mob
starting across the street.
That's your business,
ain't it?
Don't make no difference
whether Doc is right or wrong.
He don't deserve to be hung
by a pack of animals.
You're getting out of here.
Since when have you taken
to rescuing gamblers
in distress?
Don't take it personal, Doc.
I just don't like lynchings.
What are we waiting for?
Not yet.
I’d say now is
a very good time.
Hey, Sturges' barn!
That's it.
Get going down
the back stairs.
Much obliged, Marshal.
I’ll see you in Dodge City
and thank you properly.
You can thank me properly
by staying out of Dodge City.
More water!
More water!
...Boot Hill
Boot Hill, Boot Hill,
Boot Hill
Boot Hill
In the air, there's a chill,
there's a chill
So cold
Mighty cold, mighty cold,
mighty cold
So still
Mighty still, mighty still,
mighty still
Wyatt Earp, they say,
saved Doc Holliday
From old Boot Hill...
Boot Hill
Boot Hill, Boot Hill,
Boot Hill
Boot Hill
Over there, there's a chill,
there's a chill
So cold
Mighty cold, mighty cold,
mighty cold
So still
Mighty still, mighty still,

Wyatt roamed the West,
and though he fought the best
By nature he preferred it
nice and peaceful
Sort of slow
And sort of easy-go
But he was quick on the draw
And Wyatt's word was law
Was law, was law...
Whoa.
How about that?
A little out of place
for Dodge City,
wouldn't you say?
That's strictly
big-city stuff.
Looks like she's going
to stay a while.
Got a trunk.
I got to go on a posse.
That's what I came
to see you about.
Chief Dullknife is
on a rampage again.
I’m going to have
to borrow your deputies.
You're always short of men.
Who's the girl?
Yeah, who's the girl?
Girl? What girl?
Oh. I was too busy finding out
that Doc Holliday and his
lady friend have just checked in
at the Dodge House.
Doc Holliday?
I told him to keep out
of Dodge City.
I’d better get over there
before he unpacks.
You going to lend me
your deputies?
Well, all right,
but I have to keep
Charlie here with me.
You can have the
rest of the boys.
And don't forget to get back
before those cattle drives.
You know how business picks up
when the cowpokes hit town.
Mario, go on out
and get some fresh air.
The mayor's
welcoming committee, eh?
I thought I told you
to stay out of Dodge City.
I like a sharp razor,
don't you?
Care for a shave?
There's a stage for Abilene
in the morning.
I want you to be on it.
Can't.
The marshal of Abilene
sent me here.
As a matter of fact,
I wish someone would write
you fellas a new speech.
I’ve had the same one
in the last five towns.
All right, you'll stay
in your hotel room, then,
till day after tomorrow.
I’ll personally escort you
to the westbound train.
Wyatt, you've got
to face a hard fact.
I’m in a state of complete
financial collapse.
I don't even have
the price of a ticket.
Shanssey told me you had
quite a bankroll
back there in Griffin.
Shanssey ought to know.
He had $1 0,000 of mine
in his safe.
You know what that
son of a gun did?
You'll recall I had to leave
town rather hastily.
Those two horses in
back of the hotel
cost me $5,000 apiece.
Now, how about that?
Towel, please.
Oh, thank you.
Everyone puts such
an outlandish value
on my life.
Say, Wyatt...
how much do you earn?
About $1 00 a month
and two dollars an arrest?
You trying to bribe me?
Oh, no.
Not you.
I feel compelled to offer you
an honest business proposition.
That's not bad.
You got any money saved?
Some.
Going to buy a small ranch
or a country store someday, huh?
Well, I’ll make it easier
for you.
You stake me
to a thousand dollars
and I’ll split my winnings.
The cowboys are coming
and the stakes will be big.
Fifty-fifty, huh?
Now actually,
any number of people
would be glad to back me
for ten percent, but...
I like you, Wyatt Earp.
I like your cut.
Why so generous
with the split?
Look, a barber needs this.
You're a lawman,
you need a gun.

Money's just a tool
of my trade.
Of course, you will
guarantee you won't lose.
I never lose.
You see, poker's played
by desperate men
who cherish money.
I don't lose because
I have nothing to lose,
including my life.
Is it a deal?
Of all the low-down gall.
Ah, well...
You're just going
to have to stake me
to a railroad ticket.
Holliday, I’ve done
some foolish things
in my life.
I’m about to do another.
I’m going to let you
stay in town.
Why so generous?
Let's say I like your cut.
You can stay and you can play
on one condition:
No knives, no guns
and no killings.
No knives, no guns, no killings.
That's it.
You have my word
as a gentleman.
Just one more thing.
You ought to treat that woman
decent or leave her.
Kate?
Yes, poor old Kate.
She stands for everything I hate
in Doc Holliday.
Oh, leave two bits
for the barber, will you?
Well, I found out all
about your lady fair.
Hey, where'd you
get the new gun?
Buntline made it
for me special.
What lady fair?
It’s sure beautiful--
isn't that barrel too long?
No, good balance,
just right.
What's beautiful?
Hand-tooled, too, huh?
What are you talking about?
Well, that girl that came in
on the stage
day before yesterday.
Oh, yeah, I remember;
what about her?
Well, she's staying
over at Mrs. D's place.
They tell me
she's got a trunkful
of the most elegant clothes
you've ever seen.
Some of them dresses
clean from Paris, France.
She's five-foot six,
weighs 1 20 pounds,
red hair, green eyes...
What is she doing here?
Gambler.
Very funny.
Well, if you
think that's funny,
why don't you take
a little walk
over to the
Longbranch Saloon.
You'll die laughing.
Hello, Wyatt.
What's the trouble?
I think I’m going to have
to break up that game.
Can't do that, Wyatt.
There's no law against
women gambling.
I know, but every time
there's a woman at the tables,
there's trouble, you know that.
Sorry, game's over.
Wyatt, this is Laura Denbow.
Kelly, you're the mayor
of this town.
We agreed there'd be
no women gambling
on the north side.
Miss Denbow's marker
is respected
for $1 0,000 anywhere
in the West.
We all consider her
an exception.
Not in Dodge City,
she isn't.
So you're the famous Wyatt Earp.
Lawman, judge and jury.
That's right, Miss Gambler--
start with you
and we'll have every tramp
on the south side over here.
Who's a tramp?
Shut up and keep
out of this, cowboy.
You're talking to a lady!
It appears the marshal
hasn't met a lady before.
You're in a saloon,
playing a man's game.
Why should you be
treated like a lady?
And you ain't no gentleman.
That's all for tonight,
Miss Denbow.
Take your hands off her.
Hold it, Charlie.
I’m tired of you
pushing people around.
Now, go for your gun.
I’m going to kill you!
I don't have a gun, cowboy.
I’m unarmed.
Stay where you are!
You're drunk.
You don't know
what you're doing.
Now, give me that gun before
you get into real trouble.
I don't stand
for nobody talking
like that to no lady.
You stand real still.
And just give me that gun.
I ain't no gunman.
I couldn't kill anybody.
I know that, cowboy.
You were just trying
to impress the lady.
Charlie--
take him down
and sober him up
and get him out of town.
You're under arrest.
For what, Mr. Earp?
You just saw it--
disturbing the peace.
Wait a minute, Wyatt.
It’s all right, Mayor Kelly.
The marshal's only
trying to save
the good name of Dodge City.
Besides, I might like
to see the inside of a jail.
Don't you think you better wait
for a few of your deputies?
I might be desperate.
I’ll let you go,
if you promise
to do your gambling
south of the deadline.
South of the deadline?
No, I think I’ll stay.
Perhaps the judge isn't as
righteous as the marshal.
Well, aren't you going
to open the door?
Oh, l, uh...
won't be needing these
while I’m here.
Why don't you buy
yourself a new halo?
The one you're wearing's
too tight.
Close the door, Marshal.
Locked her up?
That's right,
disturbing the peace.
I could get her out.
$500 says you can't.
Make it the $1 ,000
I owe you.
Double or nothing.
It’s a bet.
I’ll be back in 30 minutes.
Good evening, Charlie.
Oh, hiya, Doc.
Man, this 1 2 on and 1 2 off
is sure ruining my homework.
I spend half my life
on that dern paperwork.
Care for a nip?
Doc, you know why I don't
like drinking on duty.
What's the occasion?
I’d like to bail out
Miss Denbow.
Hit me.
I got 1 9.
Twenty.
Can't do it, Doc.
She's got to appear
in court tomorrow.

Think I’ll stand on these.
Twenty-one.
Oh, I’ll wait for Wyatt.
I sure hope Bat gets
back with our deputies
before them cowboys
hit town.
Blackjack.
I got one, too.
You know, Doc, if we
was playing for real,
I’d just be compelled
to have a look at that deck.
Oh, I’d be compelled
to ask you to try it.
Use mine, huh?
Good thing Wyatt
don't let us
go around drawing
these things.
Somebody might get hurt.
Well... I got
to go have a look
at the prisoners and horses.
Watch the office for me,
will you, Doc?
Sure thing, Charlie.
I never could get the hang
of these things.
What are you doing here?
Wyatt, I’d like to
bail out Miss Denbow.
She happens to be a lady.
No favors, Holliday.
Let's say you release her
in exchange for
some information.
You don't know a thing
that would interest me.
Uh, suppose l
were to tell you
that Shanghai Pierce is
bringing his herd here.
Shanghai Pierce, huh?
I take it you've had
some run-ins with him.
I had to bat him over the head
once or twice, when he got drunk
and tried to shoot up Wichita.
Not a bad guy,
just forgot to grow up.
Well, he's aiming
to shoot up Dodge City,
and he's hired Ringo to make
sure you don't spoil his fun.
Oh, and what's more, he, uh...
He's put a price of $1 ,000
on your head, dead.
What else is new?
Well, l, I thought
it was kind of amusing,
a price on a lawman's head.
Look, Holliday,
as long as I’m the law here,
not one of those cowpokes
is going to cross
that deadline with a gun.
I don't care if his name
is Shanghai Pierce.
Well spoken.
I’ll repeat those words
at your funeral.
How about releasing
Miss Denbow?
Nothing doing.
Look, you made a deal.
You made the deal.
I didn't agree to
a thing, remember?
Charlie, you're working
for a crook.
Oh, yeah?
Go on home, Charlie,
and turn in.
I’ll finish these reports.
Thanks.
Everything's quiet.
Good night.
G'night.
Wyatt, you ought
to turn her loose.
She's got no business
behind bars.
I think Charlie's right.
Let her out.
Conscience?
Maybe I like her.
Tell Kelly
she's to play
in the side room.
I don't want her gambling
on the main floor.
Good evening, Miss Denbow.
Good evening.
Come on, Laura, we've got
business to take care of.
Thank you.
Marshal.
Good evening, Mr. Earp.
Good evening, Miss Denbow.
Good evening, Mr. Earp.
Pair of deuces.
I’ll check to the lady.
Fifty.
I’ll stay.
Too steep for me.
I’m in.
$50, and I’ll
make it $50 more.
I’m in for the $50.
Deal.
Doc...
Queen of clubs.
It’s almost morning.
Jack of spades, three tens.
You didn't answer me.
I’ll make it $1 00.
Doc!
Go buy yourself a drink.
And I’ll raise you $1 00.
Too much for me.
$200 to me.
I’ll call you.
I’ll go along with the lady.
Four deuces.
Gentlemen, we've been
out-classed.
Thank you, gentlemen.
I think I’ll call it a night.
Will you cash me in, Frank?
Good night.
Good night, Mayor Kelly.
May I see you home?
No, thank you, Doc.
Good night.
Good night.
How about a little draw, boys?
All right.
I’ll get my ante in there.
Good night.
Johnny, I need Luke Short.
Richie Bell
and two of his boys
held up the bank at Salina.
They killed the cashier.
They're heading this way.
I sent Luke to Abilene, Wyatt.
I’m sorry.
How soon do you
have to pull out?
Right away, if I expect
to pick up their trail.
Doggone it, Luke's
the only one in town
who can handle a gun.
What about Charlie Bassett?
Somebody's got to mind the town.
Want a gunhand?
You?

I do handle one pretty well.
The only trouble is
those best able
to testify to my aim
aren't around for comment.
I’ll take care of it alone.
Suit yourself.
Hold up your right hand.
Do you solemnly
swear to uphold...
Oh, this is ridiculous!
You're deputized.
Grab some gear,
I’ll get the horses.
Now, wait a minute, don't
I get to wear a tin star?
Not on your life!
Medicine.
For a smart gambler, you
sure play sucker odds.
You're going to be dead
inside of a year.
What do you know
about odds, preacher?
This kind of cough
doesn't go away.
Why don't you get out of
those stinking saloons?
Pack up and go live
in the mountains.
Not me.
You're just ornery enough
to live to a ripe old age.
No, I’m not going to let it
drain me out slow.
Sure.
Play it hard and fast.
Listen, Wyatt,
the only thing
I’m really scared of
is dying in bed.
I don't want to go
little by little.
Someday, somebody's
got to out-shoot me,
and it'll be
over with real quick.
Earp, I didn't come along
to hear you preach a sermon.
You know, I’ve been wondering
about that.
Why did you come?
Well, if I stick around
long enough,
sooner or later you've gotto put your head in a noose.
I’m going to bail you out.
I’ve only got one debt
in this world,
and I don't like
owing it to you.
You don't owe me a thing.
I’ve never needed
anybody in my life,
and I sure don't need
Doc Holliday.
You're pretty positive
about that.
As far as I’m concerned,
you can get on your horse
and keep riding.
No, thanks.
I think I’ll stay.
You know, Wyatt, you and l
are pretty much alike, actually.
Both of us live with a gun.
The only differenceis that badge.
What's the matter,
preacher?
Don't you like
being preached at?
Shut up and go to sleep.
Richie Bell won't
be robbing any more banks.
I thought you were asleep.
No, it figured.
Let's head back to Dodge.
I want to get in a bed.
What for?
They're not going any place.
Neither are we.
I’m getting some sleep.
Get out of those
stinking saloons.
Pack up, live
in the mountains.
Charlie.
Hi.
I’ll go in and fix up
a coroner's report.
Thanks a lot, Doc.
You and I are even.
Not yet.
Not until the debt's
paid in full, Marshal.
I hear you did some
pretty fancy shooting, Doc.
Well, it's...
all in a day's work
for a deputy.
You all right?
Find Kate and tell her
to come up to the hotel
right away, will you?
Kate hasn't been around
for a while, Doc.
What do you mean?
I mean nobody's seen her
on this side of town
since you rode out.
Should I get a doctor?
Good morning, Laura.
Well, I never thought
I’d be glad to see you.
Something wrong?
My horse has gone lame.
Right forefoot.
Hoof's split.
Better not ride him in.
Aw...
Leave him here,
he won't go far.
I’ll send
the blacksmith out.
Nice you
happened along.
I didn't happen along.
I know you ride out
this way every day.
Come on, I’ll give you
a ride into town.
Unless you'd rather
walk six miles.
Better hold on tight.
Tighter.
Doc, what are you doing up
this time of day?
It’s only 3:00.
I’m on a health bender.
Up before noon,
take a 20-yard walk.
What's the action here?
Uh, picking up the hardware
as soon as the cowboys hit town.
Sure don't look like
Bat's going to get back
with our deputies soon enough.
Where's Kate?
Where is she, Charlie?
Well, it's...
kind of touchy, Doc.
l... l...
Yes?
You promised Wyatt
there wouldn't be
any gunplay, Doc.
Now, you can't...
Where is she, Charlie?
Wally's Hotel.
Ringo blew into town, and
Kate's taken up with him.
Sure is a lot of beef
coming in here.
This is just the beginning.
Wait till the...
Look, Doc,
a gunfight right now
could cause Wyatt
a lot of trouble.
A lot of trouble.
Sure is a mess
of cattle here.
Get out and stay out,
you no-good tramp!
And don't come back!
Widened my mind...
My mind is to marry, love,
and leave you behind.
So you got homesick.
Well, well.
lf it ain't
the little deputy.
You've been gone
for three days.
I didn't think you'd notice.
You've been gallivanting
all over the country
with Mr. Virtue.
I was sick, Kate.
I needed you.
Why don't you put a rope
around my neck and...
and pull on it
when you want me?
Can't stay away.
Just can't stay away,
can you?
Oh, leave me alone, Doc.
Always got to crawl
back to your gutter.
Maybe I wouldn't
if you ever noticed
I was alive!
What difference
does it make to you
where I go or who
I take up with?
Shut up!
Get your things together,
you're leaving.
She's staying here.
Keep out of this, Ringo.
You got no right to
come busting in here.
I’m talking to Kate.
Take a walk.
Anything you got to say,
you can say in front of him.
You slut.
Wait a minute, Holliday.
You don't talk to
my woman like that.
''Your woman.''
Anybody's woman.
I’m going to
blast you apart.
I don't have a gun, Ringo.
You got one now.
Reach.
I’m not fighting.
He won't fight.
He promised Wyatt Earp
he'd be a good little boy.
I heard you made
your reputation
against a bunch of drunks.
Go on, reach.
I’m not fighting.
Well, have a drink, then.
Oh, Doc.
It was a lovely dance.
I’m sorry I have
to leave so soon.
You're breaking
a lot of hearts.
Good night, Mayor Kelly.
Good night, Miss Denbow.
May I take you somewhere?
No, thank you,
it's just a short way.
It’s early, and I have
to ride up to the bluffs.
Oh, it is lovely here.
I’m glad I came.
You've lost your poker face.
You look like
a scared little girl.
I’m not scared.
And I’m certainly
not a little girl.
Why did you come
out here with me?
I wish I could answer that.
I don't know.
I’ll tell you why you came.
Frisky bunch, eh, Ringo?
Yeah.
This ought to learn 'em
once and for all
who owns the cow towns!
Yeah.
Shanghai Pierce is in town.
His men are hoo-hawing
Front Street.
Now, see if you find Wyatt,
quick as you can
and get some help.
I’ll try to hold them off.
I don't want anybody
out there on the streets!
Pierce, call off your men
before somebody gets hurt.
Tell your boss I’m waiting
for his personal invitation.
You're under arrest, Pierce.
You hear that, Ringo?
I’m under arrest.
I heard.
Sure are noisy.
Sure are.
Let's quit.
I want to get out of here.
You just keep dealing.
I’m not breaking this run.
Hit me.
Doc, please.
Deal.
Well... what have we here?
A dance.
Now, ain't that nice?
You folks going
to invite us in?
Ain't very hospitable,
are they, Boss?
You better get that scum
of yours south of the deadline.
You hear that, boys?
These are respectable folks.
They're good enough
to take our money.
I say my men are good enough
to dance with your women.
My boys want to dance!
Piano player, make some music!
Make it lively!
Hello, Shanghai.
Well...
Now my day is complete.
You and me are going to settle
for this scar
you gave me in Wichita.
Unbuckle your guns, boys,
and come on down
to the calaboose with me.
You better start praying, Earp.
You pulled your last bluff.
Start thinking
straight, Shanghai,
before you get
into too much trouble
and you can't get out of it.
Let's work him over, Boss.
That's a real good idea.
Maybe your friends
would like to see
how tough you really are.
I’d like to see you
do a dance, Marshal.
That's mighty
brave talk, Shanghai,
with 20 men behind you.
Let's you and me step out
into the street, alone.
Oh, no, you don't sucker me
into that!
Can't bluff
your way out, huh?
All right, boys,
take this skunk.
You gentlemen
made such a racket,
Frank Loving
was too scared to deal.
You busted my winning streak.
Fun's over, boys.
Unbuckle 'em.
Let's shoot it out.
All right, Shanghai?
Go ahead, draw, all of you.
But you get it first, Shanghai.
And you second, Ringo.
Well, call the play.
I’ll give you five seconds
to unbuckle your guns.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
We had enough fun, boys.
Unbuckle 'em.
Harry, Jackson,
get the hardware.
Get moving.
Doc!
Anybody else
want to try their luck?
Get moving.
Come on, keep moving!
All of you!
All right, Doc, we
ain't finished yet.
You would have been,
but I feel in
a charitable mood tonight.
