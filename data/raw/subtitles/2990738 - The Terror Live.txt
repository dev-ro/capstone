Morning rush hour traffic
has all cleared up.
Vehicles are moving well
on all highways and bridges.
One thing to be aware of.
There was a presidential address
at the National Assembly.
Streets around the area
will be briefly closed off.
Have a great morning!
That's all for the traffic report.
It's 9:31 AM Monday.
This is YOON Young-hwa's
Daily Topic.
We're taking callers' opinions
on the new tax reform.
You're on the air.
Hello?
Hello. Good day.
Please introduce yourself.
I'm PARK No-kyu from Seoul.
I'm a construction worker.
Hello, Mr. PARK.
The biggest controversy is in
less tax for those with high income.
What are your thoughts
on this matter?
I live alone.
All I have is a TV and a fridge,
but my electricity came to $170!
I called Korea Electric
to complain.
- But I must pay or they'll cut...
- Mr. PARK?
Today's topic is on
the new tax reform.
Right.
Isn't electricity tax, too?
How can the government
do this to a good citizen like me?
'Electricity is tax, too'.
Thank you for your opinion.
I can imagine how hard
it must be.
Next caller, please.
Wait! Don't hang up!
Hi, my name is KIM Hee-eun.
Hello, Ms. KIM Hee-eun.
I watched your news every day.
It's great to talk with you.
Thank you.
Your thoughts on the matter?
As a housewife, I think...
Don't hang up!
We apologize
for the confusion.
We'll be back after
these commercials.
What was that?
Why isn't it getting
disconnected?
- Check the lines.
- Okay.
I was talking!
How could you!
What did I do?
Why hang up on me!
Please, sir.
Could you hang up
so we can keep the show going?
How can you do that?
So rude!
Treating me like I'm weird!
Where'd YOON Young-hwa go?
I know you're there!
Sir, that's it for today.
Thank you.
Why can't I say
what I have to say!
No one listens to me!
Still can't?
It won't disconnect.
He has to hang up...
Mr. YOON?
Listen carefully.
It's a big announcement.
I have a bomb.
I'll blow up a bridge.
I'll keep working on it.
I'll blow it up.
Heard me?
We don't take prank calls.
Please stop or we'll report you.
I gave it a lot of thought.
I have to do it.
Then, go ahead.
Let's see you do it!
You can't, can you?
I'm not lying.
I'll really blow it up.
Then, blow it up fast.
We'd like to see that.
Watch what you say.
I'm not joking.
I really have a bomb.
I warned you.
Damn bastard talks too much!
So, go ahead!
You son of a bitch!
I cut the audio.
But we can't disconnect...
00:17 LEFT IN COMMERCIALS
Just make up something?
That would be good.
Hold on.
Our show's only been a week.
Problems like this
come up at first.
It's just a slap on the wrist.
Just relax.
I'll handle this.
We apologize for the confusion
in the phone lines.
The most controversial part
is cutting transfer income tax.
Then, the rich pay less
and the poor pay more.
Thus, it is criticized
for favoring the rich.
YOON's Daily Topic has been
discussing this...
For a week,
with experts
and their opinions...
What
The hell!
Hello?
It's me again.
The number is not in service...
PARK NO-KYU...
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
MA PO BRIDGE BOMBING TERROR
EXCLUSIVE
Police. How can I help you?
Police. May I help you?
I'm sorry.
Wrong number.
- JUNG! Wait!
- Hello?
Where are you calling?
- I'm reporting him.
- Give me that!
- Report him to where?
- The police...
Use your head!
Listen.
We're the only ones
who know about this, right?
Yes.
His announcement
didn't go on the air, right?
Right.
You're in luck.
- Recorded his call?
- Yes.
Save it here.
Don't report him?
He said he'll call back.
We can report him later.
But we should report him!
Why you!
Since when were you
so law-abiding?
Don't you get it?
The press is on the fritz!
But we're the only ones who know!
How lucky is that?
It's our chance.
- We gotta cover this!
- Okay...
If he calls back,
we'll top the ratings!
Right.
Give it to me.
Stay put.
I'll go ask for news time.
- I can call the newsroom.
- I got this!
Stay put.
CHIEF CHA
I'm busy! Don't call me!
Chief! Wait!
Everyone listen!
It happened close by.
We get the first newsflash!
If we don't, we're screwed!
3 minutes passed!
Get to work!
Know why it blew?
I'm busy! Bye!
Hold on...
Listen.
You stay out this!
It's a terrorist act.
I have a bomb.
I'll blow up a bridge.
What's that!
It blew up right after.
He did it.
Did it go on the air?
Not yet.
I called you first.
Okay, bring the recording
and come quick.
I can't.
He said, he'll call right back.
Why you!
Life is funny.
I got divorced, cut as anchor,
and demoted to radio.
My life sucked!
Maybe that all happened
for this.
Come up and we'll talk.
This is my chance
of a lifetime.
So come up and let's talk!
I don't think so.
What's with you?
You'll backstab me again
and take over.
Not this time.
What do you want?
To return as news anchor.
Fine, I'll talk to the Director.
What do you need?
Can you send in a camera now?
You take the control desk
and let's go live with this.
How many cameras left?
They all went out.
I'll send one.
Don't trust anyone.
Don't let this out.
Got it?
I get my anchor seat back.
We made a deal.
Send a camera to our radio.
I recorded this.
Just so you know.
An explosion at Mapo Bridge
took place at 9:35 AM.
Eye witnesses claim the bridge
collapsed in a sudden explosion.
Let's join our reporter
at the scene.
As you can see,
Mapo Bridge is severed.
Most of the cars made it out
before the explosion...
LEE JI-SU
What floor are you on?
I'm kind of busy.
Let's talk later.
Wait!
The caller is unavailable.
Please leave a message.
Hello?
Why'd you hang up?
Golfing with that bastard
or something?
Anyway, I'm going back
to doing news.
If things work out...
Maybe we can get back together?
I'll call you
when it's all over.
What did they say?
- He didn't call, right?
- No.
- Didn't report him?
- No.
Aren't you waiting
for him to call?
Why do you think
he called us?
To get on the air?
Then, we should go on the air
so he'll call.
So, let's prepare.
Prepare what?
To go on the air. Now.
Yes, sir.
Mapo Bridge has suddenly...
Ready?
Hold on.
...suddenly collapsed.
10 seconds left
in commercials.
This is YOON's Daily Topic.
As you all know, an explosion
at Mapo Bridge occurred.
I'd like to inform our listeners
the possibility of a terrorist act.
Before the explosion, a man
claiming to be the terrorist called.
I believe he is now
on the line with us.
Hello?
This is YOON Young-hwa.
Yes?
First, let me clarify one thing.
Did you cause the explosion
at Mapo Bridge?
I told you I'll blow it up.
I see.
Please don't hang up.
We'll continue
after these commercials.
Sir? Still there?
Why am I not on the air?
You will be soon.
We're airing this
as a newsflash.
You mean,
my voice will go on TV?
You're quick.
Isn't that better for you?
Really?
How long till we start?
Give me 5 minutes.
A TV newsflash?
But that's not what we...
Hold on.
I was going to tell you.
Just stay out and come later.
It's okay.
You'll be back later.
I'm here. Don't worry.
Yes, sir. We'll report it.
Ready on standby?
What's the story?
Nothing yet.
We'll set up the big picture
and start from there.
Okay.
Chief? I'm Producer JUNG
of Daily Topic.
- You can't just come in and...
- Producer JUNG?
The CEO and Director
approved of this.
Our Director?
He didn't hear?
Your program's been canceled.
Sorry, pal.
I'll buy you drinks.
Get to work! Move it!
What?
You sent Ji-su there?
Worried about your ex-wife?
Why would she go there?
She insisted on going.
She won't listen to me.
Looking for trouble.
We can't use her footage
anyway.
Play up the human, drama code.
Something's up with the bastard.
Go with 'Who is the terrorist
and why'.
Then, he surrenders at the end.
He wanted to commit suicide,
but changed after talking to me.
Draw it out so that he's crying
and in handcuffs at the end.
- Can you do it?
- Yes.
30 seconds left.
Wait! This is ours.
What's the rush?
Give me 5 minutes
to make a call.
We gotta start!
Other stations have newsflashes.
Let's change ties.
Nothing on the guy yet?
So, we go live with this
and it's over!
Let's start. Get ready.
- Okay!
- Okay!
- Hello?
- Yes?
I apologize for the delay.
Please think through
what you want to say.
But what about my pay?
We can't pay a terrorist.
We don't have money.
With my voice on,
the ratings will skyrocket.
I called, got you the newsflash,
and the station takes all the money?
That's crazy.
- Where did you hear that?
- I can take this elsewhere.
Hold, please.
How much?
How much are you thinking?
$2,179,245.00
What is the money for?
If you want to know,
deposit it to this number.
It's an investment.
Because of me,
you'll get more commercials.
What if we can trace
your account?
If I get caught during the show,
it's your loss, too.
Should we wire the money?
We'll pay you.
First, let's begin.
If we lose the timing,
we can't pay you.
Sorry, that won't do.
I'll go with another station,
if you're not interested.
We have a call from a man
who claims to be the terrorist.
KTN news is preparing
an exclusive interview with him.
No deal?
Is this really about money?
The chance to say what you want
is what's important.
No one else will listen to you
like me.
But I need that money.
We'll pay you every penny,
plus the chance to talk.
They'll never let your voice
go on live without editing.
They care about the show
not you.
We're different.
You can swear and say anything.
I'll help you.
Now, it's time to start.
Any later and this call
will lose merit.
Okay. I got the money.
Let's begin.
You really paid him?
Just get the ratings up.
Then, you'll be the anchor
on tomorrow's news.
10 seconds left.
We're about to begin.
When I ask you a question,
just speak your mind.
I'll sort it out. Okay?
SNC has decided to broadcast
the phone conversation live.
We have an exclusive interview
with the terrorist.
Here is the exclusive.
This is YOON Young-hwa.
The country is at shock
over an unprecedented bombing.
SNC will broadcast live the phone
conversation with the terrorist.
Hello? Can you hear me?
Yes,I can see you.
Your identity or why you bombed
the bridge have not been revealed.
I think the biggest question
on our viewers' minds is this...
Why did you blow up
Mapo Bridge?
I built that bridge.
You say, you built Mapo Bridge?
About 30 years ago.
I had to provide for my family,
but didn't have any skills.
So, I just worked odd jobs
in construction.
I did anything for food.
MAPO BRIDGE CONSTRUCTED IN 1983
So, you worked as a worker
in constructing Mapo Bridge in 1983.
Then, two years ago they suddenly
wanted repair work clone.
They said some big-shot,
foreign guests will cross the bridge.
But it didn't look good
because it's too old.
Wait.
A big event 2 years ago?
WORLD LEADERS SUMMIT
You mean
the World Leaders Summit?
They said, if we worked
through the night...
they would pay us $25 more
to get it done fast.
When they're splashing money
saying our country's developed...
I'm still slapping on cement there
after 30 years!
I understand
your disappointment.
I was working on the rail
to get things clone by sunrise.
At the risk of my life!
Suddenly, the rail suddenly
gave way.
Please take your time.
The rail suddenly gave way...
Then, three men
Fell into the water.
I see. 3 workers fell that night
while working.
Then, what happened?
They were alive
and floating in the water.
But cops and rescue forces
were busy with the summit to come!
The 3 men died
while trying to make $25 more.
That's it.
No compensation or apologies.
How can they do that!
Is that why you blew up
Mapo Bridge?
To get attention
and tell this story on air?
I'm PARK No-kyu from Seoul.
Listen to me carefully.
Wait, sir.
Is PARK No-kyu your real name?
I have a name, too.
I also had a family,
and hoped to live well.
So, I worked like a dog
as the country ordered.
But the country thinks of us
as just clogs who died.
Do you understand me?
- Yes, I do. But...
- Then, call someone for me.
The President.
The President?
I just want to be treated
like a human with respect.
Tell him to officially apologize to
the 3 dead workers and family.
I fully understand
how you must feel.
But I think it'll be difficult
for the President to come here.
You said, you'd listen to
whatever I wanted!
I am listening, Mr. PARK.
However, we cannot listen to
excessive demands.
Is that so?
You cursed at me earlier,
can I curse, too?
- You can say anything, but...
- No?
But you swore at me.
Did I?
You must be mistaken.
I'll ask again.
The Mapo Bridge was...
Damn bastard talks too much!
So, go ahead!
You son of a bitch!
We apologize for
that interruption.
Mr. PARK No-kyu?
I'll ask you again.
Hello? Can you hear me?
Damn son of a bitch.
What now?
Why'd you curse!
Come out!
Damn it.
We've lost connection
with the studio.
Put YOON Young-hwa on.
I have a question.
Put him on!
I'm sorry,
we have a bad connection.
Why her?
Please calm down.
He's asking for me!
I'll finish this up!
- The hell...
- You're not yourself.
Stay out of it for now.
Backstabbing me again?
This is mine!
Are we to understand the terror
is against the government?
Then, can you bring the President?
You, rookie!
Don't backstab me!
Hand him over!
We already said
that's not possible.
Really?
I have a few more bombs.
Wait.
Are you saying
there could be more bombings?
I have the switch in hand,
but there's a problem.
What is the problem?
Hello?
Cut!
- Turn to Mapo Bridge!
- Yes, sir!
I'm reporting live from
the Mapo Bridge bombing site.
- Get me a wireless mic instead!
- Yes, sir.
It is the first bridge to collapse
in 19 years...
Chief!
Give me 1 minute!
What are you doing?
I'm warning you!
It's no good messing with the press!
I just want to be heard.
But you're saying crazy things!
Do you think I'm an idiot?
That lady got slightly hurt,
but not you.
Shit! What the hell?
I wouldn't keep cursing at me
if I were you.
Because there's already
a bomb on you.
What? Asshole?
If you get away from the desk,
it'll blow.
If you tell anyone,
it'll blow.
The entire country will see
a big hole in your head.
Who brought me the earpiece?
- Who was it?
- Get ready!
You're on next!
You planted a bomb on me?
Why're you doing this?
Do you know me?
Who doesn't know
YOON Young-hwa?
You became a reporter
for SNC in 2003.
Most trusted and influential
news anchor for 4 years.
The anchor of the nightly news
for over 5 years and...
What's that got to do
with this now?
No one will believe me,
but they trust you.
If you tell him to apologize,
I think he will.
That's what I need now.
The way you talk.
Wait.
That won't bring
the President here.
There's no time!
Wait! Hold on!
How'd the explosion happen?
Is the rookie okay?
Remember your closing commentary?
That's the news for today.
We'll always be just and fair
in delivering news.
This news has to be like that.
Then, it'll end
without any problems.
The hell...
You're on.
Do your job right.
Let's begin.
Don't test my patience.
Wait. Hold on a second.
I'm not ready.
Aren't you starting?
Wait! I need more time!
We're back on!
This is YOON Young-hwa.
There has been a second explosion
at Mapo Bridge.
The explosion was captured
on our camera at the scene.
Let's find out how our staff
is doing out there.
LEE JI-SU IS UNHARMED
Our reporter is...
We'll report on her status
once it comes in.
Bring the President.
Yes, we will try to do
the best we can.
I'll give you 10 minutes.
I believe it'll take more than
10 minutes from the Blue House.
He's at the National Assembly,
probably in hiding.
It's 3 minutes away on foot.
What if he cannot appear?
Then, they die.
Any rescue attempt,
and they'll all die.
But if he apologizes,
I'll turn myself in.
All I need is just an apology.
I see.
If the President is watching
this right now...
A terrorist has the citizens
on Mapo Bridge held captive.
There is no time to waste.
I ask for immediate action.
Call him directly.
02)730-5800
No!
Call him!
We will try calling
the Blue House.
What will you say!
Are you nuts!
Our staff is unable
to make the call.
If we don't call,
the hostages can be at risk.
I will call directly.
The phone is ringing.
REALLY A CONSTRUCTION WORKER?
Hello?
This is YOON Young-hwa.
Hello?
I am still waiting
for them to answer.
I'll keep trying
to reach the Blue House.
I have a question for you.
You said, you worked as a laborer
in construction for 30 years.
I'll ask you again.
Are you really
a construction worker?
Think people who do odd jobs
are stupid?
We look dumb
and can't talk well?
We can think
and get mad, too.
Just didn't know how to
stand up and fight.
But the bombs showed me how.
Still no answer?
I am still calling.
In the meantime,
I have another question.
If what you claim is all true,
the 3 workers should be compensated.
Why do you demand
just the President's apology?
Is there another reason?
Their compensation money of
$2,179,245 was paid in full.
By You.
Secretary KIM Sang-mo of
Blue House National Crisis Management.
This is YOON Young-hwa of SNC.
Are you watching?
Yes, I am.
Are you aware of
the terrorist's demand?
Yes, I am.
There is 5 minutes left.
Where is the President?
Is he in hiding?
You got 1 minute.
For safety reasons,
I cannot disclose that.
The government is very concerned
over the terrorist acts.
So, he is not on his way?
With utmost priority on
our citizen's safety...
Wait.
There's no time for that.
He must come here now.
Is he coming?
We haven't received
notice yet.
However, we are trying our best
to stabilize the situation quickly.
You don't understand, Secretary KIM.
Our citizens' lives are at risk.
Are you insane!
Wrap it up!
If the government doesn't do
anything and casualties arise...
The citizens will not tolerate it.
I trust he is on his way.
Hello? Can you hear me?
Yes. We will do our best.
The boss wants my report.
Just keep it up as usual.
The ratings are at 50%!
That was Secretary KIM Sang-mo
of the National Crisis Management.
I repeat.
The country is engulfed
in fear by terror.
We hope for quick action
from the government.
He'd better come or else.
Yes, Mr. PARK.
I feel the same way.
However, there is not much
time left...
Don't speak, Mr. YOON!
No need to respond to
the terrorist's every word.
I'm Captain PARK Jung-min of
counter-terrorism center.
Mr. PARK?
Could you wait one moment?
We sent Chief CHA out
and turned everything off.
We need to buy some time.
Stay calm and follow my lead.
Ready?
Bring up the hostage footage.
Mr. PARK?
Please look at this footage.
Is the Mapo Bridge
footage ready?
Calmly report on the scene.
Don't excite him by using
the word 'terror' from now on.
As you can see, there are
about 10 citizens stuck on the bridge.
Mr. PARK?
This is your explosion site.
Do you think your cause
will be justified like this?
If I didn't blow up the bridge,
would you have talked to me?
Think if I talk nice,
the President will apologize?
No way.
But it's not the hostages' fault.
Those citizens are the same
as the 3 workers who died.
So?
But you will kill them?
No, I'll save them.
And I'll turn myself in.
Just apologize that the government
treated us wrongfully!
Then, it'll be over.
I know you are tensed.
But viewers are watching.
Stay calm as usual.
Good.
Go back to Mapo Bridge.
Let's turn to the situation
at Mapo Bridge.
We see a car hanging
on the edge of the bridge.
We confirmed there are
3 family members inside the car.
I see.
A man is bringing
two children up to the front.
He appears to be
the two children's father.
He appears to be
the two children's father.
The father is pushing the children
out through the sunroof.
People are actively helping
the two children out.
I pray for the family's safety
and applaud the brave helpers.
We see the two children
being safely rescued out.
Now, the father is trying
to come out after them.
That must've shaken him up, too.
Talk about the victim's family
to draw out sympathy.
Mr. PARK?
From your acts,
those two children lost their father.
You said you had a family, too.
Do you have any children?
If you just saw what happened,
you must have a change in heart.
The President, too.
1 minute left.
Don't look at the clock.
Ask him if he must get
an apology like this.
Must you do this
to get an apology?
There are legal ways
to get what you want.
Legal ways? Like what?
Use legal measures set for those
in need of help like you.
And judiciary measures.
This could be dealt with
by law.
Do you really believe that?
Maybe for rich, smart folks
like you.
But the law has never been
on our side.
I gave this a lot of thought.
But this was
the only choice I had.
But the victims?
What about
the innocent victims?
Please reconsider.
If you give us more time,
we'll get the apology and...
He should've already come.
It's over.
Say he'll be here
in 5 minutes.
Wait! Hold on!
BLACK BULLETPROOF CAR
PULLED IN 2 MINUTES AGO!
He's on his way.
Really?
We confirmed a black vehicle
pulling into our lot.
He will appear momentarily.
At last, PARK No-kyu will get
the apology he demanded.
Preparations to appear
are underway.
The government made
a firm decision in this matter.
He will soon arrive
at our studio.
We thank the President
for coming.
The terror will soon end
with the President's apology.
You've all waited long.
A guest has arrived
in our studio.
This must be
the government's best effort.
I hope Mr. PARK will see
it that way, too.
Commissioner General JOO Jin-chul
has come on behalf of the President.
So, they sent in
a fake apology, huh?
He is the police commissioner
in charge of this case.
I believe a more concrete
apology and...
- May I speak?
- Yes.
I'm Commissioner General
JOO Jin-chul.
The government is seeking ways
to resolve the situation reasonably.
But our priority is in seeing
there are no further casualties.
So?
Surrender.
If you disarm yourself
and turn in...
Get out.
We will take things into
consideration and be generous.
I said, get out!
5 minutes to locating him.
We'll find you.
Make the right choice
when we're giving you the chance.
The police won't be able
to find me.
We'll find you soon.
Then, you know what'll happen.
Looks like your head will be
on a platter not mine.
You came onto put on a show?
Or did someone send you?
Commissioner, please don't talk.
Let Mr. YOON lead.
Commissioner, you frankly said
to surrender.
However, such behavior
may not help the situation.
What if PARK No-kyu
will not surrender and...
Mr. YOON? Stay put.
This is between me
and the terrorist.
Sir! Refrain from speaking!
You stay put, too!
PARK No-kyu!
You think we can't catch you?
We searched through
every record on you we can find.
Born on August 13th, 1959.
PARK No-kyu.
This is you, isn't it?
The government does not negotiate
with terrorists. So, surrender.
I want an apology
not a negotiation!
Commissioner?
See the hostages on the bridge?
You came on
the President's behalf.
Is the government
willing to apologize?
Mr. YOON
Are you out of your mind?
How can the government bow down
to such garbage with people watching?
Wait.
Who're you calling garbage?
I worked to the bone for 30 years,
but I'm garbage?
What about you
who takes bribes and lies!
Calm down, please.
What a laugh from a guy
who was charged for bribery!
That case has been cleared.
They were all mission expenses.
And I'm innocent.
You think people don't know?
They're work related expenses!
Like Mr. YOON here,
everyone does it! Not just me!
I see.
Mr. PARK?
Please understand Commissioner JOO's
heated tone in this matter.
- Back to the topic...
- Look!
Stop being nice to him!
I said, I'm innocent!
But foul thoughts lead to
terrorist acts like this!
I can't stand him.
Tell him to get lost.
You know what happens,
if you don't.
PARK No-kyu!
Don't just think of yourself!
How can you do this!
Ever think
your son is watching this?
What about his young life!
You'll ruin it!
Be quiet!
Please, put that down...
Must you hear his voice
to give up?
I could release his picture,
if I want!
Shut up!
He'll be marked as
a killer's son for life!
He's studying on a government
scholarship!
You should be ashamed!
You call yourself a father?
I cannot stand it, Mr. YOON.
Let's kill him!
After all the chance
I gave you!
Kill him and I'll give you
10 more minutes.
PARK No-kyu!
I swear, I'll catch you
and make you pay!
No! I'm killing you!
Mark my words!
What's this?
BOMB IN EAR
Mr. YOON? What's this?
What's this!
How did you know?
Get this off me.
- What?
- Get this off me.
Who put this on you?
Get this off me.
Get it off me now.
Hold on.
Chief says to go on the air,
if PARK calls back.
Everyone out!
Shit...
That son of a bitch.
Hello?
Hey, are you Okay?
Do the newsflash
until PARK is caught.
I feel like throwing up.
We'd better stop.
Get the camera away.
We are at war here!
See that?
Other stations are going crazy
trying to find PARK.
If you stop here,
our whole station is screwed.
How can you say that
after seeing this?
I know it's hard, but we can't stop
and let someone else have him.
You started it.
So, you finish it.
What!
After they pushed me down
to radio?
You wanna do that for life?
Make a comeback!
Think they'll help you?
Wake up, YOON.
They want the killer,
not a fool who threatens to kill.
To get recognized.
They probably know
where PARK No-kyu is.
They're just dragging this
with no intention to catch him.
What do you mean?
Think the President will come?
Never!
It looks bad if he doesn't apologize
and just catch PARK.
So, why wait?
The kids' father
and JOO Jin-chul dying?
They're too weak.
They want footage of
PARK killing the hostages!
They gotta turn him into
the devil.
Know why?
So, there's no need
to apologize.
I'm part of that ending!
Shit! I'm about to die!
No! No! No!
PARK is just threatening you,
but you hold the key.
If you say there's no apology,
he has nothing. He'll flip!
He'll kill a few hostages.
Then, cops will get PARK.
You wrap things up
and it looks like you caught PARK.
It'll happen like I say.
I get it, but you're saying
we let the hostages die?
You said, this was
your chance of a lifetime!
HOSTAGES MUST DIE TO END?
Be honest.
You made a deal, didn't you?
I make Director,
if we hit 70% in ratings.
Why? You made
a deal with me, too.
It's easy.
If you say there's no apology,
you'll be catching PARK.
But still...
That's the only way.
If things work out,
you'll get a medal of honor.
Chief CHA Dae-eun?
Shit. This is crazy!
You weak fool.
I'm doing this for you...
Hello?
It's PARK Jung-min.
I'll be back soon.
Hurry up
and get this off me.
The dismantling team
is coming.
Did you trace the call?
It's taking longer than
expected.
How long?
- We'll handle things thoroughly...
- How long will it take!
If you reported him sooner,
we would've found him.
We promise to save you.
You're all talk.
What have you done so far?
PARK No-kyu revealed himself
from the start.
You want hell to break lose?
All he wants is an apology!
No, he'll never surrender.
We must catch him.
So, catching him
comes before people's lives?
I get you don't trust cops.
Who do you think will see
you getting killed?
Your family, friends,
or Reporter LEE Ji-su?
The cops don't care about that.
Problem is the whole country
will be seeing it live.
We'll be totally losing
to the terrorist, if you die.
So, how will you catch him?
It'll take about 6 hours
to locate him.
How many times must I ask!
- So, how'll you catch him?
- Calm down.
Look.
The beginning and end
of PARK'S calls.
He called here twice.
We're searching through
the nation's telephone network.
We narrowed it down to
30,000 circuits for the first call.
We'll looking for how many circuits
overlap with the last call.
30,000... Shit.
But we'll find him
no matter what.
He really can't come?
The President?
Excuse me.
What is it?
Okay. Hold on.
We can nail him
with his next call.
I promise you'll get off work
on time today.
The identified victims are
a 39 year-old man...
and Commissioner General
JOO Jin-chul.
No casualties have been found
in the first and second explosions.
There were no injured victims
as well.
Let's look at the falling car
once again.
NO CASUALTIES
HOW?
Hello?
I think I know where PARK is.
What?
He's watching the bridge.
On what basis?
There were no casualties
in the first explosion.
That's not by chance!
There are traffic lights
on Mapo Bridge.
That means he blew it
when there were no cars.
He didn't kill people
on purpose.
But he just did
He just blew the bridge
to get attention.
If he gets the apology,
he won't blow!
I know I'm right!
From the 17 circuits, check near
Mapo Bridge and you'll find PARK.
Hold on.
Hey, YOON!
Just report things
as we talked about.
NO APOLOGY. DECLARE ACTION
AGAINST HIM TO STOP FURTHER THREATS
Are you crazy?
If hostages don't die,
the cops won't move.
You have to read that
to catch him!
I'll send in a press van
to get interviews.
What are you doing!
Are you crazy?
Captain PARK?
Still here?
I know what you're trying to pull.
But this is my turf!
The Commissioner General died
on your watch.
Shouldn't you look for
a new job?
Hold on.
What if PARK kills
all the hostages?
Aren't you folks
waiting for that?
Answer the phone!
- Put him through.
- Hold on.
Do your job.
Read what's written.
This is YOON Young-hwa.
Let's continue the call.
Look at the bridge.
It won't last long like that.
If I get the apology,
I'll let everyone go and surrender.
Don't forget.
The hostages can't be saved.
Just read.
Ignore Chief CHA.
We sent men in
and will locate him soon.
We'll save everyone.
Just buy us some time.
Mr. PARK?
Please, listen carefully.
The person you asked for
is really here in our studio.
And he is ready to apologize.
I'll tell you the apology
in sum.
The government has decided
to accept all your demands.
He'll apologize directly and treat you
fairly to stop any more casualties.
But there is a condition.
What's that?
It's simple.
They need proof that
you'll stop your terrorist acts.
You said, you'd surrender
after the apology.
I know you're nearby.
Please come to the studio.
Come and hear the apology
in person.
I'll give you 3 minutes.
If I stand in front of the camera,
it'll be all over?
That is correct.
It'll end the way you want.
How can I believe that?
What did you say to me at first?
You called because you trust me.
But how can I trust that?
Did you receive money
or something?
Pardon?
Is what they're saying
on the news all true?
Answer clearly.
We have a connection.
Anchor YOON Young-hwa?
You're in a tight situation.
We'd like to be of help.
Would it be okay?
Wait. Who is this?
It's Anchor LEE Sang-jin
of KTN.
We've obtained a reliable tip
on speculations about you.
We received a threatening call
from PARK to verify them with you.
What are you talking about?
May I ask a few questions?
No. No questions, please.
I would like this case
to be resolved quickly, too.
So, please don't ask.
We should resolve this.
What does that
have to do with this?
Are you doing this for ratings?
Here is my first question.
How long were you
the anchor of nightly news?
Answer him.
Please answer the question.
It was for 5 years.
5 years and 2 months
to be exact.
Last month, you suddenly got
forced out of nightly news.
You are now on
a radio program.
That is incorrect.
I resigned on my own.
Let me summarize.
According to our source...
during your 57 months
as the nightly news anchor...
You received contributions.
Correct?
What source?
Please just answer,
'yes' or 'no'.
Let me ask a question.
Who gave you the file
you're looking at?
We cannot disclose that.
It was me.
If you say what we want,
I'll cover for you.
If PARK doesn't get caught,
you will!
Mr. PARK?
The hostages on the bridge
are in great danger.
There is no time.
Let's focus on the issue at hand.
So, you admit you took bribes?
Continue.
Let's continue.
You won the journalist of the year
award last October.
But the exclusive report
you won with...
was revealed to be that of
your wife at the time, LEE Ji-su.
There's no need to listen to
such groundless speculations.
Shit! Cut the dirty crap!
I'll clear things up
with Ji-su.
I'll tell her I ordered you
to steal her story.
If you want to make it big,
you gotta do dirty shit like me.
That's life.
If I were you, I'd read that.
We'll give you the chance
to explain.
Please answer the question.
PRESIDENT'S ON HIS WAY!
Hold on.
Excuse me.
HE'S IN NEXT STUDIO. TOP SECRET.
STALL UNTIL HE MUST APPEAR.
I apologize.
I'll answer.
Anchor LEE Sang-jin?
Stating false rumors as the truth
for ratings is deceiving the viewers.
Think the viewers are stupid?
I'll answer clearly, again.
That is not the truth!
You claim they are all lies.
Then, let me ask you.
Why didn't you report things
when Mapo Bridge first exploded?
Producer JUNG Yong-suk of
'Daily Topic' informed us, directly.
Well...
It seems to me...
an ex-anchor who took bribes
and stole his wife's report...
did not report the terrorist
to get an exclusive.
Any comments on that?
Well...
The ratings just hit 78%.
Let's have drinks some time.
Forget the news anchor deal.
Mr. YOON?
We will assume
you gave us your answer.
We just complied to
the terrorist's demand.
KTN has nothing to do with this.
There is a bomb inside
YOON Young-hwa's ear.
Wait!
Mr. PARK! Wait!
I wouldn't have clone this,
if men like him did the news right.
That's all the news.
Wait! I'll get you the apology!
I swear!
You? You have no right!
He's right in the next room.
Look.
It is hard to see
from my phone...
But the police texted me.
He is in the next room.
So, he will apologize now?
Yes. Right now.
He'll apologize shortly.
LEE JI-SU ON STANDBY
AT MAPO BRIDGE
What the hell is going on!
Chief CHA told us not to tell.
She's there.
BRIDGE PART ABOUT TO SINK
Mr. PARK?
The hostages on Mapo Bridge
are in grave danger.
Our reporter is out
on the scene.
Let's find out
what's happening.
Reporter LEE Ji-su?
Yes. I'm at Mapo Bridge.
Can you tell us
what is happening?
Our camera was damaged
in the second explosion.
I'm reporting
with my cellular phone.
I apologize for
the poor footage.
Currently, there are 16 civilians
trapped on top of Mapo Bridge.
Having watched the newsflash,
the citizens are trembling in fear.
Some are suffering from burns...
People with severe burns
are in urgent need of treatment.
Reporter LEE Ji-su.
Are you okay?
The bridge plate we are on
is tilted 15° due to the explosion.
It appears to be so
on screen.
The slant is getting worse
with time.
There is no telling
how long we will last.
There are rescue helicopters
flying overhead.
But no rescue can be made
without the terrorist's consent.
I see.
Reporter LEE Ji-su?
Yes?
Nothing...
Please stay still and safe
until this ordeal is over.
It'll be fine.
I hope you will finish
the news safely, too.
Thank you.
Mr. PARK?
The hostages on the bridge
are in great danger.
- Please let women and children...
- Don't change the subject!
No apology, they all die.
As I mentioned,
the President will apologize.
But if the civilians die,
it will be over!
No apology!
They have nothing
to do with this!
Not really.
Isn't the lady reporter
important to you?
We've located him!
Like you said,
he was watching the bridge.
Our men are headed there...
Wait! Then, he's not coming?
- Arresting PARK comes first.
- But the hostages?
Give us 5 more minutes.
Enough with more minutes!
You said, he was coming!
An apology doesn't guarantee
the hostages' safety.
YOON Young-hwa!
Yes, I'm talking with
the police.
He'll be here soon.
Why can't he come
and apologize?
You said he'd come!
Damn it!
Mr. PARK?
What are you doing?
Clear the helicopters!
Think you can play games?
I'll bring him.
Still not coming?
Are you watching?
You hear me well, don't you?
You're killing those people!
Watch carefully.
Wait! Mr. PARK! Please!
The President must still
be getting ready to appear.
We are all in this difficult situation
along with you.
Shut up and close your eyes.
Where'd the cop go?
She said she'd bring him!
Go check! Hurry!
The entire country is watching.
Mr. PARK.
Appealing to the public
can get you the apology.
For that, you must release
some hostages.
I'll stay.
But I beg you to let the women
and children be rescued.
Fine.
Women and children only.
Hurry!
PARK No-kyu agreed to release
some of the hostages.
Now, it's the government's turn
to show action in response.
I ask the President
in the next studio.
There is no time.
Please come at once
and apologize.
I repeat.
PARK released some hostages.
As you can see, a helicopter
is approaching for the rescue.
Just now...
I ask all rescue forces
on the water...
Please promptly start searching
at the crash site.
Please...
There must be survivors.
I trust everyone can be rescued.
Please hurry.
Once again, I ask all rescue forces
to start searching for survivors.
Mr. PARK?
What do you say to this?
Cut the sh...stuff about apologies
and say something.
I'm sorry.
You were going to kill them
anyway!
Son of a...
You're sorry?
How can you say that!
I started this
just to hear those two words.
I said to come quick
because it'll collapse.
I agreed to the rescue!
But where is he?
It's out of my hands now.
I'm watching you.
Can you hear me?
I'm at the scene.
We're going to catch PARK.
Good work.
If I hear anything on LEE Ji-su,
I'll let you know. Don't hang up.
It's all over now.
HOSTAGES MUST DIE TO END?
POLICE LOCATED TERRORIST
The terrorist is
about to be shot down.
There is no threat of
additional bombings.
YOON Young-hwa?
It's not over for us.
Cameras are here to film me
getting caught.
But I have
another announcement.
I'm going to blow up
this building.
Wait! Hold on!
I inform the police!
Stop your arrest!
There is another bomb.
Stop the arrest!
Hello?
Can you hear me?
You must stop the arrest
at once!
Come out of the building now!
I repeat!
Stop the arrest at once!
Evacuate the building!
TERRORIST TO BE GUNNED DOWN
All lines are busy.
MOST HOSTAGES RESCUED
SURVIVORS BEING IDENTIFIED
JR TOWER COLLAPSES
ONTO SNC BUILDING
Hello?
It's Secretary KIM Sang-mo.
Are you alright?
Yes, I'm fine.
I was very worried.
The rescue team
will arrive shortly.
Did you call the press
or anyone?
No.
You didn't talk to anyone else?
No, I didn't.
There's no time,
so I'll be brief.
You'll soon be summoned
by the prosecution.
Me? Why?
We have no choice.
Your bribes were made public.
Just read the confession
we prepared for you.
Wait! What confession?
What are you saying?
Still don't get it?
The terror is over.
Then, what's the problem?
The public will protest and say
it was excessive use of force.
With PARK No-kyu dead,
we can't get around it.
There's no footage of him
sobbing in remorse.
Someone has to take the bullet.
Hold on.
So, you and Chief CHA
let my story leak?
The President won't apologize,
so dump everything on me?
Secretary KIM.
After everything I did!
How can you do this!
Still, you took the money.
You gave it to me! Damn it!
You're a lot dumber
than you look.
Why didn't you just do
what Chief CHA told you to?
Saying on TV to apologize
and shit. The nerve!
I recorded everything.
I'll spill it everywhere!
Look, YOON.
Think anyone will believe
you now?
YOON Young-hwa can
fabricate the evidence...
Or go on the run.
Thus, he'll soon be detained
for questioning.
The police are searching
for clues to locate the terrorist.
But no leads
have yet been found.
You're smart.
So, I'll ask one question.
If I get caught,
how long will I have?
I'll be executed.
It doesn't matter
if I get caught or killed.
But I can't end things
like this.
WAREHOUSE
Mr. PARK?
I can get back on the news.
Let's get the President's apology.
I'll help you.
Think he'll apologize?
No way!
If I press a switch,
the building will fall over.
Mr. PARK...
What do you want me to do?
Then, why don't you
just come here and speak?
If you knew he won't,
why'd you call?
What power do I have?
It's not my fault
the President won't apologize.
Tell me!
Why me?
Still, I thought
you'd be different.
You're all the same.
That's why you're dying.
Then, I'll stand there
and end things myself.
Please, Mr. PARK...
Please...
Please don't kill me!
Please, sir!
Please! I beg you! Please!
Let me live?
Let me out, please?
Keep being like that.
Groveling under damn bastards.
Live like that, then die.
I'll give you 5 minutes.
Scram.
What?
Your bomb is a fake.
What?
This news just in.
The terrorist identified as
PARK No-kyu was...
one of the workers who died during
the bridge's repairs 2 years ago.
Born on August 13th, 1959.
PARK No-kyu. This is you, isn't it?
I'm PARK No-kyu from Seoul.
I'm PARK No-kyu from Seoul.
I also had a family.
And hoped to live well.
Then, I'll stand there
and end things myself.
Police have no clue
on the terrorist's identity.
They are searching for clues
inside the terrorist's home.
The police claim the terrorist
is skilled in engineering.
The investigation
could take weeks.
The two buildings look like
they could collapse any minute.
Everyone has been
safely evacuated out of SNC.
But there is no word
on YOON's whereabouts.
This is YOON Young-hwa.
There is a bomb rigged here
and it is about to explode.
However, I am here
to finish this newsflash.
Today, a man terrorized Seoul
demanding the President's apology.
Though illegal, I thought he had
reason to get the apology.
But I just changed my mind.
Here is a newsflash.
The terrorist pretending to be
PARK No-kyu will reveal himself here.
No matter who he is,
I'm going to catch and kill him.
Please watch this news
until the end.
Who the hell are you!
PARK No-kyu
PARK Shin-woo
Who are you?
Are you PARK No-kyu's son?
Why'd you do it?
You didn't trust me
from the bat!
Why'd you do this to me!
My Father...
He only watched your news.
When I asked why...
He said, you could be trusted.
The fool...
He worked like a dog
his whole life, then died.
So, I wanted an apology
in his name.
Is it that hard to apologize?
Now...
This is all I have.
The terrorist is in
Studio B on the 31st floor.
Grab it!
Grab my hand!
I understand!
So, grab my hand!
Those bastards won't even twitch,
if you die like this!
Nothing will change!
Do what you set out to do!
Wanna die like your father!
Grab it!
I'm sorry!
The hell with them.
I'll apologize instead.
I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry.
TERRORIST GUNNED DOWN
I repeat.
Kill him upon sighting.
It was appalling.
However, as the President...
I made a firm choice to guard
the nation's freedom and justice.
The government will not
negotiate with terrorists...
REPORTER LEE JI-SU FOUND DEAD
Our forces took prompt
and firm action.
As a result,
the terrorist paid the price.
The terrorist's claims
were nothing but lies.
Beloved citizens...
I thank you for supporting
my decision in this matter.
Today, the government won
the war against terrorists.
