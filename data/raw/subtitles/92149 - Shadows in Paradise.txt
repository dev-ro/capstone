SHADOWS IN PARADISE
Friday!
Take it.
- I'm driving.
Listen, Nikander.
We've been a team for quite a while.
But I've been doing this
for 25 years.
I'm getting tired,
and so's the old heart.
What's the matter?
- Never mind.
I've got an idea - my own company.
Five trucks to start with...
Where does it end?
- The sky's the limit.
The state and the banks
will back us.
I know everything about this game -
but I'm not going to die
behind the wheel.
Where, then?
- Behind a desk.
And I need a good foreman.
32.70.
You're bleeding!
Yes, I hurt my hand.
- We'll put a plaster on it.
Coming out tonight?
Where?
Somewhere with some fun.
- Yea.
How was the weekend?
- Great! I had a hell of a time!
Have you thought about it?
Everything's ready.
The bank's with us
and we've got a garage.
Maybe I should go on a course.
- Fine! Do whatever you think.
I promised my wife way back -
that with me, she would
get to see the world...
...it's about time.
- I can be a driver, too.
Or whatever,
if you think I can manage.
Sure you can!
I've got a slogan already:
"Reliable Garbage Disposal
since 1986."
But that's now!
- That's why it catches the eye!
Pretty smart!
- Isn't it.
Who can put out the flame
Once it starts to blaze
Underneath the hot, hot sun
On Life's highway you can see
Many pretty will-o'-the-wisps
But there's only one I truly miss...
Another one.
- No more!
No?
Good morning.
Dammit! My neck's stiff.
What happened?
- I'm not at work!
Where are we?
The door's locked.
- It usually is, in jail.
I'll lose my job.
Do you come here often?
- No, never.
You're OK then.
I don't have a job at all.
You don't?
Why?
- Why do you think?
We got a spare job yesterday.
Maybe you could get it.
What's your job?
- Garbage truck driver.
OK. Melartin.
- Nikander.
See you in the morning.
Make it at six tomorrow morning.
You'll have to do a week's trial.
Bloody great.
Now I've just got to call the wife.
Tell her you got a job.
- Won't help.
She'll hit me anyway.
- Why drink then?
It makes me feel good.
Things seem to be fine.
They do?
- Yea. How about another?
No.
- Why not? I'll call her after it.
If it helps.
- Lf you've got a problem...
Who, me? Who says so?
- Nobody.
Of course not.
Hello.
- Hi.
I've been wondering
who takes that away.
It's only me.
Is your hand better?
- Yes, it's fine now.
Will you come out with me tomorrow?
I'm working till eight.
- That's OK.
Alright then.
I'll be here at eight. Good night.
What are those for?
- My brother's leaving school today.
But you don't have a brother!
I've got a weird migraine: Gotta go.
What's the rush? Let's have a drink.
I'm in a hurry.
Hi.
Come on in.
What's the matter with you?
- Why?
You look nervous.
- Bullshit!
Don't you eat around this time?
- Not today, the wife's out.
Then you're in no hurry home.
- None at all. How about a beer?
No way.
- Why?
Doctor's orders!
A barefaced lie! Admirable!
See you.
- Bye.
Evening.
Evening.
Where shall we go?
You choose.
Bertha one.
Ivan twenty-seven.
Ivan nineteen.
Hey!
- Yes?
Wait!
I don't think it'll work out.
- What won't?
Anything.
Morning. How was it?
- What!?
104.95.
You're wanted downstairs.
No one can predict how
the market forces change.
Sometimes you have too much staff,
sometimes too little.
But I'd have liked to keep
you here with us. - Sure!
But there's nothing
I can do about it.
I just sit here and watch
the sales graph...
There must be a new supermarket
around here with all their -
special offers and so on... So our
sales will go down temporarily.
I'm afraid you'll have to go.
The supermarket's
a merciless machine.
Your daughter finishes school
in two weeks.
She needs a job.
You don't fool me.
You can stay the two weeks.
And the flat?
- Two weeks. That's all.
I think I'll leave now.
- Then you lose two weeks' salary.
Thanks a lot.
That guy is crazy.
- What do you mean?
I got fired.
- You did?
Yes.
- Why?
Just because.
Oh shit.
Hi.
- Well, hi!
Let's go.
- Where?
For a drive, out of town.
- What, now?
OK. But I must see a friend first.
- Why?
That's my business.
- Let's go then.
Hi.
Lend me some money -
and a clean shirt, will you?
- OK.
Give me 500.
- I haven't got it.
You just got paid yesterday!
- I paid the food bill.
Damn you.
Find a clean shirt, will you?
Good evening.
We saw the vacancy sign.
- One double, is it?
No, two singles.
- Please fill these in.
Are you coming in?
Now what... Nikander?
I don't know.
Are you hungry?
- Yes.
Let's go to a restaurant and eat.
I must change then.
- OK. Change.
I'll see you in the corridor.
Not bad, is it?
- It's fine.
Do you find it dull here?
With me, I mean.
- Why?
Just asking.
Take it easy.
Everything's OK tonight.
I don't know about tomorrow, though.
Maybe the weather will turn,
or something.
What do you want from me anyway?
Who me?
- Yes, you.
More wine?
- Answer me!
I don't want anything from anybody!
I'm Nikander.
Ex-butcher,
now a garbage truck driver!
Bad teeth and stomach,
liver hanging on!
More than I can say about my head!
No use asking what I want.
I only asked.
- You're welcome.
It's cold here.
- Really? I hadn't noticed.
Good night.
Thanks for the evening.
Come in.
Breakfast.
What's that?
Supermarket's cashbox,
but it's locked.
Show me. Is there money in it?
Yes. How much? - How should I know?
I can't get it open.
Wait, don't do a thing.
All you ever gave me
Was sorrow and pain
But that's alright,
I can hide my ache.
I won't let people know
For if you leave me now
My heart will cry
But it mustn't show.
What shall I do with the money?
There's too much of it,
you'll have to give it back.
It was revenge.
It's the third job
I've been thrown out of this year.
I wanted to go to Florida
but I missed the plane.
Anyway, I couldn't get the box open.
My aunt's been to Florida -
all she saw was some Finns
and Donald Ducks.
They must know I took it.
- I'll take care of that.
That would be great.
Do you know what you're doing?
- Of course.
Ilona Rajamaki?
If you didn't take the money
why won't you tell us -
where you've been since you
left work on Saturday?
It's none of your business,
that's why.
You haven't been to your flat,
we have witnesses.
Witnesses?
- Your ex-workmates.
When you were fired
you left right away.
You were very upset.
A cash-box disappeared.
Sounds bad, doesn't it?
- That depends.
You're the only suspect.
Shall I go through
the questions again?
Don't bother. I...
Yes?
What do you want me to say?
- Don't say anything.
Say that I went back
where I came from.
I thought you were a local.
- No.
Where're you from, then?
- Down the street.
I'll say you just took off.
- Fine.
See you.
How much for a single?
- 300 marks, with breakfast.
And without?
- The same.
I'll take it.
- No way.
Why?
- We're full.
Why didn't you say so?
Is Ilona there?
- No.
She should be!
- Yes, but she left.
Where?
- She didn't say.
I see.
So long.
We're closing.
I must go to work.
I'll stay here and sleep.
Here are some sheets and a towel.
Right.
I must go.
It's beautiful.
- What is?
The sun, the sea and the birds.
- Gimme a light.
Remember that chick
from the supermarket?
Guess where she is now?
- No.
Sleeping in my bed.
- Get back there, then!
I can't.
- What's keeping you?
Horror, fear and this work shift.
I'll take care of things.
- Thanks.
Haven't you learned to knock?
- This is my flat.
What's your first name?
- I'm not telling.
Something wrong with it?
- Might be.
Come here.
You've just got yourself a job.
Our employees have to be punctual.
My secretary
will show you your duties.
I hope we'll work together well.
Evening.
- Good evening. Will you be dining?
Yes.
Unfortunately
the restaurant is full.
Is it good?
- It's alright.
Want to go home?
- Why not.
You can try it on over there.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
- I came to see where you're working.
Nice-looking place.
How about a coffee?
I'm busy, see you this evening.
Who was he?
- Who?
The shit-collector.
- He's only my cousin.
Please arrange to meet him
somewhere else.
I think I'll take a walk.
- I'll just finish doing these.
I'd rather go alone.
Lend me some cheese.
When will you pay me back?
I'll get liver pate tomorrow.
Go ahead.
- Thanks.
Mother-in-law's babysitting tonight.
- Really?
We could go out,
the four of us. - Where?
The classic thing:
Movie first, then a bar. Get drunk.
Ilona won't come.
- Tell her she must!
I'll order her to come!
She seems to be late.
- Sure does.
I'll wait for her.
- Take your tickets.
We gotta go now.
Can you make it home?
- I always make it home.
Good night.
- Good night.
Well?
- What?
Let's have it.
- What?
I didn't turn up yesterday.
And not later, either.
- I noticed.
Is that all you have to say?
- Yes.
Pig!
That's pretty weak.
- Isn't it?
If you've got a bad conscience,
I can't help.
Why should I have?
- How should I know?
Maybe you just got lost, maybe not!
I'll go in the morning.
- Why?
Don't you like it here?
- It's not that.
Alright - but why wait till morning?
Are you sick?
- Yes, mentally.
But we've still gotta
collect the shit. - No way.
I'll make you some coffee.
Bring me booze!
You'll get fired without
a doctor's certificate.
The kind of doctor I need hasn't
been born yet. - Are you coming?
Are you still seeing that dustman?
- No.
He was a bit ugly, anyway.
- What do you mean?
He wasn't.
- Really ugly.
But nice. Maybe a bit strange.
At least he wasn't
as dumb as your men.
They can't even chew gum
and walk at the same time.
But Nikander can?
A lot of other things, too.
But it's too late now.
Three sixes.
Why do I keep losing?
You've got no desire to win.
- So what?
You've got a kid.
- That's right.
How does it feel?
- It's OK.
Want me to smash you face in?
- Who, you?
No.
- That's what I thought.
Why?
- Why not?
Want to buy a video recorder?
- I've got one.
I can sell you one.
I don't need another one!
- For your kitchen.
My wife's in there,
with the washing machine.
She could watch it
while she's cooking.
Are you out of your mind or
something? - I don't think so.
Want to go out for a beer tonight?
Can't, the wife's going.
- They always do.
Three twos.
I was pretty well
through with the subject.
I'd probably considered it
from most of its various angles -
including the one that certain
injuries or imperfections are -
a subject of merriment
while remaining quite serious -
with the person possessing them.
It's funny. It's very funny.
And it's a lot of fun,
too, to be in love.
Do you think so?
It's funny. It's very funny.
And it's a lot...
Hello.
- Hi.
I was just passing by.
- Yes?
How are you, old man?
- Alright.
Want me to smash your face in?
No.
- Get lost then, we've got to talk.
I'll wait in the car.
I'm sorry.
- You've become violent.
True. Are you busy?
- A little.
I bet you are.
I'm going to see my sister.
She was studying in Stockholm -
now she's in a mental hospital.
Want to come with me?
I don't think so.
I've been so lonely.
Want to go back inside?
Yes.
You're very quiet.
We tried to come here once,
but couldn't get in.
Why didn't you call the manager?
- What, us?
I think I'll go.
- Why?
I feel like going.
Let's go to my place -
you haven't been there yet.
Thanks for the evening.
Staffan, look at that.
What's up?
You got a cigarette, friend?
Hello.
What's the matter?
Hello. It's nothing.
Let's have a smoke.
When will they let you out?
- I don't know.
They want to do
some more tests on me.
How're things at work?
OK. Mikkonen busted
his truck yesterday.
We had to do his round, too.
- Overtime, right?
Right. 120 marks an hour.
Have you called Ilona?
- No.
Why not?
- Good question.
Did you come by car?
- Yes.
I'll get my clothes.
I've come to take you away.
- Where?
For a honeymoon. Life's too
hard for you alone. - You think so?
Maybe you're right.
- Of course. Shall we go?
But my job...
- We'll get you a new one later.
What do you think? - Looks good.
Pay at the cashier.
Do you want to buy something?
Who's he?
- I don't know.
If you're not buying anything I...
- Get lost.
You heard him.
Don't try it!
Can we live on your money?
Alright then - where are we going?
They have these cruises to Tallinn.
I'll get my coat.
Look up, my little friend
See, the park is brightly lit.
My poor heart longs for you
It's beating here all alone.
So hurry, please, oh, hurry home
Man's life is oh so short.
Hurry to me, my love, my own
You give me everything.
Hurry, please, hurry to me
Everything here is yours.
But my friend, although I ask
I know it's all in vain.
Even though I long for you
Day and night, don't run to me.
Don't, because you know it too
Life would only bring us pain.
Don't hurry now back to me
The shadows here
would swallow you.
Hurry not, see the beautiful world
Because here
you wouldn't see for tears.
