- So?
Well, if you give me eleven pence,
I'd have a shilling.
You're not soft, are you?
Mam!
Oh, go on, Mam.
Our Titch said she'd take me.
Oh, go on, Mam.
Hey, Bud, get me those nets
out of the lads' bedroom, will you?
OK, Mam.
Pass me a few bricks, will ya?
Oh, come on, lad, where's those nets?
I wanna wash them.

If you were the only girl in the world
# And I was the only boy
# Nothing else would matter
# In this world today
# We would go on loving
# In the same old way
# A Garden of Eden just meant for two
# With nothing to mar our joy
I would say
Such wonderful things to you
There would be
Such wonderful things to do
# If you were the only girl in the world
# And I was the only boy
Go on, get my purse.
Oh thanks, Mam!

Oh, no, we've got that little tree of our own.
Have we got we've got the tree?

"Costing No Less Than Heaven'
Come on, you four, make a shape!
It's well past seven.
Jesus tonight, it's cold!
Hey, Bud, will you do my back for me?
Youp, won't you, lad?
Go on, get washed and I'll bring you your tea and toast.
OK, Mam.
You're late.
Report to Mr Bunshell, the Headmaster.
Then go upstairs to the nurse
in Room 10.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Why have you come?
Mr Nicholls told me to report late, sir.
Hmm.
Come on.
In future, be puctual.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Lice.
Lice.
Clean
Lice.
Lice.

Christ, that's cold.
OK, you can rise it out now, Bud.
Cor blimey, it's scalding!
Oh, you little sadist!
Can we go to the second house, Titch?
Oh, give us a chance, will you?
I haven't even looked at The Echo yet.
- Anyway what's on?
- Can we go and see Young at Heart?
It's on at The Forum.
Oh, I suppose so.
Oh, thanks, Titch.
Go to Tara's and get some sweets.
- What sort?
- Er.. mis-shapes.
Go on, the money's in my coat.
Are you ready?
- Yeah.
Well, get your coat on.
We don't wanna miss the beginning, do we?
Oh, hey, Mam!
- Keep still!
- Oh, Titch!
Oh, it stinks!
- Would you prefer having nits?
- No!
Then you'll have to put up with the stink,
won't you?
There you are. All done.
Right, next.
- Where's Albie?
MOTHER. All right, Edna?
Oh, I'm dead chocka.
Cook, wash, clean - that's all I do.
I never go anywhere.
I'm like the bleedin' Prisoner of Zenda!
Look at them hands. Putrid.
Hey, Mam, it's my dad.
Tell him his tea's in the oven
and I'll be in a minute.
Little Billy isn't half going like you, isn't he?
I know, poor little swine. you could chop wood
with my face, couldn't you?
Cor blimey, what nature has in store for us!
- Hello, girl.
- See what I mean?
Still on the electric, Curly?
No, I spewed it.
- Why?
- He didn't like the fella, did he?
How are you managing?
- Doing fine, Lize.
- Thank Christ.
- Or we'd all be eating bleedin' fuse wire.
- He's full of rhythm, though, isn't he?
Yeah, like Saint Vitus.
You must realize
I don't even know who Saint Vitus is.
Don't start doing
those stupid bleedin' impressions!
He does them good, though, doesn't he?
Cor blimey, Helen, don't encourage him.
If he thinks he has an audience,
he'll do it more. I'm tormented enough.
Now, listen to me, kid. Nobody torments you,
but I will. I'm Little Caesar.
Who's that supposed to be?
Edward G Robinson!
Sounds more like bleedin' Cardew Robinson!
He does it just to annoy me.
It doesn't half get on my nerves.
Come on, girl, where's my scoff?
In the oven. Steak and onions.
- I had that last week!
- If you're not careful, I'll hit you with it!
Isn't it bleedin' lively turning his nose up
at steak and onions?
Some poor bastards never get it.
Tomorrow night, it'll be dog food.
Sounds "ruff".
See, what I've gotta put
up with?
I should never have got married.
What the bleedin' hell did I ever see in you?
Mam!
- What?
- I'm hungry!
Oh, eat someone!
I'll swing for these kids one of these days.
Come on, soft ollies, we'd better go.
Have you heard the latest?
They're burying Catholics in Protestant
cemeteries now. They're dead, like.
The next bus'll be along in a few minutes.
Be under it.
See you, then.
- Ta-ra, Curly.
- Ta-ra.
- You need to shave.
- So do you.
Ha, ha, ha! Stop messing!

# Yes, we'll walk up the avenue
# Yes, we'll walk up the avenue till we're there
You're always saying I never take you

Are you going to Cast Iron Shore, Kev?
No, Woolton Woods.
Can I go with you?
you haven't got a bike, Bud, lad.
Will you bring me some pears back, then?
Yeah.
Can I have a bit of your drink, Kev?
you won't like it.
Oh, it's horrible!
I told you wouldn't like it!
- Watch the car.
- Look both ways, Jean.
Can't I come with you?
Oh, go on, let me.

But I have a fancy
I should like to see someone play.

BUD. What did you get for Christmas, Albie?
- A cowey outfit and a Bren gun.
BUD. Ought me a watch.
Some of those stars are dead.
The light in them started out
when Jesus was alive.
ALBIE. How do you know?
- Our teacher said.
# No star is o'er the lake
# Its pale watch keeping
# The moon is half awake
# Through grey mists creeping
# The last red leaves fall
# Round the porch of roses
# The clock hath ceased to sound
# The long day closes
# Sit by the silent hearth
# In calm endeavour
# To count the sounds of mirth
# Now dumb forever
# Heed not how hope believes
# And fate disposes
# Shadow is round the eaves
# The long day closes
# The lighted windows..
# The lighted windows dim
# Are fading slowly
# The fire that was so trim
# Now quivers lowly
# Quivers lowly
# Go to the dreamless bed
# Where grief reposes
# Thy book of toil is read
# The long day closes
# Go to the dreamless bed
# Where grief reposes
# Thy book of toil is read
# Thy book of toil is read
# Go to the dreamless bed
# The long day closes
