The Supergas Petroleum Enhancer
15 January
Experiment #573, Group 6
What's up?
The Supergas! It works!
Supergas?
It works!
It's a revolution in renewable energy
A VC firm
will invest on Wednesday
But first I'm leaving for Thailand
All I need is Zhou's power of attorney,
and we're all set
Xu Lang,
we've been together for 12 years
I ask you for a divorce,
and you only think of your company!
This marriage
means nothing to you, does it?
You know what this project means to me
Your daughter Xiao Di had an accident
What happened to her?!
She fought with Dandan, just to prove
that she'd been to Ocean Park
Dandan shoved her hard
She fell, and cracked her head open
How could this happen?
I promised
I'd take her to Ocean Park
You've made that promise seven times
She's been waiting this whole time
I can't sign the divorce papers today
Or I'm going to miss my flight
I can't sign them today, really
And I'm not going to explain again
I've spent four years working on this
The project is everything I have!
We'll talk when I get back
I only want Xiao Di
Do I have to kneel down and beg?
The last time you knelt down to me
was when you proposed
It's funny
Oh my!
Xu, what are you doing?
Get out!
Are you proposing to your wife again?
Aren't you honeymooning in Paris?
What are you doing here?
Did you hear anything from Mr. Zhou?
No, I didn't
I heard you've a deal with a VC company
No
Then where are you going?
Hong Kong. What?
What for?
Has Mr. Zhou contacted you?
No, not a word
Do you know where he is?
No. I thought that you knew
No. How did you know I knew?
I didn't know you know!
Enjoy your mano-o-mano. I'm leaving
Let go of me!
Didn't you say you're off to Thailand?
No, I didn't
I'll say it again,
all I want is Xiao Di
Let go of me!
Take care!
So you're going to Thailand?
You believe the lies I told my wife?
Our Mr. Zhou is in Thailand
Your wife's pregnant and alone in Paris
How can you not be worrying about her?
Why were you arguing? Who was cheating?
We're married. Begging is normal
I think your stiff neck is returning
Yeah? Isn't your tooth hurting again?
Your teeth are hurting me!
Your phone is charged
Here's the Thai baht
You're on Little Red Riding Hood Tours
Gao Bo left his honeymoon early
It means he closed a deal in France
Yes, sir
We're ruined if he finds Zhou first
Yes, sir!
Call me if he does anything suspicious
Yes, sir!
When is the flight exactly?
In two hours
Any news from the hacker?
He said Zhou is in Chiang Mai
I know Chiang Mai well. Where exactly?
Somewhere in Chiang Mai
Somewhere?
He's meditating
at one of the temples
At one of the temples?
Yes, at one of the temples
There are thousands of temples there!
The hacker said he'd keep hacking
You want me on a wild goose chase?
No!
I'll send you the map soon!
If you can't locate him
within a mile,
at which temple on which mountain today,
you'll never work in this business again
Yes, sir!
Mr. Xu, how's your tooth?
Map to the big phone, calls to the other
Yes, sir
Listen, Xiao Di?
We'll go to Ocean Park
in a few days
I don't believe you!
Sweetie, daddy's sorry. Really
Liar!
I mean it this time
The other girls said I don't have a dad!
Who said you don't have a father?
Hello?
Lili!
Yeah. Hi
I'm waiting for the map.
Where is it?
Guess!
Listen to me!
If I arrive in Thailand without a map,
what am I gonna do in Chiang Mai's areas?
Ladyboys!
What else would you do?
No worries! I'll bring one back for you!
I have to go now. Send the map ASAP!
You bet I will! Okay, bye bye!
Whoah!
What a huge screen!
Ouch!
Sorry
Sorry, sorry...
Hello?
You have the address?
Send it right now
Hey, we're taking off
The phone will interfere with the plane
What if we crash?
Turn it off
I know! You don't have to tell me that
Then turn it off!
How can I help you, sir?
His phone is still turned on!
What are you doing?
Your phone is still on
You know it's dangerous to keep it on
Sir.
Please power off your phone now
Yes, I will. Just one more second
Sir, please turn off your phone now
She doesn't buy it!
Think about all these people's lives
Come on, turn it off
Otherwise the plane won't take off
Thank you for your cooperation
It's okay
The first time I flew, I didn't know
I fly all the time
So what do you do?
I make spring onion pancakes!
I'm Bao's Pancake Chronicles on Weibo!
Let's friend each other on Weibo
I turned off my phone!
It's okay. We can do it when we land
This is the immigration form
Please fill it in
Immigration form
Please fill it in
Hey, what's your name?
What do you want?
Can you tell me what this says?
What should I write here?
Give me your passport
Thank you!
Why is everything
in plastic bags?
My mom says it rains a lot in Thailand,
so you have to waterproof everything!
Wang Bag?
You can call me Baobao
The purpose of your trip to Thailand?
Well, look, this is my bucket list!
First I want to see the Taj Mahal...
Whoah! Hold on!
The Taj Mahal is in India!
Oh, okay, we'll scratch that one then
Get a massage, ride an elephant...
Go swimming, worship Buddha...
And I'm gonna fight a Thai kickboxer!
And I'll plant my Good Health Tree
Okay, we don't have to list everything
Just 'travel' is fine
I'm gonna see a ladyboy show too!
Look! Ladyboys!
Is she a ladyboy too?
No. That's my girlfriend
She's your girlfriend?
Yeah
But she's the movie star Fan Bingbing!
Yeah! Fan Bingbing is my girlfriend
Fan Bingbing is your girlfriend?
Yeah!
You cut this out of a magazine
No, I didn't
I cut it from a newspaper
Something's wrong with your medication
How did you know it was time?!
How can I help you, sir?
Can I have some water?
Yes, sir. I'll be right back
"Lost In Thailand"
Lili!
I just arrived in Bangkok
I couldn't download the map yet
Send it again, alright?
Hang on!
I think my phone has a virus!
Hey, can you take a picture of me?
Hold on!
Hey! Take a picture of me!
Okay, okay. Here
Thanks!
Can you hold onto
my Good Health Tree?
Thanks!
Hey...
I have a weak phone signal.
Emaï¬‚me
Tour guide! Tour guide!
Are there earlier flights to Chiang Mai?
You aren't coming with us?
No, I have an emergency
Hold on, I'll check for you
Don Mueang Airport has a flight
But hurry,
the flight leaves in an hour
Okay, I understand
There are just two airports in Bangkok?
Yes. And I can't refund your booking!
That's fine
Hey!
Hey!
Sorry to
keep you waiting so long
Where the hell have you been?
Hey, listen up
I spied a spy in the bathroom!
You're insane!
Seriously, he was talking on his phone
about implanting a global positioning tracker
Hey. are you okay?
What are you doing?
Aren't you coming with us?
Bye!
Bye!
Wang Bag!
Hurry!
You can call me Baobao
Wang Bao,
I'm heading to Chiang Mai on business
It was a chance encounter
But it was a pleasure meeting you
One day I'll try
your spring onion pancakes
Yeah
You have to promise me!
Yeah
Why don't you write down my number?
It's fine. I'll be in touch in Beijing
But how if you don't know my number?
Let me tell you now
Okay, go ahead
Write it down...
Don't worry, I have a good memory
I can remember it. Just say it
137970767017
Can you repeat it back to me?
No problem. I have it memorized. Bye
Remember to
send me your number too
Enjoy your life with Fan Bingbing!
Hey!
I'm very sorry
I lied to you
The truth is...
Fan Bingbing isn't my girlfriend yet
Understood.
Have a good trip! Bye!
But my mom likes Fan Bingbing
Bye!
She's a huge fan of Fan!
Bye!
Go that way. Be quick!
No, no, no...
(Thai) Relax
No police, no camera!
(Thai) Really, just be calm...
Use the loudspeaker!
No, no, no, no...
(Thai) Gentlemen don't honk their horns
(Thai) Relax
I'm in a rush, no time to relax!
(Japanese) Calm down...
Now you're speaking Japanese
I'm not Japanese. I'm Chinese
Chinese people are always in a hurry
Thai people are always lazy
Whereabouts in China?
Beijing
Bemng?
Your traffic is even worse!
This is Thailand
(Thai) Relax...
Please!
Sorry, no ticketing without a passport
Tell me the fastest way to Chiang Mai?
By train, tomorrow morning, have one
By train without a passport is okay?
Yes, sir
And hotel?
No...
Okay
Did you forget something!?
You can't find it, can you?
Well, I got it!
I was wondering,
why your phone was in my pocket
How did you find me!
The tour leader said you're here, so...
I almost lost you. Here's your phone
I don't want it.
Take it. A gift. Go!
No. Mom said don't take from strangers
Didn't she teach you obedience?
My mom told me to be kind
and to always do the right thing
Oh, you are really unbelievable!
Are you being sarcastic?
No. That was a compliment
Then could you lend me some money?
Are you completely brain dead?!
How did you know that?
It was just this morning, after I left,
that I realized I'd forgotten my wallet
And I took a taxi just now to find you
The driver's still waiting for the fare
I promise I'll pay you back later
That's enough. Thank you!
Hey. Wang Bao!
Do you have your passport?
Yes, I do. Do you?
I'm sorry, Wang Bao
I was very rude just now
It's okay
Listen, from now on,
we're traveling companions
We'll go to Chiang Mai together
You don't have to say that
You already paid for my taxi
Look, you've lost the tour group,
and you don't have any money with you
How are you gonna complete your list?
Where are you going?
Let me pay for your hotel room
On the road,
people have to help each other
Just like a team
My name is Xu Lang
I'm Baobao
Mom says, if it's too good to be true...
Did your mom ever tell you
that most people in the world are good?
Well... what should we name our team?
The Legends of Thailand
Uhm... anything better?
How about Potato and Mushroom?
Let's stick with the Legends of Thailand
Can I have your passport, sir?
Just a moment
Okay
Give me your passport
I have the membership card
Stop taking pictures!
Oh, get the chair in the picture too
Why?
Just get it in the shot
The Edward Scissorhands' pose
must be the tackiest in the world
Hey! Let's go see a ladyboy show!
They're all guys. What's the point?
What!?
Ladyboys are really boys?
You flew here and you don't know that?
But how do they do it?
Does your phone have 3G?
No
Can it get online with WiFi?
Yeah! I just posted on Weibo. For free!
Hey, look, massage!
Let's go shopping!
No
Then how about a massage treatment?
No
How about dinner?
No
Jeez!
I'll pay the money back!
I can't think about it right now
But I'm hungry.
Go get dinner then
I don't have any money
Help yourself
I don't speak English. I can't order
This hotel?
Yes, that's right, sir
I already have a room
And can you tell me whether people...
using the same card are staying here?
Wait a moment, sir
Yes, have one
This man is my workmate
Today is his birthday
I want to give him some surprise
I need to speak to him
Okay
#2232
Okay
He's not here
You came here for a vacation
Why must you challenge a Thai kickboxer?
I talked to Fan Bingbing's agent
He said I can be her personal bodyguard
if I can beat a Thai kickboxer
Then,
I'll make pancakes for her every day
But Fan can't eat pancakes every day
You don't understand, it's not easy
There's a special way to knead the dough
And you need what kind of dough to use
What spring onions to use
Whether to grill, roast, steam or fry
Okay, okay
how much do you sell one for?
2.5 yuan
What do the ingredients cost?
Less than 1 yuan
How many can you sell in a day?
800
That's a lot!
That's on a slow day!
Your net profit is 26,000 a month...
You could make a lot if you franchised
That's right!
If you had
100 franchisees in Beijing
You could make 500,000 yuan a month
And 6 million a year
That's right!
If there were 5,000 stores nationwide,
you could make 300 million yuan a year
Yeah! That's right!
You'd go public in two years
That's right I could!
How about selling me the recipe?
Sure
My secret recipe is...
that I have to make them all by myself
No hiring anyone and no freezing them,
they must be fresh out of the oven
You'll be making them
til you drop
How did you know that?
I love making pancakes!
Let me show you something cool
Excuse me!
Please!
Okay
What is that?
When you fill up at the gas station,
and your tank is two thirds full,
just add two drops of this
Supergas Petroleum Enhancer
And your gas tank will be full
This is renewable energy
It makes fossil fuels more efficient
This is science, understand?
I understand
So now you know what my job is
Of course!
You work for a TV shopping network!
Do you think ladyboys
were born as ladyboys?
Look behind you. They are ladyboys
Don't look right away!
Wow! They're sexy!
Don't take a picture!
What are you doing?!
Sorry, sorry...
What are you doing?
He did it first
Hey, that's enough
Okay
Thank you
Thank you
Shit!
Someone posted to me on Weibo
Let me see
Did you post the photo of the hotel?
Yeah!
Why did you tag me in the post?
You have more followers than me!
Delete everything now!
But Why?
I don't want people to know where I am
Why are you so boring?
Be more careful from now on, okay?
What star sign are you?
(Thai) Please wait a moment
(Thai) Thank you
You're saying this is a ladyboy?
Here, every beautiful woman you see,
is a ladyboy for sure
Are you sure enough to bet?
Of course! You got the guts to ask her?
DO you?
Of course I do! Do you?
Of course!
Then ask!
Hello!
(Chinese) Hi. I was in the elevator
(Chinese) With World's biggest idiots
Come here!
Come over here!
Do you see that guy?
Follow him, and find out his room number
Don't let yourself be seen
Be quick!
What for?
I'll tell you when you come back. Go!
Quick!
I'm sure
He's the spy from the airport!
I know that
But which room is he in?
Go check again!
#2207 or #2209? Which one is it?
I don't remember
It's one of the two anyway
Baobao?
What?
Can I talk to you for a second?
What's the matter?
Would you go to that guy's room again,
and take his passport?
Why do you want his passport?
You know you can't use it anyway
I just need it as a favor from you
What favor?
Everywhere I go, he follows me
Do you know why?
Why?
He wants to hurt me
Why would he do that?
Because...
I cuckolded him
You slept with him?!
I slept with his wife
You slept with his wife?!
She seduced me first
She seduced you first?!
But we really do love each other
You really do love each other?!
Can you stop repeating me?
How could you do that?!
It was all my fault,
but now he wants to kill me
If he gets to me,
you won't finish one thing on your list
And it was your damn Weibo post
that led him right here
Don't you think you owe it to me?
Did you forget?
We're a team
The Legends of Thailand
Excuse me, sir?
The oil is not enough
Just a moment, please
Be quick!
(Thai) Good evening
Come on!
Come on!
Oh, my, what is that?
You want some whiskey?
Oh, baby!
Huh?
Lower!
Oh, quickly, please
Girls, let's clean up
(Thai) Good evening!
Where's the train?
You take that damn cactus everywhere?
You don't get it
It's only a cactus now
But it will becomes a health tree
It will ward off disease and bad luck
Give me the phone
Where's the map I downloaded last night?
I deleted it
Why'd you do that?
You told me to!
I only asked to delete the Weibo post!
Why didn't you say more clearly?
Don't you have a computer?
My network card only works in China!
You can buy a SIM card in Thailand
Keep an eye on my bag, don't move
I'm gonna get a SIM card
Then tell me what happened last night
Did the ladyboys beat you up?
Who's the kid?
Leave me alone, okay?
INCOMING CALL: WIFE
Wife! You're married?
Does it have anything to do with you?
But you have a kid already?
$0?
And you're still having an affair?!
That was a lie!
Then why don't you pick up the phone?
Hello
Where are you?
What are you doing?!
Hello?
I'm filing for the divorce in two days
Hello? I can't... I can't hear you...
She wants to divorce you, I heard that
Can you hear me now?
10am. Haidian Court. Don't be late
Hello?
Hello. How is Xiao Di?
Do you even care?
But, I'm in Thailand right now
I don't care where you are!
Day after tomorrow. 10am. Don't forget
Why can't you think about my situation?
I'm in Thailand now, in serious trouble
I lost my passport
And my battery's about to die
I'm on the train right now
Xu Lang, I'll never believe you again
Was that your wife?
Does she know about your affair?
Don't ignore me!
Give it back!
Answer me!
Give me that!
You're married! How could you do that?
I'm ordering you to give it back!
Who's the kid?
First...
I'm so sorry
We met less than 24 hours ago
We're not friends, understand?
I'm here for a multi-billion yuan deal
Can you comprehend that?
We've never been a damn team!
Don't say another single word, okay?
Seriously, what star sign are you?
I think you have a split personality!
Have a good trip, sir
See you!
Where is that place?
You can talk now
Do you know where that is?
That's where I wanted to go
Hold on. Can I see that?
Let me have a peek
Baobao...
We're not friends,
why should I help you?
You don't have any money,
and you don't speak English
How are you gonna finish your list?
Tell me you were wrong
I was wrong. I was wrong
Promise you'll help me bless the tree
Okay
And help me finish my list
Okay
And help me take photographs
Okay
100 photographs
Okay
Now swear you'll never cuckold again
But I never did!
Swear it!
I will never...
cuckold anyone...
ever again!
What did you say? I didn't hear you!
I will never cuckold anyone ever again!
Without storms and turmoil
How can legends ever arise?
I'll be waiting right here for you
Wherever you go, whatever you do
It doesn't matter to me
As long as I can be there with you
As long as I can be there with you
But these are everywhere in China
What's so interesting about it?
These are Thai fish!
I'm gonna go buy a hat
Come back quickly
Hi, sir. (Thai) 3km
What?
3km
3km?
Yeah
He didn't tell you where he was going?
You don't understand, we're together
The one who took pictures of me
I can't find him.
I need to find him
(Thai) Then you'd better
start looking
Fine! I... I...
What are you doing here?
So you know who I am!
No, no, no... I don't
I... I don't know you at all
Where is he?
Who are you talking about?
Don't play the fool with me, boy
Are you his tour guide?
Where is he?
I don't know
Where is he?
I really don't know
I have very important business with him
Hello?
I come from China
I'm looking for Mr. Zhou
(Thai) Follow me
I know everything between you both
He told you everything, huh?
In this kind of situation,
you can't just blame one party
My mom said,
it takes two to tango
Life is like a game of chess,
you never know who's going to win
I got used to it a long time ago
You're used to it?
So that means your wife is the problem
This has nothing to do with my wife!
It was your wife who seduced him first
Huh!
But it's true love between them
What?!
But don't worry
I've made him swear,
he'll never cuckold you again
You didn't even know about it?
(Thai) Guys, he's finally here
(Thai) Zhou, someone's here to see you
(Thai) Come on in!
Mr. Zhou?
(Thai) You're sure? You want it all?
(Thai) That's right
(Thai) Yeah
(Thai) Who are you?
I come from China
I'm looking for Mr. Zhou
This is Mr. Zhou
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Zhou Yang
Mr. Yang Zhou
(Thai) I don't know who he is
(Thai) Didn't you say nobody knew?
I thought this was a temple
Hey!
(Thai) Don't let him leave!
No? I'm sorry. It's a mistake
I'm sorry
Why did you just leave me like that?!
What are you doing here?
You know I can't speak English!
I know
You wanna break up with me, right?
Can you keep it down?
I'm gonna yell, dammit!
Shh!
Don't shush me!
You have no right to shush me!
And who's he?
I... I don't know him
You what?!
(Thai) I said we shouldn't come today
We slept in the same room last night!
(Thai) I told you to keep outsiders out!
Why did you leave me there?
Please calm down
Why did you leave me?
Can you please shut up now?
I can't!
Just calm down
I'm not calm!
Where did you find this postcard?
Why did you leave me?!
You know you gave me wrong directions?
I'm not your tour guide!
This isn't even a temple!
How is this not a temple?!
Gao, still here I see
Xu Lang!
You're out to get me every which way?
Listen, this is no place for a scene
Why not?
You don't play by any rules
Leave! Now!
Oh, what? You think I'm afraid of you?
Don't get physical, alright?
Now I know why you knelt to your wife
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
Was it the Shanghai trip?
What about Shanghai?
Will you stop pretending already?
What am I pretending about?
Just admit it!
Admit what?
Don't you dare try changing the subject
We are not done with this!
Where's Mr. Zhou?
Right here!
He's not Mr. Zhou
Of course I know that he's not
He is Mr. Zhou
Who are you?
None of your business! Who are you?
You don't even know who I am?
Why would I care?
Who is he?
He's Mr. Zhou
No, he's not Mr. Zhou
He said he's Mr. Zhou
This isn't the Mr. Zhou I'm looking for
So which Mr. Zhou are you looking for?
It's none of your business!
Are you nuts?
Don't you see there's a problem here?
I saw the problem long ago!
I swear to God...
That time in Shanghai...
Let go!
Don't fight!
You think I'm blind?
It's dangerous here!
We were classmates! I'm just married!
Don't you see something is wrong here?
You had fun with the ladyboys!
On my hotel bill!
I'm gonna kill you!
(Thai) They're all cops!
Stop!
It was just an affair!
My mom said,
open a door,
and the dragon will enter
You know kung fu?!
I told you I'm here for Thai kickboxing
So go fight them!
I only have one move!
So you've hired a bodyguard, huh?
I was being followed!
(Thai) It's that undercover cop! Baldie!
Don't move!
Nobody move!
(Thai) Easy, easy, easy
You interpret for me
The rest of you, over there!
Everybody, step back!
Step back! Step back!
You two, come over here
Wang Bao! Wang Bao! Out!
Gao Bo, you too
Now! Now!
Back!
Go!
This way!
This way!
They're coming from that way!
What are you carrying?
Your suitcase!
This is my suitcase!
Then whose is this?
You're unbelievable! Just kill me!
No! No! No!
This way
Give me the suitcase!
Calm down... Calm down...
Stop... Stop...
His car is at the back gate!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Come on, hurry up!
I don't have the keys!
I have them!
What the hell are you doing?
Where's the car?
This way
Stop it! Stop right there!
Taaah!
W0-taaaa!
Daaaaa!
Supergas!
What are you doing?
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Hey! You hit me!
Help!!!
Where are we going?
How should I know?
You led the way!
It wasn't on purpose!
But you... You abandoned me on purpose!
You got us lost and deleted the map!
You did it all on purpose, didn't you?
Are you the biggest idiot in the World?
Or are you just the perfect curse?
I was just trying to help
Fat lot of good that did!
They almost killed me!
You've got your own problems!
What?
You slept with someone else's wife!
Bullshit!
And you set him up!
He deserved it!
They might kill him!
Why are we stopping?
What are you doing?
I'm gonna go back to save him!
Who exactly is that man to you?
We work together
But we're more like enemies
We're both looking for the same guy
Our boss
Whoever doesn't finds him gets fired,
and loses everything. Do you understand?
You still have me!
Who the hell are you?
I'm Baobao!
Don't you remember, we're a team!
Team?
Like Batman and Robin?
You gave me your phone
Only because he was tracking its GPS
So I put it in your bag instead
To confuse him
Then why did you pay for my hotel room?
Don't you remember?
You also paid for my taxi
You paid for everything!
I've been using you, you fool!
Just go away!
I'll see you in court in two days
I'm taking Xiao Di back to Shanghai
I'm lost
Hey!
I found a town over there!
Why did you come back?
I don't have any money
Darling
Two things, okay?
First, send me some money
Where the hell are you, cripple-neck?
Don't use that tone of voice with me!
What?
The other thing can wait 'til later
What are you talking about?
I think you know what I'm talking about
I know what?
Tell me about Xu Lang
What about Xu Lang?
Tell me who the baby's father is?
Rubbish!
Is this the second thing?
I swear I'll abort the baby right now!
The father's a barnyard pig, that's who!
Go to hell!
(Thai) It's done
(Thai) Yeah, it went well
(Thai) At first he didn't want to pay
(Thai) So we had to beat him up
Hey!
It's the Water Splashing Festival!
And people will fly sky lanterns
Let's go have some fun
No thanks. You have a good time yourself
I'm telling you,
We're not gonna fix the car today
How would you know that?
Todayâ€œ.
Not okay...
Tomorrow morning, okay?
See, I'm right!
We're not going anywhere today
Come on! Let's go have some fun
You go have your fun. I don't want to
Why are you so gloomy?
I should take your brain out and wash it
You go have a good time
I'll go wash my brain, ok?
Do you have Wi-Fi here?
Follow me
No, no, no...
No, no, no... Computer! Computer!
No, no, no, no... Computer!
Leave me alone, okay?
Brainwashing time!
I...
I just wanted to wash your brain
It's okay
I've gotten used to you already
I'm very sorry
You want this?
Yes! How do you go?
Follow me. The village chief knows
Wake up! Wake up!
Where's the map?
Map? You should have it
Were you looking at the map last night?
I'll help you look for it
Gao Bo, calm down
Xu Lang!
You crossed the line!
Look, put the knife away
No one needs
to get hurt
Hurt?!
You wanna talk to me about getting hurt?
How the hell did you find me here?
Where's the map?
What map?
I am asking you where the map is
Here's the map!
We'll talk about you cuckholding me,
once I get the power of attorney
Gao Bo, listen
Calm down...
Xu Lang, you've gone too far
He never actually slept with your wife!
Go die in a fire!
Don't you know kung fu?
Kick him!
I can't lift my leg without a platform
10L gas, 30% consumption efficiency...
5km...
You, step away from the map
There's still a chance
We can catch up with him
But how?
This!
One!
Come on! Let's go!
Get in! Get in the car!
Have some water
Thank you
Did the car start?
No
It usually works in the movies
Put two drops of this into the gas tank
Just two drops
Done!
We need that key
How tall are you?
I'm not being suspicious,
I'm just asking
What's there to ask?
So you're saying I can't even ask you?
I don't even have the right to know?
What do you want to know?
Just tell me!
Are you going to tell me or not?
Let's both calm down
And let's think it through
Why is it we tried so many times before?
Right!
And it never worked!
How come this time it worked?
Just one time, and you got pregnant!
What?
You have to ask yourself, right?
Damn it!
Now you're swearing at me?
Swear at me again. Try it
Shit
Even in English!
I'm not cursing at you
Then who are you cursing?
You know I'm pregnant here
And I'm all alone far from home!
Yeah, I know that
You don't know anything!
But there are principles, right?
Principles!
Right?
Alright, tell me your principles!
Damn it!
You're rude, aren't you, cripple-neck?
I'm not rude, and not swearing at you!
Then who are you swearing at?
Really, try it again, swear at me again!
Damn!
Gao Bo, you tricky...
Thief! Thief!
(Thai) Calling Unit 1, calling Unit 1,
(Thai) The Buddha thief is wearing all black
No! No! No!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
You idiot! Get in the car
Speak English!
French?
Shit!
They're the ones who took it, I swear!
You guys have to go get him!
Go! Go! Go!
Look, if you're not going to listen...
I... I... forget it
(Thai) Get back here!
He's following us!
Didn't I tell you to get the trike key?
I thought we were still gonna drive it,
so I didn't get the key
Then why do you think we stole this key?
Yeah, why?
The road's blocked!
I know!
Chickens! Look out for the chickens!
I see them!
It feels like we're in a real movie!
What's wrong?
Smoke!
There's smoke coming from the hood!
I know! How many drops did you add?
The whole bottle
What?!
Are you only good at making pancakes?
And donkey meat sandwiches, noodles...
What?
Oh, and pizza too!
What the hell kind of road is this?
Shut up!
That was so much fun!
Shut up!
Let's ride the elephant across!
Hurry!
Sorry! Sorry!
Here, take the money!
Money! Money! Money!
Elephant! Elephant!
One thousand baht!
Hurry!
Hey!
Nice helmet!
Hurry! Hurry!
Take a picture of him! Take a picture!
You're a fighter pilot!
Say cheese!
Yeah!
Yeah, keep showing off!
Help!
Don't get wet!
Don't grab me!
My health tree! My health tree!
Not the right time! Let it go!
You're unbelievable!
Let go!
Don't grab my head!
Let go!
Help!
Quit grabbing my head!
Stop it!
Help! I can't swim!
Where are we?
Thaï¬‚and
Help! Help!
Hurry UP!
Help! Help! Help!
Help! Help! Help!
What in hell are you doing?
What?
Did God send you to torture me?
I just make spring onion pancakes
Just calm down
Why should I calm down?
You're the world's stupidest creature!
It's really The Lord of the Rings!
Huh?
Finding the One Ring would be easier!
Take it easy
Seriously, where did you come from?
I'm done!
I'll smash it all!
Don't do this...
I don't want anything anymore!
I'll just smash it all up!
Hey, calm down, alright?
There! I smashed it! Happy?
Are you happy now?
You slapped me!
You feel better?
How dare you!
When I was young, and acting crazy,
my mom would slap me to calm me down
Did your mother slap you enough?
Was that how she brought you up?
Stop it! You can say anything you like
but leave my mom out of it
I just did!
Like mother, like son. Isn't that right?
Enough! Enough! Don't!
What are you doing?
VVo4aaaah!
I'm sorry
I kicked you too hard
I told you,
I know kung fu
It's The Lord of the Rings?
Bro...
Bro!
You're Gollum!
Insane!
Insane! Crazy!
I'm Frodo Baggins!
Unbelievable!
What's wrong with you?
Don't move!
Just let me cry for a bit!
Don't move!
Kill it! Kill it!
Are you ready?
This leaf will help disinfect the wound
My grandpa taught me
Don't you ever tell anyone about this
Trust me,
I won't put this on Weibo
I invented Supergas
I've been working on it for four years
The commercial potential is limitless
But Gao Bo
and I have different plans
He wants to sell it to the French
But I want to keep developing it,
because I know it isn't perfect yet
Mr. Zhou is the biggest shareholder,
and only he can bestow power of attorney
The letter of attorney's a golden ticket
With it.
It's nothing but clean sailing ahead
The knife
was my birthday present to him
Thanks to Supergas,
we're enemies instead of old friends
It's cost me a lot to beat him
Now, even my family is abandoning me
You have no idea what I'm talking about
What are you writing?
A travel diary
You're writing the sad story of my life?
I'm not writing about you at all
Look
Tonight,
we're grilling snake meat in the jungle
Did you ever expect that could happen?
Life has so many unexpected things
Everybody feels lost sometimes
But I think, in your case,
you're not actually lost
You can fix things up with your wife
That's easier said than done
Is it really that difficult?
What?
Just call your wife
No! Stop it
Just call her
What am I gonna say?
Anything you want
Go!
Hello?
International calls
are not activated...
What's wrong with you?
My health tree is dead!
How did that happen?
Is Supergas toxic?
No way!
Can't be!
Maybe you watered it too much?
Let's go. It's just over that bridge
ls there anything left on the list?
There's no health tree anymore,
so now it's just Thai kickboxing
Don't even think about that
Come over here. Let's take a photo
What happened?
Let me see
The memory card is full!
Help me put it all back in the bag
I spied a spy in the bathroom!
Here it is!
I forgot my wallet this morning
Where's the map?
It's here
All right, let's take a picture
Do it!
What is this?
What is that?
You're working with Gao Bo, right?
What do you mean? Just take the picture!
No wonder,
he could follow me so easily!
Am I in Infernal Affairs?
What is Infernal Affairs?
Can you explain this?
Why is there a GPS tracker
in your bag?
This is a GPS tracker?
Why did you come to Thailand?
I'm a tourist
You've been with me the whole time,
and you call that being a tourist?
Yeah. I lost the tour group,
and I have no money
What's this?
Who gave you this?
Gao Bo
No, I...
Let me ask you again
Why did you come to Thailand?
I'm here for my honeymoon
With who?
With Fan Bingbing?
How did you know?
Where is she then?
In my heart
My mom
is a big fan of Fan!
Still obsessed over stars at her age!
A fan of Fan!
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No!
Why would I lie to you?
You and your family are all crazy!
I'm warning you,
you can say anything about me,
but not my mom!
You're nuts!
And so is your mom!
Warning you! Don't talk about my mom!
Liar!
Mom, I'm already on honeymoon...
with Fan Bingbing
We stayed in Bangkok's best hotel,
and ate Thai pancakes
They're called Tom-Yum-Goong Pizza
We took a lot of pictures together
Bingbing said,
I should start a pancakes franchise
Once it goes public on the market,
I'd be the CEO
We've taken a train together,
been on the bus, on tuk-tuks,
even on a Thai trishaw
We went to a Thai foot massage parlor
We rode an elephant
And Bingbing completely loved it
She said elephants bring us luck
Oh, right
Also the local Water Splashing Festival
That very same night,
we set off sky lanterns
At that moment,
I realized that,
I was living the most
beautiful moment of my life
When we find the temple,
and plant your health tree,
I know your health will get better
You'll become,
the healthiest, happiest mother ever,
and I'll make a grandson for you soon
Mom, we love you
They'll build this temple soon
Are you Mr. Xu?
Are you Chinese?
That's right
Mr. Zhou and I are in meditation class
I'm helping around the temple here
He said you'd come before he left
He's back in Beijing now, right?
He left something for you before he left
Just a moment
Xu Lang,
you've gone too far!
Where's Zhou?
He went back to Beijing
Give me the letter of attorney
I don't have it
And I think you should forget about it
Oh, you're so funny!
We're gonna settle this today
Where's you bodyguard?
I don't have one
Here's your money!
I didn't spend a penny of it
Shit!
I came back to tell you,
if I were on his side,
I'd not have mentioned the airport spy
vvhatspy?
YOu!
Baobao,
I was wrong
Gao Bo...
Cut this rubbish!
Give me the letter of attorney
I don't have it
You must be Gao Bo?
Mr. Zhou left this for both of you
He said you can decide who takes it
So, you know Thai kickboxing?
I'm here to fight, son
My Mom said...
Hey!
Let go!
You can't have it!
Let go!
Supergas has problems!
You're the only problem!
Save me!
No time right now!
Take a picture of me!
Use your killer move!
I need a platform to stand on!
The Legends of Thailand!
Saaaaaaay cheeeeeeeeeeeese!
You got it?
Take a look
So exhausted!
Zhou knew we would fight over this
The contract demands that we both sign
That actually makes things easier
Name your terms
Xu Lang!
Why don't you work with me?
I have a deal with the French already
I just need your signature
20-80, how about 20-80?
30-70, is that all right?
Fine, 40-60
50-50! 50-50!
Don't get greedy on me!
Fine, fine, Xu Lang,
I'll do it your way, okay?
Like you said, we'll take the long view
We'll talk to the venture capitalists
and keep developing and researching
I know there are problems with Supergas
Let's work them out
I'll listen to you
Get the shot?
I got it all. Everything!
Just one more thing on the list
The health tree
Well, what do you think?
This time,
I'm standing aside
Here's your knife back
Gao Bo...
Maybe this is a new beginning
Baobao...
Let's go
Oh. Your wife and I...
Really, nothing happened
Have a good life together
He and your wife...
Really, nothing happened
Mr. Xu,
a taxi driver dropped off your passport
Just wait here for a minute
Darling, it's me
Are you guys already on the plane?
Darling...
Am I never going to see Xiao Di again?
I just have one request
Let me take her to Ocean Park one time
I gave up the letter of attorney thing
I gave it all up
Or I don't think I'd have anything left
Can I just have one last chance?
Darling, I'm sorry
I miss you so much
You're both so important to me...
Darling, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I asked Xiao Di that day,
if mom and dad really got a divorce,
who she would want to stay with
You know what she said?
She said she wants to be with you
She never wanted us to break up
Hi, Baobao?
Yeah, it's me!
Know who this is?
Xu Lang!
I want to try your spring onion pancakes
Can you send some over?
Sure! Absolutely!
Where to?
And wear something nice,
I want to take some pictures with you
Huh?
Pictures?
Dad!
Can we go to Ocean Park again?
Yes, I think we can do that?
Do you regret giving up Supergas?
It's just like that tooth
After Wang Bao kicked it out,
it didn't hurt anymore
Why am I wearing this?
Here
What do you think of what I'm wearing?
Is this okay?
Of course!
We didn't get to the beach last time,
so I wanted to make it up to you
Sure, what pose do you want?
Anything but Edward Scissorhands!
It's fine, it isn't a fashion shoot
It's' a honeymoon shoot
Honeymoon?
With whom?
Hello
I'm Fan Bingbing
You're... who?
Fan... Bing... Bing...
You're... Fan...
Fan... Fan.. Fan... Fan... Bing...
I heard,
you wanted to go on honeymoon with me?
Ho...
Ho... ho... honeymoon?
Can we...
Take some pictures together?
Pic... pictures?
Come here
Come on
Put your arm around me
Pu... Pu...
Pu... Pu.. Put my arm around you?
Would you stop repeating her?
Come on
Put your arm here. Look at the camera
I'm done!
Can you do some backrubs?
Come here
Happy?
So happy I could die!
Oh yeah!
Remember Gads passport from his room?
I forgot
I didn't realise that I had it
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe!
Push, baby! Push!
It's out?
Boy or girl?
Does it look like me?
Does it have any hair?
