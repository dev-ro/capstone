My salutations to Tamil people
and a Indians.
The honorable American President,
the Indian prime minister and
the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.
How I chanced to share this
historical stage with them and speak here
... is by itself a big story.
In a way, it's a story about our world.
Not only that. it's a story
about a god too.
A question might arise, why a rational
scientist like me to tell a tale of god.
The idol, Lord Govindaraja
is a proponent in this story.
Hence, this god's story has
to be told as well.
Stories abound about Lord Govindaraja.
The briefest version would still take us
back to the 12th century.
So, 12th century.
A time when Jesus and Allah hadn't
permeated India and it's politic.
Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu had
no other gods to fight and play with.
So... they fought a proxy war
through their devotees in the 12th century.
As life springs from womb, the laws
of the world springs from the Holy Wisdom.
Pray at Their feet, sing praises
of Shiva and his conceit.
That our way of Him
and sacred laws may be perpetuated.
Amok in elephant, a religion in man.
madness results only in trouble.
Kulothungan Cholan the Second
was fond of the Saivism.
Religion culture turned into racism.
At Thillai, in Shiva's temple.
Lord Govindaraja was a co-tenant.
Kulothungan Cholan, king of kings.
Ruled that the idol to be shifted.
But the truth, the idol was
pried loose.
I’m a disciple of Saint Ramanuja.
Strength, Lord Narayana.
Hail.
Narayana, our Lord.
Tell the grandson of the Great Chola
who abolished taxes.
That he must abolish his pride.
Tell him, Rangarajan Nambi says so.
The accursed king will add one more
grievous curse, that of a Brahmin.
O, Giver of peace, You vanquish sin
in Thee we seek life and harmony.
Thine the Universe
and the substance of skies.
Thine the darkness. Thine the light.
Thou art nourishment. Thine all nature
Thou art perfection, Personified.
In Thee. O, Lord of all creation.
I seek freedom from fear.
Nambi, look here.
O, king, do not harm my husband.
Rangarajan Nambi.
This stone shall be drowned in the sea.
You have a family.
Go home.
Don't make her a widow.
The last man who refused to
betray Ramanuja was blinded.
So, you know.
I do not know where Ramanuja is.
Even if do, I shall not tell you.
Even in peril of death.
If had so wished,
you'd be dead already.
I know where your rebel
guru Ramanuja is.
I know how to trick Ramanuja into
coming out to the open.
I know how cleverly the entire land
may be forced to worship only to Lord Shiva.
O, Lord Vishnu!
Did you notice how Lord Vishnu
makes you to chant his name, Kulothungan?
My husband.
- Let him go.
He was my childhood friend.
His Vishnu culture makes war
only with words.
My Shiva need not intercede.
I am enough to make you sing
songs in His praise.
Step aside and let that
idol of stone be buried in sea.
Promise to speak only the name of Shiva.
Accept Him as the Almighty.
None other.
Your wife may be saved from
a widow's life.
Say it.
What difference do names of Gods make?
Do not ruin my life.
You are my Lord!
Obey the king.
He's the Lord of our world.
Just reduce the three words.
Say hail.
Say it, please.
If I refuse to say means?
You'll accompany that stone to the sea.
And go to your disgraceful heaven.
No place for traitors in my heaven.
In my heaven
even the cursed are welcome.
Come and see for yourself.
If not for my sake,
then for the sake of our son, please!
Say it, father.
For my sake, father.
Hail Lord Narayana,
Preserver of all Life.
Rangarajan Nambi died not
by an act of Shiva.
Nor is Vishnu to be blamed
for Nambi's death despite his faith.
Stories abound of abandoned believers
in annals of both Theosophy and science.
Today, science can be questioned.
But the propaganda's first contention is
religion is unquestionable, infallible.
They vehemently insist there's a power
above all Accept it, know it as such.
Logically, if you stack up
forces of nature in ascending order...
There's bound to be one on the very top
For example,
The satellite.
Which right now roams the domain
of the gods.
A super power.
But this so-called superpower
that keeps an eye on the earth.
And the Supreme Power that is credited
to have created the earth...
Both failed to save the world
and my Tami Nadu in the hour of need.
A truth the world knows.
For example, December 26, 2004.
The sea outsmarted the roving eye
of god and satellite.
And brought deluge and destruction
in the Bay of Bengal.
But where's the connection between
my story and these facts?
World history is a
progression of a series of events.
The western world has a theory
called "The Chaos Theory".
According to this scientific theory.
A events in the world are co-related.
Concurrent.
It connects the fluttering of
a butterfly wings...
to an earthquake tremor.
My story begin with a quake.
And end with the flutter of a butterfly.
You are our savior who rescued my child!
If you are a man enough,
touch his feet and beg for
his forgiveness.
O, Lord Narayana, has my son
reached Your abode? Take me there too.
Allah has saved us.
From Allah we come.
unto Allah we return.
Mr. Avtaar, you are safe now.
Nothing is wrong with you now.
Look, your relatives have come.
Don't be afraid.
Turn and see.
Come on, turn.
You can turn around.
The second part of the story
begins in Washington D.C.
And I, the narrator of this story,
became an integral part
and protagonist of the story.
Like the fanatic king with his religion,
I was fascinated with my research.
Born in Tanjore, as Ramasamy Naiker son.
Here I am, after a doctorate in biotech.
Playing with micro organisms.
Like me, many brilliant scientists
played the game of synthetic bio-weapons.
Until fate intervened
on December 20, 2004.
America after September 11
was paranoid about defense against
bio-weapons.
I, Govindarajan was a part of it.
I will tell you in Tamil.
The president is giving 1.3 billion dollars
for research on biological weapons.
Sheila.
Don't give chocolates for Hanu.
Nothing except apples,
Hanu.
You'll get worms.
Oh, not for you?
For your baby?
Don't give me that yarn.
Let's go, Govind.
- Ya, I'm coming.
The equipment in there is worth millions.
What's more important?
Dollars? Or our lives?
Today a monkey,
Tomorrow a country might perish.
A country, no less.
Look Govind, these concerns.
- Didn't they occur to me before?
Some silly scientist like me and a
clever runaway monkey like Hanu,
caused the AIDS virus
that's rattling the world today.
Our virus is worse.
Why are you behaving like a unionist?
Think a bit.
The venture capitalists will ask questions.
What do I tell them?
Telling them is your job, not mine.
Okay. forget about your
current pay.
How much more do you want?
I will make arrangements.
How many millions you want?
Even a hundred million.
- Okay.
Not even for a hundred million
would get into your game.
See me through till the end of it
and we'll put the money to good use.
They are businessman.
They'll do anything.
Anything?
What do you mean?
Like selling to terrorists.
Would let that to happen?
It's just the manner of speaking.
Where are you?
I'm scared the way Dr. Sethu
is going about things.
He's going to sell us out.
He'd never do that.
Is your wife in the car?
Yuka?
- Yes, Govind-san. I'm listening.
I don't think he'd do that.
Even if he does what can we do?
I'll come to your place and tell.
I'll ask Yuka to cook.
Stay for dinner.
Why can't it happen?
It happened in the lab.
We were able to contain it in
an enclosed environment.
If it's released in the air.
Millions will die. A nation can be
decimated. That's how dangerous it is.
And Dr. Sethu has sold it!
- Sethu wouldn't do that.
He's a good man.
- Let him prove that to the FBI.
It shouldn't become warm.
Where can we keep it?
In the refrigerator.
- Good idea.
Why, because it's a virus?
- No, to keep out moisture.
Dinner will be ready.
- No thanks.
Tension killed my appetite.
No matter what happens,
life must go on.
Advice from a Hiroshima girl.
Listen to me, brother.
- Okay, sister.
Call the FBI.
- I'm checking the directory.
Call them quickly.
Dr. Sethu, he's insisting me
to call the FBI.
No, I haven't.
No, he's inside with my wife.
Money?
How much money did
he pay you?
Are you a man or what?
Whatever I am.
I'm not a fool like you.
Suresh.
Shit.... Ram?
Not Shit Ram, man.
Sail Ram, remember?
Sweating in winter?
Jogging or drinking?
Why are you reversing?
Why are they chasing you?
How does he find me wherever go?
I ask you why, you ask me how?
He's tracking me by my cell phone.
Why did you chuck it into that car?
To set the Satan on his tail
You get me to the FBl.
Hey! I'm no taxi, man....
First, got to send all those parcels
by tonight's last flight to India.
First courier, then only everything else.
Okay, do whatever.
Go. go.
Will you be back soon, please?
Give me five minutes, okay.
I don't like anyone fiddling
with my car.
First, get me to the FBI
They'll buy you a brand new
whatever car you want.
This packet....
Hey, where's my packet?
Did you take it?
Look here.
I've mailed my five packets.
Hey, ook.
It's right there.
This is not mine.
I don't know. whose?
- Hey. that's mine.
How many packets did you send?
Five.
Sorry, man.
Grab it.
India? Disaster.
Father in heaven!
Help!
Spare me.
I'll tell you Govind's whereabouts
here and in India.
Even in Madras.
Tokyo - Japan
In Nikajo Osaki technique,
opponent's arm is beat to his side.
And then behind him.
Lock the wrist and throw down.
The opponent's arm is beat...
into a key-lock.
And thrown
in Shomen Iminage technique,
Let the opponent's power low past you.
And throw him in a different
direction sideways.
In Sokurran Iminage,
Chop him down with
your spread-out palm.
In mni Tsuki, enter into
the opponent's place, catch his chin.
Sadly.
Your little sister....
And her husband have been killed.
She was wearing that medal
when she died.
Thank you very much.
How fluent are you in Tamil?
Can you see my body clearly?
- Very clear.
My Tamil is clearer than this.
He asks whether you'll do as told?
- Hey, know English too.
What did he say?
Told me to show you what
heaven is all about.
See you in heaven.
Don't talk to me
like an American policeman.
Tell me as one Japanese to another.
Who did it?
I was your student in Japan first.
His name is
Govind Ramasamy.
- Govind Ramasamy?
Ah, Apparao.
Let it wait.
I'm at work.
Balram Naidu. Research and Analysis Wing.
Srinivasulu, sir.
Srinivasulu.
Telugu?
- Yes, sir.
Native village?
- Srikakulam.
Srinivasulu, which container was he in?
- That one, sir.
Master of Sciences.
And then
a doctorate in Biology.
You have a lot of degrees.
Are you a terrific scientist
or a scientific terrorist?
Who put out the lights?
What's this, a nuptial night?
On the lights!
Like cinema lighting.
How can I make out if a
criminal is lying?
I need to see the face.
That's it!
Tanjore.
That makes you a Tamilan.
What is India's largest spoken language?
Hindi.
Do you know the second largest?
- Tamil.
Telugu Tamil is only the third
am a Telugu.
Was deputed to Tamil Nadu.
I learnt Tamil and I speak fluently.
But you're from Tanjore,
speak English?
How will Tamil survive then?
Some Telugu's like you will rescue it.
Look... I want to talk to someone of
higher rank... a higher official.
A patron of Tamil is nice,
but at the same time one must know ...
At least a spattering of science.
How about telephoning the President?
Son of a scientist!
I'm the highest here.
Anything higher and you'll be in heaven.
Are you the leader of this gang?
Or are you working for any other agency?
Which agency?
Lashkar-e-Toiba?
Al- Qaeda or ULFA?
Do you know what Hydrebadi Pill is?
I will explain.
The standard-size police baton
is inserted into your body
till only six inches of it
is sticking out.
They always strike the stick
with every question.
And everything is purged out.
Including the truth.
If you're stubborn, I'll shoot you
and’ll say that you tried to escape.
Brother, your ball is in my court.
One kick and out comes your orange-sized
hydrocele in surgery. What you say?
I’ll tell you the truth.
That parcel contains a dangerous substance.
- I know that.
Synthetic biotechnology. A small vial
that could kill us. Am I Right?
That's exactly why need to
talk to a scientist, not a policeman.
It shouldn't get too hot
or too cold.
Like some mystical hybrid creature?
Neither this nor that?
Shall tell you?
That vial.
Is not in the container
that you came in.
Sir, the vial is not in that container.
My point too!
Are you translating my words to me?
No vial in the container.
It was searched.
Your body was searched too.
No vial found.
Thought you've swallowed it, but no
because it's a virus and if you did,
then at least, you'd have diarrhea.
But no.
I want answers.
Pat. pat, pat.
Come in.
Who's that?
Come in.... is that Apparao?
Yes, sir.
- Come.
From America.
Just say it.
- Two FBI officers have come from America.
What do you want me to do?
They are in a rush.
- Show them the toilet.
Not that...
- Say I'm busy with investigations.
These foreigners you welcome them,
give them garlands.
Give them coconuts with a straw to sip
and leave them sit on the vip lounge.
Do I have to tell you everything? Do it!
- Understood. sir
It's urgent. I'll be downstairs.
Meanwhile if he's thirsty,
don't give him water.
In India, guests are treated like gods.
The bosses in Delhi tell me to pay tribute
to the white guests. I'll be back.
I want to talk to him.
- To whom?
The one on the phone your boss.
Silly boy, I'm far better.
That man is a turbaned Sikh.
In his turban, he carries long pins.
He'll ask you pointed questions.
At least, the FBI agents?
- Yes, the Americans are coming.
The American Pill!
When they hit the end of the stick,
I'll like to hear which language
you'll scream in.
VIP guests for Mr. Balram Naidu...
- He went to the VIP lounge to meet them.
I've brought his guests here.
Let them wait here.
Sir, look! There.
Oh shit! Guard.
- Sit down.
Don't. Inspector.
But it's enough to blow your brains.
Want your brains splattered all over us?
Here is the lady's gun.
Don't lie - put it in a different
box to keep it cool.
By now, it's on its way
to another destination.
Tell me where? Else ...
- What? Will you kill me?
Do you have a family
and children?
Two boys.
Apparao, have the coconut taken away.
Yes, sir.
Only you are allowed.
They must exit via immigration.
They are from America.
FBI agents.
But two agents just went out.
These are the others.
- need permission from superiors.
Gurvinder, stand here.
I'll go and ask the boss.
- A right.
Big crowd.
I'll fetch the luggage.
Hang on.
Mom, tell dad to fetch the luggage.
- All right.
Photos, please?
- Photos? As many as you want.
You can ask me in Tamil.
You still remember Tamil?
- How can forget?
From this soil, I sprung
Tamil Nadu, I can't forget.
However high I climb in life,
won't forget.
For me, this is a temple. Home of
60 million gods, who inhabit this soil.
Even she has not forgotten Tamil.
True, haven't.
But if I keep talking to you.
I will forget my luggage.
See! She's joking in Tamil as well.
Lets go outside.
A huge amount of money has been spent.
A tickets are sold out.
Will you sing in Tamil. Hindi or Punjabi?
I'll sing in any language that
my fans like.
You're coughing badly.
How will you sing?
Don't worry.
Just a day or two...
Blood... goodness, he's bleeding.
What happened?
Ranjita.
Move aside... move.
God!
Say something?
- God help me.
Don't let them in.
Please keep an eye for a while.
Someone call a doctor.
Careful, careful with him.
Inspectors, you got a phone?
Where are we now?
On the Chengalpet Bridge.
Good, what's the address?
First, take him to the hospital.
The inspector is wounded.
Take him to the hospital.
I have a deadline.
I'll be late then.
If he doesn't go to the hospital,
you'll go to the jail.
He's a police inspector.
- Okay, get in.
Drive.
Apparao.
- Yes?
That vial isn't in the container.
And they are leaving Why?
I suppose Govind, the gang leader,
put the vial some where else.
Get the courier on phone.
Get their dispatch lists.
A foreigner and a lady came here.
Only a foreigner?
No Govind?
Who's Govind?
- You don't need to know.
Tell me what else had happened?
They barged in all of a sudden,
destroyed everything and left.
Then, what happened?
- They asked for the list of dispatches.
And you gave it?
- Didn't. They took it.
Then?
- They smashed the hard discs and left.
I have a duplicate dispatch lists
which I've been trying to give you.
Who is this boy?
Name?
- Narasimha Rao.
Telugu?
- No sir, Kannada.
No problem!
Both languages use a similar script.
Narasimha Rao, how many dispatches
here been made out of this list?
Nearly 200.
- Can we raise 200 policemen?
Tough. The prime minister is visiting.
- Well, we'll make do.
Put a man on each address for surveillance.
Narasimha Rao and Apparao,
you must co-operate round the clock.
Even the CIA is co-operating with RAW.
What more is needed? They mustn't escape.
A newspapers must carry their photos.
Their reputation should be ruined.
They just can't cruise around Tamil Nadu.
Tell Grandma to come, please.
- Please wait.
That's my parcel.
- It's for Grandma.
No, I mailed it to myself.
- Are you Grandma?
Grandma, come here.
There's a parcel for you by courier.
For me? Come on.
Has he sent me a parcel?
Must be Aravarnudan?
- Careful.
Krishnaveni, parcel for you.
- I know.
Watch your step.
- I know.
Give it.
- Who's this? Another son?
Another son.
- No! She has only one son.
But this is coming from a different place.
He travels all over.
- She's nuts.
Oh, I see.
Please sign.
Grandma's thumb sign.
Give.
- Here.
Ask her.
Hey courier... over here.
What was that guy asking?
Who are you to ask that?
- Police intelligence.
Come that side.
Hey! Not with a cop looking on
Zip up, man.
They make me work the yuckiest holes.
There you go.
Have you spotted the guy?
Is he the one?
Same as the one in the photo, sir.
He asked the courier about a parcel.
But an old lady took the parcel.
Now he's fighting with another man
who just stepped out.
They just made up and
went inside.
Don't let him out of your sight.
Stay right there.
Do you have a back-up support?
Only the courier boy.
He's a raw hand.
But I'm a family man, sir.
My sister is getting marry next month.
I've sent you an invitation, sir.
He's an international terrorist.
Please send a police force.
I'm a one and unarmed.
Who's this man?
- Local police, sir.
How can you be afraid?
You're a policeman, right?
A huge force is coming. Be brave.
Above all, I'm coming.
Is that all, sir?
Over, sir?
Check the parcel, then give it to me.
Otherwise, give it to the police.
Anda ...Anda ....
- What is it now?
Krishnaveni got upset and locked
herself in again.
How many locks will we break?
Which Krishnaveni?
- The one who took your parcel.
What happened to her?
- She lost her mind.
Because of the parcel
- No, long before we were born.
She's in the closet.
- I know.
Her son went abroad to study
and died. Since then.
Since when?
I wasn't even born.
- My point.
She thinks her son is alive.
Thanks to friends in US.
They send medicines for her.
What the hell is this?
Wait, just wait.
Grandma Krishna.... I'm Andal.
Can you come out?
Can't. This is my parcel.
Where is that goddamned man?
There are so many.... goddamned people here.
Must be me.
- Oh.
The one behind the parcel?
- No, came with it.
He is here.
He doesn't want the whole parcel.
Only something inside it.
The police has been informed.
Nothing to be afraid of. Come out.
Ok, I'm coming.
It isn't comfortable in the closet.
What's your name, boy?
Goodness!
- That's hardly a name.
Is this yours?
- Yes, yes.
Grandma, give it to me, please.
But what is this?
- This thing, I can't quite speak about.
The unspeakable?
Like a girl missing her charms?
Grandma! Don't open it.
Did you get it?
Neither did I.
But it resembles chocolate.
It's a virus. Flit gets out,
everyone will die.
Don't be scared.
We'll all die anyway.
But we'll die now if it gets out.
No. no.
Not the exploding type.
Only, it must never leak.
He said his name is Govind.
But he looks like a terrorist.
Brother, I'm leaving.
- Stop, the inquiry isn't over yet.
An international terrorist is with Govind.
Look! These photos
will be in the papers tomorrow.
There will be more.
- What?
The policeman who found the terrorist
and the courier who helped him.
You will be in the news
and you want to leave.
Where is the monastery?
- There.
Did she ask you?
It's over there
but why are you going there?
To pray.
- Wait, you can't go there now.
Why?
The prayers are called off?
I'm not supposed to tell.
We're busy. Please go.
Please listen to him.
He is an intelligence policeman.
Govind is inside.
He's a dreaded terrorist.
You are interfering with surveillance.
Go away, please.
Aren't there others on surveillance?
- He's a one man army!
His sister is marrying next month and
I'm Prabhu And he isn't even armed.
There's one man behind the house
And the entire battalion is coming.
Have you any more to tell?
Are you my publicist?
Madam, please leave us.
Come back for prayers later.
Your wife name is Mary?
How come you know Mary?
The tattoo on your arm.
Oh, this was when I was young.
My wife's name now is Laxmi.
Then, Mary is your girlfriend?
Don't ask embarrassing questions.
Mary isn't your wife?
No.
Even, I did it on my body.
Now, can't remove it. Look.
Give it, Grandma.
Wash your hands with antiseptic.
It's a virus.
I shall first ask God.
You wait here.
What which god?
- Out of my way.
Move.
Mad cow.
- What was that?
Nothing. I said I go to your God.
- Only after you.
God wait, don't go away.
This thing listen.
Grandma, go inside. You'll fall
- Want to go to the God.
If you fall down, you'll go to Him.
- I'm going to him.
Lord, You know what this is?
- Grandma, come back!
What are you?
- Sorry.
Govindaraja, this is some germ bomb.
You're the Saviour.
Keep this with you.
Don't fall down and break something.
Get down from there.
Mind that box!
- Don't drop me.
Bless you all.
Heavy traffic, so took the fly-over.
- Stop joking! Where's the vial?
How could you lose it?
I didn't lose it. I give it to God.
- To that God?
And He'll give...
- This god?
For safe-keeping.
- Goodness!
One minute.
- It's inside Him.
What why do you stop us?
- What do you want?
Wait please....
- Don't stand before God wearing shoe.
A vial is inside it. The chip is inside!
- No fields or values in this town.
Don't disturb go away.
- Not values... A vial.
Go and sit in your place.
Is the suspect Govind in that area?
Narayana... good God.
Who's throwing stones?
Press the button and talk
Is Govind there or not?
Bullshit! You're the idiot.
Govind went in search of God.
What's this like a swollen cell phone?
- What's a swollen?
Why hasn't the monastery come yet?
- We're coming to it.
Put it away.
Ekambaram, where are you?
No need to panic.
There is a terrorist in your midst.
Everybody stands still
until arrest him.
What, mister?
Hey, Govind!
You and your assistants.
Christian Fletcher and the girl.
Surrender at once.
By the count of ten.
One.
Two.
Goodness, God!
My God!
Good God!
My head is spinning.
Where are we taking the bus to?
- Who knows?
Slow down.
Not in my hands.
- The bus is. Let go.
Let go?
Yes!
Let go of it!
Don't scream into my ears.
Open your eyes and get in.
Look at what you're getting into.
I've never even gotten into a moving bus.
Astrologically, water is dangerous for me.
This is train not water.
There must be water in the train?
What are you talking?
- What if we come to a bridge over train?
Get in before it comes.
Give me the God.
Why did you steal my God?
I didn't steal. I'm trying
to save everyone, including you.
Savior of Gods!
Look at you.
The policeman said that
you're a terrorist.
What do you mean?
- An extremist, terrorist.
I'm no terrorist.
Swear by you.
Don't touch me.
Okay, swear by your god.
- Don't touch the idol!
Who knows what caste you are?
What is your dad's name?
Why now?
Okay, Ramasamy.
- O.K. Ramasamy?
Not O.K. Just Ramasamy Naicker.
Oh, the atheist?
Don't come near me! Keep away!
My dad wasn't an atheist.
Just an artiste.
Artiste?
- Musician. A renowned musician.
Good. But you're getting too close.
Go.
Your god thinks that stinking toilet
is holier than me?
Why didn't you tell me
there's a sauchalayam?
Sauchalayam?
- Toilet.
Bathroom! That's a room as well.
Use it.
Don't mock God.
Isn't the vial inside?
The sower shall be made to cheap.
- This time, it'll be the grim reaper.
So. I'm telling you to
give me the vial.
Don't shake!
Remove it carefully with your finger.
- Can't do it with finger.
Then, lets find an axe.
You wretch!
You think he's timber?
He's Lord Govindaraja.
He is my God!
Exactly! He is God!
- Not him.
The train is slowing down.
Let's get off.
- In motion?
With the idol? Never.
- You say no to everything.
What do you want me to do?
The white guy will kill us.
Which white guy?
- Take a look.
That jeep.
God! Let go.
What happened?
That's my God!
Lord Govindaraja, forgive me.
- Okay, you're forgiven.
Give it.
-  Won't!
I won't give.
- Let me.
Give it, please.
Stop!
If you touch me or my God.
I'm not interested in touching you.
I want the stuff inside.
And a rapist too?
- What?
Our God, Protector of women
will protect me.
Watch it.
Look....
There's light.
A farmer's hearth.
Do you know what a farmer is. A toiler,
with a tough body.
He'll fix you!
Brother, help!
Get out!
- I'm a ready out in the open.
Farmer, help!
There is your tough body
but I'm sure if it's a farmer.
Stop, you'll scare yourself.
- I'm not scared.
Did they burn him alive? He is trying
to stand up. What on earth is it?
A half-burnt corpse tends to jerk.
- Jerk?
Due to heat.
The idol should not be here.
Oh yes, it's an unholy place.
- No. It's the heat.
The vial inside...
- Oh! Yes, let's go.
Will you please demount and walk?
How dare you carry me!
- What?
I mean the idol.
Come along!
For safety sake.
It become so dark suddenly?
- The earth is rotating, you see.
Watch your step.
What are you up to?
Oh. It's wet here.
What have you done?
- I did nothing. The sand is wet.
I can put the idol in here.
Not in wet sand?
He’ll catch a fever?
Don't be silly.
Silly you!
Burying a watch in the sand.
Pass him.
- No, I won't.
If the vial leaks,
not just you and I, the whole state will
be wiped out in 48 hours.
Is it a germ-bomb?
- Yes.
Like Anthrax on Discovery Channel?
Somewhat similar.
Give it, please.
- Okay.
Wait.
- Now what?
May good occur to those
who bear goodwill for others in heart.
And blessings be upon those...
Who preach that goodness.
Don't say sorry to me.
God. I'm sorry.
Forgive me, Lord Narayana.
Let the idol remain here.
Let's see if can find any ice nearby.
Why ice?
So, God doesn't heat up.
You stay here.
Wait! All alone
Near a pyre?
What about God?
I'll go and you stay.
Get two or three kilos of ice.
Come along.
- But your God?
Who need to look after God?
We'll tell the police first.
They'll look after the rest.
God damn ice.
Curse my luck.
We aren't even connected by a long shot.
You bury the idol and I get punished.
Hey, wait!
Wait, where will you find ice?
Look, stop dragging me all over the place.
Sir, do you have ice?
I don't see rice here.
Not rice. Ice, ice.
- Quiet. I'll ask him.
The thing over there.
Are you kidding me?
I'm not deaf.
I couldn't hear because of those
lorries noise.
What iced drink do you want?
Not drinks. Just give me ice
worth a hundred dollars.
You take me for a pawnbroker?
- It'll fetch you 4.500 bucks
Not for Rs 4.500.
I'll give for Rs. 25 max. Agreed?
This is so unfair.
You think I run a bank?
Okay. I'll give ice for Rs. 35.
Why are you crying for ice?
I'll give it to you.
Wait, I go to break the chunk of ice.
- Okay.
Are you a baby?
- I've ice only for Rs. 10.
Just give me whatever you have.
Why are you crying?
- Look down there.
It's filthy.
- Tea shops are like that.
Man, the tv.
- Damn! All important cricket

May have a Brahmin lover named Andal.
The investigating officer...
- Mr. Balram Naidu has revealed!
Why does he reveal all this?
- Damn him!
I was fine where was. With a germ-bomb
parcel, you destroyed my life.
Now, you've made laughing stock of me!
How did make laughing stock of you?
Seems like you're crying?
- You dare to joke?
Don't ever spit on me like that.
I'm not married yet!
- So. you'll spit?
Tell me a way out.
My marriage broker will ask
for explanations.
How will l explain?
What am I going to do?
Say it's all gossip.
Say we are just....
Just friends?
You think I'm a film actress?
I'm from an orthodox family.
You've brought me to the streets.
You go.
Shall I put it in a bag?
- Yes.
They drive like they are blind.
Sand in my eyes.
They are blind.
But they see money in sand.
I've seen millions of sand
lorries rob the lands.
You think they'll take sand near
the Chola temple?
They've encroached as far as the bridge.
What's a temple!
Oh, no.
Someone has kidnapped my daughter.
Investigate that first.
You want to grill Grandma instead?
What happened?
- The vehicle is ready.
The bonnet is dented,
but the jeep runs.
You understood?
- Not a damn thing.
It means we must go now.
Grandma is very old.
Grandma is mentally unstable.
She can't take an inquest.
She's pushing 95.
- She doesn't have to push anything.
The vehicle is ready. You don't get it?
- Sir, you don't get it?
We are not criminals.
This is a monastery, mind it!
So what? Why won't there be criminals
inside a monastery?
I suspect each and every one of you.
I'll investigate.
Ours is very reputed clan.
Several families live in America.
But we've no connection with the
American terrorist. We're very religious.
We know nothing.
Please stop.
Do you know about our Azhagiya Singer?
You mean the pretty singer?
Madonna?
- God damn!
Our singers are talented.
But they are not as glamorous.
But why all this now?
- You started this.
What did I start?
- Azhagiya Singer is our guru, high priest.
Yes.
- He's away in Delhi.
How will face him when he returns?
Promise her rose milk.
She'll go. She's nuts.
Or, say that her dead son has returned.
She'll go anywhere you want.
Go inside, you little brat!
The dead son's name?
- Aravamudan.
Your son.
Aravamudan?
- Yes.
Aravamudan.
- Yes, my son.
He has bought lots of rose milk and
is waiting.
Meet him, drink rose milk and
answer to my questions.
Come along.
- Okay, lets go.
Load the lorry.
Tell them in Tamil.
Hey, who are you?
Where are you going?
My stuff is stuck inside
.
Inside the sand.
- My God.
Tell them to stop.
- You stop first.
Hey! Off the engine.
- Off it.
Let them come.
Are you guys activist?
No, I'm just a pacifist.
He's the terrorist.
Will you shut up?
- You shut up.
We buried the idol
of Lord Govindarajan here.
Are you making up a tale?
- I swear, it's true.
It was on tv.
He's a popular terrorist.
No, I'm a scientist.
I hardly know her.
What are you up to in a crematorium?
Black magic?
What have you done?
- What?
He's a terrorist.
We'll get 25 million if we hand him over.
He's the one.
It's my photo in the papers.
See? He's in the papers.
You didn't believe me? He's the one.
You wretch!
- Wait.
Let me have the deity.
You can keep him.
Lady, I'd prefer it vice versa.
- Oh, boy...
I didn't mean that.
We keep 25 million,
the police keeps this guy. But wait.
My boy!
- Yes, brother.
If this lady complains about us when
we turn this guy in, will they listen?
What complaint?
- If she says
A fat contractor,
his bearded assistant
And his lorry drivers raped me.
Will they believe?
- No way.
If you want money, turn
us in to the police.
If you lay your fingers on her,
I don't know what I'll do then.
What will you do?
Look behind you.
Hold him, guys.
I love this game.
You can shout, you can scream, you can
even scratch my back with your nails.
What are you gaping at?
Showing a movie here?
Off the headlights!
Switch on the damn temple lights,
you fools!
Come, lady!
You fat slobs!
Catch her. Run.
Stop, lady!
Let go!
Please let me go!
Careful, cactus.
Takes you so long to pin
him down?
Rascals, scoundrels! Ok, sorry brothers.
- Let's go, baby.
Don't you have sisters?
- Who said so?
I got a sister, mother, wife.
What don't have is this You come.
Somebody help me.
My point I'll help you
I'll keep you.
Lord Narayana!
For the first time
on Indian television,
Footage shown never before.
Uncensored.
A must for all the family audiences.
A rape scene.
Hold this.
Ain't talking about the girl.
I'm talking about our mother Earth.
Everyone sings praises of mother Earth.
Now watch her getting raped.
The rape of this girl is a sideshow.
If you've done it once, it comes easily.
I know who they work for.
They deserve to know, too.
Tell them.
JaRa: Ja Raghavender
They work for him.
A riverbeds have been scrapped
till the clay shows.
Thanks to these whoresons who don't care
if the world is destroyed.
Look. Take a photo of it.
You got that?
That's a 12th century Chola temple
and they don't respect that.
Look.
That's a graveyard for the Dalits.
They've no respect for that either.
A 3 day old grave will be dug out,
the dead discarded.
The sand quarried.
I ask for justice.
And what does JaRa do?
Frames me as an anti-social,
throws me in jail.
But you can't jail the truth.
Why have you brought a crowd?
You touch an untouchable when it suits you!
Hands off me!
Who knows what shit you've
on your hands digging sand?
Shall we talk to the village council?
Council? It's a kangaroo court.
What's there to talk?
You dogs shit on the plates that feed you.
What's the point talking to you?
In his lust, a mercenary trader won't know
between a mother and a sister.
One's whore and another's wife.
Only when someone like me reminds you,
are you likely to realize.
Are you shooting. SunTV?
Your name?
- Go away!
If my face appears on tv,
there will be murder.
Murder?
You may own a thousand trucks
and benchmen, but turn around.
Millions are seeing through the camera.
Murdering millions is a tall talk
even for your thousands.
It's the people's voice.
Don't try to shut it away.
If you can, shut your trap
and cover your rear.
Boovaragan.
- Yes.
I'll tell the boss.
You're going to be destroyed.
You'll dig and the earth is destroyed.
And I'm asking why you do it.
We will do it.
We have permit.
A permit issued in whose name,
JaRa's, his wife Gajalaxmi's?
Or his mistress? What's her name?
- Meenakshi.
Don't you dare call my sister a mistress!
You are Meenakshi's sibling?
No, I'm her elder brother.
Stupid, it's the same either way.
Show me the permit.
Can you read it?
How many can read in your crowd?
Which era do you live in?
You won't find an unlettered man among us.
Not counting me.
- You're an unlettered genius.
Is that so?
All right.
We have geniuses and lettered
geniuses
Here, Kapilan. How learned are you?
- M.A. M Phil.
He writes songs for movies.
He'll put down my tirade in a song.
Tell him your poem on pebbles.
Sands,
the offspring of pebbles.
Cut sandbanks,
you cut off our babies' babble.
Yes, unlike cutting hair.
At least, hair grows back.
Proceed.
Enough. A grain of rice tells
how well the pot is cooking.
But his pot is big.
More.
Renounce robbery,
Return the stolen sands.
If stealing still continues,
Hack him into two pieces.
Well said!
If you change the soil like meat,
where will our girls play.
Where will migrating birds nest
and our children build their castles.
He steals eggs from their nests.
Hey, get him!
Don't let him out of sight.
- Where can he go?
We have it all on camera.
- Got him.
Where is the nearest police station?
- How do I know?
But it's your hometown?
You have exported me!
First a fruit cart, bus, train. Now lorry.
Take me to Chidambaram.
Take your hand off your cheek
and drive.
Still hurts. She hit me.
An ice pack will do you good.
- But she hit me with an ice pack!
Shut up and chase.
You think I'll get scared
if you drive it like a flying saucer?
Out of the way.
- What's the hurry?
You didn't read in the papers?
The American terrorist is escaping.
Which terrorist?
Dr. Govind and his Brahmin girlfriend?
Yes! I was the first to identify them.
- Is that important now? Move aside.
Pondicherry 20km on that sign.
- We'll find a police station here.
My God won't go there.
His place is Chidambaram.
He is supposed to be everywhere.
Why not Pondicherry?
Do not scorn.
If we're alive, it's only because of Him.
Turn around to Chidambaram.
Why tell me? Tell your god.
He will turn us around.
God. thank You.
Thank You, Father.
Hold this.
Faster.
Why did you switch off the lights?
Saving electricity.
Shut up or get up?
- Whatever up.
Up now, please!
- What a Tamil!
Filthy sack!
You've no respect for God?
I've much respect.
But if we flash his gold and diamonds at
midnight, someone might mug us.
Give Him to me.
Let's check out that van.
- What I am now, a mechanic?
Allah!
Taking my God to Chidambaram
is important.
People are more important for me.
You stay here.
This leg is stuck. Somebody help!
Hei, Yusuf, come out.
Watch it.
Easy on that leg.
Salim, where are you?
I'm here, dad.
Come out.
- Can't, my leg is stuck.
Your leg too?
Is it broken?
Not broken.
Stuck in a slushy hole.
Baby! Where's Baby?
- A baby is missing?
I see a head. There's someone here.
- I see a leg.
Someone is here.
Head, leg, all belong to the same baby.
Baby, come out.
Baby, come on.
Come out.
What’s this?
He will feel bad.
Hope nothing is wrong with you?
Oh. I'm just a bit tall.
A bit?
I've been calling you forever,
why don't you answer?
I would but little brother's foot
was stuck and
I felt like puking.
His foot was stuck.
You could have yelled.
His foot was stuck in my mouth.
Your mouth?
I thought it's a big hole.
Yes, I do talk a lot.
My legs are aching.
Thanks be to Allah, nobody is hurt.
- Thanks be.
It has stopped, dad.
Watch your step.
Brother. help daddy. He's unsteady.
- I’ll take care of dad.
Who are you?
- I'm Kalif Ullah. This is my family.
How did this happen to you?
- A lorry hit us.
A lorry hit and you become tall?
See that Lorries.
One of them hit our van.
Why are we hiding?
- Wait.
Boss, this van. This lorry,
dash-dashed and rolled down.
How do you know what I stepped on?
You're a genius.
Why are we hiding?
- Quiet! I'm listening.
Investigating suspicious circumstances.
You guys wait on the highway.
Who are you? Why are you here?
Why is the van parked like that?
A lorry driver hit us.
Who hit you?
The lorry or the driver?
Keep quiet!
A lorry driver hit us.
Your family?
- Yes.
And this lighthouse?
My son.
- The little boy?
He is my son too.
You're sure? Even that one?
- Why do you doubt?
Doubting is our job.
- And that girl?
Will you shut up?
Was a sand carrier hit you?
Sand or gold, never saw.
All know is, a lorry hit us.
This man... Where is he?
This man and his wife saved us.
Who and whose wife?
- Is it important?
Did you look inside the lorry?
- Yes. There was a man.
And a boy.
What hush-hush?
- You're a girl, I assure you.
How can you say that!
- Okay, you're neither. Drop it.
Did he look like a terrorist?
What -ist?
- What terror?
Did he look like a terrorist?
Yes, sir!
You do look like a terrorist.
Not me. The other guy!
Damn! Start the car.
- Right away, sir.
Wait... Lorry number?
- What's the lorry number?
Lorry number is
Wait, I'm coming.
I'm sorry for you guys.
Is anyone hurt?
By Allah's grace, no one is hurt.
We're on a criminal-chase.
Wait. I'll send a tow truck.
Hit the siren.
- Sir! Your name, sir?
My name is Balram Naidu.
Let's go.
You're leaving your wife behind?
Holy water.
- Grandma wants holy water.
Holy water?
- Yes.
Mineral water, sir.
- Oh.
Don't drink too much. We'll have to look
for bathrooms. I'm on a chase.
Holy water, holy smoke.
Is there an accelerator?
Yes.
- Step on it.
If only you'd stop chattering.
I'd have caught up with him.
Who's catching whom now?
Shoe.
- If I'm shoe, you are sock.
Yes, you're like shoe and sock.
Perfect pairing.
Even you.
You saved us.
Like me. You shall beget many children.
Sons like him, daughters like you.
Insha Allah!
What rubbish!
At sundown, I'm your lover.
By night, I'm your wife.
Now, she's my midwife!
Next what, immaculate Conception?
Never look a gift horse in the mouth.
- What gift? What horse?
She is. If not for them.
Fletcher would have killed us.
Who the hell is Fletcher?
He was chasing the train.
- Didn't see.
He was here minutes ago.
- You wouldn't even let me see.
The man you didn't see
is Fletcher CIA.
Goodness! Allah!
- What's it, dad?
Blood! Whose blood is this?
- What's up?
What happened? Wife!
You care for everyone, you don't take care.
Stop the car!
Step aside.
- Okay.
Hold this.
Goodness, my saree is blood-stained
- Don't worry.
My sister's dress will fit you.
Noor Jehan, give her a dress.
Sir, you can wear my brother's clothes.
That's not important.
- No, sir.
For the help you've done,
I'd give you all our wealth.
But my dad has already
given away everything.
What left is little.
It's cancer and you have
neglected it.
Immediate surgery is needed.
Chances are, your vocal chords
will be affected.
Meaning....?
The choices are....
One. I can avoid surgery. Live and sing
another five or six months...
After five or six months.
Let me say it.
The other choice....
I get operated. Lose my voice
and live another 15 or 20 years.
Is that it?
- Bluntly speaking, yes.
God be praised!
Song is my life. Won't give it up.
Is what you'd expect me to say?
I would have said so if
I had not meet her.
If I didn't love her.
But I do.
That's my problem.
Singing is not my life.
It's my profession.
She my family.
Is life. For their sake,
need life.
The sooner you get operated,
the better it's for you.
Today's performance.
Might be my last by God's grace.
This nurse will accompany you.
To provide immediate medication
if you feel pain or bleed.
Your medicines are in the box.
Give a great performance
and head straight for surgery.
We know the blood group,
Keep the operation theatre ready.
As soon as we find blood,
we'll operate.
Relatives? You know about the surgery?
- Yes, doctor.
Please save my wife.
Do the surgery.
It's a rare blood group.
Once we find the blood,
we'll proceed.
Doctor. use my blood.
Who are you?
- My blood.
She needs blood.
- He's my blood and hers.
Is he AB+ve?
- All the blood in me is hers.
Take 5, 10, 70, liters.
As much as you want.
That happens only in our movies.
I must test your blood.
Who are you?
This must be kept in a cool dry place.
Everything in this hospital is yours!
Just ask.
And me?
- One signature is enough.
Out of my way, I'll take it.
- You think packed it for you?
Patience, after I donate blood.
we'll go to the police station together.
Why must go to the police station?
It's nothing, brother.
Her brother is a police inspector.
Good.
Brother in law.
No, brother.
Your?
- No, hers. Brother.
For you, her brother is...
- Oh, you get him?
What?
- Your brother, my brother in law.
Brahmins say wife's brother differently.
- Whose wife's brother?
Mine.
Your brother,
his police inspector!
It's all working out,
you understand?
Neither does he.
Put it down.
It can roll on its wheels.
Put it down, sir.
What's inside is precious.
Please don't get me wrong.
How could get you wrong?
You and I are to become blood relations.
- When and how?
You're giving blood to my mother.
- Oh, that.
A million thanks to you and your husband.
- Don't mention it.
You think we're man and wife?
I see! You're lovers
Eloping to marry.
I'll explain it all to the brother in law.
- Brother in law?
Your brother. The police inspector?
- No!
Correct.
- What's correct?
What incorrect to you, is correct.
We need not to tell mother about this.
Stop! It's getting more confused.
Let's put an end to it.
Make way.
- Step aside.
Mr. Kalaful ah...
- Kalif Ullah.
Fulla whatever!
Do you know that he is a.... ?
I'm inspector Barath.
He's the scientist who saved my life.
For you, maybe.
He's taking out mine.
Will you be quiet?
No, lady, you're wrong.
Actually, he's a hero.
Thank the heroes and villains later.
You're donating blood,
saving lives.
But not letting for surgery.
Who are you?
I'm an innocent.
Inspector, everyone is after me.
Save me.
Mr. Innocent, we have to save him first.
He's got a bullet in the hip.
Govind, your photos are in tv and papers.
- I know.
Bad pictures. Out of focus.
- Quiet, please?
Don't get caught. The local cops
will beat the day lights out of you.
Go to the police headquarters.
I'll tell Mr. Naidu to meet you
Balram Naidu of RAW.
Don't forget.
Your cell phone please, I'll tell Naidu.
- No, first an anesthetic.
The brother in law.
It's true then?
Yes, his friend.
- Yes.
Brother in law is in the
police station.
Yes.
- Balram Naidu.
How do you know Balram Naidu?
- You said so.
I said so?
Quiet!
If Naidu is your brother in law,
you're Telugu.
But you speak Tamil well.
Of course!
Ramasamy Naicker is Telugu!
Which Naicker?
Your father Naicker. Isn't he?
- Yes, my dad is... oh no!
You'll give me a blood clot.
I'd rather donate blood. Wait.
Is there a phone nearby?
- Payphones at the receptions.
But, haven't got change.
Do we need money to call police?
- No need.
You don't know Tamil?
So. I'm using English.
Idol means.
- Know, The Lord.
There's a vial, isn't it? Take it.
Give me my God.
Where is the statue?
- In the ice-box.
Carry a cell phone.
Yusuf will take you to the police.
Sir, come... please.
- Let's go.
How wonderful!
I greet you in God's name.
Sir....
- Yes.
It's too crowded.
Better leave from the basement.
Well, let's take the back exit.
I want to be as tall as he is.
- Why do you want to be so tall?
What's happening to you?
God.
Nurse, get the ice-box.
You take the kids along.
Avtaar Singh, are you okay?
- Perfect.
I'll sit in front,
you take the rear seat.
Quickly, please.
Where is he?
Govind and I were taking the idol
to the police station.
I gave him my cell phone turn back
for Yusuf and he's gone.
I think he went to the police station.
Who is he?
- Christian Fletcher, CIA.
We have met already.
Of course, he's tall.
Noticeable.
220 centimeters.
A little.
Little?
I thought big.
Mosquito?
In Japanese, "thank you" is Do Ma?
In Telugu, doma means mosquito.
Govind, where are you?
You haven't gone in?
If you want your fiancee,
the Brahmin lover Andal alive,
Return with the ice box.
Shall tell you the address?
He isn't coming!
I'm certain.
I'm not his moll.
He isn't my lover.
Ya Allah!
The two of you eloped to marry.
Why are you changing your mind now?
Stop guessing!
I saw him for the first time today.
And you have already got
us hitched.
He will not come.
It is him.
- Not him.
What if it's him?
- Then, I'll marry him! Fine?
Don't tell me that, tell him.
- He won't come.
Govind Uncle is here.
Andal, don't worry.
Sit.
Your future husband has come.
They say marriages are made in heaven.
But I think, your marriage
will happen there.
8 bullets.
Looks like everyone is going
to the wedding.
Salim. Salim.
Don't worry, you saved my mother.
It's my duty to save your life.
Go.
Salim, don't worry.
Our brother and his wife will
take care of you.
I will take care of
the police.
Nothing will happen to you.
Insha Allah!
Stop! Why are you closing the door?
Open the door.
Aha! The Lighthouse!
Come out, come.
I couldn't make out your height when
You stood at the pit.
Go inside. The terrorist is
in this house that Fletcher.
Yes, boss.
Hey, who are you?
- Kumar.
What are you doing here?
- Taking a leak.
Halt.
Who's in there?
- No one, you can take a look.
I'm going.
Why are you hitting me?
A constable is lying dead.
A white man, three others and a boy
have escaped.
From which house did they escape?
The tailor's shop.
By the back door.
They escaped through the back alley.
Late news.
It was on radio yesterday.
Are you ISI? Lashkar-e-Toiba?
Or?
Al Qaeda?
- Yes, that.
I'm non, sir.
How can one be non?
In an Afghani outfit?
Tall like a ladder.
What's your name?
Bin Ladder?
Don't ridicule me, sir.
My name is Kalif Ullah.
That's why you're full, ah?
Seal the street. Everyone in the street
must be questioned.
The entire street, sir?
- Yes, yes.
Some 200 people must live down the lane.
- So, what?
First, question the odd ones.
Damn!
They are all terrorists.
Don't think that everyone who prays
towards the Mecca is a terrorist.
My father has donated his lands
to public cause.
We may be poor now.
You see the mosque there?
My father gave the land it stands upon.
You can ask anyone.
You gave land, you gave help
and now you've given me an idea.
You want to interrogate 200 men?
Round them up, stuff them in the mosque.
No one should come out.
Boss, why did you push me out?
Hey, how can you ditch me!
Turn around.
Hair-breath escape!
Can you stop, please?
- Grandma! Why did you get in?
We are chasing.
When did you get in?
At Chidambaram. I'm bursting.
Stop it!
Can't stop! Don't squeeze her.
- Not him. My bladder.
Oh that! I can't stop.
Control it.
Excretion must be let out.
Stop the jeep!
Spit a little out of the window
- What he's blabbering!
Look, this is my son's photo.
Take me to him.
What's happening to you?
Dad, take the kids outside.
Mom, don't worry. Go outside.
Nurse, give him the medicine.
- We don't have the medicine.
But we brought it along.
- It's the wrong box.
We'll tell them you're unwell.
- No, Ranjita.
God is testing me.
How much faith Avaatar has in Him.
Lord, bless my way.
In the time of deed,
May I never wave.
Give me the confidence
To win always.
Wasn't it green?
We have spotted Fletcher's jeep.
Oh! Spotted? Where?
Outside the Avtaar Singh show.
Do you know where the show is?
- Behind us
Turn around.
Are they looking for trouble?
- Let's see.
You don't go.
We'll sort it out.
Old man, why you fall at my feet,
You have no respect for age?
Yes, tell me now.
- Why fall at my feet?
Don't you have respect for age?
Nowadays, it's not relevant.
We aren't here to make trouble.
Today is JaRa's son's birthday.
It's your God's birthday, too.
On this auspicious day.
JaRa wants to beg your pardon.
Many thanks.
Our God and your drugs change places.
Your box is here.
What's going on here?
Hey, let go off my boss!
Oh, no! Call the doctor, please.
Boy, give me the cotton.
Where are you going?
Get on.
Come, junior. He has come to wish you
on your birthday.
Greetings!
I wish you a good health and wealth
for a long life ahead.
That's fine.
Where is my present?
You mustn’t ask!
- Son, like father.
Give him a pen.
Forgive him. He's just a boy
- But he has asked.
My birthday is next month.
Welcome Boovaragan!
Come here.
Can we talk in private?
Shall I?
Wait. After three hours of
discussion.
Do you want to return
empty handed?
My men are waiting.
They haven't eaten.
Got to get home and eat
an honest meal.
No one is waiting for anyone.
After four rounds of drinks.
they are eating.
Look.
The few who haven't eaten,
will soon be tempted.
Are you not content with destroying
the land, now you destroy men?
Then, you'll destroy the Earth?
And then, the Moon?
You'll even go to the moon.
Not even an atom bomb will kill you?
You cockroach!
Talk respectly.
Mother Earth demands the same
respect.
To rob the riverbank is a crime.
Treason!
Against the Earth!
We have only one home,
this world.
Where will you go after you've
destroyed it all?
Stop talking about the world!
Who are you to save the world?
Hero of the universe?
Yes, little brother.
I'm that hero.
Not only me.
Every one sperm of the 40 millions
that survives, comes to life...
Is a hero of the universe.
But not everyone thinks that way.
Like you, some would rather
live as happy as worm in filth.
I wish you a long wriggling life!
I'm leaving.
Boovaragan, wait.
Watch this before you go.
If the vial cracks, what
scale of danger are we looking at?
I don't know Telugu.
Let me say it in Tamil.
The nullifier is. NaCl.
That's the Tamil Chemistry that
know, NaCl.
If the vial falls in the wrong hands.
what is the next step?
Backdoor?
Sorry, not to you.
So NaCl... this isn't opening.
How much NaCl is needed?
If it cracks, mountain-loads will be
needed. Tones and tones of NaCl.
Everyone will perish.
Hurry up!
Help me!
Andal!
Give me my God!
Let go.
Don't give it to him!
What's this?
A police station?
They've thrown in the whole neighborhood
for questioning.
This is atrocious.
And you do nothing!
Calm down. Allah will take
care of us.
I look you for a good man. And you
gave the idol to that villain?
Only the idol is with him.
Vial is with me.
Your God will be fine.
But if something happens to this?
- How did you get it?
What?
Where are we going?
Please, trust me.
- I trust you.
You are really a hero!
Is there a lab or a
hospital nearby?
For pregnant women or animals, madam?
- He's the one asking.
Go straight, turn left.
Why are you hugging us?
Didn't I tell?
Before entering inside,
you rub in salt?
Yes, we do.
That's the virus-killer,
NaCl. Sodium Chloride.
Drop it in the pile.
- Not enough. We need more.
Where's the sea?
- The sea....
Walk along here, to the other side.
- Not other side, just the opposite.
My Lord!
Your India is Great!
Stop!
Stop. Fletcher!
You will die!
Yuka.
Yuka is dead.
Now, he dies for Yuka.
Are you allright?
Hey, Fletcher!
Good God!
You can say that again.
Oh, God!
Tsunami, run!
If we want our kids to lead
better lives than ours,
We have to feed on others.
Even your men will swear that your
death was an accident.
Your corpse and your men corpses
will float without any scars.
You can still change your mind, what say?
- Only one thing. Kill me.
Not my men.
They have families.
Then die a filthy death.
Filthy?
I'm dying for the Earth.
But yours will be filthier.
Daddy, save me.
My son!
Save my son.
Boovaragan, don't abandoned my son.
My son!
What catastrophe has Allah
brought upon us?
The idol...
Give me my idol.
God has saved everyone.
You call that saving?
God does nothing without
a reason.
We are the ones who rave
without rhyme or reason.
Oh, God!
You gave life to the thief.
A son born to a chaste mother died alone.
In raging floods, fell a banyan tree.
Sing songs of Earth heartily, you said.
I sing in praise and you're dead.
The maddened sea rocked a mountain.
Yours is a good death.
We live to decay and die.
My son. My son!
Try to understand.
Your son is dead 50 years ago.
Grandma, idol! The Lord.
- He isn't the one. Go away.
My son is there.
He's there.
The darkest skin, the fairiest heart.
You're the son of our warrior God.
Grandma, I can't take the deity
near a corpse.
What you said is true.
My son is dead!
No, he isn't your son.
Your son was fair-skinned
Fairest at heart.
It's the salt
and sunlight what’ve made him dark.
Don't touch. You don't know his caste.
Shut up, you fanatic!
He is my son.
The only son born to
Krishnaveni and Srinivasan.
Born in Uthiradam Star, Pieces.
He was born at 8 in the night,
the Lord takes him at 8 in the morning.
My dear, you forget there's an old woman
waiting for you?
In so many years,
you didn't even write a letter?
You kept sending me parcels.
Hold this for me,
Grandma.
Don't. It's 50 years of sadness.
Let her cry now.
Our savior...
He rescued my child.
If you're man enough,
touch his feet. Beg his pardon.
O, Lord, has my son reached
Your abode?
Take me there too.
Kalif Ullah!
If 200 of us had not been
in the mosque,
even we would be in heaven.
All by Allah's mercy.
- Allah is great!
Mr. Avaatar, you are safe.
Even our surgeons
couldn't have done a better job.
The bullet missed your voice box,
and took your cancerous growth.
Hereafter, only simple treatments
like chemotherapy will be needed.
Don't be afraid.
Look, your relatives have come.
Don't be afraid. Turn and see.
Take him closer.
You see. It's all His work.
- His work?
Thousand of corpses, his handwork?
- Your virus would have killed millions.
So, this is a change?
Fantastic.
8 millions years ago, God intentionally
let the tectonic plates glide.
So that he could save us with a tsunami
from the virus I make in 2004.
Instead, could He have stopped planting
such idea in scientist's minds?
Or He could have changed the minds of men
like Bush who financed this? Instead?
Oh, forget it!
Your grandma and your god,
just not there.
Look, I don't know what it is
but for some reason
God has created a kind of feeling for you.
- What kind?
Forget it.
- Forget what?
Don't argue like this!
- I'm arguing?
I don't like it when you say
things like there's no God.
Nothing of the sort will happen for us.
- What sort?
That's exactly what I don't like!
- What do you dislike?
If you argue over everything,
our lives will be in a mess.
Why should our lives be in a mess?
If God wills, he'll devise new designs.
There you go if ever again you
ridicule God or deny Him,
There's no way we'll come together.
Think and let me know.
What's there to think about?
We've come together.
We have got to be together.
But please never again say,
there's no God.
When did ever say,
there's no God.
It'll be good if there's one.
Accept the fact.
Until a majority attains rational logic.
The debate over the existence of God,
will continue.
Till then, I am only willing to accept
arguments honorable to human society.
I now invite the honorable Chief Minister
to make his speech.
