In the summer of 1960,
throughout Finland shocked
the brutal murder of Bodom Lake.
Four teenagers were assaulted,
while they slept in their tent.
The killer is still at large.
In the course of time arose
many theories of Bodom-mystery
and what actually happened
that fateful night.
This film is inspired
of these stories.
Reach?
-They are coming.
-Both?
-You Do well not joking with me?
-No.
Do you have them?
They are too big.
-They Are too big!
-It's My mother you're talking about.
But wait.
-What are you doing?
-Look here.
It's the same sting.
Imagine lda in here.
-Yes, Lda?
-Do I go out?
Where?
Nora is a sweet girl.
She is a harlot.
Have you already forgotten?
The entire family is ashamed of the girl.
lda-Maria, sit.
I'm not a dog.
What did you say?
I'm not a dog.
Let her go.
You can go.
Stay there.
Be careful mother.
-What Are you doing with the ax?
-For Your mother.
To make her prettier.
Give it to me.
So you need a bigger ax.
It is true.
I do not know how you
persuaded them. A reconstruction?
You can say that.
But we both get what we want.
Now they are here.
Are you completely sure?
Yes.
We were of course agree.
Did you hear that?
lda, you have not been anywhere
for half a year
You have been invisible.
What happened with you,
was terrible.
But together we are stronger.
Is not that right?
In this weekend
we forget all the rubbish.
lda.
This is your new start.
God, you're beautiful.
-You Just need a little makeup.
-But They are waiting for us.
And...?
I heard that Nora's father
took his own life in the basement..
He hanged himself.
Think.
Do not talk about the kind
when they are here.
I mean it.
Now they come.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Let me help.
-Hi! I can help.
-What A gentleman.
-Have L told anyone about this?
- What, you think we'd be here?
It makes no sense.
-What? That's the way it is!
-Is Everything okay, if you do not get caught?
No. We are talking about
two completely different things.
Girls and boys.
Love and sex.
-How You get those two things?
-It's Two pair.
In any case, boys
other needs than girls ...
-Now You are in deep water.
-Do I have a word out?
The point is that boys want sex,
and girls want love.
The need is equal,
but it turns out in various ways
I actually think,
you have a point.
Boys should have different rules
in relationships.
The laws of nature
In its purest forms.
-You Do not look convinced.
-No.
-Why not?
-Why?
-Yes.
-Because This is nonsense.
That a woman could not be
complete without a man.
Or would have sex like a man.
So you want sex?
Do not you want love?
I'm changing teams.
We stand by the chauvinists.
Are the other already?
Part.
The rest comes tomorrow.
-Hi!
What the hell did you say to them?
How do you think I got them to
come? Your charisma is doing is not everything.
Fucking idiot ...
-Lyt.
-To what?
The silence
Right this way.
What is this place?
Elias, you had the ax.
-We Do not hurry.
-HYTTEN Better be good.
Damn ...
Devil take your bags.
Why we stopped?
It is here.
-It Must be here.
-What?
-I do not say anything.
Where's the cabin?
There is no cabin.
Sorry.
Sit down,
I will explain.
What? Lied to us?
-Pas Right on!
-Then Get even branches.
I remember this.
Some young people were killed while they were
and sleep. The summer of 1960.
I did not know you were interested.
-I am not.
It says about it here.
But why l boys
so interested in murder?
The killer is still at large.
Is that not enough?
How regards it you?
Sheep l anything out of this?
What is it with you fanatics?
Should everything be about sex?
What about the truth?
Do you think really,
that l can solve the case?
l playing Sherlock or something.
-We Are doing a reconstruction.
-A What?
I want to try one of my theories.
It does not go without you and Nora.
It takes some that are just as
tall and heavy as you.
This must l two self-test.
-What are you doing?
-Strammer Cords.
What a waste.
What should we do?
What time is it?
Half eight, why?
Okay, that's enough.
-To what?
-Here.
-Where Are you from?
Make sure that the girls smoking enough.
You take it easy.
Yes.
Now there's a party!
It was damn time!
-lda, here.
-She Do not take it.
-Is Everything ready, Atte?
-very Soon.
Damn !
Come on. You promised,
that we should bathe together.
Such.
We'd better get started.
Such.
We'd better get started.
-If You ask nicely.
-I mean it. We begin.
-Will You bathe?
-We Do not have many hours.
I can swim with you.
-Can We get started?
-We Will not start with anything!
-Sov Now!
-The Water is ice cold.
lda, you can help,
so we can start?
It's fucking cold!
-I Mean business.
-Yes, Yes, Atte. Of course.
Add, where they here sucks.
They are 50 years old.
So, you realize that they stink.
What do you think happened here?
You dragged us out here,
because you have a theory.
Unlike what people think,
I think that the killer was an outsider.
One of the skills
it takes..
It is not easy
to surprise guys people.
And defeat them,
while fighting for their lives..
He followed perhaps by them
all day.
Listened to how they enjoyed themselves.
And decided to put
an end to it.
He knew exactly what he did.
He had patience
to wait for the right moment.
For the attack.
He knew the forest
as his own hand.
Like an outdoorsy,
hunter or so?
Yes I think so.
We must find out.
Maybe he's still here.
Exactly.
He may be living still,
if he was young then.
Thanks to smoke the night's sleep.
-Set Now he is watching us.
-Atte, Forget it.
-I mean it.
-If He saw our tent.
And us by the campfire.
-What Do you think he would think?
-It Will I page.
I go to bed.
Good night.
I also come.
-Nora, You do not.
-Mind your own business.
What did you really mean,
when you said
that for us fanatics
everything is about sex?
I do not know.
I talked nonsense.
I have no right to judge anyone.
No, but you're right. That's the way it is
at least starting to feel
At home, you know.
What happened to you was terrible.
The images.
I can not imagine,
how it feels.
But who would
shoot me on the sly?
But you have done well.
-Klaret Me?
I have not been able to
go anywhere since then.
You are here now.
Because you lied to us.
Do you think we dare go there?
I turn off the fire first.
I did not have the other.
I thought I saw a light.
Over there?
There is probably no.
-Shall we?
-I Be equal washed successively.
ldiot!
Sorry!
I just wanted to fetch water.
You do not like me.
You do not think,
I'm here because of you?
-Is everything alright?
-Yes.
lda.
So you Elijah?
No.
Nora!
What?
What is it?
Listen.
Elias!
What is it?
-There Is no outside.
No, there is not.
-Where are you going?
-I Look after.
-You must not go!
-Rolig, I will be back soon.

-Elias!
-He's Kidding.

In particular over you, Atte.

-Where are you going?
-I Have to pee. Thanks.
Sorry. I could not help myself.
You, should I go with?
-As A comfort.
-After What you just did?
Oh thank you.

Elijah can not understand the allusion.
Are there boys who makes it?
There is something I must say.
What?
I...
These are the pictures.
What is it?
I do not know for sure ...
I do not know for sure ...
-Atte?
-It's Not that simple.
Who took them?
Atte?
You need to say it.
What the hell?
l made it.
Elias?
Atte?
Atte, it's not fun.
They want to frighten us again.
They dragged a branch above.
Come, now we give back.
No.
-Come on!
-No.
I do not like that.
-So We play dead.
I hate that stuff.
Atte?
Hold op.
Hold op!
lda?
It's not funny.
Elias?
-Nora!
-lda!
Do not worry, it's just me.
It is me.
They play tricks with us.
I want to give back.
Help!
What the hell happened?
-I do not know. He had a knife.
-Who?
-Atte Was right. It was him!
What the hell?
-Who?
-We Need a stretcher.
-What are you talking about?
-It was him.
-Who?
-Help Me, dammit.
Come help!
What should we do?
I am so sorry.
Nora!
Do not give up.
Atte, we will not leave you.
He comes back, go!
Get out!
We should not have gone from Atte.
I should have been with him.
We can not drive.
Heard l it?
Av damn!
-What happened?
-Do not touch me.

We bear you.
Let's go.
It will not work.
We try a little more.

-Nora We carry you.
-No, Get help.

Wait! lda, wait.

Satan!
We have come back.
-I Was sure. We are lost!
-Be quiet.
-Fanden!
-Keep Your mouth shut, damn it!
I'll fix it.
We find the car.
-But Do not worry. Okay?
-Okay.
Atte's probably dead by now.
Do not say that.
Sorry.
We were not as good friends.
I thought that I was best friends.
It seemed he might.
I thought he was
damn annoying.
But you thrived with him.
-What do you mean?
-l was sitting by the fire all night.
-And?
lngenting.
You are doing well his thoughts.
Why did you do?
What?
I have my reasons.
Yes, it's hard to guess which.
We did not do anything.
-If You think that I and Nora ...
-Forget it..
lda!
lda, wait!
lda!
What is it?!
-I lied.
-About what?
About why I train with.
I would talk to you.
Without Nora or anyone else.
About what?
About the pictures of you.
-What Is it with pictures?
-Have you seen them?
Devil take you.
There is no nude pictures!
What?
I tried to find them.
And I of all should be able to do it.
Then it dawned on Atte.
There are no naked pictures of you.
When the rumor started, said everyone at the school,
that they had seen the pictures. Set you.
However, was not at all.
Anybody bothers you.
Someone will hurt you.
Everyone has seen the pictures.
lda.
-What now?
Why would I lie?
Because you're a guy.
Okay, but think about it:
you pass out at a party,
and anyone taking pictures of you.
Clothes you and share photos.
Yes.
So somebody should have seen the pictures.
Police. Your Family.
Someone should have seen them.
Nora saw them.
Exactly! And yet I am the one
to say sorry.
You do not have to.
Do you think that we believed in you?
The fact that we came out here for
to party in a cabin?
You should not boast too loudly.
I do not know what you're thinking
but I'm here for you.
It fits.
When we come out of here
I will do everything well again.
It is too late.
Do not say that.
You do not know.
Know what?
My heart...
It beats only for you.
How, darling.
Now it's done.
But we must hurry.
We are a little behind.
The watches.
Three, two, one.
Did you get it?
-lda, you got it?
-Sorry.
And overall late.
Next time
parterer we them.
-Klaret.
-lkke before we wake up at home.
Three hours and 26 minutes
for breakfast.
We lumber camp, taking into
to the city and driving the car in the water.
-So We are free.
-When We do it?
-Yes we do.
-Thanks.
You have thought of everything.
Now comes the tricky.
You run well.
Remember coupling.
-What now?
-Fandens!
What now?
The keys.
Elias has the car keys.
You're doing it.
Just proceed.
There is
Dive!
-Fik Them?
-I can not.
Do not say that!
You are the school's champion.
-I Come up.
-No. I will not let you come up.
-I Do not see anything down there.
-We have a problem.
If they find the car, they find us.
It's the only connection.
So they win.
2 hours and 20 minutes
for breakfast.
I beg you.
You're doing it.
I really mean it.
You're doing it.
lda!
Did you get them? You got them!
Now we run our way!
Nora...
We'll achieve it
There are a few hours
to sunrise.
It's not that.
Elias said something.
Of course.
Well, now he says never.
Reach?
What did he say?
-It Is surely nonsense.
-But The rodent?
Say it now.
He said
that there are no images.
Jaså.
'And you believed him?
-Of course not.
However, the rodent.
I've seen the pictures.
They were terrible.
I mean, why else would I
help my best friend?
Sorry.
There has been so much.
I am in. It is okay.
There has also been great for me.
But now you are free.
And I am too.
And I am too.
The images?
I have said millions of times.
However, such a precisely.
Have not we talked about this?
It is best that you do not know.
You could not handle it, believe me.
Forget it.
The guys got what they deserved.
And we can be as before.
Just the two of us, okay?
But ... We can not be seen anymore.
Do you mean it?
Think about it.
Nothing else attach to them.
Hell.
You are a brat.
Now we have even more reason to
to be friends.
But we are not only friends.
-Or, You're not.
-What did you say?
Sorry.
Make sure you mean it.
You are so damn ungrateful!
Who would kill them?
You or I?
You! Who but me
would have helped you?
Think about it!
Damn! You do not even know
how much I have done for you!
Your parents have so eternally right.
You are totally useless..
Pardon.
If you really love me,
tell it.
Were there any pictures,
or did you find it?
Do you think it was easy always
listening to your talk about Elijah?
I realized
I would lose you to him.
He was the only thing you were talking about.
I realized that I would lose you.
Then I came to it.
How I could
free yourself from Elias.
Get away from him.
I realized that I would lose you.
I would lose you.
Forever.
It was so easy.
It took just a few drinks.
And a bit ugly rumor.
Suddenly everyone was talking
about your nude photos.
Said they had seen them.
Said they had seen the pictures.
Said they had seen them.
The images, which did not exist.
I just had to
a scapegoat ...
And from the moment
were you again my.
were you again my.
So you said it.
The three most beautiful words.
They ought to die.
It took just
a suitable option.
It took just
an option.
Best of all, they believed,
that they fooled us
-I Believe in you.
-It's Always been your weakness.
When we get home,
I tell it all
I was afraid,
you'd say that.
Do not start crying.
You deserved it.
Let go of me!
I'll kill you!
Beware!
Do not touch me!
lda?
lda, wake up!
lda, are you okay?
lda, can you hear me?
lda, can you hear me?
lda, wake up.
Is everything alright?
Turn right headlight.
I was lucky.
lda, wake up.
Wake up.
So you know him?
-What are you doing?
-He Saw us. And the car.
Damn!
As before. You distracts him,
and I hit from behind.
No!
I do not want to anymore.
Give me your knife. My packed down.
-What Knife?
-What Did you use to kill Atte?
-What?
Was it not you who killed him?
No.
Damn.
Damn.
We jump out!
-Nora! Are you okay?
-Yes.
It can not be opened!
The rear seat!
Now!
lda, spring!
Do it!
Spring!
Nora!
He comes.
Wake up.
He comes.
Now we go.
Go to hell.
Can you move?
-No.
-Not at all?
Go.
No. I will not leave you.
-Go now.
-No.
You must survive.
Nora!
Run!
Nobody believed her.
Police investigated Bodom,
was looking for a fight with a dog.
But they found nothing.
Why would they do this?
All knew
that the giant did not exist.
There was only a crazy girl.
She could not even recognize
to herself what she had done.
And I think that that was it,
who destroyed her last.
Here it is.
