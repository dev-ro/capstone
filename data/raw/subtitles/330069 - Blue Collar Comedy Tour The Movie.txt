-Whose idea was this?
-I don't know.
This is fun. I don't even
want to go in the limo.
-You're gonna snag it up.
-No, but it floats.
I'm looking forward to that show.
Oh, man. It sold out.
-Good cast.
-That was a beautiful cast.
He can cast great.
He just can't catch anything.
He's a great caster.
Want to do a fishing show?
All you think about is fishing shows.
I hate those. Every cast,
they catch a fish.
We got $5000 worth of gear here,
and we can't get the bugs to bite.
First time I went fishing,
I was going with this girl.
We were going down to the lake.
She wanted to make love on a horse.
I'd never done it.
We did it. I'm trying to keep
my balance, and she fell off.
Then the manager of the Wal-Mart
come out and unplugged him.
I didn't want to make love on a horse.
I wanted to do it on a rocket ship they had.
Oh, man. Shut up.
Who do you think has been
with the ugliest woman here?
-Have you ever been with an ugly woman?
-The ugliest woman I've been with...
...I was with last week.
And I'm starting to miss her.
You remember that movie 9 1/2 Weeks?
When that fella had that woman
blindfolded and fed her fruit?
I had this idea to try that at my house.
Apparently, bologna and string cheese
is not a big turn-on for a woman.
Choose your condiment correctly.
One of those shows I was watching
said the big thing now...
...is to talk to your partner
while you're making love.
I heard that. Yeah.
Which, where I come from, means,
"Ain't no cars coming. Relax."
Hey, there's David.
-David!
-Does he see us out here?
We're in the middle of a lake, in a boat.
If he can't, I ain't riding with him.
-Come on, guys.
-Better get your stuff in.
Man, are you serious?
Come on! Got a show to do!
Have you ever had makeup on?
One time, but I was young
and needed the money.
-Hey, guys.
-David!
I didn't want to interrupt you.
Listen, I took the liberty...
...of doing a little shopping for you guys.
Now, as we discussed before...
...I just think you should give some color,
bring it to the stage, pizzazz.
David, this is the most dressed up
Larry has been all year long.
That's great. Listen, guys, pick a suit.
They're all labeled. Try them on.
Knock it out the box, and I'll be back
in a minute. Okay, fellas?
Do we put them on now?
No way!
Special sale? He bought stuff
that was on sale?
We're trying to get people's
favorite Jeff Foxworthy jokes.
You know you're a redneck if you go
to a family reunion looking for a wife.
-You might be a redneck--
-lf your tires cost more than your truck.
You might be a redneck--
If you find yourself climbing
a water tower--
To erase your sister's name.
If your wife has said, " Move this
transmission, so I can take a bath!"
I'm not just dead sure
I've got underwear on.
There ain't no way I'm squeezing
into these.
First of all, Tammy Faye Bakker...
...I want to say--
I'm kidding you! Come on!
You know you're a redneck if:
-Your mother can tell a state trooper to...
-Kiss her ass--
...kiss her ass without taking
the Marlboro out of her mouth.
You might be a redneck if you--
Got a motor swinging from a tree.
An engine swinging from a tree.
Look at this belt, fellas.
I didn't even know they made
a 28-button suit.
You know you're a redneck if:
You might be a redneck if--
You know you're a redneck--
-Mow your lawn--
-Mow your front yard--
If you mow your grass, and you find a car.
You might be a redneck if they
say at a dance " Do the hoedown"...
...and you throw your girlfriend
on the floor.
What's up, G?
A lot of white people in here this evening.
Where's my whores? Where's my whores?
You look like my relatives!
You can't go on-stage dressed like that!
Phoenix, Arizona, this is it!
Are you guys ready to laugh?
Make some noise, please,
for Mr. Ron White!
Yesterday I was sitting in
a beanbag chair naked, eating Cheetos.
I was flipping through the television,
and I saw Robert Tilton.
He's a televangelist from Dallas,
and he was staring at me.
He said this. He said:
"Are you lonely? "
Yeah.
He said, " Have you wasted half your life
in bars pursuing sins of the flesh? "
This guy's good!
He said, "Are you sitting in
a beanbag chair naked, eating Cheetos? "
Yes, sir!
He said, "Do you feel the urge
to get up and send me $1 000? "
Close! I thought he was talking
about me there for a second.
So anyway, I flew here from Flagstaff
because my manager doesn't own a globe.
I flew here on a plane that big...
...Iike a pack of gum
with eight people in it, just:
We took off from the Flagstaff Airport,
Hair Care and Tire Center there.
We're traveling at half the speed
of smell.
We got passed by a kite.
There was a goose behind us,
and the pilot was going, "Go around!"
We get halfway to Phoenix,
we gotta go back.
It's a nine-minute flight...
...can't pull it off with this equipment.
We had some engine trouble.
We lost some oil pressure in one engine.
They told us about it over
the speaker system of the plane...
...which was stupid
because they could have just went:
"Hey, we lost some oil pressure."
Heard you!
Everybody on the plane was nervous,
but I'd been drinking since lunch.
I was like, "Take it down. I don't care."
You ever have one of those days?
"Hit something hard. I don't wanna
limp away from this wreck."
The guy sitting next to me
is losing his mind.
Apparently, he had a lot to live for.
He goes, "Hey, man. Hey, man...
...if one of these engines fails,
how far will the other one take us? "
All the way to the scene of the crash...
...which is pretty handy
because that's where we're headed.
I bet we beat the paramedics there
by a half-hour.
I saw something today that came close
to truth in advertising.
The De Beers people are almost saying
what they really mean...
...because the old De Beers slogan was,
" Diamonds are forever."
Then they changed it to,
"This year, take her breath away."
The new slogan is,
"Diamonds, render her speechless."
Why don't they just go ahead and say it?
"Diamonds, that'll shut her up!"
For a minute.
It's good to be here.
I was here last summer.
They took me tubing down the Salt River,
and I was baffled by this.
I had never done it before.
Twenty-one of us met to go tube the river.
We had six ice chests full of beer
with the tubes wrapped around them.
We floated down that river drinking beer
for six and a half hours.
Not one person had to pee.
Is that normal?
I'd like to think my friends
wouldn't pee on themselves.
I know I would.
That was the best thing
about tubing.
You could just paddle up
to somebody you don't even know...
...talk to them
while you're peeing on yourself.
That's relaxed, right there.
If you're floating down a river,
drinking a beer, peeing on yourself...
...there's no tension there. Is there?
I guess we'd been floating down
that river for an hour before I realized...
...everybody's just peeing on themselves.
And I thought:
"Hell, I'll just pee on myself."
Everybody got mad at me.
Of course, I was in a canoe.
Standing up too.
Not everybody got mad. A couple people
viewed it as a photo opportunity.
And I know that because I got
their Christmas card last year.
I don't remember it being
that cold that afternoon.
So I just got back from 1 0 days
in Los Angeles.
If you ever have a chance to do that,
pass on that.
I learn things when I go to L.A.
I learned this:
They have bikinis now
made out of seashells.
I didn't know that.
I also didn't know this:
If you're on a beach and you see a girl
dressed in a bikini made of seashells...
...and you pick her up
and hold her to your ear...
...you can hear her scream.
I thought I'd hear the ocean,
but not over that woman.
We got in last night. Some guys asked
if I wanted to go to a topless bar...
...and I didn't want to go.
I ended up going because, you guys back
me up, you've seen one woman naked...
...you wanna see the rest of them naked.
It could be an old biker chick.
You know they'll hang down to here.
"You want to see me naked? "
Yeah, I do.
All right, that's enough.
Roll them back up.
Things that make you go:
It was a wild night.
I got back to the Phoenician Hotel.
They're so snooty.
I got back to the hotel
at 7:30 this morning...
...and I went up to the desk to leave
a wake-up call for 7:00.
And the lady goes,
"Mr. White, it's past 7."
"No, the next one.
You got another one coming around,
don't you?
Why don't you put me on that one?
Hear they're running two a day
through Arizona."
I'm from Texas. In Texas, we have
the death penalty, and we use it!
That's right. If you come to Texas
and kill somebody, we will kill you back.
That's our policy.
They're trying to pass a bill right now that
will speed up the process of execution...
...in heinous crimes where there's more
than three credible eyewitnesses.
If more than three people saw you, you
don't sit on death row for 1 5 years, Jack.
You go straight to the front of the line.
Other states are trying to abolish
the death penalty.
My state's putting in an express lane.
Thanks for playing along.
I hope you enjoyed it. Good night.
Fellas, look at this!
Let's go in!
-No, no, no!
-It's Victoria's Secret!
-Come back here.
-Come on!
-I wanna get my mom something.
-The last time you were in there--
Hi, welcome to Victoria's Secret.
Let's just get in, get him out of here.
I want to get my mom something
for her birthday.
-Something like this, perhaps?
-Look at these!
-See, they're stretchy, you know.
-These are small. You got anything larger?
Yes, I'm sure we have something.
These are cool. Look at these.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
-See how big it is?
-You can't do that.
This will cover the moles and the hair
coming out the top and the whole deal.
-She's got all sorts of problems.
-Ron.
It ain't for me.
These are cool. You got any
with other sayings on them?
Other sayings? Yes, we have
"just married" or "sexy" or "foxy."
-You can have them embroidered.
-I'd put "get her done" there.
-Yes.
-I could put some "get her done" drawers.
-We gotta go.
-Come on!
I got a good-looking girl here.
We're looking at leopard bikinis.
-I'm really sorry for him.
-I'll come back.
She showed me all kinds of furry britches.
-See you later!
-Bye!
Remember when you used to get
plastic dog turds...
-Black light bulbs.
-...the plastic vomits, and the...?
Nothing says, "Happy anniversary,
sweetheart" like rubber dog turds.
I love this store.
-This is the best store on the planet.
-lt is.
This is-- I'm telling you, Jeff,
this is art...
...Iike you have never heard.
It's remote-control fart?
You put it under somebody else's chair
and walk out of the room.
That's beautiful. How much is that?
Have a good day.
This man has made enough money
to buy anything in the mall...
...and he gets
the remote-control fart machine.
Very proud.
Oh, my God!
You know, if we'd grown up together...
...he would've been the guy we put
in the trunk and pushed down the stairs.
Sorry about that.
Oh, my God!
-Maybe I'll get some.
-lt lasts for 1 8 hours.
I apologize. I'll be back.
-Are you downwind or what?
-Yeah, I'll be back. I'm sorry.
This is a long-lasting product--
He's still trying to sell the product
the whole time I'm farting on him.
Phoenix, Arizona, I give you the one...
...the only, Larry the Cable Guy.
Get her done!
Boy, good to see you.
Good to see you.
I had a horrible nightmare last night.
I dreamt I drunk
the world's largest margarita...
...and woke up this morning,
there was salt on the toilet lid.
Thank God I didn't eat the worm
in there. I'll tell you that much.
Boy, that wouldn't have been good,
right there.
It was a crazy week.
I called one of them 900 talk-dirty numbers
the other day. You ever call one of them?
Yeah!
That's it? Two people? That's it?
And those voices sounded familiar,
to be honest with you.
Don't call. It's a rip-off.
I got a girl that stuttered,
and it cost me $1 700 on that deal.
Can you believe that?
But I love women.
I used to date this one girl
had one boob bigger than the other.
And she got in a wet T-shirt contest and
took first and third place at that contest.
Bless her heart. I was so proud
of my sister, bless her heart.
I used to date this one girl looked
like Michelle Pfeiffer, only shorter...
...and the face was different.
I was drinking,
it looked like Michelle Pfeiffer.
Next morning, Barney Pfeiffer's lying
in the bed next to me.
She was ugly.
I had one girl had a beauty mark
on her cheek.
That was sexy, like Cindy Crawford.
We get to kissing, and I was looking at it.
It was a tick!
I know. I disappeared like a set of rims
at a Puff Daddy concert.
I'll tell you what, I was out the door.
Out the door.
So I went shopping around today.
Went to the mall.
You ever seen this PETsMART?
The critter store? You been in there?
You know what they got in there?
A dog water-purifying machine.
You believe that? $75.
Dog water-purifying machine.
I'm like, "What's that thing do? " She says,
"lt purifies your dog's drinking water."
"He just ate a turd 1 0 minutes ago.
You got any turd-purifying machines
in here, for Pete's sake? "
What in the world? That's like wiping
before you poop. It don't make sense.
Doesn't make any sense at all.
Pete's sake.
Then I went in there--
I went in there to Victoria's Secret.
You ever been in there?
Get her done. That's right. That's like
a grown-feller Chuck E. Cheese in there.
I like that joint. I was there the other day.
I was sniffing around a couple hours...
...Iooking for some gift ideas.
You know what they got in there?
Underbritches with holes in the crotch.
You believe that?
Twenty-four dollars women paying
for undershorts with holes in the crotch.
I'm like, " Dadgum, I got a whole drawer
full of them at the house, for Pete's sake."
I bet I'm sitting on two, $300
worth of them underdrawers.
A girl put a pair of them on
for my birthday one time.
I come home, she's like,
"You want some of this? "
I'm like, "No, look what it did
to your undershorts."
Good Lord! What in the world?
Looked like a good place for one of them
Plug lns or something, for Pete's sake.
Vanilla Plug lns or something.
They got all kinds of stuff out there.
They got this deal now...
...britches you eat. You ever seen that?
Eating britches?
Who in the world thought
of eating britches?
"What do you want to do tonight? "
"Let me eat your undershorts.
Give me a glass of milk.
I'll gobble them up right here, I tell you.
Honey, put some in the refrigerator.
I'll make a sandwich later."
I was with a girl that liked that stuff.
I was seeing her for about six weeks.
And then somebody took
my binoculars out of the truck.
She was a midget stripper.
And-- Seriously.
I met her at a party one night,
and she popped out of a cupcake.
But anyway, she liked
all them edible underbritches.
And I bought her five pairs
of the strawberry eating-britches.
I bought five pair because I always eat
two or three pair on the way to her house.
They're pretty good.
Thank God they don't make them in
biscuits and gravy. I'll tell you that much.
Doggone right. I'd be getting fat
just on undershorts.
Need some SnackWell panties.
That's what they need, right there.
Get her done. That's right.
"Honey, I'm on a diet. Put on some
Fruit Roll-Ups, would you? "
That's right.
Went in for a checkup the other day.
Doctor stick his finger up my hind end.
Didn't even tell me, just does it.
I'm standing there. I'm like, "You gonna
watch the ball game? What in the world? "
Then he said he found something.
"Found something? I didn't even know
you was looking for nothing up there."
I'm all bent out of shape.
"What in the world's in my hind end?
Hope it's the remote control.
I ain't seen it in three weeks.
Dadgum, no wonder every time I fart
the volume goes up on that TV set."
Found something in my hind end!
That's the worst dentist I've been to
in about five years. I'll tell you straight up.
Tell you straight up.
A lot of people don't know it, but I used
to be a real psychic at fairs and stuff.
You know what I can do?
I was at the fair.
I used to be able to grab on
to girls' boobs, seriously...
...and tell how old they was
by doing that.
I used to be at the fair.
I had a little stool right there set up...
...had some key chains on it.
I'd tell them, "l can tell how old you are
by rubbing on your boobies."
So I'd be like, "Hold on."
I'm like, "You're 33 years old."
She's like, "You ain't even close."
I'm like, "Here's a key chain."
Get her done. That's right.
That's right.
I seen a girl walking around the other day
with earrings all over the place.
I was with a girl one time that
had nine earrings in this ear...
...seven earrings in that ear,
a ring in her nose, bolt in her tongue.
It was like making love to her
and working on my truck at the same time.
I didn't know if I should kiss her
or adjust the torque in her butt crack.
And my sister got one of them.
My sister's a big old girl.
I had to hire a rodeo clown to distract her
when I brung home the groceries last week.
But she got a belly ring. You believe that?
You don't get a belly ring if you're big.
You get onion rings.
I don't care who you are.
That's funny, right there. That's right.
I didn't know what it was. She walks in,
"What do you think of that? "
I'm like, "Hey, you got a hitch.
Yeah, now we can pull you away
from the buffet every night.
It's about time you done something,
for Pete's sake."
That's right.
I was watching the TV the other day.
People suing everybody nowadays.
You believe that? People getting sued
for smoking the cigarettes.
They say it cause cancer. They gonna get
sick. It says on the box you gonna get sick!
I'm gonna sue Hustler Magazine for giving
my wrist carpal tunnel. How's that sound?
That's right.
That's funny. I don't care who you are.
That's funny, right there.
You can't laugh at that, you need to
get out of here, 'cause that's funny.
That's funny. They want to take
the Winston out of NASCAR.
Did you know that?
They say that's offensive.
What in the world? Who's gonna sponsor
NASCAR? Stayfree mini-pad?
That'd be pretty good racing,
wouldn't it?
"We got 43 cars this year
in the Kotex Cup.
There's Jeff Gordon in the number 24
strawberry douche Chevy Monte Carlo."
"How did you get tickets
to the Tampon 200? "
"Well, we pulled some strings,
and we got some good seats in there."
Get her done!
Y'all, thank you very much!
Thank you all for a great show!
Thank you!
-ls this where it is?
-"Mist Spay."
-"Spa."
-Whatever.
I hope they can get rid of backache.
-Now, behave.
-Hello.
Hi there, we're with
the Blue Collar Comedy Tour.
Yes, we've been expecting you. Thanks
for coming. Have you been to a spa before?
-No.
-No.
Is this a non-smoking spa?
Yes. Well, why don't we do a tour?
Now, behave.
So this is kind of like
a really expensive wet T-shirt contest.
You got a dollar?
-How does it feel? What does it do for you?
-Put a dollar in the towel.
Go ahead and show.
Come on, baby, I got three dollars.
Shoot, I'll give you a $1 0 bill right there.
Look at that.
Get four, 35 and a half.
What do you bid now? Five.
What do you bid now? Five and a half.
What do you bid now? Five.
All right. By God,
you done made almost $60.
You got any more rooms with women
dipped in chocolate sauce like that one?
Do you have an opening
as a towel boy here?
What's she doing?
I believe you're doing it wrong. Hold on,
you go like this. You kind of hit on them.
That's nice. Do you like that? See.
-I love that.
-Now, that's how you give a massage.
Make sure you hit her hind end a couple
of times, like Wipeout or something.
Okay.
Okay, this feels really funky.
Hey, what kind of joint
you running in here?
There's nothing like a single-malt Scotch
at 1 0 in the morning with a little mud rub.
That's what keeps me going.
Hey-- Oh, God!
Hey, Ron!
Hey, Ron, I bet you look like
the monster from the Black Lagoon!
Shut up! I'm doing pretty good in here.
So I say we get naked and throw ice
at each other. What do you think?
-Hey, Larry?
-Over here!
Just remember, when you gotta go
to the bathroom, get out of the tub!
Too late!
-I'm starting to feel a lot better.
-Oh, my God.
I feel like a new man.
Ladies and gentleman, please welcome
a native of Winslow, Arizona...
...a very funny man, Mr. Bill Engvall!
What' s up?
It is great to be here tonight.
In fact, it' s just great to be
out of the house.
I'll tell you why. My wife and I had an
argument last week that was so stupid...
...that it bears repeating.
My wife collects twist-ties.
Welcome to my world.
What happened was,
I went to make a sandwich.
I took the bread, took the twist-tie off,
threw it down, made my sandwich.
Did I put the twist-tie back on the bread?
No. I did what every man
in America does.
I spun the loaf of bread
and tucked it underneath.
But apparently,
that's where I went wrong.
I got a great family.
I got a 1 6-year-old daughter
who just got her driver's license.
So drop to your knees and thank
the good Lord above that you live here...
...and not where we live.
She is without a doubt
the worst driver on the planet.
She's got no depth perception at all.
We came up to this intersection.
There's a car stopped.
I'm like, "He stopped. He stopped!
He stopped!"
She goes, "l can see that."
I'm like, "Oh, my God, she's her mother!"
The other day, my neighbor asked, "When
did you put the CD boom box in your car? "
I said, "What? "
He goes, "l saw you and your daughter
driving down the street, and I heard this--"
I said, "That was me stomping on the
imaginary brake on my side of the car."
I'm convinced there needs to be
a teenage driving lane on the highway.
And it's just lined
with mattresses and tires.
God, she's growing up,
and I don't know when it happened, man.
I used to buy her Minnie Mouse panties
and little Winnie the Pooh underwear.
I was helping my wife fold clothes.
I picked up a pair of skimpy underwear.
I looked at my wife and said:
"When you gonna wear these for me? "
She goes, "l can't.
They're your daughter's."
No, no, no!
There was nothing to them!
When the how-to-wash tag
is the biggest piece of cloth on there....
She's just growing up, and she's smarter
than me. And she's starting to realize that.
She came home and goes,
"Can you help me with my math? "
And I said, "Yeah, baby,
let me take a look at it."
"When did they start putting
letters with it? "
She's got a lot of friends. She's friends
with the popular kids, the unpopular kids...
...and she's in the middle,
which is where you want them...
...until they bring home one of their friends
you don't see eye to eye with.
She's got a little friend who's
into this goth stuff. Oh, my God.
Have you seen these little freaks?
What happened?
The black nail polish, black lipstick, black
eyeliner, black hair, Liquid-Paper-white face.
I'm sorry. Didn't we used
to call that Halloween?
They walked in the front door, and l
looked at that little girl and just went:
I'm trying to be nice, and my daughter
said, "Daddy, this is my friend Lucy."
And I said, "Hey, Luci...fer."
She looked at me like,
"l will set you ablaze right now."
Nobody tells you about that
when you have kids.
Nobody tells you about the stuff
you never hear about.
Nobody told me kids would get out
of their bed and come into your room.
My son developed this really bad habit.
He would come to my side of the bed...
...and he'd get that close to my face.
And just stare at me.
You ever get that feeling when you know
you're being watched? He'd be like:
"Dad.
Dad.
-Dad."
-"What? What? What? "
He starts crying.
My wife goes, "You scared him!"
I'm like, "Hell, he scared me!
Jesus, put a bell around his neck!"
And if I ever find out who told
my son this, I will kill him.
Apparently, somebody told my son
there's a wiener thief out there.
And if he takes his hand off it,
they gonna snatch it away.
His hand doesn't leave his pants.
It's like his own little worry stone.
He's just:
I told him. I said, "Boy, that thing's
got a shelf life. Trust me."
Then we had to have the big talk this year.
I was on the road. My wife called and said,
"You need to have a talk with your son."
Guess he's in trouble.
She goes, "His friends taught him to go on
the lnternet, and he brought up a sex site."
And I said, "Oh, God."
I said, "Baby...
...did you write down
the name of the site?
Just for reference."
She goes, "Shut up."
I wanted my talk to be more informative
with my son than my dad and l's was.
I said, "Dad, when will you
tell me about sex? " He goes:
"Here, just read this Penthouse Forum."
So I wanted my talk
to be a little more informative.
I wanted my son to know about things
that could actually happen to him.
I'm still waiting on the VW bus full of
cheerleaders, but that hasn't happened yet.
But I know kids today are much more
advanced than you and I were.
So I said, "Son, I know
you already know a lot of things.
So why don't you
tell me what you know...
...and I'll just fill in the blank spots."
About 30 minutes later...
...I'm sitting there with a pen
and a pad of paper.
I'm going, "You can do that? "
God bless my family. They've been good
to me this year. It's been rough.
I've been trying to quit smoking. It'll kill
me quicker than the cigarettes would've.
Anybody who's ever tried to quit
knows exactly what I'm talking about.
It is the hardest thing
you will ever do in your life.
And people who have never smoked
just don't get that.
My wife goes, "l don't understand why
you just don't put them down and quit."
I go, "Baby, I am trying. It is hard."
She goes, "l don't understand why
you just don't quit."
I go, "All right.
Why don't you quit yelling?
Because you can't."
And I've tried everything.
I've tried the gum. I couldn't keep it lit.
I tried the patches.
They pulled the skin off my lips.
Finally, my wife goes,
"Why don't you try acupuncture? " And I go:
"lsn't that where they screw needles
into you? " She goes, "Yeah."
And I go, "Why don't you try waking up?
I won't let somebody screw needles
into me." She goes, "It's your last option."
So we found this lady named Dr. Chang.
I had one question for Dr. Chang.
Anybody know what that question
might have been? "Does it hurt? "
She goes, "Oh, no. It no hurt."
From a door three feet away from me,
I hear a grown man go:
I go, "What was that? "
And she goes, "He big baby."
I said, "I'm a big baby."
Next thing I know,
I'm lying on this bed in my underwear.
She has screwed a needle into the top
of my head, three in each earlobe...
...one in each pec, one in each shin
and three between each of my toes.
I'm lying on that bed thinking, "Dear God,
I could use a cigarette right now."
I can hear her and her partner talking
in Chinese. I don't speak Chinese.
And then they start laughing.
I'm like, "Oh, my God!
They're filming this."
She comes in at the half-hour mark.
I think she'll take the needles out.
No. She puts a cotton ball
on each of the ones in my legs...
...Iights it on fire and leaves the room!
Now I'm freaking out
because all I can see...
...is smoke drifting up from between
my legs, and I cannot inhale it. Okey-dokey?
Finally, at the hour mark, she comes in,
she takes the needles out and she goes:
"You come back for another treatment."
I said, "Well, let's just book that right now.
After that, I'll schedule a prostate exam.
Just be a big day for me."
I put my ball cap on.
I'm gonna go home and take a shower.
I've sweated through this whole ordeal.
I'm standing in the bathroom in front
of the mirror. I took my cap off and I went:
She left the needle in my head!
I took my family
on an RV trip last summer.
I thought RV stood for
"recreational vehicle." No.
It stands for "ruins vacations."
I had never driven one of these things.
Dear God, It's 35 feet long, 8 feet wide...
...and got two mirrors that stick out
three feet on each side.
Good Lord, I was like a passenger
trying to land a 747.
I'm weaving all over the road.
I'm getting flipped off by kids
in car seats, all right?
Don't know why they put a reverse on these
dumb things. I never learned to back it up.
If I pulled into a Quickie Mart
too far past the pump to get gas...
...there was no backing up.
It was, go all the way around the block
and try it again.
Thank God I wasn't the only one.
Sometimes there would be seven or eight
of us just circling that Quickie Mart...
...just like a white trash road race.
I took my family camping
because I'm an idiot.
We're gonna go camping. We live in L.A.
We don't have any camping gear.
So I go to this store,
and I'm buying camping gear...
...and I saw this product.
And when I saw it, I just started laughing.
Because we've become
so ecologically-minded now...
...they've developed a product called
"Rapidly Dissolving Toilet Paper."
Just how rapidly are we talking?
Because I don't want to have to play
Beat the Clock in the thicket, all right?
If it's dark,
I can't see what's going on.
I got to know that toilet paper
is gonna be there to finish the job.
But the reason you
go on these RV trips...
...and these camping trips
is because as your kids grow up...
...they also grow apart from you,
and it tears your heart out.
My little girl is 1 6. She's at that age where
she's in her room listening to her stereo...
...online with her friends,
and boys are starting to call.
Oh, my God. We had a kid call the house
at 2 in the morning.
I lost it.
First off, I'm sound asleep
in la-la land...
...with Shania Twain
in the mountains somewhere.
I hear a phone ring and I'm like,
"Who's got a phone in the mountains?!"
So when I realized it's my phone,
I'm already ticked off. I went, "Hello!"
And this little voice goes,
"ls Emily there? "
And I go, "Dude...
...if you have a brain in your skull,
you will hang this phone up right now."
And my wife goes,
"Bill, you gotta be nice."
I said, "No, ma'am,
nice stops at midnight."
She said, "What will you do
when these little boys come over? "
"I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm gonna
pull the young man in tight next to me...
...so only he and I can hear
the conversation.
I'm gonna whisper in his ear.
I'm gonna say, 'Boy, look at me.
You see that little girl there?
That's my only little girl. She's my life.
So if you have any thoughts
about hugging...
...or kissing,
you remember these words:
I got no problem going back to prison.'"
God bless my wife. That's what
she puts up with every day of the year.
On our 20th anniversary,
I got to thinking about the difference...
...between that first year of marriage
and that 20th year. Wow.
Remember that first year? You'd pick a fight
just so you could make up and have sex.
Twenty years later, you pick a fight
just so they'll sleep in the other room.
That first year, you'd come home
from a bad day at work. You go:
" I've had a bad day."
Your new bride would go:
"Let me get you a beer
and you tell me all about it."
Twenty years later, you walk in the door,
"What a day at work!"
They go, "You want to hear
what went on at this house today?!
While you were at your job? "
That first year of marriage,
if you had to go to the bathroom...
...you shut the door, lock it,
turn the faucets on, turn the shower on.
God forbid they knew you
were going poop.
Twenty years later,
bathroom door is wide open...
...and you're screaming,
"Bring the camera!"
That first year, your new bride was gonna
do laundry and you freaked out...
...because you might have had
dirty underwear. So you threw them away.
Twenty years later,
you're just hoping to gross them out.
If you can get your wife to scream,
"Oh, my God!
Did you hit a deer? "
Sex changes when you stay married
for a long time.
I think it has to because
things advance, you know?
One night, my wife and I had
a little interlude, and it was hot.
I mean hot, hot, hot!
She's arching her back and moaning,
and I said, "Yes, ma'am.
You are welcome."
I said, "I'm really turning you on, huh? "
She goes, "No, you're on my hair! Get off!"
You never see that in the movies.
Do you, ladies?
I hate love scenes in movies. They're
not real. Show me a real love scene.
Show me a couple in bed, and their dogs
are watching them at the edge of the bed.
That's real, my friends.
You're trying to throw down
your best moves...
...and there's these eyes
at the edge of the bed, just like:
"Nice move there, Bill.
Jeez, don't that hurt your back? "
I take my wife's bra off
and throw it across the room.
Dogs bring it back.
I can always tell when I'm doing good
because the dog growls.
"She's loving this."
You ever get that cold nose?
But you gotta be able to laugh.
That's what's important.
Three years ago on my wife's birthday,
I had it planned to the tee:
A bottle of champagne
chilled by the bed...
...candles on the headboard, some soft
music playing, and we just got into it.
Just that hot pig sex, all right?
You're not even talking.
You're just rooting around, baby.
But we forgot about the candles
on the headboard.
I'm lying on my back. Apparently,
that headboard was doing a little moving.
Because all of a sudden,
hot wax just goes:
And my wife goes, "Yes, sir.
You are welcome."
God bless y'all. This has been great.
-Where's Fox?
-He went running around. He's like a kid.
-My granddaddy had this exact truck.
-Did he really?
Yep. 1 934 Chevrolet 31 00.
Can you see me now?
-Can you see me now?
-You guys see Jeff?
Yeah, we can see you.
-Where you going?
-Looks good, though.
Boy, they're making some money in here.
-Can you see me now?
-Yes, Jeff. We can see you.
Look at this bass.
-Look at that catfish.
-It's huge.
Jeff, we can still see you.
-Where?
-He's right there. Let's go.
-Good God!
-Let's go. Jeff, go take it off.
Dude, that's pretty good.
-That's pretty good right there.
-Get out of here.
-Coleman camp stove.
-That's beautiful.
Jeff, we see you.
-Can you believe that?
-That's a fake tree.
-That's Jeff again, trying to scare us.
-It's a fake tree.
-How did you do that?
-See what you started?
-I like any bait called "Spanky."
-Where might we find the stink bait?
-Does anybody work in this store?
-There's got to be a stink specialist around.
-We need stink bait.
-Do y'all have stink bait?
How would you rank the stink?
We want stanky stink.
-Stanky, sure enough stanking stink.
-Probably this one right here.
That's a good stank right there.
Y'all need to smell that.
Oh, God.
-Five bucks says you won't eat any.
-I ain't eating stink bait.
Just taste it.
-Oh, man! God. No!
-He did it.
-He did it.
-He did it.
Oh, my God.
-I cannot believe you ate it.
-Does he need the money?
Ladies and gentlemen,
the man you've all been waiting for:
Mr. Jeff Foxworthy!
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. How are you?
Phoenix in July.
Apparently, the people that book
these things don't get the Weather Channel.
It's been one of those years for me.
In February, I was doing a show
in the northern part of Minnesota.
It was so cold-- Beautiful place.
It was so cold. It was like 1 5 below zero.
After the show, we were talking
to some guys backstage...
...and they were trying to talk us
into going ice fishing with them.
It's 1 5 degrees below zero.
I said, "Guys, I appreciate it.
I don't really think I want to be that cold."
One of the guys goes, "It's not that cold.
We build a bonfire out on the lake."
And you call us stupid in the South?
But I got to thinking about ice fishing...
...especially from the point of view of
the fish that gets caught and thrown back.
In the animal kingdom...
...that has got to be the closest thing
to one of those out-of-body experiences.
That fish that gets thrown back
goes back and tells his buddies:
"Dudes, I was swimming along...
...and all of a sudden,
I felt myself being drawn towards the light.
It was getting brighter and brighter.
And then I went through this opening...
...and I saw my dead relatives
all around me.
And I saw God. He was wearing
a flannel shirt and a Budweiser hat.
He held me and said,
'It's not yet your time. Go back.'"
One cool thing about doing this tour
is we've been everywhere in the country.
Traveling is never a lot of fun,
but since 9/1 1 it's so much more difficult.
I live in Atlanta. In the Atlanta airport,
where you go through the metal detectors...
...they have now built
a giant Plexiglas box...
...that contains all the things...
...that are no longer allowed
in your carryon luggage.
And in that box, there is a leaf blower...
...and a Coleman lantern.
So if you are an international yardman
that likes to work nights...
...you are S.O.L. right now.
A leaf blower. Who is hijacking a plane
with a leaf blower?
"Turn the plane around. I mess your hair up
so bad, your mother never recognize you."
If your job requires
you use a leaf blower...
...and you have to get on an airplane
to get to that job...
...it is really time to review your territory.
They tell us now the economy is bad.
You see it in the airports.
Because everywhere we go now,
all the rental car places...
...are selling the used rental cars.
I've driven some bad vehicles in my life.
I have never been so desperate for
an automobile I wanted a used rental car.
You know what people do to rental cars.
My mother will not drive 55 miles an hour.
You put her in a rental car, she's doing
doughnuts in the grocery store parking lot.
Buying a used rental car...
...is kind of like going to a house
of ill repute looking for a wife.
Anything that's been driven that hard
by that many people...
...you really don't want
to put your key in it.
There's no incentive
to take care of a rental car...
...because if you pay
the extra insurance...
...you can total that rental car,
and they'll bring you another one.
Always get the additional insurance.
They're like:
"Would you like the additional coverage? "
I'm like, "Yes, I would.
You got a Ford Fiesta
that's about to see more air time...
...than a skateboard at the X Games."
So welcome to our job. We feel
like we have the coolest job in the world.
It's funny, because you get
to meet a lot of people backstage.
When you're a comedian,
the number one thing people say to you:
"Where do you come up with material? "
The honest answer, at least for us, is...
...the best stuff is not stuff you make up.
It's true stuff.
That being said,
I have to share this story with you.
Last year, I was hosting a show
for the children's hospital in Atlanta.
A couple came up to me.
The man said to me,
" I bet you done heard every redneck thing."
I was thinking, "I've heard a lot of them."
But I love talking to folks.
I said, "No. Go ahead."
He said, "Well...
...my wife and I decided if we ever had
the chance to meet you...
...we had to tell you about the time
we were down at her family's house.
While we were there, her brother
got his nipple bitten off by a beaver."
I said, "You have my attention."
It's kind of hard to walk away
from a story like that.
You're almost required to say,
"How did that happen? "
They were happy to share the whole tale.
The brother and his buddy
were driving down the road...
...and a beaver ran across the street.
They accidentally hit it.
Then the beaver went down
into the ditch on the side of the road.
So they decided they were going down
in the ditch to find this thing...
...because they wanted
to take it to the taxidermist.
We know how pretty they look
on a Thanksgiving dining room table...
...just holding that turkey up.
So he said he went down in the ditch.
He found the beaver.
He picked it up by the tail.
And he said, "Look at it.
It ain't cut up or bloody or nothing."
Apparently, "nothing" is the word that
brings a beaver back to consciousness.
At that point, the animal lurched out
and bit his nipple off.
Did not bite it, bit it off.
O-F-F, off. Bit it off.
That is a new kind of hurt right there.
And it is so rare,
I am at a loss for words.
The only reply I could come up with, I said,
"l bet that is the only time in history...
...the headline of the paper could include
the words "beaver" and "nipple"...
...and nobody'd be offended by it.
The other question I get asked:
"When you say somebody might be
a redneck, what do you mean? "
For the record, my definition of "redneck" :
a glorious absence of sophistication.
That's all it is.
It can be full-time or part-time.
Most of us are guilty of it.
And if you're not guilty of it,
you do have relatives that are.
Think back to the last family reunion,
when at the end of it...
...you got in the car and looked
at your spouse and said, "Oh, my God.
What is wrong with them?
The little one is not right.
I guarantee you, the little one is not right."
I got rednecks in my family.
I got an uncle who climbs in and out
of the car through the driver's side window.
The door's not broke or anything. He just
likes to pretend he's a NASCAR driver.
Got a few NASCAR fans
in Phoenix, huh?
I love NASCAR.
It's a difficult thing to talk about on-stage...
...because NASCAR fans
will start fighting with each other.
Every NASCAR fan has got
that one driver they love...
...and every NASCAR fan has got
that one driver they can't stand.
Jeff Gordon.
It's always Jeff Gordon.
I've figured out why a lot of NASCAR fans
don't like Jeff Gordon.
It's not because Gordon won the points
championship and wins a lot of races.
A lot of NASCAR fans don't like
Jeff Gordon because he enunciates.
There's not a place in NASCAR
for that kind of stuff.
See, true NASCAR fans
want an interview with a driver...
...where you have no idea
what he's talking about.
"Boy, I tell you, we run pretty good
all day long and developed a bit of a push...
...and brought her in, booger-jacked some
wedge in her and she run like a spotted....
Did get trouble in the middle of the race
when Ricky puked a motor...
...and I touched Dale on the backside.
But for the most part, the Hardee's-Burger
King-Taco Bell-KFC Chevrolet is awesome.
As Southern as I am,
I'm like, " Dude, what?
Were there any words in that? "
Speaking of words, I do have
a few new redneck words for you.
First one: "mayonnaise."
Mayonnaise a lot of people
here this evening.
It's kind of a gift. They come to me
in my sleep. I write them down.
Brand-new one: "aorta."
Aorta cut that grass down by
the ball field so them kids don't get hurt.
Is this not the stupidest thing
you've ever heard in your life?
"lnitiate."
My wife ate two hamburgers...
...initiate a bag
of potato chips.
And last but not least: "with you, did you."
With you, did you.
You didn't bring your truck with you,
did you?
Somebody will be using
"with you, did you" tomorrow.
I always felt like you couldn't talk
about rednecks unless you are one...
...and I are one.
Growing up,
I didn't know that's what I was.
Now, looking back, it was so obvious.
I'm not making this up.
My entire childhood, our mailbox...
...had the letters m-a-l-e
painted on the side of it.
By the time I was in the 1 1 th grade,
I was like, "That ain't right.
That M is supposed
to be capitalized, isn't it? "
That is a true story. When I was in
the 3rd grade, my uncle did that as a joke.
And nobody got it.
Not only am I a redneck,
I married into a special breed of them.
My wife and her entire family
are from the great state of Louisiana.
We were down there
about six or seven months ago.
My wife's cousin got married
in Baton Rouge. We went for the wedding.
We had my wife's
entire family together...
...for the rehearsal dinner at Hooters.
If I'm lying, I'm dying.
And our waitress that night
was qualified to work there.
Matter of fact, I'm pretty sure
she was on a scholarship.
The first time she walked up
to the table...
...my wife's uncle, Bud, looked
at her and went:
"Where did you get them things, girl? "
I thought she was gonna get mad. She didn't.
She was cool. She said, "l bought them."
Then Bud's wife, Lois, said,
"I've been thinking about buying me some."
Bud turned to Lois and said,
"You are 62 years old.
You getting a boob job
would be like hanging...
...a new chandelier in a haunted house."
She said,
"lf I put new lights in the house...
...you might stay in it
longer than two minutes."
My children share these genes.
I will say this in defense of my in-laws:
My in-laws are nuts...
...but I know why they're nuts.
A long time ago, they looked at each other
and said, "Why don't we have children? "
I know I'm on my way to being crazy
like my in-laws because I'm a parent.
I'm the proud father of two little girls.
They're 8 and 1 0.
Thank you.
I live next door to my brother.
He has three children, all girls.
Their ages are 6, 8 and 1 0.
My mother has nine grandchildren.
They are all girls.
The oldest one is 1 3 years old.
I live in the estrogen ocean...
...in the middle
of the naked Barbie Woodstock.
Naked Barbies as far as the eye can see.
There are days I have fantasies
about being G.I. Joe on a three-day pass.
"Hello, lady."
But I love these girls.
I have learned so much about girls.
I've learned girls can be
a little bit more emotional than boys.
I spend half my life trying to figure out
what people are crying about.
" Honey, calm down,
and just tell me what happened."
" I came in, and I was gonna go
and play with them...
...but then they locked the door
and called me a stupid-head.
They said I couldn't be in their club.
I was looking for you,
and I was calling you and calling you--"
I'm like, "Honey, calm down. You'll scare
the children. Tell me what happened."
Men have no idea what to do with crying.
Men have been taught not to cry.
We can be out cutting firewood
with our buddies...
...we'll chainsaw our leg off at the knee.
We're like, "I'm all right. I'm all right.
Throw the leg in the cooler.
Hand me a beer. I'm all right."
Kids are great for a comedian
because kids are funny...
...without even trying to be funny.
My wife and my mother-in-law had ordered
bathing suits through the mail. Mail order.
So the bathing suits arrived.
They're trying them on.
My mother-in-law walks out
in her bathing suit.
My daughter looked at her and said:
"Gamma, you shouldn't draw on your legs
with a blue Magic Marker."
Needless to say, I had to mop up
the milk I had been drinking...
...because it was on the other side
of the room...
...which is pretty good distance
through your nose. That's right.
That's gonna sting a little while.
I was doing a thing not long ago
for HBO...
...and they were asking
serious questions.
One of them was,
"What's your earliest recollection in life? "
I said, "l remember being 3, standing on
the front seat of the car with my dad.
Every time he would turn the corner,
I would make the sound of tires squealing.
My dad would go,
'Quit squealing my tires.'"
All of a sudden, it dawned on me. What was
I doing standing on the front seat of the car?
Back then, kids weren't too good to go
through the windshield with the rest of us.
When my kids were 3,
I couldn't back out of the driveway...
...unless they were in a car seat
with a shoulder strap and a safety fit.
Think back. I can vividly recall
riding all the way to Florida...
...Iaying in the back window of the car.
People behind us going, "Harold,
is that one of those bobbing dogs? "
"No. That's a skinny kid with a big head.
Boy, what a big head."
My dad slammed on the brakes, you went
bouncing around the car like a pinball game.
I remember as a child, my mom would leave
me, my brother and my sister in the car...
...while she ran into the grocery store.
If you did that to a poodle now,
they would fry you on the 6:00 news.
Now that I'm grown
and have kids of my own...
...I understand why my mother didn't want
to take three young'uns in the store.
I would rather take a beating with a brick
stick than take kids in the grocery store.
Soon as those doors slide open...
...those kids start begging
like homeless people at Christmastime.
The worst aisle to take kids
down in the grocery store is...
...the cereal aisle.
I hate the cereal aisle.
You know why? Because kids buy cereal
the same way grown men buy lingerie.
They will buy stuff they care nothing about
just to get the prize that's inside.
You forget about the cereal aisle.
You're in the store trying to keep them
from putting stuff in the cart.
You turn the corner, and there it is.
And they're like:
"You gotta buy
the Fruity Frosted Pebbles.
Please. Please. Please buy
the Fruity Frosted Pebbles. Please."
"We bought it before. You didn't even eat it.
It went stale. We had to throw it away."
"We'll eat it today.
We'll eat it in the car on the way home.
I promise. I swear. I promise."
"l said I'm not buying it. Put it back."
"You gotta buy it! You gotta buy it!
You gotta buy it!"
And that is the point...
...when I very calmly walk up
to the child, and I say:
"Where are your parents? "
Everything has changed.
Even their toys have changed.
I noticed every toy my kids get has tags in it
showing you somebody has inspected it...
...to make sure there's no way a child
could hurt themselves playing with that toy.
I remember being 9 years old.
My parents bought me a wood burning kit.
What could possibly go wrong
with a toy like that?
A sharp, metal stick that heated up
to 5000 degrees.
Our dogs and cats didn't have tags
around their neck...
...but everybody in the neighborhood
knew who they belonged to.
"The Circle F brand.
That's a Foxworthy cat right there."
You remember the wood burning kits?
Remember those?
The cord on it was about that long.
So you're always guaranteed to be right
next to the drapes while you played with it.
What were they thinking?
Did anybody else have the swing set?
My parents were too lazy
to actually pour the concrete in the ground.
With our swing set, every time you swung
above this high, the front legs would go:
There were stuntmen
that would not swing on our swing set.
What were they thinking,
some of those toys?
Lawn Darts.
Twelve-pound darts!
You could kill an elk
with a Lawn Dart!
There were no directions.
They came in a box of eight.
We pulled them out of the box,
threw them straight up in the air.
Catch one with your head...
...you're getting coloring books
for Christmas for the rest of your life.
A lot of guys say to me, "Man,
how you live with all those women? "
I love living with all those women.
I've accepted the fact they just about
have me trained the way they want me.
A lot of men go through their lives
never realizing they're being trained.
If you got a wife, girlfriend, mother
or daughter, you are being trained.
And just because they ain't using
the cattle prod don't mean it ain't happening.
I been married 1 8 years
to an awesome girl.
It did not dawn on me until
about year five she was training me.
I remember the night I realized it.
We were both in bed reading one night.
And my wife said:
"I'm hot."
And I closed my book...
...got out of bed...
...walked over to the wall,
I turned on the ceiling fan...
...I was almost back to the bed
and I went, "Whoa!
I wasn't hot."
I guarantee the next morning
she called her mother and said:
"Mama, it is working so well.
Last night, I said, 'I'm hot.' And he got
out of bed and turned on the ceiling fan."
And I'm sure her mother said,
"Baby, I am so proud of you.
I'd put your daddy on the phone
and let you tell him...
...but I just said, 'I'm hungry.' And
he ran into town to get me something."
Guys, do you know why
they are able to train us?
They are smarter than us.
It ain't that big a deal.
That's saying you're smarter than
a creature that takes off its underwear...
...tries to grab them with its toes,
flip them in the air...
...and catch them with its hand.
You are smarter than that.
It is a good feeling when you catch them
on the first try, though.
Got my underpants, right there!
Women are smart,
and women keep men confused.
A lot of times, men and women can say
the exact same thing to each other...
...and get totally opposite responses.
A woman can say to a man:
" I'm not wearing any underwear."
The man's first thought is,
"All right!
Might get lucky."
But if a man says, "I'm not wearing
any underwear," her first thought is:
"Oh, no! I'm gonna have
to wash those pants twice."
And I've found from living
with all these women...
...men and women worry
about totally different stuff.
I wish I had a dime for every time
in 1 8 years of marriage...
...my wife has said, usually when
we're walking out of the house:
"How's my butt look? "
If you've been married longer than
1 0 seconds, you know the answer.
"Great!
It's so small I could barely see it
in this light."
Apparently, women put a lot of thought
into what their butts look like.
Ladies, do you know men are not
even aware of the fact...
...we have a butt till it starts itching?
A lot of guys aren't aware that
scratching it in public might be offensive.
Mr. President, how you doing?
Good to see you.
And men ought to keep our hands
off our rear ends. We should.
For a lot of reasons.
The biggest...
...is because we are causing
our own butt-erosion.
We are. Have you ever seen
an old man's butt?
No, because they don't have one anymore.
They've scratched it all off.
An old man's butt looks like
you made a frog stand up...
...and put on a pair
of double-knit pants.
When you go to sleep tonight,
I want that to be the last visual image.
That frog pulling them britches up.
I have lots of theories about women,
and I'm sure none of them are right.
But I found out women have
just as many theories about men.
Probably the most common theory
women have about men...
...I bet I've heard this one in every state,
goes something like this:
" If he's got big feet...
...then you know."
Or if he's got big hands.
Or if he's got a big nose.
If he's got big ears.
Well, he better be packing,
'cause that's one goofy-looking guy.
And, silly as it is, men do
worry about these things.
Ladies, bless your heart.
You have come up with all
these expressions to reassure us.
"Honey, it's not the size of the ship,
it's the motion of the ocean."
Which might be true,
but it takes a long time...
...to get to England in a rowboat.
Couple of ladies writing that down,
"Takes a long time...."
Time is something else
I've learned in 1 8 years of marriage.
Guys, when it comes to romance,
don't be in a hurry.
Because women are like diesel engines.
What I mean by that is it may take
a little while to get them warmed up.
But once you do...
...they can run a long, long time!
Whereas men, on the other hand,
are more like...
...bottle rockets.
You guys have been great. Thanks
for listening to me. I appreciate it.
Thank you very much.
I want you to do me a favor.
Keep this going.
Bring my buddy Bill Engvall
out here one more time. Billy!
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jeff Foxworthy, right there!
Keep it going. Bring back Ron White
and Larry the Cable Guy!
Ain't they great?
They are. You guys
have been simply awesome.
Bless your hearts.
Bless your hearts.
I gotta tell you...
...this show has been the most fun thing
I have ever done in show business.
The first night we started doing this,
we had no idea of how to close it.
When you're a comedian, the greatest
thrill in the world is making people laugh.
Your adrenaline goes so much...
...that there's no way
you can go to sleep at night.
We've all been friends
for about 1 5 years.
So we have spent so many nights
at the Waffle House...
...at 2:00 in the morning,
sitting around and telling stories.
So we decided that's the way
we would close this thing every night...
...is to come out and tell stories that
made each of us laugh through the years.
Everybody's got great stories, but...
...ying-yang, here....
You gotta tell the story about when
you took your sister to the flea market...
...because she was all bummed out.
Remember that?
I hope she's hot!
Yeah, she'd make Ray Charles flinch.
-My sister--
-You sick bastard!
My sister is covered with moles.
She's got moles all over her face,
bunch of moles.
And we used to call her "Old Moley."
But she went down to church and got saved.
Now we call her " Holy Moley."
It ain't funny, to be honest with you.
But she was feeling bad about her moles,
so we figured we'd lift her spirits.
Took her up to the flea market
to get her something nice.
She's already feeling bad
about her moles...
...and then the night before,
she got this horse and it busted its leg...
...and I had to shoot it.
And now it's got a broken leg
and a gunshot wound.
I don't know what you're supposed
to shoot it for.
I guess it helps in the healing process
or something. I ain't sure.
If it ain't better by next week,
I'm gonna shoot it again.
But we's at the flea market--
My grandma couldn't make it up there.
She got arrested at the bass pro shop.
She was eating a corn dog
and got the farts in there.
They accused her of stealing a duck call
and some stink bait at the bass pro shop.
It's ridiculous.
She didn't even have any pockets
on that nightgown she was wearing in there.
So we's up at the flea market...
...and my sister is feeling bad
about her moles.
She's complaining all day long
about her moles.
"My moles this. My moles that."
So we walk past this feller
up there at flea market.
Got no legs.
All right? Selling boots.
That's right. Got no legs,
half an arm, one ear.
His name was Lucky.
So I told my sister,
"Listen, Dee Wayne." I said:
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
You ought to be ashamed.
'Cause here's a feller got no legs,
selling boots...
...whistling, enjoying himself...
...and you is complaining
about a few moles.
Be thankful for everything
the Lord give you."
And she said, "You're right. I ought
to be thankful for what the Lord give me."
She started to get a little extra hitch
in her giddyup.
Started smiling a little more. As soon
as we passed that feller with no legs...
...I heard him say to his buddy, "Good Lord!
Did you see the moles on that girl's face? "
That's right. True story.
Larry, thank you so much
for sharing that with everybody.
Makes you feel better
about your family, don't it?
Yeah. Kind of like going
to the state fair every time--
Feel better about your own relatives.
It's Ron's turn.
I'll let you guys pick tonight.
He can either tell....
Either the story about when they put
the BENGAY in his grandmother's girdle...
...or the time he got thrown
out of the bar in New York City.
-We gotta go with the bar.
-New York.
All right, New York.
I got thrown out of a bar
in New York City.
When I say I got thrown out of a bar...
...I don't mean somebody
asked me to leave...
...and we walked to the door together...
...and I said, "Bye, everybody,
I gotta go."
Six bouncers hurled me out of a nightclub
like I was a Frisbee.
Those big old New York bouncers
that think bouncing is a cool job to have...
...they just think about bouncing.
They hang out with other bouncers
talking about bouncing.
They go home every night, watch
Road House and fondle themselves.
I walk into a bar with a hat on.
This guy, real pissy, goes,
"Take off the hat!"
I'm like, "What's the deal? "
He goes, "I'll tell you what the deal is.
Gay people in this area wear hats.
We're trying to keep them out of our club."
I was like, "Really?
The only way we can tell in Texas...
...is if they have their hair cut
like yours."
And he got all pissed.
But he walked away,
I took the hat off.
An hour later, I'd been drinking
and I forgot.
You ever forget? It happened to me.
I put the hat back on.
The guy comes over to me.
I'm between 6' 1 " and 6'6", depending
on which convenience store I'm leaving.
I weigh 230 pounds.
The guy comes over, poking me in the
shoulder with two fingers and says, "Out!"
I'm like, "l don't think so, Scooter."
And I was wrong.
They hurled me out of that bar.
They squared off with me in the parking lot
and I backed down from the fight...
...because I don't know how many of them
it would have taken to whip my ass...
...but I knew how many
they were gonna use.
That's a handy little piece
of information to have.
They called the police because
we broke a chair on the way out...
...and I refused to pay for it
because we broke it over my thigh.
The cops showed up,
and at that point...
...I had the right to remain silent...
...but I didn't have the ability.
And the cop says, "Mr. White,
you are being charged with drunk in public."
I was like, "Hey, hey, hey.
I was drunk in a bar.
They threw me into public.
I don't wanna be drunk in public.
I wanna be drunk in a bar...
...which is perfectly legal.
Arrest them."
He didn't arrest them. Instead,
he made me do a field sobriety test.
You stand on one foot, raise the other foot
six inches off the ground...
...and count to thirty.
I made it to:
"ls that gonna be close enough? "
It wasn't close enough,
so they call in for my arrest record.
There's some good news.
Satellites are linking up in outer space...
...computer banks at NASA are kicking on...
...there's a telegraph
in Fritch, Texas, going:
This part takes a while.
Shorthand.
Now, I told you that story
to tell you this story.
When I was 1 7 years old,
I was arrested for being drunk in public.
There kind of seems
to be a pattern there, Ron.
If you knew Morse code,
you'd already know that.
And one DWl, which was
a bogus charge because it turns out...
...they were stopping every vehicle
traveling down that particular sidewalk...
...and that's profiling.
And profiling is wrong.
On the drunk in public charge
in Fritch, Texas...
...the arresting officer, who I had
literally known all my life. You know?
This guy lived four doors down from me
in a town of less than 400 people.
We've met.
He takes me to jail. When we get there,
he asks me if I have any aliases.
And I was just being a smart-ass
and said, "Yeah. They call me...
...Tater Salad."
Seventeen years later
in New York City...
...I'm handcuffed on a bench
with blood coming out of my nose...
...and this cop goes,
"Are you Ron 'Tater Salad' White? "
"You caught me!
You caught the Tater."
Thanks a lot. Thank you very much.
Love that story.
It is your turn,
and you don't get a choice.
You have got to do some
"Here's your sign" jokes.
Thank you.
I had the great opportunity this year
to take my family to the Winter Olympics.
It was great being an American
and being in our home country.
We were renting a car up in Salt Lake City,
and it's got a ski rack on it.
We was putting the skis up in the rack.
The guy at the car next to me goes,
"You going skiing? "
I said, "Nope, we put them on top of the car
in case we flip over on an icy road.
Here's your sign."
This last year, I went elk hunting.
I got me a nice one, had it hung
on the den wall in the house.
My neighbor comes over and goes,
"Did you shoot that thing? "
I said, "Nope, he ran
through the wall and got stuck.
Here's your sign."
Tell them about the one when we did
the show in Buffalo. When they lost the--
Oh, God!
We did this show up in Buffalo, New York,
and we land at the airport.
We go to get our luggage,
and mine didn't show up, which happens.
So I go down to the lost luggage office
where everybody is in such a good mood.
Who applies for that job?
Who says,
"l wanna work in lost luggage? "
You don't have a good day.
That's like having a job emptying
Port-a-Potties. You'll catch crap all day.
That is beautiful.
Did you just make that up?
-It's beautiful.
-I like to use analogies in my show.
That's where they compare things.
"That's funny. I don't care who you are,
right there. That's funny, right there."
So I'm trying to be nice to this woman
in the lost luggage office.
I said, "Excuse me."
She goes, "Can I help you? "
I said, "Yes, ma'am,
you lost my luggage."
She looked me right in the eye
and said, "Has your plane landed yet? "
Swear.
I said, "No, princess,
I'm having an out-of-body experience.
I'm just checking on it.
Here's your sign."
I hate to stop you,
but I've got one for you...
...and I know you have
so many of these things.
This happened to me last week. We're
in the process of remodeling our house.
We've been doing it for a while.
We have the painters in there.
They're putting sheets over the furniture.
And we have a regular,
up-against-the-wall piano.
Last week, one of the painters says to me,
" Is that y'all's piano? "
"No, that's our coffee table.
It just has buckteeth.
-Here's your sign."
-He did not.
I'll keep that one.
I'm gonna keep that one.
Let me try one of these Bill Engvall,
"Here's your sign" deals.
I'm sorry. I did not mean to start this.
No, you can use this.
Your next album will go aluminum.
My grandma is covered with moles.
Oh, my!
No. My grandma recently
just passed away.
Hundred and four years old.
That's right.
But they saved the baby.
I don't think he's kidding.
My grandma just passed away,
1 04 years old.
So I go up there to the flower feller
to get her flowers...
...and a card up there
at the flower feller.
-Wait. No, wait.
-And I was walking in there--
You bought a card
for your dead grandmother?
They had them there.
I know I'm gonna regret this.
What did it say?
"Get well soon."
I knew it was coming. I knew it!
So anyway....
But anyway....
Hundred four years old. Passed away.
I go up there to the flower feller.
He said, "What is this for? "
I said, "My grandma passed away at 1 04."
He said, "Oh, 1 04!
How'd she die? "
How'd she die? She's 1 04!
"She wrecked her Harley
up here at Bike Week.
Here's your sign."
I love it!
It was better than I thought
it was gonna be.
Bill?
Bill? I got one.
My son...
...Tater Tot...
...is covered with moles.
My son, when he was 6 years old, was
gonna fly by himself from Dallas to Austin...
...to be with his grandmother.
I'm putting him on the plane,
his grandmother's taking him off.
The lady I was buying
the ticket from says:
"ls there gonna be somebody in Austin
to pick him up when he gets off the plane? "
I said, "No, I'll pin a $20 bill to his collar
and wish him the best of luck.
Here's your sign."
Those were three good ones.
-Bill, what do you say you try one?
-Yeah, let me give it a shot.
A couple weeks ago,
my car broke down.
I was on the side of the road, the hood up,
smoke pouring out of the motor.
This guy stops to see if I'm all right,
but he asks the stupid question.
He goes, "Did your car break down? "
"Nope. Car wanted a cigarette,
so I pulled over.
Here's your sign."
I was in the store buying some pants.
I put the pants up on the counter...
...and the girl behind the counter goes,
"You gonna buy those? "
"Nope, gonna steal them. Just wanted you
to see them before I left the store."
Tell them about the one that you
done did over at what-you-call-her.
"Yeah, Bill, tell us about the one
you done did over at that deal there."
He just ended a sentence
in nine prepositions.
He's an overachiever.
I don't know about all that,
but tell it.
I know the one you're talking about.
All right.
I came out of the mall one day.
The guy parked next to me is standing there
with a coat hanger in his window.
And I could not stop myself.
I said, "You lock your keys in your car? "
He said, " Nope. Just washed it,
gonna hang it up to dry.
Here's your sign."
But the best one....
The best one I've seen yet
happened in Los Angeles, California.
I got stuck behind a big rig that wedged
his trailer up underneath an overpass.
Me and the trucker are waiting
on the tow truck driver.
The highway patrolman pulls up and looks
at the guy's rig and at the trucker.
I'm thinking, "Dear God, he can't say it."
'Cause I'll start laughing.
Sure enough, he goes,
"You get your truck stuck? "
God bless this trucker,
without missing a beat, he goes:
"Nope. I was delivering that overpass
and I ran out of gas.
Here's your sign."
Thank you.
Well, folks, I can speak
for the rest of these guys.
This has been one of the most
awesome nights of my life.
And I know it's been good for y'all,
but I know...
...you won't leave this room until you hear
some "You might be a redneck!"
If you think 'N Sync
is where your dirty dishes are...
...you might be a redneck.
If you take your dog for a walk
and you both use the tree at the corner...
...you might be a redneck.

mother-in-law's bra size...
...you might be a redneck.
If your dad's cell number
has nothing to do with a telephone...
...you might be a redneck.
If you keep a fly swatter
on the front seat of the car...
...so you can reach your kids
in the back seat of the car....
They're like, "Can you do that?
Is that okay? " No. Don't do that.
If your working television sits on top
of your non-working television...
...you might be a redneck.
If you've ever been accused
of lying through your tooth...
...you might be a redneck.
If you work without a shirt on
and so does your husband...
-...you might be a redneck.
-I like that.
If an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger
changed your life...
...you might be a redneck.
If you've ever worn a tube top
to a funeral home...
-...you might be a redneck.
-Oh, my God!
I can't even believe
you just said that one.
-Why? Did you see that?
-No.
No. I got one better.
If you've ever opened a beer
during a eulogy...
...you might be a redneck.
-I'm guessing one of your relatives.
-My uncle Jack.
I swear to you, Jeff, we were sitting--
We weren't even outside.
We were in the church.
The reverend had just finished
the eulogy and we heard:
We look in the back, he's sitting there
with a beer and he goes, "What? "
"Mama looks good, don't she? "
"That ain't Mama."
"No, that's her.
They just shaved her beard off."
Oh, my God.
"Forgot my beer."
As long as you're telling ones
on your relatives, I'm telling one on you.
This is one he did, and it's
about 1 2 years ago, in lowa.
I want you to think back.
A couple of DJs told me about this.
If you have ever ridden
an electric floor buffer...
-...you--
-All right, wait!
Tequila was involved, get off me.
I wonder how many times
his wife has said that.
One more on you.
If you ever empty the bed
of your pickup truck...
...by driving backwards really fast
and slamming on the brakes...
-That's how we moved.
-...you might be a redneck.
If you've ever used a bar stool
for a walker...
...you might be a redneck.
If you think Silence of the Lambs
is what happens...
...when Larry walks out to the barn....
"That's funny. I don't care who you are,
that's funny. Get her done!"
If there is an electronic singing fish...
...in more than three rooms
of your home...
...you might be a redneck.
If you missed fifth-grade graduation
because you had jury duty...
...you might be a redneck.

at 65 miles an hour...

you have something in your teeth...
...and you take them out
to see what it is...
...you might be a redneck.
If you have a complete set
of salad bowls...
...and they all say "Cool Whip"
on the side...
...you might be a redneck.
If you wear a dress that is strapless
with a bra that isn't...
...you might be--
Think about that
and try to sleep tonight, all right?
If you ever stared at a can of orange juice
because it said "concentrate"...
...you might be a redneck.
If you've ever had your nipple
bitten off by a beaver...
...you might be a redneck.
God bless you.
Thank you so much.
God bless you. You guys are awesome.
Thank you.
Those scratchers good?
Can I borrow it for one second?
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!
Oh, that does good!
Wash that off real good
when you get home.
-Got something for Larry's Christmas.
-Let's see what it does.
Fart detected! Fart detected!
Who's the actor here?
There are no actors here. Believe me,
this is an actor-free environment.
I could Halloween in these things.
Look at that.
-I feel like a hundred pesos.
-Look at this!
No? No.
Kiss your neck.
Come on, guys. It's show time!
And now, I'd like to do a little something
from my honeymoon.
I'm doing a book signing in Alabama.
This guy comes up and said,
"Will you personalize it? "
I said, "I'll write whatever you want."
He said, "l want you to write:
'To Josh, please quit flicking your boogers
in your daddy's truck.'"
I'm trying to make conversation with the guy
and I said, "How old is your son? "
Thinking he's gonna say four or five.
And he goes, "22."
-2786. All right, big fella.
-Hold on, they're still flying.
This is stupid.
What do they do with these?
Take them to Hooters.
-I could sell used cars in Texas.
-You could.
Earlier today, we were in Victoria's Secret.
This is from Rhonda's Secret.
I found something that will remind you
of your prom night.
I'll have the Texas cheese steak.
The hash browns, I want with...
...cheese, onions, chilies,
jalapenos and hot sauce.
-What is wrong with you?
-What?
Does your cardiologist know
that you eat this way?
Believe me, Fox,
I didn't get to where I am today...
...worrying about what I was
gonna feel like tomorrow.
You're gonna let me die, aren't you?
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, no!
Go down there and stand like that,
and I swear I'll get it right by you.
How do you do this?
You son of a bitch!
This is beautiful. Look at this.
You might be a redneck if you've
ever slept in the Waffle House.
I'd like to go on the record and say...
...I don't think any of this is funny.
The director of this film
is easily amused.
Saddle that cow.
I'm gonna ride it till it spits.
Don't tell nobody I done that.
That's just for you.
