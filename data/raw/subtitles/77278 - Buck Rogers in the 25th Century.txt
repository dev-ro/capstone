About 25 seconds. We have
complete clearance for launch.
- We are go. Twenty.
- Ten, nine, eight...
- seven, six, five...
- Ignition sequence starts...
Four, three, two, one, zero.
In the year 1987, at the
John F. Kennedy Space Center...
NASA launched the last of
America's deep space probes.
The payload perched on the nose
cone of the massive rocket...
was a one man exploration vessel.
Ranger 3.
On board this compact
starship a lone astronaut...
Captain William "Buck" Rogers...
was to experience cosmic forces
beyond all comprehension.
An awesome brush with death.
In the wink of an eye, his life
support system were frozen by...
temperatures beyond imagination.
Ranger 3 was blown out of
its planned trajectory...
into an orbit a thousand times more vast.
An orbit which was to return the
ship full circle to its point of origin.
It's Mother Earth...
not in five months, but in 500 years.
For 500 years, Buck Rogers drifted
through a world in which...
reality and fantasy merged
into a timeless dream.
Alert! Alert!
Incoming hostile ship.
Clear all launch channels for attack.
Wait!
There's something about the ship.
I've not seen anything like it.
Prepare to take in in tow.
Envelop alien ship in force field...
and prepare her for
boarding the Draconia.
- Neurosystems transport.
- In transport.
Begin heart-lung procedure.
- Dilute a minor pressure agent.
- Transmitting.
Increase diogen and
crystalline in proportion.
Heart-lung response up
on 0.2 and increasing.
We're starting to receive
positive neurological signals.
He's alive.
Enter.
And what about our intruder is so
important, it could not wait, Kane?
The man lives.
I'm not sure why.
You're not sure why.
Is this a puzzle for me to decipher?
The puzzle is for me to decipher.
The ship is antiquated... unlike
anything I've seen in the star system...
or outside of history
books for that matter.
Kane, please.
He was frozen in a
combination of gases.
Oxygen, cryogen, ozone, metalon.
Almost a perfect balance.
Were these techniques use throughout the
galaxy for terminal illness and disease.
Yes, today.
However, there is another matter.
The man's ship.
Kane, you have one more minute.
His instrumentation was stopped...
frozen solid in the year 1987.
- Are you telling me...?
- That the man may be 500 years old.
- You're serious?
- Yes.
Frozen by elements so
instantaneous and perfect...
that he is fully preserved and living.
It's a fascinating thought.
- Preserved young or preserved old?
- Very young.
Any defects from the ordeal?
Fortunately for him, we're
quite advanced in cryogenics.
Well, I've never met a 500 year old man.
Prepare him for an audience.
I'm afraid he's liable
to be not too coherent.
I'll make allowances.
- Where I am?
- We ask the questions.
Who are you?
Captain Buck Rogers,
United States Air Force.
- Who are you?
- What did he say?
Something about a united states.
Captain, what is your destination?
- What is it?
- My head.
- Could I get an aspirin?
- What does he mean?
Probably some kind of anti-pain drug.
Give him something for his discomfort.
What is this place?
Where am I?
Who are you?
You're aboard the king's
flagship Draconia...
under command of the
royal princess Ardala.
- Who?
- Where are you from.?
No. Wait, wait, wait.
Slow down.
What was that about a ship?
One of the king's fortresses on its
way to Earth on a peace mission.
On its way to Earth?
You mean you guys aren't from...?
I mean, we're not...
We're not on Earth?
I'm definitely going
to need that aspirin.
- Give it to him.
- Wait a second.
Oh!
Captain.
Bear in mind that you're a captive...
of a dynasty that has
conquered 3/4 of the universe.
You will answer carefully
if you value your life.
Are you a real life princess?
I think we've given our captain
a little too much medication.
No, no, I feel great.
The United States of America...
It was an empire on the planet
Earth some centuries ago.
Those royal tutors gave
you your money's worth.
Well, you're from Earth, Kane.
You should know better than I.
The United States had
perished almost 500 years ago.
Well, that would account for his
spacecraft, his clothes, the instruments.
I have a better explanation.
I think he's a very clever plant...
from the Federal Directorate of Earth.
- A plant?
- Yes.
An spy placed in our
path by their military.
They wouldn't dare. We come as a
royal envoy from my father's kingdom.
I am fully aware of your
father's stated purpose.
The guarantee trade between
Earth and the Draconian dynasty.
What possible reason could they
have in placing a spy on board?
To search our ship.
- To see if we're armed.
- I see.
- We couldn't allow that, could we?
- No.
Then I'm to assume that I may
dispose of Captain Rogers as I see fit.
How you handle security
is your prerogative.
Come on, Tiger Man.
What a layout!
Wow!
- And how are we this morning?
- Terrific.
Hey! That's a coincidence.
I got a ship just like this.
Disconnect the medication.
Oh, don't do that.
I really love it.
- You'll be on your way very shortly.
- Great. Where are we going?
- You're going home.
- Great. Where is that?
- On Earth.
- Oh, right!
Your ship has been serviced and
reprogrammed to take you home.
- I sure you must be anxious.
- Oh, yeah.
Seems like I haven't
been there for weeks.
Oh. Oh.
I must be having a great
time with you guys.
You know I'm going to miss you.
Hey! I got a great idea.
Why don't we all go
down there together?
You go on ahead.
We'll be along in a few days.
Not if I wake up.
Bye bye.
Oh, am I dreaming this?
Boy, they're going to be surprised back in
Houston when I come back with this story.
Battery.
Prepare to launch
the alien vessel.
Five seconds to launch.
Four...
three two...
one. Launch.
It's given us the perfect opportunity
to test the Earth's defense shield.
What do you mean test it?
We know that anyone
entering the earth surface...
without a clearance is
immediately incinerated.
But if our captain is
a spy, as I believe...
they will escort him
through the shield...
along the narrow channel
only known to their military.
Well, how can this help us?
I've hidden a micro-transmitter
aboard Captain Rogers' ship...
which will send back the
equivalent of a guide map.
When we give the signal...
that guide map will be used by
your father's attack forces...
to pour through their defense shield.
What if our Captain
Rogers is not a spy?
Then, he will burn.
I see.
You don't look very pleased.
Of course I'm pleased.
It's just that I have this strange feeling
I'm going to see Captain Rogers again.
Air control 1 to vessel Able, Baker 4.
Approach inner city a further 3/4.
Over.
What is your current
positioning and fuel supply?
Confirmed.
This is Tartalia near the air control Long.
We are approximately...
They do things...
they don't do, oh no...
Houston Control, this is Flight 711.
Come in, Houston Control.
Put down your cards and
your backgammon boards.
Lucky Buck is back.
Ah... Sir. Super?
Super on.
What station is this?
Delta sector, sir.
You don't hear from me very often.
Yes, yes Delta sector?
My scanners monitor the low
frequency direct communication band.
I'm picking up some
voices or something.
I'm sure you're picking up
pirate or maraudic chatter.
Nothing to be alarmed about.
Probably echoes from last
night's attack on our freighters.
Those signals will be
bouncing around all week.
Yes sir. I mean, no sir.
This isn't an echo, sir.
It's a voice. A strong voice.
It's singing.
- Singing?
- Yes.
- Delta sector, did you say "singing"?
- Yes.
Operational control, this is
Supervisor 14 on the floor.
Feed me to Delta sector.
Come in, Houston Control.
Come in.
Houston Control, this is Flight 711.
Come on you guys. You read me?
Give me some instructions.
I'm on final reentry.
Come in, Houston Control.
Houston Control, do you read me?
Hey! Come on you turkeys, get off
your duff and give me some info.
It's practically a foreign language.
Maybe some kind of joke?
It's heading directly to the
defense shield. Get me Intercept.
Intercept squadron
on the line, please.
Colonel Deering.
What are the coordinates?
Right. We're targeting the shield
100 miles to identify the craft.
Alert, Intercept airborned.
Position of alien craft.
- Very odd.
- What's odd?
The target seems to be
moving unusually slow
and erratic for any
conventional spacecraft.
I have target in visual sight.
What is it?
Hey, alright.
I see you...
guys.
Who are you?
What are you?
Attention, alien spacecraft.
Do you read?
Why do call an "alien"? You don't
look so familiar yourself, you know.
Who are you?
Please restrict your answers to "yes"
or "no". You're in grave danger.
From who?
You?
You are traversing a narrow
corridor into our inner cities.
Inner what? Look, lady...
Colonel Deering.
Now, please be quiet.
If you deviate from my orders by
so much as a thousand yards...
you will be burned into
vapour, do you understand?
Vapours? Yeah yeah, I understand.
What do I do?
- Do you have manual override capabilities?
- Sure.
Then, follow me very closely.
Be right on your tail.
Really blow it this time.
Gotta be the Russians.
You're doing just fine.
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm just trying to be friendly.
Violating our airspace is an
act of war, not friendship.
Now wait until the guys
at the Cape hear this.
Buck Rogers sets down in
the middle of Red Square.
Air Control 1 access.
Clear on Corridor 1-0
Able for incoming vessel.
Confirmed. Outer barriers
all clear for approach...
in the Corridor 1-0 Able
for incoming vessel.
Hey, babe. This is quite a setup.
It's Colonel Deering,
Commander of Earth Defenses.
- Then you're in charge of all this?
- That's right.
- Now, if there are no more questions...
- Why, Colonel, take it easy.
I'd fly with you anytime.
- Take this barbarian in for interrogation.
- What?
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!
Wait!
What you... What are you doing?
Hey wait!
How do you do, Captain Rogers?
My name's Dr. Huer.
And I'm very pleased to meet you.
Just what's going on?
Where am I and what
are you doing to me?
Well, we're studying you.
It's all electronic and painless.
But so far we're as boggled
as you are by what happened.
Your testing is producing
the most phenomenal data.
Terrific.
But what is happening?
Cos if I'm dead, I obviously
didn't make it to heaven.
So just what planet is this?
What planet?
Oh, it's Earth, of course.
You returned as your
mission required...
to almost the precise landing area
originally programmed into your ship.
Aah, look, Doc.
I've been through a lot...
but there is no way
you can tell me that...
that city out there is
anything like Chicago.
No, it isn't. There's nothing
like Chicago left on Earth.
Allow me to bring in my
administrator, Dr. Theopolis.
Now look, Doc...
Twiki, would you bring
in Dr. Theopolis, please?
- What is that?
- It is Twiki.
- He's your drone.
- My what?
Well, for the duration of your
debriefing and determination...
Twiki will act as your aide.
And this...
This is Dr. Theopolis.
Good morning, Dr. Theopolis.
Lovely day.
Thank you.
I did my best.
Dr. Theopolis here is a
member of our Computer Council.
And in addition to other things,
he is personally responsible...
for all our environmental controls
here within the Inner City.
This introducing a pale hint of
mauve into the sunset this evening.
Not so deep as an amethyst...
but the more subtle burn
texture of cinnamon.
Well, how nice.
I do hope our captain
can watch it with us.
It's truly going to be lovely.
If I were you, I'd check in with
whoever's programming that thing.
Captain Rogers, it is
we on the Council...
who do the programming
for the entire city.
And kindly reserve your opinion.
Shall we get down to cases?
Captain Rogers, I... I'll leave
you with a word of advice.
These quads are not
programmed by man.
They've been programmed by
one another over for generations.
You see, the mistakes we have made...
in areas, well, like
our environment...
have been entirely
turned over to them.
And they saved the
Earth from certain doom.
Little by little, bringing us
back, so that we will not have
to depend entirely on other
planets for our food and water.
The quads are not human, but...
you can hurt their feelings.
It's this sensitivity that
separates them from mere machines.
So, I'll see you again in
approximately 16 hours.
16 hours?
Wait a minute!
Do you think I'm going to sit here
and talk to a box for 16 hours?
Sit down, captain. Let's both try
to be as pleasant as possible.
That's a good fellow.
Be a good drone, Twiki, and
place me on the table...
where I can get a good
look at the captain
while you get him some
liquid refreshment.
Well, that's alright. I don't
need any liquid refreshment.
Of course you do.
You're extremely dehydrated
from your ordeal, Buck.
If I may call you Buck.
Now run along Twiki and get
Captain Rogers his drink.
Well now...
what an attractive man you
are, Captain Buck Rogers.
Now look...
I've been waiting 24 hours...
to find out where I am,
who I am, who you are.
Can I have some answers?
Certainly, Buck. That's why I'm
here, to answer your questions.
Great. Let's have it.
Well, you are Captain Buck Rogers,
and according to your ship's log...
You left Earth in 1987.
That much I know.
Tell me what I don't know.
Well, if preliminary data holds up,
it appears you have returned
to Earth 504 years later.
You are now in the 25th century.
Buck? Are you alright, Buck?
Did you hear me?
Buck?
I think I want a drink now.
You can take my word. He's
a wonderful man. Believe me.
I do believe, that you believe
that he's a wonderful man...
but you're not being asked
to risk the lives of our few
surviving warriors
on his subterfuge.
He is only one man. What can he
possibly do to endanger our people?
He could attempt to discredit
the treaty with Draconia.
But he has made no such attempt.
He comes to us a bewildered man.
I would like the opportunity to
spend some time with our captain.
If you're hoping to find fault with his
testimony, you'll waste your time.
Saving Earth cannot
be a waste of time...
despite having to endure
the captain's company.
Well, if Dr. Theopolis has
no objections... I have none.
I have no objections.
And the captain belongs
to me until I expose him.
I have not seen Colonel Deering...
so uncharacteristically
emotional about anything before.
Nor anyone.
This part seems more of
a dream than a nightmare.
Look, I was a little loud yesterday.
I'd like to apologize.
I accept your apology, captain.
Tell me about the holocaust.
I can't.
Well, until I hear it and feel it.
It isn't real.
Look, I lost everything
that was important to me.
A mother, father, brothers,
sisters, a woman I cared for.
And until I hear something
that convinces me different...
they're waiting for me right now,
somewhere else in time and space.
- What's it like on the outside?
- Outside the city? You wouldn't like it.
- Radiation?
- In some places.
Ruins and scorched
earth everywhere else.
That's why we're so dependent
on trade with other planets.
This trade agreement with the Draconians
and the princess. What's that all about?
We're being starved out by pirates
who choke off our shipping lines.
The Draconians have promised to
keep our supply lines open...
in return for landing
privileges here on Earth.
I'd like to see my ship.
Is that possible?
Anything is possible, captain.
Those guards thought we were crazy
coming out here at this hour of the night.
I've had enough sleep
to last me a lifetime.
Do you recognize these markings?
Fairly common for an aircraft
that had been in combat.
Well, I wasn't in combat.
Did your ships fire on me?
- Certainly not.
- Then who did?
Possibly pirates who've
been attacking our shipping.
And why am I still here?
Why didn't they finish me off?
Why didn't they strip the
ship or at least open it?
You'd think pirates would be thorough
enough to check out an unarmed ship...
particularly one they
bothered to fire on.
You've been in flight a long time.
Anything could have happened.
Yeah, well those burns are fresh.
The cordite is still unoxidized.
I think Princess Ardala's
attack fighters fired on me...
before they towed me aboard her ship.
- Her ship is unarmed. That is the law.
- Yeah well, she seems to be bending it.
What would you suggest, Captain?
I would suggest thoroughly
searching her ship
before you allow it inside
your defense shield.
Rather an insulting way to begin
an alliance based on good faith.
Good faith is for bureaucrats.
It won't get you a city with a lid on it.
I'd go up there armed to
the teeth, full squadron,
otherwise you'll be sitting ducks.
For a man whose expertise is
allegedly five centuries old...
you seem quite opinionated.
You're right.
It's none of my business
how you blow up your world.
My generation didn't know
what they were doing either.
- Good night, Colonel.
- Where are you going, Captain?
- I'm going to look around the city.
- You're suspicion. You can't.
I'd like to find out what's
changed in 500 years.
- That's forbidden.
- It's a free country. At least, it was.
Technically you're still under arrest
and my prisoner. I can't let you go.
You'll have to shoot
me to stop me, Colonel.
You leave me little choice.
You didn't have to
come with me, Theo.
I wanted to be with you, Buck.
I wish you'd listened to reasons.
This is nothing compared
to what lies ahead.
Why don't we stay here for the night?
Oh, I'm afraid we'd freeze to death.
What little warmth you feel is
emanated from the Inner City.
In a few hours, they cut
power by two thirds...
and it will drop well
below zero out here.
Well, it's straight
ahead then I guess.
I'm just sorry I brought
you guys into all this.
I was assigned to be with you.
No one forced me into your camp.
I believed in you...
and I still do.
- What is he saying?
- You don't want to know.
Oh!
- What's he saying now?
- You don't want to know.
You guys go back. I can put up
with whatever's out there...
if it helps me to find what
happened to my people.
I'm with you, Buck.
- What's he saying?
- You don't want to know.
Stop saying I don't want to know.
I want to know.
He thinks we're being watched.
It's just his imagination.
Come on.
- It's hopeless. Absolutely hopeless.
- Oh we'll be alright.
- It isn't you they're after.
- What?
No offense, but it's us.
My gold circuits and parts bring a
lot of money on the black market.
As for Twiki, well, I'd hate to
tell you the use they'll put him to.
Buck, where are you going?
STATE STREET
My God!
This is it.
I don't mean to impugn
your strategy, Buck...
but standing in the middle
of the street is stupid...
under the circumstance.
Come on!
- I don't know where he is going.
- Just follow him.
- I don't know what he's doing.
- Just follow him, Twiki.
- Holy...
- I know, Twiki.
- I see them.
- Just keep going.
Don't think thoughts like that.
You'll run down your batteries.
This is where my parents are buried.
Well, at least I know part of it.
We can't stay long, Buck.
We're being followed.
What happened?
There's only one stone, no date.
Only a few fortunate
ones were buried at all.
It happened so fast,
families were buried together.
Dates became unimportant
as all systems broke down.
Finally, there were no
more armies or fighting.
Only starvation, contamination
and lingering death.
- I wish I'd been with them.
- You can't go back, Buck.
The past is gone. But you can
still help us with our future.
If there is a future.
I'm afraid it's too late.
Take off, Twiki.
Watch out!
Dirty...
There's just too many of
them, Buck. It's hopeless.
If anyone has any last words, I
think now would be the time for them.
Let's get out of here.
Oh well, Colonel. What brings
you out on a night like this?
Captain, I came to find
you at some personal risk.
- Very ballsy.
- Very what?
Forget it. Well, don't
expect any fanfare.
We were doing just fine until
you came along. Right, Theo?
- Well...
- Forget it, Theo.
Well, at least Twiki is on my side.
Matter of fact,
I kind of like it out here.
It's a bit primitive, but then
it is the south side of Chicago.
Captain, we're wasting time.
Let's go.
I'm not through looking yet.
So unless you're
prepared to shoot me...
Captain, you got away once,
but not this time. Lieutenant.
What's wrong?
Then it's true, he's
working for the pirates.
I still don't believe it.
Well, you stand alone, Theo.
The micro-transmitter was attached
to his navigational equipment...
revealing our secret access
corridors to our enemies.
That's not the behaviour
of an innocent man.
At first I thought he
was guilty and then...
You're being subjective in
your evaluation of Buck Rogers.
I, on the other hand, support
him for very practical reasons.
- And what are they?
- I'm convinced of one thing.
Our friend, Captain Rogers, has
indeed met the Princess Ardala...
and has been aboard
the draconian flagship.
His descriptions are too precise...
to be the guesswork of a pirate.
Perhaps the pirates have been aboard her
ship and provided him with the information.
My dear, they are the
deadliest of enemies.
It is unlikely that any pirate could
survive such a visit to tell about it.
Word from Earth on Captain Rogers' fate.
His ship was intercepted and led down...
as I expected.
Did the transmitter we sneaked aboard his
ship provide the necessary information...
to bring my father's forces
through their defense shield?
Yes, however the transmitter
had been discovered.
- It's too bad.
- It makes no difference.
Once we're welcomed inside, we
will destroy the shield from within.
Won't the earthlings
be suspicious when.
Captain Rogers tells them
he was aboard our ship?
They won't believe him.
Captain Rogers is as good as dead.
Now stop worrying about the trial.
I'm a member of the Council and
I'm going to defend you personally.
Thanks, Theo. It's nice to
have at least one friend.
I'm sorry, Twiki.
Two friends.
The Computer Council is ready
to hear the final arguments...
in the case of the Directorate
versus Captain Buck Rogers...
on charges of espionage and treason.
- Councilor Apol.
- The State's is elementary.
Captain Rogers piloted a foreign
aircraft through our defense network...
with a micro-transmitter, revealing our
secret shield borders to our enemy.
What price you may ask...
What bounty would
Captain Rogers consider
just in selling out the human race?
Only he and his pirate
friends can answer.
But I submit that in my opinion...
it is the destruction of the treaty with
Draconia that they seek at all cost.
For its enactment spells their doom.
The State rests its case.
We will now hear from the defense.
Dr. Theopolis.
Distinguished colleagues,
you have heard the evidence...
and I challenge you
to find this man guilty.
No evidence has been found to suggest
his claim to a birthright on this planet...
because we all know full well...
no records exist prior
to the great holocaust.
He has no explanation as how a
transmitter got aboard his ship...
because it was not his doing.
He is an innocent pawn in a great war.
I say to you, my colleagues,
that if you find this man guilty...
you must find me guilty.
My sensors tell me
that this man is good.
The defense rests.
Thank you.
Captain Rogers, have you any last
words before we pass judgment?
Just that I'm an innocent pawn,
puppet, call it what you will.
Somebody else pulls the strings.
You'd be better advised to worry
less about me and more about them.
Because I can do you no more harm,
no matter what the outcome today.
But he or she...
could destroy you.
Very nice, Buck. We don't
have a thing to worry about.
By unanimous vote, the
Council finds for the State.
Captain Rogers, the
Council finds you guilty.
Your life is to be terminated.
Said termination will be
carried out immediately.
This council is adjourned.
I don't believe it.
Aren't you going to say anything?
- No.
- That's ridiculous.
You have been
sentenced for termination.
At the very least, I would think a man
of your sort would fly into a rage...
Lash out at me.
Say something.
Goodbye?
Buck, stop it!
You're being unreasonable.
I'm being unreasonable?
It is almost as if you don't think
the sentence will be carried out.
Well, as a matter of fact,
I don't think there's going
to be anyone around to
carry the sentence out.
At least I know you
people won't be in charge.
You're still clinging to your story
about the Draconia bearing arms.
I can prove it.
What would you say if I told you...
that I came here to
give you that chance?
How?
By flying out to meet the Draconia
flagship, to verify your story...
about them finding you.
And... do a little looking
around while you're there?
Exactly.
No no. I...
I don't like that plan.
- It worries me.
- Why?
Well, you see, I'm
scheduled for termination.
If I miss it, I might get
into a lot of trouble.
Buck! You are impossible.
I'm offering you your life and
you're giving me practical jokes?
Well, you see that's the point.
Are you offering me
termination of my termination...
or are you just postponing it?
If you can prove that
your story is true...
Let's go.
Stay close to my wing, Captain. We'll
keep the maneuvers nice and simple.
Stay on auto-flight. You won't be
expected to run anything but the throttle.
Thanks, colonel.
Is it alright if I occasionally
look out the window? Hmm?
This is no time for levity, Captain.
We've lost nearly a third of our
ships in this sector to pirates.
When they hit, they hit fast.
You can't out-fly the computer.
It will take any necessary evasive
action to avoid their missiles.
If you try to fly that thing,
you will only cost us a ship.
I appreciate your concern.
Just wish I had brought
along something to read.
I make a target vector 401.
Roger, Colonel. I have a
visual on target. Just to port.
If you have visual at this distance...
it must be gigantic.
Permission to come aboard?
Why?
A special envoy.
That's all I know.
It isn't according to protocol.
- What do you think they have in mind?
- I don't know.
But they have given us plenty of warning.
And there'll be nothing
in evidence to betray us.
I'll be curious to know
what they have in mind.
Let's prepare a very
special welcome for them.
Send out our pirate ships...
and arrange a little
surprise for them.
Welcome aboard the
flagship Draconia...
envoy of Draco, conqueror of space...
warlord of Astrium, ruler
of the Draconian realm.
I give you his daughter,
Princess Ardala.
Delighted.
This is an unexpected pleasure.
We are hardly prepared
to greet you properly.
Consider your time adequate greeting.
I'm Colonel Deering, Commander of the
3rd Force of the Earth Directorate.
And I believe you already
know Captain Rogers.
But no. If I had met so
dashing young captain...
I'm sure I would have
remembered vividly.
I don't believe we've
had the pleasure.
I think you're mistaken, princess.
I never forget a knuckle.
Captain!
Listen. We're here to get
to the bottom of things.
Would you like me to describe
some of your inner chambers?
Oh! What inner chambers
is he referring?
Well the princess may not find me
memorable, but I'll never forget her.
I especially liked the dress
with the high neck collar and...
Colonel Deering,
what is this all about?
Why are you here?
The pirate forces are at
their worst in this sector.
We brought our ships to
assure you safe arrival.
Alert! Alert! Alert!
Draconia under attack
by hostile ships.
And Captain Rogers...
All personnel to defense posts.
- Men, to your ships!
- Alert all stations. Secure the ship.
So this is how you
bid us safe conduct.
Find escort.
At least we'll all perish together.
Clear all launch channels for attack.
Alert! Alert!
Lay off, Bank! I got your tail.
Pull up! I'll cut him off.
There's no way you're diving
without any of those powers!
Captain Rogers, I ordered
you to stay out of this.
Colonel, you need all
the help you can get.
- Wing man! Man at 12 o'clock high.
- 12 o'clock what?
Lieutenant Wrather, disregard.
Captain Rogers, get off the air.
Our combat computers
are way ahead of you.
Well yeah Colonel, but if your computers
don't do something pretty fast...
your lieutenant Wrather
is going to be...
Watch out, Thornberry!
Colonel, you've got to
go to manual flight.
Buck Rogers, if you don't
stop distracting our pilots...
You just have a lieutenant and
a couple of pirates on your tail.
Colonel, I'm switching to manual.
See if I can start dishing out a
little of what we've been taking.
Buck Rogers, I'm ordering
you back to the base.
Nailed him... let's see how he like
a little old fashion red dogging.
One sack. Six to go.
Got you!
Colonel. Take it down.
Straight down and enter retro!
I can't! It goes against the
principles of modern aerial combat.
That's called bunching
your linebackers.
Look! I don't know what went wrong
with our combat computers but...
thank you.
Now, captain, let's go home.
- Mine or is it yours?
- What?
- What did you say?
- Just joking.
Air control 1 to access.
Clear on Corridor 1-0
Able for incoming vessel.
Confirmed. Outer barrier is
all clear for approach...
on Corridor 1-0 Able
for incoming vessel.
Colonel Deering. Have
you seen Captain Rogers?
Yes. Why?
Our Council has had a formal request
from Her Majesty Princess Ardala.
What has that got to
do with the captain?
Well, the princess feels
he single-handedly saved...
their unarmed vessel from
the renegade pirates...
and wants to thank him personally.
Single-handedly?
Apparently, even your
ship was nearly destroyed.
Were if not for Captain
Rogers' inordinate skills...
and quick thinking,
the princess feels...
I don't care what the princess feels.
I know what happened.
I was there.
Tomorrow I conquer Earth.
Tomorrow we conquer
Earth, your Highness.
You look magnificent, Buck.
Is something troubling you?
Why am I invited to this thing?
Nobody believes me.
Princess Ardala wants
to thank you personally
for fighting the
pirates off her ship.
And I'd had a word or two
with her myself... alone.
Oh! I'm sure that won't be permitted.
After all, you're only a captain.
And not even commissioned at that.
- What have you got for headache?
- A headache? Are you ill, Buck?
Oh! I guess I'm just not fully
recovered from that long trip yet.
Why didn't you say something?
Twiki will get you a relaxant.
Well, it's time to go in now.
We don't want to keep the
trade delegation waiting.
Welcome.
The Draconian trade delegation...
under the leadership of
Her Royal Highness...
Crown Princess of the realm.
Ardala.
I bring you greetings on
this historic occasion.
My father, King Draco...
would like to present to you
his own flagship Draconia...
filled with all the latest technology...
as a gift to symbolize
a new glorious era...
of commerce and peace.
Let the celebration begin.
- We brought you some pills, Buck.
- Hmm?
For your headache.
It's a very strong relaxant.
You mustn't take more
than one at a time.
Thanks guys.
Well, I see dancing has come
a long way in 500 years.
Listen. I'm going to need
something else. A rose.
- Did you say a rose?
- Yeah, a red one.
What do you need a rose for, Buck?
Twiki, would you go get
me one, quickly huh?
How do you like our
presentation, Captain Rogers?
Most impressive.
Did this folk dance come all
the way from her daddy's world?
Sorry, I don't think I
understand your terms.
And I would suggest a more
respectful reference than "daddy".
He's perhaps the greatest
leader the world has ever known.
Well, a word of caution, Colonel.
- Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.
- Greeks?
Maybe that was a little before
your time. Quite a while back.
Tell me, do you know the
story of the Trojan horse?
No.
No, huh?
Well, forget it.
I guess I came from a time
that was hopelessly paranoid.
See you around.
Your rose, Buck.
Oh! It's a nice one.
Thank you, Twiki.
Buck, no one else is giving
the princess flowers.
You're going to make
them all look ridiculous.
Stay close fellows. We're next.
Well, Captain Rogers.
Congratulations and thank you.
We're very grateful to you for saving
us from those horrible privateers.
Not too loud, my Princess.
Around here they think
I am a privateer. Thanks to you.
Me? Well, I hope I haven't
caused you too much embarrassment.
- Are you angry?
- On behalf of the...
- Theo!
- What a body.
- From me to you.
- Who's your charming little friend?
His name is Twiki.
Yes, and that thing hanging
around his neck is Theo...
Ex-officio member of
the Computer Council.
Your Majesty.
Would you care to join
me in the next dance?
- The princess does not...
- Does not mind to dance.
I don't think I'm too up on
these latest dance steps.
Well, if you have a preference...
It is my party.
Really. How about something
old-fashioned, huh?
Sir, excuse me. Are you
familiar with... rock? You know...
Try it, try it. Come on.
No, no, that's not it.
Just let yourself go.
Let it go. Go with the music.
That's right. Yeah.
What are you doing?
It's called getting down. It's a little
before your time, if it frightens you...
Nothing frightens me.
Yeah it's fine.
Get down and boogie.
It's expressive.
It's disgusting!
- What happens if we bump together?
- We automatically become man and wife.
Groovy. Get down.
You're quite a man, Captain Rogers.
I have the feeling the earth people
believe your incredible story...
about being frozen for 500 years.
- Not on your life. They think I'm a spy.
- One of mine?
- They're not sure.
- You want to join us?
- Who do I gotta see to make my move?
- Me.
Tell me, that building... Is it
still the communications center?
That would be secret information.
Of course.
I will always be one of you, Dr. Huer.
Perhaps I will remain
here... permanently.
We hope so.
Your Highness, some of ministers
would like a few minutes.
- Later, Kane.
- Business of the realm comes first!
Your father expects you to serve
the best interests of the realm.
If you don't...
he has 29 other daughters that will!
It's been a pleasure, Captain Rogers, but
I'm afraid our duties are cut out for us.
Later perhaps?
I depart aboard my
private launch at midnight.
I'll be there.
Captain Rogers.
I wonder if this wouldn't be
a good time to talk with you.
Princess Ardala left so abruptly...
and the party seems to be over.
You don't have any plans, do you?
- Well...
- Good.
I have something I would like to say.
Well, I...
I thought you were a
spy, Captain Rogers.
I was wrong.
Would you like to go some place?
I'm not up to that yet.
I have been out of it
for quite a while...
500 years.
I've got to go easy on reentry.
It's alright.
Now listen to her, fella.
She's making sense.
I've asked Captain Rogers to join us.
Lucky for you she called me on.
We're almost there.
Where are you going?
I know it's chilly, but
we've got no choice.
Our orders are to stay close to Buck.
And he may need us,
so back in the cooler.
Twiki, I'm speaking to you.
Ooh! Freezing my ball bearings off.
Captain Rogers is
just not to be found.
What do you expect from a primitive?
We'll let you know
if we hear anything.
You are a spy, Buck Rogers...
and I know exactly where you are.
Out!
They make better pets
if you had them fixed.
Let's make ourselves comfortable.
Pour us a drink.
At last we're alone.
Have you nothing to say?
Up until this moment I didn't
know what it was I'd been missing.
Well, I have a confession as well.
There's somebody else back home.
I didn't realized what I was missing.
You're different.
You're arrogant.
You flagrantly disregard orders.
And you're the kind of man
who could unseat my father.
Your father's seat is the
furthest thing from my mind.
I brought you here for a reason.
I was counting on that.
I want you by my side.
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind.
Consider it.
You have no idea what it's like being
the daughter of Draco the Conqueror.
29 sisters living at your heels.
Weasely little courtiers
like Kane vying for power.
But with a man...
a real man like yourself...
I could defy my father,
I could live my own life.
Oh?
A magnificent new dynasty.
Aren't we getting a
little ahead of ourselves?
I'll take that drink now.
We have to be very careful.
- Do we?
- Mm hm.
The timing is not good.
Things never change.
This is the way it's always been.
Why couldn't I have met
you sooner, Buck Rogers?
Well, we've got plenty
of time, don't we?
All armament personnel report to
flight bay to begin loading weaponry.
Look at them.
Down there sleeping.
The fools will never
know what happened.
I so relaxed.
Would you turn off the lights?
If you're a spy,
I'll have to kill you.
If that's an example of your best
pillow-talk, I think I found your problem.
This is no good, Twiki.
There are soldiers everywhere...
and we don't even know where to
begin to look for Captain Rogers.
Holy gee!
Let's see if we can
find your jammies now.
The pirate ships. So that's how
they were able to attack us.
It was their own people.
- Where's Tiger Man?
- I don't know, sir.
Go away!
Did they wake you, my darling?
Did they wake you,
my little baby prince?
Blast it!
Get it out! Get it out!
Get it out! Execute him!
- No. Remove him for questioning.
- You countermand my order?
Under the circumstances, yes.
Do as I say.
Take him.
You have a lot of explaining to do.
I have some explaining to do?
Well, it's not Gucci,
but what the hell!
I don't want to get caught either.
But something is very wrong and
we've got to find out what it is.
I hope you know this
violates my warranty.
You have quite obviously
been... preoccupied.
I will deal with you for
your insolence later.
Give the order to attack at once.
We cannot attack without your
father's forces to support us.
Kane, you're spineless!
We do not need my father.
We have the element of surprise.
We can wipe out the Inner City.
We can destroy the defense shield.
By the time my
father's forces arrive...
we'll be sitting on the
throne of the Earth.
At least I will, since you
obviously don't have the nerve.
Alright, we will attack.
A wise decision, Kane.
Meanwhile, Captain Rogers is
loose somewhere on this ship.
Find him.
Alert! Alert!
Outside intruder aboard ship.
Alert! Alert! Alert!
It's Buck.
I see him. He's wearing
the uniform of the enemy.
Well, this will warm your tail.
Those are warships out there.
That means the treaty is a hoax.
But we can do one last
service for our country.
We can deal with Captain Rogers.
Six minutes to attack and counting.
Five minutes to attack and counting.
- Don't move, Captain Rogers.
- Theo, Twiki, what are you doing here?
This isn't going to be
pleasant for anyone.
Will you guy get out of here?
I got work to do.
- We can see that, you traitor.
- Can't you see what's happening?
I'd say someone is
about to bomb Earth.
Do you recognize these ships?
No, but I don't see how
that's very important...
They're pirate ships.
Why would there be pirate ships
aboard the Draconian flagship?
I'm sorry. You'll have to do better
than that. Now come with us.
- 4 minutes to attack and counting.
- No.
Look! You half baked load
of electronic gibberish,
I don't expect you
to know everything...
but have you ever heard of loading
bombs into the tail pipe of a rocket ship?
You be quiet, Twiki.
I'm getting confused.
Maybe I can help unconfuse you.
There are no pirate ships.
There never were.
They are Draconian bombers
disguised as marauders.
They've been harassing
your shipping lanes
in order to force you into
a treaty with Draconia.
Of course!
It's ingenious, if true.
Three minutes to attack and counting.
You got about 10 seconds to make up your
mind who you believe in. Me or Kane.
- Some choice.
- And what about yourself?
Don't your circuits tell
you, I'm on the level?
Yes.
Alright, unless you want to consider
yourself somebody's spare parts,
why don't you go along
with your initial instincts.
Alright. But only on the condition
you help us get to a communicator...
so we can warn Inner City.
Well, you have to
do that on your own.
On the chance that
if you don't make it,
I got to make sure none of
these ships are ready to launch.
Commander Kane. I found a
guard unconscious in Bay 3.
- 2 minutes to attack and counting.
- Find somewhere to hide, Theo.
They found the guard I knocked out.
Now get out of here.
Alright. Alright. We'll do our part.
Good luck, Buck.
Take me over to the console, Twiki.
Now, grab the middle panel.
- Ninety seconds to attack and counting.
- Drop it.
Grab the circuits and pull them.
80 seconds to attack and counting.
70 seconds to attack and counting.
Put it close to the microphone.
60 seconds to attack and counting.
Earth Directorate, emergency channel.
Come in, please.
Colonel Deering online.
This is Dr. Theopolis.
Yes doctor.
Where are you?
How did you get on
this emergency channel?
I'm on board the flagship Draconia.
I followed Captain Rogers as ordered.
Now please listen.
The Draconia is not... repeat,
not an unarmed vessel.
She is filled with bombers
preparing to launch...
a full-scale military attack
against the Inner City.
But how? Where did they come from?
Their landing bay was empty.
Scramble your fighter squadrons now!
At once!
Thank you Doctor.
Good luck.
Dr. Huer, permission
to scramble fighters.
20 seconds to attack and counting.
Battle stations.
Fighters! Prepare to launch!
- 10 seconds to attack and counting.
- Standby to attack.
Eight, seven, six...
five seconds to launch.
Four, three...
two, one.
Attack!
What is it?
What's going on?
- Our ships. They simply exploded.
- That's impossible!
This is Earth Directorate.
Attack bombers as they launch.
We'll attack the main ship.
There are no bombers to attack.
They're exploding as they emerge.
That doesn't makes any sense.
Get our warships out there!
Prepare to intercept. Do not, I repeat,
do not use combat computers.
Disengaging.
Draconia on your wing.
Bank right! I'll get him!
We got two coming up from below.
I'll jump the one on the top.
I've got the other one.
Take that and that!
Oh, shit!
Alright! I'm going to hold you responsible
for any damage done to this bay.
I'm really sorry it
had to come to this.
Bottoms up!
Prepare to transmit
Person-Image of King Draco.
What, in the name of
the realm, is going on?
You are attacking while
my ships are still hours away?
I'm... just following orders.
And just whose orders
were you following?
Your daughter, sir.
And did she order our ships to
disintegrate as they enter battle?
If either of you survive this
greatest debacle our realm has known...
You will answer to me!
All squadron, disengage
from fighting warships,
and prepare to finish
off the mother-craft.
Emergency!
Emergency! Emergency! Emergency!
This was your doing, your Highness.
I oughta leave you here to
burn up with the ship...
But I want you alive to
answer to your father.
I have an emergency escape
shuttle, ready to leave now.
It'll take us far enough away
to reach your father's ship.
Emergency! Emergency! Emergency!
Emergency!
Emergency! Emergency!
The ship is ready to blow.
Withdraw all ships from the impact area.
Theo, I'm coming in to get you and Twiki.
- Forget us. Save Buck.
- Buck?
Wilma, he single-handedly destroyed
their entire fleet of warships.
- He sent us to warn you.
- Meet me there on the flight deck.
I'm going to find Buck.
Emergency! Emergency! Emergency!
Theo, Twiki, over here!
It's good to see you again, Buck.
Yeah, well cut out the formality.
This magazine's about to blow.
Help is on the way.
- What do you mean help?
- Wilma is coming in to get us.
What? She can't land here.
She'll be killed.
Emergency! Emergency!
- It's time to go.
- This way, Buck. Through the smoke.
Taxi cab! Taxi!
Let's get out of here.
That magazine's about to blow.
I'm with you.
Get in!
Very nice.
Thank you. But we're
not in the clear yet.
We would be rulers of Earth now...
if you hadn't let
Buck Rogers on board!
He wouldn't have been necessary
if you were more of a man.
We owe you a great deal more
than apology, Buck. Especially me.
I confess, I thought the
princess had you beguiled.
Well, I will say she had the
nicest set of... horns at the ball.
Yes, it was an attractive hat.
You'll never be the man Buck Rogers is.
We'll see when we
meet Mr. Rogers again.
And we will.
I hope so.
Buck...
I know I've been aloof
towards you... cold.
I was frightened,
afraid to get involved.
Things are going to be
different now between us.
I'm not all business.
I am every bit the woman
that the princess was.
That's nice.
And, from this moment on,
I'm going to prove it to you.
What?
Well, I guess that's the
last we'll see of Kane...
and the princess.
Wakey!
Eyes forward.
We'll get star sick.
Buck! You're my kind of guy.
