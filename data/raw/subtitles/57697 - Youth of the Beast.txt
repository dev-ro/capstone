"I shouldn't be in love
with a married man,
but he's everything to me.
I feel sorry for his wife,
but this is the only way
to make him mine.
I'm sorry, Mother. Tamiko"
A double suicide
brought on by the woman?
Lucky man to have a woman
who loved him that much.
I agree.
What kind of work did he do?
Chief.
"Police Detective Koichi Takeshita"
Hey, watch it!
Damn you! That hurts!
Be careful!
Any special girl you want?
What are you doing?
Bring the best.
Very well, sir!
Waiter, ice!
He's quite a playboy.
A very good customer.
He's already spent 70,000.
Who is it?
Somebody beat up Ken.
You guys take care of it.
He says it was a total stranger.
- Where's Ken?
- Outside.
Forget this stranger.
Just pay him off.
Maybe this guy
is from the Sanko mob.
They're no match for us.
Just forget it.
Get Ken in here.
Is that the man?
That's him!
The total is 72,500 yen.
- Any policemen around?
- Why do you ask?
Well, I've got no money.
Don't give us that bullshit!
Wait.
Let's settle this peacefully
in the office.
Stop.
He isn't packing.
This room is soundproof.
One false move and they'll blow you away,
so watch your step.
You're new.
Where are you from?
I hear you've been
messing around on our turf.
You got some grudge
against Nomoto Enterprises?
Spit it out or you'll get hurt.
I just felt like doing it.
If it had been this lady here,
I would've been gentler.
- Smart-ass!
- Shut your face!
Good thing it's soundproof.
Turn around.
- What for?
- Do as I say.
You stay here.
Get up.
Whatever they're paying you,
I'll double it.
How much?
One million yen up front.
You got it.
And 200,000 yen a month.
Then...
Did you think I was a hit man?
I just wanted a job.
Thanks for hiring me.
Good.
I'll introduce you to the boss.
You aren't the boss?
You keep wanting more!
But our area is a slum!
You can't ask for so much.
- That's enough!
NOMOTO RESIDENCE
You a killer?
I bet you're fast with guns.
I dislike such unreliable weapons.
I like to feel the results
with my own hand.
These are the best.
Put that away.
I don't like being shot in the back.
Take your hand off the gun.
Let's get rid of them together.
You've got a few things to learn.
So do you.
I'm Minami.
We'll get along fine.
We will. I'm Joji Mizuno.
Call me Jo for short.
Don't touch that!
He's never been able
to hold a gun in his left hand.
I wanna meet the boss.
I'm Nomoto.
You guys should act more respectable.
You still act
like yakuza off the street.
Minami,
I told you to wear a tie, didn't I?
You won't believe this,
but alcohol and women
are my weaknesses.
Where are you staying?
The Hibiya Hotel.
The Hibiya?
That's classy.
Can you afford it?
No, I'm broke.
So you're going to bilk them then?
You've got guts.
I'll pick up the tab for you.
Take care of him, Minami.
He looks useful.
Is he really at the Hibiya?
Forget it.
He won't be on your list.
Here he is.
- Oh, yeah?
From Abashiri, the prison town.
Just a moment, sir.
That's a hell of a suitcase!
- Nomoto runs this place too?
- Yeah.
Jo, what's in there?
Wanna report to your boss, huh?
The tools of my trade.
I take better care of them
than I do of myself.
Pretty impressive!
Come on.
I'll show you around.
Then on to your first job.
Let's see what you're capable of.
This is for you.
Hello. Good to see you.
- He's the new hand.
- Got a name?
Jo Mizuno, I think.
A bit of a maverick, but I hear he's good.
A shakedown!
- What?
- Where?
The realtors' office.
Some guy's blackmailing them.
What?
The deed.
Make out a check.
How the hell can I pay
three million yen?
Just write it out.
You can't threaten me.
You can't do anything to me.
Get out!
Okay, I'll write the check!
Hold it right there.
You almost pulled it off,
but you got a little overconfident.
To hell with your plan!
Hold it!
Hold it!
I said hold it.
Jo, let's finish up this job.
I've changed my mind.
I've decided I want
the three million in cash.
Please! Just a little, please!
No. Drugs are expensive.
I can't give you any.
Don't say that.
I promise I'll work harder.
Shut up!
It hurts so bad.
Give me some quick, please!
You want it that much?
Here.
Give it to me.
Wait!
The dope!
Damn you!
You're inhuman!
If you want it, get your ass out there
and make me some money.
Don't be playing around
with your boyfriend.
Well?
Do you understand?
How did the job go?
Boss!
That was the first time
I've pulled that trick.
Here's the three million.
It was like Jo said.
There was a guy on the balcony.
From now on we're partners.
I won't work without him.
Jo, I checked you out.
You're clean.
You're now on the payroll.
Here's your front money.
I'm gonna hang out with you today.
Sorry. Not today.
I have a memorial service to attend.
An old friend of mine.
A memorial service?
Wow, thank you.
Oh, it's nothing.
Seeing these photos makes you feel
like Takeshita's still alive.
He used to love to sing
when he got drunk, didn't he?
Hello?
Excuse me.
Mrs. Takeshita?
My name is Mizuno.
My condolences.
Thank you.
A long time ago,
your husband was very kind to me.
Is that right?
Please, come inside.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.
Please stay and eat.
Thanks, but I must go.
Would you mind telling me
a story about my husband?
Hello. Takeshita speaking.
A yellow sweater?
I'm sorry, but we're all out
of yellow wool.
How about red?
TAKESHITA KNITTING SCHOOL
HOW ABOUT A DATE AT THE CLUB AOI?
Look at this.
You're sure she didn't work
at your club?
- Yes.
- Thanks.
Go out the back way.
A man's been following us.
DOUBLE SUICIDE
Come here.
I need to talk to you.
But I'm naked.
Me too.
I already took a shower.
That was careless,
rushing into the bathroom like that.
What if I were a killer?
I'm only joking. Come here.
What are you after?
- What do you mean?
- Don't play dumb.
What brings you here?
I just want
to get to know you, silly.
You're so strong.
I want you to kill a woman.
Find her and then kill her.
- Who?
First let's make love.
Tell me who.
You won't have much luck in marriage.
Three wives, it says.
I thought I'd marry you,
but I'd better not.
Cut the jokes.
It's no joke.
I'm here to talk to you.
Kill the boss's sixth mistress.
Just kill her.
Isn't this fun?
I'm gonna build a tomb for her.
You know the suicide case
involving the detective?
That girl was one of our call girls.
The paper said she was a clerk.
Yes, that was a cover.
Most of our girls have covers.
And?
The boss' sixth mistress runs the show.
Nobody's ever seen her,
and Nomoto keeps quiet about her.
But they can't fool me.
A woman's intuition, huh?
Find her.
Will you kill her?
First tell me why.
Is it jealousy? Money?
Everything.
She's the only one I can't control.
I see.
And what's in it for me?
Half of what I get.
And if I say no?
I'll say you dragged me here
and raped me.
He's insanely jealous,
so that'll be the end of you.
Not a bad deal.
But what happens
if I find her more attractive,
or if she pays me more?
LOVELY YOUNG LADIES
THE MURASAKI CLUB
No girls right now?
Tonight's fine, then.
Send one to the Hibiya at 8:00.
What's this? Why so upset?
Nothing.
Better safe than sorry.
What's on your mind?
Our boss wants to see you
to thank you.
Okay, but not right now.
What?
Not like this, anyway.
I don't like people
telling me what to do.
He's got a big mouth!
Gonna kill me here?
The cops are nearby,
and this area's full of apartments.
From this range, it'd be hard
not to blow your face off.
Go ahead.
The cops are nearby,
and this area's full of apartments.
That's my line, fool.
Now drop the gun.
Let's go.
- What?
You said your boss
wanted to see me, right?
Shut up!
So you don't care
if you've gotta close up shop?
Pay us a little more
and you'll be safe, Pachinko man.
I hear you're leaning towards
Nomoto Enterprises, right?
Answer me!
Watch it or they'll do you in.
Good work. Thanks.
So they finally brought you.
You got it wrong.
I came on my own.
Come on.
Don't be a sore loser.
Tell him.
He's got a gun.
A gun?
Give 'em the details.
It's a shotgun.
It can blow your face off.
Blow my face off?
Sounds like fun. Show me.
Hold it!
We don't want our guest hurt.
Show him out first.
Do it!
Come on!
Take it easy.
I don't know what Nomoto pays you,
but I'll double it.
Why do all you big shots
say the same stupid lines?
Fine. Everyone out.
We're gonna talk.
Out!
Now, how much?
- Gimme your gun.
- Don't! You'll put the boss in danger.
Shut up! I can't just stand by.
No, don't!
Watch this.
I'll get him in the back.
One million up front
and 200,000 a month.
I'll give you one and a half million,
and 300,000.
Join us.
No.
That's our top salary.
But I want Nomoto's, too.
You can't do that.
Nomoto is buying guns
to crush your mob.
What?
I'll spy on them for you.
Nomoto was originally
one of your men, right?
You should attack first
and wipe him out,
but don't let me pressure you.
- It's a deal.
- Thanks.
Hold it!
You overheard us?
I heard nothing,
and I'll never talk.
Leave him. He won't rat.
Besides, we're all partners now.
I'll let it go for today.
All right. Let's go.
- What?
You're my shield.
We're enemies on the outside.
I've got to stay on guard.
Don't!
I went to your apartment...
and saw you being taken away.
But I knew you'd come out on top.
I did, thanks to this.
I see.
The hammer's broken.
Those idiots would be
so pissed off if they knew.
Minami.
Do we run call girls?
Call girls?
This'll cost a fortune to fix.
Onodera kept asking
if we ran call girls. Do we?
Have some of this. It's great.
Don't you know anything?
All I'm interested in is guns.
Nothing else.
That's why they make fun of you.
Even Onodera knows
a woman runs the business.
A woman?
Alcohol and women are bad for me.
You're like that broken shotgun.
A useless piece of crap!
Go to sleep!
As useless as a broken shotgun?
How dare you call me an idiot!
You're the idiot!
He wasn't talking about a woman.
He meant Hideo.
The boss's brother. He's gay.
The one you met at his house.
Don't forget
I know everything about our gang!
I'm sorry.
Tell me about Hideo.
Sure.
His mother was a whore after the war.
Specialized in black men.
But never mention that to him.
A drunk woman once called him
"a son of a whore."
He carved her face up with a razor.
I saw it.
Her face looked
like a venetian blind.
Venetian blind?
Hideo with the razor blade.
Murasaki Club here.
Send me one.
- And your name?
- Yoshida.
Where are you?
In Shibuya.
Call us back in 30 minutes
from the pay phone at Namikibashi
to discuss the place, okay?
Do you have a car?
Please arrange it for me.
Keep this quiet.
Looks like there's nothing
wrong with him.
Yeah, he looks like he can pay.
Get me 416-1920, please.
Hello? It's me.
Do we have a girl for 3:00 p.m.?
Send her to Shibuya Public Hall.
Thanks.
Are you Hideo with the razor blade?
You know who I am, don't you?
- No.
- Really?
Who were you calling?
Where did you call?
None of your business.
You're going to take me there.
Where?
The place you just called.
I already know.
Hello? Put me through
to the same number as before.
Just do it!
Hello. Nomoto Enterprises?
What's your number?
416-1920. Nomoto?
I've got some business to see to.
I heard your mother was a whore.
Don't make me carve up your face.
Don't!
Tell me who your partner is.
I don't know.
You wanna look
like a venetian blind too?
Stop! I'll talk.
Who is it?
What're you doing?
Talk. Why did you do it?
Start talking, or more than
your face will look different!
I'll never talk, no matter what.
Who sent you?
Talk.
Stop it!
Stop it!
I'm sorry.
I'll never do it again.
Forgive me.
You fool!
If you don't suspect me,
just let me go.
Just shut up and watch!
Go on! Get out!
Stop it!
Hey, don't.
What's that?
He always gets like that
beating up women. It excites him.
He's a sadist.
There's a deal.
Be at the house by 2:00.
A deal?
- Drugs.
- Where?
Just be there at 2:00.
Hello? What?
The boss isn't here!
What?
Good morning. It's for you.
Now talk.
I told you to come alone.
I'm carrying money.
I need protection.
All right.
Nomoto's got a drug deal
planned for ten million.
Really?
Where?
Wait till the deal is done.
Then strike and take the money.
Just the money.
Forget Nomoto's drugs.
Why's that?
They'll think Nomoto did it.
They'll never sell to him again.
Drugs are the backbone of the mob.
Without them 
I see. And Nomoto's finished.
Thanks.
But why would you tell us this?
You got a grudge against them?
No, I just want the money.
On this one,
I'll take four of the ten million.
With two million in advance.
Two million?
Make it snappy.
Where's it happening?
Otherwise we forget the whole thing.
Hey!
Two million.
Two million's cheap
for a chance to finish off Nomoto.
I should be at Nomoto's at 2:00?
Yeah, just follow behind me in the car.
One blast of the horn
means it's the Nomoto car.
Two means the other car
has the money.
Laying low these days, Takechi?
Hello, Officer.
Mizuno!
Why did you attend
Takeshita's memorial service?
It's like you were insulting him.
Have you joined up
with Nomoto now?
I hear you have.
Takeshita didn't talk much about you,
but he took what you did pretty hard.
He'd be even more shocked at this.
Don't give me that sentimental crap.
You've changed
since you went to Kobe.
Embezzlement? It's a setup.
No, I looked into it.
You did it, just as the letter says.
No, I just borrowed the money
for investigation.
Why didn't you clear it first?
I had no proof.
It was a hunch.
The boss wouldn't have understood.
Please understand.
I know the Sakura mob
wrote that letter.
I wonder how they knew.
Anyway, this shows they've panicked.
Can you keep quiet about this for me?
You sure about this?
Well?
I'd stake my life on it.
Okay.
I'll forget about this letter.
I don't care what happens to it.
Thanks.
Just don't go too far,
or you risk your life.
Thanks. I'm grateful.
That night I tortured
one of the Sakura mob.
I went so far
that he couldn't talk anymore.
That was all.
I was arrested
for assault and embezzlement
and went to prison.
I was framed by the mob.
Takeshita almost lost his job.
That Takeshita.
In spite of the trouble I caused him...
he took care of my wife
while I was in jail.
She had TB,
and he got her into the hospital
and even sent her money
every month
on his pittance of a salary.
But in the end, she died.
He was quite a guy.
Mizuno.
I had no chance to pay him back.
When he was killed, I figured
this was my chance to repay him.
So I'm after his murderer.
- That was a suicide.
You think Takeshita
would cheat on his wife?
He was so awkward with women.
There's proof.
What proof?
It was a trap.
He was framed like me, and murdered.
You think the murderer is with Nomoto?
You know Yosuke Ishiyama?
You do, right?
This is him in Kobe. Look familiar?
A drug tycoon.
When he moved to Tokyo,
Takeshita was transferred here too.
Ishiyama is real smart.
Takeshita searched for proof.
I met a guy in prison
who Takeshita once arrested.
A Nomoto mobster.
He'll be here soon.
Got an appointment or something?
I'm gonna get Takeshita's killer.
Idiot! That's not your job.
Leave that to the cops.
We'll look into it.
No way.
An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.
I'll kill the killers.
But 
Stop right here.
Don't stop. Take us to police HQ.
Stop!
Stop!
Don't worry. I'll be in touch.
Take him home.
I'm arresting you
for illegal possession of a firearm.
Gonna use handcuffs?
Don't be an idiot!
Don't take it out on the car, you jerk!
Damn it! He tricked us!
Who told you about this?
I'm too ashamed to say.
He looks like he's in a hurry.
He mustn't see us.
Hide, you idiot!
What is it?
I think I've seen him
somewhere before.
Seen who?
I must've been imagining it.
Long time no see.
How about some mah-jongg tonight?
- Sounds great.
Business first.
Perfect.
The deal is done.
We're changing cars.
Sorry.
I think I know you.
Or do I?
- What's up?
- Nothing.
I think we've met before.
I can't remember everyone I meet.
One blast of the horn.
Get the Nomoto car.
Give us the money.
Hand it over!
We'll get you for this.
Shut up!
Hurry up!
We have just one thing
to say to you:
You pay us again.
Mr. Ishiyama, you've got it wrong.
I swear we didn't do it.
The only ones who knew
the details were you and us.
But 
If you don't pay again, then fine.
That'll be the end of our dealings.
Wait a minute.
Please don't jump to conclusions.
Boss.
What is it, Shibata?
That guy driving the car!
He's a cop!
I'm sure I saw him in Kobe!
Who was it?
It was Jo.
That's four million for me.
Not a bad deal.
Let's do business again sometime.
I'd be happy too,
but are you sure it's okay?
Not all of Nomoto's men are fools.
I know.
Just to join me for lunch.
That's all.
Have her wait at the Hibiya.
A red flower on her handbag?
Got it.
Here it is.
You wanted me to see these people?
No, I'll send them away.
He tells me to work and work,
but look at the guy he sends me to!
Go tell Hideo
he should be more selective!
Anything else?
Tell him he's an idiot too!
Minami, let's get it over with.
I can't shoot Jo!
Where's the loot?
What loot?
The money your men took
from Mr. Shibata.
What are you talking about?
You're with the Kobe police.
I met you three years ago.
Look!
You idiot!
Why didn't you just ask me
if you wanted to know about that?
That picture means nothing.
So you're a cop, huh?
I was.
Listen. Three years ago,
I was arrested
for assault and embezzlement.
Don't forget I did time too!
Check it out.
It was in the police gazette
three years ago.
Damn!
You cut my finger for that!
Get someone to check it out!
"Detective Mizuno arrested
for assault and embezzlement."
I'll get you back for this, boss!
You idiot!
Don't talk to him like that!
Hold it.
You have reason to be angry.
I'm sorry.
Let's settle this.
How much do you want
for your finger?
Let me have one of yours.
Can you prove it wasn't you?
Now you ask?
Any ideas who it was?
I saw a Sanko guy there.
The Sanko mob?
Yeah, by the bridge.
I'm sure he's involved.
I bet he sent the signal.
You sure you're not mistaken?
Don't ask if you won't listen.
Why don't you get the guy?
What's his name?
Just some punk.
But I remember his face.
Bye.
So it was you and your buddies, huh?
- I don't know who 
- Bullshit!
Talk! It was you guys, wasn't it?
Minami, throw this bum in the river!
Okay.
All right! We did it.
Now you tell us.
So, they did do it.
One last question.
I'll just ask you once:
Did you set it up?
No!
I did as Takechi told me!
Takechi?
How did he know?
I don't know.
Don't give me this bullshit!
Whatever you might think,
I'm a Sanko man!
I never lie!
You'll be dishonored
if you drown me in the river.
Kill me with a gun.
Shoot me straight in the heart.
Lock him in the basement.
Boss, this looks like a challenge
from the Sanko mob.
Damn them!
Onodera plotted all this.
We'll go on the offensive, damn it!
Hold it.
We can get them anytime.
First we find out from Takechi
who the informant was.
It's my honor on the line.
Let me handle this.
416-1920.
You guys work with Jo.
No, let me do this.
Come on, Jo.
Who is it?
Sorry to bother you.
Is Takechi in?
He's not back yet.
Tell us the truth.
When's he expected back?
She's beautiful.
Don't get any funny ideas, Minami.
All we've got to do is wait.
You, outside.
Thirty-minute shifts.
Minami, your shift.
It's your turn.
I wanna stay with her.
For you, I'm drinking
for the first time in my life.
What if he puts up a fight?
Our orders are not to kill him.
"Run. Nomoto's trap. Jo."
That's enough.
What if Nomoto finds out?
You don't have to tell him.
I've fallen for her.
Don't look at me like that.
We just have to get Takechi, right?
Jo, change places.
No. Why should Minami
have all the fun?
I don't like it.
If you want to keep
a lookout, go ahead.
I never thought
you'd fall for a woman.
I thought touching a statue's ass
was all you could handle.
The key!
By the door.
Your husband's gonna die anyway.
Let him have some fun with you.
You all right, Minami?
Ishizaki and Takechi
shot each other. Got that?
Leave me here.
I wanna be with her.
It's a murder!
Stop!
Jo.
You can't make it with me.
Leave me here.
Don't be stupid.
You go. I'll stay here.
I don't want the police
to get hold of you.
Stay here. I'll take a look.
She was so nice.
TAKESHITA KNITTING SCHOOL
You?
I'm sorry, but he's wounded.
May we come in?
Doesn't he need a doctor?
No, I'll see to him.
I'll take the slug out myself.
Mrs. Takeshita,
your deceased husband and I
were detectives together.
But I got fired
over a certain incident.
I didn't believe the story
about what happened to him.
I checked it out myself.
I found out he didn't kill himself.
He was murdered.
- Really?
- It's true.
You know he couldn't
have done it, don't you?
Not with a call girl.
She worked for Nomoto.
The note was a fake.
She didn't know she'd be killed too.
Who did it?
I don't know yet.
Someone in Nomoto's mob.
I joined them to find out.
I'm getting close.
If the cops come in now,
I'll never find out.
Will you help me?
Just look the other way for a while.
I understand.
Thanks. I'll get started now.
Nomoto here.
Jo? What's up?
Takechi surprised us.
Sanko knows what we're up to.
Just think if they find out
about Takechi getting hit.
They're probably already
planning revenge.
Where are you?
Right now?
The Takeshita Knitting School.
Please send help as soon as possible.
Hurry, or Minami will die.
Oh, it's you. What's up?
What? Takechi's dead?
Nomoto did it? Damn him!
They're preparing to attack.
I'll bet they're the ones
who started this.
Be careful.

as the saying goes.
You can count on me.
Mrs. Takeshita,
will you do us another favor?
Someone's coming for him.
Will you go with them?
No!
You've seen his face.
If they see you alive,
Nomoto will suspect me.
Don't worry.
Trust me. I'll protect you.
Thanks for coming. I didn't expect
you'd come in person, boss.
How's Minami?
Still unconscious.
Better take this woman with you.
She'll just get in the way of our attack.
- Then you're going to 
- I won't kill her.
I'll leave Hideo to watch her.
Nothing to worry about.
Boss!
Okay? Keep a good eye on her.
Something's fishy about Sanko.
They may be getting ready to attack.
Inui will keep us informed.
Are you all right, sir?
You ran right into this 
Look!
You bastard!
We caught a Nomoto punk!
Don't bother about him.
The more they think
we're making a big deal of this...
the more of them we can lure in.
We'll get 'em
all together in one place
and then let them have this.
Kaboom!
That'll be the end of them.
Let's go!
If we're successful,
you can have their turf.
Thanks. We'll be on our way.
Jo, come here for a sec.
You're not going.
With Minami and Ishizaki dead,
I'll be needed.
You'd only watch anyway, right?
Freeze!
What is it this time?
Thanks a lot
for all your lies.
What's that?
Don't play dumb!
We know everything.
We know you joined us
to avenge your pal.
And you're in with Sanko
on their plan to wipe us out!
Who told you that crap?
Don't play dumb.
Who was it?
Damn! We're too late!
They're coming!
The more, the better!
This is our chance, guys!
Wait!
Leave it to me.
I'll go first, and then you follow.
Good. If you do it,
you can have their turf.
Come with me if you want to!
Don't let them die in vain. Go!
Go! Next!
Attack!
Crush him and you get all his turf!
Go! Will nobody go?
Damn that Nomoto!
Damn that Nomoto!
Now talk!
Did you kill Detective Takeshita?
- No.
Talk or I'll blow those fingers off!
- No!
- Then who was it?
I don't know.
I'll ask again.
Who killed him and why?
Really, I don't know!
- Talk!
- I don't know!
Would you tell if you were me?
What's Takeshita's wife to you?
You wanna lose them all?
- Don't you know?
She's my sixth mistress.
You promised not to shoot!
A promise to you is nothing.
I want to kill you,
but I've promised to keep you alive.
So it's just three fingers today!
One day you'll lose all your limbs!
Remember that!
You shouldn't let someone live
who has a grudge against you.
You've got a lot to learn.
A wrong number?
They thought this was a clinic.
Are you hungry?
Your brother is missing
three fingers now.
Wanna lose your nose?
Who killed Takeshita?
Say it again.
Who killed Takeshita? Say the name!
You killed Takeshita, didn't you?
No! How could I?
He knew your secret.
That's crazy! Can you prove it?
Nomoto sang like a bird!
I shot off three of his fingers.
No mercy for you either.
You admit it?
Nomoto did it. I had to help.
He threatened me.
Was Nomoto there?
Yes.
The motive?
He found out about our call girl ring.
What were you to Nomoto?
His lover.
Why'd you marry Takeshita?
Nomoto ordered me to.
He wanted me to spy on the police.
How did you snare him?
He fell for me.
I was his first love.
How did you kill him?
Chloroform
and an overdose of sleeping pills.
Then we took him to the hotel.
- What about the woman?
- Nomoto killed her.
Are you sure?
I didn't want to kill him.
I had to! He made me do it!
He's a sadist.
Killing means nothing to him.
If I refused,
he would have killed me too!
Don't look at me like that!
It's been hell for me, too.
I looked for a way
to escape from Nomoto.
But I couldn't.
I'm sorry I killed him.
I really did love him.
It's not a lie.
At first, the marriage was
only part of a clever plan.
But then I truly fell in love.
I wanted us both
to get away from Nomoto.
Honestly, I did.
I thought if I told him
all about the call girls and drugs,
he'd put a stop to it all.
I would have done it,
if we weren't up against Nomoto.
But it would never work.
He'd never spare an informer,
even to the ends of the earth.
There's no way to save yourself.
I loved Takeshita,
but I was terrified of Nomoto.
Is that unforgivable?
He threatened me!
I was a victim too!
Mr. Mizuno, please!
I have a feeling you'll help me.
You were a victim.
I know he was a sadist.
I wonder what kind of childhood
he and his brother had.
Their mother was 
Yes, she was a street whore.
Even at 40 years old.
Put me through
to Detective Hirokawa.
Hirokawa?
Yeah, it's finally all over.
Mizuno, where are you?
Hello? Hello?
What's wrong, Mizuno?
Who killed Takeshita?
Say the name!
Kumiko Takeshita.
How do you know that?
She called me.
My brother and I moced the body.
Was Nomoto there during the act?
No.
All he did was help moce the body?
Yes.
He didn't like the fact
she'd married Takeshita.
She came up with the plan
all by herself.
And the girl who was killed?
Kumiko killed her too.
And the phone number
416-1920?
An unlisted number.
THE END
