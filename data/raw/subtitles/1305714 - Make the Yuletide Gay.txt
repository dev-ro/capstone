[Voiceover] Hallelujah
I'm done for the semester.
[Voiceover] Thank you Mr. Gunnunderson.
You're quite welcome
Professor Vandaveer.
Please, semesters over, call me Daniel.
Okay, Daniel,
everybody calls me Gun.
I've heard, the big Gun.
Happy holidays, professor.
Were you in this class too?
Yes, sir.
Anyway, have a great holiday,
hope to see more of
you next semester, Gun.
Okay.
[Gun] I can't believe we're like
the last people on campus.
When are heading homo for the holidays?
I've got to get home
before sunset or mom freaks.
You know, I never understood that,
what happens if you don't
get home before sunset.
Do Hanukkah zombies come out and get you?
Actually it's the opposite,
we turn into vampires.
So I have to stay inside
for your protection.
Thanks, well don't worry about me,
I'm a pig so I'll be safe.
(laughing)
Safe from what?
Hanukkah vampires.
I don't even want to know.
Are you guys going to
spend break together?
Sadly no, my parents
sent me a plane ticket.
Nathan, dear, we have lots of work
for you to do on the
estate over the holidays.
That's offensive.
What about you, Gun?
Well I'm heading back to our dorm room
and then I'm driving home as
soon as I get myself packed.
Oh, well, enjoy getting packed.
Oh, we will.
Happy Hanukkah, tramp.
Merry Christmas, whores.
I'll see you next year.
[Voiceover] Alone at last.
Nathan, I really need to hit the road.
Don't I get to hit you first?
15 minutes, that's it.
I can work with that.
(phone ringing)
Sorry.
Hey, dad.
Well, that's a fine how do you do.
It's your mother, don't ya know.
Oh I'm sorry, hi ma.
Hi baby boy, how was
your big test thingy.
My philosophy final
exam thingy was fine.
Oh goody, on your way home?
In a few minutes.
Oh, well hurry, traffic is freaking
terrible during the holidays.
I'm heading out the door as we speak.
Good, I can use all
the help that I can get.
I am determined to find the best Christmas
cookie recipe ever and
finally show up that
uppity Heather Mancuso next door.
Well, ma, if anybody can do it, you can.
Merry Christmas, Mrs. Gunnunderson.
[Gun's Mother] Is that
you little roommate?
Tell him Merry Christmas from us.
Wait, do his people celebrate Christmas?
Uh, yes, they do.
She says, Happy Kwanzaa.
Ah, what are his plans for the holidays?
He's going to visit his parents.
Ah, that's so nice.
Christmas is so darn important,
you have to have family.
(timer chimes)
Oh, Christ on a cracker, my oatmeal
yums yums are burning, you
better scoot, young man, kisses.
[Gun] Love you.
Nathan, I really have to go,
it is not wise to upset Anya
Gunnunderson at Christmas.
I really wish we could
spend the holidays together.
Me too, babe.
Okay, one last thing.
What?
Nathan, we already exchanged gifts.
I know, I know, but I saw this
in the window and I had to get it.
Do you like it?
I love it.
This is by far the gayest thing I own.
Really, but what about that thing
in your nightstand drawer?
Okay, it's the second gayest thing.
I love it.
Good, now.
Another one?
No, no, no, now hand it to me.
- What?
- [Nathan] Just do it.
Okay.
Gun, for me, you shouldn't have.
It's so pretty, thank you.
What, I couldn't resist
buying something for myself.
♫ Coffee in the am
♫ Hands on the wheel
♫ Time on my side
♫ With the wind at my heels
♫ Blurred yellow lines
♫ It leads straight away
♫ And all of the signs point to a holiday.
♫ This time of year
♫ It's time to make
♫ Make my way to you
♫ Time for a break ♫
I have such great taste.
(phone ringing)
Hi, dad.
Hello, son.
How are you, sir?
Fine, fine.
So everything's on schedule
for my flight home tomorrow?
Right, yes, about that, I was gonna.
Is that Nathan?
Yes.
Is that mom?
Yes.
Did you tell him?
I haven't had the chance to tell him.
Tell me what?
Oh, give me that phone, really.
Hello, Nathan, it's mother.
Yeah, I got that, tell me what.
There's been a
wonderful change of plans.
Is that really necessary, darling?
More than you know, darling.
Mother,
I'm sorry sweetheart, As I was saying,
there's been a wonderful change of plans,
somehow we just forgot to tell you.
Then tell me now.
Well, you know the music society
has it's annual fundraiser,
you know, simply everyone is there.
And?
And the items this year
in the silent auction
were so wonderful that
we simply had to bid
on all of them, and guess what,
You won something?
We won something.
What did you win?
A cruise.
A cruise.
A Christmas cruise.
How cool!
For two.
For two.
Your father and I leave tonight,
we'll be gone for three weeks,
seeing all the sites of the Holy Land,
and I'll be able to buy
all sorts of trinkets.
Just the two of you.
There simply weren't any
extra cabins available.
Mom, what am I supposed to do now?
Your Christmas check is under the tree
and dinner is still on order at Neimans.
Yeah, that sounds like fun.
Oh, and your father and I have left
a list of things for you
to handle while we're away.
Wait, wasn't this fundraiser
like three weeks ago?
Something like that,
Merry Christmas dear.
Merry Christmas?
(groaning)
What am I supposed to do now?
(dramatic music)
(festive music)
There you are, you're home.
Mom, mom, mom.
Oh, don't you give me any of that,
I'm 22 years old and about to
graduate from college crap,
you'll always be my baby boy.
I know, I missed you.
Good, now why don't you
come on inside, why don't ya.
Alright.
[Gun's Mother] Geez, would it have hurt
ya to wear a little color sometime.
Well, very restrained,
you guys didn't go all out this year.
Oh, your father thought it was
getting to be a bit much, so we
are trying something small this year.
Yeah, well, when I didn't see the
inflatable sleigh on the roof,
I knew something was going on.
Oh, that's cause of the
gosh darn insurance premiums.
Oh, Sven, get your keester
in here, Olaf's home.
Olaf, is that you?
Yeah, it's me dad.
Well, come here once why don't ya?
I'd say it's good to see you
but I can't see anything
without my glasses.
They're on top of your head dad.
Oh, oh geez,
oh cripes, you look older
every time I see you.
Oh, well, technically I am
older every time you see me.
True, true and on a
purely biological level
well, and on a emotional and
or spiritual level as well.
Of course, a person changes all the time.
Like a.
Like a.
Well I do enjoy these chats dad.
Oh yeah, right, now
where'd I put my glasses?
Are you sure I can't
get you anything else?
I am full.
You definitely can not get brats
like this in the cafeteria.
Ah.
I don't know why you don't
move out of the dorm already.
Get yourself a nice
little apartment somewhere
big enough for you and a special someone.
You're never gonna meet a nice girl
living in a all male dorm.
You're gonna end up like old
Clay Handleman down the road.
Never married, having to keep a roommate
like that nice hairdresser
that lives with him.
He does such a great
job with the highlights.
I like living in the dorms.
Oh for crying outside,
leave the boy be, Anya.
He'll come out of shell
when he's good and ready.
And then, oh geez, the girls will
come running like salmon.
(laughing)
I'm pretty sure salmon swim, dad.
Exactly, besides the dorms are
good for male bonding.
Oh yeah, absolutley, lots of bonding.
Tons of bonding.
Day and night, sometimes
two or three times a night.
Oh!
I told you this 100 times mama,
it's like when I'm with the dean
and the other professors, I tell ya what,
I've made more connections in the
locker room sauna then in all
the academic conferences together.
(coughing)
- It's like when.
- [Gun's Mother] Honey.
I'm fine.
Wait a minute, what was I doing,
I was with oh what's his name,
I was.
Oh, there were so many
pretty girls on campus
that time we visited,
oh, oh, I so like that
real feisty one with
the real short hair do.
What is she doing now?
Um, I'm pretty sure she's running
a bed and breakfast in Palm Springs
with her, her good friend, Ellen.
Oh, isn't that super.
Huh,
Listen, there's something
I want to tell you guys.
It's about me and um, and college.
It's about me at college.
Okay, you see,
(doorbell rings)
Oh, who the dickens could that be?
Didn't you invite.
Oh, hush, Sven.
Olaf get the door like a good boy.
[Olaf] Hey.
Hi Olaf.
[Olaf] Abby, what are you doing here?
Well, your mom said
you'd be home tonight
and I thought, I'll bet he'd like
to eat a nice warm muffin.
You always did like my
muffins, didn't you?
No, I can honestly tell you
I haven't had another one since
we went out in high school.
Oh, Sven, look who it is.
Abby Mancuso from next
door, what a coinkidink.
But you said 8 o'clock.
Oh, never mind that, come on in.
Sit down, for pete's sake.
(laughing)
[Gun's Father] Why does
this crossword puzzle
have only nine letter words?
That's Sudoku dear.
Sudoko?
Yeah.
Sudoko,
should I know what that means?
So I'm pretty sure I totally
aced my Philosophy final exam.
All we had to do was fill out
this entire blue book
answering one question.
What was the question?
Why?
Just curious.
That was the question, why?
I don't get it.
Shouldn't the answer be, why not?
(laughing)
How did you answer the question?
Well, my argument was that in.
America's inherently meaningless
political environment, which when
combined with the advent of reality
tv, which has forced the masses to
look outward rather than inward,
why is the only possible
question worth asking.
Especially if we ever hope to further
humankinds ideological growth or prevent
the stagnation that is currently
bogged down not only the arts and culture
of our country, but also the charitable
outreach for those who are less fortunate
especially those who come
from less developed countries.
For whom the question of why will
never be important because they're
entire lives almost exclusively
focus on the question of how.
Oh, well I do love my
American Idol, though.
And there you have it.
Gotta a question for you Mr. Fancypants.
Why don't you offer Abby
a little more cocoa?
More cocoa would be lovely, thank you.
I need a nine letter
word ending in four.
So then I had to hear all about
her beauty school classes.
Apparently, the eloquent up-do is
the hardest look to master.
Well, duh, remember Nicole
Kidman at last year's Oscars?
Uh, that was tragic.
For real, right?
So, you excited about
seeing your parents tomorrow?
Strangely, I'd rather be
seeing your parents tomorrow.
Well, I'm sure they'd love that but
we both know it's not going to happen.
Your stupid parents would not allow it.
Hey, they're still my parents.
So, they deserve to be called
stupid for the way they treat you.
You have no idea.
So where are you?
Just on my way to the restroom.
Talk to you tomorrow?
Definitely.
Morning, sweetie.
Have you seen my glasses?
Oh, pardon me, I see everything of ya.
Oh, sorry mama.
Remember Olaf's home, you can't
go running around with your
all together out like that.
I thought you liked it when I do that.
(squealing)
Watch yourself Mr. Gunnunderson.
I'd rather watch you Mrs. Gunnunderson
(giggling)
Sit down and eat your apple skever.
Good morning.
Now that's how a grown
man dresses for breakfast.
How late did Abby stay last night?
Too late, why did you
guys invite her over?
Well, I thought you'd enjoy chatting
with an old friend like that.
She's so sweet, plus you
were practically engaged.
We were not, we dated four years ago.
Four years, in high school.
We're totally different people now.
I mean, she's a beautician, and I'm.
You're what?
I'm not a beautician.
You're telling me,
with that hair of yours,
have Abby give you a cut and blow,
you'll be happier for it.
I don't need Abby to
blow me to be happy.
Oh my God these are good, I
could eat a million of them.
Wait a second.
Dad, seriously, it's
not even 9 o'clock yet.
If the dead taught me anything,
it's that it's always 420 somewhere.
Jeppers, Sven, it's Christmas.
Which is why I brought
out the good stuff.
You want some?
Sven!
Oh mama please, the boys over 21 now,
I got some new plants in the basement.
I'm good, really.
(doorbell rings)
I'll get it.
(door creaks)
Mr. Gunnunderson.
Yes.
Hi, I mean, Hi, I'm Nathan.
Nathan Stanford, I'm your sons.
He's my roommate.
Hey it's my roommate.
Wow,
who is supposed to be across
the country with his parents right now.
Well, change of plans, and I thought
hey, I'd surprise you, surprise?
Yeah.
What are you wearing?
Woah, hey buddy, dude,
it is good to see you.
What a surprise!
Uh, dad, do you mind, you know,
closing up a bit.
Oh, sorry.
Just not right.
Wow, now I see the family resemblance.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.
Dude, your dad is hot.
Okay, why, my dad, really?
Oh yeah,
What are you doing here?
I told you change of plans.
Apparently, mommy and daddy had
better things to do than spend
Christmas with their only son, so,
I'm sorry, babe.
Yeah, whatever.
Okay, seriously, what
are those, what is that?
- [Gun] What?
- Are those pleats or?
Oh come on, my mom
bought me these pants.
Okay, let's pretend that she's Stacy
and I'm Clinton, naturally, and this here,
this is what not to wear.
What?
What?
Why aren't you happy to see me?
I am, it's just,
It's just what?
What are you two boys talking about?
Nothing.
Well, then let's get your friend
settled before your balls get cold.
Pancake balls.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Nathan.
It's so nice to meet Olaf's friends.
Why his girlfriend Abby
was just here last night,
do you know her?
Girlfriend?
She's not my girlfriend.
She was once, maybe again someday.
Oh my God, you're not out.
Of pancake balls, are you mom?
Oh of course not, sweetheart.
I'll find you a picture of Olaf's
junior prom with Abby, so adorable.
Now let me show you where
you can sleep tonight.
Okay, okay, Gun,
I love your hair.
Supercuts?
Yeah,
(giggling)
Here we go, Nathan dear, I hope
you don't mind being on bottom.
Um excuse me?
The bunk beds.
Oh,
I remember when Sven and I got
these beds for little Olaf,
he scampered right up that ladder,
jumped up and down screaming,
I want to be on top, I want to be on top.
It was so cute.
(giggling)
So you don't mind do you?
Um, actually, Mrs. Gunnunderson
in our dorm room, you know
I'd much rather be on top.
Oh,
In the bunk beds that is.
Must have got a jump on you
when you first moved in, eh?
Yes, yes he did.
[Gun's Mother] Oh (giggling)
But you know what, it's Christmas,
so for you Mrs. Gunnunderson,
I'll let your son be on top.
Oh, you are precious.
Alrighty then, you boys get settled in
and you, you call me Anya.
Anya, thank you.
[Gun's Mother] (giggling) Too cute!
Okay, okay, am I missing something here?
What is up with the street warrior teen?
How are you, Mr. Big Queer Man on Campus
not out to your parents?
I don't know, it was just,
the timing was never right
and look, I was going
to tell them yesterday,
but then Abby showed up,
And they haven't figured it out?
I mean, they have met you, right?
Look, I can straighten
up when I need to, okay?
Yeah, by why do you need to,
your parents seem like totally cool.
Yeah, that's what a lot of people think
before they actually come out.
You know Josh right?
Josh who?
Geology class Josh or
student council Josh?
Student council Josh.
Hmm, no I don't know him.
Okay, anyway, his parents,
they are in the entertainment
industry, right?
They work with gays all the time.
He thought if anybody would be
supportive and understanding, they would.
And they weren't?
They cut him off completely.
No explanation.
Lucky for him, he had a
point foundation scholarship.
Otherwise, he would have had to drop out.
Sucks.
Yeah
I guess I should be happy
my parents still talk to me.
Barely, but still.
Working on the LGBT student council,
I have met kids whose red state,
religious parents welcome
them with open arms.
And kids whose liberal parents
cut them off completely.
They stop speaking to
them, or worse, much worse.
Cher
I am sharing.
No diva Cher,
she didn't know what to do when Chastity
came out and come on she's Cher.
Exactly.
I just, I couldn't take it.
I just couldn't take it
if they stopped loving me.
Babe,
No, no, no.
Look I honestly don't
think that's going to happen.
But if it helps, I love you,
even if you are big ole homo.
Yeah, it helps.
And?
And
thanks.
And, what else do you
say when I say I love you?
What, I said thank you,
shouldn't that be enough?
You are going to get it tonight.
Oh no, no, no, you
heard what my mom said.
Apparently, you're
going to get it tonight.
Promises, promises.
(laughing) stop, let me go.
Oh for crying in the sink,
hey stop your rough housing right now,
you're going to get grass
stains on those shirts
and I'm plum out of Shout.
Yes ma'am.
Now get your butts back
inside and have some breakfast.
Wrestling at their age,
what a couple of goofballs.
See what I mean, totally oblivious.
Yep.
Wait, why did I come in here?
I have to say,
you both seem way to young
to have a son Gun's age.
We were high school
sweethearts, don't ya know.
Really?
May the Packers never win
another Super Bowl if I'm lying.
That's football, right?
(laughing)
You're a stitch.
Yeah, high school sweet hearts we were.
Even though, he moved to
town from over in Minnesota.
Oh, so then where are you from?
Well, Wisconsin, don't ya know?
What's the difference?
Ut oh
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
So we got married right after graduation
and went off to college together
and had little Olaf right away.
So wait, you got married in the summer
but you're birthday isn't until December,
is that nine months apart?
My water broke right darn in
the middle of my geology final.
But you stayed and finished the test.
Got an A too.
I had my little boy right
in the campus infirmary.
No thanks to you.
Oh give me a break, I'd
just finished my own finals.
I was a little incapacitated that day.
Incapacitated my foot, high
as a kite is more like it.
Yeah, he comes into the room,
wanting to name the boy,
Jerry Garcia Gunnunderson.
I mean how silly is that?
Yeah, well Olaf is so much better.
Yeah, I know.
But when you father didn't get his way.
Oh, mama,
He takes all his clothes off
and starts meditating in
the middle of the room.
My clothes told me I
needed to talk to God,
what else could I do?
Well, what did God say?
He told me the secret of life.
Which I then whispered into little.
Olaf's ear for him to know.
What was it?
Hey, I was a bady, how
am I supposed to know.
Don't look at me I was high as a kite.
Who are all these for, anyway?
Well we needed something for
under this tree, it's so darn bare.
So all of these are just for decoration.
Uh yep.
Yeah, I'm not getting
paid enough for this.
Your dad is a trip.
Yeah, I think a
flashback is more like it.
Alone at last.
I think it might be time for bed.
You sure?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
Didn't you have to sleep in
your childhood pajamas while you're home?
Well, um, only if you want me too.
You know, you could be the hot
naughty boarding school boy.
Yeah, okay.
And then you could be the uh.
What the stern headmaster
coming to punish me.
Oh, bad boy - [Gun] Oh yeah.
Very bad boy.
Okay, okay.
I think somebody needs a spanking.
Me.
Oh don't mind me, I
finished your laundry.
Just in time by the look of it.
Mom I haven't even been
home for 24 hours yet
how did you have time to do my laundry.
Oh, mother, has her ways.
Oh, are those the cutest things ever.
Thanks.
So colorful.
Are those little monkeys?
[Nathan] Monkeys, yep,
they're hungry little monkeys.
Oh so cute, so cute.
Alright, you boys get some sleep.
Nighty night.
Well, guess that kind of,
um, ruined the mood, huh?
Oh yeah, big time.
Yeah.
Well, goodnight.
Yeah, night.
Grades good this semester?
Very.
That's good.
Got that obligatory parenting
question out of the way.
Alright, come on let's go.
[Gun] So how are your
students this year?
[Gun's Father] Oh,
stupid as all get out,
I weep for the future.
Except for you, of course.
[Gun] Of course.
So Nathan's pretty smart too, you know.
I don't know, I guess you
rubbed off on him pretty good.
Man, are you okay?
Yeah, just a klutz today.
So what do you think about Nathan?
Oh, I guess he seems nice enough
for that type.
What type?
Oh, you know, that type,
that over-privileged East coast type.
Oh, that type.
So you don't like him then?
- Who?
- [Gun] Nathan.
Oh,
well,
if you like him, I like him.
Well, I do, you know, like him,
I wanted to tell you guys about that.
Well, that's good, I
hated my first roommate.
Did I ever tell you about him?
Many times.
Oh, he used to borrow my stuff
without asking me, even my underwear.
Gross.
That's when I stopped
wearing them all together.
Morning.
Oh, Nathan dear, you're just in time,
I'm getting my beaver ready for Christmas.
Excuse me?
Oh, that, that is one magnificent
beaver, Mrs. Gunnunderson.
Yeah, well, Sven
loves it, don't ya know.
Didn't want to go running with the boys?
Ah, I'm not so much with the exercise.
Ah, that's fine at your age,
but the older you get, the harder
it is to stay thin, oy.
Sven doesn't seem to have any trouble.
Oh good golly, he's got to work
at it, don't ya know.
He gets the munchies.
Now you don't mind him
getting, you know, the munchies.
Of course I do, it's a nasty habit.
And he can't remember a
gosh darn thing these days.
He even fell asleep in the
middle of class one day.
Yeah, right in the middle of
a lecture, for pete's sake.
Can you top that?
I'd like too.
But you know what they say,
hate the sin, love the sinner.
They do say that.
Yeah, I'll get him to
change one of these days.
Feminine powers are strong that way.
You'll find out soon enough.
What do you mean?
Well, when you get married, silly.
You'll find yourself doing things
for your true love that
that you wouldn't think possible.
I can imagine.
Didn't Olaf tell me you're seeing
someone at that college of yours?
Um,
actually,
yeah, I am seeing someone right now.
I knew it, I could see it in your eyes.
What is she like?
Well, the person that I'm seeing is
beautiful, inside and out,
and is caring, and is just
really someone special.
Ah, why can't Olaf
find someone like that?
Maybe he has, and he
just hasn't told you yet.
Olaf tells me everything.
We have no secrets.
But have you ever asked him,
you know, about his love life?
Maybe there's something
he wants to tell you.
Oh don't be silly, I
know all I need to know.
And I'm certainly not the prying kind.
Now, where do your people come from
and what does your father do for a living?
After lunch we need to
get a little something
for the Wesanowskis, the
run the local nursery.
[Nathan] Ah, I could never do that.
You know, like all those
kids running around,
[Gun's Mother] It's
a plant nursery silly.
Sven, gets all his supplies there.
[Gun] Yep, my dad swears by their shit.
Language.
I meant their fertilizer.
So wait, you don't want any kids?
Why do you?
Maybe.
Really?
I don't know.
I mean I guess they're not so bad.
Yoohoo, Anya.
Oh cripes.
Hello Anya.
Heather, dear, surprised to see
you on your feet this time of day.
Oh just dropping off a package,
the stupid mailman delivered
to my place by mistake.
It's amazing how often he
delivers his package at your house.
I can't help it if I always need
a little something new to fill the
hole my dear husband left when he died.
Ah, still milking that
after five years, eh?
Abby, hurry up, Anya clearly needs
to get her hands on her box.
- Hello, Mrs. Gunnunderson,
- [Gun's Mother] Hi dear.
- It's so good to see you.
- [Gun's Mother] You too.
Hi again Olaf.
Hey Abby.
Hey anything else mom?
No.
If you kids don't mind, I need
to see a man about a cheese log.
Hi, I'm Abby.
Hi, hi I'm Nathan, Nathan Stanford,
how are you, what's up, yo.
Oh my God, you two are totally gay.
Bitch, why didn't you tell me?
Because I have told anybody here.
Yeah, I got that.
Did you just call me bitch?
Okay, and if you're gay what
is going on with your clothes?
I know, he thinks they're going
to keep him in the closet.
No, they should stay in the closet.
Right.
(laughing)
How did you tell?
Oh, well duh, look at you two together.
And you don't mind?
I only mind that I've been wasting
my time trying to get
your hot bod in the sack.
What just happened
to Ms. Prim and Proper?
Oh screw that, that's
mostly for your mom.
And plus, I thought that you liked that.
Ah no, prim and proper,
definitely not his thing.
I can tell you nasty little boy.
You're not going to
tell my parents, right?
Girl, please, hey you guys want
to come over for a vodka fizz later?
I've been dying to get my drunk on.
Ah, yes, count me in.
Absolutely, you know what, I think
I actually like you better this way.
Who knows, maybe I could
switch back for ya?
Honey, you weren't that
good in the first place.
Oh, I love you, see, she's got spunk.
Yeah, yeah, just not the kind I like.
Pineapple juice, trust me.
What are you kids chatting about?
Oh, I was just trying to get Gun
to join me at church this weekend.
(laughing)
Good luck with that, don't ya know.
Thank you.
Yeah, anytime, by the way, tell
you dad he was a little light on
the last delivery but I'll let it slide.
[Gun] I do miss this place.
[Nathan] I would too.
Did you ever have bunk
beds when you were a kid?
Oh no, my parents would
have never allowed that.
Didn't you ever have sleep
overs when you were younger?
Nope, they didn't allow that either.
Why not?
I think they saw that signs early.
Afraid if I had a friend sleep
over I might turn out gay.
Well it's a good thing
that didn't happen.
Yeah, totally.
You know what I just realized?
You never told me how you
came out to your parents.
Oh, I don't think you want
to follow in my footsteps.
It was that bad?
Bad, huh, bad isn't even the word.
Go on.
Okay, my senior year of high school,
my parents went out of town,
for business or something,
to like Morocco, I can't even remember.
Okay, wait is that an important detail?
No, not really.
Okay, just skip it.
Okay, short version it is.
They come home early and
my dad catches me in bed
with Tony Sambuco.
Seriously, what were you guys doing?
Nothing, fortunatley, we were asleep.
Okay, so that could be totally innocent.
Two buds falling asleep together,
you know, after studying all night.
Naked.
Right, okay, so not so innocent.
Nope, definitely not.
And you know how I like to fall asleep
with my hand on your.
Yeah.
And that's what my dad
saw when he walked in.
So you never actually told them?
No, think my dad's exact words were
please don't ever do that
in my house ever again.
And we haven't mentioned it since.
But their attitudes towards
me changed like right away.
Were you guys serious?
You and this Tony guy?
I mean I guess he was high school crush.
But we totally lost
touch after graduation.
You miss him?
Not when I'm with you.
Good answer.
I do miss one thing for that time.
What?
I miss how my mom treated
me before she found out.
(laughing)
[Gun] What's so funny?
Only the best part of Christmas.
You can watch this thing on the
computer now, did you know that?
Yeah, that pretty cool.
The kid with the blanket just
got all self righteous about
the meaning of Christmas and made
the other kids feel like crap.
(laughing)
Oh, he's totally harshing their buzz man.
Yeah, that's your favorite
part about Christmas?
Look, the bald kid
is pouting, I love it.
(laughing)
Okay, mom wants you to get ready
for the Mancuso's party, alright?
I'm ready.
Take that you stupid materialistic beagle.
(laughing)
Wow, okay dad, enjoy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
(orchestral music)
You know how much food she's making,
why'd you still have to make cookies?
And let Heather Mancuso
think I'm a bad guest?
Not on your life.
Man, should I have brushed up
on the box scores or learned the
names of a couple
quarterbacks or something?
You are really worried about
looking straight tonight.
Pot kettle black.
Whatever - [Gun] Yeah.
Just be yourself, okay?
Okay.
And I get the irony in it.
[Gun's Mother] Heather,
so good to see ya again.
Oh good to see you Anya.
Oh my aren't we festive.
Sweaters hide all manner
of sin, don't they.
Aren't you sweet, here, I made
this batch of cookies, just for you.
Nice and thick, just the way ya like them.
Speaking of, where is that handyman
that's been working
around your house all day.
Oh you mean Diego.
Oh he's been such a help around here.
I can't imagine what he offers you.
Tasty wiener.
Thank you Diego.
[Diego] My pleasure.
You've never had Sven's
bratwurst have you?
I mean, really, what's the point.
Olaf, so good to see you.
It's really great to
see you too Mrs. Mancuso.
Oh, Abby's around here somewhere
and there's some young people in the back.
Have fun.
Want to find the other young people?
(laughing)
Maybe their all playing
spin the bottle somewhere.
Oh, my favorite sport.
Yeah, like you've ever
kissed a girl before.
Yeah, Freida Baluchi, fifth grade.
Really?
Yep.
What was that like?
Well, ya know, made me gay.
Really, well I should
send her a thank you card.
Do that.
You know what I always wondered?
Are there any actual eggs in egg nog?
No one knows for sure.
Yeah, what is nog, anyway.
Yeah what is nog?
I don't know.
It's delicious though.
No, it's not.
You must be friends of Dorothy.
Excuse me?
Fred's daughter, Dorothy.
You go to school with her?
Uh, afraid not.
I'm Olaf Gunnunderson.
Sven and Anya's son.
That means nothing to me.
What a weird man.
Who was that?
I have no idea.
[Nathan] And who's Fred?
Not a clue.
Shall we go find some of
Dorothy's other friends?
In this crowd, good luck.
♫ Good King Wenceslas looked out
♫ On the feast of Stephen
♫ When the snow lay round about
He's really good.
[Nathan] He's got a great voice.
Yep my friends used to love having him
read us bedtime stories when I was a kid
I could totally see that
I think that's one of the reasons
he such a good professor, his students
love listening to his voice.
It's really soothing.
Except for that.
Hey, why didn't you ever go
to the college where he teaches.
I mean it would have been cheaper, right?
Yeah, it's just.
The gay thing?
No, not the gay thing.
I just didn't want to be known as.
Professor Gunnunderson's kid, you know.
I wasn't sure if the other professors
would treat me differently or if
everyone would just assume that I
got in because of him.
Makes sense, wanted to stand on
your own, be your own man,
Yep, exactly.
And of course, there's the gay thing.
Ah, I thought so.
♫ Deck the halls
♫ With boughs of holly
♫ Fa la la la la ♫
What up bitches.
See you boys got dragged to
this horrible shindig.
Lovely seeing you again Abby.
You too, air kisses.
I never told you this
before but you're dad is hot.
I know.
Alright, I do not need to hear this.
Too late, h-o-t, hot.
Is Olaf that hot?
I think so.
Guys please.
Oh, so he's embarrassed now.
Alright I have a question for you.
What does he have that I don't.
Oh.
I mean why would you move on
from this to this, no offense.
None taken.
So what does he have, that you don't.
[Abby] Besides the obvious, yeah.
He has
the truest heart I have ever seen.
Oh, that's nice.
He's seen your heart,
it's kind of gross.
You know what I mean.
He's smart,
and he's funny,
and he makes me feel better about
myself when he's around,
I do.
Aw, that's the most nauseating
thing I've ever heard.
I agree.
Okay, well, I'm off to find
a single straight man that's had
way too much to drink, wish me luck.
Good luck.
[Gun] Go get em.
Thank you.
She does have a nice ass though.
Great ass.
♫ Oh holy night

♫ It is the light of
our dear Savior's birth.
♫ Long lay the world

♫ 'Til He appeared and

[Gun] So did you have fun tonight?
Yeah, thanks to you.
[Gun's Mother] (giggling) Oh.
That woman has some powerful lungs on her.
(giggling)
Oh no.
What?
I think I know what that sound is.
[Gun's Mother] Mr. Gunnunderson,
is that mistletoe down there.
(laughing)
(phone ringing)
Hey there, hot stuff,
where's the boy toy?
Hey, off visiting some family friends.
Enjoying a little quiet time?
Actually, I was trying
to get a hold of my parents.
Olaf told me about them
ditching you, I'm sorry.
True, but if they hadn't
I would have never met you.
Ah, why Mr. Stanford, you
say the sweetest things.
Too bad it's completely wasted on me.
Why are all the best ones gay?
Ah, it's all part of God's plan.
Figures.
Abby, you've known Gun
a lot longer than I have,
why do you think he's
not out to his parents?
Well, maybe he told
his dad, but he forgot.
That sometimes happens.
I don't know, truth is,
we all want to be what
are parents want us to be.
And we all keep things from them.
Big things, little things,
you wouldn't believe the
secrets I keep from my mom.
Oh, like what?
Let's just say, that I can't
run for office in Mexico.
Good to know.
But seriously, I mean,
have you told you parents everything?
I mean everything?
No way.
No one our age does.
And obviously neither is Olaf.
But what if he never does it.
He will.
And besides when you two graduate
and you move in together they'll
probably suspect something.
See maybe not, people
have roommates all the time.
In a one bedroom
apartment in the middle of.
Boystown, USA with a drag queen
landlord name Ms. Monique?
You have put a lot of
thought into this, haven't you?
A little bit.
Be patient.
I'll try.
We always had such a great time.
I was painting sets and Olaf
was mastering the English accent.
My English accent was
amazing, it was, Governor.
People thought I was a transfer
student London, they did, Governor.
Was that Russian?
No, he looked so naddy in that
tweed and that English hat.
And she cried opening night,
and she closed closing night,
And every night in between.
Well, I was just so
proud of my little boy.
And I appreciated it.
Don't they look cute together?
Yeah, adorable.
(phone ringing)
Oh, um, would you just excuse
me just for a minute, I'll be right back.
Of course dear.
Must be so hard for him, being
away from his family at Christmas.
You know I don't think he
minds as much as you think.
From what he's told me, they're
not exactly the closest family.
You know, I should write them a letter
and give them a piece of my mind.
Leaving a poor child
like that, home alone.
Yeah, he's not alone, not this year.
Merry Christmas Father.
[Nathan's Father] Yes, Merry Christmas.
I see that you tried to call earlier,
we were in some tomb or another.
How's the Holy Land?
[Nathan's Father] Dusty,
I trust that you're being
a good house guest as your friend's home.
Yes, sir.
[Nathan's Father] Don't
overstay your welcome.
Remember, your a guest,
not part of their family.
No, sir, I won't forget that.
[Nathan's Mother] Remind him there's
a list of chores at home
that he needs to handle.
[Nathan's Father] Did
you hear your mother?
Yes, yes, chores, I got it, yes.
[Nathan's Mother] I found some authentic
frankincense and myrrh
at this little market
in Jerusalem so cheap.
Would that family like some?
I can send it over in this display
case they sell to tourists, I found
a much nicer one for our home.
What, no, no, that won't be necessary.
[Nathan's Father] So then, when
do you think you'll be
returning to the estate?
We need you to be a man and
handle things while we're gone.
Don't worry, don't worry, I'll
take care of everything, okay?
What do you mean you're leaving?
I'm going home, I have some
things I need to take care of.
Nobody's there, you want
to spend Christmas all alone.
Yeah, well sometimes I
feel all alone right here.
What?
Gun,
your parents think I'm just
some kid you know from college.
I'm no different from Abby in there,
except well they think you
have a future with her so.
That is not fair.
Well maybe not, but it's how I feel.
God we had more privacy in
a dorm full of 300 guys.
What?
Even if we were with
my parents, God forbid,
they would know who you are,
and how much you mean to me.
Yeah, and they wouldn't like it.
No, but they'd know, which is more than
you can say about your parents.
God, Gun, you may enjoy going back
in the closet but I don't.
I told you my reasons all right.
This is not easy for me.
You're 22 years old.
22.
You're graduating college this year.
Soon you're not going to be able
to use homework as an excuse for
why you're not dating.
I know, I know.
How clear do I need
to make this for you?
You're parents, they love you, okay?
They are not going to throw
you out just cause you're gay.
That's got to be real
easy for you to say.
You never cared about what
your parents think of you.
You got your trust fund, which means
you never have to worry about any money.
It must be really nice.
There are more important
things in life than money, Gun.
I would rather have my parents love
than their money any day and I can't
even believe you don't know that about me.
I'm sorry.
Please don't go.
I have to.
I may be,
I may be alone at Christmas
but it's where I belong, I have to go.
No.
You belong here, with me.
[Nathan] No.
I'll tell them.
What?
I'll tell them.
Yeah, before Christmas, I'll tell
them who you are, who I am.
You can't do this for me, you
have to do this for yourself.
I will, alright.
Just please, please, don't go.
I have to.
[Gun's Mother] Why have
you been so grumpy all day?
No reason.
It's almost Christmas, Santa won't bring
you any presents if
you keep that frown on.
Mom, I'm a little too old
to believe in Santa Clause.
Oh for Heaven's sake, you're never
too old to believe in Santa.
Why he may surprise you by
sliding down your chimney and leaving you
a nice present, just
when you need it most.
My chimney could definitely
use a present right about now.
Oh,
I know kids your age would rather
hang out with their friends
than they silly old parents.
Mom, you're not old.
You are a little silly though.
(laughing) Guilty as charged.
I love spending time
here with you and dad.
I mean I couldn't even imagine not
being able to spend
Christmas with you guys.
Oh you say that now but eventually
you're going to want to be on
your own with your own family.
I don't know, I mean, I may
never have a family like this.
Oh gobbledygook, you just
need time to meet people.
I know Abby thinks the world of you.
Mom, I'm not interested in Abby.
Fine, but once you finish college
and get out in the real world, it's
going to get harder to
meet the perfect girl.
Remember, when I was
your age I already had
your father and you in my life.
Do you ever wish that
you waited to have kids?
I can not imagine my
life without you and Sven.
I have no regrets.
Do you ever think
about having some more?
You know, while you're so young.
And ruin my girlish figure, Heaven's no.
Besides if you want a little
brother, you've got Nathan.
The way you two act it's
like you both came out of me.
No, he is not my brother.
He is not my brother.
Not my brother.
Alright,
feel better?
Absolutely.
Oh, baby boy.
But,
But what?
There's something that I
think we should talk about.
Is it more important that Christmas Eve
cause I've got a thousand
things for you to do today.
Yeah, yeah, it can wait.
(orchestral music)
(doorbell ringing)
Abby, oh, Heather.
Merry Christmas Mrs. Gunnunderson,
I was hoping to say
Merry Christmas to Olaf.
Oh how sweet, he's right inside, dear.
Here, it's my homemade smoked Herring.
Oh, how sweet, I haven't had a chance
to finish what you gave us last year
but, uh, it will freeze up nicely.
Oh, by the way, I tried the cookies
you brought to the party.
Oh?
Interesting texture, what was that?
Rosemary in the dough?
Oh, uh, yeah, Rosemary, yeah, sure.
How've you been?
Pretty lousy.
Anything I can do?
Hm, is a Christmas
miracle too much to ask for?
It's worth a try.
Abby!
Oh, she does take after you.
Nothing?
Nada.
So much for Christmas miracles.
Let's go mother, we have
some partying to do.
I told you, your son was
a bad influence on her.
Oh, don't be such a nelly,
so long, and thanks for all the fish.
(laughing)
(orchestral music)
[Gun's Father] Nathan?
Mr. Gunnunderson, hi.
I thought you'd be back home by now.
Right, okay, have you ever seen a movie
where people are flying
somewhere on Christmas Eve
and the plane is like totally empty?
You mean, like the one with the snakes?
Uh, exactly.
Oh, those snakes freak me out man.
All squirmy and slimy.
Anyway,
it's not like that in real life.
Every flight home was booked so
the earliest that I could get
out was tomorrow afternoon.
Well what are you doing sitting here?
You guys don't need an
outsider around for the holidays.
And Christmas is about family.
True,
but if you can't be with your
family you can be with ours.
Seriously?
The more the merrier,
a merrier Christmas.
Thanks, but I doubt
Gun even wants me around.
You know with Abby there and everything.
Oh I don't think she's
really Olaf's type anymore.
Really?
You can't tell but I
think Abby's a little wild.
A wild thing.
I kind of suspected as much.
And Olaf.
Olaf needs a nice girl.
Right, a nice girl.
He's so focused on school right now,
he can't see what he really needs.
He's disciplined, just like his mother.
She really likes to be disciplined.
Back to the house?
Yeah, I'd like that.
Good, then you can drive, I
have no idea where my car is.
[Gun's Mother] Papa, is that you?
[Gun's Father] Hey mama.
Well get in here and cheer up the boy.
He's gloomier than a blackout
during a Wisconsin winter
and that's darn gloomy,
I'll tell you what,
that's why we moved to sunnier
climates, don't ya know.
Look what I found.
What?
Nathan!
I, uh, couldn't get a flight
out, I hope you don't mind.
Never, oh, precious, cookie?
Yeah.
Olaf's the decapitator, he
always go right for the head.
I'm not going to touch that one.
I'm glad you're back.
Me too.
So where'd you end
up staying last night?
Hotel, by the airport.
Gross.
For real.
I'm sorry.
No, no, I'm sorry.
Look when you showed up here,
I had no idea how we were
going to get through Christmas,
but after you left, well,
Well, what?
After you left, I realized
how much I loved you.
Past tense?
No, no, present tense,
future tense, whatever.
And I'm going to tell them.
Like I said, don't, don't do
it for me, do it for yourself.
Look anything that I do
for myself, I do for you.
What does that mean?
I have absolutely no idea,
it just kind of popped out.
[Gun's Mother] You boys, come on,
there's warm strudel waiting for you.
We're coming.
I wish.
Papa.
Oh, mama.
Baby boy.
Well, before we start.
Anya, I know you've had your pretty
little eyes on this for months now.
It isn't.
Merry Christmas, mama.
[Gun's Mother] Oh Sven.
It's perfect.
Oh, mama.
Go Packers.
(laughing)
Now what about.
Oh crap oh!
No, you guys, you didn't
have to get me anything.
Oh pish posh.
I couldn't not let you have something
to open on Christmas morning.
Thank you, thank you.
Dump it out already.
(laughing)
Well, it's silly, but now
you have something sweet.
Yeah, these will probably
last him until about midterms.
He's got a major oral fixation.
Oh, me too, what ya know.
We didn't know what you wanted
but we hope you like it.
No this is, this is perfect.
It's exactly what I wanted.
[Nathan] That was an
amazing dinner, Anya.
Yeah, it was a good job mom.
It was nothing, just weeks of planning,
and four hours of hard work this morning
and too many darn people in this house
to talk to, I'm losing my voice.
But it was all worth it,
as my mother taught me,
If you put enough meat in
a man's mouth, he's happy.
Am I right?
Right, that's always been my experience.
Why don't you go see Abby after dinner?
I don't want to see Abby after dinner.
Well, she has some lovely friends.
Oh, I bet should find a
nice date for Nathan here.
Are you staying for New Years Eve, dear.
I don't want her to
find a date for Nathan.
[Gun's Mother] Olaf.
Gun, calm down.
No, no, I need to be angry, okay.
I need to get my adrenaline going
if I'm going to be able to do this.
Is it because she didn't go to college?
No, mom, she's not sweet.
Not in that way.
Actually, she's really pretty fabulous.
Then what's the problem dear?
It's not a problem, it's.
I'm gay.
Nathan isn't my roommate.
He's my boyfriend.
He's my lover.
He's my everything.
I love you.
Did you guys here what I said, I'm gay.
I'm gay too if that wasn't
clear, it was clear, okay.
I told you so.
(laughing)
You owe me 100 bucks, kiddo,
I'm taking it out of your inheritance.
What are you talking about?
He lost the bet and I won.
When, when did you guys make this bet?
Oh, cripes, when was it, Sven?
Oh, I think it was your sophomore year,
I don't know, my memories
not so good these days.
I think it was about that.
You talked about this two years ago?
Oh, Lord no, sophomore
year of high school.
(laughing)
Okay, how?
Oh, well there was the swim team,
- and the drama club.
- [Gun's Mother] Yeah.
Oh and dating that poor Abby girl,
oh geez, if you ask me, she likes her
muffins a little too much
if you know what I'm saying.
[Gun] Mom.
Oh sweetie, it's okay.
Really, it's okay.
By telling us, you've proven what
kind of man you are, an honest one.
We'd love you no matter what son.
Don't you know that by now?
I guess I should've.
I love you guys.
We love you.
Always have
always will.
And if we didn't, we'd have to
return all those presents and I
didn't keep the receipts.
Now, as for you,
the top bunk, really?
Oh, mama, stop it.
A mother needs to know these things.
No, no, she doesn't.
Is it too early to start
nagging about grandkids?
- Yes.
- [Nathan] Yes.
Brett Farve Gunnunderson
has a nice ring to it.
- Leave the boys be, Anya.
- [Gun's Mother] Oh, fine.
I just remembered what I said
to you in the hospital
after you were born.
What, what did you say?
I said, All you need is love.
[Gun's Mother] Oh, cripes, is that it?
That's what was playing
on the radio in the room.
[Gun's Father] Still applies.
Yeah, it does.
Now, while we're finishing eating,
why don't you go put on your real clothes
and do something with that hair,
you look like a Mormon,
for crying in the sink.
(music)
Mom, dad, it's me, it's Nathan.
Look, I'm calling.
I'm calling to say thank you
for not kicking me out of the house
when you found out I was gay.
I do realize that that was a big
step for you both and I
appreciate it so thank you.
But just so you know, I
need to talk about my life,
and my boyfriend, yes, my boyfriend,
whenever I want because you both
need to know who I really am,
that's how families are supposed
to work and I don't know,
if you don't like it,
if you don't like it I have
another family here, okay?
So, call me back when
you get this message.
Cause I really want to talk to you.
So, what do you guys think?
Can you breathe in that?
It's so cute, I told you a little
color would do wonders for you.
Merry Christmas.
And I do love you both,
okay, no matter what.
