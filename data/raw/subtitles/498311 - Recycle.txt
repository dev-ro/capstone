Please help me take the books out.
What's the matter?
You've dragged me down!
What have I done to you?
It's all your fault.
You shouldn't announce my new book
"The Recycle" so soon.
You should have waited
until I've almost finished.
Now, even creating the female
character is making me stressed
The male lead, Guo Rong,
of my previous novel
I can only pick the one
after the fourth draft.
I got it, really got it...
You don't have to finish it in a hurry
Just take your time.
An early announcement
is just a promotional strategy
The later the book comes out
the more people will yearn for it
When the time is right
for " Re-Cycle" to be released
I guarantee you that
it will be a best-seller
(When love leads us astray
and there is no way forward)
(Based on the novel by Chu Xun)
(My Love)
On behalf of our company
and Miss Chu Xun
I'd like to thank our friends
from the media
for coming to this press conference
It's our first time
to make a film based on Miss Chu's novel.
May I ask a question?
Among the three volumes of " My Love"
Why did you choose this volume
to adapt for the movie?
After reading the three volumes
of " My Love" ,
I am all amazed that
Miss Chu has finished
three perfect love novels
in only three years time.
Her increditable imagination
and creativity
are really admirable.
Besides, the ending
of the third volume
is the best part to express
the faithfulness of love.
Miss Chu Xun
the love story between the two characters
Guo Rong and Yong Lin
in your book " My Love"
was very detailed
Did that come from your own experience?
Is that true?
Well, I admit that some of
it was my own experience
When I write
I would subconsciously put myself
into Yong Lin's character
So, each "Yong Lin"
is a part of me.
In that case, if you are
inseparable from Yong Lin
then I think a lot of readers
would love to know who Guo Rong is.
That guy... does no longer exist.
In fact, Miss Chu
has started writing her new book.
Can you tell us
something about the new book?
This is a book about supernatural.
What's the name of it?
This book is named "The Recycle" .
"The Recycle"
Have you actually seen a ghost?
No, I haven't
but, I have heard
about some weird things
What kind of weird things?
You'll find out
when you read "the Recycle"
Are you afraid of seeing ghosts?
Sure! I believe a lot of
people are afraid.
Even though I'm afraid
I would still like to see one.
Why?
I can feel the terror well up
from the depths of my heart.
You know, self-experience
is crucial to a writer.
Do you have an entry permit?
No... I haven't .
Sorry, you can't get in.
But I know her.
You can't get in without a permit.
It is the rule.
Please do me a favor.
I've got something urgent. No way.
Ladies and gentlemen,
now it's time for
the readers to get an autograph
from Miss Chu Xun
and this is the end of the
press conference.
Sorry for the inconvenience
Ting-yin.
Congratulations!
Thank you.
When did you come back?
Last night.
Do you have some time?
Can I talk with you?
Ting-yin...
You're here.
Hi!
We need to go back in.
The autograph session is about to start.
I don't have anything to say to you
I'm busy today...we'll talk later.
Let's go.
When did he come back?
He said yesterday.
Then when will there be a
continuation of 'My Love'
Come on. Let's go.
(The female lead is called)
(" Fang Yu-ling" .)
(She has very... very long hair.)
(She is too tall that make her)
(look a bit strange.)
(She has a strong desire of surviving.)
(One day, Yu-ling stayed at home alone.)
(The protagonist is called)
( Fung Sin-mei.)
(She is an adventurous lady)
Hello...
Hello...
Hello, Chu, this is Sandy.
Yes, what is it?
Do you have time tomorrow?
It should be okay.
What's happening tomorrow?
Nothing. I just want to talk to you
My bro has been backed to Hong Kong.
In that case, I'm not free.
Come on, is that okay
to dine with me, then?
We haven't seen each other
for a long time.
Okay, as long as
you don't talk about him
Where shall we meet?
Shall we meet at 2 o'clock outside Sogo?
Okay, see you tomorrow.
Okay. See you tomorrow.
Hello...
Hao Ran is back, did you know?
You've asked again and again!
I said not to talk about him...
He and Xu Fen are divorced.
Won't you give him another chance?
What chance?
Did he ask you to tell me that?
I'm sorry,
I've been so vexed
with my writing lately
and I haven't been in a good mood.
I really don't want to talk about him.
Actually, I should say sorry to you.
My bro asked me to do so, what can I do?
He will ask me about you when I get home.
He really wants to see you.
When did he divorce?
Three months ago.
See! As I said, they'd get
divorced sooner or later.
How about this, I ask him to find you.
Please do listen to him, I know
you don't want to.
Well, how is your new book?
When will it be published?
I just start writing.
But I don't know why...
I just can't manage it.
Your inspiration will come.
Maybe.
In these days, I saw something
weird at home.
People said, writing this thing
will bring strange things.
Last night, I felt...
there's someone else in my house.
One more person?
I found a few strands of hair
much longer than mine
in the kitchen sink.
I think too much writing
is making you hyper sensitive
But...
I did see a figure.
Did you just mistake?
Please don't keep staring,
it's really scaring!
Really? Many people have told the same.
Hello...
(Sin-mei finds some strands of long hair...)
(Floating on the water, behind)
(the shower curtain.)
(There's no reply)
(Only raucous sound comes from)
(the other end of the receiver)
(The female lead is called)
(" Fang Yu-ling" .)
(She has very long hair.)
(She is too tall...)
(One night, Fang receives three)
(consecutive phone calls at home)
(weird sound comes from the receiver)
Are...are you alright?
Why do you look like this?
I'm alright...what are you doing here?
What's up? Why do you come here?
I tried to call you,
but the line was busy,
so I come up to see you.
Are you sure you are okay?
I am fine.
what do you want, coming here?
I wanted to see you.
there's something I need
to talk to you about...
can I come in?
No, you cannot!
Then...can you give me
just time for a dinner?
You seem frightened
Really?
Is it because the writing is very hard?
If so, you should get some good rest.
no
I divorced.
I know, Sandy told me.
Then, Ting-yin...
I think we can...
Don't tell me what you want anymore.
Anyway, what you want,
you should have done 8 years ago.
No need to wait until now.
Yes, you're right.
But 8 years ago
I really thought I would try
Thought about it
Eight years ago, when I was going to tell
Xu Fen that I wanted a divorce
she suddenly told me that
She was pregnant.
So I...
You didn't want to hurt her,
that's why you didn't say it, right?
Yes, that was the reason.
Then why did you say that you were just
making a short trip to see your father-in-law
and ended up gone for so long?
because my father-in-law died
in a accident
I had to take care of his business.
I did write to ask you to wait for me
I did get a lot of your letters
but they all told me to wait for this
and wait for that.
The ones I received in the later days...
I never read them
Let's stop here,
I don't want to hear anymore
If I had waited
it would have taken me
8 years until today.
(Ting-yin...)
(The sucking force is accelerating)
(At the end of the corridor, a beam)
(of light appears,turns red and strong.)
(Go home immediately.)
(She presses for the 1th floor)
(but the lift stops at the 7th)
(and the door opens.)
(The corridor.)
Grandma, the lift is here!
we're not there yet,
come back inside.
we still have to go further down
Why are you here?
Come and take a seat.
Uncle, could you tell me...
what is this place?
Think thoroughly
Do you know how you got here?
When I got to the street,
everything was different ...
In the lift,
I saw a grandma and grandson.
Then...then...
I... I don't know.
This is a place where you should not be.
But why are you here?
You think I'm the same as you?
Do you remember what you've done?
all the strange things started
to happen after writing the Recycle
It's because of this?
This place is created by you.
It's not only belonged to you,
but to the others too.
In this place...
You are all creators.
Could you explain it further?
I don't understand.
This is a space for abandoned.
The things created have been abandoned.
They would appear here again.
At the same time,
they may disappear all of a sudden.
All these are just a kind of cycle,
a re-cycle.
We are all here...
just because we are a group of abandoned.
I think you have to go now.
What's happening?
stop talking now
Mister, aren't you going inside?
I can't go inside every space.
When you see the things
start eroding, you have to go.
Otherwise you will vanish
with them together.
Remember, you can't stay here for long.
Follow me.
Could you tell me who you are?
I don't know who I am
We have no names.
Could you tell me where I am?
Why is it like this?
This is a world that you've
forgotten and abandoned.
Abandoned?
That means, whatever you didn't
want would come down here
even your thoughts and
things you didn't do
would happen here.
The 'spiritual world' that
I thought about ... really exists?
Look behind you! do you remember?
I am sure you have thrown many
toys away during your childhood.
All of them can be found here.
Now you know the true
meaning of abandon.
You can't stay here.
You must return to your place..
So, how can I leave this place?
Can you show me the way?
I know there is a place
called the"Transit" .
But I don't know how to get there.
Even you get there,
this still means nothing.
Why?
Recycle is fast approaching.
We have to run.
Why? What is going to happen?
If we don't run, we would be eroded.
We would be in deep trouble!
Go!
Hey! What happened?
If we couldn't get out of there in time,
we would have been eroded.
Let me introduce you to someone.
He must know where the Transit is.
Granny, why are you here?
Remember I told you earlier,
I belong to this place.
You should tell her...
she has to leave this place asap.
This place is dangerous
I'd like to...
but I don't know how to get out
You wanted ideas to write your book
you look for inspiration
and put yourself
into this hopeless situation
Tell us how to get to the Transit.
You wanna go to the Transit?
Granny, please help me.
I do not know this would have happened.
Even I tell you where it is,
you cannot find it out by yourself.
I'll take her to the place.
Follow me...this way.
There is a long way
from here to the Transit.
Unfortunately, it has not clearly
stated the exact location.
There are only several hints
from the book.
What hints?
Wild flowers, pick it.
Paper money on the road, walk on it.
Crescent moon, red earth,
fading sky and fading land.
Rootless grass, it's near.
When you arrive at the Transit,
it's time to be apart.
Then, what's next?
The book is too old.
It cannot be read further.
Take the paper money
Sis, when you walk across the bridge,
remember to hold your breath.
Otherwise, we would be in trouble.
Okay, follow me.
Sis, you go first.
Where to go?
That well is an exit.
Run! I can find you!
Little girl
Are you here?
Little girl
Don't mind it, come over here!
Don't look! Hurry up.
Which way?
Straight ahead. Hurry up!
Nobody comes after us.
Still be scared?
What are those things?
They are aborted babies.
How poor they are.
Aborted babies?
They keep growing there.
When they grow up,
they have to leave there.
to another place they belong to.
Could you please not
leaving me behind again?
I feel so weird.
You said that the abandoned
things would turn to be here.
But why do they look so terrible?
Are you okay?
Why do you look so pale?
The closer the Transit,
the stronger the power of light. I...
I'll be fine.
I must get you out of here.
There are so many flowers!
Flowers, crescent moon, red earth,
fading sky and fading land, rootless grass...
Flowers, crescent moon, red earth,
fading sky and fading land, rootless grass...
Flowers, crescent moon, red earth,
fading sky and fading land, rootless grass...
Flowers, crescent moon...
What is the purpose of picking
these flowers?
I am not sure yet..
Granny said we have to pick them,
sure they'll be useful.
I don't know why...
I feel that I've seen you somewhere
How could you have seen me before?
Why...why don't you give me a name?
a good idea, afterall,
I don't know your name
How about ...
Ting-yu ... How is it?
Ting-yu? Good! It sounds beautiful!
Ting-yu, Ting-yu...
My name is Ting-yin, it is nice.
Who are they?
They are the ones who were
buried below the gravestones.
But no one remembers them.
No one?
They have not been
worshipped for a long time.
So they appear here
They block our way.
How can we walk through them?
Don't be afraid, just follow me.
What's up?
You said they have not been
worshipped for a long time,
didn't you?
That's right.
Ting-yu, do you have
some more flowers?
No!
What can we do? Let's go!
You take the paper money with you,
they'll be useful.
How many further levels we have
to go before arrive at the Transit?
Why are your hands so cold?
I am fine, I think
we are at the Transit now.
Can you leave this place with me?
No, if I go to your space,
I would become a wanderings spirit.
That would be too poor for me.
So what can I do?
I cannot leave you behind.
Don't worry, I belong to here.
Wild flowers, pick it.
Paper money on the road, walk on it.
Crescent moon, red earth,
fading sky and fading land,
rootless grass, it's near...
When you arrive at the Transit,
it's time to be apart.
Ting-yu...
What's happening?
The Transit...
I arrived.
You better hurry.
Are you okay?
You made us here.
You created us and then you dumped us.
I have to make you stay here forever,
never leave this place
for a lifetime long!
Ting-yu, tell me what should I do?
Ting-yu.
The story ending
she's written is here already
Already here? She wrote it?
what are you talking about?
Who are you?
Mom!
What did you call me?
If I really decided to wait for you,
I should have to wait for eight years,
until today, shouldn't it?
Ting-yin
Eight years ago...
I had your baby too!
Your explaination,
I would be better off not listening to it
Don't worry...
I had an abortion
Do you know how painful
it is to have to make such a decision?
Please...
don't look for me anymore...
When I first came here,
I was very angry with you,
I asked grandpa why mama didn't want me
Grandpa said everyone has
their troubles that they cannot tell others
You didn't want to abandon me at first
right, mama?
Remember the place
where the aborted babies live?
I grew up there too.
It is so terrible.
So you know how scared I was
right?
Ting-yu, it wasn't that
mama didn't want you
just that mama...
I am so sorry!
just that mama...
Grandpa!
You finally recognized me, huh?
She wants you to come here
and asks you why.
Why don't you go with mama?
Come with me.
You want me to stay with you?
In fact, you could live with me.
But you gave it up.
It was you, you gave up.
Ting-yu!
Ting-yu...
Ting-yu, you must remember
your own name!
Can you hear me?
(Remind Tin-yu not to forget her name.)
(Gradually disappears in the white light.)
Abby, I write another version.
The storyline has been changed.
The first draft,
the story of a female writer,
is too much like my life story,
so I dumped it.
Now, it is a story
about reincarnation in China.
I am now going to e-mail it to you.
Okay, bye!
When I write, I would subconsciously
put myself into the character
It does notjust belong to you,
but to the others, too.
