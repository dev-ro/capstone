Remove your shirt
Lower your pants
I said lower your pants
Stop there
Higher
Right there
There
It's all there
What are you doing here?
I was in the neighborhood
Put these over there, please
They're supposed to come tomorrow 
 about the adoption
I have no idea what else they might ask
He's back
Dad is back
I know
They let me know two months ago
I think it would be ok 
 that after all this time we let things be
You think it's ok?
Huh?
Did you forget?
What's the deal?
Speak up you old fag!
Turn around
Go on
You're crazy
Turn around and take off your shirt
Give me the money and I'll do it
First you take it off, then you get the money
Now give it to me
Turn around and lower your pants
Go screw yourself you old fag! 
 Give me that shit!
Come on!
Here's more
Now you turn around and lower your pants
You old fag!
You're screwed, you faggot!
That's enough, stop there
Sell me that car
Where are you gonna get the money, kid?
I'll pay you bit by bit
Bit by bit?
It's 2000 bucks
So take 800
Where did you get this money?
I'll give you the rest next week
It's the brothers, alright. 
 They're at a table in the back
Let's go get 'em
Shit, leave him. Leave him.
If you're here for your wallet ... 
 ... you're not getting it back
So get lost, you old fag
I'm not here for my wallet
You want me to break your face again? 
 Go on, get lost!
I said get lost!
There's more at home
Who the hell are the parts for?
For me, of course
Who else?
Who's gonna pay for them?
Start looking now
Good morning
Someone brought a package for you 
 I put it on your desk
Where were you born?
Hey, waiter! Hey!
Another portion of fries ...
... and a beer
Where are you from?
From here, from Caracas
And where do you live?
Around
Do you have a wife?
No, I never married
And why do you speak funny like that?
Because when I was a child 
 we lived somewhere else
Do you live with your family?
Hello
What's up?
Everything's good
Yeah, let's do that 
 I'm coming
I have to go
You gonna finish that?
Tell me
It's the one in the back
- Let's get out of here 
 - Yeah, let's go
Don't lose him, please
Sixth floor
Fourteenth floor
- Hello 
 - Hello
I'm looking for one of the young men 
 who hang out out here
That bunch of kids ... all they do is steal
His name is Elder
I don't know him
But you can ask her
She knows them all
Can I speak with you for a minute?
What for?
Have you seen Elder?
Give me 30 bucks and I'll tell you
He wakes up for a while 
 and then goes to sleep again
Here
Don't tell anyone he's here
When did they bring me here?
About a week ago
You've been sleeping ever since
Who beat you up?
My girlfriend's brothers
What did you do to her?
Nothing
I swear to you I didn't do anything to her
Do you like the food?
It's my mother's recipe
She taught it to me
Does she still cook for you?
She died
My dad died too
When I was a kid
Did your dad hit you?
Mine beat me a lot
If you had children would you beat on them?
No
I would
So that they learned 
 what things are like from early on
I'll do them
Whats up?
I picked up a couple of movies
What are you up to?
Nothing
So you screwed me after all
Is this what you want?
Pick it up, you filthy rat
I may be a rat ... but I'm not a faggot like you
What did you say?
I said I'm not a faggot like you
So I'm a faggot?
Are you sure?
Your turn
Let's see who's the bigger faggot
Armando!
Armando!
Armando!
Armando!
It was my bad
Forgive me
Let's go, let me take you to a hospital
Just go
Go away or I'll call the police
This will protect you
- Armando? 
 - How are you, Fernando?
- Congratulations 
 - Thank you
- Come in 
 - Thank you
Armando!
- Thank you for coming, brother 
 - You're welcome
Look how gorgeous he is
How old is he?
Just turned two months old
Let his uncle hold him
Pass it here, come on! That's it ... here, here!
Looking nice, huh?
Yeah, it's looking real nice
What happened with the 1200 you owe me?
I'll give it to you this week
Fine
But the car remains mine until then
Good morning
I'm replacing the incisors
It's a Corsa model from 2000
Take a look at the engine, it's an original
Is it yours?
I still owe some money to the owner
Where is the owner?
Good morning
What can I do for you?
How much does this young man 
 owe you for the car?
1200 dollars
- 1200? 
 - Uh-huh
May I?
You can cash it anytime
There's catfish
But they hide under the rocks
My dad used to bring me here to fish
You wanna know the truth?
My dad is in jail
He killed one of my friends
Just because he felt like it
And your dad, is he dead?
No
But I wish he was
I want to meet him
Hello
If you move I'll kill you, you cocksucker
- How are you, cousin? 
 - Everything's great
How are things? All good?
- What's up? All good?

Of course, any time
So, how do you know each other?
We did some work together
And now we're like business partners
Aren't you having anything to drink?
Come on man, let's dance
Come on mom, let's dance
Come on! Come!
Sorry, I'm going out for a minute
What are you doing here?
What do you mean?
Get out!

You're shameless! Get out!
I'll get you a pillow
