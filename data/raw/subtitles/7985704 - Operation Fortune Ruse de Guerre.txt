Nathan.
How are you, old man?
Very good.
Thank you, Mr. Knighton.
You look like
the walking dead.
Yes. Well, I'm always
a little bit cold
when I've
just got out of bed.
Perhaps you can tell me
why I've been summoned,
8:00 a.m.
on a Sunday morning?
Well, if you'd care to
study the film, you'll see
that two nights ago,
some heavily guarded cargo
was ambushed outside
a facility in Johannesburg,
where 20 security guards
were mercilessly annihilated.
I want you to retrieve
what went missing
and to find out
who the seller is,
who the buyer is,
and what it is.
So we don't know exactly
what it is, sir?
No. That is the mystery.
But our analysts
in intelligence reported
it very quickly
became extremely popular
with the wrong sort of people.
And with a price tag
of around ten billion,
I don't think we can afford
for it to remain a mystery
much longer.
It's been given the name
"the Handle."
But why me?
Why not the official
intelligence branch?
Ruse de guerre, Nathan.
An unorthodox approach to war.
I need a creative, cunning
and unconventional vision
to retrieve
this kind of mercurial threat.
A courier on a bicycle
in congested traffic,
not the official team.
They'd take forever to wade
through the administration,
and the clock doth ticketh.
So, who will be
heading up your team?
Oh, the usual chap.
Orson Fortune.
Oh, fuck.
That man is
an administrative nightmare.
He can't fly
unless there's a private jet
because of claustrophobia.
Then he needs sedating
with the finest claret
because of agoraphobia.
And then there's
the rehabilitation
in the Maldives
because
of cloudo-bloody-phobia.
Yes, I understand, sir.
But when you cut back
on his expenses
and created
a mental health department,
it was a perfect storm.
He's trained to exploit
every system presented,
which is why he is
the very bicycle courier
you require.
Where is he?
Well, it's funny
you should say that, sir.
He is on one of his, uh,
rehabilitation retreats.
Yes, you are paying for that,
sir, but don't worry.
I think I can pull him in.
The fuck are you
doing here, Nathan?
Everything all right,
Orson?
No, it's not.
I'm supposed to be
on holiday,
and you're supposed to be
4,000 miles in that direction.
Actually, it's 3,000 miles
in that direction.
But whatever.
-Mind if I come in?
-Yes, I fucking do.
Aren't you gonna ask
why I'm here?
No, I'm fucking not,
because you're not staying.
Wouldn't be here
if it wasn't serious.
I don't care
how fucking serious it is.
I'm on holiday,
and I'm not interested
in working at the moment.
There's a price to pay
for possessing
a unique set of skills,
being as brilliant
as you are,
and please don't take this
the wrong way,
as a private contractor,
your government pays you
handsomely for.
I'm ignoring this apparition.
I'm talking to an empty space.
You're going home.
And I'm gonna
meet my girlfriend...
at the bar.
Ah, yes. About
that girlfriend of yours.
It seems as though she's not
just your girlfriend.
But don't worry,
we'll fly her home first class.
Have you been
spying on me, Nathan?
I am sorry.
But something rather nasty
has been stolen.
How nasty?
Under file A is file B.
That's the list
of nefarious potential buyers
whose interests
have been aroused.
We don't know
what was stolen.
That remains a mystery
for you to solve.
But we need to stop it
getting onto the open market.
Threat's imminent.
How imminent?
Imminently imminent.
Put it this way.
When you hit the ground,
you'll be running, literally.
We've got the plane.
The BBJ, this year's model.
And all your medicinal
requirements.
'82, '96, 2004.
Marinate.
And I'll see you
in two minutes.
Fine. So Orson
will be heading your team.
Will you be using John,
the comms man?
- Ah, sadly not, sir.
- Isn't he the best?
Well, he might be good...
...but he turned out
to be something of
a duplicitous snake.
He went over
to Mike Hook's team.
Ah, Mike, the competition.
Yes. Just on that note, sir,
I do hope we won't be competing
for the same prize
on this mission with Mike.
There is more than one
security department
in this government.
Mike is on another job.
Very good, sir.
-Afternoon, Lucinda.
-Sir.
Oh, I was starting to worry.
Had to get changed.
Didn't we all?
-Captain, can we
warm the engines up?
-Right away, sir.
Isn't that the '82?
It's still drinking well.
Isn't this
my medicinal requirement?
Yes.
Thirsty, were ya?
Party for one,
like all your parties?
Is it the usual team?
Minus John.
Where's John?
-John got poached.
-By who?
By "whom." Never mind.
But I do mind. I know John.
I like John.
I trust John. He's a pro.
Someone paying him more?
Yes.
If I asked,
would you pay me more?
-You can ask.
-Will you pay me more?
No.
You're above
that grubby self-interest.
You're a patriot.
And besides,
no one gets treated
like you get treated.
When you say "you,"
you really mean you.
Anyway, who's my footman?
I found
a splendid replacement.
-What's his name?
-Sarah Fidel.
Strong nom de guerre.
-Never heard of him.
-That's because
she's an American.
"She."
Lucinda, bring
the 2004 Haut-Brion, please.
Ah.
I'll help myself to a beer.
I have a rather
fabulous replacement
for Comms John.
An American, much more
versatile and creative.
Sarah Fidel.
Didn't she work with Mike?
Mike, consistent
with his character,
abandoned her in Beirut,
which is where
I picked her up.
Any other footmen?
Yes, this young man,
JJ Davies.
There really isn't very much
he can't do either.
Comms, guns, driving,
diving, rapping, slapping,
you name it.
They are both
two comprehensive footmen,
the perfect all-rounders.
Isn't that JJ?
What's he doing here?
He's joined the team.
He's a good kid,
but isn't he a bit green?
He's been very busy
since you last saw him.
He's what you might call
enthusiastic, hungry, keen.
Don't put your fingers
near his mouth.
-JJ.
-Sir.
Mr. Fortune, meet Miss Fidel.
Miss Fidel.
Your Highness.
Apparently,
you're the new John.
Not meaning a toilet
or prostitute's client,
I take it?
Please don't pee on me.
I don't do that anymore.
John didn't have
a personality.
I liked John.
You can call her "John"
if it makes you
more comfortable.
He was reliable.
Wasn't that reliable.
Heard he got poached
by my old team.
Your old team?
The other leading
private contractor
favored by your government.
You worked for Mike?
Mike, the competition Mike?
You may not like Mike,
but Mike is good.
What we got?
Bagman, coming in
on a flight with a hard drive.
We need to track him,
see where he takes it.
I'm gonna
keep an eye on you,
feed you
constructive information,
play the right music.
I'll control the turntables,
you control the dance floor.
Like to dance?
I liked John.
We'll send him
some flowers
on your behalf.
Got anything yet?
Okay, I'm getting somewhere
very slowly.
Still dialing in.
Can you hear it?
Do you actually know
how to use a computer?
Well, I'm sure I can find
my way if you just tell me
where the on button is.
Nathan,
we've been here three hours,
and my feet are hurting.
She's your responsibility.
She slips up, it's on you.
I hired her. I trust her.
We have a three-hour window,
okay?
He's gotta be with us soon.
In fact, on cue.
-Think I got him.
-About time.
Hiding in that crocodile
should be the drive.
What's on the drive?
We don't know.
Orson,
just remember he's a bagman.
A retired professor,
not a threat
or a black belt in Mogadishu.
I'll try not to
frighten him to death.
We just need to know
who he's delivering it to.
Whiz kid,
what am I looking for?
Brown hat, spectacles,
crocodile-skin briefcase,
upper level.
He should be coming
into your peepers now.
I'm in his phone,
and I'm gonna send him
a message.
"Car is delayed."
You see him, sweetheart?
Got him.
Sending him
to Luigi's Coffee Bar,
ground floor.
How do you know it's him?
You dance, I'll play,
remember?
Jane, he's heading your way.
In position.
JJ, take the B stairs.
He passing me now,
heading to coffee shop.
He's all yours.
I still see you in position.
Jane, respond.
Jane?
Wakey-wakey, whiz kid.
Orson, I'm getting
no response from Jane.
JJ, keep your peepers peeled
and your hands
out of your pockets.
Peepers peeled.
Hands flying free.
Marcia, the job is yours.
Catch him at the counter.
Confirm when
the tracker's in place.
Moving in now.
Why do I smell
something ratty?
I smell it too.
Marcia,
confirm tracker in place.
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.
Confirm tracker in place.
Why do I get the feeling
we're not the only team
in town?
Can't be. I would know.
Okay, that's odd.
Either it's a glitch
in the network or someone's--
someone is very good.
In my experience,
it's seldom the network.
Who could do that?
John.
John could do that.
Smells like Team B.
Nathan, what the fuck
are they doing here?
If that weasel John is here,
it means that toad Mike
is too.
Stand by.
Nathan.
Mike isn't
on a different job, is he, sir?
Or is it a coincidence
that his team
is at Madrid Airport?
If he's there, it isn't
because of my department.
My world works
in a similar fashion to yours.
The government likes to keep
departments competing.
Competition
for the best condition.
Mike only has two talents.
Blowing his cover
and blowing himself.
But thanks for the heads-up.
Orson, confirmed.
Mike is here
to track the crocodile.
Mike's clumsy and predictable.
They're not here to track him.
They're here to pick him up.
I've resolved the glitch.
We're going back live.
JJ, change of policy.
Don't go in, go out.
Exit door F pincer.
On it, boss.
You have two inbound,
8:00 and six o'clock.
Understood.
Just tell me they haven't
tasered the girls.
Uh... Oh, yes, tasered.
Let me feel your rhythm,
whiz kid.
- Count me in.
- Three, two, one.
Take a deep breath.
That's right.
Our man is en route to exit.
Main gate departures.
Two B's in pursuit.
I'm on it. I'm exiting
through the parallel doors.
He's moving to taxi 49502.
-Nathan, you're needed.
-Incoming.
JJ, your location?
Exiting through
east parallel doors.
-Señor? Hola, señor.
-Mr. Bakker.
Oh, no, no, no.
I cannot come with you.
Two more B's
posing in the car.
- No, no, please.
- Come with us.
What's going on?
Heart. Heart. Heart.
JJ, wheel.
Heart.
- What's wrong with him?
- Don't know.
-Keeps saying he's hot.
-No, no. Heart.
Loosen his tie.
He doesn't feel very hot.
He's not hot, you idiots.
He has a heart condition.
We have two of them
in pursuit.
The drive will be encrypted,
but I can clone it remotely.
Connect me to the hard drive.
We're roadblocked.
They have my wife.
They will kill her.
JJ, lock the doors.
There's a dozen of them,
fully armed.
Get out!
Get out of the vehicle, now!
I need more time.
I need another 20 seconds.
They don't know me, my face.
You go to the Duchess.
Table 12, 6:00 p.m.!
Save my wife!
Four.
Three... two...
Open the door!
I've got it. Let it go.
We're gonna need a shovel.
-Nathan.
-Mike.
Nice of you to knock.
-Orson.
-Mike.
That belong to me?
What'd he do
to our friend here?
You scared him to death, Mike.
It's good, sir.
Second mouse
always gets the cheese, mmm?
Yeah. Let's go.
The drive is good,
but it's scrambled.
Without the data key,
it's useless.
So our best option,
deliver the drive
and find out who the buyer is.
No one interesting
has joined the rooftop
in the last 40 minutes.
So whoever
you're there to meet
is already there.
Here we go. Nathan,
your file says you're terrible
at accents. So don't talk.
Bakker?
This for me?
Have a good evening.
Think I got him.
He's coming back
as Ben Harris.
Ben Harris.
He's the lawyer/consigliere
to Greg Simmonds.
Who's Greg Simmonds?
He's a billionaire
arms dealer.
-Only plays in the top tier.
-Greg Simmonds.
Interested in selling 9-mils
to kids. He's selling
Tomahawks to terrorists.
He's impossible to catch.
Very elusive.
He only uses Ben Harris
on his biggest deals.
And if he's turned up in person,
speaks for itself.
Oh, hello.
This might be useful.
Greg's hosting a charity event
in Cannes.
Well,
that's convenient, 'cause
we're also going to Cannes.
Seems he loves an orphan.
Well, he wants to.
He made enough of them.
Uh, we've picked up some time.
So we'll be arriving into LA
in less than four hours.
LA?
When I put my head down,
we were heading to
the south of France.
So, can someone please tell me
why we're flying to Los Angeles?
The power of "no," Nathan.
I'm sorry?
Backwards to go forwards.
We're going to LA
to pick up our invitation.
That being?
Danny Francesco.
Danny Francesco?
The movie star?
- Goddamn it!
- Stunt failed. Reset.
I do the stunts,
you shoot the money.
Wake up, everybody!
Chad, get out
of the fucking car!
Greg Simmonds's
favorite movie star,
Danny Francesco.
And how does that get us in?
You can't catch this fish
with conventional lures.
Greg wants
what everyone wants.
What they can't have.
There's nothing he can't buy
apart from Danny Francesco,
who recently snubbed
a ten-million-dollar offer
to jump out of a cake
and sing him "Happy Birthday."
He's obsessed
with celebrities, but more
obsessed with their partners.
Sarah will be going
as Danny's girlfriend.
It's the fish
that can't be caught, Nathan.
Power of "no."
And how do we turn
this movie star's "no"
into a "yes"?
I think we've got something.
Blackmail?
Yeah, blackmail.
Hmm. Ruse de guerre.
Very good. Carry on.
So, how are you
gonna play this?
I found
some spectacular dirt
on the infamous movie producer
Saul Goldstein,
so I pulled him in to help us.
I asked Saul to lure Danny
to Vegas
under the premise
of a five-picture deal.
But as Greg is hosting
his charity fundraising event
that we would like to attend,
you're going to ask
Danny Francesco
to come with us instead.
Huh. Creative work.
So what have we got
on Danny Francesco?
He's having an affair
with his sister-in-law.
Told you she was good.
Leave this with me.
Fucking Jesus.
Fucking Swedish.
You kill me, Saul!
Oh, Saul.
You're a fabulous producer.
I mean,
you're a piece of shit, but
you're a fabulous producer.
Everybody wants to
work with you.
I want to work with you.
But a Swedish accent, Saul?
Come on, I'm an American!
I can't do an accent.
Hello, Natasha.
Danny's not gonna
need you on this flight.
Uh, really?
Yeah. One of those things.
I appreciate that, Danny,
but we need you
to do this for us.
"For us"?
What, the royal "us"?
What are you talking about?
I mean, you have
to do this for us.
I have to?
I don't mean to
contradict you, Saul,
but I don't have to do
anything for anybody.
And I don't want to
contradict you, Danny,
but we all have to do our bit.
I'm sorry.
I thought you were here
to serve the coffee.
Why do I suddenly feel like
I'm being ganged up on here,
Saul?
-Who are you?
-I'm your new manager.
I'm sorry, kid.
They had something on me
too.
Okay, Saul,
where are you going? Saul--
I'm gonna let you converse
with your new manager.
You're gonna do great, Danny.
You're a star.
Saul. Hey, Saul.
-Where do you think
you're go-- This is--
-See you soon.
Saul,
don't you dare leave the--
Natasha!
Where is Natasha?
Who let this man
on my plane?
Natasha!
-This is my plane!
-Yes, it is, Danny,
and it's a lovely plane.
But you're gonna have to
trust me for two minutes.
-Why should I?
-Because you're an actor.
You're a movie star.
Because you're
a professional.
Imagine we're in a scene.
Please, sit down.
Are you a patriot?
I don't vote Republican,
if that's what you mean.
Okay. Let me give it to you
a different way.
The world needs you
for your greatest role yet.
You and I
are going to a party.
Who are you?
I'm your manager,
Charlie Rosewood.
You're no longer
going to Vegas.
We're going to Cannes.
No. You are getting off
of my plane,
and Natasha's
gonna make you.
Natasha! Natasha!
What the fuck
have you done with Natasha?
Please calm down.
There's a sensitive
and awkward situation between
you and your sister-in-law...
that you probably
shouldn't have filmed.
I actually love
my sister-in-law.
Yes, Danny. You've made that
quite evident.
It turns out everyone thinks
you're a superstar, Danny.
Once they heard
you were in town,
they came to us.
Uh--
Stop.
I don't think
I can do this.
No, no, no.
Danny.
Nope.
Danny.
Trust yourself.
No need to be nervous.
No reason to be nervous?
They're only killers.
We've all seen you
handle killers before
on-screen.
Fundamentally,
there's no difference.
What do you think
an agent does?
They act. And no one acts
better than you, Danny.
The best agents are stars,
and the best actors
are movie stars.
I guess that's sorta true.
You're an actor. Act.
There's a big difference
between an actor
and a movie star.
-And that is why
they're obsessed with you.
-Yeah.
Well, that and the fact that
I didn't jump out of a cake
for $10 million.
Okay.
While I'm busy playing
my part, what are you two
gonna be doing?
We need to get close enough
to Greg Simmonds
to remotely access his cell.
Okay.
I'm ready.
Let's go to work.
Walking on set.
Good.
Remember, you're not there
to buy anything.
I'm sure
I don't have to remind you
that you spent the entire
annual budget on wine
during the flight over.
So lay off the wine,
concentrate on getting
into Greg's phone,
and identify who's actually
buying this Handle.
Understood.
Danny, we good?
Good? Is that a joke?
Remember,
you're a professional.
You're playing yourself.
I-- But I've never
played myself.
You can do this.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Danny.
...lot number 4
from the Quintess Collection
is a pair of diamond
and sapphire earrings.
And a round of applause,
please, for Sir Jonathan Mendes
for the winning bid
of $258,000.
...happy ending because he--
he was diagnosed with, um--
What's that funny cancer?
Um...
Is there a funny cancer?
Can't remember what it was.
It was something
like cock cancer.
And he, uh-- He, uh...
-What?
-Will someone pinch me, please?
Pinch you? Why?
'Cause I think I'm dreaming.
Is that...
Is that Danny Francesco?
D'you know what?
I'm a little bit excited.
Oh, I do love
Danny Francesco.
Everyone loves
Danny Francesco.
I am a little bit starstruck.
I am. It's not cool, but I am.
Good evening.
Ah, good evening.
- Hi.
- Nah, I'll tell you what...
Danny, you like this--
Do you like this piece?
Love it.
It's one thing
utilizing the expense account
because you have
"psychological" issues.
It's another thing
bankrupting the department.
What's he doing here?
Was that you,
Benjamin Bunny?
Not guilty, Mr. Simmonds.
It was you, wasn't it?
It's a surprise, sir.
Ah, how much
is that fabulous item?
Lot number 15.
-$1.5 million.
-Ooh.
Lot number 15 from
the Habsburg collection.
You like it, Danny?
It's wonderful.
1.5 million, you say, eh?
Anything Danny buys,
he can pay for himself.
He can afford it.
He likes it.
Don't you fucking dare,
Orson.
-I'll take it.
-Orson!
Sadly, he can't.
It's no longer available.
-Shame.
-It's not a terrible shame.
It now belongs to you.
Compliments of Mr. Simmonds.
He's a big fan.
Mr. Danny Francesco.
Look at you.
The one and only,
the legend.
You're very kind.
No, no. I'm Greg Simmonds.
And I wanna thank you
very much
for all the entertainment
you've provided us
over the years.
-Thank you.
-Well, listen.
It's a fantastic gesture,
but I can't accept it.
No, no, you can,
and you can for two reasons.
One, you deserve it.
Two, it's a fundraiser.
Speaking of which,
would you care to meet
Trent and Arnold,
who are both in biotech?
I don't wanna be vulgar,
but 22 billion, 17 billion.
Sorry, boys, I didn't wanna
be indiscreet, but, you know,
facts are facts.
And they're both sponsoring
tonight's event.
Hey.
Big fan.
Oh, thank you. Great cause.
We try, you know.
Orphans. War.
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, oh, oh.
Let me introduce to you
the...
...the lovely Michaela.
Well, what
an absolute pleasure.
Pleasure's all mine.
And can I just say--
Are we allowed to
say these things now?
Wow. Wow.
- Wow.
- Wow.
Hello.
What's your name?
-Ah, Charlie Rosewood.
-Hello, Charlie.
My business manager,
Charlie Rosewood.
Oh, yeah? Are you sure?
You don't look like
a business manager.
Books, covers.
Oh, yeah.
Well, big book, aren't ya?
He's doubled my money
in the last three years.
Is that right?
You got any tips for me, then?
I don't think
you need any tips,
do you, Mr. Simmonds?
- You'd be surprised.
I'm very, very greedy.
Well, maybe tonight you'll be
loosening the purse strings
a bit for us.
Uh, no tax benefits,
so no chance.
And, uh,
Danny doesn't like kids.
Oh.
He was kidding.
Well, you're not wrong.
Actually, we've got two
of the war orphans
here tonight,
and they're really annoying.
I don't want to be pushy,
but there's a lot of
very interesting people
at this party,
and I would-- I'd--
Emilia, could you
take that for me, me darling?
I would love you
to meet some of them.
Well, I--
Mr. Simmonds,
I would love to.
I just--
I'm actually quite shy.
Danny,
it's the least you can do.
Mr. Simmonds here,
he just spent
1.5 million on you.
Well-- No. To be accurate,
I didn't spend it on Danny.
I spent it on Michaela.
Suggestion: Why don't we all
retire to the cocktail master?
That's what
you usually call me,
right, honey?
Minus the "tail."
She's--
I don't think I believe
what I just heard.
I'll pretend
I didn't hear that.
Come on, over to the bar.
You are gonna
wash your mouth out.
Come on, Danny.
A generous donation of...
So I grab him
by the balls...
Yeah, yeah.
...and I say,
"If you speak to her
like that again,
I'm gonna rip off your head
and shit down your neck."
And I feel something.
I feel a little lump.
Yeah.
Two days later, he's diagnosed
with testicle cancer.
Oh, my God.
A year later,
he wins his first
Tour de France.
- I love that.
- Yeah?
He's funny, isn't he?
And he's naughty too.
Yeah.
Yes.
Go on, then.
Give us some more.
-How are we gonna
get to his cell?
-His guard still has it.
We've been watching her.
Go find her.
One for the footman then.
Really?
Why can't you do it?
You wanted to be
more than a whiz kid.
You wanna get in the field,
get your shoes dirty.
Go on, everyone,
have another cocktail.
Keep him busy.
He cost a fortune.
Didn't you, Jean-Pierre?
Look at that.
Look at that! It's magic!
That's it.
Do all the monkey business.
That's it. Flip, flip.
I'll get yours, Michaela,
while you go to the powder room.
Oh, thank you so much.
It's not so much magic.
Just a little practice.
I could do that.
Give me ten minutes...
While I powder my nose,
what will you be doing,
Mr. Charlie Rosewood?
The waiter behind you was also
at the Madrid Airport.
Nathan, Mike's back again.
I heard.
You deal with Greg.
I'll handle Mike.
You do your thing,
and, uh, I'll do mine.
Okay, sweetheart.
Go on, then.
Give us some more.
Go back to the dirty ones,
'cause I like them best.
Well, this is gonna
knock your socks off.
Lot number 6
from the Delamont collection
is the one-of-a-kind
blue sapphire...
Where am I going?
Yes, thank you. I know.
Where is it?
Keep going and then
turn left at the end.
Evening, Nathan.
You got your boys in
to mess things up again?
Mike, nobody likes you,
even your wife.
Well, that's what
she told me, anyway,
whilst trying to
untangle herself
from my chest hairs.
One day
you'll grow up, Nathan,
and you'll realize
I've got more money,
more men, more intel.
You don't stand a chance.
In which department?
She did whisper you have
an alarmingly small penis,
and I know you have
an incredibly small brain.
Is it me
that should be worried?
You still running operations
out of the back of your garage?
At least I have an operation.
There's a difference between
you needing an operation
and me having an operation.
We're way ahead of you
on this, Nathan.
Outclassed as usual.
You'll only
mess this up like you do
all the others, Mike.
Stay out of my way.
Let's be
a good little buggy.
Okay, what do I do now?
Emilia's in the room
the other side of that wall.
I can get a lock
if you stand there.
If I get any closer,
my ass is gonna go through it.
JJ, who is this guy?
Hurry up 'cause I'm on him.
Okay, the phone's on now.
Can I help you?
Oh, hi.
I was just looking
at this painting.
Oh.
I'm sorry, who are you?
Michaela.
I'm here
with Danny Francesco.
That's it.
I, uh-- I saw you earlier.
Greg told me he had this
amazing painting, and he knows
I'm an art lover, so...
I actually curate
Mr. Simmonds's collection.
-No way.
-Yeah. This is actually
an original Rhed.
Wow. Rhed with an H.
Wow.
You really know your stuff.
That's pretty esoteric.
Do you work in the arts?
No, I'm just an enthusiast.
Keep him talking.
I'm always curious about
the philosophical details
behind
a collector's motivation.
Mmm. We delving
somewhere deep here?
I don't know. Are we?
All right, JJ.
I didn't need his life story.
I just wanted his name.
Now disconnect his comms.
Good evening, sir.
Vincent, is it?
Vincent, can I hear Orson?
Relax. Mike cannot
hear this conversation.
-Here you go, Mike.
You'll enjoy this.
-Vincent.
Vincent.
Who's Mike?
We can play that game
if you wanna,
but one way or another,
you're gonna
swim to the shore.
Vincent.
Please continue.
Well, I'm interested in...
...the paradox
of dualistic motivation.
He will try and bribe you.
Don't listen.
The only question is,
are you gonna do it
with a broken nose...
or with your face intact...
and this watch on your wrist.
The canvas should be a portal
into the abstract,
infinite, life-transcendent,
which, of course,
gives creative expression
its inner value.
Mike? Check in, Mi--
Fuck you, Orson.
Check in.
Where's the paradox?
The-- The paradox is that
there is beauty in the filth.
What else have you got?
Good question.
I admire a man
with a strong sense
of self-preservation.
However, there is a limit.
What was wrong
with the watch?
The most beautiful roses come
from the ugliest manure.
I feel like I'm on the couch.
You still got a minute to go.
Anyway, it's a theory.
I have no idea
if it has any credibility.
Where'd you get that from?
Have you got one for me?
Vincent.
One more chance...
while your nose
is still straight.
What's it in?
Left or the right?
It was the right.
Now, if you don't mind,
I'll take my watch back.
- Yes, Sarah.
- Good work. Wrap it up.
Rich people, if you,
um, hadn't noticed, they--
they like to show off.
I'm gonna head back.
Great chatting with you.
What's your name again?
Michaela. Mm-hmm.
Michaela.
Have a great night.
You too.
What's next
for Danny Francesco?
My next film role?
Yeah. Yeah.
Well,
I'm playing a mysterious,
self-made billionaire
who goes on a transcendental
journey from material genius
to spiritual giant.
Well, that's a bit spooky,
isn't it?
You just described me.
I don't--
Idea-- Danny, shush.
Idea: Why don't you come spend
a little bit of time with me
and, you know, do your research,
find your character, all that?
Charlie?
Michaela. Success?
Of course. Success?
Success.
Be with you shortly.
Well, I will go rescue
the movie star, then.
Good luck, Vincent.
Michaela, my darling,
your boyfriend
wants to use me,
don't know why,
as inspiration
for his next film.
Gave me an idea.
Why don't you both come
and have a little vacation
in my Turkish villa
this weekend?
-Ooh.
-And Danny gets to
pick up some tips.
Shadow me, you know.
Do whatever I do.
Whatever I do do.
What do I do?
We'll find out.
You will.
Is that a good idea?
I mean, I have
a couple things going on,
but I think
I can rearrange some things.
You, Michaela,
have a lot going on.
- But what about this weekend?
- Oh. Yeah.
Gregory, how are you?
Oh, Lord. Look who's here.
Well, we've been
waiting for you to introduce us
to Danny Francesco.
Of course you have.
Danny, I'd like you to meet
my very good friends
Alexander and Natalya,
and big Yiv...
Alexander.
...and the sulky Katya...
Yes.
...and somewhat scary Dimitry.
Dimitry,
nice to meet you.
Yes.
Man,
I'm such a fan, you know.
Uh, you mind if I, uh...
Selfie?
Yes.
Selfie time.
Let's do it.
Yeah. Be gentle with him.
Yes, um...
Go on, then.
Danny, please.
-Yes.
-This way. Yeah, good.
Wait. Wait, wait. Yes.
Yeah, good.
Good. Uh...
This is fantastic.
Okay. Everyone, just--
Yeah.
Why don't you just crowd
around a little tighter.
They're like piranhas,
aren't they?
Yeah.
Now, that is a feeding frenzy.
Another one. Whoa!
Okay.
Wait. Not finished yet.
No, I think we got it.
He's gonna come out of there
a skeleton.
Very, very nice to meet you.
Just watch where you're
putting your hands, Dimitry.
Why are you looking at me
like that, Greg?
I think you know
why I'm looking at you
like that.
And you know
that I'm spoken for.
Oh, I do,
and I respect that. I do.
But will you allow me
to flatter you for a moment?
Danny is a famous actor,
and that is very impressive.
But actors all work
for someone, don't they?
You strike me as someone
who doesn't take orders.
Well-- No.
 Shush, 'cause I'm talking.
I think you're a free spirit.
I'm not sure
what that means.
It's been a pleasure.
It's been an absolute--
You remember in this movie
when you were
a kick-ass bad guy?
You're so good.
I get some--
Come here.
The world is a much,
much bigger place
than you can possibly imagine.
Allow me to show it to you.
Eh?
Hmm?
Michaela.
Hello, Charlie.
Yes.
Does our superstar
need rescuing?
Great. Yes.
Hey, Danny. Shall we?
Michaela.
Mmm.
Think about
what I said, yeah?
Mmm.
Hey, look, Danny.
Your manager is here
to save you.
I gotta take him away
before you three birds
chew the meat off his bones.
-Danny, take my hand.
-Danny. Come on, please!
Oh!
Hey, Danny, stay! Come on!
- Hey, man. I love you.
- Danny, come back.
- We love you so much.
- Come on.
Danny, you're my man.
Man, I love you, man.
Look, these
beautiful pictures.
Ah, look.
Ha! Dimitry,
your tongue is hanging out,
and your hand
is on his cock.
Danny, you should be
proud of yourself.
Yeah, looks
like we may be going away
for the weekend with Greggy.
You guys have to stop
doing this to me.
I don't know if that was
the most exhilarating
moment of my life
or the most terrifying
moment of my life,
but Danny Francesco
playing Danny Francesco,
that is the way forward.
Congratulations, team.
A successful evening.
Debrief at 0700.
Good work.
Well, well, Greg.
Well, Alexander,
at your new, improved
summer sale price
that is the $10 billion...
we have a deal.
Fantastic!
So, who's buying?
No, not telling you that.
My job is to protect
every link in this chain.
So I do protect them, yes,
but I'm also protecting you.
So what happens now
is that I tell them
that you are delighted,
and they will be delighted,
and then we can all
be delighted together.
We should celebrate now.
We should. Uh, Emilia.
Get one of them really
stupid bottles of vodka.
You know, the one
with the five-carat rock
in the top.
You'll love that.
I do wish you'd communicate
with your other departments.
Someone is feeding Mike
information, inside information.
It doesn't
look like Mike is working for
anyone in this government.
I'll need more time
to find out which government
he's working for.
Now, tell me what you have.
We still can't confirm
it's the Handle.
What we do know
is that Alexander is selling
something for $10 billion.
Greg Simmonds
is brokering the deal.
And who's the buyer?
Still a mystery.
But it won't remain one
for long.
Well, I think
Orson is right.
Greg has a thing
for stealing girlfriends,
especially from movie stars.
So accept his offer
to go away.
That's a vulnerable
position.
I've dealt with much worse
than Greg Simmonds before,
believe me.
Vulnerable?
Just be aware if they need
to get out quick,
it might not be that easy.
At some point,
the movie star's gonna melt.
I'm sure he'll be fine.
What did you find
on Trent and Arnold?
Our biotech billionaires
are buying up
an awful lot of gold.
Other than that,
not a great deal.
At least we know
that Alexander and his friends
are involved.
Whatever they're selling
has now got Greg very excited.
Yeah. I found out
where they're staying,
but their computers
are impossible to hack.
I don't know how long
it's gonna take me to get in.
Options?
Quickest way
is to physically install
software on their computers.
You mean break in and
install via a thumb drive?
-Yes, that's the most
direct way to do it.
-This one's for you, then.
-Really? I thought
I was the footman.
-No, a tech whiz.
-Yeah, and you're the hammer.
-Hammer?
If there's a problem,
I'll do it.
No, there's not a problem, JJ.
I'll do it.
I can get
inside Alexander's.
I hope you take him
to dinner first.
Before you get
inside of him.
S... Se--
You are over the wall.
Neatly done.
And we are redirecting
the air con.
And they're all
sleeping like babies now.
They're not gonna
wake up anytime soon.
You are safe to enter.
Doors opening now.
Up the stairs, first floor,
bedroom on the left.
Once you've installed
the thumb drive,
cover your tracks
and make it look
like a robbery.
Swag some watches,
crack the safe
and bag some cash, baby.
The more you bag,
the better it looks.
No time to watch TV, sweetheart.
 Get to work.
Find the laptop?
Found.
And now I'd like you
to plug in that drive
and slap enter.
Whatever they control,
I can control better.
We have full access
to their computer.
Now that you've sucked it dry,
return to safe.
There are still
two guards patrolling.
Exit via the front door.
Nicely done, sweetheart.
We'll pick you up
at the front gate.
Don't move!
Don't--
What's that?
It's a guard dog.
Guard, dog.
-I'm good with a dog.
-Lucky, that.
-What about your mate?
-Power nap.
He'll be all right
in a minute.
Okay, are you guys done?
I heard a gunshot.
Shh. Shh.
-Is anyone dead?
-No.
No thanks to you.
-What?
-You said it was clear.
-I said the front was clear.
-I came out the front.
Yeah, you know, they usually
keep the Olympic-size
swimming pools
in the back of the house.
Ah.
Front, back, right, wrong.
Right, wrong.
Whatever.
Anyway, shall we?
- JJ.
- Sir.
Morning.
Morning.
Sarah says I didn't
miss much last night.
- In and out.
 -So you weren't seen by anyone?
-Yes.
-That's a yes,
you weren't seen by anyone?
-Yes.
-Or a yes,
you were seen by someone?
-Yes.
-Childish.
Nothing you need to
worry about, Nathan.
You just concentrate
on your gluten-free,
lactose-intolerant,
bunny-stroking breakfast.
Boys, done?
I pulled this off
of Alexander's laptop.
Looks like the deal's
all agreed to on their side,
and there's an escrow account
linked.
What are they selling?
We still don't know.
So we could be
wasting our time.
Hang on.
Activity on Greg's phone.
- Yes?
- Greg, you're on speaker.
I'm with Arnold, enjoying
the view from up here.
You're back in Disneyland already?
 Didn't hang about, did you?
What'd you do,
beam yourselves there?
Don't go mad, darling.
Yesterday I looked
like fucking candy.
You're lucky
we made your party at all.
- Your choice of friends is questionable.
- You're not wrong.
But I'd argue that they
are acquaintances, not friends.
And yes,
we did raise a lot of money
for the war orphans.
Thank you for caring.
Put a load of rich lowbrows
in a room together,
they'll always outbid
one another
in the name of
egotistical competition
and ostentation.
Which is kind of the point,
Trent.
Didn't have you down
as an angry anticapitalist.
No, we are anticapitalist.
Anti-other-capitalists.
I'll tell you what, boys.
I've got another call coming in.
Thank you, my darling.
Thank you, sir.
You better take it, then.
So what was the point
of this one?
Just to check we're okay.
Yes, we are okay.
Just remember,
yellow is the color
and gold is the game.
- And I still love you.
- We'll speak later.
Hello, Qasim.
Go on.
And? Everything set?
Why?
Don't move!
I will shoot you.
Don't shoot! Don't hurt me.
Come on. I-- Take my hands!
No police. No prison.
I've got kids!
Sir. Sorry, sir.
He's crying for mama.
Not a problem.
You shot my foot!
Shh!
No cry for mama.
Psst, psst, psst.
This is the kind of thing
I need to know about.
Shh. You dropped
your chopsticks.
You got shit on your face.
Should I be worried?
You keep me informed, Qasim.
Goody goody then.
"Flying fowl" in 72 hours?
What the cuss
does that mean?
I got a location
on Qasim's phone.
If Alexander and his team
are entering another country
illegally,
they're gonna need help
avoiding any risks
with the authorities.
So where's this Qasim based?
Antalya, Turkey.
Gobble, gobble.
That's "flying fowl"
with a W, not a U.
Hence "flying fowl,"
flying to Turkey.
Bit of a reach.
You'd think so,
except Qasim Amari
is a diplomat
located in the, uh,
Turkish government's office
in Antalya, Turkey.
I don't know how I do it.
What a brain.
Do I have a brain in there?
Oh, she does.
Modern women.
What will they think of next?
- So, looks like
we're all flying fowl.
- Amazing.
We'll track Qasim,
see where he leads us.
Sarah, you go with Danny
as planned
and find out from Greg
exactly what it is
he's buying.
We need a confirmation
on that.
Explains why Greggy's spending
his weekend in Turkey.
There's a term
for being beaten
in four moves, Nathan:
-Fool's Mate.
-Wasn't four moves.
If you can get yourself
out of that little mess
I put you in,
you can have a glass of this.
What we got on Qasim, JJ?
Libyan diplomat based
all over the world.
Met Greg Simmonds
in the 2000s, who put him
on the payroll soon after.
Qasim's been greasing palms
and burying bodies for Greg
ever since.
Nice work.
Have a glass of this.
Wine's not really my thing.
Is that the 2004?
Who's talking to you?
Aren't you busy enough?
There's wine
and then there's wine.
Don't force the poor man.
Whoo!
Congratulations,
Dr. Frankenstein.
You've created
another monster.
Nathan, you don't put
fish fat oil in a Ferrari.
Whoo!
Ah, little Miss Paradox.
She got in your head yet?
-Hey, good to see ya.
-You too.
There they are,
my new best friends.
Hosgeldiniz,
as we say in Turkey.
Mmm. Thank you
for the jet.
Oh, don't be silly.
That's the baby one.
-Danny Francesco, yeah.
-It's good to see you, Greg.
Excited to be here,
learn from the master.
Oh, no, I'm not the master.
Now, before
we do anything else,
follow me
'cause I have something
to show you.
Grab a drink on the way.
'75 Corniche, Greggy.
I love it.
Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?
Present from Elton, that one.
Wait a second.
That looks exactly like
the car that I drove--
Do you know why?
Do you know why?
- That's not possible.
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, it is.
Lovingly restored
with me own hands.
It's not really
with me own hands.
I'm just joking.
- It's nice though, isn't it?
- I--
Look at him.
I drove this car myself.
I know, honey.
And, Michaela,
did his own stunts.
Is that true, Danny?
Yeah.
-Could you still do 'em?
-I'm a little rusty, but sure.
Right, game on.
After lunch, yes?
Okay. I might have to
sit that one out,
but you boys have fun.
After lunch, Michaela,
you are having the pleasure
of a four-hands,
hot stones massage
with Suki and Sasha.
And they really,
really understand
a lady's geography.
Isn't that right, Emilia?
Yes, they do.
Sounds fabulous.
She looks nervous.
Oh, believe me, I'm not.
You even have my prop gun!
Yeah, yeah, it is.
But it's not a prop anymore,
Danny, so steady, yeah?
I cannot believe
you got this car.
Yeah.
I wanted this car
so bad.
Did you? Did you?
How much did you want it,
Danny?
Of all the cars
I've driven on-screen,
this is the only car
I wanted to possess.
-Is that right?
Did you crave it?
-Yeah.
-Did you yearn for it?
-Yeah.
Did you dream about it?
I longed for it.
Do you know what?
It's yours.
Come on, let's have lunch.
-What?
-It's yours.
Come on!
All right.
Do you like kebabs?
What's in the bag?
Nothing.
So you're carrying
an empty bag?
You nicked the Margaux,
didn't ya?
"Nicked"
is a little bit strong.
Leaving half a bottle
of Margaux on a plane?
So you're
a doggie bag man.
Do you have any idea
what it costs?
He has no idea
how much it costs.
Short arms, long pockets.
Room keys.
Meet down here
in 60 minutes?
We're off
to track the Libyan.
-What are you doing?
That's my key.
-I know what it is.
I also know
you've given yourself
the biggest room.
How do you know I haven't
already switched them?
Fuck off, Nathan.
You haven't got
the bandwidth for that.
I can't believe it.
I'm in the car with the actor.
Is the back end still bulletproof?
 It feels a little squirrelly.
Oh, yeah.
Unique selling point.
So, tell me, how did
the leap from millionaire
to billionaire change you?
Right. Interesting question
and, I imagine,
my cue to say money
doesn't make you happier.
I'll tell you what, Danny,
it fucking does.
It does.
I'm really happy now and--
and a nicer person too.
I worry about things.
I worry about the world.
I worry about
the war orphans.
You don't strike me
as a worrier, Greg.
Yeah, well,
you don't strike me
as someone who drives like
a little girlie, but you do.
Oh, is that how it is?
Whoa!
Slow down,
Danny Francesco.
You are driving me
into my dreams!
Everything all right,
Michaela?
Yeah. Oh, my God,
this place is massive.
And wow,
this piece is beautiful.
Um, Mimar Sinan.
-Are you looking for your room?
-Yes.
Mm-hmm.
My room is that way.
It's actually the other way.
Of course.
Down the corridor,
turn right,
and it's on your left.
Hey, that massage
was so good, by the way.
-Y-You should join us next time.
-Turn right.
Right. Got it.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Qasim's out.
We following?
Not yet.
Looks like he's en route
for a coffee.
Oh, hello.
How does he do it?
Mike?
Doesn't matter
how he's done it. He's done it.
-It's Mike, isn't it?
-How's he getting
his information?
Ground control?
- Can you hear me, Major Tom?
- Loud and clear.
How are we getting on?
Looping monitor.
They have some sort
of adolescent firewall.
It's taking me about a minute
to perforate it.
Done.
Looks like he's had enough
of that paper.
Qasim's off,
and Mike's going with him.
We following?
No, let Mike play that game.
My money's on the paper.
Whatever you say, boss.
You want an ice cream?
And I am in.
Great.
What's he buying?
Hold on.
I picked up a file
sent by Qasim.
He's using RSA encryption.
Huh.
- Well, that's disappointing.
- What?
Well, it looks like
Greg's up to no good.
But not spectacularly no good,
just no good.
Don't be mean, Sarah.
Give me something.
Greg is buying containers
of stolen AK-47s.
Yes, very funny.
Now, seriously, what is it?
No, I am serious.
We've got it wrong.
See for yourself.
Oh, hello.
We've seen him before.
Shall we?
I'll get the ice creams,
you get the wheel.
Can't be, Sarah.
All that fuss over
30 million dollars'
worth of guns?
It's too small a crime
for too big a player.
If it's a cover,
it's a very good one.
It's enough evidence to feel
his collar, but not enough
to choke him with it.
Understood,
but there's nothing linking
this deal to the Handle.
Pooh. Get out of there
and get back as soon as you can.
Let me just dig a bit deeper
and find some evidence
we can hold over him
for a rainy day.
Okay, but be quick.
- Orson, you there?
- What is it?
Time to come in.
We were wrong.
It's not the Handle,
it's firearms. We're following
the wrong rabbit.
You go back to bed.
Leave this with me.
Sarah's shown me proof.
Forget it. We're done.
I don't think so.
We're back with
our old friend Ben Harris.
If Greg has Ben involved,
there's no way that this deal
is about guns.
All right.
Follow him, but do not engage.
I'll let Sarah know
we're still in play.
You got me, JJ?
I've got a lock on you, boss.
Do we pick him up?
No.
Cat follows mouse.
Can you get a lock
onto his phone?
Yeah, if you get close enough.
Stay within 50 meters.
I can use your phone
to lock onto his signal.
Quicker if he uses it.
Get close enough
to raise suspicion,
but not too close so he bolts.
That will initiate him
activating his phone.
Are we being followed?
He sent a text.
I blocked it.
I've got him. I've locked on.
I've blocked his call.
Can't get through.
No signal.
Deal with that.
Yes, sir.
Lost?
Thank you, sir.
Maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for
the, uh, harbor.
This way, sir.
Oh.
Hang on. I've just
jammed another message.
We're burned.
He's recognized ya.
That's strange,
'cause, uh,
according to the map,
it says this way.
No. This way, sir.
Oh.
Ah! Amazing.
You're absolutely right.
Thank you.
Got to pick him up.
He's gonna run.
Orson, if he gets out of range, I can't block his signal.
 Get after him.
He's in the building
on the left.
He's ten meters, straight on.
Hey!
JJ, he's on two wheels.
Talk to me.
Fifteen meters, take a right.
Left or right, JJ?
Sharp left.
He's getting out of range.
- JJ, speak to me.
- He's stopped moving.
He's right in front of ya.
Missed him.
- Stairs?
- Take a right.
Afternoon.
Excuse me.
Can you, uh, take a picture
of me and the view?
They're only stairs.
Go on, move yourself.
Next time,
I'll sit in the car.
You do the chasing.
Let me take a look.
Oh, beautiful.
Give me your phone.
Let me take one of you.
He's still there.
There's no one here.
I'm telling ya,
he's right there.
You're on top
of his phone now.
Ah, Jesus.
What did he do that for?
Hold on,
I'm just pulling up.
There's a body all over the floor 200 feet below me.
 It's Harris.
Get the phone, the paper...
...and get the body
in the back.
That isn't Ben Harris.
What do you mean
it's not Ben Harris?
That's Ben Harris.
Is he in the back?
Yeah, he's in the back.
So, Nathan, can you now confirm?
The file Sarah extracted
from Greg's computer
was actually the data key
that unlocked the Bakker drive,
confirming it is the Handle.
So what is it?
The first of its kind
programmable AI.
Our people had hoped
it was still in the post,
but now it seems
the post has been delivered.
It can hack any system,
even other AI programs.
- With what end?
- To any end.
It can launch a nuclear strike
and then cover its own tracks,
pointing the finger
at whomever it wants to blame.
Whatever is run by a computer,
it can control.
And we still don't know
what they intend
to use it for.
Yes.
But we can at least
now confirm
that Alexander is indeed
selling the Handle,
with Greg Simmonds
brokering the deal
for $10 billion.
Confirmed.
So, what now?
When's the transaction
gonna take place?
Deal's set for 9:00 a.m.
Between the newspaper
and info extracted
from his phone,
Ben Harris was to be picked up
from Hotel Amara's lobby
by Alexander's representative
and taken to the exchange
to transfer the escrow.
He still needs to call Greg
to get a 15-digit passcode.
So, inconveniently,
we do still need Ben Harris.
Could've done
without him dying, but still.
Childish.
Can we make me Ben Harris?
Go on.
They don't know
what he looks like.
He guarded his visual identity
very closely.
Mr. Harris?
Yes.
There is a green
G-Wagon outside.
My men will escort you.
I'll do the deal myself.
But you'll have to talk
to Greg on the phone.
It's a pleasure
to meet with you,
Mr. Harris.
Your phone, please.
Anything else?
Nothing else.
Do you mind?
Please.
I can make you look like him,
but I can't make you
sound like him.
Don't we know someone
who can?
I'll tell you what,
Danny, Michaela.
It's a gift.
It is a gift. My dad had it.
It's like a party trick
for him.
Didn't matter what it was.
Could be a toy,
could be a pair of shoes.
He could put his hand on it,
shut his eyes
and tell you the price.
He'd go, "14.99."
No, he could. He could. You--
Don't stop on my account.
I have to use
the little girls' room.
Yes, my darling.
You know where it is,
don't you?
Uh, yes. It's, uh,
straight past Mimar Sinan
and a right at Timur.
She's funny, isn't she?
She's great.
You're very lucky.
Right. So, roof comes down.
Watch this. Roof comes down.
You say,
"Relax. Relax, Mr. Steak."
There he is all calm now.
Sarah, regrettably,
Ben Harris has passed away.
When?
Couple of hours ago.
Orson encouraged him to jump off
an extremely tall building.
Mmm. Poor guy.
Can you make him
sound like Harris?
-Have you sourced
any existing voice recordings?
-Yes.
In which case,
upload them and send them to me,
and I can do that.
How?
The vocoder works
in real time.
Mmm. Clever.
That's AI for you,
Nathan.
One last thing.
I need you to confirm
you still have full access
to Alexander's network.
Confirmed.
Make yourself comfortable.
There is water in the door.
- So far, so good.
- Okay.
Keep in touch, JJ.
Now, you two, you're gonna
have to entertain yourselves
for an hour,
'cause I've gotta
make a work call.
It's all right.
I guess I could use a little
nappy-poo myself, so...
-Ooh. I'll join you
for your nappy-poo.
-Yeah?
Change of plan.
Danny, you make the work call.
I'll take the nappy-poo.
Michaela, you join me.
Greggy.
They're going off road.
I'm parking up.
He is the real deal.
It's super impressive.
- And he's so into you!
- You really know your stuff.
I mean,
if you're not interested,
I know I might be.
Fill your boots.
Where's the paradox?
What are you doing?
-Well, I need to make Orson
sound like Greg's lawyer.
-Why?
Because Ben Harris is dead,
and we need him alive
for the arms deal.
Ben Harris is dead?
When did that happen?
And who killed him?
That's not something
you need to worry about,
Danny.
You need to worry about
how much longer we have
until we're found out.
Found out?
I know you're having
a billionaire love affair.
It's very sweet.
But we have about 20 minutes
before Greg's security
blows our fucking brains out.
What do I do?
I suggest you get ready
for your next scene.
-Which is?
-The getaway.
Right. I know
how to do that.
-Action time.
-Right.
I'll see you in the garage.
- Okay, darling.
They will be here soon.
I'm on.
Sergi.
Boss.
I'm in place.
Mr. Harris, I assume.
Pleasure to meet you.
Likewise.
Here we are.
Your people have confirmed
our product is authentic.
I present the Handle.
I need my phone.
Yes, Benjamin Bunny?
Mr. Simmonds, we're connected.
Mr. Simmonds, we're connected.
All right.
We're good.
The 15-digit passcode.
A moment of privacy, please.
A moment of privacy, please.
Emilia.
What is it?
There seems to be
some sort of break-in
in our Internet security.
Just waiting
for the system to go online.
Just waiting
for the system to go online.
Holding.
It's like someone's
hacked in, but it keeps
dropping in and out.
Who's hacking in?
The signal's coming
from within the compound.
Ready for
the 15-digit passcode.
Ready for the 15-digit passcode.
Right, here we go.
Two, six, two...
Harris is
transferring now. Stand by.
Update.
It's happening.
Check the monitors.
Show me where.
The signal's bouncing
all around the server.
I can't lock it down.
...squiggly dash, eight...
Come on.
...five, nine,
small letter "b"
for bollocks...
...five, six,
five, five, comma,
big "C" for clit.
It happened.
Ponytail, 11 o'clock.
Show me Greg's office.
I know Greg's in there.
Why is it empty?
- Got it?
- All done.
- Transaction complete.
- All right, Ben.
You hurry home.
Don't talk to strangers.
Check all communications
in and out of the villa
in the past 24 hours.
Doesn't like ya.
It's the guard from the villa.
I'm on him.
Payment confirmed.
Ten billion confirmed.
Confirmed.
Mazel tov.
Confirmed.
Ponytail,
lodging complaint.
- Thank you, Mr. Harris.
- Stop!
This is not Ben Harris.
Kill him!
JJ.
Sarah, update.
I'm just unconfirming
their confirmation.
-What's happening?
-It was confirmed.
Just confirm again!
JJ, who are these people?
I'm scanning.
Find out.
- Give me a moment.
- Thirty seconds.
I don't understand.
What don't you understand?
It's gone.
Just don't tell me it's Mike.
Understood. Then I won't.
-Who is it?
-I'm not allowed to tell ya.
Fuck it!
Give me a fucking break.
I got Orson under control.
Get that gun out of my face.
Give me the fucking radio.
Are you up there
in the chopper, Mike?
Orson, you sound upset.
Don't you worry
about me, Mike.
I'm having a lovely time.
What seems to be the problem?
Engine trouble?
Don't concern yourself.
I'll give you
the bus fare home.
My boys
will take over from here.
Come on.
Who are ya?
Who are you, Michaela?
How'd you do it?
This thing between us...
is strong, innit?
Do you know
what the Turks call it?
It means "fire."
They say the gods
will be furious
if you put it out.
But you know
what I'm gonna do?
I'm going to put it out,
Michaela, because of Danny.
He's a friend,
and I respect him.
And it's the right thing
to do.
Mmm.
I'm sorry
if that disappoints you.
- No, it's fine.
- I'll see you at dinner.
Round up any survivors.
Tie 'em up, beat 'em up,
bring 'em here.
I wanna be
back in the air ASAP.
Orson,
you know why I'm here.
Let's not
make this any messier
than it needs to be.
So don't be a bad girl.
Just surrender my prize.
You want it so bad,
you get your arse down here
and get it yourself.
I have people
to do that for me.
Oh, here he is.
Keeping a safe distance
as usual.
You're a spineless jellyfish,
Mike.
- Yatom, get the case.
- I'm on it.
Go on. It's yours.
You're not taking it.
I'm giving it to ya.
Okay. What's this?
Oh, no. He's got a gun.
It's okay, relax. Relax.
Oh, it's a selfie! Okay!
Who's gonna tell me
what's going on?
We think they hacked
into our secure server.
It's not that secure,
then, is it?
It's worse than that,
I'm afraid.
Whoever you think you were
on the phone to before,
you weren't.
Ready for
the 15-digit passcode.
What are you on about?
That's Ben.
Ready for
the 15-digit passcode.
You stop Danny Francesco
and whoever the fuck that is.
Do it now. Do it now!
Get after that car.
Bring them back to me.
Understood.
Yatom, we good?
Yes. We got it.
Check the case, John.
You have the case.
So why are we on our knees?
You won't be on your knees
for long, my friend.
Orson,
there's something strange
going on up here.
-It's good, boss.
-Right.
Temperature's changed.
Mike's gone rogue.
He's executed Alexander's men.
We've got what we need.
Connors.
Yes, boss?
Kill Orson.
They're gonna kill you now.
Shoot them first, then.
I'm not just good with dogs.
Tidy.
There's a chopper
with a dead pilot up here.
I'll meet you there.
Incoming.
Nathan.
Yes?
Nathan, we're being chased
by Greg's security.
Then get un-chased.
Good news,
the back is bulletproof.
Bad news,
I can't control the back end.
You any good
in one of these?
It's been a while.
But I'll feel my way.
It's only a chopper.
Feeling my way.
You think you can
put your foot down?
What are you gonna do
with that?
I'm gonna shoot at them,
Danny.
I think I can
help you out with that.
I'm out of bullets.
Nathan, are you there?
Yes, what is it?
Your friend Mike's
appeared again,
but this time he's turned.
-Turned?
-He's executed Alexander's men
and taken the AI.
I'm going after him
in a chopper.
Did the other two
get out okay?
Don't worry about them.
They can take care
of themselves.
The road's closed.
- What happened?
- Cover's blown.
Greg's security
are in pursuit.
You just focus
on retrieving the case
from Mike.
Find out where they are.
Already on it.
Two minutes southwest
of this thing.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
They're going in the tunnel.
Do you know how to use
these rocket launchers?
Can't be too complicated.
F for "forward,"
R for "rocket."
Oh, I think
we're in trouble here.
Oops.
I think R's for "rear."
I think
I've worked that out now.
Thank you, JJ.
Let's hope
there's two more seats
in that chopper.
Knighton has confirmed
Mike was not working
for any government.
He's been working
independently.
Ain't that a surprise.
You need to track him down.
You track him down.
We're going back to Greg's.
-We are?
-You are?
We are?
We are?
I can't go back to Greg's.
Danny, nothing
to worry about.
JJ's taking care of you.
Sit down, Danny.
You might wanna see Greg,
but I don't think Greg
wants to see you.
That's where you're wrong,
Nathan. I am exactly
who he wants to see.
He knows Sarah downloaded
enough information on him
to throw away the key.
...find some evidence
we can hold over him
for a rainy day.
- So, Greg now works for us.
- Clever me.
I'm just gonna say it.
JJ, tell Greg
we're coming in.
We have an offer
he can't refuse.
We'll be expecting a call.
Whatever you say, boss.
Uh, can we--
can we drop me off first?
Nothing to worry about, Danny.
Greg's in love with you.
Would you buckle up?
Sit down, Danny.
Well, if you're wondering
whether I'm feeling
something of a tit,
the answer is yes, I am.
-Is it humiliating, Emilia?
-Yes.
Do we still think
we can maybe make a deal?
Yes.
Yes, we do.
Which is not to take away
from the genius of your plan,
Orson Fortune.
That is a sexy name.
It is.
You must fancy him a bit,
fake Michaela.
Still fancy you a bit.
But what you done,
using him as bait,
celebrity Trojan horse,
that's brilliant.
It's classy.
Not so classy, though,
is your competitor Mike.
Comes barreling in,
pretending to be
Mr. Law and Order,
steals your thunder and,
potentially, my commission.
You can keep
your commission, Gregory.
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
You can keep your commission,
you can keep your reputation,
your liberty.
Because you're gonna donate
your said commission
to your favorite charity,
Orphans of War.
Oh. Am I?
Who's your buyer, Greg?
I never reveal my buyers,
Orson.
Emilia, tell them.
You remember
Trent and Arnold?
...would you care to meet
Trent and Arnold...
- The biotech billionaire friends.
-  That's it.
As we speak, they are using
your precious programmable AI,
the Handle,
I believe you call it,
in conjunction
with a concert of satellites.
...enjoying the view
from up here.
Purpose: To trip up
the world's banking system.
So that's why they're
buying up 40 billion dollars'
worth of gold
while simultaneously trying
to cover their tracks.
That's exactly it, Orson.
By the time they finish,
gold is the only thing
you'll be able to buy
a sticky book with.
You're taking us there, Greg.
I could.
And I reckon
I can get through the door
because I've got something
they can't ignore.
Namely, a comprehensive
insurance policy.
But I do worry about
your invitation.
Trent and Arnold
have rented themselves
a very nasty
little private army.
You let me worry about that.
Just one last thing.
I would kill
to see you in action.
Oh, Danny.
Well, how can I say no?
So, what are they going to do
with this Handle?
The Handle...
would be
a financial atomic bomb.
It'll create a digital glitch
in the world's banking system.
May last only a few minutes,
but that'll be enough
for trust to evaporate
in conventional markets.
Gold, like always,
would be the only
remaining currency
with any credibility,
its value
rising exponentially.
Anarchy would follow
while the world
reorganizes itself.
Well, Nathan,
now it's time for your man
to prove his worth.
Clear the room.
Anita.
Yes, Mr. Knighton.
Get the PM on the line.
And the bird is up.
We'll have eyes soon.
And Greg and Danny
have arrived.
Floor is yours.
Method?
Blitzkrieg.
Hmm.
Get 'em before
they count the first body.
I like it.
I'll cover ya.
There are blind spots.
That's what the bird's for,
JJ.
JJ...
shoot straight.
Leave it with me, boss.
How are you feeling?
Good.
Nervous?
No.
Remember your lines.
You've only got two.
You got the bit
about the lights?
Yes.
One more thing, Danny.
Lose the shades.
And we are back
with four guards
by the pagoda.
I am blocking their comms.
Blocked.
I have the two on the right.
Hello, boys. Hello.
Ooh, a lot of very
serious faces, Danny.
Now, you remember those two,
don't you? Trent and Arnold.
And one of you, you,
is Mike. Is that right?
Well played, Mike.
A bit naughty
for a government contractor,
but we are where we are.
Moving on.
Two more ahead.
I'll take one o'clock.
The purpose
of this visit is, Danny?
You never paid, uh...
Mr. Simmonds's commission.
We were paying
for you to deliver,
but you didn't.
Mike did. You failed.
That's a bit weak,
isn't it, Trent? Because
I wasn't paid to deliver.
I was paid to supply,
and I think I have supplied.
Have I, Danny?
Orson, take a left
through the hedges.
Two on the jetty.
Now you're clear.
Do we really
have to listen to this?
You will listen to this,
and here's the reason.
I don't wanna patronize you.
I'm not a patronizing person.
But you three,
one, two, three,
you are quite new
to this game, aren't you?
And there is a reason
why no one,
and I do mean no one,
not Mr. Hussein,
not Mr. Qaddafi,
not Mr. Escobar--
and that's before
I start dropping names...
...why none of them
have ever refused to pay me.
Have you got me?
Going dark.
Repositioning.
Let me find you.
In the Can-Am.
Behind me, on the horizon,
I think you'll see an old,
derelict, 1960s hotel.
Needs demolition.
Now, you could do that with...
I don't know, what,
30, 40 pounds of Semtex.
About right, Mike?
Silence
and darkness retained.
And you've got
two more guards up top.
Or you could do it with...
Lights, please, Danny.
One AGM-65 Maverick missile
very much like this one
in three, two, one.
What happened there then?
Let's do that again.
In three, two, one.
Wait. Wait. Wait.
There's more.
There we are.
I think we're done now.
Danny, the lights again,
please.
What are you trying to convey
with this... illustration,
Mr. Simmonds?
What I'm trying to convey,
Mike, is how little
you boys understand
of the new world
which you find yourselves in.
I would've thought
it was obvious
that I'd have some kind
of insurance, and I do.
Danny, give them the papers.
You'll see
in the left-hand column
there's a list
of names and addresses
of people that I believe
you hold near and dear.
Take the service elevator
one level down.
And he's in. Phase two.
Let's move.
In the right-hand column,
there's a very exact time
for when those people
will be, um...
What's a nice word for it,
Danny?
Uh, "eviscerated."
That's not
a very nice word, is it?
But it's not gonna happen,
because I'm very confident
that within five minutes,
and five minutes is all you have
as the countdown has started,
and the only thing
that will stop it...
...is a phone call
from my business manager...
telling me that my money
has been transferred
to my account.
So from this point,
it's out of my hands
and into yours.
Danny, let's go
and have a drink. Come on.
Bye, boys.
I mean,
give him the money.
Mike. That's my mom there.
Jean.
That's the most
impressive thing
I've ever seen a man do.
Really? Really?
Get the transfer done now.
-We were set up
to make the payment anyway.
-So get it done now!
He's bluffing.
Those explosions didn't
look like a bluff to me!
Turns out there's a reason
they call him the Dark Angel
of Merciless Death, Mike!
Listen to me.
He's bluffing.
Easy for you to say.
I mean, do you even have
anyone on your list?
You can forget your commission, Mike.
 It's going to Simmonds.
You useless
pair of Silicon tits.
Let me handle this.
Back off! All right?
You handling it
put us in this mess.
I'm not interested
in what you have to say, Mike.
Now back the fuck off!
Backing off.
Backing off.
Everybody calm down.
Calm down.
Mike looks upset.
-Orson, how you doing?
-Still alive.
Still moving upwards.
Okay, well, Greg left
with the movie star.
It seems like things
are getting a bit heated
in there.
Chris, progress report.
It's happening, it's happening.
Thirty seconds.
They're doing
the transferring now.
That's a billion dollars
to your Orphans of War.
Look, we'll be okay.
We won't be okay.
Did you see
what happened out there?
You think that's okay?
I am in their system.
I have all their
codes and details.
I can move all their money.
Truth is
I am better than them,
and you don't need them
anymore.
...idea to get
involved with the fucking
weapons dealers--
Don't turn this around on me.
We have a problem,
and we have to deal with it.
-There are explosions going off
on the fucking horizon.
-Oh, are there?
You think that's fu--
So, you're just gonna
brush that off?
No, no. No. No!
Is it safe to go in?
It's hard to tell,
but there is nobody moving.
Bit of a mess in here,
whiz kid.
Found the case, JJ.
Just check it.
We're good, boss.
Orson, behind you.
In three, two, one.
Don't do it, Mike.
Leave it where it lies.
Orson, I need the case.
I need the fucking case!
You want it so bad, Mike,
you can fucking have it.
Orson!
What you got in the case?
Our wages.
Is that Nathan and his army
to get us out of here?
That's not Nathan
you can hear.
That's Knighton's
black ops incoming,
a little bit late as usual.
Nathan abandoned us.
Apparently, he has something
more important to do.
Of course he did.
He sent the BBJ.
He's in Doha. Apparently,
there's been another incident.
Oh, but he told me
to tell you not to panic.
He has all of your
medicinal requirements
on board.
Did you bring a corkscrew?
I'll be your corkscrew, baby.
Course you will.
Budge up.
We're going on a holiday.
I suppose you're all feeling
quite pleased with yourselves.
It's impossible to feel
pleased with ourselves
on the wages you pay.
I have some good news.
Since your last escapade
was such a success,
don't let it go to your heads,
I have another job for you.
And this time,
the money is spectacular.
I don't care
how spectacular it is.
I'm going on holiday.
That's yours.
Ooh, where are we going,
darling?
Don't know,
and I don't care.
As long as it's hot,
expensive, and he's paying.
And we're taking the jet.
Take it, take it.
Go wherever you want.
Go mad.
Enjoy the snow,
enjoy the beaches.
It's all on me, as long
as you're back in 36 hours.
Two weeks.
Orson.
I'm not great at skiing.
Orson.
I like the beach.
I don't care where we go
as long as I'm drunk.
-Fine. 48 hours.
-Ten days.
You're killing me!
Ninety-six hours!
A week.
And, Orson, we need
the necklaces and watches
you stole from Alexander.
Your government
wants them back.
Too late. I've sold 'em.
I've invested the money.
We are now
in the movie business.
See you next Tuesday.
Hold on.
Orson. Wait.
W-What movie business?
It better not involve
Danny Francesco
and his fiancé, Greg Simmonds.
We were paying to deliver,
but you didn't.
Mike did. You failed.
Yeah, well, that's
a bit naughty, Mr. Yamamoto.
I'm not paid to deliver.
I'm paid to supply.
Now, there's a very
good reason why no one...
...and I mean no one,
not Mr. Hussein,
not Mr. Qaddafi,
not Mr. Escobar--
and that's before
I start dropping names...
Behind me on the horizon,
there's a derelict monastery
in need of demolition.
Now, how are we going
to do that?
Well, we could use
50, 60 pounds of Semtex.
Does that sound about right,
Mr. Yamamoto?
Or we could use one single
AMG-65 Maverick missile,
very much like this.
Going in three, two, one.
Fucking amateur hour. Maxie.
- Where's the VFX, Maxie?
- Sorry, Danny.
Come on, man.
I can't work like this.
I'll get it fixed.
- Barney, can you get me Guy?
- Cut the camera.
Cut the cameras.
Reset, everybody.
What did you think
of that one, Greggy?
I'll be honest with you.
For me,
that was very, very moving.
That was--
That was beautiful, Danny.
