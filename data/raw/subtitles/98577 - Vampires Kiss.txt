Poured myself a coffee.
I kept telling myself, you know,
"I'll wake her up after I do this
or, uh... this little step."
Now, that's not true, really.
I knew I was going to delay
waking her up for as long as possible.
WOMAN: What was it you really wanted?
I wanted her, same as always,
I wanted her to disappear.
I wanted her to be
the hell out of there.
(CHUCKLES)
And she got the hell out of there.
She took the hint. She woke up,
you were fully dressed,
ready to go to work.
More or less, yeah, she took the hint.
And yet just the night before,
you wanted her very badly, hmm?
Yeah.
I know. Really badly.

He can stretch himself from here

- We said him already.
- No, no, no. The rubber man.
He's the last of the Fantastic Four
we've been searching for all these days.
- The missing link. Yes?
- No, we already said him.
- Oh, look, there's a taxi. Taxi!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

(TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING)
Alva. Alva!
Yes, Mr. Loew?
All right, uh... Frank Heatherton
wants a copy
of the first contract he had
for the sale of his short story...
...uh... "Rattlesnake Hills."
"Der Spiegel".
Seems that the first
foreign sale he's ever had
and suddenly he wants
to frame the agreement.
Now, the story was sold in 1963,
and I know that's a long time
before either I was here
or you were here.
But there is no reason why the agency
shouldn't have a copy of it.
I already looked in the files
under "Heatherton,"
I looked under "Rattlesnake Hills,"
but I am asking you
to go through the entire
"Der Spiegel" file,
because that is a very fat file
and nothing is in order
and it will take hours,
but it will be there...
somewhere.
Please find it and bring it to me.
Yes, Mr. Loew.

something that wasn't even
halfway attainable.
Peter?
Well, I guess my time's up.
No, no, no,
we have a couple more minutes.
(CLOCK CHIMING)
You know, uh... lately...
you have always been telling me
when our time is up.
And I just wonder if maybe...
does it make you feel
a little insecure when I say...
- (LAUGHS)
- Well, what?
Nothing. Nothing, it's, uh...
I was remembering.
I brought this girl
up to my place the other night.
Really hot, you know?
And we're on the bed.
Suddenly, this bat
comes swooping down out of nowhere.
- A bat?
- Holy shit.
But this... this really happened,
but the part...
this part I don't know if this
really happened or I dreamt it later
or what. I mean,
I'm fighting this bat off all alone
and I'll be damned if I didn't get...
really turned on.
- You were aroused?
- Yeah.
But you said just a few seconds before,
you were in the throes of passion.
- Yeah, I know.
- So then you were aroused.
- With the girl?
- Yes, with the girl.
Oh, sure. Yes. Absolutely,
but then she left the room and I was...
I mean... I came down. You know?
I was in mortal combat
with a fucking bat.
- Give me a break.
- Wait.
You were fighting off the bat
and that's when
you had this new feeling?
Then, yes.
That is the precise order of events.
And on that note...
Oh, oh, yes.
I'll, uh... see you on Tuesday.
Buh-bye.
Alva.
I didn't see,
did you find that Heatherton contract?
I checked the back files under
Heatherton and "Rattlesnake Hills"
like you said,
but, uh... I couldn't find it.
I... I guess I'm gonna have
to look under the "Der Spiegel" files.
Alva, I told you
that I already checked those files.
- I already checked them.
- I'm sorry.
I must have, uh... misunderstood.
I'm gonna get right to it.

(HORNS HONKING)
I don't know, maybe.
It is inconceivable to me
that you like that play.
Inconceivable? Jesus Christ!
- Oh, well...
- My name's Gary, what's yours?
No, no, I don't save the same amount
I put in the other account.
Now say I put $2,000 in the IRA.
Now that doesn't mean I'm gonna save
$2,000 at income tax time.
It's more like $700. Right, Peter?
Yeah, plus, I get interest
on the $2,000 in the other account.
- Who would be interested?
- Uh...
- ...raise high the roof beam.
- (LAUGHS)
- Did you get that joke?
- No.
I love your earrings.

You fuck! Fuck you!
Yeah, well, fuck you, too, sister.
So how was your weekend?
It was all right, you know?
It was nothing earth-shattering.
Did you hurt yourself?
- Just cut myself shaving.
- Oh.
Well, Peter,
why don't we begin
where we left off last week?
You started to tell me
about this strange feeling you had
when this bat flew through
the window of your apartment.
Huh?
The feeling of exultation
that you experienced.
You made it sound as though it were...
something more than sexual.
I don't...
really know what you're talking about.
I don't remember.
Well, you were very sure
about it last weekend.
- It made a strong impression.
- Oh, yes. Okay, I know.
Uh, I guess I was pretty horny.
Pretty keyed up from being
with the girl right before.
I was drunk, too.
That was it.
I'd had a little to drink.
I was a little drunk.

All right, Alva,
that's Frank Heatherton on the phone.
For me. Now I'm sure he's calling about
the "Der Spiegel" contract,
which he still hasn't gotten a copy of.
How do I know he hasn't gotten a copy
of it? Because I haven't sent it to him.
Why haven't I sent it to him?
Because you haven't found it
and brought it to me
and now it's fucking Tuesday
and I still don't
see it here on my desk.
I don't see it here, do you?
Huh, Alva?! No!
Well, I'm going through the files,
Mr. Loew,
but I have a million other things to do.
Now, I want you to be here
and listen to the song and dance
that I have to do.
That I have to do
because you haven't done your job.
Ready?
- (PHONE BEEPS)
- Yeah, hi, Frank, how are ya?
Hello, Peter. I'm just fine, thanks.
Listen, I won't hold ya.
I just wanted to say
about that letter I sent,
you know, requesting the copy
of "Rattlesnake Hills" sale
to "Der Spiegel"?
There's absolutely no rush on that.
I know it's an old contract.
It's gonna take some diggin'
and I'm sure
you and your girls
got better things to do, huh?
(FRANK LAUGHS) Anyway, look,
I'm in the middle of movin',
 so take your time. I'll give you
a call when I'm all settled in. Okay?
- Yeah, okay, Frank.
- So, how's things with you?
- Life treatin' you well?
- Yeah, Frank.
Ah, good. Take care, old buddy.
- All right, bye-bye, Frank.
- Yeah, bye.
Well.
Seems I didn't have to do
a song and dance after all, Alva.
As you could hear,
I couldn't get a word in edgewise.
Mr. Heatherton is boiling mad,
and he has implied that if he
doesn't get that copy within the week,
he will terminate his agreement
with our agency
and sign up with a more efficient one.
Am I getting through to you, Alva?!
I'll go right to it, Mr. Loew.
Judy, I'll be out

Do you want to talk about it?
Well, it's just there's this...
contract we're trying to locate.
(EXHALES SLOWLY)
Shouldn't...
if a company...
if a literary agency...
makes a copy of every contract...
of every single contract
it makes with a client...
and then puts it in a file,
in the appropriate file...
shouldn't the copy...
be in that file?
- Yes, I suppose it should.
- It should, right?
- Yes.
- Right?
Hmm...
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep,
yep, yep, yep.
Unless, of course,
it's somehow been misfiled.
- Misfiled?!
- Yes, misfiled.
Sometimes somebody
puts a document in the wrong file
and then it's misfiled.
It makes it much harder to find.
Who? Who? What do you mean? Who?
- I don't know who exactly.
- You don't?
No, I don't.
Whoever filed it
in the first place, but...
for God sakes, Peter,
I am not telling you one single thing
- you don't already know.
- How could somebody misfile something?
What could be easier?
It's all alphabetical.
- We...
- You just put it in the right file.

Now, don't you think it would be

Aw.
Well, I was... I was also thinking today
that, maybe, you could put
somebody else on the job for a while.
Or another secretary to help me out?
I mean, you know,
to make the job easier.
Alva,
there is no one else
in this entire office

to share such a horrible job.
You're the lowest

The lowest. Do you realize that?
Every other secretary who's been here
has been here longer than you, Alva.
Every one.
And even if there was someone here
who was here just one day
longer than you,
I still wouldn't ask that person
to partake in such a miserable job
as long as you were around.
That's right, Alva.
It's a horrible, horrible job.

after old contract.
I couldn't think of a more
horrible job if I wanted to.
And you have to do it. You have to.
Or I'll fire you. Do you understand?

Oh, Alva, don't worry about it.

how worried you were
about losing Mr. Heatherton as a client.
Alva, right now
what's most important is your health.
Well, I'm... you see,
I'm not really sick, Mr. Loew.
It's just that, really,
I was just, you know,
afraid to go back to the office
without the contract.
Alva, I had a feeling that was the case
and that's why I came
all the way up here.
Because it's my fault you feel that way.
Oh, no, no, no.
I know you're trying to run
an efficient office.
That may be,
but some things just take time.
Hey, Alva. The way I feel is,

You know, if he wants
to go to another agency, fine.
So, what do you say?
Do you wanna come to work?

You will, Alva.
You're a very bright girl.

I... I thought you said that...
that you didn't care

left the agency.
I mean, I thought you said

Ah, but, Alva, that doesn't mean
we're gonna stop trying to do

If you got the time to lean,
you got the time to clean.
It's the same all around.
Old Man Randolph,
he throws fits all the time.
Oh, yeah? Well, listen to me, okay?
This guy is very weird.
I'm telling you.
- (GROANS)
- DRIVER: You all right, pal?
(PANTING)
That's my baby.
(STRAINED) Your...
- wife?
- 50 years. Keeps me going.
There is work and there is love.
I'm right?
You are married man?
Emilio.
Remember this?
I want you to give me bullets for it.
Put that away. Are you crazy?
No, I'm not crazy!
You gave it to me, right?
Well, then, what good is it
if I can't use it?
Shh! What's good
is it'll scare the shit
out of any motherfucker
comes close enough to spit on you.
Look, you ain't even supposed
to be carrying this thing around.
Please? I'm asking you, Emilio.
Where is that little cunt?
(LAUGHS) Look...
Randolph don't even
keep real bullets in his gun, man.
Ah, no? But what about the robbery?
I mean, when those pigs
came here to rob...
He scared them off with blanks.
That's all he has here, Alva,
is blanks, you know?
Okay, then give me the fucking blanks.
Fine.
$44.50 only.
Fucking clean me right out!
Crazy Jews.
(TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING)

JUDY: Arthur Hesse on L-1, Mr. Loew.
Tell him I'm out.
In fact, tell anyone who calls
I'm out. I'm in a meeting.
JUDY: Are you all right, Mr. Loew?
- Tell him I'm in a meeting.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Loew.
It's impossible.
It can't be.

She don't want to get out of bed.

Very lifelike.
See the way they color them?
Just a little touch of yellow
so they blend in better.
- How much?
- Those are $19.95.
What's the matter?
Do you have anything for less?
Oh, sure.

All right.
Just tell me when you see him.
Sorry, I forgot. Where did we leave off?
Well, Peter, you wanted very much
to make an earlier appointment,
so what's up?
Well, I've been thinking about
my depressions very seriously,
and frankly,
I just don't think you can help me.
I think your profession
is entirely bogus.
Entirely.
From my point of view, that is.
You really think so?
Yes, I do. I've been spending
a lot of money here
and I just think it's time for a change.
A change?
What exactly did you
have in mind for yourself?
- Don't laugh.
- I'm a professional, I don't laugh.
Um...
love.
Love?
Yes, baby, real love.
The sweep-me-off-my-feet,
- the big L.
- (POLICE SIREN BLARING)
What?
No, I'm not talking about
fairytale love.
I'm talking about a mature relationship.
What do you think, I'm a kid?
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking,
"Sure, let's see him go out
in the jungle and try to find love.
He'll come crawling
back here in no time."
I know it isn't easy,
but I know it's possible.
Hell, I see it around me every day.
Do you know how horrible
it is to see it around you every day?
Do you know
what kind of torture that is?
I'll find it, God damn it.
I'll find it for myself,
and then I'll be happy.
Holy shit, then I'll be happy.
(SNICKERING)
I mean... (LAUGHING)
You said you wouldn't laugh.
I am... (LAUGHS)
It just... um... (LAUGHS)
I'm sorry. I'm only... (LAUGHS)
I'm only laughing because, well, uh...
if you had told me,
if you had just told the good doctor...
the time you could have saved.
The money the both of you
could have saved.
Both of us? Both of us?
What do you mean the both of us?
(WHISPERS) You and Sharon.
- (WHISPERS) Sharon?
- (DR. GLASER WHISPERING) Yes!
The patient who comes in after you.
She complains of exactly
the same thing you do and...
(CHUCKLES)
...personality-wise,
I think you two are made for each other.
- Really?
- Oh!
I should have matched
you two guys up a long time ago!
- (DOORBELL RINGS)
- Hey, I think she's here now.
I'll just go and check.
Sharon.
What a beautiful name.
It's incredible.
It's really incredible.
Ah!
Sharon, this is Peter Loew.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I like poetry, horseback riding,
Vivaldi,
and long weekends in the country.
Those are exactly
the same things that I like.
Wait a minute.
"We walked along, while bright and red
uprose the rising sun."
- Wordsworth.
- Incredible.
Wow.
I guess you two
won't be needing me anymore.
I guess not.
Thank you so much, Dr. Glaser.
This one's going to last, I can tell.
- It was written in the stars.
- Written in the stars, yes.
- Do you like Japanese food, Sharon?
- It's the best. So...
- BOTH: ...refreshing.
- Did you see that?
We're on exactly the same wavelength.
Fantastic.
So long, Dr. Glaser.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Yes, Peter?
Well, I did rape someone
a couple nights ago.
A girl at the office.
I just lost control.
It's just a little id release,
no use to worry.
(EXHALES SLOWLY)
I just thought I should tell you, okay?
It's a load off my mind.
Oh, yeah...
also, I, uh...
Just spit it out, Peter.
Well, the fact is,
I did murder someone last night.
I turned into a vampire,
it's a long story.
- Goodness.
- DR. GLASER: Peter, Peter, Peter,
people get murdered every day
in this city.
Do you think the world is going to stop?
Yeah, I guess, but the police
and everything. What if they find me?
Would you stop worrying
and just get on with your big romance.
He hasn't even been arrested
and the big lug is carrying on.
Now, just get out of here,
the both of you.
Have a wonderful life together
and I will take care of the cops.
Go on, get out, both of you.
Out, out, out.
Tsh, tsh, tsh.
Thank you very much, Dr. Glaser.
(SMOOCHES) You are a gem.
Come on, Sharon.
(WHISTLING)
You like that tune?
Yeah.
Well, actually,
I live up right around here.
Do you wanna come up? You can join me.
Okay.
Well, I was born in Philadelphia,
but I've been a New Yorker now
for going on 10 years.
What about you?
- Ah, nice.
- WOMAN: Here you go.
It's very beautiful country up there.
Yeah.
What?
This?
It's like I started saying before,
I turned into a vampire last week.
It's all in the past, though.
You okay? You know...
(GASPS) There he is.
Nah, I don't wanna
talk about it anymore.
I mean, it's all from
a very unhappy period in my life
and I don't wanna talk about it.
End of subject, okay?
Sharon...
God damn it, what'd I just say?
(ALVA WHIMPERING)
You don't let up, do you, cunt?
I mean, you just keep harpin'
and harpin' over the same goddamn thing.
(IMITATES WOMAN)
"Why did you become a vampire?
Why couldn't you be normal?
Well, Peter, does this mean
we can never have children?"
'Cause there's no way in hell
that I would ever, ever marry
a loudmouth pig like you.
'Cause in the 10 minutes I'm with you
and the shit just starts right up.
What? What?
You hate my guts?
You wanna go home?
You wanna leave? Good. Fine.
