Okay, go ahead.
My name is Sidney Westerfeld.
I'm the owner of this antique tavern...
...Monmouth Valley, New York State.
I was here when
this crowd really came.
We expected fifty thousand a day,
and there must have been a million!
l, myself, was hungry for two days,
because I couldn't get any food in.
I couldn't get out to buy any food.
I was eating cornflakes for two days!
And the kids were wonderful.
I have no kicks.
It was "sir" this and "sir" that, and...
..."thank you" this and
"thank you" that.
Nobody can complain about the kids.
This thing was too big.
It was too big for the world!
Nobody has ever seen a thing like this!
And when they see this picture in
the news, over the moving pictures...
...they'll really see something!
"It's been a long time coming..."
"...because it's been
a long time gone..."
"...and it appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...time. It's a long,
long, long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
"Turn, turn any corner."
"Hear, hear, you must hear..."
"...what the people say."
"You know that something..."
"...is going on around here."
"But surely, surely, surely..."
"...one day I'm going to have my day."
"Oh, it appears to be
a long, yes it does..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...ah-ha, such a long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
"Speak out, you've got to speak out..."
"...against the madness."
"You've got to speak your
mind, yes, today..."
"...but don't, no, don't, don't
try to get yourself elected."
"If you do, you'll have
to cut your hair..."
"...and it appears to be
a long, yes, it does..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...time, such a long,
long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
"It's been a long time coming..."
"...it's going to be
a long time gone..."
"...but you know..."
"...the darkest hour..."
"...the darkest phase, is always
just before the dawn..."
"...and it appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long time..."
"...such a long, long,
long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
Hey, Mike, what's the worst part
of running one of these things?
The worst part?
What's the worst part of running one?
I don't know.
You dig it all?
I guess the biggest hassle is
dealing with politics. You know.
Is there a lot of politics involved?
You mean with the cities?
And you got that solved?
Well, it looks that way.
How long did it take you to put
it together. Two, three months?
Uh, been working on it
for about nine months.
Nine months! Full time?
Are you in charge of the whole thing?
Yes.
But you got backers?
Partners and backers.
Where are you going to go from here?
I mean, are you going
to do another one?
If it works.
Aw, you're really good tonight!
You know...
...this is the most outrageous spectacle
I've ever witnessed. Ever!
There's only one thing I wish.
I sure have to pee!
And there just is nowhere to go!
I believe we're "GOING UP THE
COUNTRY" a little bit right now.
"I'm going up the country,
baby, don't you want to go?"
"I'm going up the country,
baby, don't you want to go?"
"I'm going to someplace,
where I've never been before."
"I'm going, I'm going, where
the water tastes like wine."
"I'm going where the
water tastes like wine."
"We can jump in the water,
stay drunk all the time."
"I'm going to leave this city.
Got to get away."
"I'm going to leave this city.
Got to get away."
"All this fussing and fighting,
man, you know I sure can't stay."
"Now, baby, pack your leaving trunk.
You know we've got to leave today."
"Just exactly where
we're going, I cannot say..."
"...but we might even leave the U.S.A."
"Because it's a brand new
game and I want to play."
"No use in your running or
screaming and crying..."
"...because you've got a home
as long as I've got mine."
"If you smile at me,
I will understand..."
"...because that is something everybody,
everywhere does in the same way."
"I can't see why you called
a friend from the other side."
"There's just one thing
I've got to know..."
"...can you tell me who I am?"
"Say, can I have some of
your purple berries?"
"Yes, I've been eating them
six or seven weeks now."
"Haven't got sick once,
probably keep us both alive."
"Wooden ships on the water..."
"...very free, easy, easy."
"You know, the way it's supposed to be."
"Silver people on the
shoreline, let us be."
"Talking about very free and easy."
"All the ships that
watch as you die..."
"...all they can do is
echo your anguished cry."
"Still I go keep on feeling, why?"
"We are leaving. You don't need us."
What do you think?
Well, what could I think?
We're in the middle of the, of the
situation and we make the best of it.
It's about all we can do.
We were standing on the curbs
watching them come in, uh, last night.
All the townspeople.
It was just like a, an army invading
a town. It's hard to believe.
Do you live here?
No, we're here for a vacation.
Are you having one?
We did, up until last night.
They kept us up for a while.
Who is they?
Freaks.
Is that what you call yourselves?
Sure.
Why?
Well, because that's what
everybody else calls us.
What do you call yourself that for?
Because we admit it. Compared
to everybody else, we're freaks.
I don't think you are. As long as you
behave yourself, there's nothing wrong.
I'm not putting bad connotations on the
word "freak", you know. I'm just...
Don't you think that the word "freak"
itself has a bad connotation?
It's whatever you think about it.
Last time we saw anything like this was
at the Rose Bowl Parade last New Year's.
That's right.
Like four ice cubes
out of the bag, you know.
They wanted to buy four ice cubes?
Yeah, right.
I don't know, what can you charge
them for ice cubes? You know.
It's a great shot in the arm to Sullivan
County, business-wise.
Something we needed.
As far as whether it will leave a
favorable effect later, besides money...
...we'll know when the festival is over.
Uh, they're beautiful people.
Well is this festival
affecting you in any way?
Well, it's kind of overwhelming us.
Put it this way.
In what way?
Just to take care of,
to try to get the people fed,
I would say is one of the main
objectives here.
I know all these young fellows here,
they've got to be fed
and they're going to get hungry.
I hope that they can bring
enough supplies in for, for...
That seems to be the big trouble.
And traffic, that's... well, you know
yourself without me telling you.
What's it done for business?
Oh, come on.
What's it done?
Increased it about what?
As much as you can do.
Put it this way. And more.
I'll say one thing for the young people.
They've been very nice.
All of them. So far.
It's really amazing. Yet it looks like
some kind of Biblical, epochal...
...unbelievable scene!
They're all, you know, like all...
You see these cars,
they're strewn on the sides of
the roads from the helicopters and...
...in all different angles, you know. They
look like jackstraws and stuff like that.
There is this continual flow of people
just riding the stream.
They're going along and it...
Jerry, it was all frozen.
So let's enjoy. It was all I could get.
Well, I mean, I mean,
from a practical point of view,
what do you think,
how could they limit this crowd?
They didn't want this many people
here, really, I don't think.
So you find the control points at
the beginning of the highways...
...and those with tickets are allowed
in and those without tickets are not.
You have to have some control.
You know, when you
have man-eating...
...Barabunda ants coming over
a hill in South America...
...they want to cut them off and stop
them from coming. They make a ditch...
...they put oil in the ditch and
they make a flame.
Now I'm not saying they should put up
flames to stop the people...
...but there has to be some way of
stopping the influx of humanity.
Uh, in numbers, tell me,
how many do you expect?
Two hundred thousand.
Two hundred thousand people
here over the three days?
Where will you put them?
We have contracted for land
surrounding the area...
...setting up camp grounds, water
facilities, toilets, electric, food.
What does it cost to put one
of these things together?
A fortune.
And I suppose the returns
will also be good.
Yeah, we'll probably... I don't, I don't
know what the returns will come up to...
...up to what it's cost or not, but...
...the point is that it's happening.
A couple of million dollars.
In other words, you have to make
two million dollars to break even?
Well, if we're going to break even.
Huh, you know.
The point is that it's
happened and it's working...
...and it's enough for now.
What is it that musicians have?
Are you a musician yourself?
What is it the musicians have that they
can communicate so well to the kids?
Music!
I mean, they've always had music.
Music has always been a
major form of communication.
Only now the lyrics and the type
of music is a little bit...
...more involved
in society than it was.
I need something now, let me tell you,
to kind of run as a voice over...
when I'm showing this music on...
If you could, if you could tell me...
...that I can run your voice over
while this music is playing...
...what the music is saying, kind
of, you know, what that's about.
It's about what's happening now...
...and if you listen to the lyrics
and you listen to the, to the rhythm...
...and, and what's in the music...
...then you'll know what's,
what's going on with the culture.
I've got to split.
Can we count on you?
Great, groovy. Thanks.
I'd like... Mike hangs out here.
I'd like to see a little bit of him.
Just natural sound, while he's
getting harassed and bugged. Okay?
Now, goddamnit, I was going
to call you last week!
That means you've got to call me and
I've got to get that thing into the air.
Now I'm going to order
a five-passenger helicopter.
I'm really scared the roads
are going to get jammed up.
If anybody wants anymore rooms...
...shows up with more people
than they're supposed to have...
...tell them they can drop
back fifteen yards and punt!
They've got about as much chance
as a snow ball in hell...
...of getting a room closer
than Middletown.
There's a Holiday Inn in
Middletown, New York.
Let's clear the road, please!
Peel back, peel back there!
Let them through.
Everything has room to flow here.
Please walk...
...on the grass.
Walk on the sides of the road if you're
going to walk through here. Let's go.
How is it out there?
We apologize for the, uh, noise
of the choppity-choppy, but...
...it seems there are a few cars blocking
the road, so we're flying everybody in.
I almost made the worst pun in the world
about high musicians, but we'll skip that.
You know Artie? Artie Kornfeld.
How you doing, man?
Good to see you, man.
Glad you could make the party.
It's going beautifully, man.
Wouldn't have it any other way.
It's really together.
Look at the way...
It really worked out nice, didn't it?
Looks fantastic!
The vibes are so beautiful.
Everybody helps everybody.
Today it feels so great
right here, you know?
How can I ever live on the east
side of Manhattan after this scene?
Yeah, man, it smells like strawberries!
It's perfume! Oh, it is!
"Just Like A Woman"...
...and "Let's Get Stoned."
We're in sync, but you can't
hear a fucking thing...
...because of the fucking helicopters,
so I'm going to quit!
Because of the fucking helicopters...
...I can't get a fucking piece
of dialogue at all, man.
I'm hanging around
blowing my brains out!
We're getting it tied up.
Two or three of the groups are in.
We're just trying to match up two groups
and equipment and we'll be okay.
Can those of you in the back hear well?
Raise your hands please.
It's all right? Thank you.
Marijuana! Exhibit A.
Look at all those people!
The Daily News, in rather large
headlines, still costing ten cents...
..."TRAFFIC UP TIGHT AT HIPPIE FEST."
See, if you see the,
show the picture in India...
...they won't believe
this is taken in America.
Because their impression
of American children...
...and American ways
is completely different.
All neatly dressed, put on hat
and tie and sitting on chairs.
That's not like this at all.
Wheat Germ, Holly has your bag
with your medicine.
Please meet at the information booth
as soon as you can, please.
Helen Savage, please call your father
at the Motel Glory in Woodridge.
The warning that I've received
you might take it...
...with however many grains
of salt you wish...
...that the brown acid that is circulating
around is not specifically too good.
It is suggested that you stay
away from that...
...but it's your own trip, so be my guest.
Please be advised there is
a warning on the one, okay?
Sam, can you get the monitors on?
Get some more guys over here.
This is going to be the heavy side.
Richard Boch, get back to Eddie
Kramer in the sound truck.
- Watch your fingers right up there!
- Hold it.
Mr. Richie Havens!
"Hey, look-a yonder,
tell me what's that you see..."
"...marching to the fields of concord?"
"Looks like Handsome Johnny, with
his flintlock in his hand..."
"...marching to the Concord war."
"...hey, marching to the Concord war."
"Hey, look-a yonder,
tell me what's that you see..."
"...marching to the fields of Dunkirk?"
"Looks like Handsome Johnny
with a carbine in his hand..."
"...marching to the Dunkirk war."
"Hey, marching to the Dunkirk war."
"Hey, look-a yonder,
tell me what's that you see..."
"...marching to the fields of Korea?"
"Looks like Handsome Johnny
with his M-1 in his hand..."
"...marching to the Korean war."
"Hey, marching to the Korean war."
"Still marching, still
marching, still marching."
"It's a long, hard road..."
"...that he fought so we'll be free."
"That he fought, we'll be free.
Yeah, free!"
"Hey, look-a yonder,
tell me what's that you see..."
"...marching to the
fields of Birmingham?"
"Looks like Handsome Johnny with
his hand rolled in a fist..."
"...marching to the Birmingham war."
"Hey, marching to the Birmingham war."
"Hey, what's the use
of singing this song?"
"Some of you are not even listening."
"Tell me what it is we've got to do?"
"Wait for the bombs to start whistling?"
"Wait for the blitz to start blitzing?"
"Here comes a hydrogen bomb..."
"...and here comes a guided missile."
"Here comes a hydrogen bomb..."
"...I cannot hear it whistle!"
"I can almost hear its whistle,
yeah, yeah, yeah!"
There are a hundred million
songs going to be sung tonight.
All of them are going to be
singing about the same thing...
...which I hope everybody who
came, came to hear, really.
And it's all about you, actually.
And me and everybody around this stage
and everybody that hasn't gotten here.
And the people who are going
to read about you tomorrow.
And how really groovy you were.
All over the world.
If you can dig where that's at.
That's really where it's really at.
Guitar mike, please.
"Freedom! Freedom!"
"Sometimes I feel like
a motherless child..."
"...a long way from home."
"Yeah, yeah, Lord..."
"...singing freedom! Freedom!"
"Sometimes I feel like
I'm almost gone..."
"...a long, long, long
way, way from home."
"Clap your hands!"
"I've got a telephone in my bosom..."
"...and I can call
him up from my heart."
"I've got a telephone in my bosom..."
"...and I can call him
up from my heart..."
"...when I need my brother!"
"When I need my father! "
"Mother!"
"Sister!"
"When I need my brother!"
"Brother! Hey! Mother! "
"Mr. Richie Havens."
What better way to start than
with the beautiful "Richie Havens."
It's worth it.
Just to see the lights
go on last night, man!
Just to see the people stand up,
man, it makes it worth it.
I mean, I feel there will be people,
you know...
...there are people out there
that really don't dig it.
Very few of them.
But you know, it really is to
the point where it's just a family, man.
All box office people please
go to the main box office.
We don't need it any more.
Somebody unplugged the lines, man.
Let's have a hot mike.
Number two, number three.
You are not giving the world's
greatest three day freebee!
Okay, there's only one way to do it.
There's a way to do it, man.
There is no way.
The only way to do it is
to get into a rap with...
It's okay. Come here. Come here.
This is one thing I was going to wait
a while before we talked about it.
But maybe we'll talk about it now so
you can think about it.
It's a free concert from now on!
That doesn't mean that anything goes.
What that means is...
...we're going to put the
music up here for free.
What it means is that the people
who are backing this thing...
...who put up the money for it,
are going to take a bit of a bath.
A big bath. There's no hype, that's
true. They're going to get hurt.
But what it means is that these
people have it in their heads...
...that your welfare is a hell
of a lot more important...
...and so is the music, than a dollar.
Look, when they hook the electricity up,
a great jolt runs all the way through here.
If you've got the ticket,
you disconnect the circuit and...
...otherwise you disintegrate.
Wendy and Mayar... , Maynard...
...from Fair Lawn, please meet
Jill in front of the stage.
George has a slight problem.
He broke his arm.
Oh, it's on Forty-second Street. Tiny Tim
used to sing there. Did you know that?
Under the name of Robert, uh, Love.
Larry Love!
Could I get the picture, too?
Oh, yes. Toot too, too, too.
Tell me, little girl, what's your name?
My name is Beth Riley, and what's yours?
My name is Hugh.
How do you do? My name is Sue.
I'll see you around.
Ah, here they come, here they come.
My name is Hugh Romney. I'm with the
Hog Farm. And I'm working on a scene.
Some people call it bum trips. I don't
think there is such a thing as a bum trip.
We're working with hobo voyages.
A half an hour after we release anybody
from our section...
...we turn them into doctors...
...and they care for people that were
tripping like they were when they came in.
Now people have been saying that
some of this acid is poison.
It's not poison, it's just bad acid.
It's manufactured poorly.
If you can find out who it is, we...
Anybody who thinks they've
taken some poison, forget it.
And if you feel like experimenting,
only take half a tab. Okay? Thank you.
You know, the Japanese
made that motorcycle.
The Japanese affected that
thing over there...
...with the yellow robes,
or the Indian.
Really does a lot for the music
that motorcycle.
Who's on?
A guy named Bert Sommers.
I think Timmy Hardin is going on next.
So the order of everything
just went kaplooey?
You're closing tonight, honey.
Maybe there'll be
a few more people here by then.
I don't like a puny gathering like this.
I'd like to sing you a song that is one of
my husband, David's, favorite songs.
And let me just tell you
that he is fine. And...
...and we're fine too.
And David was just shifted
from the county jail...
...which is very much of a drag,
to Federal prison...
...which is kind of like
a big summer camp...
...after you've been
in county jail long enough.
See I just, just now got a letter.
I have it with me. About the trip from the
county jail. Manacles on his legs...
...and his arms manacled to his belt.
Well, I mean, it's all worth writing about.
He doesn't care, you know.
And there's only one time that...
...where the first time he felt afraid
in the whole thing, was a couple of...
...I guess guards, or something,
they started talking very loud.
And he started saying...
...talking about the last draft case
that they had been through...
...and "that motherfucker," and "we'll
get you, motherfucker," you know?
He just prayed a little bit harder.
He wouldn't do anything anyhow, but
it's not a very comfortable feeling.
But nothing has happened.
Anyway, this is, this
is an organizing song.
And I'm, I was happy to find out that...
...after David had been in jail
for two and a half weeks...
...he already had a very,
very good hunger strike...
...going on with forty-two
federal prisoners...
...none of whom were draft people.
"I dreamed I saw Joe
Hill last night..."
"...alive as you and me."
"Sez l, 'But Joe,
you're ten years dead!"'
"'I never died, ' said he."
"'The copper bosses
killed you, Joe!"'
"'They shot you, Joe, ' says I."
"'Takes more than guns
to kill a man'..."
"Says Joe, 'I didn't die!"'
"And standing there as big as life..."
"...and smiling with his eyes."
"Says Joe, 'What they
can never kill,"
"...went on to organize."'
"From San Diego up to Maine..."
"...in every mine and mill..."
"...where working men
defend their rights..."
"...it's there you find Joe Hill!"
"Swing low..."
"...sweet chariot..."
"...coming to carry me home."
"Swing low..."
"...sweet chariot..."
"...coming for to carry me on home."
"Well, I looked over yonder..."
"...and what did I see..."
"...coming to carry me home?"
"Saw a band, a band of angels..."
"...were a-coming for me..."
"...coming for to carry me on home."
"Swing low..."
"...swing low, sweet chariot..."
"...coming for to carry
me on home. Home!"
"See me,"
"feel me,"
"touch me,"
"heal me."
"Listening to you, I get music."
"Gazing at you, I get heat."
"Following you, I'd climb a mountain."
"I get excitement at your feet."
"Right behind you, I see the millions."
"On you, I see the glory."
"From you, I get opinions."
"From you, I get the story."
"Listening to you, I get music."
"Gazing at you, I get the heat."
"Following you, I'd climb a mountain."
"I get excitement at your feet."
"From behind you, I see the millions."
"On you, I see the glory."
"From you, I get opinions."
"From you, I get the story."
"Now, I'm a-gonna raise a fuss.
Now, I'm going to raise a holler..."
"...about a-working all summer,
just to try and earn a dollar."
"Well, I went to the boss,
said, 'I've got a date."'
"The boss said, 'No dice, son.
You've got to work-a late."'
"Sometimes, I wonder
what I'm going to do."
"There ain't no cure for
the summertime blues."
"Well, my mom and poppa told me,
'Son, you've got to earn some money..."'
"'... if you want to use the
car to go riding next Sunday."'
"Well, I didn't go to work.
I told the boss I was sick."
"Says they, 'You can't use the car,
because you didn't work a lick."'
"Sometimes I wonder what
I'm a-gonna do."
"There ain't no cure for
the summertime blues."
"I'm going to take two weeks,
going to have a fine vacation."
"Going to take my problems
to the United Nations."
"Well, I went to my Congressman.
He said..."
"'... l'd like to help you, son,
but you're too young to vote."'
"Sometimes I wonder
what I'm going to do."
"There ain't no cure for
the summertime blues."
Ladies and gentlemen...
...The Who!
The word I get is that...
...maybe the best thing
for everybody to do...
...unless you have a tent
or some place specific to go to...
...just carve yourself out
a piece of territory...
...say goodnight to your neighbor...
...and say thank you to yourself
for making this the most peaceful...
...most pleasant day anybody has
ever had in this kind of music.
Well, music is a thing that...
Well, you're obviously
not here for the girls.
Oh, that's good, that's a basic
thing, you know, like...
...there are a lot of girls here
and they're probably...
...a lot freer than,
you know, other places.
I'm sure there's going
to be a lot of balling.
Well, you bring your own coals
to Newcastle?
Are you two going together
or are you just hitching together?
We've lived together for about
four months, or five months.
You know, with a lot of other people.
Kind of what you'd call...
...a communal thing, or someone
else would call a communal thing.
But it's just, we just live together...
...and so we just decided to come down
together because we were coming here.
And like there's nothing, I mean,
no definite thing about...
We're not necessarily going to be
together throughout the whole thing.
So you're not particularly
jealous of him?
Are you two going together?
But you two came up here together.
You like that?
Yeah, I like her.
I love her. I enjoy her.
What do you think about all this?
Well, the way I look at it...
...like I've known Jerry for what?
Four or five, six months now.
When he moved into the family group...
...that I was alr...
that I already knew for quite a while...
...in that time, I got to know him
real well and I learned to love him.
Like, you know, we ball
and everything, but...
...it's really a pretty good thing because
I have plenty, there's plenty of freedom.
Because if we're not going together and
we're not in love or anything like that...
Can you communicate
with your parents?
I can communicate with
them on, on one level.
Now that I've been away
from home for two years.
But at first it was very rough.
Now...
...they, you know, they're beginning
to mellow about it.
It's not so hard on them I'm the way I am.
But I can't really communicate to them...
...about anything that's really important
because they just could not understand it.
My mother is really, she really...
...lives in a lot of pain...
...because she's sure I'm going to
go to hell and there's nothing I can do...
...to tell her that there is,
that it just does not exist for me.
So l, there's no communication
on, on those levels.
My father was asking whether I was in a
communist training camp or something...
...in, in the house that I lived in.
I could understand, you know, where
he came from. Because when he...
...well, he's an immigrant, you know.
And so he came over here
to better himself...
...economically and so forth,
and all that other rot.
And, to make it better for me and he can't
understand why I didn't play, you know...
...saying, "Why aren't
you playing the game?"
"Here's all this opportunity.
Here's, here are all these things...
...which have so much value."
But they only have value to him...
...and he can't understand
why they don't have value to me.
But he does have wisdom enough
to know, to allow me to be who I am.
I guess he had some kind of
idea in his head that...
...I will, by doing what I'm doing,
learn for myself how to live.
And that's what he wants me to do,
anyway.
So he, he can't understand
why I am the way I am...
...but he, he very much wants
me to be that way.
Because he knows that's
the only thing for me.
He started his trip when
he was four years old.
Really?
Nothing to do with drugs or anything?
Me, neither.
Do you think that's a cop-out or...?
l, I don't know. L, I used
to be into drugs and...
...I was very heavy on drugs, but...
...now it seems like
it's almost contrived.
It's like drugs and revolution
and the united front and all.
You know, I'm a human being and that's
all I want to be. And I don't...
...I don't want to have a mass change...
...because a mass change only brings
around mass insanity.
I just want to be myself and find
out, find a place where I can...
...maintain some kind of
balance within myself, you know.
I'm kind of like the Hamlet trip,
you know. To be or not to be.
Do you think you could ever communicate
with a guy like Nixon or Westmoreland?
I hope so.
They're doing their thing, aren't they?
I don't know. It's like they,
they're neurotic or psychotic or...
...having fun as they say in
Life Mag... I don't know.
They could say the same thing of you.
Yeah, right. But it's not true, because,
l, I don't need all that power, you know.
Where I can just, I can just sit
here right on this roadside...
...and l, I don't have to become
President of the United States.
And I don't have to go all that way up.
I don't have to make the climb.
Because there's nothing to climb for.
It's all sitting right here.
Do you have tickets to this thing?
No.
How are you going to get in?
I don't really know.
I figured, you know, once I got here...
...l'd see whatever happens
and go along with it.
It's like people that are nowhere
are coming here...
...because there are people
they think are somewhere...
...so everybody is really looking for,
you know, for some kind of answer.
Where there isn't one.
Why would three hundred thousand...
...or a hundred and
twenty thousand sixty thousand...
...seventy thousand people come
to anything just because it's music?
I mean, was music all that important?
I don't really think so.
People don't know, they don't know how
to live and they don't know what to do...
...and they think that if they...
...can come here they can find out.
You know, what it is...
...or how to maintain with it.
It's just like people
are very lost, I think.
America leads the whole
world in several ways.
Very recently, when
I was in the East...
...the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi...
...met me and asked me...
...what's happening in America?
And I said,
"America is becoming a whole."
"America is helping everybody..."
"...in the material field..."
"...but the time has come for
America to help the whole world..."
"...with spirituality, also."
"At the hop..."
"...we can rock to and fro and
never let go, at the hop, hop, hop."
"When the records are playing,
people eat a lot of chicken..."
"...at the hop, hop, hop."
"If you've got a little chicken, share
it with your baby, at the hop, hop, hop."
"Oh, baby, hop! Let's go to the hop.
Oh, baby, let's go to the hop."
"Oh, baby, let's go to the hop!
Oh, baby, let's go to the Hop!"
"Well, let us go now. Let's go to the
hop. Let's go to the hop, oh, baby!"
"Let's go to the hop, oh, baby.
Let's go to the hop."
"Go, go, let's go to the hop!
Let's go, go!"
"We will go rocking and rolling
and stomping at the hop!"
"When the records are playing and the
women start a-singing at the hop!"
"Oh, let's go now.
Let's go to the hop! "
"Let's go to the hop, oh baby.
Let's got to the hop, oh baby."
"Come on, let's go to the hop.
Hop!"
