Uh, we're a Vietnamese restaurant.
We just don't have bread.
Well, you're not Vietnamese.
No, l'm not.

Fuck, bamboo. Whatever.

Waiter number 1 2.

Thanks for the time
That you've given me
The memories are all in my mind
And now that we've come
To the end of our rainbow
There's something l must say out loud
Yes, you're once, twice
Three times a lady
l love you
Yes, you're once, twice
Three times a lady
l love you
l love you
Shit, yo.
- Holy shit!
- What's up, man?
Largeman, what are you doing here?
Uh... that's my mom.
- Fuck.
- Aw, fuck.
- Sorry.
- Yeah.
So... welcome back home.
Thanks.
So, what have you been doin'?
- You still acting and shit, right?
- Yeah.
- ln L.A., right?
- Yeah.
That's cool.
l hear that place is, like, fucking crazy.
My cousin's a writer out there.
He says that place is, like, mad crazy.
He's, like, writing a movie
about snowboarders or some shit.
l don't, l don't know. Um...
l should introduce you to him, Largeman.
Maybe you could do something together.
Yeah, definitely.
What are you doing tonight, man?
Uh... nothin', you know.
You know, no real plans.
Just in town for a couple of days, so...
You should come out with us. We're
gonna go over to the Gleasons' house.
They're having some...
fucking huge party or something.
- Supposedly.
- Well, yeah, supposedly.
- Really?
- He lives up on the hill.
We'll probably go over there
after we bury your mom.
- Well, l got to shower.
- Same.
Do you know your mother
redid the hallway bathroom?
What? l'm sorry, what?
Since l met her, she never
showed an interest in anything.
All of a sudden,
a month ago, she wakes up,
she wants to redecorate her bathroom.
l helped her.
- Oh, must have been fun.
- Well, l sew.
l made you something.
lt's a shirt.
That's-That's good.
Thank you.
Will you try it on now?
- Now?
- Well, in case l have to fix it
before you leave again, and we
don't see you for another nine years.
l want to make sure it fits.
Oh, OK.
You're gonna love the material.
l used the leftovers
from your mother's design. Gorgeous.
Hi.
Hello.
How you doin'?
''Well, besides that, Mrs. Lincoln,
how was the show?''
You know, l'm not really sure
what to say here, Dad, so l'm sorry.
Hmm.
How are you?
l'm OK. l've been getting these
really bad headaches, though.
Um... they're really quick.
lt's like a, like just a little
lightening storm in my head.
Just for a second, and then it's gone.
l just thought maybe you could help me
get that checked out while l'm home.
Go see Dr. Cohen
first thing in the morning.
He's a neurologist in my building.
l-l'll call him.
He'll fit you in.
l'm sure it's nothing to worry about.
- Place looks good.
- Oh, that's nice.
Yeah, we've been doing
a lot of work on it.
Really?
Actually, no.
l don't know why l just said that.
Someone redid the hallway bathroom.
l saw that.
Yeah, that's new.
l'm glad you're here.
Saying goodbye is important.
l'm glad you could fit it in.
I think I'll go home and mull this over
Before I cram it down my throat
At long last it's crashed
Its colossal mass
Has broken up into bits in my moat
Lift the mattress off the floor
Walk the cramps off.
go meander in the cold
Hail to your dark skin
Hiding the fact you're dead again
Underneath the power lines
seeking shade...
- Put your hands on your head, please!
- What?
l said, put your motherfucking hands
on you head... please.
82 in a 25. What are you gonna tell me,
you're late or you're just tired?
- l was--
- Shut the fuck up!
- Largeman!
- Kenny?
Holy shit!
Oh, man! How you doin?
l'm... l'm great!
- You're mom just died!
- l know!
- l mean, that's why you're home.
- Yeah, yep.
- You're a cop, Kenny?
- Yeah. l know, l know.
Why?
l don't know.
Couldn't think of anything better to do.
No, but it's really cool, though, man.
People really listen to you.
l mean... they have to!
Yo, and check this shit out.
That's the safety.
- Oh, cool.
- And plus, the benefits, man.
lf l get shot, l'm like, mmm! Rich!
But Kenny, the last time l saw you,
you were doing coke lines off a urinal.
La-la-la-la
No, l had to grow up, man.
lt's time to grow up.
Plus, l wasn't making shit
in that fish market.
No, no one knew who l was.
Couldn't get laid.
lt's a much better situation for me, man.
Speaking of which, um...
- ...how'd l do?
- What do you mean?
l don't know.
You know, just the whole...
You mean, like... as a cop?
Yeah, the whole, ''Shut the fuck up!''
Well, l thought you were a dick,
so l guess that's good.
Nice!
So, what the fuck, man?
You're this huge movie star now?
l heard you did some...
You played a big football player?
l didn't see it.
Oh, yeah, just this thing.
- Fucking De Niro and shit!
- What?
- He's awesome.
- Yeah.
- Deer Hunter ?
- Yeah.
Man... we should sit down.
We should talk,
because l've got some really good ideas
for movies. You could play me and shit!
Stories From the Force.
Yeah, definitely.
That sounds good.
- Holy shit!
- Hi, what's up?
- How you doin', man?
- Good. How you doin', man?
- How you doin?
- Get this guy a beer. Give him your beer.
This guy does not wait for a beer.
He's a movie star!
He's like, Jersey's De Niro and shit.
Largeman, man,
what are you doing home?
- l, uh...
- Press junket.
Oh, that's phat, yo!
Fuck, yeah!
Serpico and shit! ''Attica!''
Shut the fuck up, man.
You like that?
Like ''press junket''?
That's improv, bitch.
You can use it.
All right? OK.
Let me show you something.
Largeman! Whoa, whoa.
What's goin' on, man?
How you been, man? Hey!
- Jess, how are you, bro?
- Whoa! How's it goin', man?
What's goin' on, man? l haven't seen you
in so long. l heard you're kickin' ass.
Oh, basically the man
bought my silent Velcro patent.
- What?
- l developed this little item.
lt's just like Velcro, but it doesn't
make that... the Velcro noise.
- So, how much did they buy it for?
- A lot, man!
Wow. So, what are you
doing with yourself?
Um, yeah, nothing. Nothing.
l've never been so bored in my whole life.
First month, l went out, you know.
l bought a whole bunch of shit.
But, you know-- Nothing.
Someone got a joint for me?
Mmm.
Here you go.
Ugh. No thanks, man.
Really? l thought you're
a big movie star and shit.
- Nah.
- Well, then, here.
Eat this.
Welcome home.
Guess l'll see you guys later.
Should we play a game?
Let's play ''Spin the Bottle.''
l'm not playing ''Spin the Bottle.''
How old are we?
More importantly, how old are they?
Oh, they're all legal... l think.
Well, we just ate all this fuckin' X,
so... what the hell else
are we supposed to do?
Girl has a point.
Fuckin' right.
l'm in!
Wait in line
Till your time
Ticking clock
Everyone stop
Everyone's saying
different things to me
Different things to me
Do you believe in what you see?
There doesn't seem to be anybody else
who agrees with me
Do you believe in what you see?
Motionless wheel
Nothing is real
Do you believe in what you see?
And I'll hide away for another day
Large!
Large!
Largeman, this is Dana.
- Hi.
- Hi. Who's up?
This is gonna be a good night.
Do you believe in what you see?
Everyone's saying
different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's saying
different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's saying
different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's saying
different things to me
Different things to me
lt's good, isn't it?
l always try to save a couple of
the marshmallows till the very end,
but l never make it.
l always end up with...
bunch of flake things and pink milk.
My mind wanders.
So, Tim...
...how long have you been
working at Medieval Times?
Three years, but l've only
been a knight for two.
You have to pay your dues.
l worked in the stables
and helped in the kitchen.
When l started,
he was making the coleslaw.
Hasn't been the same
since you got knighted.
l really just stirred it.
Don't be modest!
Mr. Modesty won the joust last night.
- Congratulations.
- lt's not that big a deal. lt's fixed.
What was it that happened
to you in high school?
You had a thing.
l forgot what it was.
- He got the shit kicked out of him.
- No, he didn't.
How do you know? He got the shit
kicked out of him by Tyrell Freeman.
- l fucked him up, too.
- He knocked your teeth out.
He only chipped one tooth.
So, what are you up to now, Mark?
You're digging graves?
Mark's gettin' into real estate.
- Tim can speak Klingon.
- What?
- No, l can't .
-Yes, you can.
- What the fuck is Klingon?
- Like the Star Trek guys?
- Yeah, he can speak their language!
- No, she's kidding.
No, l'm not.
Why are you being shy?
- Yeah, don't be shy, Tim.
- lt's just, it's made up.
This guy who plays the wizard
at work is a Trekkie. l don't--
Don't be shy.
Tell them what you said to me last night.
- No.
- Say what you said to her last night.
Kuntar petiki maya.
Al fuks su.
You got to be kidding me.
lt means, ''l like to mate after battle.''
- That's not what l said!
- Yes.
No, no. That wasn't the one l said.
This one means, ''Kill Kirk.''
And also, ''Hallelujah,''
depending on the context.
You must have gotten it confused with...
...plejit amor eke frek ize ka.
Ah! That is good!
You know what that means, Tim?
Well, l do.
lt means, ''Get the fuck out of my house
before l chop your fucking head off.''
Mark, he's a knight.
He's just a fast-food knight.
l should get going.
Thanks for the cereal.
l had a lovely evening.
By the way, it says ''balls'' on your face.
- Asshole.
- My mom did it.
In the spring.
the hungry gator must find new ...
...and clever ways to find food.
Did you tell Large about the tapes?
No, Mom.
l'm not doing those stupid tapes.
- What are the tapes?
- Real estate tapes.
You could make up to
$1 00,000 your first year.
You should have seen
the boat this Oriental guy had.
And he even had his own game show
in China, he had so much money.
l think Mark would be perfect at it.
Ma, shut up about those fuckin' tapes,
OK? lt's a scam.
Well, l'm doin' it.
l'm savin' up for those tapes.
Because l know what you could be
if you just apply yourself.
l do apply myself every day, Mom.
l work my ass off
burying dead people, OK?
l'm only 26. l'm not in any rush.
What's your rush for?
Just let me be.
l don't rush you.
OK, then l'll do 'em myself.
Fine, do 'em.
OK, then l won't let you on my yacht.
Except Large.
Large, you can come anytime you want.
Just don't bring your friend here.
Oh, shit.
Shit, l got to go to my meeting.
OK.
l love you.
- l love you, too.
- l love you.
- Large, it was nice to see you.
- Nice to see you, too.
Oh, oh, you guys.
Don't stay in here all day.
l took the batteries out of
the carbon monoxide detector.
lt was beeping all night.
She drives me crazy!
She gets all baked out and makes
me feel like l have to impress her.
And you know what? l'm OK with
being unimpressive. l sleep better.
- Hey, what time is it?
- No idea.
Oh, my-- l got to go.
Hi. l'm Andrew Largeman. l'm sorry,
l'm really late for my appointment.
Andrew, Andrew...
OK, Andrew.
l'm gonna need you to fill out
this paperwork for me, OK?
- As soon as we're ready, we'll call you.
- Thank you. l'm sorry.
lt's OK. Have a seat.
Hello, Miss Lubin.
- Oh, hello there.
- Have a seat. We'll be with you soon.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
How's it goin'?
Get off! Get off!
Heel.
Heel!
- Got any suggestions?
- What?
- You got any suggestions?
- Yeah, kick his balls.
Kick his balls.
Yeah, but l don't want to, like, destroy
future generations of charitable dogs.
Don't worry.
l got three Dobermans.
lf l don't kick them in the balls regularly,
l'd never get anything done.
But he's got to be close
to finishing by now.
Not yet. Here comes the lipstick.
- Mrs. Lubin?
- Yes?
- We're ready for you now.
- OK. Come on, Arthur.
l feel so used.
Thanks for your help,
or, at least, your good intentions.
- l recognize you.
- Oh, did you go to Columbia High?
No, not from high school. From TV.
Didn't you play the retarded quarterback?
- Yeah.
- Are you really retarded?
- No, l'm not.
- Cool.
Great job, man. l mean,
l thought you were really retarded.
You're just as good as that Corky kid,
and he's actually retarded.
lf there's some sort of retarded Oscar,
you would win hands down, kick his ass.
Well, thank you.
Thanks, l appreciate it.
l have to fill out this form, though, so...
- Right on.
- Thanks.
My cousin's an actor. Jake Ryan
Winters? Doubt you've ever heard of him.
He was, like, on X ena once,
as a gnome or something.
- That's really cool, though.
- Thanks.
Oh, my God!
That scene, that last scene where you
give the speech to the whole stadium.
And your dad-- Oh!
And your dad gives you the thumbs-up!
That was, like... that was emotional.
So, you got anything else coming out?
No, you know.
l'm just, l'm auditioning--
l can't believe you're not really retarded!
Jake's not a very good actor.
You can't really tell on X ena, 'cause he's
in the hairy gnome suit and everything,
but when we were little, he used to
put on these really low-budg renditions
of Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals
in our attic, and they were awful!
Like, so bad. Aah!
lt sucks, though, 'cause there's not that
much work for little people, you know.
Anyway, l've been talking too much.
l'll just--
You got to fill out your forms.
What are you listening to?
- The Shins. You know 'em?
- No.
You got to hear this one song.
lt'll change your life, l swear.
Oh, l'm sorry. You have to--
You got to fill out your forms.
Conundrum!
Think you could maybe listen while--
- l think l can handle it.
- Yeah? OK.
Gold teeth and a curse for this town
Were all in my mouth
Only. I don't know how
they got out. dear
Turn me back into the pet...
lt's good. l like it.
- So, what are you here for?
- What are you here for?
Waiting for a friend. You?
- l, uh--
- Oh, fuck, that was nosy. l'm sorry.
Ugh. l am, l am so nosy.
l didn't, l didn't mean to be-- l'm sorry.
No, just, l get these headaches.
l just want to have it checked out.
Cool.
- Andrew Largeman?
- Yes?
- We're ready for you now.
- Oh, OK.
- Thank you. Nice meeting you.
- You didn't. l'm Sam.
- Andrew.
- Nice to meet you.
- Good luck with your head.
- Thanks.
Don't worry, Sam.
We'll be with you next.
- Mr. Andrew Largeman?
- Yes, hi.
- There's nothing wrong with you.
- What?
Just kidding.
How would l know that?
Uh...
l'm Dr. Cohen.
What can we do for you today, Andrew?
l've been getting these
really intense headaches.
Um, they last for, like, a split second.
lt's like lightening. lt's like a surge
of electricity, and then it's gone.
Lithium?
How long have you been on the lithium?
Um, l've been on some form of it
since l was ten or so.
And the Paxil, Zoloft,
Celexa... Depakote?
Did they help you at all?
No.
l mean, l don't know.
lt's recently occurred to me
l might not even have a problem.
Only, l'd never know it,
because as far back as l can remember,
l've been medicated.
l left them in L.A., though.
This is the first time l haven't had
medicine in my body for a long time.
Well, that stuff will leave your body pretty
fast. l could write you a prescription.
Actually, l was thinking
about taking a vacation.
Have you discussed this
with your psychiatrist?
Uh... well, my psychiatrist is my dad.
Yeah, so l think
he'd prefer me to stay on it.
He... likes to think it makes me happy.
You know, our bodies are capable
of doing some very funny things
when they're consumed
with stress and anxiety.
Uh...
l found my ex-best friend's
cufflinks in my wife's purse.
Hmm.
l couldn't get an erection
for year and a half... for example.
Wow. Um...
But, l don't really think that's it,
because l don't,
l don't really feel, like,
stressed or anxious at all.
Well, with all the lithium he's had you on,
it's amazing you can even hear me now.
Look, Andrew, first of all,
l think you do need to find a psychiatrist
that isn't your father.
That's something that should have been
remedied years ago. He knows better!
And secondly... l'm in no position
to comment on whether
you should stay on the meds or not,
'cause l don't know your story.
But my opinion , since you're paying for it,
is that yeah, those drugs may help you
as a means to an end.
But sooner or later,
if you're not in therapy,
whatever's going on in your mind will find
a way to peek its head out of the water.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you're all right.
You're alive.
Come on.
l'll take a look at you. Come.
l'll need you to take your shoes off.
l have to scratch your feet.
Godspeed all the bakers at dawn
May they all cut their thumbs
And bleed into their buns
till they melt away
I'm looking in on the good life
I might be doomed never to find
And if you'd 'a took to me. like
I'd 'a danced like
the queen of the eyesores
And the rest of our lives
would 'a fared well
So, why were you really there?
Charging. l'm a robot.
- Do you lie a lot?
- What do you consider a lot?
Enough for people to call you a liar.
- People call me lots of things.
- ls one of them ''liar''?
l could say no,
but how would you know l'm not lying?
l guess l could choose to trust you.
- You can do that?
- l can try.
Whose bike is that?
lt was my grandfather's.
lt was the only thing he left to anyone
in my family, and he left it to me.
And l like it.
So, this is the point in the conversation
where you ask me if l'd like a ride home.
- lt is?
- Yep.
Would you like a ride home?
Fine... but l'm not getting in that sidecar.
- Why not?
- Sidecars are for bitches.
Anyone who rides in that
is automatically your bitch.
Thus, l better ride on the back.
- Oh.
- Hold on tight.
OK, holdin'!
My hair's blowin' in the wind.
What, are you, like, a hand glider?
My boyfriend was gonna pick me up,
so l brought it, but then he couldn't.
What does he have,
one of those tandem things?
No, he drives a Ninja.
Goes way faster than this guy.
- What kind of helmet is that?
- You can wear it on a bike.
- How's your head?
- l should live through the day.
- Cool. Make a right here.
- All right.
- Are you doing anything right now?
- Can you elaborate on ''doing anything''?
lt's just, l know this guy, Jesse.
He bought this mansion right up here.
And he wants me to come visit him,
but l don't want to stay very long.
So, l was thinking, like, if you came, too,
l could just say l have to take you home
when l'm ready to go.
Wow. That's pretty damn
random of you, Andrew.
- Well...
- ''Nice to meet you. Can l use you?''
- lt's the Hollywood in you.
- No. Come on, it's not like that.
lt'll be fun, come on. l'll tell you what.
We can have, like, a signal.
Like, when you pull on your ear,
that's the code.
And l'll be like,
''Oh, l got to take her home.''
And then, then we'll go.
Can we have code names, too?
lf you want.
OK... but don't try and, like,
kidnap me or anything,
'cause my step uncle's a bounty hunter,
and he could have you tracked and killed.
You're such a liar.
Whoo!
OK, you ready?
l'll be fine. Am l the first boy
you've ever brought home?
No, but, um... l lied to you before when l
told you that my boyfriend drives a Ninja.
- He doesn't drive a bike?
- No, l don't have a boyfriend.
But, you know, he might drive a Ninja...
wherever he is.
Wow, we're off to a great start.
OK. So-So sometimes l lie.
l mean, l'm weird, man.
About random stuff, too.
l don't even know why l do it.
lt's like, it's like a tic. l mean, sometimes
l hear myself say something,
and then l think,
''Wow, that wasn't even remotely true.''
So, how do people know what's real?
Well, l always feel bad afterwards
and admit them when they're lies.
- Can you trust that?
- Open the door.
Kevin, down. Mom!
Come on, kick 'em in the balls.
Come on. Mom!
Everybody down.
Who wants to eat?
Do you want to eat?
Then get the fuck off him.
Go on, get out.
l'm so sorry.
We just don't have the time to train them.
- Who's got the time to train them?
- Mom.
- This is Andrew.
- Welcome, welcome.
- l'm sorry the place is a wreck. Honey?
- Mm-hmm?
l asked you to get the metal wheel
out of the hamster cage?
- l forgot.
- Well, you forgot, and now Jelly's dead.
Luckily, l got Peanut Butter out in time.
We have to get the only hamsters
on planet Earth
who can't figure out
a stupid hamster wheel.
There's a tin box on the kitchen counter.
You can do the honors.
l have to get to work.
- lt's nice to meet you. Andrew, right?
- Yes. Very nice to meet you.
Samantha, put the clothes
in the dryer and bury Jelly.
So, this is it.
- lt's nice.
- No, it's not.
Don't say that 'cause
you can't think of anything else.
l'm not, l'm not. lt's very cozy. You guys
are a little early on the tree, though.
Yeah, well, we never got around
to taking it down,
so when it got to be fall again,
we figured, just leave it up.
Oh, my God.
You're totally freaked out right now.
- You, like, can't wait to leave.
- l'm not, l'm not. l like it. lt's very nice.
- You want to see my room?
- Sure.
Hey. Titembay, this is my friend Andrew.
Andrew, this is my brother, Titembay.
- Hi, it's very nice to meet you.
- Oh, it's nice to meet you.
- l'm sorry about Jelly.
- Oh, that's OK.
l saved some mac and cheese for you.
lt's in the fridge.
Thank you.
Anyway... l'm late for class.
- lt's nice meeting you.
- Very nice to meet you.
See you later.
So, here we are.
lt's nothing fancy, but you know...
What?
Uh, it's Titembay, right?
Yeah, it's weird, huh?
You're, like, so freaked out right now.
You're running for the door. lt's OK.
You can go. Don't feel bad--
- Stop doing that.
- What?
The thing you just did. Don't do that.
l want to be here. lf l didn't, l wouldn't be.
Trust me, my family is way more
fucked up than yours, OK?
OK.
So... Titembay.
Yeah, he's my brother.
- ls he adopted, or...?
- Kind of.
My mom adopted him
from Sally Struthers years ago.
One of those ''For the cost
of a cup of coffee a day'' things.
Where she's like, ''How can you
sit there and not help the children?''
And we just couldn't sit there
and not help the children.
So, we start sending him, like,
pictures and letters and stuff for years,
but then l got really into ice skating,
so we sort of forgot about him.
Then one day... we get this phone call,
and it's Titembay.
He's at the dry cleaners
around the corner. And he's like,
''l'm at Rutgers. l live in the dorms,
but l'm used to living with my tribe,
so l'd rather live with a family.''
And he's been living with us ever since.
Wow.
l know. He's the most amazing guy.
You ought to hear some of his stories.
He struggled through so much
because he wanted to learn.
When l think of what he's accomplished,
l just, l just feel, like, lazy, you know?
He's studying criminal justice at Rutgers,
and when he was a baby, he was one of
those kids with the flies all over his face.
Wow.
l mean, it's a crazy story.
Yeah, l know. l mean,
that's a true story. l am not that good.
Ohh... this is Tickle.
What is Tickle?
Tickle's my favorite thing
in the whole world.
lt's all that's left of Nanny, my blanket.
- Tickle's all that remains.
- Mm-hmm.
- Was there, like, a hurricane?
- Shut up!
No, l mean...
l've had this since l was a baby.
lt's what they brought me
home in from the hospital.
- lt's like the Wailing Wall.
- What?
Oh, the Wailing Wall is, like, this...
lt's, like, the most holy place for Jews
to go and pray in lsrael.
lt's all that's left of this enormous temple
that was destroyed by the Romans.
- So you're, like, really Jewish.
- What?
You are, aren't you? You are.
l'm not. l mean, l'm Jewish,
but l'm not really Jewish.
l mean, l don't do anything Jewish.
l don't go to temple or anything, but l
don't know any Jews that go to temple.
The Jews l know, they go on one day.
lt's Yom Kippur, the Day of Repentance.
OK.
Did you know that most temples
are built with moveable walls,
so that on the one day of the year
when everyone comes to repent,
they can actually make
the room big enough to hold everyone?
l don't really believe in God.
- Just Tickle.
- Oh, l believe in Tickle.
- We're not gonna make out or anything.
- What?
l'm sorry. l just totally
ruined that moment, didn't l?
- lt's just, we're not gonna make out, OK?
- No, l hadn't planned on trying--
Oh, l am so lame.
That was, like, really--
l'm... l'm sorry. Forget l just said that.
l'm-- That was dumb.
You know what l do when l feel
completely unoriginal?
What?
Blah, blah, blah, blah, la!
l-l make a noise, or l do something
that no one has ever done before,
and then l can feel unique again,
even if it's only for, like, a second.
- So, no one's ever done that?
- No. Not in this spot, no.
You just witnessed a completely
original moment in human history.
- lt's refreshing. You should try it.
- No, thanks.
- Come on.
- No, l think that was good enough
- for the both of us.
- Come on! What are you, shy?
This is your one opportunity to do
something no one has ever done before,
that no one will copy again
throughout human existence.
And if nothing else,
you'll be remembered
as the one guy who ever did this -
this one thing.
Uh...
- How was that?
- Oh, l've done that one before.
So, l got to go bury this hamster
before the dogs eat him.
Wanna help? Hmm?
Stood beneath an orange sky
- Wow.
- Yeah.
- l mean, this is, uh--
- l know.
lt's not that we're bad pet owners.
lt's just, you know, we've had
so many of them over the years.
Besides, a lot of these are fish.
After you.
All right.
Sit down.
What are you thinking about?
- Now?
- Yeah.
- Right now?
- Yeah.
Right now, l was thinking l've been going
to a lot of these things lately.
- What, dates?
- Not dates.
This is a date?
This isn't a date.
Funerals.
Why? Who else died?
Oh, um...
That's why l'm home, actually.
l guess l haven't even told you that yet.
My mom just died.
God, that's weird
to say that out loud, but, uh...
My mom just died, and...
yeah, that's why l'm home.
l'm so sorry.
God, l'm so sorry.
And here l am, putting you
through another one of these.
Not that Jelly's anywhere near your mom.
l mean, we loved Jelly, but...
- l'm so sorry.
- No, it's OK. lt's all right.
l'm all right with it.
Anyway, l think it's
what she wanted, so...
How did she die?
She drowned, actually.
Yeah, my mother was a paraplegic.
She was in a wheelchair,
so she... you know.
And... l guess she was taking a bath,
and she must have slipped or something.
That's what they say.
l don't know.
But, needless to say, she drowned,
and that's how she... she died.
When?
This was, uh...
...Sunday.
Oh, my God.
Why are you crying?
l don't know. l'm sorry.
l'm not usually like this.
lt's just, like...
lt's just so sad.
You know, it's like...
lt's so tragic, isn't it? lt is.
l mean, it's like, it's like real-life tragedy
or something. l mean...
Anyway, let's just,
let's change the subject, OK?
Let's really bring
the focus back to Jelly,
'cause what could be ruder than talking
about someone else who died
when you're in the act
of burying a close friend?
- Well, what should we do?
- l don't know.
l've only been to one of these things.
You appear to be the expert.
Well, we usually say something.
OK, l'll go first. Um...
Didn't really know you, Jelly.
From what l hear, you were a good pet.
- Little trouble with the wheel--
- That's not funny.
Jelly, you were a great pet.
l'm sorry l forgot to take
the wheel out of your cage.
l'm so, so sorry about that.
Goodbye.
l hope that you liked me.
If I lived
Till I was 1 02
I just don't think I'll ever
Get over you
Holy shit! You scared the shit out of me.
Why are you always doing that?
- l haven't seen you in a while.
- l've been catching up with people here--
Dr. Cohen called.
There's nothing wrong with you.
Yeah, l think l'm starting
to figure that out myself.
- When are you thinking of leaving?
- Uh, probably tomorrow.
Um... you know, l got a lot of stuff
l got to take care of in L.A.
- Probably have to find a new job, so--
- We need to talk.
Yeah. How?
l mean, when?
What are you doing now?
Now's not good, 'cause l told my friend
Mark l was gonna meet up with him.
But how about, like, later tonight?
- OK, then, we'll talk.
- Yeah.
We owe that to each other.
Yeah.
We owe it to her.
Yeah.
Good.
Sorry l scared you.
How could you leave all that lithium?
l was totally gonna
hit you up for some, man.
This fucking guy.
l'm glad you're back, man.
'Cause this town is so messed up.
Everyone's got their drug of choice.
lt's like in Brave New World.
You ever read that book?
Who wrote that? Aldous...
Aldous something. Aldous...
Anyway, there's, like,
Alphas and Betas and Epsilons
and all sorts of people...
Huxtable.
Aldous Huxtable.
That's it, bro.
Andrew, would you like to see
Sam's ice-skating tape?
- Mom, no.
- Absolutely.
She was so ahead of her time.
She could have gone to the Olympics.
No, no, no, no.
l couldn't have.
Yes, you could've. Don't blame it
on the epilepsy. You had a gift.
Come on, let me see it.
Let's show him the ''Florida Stars
of the lce'' opening. The gator costume.
- Mom, l'm asking you seriously.
- Oh, come on. Don't be shy.
- Let me see it.
- Oh, she wants you to see it.
How could you not want him
to see how talented you are?
- Were.
- Come on.
- Come on.
- Ugh.
- Honey, what are you doing?
- l'm dusting for prints.
Could we move
the crime scene into the kitchen?
l want to show Andrew Sam's skating.
Someone's pissing on my GameCube,
and l'm about to close the case.
- lt wasn't me, Your Honor.
- Paw prints point to a canine. Hmm.
Andrew, sit down here on the couch.
l can't believe you're showing him this.
Look, there she is.
- You're the alligator?
- You can tell by the hands.
Here comes the double axel.
And... land.
- Oh, l mean, come on. ls she good?
- Wow! She's great.
All right.
- Wow.
- Shut up.
No, l mean, your mom's right.
You're really good.
This was awesome, but we got to go.
l just wanted to show him how talented--
- Mom, come on!
- My baby!
All right, go on.
Go on, get away.
Wait a minute.
Give me a hug.
l love you so much.
l'm so proud of you.
- l love you, too.
- Have a good night.
- Thanks for dinner.
- Come, you're giving me a hug, too.
- Mom, come on.
- l'll take a hug.
- Good night. See you later, Tim.
- Bye, Tim.
Peace out, player.
It was the only thing
I ever liked doing.
pretending to be someone else.
l've been so out of it, the only parts l get
offered are playing handicapped people.
- That is not funny.
- Come on, you got to see that's a joke.
lf you can't laugh at yourself, life's gonna
seem a whole lot longer than you'd like.
All right, so, what are we
laughing at you about?
Mmm...
l lied again.
l have epilepsy.
Which part are we laughing about?
l, um...
l had a seizure
at the law office where l work.
Their insurance wouldn't cover me
unless l wore preventative covering.
- What's preventative covering?
- The helmet l was wearing.
Oh, come on!
That's funny.
That's really funny. l'm the only person
who wears a helmet to work
who isn't, like, putting out fires
or, like, racing for NASCAR.
But what do you do?
l mean, l can't quit.
Their insurance is amazing.
What do you do?
You laugh, you know?
l'm not saying l don't cry.
But in between... l laugh.
And l realize how silly it is
to take anything too seriously.
Plus, l look forward to a good cry.
Feels pretty good.
l haven't cried since l was a little kid.
l didn't cry at my mother's funeral.
l tried, you know?
l thought of all the saddest things
l could think of, like things in movies...
There's this image from Life magazine
that's always haunted me,
and l just, l focused in on it, you know?
But nothing came.
That actually made me
sadder than anything,
- the fact that l just felt so numb.
- What do you mean?
- Just that--
- Hey, vagina!
Hey, what's up, guys?
Uh, Sam, that's Mark, Dave,
and you remember Jesse.
- What's up?
- Hey, nice to meet you.
l'm sorry l said ''vagina'' just now.
l didn't know you were here.
- Oh, that's OK.
- Nice.
Let's get fucked up.
One, two, three! Whoo!
What are you doing?
Largeman, get the fuck in the pool.
lt's so warm!
Can you swim?
Of course l can swim.
Dude, maybe you should stay
on the steps. l don't know CPR.
You look like a wet beaver.
There's a handful of normal kid things
I kind of missed.
There's a handful of normal
kid things I kind of wish I'd missed.
You know that point
in your life when you realize
the house you grew up in
isn't really your home anymore?
All of a sudden, even though you have
someplace where you put your shit,
that idea of home is gone.
l still feel at home in my house.
You'll see. When you move out, it just
sort of happens. One day, it's gone.
And you feel like
you can never get it back.
lt's like you feel homesick
for a place that doesn't even exist.
Or maybe it's like this
rite of passage, you know?
You'll never have
that feeling again until you create
a new idea of ''home''
for yourself, you know?
For your kids, for the family you start.
lt's like a cycle or something.
l don't know, but l miss
the idea of it, you know?
Maybe that's all a family really is...
...a group of people who miss
the same imaginary place.
Maybe.
Are you ready? Whoo!
How about some fuckin' furniture, dude?
l bought a chair,
but l didn't like it.
- Where is it?
- lt's keeping us warm.
Silent Velcro.
You lucky motherfucker.
l feel like if l'd shown up at school
and presented the idea of silent Velcro,
they would've sent me away
a whole lot sooner.
- Why did they send you away?
- Ooh, listen to this girl.
- They didn't send me away.
- You just said they sent you away.
They sent me away.
They sent me to boarding school.
''Sent me away'' sounds like l went
to some asylum. There were no straps.
Why did they send you
to boarding school?
They sent me to boarding school
because they thought
l might be dangerous.
''You're so freaked out. You're running for
the door. You can go. Don't feel bad.''
That's really funny.
That's really funny.
Why would they think
you'd be dangerous?
- You're like a little detective.
- Well...
- Yeah?
- You're gay.
No.
Drum roll.
l was the reason
she was in a wheelchair.
l pushed her.
So, there that is.
- Shut up.
- Fuck off.
No, it's the truth.
Why?
Just a complete
freak accident, you know?
One of those things
you replay a million times,
and you see how clearly
it was just a complete freak thing.
l mean, my whole life,
she was depressed for no reason.
And one day, you know -
l was a little kid. l was nine years old -
and l just hated her for that,
and l pushed her.
And it was innocent. l was just
completely frustrated, because--
- Because you couldn't make her happy?
- Yeah. Fuck, yeah.
And-And any other time,
you know, any other day,
she would've yelled at me
and sent me to my room.
But this day,
on this particular day,
the door of the dishwasher...
had fallen open.
The latch on it was broken,
and it would just randomly fall open.
That fucking latch, you know...
lt's-lt's really amazing how much
of my life has been determined
by a quarter-inch piece of plastic, but...
So, anyway,
she-she fell back over the door
and hit her neck on the kitchen counter,
paralyzing her from the waist down.
Wow.
Still want to compare fucked-up families?
But your mom was in
the wheelchair long before you left.
Yeah. Well, l was nine.
So, they sent me to therapy
and put me on these drugs
that were supposed to curb my anger.
And l've been on some
form of them since.
And when l was 1 6, my psychiatrist dad
came around to the conclusion
that it probably wasn't the best
environment for me to be in.
So, he sent me to boarding school,
and l haven't been home since.
- Until now.
- For her funeral.
Until now, for her funeral.
l can't believe the retarded
quarterback's a pill popper.
Jesse?
Where's the sauna?
- l'll show her.
- No, l got it.
No, you get her a towel.
Want a ride, sweetheart?
- You're in it right now, aren't you?
- What do you mean?
My mom always says that when l'm
working something out in my head.
She's like, ''You're in it right now.''
And l'm looking at you,
and you're telling me this story,
and... you're definitely in it right now.
l think you're right.
l am in it.
Yeah, whatever.
Could we just change the subject, OK?
Let's just talk about good stuff.
Good stuff?
Like ''glass half full'' shit.
What do you got?
Got a little buzz.
l got that.
- What you got?
- l got a little buzz goin'.
And l like you.
So, there's that.
l guess l have that.
l can tap dance.
You want to see me tap dance?
l would love to see you tap dance.
So what if you catch me.
where would we land?
In somebody's life for taking his hands
See. I can tell
What are you doing?
You collect Desert Storm trading cards?
Fuck, yeah.
Those things are collector's items, man.
You have any idea how much
those are gonna be worth?
- Really?
- Hell, yeah. That shit's an investment.
l have lots of investments all over.
One day l'm gonna sell all of them,
and just fuckin' live off of it.
So, like, how much is this one worth?
- Which?
- ''Night Vision Goggles.''
l don't know. Mint?
Two, maybe three.
- Dollars?
- Yeah.
lt's too early. You don't sell yet.
Don't you know anything about investing?
l'm gonna live off that shit.
lf you have a complete set,
it's worth, like, thousands.
So, do you have the complete set?
Almost. The corners are bent
on my ''Friendly Fire,''
and someone stole my ''Wolf Blitzer.''
Now, look. What do you got to do today?
'Cause, uh... l got you
a little going-away present,
but, uh... l got to kinda track it down first.
- So, can you give me a ride?
- Uh, yeah. l just...
What?
- No, nothing. l just...
- Say it, speak.
l kind of told Sam l was gonna
hang out with her today, so...
She can come.
l don't care.
I could have been a sailor
Could have been a cook
A real live lover
Could have been a book
I could have been a signpost
Could have been a clock
As simple as a kettle
Steady as a rock
I could be here and now
I would be. I should be.
but how ?
l can't believe
we're in fuckin' Handi-World.
We're getting money.
Don't look guilty.
- How do l look guilty?
- Andrew Largeman?
- Oh, no. Benson.
- Oh, no.
- Who's that?
- Don't give him your number.
Hey, man, what's up?
- Holy shit!
- How's it going?
l haven't seen you since, like, junior year.
l thought you killed yourself.
What?
l thought you killed yourself.
That wasn't you?
No, no. That wasn't me.
Who killed themselves?
That was the Gleason kid.
Oh, and Tina.
- Tina who?
- You remember Tina.
She was anorexic, did gymnastics...
- Oh, gymnastics Tina? How'd she do it?
- l don't know.
- She wasn't Jewish. l didn't bury her.
- l think it was sleeping pills.
Or that car-in-the-garage thing. l forgot.
Oh, sorry.
This is Sam, Karl. Karl, Sam.
- Hey.
- Hey.
l got to go find that thing.
You stay here. l'll be back.
ls-ls it heavy, or...? OK.
Weren't you on a TV show or something?
Yeah, it was just this, just this show.
So you're, like, working here?
That's cool.
Only for a little while.
l'm opening my own business.
Actually, l should talk to you about it.
l'm looking for smart people like you,
Large. l should get your number.
Yeah, definitely.
That'd be, that'd be cool.
l'd like to talk to you - both -
about a good opportunity
for you and your loved ones.
We all have dreams.
l know l do.
l'd like to talk to you about an exciting
opportunity that people are talking about.
- We got to get going.
- Oh, OK. lt was good to see you, Karl.
- l should get your number.
- Definitely. l'll call you,
- 'cause l think he has it in his book.
- Nice to meet you.
Why is it always the losers that
get caught up in the pyramid schemes?
Why can't it be some charming, hot girl
nagging you incessantly to buy shit?
- ls that what he's doing?
- Yeah, it's detergent or some shit.
Why are you buying knives?
l don't need knives.
- l'd like to return these.
- You got a receipt?
Actually, no.
They were a gift.
- Why are you returning these?
- They're not sharp enough.
- They're not sharp enough?
- No, not for what we need them for.
They couldn't cut cans.
You bought them to cut cans?
No, but in the commercial it said
if l wanted to cut cans, l could.
- But with these knives, l can't.
- Well, it comes with a sharpener.
- Did you try it?
- Yeah.
They're just...
l don't want them.
They're not sharp enough.
OK.
A major loophole
in the Handi-World return policy
is that they permit returns
without receipts on items below $40.
So, how often do you go?
l hit every employee once,
and then l wait till they hire new ones.
Luckily, nobody stays at Handi-World
very long, except Karl Benson.
Mark, it's my last day in town. lf you
need money, l could loan you some--
l don't need your money.
l'm making my own.
Take Jesse's.
The guy's a millionaire.
l don't take anybody's money, OK?
l make my own. Favors are bad news.
The only thing worse than a favor
is a favor involving money, OK?
Let's go. l got to see a guy
about a nitrous tank.
Too low to find my way
Too high to wonder why
I've touched this place before
Somewhere in another time
Now I can hear the sun
The clouds drifting through the blinds
A half a million thoughts
Are flowing through my mind
What is this place?
l think you can see into hotel rooms.
Come on, tough guy!
Come on, tough guy!
Shut up!
Yeah. Oh. oh! Yeah!
l'm gonna fucking cum!
That shit was hot.
That shit was hot.
l got to go drop some knowledge
on that ho right there.
- How do you know she's a hooker?
- Of course she's a fuckin' hooker.
Girls who look like her
do not fuck guys that look like him
unless it's for coke, money, or fame.
Well, Julia Roberts married Lyle Lovett.
- Who the fuck are you?
- This is Sam, this is Large.
No offense, man, but why you
bringing these fucking people here?
This is the guy who needs that thing.
l brought you the tank, 'K?
Could you just tell us where to go now?
- That thing come with balloons?
- What am l, a fucking birthday clown?
No, it doesn't come with balloons, OK?
Suck it off the tap.
And l need it back,
'cause that guy's holding my 39 bucks.
All right, hold up. Hold up!
Who here just saw some titties?
Raise your hand
if you just saw some titties.
Hmm?
Thank you.
So everybody, just calm the fuck down.
Now... you know where
Kiernan's Quarry is?
- Down in Newark. right?
- Yeah.
It's at the bottom
of Hillside and Rivington.
Can't really see it from the street.
but it's there.
Park your car at the gate
and hop the fence.
At the bottom of the quarry. there's
a junkyard run by this guy named Albert.
He's the one that tracked down
the piece you're looking for. all right?
I'll call him right now
and tell him to expect you.
OK, stop.
- What the fuck are we doing?
- Just be patient, man.
We've been patient all day,
but it's my last day in town.
lf you told me we're going on scavenger
hunt for blow, l would've passed.
Please. lf l was gonna get you coke,
we would've gone
to the high school football practice.
We'd have been rolling five hours ago.
We've corrupted
this innocent girl enough.
- l'm not innocent.
- You are. That's what l like about you.
l don't want this guy taking you to some
sketchy quarry in the middle of nowhere
to find, like, crack whores
huffing turpentine
or pit bulls raping each other,
or whatever it is you have us doing.
Wow. That's, like, the most worked up
l've ever seen you.
- He was protecting me.
- So?
- He likes me.
- Don't be cute.
He's my knight in shining armor.
Don't talk about knights in front of Mark.
lt's a sore subject.
l'm gonna kill that motherfucker.
Pun intended?
Oh, you're--
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, my God.
- Wow.
- l never even knew this was here.
l've heard about it.
They were supposed to build a mall here.
l remember reading about that
in the paper.
They were digging or something, and
they break into this natural phenomenon.
lt's like an underground
Grand Canyon or something.
Now they're in some huge legal battle
over whether they can build here.
Can you imagine the guy
whose job it is to fight for his right
to build a mall on some, like,
geological phenomenon?
They love their malls here, man. All right,
let's find this guy and get out of here.
You're not gonna tell us
what we're getting?
- lt's a surprise. You'll see.
- l think it's gonna rain.
So, this is it.
So, knock. Knock and barter
for Desert Storm trading cards.
Don't tease me about my hobbies.
l don't tease you about being an asshole.
OK.
- Mark?
- Yeah. Albert?
Come on in.
Oh, man. You guys must be freezing.
Make yourselves warm by the fire.
l'm just gonna go put her down, OK?
l'll be right back out.
l must say... l'm continually impressed
with how each place you bring us to
- continues to be weirder and weirder.
- What do you mean? This is nice.
Oh, nothing. Just hanging out in an old
boat at the bottom of a quarry in Newark.
lt's hardly the bottom, dude.
Did you check out that cliff down there?
Hey... this is my wife, Faye.
Hi. Welcome.
Please, have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.
- Man, it's really coming down out there.
- Yeah, it started pouring all of a sudden.
Well, in a bad storm, l like to pretend
that this old boat's my own private ark.
Unfortunately, if this is the apocalypse,
l'm not quite sure it still floats.
- Listen, would anybody like some tea?
- l'd love some, thank you.
Do you want some tea?
OK, l'll be right back.
What is this place?
What is it that you do down here?
Well, we're calling it Kiernan's Fault.
No one knows what it is.
We haven't been able to explore it.
Meanwhile, while they're in litigation,
they hired me to make sure
no one comes inside.
Wow.
But what they don't know
is that at night, l climb down.
So how deep does it go?
Thank you.
You know - thank you -
no one really knows.
But l like to pretend it's infinite.
lt's kind of an odd job -
guardian of an infinite abyss.
Yeah. Yeah, l guess it is.
But we also trade
and deal in antique jewelry.
l suppose it is odd
that we live down here like this.
- Not at all.
- lt never crossed my mind.
Well... we think it's important.
Why? What is it that
you think you're gonna find?
l guess l just like the idea
of discovering something -
of doing something that's completely
unique, that's never been done before.
- Albert's Abyss.
- Well, maybe. Who knows?
But you know what? That's all ego.
None of that really matters.
lf l get to be with this person right here,
and our beautiful baby...
...that's all l need.
Well, l suppose you want what you
came all the way down here for.
Oh, yeah.
That'd be great.
Now, it took me a while to track
this piece down, but l owe Diego huge.
That's it.
Thank you so much.
- Yeah.
- Really.
Listen, good luck in the rain. Do you guys
want some garbage bags or something?
- Yeah.
- OK. That actually would be great.
Tom. get your plane right on time
I know your part'll go fine
Goodbye!
- Hey, Albert!
- Yeah?
Good luck exploring the infinite abyss.
Thank you. Hey!
You, too.
I get the news.
I need on the weather report
Oh. I can gather all the news I need
on the weather report
Hey. I've got nothing
to do today but smile
Da-do da-do doo-da.
and here I am
The only living boy in New York
Half of the time we're gone
but we don't know where
And we don't know where
Here I am
Whoo!
Half of the time we're gone
but we don't know where
And we don't know where
Tom. get your plane right on time
I know that you've
been eager to fly. now
Hey. let your honesty
shine. shine. shine. now
Da-do da-do doo-da doo-da
Like it shines on me
The only living boy in New York
The only living boy in New York
So... l don't know
if l'm gonna see you, man.
Don't you want to know
what's in the bag?
To be honest,
l don't even care anymore.
What is it?
lt's my mom's favorite necklace.
l'd be lying to you if l told you
it was my plan all along.
But... l got it back to you, right?
That's got to be worth something.
This whole day was about this?
You didn't want it down there with her.
lt's better it's with you.
OK.
Hey, if you ever need a Kato,
you know where to find me.
lt's funny, this...
This necklace reminds me of this really
random memory of my mother.
l was, l was a little kid, and l was crying
for one reason or another, and...
...she was just, like, you know, cradling
me and rocking me back and forth.
l can remember seeing
the little balls in this thing
just sort of floating back and forth, and...
And there was just, like, snot
dripping down my nose, right?
And, uh...
she gave me her sleeve...
...and she told me
to blow my nose into it.
And l remember thinking,
even as a little kid,
''Wow.
This is love.''
This is love.
Large.
- l think l see one.
- Shut up.
Yeah, l do.
Wait, we should save it or something.
OK, don't move. OK.
We could put it in my scrapbook,
if l had a scrapbook.
- That it?
- l think so.
l don't really feel any more coming.
Well, if you do, just let me know.
l'll get the cup, OK?
This was such a good idea.
- Who are you?
- l'm your new friend, Sam.
Tissue?
Come here.
Fuck, this hurts so much.
Yeah, l know.
But that is life.
lf nothing else, that's life, you know?
lt's real.
Sometimes it fuckin' hurts.
To be honest, it's sort of all we have.
Hmm.
How are you feelin'?
Safe.
When l'm with you, l feel so safe.
Like l'm home.
They will see us waving
From such great heights
''Come down now . ''
They'll say
But everything looks perfect
From far away...
- Dad.
- Yeah.
Ha.
Come on in.
- l'm sorry l woke you up.
- No, no. l was just reading.
Where have you been?
Everywhere.
l've been on sort of a crazy journey
these last couple days.
You've been avoiding me.
No, l haven't been.
Come on.
OK, maybe l have been.
l'm sure you can find
lots of things in your life
that you can be angry about.
But what l do not understand
is why you're so angry at me.
All l ever wanted was
for everyone to be happy again.
- That's all l ever wanted.
- When were we all ever happy, Dad?
You always say that.
l mean, when was that?
What was this time that we were all so
happy? l don't have it in my memory.
Maybe if l did, l could help
steer us back there, but l just...
You know, you and l need to work on
being OK, if that's not in the cards for us.
Well, we might have a shot at it, if you
can forgive yourself for what you did.
What l did.
What l did.
OK. Let's do it, OK?
We're here, right?
Let's do it. l'm gonna forgive myself
for what l did. Are you ready?
l was a little boy,
and somebody made a shitty latch.
That's what l think
about the whole thing, OK?
And l'm not gonna take those drugs
anymore. They left me numb.
l have felt so fucking numb to everything
l've experienced in my life, OK?
And for that...
...for that l'm here to forgive you.
You've always said all you wanted was
for us to have whatever it is we wanted.
Well, maybe what Mom wanted more
than anything was for it to all be over.
And for me... what l want more
than anything in the world
is for it to be OK with you
for me to feel something again...
...even if it's pain.
Going against
your doctor's recommendation
is a pretty weighty experiment
to take on, don't you think?
This is my life, Dad.
This is it.
l've spent 26 years waiting
for something else to start.
So, no. l don't think it's too much to take
on, because it's everything there is.
l see now it's all there is.
You and l are gonna be OK.
You know that, right?
We may not be as happy as you
always dreamed we would be, but...
...for the first time,
let's just allow ourselves
to be whatever it is that we are.
And that will be better, OK?
l think that will be better.
What are you thinking about?
You're not coming back, are you?
- Come on, Sam. Of course l am.
- No, you're not.
You don't realize this is good.
This doesn't happen often in your life,
you know?
l mean, this...
We can work this stuff out.
l want to help you, you know?
We need each other.
l haven't even lied in, like, two days.
ls that true?
No.
Look, this isn't, this isn't a conversation
about this being over.
lt's-lt's... l'm not, like, putting a period
at the end of this, you know?
l'm putting, like, an ellipsis on it.
'Cause l'm worried that
if l don't go figure myself out,
if l don't go land on my own two feet,
then l'm just gonna fuck this whole
thing up, and this is too important.
l got to go.
l... l got to go.
l fired my psychiatrist.
l got to go find a new one.
Look, l'm gonna call you
when l get there.
l'm gonna call you, and...
Look at me.
Look at me.
You changed my life.
You changed my life,
and l've known you four days.
This is the beginning
of something really big.
But right now, l've got to go.
Come here.
Drink up. baby. down
Mmm. are you in or are you out?
Leave your things behind
'Cause it's all going off without you
Excuse me.
too busy writing your tragedy
These mishaps you bubble wrap
When you've no idea what you're like
Take your seats as quickly as possible.
- What are you doing?
- Do you remember that idea l had
about working stuff out,
then finding you once l figured stuff out?
- The ellipsis?
- Yeah, the ellipsis. lt's dumb.
lt's an awful idea,
and l'm not gonna do it, OK?
'Cause like you said, this is it.
This is life.
And l'm in love with you, Samantha.
l think that's the only thing l've ever
been really sure of in my entire life.
l'm really messed up right now,
and l've got a lot of stuff to work out,
but l don't want to waste any more
of my life without you in it, OK?
- Yeah.
- And l think l can do this. l want to.
- We have to, right?
- Yeah.
- Right?
- Yes!
So, what do we do?
What do we do?
So. let go
So. let go. jump in
Oh. well. whatcha waiting for?
It's all right
'Cause there's
beauty in the breakdown
So. let go
Let go. just get in
Oh. it's so amazing here
It's all right
'Cause there's
beauty in the breakdown
It gains the more it gives
And it rises with the fall
So. hand me that remote
Can't you see
that all that stuff's a sideshow ?
Such boundless pleasure
We've no time for later now
You can't await your own arrival
You've 20 seconds to comply
So. let go
So. let go. jump in
Oh. well. whatcha waiting for?
It's all right
'Cause there's
beauty in the breakdown
So. let go
Let go. just get in

Mmm. breakdown
So amazing here
'Cause there's beauty
in the breakdown
Well. the rain
Keeps on coming down
It feels like a flood in my head
And that road
Keeps on calling me
Screaming to everything lying ahead
And it's a winding road
I've been walking for a long time
I still don't know where it goes
And it's a long way home
I've been searching for a long time
I still have hope
I'm gonna find my way home
And I can see
A little house on top of the hill
And I can smell the ocean
The salt in the air
And I can see you
You're standing there.
and you're washing your car
And I can see California
Sun in your hair
And it's a winding road
I've been walking for a long time
Still don't know where it goes
And it's a long way home
I've been searching for a long time
Still have hope
I'm gonna find my way home
All these dreams took me so far
And I felt I just couldn't go on
And I want to hang
out the window of your car
And see just how good
this baby can run
'Cause it's a winding road
I've been walking for a long time
And I still don't know where it goes
And it's a long way home
I've been searching for a long time
Still have hope
We're gonna find our way home
It's a long way home
It's a long way home
It's a long way home
