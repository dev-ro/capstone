Good morning...
Today's top story
is the ozone layer.
It continues to disintegrate...
taking with it our protection
from the sun's rays.
White House today declared a
state of national emergency.
The President urged
all Americans to...
In Africa,...
where shelter from the sun
is almost non-existent...
the dead and dying
number in the millions.
Only a few months now...
until the ozone layer
is completely gone.
A team of international
scientist,...
led by Dr. Alan Neyman...
and supervised
by Connor MacLeod...
work around the clock.
This may be the last
chance for planet Earth.
They'll remember this day
for a thousand years.
The day we protected
the planet...
from the sun.
All personnel,
please leave the area.
We are standing
the final countdown.
All personnel,
please leave the area.
We are standing
the final countdown.
T.S.C., this is
Florida control.
All power for the Shield is...
All systems are go.
Please run final checks
on all Shield power amps.
All personnel,
please leave the area.
We are starting
the final countdown.
T.S.C., this is
Houston Space Control.
Satellite is in
final receiving position.
You can start final countdown.
Stand by... this is it.
Roger control.
We are standing by.
This is it !
Florida Control,
this is T.S.C...
December Shield Installation
is ready to receive.
To all power sources around
the world, this is T.S.C.
We are ready to receive.
Launch minus ten...
Ten seconds and counting.
Okay, let's make
this a good one.
The world is watching.
Four... three...
two... one...
ignition.
The Shield
25 years ago it was our Saviour
But now, no sun... no stars
Only heat and humidity
It drains the energy from the whole world
We're falling apart
Going backward
Old cars, old planes, old dreams
The cure is worse than the disease
Good evening
and welcome to TSC's nightly report
Today the Shield Corporation
the world's largest private company
was accused of monopoly
and price fixing
Alan Neyman, president of TSC
was unavailable for comment
At its regular monthly report
the Shield Corporation announced
record profits for its fiscal year
ending November 2024
And now for the weather
The temperature at 97
with humidity constant at 97
No rain, no clouds, no thunder
no lightning, no nothing
As usual under the Shield
Remember Highlander...
Remember your home.
Another galaxy.
You were chosen.
Remember ?
Yes.. Yes, I remember
The beginning... 500 years ago
On the planet Zeist
We planned rebellion
We met in secret
always careful to avoid
our deadly enemy
General Katana
Free men of the
planet Zeist, hear me.
You gather together in secret
for the last time.
You suffer under the yoke
of General Katana's rule.
for the last time.
You stand without a leader...
for the last time.
Will you lead us, Ramirez ?
No, I'm not your leader.
But because I see with eyes
different from yours...
I see a man...
with a great
destiny before him.
Who is he?
Show him to us.
Let him show himself.
Let him feel the Quickening !
Yes... you !
The ancient power of the
Quickening has joined us.
We are now as one.
How do we start ?
Not we. You.
And you start with Katana.
General Katana is attacking.
Break ranks, keep moving.
General Katana...
I want MacLeod. Find the
one they call Ramirez.
And what about the others ?
Kill them.
I want all their heads
So deadly in their
own environment
So tame and
so vile in mind
Maybe their just waiting
Waiting for what?
For you to get careless
Maybe they are
But as of tomorrow
waiting won't be an option
for you, will it?
You sure?
Leaders of the Rebellion,...
you have been found
guilty of treason.
We hereby sentence you
to exile from Zeist.
You'll be sent
to the planet Earth.
Once there,
you will be immortal.
You can only die if your head
is cut from your body.
When one of you becomes
the last of us on Earth...
receive or claim the Prize.
He can return to Zeist
or choose to grow
old and die on Earth...
Will we be together on earth ?
Not at first.
But we are joined in a way
that can never be broken.
Not even by death.
When you need me,...
you'll only have
to call my name.
I'll always find you.
If I win the Prize,
I'll be back.
Just remember. The Quickening !
It sounds like magic.
It is...
kind of.
Prepare yourselves.
There can be only one.
Okay, Mr. MacLeod,
the show is over.
I thought so too, Charley.
I really did.
Come on, Louise, let's do it.
Here it is.
We've got thirty seconds
to get a clear reading.
Impossible, radiation
levels can't be normal.
Blue Alert !
All right, come on, hurry up.
Check the oxygen !
Three zero point four four...
Run
Go, go, go
Shoot! Shoot!
Let's split up !
Hey, Jimmy...
Mr. MacLeod,...
how are you doing ?
Good... good.
All right... all right.
- Usquebaugh ? - Usquebaugh.
Here you go.
Reports have just come
in of a terrorist attack...
at the December Installation.
According to information
available at this time,...
the group calling themselves
COBALT successfully made...
an attempt to enter December
for propaganda purposes.
The Shield Corporation
had this to comment...
What COBALT is
doing is insanity !
Any tampering with
the Shield of any kind...
endangers the lives of every
man, woman and child on the planet.
COBALT is known to be headed
by environmental terrorist,...
Louise Marcus who led the raid
remains at large at this time.
Pretty girl
- You're a good boy, Jimmy.
- Well, bottoms up !
Hey, are you MacLeod ?
Hey, I asked you a question !
Are you MacLeod ?
Yes, I am.
Great
I always wanted to meet the guy
that turned the world to shit !
Well, he saved
our lives, if you ask me.
I'm not asking you.
Okay, what do you want ?
Did you ever think...
about that before you covered
the sky with that puke ?
Who are you ?
Me?
I'm nobody... alright?
I work all day and
my life stinks...
and it's your goddamn
fault, you old bastard.
Don't turn your back on me !
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Okay, Miss Nobody,
you're out of here !
Come on, come on.
- I'll see you again.
- Anytime.
Oh Jesus. Why do they
always pick my place ?
You know what I'm saying ?
- I'm sorry, Mr. MacLeod.
- No problem, Jimmy.
Watch out !
Son-of-a-bitch !
Are you all right ?
Yeah, I'll be fine.
You just hang in there, Mr.
MacLeod, I'll be right back.
Hey you, come back here !
I'm talking to you !
Mr. MacLeod ?
I'm Louise Marcus.
Terror is a dangerous
business, Miss Marcus.
I'm not a terrorist.
Whatever you are, Miss Marcus
you'll have to excuse me.
Good-bye, Miss Marcus.
You know, I used to
read about you.
You had such great
passion for the world.
I admired you.
I can see that's all gone now.
You're nothing but
a tired old man.
More than you know.
Oh no, you don't.
The world is dying, MacLeod.
I need your help.
Please get out of the car.
No way.
Suit yourself.
Listen MacLeod
When I broke into December
installation tonight...
the numbers and figures
I saw didn't add up.
Something's wrong and
Blake's trying to cover it up.
What do you want me to do ?
- Help me. - I can't.
Not now.
Look, I'm not making this up.
I used to work
for the Shield Corporation.
When I started asking
too many questions,
I was threatened then fired
I don't blame them.
Don't be such an asshole !
What happened to the MacLeod
everyone believed in ?
That was forty years ago.
Where are you?
You leave for the planet Earth
immediately
Find MacLeod and kill him
But I thought you said
MacLeod was mortal
and can never return
Find him for me.
Kill him.
So hard to get good help
Are you all right ?
What's the matter ?
- Who are they ?
- I don't know.
MacLeod
What was that,
just a lucky guess ?
Wait a minute,
what are we doing ?
Get in there and
don't make a sound !
In here?
- You gotta be kidding ?
- Come on !
- Let me have him.
- But I want him.
It's my turn.
MacLeod
You're going to die !
Ramirez !
My old friend,  Ramirez !
Thank you !
Time to say good-bye,
Highlander.
Why ? You going somewhere ?
Hey, you got a light ?
Ramirez !
Alas, poor Yorik !
I knew him, Horatio.
Alas, poor Yorik !
I knew him, Horatio.
Actually, the name is Ramirez.
Will you get out of here ?
Excuse me ?
A fellow of infinite jest...
of most excellent fancy.
Forgive me for interrupting
your conversation but...
He had borne me upon
his back... thousand times.
And now, how abhorred
in my imagination it is !
My gorge rises at it.
Here hung those lips that I
have kissed I know not how
Sir, whatever you gentlemen
felt for each other when...
your friend was still alive,
is none of my affair.
What's your
fucking game, shithead ?
Shithead ? What's a shithead ?
Get off the stage !
My apologies...
Enough of this useless banter.
I shall be on my way...
and leave you to converse
with your skull.
Farewell... dear shithead !
Farewell...
I'm rather glad
the magic works.
So much for the horse and cart.
Louise
Who are you ?
I'm Connor MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod.
I was banished from the planet,
Zeist, 500 years ago.
And I cannot die.
I'm Louise Marcus
from Flagstaff, Arizona.
Let me just see if
I can get this straight.
You come from another planet
and you're mortal there...
but you're immortal here...
until you kill all the guys
from there who have come here.
And then, you're mortal here.
Unless, you go back there...
or some more guys
from there come here...
in which case, you become
immortal here... again.
Something like that.
It would be something
like that, wouldn't it ?
- Quite a night !
- Tell me about it.
You think I do this
every Saturday night ?
Let's say it's a kind of magic.
That's not what
I was talking about.
So... what do you
want me to do ?
You built the Shield.
Maybe, you can figure out
what's going on up there.
What are you saying ?
Something is being
kept very, very quiet ?
Even your old pal,
Alan's on a tight leash.
I couldn't get anyone
to listen to me.
So you started COBALT.
Got your face on national T.V.
Why ?
Of course, somebody had
to get people's attention.
Start asking questions.
Find out the truth.
Someone like you ?
No... damn it !
Someone like you.
I can't even make a decent
cup of coffee anymore.
You always use too much water.
Mac,...
Alan
Where the hell have you been ?
So glad you're here
So many things have happened.
We must talk.
OK
Good God
You look fantastic !
You had a facelift?
Something like that
Good Heavens
Can you give me the secret?
I could really use it.
I need a favor.
A favor ?
You'll have
to talk to the sharks.
I'm only a little fish.
It's only a little favor.
Never mind that, Mac, you don't
know what's happened.
It's wonderful... come here...
Forgive me, Alan.
I didn't realize you got
in this early.
Not usually. But we
got to talking...
Forgive me. David Blake...
Connor MacLeod.
Ah yes. Of course.
I'm afraid I've
forgotten you were still alive.
Always !
Something on the computer ?
No, no, no, nothing
I won't remember.
Alan, as long as
we have you here,...
we might just as well,
get off to an early start.
- My office ? -All right.
MacLeod, I'm terribly sorry
to have to break this up...
but I trust you can
find your own way out.
Sure... take care
of yourself, Alan.
By the way, how is
the Shield business ?
It must be great to have every country
in the world as your customer.
We prefer to think that
we protect the population...
of the planet from death
by solar radiation.
It is a rather unique service.
Don't you agree ?
As long as it's necessary.
Meaning ?
Maybe, one day the ozone layer
will repair itself.
That would be a great day for
the human race, wouldn't it ?
But it really makes
no difference anymore...
since you built the Shield
to last forever.
Nothing... lasts forever.
I guess if you want
something done
You have to do it yourself
That was great !
Where the hell am I ?
This sure doesn't
look like Kansas...
does it ?
Nice material.
You're little, aren't you ?
Bet you've always wanted
to drive one of these.
Me too !
Give me more !
Let's have some fun !
Last stop !
It was all going to be so good
So clean
And for one brief moment..
it was
I used to wish you were
here to see it
But not anymore
Not after what it has become
What it's done to us
Bravo, Bravo, excellent
I always did admire a man
who could talk to the dead
Its so good to see you again MacLeod
The remains of your mortal wife
So frail
So earthy
So very dead
At least she's at peace
Peace is highly overrated
Things don't change, Katana
I like that
After all these years
You're still a jerk
You're not coming back to Zeist, MacLeod
I never planned to
What do you mean?
After all this time I was ready to
kick back, crawl and die
Then you sent those spunks down here
You changed everything
And now I'm back to square one
Immortal!  Again!
So Katana, let's see who goes back
to Zeist after all
I rather like this place.
It's got atmosphere
I just might stay
Get off!
Remember the golden rule Highlander
We must never fight on holy ground
And this .... is holy ground
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
If you don't take it out and use it
It's going to rust
Excellent threads, dude
Shithead
- May I help you, sir ?
- I would like a suit of clothes
And why not indeed !
We are the oldest
gentlemen's tailor in Scotland.
Well then, I've come
to the right place...
since I am without a doubt the
oldest gentlemen in Scotland.
Well, if you say so, sir
Well, let's get started
I have a long journey ahead
of me and limited time
I'm afraid, sir still
doesn't understand
A suit may take several
weeks to complete.
I'm afraid sir damn well
does understand
And sir would like his suit
of clothes by three o'clock
There's nothing
like a challenge...
to bring out the best in man
With our compliments, sir
Thank you, Roy
Can we arrange a
limo for you, sir ?
Limo?
Yes, to take
you to the airport
Airport?
You did say you had
a long journey ahead of you
Yes
I believe the fastest
way is still to fly
To fly ?
Yes, of course
Fly..
Good-bye, sir
Forgive me for
asking yet again but...
how do we remain so high
above the earth with safety ?
Welcome to your
Trans-Atlantic flight.
Please fasten your seat belts
In the unlikely event
of a loss of cabin pressure...
oxygen masks will
drop from the ceiling
Place it over your mouth
and nose and breath normally.
In case of fire
Please do not panic
Place smoke hood over your head
and crawl to your nearest exit.
Thank you for flying with
us and enjoy your flight
But on the contrary Virginia
all of the most beautiful
women had dark hair.
Helen of Troy,
Cleopatra, Nefertiti,
Joan of Arc,
to name but a few
In fact, it's well known that
the dark-haired ladies...
Would you like
to order something ?
Thank you.
May I have some water, please ?
Something else for you, sir ?
No, thank you. I never eat
anything I cannot identify.
That's not
exactly true of course.
On 3... Break!
Red 36, Blue 21
Hike! Hike! Hike!
Ship's log
The Rosemary
December 6 1858
My name's Jerry Pritchard, man
What do they call you ?
It's quite
comfortable back here...
rather like a coffin.
You're in the music
business, aren't you ?
Call it a hunch.
I knew that.
- Stop now!
- What, here ?
Now !
This is a good place to stop.
God-damn ! Whoa
Shit, F.....
I'll get out here.
Oh Wow! Yeah
out of control, you and
my sister, man, forget it
I should insist you two
sit around and compare tattoos.
or something
Man, You're crazy !
What's next, man ?
Central Control,
Jerry Pritchard
Shit,
I should've stayed in school.
Just take it easy, all right ?
Come on, come on.
Central ? Central ?
Shit, man
Put all this on my tab
And Jerry, add little
something for yourself.
Gentlemen...
as I believe you know...
there's been a bit of shuffling
of the deck here...
since yesterday.
As a result which can now
assure you that COBALT...
will no longer be a problem.
In fact, earlier today,
in our August installation...
the Shield Police were once again
able to stop an attempt at...
Hi...
Excuse me but I do believe
that you'll find the...
costume parade is located
in another building.
This happens to be a meeting
and no one interrupts...
a meeting of the Corporation.
The Corporation.
What luck !
You see I've come to
join your Corporation.
And here you all are
Where do I sign up ?
I think I've had enough of you.
Good-bye, Attila.
Yeah, Yes indeed
That was brilliantly done.
Yes...
You know guys
this is no way to treat your
number one draft choice.
Partners...
I believe you cannot run...
business without partners.
- This is a business, isn't it ?
- Yes, it is.
Ah
We like to think of it
as a good business.
Mmm.
What exactly is it
that you want...
partner?
Ahh.
The Highlander.
Right.
Please don't bother, Alan.
Every time you turn that thing on,
it just gets printed out in my office.
And yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
that includes your little
computer conversation
with MacLeod the other day.
Besides, what good
could you possible do, old man?
What do you mean?
Ho-oh, I don't know.
How about for starters,
that there simply
isn't enough energy on the planet
to take down the shield
without killing us all.
If I'm going too fast,
slow me down.
But I think you should
know this all, Alan.
I mean, you designed the thing.
You and this MacLeod.
But that was only in case
the shield was threatened.
Well, that's funny, Alan!
'Cause I was under the impression
that that's precisely
what had happened.
But it really doesn't matter
now, does it?
Why don't you and I try and relax.
No tears.
Because it's business as usual...
forever.
You've allowed yourself
to become a traitor, Alan.
And, as I think you know,
we have a fabulous
place for traitors
Who's the girl in the painting ?
That was Heather.
My first wife.
We lived in Scotland in 1542.
What was she like ?
Full of love.
Full of life... till the end.
I held her in my arms
when she died.
An old woman.
I still loved her.
And the other ?
That's Brenda. My last wife.
She was beautiful.
She was. She died
in New York, 29 years ago.
That's a long time to be alone.
You get used to it.
Do you really ?
No..
What is it ?
Oh no, not again.
Go upstairs.
Greetings, Highlander.
You called ?
Incredible !
What took you so long ?
They could've killed me.
Don't be ridiculous.
You've remembered almost
everything I taught you.
I've had a lot
of practice lately.
There is no substitute
for experience.
What experience ?
You've been dead for 500 years.
So
You watch it !
Watch what ?
Watch what ? The sculpture !
That's a sculpture ? Now,
you are being ridiculous.
Remember, MacLeod...
you called me.
- To magic. -To Zeist.
It's nice to see...
that some things have actually
improved over the years.
Is this private ?
Not necessarily.
This is Juan Sanchez
Villa Lobos Ramirez,...
my old friend and teacher...
visiting from Scotland.
Visiting most unexpectedly
from Scotland.
This is Louise Marcus.
Watch it, she's wanted
by the police.
I didn't realize the police
had such a good taste.
You two have known
each other for a...
long time ?
It seems like an eternity.
Are you also... ?
I'm afraid so.
MacLeod
You created that monstrosity ?
Why?
It was necessary at the time.
So was Noah's flood. But that
at least, served its purpose.
It cleansed the world of evil
and gave it a fresh start.
MacLeod!
Alan Neyman's been
taken to Max
Max?
Who's Max ?
It's a death sentence,
a high security prison.
MacLeod, until you honor
your obligations here...
you can't return
to Zeist. And Katana.
Katana is here.
Well it's the best news I've
heard since my resurrection.
Your time is now !
You have entered
a restricted area.
Please, identify
yourself immediately.
I am Juan Sanchez
Villa Lobos Ramirez
Chief metallurgist to King
Phillip the Second of Spain...
and I am at your service.
This is Checkpoint One outside
of Security Installation Max.
Identify yourself.
Take it easy, man,
first time in the desert.
Which way to Vegas ?
Hit it, MacLeod !
Get ready, here it comes.
Hi, you won't shoot me,
will you ? I mean...
Thank you. I was
just hitching a ride.
Then these two guys
grabbed me and... my...
and threw me
in the trunk and...
Shit !
I'm Dr. Sonny Jackson and
I looked over your report...
and as near as I can tell, you
have a few bruises and lacerations...
but I think you'll be
okay in a day or so.
Thanks. How about them ?
No way, they were both dead
before the car stopped.
I'm amazed they
got as far as they did.
Gosh, I've never
seen a mess like that.
They must've taken
about 100 bullets or so.
- A hundred and eight.
- One hundred and twelve, myself
Come on, you're not counting
that little scratch, are you ?
Scratch..What are you talking about ?
It passed right through me.
You just look at
my splendid waistcoat.
Wait a minute...
You guys are... you boys are...
You guys are... dead. Larry ?
All right, these tunnels run
along both sides of Max...
and they end up at the same place.
They both have security rooms
and Neyman's in one of them.
We should split up and we'll
meet back together at the end.
You take this way.
Let's go ! MacLeod
No more... no more.
Oh my God...
Mac is it you?
Listen...
We did right to build it,
didn't we ?
We did.
I won't forget you.
MacLeod
Well, like a high school
reunion down there.
It really makes
no difference now...
because, they're dead.
Don't let the door close !
The combination !
We need to know the right
sequence to open the door.
Holy shit !
Just stay back !
I can help !
No, you can't help this time.
Most people have
a full measure of life.
And most people just
watch it slowly drip away.
But if you can
summon it all up...
at one time...
in one place.
You can accomplish something...
glorious !
My time here is over.
You must go...
and search out Katana.
I'll take the power of you both
to destroy the Shield.
Will I ever see you again ?
Who knows, Highlander ?
Who knows?
Go...
Yes, it looks as though
you fucked up, hey partner ?
You really think so ?
Well...
Maybe...
Then again... maybe not.
I'm waiting..
Hi..
- Hi..
Showtime
Don't worry,
we're gonna be okay.
That's easy for you to say.
You don't have to worry
about getting killed.
We're gonna be okay.
Just hold them off.
Not bad
Nicely played, MacLeod
But the game's not over yet
That's very cute.
Come on !
There can be only one.
MacLeod
Remember Highlander
You've both still got
your full measure of life
Use it well
And your future will be glorious
