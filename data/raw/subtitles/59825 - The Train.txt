WE, THE MAKERS OF THIS FILM,
WISH TO PAY TRIBUTE
TO THOSE FRENCH RAILWAY MEN,
LIVING AND DEAD,
WHOSE MAGNIFICENT SPIRIT AND
COURAGE INSPIRED THIS STORY.
WE WISH ALSO
TO EXPRESS OUR THANKS
TO THE FRENCH NATIONAL RAILWAYS
AND THE FRENCH MILITARY FORCES,
WHOSE WHOLEHEARTED COOPERATION
MADE THIS PRODUCTION POSSIBLE.
Achtung
It was in the Clouvet collection, wasn't it?
It was.
- Do you like it?
- Need you ask?
This is degenerate art, you know.
As a loyal officer of the Third Reich,
I should detest it.
I've often wondered at
the curious conceit that would attempt
to determine tastes and ideas by decree.
Many times over the past four years
I have wanted to thank you.
For not being what you'd expected?
For saving all this. Protecting it.
Do you feel free to thank me now because
the liberation of Paris is so close?
Perhaps.
- It's not necessary.
- I could have been sent away.
Someone else brought in
to be in charge of the museum.
Perhaps I should thank you.
I was foolish.
I knew of books being burned.
Other things.
I was terrified that these would be lost.
A book is worth a few francs.
We Germans can afford to destroy those.
We all may not appreciate artistic merit,
but cash value is another matter.
You won't convince me
that you're cynical.
I know what these paintings mean to you.
You are a perceptive woman.
We're removing the paintings.
- Pack them carefully.
- Where are you taking them?
- To a safe place.
- But no place is as safe as Paris.
The city has been declared open.
It won't be bombed or shelled.
Captain.
I want these on the station tomorrow,
crated and ready to be put on the train.
- What about my train?
- It has been cancelled, sir.
- Who cancelled it?
- I did.
- Who are you?
- Labiche, Colonel. Area Inspector.
Under my supervision, of course.
Since when does a Frenchman have
the authority to cancel a German train?
We're making up a special armament
train, Colonel. Highest priority.
- Whose orders?
- Von Rundstedt.
Military Commander, Western Front.
How soon can my train
be cleared to leave?
As soon as I get another order.
It's your army, Colonel, not mine.
You'll get the order. Have the train ready
this afternoon at 3.30.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
I'm calling for General von Lubitz.
I want the line
for the Field Command Headquarters.
Yes, immediately!
Field Command Headquarters?
General von Lubitz's office calling.
Colonel Müller, please.
The general cancelled all appointments
not dealing with the evacuation of Paris.
- Is he in?
- Yes, Colonel,
but I have orders not to let anyone in...
- What is it, Colonel?
- A train I ordered was cancelled.
I've been advised your personal
authorisation is now required.
Signal from General von Rundstedt, sir.
The highway between Avranches and
Mortain has been cut by the Americans.
You can make application
through normal channels.
You once said
normal channels were a trap,
in which to snare officers
who lacked initiative.
What's your cargo?
I don't share your enthusiasm for art.
Even if I did, it would not
be centred on this degenerate trash.
Nor would I expect priority
over vitally needed war transport.
Good morning, Colonel.
The second SS armoured division
has fallen back towards Falaise.
Report on their remaining
effective strength.
Might it not be unwise to leave a billion
gold reichsmarks in the Bank of France?
Enough money
to equip ten panzer divisions?
Make your point, Colonel.
Money is a weapon.
The contents of that train are as
negotiable as gold, and more valuable.
I feel Berlin would prefer it
in the hands of the Third Reich.
If conditions at the front become more
critical, I will rescind this authorisation.
- When will you be ready?
- Tomorrow morning at 9.15, Major.
Come in. Come in.
This is Mademoiselle Villard
from the Jeu de Paume, the museum.
I brought her with me.
Mademoiselle Villard has a problem.
- I thought your group might help her.
- It's not to help me.
You understand?
The paintings belong to France.
- Paintings?
- The train you are preparing the colonel.
He's stealing a load of pictures.
You should hear what they're worth!
- It's not just the money.
- What does she want us to do?
- She wants us to blow up the train.
- Oh, no! No, you misunderstand.
They must not even be damaged.
They could never be replaced.
They're not just.... Here, I have the list.
Renoirs, Cézannes,
64 Picassos, 29 Braques.
Degas, Matisse.
He chose very carefully.
Only the best. The national heritage.
- What do you want us to do, madame?
- Mademoiselle.
Well, I thought, perhaps,
if you could just stop the train.
Stopping the train
is not simple, mademoiselle.
- You can get killed stopping a train.
- Especially if you are French,
and the train is German.
I know. I realise.
But soon Paris will be free, isn't that true?
But if the paintings are not here...
Our latest report is that the Allies
will be in Paris within a week.
Maybe three or four days.
Waldheim is to get
the train out before that.
Can we slow it down? Delay it?
What do you think?
We can blow it up. Maybe.
Put some plastique
under the cars and blow it up.
They'd shoot a few hostages,
but that's the price you pay.
- Are your paintings that important?
- She doesn't want it blown up.
London agrees the art is important.
Anything we can do to save it.
But they leave it up to us.
Why not? What can they lose?
This morning we had
four men left in this group.
Now we are three. One, two, three.
- Bernard?
- We started with 18.
Like your paintings, mademoiselle,
we couldn't replace them.
For certain things, we take the risk.
But I won't waste lives on paintings.
But they wouldn't be wasted.
Ex cuse me.
I know that's a terrible thing to say.
But those paintings are part of France.
The Germans want to take them away.
They've taken our land, our food.
They live in our houses.
And now they're trying to take our art.
This beauty,
this vision of life born out of France.
Our special vision. Our trust.
We hold it in trust. Don't you see?
For everyone. This is our pride.
What we create and hold for the world.
There are worse things
to risk your life for than that.
I'm sorry, mademoiselle.
We can't help you.
The train goes through his section.
It's up to him.
Don't you have copies of 'em?
Ex cuse me for taking your time.
I respect you for what you are doing.
I hope none of you will be harmed.
- She's a nice lady.
- What happened to Bernard?
I had a cup of coffee
with him early this morning.
They came into the yards
and picked him up, with some refugees.
I saw the whole thing.
They just came into the yards
and picked him up.
I thought we came here
to talk about the armament train.
It's a big one, huh, Labiche?
When does it leave?
9.15 tomorrow morning, on the dot.
They must be desperate
to risk a daylight run.
Tell me the schedule.
It'll arrive at the yards at Vaires by 9.45.
Five minutes to switch on the engine
and pick up the antiaircraft crews.
It should be on its way
by ten minutes of ten, no later.
It would be nice
if it were delayed for ten minutes.
British planes will hit the yard at Vaires
tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.
Saturation bombing.
If the train was in the yard at that time...
Ten minutes? It won't be easy.
Can you do it?
- At the moment, I'm not sure how.
- That's up to you.
The planes will bomb
at exactly ten o'clock.
Will the train be there or not?
We'll have it waiting.
I wonder where he'll be at ten o'clock.
Where I'd like to be. In his office.
- I don't like it.
- Who does?
I mean the art train. If the Germans want it
so much, maybe we should do something.
Forget the art train.
We'll have enough to do tomorrow.
Which reminds me, I'll need
another engineer for the art train.
- I'll have to give it to Papa Boule.
- Papa Boule?
- Not Papa Boule!
- I have no choice. Who else is there?
It's an easy run. The train doesn't leave
till dark. It'll be in Germany by morning.
See you later.
Don't just slap the oil on anywhere,
damn it!
Look where the hell you're putting it.
This machine was running
before you were born.
She's like a woman. If you don't treat her
just right, she'll make your life miserable.
Take this. Do it right, for God's sake.
Because I'll be back to check
after I've had my coffee.
Now remember.
A grease job is not a bath.
- Papa.
- Mm-hm.
A cup.
I see Labiche is finally giving you a train.
- And all the way to Germany.
- Some train.
You see any artillery?
A load that a man can feel is important?
That might change the war, huh?
But the important shipment
goes to the front.
Boule.
Have you read what's in those crates?
I don't believe anything they write.
Paintings! Open a case.
You'll find champagne, perfume
and everything else they stole from us.
I've talked to one of the truck drivers.
These are paintings.
- So what?
- Great art. Picasso. Gauguin. Renoir.
Renoir. I used to know
a girl who modelled for Renoir.
She smelled of paint.
Bourges, you are a good engineer,
you have told me so.
But in matters of culture,
you are sadly deficient.
Champagne and perfume
can be replaced. Not art.
- These paintings are important.
- Really?
The glory of France.
Glory of France?
And to think, two days, three at the most,
the Allies should be here.
The Nazis wouldn't have the train.
Maybe even one day...
- Are you the engineer?
- Does he look like an engineer?
You will not leave the station tonight.
Stand by your engine,
ready to leave at a moment's notice.
Ja, mein Korporal.
- Pig!
- Be careful how you talk to them.
I'm too old to be careful.
- The glory of France.
- Huh? Oh, yes.
The glory of France.
Give me the change in franc pieces.
Engineer!
Start the engine!
Heil Hitler.
Loaded and ready, sir.
Very good, Schmidt.
- What time do you leave?
- As soon as it's dark, sir.
Colonel von Waldheim!
Telephone call, sir.
General von Lubitz's headquarters!
The officer says it's urgent.
Colonel von Waldheim speaking.
Yes, Major.
I'm sorry to hear that. Let's hope
the reverses at the front are temporary.
Yes, of course I understand.
The general explained
it might be necessary
to rescind the authorisation for my train.
Unfortunately, I can't help you.
The train left over half an hour ago,
and is now on its way to Germany.
Please express my regrets to the general.
In view of the fact
that you've already left, Schmidt,
I think perhaps you'd better get aboard
and order the train out immediately, huh?
- Yes, sir!
- Have a good trip, Schmidt.
Start the train! Start the train!
Move the train!
Boule! Start the train.
Start the train!
Uncouple that engine! Get it out of here!
- Is the armoured engine ready?
- The antiaircraft crews are all aboard.
Move your engine. Get it out of here!
Hey, you! You pig!
- What?
- Who did that?
The steam is released
or the engine blows up.
- Which do you want?
- You did it on purpose.
What is this?
Take your assigned position.
Back of the cab.
- Everything all right?
- Move your engines...
- It's OK.
- I want this train out of here!
OK.
- What's going on down there, Labiche?
- Sabotage.
Throw five.
Throw eight.
Throw ten.
- Throw ten.
- It's stuck!
Don't force it.
- Stop!
- Hey! Hey!
Hey! Stop!
Stop! You're on the wrong track!
Don't play games with me, Labiche.
I know sabotage when I...
What is it?
But I...
Give me the switch tower.
Dietrich! What the hell
is going on up there?
You idiot!
You get those switches working!
We have got to get this train out of here!
- I'm tired of your inefficiency, Dietrich!
You can't ride through an air raid!
Watch me! Fire up that engine!
You old goat!
Get out of there and get under cover!
- Get off my train!
- You fool! It'll rain bombs any second!
Get off my train!
- You can't go! The switch is closed!
- Open it!
What is it?
What is it?
- What is it?
- The oil line.
Can you fix it?
- Can we run it back to Vaires?
- Maybe, but just the engine.
Where's the phone?
Start the pump.
The repair of my train
is to take top priority, Major.
This whole yard needs repair, Colonel.
I'll see to your engine as soon as I can.
- You'll see to it at once.
- I have my orders. I'll do what I can.
I've given you an order.
I take full responsibility.
- What happened?
- Fault in the oil line.
I'll take care of it. Hand me the spanner.
Take over the crane engine.
Boule!
Boule!
Come here.
Come here!
- Take off the oil caps.
- I'll do it.
He will do it. Go on.
- You can settle the blame for this later.
- One moment, please, sir.
Turn out your pants pockets.
Slick with oil.
Sabotage, Colonel.
It's an old trick around here.
They slip in franc pieces
and cut off the oil supply.
- You should have thrown them away.
- Four francs are four francs.
Major, please. It's not important. I'll have
the engine fixed overnight. I'll do it myself.
Take him away.
Colonel! Stop them.
Wait.
Colonel. He slowed up your train
for a few hours but he saved it.
He took it through the bombs
at the risk of his own life.
He's an old man.
He doesn't know what he's doing.
I'll get your train through for you.
He's just a foolish old man.
His train! His!
It's my train.
I know what I'm doing.
Do you? Huh? You'll help them.
I practically raised you
but you're no better than they are.
Swine!
Colonel! What can you gain
by the death of one old man?
- What he did can make no difference.
- Achtung/ Fire!
You can stop...
You will deliver
that engine to me personally.
I'm holding you responsible.
Simon!
Turn down the forced-draft.
Hurry it up! We're working on
a locomotive, not a pocket watch!
Hubert! Take down the grate.
Didont... what are you doing here?
- Where's Hubert?
- I decided to go along as fireman.
You damn fools.
You lookin' to be shot too?
- Papa Boule wanted it stopped.
- Papa Boule! Papa Boule is dead!
- Stop acting like children.
- Don't be mad, Paul. We want to do this.
Listen, you idiots.
The war'll be over in a few days.
Now leave it alone.
You get caught up in something...
you can't leave it alone.
- You know how it is.
- We'll get away with it, Paul.
All contacts have been made except
at Metz, and you have to call Metz.
Maurice won't go along with us
until he talks to you.
Oh, you know Maurice. He's stubborn.
To hell with you. To hell with both of you.
You wanna be killed, I can't stop you.
We will be killed if you don't call Maurice.
Labiche! Are you taking the night off?
It'll be ready in a couple of hours,
by morning. I'll take it through after dark.
When it's ready get it out of here.
Deliver it.
- In broad daylight?
- Deliver it.
That engine has blocked work
on four trains for the front.
The colonel gave orders for it
to be given top priority. He's got it.
For all I care, it could be shot full
of holes, and his precious train with it.
Move it!
Spitfire.
- No! No, Didont!
- Not us! Not us!
Not us! Not us!
This is the last job. The last one.
When we get to Rive-Reine,
I'll make that call to Maurice.
- What happened?
- Allied aircraft, ten miles back.
Any serious damage?
Any serious damage?!
Not enough to stop you
from getting to Germany.
Camouflage the engine. Schwarz!
- Your engine and your crew.
- Was it your clever idea
to risk this engine in a daylight run?
Major Herren was following
your orders to the letter.
I admire your efficiency, Labiche,
and your sense of survival.
I don't suppose you have much trouble
with saboteurs, do you?
Tell me, Labiche. Do you think there
will be sabotage attempts on this train?
I'm a railroad man, not a prophet.
Prophecy is not required,
only determination.
This train will get through to Germany.
You agree, don't you, Labiche?
What do you want me to do, Colonel?
Give you a guarantee?
I'll settle for a partial guarantee.
You, Labiche.
You'll drive the engine.
The engineer's been assigned.
My orders are to return to Vaires.
Stay with the engine. Keep steam up.
You can go now. You're not needed.
I've worked all night on this engine.
I haven't slept for two days. I'll fall asleep.
You'll leave at seven o'clock.
I think you should rest until then.
Take him to the hotel. He is to stay
there until he returns here at seven.
Sleep well.
My bicycle.
Your transportation to Paris.
Danke.
A room for this man.
Identity card, please.
- 60 francs.
- Pay her.
You pay her.
I'm a guest of the German army.
- He is a railroad man.
- 60 francs.
- Isn't there a discount for railroad men?
- 60 francs.
Top of the stairs, first door on the right.
The sheets are clean.
Labiche!
You heard the colonel - seven o'clock.
Get some rest.
Would like to tuck me in?
Call me at 6.45.
Pesquet.
One German in the office with Jacques.
Give me about two minutes.
Where are you going?
Back in the engine. Use your coal pile.
- What started this?
- We don't know, sir.
You aren't all needed.
Get back to the train.
- Where's Labiche?
- I put him in the hotel, sir.
A few minutes ago.
- Sergeant!
- You two, come!
- Labiche!
Break it down.
Look in the cellar!
- Why are you breaking down my door?
- Labiche, where is he?
Who's your commanding officer?
Captain!
Mademoiselle, come here!
How long has he been here?
Since soup, cabbage and potatoes.
Thank you.
I don't want your thanks. If they'd caught
me helping you, I would have been shot.
I know. I'm sorry.
You think you can run in here
and make trouble?
I run a hotel, not a madhouse. Who's
going to pay for the door and the lock?
Do you think money grows on trees?
- There's a war.
- You talk about the war.
I'll talk about what it costs.
I'll be leaving in a few hours.
You can go back to your good customers.
They pay. That's what I'm in business for.
You should be paid.
- How much for the damage?
- 100 francs.
How much for saving my life?
Who did it?
I'm not sure. I can't remember.
I was struck!
You're lying!
Enough, Pilzer.
If you tell the truth, you'll live.
Now, what does he look like?
Colonel, I can't remember!
A big man.
A grey suit.
A hat, I think.
Sir, Labiche never left the hotel.
Let him go.
Do you want some coffee?
It goes with the room.
No extra charge.
What's your name?
Labiche, the colonel is waiting.
Christine.
Did you get through?
- Jacques, is the track all clear up ahead?
- All the way to Germany.
(Colonel) Sleep well, Labiche?
Like a baby, Colonel.
I trust this time
the bearings are well-oiled?
Why don't you check them yourself?
Sergeant!
Sergeant Schwarz will ride with you.
The last town before
entering Germany will be St Avold.
You will stop there for Captain Schmidt
to telephone a report to me.
A pleasant trip, Captain.
Is that clear?
I will stop at St Avold.
Have you ever been to Germany,
Labiche?
No, Colonel.
You should find
the experience interesting.
A chance to broaden your horizon.
All right, stationmaster.
Just keep out of my way.
Stop at St Avold,
we'll get our heads blown off.
Get me Commercy, please.
I don't have a direct line.
This is railroad business!
- What's the matter?
- Your army regulations.
Montmirail.
Chalons.
Hello, Metz? It's on time.
Hello, Metz? Rive-Reine.
Is that you, Maurice?
Where is he?
When will he be back?
Have him call Jacques at Rive-Reine
as soon as possible.
Yes, it's important.
Thank you.
- What time will you be home, Uncle?
- When I get home, I'll be home!
I'm sitting enjoying myself! Drinking,
playing cards, having a good time.
You can see that, can't you?
Aunt Hélène wanted to know.
Robert.
