Can I have a shot glass, please?
Photo sent.
Stay on this heading for about 6h30min.
Turn left at the
Aurora Borealis.
When you see something that looks like
a frozen gall bladder, that's Greenland.
Hang a soft right there.
- All set there, Mr. Hauser?
- Yeah, thank you.
Guidestar!
Guidestar!
Welcome back.
Hotel? Dinner reservations?
Movie tickets, maybe?
Mr. Hauser
Is there something else you need?
I don't know.
I feel...
Go on.
Like a refuge from the
Island of Dr. Moreau.
Some morally inverted, twisted
character from a Céline novel.
The hot sauce helps.
You still getting those
nightmares you told me about?
They're coming back faster and faster. I
don't know if I can keep outrunning 'em.
That'll be it, Jerry.
I gotta go.
You bet, Mr. Hauser. GuideStar
wants you to feel secure.
GuideStar.
Be still my trembling hands,
for how you would tremble...
if you knew where I
would take you next.
Incoming message.
Incoming message.
You got him on the comm there?
Bring it over.
Hello, Hauser!
Hello, Mr. Vice President.
I haven't been vice president
for five months.
Otherwise, this all might
be a conflict of interest.
Tamerlane and the U.S. government,
and I in particular, were cleared...
of any and all violations of federal,
state and international laws...
by the bipartisan committee.
Just read the report.
I'm sure anything you weren't supposed
to be doing you were cleared of.
And of course I was preemptively
pardoned by the president.
I got the snapshots.
Love your work.
- We're all big fans.
- Yes.
Let's see if the
damn Krauts...
will cross us in the
Security Council now.
We seem to be heading southeast.
Where am I going?
Hope you like the smell
of fresh liberation.
Give me a sec.
I gotta growler down there
the size of a cane frog.
Turaqistan.
What's the gig?
Omar Sharif.
- Omar Sharif?
- Yeah.
The CEO of Ugi Gas, the
Ugikistani conglomerate.
He is building a pipeline
through his country.
We didn't liberate Turaqistan
to get hustled by a fez head.
Terminate.
Do do that voodoo
that you do so well.
You'll be working directly under the
viceroy just appointed by the president.
His identity is still being withheld
on a need to know basis.
- And no one needs to know.
- He asked for you personally.
- What's my cover?
- Trade show producer.
Trade show? What show?
What show?
It's gonna be huge.
Tamerlane is sponsoring
a trade expo, Brand USA.
It's our big launch bringing democracy
to this part of the world.
We've bombed the shit out of them,
there's a lot of rebuilding to do.
- Shows a nice spirit.
- Somebody has to help them.
This is a great opportunity
for Tamerlane and the U.S.
Not to mention the
people of Turaqistan.
And to top it all off, there's gonna
be a gala wedding. Isn't that great?
Seems like a pretty elaborate cover. I'm
gonna be responsible for all that shit?
This is a historic moment.
The first war ever to be 100%
outsourced to private enterprise.
Tamerlane jets, Tamerlane
tanks, Tamerlane soldiers.
And to top it all off,
the Brand USA expo.
It's your show, baby.
Welcome to the Turaqi
Green Zone, sir.
Tamerlane welcomes Expo
Turaqistan, Brand USA.
Welcome to Turaqistan, sir.
I'm Marsha Dillon...
hoping you're
ready to kill.
I've been briefed.
SPF-Eighty-seven, sir.
- Shall we?
- Yes.
It all looks good.
Great lights.
Take out the Tamercard.
What's your cover, by the way?
Undergrad Wharton with a masters in
communication at the Annenberg School.
- Very impressive.
- Well, it's fake.
- Tell me that's not the stage?
- I think it is.
East, honey, east.
Do you want people turning away from
the stage to pray five times a day?
Cultural sensitivity.
That's what we're about here.
Sorry, sir.
What exactly is wrong
with my credentials?
I've been cleared. My
colleagues are going in.
- Am I being singled out for some reason?
- I can't allow that.
Very curious.
- Find out who she is.
- Very curious situation.
- Let's go, ma'am.
- Oh. Okay.
And set up a meeting
with her in my office.
Do I have an office?
Great. Carry on.
Yes, and I'll just try to
rearrange the entire place.
- Just see if you can spin it.
- Yes.
Ms. Hegalhuzen.
Your 2:30's here.
I read your piece in
"Atlantic Monthly".
Very provocative.
- Nice office.
- It's bulletproof.
Send her in.
Passion. This
is beautiful.
Thank you!
Hey, okay, okay,
we'll be in touch.
- It's a gift. I brought a gift to you.
- Thank you.
- It's a form of dance.
- Thank you. Good stuff.
Pay-for-view TV.
Next week!
And you are an angel.
Thanks for the bag!
Ms."Hugelhazen".
Hegalhuzen.
- Hegalhuzen. Brand Hauser.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Come on in.
Now...
Holy shit!
So, you're here to cover
our little trade show...
"...that's being billed as
a liberating Turaqistan...
satisfy the American consumer's
dreams just the opposite now.
The proposed Expo Turaqistan offers
nothing more than the auctioning of...
Turaqistan's future to the cause of
profit and international branding.
Yeah, I remember that because I wrote it.
There's no corruption here. Just
read the Silverman James Report.
I have. It's bullshit.
Look. We've already kicked out of this
place. What are we supposed to do?
Turn our backs on all of the
entrepreneurial possibilities?
Business is human response
to a moral or cosmic crisis.
Whether it's a tsunami or a
sustained aerial bombardment...
there's the same urgent
call for urban renewal.
When did they start attacking
inside the Emerald City?
I wouldn't call that an attack.
Well, technically, that was a bombing.
At least it sounded like it was.
Not an attack, which would
imply something else.
Do you really think
I'm as bad as all this?
- I don't know anything about you.
- Would you like to?
It's my job.
You make it sound so
tedious. Could be fun.
- Then why don't I begin?
- Thought you'd never ask.
Would you excuse me for one minute?
- Call me soon.
- When?
You'll feel it.
- All righty then. Where were we?
- I haven't said anything yet.
Excellent, 'cause I don't
remember hearing anything.
- Then we're off to a great start.
- What can I do for you?
Why do I have access?
Even on such a low level.
Ouch.
All my writings have called this
a violation of international law...
and its practitioners are criminals.
Do you really believe
all the stuff you write?
Anyone who could cause this much
mayhem when he didn't have to?
The amount of
suffering that I've seen?
Hang on.
Okay. Hold on a sec.
But the way I look at it is this.
The day we can actually feel and
hear all the suffering of mankind...
that's the day when the
Christ will come back.
So we got that going for us.
I'll be out in a minute.
Or the Buddha, or Allah,
whoever floats your boat.
Ms. Hagenhazel.
- Call me Natalie.
- Natalie.
I really must run. I feel like we're
on the verge of something important.
Do you think we could continue
this conversation over drinks?
- Drinks?
- Yeah, I know a friendly place.
Marsha, will you set that up?
9, 10-ish?
Unattended cars will be
crushed and incinerated.
Hello, sir. Welcome to Popeye's.
How can I help you?
I'll have crawfish étouffée, the Big
Flava chicken sandwich with Boss Sauce...
and to top off my meal,
a frothy orange drink.
- I'm here to see the viceroy.
- Sir.
Don't mention his name.
Follow me!
Okay!
Let's go, boys.
One, two, one, two march!
- He's not here?
- Closed circuit, sir.
Welcome to liberated
Turaqistan, Hauser.
Big fan. Have been for ages.
Sorry for the secret
identity bullshit...
but it's a brave new security.
I'll be contacting you by phone,
but if you wish to contact me...
you'll have to come here
to the bunker, 'kay?
Omar Sharif.
He's staying at the Freedom
Grand through the closing ceremony.
Make sure he doesn't
make his plane.
Got it.
Now, about this
closing ceremony...
It looks like we Yonica Babyyeah
wedding. Incredible, huh?
What is a Yonica Babyyeah?
The Britney Spears
of Central Asia.
Kids from Baca to Yemen
are nuts for her.
Anyway. The point is...
this weddin' is the grand
finale of the trade show.
This is the biggest extravaganza
in the history of Central Asia.
And it's the centerpiece
of our P.R. blitz here.
It's perfect branding synergy, Hauser.
Blends the image of an American-style
woman getting her own and getting it on.
A great new
democratic dynasty...
with all the strength and
virility of traditional warlords.
Exactly.
That's why you're the best.
Overall, we see it as a
pretty irresistible package.
We're getting worldwide coverage, U.S.
networks, Sky Channel, Al Jazeera...
so make it big buddy.
See she gets everything she wants
and make this a grand finale...
the world will never forget.
You bet.
Jeff? So, listen. I met this guy...
No, he's just some mid-level schmo.
Anyway, I think if I play him right, I
can get a pass out of the Green Zone...
and I can see what's
really going on here.
No chip for me, thanks.
Ma'am, you really won't get the
full experience without the chip.
Doctor's orders.
I get hives.
Welcome to Implanted
Journalist Experience.
Thanks to cutting-edge Tamerlane
Interactive Technology...
we are now able to reduce the risk of
journalist mortality to virtually zero.
The Combat-o-Rama
Implantation Device...
will allow you to experience
full spectrum sensory reality.
Over the next seventy-two hours,
some of you may experience...
headaches, nausea and some
muscle pain. This is normal.
If symptoms of epilepsy occur,
please notify your doctor.
Thanks and enjoy the ride.
Mr. Hauser!
Mr. Hauser!
Yonica Baby is two minutes
from arrival. We need to go.
Yonica!
I love you!
Jesus Christ.
Hi. Welcome. How
was traffic?
I hear those checkpoints
can be murder.
Where is dressing room?
I'm fucking wasted.
Well, let me show you.
She needs Popeye ten-piece box.
All white meat.
Extra crispy, extra spicy.
Diet Coke. You get it?
And pickles.
She wants pickles.
Clausen classic dill pickles.
- Pickles?
- Yeah.
- All right...
- You are big boss?
- I guess I am, yeah.
- How big?
Don't do that.
Confiscate that film.
I do what I want.
Okay?
Of course you do and we're
excited to have you.
Don't get too excited.
I'm not that excited. Let me
show you to your dressing room.
Get some chicken, pickles.
and whatever you want.
Come on in. Hi.
Nice work with the bat.
How are you? Hi, good luck.
Hi. Mr. Pickle. Las Vegas.
Mr. Federline.
The impending marriage of
Central Asian pop star...
and Ooq- Mi-Fay Taqnufmini the
scion of the powerful Turaqi clan.
The marriage.
A symbol of democratization...
or a sleazy public
relations stunt?
Yes or no?
Natalie.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Jesus.
What is this place?
It's the Freedom Grand.
How do you like it?
Guess I could go with
strange love in the desert.
Weird. Rarefied.
Coven-like.
- Stop me if I'm rambling.
- Stop. Sit.
Can I get a double bourbon?
Vodka twist? How's that?
- Okay.
- Thank you.
So, you're producing the big...
Freedom's on the March economic
land-grab masquerade.
Are you with Tamerlane employee
or a freelance producer?
That's complicated.
Let's get to that later.
I just wanted to get to know you.
Okay, tell me about yourself.
Just doing this gig, trying to
make the best of a bad situation.
Looking for redemption in all the wrong
places. Stop me now if I'm rambling.
- Okay, stop.
- How about you?
How about me what?
You know, tell me about you.
Where're you from?
Who gives a fuck? Are you serious?
I'm serious as a deacon. I'd like
to get to know you as a person.
For God's sakes... why?
Well, what the hell else are we gonna
do on this dark and lonely night?
So you wanna seduce the journalist
whose politics you despise?
How dare you?
I have no politics.
Everyone does, even if
they don't know it.
- Not me.
- Just a straight mercenary?
I'm a host. I'm a showman.
I'm an organizer.
There's just people here. Some good,
some bad. All interesting.
You seem like an interesting person and
I try not to over-think these things.
You're a clever guy.
Some would even call you charming.
But it gets tired, doesn't it? All that
patter, the show biz, it's just a mask.
There's gotta be a person
in there somewhere.
Did you know that "person" comes from
the Latin word persona which means mask?
Being human means we
invite spectators...
to ponder what lies behind.
Each of us would be composed
of a variety of masks.
And if we can see behind the mask,
we would get a burst of clarity.
If that flame was bright
enough, then we fall in love.
What's your opinion on
these divine matters?
I'm not gonna fuck you.
You know that, right?
Oh, I hope that you
know that somewhere.
I sense you're such an angry woman.
You're just intent to laying
waste to all of us, aren't you?
That was the best half-true
frontier gibberish I've heard.
Thanks.
- Hey. Listen.
- Yes?
All access pass to the trade show,
compliments of the house.
- Don't be a stranger.
- I won't be.
Now, let's get these passé's right.
Ayat, a little knee jerk.
Make it work. Make it work.
Very good.
All in the legs, girls.
How many times do we have
to say this? Ayat!
Higher!
Big smile, Reshbeck!
For God's sake.
Thank you.
You're back for some more gibberish.
You remember Marsha?
This is Peter Parker.
Choreographer, worked with Rob
Marshall, all the big musicals.
It's incredible. Each girl
is a trans-femoral amputee...
who had lost her leg
during the liberation.
And thanks to Tamerlane, we can
have you up and dancing in no time.
Just another example of
how American know-how...
alleviates the suffering it creates.
Look at this. Hamy Shenkman had her leg
blown off by an M-18 Claymore landmine.
And, Conyel Bisland...
an M-72 rocket-propelled grenade...
that mistakenly hit her high school.
And Tamerlane used the exact same RPG
firing pin rod assembly technology...
that it uses in the prosthetic
knees of its.
Talk about vertical integration.
It's hot in here.
Let me get that for ya.
Krishmish, come over here.
This is Ms. Hegalhuzen, she's
writing a story about the show.
All right. Okay.
Ms. Babyyeah's ready
for her run-through.
We've gotta go. My trade
show's your trade show.
Come on, girls. Gather here.
You say you want to
invade me, baby
You say you want to
enslave me, baby
I want to blow you up
You say you want
to free me, baby
BGut you cannot
even see me, baby
I want to blow you up
I want to blow you sky
high, high, go fly
I want to blow
You
You want to occupy
my heart and soul
A black widow in
a spider hole
I want to blow you up
I want to blow you up
I want to blow you
down if it's okay
Mr. Hauser, how do you feel about
the image of Turaqi women...
My coat!
Cut!
So there's this reporter
who really despises me.
I mean, she doesn't really despise me,
she despises what I represent.
I think if she knew the real me,
she'd hate me even more.
I mean, don't you think?
I wasn't there.
Does it really matter?
Actually, I think I just like
the sound of her voice.
I could listen to her
revile me for hours.
Do you think with her, the reporter
I mean, it's just about sex?
- What do you mean just?
- I don't know.
There's this Turaqi pop star. She
disturbs me and I can't figure out why.
Could you be attracted to her sexually?
No, are you crazy?
She's just a little...
I'm not calling you in the
middle of the night, Mr. Hauser.
- I gotta go.
- Whatever.
You're a fuckin' asshole.
GuideStar!
This has to end for me, sir. I
want a different kind of life.
I want to get married, start a family.
Operation Chickenhawk
never ends.
The ceaseless epic struggle
to dominate...
the destiny of man obliges his noble
cares to continually purge the world...
of those who are evil-doers.
But that's not just working
for me right now, sir.
A woman?
You and I, Hauser, are
a part of a rug hook.
All these years I felt a special
bond. Don't you feel that?
No.
Well, you think about it.
If you still feel this
way in a couple of days...
I already told you, sir.
- That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.
Marsha, this is kind of a bad time.
Hey! I wanted to give you the heads up.
A delivery should be there any second.
When, now?
Oh, shit.
Sir, I have your
dry cleaning, sir!
Thank you. Thank you.
I need the ticket, sir.
- I have that somewhere.
- Yeah, I need that claim ticket, sir.
I think I put it... should
be around here somewhere.
- You're talking about the claim ticket?
- It's around here somewhere.
- Sir, can you hurry?
- Yep.
Sir, I gotta have that ticket or...
No, no...
Oh, here it is.
- Sir, you have a nice day.
- Sure.
Yo, yo, yo, mother fuckers!
It's me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Straight from the dry
in Rammstein, Germany
You can't believe these guys. 20
years ahead of the rest of the world.
And this cost the U.S. taxpayers, what?
Three, four grand?
Be nice.
I'm really sorry about the jacket.
Okay.
Listen, would you like to get
a Turaqi coffee?
I hear they make it great here.
Cardamom mace. The good kind.
I was just about to wash my hair.
It's a delicacy. Sweetened
with pomegranate honey.
One cup?
Give me a minute.
What?
There's just something irresistible
about a Western woman speaking Turaqi.
Is that a recognized
international phenomena?
No. It's a personal sensibility.
Look. I admit I don't actually
believe any of this stuff we say.
I mean, not in the sense that I
believe it to be actually true.
You talk too much. I want
to ask you something.
Doesn't it hurt you to put yourself
in such a contorted moral position?
Can you tell me, for example,
one completely honest thing?
One.
This is Donny Loo's
favorite juice.
It is rated at just under a quarter
million Scoville units.
When I find the demands of
life to be challenging...
I take a wee drop.
The more challenging...
the higher the Scoville units.
- Let me.
- Be careful.
But the trick, you see...
that I've taught myself, is to
never allow my eyes to tear up.
One completely honest thing.
If you really knew me, you'd despise
me even more than you do.
No. I don't despise you.
I don't really care enough.
Marsha.
It's fucking great.
Michael Bay can blow me.
He can and he should.
- We do all of Yonica's videos.
- We're blowing up.
A bad choice
of words.
Listen, guys, this has been great.
Thank you.
I have another meeting. I have to run.
But I, I really enjoyed it.
Let us have some footage of the
wedding. We'll hook you up, dude.
Hey, we know everything that
goes on in Turaqistan.
No place we cannot go, no one we
don't know, nothing we cannot do.
Okay.
Does one of you have a card?
Whoever the leader is.
Here we go. The Jackpot.
Here, thank you. Thank you.
There you go. You have his,
and he has yours.
- Yes.
- He's got yours.
- It's gonna be great.
- Bye-bye, guys.
Where's my package?
The shipment left the warehouse
in Dubai 2 days ago.
We're tracking it.
Just get me a fuckin' cobra,
all right?
- A snake?
- Yeah. Chop-chop.
Come on, spit it out.
Is only me, Mr. Big
Yonica. Hi.
Listen. Sorry about my reaction to
your song. I didn't mean to offend you.
No. I am sorry. I am so stupid to
not understand that you are woman.
Uh, sorry?
In Turaqi we have no word for
this. Same as for a woman.
No, no, no.
That's not it.
I predict most people.
Why not you?
How my ass make
you puke?
Bad babakanoosh or something.
I think you're lovely.
Stunning, actually.
- Lovely?
- Yes.
You think attractive?
Yep. Definitely.
- Does her ass make you puke?
- Who? Who? Who?
That skinny bitch reporter
with the tape recorder.
No.
You're a tit man.
Do you want massage?
Be a happy ending.
Does your father know that you
talk this way?
- My father?
- Yeah.
I do not speak to him anymore.
But he sends me money for dancing
lessons and singing lessons.
I am with Ooq-Mi-Fay now.
And he wants for me
to be big success.
Yonica rules.
That is what he says to me.
- What about your mother?
- Dead.
I'm sorry.
For why? You did not kill her.
I don't think so.
Too much sorry. Too much.
Jesus Christ!
What is wrong with you?
You are a fucking asshole,
do you know that?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"I'm sorry".
You're always sorry.
Fuck you, Mr. Sorry.
Fuck you.
Yonica, don't go away mad.
Marsha?
Get me a dinner reservation
tonight. Somewhere with soup.
So everything's OK? You're closing
some big deals at the trade show?
Is there an actual
reason for this meeting?
I am not big on bullshit.
I'm your host. I want you to be
happy nd that everything is...
well and you're
taken care of.
A beautiful woman.
There is something we can
agree on after all, then.
Can you get me an introduction?
- She's a journalist.
- Who cares?
Sit.
Don't eat all your soup.
Thank you.
So between your father's indictments,
were you still on the lacrosse team?
No. I actually blew out my fuckin' knee.
Hey, you.
Hey, we are doing
an interview here.
Omar Sharif wants to meet you.
- The actor?
- Better. The president of Ugi Gas.
Sorry. Just one minute.
I'm gonna pick this up in one.
who do I have to shoot to get
a fuckin' drink around here?
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?
Get back to normal!
Natalie Hegalhuzen,
Omar Sharif.
Exquisitely enraptured, ma chère.
- Pleased to meet you, too.
- Shall we dance?
How're you doin'?
How come we Americans
a hard time?
An interesting conundrum, isn't it?
Very shrewd of you to ask.
What would I get
for telling you?
The thrill of knowing you're
my confidential source.
The thought of this
leaves me breathless.
My dear, let me explain
something to you.
The Americans
had no plan.
Perhaps next year they
will invade my country.
And then, they will either
kill me or throw me in jail.
Or kill me in jail.
Or maybe make me president.
Or maybe make me president,
then kill me.
That still doesn't
answer you question.
Why hasn't the U.S. stopped
the Ugi Gas pipeline?
See what you can find out about
Operation Chickenhawk.
Chickenhawk?
Yeah, baby!
Get it out.
A message from the viceroy.
Freedom is messy.
Employees must wash hands
before returning to work.
What stinks here?
Yeah. You look like piece of shit.
You smell like piece of shit.
You want some shit?
Where're you going?
Night's young.
This place is crazy.
Would you like to come back to
my suite for a quiet drink?
Oh, no thank you, Omar. But I will
look into that thing about you told.
Enjoyed it.
- I think I'll go back to my hotel.
- Can I drive you?
Oh, no, that's okay.
Let me give you a lift.
I can help you. It's safer that way.
Please.
I'll feel better.
When did all that construction start?
Oh. They're diverting the river Tures
so it runs by the trade show.
They wanted a clear view from
the Tiki Room. It's cute, huh?
What do you think
of that girl, Yonica?
You don't wanna know.
- Come on. Try me.
- Okay.
I think that she's a sad little
girl who's been pimped out...
into a pathetic monstrosity of
alienated Western sexuality.
How do you feel about that, Mr. Hauser?
She's a disaster.
This whole place is a disaster.
So, you're sleeping with her.
No.
Why not?
She seems game.
It must be nice to be who you say you
are. To do things you believe in.
That's so simple. So clean.
It's like, you know: "why didn't
I think of that"?
Well, it's hard not to feel like...
I'm always on
the losing side.
Well, you are.
Yeah. It gets kinda Ionely.
That's why you got all those peasants
and workers to keep you company.
I don't have that big a bed.
Tell me more.
I think that you should
take me home now.
Yes, well...
thanks for
taking me home.
Oh. Good night then.
Jesus, what was that?
I can't do that...
No. You yourself said,
I just don't want to.
- Yeah. Sure.
- And good night.
Tomorrow can I see ya?
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.
Reporter's Pool, ten a.m.
Progress update, people.
Banks West didn't even wait
for the opening ceremony...
closing a one point 3
billion dollar deal...
with Roof Branch and Blossom to
restore essential water services...
to the people of Turaqistan!
Oh, come on!
I'm sure they'd like to give a shout-out
to the Tamerlane- Furg-Bomber...
Wing for, for those
humane position strikes...
that created this wonderful
opportunity for everyone.
So is this like a date?
This is like obscene.
There's something you can do
for me that would mean a lot.
Name it.
Get me a pass out of the Emerald City
so I can see what's really going on.
- Very dangerous.
- I wanna see Fallof.
Natalie, there's nothing there.
I wanna know if it's true that
Tamerlane used chemical weapons.
Isn't it a little late to be worrying
about international conventions?
Is nerve gas worse than getting your
head blown off by a laser missile?
Frankly, it's a nuance
that's lost on me.
Besides they were cleared,
just read the report.
We're trying to watch
a battle here.
Sorry.
Come on, come on, come on.
Give me something. Give me something.
Anything's gotta be better
than this Xbox bullshit!
Okay, okay.
These guys are big in the
Turaqi arts community.
You know, the whole downtown scene?
Might give you a good lead.
I'm hit!
I'm hit!
Where's the damn Medevac?
The Tamerlane custom
E- Z missile mount can...
be adapted to fit over 200
automobile models...
I thought we were all
set with the Ayatollah.
Pick it up, boys.
What do you mean he won't
do a mixed wedding? Who's mixed?
Yonica's Episcopalian?
How the fuck did that happen?
Will the Sufi work?
Let me call you back.
I got another call.
Just get a number for Cat Stevens.
Hello. Can you calm down?
Yeah, he's right here.
Yoni...
That was the girl.
She said she can't do the
wedding if you're involved.
She thinks you don't like her.
- What?
- She can't work with you.
I'm on it, I'm on it.
Okay.
And then Anderson Cooper,
Mr. Salt and Pepper Integrity...
is arriving today and, and all
we have left is a junior suite.
Is that okay? I mean, he is
a Vanderbilt and everything.
There could be repercussions!
GuideStar!
You seem a little bit, Mr. Hauser.
Is everything all right?
My hand was shaking.
My hand never shakes.
Worst case, Parkinson's. I can get
you a doctor's appointment in Dubai.
I can't focus.
This girl. This reporter.
They're in my head.
They're in my fucking brain.
That's not good, Mr. Hauser.
Not good.
No, I know it isn't. And now I
gotta see her, the little one.
I gotta bring her food.'Cause
she won't go to the thing.
Fuck!
Trusting you was a little rude
I wish there was a way
You could sooth that ache in me
Phone cut out
When we were talking today
Phone cut out
When we were talking today
That was beautiful.
- You recorded that yet?
- Fat fucking chance.
Well you should.
I feel like it's like I'm
seeing you for the first time.
Well, you've seen my ass.
And you not liking it.
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?
Talk as if you have no soul.
Nobody cares for my beautiful soul.
They care for my ass.
- You sound like a tramp.
- Bitches rule.
Yonica rules.
Virgins are good for
getting fucked. Right?
That is what I am good for. Right?
That's what everybody knows.
You know what I think?
I think the girl that wrote
that song was a poet.
I thought that song was really great.
I am not from this world.
I have special powers.
I can see inside
people's brains.
What do you see?
You think you care about me.
Neither one of us know why.
You're not an
alien life form.
You're just very confused.
And you live in a terrible world.
I cannot be from this place.
I do not belong here.
We have to find a way.
We just have to find a way.
Who are you?
We got stuff here.
We got a side of
Clausen Classic Dill,
and Turaqi brand soda.
Extra crispy, all white meat.
You want a piece?
It's actually a horrible way
to soothe bad feelings...
but can lead to compulsive eating...
But, you know, sometimes you
just gotta do it, right?
What the fuck?
You know what?
I'm gonna blow you up.
you mother fuckin' nice...
suit necktie piece of shit!
Take a rain check on that.
Out of the Emerald City?
In fact, baby, the money is right,
I can take you to Chechnya.
I could scrape together
a thousand dollars.
Honey, for a thousand dollar
we take you to Starbucks.
So, we open on her,
she's like Snow White.
Then he arrives. A two-shot, like in,
Ford's My Darling Clementine.
When Victor Mature
returns to her.
Fuck film, assholes.
I want her on all fours.
Waiting for her phallic
warlord, Ooq-Mi-Fay.
I know it's none of my business,
what are you guys talking about?
We're shooting the
wedding night's video.
Yeah, check it out.
We already made the card.
My God.
- How much you guys want for this?
- 500 bucks.
I'll give you 50
right now, cash.
Done.
Washington's all a-twitter by
allegations from a journalist...
that the son of a top
Turaqi political leader...
and his pop star
bride are involved...
in a pornographic video of
their own wedding night.
Expo Turaqistan. Out of the
frying pan into the fire?
How in the fuck did this Hegalhuzen
bitch get a hold of this story?
