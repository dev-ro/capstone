Whoa!
Sorry, dude.
We didn't mean to sneak up on you.
It's just that we can't get to
where we want to go.
Oh, where do you want to go?
We're Iooking for Pike's TraiI.
- Pike's TraiI?
- Yeah.
This map we got at the dock is no good.
Yeah. WeII, north is up.
That might heIp.
And you might wanna think about
staying cIose to the shoreIine here.
There's no ceII reception
in case you get Iost.
Just head up the traiI about three cIicks,
you'II see a big oak tree, hook Ieft.
About another haIf cIick and...
it shouId be right in front of you.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
AIso, hey, a coupIe house ruIes here
on Kings IsIand.
You gotta go by dark,
don't Ieave any trash and... no drinking.
Okay.
So... unIoad the beer.
Come on, dude.
- Have a nice day.
- Bye.
By the way,
don't Iet anyone see that fIask.
How's your day going? Okay?
You know, this is the river
that Ieads down to the Iake.
We had to put this...
that we have of the isIand.
It's the biggest one,
but there's aIso a Iist of things on here.
Oh, there's no ceII service up here.
I'm afraid you'II just have to Iook
at the Iake.
Hey, Mister Sanderson.
Are you home?
I actuaIIy know that you're around...
'cause I saw the smoke
coming outta the chimney.
Are you cooking something?
Are you cooking Iike a stew?
It smeIIs reaIIy good.
It smeIIs Iike good stew.
You wanna invite me in for some?
- Hey.
- Go away. I'm fine.
I know, I know.
I'm just doing my job.
You're the onIy other guy
who Iives on this isIand.
What wouId peopIe think of me
if I didn't check in on my neighbor?
ExactIy what part of ''I'm fine''
don't you understand?
I...
Thanks for checking in on me, Henry.
Hey, no probIem, Mister Sanderson.
Wanna come in for dinner?
Oh, wouIdn't wanna impose.
The radius is too big.
Shit, we shouId've hit these guys
before take-off.
LittIe thing caIIed probabIe cause.
We didn't have it,
fucking Constitution.
We couId aIso use some more men.
Yeah, we couId use a Iot of things.
We got four thousand miIes
of border here.
OnIy probIem is we're Iooking
at Canada.
Canadians don't wanna
sneak in here.
That's why we don't get squat.
AII anyone cares about
is Mexicans sneaking in,
and we just happen to be facing
the wrong fucking way.
Hang up. Now.
Where are we
with the GPS moduIator?
- Uh, nothing pinpointed yet.
- What about border patroI?
PIane was fIying too Iow
for them to track it.
There's onIy one reason a pIane
fIies without a transponder...
and Iow enough to avoid radar,
and that's because they're carrying
a Ioad of some very naughty shit.
We're gonna have to troII
the waterways, boys and girIs,
and that couId take aII night.
Open it.
Pardon our intrusion.
We are with the RCMP,
patroIIing the area.
We heard you needed heIp...
in Iocating a suspected drug
deIivery that went down
coupIe of hours ago aIong the border.
We have knowIedge of the isIand...
and wouId Iike to offer
you our assistance.
You're a bit out of your jurisdiction,
aren't you?
And, uh, we don't use horses.
See, we drive cars.
What Mister Johnson meant to say
is thanks, but no thanks.
ShitIoad of red-tape to team up
with the Mounties.
Much obIiged.
We'II keep you posted.
Pardon me,
but we can be reaIIy heIpfuI.
We have HMI Iights,
we have generator, we have troIIing gear.
If we don't find the drugs
before the runners,
it wiII be picked up, shipped out,
and chopped down by morning.
Time is of, uh, the essence.
I appreciate your concern,
but not interested.
There's no Ieads
that we can share at this time.
WeII, giddy up.
Hey, what the fuck, Frenchie?
I toId your boys we didn't need any heIp.
Is this some sort of joke?
Do I Iook funny to you?
Uh, yeah, as a matter of fact,
you do.
Is it my shoes?
Uh, kinda.
You see, I don't wear Ieather.
I'm a vegan. It's for the environment.
I'm heIping the pIanet.
Do you know that cow farts...
...are responsibIe for one quarter
of the methane poIIution in the worId?
Freeze!
Drop the gun.
- Shoot him!
- I can't get a shot!
- We can do this one of two ways.
- Hey! I'm the guy with the gun!
And I'm the guy with the guy.
You can turn over the GPS
Iocation of the crash,
and I spare you a painfuI death.
Or we can keep on pIaying games.
I have it.
Good. How cIose?
MiddIe of the Iake,
few kiIometers from shore.
No read on depth, but easiIy
reachabIe by boat.
- You're sure?
- Yes.
Let's hope it's wrapped tight.
It was not supposed to be under water.
Let's move.
We'II find out about the ranger.
We won't have any unknowns.
Get the horses en route to the dock.
Four hours
before repIacements show up.
Better get the Humvee,
it wiII be faster.
Think about our carbon footprint.
Think about the chiIdren.
HeIIo? Is anybody here?
HeIIo?
Down here. Oh!
Thank goodness.
I have been here hours.
I got tired of yeIIing for heIp.
CouId you come down here, pIease?
I'm, I'm kind of stuck.
Yeah, hoId on. I'II be right there.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
So you got yourseIf Iodged in
here pretty good?
Yeah. It's, uh, it's kinda stupid.
I, um, I saw a bIackberry.
Can you beIieve that?
Twisted my ankIe reaching
for it and I sIipped.
I'm, uh, I'm pinned in here.
AII right. It doesn't seem so bad.
HoId on, wait. Let's just, uh...
How's that? How's the Ieg?
It's, uh, sore.
- Is it?
- Yeah.
Let's get you up on the path, okay?
- Yeah.
- Um, I'II stay here.
Turn around and I'II push.
AII right? So you,
you just, uh,
I'II stay back here and push you.
- Just, actuaIIy, Iet me get up next to you.
- Okay.
- AII right. Ready?
- Yeah.
- Okay. Just hoId on to me.
- Okay.
- Can you put any weight on it?
- Some.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Here. I'm just gonna carry you, okay?
I'm gonna Iose my feminist card for this.
WeII, I won't teII anyone if you don't.
Hey, guys, you know
the ceII tower is down and...
HoIy shit!
No ceII, radio's busted.
There's a GPS signaI coming
from the water near Kings IsIand.
That's where they're headed.
They're going to the dock!
It doesn't Iook too bad.
We'II just keep it eIevated.
I couId tie it a IittIe tighter.
That wouId keep the sweIIing down.
- Okay.
- Okay. You ready?
I'II puII on three.
One, two, three.
You tricked me.
So, are you a miIitary guy?
Yeah. How'd you know?
You got the Iook.
AIso, you know,
the photographs over there.
Uh, yeah, I was a diver.
Uh, they used to caII us frogmen.
Wow, that sounds exciting.
Uh, weII, I mean, I guess it depends
on the IeveI of danger.
Right. I mean,
I didn't mean it sounded fun.
Just, you know,
it's not your normaI nine-tofive.
So, you never get IoneIy being out here,
aII by yourseIf?
CoupIe hundred peopIe
come through here every weekend.
Yeah, but there's being around peopIe,
and then there's being with peopIe.
CouId I be sounding more of a bitch?
I'm sorry.
No, no, no. I understand.
It must Iook pretty weird.
I just, uh,
I just needed to be by myseIf, so...
Had to cIear my head of some stuff.
Right, so how Iong you been here?
- Three years.
- Three years?
WeII, it must be pretty cIear by now.
CIear. It's getting better.
StiII a bit murky.
WeII, cIear or murky,
it's a, it's a nice head.
Aw, thanks, ma'am.
Hey, um, how's the ankIe feeIing?
Better.
Good, 'cause it's gonna get dark soon.
We don't wanna Iose the Iight
on the water.
ProbabIy couId get you down
to your canoe.
- Okay.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
- Hey, you... know,
...it wouId be no probIem to quickIy
shuttIe you across the water.
That's kind, but I'II be fine.
Besides, I don't want to Ieave
my canoe here.
Okay.
We shouId exchange info, though.
So you know I made it back safeIy.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's great.
Okay.
I, uh, I stoIe a map from your office.
I hope you don't mind.
Those things are worth Iike,
thousands, you know.
WeII, use this hundred doIIars worth
to write down your number.
And I can caII you before dinner.
Dinner?
Yeah. Dinner.
You know,
eating a meaI at night together.
Speaking in between bites
to get to know someone.
Uh-huh. Um, next week sometime?
I was thinking more Iike tonight.
My address is on the back.
I'II expect you around nine?
We couId eat a picnic under the stars?
You saved me today.
Let me say thank you. PIease.
I don't know.
I've got a Iot of stuff to do up
at the Iodge.
Yeah, I noticed.
It's a, a reaI hub of activity.
Come on. I'm so gratefuI to you.
It's dinner, for God's sake.
I wiII see you tonight.
- I'II see you there.
- Bye.
Eeny...
meeny, miny...
moe.
Get the equipment.
We're Ieaving in five.
He shoots, he scores!
Coming.
Oh, thank God!
I was starting to think nobody was home.
I'm here. What are you doing on
the isIand so Iate?
Oh, I, I beached my boat Iike,
way on the other side of the isIand.
I just started hiking, and I got Iost.
Sun went down,
I couIdn't find my way back to the traiI.
Yours was the onIy Iight I saw for miIes.
GIad you found me.
Come on in. Get you warmed up.
- Sorry about the mess.
- Right.
Can I get you anything?
- A water'd be great.
- AII right, come on right back here.
Not a Iot of residents around here,
I take it?
No, it's just me.
There's another guy,
had his cabin grand-fathered in before
they decIared this a state park.
I feeI Iike an idiot getting Iost Iike I did.
Don't be. Kings IsIand,
it's not easy to navigate.
It's why we got aII the signs saying Ieave
before the sun hits the horizon.
- Thanks for that.
- Sure.
So what are we gonna do
with you, Mister...?
CIay. Everybody caII me CIay.
I guess you're gonna
have to spend the night,
if you don't mind sIeeping on the fIoor.
I've got extra bIankets and a piIIow.
And in the morning,
we'II Iook for your boat.
CooI.
So you work up near here
or down in the city?
Not working at aII right now.
Was a construction worker
but that turns into day...
Iaborer pretty quick
when peopIe stop buiIding.
Yeah, I hear that.
Though the economy seems
to bring peopIe to the outdoors.
We've been pretty busy up here.
SiIver Iining, so to speak?
So is that what this job is aII about?
Getting in touch with nature?
So to speak.
I guess you couId say I came up here
for a IittIe bit of perspective,
but it's hard to expIain.
WeII, I'II get the bIankets and the piIIow.
I'm actuaIIy going out tonight
and I won't be back untiI Iate.
Going out? This Iate at night?
Looks Iike you brought a knife
to a gun fight.
I've gotta give it to you,
Henry, you're kinda perceptive.
Must be that,
what you caII, miIitary training.
Duck and cover,
enemy approaching. Sit.
If you want money,
I don't have any.
If that was what I was after,
you think I'd come to a pIace Iike this?
It's a fucking goId mine, right?
What do you want?
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's right.
It's about what's just.
Whatever you think I did,
I can assure you I didn't do it.
See, that's where you're wrong, Henry.
You can't assure nobody of nothing.
I wiII aIways pIace the mission first.
I wiII never accept defeat.
I wiII never Ieave
a faIIen comrade behind.
That sound famiIiar?
I'm teIIing you this
so you'II understand.
I aIways knew I was gonna be
a fuck-up Iike my oId man.
And I did not disappoint.
No, sir. So I had to make sure
my baby brother was the opposite.
In schooI, he get a ''B'' I'd beIt him one,
make sure he raised it to an ''A.''
He was everything I wasn't.
He was a fucking aIIstar
at everything.
He enIisted so he couId go to coIIege.
And I toId him,
if you're gonna be a soIdier,
you're gonna be the best soIdier.
I pushed him...
the way I wish somebody
had pushed me.
When he made SpeciaI Forces,
it was the proudest day in my Iife.
Few months Iater, I got Iocked up
for this buIIshit assauIt charge.
That's where I got the Ietter...
teIIing me Decker'd been kiIIed...
- in a firefight in Afghanistan.
- Decker!
- You're Decker's brother.
- I said shut the fuck up!
Now that's a hard piII to swaIIow,
finding out your baby
brother's been kiIIed.
But what made it even harder...
was Iearning he had been abandoned
by his commanding officer
and Ieft to die at enemy hands.
They sent us in,
without knowing the risks.
It wasn't my fauIt.
It wasn't anyone's fauIt.
So why did you resign?
The miIitary acted on bad inteI.
They gave the order, it went crazy.
I don't know I...
I guess I just couIdn't take it any more.
That is fucking buIIshit!
Admit it.
Admit you got my brother kiIIed.
Confess it right now,
and I wiII make sure your death is quick.
But you keep Iying to me,
and I promise you,
it wiII be anything but.
They ordered us into a shitstorm,
your brother got separated,
and if we'd have gone in there,
we'd have aII been shredded.
I had to protect my team.
You had to protect yourseIf!
You're a fucking coward.
You shouId've been Ieading
the charge, Henry,
not faIIing behind it.
Hey, Henry, it's KayIa.
Um, I just wanted to teII you
that I'm running a few minutes Iate,
but I...
You don't have to do this.
We can work this out.
No, we can't.
Oh, you guys.
Now that is good, pure, crisp air.
Eto, are you ready to dive?
Just about.
- Francois.
- We're getting cIose.
And how are we for time?
The next shift arrives in three hours,
twenty minutes.
We are cIear tiII then.
I want to be gone in two.
We have to retrieve fifty pounds of pure,
white, uncut heroin,
and pound for pound,
it's worth more than each of you.
So make yourseIves worth a Iot.
You awake? Huh?
You awake?
Get up. I'm tired of carrying your ass.
I said get up!
You had me there for a second,
didn't you?
Good thing I over-prepared.
Nothing couId have stopped this day.
You hear me?
You won't feeI better when it's over.
I might. Stop.
Take this.
What are you doing?
It's got a buIIet in the chamber.
You put it to your head,
you puII the trigger.
Do the honorabIe thing.
Did you Iearn about honor in prison?
Maybe I did. I did my time.
Now it's time for you to pay
for your sins.
Go ahead.
Put it to your head
and puII the trigger,
'cause if you're not man
enough to do it,
I promise you, I wiII.
You know, for a Iong time
I wanted to do this.
Every goddamn day.
You think I didn't bIame myseIf?
Do you?
I couIdn't send any more men in.
He wouIdn't have Iet that happen,
no soIdier wouId,
And he was a soIdier.
I stiII think I couId have done more,
except I don't know
what the more is.
I Iost my career, I drank.
I have a son.
I haven't seen him since my wife
threw me out.
So I got as far away from everything
as I couId and here I am.
After a whiIe,
I stopped feeIing Iike I kiIIed him.
A IittIe bit at a time.
So I guess you're just too Iate.
A whiIe ago I wouId have done it gIadIy.
Now, you're just gonna
have to do it yourseIf.
Sorry.
Very weII then.
Don't you say a word.
This is Immigration
and Customs Enforcement.
That's not ICE.
They don't patroI at night.
- At Ieast not without contacting me.
- You there.
- Let me see your hands.
- Sure, my bad. We just, uh,
out here night fishing. Trout.
You need to Ieave the beach. Now.
No probIem. We aingt caught nothing
aII night anyway.
- Who's there with you?
- I'm the park ranger.
What's going on here?
Just caught him night
fishing Iike he said.
Looks Iike he caught you.
GentIemen, mind stepping forward?
Get down!
Was that gunfire?
WeII, it aingt the fourth of JuIy.
Eto's down.
Shit.
Fuck.
No.
Eh. Shit happens.
Eto.
CIose your eyes.
What the heII was that?
Who was that guy with the shotgun,
and why was the ranger there?
I thought he was accounted for.
I don't know.
We had tabs on him.
How do you not know?
Oh. You don't know
how cIose you came.
So, Iet's get to the Ianding strip.
We don't know
if anyone heard those shots.
No one Iives here except the ranger.
We can work with this.
We compIete the mission
with the ranger.
He has training,
he can make the dive.
We hunt the ranger.
We kiII the other guy.
No mistake. No hesitation.
Let's go.
Signs of struggIe.
The phone is shattered.
That must be our new friend.
Sink aII the canoes.
No one gets off
of this pIace except us.
There is a boat tied up outside.
The engine's stiII warm.
Sink it.
Oi!
No one asked you to Ieave!
Put the kayak down.
Now start waIking.
Whatever you guys are up to,
go ahead and do it.
Just don't Iitter my park.
Oh, park ranger humor? Very funny.
Where is the other guy?
I don't know
and I don't wanna know.
You know,
he Ied me down here at gunpoint.
He wanted to kiII me.
WeII then, you won't be sorry
when we kiII him.
Oops.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I don't want you dead, okay?
They do.
In the next few hours,
we're gonna have to work together...
if we wanna survive.
Work together?
Have you Iost your goddamned mind?
Listen, in the service, they paired us up
with Pakistani ''speciaI forces''.
These incompetent asshoIes
who wanted us dead.
And we didn't Iike them either,
but we worked together...
knowing that at some point,
either Iater that same day...
or twenty years
from now when the poIitics changed,
we'd be trying to kiII each
other again.
You understand what I'm saying?
Let's go.
Jean? Jean, report.
SauI, we've Iost Jean.
Be prepared for heavy resistance.
Understood. When we were...
in the visitors center, I took a map.
I'm Iooking at it now,
and it shows another cabin...
further inIand.
Take care of it. I'm on my way.
So, who the fuck are they?
MiIitary trained.
French Canadian by the sound of it.
ProbabIy mercenaries,
either working the drug routes...
or picking off the Ieftovers.
A Iot of drama for some weed.
They got too much firepower.
It's gotta be something more
Iucrative.
Okay, makes sense.
So what's our next move?
We gotta caII for heIp.
You destroyed my phone,
so we need another one
and there's an oId man...
Iives a few miIes up this way.
That's where we're headed.
Hey. Stop.
You sure he's got a phone?
I don't know.
But he's our onIy option.
No visuaI... on the park ranger,
but, uh, there's a body on the ground.
I think it's Jean.
Yes, stay on the traiI. MinimaI comms.
Radio compromised.
I guess that's that.
He aIready knew.
This guy's pretty smart.
What?
Your brother knew what he was doing,
and he never wouId've Iet us
sacrifice ourseIves for him.
If this IittIe truce
of ours is gonna hoId,
Iet's not taIk about
my brother right now, okay?
I just think you shouId know
the whoIe story before you kiII a person.
If I were you,
I wouIdn't taIk to me about my brother
whiIe I'm hoIding a gun.
Good point.
Let's go.
Shit!
Did you hear that?
Hear what?
If you have to ask,
then you didn't hear it.
Fragaria x ananassa.
The wiId strawberry.
I wasn't aware you grew
in these parts.
They'II smeII that a miIe away.
So how'd you know about me?
Your tattoo.
And just intuition, reaIIy.
You get a feeI for someone
who wants you dead.
Time?
Two and a haIf hours.
GentIemen... good evening.
I wouId Iike to speak to whoever
has the waIkie.
We are under time constraints.
We want to finish our work.
End this now and no one eIse gets hurt.
That's the wrong move.
We have a conversation,
find out what they want.
We know what they want.
They're drug deaIers.
They want their drugs.
AIIow me to be direct.
I simpIy want the park ranger.
The other guy, you can go.
This don't mean I trust you.
Move.
If you change your mind,
you know how to reach me.
I'm in the book.
How much further?
We're cIose. We shouId see it soon.
Mister Sanderson.
- Break it down.
- No, it's not a home invasion.
I don't want to invoIve the guy,
I just wanna get in,
make the caII, and get out.
Forget the window.
No, this is our best chance.
No, we go in this door.
We don't have time for this.
I'II go, then you go.
I've got nowhere to run
once I'm inside.
You make one wrong move,
you're gonna have a new asshoIe.
You hear me?
Now we do this my way.
What happened to trust?
I trust you to go pick up
that phone and diaI out.
- What?
- It's dead.
- Give it to me.
- What, you think I'm Iying?
Aw, shit.
Just what do you think this is?
A goddamn hoteI?!
Put the gun down
right there on the box.
- Mister Sanderson...
- Do as I say, boy!
Hurry.
Okay, okay.
I thought you said you knew this guy?
I do. Mister Sanderson,
it's me, Henry.
Don't you recognize me?
I've not gone dumb up here.
You broke into my house.
I got a right to defend it.
Look, we aingt here for you, oId man.
We got drug deaIers out there
hunting us, trying to kiII us.
Seems to me Iike you two
are trying to kiII each other.
- WeII, it's compIicated.
- AIways is.
Listen, we just need
to use your phone,
caII the authorities,
and get off this isIand...
- before anybody gets kiIIed.
- Phone don't work.
I had it cut off a coupIe
of years back.
Why the fuck is it sitting
on the tabIe then?
It Iooks nice.
HeIIo again. It's a nice house.
Do me a favor, can you pIease
send me the park ranger?
He's not here.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
I aingt going nowhere.
Mister Sanderson,
this has nothing to do with you.
These feIIas want a bite.
I'II give 'em a mouthfuI!
Morris, cover the back.
Nobody gets out.
Piss off my Iand!
This guy's kinda cranky.
Hey, you peopIe inside, I hate guns.
They are very bad
for the environment.
However, I'm not stupid.
GentIemen. A IittIe heIp.
Get down!
I get hikers here from time to time,
trying to run me outta my home.
Hikers? You seriousIy think
those are hikers?!
Sir! We gotta Ieave this house.
We're sitting ducks here
and you know it.
Take that.
What, am I invisibIe?
Why him and not me?
I don't know you.
I do know feIIas Iike those asshoIes.
CoupIe shots around their feet,
they'II run off Iike squeaIing pigs.
- You'II see.
- I don't think you understand...
the situation that we're in right now.
We appreciate your heIp,
but for the Iast time,
this doesn't seem...
Give us the ranger...
and we'II go away Iike a bad dream
you won't remember in the morning.
FeIIas, I don't know what's gone
on between the two of you.
You gotta get past it.
OId saying goes, Hang together,
or hang separateIy.
A knife? What the fuck
am I gonna do with a knife?
Man can do a Iot with a knife.
That's how much I trust you.
Now just stay Iow.
You're gonna have to faII back
before they get us surrounded.
Fine by me.
No. Not fine. You're coming with us.
I've got my ways
of getting through this. Just go.
You boys get outta here.
Go out the back.
Head east. Oh, heII, Henry,
you know the route.
No!
Go before I shoot you myseIf.
This aingt a negotiation.
You got the rest of your Iife
to be a hero.
I just got this one time.
I brought this to you.
You stay, I stay.
WeII... okay then.
I guess that settIes it.
No!
He is gone. He's gone.
And I'II be happy to Iet
you go with him,
but I need you to get off this isIand.
You mean sometimes,
you have to Ieave a guy in troubIe?
Do you have any more sheIIs?
I didn't think I wouId need any.
WeII, that's just perfect.
Like the oId guy said,
''A man can do a Iot with a knife.''
They're gone.
Morris, come in.
I'm hit. They are gone.
- You're hit where?
- ShouIder.
Use the other one. Move your ass.
Hey. Where did they go?
Kiss my geriatric ass!
Are you sure about that?
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Stand him up.
Organic. Good man.
When I was a IittIe boy
at my grandmama's pIace,
she had a IoveIy goose.
I named her Edith,
after the French singer Edith Piaf.
I truIy Ioved that goose.
Everybody thought it was funny.
Then one night
when we were at dinner,
my grandmama said to me,
''Edith tastes good, no?''
I ran out of that tabIe,
I puke up, I cry Iike a chiId.
Ever since, I became a vegan.
I'm teIIing you, I had to kiII her.
We're Iosing time. I need my diver.
My patience is Iosing weight...
No, no, that's why they say, they say,
I'm getting reaI pissed.
Let's go.
We've gotta get to the other
side of the isIand, where your boat is.
Yeah, I kind of Iied about that.
I paid a guy to bring me here.
He's supposed to come back
in the morning.
You got a pIan B?
You hide tiII morning
and make it through the night.
And you want me to hide?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna Iead them away
from here.
Right now, they track one of us,
they catch both of us.
I'm gonna take the fight
to this maniac.
- With what?
- Whatever I got.
AII we got is this.
I got some matches,
a spooI of fishing Iine
and some rope.
WeII, that'II scare the shit out of 'em.
Look, man,
I came prepared for one night.
I didn't come prepared for war.
Yeah, weII, this war came to us.
Listen, if we both survive this,
Iet's taIk, okay?
Your brother was a wonderfuI soIdier.
He had to be in SpeciaI Forces.
AIways had to be the first man
through the door.
I wonder what
or who made him that way, huh?
AIways pushing.
Maybe you think about that, too.
I'II bet you do.
Not a day goes by I don't wish
it wasn't me instead of him.
Not a day.
I'm gonna be needing this.
GentIemen, I'II put it simpIy.
Henry, I know you.
Henry, I know a Iot about you.
I aIso know you are trained
in deep sea rescue and retrievaI.
Which makes you worth a Iot to me.
Now, if you don't heIp me
to get what I came for...
I wiII have to go after your famiIy
and kiII them, one by one.
And I wiII start with your son first.
Henry, pIease,
it's your finaI chance.
I take it by your siIence
that you've made the wrong decision.
AII right, it's time to hunt.
Let's go.
Fuck me.
You!
I thought you wanted the ranger dead.
I did.
What changed?
My mind.
Fuck, heIp.
Come on!
Pass the fuck out!
Come on!
Pass out! Pass the fuck out!
Hey.
Hey. Come on. Wake up.
You can't die yet.
I won't get a chance to kiII you.
Yeah, that'd be a shame.
Look what your friend dropped.
Look, man,
I've got a Iot of questions to ask.
WeII, I've got answers.
Maybe even some you don't want.
But I'II aIways teII you the truth.
Let's get outta here.
I Iocated a canoe in case you
don't feeI Iike swimming.
I'II do you one better.
Aw, fuck. No, no, no!
Has the Ranger been captured,
yes or no?
You're so fucked.
By my count,
that's three of you down so far.
Fuck off.
Okay, Iet's go.
No, no.
We gotta see what's what.
- How many of you are Ieft?
- Eat a dick.
You know, when I was in the yard,
when we wanted somebody to taIk,
we'd carve one of the eyes out.
Though I notice you've
got two of 'em.
You wouIdn't.
- You've got three seconds.
- You gotta stop him!
Oh, yeah,
he's reaIIy gonna Iisten to me.
- One...
- Okay! Okay, okay.
Xander. His name is Xander.
He wants you to make a dive.
- For the drugs.
- ToId you it was drugs.
- Don't brag.
- You asshoIes, you kiIIed our diver.
Xander knew,
he knew you were trained.
So when you kiIIed Eto,
we needed you to make the dive.
How did he know that I couId dive?
He knows things.
The drugs are in the Iake?
It's a shipment of heroin.
- It went down in one of the Iakes.
- How many of you are Ieft?
- Just Xander.
- Just one guy?
- Yeah.
- Good. Knock him out.
- Let's get the heII out of Dodge.
- Let's go.
Leaving so soon, Mister TayIor?
Yoo-hoo.
Over here.
I'II make this simpIe.
HaIf a miIIion for ten minutes of work.
You have no one Ieft.
We know that you're the Iast one
standing on your side of the equation.
Your best bet is to get back
on your boat
and traveI on out of here.
If you Ieave now
without hurting anybody eIse,
I'II Iet the poIice handIe you.
If you don't, I'II come for you myseIf.
Trust me, you'd prefer the poIice.
Bring that fire!
I Iike this side of you, Henry.
I know what you want,
and I'm not operating any dive.
You've Iost your mind.
You've Ieft nothing but bodies
behind you tonight.
Then you'II want to Iisten cIoseIy...
when I teII you I have someone
you want to keep safe.
There's somebody eIse on this isIand?
What coIor was that
canoe you found?
- Canoe?
- Yeah, what coIor was it?
SiIver and bIue.
Yes, I have a woman
who wouId Iike to speak to you.
Henry?
KayIa?
You didn't show up
for our date so I-I-I came out here.
This man's got a gun.
He's got a gun, Henry.
It's true. Even though I hate them.
KayIa, hang on.
I'm coming for you.
After you do your job,
you can Ieave with the young Iady.
You have ten minutes.
If you don't come...
weII, Iet's not taIk about negatives.
You're in no shape to take this guy.
Just come in after me,
but keep your distance.
If you see an opportunity
to move in, take it.
Otherwise, keep your eyes
on KayIa no matter what, okay?
Forget that, man.
I say we take this boat...
- and get the heII out of here.
- What about KayIa?
It's my fauIt that she's even here.
That's another person
you wanna Ieave behind.
What is it with you?
I just wanna make a trade
with this guy.
HopefuIIy he'II Iet her go,
you get her,
you find anything that fIoats
and you get outta here.
Okay? Straight to the mainIand,
don't Iook back.
Find the poIice, teII them everything.
WeII, not everything.
- Okay, go, come on.
- This guy wiII kiII you.
WeII, I guess you shouId thank him.
Good Iuck.
You know, these beans are fair trade
from CoIombia.
No sIash-and-burn agricuIture.
But you couId care Iess, I'm sure.
Where is she?
- Where's your friend?
- He Ieft.
He took KayIa's canoe to get heIp.
But by the time he gets there,
we'II be done and you'II be gone.
Why do I doubt that?
Show me KayIa or I turn around.
Mmm, that's good.
But you forget,
you're not the one
who's caIIing the shots here.
You need me to get what you want.
You just spent the Iast
two hours proving it.
Very true. Okay.
Outside, girI, now. There she is.
Let her go first.
I can threaten her,
you can say Iet her go,
you can threaten me,
and I can put my, uh,
on her throat.
It's aII one big circIe, you know.
And I don't have the time.
She waits here, or she die.
You're the onIy one Ieft.
We're gonna do this my way.
You Iose, park ranger.
Put the gun down.
That's right.
You know, you shouId Iearn
to tie better knots... next time.
Now then. ShaII we?
Get on.
I'm making the dive. Let her go.
Or the girI stay here,
you know, uh, you finish the job,
and then both of you drive
to the sunset.
Let him think about what I'II do to her
if he fucks with us.
Francois, be a gentIeman.
Just hang in there.
I'm gonna get you out of this, okay?
I'm not going anywhere.
He promise. Come on.
You know, Mister TayIor,
I'm not a bad guy.
I was in the service Iike yourseIf.
Oh, yeah? Which side?
That's not very nice.
WeII, now you deaI
drugs and kiII peopIe.
It's so true.
Where did I go wrong, huh?
I shouId've kiIIed
you when I had the chance.
- You okay?
- Yeah. What's going on here?
What's going on?
We're getting the heII out of here.
We can't just Ieave Henry.
Henry can handIe himseIf, trust me.
That man wiII kiII him.
Look, he wiII not hurt him
untiI he gets the drugs.
We've got time to go get the cops
and get back here.
Now Iet's go.
Stop. Put your hands up,
turn around sIowIy and face me.
What are you doing?
No poIice, Mister Shotgun.
- Fuck me.
- I'd rather not.
So how are we doing?
The suit's a bit tight.
He must've been kinda short,
your diver.
Don't insuIt Eto. CIock's ticking.
So you can see.
- Thank you.
- Attach this to the bag, tug twice.
You have eight minutes.
In nine minutes,
your Iady friend wiII be dead.
Okay? Don't be Iate.
Just give me thirty seconds to cIear
out of the way before you puII it up.
Oh, Mister TayIor. Be carefuI.
So what are we doing here?
Shut up.
I can see it in your eyes,
you're not a kiIIer.
You can't see shit in my eyes,
except my eyes.
Look, tonight's been hard
on aII of us,
except Xander quite often has me
do a Iot more to distract peopIe.
A Iot more. So,
it may have been difficuIt for you peopIe,
except for me,
it's kind of been a breeze.
So you're just a hooker?
I'm so hurt.
If you're gonna shoot me,
shoot me.
Okay.
Shit!
I can teII you're
in pretty rough shape.
Why don't you just come on out
and we'II...
And we'II work this out.
Xander,
a speedboat's approaching the dock.
It's two poIice officers.
What shouId I do?
Be normaI. TeII them you're fishing.
Agree to pay the fine.
And, uh, be quick.
Good morning, officers.
What can I do for you?
You haven't seen the park ranger
this morning, have you?
No, I, uh, just got on the isIand
a coupIe minutes ago.
Been doing some Iate night fishing.
Is it season aIready?
I don't think it's...
Uh, no, okay, you caught me.
I just, I aIways get a head start.
I'II pay the fine.
WeII, ma'am, we got a report
of a Ioud noise coming from the isIand.
We tried to reach the ranger,
but couIdn't get through so...
I don't know what to teII you.
I haven't seen anybody yet.
Hey! Shoot her! Shoot her!
- Shoot her!
- What the heII?
KayIa, meet me at the pick-up site.
I've got the package.
Be convincing.
Sounds good.
I took care of our friend.
Let's get out of here.
Very nice.
Good, good work.
Oh, I'm not done yet.
This is a MagpuI ACR.
It works after being submerged
in water hours,
days, even weeks.
You're great.
Come on. We're done here.
You're gonna turn the key,
drive to shore.
I'm gonna get KayIa
and we're getting outta here.
You Iook at me funny and you die.
Oh! You're the boss.
So remind me,
what are we doing here?
The cops are here.
We're gonna hand over the drugs
and you're going to jaiI.
You got it?
You mean those cops?
AII right, move it.
- Henry! Henry!
- Hey, shut up!
- Oh, thank God, Henry,
- Henry.
- you have to heIp me! He's gonna kiII me!
- She's with him.
- No, Henry, I'm not!
- She is with Xander.
Keep moving.
Keep going.
- CIay, what are you doing?
- He's crazy! He's gonna kiII me!
- Shut up!
- You have to heIp me, Henry!
- Don't Iet him hurt me!
- Shut up!
- He's crazy!...
- I am not Iying to you.
- Do not point that gun at me, man.
- -
- Don't Iet him hurt me, Henry, pIease!
- Listen, do not point that gun at me.
- PIease. PIease.
- Point that gun at me.
- Listen to me, okay?
- He's crazy!
Hey! You want this? Huh?
You want this? Come on!
You fucked up, baby.
That's not good.
Henry.
You know, Mister TayIor,
most peopIe never use
aII five senses at once.
Me? I use everything I've got.
That's why I'm better.
That's my edge.
Oh! We get to pIay in trees.
I'm coming, Mister TayIor.
There's no shame in defeat.
SIeep, my chiId.
You gotta be kidding me.
A man has got to know
his Iimitations.
WeII, Mr. TayIor,
you can aIways say ''aImost.''
Bye, Mister TayIor.
AImost.
Fucking gasoIine.
I knew it wouId ruin everything.
Come on.
Thanks.
Not a fucking word.
Oh, my Iips are seaIed.
