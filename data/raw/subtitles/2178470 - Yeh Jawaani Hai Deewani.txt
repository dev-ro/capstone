Sometimes the smallest of things...
...trigger memories so
strange and so beautiful...
...that they leave us speechless...
Memories are a funny thing...
The small pieces of our past.
They are always safe in our memories.
Memories are like chocolate boxes...
Once open...
...yöu can't stop at just one.
What are yöu looking at?
Watch TV if yöu want
something to stare at!
Pardon me?
Pardon me it seems!
I caught yöu staring!
Never seen sexy legs before?
I have. These aren't sexy.
I'll slap yöu!
Say yöu're sorry!
Say yöu're sorry!
Sorry.
Go stand at that other counter.
Idiot.
Naina... Naina Talwar?
Hi Aditi.
What's up dude?
Good.
Is this a friend of yöurs?
Hi Aunty! I'm Aditi.
Naina and I were in school together.
Long time, huh?
Let's go.
What are yöu doing these days?
Nothing much...
What do yöu mean nothing?
She's studying MEDICINE...
Wow!
At KEM College, Mumbai!
Top ranked in her class!
Rocking ya!
yöu're the same, Naina.
She was number one
in school also, Aunty!
That's true.
What are yöu studying?
Arts, Aunty...
Studying's not my thing...
Thank God we're on vacation now.
What are yöur vacation plans?
I'm going to Manali... Tomorrow!
Family vacation?
Mom!
No, Aunty. With friends...
Aye Naina, yöu know them!
Bunny and Avi?
From school?
Avinash yo! My best friend?
And Bunny. Kabir Thapar?
That lecture-bunking slacker!
Anyway, Naina...
Great seeing yöu, dude!
Aunty... take it easy!
Yes, yes... very easy.
Excuse me, ma'am...
yöur friend left this behind.
Sorry, can yöu repeat that?
How many children do yöu have?
I'm not going to keep
repeating myself...
This foreigner has been
chattering for too long.
Why are yöu frightening
these poor guys?
Answer the question?
yöu're new around here...
What are they to yöu?
Internship.
What?
I'm working for them.
They look like hippies!
They're very important people...
They make travel shows
all over the world...
Really?!
They're from Argentina!
What's Argentina?
yöu know... just some tiny village.
Will yöu take me there?
Of course, my darling...
Now answer their question!
I have two children...
Now don't ask me
who their fathers are!
Welcome ladies and gentlemen...
Hold on to yöur seats...
We are about to present...
Agra's most celebrated possession...
The queen of beauty,
grace and sensuality...
Mohini!
Eyes like jewels...
Ruby red lips...
Bid yöur senses goodbye, tonight!
Get out while yöu can, my friends...
Or weep tomorrow morning!
How many truly know the value
of grace, desire, and passion?
Okay, tell me this...
Can I get a discount
for all three at once?!
yöung man...
Don't take beauty so lightly...
Lest beauty get the better of yöu...
yöu're mischievous, good-looking,
But yöu are only a boy...
When will yöu learn the
difference between boys and men?
We ran into Naina's friend today.
What a sight she was.
Dirty, torn clothes...
...and these giant
headphones around her neck.
Totally weird... wild!
Nothing like that, dad...
What do yöu know?
Take it from me,
this friend of yöurs has no future.
Mom!
For one, she's not my friend.
And everyone doesn't
have the same priorities.
Not everyone dreams of being a doctor!
Like anyone would
even make her a nurse!
At least she's enjoying her life.
yöung girls who have too much fun,
end up pregnant...
And then spend their
lives feeling miserable.
Well I'm miserable right now.
At least finish yöur food!
I'm not hungry.
What's gotten into yöu today!
I'm fed up, mom!
Of this STUPID life!
That Aditi is going on
a holiday with her friends...
I study so much I can't even
give myself a break on Sundays!
And then yöu guys with
yöur constant nagging!
So... yöu... want to go on a holiday?
MOM!!!
There's food in the oven...
And I've brought yöu mangoes.
They're in the fridge.
Why haven't yöu gone to bed yet?
I was reading...
In the dark?
Don't lie.
Oh, I'm the liar?
Yes, Dad.
yöu were waiting for me to come home.
yöu should sleep early.
If I sleep on time,
when will I see yöu?
Tomorrow morning
yöu're off to Manali!
Yeah, so?
Manali?
And I'm the liar. Very good.
Trekking expedition to Khipshi Pass.
16,000 feet above sea level...
...a highly daunting
and high octane adventure.
Why did yöu enter my room?
This is the limit, Dad!
What were yöu checking for? Drugs?
Bunny, don't shout.
Hello, stepmom.
yöu told us yöu're
going to Lonavala...
This sherbet is terrible.
...but yöu're going to Manali...
for a trek.
yöu're making a habit
of these weird hobbies.
It's weird to yöu, not to me.
We don't have as much money
as yöur friends' parents...
Save money. It'll help yöu.
I'm doing this with my own money.
I respect yöur melodrama
but yöu're not my mother.
So please...
I'm going to Manali tomorrow.
That's it.
Nice.
Is the colour alright?
Why are yöu always lecturing me?
I want to live life on my own terms.
Because I worry about yöu...
When yöu become a father...
- I don't want to be anyone's father!
Why did yöu lie?
Dad! yöu stay up all
night if I sleep over at Avi's!
I didn't want yöu to worry...
If yöu don't want me to worry then
don't go off to climb this mountain!
Is it really that necessary?
Extremely.
Thanks for the bag. I love it.
Take care of my son, okay?
And have lots of fun!
I will.
"Good chance for Kaif
here to get some runs..."
"In the air... taken!"
Aye, man!
This idiot should be dropped!
Get off me, Aditi!
How, handsome?
yöu're so hot when yöu're angry!
Aditi, not now!
This match is very stressful.
So stressful that
yöu forgot to pick me up?
Why should I pick yöu up?
Are yöu a child?
Are yöu going to be kidnapped?
Don't be over smart.
Come on, the train is here.
I don't want to go
for this stupid trek.
What?!
Why not, man?
What happened to all those
plans of picking up mountain chicks?
I can't miss the India-Pakistan
series over all this.
We're screwed, man.
yöu're right.
India needs yöu, bro.
Let's go, Adi.
Seriously? But...
yöu'll are really leaving me behind?
Yeah. yöu don't want to come...
Don't come.
Of course I want to come, man.
But how? yöu blew up all yöur money!
How did yöu know?
yöu bloody bookie...
I know a lot more than yöu think!
yöu bet all yöur pocket
money on this match, right?
Go... yöu guys have fun.
Oho, tragedy queen! Stop this drama.
What are my savings for? Let's go.
No.
yöu've worked for that money, Bunny.
Just save it.
Money is nothing!
Money's for spending, not saving!
The three of us are
going on this trip!
Come on!
Come on!
We're going to kill it in Manali!
Our names will be in
their history books forever!
Not a single mountain
girl shall be spared!!
Hi guys. I'm Sumer,
yöur trip leader from 'Make My Trip'.
Train leaves in 20 minutes.
Meena... Tea!
Ma?
First of all, don't freak out...
I'm very very sorry
to do this to yöu...
Hey... Here.
Nah, not hungry.
It's ham and cheese! yöur favorite!
I had to wake up at 6 to make them!
Are yöu mad, Aditi?
Give...
Hi Uncle.
Hi.
Where's Bunny?
Excuse me...
...sorry I'm late but...
Hey... yöu?
Aisha, right?
We met at Tanya's party?
Naina... Naina Talwar?
Geetanjali's cousin!
Modern School. Same batch.
Ohhhh yaaaa...
Scholar Naina!
How could I forget these glasses?
Long time, man! How are yöu?
Very late! Where's Sumer?
Sumer...
Wait...
...yöu're coming with us?
Yes. Why?
yöu know this is a trek, right?
So?
yöu'll have to climb mountains...
...sleep in tents...
There'll be bears at night!
I know what a trek is!
Okay bro.
Naina?
Hi! Sumer. - Hi.
I'm sorry but it's too
late for yöu to join us.
The train is full.
Can't anything be done? Please...
I'll sleep on the floor!
Sleep with me.
Not WITH me... we'll take turns.
We'll bribe the TC.
Okay. Done. Quickly... let's go!
My bags!
I'm not a porter.
Ask me nicely.
Please help me, Kabir.
Bunny.
Do I need to carry yöu also?
Yo, Scholar!
What are yöu calculating? Let's go!
Naina! What will Ganpatiji
do without yöu in Manali?
I've...
...never been anywhere alone before.
Then come now!
Trust me, nothing will happen...
It'll be fun!
Come on.
Okay.
Are yöu stalking me?
Oh shut up, Aditi.
Aditi fantasizes about all
the girls in the world stalking her.
I'm going to kill yöu.
Remember, Aditi? We used
to toss to sit behind Topper Naina!
Whoever won was guaranteed
to pass his exams!
Superb! - Aye Naina?
Please eat! Come on eat!
Hi guys...
Got a knife?
Knife! Yes! Definitely! One second.
Right here somewhere!
Don't have. Sorry.
I should've brought bananas...
I've got a...
...knife.
Give me...
What'll yöu give me in return?
What would yöu like?
yöur...
...name.
Lara...
Bunny.
yöu know, like, Bugs Bunny?
Oh my God! That's so cute!!!
Hi! I'm Avi!
Hi...
Are yöu guys also going
for this trek to Manali?
Lf that's where yöu'll be,
where else could we go?
And what will this
fruit do for yöu, darling?
Come, let's have lunch?
Yeah... We have ham
and cheese sandwiches...
Are yöu sure?
Oh I'm very sure...
Sharing is caring...
Okay I'll go get my friends!
Priti! Esha!
Yes!!! She's got friends!
How dare yöu
offer her my sandwiches?!
What now?
"Sharing is caring..."
yöu should be happy, Aditi!
There's three of them!
One for Bunny, one for me and...
...one for yöu!
Aditi, please change the song!
Lt's so boring!
Ladies... and bro.
Let's get this party started!
Drinks!
Okay now we're going
to play my favourite game...
It's called I Never!
Hey that's my favorite game!
Same pinch, cuckoo.
Come on, everyone take a drink
and let's start... Scholar Naina!
No, yöu guys play...
Now that yöu're here,
yöu have to play. Here!
Actually, I don't drink alcohol.
WHAT?
Would the bottles not topple
if the high were in the liquor?
Meaning?
Nothing. Here...
Take this Appy.
Today we'll make yöu Happy on Appy!
Okay, everyone knows the rules, right?
I'm going to say something
that I've never done...
Like... I've never sat in a rickshaw.
Everyone who's done it has to
take a sip of his or her drink. Cool?
Very good!
Let's start!
Okay, I'll start.
I've never been in love.
Every day.
Every single day.
Bunny?
yöu've never been in love?
No... - What? - But I
think that's about to change...
Please! Bunny only loves himself.
Naina? - No.
Okay.
I've never... watched porn.
Every day!
But Naina yöu're a biology student!
Even then yöu haven't seen?
I've never...
...been arrested!
Drunk driving!
Beating up a watchman!
Rave party!
I was there too!
Peeing on the sidewalk.
No.
Okay, my turn...
I've never...
...been kissed.
Oh we can change that right now.
I'm going to sleep, guys... Goodnight.
Aye not yet. yöur turn!
No... Please.
Can I use the seat for a bit, Bunny?
Of course.
Thanks.
Okay...
...I've never hit on a friend's mom!
That's because he hits on their dads!
Aditi...
Aditi, wake up!
Adi, we are going to see Manali.
Wake up.
I'm too sleepy, Bunny!
Bunny, I'll break yöur face!
Screw yöu!
Come on.
Aditi...
What a pretty bride!!!
Wish I could marry her myself.
What?!
Just think...
She'll say something
and I won't understand.
Then I'll say something and
she'll blush without understanding...
Dude, she's not French.
She must know basic hindi.
Besides, she's a kid!
She should be playing games,
not managing a house!
Really? How do yöu know?
This is normal in small towns.
The second yöu finish school,
they want to get yöu married.
Arranged marriages suck, dude!
yöu're going to have
a love marriage then?
Obvio!
Lt's still illegal for two
girls to get married in India...
...yöu'll have to go to New York, Aditi!
What?
That poor girl has been sentenced for
life and yöu'll are cracking jokes.
Come on, dude.
Today is the last
yöu'll see her smile.
In two years...
...yöu'll find her chasing her husband
with a gun outside this temple!
Bridezilla attacks!
Ignore him, Naina.
Bunny's allergic to marriage.
True.
Naina, tell me something.
If I make yöu eat the
same boring food everyday...
would yöu be able to?
Huh?
Marriage is like boiled
food for 50 years till yöu die.
Life's gotta have some spicy curry...
hamburgers...
...and hakka noodles!!!
The basic concept of
marriage is flawed.
Better to never get married
than do it 5-6 times.
Five - six times!
Too few, no?
What if yöu want kids?
What do kids have to do with it?!
We can make kids right now.
Come behind this temple.
I'll show yöu.
Idiot!
How many do yöu want?
I can make twins also!
She's feeling bad, man!
What all are yöu praying for?
Okay ask for me also!
A private jet...
A penthouse apartment in New York...
...two Spanish girlfriends...
Even better if they're twins!
Ask!
Hey! What are yöu doing?
Why did yöu touch me?
Excuse me?
yöu're drunk, yöu pervert!
What?! Have yöu seen yöur face?
I'm not blind!
Shut up, Avi!
yöu cheapo!
Aye, who are yöu calling names?
What? - I can think of a few for yöu!
Back off. yöu don't know who I am.
yöu don't know who I am.
Back off. Move!
Hey hero...
Drunk loser.
yöu...
Say sorry.
Say sorry.
Sorry.
Good. Learn to keep yöur cool.
Get lost.
Are yöu okay?
yöu okay, bro?
Guys!
Come on!
yöu think we're scared of yöu?
yöu guys don't know my friends!
We'll beat each one of yöu to pulp!
Ready, bro?
Ready. - Ready.
One...
two...
Jai Mata Di! - Jai Mata Di!
Catch them!
Aditi, come on!
- Why are we running away?!
Catch her! She's with them!
Don't let them escape!
Scholar, run!
Avi, what are yöu doing?
Move!!!
yöu go that way.
Help!
Let's run!
Leave me. - Aditi, what are yöu doing?
Come, yöu idiots!
I'm going to hit yöu so hard...
...no doctor will
be able to fix yöu!
Aditi come on man...
Oh God, I'm so sorry! I'm sorry!
Come on, RUN!
What's going on? - Careful.
What is this mess
yöu've gotten me into?
Relax, scholar.
I have a plan.
This is a very stupid idea!
Wait and watch!
Oh no!
yöu fool! Look at what yöu've done!
- Sorry, Uncle! Sorry!
We'll attack them from behind!
Aditi, yöu'll get us all killed!
Let me have one shot at them...
Please shhh!
I'll beat them so badly...
...they won't be able
to recognize each other!
Booze!
Hey! They're hiding over here!
Hey! Come on, yöu!
Aditi... - Hurry up!
Bunny! Naina! - Where have yöu been?!
Oh no! - Naina, sit!
No yöu don't!
They're behind us!
Get out of the way!
Hurry up. Come on!
Superb, Naina!
Good morning, everyone!
Our trek is finally about to begin!
Just for fun, I thought
that we should make two teams...
...and have a race to the campsite.
The team to reach
the camp first, wins.
The losing team has to put up the tents and make dinner...
...the winning team
gets to chill! Cool?
Who wants to be Captain?
yöu guys! Come on!
Come on. - Idiots!
Bunny! yöu're just sitting here!
We have to win!
Beating Bunny at trekking
isn't just impossible...
It's Mission lmpossible.
Don't worry, baby doll... Relax!
Oh good!
My body wasn't made for this stress...
Look what happened!
Oh no, baby!
Such a deep wound!
We should go to the hospital!
Really?!
But... how...
One second.
Come cuckoo.
What is this yöu're doing?
This is the...
Ajinomotato plant.
It's very good for yöur skin.
Oh really!
Then can yöu put some on my face?
Here...
Go ahead.
Bunny...
Yes, baby...
Who is that up there?
Bunny! Who IS that?
My mother!
Oh.
I didn't know his
mother was on this trek.
Naina, listen...
Just wait one second...
Let me win this race? Please?
Look at the state yöu're in!
I'll easily beat yöu.
Come on, Naina.
yöu used to be first
in everything in school...
Let me win here... PLEASE.
It's yöur own fault.
yöu can't win if yöu spend
all yöur time massaging girls' legs.
It's called 'flirting'...
It's good for health...
...like YOGA!
Seriously?
Have yöu come here to
climb mountains or girls?
That poor innocent girl
has hurt herself so badly!
Oh ya I've never seen a more
innocent girl than her in my life!
Don't yöu like Lara?
Look at her!
How perfectly she sways her hips...
Toing toing toing!
That's not all she's swaying!
That's true.
Naina!
Okay, listen!
Listen?
yöu're right.
Now sit down for a minute.
Sit. Please.
yöu're right.
I know she's a bit silly.
But I can't flirt
with girls like yöu...
so I have to make do with her.
Girls like me?
Girls like yöu aren't
made for flirting...
...yöu're made for love!
And love...
...is very bad for my health.
Bunny!
Bunny!!!
yöu cheat!!!
Try losing sometimes, Naina...
It has a magic of its own!
I'm going to complain
to the camp instructor!
This isn't school, Naina!
Ladies and gents!
Let's go!
Where to?
To a party, where else!
Group of Germans has set
up camp and we're invited!
What are we waiting for?
But why man?!
Shut up and come.
How are the girls?
Dynamite!
How sad!
No one ate yöur parathas!
Pack them up!
yöu shouldn't poke
around in the dark...
yöu never know what yöu'll find!
Seriously?
yöu're studying?
Lf yöu've managed to zip up,
please leave.
Why aren't yöu coming?
I have no interest
in yöur stupid party.
Liar.
yöu're dying to come.
Not at all!
Bunny!
Give it back, Bunny!
Bunny, give me my book!
Then be honest...
Do yöu want to come, or not?
Yes.
Then what's the problem?
yöu won't understand.
These things are easy for yöu.
What's easy?
This...
Going to parties, making friends...
yöu've always been like this.
Even in school...
...'the cool guy'...
everyone's favourite...
But do yöu remember
what I was like in school?
I had no friends, Bunny.
I just sat in a corner, and studied.
Bunking classes...
...making fun of teachers...
...chilling with friends...
I couldn't do it then
and I can't do it now...
Because... I'm boring!
yöu're very cool, Naina.
The way yöu showed up
on this trip last minute...
...with 25 strangers...
...all alone...
That needs guts.
yöu fight off thugs,
leave me behind in races,
sing mad songs...
yöu're a...
...full hindi film hero, dude!
Just stop feeling
so bad for yöurself...
...and start loving who yöu are.
yöu're fine...
...just the way yöu are.
There is one problem, though.
yöu don't smile enough.
Do yöu know how
dangerous yöur smile is?
Lf I had a heart,
I'd have lost it
to yöur smile ages ago.
Naina...
...are yöu planning
to let go of my hand?
So guys, this is Khipshi Pass.
Our trek's highest point!
Finally!
We'll be setting
up camp here tonight...
So yöu guys can relax!
Hey, Sumer!
What's up there?
That? That's Bhuta Mountain.
Let's go there!
What a view it'll be!
Bhuta...
Does anyone know what
'Bhuta' means? - No.
Bhuta means haunted.
According to the village elders,
there used to be an old
temple of the God 'Bhairav'.
They said any wish made there
on a full moon night, would come true.
Hundreds of people would
go there in search of this magic...
...but no one ever returned.
The temple no longer stands...
But they say on every full moon night,
thousands of spirits gather there...
Hoping for some kind
of miracle to occur.
Interesting thing is that tonight...
is a full moon night.
Still interested in that view?
What if the camp is haunted?
They say ghosts love the colour red...
And yöu...
Hey, Priti!
What's wrong, babe?
I'm right here!
I know all the chants
to get rid of ghosts.
Yeah, his father's an exorcist.
I want to go home!!!
I'm dying to get off
this stupid mountain!
I'm going to order 10
pizzas the second I'm home.
I'm sick of eating Maggi noodles!
yöu know I haven't washed
my hair in three days!
As soon as I get home...
I'm going to take a long bubble bath!
I'm only waiting to
get away from Avi's snoring.
Get used to it, bro!
What are yöu going to
do when we're roommates?!
Roommates?
Yeah dude.
We'll rent an apartment
and set it up...
like that TV show F.R.I.E.N.D.S.
Lara come take bubble baths anytime!
What happened?
yöu can stay in my room.
I'll get us a King-sized bed.
What if yöu snore?
Test drive tonight?
yöu'll get the best
sleep of yöur life.
Boo!
yöu shouldn't poke around in the dark,
yöu never know what yöu'll find!
What are yöu doing here, Naina?
Come on!
Lf there really was a temple here,
I have something to ask for.
Want to sit?
No no...
I don't get tired...
Not yöu,
I'm tired. Okay?
Got any booze?
WHAT?!
Lt's freezing... Just a little?
yöu're full of surprises tonight.
Don't tell anyone, okay?
Okay, enough... Control...
It's really nice! What is it?
Lugdi!
Made from fermented rice...
Manali's famous for it...
...and for Lugdi,
apples, trout and...
marijuana.
How do yöu know all this?
I'm not as stupid as I look.
Wait.
Read this.
Venice...
London...
Bunny, what is this?
This is my dream.
I want to see every
corner of the world, Naina.
All this will take a lifetime to do!
When will yöu do everything else?!
What else is there?
Student at 22,
employed at 25, husband at 26...
...father at 30,
retired at 60 and then...
...wait for yöur death.
Who wants to lead
such an ordinary life?!
So then...
what do yöu want from life, Bunny?
Adventure...
madness...
Every day so exciting...
...that I can feel my
blood rushing in my veins!
I want to fly, Naina!
I want to run, I'll even fall...
I just never want to... stop.
Like climbing this mountain...
It's just a random experience
for yöu but for me...
This is what I love for.
I got carried away, didn't I?
I never even say stuff
like this to Avi and Aditi...
Why am I telling yöu?
What would I know?!
yöu never even said
hi to me in school.
Okay then... I'll say it now...
Hi Naina.
Hi Naina...
Hi...
How are yöu, Naina?
There truly was something
miraculous about that mountain...
...and that miracle... was love.
I had never before felt
this kind of happiness...
I was in love...
And I wanted to scream
and tell the world...
...but most of all,
I wanted to tell him...
I don't know if there
was ever a temple here...
But I still made a wish...
A very simple wish...
In fact, just one word...
Bunny.
Hey Naina!
Aye scholar!
Who scholar?!
Lf only this night would never end.
Bunny, I have something to tell yöu...
I...
Bunny!
Bunny!
Bunny?
Adi!
Aditi are yöu okay?
Yeah. - Bunny!
What is this?
Where did yöu find that?
Read this.
yöu're ruining my surprise, man.
Surprise?
How could yöu keep
something like this from us?
This IS the surprise...
...and I wanted to break
it to yöu guys together...
...at the end of this trip!
yöu mean... yöu're leaving?
Journalism Program...
Accepted at Northwestern University...
Chicago.
Scholarship letter?
Yes.
yöurs?
Yeah man... mine.
yöu're really going?
No I keep the envelope around
because it matches my shirt.
So... when are yöu leaving?
In three weeks.
yöu should've told me before, man...
I'd have applied too!
And our apartment, liquor store...
all cancelled?
Avi!! We couldn't really
have run a liquor store!
What crap, Bunny!
What'll he do without us?
yöu'll drive yöurself mad
alone for 4 years in America!
yöu'll come running back!
Say something, Aditi!
Bunny, yöu should go!
yöu should definitely go!
How long can we go on like this?
We're growing up.
We need to stop being teenagers.
Congratulations, Bunny.
Avi...
I was going to tell yöu first, man.
Dad doesn't even know yet.
Forget it, man.
Congratulations!
yöu're happy, right? That's it.
Let's drink to this in the bus.
What?
What?
I'm scared...
Scared? yöu?
Life's going to change...
So?
My friends...
Aren't too happy, are they?
Who knows what Dad will say?
America's... far.
I'll be alone there.
And here?
Here... Feels nice.
But...
But?
But I...
But yöu...
...yöu want to fly...
...yöu want to run...
And what else?
I want to fall, too.
yöu can't eat boiled
food all yöur life.
yöu...
...I want to explore
every corner of the world.
This scholarship...
...will take me closer to my dreams.
I have to go, Naina!
I know.
yöu'll miss me?
Nah.
yöu were about to say something...
Just that...
...the night has ended.
I couldn't tell him.
Just...
...couldn't say it.
As much as I loved him...
...he loved his
dreams that much more.
I was hurt, but I was also grateful...
Grateful for the whole hoard
of memories I was taking with me...
...that I can never forget...
Those days, those nights...
The laughter,
the madness, the friendship...
Bunny.
He chased after his dreams so hard...
...that he was gone from
our lives in the blink of an eye.
It's been 8 years...
...he never turned back...
...and I didn't wait for him to.
yöu want something?
yöu think yöu're a smart guy, yöu dog?
Come on, what are yöu doing?
Take this!
Hi everyone! This is Riyana
Sarai for Fox Traveller!
We're back with another exciting
episode of Traveller Weekends!
I am standing in of the one of the
most romantic cities in the world...
Welcome to Paris!
What yöu looking at, Kabir?
Time pass us by.
Wow.
"Time passing us by..."
There's something about speaking
Hindi in a foreign land...
I don't know why, Kabir...
but yöu're making me miss home today.
Liar. Like yöu really miss home.
I do, but then...
...I forget.
Me and yöu are basically the same.
People like us are vagabonds...
For us, to wander is to live...
And that's why, the
moment we're back in San Francisco...
...yöu'll leave our company.
Am I right, or am I right?
Riya... To get somewhere,
yöu have to leave something behind...
It's best to leave
things at the right time...
Or yöu'll be left
with too many regrets...
Any idea what yöu'll do? Any plans?
The plan is... to not have a plan.
I'll figure something out...
...or else I'll trick
someone like yöu into hiring me.
Wait...
The channel wants to launch
a new show for the European market...
Kind of like a...
reality travel show!
The host will live in some
world famous cities for 3 months...
...and we'll shoot his experiences.
First year's line
up starts with Paris,
then Tokyo,
Istanbul, and we end in Berlin!
And yöu want me to shoot this show?
No...
I want yöu to host it.
Shut up!
Woah woah woah...
yöu're perfect, man.
yöu're smart, yöu're confident...
yöu're charming enough to make people
forget what an ass yöu really are!
Listen, jokes apart...
travel is yöur life!
Trust me... yöu're perfect!
What is there to consider, Kabir?
Say yes, babe!
Trust me, when yöu... Yes!
Yes!
Yes! - Say it again? Say it again?
Are yöu serious?! - I can't hear yöu.
Yes! - I can't hear yöu!
YES!
YES!!!
These stupid courier
guys returned my package...
...and completely ruined
my plans to surprise yöu!
But no problem, I have a plan B!
How do I look?
Long hair,
French manicure, ladies' jewelry...
Don't laugh, yöu idiot!
I'm sending yöu this video...
in these beautiful clothes...
...so that yöu miss me just
a little bit and come for my wedding!
Yeah, man!
I'm getting married! Me! Aditi!
The whole nine yards too...
Destination wedding in Udaipur...
20th to 25th December...
Can't believe it? Me either!
Look...
I know yöu're very busy...
...yöur life is amazing,
yöu're extremely cool...
...and yöu don't
like coming to India...
But... Please come?
I'm losing my mind here.
Can yöu believe it? We grew up!
Okay... love yöu. Bye.
I was so sure yöu wouldn't come...
Me too... but yöu'd never let me
live it down if I missed yöur wedding.
How are yöu?
How do I look?
What happened with the bar deal?
What always happens...
...it sank!
The investors said they
couldn't bear the loss.
All that bar needs
is a little renovation...
Anyway, never mind.
Never mind?
How much money do yöu need?
Two hundred crores! yöu have?!
Lf I did,
I'd give it to yöu in a second.
I didn't even take
money from my own father...
Now why did yöu do that?
Because he didn't give me any!
He said giving me any money is as
good as flushing it down the toilet!
Lt's 8 o'clock, Avi.
Don't drink so much...
Please!
Don't get married, Aditi! Please!
Not this nonsense again...
What do yöu see in this oaf?
Taran.
His name is Taran.
He's a bit strange.
Not at all!
Taran?
Taran!
Taran!!!
Hi Aditi... Hi!!!
yöu're looking beautiful!
What are yöu doing?!
My engagement ring fell
into the pool! I'm saving it!
Baby, just get out,
someone else will get it!
No, Aditi!
I won't let our ring drown this way!
Will he live or should
I throw him a float?
Got it!
Great! Now come on out!
Avi!
Aditi... Avi's here!!!
So happy yöu came!
Baby, come on!
We're going to be late!
Didn't I tell yöu Avi
would definitely come?
May yöu have many fat children!
And now to tell yöu about Aditi...
Aditi's best friend...
Naina! Over to yöu, Naina.
So one day, Aditi randomly said...
I'm going to meet a boy.
I was like... arranged marriage? yöu?
"I'm bored!" she said.
He's an engineer or something...
Maybe he'll be entertaining?!
Barely a month later,
Aditi called again...
"I'm getting married."
To who?!
That same boy... The engineer.
yöu know... a few years ago,
Aditi and I went on a trek together.
I didn't think we'd keep
in touch when we returned.
Then, one night my phone rang.
"Open the door"
...and there she was...
Aditi.
Beer in hand and
cigarettes in her pocket.
She listened to rock music. I
put on my earplugs and went to sleep.
And that's when I realized...
we were friends.
I've seen it all. Stubborn Aditi...
Mad Aditi...
Her... leather jacket phase...
Her..."I AM a painter" phase...
But... I AM an artist!
Hair colours phase...
Pink, purple, yellow...
But as wild and insane
as Aditi can be...
...she's also a beautiful,
trustworthy friend.
I love yöu, Aditi.
I'm going to miss yöu.
They say...
there is no right time to get married.
yöu're in trouble from
the moment it happens.
Aditi, my tiger, my wild child...
I left yöu alone for a few years...
And look at the mess yöu've made!
Madness is an illness...
An illness that old
age makes yöu forget...
But screw that...
we won't be old for a while...
So let's be MAD tonight!!!
BUNNY!!!
Look what I found!
Hi Avi...
I told yöu! He'll die of shock!
Did yöu'll really think
I'd miss Aditi's suicide mission?
I was convinced of it.
What a surprise man!
What a surprise! Let's have a drink?
Sure.
Why weren't yöu at the cocktail bro?
Her lover ruined my one and only suit.
Who is this specimen, Aditi?
He's loaded. Looks like a weirdo,
but he drives a BMW.
Just shut up, Avi.
Taran is really sweet
and intelligent, Bunny...
He really loves me.
He's basically a lap dog.
How's the restaurant, bro?
Fantastic!
So, Bunny...
how long are yöu here for?
I'm leaving on the
night of yöur wedding.
Going straight to Paris.
Paris! Oo lala!
Lt's an amazing project...
yöur life's always
been amazing, Bunny.
yöu're not in Chicago anymore?
Chicago was a long time ago!
Since then New York, Hawaii, back to...
Dude yöu move around so much,
it's hard to keep track.
yöu were in Boston
when we spoke last, right?
No.
L.A.
Oh, right.
When uncle... How could I forget...
I'm really sorry, Bunny.
He passed away so suddenly...
It was really sad...
I'm going to go shower.
Will yöu be going home?
Not on this trip.
Come on guys...
Let's DO something tonight!
The three of us together again...
Just like old times!
What old times, Aditi?
Everything's changed now.
yöu used to say that things
don't change between friends, Avi.
True.
But yöu and I...
...we're not friends anymore, Bunny.
Cheers, man.
Oh man, it's cold!
Lt's just water...
It'll feel okay in a while.
yöu'll be fine...
Are yöu married?
What?!
No...
Kids?
Ya! Three!
Vile woman!
Why are yöu asking?
I'm wondering if I should
behave or flirt openly.
Is flirting necessary?
Of course!
Lt's very good for health!
yöu know like...
YOGA!
I remember...
Were yöu always this beautiful
or is this the magic of time?
What a cheesy line...
yöu find this cheesy now,
baby doll, but there was time...
...that yöu were
floored by these lines!
Me?! Floored by yöu? Please!
yöu haven't changed at all, Bunny.
Except for one thing...
What?
The old Bunny used
to smile a lot more...
Does the water feel okay now?
Lt's nice.
What did I tell yöu?
Give it some time...
everything will be okay...
Goodnight.
I think that's enough lime!
Call Mr. Sharma from my phone
and pick him up from the Reception!
He's waiting for yöu there!
Naina! Phone?!
Welcome. - Congratulations.
Hey, yöung man! - Hello, uncle.
Does he think I'm his slave?!
Woohoo!
Yeah! What a great hand! Cheers.
Come on, just one more game.
Everytime I see this girl...
I'm telling yöu.
Idiot.
Come on. Feed me!
Like a blushing rose... - What?
Like a poet's dream...
Like the morning...
Like the morning... - Light? - Light!
Bunny... my phone?!
BUNNY!
BUNNY!
So... yöu're having an affair!
Of course not ya!
Then he's hitting on yöu?
I don't know man!
Come on, Naina!
Shut up, Bunny!
Who is this dude?
What is it to yöu?!
Sneaking around taking
pictures of yöu...
Must be around here somewhere!
How could yöu read
my messages, Bunny!
I didn't just read them, Naina!
I've messaged yöur Romeo
to meet yöu by the lake!
WHAT?!
Bunny!
Is it still PG 13
or is it Triple X yet?!
Why are yöu hiding him?!
Is he that ugly?
Bunny!
Bunny!
Tired, Bunny?
As if... I don't get tired...
Naina, yöu were where?
I was looking for
yöu like everywhere!
Hi...
Naina's also been looking
for yöu like everywhere, Dave...
Sorry, what?
Nothing... Have fun, kids!
Naina, Mrs.
Goswami's earrings are lost...
Dave, yöu...
Give me my phone!
Comment ça va au jour d'huit,
mademoiselle?
That's French for "how are yöu today?"
Don't yöu look fresh..."Neyna"!
Stop wasting time, Bunny!
I have a big problem to solve...
...actually, yöu do!
Jump onto that ledge.
I'm not a circus animal!
Are yöu scared, Bunny?
Now don't hurt my ego.
God save me! - Shhh!!! Now listen...
Quietly look into that room...
and tell me what's happening!
Since when are yöu so vulgar?
Oh it's Aditi's wife! Taran!
What is he doing?
I'm not sure...
Some kind of tribal dance...
But what am I doing here?!
yöu're checking how
good their dance is!
Whose?!
The groom's side! Duffer!
Ohhh!!!
yöu should always gauge
yöur enemy's strengths!
Yo... Rambo from First Blood!
This is a wedding,
not Dancing with the Stars!
And, anyway, I don't cheat!
Liar! yöu'd still be in
pre-school if yöu didn't cheat!
Point.
Ohohohoho!
Are they amazing?
Hold on... Naina!
What? What happened?!
There's a girl also...
His cousin from London...
...supposed to be a deadly dancer!
Holy mother of Lara!
Bunny! Bunny!
What is happening?!
yöu wanted a big,
fat Indian wedding, no?
Suffer now!
Bunny. Not now.
MY BLOUSE!
Aye! This is my TV show!
118 islands, can yöu believe that?
Venice is made of-
What's Venice like?
Fail. It's the sewage
system of Europe.
Really? I'm going
there for my honeymoon!
Why?
Taran loves these old,
historical places.
It's okay, man. It'll be fun.
Nonsense!
yöu're going to be bored to tears.
Shut up, Avi.
yöu still have two days left...
just run away!
Why did yöu change the channel?
That was my TV show...
Sorry.
Didn't know that.
Avi. Change it back.
It's yöur show, man.
How many times are
yöu going to watch it?
I want yöu to see it.
Not interested.
What's yöur problem?
What's yöur problem, Avi?
yöu know what my problem is.
I want to hear it from yöu.
Drop the act, Bunny.
This is the first time
in 8 years yöu've come to see us.
yöu've called, what, 10-20 times?
And yöu're asking
me what my problem is?
Lt's not like yöu were
calling every day.
I did, man. I called a lot!
But I got sick of listening
to yöur answering machine!
yöu forgot about us, Bunny.
Try to understand, man!
I was really caught up!
New places, new cities...
I had to make my life... my career!
I had to fulfill my dreams!
yöur dreams!
yöur life!
yöur problems...
...yöur excuses!
Everything is about yöu!
What about me, Bunny?
How much do yöu even know about me?
My life, my dreams...
my circumstances!
Avi, man, chill!
Look at Aditi...
It's not like we spoke every day,
but she's not so sore with me!
That's because Aditi doesn't
expect anything from yöu!
She didn't even think
yöu'd come for her wedding!
And who can blame her?!
yöu didn't even come back
for yöur own father's funeral!
Listen.
Aditi's right.
Don't expect anything from me.
This is how I am.
How?
Selfish?
Shameless?
Halfway around the world, Bunny
and yöu've completely lost yöur mind!
At least I'm not like yöu!
A drunkard, a gambler... a failure!
Are yöu trying to kill me?!
Are yöu crazy or what?!
Here... use this pillow.
yöu cheat!
Come on and fight like a man!
Aditi... yöu look so pretty!
I'm getting married, guys!
And my two best friends
are fighting like dogs!
Stop this drama and apologize
to each other right now.
Sorry.
It's okay.
He's not saying sorry!
Bunny.
Sorry.
Beavis...
Butthead...
Hug each other.
Come on!
One minute... my turn!
Drink a little.
Yo aunty! Have this. - I don't drink.
How many times will yöu lie in front
of the same man? Take this.
Sunny?!
Just what I needed...
All the best... yöu.
"yöu!"
Total manufacturing defect.
What are yöu just standing here for?
Let me focus.
Glass?
Are yöu ready, guys?
Open... open... open position.
Smile... smile! Interact...
Look into the eyes
of the audience directly...
Bro!
Hey!
All good?
Hi hi hi... I,
uh, I just hope Aditi likes my dance.
Everything will be okay, right?
yöu don't have AIDS.
Funny! Funny...
Bunny, thanks...
Thanks for coming
to our wedding, man...
yöu know,
it really means a lot... to me...
...to Aditi... to our family...
Here.
No, I just...
Take it. This makes everything better.
Come on... drink!
Now... for the groom!
And the very hot,
the very sexy...
Laraaaa!
Taran?!
What happened to him?
Well done, my cheetah!
Oh my God...
that was like totally incredible!
That was surprising!
yöu said that their
dance was rubbish!
Yeah, man. It was!
No no no no... That wasn't rubbish...
That was mind-blowing!
I know! Genius!
Now who's going to
see my traditional dance?
All the uncles!
I really wanted to be the best,
yöu know.
yöu want to give an explosive
performance, right? Leave it to me.
yöu? What are yöu going to do?
Aye. yöu don't know
how much talent I have!
Just hold on to yöur skirt...
It shouldn't fly
it off in excitement!
Come on.
Let's set this stage on fire!
And now...
Everyone's favourite...
the gorgeous...
Naina?
Okay, bye.
Naina?
Get up, sleepy head.
We only have today to see Udaipur.
Come on, hurry up.
So that's what yöur life is like!
yöu must have seen
so many amazing things.
yöu can't even imagine.
I love my life, Naina.
I could never live like yöu people.
Come.
Like "us people"?
I mean...
yöu'll spend yöur whole life in
one city, in one house, in one room...
Doesn't that scare yöu?
Not at all.
This is the life I've chosen.
I have no interest in living
like yöu... Like a hippie!
yöu're only saying all this...
because yöu've seen
nothing of the world, baby!
What do yöu know of the high
of living in different countries?
And what do yöu know
of the comfort of home?
yöu don't know what it's
like to sit with a strange family...
...and listen to their life stories.
And yöu don't know what it's
like to sit with old friends...
...and reminisce.
Someday I'll take
yöu to San Francisco...
...to eat their famous mutton burgers.
yöu'll go crazy.
Someday I'll feed yöu
mutton biryani from home.
yöu'll forget yöur burger.
yöu haven't been to Paris, Naina.
Have yöu ever seen a child being born?
No...
...but I have lots of
children running around in Paris.
So cheap ya.
Johannesburg.
World Cup.
Andres Iniesta's winning goal.
Wankhede Stadium.
Mahendra Singh Dhoni's winning sixer!
California's sunshine.
Bombay's rains.
Blueberry cheesecake.
Indian custard.
Phantom of the Opera on Broadway.
Dilwaale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge in
a single screen theatre. With popcorn.
Actually... ya man.
One day yöu'll be the
fat mother of two children.
And I'll still be hot and fit.
Not two... six!
And when I'm sitting with
them watching Harry Potter part...
...20 in my mansion,
yöu'll be stitching yöur
own shoes in some African village.
yöu're not right, Naina...
yöu're just very different from me.
I know that.
Oye! Do yöu really want 6 kids?
Name a couple of them Bunny...
Please.
And are they all going be from
the same father or should I help?
Disgusting!
Just think!
How handsome our kids would be!
With my good looks and well...
my brains.
yöu're such a dog!
What?
Have yöu checked in?
Okay take care of yöurself.
Okay bye.
Come now, quickly.
We don't want to miss
that Light and Sound show.
I'm tired, Bunny...
...and it's so nice here!
Yes, but when we've seen everything...
It'll be even nicer!
yöu can't do everything in one day!
Of course I can.
Look at this...
...we only have this much left!
And now we don't.
Sit down quietly.
What if we find out later...
that the Light and Sound
show was mind-blowing?
Of course it will be mind-blowing...
But if we leave,
we'll miss this amazing sunset.
How ever hard yöu try, Bunny...
...yöu'll always miss
out on something in life.
Let's just... enjoy the moment.
Three years ago, I was working
for a company called Trek America.
I was on a trek with
24 college students...
I returned to the
city after eight days.
That's when my Bombay phone came on.
I had 155 voice messages.
My family...
Avi... Aditi...
My father had passed away.
He passed away on Monday...
I found out on Saturday...
His last rites had
already been performed.
We hadn't spoken in over a month...
I hadn't seen him in three years.
He used to say that
I should visit more often...
I should have listened to him.
2,000 seen.
2,000 blind.
4,000 seen.
Pack.
10,000 seen.
10,000 show.
Don't get into this, man.
Just play.
Good hand.
Thank yöu, everyone!
See yöu later.
What?
How is this my fault?!
Do yöu have socks?
This isn't Las Vegas, man!
yöu weren't going
to hit a double jackpot.
I was doing my thing, man.
It's okay, man. It's done now.
Why don't yöu ever listen, Bunny!
Don't waste yöur hard earned money.
Money is nothing.
Not everyone has this
is nothing in their destiny.
Here.
Double jackpot?
Las Vegas?
The casino episode...
...where she put 20 dollars
in the slot machine and...
...won 20,000.
That host of yöurs is hot!
yöu've seen my show, Avi?
yöu'll have done what... 40 episodes?
I've seen all.
Then why were yöu pretending?
Lt's yöur show, Bunny.
How could I not see it?
Avi, can I say something?
I heard about yöur bar.
It's just a bad phase, man.
I have some money saved up.
I want yöu to take it...
...and save yöur bar.
It's a lot of money, Bunny.
How much?
Twenty five lakh.
Done.
yöu ass... yöu think
yöu can buy me with yöur dollars?
My friendship is not so cheap.
I don't want yöur money, Bunny.
Understand?
Then what can I do for yöu, Avi?
Here.
Have a drink with me.
Why are yöu marrying this guy?
I saw how jealous he got
when yöu went there to talk to Avi.
yöu're sure about this, right?
Bunny, I wasn't going to talk to Avi.
I went there to give him a slap.
He's spent 2 lakhs in 2 days.
1 lakh on booze and 1 lakh in poker...
Taran's just gone and paid it off.
He wasn't being jealous, he was
just stopping me from insulting Avi.
So... yöu're not in
love with Avi anymore?
yöu knew?
Everybody knew.
Except for that duffer Avi.
Yeah, man. I was.
But, yöu know,
Avi was never in that relationship.
It was just me... alone.
But with Taran...
How do I explain it...
yöu know, it's like...
Before I met him, I was fine...
but now I know that...
I can be happy, too.
It's simple.
With certain people...
...things just seem better
by spending time with them.
yöur... cap.
Thank yöu...
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry too!
But yöu shouldn't
shout at me like that!
I'm not shouting! I didn't shout!
yöu called me a bitch...
- I didn't say bitch!
Yes, yöu did... - yöu did!
No no... - Yes yöu did!
Bunny!
Bunny!
yöu guys carry on...
I'll be right back.
The magic of this
night is intoxicating...
Hi...
Are yöu looking for something?
Who is this?
This... uh... is Vikram.
He's come to shoot the wedding.
And to meet Naina.
Why are yöu sitting here?
Who are yöu?
Get lost.
Bunny?!
Excuse me?
I said, yöu, please...
get lost.
Bunny, stop it.
yöu are extremely rude.
Look, this is my
best friend's wedding.
yöu're not welcome here.
Looks like yöu've had
too much to drink.
Naina's invited me here.
- I'm Naina's boyfriend.
Get lost.
Guys, stop it. Stop it.
Bunny, stop it. Come on ya.
Vikram, give me five minutes...
I'll be right there, okay?
Thank yöu.
yöu... are not my boyfriend.
So is he?
What's gotten into yöu, Bunny?!
Go and apologise to him.
I'd rather break his face.
yöu've lost yöur mind, Bunny.
Everytime I see this girl, huh?
What?
Is this the guy who
sent yöu that cheap message?
Not that loser, Dave?
Yes, Bunny.
Vikram sent me those messages.
Do yöu love him?
Do yöu love him?!
How does it matter?
Lt matters!
I thought yöu only drank with me!
What are yöu trying to say, Bunny?
yöu should send this Vikram away!
Why?!
Because I want yöu to
spend all yöur time with me.
Bunny.
I was only here with Vikram because I
cannot spend another second with yöu!
He's just my friend...
So then... he's not yöur boyfriend?
No, Bunny, he's not!
Please stop this drama!
Why don't yöu understand that
if I stand here any longer then...
Then what, Naina?
Then I'll fall in love with yöu...
Again.
And yöu won't...
Again.
Vikram... left.
I love yöu.
Really?
I love yöu.
I love yöu too.
The thing is that...
I love yöu is just a beginning...
Then what happens, Bunny?
What happens, Naina?
Then those two people cannot
handle those three words...
Let's not talk about this.
Bunny, please let me go...
No.
Please...
No.
Bunny, I'm a simple girl.
I want to live a simple life...
yöu're not wrong...
yöu're just very different from me.
Please let me go.
I can't.
Then don't go to Paris!
Don't take this job that yöu've
been dreaming of yöur whole life...
Don't travel...
Because I can't go with yöu...
Mom, dad, clinic...
Everything is here.
How can I leave?
Okay...
yöu come visit me twice a year.
And no funny business in Paris...
After a few years,
yöu move back here...
Naina, I...
I know!
I understand yöu, Bunny.
I know what yöur dreams are...
What yöu want from life...
And that's why...
...we should forget each other.
Bye.
Don't go, Naina.
This... feels nice.
That's why I have to go.
Five minutes...
Bunny... - Please... five seconds...
Dad...
We should leave.
I know...
Here, take this...
Dad, yöu've given me enough dollars...
yöu keep this. It'll help.
Don't argue with yöur father.
Keep it safely now.
Were yöu crying?
Well, I'm finally getting rid of yöu!
I'll miss yöu.
This house is going
to feel empty without yöu...
Anyway, we have to go. Come on.
Aren't yöu happy, Dad?
Of course I'm happy!
But I'm also a little selfish...
I don't want to lose yöu.
What are yöu trying to say, Dad?
yöu don't want me to go to America?
How does it matter what I want?
Do yöu ever listen to anything I say?
Of course it matters.
If yöu didn't want me to go,
yöu should have said it before...
yöu can still say it.
Then don't go.
Okay.
Would yöu really do that...
for me?
Yes.
For yöu to say that... is enough.
Now listen.
Go wherever yöu want to go.
Do whatever yöu want to do.
Live life any way yöu want to.
Remember one thing, son...
Whatever happens in life...
I'll always be with yöu.
I'm tired... of running.
I never respected time...
...and now, Dad's gone.
If only I could tell
him how much I love him...
Bunny, do yöu know what
gave yöur father most happiness?
Not me, not yöur mother,
not his work...
yöu did.
Do yöu know why?
Because yöu never
gave up on yöur dreams...
yöu lived life on yöur own terms.
He understood how difficult it is
to carve yöur own path through life.
And he was proud that yöu
had the courage to walk that path.
If yöu want to tell yöur
father how much yöu love him,
yöu need to do what
yöu've always done.
Live yöur dreams.
Listen to yöur heart.
Thank yöu.
Everything will be okay, Bunny.
Except for this sherbet.
It's still terrible.
This is my first honeymoon, baby...
Shut up!
I want to spend New Year's
day with yöu amongst the stars...
Stupid!
The year comes to a close tonight...
And this bar does too.
To the new year and
to new beginnings!
Cheers!
Hi.
Here.
What are yöu doing here?
I've come to spend
New Year's Eve with yöu!
Paris?
Cancel.
Why?
I didn't want to risk it.
What if someone else
whisked yöu away?!
Seriously? yöu're not going?
I refused their offer...
...So I could take yöu up on yöurs!
Should we make this
lighting a little romantic?
Are yöu afraid of the dark?
I love yöu.
Come on.
On that note, let's have some cake.
This job was everything to yöu.
It was.
But there's a right
time for everything!
And today...
...is the right time for this.
Naina!
Will yöu marry me?
yöu've lost yöur mind.
This is fake.
But my love is real, baby!
Sorry, dude...
I didn't have a lot of time.
Naina!
Bunny yöu... yöu'll run away?!
So yöu bring me back!
That means yöu'll really run away?
I won't go anywhere! Try it and see?
Try?!
Marriage isn't about trying!
Once yöu're in it...
...it's boiled food for fifty years
'til yöu die! Can yöu handle it?
Are yöu trying to scare me?
Scared already?
This is not yöur cup of tea.
Fine then. I'm going.
Bunny!
Will yöu marry me or not?
Why do yöu want to marry me?
Because I can't escape yöu!
yöu've screwed me!
I still want the same things
but now I want them with yöu!
I still want to see every corner of
the world but with yöur hand in mine!
Look, Naina.
Time waits for no one.
It flies past us
and we get left behind.
And before I get left too far behind,
I want to spend some time with yöu.
yöu make me happy Naina.
In my mind, we're already married...
Now come on, yöu marry me too!
Such a long speech...
The least yöu can do is clap!
Naina, say something-
Ahhh!
What happened?
Baby, give me yöur phone.
My battery's dead.
Hi this is Aditi, I'm not available
right now...
Hello?
Aye, loser! Are yöu wasted yet?
Bunny! yöu dog! Where are yöu?!
yöu'll never believe it...
Hi!!!
Hey!
Where are yöu? - It's a long story...
Hey, who are yöu with?
I'll tell yöu...
Who's the chick with yöu?
yöu know... our Scholar...
Bunny?
Adi?!
Bunny?!
Aditi?
Avi! Hang on!
Let me put yöu on speaker!
Avi, talk to Adi!
Aditi?!
Avi?!
Aditiiiii!
Dude, I've been trying
yöur number forever!
Where are yöu?!
I have no idea what's going on!
I'm at the bar!
I have no idea either!
Shhhh... guys!
Naina oh Nainaaaaa!
Oh my God! Okay.
Bunny. Where are the two of yöu?
My house...
That means yöu didn't leave?
Oh my God!
I knew it!!! I knew the
two of yöu were having a scene!
Liars! Idiots! I'm going
to kill yöu when I get back!
Either I'm totally wasted
or yöu've all lost yöur minds!
I'll explain,
I'll explain everything...
But there's only 5 seconds
left for New Year's! So... 5!
4!
3!
2!
ONE! Happy New Year!
I love yöu, Aditi!
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year guys!
- New Year guys!
Happy New Year, guys!
Let's all have a great year ya!
