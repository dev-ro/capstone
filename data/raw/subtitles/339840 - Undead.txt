Yes, yes, yes,
we take care of things here.
WeII.
WeII, weII, weII...
your famiIy has Ieft you with
a bit of a burden, haven't they?
A property, Ieft to you.
You haven't got any brothers
or sisters, have you?
No, onIy chiId, very Iucky.
Let me teII you something,
Iife is fuII of responsibiIities...
Miss ChapIin.
When you inherited your
parents' property, their farm...
you inherited their responsibiIities,
their debts, your debts!
Mate, that chick is a doII.
You know, she is Iike
untouched country.
No, mate, Aggie is the boss here,
but she is on another caII.
I can't stop apoIogizing
enough, I reaIIy can't.
Let me put you on to her nephew,
he's the other boss.
Phone.
Aggie WhippIe's Charters,
Wayne WhippIe speaking.
Yeah, mate.
We can fIy you out there, it 's
dry this time of the year though.
I know the Iake you're taIking
about. What 's wrong with it?
A Ioony Marion guy
reckons he was abducted.
No, that was months ago.
No, mate, I can assure you
there's no aIiens up there.
No worries, whenever you want
to go, you pay me and I fIy you.
No worries, mate. AIright buddy,
I'II taIk to you on Wednesday.
Dickhead, don't be drawing
on my girI, aIright?
We here at the firm we take no
pIeasure in performing these tasks.
But you knew, you knew!
You knew of our strict poIicy
on faiIure of payment!
You faiIed us.
-Thanks.
-I'm sorry, is there anything...?
-He's the biggest arsehoIe ever.
-Excuse me?
Don't think because it 's your first
day, he's going to go easy on you.
I wouId rather go back
to working in a bake shop...
than be that thing's partner.
Come on, ConstabIe, Iet 's go!
We haven't got aII fuckin' day!
There's a prang out on South Road,
you can do your fuckin' naiIs Iater!
Good Iuck.
Hi, Gran, it 's me.
René, your granddaughter.
I'II be in the city tomorrow, okay?
AII right?
I need to come and stay
with you for a whiIe.
No, I can't stay here.
The farm is gone, Gran.
I know Mum and Dad Ioved the pIace.
So did I.
Anyway, I'm getting a ride.
No, he's from the city.
Yeah, that agent guy.
Here she comes. I gotta go, mate.
I'II catch you Iater.
René!
AII the way, René, aII the way.
Get it aII sorted out?
OK, Iet 's hit the road.
-Come on!
-Come on, kid!
Come on, kid, you nearIy
got through me the Iast time.
By the way, Ruthie...
teII George EarI is taking
the boat out on Sunday.
-That 's great.
-They might have a nice day.
-I'II teII him.
-Thank you. Bye bye. See you Iater.
We stay here or
we head up to OneaweIIy's Dam.
-It 'II be just Iike Iast year, mate.
-Mate.
I can't go up to SiIverwood.
Ronnie is at SiIverwood.
Ronnie is at SiIverwood. Ronnie,
who didn't have the decency...
to return to me my prized mower.
You prick!
-Let 's go and see him.
-No, mate, no.
You wanted the mower then?
Are you aII right?
Bugger me!
You caII this a shortcut?
Stay here.
Can anyone hear me?
Don't you know how to drive,
you wankers?
You drive too cIose together...
you shouId aIways have
two car Iengths ahead of you.
Just some chick, mate,
she is reaIIy messed up.
I did what I couId.
Is there some other road
we can take?
-Shit!
-What?
We shouId have gone right back
to the Warren Ridge turn.
No, you shouId
have fIown us out, Wayne.
Not with those bIoody rocks
faIIing from the sky, Honey.
Everyone's Ieaving town
on Warren Ridge Road.
With aII the traffic and congestion,
beIieve me, this way's faster.
Can I use your phone?
Those things you saw out there,
that 's onIy the beginning.
What?
The beginning of the end.
The end of what?
The worId, the universe, everything.
God, I hope no one is hurt.
But someone may be hurt.
-I don't see anyone.
-We have to see if anyone's hurt!
Stay in the car.
Be carefuI.
It 's okay, Iove, don't move,
we'II get you heIp, aIright?
What the heII are you doing?
SaIIy? Shit! Shit!
It doesn't work.
Dry your hair.
My name is René.
Miss Catch of the Day.
I know who you are.
I've seen you around town, you know.
Let me in, Iet me in!
PIease Iet me in!
HeIp me!
Open the door!
Let me in!
About time!
This mad thing, it kiIIed Aggie,
punched a hoIe through her head.
Are you sure she is dead?
Mate, it punched a hoIe through
her head, what does that teII you?
-Yeah, but is she dead?
-What? Are you fuckin' nuts?
It was eating her brain.
-It 's that Ioon Marion, isn't it?
-Yes. Do you have a car?
It 's stopped up on the road. Aggie has
the keys, but she doesn't have a brain!
PoIice, open the door!
ConstabIe, get out of the way!
Move your fuck arse now.
What are you? Dumb and stupid?
She said open the fuckin' door!
Dickhead!
When I was a kid, we respected our
parents, we didn't fuckin' eat 'em!
Sir!
It 's aII that crack marijuana, fuckin'
hippie, surfie, doIe bIudging pricks!
Sir?
Marion? Marion...
you keep those fuckin' guns
pointed at me, paI...
and I'II finish you off faster than
a birthday cake in a fat chicks' party!
Drop the guns now, sonny.
Fucking now!
KiII them!
Hon, come on!
Come on! Come on!
Fuck me!
Downstairs, go.
Come on!
Hurry up you bastards, move,
they're right fuckin' behind us!
Move you fuckin' poofters, move it!
Shut the door, you hairy prick!
Shut it, you wanker!
Shut it!
Jesus Christ!
Fuck!
What the heII were those things?
How can they get back up again?
What is this pIace?
-The onIy safe pIace.
-It 's Iike a morgue in here!
The onIy safe pIace? Can I have
a cup of tea with this fruit cake?
-Everyone try and stay caIm!
-Can anyone teII me?
We're aII going to die.
-We're stuck in this tin can now.
-No one is going to die.
AIright, fuck it,
just fucking Iisten up!
No one is going to die, not today.
Not on my fuckin' watch!
What about aII those dead
pricks dying outside?
Hey, don't you fuckin' mess
with me boy, fuckin' wanker!
ConstabIe, what 's this Dickhead
got your fuckin' weapon for?
Marion!
-StiII got a Iicense, big boy?
-It 's upstairs, want to get it?
MoIIy, you teII this boy
what 's gonna be.
WeII...
We haven't got aII fuckin' day!
WeII, untiI you provide us with a
Iicense for a category H weapon...
a firearm, incIuding an air pistoI
and a bIank-fire firearm...
under 75 cm in Iength and
a registered gun cIub membership...
that compIies with the amended
Weapons Act reguIations of 1997...
and is signed by a member of the
body of the certifying cIub...
I wiII have to confiscate
the guns from you.
Give me a fuckin' reason.
I'm fuckin' beggin' you. Boy!
Good boy. Good boy.
Good boy.
AIright, I'm the Iaw here, so
you fuckin' Iisten to what I say...
when I say it and
we get through this OK.
We got heIp on the way,
we got heIp on the way!
So you Iisten to what I say,
when I fuckin' say it...
and we'II aII be eating Mrs. WeIman's
BBQ snags by tomorrow morning.
Mrs. WeIman was eaten out
on the road haIf an hour ago.
You keep fuckin' messing
with me, boy...
and I'II straighten you out faster
than a poofter in a fuckin' rodeo.
Prick!
The phone doesn't work.
Give it to me!
Come in, Base.
-Base, pIease come in
-It doesn't work!
-Tracy, do you hear me?
-It doesn't work!
-Shut up! Don't go...
-It was the storm...
...stopped it aII. MobiIes too.
-ConstabIe, caIm down.
-Where are the rest of the poIice?
-They're on patroI.
They're aII dead, eaten aIive.
-I've never seen anything Iike this.
-I have.
-What the heII is happening here?
-It 's an invasion.
You have to be fuckin' kiddin' me.
The end of Iife as we know it.
We are the chosen ones.
The ones who wiII stand and fight.
It 's getting better,
you've got shits for brains.
-You're a fuckin' Ioonie!
-You have aII been sent to me...
...for a reason.
-WiII you just shut your fuckin' mouth?
You dead shit fuckin' monkey
bag fucker!
These things are brain
eating zombies.
There's no such things as zombies.
So how does it feeI, René?
How does it feeI to be trapped
in this town with the rest of us?
Just Ieave me aIone.
You don't even Iook at me
when I speak to you.
That titIe was mine again. I won
that competition fair and square.
Roping two pigs together isn't a taIent
fit for winning Miss Catch of the Day.
No bIoody way!
She Iooked aIright, though,
in that outfit she was wearing.
Maybe I don't Iook as good
as you in a bikini right now...
with Wayne Junior on the way, but...
but I've got a singing voice Iike an
angeI and if you hadn't cheated...
Come on, SaIIyanne, I was broke!
That was the onIy reason I entered.
...and forget aII about
your duties as queen.
You are to preserve the best interest
of the town. That 's your No 1 priority.
Ladies, you need to shut up
with the girIie taIk and caIm down.
-The situation is under controI.
-HeIp wiII be here soon.
If you feeI scared,
just think of a happy pIace.
Your foIks' farm aIways
seemed to make you happy.
-I'm having a turd of a day.
-Remember when we were kids...
your dad used to swing us on that
tyre he hung from that tree?
We were happy then,
there was room to swing...
but you couIdn't swing
a cat in here!
Thanks, MoIIy.
I don't get this,
how do they know where we were?
-They can smeII us.
-Great!
-They want to feed off us.
-We're Iike spam in a fuckin' can...
-Good job!
-Are we safe in here?
No food, too many peopIe.
-And water, where's your taps?
-No taps down here.
The bottIed water is upstairs.
You don't want to drink
the tap water.
Why?
Tap water is tank water...
tank water is rain water,
the rain is aII part of this attack.
What?
And there was this Iight
coming down from the cIouds...
and it was sucking up
bugs and stuff.
WeII that expIains it, a Iight coming
down sucking up bugs. BuIIshit!
WeII, peopIe haIIucinate some times
when they panic, I know I do.
It 's probabIy just the sunIight
coming through the cIouds.
That 's what it was.
-That was no sunIight.
-And the meteorites faIIing? I saw that.
The whoIe town saw that.
WeII, I am no weather girI...
but I am sure this kind of thing
happens aII the time.
You're a fisherman.
We used to seII these in my store.
Damn things soId better
than the guns ever did.
It brings me good Iuck.
And you caII this good Iuck?
I'm stiII breathing.
-She's one of them!
-No, she's having a baby!
-What baby?
-Get me to the hospitaI.
-We have to Ieave.
-No one Ieaves untiI I say so.
-We have to get her out of here.
-We've got two cops here.
-They know how to deIiver a baby.
-That 's right, we do.
-There you go.
-I'm sure you do, MoIIy.
See if the cervix is diIated and,
Sergeant, you mop up her water.
We're out of here!
MoIIy, get her ready now, do it now!
AIright, we're Ieaving, Iet 's go.
-We must prepare.
-They're Ieaving.
-They'II die, we must stick together.
-We have to take her to the hospitaI.
That 's a girI.
I'm staying here.
-We're Ieaving.
-Come, sIowIy.
Come on!
Come on!
We gotta get her going!
God! Let 's get out of here!
You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me,
paI! Put it down!
Put the bag down,
get your hands away!
Get your hands away.
Get up, up, up!
-Where is the car?
-Garage.
-How do we get there?
-Through the kitchen.
-Where are the car keys?
-In the haIIway.
-Can we get to them easiIy?
-Depends on what 's stiII up there.
Remember, I'm in charge.
You go first, big guy.
Empty.
They're aII gone.
Bingo!
The contractions have stopped.
Fuck a dead duck,
you IittIe fuckin'... fuck!
These crazy fuckin' pimpIy faced
fuckin' gang banger!
fuckin' come into your fuckin'
house, fuckin' unin-fuckin'-vited!
Come on!
What 's wrong with fuckin' youth
feIIowship? What 's wrong with it?
Fuck ya, fuckin' fuckin', fucker!
AII the way, René.
Fuckin' heII,
you fuckin' piece of shit!
Fuck!
Die, you fuckin' headIess fuckin'
mother fuckin' piece of shit!
Take the fuckin' guns, ConstabIe!
See you on the other side, sunshine.
Upstairs to the bathroom now!
Get fucked, prick,
we're heading to the car!
Crap, everyone upstairs now!
FoIIow me! FoIIow me!
Backing up! Backing up!
Fuck!
There's so many of them.
These things won't die.
I've never seen anything Iike it.
Shoot 'em in the brain.
They won't get back up again.
Garage is down there.
We're stiII the Iaw here. Nobody goes
down untiI I've checked it out.
On your bike, ConstabIe.
Go on, get down.
What is it, ConstabIe?
What is it, ConstabIe?
It 's cIear!
Come on down.
Are you okay?
Are you sure?
Shift your arse, paI,
I'm driving this shitbox.
Nobody is driving
this shitbox but me.
-Take me to Boongabby HospitaI.
-It 's too far.
I don't want to go back into town.
Hurry up! Let 's go!
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Just get us out of here!
We're nearIy out of BerkeIey now.
Shift your arse, princess.
I'm watching you.
I feeI Iike I'm going to throw up.
Me too.
My God.
This can't be reaI.
It 's metaI.
You know, I don't get this.
It takes the counciI 2 years to fix
a pothoIe in front of my pIace...
yet they can knock this up
in a coupIe of days.
This ain't no counciI job, Waynie.
Maybe those things buiIt it.
No.
What do you reckon buiIt it then?
I've never seen anything
Iike this before.
I saw a pineappIe twice the size of
a watermeIon, but nothing Iike this.
AIiens.
Here we go again with your crazy-arse
aIien story. The whoIe town...
...is sick of it!
-They're not aIiens...
they're zomies, okay?
Happy?
We shouId go back in the van.
That 's reaIIy gonna heIp, Wayne.
-WeII, what do you reckon?
-We just gotta think caImIy.
My God.
We're trapped.
We're aII gonna die!
We're aII gonna die!
Nobody is dying today,
not on my watch!
We're okay.
I'm gonna fuckin' cIimb it.
-What? You don't even know how it is.
-This is not in discussion!
No way are we going back.
Maybe there's an opening
further down.
We're aII fenced in.
Dead set?
Can I have a Iook?
Doesn't matter,
I cIimb the poofter here.
Sir, do you think that 's such a good
idea? You don't Iook reaI weII.
-Who the fuck is in charge here?
-You don't know what 's inside it.
And what about that heIp
you said was coming?
ConstabIe, coIIect aII their
weapons and hoId on to them...
tiII my return.
Good Iuck, mate.
I need you to reIinquish
your weapons.
Jesus Christ, you're taking
your sweet time, aren't you?
The Storm.
It 's gonna rain.
It 's the rain.
I've seen it.
Sergeant!
Sergeant!
It 's gonna rain.
Just get in the car.
Come, MoIIy,
we have to get in the car.
Babe, you're smoking!
Pour this on me!
Take it, take it, hon.
No, she is one of them!
We have to heIp him.
Fuck him!
He's gone, Iet 's go.
Come on!
-Are you burnt?
-No, it doesn't burn, it 's weird.
Take it.
MoIIy turned into
one of those things.
You must have seen her.
Who the heII is that?
It 's another one of those zombies.
Let 's get out of here.
Come on, Iet 's go!
I wanna go!
Hey, Nutbag, drive.
I can't take this anymore,
it 's just one monster after another.
AIiens, we must fight them.
Like heII we must!
Keep driving.
I just want to go home.
I'm having a baby.
MoIIy turned into
one of those things.
-What are you taIking about?
-She was normaI when I saw her.
Look, I know what I saw.
Fine, MoIIy turned into
a fIying zombie, wonderfuI!
More importantIy, what the heII
was that thing back there?
You reckon it was one of those
AIiens you have been taIking about?
-Can't remember what they Iook Iike.
-We're gonna die.
WeII, think, it couId have been
any poor bastard back there.
I just want my Mum.
-There's gotta to be another way out.
-Damn, skippy, we're fIying out.
What makes you think
things are better over that waII?
-It couIdn't be any worse.
-Listen to him...
if we go over the waII,
we shouId go prepared.
-What do you suggest?
-WeII, we need suppIies and stuff...
...we shouId stop in town first.
-We shouId go straight to the airfieId...
because those things
couId be everywhere.
No, no. Honey, she is right,
we shouId go back into town.
-This is crazy.
-AII right.
AIright, take us into town.
Maybe they aII got out in time.
No, we Ieft town
Iong before anyone eIse.
Right, get out.
Just stay there.
Can you see anyone?
-You want to get out of here, right?
-Of course.
Watch him, make sure
he doesn't do anything stupid.
And we'II go in there.
Babe, give that gun to René.
-No way, I'm not giving it to her.
-Babe...
Give that gun to René,
I give you mine.
Good girI.
AIright, stick cIose to me.
Let 's shop.
It 's warm.
Tastes Iike cameI piss.
Roping two pigs together isn't a talent
fit forwinning Miss Catch of the Day!
You know, you act crazy.
I'm just doing what I must do.
Why do you beIieve
you must do anything?
You know why.
-That AIien story of yours.
-Yes, I was attacked.
-I've heard that story before.
-No, you haven't.
I was aImost eaten
by their kiIIer fish.
It aII seems so crazy.
Giant waIIs, acid rain, zombies.
Crazy has definiteIy
come to this town for a visit.
After the fish attack
they abducted me.
I must have fought
them off somehow...
I can't remember how,
but they threw me back to earth.
Not onIy did I survive
the fish attack and the abduction...
I waIked away without a scratch.
It 's a gift, a power I have.
I must use it to fight,
but I can't do it aIone.
There is no one Ieft but us four.
Jesus Christ, Babe, couId you make
any much fuckin' noise?
The other two are heading down
the same track as the cops.
Think about what you've just seen.
I am not crazy, the strongest ones
are aIways the Iast ones Ieft.
you have the same strength I have.
I don't feeI strong,
I feeI sick again.
I think the infection
is in the air now.
MoIIy?
But time is short,
so you'd better ask yourseIf:
Are you a fighter, Fish Queen?
Or are you zombie food?
I just want things
to be back to normaI again.
-I want my farm back.
-Then take it back.
Take the whoIe town back.
AIright, Iet 's go.
Stop!
-Stop, save your buIIets.
-Mate, where did you hide those?
Go, go!
Come on, Iet 's go.
Come on!
Get in, get in!
Come on!
Come on, come on,
the Ioopy prick's gone. Get in!
Come on.
God!
It 's the rain, get your coat off.
René, come on!
-You stay here, aIright?
-No, Wayne, pIease don't go.
I'II be back, aIright?
-What are you doing?
-We need this stuff.
Here, take this.
Wayne!
Come on!
Come on!
Who are you, what 's going on?
Wayne!
Come on!
Shit!
MoIIy?
I'm over the waII!
-We have an explosion.
-Roger. Going to investigate.
Send help over here.
I've found a body.
We need assistance,
we need assistance!
Over here!
There's somebody over here!
We've found a body,
looks like a police officer.
-There's nobody else?
-We've found one victim...
looks like the pilot.
Stay behind the barricades.
If you go through the barricade,
you'll be shot.
If you go through the barricade
you will be shot!
We will open fire!
The Army is preventing anyone
from entering or leaving...
the town of Berkeley.
Those who broke through
the blockade this morning...
are now quarantined alongwith
the rest of the town's residents.
It is believed that fragments
from the Nierle comet...
created a meteor shower
overthe township.
No evidence of the alleged plague
sweeping through the town...
Has been reported since
the departure of the Alien craft.
At this point we can confirm
that Berkeley...
is the only community to be
bombarded with these fragments.
It 's a boy.
-He's fine.
-Good.
I'm sure Wayne wiII be okay.
Nurse, nurse!
I've been shot.
Someone shot me!
Someone shot me!
Someone shot me!
AII those peopIe...
they wouIdn't have died
if we didn't shoot them.
I think you are forgetting
the whoIe thing...
when they were trying to rip off
our heads and suck out our brains.
Your wounds from the fish attack
that magicaIIy heeIed...
the rain did that, didn't it?
AIiens are the saviours, not us.
One day you're out on your boat,
you get attacked by zombie fish.
They munch at your face...
Iike you are the main course
at a crazy country boy buffet.
You waIk away,
teII the town your story...
they think you're mad,
everyone thinks you're mad.
You think I'm mad.
-No, you're not mad.
-It happens again...
this time it 's not zombie fish,
it 's zombie BerkeIey.
But this time I'm prepared.
I'm ready to fight whatever
they can throw at me.
StiII, I wasn't strong enough.
The strongest ones are aIways
the Iast ones Ieft.
If that 's not me, it must be you.
I'm just a Fish Queen,
nothing more.
If that was the case, you wouIdn't
have battIed the Undead and Iived.
You wouId have been the entrée
on a smorgasboard of brain food.
Take care, Marion.
-Brings me good luck.
-You call this good luck?
The outbreak moved faster
this time.
It spread so quickly,
it couldn't be stopped.
It spread beyond Berkeley
and across the country.
Those that l could save from
the Medical Centre are here now.
Safe.
At least forthe time being.
The last couple of months
have been nothing but clear skies.
The Aliens haven't come back,
maybe some day they will.
Until then,
l must contain the infection.
Sallyanne said that my first duty
as Catch of the Day winner...
is to preserve the best interests
of the town.
