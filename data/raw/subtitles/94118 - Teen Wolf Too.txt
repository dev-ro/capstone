He honestly doesn't seem
to like you, Finstock.
He loves me. Do you know why?
He loves me, because I'm his master.
He knows I will protect him.
Like the students here
at Hamilton University. Sit!
They know why I'm here.
Finstock, do you know why you're here?
Yes, sir. 32.500 a year and summers off.
You're here because it's time to bring
the glory back to this institution.
The regional boxing finals
are in three months.
Now, you and I have a sacred oath
to provide these young people
with an opportunity
To develop not only their minds,
but their spirit as well.
Their fighting spirit. Am I right?
I promised the alumni
a winning boxing team
and all you've given me
is this Todd Howard.
All he ever did on the field
was play in the school band.
Clarinet, looks like.
Can I make a sudden move?
That's the kid. His cousin Scott played
basketball for me at Beacontown High.
- And?
- And what?
"And what? And what?" What?!
I don't think Scott knew the first thing
about playing the clarinet.
I gave that kid a full scholarship
based on your recommendation.
On my recommendation? That's great.
- Finstock!
- What?
Your job is riding on this boxing team.
And so is my reputation as an educator.
And all you brought me
is a clarinet player?
- I think it's that way.
- Ok. Three blocks?
Todd! Todd!
- Thanks a lot.
- Bye.
- Come on, Todd. Let's go.
- Excuse me.
She said the dorm was past the quad
and left after the administration building.
- Or was it right?
- We'll just keep going straight.
I know how you feel.
College is a stressful time.
Especially on your first day.
I mean, it's stressful for anyone.
Even for people without
your particular worry.
- What worry?
- You know.
I don't believe it.
Wow!
Absolutely, I mean...
I hate it when you do that.
I'm not ashamed of what I am
and you shouldn't be either.
I'm not, because it skipped my family.
No, I've got enough problems.
I'm here at a new school.
I gotta make new friends and try
to fit in without this hanging over me.
It is true that sometimes
it skips family members.
Your mother and father aren't werewolves.
But if I were you,
I'd keep my possibilities open.
Uncle Harold, can you please
change back before we get to the dorm?
Thanks.
I think the dorm is a
little north from here.
Watch out!
Phew!
Excuse me, I think that this was our space.
- Are you talking to me?
- No, but...
...I'd like to maybe give you a call.
- Gus, he says this is his space.
- A freshman.
Did you think I said that this was
my space? I didn't say that. No.
This is your space.
My space has yellow lines on it.
I brought my uncle by to see your space,
because it's so nice.
And now since you're in your space,
we'll get in ours.
- They seem like nice kids.
- I saw another space up the street.
Todd? Buddy, how are you? Come on in.
Drop your stuff off. Make yourself at home.
- Do I... know you?
- Stiles. We're roommates.
- Stiles?
- Mr. H?
- Stiles!
- Mr. H! How's the prince of paint?
- What are you doing here?
- Connections. Daughter of somebody.
Let me just tidy up a bit.
It's a great room, huh?
I decorated it myself.
Well, what do you think?
You're in the big time, kid. College.
No one telling you what to do.
No more picking up your stuff. No parents.
No offense, Mr. H. Let
me help you with that.
- Todd?
- Yeah?
- Will you walk me to the van?
- Sure.
Everything is kosher.
I've taken care of everything.
I've got Todd's year at
college all mapped out.
For the drive home.
Todd?
Thanks. You got any fries?
- See you in a bit.
- We are gonna have a great year.
- I think so.
- I've got them vibes happening.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
In a big way.
- Hey.
- Todd, I...
Listen, Uncle Harold,
everything's gonna be fine.
Once I start those science classes,
I'll really like it here.
But what about that sports scholarship?
The closest you ever came to an athletic field
was playing clarinet in the marching band.
Once they take a look at me,
they won't want me on any team.
They ain't gonna give you
something for nothing.
Well, I guess that's their problem.
- Don't forget your groceries.
- Oh yeah, thanks.
I promised your mum and dad
to look after you.
I didn't expect
to find Stiles as your roommate.
He seems Ok.
Stiles was Scott's best friend
in high school. He knows all about us.
Well, I figure since I'm not a...
Since I don't have the family problem,
there's nothing to worry about.
I'm sure you'll be Ok. Hey, listen...
- What are you doing?
- Take this. You never know.
- Well, take care.
- Yeah.
What?
- If you need anything, you call me.
- I will.
- Ok.
- Thanks, Uncle Harold. Take it easy.
Call me.
All right, all right.
I'll see you later.
En garde!
No mercy!
Ha, ha, ha!
Hey! Take it easy.
Die!
- He's nuts!
- Sorry.
Chocolate milk.
Grab the door for me?
- Todd, Chubby. Chub, Todd.
- Hi.
Chub played basketball
at Beacontown, Todd.
- So you know my cousin?
- Scott.
- We just love the Howard family.
- Stiles, where is all my stuff?
Some of my T-shirts are in there,
but help yourself. I don't mind.
What did you mean when you said
you've taken care of everything?
All your classes. I registered for you.
You what? I've already pre-registered.
I know. I saw what you picked.
I made the necessary changes. Trust me.
- This is all wrong. Girls' volleyball?
- Good class.
Candle making? French for chefs?
C'est très magnifique.
It's a good class. I'm taking it again.
- There's not one science class on here.
- Science?
You don't understand.
That boy's got werewolf
written all over him.
If everything goes as planned, he and
I are gonna take the school by storm.
I love college. I love it.
- I gotta get these changed.
- Don't make me laugh, kid.
Rules are rules. Policy is policy.
- This has got to be changed.
- You've got a lot of nerve.
Nobody ever changes their classes.
What do you want?
- I...
- Well? Well?
Come on, I haven't got all day.
I'd like... to change... some classes.
Have your professor sign this
and bring it back here. But not to me.
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.
It's not as tough as it looks.
- I'm looking for Professor Brooks.
- She's not in there.
I was wondering if you could tell me
where she might be?
Professor Brooks is
both omnivorous and bipedal.
She's also a homo sapiens femininus.
And a brilliant one at that.
- I'm Tanya Brooks. Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Todd... Howard.
- Howard, yes. I know all about you.
- You do?
I'm your faculty advisor.
I read your application.
Your talent for science
is very impressive.
I was surprised that you're here
on an athletic scholarship.
Surprised me too.
I have a favor to ask you.
I wanna be a veterinarian
and I need your class.
I know registration is over,
but could you see it my way?
- Yes?
- You're in my class. It's not full yet.
- As your advisor, I'll make an exception.
- Really? Thank you.
Thank you very much.
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking for lubrus protozoa. .
Let's see.
Here it is, right here.
There's nothing on this.
It sort of helps if you turn it on.
See you.
- I need to speak to a coach.
- You're Todd Howard.
- Yeah.
- We're all depending on you.
- Depending on me for what?
- Hey, you missed a spot.
I had a kid once who had
an athletic scholarship just like you.
A gifted athlete.
But he had this crazy dream
about wanting to become a chiropractor.
But he had to work all night at this diner.
Because he was supporting his sister
and she had three kids.
- And his name was Philip. No wait.
- Doesn't matter.
It sorta does. His name was George.
Her three kids were really nice,
but one had two thumbs on his right hand.
So did he become a chiropractor?
Not with two thumbs
on his right hand, he didn't.
Wait a minute.
You're from Beacontown, aren't you?
Yeah.
Now I get it. You think that I'm...
You can forget it. I'm not Scott.
I can't do what Scott did.
What's a five-letter word
for "Italian sausage"?
So that's why they gave me
a sports scholarship.
So what? Go a few rounds in the ring,
get your head knocked off. Maybe.
You get your scholarship
and everybody's happy.
- Jump into what ring?
- Just show up for practice this Thursday.
- Practice for what?
- Boxing.
"Frank". That's perfect.
Would you take it easy?
I wanna keep this scholarship
and I don't know what I'm doing.
Fat kid's a great dancer.
All right.
Ok, you wanna play rough?
I'll throw two jabs.
Come back with a right.
- Which one's the Howard kid?
- Hey, Todd.
I guess he's a little rusty.
If this is some kind of joke,
you'll notice I'm not laughing.
- I had dibs on this.
- Possession is nine tenths of the law.
So now you're a lawyer?
Thought you were a biologist.
What do you want with it anyway?
It's probably over your head.
- Over my head?
- Over any jock's head.
Jock?
Listen, I just wanna go to this school,
but I'm here on a sports scholarship
with a coach who wants me
to have two right thumbs.
My roommate sunbathes with a light bulb,
some fat kid eats all my food.
I've got Dean Dunn's dog
trying to bite my leg off.
- And you want the only book that I want?
- Shh!
Well, I'll tell you what. You can have
this book and this book and this book.
- And keep that book as well.
- Shh!
You too, buddy.
- You Ok?
- Yeah.
- Here. You want this more than I do.
- Thanks.
I... I guess I got a little
carried away in there.
I guess you did.
Hey, wait up.
"Phylum and Genus Classes
in North American Crustaceans"?
Little light reading for you, huh?
I should have known
that I'd find you in the science section.
I probably won't be needing
this book anyway.
I was science fair champion...
...in the tri-county area.
My research is
in crustacean reproduction.
How exciting.
- How's your schedule?
- It's better.
Listen, Nicki...
...I was wondering if, well...
- Would you like to...
- I'd love to.
- You would?
- Sure.
Great.
I'm busy Friday, but Saturday I'm free.
Do lab partners work on the weekends
this early in the semester?
Oh...
- I thought you were asking me if...
- Really? Oh...
Well, then you mean you'd like to?
I mean, maybe...
Maybe we can.
Hi.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye. Bye.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- About earlier...
- Don't worry. It's nothing.
- Thanks. You look nice.
- Thank you.
- You wanna dance?
- Sure.
- How's that left hook?
- It's great.
Todd Howard, I'd like you to meet
Mrs. St. Claire, one of our benefactors.
The new physics lab, Lennock field
and other endowments.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you.
I'd like you also to meet
Lisa Goldfluss and Emily Lord.
They are co-hostesses
of our reception committee.
We've met.
This fine young man carries
our hopes and dreams into the ring.
Lisa, dance with Todd.
- Dean Dunn, I really...
- Do it.
What are you smiling at? You're next.
How's your boyfriend?
I may have to dance with you,
but I don't have to talk to you.
Hey.
- You sure do sweat a lot.
- Shut up and dance.
Oh no. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh my... You're a dog.
I've been dancing with a dog.
- Yeah, I knew you had it in you.
- Hey, look out!
Dip!
Let me give you a hand with that.
Miss Goldfluss, do you
have an explanation for this?
- What are you so upset about?
- Upset, Stiles? Me, upset?
I had a beard all over my body.
Fingernails the size of French fries.
Teeth from here to Texas.
And she called me a dog. A dog!
Ok, I might be able to cut you a deal.
If they let you keep the scholarship,
you become the school mascot.
- Yeah?
- This is just the tip of the iceberg.
Everybody will be talking about you.
All you gotta do is be the wolf, Todd.
I'll do the rest.
Wonderful. Wonderful.
She called me a dog.
The bed they laid him in
was only six feet long.
His feet hung over the end.
Mary, his wife, clung to his side.
Her tears mingled with his blood.
Her prayers echoed the grief
of an entire nation.
The small projectile from the derringer
that John Wilkes Booth used
- was lodged in his left temple.
- I've got fleas. You distract him.
And all night long the vigil waited
in that small boarding house
across from Ford's Theatre
until the wee hours in the morning.
When fate dealt that final blow...
...a crowd of mourners gathered,
white, black, rich and poor.
And so, ten hours after that fatal shot,
President Abraham Lincoln...
Mr. Howard, where are you going?
Mr. Howard.
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Todd Howard. I've been wanting
to speak with you, young man.
Your disruptive behavior
at yesterday's reception
warrants my personal attention,
don't you think?
I don't like practical jokes.
I am not a funny man.
I fail to see the humor
of dressing up in a dog costume
- and trying to frighten our alumni.
- But Dean Dunn...
Don't give me any of that backtalk.
If you're trying to push me...
...you have no idea who
you're dealing with.
Your first fight is coming up.
So far I'm unimpressed.
You'd better not fail
me, because if you do,
I'll call every dean at every school
and you'll never go to
college, anywhere, ever.
Do I make myself crystal clear?
Oh!
Strange boy.
Excuse me.
The guy that turned
into a dog, what's his problem?
He's really weird.
Everybody's scratching around here.
Todd, we're looking forward
to your presentation. Are you ready?
Yeah, I think so.
Todd, I wanna see you.
That's all for today. Thank you.
- Do you wanna go to lunch?
- You don't wanna be seen with a dog.
- Do you wanna go to lunch, or not?
- I've gotta go see the professor.
They're giving you
a hard time, aren't they?
- I'm your advisor. Maybe I can help.
- I don't think so.
Well, I'd like to try. You have a talent
for science. Let's start with that.
No matter what anyone says or does,
don't lose sight of your goals.
I wanted to study hard
and become a veterinarian.
I can help you with that.
You're a very bright young man, Todd.
You'll find a way to deal
with your other problems.
If you only knew, Professor Brooks.
I'll do my very best to try and understand.
- I'm always here if you need me.
- Ok.
Hope you're hungry.
I've got a ton of stuff here.
- You like chicken, don't you?
- Why are you doing this?
'Cause I'm hungry.
- Drumstick?
- You know what I mean.
Biologically speaking it's absolutely
fascinating what's happened to you.
If you think I'm gonna
feel sorry for you, forget it.
But I'm a dog.
You'll be Ok. You will.
One, two, three. You're out of here.
Bring the doctor in here.
- How many does that make?
- Three for them. None for us.
You're up next, big guy.
- But coach, this isn't my weight class.
- That'll be my problem. Go on.
Hey, what if I...?
- He outweighs my guy by 50 pounds.
- It's all water weight, look at him.
Look tough, Chubby.
Let's box.
Hey, what are you doing?
- Put him down.
- Put him down.
- Put me down.
- I'm warning you.
All right. Let's box.
- You pig.
- Come on.
- Come on.
- No more. Let's box.
Use your weight, Chub.
Ok. Break. Break.
Get over there.
Hamilton!
That's the last fight you win.
All right, Chubby.
All right. Let's take him.
Get out there, babe.
Ok, get in there.
Ok, let's box!
Next.
Next.
Don't worry. There's a
good hospital on campus.
Let's get this over with.
I've got a date in a half hour.
♪ Let's go, big blue, let's go
Let's go, big blue, let's go
This makes or breaks your career.
Let's go, Pug.
- You're gonna die.
- I know.
Move, move, move!
Knock him out!
Great move.
I'll break your kneecaps
if you don't keep still and let me hit you.
Come on, Pug.
- All right.
- Yeah!
All right. Get back. Come on.
You're history.
I knew Pug would win that fight.
- You Ok, kid? One...
- Todd, get up. Come on.
Don't lie there like a fish.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Holy shit!
Yeah!
- What is this?
- It's that dog you were dancing with.
- Do you wanna stop the fight?
- Hell no. Go on.
All right. Box.
Stay away from him, Pug.
Nail him, Todd. Nail him.
Pug, come on!
Get in there and kill him!
A right hook. He can fight.
Murder him!
- Pug!
- You're out.
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeehaw!
Have no fear, Stiles is here.
Ok, we're gonna rock.
Brewskies are coming. We're gonna
have a party and have so much fun.
- What are you waiting for?
- We need music!
Is this thing on? Can you hear me?
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a very special guest with us.
Not only does our Teen Wolf
throw a punch like lightning,
but he sings too.

Come and see Stiles.
I've got the stuff for you.
I got T-shirts, anything you want.
Break, break!
The championship is two weeks away.
It's down to you and that wolf.
Any predictions?
Every dog has his day. And his is mine.
Hello?
- Emily.
- Stiles.
- Go away.
- What?
You don't mind, do you, buddy?
Lisa...
- Hey, Todd.
- Stiles, beat it.
Chubby.
Chubby? Chub?
Chubby?
- Chubby.
- What?
I've created a monster.
Mmm...
Hmm?
That smell is disgusting.
Ok, so I was absent
the day you guys did this.
- Are you mad at me?
- Ha!
- You're jealous.
- What?
Of those two leeches you hang around with?
You can't even see it, can you?
They don't like you, only the wolf.
Look, just because everything
is going great for me
doesn't give you the right
to go off and start...
- You just hit me with a dead frog.
- Jerk.
Jerk?
Frog fight!
Incoming!
What is going on here?
Frog fighting in my lab?
Put those things away.
That's the end of class for today.
Except for you.
I wanna talk to you.
I've been talking with
your other professors.
I know about the car, your grades
and how you're coasting through.
When you have a gift,
you have a responsibility to use it wisely.
You're not. And you're
only letting yourself down.
- Are you in a hurry?
- Actually, I have to get to practice.
Team's nothing without the wolf.
You can't expect the wolf
to solve all your problems.
You do realize
you have finals coming up, don't you?
- Yeah, regional finals?
- No, course finals.
Listen, I don't think I need this class.
You told me to choose the right path.
And with the road that I've chosen...
...I don't think I need biology at all.
I'm very sorry to hear that.
You waited for me?
I don't know why.
I never thought I'd say it,
but I miss the old Todd.
What happened?
- He turned into a werewolf.
- But that's not the real you.
The wolf lets me do what I wanna do.
It's a gift.
- I have a responsibility to myself...
- Responsibility?
What about school? Or being a veterinarian?
What about you and me?
My feelings for you are real.
They have nothing to do with the wolf.
Those others could care
less about the real you.
Look, I'm late and you're wrong.
That's the way it's done, girls.
Watch this.
We'll play through.
How can you take him seriously?
He's a freshman.
With an awful lot of hair.
Why don't you shut your mouth?
- Let's settle this man to man.
- I don't fight chipmunks.
Not here, Gus.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
You die in the ring, pal.
Fore!
It's in the hole.
You guys studying?
Yes, some of us
actually have to take finals.
Mr. Stilinsky...
...what say you, me and the wolf
take the wheels for a little...
...spin?
- Nope.
- Huh, huh?
How about you, big guy?
I might even let you drive.
What do you say?
I'm busy. Ok?
- See you, Stiles.
- See you, Chub.
- Check 46.
- You know what's funny?
I wanted you to become the wolf
more than anybody else.
So I guess I'm partly to blame
for what you've become.
What have I become?
- A jerk, Todd.
- Aw...
Thank you for coming. I...
I really need to talk to you.
- You're in a tough spot, huh?
- Yeah.
I just let it get out of hand.
I mean, I know you... you warned me.
And I guess I should've
listened, because...
...I got a little crazy, Uncle Harold,
and I ended up hurting
a lot of people that I really care about.
What are you gonna do about it?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
Well, don't be too tough on yourself.
After all, you're only human too.
So?
So you made a mistake.
You admitted it. It's over.
Maybe it's time you were Todd Howard again.
I'm scared.
Really scared.
If I'm myself in this ring tomorrow,
I could get killed.
I don't think you're gonna get killed.
This guy's really big. He's huge.
Never mind him.
'Cause what I'm interested in is you
and what you've got right there.
What does that matter
when the guy is twice your size?
- Well...
- I wouldn't stand a chance.
Maybe not.
But sometimes you have to make
a stand. Even if you don't want to.
- What's that?
- Boxing gloves. They used to belong to me.
- In college I used to box, too.
- Really?
Yeah, I can show you some moves
nobody's seen in 30 years.
- Now when's this big match?
- Tomorrow.
Plenty of time.
- What are you doing?
- Studying.
I still have two more finals.
I guess you wouldn't know about that.
Nicki...
...I'm real sorry.
For everything.
- I guess the wolf makes you a jerk.
- No, I'm a jerk.
I just hope that there's still time
to make up for it all.
- There's still time to try.
- I wanna try.
You can start by saying you're really sorry
for mistreating someone you like.
I'm sorry for mistreating someone...
...I really love.
- You missed your final.
- What?
Your final.
I'm sure Professor Brooks flunked you.
Oh? Yeah.
- Maybe we could talk to her.
- Yeah.
- Professor Brooks? Hi.
- Hi.
We were just coming to see you.
Listen, I know
I probably don't deserve it, but...
...if you would give me a second chance,
I'd really like to earn my grade.
You can take a make up exam
tomorrow at noon at the latest.
I have to turn the grades in
by the end of the day.
- I have a fight at three.
- The test takes three hours.
- Take it or leave it.
- We'll take it.
Yeah, thank you very much.
It's time.
- Good luck on your test.
- Thanks.
And at the match.
- Will you come see me box?
- Yeah.
- Good luck.
- Bye.
Well, that's the best I could do.
I missed a few classes.
It looks like you did well enough
to pass the course.
Great.
Professor Brooks,
I really wanna thank you for trying to help
when things got a little crazy.
Welcome back.
- Where have you been?
- Taking a final.
Where's the wolf?
You got to go fight in
the 145 pound class now.
That's Peter's weight class.
- Yeah, so what?
- Look coach, we are a team.
We're gonna fight as a team.
And I am going up against Gus.
That's great.
All of you go and get your brains
knocked out. That'll be attractive.

Ok, Peter. Peter, you're next. Go on up.
Sorry, I'm busy right now.
I know what you're doing.
I know about the car...
...the grades and the promises.
And I want you to lay off.
Todd Howard has a future here,
but it's not in the ring.
Who do you think you're talking to?
He'll do exactly as I say.
- You don't own him.
- Is this your idea of a threat?
No... this is.
You don't know who you're dealing with.
- Yeah!
- Chubby, come on!
Box!
Cut. He's out.
Let him go. Come on.
Put him down.
Put him down so I can count.
Let's go. Come on.
He's out.
All right, Chubby!
Come on out, dude.
Chubby, Chubby!
Ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to the
Hamilton University Memorial Arena.
Now entering the arena,
three-time state champion
from the Nimitz Academy
weighing in at 200 pounds
Steve "Gus" Gustavson!
Boo!
Yeah! All right!
Steve "Gus" Gustavson!
Yeah, yeah, number one! Come on, yeah!
Now entering the arena, weighing in
at 195 wild and woolly pounds,
Hamilton's own Todd "The Wolf" Howard!
Wolf, wolf, wolf, wolf!
Todd "The Wolf" Howard.
Where's the wolf?
Hey, where's the wolf?
What's he doing?
Come on. Are you crazy?
- Come on!
- Oh man!
- What is the meaning of this?
- Tactics?
I'll have him kicked out of this college.
Dean Dunn?
I won't be needing these anymore.
It's my last fight.
Good. I hope he kills you.
He probably will.
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Are you kidding?
Pays to be positive, big guy.
Box!
He made such a great wolf.
Kill him, Todd!
Come on. Hit me. Come on.
Come on. Hit me. Come on.
Come on. Hit me.
My grandmother hits harder than that.
Take that.
Come on.
Good round.
- Come on. Try that with me, you freak.
- Come on. Come on.
- Let go of me.
- Calm down. Round's over. Get back.
Back. I'm warning you.
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.
Cut the ring off on him.
How are you doing?
Are you feeling Ok? Keep 'em up.
- How's the ribs?
- Chubby.
- How's the jaw?
- Ow!
- I'm sorry I called the wolf a jerk.
- I was a jerk.
If you don't turn back into the jerk,
we're gonna get killed.
It's gotta be this way.
Coach, you got anything to say to me?
Well, um...
...no.
- Go and kick some butt, Todd.
- Take him out.
Break, break.
- Step back.
- He's a baby. Come on.
Let's box.
Come on, get up.
- Come on.
- Ow! Ow!
- Break.
- Let go of me, you sissy.
Let him go. Break. Break, I said. Box.
Get him. Go ahead.
Come on. Come on!
Sit down.
- That's an early bell.
- Oh God.
Come on, ref. Keep your eyes open.
Now listen.
Unless you wanna wolf out,
I suggest we throw in the towel.
I'm not quitting.
Todd!
It's not as bad as it looks.
You're way ahead on points.
Keep fighting the same fight.
Look at his face over there.
That guy's in trouble.
You got it? Go! Get him!
Touch gloves. Last round. Box.
Go, Todd, go!
Do it!
- I'm gonna make you howl with pain.
- It's gonna be a long night.
Come on.
Get back in the ring. Let's go.
He's gonna kill him.
Somebody do something.
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Are you all right?
Get back. Get back in there.
- Where are you going?
- Home.
Ok. Let's box.
One.
Two, three.
Four.
Get up! Get up!
Six.
I love you.
Seven.
Eight, nine.
Come on, Gus!
Come on, dog. Fight like a man.
Give me your best shot.
Oh!
Break. Break.
Stand back.
He's out!

Todd Howard!
