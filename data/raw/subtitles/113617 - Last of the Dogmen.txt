To be exact
Warrior-dog?
Among the Cheyennes, the bravest
Formed a military company
They were fierce warriors
They were called men-dogs

For the rest of the tribe

Nobody's doing breeding, high-là
And that climbs
Non-shod horses?
The lndiens? Is it that?

We voilà
Towards the end of 1864,
Many tribes
Looting, stealing, went
Guilty of all kinds of atrocities
One of the few heads cheyennes
Who really wanted peace
Was Black Cauldron
He set up his camp at Sand Creek,
Near Fort Lyon
In the evening, there was a feast
With dances and games
To celebrate peace
The following day, November 29,
Was frigid dawn
A group of volunteers
Colorado encercla camp
They were ordered
Remove their tunics
Bizarre, no?
Black Cauldron fit hoist the flag
American and the white flag
The lndiens paniquèrent
But they cried
They had nothing to fear,
They had been promised protection
Suddenly, the troops attaquèrent
The 2 / 3 of lndiens
Were women and children
The chaos was total.
It was a massacre
The blood of dead bodies frozen immediately
Then looting began
They taillèrent of scalps,
Fingers, ears, nose
They arrachèrent foetuses
To the matrix
The soldiers accrochèrent
To their hats
When they were handed
Their own tunic
They défilèrent to Denver with
Uniforms decorated with human debris
Twenty men, women
And children managed to escape
With Loup Solitaire,
Head men-dogs
The military continued
Keep to two states
To the mountains of Montana
The blizzard interrupted hunting,
On the left for dead lndiens
Hold. Loup Solitaire
Voilà
You know everything
It is late.
I am tired. Good night
Wait. See?
Ça colle
Imagine ...
If by chance,
A miracle ...
If Loup Solitaire and Cheyennes
Had survived?
-- If it was their descendants?
-- They did not survive
How do you know?
Famine, in the winter.
They did not survive
You are more sûre?
If there were lndiens
In the Oxbow, we would have seen
Not necessarily
You are crazy
Take the wolf
We now know that there
Wolves in the Oxbow, right?
I saw their footsteps,
I heard their screams
-- I never saw
-- It's different
It's the same
It's different
Elvis Presley is dead
The UFOs do not exist, there
No Cheyennes in the Oxbow
Why are more if you têtue?
Because I like it
You saw something
The inexplicable. I believe
But I have no time to lose.
I have used the facts
Now, I lie down
Take the sofa if you want
I warn you,
I promène naked in the morning
Quadrilatère of Oxbow
This is the complete collection
Our numbers
93 years
Voilà, my little
Happy hunting
A hunter disappears
Friday, March 16, 1935
Searches are interrupted
6 killed in the Oxbow
Capture of a enfantsauvage
'A half-dead from hunger ...
"Hallo nicknamed
"Do not speak a word of English"
Retirement home
It's going, Mr. Hollis?
When will they
Fish in the river?
The guard tells me that fishing
The river is full of fish
It is a liar.
When I was a kid ...
Say hello to Mr. Gates
He came to see you
Full of fish, my ass
You are who you are?
Sometimes I ask myself
Pass me a asticot
You are working on rail
And not any
The Great Northern Pacific.
During 53 years
Tell me about Hallo
Well then it!
-- So, you remember
-- If I recall?
If anything, I had caught
How did it go?
There are long
More than I thought
At 35, I believe it was
Ed Vallee and I, we went back
The course of Kootenay
To repair a siding
A little after noon,
We saw something on the road
I thought it was a deer
I saw that it was a boy
Ed arrêté train
And he ran after
The voilà!
He was chased
Finally a wedge
Close to the river
From nearby, we saw that it was India.
He spoke no English
-- It grognait
-- What have you done?
Ed and I, we knew too
It was cold, I covered
With my shirt
He was taken to the sheriff Case,
Which put him in cell
Not because he knew where to put
He was nicknamed Hallo
With his eyes to bouille
He looked
Lanterns for Halloween
On the morning
He disappeared
He had slipped dû
Through the bars at night
Nobody has ever reviewed
The Sheriff contacted
Reserves corner
But it has not been effective
Nobody knew who was
Or where he came from
And after you?
I know nothing
But I ask you
What is a small lndien
"In the middle of nowhere
To one hundred terminals
From the nearest town?
This photo was taken
To the arrival of young Cheyennes
At the Carlisle Indian School,
Pennsylvania
The same ones, 14 months later
They had been cut hair,
Given names Christians
And forbidden to speak their language
Thus began
Official policy
To be against tribes submitted
The policy of ...
I assimilation policy
Religious and cultural
Should we talk
Look at it
17 persons disappeared
In the Oxbow since 1898.
Bizarre, while the same
The cap is screwed?
It is not everything
In 1935
We found a young lndien,
Near the Oxbow
He spoke not a word of English
I saw the man who was found
A kid who ignores the English
And vanishes into thin air
Explain to me it
You will not believe the facts,
Right?
In voilà, facts
What do you want from me?
I returned
If I am right, I want to not finish
On the list
I need someone to speak
Cheyenne. One of your students?
Only a few days.
A round trip. Three days
If they are, I know
And you too, boy
I am a little pressed dépêchons
It does me no good
Calm down. He seems fairly competent
I am suspicious of him
In saddle. It was a long way to making
Good luck
Say it!
What are you doing?
I checked the caliper
No question. Come back!
Do not listen.
It will be seen in three days
Go ahead
You said: if they are,
I know
This is not a picnic,
My little lady
I saw tears
Men hardened here
It is not the place of a woman
You are really
A cowboy, huh?
What is it with you?
"Y has no time to lose"?
Defense cross the line
It should perhaps be resting
If you are tired
The smell is ...
Interesting.
What is it?
The ragoût survival Lewis Gates
What Lewis Gates met inside?
What he finds
When I was little
I hated camping
All bêtes me terrifiaient
And I chose a career
That makes me live outdoors
Most of the time
It's funny, life
Today, life in the wild
Wild, I find it invigorating
I fell on Wonder Woman
I have aspirin
No need for aspirin, please
What mood
I agreed to go,
But it does not m'enchante
Not treat me like a kid
I do not pay
"A.G.?"
Abraham Gates,
My grand-father
You are very conservative
It depends
-- So?
-- Not bad
Outside the goût
It's going, I heard
You make your food
It is always like that?
You will not
Walk naked tomorrow morning?
I will try to get empêcher
It was here that I found
The cursor and the tracks
I guided hunters here
But never
Cross this crête
The tracks are a step in that direction
Does the good weather will hold?
Really?
Old Indian know?
The weather, to the radio
Attention to
The filth shale
Make your steps.
If your horse falls
Not with luck
Thanks for the hose
Move especially not
I told you
To be careful
This is not college, here
The slightest mistake can kill
I will gladly pass
Command
You can see the rope?
Catch it at two hands
And you?
Do what I say!
Prête?
Three!
Emmène the horse!
It's good!
That's right. Good dog!
Tire-la!
Ski the
You Doing?
I am only
A little baffled
That the most intelligent
Of the expedition is a dog
In saddle.
We still have 2 hours of day
Want goûter?
Wait, I give thee
C'est bon?
T'en want?
You are really
In your element here, right?
I like solitude
These days, it seems
That I do feel good
Qu'à 200 terminals
The rest of humanity
You are born a century too late
My wife said
The saying?
She died two years ago
Sorry
She was sick?
On passing through a river to horse
His has désarçonnée.
I dived
The current was too strong
In a second, it disappeared ...
His father wants me
Still
What would you have done?
Me drown
And you? You were married?
Only to my work
Make no mistake.
I have known men
With some, it worked
That's me that sets the rules
If me, I have an overdue century
You have one in advance
Russell and his wife have found
Lewis was at the Chronicle
The other day
He spent three hours
To look back issues
What do you factories, Gates?
You want?
With joy
From whiskey.
It's good for your health
Simple curiosity
Lndiens Why?
Because I admire
We are their debtors
How are you?
They gave us myths,
Legends
They gave us a story
They must character
Of our nation
They were strangely grateful,
?
What happened was inevitable
The way it happened
Beyond comprehension
If that remains a drop ...
I like a pumpkin head,
Thanks to you
I have aspirin
Bravo. A bête made a hole
In my duvet
Traces?
By earth. How many fingers?
Four
No doubt a small rodent
The chipmunks, muskrats,
Squirrels
Have all 4 fingers before,
5 behind. The others were 5 and 5
The weasels,
That's another story
They walk
On the soles of the feet
The soles of the feet
There is one week left since
I said 3 days.
Let's turn
It was romantic,
Lndiens of the Oxbow
The idea hooked me
But ...
We have to do better
That the hunt for ghosts
In college, if we learned,
I would interner
Why did I
Convinced?
I have to give courses
I have a life
It closed the camp and we go
Understood?
You heard me?
You want to go?
I am an anthropologist,
I am not Daniel Boone
You saw my gourd?
Where is my gourd?
I hate camping
What did you take?
The voilà, your gourd
Very slowly
Iâchez your gun
Do it
-- Over a gesture
-- I can breathe?
Look at them
-- What do they say?
-- I am not sûre
What?
I said:
"We came in peace '
And that you are a great warrior
Who would not be afraid
To face
It's a joke
The Cheyennes admire the bravery
Let's hope they do not check
Otherwise, I take you first
-- Hang up
-- Not Move
They will kill you!
You were right. These are
Warriors-dogs cheyennes
In my life
I would not have believed
And yet
We reboard
In time
This is an extraordinary opportunity
Pardon. I am not
As hard as I thought
Yeah, right!
It can no longer walk
It needs a horse
A horse!
It is weak! A horse!
Ça ira
Look, Ducon,
You give to him a horse
Or we kill you right away
You are talking not my language,
But you understand, right?
Then choose
Give me the
You are exhausted
J'espère it was friendly
Incredible
Useless
The lndien ahead of the boy scout.
The nodes are solid
What will they do with us?
I do not know
You the expert, right?
They could kill us
But often, captives
Were absorbed into the tribe
Absorbed?
They treated so well
That the captives often refused
To return home
That's their hospitality m'ébahit
You can not blame them,
They are afraid of us
He called Zip
How do you say thank you?
-- We must follow
-- Not without my dog
You have no choice
What?
It Elan Tacheté
Ie last surviving son
De Loup Solitaire
He asked whether we want to
Back behind iron bars
When he was a child,
White had put in a cage
Hallo
What did you learn about this frimeur?
That Yellow Wolf
Ie first-warriors dogs,
It will succeed Chief
It's really manly,
To shoot a dog
Enjoy
They have not eaten
It's also why
They are called dog-warriors
We will stay here
They speak
Many of Cheyennes killed
From the flight of his father
Before the white soldiers
There was a tempête
The lndiens
Were lost and hungry
A wolf appeared to them
That took them in the valley
The wolf parla
Theirenvironment saying to stay here
Hidden to the white man for ever
They survived
It was during the moon
Where the deer lose their wood
There are 128 winters
What will happen là below?
I do not know
They hunted,
His son moved away
Three whites have shot
Yellow Wolf and his family killed
It is brûlant
The infection has become widespread
What does it take him?
Try to convince them, j'irai
It is not he who decides
The siens survived
All this time without the help of whites
The request today
Attract misfortune
Any penicillin
You will find
It's hard
Without a prescription, right?
A little imagination
That's
I need my gun
And my stabbing
The stabbing
One last thing
-- What do you do?
-- For Zip
That idiot
I regret
I do not pay service
Unless the accounts are settled
I like that, that's all
It accompanies you
Be careful
If you do not come back,
They kill me
It is like that, that's all
While sweet, but sweet
Well done, my beautiful
I am to you
But I told you ...
This is not
In our country
Nobody more bump
Signal Alarm
To the pharmacy Canmore
Be not like it
I am grand-father
Calm down.
T'as of penicillin?
In a bag
Bouge.
I called in reinforcements
Why?
Stay where you are
Range it
It plays more
I t'arrête
It's my thief!
Rule number one: never
Suspect leave the eye
Arrête!
Arrête yourself even
Remove
What are you doing?
Look at it
Fugitive in Oxbow
Quadrilatère of Oxbow
It will draw?
It's too early to say
The survival ragoût
Lewis Gates, good
And good for your health. Goûtez
Hold, goûtez
You know not what you miss
It's nice, but I ...
It is their way of saying thanks.
The refusal is an insult
Very nice
What this fourbi?
Like all rich singles.
Find a Wife
Very funny
Hard to swallow?
You knew?
Over time
Elan Tacheté brought me here
Some items the intriguaient
They sometimes hunt
Out of the valley
They meet White
They hide,
But those who are approaching too ...
Finissent here
You do not protect tueriez
Your family and traditions?
He wondered about the bird money
To the long tail
I said we walked on the moon
He said that although I Lie
He asked how living
Other Cheyennes
What you say?
The truth
You hear?
I waited all my life
To hear it
I will tell you
It owes nothing happen to them
Nobody should discover
Person
Who?
My step-father
How have they found?
It leaves us how much?
They are to 5 km from the fall.
A half-day
Elan Tacheté wants to leave the valley
Yellow Wolf him,
Wants to stay to fight
They are being massacred
The Cheyennes or others?
If we did diversion?
It would give them more time
Now, no more mistreats
The Cheyennes
Think to us well
We are all parents
We must present exchange
They have already taken everything
Now,
You are the same heart that we
You are a Cheyenne. Go in peace
I would think that your ragoût
I would miss
Forget it. In saddle
Another trip
That you must do it alone
I asked to Elan Tacheté
To remain with them
A horse
My work began to penalty
I would note,
Any record
Develop the memorial
Recent Cheyennes
You are crazy?
I spent my life to teach
Here, today, with them,
C'est moi l'élève
My place is with them
I remain
Recognize therefore
What you embête
I will miss
Allons-y
Nothing that we both, apparently
Not you too
I think not
I always knew
A woman separates us
T'es better here goes
Là where I go, it's going to PR
Sleep on it
He sleeps with
Toi same -
It should help
If old, it still works?
The dynamite? It's like wine
It improves with age
Slowly
Watch
In the long run, it seeps
The Nitro, boum
So, goodbye
Make me a promise
Whatever happens,
As badly as it turns
Empêchez them
Eating my dog
It promised
You walk really naked,
In the morning?
The weasels walk really
On the soles of the feet?
A farewell kiss?
It is time
You call that a kiss?
It's better
I am good élève
Too tight?
Pardon for another day.
I have nothing against you
Y has a cave at mid-slope
It crosses the waterfall
A horse, guys
T'as wrong
You are going to kill them
Forward
Easy!
I kill you on the spot
Leave your weapon
Immediately
Easy does it
He is wounded
It does what?
Half turn!
I need a helping hand
You have saved his life
T'as done for me what
T'as not have done for my daughter
I would have preferred as the opposite
When you want, I think
It is time to talk
Nobody here, including me
No one wants to see you in taule
For a flight of penicillin
It abandons prosecution
But it is necessary that I know
In this gallery,
Before the explosion
I believed see ...
What is out there?
- What you think is out there?
- OK.
Fine.
What ever you are proteing?
I hope it worth is.
