EVIL DEAD TRAP
(Shiryo No Wana)
Good evening.
Welcome to "Late Night With Nami."
Designed especially for
those of you who can't sleep.
So far the home videos you sent
haven 't been very good.
If you want yours to get on the air
it's gotta be better.
Rewind a few frames more.
Yes there.
She looks like our mother.
Hideki.
Dinner is ready.
Come and eat.
COFFEE
What? When did this arrive?
For Nami
and those who can't sleep
Someday I'd like to have
a job with normal hours.
Let's take a look.
Again. This kind ofvideo.
What the hell?
It's me.
Me!
You're overreacting to this.
It's just a kid's prank.
- What should we do about it?
- Are you kidding?
We should use it.
We should go to the location.
Investigate.
- See if it's real.
- That's irresponsible.
If we give attention to it we'd
only be encouraging sick behavior.
You might get killed.
But it's newsworthy and my death
would bring high ratings.
A tasteless joke.
Besides we're over budget.
- Who says so?
- The boss.
You know I support you and
your program has a good audience...
but the executives are worried.
Your show is gaining
a fluff reputation.
That's why this is important.
If you want to go then go.
But we're out of it.
So the boy-wonder gave
a halfhearted approval.
And if we go we'll learn
the truth about the tape.
But what if we find a dead body?
That'd be great!
A top story!
We'd all become famous.
Then let's go.
Rei are you coming?
Eh? Only women going?
Sounds dangerous.
We can take care of ourselves.
Nami do you really want to go?
See? If Nami says yes
then we should all go.
- Can I try one of these dresses?
- Yes.
- Nami would you check--
- Good morning.
A big mail delivery
for you guys.
Pathetic letters
from late-night nerds.
What do you mean by that?
Are you calling my script nerdy?
Just a joke.
- Kondou.
- Yes.
- Do you like horror?
- I love horror movies.
Good. Then you can
be our chaperone.
I don't think so.
Honestly.
Whenever I do things foryou
I end up in trouble.
- Here.
- Thankyou.
I wonder who really
made that video.
Probably some dirty old man...
who wants to wear Nami's underwear
on his nasty oily head.
Do you thinkwe'll
be home before dark?
It's only 1 :00 now.
I have a dinner date tonight.
Rei you have a dinner date
every night.
You must save a lot
on groceries.
What are you trying to say?
- What was that?
- A dog.
Okay. Let's go.
- My hamburger fell.
- What a mess.
- Are you all right Rei?
- I'm fine. Just a bump.
- Is everybody okay?
- Just some hamburger casualties.
Don't worry.
We're here.
Nami is this really here?
Yeah.
Something's wrong.
This isn't on the map.
It's supposed to be an empty field.
It looks like
some kind of factory.
Looks like it.
- Maybe there's another way in.
- Yes.
No way.
Oh shit.
It's open.
But this may not be
such a good idea.
Everything looks dead
around here.
It won't be so bad.
You'll see.
Are there any more hamburgers?
- You want more to eat?
- I didn't finish the other one.
- Here.
- Thankyou.
You want this one
that's smashed on the floor?
- Let's stop the car here.
- Sure.
Looks like a big place.
Yeah.
How should we do this?
I think we'll split
into groups of two...
and meet back here in an hour.
But that means
one of us will be alone.
- I'll go alone.
- No I'll go by myself.
No you stay with Rei.
She's afraid.
Okay.
- Rei let's go.
- Huh?
Aren't you coming?
Yeah sorry.
I'm coming.
We'll go this way.
I'm sorry about the other night.
I guess it was because of
the bourbon. It made me feel weird.
You were impotent not weird.
That hurts my feelings.
What if I'm unable
to get an erection now?
Stop talking about your penis.
We're supposed to be working now.
Is anybody here?
Anybody?
Who?
Who are you?
Why are you here?
Shouldn't I be
asking you that?
This isn't a playground.
I work for a television station.
We're following a news story.
I know nothing about television.
Where I live
we have no such things.
Be careful.
Keep your guard up.
You didn't tell me
what you're doing here.
I'm looking for someone.
I'll be going.
Who?
It seems odd.
Like everyone suddenly
disappeared without warning.
Where are you?
What is this?
What kind of chaperone are you?
Who's there?
Who's there? Kondou?
Kondou!
Damn you!
Asshole!
You broke my glasses.
You didn't have to do that.
Why'd you scare me?
Leave me alone.
I'm horny today.
Good for you.
- I could do it.
- What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Listen. Don't you think
it's really strange?
Nami seems to be obsessed
with this place.
Don't say stupid things.
This could be big news.
Quite a break.
Eh? You too?
We don't get much attention
just because we're women.
It's tough to make it
in a man's world.
We need a big news story
to get respect.
Otherwise...
you know what will happen.
Think about Nami's stress.
She's under a lot of pressure.
In case you haven't noticed
I'm under pressure too.
You're ruining my pictures. Move.
Hey are my clothes clean?
There's dirt everywhere.
Shit.
Everybody will know
what we've been doing.
How embarrassing.
Stupid. That's not how.
I'll find a sink.
Wait. Rei!
What's wrong?
Nami it's you.
You're out of breath.
Where's Masako?
Eh? She's taking pictures.
She likes the atmosphere.
Nami can we go?
Why? Is something wrong?
Not really but I feel
something strange here.
Something's not right.
It's starting to cool off.
We should head back soon.
Let's find the others.
Okay.
It's the place--
the place from the video.
What are you doing now?
Kondou come out.
Hear me?
You'll never learn.
Do you think the video is real?
She didn't appear to be acting.
You think somebody
killed a girl on camera...
and then sent the video to us?
I think it was intended
as an invitation to me.
No way. Then we should
definitely leave.
This might be our job
but enough already! Let's go.
It's not just our job.
Aren't you a bit curious
to meet him?
Not at all.
Who knows what
that freak might do?
Hey. What are you
doing in here?
Look. You made me
spill my drink.
I think the video is perfect
for "Late Night."
- A nasty love letter to you Nami.
- Don't take that video so lightly.
Don't panic.
The sun is still out.
- Dracula only comes out at night.
- Everybody knows that.
Where's Rei?
Nami come quickly!
I found the place. Come see.
Look it's over there.
Rei we'll be right back..
Wait for us.
- Can we get in?
- Yeah.
I don't think it's locked.
Isn't this the place?
- It smells like mildew.
- Yeah.
- It's really dark in here.
- Uh-huh.
What is this place?
No windows anywhere.
Just look quickly.
Can you flash it again?
Just lots of televisions.
- And the windows are covered.
- Mmm.
Why would the windows be covered?
Idiot.
Nami we should do
something about him.
Stop shining that.
It's too bright.
Hey.
- What's that noise?
- Eh?
It's Rei.
Rya! Wait! Rya!
Come back!
Rya!
Light?
Police. We need to
contact the police.
I'll get them.
I'll get help!
We shouldn't have come here.
What? What's that?
Snap the flash.
Is something there?
I don't know.
It looks like a cell.
What happened?
Somebody inside...
attacked me.
- Masako hurry!
- I'm coming!
Nami!
Kondou!
What?
My camera!
You went inside
so I have orders to kill you.
Same with your friends.
It's fun to kill!
But it's most fun
to do it slowly.
Let me tell you.
They killed my girlfriend.
They cut her eyes out.
It was so vicious
even I was afraid.
I don't understand.
Who do you mean? Who is "they"?
They are two.
But they are really one.
Two in one.
Stop!
Where am I?
Mako?
Kondou?
Did you know you're bleeding?
How many?
How many what?
How many others died before him?
Kondou!
But how?
I'm truly sorry.
But he was dead before I got here.
- Why?
- I told you earlier.
This is no playground.
Want some of this?
Medicine.
Come on.
What-- What is this place?
It's an old military base.
When I was a child
my brother and I played here.
Then you know this place!
Where's the exit?
You shouldn't try to move.
We don't know what they'll do.
I bet you even know
who the killer is.
Do you know where he is?
Tell me. Do you know?
You ask questions like a cop.
Take it easy.
Stop doing that!
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to do.
People are getting killed here.
If you know what's going on
tell me.
I don't talk.
I lived in a small room
for too long.
Sometimes days would pass
before I saw a living person.
Prison?
Something like that.
But not quite.
It was like this place.
Who were you looking for?
Earlier.
For my brother.
Your brother?
Where is he?
Hideki?
I know it's you.
Quit being a nuisance.
What's going on?
What are you doing over there?
Are you all right?
Don't move.
Here.
Help me.
Nami.
Please help me. Nami.
Mako!
Nami. Help me. Nami!
Mako!
Where are you?
Mako! Where?
Mako?
Mako! Where are you?
Where Mako?
Where?
Where are you Mako?
Where are you? Where?
Answer me Mako!
Help me.
The last door on the right.
Mako are you there? Mako!
Mako.
Mako.
Not fair.
Kill me.
Just kill me.
But why are you killing people?
Why do you enjoy it?
I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid of you.
Do you hear me?
You can't beat me.
Stop!
Damn it. He's gone.
Are you all right?
Bite down.
It didn't hit your bone.
You should be okay.
Can you walk?
Here?
I know a secret way out.
Why are you telling me this now?
I saw the killer.
It's a child.
Child?
Are you sure it's a child?
Here. Hold this.
Hot.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I'll take it.
You coming?
Through here.
Give me the light.
Where does this lead? Outside?
To the woods.
I wonder who the child is.
Maybe he's one of my fans.
Eh? Are you an actress?
No a television reporter.
For Network 3.
Go in front of me
with the light.
That's good.
Not a fan.
I'd say a fanatic.
It looks like
he's trying to scare you.
I'd say he's obsessed
and wants to see you naked.
But I'm not that famous.
All this is unnecessary.
If he wanted to meet me
he could just visit the station.
Would you get naked
for a station visitor?
A big difference.
What's wrong?
Don't worry.
Sometimes this happens.
It'll pass in a few seconds.
Thankyou.
Isn't that hot?
I was born this way.
I have almost no sense of pain.
My brother's the same way.
Do you have a family?
I used to have a brother
but he died when I was young.
You're better off.
They're selfish.
Little brothers
always want your stuff.
Then when they don't get it
they get mad.
Are you all right?
Were you close to
your brother Hideki?
You mentioned his name earlier
when I saw you.
So I did.
Hideki and I are close.
Perhaps... the killer
has captured him too.
Is that possible?
Why are you standing there?
Aren't you afraid?
Of course I'm afraid.
But you make me feel better.
Come on.
We're almost out of here.
I hope so.
Can you use this?
I've used guns before.
Once on the TV program...
we did a special on firearms.
I see.
Take it.
Just go straight ahead.
What about you?
I'm looking for my brother.
Going back?
Don't.
The killer is no problem for me.
Then take this.
You should see your face.
Is that the face of a celebrity?
Rya.
Rya.
You wanted to get home.
But now...
you'll never get there.
And Rei had a dinner date.
Mako was worried about the ratings.
What have I caused for my friends?
Damn it.
I'm sorry.
Hidek.i it's time
foryou to go to sleep.
You have school tomorrow.
Not again!
You went out.
You're lik.e a k.ite
with a brok.en string.
Hidek.i it's time
foryou to go to sleep.
You have school tomorrow.
Not again!
You went out.
You're lik.e a k.ite
with a brok.en string.
Hidek.i where have you been?
I toldyou it's time for school.
I won 't lie to your teacher again.
Hidek.i where have you been?
I toldyou it's time for school.
I won 't lie to your teacher again.
Hidek.i where have you been?
I toldyou it's time for school.
I won 't lie to your teacher again.
Mom?
Do they--
Do they think it's me?
Stop it. I told you
not to play with dead bodies.
Stay out of my way Hideki.
You've succeeded only in
making a big mess here.
Why did you let her go?
Killing four people
is enough for one day.
I know why you
really let her go.
- What do you mean?
- You're too soft.
I could've done it
without any effort.
I couldn't use you.
You're getting too strong.
I'm doing the best I can.
Brother you're a liar.
But it doesn't matter.
She's standing over there.
- What did you say?
- She's standing at the door.
Didn't I tell you to leave?
I couldn't walk away from this.
You're a troublemaker.
Did you want a news story
that badly?
I am responsible
for the death of my friends.
I couldn't simply leave
and forget.
Hideki she really does
sound like our mother.
Don't talk like that!
I am not your mother.
Did you find your brother?
I know you don't have one.
I saw the picture.
And now you thinkyou've captured
someone who looks like your mom.
Mama-freak?
Or split personality?
Either way you're crazy!
For a reporter you have
a surprisingly good imagination.
But you've lost touch with reality.
A killer isn't going to
talk to me like that!
Let me see your face!
Now remove the mask.
And now what?
We're going to the police.
The police?
You better do what I say.
I'll shoot.
I'm sure you'd like to shoot me.
If you have the guts to do it...
then shoot me.
Just end the whole thing.
It's already over anyway.
How can you be sure
I won't shoot you?
I don't care if you shoot me.
I'm sick of this.
I knew it wouldn't last forever.
I don't care if it all ends today.
Who do you thinkyou are?
You're mad because
we killed your friends but...
I never had any friends
in the first place.
We lived this way-- Hideki and I--
for a long time.
And now?
We're going to the police.
I doubt it.
Let's go.
Nami!
Get out! Quickly!
Tell me.
What's going on?
Stop it Hideki.
I won't let go.
Who's that?
What is that voice?
Who is it?
Who the hell was talking?
Pull the trigger and shoot me.
End it all! Shoot!
Shoot me again.
Please kill me.
Shoot me in the heart.
No!
Idiot.
Hideki it's happening!
I lost control.
Too strong.
Hideki.
Where are you going?
Hideki.
This is--
You killed my brother!
- You took my brother from me!
- No!
Liar!
Nami.
It started... with me.
And it will end...
with me.
I wanted... to meet you.
Now it's over.
Hideki.
You said...
you wanted it to end.
You are mine now.
Ah so you're finally awake.
We don't know where he went--
the burnt one.
And... the other one?
You mean Hideki?
Yes Hideki.
What happened to him?
We searched everywhere for him.
But it's nothing like...
you told us earlier.
But I really saw him.
He was there.
You said he was a baby
about this size-- a newborn.
Isn't that right?
We checked it out
looked everywhere in the factory.
Plus we disinfected
the burnt body.
But there was no baby.
Perhaps it doesn't really exist.
You told us... it was a monster.
We'd ratheryou didn't say
any of those things to the public.
And we won't mention it
in the official report.
Well I hope you're
feeling better soon.
You'll be back to work
in no time.
The people who died were:
My sound engineer
Masak.o Abe.
My mak.eup girl
Rei Sugiura.
Scripter Rya Kawamura.
Our assistant director
Kondou Ak.io.
They were my behind-the-scenes
personnel. I'll miss them.
T o those of you
who can't sleep...
this is " Late Ni ght With Nami."
Good ni ght.
Good show!
Good job!
Great show.
Excuse me.
During the show
someone dropped this off foryou.
What is it?
He said it was
something you lost.
- Thankyou.
- All right.
Mama!
