Hi, Johnny.
Did you see that?
I got the shot! I got the shot!
Bye, Papa.
See you tomorrow.
Hey, guys. Let's do this!
Whoo!
- Hey, Kitty.
- Hey.
I just had a dream about you.
I bet you did, Johnny-boy.
Come on, let's get a move on.
Hop in the back.
Johnny, be useful and get me
a Frosty from
the cooler back there.
Um, I'm obviously gonna be
filming this whole trip, dude.
It's okay, Zeke.
You can just film me. Thank you.
Kitty.
This is Kitty Akin, America.
She is
the hottest ticket in town
and the probable star of my upcoming film,
Zombies vs. Werewolves
vs. Ninjas vs. Vampires vs.
Robots vs. Dinosaurs vs. Samurai.
Okay, so the dinosaurs is
coming before the samurai?
That is the final decision?
I don't know how it's
going to end up, really.
Sure. Sure, yeah.
We want to please them.
And cut. Kitty, you know,
why are you still with this guy?
Why don't you ditch him 
and get with me, okay? I'll make you a star.
Take you right
to the top, lady.
Um, I think I'm
gonna stick with Matt.
Come to State, Kit.
We can room together.
How about I transfer to State
and then you and I room together?
What do you think about that?
Um, you're not my type, Zeke.
I can change. I'm not
committed to any of this.
This is all really up
for grabs, seriously.
Seriously. I mean, no,
you're gonna be hanging with
all the film geek
girls soon enough.
Trust me. You're gonna be
crawling with your type.
Actually?
Is that, like, a fact?
Yeah.
It's finally gonna happen.
Zeke's gonna get laid!
Oh, Zeke's gonna get laid!
Gonna get laid!
Zeke's gonna get laid!
Zeke's gonna get laid!
Zeke's gonna get laid!
Zeke's gonna get laid!
Zeke's gonna get laid!
Stranger things have happened,
so we don't have to treat that like a joke.
I might actually be offended.
Oh, watch out!
Dude! Simon, man!
Eyes on the road, man.
That was uncool, Simon.
Sorry. I'm sorry.
Eyes on the ball
at all times, bro.
Yeah. Thanks, man.
I don't need a lecture, okay?
I said I was sorry.
Come on, guys! Quit it!
- Really?
- Quit it!
- Hey, Simon.
- Yeah.
Look, I'm gonna open the gate.
Just keep on going.
- Okay, I'll...
- Wait for me, yeah?
- No, I don't think so.
- All right.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- What?
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.
Are you okay?
Mmm-hmm.
Come on, Simon, let's go!
Here? Ugh!
Finally.
Hey, give me a kiss.
Chill,
dude, it's remote-controlled.
Did you hear that?
There you go.
You got that, Matt?
Yeah.
Go, Debbie Deb.
All right.
Of course,
you'd grab the food, right?
Uh-huh.
She's growing. Growing girl.
I don't see a boat.
Zeke, you've been
so helpful thus far.
Oh, yeah...
I'll get the trunk.
- Oh, will you shut the trunk?
- No problem.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.
Matt McLean, the King
of Beers. Former Class Prez.
All-state fullback.
Took a year off
to find himself.
Found himself working
his dad's old feedlot.
How's that working
out for you, Matt?
- It's a living.
- Oh.
And Simon McLean,
Matt's baby brother.
- Yeah.
- That is all there is
to say about you
that's interesting.
Hey, he's our scholarship boy.
He's doing us proud.
His SAT score's
higher than you can count.
Oh, that's right. Simon,
you got the brainiac scholarship
for University of
I'm Getting Outta Here.
Yeah, that was the one.
That is exactly
where I'm going.
How does it feel
to be out from under
in your entire life?
You're gonna dry up and blow away?
Blow yourself, Zeke.
What if I could, my friend?
What if I could?
Zeke the geek.
I mean, it's not like
you got that scholarship
for being number two
on the wrestling team.
Man, you talk way too much.
Mmm. Thank you.
Debbie Vorhese.
I heard a rumor that you're
into water-sports. Is that true?
- Can I film you doing that
sometime, maybe? -
Not those kind of
water sports, you perv.
Oh, shucks.
All you need to know is,
I can kick your scrawny ass.
Really?
Crew Chief kicks nerd butt?
That's a great headline
for your resume, sister.
- Any way to shut you up?
- No, not really.
Just say the word and
I'll happily do the honors.
Oh, that...That is incriminating.
I have that on camera here.
- Oh, no! Oh, no!
- That's evidence, Simon.
I'm not joking. Jonathan,
tell me about this vessel.
Is it seaworthy?
All right. All right.
Shut it off. Come on.
- Turn it off.
- And cut.
- Ah!
- Yeah!
One, two, three!
Oh, this is heavy!
This is heavy!
Does this actually float?
This actually floats in water?
We just have
to watch it over there.
Guys, let's just
get it to the water.
This is cool, man.
This was your Granddad's?
Yeah.
Then he must've been
tougher than you.
Yeah.
Come on, Johnny.
I'm trying.
Hey, do you
need a personal trainer?
I think so.
Forty-five an hour.
Little weakling, Johnny-boy.
One, two...
Okay.
Um, Johnny, there's no service.
Yeah. Welcome to Black Lake.
This is tragic.
How am I supposed to
tweet about our adventure?
- Kitty...
- Damn it!
I've got something for you.
Would you wear this for me?
You're such a freak, Johnny.
What is it?
Just take it.
I want you to be safe.
What are you talking about?
Just wear it.
Johnny, it's kind of weird.
High school's done, all right.
We're free from what people think.
We're never free from what
people think. You know that.
I just, you know...
Sometimes wish that you...
What?
Look, I just wish...
Johnny, get real.
High school's over.
I'm with Matt now.
Yeah? Is that real?
Hey. Don't make me
regret digging you.
It's cool. I'll just carry
this whole trip on my back.
Big help, big help.
Thanks. Appreciate it.
- Yeah.
- Um...
Hey, I don't know where to put
this right now, but I will wear it.
I'll wear it later when we're, like,
dancing around the fire, okay?
Yeah.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Come on.
I gotta get my bag.
- Johnny.
- Hey.
Mr. Parks. What's up?
Working on my motor.
What about you, Johnny?
Friends. We just
graduated last Friday, so...
Everyone's going off
their separate ways.
It's just
a final get-together.
Your grandpa know you're here?
Um, yeah. I told him
I'd be out for the night.
These people,
friends of yours, Johnny?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure. Sure they are.
Uh-huh. And what are you
planning on doing out here?
Uh, we're just gonna, you know,
cross the lake and then party.
Have some fun.
You know better
than that, Johnny.
Um, yeah.
I won't let
anybody get into the water.
Bad idea even going out on the
lake at all with kids like these.
But what's
the point of us having
access to this
whole place, Mr. Parks?
I mean,
if we're afraid to use it.
You have to show respect,
Johnny.
You have a responsibility.
I do, Mr. Parks,
okay? I completely get it.
Well, you may get it Johnny,
but do your friends get it?
Look, it was a pleasure seeing you,
sir, but I'd better be going, okay.
I'm gonna have to come back
and check on you.
Johnny-boy, let's go party!
Hey, you coming with us?
- Dude, come on. Just go.
- No. Pops, come hang out.
I got sticks.
What you doing over here?
Just filming. You're actually
kind of ruining the shot...
Oh, am I?
I can re-conceptualize.
Do something else.
That's good. That's real...
That's artistic. That's what's
gonna get me big awards.
I mean, what do you wanna look at this for
when you're looking at this?
Uh, nature in its purest beauty vs.
Deb making rat-like faces.
It's good.
No, it's a good tradeoff.
Well, we're about ready to leave
up until December, you know.
What is that?
Oh, dude, it's the wood.
Yeah. Are you ladies gonna
sun yourselves or what?
You've been waiting for that?
Yeah, I've been waiting for it.
Can you tell?
I'm getting a tan.
Ah, okay.
It's time.
For what?
Who's going in first?
Just keep rowing, Matt.
Yeah, right, man.
It's too damn cold.
Do you want me to row?
This is where we
separate the men
from the pussies.
Oh, and this is where we should
separate the women
from their clothes.
Come on, guys. Look, Simon's right.
The water's too cold.
And I'm hot.
Oh, this is going viral.
Come on, who's going with me?
Johnny, what part of swim-suit
photo-shoot don't you understand?
Look, we need to get a fire
going on before it gets dark.
Oh, we will.
We will get a fire going!
You're ruining my shot.
Ah!
Come on, man.
Matt, you're really
ruining my shot here.
You guys are too much.
I'll beat you all in.
Ladies, ladies, before you
jump in the water and get wet,
why don't we get
a few more shots of you?
Uh, Kitty,
can I get over the shoulder?
Just a big smile.
Just a gorgeous smile.
Oh, that's gorgeous.
That's gorgeous. We're using that.
Deb, can I get
a quick shot of your butt?
Deb, do it!
- For the sake of art.
- Oh, yeah.
Little more.
Just put the attitude.
Yeah.
Well, I'm an artist, I guess.
There you go. That is beautiful.
Wonderful acting.
- Wonderful acting, man.
- All right, ready?
Set.
Very nice.
Obnoxious, definitely.
It's not cold at all, guys.
Come on.
Dude, it's so nice.
That's it. I'm gonna get you.
You guys,
you got to get in here.
Simon, please, man, I really...
Party time, fellas.
Simon, don't do that, man.
What's the problem, Johnny?
Johnny,
this is your party, okay,
so I'd suggest lightening
up now, a little bit.
Come on. Stop, man.
It's loud.
Johnny opens the cooler,
slyly picks up a beer.
Oh, okay.
Yeah. Okay.
Whoa... Oops!
Well, it's waterproof.
Oh, what was that?
Not cool, Zeke!
Hey,
I didn't do anything, okay.
Not cool!
Or was that you?
Son of a bitch,
son of a bitch, son of a bitch.
- What the hell was that?
- Was that you?
Crap, crap, crap.
Was that you, Zeke?
Zeke,
are you gonna say something?
Ah! Shit!
What's going on,
what's going on?
Come on, man.
What is going on?
Why are those
dudes still on the boat?
Really funny, Matt.
It was a good scene.
Yeah, Johnny almost pissed
his pants. Look at him.
Give me a swig of whiskey,
mattes.
When you guys come out here,
bring Matt back.
Open it for me, would you?
Great.
Guys, you're missing out.
You guys have
the lovely ladies out here.
Mmm.
Ah!
Thank you.
Your brother's sure has that
alpha male thing down,
doesn't he?
Story of my life.
Give me that.
- Yeah. - We really
need to get going, guys.
- You've said that about 15
times already. - SIMON: Shut up.
Oh, yeah, but we
really need to get going.
Sixteen.
You're the goddess of the lake.
Ah, this feels nice.
It's crazy to think about him.
High school's over.
Over.
Yeah, for sure. It's weird.
Do you remember
the time when we were,
like, 15, and we went
to that summer camp?
Of course, D.
I remember it.
God,
seems like a long time ago.
You know, I always think
about that... time we had.
I know.
Everything's so tangled up now.
Yeah.
Yeah!
He came out of nowhere!
Hey, come on!
What?
Come out!
I can't quite hear you.
Okay, whatever. Screw
you, guys. You're missing out.
I got it, I got it.
Don't worry.
We're having such a good time!
Are you ready for this?
Are you ready for this?
Oh, wow, babe.
That was fantastic.
All right,
move over, hot-shot.
Oh, wow!
That's actually very nice.
Okay.
Seven. I'd give it a seven.
9.5. Easy.
Oh, God! What was that?
What?
Oh, crap! No, wait. Something
really just touched my leg!
Just calm down, Kitty.
It could have been anything.
Oh, okay.
Hey!
Kitty!
Come on, Kitty!
Everybody out!
Come back!
Guys, let's get out of here.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Hurry up!
What are you doing? Come on!
Don't look back, just hurry up.
Come on, Kitty.
Come on! We got you.
Come on, hurry up!
I got you.
Where's the other oar?
Look, I'll get the oar.
- Matt!
- Just give me the oar, man.
I got it.
Someone gonna tell
me what's going on?
There's really
something out there.
What did you guys see?
It's back here!
I think it's back here!
Move! Just move!
- Simon, no.
- Do you see it?
Back here, Matt.
Tell me. Come on, speak to me.
There's something out there.
There's this shadow
back here. Come here.
I don't see a damn thing.
See anything?
Okay, where?
Goddamn it!
Johnny, back here!
Back it up!
Come here, come here.
- Do you see it?
- Simon, no.
- Wait... What is it?
- Stop!
Simon, just leave the oar!
Just leave it alone.
Let's just get back to shore.
Will you just let it go?
Can you let go?
God! Just let it go.
What is that thing?
We need that oar.
- Did you see that?
- I almost had the oar.
You guys, we're gonna need it
to get back to shore.
It's okay. It's okay.
Deb, are you okay?
Oh, crap. Crap.
Oh, my God!
Give me your belt.
Hurry up,
we have to stop the bleeding.
Matt, give me your belt.
- Oh, my God.
- We'll tie this up.
Matt, you gotta hurry up.
It's fine, Deb, okay?
Everything's fine.
Matt, tie it up.
You're fine.
Just breathe.
Hold it tight, Matt.
Oh, crap,
it's the brachial artery.
What? What does that mean?
It's not tight enough.
Come on, guys, help out!
Zeke, stop filming!
I'm getting the oar.
Matt, stop rocking the boat.
I'm trying to get the oar.
There's a rope right here.
Matt, come on.
Deb, it's totally fine.
Just breathe.
Yeah, there you go.
Breathe. It's fine.
Okay.
Hey, you're gonna be fine.
Okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay.
You guys, you're gonna
need to get that oar.
I'm trying.
It'll be so much
faster with two.
We're gonna get the oar.
Okay. Hold on.
Okay. Okay, I got it.
Pick it up!
Simon, cool it.
We don't want another accident.
We got to get
back to shore, now.
Guys...
Guys.
- Deb?
- Deb?
Deb! Deb!
This can't be happening!
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Standing here, I was shooting her,
and she was lying there...
She was shaking,
and then she stopped shaking.
Oh, God.
Are you serious?
Are you that
much of a dick, Zeke?
Oh, God, oh, God.
Oh, come on, man.
Damn it!
You have anything, you guys?
Nope.
Keeping it steady
towards shore, bro?
Yes, Matt. We're not,
all right? We're not.
Okay, you want me to take over?
No, I got it!
Oh, my God. What are we
gonna tell her mom?
We'll tell Deb's
mom what happened.
Deb was really brave.
We'll tell her that.
Yeah. Yeah, she was.
She was... But she was.
Right until the end.
Yes, Matt.
I got it, all right?
Just paddle the boat.
If you need me to
do it, I'll do it.
All right. Now,
everyone, it's gonna be okay.
I will not take this.
What are you?
- Whoa, whoa!
- Eat this!
What do you want?
It's turning around.
It's turning around.
It's coming back.
Oh, it's not.
It just went under.
- It's coming back.
- No, no, no. Don't, don't, don't.
- We gotta keep it away from the
boat. - No, don't use the oar!
- It's broken.
- Give me that!
- Give me, give me!
- Get off!
I wanna see it in
that thing's brain!
Simon!
- Whoa!
- Right there, Simon.
- Matt, grab him.
- Someone grab him.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Simon, are you okay?
It was right behind you.
It almost got you.
Look, I got it
stuck in him good. Look.
Okay, so, now, this thing,
it's big, whatever it is.
Oh, man. Oh, man, this sucks.
Turn that thing off, asshole. How
many times do we have to tell you?
I was just trying to
get a reaction shot.
Well, Ahab here used the
last oar to spear the fish.
I had to do
something to slow it down.
It might bleed out and die now.
You got Debbie.
What the hell else do you want?
- Look, it wants blood, right?
- Wow.
Oh, my God, you must have aced Mrs.
Hawke's biology class, dude.
Okay, I'm being serious here.
It didn't attack
until it got a taste.
It's not a shark.
This is a lake. It's fresh water.
Uh, have you seen
the movie Shark Night 3D?
It's exclusively
about sharks in a lake!
Just shut up!
What about you, Johnny?
You've been pretty quiet.
Sucks.
You were freaking out when we
all decided to go swimming.
Is there something about this
lake you're not telling us, hmm?
No.
I don't believe you.
What is this piece
of jewelry you got on?
Simon, cool it.
Tell us what you know, Johnny!
Nothing, man.
Answer, or I'm gonna
throw you overboard.
Look, I didn't think
you'd go swimming, okay?
What are you saying?
Let him go.
I didn't think
you'd all go swimming.
We were just going to
cross the lake and party.
You knew about that
thing in the water?
Look, Kitty.
It was just an old folktale
my grandpa used
to say, all right?
No. No, no, no.
That doesn't add up, Johnny,
because you tried to
give me that necklace
to protect me. So,
obviously, you do believe.
I don't know, Kitty, okay.
I don't know.
Man, you knew about this
and you brought us out here?
You let us go
swimming 30 yards out!
Leave me alone, man, all right?
I didn't want this to happen.
I didn't know it would happen.
And cut.
That was pretty much a confession
as far as I'm concerned.
So let's do a little, you know,
rundown of our
situation right here.
We have zero oars,
we have a hole in
the side of our boat...
Just shut up.
With water
leaking in, and oh, yeah,
there's a giant
flesh-eating fish in the water
that will not let us
get back to shore...
Point, point, point!
- ...unless we distract it with
something! - JOHNNY: Shut up.
Like what?
Like Deb.
I'm suggesting we use Deb
as a distraction in the water.
I think she
would have approved.
- What? No, that's crazy.
- Is it?
- You're nuts.
- Uh-huh.
Her mother's Catholic.
She needs a proper burial.
I went to church
with her as a kid.
You can't do that.
Well, that's
irrelevant right now, Kitty.
Burial at sea is
an honorable way to go.
She'd be aiding
her friends in need.
That's gotta be in
the crew code, right?
Yeah. I think it's the right
thing to do, morally.
Johnny.
I don't know, Kitty.
I mean, we can do
a prayer when we
put her on the side.
When she goes over, we all paddle like hell
till we get to the other side.
She saves the whole team.
Kitty, what do you say?
- - It's okay, Kitty.
It's the right thing to do.
Good call, Kitty.
Let me do this...
Lord, bless our friend,
Deborah Vorhese,
who, uh...
She, uh, gave her life for us,
and we know she's going to a better place
and by Your
eternal wisdom, we, uh,
return her to Your side.
Forever and ever. Amen.
Be ready to paddle.
Come on, paddle! Paddle!
Paddle!
It's working, guys.
All we needed was a diversion.
Oh, my God. I think it's
working, guys. We're gonna make it.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Guys, feeding time's over.
That fish is done.
It went back under.
- Get your hand out.
- What?
We can bail. At least bail.
Johnny, give me
the lid of that cooler there.
Move, Zeke, move!
It's on a hinge, man.
What?
- Here.
- Okay.
All right. Now, everyone bail.
I'm gonna go to the front to paddle. Okay?
All right, all right.
Let me go to the front.
Hey, Zeke, help us, man!
Does anybody see it?
No.
All right, all right.
Keep going. Keep going.
This sucks!
Keep bailing.
Matt, what's your problem?
Paddle!
Matt, paddle!
What is your problem?
Just paddle!
No! No! Are you serious?
Matt.
Are you serious?
Matt, take it easy, okay.
Why is this happening?
That thing is out to get us.
Don't take it personally,
Matt. It's just a fish.
It's one hell of a fish.
No, it's not, dude!
It's just some dumb fish, okay?
The only thing that
thing knows is that
whatever is in the water,
it's gonna eat.
So let's see what else
we have in the cooler.
In the water, not in the boat.
Come on, what do we have?
Let's bail, let's bail.
Okay, everybody lean
to this side, all right?
All right.
Again.
This sucks.
Look, as long as we can see him,
I'm just gonna paddle.
Okay.
Oh, not let that
thing control us!
Okay, let's face it.
The only thing that worked was
when it was
preoccupied with Deb's body,
Well, we don't have any extra dead
bodies on hand, do we, Einstein?
I know that, okay?
So,
what, are you volunteering to
get in the lake to
create a diversion?
- No.
- Okay, then what's your point?
Because I'm the weakest one
and you guys all know that.
I mean, I don't stand a chance
fighting that thing.
Oh, so, maybe someone
more athletic should do it,
like my brother, or me?
No.
Johnny is the one who got us into
this situation. I'm just saying.
Shut up. Just all
of you. Just shut up.
I'm just saying.
But I think we should vote.
Boat's sinking, Kitty.
We're gonna die
if we do nothing.
Or we can save some of us.
We can make some choices.
We vote on one person to...
To volunteer for
the sake of the boat.
Come on, Matt.
Cut it out.
We vote. Now.
And Johnny, since you're the
one who got us into this,
who do you think
should go first?
Go to hell, Matt.
Hey, Zeke,
why don't you volunteer, huh?
Oh. No, wait a second.
No, it was your idea, pal.
This is how this
thing should work, okay.
Each of us
should get to make up,
um, like, a case for ourselves.
A case?
Yes, like, a case for why
we should stay on the boat.
This is insane.
Kitty, I want to live, okay.
I want us to live.
The hell with you, Matt.
No, this is not how we do this.
You know, we stick together!
Don't touch me!
We should be bailing,
or using something else to row.
Johnny,
you should have told us!
You really should have told us!
Stay away from me, Matt!
Kitty!
Okay, Matt, okay, okay.
We vote.
I vote for Zeke.
No, I get to make
my case first, okay?
Okay, this has to be quick.
Two sentences.
Who made you
president of the boat?
All right, two sentences.
Me first.
I'm strong, and you need me
to paddle. All right? Matt?
Yeah, same goes for me. And I'm
stronger than Simon. Johnny?
Great case, Johnny.
I mean, I'm gonna do something with
my life. All you guys know that.
I mean, I'm gonna be
an important filmmaker.
I'm gonna make things
actually matter to people.
I mean, things that might
even change the world,
and I don't mean to be
diminutive to your lives,
but you're not gonna do
anything as important as that.
I mean, you're just not.
You're nice people,
that affect the world like that,
and you all know it.
Somewhere deep down inside,
all of you know that.
That's not two sentences.
Johnny's the one who
got Deb killed. Not me.
Johnny's the one who got us into
this entire situation, not me!
I'm gonna
be a star or a singer.
People need that, you know, to put up
with the crap, to deal with their lives.
Matt, you need that, right?
Simon does, Johnny does.
Right, Johnny?
Yeah.
All right.
That's it.
That's all of us. We vote.
I vote for Zeke.
I go with Johnny.
You? You?
Zeke.
Oh, screw you. I mean, obviously,
I'm gonna vote for Johnny.
Okay,
what do you say, Matt, huh?
One more and Zeke goes,
and that's...
That's what I want,
so just do it.
Johnny's a fighter.
He's got a chance of getting away.
I vote Johnny.
You know, I didn't plan
for this to happen, Matt.
Maybe I should have.
You don't deserve her.
Either of you.
Is that what this is about?
You're a total psycho!
I'll be back for you, Kitty.
All right? You can count on that.
It's like High
school's never over.
You can count on that, Kitty.
I'll be back!
Stop!
Stop! I can't take it.
Johnny! No! Johnny!
Listen, as soon as he
pops up, we're all gonna paddle.
Where...
Oh, my God! Johnny!
Oh, look, look, look.
There it is.
Come on, paddle!
It's going after him.
It's working.
OH, my God! Johnny!
Deb was real.
Johnny was real.
They were not like us.
They were better than us.
Deb got bit by a fish.
End of story. Okay?
Johnny threw himself over like
a damn martyr. End of story.
I'm going to kill you!
You're nothing but a selfish prick!
Oh, well, that wasn't
what you were saying
when you wanted to lead my movie.
Was it, Kitty?
God! You're such an asshole!
Hey!
You guys gotta be kidding!
Talking about movies now?
Zeke, bail!
Kitty, paddle! Come on,
while we still have the chance.
Zeke, if you don't
shut up and paddle
we might still get
out of this alive.
Oh, God, what if...
What if we do make it back to shore?
What are we gonna tell people?
Well, that's is a problem we'd be
lucky to have, okay, sweetheart.
Your pretty
little head about it
and leave
the talking to us men.
You're such an asshole! How can
you keep being such an asshole?
Keep bailing, you idiot!
Now, everyone, come on.
We're all in this together.
Together.
Go team.
I'm sorry, what? What? Hmm?
You voted against me when you
voted Johnny off the boat.
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I thought he had a chance that's
all, unlike this little pussy.
Shut up, Matt!
Kitty what is with you
and Johnny anyways? Huh?
You leading him on?
Got him wrapped
around your little finger?
That is so out of line, Matt...
Both of you! Shut up! Come on!
We need something to fight it.
Anything.
Guys,
there are fireworks in here!
These aren't gonna work.
They're wet.
There are fireworks!
Here. These are good.
These are good.
- Who has a lighter?
- A lighter, a dry lighter?
I do. I do. I do.
- He's back.
- I will not take it!
I'm gonna kill this thing!
Get away.
Light this one.
Light this one.
Yeah, more, Kitty!
More!
I don't...
I think that's it.
Why aren't we getting more?
We need more!
Guys, keep throwing.
Come on.
Come on. I need another one.
There aren't any.
That's all of them.
We're sinking.
We have to do something.
We're not gonna make it this way.
No, no. Don't say that.
We can't quit now, guys.
We gotta,
like, keep on paddling.
Simon?
We need another distraction.
Oh! No, no, no, no.
We just need to stay here.
And something will come up
to save us. Okay?
We're just... We gotta work
together now. This is the time.
That's really rich,
coming from you.
No, I just mean, that...
Guys, it's coming back.
It's coming.
Okay, look just...
What's the point here?
I mean, you saw what it did to
Deb that didn't take long at all.
That wasn't much
of a distraction.
And if you get back to shore?
Right? They're gonna
call you cowards and
you gonna be ruined for
the rest of your lives.
So, let's just drop
this whole conversation.
Your idea in
the first place, jackass.
Zeke can paddle.
Let him paddle!
Hold on!
We're not gonna make it.
We're not gonna...
Okay, let' do it, bro.
It's our only chance! Come on.
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
Matt. Matt, ask her
who else she's been with.
Ask her. Ask her who
else she's been with!
Ask her who she's
been with on this boat!
Ask her!
Not me, okay. I wouldn't
touch the two-timing slut.
- Oh, you wouldn't?
- Hey, shut up!
Ask her who she's been
with on this boat, okay!
You've no...
Ask her! Ask him!
Ask him...
What's he talking about?
He's so full of it.
Zeke's lying!
He's trying to save his ass.
Nothing.
I have evidence of that.
I've film everything.
I got you guys.
All of your
after-school make outs.
In the fieldhouse and in the
stadium. I got all of that.
I heard your little plans.
I have no idea what
he's talking about.
They know what
I'm talking about.
He's lying to save his ass.
Oh, yeah. I'm lying.
I'm lying.
You're right. I'm lying.
It's not like, I can't
backup my story in any way.
Oh, wait a second.
I've film everything!
I got it, right here, Matt.
I got all your little cup-cups after school.
I got you in the fieldhouse.
And at the stadium, I heard
your plans, I heard you talking.
I've no idea
what he's talking about.
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.
I was up there in
the announcer's booth...
You die.
I vote Zeke.
Let's do this, bro.
No! Kitty! Kitty!
Kitty!
Throw, Kitty, off the boat!
It should be Kitty!
Kitty's useless.
She paddles like a girl.
And she's cheating on
you with your brother.
That's a valid point.
Thank you.
Kitty,
you've to pull your weight.
Yeah. Yeah.
But Zeke, Zeke-ster.
Sorry, you're an irritation.
You always have been.
You kind of brought in...
No. Matt, no.
Talking that way about, Kitty.
- You can't...
- Matt, no.
No, Matt. No.
Let's do it.
I vote Zeke.
Zeke.
Kitty.
Kitty, vote for one of them.
- Don't vote for me.
- Decide.
Kitty, vote!
It'll be a stalemate,
we don't have to
throw anyone off.
It didn't work.
- Majority. - We don't
need to vote for anybody.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I vote.
No, no, no. No!
No!
No! No!
No!
Simon!
Matt!
Matt, they fooled you. Matt!
They fooled you, Matt!
They fooled you, Matt!
How does it feel?
They fooled you.
Row, you heroes.
Row! Row for your life!
Where are you?
Where are you, you bitch!
I'm watching!
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Oh, my God!
Paddle!
Kitty, come on. Paddle.
No, no.
Oh, God, make it stop!
- Paddle, please.
- It's crazy.
Paddle!
No, I can't.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Shut up!
Matt, I'm your girl.
She's your girl, Matt.
Man, are you really gonna
listen to that weasel?
I don't know. Should I?
I'm your brother, man.
Yeah.
Got to keep bailing.
Can't believe it, huh?
Good old Zeke.
He was my bud,
you know, for a lot of years.
Ever since what, third grade?
He really was pretty
handy with that camera.
I remember he used to
videotape everything.
He used to video the games for
the coach. Post-game interview.
"Zeke's post-game interview."
He said he had wished he had a
camera implanted in his eyeball.
You know,
he was a pain in the ass, but
maybe he was gonna
amount to something.
You know, maybe
he was gonna do something.
Bro, I know it hurts,
but we did what we had to do.
Yeah.
This day kinda sucks, huh?
Yeah.
Stop it. Stop.
Yup. You know what,
Kitty? You're right.
Pity party's over.
Yeah.
You checked all
the stuff here? Hmm?
Anything we don't
need is going over.
Sorry, Kitty.
Hey, whose bag is this?
Guess it's Johnny's.
What is that? A rubber?
Wishful thinking.
- Look at this. Huh?
- Nice.
Yeah, that thing comes back now
I'm gonna hack it to pieces.
I'd love to take
a good swipe at it.
That's right.
Filet that thing and eat it.
Simon, bail.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Ninja.
I'm gonna paddle with this.
Matt, we gotta do something,
we got to get out of here.
No. No!
No! Get off! Get off!
Let it go.
Simon!
Damn it, Simon.
Sorry.
No, no, no, no, no.
Die! Die, you son of a bitch!
Whoa! That Kitty
is something, isn't she?
That's Kitty.
Whoo! That's Kitty.
You kicked it's ass!
You kicked that thing's ass.
That was bad ass, baby. Huh?
What?
We still have to get
back to shore. It's...
It's so far.
It will be dark soon. Oh, God.
Wait a minute.
Is that a boat?
Oh, my God.
It's a boat.
There's a boat coming!
Hey! Hey!
God, please. Please.
Oh!
That's Johnny.
He's coming to save me.
He said he would come back for me.
He's coming for me.
I'm here, Johnny.
Right here, Johnny.
Johnny-boy!
Pull her around, Johnny.
Glad you came back, Johnny.
What's the plan, hero?
I'll tow you in.
Oh, come on. Is that right?
Why don't you just let us in
the boat with you instead?
You don't wanna
tow this thing in.
Because you voted me off, Matt.
Why wouldn't you
do it again, man?
Johnny, listen, man.
We were just trying to
protect the group. That's all.
I knew you'd make it back safe
and you're here, yes?
Look, I'll tow you in.
All right? You gonna take it?
Please, Johnny, I just... I want
to get off this boat. Please?
Just get him close enough
and I think we can take him.
Come on.
What's it gonna be, slick?
Are you gonna come pick us up?
Come get your girl?
Look at her,
man, she is in distress.
Look, you want to tow.
I'll throw the rope. All right?
Otherwise,
Simon, I can go get help.
But you know that might take
a little bit more time, man.
Okay, okay.
Okay, that's cool.
Sticking to your guns? That's
cool, Johnny. I respect that.
Toss the rope, then. Come on.
Toss it Johnny-boy!
Toss the rope.
Come on, toss it, Johnny-boy.
It's cool. He's gonna do it.
Right, Johnny?
Toss it, Johnny-boy.
It's cool.
He's gonna do it. Right, Johnny?
Please, please, Johnny.
Let's just go.
We all do the right thing,
maybe we'll get out of this alive.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you, Johnny.
That's right.
Come on.
Hurry up!
Come on, man.
Pick it up. Quick, quick.
Get it. Get it. Get it.
All right.
Tie this up. Tie this up.
- Got it?
- Got it.
Don't worry, we're too heavy.
He'll have to take us on board
when he figures that out.
Nice, Johnny.
Oh, my...
Oh, my God. His neck!
Cut the rope! Cut the rope!
We'll lose the motor boat.
- He's choking, God damn!
- No!
You cut that
rope I'll kill you.
Oh, my God! Johnny!
Matt, get off!
Don't let her cut down!
Don't let her cut down!
She won't do it.
That's what I love about Kitty.
Always out for number one.
Huh?
- Shut up.
- Tough as nails.
I got that, Kitty.
Kitty, get out of the way.
Get to the back.
We're so close.
Ah. We're close.
Come on.
Get up there and grab it.
- Damn it!
- No!
Come on!
Come on!
No. No!
Are you kidding me!
Unbelievable!
All right, here it comes.
Coming for Johnny.
- Everyone ready? Huh?
- Yeah.
Anyone ready to quit?
Okay, okay, yeah.
Which way are we going?
We gonna go forward.
What? What is it doing?
What, it's just
gonna leave him there?
What?
What?
No.
It's working.
Nice. Nice.
All right. Let's bail.
"They fooled you."
That's what Zeke said.
You remember Zeke, right?
Seems like an eternity
since Zeke was here,
telling me things
I shouldn't hear.
That side looks closer.
Are we even
paddling in
the right direction?
It's a lake. Every
direction leads to the shore.
Not if we're
going in circles, genius.
So what did
happen in the fieldhouse?
Answer me.
Damn it, Matt!
Zeke was your buddy, right?
Yeah. You were the big guy who
didn't treat him like a dog turd.
He was loyal to you.
If he found out something
he could use against me,
why wouldn't he have told you?
If he had like
a video or something.
But there was nothing, he was
just making it up to save his ass
when he thought we
were all turning on him.
Well, I don't know, Kitty.
Maybe, Zeke didn't tell me
'cause he knew it would
piss me off, you know?
Matt, don't do this. Not now.
Maybe Simon will tell me.
How about it, baby brother?
What happened in
the fieldhouse?
Oh, God.
Matt, it's coming back.
What happened, Simon?
Matt, it's coming back.
I am not rowing
until I know what's going on here.
Who my teammates are.
How 'bout it, Bro?
Matt, this is really not
the time to talk about this.
Okay.
Oh, I'll take that as a yes.
Matt, do you not get it?
That thing is coming.
It's coming back.
We need to paddle.
Matt, I say we vote.
One last vote.
Matt, you and me can swim
to that shore easy
if the fish is distracted.
Anything that happened,
Matt, it doesn't matter.
I made a choice.
I was staying with you.
I'll never leave now.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I did it.
But I will never leave now! Never!
Wasn't just
the fieldhouse, Matt.
No.
Kitty could get pretty randy.
Hey!
Enough!
You wanna vote, Simon?
I vote you.
What you did.
I vote for you.
Get off me!
Get off, you tool!
Shut up, asshole!
She was coming with me, Matt!
Matt, she was coming with me!
No, Matt. Stop
listening to him. He's lying.
She wasn't gonna
stay with you, Matt.
God, you two need to stop it!
You're going to tip us over.
We're gonna tip over.
Stop it, now!
Stop!
What the hell, Matt?
Yeah, I don't know.
What? You gonna
kill me over some slut?
Yeah. I don't know.
Look at her, man.
Look at her.
She's playing
you like a fiddle.
She came to me.
When I got my scholarship.
She thought you were
her ticket out of here
and then she
realized it was me.
She's a bitch, man.
Matt, don't listen to him. Whatever
he says, just don't listen to him.
He's a vicious asshole.
You haven't seen it, but, I have.
I've seen things
that he's done.
I vote Kitty.
Me, too.
Matt.
That's it?
So, what's it
gonna be, Kitty-cat?
You gonna make this easy?
Go for a little swim?
Or you want to do
it the hard way?
Huh? Huh?
What's it gonna be, Kitty?
What's it gonna be?
You know, that's...
It is what I like about you, Simon.
That animal part of you.
Every goddamn time your brother
was inside me,
I wanted it to be you.
- You got the animal part right.
- Okay.
You cheating whore!
No! No!
Ow! Please,
Simon. Please, Simon. Please.
You're done, Kitty.
Where did she go?
I don't know.
Should we swim for it?
We paddle.
We're making progress.
I mean,
we don't even know if that
bitch is gonna
create a distraction...
Shut up!
What's the matter, Matty-Matt?
Huh?
- You got remorse?
- Shut up!
Okay.
I'm sorry. All right.
Oh, man, my head!
Stop!
Ow!
Matt, stop it! Hey!
Simon!
Simon!
Simon!
Don't stop!
Don't stop your legs.
I got you. I got you.
I swear to God I can see
headlights on the shore.
There's someone there
and they're gonna help us.
All we gotta do is
just get to shore.
Matt.
Can you swim, bro?
What? What?
Come on. Can you swim, bro?
- What?
- I'm pretty beat.
- What?
- I'm pretty beat.
Come on. Come on.
Help!
Help.
Final vote.
Oh, my God.
It's all make-believe,
isn't it?
It's all make-believe,
isn't it?
Kitty! Wait!
No, no... No.
You killed Matt.
Wait! Wait!
You killed Matt. I saw you.
I saw you kill Matt.
How did you make it?
You killed your own brother.
Did Johnny plan all this?
You're crazy.
Please. Please,
Simon. Please, let me go.
No one ever
understood me like you did.
I do. I do understand you.
But in the end,
you picked Matt.
No,
Simon, we could be together.
We could be...
We could be so good together.
Together.
It's the story of my life.
Never. Never. Never!
You will never
leave this place.
- Are you...
- Johnny's friend.
Yeah, from before.
Where's Johnny?
Uh...
Sir, there's been
a terrible accident.
That boy, he was very kind.
Like his grandpa.
I've known his
grandpa all my life.
Sir, you have no idea what
happened. The nightmare.
My brother and
my friends are...
Sir, I tried to save
them and I couldn't.
Oh, is that what happened?
Sir, there is a monster.
There is a giant fish.
I heard about it when I was a kid,
but nobody believed it.
You kids,
you don't believe anything anymore.
Sir, I don't think you understand
what I've been through.
Oh, yeah, I do.
I've been watching you.
How did you find that?
Washed up on the shore.
Like so many things
better left in the lake.
Whatever's on that camera
does not tell the whole story.
Oh, you're such a big shot,
you and your brother.
Your father
practically owns the town.
I guess you thought you
could get away with anything.
Sir, you have... You have no
idea what you're talking about.
Sir, I need to get help.
I guess you thought this
would be the end of it.
What are you doing?
Don't move.
What is going on?
What the hell are you doing?
I don't think the lake is
finished with you yet, son.
Sir, please. Please stop.
Please stop.
Maybe you'd better move back into
the water and try your luck again.
No, no. No! I am not
going back out there.
No! No!
Ah!
Ah!
Stop. Please, stop.
Please stop!
No! No!
No! No! No! No! No! No!
No!
No. No! No!
No! No!
