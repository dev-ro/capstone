I'm late.
Mr Chen, good of you to rush back.
Where is everybody?
They've all gone to the funeral.
Take along an umbrella.
Teacher!
Chen!
Teacher's beyond hearing.
Chen!
What's the matter with you?
Take him back for a rest.
Have some porridge!
You haven't eaten in two days.
Teacher's dead. I know how you feel
But it hurts me to see you like this.
Please, eat something.
He still refuses to eat?
Talk to him.
Why won't you eat?
We all feel sad over his death
but we must live on.
Can ulcers kill a man?
He had ulcers but died of pneumonia.
Can that kill a man?
How did he die?
The doctor said he died of pneumonia.
I don't believe it.
He was in perfect health.
Something must have happened.
Calm yourself.
We've all been thinking about it.
But we mustn't be rash.
We're investigating quietly.
I must find out the truth.
Of course. It's our duty too.
Many will come
to pay their respects tomorrow.
You must stay calm. Get some rest.
Ho Yuan chia was a great instructor.
He was a champion of the weak.
Everyone knows that.
I've known him for 30 years.
I admire him for founding Ching Wu school.
He travelled all over the country
using up all his money and energy.
He even sacrificed his life.
I remember what he used to say:
He founded Ching Wu School
to strengthen body and mind
not to win over others.
He was against conflict among schools.
He hoped all of us would be of one heart,
to be strong and love the country.
We must remember his words
and develop martial arts accordingly.
So that every Chinese will be strong
to serve the community and the country
as well as the future generations.
He died too soon after Ching Wu School began.
He contributed so much to martial arts.
We have lost a great man.
Our respects to Master Ho!
Let us have 3 minutes' silence.
Please sign in.
We're just in time.
You're...?
I'm the interpreter
for Hung Kiu School's Mr. Hu
I've brought something for you.
What is it?
Chief Ling Mu Kuan sent me.
Sick Man of East Asia!
What do you mean by that?
It's very simple.
We know you're training here.
The name is a gift from our master.
Are you Chinese?
Yes, but I'm different from you.
Calm down. I wouldn't be here if I were scared.
I know you are all here.
I've come to challenge you.
Well? Who'll step out?
Chia Chi
Step back!
My friends here are eager for a duel.
Who will satisfy them?
You have trained hard
but now you dare not speak out.
What's happened to your courage?
Hold it, you're...?
I'm Hu, the interpreter.
Our teacher told us
to train for physical fitness
but not for fights.
Our school won't fight you.
Then you're conceding defeat.
If anyone can defeat me,
I'll eat those words
Listen to my Japanese friends.
They've issued a challenge.
Well? Anyone care to try?
If the Ching Wu people won't fight
how about the other schools?
Well? You want to...
Don't be mad, kid
You're all useless sick men of Asia
Chen, stay calm.
Why won't you speak up?
You can all attack together.
We shall always oblige.
It's too much, too much!
Why won't you let us fight?
I wanted to fight too
but Teacher told us not to get in trouble.
Who do you want?
Your chief, Hiroshi Suzuki
He's not here. What is it?
I have something to return to him
Punk, you got a nerve.
I'm the worst of Ching Wu students.
I want to try your Japanese martial arts.
You must be tired of living!
One on one? Or all together?
I alone will be enough.
Let me.
Surround him
Hold it!
We Chinese aren't sick men
Eat
You eat paper this time. Next, it'll be glass.
What is it? You're crazy!
It is here!
Ching Wu punks dare come here!
What's his name?
I know him, Master
He's Chen, Ho's favorite
Let me ask you this.
Can bushido people
take this lying down?
Bushido people won't!
Right
No! Bushido is the world's best.
Now tell me what to do
We must take revenge!
Right, revenge!
Destroy Ching Wu School.
Don't come back if you fail.
Yes. Go...
What is it?
Go in and take a look.
No.
Look.
Where's the dog?
It belongs to a foreigner.
Come here!
Don't you want to get in?
Act like a dog and I'll get you in.
Hurry, the police are coming!
What do you want?
You attacked without warning.
What's the purpose?
Why all this rough stuff?
Take that down
Don't fight, stop fighting
Don't insult our teacher.
Stop!
Right, let's go!
That's only a little warning.
Hand over Chen in three days
or we'll shut you down
and you'll all be arrested.
Brother!
Come and help
Teacher, if you were alive
we wouldn't be bullied like this.
He wants us to hand over Chen.
His rashness got us into trouble.
Don't blame him.
Don't blame it on him.
He's back.
Elder brother.
You got us into trouble.
Where have you been all day?
Did you go to Hung Kiu School?
You wanted to be a hero but
look what's happened to us
Why didn't you tell us?
I'm asking you.
We build body, spirit and patriotism
but not to fight and make trouble.
Then why didn't you tell us?
Many Japanese came and beat us up.
They asked us to hand you over
in three days
What shall we do?
Let him finish what he started.
How can you say that?
What then? Wait to be closed down?
Not only that, we'll all be arrested.
Think! We must not deliver him to them
and we must protect ourselves too.
We can't surrender him
or he'll be killed for sure.
There's only one way. Leave Shanghai.
Right. You must leave Shanghai.
I'm not going.
Why not?
I don't want to get you into trouble.
We all understand.
You must think of yourself too.
I'm not leaving.
You'd better leave.
As long as they can't find you,
even with the Japanese influence,
they can't do anything without proof.
I didn't mean what I just said.
We're brothers. I can't let you die.
You don't want to leave now
Do you think staying is a brave thing?
None of us are afraid of trouble.
Why don't you listen to our advise?
Go, we won't blame you.
Have you forgotten
what Teacher always said?
You know the principle of our school.
His death increases our burden.
Think of the school if not yourself.
Why sacrifice needlessly?
As your elder I order you to go.
Buy him a train ticket for tomorrow.
It's late, you'd better sleep.
Is everything packed?
Yes.
I came back to marry you
but look what's happened.
I don't care much for ceremony.
We can return to Shanghai some other day.
We can have great fun then.
Friends suffer because of me.
Nobody is blaming you.
You're on the first train. Go to sleep.
I must stay with Teacher tonight.
You go to sleep first.
Did anyone see you?
No. They're all asleep.
Got it?
Yes. Mr. Wu told us to get away.
If they found out Ho died of this
we'd be in deep trouble.
Why does Mr. Wu want us to leave?
He said the job's done.
There's no point tarrying
What should we do?
You're returning home tomorrow.
I'll resign, and we'll go together.
You're Japanese?
Yes, I came to kill Ho Yuan chia.
How could you say such words?
Why not?
I'm not afraid of your Fist of Fury.
You're Ho's favorite pupil.
I must test your mettle.
Feng, come out here.
Why did you kill Teacher?
Why?
Why did you kill Teacher?
"Teacher was killed by poison
in the biscuit"
"I'm going to find the killer
and take revenge."
Captain! Captain!
Captain! Where is Big Brother?
What's it?
What's going go? Where is Big Brother?
I just saw two men hung on a lamppost.
I saw it myself. They're out there.
What is it?
I just bought my train ticket.
I saw two men hung on a lamppost
They are Feng and cook Tien.
Are you sure?
Yes, Feng and the cook.
There's absolutely no mistake.
Let's go and have a look.
What is it?
Feng and Tien are in trouble.
It is Feng!
Let's go back and discuss things.
Get transportation.
The two men's faces were all cut up.
Who could it be?
Will our Ching Wu School be involved?
No, since we don't know who did it.
Not really
But they belonged to the school.
So what? We didn't kill them.
Here's International Settlement.
I see troubles ahead.
We must find the killer.
Chen did it.
- Chen? - Who else?
He left a note for me, saying
Teacher died of poisoning.
I wonder where he could have gone.
Hiding doesn't help.
He always acts as he pleases.
Why didn't he tell us?
We must find him.
How? Shanghai is so big.
He does not know Shanghai well.
Organize a search!
We must find him out
We'll settle this when he returns.
Who's there?
It's me!
I thought you'd be here.
Hiding is useless. Come and discuss it.
I won't go back.
No one knows your role in this yet.
Why hide and suffer?
Let's go back and find a way.
I'm not hiding. I don't want you involved.
What are you going to do then?
I've made my plans.
What are you going to do then?
Why won't you tell me then?
We grew up together.
We've confded in each other.
Why have you changed?
I haven't changed.
Then why won't you tell me?
You must know how concerned I am.
I love you as much as ever.
I believe you.
Then don't ask questions.
Remember the many plans we had?
I do.
We hoped to continue Teacher's cause
and to have a happy family.
Two kids, a boy and a girl.
Every day you'd teach kung fu
and I'd do the housework.
I'd come and fetch you
and bring the kids home from school.
Can such a dream come true?
I hope so.
If you haven't changed, this may happen.
You mustn't think that way.
Do you really love me so much?
Besides Teacher, you mean most to me.
Really?
Will you tell me your plans now?
Why won't you speak?
Trust me. I'll take you away.
Where to?
A place where our dreams will come true.
Do you know anyone called Hu?
Hu?
He's connected with Teacher's death
Wasn't that interpreter named Hu?
Could he be the one?
Something terrible has happened!
Come in.
What is it?
Look at the papers. Mr. Yoshida's brother
and Feng are dead, they've been strung up
I know. Sit down.
Yes.
My brother became Ching Wu School's cook
to find about the Fist of Fury.
Now he's been killed.
You must avenge him, Master.
Of course. They killed him.
We'll kill them all!
I'll assemble the men.
Wait! If we do that
it'll connect us to Ho's death.
What do you mean?
I have an idea.
Let's hear it.
We'll pressure the police
to force them to hand over Chen.
Or close the school and arrest everyone.
Chinese are very loyalty
Chen won't let that happen.
He'll surrender himself.
When we have Chen
we can do whatever we want with him.
He'll be helpless.
How does that sound?
You're Japan's best friend.
I've always been loyal to the Empire.
I'll do my best until I die.
Go ahead with it immediately.
Yes.
Out of respect to your Teacher,
we've been lenient with you people.
But you are causing trouble.
Why did you raid Hung Kiu School?
We haven't made any trouble for you.
They came and beat us all up.
We didn't start anything.
You must have provoked them.
Had they not brought this first...
And...
How did Feng and Tien die?
Do you know?
We don't know.
You really don't know?
We don't know.
This isn't as simple as it looks.
The Japanese are powerful here.
You're asking for trouble.
I've been kind to you.
But I have my duty to perform.
Where is Chen?
He hasn't returned.
Know where he is?
No. We're looking for him too.
You shouldn't withhold information.
I am not a patient man.
We don't know. We're looking for him.
We don't want to be involved.
The Japanese Consulate has demanded action.
This is no joke.
Hand him over in two days
or I'll have to be tough.
Let's go!
Japan is great!
Even its dancing is superb.
Now I'm escape from Russia. Im your man
Don't worry, leave things to me.
Get out? What happened?
Mr. Petrov is head of the Russian Hampers.
A good fighter and a friend of our master.
He's in some trouble and is laying low here.
Under our master's wings
you're safe. Drink, Mr. Petrov.
Three cups? OK.
Three? All right. Three cups.
I'm drunk. Excuse me.
No, three more cups.
Wait, come back.
Sit down.
If you must go, then crawl out!
Crawl?
Well?
Sure. I'll do whatever you ask.
I'll crawl.
Bye!
Stand up.
Where to?
North Szechuan Road, Yokohama Road
Stop, where are you going?
This is a dead end.
What are you doing?
I want to ask you something.
It's you!
I want to ask you something.
You needn't ask. I know nothing.
I want to ask you something.
I know what you want. I didn't do it.
Yes, someone asked me to do it.
Mr. Suzuki told me to pass the poison
to Feng.
Feng gave it to Tien, he's Japanese.
Spare me. I am just a dog.
Have mercy.
Why do you pick on me?
Look another man hanged!
Come and look!
Chen first invaded our school
and now killed our interpreter.
He don't give face to our Empire
Is there justice in this place?
Are you detectives any use at all?
Sir! Surely you overstate things.
I give them two days to deliver Chen.
I know what to do if they don't.
What can you do? You're Chinese.
You help your own kind.
I don't care about nationality.
The police has to be reasonable.
I have no intention of being reasonable.
Chen is a killer. Find him.
You can say that, sir
but this is not our procedure.
Hu was murdered but there's no proof.
We can't say Chen did it.
Proof or not proof
I want him!
Or I'll report you to the consulate!
You're making it difficult for us.
Then I'll handle this myself.
I have ways of handing this.
All right, I'll do my best
They're gone. They won't get anywhere.
Chinese are Chinese, after all.
We'll report to the consulate first.
The papers...
They're forcing me to deliver Chen.
How can I find him in this big city?
Forget it.
We'll go to Ching Wu School.
Things are getting worse.
Chen has killed the Japanese interpreter.
He's taking us on too.
What would you do in my place?
We really can't find him.
What are we to do?
Everyone knows you're a fair man.
We wouldn't dare lie to you.
We don't know where he's hiding.
We've looked all around.
You must hand him out
You know the Japanese can be tough.
If they close down your school
and arrest you
you'll find it really tough.
Even if you arrest us now,
we still can't tell you what we don't know.
I've made things clear anyway.
There's one more day left.
Please hand him out
The Japanese aren't kids.
Don't blame me for taking you in.
It's really serious.
What are we to do?
Let's stop looking for Chen.
If we find him, we're sending him to his death.
They won't dare touch us.
So many are suffering because of him.
Let's go to jail if we must.
Captain!
I want to talk to you.
What is it?
If they really can't find Chen
will it cause the school much trouble?
Yes, the Japanese are influential in Shanghai
They may well close down the school.
What if they found Chen?
He'll surely be killed.
How can we let them found him out?
I wonder where he's hiding.
We must find him and tell him to escape.
I...
You what?
You know where he is?
It is a matter of life or death.
If you know, tell me.
I know where he is at night.
Where is he now?
I'm from the telephone company.
What took you so long?
I just got my orders.
Come with me!
There
Don't just stand there, hurry up!
There's another one inside.
Wait here.
The telephone man is here.
Master, it's the telephone man.
Come in!
Tell him to come in.
Come here.
Chief, it's the telephone man.
Go on.
I am dying to find Chen
and see just how good he is.
It's not only his Fist of Fury.
He moves like lightning.
We'll concentrate on Ching Wu School.
Wait!
Ok.
What do you suggest?
Just wipe everyone out.
How about the consequences?
We're the International Settlement.
As long as we leave no evidence
nobody can prove a thing.
Send someone tonight, do a clean job.
Yes, sir!
Why isn't he here?
Look around.
Chen...
I wonder where he could have gone?
Let's wait for him.
Where could he be?
I wonder...
Won ton noodle
I'm here to avenge my teacher.
It's none of your business. Get out!
Get out!
Scram!
Hold it! Who are you?
I'm Chen. I want your master.
Chen?
Let me take care of him.
Li-erh!
Yao Chang!
What happened? Who did it?
The Japanese.
What about the others?
Any survivors?
Everyone...
Yao Chang!
He might yet pull through.
Help those who have a chance.
We'll go upstairs and see
if there are any survivors.
None, Captain.
I'm unworthy of Teacher!
They died so horribly.
What are we going to do?
Our inaction was a mistake.
Chen was right.
The Japanese.
I'm from the consulate.
How dare you kill at the judo hall?
It's really too much!
I don't want this to get out of hand.
I'll hand over the man to you.
You're Chinese. I don't trust you.
I must go in.
All right, just you.
Keep guard here. Admit no one.
What's up?
The Japanese did it.
The Japanese?
Watch your tongue.
You must not slander people.
What proof do you have?
These two survivors.
If I wasn't in charge of Ching Wu School,
if not for Ching Wu School's future
I'd fight you to the end.
Stop talking. Go ahead and file a complaint.
I only want Chen immediately.
He killed many people in Hung Kiu School.
The consulate has asked the police for him.
You'll have to hand over Chen.
What?
They killed so many of us but they're free.
And nobody knows if Chen
was the killer at Hung Kiu School.
Now you want us to hand him over.
Is that fair?
We didn't rise to the occasion.
You know the situation here.
Chen must be delivered!
I don't know where he is.
You call the shots.
Right. Take them away!
You really don't know where he is?
What if we can't find Chen?
I've been kind to you
now I cannot help you any longer.
You're taking us all in?
Not only will you go to prison,
the school will be closed too.
Ching Wu School is finished.
Do you Japanese listen to reason?
Isn't there justice?
I'm the law in Shanghai.
Don't blame me for taking you in.
Blame it on Chen.
Who asked him to go into hiding?
He should surrender for your sake.
Chen is here!
Tell the truth.
No lies. If I surrender
will you spare Ching Wu School?
Well?
I can give you my word of honor.
Don't forget, I'm also Chinese.
I shall pay for the lives I took.
Leave Ching Wu School alone.
"Who says knight errantry is dead?"
"Who says life is always preferred?"
"Here goes a true hero"
"Caring little what lies ahead"
