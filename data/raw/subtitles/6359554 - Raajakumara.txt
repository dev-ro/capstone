- Who do you guys think you are?
- What do you think?
- Sorry, sir.
- This is my country.
- Go away..
- To hell with you.
If you don't leave, you'll
suffer the consequences.
What do we do now?
- Let's call helpline.
- You're right.
Leave me.
Help me, man.
Even I am from Karnataka.
You can talk to me in Kannada.
Are you from Karnataka?
I am from Mangaluru. And you?
Is this the time to
ask for address?
I don't divide cities
and states like you do.
My father taught me country means
India, and state means Karnataka.
Never put a boundary line.
But, if anyone crosses
the boundary..
"Six."
"Appu!"
Appu..
I hope this will
not happen again.
The children from my country shouldn't
have to face this trouble again.
- Yeah..
- Okay, take care.
Respect India..Respect Indians.
Your father has
pampered you too much.
We were waiting at home to
celebrate your birthday.
But you went out to
fight for your country.
Mom, Sachin Tendulkar
came right back..
..to play the World Cup after
his father passed away.
Along with family sentiments..
..one should have commitment
towards the country as well.
Well, if I hurt you, I am sorry.
Happy birthday to you.
Mom, where's your younger
brother Venky, the singer.
He wanted to surprise you..
..that's why he's been practicing
his song since morning.
Where is Venky?
Where is he?
I don't know. He was
here a minute ago.
"I wish you live really long."
"Happy-Happy-Happy
birthday to you."
"Happy birthday to you."
"Happy birthday to
you, Dear Sid."
Appu, this song is
my gift to you.
Just like elders say..
May you live a long life..
Bless you.
May God bless you!
"M..m..m..m.."
"Macho Man..!"
"Macho Man..!"
"M..m..m..m.."
"Macho Man..!"
"Macho Man..!"
"Look at him swoop down
my favorite hero."
"He's so strong he can
shake up anyone."
"He's really cute he's
the king of the world."
"He's the one who
dwells in our hearts."
"His soul is pure, his
heart is heaven."
"He's twinkle-twinkle
little star."
"He's the coolest..everyone's
dearest."
"World's only power star."
"He's unique..
He's one of a kind."
"He's Mr. Perfect."
"The world gives him respect."
"He's Mr. Perfect."

- Well done, son.
- Thanks.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for your wonderful presentation.
It was wonderful meeting you.
This year the twin-tower
project of Melbourne goes to..
Willians and Cort.
Dad, I..
It was an important
project, son.
I thought we'll get it.
It's alright.
Best of luck for next time.
- I am going home, are you coming?
- No, dad. You go.
Hello.
- Hello, Helpline?
- Yes.
This is Nandini. Right
now I am in a problem.
Can you please help me out?
Please.
- It's urgent.
- Where are you?
- Nandini?
- Huh..
- Helpline?
- Yeah..
Actually, I am new to Australia.
I am from Karnataka. Can
you please help me?
Ohh..so you're from Karnataka.
- Yes.
- How can I help you?
You'll have to be my partner.
So soon.
I mean I am a Salsa dancer.
I've applied as a trainer
at the Dance Academy.
The selections are today.
But no Australian is
ready to be my partner.
I am so sorry, I
don't know Salsa.
- I can't help you..
- Please, don't say no.
Can't you do this
much as an Indian?
Please.
I will teach you. Don't worry.
Please..
Please!
Start.
- Hey..
- Yes.
I am selected.
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.
Thank you for the help.
Take care.
- Your name?
- Siddharth.
Bye.
Why are you so late?
I walked all the way home.
- Where's your car?
- Don't know.
Huh..
Siddharth, let's eat.
I am not hungry, mom.
- Brother-in-law.
- Yeah..
He left his car somewhere
and walked home.
He must be worried because
we didn't get that project.
Tension?
Well, we've celebrated even
when he didn't get a project.
What kind of a project was this?
I don't get it.
Appu!
Uncle, should I use a
soap or a shampoo?
Close the door, son.
There are children running
around in the house.
What's wrong with him, God?
- Bye, sister-in-law.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- See you.
- Yeah.
- Good morning, Sid.
- Good morning, dad.
Dad, I really don't feel like
coming to the office today.
It's okay, Sid. Take care.
'He's really upset because
we didn't get the tender.'
'He's taking more interest
in business than me.'
He's been watching
this since morning.
I don't know what kind
of a dance is this?
She lifts her leg,
he lifts his leg.
She sticks to him..then
flies through the air.
Like Gemini Circus.
He's out of focus.
'He's eating while he's dancing.
God, what's wrong with him?'
Dad, why don't you learn Salsa?
It's a very interesting
form of dancing.
Sounds nice, but I
need a partner.
You have mom.
Drink some water.
'If I see these two
doing the Salsa,
it will make me dizzy.'
'I know what's in your heart.'
- Goodnight, dad.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, mom.
- Goodnight.
'I see..so he's more worried about
Salsa, and not the business.
What's wrong?
Dance-master, Acting king..
Everyone thinks you're
behaving like this..
..because you didn't
get the project.
Is the reason that I think it is, Mr.
Perfect.
Hello, you're the only guy
without a controversy.
What is it?
Don't worry, uncle.
I am worried because that our
family might get embarrassed.
- Great.. - Do you know what's
wrong with me? I am in love.
- You're in love.
- Love is everything.
Who is that girl?
What's her name?
Where is she from? Is
she an Indian girl?
I am not giving you any details.
I'll tell you everything
once she says yes.
Until them stop following
me around like the Press.
Fine, then I'll
ask you properly.
Are you learning Salsa
because of her?
Yes, she's a Salsa instructor.
And, I am going to join Salsa
classes from tomorrow.
- Nandini.
- Mom.
- She's a mom.
- Mom?
What is this?
Did you fall for an old
lady instead of a girl?
Hey, my phone.
- Hello.
- Hello, Nandini.
- Yes.
- This is Helpline..Salsa..
- Hey, Siddharth, how are you?
- I am fine.
- But, that kid..
- He's my friend's son.
I see, your friend's son.
Oh, God.
For a minute I thought
he's after some widow.
God saved me.
You can join classes
from tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Is he going to learn
Salsa or fall in love?
Only God knows that.
1..2..1..2..
Hold 2..
1..
Siddharth, come practice.
1..2..1..2..
1..2..1..2..
Spin..
Catch.
Very good Siddharth,
you catch well.
'I joined so that
I can catch you.'
You must practice at home too.
You will learn very fast.
Do you have a partner?
- I can't-do it.
- Lift it up!
- I can't-do it.
- Lift it up!
If I lift my other
leg, I'll be dead.
Hey, uncle, you can't
even do a single step.
What about this paunch
that intervenes?
Then slim down first.
For a man losing weight,
and for a woman..
..gaining weight is
a difficult task.
Uncle, I cannot practice
if depend on you.
I'll do it myself.
There won't be any
classes this week.
I am going on a trip,
with my best friend.
- See you next week, okay.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I thought I'll get through to
her this weekend.But bad luck.
Son, I want to share
something with you.
- Go ahead, dad.
You know, last month
we donated funds..
..to Karnataka
State Education.
This time we'll
donate for Polio.
The karnataka Government
will support us.
He's Mr. Sridhar.
The state Health Minister.
I had a word with him along with
a couple of government officers.
I am also sending
some funds this week.
Great, dead. Very
nice initiative.
Sid, our country has given
me plenty of things.
Education, culture,
and my identity.
We must do something
for our country.
God has given us two hands.
One to protect yourself, and the
other to protect our people.
I am extremely
proud of you, dad.
I feel proud to be your son.
By the way, Sid tomorrow
when you meet them,
..you must meet Harry first.
- And close the deal.
- Okay, dad.
I am sure you can do it.
Check, please.
Oh..so your friend
betrayed you..
..and you had to take
up a job as a waiter..
..because you didn't have money.
You should take some
friendship lessons from me.
Boys get their bones broken
for the sake of friendship.
In fact, they even
dump their lover.
And your friend, she betrayed
you on your first trip.
Fine, I'll book a taxi.
- Go home.
- I won't go back.
I will go with you.
Let's go out, huh.
I want a mobile.
Really?
You're very lucky.
Anything you want eventually
lands in your lap.
- Venky..
- Huh!
- Is that Siddharth?
- Yes.
Ask him whether he ate or not.
He's just getting started.
He will finish soon. Won't you?
Uncle, your problem
is you're a bachelor.
Even a table will look
like a bed to you.
- Don't worry baby..
- Hang up, I'll call you later.
I am absolutely fine. Okay.
Take care, bye.
Where did she go?
We're not husband and
wife to stay together.
She has a separate
room, and so do I?
Listen, you're young..you
should never sleep alone.
A person shouldn't stay
alone after a certain age.
Don't bore me with
your lectures.
Give her your virginity,
not lectures.
Are you two in the same room?
"The moon's young, and
so is the night."
"Don't let our conversation
remain unsaid.."
Seal this deal today, son.
- Uncle.
- What now?
You always get me wrong.
I mean, I will propose to her.
During dinner, I will seal..
Go get her, son.
Hi.
Is everything set?
Did you seal the deal?
- Your looks beautiful.
- Thank you.
- Nandini.
- Excuse me, order, please.
Sure.
Nandini, what I want
to tell you is..
Excuse me.
Whoever invented the mobile
should get a beating.
Nandini, you're always
on the phone, you're..
I am really sorry.
It was my boyfriend's call.
He is very worried.
I came on this trip
without telling him.
That's why he keeps
calling and asking me.
I have a competitor.
My love didn't work out.
Who can compete against you?
No one can compare
himself to you.
You won the National
Award age the age of 10.
There's a big difference between the
flowers on the road and in the shop.
Goodnight.
Thanks for everything.
I thought you'll sleep
in the room last night.
But you slept in the car because
I'll feel uncomfortable.
You're not like others.
First of all, your judgment
about boys is wrong.
According to the girls, the only
perfect man is their father.
Handsome means their son.
The only lucky man is
their brother-in-law.
And the one they trust
is their brother.
And, the rest look
like hooligans to you?
Hi, friends.
This song is dedicated to
only for love failures.
"- When the heart's broken."
- Come Siddharth, join the party.
- No, mom. You guys enjoy.
"- What do I live for?"
Come.
"When the heart's broken."
- Good night, dad.
- Okay, Sid. Take rest.
"When the heart's broken."
"What do I live for?"
"What do I live for?"
Hi, Siddharth.
- Are you free today?
- Boys are not always free..
But they always manage
to spare some time.
- What is it?
- It's my friend's son's birthday.
His mom and dad are busy.
Both are working.
At least, why can't we
celebrate his birthday.
Just a minute, I'll be back.
What is this?
Doesn't your sister have
anything better to do?
She's always talking
to her boyfriend.
What? Boyfriend?
She doesn't have a boyfriend.
But that's what
she always says..
..to save herself from everyone.
A few days ago she
went on a trip..
..where she found a scapegoat.
And, she said the
same thing to him.
- Bujji, are you enjoying?
- Yes.
- Nandini.
- Yeah.
I want to talk to you.
- Are you free this evening?
- Okay, Siddharth.
I am really sorry, Nandini.
I made a big mistake.
Why? What happened?
Even after I knew you
had a boyfriend..
..we kept going out together.
And we were also close.
- I really made a big mistake.
- What?
- It was almost like our honeymoon.
- Siddharth!
Yes, Nandini. Yes!
It's wrong for one guy
to betray the other.
After today it's just
you and your boyfriend.
Bye.
What's wrong with you?
You were behaving
strangely last night too.
15 missed calls.
I feel pity for her.
Imagine my plight when she
said she has a boyfriend.
So this is revenge.
In every love story, it's always
the girl who shows attitude..
..but in this story,
it's the guy.
Instead of playing with her, you should
marry her and play with your kids.
Must be her.
Hey..hey, kid..
It's on.. Talk to her.
- Hello.
- I called you so many times.
- I am busy.
- Spare 10 minutes from your schedule..
..if you don't show up
or answer my calls..
..I'll write your name on my
death note and commit suicide.
I've already lost 5 minutes
of the time I asked you.
The place we're sitting
in the hot-seat.
Honestly speaking, I
don't have a boyfriend.
The person I keep talking
to is my friend Simran.
You're my Mr. Perfect.
I was scared that I might
cross my boundaries.
That's why I maintained
my distance.
I am single.
What can I do if you
don't have a boyfriend?
I love you.
Why don't you say something?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Do you love me?
"I love you"
"She looks only at me..
What's happening?"
"What's happening?"
"What's happening?"
"She's quiet but feels like
she's saying something."
"She's saying something."
"Why does she keep smiling?"
"How did you..become
so beautiful?"
"Now you've become my poem."
"Forgive me for my
small mistakes."
"She looks only at me..
What's happening?"
"What's happening?"
"What's happening?"
"She's quiet but feels like
she's saying something."
"She's saying something."
"Why does she keep smiling?"
'English Rap Song.'
'English Rap Song.'
"I practice our long
conversations for hours."
"I can't remember
anything else."
"I keep sending flowers
to you on whatsapp.."
"..but the feeling over
technology is not enough."
"She staggers whenever
we take a selfie."
"Whenever I get close..she
gets closer to me."
"I know..she's
like touchscreen."
"The world's crazy
about technology."
"I'll never turn off
my phone, pardon me."
"She looks only at me..
What's happening?"
What's happening?"
"What's happening?"
"She's quiet but feels like
she's saying something."
"She's saying something."
"Why does she keep smiling?"
"She's a capricious butterfly."
"Gives me whatever I want."
"I will never leave her alone."
"I can't tolerate any
distance from her."
"We'll be together forever."
"Let's have fun."
"Why does she keep smiling
while having fun?"
"She makes me dance
to her tunes."
"Her smile..drives me crazy."
"She's a magician."
"She's the one that won
my heart, pardon me."
"She looks only at me..
What's happening?"
"What's happening?"
"What's happening?"
"She's quiet but feels like
she's saying something."
"She's saying something."
"Why does she keep smiling?"
Hello, Jagdish. How are you?
I am fine.
- I hope everything is fine at your end.
- Everything is fine.
I've sent the project
details through email.
I'll email you the business details
of the Bangalore project in an hour.
By the way, we're
coming to Australia.
Okay..I called for
a personal matter.
And not business matter.
- It's Ashok.
- Yeah..
I've said this before.
I want your daughter
as my daughter-in-law.
- And that's why I called.
- You see, Ashok..
Don't make excuses.
You're coming here next week.
So bring your daughter along.
We'll fix an engagement date.
- But my daughter..
- Listen.
Don't tell him our
daughter ran away.
Otherwise, he'll get the
wrong impression about us.
- Hello. Hello, Jagdish.
- Yes.
Sorry, Ashok.
- I was on the other line.
- Okay.
Well, prepare for your trip.
- See you in Australia.
- Bye, thank you.
Okay.
How will we face Ashok?
What will we say when he
asks about our daughter?
She looks like a nice girl.
Yes.
Brother, together they are
like match made in heaven.
- Yes..
- Vicky.
- Come and see the picture.
- Coming, brother-in-law.
They are finalizing
a bride for him.
Vicky, what's taking so long?
I told him that he
should tell everyone.
We can hide pregnancy, but hiding
your love ruins everything.
Come on.
Coming, sister. It's all ruined.
Come, take a look at her.
Isn't she beautiful?
Sister? What kind
of a girl is she?
What's wrong with her?
She looks so lame compared
to our Siddharth.
She's absolutely perfect
for our Siddharth.
You better take
another look at her.
I don't think she can
handle a family.
Brother-in-law, our family
will be the talk of the town.
Stop talking nonsense.
Do you think we'll wait
for your approval?
I like her, the family
likes her so she's final.
You'll just take
her to his room.
But he's going to suffer.
Why don't you ask Appu?
He's never said no to me.
He will do as I say.
I know my son really well.
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, Sid. Come. Come.
What's going on? Everyone's
sitting together.
- Surprise!
- Even, I have a surprise for you.
- But, you go first.
- No, you first.
Someone, please say something, we've
been waiting for a long time.
Dad..
I am in love!
I wanted to tell you after
everything was clear.
I was waiting..to
surprise all of you.
Dad..
What's wrong, uncle? Did
I say something wrong?
Your father chose a girl..
..she is the daughter
of his friend.
Everyone in the
family liked her.
That's when you came in and
told them about your love.
I think they were hurt.
Dad, ice-cubes.
Dad..dad..
- See you..
- Dad.
So did say yes for the wedding?
Someone brought a marriage
proposal for me as well.
But, I didn't even
see his picture.
My marriage should
be my decision.
And, your marriage
should be your decision.
How can they fix your wedding
without your decision?
They should've asked you.
Never say that again.
My family is important for me.
They mean everything to me.
Nothing else matters to me.
Siddharth, come son.
Sit, eat your dinner.
Why can't he marry
the girl he likes?
He never went against
any of your decisions.
And, we're lucky to
have a son like him.
Brother-in-law, your silence
won't solve anything.
Watching you not speaking with your son
makes a lot of people happy, but..
But what did go wrong?
You just want to keep your promise
which you made to your friend, right?
Nothing's lost yet, you can
still keep your promise. Yeah..
I've no one this
world, brother-in-law.
Except for you.
If I marry that girl, then you
can still keep your promise.
Please say yes, brother-in-law.
Please.
I always respected everyone..
But he broke my bones.
We can convince everyone
in your family..
..but, how will we
convince your father?
Why don't we get married first
and then take his blessings.
- He will definitely accept us.
- We cannot do that.
Only useless people do
that sort of thing.
Hey, I have an idea.
We'll tell him that
I am pregnant.
Then he cannot refuse.
My dad knows me too well.
He will never believe it.
Hi.
- Hi. - I want to meet Mr.
Ashok, director of this company.
- Thank you.
- This way.
Okay.
Excuse me, dad.
But, if we follow this our
budget will overshoot.
Friends, I've taken
everything into aspect.
The budget is absolutely right.
- I want you to final this, Mr. Moorthy.
- Yes, sir.
Siddharth, you were right.
- I think Ashok sir's decision
isn't correct. - No, Moorthy.
Dad has taken the
right decision.
He is always right.
Morning.
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.
I need to meet Mr. Ashok.
Oh, he's going there.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Sir.
Sir.
Sir..
Nandini, have you
lost your mind.
I told you not to
do anything crazy.
What are you up to?
What's crazy about it?
We can get married if
your father agrees.
That's why I came
here to convince him.
He's not talking to me.
He's completely shattered.
And, if you say something
absurd he'll be more hurt.
Please.
Dad..
Dad, please talk to me.
I don't mind if the entire
world stops talking to me.
But atleast not you.
Dad, you're my world.
For all the kids
around the world..
..their father is their hero.
When they see the
father of other kids..
..they don't see anything
special in them.
When they don't listen to us..
..we feel like they
are avoiding us.
When we start our life, it has
family, responsibility, everything.
That's when we understand
the role of our father.
And after everything, when
we want to apologize..
..we already lose our father.
And left only with regret.
I don't want to regret, dad.
I care about your
love rather than..
..the girl that I just met.
Please, dad.
Sorry, dad.
Nandini, forgive me.
Nothing matters to me the most,
compared to my dad's love.
I will marry the
girl of his choice.
Nothing matters to me
then my son's happiness.
Siddharth will marry
the girl he wants.
That means I'm no
one in your life.
- That's not it. - I thought even,
I am a part of your family.
But you separated
me from your life.
Nandini.
I will convince my
friend somehow.
Because I can't be happy
when my son's sad.
Until now, I stayed quiet
and was angry with him.
Not because he went against me.
It's because I couldn't
give him my approval.
You know we're in this
position because of him.
He's the reason for all the
happiness in this house.
And, we shouldn't forget that.
He gave us happiness,
and we made his sad.
Your friend Jagdish is
coming over today evening.
How will you explain
him, brother?
No marriage..everything
is damaged.
Appu's just like the
Indian Cricket team.
He gets to the final round and then loses.
He comes again.
But, we still support
the India team.
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
No matter what, even if I have
to move heaven and earth..
- ..or break my sister's head..
- What are you saying?
..but, I won't let this
wedding take place.
Appu..
I am behind you, and
Karnataka's behind me.
- Cauvery's ours..and Nandini is ours too.
- Nandini?
No, Nandini is just yours.
Ashok..
I don't know how to tell you.
But my daughter doesn't
like this proposal.
She ran away from home thinking
that we might force her.
She is very stubborn.
We don't know where
she is these days.
Don't worry, your
daughter will come back.
She will be safe.
Actually, even Siddharth is
not happy with this alliance.
I didn't know how to tell you.
It's a good thing
you said it first.
Oh, God.
We would've ruined their lives..
..by getting them married.
And, our friendship
would've been over too.
Thank God.
- God is great.
- God is great.
Friendship..celebrating..
Brother-in-law..do you want
to ruin your son's life?
- Have you lost your mind?
- What is this, Vicky?
Why are you sounding
like a madman?
Be quiet, sister.
Brother-in-law is behaving like
this because you always kept quiet.
- What's wrong with him?
- Brother-in-law, if he's your friend..
..then invite him over,
offer him tea-coffee..
..but, not your son.
Ashok, what nonsense is this?
- Who is he?
- Relax.
- Calling me nonsense!
- Jagdish.
- Check on Google..
- Idiot!
- Is this a joke?
- I am the joke, or are you?
Couldn't you find someone in
Bengaluru for your daughter..
..that you want our Appu?
Have you seen your
daughter's face?
Don't you dare say anything
about my daughter?
- Vicky..
- Uncle..
What are you doing?
- Uncle..
- Vicky..
- Leave me.
- Vicky, listen to me.
I won't spare you.
I'll show you..
Let's go.
- Jagdish, come on.
- Calm down.
- Come on.
- Idiot! Nonsense! Rascal!
- I don't want to see his face again.
- Sit down.
Appu, find a good
lawyer and divorce him.
You're too much, uncle.
Be quiet.
- Don't worry. Everything will be fine.
- Calm down.
- Drink some water.
- You keep quiet.
If we keep quiet, how
will you have kids, Appu?
Uncle, control.
Out of control Siddharth!
I love you Siddharth.
You must love me.
I must go find a lawyer.
- Siddharth.
- Nandini..
- Leave me.
- Please, please.
Go away, Nandini.
- Nandini. Nandini.
- I want to talk to your father.
- Hello, Nandini.
- Leave me.
- Nandini.
- Sir..
I love your son.
- Don't stop us.
- Keep quiet.
Don't interfere between us.
You're the villain
in our love-story.
That's..
Nandini.
- Mom?
- Nandini.
Dad..
..she's the girl I love.
- You were in Australia dear..
- Father.
- ..and hiding from us.
- What is all this, dear?
- You'll embarrass us.
- But she's the one I chose for you.
She's my friend's daughter.
Father chose the same
girl, so did the son.
If only they had seen the picture,
things would've been better.
Oh, God.
In all this tension
I drank neat.
Now my stomach's burning.
Oh, God.
You could've at least told
us that you're in Australia.
- We were really worried about you.
- Drink this.
- Thanks.
- Welcome.
Drink this buttermilk.
Dear..
Nandini, what a sweet name.
Drink the buttermilk, dear.
Don't drink alcohol.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Let's keep the
engagement in Bangalore.
- Is it okay?
- Of course.
We're done with our work here.
We've also booked
return tickets.
We must leave.
- Where is Nandini?
- She..
I'll go get her, sir.
Stupid.
We'll meet at our engagement.
It will be a long gap. Isn't it?
Appu, everyone's still fixing your
engagement not your baby shower.
- Please go. Go.
- I didn't see anything.
Dad, I'll attend that
tender meeting today.
- Siddharth, I'll come along for
the tender meeting. - Dad..
You've always sacrificed family
parties, get-togethers, and functions.
It's enough.
After today, you won't miss
a single family party.
You will stay at home.
As I promised, this project is going
to be a new year gift for you.
Okay, Sid.
We'll wait for you,
come back soon.
The biggest oil pipe project
for Sydney goes to..
Ashok and Company.
- Congrats.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Hey..
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Sir..
Murthy?
Murthy?
Sir, your private jet..
..crashed, and your
entire family..
"Why did the waves look tired?"
"Why are the mountains falling?"
"The raindrops are thirsty."
"The moon has lost
its moonlight."
"The clouds have disappeared."
"The birds are not
flapping their wings."
"Everything seems
to have stopped."
"Even the cold breeze
has stopped.."
"..and the world has
stopped spinning around."
"I am drenched in a
deluge of fire."
"How will the flowers
blossom now?"
"My life..seems lost."
"Nothing looks familiar to me."
"Unknown paths are unfolding."
"The darkness is spreading,
and I've lost everything."
"Everywhere I look,
I see new faces."
"Whatever I try to think, the same
old memories come back to me."
"I got everything
I ever desired.."
"..and lost
everything I wanted."
"How will I swim across?"
"Even the cold breeze
has stopped.."
"..and the world has
stopped spinning around."
Thanks..dad..
You're welcome.
He doesn't answer the phone.
"Moments pass by.."
"..they mean nothing to me."
"My only support..are
still there."
"Nothing's left except for me."
"No one knows the path ahead."
"Everything seems
to have stopped."
"Even the cold breeze
has stopped.."
"..and the world has
stopped spinning around."
"Why did the waves look tired?"
"The raindrops are thirsty."
"The moon has lost
its moonlight."
Here you go.
Appu.
Krishna.
Appu! Appu.
How are you, Appu?
It's been so long
since we last met.
I guess you haven't
forgotten anything.
And the proof is this "doll".
Are your parents alright?
What kind of surprise is this?
Why come down here so suddenly?
This is where I left, now fate
has brought me back here.
We don't let the children
here feel they are orphans.
That's why we keep
them in hostels.
Everyone loves "Appu" here.
He's never seen his parents.
Please give him lots of love.
Don't worry. We
don't have kids..
..so he means
everything to us now.
God gave me everything.
And, He took everything
back, Krishna.
Everywhere I would go, their
memories would haunt me.
I couldn't stay there,
so I came back here.
I've no one except for you
and this orphanage, Krishna.
I'll need time to come
out of this incident.
Can, I live here for some time?
This is your home.
You don't need
permission to stay here.
Come on.
- Hello, aunty.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Did you have your coffee?
- Not yet.
- Haven't you?
- Chikkanna.
- Nagraj, where is chikkanna?
- Haven't seen him.
Where could he be?
"Call me wild if you like.."
"Keep calling me all the time.."
"But I am crazy about buffaloes,
and I'll ride it all day."
Chikkanna, what's going on?
The milkmaid's on her honeymoon.
There's no one to bring the milk.
That's why I bought this buffalo here.
Go make coffee first.
What's the hurry?
I can make a decoction, and
coffee only when she gives milk.
Appu. Appu..
Good morning, dad.
Come and have coffee.
Sit.
- Greetings.
- Greetings.
Hello, sir.
When you were here,
this was an orphanage.
Now, this is an old age home.
Hello. How are you, son?
Yes, son.
- Yes, okay..
- One needs an old age home..
..more than schools,
colleges, and hospitals.
After a certain age, no one
looks after the parents.
Coffee..
Here you go.. this one's yours.
- Thank you.
- Is he new here?
You look like from
Sadashiv Nagar.
What brings you here?
- Forget it. How's the coffee?
- It's nice.
- Thank you.
- What kind of coffee is this?
It's so plain, no milk at all.
Who will call this coffee?
The old man has lost his mind.
He finds fault in everything.
Don't worry. That's
what he always does.
No matter what we do, its
never enough for them.
Right from food, breakfast, coffee to
their children and grandchildren..
..they are not
happy with anyone.
They are always worried
about themselves.
They are restless souls.
Krishna, no one knows I am here.
I left Australia without
telling anyone.
Nandini and uncle must
be really worried.
I must go meet them.
Fine, go meet them.
And come back soon.
- Here.. Here..
- Another fritter, please.
You've grown old but can't control
your hunger for fritters.
You haven't lost
your greed for food.
Don't eat these things,
and you'll be healthy.
Brother, that beard
didn't suit you at all.
But this suits you so well, better
than it suits on anyone else.
Sit down, I'll serve breakfast.
The rice-cakes are really nice.
- You eat.
- You call these rice-cakes, huh!
They are hard like rocks.
And this lentil tastes awful.
Unfortunately..
It was his voice,
but I lip-synced.
Finish your breakfast,
this is his daily routine.
Finish your breakfast,
I'll get your coffee.
- Hello, sir, please listen..
- I won't listen to anything.
The deadline ends tomorrow.
If you don't pay up you won't
live to tell the tale.
I will throw you out on the streets
along with those other old people.
Krishna..shall we?
Uncle.
Siddharth.
Where were you? We
were worried for you.
Is business okay?
We didn't get any
news from your side.
Sorry, uncle.
Actually, I was not in the
mood to talk to anyone.
I cannot forget what happened.
Uncle..I don't know whether
dad told you this or not..
- But I..
- Forget it, Siddharth.
He told me everything.
And, I fixed this wedding
only after that.
You were raised in that house.
One can guess the son's nature
by looking at his father.
You just have to be strong.
Be strong.
Uncle, how is Nandini?
Look, please stay with us now.
It'll be easier for you to
forget if you stay with us.
Nandini, it's not
easy to forget them.
I can understand your feeling.
I will be alright.
I feel at home in
that orphanage.
I feel at peace and feel
surrounded by family.
You can stay wherever you want.
You can come here
whenever you want.
By the way, this
is your home too.
- Boss, Amrutanjan (pain balm)!
- Amruntanjan?
- Why?
- Yes, it's evening.
The guys will get drunk..
..and the women hurdle
up in front of the TV.
The guys get drunk, and
the women loosen up.
If someone's fighting on the television,
they will start fighting too.
- Give me the remote.
- There they go.
Give me the remote.
This is not your personal TV.
You know I watch television
every day at this hour.
- Do I have to keep telling you?
- This TV is for everyone..
..not just you alone.
You can watch when
I am not watching.
You won't touch the remote
as long as I am watching.
I cannot fight with
you..you're always arguing.
- That's why your family chucked you out.
- I see..
Why did they leave you?
- You got thrown out of the house too.
- See..
We get tortured by their
arguments every day.
They say there's no
tolerance in this country.
There should be
tolerance in the house.
But, if you have a mother
like her and a wife..
..then the man gets troubled.
Understand.
He can't support his
mother or his wife.
He can't upload this
on Facebook either..
..that's why he gets confused
and suffers in the end.
In the end, he gets fed up and
leaves his parents in this..
..old age home and
live peacefully.
Even after throwing them
out of their home..
..they give their children
all their property.
And give them every detail.
But what do we care?
See you, boss.
Boss, boss..boss,
don't close the door.
Someone's coming.
But it's 10:30.
For them, it's just
the beginning.
He'll go around the entire city,
meet up with his friends..
..and get a peg for
himself and me too.
- Hi, handsome.
- Hi, sir.
I've kept your
dinner in your room.
- This is yours.
- Thank you.
Who is he?
His name is Siddharth,
he lives here.
Did your family send you to the
old age home at such a young age?
Or, are you tired
of life so soon?
- I am Mohammad Rafi.
- Hello.
- Would you like a peg too?
- No, thanks.
I sent you an amazing
video on whatsapp.
Watch it.
- Is it about wrestling?
- Of course.
"The moonlight face.."
"- And the golden tresses.."
- Rafi sir.. he's not like the others.
He's very nice.
He never complains about anyone.
Not even his son,
who left him here.
He never takes money
from anyone..
..and stays happy
with whatever he has.
Goodnight, boss.
Time for my drink.
Father, next week we're
shifting into our new home.
And, I am giving you the
first invitation card.
Please come to the
function, father.
The government allotted me this
plot when I was still working.
This is my plot and my money.
And, you built a home on it.
And now, you want
to live happily..
..while your father rots
in this old age home!
Boss, intolerence.
Please do come, sir.
See you, Krishna.
Hello, sir.
Hello, uncle.
- Hi.
- What are you thinking?
Nothing.
Tell me, Siddharth.
Uncle, dad had many ideas..
..but, he couldn't finish them.
So, I am thinking about
completing some of them.
I have decided, the most
important are charities.
I've decided to give 40 %
of my profit to charities.
I just want to tell you and
get the funds released.
What's wrong, uncle?
What happened?
Doesn't seem right to tell you in
your condition but, I must tell you.
I think good things don't happen
to good people, Siddharth.
Ashok had designed a Polio fund
to help everyone in the society.
But, he didn't tell you
about the lack of funds.
The entire state was
hating your father.
The entire population of
the state was against him.
"- Ashok.. - Down-Down!"
Down-Down!"
Down-Down!"
There were dangerous chemicals in
the medicine which Ashok funded..
..because of which many
children fell sick.
Some children died as well.
The ex-Health Minister was
jailed for the Polio Scam.
Ashok was also served
a court notice.
But, before he could tell
you any of this, Ashok..
I know he's innocent.
But, we don't have
evidence to prove it.
And, he's not alive either.
I don't know in whose
favor will this case go.
But as his son, everyone
is going to blame you.
I think you should go
back to Australia.
I am not someone who hides..
..and, my father never
taught me to do so.
The man who gave
me my identity..
..I can do anything to
save his reputation.
Siddharth.
'We should do something
for our country.'
'If we set out to help someone, we'll
have to face many difficulties.'
'Then, we should change our
path, but not our goal.'
Boss, Krishna borrowed some
money to run the orphanage.
He's been paying the interest
with great difficulty.
But, he couldn't do
so last three months.
And the financier
through everyone out.
Brother Krishna begged and
pleaded, but to no avail.
Sir, please.. please
listen to me.
Old people live here.
- Sir..
- Get out!
Get lost with these old folks.
Hey, lock all doors.
Appu!
It's not wrong to ask
for your money..
..but your method is wrong.
Here's a blank cheque.
Fill in your amount plus the interest
as well for your hospital bills.
If you ever come
back here again..
Let's go inside.
I've people earn
millions for themselves.
But never saw anyone give
millions for others until now.
No wonder people call him
Karnataka's Millionaire.
You were facing so many
problems and didn't tell me.
- What did you think? Was I dead?
- No, Appu.
You were dealing with
your own problems..
..and, I didn't want to
trouble you anymore.
When those guys were
standing outside..
..I could see fear,
embarrassment in their eyes.
Where would they have gone
without the old age home?
For a minute, it reminded
me of my own past.
And I realized that no one should
go through the same trouble.
They should be happy,
always smiling.
"The doll rocks and clinkers."
"You are my prince."
"The doll rocks and clinkers."
"You are my prince."
"New directions are unfolding."
"Old wounds are healing."
"It's sacred, it's
loveable and its mine."
"You cannot throw it down,
or throw it up in the air.."
"..or ever give
up and bow down."
"The doll rocks and clinkers."
"You are my prince."
Wow..nice one.
- Be quiet.
- Great.
Why isn't anyone talking to me?
No one was talking
when I was at home.
It's the same thing
all over again.
If you keep fighting for the
TV, who will talk to you?
It's not my fault.
No one ever talked
to me at home.
What else could I
do alone at home?
I started watching television.
Abhi, I've told you so many
times not to speak with granny.
She will spoil you.
Your mother is spoiling my son.
She can't even speak
English properly.
Do you know how
embarrassing that is?
It is clear, either your mother
stays in this house or me.
And that's how English
became my enemy, son.
You don't need to worry if
you don't know English.
A lot of people can't even
speak Kannada properly.
I'll teach you English.
What are you saying?
English and me?
That's impossible.
If you can learn Kannada, which
has such a huge diction..
..then why not English, which
has only 26 alphabets.
Asthma case.
"House for sale"

"Always lost in the

"No one's like you."
You call these pancakes.
You don't even know how
to make them properly.
Such terrible day
even on a festival.
I am so unfortunate.
I'll be there by 1:30.
Have your food. Okay.
Boss, boss, boss,
don't eat that.
The old man left that saying
it's not cooked properly.
I'll get you another one.
Doesn't matter.
Never get up in the middle
when you're eating.
Some people don't get
this much either..
..and some people are so
unfortunate that no..
..one cares whether
they ate or not.
Our life is just a dream
for other people.
We should be happy
with whatever we have.
Go get me some butter.
- Long live..
- The Minister!
- Long live..
- The Minister!
- Long live..
- The Minister!
- Long live..
- The Minister!
This is a big responsibility,
I am very happy.
I want to serve the
people and my party.
That's why I've been appointed
the Health Minister.
I will always execute my job and
my responsibility honestly.
Will you tell us about your schemes,
your plans, and your thoughts?
- Are you on Twitter?
- Yes, sir.
- Then follow me on Twitter.
- Okay, sir.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Grandma, are you really
learning English..
..or trying to fool us with
the book in your hand.
- I am learning, son.
- I see.. let me test you.
What is this?
FLOWER..Flower.
- What does that mean?
- It means 'Flower'.
And this?
- P O W E R.. Power.
- Meaning?
Him!
- Nice!
- Yeah.
My son's moving into
his new home today.
My son came all the way
here to invite me.
I want to go but, I've left them
behind, as well as the house.
So, I feel strange
going there alone.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Papa.
Bless you.
Are you okay?
I am really happy
to see you here.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Come, papa.
- Sir, can I serve you some rice.
- No, it's enough.
- Just a little..
- No..
Don't force him if
he doesn't want to.
He'll eat as much he wants.
Don't waste that rice you
can feed someone else.
Towel, papa.
You've built a nice home.
It's entirely my fault.
If I stay here, I'll
only cause you trouble.
If I ever hurt you,
then forgive me.
See you..
Take care.
Papa. These things are
common in a family.
Don't gloat over it.
You have a home, children,
granddaughter..
..so why do you want to
live in that old age home?
- Listen to me, and please stay.
- Please, papa.
Papa, please.
Krishna.
Do come again..I'll
stay with my son now.
Papa!
Papa!
Krishna, did you see
how happy he was?
No matter how much
we look after him..
..but he feels happy
around the children.
Children's love is
really essential.
Being happy doesn't mean
property, money fame or fortune.
We should learn to
be always happy.
I am an orphan too.
But I got everything in life.
Even though he has everything,
why should he be an orphan?
Every parent should be
happy with their children.
Parents got their
children polio vaccine..
..for the good health
of their children.
But these children fell
sick after the vaccination.
The government hasn't
taken any action yet.
They're left to
die..because they are poor.
Those who indulge in corruption
in the name of Polio..
..are demons and
not human beings.
Doesn't matter what the
expenses will be..
..but, our charity will
help you in every way.
- Okay.
- All these children should be cured.
- You can call me anytime.
- Thank you, sir.
Uncle, I want to meet
that ex-Health Minister.
That's how the system works.
Isn't the quality of the polio drops
checked before sending to the booths?
Everything was
perfectly alright.
In fact, I personally got it checked
and then signed the papers.
I don't know what
happened overnight.
I was trapped.
Siddharth, how will
this lab test help us?
You see, uncle the samples
which the Minister checked..
..and the drops administered in
the booths are the same or not.
What if the polio drops in
the booths are different?
We'll know who is
behind this scam.
And then he will be exposed.
You're right.
- Long live..
- The Minister!
- Long live..
- The Minister!
- What is the next program?
- Sir, you have to visit an old age home.
Yes, Mr. Tiwari.
- Happy birthday, sir.
- Thank you.
- We must speak.
- Yeah, see you in Delhi.
Goodbye.
- You're doing a great job.
- Thank you.
- Appu, he's the Health Minister.
- Hello, sir.
He came here to
celebrate his birthday.
- He is..
- You were praising our old age home.
The entire credit goes to him.
Very good.
I feel really proud of my country
when I see youngsters like you.
People like you
should join politics.
It's a good platform.
That's what my dad used to say.
If you want to rule hearts, one
must have political power.
But, I love the masses, sir.
- All I need is my will power.
- Well said.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Engagement in such a situation..
- Siddharth.
Your father fixed
this engagement.
He would've celebrated
this if he had been alive.
Say yes, Appu.
Shall we?
The auspicious time
is passing away.
Call your family.
Don't make excuses.
Jagdish, call your
family members.
We're running out of time.
Actually..
I guess the family is here.
Call them quickly we must begin the
rituals according to the scriptures.
Appu, the engagement's done.
But, you must throw a bachelor's
party before the wedding.
Where will you take us?
Goa. Goa. Goa. Goa.
- Hi, how are you?
- Good.
Stop drooling already.
We're in Goa.
We still have to get a massage,
and party hard, etc.etc.
Happy ending.
- Happy ending meaning..
- All's well that ends well.
You guys have a lot of plans, but you
need a guy who knows Goa really well.
That is already arranged.
The guy is on the way.
'Regional song'
'Regional song'
Hi, girls.
'Regional song'
'Regional song'
- Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
- Hi.
Welcome to Goa.
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.
I am Jayasurya Sushant aka
Joseph Anthony Gonsalves.
- That's my name.
- His name is even longer than he is.
You see, I am from
karnataka settled in Goa.
You're from Karnataka.
can guess from your face.
Ladies and Oldies, if you want any
information about Goa, then ask me.
Don't use Jio sim
because its free.
And this is my assistant.
- Yes.
- We're at your service.
Who is this?
A useless machine amongst
these old machineries.
- I am the cook.
- What do you cook?
- You will soon find out.
- For your kind information.
Do you guys want to see
Old Goa or New Goa?
- Or that Goa.
- What does 'that' mean?
Take you over there.
Let's start, go, go.
- Yes, come on..
- That's it. Come on.
- Nice..Come on..
- He's getting so excited at this age..
- Wonder what was he like when
he was young. - Come on, hard.
- Come on, come on..nice.
- Okay, go. Go.
That cook wants to book her.
My son never made me this happy.
Don't worry.
No matter how much you
take care of your son..
..but, after the marriage,
he goes his own way.
That's how life is nowadays.
Zip it.
The old machineries are
cooling down in the pool.
What a useless boy.
Drinking coconut water in Goa.
Drink beer.
It's really fun.
Throw this away.
Enjoy.
I saw what I
shouldn't have seen.
Oh, God. They are
such mad people.
- Come on..come on.
- At least wear your underwear.
Don't you have a reputation?
Very good..
- Sir, soft drink.
- No, I don't want it. thanks.
Hey, Appu. Come on, let's dance.
Coming.
Excuse me, sir.
Sir, this cruise and this
getup are very expensive.
Is that alright? Is it okay?
You can spend all you want.
Hello..he's our debit
card and credit card.
His father is like Aadhar card.
- You can swipe all you want.
- Bloody midget.
- Hi, having fun?
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.
- Have a foreign drink?
- No, I'll drink Indian.
- You're in Goa, have a foreign drink?
- No, I drink Indian drink.
When I was in trouble, and sad,
Vinay Maliya helped me out.
Now he's in trouble, so
I should help him out.
Drunkards are honest,
and not like you.
Cheers..
What is this? You're
playing such a sad song.
Hey, man, this song is not nice.
Put something new..
Useless, I can speak your dialect
too..I am from your area.
I'll play something nice.
- Go have a drink..run away.
- Okay.
This is the fun.
"It's a face-off
(battle), Oh my love! "
"It's a face-off, Oh Lord!
Oh my love!"
"When our caravan
of love set out.."
"..people got jealous,
lovers got united."
"That's the tradition of love."
"It's a face-off
(battle), Oh my love!"
"It's a face-off, Oh Lord!
Oh my love!"
I tell him not to drink so
much, but he doesn't listen.
The doctor's said he'll
die if he drinks.
He also has a heart
problem, boss.
I love you.
Take care.
This old man seems
to be in a hurry.
- Is everyone ready?
- Ready!
- Ready!
- Come, come,
- Enjoy, enjoy.
- Okay.
Don't miss anything.
You can't even stand
on your feet..
..yet you have hope.
Good, good, good..enjoy.
These old men are
enjoying their life.
All the old men are
getting a massage..
..and you're busying
messaging someone.
They are getting physical enjoyment,
while you're happy watching it.
I guess your life
is a closed book.
How did you know?
You don't even open your eyes
properly how will you see this world?
- Open your's first.
- What?
Eyes!
I'll get a massage too.
That was fun.
- Stop.
- Wait..where are you going?
Careful.
Do slowly, don't press on that.
- Okay.
- Carefully.
Careful..very good.
Let's jump..higher.
You try.
- You'll enjoy this.
- Can't you just drive straight?
What are you saying?
Let me show you..
He was forcing me to drink beer.
But now he's dead from
drinking all that sea water.
"- Love me or hate me."
- Nice singing.
"- Kiss me or kill me."
- Come on, enjoy.
"Oh darling, do
something with me."
Sir, I've been noticing
since yesterday.
Everyone's enjoying.
But you two are quiet.
What's the matter?
Last year we came
here with our family.
We are missing those days.
By the way, parents never want to
live separate from their children.
'Papa, I want to
live separately.
How much more trouble will I
have to bear for this family?'
'Why? You're not alone
shouldering the burden.
I work hard too.'
'Does he have to do everything if
he's the eldest in the house?'
'Think before you speak.
He bought the TV and
fridge in this house.'
'But everyone uses them.'
'I am tired of debating over
this house is his or mine.'
'I want to live separately
now, please give me my share.'
A family is when
everyone lives together.
Don't worry, sir.
Everything will be fine.
Hello, sir.
Is everything okay, sir?
- By the way, which is his parent?
- No one.
- I want to know whose son he is.
- No one.
He treats everyone in this
old age home as his parents.
And they treat him
like their child.
- No one's related here.
- Great..
People spend their
lives differentiating.
And he's happy in
making others happy.
He has a big heart.
'Family is when everyone
lives together.'
Happy Birthday.
Happy Birthday, Appu.
You're surprised
how we found out.
Well, if you can worry for us..
..we can know things
about you too.
Don't think you're alone.
We're with you.
Happy Birthday to you!
Happy Birthday to you!
Happy Birthday, Dear Appu.
Appu, get married really soon.
And have a dozen kids.
And be happy.

Children are falling sick
after getting polio drops.
Look, what happened to him?
Something happened to my son.
Please save him.
We must give them
vaccine immediately.
But, it's not in the hospital.
- It's costly.
- Oh God.
Get it from somewhere
outside, doctor.
Don't worry about the expenses.
Doctor..
Transfer the funds to my
account, immediately.
Doctor, please take a
look at my daughter.
- What's wrong with my daughter?
- Oh God!
Sir..
Sir, why are you worried?
Is your family member
admitted here?
- Or maybe some kid you know?
- Yes..
Doctor, see what's
wrong with my son.
None of my family members
are amongst them.
But, this is happening
because of my family, son.
..the reason is the current Health
Minister Jagannath, and he's my son.
'There was a competition between the
two to become the Health Minister.'
'High Command chose Shridhar.'
'He knew that he would
become the minister..'
'..that's why Jagannath
okayed a 2 billion project.'
'Whereas he planned to sabotage NRI
Ashok and Shridhar's polio program.'
Stop, stop..
Sir, I am a journalist. I've
information about the polio vaccine.
When I was performing a sting
operation, some gang attacked me.
Some bigshot is
behind this, sir.
If I keep this camera with
me, I'll be in grave danger.
They will kill me.
Please handover this camera to
the police, sir. Please, sir.
Jagannath was no
longer a human being..
..he had turned into a demon.
Jagannath! I tried to
used the camera footage..
..to make him surrender.
But he threatened me
instead and made..
..the inspector shoot the
journalist in front of my eyes.
Sir, don't kill me. Please.
Father..
I ran away to give that
evidence to the media..
..but his goons were
looking for me everywhere.
I even went to the Police
Commissioner to ask for justice.
But..
I knew that the medicine cannot
be stopped from circulation..
..that's why I went to the place
where the Health Minister..
..was going to
inaugurate the vaccine.
But my effort was a waste..
..and I couldn't raise a voice
against this injustice.
He killed innocent
children for that post.
But, he couldn't
erase the evidence.
But, I have evidence of his
misdeeds saved on a hard disk.
Even though I had proof,
no one believed me.
It's me, sir..Non Resident Indian
(NRI) Ashok's son Siddharth.
I was waiting for this proof.
Now I can use this to
prove my dad's innocence.
You can prove that your
father's innocent.
But, what about those
innocent kids.
This evidence is enough to
put my son behind bars.
But, he will be out in 6 months.
Political power.
No..he must face the same ordeal
as the parents of those children.
He must admit that
it was his mistake.
He must be punished.
This is not your problem
alone, Siddharth.
It's about the entire people.
You must fight this
battle for the people.
Today on Public Talk we have with
us Jagannath, our Health Minister.
- Welcome to Public Talk.
- Hello.
As you know, in this program the
public will ask you questions..
- ..and you must answer them.
- Sure. Ask.
Hello, sir. The people have to suffer
because of the shortage of ambulance.
I know that.
I've already approved 500 ambulances
for Bengaluru and other districts.
The next question..
Yes, gentlemen.
Sir, the government
hasn't given any aide..
..to the children
affected by Polio.
No, no, no, you've wrong information.
That is wrong.
The government has already
given a go ahead.
The Child Welfare
Association says..
..that they haven't received
any grant from the government.
- Excuse me. Pass it on.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, what a surprise. I am sorry.
I never received this. I
don't even know about this.
I'll solve this.
There are other
problems to solve, sir.
The medicines certified by the Drug
Control Department of Karnataka.
..and approved by the
ex-Health Minister..
..and the medicines delivered to
the Polio booth are different.
Look here..lab reports.
Someone else is
behind this, sir.
We must expose them.
Yes, we must..
The people should know, and
so should the government.
This case should be
handed to the CBI.
Yes, CBI. Give it to the CBI.
Give it to the CBI.
The rascal who toyed with the
lives of innocent children..
..should be punished.
This case should be
handed to the CBI.
- That's what we demand.
- Yeah, you're right.
That's the right thing to do.
The government is
with the public.
And, we must do as
the people say.
We'll hand this over to the CBI.
You have my complete support.
I'll talk to the government and hand
this case over to the government.
- Thank you.
- Thank you gentleman..
- ..for bringing this matter to the light.
- Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming, sir.
Thank you.
Hey..stop!
Stop the car!
He's telling me to hand
over this case to CBI.
He thinks he's smart.
I've seen him somewhere.
But where?
He lives where my father lives.
That means my father is
hiding at the old age home.
Sir, I thought we were safe..
- ..but we're all going to get in trouble.
- What happened?
I thought that no one will
question us if we blame an NRI.
But there's a man who has come
forward to ask questions.
The guy who was
questioning you..
- ..was the NRI's son.
- Oh my, God.
He has all the case details.
So they want to destroy us.
That proof have with my father.
And he want to prove it.
If we'll leave him like this
then he will destroy us.
Hello.
Like you said, I paid
the hospital bills.
But are those kids safe?
You did a good job saving
those kids, Siddharth.
It's my duty, sir.
- They..they are Jagannath's men.
- Hey, stop!
Hey, come out everyone.
Now you're scared
and hiding inside.
You were questioning our
boss on television.
You wanted to show your
strength, didn't you?
- Come out.
- Come out.
I said come out.
Hey..you guys are
sycophants of your boss.
But he needs no one..he's
a power house himself.
Sir, you must leave
for Delhi tomorrow.
You have a meeting
with the High Command!
Sending 10 men to kill
me isn't your fault.
But it's your mistake
that I'll be scared.
I give you a week's time.
You must admit to your mistake
and surrender yourself.
- What if I don't?
- I will make you.
I still have that hard
disk as evidence.
I'll spread that video over
TV, internet, and phone.
Then the public will drag
you out of your home.
Don't get carried away, hand
over that evidence to me.
And you can take all the
money you want in return.
My dad was an honest
man, and so am I.
The consequences
will be really bad.
If you attack me 100 times,
I'll retaliate 100 times.
But, if I attack..then that will
become tomorrow's headlines.
Appu.
Appu.
I haven't seen the old
lady since morning.
- What?
- She knows nothing around Bengaluru..
..she's never gone out
of the old age home.
I don't know where she could be.
The consequences can be worse.
I really like my grandson.
Come, Krishna.
You love your grandson.
But you're afraid
to talk to him.
How long are you going
to hide your love?
Abhi!
How long has this been going on?
How many times have I told you
not to mingle with this lady?
What lady?
You're a lady, I am a lady.
You're a mother, I am a mother.
You have a son, I have a son.
The only difference is I
am good, and you're bad.
Did you hear that?
Now I've to hear that from
this illiterate woman.
If he keeps meeting this old
woman, my son will get spoiled.
If you say another word against
mother, I won't stay quiet.
She's speaking in English too,
you're the one who has no values.
Abhi come let's go.
No mom. I want to stay
with my grandmother.
- Abhi.
- Now do you get it?
When your son didn't
follow you, you felt hurt.
And you kept us apart all these
years, imagine our plight.
Mom..
You proved that you're a son.
Forgive me, mom.
Let's go home.
This won't happen again.
Doesn't matter, son.
My other son is here
to look after me.
- Appu, I'll keep visiting you.
- Of course, grandma.
- Let's go.
- Yes, dear.
Appu, I text you..whatsapp.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Calm down.
There's no point
in shedding tears.
It won't melt your
children's heart.
Chikkanna, take him to his room.
- Yes. Come, sir.
- Go.
- Go.
- If you had cried when you should have..
..then you wouldn't
be crying now.
How many children
you do you have?
Krishna..monthly expenses.
He came here seeking
refuge, and I took him in.
When one leaves,
another one joins in.
People never change.
Yes.
Brother, ex-Health Minister is
out of prison by NRI's son.
- Long live..
- Shridhar.
- Long live..
- Shridhar.
If the CBI takes over this
case, then I will cooperate.
Ex-Health Minister is
out of jail on bail.
There's a new twist in
the Polio scam case.
This is prashanth from Bengaluru
Did you find the evidence?
No, sir. I looked everywhere.
Only one more room
left to search.
I don't know what you will do.
But I want that
evidence tonight.
Otherwise, the
consequences will be bad.
I'll get it done tonight.
90 percent survival
is difficult.
Give this news to his children.
He has only one son,
and he lives abroad.
Krishna, his number.
The diary with the
number is in your room.
Fine, I'll talk to him.
These things are common
when one gets old.
I cannot come right away.
Sir, at least you can
talk to him on the phone.
What's left to talk?
He'll say the same old things.
And I'll get angry.
If its money you need,
I'll make the transfer.
You can do the rest.
Appu..
Rafi sir is conscious.
He's insisting on
calling his son.
I don't know what to do.
Please try again.
Talk to him, your
son is on the line.
Talk to him, please.
Asif, how are you?
I am fine, papa.
How are you now?
I am fine too.
You'll be fine.
Don't think too much.
I am coming tomorrow,
with my family.
You will be alright.
Goodbye, son.
Goodbye, father.
Krishna, did you give
him all the tablets?
- No, not yet.
- Fine, sit down.
You act well.
You talked to me on the phone.
The voice may have
sounded like my son.
But you talked to me.
I know, son..
I recognized you
through your breath.
That rascal doesn't
want to talk to me.
It's true. Only
because I insisted..
..you couldn't see my plight.
I just want to say that
I am dying happily.
In these 68 years..
..I only lived a
few days happily.
And, only after you
came in my life.
You gave me every
happiness I desired.
You also gave me a
life I never imagined.
You came in life like God.
You're the real Rajkumara
(Prince) for me.
You mean more to me than my son.
If I am born again, I'll
be reborn as your son.
To repay your debts.
Sir.
- Hello. - Boss, we have the
hard disk along with the proofs.
Call me back after
checking all the details.
Seena, take this.
- Connect the hard disk.
- Okay.
"Seven wonders of this world."
"And the eight is
you and me, buddy."
"Seven wonders of this world."
- "And the eight is you and me, buddy."
- What an acting, what singing..
..what dancing! Acting
runs in his blood.
Do you like the song, guys?
Change the folder.
"Abracadabra."
"Why do the moon and the stars
disappear when the sun comes up."
"When the sun comes up."
"When the night falls
we can see them again."
"When the sun comes up,
we cannot see them."
He's been playing double
roll since he was a kid.
You guys didn't even know
how to wear your underwear.
You're amazing.
You should watch his childhood film.
You will be amazed.
Turn that off.
Thank you very much.
Thanks. Thanks.
Excuse me, just a minute.
- Hello.
- Boss, there's nothing on the hard disk.
What are you saying?
Send that folder.
Hurry up! Sorry..
Sorry, we were
discussing that topic..
- Will you please give that file to him.
- Okay.
"Classical rap..Indian steps."
Mr. Jagannath, how are you?
- I am fine. I am fine.
- Okay.
Hands up!
Hey..he tricked us.
I'll be swearing in
tomorrow evening.
He can do anything
with this evidence.
You must get that hard disk
before I reach Bengaluru.
Attack the old age home.
Even if my father's
there, don't stop.
I want that hard
disk at any cost.
I came to the old age
home to steal this.
There was a small hole in
my grand daughter's heart.
I needed one million
for the operation.
They said they will pay
me if I do this job.
My daughter called when I was
going to steal the hard disk.
And she said the operation
was successful.
The doctor said she's
perfectly alright.
Your trust gave me the
money for the operation.
That's when I knew that even
Lord won't forgive me..
..if I betray people like you.
Please forgive me, sir.
Appu..
- Where is the hard disk? Tell me.
- I don't know.
Where did you hide it? Tell me.
I don't know.
Hey, if you don't hand
over the hard disk..
..I will kill these people
in front of your eyes.
Leave me. Leave me. Leave me.
Leave me.
Leave me.
Where are you taking me?
Appu!
- Who staged this attack?
- Do you know who is behind this?
Is this some personal enmity?
Answer us.
- Listen.
- You're in charge of this old age home.
Is this how you run
your old age home.
People bring their parents here
thinking they will be safe.
But they are not safe.
If anything had happened to our
parents, who would've been responsible?
You guys!
You guys left your parents
at the old age home.
You're responsible for it.
Did you ever visit them
when they were fine?
That's our problem.
We never care for them
when they are okay.
If anything happens to them..
..then our mind starts working and
suddenly our love for them awakens.
Why don't you have the same
feeling when they live with you?
We don't know their values
when they are alive.
But we miss them
after they are dead.
The place where he
used to take a stroll.
We regret thinking about them.
We never ask about their
wishes when they are alive.
But later we cook their favorite
dishes and feed 100 people.
The love we give them when they
are alive, that's real love.
When parents send their children
to the hostel to study..
..they also bring
them back home.
But when parents grow
old, we cannot adjust.
We get irritated,
fight with them.
Send them to old age home.
But, we never bring them back.
Old people are just
like children.
You're lecturing us, but do you
take care of your parents?
I am not destined for that.
I'm an orphan.
How dare you come here!
A man who goes against anyone..
..can never be touched
by the likes of you.
Killing me is just a dream.
You're not worried about your
father who's in the ICU..
..then, why will you worry
about those innocent children?
Nor the old men in
the old age home!
You want this
evidence, don't you?
I just wanted to prove
my dad innocent.
But, it's my duty to protect those
old people in the old age home.
And listen, this battle
is between you and me.
You won't harm anyone else.
Either there's you..or me.
If anyone dies, then no
matter how hard to try..
..but I won't spare you.
Stop staring at him. Connect it.
Okay, sir.
I, Jagannath promise..
I, Jagannath promise..
According to the law made by
the constitution of India..
According to the law made by
the constitution of India..
I shall honestly
and faithfully..
I shall honestly
and faithfully..
I will serve my country..
I will serve my country..
While carrying out my duties..
While carrying out my duties..
As the Health Minister
of Karnataka..
Sir, that's the family folder.
Jagannath!
Listen..
Start the car immediately.
Let's go.
No one should have
any kind of problem.
Tell me whatever you need.
- I'll handle everything. Okay.
- Dr..
Please, expenses don't matter.
Just save my father.
Singapore, Malaysia, doesn't
matter where you have to take him.
Just save my father,
please doctor.
If money and medicines
can cure everything..
..then everyone coming to the
hospital would go back alive.
Today you want to
save your father..
..then just show him your love.
Go save him if you can.
Papa..
Papa..
I want to talk to you.
All your life to told me
to take the right path.
But, I never listened.
And now, I am regretting it.
You taught me how
to ride a bike..
..and I remembered that
but, I forgot the cycle.
I learned how to earn..
..but forgot what you taught me.
In my greed to acquire power..
..I forgot myself.
Papa..
..you never told me to get rich.
Not to become a doctor
or an engineer.
You just told me to
be an honest man..
..but, I even failed
to be a good son.
Papa, you've always
forgiven my mistake.
Please forgive me one
last time, papa.
Just give me one more chance.
Now, I will do as you say.
I'll become a good man.
Please, papa.
Please, papa.
Papa..
..won't you give me one
chance to reform myself.
My father was leading
a good life..
..but, I pushed him
towards his death.
And, you kept your father
alive in your heart and mind.
One doesn't need an minister
Or MP to reform this society.
A son like you in every
family is enough.
A person is blessed
with talents only once.
But, it stays till the end.
Thank you.
Careful, papa.
- Sorry, sir.
- It's okay.
Sorry, sir.
I am very sorry, sir.
- I'll take good care of my father.
- It's alright.
- Take good care of him.
- Here's the spray.
- See you, son.
- Bye. Bye.
KASTURI NIWASA (Kasturi
Orphan's Home)
Finally, the polio
scam comes to an end.
NRI Ashok and ex-Health Minister were
found innocent. It's been proven.
The present Health Minister Jagannath
has admitted to his crimes.
And, he has taken the entire
responsibility of this scam.
I am proud of you.
A real son is someone who
makes his father proud.
You won everyone's heart
with your smile, boss.
Those who were sad,
you gave them love.
You truly are a prince.
I wish your father was alive
he would've been really happy.
I never really felt that
my father is not alive.
I do everything from my heart.
I treat everyone as my kin.
And people love me too.
That's why they are my family.
The doll says, the doll says
it again that you are prince
The doll says, the doll says
it again that you are prince
Luck comes only once,but
Character remains forever.
We have only one sun and moon.
Likewise, we have only one King.
Play with it or topple it,It
never gives up and bows down.
The doll says, the doll says
it again that you are prince
Greatness lies in Simplicity.
