I can only sing this song...
to someone who understands it.
Let's hear it.
When you sing,
you laugh at the same time.
It must be because
you're winning too!
It's fun to sing...
and play a game at the same time.
Since your clothes are different,
take a look at mine.
If you show me yours, I'll...
No, I don't want any lessons
from some up-north stranger.
You don't know these designs.
My wife knows first-hand.
Tulimaq!
Take the children out.
Son...
Big boys
have to go out.
Oki, you too.
Go play with Amaqjuat.
I never had any brothers,
so I just adore little boys.
Some water you can keep warm.
Sister, if you ever need me...
Yes, I know you'll come
when I call for help in my heart.
Take my husband's rabbit's foot.
You'll need it
some day.
Tulimaq is the one
they'll go after now.
We never knew what he was,
or why it happened.
Evil came to us like Death.
It just happened,
and we had to live with it.
Here.
Be careful what you wish for.
You helped him
murder your own father!
Tulimaq is the one
they'll go after now.
Tulimaq! Their balls are too big!
Where's Tulimaq?
With those starving dogs.
Maybe he'll get home tomorrow!
Another bad day out there.
I broke my knife on a rock.
I'm sick of this bad luck.
Amaqjuat, come.
My big man,
how much I love you!
Atanarjuat is hungry too.
Atanarjuat, are you hungry?
Are you cold too?
Tulimaq!
Come get a little something
for your wife's empty belly.
Tulimaq, the great hunter!
Your share is the rear end,
as usual.
Maybe your wife's a better hunter?
You can stay home tomorrow
and do the cooking and sewing!
Daylight's getting longer.
- Hunting will be better soon.
- Good.
I'm sick of eating leftovers.
Especially the rear end.
Here, a piece of walrus heart.
Your sons need to eat more.
They will help us all some day.
Here, Amaqjuat. Eat.
When my sons grow up, I'll never
be treated like this again.
Amaqjuat, share with your brother.
You must never forget
to take care of Atanarjuat.
Atanarjuat, come on!
Amaqjuat, it's too heavy!
No wonder mother said
I should always take care of you.
If you want to lift a heavy rock,
think of it as a woman's butt.
Then you'll be able to lift it.
Look!
Oki's gang is walking again.
They lost their dogs.
Our dogs ran home.
I'm tired of walking.
We'll borrow yours.
Asshole.
Brother, run them down.
Taking a break?
Who's ''it''? Atanarjuat?
I'm the wolf!
I'm hungry for human skin!
Nobody can ever catch Atuat!
Except lovely Atanarjuat!
Maybe Atuat wants to be caught!
Especially when we play wolf
on the skin!
Ooh, Atanarjuat!
I ''wolf'' you.
You and your brother!
Don't forget,
Atuat is promised to me!
Brother!
If Atuat's your promised wife,
why aren't you married already?
Exactly! Atanarjuat's in my way!
Maybe you need your sister
to distract Atanarjuat first?
Pakak! Pittiulak!
Get him off me!
Amaqjuat is really strong!
You little...!
You're trying
to steal my promised wife!
Let's do it right now!
Oki...
Little Mother,
you're just as beautiful
as I remember you
when I was a child in your arms.
When I was your mother?
Was my namesake very beautiful?
Did you love me very much?
Of course!
That's why I named you Atuat!
I recognized you right away.
Little mother,
I don't want you
to marry my grandson, Oki.
He's a mean man,
like his father.
Ever since that stranger
murdered my husband...
evil lives in both of them!
How can I refuse Oki
when our fathers already agreed?
Next time, I'll break your neck!
What are you all looking at?
Haven't you ever seen anyone
kick a dog before?
Why's Oki so angry?
His dogs can't keep up with me.
He's fed up always running behind.
What?
What did you say?
Are you making fun of me?
If you think
you can laugh in my face,
I'll kill you!
When will that be?
My brother's a real jerk!
Dogteam!
Now it's the other brother.
Maybe more trouble?
My little son!
Wonderful!
Our igloo will never be cold.
With Atanarjuat,
my little son.
Wonderful!
Let me kiss my little boy!
Look at his heavy load!
Little man,
you took a long time!
Did the spirits
make you lose the trail?
We'll have lots of meat now!
Tomorrow...
Tomorrow, I'll make...
I'll make a feast!
Meat at our place!
Tulimaq has a good idea!
A big igloo
for games and a feast!
- What are you looking at?
- Me?
I'm looking at Atuat.
That's it!
You brothers think
you can do anything!
If you want Atuat,
you have to go through me first!
They're going to punch heads
for a woman?
Now someone will get hurt!
This one's no good.
Too small?
Atanarjuat! Something to drink?
Save your strength, you two!
Tonight you'll have your chance!
Maybe a little tighter?
Dogs are restless tonight.
Ready?
Imagine!
Oki thinks it's easy to kill me.
Did he say that?
Did he throw those words out loud?
Oki was out of control today.
A man who's serious about killing
would keep it to himself.
He said the words ''kill you''?
What are you going to do?
Now Oki can try it
any time he wants!
I don't even think about Oki.
You, you're never afraid.
But me...
Oki is a lot stronger than I am.
Instead of you, he'll kill me!
Oki, this isn't about you...
So you can just keep dancing.
- Finally we'll be in-laws!
- Of course!
That's been agreed.
- We waited a long time for this.
- Since our children were babies.
We'll have a great night tonight.
What's your problem now?!
I'm always clumsy.
It's me. I didn't see you.
Little Mother,
come and sit beside me.
Wife, sing my father's song.
A big man won't even
Bring home enough food.
If what's hanging
Between your thighs gets stiff,
Don't let it blast off!
Who blames his friends
For his empty bed?
Normal people do it
in the right place,
But you always get
in the wrong one.
Save your strength.
Tulimaq, you're smiling now.
Sitting on top of the hill.
But it's a long way down,
and he's just getting started.
Well, let's see those two
step into the centre!
If it's up,
Atanarjuat goes first.
If it's down,
Oki has the first blow.
Oki, you go first.
Husband,
the Evil One is here,
we need your help.
I'm the boss here!
Atuat's already promised to us!
My grandson bet for Atuat
by his own choice.
Little one!
Now you're getting somewhere!
Oki, finally
you're made weightless!
This bedrock,
Cool and smooth,
When it split
and I stepped out,
Were you
as shocked as I to see?
Here at the river,
Here, where it narrows,
That strange voice
singing in the wind
Don't you keep on
hearing me?
When I whistled
That same tune,
Were you the one
Who whistled back
from that hill-top far away?
You in there! Don't you know
your brother's coming in?
Tulimaq!
Atanarjuat is coming in.
What a day!
Tired?
No, just overheated.
What a beautiful day!
It was amazing out there!
How're you feeling?
I was feeling tired all day.
It's getting hard
to walk around now.
No wonder!
Your belly is really big now!
Do I look as big as I feel?
Let's have a listen.
He just kicked me!
He's a good little kicker!
Can you really hear it?
- You caught a nice seal!
- Yes, I got a good one.
Out by the floating ice.
I saw a lot of them.
- The wind is changing fast.
- Yes, it already turned around.
South wind will be stormy now.
Walrus are coming early this year.
Amaqjuat, I need you here
to help me with the hunt.
Your brother will have to go
caribou hunting
without you this year.
You, all alone out there?
In my time,
men needed to have two wives.
First wives didn't always like it
when they got left behind.
Don't look at my wife, brother.
You better find somebody else!
Hey, you're in luck!
There's an extra family
in Sauri's camp!
They're right on your road!
Are you serious?
Sauri's camp?
A man with a big nose!
He has two daughters with him
and they're both really ugly!
Maybe you can borrow one?
Puja! Working hard?
My goodness!
Why is water so heavy?
Atanarjuat.
And he's all alone.
Are you walking to us?
What a surprise!
Welcome!
Come eat with us!
You must be tired.
Atanarjuat, meet my new wife!
Me too! I married her sister!
What do you think about that?
Good for you.
Welcome to my camp!
I'm happy to see you!
You'll rest with us for a while.
How's my little mother, Atuat?
Father, let's make a feast for him!
Delicious!
Take a lot.
Don't be shy.
Yes, we just came in with meat.
We saw caribou
all over the place up there!
But the ground is very rough.
My boots needed lots of new soles.
You better have extras.
I used up two pairs!
Where's your wife?
She's too pregnant this year.
You're not going alone?
Sister, you were sad this year
to stay behind with Grandmother.
If Atanarjuat needs help,
why don't you go with him?
My clothes are all new.
I'm sure I'll be okay.
Not for long!
The caribou are very far.
Oh, yes, they're far.
Really far.
I don't mind if she goes along,
even if she is our best worker.
So it's settled.
Daughter, pack and get ready.
I'm always ready, father.
My small tent is perfect for two.
I'll lend it to you.
You'll see.
You're drinking it all yourself?
My turn.
Come on!
Wait! I'm really thirsty.
It's dirty.
Now, you carry it.
That will keep us warm enough.
I'm already chilled.
You left the door wide open.
Maybe you want me
sleeping close to you tonight?
I'll close the door properly.
Well, close it, then.
I don't want to be cold tonight.
Are you always cold?
I've been chilled
since I was up there picking.
Let me warm up a little.
That's cold!
You know the best way
to warm up fast here?
How?
I'll show you the best way.
Here, give me your hand.
How hard for us
To find a lover
But through this dream
between our worlds
Now, we've finally
found each other.
I lost my voice.
Now if I sleep,
maybe I'll find it in my dream.
Am I in your dream too?
You?
Are you in my... Listen!
What is it?
What is it?
That little bird...
Sounds like crying.
It's smaller than a loon.
We used to see them a lot.
Creepy.
You never know what's out there.
Hey, you dirty...
I'm cold!
Now I really have chills.
I'm chilled.
I'm going to the tent.
Are your hands cold?
Yes, I'm cold.
Give me your hands.
That wasn't good enough.
I'll warm you like this:
Is that better now?
Kumaglaq! Come, little one!
You're always so clumsy, Atuat.
You can clean up the tent
while I take my walk.
We're all so quiet lately.
What's wrong with us?
Why isn't Puja eating with us?
Husband,
you know
I don't usually complain,
but Puja is not helping us.
It's spring,
and we do all the work.
She's bossy and lazy
whenever you're not around.
I'm very unhappy about it.
Being all stuck in one tent
might bother some of us,
but if Puja's not sleeping,
she's just walking around.
What's she doing out there?
Fucking with spirits?
Brother...
What do you think
about all this?
I don't think anything about it.
They're your wives.
It's none of my business.
Too much talk spoils my appetite.
Not you, older brother!
Mother!
I didn't do anything!
My husband tried to kill me!
I didn't do anything!
I never
saw him like that before!
I expected something like this.
He thinks he can do anything.
I should've killed him
when I was thinking about it.
If you didn't just think about it,
this never would have happened.
Besides,
Amaqjuat's the one to watch.
I'm not afraid of Amaqjuat!
You bark better than you bite.
Don't worry, sister.
They'll never do this to you again.
Father, he wanted to kill me!
There won't be any killing.
At least not you, anyway.
Don't worry too much, Uluriaq.
Your husband didn't know
what he was doing.
Puja's a witch.
I'm not thinking about myself.
It's Atanarjuat.
He loves his brother
and he looked so hurt.
Did you see them leaving today?
I saw them.
They didn't say
a word to each other.
Atanarjuat wouldn't look at him.
What are we going to do?
How will we all live together?
I can't believe it.
What's she up to now?
It's me!
I'm the one!
It's all my fault!
I'm so sorry!
I'll never do
anything like that again!
If you let me come home,
I'll do all the work around here.
Until you can forgive me.
How could you
make love to my husband?
Your brother-in-law! You're not
even supposed to talk to him!
That's how
you break up the family!
I thought we loved our in-laws
in our heart,
not our bed!
Do anything to me!
Beat me if you want!
What happened is past.
Let's try to be a family again.
Thank you!
I'll be good from now on!
Atuat, I'll clean that skin now.
I'll go check on Kumaglaq.
What are you doing back here?
Get the hell out of here!
That's enough!
We already made up with her.
Puja is sorry.
She's our family
and we forgive her.
Have pity on her.
Husband...
Dear one...
If I can forgive Puja,
those who love you
can forgive you too.
I've been awake for so long,
I feel like I could sleep
all the way to next summer.
Listen...
I'll dry the men's clothes
while you two go egg-picking.
It's a beautiful day for a walk.
I'll catch up later.
Good idea.
- Shall we go?
- Sure. See you later.
Remember that time
hunting walrus on thin ice?
Oki's gang was so scared,
I think Pakak pissed his pants!
We had fun in those days,
remember?
Little brother,
my wife is finally pregnant.
I wish for a son,
a fast runner like you.
Brother, I've been thinking...
I was wrong between us.
I hope you can forgive me.
