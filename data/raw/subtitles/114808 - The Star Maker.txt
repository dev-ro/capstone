Talk.
I saw a skull atop a cannon.
Was curious and questioned it.
He answered...
with great sadness...
"I died to no bells tolling.
"My years escaped me...
"escaped I know not where.
"And now that I am eighty...
"I call the living,
and the dead respond.
"Prepare my bed...
"as worms have already
begun to eat me.
"I want to be buried
with respect...
"and with red flowers...
"yellow flowers...
"and red."
Very good!
THE STARMAKER
Holy shit!
There's a dead man!
Didn't you see him?!
No.
Who could it be?
Who do you think
it could be?
A union man or
a policeman or a bandit.
Or one son of a bitch!
Hell of a face!
Citizens of Realzisa...
Universalia Studios of Rome

Remember, lady luck
only comes once!
Sometimes never!
Lice bring luck,

The question of manual labor...
is the main problem...
of Realzisa's farmers.
Mayor, you can't keep playing
with loaded dice!
Put the order of the day of our
party and the workers to vote.
All right!
Let's see who's right
and who's wrong!
In favor?
Against?
Two in favor...
thirteen against,
rejected by the Council!
City space
and electrical hook-up.
What a face!
You have a fantastic future.
And you don't even know it!
Citizens of Realzisa!
Universalia Studios of Rome...
invites you to participate
in the hunt...
for " New Faces
in the Movies"!
New face for the cinema!
Men, women, young and old,
success can be yours!
With a simple screen test,
our producers...
can offer you
the career of a lifetime!
Do you know how much
an actor can make?
Do you know?
A hundred million annually!
Joe Morelli here...
talent scout in Italy
and America.
Fasco Giachetti...
Annamaria Pietrangeli,
Lex Baxter.
Not to brag,
but I discovered them.
If not for me,
they'd still be washing floors!
You know Amedeo Nazzari?
Real name, Angelo Buffa.
From Sardegna.
And who says...
that a Sardinian can be a star
and a Sicilian can't?
Friends of Realzisa,
today nobody knows who you are.
But tomorrow...
your beautiful Sicilian faces...
will enhance...
Italian and foreign movies!
For a mere 1,500 lire...
just to reimburse expenses,
film and equipment...
your screen test...
will be seen by the best
directors of Rome!
Change your destiny!
A miracle awaits you.
Help lady luck out...
participate in our hunt for...
"New Faces in the Movies"!
If I'd been born beautiful,
I'd try out now.
Maybe Santina could try.
Santina's afraid
of her own shadow!
You know how much
an actor can make?
Millions! Millions! Millions!
People of Realzisa...
with a simple screen test...
our producers in Rome...
To look good in lights...
you have to darken the cheeks,
like this.
Otherwise they look swollen...
like you got a toothache.
If they make a movie
in Sicily...
they have your face
and you're on.
And you make 100, 200,
even 350,000 lire.
Sure, but you have
to know how to act.
Did you ever see
"Gone With The Wind"?
Yes.
Now I'll teach you
the last line in the movie.
"After all,
tomorrow is another day"?
Now that's talent!
She's good, she'll work!
I knew it, too.
Please, come in.
Why alone in there?
Because I'm shooting.
And when you shoot, there must
be complete silence...
total concentration.
Madam, don't ruin the make-up!
And those who want
to try their luck...
learn these two lines
from "Gone With The Wind."
Blue for men, pink for women.
Joe Morelli is here for you!
At your service!

Why?
He left me! He left me!
Like Rhett left Scarlet!
He went north!
What do I tell them at home?
Did you go...
all the way?
Yes!
Jesus Christ!
Listen.
Listen, cry quietly.
You have what it takes.
Maybe a month or two and you'll
be in Rome, Cinecitta'
So I don't say anything.
Not a word, relax.
Yes, OK.
Scarlet, I've waited
longer for you...
than I've ever waited
for any woman.
Here's a soldier of the South
who loves you!
Wants to carry the memory
of your kisses...
into battle with him.
Kiss me!
Tara, home, I'll go home!
And I'll think of some way
to get him back.
After all, every day
is another Sunday.
What's this " Sunday
and Saturday," idiot!
It's like this: " After all,
every day is like the other."
Try again.
Dear Scarlet, though I go
to meet my death...
you're angry with me.
No, moron!
Scarlet, do we have to wait till
I'm out of the army to kiss?
Even if you don't want it,
Scarlet...
sooner or later,
you'll be mine.
I'm from the South,
and not even death can stop me!
Kiss me!
How was that?
If I were Scarlet,
I'd have married you already!
Scarlet, I have
waited for you...
with a patience
that surprises even me.
I'm a soldier of the South,
and I love you.
He's a soldier off to war
and wants a kiss.
She says that, " After all,
tomorrow is another day."
What did she say?
That " After all,
tomorrow is another day."
'Course tomorrow is another day!
What a discovery!
She, Scarlet, says to him...
"Don't be bitter, the sun
will rise again after all...
"and besides,
what's the rush?"
And the man says...
"Enough small talk, Scarlet!
"Nothing yesterday,
nothing today...
"nothing tomorrow,
nothing the day after.
"Enough, Scarlet, I can't take
any more, I can't go on.
"Give it to me, Scarlet...
"I beg you, give it to me!
"If you don't...
"go rot far from my sight!"
And Scarlet says...
"This you shouldn't have said.
"Coward! Louse!
"Thank God I'm a woman...
"or I'd have fixed your face!"
Celery! Mint!
Parsley!
Basil!
Pardon me, what's this do?
Pull people in?
Pulls them in, that's right.
My grandson, Filippo,
best looking boy in town...
like me at his age.
Make him like Rudolph Valentino,
I'll make it worth your while.
I can't promise anything.
Movies are a mean business.
I don't want
to disappoint anybody.
But I've got
19 years' experience...
and one thing's for sure...
if there's talent
behind this face...
not even God can stop him.
There is, there is!

We're sorry, Mr. Morelli.
We don't remember the words.
That's OK.
Say something else,
about your family.
We can't say much
about our family.
Just that our parents
got married in 1923.
A year later,
I was born on February 18.
The year after another brother,
who we called Benito.
In January 1925, our parents
made another brother...
who we called Francesco.
- In June 1927...
- '26.
'26, our parents
made another brother...
called Calogero.
How many brothers
did they make?
- Eighteen brothers.
- And one sister.
A nun to the fountain did go,
a monk he did go after.
The wind blew up her tunic.
What a white ass
she had on her!

After all,
tomorrow is another day.
Should I do the music, too?
Scarlet, one way or other
you'll be mine.
You can't resist me.
Because the way
I please a woman, no lie...
nobody else comes close.
Modestly speaking, with me...

Nobody'll understand that!
Modestly speaking, with me...

People of Sicily...
you feel the change
in the air...
you know the days
of humiliation are over.
You feel that it's a new day.
You know things in Italy
have improved!
We are no longer ashamed
of being Italians!
We are proud of it!
Can it out there!
Haven't you had enough yet?
Don't let them bug you,
Cavalier.
...wants to carry

- Kiss me!
- Excellent!
Now, say it happily.
I'm sorry. I don't know
how to be happy.
Anna, show Dr. Morelli
what nice legs you have.
Don't move.
Turn around.
Turn around, sweetheart!
Good girl, like that.
You see? Not because
she's my daughter...
but she's far nicer...
than some of those dancers
who make you sick.
Stop.
Very good.
- What's this?
- Receipt.
A receipt?
Wait outside.
The girl's got it,
she's good...
expressive...
she has a nice figure.
I'll see what I can do,
put in a good word, but...
understand? No promises.
This is the receipt.
You keep it.
In a month
you'll hear from Rome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
1,500 lire.
I don't have a lira.
I'm a serious professional.
You don't play around with me.
My husband's been in jail
for 11 months and 8 days.
When's he get out?
Don't ask.
So who's gonna pay my expenses?
Could I be an actor?
Really?
And aren't I just the man
to make movies?
But watch out!
Movies aren't for everybody.
But all you need
is one man in, making money...
and everybody makes it big.
- Like emigration?
- Exactly.
For example, one of you goes
to America, gets rich...
sends money home,
and buys a piece of land.
Then he's gotta build a house,
so he needs some workmen.
Who does he call? You!
He calls you and you.
It's a circle, a chain.
Check, please.
Excuse me...
but it's gotten late,
and I've got work to do.
Thank you, Mr. Morelli.
It's been an honor.
Dinner's on the house.
Thank you.
You'd be a sure-shot
in the movies... look!
With this face like
a Roman emperor!
You deserve a free screen test!
Will the King be back?
The King, will he come back?
Take her.
Take her!
Take my little girl!
I don't want her
to end up like me.
She's got to make it!
I tried once, in Palermo.
They were making a movie
about pirates.
I was young...
they took me.
But I never got to act.
Pricks were all I saw!
But not like yours.
Yours is nice.
What could I do? People talk.
I ran away...
to an uncle who touched me
since I was small.
How disgusting!
But he married me.
Shut up, you whore!
Turn around!
OK, whatever you want.
Break me apart!
Break me apart!
But take my little girl.
I'll let you be her first.
What's this guy want?
Registration and license.
- I'm with Universalia.
- I know.
What's up, Brigadier?
Listen, Morelli...
where and when do you develop
the screen tests you shoot?
You know something
about movies?
Precisely.
What a pleasure to talk
to somebody competent!
I send the negatives
to Rome each week...
and my colleague,
Dr. Mario Cotone...
has it developed and printed.
And then?
Then, after they make
a first selection...
the material is given
to producers, directors, who...
Who what?
Who make movies.
Even De Sica?
Of course, heck, De Sica...
I've even got an autographed
picture of Vittorio, see?
Yes.
Look.
Here, I represent the law.
I don't doubt it,
but how do I fit in?
And nobody must know!
Brigadier Mastropaolo, take 27.
Through me it leads
to the city sorrowful.
Through me it leads
to the eternal pain.
Through me it leads
among lost people.
All your distrust
must be abandoned here.
Here and now all cowardice
must be ended.
We have come to the place
I told you to expect...
where you would see
that people in their sorrow...
who have forfeited
the good of intellect.
"The Inferno,"
by Dante Alighieri.
I translated it into Sicilian.
I'm also translating
Shakespeare's "Othello."
Fantastic, Brigadier!
Say something in Italian, too,
spontaneous, from the heart.
Dear Rossellini, Visconti...
dear De Sica...
I'm a policeman only because
my father was a policeman...
but I swear,
this is not the life for me.
I want to aim higher...
but here, what can I aim for?
More likely one day
a bandit will take aim...
and it's good-bye,
Michele Mastropaolo.
Stop.
Brigadier, I'm speechless.
I've got tears in my eyes!
Hell of a place,
this shit-hole Sicily.
Just a few Indians,
we could make a western.
Go on, move it!
Move it!
What do you want from me?
Stash that prick, asshole!
Hand over your money!
I'm just a worker.
I'm in the movies.
Strip!
You pick on
poor buggers like me?
From the mainland?
Yes, Rome.
All thieves...
you've taken all we have.
I can tell.
No jokes! What's in the truck?
What truck? Oh, nothing.
What's in the truck?
Mother of God, what faces!
What eyes! You brothers?
Why, it shows?
Hand over your money
or it's a bullet in the head.
You're sitting on a gold mine,
and you don't even know it!
What luck, what a career!
Your money.
What money? I'm talking riches!
Give us your money!
No, I mean riches, wealth!
Dollars, understand?
- Dollars? Money!
- It's the same thing.
Dollars are money?
We're sitting on a gold mine?
Understand?

Talk.
- What do we say?
- Make something up.
Anything, fake it.
I can make up that we're
seven Badalamenti brothers.
The first, Michelangelo,
died when the Germans bombed.
Another, Giovanni,
died when the Americans bombed.
Mariano, killed by the mafia.
We found him in a hay stack
with his head bashed in.
The littlest, Giacomino,
killed by the police.
We three are still alive.
Everybody hates us.
Mafia, church, cops,
monarchists...
fascists, socialists,
separatists...
democrats, communists,
and liberals.
Everybody.
Almost everybody.
But we know
what we have to do.
We have to slit their throats.
We've killed 45 so far...
and that's just a start,
Dr. Morelli!
Stop! What imagination!
Imagination, my ass!
That's the holy truth!
You tell them in Rome,
if they need to film...
a shoot-out, killing,
or murder...
nobody does it
like the Badalamenti do!
Brothers, to a new life!
Dr. Morelli,
God will see to you.
No, no.
- What do you mean, no?
- You don't get it.
You have to pay me.
I'll give you a discount,
three thousand lire total.
We don't take anything...
don't even stab you,
and you still want money?
It costs to develop film,
and I don't have a lira.
Like this,
the test's not worth shit.
Anyway, you want to shoot me?
Shoot.
Number 46 is fine with me.
But you'll be outlaws for life.
Brothers.
Maybe Dr. Morelli is right.
Bread is bread.
However,
you're out 1,500 lire...
and we're out 1,500 lire.
Pay up, boys.
Morelli, good man,
you did it again!
You're just like the Phoenix,
forever being reborn!

You're free to say

I'm a shepherd, I can say that.
Perfect!
Talk about shepherding.
The best thing about
being a shepherd...
is that you can reason
with the stars.
City people never look
at the stars.
But shepherds, in the country,
at night, it's different.
Sometimes I look at the stars
and reason.
Does the world really exist?
I don't think the world exists,
it's just pretend.
I think that when I look
at a dead rabbit, too...
the eyes always look alive...
and they watch me,
like when I look at a picture.
I saw a picture once.
And wherever I went...
the picture was always
looking at me.
Cottone, take one!
I'll talk about
September 8, 1943...
Armistice Day.
I was in Serbinico,
in Dalmatia.
There were sixty of us sailors.
Suddenly, September 10,
Germans landed on the battery.
13 of my companions escaped...
and they were
going to shoot 13 of us.
They lined us up...
machine guns pointed
to kill us all.
They asked if we'd fight
at their side...
and we all said "no!"
Lo Coco, take one.
The first time I ate meat
I was 23.
My life is work, nothing else.
I hoe and embroider.
My hands look sixty...
but I'll be thirty in May.
No one will marry me...
because they say
I slept with Americans.
It's not true; even shit
has a right to speak!
My mother washed
soldiers' clothes...
and when they came,
they smiled at me...
"very good, pretty girl."
Once I was alone...
and an American came
for his uniform.
"You very nice girl,"
he said, "I love you."
And put his hand
between my legs.
I ran. Nothing happened.
But nobody believes me because
when the Americans left...
that one gave the priest...
an envelope
full of dollars for me.
Shut up, you're making her cry!
I made my own dowry,
eight sheets...
6 tablecloths for 12
and 6 for 6 with embroidery.
Let's see how gallant
my countrymen are!
Stop!
Do you want to be an actress
or find a husband?
One or the other, just so's
I get out of this shit-hole.
"After all,
tomorrow is another day."
Who is that?
Only one who minds
his own business.
Nobody's ever heard him say
a word, but he knows a lot.
- Too bad he's old!
- He's mute!
Why, you'd have
married him otherwise?
It's Uncle Leonardo! Hurry!
Careful of the equipment!
Do a screen test
for Uncle Leonard! He's 112!
This way we'll remember him.
He was one of Garibaldi's
Thousand Men!
We all pitched in.
Come on, film him!
Doesn't he look great?
Uncle Leonardo?
Uncle Leonardo?
Uncle Leonardo?
- Uncle Leonardo?
- Huh?
What did Garibaldi say
to Nino Bixio?
"We'll hang the last king with
the guts of the last Pope."
Stop.
Is he mute?
No, he can talk.
He used to be a professor.
Went to war
and when he got back...
didn't speak again.
- Why?
- Nobody knows.
But he's nice. Don't be afraid.
Here.
Take this, you can go now.
Joe, are you leaving tomorrow?
- Yes.
- And we won't see you again?
Who knows?
Oh, Fifth!
Oh, Fifth!
Oh, Fifth Regiment!
Oh, Fifth Regiment of my life!
Oh, Fifth Regiment of my death!
July 18...
in the courtyard
of a convent...
the people of Madrid
joined the Fifth Regiment.
With Lister
and the Campesino...
with Galon and Modesto...
with Commander Carlos...
no militiaman is afraid.
Courage, let's go!
Machine guns crackle.
And Franco can go to hell.
And with the four battalions...
Defending Madrid...
the best of Spain unites...
the reddest flower
of the people.
With the Fifth, Fifth, Fifth...
with the Fifth Regiment...
Mother, I am going

Courage, let's go!
Machine guns crackle.
And Franco can go to hell.
How's that for a mute?
People here are nuts!
Nobody can save them.
Spanish, that's sure enough.
What a mess!
What could he have said:
Look at this.
Mixed salad.
Spaniard, you, too...
are in this mess
with all the others.
Then, when they start to cry...
they're really
a pain in the butt!
Good night.
Animals!
Dumb beasts and rednecks!
Wouldn't they all like
to be in the movies?
I'd like it, too.
If I only knew the fuck how!
Good morning. I'm Dr. Mistetta.
Got a bad case in St. Vincenzo.
- Would you give me a lift?
- Certainly. Climb in.
Thank you.
Unfortunately,
it happens at all hours.
When a job's a calling...
She's a missionary, too.
Look at her!
She arrives from Palermo
every Tuesday.
Bachelors, farmers, miners...
they wait all week.
She comes and in one night
takes them all.
Next day she's off
and by evening...
she starts again
in some other town.
Poor guys!
Yes, poor and deceived,
deceived by all.
By God, by the State,
by men.
And if you allow me,
also by you, Dr. Morelli.
What do you mean, Doctor?
I'm a serious professional.
I know you're a professional
in the movies.
I don't mean to offend you...
but from a moral and social
point of view...
do you think it's right to
promise them riches and glory...
these poor folks
who need work, bread...
peace, progress, justice?
Dr. Morelli,
we'll meet in Rome!
Six months,
we'll kill them all...
then the Badalamenti
brothers will escape!
They might all be poor
and deceived...
but since I've been here all
I've met are nuts like those...
outlaws, fanatics, cops...
criminals, spies,
revolutionaries...
and they're never still!
Always something going on,
something up their sleeve!
What is Sicily?
A boiling, bubbling pot...
and who knows why?!
You tell me why!
Dear friend...
we always understand things
when it's too late.
I don't know what's boiling
in the pot...
but I don't want
a handful of men...
including those who
sell dreams, like you...
to be planning a party
for the select few.
You aim to kill us?!
Wasn't your patient
seriously ill?
Go slow.
The poor man's going

Looks like we can forget it.
No, I have to issue
a death certificate.
Otherwise
nobody will pay me.

Good God, there's make-up

If I disgust you, tell me.
I'm used to it.
I won't be offended.
It's not a question of disgust.
Actors like you...

Hmm?

But they don't let on.
Really? Should I go, then?
It's no go. Save your money.
I'm only hurting myself,

Wait, wait, wait!

"Vito, pointed-end sideburns,

Vituzzo does it.
Vituzzo's good.
But as soon as he glances

They whistle at you

call you names...
They tease.
I want to leave.
I want to go.
Thank goodness
I met you, Dr. Morelli.
It's lucky for me!
Look, I didn't
promise anything.
No, Dr. Morelli.
You've made me understand.
There's a world
far from here...

Stop.
Good! Excellent recitation!

Where to? To do what?
Let me give you a receipt.

Mind your own business!

Yes... what?!

What do you want, dummy?
Did you do the cleaning?
Give me 1,500 lire.
What do you need to buy,
an evening dress?
When I clean,
you give me 300.
100 is tip because
you show me your tits.
OK.
If you show me everything...
All naked?
All or nothing.
No.
Hurry!
Tomorrow's the last day!
Everything.
Start.
First the money.
They call you a dummy...
but you're one smart pussy.
Come here.
Slowly, slowly.
Everything.
Jesus Christ, you're a statue!
Turn around.
I want to screw you! How much?
Pig!
The show's over.
Wash your hands first.
The hungrier they are...
the more they act like shit,
these beggars.
Beata, take one.
Do I show my profiles?
Yes.
Right.
Left.
Center.
Why such a religious name?
Couldn't your parents
think of another?
I'm the Virgin Mary's daughter.
I was born in the convent.
Got it. How old are you?
I don't know, 15 or 18.
I don't remember how old.
I can only count to ten.
Boyfriend, husband, relatives?
Nobody. I sleep in the convent.
How did you get the money?
From Don Gino, the tax man.
He eyed me naked and paid.
Eyed you?
What do you mean eyed you?
He looked at me.
He saw you naked?
He forced you.
No, I wash floors...
houses, stores.
I bathe the sick
and when they pay me...
they ask to look at me...
my legs or breasts...
all of me, but I never
let them touch.
Why didn't you let me
look at you...
if you didn't have the money?
Your kind sir did not ask!
Your kind sir did not ask!
Look the way you would
if afraid.
- Afraid?
- Yes.
And you want to be an actress?
If your kind sir
would help me, yes.
After all,
tomorrow is another day.
What kind of movies
do you like?
I like love stories...
where everybody kisses
and are happy ever after.
Would you know how to do
a nice love scene?
Stop.
That's it?!
That's it.
What do you want...
"The Charge of the Light
Brigade" right off the bat?
Anyway, you're photogenic.
What's that mean?
That you're pretty.
You can be pretty.
You've got a basket of hair!
On film...
you can be beautiful.
I mean it.
Ugh. No.
What's wrong?
I tell you what's wrong.
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry.
Hold it.
Wait, I'll shoot a bit more.
What am I doing?
Beat it. There's no need.
You mean I'm no good?
You're wonderful.
Now scram.
Don't you want the money?
Beat it!
In a month you'll hear
from Rome. Scram!
Thank you very much.
She's beautiful!
You're so beautiful!
Beata, you know
you're a beauty?
When will you come
to the theater?
Hurry, it's a long way!
We heard what happened!
Dr. Morelli?
If you'd allow us
to ask a favor.
Pardon, make way.
A great man of honor.
The greatest!
Don Mariano Guarnero,
when alive...
never allowed photographs.
Not even a portrait left us.
You alone receive this honor.
But I don't take pictures.
I make movies.
- Can't we see them?
- Yes.
Well then, for God's sakes
carry on! Hurry!
Should I do
the relatives, too?
Never!
Only him. Him alone.
His face, his body.
From close, from far.
Him alone. Only him.
Come now, everybody up!
Donna Maria,
we'll come back after.
He seems to be sleeping.
Not enough light.
Can't we open a bit?
He'll come out ugly
like this.
Camera!
What a face. Holy shit.
This is the best movie...
you'll ever make in your life.
How much for your trouble?
Up to you.
When it's ready, send it
to the Mayor of Scaridizzi...
marked "personal,"
sealed with wax, remember.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
What a huge loss! What a loss!
Don't tell me.
Dr. Morelli!
Come, sit here.
Play a round with us.
Half-hour
and you'll be in bed.
Something light.
Let's see.
Flush.
Not even a full wins!
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
May I offer you a last chance?
"Play a round!"
I'll show you a round!
May I offer you
a last chance?!
What are you doing here?
Your kind sir told me...
that I was photographic.
- Get out! Scram!
- I'll go with you to Rome!
This way I won't wait a month
to become an actress!
Go on home!
I promise, no bother!
I'll help, wash up!
I'll cook.
Your kind sir is alone.
Beat it home!
What do you care I'm alone?!
If your kind sir wishes,
I'll let you look.
Are you crazy?
And I'll draw your milk.
Shame on you!
Start like this,
it's not acting you'll do!
Forgive me. I mean no harm.
If you're meant to be
an actress you will be.
If not, a milkmaid.
Eh?
Don't do that again.
Will you take me
to Rome, then?
You don't think I will?
You've got Joe Morelli's word.
If the test is good...
and it is, because I say so...
I'll come back and get you.
Get out here. It's better
if they don't see us together.
- Embarrassed?
- The way you talk! Senseless!
Give me a kiss.
I could be your uncle.
Beat it.
As you wish.
Go on, I'll make you
a great actress.
I'll come for you
in a Cadillac!
Some virgin's daughter!
This little orphan likes cocks!
Come back soon!
Yes.
I'll wait!
Wait, wait!
I'll do what
your kind sir wishes!
- Don't worry!
- Don't leave me here!
I'm an idiot. I'm too good.
I could have given her a go!
Open up! It's me!
Stop it and go!
It's better for you!
Mother Superior,
where should I go?
Go with the movie man,
shameless girl!
Goddamn truck!
Now you give up?!
Totally wrecked!
Fuck you and all Fiat!
Do you need help, sir?
Excuse me, Madame,
where are we going?
There's nobody here!
Don't worry.
Antonio will fix your car!
I see, but who's...
What's with
this fucking music?
Antonio, Mr. Morelli's
truck, please.
Excuse my asking...
but who's that?
The Prince of Montejuso,
my husband.
I'm sorry.
This town is his. Once a month
he comes and stays all day.
The rest of the time he never
leaves the Montejuso castle.
Nice piece of meat.
Noble, maybe,
but you never know.
Antonio, when do you think
it'll be ready?
In a couple of hours.
Mr. Morelli?
Yes?
I spoke with my husband...
and I'd like you to dine with us
at the castle tonight.
Tonight, actually...
I have to leave now.
Too bad.
Bon voyage, then.
You've traveled much.
It's lovely to travel.
You haven't traveled
in a long time?
Unfortunately.
You really met all these women?
Yes.
What's Rita Hayworth like?
Tall.
You're not from here,
are you?
How long have you
been married?
Stay with us.
I'll answer
all your questions.
But the Prince...
The Prince of Montejuso
take one!
Prince, say something!
Please, Prince.
Prince.
Have a drink, to my health.
Pardon... who are you?
A metteur-en-scene?
This is the new aristocracy!
Movies, charlatans.
My wife and I are proud...
to have never set foot
in a movie theater.
No, Prince.
I'm not in the movies.
I'm just a talent scout.
Hard work.
You can understand.
You're rich.
Yes, this is all mine.
It was all mine.
The war destroyed everything.
They made mincemeat
out of Sicily...
and out of my patrimony.
All I have left is her.
My only joy...
and my illusions.
This is where the last
of my funds ended up.
You won't believe it...
since nobody
has ever believed it.
I bought this
from a Finnish architect.
A genius!
I wanted to build
the Messina bridge...
across the strait...
uniting Sicily with Italy.
But all I found were closed
doors, ignorance, and mistrust.
The dream of the century,
but no one wanted to do it.
Only one thing
can be done: this!
You out of your mind?
Damn. It never works!
- Is Messina far?
- Not that far, little girl.
But I stop in Mussari.
Why off to Rome?
- To find my boyfriend.
- Lucky man!
Joe! Joe!
Joe!
Wait!
Joe!
Wait, Joe!
Wait!
It's me!
Joe!
What do you need, child?
What's this, a joke?
Motherfuckers, thieves,
assholes, bandits, sluts...
bastards, beggars...
whores, hustlers!
Where the hell are you?
Help!
Good to have Joe Morelli here...
everybody licking his balls!
Now that Joe Morelli needs help,
where the fuck are you?
Learn some manners,
sons of bitches!
Goddamn you all!
Look what pretty mines
there are!
They're very famous.
The countryside is fantastic.
I've got to take some pictures.
I want to take his picture, too.
What an interesting face.
Nice face.
Take his picture.
What are you doing?
A report on Sicilians.
Hell do I care?
I'm not Sicilian. I'm Roman.
You've got an interesting face.
Then take my cock!
These Sicilians
are all quick to anger.
Why are you talking?
Am I talking to you?!
Dr. Morelli!
This, too?
It's destiny, you know.
Destiny, Dr. Morelli.
- Where are you going?
- Mussari.
Ah, Mussari.
Thanks to you...
I found the courage to leave.
Know where I'm going? Messina!
And from there to Busto Arsizio!
Nice!
One can't stay here.
See that man back there?
Look at him. Look at him.
It's Bonocore, the clerk
in City Hall, in Realziso.
He had a mongoloid son.
25 years of martyrdom,
poor guy!
Yesterday he woke up,
gave the boy a kiss...
and shot him in the mouth.
Now they'll say he's crazy!
What is it, Mr. Morelli?
Has something been taken?
No. Nothing's missing.
It's just I'm a little tired.
Better this way.
The police knew at once
who did it.
Fraud experts.
Nothing like you!
You wouldn't believe it...
but they've made tons of money
out of bombed ruins...
the Prince and Princess!
But we've never managed
to catch them.
If it weren't for
the gas station attendant...
and your girlfriend...
Poor thing. They hurt her some.
Not badly though.
Joe!
More thieves?
Go on now. Clear out.
- It's forbidden to look?
- No looking and no touching!
We aren't thieves. We're with
the Christian Democrats.
Thieves and bandits!
- Now you're offensive!
- Says who?
Leave him be! My boyfriend
has a nervous fever!
Leave me alone!
Go away!
I was on my way
to Rome already.
To do what?
To look for you, your kind sir,
and be an actress.
Of all days!
I went to the police for you!
If it weren't for me...
your kind sir would have lost
the movie things!
They hit me!
And this is my thanks?
This is thanks for those...
who don't mind their
fucking business, got it?
What the fuck did I do
to deserve this?
Oh, stop it.
Dry your face.
Blow. Blow!
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
Don't you like it?
You don't know how to kiss?
I'll teach you?
You're so beautiful!
Your kind sir is, too.
Don't call me your kind sir.
You make me feel old.
Open up.
Open your legs.
I won't hurt you.
Be good. It won't hurt.
Like it?
People of Treportoni!
Universalia Studios of Rome...
extends its warmest
greetings...
to this beautiful land
of Sicily.
Men, women, young...
old, children, hurry!
Success awaits you!
Come out of your houses...
open your windows!
People here solved
the problem...
they all killed themselves.
- Look!
- What?
There's someone calling us.
Come here. They're all here!
Nobody's in the town.
Nobody's in the town.
They're all here!
Come on!
They're here!
There's nobody in town!
They're here.
What's this, a revolution?
Worse. They're taking back
the land!
Joe, film this!
Fishermen of Collemare...
your lucky day is here!
It's the movie man!
The miracle of riches!
Do you know how much
an actor can make?
One hundred million annually!
Calagero Destino, take one.
Right profile.
Left profile.
Center profile.
Action.
I'm a little nervous.
Don't worry.
You've got talent.
And when there's talent
behind the face...
there's no problem.
Relax.
Scarlet, I'm...
I'm nervous.
I'm a soldier of the south...
and not...
Go on, Calagero!
Pardon me, professor.
Stop the camera.
I peed in my pants.
It was nerves.
Come here. You have to pay.
You have to pay me.
The Marshal needs to see you.
It's not that the Marshal wants
to be in the movies, is it?
Tell him, soon as I'm finished
I'll let him try out.
Let's go. Who's next?
- You've already finished.
- Who is it?
Nice seeing you again,
Brigadier.
Marshal, please.
I've been promoted.
You, on the contrary, flunked.
Joe Morelli,
in the name of the law...
I declare you under arrest!
- You joking?
- Joe, what's happening?
Giuseppe Morelli, nee Romolo,
born in Albano August 18, 1913.
Convicted for theft,
breaking and entering...
fraud, armed robbery,
gambling...
seven years
and four months in jail...
emigrated illegally
to the United States in 1947...
deported for pimping...
subsequently hired
as equipment assistant...
Silence!
...for the production
of the film "Quo Vadis"...
and fired for the sale
of contraband cigarettes...
and drugs to the crew.
Get out of here!
Joe, don't leave me!
Joe! Joe!
Don't leave me!
Go away!
Universalia Studios
has never heard of you.
Your equipment has been
reported stolen...
and your lousy film, expired
who knows how many years ago.
Sign here.
Just between us two, Marshal...
We can talk better in private.
This is private,
for my screen test.
Did I ask you to try out?
You asked me to!
With respect, Morelli!
You asked me to, sir, OK,
like that?
It's true. You're right.
We're a sorry bunch:
girls, farmers, students...
and even policemen!
All someone has to do is promise
success and riches...
and we fall for it.
Send that girl on home.
She's OK.
She's not nothing to do
with this.
I'm a poor bugger.
I make me feel sorry for myself.
You're pitiful because
you're an idiot.
Taking advantage
'cause I'm in cuffs?
No, no.
Everybody confessed to you.
They gave you their soul...
and perhaps
they never will again.
And you didn't
understand a thing.
They trusted you, Morelli...
and so did I.
But all you wanted was money.
I thought your job was to look
for the truth...
not preach!
The truth!
People are more willing to tell
the truth before a camera...
than before a pair
of handcuffs!
But if the camera is empty...
eh, Morelli?
Marshal, take a look.
What do they want?
What's the deal?
Get out of the road. Hurry.
Greetings, Marshal.
A word with you.
Let's hear it.
You want to ruin me?
It's so hot!
Like summer's back.
Excellency, there's a bar
back there.
Come. Have an iced coffee?
But make it fast.
Get him!
Don't let him escape!
Make him cough his guts up!
Joe! Joe! Joe!
Leave him alone!
No!
Leave him alone!
No!
This'll teach you to play
with the honor of the dead!
Wake up! Open this gate!
Move it, Turiddu. I'm sleepy!
What a fucking drag!
Lucky for you
it was just two years, Joe!
Say hi to pussy for me, Joe!
Who do I give this to?
The storage man.
Good luck, Roman.
Thanks.
Did you let animals
sleep in my truck?
Why, you wanted rent paid?
He wants rent!
Have the one who slept
and ate in your truck...
for six months pay!
- Who?
- What was her name?
The actress!
What was your friend's name?
How do I know?
All she'd say was
the truck was hers.
She kept her mouth closed.
Closed? She kept it full!
May I help you?
Up until a couple
of years ago...
there used to be
a convent here.
The convent's gone.
Been more than a year now.
You stole my money!
What do you want?
Tomorrow's movie is even better.
Aren't you Dr. Morelli?
Yes, but I'm not a doctor.
What do you want?
I'm looking for Beata,
the convent girl.
The one who always used
to come here to the movies.
The virgin's daughter!
Who knows? She left when you...
anyway, since then
nobody's seen her.
- You have no idea where she is?
- None.
And even if I knew,
I certainly wouldn't tell you.
Why do I bother?
Look, I haven't got a lira.
Eat and be well, Mr. Morelli.
There's room enough in heaven
for us both.
Beata is where
the crazy people are.
Come in.
You are a friend of Joe's,
understand?
Don't cause any more trouble.
And thank the Director.
I wouldn't have let you see her.
Beata, it's Joe.
Joe is dead.
That's not true.
Look at me. It's me.
Take you with me?
Shall we go to Rome?
I've been to Rome...
years and years...
when I was rich...
and photogenic.
I had lots of rings...
necklaces, dresses...
an American car.
America!
Ha. That's all I needed!
My mansion...
had a bath that was too big.
Joe called it a swimming pool.
We traveled the world,
Joe and I.
Then they split us up...
and Joe died.
You're right...
I'm not Joe.
But...
I'm his best friend.
He sent me to you.
Do you have a cigarette?
You picked up a vice?
I'm glad.
It means you're getting better.
Would you like a cigarette?
Listen...
I talked to Joe before he died.
He asked me to look for you
to tell you something:
that you're the only woman...
that he's ever really loved.
He told me to tell you...
that when you were together
he didn't know...
because he's slow to catch on.
Poor Joe.
Joe was beautiful.
He was a son of a bitch,
Joe was.
Better if you never met.
Who knows how things will end?
That's enough. Go now.
Listen...
Listen good.
I'm going to look for work now.
But when I make some money,
I'll be back. I promise.
I'll get you the best of care.
Are you happy?
I'll get you well
and take you away.
If you like, we'll stay
together forever.
I'll take care of you.
Thank you.
They've escaped.
My years escaped me.
Escaped I know not where.
Now that I'm...
eighty...
I call the living
and the dead respond.
A nun to the fountain did go,
a monk he did go after.
The wind blew up her tunic.
What a white ass
she had on her!
After all, tomorrow...
tomorrow I'll kill myself!
Scarlet, do I have to wait
for furlough to have a kiss?
Our parents
got married in 1923.
A year later I was born
on February 18.
Mariano, killed by the mafia...
we found him in a hay stack
with his head bashed in.
After all,
tomorrow is another day.
Should I do the music, too?
They lined us up...
machine guns pointed
to kill us all.
They asked if we'd fight
at their side.
We all said "no!"
Here's a soldier of the south
who loves you.
Wants to carry the memory of...
your kisses into battle
with him.
Because the way I please
a woman, no lie...
nobody else comes close.
Modestly speaking, with me...
two shots and it's over!
We'll hang the last king
with the guts of the last Pope.
We three are still alive.
Everybody hates us:
mafia, church, cops,
monarchists, fascists...
socialists, separatists...
democrats, communists,
and liberals!
My hands look sixty...
but I'll be thirty in May.
No one will marry me...
because they say I slept
with Americans.
I'm sorry.
I don't know how to be happy.
Oh, Fifth Regiment of my life!
Fifth Regiment...
of my death!
We are no longer ashamed
of being Italians!
We are proud of it!
I wanted to build the Messina
bridge across the strait...
uniting Sicily with Italy.
But all I found were closed
doors, ignorance, and mistrust.
You would see that people
in their sorrow...
people have lost
their intellect.
I want to leave. I want to go!
Sometimes I look at the stars
and reason.
Does the world really exist?
I don't think the world exists.
It's just pretend.
I love stories...
where everybody kisses...
and are happy ever after.
