-Do you know what happened?
-Some kind of accident.
Those construction guys left
before the ambulance got here.
-Lites, right?
-Yeah. Two packs.
-Does that work?
-l hope so.
Whoa... good one.
-The card didn't go through.
-l'm sorry. Here, try this one.
No prob...
There we are.
You have a good one.
See ya.
See ya.
-Hey, good evening, Daisy.
-Hey, Luis, what happened?
They were working on
the electrical system today.
Junction box shorted out
as someone was working.
-Blew them out a 3rd floor window.
-Oh, my God. That's awful.
There is goes again.
The contractor quit...
-right after it happened.
-Do you know who it was?
Joe Sterling. The foreman.
An older gentleman.
The one who wore
the plaid shirts?
-That's him.
-Oh, he was a nice old man.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Steven!
Come on!
Daisy, it's Eva.
Your callback has been rescheduled
for Wednesday at three.
Wednesday at three. Okay?
God, l already changed
my shift twice.
Hi, Daisy. William here.
You never called me back.
l thought we could go hiking
at Angeles Crest this weekend.
Give me a call.
All right.
Are you aiming for Dante's
3rd or 4th circle of Hell?
-lt was just bad timing.
-Honey...
bad timing is
arriving late for dinner.
This is fire balling
a restaurant.
We moved in on
a crazy night, all right?
They haven't fixed the place yet.
That's all gonna change.
-l just don't like it.
-Honey...
Sorry to interrupt.
Remember me? l'm Byron
the building manager.
-Oh, yeah, of course.
-Hello!
Oh, this must be
your wife, Nell.
l just dropped by to say hello.
Just to welcome you guys.
lt's a bit of a shock with all the
hub-bub, emergency personnel, but...
we're really a quiet building.
Did l give you the storage keys?
We have them.
Well, l live in
the apartment below you guys.
Same apartment
Elizabeth Short lived in.
The Black Dahlia.
There's a lot of great old
history in this building.
lt's so old...
so much to...
Oh, do you want to see
the laundry room?
Look, our faucets are leaking,
like shooting out brown water.
And you said you were
going to replace our stove.
We'll get Ned right on it.
Any fixit problems you have,
just call Ned at extension 10.
He's our handyman around
the premises. No need to wait.
Shit.
-Need to take that? Should l...
-Hold on a minute.
There's also a problem
with the shower.
Uh... right. You know,
there's one really big plus.
You can always buzz Luis.
The doorman...
and have him call Ned.
Or let him know if somebody's
coming over, like this.
The vice chancellor will be here
at three for finger sandwiches.
-All right, Byron.
-lsn't that great?
There's not too many buildings
in this price range...
that offer the safety
and security of a doorman.
Well, that's something.
Can l show you guys
the outside?
l just want to show something
out in the hallway real quick.
This is really...
quite interesting.
Notice the unique architectural
designs that really...
adds to the ambience
of the building.
And we've got modern
amenities like the elevator.
Hey, guys.
Can you hold that for me?
Nice family. Good kid. You'll
meet 'em and get along great.
Feel right at home.
Must go. Gotta run.
No, really, we're a...
a very friendly building.
Welcome. Welcome!
Let's go. Thanks.
New people.
A teacher and a doctor.
-Our shower still doesn't work.
-Ned should take care of that.
Keys are in the kitchen,
l think.
Steven! Steven!
We need to break in
the apartment.
-You have not created the mood.
-Well, that can be arranged.
The neighbors...
-What now?
-Hang on.
Hold that thought.
-Do you like tea?
-l guess.
l'm cleaning out my kitchen
and l have all this tea.
Never opened.
l'll bring it over.
Great. Thank you.
l live next door. Saffron.
l'm Nell and this is...
Steven.
Hey, Luis?
Hans is coming over later.
-Got it.
-Mine's broken.
So... do you hear
all of the hammering?
-What?
-Late at night and never stops.
Sometimes l think that
it's stuck inside my head.
Hi, l'm Julia.
Hi, l'm Julia.
Austin.
Hand meet door.
No, it should be
alphabetical.
Philip, make sure
l have a spare set of hose.
-Yes, dear.
-Okay, well l gotta go.
-Did you leave school early?
-No.
Luis said you came home
at noon.
Honey. He doesn't have
afternoon classes.
Oh. Right.
So aren't you guys
going to be late?
Philip... l can't wear
black hose with this!
-You said...
-l didn't mean that.
What's all the hoopla about?
Oh, l'm working a cancer
society benefit.
l love cancer.
Look, don't stay up
so late, tonight. Okay?
Hello. No, l don't know...
Missed it!
Bullshit! You were
hanging all over her.
You fucking bitch. Always
going off about every thing...
l can't take care
of everything!
Why is everything
l do wrong?
You go around
like a bag lady.
Don't l get
enough drugs for you?
Why do you always leave me?
Why do you always leave me?
You're always leaving me.
Shout it!
-l love you!
-No, you don't.
l love you!
All this fucking hate.
l hate you! l hate you!
Get out of my house!
Are you leaving?
Are you going to come back?
l don't know
if l'm coming back.
Oh, God!
You're Ned, right?
l'm doing repairs.
Which way
is the laundry room?
Go back outside.
Make a left. You'll find it.
Hi, there. Any of
these washers free?
Come on in, don't mind me.
Just foldin' my skivvies.
That one will run hot, no
matter what you tell it to do.
Oh, really? Thanks.
You new here?
Yeah. My husband and l
just moved in tonight.
My name is Nell.
Charles Rooker.
Call me Chas.
You and your hubby actors?
No. He's just finishing up
med school...
and l am a teacher.
Stable. Honest.
That's good.
Too many pretty ones move here
and get their hearts broken.
They leave and make room
for another.
Good for you for
inculcating young minds.
Well, hopefully
l'll get ajob soon.
Steven's set though. He's got
a residency at the ER...
at the Wilshire Memorial.
How about you?
You lived here a long time?
Since '47.
Right after the War.
-You've lived here since 1947?
-And still on my feet.
Hell, l was here before
Jack Lusman disappeared.
-As in this building Lusman?
-Yep. He built it.
He wanted it to be a getaway
for all the movie stars...
who shared his proclivities.
But...they're fickle.
Discard one fad
and just embrace another.
You can't count on them
for anything.
lt didn't help that a lot of the
guys working construction here...
met a bad end.
What do you mean?
Luis? lt's Julia.
-Here you go. Catch!
-You're a lifesaver.
Hey, it's a full time job
with you, isn't it?
Always huffing and puffing and
running around in circles...
to get back
where you started?
One of these days l'm gonna
get you to come with me.
Oh, no. l'm a stand
in one place kind of a guy.
lt's working.
-Good night, Luis.
-Good night.
-Hi, Julia.
-Hello, Ned.
You've lost a lot of weight.
Fifty seven pounds.
l think you look pretty
at any size.
Thanks.
Stop it. No, you dick.
Get out!
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is it?
Ma'am, you just stay
right there.
Get out, motherfucker!
Get the fuck out.
Shut up and die,
motherfucker!
Police! Freeze!
What's going on here?
Byron's helping me run lines.
l have a callback. Look...
''Sweet Jesus,
what the fuck is that?''
''Shut up and bleed,
motherfucker!''
Mrs. Barrow, you should
take a look at this.
They were rehearsing.
Dude, this part is mine.
l'm so sorry. l really thought
something awful was happening.
That's okay. You were just
being a good neighbor.
Break a leg.
So those neighbors
were acting.
Yeah, they were actors.
How can you laugh at that?
l can't believe you.
Sweetie...
l'm laughing with you.
Am l laughing?
l don't think so.
We have to shell out
eighty bucks to fix that door.
That's a great story.
ln two days you'll be
calling your whole family.
-l'm sorry.
-No, it's all right, it's okay.
Jesus, these walls
are cardboard.
That's what l'm talking about.
lt's been like that all night.
You know what l'm going to do.
l'm gonna put up some acoustic tiles...
some baffling here.
Leave them alone.
They're finally making up.
Hey, honey, you want to
call the cops? Or should l?
Steven!
They aren't...
Yeah, they are.
Perhaps a family that lived
here a long time ago.
Maybe this is the way they
handled the tooth fairy.
Those are not children's teeth.
They have gold fillings in them.
The roots are still attached to
them like they were wrenched out.
Honey, no visuals.
Well, the building's
been here since the twenties.
l'd say from the look of the
box it's been here a long time.
A lot of black magic
uses various body parts.
The ancient Saxons built
whole temples out of bones.
Ned, go take care of the
damage in the Barrow's apartment.
-And dispose of the teeth.
-Yes, sir.
You said these renovations
would be a minor inconvenience.
They're not even happening and
yet we're living in a madhouse.
l've got to get some rest. And Nell
shouldn't have to put up with all...
Really, folks.
You know, l'm unsettled, too.
l mean teeth in the wall equals
weird, no question about it.
But it's just part of the
building's charm and character.
There's a lot of history here.
And you're part of it.
And by the way...
lf you break your lease...
you lose
your security deposit.
-We'll be okay without it.
-l don't think so.
This move set us back.
Steven, itjust
feels wrong here.
l can't get another
day off to move.
We'll have to wait till
the end of this rotation.
-Not now.
-l'll be back as soon as l can.
l'll figure this out.
l promise.
Hi, Julia.
Wait a second.
Come on...
The government
Seems so surreal
When sun and heat
ls all l feel
lt's a surrealistic summer
A surrealistic summer
As l sit here
Slowly waiting
l feel just like
A Dali painting
lt's a surrealistic summer
A surrealistic summer
As l sit here
Slowly waiting
l feel just like
A Dali painting
Come on!
Thank you.
Who the fuck are you?
My boyfriend's gonna be back any
minute. Get the fuck out of here.
Stay the fuck away
from me, you crazy fuck!
Somebody help me! Please!
Please help me! Please!
Please!
Oh, God!
She was screaming
and crying.
Please just check it out.
She another actress, Ma'am?
l would not call you
if l didn't...
Her boyfriend could have
beaten her. Or worse.
Saffron. You home?
Ma'am, l know you
mean well. Okay.
But this is your
second call in two days.
She and her boyfriend had a
horrible fightjust the other day.
Open it up.
-Ned, open the door.
-Yes, sir. Right away.
-Police!
-lt's Byron. Are you okay?
Stay here
please, gentlemen.
lt looks like
it usually does.
Saffron!
Just like l told you, Ma'am.
Nothing's going on in here.
-Nothing.
-Come on, let's go. Come on.
You didn't check closets.
Under the bed.
Go on.
Nothing happened here.
You should come to bed.
No... not her.
She probably spent the night
at her boyfriend's.
Would you please come to bed?
l'm on call in four hours.
l'm sure she's fine.
You're right.
l'm sure it's nothing.
Come on.
Are you coming?
Luis?
Luis?
Ned?
ls there a problem?
No, l'm fine.
l'm fine.
Excuse me, l'm Nell Barrows.
l'm Saffron's new neighbor.
And l was wondering, is she okay?
l thought l heard something.
Fucking?
No... a scream like.
She likes the hurt, too.
We went up to check on
her and she wasn't there.
What do you care
if she's in or not?
Unless you're
fucking her too.
Oh, no, l just thought
she might be hurt.
Hurt?
Excuse me, hurt?
Because she's making
lots of noise?
Oh, no, it's nothing. l just
thought l heard her scream.
Fucking bitch must've gone
to Ojai with Kevin.
lf you see Miss Dirty Legs again,
tell her that l am out of here.
Hey, great taste in shoes.
How far did you run?
-Five miles, l think.
-Me, too.
-Julia.
-l'm Nell.
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.
-Hey, come to the patio.
-Okay.
Are you kidding me?
l haven't missed a day
of running in 14 months.
l used to be enormous.
l can't even imagine that.
You look amazing.
Thanks.
So you've gotta show me
these trails.
-How about tomorrow morning at eight?
-That's great.
There's a great farmer's
market on Sunday mornings.
And a lot of good book
stores a few blocks over.
Really?
Gotta check them out.
Steven, is at the hospital
all the time. Even today.
That's no fun.
l know. He's a young doctor.
lt's part of the deal...
But with moving thrown into mix
and this awful building...
l know.
Did you like...
Providence?
My dad died
three weeks ago.
Oh, God...
l am so sorry.
No, l'm sorry. l open my
mouth and this came out.
-l didn't mean to ruin our talking.
-No. You didn't ruin anything.
Yes. Yes, l did.
ltjust popped out.
lt's huge. You lost
the first man you ever loved.
Yeah, that's it.
That's it exactly.
What do you say you and l go find
a place to get a piece of cake?
Let's go.
Chocolate.
Hello. This is Julia.
l have a problem
with my bedroom door.
-Austin.
-Hey, Mom.
-My door knob came off.
-l'll send Ned up.
You know what?
l think l can do it myself.
l'll call back if
l need to. Thanks.
-No problem.
-Over and out.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help! Help me!
You know you're not supposed to
do any repair work on Sunday.
l didn't do any. l didn't.
l received numerous noise
complaints here yesterday.
There was hammering.
Ned, l appreciate your
dedication to the job here...
butjust follow
the guidelines.
We wouldn't want
your enthusiasm...
to result in another
noise complaint.
Or bring the police again.
-Yes, sir.
-l'm glad we cleared that up.
l'm going to go
fix that door.
Luis, l was supposed to meet
Julia. Did she leave already?
No.
-Maybe l have the wrong time.
-l'm sorry. l haven't seen her.
Julia! lt's Nell!
-Thanks, Luis.
-Hey, Nell.
-Did l miss Julia?
-No, she didn't come down.
Her car's in the garage.
She should be here.
Smoking pot is one thing.
He was taping that girl
across the hall.
You sure it wasn't
a porn site?
He's spying
on our neighbor.
You know, the one who
used to look like a whale?
-Excuse me.
-Good day.
Julia? lt's Nell.
Please, open up the door.
Are you okay?
What?
May l please speak
with you for a moment?
What are you,
the new shrink?
No. My name is Nell.
l just moved in down the hall.
What do you want?
-l know you've been taping Julia.
-Jesus Christ, did my mom tell...
No, no, please. Please.
l just want to look at it.
No fuckin' way!
That's freaky!
Look, l think something
happened to her.
Can l please just see
the inside of her apartment?
Or the tape that
you made yesterday?
-Please.
-Sorry. No can do.
Parents made me
erase the hard drive.
Sorry.
Please come home now.
What happened?
Are you okay?
l just don't want to be alone.
l need you here.
Nell, listen. Are you okay?
ls this an emergency?
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
l'm sorry, l've got to go.
Can't l just please have 5 minutes
of your undivided attention?
Do you know the kind of
pressure l'm under?
l'll be right there, guys.
l swear l'll be right there.
And then l come home to...
You come home to what?
Hold on you guys.
l'll be right there.
l'm sorry, Nell. l'm sorry.
l'm frustrated. l'm freaking out.
lt's crazy over here.
l've got to go. All right?
Just be calm. Take it easy.
l'll be home as soon as l can.
You're okay?
-Honey, okay?
-l love you, too.
Good-bye. l love you.
Sit tight.
Damn it!
Oh, God!
l am so sorry.
l didn't even see you.
lt's okay. l've always been
a wallflower of sorts.
How are you Nell?
l don't know...
have you seen Julia today?
Julia Cunningham?
She lives...
The walls listen.
-The Lusman's an odd bird.
-What do you mean, Chas?
Buildings have personalities,
just like people.
l've lived here for decades and
haven't figured out this one.
lt took me a long time
to feel at home here.
Now l can't be
anywhere else.
Well, l'm glad
to hear that.
l can't believe how long
you've lived here.
What is it? 60 years?
l came out as a contract player
at Grand Street Pictures.
Look at me...
right there.
Handsome devil, wasn't l?
They paid me
50 dollars a week.
More than enough
to cover my fees here.
-This is a great picture of you.
-See ya, Nell.
Oh, your magazine.
All these changes,
these renovations.
They can't be good.
Opening the place up
like a...
patient anesthetized
on a table.
Not good.
Well, at least
we have a doorman.
lt's not about
what can get in.
lt's about
what's already here.
Don't worry...
you'll find your friend.
Okay... 504 should be...
this way.
506.
505.
504?
502.
506, 505, 50... 4?
Yes, what is it?
ls there an apartment
number 504?
Can you help us?
Jesus Christ.
No. 503, 505... no 504.
Don't you think
that's weird?
l don't understand your fascination
with a building you despise.
ls this about the deposit?
Look.
There's no 304 either.
All the keys
are on the wall.
Each floor is missing
the same apartment.
Look. No 404.
No 204, no 104.
You've got a sharp eye.
No one's noticed that before.
But why?
There is no 'why'.
There's no mystery here.
l mean, you know, skyscrapers
don't have a 13th floor.
This building
doesn't have certain rooms.
Chalk it up as another one of
the Lusman's charming oddities.
ls that all?
You live at the Lusman?
You're right there at the end.
Pale rider's galloping in.
You're lucky to see what it once was
before the quote unquote improvements.
There are some strange
things about that building.
You want to know
about the symbols, right?
-l can tell you some stories.
-What stories?
l thought they were
just decoration.
Hell no. Lusman had those
symbols there for a reason.
Bad juju.
That's what they're about.
You sure you want to
hear all this?
Lusman hung out
with these hipsters...
into all sorts of
black magic.
The Talman Lunar Cult.
Main guy was
some aerospace pioneer...
trying to fuse
science and magic.
Back in the day,
the Lusman was as scary...
as Cielo Drive was
after Manson.
-Do you know it's missing apartments?
-Lay that on me again?
Each floor is missing
the same apartment.
Wild. Check this out.
lt's one of the great
untold stories.
Lusman got all these stars
to invest in his place.
And then all of a sudden,
bam, shit goes down.
The scandal sheets start blasting
him for his occult connections.
Construction workers
are dying.
City goes in
and shuts him down.
Poor old Jack spends ten years
finishing the place by himself.
Didn't you say the symbols
meant something?
Each one's part of a spell.
So they say.
-They're all over the blueprints.
-Oh, let me see that.
This is awesome.
Wacky Jack done good.
Everything's connected.
-Where's the side view?
-Right here.
See, they're stacked on top of
each other like a deck of cards.
With stairs running through
from the basement on up.
There are whole rooms
in there!
Our minds don't work with
these sort of spatial anomalies.
Each room takes a little bit here and
there so nobody knows the difference.
Wacky Jack's
a fucking genius.
Wait. Wait. Slow down.
What are you saying?
l'm saying there's a whole
townhouse inside your building.
The only problem is,
there's no entrance.
lt's like Wonderland
without a little green pill.
lt's like Oz without
a yellow brick road.
Do you have anything else?
Yeah, they took a bunch of
photos at the groundbreaking.
Okay... first floor.
One, two, three.
-So you get the part?
-You know the saying.
You win some, you lose some.
And some get
washed away by an...
Old Testament style flood.
l hear you.
Good evening, Nell.
Shit.
Luis! l'm stuck
in the goddamned elevator.
Shit.
You've got to be
kidding me.
Luis! Get me the hell
out of here, man!
Third floor, baby.
You can do it.
What are you...?
Thank God for backups.
Holy shit!
Come on. Open up!
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
-l need to see your wife.
-What?
-Her friend's fuckin' dead!
-What are you talking about?
-Jesus Christ! She's dead!
-What are you talking about?
Nell? What are you? Nell!
Julia? Julia?
Oh, please,
let me get out of here.
Please, God! Please!
-Help!
-She was right...
She was right
the whole time.
The lines are dead.
-lt's just a quirk in the building.
-Byron, you've heard the rumors.
They're full of shit.
-She's in danger.
-She's delusional.
Julia's dead.
Go to her room. You'll see.
Just take it easy, man.
There's nothing going on here.
Then what's this?
Look. Look.
There's these cracks.
-Austin! Go get the police.
-Right.
Be careful.
Oh, my God, what is this?
-Nell!
-Oh, Jesus Christ!
Nell!
Oh, my God...
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Nell!
What the fuck!
We've got to get the police
and let them come in...
with their body armor
and the guns.
-She could be dead by then!
-So could we.
We can't wait
for the police.
We stay together.
l can't believe this is here
and no one knew about it.
What is this place?
lt's where people
come to die.
What the fuck
does that mean?
You've heard
the same stories l have.
What stories?
Things the residents say.
Noises they can't explain.
Like something
lives in the walls.
Probably rats.
Well, then you go back!
Luis and l...
Where's Luis?
-Where the fuck did he go?
-Luis?
No!
What is this?
-How do we get out of here?
-Stop talking.
-Are you crazy?
-Listen. There's somebody here.
Nell! Nell, it's me.
Oh, my God!
How'd you get here?
How do we get out of here?
There's a trap door
on the roof.
Don't kill me!
Oh, my God.
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go! Let's go!
Steven, it's a spell!
The building is a spell, Steven!
The symbols, the symbols
are part of the spell.
Nell, be quiet. Be quiet.
Nell! Be quiet.
Nell, l'm going to get you
out of here. Come on.
All this death...
lt taps into something.
lt taps into something.
Steven, it taps into something.
lt keeps him here.
lt keeps him alive.
lf they change the building,
they'll destroy him.
Back up. Back up.
No, no, Steven, it's okay!
No, Steven!
lt's okay, Steven!
lt's okay!
-Nell.
-Chas.
Please, he knew l told you
about the room.
l didn't think
he'd find out.
Why? Why did you tell me
about the room?
l knew you were the one
meant to find it.
Separation between
life and death...
is not the same for him.
He was a coffin birth.
Fighting his way out
of his mother's womb...
as she laid in her casket.
The mourners
heard his cries...
and pulled him out.
He was born of death.
l can get you out of here.
But we don't have much time.
Come on.
l'm so sorry.
Steven!
Run, run, run.
Tell me you can hear me.
Can you hear me? Tell me!
Steven!
No!
Please...
You're hurt, baby.
You're hurt.
lf he hurt you...
We need more officers
here now.
Puncture wound
to the abdomen.
They'll take good care of him, Ma'am.
Let them do their work.
l'll be okay. l'll see you
at the hospital.
