Tell me a story.
Aaron, Gerry Hadler.
It's been a while.
You need to be here.
For the funeral.
Luke's funeral.
We're expecting you.
..weather forecast.
Once again,
there is no rain in sight,
with continuing
drought conditions
and ongoing fire danger
across the state.
In related news...
..almost 70%
is now drought-declared.
Regional areas are receiving
drought assistance
from the State Government,
although with limited impact,
as farming communities
struggle with the worst...
..communities across the country
are bracing
for another dangerous
bushfire season this summer.
The Bushfire and Natural
Hazards Research Centre
says a hot winter and...
You're not one of them
TV journalists, are you?
No, I'm an old mate
of Luke's, actually.
Bloody tragic.
We gather this morning
in sadness
in this time of trouble
and devastating drought.
We come to honour the lives
of Karen and Billy...
..and Luke.
This is yet another hardship
through which our community
must bond together.
We do so with sadness,
but with a sense of promise.
As we pray together
in the name of the Father
and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit...
- Move!
- Come on, come on!
- Catch, Gretchen.
- Oh, thanks.
This is bloody beautiful.
Hurry up.
Jealous?
As if, Gretchen.
- Ellie's jealous!
- Oh!
You look like shit.
How are you, Gretchen?
I still can't believe it.
I was wondering
if you'd be here.
Yeah, well,
where else would I be?
Come on. Barb and Gerry
have booked the hall.
Everyone's been
making sandwiches.
Hey, Lachie! Gentle!
Yeah,
Luke said you had a kid.
Did he?
Poor little thing. He's in
the same class as Billy.
I don't know how you're meant
to explain to a kid how...
Did Luke say anything to you?
No.
You know, I was meant
to give him a call,
but, you know,
just never, you know...
You don't need to make excuses.
We all feel guilty.
I'll just put these over here.
We just wanted
to thank you all
for coming here today
to... to pay your respects
to Karen and to Billy.
What's happened
has been a terrible thing,
but we hope that eventually
you'll be able to remember Luke
the way he was before.
He was a friend to many of you
and he loved that family of his.
Yeah,
till he butchered 'em.
Oh, not today.
Hey, I came here to drink
for the kid and Karen, alright?
Not celebrate a murderer.
- Oh!
- Shut up, Grant.
Not now, not fuckin' never.
- Oi!
- Call that running?!
- Come on!
- Aaron!
Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo! Come on, Luke!
Whoo! Hey, Gretchen.
What took you so long?
Ellie.
Stay back, Mal.
Ellie?
This is Charlotte.
Oh, she's struggling
with the formula.
And she's so restless,
aren't you, darling?
There we are. Oh...
Gerry says I waste water
on the roses.
Oh, it's just a bucket
after a shower.
They're still hanging on.
- Hey, Gerry.
- Aaron.
Sit down.
How are you both coping?
Well, thank you for asking.
Most people who come here
can't even look us
in the eye, can they, Gerry?
Obviously, Luke didn't do it.
He wouldn't, and you know that.
He wouldn't do it to himself
and he certainly wouldn't do it
to that beautiful family.
And that's why we've...
..we've been wondering
if you would help us.
Barb's got a theory.
When we let Luke
have the farm,
obviously, we thought
we were helping him.
But over the last couple
of weeks, I've been thinking.
You know,
with the drought so bad
and everybody's desperate,
there's the wheat crop
failing and...
Now, if he had to borrow
from someone
and... and then
he couldn't pay them back,
now, they might have
come to the farm...
Barb, if you're worried about
how the investigation ran,
um, I could possibly
put you in touch
with some people I know
in Melbourne.
No, no.
We... we saw you on the news.
- The Pemberley case.
- Right.
And we were all following that,
and you got the money back.
And Luke was so proud
that you were his friend.
You'll look at the books
before you head home?
Well, legally, I'm not actually
allowed to interfere in an...
You look.
For Barb's sake.
You lied back then, Aaron.
Luke lied as well.
I've always known.
The day that...
that poor girl drowned, I...
..I saw Luke
coming back from the river,
nowhere near the field
you boys said you were in.
- We were shooting rabbits.
- Bullshit!
I loved my son.
But you tell me,
if he did this now...
..could he have done it then?
To Ellie?
Maybe if...
..if either of us had told the
truth back then, then maybe...
I'll take a look
at the books, OK?
But then I'm gone.
Ellie!
Luke...
Don't!
Luke! Let go of her!
What are you doing?
Luke, she can't breathe!
Let go!
- The fuck is wrong with you?!
- I'm sorry, Ellie!
We have a two-night minimum.
Right, I'm just staying
the one night, so...
Right.
Thank you.
Alright, I've got
full-strength or mid.
- Um...
- I'm out of mid.
Oh, you beauty!
I'm on a roll!
How are you goin'?
You haven't changed at all,
have you? Hmm?
'Cause I've been seeing
your face in my dreams for...
..fuck knows how long.
Isn't that right, Uncle Mal?
- Look who's here.
- Why are you back, Falk?
I thought you got the message.
You bring the kid with ya?
That son of yours,
that bloody son,
is he back here as well
with you?
Sit down.
He is the son. Just sit down.
It's alright.
You've gone and upset him now.
You see, he thinks you're your
prick of a father.
It's OK, Mr Deacon.
OK, is it? Just like that, Falk?
All OK? Hmm?
I never got a chance to say
back in the day, but I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm sorry about Ellie.
You fuck off right now.
What, do you want me to fuckin'
help you with that, do you?
Well, that's the thing, Grant,
about being a public bar.
Anyone can drink here
and now that includes
him and you.
Yeah, the problem's
not with him being in the bar.
It's a problem with him
being in Kiewarra at all.
Now, you understand this,
and you tell your boy.
There's nothing here
for you at all
other than
a whole load of people
who remember what your son...
..did to my daughter.
Oh, chill out, Gretch.
I was just muckin' around.
I wasn't gonna bloody drown her.
You could have killed her.
OK. Alright.
I'm fuckin' sorry!
Sorry, Ellie! Sorry!
Far out. Chill the fuck out.
Yeah, alright. Settle. Settle.
- Funny?
- Alright.
You think it's funny? Yeah?
- Yes.
- Funny? Really funny.
I'm sorry.
Idiot.
Ellie,
let's get away from this.
- Stop it!
- Come on!
It was pretty funny!
What's wrong with you?
Where is
the dirty fuckin' pig, eh?!
You're fucked! Where are ya?
Are you up there, copper?!
Wake up, copper!
Wake up, you stinkin' pig!
Oi!
What are you doin'
back in our town, boy?!
Oi! Wake up!
You're a fuckin' killer!
Fuckin' right!
You killed poor little...
Fuckin' liar! You're a killer
and a fuckin' liar!
Oh, g'day, it's Aaron.
Look, um, I'm gonna need
a little bit more time out here.
Uh, the funeral was pretty
devastating, to be honest.
So I'm gonna stay behind
and, um, help the family out
with a couple of things.
I'm not sure how long
it'll take, but at least a day.
So I will take this
as personal leave.
OK. Thank you.
G'day.
How are you goin'?
Can I help you?
I'm Aaron Falk.
I'm a friend of the Hadlers.
Oh, right. Greg Raco.
Local sergeant.
Gerry said you'd swing by.
AFP, right?
Must be something.
No, I'm just here
in a personal capacity.
Right.
Told 'em I'd have
a look at the books.
Yep. Their house now.
- I'll show you.
- Great.
Did you find 'em?
The bodies?
Yeah.
Karen was there.
It seems she met Luke
at the front door.
I don't know. Does your missus
meet you when you come home?
I'm not married, mate.
Yeah. It's been
bugging me a bit.
Where'd you find the boy?
Uh...
Just... in here.
Uh... I found Charlotte
in through here,
if you want to see.
- Just, uh...
- This one?
No, the other.
Screaming her little lungs out.
Dehydrated herself.
It's, uh, eight steps.
He would have still had the
adrenaline going, blood pumping.
Eight steps...
..to stop and change his mind
and not shoot the baby.
Maybe babies don't make
great witnesses.
What do you think?
Don't know.
You knew him, didn't you?
What do you think?
Was this the first time
you were a first responder?
Yeah.
Did you do the debrief sessions?
Yeah. Down in Ballarat.
I saw the head doc.
Not terribly helpful.
You've just got to keep going.
You've got to keep going back.
Yeah, no, I know.
Well, thanks for
showing me around, eh?
Yeah, no worries.
That was a nice service.
Oh, what we needed.
The tree hasn't got a hope,
of course.
God knows what we're supposed
to tell the kids when it dies.
There it is.
Where she worked.
She did the accounts?
Yeah. Mainly.
Just two days a week.
Any problems
that you were aware of?
Well, I mean,
it's not, you know...
It's nothing I didn't already
tell the other detectives.
She made a couple of errors
in the accounts.
Nothing serious.
But we did speak and she was...
..she was upset
about her husband.
Did she tell you
why she was upset?
Pretty vague. You know, money.
But everyone here's
worried about money.
Uh...
Did she seem at all scared
of him to you? Luke?
I mean... I didn't think so.
I suppose I wasn't
listening hard enough.
Clearly, I missed the signs.
Yeah, well...
Thanks.
Any time.
Listen, um... I don't know.
If you... if you want to do
a careers talk sometime,
the kids would love it.
We could all use
some inspiration.
- Thanks for your time.
- Yeah, no worries.
Cheers.
Gretchen.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Thought you were a ghost before.
You couldn't wait
to get out of here.
Nah, I just wanted to see
where Karen worked.
Well, here it is. High glamour.
So what was she like?
Younger.
Nah, she was
a good person, actually.
Yeah, the Hadlers
have asked me to hang around.
Yeah, course they have.
Barb's never gonna be able
to accept that she,
queen of the CWA with
the award-winning lamingtons,
raised a...
Hey, remember us in here?
Grade three? Miss Massey?
Yeah.
She took away my recorder.
Do you remember grade one,
you pissed on my exercise book?
- I did not!
- You did so!
They wouldn't let you
go to the toilet,
you couldn't hold it in,
and then Luke got up
and joined in too.
Ohh!
Solidarity.
Hey, if you're hanging around,
you're gonna need to eat.
Tonight?
You got another date?
It's just up here.
Hi there, rock tree.
Tell me your secrets.
It's beautiful.
I come up here
to get away from everything.
Can you help me with this?
- Shit!
- Oh, fuck.
Aaron!
Would have been lost
in here forever.
Here. Here.
It's just that it was my mum's.
Do you miss her?
Do you miss yours?
Whoa.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- Stop saying that.
Ellie?
Yeah, we're good.
- Hi.
- G'day.
Oh... Did you find something?
No, not yet.
But I was wondering...
Tell me, what is it
you were looking for
in the shed this morning
when I pulled up?
Ah.
It's just, um...
..the bullets don't match.
Three shots were those.
Remingtons.
They're blue.
But the only ammunition
I could find on the whole
property is Winchester.
Those shells are bright red.
So I'm still looking, but...
Luke and I used
to come fishing out here.
- Right.
- Look at it now.
Detectives say Luke
drove to his house at 4:30,
killed his family...
..then headed here
to kill himself.
Wouldn't be my choice
for a final resting place.
There's three properties
side by side around this lake.
Luke's family's,
Mal Deacon and Grant Dow's.
Who's running the Murray
property these days?
Uh...
That's, uh, Jamie Sullivan.
Lives with his nan.
Yeah, Jamie Sullivan was with
Luke the afternoon he died.
Shooting rabbits.
Had him come in to the station
a couple of times... What?
He said he was shooting rabbits?
Yeah. Why?
Who's this, then?
- G'day.
- Hello.
Just calm down, Gran.
They're cops.
But they're not staying.
I've just made
some chocolate cake.
Would... would you like some?
Oh, no. My wife's got me
on a low-sugar diet.
- We'd love some. Thank you.
- Oh.
Any chance we could
get a look at your gun, mate?
Yeah, no problem.
Are you boys here
about Luke Hadler?
Uh, just tying up
some loose ends, yeah.
Oh.
Poor Barb and Gerry.
Send them my love, will you?
I wanted to go
to the funeral, but...
..Jamie doesn't like me driving.
Thanks, mate.
What do you use this for?
Rabbits. Roos.
I keep asking him to shoot me,
but he's a sensitive soul,
my grandson.
Been having a bit of trouble
with the rabbits
getting into the canola,
so I asked Luke to come around
and give me a hand.
You supplied the ammo?
What sort?
Dunno. Um, Winchester,
Remingtons. Whatever's cheap.
Why?
Did Luke bring any of his own?
My bunnies, my bullets.
That's my way of thinking.
How'd he seem to you that day?
Fine. Same.
How long was he here for?
Uh, maybe about two beers.
Left about 4:15.
And did you go out after that?
No, no, just, um...
..stayed here and had
a cup of tea with Gran.
Did he say anything
about his family?
"Bloody women."
"Bloody women"?
What did he mean?
I asked him how Karen was
and he said,
"Bloody women, always
goin' on about somethin'."
And then he shot another rabbit
and then he went home
and he shot her and the kid.
- See you.
- Thanks, love.
..the United Nations
Climate Emergency Summit,
where we'll see world leaders
from across the globe...
- Hey, mate.
- G'day.
- G'day.
- G'day.
I saw you at the funeral.
You're sticking around?
Uh... yeah.
I was just closing up.
Do you want something?
No, I'm OK. I just, um...
My dad used to work here
when I was a kid,
so I was just... reminiscing,
you know?
- Falk?
- Yeah. Aaron.
- Yeah, Dr Leigh. Chris Leigh.
- Right.
So you knew the Hadlers?
Yeah, you know everyone
in this job.
Yeah, sometimes
too well, I bet.
Hey, I was wondering,
with, um... with Luke,
any obvious signs of distress?
With Karen?
Like, bruising or anything?
You know I can't tell you that.
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.
Still here?
You're OK if I stay another
night, aren't you, mate?
I know occupancy's
probably a huge...
Nah, mate, we're overrun.
Inundated. Swamped.
Thank you.
Night.
- G'day.
- Hi.
How are you?
Good.
That's nice.
Yeah, well, I thought
I should buy local.
It suits you.
I can see it really working
in one of your alleyway bars,
sipping espresso martinis.
I think you've got
the wrong idea about my life.
- Do I?
- Mm-hm.
Well, good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Cheers.
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.
So it won't shock you to learn
that it's all over town
that you're reopening
the investigation.
Most are sure
that you, of all people,
should be minding
your own business.
Tell me, you...
you're convinced he did it?
No shadow of a doubt?
Common things
occur commonly, right?
I mean, I didn't go to
detective school, but...
- G'day.
- What can I get you?
Oh, can we share the, uh,
fisherman's basket?
Yep. Good choice.
Ohh. We're a long way
from the ocean.
Oh, shut up. You'll love it.
- Go extra on the yabbies, eh?
- Yeah, that's too easy, mate.
Thanks, Kelly.
Was he ever violent with you?
Luke? No!
I mean, he was an arsehole
regularly, but...
Mmm. You guys gave it a crack?
On and off?
Yeah, I mean...
I guess it was a bit raw
after Ellie and...
..when you left and...
We just clung to each other.
We were just four dumb kids.
What do you think
happened to Ellie?
Oh, Aaron. Please, can we just
sit and drink our body weight?
It's just you never said
back then.
You never told me
what you thought.
Well, I think
she killed herself,
like I think Luke...
..snapped.
I think...
God, I think she was a kid
who needed support.
I mean...
..the stuff that was
going on at home.
Like what?
Like how she hated her dad.
You know, after her mum left,
people should have... stepped up.
But everyone looked away.
I mean, everyone still looks
away. We're very good at it.
So, yeah, I'm sure
they felt guilty about that.
But people don't like
feeling guilty, so...
..they find a letter
with your name on it
and, great, job done.
They can blame you
for the rest of their lives
'cause it's easier.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hello!
What's going on here?
You going up for a...
a quickie, are you?
You know, you want
to be careful, Gretch.
Birds that hang around with
this fella tend to end up dead.
Aww. Thanks, Grant.
Glad you have my back.
I've got your back,
your front...
I gotta say, you are looking
real, real fancy tonight.
That dress is beautiful.
Is that for him?
Jeez, I hope
you appreciate it, Falk.
Can I help you
with something, mate?
Now that you asked, you can.
Why don't you fuck off
back to where you come from?
What happened here
has got nothing to do with you.
Nothing.
See ya, Gretch.
Have a good one.
Come on, Grant.
Fires around Karoonda.
We've been waiting
so long for rain.
I should go.
If you say so.
I'm gonna jump one day.
Just... jump.
When I'm old as fuck, why not?
Hello?
Hello?
Barb?
Gerry?
Barb?
Oh, hello, love.
No secret is safe from
a good clean-out, is it?
Billy was obviously as bad at
spelling as his father!
Oh, Aaron.
I mean, what am I supposed
to do with all their things?
Can't you just... leave all this
stuff for a little while maybe?
No. Gerry says it's...
it's time we faced it now.
Oh!
Oh, my God.
These are library books!
How overdue are
these bloody things?!
I'll take them back.
I can return these.
Don't worry. It's OK.
Have you thought about what
you're gonna do with the farm?
Why? Have you found something?
Was the farm the motive?
No, probably not.
What about the finances?
There's nothing amiss.
But you're still here.
Did you look
at those books?
Yes.
Yeah, there was nothing.
I'm sorry.
Thought with Luke, we might
have had a bit longer, but...
Oh, it's all gonna
be big machines
from now on anyway.
Remote-controlled.
GPS.
Farms with no people.
Imagine that.
No need for towns.
No need for any of us.
Gonna give me
a hand with that?
Yeah, sure.
That was really beautiful.
My mum used to sing it to me,
over and over and over.
Bit sentimental to me.
- I'm gonna go for a piss.
- Cheers.
Oh, fuck!
Luke?
Luke! Luke!
- Luke?
- Luke?! Luke?!
- He's faking it!
- Gretch, just calm down.
You guys
took your time, didn't you?
You're an arsehole.
Fucking dickhead!
Fuck you, Luke!
Really?
What?
You guys make me sick.
The way you two indulge him
is nauseating.
Jesus, Ellie,
what's crawled up your arse?
- Why don't we just go back...
- No, I'm asking as a friend.
- And even Gretch is saying.
- Luke...
You don't drink. You don't even
fuckin' laugh anymore.
Luke!
Fine. I'll go.
Fuck... Ellie!
Ellie, I'm sorry. Come back.
Ellie! Ellie...
Hey, Jamie!
Come on, Jamie.
So, you never met
Karen Hadler?
No.
Then why did she have
a news article about you?
No idea.
That's it.
Now bring it up higher.
A bit higher!
Yeah, that'll do, mate.
Leave it there.
Look who's here. It's the pigs.
Looking for a job,
are you, boys? Eh?
You're out of luck here, right?
There's a no-dickhead
policy, see?
Grant, how would you describe
your relationship
with Karen Hadler?
Masturbatory.
You found her attractive?
Yeah, she's alright, I guess,
for 'round here. Yeah.
When was the last time
you spoke to her?
I honestly couldn't tell you.
I don't fucking know.
What about a week
before she died?
On February 19?
Do I have to stay for this? Huh?
How is this prick allowed
to question me? What...
And you're just gonna sit there?
Perhaps you could tell us...
..why your name, Grant,
was written by Karen Hadler
the week she died.
You're not pinning
this fucking thing on me.
Pinning what on you, Grant?
Listen, if Luke Hadler wants to
go 'round shooting his family,
that's his fuckin' business.
Right? This has got nothing
to do with me. Nothing.
Where were you
that afternoon, Grant?
It's in the police report.
Read the fuckin' police report.
Mmm. I've read it.
It says you were working
out on Eastway,
with a couple of the mates
that you've listed there.
Do you stand by that?
Yeah, we were there all day.
We were at the pub after.
Go and ask 'em.
You asked 'em. Go and ask 'em.
You work hard, don't you,
on your uncle's farm.
Planning on selling it
after he dies?
That's none of your
fuckin' business.
And what about
Luke's farm?
I hear it'll come up for sale
eventually.
You're trying to buy
Jamie Sullivan, aren't you?
Three properties side by side.
Yeah, that sounds
a lot more attractive
to potential investors, Grant.
- What do you reckon?
- Well...
Fuck you and fuck you,
Falk, alright?
Grant...
Don't say my name like
you know me!
You don't fucking know me!
You didn't ever fucking know
me, Falk! You don't know me!
Stop saying my name like that.
We're gonna check your
movements on that day.
We're gonna check
everything you've said.
And maybe you've got
a couple of mates
that'll back you up, you know?
But alibis...
..you put them under
enough pressure
and they just crumble real fast.
Like yours. Yeah?
What was the alibi
you and Luke come up with
all the way back then, was it?
Shoot... shooting rabbits?
The CCTV cameras,
I want to look at them.
Dow's lying.
I want to test that alibi.
Yeah, we took 'em all.
Jamie Sullivan too.
He wasn't with his nan.
- He's lying.
- Yeah.
Yeah, there's one
beside the pub,
uh, one over
the pharmacy storeroom,
two covering the service station
and two over the school.
Start there.
Start with the school.
Mm-hm.
School. End of the day.
There's Karen Hadler.
It's just two hours
before she was...
Does she look like
she's struggling?
I don't know.
And then
nothing for a while.
One hour. Two hours.
Ah, there's Principal Whitlam.
He knows by now. We called him.
That's it.
Thanks, mate.
That's Luke's car.
We found it out at the dry lake.
Ellie! Can we just talk about
what happened last night?
There's nothing to talk about.
There is.
I just want to help you.
- I don't need your help.
- Fucking bullshit.
Hey, do... do you want
to help me get this home?
I can't.
No worries.
Bye.
Ellie!
- You alright?
- Yeah.
Oh, Christ.
Uh, righto, guys, just
give us a little room, please.
Did anyone see anything?
Nah, nothing.
No-one? Right.
Uh, Jim?
Can you give me a hand...
Yeah, some prick
put a calf...
Basically all over town.
Pretty much every
building and fence.
- Here he comes now.
- Oh, this'll be good.
Alright, guys, just hang out.
Mate, we'll get them
taken down, alright?
Where is he? Is he in here?
I don't want you in there.
- Let me talk to him.
- Mate, mate, mate, listen.
Come and have a drink
at my place, alright?
We'll clean your car up.
OK?
Hey, Wal, John,
get these down, will you?
- Get 'em down.
- No worries.
Ellie?
Ellie?
Mate, nice place.
Oh, yeah.
Suburbia in the country.
Worst of both worlds.
- You good?
- That's it. Yep.
Here you go.
Oh, mate, thanks.
- Cheers.
- You too, mate. Thanks.
Hey, thanks for your help
with all that too.
No worries. Happy to help.
Don't know what
I would have done out here
if you hadn't have been saving
your dirty water.
I, uh, thought you might like
to hear her voice.
Hi, Sandra. It's Karen.
I'm so sorry to do this to you,
but I'm afraid Billy can't
come over this afternoon.
He's a bit under the weather.
I think it's better
if he just comes straight home.
Is that OK?
Sorry for the late notice,
Sandra.
OK, bye.
Just so you know
she was a real person.
Did you call her back?
Honestly... I was annoyed.
We had a plan and, uh...
Love, love.
How could you have known
it was gonna turn out like that?
Alright? None of us knew.
I'm sorry. Um...
She was nice.
Welcoming, which...
Can be a bit unusual
around here, right?
Everyone loved her, you know?
And what that animal did
to Karen and her little boy...
Yeah.
Aaron was, uh,
friends with Luke Hadler
when they were kids, so...
Well, maybe he was
different back then.
Can you...
Can you imagine
what Karen and Billy's
last moments
must have been like?
Can you?
Yeah, um...
I'm sorry.
Can I show you something?
Sure.
I found this.
Oh, wow.
School archives.
You and your old man.
Oh, that's amazing.
Huh.
Um, listen, I...
I'm sorry about Sandy.
She's the reason I took the job.
We got robbed...
..back in Melbourne and, um...
..the girls were out,
thank God, but...
..I was held at knifepoint.
- Jesus!
- Yeah.
It was a couple of junkies.
Cleaned out the safe, you know?
All of Sandy's jewellery.
What did the cops say?
They find 'em or...
Never got 'em.
Just never got 'em.
And, um... um...
..she's been rattled ever since.
- Of course.
- Yeah.
I think the invasion of it.
I don't know.
It just feels like, uh...
It feels like she's drifting
away from me, you know?
Anyway...
- Another beer?
- Yeah, sure.
Hey, mate.
Have you seen Aaron?
No?
Do you have any idea
where he went after school?
No. He usually comes
straight home.
Hey, Dad.
Mate, where have you been?
They're saying they found
a body in the river.
A teenager.
I thought it was you.
Aaron. Aaron!
Keep everyone up on the bank!
Stay back, Mal.
My girl!
- Ellie?
- My girl!
I slaved over this!
Oh, what I wouldn't give!
I keep saying she can have one.
- Just one. I know.
- How much longer?
Four weeks, fingers crossed.
Yeah, the baby's lying
the wrong way, but she'll turn.
She might not. She could
be stubborn like her dad.
Oh, right.
Can you go and put the dessert
in the oven, please?
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.
No sugar for me, thanks, mate.
Have you been bitching
and moaning about the diet?
- No...
- I hope not!
He's been having
a packet of Tim Tams
every night of this pregnancy.
He's the one that's gonna get
gestational diabetes.
You've been helpful.
I think he's developed
a bit of a man crush.
Yeah, look, he's doing
really well, you know?
He's very dedicated,
very thorough.
He's also very trusting.
It's odd for the job,
but it's what he's wanted to do
since he was a kid
and so I've supported him.
Yeah, well, you moved
all the way out here.
I did.
I think it would be
hideous for someone
to take advantage of him
for their own benefit.
So you've heard
some stories about me?
- I've heard some.
- Mmm.
Honestly,
like your husband,
I just want to know
whether or not
Luke Hadler killed his family.
Oh, no!
Is she grilling you?
She does that.
- Nah, nah, nah.
- Yes!
Because I don't want you
and some stranger - no offence -
to go chasing after,
what is it, a serial killer?
Well, that is actually my job,
is to hunt down...
He hasn't slept
since he found them.
Hey!
Not OK.
Look, there's nothing
to worry about, honestly.
- Promise?
- I give you my word.
Good.
Aaron, mate, there's trouble.
That note you gave Ellie,
they found it on her.
They think it's you.
You asked her
to meet you at the river?
Yeah, but she never showed up.
Mate, there's no fuckin' way
they're gonna believe you.
- Jesus...
- Aaron, mate?
Aaron, mate, are you listening?
I'll help you.
If anyone asks, you waited
for her, she didn't show up,
so you and me, we went
shooting rabbits together
out in the back paddocks
near the Cooran Road.
We hit... we hit one or two.
Alright?
No, two. Two.
Say two. Alright?
Yeah, OK. Two.
Alright.
Don't forget, we were together.
Go on, say it.
I was with Luke Hadler...
Yeah.
- ..shooting rabbits...
- Mm-hm.
..out on the Cooran Road
paddocks.
Right.
Are you sure
you don't know where he was
after school hours?
No idea.
I was shooting rabbits.
Whereabouts?
The Cooran Road paddocks.
Just on your own or...
No, I was with Luke Hadler.
Just you and Luke, yeah?
Yes. Just me and Luke.
Get off the road,
you idiot!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Come here!
Oof!
Get off him!
Calm down! Sit down!
Get your grandmother
to say that...
Shut up.
- ..you fuckin' big mouth!
- Keep your mouth shut, OK?
- Fuckin' big mouth!
It's in your interest to keep
your mouth shut, Grant.
Just stay there.
Jesus.
Hey, you right?
Wrong place, wrong time.
What the hell happened here?
Our friend Dow
seems to think
the only reason he's
in the frame for the Hadlers
is 'cause Jamie Sullivan's
been spreading word
that he wants to buy
the property.
If we're bothering you, Grant,
all you have to do
is explain to me
why Karen Hadler wrote
your name on a piece of paper
a week before she was murdered.
How the fuck should I know?
Give me your keys.
- House is five kays away.
- Be good for your cardio.
Fuckwit.
You, come with me.
Why don't you all go home?!
- Righto!
- Piss off, ya dickhead!
Alright, enough! Oi!
Jesus Christ.
- Fun night?
- Yep.
All good.
Doc, can I talk to you
out here for a second?
You stay right there.
We have Jamie on camera
driving past here
the day the Hadlers
were murdered.
He lied to us.
He told us he was at home.
So this is your one chance
to tell us the truth.
Look, I wanted to say
something straightaway.
See, Jamie's a bloody idiot.
I told him he had...
I guess he panicked.
He was here?
The day the Hadlers
were murdered,
I had open surgery till 4pm.
He sent me a message,
I told him to come over...
The usual arrangement.
He arrived, we chatted,
had a cold drink...
..and went to bed.
Mate.
Interfering in an investigation?
Lying to an officer?
Like I care who
you sleep with, mate.
We needed the truth and
you wasted our fucking time.
You...
You think you're gonna get
the truth in a town like this?
I'm sorry?
When you've been lying about
something for... for so long...
..it becomes second nature.
Falk, you killer!
Stay there!
Dad.
Look, let me just stay
for the funeral.
You're leaving?
We have to bury her.
I'll come back.
You promise?
Tell Luke goodbye.
Hey, don't you touch,
you mongrel!
I come here every week
to keep that clean.
You keep your hands off her.
It's alright, mate.
I was leaving anyway.
Hey. Hey!
You're...
You're the kid, aren't you?
The Falk kid. Not the dad.
Yeah, I'm the kid.
You know he begged me, your dad?
He wanted me to tell
everybody in the town
to back off until
the police had finished.
As if I'd give him
the steam off my piss!
Must be a dreadful thing,
to have your old man
think so little of ya.
He might have been a coward,
your dad, but he wasn't stupid.
He wouldn't have
fallen for that story
you and the Hadler kid
cooked up!
Why is it you've always
been convinced
that Luke and I
weren't together?
Hey? What do you know, Mal?
I know I loved my daughter.
Dad...
Stay in the car.
Why have you stopped?
- Should have kept going!
- You won.
- We're going!
- Good! Good!
There's no need for you to stop.
You just keep on the bloody
road until you disappear.
- Everything you've done to us...
- Yeah?
My boy had nothing
to do with it!
- You don't know that.
- They were friends!
- I don't bloody care.
- This was our home!
- Don't you dare come back!
- Fuck you!
I'll fuckin' lay into ya!
I'm going to ask one time...
and never again.
So you tell me the truth.
Did you have anything
to do with that girl's death?
No.
No, Dad. Jesus!
I can't believe
you're even asking me that.
Were you really with Luke?
Look at me.
Were you really with Luke?
Yes.
- Heya.
- G'day.
What are you doing out here?
Oh, just felt like seeing
a friendly face.
Very nice bit of land
you got out here.
Very impressive.
Mmm. Thanks.
You should see it
after it rains.
Just gonna have to get
a few more of these
before I call it a day,
if that's OK.
Do you need anything
for your ears?
Nah, I'm right.
OK.
The warren's over there.
Point when you see one.
There's one.
You want a go?
Yeah, sure.
Do you need a lesson,
federal policeman?
Nah, I think I'm alright.
What's wrong? It's right there.
Fair enough.
You know I'm gonna have to
shoot it anyway, don't you?
Can't have 'em on my land.
Lachie?
Yeah, Mum! Nearly ready.
- Try and ignore the mess.
- Oh, you should see my place.
What's all this?
They're applications
to get funding for the school.
It's a nightmare.
- Is that Karen's handwriting?
- Yeah.
I try to do my best,
but it's not really my thing.
It's this Crossley Trust grant.
See if we can get further
than last year's shortlist.
- You've taken it on?
- Yeah.
The application's
doing my head in.
Hey, strange question...
..but did Karen ever mention me?
No. No, I don't think so. Why?
Oh, I'm just wondering if my
name ever came up. That's all.
Is that why you came to see me?
To ask me about Karen?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come back! Come back!
Hug!
Alright?
I want you to meet someone.
This is my oldest friend
in the world. This is Aaron.
- G'day.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Good.
Good stuff.
Alright. You be good, please.
I will!
- Love you!
- See ya!
Thanks, Andrea.
Sleepover.
Perfect timing, for once.
So will you
stay on till it's solved?
Why are you still here?
OK, then.
Professional habit.
Nah, you were always quiet.
But then you always
saw everything.
Oh, my God.
I've just remembered something.
Come. Come and have
a look at this.
- Oh, no!
- Yes!
Oh, here we go.
Mmm.
What have we got in here?
- Oh, wow.
- Mmm.
Gymnastics award. Look out!
Oh. Look at Ellie.
- Leave it.
- Oh, no, I can't.
I can't. It might be Lachie.
Oh, it is. Hang on.
Sorry. I'll be back.
Hey, Andrea.
Is everything alright?
Alright.
Do you want to put him on?
Yeah.
Hey, mate! Are you alright?
Oh, OK.
Poor thing.
Alright. Well, why don't you
see how you feel after tea?
OK.
Alright. Love you.
Thanks, Andrea. Thank you.
Yeah, no worries. Alright.
Thanks for calling. Bye.
Aw! He's feeling a bit homesick.
Do Gerry and Barb know?
Know... what?
There's nothing to know.
Did Karen?
What? No...
I told you,
Lachie's dad's not around.
Luke is an old friend.
He came to visit and hang out
with Lachie now and then.
Luke is not Lachie's father.
OK.
What's the birth
certificate say?
What?
It's blank.
Not that that's
any of your business.
What?
Have you got a...
photo of Lachie's dad?
Is there one... one photo
you could show me?
God, it was a two-night stand.
We didn't get a fucking selfie.
Why would I lie?
'Cause Luke asked you to.
What are you even asking me?
I have to ask.
Well, then ask.
Ask!
Three people were killed.
So I hope, for Lachie's sake,
that you lying about
your relationship with Luke
is the worst thing
you've done to that family.
Uh...
Get out.
Get out of my house.
- Hey...
- No, get the fuck out.
Sandra.
Are you OK?
Oh.
Just, uh, looking for Scott.
He said he might
pop in for a drink.
It's pretty late.
He's probably on his way home.
Yeah, he probably is.
I... I think it's all getting
a bit much for him.
Sandra?
Are you alright?
Is everything OK?
Sometimes I, uh... I think I see
people outside the house.
Watching us.
My imagination.
Um, I... I get nervous.
Why are they watching you?
Well, in Melbourne,
there, um... there was a...
There you are, love.
You almost gave me
a heart attack.
You OK?
I just thought
you were here. That's all.
OK. Well, I've been looking
everywhere for you.
Come on. Let's go home.
- Night.
- Thanks, mate.
Is Whitlam here
every night, mate?
Yeah.
It's hard to figure out
whether I should kick him out
early for his own good
or give him free drinks so
he dumps more into the pokies.
I assume you're staying
another night?
Yes, I am.
Ah.
The black hole of Kiewarra.
Jesus, mate!
Mal Deacon's been
down at the station.
Claims you assaulted him.
Does he?
Old man grieving
by his daughter's grave.
- He's lying. I'll sort it.
- No, you won't.
Word's out up the tree
there's an off-duty detective
looking into a case,
that's meant to be solved,
by the way!
Hey, calm down.
A detective who also has
personal history
with the death of Ellie Deacon.
I never lied about that fact.
I haven't wanted to ask.
So? What is this?
Is this a revenge trip?
'Cause, mate, you're obsessed
with Mal Deacon, Grant Dow.
There's more going on
in this town
than a girl who died in a river
20 years ago.
There's a connection
between the two deaths.
Well, I need a suspect.
I'm working on it.
I can't do my job
if the locals don't trust me.
I just need
a little bit more time.
No. We're nowhere.
Allowing you
a backstage pass was...
..stupid rookie shit.
You gotta go home now, alright?
I can handle this on my own.
ARRGGGGHH!
Hi, Rita. Is he here?
Did you find my...?
What are you doing here?
Karen's note.
Mate, it's not a name.
It's a grant. As in, funding.
- Let's go.
- Yeah.
Karen was concerned
about a grant for the school.
She wasn't scared of Grant Dow.
Or her husband.
She found something,
she told Luke,
Luke showed her this article,
and she was gonna call me
and ask for help.
Yeah, but what did she find?
I'm pretty sure Scott Whitlam's
got a gambling problem, pokies.
She made a query on this one
and only this one.
I think she probably
confronted him about it.
But the CCTV footage...
He was there at the school
while the murders took place.
When was the last time
you saw him drive his car?
He's always riding
his bloody bike!
Our records are very clear.
We approved the grant
and transferred $70,000
into an account two months ago.
Jesus.
You're absolutely sure
that it was transferred?
We're absolutely sure.
What are we doing about
getting this money back?!
Thanks, Helen. Leave it with us.
We're on it at this end.
70 grand and three dead.
Jesus!
Oh, you're here.
That was Helen,
from the Crossley
Educational Trust.
Could you give her a call back?
She said it's urgent.
Left my laptop at home.
No worries.
Alright. Well done.
- Scott. Where is he?
- He had to pop out for a bit.
Is his daughter still in class?
- Where is she?
- There, in the third row.
Would he leave town
without his child?
Go, go, go, go!
Clear.
Shit. Remingtons.
Forest.
I wouldn't.
Hey, Scott.
What are you... what are you
doing out here, mate?
You OK?
Best you stay back.
You do realise that
if that hits the ground,
this whole forest
will catch fire?
Hey! Put your fucking gun away!
- Cop!
- Do it.
Whatever you've done...
..you don't want to do this.
This whole place
is dry as a tinder.
It's just waiting to burn.
I'll drop it, mate. I will.
The school is close by.
You've got kids in there,
including your daughter, OK?
They'll all burn to death.
Look, I know
you love your family, hey?
I've seen you with them.
This whole thing
was for my family.
I brought them up here
to protect them!
They found me anyway,
came for the money I owed.
They made me hold the nail gun
they were gonna pin my daughter
to the wall with!
The carving knife...
..they were gonna slit
her throat with.
I had no choice!
You needed the money,
huh? For your family.
Everyone will understand.
Tell my wife
I never meant to hurt the boy.
Go!
They say you saved the town.
Stopped the school from burning.
And you put him out
with your bare hands.
He'll be OK.
I know he will.
What about Scott Whitlam?
Unrecognisable.
They've transferred him
to Melbourne.
He'll live.
Aaron!
We've been waiting
for you to wake up.
We're not the only ones.
I think word's
got out in the town.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.
Your old man would be
so bloody proud of you.
He always knew the man you were.
Cheers, mate.
Will you go on
the old TripAdvisor
and leave me a good review?
Five stars
all the way, mate.
Good man.
- Hey.
- G'day.
I, uh...
..wanted to come
to the hospital, but I was...
..too angry.
Well, I probably shouldn't have
accused you of murder.
- Oh...
- Bit of a mood-kill.
I don't know. I wanted to...
kill him a bunch of times.
You know, he loved Karen.
I was never his first choice,
which was...
Which was his loss.
Hey, there's something I need
to tell you before you go,
that I've wanted to tell you
for years, right?
'Cause I saw her.
Heading to the river.
And if I'd gone to her,
I could have stopped it, but...
..I didn't.
I left, with Luke.
He was with me that day.
So I lied too.
See you in another
20 years, hey?
Goodbye, El.
Ellie?
Ellie?
Ellie?
He called me by my
mother's name the first time.
"I'm Ellie," I try to scream.
"My name is Ellie."
He takes it anyway,
my name from me.
Oh, bloody hell!
Grant! Come!
A punch.
Hard.
I can't feel it.
Can't taste the blood.
Can't move. Can't cry.
Frozen in 40 degrees.
My mother hated him too.
She ran away,
said she'd be back for me.
Hope disguised as a lie.
It's my turn now... to leave.
"I'll kill her if I find her,"
he said.
Oh, El.
"I'll kill you too
if you try and run away."
Just try,
because I'll be gone,
long gone.
Another name.
Another home, far from here.
Goodbye, Ellie Deacon.
Time for a new life.
Stay there, Grant!
No! Dad!
Stop!
