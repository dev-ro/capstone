TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA
(MEKAGOJIRA NO GYAKUSHU)
Sir, we will arrive at the
ocean boundary shortly.
Prepare to submerge the submarine
before we reach the ocean boundary.
Roger. Begin submersion, depth 250!
Beginning submersion, depth 250.
The scattered remains of Mechagodzilla
should be found within this area.
It would be in our best interest to collect
the head. Be as careful as possible.
I understand.
Depth, 250!
Switch to deep sea scanning!
Searchlight!
Begin procedures!
That's strange... Our analysis
equipment is having no reaction.
There are no traces of space-titanium
within a 500 meter radius.
Even if there wasn't any wreckage, we should
have received some kind of reaction by now.
It's not within the radius of this area?
We show absolutely nothing.
Mechagodzilla's remains must be...
What is it?
- Blow the main tanks!
It's no use!
Base! Base! We're in trouble!
Certainly, the ocean exploration research
ship was in its experimental stages.
But I cannot believe the accident was caused by
a design flaw or some kind of technical error.
What has become of the wreckage?
Well, it appears that a powerful form of
energy ripped the submarine to pieces.
Ripped it apart?
It wasn't an explosion?
I'm sure of it.
He's right, Boss.
Take a look at this.
A flying saucer?
That's what we've concluded.
The cinema crew that took this photo
swore it was taken on the day it sank.
We cannot say what it is yet, but we
need to be very cautious now.
I'm Ichinose from the Ocean
Exploration Research Institute.
Hey, Ichinose!
- Hey, old buddy!
You two know each other?
Yes, we went college together.
Really? Well, well... have a seat.
- Right.
We were waiting for you.
Thanks...
Now that we are all here...
...I want you to listen to the data
from this voice recorder.
Answer us! Answer us, please!
Base! Base! Answer us!
Ah! A fish! It's coming for us!
No, it's not a fish!
It's a dinosaur!
A dinosaur?
Replay that again.
No, it's not a fish!
It's a dinosaur!
A dinosaur!
He definitely said "dinosaur"...
You're from the marine institute,
what do you think?
I don't believe it...
Commander, sorry to keep you waiting.
How was your trip?
Earth vehicles are so horrible.
Thousands of hours of space flight could not
compare to one hour in their inferior vehicles.
Incredible...
But they will soon tremble
before our might.
So, this is Tokyo...
This city is the very essence of
what is wrong with the Earth.
Ignoring the pollution and destruction they've
created and not knowing what to do about it...
I do not understand them...
This is what will become of Tokyo...
Our city will be built once we've
destroyed the old one...
And the preparations?
- They're going forward as planned.
The base on our third planet is
being pulled in by the black hole.
We must relocate to the Earth.
We cannot allow failure...
Commander, it might be useful
to hire some earthlings.
Earthlings?!
A science instructor, Dr. Shinzo Mafune.
He is an extraordinary earthling
that may benefit our cause.
Can you trust him?
As long as we keep
his daughter alive.
Besides, Dr. Mafune hates
his fellow earthlings!
And why is that?
Twenty years ago, Dr. Mafune was
the top scientist in his field.
His research was more advanced than
the others and he was punished for it...
Dr. Mafune studied at this institute.
He was a brilliant biologist...
Thirty years ago, he published a plan
about the idea of undersea exploration...
This plan caught the world's attention...
He also tested ways in which
he could control animals...
But many of these tests
were unsuccessful...
One day, he issued a report on the discovery a
dinosaur living at the bottom of Ogasawara Bay...
The doctor named the
dinosaur, Titanosaurus...
He was sure he would
be able to control it...
In the end, it changed the Doctor's life...
And about 15 years ago...
...he ended his studies at the institute.
It was said that he left because
he pushed himself too hard...
Mr. Oota, what did you think
of Dr. Mafune's studies?
To control animals scientifically...
As a human being, I don't think we
have the right to wield such power.
I will always be opposed to it...
Sir, where does Dr. Mafune live?
He used to live in Manazuru. I
don't know where he is now.
Really? Thank you very much.
Mafune, huh? Oh, the lunatic
that lives in the mansion!
You're right. His mansion is
in the middle of that forest.
I haven't seen anyone there in a while...
And no one wants to go near that place!
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Is this Dr. Mafune's residence?
- Hey, wait!
Hello. Is this Dr. Mafune's residence?
I'd really like to see the Doctor. I'm...
He is dead.
He died?
Five years ago.
Excuse me... Excuse me, Miss!
I'm with the International
Police Organization.
He's from the Ocean
Exploration Research Institute.
I am Ichinose.
The truth is, we are interested in
the Doctor's research on a dinosaur.
Do you know anything about it?
A Dinosaur?
We believe it was the cause
of some attacks recently.
I'm sorry, but his office isn't here.
When father was alive, he did
not speak about his work.
You don't have anything we can look at?
Did your father leave
anything here from work?
I burned it all... when my father died.
Burned it?
Out of all of his notes, can you
remember anything you could tell us?
Please forgive me...
I do not want to think
about that incident.
That was strange... What was
she so bothered about?
Congratulations, Doctor.
This deserves a toast!
A toast!
Now that Titanosaurus'
control is complete...
...you've helped us make
this a very happy occasion.
No, no... I could not have completed
my research without your assistance.
Father, Interpol was just here.
What?
- Interpol?
They were interested in hearing
about your research on dinosaurs.
Well, their interest is
fifteen years too late...
Now I will make them all think!
I'll show them my theory was correct!
I'll wipe out the fools of the world who
thought I was mad! I'll show them all...!
Father...
Katsura, donÂ’t you worry about me...
Doctor, it's time to show you
what you were working for.
Me?
It's for your revenge...
The perfect weapon for you to use.
What in the world is that?
Mechagodzilla...
Mechagodzilla?
Then you're...
Yes...
We are spacemen from the
Third Planet of the Black Hole.
After Godzilla had defeated
Mechagodzilla the first time...
...we pulled it from the ocean
and began rebuilding it.
Doctor...
Let me introduce you
to our commander, Mugal.
I've waited for this moment, Dr. Mafune...
What do you think of
our science facilities?
This is a tremendous opportunity!
I am pleased that you think so.
Doctor, I have a favor to ask of you...
We would like you to give us the
control device that you have invented.
With your Titanosaurus
and our Mechagodzilla...
...we would achieve our
goals with little opposition.
A prisoner has escaped!
What?! Alright let's go!
It's alright. We will capture him
before he reaches any other humans.
Did you really think
you could escape? Fire!
Attaching weapons to the
sub will slow it down.
Our current sonar's range is about 500 meters.
We can try to expand it to 1 to 1.5 kilometers.
That way, we'll have an advanced warning
before the dinosaur gets too close.
Originally, Titanosaurus was not
considered an aggressive species.
It would not attack
anything on its own.
We found this book while searching
the area with Ichinose.
This is Dr. Mafune's notebook.
How about it, Wakayama...
Will one kilometer be enough?
Let me look into it.
Not particularly aggressive?
Oh, thank you.
Sorry for calling you here so urgently.
Well, thank you.
You didn't have to come.
The truth is, we've stumbled on some
notes that were written by the Doctor.
Here they are.
I've noticed that the Doctor's and
my own views were about the same.
Ichinose...
Please forget everything
about the Titanosaurus.
Both the Doctor's and my
findings are quite similar.
Who else could come
to these conclusions?
But...
Katsura, we are investigating this matter.
Investigating?
Yes, we are preparing
a second submarine.
You're going to investigate the dinosaur?
Yes. I was wondering if you
would come along as well.
That way we could prove
the Doctor's theory together.
Would you like to come along?
Stop, please! I beg of you!
I thought you would be
pleased with what I was doing...
Katsura! Come with me!
Katsura, have you forgotten?
I understand what I did.
You shouldn't be saying anything to
the humans you've met out there.
Father, Ichinose's and your
studies are very similar.
Katsura, will you forget about it?
Your mother did not want
you involved in my research.
For your own good, do not follow a single
word of it! Our poor and scorned lives...
The pain drove her to her death!
Katsura, we cannot turn
back from our course.
That man and his friends
are going to investigate it.
This is Yamashita from Shizuoka.
Thank you.
This gentleman wanted to hand over
this fragment he found at Mount Amagi.
This is space-titanium.
Analyze it to ensure there is no doubt.
Yes, sir...
But how did he get it?
I was working on the Yamagoya
underground water pipe when it happened.
The man pointed at a large scar on his throat
and motioned that he could not speak.
He wrote the word "Interpol" on his hand
and pushed me back into the access tank.
Moments later, several men chased
after him and tried to kill him.
The body looked as
if it was mowed down.
Did he die at Amagi?
Begin an immediate investigation!
Yes, sir!
Could he have survived the attack?
We'll know shortly, but he gave
Yamashita the vital clue we needed!
Here.
It's nearly complete, Doctor.
With Mechagodzilla fitted
with your control device...
...the greatest robot-monster will be born.
No, it needs one more thing
to become a great machine.
It needs living brain cells
in order for that to happen.
I see...
Just a moment Doctor... Was an
investigation launched to find Titanosaurus?
Katsura knows Titanosaurus
better than I ever will.
Then it will be okay?
Commander, do you...?
No, no. Don't mind me.
I'm sure Katsura wouldn't
do anything wrong.
The investigation team is
leaving today at 1 PM.
Yes, are you going? Why?
Is that so? I understand.
Please wait for me until we return
from searching for the dinosaur.
Ah! Hello? Dr. Mafune's...
The investigation team is leaving?
Why won't you come with
our investigation team? Why?
He can't go! He's in danger!
Katsura, you must keep your
head clear for a little longer.
Decide... You cannot let
this get under your skin.
Remember who saved you
when you were dying.
I'm finished! Katsura, it's
complete! I've completed it!
This is a great achievement!
Please have the
honor of activating it.
Alright!
Well, let's throw the switch! Ready?
Yes!
Katsura!
Katsura! Katsura!
Katsura!
What the...? Who are you?!
Your heart is made of wires and gears.
Who would ever love someone like that?
Forget about your human friend.
You should think about this...
You are your father's
remaining fountain of strength.
Would you remove such strength?
Revenge and hate...
Yes... Call out Titanosaurus. It
must attack the investigation team.
Forget about your
search for Titanosaurus!
Internal temperature, 18...
Hey, how's our status?
Ok...
What's wrong? What happened?
The gauge is going wild!
It's like a powerful magnetic force!
Ah, there!
Yes, that's it!
Attack!
It seems to be hurt!
Right! Lets get out of here!
Titanosaurus! Titanosaurus!
Damn earthlings!
The dinosaur slowed down suddenly?
Yes. The dinosaur's attack ended
as soon as we contacted the base.
We'd switched on all
of our transmitters.
The switch produced
many supersonic waves.
Then you think this might be a clue?
Yes.
The sound waves may
have had an affect on it.
Boss, we could create a machine that
transmits a powerful sound wave.
Alright. Let's propose the
countermeasure to headquarters.
You're in an awkward position.
You must be eliminated!
Buddy!
How dare you let the
earthlings escape from here!
Execute these pathetic bastards!
Move it!
Father...
What's wrong, Katsura?
It's Titanosaurus...
Titanosaurus? What's wrong with it?
It chased after the submarine
when something seemed to hurt it.
What?
What could hurt Titanosaurus?
Next, the sound device. We had a
problem with the directional emitter.
We wanted something that could
be aimed like a flashlight.
From the parabolic lens, we can concentrate
the sound waves into one particular beam.
We can redirect, reinforce and
increase its power dramatically.
We encountered a mysterious group
that attacked us at Mount Anagi.
They shot at us with weapons
that I've never seen before.
Were they spacemen?
I can't be sure of it.
Anyway, should we go on full alert?
Not until we find out
their true colors first.
Notify the Self Defense
Force about them.
What do you want with me?
These are my father's research notes.
I found them at my
father's house in Kanazawa.
Kanazawa? Did he live in Kanazawa?
I thought they would be a great help
to you with your research at the office.
Thank you.
This new data will benefit my research.
Won't you stay for some tea?
Yes.
So, the dinosaur really exists?
Yes it does, just like your father said.
I... I think the dinosaur
might be a vicious creature.
I had hoped my father was
wrong about his ideas.
It's alright! The
dinosaur has a weakness.
It can't stand supersonic waves.
Supersonic?
We're developing a supersonic gun
that we'll be able to use soon.
Then we will return
to our investigation.
A Supersonic gun?
I'd like to see that...
I'll show them Titanosaurus' true power!
Father...
Are you going to sell out
mankind to the spacemen?
Don't you know anything? It will become
one of the greatest destroyers of life!
Just like King Ghidorah,
Rodan and Manda!
Do you want Titanosaurus to be
a monster just like them?
Katsura...
I'm not only sending Titanosaurus
out just for Mugal's purpose...
I'm not bowing down to the spacemen!
Mechagodzilla is not
the enemy of Titanosaurus.
I want to prove to them
all that I was right!
I want to show those useless fools
at the academic society!
I want them to see the
proof that I was right!
Go... Titanosaurus!
That's it. Let's install it.
Right!
Units One and Two are ready to attack!
- Right!
This is horrible!
- It's pretty bad!
The wiring! The wiring is cut!
Damn!
Who could have done this?
Well, get this fixed
as quickly as possible!
Yes, sir!
Wakayama!
Titanosaurus has just come ashore!
Murakoshi, it happened!
Someone sabotaged the supersonic gun!
What? The supersonic gun?
Damn! Wakayama...
Without that, we have
no way to stop it!
You look over there!
- Yes, sir!
The Doctor has unleashed Titanosaurus
without waiting for his instructions!
I know...
Should we send a team to stop him?
This could affect our plans!
No, wait...
Look at this...
A super giger-counter!
Who is Mechagodzilla's greatest enemy?
Godzilla.
Correct... Look!
Godzilla is heading straight
for Titanosaurus now.
He will fight Titanosaurus and defeat him...
...but Godzilla won't have time
to regain his strength.
This time, in a single stroke,
we will attack Tokyo.
This is Mechagodzilla's revenge!
Prefect Ural wards 3 and 4, please report
to your ground shelters immediately!
Father!
Katsura! Katsura!
Katsura went to find
those notes just for me!
Maybe, but she was the only one besides
us who knew about the supersonic gun.
If you knew that, then why don't
you suspect me of the same thing?!
Katsura wasn't that type of person!
Ichinose!
Forget about it, she's dead now.
I still believe in her. What else
is there to say to you?
Ichinose!
Yamamoto!
Yamamoto, you've done
what you could.
Leave him alone for now...
Why didn't you wait
for my instructions?
It's alright...
Now you know that we both
have a common enemy.
Doctor... From now on you will
follow our orders in our battle.
Alright?
This is the second time you
saved my daughter's life...
I will do whatever you ask.
Will you be able to
repair the equipment?
Yes, I can. But it will take two days.
Two days?
This is the first lookout point and
here is the second lookout point.
Please keep someone posted at the
lookouts while we evacuate the civilians.
But we still won't have any weapon
capable of defeating Titanosaurus...
Please do what you can, quickly.
Wakayama, I beg of you.
Finish this in one day.
But, Boss...
No! One day! I can have anything
you need here within an hour.
Boss... Can I go to Amagi?
What for?
This time, it's their base!
Alright. I understand.
Doctor... Mechagodzilla's control
center is linked to Katsura.
When the earthmen finally
find this base...
I'll destroy it and
remove the problem.
I have arranged for it to explode as
soon as Mechagodzilla leaves the base.
From then on, Katsura will be
Mechagodzilla's control center.
Not even Interpol will
be able to find it.
Doctor... You told me
that in your opinion...
...Mechagodzilla would be
ineffective without living brain cells.
Now, Katsura's brain cells and
Mechagodzilla's mechanics are linked...
...creating a powerful cyborg.
Katsura's hate will turn Mechagodzilla's
hate into a powerful explosive force.
Doctor...
When this fight is over, you will be able
to live your life with your daughter.
We will build you the first building in a
new Tokyo, over the ashes of the old city.
Katsura!
Forgive me, Katsura.
Forgive me...
Katsura...
I'll complete the Doctor's
research for you. I will...
Katsura?!
Katsura, is that you?
And you are... the one
looking for Titanosaurus?
Who are you?
Mafune...
Dr. Mafune?!
You bastards! Let me go!
If you sit still, you can witness the
inevitable destruction of your city.
Bastards, What are you doing?!
We are saviors...
We will remove the weak humans from this
fouled earth and replace them with saviors.
Doctor!
How could you?!
I believed in your work!
Think of your pride!
It's too late for anything.
It's out of my hands!
Doctor!
Prepare to attack.
Well, Katsura...
Call Mechagodzilla...
Katsura!
We're too late! Damn! Wait!
Help us! Help us!
It's no use! Get back!
Hey, old man!
What's going on?!
An explosion? Alright, get
out of here, hurry!
Let's go!
Katsura, call Titanosaurus!
At this moment, the spacemen-controlled
Titanosaurus and Mechagodzilla...
... are invading the heart of the city!
Go Mechagodzilla and Titanosaurus!
Destroy the earthlings!
Those are rotation missiles.
Mechagodzilla has new weapons.
Incredible! Where is Godzilla?
Stop! Stop, Gen!
It's dangerous!
No, it's alright!
I'll go on by myself!
Okay, I'm going too.
Help us!
- Godzilla help us!
Isn't it done yet?!
I'm connecting the circuits!
We're leaving.
- Good luck!
There's nothing wrong.
Good.
Yes, that's it!
Dr. Mafune completed his invention.
That's why Titanosaurus isn't gentle...
Base! Base! This is Murakoshi!
I'm heading for Munazuru.
Send troops to Dr. Mafune's home!
That's it Titanosaurus! Stomp your
foe Godzilla beneath your feet!
Katsura...
Katsura, you're not yourself.
Be silent...
Look there!
Ready to fire!
Fire!
Fight!
Fight, Titanosaurus!
What's wrong?!
Doctor!
Mechagodzilla, a little more!
Commander!
What's wrong?
The Defense Force is
approaching this area!
What?
Mechagodzilla!
Damn!
Titanosaurus...
Fight, Titanosaurus!
Katsura!
You are mistaken.
Katsura, you can't!
You are mistaken!
You're not who I think you are?
No...
I'm not the human you think I am.
Katsura!
Don't move!
Ichinose, are you okay?!
Katsura...
Katsura...
Katsura!
Doctor!
Katsura!
Father!
Father!
Don't move!
It's alright. It's alright.
Even though you are a
cyborg, I still love you.
It's not your fault...
It's not your fault!
You... You are a human.
You'd never lose the
heart of a human being!
I beg you... Please kill me!
The mechanism that controls
Mechagodzilla is inside of me!
But... if I were... to be killed...
Idiot! I won't do it!
I won't do it... I won't do it!
Katsura!
Katsura...
Well fire!
Do you think your bullets have
a chance of killing the great Mugal?
Fire!
We did it!
We did it!
We've done it!
