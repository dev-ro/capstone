(BIRDSONG)
Don't you stop, mate.
Gimme.
Whoo-hoo! Been playing poker?
You Air Force pussy boys
wanna play for cash?
(BIRDSONG)
Fuck!
I can't even deal myself
a good hand.
Bets. I don't have any more.
So, check, then.
Check. OK.
I'll check too, then.
Show us your cards, Mikey.
Pair of Queens.
Full house. (LAUGHS)
Let's just call me moneybags!
Mullah, man!
Give it back, man. I need it.
It's not my money. I've gotta pick
my mum's prescription up.
Shouldn't gamble
if he can't afford to lose it.
Don't be a shit. Just give it back.
You know his mum's sick. You've
still got the rest of the money.
OK, I'll give you
your ten bucks back.
If... you jump.
I can't do that, man.
I-I'm afraid of heights.
And the rocks move. It'll be fine,
bro. Three steps. We checked it out.
Just give me the fucking money, man!
What fucking money?
Any money around here belongs to me.
Cough it up.
What are you playing, 52 pick up?
Piss off, Victor.
Paul, tell your brother Jake won
that money fair and square.
Shut your mouth, septic.
I'll bash you just for fun.
You got any money?
We could play a hand.
(SCOFFS SOFTLY)
(BIRDSONG)
Two. Two. Three.
Three.
All right... show you cards.
Pair of Aces.
(BIRDSONG) What've you got?
Three nines. Let's go, boys!
(LAUGHTER) Fuck you!
(GROANS)
(HUBBUB)
Oh, shit! Fuck!
Be safe, boys!
(ALL HOLLER)
Whoo!
Foley! I'll fucking get you!
I will fucking find you! Fuck!
Fuck!
Come on! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
Hey, Mikey? Yeah.
Here's your tenner. For what?
You jumped! I didn't mean to.
(BOTH LAUGH)
(WAVES CRASH)
(WAVES CRASH)
(SHUTTER CLICKS)
I'm at the gallery.
No, no, just dropped something off.
Excuse me?
OK? Bye.
Yeah. Sorry?
(LAUGHS SOFTLY) No, I'm sorry.
This is gonna sound really odd,
but I wanna thank you. I took these
shots of you in the gallery.
And I really am sorry.
I just saw the way
you were looking at the art.
There was just something
in the way you were taking it in.
Can I buy you a coffee or something?
Can we talk?
I don't want a coffee.
Do you know what the Archibald is?
It's a portrait prize. Yeah.
Yeah? I wanna paint you for that.
But, technically, we've gotta
spend a bit of time together.
Thing is, there's a form that needs
to be signed, and I don't have it,
but maybe... you could just say,
"Alira Morley has permission
to paint my portrait."
You just have to say your name.
The competition's not for six
months, so I've got plenty of time.
Alira Morley has permission
to paint my porch.
OK, I'm gonna go that way. No, not
yet. You gotta say your name.
Jake Foley.
Could you maybe say your age
and what you do? Is that OK?
I'm 57.
And I'm a gambler.
(LAUGHS SOFTLY) Is that for real?
You're a gambler? Yeah.
Like on sports, horses, greyhounds,
that kind of thing?
No.
I play poker.
(LAUGHS SOFTLY) Right on!
Well, thanks.
Maybe if I make the shortlist,
I'll see you at the exhibition?
No, you won't.
An object won't change its motion
Unless a force acts on it.
That's one of Newton's laws.
From the time we were teenagers,
Mikey, Alex. Paul, Drew and I.
From the time we were teenagers,
Mikey, Alex. Paul, Drew and I
were an inseparable band of pirates.
But for quite a while now,
Life and circumstance...
have been pulling us apart.
And time is running out
to apply the force
that would bring us back together.
Of all the boys,
my best friend was Drew.
We had a lot in common.
Our dad's were Air Force pilots,
We liked to take risks, and we both
love card games, specifically poker.
Five card draw, seven card stud,
Texas Hold'em, Omaha,
Razz, Badugi, Chinese,
deuce to seven triple draw,
any kind of poker.
When the first personal computers
came along,
we were all over it, adapting them
to suit us,
Writing our own programs
for the games we wanted to play.
And in '94, we set up the world's
first online poker system.
When the larger markets
opened to us...
When the larger markets
opened to us
that was a waterfall.
More money
than we'd ever dreamed of.
Then Drew hit on something else.
By restructuring the code
from cards to countries,
he retooled the program
Into a sale able military grade
surveillance software.
We called it RIFFLE.
Shit name, I know.
Our customers are governments.
(BIRDSONG)
But life's just a game, right?
It's all in how you read
and respond to your opponents.
You watch how they bet,
how much they bet.
Everything they do informs you more.
If luck is leaving you, apply
what you can to change its motion.
Hey, I'm Jake.
Keep walking.
Maximise your wins,
minimise your losses...
Maximise your wins,
minimise your losses,
and stay in the game
as long as you can.
I'm Paje.
You can call me Bill. Jake.
Yeah.
Did you bring something else
to wear? Yeah. Yeah.
This is your space.
Join me outside.
(SIGHS)
The medicine is telling me
you're not ready yet.
So we wait.
We can talk if you want.
(BIRDSONG)
I'll talk, then.
Most people come here...
for the shared experience.
Safety in numbers.
A shared journey.
There are only three types of people
who come here.
There are only three types of people
who come here
for a private appointment.
There's the morbidly famous
who are afraid of their own shadow.
The drug fucked
who quite mistakenly think
this is the next great high.
And the incurably curious.
Now, I don't recognise your face.
You don't appear to be in need.
But there is a weight on you
And... it's related
to your mortality.
How am I doing so far?
100%.
Death is inevitable.
All living things will die.
You have to recognise that
with relief.
Embrace that knowledge.
In my entire life
the time I've spent
pondering my own mortality
Would add up to minutes, if that.
Maybe when my wife Allison died,
I... I did ask the universe a lot
of questions then.
I never got
any satisfactory answers.
The answers don't always have
the structure we expect.
Sometimes,
the insistence of the question
Can drown out the response.
Let's go and untie some knots.
(BIRDSONG)
(WHISPERING)
The next few years.
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)
Over the next few days, there will
always be someone here with you.
Sometimes the body wants to merge.
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING) ..is for
what comes out of your mouth.
(WAVES CRASH)
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)
You will know
when it's time to drink.
(WHISTLES)
Reject the quest
for your question...
Reject the quest
for your question
to the front of your mind.
You will know
When it's time.
(HARMONICA PLAYS)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER / BOTH LAUGH)
Opening up to yourself...
is one thing.
Opening up to others
may still be hard.
When the time's right...
When the time's right
you might be able to use this.
What is it?
Let's just call it a truth serum.
A couple of drops and you'll say
what's on your mind.
Perfectly harmless in small doses.
You're sweating.
It can unlock doors.
It would take 10mls or more...
It would take 10mls or more
directly injected to be lethal.
(BIRDSONG)
Some people take comfort.
Some people take comfort
in knowing that they have...
some means of control.
(WAVES CRASH)
(WIND WHIPS)
(GRUNTING)
Hone that strength. (GRUNTING)
Go! (GRUNTS)
Good, girl. Break there.
(PANTS)
Ready?
(PANTS)
Hey, you.
You got in here like a ninja.
I didn't hear one step.
What are you doing?
Just checking out the house,
making sure everything's ready. Oh.
Yes, big poker game.
You haven't done that in years.
Yeah, well, they've been busy,
I've been busy, that's all.
Anyway, taking a break from old
friends sometimes
just reminds you how much they
mean to you. I love those guys.
They are just as much
my posse of delinquent uncles.
They are just as much
my posse of delinquent uncles
as they are your school buddies. I
will make sure they hear that, baby.
I have a more serious question.
Does it involve cash?
Am I your favourite child
and most special daughter?
I can guarantee that,
mainly because you are
my only child and only daughter.
Hmm. As your favourite child
and most special daughter,
There's the cutest denim jacket
down in the arcade. Mm-hm.
So I was wondering...
Yeah. Yeah.
It's cuter than that.
Hmm.
Look at what you've built.
Mum would have been so proud of you.
Hey, come on...
Hey, come on
don't get yourself upset.
Your mum... is with us every day.
She sees everything.
And you know what, she'd much
rather see you laughing than crying.
I just miss her.
I didn't think
I could live... a day without her,
let alone ten years.
Jake. Sam. (SIGHS)
Let me see. Fuck!
Now... if you decide
on a testamentary trust,
and we know
that time is of the essence,
then you will have to nominate
a trustee. That trustee
can be a person or persons,
an organisation or a trust company.
If you still wanna explore the idea
of a charitable trust,
then, in addition, the trustee
will have to nominate... (FADES OUT)
(CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)
(CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)
(CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)
(CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)
The trust administrator
will report back,
And defend the rights
of your beneficiaries.
Now, look, I know this is a lot
to take in.
If you do the structure right, I
guarantee it'll be tight as a drum.
And in regards to tonight,
everything's in place.
I'm gonna meet the guys
down in the garage in ten minutes.
Once I'm done, I'll meet you at
the pad. The pilot's standing by.
Good.
Have you told Drew?
Not all the details, no.
Devil's advocate.
Tonight is all very elaborate, Jake.
You certain
you wanna go through with it?
And this time I'm not asking
as your lawyer.
Plenty of people get by
with flowers and cards. (SIGHS)
Well, they might not be the best
decisions I've ever made,
but at least I won't live
to regret them.
See you down there.
"(WOMAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY)"
Yes.
Sorry.
What for?
It was necessary.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Minister. Minister. The report
on Family Affairs released today.
Minister. Minister. The report
on Family Affairs released today
seems to contradict the stated
intentions of your department
just earlier this year.
Beverly, what you're really saying
is the press contrived
to misunderstand
the position we took last year.
My department is putting the needs
of lower-income families first.
And I know you personally support
that, Beverly. No, minister...
Minister!
Did you get the text? What the fuck
are we doing meeting in a car park?
I thought we were
meeting in the penthouse.
Hello, Paul. Good to see you too.
(Sorry.) (LAUGHS)
Maybe the car park's where the
private lift is, Minister? Yeah,
course it is. Let's do this.
You wanna wait for Alex? That
arselicker's probably already here.
You look like shit, by the way.
(LAUGHS) Tremendous.
Beautiful.
(SIGHS)
(Hey.)
OK? Yeah.
You just have to tell him.
Get it done.
Yeah.
(DISTANT SIREN)
It's on tonight, all right.
Just... don't forget the gear.
You never know
who you're gonna bump into, Billy.
Some old mate you owe a favour to.
Look, this bloke's different,
he's Polish or something,
But we need him. He's connected
and he knows what's what.
So just don't use your prison charm,
OK?
That's all I'm asking, mate,
just nice and easy.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Gentlemen. (LAUGHTER) Alex.
How are you, mate?
I'm good. You?
(LAUGHTER) The annoying one's
apologised. Nice to meet you.
So, are are we going upstairs or...?
Actually, Jake thought.
So, are are we going upstairs or...?
Actually, Jake thought
you might like to meet him down at
Pebble Cove.
So he would like you guys to pick
a car to drive.
Anyone you like. You're kidding?
Keys are all in 'em. SatNavs are
programmed with the scenic route.
Travel time's about 90 minutes,
but Jake would like you to think
of it as a race.
Jakey, Jakey, Jakey!
Where are you going?
Mike, I'm Sam. Hey, Sam.
Cars! You keep away,
that thing's mine.
You keep away. (LAUGHTER)
So, have you caught up with Jake
much lately.
Oh, not much. I've...
I've been travelling.
A coupla book tours and such.
Yeah.
Yeah, life gets busy, eh?
Yeah, it does. (LAUGHS)
Mike, I'm afraid,
I'm gonna have to drive you.
(LAUGHS) You're kidding me?
It was a fucking sip!
(ENGINE REVS) Ahh!
We're taking that one.
Nice choice.
Is anyone gonna say go?
(ENGINE REVS / (TYRES SCREECH)

(ROTORS WHIR)
(RINGING)
Hey. You good?
"Yeah, brother. How you all doing?"
You gonna tune in tonight?
"Right on showtime.
Look, Jake, are you really sure you
want it to go down this way, man?"
There needs to be a catalyst.
We haven't had
an honest conversation in years.
And I don't have time to wait around
for these guys to get comfortable
enough to tell me the truth.
"Yeah... I get it, brother."
See you soon. "Yeah, see you."
(ROTORS WHIR)
(ENGINE REVS) Fuck me, mate!
Everything OK? Super car race
with a soft cock for a chauffeur.
(LAUGHS) Everything's peachy!
Yeah, all the specs say
we have the fastest car.
Mm-hm. It's got a race engine.
You're in a race.
Maybe put your fucking foot down!
(ENGINE REVS)
(LAUGHS)
(ENGINE REVS)
(ENGINE REVS)
(COMMS CRACKLE)
There are fresh ingredients
in the fridge if you wanna cook.
Everything you need
for grilled oysters
is in the fridge by the barbecue.
Great. Is Penelope here?
Yes, she is. Downstairs, sir.
The guests are gonna be arriving
in three separate cars.
Meet them in the garage, take them
to their rooms down the backstairs.
No problem. After that, you guys
can take the night off.
Put the gate on code only.
Hello, Mr Jake. Everything good?
Everything in place, sir? Great.
I think I might cook tonight.
You sure you wanna do that, Mr Jake?
I'll try not to make a mess.
"Hello."
Thank fuck! Did you get my message?
Don't go to the house tonight.
The plan has changed.
"I'm not changing plans.
Everything's been organised."
No, no, you have to change the plan.
I thought the house would be empty.
He'll be there.
"It's going ahead.
Time to clear your debt."
No, it can't go ahead tonight!
You hear me? He'll be there!
I'll be there.
It's too close! He'll know.
Please, man, just back the fuck off!
Fuck! Fuck! (ENGINE REVS)
(TYRES SCREECH)
(TYRES SCREECH / ENGINE REVS)
(TYRES SCREECH)
(ENGINE REVS)
Having fun, Mr Foley?
(BIRDSONG)
(SIGHS)
Penelope.
Did Sam tell you what's going on?
Only that it's big stakes.
Did Sam tell you what's going on?
Only that it's big stakes
and that I'll probably finish early.
He didn't elaborate.
RFID chips. Live and legal tender.
Cash.
Five equal stacks, Texas Hold'em.
Yes, boss.
(CICADAS CHIRRUP)
Yes, of course.
Hey, look... I gotta go.
Bye. Love you.
(SIGHS)
(CICADAS CHIRRUP)
(KNOCK AT DOOR) Mikey! Let's go!
You all right? Yep.
Let's hit it.
(LAUGHS) There he is. Alex.
Good to see you, Jake. Hiya.
Paul.
Jakey boy. Always a pleasure.
Mike.
Jake. Look at this! (LAUGHS)
OK?
All good, Mr Foley? All good, Chris.
See you tomorrow.
You do know there are other wines
beside Henschke.
Yeah, I have a rule with wine, don't
buy it unless you're gonna drink it.
I knew you would say something like
that, so small vineyard,
McLaren Vale shiraz. Nice.
A velvet glove.
Hmm. Salute. It's been too long.
Cheers, lads.
To Drew and to you Jake.
(ALL) Absent friends.
How is Drew? Good.
Mmm! How were the cars?
Oh, that Maybach is amazing!
I put my foot down and I was here.
(LAUGHS) Yeah, I wouldn't know
how mine was to drive,
cos you sent the fucking fun police
over there. (ALL LAUGH)
Well, I'm glad you liked the cars,
because they're yours.
My gift. What?
I mean, that Maybach
is a million-dollar car, Jake.
Forgive my cynicism, but what's
the catch? There's no catch.
I just thought we'd have a bit
of fun and up the stakes tonight.
The cars are yours,
titles signed over to you,
or... you can give up the dream car
and exchange it,
For $5 million in chips each.
Holy shit! $5 million?
Texas Hold'em.
Winner take all.
There's a couple of wrinkles. One,
you have to play, you can't sit out.
Two, if one of you wants to keep
the car, then that's that.
It's one in, all in, and we'll
just play for our usual stakes.
Fuck! Which car came first?
The Maybach.
That puts you on the button, Alex.
You just gotta make the decision.
Do you want the car,
or do you want the chips?
I'll leave you to discuss it.
Sam, can answer your questions?
Just remember, if you do play
you have to accept the outcome.
If you don't play
You have to accept
that outcome too.
(LAUGHS)
W-Wait. Before we start,
We can't do this. Can't do what?
We can't take the cars. You're damn
right we can't take the cars.
It's five million in chips. It's
poker night, let's fucking go!
We can't take the cars or the chips.
This is crazy!
I mean, let's just play
for our normal stakes, eh?
I don't wanna feel like
I owe Jake anything.
This is five million in chips each.
Right, Sam? Mm-hm.
So, what's it gonna be, gents?
25 million on the table.
Who are these guys?
The guys I grew up with.
I'm giving 'em
a couple of the big experiences,
and fucking with their heads
for old times' sake.
They will probably say stupid shit.
When they drink, OK?
And they'll flirt with the bedposts
if they think they've half a chance.
Mikey, wait. Just...
(SIGHS)
This is too much.
You know, I'm doing OK,
I don't need this.
I'm happy for you, Alex,
that you're doing OK,
that your books are selling,
that's great.
I'm not doing OK.
And I wanna play.
Just say yes, Alex. Fine.
What about you, Paul?
I think we should... just say yes,
Alex.
Mm-hm.
(SIGHS)
They're in. Good.
We're doing this. (LAUGHS)
Yeah, we're doing this.
You don't do things by halves, Jake.
Cheers. Cheers.
It's just a game, Alex.
This is a beautiful drop.
Sweet Jesus! (LAUGHS) Fuck me!
Not that I don't appreciate the
wine, Jake, it's fucking lovely,
but I'll grab myself
a poker player's drink.
Take the bottle. Cheers.
Let's go, eh?
There's a humidor over there
if you like. Don't mind if I do.
Hello. I'm Michael.
I'm Penelope.
Are you left or right-handed?
I'm right.
You'll be fine.
(SIGHS)
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm your dealer for tonight.
My name is Penelope.
Hello, Penelope, I'm Paul.
Hi, Paul. Alex. Alex.
On my right hand here, Michael.
It's a five million buy in.
No rebuys. Texas Hold'em.
Winner takes all. We will start
the small blind at 25,000,
the big blind at 50,000.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Good luck to you all.
So, if you love art so much,
then why do you steal it?
To possess it.
Even just briefly, to be close
enough to smell the canvas,
to touch the brush strokes,
To have possessed it.
Maybe it's just a bit too obtuse
and deep for you, Billy.
Maybe you're just not smart enough
to understand.
I'm smart enough to know
which part of your face
Is gonna bleed the most.
(SIGHS)
Fucking ferret!
Here comes the target.
(ENGINE STARTS)
Call. Call.
Raise... 175.
Raise 175,000.

Michael?
(LAUGHS SOFTLY) A quick game
is a good game, eh, Jake?
Thanks for the invite.
I call. All in.
(SIGHS) First fucking hand.
(LAUGHS) Ten million in the pot.
Oh!
Oh, you both have the same cards.
Jack and ten. Michael has hearts,
Jake has diamonds.
We have a straight
or a possible flush draw on both.
(ALL LAUGH)
Split pot, gentlemen.
(Fuck me!)
(LAUGHTER) Right down the middle.
Straight down the middle.
(DISTANT SIREN)
(ENGINE REVS)
Talking about you walking
from Melbourne to Sydney,
For about 25 fucking years.
(LAUGHTER)
And the bit of the story
I've never figured out,
you didn't actually complete
the journey? Oh, I did, yeah.
(LAUGHTER) I did. I did.
In a car. (LAUGHTER)
Start telling that story
in the future about the walk you
did from Melbourne to Sydney,
Tell the story about the walk from
Melbourne to Orbost. That's right.
(LAUGHTER)
It is false advertising, mate.
It's a big title, and the story
doesn't live up to the title.
Absolutely false advertising.
A bit like your last book.
(LAUGHTER / PHONE BUZZES)
And then he proceeded to offer me
this... cigarette.
Did you imbibe? I did.
I thought it would be rude not to.
So, anyway, I don't feel
particularly different,
until later that night, I went
upstairs to the restaurant,
and I'm watching this band,
and then I turn around
And look out the window, and I came
back and there's the kitchen.
The band's fucking disappeared!
So I look out the window again,
there's the band again.
And I'm fucking falling over
all the time going,
"I must be really
out of my mind here."
It took me about an hour to realise
That it was a revolving rooftop
restaurant. (LAUGHTER)
You fucking idiot! I know.
That's brilliant!
And that was my start in politics.
(ALL LAUGH)
Oh, fuck off! (LAUGHTER)
(CICADAS CHIRRUP)
Mr Foley
left me a gift in my locker.
No, I'm gonna show you
when I get home.
(ENGINE REVS)
We can go anywhere you want.
Look, I'm excited.
You've gotta see it to believe it.
Look, I'm on my way home now,
I'll see you soon.
(TYRES SCREECH)
What's going on, man?!
(ENGINE REVS / TYRES SCREECH)
We get to Vegas,
we get to the hotel rooms,
so I start go ogling...
arse problems.
(LAUGHTER) Caution! Caution!
My arse is in danger!
Right. Every time
you flinch your sphincter,
it was like an electric shock
through my body.
We get to this specialist, and I lay
down, and Alex is there with me.
Thank you, Alex. And I lay down,
And he has a look at it.
He's like, "Oh, yep!"
"Yeah, you've got
a perianal abscess." Ohh!
It was a terrific weekend in Vegas,
wasn't it, Alex? (LAUGHTER)
(PHONE RINGS) "Hey, Bec."
When were you going to tell me?
Er, hey, I'm driving,
this is some pretty big stuff.
Just let me pull over and we can
talk properly.
I'm a kid, is that it? I can't
handle reality or something?
"(SOBS) What's the reason
for keeping me in that dark?"
Listen, kiddo...
Listen, kiddo
about five months ago...
This is really hard.
Your dad had a vasectomy. OK?
"He didn't... He just did it,
he didn't discuss it with me."
Now I've always known
that your dad, he...
Now I've always known
that your dad, he
he loves you so much. And he didn't
wanna complicate your life
"With a half-sibling
when you were younger."
But I always thought that
we would eventually get the chance
to have a baby.
So the vasectomy news
that was, er
I've been in his office
looking at his medical records.
He was diagnosed in September.
He was diagnosed in September
with pancreatic cancer.
"He's dying!
(SOBS) He's dying!"
He wasn't going to tell me!
It's OK, Bec,
I'm gonna come and get you, OK?
"(SOBS)"
Just stay where you are, OK?
It's OK, honey, I'm coming.
I'm gonna come and get you and then
we'll both go and talk to your dad
together, OK?
500. (INDISTINCT CHATTER)
(BEEPING / LAUGHTER) Hey, Sam,
go and check that out for me.
The door might not be closed,
it's activating the system.
Yeah, no problem.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER / LAUGHTER)
(SIGHS)

(GROANS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Anyone of you motherfuckers
gonna deal me in? Drew!
(LAUGHTER) Drew! Hey, Drew!
(LAUGHTER)
What's up, brother? How you doing?
What's up, brother? (LAUGHTER)
Get the man a drink.
What are you having, Drew?
Tequila on ice, slice of pineapple.
Alrighty. He likes his fruit.
(BOTH GROAN) Hey. Some things
I need to catch you up on.
Yeah, I'm seeing the big money move.
(LAUGHTER)
I know I said I wasn't
gonna make it, but...
Are we gonna keep playing?
No, I don't think so.
(LAUGHTER) Where's she going?
We're still playing, aren't we?
(LAUGHTER)
Fuck me! (INDISTINCT CHATTER)
(SIGHS)
Jake asked me to turn RIFFLE
on to you guys this week.
Why would you turn a military grade
surveillance program me on us?
At first it was just for laughs,
maybe catch you scratching
your balls in your driveway,
show it on poker night. But RIFFLE
doesn't stop,
it crisscrosses your cell phones,
home security, computers.
Now, I'm not saying
we know everything,
but we know enough to get me
on a motherfucking plane.
I feel sick!
I'm not surprised, Alex.
I poisoned you.
On the base
of your toasting glasses.
It would have got on your hands...
your faces.
And now it's in your bloodstream.
That's not funny.
Are you serious?!
Poisoned? Fuck off, he's joking.
Is he?
I'm sweating like a motherfucker.
I don't feel too good.
First signs are sweating
Loss of balance, nausea, and then...
Then what?
Stop fucking around.
You want us dead?
I've been diagnosed with an
inoperable pancreatic cancer.
It's a death sentence.
So now we're all on the same level.
Touch pad. Bring him over.
Beautiful.
You've done the job for me.
Jesus! Fuck!
What the fuck, Mikey? What was you
gonna do, shoot us? Shoot Jake? Me.
I was gonna shoot me.
That was the plan.
I was gonna say goodbye to you
all and... shoot myself.
Is this about the business? You
think, we was gonna let you drown?
Why didn't you reach out? Yeah. I
had no idea you were this unhappy.
I put back two bottles of vodka
a day, Alex.
That's not the habit
of a happy person.
I'm all right with death.
I'm not!
I have a wife and kids.
I've got people who depend on me.
What is the code?
I can't tell you.
What's the code?
You want another one?
What is the fucking code?
Car! Car, car!
Get rid of the van! Come on.
(MUSIC PLAYS ON THE RADIO)
(GROANS)
I said get down! Get down!
Hey... no noise, you hear me?
Right, when the car goes through,
Jumped in front of the gates,
stop 'em from closing.
(MUMBLES) What?
(GASPS) It doesn't work that way,
it keeps going.
The gate can crush the car.
Is that right? (GROANS) Thanks.
(MUSIC PLAYS)
You got a bunch of bank accounts,
Paul. Savings, checking,
all on zero. How's that taking care
of your family?
I'm being blackmailed.
They've got video of me with a girl.
If it comes out, I'm
I gave them all the money I have,
they want more than I have.
(GROANS)
Tell me the code. (GASPS)
(PANTS) Tell me the code
or you're gonna get crushed!
Fucking hurry up, mates. Tell me the
code or you're gonna get crushed.
Oi! Code. You're gonna turn into
a puddle in a minute. Code.
Tell him! (GROANS)
(WHIRRING) (GASPS)
1967!
(BEEPING / CRUNCHING)
I thought we were just here
to steal, we are murderers now?
You'll only get manslaughter
at most.
And after you couldn't give the
dude no more money, what did you do?
What did you give 'em, Paul?
Jake.
Email addresses, phone numbers
sensitive information.
I was just trying to buy time.
I promise, Jake. I'm sorry, man.
Who's blackmailing you?
Victor. Your brother?!
Yeah, my brother.
I'm just so fucking ashamed!
(GUN COCKS / WHIRRING)
Oh, fuck! (BEEPING) What is it?
(BEEPING / WHIRRING)
(SIGHS)
I'm having an affair.
A terribly inexact word.
Insufficient.
It was never my intention
to deliberately betray anyone.
What happened to me, Jake,
is that I fell in love.
It just so happens I fell in love
with the woman you're married to.
I can't die.
We're having a baby.
I can't die.
You're not gonna fucking die.
Not tonight, anyway.
I just used a couple of drops,
nowhere near enough to kill you.
Just enough to fuck you up
and get you thinking.
It'll wear off soon.
I just wanted you for a moment
to feel where I am.
To see things through my eyes.
My little girl
is about to be hit by a train.
And there's nothing
I can do about it...
And there's nothing
I can do about it
cos I am the train.
So how long have you got, man?
Long enough to finish the game?
(LAUGHTER) Fuck!
Lawyers recommend trust funds so
they can keep charging annual fees.
In fact, in most instances, simply
transferring money
is a tax-free gift
to any normal bank account.
That's the better option.
You fucking guys don't get it.
Jake and I brought you into
the company at the ground level.
Mikey, you sold your shares in a
week. Alex traded his for a Rolex.
And Paul goes to Vegas first class.
Now, if it was up to me,
I would have given you all
that we put aside for you.
And I told him, "Chill the fuck out,
let's just start them with half."
Because we know you motherfuckers.
What do you mean?
We've still got shares? Yeah.
How much?
$25 million in poker chips.
Get fucked!
(CICADAS CHIRRUP)
(BEEPING) Erm, Jake?
What the fuck?
I hope this isn't another one
of your surprises, Jake? No.
It's Victor. He's here for the art.
Ah, fuck!
When you said then house
was full of Australian art,
did you mean pieces like this?
They don't know where we are,
Let's fuck off before they find
the stairs. Through the cellar.
Aboriginal art is not my forte.
Are they worth anything?
Well, yes, some of them are.
Very expensive, but...
the market for this art
attracts a certain type of buyer
who connects with it
on a spiritual plane.
It's a big house, find us something
we can sell.
Do you think the place is empty?
Three cars came in, four came out,
all different cars.
Shush! Don't fucking shush me!
They have guns.
Don't worry about that.
Warhol.
Well, he's famous, right?
Too famous.
It's a Sunday B Morning print.
A couple of grand retail if that.
Not for us.
(MUTTERS)
(Oh!) Not bad.
Henry James John stone.
Hard to find in this condition.
Look at the way
he painted the light.
He came to Australia
to mine for gold,
ironically, became a photographer.
Valuable? Hmm.
We could probably sell them.
It wouldn't be a big ticket, though.
Oi!
Stairs down here.
Shh!
"All right, here we go."
You want a drink?
Somebody already has.
Oh. (LAUGHS)
Look at this! Nice!
And this is a fucking
two storeys underground. Boom!
Nobody's home. Yes, there is.
This cigar didn't light itself.
(SNIFFS)
There's a lot of eye candy in here.
They're hiding somewhere.
Billy, check around.
OK, we got the guns, let's stop
these fuckers. I don't have guns.
You got a panic room, no firearms?
I've got a panic room
so I don't need firearms.
Victor, they probably
just fucked off. Look around!
OK.
Victor.
Victor, look at this room, man!
Top dollar!
It's like Ali Baba's cave, man!
What am I looking at?
1889. Melbourne.
9x5 Impression exhibition.
182 works painted mainly
on cigar box lids.
They sold for a guinea each,
a couple of bucks.
Tom Roberts, Arthur Street on,
Charles Conder.
You've hit the trifecta!
Now you are looking at three million
at auction, easy.
Grey market to us,
high six figures.
(CHUCKLES) Happy days!
I know you're still here, Jake.
Ha! Yes, you fucking are,
aren't you!
Hello, Jake. It's been a while.
Aren't you gonna say
hey to an old mate?
We ain't gonna hurt anyone,
we're just gonna take the art.
Ask the Minister why it's safer
not to call the cops.
Why the fuck are we on TV?
Because our host
is still somewhere in the house.
Check up those stairs.
What else is in here?
We were just gonna hit this place
in darkness.
Nothing personal. Then Paul said.
Nothing personal. Then Paul said
you were gonna be here
and I thought, "Fuck it!
I wanna make it personal!"
A panic room? You can't shoot
a motherfucker with it.
We've got Mike's gun.
It's only got one bullet.
I was planning on killing myself,
you only need one bullet for that.
Clarice Beckett. Genius!
We can move these in a heartbeat.
Another Street on.
William Do bell.
Woman In Restaurant.
Last sold for 935,000!
John Peter Russell! So rare!
He had hardly ever exhibited.
Classmate of Lautrec and Van Gogh.
He destroyed 400 of his masterworks
in grief when his wife died.
This is real fucking money!
How much?
Even at bargain basement,
we are walking away
With a couple of million.
(LAUGHS)
You hear that, Jake?
We know what you've got here!
Oi. The stairs lead to the kitchen.
I didn't see anyone there.
Just like I haven't seen anyone out
here or in the garage.
And you know what that is, Victor?
Cos there's no one fucking here.
Help Styx.
Let's go!
Jake, there's six of us and three of
them, we can take 'em.
It's only fucking Victor.
They've got three shotguns
against one bullet.
Let's just stay down here
until he fucks off, OK?
The more adrenalized he gets,
the harder that drug's gonna hit.
(SIGHS)
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
(WHIRRING)
So, what's this worth?
A couple of hundred K maybe.
He painted a lot Street on. Even
with a less significant work,
he leaves his mark of genius. Look.
A lot of people believe that these
marks of reflection.
A lot of people believe that these
marks of reflection
are Street on painting a portrait of
himself painting the glass.
You see? It's like a man leaning
over an easel.
So, our mate had a green head,
did he?
I tell ya, there's a really good
painting in the kitchen.
It's a couple of men playing cards,
one's smoking a pipe,
wearing funny hats. That's the type
of painting I like. You know why?
Hmm? Cos it tells a fucking story.
A couple of blokes playing poker,
they're on the piss,
they're talking shit.
I mean,
that's just a fucking goblet.
A white pipe? Yeah.
A tall hat? Yeah, a funny hat.
(BEEPING) Fuck!
Jesus! What's she doing here?
Billy! Visitors.
Who's this, Jake?
Plan's changed. Give me the gun.
There's only one bullet in it, man.
They don't know that. Mikey, we're
gonna go with your plan.
I'll bluff this prick and I'll split
'em up. I'll come with you.
Get the door, Mike.
Dad? Dad?
Hello, ladies.
Oh, hello, ladies!
(GROANS) Come on, come here.
Come here. (SCREAMS)
(GROANS) Get off!
(GROANS) Come here. Argh!
(SCREAMS) Shit!
Come here! (BOTH GROAN)
(SCREAMS) Come...
Come here you...
(ALL GROAN)
Come here!
(PANTS)
(SIGHS) (PANTS)
Victor. Victor.
Victor! The painting in the kitchen
is a fucking Cezanne!
(PANTS)
That's a $200 million item!
Who are we dealing with here?
People who own art like that have
got many ways of fucking you up.
Go... away!
My lucky day after all.
You know, things were looking dull
as shit till you turned up.
(PANTS) Well, this changes things,
doesn't it, Jake?
I'm assuming you know these women.
Come on in here, you prick!
Do you hear me, Jake?
Get your arse in here! (WHIMPERS)
What the fuck, man?!
Dad! Shit! (WHIMPERS)
Who the fuck is this?! Our host.
Jake... Fucking... Foley!
Lok at you, Big Shot. You come into
the room, gun in your hand,
like a common criminal. Victor.
I see you're the same shit magnet
Who goes around stealing
other people's stuff.
Don't get too cocky, Foley, you've
got three shotguns trained on you,
You can't get all of us!
I'm only aiming at you, Victor.
Well, I guess we're in
a Mexican stand-off my friend.
(WHIMPERING) You shoot me,
I may or may not die, depends if you
can shoot really, doesn't it?
And even if you get me, these two
will still shoot you, take your art.
And even if you get me, these two
will still shoot you, take your art
and damage these fine specimens.
No, I won't.
I'm here to steal,
I'm not damaging anyone.
I will. If he kills you, Vic,
I'll defend your hon our.
The art'll just be a bonus. If you
you wanna still art to make money,
Upstairs in the kitchen, that's the
one. I told you.
Cezanne. 200 fucking million!
No, you didn't, I told you that.
You were going gaga
about the fucking goblet.
Just take it and fuck off. You don't
tell me what to fucking do!
(WHIMPERING) Go and get it.
It's a two-man job.
Then fucking get it, both of you!
They're going to the kitchen.
Right. Righto. Let's go.
Ahh! Don't be a clever Dick, Foley.
These girls'll get the blast
before you do.
(WHIMPERS)
How do you wanna play this, Jake?
Dad, I'm scared! It's OK, baby.
It's gonna be OK.
What's going on? Who is this guy?
Where is everyone else?
We are old friends.
Aren't we, Jake?
He's Paul's brother.
The others are sick. Sick?
Sick from what? Poison. Poison?!
Jake, what's going on?!
Have you ever tried to sell
high-end stolen art, Victor?
Whatever that kid's telling you
art collectors,
they like to show off.
Who you gonna sell it to?
I'm connected,
I can fence anything.
Are you feeling OK?
You don't look so good.
Did you touch that glass?
Yeah, yeah, I touched the glass.
So... so what?
Well,
you might have a problem with that.
That's where the poison was...
on the glass.
Bullshit, Foley. Why would there be
poisoned on the glass?
I'll let you ask my soon-to-be
ex-wife Nicole here.
She's been having an affair.
I decided to poison her lover.
What have you done?
I don't believe ya. Ask her.
Nicole, have you or have you not
been fucking one of my friends?
Where's Alex?
Where's Alex?! You can feel the
poison taking hold now, can't you?
Right there... I've got a safe,
In it is a bunch of cash and what
you'll need to stop the poison.
I need it too.
OK...
I'm gonna go and open the safe.
(WHIRRING)
One jumps, we all jump.
(WHIMPERS)
Oh, boy!
Go, go, go!
What's this? Watch out!
(GUNSHOT) (GROANS)
(GROANING)
Get him! Get him! (GROANING)
(GROANING)
Slowly. Slowly.
Got him? (GROANING)
(GROANS)
Got him? (GROANING)
(GROANS)
(HOLLERS)
(GROANS)
(GROANS) (SCREAMS)
You think I'm gonna let you have
this, you dumb motherfucker?
I don't give a shit if you die!
Thanks for the money. I win!
Enjoy your death from poison,
you shit cunt!
(LAUGHS)
Yargh!
(GROANS / LAUGHS)
(HUBBUB)
(GROANING)
(GUN COCKS)
So far up your own arse,
aren't you, Foley?
You always thought you were better
than anyone else!
Well, I'll leave you here
so these women can watch you die!
Dad!

'Life's just the game, right?
A game of karma, luck and physics.
People don't always get to know.
People don't always get to know
when the game will finish.'
Are you ready?
'On reflection,
it's been a gift.'
Let's go. 'I've never been misguided
in understanding.
Let's go. 'I've never been misguided
in understanding
that the way we've created
opportunity for ourselves
Hasn't had an effect
in the lives of others.
That's another one of Newton's laws.
I can't change that.
But I can try to rebalance.
To that extent, half of my estate
has been divided
amongst 21 charities and foundations
in the hope the money finds its way
to those who need it most,
including families affected
by gambling addiction.'
"This is the last will and testament
of John..."
'Drew, I have signed total control
over both companies to you.
There's a's schedule
for future profits
that involves everyone in this room.
Thanks for everything, man.
What a ride that was.
I'll see you again.'
"I'll see you again."
'Paulie,
you have to get out of politics,
it's not a healthy place.
I hope $50 million
will make the transition easier.'
"Nicole and Alex..."
'Nicole and Alex, $50 million.
And a fund set up
for all your children.
You're gonna be great parents.
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.
There's $50 million for you too.
You're doing great,
but you have to finish
your 12 months in rehab first.
There's no way around that.
Mike, you can do anything
you set your mind to.
Rebecca, my beautiful daughter.
I am so sorry about this.
If I could change it, I would.
The remainder of my estate is yours,
it's a lot of money,
already in accounts in your name.
You manage it, you'll be fine.
I love you.'
I love you too, Dad.
'Bec, your delinquent uncles
are in no way perfect,
but you'll find in life
that friendship and love start
when you forgive imperfections.
Listen to them all. They've all got
big life journeys to draw from.
But listen to Drew the most.
Be kind to each other.
Don't be glass half empty
or half full people,
be the kind of people who know
whatever triumph
or disaster comes along
you can always refill the glass.'
