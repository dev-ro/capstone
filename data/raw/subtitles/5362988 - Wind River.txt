YOUNG WOMAN:
There's a meadow
in my perfect world...
where wind dances
the branches of a tree,
casting leopard spots of light
across the face of a pond.
The tree stands tall
and grand and alone,
shading the world beneath it.

of all I hold dear,

in the mud of the real,
far from your loving eyes...
I will return to this place,
close mine,
and take solace in the simple
perfection of knowing you.

Yeah, that's why I'm going.
Don't let Casey

I don't want to move her
until they have a look,
but I'm not gonna try

We gotta get
this show on the road.
We're losing the tracks, Ben.

You should let me follow 'em

He's the one

And this is his, uh,

He don't do nothin'.
We got the same job, eh?
Well, um, I'm sorry to meet
under these circumstances.
(SNIFFS) So, do you want

I don't mean to be rude...
I'm just freezing
my ass off here, so...
the quicker, the-the better.
BEN: Yeah? Well,
that's gonna get a lot worse
if you go out there
dressed like that.
The body's five miles
on snowmobile.
I'm afraid you'd be dead
by the time we got there.
Okay. I-I got the call
when I was at a weapons course
in Riverton, so this is...
this is what I've got.
BEN: Well, you should have
a winter gear bag
- in that truck.
- Well, um, no,
that's not a government

I flew in from Vegas.
So I'm just the closest agent

You don't...
you don't think I can...
I can make it?
- Oh, you're from Vegas?
- No, I'm not... I'm not

I'm stationed there.
I'm from Fort Lauderdale.
I'm sorry, if we're gonna keep

- Yeah. Over here.
JANE:
You got a positive ID?
Not positive, no.
Natalie Hanson.
We'll call that positive
for now.
(SNIFFS)
Does she live close by?
BEN:
Yeah. Fort Wakashie.
It's to the north a ways.
What's "a ways"?
About a 30-minute drive.
Okay, well,
she didn't run from home, then.
No one reported her missing?
Her parents...?
Nope.
(WIND WHISTLING)
Yeah. That's why we called you.
How experienced is your
medical examiner? (SNIFFS)
Let's just say he...
he stays busy.
Uh, order a rape kit.
When he's done with the prelim,
I want her body sent
to Loveland.
And make sure
her belongings go with her,
'cause they need
to get tested, too.
I'm listing this as a homicide.
How well do you know this land?
Like it's my job.
'Cause it is.
Well, is there anywhere
she could be running from?
Is there anything close by?
Nearest house is three
and a half miles from here.
- Southeast.
- Sam Littlefeather's place
is over there.
Yep.
Those boys could use
some serious looking into.
There are no structures closer?
There's a drill rig
five miles from here.
They got trailers
for the workers, but...
- that's closed for the winter.
- JANE: Okay, so why would
a teenage girl be out here?
Well, kids come out here
on their snow machines,
and, uh, have a big party
in the snow.
Not barefoot, they don't.
What do you think?
I only know
what the tracks say.
Okay, well, that's all we got.
Well, come here, I'll show you.
Over here. See this one?
See how the toes turned out,
the front is much deeper
than the back?
That says she was running.
Come here. I'll show you.
She ran until she dropped here.
See the pool of blood
where her face hit the snow.
Now, it gets 20 below
here at night,
so if you fill your lungs up
with that cold air
when you're running,
you could freeze 'em up.
Your lungs fill up with blood,
you start coughing it up.
So wherever she came from...
...she ran all the way here.
Her lungs burst here.
And she curled up
in that tree line
and drowned in her own blood.
Well, how far do you think
someone could run barefoot
out here?
Oh, I don't know, I...
How do you gauge
someone's will to live?
Especially in these conditions.
But I knew that girl.
She's a fighter.
So no matter
how far you think she ran,
I can guarantee you
she ran further.
(WIND WHISTLING)
I got to get back to my son.
(WIND WHISTLING)
Hey, um... would you
be willing to help me?
(INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO

and I didn't.
Sorry, what is it...
what is it that you do again?

(BEN CHUCKLES)

See you found town okay.

Did the family
identify the body?
- Yeah.
- (JANE SIGHS)
Did they give you a reason
for not reporting her missing?
Well, she stayed
with a boyfriend some.
They didn't think anything
of it.
She was 18,
free to do what she wanted.
Okay, Randy,
you're on the clock.
I got about five minutes
of this in me, so let's go.
RANDY:
I'll be quick. Morning.
Randy Whitehurst.
I'm the medical examiner.
I'm-I'm Jane Banner, FBI.
Uh, as you can see here,
she suffered a deep laceration
along her brow line.
Two separated ribs.
Frostbite in both feet
up through her ankles,
frostbite on her nose
and on her left hand.
Uh, the frostbite
on her feet is stage four.
You can tell
by the bluing here.
You see that?
Yeah.
Uh, vaginal wall is torn
in different depths.
You think there are
multiple assailants?
Can't determine that.
Could be one assailant who
assaulted her multiple times.
Uh, I swabbed her
and sent the sample by courier
to the FBI crime lab
in Loveland, Colorado
per your request.
We should have the DNA results
in six weeks.
Uh, those findings might help
us make that determination.
What are you listing
as the cause of death?
Well, you're not gonna like it.
She died
from a pulmonary hemorrhage.
When... subzero air
is drawn into the lungs,
it can cause the alveoli...
the tiny sacs in the lungs...
to burst.
Fluid builds in the lungs,
and if the air is cold enough,
the liquid in the lungs
will crystallize.
Ultimately,
the victim either...
Sorry, you're not listing this
as a homicide?
Can't.
Uh, s...
You have to take
into consideration
the circumstances.
She was raped repeatedly,
beaten...
Look, uh, circumstances
is your field, not mine.
- Now, let me... let me show you.
- No.
I don't need it explained.
This is very prosecutable
as a murder.
I mean, clearly,
she wouldn't have been
running through the snow
if she hadn't been attacked,
but I can't list the cause
of death as homicide.
And I can't get an FBI team
to the reservation
unless it's listed
as a homicide.
Look, I'm not here
to solve this.
I'm-I'm just here
to obtain a cause of death
- and send a team here that can.
- RANDY: Look, present
the rape, present the assault,
and I'm...
Those don't fall
to the jurisdiction of the FBI.
They fall to the Bureau
of Indian Affairs.
Huh. Hey, don't look at me.
I'm used to no help.
You have six officers
on your entire force
to cover an area the size
of Rhode Island.
BEN:
Yes, I know that.
No offense,
but this will have to curl up
in your lap
in order for you to solve it.
- (SCOFFS) I know that, too.
- RANDY: We all know
it's a murder.
All right, have a U.S. Attorney
sign off on it,
I'm happy to corroborate that,
but I just can't put it
on the death certificate.

Ah. Um, look...

I am just trying to understand

I'm trying to help.
Why is it whenever
you people try to help,
it starts with insults?
I don't know why
she didn't tell me,
but she was 18,
and I chose to trust her.
I chose wrong.
Okay, well, um,

Did you know that?
I don't know why.
Just wanted the bad

Wanted answers... to questions

The counselor come up to me
after the seminar
and sat down next to me.
And he said something
that stuck with me.
I don't know
if it's what he said,
or it's how he said it.
He says, "I got some good news,
and I got some bad news."
"Bad news is you're never
gonna be the same.
"You're never gonna be whole,
not ever again.
"Your lost your daughter.
"Nothing's ever going
to replace that.
"Now the good news is,
"as soon as you accept that,
and you let yourself suffer...
"...you allow yourself
to visit her in your mind,
"and you'll remember
all the love she gave,
all the joy she knew."
Point is, Martin,
you can't steer from the pain.
If you do,
you'll rob yourself...
You'll rob yourself
of every memory of her.
Every last one.
From her first step
to her last smile.
Kill 'em all.
Just take the pain, Martin.
You hear me?
You take it.
It's the only way
you'll keep her with you.
I'm just tired, Cory.
You know, I just...
I'm so tired

Hmph.
Drugs is his family now.
He's gone, too.
Lives right down the damn road,

What... what cracker?
Was she seeing a white guy?
Do you know him?
Do you know who he is?
BEN:
Do you know his name, Chip?
You just said "was."
Why did you say "was"?
Wh-Why did she say "was"?
She just said "was"!
Because I found her
raped and killed
right over there, son.
That's why.
No.
(SNIFFLES)
(SOBBING)
What?!
(CONTINUES SOBBING)
(ECHOING SHOUT):
What...?!
(WIND WHISTLING)
You go. I'm gonna get Chip
over to Lander
and see if he'll give me
the name of this boyfriend.
I'm telling you,
this is how we find him.
(CHUCKLES): No, we go to where
he works or where he lives.
Yeah?
All right, well,
where does he work?
Where does he live?
You think this asshole's gonna
tell us anything? I don't.
Look, I know
you're looking for clues,
but you're missing
all the signs.
Come here. Let me show you.
See this here?
- This is a sled track, right?
- Okay.
Okay, you see out here
on the ridge?
Here.
Use these.
- Okay.
- You see at the end of the ridge here?
Follow my hand.
Can you see my hand?
- Yep.
- Okay, when I take it away, now look.
- Do you see that?
- Uh-huh.
- Can you see the shadow there?
- I think so.
The snow's starting
to cover it.
Now look up at the base
of the mountain there...
you see it go
up the ridge there?
You'll see it
a lot easier there.
You see those tracks go
up that mountain there?
- Yeah, I see it.
- All right.
Natalie's body was found
just past there. Right?
And someone unloaded a sled
right here,
drove all the way out there.
There's no tracks coming back...
why is that?
I'm telling you...
the answers are out there.
(SNIFFLES)
Hey, look, um...
I don't know how
to do this, okay?
- I'm not a tracker.
- That's okay.
That's all I do.
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
Look...
- you asked me to help you, right?
- Yeah.
We should go,
while I still can.
Okay.
(TURNS OFF ENGINE)
Why are we stopping?
Well, we're
above the storm now.
The trees are
too thick to drive.
Got to walk from here.
Come on.
(CLEARS THROAT)
- Put these on.
- Okay.
Now what?
We walk.
Follow these sled tracks
heading south.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
- All right, follow me.
- Mm. Okay.
♫
(SQUAWKS)
Oh, my God.
(SQUAWKING)
(HAWK SHRIEKS)
Oh, my God.
We were on foot
the last half mile of it,
but we blazed a pretty good
trail in the snow, so...
I could take the boys
back up there if you want.
BEN: Well, I'll talk
to the BIA supervisor.
He just might want you
to do that.
Security team
over at the rig's got cameras
around the perimeter.
I'm gonna head up there
in the morning...
we might get lucky
and find something on tape.
All right.
Did... did the two we have
in custody say anything?
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) They ain't
the talking kind, Jane.
These kids,
they expect to go to prison.
It's a rite of passage.
Hell, I think they look forward
to it... you know, uh,
three hots and a cot
and free cable.
Anything's better than being
here, the way they see it.
Let's just test their DNA
against the semen
and see what that tells us.
- Can I talk to them?
- JANE: No, Cory.
Anything they tell you
would be inadmissible in court.
And then anything you'd tell us
would render every net result
inadmissible as well.
What if I didn't tell you?
What if I just knew it?
(PHONE RINGING)
(SIGHS)
(CLEARS THROAT)
Yeah. Agent Banner.
Yes, sir. (COUGHS)
CORY:
Ben.
I've known this kid
since he could walk.
I gotta canvass the house.
The, uh, back door only locks
from the inside.
(ENGINE IDLING QUIETLY)
- Look at you.
- (LAUGHS)
(SCOFFS)
Look at you.
I didn't do shit.
- (CORY CHUCKLES)
- (CLEARS THROAT)
All you've been doing is shit
for the last few years, Chip.
(LAUGHS WRYLY)
It's this place, man.
Look what it takes from us.
What it took from you.
I'm not gonna stand here
and tell you that life's fair,
'cause it ain't.
To either of us.
But, you know,
- what do we do?
- (COUGHING QUIETLY)
This land, land,
- this land is all we got left.
- What's this "we" shit?
Only thing native about you
is your ex-wife,
and the daughter
you couldn't protect.
Maybe if you'd
played detective...
(COUGHING)
That's not something
you get to talk about.
- (CONTINUES COUGHING)
- You hear me?
Go over there.
(SNIFFS)
You're gonna lecture me
about protecting people
while you deal the shit
that's killing them?
Unlike most people,
you had every chance
to get the hell out of here
if that's what you want.
You had the army,
you had college...
whatever, it was your choice.
Look what you chose.
Look what you chose.
Goddamn you.
I met him.
Yeah?
Yeah, the motherfucker
was almost as old as you.
All right?
I wanted to fight his ass, too.
But Natalie wouldn't let me.
(WRY CHUCKLE) Guess love
really is blind, huh?
He works security
on one of them drill sites.
Does the boyfriend have a name?
Matt. Matt something.
I don't know.
Who does?
Sam knew.
Why don't you ask him?
I think you'll be talking
to Sam long before I do.
You think this is
who I wanted to be?
Man...
I get so mad,
I want to fight
the whole world.
You got any idea
what that feels like?
I do.
But I decided to fight
the feeling instead.
'Cause I figured
the world would win.
JANE:
What did I tell you?
Did-did he say anything?
No, fuck, I don't... I don't...
I don't want to know.
- You're headed up to the rigs tomorrow, ain'tcha?
- Yeah.
Natalie's boyfriend
worked there.
What?
No. Fuck, don't tell me.
- This thing's solving itself.
- (JANE GROANS)
Cory.
I want you at the rig
with us tomorrow.
You don't catch wolves
looking where they might be,
you look where they've been.
They been right here.
♫
Hey.
You okay?
I been better.
Brings it all back, doesn't it?
Maybe.
So, you and Ben
and this little FBI girl
formed your own posse
to go solve it all, I hear.
Just trying to help.
You won't get the answers
you're looking for.
No matter what you find.
This isn't about Emily.
(SOFT, TREMBLING BREATH)
Good night, Cory.
♫
JANE:
Matt Rayburn.
Do you know him?
That the guy we found
in the snow?
Yeah. His fingerprints
are in the database.
He's a security contractor
for one of the drill stations.
All right.
That it?
- Am I fired now?
- (LAUGHS): No.
- Come on, why don't you come inside.
- Okay.
- We'll warm up.
- Yeah.
You, uh,
want something to drink?
Sure.
Got, uh... milk
and coffee and well water.
Water is good.
Okay.
All right, uh,
just make yourself at home.
(REFRIGERATOR DOOR OPENS)
(REFRIGERATOR DOOR SHUTS)
(CHUCKLES)
(WATER POURING IN DISTANCE)
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Here you go.
Thanks.
That's, uh...
that's my daughter, Emily.
She passed three years ago.
I'm sorry.
You want to know how,
don't you?
I do, but...
Makes two of us.
I was, uh, working as, uh,
an outfitter in Pinedale,
and there was a big snow.
So I found myself
with a rare night off.
So I go to a motel,
call the wife
and say, "Why don't you come up
and stay for the night?"
And when you got two...
two kids
and you're on the mountain
half the year, it's...
you don't get much time
together.
So we had Emily
look after Casey.
He was five at the time.
She was 16.
I guess word got out
that we were out of town.
So some school friends
came over.
Then some more friends.
Then, uh...
and then some people came over
that weren't friends.
So a little gathering turned
into quite the party, I guess.
Then, uh...
I don't know.
You know,
there's a lot I don't know.
Got that phone call
the next morning.
(CLEARS THROAT)
From Natalie.
Saying that Emily was missing.
She was worried, naturally.
They were best friends.
You know, we tried to be
very careful with Emily.
Tried to plan for everything.
She was such a good girl.
But we let our guard down.
Really, I tell you,
you know,
you may have kids one day.
You cannot blink.
Not once, not ever.
(SNIFFLES)
There was a guy moving sheep
over by the Wind River.
He's the one who found her.
Some 20 miles from our house.
They don't know how she got
there or what happened.
Autopsy couldn't tell us much,
'cause the coyotes got at her
pretty good.
You know, I'm-I'm sor...
I'm sorry, it's not...
I'm sorry.
(SHUDDERING BREATH)
Could you point me, um...
towards your...
uh, the bathroom?
Straight back there.
Thanks.

(GRUNTS, EXHALES)

(SHUDDERING BREATHS)
JANE: "There is a meadow
in my perfect world..."
CORY:
Emily wrote that.
It's what got her accepted
into the summer writing program
at Colorado State.
Did she write it to you?
Mm.
Doesn't matter who it's to.
Just matters who it's from.
Look, I'm sorry about, um,
earlier tonight.
I guess...
I'm just trying to do
the right thing here.
And I don't really know what
the Hanson boy told you, but...
I don't want to stumble
into something like today
if I can help it.
So, you know,
if he said something that...
I should know,
I'd appreciate if you shared.
Well, all he said was that.
Natalie's boyfriend
was named Matt.
And you've already figured out
who that is, so...
You could've called
for that information, no?
I wanted to know
why you're helping me.
Now I do, so...
Tomorrow...
do you think we could not ride
the snowmobiles
80 miles an hour?
Yeah, sure.
If you want to end up in a
ditch we could've jumped over,
- but...
- (CHUCKLES)
Great. (CHUCKLES)
Okay.
You win.
Have a good night.
All right.
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.
(DOOR OPENS)
(ENGINE SHUTS OFF)
You're shaking more
than she is.
It's cold enough to freeze
a well digger's ass out here.
- Yeah. Below zero, I bet.
- Yeah, six below.
It's a lot colder up there.
Hey, bud.
Hey. How are you doing?
What are you doing here?
Those tracks that lead
from the Littlefeather house
to the body, I'm gonna follow
'em, see where they go.
- How about you?
- BEN: Yeah, well,
Jane's the only one
with jurisdiction out there.
Just wanted
a few extra badges along.
You want to walk 'em
through this?
Uh, sure, yeah. Um...
the drill station has cameras
all along its perimeter,
so we're hoping one of
the cameras caught something.
And, uh, we'll also canvass
Matt Rayburn's trailer,
and see if there's anything
that links him to the assault.
Do you have a warrant?
I'm gonna ask real nice.
Can't get there
from the Littlefeather house?
Uh, it's a real tough sled ride
through two canyons,
and I ain't looking
to dig you out,
- so I wouldn't recommend it.
- BEN: We'll take
the refinery road around.
See, you got to drive 50 miles
to go five.
- JANE: Yeah.
- Welcome to Wyoming.
Didn't you people get the memo
that it's-it's spring?
(CHUCKLING)
- Come on, guys.
- If you find anything,
you call me on the radio...
- Sure will.
- ...we'll come up to you.

No, he got in a fight with his

She took off.
He took off after.
We haven't seen him since.
- When was that?

Hell, we-we didn't know

We've been waiting on corporate
ever since to tell us

I thought you guys found her
in a snowdrift
right before the storm.
Excuse me?
I heard her name
go out over the radio

using her name.

Iraq's warm.
Mm.
And I'll tell you what.
I got one.
- Mm-hmm.
- I got one.
I was, uh...
I remember I was stationed
- up at this place called Point Mugu, right?
- Mm-hmm.
It's about an hour north
of L.A. It was Christmas.
I woke up, I'm all alone.
You know, I don't have anybody,
and what the Navy does
at Christmastime
is they have these dumb
little skits in the mess hall,
you know, for the guys
without families.
And I wasn't gonna stick around
for that bullshit,
so I just... I got in my truck,
and I hightailed it
out of there,
and I wound up in this little
mountain town called Ojai.
And I get there,
and it's like...
it's, like, fruit farms
and vineyards,
and there's this mountain
surrounding it, you know,
like, protecting the town.
And the people there are,
like...
- Everybody smiles at each other, you know?
- Yeah?
And they say hello,
and it's, like...
I remember thinking
that they were all, like...
I don't know. They had
these looks in their eyes.
Like they were in
on some sort of a secret,
like they had all
figured it out.
There's this mission,
this Spanish mission
right there
in the middle of town.
They're having Christmas Mass.
They're celebrating Christmas
in 70-degree weather,
you know, and I just went,
and I picked me up an orange
off a tree,
and sat down on a bench
and listened
to that choir sing,
eating my orange, you know.
It was... I don't know.
It was the best Christmas
I ever had.
I want to live there.

No.
It's Gannett Peak.

Highest mountain in Wyoming.
And on the hottest day
in August,
shovel a foot of snow.
Today...
too cold to snow.
(GROANS)
Look, man, let's just...
let's just talk
for a minute, all right?
Let's just... talk. Please.
Sure.
(PETE SIGHS, PANTS)
(GROANING, WHIMPERING)
What the fuck?!
Where are my boots?!
- Where are my boots?!
- You know, I got all
the time in the world here.
- Can't say the same for you.
- (WHIMPERING)
So we gonna talk,
or you gonna keep whining?
(PANTING)
Look, I'm...
I have made mistakes, okay?
So what'd you do?
(PANTING)
Um...
Hey, look, I'm...
I'm not the law here.
I'm just a guy
sitting in front of you.
So you can tell me the truth.
If you tell me the truth,
I'll give you a chance.
Ah, you just listen to me!
You know what it's like
out here in this frozen hell?
There's no nothing to do.
No nothing.
Ain't no women, no fun!
Just this fucking...
this fucking snow
and the fucking silence.
That's all!
My family's people
were forced here,
stuck here for a century.
That snow and silence...
it's the only thing that hasn't
been taken from them.
- So what'd you take?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know what you...
I don't know what you mean.
You take something, too?
(CRYING):
No.
- Nothing.
- Ah.
Hey.
I need you
to be honest with me.
- (CRYING)
- Right?
You get drunk?
Get lonely?
Then what'd you get?
If you did it,
just be a man and say it.
Say, "I raped her."
I raped her.
I raped her! Yeah!
(PETE CRYING)
And the boyfriend?
What, did he get in your way?
Did you beat him to death?
Look, a nod's
not gonna cut it, okay?
- Need you to say it.
- We beat him.
We made him dead.
Okay.
(CORY SIGHS)
Please don't.
(PANTING)
I'm gonna cut you loose.
(PANTING, WHIMPERING)
It's okay.
(CORY GRUNTS)
Free to go.
Where?! Where am I gonna go?!
I'm a man of my word.
You told the truth.
I'm gonna give you a chance.
I'm gonna give you
the same chance
that she got.
What...
what chance did she get?
What... what chance
did she get?
If you can make it
to that highway,
you're a free man.
Where-Where's...
where-where is the highway?
You know how far
that drill camp was
from where
I found Natalie's body?
No.
Six miles. Barefoot.
(SIGHS)
That's a warrior.
That's a warrior.
You? You may make 600 feet,
but...
- Uh...
- ...you better get going.
But... (GROANS)
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
What do you want me to do?!
I want you to run.

(WEAKLY):
Please don't make me laugh.
It's an alligator.
He'll protect you, better than

(CHUCKLES)
I shouldn't joke about that...
it saved your life.
You saved my life.
Well...
Jane, you're a tough woman.
You saved your own life.
We should both be honest.
I just...
(EXHALES)
I got lucky.
Well, you know,
luck don't live out here.
Luck lives in the city.
Don't live out here.
You know,
that's whether you get,
you know, hit by a bus or not.
Whether your...
bank is robbed or not,
or whether someone's...
on their damn cell phone
when they come up
to a crosswalk... that's luck.
That's winning or losing.
Out here, you survive
or you surrender. Period.
That's determined by your
strength and by your spirit.
Wolves don't kill unlucky deer.
They kill the weak ones.
You fought for your life, Jane.
Now you get to walk away
with it.
You get to go home.
(CORY CHUCKLES)
I know what you're doing.
I'm gonna read to you
from a magazine.
(CORY SNIFFS)
"Ten Signs That He's Into You."
Things that
I really want to know.
"He looks you in the eye

- What's with the paint?
- (EXHALES)
It's my death face.
Is that right?
And how would you know
what that is?
I don't.
Just made it up.
'Cause there's no one left
to teach me.
I was ready to quit.
Then the phone rang.
Which is never good.
But today it was.
First time Chip's called me
in over a year.
Where is he?
The station.
I was gonna go pick him up.
(LAUGHS): as soon as I washed
this shit off my face.
(SNIFFS)
Heard about what happened.
Heard there's one
still missing.
No.
No one's missing.
How'd he go out?
With a whimper.
You better go easy on Chip.
Suffering's hard on young men;
they don't have our practice.
I should go get him.
Yeah, but I...
just need to sit here...
...and miss her for a minute.
You got time to sit with me?
Oh, I ain't goin' nowhere.

♫ I've been traveling
♫ Flying on south again
♫ How
♫ How could it be
♫ It seems as though
♫ A moment ago
♫ I was reaping the seeds
♫ That I sow
♫ Now, morning
blows quickly through ♫
♫ Afternoon follows suit
♫ How am I
to get these things done? ♫
♫ Well, time stays
♫ When counted by days
♫ A looming and ominous shade
♫ Worry been breaking
♫ And bringing me down
♫ And counting
all the times that I fall ♫
♫ But when my time comes
♫ I won't be counting at all
♫ I feel all my filth
♫ When I look in your eyes
♫ But it falls
♫ Light as a feather
♫ On my back in the night
♫ Man, you said meet me there
♫ How do I get from here
♫ To where
♫ Where I belong?
♫ It ain't just like finding
♫ A sign to get home
♫ It's building your house
on the stone ♫
♫ Worry been breaking
♫ And bringing me down
♫ And counting
all the times that I fall ♫
♫ But when my time comes
♫ I won't be counting at all
♫ I feel all my filth
♫ When I look in your eyes
♫ But it falls
♫ Light as a feather
♫ On my back in the night
♫ Your house,
it will cover you ♫
♫ But the rain
still falls outside ♫
♫ Your light, it don't shine
♫ 'Cause it's hidden
♫ Under a bed
♫ Why
♫ Do you hide
♫ Under a bed?
