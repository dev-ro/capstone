BLIND CHANCE
Scenario and direction
Write
Seventeen minus nine equals eight
That's how your mother wrote eight
I'm only going to Denmark.
I'll write to you, Witek
I suggest we go through the names
- Kubin
- No problems with him
- Who was he?
- The "Prime Minister"
Still, he kissed a woman in the
cloakroom. He can be transferred
This one was "Minister of Health"
Still, his marks are good, he has
leadership qualities, but he's popular
Screw her!
What's wrong?
She was my primary school teacher.
I detested her
But you've noticed me at last
I bought you presents, but I didn't
like your school reports
You knew, didn't you?
You know what pleased me most?
When you beat up that teacher
You had bad marks ever after.
I never did like star pupils
Especially in real life
Will you stay the night?
My son, Witek
- I've only got the room for an hour
- I must make a call
You call, but never say anything
Father
Thet're taking me to hospital. I want
to sat, tou don't have to...
- What?
- Nothing
My father
Were you pissing or being sick?
Well, all the best
You feel you lack the vocation?
Why?
My father's died. He wanted me
to be a doctor
But finally he said I don't have to...
I'd like time to think it over
Of course
You've a moustache
Beer, please
A student's ticket to Warsaw
You're lucky not to have missed it
It was a near thing
Mind your feet
May I go to the toilet?
All right
But don't get lost
Now, get going!
Take my shoes
He didn't want to escape?
Sometimes people don't want to escape
If they hit this bone hard enough...
...you walk like this for ever
It's getting worse
I sort of confessed at the trial...
...because it was for the Party
As a Party member I had to confess
things I didn't do
I didn't think about it
And Krystyna...
...Ionged for freedom
- You talked about her?
- Yes
She was white all over...
strange for such a woman
And she had that down on
her upper lip...
...and about her ears...
...and fat, ugly hands
Perhaps that's why I touched her,
because of the fault in her
Ugly, fat hands
She could't remove her wedding ring
when Adam...
...when Adam was taken to prison
in 1949
They took him, so he had to be a spy,
though he wasn't...
...and for a year I tried to
explain it to her
Then I moved in with her
Did we try that phone call?
No reply
And today?
I still believe. And she?
When they locked me up...
...she began to doubt if she was
the wife of a spy
But she believed in me
She couldn't credit that I, too,
opposed the Party and communism
She stopped believing the Party
She believed in herself
Him and me were in the same prison
She visited us both
Him and me passed each other
She was even whiter then, even paler
That down on her upper lip...
Ask for Krystyna
I'm calling from a pay-phone.
May I speak to Krystyna?
Say you're from the Institute
It's me, Krystyna. I got back
some hours ago
You weren't in
You haven't been able to sleep?
There's nothing... I've been away
And I'm going again soon,
so I haven't bought anything
No, I can't eat this late
Have I shown you the photograph?
Anyway, you'll probably meet her
some day
A picture from thirty years ago
Don't think of those days...
...in real terms
When did they release you?
Too late. Spies were released in '54
Deviationists were released
slightly later
By the time I was released...
...they'd been together for a year
And you?
Well, I got this apartment
I think I'll end up here
And you believe in all this?
All this and that
Perhaps it's easier for me to believe...
...because here I am
Here I am more equal
After prison...
...I didn't want to be equal
They made offers to me, of course
I left prison with people who were
able to make lots of offers
But you can see what's happening
It's all quite simple
We failed, but you may succeed
Yes, you, for instance
Want a blanket?
Go to bed; I'll stay up for a while
You'll find a blanket there
I have several blankets
My father died ten days ago
I was too late to see him
But he told the doctor to tell me
that I needn't do anything
This is Mr. Dlugosz
The Dean gave him leave;
fourth year of medical studies
You think you lack the vocation?
That says everything
You read it?
It's well written and I agree with it
Whatever you do is done well
We can start now
Would you like to listen?
- Werner is leaving in three weeks
- For long, probably
Let me know if you need anything
I know what I want to say,
I don't need to read it
I'd like to offer you...
...the ideals to which I have been
committed...
...for forty years
Every generation craves for light
It needs reassurance and faith...
...in a better, more just path
An urge which is older and younger
than Marx...
...resembles a narcotic
Early in life it is a joy,
because the light seems so near...
...so reachable
Finally, it brings bitterness
We can see how it has receded
I have been through much these
forty years
I see that the light has receded,
but I should not discourage you
You can be sure of one thing
Without that bitterness, that hope...
...life would be lamentable
Don't be afraid; her eyesight is bad
and she doesn't wear spectacles
Do you recogize me?
May I kiss your hand?
Will you talk to me?
Will you wait?
- Who is it?
- My first love
Remember to turn off the gas
Adam gave me his card and told me to
contact him after you leave
I don't know what to do about it
Do as you wish
Is it an application for a passport?
No, for the Party
It's a pity we didn't go to bed
when we were seventeen
Stanislawski... athlete
Zimmerman... it says here here
that he's a mechanic
Buzek... I'll have to check
There's a problem with the list
of Polish Youth
They're asking who's who
Dear Witek, sit for a moment with us
We have a problem
Trouble at a clinic
Junkies, and so on
Drug addicts
We sent new doctors and nurses,
we kicked out the old staff
Now the patients say they don't want
them and they'll burn the place down
It would be easy to call in the police,
but we have to go there ourselves
Hold on a moment
He could go
How about it?
We can't go, because they hold us
responsible, but you...
Comrade Adam thinks well of him;
Adam says we should have a go
But what should I do there?
Calm them down, at all costs
We'll stay here, awaiting your call
Is the car here?
There's a query about Buzek and others
Well, Buzek is an aeroplane engineer
The place isn't far away,
you'll be there in an hour
He's going
From Warsaw H.Q.
Documents
We've met before. I'm from H.Q.
We can burn the lot in five minutes
- What's the code for Warsaw?
- Dial 8
Just like in America
It's me
The doctors are in the cage
I've just arrived
I'm calling from the manager's office
This is the "education" room
The manager's office is nicer
True, isn't it?
With potted plants
Since they took over, two boys and
a girl have made the trip
She poisened herself,
they hanged themselves
One was in this cage for four days
Before?
- No one killed themselves
- What do you want, then?
Can't you read?
Reinstate the previous staff, medical
administation, not "Youth" control
- You're the manager?
- Yes. This is the therapist
- And the others?
- They escaped in time
- Can I speak to them?
- Yes
- What can I do?
- Think of a way to get us out
Who was here before you?
Old fools who allowed drugs smuggled
in. They were devoted to "persuasion"
But no one hanged themselves?
We saved one. The other deaths were
judged as misadventure
- Will they do as they say?
- Sure, they're all mental cases
We're not afraid
Just like in America
Could you get everyone together?
There was roll-call, then a news
review...
...they read our letters, checked
parcels, deprived us of visits
And they made me a group leader-
do I look like one?
As far as I could tell the old
manager liked us
This one killed Stasek because
he made love to me
Her boy-friend hanged himself
We walk the world in search
of a new life
We never cease awaiting
the arrival of a new love
Telephone call for you
A meeting
They escaped! Bring the cans!
Stop it! You have me!
Bring buckets, we'll spread it around
Pour it everywhere
Can you hear?
I stayed, otherwise they would
burn the place
Anyway, their demands are just
We'll wait until eight
It's only water, we have to
rehearse it
A good starting point for you; it's
good that you showed some weakness
I was scared
I know. But understand that
such a moment can be used
A moment's weakness makes you more like
them, they relax, then you gain control
But it wasn't necessary to let them
hear you say their demands were just
But they were
Yes, but your actions should concern
authority, prestige, concessions
I'd like a fair solution
Yes, but don't express personal
opinions alone in front of them
But I was alone
No, you had a phone, you knew the
authorities would back you up
Mr. Dlugosz
Wasn't it you who phoned a year ago,
before Werner left?
Werner and I were once good friends
He told me quite a lot
About prison?
If he had left earlier, we could
have been in each other's shoes
You think it's chance? They beat him
and he confessed without being guilty
- It's a matter of character
- Mine, too
But later, for fifteen years...
...I exercised my legs
He lacked the motivation
How can a man still believe an ideal
which destroyed much of his life?
Every ideal has a time of instability.
The Inquisition was worse
Believers died at the stake. When
John XXIII came, the church revived
Are you sure the period of mistakes
will not return?
Here? How can we be sure?
We are going through a stage...
...when everything disintegrates
These people are helpless,
these people in power
It's only a matter of time before
the structures crash
You think that, and you
speak about it?
- Aloud? Yes
- But why to me?
Because those at the top don't
want to listen to me
I must find some support. Perhaps you?
What are we going to do?
Scissors
- Where were we?
- What are we going to do?
Be on the inside; nothing can be
improved from the outside
When things disintegrate, someone
has to pick up the pieces
You or I... somebody has to do it
We can't just leave the country;
would you leave it to them?
What frightens me is that one
loses freedom
It's possible to be so dependent
That's the meaning of organization.
They know of every step I take...
...but I accept it
And you know what I said and didn't
say to the addicts
Because you took your first step
Let's start from the beginning
What's it to you?
I must know all about you,
if we are meant to stay together
Don't you see?
The first was a boy at scout camp.
I was wearing very tight knickers
To make things worse, another boy
was beside us...
...pretending to sleep, but panting
all the time
I had to stretch those knickers.
My skin was sore
- Did it hurt?
- My skin?
Yes, it hurt. I've had three abortions
One because of love,
two because of accidents
The first one was in hospital
It was awful. They shaved me.
They don't shave private patients
How many more blokes were there?
Exactly? Six
No, seven. Only once with the seventh,
he hit me, here
I slept with him in a hotel,
the Europejski Hotel
Where were you with the others?
In bed, the bathroom, a car...
once in a toilet
I love you
I love you, too
I wanted so badly to find you
during that year
I went to the hostel several times
I've been here, too.
I was afraid to telephone
What's up?
They bring so much stuff.
Someone may get caught, God forbid
- Well?
- All right so far
He complains about the underground
literature here
"What sort of a country will it be?
"Different, just, noble. Europe's best
sons will give their blood for her"
Do they distribute the books?
No, we take them to other places.
Local lads arrange the distribution
It's fine organization
I'm here with a girl
See what books I have
It's funny you should keep
your boat here
They store illegal stuff
- How many are involved?
- Quite a few
Is your girl involved?
I'm not asking you to give me names
It's good to know what's going on
It's important for us to have our own
information, rather than from others
Take that into consideration.
Think it over
- You'll meet the French in July?
- That's the plan, but I'm not sure
When is Werner back?
Soon, probably
He will sail the seas!
- What are you drinking?
- Vodka. I'm getting drunk
- Are you alive?
- Yes
- What is your sign?
- The White Eagle
- When were you born?
- June, 1956, in Poznan
Me, too, only in Lodz
There were tanks in Poznan at the time.
Father stayed at the factory
When mother knew her time had come,
she went to the hospital alone...
...gave birth to us, and died
My brother and me. I was born first,
that why I am alive
It seems to me that I remember
the moment
I have this picture under my eyelids
Has guts. Started talking in public
I understood a lot thanks to you
Thanks, that was the idea
May I?
- I think you'll be elected
- I don't know
It's very important with whom
one walks apart
It would take ages to explain their
system to you. Just look at this
That way, it's a calculator.
Here it's a clock...
...there's the date, and if you
put it into that mode...
...there's a stopwatch,
to fractions of a second
Now press this button
Each figure has its tone
Now try to set the clock
There are ten programmed tunes
How small, and so clever
You're doing well now, being promoted
Yes, I'm a member of the Council now
What's this?
As though it died
- I didn't want to meet you at home
- Yes, Werner is back
We'll have to make different
arrangements. I'll phone
They found books in Lodz. Two lads
were arrested, the printshop closed
Your identity card, please
You?
Come with me
Comrade Adam is engaged now
Have you calmed down?
Should we call the police?
No, throw the little shit out
And keep quiet about it
I'm moving out. You persuaded me it's
possible to believe in something
I believed you, like a fool
When my aunt in Lodz saw my Party card
she broke down and cried
She was so moved, she said her life
wasn't wasted after all
Damn her tears and your cameraderie
It's all for your wielding of power
so you can do as you please
- I've done nothing for years
- That makes it even worse
Sometimes people get arrested.
Even girls
Your friends made an informer
out of me
That's why I punched his face,
with this hand
- That bloody grass!
- I know, he phoned me
Wait a minute
You forgot your ticket to Paris
Dean
You'll lose your newspaper
I answered every question with:
"I don't know"
- Did they beat you up?
- Of course not
A very dishy interrogator, with blue
eyes. He looked like...
...like him
Come for your reward? You got me out?
Shall I take my knickers off?
I didn't arrange anything
I'm confused
You were supposed to go to France
I don't want to go
Go. When you come back, marry
the daughter of...
I'll spit in your face when you become
a minister. Now I feel sorry for you
Taking the globe with you?
No, I don't know what to do with it
Listen, take this for me, will you?
But be careful, it's crystal
- We've met before
- Yes, with the addicts
I'm grateful to you for getting me
out of that shambles
- What are we waiting for?
- Passports
I have the passports, but there's a
problem: Strikes in Lublin, Lodz...
We must help our people there;
you must go to them
Beer, please
A student's ticket to Warsaw
Stop him! Call the police!
- Name?
- Dlugosz, Witold
- Date and place of birth?
- 27th June, 1956, Poznan
A student?
Yes. On Dean's Leave
He struggled, then he hit the
policeman and a colleague
A week before I caught him
relieving himself at the station
I didn't report that incident
- Is that true?
- No
The Court finds the defendent guilty...
...and sentences him to thirty days
loss of liberty...
...with the obligation to do unpaid,
supervised community work
Kiss my arse
I hope the punishment will serve
an educational purpose
We are studting for four tears.
In twentt tears we will...
- Have you got wine?
- No, we haven't
Wlodek will be Deputt Prlme Minister
Janek will be abroad, with an income
of at least 100,000 dollars
In 1977 we will dig the bottle up
Well, they didn't
It's a pity we don't know
their surnames
What are you here for?
I had a fight with a station guard.
And you?
The Flying University
I allowed lectures in my flat and a
neighbour complained of nuisance
What shall we do with the bottle?
Put it back. Maybe they'll dig it up
from under this eagle
- Is there a Deputy Premier Wlodek?
- I don't know
Wait, there's something on the back
I dug it out in 1975. I thank God
tou didn't make it
I'm Marek
- I'm Witek Dlugosz
- No surnames
- Who told you all this?
- My father
My father died two weeks ago. I didn't
see him before the end
I only spoke to him on the telephone
I asked the doctor if she knew
the meaning of my father's last words
She said he didn't want to die...
...although for some time it seemed
as though he accepted it
Introduce yourselves
He's new and clean
"Robotni"k and another newspaper
I've 4,000 zloties for you, for books
Can you get Burek on literature...
...and Kowalik's "The Social Ststem?"
They are for the free trade unions
The telephone number is there
Couldn't he deliver?
To start with, telephone and
make an appointment
- Should I mention the Father?
- Call me by name
That will be difficult
A month ago I missed a train here;
if I hadn't, I wouldn't be here now
- It's not only a matter of chance
- Sometimes I think it is
Did you forget something?
No, it's me, I telephoned yesterday
What's happened?
- From Stefan?
- Yes, the priest. What's happened?
Nothing
I have money for you. Seven thousand
I saw them, the bastards
It's not altogether their fault,
and it's not that bad. I'll tidy up
No need to be ashamed.
Everyone is scared
I'll help you
This fell on the floor
How did it happen?
They came in, with flowers
On behalf of the workers, they said
Gratitude for my taking care of them...
...when they're sacked or harrassed...
...and in thanks for the leaflets...
it was rather nice
I was about to make coffee for them
Then the tallest one turned over
the table
In five minutes, everything
Weren't you scared?
I live on borrowed time
It's twelve years since I was given
three years to live after surgery
If God presented me with my life,
I've nothing to fear
I panicked for a moment
But there is nothing I should
be afraid of
There's nobody to worry about me
Same here. My parents died,
so did my husband
There's nobody to worry about,
is there?
Do you really believe that
God made you stay alive?
Who else?
Don't worry, He may come to you, too,
if you do what He expects of you
He may come if you help others
But you could ask Him yourself,
He will understand
Do you know what Mother Theresa
used to say...
...when asked what one can give
a dying person?
Faith, that we are not totally alone
I was alone a moment ago,
but you came
That's good
Looking for someone?
Someone is following you
Impossible
What are you doing?
We cast seeds into the wind,
not knowing where thet mat fall
Not knowing who will reap the harvest,
who will sing at the harvest festival
We must sow our poor soil,
though we lack ploughs and harrows
Even if the wind devours the seeds,
even if crows attack the sowers
Daniel? Don't you recognize me?
You went away to Denmark
My sister Wera
- Are you back for good?
- Only a few days. Mother died
I'll see who it is
Shall we stay?
This is my place
If you do this again I'll
inform the authorities
Auntie wants to call the police
A pre-war communist; her husband
was an old fighter
When we moved from Poznan...
...all the locks were changed here
and everything made more secure
- Will she call them?
- No, she's a good sort
She thinks I've done it to annoy her,
so she's upset
- What are you smoking?
- "Sport". First thing I bought here
Mother divorced father;
she lived alone
No one knew she'd died, until bottles
of milk accumulated outside her door
And what about your father?
He builds roads in Denmark.
We have a house and everything
He seems to have got used to it, but
I always feel that I'm far away
It's Danish: "I am happy in this
small, happy country"
Why didn't you go with them?
- I didn't want to
- She fell in love
- Is that true?
- Yes
In 19"6"8 someone shouted at her:
"Jews to Israel!"
A boy slapped his face, and she
fell in love with that boy
He was expelled from university,
then she married him
He's an aeroplane engineer now
At that time I didn't know
the reason for your departure
- How old were you?
- Eighteen
- How old were we?
- Twelve
I remember exactly how
we said good-bye
You and your father were going uphill,
towards a car. He called you
There was no car
- Will you come to Lodz?
- Yes, soon
Look out for me
- But why have you come here?
- I want to be baptised
I'd like to be baptised
Are you crazy? What for?
To have a purpose in life
Many derive peace and security from it
True, but one needs faith for that
I must have it, since I know I want
to speak up, not to be passive
- Join the Party
- They don't know
- Do you pray?
- No
Give it a try one day
Lord
It is done now. Baptism is a
formality, but I am here
I did what I could
Now I beg You:
Be. I am ready. I ask You to be
I will never ask anything of You again
Just be
One thousand. Time for eggs
- How many for you?
- Two
- I'm cooking eggs. How many for you?
- Three... no, two
- How goes it?
- We've printed two thousand
The son of my Dean, medical school
I've something for you to read
- Did you bring something to eat?
- Yes, twenty eggs
The Polish Treaty of Independence
Your passport. Have you a visa?
Yes, and a ticket reservation
What is the purpose of your trip?
Catholic Youth Association world
gathering, near Paris
Well, here's your passport,
but it's not so simple
You were involved with illegal
literature. You were arrested
- You had meetings in your apartment
- Someone else's apartment
Irrelevant. We don't want you
to inform on your friends
We know it all, anyway
In France you will make new contacts
We would like to know what
is going on
We'll give you a phone number;
dial and give the names
We can even make a deal that it will
concern the French only
And what if I agree?
Then you will get your passport
You could have been run over
Did you see me pull her back?
I didn't notice
Strange dat
Never had such a day before
I went to mother's grave
I have a grave now, you know
Everyone has graves to visit
I hadn't, until now.
I came from nowhere
You can't understand that, can you?
You're making this up
No
You had a grandfather, a grandmother.
Everyone has
You must have predecessors
I know nothing about them;
mother never told me
I don't know who they were...
...where they are, nothing
One of my grandfathers was in
the 18"6"3 Uprising
The other took part in Pilsudski's
"Miracle on the Vistula"
Father was in Poznan with General
Kutrzeba, and in the 1956 events
He died in bed three years ago
They're all within reach
I never thought of that
What did your father say to you
when he was dying?
How do you know about that?
He wanted to tell me something...
...but he waited too long with it
I telephoned often, to enquire after
him; it took him some months to die
I kept putting the phone down;
I couldn't keep asking how he was
He knew it was me who kept phoning
Good tea
In our fourth year, at a post mortem,
one student had a strange expression
They were opening up her old teacher
Later she told me she tried to imagine
she was opening her
Why am I telling you all this?
Because I was telling you about
the film"Manhattan"
We talk so much; we've told each
other everything, I expect
No, many things are difficult
to tell others
Have you such things?
- You wouldn't tell me?
- Not even you
Fear? What else?
Things about my father, about God
About my crooked toe
And something I don't know
how to tell you
- But you'd like to
- I don't know how
It could be a bit about both of us
Are you sleepy?
Get up, I'll show you something
That's what you wanted to show me?
There is... there was a note inside
About the past and the future...
it's gone now
You were going to France
I didn't get the passport. It would
have been my first flight abroad
My husband maintains those planes
You told me
Didn't you want to go to bed with me?
I did
Do you believe in God?
Really?
- Were you baptised?
- Recently
How is it?
The priest asks if you're ready to
accept the Catholic faith
- And what do you answer?
- Yes
They found out?
Where were you?
What about the boys?
In prison
You were supposed to be here, too.
Where were you?
You suspect me?
Give me the keys
And never show up again
Don't you understand?
Everything will clear up
- What about me?
- Pray
Pray not to hate those who accuse you
Always remember that this is
a conspiracy
It is difficult to dispel a suspicion
You will come to France with us
We'll have plenty of time there
- You'll calm down
- I won't come with you
- To the Praga district?
- From over there
Is Wera in? Do you know when
she will be back?
I'm her brother's friend
She's gone to Lodz
You were out. I waited four hours.
Wera
Did you hear?
Was the girl who stayed with you
a few days Jewish?
There were many wonderful communists
- What are you listening to?
- Radio Free Europe
Workers in mant Polish cities and at
the Ursus factory in Warsaw struck
I'm glad you haven't gone abroad now
A student's ticket to Warsaw
How come you're here?
I phoned; your aunt said
you're leaving
- I wanted to accompany you
- I was five seconds late
I looked for you after the funeral
Remember the first time, on the floor?
Leave them in the office,
I'm too busy now
To see me?
Yes, but I don't know where to start
You gave me leave
I remember. Was it a mistake?
No, I'd like to return and make up
for the lost time
You said you'd lost the vocation
It returned
It doesn't look like it, although...
I've something to tell you
I'm three months pregnant
You really want to marry me?
Aware of the rights and duties...
...of establishing a family...
...I solemnly declare...
...that I contract marriage...
...with Olga Matwijszyn
I'd like to talk to you.
We have a proposal
We'd like you to stay at the Academy
I really wanted to work in a hospital
You can. But you can spend some hours
with us, preparing your Ph.D.
I've a lucky streak lately
Does that bother you?
A prescription
Couldn't she be taken to hospital?
I'll bring the medicine myself
I'll visit often; don't send her to
a nursing home
It will only be a month or two now
They've been practising for ten years
What for?
They say no one else in the world
can keep so many going at once
Who talked to you?
The First Secretary and another one
They said they'll give me a position...
...which will enable me to work
better on my Ph.D.
I want to refuse them,
but I don't know how
- Do you believe in God?
- No
But you could say that you do and
you won't make compromises about it
They couldn't check on that
I used to put them off by saying that
I did not believe in the Party
But I don't advise you to do that;
they got angry
You won't go along with them?
You've a moustache
I've heard that they made you an
offer and you refused
Shall I sing you "The International"
in the evenings?
We've maintained the treatment
for a week
Any improvement?
Here's the last ECG
The heart is more stable
Can I talk to you for a moment?
We're collecting signatures
of scientific workers
Students are persecuted for advertising
the Flying University
Who is he?
They want to expel him from
the university for printing leaflets
Not everyone wants to sign it
You've stood out in the past
Yes, but I won't sign it, either
Isn't it the Dean's son?
What's the trouble?
At the station? I'll come at once
Thanks for coming here so late
It's a private matter
You know my son was arrested
I'm going to Warsaw,
but that's not the issue
I was supposed to go to Lybia
in a month's time
Impossible now
Some time ago I didn't sign a
petition protesting against his arrest
At the time I thought you were right
I'm not so sure now
I just didn't want to take sides
You're a decent sort and it's all
of no importance
I'd like you to replace me in Lybia
It's just a conference, you can
read my lectures for me
- You needn't decide now
- Of course I'll go
Hear me out before you agree
I've no one to turn to now;
I doubt if anyone would help me
I expect they'll expel me from
the Academy
They should let you out of the country,
but it may be your last trip for years
I'd like you to think it over
If you decide to go, let me know
If not, we haven't seen each other
I'll go
It's for the 10th July, but
my wife's birthday is on the 9th...
...and I'd like to go a day or two
later
I love my wife very much
There's a connection on the 11th,
via Paris
I'll check whether the ticket is
valid for foreign airlines
A beautiful lighter
Yes, the ticket was bought with
foreign currency
Leave it with me, I'll make
the reservations
- When shall I call back?
- In two or three days
Are we clearing up?
Go to bed. I'll just empty
the ashtrays
Will you come to Warsaw with me,
to the airport?
No, I'm on duty that day
- Don't go
- Are you serious?
I decided, and I'd like to go
I looked at you one night
Nothing
Listen, write and tell me how you feel
about this: We're expecting a daughter
A light?
Passengers on flight 277 to Parls,
