{\an8}Hi, my name is Mili Naudiyal.
{\an8}I am 24 years old.
{\an8}Um... Uh...
I live with my father.
I am nursing...
I am a BSc Nursing graduate.
I forgot.
{\an8}You're a traveler
I am a traveler
{\an8}You're a traveler
I am a traveler
{\an8}Down the road together we go
{\an8}Down the road together we go
{\an8}You're a traveler
I am a traveler
You're a traveler
I am a traveler
Down the road together we go
{\an8}Down the road together we go...
Even if the path's filled
With thousands of obstacles
Even if the path's filled
With thousands of obstacles
Come what may
Together we go
On this road
Full of hardships and separation
{\an8}And bane that go hand in hand
{\an8}But you're wrong
If you think I'll give up
{\an8}I will conquer every grief
You're a traveler
I am a traveler
{\an8}Down the road together we go
The tea is in the table.
In means inside.
The tea isn't left inside.
This is where I always get confused.
The tea is on the table.
That's correct.
Not correct.
When you speak correctly without checking
the book, that's when you are correct.
It would've been correct
if you had sent me to an English school.
This is what you'll get
for the fee you paid.
Papa, if you're done
with the laughter challenge,
come out of the shower quickly,
I am getting late.
Papa?
Yes, child.
Are you smoking in there?
No, I am not.
- You erased the evidence.
- Evidence? What evidence?
Don't change the topic.
- Papa...
- Yes, child.
- Smoking increases...
- Blood pleasure.
That's pressure.
Increases blood pressure and can
lead to heart attack and cancer.
And what does that mean?
It means... a one-way ticket to heaven.
You have five minutes to get dressed.
Hurry up.
He knows everything
and yet does as he pleases.
Leave your phone at least while eating.
Good morning, Uncle Mohan.
Good morning, child.
- Come have breakfast, Mili.
- No, I have eaten.
Let me know
when mom's medicines get over.
I will, Uncle Mohan.
Why are you never late?
My heart starts beating frantically
as the clock strikes nine.
Devki Negi who's undergone labor pains
five times, is scared of a needle?
Here. Inject me.
Wasn't that a bit over the top?
Fine. Go ahead.
- Is it done?
- Done.
There's magic in your fingers.
Exactly.
Listen, Niranjan was here.
You're out of cholesterol pills,
and please come to the point.
Look, he doesn't like you going
to Canada one bit.
He's very depressed.
He's completely broken inside.
I am not glad to leave
Dehradun either.
Our house is called Mili-Home
only for namesake.
It ought to be called Debt-Home.
The bank's waiting to evict us.
You know all this and yet...
You can find a job
out here too, child.
I can make more money there
than what a doctor makes here.
And you know all about papa's health.
He can't be running around anymore.
All this while he was wasting time,
and now when he's ready,
immediately he'll shout, "Mili".
Mili!
Let's have a glass in the evening.
- There's an audit going on.
- Don't give me such excuses.
Make all the arrangements.
She is coming.
Uncle Mohan, papa has already
had his monthly quota.
I didn't even mention the word peg.
He was making gestures.
I said let's have a glass.
It could be tea as well.
Whatever it is, whoever did it,
your quota's over and that's it.
Finished.
Papa, did you go over
to Uncle Mohan's place yesterday?
Uncle Mohan?
- Uncle Mohan's house?
- No.
I'll sock you in the back if you lie.
Neighbors often visit each other, child.
And often they forget.
There's nothing to lie about.
Taking everyone into account, that makes
six people who've talked to me about it.
Mr. Niranjan, can I ask you something?
Yes.
How much money can you make in a month,
by selling insurance
policies door-to-door?
Why do you want to know, child?
Why do you think I am doing
a part-time job after IELTS classes?
To kill time, what else?
- Papa...
- What do you want to hear, child?
You're leaving me behind
and going to Canada.
Go on.
In fact, you can go
someplace that's even farther.
Didn't you go to Dubai
leaving me and mom alone?
I didn't go there
to watch camel races.
I'm not going to watch ice hockey either.
Look ahead.
I am looking ahead.
Stop here.
Get down.
Rs. 150.
Shall I round it off to Rs. 200?
If you want to have it your way,
then why ask?
Papa!
Who is calling?
Mr. Parmar's uncle's daughter, Same era.
You can make friends in your own circle.
Nothing is ours or theirs,
it's all an illusion.
It's your WhatsApp forward.
You think that's funny?
Family is family, child.
I forwarded you this as well.
Remember?
Exactly.
You're always confusing me.
Is it done yet,
or are you rounding it off to 200?
It's done, sir.
Don't make an excuse like yesterday
that you didn't see my missed call.
Hope your phone is not on silent mode?
Then take the pill before food
when you see the missed call.
And then the rest of the pills.
By the way, how will you continue this
missed-call-reminder-system from Canada?
Daytime in Canada will be nighttime here.
Papa, there's also an alarm on your phone.
Let's go, papa.
Yeah, many explained this system
to their parents before leaving.
- You mean I'm like them.
- That's not what I said.
Then what did you say?
I only said that it's happened before.
What rubbish you spout!
Okay.
Listen. This friend of yours, Same era,
will she buy that new policy?
Sell it to your family.
After all, family is family.
- Right.
- Absolutely right.
The pluperfect, usually called
the past perfect in English,
is a type of verb form.
Examples in English are...
Did you get an exam date?
No. I want to prepare
properly this time.
Bye.
I've already failed twice,
I cannot repeat that.
Written exams are okay.
But I completely freeze during the orals.
- Watch English movies.
- I am not allowed to watch at home.
English movies have
adult scenes, apparently.
On TV? How silly...
Madam, give me a look, please?
Just give me a look
and I'll drop you home tonight.
Wait. Wait.
Thank you.
We supply to four locations from here.
What if we get a call from the superiors?
- I'll get things ready for tomorrow.
- Hey...
{\an8}What did you say?
{\an8}- Tomorrow?
- Today!
{\an8}Laddoo, from now on,
you'll only say "today".
DOON'S KITCHEN
{\an8}Manager Sudhir Malkoti has deleted
the word "tomorrow" from your dictionary.
{\an8}- Should I explain?
- I got it, sir.
{\an8}Out.
And what is this?
Is this how it's kept?
{\an8}Keep it out like this.
Why are you fiddling
around with that stick?
{\an8}Move back.
Up. Down. It's very simple.
{\an8}Up. Down.
Up. Down.
{\an8}Up. Down.
Up. Down.
{\an8}Up. Down.
Remember that.
Even a blade of grass won't move here
without Sudhir Malkoti's will.
Punch in.
{\an8}Welcome to Doon's Kitchen.
Can I take your order, please?
{\an8}Never turn back
When you come to a dead end
{\an8}Keep challenging your limits
{\an8}Never turn back
When you come to a dead end
{\an8}One can always forge their own path...
{\an8}What will it take for you guys to learn?
{\an8}- How to handle the customer...
- Excuse me.
Is your chicken in-house
or is it from outside?
{\an8}Sir, our chicken...
{\an8}Very soft and crispy.
That's not what I asked.
{\an8}Sir, he's the right person.
{\an8}Laddoo.
{\an8}- Handle him.
- Sir!
Is your chicken in-house
or is it from outside?
{\an8}Is there a problem, sir?
I just wanted to know if the chicken
is in-house or if it is from outside.
{\an8}Sir, the chicken are
from our own poultry farm.
{\an8}We don't use anything from outside.
{\an8}That's good.
Your English is very good.
{\an8}Thank you, sir.
{\an8}You're a traveler
I am a traveler
{\an8}You're a traveler

Hello, Doon's Kitchen.
Can I take your order, please?
{\an8}Mili, please forgive me this time.
I said please.
{\an8}Sorry, sir.
Out of stock.
{\an8}Hello, Mili...
{\an8}Was it Sameer?
{\an8}What did he do this time?
{\an8}I mean, he should have
some responsibility.
{\an8}He had an interview yesterday.
But he was out playing cricket.
And he lied to me
that the interview didn't go well.
{\an8}Whenever I tell him something,
it's the same old story.
"I'm getting rent from the shop."
{\an8}Couldn't you guess from the first meeting?
{\an8}He was admitted
at your hospital for violence.
You fell in love with him
instead of getting scared.
In my experience,
any guy from Dehradun
who screams "mummy"
instead of uttering cuss words
while getting injected,
has to be a good guy.
And he is.
You're out of your mind.
{\an8}Don't you and Prakash ever fight?
{\an8}You're being lenient with him.
{\an8}You'll realize it after you get married.
{\an8}Oh...
{\an8}Can't stand a word
against the husband...
Hi. One veg burger.
Wait a minute.
Brother, there is no
trace of butter in this
nor can I taste it.
Sorry, sir.
Maybe there was less butter.
But we're being charged in full.
- Papa!
- Sorry, sir.
Did you come to watch a movie
or find butter in the popcorn?
I came for the popcorn.
I'm only watching the movie for your sake.
- I see.
- I came along because it's 3D.
I really wanted to watch
Chhota Chetan when I was in college.
But I had a broken leg,
as I had fallen off my bicycle.
You could've watched it in '98
when it was released again.
Even you were released in '98, child.
If I had gone to watch a 3D film
leaving you and your mom at home,
the world would've shunned me.
You had a problem with what others
would say, not in watching the film.
I can't see a thing wearing these.
You're not supposed
to wear it yet, papa.
- I see...
- Put it on after the movie starts.
Then why do they give it beforehand?
Keep explaining the dialogues to me.
I can't understand their English.
There will be subtitles.
Go inside.
The subtitles do not stay on the screen
long enough for me to read.
Is he your papa?
Hey... what did you say?
Nothing.
I only asked if you are her papa.
I see... Allow me, son.
Come this side, child.
What were you asking?
Am I her papa?
No. I am her older brother.
And her stepbrother.
Watch the film.
You disconnected my call again.
Mili, I said I am sorry.
Please forgive me.
I cannot forgive you.
Now leave, please.
You haven't answered my calls or
returned my texts in the last three days.
Mili, the movie's begun.
- Keep telling me the dialogues.
- Okay.
- Tell papa who Same era is.
- Popcorn?
No...
Sameer, please go.
I won't go.
If you don't forgive me,
I'll fall at your feet. Shall I?
Sameer, please. Papa's here.
I know.
I can see him.
So just forgive me,
otherwise he will see me.
Okay, fine. I forgive you.
- Now leave.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Should I go?
No, wait for my dad to beat you up.
No, I won't get beaten up.
Only after you say I love you.
What did the hero say?
I love you, sir.
But they were saying
something else right now.
That's why I don't like their movies.
You can't make head nor tails of it.
Those Telugu dubbed movies
on TV are much better.
Here.
These bright days
What would they be without me?
I know I am still delicate
These are my reflections
The beautiful moments
The smiling moments
{\an8}When I see myself in them
All I say is...
I am me
I am me
{\an8}I am me

Your colleague,
what's his name?
I just read on WhatsApp.
The cosmic rays will cross
over earth tonight.
These rays will enter
your brain through your phone.
{\an8}Every morning
Brings a new joy
{\an8}Every dusk
Brings a beautiful dream
It's a beautiful life
{\an8}Silky, velvety
{\an8}I have love, care and friendship
{\an8}That's all I need
I am me
I am me...
Hey...
Leave him.
{\an8}If I see you again...
- Mili...
- Yes, papa.
Where's the remote, child?
I hum to the tunes of life...
Mili.
It's very hot.
Switch on the fan.
Mili, my back is itching.
I can't reach it.
Scratch my back.
Scratch it with this.
I am loved,
Raised with a lot of care
Everyone knows
I can...
Papa, the results are out.
I did it.
It's good news, papa.
I am me...
Sameer?
The IELTS scores are out.
I am me...
Congratulations.
I am me...
Bye.

Lights on again!
Shut it! Useless fellow!
Or I'll put out your lights
in your house.
Turn off your light first,
Mili is coming.
Hi, sir.
Hasleen, child, how are you?
I am good. And you?
Top of the world!
What is the matter?
He seems to be in a good mood today.
I know the reason for his joy.
See you.
- Bye, sir.
- Bye, child.
Are you sure there's no more?
There's more.
- What?
- There's more.
{\an8}They won't come flying to me, right?
{\an8}Go get them.
{\an8}What is all this, papa?
{\an8}If you secretly smoke
so many cigarettes...
{\an8}Do you want me to keep running
to the hospital like you?
{\an8}It wasn't mom's fault
that she fell sick.
{\an8}Hospitals, the smell of medicines,
those are my only childhood memories.
{\an8}Here.
If anything happens
to you in my absence...
then what will I do?
I'm only asking for your support.
I'll do all the hard work.
{\an8}You must do it.
{\an8}I'll do it, child.
{\an8}But...
{\an8}with your permission,
{\an8}only if you allow,
can I smoke one last time?
{\an8}Can I ask a question?
{\an8}Can I smoke only one cigarette
every day after dinner?
{\an8}No...
{\an8}I quit smoking.
{\an8}I quit.
Cigarettes stink, papa.
It won't bother you from tomorrow.
You guys are non-vegetarians,
{\an8}that's why you can stay
in here for so long.
{\an8}I am a pure vegetarian.
{\an8}I'll freeze to death in here.
{\an8}Doesn't matter if you're
a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian.
{\an8}- Hello.
- Hello, Mili.
{\an8}- Hello.
- Hello.
{\an8}- Are you leaving, Mili?
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Hello!
- I will freeze in two minutes...
{\an8}Can you hear me now?
{\an8}I've been trying to call you for so long.
Where are you?
{\an8}Where else?
On the job.
Starting tomorrow,
I will give you the same answer.
{\an8}- You got it.
- Got it.
Congratulations, Sameer.
That's big news.
But listen, the job is in Delhi,
{\an8}- and I must leave tomorrow.
- Oh...
Shall I wait until you leave for Canada?
{\an8}- And anyway...
- Don't start again, please.
{\an8}This is what we were waiting for.
It's such a good opportunity.
Don't miss it.
{\an8}Listen, I'm leaving early today.
{\an8}- Why?
- Aren't we meeting?
Of course, we're meeting today.
Definitely.
{\an8}Then come pick me up.
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.
Oh, man!
Does anyone have some chewing gum?
{\an8}I've been married for six months.
{\an8}Have you ever seen me leave early?
{\an8}No.
{\an8}But there's no point in telling you.
{\an8}So go. Do as you please.
{\an8}Thank you, sir.
This won't happen from tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
{\an8}You'll never learn, will you?
{\an8}In fact, you can leave
early tomorrow as well.
{\an8}I'll finish whatever work is pending.
{\an8}Don't just stand there.
Go on.
Hello.
- I am leaving tomorrow.
- I know.
Listen.
Almost all jobs
in Delhi pay a higher salary.
Why don't you try in one
of the hospitals out there?
- So you don't...
- Have to go to Canada.
- I am going.
- Hey.
It doesn't matter what I say,
you've made up your mind.
I see...
Okay, fine.
I'll ask my mom
to find someone else for me.
Continue praying for someone else.
Listen, are you really going
to marry someone else?
What choice do I have?
This way I don't have
to convince mom either.
That I love someone from a different
caste and that I want to marry her.
- Great.
- Isn't it?
Then I won't have to talk to papa either.
About what?
About you.
You were going to tell your dad about me?
Yes. I was waiting for you to find a job.
But it doesn't matter.
What's the point now? This is great.
What's great? I was only pulling your leg.
I wasn't really going to do it.
Stop. Stop.
Park on the side.
Sir, there was a freshers party
in the college so...
Where's your helmet?
I forgot it at home.
Get off the bike.
Get down, Mili.
It's getting late.
Come here.
I'll be back in a minute.
Don't worry.
- Sir.
- What?
He forgot his helmet.
So, handsome, where's the party?
No party, sir.
I was dropping her home.
Who is she?
Friend, sir.
Girlfriend?
Lover?
Doesn't matter if you break your head,
let your parents cry.
But you must make
an impression on the girl.
Pay the fine and leave.
- Find anything?
- I only have 200.
Unlucky guy... we caught you
talking on a phone worth Rs. 20,000.
This is all I have, sir.
Don't lie.
Or your phone will explode.
Hop on, quickly.
Let's get out of here.
- I don't understand...
- Hop on, Mili.
- But what...
- Hello.
Are you in a hurry?
It's getting pretty late, sir.
That it is.
Mukesh.
Blow.
You can't keep secrets from me.
I told you to blow in this, boy.
Now blow.
You failed.
What's your name?
Sameer Kumar.
Your turn, girl.
Come on.
Even if you are drunk,
the law cannot lay a finger on you.
He was the one driving.
So let it be.
Madam, is there a problem?
Where do you live?
Rajendra Nagar...
Huh?
Rajendra Nagar!
What's your name?
Mili.
Full name.
Mili Naudiyal.
Give me your father's number.
- There's no need for this, sir.
- Of course, there is.
We can't leave her out here
all alone at this hour.
What if something happens to her?
- Come on, take down the number.
- Yes, sir.
Sir, please don't file any case.
Shut your stinking mouth.
- Come on.
- Sir, let it be.
The girl lives nearby.
Let's not drag the family into this.
If she can roam around
with a guy like him at this hour,
she shouldn't have any trouble
getting in the car with us.
We've a female constable, don't we?
- Yes, sir.
- Then?
Let's go.
Sameer Kumar.
- Yes.
- What does your father do?
My father is no more.
Another cup for that junkie.
What about your family?
Just mom and me.
Sir, what about my tea?
You want tea?
No, sir. Since he's sleeping,
I thought this one is for me.
- Mobile number?
- Who's sitting over there?
- 93...
- 93...
- 84...
- 84... 84?
What about the rest of the numbers?
- Yes. 74...
- 74...
- 75...
- 75...
- 89.
- 89.
Sir, I got a call from
the police station. I was called.
Who are you?
- I think my daughter...
- Wait a minute.
Sir.
The girl's father is here.
Send him in.
Come.
Come, sit here.
Sir, she's my daughter.
Sit down.
- Did something happen...
- Nothing happened.
Don't worry.
Come, child. Papa is here.
Do you know this boy?
No, sir.
So this affair is outside
the family's knowledge.
I arrested him for drunk-driving.
Your daughter was with him.
Anyway, this is your personal matter.
I shouldn't interfere.
But since we're public servants,
it's our duty...
Not me, sir.
- It's him.
- What's wrong?
He's a junkie, sir. Let it be.
He's not in his senses.
- Better explain to him.
- Yes.
I was saying, they are
not children anymore.
I am sure your daughter has a job.
Am I right?
Yes.
I know love is blind,
and I also know that boys
like him have a talent
to impress naive girls.
But if you are imagining
a future with someone,
do a background check
before starting an affair.
How is the guy?
Is he responsible?
Or will he land you in a police station?
That's the only reason I informed you.
The rest is up to you.
So, sir...
Yes, you may take her.
KOTWALI CANTT POLICE STATION
Papa...
If the dates are flexible,
we can look for another option.
She wants to leave at the earliest.
Doesn't matter if the rates
are on the higher side.
Book the earliest tickets possible.
- Okay, sir.
- Anything else?
No, sir.
We have all your documents.
Ma'am.
Ma'am.
Papa.
Punch in.
What do you do when the stocks arrive?
Don't look at each other.
Did you forget?
What happened?
{\an8}Were you in charge of checking
the fresh stock yesterday?
Yes. Me and Laddoo.
{\an8}A rat got in yesterday
and ruined everything.
- The manager's looking for you.
- Don't you clean...
{\an8}- No, sir. I...
- What?
{\an8}Oh... you're here, princess.
I was waiting for you.
{\an8}You guys can sit and laugh
at the next inspection,
{\an8}because I am here to take the fall.
{\an8}I have told you a thousand times,
{\an8}when the stocks arrive, check them
properly and keep them inside.
{\an8}At least 10 boxes
have been destroyed.
{\an8}See...
{\an8}A total loss of Rs. 6,000.
{\an8}Is your father going to pay for it?
{\an8}What?
What are you glaring at?
{\an8}You don't look so stressed
when you want to leave early.
{\an8}Next time anyone makes a mistake,
I won't be talking.
{\an8}You'll be seeing my worst side.
{\an8}Now pick this up!
{\an8}Throw it out!
{\an8}Move!
Sameer. Eat your food.
{\an8}Great.
{\an8}Doesn't matter how long
the queue is outside,
{\an8}but we must enjoy our food.
{\an8}Great. Continue.
{\an8}Continue eating.
{\an8}There's no hurry.
{\an8}Log out.
{\an8}Okay.
{\an8}Hi, sir.
Can I take your order, please?
{\an8}Thank you, sir.
Mili.
Sir, can I take your order, please?
Mili, I want to talk to you.
Please come out for a minute.
Sir, may I take your order, please?
Mili, I must talk to you right now.
{\an8}Sir, if you haven't decided yet,
{\an8}then you can wait on the side and decide.
{\an8}Other customers are waiting.
{\an8}- Mili, please...
- Excuse me.
{\an8}Ma'am, just one minute.
I'm leaving tonight, Mili...
Please.
{\an8}- Mili...
- Just two minutes...
{\an8}Can you please keep
your personal problems outside?
Don't you see the long queue
of customers waiting?
{\an8}Sorry, sir.
{\an8}And you can frolic around if you like,
{\an8}- but do it outside.
- Hey...
{\an8}One Pepsi, one french fries.
{\an8}You can speak to your staff later.
First, learn to attend to your customers.
{\an8}Take his order.
{\an8}Fast.
{\an8}One mega burger please.
{\an8}- Cash or card?
- Cash.
{\an8}- How much?
- Rs. 375.
{\an8}- You can pick up your order over there.
- Thank you.
{\an8}If he was remotely responsible,
would any of this have happened?
You're all set to go to Canada.
{\an8}Don't think about anything else.
It's already 7 pm.
{\an8}If I don't reach my sister-in-law's
place early for the event,
my mother-in-law
will make my life hell.
How will you go home?
{\an8}I'll take a rickshaw.
{\an8}Fine. See you tomorrow.
{\an8}Mili.
The person you're calling
is not answering. Please...
{\an8}Planning on doing a night-shift?
No, I'm just leaving.
Okay, fine.
See you tomorrow.
{\an8}- Bye.
- Bye.
Sameer, keep this box in your bag...
This boy is unbelievable.
- Hello.
- Reached home yet?
{\an8}No, I'm still here.
{\an8}Where?
Doon's Kitchen?
- Yes.
- It's almost 12 o'clock.
{\an8}Papa hasn't spoken to me since yesterday.
{\an8}I don't know how to face him.
{\an8}What's the confusion?
You talk to him.
{\an8}I don't know. I have a weird feeling.
Go home quickly, crazy girl.
{\an8}- But...
- Look, he's your father.
{\an8}He will understand.
Go home.
{\an8}Okay.
{\an8}What's the point of going home?
{\an8}She doesn't care what time I come home.
{\an8}We've been married for six months,
{\an8}but she hasn't let me touch her yet.
{\an8}Whenever I try to get close to her,
{\an8}she makes up some excuse
and says tomorrow.
{\an8}I lose my mind whenever
I hear the word "tomorrow".
{\an8}I even used that perfume you gave me.
{\an8}Sir...
It was of no use.
{\an8}It's such a nice perfume...
{\an8}Sir!
{\an8}Keep it there and go.
{\an8}We'll need soda.
{\an8}I've packed some Pepsi.
Let's go.
{\an8}I wasn't telling you,
it was the chicken delivery guy...
{\an8}- Hello.
- Oh, no...
{\an8}- Why doesn't he sleep at night?
- What is all this?
We were just going home, sir.
{\an8}I see... go on.
I'll keep these inside.
Because I am an employee of the company.
Go on.
No, sir. We'll keep it inside.
{\an8}Thank you.
{\an8}Come on, pick it up.
And keep it inside the freezer quickly.
Saved.
I thought grumpy saw us stealing Pepsi.
- Hurry up.
- Leave it. I work every day.
Punch out.
Hurry up.
Mili, will you please keep
these cartons in the freezer?
- Otherwise Mr. Grumpy won't let us leave.
- I'm going home.
Mili, it will only take a minute.
We've made some plans.
I know all about your plans.
- Who told you?
- No one told her.
- Mili, please.
- Please.
- Please...
- Please...
Okay, fine.
Thank you.
How can I carry all three?
Keep it over there.
Let's go. Let's go.
God, I forgot to punch out.
- Wait, I'll be right back.
- Laddoo... you always get us late.
- Laddoo, come on!
- Punch out.
People are afraid of me.
Sir, we've placed them inside.
Sometimes I feel I should act
the same way at home too.
Then she will understand.
I cannot do that.
I mean she will call her mom.
And I'll be the one embarrassed.
I've to keep nodding my head.
Mom and daughter are crazy.
She doesn't let me touch her, and her
mom thinks something's wrong with me.
She wants to get
my sperm count checked.
I don't know...
Huh... How would I know
what's the issue?
I'll do something.
I won't let her go so easily.
Malkoti won't give up so easily.
I am not the manager of this
big branch for nothing.
What did you buy?
Vodka.
I've already tried these vodkas.
These bloody good-for-nothings.
Not you, man.
They left the refrigeration room ajar.
Wait, let me punch out.
Punch out.
I'll call you back in a while.
Sir.
Sir.
Sir!
Yeah...
Sir, I am still inside.
Sir.
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
Please, sir!
Sir, please!
Sir...
Sir!
Bro, the mall's closed now.
Let's get it tomorrow.
Sir!
Check that number.
Yes, that one.
Brother. What happened?
Hasn't Mili returned home yet?
Sometimes she's late.
She must be on her way.
Okay.
Sir, do you have any luggage?
The person you're calling
is not answering...
Can't you hear the phone ringing?
Hello, sir.
What?
She hasn't reached home yet?
No, I left early tonight.
Give me a minute.
I'll ask the others and call you back.
- Shyam.
- Yes.
- Mili hasn't reached home yet.
- I see...
When I was leaving,
she was in the pantry.
But Laddoo and Vipul left late.
- Yes.
- Did you see Mili while leaving?
Yes, Mili was there.
And our manager was there too.
Ask him.
Tomorrow, okay.
Who calls their boss at this hour?
Sir, Mili hasn't reached home yet.
But Mili had punched out before me.
Where could she be?
I don't know where she is.
It's not my responsibility
where one goes after they punch out.
Sir, I asked everyone.
Do you have any idea where she could be?
As I said, I don't know where she is.
Hello, sir.
I checked with everyone.
She has left Doon's Kitchen.
I see...
Okay, dear. I'll find out.
Okay.
DELHI
Help!
Please someone help!
Help!
Anybody there? Please!
Help!
Help, please!
Anybody there? Please!
Please...
Help!
Help!
Please help!
Papa...
There's some sound coming from inside.
I'll call you later.
It's nothing, son.
Let's go.
The person you are calling
is not answering...
- So your daughter left the mall.
- Yes, sir.
- That comes under Kotwali Cantt?
- Yes, sir.
- It's a different jurisdiction.
- So what now?
Go file a complaint with them.
Look, it's been a while.
Please hurry up.
Or you guys might be too late.
Okay.
Let's go.
Papa.
{\an8}Mili Naudiyal.
- Age?
- 24.
She gave me a missed call at 8 pm,
as a reminder to take my pills.
Mr. Naudiyal.
Seems that you like our station.
- You're back here again.
- Sir, his daughter is missing.
I see.
Did you ask your family and friends?
Yes, sir.
We called everyone up.
What time does she come home everyday?
12 o'clock, sir.
And you're okay with your girl
coming home so late?
Her shift ends at that time, sir.
What job ends at such a late hour?
She works at the Pacific Mall, sir...
She works in a restaurant
called Doon's Kitchen.
Did you ask her boyfriend?
No, sir.
She can't be with him.
You had no clue
that she even had a boyfriend.
I arrested them together yesterday,
and today she is missing.
Either you're naive or stupid.
Give him the boy's address.
Go check with him.
But, sir, our report...
I said go ask him.
If you still can't find her,
then we'll see what can be done.
- Give them the address.
- I will, sir.
Come.
Such a headache.
His daughter must be spending
the night with the boyfriend,
and the father's making our night hell.
Shall we go over to the boy's house?
I told you my daughter
cannot elope like this.
You don't have to tell me.
I'm only saying this
because maybe we can get
some more information.
Hello.
Sameer's phone is switched off.
Is he home?
He's not home.
- He's got a job in Delhi.
- When did he leave?
Tonight, by bus.
Is everything alright, mister?
Shall we?
Mummy...
The bone's slightly dislocated.
You're going to get
a holiday from school.
You'll be fine.
No need to be afraid.
I'll fix it in a second.
Close your eyes.
Close them properly.
- Any news yet?
- No.
And Sameer isn't picking up his phone.
Mili said he got a job in Delhi.
He's going there.
Niranjan, shall we go
to the police station again?
Wait a minute...
It's from his number.
Hello.
- Hung up.
- Call him back.
Yes.
Where is my daughter?
What do you mean where?
Tell me honestly, where is my daughter?
- I really don't know...
- You don't know?
Sir... I don't know!
If anything happens
to my daughter, then I will...
- Sir.
- I don't know what's going on.
How would I know where Mili is?
My phone's battery was low,
so I switched it off.
And I really didn't want to leave.
Mom called when I turned on my phone,
and I came straight here.
Usually, you two leave together.
I left early today.
I called Laddoo, and he said
she was still there when they left.
Then I called the manager.
The manager said everyone has punched out.
- Where are you, Mili?
- Hasleen.
Wait here.
Sir, he really doesn't know where Mili is.
We don't believe him.
Let's take him to the police station.
- Niranjan, get in the car.
- Sameer.
Let's go.
{\an8}Sir. You're getting a call.
- Who is it?
- From the station.
Yeah...
Sir, that missing girl...
See... she was with her boyfriend,
wasn't she?
No, sir.
They found the boy whom you suspected.
But the girl isn't with him.
- I'll be there in an hour.
- One hour?
That will be too late.
Are you the senior or me?
Just do as I said.
How can you do this, sir?
Every minute is hard for us,
wondering where my daughter is
and in what condition.
If you make us come
to the police station so many times,
then when will you find my daughter?
- How can you do your duty like this?
- Don't tell me how to do my duty.
It wouldn't have come to this
if you had civilized your daughter.
I'll come in an hour if I wish.
Now hang up.
Sorry. That's his nature.
You know what, check
with all her friends personally.
Maybe she got angry with you
and went to her friend's place.
They are her friends, after all,
maybe they lied to you
just to support her.
- No, sir. Mili would never do that...
- Quiet.
This is all your fault.
Let's check once.
- I'll call you as soon as he returns.
- Yes, okay.
You're coming with us in the car.
Yes, sir.
When we talked over the phone,
she sounded a little off.
- Do you know anything else?
- No, sir. I don't know anything.
- We talked in the afternoon.
- When did she call?
- I don't know.
- Do you remember what time?
Around 2 or 2:30.
I even asked her what's wrong.
But she didn't tell me anything.
Take another left...
- No, I don't think anyone else knows.
- Call me back if there's a problem.
Look, I don't know what you want.
We've checked everywhere
she might've gone.
If you two want to get married,
then you have my approval.
Just tell me where my daughter is!
I know what you think about me.
But I cannot stoop so low
just to get your approval.
Even I am worried about Mili.
I love her. I want to marry her.
But I assure you,
she will never marry me
without your approval.
Your daughter would never put
24 years of her upbringing at stake
just to spend her life with me.
I didn't have a job.
That's why she never introduced me to you.
If I was more responsible,
then we wouldn't have met like this.
It's all my fault.
Forgive me.
Sir, it's foolish to look
around for Mili like this.
We won't find her this way.
We must try to figure out
where she could be.
Mall, Chowk, around her class,
we've asked everywhere.
- No one's seen her.
- Sameer, maybe the temple.
She isn't there either.
She normally goes
to the temple from the mall.
If she didn't go to the temple,
then that means...
Hello.
Okay, sir. We're coming right away.
The senior inspector has arrived.
Let's go.
- You guys follow me.
- Okay.
Wait a minute.
There's another place.
Mili has a friend named Same era.
- Same era?
- She used to call her often.
Maybe she knows something.
Do you know her?
There's no Same era, it's Sameer.
Let's go.
All doors are closed
{\an8}And silence spread far and wide
{\an8}Like a venomous snake
The cold's gripping your body
{\an8}All doors are closed
And silence spread far and wide
{\an8}Like a venomous snake
{\an8}The cold's gripping your body
{\an8}The blood running through
Your veins has frozen
It's only your grit and strength
That are keeping you alive
Keep death at bay
Stay determined
Don't give up
You can't give up
{\an8}Hear me
Even though there's no hope
You still have to fight for life
Fight for life!
Fight for life!
Fight for life!
Fight for life!
Fight for life!
Where will we look for her at this hour?
This is not some village
spread over a kilometer.
But sir, this is the police...
Sir, Mili visits the temple
every day after the mall.
Mostly with Hasleen.
But Hasleen left early today.
We asked around the temple,
but she didn't go there.
Sir, I think something happened
between the mall and the temple.
If you can track her last
location from her phone,
then maybe we can find
out where she is.
Wow... I didn't know
it was possible to do this.
- Sir, I was just...
- Just what?
You're her boyfriend, right?
You must know where she is.
Sir, she stopped talking
to me after last night.
Did Romeo and Juliet have a fight?
Why was your phone switched off
when they were calling you?
I was traveling to Delhi
and my phone battery was low.
Since you couldn't score with her, you're
trying to score with a new girl in Delhi.
No, sir. I've got a job.
I see.
Your job's in Delhi, and you're here. Why?
What did you say your name was?
Sameer Kumar.
Yeah...
Mili Naudiyal.
Sameer Kumar.
You're playing a nice game.
- Sir...
- Wait. I am talking to him.
Come with me.
I know how to pull the right strings.
I'm asking you politely,
tell us where the girl is.
Everyone can go home happily.
Honestly, sir, I don't know.
Let me ask you again,
where is the girl?
Believe me, sir, I don't know.
Do you think cops are dumb?
- Sir...
- Do not interfere.
This is an interrogation.
- Tell us where she is.
- Sir, I don't know!
- Where is she?
- I don't know!
- Which brothel did you sell her to?
- What are you saying?
You've raised hell over
that girl's disappearance.
- Hey...
- What are you doing?
If you utter another word
about my daughter...
I'll charge you with so many sections,
you'll never get bail!
What's going on here?
What's happening here?
Sir, this man is misbehaving with me.
He's created a row
over his child's disappearance.
What do you mean disappeared?
- How long?
- It's been four hours, sir.
This is our third trip
to the police station.
The first time he sent us back
without taking our complaint.
Said, "Go look for yourself."
The second time he wasn't here.
When we called, he said he'd come
back after an hour if he wants to.
Now when we asked him to track her mobile,
he started beating up this boy over it!
What is all this?
- Sir...
- Why didn't you call the cyber cell?
What have you been doing for four hours?
- It was pretty late, so...
- So what?
The cyber cell works 24 hours!
You know the consequences
of delayed action in such cases?
If anything happens to the girl,
who will be accountable? You?
- What is the status of the girl's phone?
- It's ringing but no one's picking up.
It's still ringing.
Call up the cyber cell right now,
and keep me updated.
Go on.
Tell me everything.
The shop was closed when I got there.
{\an8}The manager said
that Mili had punched out.
{\an8}- Call him.
- Yes.
{\an8}- Hello.
- Inspector Ravi Prasad speaking.
Order, sir.
{\an8}- An employee of yours...
- Mili, sir.
{\an8}Mili is missing since last night.
{\an8}Do you know anything about it?
- She had left the restaurant, sir.
- I personally checked the punch-out list.
{\an8}Are the punch-out details online?
Yes, sir.
{\an8}Send it to this number immediately.
Sir, there's a network problem...
{\an8}If there's no network, hang
from the balcony or climb a mountain.
{\an8}But I want the details
in two minutes, understood?
{\an8}- Or should I visit you personally?
- You'll get it in one minute, sir.
{\an8}- And keep the phone handy.
- Yes, sir.
{\an8}Idiot.
Sir, there is one thing
that I told him as well.
{\an8}Mili goes to the temple every day.
{\an8}In any condition.
Even if she's sick.
- But she didn't go there today.
- Sir, message from the manager.
{\an8}According to these details,
Mili has punched out.
She didn't go to the temple.
Chances are, she's somewhere
around the mall.
Did she have an argument
with anyone in the last few days?
No, sir.
Sameer, that rickshaw guy
who troubled her...
{\an8}What rickshaw guy?
Sir, there's a guy who's misbehaved
with Mili a couple of times.
- Which rickshaw stand?
- The one outside the mall.
{\an8}- Can you recognize him?
- Of course, sir.
Maybe he can tell us something.
Get the car.
{\an8}Go on ahead. I am coming.
- Did you get the girl's picture?
- Yes, sir.
{\an8}- Send it to all the police stations.
- Okay.
And get the CCTV footage
from around the mall.
Right, sir.
I've informed the cyber cell, sir.
{\an8}- Call me as soon as they find out.
- Yes, sir.
Let's go, Hari.
I called the manager,
he said everyone's punched out.
We've checked everywhere she might be.
According to these details,
Mili has punched out.
I called Laddoo.
He said Mili was still there when he left.
Sir, stop the car.
Stop the car, please.
- What happened?
- What?
- Where are you going?
- One minute.
Will you take them to the rickshaw guy?
- I will.
- Get off.
- But what happened?
- Just do as I say. Get in the car.
- Can someone tell me what's going on?
- I'll tell you when I get back.
Get in.
- Hello?
- Hello, Hasleen.
Yes, Sameer.
Vipul and Laddoo stay
in Jhandewali Lane, don't they?
- Yes, but why?
- Send me their number quickly.
But what happened...
Sir.
- The phone's switched off.
- What's the last known location?
Sir.
What happened?
You're getting a call.
Coming.
Can't even pee peacefully.
Sir, you're getting a call.
It's from the cyber cell.
- Maybe they got the location of the phone.
- Maybe, maybe not.
They hung up before I could answer.
When you're calling someone,
do it properly.
What is this?
Not a minute of peace in this lifetime.
Hello.
Sir, the phone was switched
off two minutes ago.
According to the tower,
her last location was...
Yes. What's her location?
Fine. Send it to me on WhatsApp.
No, I'll forward it to him.
Okay.
Wow!
Amazing.
Bravo.
What happened?
- That's him.
- Where's the girl called Mili?
I don't know anything.
Don't know!
Tell me honestly.
I don't know, sir.
I would've told you if I knew.
I really don't know.
- You don't know.
- Sir, sir...
I know he's a rowdy,
but he's been here all day.
We didn't go anywhere
since there were no customers.
- Take down his name, address and number.
- Yes, sir.
What's your address?
- Hello.
- Where are you?
Coming, Firoz. Hang up.
- Hey.
- When you danced..
- It was fun.
- Drunk and...
- Rascal... you said Mili left after you.
- What happened?
Then why is your punch-out
time after hers?
- Tell me.
- We were leaving.
But that bloody manager told us
to keep the boxes in the freezer.
I saw that Mili was punching out.
I forgot to punch out,
that's why my time was after hers.
So Mili left before you did?
No. We gave her the boxes
to keep in the freezer.
- Where?
- The freezer.
- Hello.
- Hello, Firoz.
Tell the senior inspector to check
the shop's freezer immediately.
Hello.
Hello? Firoz?
Give me your phone.
Where's your phone?
It's in our room.
What happened?
Think carefully.
Where else can she be?
Mili never goes anywhere
without informing me.
What about the CCTV footage?
Sir, we checked the footage
from the shop next door.
- The girl was nowhere in sight.
- And the mall's footage?
Sir, the mall's manager isn't picking up.
What do you mean he isn't picking up?
Where does the manager live?
He lives close by, in Galaxy Apartments.
I'll be right back.
Did the cyber cell call?
Mr. Satish called.
He said he's trying.
- Ask him to hurry up.
- Okay, sir.
Come on.
- Sir, what are you doing?
- Send them the location.
Bloody seniors.
What do they think?
They will get transferred here,
and bark orders at us.
They want to show us their power,
don't they?
He can't do squat
if I don't forward the location.
- But the girl's life could be in danger.
- So what?
She's not my wife or girlfriend.
Does she mean anything to you?
Yes?
Where to?
- I'm getting some water, sir.
- Can't see what's right under your nose.
- Do you want more?
- No.
Whose ass is on fire?
I'll get him sober.
Open the door.
What is your problem?
Do you think it's funny?
Is it funny now?
Still funny?
I'll show you...
Take that.
Now laugh.
Now laugh.
If I see you grinning again,
you'll never smile again in your life.
Bloody junkie. Shut it.
Yes, Mukesh.
Sir, we got the location.
Drive faster. Faster...
Good night.
Bro, are you all right?
Bro... can you hear me?
Wake up.
Are you hurt?
Do you want some water?
Should I take you to the hospital?
Pacific...
Take me to Pacific Mall.
Give me a cigarette.
Hasleen said Mili didn't know
how to face me.
She tried to talk to me several times,
but I ignored her every time.
Why didn't I talk to her?
Why was I so furious?
What did my child do?
I wish I had spoken to her,
then Mili would've been with me now.
Please calm down.
We will find her.
Listen, please don't stand here.
Go out.
Uncle, his daughter hasn't returned
home since last night.
Listen, does your daughter
work in the mall?
Yes. Doon's Kitchen.
Do you have a picture of her?
Did you check everywhere she might go?
Yes.
Sir, I think your daughter
didn't leave the mall.
Sir, the watchman is saying
that Mili hasn't left the mall.
The location is right here.
She could be anywhere.
Search everywhere.
Open quickly.
Left. Left.
In the front.
Give me a torch quickly.
- Where's the manager?
- He's on his way.
Tell him to hurry up.
Or break the door.
Mohan, I'll check that side.
What happened, sir?
You're a traveler
I am a traveler
You're a traveler
I am a traveler
Down the road together we go
Down the road together we go
Even if the path's filled
With thousands of obstacles
Even if the path's filled

Come what may

- Manager, open quickly.
- Come on, fast.
Child.
Child.
Child.
Give way!
Child.
Child.
Child.
Papa.
- You're a traveler...
- Lift her up!
- I am a traveler...
- Move...
Move aside...
You're a traveler,
I am a traveler...
There are some complications,
but nothing to worry about.
The good news is,
you brought her to the hospital
before hypothermia set in.
There are frostbites all over her body,
but they will heal.
What surprises me most is this...
We cannot stand the cold
when the AC is running at 17 degrees.
And your daughter spent
five hours in minus 18 degrees
in normal clothes.
I don't know how
she was able to survive this.
She's a very strong girl.
Thank you.
- Why didn't you put in an alarm?
- I don't need it, sir.
Early to bed, early to rise, you know.
I am talking about a safety alarm
in the restaurant's freezer.
- Sorry, sir. I thought...
- Your license will get canceled.
I'll get it done, sir.
- Hello.
- Sir, I got a call from the cyber cell.
- They have found the girl's last location.
- Did you get this information just now?
The girl could've lost her life,
do you know that?
The public doesn't want to go to the cops
because of people like you.
- But sir, I...
- Shut up!
Wait there.
- I'll come over and...
- Sir, sir...
We're in a hospital.
Hang up.
- Shop license.
- I'll put in the alarm, sir.
Papa.
Yes, child.
What time is it?
He's taken his pill before food.
Get some rest.
What is this?
I got into a fender bender.
I am okay.
It's not serious.
You didn't join your job?
Not correct, child.
He wouldn't be here if he had joined.
What friendship.
Answering each other's questions.
Can we consider him our own now?
We'll adjust.
- Papa.
- Yes, child.
You thought that I...
Papa, I will never leave you.
I'll stay with you.
Together.
I'll manage.
Think about it, child.
Nurses don't get a handsome salary here.
Am I right, nurse?
Yes, the money is less.
But this is where home is.
We manage, sir.
So... let's manage it together.
It's decided then.
- Can you get these medicines, sir?
- Give it to me.
I will get it.
Hey.
Sit. Sit.
I was going to ask you
to keep an eye on her.
But I guess I don't have to tell you.
Will I be forgiven?
Papa, where were you?
- I was around here.
- Smoking cigarettes again.
No.
Your hands smell of cigarettes.
It's just...
- Sir.
- I'll tell mom.
How is your daughter now?
She's awake.
No need to worry.
By the way, how were you so convinced
that my daughter was in the mall?
I've been working as a guard for 35 years.
Every day, thousands
of people come and go.
No one would pay attention to me,
nor talk to me.
We never really had a conversation,
but your daughter
would smile at me every day.
I was convinced because I didn't see
her smile yesterday evening.
When someone pays attention
to someone who is often ignored,
then he can never forget
that person and her smile.
I'll take your leave now, sir.
It's time to report to duty.
I forgot to ask, sir.
What is your daughter's name?
Hear me, O Mili
Hear me, O Mili
This life is full of sorrows and joys
Wait, O Mili
The moments that...
That moments that pass by
Every moment spent here
Is precious
All of us
Walk on with life
Hear me, O Mili
At some point,
Dreams do come true
Hear me, O Mili
Don't ever
Give up
You're like the sun
The darkness
Will fade away
With courage
Comes victory
Know yourself
Believe in you
Who are we?
We realize that at some point
This path was paved with much expectations
We are humming
To the tunes of life
Let me dance
As well
Hear me, O Mili
This life
Is full of sorrows and joys
Wait, O Mili
Hear me, O Mili
Wait, O Mili
Hear me, O Mili
Hear me, O Mili
Hear me, O Mili
Hear me, O Mili
