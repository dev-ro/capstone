Sweetheart...

Your lover...
I...

Write...
Letter.
Oh no!
"Message"...
Should it be "note"?
No, let it be "letter" itself...
Read it.

Oh, you recited it as a song!

I first said "sweetheart" right?
Next, change it to "precious", okay?
My precious, are you doing well?
I'm fine here.

Oops! He changed it.
Wasn't it a lovely song?
Yeah.
We are late. Eat fast.
Eat quickly, man.
Don't we have to go?
Take a head count and get into
the vehicle. I'll come.
[In Tamil] What happened, Driver bro?
Been long since you came here.
Please come frequently.
Then only our business can survive.
It's Velankani season.
All the trips are to that side.
Oh, so you frequent
Velankani these days?
Brother, can you please
read this for me?
Brother, you go and
inform the priest.
Give me that newspaper.

Are they your friends?
-These are boys from Manjummel.
-Who?
Guys from Manjummel.
I happened to be in front of their club
while inviting guests for my wedding.
See, some thirty of them
turned up, shamelessly.
They're dancing like hell.
-Cool dudes.
-Yeah, right.
Just look at them.
No clue when they will start a fight.
Fight? Why?
Long ago, they were all part of
the same club. Yuva Darshana.
Now, that group is Yuva
and the other is Darshana.
Amazing.
All the best, dude.
-Sudhi, coming for some chilled water?
-Don't finish it all.
-Kuttan, aren't you coming?
-In a moment.
Where is Subhash, son?
He is dancing there merrily.
Must be drunk, eh?
Anyway, he'll come home walking.
I'll take care of him.
-You must keep an eye on him.
-Sure. You want a piece?
Eat more beef, man.
Isn't it yummy?
Kuttan, I didn’t get water.
Hey Sudhi, serve everyone some water.
Sis, serve them some water.
You do it, man!
Me? My shirt will be spoiled.
Damn shirt.
Dude, told you to
serve just water.
-It won't stain your shirt.
-How many times did you bathe today?
I drank and took a bath too.

Come here.
Dixon, hey!
Your brother is creating a scene.
Why are you shy?
Come, dance!
Don't you know him? He won't
listen to me. He is mad.
He is doing nonsense over there. The groom
looks so embarrassed. You go call him.
Shaming Darshana Club.
Go get him!
Scoundrel! Hey, Shiju!
-Shiju, come here you prick.
-Let's take a pic.
Just come down, you!
Let me enjoy.
Come, let's do family dance.
-Come with me. Mom is alone at home.
-You give company to her.
Dude, your dad has passed out. Come!
-I'll kick you if it's a lie.
-Okay, come now!
People are watching.
Come, dammit.
-You guys can't let me enjoy?
-Enjoy! Happy first night! Go rock!
He has lost it.
Sudhi...
Dude, remember me?
Dude... Prasad!
-How are you?
- All well.
We haven't met after
we left school. What's up?
Mejo is my friend.
Great!
-What do you do these days?
-Painting, brick work and all.
Don't tell me!
Dude, I am a contractor.
I have my workers.
Ha, that shows.
-Meet my friend Anil.
-Hello.
-He is Kuttan.
-Prasad.
-What about you?
-Driving a cab in Kalamassery.
-Which car?
-Indica.
That's great.
Our group has planned a trip for Onam.
-Call me then.
-Sure.
-How many people will be there?
-Some thirty of us.
-Are all of them your friends?
-Of course.
Noticed them.
They're partying hard.
-I'll call you.
-Wait, let me give you my card.
Hey, Kuttan!
Here he comes.
-Call me, okay?
-Sure, man.
I'm so glad that we met, man.
Come on, dude.
-Want a drink?
-No.
-Come and have a drink with us.
-No, I need to drive.
Another time. You guys enjoy.
I'll call you.

I'm going home.
Why don't you understand?
Let's quickly go and come back.
We won't drink without you. Promise.
Hey! Hey!
What's that?
What's the matter?
-Wanna hit me?
-Tell me what is the damn issue.
Yes, we lost the tug of war last week.
These jerks are making fun of us.
-Didn't we grind you on the floor?
-Get lost, you bastard.
-Don't make noise.
-Am I making noise or him?
You won't do shit.
Get lost, you!
Stop it! Stop!
Jinson brought up the tug-of-war
and started the fight.
That prick kicked my belly.
Don't you know them, dammit?
-He kicked me, man.
-Why, dude?
He kicked me because he lost tug of war.
-Tug of war is not child's play.
-Hey, nobody should create a scene.
-You kick if you can't win?
-Dude, you want a fight?
Come, let's do it now.
We should do a competition right now.
Let's see who wins.
-Now? Shut up, Subhash.
-If you are afraid, don't join. Go.
Don't do this.
If you are man enough, come now.
We dare you... Come!
Go, move that side. Let's see.
Hey, groom dear...
Just a sec.
Come on, boys. Start!
-Siju, are you OK?
-Yeah.
Hold the rope. Come on, guys!
Lift it, guys.
Come, pick up the rope.
Hold on. Tighten it!
Steady and strong... yes!
Don't give it up. Come on!
Pull! Drag it strongly!
Siju, drag it out of the line!
Come on..!
Come on, drag it.
Loosen it now, and pull!
Clinch it.
Yes, that's it. Yeah!
See you. Bye.
Sir, I'm leaving.
-Don't make this a routine.
-Sir, I have a practice session.
[Whistles]
Where the hell were you?
I've been waiting.
Talk softly, man.
Hey, Krishna Kumar...
Drop these tour photos
at the Eloor club.
Ah, best. You got only us?
What's this, man? You guys will fight.
And then become friends again.
I have seen this enough.
I'll leave late.
We are going for a tour this Onam.
Print such colour photos for us too.
-Why not? Tell me which shade to highlight.
-Sure, I will.
Bright red!
Hey!
-You're early.
-No work after 5. Union will ban you.
-It's the same chick, right?
-Oh, that one?
-These boys are such a nuisance.
-Give one to him!
Go home, you!
These talents should be nipped in the bud.
Shouldn't let them grow.
Didn't go to work today?
Your eyes are blood red, dammit.
Not going back?
-I'm fed up.
-Good for them.
The whole gang is here.
Working hard?
Hello!
See who all is here.
-Put on a peg already?
-What? No.
Let me sit.
Let me show you something. See.
Just started.
Let's be mature.
What's that, buddy?
The girl in the studio gave me this.
To give to the other club.
Their tour photos.
Awesome pics.
-Didn't give it yet?
-I already tore it.
Why didn't you give it?
Let them come and
collect if they want.
Am I so jobless?
What is it?
Oh, these losers!
What's there to see?
-Where did they go, man?
-Munnar.
We too have gone for tours.
Do we have even one photo?
Let me see.
One minute.
Shit, this is good.
Are you so jobless to
watch their photos?
-We'll look at your face then.
-Get lost.
Close that damn thing.
Didn't get anything better to do?
What did I do?
Here, take it.
Don't ruin them.
-So, what is our plan?
-What plan?
They regularly work and earn
money to spend on tours.
Here, some go to work once a week and
spend that money on adult movies.
Kuttan...
So, Goa plan is cancelled?
First, try to win a Tug of war.
Then we can think about a tour.
How is Goa related to tug of war, man?
I won't go with these guys.
I was lucky to return alive last time.
Pull it together... Yes, like that.
Pull it with all your strength.
-About the tour...
-Quiet! After the game...
We need to decide fast.
Then only we can take leave.
Let's finalise Goa.
Liquor is cheap there.
Foreign chicks too.
Even if we have to borrow
money, let's go to Goa.
We will lose our reputation.
Kuttan's marriage plans are final.
What's the topic?
Stop talking and concentrate!
-About the tour.
-Is it decided?
-Where are we going?
-Goa, dude.
Here they go. Dammit.
Kuttan bro, are we going to Goa?
Goa?
Dude, do you have any idea
where Goa is?
Titto has not got his vehicle.
Plan for Athirappilly or Varkala.
We go there usually, right?
Stop it, man.
What? Cancelled Goa plan?
Where else are we going then?
To Varkala?
Why do you think so local, guys?
To stand under the sun on the beach,
we have Cherayi nearby.
Think beyond Kerala, man.
By outside Kerala, I mean Pollachi,
Coimbatore or Pazhani.
Why not Kodaikanal?
That's near Pazhani.
It's a cold place. Nice mood.
It's Kodaikanal, bro.
Let's go to Kodaikanal.
Good. It's a new place.
Awesome place. You will see
bisons roaming on the road.
Which Jaison?
That guy from Koonamaavu?
-Has that loser moved there?
-What the..?
Not Jaison, bison.
Wild buffalo!
Ah, right.
You do one thing.
You have that old buddy, right?
-Who?
-The one who we met at the wedding.
The other guy.
-That driver guy.
-Ah, Prasad.
Hey Sudhi, what's up?
Dude, our tour plan is set.
To Kodaikanal.
You can you get that traveller van
you told us about that day?
Traveller... may not be free
due to Onam rush.
Then, there is a Qualis.
But your group is too big for it.
Only nine people will fit into Qualis.
More people will join
if it's Kodaikanal, OK?
It's a cold place.
Guys will come.
We have six people here itself.
I am confirmed. Don't leave me out.
Me too.
Okay, then. See you.
You guys have fun.
Dude, where are you going?
Aren't you coming tomorrow?
No, man.
What's the problem, Subhash?
Is it the money?
No, I need to take my mom
to grandma's place.
Sumesh is there at home, right?
Yeah, such a responsible fellow.
Okay, bye.
-Bye then.
-Hey, wait.
Dude...
What's wrong with him?
You can go via Madurai...
...also via Palani.
Palani route is easier.
Have you been to
any of these places?
Do you have any idea of
the places I have been to?
Oh, I have no clue of that.
Mom...
I have kept money in the
kitchen, for Onam purchases.
Okay. Hey...
Won't you be back by the 5th?
We need to go to Varappuzha.
What's there in Varappuzha
on the 5th?
Regarding the marriage proposal.
Oh, to meet the girl?
I will surely come before that.
Father, I am leaving.
Enjoy yourself.
Don't booze too much.
Just a little bit.
What you guys did isn't fair.
Vineesh, I don't know
how to make you understand.
Told you a hundred times already.
The vehicle could not be arranged.
Only nine people can go.
This is an interstate trip,
it could be a problem.
There were ten of us when
we booked the vehicle.
We were relieved when
Subhash opted out.
We skipped it because you
said the destination is Goa.
Now you say it is Kodaikanal.
You could have called a meeting.
-A meeting?
-Who is he?
If we hold a meeting in
the last minute, how will they go?
-That's what.
-We will have a blast next time.
We will surely organise
a trip in the near future.
We will have a blast then.
Pour him a drink to lift his mood.
I don't want it.
OK then, leave it.
Don't be upset, have one.
Kuttan...
The vehicle is here.
Has it come?
Hey, our vehicle is here!
It's here. See you later, brother.
Oh, my goodness!
-Happy journey!
-We'll be back soon.
Cab is here!
We're leaving. Happy Onam!
-Same pinch.
-Yeah, we got the same colour!
-You didn't call Sujith?
-Aren't they here yet?
Get in, don't waste
anymore time.
Okay, then. Bye.
All the best.
What do you mean all the best?
They are going to pay for this.
-What's your problem man?
-Get lost, man.
Leave him.
He'll curse us.
Scram, you!
What next?
Will you cry now?
Look at him.
Go die, morons!
There he is.
Sadu backed off.
They are distributing
bonus in his workshop.
He tried to get out, could not.
-He is really upset.
-That's sad.
-What do we do now?
-Let's do one thing.
Let's call Vineesh then.
Why call that bugger?
He was cursing us.
Leave it.
Or, why don't we call your brother?
Eww, Siju?
What's wrong?
How can two members of the
same family go on a trip?
What's the issue?
No, man.
It will be a mess.
Okay then, let's call Subhash.
Right, Subhash would be good fun.
Let's pick him.
-Shall I go and call him?
-Okay, quick.
By the way...
I don't have much money with me.
We will manage all that.
Do you have money for food at least?
We'll take care of it.
They are waiting over there.
Hurry up!
Yeah.
Oh, almost forgot my underwear.
Come fast.
What's playing, a serial?
-No, it's a movie.
-Okay.
Where are you all going?
To Kodaikanal.
We will be back
day after tomorrow.
Which day after tomorrow?
Day after tomorrow, for sure.
Hey, you have a happy Onam!
Yeah, sure.
-Subhash, come.
-Yeah, coming.
I'll take leave. Bye.
Got any cash?
Give me if you have.
Hey, that's my belt!
Shut up!
He is not going to eat it, is he?
I might even eat it.
Okay. Bye! Let's head
straight to Kodaikanal!
-Such a loser.
-Play some music, man!
Stop..!
Hey, what are you doing?
-He has come prepared.
-Who called him?
Then, what is he up to?
Only nine people can go, seats are full.
Siju, dear. We won't get permit.
We can't cross the check post.
No, Siju. You can't join.
If we both leave, parents
will be alone at home.
That's not the reason.
It's crammed. Get lost.
No way. I won't get out of this.
-What the hell?
-What are you doing, Siju?
See what he is doing.
-Okay, let's go.
-Hey!
-Open the door!
-Sorry, no space.
Open it, dammit!
Such a nuisance!
We are jam packed now.
We could have gone by train.
Don't stop anywhere now!
Drive straight to Kodaikanal!
Good lord!
It's freezing cold. My God!
Come, let's pray at the temple.
No.
Lord Murugan will be annoyed if
so many of us go up at this hour.
Yeah, right.
-Let's take a quick tour around.
-Okay, buddy.
Shall we?
-Look at the height.
-It's a breathtaking view at the top.
Take care of Jinson.
Hey, Jinson.
Let's buy some CDs.
Brother.
Give us some fast paced
songs to play in the car.
Take that. Yes.
[In Tamil] Which movie's songs?
Vijay songs!
This one is good.
-We're on a trip to Kodaikanal.
-Oh, Kodaikanal?
Give us something
with a boozy vibe.
Kamal Haasan hits.
This will warm you like a drink
as you climb the hill in the cold.
Superb!
-This will do.
-Fifty rupees.
Here you go,
fifty rupees.
Making good money, eh?
Siju...
-Why you never go to temples?
-I never had any interest in it.
Don't you believe in God?
Buddy, what is God?
God is...
That light coming
from the sky, right?
The sky is quite dark.
Eat your food now.
-Not like that.
-Don't be ridiculous.
Sometimes it's there.
Enough for now.
Spare me, dear.
Let's leave.
Play music!
Play that CD.
Yes, switch it on.
Do it fast, dude.
Everything’s up to
Kamal Haasan now.

We missed a place, man.
-Which place?
-Where is it?
-I've gone there. Amazing spot.
-Where is it?
Guna Cave.
Gonna Cave?
Not "Gonna," Guna.
Is it a cave?
-Just a cave?

Oh yeah, he abducts the girl there.

Let's go to Guna caves!
-Throw him out if he doesn't sit quiet.
-Just shut up.
Kick him out,
I'll tell some story to mom.
Why do you guys
always shut me up?
My ear has burst...
Come, let's go.
[In Tamil] What will customers think
if they see us fighting?
We are running a business here.
You've made it a habit.
Saw some cash
and you went mad!
I have not gone mad.
You have gone mad, shouting
in front of the shop!
I'm not shouting without reason
in front of your shop.
She is furious, man.
Dangerous.
Brother, what is the issue?
That's everyday ruckus.
Get something to eat and watch the fun.
-Does anyone want anything?
-Corn please.
Hey Valli, stop arguing with him
and look after the shop.
Quarreling as if the jungle
is in her name.
Wait, I'll deal with you later.
Got a comb?
No, I don't have.
[In Tamil] Which part of Kerala
are you from?
Kochi, Manjummel.
Kochi? Superb city.
Want some 'poondu',
the white one?
What on earth is poondu?
-Garlic.
-Oh, garlic.
It's not like what you get there.
This one is flavourful.
-Anything else?
-No bro.
How much is it?
Wait, I'll deal with you later.
How much in total?
One corn, one vada...
-Fifteen rupees.
-Fifteen!
Yes.
What's this, bro?
I charge fair price only.
If you earn like this, will this turn
into a restaurant when we come back?
It might rain.
Come back soon.
Eat from here on your way back.
This bro of yours will
wait for you, okay?
-OK, brother.
-Come back fast.
Come, come...
Okay, come back soon.
Here is our man. Hello!
Such tall tales...
[In Tamil] Hey, don't you know
this is a forest? Why are you smoking?
Siju was caught by the jungle police.
Sorry, Sir. Pick it up,
he didn't see it.
-Hey, keep discipline.
-OK, Sir!
Today's moment is tomorrow's memory, sir.
Stand as a group please.
We have got a camera.
[In Tamil] If you all take own photos,
what will we do sir?
Can you take a photo of ours?
Please, just one photo.
Smile please!
Come on now!
Off to the next spot.
-Thanks.
-It's OK. No problem.
-Siju.
-Yes?
Let me lie down for a while,
I will be in the vehicle.
Come, the view on top will be nice.
-I need to drive in the night.
-OK then, go ahead.
Hey, sicko!
I'll be in the vehicle, okay?
This place is the real "Manjummel"
- misty heights...
But where is mist here?
Remove your shades and see.
He's impossible...
Come, let's head back.
-What is under this?
-A deep pit, may be.
Jinson, what the hell?
Careful.
Come on, guys.
See this.
Come down, guys.
Why you want trouble?
It's a zoo or what,
all locked up?
Check this out.
No ruckus.
Come, let's go.
Hey, there is an actual cave here.
It is much below.
-That's one of a kind.
-Have you been there?
I have gone there with
Balakrishnan and team, long back.
No...
It's an amazing place.
Those tourists get conned posing there,
that's not the real Guna cave.
See, the real thing is down the hill.
-We should go see then.
-Yes.
It's dangerous though.
We must go if it is dangerous.
Those forest guards are
quite unfriendly. Let's leave.
Hey, look at those people there.
Look at that.
Three of them!
If they can go, we can too.
Let's elevate the mood, bro.
No. No, guys. Forest guards
will create trouble. Leave it.
Kuttan, let's check it out please.
Hey, Kuttan. what's this, man.
What a boring gang Manjummel boys be,
if we don't go in there.
Kamal Haasan had a blast here,
it must be safe for sure. Let's go please.
See...
-Hey look at him!
-Let's go.
Hey Abhilash...
He went in. Come on!
Dude, don't go there as a group.
Forest guards are there.
[In Tamil] It's spectacular.
Don't miss it.
He is saying it's spectacular!
Step down carefully.
Dude, check out the view from here!
Subhash, don't hang on to it.
-Hey, got it. That's the one.
-Where?
Go real slow. Careful.
The real Guna Caves is down there.
It's a very beautiful place.
Hey, let's go down.
Guys, let's go down.
I'll show you something.
Further down?
There's some surprise
further down. Come.
Careful!
Subhash, come...
Mind your head, man.
Hey, look at that.
Dude, what is that?
What the hell is this place?
See, a pit.
Careful, there is a pit.
Come fast.
My goodness!
The other end of this must be Dubai.
Come up. Come up.
-Come, see this.
-Can we go down?
Is it there?
Let's get down. Come.
We should go too.
Climb down.
Jump. Fast!
This is Guna.
Agreed. Now go down.
Aren't you guys going down?
You get down from there, then.
Climb down.
One by one.
-Let's go back.
-Kuttan, coming?
Mind your step.
Use your fence crossing skills.
Where is Abhirami, man?
-My God!
-Come on.
Wait, man.
Wow! Is this what you told us about?
-Yes.
-Unbelievable!
Hey, look there.
-Is this where the song was shot?
-Not there, it's here.
"This isn't human love
that humans can make sense of."
"It's much beyond.
A sacred one."
Stay away from the slope.
See that?
Fort Kochi boys were here.
-When did these guys come here?
-See what they've written. In 1995.
Now we can't say that only we've
visited this spot from there.
-Man!
-Don't make a mess.
Leave it.
That's where bats piss.
-Don't you show off!
-What are you doing?
Let's erase it.
-Let me try.
-I didn’t ask you to clean it.
Bat piss reminds me, we could have
had a drink if we had brought the bottle.
-What's the point in saying that now?
-You only forgot it.
Guys, come here.
Check this out.
Don't call him.
He is such a nuisance.
This must be what,
a 100 feet deep?
A hundred? If you fall through this,
you'll reach Palani, at the minimum.
Ah, the real Malayali.
See, I got some paint.
-Can we write our club's name here?
-What? Darshana?
-What if we change the club's name again?
-Then write 'Manjummel Boys'.
That's awesome!
We'll write right away.
Guys, we're gonna write
'Manjummel Boys' over here.
Pass me that stick.
Pass me that jacket.
Get lost.
I want to take a photo.
Give it to me.
Hey, come.
Come, let's write 'Manjummel Boys' here.
Give it back to me, okay?
It's cold here.
Come, I'll show another spot.
There is a rotten smell here.
That's bat piss, man.
Caves have such a smell.
-Sudhi, this guy is handsome.
-What's that?
It's the skull of a monkey, throw it.
We saw them up there.
This one must be one of their cousins.
It must be around here,
leave it. Let's go.
Throw it. The monkey's ghost
will haunt you.
See that rock?
It's stuck in life.
That's the way monkeys go for tea.
-Amazing cave knowledge you have.
-Look at the bats. I told you.
Feeling cold after turning sober.
Dude, why don’t we take a photo from here
and hang it in front of our Club?
-Great idea!
-Right?
Come up, guys!
See!
-How is it?
-Superb.
Manjummel Boys in yellow colour!
Yo Manjummel Boys!
Yeah, boys. Come up!
Come on, everybody.
Let's take a picture.
Come up. We will take
a picture for memory.
Hey, come forward.
-Come, come man.
-Coming. Hey, Jinson...
Is this what you said?
Hey, write the year also, 2006.
Let me come there.
What happened, man?
What happened?
What?
Eh?
Subhash!
Subhash?
What is it, man?
Subhash, hey!
-What just happened, bro?
-Come up, all!
What is it? Eh?
He is not responding.
-Call again!
-Subhash!
He may be pranking us.
-Subhash!
-Is he tricking us?
Subhash!
Dude Subhash, don't play such pranks.
Stop it Subhash, just come out.
-What happened?
-Subhash fell into this pit...
What? Into the pit?
Dude, what exactly happened?
What? Fell into this?
Cannot hear any sound from him.
Subhash!
What are we waiting for, let's get down.
How do we go in?
It's pitch dark.
Subhash!
Let's flash the camera.
Switch it on!
Can you see?
No...
-Lower it further and try.
-Can't see a damn thing.
-Switch it on, I say!
-Give it time.
-Did anyone see anything?
-No. I can't see anything man.
Flash it again.
-I can't.
-Just press it!
-Try it again!
-See all around.
What's this? Nothing can be seen.
Do it again.
What the hell is this, dude?
Press the damn switch.
-Go in, further.
-Go down and take it.
This doesn't seem shallow.
Hey, Subhash!
Subhash!
Hey!
Subhash!
Hey...
Subhash!
Subhash, talk to us.
Can you hear us?
Damn... Call him again.
Subhash!
Make some noise...please.
Subhash is gone...
Subhash left us.
Subhash is gone.
He is gone.
Subhash has left us.
Siju...
We've lost him.
-What the hell is he saying?
-What's it Abhilash?
He has left us, man.
No, it's not like that.
Stop. Don't say that.
Stop it.
Abhilash, what are you doing?
-Take him away, man.
-We've lost him, dude!
Subhash...
Come here...
Leave me, man!
Bro, my friend... there...
-Please go and check, bro.
-Come... quick.
Come with me, Abhilash.
Walk!
Subhash, please respond man!
[In Tamil] Hey, why are you screaming?
Our friend fell into the pit, bro.
Please help us.
Our friend... he fell into this.
He is inside.
Please call someone.
Brother, please call somebody.
Please help us.
I can't do anything,
It's Satan's decision.
-You guys leave fast. It's big trouble.
-What are you saying?
Call someone, brother!
You don't know the seriousness.
Leave, this will be an issue.
We are not leaving.
Hey, go get somebody.
We will stay here.
-Don't get me wrong...
-Guys, hurry!
Why are you waiting?
Go get someone. Fast.
Hurry up!
Run!
Subhash, dude!
Subhash!
Calm down, man!
Any luck, guys?
-Brother, please come.
-Calm down and tell what it is.
-Our friend fell into a pit.
-Pit?
Ya, in the cave.
-Tell me clearly, the cave near that stone?
-Yes yes.
What have you done...
who asked you to go there?
Bro, please help us.
God! Okay, don't panic now.
I saw Guard Velayutham
going that way just now.
Find him, go fast.
Anil, come!
What's happening?
-We'll go get the guard.
-Check the parking lot too.
Sit there, you!
They will come here now.
-I want to see him.
-They have gone to seek help.
Subhash has gone...
Subhash has gone...
Subhash has gone...
Subhash has gone...
Guard!
-Forest guard...
-Where is he?
Forest guard?
-Come... come... tea, coffee...
-Brother!
-Please call the forest guard.
-[In Tamil] What happened?
Where is the forest guard?
Please call him, brother.
-Subhash fell in the pit.
-Who is Subhash? What pit?
Brother, Subhash is our friend.
He fell into a pit inside the cave.
Please call the forest
guard. Please help...
What? That hole?
Don't roam around here asking for help.
You go back to your place.
Go, leave.
Please, brother.
Please don't say that.
Leave!
[In Tamil] Dad, why are you
scaring these kids?
Go see if you can help in some way.
You grew up outside,
you don't know anything.
You know nothing about that pit.
We cannot help in any way.
-Brother, please don't say that...
-You should go back.
You should leave the place immediately.
Please don't say that. There is
nobody to help, we beg you...
We have nobody to help us...
Please brother.
Please help us save him.
What are you waiting for? Go to
the town and bring the police, fast!
Don't involve the police.
If the police comes,
they will make this a big issue.
Dad, you keep quiet.
-You go, get the police, quick!
-Let's go.
Call Prasad, let's go.
Please help us brother,
he is still in that pit.
Please brother, for God's sake...
Wait, I'll come.
Sister, please tell him.
Please go, Dad.
Shut up. Enough.
Hold this. Don't be afraid
even if you see ghosts.
Come, brother.
Yeah, let's go.
Vehicle is here!
Prasad! Prasad! Prasad!
Prasad, dude!
-What?
-Subhash fell into a pit.
-He must be playing some joke.
-You take the vehicle right now!
-We've no time. Quick!
-Where to?
Let's go to the police station!
Start the car.
Anil, what's happening?
They have gone to get the police.
What are you doing here?
-I am looking after him.
-You come with me.
Please don't go, don't move.
Stay here only, okay?
Don't go anywhere.
Brother, that...
It's that pit... there.
Subhash...
Dude...
Subhash!
Any response?
Where are they?
They have gone to get the police.
Any luck?
What's happening?
Subhash!
-Subhash...
-Hey!
Hey, move.
Move from there.
Move away from there.
Come this side. Move.
You have no idea how
dangerous this spot is.
Everybody move!
Give this to everyone.
-What is this for?
-I will tell you.
This place is not what
you think of it to be.
I will tell you,
give this to everyone.
Stop here. Right here. Come!
Dude, come.
Sir, isn't this the police station?
Yes, go in.
[In Tamil] New government has taken over.
I don't know what will happen.
Sir, sir...
What is it?
Sir.. Sir..
Our friend fell into a pit.
Sir, sir...
Please Sir.
Sir, our friend fell into a pit.
Who are you guys?
Our friend fell into a pit, Sir.
Hey, who let these guys inside?
They've dirtied the station floor.
-Our friend fell into a pit.
-Guys, come here.
All of you come here.
Sir, please help.
One of you tell me what's the matter.
Sir, please come. We're in trouble.
Oh, you are Malayalis?
What's the issue? Did you
drink and get into fight?
No sir, nothing like that.
Our friend fell into a pit,
please come with us.
Why don't you pull
him out of the pit?
Why have you come here?
Where is this pit?
Sir, the one in Guna cave...
What, did you say Guna cave?
Yes sir...
Ramaiah!
Heard this? He went down
the Guna cave, it seems.
-Ask once again.
-A pit inside the Guna cave?
Don't you know Guna cave
is a restricted area?
Why the hell did you go there?
Don't hit them. First, you go
and inform the inspector.
Sorry, sir.
Damn, such troubles land only here.
Why did you go there, guys?
Didn't you see the board
that says you can't go there?
See what happened? Your friend went
to a place from where he cannot return.
He has not left us, will
you please come, sir?
I will fall on you feet...
No use falling on my feet...
Your friend will not make it.
Nobody can bring him back.
Do you know the original
name of that spot?
Devil's kitchen.
Where Satan prepares his food.
Foreigners named it.
Will they name it so
without a reason?
After Kamal sir shot his film here...
...the name changed to Guna cave.
Post independence, 13 people
have fallen into it, as per records.
Nobody has made it
back from there alive.
Even their dead bodies
could not be retrieved.
It is at least 900 feet deep.
Some say...
The depth is as much as
the height of Kodaikanal hills.
It's a dangerous dark hole
with no light or air inside.
A central minister's nephew was
the last victim to fall there.
10 years back. All the forces
were brought in to rescue him.
I was also on duty that day.
They offered 15 Lakhs to retrieve even
a piece of his bones to do the rituals.
15 lakhs in those days
was a huge amount.
There are people here
who will do anything for money.
But nobody came forward.
Why?
They knew that life was
more valuable than money.
A central minister could not do anything...
...you are just regular
tourists from Kerala.
What can you pull off?
Please sir, please come and help us.
We have nobody...
-Arguing with the police? How dare you!
-Sir, please don't beat us.
-This is a bloody police station.
-Sir, please don't beat us.
Sir, we have not done anything...
Not a word more.
I'll lynch you if you talk.
Sir, why are you torturing us?
What?
Giving orders to the police?
We've dealt with so many like you.
After bringing him here
and murdering him...
...now complaining to police
as if you know nothing!
-Why are you saying so?
-Shut your mouth.
-Shut up and sit.
-Sir, please!
Shut up. If you open your mouth...
Man, tell him to stop.
-Hey, Ramaiah!
-Sir!
File an FIR on all four of them.
Let me see how they go back home.
60...61...62...63...
...64...65...67...68...
[Counting continues]
90...91...92...93...
Go hide behind those bricks.
96...97...98...90...100!
Hey, I'm coming to you.
I'm done counting!
Here I come, okay?
-Jinson, gotcha!
-Shucks!
Who's that? Anil?
-Hey Anil, gotcha!
-Yaay!
Here! Gotcha!
Hey there! Come, you're caught.
Found Subhash?
No, only he is left.
Gotcha!
Eh? Where did he vanish?
Subhash! Subhash!
Subhash, where are you?
Subhash!
Subhash!
Subhash!
Dude, where are you?
Dude, enough of this prank.
Now come out. Subhash!
Okay, you've won the game.
Now come!
Okay, we lost.
Come out, man!
Subhash dude... enough of hiding!
Subhash, show up now.
Brother...
We've been searching for you.
Why did you search for me
in this downpour?
Someone fell into the Guna Cave.
A Kerala guy.
You're eating peacefully here
without any clue about it.
-What the hell are you saying?
-You loser!
Damn! I'll lose my job!
Can't even eat peacefully.
Boys have gone to the police station.
What? To the police?
Oh GodI If it rains like this,
water will fill the pit...
Hey brother, where are you going?
Don't fall into that pit, man.
Dude...
Brother, what are you trying to do?
You might slip and fall down.
Hey, you..!
Hold this, man.
Subhash, hey!
Dude, at least you advise him!
Tell him, please!
Dude, careful.
Nothing bad should happen to you.
Hey brother, come here please!
Come on.
Tell him to come up, brother.
Kuttan, too much water
is flowing in from all around.
Brother, what are you trying to do?
Come up, man.
What are you staring at?
Go and help him!
You and your damn hygiene!
Come!
What the hell, guys?
What the hell are you doing?
You can stop the flow like that?
Subhash...
Hey! Hey! Who allowed you here?
Hey, you! What are you doing here?
Leave. Get out of here.
I'm telling you. Leave!
Velayudha, hey!
-Who the hell are you? Get out.
-Hey, Velayudha...
Hey! What are you both doing?
I lost my friend. Who are you?
I will wait right here!
Just shut up.
Hey, can't you understand?
Get out of here!
-Arumugham, what are you doing here?
-Wait, I'll tell you.
What's this, bro?
You'll get me out of my job!
One of these boys
fell into this hole, bro.
To inform... Someone has gone
to inform the police.
If we stop the rainwater flow,
they will take care of the rest.
You're a local, right? Why are you
talking as if you don't know?
Do you think a man who fell inside
this hole will still be alive?
To the dead, does it make a difference
if the water flows in or not?
-Don't talk like that, bro.
-Shut up. My job is on the line.
Subhash!
Subhash!
Hey, get up. What's this?
Dude... Subhash!
Why don't you listen?
Stop this, all of you!
Guys, stay calm. Come up.
Have patience. Don't panic.
Let the police come. Wait!
[In Tamil] Bro, inspector is calling you.
Damn. Won't even let me eat!
-Sir!
-Listen, Kathiresan...
Take all these guys to the spot
and find out what happened there.
Okay, Sir.
Hey, don't go empty handed.
Buy a rope, torchlight and all.
Sure, Sir.
Media has got to know
about it already.
As if we don't have
enough troubles already...
These insane idiots are
out to destroy us.
Why the hell did you go there?
Look at them! My fate!
Hey, kick them out!
Hey, you expect a grand welcome?
Get your asses up and come.
Kathiresan, boys are already beaten up
and scared. Take them carefully.
Why? Where was this fear when
showing bravado in the damn gorge?
Don't know what shit
I'm going to do in this rain.
Come, you...
Hey, go that liquor shop and buy
two quarters, water, glass and cigarettes.
Don't forget to get a matchbox.
Eh?
Matchbox, man!
[In Malayalam] Understood?
Dude, go fast.
What are you discussing?
Go and get the things fast.
So naive you are.
Sir, shouldn't we buy a rope too?
Rope and all we’ll buy
on the way if we find.
Give me a pint, bro.
[In Tamil] Hey, stop pushing.
It's urgent.
Let me buy a half bottle.
Yeah, we too are in a hurry.
Bro, we don't have much time.
-Why did you push me?
-You want a fight?
-Hey, you!
-Dude, what's it?
If you are a visitor,
just roam around and leave.
Don't raise your voice.
Bro, you stay out of this.
They are outsiders.
Why do you support them?
You guys leave.
It's trouble.
Subhash, come on! Jump!
Come on, man. Jump in!
Subhash, come on. Do it.
Hey...
Drive slow.
What kind of a man are you, sir?
You know how long it's been
since he fell into the cave?
You're doing this when we are
worried what happened to him.
Oh! So you are getting angry?
It's not anger, sir.
Just disappointed and sad that
we aren't able to do anything.
You don't have to do anything.
Let me tell you based on my
years of experience here...
...your friend won't survive.
Guna cave has no record like that.
Got it?
Brother, why is the police
coming so late?
Have they ever come on time?
They would've never come to this place.
Seeing them here in itself is a big deal.
You guys run!
I will come.
Run fast!
Sir, can you go there fast?
I can't do this according to your urgency.
Am I a small boy?
Age is catching up, right?
What's up, Kumara?
One more gone?
Yeah, sir. A boy fell into it again.
Yeah, man. They come here
to ruin your business.
Hey, close the shop.
Lock everything in real quick.
Let's leave.
Dude, what's happening?
What is it?
What happened, guys?
Cops thrashed us real bad.
They said we pushed him
down to kill him.
Where are the cops?
Coming with Prasad.
What Sir? Now too?
Careful.
-Wait, man.
-Understand the situation, Sir.
Come on, Sir. Slowly.
Careful, Sir.
-Watch your step. It's slippery.
-Give a hand.
Hey Dominic, did you bring
these boys in here?
Sir, don't I know this is a restricted area?
Don't blame me, sir. I'll never do it.
-Yeah, I know you follow rules!
-I never come here, Sir.
I don't take such risks.
Sir, watch your step.
You might fall down.
Sir, come here.
See here, sir.
Got a flashlight, guys?
Hey, what's his name?
Subhash!
Subhash! Subhash!
Dude...
When did it happen?
It has been long.
No chance of him remaining alive.
Sir, please don't say that.
Where were you man?
Sir, I had gone to eat.
This happened all of a sudden.
Is that an excuse? You're going to
lose your job. Just wait.
Sir...
Hey, take your vehicle.
-Get up, you can't be here. Go.
-Sir, please save him!
Please call someone, sir.
-Sir, please help us somehow.
-Get up, you! Get up. Enough.
Get up, I say... Hey, start the vehicle!
Go to the vehicle.
Sir, I won't start the vehicle.
Won't you do it?
Why did you slap him, sir?
You have no right.
If you don't take the vehicle now,
it will never go out of Kodaikanal.
Even if you say you'll burn
all of us here, I won't.
How dare you argue with me?
Sir, please don't.
Dominic, don't interfere.
You know me well, right?
I will trap you in mushroom case.
Hey, Kathiresan... Why do you
rush into decisions like that?
This is a murder case. You will have to
make rounds of police station and court.
Man, the rain will stop in a few minutes.
We can do something with these guys.
Don't we have a duty to protect
the people who come to our place?
Sir, please show mercy on us.
See what you've done.
I'll make you pay for it.
Please, sir. I'm innocent in this.
Sir, let's try something.
Sir, please help!
Subhash!
Hey Subhash!
Subhash!
Dude!
Hey
How long should I wait here like this?
Rain has stopped.
No use sitting here.
Arumugham, you tell them.
What do you want me to tell?
Brother, you look like the eldest
of the lot. Make them understand.
If we go to the station now,
we can at least inform the family.
Sir, what will we tell his family?
How can we return home without him?
What will I tell his mother?
Hey Dominic, you know
this place very well.
Falling into it is like dropping
cash into a temple vault.
It's his fate, he is gone.
What can we do?
Bro, whatever sir says is true.
Let's go up and discuss what to do.
Are you telling us to
leave him here and go?
Hey Velayudham, let's drag them out.
Bro, you get up.
Listen to me. Get up.
Come, get up.
Listen to me. Come on.
Listen to me. Get up.
All of you listen to me!
-Subhash!
-Hey, pull him. Get up, man.
Subhash!
Hey, Subhash!
Subhash..!
Dude, Subhash..!
Sixon, is it you?
Krishnakumar!
Guys!
Kuttan!
Hey!
Hey..!
Subhash..!
Hey!
Dude, Subhash!
Hey!
Subhash..! Subhash..!
Dude.. are you there? Subhash!
Dude!
Subhash, are you there?
What? What did you hear, man?
Subhash, hey!
Sir, we heard him.
-Subhash!
-Hey, quiet!
Now you call him.
Hey Subhash, can you hear us? Hey!
Hey..!
Sir...
Yes! We can hear him, bro.
He is talking.
Dude, we all are here.
Sir, see. We can hear him.
Don't worry, man!
Don't worry. Police is also here!
Stay calm. Don't panic.
Look there!
They are here.
Fire force is here. Come!
Give way.
Towards that side, please.
-Sir!
-Yeah.
Can we get a blueprint of this cave?
What? Blueprint?
Sir, this is a very dangerous spot.
If you can give it, it will be useful.
How will you get the blueprint of a place
where nobody has gone or returned from?
Sorry, sir.
Don't do any shit.
Why did he go inside knowing that
it's a prohibited area? To die?
Don't take risks.
If there are formalities,
do only that.
-I'll take care of the rest.
-OK, Sir.
Sir, come. Come fast.
Fast Fast!
Brother, can you see a gap
to put the ropes?
Brother, can you hear us?
Grab the rope if you see it.
Hey, Thomas... Do you see his face?
How many feet down he is?
Sir, we cannot estimate the distance
due to his voice echoing inside the cave.
Move aside.
Yeah, keep it that way.
Hey!
Can you hear?
Like hell he can.
Drop the rope further down.
Walk slowly, dammit.
Don't fall into it.
Is there a feast happening here?
Why did you make them sit like this?
Send them up.
They wouldn't listen, sir.
Locals are also sympathetic to them.
Aren't you a cop?
Yes, sir.
Salutes, Sir!
-Are you the guard?
-Yes, Sir.
What the hell were you doing?
Sir, I took a break to eat.
Sir, greetings. These bloody tourists
come here and suck the life out of us.
As if our regular problems
are not enough.
Didn't see you at
the club for two days.
They sent my transfer order.
I was running around in that stress.
Bro!
Bro, can you see the rope?
Siju, I don't think this will work.
We are losing time.
Tell them to go down and search.
Hey, brother...
Can you hear us, bro?
He is saying something.
Are they trying to fish with the rope?
Come here.
Hey!
-Let me talk.
-Yes, send him.
-What is it?
-Sir, nothing much. He is alive.
You've played with the rope enough.
What if is unable to hold the rope?
Someone must go down the rope.
We are trying, right?
-Who the hell are you, man?
-I'm his friend.
-Wait, sir.
-Shut up and sit down.
-Sir.
-Yeah, what?
What he says makes sense.
No use putting that rope into the cave.
It's not a straight path.
It has many twists and turns.
Sir, please understand.
Please.
It's chilling cold down there.
He can't stay long. He might die.
Yeah, now give us tips!
Did you do your duty properly?
No, sir. Three departments are working
hard here and he is telling us what to do.
Are we fooling around here?
-Hey Thomas...
-Sir!
Come here.
Sir!
Hey, what we are doing is of no use.
Arrange a person who can go down.
You were the one
who told me earlier..?
Yeah, it's me telling you to do it.
Make arrangements to go down.
Hurry up!
Everything will be done well.
Sit quietly.
Take them aside.
You OK?
No, Sir.
What's wrong?
I can't do it, sir.
Hey, I can't believe you saying it.
Sir, don't you know
how dangerous it is?
Don't worry. I'm with you.
You've got a rare opportunity.
Make use of it.
It will make your service record
shine in the future.
Whatever you say, I can't do it.
-Thomas...
-Sir!
Come here.
What is the confusion there?
Sir, the boys are scared
to go into the hole.
The whole world knows now
that the guy down there is alive.
Make an effort to do something.
Sir, you please keep quiet.
Thomas, if your boys can't do it,
why don't you make a local guy do it?
-Sir...
-What is it?
Sir, no local will do it.
There is a guy who has picked up at least
50 dead bodies from the suicide point.
Even he is scared to come here.
Stop these excuses.
Hey, why are you guys afraid?
Can't any of you go down?
Can't you do it?
Sir, why are you
asking me like this?
Government won't even give a
death certificate if I die down there.
My wife and kids will
end up in the street.
Yeah, I won this.
Yeah, right. Now shut up.
Dude, where is Kannan?
What?
He was swimming with us.
-Swimming behind Anil.
-He was with us...
Get lost, you!
Hey, Kannan!
Sir!
Stop. You can't go there.
Leave him. What now?
I'll go down, sir.
Didn't I tell you to stay there?
I'll call you if needed. Go.
I can't stay away, sir. You've been
talking all this while with no action.
We will do it if you can't.
Do you understand Tamil?
One minute. Bro, what is your name?
Kuttan.
Kuttan, don't take any
emotional decisions. Okay?
One man is already fighting for his life.
We don't want to take a risk
by sending you too down there, okay?
What bigger risk is there, sir?
All of us will jump into it if you say no.
Hey, do you think you are a hero?
Even the trained guys are scared to go.
The guy who picks up bodies from
the suicide point too is scared.
And you are saying you will?
Why are you scaring him?
None among you came forward.
Saving a life is just a job for you.
For him, it's beyond that.
Bro, we're concerned about his life.
Bro, are you saying this knowing the risks?
Know that you are putting life in danger.
Dude, going down is a huge risk.
Are you sure about this?
If it was you, what will you do?
If you don't go in, I will.
Sir...
Watch carefully.
See how I tie it with both my hands.
Now I join both and make a knot like this.
This side is for the waist
and the other side is for the chest.
Understood?
They're telling you to tie him
like this when you see him.
Did you understand?
I don't understand anything, bro.
Let me reach him first.
I'll think about it then.
Are you ready?
Shall we start?
Yeah, ready!
Hold the rope.
Go back a bit.
Close...
Move. Go.
Move back.
Bro, stand right here.
Translate to him what I say.
The last one holding the rope
go further back.
Hold on to it tightly.
Are you OK?
Don't worry.
Boys, hold the rope tightly.
Thomas, tell all of them
to hold it strong.
Brother, are you ready?
-Boys, are you ready?
-Ready, sir.
Raise it a little bit.
Lift it up slowly.
Take it up a little more. Up, up...
Up...up... OK...
Yes, stop.
Be ready.
Slowly bring it down.
A bit slower. Drop it slowly.
Real slow...
Slow... Release it down.
A bit more slower.
Boys, loosen it a bit.
Yeah.
Steadily.
Drop it real slow like that.
A bit more.
Slowly.
Have patience.
Yes. Steadily.
Yeah, OK.
Subhash! Subhash!
-Loosen it.
-Release it. Yes.
Subhash!
Hey, stop.. stop...
Stop!
Bro, do you see anything?
Are you okay?
What?
Subhash!
Bro, come here.
Translate to him what I tell you.
Kuttan!
You're OK, right?
Can you see anything?
It's dark here.
It's too slippery.
Bro, what is he saying?
It's slippery there. He tells you
to loosen up the rope a bit.
Tell him to come up
if he has any problem.
Hey, are you alright?
Should I tell them to loosen the rope?
So much slush.
It's slippery.
Drop me real slow.
Okay, dude.
Sir, loosen the rope...
Bro, I'll tell them to
release slowly, okay?
Yeah.
Subhash!
Okay, drop the rope.
Yes, down.
Drop it down.
Down... Down.
Slowly.
Slowly.
Drop it further.
Do it slowly.
What is it, man?
Eh?
Down.
Yes.
Drop me.
Subhash!
Kuttan!
Can you see anything?
It's slippery.
Lower real slow.
-Sir, tell them to slow down.
-Please stop it.
Are you fine?
Tell me dude. Are you fine?
Kuttan!
Kuttan!
Dude, can you see anything?
Stop.
-Sir, stop.
-Stop!
Kuttan...
Did you see him?
I can't see anything.
He must be further down.
Not sure where his voice is coming from.
Loosen the rope slowly.
Drop it slow.
Down.
Slowly. Down.
Down...
Yes, that's good.
Lower it slowly.
Yes, like that.
Is this OK?
Kuttan, is this OK?
What's wrong?
Hey!
Dude, ask him if he is fine.
He doesn't seem to be in his senses.
He is blabbering something.
I can't make sense of it.
His is blabbering something.
Hey!
Can you hear anything?
I can't understand anything.
Hey, can you see this light?
Subhash!
Man...
Drop it, man.
Yeah, slowly... Yes.
Drop it real slow... Yes.
Yeah, that's right. Drop it like that.
Subhash...!
Loosen the rope, guys.
Sir, we ran out of rope!
Drop it further, guys!
What happened?
Sir, we are out of rope.
Send one of your guys to the vehicle
and bring some more ropes.
-That's not the problem.
-Then?
That rope was 120 feet long.
He is so deep down.
Chances are that oxygen level is too low.
It's too risky to go lower than that.
Kuttan..!
We have a problem.
What is it?
The rope is over.
Get some more rope, man!
They are saying we can't
send you further down.
Why is that?
Dude, you can't breathe.
Dude...
I can hear him clearly from here, man.
How can I come back
after reaching here?
Loosen it up, dude.
Sir...
Hey!
Don't you understand?
Come up, I say!
Anyway, we are going to lift you up.
Sir... Sir...
Sir, please help.
Don't pull him now.
Don't pull him up, Sir.
Please....
Keep me here... hey!
If you raise me,
I'll untie this rope.
Subhash is talking, Sir.
I can hear him very well!
Hey!
Are you a fool?
Brother, don't worry.
With God's grace, it rained
and water has gone in.
Have faith.
Don't lose hope.
Senapathi, ready?
Sir, ready..!
Release it patiently.
Yes, like that. Slow.
Bit more slowly.
Drop it.
Hold on.
Hey!
Subhash!
Dude...
What happened?
Hey, Subhash...
Dude...
Subhash!
Hey!
What is it?
Dude... Subhash!
I saw him!
I saw him, man!
What?
Hey, I saw him!
I can see him now!
Subhash!
-Guys, he has seen Subhash!
-What?
What?
Calm down. Have patience.
Let's hear what he says.
Ask if he is OK.
Keep calm.
Let them do their work.
We got him, right?
Now calm down.
Dude, ask if he is alright.
Move back please.
Hey, Subhash!
Drop me down, guys!
Subhash!
Hey, stop.
Dude, is he okay?
He is soaked in blood, man.
Ask if he can come up on the rope.
Hey, can he hold the rope and come up?
Subhash, dude!
No, he can't.
We can only tie and pull him up.
No, sir.
Brother, I had told him
how to tie the rope.
Ask him if he remembers.
Bro, do you remember the knot
they had taught you?
What?
Man...
No...
Shit...
Man, I can't recollect.
It's alright, bro.
We're going home.
Dude...
Hold on.
Let him tell after he ties the rope.
We will slowly pull him up. Okay?
Dude, tell us after you tie him.
We will pull you guys up.
It's alright.
Bro, pull you up.
Come, Subhash...
Subhash...
Who...Who are you?
You'll die...
Who the hell are you?
No..!
Come on, pull!
Hold him. Hold the rope.
Kuttan..!
Kuttan..!
I can't hear anything, sir.
Kutta... Hey Kutta!
Can you be quiet?
Hey, all of you keep quiet.
He can't hear.
Kutta...
Hey, Kuttan..!
Subhash!
Hold my hand...
Bro, hold my hand.
Kuttan...
Hey!
Kutta, are you OK?
Lift me.
He responded, man.
Sudhi, can we pull?
Shall we pull?
Yeah, pull me up.
Yeah, pull!
Pull!
Pull up.. Hurry!
Come on! Pull!
Pull them up steadily.
-Pull up slowly...slow.
-Come on, pull!
Stop... Stop!
Wait. Stop.
Yeah, pull now.
Pull now.
Pull...
Yes, more.
Kuttan...
Guys...
Pull steadily.
Grab it...
We are unable to pull.
Kuttan..!
Dude, what happened?
Why isn't it moving?
Bro, we are stuck here.
You won't able to pull us up.
He says he is stuck there.
Pull real hard now. Ready?
One...two...three!
Ask him what's happening.
Hey, what's wrong?
What happened, man?
No space here.
I don't think we both
can come up together.
Guys, we are stuck here...
Trapped.
Pull it stronger, dudes.
Pull it harder.
One...Two...Three!
Pull... pull...
Once more!
We are badly stuck, man.
Kuttan, see if you can do something.
Shake the rope a bit and see...
Hey, Abhilash!
Move away.
This is no joke.
Dude, move away from the edge.
We'll bring Subhash to you.
Don't create trouble. Move away!
Move aside, man.
Hey, who are you?
Move away!
Move!
Guys, loosen it!
Kuttan, should we loosen the rope?
What?
Yes! Do it!
Loosen!
Hold it. Hold it.
Ready? Go.. go...

Master...
I haven't eaten anything
since afternoon.
You think I did?
Kathiresan, what is your plan?
You know the drill. We've to take him
to the station for the formalities.
Sir, we will see the procedures later.
He is badly injured. Instead of giving him
medical aid, discussing the formalities?
Sir, his body is soaked in blood.
Sir, what should we do?
Take him to the hospital.
Pass that solution.
Hold his hands.
It's done...
Hold on for a second.
Just two minutes.
Doctor...
Come in please.
-Take a seat.
-No, doctor. It's OK.
Your friend's injuries are severe.
He needs trauma care.
But we don't have such facilities here.
Take him to a bigger hospital in Madurai.
Or why don't you take him
to your home town?
But doctor... Police?
Police is here just to extract money.
The case comes under
the forest department, right?
Okay... District Forest Officer
is an acquaintance.
Let me talk to him and try.
Okay, Doctor.
-Madam, can you explain what happened?
-No time for all that. It's an emergency.
Madam, can't you treat him here?
We don't have
the needed facilities here.
So they are leaving.
Please don't disturb.
Hey, send all of them out.
-Sir.. Sir...
-Yeah, leave.
Siju David Sir,
tell us about...
...your experience saving
your friend's life in that cave?
Let us get back home. Please.
Sir, please...
Let's go.
Sir, please... Sir..
Hey, you...
If I see you guys on tour
somewhere here again...
I'll finish you off.
Okay, sir. Thank you.
Go!
Subhash, eat this.
No.
Eat, buddy.
-Eat something, bro.
-No, I don't want.
[News on TV]...in a tragic incident,
one of them fell into a pit in a restricted area..
The place locals call the darkest valley...
Their friend who that fell
over 900 square feet down...
...when the police and rescue teams
stood helpless...
...his good friend daringly saved him
without caring for his own life.
DISTRICT HOSPITAL
ALUVA
Get a stretcher.
Dude, we'll go together.
Where is he going?
Hey, Abhilash!
Careful. Hold his head straight.
You guys are back?
What happened, son?
Where's all that excitement?
That... Our Subhash had some trouble.
Why? Did police catch him?
No, he skid and fell in the waterfall.
In the waterfall?
Were you guys sloshed?
Where is he now?
He is in the hospital.
What the hell is this?
If something had happened to him
at the waterfall, who do I have?
What did you promise me
when you took him with you?
That you will take care of him, right?
Haven't you grown old enough?
Why don't you marry a girl
and settle down?
Why do you spoil these boys?
To hell with your friendship!
Dude, Anil... I didn't mean
what I said earlier, okay?
That's okay, man.
Hey, Prasad...
No, buddy. I don't want any money.
Keep this, man.
Don't you have to pay the company?
-No, it's OK. Really.
-Still, keep the money.
We came back in one piece.
What more do we need?
You go home. We will call you
when we need any help.
See you.
We are really busy.
It will take a week.
-Take your time.
-Hmm.
Mother...!
What happened, Subhash?
Unable to sleep?
Subhash, why are you so quiet?
Can't close my eyes at all.
Okay, let us try it once.
Close both the eyes.
Siju's daring rescue of his friend
from Devil's Kitchen...
is a noble act that
we should not treat as trivial.
This is not a story that should be
kept within the small town of Manjummel.
We must immediately inform this
to all the media.
During the next Sunday mass, I'll gather
everyone in our parish and announce this.
Look... He is the one.
He is Kuttan, right?
Looks like some serious trouble.
Did you do any mischief again?
Me? No way.
Then what is this?
