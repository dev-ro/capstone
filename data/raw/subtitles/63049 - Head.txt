beliefs and conditioning.
All belief possibly could be said
to be the result of some conditioning.
Thus, the study of history...
is simply the study
of one system of beliefs deposing another.
And so on and so on and so on.
A psychologically tested belief
of our time...
is that the central nervous system...
which feeds its impulses
directly to the brain -
the conscious and subconscious -
is unable to discern between the real...
and the vividly imagined experience.
If there is a difference -
and most of us believe there is -
Am I being clear?
For to examine these concepts requires
tremendous energy and discipline.
To allow the unknown
to occur and to occur...
requires clarity.

there is no choice...

of distinguishing between the real...

Sound and film of music and radio -
