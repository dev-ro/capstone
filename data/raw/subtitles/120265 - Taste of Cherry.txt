-Where are you going?
-To the barracks
Come on, get in
HeIIo
HeIIo
Are you weII?
Where are you going?
Down there, not very far
The barracks down there?
-Near the reservoir?
-Yes
You Iook tired
I guess I am
-Are you worn out?
-Yes
A soIdier is never tired!
What do you expect?
I've waIked from Darabad
-From Darabad?
-Yes
But today's a hoIiday
I'm on duty tonight
untiI six in the morning
Then what are you doing?
-Where wiII you go?
-To my aunt's
She's dead, I stay
with her husband, a janitor
How Iong ago were you drafted?
Two months
-StiII in training?
-Yes
Where are you from?
Kurdistan
-And you're in the army here?
-Yes
WiII you stay or go back after?
-No, I'II go back.
-Sorry?
-I'II go back home.
-Back to Kurdistan?
-Yes.
-Good
What did you do
in Kurdistan?
What did you do there?
I was a farmer
A farmer?
Have you studied?
-Were you at schooI?
-Not for Iong
WeII
You gave up?
Why?
You know how it is
How many peopIe in your famiIy?
Nine
-Nine?
-Yes
-They aII work?
-Yes, aII of them
-Do you know anyone in Tehran?
-Yes
-ReIatives?
-Yes
I have two brothers in Tehran
Why don't you stay with them?
They're married,
they have smaII houses, chiIdren
I can't stay there
Do you have money?
SoIdiers get pay
-Money?
-A IittIe... the pay's not good
Is it enough for you?
0h no, it's not enough
When do you have to be back by?
Six p.m.
It's five now
You're so fond of the pIace,
you get there
an hour earIy?
No, not reaIIy... no
We've got an hour to kiII.
How about a drive?
I may have
a weII-paid job to offer you
to suppIement your income
I want to be at the barracks
by six
-What?
-I want to be back by six
I'II drive you back
Don't worry, you won't be Iate
-ShaII we go?
-0kay
I'II get you back by six,
don't worry
You say the barracks
aren't much fun?
I had fun
when I did my miIitary service
It was the best time
of my Iife
I met my cIosest friends there
EspeciaIIy in the first
six months
I remember we used to get up
at four in the morning
After breakfast,
we'd shine our boots and
we'd go out on manoeuvers.
The major wouId join us
There were 40 to 45 men
in the regiment
The major wouId start counting
He'd teII us to repeat: 0ne
Two
Three
Four
Do you count too?
Is it the same?
WeII?
How do you count?
Are you shy?
-Yes.
-What?
Why? Don't you count with
your friends at the barracks?
Yes
So you don't think of me
as a friend
0f course I do, we're friends
No, you act as if
we don't know each other
-No, it's not that.
-WeII, then?
It's not that
Listen, this is how we did it:
0ne
Two
Three
Four
0ne, two, three, four
0ne, two, three, four
-Go on, repeat after me: 0ne
-0ne
two, three
Is that how you do it
at the barracks?!
-SoIdiers don't count Iike that!
-I can't heIp it
You're taking me a Iong way!
I need to know what you want
-What you have to do?
-Yes
You know, son
If I were in your shoes,
I wouIdn't ask
what the job is,
but rather how good the pay is
For someone Iike you
the pay's what matters.
A job is a job
It's easy
if you Iook at it that way
This isn't an ordinary job
but neither is the pay
In ten minutes,
you can earn six months' pay
What's the job?
Forget the job,
it's the pay that matters
You have to teII me what it is!
Listen, when you ask a Iaborer
to dig foundations
does he ask
if they're for a hospitaI,
a Iunatic asyIum or a mosque
or a schooI? He does his job
and gets his pay
Ever been a Iaborer?
Yes
Were you toId
what you were digging for?
-No, no one toId me.
-Why ask me then?
HeIp me out, I'II pay you
It's not hard, you'II see
0kay?
Where are you going?
I have to be at the barracks
by six
I'II drive you back,
wait a whiIe
I want to get out!
I want to get out!
-Get out?
-Yes
A caII of nature?
No, I was thinking
I couId go
Why did I ask you to come?
You think I'm nuts?
Do I Iook nuts?
I was thinking
I ought to get back
I promised I'd get you back
by six and I wiII
Wait a whiIe
Come on, get out a minute
-I need to get back.
-Get out, I'II expIain
You see that hoIe
That hoIe there
Now Iisten carefuIIy
At six in the morning,
come here and caII me twice:
''Mr. Badii! Mr. Badii!''
If I repIy, take my hand
to heIp me out of there
There's 200,000 tomans
in the car
Take it and go
If I don't repIy,
throw in 20 spadefuIs of earth
on top of me
-Then take the money and go.
-Take me back
Keep it. Take me back!
I don't want to cause troubIe
-TroubIe? What troubIe?
-I don't want it. It's Iate
I want to go back. I don't want
to be invoIved in aII this
You can't throw 20 spadefuIs
of earth in that hoIe?
Right now,
I reaIIy need you
otherwise I wouIdn't have
begged you
You want me to beg you?
Is that what you want?
No, why wouId you beg me?
What does ''need'' mean?
What does ''heIp'' mean?
''HeIp'' isn't necessariIy paid for,
but I'II give you money,
I'II heIp you
Don't you need money?
Are you sure?
0f course I do
WeII?
Isn't 200,000 enough?
It's not that.
I can't do this for you
It's not a matter of money
You can't throw earth in a hoIe?
Yes, but not on top of someone,
not on someone's head
You can't throw earth
on someone!
If he was aIive,
he'd stand up to respond.
Look, I reaIIy need your heIp.
I'm not mad!
When you throw the earth in,
the man won't be aIive,
or he wouIdn't be in that hoIe
Do you understand now?
Do you understand me?
Yes
So if you understand,
get out, come and see
When you come back here
at six tomorrow morning
Is your barracks over there?
From there to here
wiII onIy take you 20 minutes
CaII my name twice:
''Mr. Badii, Mr. Badii!''
If I repIy, you'II take my hand
to heIp me cIimb out
You'II get paid
But if I don't repIy...
Get out
Get out!
Get out, come and see!
It's God's wiII I shouId need you
and you don't want to heIp!
You don't want to?!
You won't bury me aIive!
Right now,
they're burying dozens of peopIe
As we speak, dozens
of dead peopIe are being buried
-You've never seen a gravedigger?
-No, never
I'm not a gravedigger
I don't bury peopIe
I know you're not a gravedigger
If I'd wanted one,
I'd have fetched one
It's you I need
You're Iike my son
HeIp me
I have to beg?
Is that what you want?
No, what's the use of begging?
Get out then,
come and have a Iook
Maybe you'II feeI up to it
20 spadefuIs of earth
Just 20,
Each paid 1 0,000 tomans
Where are you from?
-Kurdistan.
-You're a Kurd!
A Kurd has to be brave
You peopIe have fought
so many wars,
known such suffering...
Your viIIages have been decimated
You've probabIy used a gun,
right?
Know what a gun is?
Why you're given one?
So you can kiII when you need to
I don't want to give you
a gun to kiII me
I'm giving you a spade, a spade
You're a farmer, right?
Just pretend you're farming
and that I'm manure to be spread
at the foot of a tree
Is that hard?
You're destined to use a gun,
not a spade!
You can't even use a spade!
Thank you!
Thank you very much!
-HeIIo.
-HeIIo
-How are you?
-WeII, thanks
-What's that machine for?
-Making cement
ReaIIy?
Why isn't it working?
This pIace is cIosed now.
The workers aren't here
So what are you doing here?
I'm the security guard
-Are you aIone?
-Yes
AII aIone... Do you enjoy that?
Come and join me
-I don't want to disturb you.
-Come on up!
-I have to cIimb this Iadder?
-Yes
-How can you cIimb this?
-I'm used to it
-You're used to it.
-Yes
-HeIIo.
-HeIIo
What a nice pIace
Nice? It's nothing
but earth and dust
You don't think earth's nice?
Earth gives us
aII the good things!
So according to you, aII good
things return to the earth
I think you're...?
I'm Afghani
-Where from?
-Mazar-e Sharif
That's a strange name.
Whose ''Mazar'' is it?
It's the tomb of the Imam AIi
It's a pIace of piIgrimage
Isn't the Imam AIi's tomb
in Najaf?
Yes, but some peopIe think
it's in Mazar-e Sharif
Strange
What are you doing?
I'm making myseIf an omeIette.
It isn't worthy of you
I'II make you some tea
Thank you very much!
Don't you get bored here aIone?
I'm used to it.
I'm used to IoneIiness too
Do you know that man?
Yes, he's a feIIow countryman
He's Afghani?
Yes, he's a ''seminarist''.
He's here for his hoIidays
A ''seminarist''?
He shouId be in a seminary
He feIt IoneIy,
he came to see me
He's been here
for two or three nights
Is he staying for good?
0f course not...just three nights
I didn't catch what you said
-Is he staying tonight?
-Yes, he's staying
You're not entireIy aIone then
No, not entireIy aIone
-Is he Afghani too?
-Yes
So many Afghanis around here!
There've been a Iot
since the war in Afghanistan
Between 2 and 3 miIIion Afghanis
Iive in Iran
With the war here,
why didn't they go back?
The war against Iraq
onIy concerned the Iranians
But the war at home concerned us
And our war didn't concern you?
You couId say your war
troubIed us
but the Afghanistan War
was harder... more painfuI for us
TeII me
today's a hoIiday,
so why are you here aIone?
You feeI sad, so do I
Come for a drive. We can
get a change of scene, taIk
I'm the security guard here,
I'm in charge
-A guard in this pIace?
-Yes
But who couId carry off
a machine that heavy?
It's a hoIiday.
No one needs guards. Come on
Let's get some fresh air.
Everything's safe
It's my duty.
We aII have our responsibiIities
-I can't Ieave my post.
-You reaIIy can't?
No, sorry
I thought
we couId get some air
I'II go and see your friend,
the seminarist
Maybe we'II go
for a drive together
I've made some tea
Leave it for Iater.
Good-bye
-Try going the other way.
-The Iadder moves!
It's dangerous! Mend it
You can mend it
by wrapping fuse-wire around it
Are you weII?
You're Afghani, aren't you?
Yes
What are you doing?
I've got three days' hoIiday
I was aIone, I feIt down
My friend Ahmad was aIone too
so I came here to visit him
I meant
what are you doing in Iran?
I study at the Tchizar seminary
Aren't there any seminaries
in Afghanistan?
Yes, there are some.
But there was a war on
And my seminary wasn't
that good
so my father toId me
to study in Iran or at Najaf
So I came to study in Iran
What about the fees?
Does your father send you money?
My father isn't that weII-off, no
The seminary pays me 2,000 tomans
During the summer, I work
to buiId up my savings
What kind of work?
I work as a Iaborer,
simpIe work
I didn't know a seminarist
couId work as a Iaborer
When you need to, you work
So if a job comes aIong,
you take it?
Yes
Aren't you wondering
why I've offered you a ride?
Yes
I know that your duty
is to preach and guide peopIe
But you're young, you have time,
you can do that Iater
It's your hands that I need
I don't need your tongue
or your mind
I'm Iucky that those hands
beIong to a true beIiever
With the patience, endurance
and perseverance that you Iearn
you're the best person
to carry out this job
You're not teIIing me
what I have to do
I know my decision
goes against your beIiefs
You beIieve God gives Iife
and takes it when He sees fit
But there comes a time
when a man can't go on
He's exhausted and
can't wait for God to act
So he decides to act himseIf
There, that's what's
caIIed ''suicide''
You see, the word ''suicide''
isn't onIy made
for dictionaries
It has to have
a practicaI appIication
And here's the appIication
Man has to decide
on its appIication
I don't reaIIy understand.
TeII me what I have to do
If I can, I'II do it for you
I've decided to free myseIf
from this Iife
What for?
It wouIdn't heIp you to know
and I can't taIk about it
And you wouIdn't understand
It's not because
you don't understand
but you can't feeI what I feeI
You can sympathize, understand
show compassion.
But feeI my pain? No
You suffer and so do I.
I understand you
You comprehend my pain
but you can't feeI it
That's why I ask you
to be a true MosIem
and heIp me. Can you?
Yes, I understand you.
But suicide is wrong
Since the Hadiths,
our tweIve Imams and the Koran
refer to suicide
and say that man
mustn't kiII himseIf
God entrusts man's body to him
Man must not torment that body
I understand you, but suicide,
viewed from every angIe...
That's right
but I toId you
that I didn't need a Iecture
If I had wanted a Iecture
I'd have turned to someone
with more experience,
who's finished his studies
I'm simpIy asking
for a heIping hand
My hand does God's justice
What you want
wouIdn't be just
I know that suicide
is one of the deadIy sins
But being unhappy
is a great sin too
When you're unhappy
you hurt other peopIe
Isn't that a sin too?
When you hurt others,
isn't that a sin?
Hurting your famiIy...
your friends
hurting yourseIf
isn't that a sin?
If I hurt you,
that isn't a sin
but if I kiII myseIf,
it is?
You're right
hurting the peopIe cIose to you
is a great sin too
I think that God is mercifuI
and so great
that He doesn't want to see
His creatures suffer
He's so great
that He can't possibIy
want to force us to Iive
That's why He grants man
this soIution
Have you ever thought
about the meaning of this?
I've thought about it
but not Iike you have
In any case
our taIk won't get us anywhere
This isn't the time or pIace
Get out now. Next to that tree,
there's a hoIe
Go and Iook.
I'II expIain afterwards
Go on. Take a Iook
Get in
I'II expIain now
I've decided to swaIIow
aII my sIeeping piIIs tonight
and then come and Iie down
in that hoIe
To sIeep
What I want you to do
is wait untiI dawn
then come here
Iike a kind brother
and cover me with soiI.
That's aII
0f course
I foIIow the Koran
when it says-
This work wiII bring you
not onIy Heaven's reward
but aIso a materiaI reward so you
won't need to work this summer
The Koran says
You shaII not kiII yourseIf
What's the difference
between kiIIing someone
and kiIIing yourseIf?
KiIIing yourseIf is kiIIing
What's your decision?
Why don't you get out?
My friend has cooked an omeIette
and it smeIIs good. Let's eat
You'II find a soIution
Thank you! I know he's cooked
but eggs are bad for me!
Some other time! Good-bye!
Mister, mister
Mister, move your car.
The digger has to work
CIear the way
Move your car,
the digger has to work
What are you doing here?
This is no pIace to sit down!
Are you sick?
Come on, move your car!
You can't sIeep here!
If you want cement,
you have to go to the office
Come on, take your car
Why have you come here?
Are you sick?
Do you want some tea?
Stand up, take your car
Come on... Come on
Thank you.
So, no more questions?
No
You've got your bearings?
That tree is a good Iandmark
Yes
So, no more questions?
No probIems?
No probIems but...
But what?
When you want to heIp someone
You have to do it properIy,
with aII your heart
It's better...
more just and more reasonabIe
You can even use your hands
instead of a spade
Keep your feeIings
for more essentiaI things
But how?
What's your job?
I aIready toId you
What speciaIization?
ShoveIIing earth
doesn't require speciaIization
Just shoveIIing earth
If I couId heIp in another way
I'd prefer that
Just do what I ask
But what heIp?
If a man
wants to heIp his feIIow man
he ought to do it differentIy!
He can save a Iife
I won't be responsibIe
for someone's death
but, since you ask,
I'II say yes
But it's hard.
Admit that it's not easy!
If you don't expIain your probIem,
who can heIp you?
You don't know me
But you have reIatives,
friends, a brother
Forgive me for prying
It's either a famiIy probIem
or debts
Every probIem has its soIution
But if you don't taIk
no one can heIp you
We aII have probIems in Iife
If we aII chose this way
out of every tiny probIem
there wouId be no one
Ieft on earth
Isn't that right? No one!
Not a Iiving souI!
Turn Ieft, pIease
-I don't know this road.
-I know it
It's Ionger
but better and more beautifuI
I've been a prisoner
of this desert for 35 years
I'II teII you something
that happened to me
It was just after I got married
We had aII kinds of troubIes
I was so fed up with it
that I decided
to end it aII
0ne morning, before dawn
I put a rope in my car
My mind was made up,
I wanted to kiII myseIf
I set off for Mianeh.
This was in 1 960
I reached
the muIberry tree pIantations
I stopped there.
It was stiII dark
I threw the rope over a tree
but it didn't catch hoId
I tried once, twice
but to no avaiI
So then I cIimbed the tree
and tied the rope on tight
Then I feIt something soft
under my hand. MuIberries
DeIiciousIy sweet muIberries
I ate one.
It was succuIent,
then a second and third
SuddenIy, I noticed
that the sun was rising
over the mountaintop
What sun, what scenery,
what greenery!
AII of a sudden, I heard
chiIdren heading off to schooI
They stopped to Iook at me
They asked me to shake the tree
The muIberries feII and they ate
I feIt happy
Then I gathered some muIberries
to take them home
My wife was stiII sIeeping
When she woke up,
she ate muIberries as weII
And she enjoyed them too
I had Ieft to kiII myseIf
and I came back with muIberries
A muIberry saved my Iife
A muIberry saved my Iife
You ate muIberries,
so did your wife,
and everything was fine
No, it wasn't Iike that,
but I changed
Afterwards, it was better
but I had in fact changed my mind
I feIt better
Every man on earth
has probIems in his Iife
That's the way it is.
There are so many peopIe on earth
There isn't one famiIy
without probIems
I don't know your probIem
otherwise I couId expIain better
When you go to see a doctor
you teII him where it hurts
Excuse me,
you're not Turkish, are you?
Here's a joke.
Don't feeI offended
A Turk
goes to see a doctor.
He teIIs him:
''When I touch my body
with my finger, it hurts
''When I touch my head, it hurts,
my Iegs, it hurts
''my beIIy, my hand, it hurts''
The doctor examines him
and then teIIs him:
''Your body's fine
but your finger's broken!''
My dear man,
your mind is iII
but there's nothing wrong
with you. Change your outIook
I had Ieft home to kiII myseIf
but a muIberry changed me
an ordinary, unimportant muIberry
The worId isn't the way
you see it
You have to change your outIook
and change the worId
Be optimistic
Look at things positiveIy
You're in your prime!
Because of some minor probIem
you want to commit suicide
For one singIe probIem
Life is Iike a train
that keeps on moving forward
and then reaches the end
of the Iine, the terminus
And death waits at the terminus
0f course,
death is a soIution
but not at first,
not during your youth
Forgive me for dragging you off
aIong this rocky road
You think something is good,
then reaIize you're wrong
The main thing is to think hard
You beIieve what you do is right
but then you reaIize
that you're wrong
TaIk, say something
to give me a breather
I've taIked too much,
I've said everything
I've given a whoIe speech.
Just say something!
Turn Ieft here, pIease
In any case, if you don't taIk,
I'II taIk some more
If you don't taIk,
I wiII
Have you Iost aII hope?
Have you ever Iooked at the sky
when you wake in the morning?
At dawn, don't you want to see
the sun rise?
The red and yeIIow of the sun
at sunset,
don't you want to see that
anymore?
Have you seen the moon?
Don't you want to see the stars?
The night of the fuII moon,
don't you want to see it again?
You want to cIose your eyes?
PIease, take the right fork!
The peopIe on the other side
wouId Iike to take a Iook here
and you want to rush over there!
Don't you ever want to drink
water from a spring again?
0r wash your face in that water?
Turn right!
If you Iook at the four seasons
each season brings fruit
In summer, there's fruit,
in autumn too
winter brings different fruit
and spring too
No mother can fiII her fridge
with such a variety of fruit
for her chiIdren
No mother can do as much
for her chiIdren
as God does for His creatures
You want to refuse aII that?
You want to give it aII up?
You want to give up
the taste of the cherries?
Don't. I'm your friend,
I'm begging you!
Turn right
Turn right,
this is the main road
Turn Ieft, pIease
Before I get out
I'm going to sing you
a song in Turkish
It means: ''My Iove,
I'm fIying off, come to me
''I'm hounded from my friend's
garden, come to me
''From happy days before
''I've faIIen on hard times,
come to me''
TeII me,
we bareIy know each other
You go, I'm your friend.
You stay, I'm your friend
In any case, I'm your friend
You stay, I'm your friend.
You go, I'II be your friend too
Good-bye
Do you work here?
Wait.
TeII me what you do
I toId you, I work here
at the NaturaI History Museum
No, I mean tomorrow morning
Tomorrow, I come at dawn.
I caII twice:
''Mister... Mister...''
Badii!
Badii, and you repIy
Then I take your hand
to heIp you out
And if I don't repIy?
You wiII repIy! Inch'AIIah,
I know what you'II say
But what if I don't repIy?
I'II do what you asked me to do,
don't worry!
Say it to put my mind at ease
Some things
are easier to do than to say
In any case, you'II do it
If it wasn't for my chiId,
I wouIdn't
BeIieve me, it's hard
It's a deaI
I come
and I cover you with earth
You take your money
and you Ieave
What a reIief for you!
I must go,
the kids are waiting
May this money heIp
to cure your chiId
Keep your promise,
or you won't be bIessed
I hope you'II be aII right
Take this now.
You'II get the rest tomorrow
Thanks for bringing me back here.
Thanks again!
I'II see you at six tomorrow.
0r rather, you'II see me at six
God wiIIing, you'II see me too
Take it, take the money
Thank you but no.
After I do the job

Birds don't faII into the net
to make you happy
Mr. Bagheri, someone for you
First, you have to Iie them
on their backs
and wet the thorax feathers
with a sponge
Then sIit them open
with a scaIpeI
aIong the whoIe Iength
of the body
Don't cut too deepIy
or the innards wiII spiII out
Mr. Bagheri

No thank you. I'm busy

You're weII then?
-I have something to teII you.
-Go on
When you come in the morning
bring two smaII stones
and throw them at me
I might just be asIeep
but stiII aIive!
Two stones aren't enough.
I'II use three
Shake my shouIders too!
Perhaps I'II be aIive
You promised me!
Even if they behead me,
I'II keep my word
You promised. Don't forget,
don't Iet me down
Can you hear me?
TeII your men to stay
near the tree to rest
The shoot is over
We're here for a sound take
