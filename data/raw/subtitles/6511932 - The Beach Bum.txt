To help me out, I'm gonna throw
a few fresh lines on you,
a little poem
I'm working on right now.
Last night...
Come on, Moondog!
...when I went to bed in a van,
I was... I was
thinking about you.
I was thinking about you.
And I got up about 4:00 a.m.,
and I had to take a piss,
as guys do,
and I looked down at my dick...
...and I had such affection
in my heart when I did.
Knowing that it had been
inside you twice today...
...made me feel beautiful.
Moondog!
That's what I got.
Have a great night.

Before I accept whatever award
it is they're giving me today,
I just want to start off with
a little bit of poetic foreplay.
I wrote this in the wilds
of Kentucky.
I didn't have peach fuzz
over my pecker at the time.
I was surrounded
by inbreds, rednecks,
juveniles, limp-dicks
and all that times 14.
It's a little poem I wrote
that I always like to read first
because it takes me back
to such a pure place.
- Okay. Check this out.
- Moondog!
One day, I will swallow up
the world.
And when I do, I hope you all
perish violently.
Thank you. How about another one

Hey, hey, hey, what's shaking,
little ginger goat?
- I miss you.
- Oh, I miss you, too, sweetie.
Well, it's boring here
without you.
I know, right?
I can only imagine.
Well, I need you back here
in Miami.
I need my husband.
Eh, civilization.
Come on, and I need help
with the wedding.
Wha... I mean, do you really?
Heather and I need you
to come back home.
Ah, you know my home
is down here in the Keys
with all the burnouts, sweetie.
I'm a bottom-feeder.
I got to go low to get high.
You know that.
No, it's here, and we have so
many friends and guests coming.
No, your friends.
No, I don't have any friends.
Yes, you do.
Well, at least they pretend
to be your friends.
You know what?
'Rie just popped over.
Moondog, what it do?
Oh, is that the Linger'
one and only?
Man, you already knew it, man.
I just stopped by
to drop off some roses
to your lovely wife, man.
Keep it pushing.
You know what I'm talking about?
But I wish you
could see Heather.
Oh, my goodness.
She's just glowing
- and so happy about the wedding, baby.
- "Glowing"?
Why is she glowing?
It's because she's so in love.
Oh, shit.
You scared me for a minute.
Wait, what does she know
about love, anyway?
She's 16 years old.
She doesn't know what love is.
She's too young to get married.
She's 22, Moondog.
Ah, 22, whatever.
I mean, besides,
she's marrying such a limp-dick.
Yeah, you're probably right.
- Bye, boo-boo. I love you.
- Bye, Minnie-boo. Linger'.
Moondog, until
we meet again. Bad moon rising.

Moondog, buenos días.
Poor baby.
I know.
I think it's time to go home.
- Hey!
- I missed you, my love.
Oh, yeah. One more time, baby.
Did you miss me?
- I got it. I got it.
- Oh, honey.
I got it. I...
Oh. Oh, look at you.
No, you've been gone too long.
- Look at you.
- You have to woo me.
Woo, woo, doo, doo,
did you miss me?
Good.
I forgot how rich we were.
Yeah, you did forget, Moondog.
Mm.
I missed all ten of you.
- Mmm.
- Mm.
Oh, that's so good. Oh, God.
You're never gonna write
that new book, honey. Oh!
I'm having lunch
with my agent today.
- Oh, God.
- We'll be going over the new book.
- It's not written yet.
- Of course not.
I think this is
gonna be a good one, baby.
Well, make sure
it doesn't take too long.
I want everything
to go perfectly
for Heather's wedding today.
- I'm so fucking on time.
- Uh-uh.
I'm the last guy
you got to worry about.
- No. Sweetie, seriously.
- Mm. Mm?
You cannot be late. Okay?
Because you just can't.
- Okay.
- I'm not gonna be late, sweetie.
I forgot to tell you
that, uh, I invited
- your mother to the wedding.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, and...
and Heather's not wearing
the white dress.
She's gone with the oyster one
with the pearls.
Oh, sh... Oh.
Oh, you can go, Akiko.
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Oh, that's right-right...
Right there, honey.
Oh, Moondog.
It's so nice of 'Rie to let us
have the wedding at his place.
He's really pulled out
all the stops.
The Lingerie Doggy Dogg.
He got ordained
just for the event.
Dearly beloved...
No, I wouldn't say that shit
like that.
Players and playettes.
Today, we have this man
coming for this woman.
Bitch, now, you know you're
too young to be married, right?
You got a lot
of living to do, baby.
Ain't nobody even made
your little pink tweeter
squirt yet, huh?
You need to settle down
somewhere
and run for
the motherfucking hills.
Shit, I got sidetracked
for a minute.
Fuck!
You know, it breaks
my heart, Moondog.
It breaks my heart 'cause you
a motherfucking has-been, boy.
Whatever the fuck
that is. Is that a bad thing?
Goddamn,
it's a bad thing, Moondog.
As you're forever aging,
I feel obliged
to be truthful with you
at all times.
- Hey, you're a shitty agent.
- It's sad, Moondog.
You used to be a motherfucking
ATM for me, boy.
You have pissed away your talent
on women and booze
and total excess.
Now you're talking.
Yeah, all those things,
that's what feeds the juices up
here in my noggin, man.
Through my loins,
up the autobahn.
My spirit and mind, man.
I-I'm... I'm moist right now.
I'm lubricated.
Yeah, but you the fastest horse
in my stable, boy.
You think I want to take
a motherfucking shotgun,
put it in your mouth,
blow your brains
all over my nice
motherfucking clothes?
That's the fucking Lewis
I'm talking about.
You think I want to do that?
You was a revolutionary writer.
You were a radical.
Your words meant
something to people.
Either way, it's a good thing
I'm rich, Lewis.
Especially since I'm well hung.
You ain't rich, Moondog.
Your wife's rich.
That's true.
And it's been a while
since I had you in there,
but you ain't well hung, boy!
- Get in there. Get in there.
- You ain't well hung!
- Get in there. Come on.
- I mean, goddamn. God...
San Francisco standoff, baby?
Oh!
I read in The Pelican today
Heather's getting married.
It's a big day.
Yeah. This afternoon,
handing her off.
Well, congratulations.
And you know what?
I worked through it.
And I'm not even upset
even a little bit
that I was not included
in the ceremonies.
Oh, you thought
you'd be included?
No, well, I-I... like I said,
I-I'm busy anyway, so like
I said, I'm-I'm not offended.
And-and I just want to be clear,
this doesn't have to do, uh...
Oh, when you walked in on her,
saw that...
- I didn't know she was changing.
- She said you stayed
a little longer
than a few seconds.
Well...
I used to mix signals back then.
Hey, man.
- It was a... it-it was a confusing time.
I would misread
things often, and...
Whatever raises your skirt, man.
It never bothered me.
Well, I'm busy regardless,
so I-I could not attend
even if you...
if people had a change of heart.
I-I'm-I'm-I'm...
have other obligations.
- Sweet-ass, man.
- Yeah.
Hey, here's your ball, man.
Let's knock this fucker
back on the fairway and get a good lie.
- Yeah.
- Name is?
- Shardanne.
Now, how does that
say "Shardanne"
all the way up
the middle of your thigh?
You know what my horoscope said?
"Don't play with matches."
You don't have to, 'cause
the fire's already lit, sweetie.
Little veils behind...
And you got a lot of great
things going on all over
- your B-O-D-Y right now.
- Mm.
- I got leopard.
- Leopard?
- Yeah.
- I've got volcano orange.

Hello?
- Moondog. Where are you?
- Hey.
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, hey, hey, baby.
Uh, right around the corner.
Finished up a little yoga class.
A little downward doggystyle.
You are gonna miss
our daughter's wedding.
No, I wouldn't
miss it for the world.
Uh, look, I'm right around
the corner, honey.
The limp-dick groom
is melting down.
Okay, well, hurry up, please.
- I love you, baby.
- You're stressing me.
- I'm on my way!
- Okay, because the wedding is starting.
Lingerie? Let's hit it, baby.
Love between a boy and a girl
can be so wonderful.
Especially when it's a girl
that I've known
ever since she was born.
- Aw.
- Heather, you know I love you
and I love your family,
and I'm so happy
to see you get married today.
To him.
And you got to be ready
to take on everything
that she stands for,
and that includes her...
What are you doing?
- You're going too fast.
- What the...?
Bye, Mom.
Whoa! No!
- Oh!
- Damn, Dog!
I'm just kidding, sweetie.
That's not my mom.
You know that. Mm. How are you?
- Good. I...
- Hey, can I borrow that, Linge'?
- Sir, yes, sir.
- All right, see,
everyone knows this
is my daughter.
Me and my Minnie-boo's daughter.
Aw.
And we're gonna be handing away
the bride to be, right now,
- a little family tradition we got before we...
- Hi.
...hand over any daughters
in our family.
We just got to...
- Wait.
- ...lightly check the package.
- What are you doing?
- The other side. That's not bad.
Like five inches flaccid.
Ah, Mr. 'Rie, your mic, sir.
Thank you.
Pardon the interruption.
I would like to thank Mr.
Moondog for that presentation.
Today, dearly beloved,
we come together
to give Heather to Mr. Limpy.
You in a world of motherfucking
problems with this family.
They fucked-up.
Is that the
motherfucking Moondog?
The one and only Palmia,
Lingerie.
Moondog, be careful.
This here,
I can't even explain it, man.
This is sort of kind of like
a hallucinogenic.
- Yeah, you see...
- You gonna see all kind of shit, man.
- for 16 weeks?
- Uh-huh.
This is that thing.
Wait, wait, wait.
Be careful, Dog.
You about to go to a place
you never been before.
That shit don't come
with seat belts.
He almost ruined the whole day.
Don't say that.
No, it was fun.
- He's fucked-up, Mom.
- Ah...
- It's just Moondog.
- Don't make excuses for him.
You just kind of have
to accept that he's...
he's from another dimension.
He really is.
And you have to love him for it.
I do.
You and Limp-Dick are gonna
have to accept that.
No, but I do think Moondog's
mother coddled him way too much.
I've told her this before.
I mean,
he wore a diaper
until he was eight.
Honestly, I think she put brandy
in his little bottle.
Man, my nu... ah... my nuts
are throbbing right now.
First time I hit this shit,
nigga went in a coma.
I forgot how
to motherfucking breathe.
- What you see?
- 15 lights and 39 ladies.
What about those cartoons
right there? Can you see 'em?
Are we looking
at the same screen?
Are you sleeping with Lingerie?
Yes, yes.
And he's a wonderful lover.
Does Dad know?
Your father
wouldn't mind, darling.
Your father goes away.
You know, 'Rie is...
Whoa.
Um, I think it was just
'Rie's been there.
I mean, at your third birthday,
it was 'Rie
who brought the pony in.
I remember.
- And he blew out my candles.
- Exactly.
Well, he was stoned.
What's happening down here, cap?
Just fuck with me
one time, Dog.
You gonna love this. Slide in
where you ride in, Dog.
What the fuck?
Moondog, welcome
to the NASA Command Center
of Mary Jane.
This shit only grows
in an isolated pond in Jamaica.
It sprouts out of
a pink fluorescent moss patch.
Pink fluorescent?
Mm, mm, mm.
This weed here, it's so good,
it could make a motherfucker
yearn for the afterlife.
It could send you to
the outer limits of humanity.
That's the keys and the trees
to my success.
'Cause once a year,
I fly to Jamaica,
They turn their cheek this way,
and we fly off that way.
- Get out.
- Mm-hmm.
You don't remember
this, but the day you were born
and you came out
of your mother's womb,
I was there between your legs,
and your head came out
nice and smooth,
with guts all over it.
And it was a bloody mess,
but it was poetry.
Aw.
- - I saw your face,
but I didn't quite see your eyes
until I stuck my pinky finger
in this, like, placenta veil and
peeled it back over your face
and there you were.
And that's when I put my hands
on both sides of your head
and escorted you
into this world.
Aw.
I want to say...
What's your name again?
For real.
- Frank.
- Frank.
- Franky B.
- Now...
I give you my daughter
to put your hands
and take her into
the rest of the world.
- Aw.
- Thank you.
Beautiful.
Love you.
Oh, shit.
In the dusk, you see...
you see that woman?
She's singing to us.
Calling us back over the...
vistas of our past
right back to the child
who huddles under the piano.
He's sitting there with the boom
of the tingling strings.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
he's got his hand...
he's got his hand on it.
On the foot of his mother.
And she smiles as she sings.
And in spite of myself,
the insidious mastery of song
has betrayed me back once again,
till the heart of me...
...where I weep to belong.
Oh.
That is the most brilliant shit
I've ever heard.
You wrote that?
- Yeah, I did.
- That is some wild shit, Dog.
Glad you like it, man. I wrote
that in my younger years.
Whew.
Actually, a guy named
D.H. Lawrence wrote it,
all right, but I stole it
and plagiarized it
in my seventh grade
poetry contest, and guess what.
I won that motherfucker.
- Moondog, you my motherfucker.
- Hey, hey.
Family and friends,
thank you for coming and sharing
this perfect day with us.
This day has been
off the hook, am I right?
And, Heather, you're my angel.
Thanks.
Where have you been?
Waiting for you.
Have you seen Moondog, darling?
No, I haven't,
but what I do know is
when I don't see him,
and I see you,
that means there's
more time for us.

Where's Minnie?
Watch it.
- Got it?
- Yep.
Airbag deployed.
Possible chest trauma.
Jesse, pull her in place,
please.
Trauma Two's been prepped.
Hold door.
Trauma Two.
Watch yourselves.
Coming through.
Pull her in place, please.
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey.
Stay there.
Aw.
Mmm, boop, boop, boop, mmm.
What do you want to do?
- I...
- What do you want to do?
You're such a fuckup.
Mm...
Aw, Minnie-boo.
And through Almighty God,
we commend the soul
of our departed sister,
and we commit her body
to the ground.
Earth to earth. Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.
Minnie was a fine woman,
and we, her family and friends,
are blessed to have known her.
In the fullness of time,
and with the help
of the good Lord,
we shall all be with her again.
Until that time,
may the blessings
of God Almighty, the Father...
How you doing, honey?
- I'm okay.
- Mm.
I'm okay. How are you?
"When I was born,
I was happy.
I was born on the ocean
in a gigantic boat."
Big fuckin' boat.
"My parents were fishermen.
"Both were great
long-distance runners.
"I was read to as a child,
"mostly books about
survival and contortion.
"I drank off the teats
of caribou.
"Scrumptious. Tasted like
jasmine and cupcakes.
- 'Cause I remember..."
- Fuckin' good, Moondog.
"I lived through several wars.
"They were never fun.
"Why? 'Cause I was shot at.
"But I fuckin' returned fire.
"I wrote letters to loved ones.
"I memorized winter haiku.
"I played games with myself.
"Counted the lily pads.
Stared in the mirror.
I did what I had to do...
to keep going."
- Damn, I was good, man.
- "I made sandwiches.
"I played the dance.
It was hot.
"It was dry.
It was raining, it was not.
I was fluent in all things
dealing with nature."
That's great poetry.
Dot, dot, dot, dot.
Come on,
what's "nothing" mean, huh?
Nothing.
That's what it means.
Not a single cent until...
Till what?
You got to publish your novel,
or you get nothing.
Uh...
Minnie always had a feeling
she was gonna die before you.
She used to call me up
in a panic.
Someone did her tarot cards.
Predicted it all.
Freaked her out.
But she was right, I guess.
Her will is very precise.
Minnie had a will.
Motherfucker, that's weird.
Yes, she did.
She was concerned that if
anything ever happened to her,
you'd piss away
her family's fortune.
And she wanted you to finally
publish your novel.
- Poems.
- Whatever.
I write poetry,
you little bitch.
Until then, half of everything
goes to Heather.
And the other half of yours
sits frozen in escrow
for a bit of time
until you fulfill
the requirements stated here.
Ah, it's about time
you guys got here.
I'm gonna need some help
carrying my luggage.
If you're coming in,
kick off your shoes.
Effective immediately,
you can go back to your home
and get your typewriter
and some crappy underwear,
but that's it.
You're now persona non grata.
Minnie owned everything.
Everything was in her name.
You're now, basically, a bum.
She owned the cars,
the clothes,
the houses,
country club memberships,
cats and dogs.
She did not own all the cats.
Minnie loved you very much.
She just hated seeing you
throw it all away.
Thank you, Minnie-boo!
Fuck you as well.
I mean, to be fair,
there's a lot
of bad guys out there, right?
You guys are with me
in my wife's closet.
This is what you went
to the academy,
though, for, right,
shit like this?
Look after guys like me
at times like this.
You never know
when you're gonna catch
a fully dressed man unarmed.
I'm gonna wear
my Minnie-boo's Uggs.
Wear them in her memory.
She had abnormally large feet.
Great fuckin' style.
See those books?
I wrote those.
You're probably not
big readers, are you?
That's cool.
There's no pressure.
Alvarez,
I wrote that one for you.
José!
Listen, I'm gonna take
a little leave of absence.
But I left you a little bushel
of the sticky-icky
that you like, huh.
I can't tell you where it is,
'cause these guys might go
and try and smoke it,
but it's the same place
as last time.
Keep the pool hot.
I put it at 120 for you.
That's what I'm talking about.
Keep it there, baby,
and add the chlorine,
'cause I may have a gangbang
when I get back.
I will invite your mother.
- Thank you, Mr. Moondog.
- Wish me luck.
I'm off to write the next
great American novel.
Will do.
Thank you, sir.
Mom did this for a reason.
I-I'm not gonna
let you stay here.
- Okay.
- Dad, sorry.
How about just loaning me
a little bit?
Just a little bit
of spending cash
so I can get by
for a week or two.
Dad, I just...
I'll be here for you,
but just don't come back
till you're ready.
Honey, I'm not asking
for the world here.
I'm just asking for
a wee bit of compassion
for your father.
I know, but when's it gonna end?
You're gonna keep coming back
and asking me
for more and more and more.
Dad, I love you,
but I can't do that.
- Okay.
- I just can't. I...
Just come back
when you're ready, but I...
Okay, I understand.
- I'm sorry.
- I understand.
Don't apologize, sweetie.
You'll see.
I'll be back,
better than ever.
Back so good you're gonna see
that I was never gone
in the first place.
I love you, Dad.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
I still don't understand
how you married
this milk-drinking closet case.
- I mean, look at him.
- Closet case?
He's got no magic,
he's got no style.
He's dressed up
like a JV cheerleader.
I had high hopes for you,
Heather.
High fuckin' hopes.
Fuck off!
Get out of here,
you fuckin'... turd!
It's okay.
Sorry, he just makes me crazy.
He may be a jerk,
but he's a great man.
He's brilliant.
I mean, you'll never be
great or brilliant.
You're dependable.
Oh, thanks.

See if you can make

Hi, Heather.
I am Toothless Phil.
I am a good friend
of your daddy.
We want you to be happy.
We love you
just the way you are.
Who's your daddy?
Moondog's your daddy.
He loves you.
Mm-hmm.
Back again, huh?
Your choice: prison or rehab.
Is there a third option?
Nope. Last chance.
Rehab it is.
Preferably somewhere tropical.
I'm remanding you into
the custody of your daughter.
She will escort you to a rehab facility now.
- Great.
You'll need to spend
a mandatory 12 months there
getting your life
back together, Moondog.
- 12 days is not a problem.
- 12 months.
- Okay.
- 12 months?
It all stops now...
the foolishness.
I understand. I need a change
of pace. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And if you mess this up,
it's jail time you're getting.
If-if I may suggest, Your Honor.
- Tell her, Moondog!
- I was told
of this amazing rehab facility
in the Virgin Islands.
It's got an open bar
and 24-hour Thai massage.
A little jerky-jerk to take
the edge off
during the detox period.
Drain the old jizz pipe
with the antitoxins.
- Excuse me?
- All due respect
to my own personal fluid
transition into my sobriety.
I want to let you know
that the therapeutic value
of a groin massage
during the acute withdrawal
phase is off the charts
- fucking medicinal.
- It's not gonna happen.
Take it easy, Judge!
- It's not gonna happen.
- Why you got to be like that?
You know, I was... I was a real
fan of your writing, Moondog.
Yeah?
Shut up.
But, you know,
it amazes me how someone
that can write so beautifully
can be so crude and reckless.
Don't you be acting like you
knew where the rooster crow.
Don't let us down, Moondog.
We're rooting for you. Next.
Get him out of here.
Heather, my dear,
would you be so kind
as to pull over
and get your old man
one final beer?
Sure, Dad.
Yeah. Give me a, uh,
Lucky Lotto Triple 7
and a... and a cigar, would you?
Sure.
You don't sell acid, do you?
No.
That's too bad, man.
This place used to.
Did your mother love me?
Yes, Dad.
She said that?
Of course.
She think I was brilliant?
She thought you were a genius.
She said that?
That's why she stayed with you
all those years.
And that's why
you've always been able
to get away
with everything, Dad.
Oh, Minnie-boo.
She had an incredible ass.
Could fellate like a python.
Fuck, she could
fellate a python if she...
I'm gonna miss her.
Let's go to rehab.
Mm. I'll try
and do better, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
You can do this.
Mm. Okay. All right, Sunrise.
Let's get this party started.
It really wasn't up to me.
You should've heard
the judge, man.
She-she swung a hard gavel.
She was a fan of mine, too.
Which is kind of weird, but...
I mean, I wouldn't have
come down here like, you know,
if I didn't have a little bit
of a nudge, you know?
Well, this lady's very happy
that you're here.
We have your entire year
planned out.
So when you leave us,
you'll be a changed person.

I cannot change

What? Who's repeating?
Who's repeating?
Ah, you are.
Yeah, uh, first time I was here,
I was... I was drinking a lot.
So I decided to make...
make myself a better person.
I decided to come here.
Uh, when I got out,
I was good for about six months.
And my friends
were like, "Dude,
you don't have to... you don't
have to drink to have fun."
I said, "That's right.
We could do weed
or cocaine or heroin."
And we did 'em all.
My dad's a preacher. He's the
one that fucking put me in here.
- Why?
- 'Cause he caught me huffing paint a few times.
Also, I was breaking
into people's houses
and just burning shit.
Like, nothing real bad.
I love lighting shit on fire.
- Yeah. Eh.
- Nobody was home.
We didn't find out
the kids were upstairs
until later,
and if I wasn't there,
they would've fucking burned
to death. I got 'em out.

When they see a dolphin,
I act all fucking stoked, right?
"Oh, it's a dolphin!
Look at the baby dolphin! Look!"
Tell them to dive in.
Make sure they don't drown.
Only had four deaths
on my watch.
Only four?

eight straight years
of dolphin touring
is a terrific record.

Dolphins, man. I love some
fucking dolphins, man.
The sounds that come out
of their mouths.
- They trying to communicate with you.

Blew me away.

I'm telling you, I wouldn't
be able to live like this

Oh, oh, I got something.
- Get your ass. Goddamn.
- Oh!
Oh, we gonna fry
this motherfucker up.
Yes.
Make sure to get
your taste buds ready.
Yeah, this is almost done.
Look here, Moondog,
you come work for me, man.
It'll be great.
Dolphins are great.
Way they go up and down
in the water like a porpoise.
You'll love that shit, man.
- That sounds cool, Wack.
- Yeah.
I'm in, man.
- Aah!
- What the fuck!
- Fucking...
- Man, that shit's loaded.

something, shoot this shit here.

Yeah. We'll become

- Makes me walk like a pimp.
- Mm.
Some shrapnel
partially shredded my nut sack,
but everything still works.
Still banging.

- Ba-ba-ba-ba.
Well, usually, when people call
and say they're coming
for the dolphin tour,
- they come and they pay cash.
- Yeah. Right. Right.
- My bread and butter, baby. My bread and butter.
- Yeah...
- So you can tell in the tone of their voice, man...

All right, we're in the middle
of mating season.
If you see some humping,
don't look away.
It's cool-looking.
It's nature in all its glory.
Dolphins love to bone.
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, you listen up, kids. Huh?
Greatest dolphin guy
in the history of dolphin guys
is sharing wisdom with you.
- Thanks, Moondog.
- That's a fact.
Now, what he failed to mention
is that these dolphins
got what's called
a-a corkscrew pecker.
All right?
A little, whippy, windy,
wranky kind of thing.
It's true, kids.
It's sort of like a corkscrew.
So keep a lookout.
And it's orgy season,
so hopefully we'll
get to see something,
- some real wild stuff.
- Everybody's fucking.
They're really horny
this time of season.
So watch your back, Carnello.
Some of them prefer redheads.
- Is this thing safe?
- Very safe.
I wouldn't have you on here
if it wasn't safe.
Family, I just got to tell you,
I love dolphins so much.
After the day,
you're gonna love dolphins
as much as I love dolphins.
They don't hurt you.
They just want to love you.
Dolphins know this man.
They come from all over the
world to come see Captain Wack.
And they're coming
to see me today.
And you guys get to be
on his boat today.
All right, all right, all right.
I see a few out there.
We in business.
Who wants to dive in?
- No, we're good.
- No, we're good, we're good.
It's prime mating season.
Seaweed is an aphrodisiac.
Wonderful.
- I think they're getting cold feet, Wack.
All right, last chance. Any takers?
- It's all yours.
Y'all a bunch of pussies.
Show them
how it's done, Captain.
We're just here
for a little tour.
Dolphins, here I come, baby.
Yeah.
Get in! This water is beautiful.
Look at the dolphin.
Honey, look at the dolphin.
Isn't that cute?
Lots of dolphins, motherfuckers!
- Does that look right?
- Get in!
- The water's perfect.
- All good, Wack?
- You good?
- It's great!
Dolphins, here I come!
Honey, honey, honey.
That doesn't look
like a dolphin fin.
Captain, that kind... that
kind of looks like a shark fin.
This must be all part
of the show.
I'm having a great time!
It's perfect!
- Mr. Wack, come back!
- Mr. Wack? Mr. Wack!
Come back, Mr. Wack.
- What the... what the fuck?!
- Come back!
Help! Aah!
Motherfucker, Captain.
You put on a fucking show, man.
This ain't
no motherfucking show!
Aah!
Whoa! That's cool-looking.
When's the last time
he clipped his toenails?
Seriously, that's gnarly, man.
Oh, shit! Holy shit!
Oh, Lord!
- It's just a flesh wound. Don't worry.
That dolphin got teeth!
Oh, shit! Where's my foot?
Okay, just hold my hand.
Fuck, Wack.
He got you pretty good, man.
Oh, man. Couldn't have been
a fucking dolphin.
Can't believe this shit, man.
I'm-I'm-I'm pretty sure it
wasn't a dolphin that bit you,
'cause look at your foot.
Listen, you're gonna be
all right.
You're gonna be just fine.
I mean, it's just
a little flesh wound.
You're gonna be up dancing
in no time.

Yeah. I am.

Foot for the hat? Huh?
Come on. Huh? There we go.

Come fuck with us.
There we go.
I think we need to look
at a positive I.D. on him.
Make sure the motherfucker
washes his feet.
Take your shoes off, Dog,
when you get
on the fucking boat.
Glad I came up on y'all, man.
You did, man, but it look like
you in some serious shit,
though, Dog.
- Yeah.
- Jimmy, tell him.
You in serious shit, man.
- How you figure it's serious?
- Motherfucker. I mean,
I heard from some guys
down, you know,
in the U.S... law people,
Keys people.
- Word's out down there.
- Word on the streets
that you did escape and then
the pigs is on your ass now.
Both are true.
- Def.
- That's not serious.
That sounds pretty cool,
the way you put it.
Yeah, sounds like a wanted man,
the way I put it.

I got something I gotta
get off my chest with you, man.
I don't even really know
how to say it.
I'm just gonna come clean.
I was having an affair
with Minnie, man.
Several years,
behind your back.
I'm talking about
really sexually wild
experiences with your wife, man.
Yeah, I figured as much.
But I do know
she didn't love me.
She loved my sex,
but she didn't love me.
I was the R-and-B singer
with the big ding-a-ling.
I was just a diversion
until you came back, you dig?
But she honestly loved you.
I know that for a fact.
She did, didn't she?
She loved the fuck
out of you, Moondog.
And I loved her, man.
Still do.
- So sexual.
- Hypersexual.
- Oh, man.
- Oh, man...
The moves that she'd do
in the bedroom.
She had these tiny hands.
they made my cock look so big.
Oh, wow, you should have seen
what mine looked like
in her hands.
The way she went down, I mean,
I could just see her right now.
- And then you make eye contact...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...
I hear you, I hear you.
Th-That's enough, that's enough.
I hear you.
I had a crazy-ass dream
to help you get out
that motherfuckin' thing
that you in.
I had a dream you was dressed
like a woman to help you escape.
- A woman?
- Yeah.
I had the same dream.
I had this guy,
a buddy in Vietnam,
dressed up like a geisha.
Walked out of the war.
- Get in touch with your...
- His femininity.
- Yeah, femininity.
- Tap into it, man.
It may not be a bad look
after all, you understand me?
I could see you
with a dress on.
Moondoggy-doggy
might get used to it.
Yeah. The Dog in a dress
and some high heels.
And let him strut the runway.
It's a ridiculous idea. It's...
It's kind of fuckin'
freaky ingenious, guys.
I think I already got
the underwear right.
And if I got my walk right,
this would be too easy.
Oh, look at this!
Go ahead and give 'em
the whole moon there, Moondog.
- You hear me?
- I hear you.
Hey, you actually
look good, Dog.
I mean, it's kind of
fuckin' freaky, right?
I mean,
it's supposed to look freaky.
Right now,
you a freaky little bitch.
That's what's gonna
throw the police off, you dig?
Moondog.
Ain't nobody gonna
fuckin' recognize you
in that shit right there,
especially the fuckin' pigs.
You know what the challenge
of this situation's gonna be?
Yes, ma'am?
Dudes are gonna want my shit.
Motherfuckin' Moondog!
We schleppin'
through the city unseen.
What a disguise.
A perfect disguise, baby.
Any of your bitches
gonna get hot on you
they see you riding around
with a hot blonde like me?
They gonna like the fact.
This is that interracial shit.
Like Jim Brown
with Raquel Welch.
You know what I'm talking about?
I love it when a plan
comes together.
Anything for a friend.
- Yes. Yes!
- This is what...
- I'm lookin' at heaven.
- Yes!
Heaven looks like, Linger'.
Think of it like this, Dog.
I'm gonna give you
so much of this,
you gonna be able to write you
a couple of novels
or that poetry shit.
- Ah, poetry.
- Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout poems
- out your motherfuckin' asshole.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
This... this is the safecracker
right here.
To crack the safe
to writing that thing,
and getting that money.
'Cause this is the key
to unlocking
all of those juices
in that head of yours.
Trust me.
- The cops, they here.
- Say what?
The pigs is here right now?
Fuck! I must have been
high as a motherfucker
when I hatched that plan.
Gas up the seaplane.
Go get my shit out
the magical room.
Somebody scrape up Moondog.
It's time to go.
Let's load this shit up.
Let's get rolling.
Stop dillydallying.
The cops is coming.
Load up the motherfuckin'
Rasta van.
I'm bringing y'all
for the music.
We on the run, like we used
to be back in the days.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Hurry, mon, hurry.
Put it in now. Move, move!
Lingerie, close the fuckin'
door. It's time to go.
You know I got the motherfuckin'
master plan.
My Rasta, he gonna fly you
to the Keys on my seaplane.
Time to get me down
to Key West, baby.
Cops ain't never gonna
catch the Moondog.
Moondog, come on, hurry up.
Get this shit on the plane,
fast like.
I hope we got
enough weed for this.
Shit.
This is gonna be fun.
Didn't know it'd be this easy.
Hey, uh... is he a good pilot?
Not at all.
- Not at all?
- No, man.
He got glaucoma
in both his eyes.
But when he's zooted
off of that shit,
he'll get you
where you need to be.
But, Dog, you gonna need
some cash for the splash.
Ah, that's gonna cush
the landing.
- Yes, sir.
- Well, what can I say, Linge'?
We shall meet again on some
distant shore, my friend.
Yeah.
The sun, the rain
and the motherfuckin' moon.
You make us proud down there,
you hear me?
Time for liftoff, Linge'.
Time for liftoff.
Be good, or be good at it.
- Yeah.
- When I smoke enough weed
and drink the 'shroom tea,
a few lines of dainty white
Bogotácoca...
- Yeah...
- Shit, man!
- Woof! Woof!
- Woof!
Man, I get insane vision,
and the vision
guide like a spirit
in a direct line
to our final destination.
- Destination, yeah.
- Safe and sound.
- I don't fuck around.
- Ah, you know what,
it doesn't even matter
what you said.
It just sounds so fuckin' good
how you say it.
You know, I'm 98% blind.
That's perfect.
They don't even know, man.
Moondog, what you got?!
Riding through the slipstream
with a whole lot of green.
Gimme some of that, bro!
- Moondog, I love you!
- Hey. Yeah.
Love you, too.
What's up, Moondog?
Ooh... Ooh...
Yeah, man!
Hey, Moondog.
- Honey, I'm home.
- Oh, Moondog!
Mm...
All right, that's enough!
This is my Cuban maid.
Ooh, I think I need
some of that.
Let's get the party started.
- All right.
- Salud.
All right!
Hey, Moondog!
Thank you for meeting
with me today.
Yeah, my pleasure.
I-I don't remember
the last time
I did one of these.
Got an interesting life.
How'd you pull it off?
How'd you do it?
I only pull it off how I do it.
I mean, look,
I could tell you that I've...
been trying to uncover the abyss
beneath my illusory connection
with the world.
I could tell you that it's
all written in the stars.
I could tell you
that I'm a reverse paranoiac.
I'm quite certain
that the world
is conspiring to make me happy.
All three of which are true,
but...
it's really
a little simpler than that.
I like to have fun, man.
Fun's the fucking gun, man.
Also, I like boats.
I like the water.
I like the sunshine.
I like beautiful women a lot.
And then I get
all these things going, man.
They're all turning me on.
My wires are connecting
upstairs,
and I start to hear music
in my head.
You know? And the world's
reverberating
back and forth,
and I hit the frequency,
and I start to dance to it,
and my fingers get moving,
my head's getting soupy,
I'm spinning all over
the fucking place,
and the fucking words come out.
It's like it's a fucking gift.
What makes you, Moondog,
different than all these
other people?
Seriously?
You mean the ones up north
on the mainland?
The ones racing
to their red light,
the ones stuck in their ways,
a little bit too busy
to check inside
and say howdy, howdy, do?
That shit's not for me, man.
I mean, fuck, man.
So many people trip themselves
when they're running downhill.
Life's hard enough. Why would
you fucking want to do that?
I mean, fuck, we're here
to have a good time.
I just want
to have a good time
until this shit's over, man.
This life gig's a fucking rodeo.
I'm gonna suck the nectar
out of it and fuck it raw-dog
till the wheels come off. Mmm.
- Let me ask you something.
- Come on.
- Off the record.
- Come on.
What's up
with the women's clothes?
- What women's clothes?
- Motherfucker,
my phone was dead.
I held a funeral
for that motherfucker.
I had people giving speeches
in remembrance
of the time
when my phone was alive.
But it is back to life.
It has resurrected,
and the phone-a is a-ringing
off of the hook-a.
Calling you
motherfucking van Gogh
with words, baby.
They calling you Walt Disney.
They want to freeze
your motherfucking brain
when you die.
But you was acting like
a little fuck-boy for a minute.
And I had to admit...
true genius takes true guidance,
takes true pushing.
Let me tell you something.
- Please, tell me something.
- Moondog.
Tell me something.
You up for a motherfucking
Pulitzer.
My book's up for a Pulitzer?
- Pulitzer.
- Ah!
Minnie-boo, you hear this?
Thank you.
And now the prize
for outstanding poetry.
It is with great honor
that I introduce to you
Mr. Moondog.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
I had a lot in my life,
but I always had
this feeling like,
when I left...
...no one gonna remember me.
But knowing you,
being a part of what you did...
...maybe that means
something now.
I want to thank you.
You know what I liked the most
about being rich?
Mm?
You can just...
be horrible to people,
and they just have to take it.
This next poem is, uh,
one I wrote at 3:00 a.m.,
coming down off of a two-day
acid trip in the Virgin Islands.
It's called
"The Beautiful Poem."
"I go to bed in Havana
"thinking about you.
"Pissing a few
moments ago, I...
"I looked down at my penis
"with affection.
"Knowing it has been inside you
"twice today...
...makes me feel beautiful."
- Go, Moondog!
- Moondog!
Ah...
I have to admit I didn't think
you could do it, Dad.
No?
But you managed
to pull it off somehow.
Sweetie,
told you don't ever bet
against the Moondog.
I'm just so happy you
finally dumped Limp-Dick.
Oh. I know.
- He sucked.
- Right?
Yeah.
You unlocked a fortune.
The money is yours.
Your complete
inheritance is all yours.
Congratulations.
Exactly. Perfect. Listen.
I want it all in cash, man.
What was that?
Cash, man. C-A-S-H, cash.
All greenbacks.
I don't want you to put a penny
of that stuff in the bank.
You know, I don't trust
those Illuminati
motherfuckers.
Now, here's what
you're gonna do.
I want you to buy me a sailboat.
All right?
Like, a 150-, 200-footer,
something really nice,
preferably vintage,
and I want you
to name that boat Success,
after my old friend
Captain Wack,
and then you're gonna put
the rest of the cash
stacked in that sailboat,
and I want you
to sail it down here to me.
That's over $50 million
in cash, Moondog.
All right, don't fuck it up.
She's gonna want to marry me
now that I'm rich, right, huh?
That's right.
What do you think
about that, huh?
Cash in a boat.
We could do whatever we want
or nothing at all.
- Yeah, mon.
- There she is.
That's beautiful.
She's awesome, man.
Awesome boat.
Got great shapes in the cargo.
There's $46 million on board.
Man...
we're gonna buy ourselves
so much weed.
Mmm.
What do you think about that?
You know what I want to do?
I want to have a big fucking
firework show, man,
invite all my friends
from the Keys.
None of that sparkler bullshit
that impresses lesbians,
pregnant women and babies.
No, no, no, let's-let's Valhalla
this motherfucker,
you know what I mean?
Raise the dead.
- Make it awesome for Minnie.
- Boom.
Work it, Moondog.
