NETFLIX PRESENTS
What are we even doing here? Look at us.
Other YouTubers are staying
in Alaçatı for free,
and they're getting paid.
And look at what we're doing.
Let's just do it and leave.
What about the video?
After we're done, Samet. Come on.
All right, man. I'm ready.
Come on. Please,
let's not waste any time.
Mrs. Gülseren, let's go if you're ready.
If you're going to begin, I'll get ready.
Now, introduce yourself if you will.
Where did you hear about them?
- About what?
- My outstanding skills.
- It's what we do, ma'am.
- Nice answer.
I do things, too,
but only if people listen.
Can you really multiply four-digit numbers
in your head, ma'am?
- Without pen and paper?
- Yes, I can.
Without using anything
but the back of my hand.
- I don't get it.
- I'd be surprised if you did.
- I respect someone your age, but...
- My age?
What's wrong with my age? Am I a relic?
You know what?
I think you should call me Gülseren.
Because that's my name. I'm Gülseren.
"Gülseren" means
someone who lays down roses,
and "gül" means "rose."
It's known as the nightingale's favorite.
That might ring a bell.
Mrs. Gülseren,
we have to wrap up by tonight.
- Let's begin if you're ready.
- You're so hasty.
Very. No, I'm not ready.
I haven't even shown you my album.
- What album?
- Hang on.
Where was it?
I was born in this mansion.
This is where I met them
for the first time.
Who?
The fireflies.
Take care.

Our NATO membership is becoming certain…
INQUIRY INTO THE COMMUNIST PARTY
MEMORANDUM ON MIDDLE EASTERN COMMAND
COMMUNIST FROM İZMİR APPREHENDED HERE
It's all Arabic stations. Look at this.
Another one. You seem to be enjoying
selling all your oil to the imperialists.
You'll get what's coming to you.
Another one.
Maybe it's on the long wave.
Hi.
Hey!
- Hi!
- Hi.
Stop messing with it.
What are you looking for?
The news.
There.
He said "Stalin." Did you hear that?
Some people are so lucky.
I bet this newsman has even
seen Stalin with his own eyes.
I doubt it.
I think everyone who has seen him is dead.
What does that even mean?
Why are you listening to this?
Are you crazy? Do you speak Russian?
It's the USSR station, Nazif.
And?
And rather than hearing lies in Turkish,
I prefer hearing the truth in Russian.
How do you know
if the Russian version is true?
Are you insane?
Dear God, please answer me.
Why is my brother
the silliest man on this mortal plane?
What did our family do to deserve this?
Nazif, I really don't want to argue.
We can argue in Russian if you want.
You don't understand
either language anyway.
- …Comrade-ovsky…
- "Comrade-ovsky?"
Da, da.
Listen to me! Enough with the communism.
Not so loud!
There are informants everywhere.
I don't care.
I support the People's Party.
I can be as loud as I want.
- Brother… Brother!
- Hey, everyone! There's a commie in here!
All right. Cut it out.
- Stop playing.
- Commie!
- This is not something you joke about.
- Oh, you…
- Dear God.
- Unbelievable.
All right. Cut it out.
Are we supposed to follow the proletariat
like we don't have better things to do?
What's your solution?
Should everyone sell silverberries?
You've been working for nothing.
You'd think so.
Silverberries are very promising.
- Is that so?
- Yes. They last long.
They don't go bad easily.
This is a good time
to be in the food industry.
People are hungry.
Thanks to your İsmet Pasha.
You ingrate.
You'd be dead rather than hungry
if it weren't for him.
If he had got us into the war,
you'd be on the front right now.
- So should people just eat silverberries?
- Yes, they should.
Business takes courage, Mr. Hazım.
- That's what you said about sugar.
- That was also true.
If Kürşat hadn't idiotically left
the merchandise laying around
because he had to go to the mosque,
and if it hadn't rained
right there and then…
And if it hadn't melted the sugar…
- I'll hit you in the head!
- All right!
- Hazım!
- İzzet?
Hazım, listen.
Oh, Nazif.
- İclal may deliver tonight.
- What?
She's having contractions.
Hazım, get the midwife, Mrs. Sürme.
- I can't. I have a meeting.
- What meeting?
What do you think?
- He must be up to something again.
- These matters are above you, İzzet.
She is about to give birth! Just go.
It's not a big deal.
Everyone's giving birth
in third-world countries.
Hazım, go get the midwife.
Then you can go.
I can't. I have a meeting.
Assalamu alaikum, folks.
Good afternoon.
"Good afternoon"?
What's that supposed to mean?
I bring him Allah's greetings,
and he replies with "Good afternoon."
- Your sister is in labor.
- Really?
What a miracle of God
that we mortals can't even grasp.
He bestows life upon a tiny seed.
Kürşat, stop it. She's just giving birth.
Just tell him on my behalf
that I haven't ever spoken to him,
nor will I ever speak to him.
God help me.
You tell people you're an atheist
but then ask for God's help.
I said she's in labor.
Someone should just get the midwife.
Oh no. It's the contractions.
Guys, just go get her!
- You do it!
- Why aren't you going?
- I have a meeting!
- Just go already!
- Come on!
- Kürşat! Go get the midwife.
Hazım, you go to hell.
- Come on.
- Just go.
You smell awful like usual.
- Did you drink the rose cologne?
- Stop it!
- You immoral, insensitive heathen.
- Just go.
- Stop.
- You infidel.
Hazım Biröz?
That's me.
You're coming with me.
- All right.
- Search the place.
- Stop watching, people!
- I'll help you out.
The police raided everywhere back then.
Clubs, organizations…
They arrested everyone they could find.
NEW CHAPTER IN THE COMMUNIST INVESTIGATION
I was born on such a night.
According to Aunt İzzet,
that's when the fireflies first appeared.
Have you ever seen fireflies?
I haven't.
You can't. They won't let you.
Not everyone can see them anyway.
I don't get it.
You're lucky, then.
You'd be so lonely if you did.
Did we make it?
- Are we too late?
- No, come in.
Hurry up.
You're going to be all right.
It's okay, honey. Calm down.
- Come on. Breathe.
- Breathe.
We've been waiting for this day
for years, honey.
You're almost there.
Here's the first photo
of our small family.
Ready.
Done.
My sweet daughter has a photo now.
Don't you, honey?
All right, Mr. Nazif. When are you paying?
God, you don't have to be so direct.
Have some manners.
You haven't paid us anything
for months, Mr. Nazif.
I gave you a sack of silverberries.
Mr. Nazif!
I told you, never utter
the word "silverberry" in my presence.
Don't talk to me like that
in front of people.
This was the last photo, Mr. Nazif.
I can't pay my rent
with silverberries, you know.
Give them back, then. You ingrate.
Stop talking about them!
You resigned from the civil service
and got into a ridiculous business!
You're driving me insane.
God, give me patience.
Please, God!
If your needless photo shoot is done,
let me put the baby down in her stroller.
Come here, you. There we go.
Why do you keep avoiding
having your photo taken, İzzet?
Why do you keep having your photo taken?
Because I don't want to be forgotten.
- And I don't want to be remembered.
- Come on, you two.
Let's go.
So?
So what?
How did it go?
How did what go?
- You're broke, aren't you?
- İclal!
Of course not. I mean…
We're not exactly broke,
but you know how silverberries...
He keeps saying it.
You're driving me crazy.
How can I talk about silverberries
without saying "silverberries"?
Enough, Nazif.
There was this buyer
who was supposed to buy out
our entire stock.
He was going to take them east.
Erzurum is short of silverberries.
Nowhere on the entire planet
is short of silverberries.
You're not letting me explain.
You're doing this on purpose
to drive me insane.
- Seriously!
- Enough. You're embarrassing us.
I'm not the one who's embarrassing us.
So?
Nazif? Sister?
- Assalamu alaikum.
- Alaikumu assalam.
Bismillah…
- Oh God.
- The baby is sleeping!
- Welcome, Kürşat.
- Thanks.
- Where have you been?
- Do you want me to tell you?
I can say that I'm basically floating
about 30 to 35 centimeters
above the ground.
What is it? Did he come?
Yes, he did come.
And he took the community
right up to the sky as soon as he came.
Up to the sky? Who are you talking about?
A new imam has been
appointed to our mosque.
Such a holy man!
He's so inspirational.
I can't even begin to describe him.
Think about it this way.
The prayer was over, but everyone stayed.
Just open the store.
I was talking about the buyer.
What buyer? For silverberries?
No one has bought a single one.
- So we're done?
- Exactly.
- Look at this mess, for God's sake.
- Put them out.
I'm going to go insane.
Hi, everyone!
It's me.
Hazım?
Hazım! It's so great to have you back.
- Welcome.
- Welcome.
Thank God.
- Come here.
- Brother!
- Welcome.
- Thank God.
- How are you?
- I'm okay.
- Welcome.
- Thanks.
Good to have you back, Mr. Hazım.
Thanks, Mr. Kürşat.
Hazım, you've lost a lot of weight.
You know how prisons are.
You embrace it for the cause.
Six months in prison,
no change in attitude.
- Did you say something?
- No.
I was just praying by myself.
- Good.
- Come on.
My brother is out of prison.
We have to have some rakija tonight.
- Right?
- Sure.
Kürşat, go buy us
some rakija and some snacks.
- Come on.
- What?
Rakija?
I'd rather dig my own grave
and lie in it, Nazif.
Wow, Kürşat. Don't talk like that.
- Why shouldn't I?
- Think about it like this.
Even if you dig the grave and lie in it,
someone has to bury you.
- For God's sake...
- Just this once. You can get it.
What's up?
Again?
Hazım Biröz?
That's me.
Officer, what's going on, for God's sake?
- This must be a mistake.
- Hang on.
- What are the charges? Wait.
- Nazif.
Go have your rakija in prison,
you heathen.
- Officer!
- Hang on, man.
This is ridiculous.
You started talking at six months?
They say I didn't just start talking.
I was basically a chatterbox.
And then?
Then, I was literate
by the time I was two.
And at three, I knew
how to do mathematical calculations.
I would've loved to be
your run-of-the-mill idiot,
but I'm not.
How was school for you?
People are so mean at that age.
Maybe I was the one who was arrogant.
I'm not sure.
Tell me, Gülseren.
What do we call a piece of land
that's surrounded by sea on three sides?
I don't know. We'd call it
"surrounded" if we were the police.
Shut up!
All right.
What do we call it when it's
surrounded by sea on four sides?
Give me the cheekiest answer
you can come up with.
That's called an island, ma'am.
No need for cheekiness.
What are you trying to do?
Are you testing the limits of my patience?
I'm not testing anything, ma'am.
You're the one who keeps asking.
See, teachers ask us the sum
of the interior angles of a triangle.
But I'm trying to figure out the sum
of the interior suffering of a human.
Yours, for example.
The entire school knows
your husband is cheating.
You secretly cry
in the bathroom at recess.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Don't do it.
You keep testing us here
because you can't question him at home.
You're the most disrespectful,
the most arrogant,
the most wicked student I have ever seen.
You'll answer for this at the committee.
You'll pay for insulting me.
You…
You're a demon.
Demon!
Shut up!
- Spoiled brats.
- Us?
I said stop laughing! Stop!
What's my score, ma'am?
Ma'am...
Come in.
Sir, you asked to see me?
- Welcome, Mr. Nazif.
- Thanks.
Take a seat.
Honey.
Sir.
Our geography teacher, Mrs. Mualla.
Our maths teacher, Mr. Hurşit.
Pleasure.
We'll have the pleasure soon enough.
Excuse me?
Mr. Headmaster will explain.
You'll understand soon.
If you'll excuse me.
Of course, sir.
Mr. Nazif,
I've had a long career,
and this is one of its
most important and special days.
I'm sure my colleagues feel the same.
Absolutely.
What's wrong, sir?
Sir, you see,
we're making the biggest contribution
to our educational system
since the big educational reform
by expelling your daughter, Gülseren.
- Bravo, sir. Very good call.
- Bravo.
Hang on. You're expelling her? Why?
You hear that? He's asking why.
He's asking why!
Sir, your daughter is unruly,
rebellious, and disobedient.
Your daughter is a brunette!
- Your daughter is...
- Disrespectful, insolent!
Aggressive and a biter!
Gülseren, are they telling the truth?
What did they say, Dad? I wasn't…
I was thinking about something else.
Gülseren.
You know I can't listen
to serious people for long, Dad.
Mr. Nazif, please leave.
Get out of my office and my school!
She says she can't listen to us.
Did you hear that?
We did, sir. Calm down, please.
I'm sorry, Dad.
I'm not one to give up on my daughter
just because there are complaints,
but you have to know
that this can't go on, Gülseren.
You'll always have someone
bossing you around.
A boss, a teacher, maybe even a husband.
You have to learn to shut up and get by.
Can we get ice cream, Dad?
Perfect.
You want to celebrate
your expulsion with ice cream.
We don't have to celebrate.
We can have it regretfully.
- Do you regret it?
- Yes.
How much?
So much.
Why are we having ice cream, then?
It tastes best when you're sad, Dad.
- Can we?
- Yeah.
Vanilla.
All right, vanilla.
I'll have the sad father-y kind.
There you go, honey.
There you go.
- How much is it?
- Half a lira.
Thanks.
Dad!
Having your father as your best friend
is the greatest fortune ever.
He was my best friend.
He was the one who got me
ice cream when I was expelled.
My mother was responsible
for the beatings.
God sent you to punish me, right?
You rascal!
- Mom, stop!
- No one can save you now.
- Dad!
- This girl is killing me.
- How dare you talk back to your teachers?
- Go. Run.
How dare you get expelled?
- Let me go. I'll kill her!
- Hit me instead.
Let me kill her.
I gave her life. I'll take it.
You're hurting her self-esteem.
She's a young woman now.
What self-esteem?
- She's a disgrace!
- Just breathe.
- I won't!
- Come on.
Who is he?
An unlucky young man
who wanted to marry me.
He wouldn't have wanted it
if he knew what would happen to him.
What do you think, İclal?
Doesn't he look like a prince?
I don't know, Sürme. I'm not so sure.
A prince? Him?
You can tell he's a moron from the photo.
Don't talk like that.
He's from
the most esteemed family in Beypazarı.
Everyone there
knows the name Tipiyanoğulları.
- An esteemed family, you say?
- Of course. They're merchants.
His grandfather brought
the first forks to Beypazarı.
They used their hands before that.
So that's their accomplishment.
They invented the fork.
Don't talk like that.
They started with forks
and ended up with a fortune.
They built a big business.
First spoons, then sieves and strainers…
They became big.
So they sell kitchenware. Interesting.
Congratulations, İclal. You're lucky.
Your daughter is marrying
into a rich family of inventors.
It'll all be done by the weekend.
- This weekend?
- What?
They want it to be quick.
They need to get back soon.
Time flies by.
They grow up so fast.
She was just born into my arms.
That's very normal, Sürme,
since you were the midwife.
Of course she was born into your arms.
So they'll take Gülseren to Beypazarı?
That's what it looks like.
You can't stop it, İclal.
They always fly away when the time comes.
Why is she so happy?
You'd think
she's the one who'd be getting laid.
- Shut up!
- What?
I'm home.
If it isn't our neighborhood's
head of gossip,
and everyone's midwife, Sürme.
Welcome, ma'am. Let me have your hand.
When did she come?
I want to figure out when she'll leave.
Shut up!
All right, Mom.
What's the latest gossip, ma'am?
Let me tell you the latest event
in the neighborhood first.
Just because I'm a nice person.
I just saw it. Your daughter was
showing her tits to Abdi the grocer.
- What?
- Don't panic, ma'am.
- Abdi loved her tits.
- What?
- Why else would he touch them?
- What?
Gülseren!
Then they went down to the basement.
I think he wanted to see the rest.
Oh my God!
- Neighbors, help me!
- Oh no.
- We have no honor now!
- Sürme!
- Saliha!
- Your honor is in the basement.
Oh God. Saliha!
Oh no.
Let me have my tea.
I should just kill you, Gülseren.
- I have to.
- No, İclal.
What did I do? It wasn't my tits.
- She's still talking! Don't help her.
- Shut up, you!
- Enough already!
- Calm down.
How dare you talk like that?
Have you lost your mind?
I just made it up, Mom.
Just to save you two from her.
What? It was a lie?
Not completely.
- He didn't like her tits.
- I swear…
- What do Saliha and a cow have in common?
- What?
Both have their tits between their legs.
I'll kick your butt
if you say "tit" one more time.
- Tit.
- That was so good.
I hate her. All she does is gossip.
Bravo, İzzet. Bravo.
Keep enabling this insolent brat.
Oh, please.
Why do you have a flashlight?
It's daytime!
I finally figured out
how to talk to the fireflies.
Auntie, they always dance
when I flash the light.
Dear God, please knock some sense
into my daughter's head.
She's been talking about fireflies
ever since she was born.
Honey, you can't talk to fireflies.
What's the problem, Mom?
Some talk to dogs, some talk to flowers.
And you guys sometimes speak to Sürme.
What were you even talking about?
That's a good question.
She's asking you.
It was definitely about me.
What was it, Auntie?
What was it, Mom?
It was nothing!
- She was just…
- She was just what?
Gülseren, someone's asking for your hand.
My hand?
Why would they do that?
Why?
For your hand in marriage.
What do you mean?
So someone's just going to come here
and say, "We're sorry to bother you,
but our son has reached maturity."
"Unfortunately, we don't have
any girls for him to bed."
"If you have a spare one…"
- Is that what's going to happen?
- I swear my daughter is insane.
She's so insane you can't talk to her.
What? Isn't it funny, Mom?
For God's sake, you can ask your neighbor
if they have sugar or salt but a daughter?
Gülseren, his family is very wealthy.
They're the most esteemed family
in Samanpazarı.
- Beypazarı.
- Right. Beypazarı.
They're the ones who brought
the first spoons and sieves there.
Sieves?
- Was it forks?
- And they're inventing strainers soon.
What are you even talking about?
Are they seriously going to do this?
Gülseren, you've come of age.
You need to get married.
What do you say?
What can I say?
The family has made a decision.
I cannot argue.
What? Are you serious, Gülseren?
Bravo, Gülseren. Congratulations.
There's my clever girl.
I need to prepare.
Bravo.
Gülseren, are you serious?
Let me handle it, Auntie.
I'll handle it.
Here they are. Get up, Nazif.
Get up. Hurry.
- Put on your jacket. Stop making a mess.
- All right.
Slow down.
Slow down!
Where is she?
There we go. Bismillah. Come on.
Slow down! Button your jacket.
Who were you looking for?
Me, right?
- Excuse me?
- That was a joke. Never mind.
- Welcome.
- Welcome, all.
- Hello.
- Welcome.
- Hi.
- Welcome.
Welcome, son.
Welcome, son.
Come in, son.
Welcome.
Please, have a seat.
- Again, welcome.
- Thanks.
Maytap, did you see the dresser?
It's amazing.
- These are hard to find.
- Is that so?
Is it mulberry?
- Excuse me?
- The dresser. Is it mulberry?
I'm not sure.
Maybe try examining it closer.
You know, mull over it.
But not for too long
since it may not be mulberry.
- Gülseren.
- I love you too, Mom.
Let's sit down.
- Let's, please.
- Let's sit down.
- Have a seat. There you go, son.
- I'll take those.
- I'll take them.
- İzzet.
Let me know if you decide to sell it.
It's worth a lot.
Of course. Please.
Let's introduce ourselves, Kafur.
So, Sürme is an old family friend of ours.
We're very close.
We were chatting one day,
and we talked about
how our son should get married.
- Then I...
- We asked her help.
We asked where we could find a girl.
Since she's a midwife,
she knows
where the good stuff is, naturally.
So we were talking about
how our son should get married...
Excuse me, does your son have a name?
You keep calling him "our son."
Does he have a name,
or should we make one up?
Of course he has a name.
My name is Servet. My middle name is…
Mom, what was my middle name?
- Bekir, honey.
- What are you talking about?
It's Bekir. Don't you question me.
It wasn't Bekir, Mom.
It started with an M.
Right, Dad?
How would I know? I just call you Suat.
He does.
Well…
Who cares about first names anyway?
It's the last name that counts.
See, foreigners always call each other
by their last names.
- Isn't that so, Mr. Gaffur?
- It's Kafur, sir.
What was your name?
- Nazif, sir.
- That's it!
- What?
- My middle name is Nazif.
Or something like that.
Son, your middle name is Bekir.
How much did this sofa cost, Mr. Kazım?
- It's Nazif, sir.
- Nice. You got it cheap.
That's not what I asked. What a buffoon.
Excuse me, sir?
I'm saying if the cost was "Nazif,"
you got it cheap.
This won't cost
a cent below "Mahmut" nowadays.
No.
You called me "Kazım,"
so I corrected you, Mr. Gavur.
It's Kafur.
You're being ridiculous, Mom.
That's Dad's name.
- What did I say?
- Well!
Can we please stop talking about names?
I'm fed up with it.
- Who's "Fedup?"
- My husband.
Gülseren!
There you go.
There you go.
- Honey? Gülseren?
- What a stupid question.
Dad, this guy isn't human. He's an object.
A dresser, even.
Mrs. Mehtap,
how much did the dresser cost?
It's not Mehtap, dear. It's Maytap.
I know. I thought your name
was horrible and corrected it.
Gülseren, make some coffee for our guests.
All right. I'll leave this right here.
- Should we get to the point, Kafur?
- All right.
Okay, Maytap.
All right.
Now, Mr. Rüstem,
marriage is an enterprise,
just like business enterprises.
The word "enterprise"
is even derived from there.
If you invest well,
you'll surely profit.
But you have to get your goods
from somewhere reliable.
Let's say you went and got yourself
a lousy girl from a shitty family.
What happens? You lose. Am I right, sir?
- Yes. Right, honey?
- What is this jerk talking about?
Hush, İzzet.
Then, you're left with the goods
with no buyer.
What are you going to do with it?
Right, sir?
For example, this carpet...
What a carpet though.
Just look at this carpet.
Isn't it Persian?
Yes, it's an antique Persian carpet.
An heirloom from my husband's grandpa.
It was gifted to him by Sultan Abdulaziz.
He was the sultan's toothpickman.
What-man now?
We don't like
talking about this stuff, but…
But we have ancestral ties
to the royal family.
Back in those days,
whenever the sultan had
something stuck in his teeth,
they called my husband's grandfather.
To pick it out?
Exactly.
Considering how much meat was
consumed by the sultan back then…
Here's the coffee.
- Oh, honey.
- There you go, sir.
Thanks.
If you want more foam,
I'll have to spit in it.
She's just kidding.
- There you go.
- It's a joke.
- Daddy.
- That's my girl.
Don't be fooled by
them calling me "a girl."
- I'm a woman.
- Honey!
That's why I admire these people, Dad.
No proper family
would accept a divorcée nowadays.
- A divorcée?
- What?
Oh, they didn't tell you?
I was married twice.
What are you talking about, Gülseren?
Mr. Tayfun, don't mind her.
She's just too excited.
It's Kafur, ma'am!
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Sercan.
When I got married the second time,
I was still with my first husband.
I told Salih openly.
I said, "Salih, since it's our honeymoon,
I still love Bedri so much.
Let's invite him. We'll get a big room."
I also liked posing nude back then.
I told him to invite Bedri,
so we could have our photos taken.
Don't you faint, Mom.
I'm getting to the best part.
I'm on a roll here.
So we were on our honeymoon.
They showed us our room.
Then, what do you know,
my ex Fuat walks by.
So I was married to Salih,
I still loved Bedri so much,
but I also had feelings for Fuat.
Nazif, kill her!
Get up, Kafur.
Don't take her seriously. She's kidding.
This is such a scandal.
- Get up, Servet!
- Stop.
Why did God give me such a child?
Don't you faint in front of the guests.
Perverts!
- Honey.
- Also, there's no way this is mulberry.
It's just oak, Mr. Tezcan.
It's Nazif, sir!
What? Nazif?
This is not even worth a Şaban.
Enough already.
You can't have my daughter. Just leave.
I just remembered,
my last boyfriend's name was also Şaban.
- Shut up!
- They didn't hear me. Too bad.
- I'm going to kill her!
- Stop!
- Mom, stop. Dad!
- Don't you dare stop me.
Don't touch me.
I gave life to her, and I'm taking it!
- Sit down, for God's sake.
- Why should I?
- Let me go.
- It's all right. Calm down.
It's okay.
Muharrem.
Finally. My middle name is Muharrem.
Fuck off, you moron!
I swear to God…
- It's okay, honey.
- I'm going to kill her!
- Let me go!
- Hi, everyone!
No hugs? I'm out of prison.
Don't worry. They won't take me back.
I got acquitted this time.
- Wait a second.
- I'm going to kill her! Just let me go!
- Sit down.
- Let me go!
- Breathe.
- What happened?
Don't worry about it.
Your mother and I have decided.
You're either studying or getting married.
Can't I do both, Dad?
How are you going to
attend classes with a baby?
So I can't do both.
Is being a woman a punishment, Dad?
Oh, honey.
Oh, Daddy.
You could be anything you want
if you weren't so rebellious.
But no one laughs, Dad.
I crack a joke.
The kids laugh, but the teachers don't.
You go there to learn, honey,
not to make people laugh.
Can't I have fun and study, Dad?
Oh, my baby girl. I have no idea.
The intelligent always
get punished in this country.
We worship seriousness.
We kill fun and pleasure
whenever we encounter them.
I love you, Dad.
- Oh, Daddy.
- Oh, Gülseren.
Dad, can you see them?
See what?
The fireflies.
Of course. Of course I do.
That's my dad.
There are so many!
See? Look at them!
- Love you, Dad.
- Love you, honey.
My poor mother was bedridden for a week.
She didn't talk to us for a while.
Everyone at the house
started thinking I was crazy.
Uncle Kürşat knew
exactly the person who could heal me.
Look at it.
Calm down. Sit down.
God help us.
This is nonsense. She's not crazy.
You'll drive her crazy
if you keep at it though.
İzzet, for God's sake, stay out of it.
We're ready, dear. Come here.
- Spit, dear.
- What?
Spit in the bowl, dear.
- I won't, Mom.
- Gülseren!
- I seriously won't.
- Don't anger the hodja.
- Just spit.
- Why would I with everyone watching?
The hodja said so.
- For God's sake.
- Look, dear.
The bodily fluid from your mouth
will mix with the water.
Then, we'll be able to determine
where the djinni are hiding in your body.
There's no such practice in Islam.
İzzet, please shut up.
I know the Qur'an word for word.
There's no such thing.
- He's talking nonsense.
- Spit, dear.
- Spit, Gülseren.
- I'll do it.
I'll do it, ma'am.
- Go ahead.
- A mouthful, honey.
Let it all come out, dear.
What is it?
- I can't take this anymore.
- Just go.
Look at it. Just look.
I'm going to puke.
Look at the dark corners.
Your mental faculties
have been significantly perverted.
Sir, what if those fireflies are
the visible form of those djinni?
Of course they are.
You know, they're made of fire.
- Poor girl.
- God forbid.
God!
- I feel something.
- Gülseren?
- Gülseren.
- The hodja is right.
They're whispering things to me.
- What are they saying?
- They're calling me, sir.
I'm coming!
The hodja? Yes, he's here.
The bowl?
They want the bowl.
There you go.
Yeah?
I can't. How can I?
Sir, they want me to...
God damn it!
What kind of a person are you?
Gülseren!
Get her. I'm going to…
THE LAW OF THE BORDER
You insist on being crazy.
I swear no one will marry you, honey.
I got you the best hodja there is.
What else can I do?
I've taken you to a hundred places.
I did what I could.
- For God's sake.
- What? You don't like anything.
Daddy, how are you?
- Like shit.
- Why? What happened?
The salt business is over.
Salt? What salt?
You were so against the silverberries,
I invested what we had in salt.
So?
So our truck plunged
into the sea in İzmit.
The sea?
How can a person be so unlucky?
So?
You're going to kill me
if you keep saying "So?" so much.
We have nothing left, all right?
- So?
- For God's sake, stop it.
It's over. We're broke.
Thanks to you, Mr. Nazif. Well done.
It fell into the sea.
What could I have done?
Mr. Nazif, from now on,
if you ever mention
silverberries, salt, or sugar again,
I swear I'll divorce you.
Give me those. Enough is enough.
For God's sake.
You can only say "flour" from now on.
That was the moment Dad broke down.
He always had hope up until then.
He was going to succeed in trade
and get us back on our feet.
It didn't work out.
My father's dreams melted away
in the salty seas that day.
I made you a cheese sandwich.
Love you, Dad.
How I wish I was the old me.
The old me would never
let her do this to you.
You are the same person, Dad.
Don't brood over it.
No, honey.
I'm just a shadow of my old self.
- Did you have rakija?
- Shut up.
- Hush. I'm trying to tell you something.
- All right.
Look, honey.
A man needs to fulfill his dreams.
Otherwise, he's only half a man.
I'm no good at running a business.
The civil service is all I know.
That bastard Şahin
scammed me with the silverberries.
I just want to sell the mansion
so that we can get an apartment.
I can't convince your mother.
She keeps saying that she'll die here.
Apparently, the descendants
of the great sultan's toothpickman
can't live in an apartment.
Daddy, listen to me.
You're my one and only father.
You're my hero.
Oh, honey.
What I'm saying is…
forgive me, honey.
My father provided me with a good life.
But I couldn't make it better for you.
Don't drink rakija.
It makes you broody.
He first became withdrawn.
Then he just wouldn't leave his room.
And then, after many long
and broody nights of drinking…
It was Wednesday
when I first met loneliness.
Have you ever seen it up close?
What do you mean?
I have.
It's nothing like they described.
I was expecting something beefier.
Beefier? What do you mean?
I just knew.
I don't know how, but I knew.
It was no surprise
that it happened on a Wednesday.
Because I always feel lonelier
on Wednesday mornings.
Right in the middle
of a week of going nowhere.
All alone.
Bismillah.
God, give him health.
God, please save him.
Nazif?
Hazım, he's not breathing.
- Go get the doctor.
- Okay.
Nazif?
Nazif?
- Nazif!
- Nazif?
- Nazif?
- Nazif.
Nazif?
Nazif?
I guess there are no fireflies tonight.
They don't like the lights.
They said it's too bright.
"No one sees us," they said.
They're right.
Honey…
I'm leaving now.
You're leaving because of me, aren't you?
Because I'm crazy.
But I'll work on it. I'll be better.
I'll cut my ties with the fireflies too.
You're not crazy.
Sometimes being smart is a heavier burden.
Dad, you're the only friend I have.
Can't you stay?
Can't you stay for a while?
We can both go afterwards.
I have to go, Gülseren.
But you know
that I'll always be by your side.
I'm not just saying it. I mean it.
I will always be in your heart and mind.
If I'm in your mind,
I'm by your side, right?
Look.
Think of it this way.
What if I were by your side
but not in your heart?
Daddy.
Well…
I'll be going now.
I love you so much.
Dad…
Dear God…
I'd like to have a word with you.
But can we do it in Turkish?
I don't speak Arabic.
But you're our God,
and I think you speak every language.
I'd like to talk about
how you took my father.
I hope you won't get mad.
Because I hear you don't like
talking about such topics.
But…
But don't you think you rushed it a bit?
I think he could've stayed with us
for a little while longer.
But you must have your reasons.
We can't grasp God's reasoning, they say.
Do you realize how many people
speak on your behalf?
I'm sure you realize, but…
Take good care of him, will you?
He's bad at business, you know.
He'd argue otherwise, but…
But don't put him in a business position.
He's a good civil servant.
Just give him a desk job.
I'm so sorry.
I'm meddling again, aren't I?
God, he's a very good person.
I'm pretty sure you'll put him in Heaven,
and that means I'll never see him again.
Since, you know, I'm crazy.
So I probably won't get into Heaven.
All right. I'm sorry.
I'll get to the point.
But I have to ask you something
about me for the last time.
I know you'll be mad,
but I do have to ask.
God, what am I supposed to do now?
Nazif!
Nazif!
Nazif!
God rest his soul.
After my father's death,
things went properly downhill.
ASTRONAUTS LAND ON THE MOON
Then came 12th March.
The '70s, the infighting.
Needless to say,
Uncle Hazım was in prison again.

Stand together…
Brothers were fighting each other
across the nation.
Is it more surprising
for a person to kill their sibling
than for them to kill someone
they've never even seen before?
COLLEGE STUDENTS FIGHTING POLICE ARRESTED
- Who's this?
- Veli.
You know, there's nothing like
believing in something.
But it's always better
to believe in something lucrative.
But that's not what Veli did.
Such a good man.
If you don't know about business,
why get into politics, right?
What are you doing here again?
Aren't you tired of ruining our wall?
- Leave. Get lost.
- All right, ma'am. It's okay.
It's not okay! You ruined it. Leave.
- All right.
- Take all your crap.
Like you're going to save the nation.
Shut up! Don't talk back to me.
WE WILL BUILD
AN INDEPENDENT AND DEMOCRATIC TURKEY
You're driving me insane.
What the Soviets did in Afghanistan
is blatant occupation.
No other way to put it.
Their internal dynamics brought a demand,
and the Soviets just met that.
What are you talking about?
Did the Afghans say,
"Bring your tanks and bomb everywhere"?
They demanded socialism.
So if they'd demanded capitalism,
the US would've sent tanks?
- You're spinning it.
- You're being sectarian.
Your structural approach isn't scientific.
Guys.
Hello. Silverberries?
What now?
- Do you want silverberries?
- No, Gülseren. Thanks.
Would you get mad if I told you
Afghanistan is none of your business?
- What are you talking about?
- Exactly this.
- We have other things to do, Veli.
- Stop pestering me, Nuran.
- Hi, Gülseren.
- What's up, Veli?
- Nuran, silverberries?
- No, thanks.
- What is it this time?
- "Down with…"
How does painting our wall help?
I don't know.
But nothing happens if I don't.
I'm going to charge you for this.
You're supposedly against
advertisements, but it's all you do.
"Salvation" costs 50 liras.
"People's Salvation" is 100.
I'd be rich
if ten others like you use the wall.
You'll get nothing.
This wall is now public.
Is that so?
I am the public, but no one told me.
I'm living in Camus' The Stranger,
thanks to you.
If you catch my drift.
When will you be done?
You promised we'd go to the movies.
- Nuran, you know I'm busy.
- Which movie?
Ayhan Işık's.
Yılmaz Güney's.
- Isn't there a movie with both of them?
- Güney lives for the cause.
- The other's just an actor.
- We saw that one last week though.
But you didn't get it.
How was I supposed to?
You didn't let me watch.
Nuran, stop it.
Have you read the book I gave you?
Gülseren, get inside.
Why are you talking to anarchists?
Anarchists? It's Veli and Nuran.
Oh, Veli?
Mrs. İclal.
Veli, why are you ruining our wall, son?
I'll tell your mom.
And I'll tell Hazım.
You're the sister-in-law
of an esteemed revolutionary.
- This is not like you.
- Shut up.
You were running around
in short shorts just a few years ago.
When did you grow up so much
that you're talking back to me?
- Ma'am...
- Come on, Veli!
I'm talking to her here!
Son, look. This will only hurt you.
You're still a kid.
Don't do this to yourself.
Think of your parents.
Plus, the wall is a mess, for God's sake!
We wake up to another
ridiculous line every day.
You know, the other day,
they wrote, "The sorcerer will pay."
Ridiculous.
We wrote "torturer"!
Some fascist changed it.
- Gülseren…
- I was just coughing.
- I was!
- It was you, wasn't it?
- No wonder they call you "Nutty."
- Veli!
Veli, take this.
Get me two loaves of bread.
- Take it. Come on.
- I'm busy, Mrs. İclal.
So be it, Veli. So be it.
And they say they support "the people"!
Well, as one of those people,
I asked for some bread.
What happened to supporting us
in our struggle to earn our bread?
- All right, ma'am. How many loaves?
- Two, well-baked.
Get it from the Başak Store.
- No! He's a fascist.
- But he has good bread.
And how is he a fascist?
He just stutters a bit. You're crazy.
Not stuttering is not a requirement
for being a fascist.
He's a fascist. We know. He's been warned.
He wasn't stuttering before we warned him.
I guess he was scared.
Such attitude. You rascal.
Go get my bread!
- Hurry up.
- Hold this. I'll be right back.
- So, Mrs. İclal…
- Yeah?
- Can I get a pack of smokes?
- What? We don't smoke.
Is that so? Well, we'll smoke them, then.
You rascal. All right.
But only cheap ones.
I'll get Birinci.
For God's sake! I said cheap,
and he's talking about Birinci.
This is a strange country.
Even the cheap ones have fancy names.
You just know everything, don't you?
For God's sake.
I'll just get this over with.
We won't make it otherwise.
"Down…"
"Down with…"
- What was the rest of the slogan?
- I don't know.
It could be "fascism" or "imperialism."
You best leave it blank, Nuran.
Veli can finish it up.
"Down with …ism."
Brilliant idea.
- Silverberries?
- No, thanks.
Veli?
Veli!
Veli!
Aunt İzzet got married a few years later.
Arranged marriage didn't work for me
but worked for her.
Don't be sad, all right?
Antep is not that far anyway.
I'll visit.
You all leave.
Everyone I love leaves me.
Gülseren, take care of yourself, okay?
Come here.
- I see you finally got married.
- I did.
It was 1980.
All we had left was a meager pension
and a few sacks of silverberries.
It was really getting on
my mother's nerves.
I had to get married,
and the sacks had to go.
Our marriage lasted
eight and a half months.
You should've seen
my mother's face when I was back.
I did, and it was hilarious.
Gülseren?
What's that?
Aren't you going to welcome me, Mom?
Answer me.
- It's a suitcase.
- And your husband?
He wouldn't fit in it.
It was the fireflies, wasn't it?
No, Mom.
So he must've realized you're insane
and kicked you out, right?
- Wrong.
- What is it, then?
He beat me.
So?
- What do you mean?
- What's the big deal?
That's no reason to leave.
He must've realized you're crazy
and kicked your ass.
No, Mom. No.
Sadri got mad because I knew things.
I'll sum up our entire marriage
in a single sentence.
"You think you know everything, Gülseren!"
For God's sake,
he was arranging our finances yesterday,
and he couldn't multiply
25 by 56 for, like, six hours!
He was sweating and all,
so just as he was about to kill himself,
I held him and said, "It's 1,400."
- So?
- So that was my mistake.
He thanked me first.
So I told him there's no need
as this is pretty simple stuff for me.
- Then we started fighting.
- So?
He said, "You take me for a fool.
You think you know everything?"
- "You'd starve if it weren't for me."
- So?
Then he said, "To hell with...,"
but I couldn't hear the rest
since he slapped me simultaneously.
But I think it was about you, Mom.
So?
What do you mean, "So?"
You still keep saying that.
What would it take?
- Is that why you left?
- I swear, Mom…
I swear
you're going to visit my grave and say,
"So? What's the big deal, Gülseren?"
"Is this why you're breaking up?
Is this why you left him?"
"What's the big deal?
What's a murder between husband and wife?"
Don't be ridiculous. As if you'd die.
So how did it end?
- Do you remember what Dad told you?
- What?
That your "so" s would kill him one day.
And he did die, you know.
But please spare me, will you?
For God's sake, look.
Stop beating around the bush.
Just answer me. Answer me!
- What?
- How did it end?
It ended with me leaving Sadri,
because I couldn't stand
the smell of meat anymore.
Smell of what?
Mom, he reeked of raw meat.
Gülseren, are you insane?
The man is a butcher!
Of course he reeks of meat.
For God's sake.
- He was such a charming...
- Mom!
Don't you call him charming.
Call him whatever you will.
A steak, sheep balls, anything.
- But please don't call him charming.
- Gülseren...
Don't, Mom.
Dear God…
God help me.
It's like I'm talking in another language.
God… God, please help me stay sane.
If it isn't the butcher's wife.
Ex-wife.
What? Seriously?
Yeah.
Tea?
Sure. What happened?
Ugh, Uncle…
I explained it to Mom.
I don't want to go over it again.
Mom will be talking about it
for a hundred years, so you'll find out.
Yeah.
So, aren't you getting arrested nowadays?
They're not wise to it yet.
See, I use an alias for my articles.
But we're so close, Gülseren.
The revolution is underway.
God willing, we'll be victorious.
"God willing"?
- I meant, "hopefully."
- And is God your source of hope?
- You know…
- Yeah?
I thought you burned all my books
when I was arrested.
- But then I found...
- They're all safe.
- But İclal put them in a sack and...
- Gave it to me.
Then I removed the covers and put them
in Uncle Kürşat's books' covers.
I'm so glad you did that.
I have a question, Gülseren.
Yeah?
What did you do with my books' pages?
Did you put them
in another commie's books' covers?
Nice to see you too, Uncle.
Had I not read the books in their entirety
and found out the contents were a bit odd…
I'm surprised he did.
…the poison of communism
might have seeped into my brain.
Thank God while I was reading
the work of Sayyid Qutb,
I was disturbed by the constant remarks
about "Kral Marx,"
so I realized something was wrong.
Stop laughing.
- Mrs. Gülseren.
- Yeah?
Perhaps the work of Sayyid bin Zerdich
is also suffering in between the covers
of a cursed volume of "Das Kapitol."
Sayyid bin Zerdich?
What's the problem, Kürşat?
You read a few proper books by accident.
So, Sayyid Qutb's work is not proper,
but Kral Marx's Das Kapitol
is proper, is that so?
Karl Marx, not "Kral."
Das Kapital, not "Kapitol."
- Such ignorance!
- Shut up.
I think Uncle Kürşat has
already formed a concrete opinion,
so he reads books
which fit that narrative.
He's not reading to learn new things
but to reinforce what he already knows.
See, Kürşat? She put it very well.
Although, Uncle Hazım,
you're more or less the same.
See, Hazım? She put it very well.
So you're saying
this zealot and I are the same?
I'm the one who's upset that she thinks
such an infidel and I are the same!
Get the hell out of here!
I'm leaving by God's will.
You bigot.
Shame on you.
I was just talking about
the correct order of things.
You're supposed to learn
and then understand...
Luckily, I won't stoop so low
and listen to what
the butcher's ex-wife has to say.
I started writing in 1938.
Short stories about…
Gülseren.
Did it hurt a lot?
What?
When he beat you. You're okay, right?
Oh, Mom. I'm fine.
Don't worry about it.
I'm just curious,
but you have to tell me the truth.
It's because of the fireflies, right?
God… Mom, please.
On that same night,
that strange night in September,
I wasn't able to sleep.
It's like the night was
slithering inside me like a snake.
That was not a good sign.
- Uncle Hazım? What...
- Hush. Help me out.
What's going on?
The junta is here.
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know.
I think I have no choice but to run.
Come on.
Don't worry.
This ruckus won't last long.
I'll be back in a few days.
Hazım? Gülseren? What's going on?
What could it be?
A coup happened
thanks to your brother-in-law.
- What?
- The junta is here.
- Who's that? Why is he coming so late?
- I don't have time.
I'm leaving. Goodbye.
- Where are you going?
- I can't tell you, İclal.
For God's sake.
Take care of your mother.
You know I love you.
You're a good kid.
Where are you going?
I thought the revolution was underway!
Are you just going to run away
at a glimpse of our brave soldiers?
Let's see if you can hide.
- Go to Moscow.
- Go to hell!
Go on. Off to Moscow!
You've poisoned the soil.
Sacred nation of Turkey,
the Turkish Armed Forces have decided
to fulfill their duty, as described
by the Internal Service Law,
of protecting the Republic of Turkey
on behalf of the nation
and seized power entirely.
Mom?
What a wonderful voice.
Separatist lobbies…
This is the sound of peace.
God willing,
we can finally peacefully sleep at night.
Who's that? I hope it's nothing bad.
- What is this?
- Thank God you're here, sir.
- Kürşat Tümer.
- Do you need me as a witness?
Are you Kürşat Tümer?
- I am, but...
- Take him.
Sir, this is a mistake.
- Hurry up. Don't resist.
- Sir, what are you doing?
İclal! Stop. İclal!
- Kürşat!
- I'm Muslim! I'm loyal to the state!
Kürşat!
- İclal!
- Kürşat!
- Please, for the love of God!
- What did he do? Where are you taking him?
This is a mistake, sir.
Congressmen and senators who
are supposed to act on people's behalf
have been watching all these events unfold
without ever feeling responsible
just to protect their interests and power.
IMMIGRANTS GET THEIR SHARE
OF THE MARSHALL PLAN AID
LEFTISTS ARE STILL INVESTIGATED
This is the postcard my uncle sent
two years later from Stockholm.
The snowy North.
A tragic story of his escape.
An exile
misses even the prisons in his country.
Uncle Kürşat was a different man
by the time he was out.
He became silent.
He stayed in his room
for months, reading and praying.
Where are you even going, Kürşat?
To find God.
By myself, without asking anyone.
How are you going to do that?
Gülseren.
May God protect you.
You will find God.
It's beautiful just to look for Him.
By the '80s, my mother and I were
all alone in the mansion we inherited.
That's me at work with my colleagues.
So you finally started working.
I wanted to make some money
and to get away from Mom's nagging.
I may have also gotten fooled by
the "get rich quick" schemes of the '80s.
I just wanted to connect with life
that had been revolving around me.
I even put on makeup that day.
Who is it?
I can tell you if you want,
but you wouldn't recognize me.
You might as well say, "Come in."
Come in.
Hello.
- Gülseren Biröz.
- Somer Yoğurtçuoğlu.
Pleasure to meet you.
It's definitely "Somer,"
though, not "Soner."
You're already making me nervous.
Because everyone will, at some point,
mistakenly call you "Soner."
- Would you like to take a seat?
- I would.
I like to take seats
as much as anyone does.
You know, I even lie down sometimes.
- You haven't taken a seat though.
- Right.
I'll just…
I doubt there's any other nation
who enjoys sitting as much as we do.
Right?
We keep sitting down.
We even visit each other just to sit down.
Foreigners ask each other
where they "live."
We ask each other where we "sit."
We love sitting down. I wonder why.
I believe that's why our buttocks
are our most developed organs.
I believe that.
But what if we just stood up and…
Buttocks?
Yes.
Not mine personally. I'm sorry.
I was talking about buttocks generally.
I mean, since we're constantly sitting,
the buttocks are getting very...
Miss, I only asked you to take a seat,
not to talk about your buttocks,
for God's sake.
I think I'm talking too much
because of the nerves.
I'm here regarding your ad in the paper.
I see you're looking for an assistant.
If it's not taken yet, I'd like to apply.
Do you know about typewriters?
Yes, they're used to type.
I mean, can you actually use one properly?
I see. No.
But if you give me a chance, I'll be able
to even type with my toes in no time.
I'm joking. I won't be able to.
Look, miss. I don't like jokes.
I don't recall consciously cracking
even a single joke since middle school.
I don't crack jokes. I don't like jokes.
I don't laugh at people's jokes.
I don't care how Nasreddin Hodja
was pouring yogurt into the lake.
It's not like I was trying to be humorous.
I was just being silly.
Like I said, this is my first interview.
I'm just nervous. Sorry.
What do you do?
I'm a housewife.
What was your last house of employment?
- Excuse me?
- See, that was a joke.
A joke.
It's not like I can't do it.
I just don't like them.
See, you told me you were a housewife,
and I just cracked one.
"Last house of employment."
See, that's clearly a joke.
So, I can crack jokes.
I just don't want to.
I understand.
With some difficulty, but I do.
I mean, not everyone has to like jokes.
We were told jokes for years.
Temel, Fadime…
Enough. It's not funny.
No one's laughing. Fadime isn't funny.
Who are they?
Fadime, sir.
She's Temel's wife.
Funny things happen to them.
They're called "jokes."
Miss, we're actually
looking for an experienced clerk.
I know. The ad had
the word "experienced" capitalized.
It was so big that it looked like
you're just after someone
with any experience
who also happens to be a clerk.
Miss, you still seem to be cracking jokes.
- But I'm not.
- Don't.
I'm really not.
I'm sorry if that's what it looked like.
I'm even thinking about my dead relatives
just so I can be more serious.
Dead? Who's dead?
Dead, devoid of life.
You know, dead.
Miss, are you insane?
I do have some
psychological treatment experience.
I recommend it.
I've cured four psychiatrists.
So you're expecting me to hire someone
who talks about
improving her buttocks by sitting down,
who's getting psychological treatment,
who has no experience,
who doesn't even know how to type?
Yes.
You can start tomorrow.
Thank you so much.
Unbelievable.
Someone made me laugh
for the first time in 15 years.
That was a laugh just now.
- Was it?
- Yes.
See, I laughed again.
My facial muscles are not functioning
since I haven't laughed for years.
That's why I…
You're right.
Your cheeks aren't moving at all.
Just lower your jaw.
Exactly. Just a bit to the sides.
- A bit more.
- Which side?
You know, both. Or like this…
Maybe add the sound later.
It'll come to you. Just…
Just a bit to the sides.
I can't do it.
I don't like things I can't do.
I started working. I was busy.
I was getting along with everyone too.
But thanks to my twisted fate,
everything went downhill again.
- What happened?
- The firm was falsifying export reports.
The police raided the office.
The real owner ran away.
Nothing worked out for me.
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.
Did you ever fall in love?
That's none of your business,
but I'll still answer.
I met him just as I was losing all hope.
Miss. Miss?
- Yeah?
- You dropped an orange.
Thanks. I'll take it.
There you go.
With the hole in the bag
and the force of gravity…
Yes, that must be why.
It was meant to be yours. Keep it.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
May I help you with the bags?
My mother would love
for me to say, "No, thank you."
- But?
- But my arms are killing me.
I'd be glad if someone saved me.
- There we go.
- Is it too heavy?
Not at all.
Let's keep them safe this time around.
I have a silly habit of trying to guess
the names of people I meet.
I'm very bad at it.
For instance,
you seem like a Tuna or an İlhan to me.
My name is Dündar.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Tijen.
- Likewise, Ms. Tijen.
I'm kidding. I'm Gülseren.
I don't look like a Tijen.
Do I look like one? Definitely not.
- Careful.
- I'm okay.
I'll take that.
Sorry if that looked deliberate.
- It's not too heavy, is it?
- Not at all. It's fine.
So what's 28 times 41?
It's 1,148.
How am I supposed to know
if that's correct?
Pull out your pen and paper and calculate.
Right.
What a silly orange, right?
It found a hole in the bag, fell out,
and found Mr. Dündar.
But sadly,
at the best part of the conversation,
it's my neighborhood.
This is the border?
More like here,
but not a single step more.
- A single step?
- Here.
- All right.
- Okay, that's it.
Any further would
put us in the local paper.
"Gülseren was seen
with a handsome gentleman!"
Was that weird, calling you handsome
right in front of you?
You know, I'm not that good-looking.
I mean, I do have an appeal.
Do I? I'm not sure.
You do.
I'd hate to suffer
the consequences of unrequited love.
That was too soon, wasn't it?
Do you believe in love at first sight?
I do.
Oh, you do?
- So, the bags…
- Right, the bags.
- I forgot about them.
- Yeah.
- And I'll take...
- Be careful. It has a hole.
- It might fall again.
- Okay.
There you go. All right. This one's mine.
Keep it, sir.
- Should I call you "sir"?
- No.
Keep it, then.
I will.
Don't cross the border.
Okay. This is where I stop.
All right.
What's 95 times 42, then?
It's 3,990.
Okay…
Then 85 times 68?
It's 5,780.
One second.
I got you this time. Look.
You didn't.
You keep messing up the summation.
You should've carried the two over.
So the things I do in my mind,
you can't do with pen and paper.
I give up.
I'm sorry,
but what am I supposed to do? It's…
I've never met a lady
of superior intelligence.
An intelligence of no use.
I'm like a breathing multiplication table.
So you've not only met a woman
of superior intelligence,
you're actually holding her hand.
I'm aware.
Have you ever seen fireflies?
Of course I have.
There were a quite few
in our backyard at our old place.
If what you're saying is true,
it wasn't the orange
who brought us together, but God himself.
We used to collect them in jars sometimes.
That… I wish you hadn't done that. Yeah.
I think we've fallen in love, right?
- If thinking of you every moment is love…
- Don't ask questions.
- I'm busy thinking of you.
- Oh, come on! I was…
I thought you were mad or something.
Yes, we've fallen in love.
Just three weeks before you join the army.
Yeah.
How long is it?
Eighteen months.
I mean,
if I think of you ten times a day,
that's 5,400 in 540 days.
That's a lot.
It is.
Are you doing this on purpose?
You could've finished it earlier.
I don't know. I was studying.
Isn't it perfect that in our lives,
nothing is perfect?
I hope no one kisses your hand.
Like that, I mean.
Likewise.
Like that, I mean.
Shall we eat?
All right. I'm letting go, then.
- Okay.
- Let's eat.
What's 73 times 64?
It's 4,672.
You know,
there are a lot of fireflies tonight.
We might as well call them "starflies."
Indeed.
It's a bit damp. Don't catch a cold.
I'll be fine.
No, just come closer.
How can I come any closer?
Like… Under my arm.
You won't be cold
if you put your head here.
But if I do what you're saying…
What's the problem?
…I'd be lying in your arms.
- In my arms.
- Yeah.
That's naughty. I mean…
"Lying in someone's arms."
"To be caught lying in someone's arms."
All right.
So don't lie in my arms, but…
And?
…put your head on my chest.
"Putting your head on someone's chest."
That's a nice way of putting it.
That'll do.
I mean, my mom would
still kill me if she saw us, but…
- Come on, then.
- Okay.
- Like this.
- Like this?
- Yeah.
- Okay. Also if I sit like this…
And then I put my arm around here
so that we'd be hugging.
So, let's give the signal.
Your lips are very warm.
- What?
- Nothing.
Then what happened?
He died after his fifth letter.
- He was shot in a firefight.
- Oh.
Don't be surprised.
People I love die early.
It's like a tradition.
Dündar…
He was such a short
but also such a beautiful story.
It was like when you find a song
you really like on the radio,
but just as you're turning it up, it ends.
It was just like that.
Or perhaps it caused
a simply half-written story
to last a lifetime.
This page of our album is reserved

This was our first TV.
This was the first one with color.
And this was the last one with color.
Gülseren!
- Get out of the way! I can't see!
- Don't!
For God's sake!
Stop!
Mom, stop hitting me.
Get out of the way!
- Get out of the way.
- The vacuum isn't working.
For God's sake.
- It just won't.
- Gülseren, this is a bad time.
Move!
Pick that up, Mom.
For God's sake.
Did you vacuum here?
I did.
Five, four, three, two, one!
HAPPY NEW YEAR
And welcome to the circus
of Turkey in the 2000s.
THIS IS A SECOND-CLASS HOTEL
By the 2000s,
the Toothpickman Mansion
was rented out room by room.
It was
Nutty Gülseren's Guesthouse by then.
GÜLSEREN GUESTHOUSE
Hello, Televole!
They're not here.
It's sunny, rainy,
and cloudy at the same time.
It's like signs of doomsday.
Let's get crazy.
This interview is just too serious.
Gülseren, move. We're trying to watch.
And you, lovely people
who are staring into this box
like you've been put under a spell,
who are filling the void
in your heads with all this junk.
Greetings!
I'd like to welcome all our viewers,
starting with my own mother,
with love from the bottom of my heart.
We are here before you yet again
with another round of degeneracy
labeled as entertainment.
God, give me patience.
Get out of my house!
My son is coming home from Germany.
Shut up, for God's sake.
She's right, you know.
We stare at it like morons every night.
Humans are driven towards the light.
Right, Mom?
Sometimes it's an insect,
sometimes it's a TV.
Gülseren, shut up.
For the love of God, shut up.
I'll have a heart attack,
and God will punish you for it.
Dad and I talked about
this punishment issue.
I'm already being punished,
and the punishment is you.
Are you still talking?
Mom, you're looking
at a box that talks all day.
So you don't mind talking per se.
You just mind me talking.
Gülseren, shut up. For God's sake, please.
So, my dear audience,
abiding by my mother's request
and being the good child I am,
I'm now shutting down
the biggest source of noise.
Good night.
- What the hell?
- What are you doing, Gülseren?
You're getting worse every day.
Gülseren!
- Where are you taking the TV?
- Some peace and quiet will be good for us.
God help us! Gülseren!
- God damn it!
- Give it back!
Where are you taking it? Someone stop her.
I swear…
God damn you, Gülseren!
PARKING LOT
What the hell, ma'am?
Why are you in front of our mansion?
Who says it's your mansion?
- The government.
- Mind your own business.
How can I do that
when you're occupying my property?
- I have a short fuse, you know.
- Is that so? Mine is even shorter.
- Come on. Leave.
- Don't touch me.
- Just go!
- No.
What are you talking about?
This is a parking lot.
- What parking lot? This is our mansion!
- Someone get her!
She's crazy.
She's insane.
I don't want you people here.
We had only one form of entertainment,
and she just threw it away.
My son is coming home from Germany. Leave!
Shut up, you. Enough already.
I'm glad you're here.
I explained the situation
to your lovely mother.
My son is coming home from Frühstück.
- Just leave.
- We will, Mr. Nevzat. Don't worry.
Why would we leave?
This is our house. He should leave!
Just humor him for a bit, Mom.
Mr. Nevzat, why don't you go to your room?
All right. I'll go.
But you people have to leave.
- Okay, sir.
- Let's go.
What happened to your clothes?
It's fine. I had a fight.
- You had a fight?
- Yeah.
Don't tell me
you've become an anarchist like Veli.
I gave him money
so that he could buy me bread.
That rascal didn't bring
the bread or the change.
Do you think he started smoking?
What does Veli have to do with this?
I had a fight
with those parking lot thugs.
Why did you fight them?
We don't even have a car.
They're right in front of our house.
I've said all my farewells here.
To my aunt, my uncle, Uncle Hazım,
my father…
I swear this city is too crowded, Mom.
- So?
- Hey!
- Don't start with your "so" s.
- You…
God sent you to me as punishment.
I knew that when you left that charming...
Don't say it, Mom.
You can't call a man
who reeks of meat "charming."
- I can.
- You can't!
I can, and I will!
He was charming, charming, charming!
You're driving me insane.
Me? Oh, no. You were born insane.
- I'm not insane.
- You are.
- I'm not!
- You are.
You're completely insane.
- Just like he was charming...
- Shut up, Mom!
Why would I?
You've been talking
to fireflies for 50 years.
You've been feeding them for 50 years!
What do you call that if not insanity?
You…
If you were a reasonable person,
we wouldn't have ended up like this.
Look at us, Gülseren!
Just look at us!
I get that you left the butcher,
but why did you chase away
the kid from Beypazarı who...
For God's sake, don't get started.
- He was charming too.
- Stop saying that!
But he was! He was so charming.
It's because of the fireflies.
To hell with those fireflies,
and to hell with you!
Is there a single other person
who talks to fireflies?
- Is there?
- There was!
Aunt İzzet saw them.
Dündar too!
Dad believed me!
But since you were born blind,
you couldn't see them.
You spent your life
complaining and muttering.
You imprisoned us all
in your own lovelessness.
You never kissed us. You never loved us.
You never told me you loved me.
Not even once.
You never cried.
You don't have tears, Mom.
You don't have a heart.
That's why you just won't die.
Everyone died, Mom. Yet you remain.
You're standing guard
over all our pain and suffering.
I love you, Mom!
Why don't you die already?
I love you! Just die already, Mom!
Mom.
Are you asleep?
Mom, are you asleep?
Can I sit here?
I love you, Mom. Just sleep.
Oh, the only mom in the world
who doesn't like kisses.
This is the only way I could kiss you.
I always kissed you in secret.
I love you, Mom.
Just sleep.
I'll go check the fireflies and come back.
Have you ever seen fireflies?
- Fireflies?
- Fireflies?
- Have you ever seen fireflies?
- What?
Welcome, everyone.
Welcome to our channel, We're The Talent!
I have yet more incredible news
for you this week.
Mrs. Gülseren baffled us all
by being able to multiply
four-digit numbers in her head
without using any tools whatsoever.
We thought we'd be surprised for a bit
and then leave, but we stayed.
15,936,964.
- 4,156 times 3,529?
- 28,655,055.
You're famous now, Mrs. Gülseren.
You're trending, in the top ten.
They call you
"Mrs. Einstein" in the comments.
Maybe we could shoot another one?
"Gülseren versus Einstein."
What's that supposed to mean?
Einstein does that.
Oh, right.
Bad idea.
Everyone is watching you.
They're baffled by you.
Who knows, maybe some of us
will even manage to understand you.
No.
Being baffled is always easier
than understanding.
It's time to say goodbye.
I'm going to find myself a good spot
and hold a funeral for one.
I'm going to bury everyone I love.
Only God knows how we'll end…
but the beginnings belong to us.
Lamps just emit light…
but fireflies illuminate.
All right.
