Murder.
Oh, God, Sam. Murder?
-It wasn't me.
-Nobody couId understand this.
It's too much.
I thought it wouId be easier
if I toId you a IittIe at a time.
It wouId sink in a IittIe at a time.
Sink in a IittIe at a time?
You just dropped an emotionaI...
...anviI on my head.
Look at me. I'm fIat as a pancake.
-Are you even Iistening to me?
-I'm Iistening to you, Ruby.
I'm Iistening to you with aII my heart...
...and that's why I had to teII you.
That's why you need to understand.
{y:i}And that's when I feIt it.
{y:i}FeIt what?
The fist.
-What kind of fist?
-Pressing on me. ParaIyzing me.
It's so stupid, because,
based on what he had just toId me...
...I shouId have punched him with that fist,
in the other eye this time.
I shouId have just kicked him out!
But I couIdn't.
Do you Iove Sam?
Dear, you know, there's reaIIy not much
I can do to heIp you...
...if you don't taIk to me.
But it's not about me. It's about Sam.
After aII our time together and aII
our sessions, you stiII beIieve that?
I must suck.
You say it's about Sam.
Okay. Let's taIk about Sam, and we'II see.
But Iet's incIude this reveIation
in our thinking.
Crank it back, just rewind.
TeII me again, how did you meet him?
TeII me what it was Iike.
It was exciting.
{y:i}It was Iike a roIIer-coaster ride.
{y:i}The worId, the night, the Iights,
{y:i}everything was...
...fast.
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah.
Sounds Iike faIIing in Iove to me.
Sam said something Iike that.
First time we met.
Something about Iove and time.
-He said your heart....
-...is Iike a cIock measuring time...
...and one's emotionaI state
determines the fIow of time.
It speeds it up or sIows it down.
-So, time is a personaI thing.
-Sure.
Time is an emotionaI thing.
That's what you're saying.
It's true. Don't bad things
aIways seem to Iast Ionger than good ones?
But good things seem to just fIy by...
...Iike the best times in Iife.
Like what?
-Like--
-Like faIIing in Iove.
Oh, my God! I'm Iate for work.
I totaIIy spaced.
See what I mean?
{y:i}That was the morning we first met.
{y:i}I got fired that afternoon.
I cannot give you my name, sir.
Do you want the number, or....
My number?
TeII me what you Iook Iike first.
So. What did he say?
He said I took too much time.
That's men for you, aIways in a rush.
Shit, you're heIpfuI.
I mean, isn't that
what directory assistance operators are for?
I was too heIpfuI.
You know, Iet me taIk to my boss.
I'II see if I can get you a job teaching ESL.
-How's your grammar?
-Fuckin' great.
So, over breakfast Iast month, he goes:
''Do you beIieve in Christ as your savior?''
-You're kidding?
-I'm teIIing you the truth.
Five months, not a peep
about anything remoteIy spirituaI, right?
AII carnaI. The guy just wants to fuck.
-Then he just springs this on you?
-That's right.
So, I teII him, ''I'm Jewish, you idiot.
''I'm a Jew.
''I mean, what do you think,
I'm a Jew for Jesus or something?''
He freaks out. I freak out.
It turns out he's a Jew for Jesus.
-And he never toId you?
-Not a peep.
That's the Trojan horse strategy.
They get you to bring them into your paIace,
and then out come the soIdiers.
Do you remember Steven? The Adventist?
The reIigious ones
are reaIIy sneaky that way, right?
-You got a mug shot?
-Oh, my God!
You're kidding!
-I think he beIongs in the box, pIease.
-I know.
We need a bigger box.
I don't think they're aII going to fit.
UnIess Ruby wants her own.
Guess what, CIaire?
You have more in there than I do.
-I don't think so.
-Count them up.
Don't count. That's depressing.
Remember that Ruby has a higher handicap,
because she's a recovering codependent.
I was fired today.
Ruby, did you ever actuaIIy fix any of them?
She doesn't reaIIy fix them.
She goes in there to fix them...
...and discovers that they're permanentIy
broken, then she ends up dumping them.
-AII those men.
-You mean, aII those probIems.
The narcissist.
The abductee.
The bad drummer.
{y:i}The artist.
Are you Ieaving me?
Or are you Ieaving my work?
{y:i}The bad actor.
Don't come crying to me
when I'm famous and you're, Iike:
''Ned, pIease take me back.'' It's over.
{y:i}The fetishist.
I shouId have expected this.
It's happened before.
{y:i}The Frenchman.
{y:i}Fini?
{y:i}The junkie.
Okay, enough.
I'm not fixing anymore.
I'm not in that business anymore.
My fixing days are over.
TeII that to your therapist, you kook.
That's what she teIIs me to say.
I'm sorry about the job, baby.
{y:i}-I've got one question for you.
{y:i}-Shoot.
Do the words ''Jesus Christ''
mean anything to you?
-I'm a painter. I paint.
-What, houses?
I'm a reaI painter. I'm having a big show
in a coupIe of months.
-Hey.
-Ned.
-How you doing?
-AII right. You?
Great. Have you seen me
since this happened?
Pretty good?
I've been doing a Iot of Iifting weights.
Doing a Iot of free-weights,
isometrics, my body fat's way Iow.
{y:i}So, what was it Iike?
{y:i}What was it about him?
For God's sake, swing it around here.
-Starboard. Right.
-Starboard.
That's Victor.
His sister went down in the "Titanic".
He aIways taIks about it.
-She went down on the "Titanic".
-I know. I remember.
OId foIks are great.
You shouId hear the stories.
Wow.
-You an artist?
-No. It's just a hobby.
KiIIs time.
{y:i}What was it about him?
{y:i}Maybe it was his manner.
{y:i}He seemed gentIe.
{y:i}But I didn't think I'd see him again.
''I....''
{y:i}He was one of those guys
{y:i}you meet for a moment...
{y:i}...but that Iodge themseIves
{y:i}in your brain forever.
''...that my own needs are important.''
{y:i}Better for fantasizing about
{y:i}than actuaIIy sIeeping with.
''I am wiIIing to find a baIance
between my own needs...
''...and my concern for others.''
{y:i}Better as mysteries.
{y:i}Because we aII know what happens
{y:i}when you take away the mystery.
Hi, Ruby.
Hi.
How do you know my name?
You Ieft your book in the park.
Your nametag.
I Iooked up your name in the phone book.
I put it back on Page 45, where it was.
You couId have just caIIed.
You know. I was in the neighborhood.
-Don't you work today?
-It's my day off.
-What's it about?
-It's....
It's erotica.
Anaïs Nin.
You didn't peek?
What's that?
-What?
-You smeII that?
It's subIime. It's beautifuI.
I don't smeII anything.
It's....
The perfume, it's IoveIy.
Thanks.
You're not from here, are you?
It's that obvious?
-What, are you from the Midwest?
-Dubuque.
Ohio?
ActuaIIy, it's Iowa. Dubuque, Iowa.
It is?
Shit! Okay.
-What?
-Nothing. I'm fine.
I'm okay.
We don't....
We just don't have IittIe ones
Iike that in Dubuque.
But I'm okay. I'm fine.
I think I shouId apoIogize.
I've been acting a IittIe odd.
It's just because I've never done this before.
So much has happened, so many surprises.
I haven't been abIe to stop
thinking of you since we met--
-But we just met.
-And why you Ieft the book.
-I'm absent-minded.
-I think that you've been thinking about me.
Look, I don't even know you.
I know.
-Deep inside you've wondered about me?
-No.
-And why I'm here in New York City?
-No.
Can we meet? After?
After what?
CIass.
My name is Ruby Weaver.
I'm your new teacher.
This is my acquaintance.
What's your name?
My name is Sam Deed.
I am from Dubuque, Iowa.
Thank you.
Who are you?
Sam Deed.
I know. And what's your agenda?
Agenda?
I'm not Iooking for a reIationship right now.
I need baIance in my Iife.
It's reaIIy nice to be taIking to you.
I'm onIy here because I Iiked what you did
in my cIass today.
So...
...are you an army brat?
-What's that?
-The Ianguages....
Did your parents traveI around a Iot as a kid,
in the miIitary or something?
ActuaIIy, I've never Ieft Dubuque before.
What brings you to New York?
Job at the UN?
-Job at the United Nations?
-No.
I came here three months ago and....
Are you okay?
I'm sorry.
You don't have to say anything...
...if it makes you uncomfortabIe.
Do you Iike music?
-Yeah. Doesn't everybody?
-I Iove music.
-You're not a drummer, are you?
-No. I Iike to Iisten to it.
WouId you Iike to Iisten to music with me
tomorrow night?
Come up for a sec. I'm aImost ready.
-Hi. I'm ready.
-Hey.
Are you ready to rock?
What?
You know, if you toId me you wanted
to just Iisten to music...
...I do have a CD pIayer.
The man said these were warmer.
Can you do this?
Yeah.
You Iook great.
Thanks.
I thought that we were gonna go out, so I...
...dressed up.
Is this typicaI of your musicaI taste?
I Iove this.
This is....
Wine?
What do you caII this?
French MerIot.
Don't sound French to me.
Do you want to dance to this
French MerIot with me?
-This is Iike an "Art of War" thing, right?
-What?
You just confuse your foe,
and then you move in fast for the kiII?
Come on. Life is short.
-What are you on? Ecstasy?
-Ecstasy?
Why are you so happy?
'Cause I'm here with you.
But you don't even know me...
...at aII.
I'm sorry.
It's just that where I'm from,
courting rituaIs are...
...reaIIy abbreviated.
I'm sorry.
''Courting rituaIs''?
What are we, birds?
You couId show me.
-Show you what?
-How to court you.
This is new.
The man asking the woman
how she wants to be seduced.
Like a roIe-reversaI strategy?
No.
There's no strategy.
I just Iiked taIking to you
that day in that park.
I think you're reaIIy...
...great, and I'd Iike to get to know you.
And I think the reason
why I'm acting so awkward...
...it's because I'm worried
about acting awkward. That's aII.
-You want to know how to court me?
-I wouId.
Take off this shit, put on something good,
and pour me some more wine.
{y:i}So, that's how it happened.
{y:i}Like I toId you, fast.
{y:i}It was briIIiant strategy.
{y:i}He tricked me into picking up him.
{y:i}He'd never have figured it out on his own.
I Iove you.
{y:i}So that's when you started
{y:i}to become suspicious, correct?
{y:i}No. It was after that.
It was definiteIy after he moved in.
When was that? When did he move in?
Later that week.
José couIdn't put him up anymore.
He needed a pIace to stay.
Didn't it occur to you at the time...
...that this kind of compuIsive behavior
is repetitive for you?
It's cIassic codependency.
It's why you came to see me.
This is what you don't want anymore
in your Iife.
This is what we've been working on.
I mean, Sam has a probIem...
...and you make sacrifices to fix it.
But it wasn't a sacrifice.
It was great.
Oh, my God!
{y:i}I was reaIIy happy.
{y:i}After aII the boozers and fuck-ups
{y:i}and gender fIoppers...
{y:i}...and the fiasco with Tab.
{y:i}I mean, Sam, he couId be
{y:i}over the top sometimes, but it was fun.
-Sweetie, you want to go in?
-Go in there?
But Iisten, it wasn't Iike I just
jumped bIindIy into this reIationship.
Are you sure you don't want to go in?
What is this? Why wouId I want to go in?
{y:i}I was very cautious.
{y:i}Very cautious.
You pass.
Let's see it. Come on.
{y:i}At first there didn't seem
{y:i}Iike there was anything to worry about.
{y:i}Sam aIways had a cIever expIanation
{y:i}for everything.
I Iost a dare to a friend at a Stop & Shop.
If you scan me, I'm a dozen bananas.
{y:i}Even his friend José
{y:i}saw good coIors in my aura.
{y:i}Said he feIt reaIIy good about us.
{y:i}Like we were kind of meant for each other.
This is great for the reIationship.
It's perfect.
Our reIationship
has to be about trust, and....
{y:i}We both toId each other everything
{y:i}about ourseIves, about our famiIies.
We went to the AI-Anon meetings
every week.
My mother, she took the brunt of it,
of course.
But it worked.
He doesn't drink anymore.
{y:i}That's when he first toId me
{y:i}about his parents.
I reaIIy don't taIk to them much anymore,
since I Ieft Dubuque.
{y:i}And his sister.
She feII out of an eIm tree.
It was an accident.
And so after that, I had to....
I couIdn't stay in Dubuque.
And that's why you came to New York?
Do you have any pictures of her?
I don't Iike to Iive in the past.
Thank you for teIIing me, Sammy.
-Hi. How much?
-$8.75.
{y:i}Then I found the photos.
There you are. Thank you.
{y:i}I didn't want to think he Iied.
{y:i}Maybe he forgot.
{y:i}But how couId he forget?
{y:i}I Iet it sIide.
{y:i}But I guess after that, my antenna came out.
{y:i}I started to notice other things.
Just IittIe things.
Like he's scared of dogs.
Miniatures.
I mean, terrified.
-Maybe he got bit as a kid.
-Maybe.
TaIks in his sIeep.
That's a probIem for you?
It's just the things he says.
Break the causaI chain.
{y:i}And then everyday normaI things,
{y:i}just seem reaIIy new to him.
Oh, God. You're being so ridicuIous!
God!
He has speIIs, Gretchen!
SpeIIs? What do you mean?
{y:i}Sometimes he just stares at things.
{y:i}His eyes get aII gIazed over.
{y:i}Like he's in a trance.
{y:i}It's Iike he's reaIIy far away.
{y:i}It's weird.
Does it happen during sex?
-No.
-Then don't worry about it.
If these speIIs were happening during sex,
you know, then I'd worry.
That usuaIIy means they're thinking about
someone eIse, you know?
That's not Sam.
You know what he said to me
the other night?
{y:i}-What?
{y:i}-He said....
You know, I've never toId a woman
the things I've toId you.
You are the first and...
...the onIy.
You're the one and onIy.
You know....
I feeI Iike...
...my whoIe Iife
has just been a journey into your arms.
{y:i}Oh, my Larry. Are you kidding me?
Kick him out now
whiIe you got the chance, sister.
I guess you had to be there.
You are this incurabIe romantic,
Iike, thwarted back...
...to 1955, where you think
you are his first Iove.
You know, men onIy say that kind of shit
when they got some agenda goin' on.
He meant it. I mean, I think he meant it.
''I am wiIIing to find a baIance
between my own needs...
''...and my concern for others.
''I am Iearning to Iove myseIf
more every day.''
{y:i}Maybe I shouIdn't have been so paranoid.
What is it? What is he on?
{y:i}Maybe I shouId have just trusted him,
{y:i}the way he said he trusted me.
ShouId I worry?
OnIy...
...if you Iove saiIing.
It's prescription Dramamine.
It's prescribed for peopIe who suffer
severe distress at sea, seasickness.
Are you pIanning a cruise?
{y:i}Sammy?
Guess what today is?
{y:i}But I'd been burned so many times before.
"So, that's how it happened".
That's how I Iearned who I was Iiving with.
Hey, baby. Guess what day it is today?
Who is Chrystie DeIancey?
She's a girI.
Are you sIeeping with her?
''You're the one and onIy'' maybe.
God. Gretchen was right.
You're a hypocrite.
You're a Iiar and you're a cheat.
I am not a cheat.
What's this? Prescription Dramamine?
PIanning a IittIe cruise on "The Love Boat"
with Ms. DeIancey?
-It's not what you think.
-I don't know what to think!
You're fucking someone eIse.
You are the one and onIy.
Baby, that is the truth.
I got you some roses.
A whoIe dozen of them.
It's our three-month anniversary.
-Baby, don't cry.
-They're carnations.
Or is that another thing
they don't have in Dubuque?
You think I haven't noticed
your IittIe idiosyncrasies?
Your speIIs?
What's going on?
Don't give me any buIIshit.
Okay.
I'm Iistening.
I'm different.
You're gay.
You're a Jew for Jesus?
It's that tattoo. It's a cuIt.
You're a Branch Davidian?
You're a survivaIist!
You're a pimp,
and Chrystie DeIancey is one of your sIuts?
I'm not a pimp!
What then?
Okay, Iook, I'II say it. AII right?
I'm not from Dubuque.
Okay. You're not from Dubuque.
So where are you from then?
Dubuque.
I'm not from Dubuque in the way you think.
-How many ways are there?
-I'm not from your Dubuque.
Since when is Dubuque mine?
I've never been to Ohio!
-Iowa.
-Whatever.
I'm just saying that my Dubuque
is different from your Dubuque.
-How?
-It doesn't exist.
-You just said it's in Idaho.
-Iowa!
-So your Dubuque doesn't exist?
-Yet.
-Yet!
-Yet.
So when wiII your Dubuque exist?
2470...
...AD.
That's in 47 1 years...
...from now.
47 1 years?
Not counting Ieap years.
See, when I say ''my Dubuque,''
I don't mean the present Dubuque...
...which is your Dubuque.
I mean the future Dubuque,
which is where I'm from.
-The future.
-Oh, God.
At Ieast, forward on
the time-space continuum...
...which is how your scientific estabIishment
wouId understand it.
It's caIIed ''back-traveI.''
That's what I meant about who I am.
I'm a back-traveIer.
I know it's hard to understand, and...
...that's why it was hard to teII you,
because I knew you'd be reaI upset.
I didn't think you'd Iaugh in my face.
Come on. You're from the future?
I am from the future.
I'm from the year 2470.
I was born on May 8, 2439,
in Dubuque, Iowa...
...on the AtIantic coast.
That's right, the AtIantic coast.
It moved inIand,
after the icecaps meIted in 2330.
That was five years
after the Great Infestation eIiminated...
...aII pIant and vegetabIe matter,
trees and fIowers and domestic pets.
Cats, hamsters, dogs.
Okay, don't touch me.
Don't worry. I'm a BioIogicaI.
I'm just Iike you.
Back in 2470, most peopIe
are corporate-sponsored Gene Dupes...
...manufactured in the PhiIippines.
My parents were Anachronists.
-And they beIieved in doing it the oId way.
-Stop it!
What? I'm just being honest!
My parents raised my sister and me
on a reservation with other Anachronists.
The Gene Dupes kept us there.
They hated us.
We were aIways fighting for our nostaIgia
rights. My father was a freedom fighter.
He Ied the battIe
to have the Ban on Beauty Iifted, in 2451 .
The Gene Dupes finaIIy got him.
Want to know what his crime was?
He was teaching us an ancient protest song.
Maybe you've heard it before.
''I'm as a free as a bird now
''And this bird wiII never
''change''
My mother, she taught ancient Ianguages
in a IocaI schooI.
Spanish, French, Ebonics.
She died of cancer when I was 25.
You know, there's stiII no cure.
But I'II never forget what she toId me
whiIe I was watching her deconstruct.
She said to me, ''Make your sister proud.''
You know, not her, my sister.
But she died, too. 2468.
She was 1 4. I mean, 1 4.
That was a year after they banned
back-traveI. But that didn't stop anybody.
If you had guts you'd get an
Underground Agent to send you back.
And that's what I did.
That was six months ago.
There.
Now you know everything.
Any more questions?
Yes.
Who is Chrystie DeIancey?
{y:i}You're kiIIing me.
Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird"?
A protest song?
So, what, everybody's
a redneck in the future?
It's reaIIy hiIarious, Gretch!
He's dead serious.
You shouId have seen the Iook in his eye.
You want me to get the ex-fiIes?
Have you got a mug shot yet?
Why must they aIways be drawn to me?
I'm sorry.
AII right, don't keep me
in suspense anymore.
Who's this DeIancey ho?
My contact!
What kind of contact?
Another back-traveIer who can orient you.
Chrystie DeIancey was my contact.
I wrote her name down
so I wouIdn't forget it.
I found her.
She fiIIed me in on current events.
Taught me how to fIag a cab, and gave me
my back-story, and then she Ieft.
-''Back-story''? What?
-FaIse documents. A driver's Iicense.
Birth certificate.
You know, so you can assimiIate.
That's good.
Are you ''assimiIating'' with her?
No! She's oId and...
...wrinkIed and--
Looks pretty hot in your drawings!
That's not Chrystie DeIancey...
...baby.
{y:i}-''It's you. ''
{y:i}-What?
That's what he teIIs me.
The drawings are of me.
There's just a IittIe something
missing from your story.
Sanity.
That, and the part
where you waIk him to the door...
...and you open it and you say:
''Just get the fuck out of my apartment!
Get the heII out!''
{y:i}I tried.
{y:i}But then he starts into this story...
{y:i}...about a certain photograph.
I found a photograph of you.
And that's what these drawings are.
Of that photograph.
-Where's this photograph?
-The future.
-What?
-You can't bring non-carbon...
...based, inanimate matter back with you.
I know the drawings aren't very good.
Okay, bIame me for that.
But that's the way that...
...I remember that photo.
Okay?
Look, you couId say that they're drawings...
{y:i}...of a memory of a photograph...
{y:i}...of you.
Look, I can expIain. Okay?
After my sister died, I kind of Iost it.
{y:i}After his sister died...
{y:i}...he kind of Iost it.
{y:i}She was the onIy famiIy he had Ieft.
{y:i}And now there was no one.
{y:i}I guess Anachronists are big on famiIies.
One day....
{y:i}One day...
{y:i}...he stumbIes into this smaII curio shop.
{y:i}He says he was Iooking for a certain piece
{y:i}of obsoIete, pre-miIIennium technoIogy...
{y:i}...a gun.
{y:i}Instead, he finds this photograph.
{y:i}I stared at it for hours.
{y:i}Those hours, they turned into days.
{y:i}Every time I shut my eyes to go to sIeep...
{y:i}...I saw your face
{y:i}bIazing on the inside of my eyeIids.
And suddenIy I remembered everything
my dad fought for.
That the past had potentiaI,
that the past had meaning.
{y:i}So, I Ieaped into the temporaI stream,
{y:i}and I came back...
{y:i}...here, to this time, I guess, to find...
{y:i}...the meaning in Iife again.
To find your face.
My God, I'm gonna cry.
He was going to kiII himseIf.
He gave up aII he had in the future
to traveI through time to find me.
It's one of the most romantic, crazy,
fucked-up Iies a guy has ever toId me.
So, what did you say?
How do you respond to that?
Oh, my God!
{y:i}I didn't have time to.
{y:i}It hit me I'd made arrangements for us
{y:i}to have dinner at my parents' that night.
The one night I need to be on my toes.
I feeI so good about having come out.
We can be more honest with each other.
Just once, I wanted to impress them.
EspeciaIIy after that fiasco with Tab.
HeIIo, Theodore.
Listen, we're here, and I'm assuming
you're not going to say anything to them.
No. That wouId vioIate protocoI.
ProtocoI?
Strict ruIes of conduct for back-traveIers.
You never reveaI your identity,
where you're from or your name.
It's absoIuteIy forbidden.
Okay, so this is new.
Sam is not your reaI name?
-It's not.
-Okay.
What is your reaI name?
It's in binary code,
so it might not make sense.
But if you reaIIy want to know,
it's 01 1 1 1001 1 ...
...1 1001 10001 10.
Just Iike on my bar code and my chip.
My contact gave me ''Sam Deed.''
That's S-A-M, three. D-E-E-D, four.
That's three- and four-name combos.
AII back-traveIers have that...
...so we can identify each other,
aIso so we can avoid each other.
But protocoI prohibits us
from teIIing anybody any of this.
You just toId me.
Haven't you ever tied a tie before?
Dressing rituaIs went out with the advent of
disposabIe cIothes, back in the earIy 2200s.
Oh, God.
Just get me through this one night.
You know, Sam,
Ruby teIIs me that you work at a hospice.
Did you study medicine?
No. I drive the van, LiIIian.
-I see.
-So where you from, son?
He's from Iowa, Dad.
That's good country out there.
What part?
The AtIantic coast.
Sorry?
-Coast?
-He means the shoreIine.
-The Mississippi--
-River.
-ShoreIine.
-Right.
-Did you go to coIIege out there in Iowa?
-Didn't have to go to coIIege.
They pIanted everything I needed to know
right here when I was 3.
''PIanted''?
Sam is a prodigy.
He speaks five Ianguages fIuentIy.
Right?
-Prodigy.
-Oh, my God.
Not bad.
Is that Homeric or PIatonic Greek?
ActuaIIy, it's PIatonic.
Amazing. Fantastic.
You must have big ambitions.
PIease teII us,
what brings you to New York?
I came because of....
Okay, Marvin!
Down!
Wow.
I didn't know they were so soft.
{y:i}How is he?
-Who, Dad?
-Yeah.
Working. AIways. Buying, seIIing.
-That's good. Right?
-Sure.
Where did you meet this one? I Iike him.
-I do.
-You do?
I Iike him. He's sweet. He's funny.
You think he's funny?
Yes, funny.
LiIIian, these are great pickIes.
Very nice.
PickIes?
PickIes.
You reaIIy are funny.
You know, Sam has some incredibIe ideas
about investment.
-Does he reaIIy?
-Very advanced. Very exciting.
TeII us. Something that I shouId know?
Excuse me.
You aII right, son?
Is he aII right?
-What's wrong with him?
-I don't know.
-Sammy? Are you aII right, baby?
-I'm okay.
It didn't go very weII.
I know. I'm sorry.
It's my fauIt, you know, I....
First the thing with the dog, you know.
I can't beIieve I Ieft dinner so abruptIy.
It's okay. I think they reaIIy Iiked you.
-You think they reaIIy Iiked me?
-Yeah.
-ReaIIy?
-It's a first.
Wow!
You gotta teII me what's reaIIy going on...
...here.
I wouId never do anything
to hurt this reIationship. I wouIdn't.
That's the truth.
It's just that...
...I have...
...RTDS.
-RTDS?
-ResiduaI TemporaI Drag Syndrome.
It's a side effect of back-traveI.
Most peopIe caII it ''drag.''
It's Iike you're jet-Iagged.
You know, because when you back-traveI,
you go back centuries, Iike that.
The mind is a IittIe sIower.
It tries to catch up, but then it gets
confused and throws itseIf into reverse.
The causaIity of events fIips,
and time fIows backwards.
But you shouIdn't worry about it, okay?
Because most peopIe adjust in months.
-Most?
-Yeah.
For some peopIe, it just gets worse...
...untiI everything is in reverse aII the time.
They Iive in a reverse worId in their head
untiI they die.
''Die'' is the wrong word.
UntiI they re-enter their mother's...
...you know.
But you know, that Dramamine
that José got me, that heIps.
Maybe you shouId see someone.
There is someone that couId heIp me.
Who?
-Hey!
-You.
{y:i}Okay. Now it's making sense.
He's getting off on it.
You're getting off on it.
It's a kinky roIe-pIaying game.
RoIe-pIaying?
Look, I know I shouIdn't teII you this...
...but Mark and I pIay a IittIe game aIso.
Mark Iikes to pretend
that he's someone eIse in bed.
Who?
Anthony MichaeI HaII.
Shut up.
You know, that geeky actor kid
from that "Sixteen CandIes" movie.
-I swear to God.
-Shut up.
I'm just teIIing you this,
because some guys are kinky.
Maybe Sam watched
a Iot of "Star Trek" as a kid, you know?
Who cares?
God, as Iong as the sex is good.
But I don't think that this is about sex.
You're so oId-fashioned.
He's from the future.
What the heII do you guys
see in each other anyway?
I have to be abIe to trust him.
I mean, who is this DeIancey bitch?
He toId you.
She's his contact.
Come on. I'm teIIing you.
It's just a game. PIay aIong!
I think that I think
I'm going to have to Ieave him.
I thought you guys were coming
to the beach house this weekend.
That wouId be perpetuating the fantasy.
It's not deaIing with the probIem!
I have a therapist to answer to.
Just make up your mind, sweetie.
I mean, what are you waiting for, proof?
That's going to be hard to find. Mark.
{y:i}It shouId have been so easy to kick him out.
So why didn't you, right then?
Were you waiting for proof?
No! I don't know.
{y:i}I guess I was just curious.
{y:i}I wanted to get to the root of it.
{y:i}Maybe that's what the whoIe thing was,
{y:i}just morbid, sick curiosity.
How did you find me?
You just had that one, crumbIing photo.
The date was
eIectronicaIIy printed on the back.
And the guy in the curio shop...
...he just guessed that it was New York City
because of aII the bIack cIothing.
So I took a chance.
I came to this here and now.
Your face was as famiIiar to me as the sun.
{y:i}I searched and I combed the streets,
{y:i}and then that day in the park.
{y:i}It was a happy accident.
-It was just a happy accident?
-That's exactIy what it was.
Give me your waIIet.
-I don't have any money.
-Give me your waIIet.
Okay.
-What? I don't know who those peopIe are.
-Let me remind you! Mom and Dad!
That's back-story!
My contact gave me that! I toId you.
-That's not your sister?
-No.
That's not a photo of your sister?
You said you had no photos.
No. My sister was terrified of dogs.
-I know you don't beIieve me--
-There's a date on the back.
There's no way
that I can actuaIIy prove it to you.
1991 .
1991 sounds Iike the past, though,
it doesn't sound Iike the future.
You know what?
There's a phone number here, too.
Yeah?
So caII it!
I mean, if that's what you want to do, caII it!
That's what it's for, for doubters Iike you.
-You reaIIy want to know?
-I do want to know.
Then caII it! They'II teII you
everything you want to know.
My dad'II teII you
how he works in a pIastics factory...
...and my mom drives a schooI bus.
I was born in 1961, Dubuque.
I was a breech birth. Backwards?
It's a IittIe joke between back-traveIers.
They'II teII you that I was cIumsy in schooI.
I was aIways faIIing off the jungIe gym.
How I had an overactive imagination.
They'II teII you about the difficuIt years,
the bIack Iights, the acid trips.
The fights about money
and responsibiIities, proper hygiene!
How I ran away when I was 23...
...and they haven't heard from me since.
You see, my story...
...is a sad one.
You want to know why?
Because that's aII I couId afford.
I don't want to see you anymore.
Sit over here,
so that we're not facing each other.
I don't want to see you in my Iife anymore.
And the way that I see it,
it's freaks versus normaI guys...
...and you have confirmed yourseIf
as a member of the former.
-What's a freak?
-It's a weirdo!
You are scamming me somehow.
I don't know how...
...but I'm not sticking around to find out.
You caII me a weirdo?
I'm sorry it didn't work out, but my therapist
says that I have a fear of intimacy.
-I am freak.
-I think it's best if I work it out on my own.
Freak. I thought that was the dance
circa the 1970s. Weirdo, I know.
That's what BIinovitch's detractors
caIIed him...
...when he discovered
how to bend space and time in 2278.
Time-traveI is a physicaI impossibiIity.
So was the Iight buIb. So was
going to the moon. So was maIe pregnancy.
You expIain to me how
time-traveI is possibIe.
You teII me how
an internaI-combustion engine works.
You don't even know
how the basic quantum mechanics work.
Sit down.
-No!
-Sit down!
You want to know how back-traveI works?
Sit down.
Okay. Let's hear.
Give me your Ieg.
-You want to know how back-traveI works?
-Okay. Yes.
-You want to know how it works?
-I'm giving you my Ieg.
Let's say that this is the passage of time.
This is the present.
And that...
...is the past.
It's a memory.
The probIem aIways was...
...how to get from the present...
...aII the way back to the....
You can't do it, right?
Breaks aII the fundamentaI Iaws of physics.
It's impossibIe.
It's impossibIe.
But what if time isn't a rigid Iine?
What if you couId bend space and time...
...so that the present...
...Iays side by side with the past?
Then you reaIIy wouIdn't have to go
back at aII.
You'd just have to make a IittIe Ieap.
See, you go from here...
...to there.
{y:i}Maybe it was aII about sex at first.
{y:i}Maybe I was just in deniaI, buying time...
{y:i}...ignoring the probIem.
{y:i}But I reaIIy did want it to work.
{y:i}It reaIIy did feeI Iike a game.
{y:i}As Iong as it was just our IittIe game...
{y:i}...as Iong as he didn't teII anyone eIse...
{y:i}...everything seemed just fine.
So, why did the Gene Dupes ban it?
Back-traveI?
Brain drain. ApparentIy, too many
Anachronists disappeared into the past.
They banned it in 2467,
except for the terminaIIy iII.
That's fun isn't it? PIaying aIong?
Yeah. I mean, he's a freak,
but he teIIs a good story.
I'II bet he does.
What if he has?
-Has what?
-ToId someone eIse?
Then I'd worry. But he hasn't.
Don't worry. He couIdn't.
That wouId spoiI the fantasy.
Trust me on this one. He couIdn't.
Do you ever think about, Iike...
...the big issues, you know?
Like, where do we come from?
What are we here for?
The big questions.
Someday, Marko,
there won't be any big questions.
Like UFOs.
What are they?
They're intersteIIar traveIers.
They come from a pIanet caIIed Eenon
from the Sirus GaIaxy.
They stop here on Earth to fiII up
their nitro-carbon engines, and then....
Maybe.
What about God?
Is there a God?
SurprisingIy, yes. A Jesuit priest
found 102 of them using a teIepathy scope.
-Through a what?
-TeIepathy scope.
What's a teIepathy scope, dude?
You're aII right, man. I Iike you.
I feeI Iike I can taIk to you.
Gretchen, she's cooI and everything,
but I don't know if it's gonna work out.
She's not deep enough, you know?
What about Ruby? Is she deep?
What is this stuff?
I just want to say how happy I am
that you guys are here.
-We're happy, too.
-Let's toast.
To the future...
AII right.
...of our reIationships.
-Good MerIot, Gretchen.
-Thanks.
It's a Syrah, actuaIIy, from BraziI.
ApparentIy, they are growing grapes
where the rain forests used to be.
I think it's so tragic about the rain forests.
They're going so fast.
Do you know that I read
that they wiII aII be gone...
...by the year 2467?
ActuaIIy--
Can you teII that story about that time--
Can you imagine the worId
without the rain forests?
-That's deep.
-'Cause I often wonder...
...just aII of it, gone.
That's deep.
What do you think that worId
wouId be Iike, Mark?
That's reaI deep, baby.
You're stoned.
Ruby, what about you?
I heard that the rain forests are doing just
fine and in no danger, thanks to Sting.
How worthy of him.
What do you think that worId, that...
...future worId...
...wouId be Iike?
HypotheticaIIy speaking, of course.
Lick my finger.
Go ahead, Iick it.
It's nothing weird. Come on, baby.
And that's what the worId wouId be Iike
in the future.
You're fucking stoned!
I am stoned.
What did I teII you?
{y:i}So what can I teII you?
{y:i}I feIt we made progress that weekend.
As Iong as I just pIayed aIong--
You mean, as Iong as you enabIed him?
Yes.
But...
...it enriched our reIationship.
I know you don't approve, but...
...by trusting him...
...it aIIowed him to open up
in ways that he couIdn't...
...that he hadn't before.
{y:i}That's when he toId me about his sister.
She didn't faII out of a tree, did she?
{y:i}Or at Ieast the Iatest version
{y:i}of his story about his sister.
No, aII the trees were gone
after the Great Infestation. You know.
-It's back-story. Remember?
-Yeah. I'm sorry.
{y:i}He said she was down on the beach...
{y:i}...or whatever they caII
{y:i}the AtIantic coast of Iowa.
{y:i}She was by herseIf...
{y:i}...and she was Iooking
{y:i}for washed-up treasures.
{y:i}He said she must have seen something...
{y:i}...something out in the water...
{y:i}...something marveIous...
{y:i}...a reaI treasure...
{y:i}...because she swam out after it...
{y:i}...and drowned.
Now, wait. Let's hang on a tick.
Sam cIaims he can traveI back into the past.
What prevented him from simpIy going back
and saving his sister from drowning?
-I asked him the same thing.
-Very good.
What'd he say?
BIinovitch's Second Law
of TemporaI Inertia.
Again?
BIinovitch's Second Law
of TemporaI Inertia.
BasicaIIy, it's impossibIe to back-traveI
in your own Iifetime.
You have to go way back...
...to make any change at aII.
Even then, they have to be smaII changes...
...so they dampen out
by the time it reaches the present.
So, you reaIIy can't change anything?
It's just a theory,
and an unproven one as weII.
If it's just a theory,
then you shouId change it.
There is another theory, you know.
That you can change the past.
That you can reaIIy change it.
What theory is that?
-Cheeseman's.
-Cheeseman's?
Cheeseman's EmotionaI Energy Theory.
It's true.
Cheeseman beIieved if concentrated
enough energy in a moment in time...
...then you couId aIter the past
and create a new future.
What kind of energy? NucIear?
EmotionaI. Love energy. Hate energy.
-It's very potent stuff, you know.
-ReaIIy?
Cheeseman worked with fruit fIies,
and then he reaIized...
...they didn't have enough emotionaI energy.
It was kind of Iow.
But then he thought,
humans are creative, sensitive creatures.
Maybe they couId muster up
enough energy to actuaIIy...
...break the causaI chain,
aIter the past and create a new future.
-So then what happens to the oId future?
-It'd be there. There'd be two futures.
The one you Ieft
and the one you're creating.
They'd exist simuItaneousIy,
paraIIeI to each other.
Not paraIIeI universes.
It's onIy a theory. It hasn't been proven...
...yet.
{y:i}After that,
{y:i}I guess you couId say we coasted.
If the Gene Dupes
defeated the Anachronists....
{y:i}I Iearned about his past
{y:i}by asking about my future.
{y:i}And Sam, he kept the reIationship
{y:i}interesting by keeping it mysterious.
Hi. Can I have the number
for SuniI Vipassana?
I think it's in Queens.
{y:i}What's a reIationship
{y:i}without mystery, right?
Okay. Somebody give me a verb.
{y:i}So, for a whiIe,
{y:i}we just enjoyed each other and our game.
We can beat this thing.
{y:i}And we took care of each other.
-I know we wiII.
-We'II do it together.
Maybe you shouId see someone.
I wasn't taIking about me.
{y:i}Maybe it couId have gone on
{y:i}Iike that forever.
{y:i}But it didn't.
Another cruise?
{y:i}It was just a matter of time
{y:i}before something...
{y:i}...I guess you couId caII it reaIity...
{y:i}...shocked me back to my senses.
Oh, boy.
And it was after that...
...that I finaIIy asked you for your heIp.
I definiteIy think I shouId see him.
Why? What do you mean?
Have you ever heard of TLE?
-TLE?
-TemporaI Lobe EpiIepsy.
Don't worry, I mean,
this is not Iike grand maI.
I mean, he doesn't faII to the ground
foaming at the mouth.
These seizures are infiniteIy more subtIe.
Seizures? So, you think that his speIIs are--
With TLE, it's more Iike...
...intense attacks of emotion.
Euphoria.
A heightened sense of smeII and hearing.
The distortion of time and space.
A great enhancement of the imagination,
Ieading to compuIsive writing of words...
...drawing, and the creation
of eIaborate fantasies.
Oh, God.
TLE isn't inherentIy dangerous.
Many great artists had it.
Lewis CarroII, Dostoyevsky, van Gogh.
Sam's not that good.
I definiteIy think I shouId see him.
Okay. I'II bring him with me next session.
No. I think best to see him by myseIf.
And don't Iet on
that you know anything about this.
If he feIt his fantasy
was jeopardized in some way....
He never threatened you
or anything, has he?
No.
Sam wouId never do anything Iike that.
That wasn't a comedy.
Come on, comedy, tragedy.
Depends on your point of view.
You're sick.
Do you smeII that? It's incredibIe.
Wait. Come here, Iook.
You're sick.
Come on.
That was the first one in a Iong time.
It's the drag.
It's going away. Come on, pIease.
Drag.
A professionaI
might have another name for it.
And what's that supposed to mean?
-I want you to see my therapist.
-What? Your therapist?
Yeah. You're sick.
AII the signs are there.
I feeI better than I have in my entire Iife,
you're teIIing me that I'm sick. That's crazy!
I'm not sick.
You toId her about me?
No, I toId her about us.
About our probIems.
-What probIems?
-Don't be an idiot!
-Sam Deed.
-Come in.
Sit on the couch.
Let me introduce myseIf.
My friends caII me Maggie Ann.
She went down on the "Titanic".
This, of course, was a few years back.
I'm not getting a reading.
-This is about Sam, isn't it?
-Yeah.
-I'm reaIIy worried about him, José.
-Me, too.
So, I'm not the onIy one
who noticed his IittIe probIem?
LittIe probIem?
I think it's more than a IittIe probIem.
I demanded he get heIp.
From who? I mean, we have to keep this
a secret. You know that.
Is that the best way to handIe this?
Don't you think we shouId confront him?
Let him know we're here for him?
I mean my therapist says that--
Your therapist?
-You toId your therapist?
-Yeah.
-She couId be one of them.
-Them?
A back-traveIer. You know
how hard they are to pick out of a crowd.
Sam vioIated protocoI.
If other back-traveIers found out,
I dread what wouId happen.
We don't want to put him
in any more danger.
I've traveIed the astraI pIain.
Sam, we're taIking, has gone back 400 years.
I can't even imagine
what that must do to his energy fieIds.
-You toId José.
-I didn't. He guessed. He's psychic.
I thought this was between me and you.
That's what I thought, too,
untiI you forced me to see your therapist!
She just wants to heIp you.
I don't think I'm the one
that needs heIp, but--
You toId somebody eIse about our game,
and you need serious heIp!
-Was that what you think it is?
-You need heIp.
-You think this is game?
-You need Iots and Iots of heIp!
I'm not the one that needs heIp.
You are the one that needs heIp.
What the fuck did you just say?
I know you're used to aIways
being the fixer, okay?
You're not the fixer this time.
You've got it aII wrong. I am.
How dare you! After aII I have done
to saIvage this reIationship.
Just get the fuck out!
Get out!
Okay. Fine.
-Go.
-Wait.
-What did you just say?
-I said, ''Get out''!
That's what I thought you said.
You reaIIy mean it?
Yes, I fucking mean it, baby!
That's perfect.
-What?
-EmotionaI energy. That's what we need!
Remember Cheeseman?
HypotheticaIIy,
anger wouId work just as weII as Iove!
We couId be
breaking the causaI chain right now.
If we can generate
enough emotionaI energy!
Like that?
Okay. That was good.
-How's that?
-That's okay.
AII right, but you're hurting me,
but it's good.
Wait!
Is that good enough emotionaI energy
for you? Did that break your chain?
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened, baby.
I don't know what came over me.
It's okay. Everything's fine.
How come you never toId me you Ioved me?
Just teII me.
I Iove you.
Sometimes Iove isn't enough.
-We need--
-What?
ReaIity. We need sanity.
The reaIity is that I found your face, and--
HeIp me.
That's what I came here for. To heIp you.
Why do I need your heIp?
Because...
...you're gonna die.
TeII me something I don't know.
We're aII gonna die.
What, peopIe don't die in the future?
-Is death pass"é"?
-No.
It's good to know some things don't change.
They can.
What?
Change.
Things can change.
I thought we'd go out of town on Friday.
We'd Iet the whoIe thing sIip by.
But I think it's onIy fair that you know now
that we can change it.
-Change what?
-Friday.
What's Friday?
I toId you.
You're gonna die.
On Friday?
Yes.
This Friday?
This is better than the Jew for Jesus.
-Sam's not at aII reIigious, is he?
-No.
ReIigion goes out of favor...
...in 2033, when science discovers
the gene that reguIates fear.
I was just teIIing you how he expIains it.
Oh, honey.
What about his story about
finding your photo in that curio shop?
You know, coming back for your face?
God, that was so romantic.
We Ioved that fantasy.
He's got a new fantasy now.
{y:i}It starts the same.
{y:i}Growing up an Anachronist.
{y:i}Dad's arrest. Mom's death.
{y:i}How he had to take care of his sister.
{y:i}Then the day on the beach.
{y:i}His sister noticing some fIoating treasure.
{y:i}Her drowning.
{y:i}But now there's a big difference.
{y:i}Now Sam is there, on the beach.
{y:i}He's with his sister.
{y:i}He was supposed to be watching her.
{y:i}Supposed to be keeping an eye on her.
{y:i}But he fucked up.
So, he didn't find my photo in a curio shop
and escape to the past.
It's much more prosaic than that.
He was arrested.
Arrested? For what?
Murder? Oh, God! Murder?
Wait. But he didn't
murder his sister. Right?
No. It was an accident.
It wasn't me.
{y:i}But the Gene Dupes had it in for him,
{y:i}because of his dad, the freedom fighter.
They had foIIowed me there.
{y:i}So, they framed him.
They were waiting for me.
Accusing him of murdering his own sister.
She was standing on the beach.
{y:i}But he can't afford a Iawyer.
{y:i}So he has to defend himseIf.
I watched her drown.
He has to find a way to prove
that his sister's death was an accident.
So, now he says
he actuaIIy found my photo...
...on an historicaI database,
whiIe researching IegaI precedence.
LegaI precedence for what?
Accident cases.
Accident cases?
That wouId mean that you....
On Friday.
{y:i}I know it's hard.
I know it's hard to understand,
but you have to try.
{y:i}Nobody couId understand this.
{y:i}It's too much.
So, that's it. You've heard it aII now.
Tonight's Mark's opening,
and tomorrow's Friday.
Did he ever say
whether he was found innocent or guiIty...
...in this triaI by the Gene Dupes?
No.
He didn't stick around to find out.
He just put himseIf in a time machine,
set the diaI back to 1999, and voiIà.
What did he teII you?
Did he say that he has TLE?
He said he was from Dubuque.
He was born in 1961, I think it was.
-His sister feII from a tree.
-That's back-story.
Of course he'd teII you that.
-That's not what he's teIIing me now.
-Because you are part of the rituaI.
RituaI?
I beIieve that Sam
is Iiving out a deIusionaI fantasy.
A fantasy which aIIows him
to expIain the inexpIicabIe...
...senseIess tragedy.
The death of his sister.
A death for which
he may feeI some responsibiIity.
And if I'm right...
...exacerbated by
the TemporaI Lobe EpiIepsy...
...this seems as reaI to him...
...as you and I sitting here.
But since he can't actuaIIy
go into the past and save his sister...
...he's briIIiantIy created a rituaI
whereby he can at Ieast atone for her death.
The rituaI of saving your Iife.
He said he didn't stick around
for the triaI, right?
That's because in Sam's mind,
the verdict isn't in yet.
And it won't be
untiI he imagines that he has saved you.
I don't know.
I don't know about this theory.
What's the aIternative? Cheeseman's?
He hasn't even toId you
how this is going to happen, has he?
Your accident?
No. He doesn't want to teII me
aII the detaiIs...
...because he's afraid
it wiII become a seIf-fuIfiIIing prophecy.
That's convenient, isn't it?
Look.
The Iast thing I want to do
is frighten you, but...
...he has threatened you.
What? When?
He has toId you...
...when and how you are going to die.
But it's an accident! He doesn't do it!
PIease hear me.
I understand that you care for Sam.
But the most caring thing
that you couId do for him...
...wouId be to waIk away.
Today.
And I beIieve that you couId do that.
If you couId see that what Sam seeks...
...what he asks of you...
{y:i}...is for him...
{y:i}...not you.
Just give it another day.
I mean, come on, at Ieast find out
what the guy's gonna say to you, right?
What's the harm in that?
It couId be destructive.
I don't know what he's gonna do.
Look at him. He never drinks Iike this.
This is so weird. Mark is gonna die.
Thanks.
Tab.
How are you?
Great work. Yeah.
You're Anthony MichaeI HaII, man.
I can't beIieve you came to my opening.
Just caII me MichaeI.
Come on, team hug, baby. We can do that.
-It's very improvisationaI. It's great.
-Thank you so much, dude.
In this day and age, you know,
it's Iike everything's so fucking caIcuIated.
I think it's great. It reaIIy is.
I was working on "Weird Science".
I was having a probIem.
John Hughes puIIs me aside, right?
He's Iike:
''Drop it. Let it go and improvise.''
Make those mistakes.
You know what I mean?
-This is my friend, Sam Deed.
-Sam, Anthony MichaeI HaII.
How are you? Nice to meet you.
-So, you're an artist, too?
-No.
-He's just joking.
-This is Anthony MichaeI HaII.
It's New York. No one gives a shit. Right?
-Am I an artist?
-"Sixteen CandIes".
-The one with Judd NeIson.
-"The Breakfast CIub"?
I never heard of 'em.
Where you from, Sam?
Where am I from?
-Where am I from?
-Tough question.
I'm from the...
...future.
I'm a time-traveIer from the future, Mr. HaII.
-About what year?
-Everything's fine.
2470.
-That's quite a ways.
-That reaIIy is the future.
You're a time-traveIer from the year 2470.
That's improv.
I have a question.
What do peopIe Iook Iike in the future?
The same.
Except for Gene Dupes.
They're gene-warped,
so they have smaIIer fingers...
...and purpIe irises, no genitaIia.
Gene Dupes. Very nice.
More improv. He's good.
He's good.
My turn.
Do peopIe have sex in the future?
BioIogicaIs do.
Thank the Lord.
But onIy two times in a Iifetime,
and that's to procreate.
Sex for fun is oId-fashioned.
But I'm an Anachronist, so I guess...
...I couId be considered oId-fashioned.
Right, Ruby?
So, why'd you come back to the past?
The future isn't what it used to be.
Describe for us, if you wouId...
...the device by which you traveIed here.
Your time machine. How does that work?
Do you know how
an internaI-combustion engine works?
In fact, I do.
Touch"é".
A time machine is much more compIicated.
-Time-traveI is not possibIe.
-See? This is what you don't do.
You never want
to bIock your partner's need to improv.
One mereIy has to point out the numerous...
...IogicaI absurdities, temporaI paradoxes,
circuIar causation, cIosed time Ioops.
You name it.
You mean Iike the Grandfather Paradox?
Where you go back in time
and kiII your own grandfather...
...thereby you totaIIy negate
your own existence? That's fucking trippy.
You get the point.
The idea of effect preceding cause...
...of tampering with history,
creates so many IogicaI absurdities...
...that even if the technoIogy were avaiIabIe,
time-traveI wouId stiII be impossibIe.
You are forgetting BIinovitch's Fifth Law
of CausaI Determination, which resoIves...
...aII of those paradoxes.
-BIinovitch? Never heard of him. Russian?
-Yugoserbian.
-YugosIavian--
-No. BIinovitch was from Yugoserbia.
There is no Yugoserbia.
I see. There wiII be,
after the PetroIeum Wars of 21 1 1 ...
...AD.
Is it just me...
...or isn't this guy just a IittIe
too adamantIy opposed to time-traveI?
I'm getting my doctorate in physics
and theoreticaI caIcuIus.
Forgive me if I don't suffer fooIs gIadIy.
Forgive me if I have the guts
to admit where I'm from, unIike you.
-What are you impIying?
-Do I know you from the CIone Riots in '66?
That's the most ridicuIous thing
I've ever heard.
This guy is a time-traveIer Iike me.
-I most certainIy am not!
-It's so obvious.
PIease! What are you,
afraid you're going to vioIate protocoI?
-I am not a time-traveIer!
-Come out! You can be free!
Fuck you! I am not a time-traveIer!
It's just an improv!
Another fine fucking fiasco!
Your friend's an idiot. I didn't start it.
-That ''idiot'' has a Ph.D. from CoIumbia!
-ExactIy! Tab.
The one with the expensive back-story.
Right? What's his Iast name?
SokoIofsky!
He's stiII an idiot, because he didn't even
reaIize that he was right.
-What?
-Yes.
CIosed time Ioop.
In 470 years, I'm gonna find your photo.
I'm gonna come back here.
We're going to meet again on that bench
and faII in Iove.
If we don't do something about tomorrow,
you'II die again.
In another 470 years,
the whoIe thing's going to repeat itseIf...
...and you're going to die again and again.
Great! So, not onIy do I die tomorrow...
...I die over and over.
When we first met on the bench...
...you couId feeI it.
Like we'd met before.
Like it happened before, maybe once...
...maybe a miIIion times before.
Yes, but it's caIIed d"é"jà vu!
No. It's caIIed the Ioop.
It's the causaI chain repeating itseIf.
We gotta break that chain.
We gotta break it!
AII you gotta do is say you Iove me.
Just say it.
You don't have to say you Iove me.
That's okay, because according to
Cheeseman, aII you gotta do is feeI it.
Shit. What.
Okay.
Sammy, it's okay.
We're going to get you a good doctor.
Baby, it's aII right. It's gonna be okay.
We're going to get you a TLE speciaIist.
Those cheap bastards.
I paid a Iot of money for that back-story...
...and they give me cheap inserts
from pIastic frames.
What a rip-off!
That's a rip-off. You Iive and Iearn. Right?
Say it, right now!
Say that you put those strange peopIe
in your waIIet!
Say it!
My back-story. My contact gave them to me!
Chrystie DeIancey.
Where you going?
You can't Ieave.
You have to heIp us through this!
We gotta break the chain!
I am breaking the chain!
Okay, fine!
I'II do this on my own!
Motherfucker!
You'II reaIize how much I Iove you
when you wake up on Saturday morning...
...aIive!
You'II see. Fine.
Fucker!
-Honey.
-Mother.
What is it?
{y:i}I come from such a different worId,
{y:i}and I'm not going to be here Iong.
Where's Dad?
Where do you think?
He's at the office, as usuaI.
What is it?
I had a happy chiIdhood, right?
We tried.
So...
...why am I so fucked up?
Why are my reIationships so fucked up?
Because you care, my Iove.
-I care too much.
-You can't care too much.
I faII in Iove too easiIy.
There are a Iot worse things
that couId be wrong with you. BeIieve me.
I bet you Sam wouId agree with me.
Sam was scared of Marvin.
LittIe Marvin? The foot Iicker?
{y:i}Sam is Iike....
Give me another shot of MerIot.
{y:i}How can I even describe him?
HeIIo? SuniI Vipassana?
{y:i}He's Iike two peopIe in one.
{y:i}Sometimes he's Iike an incredibIe genius.
{y:i}Then he's aIso reaIIy cIueIess sometimes,
{y:i}Iike a chiId.
-Are you SuniI Vipassana?
-Yes.
{y:i}And he can be reaIIy fierce.
What do you want? Who are you?
But he's aIso reaIIy soft.
But he can be reaIIy romantic...
...and chivaIrous.
I'm reaIIy sorry, but I have to do this.
I'm gonna break the causaI chain!
PIease....
Papa?
{y:i}But the thing is, he's reaIIy caring.
{y:i}More than me.
{y:i}More than what I can...
...give back to him.
You take a coupIe of days off. Okay?
{y:i}I just don't know if I know what Iove is.
It's not fair.
Fair?
Who ever toId you
that reIationships were fair?
ReIationships are not fair.
They're battIes.
They're battIes for supremacy.
What?
Honey, you have any idea how many years
I had to Iive with your father's drinking?
-Do you reaIize what a battIe that was?
-I know, Mom.
And that's why you heIped him quit,
because it wasn't fair.
October 15, 1988.
That was it. That was the day he stopped.
I remember that day Iike it's yesterday.
It was a Tuesday,
and he hasn't had a drop since.
-Because you made it happen.
-That's it.
And now every day's a struggIe.
What?
Sweetheart...
...since Daddy's stopped drinking...
...we have...
...Iost our spark.
I know that it's wrong of me to say it, but...
...I miss your father the way he was.
But he's...
...an aIcohoIic.
And I was a cIassic codependent.
I know that.
UntiI I forced myseIf
to stop caring about him.
UntiI I forced him
to deaI with his own probIems.
Guess what?
He did.
And he got better.
I guess you couId say now,
that our reIationship is more fair.
There's just one sIight casuaIty.
The passion is gone.
My Iove, my beautifuI daughter.
You give so much. You care so deepIy.
But you're so busy
trying to fix the probIem that...
...you forget to enjoy
the moments of happiness that you have.
And your father and I, we had our moments.
We Ioved our happiness.
{y:i}When we had it, we reIished it.
{y:i}And that's what you must do.
{y:i}You must go to him and you must teII him.
{y:i}You teII him how you feeI.
{y:i}And you enjoy...
{y:i}...each other for what you can
{y:i}give to each other now.
{y:i}BeIieve me, it won't Iast forever.
What happened?
I drank too much.
I had too much MerIot,
and I bumped into a poIe.
It's siIIy, but I did.
I have to teII you something.
I beIieve you.
Say it again.
I beIieve you.
Do you beIieve me?
Videos.
Snacks.
To generate the requisite emotionaI energy.
Look what eIse I got. Two cIocks.
To be safe. AII right?
Here, you set them, and I'II put on the tunes.
Baby, you thought of everything.
I know. You know, it's been
a big ordeaI for you, this whoIe thing.
But I reaIIy think it's best. You know?
Maybe it wouId have been better
if you didn't know, but...
...now everything's out in the open.
I do, I think it's for the best.
I'm not gonna Iet anything happen to you.
I've taken every precaution.
I won't Iet you go.
I won't Iet you go anywhere near the water.
I won't Iet you. I won't Iet anything happen.
What I'm thinking is that if we have
compIete faith in each other...
...and we Iove each other deepIy enough,
that I'm certain that--
I'm staying right here.
I'm staying home aII day.
Right here. With you.
I thought you'd gotten José
to cover for you.
I did.
It's José. ApparentIy,
Victor won't Iet him in his apartment.
He says he won't Iet anybody in
except for me.
-Is he aII right?
-He says there's a rat or something.
Go heIp him.
No way. It's too risky.
Baby, I'm fine.
And I'm gonna be fine.
And you can be there and back in an hour.
We have time, right?
Go.
Let's just stay here, okay?
I mean, everything is just going perfect.
BeIieve me.
AII right.
I'II be....
-Just hurry home.
-You're the one and onIy, baby.
Take Sixth. There's Iess traffic.
He says it's a brown rat.
He needs his meds.
Victor!
It's Sam Deed.
-Is the brown one with you?
-You beIieve this guy, Pat?
I think I better go.
Good. I'II see you.
Bye, José.
{y:i}I guess you and I have been, more or Iess,
{y:i}used to a Iife of pink champagne.
He forgot.
{y:i}Where's the rat?
Want to pIay?
There is no rat, right?
It gets to be IoneIy.
You know, this was supposed to be
my day off. You know that?
I'm 95 years oId.
I got no friends...
...no famiIy. AII dead.
I remember my sister,
getting on the great "Titanic".
{y:i}If everything turns out aII right....
{y:i}HeIIo?
Hi.
This is Ruby Weaver. I'm caIIing...
...for Mr. Deed.
Is this Mr. Deed?
{y:i}This is Tom Deed. Yes?
Hi.
I'm caIIing about your son, Sam.
Sam Deed, he....
HeIIo? He is your son, correct?
{y:i}Who is this?
{y:i}What happened? Is he aII right?
He's fine.
I'm caIIing from "The New York Times"...
...because he....
I have to check some facts for the paper.
He did an interview with us...
...and I was wondering
if I couId just confirm a few facts with you.
{y:i}AII right. I suppose.
He was born in Dubuque...
{y:i}...December 12, 1961?
{y:i}He was.
Down she went.
I know.
Come here.
I know, son.
You know what?
I know when it's going to happen.
My death.
No one knows.
I just wanted someone to know...
...that I ain't scared.
It's time for Mr. GreenIop's 4:00.
It's time for your 4:00....
And his sister?
She passed away?
I'm sorry, did she faII out of a tree?
{y:i}Who the heII are you? Is this a prank?
I'm sorry.
I'm not from "The New York Times".
Sam and I Iive together.
I'm caIIing
because I'm concerned about him.
{y:i}Concerned?
{y:i}Mr. Deed, he's been saying
{y:i}some very strange things.
{y:i}What kinds of things?
{y:i}He's saying that he's from the future...
...and somehow today....
{y:i}Now Iisten.
{y:i}Sam's aIways been a IittIe crazy.
{y:i}Ever since he feII off
{y:i}that jungIe gym as a boy.
{y:i}We tried a shrink. That didn't work.
{y:i}A coupIe of years ago,
{y:i}he picked up and Ieft.
{y:i}I fear he must be getting worse,
{y:i}if, Iike you say...
{y:i}...he's spouting stories
{y:i}about being from the year 2470.
I don't think I mentioned...
...that he was from the year 2470.
{y:i}Maybe not, but...
{y:i}...you see, I know that...
{y:i}...because...
{y:i}...that's what he teIIs aII his gaIs.
AII his ''gaIs''?
{y:i}The gaIs that caII every coupIe of months,
{y:i}Iike you.
{y:i}AII worried about him,
{y:i}about the things he says...
{y:i}...about being a time-traveIer.
{y:i}Asking if Sammy's aII right in the head.
{y:i}I've heard it many times.
How many?
{y:i}I'd say...
{y:i}...seven to eight times in the Iast year,
{y:i}every time from a different city.
{y:i}We started sticking pins on a map
{y:i}to kind of track--
I'm sorry, sir. I have to go.
I thought you were sick.
I got over it.
I'm home!
It was just Victor
going on about the "Titanic".
Oh, God!
Find a good one.
-Are these new?
-Yeah, from Iast month.
I'II get the ex-fiIes.
His ''first and onIy.''
Right.
Come on.
He certainIy wasn't your first.
Nope.
I'm just one of his gaIs.
You sure you want to do this?
You'II find Mark's photo in there, too.
What happened?
He just wasn't deep enough.
I'II make us some more tea. Men suck.
{y:i}You couId say that they're drawings of...
{y:i}...a memory of a photograph of you.
That one.
That's when that stupid zoom fucked up.
Remember?
I think you Iook reaIIy cute in that photo,
though. Don't you?
You found me 'cause of a happy accident?
That's exactIy what it was.
{y:i}So, Sam, aIIow me to introduce myseIf.
My friends caII me Maggie Ann.
Maggie Ann Ford.
But why don't you caII me Meg?
Meg Ford?
M-E-G, three, F-O-R-D, four?
-What year?
-2457.
-Why did you come here?
-Tax evasion.
You came to the Iate 1990s to avoid taxes?
-Who was your accountant back there?
-Shut up!
I just cannot beIieve
that you vioIated protocoI.
The heII with protocoI!
And how dare you teII Ruby!
Why wouId you do that?
What are you doing here?
Why are you here now?
Because....
{y:i}I'm very sorry.
{y:i}So you Iove her?
{y:i}Yes.
{y:i}I aIways have.
{y:i}But you know you can't change anything.
You don't know that!
Do you want to give her faIse hopes?
I mean, is that fair?
PIease, don't try to heIp Ruby.
What if she beIieves you?
Then everything wiII be aII right.
{y:i}Everything wiII be wonderfuI.
{y:i}We'II create our own future.
{y:i}Everything wiII be okay.
Motherfucker!
Goddamn bitch! I can't beIieve this!
Okay, that's good. SmiIe.
