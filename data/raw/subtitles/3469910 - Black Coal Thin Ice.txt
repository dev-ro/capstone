And Now For Something Completely Different
Special thanks to an amazing Woman
- the Woman of my life,...
who found the English subtitles
for this movie
when she was flying home to me.
Thank you, honey!
And thanks to my Chinese friend 孟繁琼 (Meng Fanqiong),
for translating the missing bits into English.
Year 1999
There's problem on Line 3A!
Shut it down!
You're free.
Yeah.
Yake care.
Here.
Don't be like this.
Let go.
Let go!
It's over, we agreed!
Let go!
Get away from me!
You're insane!
Certificate of Divorce
This is the worst case I've seen.
Body parts being dumped,
scattered acros the whole province.
Rumors of corpses in coal piles,
everyone scared to come to work.
If you can't crack this case...
I found something!
Liang Zhijun!
His name is Liang Zhijun!
I've got bloody clothes and a worker ID!
Rong Rong Laundry
Your husband's dead.
We understand your pain.
But the more you can tell us
about your husband Liang Zhijun,
the faster we can crack this case.
No point in crying.
You're just wasting time.
We need your cooperation.
Take a good look.
Is that him?
Yes, that's Liang Zhijun.
He wasn't a talkative guy.
I used to beat him at chess.
He worked at the coal scales here
for 8 years, and never made any enemies.
Last time you saw Liang Zhijun
did you notice anything strange?
Neh, it was shift change.
His locker's over there.
Coal weighing station
I asked around.
Most drivers deliver coal...
to the same one or two factories.
But this one guy,
Liu Fayin,
made deliveries to a dozen plants
around the time of the murder.
Seems fishy.
Plus,...
they're the same factories where the body parts turned up.
But we're talking 15 factories,
in 6 different cities and counties.
Even if he drove
for 3 days stright,
there's no way he could hit
all those places.
Unless he had help.
I checked.
He's got a younger brother.
He used to take him on rounds.
Until he quit two days ago.
You're Liu Fayin?
Police.
Come with us.
Where are you going?!
Stop!
Zhang!
Zhang, let go!
Let go!
Qiangjun!
Cuff these two together.
Frisk him first.
Cuffs locked?
On your knees!
Over here.
Squat!
Know why we're here?
Huh?
Speak up!
Come on!
Why'd you run?
Why'd you run?
Answer him.
Tell us what you did!
All right, all right.
Take them in for questioning.
I'll deal with you later.
Idiot!
Enough.
Go get the car.
This is police business. Get out of here.
Go on.
That goes for you, too.
That's his jacket?
I'll check.
It's me.
Just me.
- Thanks.
- You take care, now.
- And be careful.
- Okay.
Goodbye.
- Bye.
- Take care.
What's with you?
Those quacks mess with your head?
I was just thinking
of Qiangjun and Xueyi.
I missed their funerals.
Maybe I should visit their families.
No, they're still getting over it.
Best not upset them.
We'll go for a massage later.
First I have to drop something off.
Rong Rong Laundry
Took you long enough.
She's burying Liang Zhijuan'a ashes.

5 years later
Hey buddy!
Buddy!
You drunk?
You shouldn't be out so late.
What's wrong?
I'm fine!
Motherfucker…
Not my bike!
Here's what's left of the noodels, officer.
I need to see everyone's ID.
Where's the waiter?
Poor kid's so scared, he's hiding in the back.
Don't breathe a word of this.
How could this happen?
I ate half before I realized.
I thought it was beef.
I demand compensation.
Don't give me that.
I'm a victim here, too!
Shut up!
Crybaby!
You, in back!
You're from Team 2?
Line up.
What brings you in today, boss?
Just wanted to help out.
Not likely!
And see your pretty face.
Don't worry, there's enough to go around
- Your new uniform and gloves.
- Isn't Team 3 here?
- No.
Not here, eh?
You hung over again?
And why so late?
Some fucker…
…stole my bike.
Listen Zhang,
since you transferred to our security team,
you've been hung-over every day.
You think being shot in the line of duty
merits special treatment?
Just look at that mop.
Like a dog licked it.
You need a wife to look after you.
Anyone want to help Zhang find a wife?
We've got one here!
What are you doing?
Stop it
Who'd marry this drunk?
Oh good, he reeks.
If a man's not a boozer, in bed he's a loser!
Your typical bullshit!
Besides, I got a man at home.
Not as good as me!
Kiss her! Kiss her!
How goes it, Detective Wang?
I hear they promoted you to white-collar crime.
You heard wrong. I'm here on a stakeout.
You are?
Sorry to interrupt.
I didn't say you had to leave.
So, how you been?
I've been better.
You can talk. He's one of us.
These are photos from the recent murder
and the 2001 case.
Both vics were romanticaly linked
to this woman.
The 2001 vic disappeared
the day before the wedding.
The second was killed right
after he started dating her.
Where'd they work?
Both former factory workers
who quit to go into business.
And the crime scenes?
It snowed right after.
No clues at either scene.
Both vics were wearing ice skates.
I think they were killed while skating outdoors.
Someone's leaving.
Slow down. Not too close.
- Hey, Zhang!
- Yeah?
Remember that coal scale operator?
Liang Zhijun?
This is his wife.
Wu Zhizhen, the laundress.
So counting Liang Zhijun,
she's connected to three murders.
Seems that way.
Every man she's with ends up dead.
Rong Rong Laundry
I want these dry-cleaned.
How much?
Thirty yuan.
And some new tenants, southerners,
moved into the fifth floor flat.
They're in sales, I think.
Probably not a pyramid scheme,
but I'll keep an eye on them, anyway.
We appreciate your vigilance.
Glad I could help, Officer Wu.
Anytime you need to keep tabs on someone,
just let me know.
Right.
This is Detective Wang, crime squad.
He wants to ask you something.
Nice to meet you, detective.
How can I be of help?
Never mind her.
Go on, detective.
Maybe we can talk outside.
Okay.
What on earth?
Who brought a horse in here?
It's been wandering around the neighborhood.
It looked cold and hungry,
so the neighbors brought it in.
Who's the owner?
Scrap collector, I think.
But no one's seen him in days.
Mrs. Lu, over here.
I need information about someone.
Who?
You know He Mingrong, owns Rong Rong Laundry?
Sure.
And the woman who works for him, Wu Zhizhen?
I know her.
What's their relationship?
You can pick these up…
day after tomorrow.
- What time?
- Afternoon.
See you then.
What'd you do to these?
What's wrong?
Look at this.
The button's missing.
Oh, sorry.
Let me sew it back on.
You been open five, six years?
Ought to start a franchise.
Who can afford to?
If not a franchise,
another mom-and-pop shop.
It's not that simple.
She's my type,
but I'm not hers.
Don't get the wrong idea.
I just feel sorry for her.
She's had it hard, ask anyone.
When we first opened in '99,
she managed to ruin a leather coat.
Then her husband died,
suddenly.
Couldn't bring myself to fire her.
It's a tough business, this.
And guess what.
That guy wanted her to pay
28,000 for the coat.
Back in '99, a fortune.
Next to that, a button's nothing.
But she got lucky.
The guy bugged her for a week,
then never came back.
Couple days ago,
I was cleaning up, and found the coat.
I thought about returning it.
But didn't know whom to.
And you changed your mind?
I figured, why go looking for trouble?
Stop following me.
Stay out of trouble, that's my motto.
All done.
Thanks.
Hey, there.
So, is it the both of you?
Wht are you doing?
What's going on?
Know all the tricks, do you?
He only paid me 100.
Nothing happened.
Just trying on dresses.
Trying on what?
Dresses.
He had me try on different of dresses...
I thought he was in fashion,
but I guess he's a pervert.
What kind of pervert?
How would I know?
We were just joking around.
Well, we're not.
Let's go.
Wait, I didn't do anything!
Can't we talk this over?
Laundry delivery.
Today's the fire drill
was organized by our security team.
You all know what to expect,
so take your jobs seriously!
This is an importand drill,
people! Understand?
Understood!
Okay, let's begin!
You now how to use this?
Extinguishers at the ready!
Watch how Zhang does it.
Everyone!
I'm picking up my laundry.
Did you hear me?
I'm here for my laundry.
You're here... to pick up?
Show me. I'll get it.
That's for your hand.
Medicine and bandages. For your hand.
Wash this.
Wash your own damn sweater!
Trying to pick a fight?
Can't you see we're busy?
You know who I am?
A little shit who's leaving!
You want trouble?
You looking to die?
Try it again, I dare you!
Now fuck off!
Before I kill you!
Just wait!
Just you wait!
Stop following me.
Next time…
let's go skating outdoors.
What?
Ice-skating.
Actually...
I can't realy skate.
No matter.
I'll teach you.
I shouldn't have let you in the car that day.
And here I thought we were friends.
This is no way to get sober.
Steer clear of her.
Who says I want to get sober?
I'm just looking...
for something to do.
So my life isn't a total loss.
What?
You think anyone ever wins at life?
At least I can try.
Where do you think you're going?
You haven't returned your skates!
I want to get back.
Wait.
Turn right here and go straight.
Red Star Theatre
Stop.
Police.
Turn around.
Hands behind your back.
I hurt my arm skating.
Turn back around.
Give me your hand.
Seems a bit late to be out skating.
What are you doing here?
My skate broke.
I was taking it to be fixed.
It broke?
The other one.
Stand still.
Know why I'm arresting you?
Li,
I caught the suspect.
I'm bringing him in right now.
See you.
Let's go.
Well? Stop pushing!
You scraped my coat.
- How much?
- 5 yuan.
What can I get you?
Mutton soup.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for someone.
Paging Comrade Liang Zhijun.
Please come to the broadcast booth.
Someone is looking for you.
Paging Comrade Liang Zhijun,
Comrade Liang Zhijun…
someone is looking for you.
I had the wrong bus.
Should have been "E", not "F".
I mixed up the plates.
The bus was so crowded, I couldn't manage to…
I tried everything, Chief,
but she won't talk.
She wants to see Zhang.
Let me try.
Leave us alone.
If you keep this up,
I'll have to find a new laundry.
I had no idea were a cop.
Why'd you lie?
Who says I'm a cop?
Listen,
you've got a long life ahead of you.
I wouldn't lie about that.
Today I saw a man
dumping body parts from a bridge
over a railway junction.
Parts of my friend and fellow officer…
are probably scattered all over the country by now.
It reminded me of an unsolved case -
body parts turning up in coal piles
all over the province, on the same day.
That was in '99.
Remember that?
But who could cover that much ground
in a single day?
Know what I think?
It had to be the coal scale operator.
Every truck passed through
that weighing station.
It was the only common point.
If he loaded the parts on trucks
during the night shift,
by the next morning,
they'd be all over the province,
or burned to ashes in furnaces.
Wasn't your husband,
Liang Zhijun,
a coal scale operator?
In 1999,
he accidentaly killed someone
during his first robbery.
He decided to fake his own death,
using the victim's corpse as his stand-in,
so you'd never find him.
He managed
to fool all of you,
but he could never come back.
He got lucky.
Back then,
DNA testing wasn't widespread.
Lucky?
He's been in hiding all these years,
spying on everything I do.
It's like living a dead man.
I wanted to escape him,
but I couldn't.
He killed every man who ever loved me.
Who could I tell?
He'd kill me if I talked.
She gave him up.
Says she calls him
from the payphone on Jiefang Road.
Let's go.
I've come to see you,
but then I'll have to disappear.
This is for you.
Did you buy cigarettes?
No.
I'll go.
Not yet.
I'll get the smokes. Wait here.
Stop! Freeze!
Stop!
Stop!
Is he daed?
Was he hit?
He's dead, chief.
Stop following me.
Just let me explain…
No need.
Hear me out.
Don't be like this.
I don't want your explanations!
Don't do this.
I don't want your explanations!
I'm trying to help you!
I really do want to help you.
It's going to be okay.
One last thing.
We need to test those ashes from 5 years ago.
I threw them in the river.
The river?
You didn't keep any?
No.
I couldn't stand to look at them.
I still have some questions.
Can we talk in the car?
You're back.
It's fucking freezing out.
Then why not go home?
Hey.
Hey…
Seems it was another poor bastard killed 5 years ago.
Hey, there.
Can you clean this leather coat?
Sure.
This'll be ready…
day after tomorrow.
- Two days?
- Yeah.
Be careful with it.
Don't worry.
Give me that leather coat.
It's his.
No,
the one she ruined back in '99.
The 28,000-youan coat.
Okay, but…
Give it.
All right.
The guy never came back for it?
Nope.
And you thought of returning it?
Yeah.
So you've got his address?
Right here.
Zhao Jianping, Dragon Clothing Export, Ltd.
I'll pay you 1,000 for the coat.
No one wants it anyway.
That's my old card,
but I'd never wear a coat like that.
It's a miracle you tracked me down.
Must be five years now.
Yes, 1999.
In '99
I'd just started my clothing export business.
Gave out a lot of cards.
You're not in export anymore?
Stupid game!
It should have been mine!
My husband had a coat just like this.
The last time I saw him
was in our bar.
A woman came for him.
He left with her,
and I never saw him again.
What year was this?
99.
What month?
June, late June.
You didn't report it?
To the cops?
If a man decides to run off with his mistress,
the cops can't do shit.
I did report it, a year later.
Cops said he'd vanished.
Not likely.
Would you still
recognize the woman?
She stood at the door of the bar.
I'd never forget that face.
I'd recognize her anywhere.
This same bar?
Sure.
Even had the same name, Daylight Pyrotechnix.
Of course, we're bigger and better now.
But memories, good or bad,
never fade.
Daylight Pyrotechnix Nightclub
I brought my own bag.
I need the dress for a party later.
Goodbye.
See you later.
There's a performance tonight at the amusement park.
Want to go with me?
Sorry, I'm late.
It's fine.
Where are you taking me?
Come and see yourself.
There's no performance.
Look over there.
What'd you see?
Daylight Pyrotechnix.
Now…
I want you to take the initiative,
and tell me the whole truth.
Better me than the police.
What's that mean?
Show some initiative.
Here you go.
Enjoy it.
Thank you.
I've got to open the shop.
I'd better go.
Want to meet up again tonight?
Sure.
Same place?
We wouldn't be here
if we thought you weren't involved in the case.
I told you everything about my husband, didn't I?
We aren't here to talk about your husband.
Only about you.
I thought you know everything about me.
Listen, girl,
we want to understand everything.
Tell us everything before it's too late.
Before you go court.
I've got nothing to say.
Don't waste our time.
And don't give us bullshit.
I live at 3, Xin Street,
apartment 501.
I've worked here for 5 years
For 2,600 juan a month.
I like to read fashion magazines,
watch movies
and listen to music.
What is this? Self-advertisement?
Stop lying.
Stop telling stories
of how cruel murderer and thief
your husband was.
No one believes that.
Listen,
we have just found the ashes,
which you said you had dumped
in the river 5 years ago.
That tree is still there,
and we can easily find out
whose ashes are they
even if they grow in the tree.
Take her away.
Get up.
Up.
Let's go.
Got the coat, bro?
Remember the owner of this coat?
Does he haunt your nightmares?
His name was Li Lianqing.
Back to HQ.
I killed him.
How?
I couldn't afford to replace his coat.
So he made me go to a hotel with him.
It wasn't just once.
He mademe do awful things.
And he was brutal…
I don't remember how many times it happened.
But at some point I couldn't take it anymore.
Was Lian Zhijun involved?
No.
He sacrificed everything for me,
became a living dead man.
But I betrayed him.
Hey, you.
You there!
I brought her scarf.
Move away from the car.
What's going on?
We're on a case. What do you want?
To give her this scarf.
She's assisting our investigation.
We'll be in touch.
We couldn't have cracked this case
without Zhang's help.
A toast, to Zhang.
A toast!
Drink!
It was dumb luck.
I was stumbling around in the dark.
It was Detective Liu
who put me on the right track.
True. True.
So modest!
One, two, three… drink!
Say it again.
This big tiger escaped in California.
A big viper?
No, a big tiger!
Let's drink some more.
Detective Liu, it's your treat now!
Give me the glass.
OK, OK.
All right…
Ballroom Dancing
Long time no see.
Business trip.
Been dancing elsewhere, eh?
Lead your partner forward.
Then switch position,
like this.
We'll practice that step once more,
then run through the whole routine.
Learn any new steps?
The cops are here!
Hey, keep this area clear.
Go play somewhere else.
Okay, officer!
We'll play over there.
Hello.
Police.
Sorry to disturb you.
What's he filming? Turn that off.
Ma'am,
we're gathering evidence for a case.
The suspect lived here 5 years ago.
Is that the police? Please, come in.
They called earlier. Come on in.
Where'd you get the knife?
From the kitchen.
Show us.
Stand by the pot.
Point.
Higher.
Did you help your husband dump the body?
No.
Do you know where he dumped it?
No.
Officer Wang,
we have to visit the dump site.
Take her back to the station.
Yes, sir.
It came from up there!
