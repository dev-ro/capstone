There.
You cumming?
Cum.
Not cumming?
You cum. Cum.
I feel good, I'm good.
Go on, cum.
Go on.
Come on...
With your previous friend,
did you cum fast?
Honey.
Please talk to me.
Excuse me.
Please, I'm sorry.
Come.
Talk tomorrow?
See you Sunday?
LET THE SUNSHINE IN
Good day!
- Good morning.
- Shopping in the neighbourhood?
- Good fish here.
- Very.
How are you doing? Well?
- No.
- Me too, same old story.
We're never satisfied.
It's never all at once.
We want things to click,
but they don't.
So we satisfy our various desires
in various manners and moments,
but it never works.
I'm glad I bumped into you.
I was thinking of calling.
I wanted to suggest something
that might do you good.
Mother, who died last year,
left me a house in the Lot.
Come some time, if you like.
Whenever you want.
You can come and go...
Stay as long as you please.
I don't think so.
I'm not in great shape now.
What's going on with you?
As for me...
- ...a young woman...
- Hello, ma'am!
What'll it be?
So I'd like...
You weren't going to call?
Sorry, I couldn't.
But I was waiting all weekend.
I'm in love with you.
Take care of me, a tiny bit.
I can't always do what I want.
Listen, this is too hard.
When you say you'll call, just call.
Or this thing won't last much longer.
Dictatorship of the proletariat!
Sorry, what was that?
Say it again?
I said "dictatorship of the proletariat".
Does that annoy you?
It's annoying if you can't laugh,
but you can.
No, you can't?
Nice chair.
Did you masturbate this weekend?
- Did you?
- Nope.
You made love...
I'm married.
Or else, were there hookers?
No ice cubes.
Take that back.
Bring two empty glasses.
Not a large Perrier, a small one.
Put it down there.
I'll pour, then you can put it away.
Good, now you got it.
Excellent.
I know Maxime well.
Your new...
Your new associate.
Yes, of course I know.
We merged the two galleries.
I didn't know that.
Anyway...
I figured you knew her.
In this milieu...
And as a banker,
you must know everyone.
I knew her
before she began at the gallery.
I've known her for ages.
You may not know,
but she had a thing
with your... ex...
ex-husband, ex-spouse.
With Mandelbaum. They had a thing.
- What?
- You didn't know?
But when?
You didn't know?
I don't know when.
No, come on...
She had a thing with François?
- Says who?
- Says her.
- When did she say that?
- I don't know...
About two years ago.
At least. I can't remember.
But, when...
When I was with him, or after?
I don't know.
I'd say it was before.
She'd have told me.
Impossible.
She said it so plainly, so simply...
I don't know why she'd have lied.
Does it bother you?
I'm about to work with her.
Yes, it bothers me.
Working with her
is an amazing opportunity.
She'll show you internationally.
It's wonderful.
I don't know.
Are you sure?
That's impossible... You're wrong.
It's impossible.
She said so.
I have no reason not to believe her.
That's it.
I think it's over now.
Listen, I don't know...
Maybe.
I don't get it. It's... strange.
It's unhealthy if it's true.
You're sure?
Yes. I shouldn't have told you.
It's over now. No big deal at all.
- Put away that bottle.
- Sure.
Now. Put the bottle away now.
Yes, sir.
Do you have any gluten-free olives?
- Gluten-free olives?
- Have any?
- I'll go ask, sir.
- Thanks.
And bring me a cup of hot water.
Without lemon.
- Just very hot water, got it?
- Yes, sir.
Excellent.
Why use that tone?
He's nice.
Are you into him?
You found yourself quite a match.
You're worth more.
You don't know this but...
I admire you.
Really?
Yes.
I do.
You're an amazing woman.
This is it.
There's a man in Paris
who finds you extraordinary.
It's simple. I'd like to be you.
Yes, I would like to be you.
It's true.
You don't realise
you do the best thing in the world.
There's nothing better.
Why, you don't like what you do?
You never mention your work.
Because it's not fulfilling.
Being a banker isn't interesting?
My job is alienating.
You're lucky not to be alienated.
My banker colleagues
never read books, never go out.
Lives limited to weekends in Normandy
in little cottages with their families.
Uninteresting bourgeois types.
Not like you.
Find it funny?
So what in life interests you?
Life's pleasures.
The beauties of this world.
The gentleness of this world.
Touch this. It's a little swollen.
Don't worry. It's soft flannel.
I'll answer the question
you're not asking.
I'll never leave my wife.
You're charming,
but my wife is extraordinary.
A pain at times, even exhausting,
but extraordinary.
But you charm the pants off me.
If we play it smart, it can be nice.
Very nice.
Your hot water.
I'll stop by my office.
I feel like walking. Take my car.
My driver can drop you anywhere.
Thanks a lot, sir.
Thanks a real, real lot.
Have a nice day, bye.
Thanks, bye.
Thanks.
It's just not feasible.
Being a backstreet lover
is just unbearable.
Am I with him?
Am I with him? Am I not?
I don't know.
I'm tired.
I'm tired.
Is this my life?
I want to find a love.
One real love.
I'm running into a wall anyway.
Why couldn't it be different for once?
Why, why, Why?
I don't get it.
I'm thrilled you're joining me
at the gallery.
I'll take good care of you.
I'll do everything I can.
Whatever it takes. You'll see.
You're a great artist, you know.
Excuse me, can I ask something?
Of course, go ahead.
I'm very embarrassed, but...
I'm sorry...
- Really, I...
- Just say it.
Just say it.
Go on.
If there's something, say it.
Please.
Tell me.
So I'll tell you.
Excuse me... it's very difficult.
I'm incredibly embarrassed.
I'm really sorry.
Say it.
Listen...
This is ridiculous.
It doesn't concern me.
If I don't say it,
it'll spoil things between us.
That's it.
Go on... say it.
Yes, so I'll say it...
or it won't be good for work.
Sorry to question something
of no concern to me.
Listen...
I heard someone say... that...
you had a thing...
with François Mandelbaum.
Listen, no.
But why not in the future?
You know who told me that?
Vincent Briot.
The banker?
I'm sick of the nightly grind.
That's the theatre.
It's what makes it tough.
One-time audiences don't see it.
But the nightly grind is tough.
Good evening.
Sorry to bother you.
Congratulations.
You were amazing.
It's my second time.
I'm just as moved.
Your take on the role is... so modern.
So personal, I think.
- Thanks!
- Thank you.
Bravo. I'll be back.
He's great, isn't he?
Thank you.
It could be personal.
My own problem.
Maybe I'm tired of the daily grind.
Hence, the nightly grind.
For a personal reason.
My daily grind is a pain.
Your daily grind?
Yeah, my daily grind.
My life.
Meaning?
My life these days.
My current daily grind is a pain.
So it's the fact that...
you don't know what to do
all day long,
that your days are
empty and meaningless?
No...
My everyday life at the moment...
it's like...
it's weighing on me.
My wife and I are breaking up, so...
My life is lacking in desire.
Anyway, it'll come back.
I can have desire elsewhere
than in my life.
"Elsewhere" meaning... where?
The unknown.
The unknown?
Does your life bore you?
No, I never get bored.
I can become a houseplant. Never bored.
I drink a lot,
which causes intermediary states.
Except when I lose it.
One word is all it takes.
It can get a little...
violent.
Meaning?
At home.
Truth is...
only I know it's over with my wife.
I'm leaving, but only I know.
I let things get toxic out of cowardice.
Yep...
I'll let it get toxic.
I can't tell her it's over.
I'm afraid of what it'll trigger.
But are things really over?
I dunno...
So I'm not in control right now.
Of course, meeting you
is part of the picture.
Are we eating or not? Are you hungry?
We... It's up to you.
You hungry? Want to eat?
I'm a little hungry, yes
Weren't we supposed to eat?
To talk about our project?
I don't know...
The stuff you bring up is so...
intimate, that suddenly...
You unsettled me.
I didn't expect that.
I didn't know either.
I was just asking if...
Yes, let's go have dinner.
To talk.
Wasn't that the plan?
And we already are talking.
But...
I just wanted to say
that my personal stuff...
doesn't...
doesn't matter more
than the fact that we're meeting.
Everything is still
open and possible, but...
But?
In fact,
I suggest that we go out to dinner.
Have some drinks.
Yes... yes.
Thank you.
Can I drop you off?
- Sure.
- Yes?
So...
So...
I feel like we said nothing.
We got nowhere.
I'm just tired.
We said things...
then we said the opposite.
I'm off tomorrow.
We can go see a movie.
Well...
I'll call you.
So...
See you tomorrow.
I'll call you when I wake up
and will go to the cinema.
I don't know.
So I'll call you and we'll see.
I don't know
if you should bother calling.
Park so we can talk about it
for a minute.
No use beating around
the bush for hours.
Whatever you say.
Let's not meet again.
It's going nowhere.
What is that face?
I feel like a spurned lover, that's why.
And you don't get it.
Sol...
I don't understand...
how you can feel like a spurned lover.
Seriously,
I don't get it.
You said no use meeting again,
it's going nowhere.
- Yes, I said that.
- Yes?
And you don't see why?
No really...
I said it but...
don't listen to everything I say.
- Really?
- I see.
So there.
So there, so there.
Fine.
I feel you just want me
to get out of this car.
I'm not in any rush.
Not for you to leave.
Listen, I'm sorry,
but I really feel the only thing you want
is that I leave this car.
Nope.
So you want me to go or stay longer?
I want you to stay.
Then come in for half an hour.
You have your daughter!
No, she's at her father's.
For a week.
- I'd like a drink.
- Sure.
I don't have much.
I've got nothing.
Just this.
Is this OK?
What do you want me to say?
I don't know.
What I'm feeling?
You say it.
No...
No.
Definitely not.
So why should I?
I don't know.
How about you?
Could you do it?
Are you capable of saying it?
Would you know what to say?
Yes, I think so.
But I'd feel too naked.
At the mercy of...
- Will you show me out?
- Sure.
That feels good.
Sometimes there's no need to talk.
So what do you want?
For me to stay or go?
For you to stay.
I couldn't bear it anymore.
It feels so good
to stop all that talking.
I thought it would never end.
It's nice when it ends.
I'll shut your security door.
Where to?
Where to?
- You mean what room?
- Yes.
There? Come.
Beautiful room, Isabelle.
Talk tomorrow?
Yes.
Wonderful.
If we see each other again,
can we not make love?
We shouldn't have slept together.
Just listened to music.
This isn't a love thing.
There was ambiguity, no love.
Why did I bring up my life?
To show off? To seduce you?
But this isn't a love thing.
I just got in from Brazil
and felt like banging you.
I'm a strange guy.
Maybe you are, but I'm busy.
You're not funny.
Your offer doesn't interest me.
You didn't used to say that.
Were you crying?
I'm tired.
You won't like this,
but I'll say it anyway.
Crying is for maids.
And monkeys.
You know what happens next?
You open that door,
you leave and you never come back.
I'll open it for you.
- Leave now.
- I thought...
Stop thinking.
Don't ever come back here.
I want the last word!
I want the last word
like in a tacky bedroom farce?
You're a scumbag!
Good morning!
Well, I'll be!
Same place as last time.
I hope you're well.
Or better, or at least getting by.
I thought of two things
since the last time.
I thought of two things.
I have two proposals, both decent.
First, it would make me happy
if we had dinner sometime soon
whenever suits you.
The second thing,
I'm re-inviting you to the Lot.
Next weekend, or the 24th-25th.
Excellent contemporary art festival
in the region.
Now that the house is fixed up,
more welcoming...
I'll send my chambermaid
so we're not sullied
by household chores.
I'll spend the week, or part of it.
You spend as long as you want,
if you like.
That's very kind of you...
Mathieu.
Are you feeling better?
Yes, I'm OK.
How about you?
Without getting into details, yes, yes...
I'm happy to hear you're better.
You mean a lot to me.
That's nice.
Think over my propositions.
I'll let you call.
Remember to!
I promise!
DOWNSTAIRS
Yes?
What?
I can't hear.
There's no reception.
I'll call you back.
So...
You regret it.
Yes, I regret it.
But meeting you was unique.
Nothing like you before.
And nothing like you after.
Hooking up and regretting it
the next day,
God knows it happens often.
It's always easy to fix,
but not with you.
I regret it happened like this.
This isn't a love thing.
I wish we'd hung out a little.
Let things happen naturally.
Or not happen.
But I felt bad afterwards.
I regretted it.
How did you feel after?
- What did you think?
- Was I happy?
Yeah, how did you feel?
I felt good.
Listen...
you regret it and I don't.
Once you decide
"it's not a love thing",
you can't backtrack
like nothing happened.
If you regret it, you regret it.
We can't backtrack
and pretend nothing happened.
We can't meet up again
as if nothing happened.
Best to stop it now.
I like everything that lies ahead of us.
Not at all.
It happened. It's behind us.
Too fast.
No time to see what hit me.
We spoiled everything.
Whatever was going to happen is over,
and I like what lies ahead of us.
But now there's nothing.
Maybe not.
Maybe there still is a future.
A second chance.
Yes, of course.
First time is taken care of.
And so there's...
a before the second time?
First time is over with, right?
So there will still be
a before after?
No, it's over.
There's no other solution.
I agree.
I thought you wanted to see me again.
You said... You...
You surprise me.
I didn't think you'd agree.
You're crazy. I said I agree.
OK, fine then!
Anyway, there are no other solutions.
I'll be going.
I promised to bring home a pizza.
Long live family.
Long live family.
Yes?
Yes. Can I call you back
in a few minutes?
I'm busy.
How long till you call him back?
I told him a few minutes.
A few minutes?
What are you doing tonight?
In a few minutes?
There's a play tonight... Oh, you can't,
you told him, "In a few minutes."
I don't know.
Should I say something?
It's up to you.
Up to me.
Is it a problem if I keep quiet?
Nope, it's not.
How are you, sir?
Are you well?
Meaning?
I ask because I'm not well,
so I was wondering if you were.
I don't want to say banalities.
I want us...
to talk...
To know if you're happy.
It's not easy.
I'm going home.
I'm fed up. My day was...
very tough.
Want some music?
Or silence, maybe?
How about you?
We can put on some music.
I'll put on public radio.
It'll do us good.
I choose the moment.
Every day, I choose a moment.
A panel a day?
- Yes, every day.
- Really?
I contemplate it,
I look at the sky and choose a moment.
Sometimes I only had...
10 minutes,
because the sky was changing fast.
The weather conditions.
At most I had forty minutes
with a calmer sky
that didn't move so much.
Oh, really?
So that's your daily rule?
Yes, it was really important
that I didn't miss a day.
I think this one is more luminous.
Oh, yes, but I don't know
if this one is more graceful...
Good evening, Isabelle.
Good evening, Isabelle.
How about a drink?
I'd love one.
What?
Perrier, if you find any.
Good evening, Isabelle.
Thank you.
- Yes?
- Isabelle, I'm sad.
I can't talk.
I'm on the other line.
Can I call tomorrow?
Are you free for lunch?
- Yes...
- I'm really sad.
We can't throw this away
like old dishwater.
I'll be right back.
With the banker,
know what made me cum?
- Money?
- Not money.
Thinking that he was a bastard.
An old bastard.
I'd think "He's a bastard"
and I'd cum.
Or I imagined him with a whore.
Or with his wife.
So ugly with her lifeless face.
A real cadaver.
Him fucking her out of pity
made me cum.
Just sordid things like that.
Thinking "bastard" was enough.
At least at first...
I'd concentrate
and think "What a bastard"...
and I'd have an orgasm.
I didn't need more.
It was true, so it was easy.
Fantasies always have
an element of truth.
But I swear, Ariane, it worked.
At least at first. Afterwards...
a lot less.
Some things... I can't even tell you.
In fact he was a real shit.
It got unbearable.
I don't think I'll get through this.
It's like my love life is behind me.
It's all over.
It's all over.
There's nothing left.
That's nonsense...
- Aren't you in love with your actor?
- Yes, well...
I don't know.
There's a real problem.
Why did I leave François?
François?
- François?
- Well, François... François...
François adored you.
You have a child. That counts.
Then...
He supported you in your work.
That counts, too.
But yes, of course.
You know he called me?
- Really?
- Yes.
We met, he came over...
Did it go well?
Yeah, he spent the night.
- And so?
- We made love.
And it was...
The next morning,
I thought I was so happy,
that I was so lucky,
that my life was extraordinary!
The next day,
I realised it was the opposite.
There we go again.
We met, we spoke...
for a while, but it was the talk
of two depressed people
who met, who loved,
but who can't...
Not together, not separately...
They don't want to cause pain.
They shield each other. They lie.
They play it safe,
in case they find no one else.
They are doomed to stay together.
He asked me to go on vacation with him.
Come to Corsica.
We rented a house.
I'm going to work this summer.
Anyway...
- You make me speak, but say nothing.
- Like what?
I don't know. How are you?
Are you well?
I'm good.
Pascal and I get along better and better.
In every way.
In every way.
In every way.
Think I don't know what that means?
Yeah, right!
In every way.
In every way.
Isabelle?
Isabelle?
I'm here.
François.
Yes, what?
What was that?
That's not you.
It is. I swear, it is.
No, it's not natural.
It doesn't suit you.
Like you're watching someone do it.
Not at all.
Like you're repeating
something you saw.
That's how I see it.
Not natural. Fake.
I need to be alone.
I'm sorry, excuse me.
I can't.
CONTEMPORARY ART FESTIVAL
Beautiful, isn't it?
Gorgeous.
- Isn't it? It's gorgeous.
- Yes.
The countryside is beautiful.
Look at that house.
Where?
- Oh, yes.
- My lawyer had a country house.
Maybe it's visible.
When we still had our house in the Gard,
my wife and I paid him a visit.
It's so peaceful.
You have to be crazy
to cram onto a beach.
I always liked these hilly landscapes.
We want to buy around here, too.
Really? It's nice here. Bravo!
Bravo!
As for us,
we go to the coast and we sail.
We rent a boat,
invite some friends and travel.
We stay at sea for a few days.
Or else we stop in empty inlets.
There's no one.
It's Wild.
We've done it for years.
How lucky.
- It's very pleasant.
- Look up there!
A flock of wild geese coming down.
Now is the moment.
What fascinates me
is that this landscape is nothing.
Shapes, colours, a sunbeam.
Yet it becomes part of us
and does us good.
It's totally intact.
It's rare.
Nature that looks like nature.
All this makes me wonder
about something.
Would a 17th-century peasant
who wakes up to all his chores,
be as attuned to this beauty
as we are?
I don't agree at all.
- With what?
- It's a bad question.
- You ask it wrong.
- Yes, we know, we know!
It's all yours, all of it!
Earth, sky, mountains!
Everything, the libraries, too!
Don't worry.
We won't steal anything.
Even the birds!
The birds are yours, too.
They're leaving now,
but they'll be back!
Don't worry, it's all yours!
All of it is yours!
Everything, everything!
Everything!
Are you all right?
The landscapes are yours, too.
Did you go out on the walk?
Yes, we were freezing.
It's ice-cold here, too.
You got out of it.
I stayed at the hotel bar.
With the reporter from Limoges.
You know, country landscapes...
what I like above all is watching people.
Are you in love now?
No.
When not in love, what do you do?
I do nothing.
No sex? Nothing at all?
Nothing.
That must be hard.
It can last... a long time.
I know.
Even when it's long,
you never allow yourself
something a little wild?
Making love is better
when you're in love.
But it's good to let yourself go,
then pick up the routine.
I don't let myself go.
It can do you good.
You're not in love,
you let yourself go,
you meet a waiter,
a scientific researcher,
a dentist, a puppeteer,
- or an artist!
- Right!
I'm going.
I'm taking the train at 7 am.
- Are you coming?
- Yes.
He dances well.
I'm sorry if I hurt you the last time.
I'm off.
Listen, I...
We tried... Anyway.
Well, it may not be the right time.
I have something to ask.
Can I have the keys?
I don't believe it.
I won't keep them.
And remember, you gave them to me.
I know that, François.
Why do you need them?
For someone else?
You found someone "natural"?
I hope he's a good guy-
I worry about Cécile.
Meaning?
She tells me things.
Really?
So in fact, I won't, no...
In fact, I think I'll keep the keys.
Doesn't my daughter live here?
- And I still own half of this apartment.
- Alright...
- Even more than half.
- Yeah, sure...
When Cécile comes over, she talks.
She says that you cry almost every night.
You cry and she sees you cry.
Is that healthy for a 10 year old?
Your life is not my business,
but what's not good for her
concerns me.
I'll keep the keys
for reassurance.
- Give them to me.
- I don't have them.
See that guy again?
We came back to Paris together.
- There you go.
- And?
I came back with him
and we're still together.
I'm jealous.
You live with him?
We met 3 weeks ago.
We don't live together.
But you're together?
Yes!
Sorry to ask,
but why did he fall in love with you?
No idea. It's not for me to say.
I understand that he fell in love.
It's the opposite I don't get.
- Why?
- Come now.
Sorry to ask,
do the two of you ever talk?
Yes.
A lot.
Does he understand
how our profession works?
I don't know...
What does it change?
Nothing.
Sorry, I agree with you.
So what do you talk about?
Lots of things.
Anyway, we talk.
Do you do things together?
See each other's friends?
No.
- Never?
- It hasn't happened yet.
We usually hang out at my place.
We take walks...
It won't last.
No couple can stay in a bubble
without a social environment.
Does he have friends?
Yes.
Why doesn't he introduce you?
I don't know.
Maybe he's afraid I won't be interested.
Maybe he wouldn't feel comfortable.
Or maybe they'd be uncomfortable.
Or he'd feel divided.
They're two different milieus.
Sometimes you're not comfortable.
I understand what you have to offer.
So explain.
Why do you say what I have to offer?
It's obvious. You offer a legitimacy
he'd never have had.
But besides his exoticism
and having some fun...
Sure, OK, that's great.
Have fun,
enjoy it in the meantime, but...
trust me, take some distance
or you'll suffer.
He'll never give you what you need.
Why not?
Trust me, you'll see.
Have fun, enjoy.
He never sees your friends?
We met only 3 weeks ago.
Who knows if either of us
will want it to last?
How does he get by? On welfare?
I don't know. I didn't ask.
Meet someone from your milieu
or it'll never work.
Same old story.
You'll just have your work to get by.
But...
You want more.
You're entitled to more.
You want to be happy, don't you?
Of course.
What's his name?
Sylvain.
Did you introduce your daughter to him?
Your own milieu, trust me.
- It can't work...
- I'm not happy with those people, Fabrice.
You figure me wrong.
OK, you want something new.
And it's normal that he's into you.
It's you I don't get.
Live it but don't believe in it too much.
How do you live something
with someone
without believing it?
Don't get involved.
Anyway, I wouldn't bet one cent
on that relationship.
Did he go to school? High school grad?
Yes he graduated high school.
You're incredible.
To love, I need to admire.
Sure, I could go fall in love
with a hair dresser
but I wouldn't live with her.
I could possibly sleep with her.
That's all.
Goodbye, thanks.
Nice parka. It suits you.
- Ciao!
- Ciao.
Sylvain, where are you?
I need to see you now.
I have things to tell you,
I have...
Specific questions
to ask about us, our commitment.
Why don't we see your friends together?
Why don't you ever come see mine?
Fabrice says your being with me
gives you a legitimacy.
He said to have fun with you,
but not to believe.
To meet someone from my "milieu".
He asked if we saw friends, I said no.
He said it wouldn't last.
So let's stop.
I don't want that.
So stop hurting me.
That's not nice.
He hurt you, so you hurt me.
How dumb of you.
How can a smart girl like you do that?
Truth is, you're like them.
- No. I'm not like them.
- You are!
No!
Yes, you are.
Stay with them.
I'll stay with my friends.
So you see?
He was right to tell me that.
What did you answer when he said that?
- Nothing.
- You said nothing.
No, I said nothing.
Too bad for you.
What could I say?
Maybe you could say,
"Stop badmouthing the man I love."
He said something awful.
- Don't say it.
- It's bad for him.
He said he could love a hair dresser...
Who is he? What does he do?
Listen... He has a gallery.
A gallery.
So he's smart.
He should understand.
Look how worked up it gets you.
Look at you.
Why stay with them?
Come to me, Isabelle.
Come to me.
I feel good with you.
Me too.
Really?
Of course.
But I didn't know if you...
I know, that's my problem.
No one knows what I think.
It's nice to hold your hand.
I'm glad you gave it to me.
This matters to me a lot.
I have to go.
Or I'll do something stupid.
Want to come over for 5 minutes?
It's close. 10 minutes. I'll make tea.
It's not a good idea.
I want to stop jumping into things.
So why did you kiss me?
I don't get it.
You took my hand.
So I kiss you.
- So it's to be polite.
- No.
How can you say that?
I won't rush things.
Stay with me.
Please.
Please, stay a little longer with me.
It's meaningless, otherwise.
I understand your reaction.
But if you give me an ultimatum,
I'll shut down.
Lockdown mode.
I'm taking my kids on vacation.
We'll meet in a month,
if you're still here.
I like what's happening between us.
You see the space
that goes from here to here.
I like it when you speak like this,
softly, into my ear.
I feel good.
I don't know what to say.
I'd like...
And at the same time, no.
I mean, not me...
Enough.
You're a good man, David.
What good does it do?
Yes, it's important.
- Goodbye.
- David!
We'll meet again?
I don't think so.
How could I have believed in it?
The only thing
you have to be careful about
is not to pick up
any emotional interference.
Because you're vulnerable
in that domain.
I also get the impression
you've recently undergone...
a period...
which was like being in limbo.
Not an easy time.
Repercussion-wise, however,
I think we're progressively
sweeping all of that away.
That's exactly how
I'd tend to see things now.
In another light,
I'd evoke manifestations
that are artistic,
creative, etc.
I like your synthetic mind.
The way you feel things,
see things,
analyse them deep within yourself.
We'll have to see how things play out.
Painting may have
a certain importance for you.
That's what I feel.
We'll have to explore that later.
To begin with, I'd like to know
if these elements speak to you,
on the whole.
For me, it's important.
I'd like them to.
In which case
I'll keep examining things in detail.
Now I'm supposed to react?
That's right.
To what I just heard.
Right?
- That's right.
- Yeah, that's right.
That's exactly it.
The most obvious thing,
to save you from...
You just mentioned painting...
I'm an artist. It's my life.
That's it.
So you got that right.
Sol...
Honestly, the question is...
It's my emotional relationships that...
...keep obsessing me.
Last year I met someone who really...
...who had an effect on me.
Here, I have some pictures.
- I shall see.
- And so...
There's another person
I want to bring up.
I have no pictures.
He just came into my life.
- It's not a problem.
- I'd like to know if...
So him...
He's the one
who came into my life last year.
All right.
- It must not have been easy...
- No.
Probably even a little...
...devastating.
Yes, but fulfilling, too.
But I don't know if it's over.
How old is the other person?
He's fifty, but I don't have a photo.
And nothing's happened with him.
I don't know...
You have to help
because I don't know.
This one will bounce back.
With a new mindset.
He may see things differently,
with newfound maturity.
It's the feeling I get.
He'll try to make contact again.
Problem is, he can be on the borderline.
He has to be careful
not to go off on something...
- I think he can bring fulfilment.
- Yes.
But you have to be careful
with his mood swings.
Because that's...
that's the impression I get.
Because it can make him...
Go off.
He goes off easily.
It's true that...
You're going to see him again.
Really?
You'll see him again.
You'll have news of him.
He'll resurface.
He'll shine in his profession.
He'll do something that's not bad.
You'll have news of him.
He'll want to see you again.
That day, I suggest
you don't close the door on him.
See what he has to say.
How he behaves.
Pardon the expression but...
Will he try to "reset the table"?
I'd say... yes, he will.
But is he the perfect person for you?
No.
Is he your future,
with whom you'll walk down
the great road of life?
No, I don't think so.
Something else is coming.
It will be a lot meatier,
weightier.
Sturdier, too.
That's what I feel.
I'll tell you about the other person.
You'll see the one in the picture again.
There will be others, I'm telling you.
- Oh, yes!
- Others?
Other people
who show up on your doorstep.
I wonder if you're going to meet someone
who's an actor or in that domain.
You'll see.
You attract people like that.
People like that?
Yes, yes.
That's fine.
Actors, stuff like that.
There's one you'll re-attract.
I think he has dark hair, to start with.
And it's something that will also be...
Fusional.
Less unbalanced than this one.
This is a bit disjointed. It's not easy.
At some point,
you may be fed up with the disjointedness.
That's why I say something new is coming,
to help you understand that deep down,
your future is perhaps
more in that direction than with him.
Yes, so...
Even if I have a future elsewhere,
with someone else,
I don't lose him entirely, do I?
He's not easy.
He won't accept being just a friend,
unless it evolves into something else.
Just see how it goes.
So the other one...
The other one is 50?
Yes, and no photo.
Want to know his name? Marc.
Carry on.
He works in a museum. I met him in...
in a professional context.
Yeah, and I...
That's what I was saying.
You need people out of the ordinary.
There may also be...
someone who's a bit of
an adventurer...
...who comes into your life.
Or a messenger.
Someone who experiences things
with his faith.
Someone authentic.
You need someone authentic.
From what I see,
you need something authentic.
It can be the one from the museum.
This one is pretty brilliant.
In what I'm channelling...
...without abusing it,
he can use it.
Without abusing it, he uses it.
Meaning?
I mean, his brilliant side.
He can use it.
He's an important man.
He represents something.
But watch out...
Watch out, because I think this man...
is in a period of transition
emotionally, as well.
You're there...
but you can't be a woman who is used
like a transitionalist element,
to help him cross to the other bank.
You must be careful of that.
How?
You mustn't be used by him.
Because“.
I get the impression he's a man
who can have whims.
Attractive whims.
Tics, yes tics.
So you, you fall in love...
OK, all right,
but what do I do after?
That's all fine,
but I don't want to be used.
I'm not just an individual
used as a crutch, or a cane,
to help people cross
from one bank to another.
It's not possible.
Because, pardon the expression...
you mustn't come out of it
bruised and battered.
Because he feasts on you...
feeling good, etc.
And then, pardon the expression,
I finished feasting, and now what?
- So for example, the one who's 50...
- Go on.
I don't think
he's the love of your life.
Yes, I doubt it.
I think...
the love of your life is someone else.
So as of now, you're not shielded.
Which is better.
You're still going to be
in a position to meet other people.
Who will reveal themselves.
Be... "open".
But...
AFB/Way, he's going to...
I won't lose him. He'll be back.
Yes, which doesn't mean
nothing will happen before.
He'll come back...
And you have this 50-year-old man
waving hello.
Let them come. "Open".
Don't get yourself all in a stew.
It serves no purpose whatsoever.
Live what you have to live.
Take care of yourself,
don't fall into traps.
That's all I ask of you.
Because the 50 year old is...
He's a trap.
Because he's a mirage.
You can show me another picture
once he resurfaces.
We'll waste no time,
kill two birds with one stone.
I'm persuaded I'm right
about this 50 year old.
I see you with people better than him,
with more charisma, more depth,
more...
You'll have plenty of that.
You'll see, my actor will reappear.
If I were you,
I wouldn't torture myself.
Take care of what is
essential for you.
It's you that matters.
Me, my work,
and I take care of my business.
I let things happen.
I don't take care of the rest.
I try to find a beautiful sun within.
That's all I ask of you.
All right, so...
the idea is that I come back here
once...
once the other one comes back.
Is that it?
And you,
in the meantime, you're "open".
Open.
That's all I ask of you.
Open.
