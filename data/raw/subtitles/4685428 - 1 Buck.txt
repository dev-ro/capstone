Good.
I gotta get closer.
Oh, shit.

since this shit started.
All right, I'm done.

Headquarters, we're gonna need
a dive team at our location.
Copy that?
Captain Lopez, is there any information
that you could share with us?
The body of woman has been found
and removed from the water.
Should our citizens be
concerned at this time?
Do we need a neighborhood watch,
a curfew, or should the FBI be involved?
We are doing our job.
As you've just heard, a female body
has been found in black bayou.
We will give you more updates
on this scene as soon as it arrives.

Yeah, son, good to see you too.
Mom, I need five dollars for tomorrow.

Sweetie, god has nothing to do with money.

Headquarters to 601.
Headquarters to 601.
This is 601. Go ahead.
601, be en route to 1618 market street,
coyote's bar and grill,
in reference to an investigation.
Contact your callers, a white female and
a black female in front of the bar.
Callers state that they are
going to have information
regarding the homicide of Debbie teague.
You better be here looking for Debbie.
You don't look a kind of cop
to give us working girls a hard time.
Fair enough.
Let me make it up to you.
You girls work on commission, right?
That's right.
I'll get us some drinks, anything you want.
I'd like a whisky.
Thank you.
Sit down?
What can you tell me about Ms. hassell?
Debbie?
She was a good girl.
Why you say "was?"
You hear about all
these girls going missing,
but don't ever hear about
anybody finding them.
Yeah, we're working on that.
We know how dangerous it is out there.
Even without the serial killers.
We always tell each other where we're going.
All right, so when the
last time you saw her?
Last night,
around 11.
She left with some guy.
Did you get a look at him?
No, not really.
And you wonder why we have
trouble catching the guy.
You know if she has any regular hang
outs, friends she might be with?
I said we looked out for one another.
Didn't say nothing about being best friends.
So what kind of cop do I look like?
You don't look like a cop.
You look like trouble.
That's all right though.
I like bad boys.
. Woo!
You look a little drowsy, honey.
I say you and me step outside
for a breath of fresh air.
It'll cost you 50.
Me and my buddy, here,
we like to shoot at the same hole.
Got that right.
Oh, show me how you like it, big boy.
Deeper!
I'll take care of both y'all real fine.
But it'll cost your double
for double the trouble.
It ain't gonna be no trouble.
Just double.
Fuck me, cowboy, come on!
Come on, cowboy.
There's gonna be three of us now.
I'm gonna be...
Oh my god, how long?
Oh, I'm so happy-
I'm glad you're happy.
Oh, I'm so happy.
I love you, Harry.
I love you girls too.
What the fuck?
Are you serious?
I was just about to come.
Oh, you fucking loser.
God, fuck, damn it.
Where's the cop?
Mean the loser?
He's still in the bathroom.
Damn.
You up for some fun tonight, babe?
Sorry, boys.
The sign says closed.
What we waiting for?
Let's roll.
So this is your love nest?
That's right.

I'm so impressed.

What time is it?
I haven't got paid yet.
Bullshit.

Hello?
A friend said i could call you in case.
In case of what?
Just in case.
I'm really tired.
I'm not in the mood.
Anyway, I needed a
little help with something.

Fucking asshole.

Wow.
I am proud of you. That is great.
That is amazing.
Hey, Jeremy.
How are you?
Good.
God, you're getting so tall.
You're getting shorter, I think.
Hi, how's it going?
It's fine.
So good to see you.
Me too.
That's my seat.
Okay, I guess I'll just go to my room.
You work hard, you need your rest.
He's such a sweetheart.
Yes.
Goodness.
Hey, someone's here.
What the hell is this?
Ain't serious, are you?
I didn't have a choice, Thomas.
So you're dragging me in front of a judge
like some fucking criminal?
You owe me money.
What do you want me to do?
I'm trying to get myself together here.
I don't believe you anymore.
All you been doing is lying to me
for the last couple of months.
Spending all our money on poker.
Where you going?
Like I'm done with you, bitch?
What you think you gonna get away with this?
Hey, Harry, are you free right now?
Yeah, I'm over at Sam's house
and Thomas just got here
and he's raging angry.
Can you please come over?
Loser.
Hey!
Get out of here.
I just called the cops.
Good for you.
You ain't seeing a fucking
dime from me, how bout that?
Why don't you go back to sucking dick?
Fuck you.
He's such a fucking asshole.
Sam?
Sam?
You all right?
Look, I see this all the time.
If you don't do something,
it never ends good.
It'll be fine.
Thank you.
Can I get you something?
A drink?
No, I'm good.
L gotta go-
can I drop you somewhere?
Yeah, home.
You call me anytime.
When you gonna pitch a tent?
Mom.
What?
I'm old, not dead.
Need have a man around the house.
I love you.
Hey, did you hear what the town's
doing to the school kids?
Making them wear the same uniforms.
Oh, I know.
You know what, I think it's a good idea.
Who knows, they might
even study a little more.
You know what, i gotta get going.
My mom's at home.
All right, see you, Sam.
' See you.
Honestly, Jay, I'm just so sick and tired
of sneaking around like this.
It's been two years now.
I mean, how much more time do you need?
I just need a little more time.
Listen, your brother's not
in a good place right now.
L just have to be careful with him.
I understand that my brother
is not doing well right now,
but what does that have to do
with us and our relationship?
Amara, your brother is addicted to drugs.
Prostitutes, gambling, everything.
The feds are on to him.
They're probably out there
following him right now.
I don't think I can protect him anymore.
How long did you know about this?
Why didn't you say anything to me about this?
I mean, he's my brother.
I need to do something about this, okay?
I know. I know.
I can't just let...
I can't just watch him fall apart like this.
Listen, I just need you to be prepared
if shit hits the fan.
Okay?
Look, let's just hope for the best,
but we need to prepare for the worst.
I love you.
You know that, right?
Yeah.
I'll do the best for us.
Okay?
Come here.
I think the pizza's here.
Go pay for it.
Hi.
$9.75, ma'am.
How did you get here?
Oh, I'm just two blocks away.
It's not a big deal.
You know what, here you go.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
All right, have a good night.
Where you been at?
Don't take no hour to do one delivery.
Huh?
Been out getting some air, Jordan?
You do that ghetto shit on your time, okay?
Your job is simple.
I give you food and you give me money.
Simple shit, boy.
So you think it's ghetto
that I just did 27 deliveries today?
You know, yesterday i was this close
to doubling that amount?
But I guess that shit's ghetto two, right?
You want a fucking medal?
Yeah, I do.
You know how much this place costs me?
Now I gotta do twice as much work,
doing damage control on
everything you fuck up.
I'm supposed to clean up after your shit?
I don't think so.
Fuck that shit, man.
L quit!
Now you can cleanup after my shit.
. Okay-
Obama's America.
Yeah.
See,
y'all don't wanna work.
Now pick that up and do your job!
This ain't slavery days, man.
And you don't pay me enough to put up
with your racist, redneck bullshit.
So you can kiss my motherfucking black ass.
I ain't kissing your black nothing.
You just a lazy ass nigger.
He hit me!
You piece of shit nigger.
I'm calling the cops.
What the fuck you say to me, white boy?
Call the cops.
You better run.
Give me my money.
Oh, you want your money?
Huh?
This little lousy ass fucking chump change?
Here!
Take that fucking money.
Shove it up the pasty white ass of yours.
Bitch!
Yo, that nigger hit me.
See those hands!
See your hands! Hands up!
Keep them up!
Okay, okay! Just don't shoot.
Turn around and get against the wall!
Okay, okay!
Put your hands on the wall.
Just please, don't shoot me.
You have any guns on you?
Please, can you tell me what this is about?
Why?
Stop resisting.
Stop resisting. Don't you resist.
Stand up.
In route to the jail.
Detective magio.
Be advised,
suspect Jordan Cox,
booked on battery charges.
Matches prints from two
of your recent homicides.
Be advised.
Suspect Jordan Cox is known
to have had a relationship
with recent homicide victim, Maria Cooper.
Look at these pictures.
You recognize those girls?
I don't know them people.
Maybe you oughta take another look.
I just looked at it.
Like I told you before, I don't know.
You're the prime suspect.
Really?
Yeah.
We know you did it.
What I wanna know is why.
Why what?
Why did you kill these girls?
I didn't kill nobody, man!
Look, I swear to god...
don't you swear.
Oh, okay.
I promise to god.
Let me help you out.
Oh, you wanna help me out again.
Yeah, I'll help you out.
What you got for me this time?
You go over to her house
because you wanna fuck her.
You ring the doorbell.
She answers and she says no.
Who knows why.
Maybe you do.
She says no.
You get mad, lose your temper.
Next thing you know, she's dead.
What do you want me to say?
I don't even know what you're talking about!
God damn.
We know you were fucking
at least one of these girls.
And the sooner you admit it
sign a confession!
You admit you did it.
We'll be able to plea bargain.
We can help you out.
Now you keep this shit up,
get dragged in front of a jury for murder,
they will chew you up and
spit your black ass out.
You'll be lucky to get life.
Like I told you before,
I didn't have shit to do with these
white women getting killed.
How many goddamn ways i can tell you that?
Seriously?
The only suspect you can
find was my black ass,
because of a fingerprint?
Give me a break, man.
Harry.
You need to think about your attitude.
What the hell is going on with you?
What?
This.
I got an admitted violent offender
with prints all over my case.
Really? Prints? Prints?
He's a fucking delivery boy.
His prints are on every doorknob.
You know, I can't deal with you anymore.
Lam so tired of picking up
your reckless detective work.
Picking up the pieces.
You're a mess out there.
I'm just so done with you, Harry.
You need to take some time off.
Fuck you.
You're free to go.
Harry, take time off.
Go.
You don't tell me what to do.
Harry.
Stay the fuck out of my business.
Come with me and get your stuff.
Hey, come here.
Come on.
Sorry.
Listen.
I know we said some shitty things before,
but we're always gonna love each other,
right?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Sign here.
I get harassed and now i
gotta sign for my own stuff?
I got him.
Sorry about the mix up.
Now you have a problem.
Don't change the fucking topic, Andreas.
You gonna do what I asked
you to do or what, man?
Get the fuck out of here.
Look dude.
I don't think you fucking understand, my man.
If I don't get what I want,
I'm gonna fucking smoke you.
I know he's cruising the streets right now,
looking for his next victim.
Finally decided to...
Hey.
Good evening, ma'am.
I'm in charge of maintenance around here.
Seems there might be a
plumbing problem in your room.
Water's leaking in next door
and we think it might be
coming from your bathroom.
I know you're
doing business on Facebook, bro.
I'm not fucking stupid. Okay?
You mind if I take a look?
I haven't heard anything or seen any water.
Maybe somebody came by already and fixed it.
They would've told me.
Seeing as I only live a few miles from here.
You work around these parts?
Yeah.
I work at the mini-mart in town.
I'm a cashier.
Nice to meet you.
My name's bill.
And you?
I'm Janet.
Can this wait 'til tomorrow?
My ex is supposed to be coming by any minute.
I think it's best if I take a look.
. Okay-
come on in.
You could just make it quick.
Where do you think it might be leaking?
Good morning?
Morning.
Don't shoot!
You want me to come back later?
Just give me a minute.
All right.
Hey, don't you owe me some money?
A man of my word.
Now I know that's not payment in full,
but hopefully that'll do
until I can get a job.
This is it?
This is all you can give me?
That's all I got right now.
Yes, I'm calling about the ad.
Yes, Jordan.
Address please?
Thank you. Thank you.
Oh my god!
Oh my god, help!
Help!
Oh my god! Oh my god!
Somebody call the police.
There's blood everywhere!
911, what's your emergency?
Get the police here!
My maid saw a lot of
blood in one of the rooms.
Yes, ma'am.
Send them quickly.
Ma'am, can you give me your address?
Town and country motel,
on Texas street.
Headquarters to detective magio
and all units in the area of
the town and country motel.
Units, be in route to the
town and country hotel
in reference to a 911 call.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
My cleaning lady saw a lot of blood.
It's in room 124.
We'll take a look.
Tape it off, guys.
This god damn nigger stole
five grand from me, man.
I know exactly where he keeps it.
You kill his black ass,
you keep that five grand.
Now you make me work twice
my own motherfucking money.
Alright, fine.
L'mma do this.
But let's set an example
what happens the next time
you don't have my motherfucking money.
Yo, here he comes, man.
Kick his ass.
Kick his ass.
Excuse me. Hey.
Hey partner, you got a light?
As long as you promise
not to run off with it.
Oh man, it's your lighter.
Thank you. Thank you, really.
You usually run off with people's money?
Do I know you?
It don't matter, man.
Son of a bitch.
Are you okay, sweetie?
What?
Do you need me to get
you something to drink?
No, I'm good. Thanks.
So did you hear anything?
See anything?
No, nothing.
The first thing we heard
was when the maid screamed.
. Okay'
I'm going need a complete
list of all your guests.
Names, contact information.
All of them?
All of them.
Everybody?
Please, get it printed out
and give it to the one
officer that will be here.
Tell him I asked for it.
Now if you think anything
else, call me all right?
Okay. Thank you.
Ma'am, could you spare few dollars?
Kind of hungry you know?
Appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
Ls there any other characteristics
that you can expand on that you have found
that is common amongst serial killers?
Can you give us any picture
of what this guy looks like?
What he's thinking?
A lot of times you might think he's
some scruffy looking character.
He doesn't rob them, so it's not the money.
Money is not the object of this thing
and really it's just the way
that he gets his jollies.
What's up, man?
You got some stuff?
All right, cool.
We won't be long.
This car is badass.
I got to tell you, detective,
I've been a real bad girl.
I'll give you a ride home.
I don't want to go home, Harry.
I want to talk.
Talk about what?
About us. You and me.
Sit down.
Still nothing to say?
Dammit, I need more, Harry.
You want to be with me or you don't?
Where you going?
What the fuck do you care, Harry?
Come on, you can't walk out from here.
Get the fuck off me.
What are you doing?
Christ, look where you are.
You won't make it three blocks.
Fuck you, Harry.
I'll give you a ride.
Let me go! Let me go!
I'm gonna give you a ride home.
Harry, put me down.
Fucking asshole.
Put me down!
Fuck! Put me down!
Put me down.
Oh, shit.
What is you doing?
Sorry man, that's my bad.
You all right?
Yeah.
You got a buck in there?
What do I owe you?
Just give me, like, four bucks.
Here's five.
Thanks, man.
Stay out of trouble, all right?
All right.
Damn, he tried to kill me, man.
Can I get a whisky?
There you go.
Thanks.
You girls be careful out there.
We'll be fine, daddy.
I love you.
Love you too.
Allison?
Babe?
Allison!
Attention all units,
this is detective maggio.
You know what Harry? I am done.
Hell, everyone is done with you.
You know what? I shouldn't even tell you this
but the FBI has been investigating you.
And I am glad because for the past two years
everyone that loves you has been watching you
fuck your life up!
So go ahead,
drink up, party away!
Have fun.
You think I'm having fun?!
In the last year,
I've seen eleven murdered women.
Eleven women I didn't save,
just like I didn't save Allison.
Harry.
And every time I see one.
I see Allison.
And poof!
She's gone.
She's everywhere. She's nowhere.
Harry.

Are you 1092?
Shit.
Bossier city police are reporting
the capture of long sought after bayou killer
believed responsible for as
many as 11 grizzly murders
in the last year.
The suspected serial
killer has been identified
as bill Cain, the 37 years
old owner of Cain's garage
in bossier city.
Little was known about the suspect other than
he was an only child who
grew up in bossier city
and inherited the garage from his father.
The suspect was identified
by the lead investigator
in the case, detective Harry maggio,
who suffered a severe head injury
during the dramatic rescue
of a potential 12th victim
at Cain's garage.
We are happy to say that he
is expected to fully recover
with no lasting effects from the injury.
However, sources tell us
an internal investigation
has been launched involving detective maggio.
While we don't know the
specifics of this investigation,
rumors state that the investigation may
of serious misconduct,
including narcotics and prostitution.
We have also been informed that due to
the serious nature of this investigation,
the bossier city police have involved the FBI
in their investigation of detective maggio.
