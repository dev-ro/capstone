NETFLIX PRESENTS
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM
BASED ON A TRUE STORY
Sorena!
-You're leaving now?
-Yes, it's time.
Look after the kids, right?
Don't let mum do it all by herself.
Can I have your room while you're away?
-OK, but don't mess it up.
-It's already a mess.
You say you're going
to walk in the mountains,
but it's more like the mountain's
walking all over you!
It's nothing mum,
it's a question of habit.
I put a novel in your bag.
You have to read it!
I chose it because it ends well.
Here.
Take this as well.
I can't take sweets with me!
Since when do you talk back to me?
Goodbye, mummy.
Come on, give me the bag.
Go on.
Samy, we're going to be late, my boy.

BASED ON THE NOVEL BY
Don't you want me to wait for you?
It's OK, I'll find someone to drop me off.
Samy.
Try to go all the way this time.
It's six o'clock on Radio Nomad
and welcome to Seine-Saint-Denis,
where all the kings of France are buried
along with the dreams of a bunch of kids
from round here.
We have an exceptional guest
this morning, Max!
Yes, Samy, soon to be the furthest out
black guy on the planet is with us!
He'll be the first guy from the estate
to climb the Himalayas.
The Himalayas in Nepal,
nothing to do with the hookah bar!
-Hi, Samy!
-Hi.
Closer to the mic, buddy.
So you're going from the highest block
in the neighborhood
to the world's highest mountain?
You could have started with block C!
It does seem a bit extreme,
but I've been training.
He's been walking up
15 flights of stairs for 26 years
because the lift is broken!
I've been taking the stairs for a while,
I can feel it in my legs.
You know mount Everest is 29,029 ft tall,
which makes a 2,528-floor building!
How's that for stairs?
Jokes aside!
That kind of trip costs a load, right?
Mittens, your three-ton bag,
is one of your cousins in there?
How did you manage?
-Parents? Friends?
-Selling dope?
No way.
No, I'm from a modest family, no secret.
I tried banks.
Banks?
BANK CREDIT AND INSURANCE
A Senegalese asking
to go to the mountains,
they thought it was a prank.
How did you manage?
I went to see a sponsor who understood me.
How much?
All together? 40 000?
Thirty-eight?
I want to see my logo
all over your clothes, even your pants.
Given the weather up there,
I won't be in my pants much.
And it seems you apparently have
another sponsor?
Yeah, you, Radio Nomad.
We're taking you
to the rooftop of the world.
We've given Samy
an unlimited mobile package
so he can call us to share his adventure.
So Samy, what do you say?
Thank you, Radio Nomad!
Oh, he's happy!
I'd like to ask you the question
everyone's asking themselves.
Why are you doing this?
People often say we're good for nothing.
For once I want to be good for something.
That's beautiful. Sounds like a pop song.
Isn't there something else?
I'm doing it for myself,
my family, my neighborhood,
and for someone I care about.
-So there's a girl!
-Max!
Can we have her name?
Nadia.
You were supposed to pick me up.
There was a problem with the car.
Shall we kiss cheeks?
-How are you?
-Good, and you?
Are you taking me to Fouquet's?
No, I'm joking.
Anything but McDonald's.
That would be crazy!
Making me take the metro's crazy.
-The car...
-Come on, you can tell me over food.
Wait, you know...
The guy's been trying
to pick her up every day for six months.
Then Samira ends up asking
"haven't you noticed anything?"
and what does he answer?
"Did you cut your hair?," he says.
Her hair is like silk, see.
She answers "no,"
she puts her hands on her boobs,
moves them around and says
"I got a boob job, mate,
look well because it's the last time
you're seeing them."
-Can you imagine?
-That's full on.
She left him standing there.
The guy's been crying for three weeks,
she hasn't given in.
-The bastard.
-No, she hasn't given in for three weeks.
-That's good.
-Oh, three weeks!
We're proud of her.
There's something I don't get.
Is she into this guy?
Of course she is!
Yeah.
OK, so...
Good night.
What are you doing?
Cut it out, what are you doing?
Thought you were gonna get me
with a steak?
-That's hard.
-You're the one who seems hard!
-You on heat or what?
-I've liked you for years.
Say yes or no, but say something!
Shit, Samy, I take guys seriously,
I don't go out with just anybody!
Do you wear nice lipstick and dress up
to go for dinner with just anybody?
By the way, you're beautiful tonight.
We tried before, it didn't work out.
We were thirteen! In year nine.
Exactly! What have you done since then?
I want reliability.
I go down the job center
every day looking for work!
Under twenty-fives have a hard time here.
Half of us are on the dole.
-You're twenty-six.
-Yeah, maybe...
But I'm not a bad apple.
If I had a bird,
I mean, a partner,
it'd well motivate me
to get out of trouble.
I need someone I can lean on,
not the other way round.
But I'd do anything for you.
-I'd climb Mt. Everest if I had to!
-Would you?
Whatever. You don't even know
how high Everest is.
Of course, I do.
We learned that in school,
you weren't ever there.
Why do you think you repeated year nine?
You're such a stunner,
how could I concentrate?
Come on, stop it, you got me.
How tall is it?
Well... Everest is the highest.
Yes, it is.
But that doesn't tell me how high.
Give or take 500 ft, ice melts, you know.
-Give or take 5,000 feet.
-I don't know,
you've completely thrown me!
It's 29,029 feet.
It could be higher, I'd climb it for you!
Well, start by finding a job.
You're right.
You need proof?
To know you can count on your man?
Well, I'll climb Mt. bloody Everest!
I'll climb it for you,
you'll see I'm no loser and that I care.
Oh, yeah?
-You'd do that for me?
-Yeah, for you!
I can even give you children!
Climb Everest first,
then we'll see about children.
Deal?
Deal.
A kiss of encouragement before I go?
I'm not that kissy-kissy.
I'd rather have a proper snog
when you get back.
If you leave.
ALT. 95 FT
Stupid deal.
Good luck Samy
and don't forget to call Radio Nomad!
Radio Nomad, with Ben and Max!
-Hey, what's up?
-What's up, guys?
You get kicked out or what?
No, he's gonna climb mountains
and that kind of shit's hot man!
-A month's walk.
-How come?
I feel like changing a bit.
Damn, bro'.
The only idea you've had all year
is I'm gonna walk for a month.
-Drop me off at the station, OK?
-Get in!
Get in the other side!
Get in the other side, bro'!
You look like Iron Man with that bag!
What you're doing's great
for our reputation.
They'll see we're not a bunch of slackers.
-Thanks.
-I respect you.
Here, my pleasure, take it, it's a gift!
Smoking spliffs
at that altitude isn't advised.
Seriously?
This guy's nuts!
What the hell do you care,
it's like traveler's cheques,
trade it any time!
-See you, guys.
-Send us pics.
Watch out, mate.
KATHMANDU - ALT. 4,593 FT
Peter will take care of you upon arrival.
Peter's our on-site agent.
Peter...
-Welcome to Nepal!
-Thank you.
-Are you Peter?
-Yes.
-Is Peter your real name?
-No.
I'm Kovinajpül-Katchpü, if you prefer.
Peter! Let's stick to Peter! Peter's good.
They were talking about you on the radio!
Whatever.
I heard Samy
saying he was going to a mountain
and that he went because of you.
But it's not because of me!
He wants to climb Mt. Everest
to get me to go out with him.
No way!
That's so cool!
Where is it already, India?
In Nepal and China.
Can't see what's so cool.
I live on the sixth floor with no lift
and not one guy
would come up for me, honest!
But it's just talk to pick me up.
Between what he says and what he does...
-No, I'd be surprised.
-I'm telling you.
-He's already left.
-Really?
Youssef's brother dropped him off
at the station.
By this time he's probably there already.
Cut it out, you're kidding?
The radio's paying
for him to call every day
to tell us how it's going.
So did he really go for you?
That's what he said but...
It's still stupid going like that,
on an impulse, right?
Do you know many guys
who'd do that for you?
Kathmandu!
Hotel, is over there, on left.
So we'll...?
Are the five stars
included in the package?
Actually,
my sister lives in La Courneuve,
so I got you a special offer.
That's kind.
"My sister lives in La Courneuve."
So for those who like water,
it's going to rain from North to South.
We're expecting
up to two inches of rain...
Thanks for the crap news.
Mine's better seeing
as Samy's on the line,
calling us live from Kathmandu.
-Hello Samy, can you hear me?
-Yes, I hear you.
So you arrived in Kathmandu
a few hours ago, right?
Exactly.
Well, tell us! Thousands of people
are listening now!
Well, it's a bit of a small town,
there are temples everywhere.
People are really nice.
-They say  namaste  all the time.
- Namaste ?
Namaste  means hello in Nepalese!
OK guys, get this,
our first Nepalese lesson live!
What's it like?
Does it smell of piss, like here? Tell us!
It's pretty calm here; not even one cop.
Talking of which we have
a question from our sound tech:
how's the weed in Nepal?
No time for fun,
I still have stuff to buy,
papers to fill out, so I have to go now.
What about tomorrow?
Tomorrow I'm catching a plane to Lukla.
It's at 10,000 ft.
The highest airport in the country.
And the most dangerous
apparently.
Oh, maybe.
Then I'll have to walk.
Of course, they won't just put you
on top of the peak!
OK, so good luck Samy,
and send us some photos.
-Thanks.
-6:15, Radio Nomad...
There's the job done!
Put the phone number here.
Person to warn in case of an accident,
to repatriate the body, OK?
Are there often accidents
in the mountains?
Much more than on the roads. Know why?
No.
Because there are no roads!
Thank you, thank you.
Have a good trip, bye!
They're all over the place! This is nuts!
-26,089 ft.
-Yes, impressive.
That one there: Pumori,
23,491 feet.
He disagrees.
Lhotse, 27,940 feet.
Yes, Lhotse? Lhotse.
I wanted to do that one and then...
-Difficult.
-And that one, at the back?
The one that, um?
Louis de Funès!
ALT. 9,396 FT
I need to practice.
You win, Johnny.
But don't try messing with me!
I'm from La Courneuve, OK?
How much to carry the bag up?
No, wait Johnny!
Tell me how much first!
Bring my damn bag back here!
Namaste too.
Beautiful.
Are you Jeff?
Samy Diakhaté. Nice to meet you.
I was sure it was you...
From what I heard about you.
Jeff is a professional, nice, warm.
So you climbed Mt. Blanc?
Mt. Blanc is still badass.
Akim did it with his sister
on a field trip.
Really?
-Were you roped up?
-Frankly?
No need, it was cool.
A health walk.
-Studs?
-No studs, no ropes.
All in the head!
And the weather was nice too.
Kilimanjaro.
It's full of crocodiles.
Fat chance he's been there.
-By the North face?
-A bit of each face.
Going to Kilimanjaro
gave me a taste for climbing.
I was... Especially the legs.
Empty your bag.
Your bag. Empty it.
Out here?
Yes.
Those are my trousers.
Smecta, you need that if your tummy hurts.
For night time.
Have you read this?
No need to say more.
My mum gave me these.
She said they were good
for sugar, sport and all.
Do you want one?
You're missing gear.
I'll write you another list.
You'll buy it in Namche.
We leave at 7:30 tomorrow.
-Any questions?
-No, everything's great.
I can't wait to get...
walking.
Greetings.
Hey, Johnny!
Does this pit-bull ever smile?
Here it is.
Put it there please. Thanks.
Not bad. Yeah, put it over there,
I'll put it away later.
Sit down.
Thank you.
How much this is going to cost?
We'll sort something out.
But I don't have much left.
And you heard him.
I need equipment and I'm not rich.
OK, we'll sort it out.
We'll sort it out... Say,
do you have cousins in Morocco?
Where's Morocco?
Forget about it.
Why are you smiling like that?
What?
My skin color?
You never saw a black guy?
-Seriously?
-Can I touch?
Yes.
See, it's a bit like you.
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.
"Jonathan didn't understand
why Clara had decided
never to see him again.
Their relationship had lasted for years
and even though
it hadn't always been rose-tinted..."
What's up with this story?
Impossible Love .
Impossible to read.

LIVE FROM NEPAL
That idiot really did it!
Anyway, it's not over yet.
I'm ready!
I'm ready!
Shit.
Thank you.
Have they left?
I'll have Corn Flakes.
Most of the accidents that happen up there
are often due to lack of vigilance.
So we're a group,
we stay united,
and everything will be fine.
That's clear.
My job is to get you up there,
but especially to get you all back
safe and sound.
I'd also like to congratulate Emmerich
for this year's K2 climb.
Welcome to Samy, back from Kilimanjaro.
So, time for Everest?
What are you looking for?
Johnny.
He has my bag!
Your bag left over 20 minutes ago.
Seriously?
The Sherpas always leave first.
Without a bag
it's going to be a health walk!
We'll see about that in a few days.
You know that in 1953,
the first man to climb Mt. Everest
was Sir Edmund Hilary.
They went from Kathmandu to Lukla on foot.
A month's hiking to get here.
Oh shit! Lucky.
Not him. Us.
Lucky they invented airplanes since!
Then again, maybe there'll be
a chairlift to the top in 50 years!
Alright. I'm just kidding.
Are we never going to stop?
I'm taking a break, I can't take any more.
I didn't sleep well, my legs weigh a ton.
We're running,
we're not even taking in the view!
It's beautiful, isn't it?
No, I feel better.
Let's go.
Didn't they learn
to make stone bridges or what?
It's not too soon.
What a nightmare.
Bloody hell.
Thank you, you're a brother.
Thank you.
Cool.
Lucky you're here.
Bloody hell, what are they on?
No way! A fridge, guys?!
No, not now. Not the right time, dammit.
Sophie, from Radio Nomad.
You're on air in one minute.
OK.
Hi everyone, it's 7:10
and you're live on Radio Nomad,
we're about to welcome
our main man Samy...
Your brother's on the radio!
... from Seine-Saint-Denis
to the Himalayas!
Samy boy! Can you hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you.
Hi there! Your fan base
is growing here, you know?
Really? Thanks, that's nice.
So tell us. Where are you now?
We've just stopped in a village
called Phadking.
Hard to pronounce.
There are about ten stone houses,
not more.
OK, cool.
Are you by yourself, with a group,
have you made any buddies?
Have you got it on?
There aren't many of us,
different nationalities,
we don't all have the same level.
Tell us our champion is one of the best!
These guys are good.
The Australians look like the All Blacks.
Not the right team, but no worries.
Give me two days and I'll show them up!
-I'll be a real Sherpa.
-That's my boy!
Scorching!
It's not a 300-feet sprint either.
And as my dad says,
slow and steady wins the race.
You're gonna make me cry,
but your dad didn't invent that phrase.
Sorry, I've got to go, we're off already.
-Good luck, we'll speak tomorrow.
-Thanks, bye.
Come on, guys!
Come on kids, get ready for school.
Breathe, lengthen your step.
Don't slump on your hips, stay straight,
get vertical.
That was ultra boring.
He lets out three words a minute,
no rhythm, no jokes.
It's dire!
No comeback, nothing.
The phone lines are busy.
Kids are calling in from everywhere.
Really?
I don't get it, why?
Well, he's climbing Mt. Everest
for some girl's love.
Still, 10,000 ft.
-How high does he want to go?
-29,029 ft.
Wasn't there an easier way
to get rid of him?
I didn't want that,
it was just a conversation.
Well, now the whole neighborhood knows.
How could I guess he'd go on the radio?
-Are you into him or not?
-Well...
He's alright.
You're into him.
It's no biggie, you can tell me!
Wait three weeks and you'll see.
I don't just want a fling,
I want to get it right.
They're all dicks anyway.
Gotta go.
Hey honey, it's me.
-Where's your brother?
-At football.
-And what are you up to?
-Revising.
Good girl.
Tell me, have you heard
from your friend Samy?
Who?
Samy Diakhaté,
your childhood friend
who's in the Himalayas.
Don't take me for a fool,
everybody's listening to the radio.
I haven't heard anything.
I don't know if he's really doing it
for you, but he's brave.
I like him.
Where are you going?
I'm going to get some equipment.
And my bag?
Samy, concentrate on your feet!
Let it pass, this one looks stubborn.
-But how can you tell?
-The eyes.
-Yellow eyes mean stubborn?
-No. It happens because of their diet.
Back home, it's red eyes.
Red?
Because of the weed.
Oh, damn.
So  donyeba  means thank you?
I don't know about  donyeba ,
but  dhanybhad  means thank you.
The gear they had back then is a joke.
They look like the chimney sweeps
from Mary Poppins.
That's harsh.
They make me sick, seriously!
They carry stuff like that all day?
Yes.
You should eat your sandwiches up.
No, really, I'm good.
Just a bit of tea.
Namas-tea.
The bastard! Jeff!

Namche.
Thank you, Johnny.
You've got them all.
Do you even know who he is?
Johnny Hallyday.
"Johnny Lallyday."
Do you know his songs?
-How about the t-shirt?
-A French guy.
He stayed here.
He became a monk.
No shit?
-He gave me all his t-shirts.
-And gave everything up?
And this? What's the story?
You won't like it, honest. Let it go.
Love story?
Yes, but you see,
it says  Impossible Amour .
Can you read it to me?
OK, I'll read it to you.
But first, we have to buy some kit.
Jeff gave me his list and you know he's...
"Johnny Lallyday."
We'll sort it out.
We'll sort it out,
but don't forget I'm paying.
You're a laugh,
the poles already cost me a lot.
You're shopping too!
-Studs.
-Yes, studs.
No need to sort things out to take money.
Oh, crap, hooligans are all I need.
I'll stick to the tea.
And a tea.
-Are you from Paris?
-Yes, I am.
Paris Saint Germain!
Exactly.
You know, the PSG doesn't run fast enough.
No fears.
Spread out, guys!
Come on, wake up you Spice Girls.
Get your Nepalese passport
if you're on their side!
If you want to piss,
go over there, don't talk to me!
Did you still fight well?
Oh, we stuck in there!
We're proud of you, mate!
So what's next?
No more towns. It's just stones from here.
Sounds interesting.
So from now it's straight to the top?
No, tomorrow we're leaving
to base camp.
It's at 17,000 ft.
It's getting serious.
Frankly, I never thought
I'd go so high up.
Since you've been gone,
our listeners have tripled.
You have fans all over France, it's crazy.
People are listening to you
instead of going to work.
That said, no one
has ever really worked here.
Take care of yourself.
Don't worry.
I'm in control.
Bye, guys!
Oh shit, it's Mt. Everest,
it's Mt. Everest!
No, it's Mt. Lhotse.
-Mt. Lho...?
-Mt. Lhotse.
-Mt. Lho...
-Mt. Lhotse.
-27,940 ft.
-Of course, Mt. Lhotse.
-I need to stop stopping like that.
-Maybe.
Beautiful, huh?
Don't watch.
Don't look back.
Keep up the pace, Samy!
Keep up the pace...
Look up, Samy.
Make your mind up.
Look up.
-He didn't even call this morning.
-I know.
So you're listening in now?
No, my mum told me.
You're the only one here not listening.
It doesn't mean
I'm not thinking about him.
I hope nothing's happened to him.
There's probably no signal, that's all.
Hello.
"The phone kept ringing,
but nobody answered,
only the echo of the tone
losing itself in Clara's house.
At the other end of the line,
Jonathan cried
and couldn't hang up."
Of course she's in love,
she digs him, but he doesn't know it.
-He never shows.
-Shows?
Like a magic show. With rabbits.
He never compliments her.
Plus, he's loaded,
so he gets all the girls he wants.
So Clara dumped him.
Now she's the one giving him
a hard time, understand?
A bit.
Women are like mountains, Johnny.
You have to be worthy of them.
Understand?
It's six o'clock. Welcome to Radio Nomad.
You're with Ben and Max
until nine o'clock.
Couldn't we say "Max and Ben" for once?
You're with Max and Ben...
Hear that, mum! It's for me!
And sadly, no Samy.
No, he's climbing Mt. Everest
for a girl's love.
Sorry! He hasn't called
for three days now.
Try unlocking an iPhone in mittens.
So he left
ten days ago,
the last time we spoke,
he'd reached 13,000 ft,
bringing him halfway to the top
of the highest summit in the world!
With a guy from the estate on the top!
Our answerphone
is crowded with messages.
We picked some out.
So it's time
to give the listeners the mic.
Hi, it's Nedjma, I'm from Val-d'Oise.
If Nadia dumps you,
I'll have you whenever you like!
I've left my picture on the website.
OK, Nedjma,
we'll get you his phone number!
What a slag.
Where the hell are you?
Look.
Oh, yeah.
From now on,
one step,
one breath.
And above all, don't stop anymore.
I get the one step, one breath thing.

It's Mr. Diakhaté, Samy's father!
Hello, Mr. Diakhaté. I'm glad you called.
Yes, I'm worried too, sir.
Why are we stopping?
For old friends.
They took my child!
They took my child! My love!
I want Samy!
CLIMBING EVEREST FOR LOVE: SAMY DISAPPEARS
It's just headlines, to sell their crap!
Next time don't let him go,
it'll make things easier.
What an idiot,
sending a Cameroonian there...
Senegalese... He's Senegalese.
I want all the pictures of my logo
off the website.
Got it?
No, sir!
We can't take the pictures down.
No, we can't blur them either.
But because... I can't. No!
Shit, this is bad.
What a mess.
Are you busy tonight?
No.
I hope you're proud of yourself!
-Hello, Mrs. Diakhaté.
-Don't Mrs. Diakhaté me!
What have you done to my son?
Calm down.
It's none of your business!
Why did you send him away
to be killed in the mountains?
...my son would still be here!
If he's dead, it's your fault!
What are you doing here?
Where's your farmer?
All by yourself?
Are you the stubborn type?
Let me see your eyes.
Listen Chewbacca,
I've got something for you.
Wait.
Who's getting a sweet?
You've never had one of these.
Don't say no!
Plus, you don't have to worry
about the dentist.
Slowly.
It's good, huh?
See, it's good.
Don't tell your friends I gave you one
or they'll be after me.
Gotta go, they're waiting for me.
Look at the helicopter there!
Keep up the pace!
-We'll freeze at this speed!
-Each to his own pace!
I wasn't born in the Alps!
Stick to the path.
Damn.
Poor guys.
I don't know the way, Jeff!
I want a reliable guy.
You'll see I'm no loser
and I care about you.
- You'd do that for me?
-Nadia.
What am I doing here?
Try to go all the way this time.
Nadia?
You'd do that for me?
Bloody hell.
What the hell am I doing?
Okay Samy.
Pull yourself together.
You have to go on, not allowed to let go.
If you stop now, they'll all laugh at you.
Come on, Samy, come on!
Thanks God!
BASE CAMP - ALT. 17,598 FT
Well done, Samy!
Come on, get something hot to drink.
Congratulations.
Sit down, you're not at the top yet.
Welcome to Base Camp!
I like the red logo...
Hello, Radio Nomad?
Hello, it's Samy.
Oh crap, it's Samy!
Stay on the line!
They've found him!
Whatever you do, don't hang up!
Oh crap, I'm so happy!
It's Samy, it's Samy!
Hello Samy?
I can hear you.
Oh god, you scared the crap out of us!
You haven't called for five days!
Well guys, the package you got me
is rubbish!
Only satellite phones work.
-Are you OK? You're not ill?
-It's really cold, but it's OK.
-I'm at base camp.
-So over 16,400 ft?
17,600, it's crazy!
You rock mate!
But keep calling us, right?
I'm in the middle of nowhere.
There's no signal.
I can't call you all the time.
Evening is the best time.
Call tomorrow evening, we'll record it.
I wanted to ask you guys...
can you let my parents know that I'm OK?
-I can't really call from here.
-Of course.
We're on it buddy.
Thanks. Ciao.
-Mr. Diakhaté?
-Speaking.
It's Ben from Radio Nomad,
I've heard from your son.
Everything's fine.
Are you mad?
I could have broken my nose!
-He arrived at base camp.
-Give me your company's number.
Shut up!
And...
Sorry, Mr. Diakhaté?
No, no! Not you.
OK, he's fine and I'll call you
as soon as we hear from him.
That's very kind. Thank you so much.
They've just found my son.
-On Mt. Everest.
-OK...
Nadia, they've found him!
He's at base camp.
-Hello.
-Hello.
Didier.
Samy. Nice to meet you.
-Do I know you?
-I'm not sure... Maybe on TV?
Didier Fauconnier? The adventurer?
-No way!
-I just do nature shows.
You travel and get paid for it, come on!
It's still a lot of work.
Living in Seine-Saint-Denis's
a lot of work and there's no pay.
Yeah, I get it.
Ah, let me introduce my team.
Charlotte, my cameraman and director.
-Charlotte, Samy.
-Hi, Charlotte!
Hi, team!
-Are you here on shoot?
-I've already tried Everest twice.
Third time lucky.
I don't want to lose a third one.
I've been training in Argentina.
How about you?
Mostly Mt. St Michel.
The biscuits, I guess?
Three times a day.
Not many people here
manage first time round.
See the Australians there?
They're stopping here,
they just came for a walk.
That's why they were fueling like planes?
See the Koreans?
They'll probably get
to camp number four, max.
The Germans however,
are on their second try.
They'll make it this time.
Yeah, they're on fire.
-And the English?
-They'll stop at number two.
After that there's no more beer.
The most important
is to prepare for next time.
Stop right there,
I don't have the luxury
to pay for a second time.
Get this: a young man from the suburbs
climbs Everest for love.
You're kidding?
He's already at 17,400 ft.
OK for duty!
Remember to drink a lot of water.
Well, I've been doing that from the start.
We can take him higher?
For now, no problems.
That's good news!
Who's going to climb Mt. Everest?
-Know how to put that on?
-Come on, I'm not dumb!
See you at the wall.
Is the altitude making him sulky?
It's nuts.
I can do it.
I had the same on Mt. Kilimanjaro!
I think it's broken.
Funny, huh?
I'm not used to this model.
It must be extra small.
All by myself, look.
Tell Jeff I helped you put it on me, OK?
Oh, crap!
Hit and climb.
But? Who do I hit? Right to the top?
Come on, Samy!
It's your call.
Hit and climb.
OK, I get it.
Samy, your turn!
Doesn't this ice melt?
Hit and climb.
Not "climb and hit"?
Hit and climb. Hit and climb.
Come on, put your hands on the wall.
Go!
Hit, for Christ's sake!
Easier on Mt. Kilimanjaro, was it?
We haven't got all day! Shit!
I can't take it any more.
If you're not ready in three days,
you're out of here.
Bloody hell...
-Now go back down.
-Which way?
The way you came up, loser!
Louis de Funès!
Listen, Jeff.
The fun's over now.
This French loser
can't get up the small wall.
We don't want him in our team.
-He's dangerous.
-It's not your decision.
Oh, no.
No, no!
Sorry, I'm not in the mood to read to you.
If you want, we can sort it out.
It's all over.
You read, and I teach you to climb.
Sure you don't have family in Morocco?
Go on, climb!
That's good! Climb upwards!
Pull upwards!
Careful.
I'm spent.
Higher, higher.
Come on.
Dammit, Samy!
Up! Up! Everything's up here!
Hit and climb!
Hit and climb! What am I doing?
-Samy, up! Pull upwards.
-I can't believe it.
Come on, Samy!
Come on.
Was that good?
What? Didn't you see my abseiling?
You...
Hit and climb, again?
Oh yeah, I hit and I climb. Sugar!
"The bad-tempered man turned
into a charming-voiced seducer.
She couldn't push him away,
especially when he renewed his apology."
It's stuck!
Hit and climb!
Like with a hammer.
Yes, go on, climb!
How about that?
"Despite it all, she raised her head..."
Her mother hadn't wanted her
to be with Nico.
So Cony said... she doesn't care.
So! Are we climbing Everest or what?
Hit and climb!
Well done.
One mistake and you're at the bottom, OK?
-I'm fond of him!
-He's so nice!
Ben, Radio Nomad.
Florence from  Le Parisien .
We spoke on the phone.
Say, this is... a lively place!
Yes, especially
since the past three weeks!
-Thank you for having me.
-Let's go.
It's eight o'clock, welcome to the land
of concrete and unemployment!
Mountain dweller friends,
welcome to the highest radio in France!
What's that accent?
It's the only one I can do!
Thanks to one man from the suburbs
who's been making us live a dream
for the past 23 days,
since he left to climb the highest
mountain in the world, at 29,029 ft.
This man is called Samy Diakhaté.
Remember the name,
it'll soon be legendary,
siding with Usain Bolt and Muhammad Ali.
We recorded his call last night.
So ladies and gentlemen, exclusively,
Samy Diakhaté on Radio Nomad.
The station that takes you higher!
We need to reassure our growing number
of listeners. How are you?
I'm fine! Not bad.
The last rise was tough, but I'm fine.
-Where exactly is our hero?
-At camp number two.
-At 21,300 ft.
-That's far!
He's not even far, he's lost!
-What's it like?
-There are 20 tents standing around.
Is there a KFC?
No, no chicken wings for now.
How about supplies?
The Sherpas bring all our gear and food.
They work all day and night.
Where are you going?
To get equipment.
They're the real heroes.
You're a champion.
What's the next stage?
Two camps left before the top.
By when will you be at the top?
I might be up there in 72 hours.
We'll let you get some rest.
All right.
I'd like to say hi to my family.
My parents, brothers...
and especially Nadia.
If she's listening...
And big up to everyone,
from the estate and elsewhere.
I don't know if I'll make it to the top,
but if I'm here, it's thanks to you.
We're with you, Samy.
OK, thanks guys.
Ciao!
This is insane!
Where is Mt. Everest anyway?
I don't know, man.
Go on, check Google Earth.
Type in "Everest".
It should be east. Ever-east.
Thank you, goodbye.
Here, look!
SAMY DIAKHATHÉ'S FEAT
Sir?
Excuse me.
-That's my son!
-That's nice.
It's amazing! That's my son!
That's your brother!
At night the temperature
can drop to -40°C.
That's insane!
Is that all you can say?
Learn some vocabulary, bro'.
Have you ever opened a book before?
Your PlayStation manual doesn't count!
He's right, you know.
What do you mean?
Come on, Samy,
almost there.
ALT. 23,497 FT
"The end to this story
that floats away too,
like a leaf on the autumn wind.
But deep down,
Clara knows that love isn't far away.
She can feel the bud
being born again in her heart
like a flower feeling for spring."
Does that mean: they see again?
Of course, they will.
She's mad about him.
She acts all proud, but she's in love.
But you said he was a fool?
Yeah, I said he was a fool.
But that was before.
He's grown now.
-Now, he knows what's important.
-What's that?
What's important is that...
before you can love someone,
you have to love yourself.
It means you have to stop
going up and down.
Settle down, brother. Find a girl.
Take her out to dinner, talk to her,
and afterwards...
No, no!
-Never before marriage!
-Seriously?
Well, then get married and then...
Thanks.
I'm the one thanking you, bro'.
You've been great!
We'll sort something out!
Bad weather's closing in.
We have to leave now.
But it's 2 a.m.!
-It's now or in ten days.
-OK.
So we're leaving now!
One step. Two breaths.
Damn, no!
Jeff, my light's gone out.
Your pins will get you up there,
not your light.
Are you kidding? I can't see a thing.
Let the breathing guide you.
It's the same.
Are you taking me for Stevie Wonder?
Stevie Wonder never climbed mountains.
How are you?
Not so good.
This is hard!
ALT. 25,997 FT
I'm not going to make it.
Before we go back to the news,
a report on the young man
from La Courneuve.
His name is Samy Diakhaté,
and he decided last month,
with no experience,
to take on the highest mountain
in the world: Mt. Everest.
Today he is almost 26,300 ft up
and is about to make his dream come true.
Jérôme Brière
brings us the unusual portrait
of this young Frenchman,
who's gone from the 4,000 estate
to the top of the world.
Indeed Julian, all of Samy's friends
are proud of the feat
he's about to achieve.
He already had something else.
I always believed in him.
FRENCH TEACHER AT JACQUES BREL HIGHSCHOOL
Samy's the pride of the neighborhood.
It proves we're not just losers.
Give us a job and we'll get it done.
Exactly, mate.
We're doing something.
This is our place, see.
La Courneuve!
That's our Samy!
We took him to the station.
I sponsored him because I believed in him.
I knew he could go to the top.
Right away, I knew.
Only one step left to reach happiness,
but the highest step by far.
Indeed, he has entered
what alpinists call the death zone.
The most extreme cold on the planet,
where the oxygen is most rare.
Are you sleeping?
Guess.
The silence is worrying me.
-What was that?
-An avalanche.
Less worried?
-Should I have a look?
-Yes.
Nadia, it's me,
Samy.
I said I'd do anything for you.
Well, here I am.
I'm really out of control.
I don't even like the mountains.
I prefer the sea.
I'd love to take you to the seaside.
To lay on a deck chair
and sip cocktails all day.
Just you and me.
Just you and me.
I've got to go and try to get some sleep.
You know...
they say "out of sight, out of mind".
It's not true.
I'm just saying in case...
I just wanted you to know.
Lots of love.
Is this your phone?
Yes.
Next time you want to make a call ask me.
Yeah, no, because...
Will you be alright?
Yes.
Hello.
Hello. Can we see your parents?
Hello. Come in, please.
Thank you. Hello.
Sorry to bother you,
but my daughter
has something to say to you.
I just wanted to say...
that I've known Samy
since secondary school, and...
I've been in...
in love with him ever since.
You know, it's not easy here...
She's so pretty.
To be in love.
You have to be hard, strong.
You have to keep boys at a distance.
It's not easy to guard your feelings.
I feel really strongly about Samy,
but I was scared about everything,
scared he would... discard me,
wouldn't want me,
wouldn't take me seriously,
about being sad.
I'm sorry.
And now...
I'm not afraid at all,
not at all, and when he comes back
I want to give him all my love.
I just wanted to tell you.
Come here, my girl.
Thank you.
Thank you.
No more than five minutes without oxygen.
Is it just the two of us?
The Germans have left.
Don't waste time, get ready.
No, I'm not coming.
What do you mean?
Dorge is going with you.
But who's he?
Dorge.
OK, great.
So I'm going to be stuck
between two pit-bulls.
-Why him?
-Dorge is the only Sherpa
who can get you to the top.
You'll see, Mt. Blanc
will be easier after this.
-Charlotte?
-Yes?
In your phone
there's a number I've often called.
-Yes, I saw.
-It's the radio.
Can you tell them I've left?
I'll tell them you're coming back,
it'll be less scary.
Samy, it's not a good time, we're late.
Thank you.
Please, let go of your phone.
You're making me dizzy!
Sorry, I don't know what else to do.
There are ten pounds of potatoes
in the kitchen.
-Should I peel all of them?
-Given your state, yes.
It's dead!
You're doing this on purpose!
No, the radio, it's dead!
You're not going to leave my son
alone in the mountains!
-Hello.
-Hello.
Our radio's broken.
Come in, please.
-Hello.
-Hello, kids.
Hello Nadia. Can you put
the radio on for us, please?
Of course.
-Come in, sit down.
-Thank you.
Come on.
It's time to hand the mic over
to Ben and Max,
who have set their studio up
in La Courneuve
to follow the last hours
of Samy Diakhaté's ascent, live!
Can you hear me?
Yes, Richard!
We hear you!
We're in front of Samy's tower block
and it's crazy!
Did you make it?
No.
Good luck.
Big up to Mr. Menaz!
He's an important guy!
Mr. Menaz, you've been
a mountaineer since 1961
and a Himalaya specialist!
I've been there a few times, yes.
Samy left camp number four four hours ago,
so apparently
he's off for a 3,000 ft climb.
Is he almost there?
He's probably only just half way.
What's important isn't so much the pace,
it's not stopping.
Those are nice words. Mr. Menaz is wise.
Big up to him! Thank you.
Aren't the stars beautiful?
The stars...
What's up with you?
Damn, it's beautiful.
You know, my father,
used to hit me with his belt
to make me carry on.
He was a military man.
Heart like a stone.
You haven't spoken to me in a month.
Can't you wait for tonight
to tell me this?
And my mother... would plant...
in the garden...
We had a wheelbarrow.
He's out of it.
Take him back down!
I don't want his body on my hands!
Plus, I'm the only black guy for miles.
We'll get you back down.
We're not leaving you like this.
-It'll be fine, OK?
-Nice smell of jasmine.
Would you like to call your parents?
I'm sure you have loads to talk about.
You're a good son, Jeff.
You're a good son.
You're right.
We have things...
things to talk about.
Go all the way, Samy.
-Go all the way.
-Don't worry.
We've just received
a message from Charlotte
who's on site with Didier Fauconnier,
the great reporter, who's just given up.
The Germans also gave up a few hours ago.
But still no news from our main man Samy,
but we're backing him.
Stop telling me "come on"!
I can't go any further.
The voice of wisdom.
So now Samy is alone with his Sherpa.
Is that good or bad news?
Even with a group, it's all in the head.
He's probably been alone
for a few hours now.
-Is the Sherpa always easygoing?
-Yes.
Thank you, Mr. Menaz!
Wait.
You're making me nervous,
and I can't breathe already.
What is it?
There's only 15 feet left!
Listen.
I can't come back next year!
No, dammit!
Listen, bro'.
Take me up, please!
Come on, take me up.
Take me up, I'm begging you.
Thank you, Dorge.
ALT. 29,029 FT
Wait!
Take a picture or they won't believe me!
Here.
Shoot, it's digital bro', shoot!
We did it!
Charlotte has sent us something
to put on the screen.
Five, four,
three, two, one.
Samy's on top of the world!
Seine-Saint-Denis is at the summit!
The estate's at the top!
He made it!
Nadia.
ONE MONTH LATER...
You've got style, brother.
The crazy climber. What's up?
That's insane, man.
Namaste, bro'!
Well done.
You owe me a kiss, don't you?
Don't you want us to make a baby first?
On the 25th of May 2008,
Namir Dendoune
became the first Franco-Algerian
to climb Mt. Everest,
arriving at 29,029 ft
with no experience...
