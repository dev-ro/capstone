150 years ago
the business corporation
was a relatively
insignificant institution.
Today it is all pervasive.
Like the church
the monarchy
and the communist party
in other times and places
the corporation is today's
dominant institution.
This documentary
examines the nature
evolution impacts and
possible futures
of the modern
business corporation.
Initially given a narrow
legal mandate
what has allowed today's
corporation to achieve
such extraordinary power
and influence over our lives?
We begin our inquiry as
scandals threaten to trigger
a wide debate about the lack
of public control
over big corporations.
I think there is an overhang
over the market of distrust.
Listen 95 percent
or some percent
huge percentage
of the business
community are honest
and unreveal
all their assets
got compensation
programs that are balanced.
But there are
some bad apples...
the media debate about
the basic operating principles
of the corporate world
was quickly reduced
to a game of
follow the leader.
I still happen to think
the United States
is the greatest place
in the world to invest.
We have some shake ups
that are going on
because of a few
bad apples.
Some people call me
a bad apple
but I may be bruised
but I still taste sweet.
Some people call me
a bad apple
but I may be the sweetest
apple on the tree.
These are not just
a bunch of bad apples.
This is just
a few bad apples.
This is not just
a few bad apples.
You've gotta get rid
of the bad apples
You can start
with Tyco
Bad apples
We know all
about WorldCom.
Bad apples
Xerox Corporation.
Bad apples
Arthur Anderson.
Bad apples
Enron obviously
bad apples.
K- mart Corporation
Bad apples
the fruit cart is
getting a little more full.
I don't think it's just a
few apples unfortunately.
I think this is the worst
crisis of confidence
in business.
What's wrong
with this picture?
Can we not pick
a better metaphor
to describe the dominant
institution of our time?
Through the voices of CEOs
whistle blowers
brokers gurus and spies
insiders and outsiders
we present the corporation
as a paradox
an institution which
creates great wealth
but causes enormous
and often hidden harms.
I see the corporation
as part of a jigsaw
in society as a whole
which if you remove it
the picture's incomplete.
But equally if it's
the only part
it's not going to work.
A sports team.
Some of us are
blocking and tackling.
Some of us
are running the ball
some of us are
throwing the ball.
But we all have
a common purpose
which is to succeed
as an organization.
A corporations
like a family unit.
People in a corporation work
together for a common end
Like the telephone system
it reaches almost
everywhere.
It's extraordinarily powerful
it's pretty hard to avoid.
And it transforms
the lives of people
I think on balance
for the better.
The eagle
soaring clear eyed
competitive
prepared to strike
but not a vulture.
Noble visionary majestic
that people can believe in
and be inspired by
that creates such
a lift that it soars.
I can see that being
a good logo
for the principled
company.
Okay guys
enough bullshit.
Corporations are
artificial creations.
You might say
they're monsters
trying to devour as much
profit as possible
at anyone's expense.
I think of a whale.
A gentle big fish
which could swallow you
in an instant.
Dr. Frankenstein's creation
has overwhelmed and
overpowered him.
As the corporate form
has done with us.
The word corporate gets
attached in almost
you know in a
pejorative sense to
and gets married
with the word agenda.
And one hears a lot about
the corporate agenda
as though it is evil
as though it is an agenda
which is trying
to take over the world.
Personally I don't
use the word "corporation"
I use the word business.
I will use the word
use the word company.
I will use the words
business community
cause I think that is a much
fairer representation
than zeroing in on just
this word corporation.
It's funny that I've taught
in a business school
for as long as I have
without ever having
been asked so pointedly
to say what I think
a corporation is.
...it is one form of
business ownership...?
It's a group of individuals
working together to serve
a variety of objectives.
The principal one
of which is earning large
growing sustained
legal returns
for the people who
own the business.
The modern corporation has
grown out of the industrial age.
The industrial age
began in 1712
with an Englishman named
Thomas Newcomen
invented a steam driven
pump to pump water
out of the English coalmine
so the English coalminers
could get more
coal to mine
rather than hauling
buckets of water
out of the mine
It was all about productivity
more coal per man hour.
That was the dawn of
the industrial age.
And then it became more
steel per man hour
more textiles
per man hour
more automobiles
per man hour
and today it's more
chips per man hour
more gizmos per man hour.
The system is basically
the same system
producing more
sophisticated products today.
The dominant role of
corporations in our lives
is essentially a product of
roughly the past century.
Corporations were originally
associations of people
who were chartered
by a state
to perform some
particular function.
Like a group of people
want to build abridge
over the Charles River
or something like that.
There were very few
chartered corporations
in early United
States history.
And the ones that existed
had clear stipulations
in their state
issued charters
how long they
could operate
the amount of
capitalization
what they made or did
or maintained
a turnpike whatever was
in their charter
and they didn't
do anything else.
They didn't own or couldn't
own another corporation.
Their shareholders
were liable.
And so on.
In both law and the culture
the corporation was considered
a subordinate entity that was
a gift from the people
in order to serve
the public good.
So you have that history
and we shouldn't
be misled by it
it's not as if these
were the halcyon days
when all corporations
served the public trust
but there's a lot
to learn from that.
The Civil War and the
Industrial Revolution
created enormous growth
in corporations.
And so there was an explosion
of railroads
who got large federal
subsidies of land.
Banking heavily
manufacturing
And corporate lawyers
a century and a half ago
realized that they needed
more power to operate
And wanted to remove some
of the constraints
that had historically been
placed on the corporate form.
The 14th amendment
was passed
at the end of the Civil War
to give equal rights
to black people.
And therefore it said
No state can deprive
any person of life
liberty or property
without due process of law.
And that was intended
to prevent the states
from taking away life
liberty or property
from black people
as they had done
for so much of
our history.
And what happens is the
corporations come into court
and corporation lawyers
are very clever.
And they say
Oh you cant deprive
a person of life
liberty or property.
We are a person.
A corporation is a person.
And so supreme court
goes along with that.
And what was particularly
grotesque about this was
that the 14th amendment
was passed
to protect newly
freed slaves.
So for instance
between 1890 and 1910
there were 307 cases brought
before the court
under the 14th amendment.
288 of these brought
by corporations
19 by African Americans.
600000 people were killed
to get rights for people
and then with strokes of
the pen over the next 30 years
judges applied those rights
to capital and property
while stripping them
from people.
Everybody makes a mistake
once in a while
but I just cant be
personally responsible.
That's one of the weaknesses
of a partnership
isn't it Sid?
Well maybe you'd better
incorporate the store.
Incorporate?!
Yes
Incorporating would give you
the big advantage of
what you want right now
limited liability.
You start with a
group of people
who wanna invest their
money in accompany.
Then these people apply for
a charter as a corporation.
This government issues a
charter to that corporation.
Now that corporation operates
legally as an individual person
it is not a group of people
it is under the law
a legal person.
Imperial Steel Incorporated
has many of the legal rights
of a person.
It can buy and
sell property...
It can borrow money.
It can sue in court
and be sued.
It can carry
on a business.
Imperial Steel
along with thousands
of other legal persons
is a part of our
daily living.
It is a member
of our society.
Having acquired the legal rights
and protections of a person
the question arises
What kind of person
is the corporation?
Corporations were given
the rights of immortal persons.
But then special
kinds of persons
persons who had no
moral conscience.
These are a special
kind of persons
which are designed by law
to be concerned
only for their
stockholders.
And not say what
are sometimes
called their stakeholders
like the community or the
work force or whatever.
The great problems of having
corporate citizens
is that they aren't
like the rest of us.
As Baron Thurlow in England
is supposed to have said
They have no soul to save
and they have no body
to incarcerate.
I believe the mistake that
a lot of people make
when they think
about corporations
is they think you know
corporations are like us.
General Electric is a kind
old man with lots of stories.
Nike young energetic.
Microsoft aggressive
McDonald's young
outgoing enthusiastic
Monsanto immaculately dressed
Disney goofy.
The Body Shop
um deceptive
very lovely.
Do you know what the
body shop is?
Nope.
They have feelings
they have politics
they have belief systems
they really only
have one thing
the bottom line
How to make as much
money as they can
in any given quarter.
That's it.
Of course they
make a profit
and it's a good thing.
That's the incentive that
makes capitalism work.
To give us more
of the things that wanted.
That's the incentive that
other economic systems lack.
People accuse
us of only paying attention
to the economic leg
because they think
that's what a business
persons mind set is
it's just money.
And it's not so
because we as
business people
know that wanted to certainly
address the environment
but also wanted to be seen as
constructive members
of society.
There are companies that do
good for the communities.
They produce
services and goods
that are of value to all of us
that make our
lives better
and that's a good thing.
The problem comes in in
the profit motivation here
because these people
there's no such
thing as enough.
And I always
counterpoint out
there's no organization
on this planet
that can neglect
its economic foundation.
Even someone living under
a banyan tree is dependent
on support from someone.
Economic leg has to be
addressed by everyone.
It's not just
a business issue.
But unlike someone
under a banyan tree
all publicly
traded corporations
has been structured
through a series
of legal decisions
to have a peculiar and
disturbing characteristic.
They are required
by law
to place the financial
interests of their owners
above competing interests.
In fact the corporation
is legally bound
to put its bottom line
ahead of everything else
even the public good.
That's not
a law of nature
that's a very
specific decision.
In fact
a judicial decision.
So they're concerned only
for the short term profit
of their stockholders who are
very highly concentrated.
To whom do these
companies owe loyalty?
What does loyalty mean?
Well it turns
out that
that was a rather
naive concept anyways
as corporations are
always owed obligation
to themselves to get large
and to get profitable.
In doing this
it tends to be more
profitable to the extent
it can make other
people pay for the bills
for its impact
on society.
There's a terrible word that
economists use for this
called externalities.
An externality is the effect
of a transaction
between two individuals.
Third party who
has not consented to
or played any role
in the carrying out
of that transaction
And there are real
problems in that area.
There's no
doubt about it.
Running a business is
a tough proposition.
There are costs to be
minimized at every turn
and at some point
the corporation says
you know let somebody
else deal with that.
Let's let somebody else
supply the military power
to the middle east to protect
the oil at its source.
Let's let somebody else build
the roads that we can drive
these automobiles on.
Let's let somebody
else have those problems
And that is where
externalities come from
that notion of let somebody
else deal with that.
I got all I can
handle myself.
A corporation is an
externalizing machine
in the same way that a shark
is a killing machine.
Each one is designed
in a very efficient way
to accomplish
particular objectives.
In the achievement
of those objectives
there isn't any question
of malevolence or of will.
The enterprise
has within it
and the shark
has within it
those characteristics that
enable it to do that
for which it was designed.
The pressure is
on the corporation
to deliver results now
and to externalize
any cost
that this unwary
or uncaring public
will allow it
to eternalize.
To determine the kind
of personality
that drives the corporation
to behave like
an externalizing machine
we can analyze it
like a psychiatrist
would a patient.
We can even formulate
a diagnosis
on the basis of typical
case histories of harm
that is inflicted
on others
selected from a universe
of corporate activity.
Well this is the office
of the national
labour committee
here in the garment area
of New York City.
It's a little
bit dishevelled.
These are all from
different campaigns.
To make this stuff
concrete as possible
we purchased all of
the products from the factories
that we're talking about.
This shirt sells
for $14.99.
And the women who made
this shirt got paid $0.03.
Liz Claiborne jackets
made in El Salvador
The jackets are $178
and the workers were
paid $0.74
for every jacket they made.
Alpine car stereos
$0.31 an hour.
It's not just sneakers.
It's not just apparel.
It's everything.
We were in Honduras
and some workers they knew
what kind of work we did
and they approached
us and said
conditions in our
factory are horrible.
Will you please
meet with us.
And we said we would.
But you cant meet in
the developing world
you cant walk up in
a factory with your notebook
and workers come
up and interview them.
I mean there's
goons there's spies
the military police
so you do everything
in a clandestine manner.
We are about
to start the meeting
and in walk three guys
very tough looking guys.
The company had found
out about our meeting
and sent these spies.
Obviously we didn't
have the meeting.
But these young girls
were really bright
And as they
were leaving
away from the eyesight
of the spies
they started to put their hands
underneath the table.
And I put my hand
under there
and they put into my hand
their pay stubs.
So wed know
who they were
what they were paid
and the labels that
they made in the factory
so wed know who
they worked for.
So I took my hand
after everyone had left.
And in the palm
of my hand
was the face was of
Kathy Lee Gifford
And on the bottom
of it was
A portion of the proceeds
from the sale of this garment
would be donated to various
children's charities.
Very touching
gets you right here.
Wal-Mart is telling you
if you purchase these pants
and Kathy Lee
is telling you
if you purchase
these pants
you will be
helping children.
The problem was
the people that
handed us this label
were 13 years of age.
Do many people
in your family work here?
Just me.
How many people
do you support?
Eight people?
And how do you do it with
that salary is it enough?
No.
Let's look at it from
a different point of view
Let's look at it
from a point of view
of the people in Bangladesh
who are starving to death.
The people in China
who are starving to death
and the only thing that they
have to offer to anybody
that is worth anything
is their low
cost labour.
And in effect what
they're saying to the world
is they have this big
flag that says
Come over and hire us.
We will work
for $0.10 an hour.
Because $0.10 an hour
will buy us the rice
that's wanted not
to starve.
And come and rescue us
from our circumstance.
And so when Nike comes in
they are regarded by
everybody in the community
as an enormous godsend.
Hey wait!
You are not
permitted to be here!
The door was wide open.
No no no no no.
That's my clothes.
Those are my clothes.
This is not your clothes.
Why your camera!?
Don't touch the woman.
Why!?
This is a private company.
Without permission
how can you come here?
Yes well the door
was wide open
The doors
for employees
not for you.
We went through
the garbage dump
in the Dominican
Republic.
We always do this
kind of stuff
we dig around.
One day we found
a big pile
of Nikes internal
pricing documents.
Nike assigns a time
frame to each operation.
They don't talk
about minutes.
They break the timeframe into
ten thousandths of a second.
You get to the bottom
of all 22 operations;
they give the workers 6.6
minutes to make the shirt.
It's $0.70 an hour
in the Dominican Republic.
That's 6.6 minutes
equals $0.08.
These are Nikes documents.
That means the wages come to
three tenths of one percent
of the retail price.
This is the reality.
It's the science
of exploitation.
What happens in the areas
where these corporations
go in and are successful?
They soon find that they cant
do anymore in that country
because the wages
are too high now.
And what's that another
way of saying
well the people are
no longer desperate.
So okay we've used up
all the desperate people there
they're all plump and
healthy and wealthy.
Let's move on to the next
desperate lot and employ them
and raise their level up.
Well the whole idea of
the export processing zone
is that it will be the
first step towards
this wonderful
new development
through the investment that's
attracted to these countries
there will be
a trickle down effect
into the communities.
But because so many countries
are now in the game
of creating these
free trade enclaves
they have to keep providing
more and more incentives
for companies to come to their
little denationalized pocket.
And the tax holidays
get longer.
So the workers rarely
make enough money
to buy
three meals a days
let alone feed
their local economy.
Something happened in 1940
which marked the beginning
of a new era.
The era of the ability
to synthesize and create.
On an unlimited scale
new chemicals that had
never existed before
in the world.
And using the
magic of research
oil companies compete
with each other
in taking the petroleum
molecule apart
and rearranging it into
well you name it...
So suddenly it became possible
to produce any new chemical
synthetic chemicals
the likes of which had never
existed before in the world
for any purpose and
at virtually no cost.
Fabrics toot brushes
tires insecticides
cosmetics weed killers.
A whole galaxy of things to
make a better life on earth.
For instance if you wanted
to go to a chemist and say
look I want to have
a chemical say a pesticide
which will persist
throughout the food chain
and I don't want to have
to renew it very very often
Id like it to be
relatively non-destructible
and then he'd put two
benzene molecules
on the blackboard and
add a chlorine here
and a chlorine there
that was DDT!
When the eighth army needed
Jap civilians to help them out
in our occupation
they called on native
doctors to administer DDT
under the supervision
of our men
to stand a potential
typhus epidemic.
Dusting like this goes a long
way in checking disease
and the laughs on them.
"Pardon our dust"
As the petrochemical
era grew and grew
warning signs emerged that
some of these chemicals
could pose hazards.
The data initially were
trivial anecdotal
but gradually a body of data
started accumulating
to the extent that we now know
that the synthetic chemicals
which have permeated
our workplace
our consumer products
our air our water
produced cancer
and also birth defects
and some other
toxic effects.
Furthermore industry
has known about this
at least most industries
have known about this
and have attempted
to trivialize these risks.
If I take a gun and shoot
you that's criminal.
If I expose you
to some chemicals
which knowingly are
going to kill you
what difference is there?
The difference is that it
takes longer to kill you.
We are now in the midst
of a major cancer epidemic
and I have no doubt
and I have documented
the basis for this
that industry is
largely responsible
for this overwhelming
epidemic of cancer
in which one in every two men
get cancer in their lifetimes
and one in every three
women get cancer.
Towards the end
of 1989
a great box of documents
arrived at my office
without any indication
where they came from.
And I opened them
and found in it a complete
set of Monsanto files
dealing with toxicological
testing of cows
who'd been given RBGH.
BST trade name Posilac is
being used in more than
a quarter of the dairy herds
in the United States
according to Monsanto.
The milk is being drunk
by a large portion
of the American population
since the food and drug
administration declared it safe
for both cows and humans...
And at that the
Monsanto was saying
There's no
evidence whatsoever
of any adverse affects
We don't use antibiotics.
And this clearly showed
that they had lied
through their teeth.
The files described areas
of chronic inflammation
in the heart lungs
kidneys spleen
also reproductive effects
also a whole series
of other problems.
...the most comprehensive
independent assessment of the drug
"concludes that bust
results in un necessary pain
suffering and
distress for the cows.
This is not acceptable
for a drug designed simply
to increase milk production...
It is a silly product.
We have the industrial
world is a wash in milk.
We're over producing milk.
We actually have governments
around the world
who pay farmers not
to produce milk.
So the first product
Monsanto comes up with
is a product that produces
more of what we don't need.
Of course you'll want to inject
Posilac in every eligible cow
as each cow is not treated
is a lost income opportunity.
But the problem was
that use of
the artificial hormone
caused all sorts of
problems for the cows.
It caused something
called mastitis
which is a very painful
infection of the udders.
When you milk the cow
if the cow
has bad mastitis
some of the
and I don't know how to
say this in a you know
I hope people aren't
watching at dinnertime
but the pus from the
infection of the udders
ends up in the milk.
And the somatic cell
count they call it
the bacteria count
inside your
milk goes up.
There's accost to the cows.
The cows get sicker when
they're injected with RBGH.
They're injected
with antibiotics.
We know that people are
consuming antibiotics
through their food
and we know that
that's contributing
to antibiotic resistant
bacteria and diseases.
And we know we're at a
crisis when somebody can go
into a hospital and
get a staff infection
and it cant be
cured and they die.
That's a crisis.
Bad for the cow
Bad for the farmer
Bad potentially
for the consumer
The jury is out
we see a lot of
conflicting evidence
about potential
health risk.
And of course
as a consumer
my belief is why
should I take any risk?
Factory farm cows have not
been the only victims
of Monsanto products.
Large areas of Vietnam were
deforested by the us military
using Monsanto's agent orange.
The toxic herbicide
reportedly caused
over 50000 birth defects
and hundreds of thousands of cancers
in Vietnamese civilians and soldiers
and in former American troops
serving in South East Asia.
Unlike the Vietnamese victims
U.S. Vietnam war veterans
exposed to Agent Orange
were able to sue Monsanto
for causing their illnesses.
Monsanto settled
out of court
paying $80 million
in damages.
But it never
admitted guilt
Sleeping in a motel
in Brewer Maine one night
I woke up with
terrible hay fever
and my eyes were burning.
And I looked out
at the river
and there were great
mounds of white foam
going right
down the river.
And the next morning
I got up and I said
My God what was
that happening last night
He said "Oh that's
just the river".
And I said
"what do you mean?"
He said "Well look every
night the paper company sends
the stuff down the river."
And I said "What are
you talking about?"
And he said "Don't
you understand?"
"That show we get rid of the
effluent from the paper mills."
Well I knew at that time
I had been in the business.
I had sold oil
to the paper mills.
I knew all the owners.
I had been in politics.
I knew the people
in the towns.
I knew not one constituent
of the paper mills
wanted to have
the river polluted.
And yet here the river
was being polluted.
And it was more or less as
if we created a doom machine.
In our search for wealth
and for prosperity
we created something that's
going to destroy us.
The traders who are
involved in the market
are not guys
who are
whose moral fibre
when it comes to
environmental conditions
are going to be
rattled at all
They're seeing dollars
and they're making money.
Brokers don't stay away
from copper
because it violates
their religious beliefs
or your environmental
policies.
No.
There are times
when you think about it
but it's fleeting.
It really is
a fleeting moment.
It's like yeah
oh yeah yeah
well a town is being
polluted down there in Peru
but hey this guy
needs to buy some copper.
L'm getting paid
a commission too.
Our information that we receive
does not include anything
about the environmental
conditions
because until
the environmental conditions
become a commodity
themselves or are being traded
then obviously we will not
have anything to do with that.
It doesn't come into
our psyche at all.
It's so far away and
it's you hardly hear
anything about it.
I mean keep in mind there are
things going on right in our
backyards for god sake.
We trade live hogs.
I mean there are so many pigs
in the state of Carolina
and they're
polluting the rivers
but how often do you
find out about that?
At Multinational Monitor
we've put together a list
of the top corporate
criminals of the 1990s.
We went back and looked at
all the criminal fines that
corporations had
paid in the decade.
Exxon pled guilty in connection
to federal criminal charges
with the Valdez spill and paid
$125 million in criminal fines.
General Electric
was guilty of defrauding
the federal government
and paid $9.5 million
in criminal fines.
Chevron was guilty of
environmental violations
and paid $6.5 million
in fines.
Mitsubishi was guilty
of anti-trust violations
and paid $1.8 million in fines.
IBM was guilty of
illegal exports and paid.
Eastman Kodak was guilty of
environmental violations.
Pfizer the drug manufacturer
was guilty of
antitrust violations.
Odwalla was guilty of food and
drug regulatory violations.
Sears was guilty of...
Damon Clinical Laboratories
was guilty of...
Blue Cross Blue
Shield was guilty of
Again and again we have
the problem
that whether you obey
the law or not
is a matter whether
its cost effective.
If the chance
of getting caught
and the penalties are less
than it costs to comply
people think of it as
just a business decision.
Drawing the metaphor of
the early attempts to fly.
Theban going off of a very
high cliff in his airplane
with the wings flapping
and the guys
flapping the wings
and the wind
is in his face
and this poor fool
think she's flying
but in fact
he's in freefall
and he just doesn't
know it yet
because the ground
is so far away
but of course the craft
is doomed to crash.
That's the way our
civilization is
the very high cliff
represents the virtually
united resources
we seem to have when
we began this journey.
The craft isn't flying
because it's not built according
to the laws of aerodynamics
and is subject
to the law of gravity.
Civilization is not flying
because it's not built according
to the laws of aerodynamics
for civilizations
that would fly.
And of course the ground
is still a long way away
but some people have seen
that ground rushing up
sooner than
the rest of us have.
The visionaries have seen it
and have told us its coming.
There's not a
single scientific
peer reviewed paper published
in the last 25 years
that would contradict
this scenario
Every living system
of earth
is in decline
every life support system
of earth is in decline
and these together
constitute the biosphere
the biosphere that supports
and nurtures all of life
not just our life but perhaps
30 million other species
that share
this planet with us.
The typical company
of the 20th century
extractive wasteful
abusive linear
in all of its processes
taking from the earth
making wasting
sending its products
back to the biosphere
waste to a landfill...
I myself was amazed to learn
just how much stuff
the earth has to produce
through our extraction process
to produce a dollar of
revenue for our company.
When I learnt
I was flabbergasted.
We are leaving a terrible
legacy of poison
and diminishment
of the environment
for our grandchildren's
grandchildren
generations not yet born.
Some people have called that
intergeneration tyranny
a form of taxation
without representation
levied by us
on generations yet to be.
It's the wrong
thing to do.
One of the questions
that comes up periodically
is to what extent could
corporation be considered
to be psychopathic.
And if we look at a corporation
as a legal person
that it may not be that
difficult to actually draw
the transition between
psychopathy in the individual
to psychopathy
in a corporation.
We could go through
the characteristics
that define this particular
disorder one by one
and see how they might
apply to corporations.
They would have all
the characteristics
and in fact
in many respects
the corporation
of that sort
is the proto typical
of a psychopath.
If the dominant institution
of our time has been created
in the image of
a psychopath
who bears moral responsibility
for its actions?
Can a building have
moral opinions?
Can a building have
social responsibility?
If a building cant have
social responsibility
what does it mean to
say a corporation can?
A corporation is simply
an artificial legal structure
but the people
who are engaged in it
whether the stockholder
whether the
executives in it
whether the employees
they all have
moral responsibilities.
It's a fair assumption
that every human being
real human beings
flesh and
blood ones
not corporations
but every flesh and blood
human being is a moral person.
You know we've
got the same genes
we're more or less
the same
but our nature
the nature of humans
allows all kinds
of behaviour.
I mean everyone of us
under some circumstances
could be a gas chamber
attendant and a saint.
No job in my experience
with Goodyear
has been as frustrating
as the CEO job.
Because even though
the perception is
that you have absolute power
to do whatever you want
the reality is
you don't have that power
and so metes if you had
really free hand
if you really did what
you wanted to do
that suits your
personal thoughts
and your personal priorities
you'd act differently.
But as a CEOm
you cannot do that
Layoff shave become
so wide-spread
that people
tend to believe that
CEOs make these decisions
without any consideration
to the human implications
of their decisions
It is never a decision
that any CEO makes lightly.
It is a tough decision.
But it is the consequence
of modern capitalism
When you look
at a corporation
just like when
you look at a slave owner
you want to distinguish
between the institution
and the individual.
So slavery for example
or other forms of tyranny
are inherently monstrous
but the individuals
participating in them
may be the nicest guys
you could imagine
benevolent friendly
nice to their children
even nice to their slaves
caring about other people.
I mean as individuals
they may be anything.
In their institutional
role they're monsters
because the institution
is monstrous.
Then the same is true here.
My wife and I some years
ago had a tour home
a demonstration.
25 people arrived
they hung a big banner
on the top of our house
saying murderers
they danced around outside
with gasmasks and so on.
As a public demonstration
it wasn't very effective
due to the fact that this
is a very rural area
two people and a dog
and it's not
a very big house
which I think rather
surprised them
but then we sat down
and talked to them
for a couple of hours
and we gave them
tea and coffee
and they had
lunch on our lawn.
After about 20
minutes they said
Well the problem is
not you. It's Shell.
And I said now wait a
minute lets talk about
what is Shell?
It's made up
of people like me.
In the end what we
found in that discussion
were all the things
they we're worried about
I was worried about as well
climate oppressive
regimes human rights
the big difference
between us was
I feel that I can actually
make a contributions to this
these people
were frustrated
because they felt that
they had no nothing to do.
So an individual
CEO lets say
may really care
about the environment
and in fact
since they have such
extraordinary resources
they can even devote some of
their resources to that
without violating
their responsibility
to be totally inhuman
which is why
as the Moody Starts
serve tea to protestors
Shell Nigeria can flare
unrivalled amounts of gas
making it of the worlds single
worst sources of pollution.
And all the professed concerns
about the environment
do not spare Ken Saro Wiwa
and eight other activists
from being hung for opposing
Shells environment practices
in the Niger Delta.
The corporation
is not a person
it doesn't think.
People in it think
and for them it is legitimate
to create terminator technology.
So that farmers are not
able to save their seeds.
Seeds that will
destroy themselves
through a suicide gene.
Seeds that are designed to only
produce crop in one season.
You really need to
have a brutal mind.
It's a war against evolution
to even think in those terms.
But quite clearly profits are
so much higher in their minds
The profit motive
which drove Klutzy
to accomplish so much
may bring out the evil
as well as the good...
Hellooo?
My work spans
all industry sectors
I mean I virtually have
worked for like Id say
25 percent
of the fortune 500.
L've posed as
an investment banker.
L've posed as a
venture capitalist.
L've set up
front companies
that are executive
recruiting firms.
Essentially I'm a spy.
I'll locate
your employees
and I will tell them
that I'm calling
from Acme
Recruiting Agency
and that I've got a
job that pays them
considerably more than
what they're paying.
Would they mind meeting
me for an interview?
And when the executive
shows up
what he doesn't
realize is
I'm actually debriefing him
on behalf of a competitor.
That there is no job
and that the office
that he's at
has been rented
and the picture on my desk
of my family is a phoney
and it's all just a big
elaborate ruse
to glean competitive
information from him.
I don't feel any guilt.
It's you know what I mean
you have to expect
that guys like me
are out there.
We're predators.
It's about competition
it's about market share
it's about
being aggressive
and it's about
shareholder value.
What is your
stock at today?
If you're a CEO
I mean do you think your
shareholders really care
whether you're Billie
Buttercup or not?
Do you think that
they really
they would prefer you
to be a nice guy?
Over having money
in their pocket?
I don't think so.
I think people want money.
That's the bottom line.
The fact that most of these
companies are run
by white men
white rich men
means that they
are out of touch
with what the majority
of the world is.
Because the majority
of this planet
are not a bunch
of rich white guys.
They are people
of other colours
they are the majority.
Women are the majority
the poor
and working poor
make up the majority
of this planet.
So the decisions
they make
come from not the reality
that exists in the world.
How much is enough?
How much is enough?
If you are a billionaire
would it be okay just
to be a half a billionaire?
Wouldn't it be okay
for your company
to make a little
less money...
When I bought those
two airplane tickets
for Phil Knight and myself
to fly to Indonesia
I was prepared for him
to say okay lets go.
Oh no not a chance
Not a chance.
No?
They're transferable.
I can change it
to another day.
And call me on it.
Call my bluff.
He's a smart guy.
I mean he's not
he's not stupid.
And so I thought okay
get ready for this.
Especially because you know
I bought first-class tickets.
So you know it would be a
comfortable ride at least
you know and of course he
tells me then on camera.
L've never been to Indonesia.
And I'm like taken
aback by this.
I cant believe it.
The guys the head
of the company
he's never walked through
his own factories.
Oh you've got to go.
I cant go right now and
the rest of this year.
When we were done
filming he calls me up
a couple of weeks
later and he goes
I may have a chance to go
there with you to the factories.
L'm going to the Australian
Open to watch some tennis.
And uh you know
maybe I can get up there
or at least
you can go there.
Would you like to go
to the Australian open?
For 21 years
I never gave a thought
to what we were taking
from the earth or
doing to the earth
in the making
of our products.
And then
in the summer of 1994
we began to hear questions
from our customers
we had never
heard before
What's your company doing
for the environment?
And we didn't have answers.
The real answer
was not very much.
And it really disturbed
many of our people
not me so
much as them
and a group in our
research department
decided to convene
a taskforce
and bring people from our
businesses around the world
to come together
to assess
our company's world wide
environment position
to begin to frame answers
for those customers.
They asked me if I would come
and speak to that group
and give them
a kick off speech
and launch this new task force
with an environmental vision
and I didn't have
an environmental vision
and I did not want
to make that speech.
And at sort of
the propitious moment
this book
landed on my desk.
It was Paul Hawkins book
The Ecology of Commerce
and I began to read The
Ecology of Commerce,
really desperate
for inspiration
and very quickly
into that book
I found the phrase
The death of birth.
It was E.O. Wilson's expression
for species extinction
The death of birth
and it was a point
of a spear into my chest
and I read on and
the spear went deeper
and it became an
epiphanal experience
a total change
of mindset for myself
and a change of paradigm.
Can any product be
made sustainably?
Well not any
and every product.
Can you make
landmines sustainably?
Well I don't think so.
There's a more fundamental
question than that
about landmines.
Some products ought
not to be made at all.
Unless we can make carpets
sustainably you know
perhaps we don't have a place
in a sustainable world
but neither does anybody else
making products unsustainably.
One day early in this journey
it dawned on me that
the way Id been
running interface
is the way
of the plunderer
plundering something
that's not mine
something that belongs
to every creature on earth
and I said to myself
my goodness
the day must come
when this is illegal
when plundering
is not allowed
it must come.
So I said to
myself my goodness
some day people like
me will end up in jail.
L've got to be
honest with you.
When the September 11th
situation happened
I didn't know that
the and I must say
and I want to say
this because its
I don't want
to take it lightly
it's not a light
situation.
It's a devastating act.
It was really a bad thing
it's one of
the worse things
I've seen in my
lifetime you know.
But I will tell you and every
trader will tell you
who was not in
that building
and who was buying gold
and who owned gold and silver
that when it happened
the first thing
you thought about was
well how much is gold up?
The first thing
that came to mind was
my god gold must
be exploding.
Fortunately for us all
our clients were in gold.
So when it went up they
all doubled their money.
They've all doubled
their money.
It was a blessing
in disguise.
Devastating you know
crushing heart shattering
but on the
financial sense
for my clients that
were in the market
they all made money.
Now I wasn't looking
for this type of help
but it happened.
When the us bombed
Iraq back in 1991
the price of oil went
from $13 to $40 a barrel
for Christ sake!
Now we couldn't wait
for the bombs
to start raining down
on Saddam Hussein.
We were all excited.
We wanted Saddam to
really create problems
Do whatever you
have to do
set fire to some
more oil wells
because the price is
going to go higher.
Every broker was
chanting that
there was not a broker
that I know of
that wasn't
excited about that.
This was a disaster.
This was something
that was you know
catastrophe happening.
Bombing wars
In devastation there
is opportunity.
The pursuit of profit
is an old story
but there was a time when
many things were regarded
either as too sacred or too
essential for the public good
to be considered business
opportunities.
They were protected
by tradition
and public regulation.
We can really begin to take
a look at the emergence
of the modern age with
the enclosure movements
of the great European
commons in the fourteenth
fifteenth and
sixteenth century.
Medieval life uh was
a collectively lived life
It was a brutish
nasty affair.
But there was a collective
responsibility
People belonged to the land;
the land did not belong
to the people.
And in this
European world
people farmed the land
in a collective way
because they saw
it as a commons.
It belonged to God.
And then it was
administered by the church
the aristocracy
and then the local manors
as stewards of gods creation.
Beginning with Tudor England
we began to see
a phenomenon emerge
and that is the enclosure
of the great commons
by Parliamentary
Acts in England
and then in Europe.
And so first we began to
take the great landmasses
of the world
which were
commons and shared
and we reduced those
to private property.
Then we went after the oceans
the great oceanic commons
and we created laws
and regulations
that would allow countries
to claim a certain amount
of water outside
their coastal limits
for exploitation.
In this century we
went after the air
and we divided it
into air corridors
that could be bought
and sold
for commercial traffic
for airplanes.
And then of course
the rest is history.
With deregulation
privatization free trade
what we're seeing is
yet another enclosure
and if you like private
taking of the commons.
One of the things I find
very interesting
in our current debates
is this concept
of who creates wealth.
That wealth is only created
when it's owned privately.
What would you call
clean water fresh air
a safe environment?
Are they not
a form of wealth?
And why does it only become
wealth when some entity
puts a fence around it and
declares it private property?
Well you know that's
not wealth creation.
That's wealth usurpation.
Over the centuries
we have put more and more
things in that public realm
and lately just lately
in the last
lets say in the last
three or four decades
started pulling
them out again.
So fire-fighters
for instance.
Fire-fighters started
as private companies
and if you didn't
have the medallion
of a given
fire-fighter brigade
on your house and
it was on fire
those fire-fighters
would just ride on by
because you didn't
have a deal.
Well it gradually
evolved a public trust
for the provision of safety
on that very specific level.
This is important.
We should not go back
from that and start saying
well you know why don't we
put that back in the market
and see what that does?
Maybe it will make
it more efficient
Privatization does not mean
you take a public institution
and give it
to some nice person.
It means you take a public
institution and give it
to an unaccountable tyranny.
Public institutions
have many side benefits
For one thing they may
purposely run at a loss.
They're not
out for profit.
They may purposely
run at a loss
because of the
side benefits.
So for example if a public
steel industry runs at a loss
it's providing cheap
steel to other industries
maybe that's a good thing.
Public institutions can have
a counter cyclic property
So that means that they can
maintain employment
in periods of recession
which increases demand
which helps you
get out of recession.
Private companies cant
do that in a recession
throw out the work force cause
that's the way you make money.
There are those who intend
that one day everything
will be owned by somebody
and we're not just
talking goods here.
We're talking human
rights human services
essential services for life.
Education public health
social assistance
pensions housing.
We're also talking about
the survival of the planet.
The areas that we believe
must be maintained
in the commons
or under common control
or we will collectively die
Water and air.
Even in the case of air
there's been some progress
and that is the trading
of pollution permits.
And here the idea
is to say
look we cant avoid
the dumping of carbon dioxide.
We cant avoid the dumping
of sulphur oxides
at least we cant at the moment
afford to stopping it
so we're dumping a certain
amount of stuff
into the environment.
So we're going to say
with the current tonnage
of sulphur oxides
for example
we will say
that is the limit.
And well create
permits for that amount
and give them to the people
who've been doing the polluting
and now we will permit
them to be traded.
And so now there's
a price attached
to polluting the environment.
Now wouldn't it be marvellous
if we have one of those prices
for everything?
It sounds like you're
advocating private ownership
of every square
inch of the planet.
Absolutely.
Every cubic foot
of air water.
It sounds outlandish to say
we want to have the
whole universe
the whole of
the earth owned.
That doesn't mean I
want to have Joe Bloggs
owning this square foot.
But it means the interests that
are involved in that stream
are owned by some group
or by some people who have
an interest in maintaining it.
And that you know that
is not such a loony idea.
It's in fact the solution
to a lot of these problems.
Imagine a world in
which one of the things
owned by a corporation was
the song happy birthday.
In fact
an Aol/Time Warner subsidiary
holds the copyright.
In the past
it has demanded
over $10000
to allow you to hear anyone
sing this popular song
in a film.
We didn't pay.
We preferred to use the money
to fly our crew to Boston
and Los Angeles to bring
you the following story
Comparing the marketing
of yesteryear
to the marketing of today
is like comparing
a B.B. Gun to a smart bomb.
It's not the same
as when I was a kid
or even when the people
who are young adults
today were kids.
It's much more sophisticated
and it's much more pervasive.
It's not that products
themselves are bad or good.
It's the notion of
manipulating children
into buying the products.
In 1998 Western
International Media
Century City and Lieberman
Research Worldwide
conducted a study on nagging.
We asked parents to keep
a diary for three weeks
and to record every time
you could imagine
every time their child nagged
them for a product
we asked them to record
when where and why.
This study was not to
help parents cope with nagging.
It was to help corporations
help children nag
for their products
more effectively.
Anywhere form 20 percent
to 40 percent of purchases
would not have occurred
unless the child had
nagged their parents.
That is we
found for example
a quarter of all visits
to theme parks
wouldn't have occurred unless
a child nagged their parents.
Four out of ten visits
to places like Chuck E. Cheese
would not have occurred.
And any parent would
understand that
you know when I
think of Chuck E. Cheese
oh my goodness
its noise.
And there's
so many kids.
Why would I want to
spend two hours there?
But if the child nags
enough you 're going to go
We saw the same thing with
movies with home video
with fast food...
We do have to break
through this barrier
where they do tell us
or they say
they don't like it
when their kid snag.
Well that's just a general
attitude that they possess.
It doesn't mean that they
necessarily act upon it
a 100 percent of the time.
You can manipulate
consumers into wanting
and therefore buying
your products.
It's a game.
Children are
not little adults;
their minds
aren't developed.
And what's happening is that
the marketers are playing
to their developmental
vulnerabilities.
The advertising that
children are exposed to today
is honed by psychologists;
it's enhanced by
media technology
that nobody ever
thought was possible.
The more insight you have
about the consumer
the more creative you'll be in
your communication strategies.
So if that takes
a psychologist
yeah we want one
of those on staff.
L'm not saying it's wrong
to make things for children.
I also think its
important to distinguish
between psychologists who
work on products for children
to help you know toy
corporations make toys
that are developmentally
appropriate.
I think that's great
that's different
from selling the toys
directly to the children.
Initiative is huge.
I think in
the U.S. We place
about $12 billion
of media time.
So well put it on TV
well put it in print
well put it up in outdoor
well buy radio time;
so we're the biggest buyers of
advertising time and space
in the U.S.
And in the world.
One family cannot combat
an industry that spends
$12 billion a year trying
to get their children.
They cant do it.
They are tomorrows
adult consumers
To start talking with them now
build that relationship
when they're younger...
And you've got
them as an adult.
Somebody asked me you
know Lucy is that ethical?
You know you're essentially
manipulating these children.
Well yeah
is it ethical?
I don't know.
But our role at initiative
is to move products
And if we know
you move products
with a certain
creative execution
placed in a certain
type of media vehicle
then we've
done our job.
Every institution
provides the people
who are members of it
with asocial
role to occupy
And typically institutions
that are vibrant
and have a lot of power
will specify that role
in some sense as
a list of virtues.
It's true for churches
for schools
for any institution that
has power over people
and shapes them.
The corporation likewise.
It provides us
with a list of virtues
a kind of social role
which is
the good consumer.
Like the waters
of the mighty ocean
people also represent
tremendous force
the understanding of which
is the greatest importance
to the American
way of life.
This force is known
as consumer power.
The goal for the corporations
is to maximize profit
and market share.
And they also have a goal
for their target
namely the population.
They have to be turned into
completely mindless consumers
of goods that
they do not want.
You have to develop what
are called created wants
So you have
to create wants.
You have to pose
on people what's called
a philosophy of futility.
You have to focus them
on the insignificant
things of life
like fashionable consumption.
L'm just basically quoting
business literature.
And it makes
perfect sense.
The ideal is to have
individuals
who are totally disassociated
from one another.
Who's conception of
themselves the sense of value
is just how many created
wants can I satisfy?
These people are customers
because they are willing
to trade money for widgets.
And all the customers
take the widgets home
to all parts
of the country.
Look at all the money
the widget builder has
taken in from the sale
of his widgets.
We have huge industries
public relations industry
monstrous industry
advertising and so on
which are designed
from infancy to try
to mould people
into this desired pattern.
We saw
Tiger Woods on TV
with a hat
with a Nike logo on it
and we figured you know
he probably gets
like millions of dollars
just to wear the hat
on a press conference.
And therefore we figured we
can do that for someone else.
And hopefully get money in
time so we can go to school.
And that show we came up with
being corporately sponsored.
We made our sponsor
announcement
on the Today Show
on June 18
...were thrilled to be
sponsored by First U.S.A...
We're thrilled to be working with
first U.S.A as our corporate
sponsor and they're covering
our college tuition...
...we found First U.S.A as our
sponsor and we're proud
to be working with them...
...our sponsor if First U.S. A
we're really thrilled
to announce First U.S. A
as our sponsor...
...we're thrilled to be
working with First U.S. A...
and so we give First U.S. A
a good name in the media
and include them
in our news stories
and through there
they get as much advertising
as we can give them.
They'll be conforming
not to the wishes of
demanding parents
but to the wishes of an image
conscious corporation...
They're not just out there for
the money and they're just...
I mean they want
to work with us
and be our friends and let
us help them help us
and vice versa.
And we became
walking billboards
to pay for our
college tuition.
Cool Site of the day
picked us as a cool site
and Yahoo picked us and
we were in U.S.A Today.
When we did our photo
shoot for people magazine
