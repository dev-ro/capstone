Allah answered your prayers.

-Thank you.
-It is the least that I can do.
The situation
has become critical.
Patriarch loves him.
And the people of Egypt
love him, too.
We have to
find a way.
Our lives
are at stake.
Don't you think you are
being a little dramatic?
No, we cannot take the risk
of him becoming a Patriarch.
He's not fit
for the position.
He would give
every cent away
to native Arabs
and beggars.
There would be
nothing left!
Maybe he is
good-hearted and all that...
but definitely crazy.
A fanatic,
I would say.
I'm not even sure
about his good heart.
He's a fake.
Remember he said "thank you"
response at the banquet?
What "thank you" response?
This "thank you" response.
"Oh, your Eminence,
we only want you to
become our next Patriarch.
We only want you,
Your Eminence!"
"Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Thank--"
Thank God
you're not an actor.
He consorts
with harlots on the streets.
The Patriarch
would certainly not like that.
Metropolitan Nektarios
is the Patriarch's
spiritual child,
his creation.
We need something
more substantial
to convince the Patriarch
to turn on him.
This is not
going to be easy.
Things are much easier
than what you are
making it out to be.
Patriarch Sophronius
was a Patriarch
of Constantinople
before he became
the Patriarch of Alexandria.
He was kicked out
after three years
because of, uh,
some kind of unrest.
He claims that,
uh, he was betrayed
by one of his men
closest to him.
He's scared to death
of losing his seat again.
He will not take any chances
when it comes to it.
Are you talking about
my son, Nektarios?
Is that
who you are saying
is plotting against me?
[Bishop]
I'm sorry, Your Holiness,
but it's him
we're talking about.
I know it is hard
for you to believe
that he can be a Judas,
but it's true, Your Holiness.
It is not hard for me
to believe that.
This flesh is filth!
[indistinct] Judas!
Your Holiness.
We strongly recommend
that you don't see
or speak to him again.
I need to be alone.
We are trying to
protect you, Your Holiness.
Get out.
All of you.
Out!

Forgive me, Your Eminence.
But you know
what I think about that.
You must have faith.
With all
the injustice and poverty,
it is hard
to have faith.
[Nektarios]
You're right.
It's a lot of
injustice and suffering.
But that is exactly
why I believe
that our life here
is not all there is.
I have some faith

They keep sending letters.
Most of them

[Nektarios] I left.
Why don't they leave me alone?
If they grant

But I don't want to
replace the Patriarch.
[Bishop 2]
They don't know that.
And they certainly

I will leave

You can't do that.

Permit me to ask,
gentlemen,
where are

In the church
not far from here.
Unfortunately, one cannot
perform services here
due to the condition
of the chapel.
Something needs
to be done about this.
Obviously,
Your Eminence,
but the funds
are simply not available.
We will

This is

Permit me to correct you,

This is not only
an ecclesiastical school.
It is a regular
high school as well.
And our primary focus
is to provide
our students
with an excellent education.
[Nektarios]
I understand.
But if we
attend to the chapel
and make this place
look more appealing,
we will attract
more students
who will be able
to get an excellent education.
Of course,
I just can't see
how we can achieve
something like that.
Like I said,
the funds
are extremely limited.
As a new director,
I will do my best
to help with that.
I'm happy

Punishing yourself

It looks like
your primary focus

Not everyone

We just came out

400 years of Ottoman
oppression and slavery.
Education is vital

-Of course.
You are cultivating
asceticism in our students,

No, I have a perfect view

It is a radical
approach to religion.
It's long [indistinct]

outwardly, of course.
A true ascetic
does not worry about
the outwardly
appearance at all.

He's, in effect,
a true Christian.
Are you
a true Christian?

[President Rizarios]
Your appointment at this school
has not been filed

you were expelled

I was slandered.
[President Rizarios]
Of course you were.
[Nektarios] Did you request
background check on me?
No, Your Eminence.
We only asked for information
in an official capacity.
So, the Patriarchal trust
is bluntly informed
the civil representative
of the Greek government
that I was removed
from my position
because I was,
"rebellious,
unethical and immoral"?
Mr. Riparis finishes
the letter clearly stating
that he believes
you're a perfect cleric
who was unjustly slandered.
But slander keeps following me,
doesn't it?
Where are my accusers?
Where are the witnesses?
Where is
the evidence of my crime?
On what grounds?
After four years
of my unjust
departure from Egypt,
was this official
accusation of me made,
an accusation that
condemns me to immoral death.
What great wrong
did I do against you,
Your Holiness?
Why is there
such a great wrath
and pursuit against me,
seeking my total destruction?
The purpose
of my outdated protest
is to bring you to
the knowledge of Your Holiness
that your every rough

May God be
my witness and judge.
Vassili,

You mop

If you continue

Oh, no, don't even joke

Honest and hard
work is not beneath anyone.

I had to call
this meeting, gentlemen,
as a medical emergency
concerning
our student, Nicholas.
He has had fever
for over two weeks.
His condition looks critical.
And even
after doctors' treatments,
it is not getting
any better.
Nor do
the doctors have any idea
what is wrong
with him.
His illness
seems to be
of a mental nature.
Therefore, I suggest
we transfer him
to the sanatorium.
We need to inform
his guardian right away.
We cannot do
such a thing.
He needs to go
to the hospital
to be properly treated
and diagnosed,
which is
right across the street.
Not some sanatorium
far away from here.
After all,
he does have a fever.
He is here
on a minimum tuition.
I doubt he can afford
additional treatment
of any kind.
We should
pay for it.
It's the least
that we can do
for the child who has been
studying here so diligently.
We can't bear
such an expense, Your Eminence.
He's here
on a partial scholarship.
I think we already
did more than doing the least.
We should inform his guardian
immediately of our decision.
[Nektarios]
I will pay for it myself.

We ran all possible tests.
We don't know

but we're expecting
the worst by tomorrow.

What is going on, my son?
You are holding
something heavy inside of you.
Whatever it is,
know that God loves you
and wants you
to do great things.
God has forgotten
about me.
Why do you say that?
I studied hard...
so that
I could come here
and--
and help my father
and my sisters.
But it was
all for nothing.
[paper rustling]
My father has--
has killed himself.
And my step-mother sent
my sisters into servitude.
So, you see,
God wants me
to die.
Let's see about that.

When did this idea
about becoming nuns come about?
We have talked
about it for a long time
and we have all decided
that we really
want to do that.
Your desire
is indeed beautiful...
but are you aware...
that by becoming a nun,
you're accepting poverty
and a very difficult life?
We are aware of it.
Our life
has not been easy.
We all grew up
as orphans in extreme poverty.
Hardships don't scare us
as long as
we can stay together.
Only a few
are chosen to take this path.
You must be
truly ready and willing
to go through it
until the end.
We are, Your Eminence.
Is there a place
where you would like to go?
Have you visited
any monasteries?
We visited quite a few,
but it's hard to find a place
that will take all of us.
And we want
to remain together.

would be to find a place
where we can
establish the convent.
