 Choose life. Choose
a job. Choose a career. Choose a family.
Choose a fucking big television.
Choose washing machines, cars...
compact disc players
and electrical tin openers.
- Gangway! Run!
- Choose good health...
Iow cholesterol
and dental insurance.
Choose fixed-interest
mortgage payments.
Choose a starter home.
Choose your friends.
Choose leisure wear
and matching luggage.
Choose a three-piece suite on hire
purchase in a range of fucking fabrics.
Chose D.I.Y. and wondering who the fuck
you are on a Sunday morning.
Choose sitting on that couch
watching mind-numbing,
spirit-crushing game shows...
stuffing fucking junk food
into your mouth.
- Jammy goal!
 Choose rotting away
at the end of it all.
Pissing your last in a miserable home;
nothing more than an embarrassment...
to the selfish, fucked-up brats
that you've spawned to replace yourself.
Choose your future.
Choose life.
 Here comes Johnny
Yeah, yeah
- But why would I want
to do a thing like that?
 He's gonna do
another striptease
- I chose not to choose life.
I chose something else.
And the reasons?
There are no reasons.
Who needs reasons
when you've got heroin?
 Yeah, a song called love
 Well, dance like you're
hypnotized chickens
"Goldfinger's" better than "Dr. No."
Both of them are a lot better than
"Diamonds Are Forever."
A judgment reflected in its relatively
poor showing at the box office.
And in which field,
of course...
"Thunderball" was a notable success.
 People think
it's all about misery and desperation...
and death and all that shite,
which is not to be ignored.
Fuck off!
Jealous cunt.
 But what they
forget is the pleasure of it.
- They're all dead, right, mate?
You prick!
Otherwise we wouldn't do it.
- Do you want me to?
- Yeah.
Pure as the driven snow,
that shit you done.
After all, we're not fucking stupid.
At least we're not that fucking stupid.
Take the best orgasm you've ever had...
multiply it by a thousand,
and you're still nowhere near it.
It beats any meat injection.
That beats any fucking cock
in the world.
 When you're on
junk, you have only one worry: scoring.
And when you're off it,
you're suddenly obliged to worry
about all sorts of other shite.
Got no money, can't get drunk.
Got money, drinkin' too much.
Can't get a girl, no chance of a ride.
Got a girl, too much hassle.
You have to worry
about bills, about food...
about some football team
that never fucking wins.
About human relationships and all
the things that really don't matter...
when you've got a sincere
and truthful junk habit.
I'd say, in those days,
he was a muscular actor.
With all the presence of someone
like Cooper or Lancaster...
but combined
with a sly wit...
-to make him a formidable romantic lead.
And closer, in that respect,
to Cary Grant.
Ahh.
 Hey, man, where'd you
get that illusion
 The only drawback,
or at least the principal drawback...
is that you have to endure all manner
of cunts telling you that -
No way would I poison my body
with that shite.
All them fucking chemicals.
No fucking way.
It's a waste of your life, man...
poisoning your body
with that shite.
Every chance you've had, son,
you've blown it.
Stuffing your veins
with that filth.
 From time to time,
even I have uttered the magic words.
Never again, Swanney.
I'm off the skag.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, no more.
- I'm finished with that shite.
- Well, that's up to you, man.
Gonna do it right this time. Gonna get
it sorted out, get off it for good.
- I'm sure I've heard that one before.
- The Sick Boy method.
Oh, well, it really worked
for him, eh?
Well, he's always been
lacking in moral fiber.
- He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
- That's hardly a substitute.
- You need one more hit?
- No, I don't think so.
- For the long night that lies ahead?
We called him Mother Superior...
on account of the length
of his habit.
Of course, I'd have another shot.
After all, I had work to do.
 Relinquishing junk.
Stage one: preparation.
For this, you will need one room
which you will not leave.
Soothing music.
Tomato soup, ten tins of.
Mushroom soup, eight tins of,
for consumption cold.
Ice cream, vanilla,
one large tub of.
Magnesia, milk of,
one bottle.
Paracetamol, mouthwash, vitamins.
Mineral water,
Lucozade, pornography.
One mattress.
One bucket for urine...
one for feces
and one for vomitus.
One television and one bottle
of Valium, which I've already
procured from my mother...
who is, in her own domestic and socially
acceptable way, also a drug addict.
Now I'm ready. All I need is
one final hit to soothe the pain...
while the Valium takes effect.
Mikey? Aye, yeah,
it's Mark Renton.
Look, I wondered,
could you help me out?
This was typical of Mikey Forrester.
What the fuck are these?
Under the normal run of things...
I would have nothing to do
with the cunt, but this was not
the normal run of things.
Opium suppositories.
Ideal for your purposes.
Slow release,
bring you down gradually.
-Custom-fucking-designed for your needs.
-I want a fucking hit.
That's all I've got, man.
Take it or leave it.
- Are you feeling better now then, eh?
- Oh, aye.
For all the good they've done, I might
as well have stuck them up my arse.
Heroin makes you constipated.
The heroin from my last hit
is fading away...
and the suppositories
have yet to melt.
I'm no longer constipated.
 I fantasize
about a massive pristine convenience.
Brilliant gold taps, virginal white
marble, a seat carved from ebony...
a cistern full of Chanel No. 5
and a flunky...
handing me pieces
of raw silk toilet roll.
But under the circumstances,
I'll settle for anywhere.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, my -
Yes, a fucking dancer!
And now, now I'm ready.
The downside of coming off junk
was I knew...
I would need to mix
with my friends again...
in a state
of full consciousness.
It was awful.
They reminded me so much of myself
I could hardly bear to look at them.
Take Sick Boy, for instance.
He came off junk at the same time as me.
Not because he wanted to,
you understand, but just to annoy me.
Just to show me how easily
he could do it.
Thereby, downgrading my own struggle.
Sneaky fucker,
don't you think?
And when all I wanted to do was
lie there and feel sorry for myself...
he insisted on telling me once again
about his unifying theory of life.
It's certainly a phenomenon
in all walks of life.
What do you mean?
Well, at one point, you've got it,
then you lose it.
And it's gone forever.
All walks of life.
Georgie Best, for example,
had it, lost it.
Or David Bowie or Lou Reed.
Lou Reed.
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
No, it's not bad,
but it's not great either, is it?
And in your heart you kind of know
that although it sounds all right...
it's actually just shite.
So, who else?
- Charlie Nicholas, David Niven,
Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley -
- Okay, okay, okay.
So what is the point
you're trying to make?
 All I am trying
to do, Mark...
is to help you understand that "The
Name of the Rose" is merely a blip...
on an otherwise uninterrupted
downward trajectory.
What about
"The Untouchables"?
- I don't rate that at all.
- Despite the Academy Award?
That means fuck-all.
It's a sympathy vote.
So, we all get old.
We can't hack it anymore and that's it?
- Yeah.
- That's your theory?
Yeah.
Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.
Do you see the beast?
Have you got it in your sights?
Clear enough, Miss Moneypenny.
- This should present
no significant problems.
- Fucking hell! Get away -
- For a vegetarian, Rents,
you're a fuckin' evil shot.
No! Get off!
- Without heroin...
I attempted to lead a useful
and fulfilling life as a good citizen.
- Good luck, Spud.
- Cheers, cowboy.
Now remember, if they think you're
not trying, you're in trouble, right?
First hint of that, and they'll be onto
the D.H.S.S., "This cunt is not trying."
And your giro's
fuckin' finished, right?
- Right.
- But, then again, try too hard -
- You might get the fuckin' job.
- Exactly.
- Nightmare.
- It's a tightrope, Spud.
It's a fuckin' tightrope.
See, I just get pure shy with
the interviewer cats. I get all nervous.
I can't answer any of their questions,
like I'm a footballer...
and I get nerves
on the big occasion, man.
- Try some of this, Spud.
- Yeah, a little dab of speed
is just the ticket, mate.
No, I went to Craignewton.
I just put down Royal Edinburgh College
to help get the job.
There's too much discrimination
in this town, man.
They're both schools, right?
We're all in this together.
And I wanted to put across the
general idea, rather than the details.
Like people get all
hung up on details.
Like which school did I go to?
How many grades did I get?
Could be like six. Could be none.
It's not important.
What is important
is that I am, yes?
- Mr. Murphy, do you mean that
you lied on your application?
- No - Well, yes.
Only to get my foot
in the door.
Showing initiative
and that like.
But you were referred here
by the Department of Employment.
There was no need for you to get your
"foot in the door," as you put it.
Yeah, cool. Whatever you say. Sorry.
You're the man, the dude in the chair.
I am merely here - Like, well,
obviously, I'm here like, but -
Mr. Murphy, what exactly attracts you
to the leisure industry?
In a word, pleasure.
Like, my pleasure
in other people's leisure.
Do you see yourself
as having any weaknesses?
Oh, yes, 'cause, like, I'm a bit
of a perfectionist, actually!
Yes, I am. See, for me, it's got to be
the best, or it's nothing at all.
Like things get a bit dodgy,
I just cannot be bothered.
But, hey, I'm getting good vibes about
this interview thing today, though, man.
Seems to me like it's going
pretty well, eh?
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.
- We'll let you know.
- The pleasure was mine, man.
Spud had done well. I was proud of him.
- Thanks. Ooh, sorry.
- He fucked up good and proper.
You had to hand it to Spud.
 Picture the scene.
The other fuckin' week there...
doin' the fuckin' Volley
with Tommy playing pool.
I'm playin' like
Paul-fuckin'-Newman by the way...
givin' the boy here
the tannin' of a lifetime.
So it comes to the last shot, the
deciding ball of the whole tournament.
I'm in the black, and he's sittin'
in the corner looking all
fucking biscuit-arsed.
When this hard cunt comes in.
Obviously fucking fancied himself like.
Starts staring at me.
Looking at me, right fucking at me,
as if to say, "Come ahead, square go."
You know me. I'm not the type of cunt
that goes looking for fucking bother...
but at the end of the day,
I'm the cunt with the pool cue...
and he can get the fat end in his puss
any time he fucking wanted, like.
So I squares up, casual like.
What does the hard cunt do?
Or the so-called hard cunt? Shites it.
Puts down his drink,
turns and gets the fuck out of there.
And after that, well,
the game was mine.
 And that was it.
That was Begbie's story...
or, at least, that was
Begbie's version of the story.
But a couple of days later,
I got the truth from Tommy.
You always got the truth from Tommy.
That was one of his major weaknesses.
He never told lies, he never took drugs,
and he never cheated on anyone.
It was Wednesday morning. We were in the
Volley playing pool. That much is true.
But Begbie is playing
absolutely fucking gash.
He's got a hangover so bad,
he can hardly hold the fucking cue,
never mind pot a ball.
I'm doing my best to lose,
you know.
Trying to humor him, like,
but it's not doing any good.
Every time I touch a ball,
I seemed to pot something.
Every time Begbie goes near the table,
he fucks it up.
Oh, fuck's sake.
So, he's got the hump, right.
But, finally,
I managed to set it up...
so all he has to do
is to pot the black...
to win one game,
to salvage a little bit of pride...
and maybe not
kick my head in, right.
So, he's on the black.
- Pressure shot.
- And it all goes wrong big time.
- Fuck!
 He picks on
this specky, wee gadge at the bar...
- and accuses him of putting
him off by looking at him.
Could you believe it? The poor wee cunt
hasn't even glanced in our direction.
- Fuck off!
- He was gonna chib him, I tell you.
Then I thought
he was gonna do me.
The beggar's fucking psycho, man.
But... he's a mate.
You know?
So what can you do?
Can I borrow this?
What, indeed, could one do?
Just stand back and watch
and try not to get involved?
 Begbie didn't
do drugs either. He just did people.
- That's what he got off on.
His own sensory addiction.
- Hey!
Nobody move!
- That lassie got glassed...
and no cunt leaves here
'til we find out what cunt did it!
- Who the fuck are you?
- Oh, Lizzy, you've been so good to me.
- Oh, Tommy, come here.
And as I sat watching...
the intimate
and highly personal video...
stolen only hours earlier
from one of my best friends...
I realized that something important
was missing from my life.
 Leave no track
 Don't look back
- Only desire
- Temptation
- We're climbing higher and higher
- Temptation
- Adorable creature
- Temptation
- You've got acceptable features
- Temptation
- Trouble is coming
- Temptation
- It's just the high cost of loving
- Temptation
- You can take it or leave it
- Temptation
 But you'd better believe it
- I read it in Cosmopolitan.
- It's an interesting theory.
Actually, it's a nightmare.
I've been desperate for a shag,
but watching him suffer
is just too much fun.
You should try it with Tommy.
What? And deny myself
the only pleasure I get from him?
- Did I tell you about my birthday?
- No, what happened?
He forgot.
Useless motherfucker.
 Leave no trace
 Find your place
- All I desire
- Temptation
- We're climbing higher and higher
- Temptation
- You can take it or leave it
- Temptation
 But you'd better believe it
- What are you two talking about?
- Football.
- What are you talking about?
- Shopping.
The situation was becoming serious.
Young Renton noticed...
the haste with which the successful
in the sexual sphere...
as in all others,
segregated themselves from the failures.
- I can't break away
- Keep us from temptation
 Keep us from temptation
 Heroin had robbed
Renton of his sex drive...
- but now it returned with a vengeance.
- Lead us not into temptation
And as the impotence
of those days faded into memory...
grim desperation took ahold
in his sex-crazed mind.
His post-junk libido,
fueled by alcohol and amphetamine...
taunted him remorselessly
with his own unsatisfied desire.
Dot, dot, dot.
- You think that you're right now
- Temptation
- You've got to face up to fact now
- Temptation
- Ooh, give me a breakdown
- Temptation
- Because it's time for a showdown
- Temptation
 Temptation, Temptation
Temptation
 Oh, oh-oh-oh
 Make me tonight
 Tonight
 And with that,
Mark Renton had fallen in love.
Excuse me, excuse me. I don't mean to
harass you, but I was very impressed...
with the capable and stylish manner
in which you dealt with that situation.
I was thinking to myself,
now this girl's special.
Thanks.
- What's your name?
- Diane.
- Where are you going, Diane?
- I'm going home.
- Where's that?
- It's where I live.
- Great.
- What?
I'll come back with you if you like,
but I'm not promising anything.
Do you find that
this approach usually works?
Or, let me guess,
you've never tried it before.
In fact, you don't normally
approach girls. Am I right?
The truth is that you're
a quiet, sensitive type...
but, if I'm prepared
to take a chance...
I might just get to know
the inner you:
witty, adventurous,
passionate, loving, loyal -
Taxi!
A little bit crazy,
a little bit bad.
But, hey, don't us girls
just love that?
Eh?
Well... what's wrong, boy?
Cat got your tongue?
- I left something -
- You getting in or not, pal?
- Do you understand?
I expect you to be a considerate
and thoughtful lover.
Generous but firm.
- What?
- Failure on your part...
to live up to these
very reasonable expectations...
will result in swift resumption
of a non-sex situation.
Right?
- Diane.
- Shh.
- What?
 Shut up!
Wake up, Spud.
- Wake up.
- Sex.
Casual sex.
- Tommy, let's put the tape on.
- Now?
I want to watch ourselves
while we're screwing.
So let's see
what I'm missing.
Not much.
And there's the captain,
Archie Gemmill...
picking it up
from the outside.
I think he wants to go himself.
How far is he gonna go?
He's going all the way,
and he scores!
- Oh, what a magnificent goal!
- Gemmill at his very best!
What a penetrating goal that was!
 I haven't felt that good...
since Archie Gemmill scored
against Holland in 1978.
- Renton...
- you can't sleep here.
- What?
Out.
- Come on.
- No argument.
You can sleep on the sofa in the hall
or go home. It's up to you.
And don't make any noise.
Jesus.
 What do you mean, it's gone?
Where has it gone, Tommy?
It'll be here somewhere!
I might have returned it
by mistake.
"Returned it"? Where?
The video shop, Tommy?
The fucking video shop?
So every punter in Edinburgh
is jerking off to our video?
Oh, God, Tommy,
I feel sick!
- Hi.
- Hello.
Eh?
Come in and sit down.
- Like some coffee?
- Aye.
- You must be Mark.
- Aye, that's me.
- You're a friend of Diane's?
- More a friend of a friend, no?
Right.
Are you her flatmates?
 "Flatmates"?
- I must remember that one.
 'Morning.
- Good morning, Spud.
- 'Morning, Gail. Mr. Houston.
- Mrs. Houston.
- 'Morning, Spud.
Sit down and have some breakfast.
Sorry about last night,
by the way.
That's all right.
I slept fine on the sofa.
I had a bit much to drink.
I had a bit of an accident.
Don't worry, son.
These things happen.
Does a man good
to cut loose once in awhile.
Only this one could do
with being tied up once in a while.
I'll put the sheets
in the machine.
- No, no, no. I'll-l'll wash them.
- There's no need.
- No, it's no problem.
- It's no problem for me either.
- I'd rather take care of it myself.
- Honestly, it's no problem.
- Really, no!
- Spud, they're my sheets!
- I don't see why not.
- Because it's illegal, that's why not.
- What, holding hands?
- No, not holding hands.
In that case, you can do it. You were
quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Yeah, that's what's illegal. Do you know
what they do to people like me inside?
They cut your balls off
and flush 'em down the fucking toilet.
Calm down.
You're not going to jail.
Oh, well, that's very easy
for you to say, Diane.
- Can I see you again?
- Certainly not.
If you don't see me again,
I'll tell the police.
I'll see you around then.
- Now what?
- We go for a walk.
- What?
- A walk.
- Where?
- There.
Are you serious?
Well, what are you
waiting for?
Hey, Tommy...
this is not natural, man.
It's the great outdoors!
It's fresh air!
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting
a hard time off Lizzy...
but there's really no need
to take it out on us.
Doesn't it make you proud
to be Scottish?
It's shite being Scottish!
We're the lowest
of the low!
The scum of the fucking Earth!
The most wretched, miserable,
servile, pathetic trash...
that was ever shat
into civilization!
Some people hate English.
I don't! They're just wankers!
We, on the other hand,
are colonized by wankers!
Can't even find a decent culture
to be colonized by!
We're ruled by effete arseholes!
It's a shite state of affairs
to be in, Tommy!
And all the fresh air in the world
won't make any fucking difference!
Sorry, man. Sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
Look, I appreciate it, Tommy -
 At or around
this time, Spud, Sick Boy and l...
made a healthy, informed,
democratic decision...
to get back on heroin
as soon as possible.
It took about 12 hours.
It looks easy this, but it's not.
It looks like a doss,
like a soft option.
But living like this
is a full-time business.
 Ursula Andress,
the quintessential Bond girl.
That's what everyone says.
The embodiment, right,
of his superiority to us.
Beautiful, exotic,
highly sexual.
Yet totally unavailable
to anyone apart from him.
Shite. I mean,
let's face it, mate.
She'd shag one punter from Edinburgh,
she'd shag the whole fucking lot of us.
- Well done.
- Yep, I knew he was gonna do that.
 Nightclubbing
We're nightclubbing
- Lizzy's gone, Mark.
She's gone and fucking dumped me.
It was that videotape...
and that lggy Pop business
and all other sorts of shite.
She told me where to go
and no fucking mistake.
I said to her, I said, "Look, is there
any chance of getting back together?"
No way. No fucking way.
Honor Blackman...
a.k.a. Pussy Galore, right?
What a total fucking misnomer.
I mean I would not touch her
with yours.
I want to try it, Mark.
You're always going on about how
it's the ultimate hit and that.
Better than sex.
Come on, man,
I'm a fucking adult.
I can find out for myself.
I've got the money.
Personality.
I mean, that's what counts, right?
Personality. I mean that's what keeps
a relationship going through the years.
Like heroin.
I mean, heroin's got
great fucking personality.
 Nightclubbing
We're nightclubbing
 We're walking through town
 Nightclubbing
We're nightclubbing
Swanney taught us to adore and respect
the National Health Service...
for it was the source
of much of our gear.
We stole drugs.
We stole prescriptions or bought them...
sold them, swapped them,
forged them, photocopied them.
Or traded drugs
with cancer victims...
alcoholics, pensioners, AIDS patients,
epileptics and bored housewives.
We took morphine, diamorphine,
cyclozine, codeine, temazepam...
nitrazepam, phenobarbitone,
and sodium amytal...
dextropropoxyphene, methadone,
nalbuphine, pethidine, pentazocine...
buprenorphine, dextromoramide,
chlormethiazole.
The streets are awash
with drugs you can have...
for unhappiness and pain,
and we took them all.
Fuck it, we would've injected vitamin C
if only they'd made it illegal.
Pardon me, may I use your bathroom?
Thank you.
You're a psycho!
Hey, Rent boy...
no fucking smack.
 But the good times
couldn't last forever.
No! My God, no!
 I think Allison had
been screaming all day...
-but it hadn't really registered before.
- She might have been screaming
for a week for all I knew.
- It had been days
since I'd heard anyone speak.
- Help me!
- Though surely someone must have
said something in all that time.
- Surely to fuck someone must have.
- Allison. Allison!
- Help me, please!
- Hey, calm down!
- Everything'll be just fine.
 Nothing could have
been further from the truth.
- In point of fact,
nothing was gonna be just fine.
- On the contrary,
everything was gonna be bad.
Bad. I mean, everything was gonna be
even worse than it already was.
No! My God!
No! No!
No! My God! No! No!
- Fuck.
 It wasn't my baby.
She wasn't my baby.
Baby Dawn, she wasn't mine.
- Spud's, Swanney's, Sick Boy's?
I don't know.
Maybe Allison knew, maybe not.
I wished I could think
of something to say.
Something sympathetic,
something human.
Say something, Mark.
- Fucking say something, huh?
I'm cooking up.
Cook us up a shot, Rent.
I really need a hit.
And so she did.
I could understand that.
To take the pain away.
So I cooked up,
and she got a hit.
But only after me.
That went without saying.
Well, at least we knew
who the father was now.
- It wasn't just the baby
that died that day.
Something inside Sick Boy
was lost and never returned.
It seemed he had no theory with which to
explain a moment like this, nor did l.
Our only response was to keep
on going and fuck everything.
Pile misery upon misery.
Heap it up on a spoon
and dissolve it with a drop of bile.
Then squirt it into a stinking,
purulent vein and do it all over again.
Keep on going, getting up, going out,
robbing, stealing, fucking people over.
Propelling ourselves with longing
towards the day it would all go wrong.
Because no matter
how much you stash...
or how much you steal,
you never have enough.
No matter how often you go out
and rob and fuck people over...
you always need to get up
and do it all over again.
- Gangway!
 Sooner or later,
this kind of thing was bound to happen.
 Because shoplifting is theft,
which is a crime...
and, despite what you may believe, there
is no such entity as victimless crime.
Heroin addiction may explain your
actions, but it does not excuse them.
Mr. Murphy, you are a habitual thief...
devoid of regret and remorse.
In sentencing you to six months
imprisonment, my only worry is...
that it will not be long
before we meet again.
Mr. Renton, I understand that
you have entered into a program...
of rehabilitation in an attempt
to wean yourself away from heroin.
The suspension
of your sentence...
is conditional on your continued
cooperation with this program.
Should you stand guilty before me again,
I shall not hesitate...
to impose a custodial sentence.
Thank you, Your Honor.
With God's help,
I'll conquer this terrible affliction.
What can you say?
Well, Begbie had a phrase for it.
It was fucking obvious that
that cunt was going to fuck some cunt.
Well, I hope you learned
your lesson, son.
Oh, my son. I thought I was
gonna lose you there.
You're nothin' but trouble to me,
but I still love you.
You'd better clean up your fucking act,
sunshine. Cut that shite out forever.
You listen to Francis, Mark.
He's talking sense, kid.
You're fucking right I am. See, inside,
you wouldn't last two fucking days.
There's better things
than the needle, Rents. Choose life.
I remember
when you were a wee baby.
 Oh, mama's little baby
loves shortening, shortening
 Mama's little baby
loves shortening bread
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Murphy.
It wasn't fair,
Spud going down and not me.
Well, it's not our fault!
Your boy went down because
he was a fucking smack-head!
If that's not your fault,
then I don't know what is!
I was the fucking cunt
that tried to get him off it.
- I'll get the fucking drinks then, eh?
- Aye.
I wished I'd gone down instead of Spud.
Here I was surrounded
by my family and my so-called mates...
and I've never felt so alone.
Never in all my puff.
Since I was on remand,
they've had me on this program.
The state-sponsored addiction.
Three sickly sweet doses of methadone
a day instead of smack.
But it's never enough.
And, at the moment,
it's nowhere near enough.
I took all three this morning...
and now I've got 18 hours to go
'til my next shot...
and the sweat on my back
like a layer of frost.
I need to visit the Mother Superior,
for one hit.
One fucking hit...
to get us over
this long, hard day.
What's on the menu
this evening, sir?
- Your favorite dish.
- Excellent.
- Usual table, sir?
- Why, thank you.
- Would sir care to pay
for his bill in advance?
- No, stick it on my tab.
Ah, regret to inform, sir, credit limit
was reached and breached some time ago.
Oh, well, in that case -
Ah, hard currency. That'll do nicely.
Can't be too careful...
when we're dealing
with your type, can we, sir?
Would sir care for a starter?
Some garlic bread, perhaps?
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly
to the intravenous injection...
- of hard drugs, please.
- As you wish, sir. As you wish.
 Just a perfect day
 Drink sangria in the park
 And then later
 Perhaps sir would
like me to call for a taxi?
 Just a perfect day
- Feed animals in the zoo
 Then later, a movie too
- And then home
 Oh, it's such a perfect day
 I'm glad
I spent it with you
- Oh, such a perfect day
- You just keep me hanging on
 You just keep me hanging on
 Just a perfect day
 Problems are left alone
 Weekenders on our own
 It's such fun
 Just a perfect day
 You made me forget myself
 I thought I was someone else
Someone good
 Oh, it's such a perfect day
 I'm glad I spent it with you
 Oh, such a perfect day
- You just keep me hanging on
- You just keep me hanging on
- Open your eyes! Come on, wake up!
 You're going to reap
just what you sow
 You're going to reap
just what you sow
- You're going to reap
- Just what you sow
 You're going to reap
 Just what you sow
I don't feel the sickness yet,
but it's in the mail, that's for sure.
I'm in the junkie limbo
at the moment.
Too ill to sleep,
too tired to stay awake.
But the sickness is on its way.
Sweat, chills, nausea,
pain and craving.
Need, like nothing else I've ever known,
will soon take hold of me.
It's on its way.
 You've got green eyes
Ooh, you've got blue eyes
 Ooh, you've got gray eyes
 And I've never seen anyone
quite like you
 Before
 No, I never met anyone
quite like you before
We'll help you, son.
You'll stay here with us
'til you get better.
- Gonna beat this together.
- Maybe l -
- Maybe I should go back to the clinic.
- No.
No clinics. No methadone.
That only made you worse.
You said so yourself.
You lied to us, son.
Your own mother...
- and father.
- You could bring us some jellies.
No! You're worse coming off that
than you are with the heroin.
- Nothing at all!
- It's a clean break this time.
You're staying here
where we can keep an eye on you.
I appreciate what you're trying
to do, I really do,
but I just need one more score.
Just bring me one more hit, please.
- I need one more fucking hit!
- You fuck!
Bitch! Bitch!
Well, this is
a good fucking laugh, isn't it?
You sweat that shite
out of your system.
'Cause if I come back
and it's still here...
I'll fucking kick it out.
- Okay?
God.
Question number one:
The human immunodeficiency
virus is a -
- Retrovirus.
- Retrovirus is the right answer!
It's a mug's game, Mrs. Renton.
I mean, I'm not saying I was
blameless myself. Far from it.
But there comes a time when you have to
turn your back on all that nonsense...
and just say no.
- Just say no.
- Oh, my God, she's dead!
No!
- Question number two:
H.I.V. binds to which receptor
on the host lymphocyte?
Which receptor is that?
- CD-4.
- CD-4 is the right answer!
Better than sex, Rents.
Better than sex.
The ultimate hit.
I'm a fucking adult.
I can find out for myself.
Well, I'm finding out, all right.
Tommy.
- No.
Stop it. Dawn, stop it.
Is he guilty or not guilty?
- He's our son.
No! Dawn! Dawn!
Stop! No! Dawn!
Oh, no! Dawn!
No, not me!
- Stop!
- Mark.
- Mark.
Mark.
There's something
you need to do.
Ow.
Come alive, 35.
Box of tricks, 66.
Mark. Mark, you get the house!
- House! House!
For goodness sake, Mark.
 It seems, however,
I am the luckiest guy in the world.
Several years of addiction
right in the middle of an epidemic...
surrounded by the living dead.
But not me. I'm negative.
It's official.
And once the pain goes away,
that's when the real battle starts:
depression, boredom.
You feel so fucking low,
you want to fucking top yourself.
 Tommy!
Tommy!
Tommy, it's Mark, man.
All right, mate?
- Gettin' out much, Tommy?
- No.
Following the game at all?
- No.
Nah, me neither, really.
You take the test?
Aye.
Clear?
Aye.
That's nice.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
- Got any gear on you?
- No, I'm clean, man.
Well...
sub us then, mate.
I'm expecting a rent check.
- Thanks, Mark.
No bother.
 No bother.
None at all. Not for me, anyway.
-Still, it's easy to be philosophical...
when it's some other poor cunt
with shite for blood.
- What do you want?
- Are you clean?
- Yes.
- Is that a promise then?
Yes, it is,
as a matter of fact.
Calm down.
I'm only asking.
- Is that hash I can smell?
- No.
- I wouldn't mind a bit if it is.
- Well, it isn't.
- It smells like it.
- You're too young.
I'm too young for what?
 You're not getting
any younger, Mark.
The world's changing. Music's changing.
Even drugs are changing.
You can't stay in here all day
dreaming about heroin...
- and Ziggy Pop.
- It's lggy Pop.
Whatever.
I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured
last year. Tommy went to see him.
The point is, you've got to find
something new.
 She was right.
I had to find something new.
There was only
one thing for it.
 So find the feelin'
 So find the feelin'
 So find the feelin'
 Bom Digi Digi Digi
Bom Digi Bom
Lifestyle Letting Agency.
Oh, yes, it's a beautifully converted
Victorian town house.
Ideally located on a quiet road
near to the local shops and transport.
Um, this one's two bedrooms
and a kitchen/diner.
Fully fitted,
in excellent decorative order.
Lots of storage space
and all mod cons.
It's going at £320 a week.
 I settled in
not too badly and kept myself to myself.
Sometimes, of course,
I thought about the guys,
but mainly I didn't miss them at all.
After all, this was boomtown,
where any fool could make cash
from chaos, and plenty did.
 Tell you what I've got.
I've got a beautifully converted
Victorian town house.
I quite enjoyed the sound of it all:
profit, loss, margins...
takeovers, lending,
letting, subletting...
subdividing, cheating, scamming,
fragmenting, breaking away.
Who's got the keys
to Telegraph Road?
There was no such thing as society,
and even if there was...
I most certainly
had nothing to do with it.
For the first time in my adult life,
I was almost content.
 Dear Mark, I'm glad
you found a job and somewhere to live.
School is fine at the moment.
I'm not pregnant,
but thanks for asking.
Your friend, Sick Boy, asked me last
week if I would like to work for him...
but I told him where to go.
I met Spud, who sends his regards.
Or at least I think that's what he said.
No one has seen Tommy for ages.
And, finally, Francis Begbie has been
on television a lot this week...
as he is wanted
by the police in connection...
with an armed robbery
in a jeweler's in Corstorphine.
Take care.
Yours with love, Diane.
Francis Begbie.
Oh, no.
Armed robbery?
What, with a replica?
- How the fuck can it be armed
robbery with a fucking replica?
Fucking scandal.
The gear. Look.
Supposed to be fucking solid silver.
It's fucking garbage.
Those young couples investin' all their
fucking hopes in that stuff and all.
- It's a scandal, Franco.
- Too fucking right it is.
How about the wee pot noodles
by the way? I'm fucking Lee Marvin.
Hey, Rents.
Begbie settled in in no time at all.
Fucking find cigarettes.
- We didn't have nowhere to live
- Aye.
- We didn't have nowhere to go
 'Til someone said I know
this place I've been before
 It was on the 15th floor
- It had a bar across the door
 It took an hour to cross it off
and get inside
 It smelled as if
someone had died
 The living room
was full of flies
- The kitchen sink was -
- Begs?
- Ooh, it's a mess all right
- Begs!
- Yes, it's my house
Yeah, the guy's a psycho. But it's true.
He's a mate also.
What can I do?
 I was living in the sky
 I never thought
I'd live so high
 Just like heaven
if it didn't look like hell
 The lift is always
full of piss
 The fifth floor landing
smells of fish
 Not just on Friday
Every single other day
- Hey, pop down to bookie's
and put a line on for us.
- Can you not go yourself?
- I'm serious here.
I'm a fugitive from the law, and I can't
even walk the fuckin' streets.
You go.
Here.
Doncaster.
Four-forty.
Five pound to win.
Bad Boy.
Fucking buy
some fucking beer and all.
 Come on, Bad Boy.
Come on, son. Come on, son.
Come on! Come on!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Bad Boy!
Came in at 16 to 1.
And with the winnings,
we went out to celebrate.
 Diane was right.
The world is changing.
Music is changing.
Drugs are changing.
Even men and women
are changing.
One thousand years from now, there'll be
no guys and no girls, just wankers.
- Sounds great to me.
It's just a pity no one told Begbie.
Fuck! Fuck!
lf you ask me, we're heterosexual
by default not by decision.
It's just a question
of who you fancy.
It's all about aesthetics.
And it's fuck-all to do with morality.
Fuck!
But you try telling Begbie that.
Look, I'm not a fucking buftie,
and that's the end of it.
Let's face it,
it could have been wonderful.
Fucking listen to me,
you piece of junkie shit.
A joke's a fucking joke. You mention
that again, and I'll cut you up.
You understand?
Since I last saw him...
Sick Boy had reinvented himself
as a pimp and a pusher...
and was here, he said,
to mix business and pleasure...
setting up contacts,
as he constantly informed me...
for the great smack deal
that was one day going to make him rich.
Good chips.
I can't believe
you did that.
I got a good price for it.
Rents, I need the money.
It was my fucking telly!
Christ, if I'd known you were
gonna get so humpty about it...
I wouldn't have bothered.
Fucking rented anyway.
Are you gonna eat that?
Have you got a passport?
Why?
I met this bloke.
Runs a hotel, brothel.
Loads of contacts.
Does a nice sideline in punting
British passports to foreigners.
Get you a good price.
And why would I want
to sell my passport?
It was just an idea.
I had to get rid of them.
Sick Boy didn't do his drug deal,
and he didn't get rich.
Instead, he and Begbie just hung around
my bedsit looking for things to steal.
I decided to offer them one of London's
most desirable properties.
- But, of course,
they weren't paying any rent.
So when my boss found
two desperate suckers who would...
Sick Boy and Begbie were bound
to feel threatened.
Yep, lots of storage.
All mod cons, 320 quid a week.
- And that was that.
But by then we had
another reason to go back:
Tommy.
 Tommy knew he'd got the virus,
but he never knew he's gone full blown.
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
No, toxoplasmosis.
It's like a stroke.
How's that?
He wanted to see Lizzy again.
She wouldn't even
let him near the house.
So he bought her a present.
He brought her this kitten.
- But Lizzy told him
where to fucking stick it.
- Exactly.
"l'm not wantin' that cat," she says.
"Get the fuck, right."
So there's Tommy stuck
with this kitten.
- You can imagine what happened.
- To those of us gathered here today...
Thomas McKenzie filled a number
of different roles in our lives.
- Thomas was a son,
a brother and a friend.
- The thing was neglected...
pissing and shitting
all over the place.
- Tommy's lying about fucked out
of his eyeballs...
on smack or downers.
He never knew you could get
toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
 A loving man
who had a great lust for life.
- A keen musician -
- Neither did l. What is it?
- Fucking horrible.
- It's like an abscess on your brain.
- Fucking hell.
- Then what happened?
 He starts getting
these headaches...
- so he just uses more smack,
you know, for the pain.
- Right.
And then he has a stroke.
A fucking stroke, just like that.
Gets home from the hospital
and dies three weeks later.
 He'd been dead
for ages before the neighbors...
complained about the smell and
got the police to break down the door.
- Tommy was lying facedown
in a pool of vomit.
 He has gone from us, but we
have many things to remember him by.
- The kitten was fine.
- Would you all please rise now
for the committal?
 Do you think
I would leave you crying
 When there's room
on my horse for two
 Climb up here, Tommy
Don't be dying
 I can go just as fast
with two
 When we grow up
we'll both be soldiers
 And our horses
will not be toys
 And I wonder
if we'll remember
 When we were
two little boys
- Tommy.
- Tommy.
Did you tell him yet?
- On you go.
- What?
There's this mate of Swanney's.
- You know the guy. Mikey Forrester.
- Aye.
Well... he's come
into some gear.
- A lot of gear.
- How much gear?
About two kilos.
So he tells me.
He got drunk in a pub
down by the docks last week...
where he met
two Russian sailors.
They're fucking carrying the stuff.
For sale there and then, like.
So he wakes up next morning...
realizes what he's done,
gets very fucking nervous.
He wants rid of this, right?
- So?
- So he met me.
And I offered to take it off his hands
at a very reasonable price...
with the intention of punting it
on myself to a guy I know in London.
 We've just come back
from Tommy's funeral...
and you're talking
about a skag deal?
Aye.
What was your price?
- Four grand.
- You haven't got four grand.
- We're 2,000 short.
- Well, that's tough.
Look, Mark, every cunt knows
you've been saving up in London.
- I'm sorry, boys.
I do not have two grand.
 Aye, you fucking do.
I've seen
your bank statement.
- For fuck's sake.
- Two thousand...
one hundred
and thirty-three pound.
Two kilos.
What is that, ten years?
Mikey Forrester. Russian sailors.
What the fuck are you boys on?
Eh? Spud, you've already
been to jail.
What's the deal?
You like it so much you want to go back?
I just want the money, Mark.
If everybody keeps their fucking mouth
shut, there'll be no cunt going to jail.
I hadn't told anyone everything
that was running through my mind...
about what might happen
in London.
There were a lot of possibilities
I didn't want to talk to anyone about.
Ideas best kept to myself.
What no one told me was that
when we bought the smack...
some lucky punter
would have to try it out.
Begbie didn't trust Spud.
Sick Boy was too careful
these days.
So I rolled up my sleeve,
I spiked my vein...
and I did what had to be done.
It's good.
Oh, it's really
fucking good.
Yeah, that hit was good.
I promised myself another one
before we got to London.
Just the one hit.
Just for old time's sake.
Just to piss Begbie off.
This was his nightmare.
The dodgiest scam
in a lifetime of dodgy scams.
Being perpetrated with three of the most
useless and unreliable fuckups in town.
I knew what was going on
in his mind.
Any trouble in London,
and he would dump us immediately.
One way or another,
he had to.
If he got caught
with a bag full of smack...
on top of that armed robbery shit,
he was going down for 15 to 20.
Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he
didn't shite it off 20 years in prison.
This was to be my final hit.
But let's be clear about this.
There's final hits
and final hits.
What kind was this to be?
- Did you bring the cards?
- What?
The cards. The last thing I
told you was to mind the cards.
Well, I've not brought them.
- Fucking boring after
a while without the cards.
- I'm sorry.
- But fucking late, like.
- Why didn't you bring them?
'Cause I fucking told you
to bring them, you doss cunt!
Christ.
These are your friends, right?
These are the guys I told you about.
- Okay.
- Well, is he here?
- Yeah, he's here.
You didn't get followed
or nothing, did you?
- Didn't get followed.
- Okay.
- All right.
- Hi.
 Straight away
he clocked us for what we were:
small-time wasters
with an accidental big deal.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
 So...
how much would you
like for this?
Twenty thousand.
Well, I don't think
it's worth much more than 15.
This was a real drag to him.
He didn't need to negotiate.
I mean, what the fuck were we going
to do with it if he didn't buy it?
Sell it on the streets?
Fuck that.
Well, 19.
Terribly sorry.
I can't go to 19.
Well, fucking 16 then.
Okay.
"Well, fucking 16"
it is then.
 These, gentlemen,
are £2,000 bundles.
That's two.
That's four.
We settled on £16,000.
- Now you have six.
He had a lot more in the suitcase,
like, but it was better than nothing.
And two more make eight.
Thank you very much,
gentlemen.
- I'd just like to say,
it's been a pleasure haggling with you.
- Fucking better be.
Okay?
Yes!
- Fucking -
 And just
for a moment, it felt really great.
Like we were all in it together,
like friends. Like it meant something.
- A moment like that
can touch you deep inside.
But it doesn't last long.
Not like £16,000.
So what about you, Spud? Any major
investments on the horizon at all?
- Gonna buy yourself
a wee island in the sun?
- For four grand?
One palm tree, a couple of rocks
and a fucking sewage outflow.
I don't know, man. I'm gonna
get something for my ma, I think.
Get some good speed.
No bicarb.
- Then get a girl,
take her out, treat her right.
- And shag her senseless.
No, man!
True love. True love.
Eh, but I could really handle
some hot sex...
- with a Jewish princess!
- You daft cunt!
- Or a Catholic!
- If you're gonna waste it on a bird...
you might as well fucking
leave it all to me.
- Get our drinks.
- I got a round already.
- I got the last ones.
- It's your round, Franco.
Okay. Same again?
Right. I'm off for a piss.
See when I get back
the money's still here, okay?
The moment your back's turned,
we're out the door.
Yeah, I'll be right
fucking after you.
You'll never catch us,
you flabby bastard.
By the way,
see you when I get back.
Be halfway down the street
with the money.
- I'd fucking kill you.
- Aye, I thought you might, Franco.
Thought you might.
Are you game for it?
What?
Well?
Are you serious?
Don't know. Don't know.
What do you think?
Still here, I see.
- Aye. Well, we wouldn't
run out on a mate, eh?
- Why not? I know I would.
Where's Franco?
For fuck's sake!
Sorry, mate.
I'll buy you another one.
You've ruined my fucking suit,
you fucking idiot!
 Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.
Sorry's not going to dry me off,
you cunt.
Cool down, Franco.
The man says he's sorry.
He's sorry enough
for being a fat cunt.
Fuck you. If you can't hold a pint, you
shouldn't be in the pub, mate. Fuck off.
Oh, no!
No, Franco, don't do it, man.
- For fuck's sake!
- Fucking nice one, Franco!
- Shut it.
- You cut me, man!
- You were in my fucking way.
Anybody else want to get
in my fucking way? You?
You?
Hey, Rent boy...
you bring me down
a fucking smoke.
- I think
we'd better go, Franco!
- I've got to go to the hospital!
You're not going to any fucking
hospital, and you're staying there!
You bring me down
a fucking cigarette.
And the bag.
 Now I've justified
this to myself in all sorts of ways.
It wasn't a big deal,
just a minor betrayal.
Or we'd outgrown each other.
You know, that sort of thing.
But let's face it.
I ripped them off.
My so-called mates.
But Begbie -
I couldn't give a shit about him.
And Sick Boy. He'd have done the same
to me, if he'd only thought of it first.
And Spud - Well, okay, I felt sorry
for Spud. He never hurt anybody.
 Bastard!
 Bastard!
- Open up. Open up now!
Bastard!
Bastard!
So why did I do it?
I could offer
a million answers, all false.
The truth is
that I'm a bad person.
But that's gonna change.
I'm going to change.
This is the last
of that sort of thing.
Now I'm cleaning up,
and I'm moving on.
Going straight
and choosing life.
I'm looking forward
to it already.
I'm gonna be just like you.
The job, the family,
the fucking big television...
the washing machine,
the car, the compact disc
and electrical tin opener...
good health, low cholesterol,
dental insurance...
mortgage, starter home,
leisure wear, luggage...
three-piece suite, D.I.Y.,
game shows, junk food, children...
walks in the park,
nine-to-five, good at golf...
washing the car, choice of sweaters,
family Christmas...
indexed pension, tax exemption,
clearing gutters...
getting by, looking ahead,
the day you die.
