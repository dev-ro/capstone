This is a true story.
I've toId it as it happened,
unadorned.
Here, under German occupation,
10,000 men suffered
at the hands of the Nazis.
7,000 died.
A MAN ESCAPED
OR
THE WIND BLO WETH
WHERE IT LISTETH
I couId feeI
I was being watched.
I didn't dare move.
Nothing broken,
but I wasn't a pretty sight.
I cIeaned myseIf up.
The charges against me
were so heavy,
and I'd aggravated them so.
Why didn't they shoot me?
In the courtyard,
I got used to the idea of dying.
I wouId have preferred
immediate execution.
My neighbor's knocking
was of no heIp.
My courage abandoned me
for a moment, and I cried.
I sIept so soundIy
the guards had to wake me up.
Get up!
InstinctiveIy,
I pretended to be too weak.
I made enormous efforts
just to sit up.
Did that IittIe trick
save my Iife?
They threw me back,
and I was aIone again.
My ceII was Iess
than 3 meters by 2.
It was furnished sparseIy:
a wooden frame with a mattress,
two bIankets.
In a recess by the door,
a sanitary paiI.
And set in the waII,
a stone sheIf.
This sheIf enabIed me
to reach the window.
In the courtyard
in front of me...
three men,
weII dressed and cIean shaven,
circuIated freeIy.
Be carefuI.
I'II be back.
- Your name?
- Fontaine.
I'm Terry.
Can I get messages out?
I know a way.
I knew I had to be wary.
Catch this.
Because a stranger
''knew a way''
everything had aIready
changed for me.
Despite the handcuffs,
I managed to wash my face
and wounds.
I was soon abIe to communicate
with my neighbor.
A young bIacksmith,
he kiIIed a German
during a brawI.
He was awaiting
the firing squad.
He was 19.
With his string
and my handkerchief,
I made a sort of sack.
Give me your Ietters tomorrow.
To give my famiIy hopes
I myseIf didn't have...
but mainIy to warn my Ieaders
that the transmitter I was using
was heIping the Germans,
who had broken our code.
I decided to run the risk.
And what a risk!
Giving Ietters to a stranger
was putting myseIf and my group
in great danger.
We couId have been seen
or taken by surprise.
Do you have a pin?
A pin?
Wait.
He went towards
the women's barracks.
A gift from them.
On the paper,
written by a woman,
the word ''Courage.''
There was aIso the pin.
My neighbor had expIained how,
but it took a whiIe.
I didn't think it possibIe.
I stretched my arms
and my sore wrists.
I feIt a sudden sense
of victory.
As a speciaI favor,
the head guard aIIowed Terry
to see his daughter.
I Iearned this much Iater.
I had no idea of the risks
he and his daughter
were running.
Once back home, she stamped
and posted the Ietters.
Your Ietters Ieft yesterday.
They'II arrive today.
Thank you.
You've done your duty.
That shouId heIp you make it.
Look!
Be carefuI.
So, Lieutenant Fontaine.
Have you accepted your faiIure?
Let me be frank.
I'd have jumped
from the car too.
Now promise me
you'II no Ionger try to escape.
I promise.
What was this game?
He obviousIy didn't beIieve me.
As for me, I decided to escape
as soon as possibIe.
Did he expect to see me
jumping at my grub?
My first meaI in four days.
I spent more and more time
at the window.
I studied the courtyard,
the waIIs, and the infirmary.
UnconsciousIy,
I was getting ready.
I knew that executions
took pIace within the prison.
A terribIe thought
crossed my mind.
He was there.
I spent the day tapping
the BattaIion Song
which he'd asked to Iearn.
That was aII the heIp
I couId give him.
The next day,
the head guard came for me.
Jacket.
ToweI.
I Ieft the first fIoor
for ceII 107 on the top fIoor.
On my right, no one.
An empty ceII.
On my Ieft, a neighbor
who didn't answer my tapping.
I stared at their faces,
to see what they were Iike.
I aIso stared at the waIIs.
Newcomer?
I was downstairs
for 15 days...
or 15 years!
You get used to it.
Take it from me.
My name is Hebrard.
No taIking!
Mine is Fontaine.
After emptying our paiIs
and washing our faces,
we'd go back to our ceIIs
for another 24 hours.
Nothing to do, no news,
Iiving in terrifying soIitude,
we were a hundred or so
awaiting our fate.
I had no doubt about mine.
To escape.
To fIee.
Luck and idIeness
gave me my first chance.
I often sat facing my door,
with nothing to do
besides staring at it.
It was made of two paneIs
of six oak boards,
set in frames equaIIy thick.
In a crack between two boards
I saw that the wood joining them
wasn't oak.
It was another coIor:
beechwood, or popIar.
There was definiteIy a way
of taking apart this door.
I needed an iron spoon.
Pewter and aIuminum
were too soft.
I had to wait out
severaI meaIs.
I made a kind of chiseI.
No, the boards weren't attached
by mortise-and-tenon joints
in the same oak,
but by strips of soft wood
that my tooI couId pick away at.
I figured I wouId need
4 or 5 days
to dig through one strip,
by cutting or chipping away
the wood.
But each evening
at the same time,
I had to get some air.
I couIdn't work fast,
because of the noise I made
and the constant fear
of being caught.
I kept having
to sweep under the door
with a piece of straw
from my broom.
Fontaine, are you there?
Is that you, Terry?
At Iast. I missed you.
I'm Ieaving.
They're Ietting you go?
They're taking me
God knows where.
How did he avoid the guards
and get to my ceII?
I never knew.
My neighbor downstairs?
Shot two days ago.
FareweII.
Terry's departure,
and the death
of that unseen friend,
Ieft me in despair.
I kept on working.
It stopped me from thinking.
I had to open this door.
I had no other pIans.
A new inmate,
Pastor de Leyris,
took on my trust
and my need for friendship.
They arrested me at my puIpit.
I couIdn't take anything.
Nothing?
I used to dream of being aIone
someday with my BibIe...
I don't have a BibIe,
but I have a penciI.
That's pIenty.
You have to keep busy...
write, try staying sane.
I do.
Three boards
wouId give me room enough.
Facing me,
someone kept guard.
It made my job a Iot easier.
But my neighbor's siIence
troubIed me.
We can taIk.
They're aII downstairs.
Are you scared?
I knew he was there.
I was sure of it.
He scared me so much,
I no Ionger dared touch my door.
I pIugged up the hoIes
with paper
I'd soiIed on the fIoor.
He Iooked at us, distraught.
That evening at the window,
BIanchet...
that was his name...
DoIIars, Mr. BIanchet?
DoIIars beIonging to you?
No, to a Jewish Iady.
I'd never seen her before.
She gave them to me
the day she was captured.
How did they find out?
A Ietter in a piIe of Iaundry.
They'II Iet you go.
No.
What can I do for you?
Nothing.
There must be something.
If you want to heIp me,
stop scratching.
You'II get the whoIe fIoor
punished.
After three weeks,
working as quietIy as possibIe,
I was abIe to separate,
Iengthwise, three boards.
But they were stiII
in the frame,
fastened by joints
which bent my spoon.
To disIodge them from the frame
I needed another spoon.
OnIy then couId I force them
hard enough.
The BibIe?
I'm Iucky.
A miracIe!
Since yesterday,
everything is different.
SiIence! No taIking!
I'm Iucky too.
I busted the frame,
but more than I'd intended.
I was abIe to put the piece
back in pIace.
Why do it?
To fight.
Fight against the waIIs,
against myseIf, my door.
Mr. BIanchet,
you shouId fight too.
And hope...
Hope what?
To go home. To be free.
Free?
Someone's waiting for you...
No one.
A friend?
I have no friends.
Fight anyway.
Fight for everyone here.
Watching onIy after yourseIf...
What do you do, then?
I watch you.
And that gives me courage.
If I had courage,
I'd kiII myseIf.
I tried.
I made a noose with my shoeIace.
The naiI feII.
So?
I heard someone knocking.
It was me.
Why didn't you answer?
Why?
I was afraid that someone
wouId open or cIose my door
vioIentIy.
FortunateIy,
I handIed it myseIf.
- How are you?
- Fine.
His wife denounced him,
betrayed him.
Things Iike that happen...
In Iife.
How repuIsive.
Her Iife isn't worth much.
He didn't kiII her?
AImost.
We thought he'd go crazy.
Now he's another man.
His face no Ionger knows
hatred or suffering.
His name is Orsini.
TaIking about me, Father?
I said you are courage
incarnate.
After one month's work
my door was open.
What took a Iot of time
was putting it back in pIace.
Inside, no rounds, no guards.
There was nothing speciaI
about roaming the corridor.
But I had a goaI.
No food and exercise.
What is it?
It's me. CeII 107.
ImpossibIe.
HoId out.
If I have to,
I'II come back tomorrow.
His astonishment
made me happy.
That night,
I feII asIeep Iess unhappy.
It was you in the corridor.
Don't Iie.
It was me.
You'II Ieave.
How wiII you do it?
I have absoIuteIy no idea.
The head guard and the Sergeant
sIept on the second fIoor.
The CorporaI
on the first fIoor,
near the door
to which he had the key.
This door remained Iocked
at night.
I considered
every possibIe aIternative,
and even impossibIe ones.
I made a thousand pIans.
None was good.
Read and pray.
God wiII save you.
OnIy if we give him a hand.
You never pray?
Sometimes.
When things are bad?
That's easy.
Too easy.
It wouId be too easy
if God handIed everything.
You're the onIy one here
to think of escaping.
The onIy one,
because it's impossibIe.
Take me.
You won't make it.
I have to.
The miIitary caII it
a reconnaissance mission.
Be carefuI.
If at 10 o'cIock,
I'm not in the corridor...
At 10 o'cIock,
I was under the skyIight.
I feared the worst.
The pIan for Ieaving the prison
and how to dismantIe your door.
Read it and tear it up.
Trust me,
but I'm not ''courage incarnate.''
If you can forgive and forget...
I think about it,
but it's as if it happened
to someone eIse.
Trust me.
It wiII work.
TweIve meters of rope
strong enough to support a man.
That's what I needed.
The netting of the bedstead
provided me with 40 meters
of strong wire.
I made my first piece of rope
with the boIster.
I stuffed its horsehair
into the mattress.
I foIded the cIoth in quarters,
the borders inside,
to avoid fraying.
I twisted it hard.
Wrapping wire
in the opposite direction
Iet me keep the cIoth twisted.
Your door?
I'II try again.
Try, Orsini.
Try again.
Tomorrow I'II teII you
if we spIit up or not.
What's wrong?
Too Iong, too compIicated.
AII of it.
It's the onIy way.
There's another.
Say it.
During our waIk,
with two ropes and two hooks.
What hooks?
He didn't say.
And the guards doing rounds?
He waits tiII they pass.
Where?
On the roof.
He cIimbs up the drainpipe
and hides.
In broad dayIight,
they'II spot him.
His pIan is no good.
The next day,
I couIdn't taIk to Orsini.
He was taken in
for questioning.
So, the questioning?
They reassure us, threaten us...
You know their tactics.
Orsini is happy.
- How is everything?
- Fine.
You have to keep caIm.
- Are you giving up?
- They're freeing me.
- Do you beIieve them?
- Yes.
You're right to.
Orsini!
I was so cIoseIy watched
for 8 days,
we Iost contact.
What was he up to?
I didn't understand.
