- Hey, cut the crap.
He's going home...
Sing one for him.
Something special...
A special tune you say...
Yes, go for it.
Chains and fire all around,
God, bring the doors down to the ground.

Let us all run free, no chains.
May the guards all go to hell.

You want to hit me?
Get your hands om me!
Come on, hit me!
Come on, sucker, hit me.
Are you afraid to hit me?
Hit me!
Are you afraid

You're afraid they won't set you free?
Are you?
You're afraid you're going to rot in jail?
Say it!
- Come on, hit him back!
- He doesn't have the balls.
From now on, you do
only what l tell you to do, got it?
lf you don't, l'll blow you
and your dumb buddy right here
for all to see.
Do you hear me?
l'm talking to you, get it?
Get the fuck out of here!
From now on, he is my slave.
lf anyone wants to spit on his face,
go ahead!
Cluck! Cluck! Cluck!
Do you know what l'm gonna do
when l'll be free?
l'll get out of here and l'll marry
that girl with beautiful lips...
And l'll pick her up from work
and we'll fuck right there in the car...
And we'll fuck, on and on and on...
We'll fuck our brains out man...
What are you doing?
Hurry up! He's getting away!
Fucking son of a bitch!
- How are you, my boy?
- Hi, mom!
How are you?
l'm good.
Sit down.
You've grown so much!
l ate my veggies.
l brought you some cigarettes,
Marius told me you needed some.
Thanks.
How are you?
l'm OK. When did you come back?
A few days ago, but l won't stay long,
l'm leaving the day after tomorrow.
l have to go back to work.
- My baby...
- What work is that?
l work in a hotel, as a receptionist.
l wanted to ask you
to let Marius stay here.
He is not fit for work
and he has to finish school.
You shouldn't carry him around with you,
like you did to me.
l'm not doing so bad over there...
l want to take him with me
and when you'll be free,
you can come as well.
l'll never come to you.
Why?
You came here
to get on my nerves, or what?
Why are you talking to me like that?
What do you mean?
For eight years you...
l talked to your father in hospital
and he signed the papers
to let him come with me.
You'll never ever take him away
with you!
You won't take him away
because l raised him.
For 8 years you didn't care about us,
and now you come to take him away?
You're feeling lonely, right?
You should have taken care of him.
Don't you talk to me like that.
- What do you mean?
- l'm your mother. Yours and his.
What are you?
Come again. What are you?
You've never been a mother to me.
When l was there with you, you sent me
home because l was getting in your way.
Now you want your family back, right?
She came back because
she's all alone there...
She's lonely like shit,
that's why she came back.
Am l right?
Things aren't exactly like that...
Really?
You took me with you
and when you found a new guy,
you got rid of me and sent me home,
like a luggage.
ls it true or not?
And then you came back
and took me with you again
until you found a new guy,
and you sent me home again,
like l was nothing but a bag of shit.
ls this what you want to do with him?
You want to destroy his future
just like you did with me.
This is what you want to do to him.
Because you are a fucking whore.
Your mother is a whore!
You stupid con! Don't you talk to me
like that!
Lady, please.
l didn't come here
to have you talk to me like that.
Why do you hit me?
Do you want to know why?
Because l'm your mother, that's why.
Don't you dare hit me again,
because it was you who destroyed me!
Sit down...
l walked the streets
like a fucking nut,
because l didn't know what else to do.
And now you're coming back
and you hit me
after 8 fucking years?
And you want to take him away?
l'll break your fucking neck!
Shut up, shut up!
Stop hitting me!
Calm down.
Get your hands om me!
You stupid con!
- Leave me alone.
- Sit down!
Who do you think you are to hit me?
You know who l am?
l'm your mother, do you understand?
- Stop yelling!
- Fucking whore!
lf you're not home
when l get there,
l'll fucking kill you all, got it?
lf you're not there when l get home,
l'll destroy you all!
Stop shouting at him!
Shut the fuck up or l'll kill you!
You fucking destroyed me!
- Did you hear what l told you?
- Yes.
- Don't you leave with her!
- Sure...
Take your fucking cigarettes
with you!
- l have to see the warden.
- He's out in the camp.
Sir, have you seen warden?
He went to the dormitories.
Have you seen warden?
l haven't seen
your fucking warden.
- You saw him, guys?
- No.
Have you seen warden?
You want to rat us out?
Just tell me if you've seen him.
Why?
Just tell me if you've seen him.
Rat...
Warden! Sir!
l've got something
very important to ask you.
What is it Chiscan?
l'll be released on the 1Tth,
and l was wondering
if l could go on a leave, for...
For one day, sir...
l need to go home for one day.
How come?
Could you?
l can't let you go on a leave.
Once you've been examined
by the Committee
you're not allowed to go on leave.
- Where do you want to go?
- Home.
Won't you go home
when you'll be released?
Yes, but l really have to go now.
Please, sir...
Wait a couple more days.
Please sir, l really have to go.
l gave you one finger and now
you want to grab my whole hand.
l'm begging you sir.
Godson...
Hey Godson...

l really need to make a call.
Get out of here.

You lame ass.
What do you want?
What's up my man?
Hey.
You're OK? Tell me...
You're a real sucker.
How come you got so low?
Tell me.
Godson told me you woke him up
Iast night because you needed the phone.
Yes.

Who do you think you are?
You're a cocksucker, how come

Wait a bit.
You owe me T packs of cigarettes...

- Older or younger?
- Younger.
- Do you want a cigarette?
- No, thank you.
Where are your parents?
My father is in hospital.
ls he sick?
l don't know.
What do you want from me?
l read your quiz and you did good...
Your writing skills are good.
Why did you read my quiz?
lt's OK, l'll put is aside.
Let's forget about the quiz.
l don't want anyone else reading it.
You can refuse to be interviewed
but since you've took the quiz...
Sit down!
You can kiss your freedom goodbye.

Here, home...
What are you going to do?
Tell me!

You'll stay here
and make his life miserable?

Now tell him to get out of the car.
And leave the engine running!
Get over here!
Get Bear over here!
You take the shard,
