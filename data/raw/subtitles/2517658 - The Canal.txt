Hey... That's my way.
I had a very strange day today.
Saw a film of 1902,
our house was in it.
There was a murder here. A man...
killed his wife.
It happened in this room.

I would not worry about that.
Horrible things happen in every old house.
Only these dinosaurs govern their...

And she has been out all night
before?
No.
No, never.
Said he'd be working until

coworker of Hersand and said...
Alice was about five.
Did you have an argument?
No.
Are you sure?
Yes
Have you been in touch
with family and friends?
Yes
And have not heard of it?

I told you... will be in
home soon. Do not worry.
Pretty...
- Hello.
- Hi.
Is there any news?
How is Billy?
Yeah, okay.
I got to bed an hour ago.
He wanted to sleep in her room.
You know there's something black in his hands?
They took my fingerprints digital to eliminate me.
In case there is an inquiry.
Eh... I stuck
Billy in bed an hour ago.
He wanted to sleep in her room.
He's fine. All day.
We get along great!
He's a great guy, I really sympathize
.
Get to know everything about dinosaurs!
I know, yes!
Me I better go.
Yes
Thanks.
Yes
See you in the morning.
Si.
Billy... Billy! What are you looking at?
Come here...
I had a dream about Mommy.
I miss.
A man came yesterday saying
be the lover of his wife.
Says
was with her the night she disappeared.
They have been going out together for a year.
Do you know anything about that?
No.
Well, according to him,
was planning to leave.
That's impossible.
She loves me.
Has a lover, David.
He's lying!
Well, several of its
friends have supported him.
In what counts, was
love with the guy, and he with her.
Sorry.
Cursed acid reflux.
Total fucking pain in the ass.
Want one of these?
No.
I have a very weak stomach, David.
Not kill her, right?
No right to be
wondering these things.
I love, love my wife.
Never
I never do anything to hurt her.
Never.
Le asking your lover
these questions, right?
Yes
Do you ask him if he killed her?
Yes
He has an alibi.
Your boss called right as he left his house,
listened both insisting on going home alone...
and then the phone went on
for...
Over an hour, so
that is solid, man!
People always suspect the husband.
Do you know why that is?
Because it's always the husband.
Every damn time.
Is this your wife?
Is this your wife, Alice Williams?
Yes
Yes, it's my wife.
There was no evidence of foul play or assault
.
Drowned.
Must have been dropped.
Was it an accident?
Yes
Think so.
One of the heel of his shoe party
it would,
That we think could have caused his downfall.
So, the absence of any evidence to the contrary
,
we have to conclude that it was an accident
yes.
Do you agree?
Did you know she was pregnant?

Therefore entrust your body to the ground
Earth to earth
Ashes to Ashes </ i. >
Dust to Dust
Sorry for your loss.
Thanks.
Nana.
She loved you.
You knew, right?
Yes?
She loved you.
More than any other thing in the world.
Yes
Oh Billy!
Billy.
Come, go with Clare, okay?
How are you?
Yeah, okay.
Children are strong.
They are stronger than most adults
even.
Of course, they do not really understand
, right?
Maybe I should take him for a while.
It might be good for him.
I think Alice would have liked that.
He should be around another woman.
A mother figure.
Sophie living with us now...
The nanny Billy...
I think it's best if
stays home with me.
Did you hear about Alex?
Alex?
Alice's boyfriend.
Apparently, he has taken
Alice's death very badly.
He is completely devastated.
Say he had to go to a hospital.
To recover.
Yes
I give a shit.
Do you understand me?
No
I could care less, I have my son.
Many people loved her.
I loved her.
I have to go.
I only say goodbye to Billy.
Been a long day.
Are you okay?
Lied.
I, uh, I lied to the police.
I know this Alex guy.
Actually
does not matter now anyway, right?
Was an accident.
The thing is...
on the night she disappeared.
I went to his house,
like that, and went after them...
and saw them in bed together.
I did nothing.
Know, I could have done,
but I did not. I just went.
Not even see me.
On the way home I felt...
so sick
just had to go to the public baths...
canal side and
vomited everywhere,
and remember,
I was feeling sick, and I looked up,
and someone
looking over the cubicle wall to me.
Was a man.
I managed to get to the
door, and just before I passed out.
Swear I saw him with his hands around her throat
,
and he was, he was trying to kill
.
He was killing her, and could not
move, could do nothing.
And then when he did not return
home the next day...
I mean, I've seen
was real... Clare...
was very real.
So you have to tell the police
.
Tell them that what
I said, do not even know,
not even know how the guy looked.
No matter, tell them anyway...
Once you tell them
followed Alice into that house, that would be it.
Okay?
They, they just, they just
thought it was me.
What are you going to do?
I have to find him first.
As I have that.

I think it would be good for Billy.
What do you think?
I could buy more lights for the stars.
And yes, I thought I could decorate
all the other rooms and stuff...
do, like, very Christmassy.
Yes
Yes That sounds a good idea..
Okay?
Yes, I'm fine.

I can not hear anything.
No, he stopped.
There's something behind there.
Maybe it's just a rat.
No, no.
It's not a rat.
I can not hear anything.
What can you hear?
Is someone whispering as if in prayer.
Maybe it's just the house next door.
I do not know...
no, no, no, the walls are very solid.
Dad, what are you doing? He slept.
Billy...
Billy, go to bed.
Okay.
's Nothing.
All is well.
Take him to bed, you do.
Come.
We have to go to bed.

Billy, go to your room, get dressed.
You and Sophie will go from here.
I'll just wrap the belt.
That is.
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
I love you.
I'm not sure about this.
Sophie, sorry for this.
You're just going to have to trust me

Did you see its outline?
Hard to say,
could be just a shadow.
Oh come on, there's someone there.
Maybe. It's really hard to say.
Tell me what you think about this?
Believe what?
This is the man who killed Alice.
This is the same man who
saw on the night he was killed.
What do you mean?
I think there are ghosts in my house.
David...!
I know this sounds crazy, believe me, I know how fucking
crazy this sounds,
but I've seen things, I hear things,
is the only rational explanation.
- I do not think so!
- Yes it is!
Okay, okay,
wait until you hear this.
In the 1930s seances were carried out at home
,
people said they saw a shadow, a shadow.
Is it a coincidence, that's all.
The previous owner,
way, the Realtor...
said it was an old woman who was senile
,
but was not.
We lied.
Was a young woman who tried
burn his house while his family slept.
Now his son died in the fire,
but swore that he did not.
Like me with Alice.
Said it was the devil.
Said a man who could not see
, tried to rape her.
Said he was a demon
living behind walls.
The walls, Clare.
Stop for a moment.
Stop for a moment.
Could you
think what you're saying?
Think I'm having a nervous breakdown is not it?

Can I continue?

Now no one can enter without us knowing.
You like me
What about all the dust, Dave?
Meal is cooking.
Do not tell me?
What about all the flour,
're making a cake?
What do you want?
Dress.
You come with me.
Found a hammer in the channel,
with your fingerprints on it.
A hammer that belonged to loving your wife.
He says he was lost, the
night she disappeared.
Can you explain that?
There was a murder in my house...
in 1902.
What...?
You can check all this;
And a man killed his entire family.
You understand me...
and I think he was the one who did it.
I have evidence, I caught something on film
.
's A ghost.
We will see in a few days.
As welfare official
senior, I have...
choice but to recommend appropriate to Services...
Social and recommend that the child is taken care.
Is not that a little harsh?
Mr. Williams has just lost his wife.
Its symptoms are clearly part of a process of mourning.
Enclose nannies in closets and hearing voices...?
Behind walls, is
part of the grieving process?
It was just a nanny and
people react...
differently to the death of a loved one...
and, incidentally, is the same nanny
Mr. . Williams...
caught smoking drugs in his room, so...
No way!
Yes
Yes, we can do that.
Wait to return
psychiatrist's report...
and then we'll see what
do after that.
I will not go to a psychiatrist.
There's nothing wrong with me.
You have to.
We agreed on that.
What you were. I do not.
I will not go.
I have to go back to Billy.
Dad...
Who are these men?
Are the police.
Do not look.
Is there anybody out?
No.
Dad...
What?
Never leave me, right?
No. Of course not.
What if you die as
Mommy, what would become of me then?
Never leave you, Billy.
Never.
And always be together, you and me.
Okay?
Now, close your eyes.
REVENGE VIL

Do you want to see me?
I'm afraid to look for myself.
Okay.

Last night? No.

You were delirious, I hardly recognized your voice.
You were crying.
