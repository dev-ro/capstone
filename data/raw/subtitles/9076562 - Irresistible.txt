CHRIS WALLACE: Good evening.
I welcome you to the third
and final of the 2016
presidential debates.
DONALD TRUMP: We either have
a country, or we don't.
HILLARY CLINTON: Rounding up
people who are undocumented...
TRUMP:
We have some bad hombres here.
CLINTON: ...is an idea
that is not in keeping
- with who we are as a nation.
- TRUMP: I tell it like it is.
CLINTON: I'm happy to compare
my 30 years of experience...
TRUMP:
The one thing you have
over me is experience,
but it's bad experience.
We are going to make
America great again,
and it has to start now.
CLINTON: I hope you will
give me a chance
to serve as your president.
FAITH: Donald Trump
told the American people
the truth tonight,
as he always does.
GARY: Hillary Clinton
is the real outsider.
Look, whatever you think
you saw tonight...
You didn't.
You actually saw what I saw,
and I think that
the American people...
Would agree with me.
As long as I say it
repeatedly, doggedly...
And with unearned confidence.
I lie.
I am lying to you.
And you know I lie.
I'm actually in this position
because of how effectively
I lie to you.
Are we clear?
We call this the spin room,
without shame.
Spinning is something you do
to disorient people.
And you all know that,
and yet here we are.
What a wonderful play
we're putting on.
Thank you all so much.
And fuck you, America.
I look forward to lying to you
in the future.
See you at the bar.

- Thank you.

Shockwaves across America.
NORAH O'DONNELL:

defied preelection polling.
JOHN HEILEMANN:
Tectonic-plate-shifting,
9.5 on the Richter scale

JOE SCARBOROUGH:
So that's just a snapshot
of the reaction
we're getting this morning.
And we're still trying to get
our good old pal Gary Zimmer
to talk to us.
MIKA BRZEZINSKI: He's probably
halfway to Canada by now.
SCARBOROUGH: Yeah,
maybe halfway to Canadian Club.
I'd love to ask this guy
what the hell he was thinking.
How did they blow
this election?
- (Brzezinski chuckles)
- Hey, guys, did you find the clip?
You got it? Okay.
This is our good friend
Gary Zimmer,
grand old consigliere
of the Clinton campaign,
not even a week ago
on this program.
- (whooshing sound effect)
- So, you're confident?
GARY (recorded):
Oh, no question.
Hillary's made her case.
She is the most qualified
presidential candidate,
certainly in my lifetime,
maybe ever.
BRZEZINSKI: Donald Trump
will not be president.
GARY: Well, he is
doing well in the South,
so maybe he can be president
of the Confederacy.
BRZEZINSKI: But Ohio,
Michigan, Pennsylvania.
GARY: Mika, he's not winning
Pennsylvania.
He's not winning Michigan.
That rust belt blue wall
is impenetrable. It holds.
(Southern accent):
I guarantee.
BRZEZINSKI:
Well, you decided to spend
almost no time there
campaigning.
SCARBOROUGH:
Was that a Carville impression?
- (Brzezinski chuckles)
- All right, so wait a minute.
- Tommy, try Gary again.

SCARBOROUGH: Okay, we have

MAYOR BRAUN: So, if there is
no further discussion,
can I get a motion to vote
on Resolution 1217,
requiring a valid
Wisconsin driver's license
or proof of U.S. citizenship
to qualify
for any state or municipality
program or benefit,
such as food stamps, welfare
and so on and so forth.
PIETKOWSKI:
So moved.
- Second?
- MAN: Second.
I have a second.
It is time...
- Excuse me, fellas.
- Jack, I already told you,
you can widen that easement
on Hamburg...
Um, actually, it's about
that resolution
you're thinking about passing.
With all due respect, Colonel,
that discussion has ended.
Yeah, yeah. So I heard.
But, uh...
the thing is that, um...
it's a bad idea.
- Y-You can't...
- Uh, okay, well,
I already seconded,
but whatever.
JACK: I know we're in
a bad spot, but...
you can't bring it back
by throwing these people
under the bus.
Whoa, we're not throwing
anybody under anything, Jack.
(sighs)
Money was tight
when the base was still open,
but now...
I mean, we just
got to be smart.
We got to eliminate
cheating the programs.
There's not a damn soul
using those programs
that doesn't need 'em,
and you know it.
And all they need to do
is produce the acceptable I.D.,
and the benefits will be...
And you know
they can't do that.
Well... (sighs)
I don't make the rules, Jack.
I mean, I do, I guess.
Not by myself, but...
this is over.
(grunts)
BRAUN: Okay, we have a motion
that has been seconded.
It is time to bring it
to a vote.
Uh, you know, uh,
just curious...
you know,
when the river backed up
and the folks
you think might be cheating
stood shoulder to shoulder
with us
stuffing sandbags
for three days straight,
ended up saving your store,
you check their I.D.'s then?
BRAUN:
Discussion's closed, Jack.
You checking I.D.'s
when they're bringing food
- to the church potlucks, Walt?
- (gavel slamming)
Enough, Jack.
You had your say.

bad people.
I'm not saying
you're a bad person, Billy.
I'm saying you're scared.

I get on a plane,
and I go to Wisconsin,
and I use this guy
to road-test a more
rural-friendly message.
It's a mayoral race...
in the middle of nowhere.
Uh, I don't get
how this helps us.
There are two million rural
votes in these states alone.
If we lost them 2.7 to one
instead of three to one,
we'd win,
but we didn't even try.
Their base turned out.
Ours didn't.
If we find a candidate
to activate our base...
if our African Americans
(heavily accented):
and Latino communities...
It's just "Latino."
...show up, we win.
We have to get the rural voters
back into the tent,
even just a little bit.
Well, if it's all
the same to you,
I'll stick with pandering
to our special-interest groups,
thank you very much.

Thank you for coming.
Could we quiet the cows,
please?!
Thank you!
Ladies and gentlemen,
Colonel Jack Hastings.
So, uh,
I am Colonel Jack Hastings,
and...
I'm running for mayor.
So, uh...
How we doing?
All right.
Beautifully put.
Are there any questions
for the Colonel?
Anyone?
Bueller?
Uh, yes, Colonel.
Yes, name and affiliation,
please.
- It's Dan.
- Name and affiliation, please.
I'm Dan.
Go ahead, Daniel.
Easy on the cows!
Um, yes, Mr. Hastings,
uh, Colonel,
could you say that again?
Because I-I don't think
my recorder was on.
Mm. Do it again?
GARY:
Hey, you know what?
It's okay.
- GARY: Now...
- We'll get it.
GARY:
Okay, this one...
What I'm looking for...
don't put all the black ones
in the center.
He's running as a moderate,
okay?
And if you could get some
facing this way,
that would be helpful.
More local news tonight
out of Deerlaken.
Former Marine Colonel
Jack Hastings
announcing today
that he's running for mayor
as a Democrat.
While Braun may have
an incumbent's advantage,
political insiders say Hastings
is likely to give him
a run for his money.
Happening now, a major...
JACK: Well, how much
is this gonna cost?
GARY:
You let me worry about that.
What I need from you
are people, volunteers.
We got a lot of legwork
if we're gonna make a noise
in this thing.
- More coffee?
- Oh, I'm good.
No, I'm good, Lizzie.
Thanks.
You know what I do need?
I need a couple buckets
of that gravy
so I can take a bath in it.
So good.
Delicious.
(takes deep breath)
My compliments to the chef.
I'll let Ziggy know.
Great.
That ought to cheer him up.
JACK:
Just the check, Lizzie.
Will do, Jack.
GARY: What's the deal
with the happy chef?
JACK:
Oh, Ziggy's all right.
- Oh?
- He owns the place.
Eh, he may be a bit peeved
about the election thing.
He's Mayor Braun's brother.
Why isn't this place
called Braun's?
The Hansens owned this place
since probably... Korea.
Bobby Hansen started it,
his kids ran it for years,
and had to sell
once the base closed,
but no matter who owns it,
it'll always be Hansen's.
Base closing
really hammered this place.
Yeah, it did.
More than half of
our storefronts have shut down.
In fact, we're losing
our high school
if we can't come up
with the funding.
But no matter what folks
might wish for here,
it ain't coming back.
"Vote for Jack Hastings,
"'cause no matter
what you wish for,
- it ain't never coming back."
- (chuckling)
- I like it. It's good.
- Well...
- I'm not gonna lie to people.
- No, I know. I know.
I was just being witty
and cynical.
Can't win a battle
if you're not honest
about what you're
really up against.
No, you cannot.
(footsteps approaching)
LIZZIE:
Not enough for a bath,
but you can get
a good foot soak in.
GARY:
Thank you.
- A straw.
- (chuckling)
- (claps)
- GARY: All right, let's bring it in.
Everybody in. Ah...
- phone bank!
- OTHERS: Phone bank.
Well, you'll get it next time.
Okay, I want you to be upbeat.
I want you to be positive.
Active participation
is what we're looking for.
Would they volunteer?
Would they donate?
Can we drop off a lawn sign?
- Would they donate?
- (laughs)
Would they donate?
Yes, write that down.
That's good.
Got some sample scripts
for you there.
Contact list there.
To the ramparts!
That means go. You can begin.
- Oh.
- Now...
you guys are my "A" team.
So, first, we're going to take
these lawn signs,
and we're going to put them
in all available public spaces.
I want them visible
but not obnoxiously so.
Isn't it a little early
for lawn signs?
DIANA:
I'm sorry. She just, um...
'Cause just around here,
sometimes people
aren't so keen...
- Mm-hmm.
- But then, I do appreciate
that you got the signs made.
- Mm-hmm.
- GARY: I mean, we've always used lawn signs.
- Yeah.
- They've worked for hundreds of years, so...
- Great.
- Yeah, let's just use 'em.
Great. All right, Ann?
- Hmm? Okay.
- I want you to take the downtown area.
Martha, Dave, how about
everything west of 39?

This is the voter contact list.

I want you to call
the voter contact list.
We're already voting
for the Colonel.
Okay? Good.
Let's go do the signs, too.

He is. He is a good man.
So, is this your

No, this is

BIG MIKE:
Hey, guys.
Jack's already got lawn signs
printed up. (chuckles)
Well, I got to head out.
Got a lot of work
to catch up on.
Pleasure meeting everybody.
BRAUN: Hey, Father,
you want to go with him?
He might need a miracle or two.
This town hasn't had
a Democrat mayor
since La Follette
ruled these parts, and...
hasn't had a Democratic Party
since the '70s.

Okay.

Who wants something to eat?
They're so delicious.
Okay.
What's going on?
Why all the long faces?
Did you not see it?
The billboard.
The one on Main with the giant
"Vote for Mayor Braun"?
- Yes.
- What about it?
(scoffs) "What about it?"
That's the
Macgregor Ford billboard.
Okay.
Okay, so it's been
the Macgregor Ford billboard
for probably 40 years.
God only knows
how much it cost.
And it looks like Braun has
taken over Jerry's old office
as some sort of
campaign headquarters.
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Hold on. Hold on.
Um, are you telling me
that the mayor,
who's running for reelection,
has decided to advertise
his campaign for mayor?
And he's doing it from a...
campaign office?
Oh, my God!
Oh, I... This is...
This is overwhelming to me.
(laughing):
Oh, my God.
I don't... I...
What... (stammering)
I have the vapors. I...
I'm hyperventilating.
Why are these spoons
just standing there?
You don't get it.
(laughing)
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- (laughs)
You don't get it.
Do you have any idea
how much that costs?
Well, that space
is 3,800 square feet,
and it runs for
$20 a square foot yearly.
Prorated to two months
is $7,600.
The billboard, a little bit
harder to decipher.
But I'd say,
based on the location
and Mayor Braun's desperation,
8K all-in.
Design and printing included.
I don't know,
maybe something like that.
Well, there's no way that
Braun's got that much money.
Unless... this little
campaign of ours
has caught the attention of
the national Republican Party
and they are sending money
and reinforcements.
- (quiet gasping)
- It's okay.
It's exactly what
we wanted to happen.
They are scared.
On a national level,
they are scared
of Colonel Jack.
So we have to plan
our next move.
Come here.
Gather round.
We're going to need...
something a little like...
- that.

of the, um...
What did you call that?
- Uh, farm-to-table.
- The farm-to-table.
I mean, I guess
it all kind of, uh...
all goes from farms to tables
of some kind.
RICHARD: We're so excited
that you're all here.
And we are so thankful
to our old friend
for presenting us
with another informative and,
uh, just stimulating evening.
- Oh.
- (laughter)
RICHARD:
You know him. You love him.
- And sometimes hate.
- (laughter)
- Hate writing the checks, but, uh, you know.
- Yeah.
- Gary.
- Thank you. Thanks so much.
Thanks for coming.
And thank you...
Keep that going
for the Peelers, please.
Their tremendous hospitality.
Listen, I'm not gonna take up
too much of your time
other than to say
thank you all for being here.
One thing I do want to say,
though, is that
Colonel Jack Hastings
is the embodiment
of America's real greatness.
Service to nation,
hard work, faith.
Republicans don't own
those values, do they?
- (crowd murmuring)
- They don't own 'em.
They can't.
Inclusion.
That's the most important
of all.
But sometimes,
we get comfortable
in our own little
ideological bubbles.
I see them.
You can't see them,
necessarily, but I see 'em.
There's a little bubble there.
- (laughter)
- There's a little bubble there.
And we forget to reach out.
To find empathy
and understanding
across religious or racial
or just plain geographical
boundaries.
And I hope tonight changes
that, even just a little bit.
So, without further ado,
I would like you to join me
in welcoming
the next mayor of
Deerlaken, Wisconsin,
Colonel Jack Hastings.
- (applause, whooping)
- MAN: Hear, hear.
Uh, uh... thanks, folks.
And thanks to Gary
- and to the Peelers.
- RICHARD: Thank you.
Wow, this is a great house.
It's a great house.
Um...
(chuckles quietly)
I see some of you are...
wondering what I'm doing here.
And...
I think I'm wondering the same.
Uh...
I guess that's the point.
Without all this,
you might never have met me.
And I certainly
wouldn't have met you.
But...
...uh, now we have.
(sighs)
So, uh...
Um...
Colonel, Colonel.
- Yeah.
- Gary Zimmer from "The D.C. Bugle."
- (laughter)
- Um, why...
why should a bunch of uptight
Upper West Siders care about
a little town in Wisconsin?
(quiet murmuring)
Uh, it's hard to say.
I guess we're hurting,
looking for help from you.
What can we do to help?
I'll take that. Money.
- (laughter)
- Money.
It's a serious question,
actually.
You know,
our politics seem broken.
Colonel, what do you see is
the system's greatest weakness?
Hmm, well, I guess,
for one thing,
this.
Here, tonight.
And I mean no disrespect.
I just think
this seems a bit crazy.
I want to help my town.
I want to be mayor,
some town in the middle
of Wisconsin.
So, instead of being home
working on some smart things
to help my town,
I have to fly here to your town
and convince you
that my town's worth saving.
And that I'm worth it.
And that saving it
is worth it to you.
All so you can give me
some money.
Not for my town, but for me.
To help convince my town
that I'm worth it.
I mean...
I don't know,
it just sounds so stupid.

Ladies and gentlemen,

I am fired...
Why wouldn't I be fired up?
I am working with the future

I tell you how

He can tell you how often
people say they go to church.
She can tell you

I can tell you
if God is in their hearts.
- Oh, my God.
- Tina's in online analytics.
KURT:
Hey, can I just say...
we take deception into account,

Yeah, polling is
an art form, but,
you know, there's plenty
of science to back it up.

still calling landlines.
People tell computers
the truth, right?
Their desires,
their prejudices.
Every search,
every transaction...
it's an unguarded
private moment.
So there's no, uh,
margin of error, you know?
The digital footprint
is your true self.
But, surely,
people are more complicated
than their online transactions.

Sir Elton, thank you

Everyone, this is

Let's get through
the pleasantries.
This is Jack Hastings
and his daughter Diana.
ELTON (robotic, melodic voice):
Hello to you.
GARY: All right, well,
let's get right to it, then.
ELTON (tune of "Hava Nagila"):
Tell me, what is your position
concerning the settlement
of Kevyat Sharim?
Uh...
I'm not sure I...
Israel.
Jack believes
that sovereign nations
are entitled to self-defense.
ELTON:
Strongly?
Strongly believes, yes.

An election is a moral horror,
as bad as a battle
but without the blood.
That's George Bernard Shaw.

KURT:
Seemed like a really nice guy.
Actually looked
pretty good, right?
- Yeah.
- Surprisingly robust.
Elton Chambers is in.
- Oh.
- TINA: Ah. All right.
Making it rain.
He actually has a machine

GARY: This margin of error

Excuse me. Gary...
- Mr. Zimmer.
- Mm-mm.
- Becca, super PAC.
- Uh...
Okay.
- Uh, big guy?
- GARY: Hmm?
We got a problem.
(keypad beeps)
Hey, everybody.
Hard at work, I see.
That's good.
That's good.
I had a couple of questions.
The first is: What the fuck?!
What tactical genius in here
thought it might be a good idea
to carpet-bomb
a particular neighborhood
in this town
with flyers suggesting
that Colonel Jack Hastings
- would make sure...
- (sighs): Fuck.
- ...that contraception
is paid for by the government?
Uh, I did.
- KURT (shuddering): Oh.
- TINA: The data showed an
unusually concentrated grouping
of single women in the area
who are deeply interested
in reproductive rights.
And you know why that is?
(chuckling):
Well, "why" is not really...
Because this "concentrated
grouping of single women,"
as you put it, is a convent.
They are nuns.
Which is how many of them are
going to end up voting for us.
"Nuns" of them. Zero.
- (laughs)
- It's not funny.
I'm not laughing.
(sighs) Fuck.
Well, I think we can
appreciate the humor
in this very honest mistake.
And the fact that the nuns
are generously turning
the other cheek
makes it a nonstory, but...
FAITH:
Brooke, Brooke, if I may.
Uh, this is really just
another perfect example
of the D.C. elite coming into
a place they don't understand
and trying to dictate
how we should live.
The Democrat Party can't win.
They're getting desperate.
They don't know us,
they don't want to know us,
- and they look down on our values.
- GARY: No, no.
That's "we." You're D.C. elite.
Oh, no, actually,
I'm from here.
BROOKE:
Faith, I didn't know that.
- You're from Wisconsin?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Well, no, "Deer-lake-en."
I'm from "Deer-lake-en."
- What? Whoa.
- BROOKE: Oh. Wow.
So this campaign has been
a bit of a homecoming.
- It really is, Brooke. Thank you.
- No, no.
No, no, that's a lie.
That's a lie.
- No, it's...
- You're lying.
- It's-it's the truth.
- She's ly... That's...
- I'm from here.
- No, that... What are you even doing?
- (laughing): Okay.
- I-I am from here.
- You're not from here!
- Well, as always, a great

- Thank you both.
- Unfortunately, we have to leave it there.
- She' a li...
Coming up, we'll look at more

four years from now.
Why do you even lie
about something like that?
(sighs) Honestly, I, uh...
I don't even know.
(mocking):
"I... I don't even know."
Wh-What do you mean,
you don't know?
You can't just lie
about something like that.
You just walk away?
You just told America that
you're from "Deer-lake-en"?
That's not even
how you pronounce it!
"Deer-lake-en," my ass.
Oh, my God.
She's a fucking genius!
Oh!
Oh, my God, I hate her so much.
I hate her. I hate her.
She said it,

Hello, everybody.

Uh, can I have one of those?
No.
GARY: What you guys doing?

DIANA: Yeah, they're just

Education. That's important.
Hey, are we sure that we want
to be doing this here
and not in Faith's room
or the mayor's office?
Because right now I'm not sure
that our opposition knows
exactly what we're about to do.
And that seems unfair.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't put 'em away
on my account.
Why don't we got one of
those overhead projectors
- that you have at a bowling alley?
- Stop.
- Kurt, you don't have to leave.
- So everybody here can see it.
Wouldn't that be good?
Kurt, come on.
Mmm!
Why do you talk
to them like that?
Like what?
Like that.
Like they're idiots.
(inhales sharply)
Well...
(chuckles)
Listen.
(sighs)
I saw some polls.
If we don't
figure this out soon,
there's no way
we're gonna beat her.
- Our demographics are so...
- "Her"?
- Who?
- Her.
DIANA: I mean, you said,
if we don't figure it out soon,
we're not gonna be able
to beat her.
We're not gonna beat
her candidate, Braun.
Mayor Braun.
Herr... Herr Braun.
Herr, her. Same thing.
DIANA:
Mm-hmm.
Look, Gary, I don't, um,
really understand
how you guys do things in D.C.,
but if you're gonna work
for my father,
you need to treat people
with respect.
- With. With.
- What?
Work with your father, not for.
You said "for."
It's a semantic thing, but...
it's... you know,
it's an important distinction.
Just so you know,
they don't actually serve
hamburgers and Budweiser here,
'cause it's a hofbrau house,
so they would serve
German food and German beers.
They've been patronizing you.
Just so you know, I don't even
like hamburgers or Budweiser,
so I've been
patronizing them...
- the whole time.
- Okay. Ah.
Did a little switcheroo.
Oh, and just so you know,
congratulations.

NEWSWOMAN:

- NEWSMAN: Mm-hmm. Absolutely.
- Military man.
- From the heartland.
- Yep.
- No greater place in America.
- (chuckling)
- No, no.
- Am I right?
- Nope.

No, not just the loony left.
He's not just a Democrat.
- No.
- He has joined the...

- Socialism. - Mm-hmm.
Socialism. Hmm.
Do you think
it hurts our military
to have one of their own
throw in with the Democrats?
I know that if I had served,
I wouldn't like it.
Mm. Yeah.
FAITH (from other room):
Wow, that was a harsh segment.
- Cutting but fair.

last night and sent it to them

TINA:

GARY:
Hey. Is your dad here?
Yeah. Dad!

- Come on in, Colonel.
So, um, we can't win.
The people in this town
are pretty set in their ways.
And we lost the eight nuns.
That wasn't good.
So, we can't win.
Uh... y-you know,
we appreciate all you done.
I mean, the campaign and, uh...
I'm just sorry
we let you down, but...
well, all I can say
is thank you.
Really, Gary,
thank you for everything.
It was a hell of a ride.

- GARY: Are you shitting me?
All I have to say is
we can't win,
and you're-you're through,
you're out.
- You said we can't win.
- Unless.
We can't win unless...
You didn't let me finish.
We can't win unless
it turns out that this town
isn't the Mayberry
everybody thinks it is.
I just got a little piece
of intel
that's kind of intriguing.
So, the mayor's brother Ziggy,
he had an Oxy problem.
Well, he was a roofer
and got hurt on the job.
Yes, well,
what you might not know
is that the mayor
pulled some strings,
kept him out of jail,
got him into rehab.
That is abuse of power,
nepotism.
- Probably some clerical shit in there.
- (laughs): Come on.
Gary.
But we're the good guys, right?
Yeah, we're the good guys.
When they go low...
We go high.
Unless we also need to go low,
apparently. (chuckles)
Only to keep those who
would go lower out of power.
So, when they go low,
we go higher,
incrementally, in relation
to how low they went.
Regrettably, yes.
When they go low,
we go almost as low,
but we feel worse doing it.
You think they thought twice
about making your dad
look like a PTS nutcase?
And I'm going low because
I'm gonna tell the truth
about the mayor?
His brother's fragile, Gary.
This town is fragile.
The whole area is fragile.
Our democracy.
(scoffs) Stop.
We're not doing it.
Okay?
People are gonna get hurt.
I'm sorry... I really am...
but sometimes good people
have to do shitty things
in service of the greater good.
Isn't that right, Colonel?

- DIANA: Hey.
Hey.
Yeah?
- Gary, stop.

(scoffs):
What?
Is this politics?
It's not politics anymore,
Diana.
It's... it's math.
That's what an election is.
It's just math.
We need what they get plus one.

- It is. You know what, he's the mayor.
- He betrayed us.
GARY: He betrayed us,
and it's disappointing.
- KURT: I'm hurt.
- But I'm not mad.
- KURT: No, I'm just disappointed.
- Me, too.
Tonight, we have this picture
of the alleged
ten-year-old love child
of the Wisconsin mayor
and the girl's mother.
We've obscured the child's face
to protect her identity
but left enough clues
so that you can probably
figure it out.
NEWSWOMAN: To discuss this
important, late-breaking story,
we go to our panel
with a feature
you'll only see here on CNN:
the Duodecabox.
What do you think,
Phil, Diane, Liz, Carl,
Barbara and... let's say Craig?
(all talking at once)
(Faith grunts angrily)
Kaylee?
- Kaylee.
- Y-Yeah.
- Can you clean this up, please?
- Oh, sure.
It was an accident
with the sandwich. Thank you.

MAN:
Yeah, guns save lives.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
It has been
a hard-fought campaign,
but now it's in the hands
of the voters.
And excuse me... there's
the Colonel right there.
- (Jack chuckling)
- Colonel, come on in.
- Diana.
- Hi. - Hi. Good morning.
Did you get some rest?
Yeah, we got a little bit.
- Excuse us, folks.
- Good morning. Good morning.
- Excuse us. Excuse us.

BRAUN:
There he is.
- Billy. Hey.

- How are you? How are you?
- Good to see you.
How about a picture?

Your dad is really something.

So have you.
Thank you for everything.
- It's been...
- My pleasure.
- So...
- I was thinking, maybe later,
if you want to watch
the returns come in?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'd love to.
Oh. Oh, shoot.
You know what? I have to
head back to the farm,
- but I'll see you later, okay?
- Okay.
Okay.
Diana, aren't you gonna vote?
GARY:
Nothing?
- No early returns?
- MAN: Nothing.
- What about exit polling?
- No exit polling.
Well, is there
another precinct?
No.
Well, where else can they vote?
Well, they can't vote
anywhere else.
Was it all early voting?
No early voting, no.
Nothing.
What do you mean,
nobody has voted yet?
Uh, big guy.
You're gonna want to see this.
...smear Mayor Braun
with the falsehood
of an illegitimate child.
Which, as the report
you just read stated,
is actually the man's
dear niece.
Has the Hastings campaign
apologized?
FAITH: Uh, no, they haven't,
and it-it's too late for that.
- GARY: Oh, fuck!
- Mayor Braun continues to
focus on the issues.
And quite frankly, Brooke,
the media owes the mayor
an apology, as well,
for credulously covering
a poorly sourced story.
Faith! Congratulations.
Well done.
- What the fuck are you doing?
- A new low.
Oh, yeah, like I leaked
a cocked-up story
about a bastard child
who happens to be
the man's fucking niece.
- Please, Gary.
- You fed me that bullshit.
You know, go fuck yourself.
- You go fuck yourself.
- You go fuck your...
BROOKE (chuckling):
Okay, you two.
Unfortunately, we're gonna
have to leave it there.
Thank you so much, Brooke.
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks, Brooke.
- Thank you.
- CAMERAMAN: We're clear.
Why would I leak this? Huh?
Oh, to just make me
take the bait.
You didn't just want to win.
You wanted to castrate me,
didn't you?
If I wanted to cut
your dick off,
I would have done it
in front of you
just to see the last look
of horror in your eyes.
You're telling the truth.
No shit.
What the fuck is going on here?
BECCA:
Evan?
What...
Evan.
(laughing):
Evan, oh, my God.
- What's up, Becca?
- How the hell are you?
- Hiya. Nice to see you.
- Good to see you.
- How's everything?
- Yeah, I mean, it's going.
What the hell?
How the hell does he know her?
Is he from here?
Gary, look at his shoes.
I mean, really.
And we have Alan to thank
for bringing this man
- to our attention.
- It's Evan.
Did I happen to mention that...
Holy shit.
- What? What?
- Come on!
ALDERMAN: So, with 100%
of the vote counted,
the mayoral race is tied.

- One vote to one vote.

No.
Okay, no, no, no,

Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hold on. I, uh...
I don't...
I don't know exactly
what's going on here,
but it's weird.
Could somebody please
explain to me
- what's happening?
- Well, we had an election.
- Yes, I know that.
- And we gave it our best.
Just didn't work out.
Didn't work out, Jack?
Come on.
Do you know how much money
we invested in this?
Yeah, if the news media
is to be believed,
more than $45 million was
raised between the two of you.
- (laughing)
- (cheering, applause)
(laughing)
Oh, shit.
Did you sucker me, Jack?
I guess.
GARY:
You know what? Folks, sorry,
but I'm getting
all that money back.
From where?
We put millions
into those PACs.
Well, campaign finance law says
that money needn't be
accounted for.
- (laughter, applause)
- Oh, my God.
I got to give it to this place.
Hey, Alan.
Uh, it's Evan.
Shit weasel.
You're from this town,
aren't you?
- Yeah.
- You set this whole thing up.
You set me up, huh?
You are so fired,
and you're going to jail!
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
It was me. I did it.
You?
(scoffs):
Wh...
Why?
You know...
(laughing): it was just
this weird idea I had
'cause the town needed money.
(chuckles)
So you...
Uh, shot the video,
and then had Evan
show it to you.
Uh, I...
We needed 750 grand
over three years
to keep the school
from closing down.
We blew way past that.
We got enough to buy back
the base, redevelop it.
And the speech,
the viral speech?
BRAUN:
Can I get a motion to vote?
JACK: Actually,
I'm here about that...
Fuck, what's the word?
Resolution.
- I'll get it.
- DIANA: Mike, do you want to help him and...
Yeah.
Just have it low enough.
BRAUN: Just leave enough room
for that road sign in there.
- Uh, am I supposed to have these on?
- DIANA: No glasses.
- I'm lost.
- (laughter)
DIANA (sighs):
Okay, Dad, that's good,
but you have to leave after.
All right, one more time.
I guess they weren't
principles.
They're just hobbies.
DIANA:
Holy shit, I think we got it.
- (laughter, cheering)
- Oh, thank God.
(cheering, whooping)
That was really just
baiting the hook.
You guys took it from there.
I was never expecting her.
Oh, I had a fucking blast.
So you used me.
We used you?
You guys only show up here
once every four years,
and only then
'cause it's a swing state.
And then, when it's over,
you're gone.
But we're still here
with all the same problems
we had before,
just waiting around
for you to come back
and make the same
empty promises as last time.
We used the system.
You make millions of dollars
funneling tens of millions
of dollars
into this election economy.
All we did is take a cut.
Hmm.
Well...
I guess I just...
I thought that maybe you and I
had a little something.
(chuckles softly)
(chuckling):
I'm 28. I mean...
In what world
would this be okay?
D.C. and L.A.,
parts of New York,
- Miami, maybe Dallas.
- Mm.
(chuckles)
Look...
- It wasn't personal.
- Mm.
It was math.
Math.
But this system,
the way we elect people,
it's terrifying.
And exhausting.
And I think it's
driving us all insane.

Colonel Jack Hastings,

did the media fall
for a false narrative
just because it fit
into our preconceived notion
of the divide of this country
between red and blue
without actually
checking the facts?
Were we irresponsible?
Well, we're the news.
Are we not supposed to
cover the news?
I mean, these are
newsworthy stories.
We're absolutely in the right
to cover them.
It is literally our job
to cover the news.
But isn't there a way
to report the news
without so much speculation,
without a false sense
of urgency
that causes us to
breathlessly report "facts"
that maybe are not facts?
And are we framing
these stories

Is there a better way

JON STEWART: Could something
like this happen?
Legally, this could
absolutely happen.
Somebody could create
a political organization...
so-called outside group,
a super PAC, 527...
raise an unlimited
amount of money,
and then choose
to give that money
to another organization,
a charity,
and use it for public purposes.
And you don't need
the donors' consent to do that.
The problem we have is that
none of the pieces of
the system are working today.
You have regulators like
the Federal Election Commission
that don't have a quorum,
can't meet,
and when they do, they disagree
on what the law is.
You have Congress deadlocked
so it can't rewrite the laws.
You have the Supreme Court
that thinks that
almost nothing is corrupt
and that citizens won't think
the sale of access...
what the court calls
ingratiation
in return for giving money
to candidates... is a problem.
STEWART: So, to sum up,
we currently have
hundreds of millions
to billions of dollars
that is, uh, uh, untraceable,
uh, that can pour into groups
that are actually coordinating
with-with candidates
who end up having to spend
a good amount of their time
raising more and more money
to keep up
with the arms race
that is occurring.
Uh, the money continues
to pour in and corrupt
not just where
they spend their time
and how they spend their time
but on the types of legislation
that they would even bring
to the fore.
And the one group
that would be charged
with regulating, uh,
this spigot, uh, doesn't meet
'cause there aren't
enough of them.
Yes.
(both laughing)
I realize that's not helpful
to you, but...
It is very helpful.
