This is a very old story...
of a woman whose name was Lachchi.
But, granny...
..Laachi wished for a prince charming
from this very village, didn't she?
Or someone who could live
with her family.
Someone tall, dark and handsome.
What made you settle for someone
from miles away?
Actually the coconut (token) came from
Bhanwar Seth of Navalgarh.
..for his son Kishanlal.
That brought in this change of mind.
Enough of the jokes.
Lachchi, child!
Your granny had offered these
at the time of my wedding.
My o' my! lt's so beautiful!
We both are so fortunate to deck
you up in these ornaments.
And this drape as well.
Don't lift the veil on your own !
Now it will be him who will lift it!
What if he forgets to lift
the veil and goes to sleep?
Who?
Your Kishan?
Silly girl! No man sleeps
on his wedding night..
..and neither does he lets
his partner sleep.
''When the moon sets at midnight
with no one around.''
''Just don't relent,
remain steadfast.''
''When the moon sets at midnight
with no one around.''
''Just don't relent,
remain steadfast.''
''What if he pleads?
- Don't concede.''
''What if he begs?
- Don't yield''
''lf he goes for an aye..
- Go for a nay.''
''lf he goes for a nay..
- Go for an aye.''
''What if he puts me under
an oath of his life?''
''When the moon sets at midnight
with no one around.''
''Just don't relent,
remain steadfast.''
''Don't accede to his pleadings.''
''Don't give in even if he begs.''
''Don't let him remove your ornamenets
or lift your veil.''
''Snub him with your gaze.''
''lf he tries to sweet talk
and convince you..''
''..just shake your head
in the negative.''
''The friends would try to
eavesdrop at the door..''
''..having shed all their inhibitions
for the occasion.''
''lf he pleads?
- Don't budge.''
''lf he begs?
- Don't cave in.''
''Don't puzzle me...''
''it's after many a years,
O' friend..''
''The night to stay awake has arrived.''
''Always had this dream..''
''..and after a long wait..''
''..the night to turn it into
reality has arrived.''
''Don't be envious at others' nuptials.''
''Better get married yourself.''
''Stop speculating and
jump in the fray.''
''When the moon sets at midnight
with no one around.''
''Just don't relent,
remain steadfast.''
''Don't accede to his pleadings.''
''Don't give in even if he begs.''
''Place my dolls and
toys in the palanquin.''
''Tell brother to bring me
all of granny's stories.''
''The palanquin awaits me.''
''The palanquin awaits me.''
''l wish to take mother along.''
''Send my friends with me.''
''O' father, your daughter
has never gone alone.''
''Your daughter has never come alone.''
''The palanquin awaits me.''
''The palanquin awaits me.''
''The palanquin awaits me.''
''The palanquin awaits me.''
Fruits.. flowers.. rosewater..'
..rosewater..'
Fruits.. flowers.. rosewater..'
Give it. Give it to me.
Give it to me it might fall.
Fruits.. flowers.. rosewater..'
lt is burning hot.
You want to continue travelling?
Our halting now would mean
reaching home late in the night.
Yeah, sure! And continuing like this
we may never reach home..
Keep quiet, Kanwar.
Might as well eat something,
Bhanwar and take some rest.
Yes. Aunt's right.
Let's proceed after lunch, brother.
You'll always talk about
spending money, Kanwarlal.
Banwari!
Yes, stop it! Stop!
Stop the carts!
Uncle says 128 ghosts reside here!
He is saying not to stop here.
Hand him a pipe and
all the ghosts will vanish.
C'mon, fast.
Keep everything there.
C'mon, hurry up.
What are you doing there?
Was it necessary to halt here?
C'mon. Come along.
Go, daughter-in-law, freshen up.
Let's go, Kamli.
What are you looking at?
- You are completely okay.
Rakma fooled me saying that
you are squint-eyed.
As if this crow was waiting for us!
Come, let's go and clean it fast.
Seems he too has gone crazy.
Wow! So beautiful!
Shh.. it might fly away.
Kamli!
Stuck at one spot? Massage here too.
Fruits.. flowers..'
- What are you doing, brother?
Oh, you messed it up.
Fruits.. flowers.. rosewater..'
Sweets!
- l've already added that.
What happened?! Why are you running?!
- Where were you?
l was...
but what happened?
C'mon, child, eat fast.
Oh ! Going now!'
Will be out of sight forever'
Who? Talking about the marriage party?
lt was supposed to go.
No, dear, he means the bride and
not the marriage party'
l see.'
Was she a moon during the day or the
sun spreading its light in the night?'
l've seen many a beautiful faces.'
But she was exceptional!
Her beauty was unparalleled.'
But, she's going away.'
What will l do if she goes away?
How will l be able to see her again?'
l have always seen a ghost
entering a human being.
How come the situation
has reversed today?
Despite being a ghost he is talking
all nonsense like a human being.
Take care of him, dear.
This is going to change
all the equations.'
Neither the sun nor
the moon will rise.'
The rivers and the seas will dry up.'
Lo, he has turned into a poet as well.
l won't be able to live without her.'
l won't be able to live.'
Kamli!
Brother...
here, have some.
No thanks. Better you only eat.
And listen, Anusuya..
don't repeat it again.
Good that father didn't spot you.
Had he done so, he would have
been very upset with you.
Eating berries, huh !
Bless you, son !
Wish you an everlasting wedded life!
Bless you, brother-in-law!
l wish eternal bliss
to the lovely couple!
Come.
Rose water..'
Flowers and fruits are also done.'
Turban..'
lf we multiply two by
sixty or seventy five rather..'
..still it doesn't reconcile..'
Rosewater is here, even the turban..'
..flowers, fruits..'
..no it is rosewater,
flowers.. fruits..'
lt's so humid tonight, isn't it?
- What?
Yeah
Should l open the window?
- What?
Yeah.
Won't you take off my veil?
Oh !
Why are you staring at me like this?
Coconut!
- What?
Yes, l forgot to add the money
paid for buying coconuts.
Listen..
You were busy with the accounts
while on our way, and the same here?
ls this any time for accounts?
- Hey!
Business and accounts are the foremost
duties of a trader.
The marriage accounts
weren't tallying.
My father can never
tolerate such blunders.
One.. Two..
So you are scared of your father,
that's why you are tallying accounts?
Enough of it now.
Do the rest in the morning.
No way.
l am leaving town tomorrow morning.
Leaving?
For what?
- For business what else?
l'll leave early in the morning.
Tomorrow!?
You know it is one of the
most auspicious day tomorrow...
which arrives only
once in seven years.
The business will flourish.
But l'd heard that this mansion
is filled with loads of wealth.
Without a doubt.
Diamonds, pearls,
precious jewels and what not...
But it feels good only when the wealth
multiplies with each passing day.
My father says...
only wealth matters.
Moreover it's just a matter
of five years.
They will pass away in a snap...
in a snap...
they will just fly away.
l too will accompany you.
Will l do business there
or look after you
These accounts...
Will you leave me behind, all alone?
Why alone?
Everyone's there in the house.
There is no dearth of anything
in this house..
l mean, eat the best of delicacies...
wear silk and satin...
serve and take care of mother
and father.
And five years will pass in a snap...
Pass in a blink. Hmm!
Rather l would be the one staying
all alone in a new place.
Hey, you.. are crying?
Don't cry.
Come with me. Come.
Listen...
Listen to me.. listen...
Time will just fly by.
And then it would be
this very mansion...
everything would be the same
and we will be together again.
Go to sleep, now.
Go to sleep.
l will take some time.
l have to submit the account books to
father before leaving in the morning.
And the accounts are still pending.
Where are you going?
l'll sleep near the window after
reconciling the accounts.
Mother said...
Why ignite passion...
for only one night.
Better go to sleep.
Sleep.
La..
Lachchi?
lt's late!?
No one knows the pain of a solitary
life better than l do.
Don't lose heart like this.
C'mon, go and refresh yourself.
You have to see Kisna
off before sunrise.
Right?
Come.
The pleasure of business is
the biggest of all pleasures.
Rest everything is a big trap.
Even the Lord Himself is
the greatest of businessman.
He keeps a count of every breath.
Be it the raindrops or
the movement of the winds..
He maintains a perfect account of each
and every particle in this universe.
When there is no mistake
in His accounts..
..how can there be a mistake in the
merchant Bhanwarlal's account books?
Kanwarlal.. talking calculations
Banwari!
Distribute sweets in the village!
For the first time in his life
Kanwarlal has talked sense.
Where are you going?
- To distribute sweets.
ls it necessary for
brother Kishan to go?
There is a reason for his going.
But the best part is...
your brother will definitely
come back.
C'mon.
- Will l too be required to go someday?
No, l will never let you go.
Come now.
Listen...
get back ten times of what
you are taking with you.
Sure, father.
Only if you had gone
after a few days...
He is going with everyone's knowledge.
Your husband went away
without informing anyone...
and hasn't come back ever since.
God knows...
Enough. The auspicious moment
is passing away.
And not in the next seven years
will it come again.
l have seen all of them in my lifetime.
Bless you with a long life, son !
Wish you everlasting happiness!
Where is your Bhabhi (sister-in-law).
Listen !
He is still an amateur in business.
Stay with Kisna, always.
Don't ever leave him alone.
Keep sending your news, Kisna.
Don't cry... don't.
He's the same fellow, right?
Lachchi's better-half.
Yes, the husband of that pretty one.
- He is the same.
But, how come he's here?
He has already left home while..
..the fragrance of the bride's henna
is still fresh.
Let me see what it's all about.
Greetings!
Greetings!
This is a killing heat wave, isn't it?
Yes... but where did you come from?
l didn't see you coming.
Coming and going are beyond
human control, brother.
Such a nice well.
Whoever got it made indeed
did a very virtuous deed.
My grandfather got it made.
Oh ! Pardon me, sir!
My humblest regards, sir!
You seem to be new to the area...
or else you must have definitely
known of sir's glorious lineage.
The glory of Seth Bhanwarlal
of Navalgarh is all over.
l feel blessed to have seen you
in person, sir.
Sir...
- Yes?
Should l ask you something
if you don't mind?
You seem to be just married.
What makes you leave so soon?
Doesn't matter if you don't want to
disclose. Pardon me, sir.. if..
No, no.
The turmeric tan can wait
to fade away..
..but my father says that auspicious
moments are hard to come by.
l am going for business.
For five years.
Leaving behind the bride alone?
Sir, you are wasting time
by talking to strangers..
..will result in our getting
affected by the heatstroke.
As it is we have to still cover
a lot of distance. Come, let's go.
Very true!
Fool, not even the divine treasures
can get the passing moment back.
You still have time to
go back to your bride.
When overflowing youth has
failed to stop him..
..what will he listen to you, dear?
Nincompoop! ls wealth meant
for man or vice-versa.
Poor bride! She has to abide
by her husband's wishes.
Yeah ! The son abides by
his father's wishes..
..and the father by
the 'wish of the wealth'!
lt's a great idea!'
l will take on the guise of Seth's
son to enter the mansion.'
And there would be no one to question
me for the next five years.'
Despite being a ghost
he has loved truly.
His love is genuine.
O' God.. this is incomprehensible?
Stop him, dear.
My dear, the storm of love
is stoppable by none.
ldiot, wear the turban at least.
That's better.
Phutarmal...
what am l seeing?
Sir...
- He seems like our Kisanlal.
Yes, sir, he does look
like our Kisanlal.
But what makes him
come back from midway?
Phutarmal, a man becomes useless
after marriage.
All hopes of increased earning
have gone kaput!
One can either do business
or cozy up to his wife.
Father.. father...
father, listen to me first.
- What the heck do you want me to hear?
lf you didn't wish to go for business
just for the sake of your wife...
why did you waste these three days,
you no-gooder!
No, father.. l came back
to ask you something.
lf you don't wish, l will return
without entering the house.
Tell me! What did you want to ask?!
l happened to meet a sage on my way.
Kishanlal, there isn't any dearth of
sages and ascetics in this country.
You haven't come back
by losing money...
to some deceitful disguised sage,
have you?
No, no.. father.. father...
Listen to the whole thing.
- Hmm!
He was seated in deep meditation.
Since ages, l suppose.
His whole body was covered
with termites.
l removed all that very gently
and carefully.
Then l drew water from the well,
gave him a nice bath...
fed him to his heart's content and
served him as best as l could.
Bless you.
- He said the same.
What?
- Bless you.' And he granted me a boon.
The sage granted me a boon
that every morning...
Hold it! Hold it!
Phutarmal-ji,
make a move now.
He will go on and
on with his tall tale.
Make a move!
- Sir!
Boon !
Are you crazy?!
One should be selective
of the audience.
Tell me, what boon did he grant you?
Father, he granted me a boon
that every morning...
the moment l get down from my bed..
..l will get five gold coins.
Well, l will abide by your orders!
Where?!
Child.. stay here..
and help your father.
Now go and take some rest.
- As you order, father.
And, listen...
this boon thing shouldn't fall
on a second ear.
No way! No first.. no second!
And, listen...
go to bed early.
You have to get up early, right?
And l forgot something, child.
- Now what, father?
Bless you, my son !
Brother Kishan has come!
- What?
Mother.. Kishan Bhaiyya (brother)
has come!
Come, let's tell everyone.
- C'mon.
So soon?
What's the matter, Kisna?
You returned midway?
ls everything alright?
Came back so soon?
My dear son !
Brother-in-law!
- Kisna!
Draw a few buckets of water
from the well.
Son, have a bath. The food will be
ready in the meanwhile.

A request will be needed even
today to lift the veil!
You're looking at me as
if for the first time.
Yeah, you were too engrossed in
the accounts to even look at me!
This...
This face.. this beauty...
hope it's not an illusion.
There would be no one more
beautiful than you...
and more fortunate than me,
in the whole world.
So you have calculated
the fortunes of the whole world!
l am speaking the truth.
Why did you go in the first place,
by breaking my heart?
l cried so much.
You would have drowned in my tears.
l have indeed drowned.
See l pulled you back.
l knew that you would
be back from midway.
The stars in the night would have
never allowed you to proceed further.
Why did you go?
- Where did l go?
l was very much near you.
Having seen you...
l never separated from you
even for a moment...
and nor do l ever want to separate.
Can one see anything else having
seen the depth of your eyes?
Can one go anywhere after getting
mesmerised with your lips?
My wish was granted.
Who knows whether your wish
was granted or not.
Get to know the facts first.
l may be someone else.
An imposter in the guise
of your husband.
The same frame..
the same form..
..the same moustache and
the same voice.
Yes, this new way of words,
this flowery language..
..is something that l am hearing
for the first time.
To tell you the truth...
instead of a husband engrossed
in accounts and figures...
l would love an imposter
spouse like you.
l would adore him much more!
No, Lachchi.
l'm not your husband.
You spotted that unique bird
near the well, didn't you?
And the squirrel that
stopped you on your way.
All that.. was me.
l'm an illusionist. A spirit.
l can assume any form as
and when l wish.
l am in love with you.
And that made me take on your
husband's guise to meet you.
But for my own revelation...
no one would have known the reality
of this form of mine.
Father is only concerned with
his five gold coins everyday.
But had l not disclosed
this to you, Lachho...
it would have been impossible
for me to even breath.
l would have been suffocated.
My love is yours, Lachho.
My love is true.
When you felt someone's
presence near the pond...
and your lips started to
tremble just like this...
l lost myself.
l was totally transformed.
l tuned into a deep longing...
to spend every moment with you...
to be one with you.
A longing to become one
with your breaths.
You fool, what's the need to tell
all this to Lachchi?
She would have unhesitatingly
made love with you...
taking you to be her real husband.
- Just see the irony, dear.
The man who took the marriage
vows with her...
of being her spouse for seven lives
left her in less than seven hours even.
And look at him. Despite being a ghost
he couldn't lie to her.
Love has made him go
total nuts, my dear.
What's the need to speak the truth?
Deception and betrayal are
like second nature to men.
Even the divine beings have sinned.
But no woman would have
ever faced such a dilemma.
Life is difficult without you, now.
And death is impossible.
But if it's not your wish...
l will go back, this very moment.
How could l live a dream?
l am a ghost, after all.
Just let me know of your wish, Lachchi.
''Never thought...''
''of getting to live such a life.''
''The eyes would be thirsty
for their own tears''
Don't cry, Lachchi.
Don't.
No one ever asked me my wish.
And you happen to ask it today.
Do you know how difficult
it is to answer?
You are asking me to be yours,
of a stranger, on my own will.
No, Lachchi.
l don't want to hurt you.
lnstead of putting you to
any pain.. l would...
prefer to go away.
Couldn't stop the one who was going!
How can l stop the one who
wants to come?
''Burn slowly...''
''on the flame of life.''

Wake up!
Get up! Get up!
lt's dawn !
- So?
Everybody would be waiting for you.
What will they say?
When nature couldn't inhibit
us last night...
what will mere words embarrass us now?
- C'mon.
Who gets to hear such sweet 'come ons'.
What are you doing?
You told me that you're a ghost?
- Top to bottom.
You can't be a ghost.
Ghosts can't be tickled.
Really? What more do you
know about ghosts?
They don't feel the tickling sensation.
Their shadow doesn't fall on ground.
Their feet..
Let me see your feet!
- Hey!
But do you know that
the love of a spirit...
showers along with the clouds.
lt glows with stars...
and rises time and again in
the form of the sun and the moon.
lt spreads its light in the skies.
What?
Sozzled early in the morning?
No, brother.
- But if Kisna returned midway...
why did he not bring Mangilal along?
Who'll take care of
the new business in Jamnagar?
You?
Brother, l heard Phutarmal talking
about some boon..
You never tend to hear what
is useful, Kanwarlal!
But you certainly hear all
the bubbling gossips.
Hey, Banwari!
So, it is dawn finally for you.
- Yes, father.
What?
- You are..
lnstead of smoking pot,
give some thought to work as well.
l was thinking.
- Don't think! Do it! Kanwarlal, do it!
Hey, Banwari!
You were supposed to give me something?
What, father?
- Are you in your senses?
Forgot about the sage's words?
Oh, yeah ! About that boon?
- Speak softly.
About that boon? Father, l've kept
those coins long back.
Kept them!? Where?
You were fast asleep when l came
downstairs in the morning.
You could have woken me up, dear!
But where did you keep them?
- ln your vestment's pocket.
Nothing is here.
- ln that inside pocket.
Bless you with a long life, my son !
Greetings, uncle!
Listen, Kisna...
there were some loud noises
on the terrace last night.
Because of the heavy rains.
Rain ! Here!?
Have you also started to smoke pot?
No, uncle! No!
Rain?
Heavy showers? Banwari!
Lachchi!
Lachchi..
To my dear wife..
Humblest greetings to respected Father!
ls this any time to scare?
- What to do?
At a time when one normally
feels frightful...
you run out of your senses and
immerse in a ghost's embrace.
Mother must be waiting downstairs.
Trying to scare me by
mentioning mother's name?
As if you ever get scared.
- l do get scared, Lachchi.
l'm scared of the moment when the one
with whom you took the wedding vows...
will return and snatch my
Lachchi from me.
Let tomorrow remain a mystery
in today's pursuit.
Easy! Easy! l'll fall!
Sit.
Brother, it tears repeatedly.
- So what? l'll fix it in a snap...
Where's the glue? Ghanshyam..
give me the glue.
Give that to me and l'll fix it.
C'mon, you also apply some.
Greetings.
Who is it?
ls this the mansion of Bhanwarlal Seth?
Yes, it is. What brings you here?
- Brother, this...
Kishan seth?
Kishan seth? You? Here?
When did you reach here?
Greetings!
- Greetings!
Did you not recognise me?
- Well?
l'm Bhoja!
- Bhoj..
From Jamnagar!
You gave me this letter
to deliver at your place.
On the third day of the lunar month.
But if you..
- Come in that corner.. there.
When you had to come here...
Well it is, you were standing
with your back to the sun...
so l couldn't recognise you
all of a sudden.
Bhoji..
- Bhoja!
l mean.. Bhoja..
Greetings, sir.
But when you were planning to come here
what was the need to send the letter?
lnvestigate about me later...
first tell me what took you so long?
- So long!?
Of course it takes so much time
to reach here on foot.
l see.
You must have arrived on
some carriage for sure.
Give me this letter!
And proceed on your work.
l've got a lot of work to do and l am
sure you too have a lot to attend to.
Bhoja..
- Yes, sir.
Go.
Should l go?
- What else?
You want to sit on my head?
Go.
Surprising! He didn't offer any
refreshments or food to a guest!
Kishan seth, when are you coming back?
What are you tearing?
Nothing.
Hey, just now there was a letter
in your hand.
Banwari, it seems you are making
it too strong these days.
You've come back?
l was waiting for you.
Did father give any letter for me?
Bhoja.. why are you staring at me?
Do you not recognise me?
What are you doing?
Sir, tell me first,
how could you reach here so fast?
By flying?
Flying? Me!?
From where?
- Your village.
My village?
- Yes!
No.
l haven't stepped out of here
in the last six months.
Sir.. sir...
l met you in Navalgarh on the
fourteenth day of the lunar month...
at your mansion !
Okay. Okay. Bhoja, enough of the jokes.
Tell me, did father give you anything
else along with the letter?
Sir, it is rather you who
are playing jokes on me.
Am l joking? l am joking?
- Yes.
Oh, l see.
Just see, l dealt with a drunkard.
Am l a drunkard?
- Yes, drunkard!
Hold the stick!
l handed his letter.. to him..
in his own village...
for which he is slandering me.
lt is rightly said,
Do good and forget it'!
He must have never reached Navalgarh.
Must have dropped after drinking
on the way. And lost my letter!
l handed your own letter in your
very hands!
Did l or did l not?
- ln my hands!?
Did l not hand it to you?
- Let go of my hand.
l just fail to understand
this obsession of...
dispatching a letter to self and
receiving it by self at the other end.
No, brother.. what obsession !?
Brothers, shedding tears in front
of a blind man is useless.
lt will only make you lose your eyes.
- Am l blind? You are calling me blind?
15 days to go there!
15 days to come here!
My throat had run dry and
you didn't offer me water even.
How could l offer him water?
Was l here or was l there?
This is what l too want to ask.
Were you here or were you there?
lf you are here than who was that?
And if you were there than who are you?
- Who am l!? He's asking me who l am.
Just see brother...
everyone knows l am Kishanlal.
You're Kishanlal?
- Yes.
Then he too is Kishanlal.
l am also Kishanlal.
He is also Kishanlal and even he
is Kishanlal. All of us are Kishalal.
Happy?
All are Kishanlal?
Yes, l have to go.
Brother is coming to take me along.
Leaving me alone!? Where? Why?
What why?
The third lunar day of these monsoons
would be the first after my wedding.
And it is a tradition to celebrate
it at one's maternal home.
No, no! l don't believe in such
meaningless traditions!
And without asking me?
- But, mother has given her consent.
How can mother...
Let her say anything,
but how can you not ask me...
Coming, mother!
- Again calling for mother!
Hey!
Will you go leaving me behind?
Coming.
Say it then, you will never go
anywhere leaving me behind.
l won't go.. l will never go,
l will go no where.
What happened, daughter-in-law?
Whom are you talking to?
- Nothing, that...
Sir...
we have to visit Purabmal
early in the morning.
Velvet and silk has arrived
from across the border.
Better catch some sleep.
Uncle Jeevraj, it has been 8 months...
of the new bride arriving
in this house...
and you never visited even once.
Greetings, Kisan.
- Greetings, Jeevraj kaka.
So long no see!
Hope everything is fine.
What to say? Forget about me.
l have brought such beautiful
bangles for the new bride...
that you won't stop looking at them.
How do l look?
Just like a pretty Doll.
Buy some bangles for Bhabhi as well.
- No way.
These ordinary bangles
won't suit her.
One would require the seven colours
of the rainbow to make bangles for her.
Come.
Bhabhi, special bangles are
being made for you.
Come, Bhabhi, take as many bangles
as you wish to take.
''The bangles...''
''Made from the colours of the rainbow!''
''The bangles..''
''Made from the colours of the rainbow.''
''Their tinkling should echo
all over the house.''
''Their tinkling should echo
all over the house.''
''When the bangles tinkle
and the wristlets jingle...''
''they should wake the beloved up.''
''The bangles...''
''When the bangles tinkle
and the wristlets jingle...''
''..they should wake up the beloved.''
''The bangles..''
''The wristlets don't tinkle unwillingly.''
''They don't chime without a plea.''
''The bangles hum a tune.''
''The wristlets don't
tinkle unwillingly.''
''They don't chime without a plea.''
''They pacify those who are annoyed.''
''None of these shades please me.''
''l don't like anything that
you have chosen.''
''Bangles, made of glass are breakable.''
''And those made from lac wither away.''
''l would need the bangles
made from the iris.''
''The iridescent bangles.''
''Let me tie it from one end while
you take care of the other.''
''And we will tie a swing of
the seven shades to colour the skies.''
''The bangles...''
''The wristlets don't tinkle unwillingly.''
''They don't chime without a plea.''
''They hum a sweet tune...''
''to convince those who are upset.''
''The drums..''
''The drums..''
''The dark night of separation
doesn't end.''
''All the colours of life are lost
in this shade of separation.''
''The drums..''
''Only when l get to see my beloved...''
''would l deck up in ivory bangles.''
''All the colours of life are lost
in this shade of separation.''
''The drums...''
''The hurricanes swirl around like
bees over the vast desert expanse.''
''Fill them your arms.''
''l will get you the jewellery made
of flowers, if you so wish.''
''Let the fragrance spread
from your embellishments.''
''Those flowers would feel
like thorns to me.''
''Let us weave a garland of pearls
made of the teardrops.''
''Colour the pearls with
the colours of the iris.''
''The bangles...''
''The wristlets don't
tinkle unwillingly.''
''They don't chime without a plea.''
lf you've come to seek something,
forget about getting it.
Sir is in a horrible mood.
Greetings, Sir.
Our Ram Lakhan have grown up.
Ram Lakhan !?
Whose kids are they?
- Our camels', sir.
They have grown up.
So, what should l do?
- Sir..
your permission is needed for their
participation in this year's race.
ldiot, try at least to speak sense
first thing in the morning?
Kisna suggested it, sir. Pardon me.
But Chhote Malik (the younger master)
said that...
Chhote Malik?
He's still fast asleep, right?
Well, he's expected any moment.
What did he say?
He said that our Ram and Lakhan run
faster than the wind.
Let alone the experienced riders,
they will win this year's race...
..with kids riding over their back.
- Yes.
Sunderlal also took the responsibility
on the same premise.
And went away after losing.
He left even his young wife
and infant behind.
lt's been seven years..
of life filled with...
the embarrassment of
losing the race...
and the pain of separation
from my younger brother.
You dare mention 'race' again and...
You have decided to abstain from
attending rituals, is it?
My respects.
Races, my foot!
There is not a single camel in all
of nearby villages...
that can match up to our
Ram and Lakhan.
Grant me an opportunity to...
..get rid of the disgrace of loss.
Father...
only your blessings are needed now.
And, yes...
Who knows? Maybe uncle Sunder
might come back...
after hearing the news of our
winning the race.
Done!
Done!
Just see how time flies!
Master will be mighty pleased with...
the way you have made his
investments flourish.
Father will...
Two years, Mangi kaka!
Sometimes l feel the family
has forgotten me.
No letter, no message, nothing at all.
lf the situation persists...
l might end up forgetting even
the taste of my mother's food.
Uncle...
- Yes?
Better make a trip
to Navalgarh yourself.
Bring atleast some news from there.
Gone crazy? l will be killed!
He will demand an explanation for
neglecting my duties..
by leaving you alone.
You can go on the pretext of handing
over all this money to him, can't you?
lnstead of looking out for pretexts...
might as well write to him
and take his permission.
Then we both will go together.
Yes.
- Yeah !
Right away.
Respected father...
Just check who is there.
Who is it?
l heard you're going
to Shekhawati tomorrow.
Got to dispatch this letter
to Navalgarh, to my home.
lt's an important letter.
Make no mistake this time around.
We've kept the wheat bag inside.
- For you.
And bring an immediate reply from sir.
- Here, take it.
You didn't offer me water even,
last time.
But how could l..
- Please leave now!
Let's go, sir.
What are you doing?!
Hey!
What are you doing?!
Neither will you go to Navalgarh,
nor will you deliver any letter...
to anyone!
- Hey! Why?!
After calling you a drunkard in front
of the whole community...
who wants a bread earned out of
compromising our dignity?
Wanted to ask something more, father.
Sure, go ahead!
With your kind permission,
l was thinking of constructing...
a water well with a travellers'
inn adjacent to it...
for the benefit of village folks.
- Shucks!
Sir, talking of spending money,
the first thing in the morning!?
Seems the imprudence of
the whole world...
has been ordained to my Krishnalal.
Till date we are required to slog...
to collect revenues from the villagers.
And here this guy seems to have
totally lost his head.
But you said that my coming back
has proved auspicious.
The rates of silver have
risen sharply...
and even the business is prospering,
isn't it?
So?
There's something l need
to tell you, father..
Good wishes and blessings of
the deprived souls...
multiplies a hundred times.
Phutarmal...
How many hands would the Lord have?
- May be a 100.
Here you are! When those 100 hands
of the Lord...
couldn't do any good for the deprived
ones what difference are your two...
hands going to make?
- Easy, father. Easy.
Here!
Very naughty.
That you should be fondly remembered
even after the passage of a century...
or more, that's why l'm insisting
on constructing a well, father.
Moreover... you did promise that sage..
that from the five coins everyday..
What's this mention of five coins
every now and then?
Keep quiet, Kanwarlal!
And l am really pleased to hear about
your consent for the race.
Did l give my consent?
We will make both Ram and Lakhan
participate in the race.
One will have to win, anyhow.
Kids, applause!
All of you have united.
Father, with your permission..?
- Go, son.
You've got to construct the well. Go.
But one will not find a single
spot in the village...
where one can strike water.
Applause!
This is the second time that
Mr. Kanwarlal has said something wise.
Get some sweets for him.
Uncle Kanwar...
just trust me and say 'yes'.
Yes.
And father, l am sure
of striking water...
at the spot that l have identified.
Don't spend a single penny...
if he doesn't get water.
But striking water is certain.
And we will win the race, for sure.
Uncle Kanwar has agreed.
lsn't it, father?
Seems everyone has gone nuts.
Come along. We would have together
prayed for our wishes to be granted.
Only if l had any wishes!
Hope and faith lead
to fulfilment of vows.
l've seen it happening.
What's the need to ask God to compel
someone to return...
when he had gone out of his
own free will.
Better you go. For you, it's just
the beginning of life.
lt's been two years of marriage.
Be merciful on my dear daughter-in-law.
And grant a suitable groom and
nice in-laws to this crazy...
daughter of mine.
Grant everyone's wishes!
Make their dreams come true!
The last camel race brought
a storm along with it.
Clear all the fog this time around.
Protect the prestige of my family!
Look there, Kanwarlal is coming.
ls he here as a mere spectator
or is he competing?
Well, is a trader's camel
meant to compete?
Don't worry. We'll handle it.
Wait! Behold it from far.
Let him see it to his
heart's content.
Anyway, we are going to claim
it as a prize.
The poor boy won't get a chance
to see it for another year.
Have a nice look at it, dear.
- Hey... where is your uncle?
Look there!
Kanwarlal is right.
We should let Banwari and Phutarmal...
ride the camels instead of them.
- But, Banwari and Phutarmal!?
Keep quiet. You're not aware of
Hari Singh's guile.
Your father had fallen prey to the same
deceit of his in the last race!
But this time we won't
let that happen !
You go!
You too move!
Go back!
Both of you have to ride the camels!
- No!
But...
- lt's a matter of the family's prestige.
Greetings!
- Greetings!
Bhanwarlal-ji
Really glad to see you after
so many years.
lt's not something trivial, friends.
The lord and the master of a family
whose camel left the race midway...
and whose own brother showed
his back to him...
needs real courage to participate
again in such a event.
Courage! lsn't it?
Here, Lajju... go and put
this necklace...
around Arjun's neck even
before he wins.
And whisper this in his ear that after
being victorious...
he will get another
magnificent reward.
A pearl necklace in the camel's neck.
Arjun isn't a camel.
He is like my son, rather.
Arjun ! We have got to win !
Bless you, Arjun ! Bravo, my child!
Banwari, c'mon ! Banwari, c'mon !
Phutarmal, buck up!
Turn, Banwari!
Banwari! Turn !
Banwari.. turn back or else l'll
make life difficult for you !
Run !
Run !
C'mon, Banwari.. buck up! Keep going!
BANWARl!!!
Phutarmal!
They fell off!
What's happened to them all
of a sudden?
Come! Come, Banwari!
They were running so well!
Don't know what went wrong?
l'll see to it!
Run, Arjun ! Arjun, run !
Keep going.
Keep going.
How dare the Thakurs hit Kisna
despite you all being there?!
Sister, we were busy celebrating
when they took advantage...
You quietly endured it then.
What's the use of screaming now?
lt's not a serious injury anyway.
But l just don't understand what
Kisna's fault was?
Hey! lnstead of congratulating me
for victory, you are scolding me?
Listen... listen... listen...
lnstead of nursing my wounds
you are snubbing me.
Give me the reason of your silence,
at least.
l thought you too would be happy
with our winning the race.
Ok, it was my mistake, forgive me.
Want me to do sit-ups?
l won't spare those Thakurs!
Lachho... Lachho!
What was the need to show your spells?
l have totally forgotten that...
Please don't remind me that
you are a ghost
Don't do any such thing which
might remind me...
of you not being a human.
What if everyone gets to know of it?
You know everyone was discussing this...
that there was some witchcraft
during the race.
Lachho, let people talk anything
they wish to.
But they can never prove it.
Sit down.
And see the 'Turban' is back
in the mansion.
What if we had pay for it
with our relationship?
Please don't do any such thing.
You are under my oath !
Under an oath of my love.
No, Lachho.
l won't do it.
l'll never do it.
This is the punishment
to make me cry.
What are you doing?
And this is the punishment
of loving me so much.
Lachho!
Where are you lost, Seth-ji?
ln your wife's memory?
Tomorrow or the day after...
send in some berries while passing by.
- What?
Mangi kaka likes them.
Here... l'll keep them right away.
Okay... here you account is settled.
Manager, just wait.
They are so nice, aren't they?
Get me a handful.
Berries?
ls this something worth eating?
lt's meant for animals.
''The eyes are blank without you.''
''Where are you lost?''
''The eyes are blank without you.''
''Where are you lost?''
''ln those blanks of the eyes...''
''burns a flickering flame of your
separation, all night long.''
''The eyes are blank without you.''
''Where are you lost?''
''When the dusk sets in...''
''shadows of your memories
start wandering.''
''lt has been days that l have spoken
to the moon about you.''
''Do you remember those berries?''
''The eyes are blank without you.''
''Where are you lost?''
Lachho! Lachho!
Mother! Mother, look what's
wrong with Lachho!?
Aunt!
- What's wrong!?
What happened?
- Get aside, Kisan. Let us see.
Get aside. Get aside.
Sit... sit, Lachho.
What happened, daughter-in-law?
- l felt giddy.
What are you staring at, standing here?
Go and ask your father to distribute...
sweets in the village.
She is expecting.
We will have to protect her
from the evil eye.
Rakma, you are going to become an aunt
and l would be a granny now.
ln what play of nature are you stuck?
Don't worry.
Celebrate, rather.
His life has been fruitful.
Even if he isn't there
his lineage will continue.
A lineage of their love.
The seed of Lachchi's love...
and the inheritance of
a spirit's affection.
The legacy of Lachchi's beauty...
- Enough, dear.
What when the real husband comes back?
Just think what all will Lachhi
have to go through?
And what will happen to the offspring?
Send the news to her maternal home...
along with the sweets.
Only if he could have his way,
he would go flying away...
to deliver the news.
Come, inside.
Let's go.
- C'mon, Lachchi.
Where have l reached walking
alongside you !
l too wonder the same.
Had l not been to the pond that day...
how would l have spent
these many years.
How else? By wearing silk...
and relishing the delicacies.
Yeah, you would have learnt accounts.
l'm leading such a strange life.
Maybe l'll never know
as to what you are to me.
Do you know this relation of ours...
ls unbreakable.
What are you doing!?
This image of yours...
never crossed my mind.
Only a woman makes a man complete.
You are saying this because
you are a ghost.
Had you been a human being, you would
have never said anything so nice.
Sit for a while.
Should l ask for something more?
From me?
- Yeah.
Give me a daughter, if possible.
l also need a daughter.
As if a son would guarantee us
a place in the heaven.
l agree.
A daughter who brings
light in our lives.
Ujariya.
We will name her as 'Ujariya' (light).
Ujariya?
- Yes.
Ujaali (light).
- Ujaali!?
Ujaali (light).
That's fine as well.
Ujaali! Fine!
The one whose glow would light up
all the directions.
Ujaali!
Kisan Bhaiyya... we have struck water!
We have hit upon water!
At the same spot that you suggested!
The whole village is blessed.
As if the river 'Looni' has
sprung in the village.
Let's go and tell everyone!
Auspicious signs of our
daughter's arrival?
Yes.
Listen...
We will name our daughter 'Looni Ma.'
Looni Ma?
''The water has sprung to life.''
''The water is showering abound.''
''The earth isn't barren anymore.''
''lt is lush with greenery now.''
''The vessels and the ponds
are filled.''
''And so are the maiden's eyes.''
''The water has sprung to life.''
''The water is showering abound.''
''The flowers bloom and
celebrate in joy.''
''The bushes and the barren land
appear contended and cheerful.''
''The water has sprung to life.''
''A new moment has risen from
this perishable body.''
''The future has taken birth from
the womb of time.''
''The water has sprung to life!''
''Another moment is born !''
''lt has sprung to life at
an opportune time.''
''The water has sprung to life.''
''The water is showering abound.''
''lt was a drop of dew resting
on your eyelashes.''
''Not yours but it was a strange
dream of mine, sweetheart!''
''Wake up from your dream as it
has turned to reality.''
''The dream resting in your
eyes has come true.''
''Time which rested in your eyes
has risen now.''
''The dream has arisen !''
''A moment is born !''
''lt has sprung to life at
an opportune time.''
''The water has sprung to life.''
''The water is showering abound.''
Gone crazy?
What are you talking?
Pardon me, sir.
But your wife is expecting.
She must have already
delivered by now.
How can she deliver?
- Easy. Easy.
What crap is he talking?
Take this fool away.
C'mon ! C'mon !
''May you have an abundance of life's
blessings under the shade...
of the nurturing sky!''
''And the house should forever echo
with the jingling of kids' toys.''
''May your lap never remain empty!''
''May your nuptials remain everlasting!''
''May you enjoy matrimonial
bliss for eternity!''
''The water has sprung to life.''
''The fruits are bearing.''
''For once it has struck the full moon !''
''The fruits are bearing.''
''The water has sprung to life.''
Hey! Who are you !?
Kanwar kaka, who is he?
Who are you?
Father... l am your Kishan.
Who is he?
Banwari!
Banwari, call the midwife urgently.
But there are still two months to go.
Go, Banwari!
Seems the child wants to take
birth in this very house.
That's why even before leaving for
her maternal home...
Aunt...
There's nothing to worry, child.
The moment the midwife arrives,
everything will be fine...
Aunt...
Why are you looking at me
like that, aunt?
l'm Kisna. Your Kisna.
Aunt! Aunt!
Go inside, sister.
Near the daughter-in-law.
You go in.
What drama is this?
Who are you?
Where have you come from?
- l've come from Jamnagar, father!
l'm your son !
- Shut up!
And go away from here!
Come, son. Let's go in.
Father!
Father, l...
l'm Kishan...
How can you be Kishan?
Uncle... l'm indeed Kishan.
- Even your manner of speaking...
is the same.
- How else would it be?
Mother...
Even you fail to recognise the one
whom you have given birth.
This...
Mother, go and ask your
daughter-in-law...
about the berry incident...
she'll tell you everything.
These... l plucked them myself.
Go and ask her at least.
ls this any time to ask
about berries?
She is fighting with death there
and he is talking about berries.
What the heck!
ls she an ignorant fool
to eat berries?
And if you are Kisna, where is
Mangilal? Why didn't he come along?
Answer him.
Who would have taken care
of business at Jamnagar?
You? l mean... you, uncle?
Banwari!
Kisna never retorts and here
you are, arguing with elders?
Why don't you say anything, child?
What's the need for my Kishanlal
to say anything?
And you imposter!
lf your self respect is dear to you...
better leave right away or else...
l said go!
Father...
- Get lost.
Mother... l am Kishan... mother.
Get lost from here with your berries!
Just get out.
lnstead of questioning that imposter,
you are questioning me.
Father, look. Just have a look.
Here is your daughter-in-law's ring.
How can it be with me?
- How do l know!?
Then go and ask her, father!
When we were returning after
the wedding, she had given...
this ring to me.
Better ask her. What's the harm?
O God! Two men with similar faces?
lt's the bad omen of the Dark Age.
What drama is this!?
- Shut up!
This is our internal matter!
We'll settle it ourselves!
No need for the villagers to poke
their nose in between.
Whom should we trust!?
Don't know who is right and who is not.
He must have come in greed of wealth.
Get lost, all of you !
Kishanlal, go inside.
- Yes, father.
Not you !
You go inside, Kishanlal!
Didn't l ask you to go?
Lachchi child, the midwife is saying...
- No!
Listen, Lachchi... listen...
What's the matter?
- The child's stuck inside!
The midwife is advising an operation.
Or it would endanger Lachchi's life.
Let me meet her once.
Uncle Kanwar, that thug has
entered our mansion...
and you people are...
- He is worried about his wife.
He isn't like you.
Kanwarlal, there's no need
to explain anything to this imposter.
Rakma... take them inside!
Lachho...
my Lachho...
Never leave me.
l take an oath on our Looni Ma...
no power in the world can...
separate me from you.
From both of you.
lf this precedent of having
two husbands is set...
the traditions will go for a toss.
lt might not be a big deal
for people like you...
but life would become
miserable for the poor?
The point is of justice, Bhanwar Seth.
Everything should be crystal clear.
When does one get a chance to disgrace
the rich and the mighty?
lt is something rare.
Just see, everyone will start
talking relentlessly now.
And that devil with the berries just
don't know what vengeance he holds.
Ask the Seth to fill his
mouth with money.
Or else things would go beyond control.
No matter what power
the money possesses...
it can never hire four shoulders
to carry the bier.
Justice should be meted out.
- Yes
Or the whole community
will be disgraced.
No one knows who the real one is.
One has to be proved a fake.
Since that camel race,
l have been suspicious.
What race, brother?
What would you gain by disgracing me?
We live like brothers.
And we help each others
in times of need.
Everyone has been benefited
because of my son.
You are full of praises for his work.
Father...
- This berry guy is the imposter.
Kick him out of here!
No, uncle...
Trust me! l'm your Kishan !
l am... Kishan !
Congratulations, brother-in-law!
lt's a girl.
The ladyluck has smiled on this house.
Both the mother and the child are fine.
Mother!
What's the matter?
- Mother, father has come back.
What!?
- Yes!
And, sister Rakma was saying that...
Come here, son !
Come here!
Forgive me if possible...
Please forgive me.
Come... come here...
Sunder kaka, there is so much
to call our own.
Don't lose them ever.
The moments of life just slip by.
This can't be settled without
the intervention of the King.
Better produce them to the King.
Yes, let the King decide.
Yeah, sure.
Kindly consider my plea.
Allow me to see my daughter
before going.
What's the hurry?
Once the justice is imparted,
you have all the time to be with her.
That's right!
What's happening here...?
Brother, only God knows what is
in store for me.
But, you very well know that,
l am Seth Bhanwarlal's real son.
So who are you after all?
Real... unreal! Truth and untruth !
We have such hollow beliefs.
Hey, what rubbish are you talking?
Tell me the truth !
Did you marry her at the wedding altar?
Did you take the seven marital vows?
What difference do the vows make?
The plea of marriage doesn't last
for the lifetime.
What revenge are you seeking from me?
For God's sake, tell me,
who you are?
l?
l am the yearning that resides in
a woman's heart... that's who l am.
l'm the love she wants
Love?
- Hey, keep going.
Did you hear?
He said he is 'love.'
Where are so many people heading to?
For some feast?
- We are going to the King.
To the King?
- Yes.
For what?
- For justice!
Justice!? What justice?
What will you do with it?
You won't understand a bit of it.
May be.
But l might settle the issue
right here.
O' King of kings...
kindly give way and let us go.
Go, sirs!
But isn't it possible that a needle
can pull off something...
which the sword can't achieve?
Look... look at both of them.
- Who?
Get aside.
Aren't they identical?
O gosh !
Aren't they identical?
- Of course, they are.
Then who's the real one?
- What's the issue of the real...
and the duplicate?
Must be twins.
The justice is done.
l mean what's the problem if they
are identical?
The problem is, l have only one son.
And my daughter-in-law too has
only one spouse.
Such a petty issue...
and none of you could solve
this problem?
Everyone's set for a march
to the King's palace!
What's this?
Both look so similar as if they
are reflections in the mirror.
Brother... brother...
Are both of them dumb and deaf?
- Not at all.
On the contrary, both have
a gift of the gab.
Then just ask them
who the fake one is.
Brother, we're done with this
nincompoop's justice.
Kanwarlal... had he been so wise,
he wouldn't have been a shepherd.
Got it! Got it!
They know how to talk but they have
learnt the art of lying as well.
No problem! No problem at all!
Hold this.
lt's a piece of cake for me to get
the truth out! Get aside!
l'll solve this riddle in a jiffy!
What's he doing?
The one who will hold this
burning coal on his palm...
with be the real son.
This is... this is absolute
injustice, father!
And you? Do you think you are
the revered saint Valmiki...
that you are putting us
to a test of fire?
Now let me see...
Father!
Father, let this shepherd say anything.
But l am your real son.
Bravo, courageous boy!
Who else can dare to do that
other than the real son !?
These fools needlessly harassed you !
But, sir, what matters is the
satisfaction of the heart, isn't it?
Come... come, buddy...
let me put you to another test.
Come... you also come.
Come and join him here.
Look... before my seventh clap...
the one who can gather all my sheep...
is the real husband of the bride.
Fine?
- Yes.
Yes?
- Yes!
Run ! Hey, fell down.
Move.
- Kishanlal... hurry up.
Kishanlal!
Listen, the test should be such
which a trader can face.
What else would a trader know
but to calculate?
Six... seven
Caught.
- Well done.
Who else can have this courage
and ability other than...
the real husband?
But why should there be even
an iota of doubt left?
Let us put them to one more test.
The last and the final.
Father...
- Keep it down here!
The final test!
Kanwarlal, this shepherd
is wasting our time.
Yes!
Before the seventh snap of the finger...
the real husband of the bride...
will enter into this waterbag!
You shepherd, have you gone mad!?
ln that water bag...
Father...
That one would be the real
lover of the bride.
Never do anything that would remind
me of your not being a human being.'
'Of not being a human being!'
'You are under my oath !
Under the oath of my love!'
l will have to break the oath, Lachho.
lt's the test of my love!
lt's a trial in front of the world!
Wait, don't fall for this
shepherd's trap.
Don't trust a human being.
- He is digging his own grave.
You don't have any idea of how
deceitful human beings are.
Listen to me...
- Don't do a thing like this!
That's it.
Justice was delayed indeed...
but wasn't it fair?
Got him!
Father...
- May that ghost rot in hell.
He covered my eyes with gold...
and, Kanwarlal, l couldn't
even identify my own son !
Bless you, my son !
Come...
- Here.. take it.
And this...
- No, brother!
l'm no king to seek a price
for imparting justice.
You had a problem and l solved it.
Keep it.
lt would help buy food for your cattle.
Sir... come here...
My cattle are real fools, just like me.
They merrily eat grass...
but don't even sniff gold.
These useless things are fit for
rich people like you.
For me... my stick suits the best.
Give it to me, buddy!
''The midnight moon...''
''remembers everything.''
''Despite being awake in the dreams...''
''No doubt the face is one...''
''But l call out for two names.''
''All l get to speak is with
the sand-dunes.''
But why are you so worried?
We were the ones who had
given him birth.
When we couldn't identify him...
how could you have possibly done so?
For us...
you're still the same daughter who...
entered this house as
the daughter-in-law.
Everything will be fine.
You are not at fault, child.
And it's not even the fault
of the newborn.
''The eyes are blank without you.''
''Where are you lost?''
God only knows how many lives...
l would be required to live.
All l can pray for you is that...
you get the strength to face
life and take your decisions.
Lachchi...
only l know...
how l had spent these four years...
and how every night
passed for me!
And then just think...
let me lift this veil...
Thinking that...
Before starting life
afresh with you...
l've got to fulfill
an obligation.
Want to tell you something.
l know it! l know it!
That wretch cast his spell...
- No!
Neither did he cast any spell,
nor did he try to deceive me.
He told me everything.
The whole truth !
l had faced that
moment of dilemma.
l trusted his love and truthfulness...
and consented for the relationship.
The love... the respect that
l got from him...
will be hard to forget.
Now how can l start a new
life with you?
How can l possibly love you?
You left a part of your other
life, downstairs?
Didn't bring Ujaali with you?
Her name isn't Ujaali.
l know it! l know it!
That we will address her as Looni Ma...
is what we had decided...
on the day when the water
was found, isn't it?
Looni Ma...
Wasn't this the decision
we both took?
But everyone told me that...
the shepherd captured the ghost
in the waterbag.
Huh !
l entered it with my own free will.
Since l had to prove my love!
lf the shepherd really had the power
to separate us...
it was a child's play
for me to enter...
your husband's body in order
to be with you all my life.
Moreover, l had taken an oath
on my daughter...
of not separating
from both of you.
Now will we ever separate?
Never!
Never for a moment!
l'll keep you tied to me, always.
This way their love continued
to shower with the clouds.
Kept sparkling with the stars.
And continued to rise in the form of
the sun and the moon.
But this is a very old tale!
As old as a night filled with stars!
''The night passed away giving way to
the day and the day to the night.''
''And love bloomed with each
passing night.''
''lt's an eternal love story!''
''When the moon travels beyond
the passing camels...''
''and the night progresses along
with the moon...''
''with stars following
in a procession...''
''lt's an eternal love story!''
''The story continues every night.''
- ''The wind narrates a tale.''
''And at times people recount it.
lt's an eternal love story!''
''The night passed away giving way to
the day and the day to the night.''
''And love bloomed with each
passing night.''
''lt's an eternal love story!''
''The body shall cease to exist.
- But, love shall be ever-lasting.''
''Time shall pass away, brother.
''But the folklore will survive beyond
time.''
''The body shall cease to exist.
- But, love shall be ever-lasting.''
''Time shall pass away, brother.
''But the folklore will
survive beyond time.''
''lt would become ancient with
the passage of time.
''But the names shall be immortal.''
''Their names will continue to be
mentioned till such time the sand...
exists in the deserts.''
''The night passed away giving way
to the day and the day to the night.''
''And love bloomed with each
passing night.''
''lt's an eternal love story!''
''Years passed by!
When many moons had set...''
''a halt was made at the Pipal
tree and love was born.''
''Years passed by!
When many moons had set...''
''a halt was made at the Pipal
tree and love was born.''
''Ever since they appear
in all love stories.''
''Their names will continue to be
mentioned till such time the sand...
exists in the deserts.''
''The night passed away giving way to
the day and the day to the night.''
''And love bloomed with
