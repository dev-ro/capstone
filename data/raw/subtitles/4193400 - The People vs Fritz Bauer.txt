Today Germany is proud
of its economic miracle.
It's also proud to be the
home of Goethe and Beethoven.
But Germany is also the
country of Hitler, Eichmann
and their numerous
accomplices and followers.
But as the day consists of day AND night,
so the history of every nation
has its bright and dark sides.
I believe that the younger
generation in Germany is ready
to learn about the complete
history, the whole truth,
which on occasion can prove to be
difficult to process for their parents.
Dr Bauer?
I'm here to deliver your groceries.
Shall I sort and shelve them?
...merchant shipping. But also
the air freight service...
Your car will be ready at 7 am. tomorrow. If
you need me earlier, feel free to contact me.
Have a nice evening.
Doctor?
Doctor?
Doctor...
Doctor!
Doctor!
Help! Help! We need help!
This doesn't look like an assassination.
It seems like the general consumed a
mixture of alcohol and sleeping pills.
How many sleeping pills?
- Two or three are missing.
If it were more, one might think
that he tried to kill himself.
You're right.
- Inspect the apartment thoroughly.
Kreidler?
Federal Criminal Police Office.
Kreidler?
- Good evening, Chief Prosecutor.
Your superior almost died today.
An assassination?
- No.
One could interpret it as
some kind of suicide attempt.
How is he?
He will recover.
But how long will we be able to
afford such an Attorney General?
A bit more pressure and the 1294 man
would... His seat would be empty.
Thank you, Gebhardt.
You're welcome. Have a nice evening.
I will.
We'll continue our conversation with
Mr Eichmann on the Jewish Question.
What would have been the best outcome
for this thing with the Jews?
I will be frank with you, Comrade Sassen,
if we had annihilated 10.3 million
of the 10.3 million Jews,
I would have been satisfied and said:
"Great, we annihilated an enemy."
Our duty for our blood, our nation,
the freedom of the people,
would have been fulfilled.
I, too, am to blame, that the elimination
of our enemy that I conceptualised,
could not have been entirely completed.
I was an insufficient mind.
Therein lies my fault.
When in reality I could have
and should have done more.
Good afternoon, Mr Attorney General.
I don't want to talk about it.
But thank you anyway.
Fritz!
- Mr Minister-President, what an honour.
- I wanted to visit you.
Well, that's nice of you.
But it's not worth the hassle.
You could have called.
Sit down, we have to talk.
Could you give us a moment, please?
There are rumours, Fritz.
What rumours?
That you tried to take your own life.
It's been a long time since
I slept without chemicals.
As your employer I can't turn
a blind eye to these rumours.
I own a pistol.
When I want to end my own life,
there will be no rumours.
Dr Bauer! I'm pleased to see you in
good health. I heard about your mishap.
No worries, Kreidler, I'm fine.
Really? You look pale.
You could use some fresh air.
Yes, actually you're right about that.
Come and visit me at my lodge.
Do you like hunting?
Yes, but not animals.
Was anyone in my room?
Not to my knowledge. Is something
missing again? - The Schneider file.
Please gather all Attorney Generals.
Now?
I just need the Special Department heads.
Please.
Good afternoon.
- Good evening, gentlemen. Please.
Thank you.
- Dr Bauer.
Thank you for finding time at this hour. As
you know I've been ill for the last few days.
Who wants a cigar?
No, thanks.
- Thanks.
No, thanks. I do not.
Fine.
How is the search for Bormann
and Mengele coming along?
Nothing new to report.
The search for Eichmann?
- Sadly nothing new on this matter, either.
Mr Kügler, Mr Vogel, do
you have anything new?
Well, erm...
- We were occupied with other cases.
There are no decisive developments.
How were we supposed to have any?
You were only ill for a week.
Yes, how was anything supposed to happen,
if nothing has happened in the
twelve years since the war?
Fine, thank you.
With all due respect, Dr
Bauer, was that everything?
What do you mean?
- Couldn't this have waited until Monday?
I am sorry, if I interrupted
your domestic bliss.
I don't have to apologise for wanting
to spend the evening with my children.
And I don't have to apologise for anything.
While I was absent, another file
disappeared from my office.
This time SS-Commander Schneider's, who
nowadays is openly working at Mercedes-Benz.
My own agency is enemy territory
and nothing gets done at all.
Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Dr Bauer?
I have Schneider's file.
You have it? - Yes. You asked for my
assessment of the evidence against him.
Why didn't you say so earlier?
I didn't want to expose you.
That makes you a rare exception,
Angermann. Thank you.
Good evening.
Switchboard, connect me with Copenhagen
please. The Tiefenthal family.
- Tiefenthal.
- Hello, Walter. - Hello?
It's Fritz. I'm not
interrupting anything am I?
Fritz? Hello! How are you?
Margot, it's your brother!
Thank you. Thank you, very good. And you?
All splendid.
Here she is.
- Fritz, how pleasant!
Margot, my dear.
Am I interrupting anything?
I... I just wanted to hear your voice.
Why? Have you received more death threats?
No, no. Everything is fine.
I... I'll probably make it to
Copenhagen for your birthday.
Oh, that would be nice. We would be glad.
Shall I invite your wife? That
way we'll all be together.
Yes, yes, feel free to invite her.
I'm looking forward to it.
Well, I have to get back to work, Margot.
Talk to you soon.
Good afternoon.
Three oranges.
- With pleasure.
Nick?
- Where is Nick?
- He's at the beach with a girl.
Why are you grinning?
- I think he likes her.
As long as he doesn't bring her here.
See you tomorrow.
Hello! Do we have any leftovers?
What is it?
Oh, good morning, Dr Bauer. I thought
you were already in Copenhagen.
I'm leaving for the airport now.
I just wanted to grab some work files.
Why don't you use the days to relax?
I'll be the first one who's able to
relax during a family celebration.
Good morning.
- Thank you. - My pleasure.
Oh, this one seems to be private.
Dear Mr Bauer, I'm writing
to you in the hope
that you will assist me in arresting a
man wanted for murder in multiple cases.
It's for you.
I have reason to assume
that Adolf Eichmann...
Dr Bauer?-... hides under a false name
in a suburb of Buenos Aires.
My daughter Silvia fell in love
with Eichmann's oldest son Nick.
I read in an Argentinian daily newspaper that
your agency is working on the Eichmann case.
Adolf Eichmann
was responsible for the transport of millions
of Jews from all over Europe to the camps,
in which they were murdered.
If you are interested in my information,
I look forward to your answer.
Yours sincerely, Hermann.
Please cancel my flight to Copenhagen
and connect me to my sister.
Hello?
- Fritz!
- Rosa Luxemburg?
You're a brave one. What's the Domestic
Intelligence Service's opinion on this?
They are probably still investigating
who she is. Come in. - Thank you.
Take a seat.
Thank you.
Brandy?
No, thank you.
A man named Lothar Hermann
believes, he has found Adolf
Eichmann in Argentina.
Obersturmbannführer of the SS,
head of department IV, B4 of the
Reich Security Head Office,
responsible for the
"resettlement" of the Jews.
The investigation file was
already opened in 1945.
Hm. And what do you want to do now?
To put him on trial in Germany.
Well, great.
But I don't know how.
I just don't know how.
Your holy wrath is good.
It keeps you young. - No!
My wrath is accompanied by powerlessness.
And that is what makes me age!
Without a doubt. What have I achieved?
The Hitler assassins are not considered traitors of
their country anymore, fine. But besides that? Nothing!
All investigations have stalled.
You know, after '45 I actually
believed, that we'd defeated the evil.
I thought we could build a new society:
free, just, fraternal.
But the people don't
even want such visions.
They want a nice single-family
home and a small car.
They want Adenauer's damned reconciliation!
The restoration defeated the revolution,
like so many times in Germany.
I can't breathe in here!
You knew it wouldn't be easy.
Eichmann, that would be a blow.
He was the central figure.
The organiser of the Final Solution.
He was the one pulling the strings.
It would keep many people up at night, if
we could put him on trial in Frankfurt.
I've contacted Interpol,
but they've said that they aren't
in charge of political crimes.
Each and every investigating authority
is infiltrated by National Socialists.
The BKA [Federal Criminal Police Office], the BND [Federal
Intelligence Service] and the Domestic Intelligence Service.
But you've got your crown attorneys.
Files are disappearing in my own agency.
Rome wasn't built in a day, either.
Back then when we fought for the SPD [Social Democratic
Party of Germany] in the streets of the Weimar Republic,
that was way more urgent than here,
in your comfy official mansion.
I made you Attorney General.
Put them on trial, but don't pity yourself.
In a few years Germany
will face its history.
If Eichmann manages to escape,
I won't have the strength left
for a few more years, Georg.
I'm going to contact Mossad.
That's treason.
I'm sure there are no
doubts about my patriotism.
If this goes public, you will go to jail.
- That is why I am only telling you about it.
I don't think this is a
wise decision, Fritz.
And how am I supposed to answer Lothar
Hermanns's letter, in your opinion?
You have a visitor. Herr
Gebhardt from the BKA.
Gebhardt. - Yes. Our friend
seems to be back on his feet.
Well.
Do you know why he cancelled
the trip to his sister's?
It's always for the same reason, Gebhardt.
He's obsessed.
Not everyone is equipped with ambition.
- All in its proper time, Gebhardt.
You are unflappable, but our friends
overseas don't have this luxury.
Whom are you thinking about?
I don't know exactly, that's my problem.
I don't know who Bauer is focused on.
He asked Interpol
if we can apprehend a Nazi officer with
an arrest warrant who is overseas.
Hmm. What was your answer?
"That we aren't responsible for
political crimes". - Correct.
He can't do anything, he's isolated.
Don't underestimate him.
What is that? Danish?
- Yes. - I can't read this.
It's a report from the Foreigners' Police. [German Police
section that deals with crimes committed by Germans abroad]
Bauer was caught on several occasions
with male prostitutes in Denmark.
Is he gay?
- Yes.
Oh.
The Jew is gay?
If we catch him with a random
guy, he is done for. - Exactly.
And even a monk has to
bust a nut sometimes.
May I?
Please.
Enjoy your meal, Angermann.
- Enjoy your meal.
Not that bad today.
- Yes, sure.
I am concerned about this case.
What is it about?
- A 175er.
A young medical student
called Johann Kraus.
He was denounced for his homosexuality
and sentenced to two and a half years in prison
because of "highly perverse sexual offences".
He lost his study permit. And now he's
been caught engaging in male prostitution.
He earned five Deutschmarks
for mutual onanism.
I'm not sure, which
sentence I should demand.
Six months in prison.
What's the problem?
Six months for mutual onanism?
You seem to be personally
offended by this, Angermann.
Because I am.
Only the Nazis made mutual
onanism a criminal offence.
But the Federal Court of Justice ruled
that the law does not embody any
National Socialist ideology.
Yes.
I have to leave.
Do you know about the Valentin verdict?
- No.
Hamburg Land court [County
Court], summer '51 or so.
It might interest you.
Welcome on board this DC-6
International Airline flight...
Please store your large hand luggage
safely under the seat in front of you...
Are there any messages for me?
No, Sir. No messages.
Thank you.
- Have a nice day.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
No!
- Who's there?
- Dr Bauer?
Yes?
- We're here to pick you up.
Okay. Please enter!
- Good morning.
- Hello. Just a moment, please.
You can take off the mask.
Please excuse the safety measures.
I'm sorry.
I don't understand Yiddish.
Harel. You can call me Isser.
Isser?
My name is Fritz. I didn't
expect to meet you in person.
It's not that we aren't
interested in Eichmann.
We've carried out two investigations.
This file contains everything
we managed to gather.
The lead is a dead end.
A dead end? It can't be.
I wish it were not.
The first investigation was
carried out by one of my men.
He didn't find anyone resembling Eichmann.
No Eichmann? And who is that?
This is Nick Eichmann's mother, Vera Leibl.
Vera Leibl-Eichmann, Eichmann's wife!
We carried out a second investigation.
Silvia Hermann managed to infiltrate
the house under false pretences.
She's a brave girl.
Silvia Hermann was in the house?
She confirmed, that a man of
Eichmann's age is living there
and that Nick calls him "Tate".
Nick calls him "Father".
- That's great!
But Vera Leibl supposedly
remarried after the war. - What?
- She remarried.
- I know.
I ordered an interrogation of her mother
and deemed her testimony implausible.
Vera Leibl supposedly remarried
and migrated with her new husband
and the Eichmann sons to America.
Allegedly, since then no one has
been in contact with the family.
They don't even know, if they're
in South or North America.
I don't believe that she remarried.
The homeowner is an Austrian.
- Eichmann IS an Austrian.
Francisco Schmidt.
We checked him out. He most
definitely isn't Eichmann.
And what is that?
The electricity meter is registered
under both of these names.
Electricity meter? Two tenants: "Klement"
and "Dagoto". Have you checked the names?
Adolf Eichmann robbed the
richest families of Europe.
Do you believe in all seriousness
that he's been living for
twelve years in this house?
This is our file on Eichmann.
One person claimed, he works in
Nasser's brain trust in Cairo.
Someone else claimed, he travels back and
forth between Africa and Switzerland.
And according to this one, he
lives in Kiel and breeds rabbits.
You should have checked the names on the
electricity meter: Klement and Dagoto.
I have to defend the living Jews
in Israel, not the dead ones.
You can have your letter back.
I'm sorry, but we can't help you.
Mossad is a small secret service.
I have to use my men
against our Arab enemies.
You speak German!
- Yes.
But I don't like to.
If you can find a second,
independent source,
that clearly says Eichmann
lives in Argentina,
I can continue the investigation.
- That can't be true!
- Order in the court room!
Order or I will clear the hall!
Attorney Angermann, please explain
to the court, how you got around
to demanding such an absurd sentence
for the accused Johann Kraus?
I refer to the Valentin verdict
of 21 June '51 in Hamburg,
in which Land Court director
Dr Valentin sentenced two men
in a similar case for three Deutschmarks
each for homosexual actions.
And due to the fact, that the accused
earned five Deutschmark for mutual onanism,
I deem a fine of five Deutschmarks just.
- Silence!
- If that's so anybody in here...
In the name of the people the
following judgment is given:
A five month prison sentence
for homosexual prostitution.
On top of that, the jury
imposes the constraint,
that the convict is prohibited from any
contact with men under the age of 21.
The trial is closed.
I want to thank you.
What for?
- I'm a friend of Johann Kraus.
But you saw for yourself, the inhuman
verdict I was able to arrange for him.
What you have done took a lot of courage.
For this...
I want to thank you.
Come and visit me some time.
- In the "Kokett"? I don't think...
Good morning, Miss Schütt. Did something
interesting happen in my absence?
Oh yes, a small scandal.
Angermann demanded a fine of FIVE
Deutschmarks at the Land Court for a 175er.
The judge was furious. But I
guess you can imagine that.
Yes...
I can.
Mr Angermann.
Dr Bauer, greetings.
- Good evening.
I heard about your petition
for a scandalous sentence.
Because of the five Deutschmarks?
- A real "Heiermann", as they say.
For immoral homosexual prostitution.
You dared!
Chief prosecutor Kreidler
deems it a scandal.
And I deem it a scandal that
Kreidler is chief prosecutor.
I have something to discuss with you. Can
you make Saturday at my place? -Saturday?
It's a confidential matter that I
don't want to discuss in the office.
On Saturday our new kitchen will
be delivered. Is Sunday an option?
All right. 11 o'clock?
- Sure.
Ah, Angermann!
Good afternoon, Dr Bauer. - Good afternoon.
Coffee?
- Gladly.
Take off your coat.
Yes.
Tchaikovsky.
"Symphonie Pathétique".
My favourite.
Yes, nice. What's the matter, Dr Bauer?
Your wife will pull through, Angermann.
Sorry. She's very catholic
and today is Sunday.
How long have you been married?
- Two years.
Children
?
- No. - Why not?
Why do you want to talk to me?
Read this.
What do you want to do?
I contacted Mossad.
They asked for a second, independent source,
confirming Eichmann is in Argentina,
before starting an operation.
Do you know "Der Weg"? [The Way]
It's a right-wing propaganda
paper from Buenos Aires.
I want you to figure out, if this
name is Adolf Eichmann's pseudonym.
What will Mossad do, if
we find a second source?
Abduct Eichmann and put him on
trial, I believe. What do you think?
I think this would be treason.
The BND is our executive.
But the BND knows, where these people hide.
And the CIA probably too.
At best they would warn Eichmann.
- I'm not so sure about that.
Even though the BND employs
a lot of ex-Nazis,
it has to follow Adenauer's policy. And
Adenauer wants reconciliation with Israel.
Maybe he would be alright with a
big trial against a war criminal.
Are you serious?
Eichmann would give up countless people
who were connected to the Final Solution,
maybe even state secretary Hans Globke.
Adenauer wants to restore Germany's reputation,
but he won't sacrifice his right hand for that.
Globke controls the chancellery, the BND, the Domestic Intelligence
Service and the CDU [Christian Democratic Union political party].
His name would be connected
to the deportations,
only because of his legal
comment on the Nuremberg Laws.
Globke dirtied his hands.
Globke's fall would pose a threat
for the whole Adenauer government.
And if Adenauer has a problem,
the USA have a problem.
No one from Bonn [West German capital]
to Washington wants Eichmann on trial.
Treason can't be the solution.
- Goddammit, Angermann!
Do you want justice or just a new kitchen?
If we want to do something for our country,
we have to betray it in this case.
I have to think about this.
Well, forget it.
It seems I was wrong.
Go home. Install your new stove.
I hope you bought a German product.
Do you believe you can convince
me like that to commit treason?
You sound just the way
your enemies depict you:
A vengeful man!
- Oho, oho!
Show no constraint! You
mean like a vengeful JEW!
How dare you, Angermann?
I dare to be a friend of yours. Good day.
Today's audience is very young.
But please don't hold back.
Open the eyes of these young folks!
Don't spare our audience. Please.
In university I devoured his works!
Back in the day he was so optimistic...
Oh!
Our guests will be here soon.
- We still have some time.
I can't.
Don't, please don't. I...
I can't right now.
I can't... Are you listening to me? I
got in an argument with the general.
What are you afraid of? Losing your job?
- No!
Yes, that too.
My brother would be happy
and you would earn more.
Don't get started with that. I don't
want to work as a defence lawyer!
Your call. As long as we don't have
children, we can manage with this.
Actually there are attorneys with children!
- Yes? Then ask them how you make them. [the children]
Karl.
- Good evening, Hans.
The kitchen is beautiful. Thank you
again, that was very generous of you.
Don't thank me. Fill this
house with life already.
That's sheer madness!
- Great, isn't it? It turned out fantastic.
Hey, little angel!
- Thank you! - Satisfied?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen and
welcome to our talk in the Basement Club.
Attorney General Bauer...
- Ingrid! It's starting!
...will face questions
from our young audience.
In a moment, the discussion will begin.
Dr Bauer,
what can one still be proud of as a German?
I'm not sure, if I understood the question correctly.
- People like you run Germany down for us.
How are we supposed the gather
the energy and the interest,
to build something up in this country?
That was not my intention.
You know, when I returned
for the first time
to Germany after the war, I travelled
with a young man in a train.
Karl!
He told me about himself...
- Hmm!
Your superior, right?
- Yes.
- ...about his hopes...
Charlotte! - I would like to
see this too, little angel.
Oh, the general in the Basement?
That will be interesting.
And I thought to myself: "For this
generation it would be worth it,
to permanently return to
Germany from abroad."
But if you ask me,
as a person, then I have to tell you:
It seems to me,
that the walls are caving
in on me from everywhere.
And you have to support them, and there and there
too, because everything is caving in on me.
But can't we be proud of our
democratic constitution?
Look...
I believe, us Germans
can't be proud of our
forests or our mountains,
because we didn't work for them.
Also we can't be proud
of Goethe and Schiller
and also not of Einstein, because
for all of these WE did nothing.
We can only be proud of the
good we did ourselves.
Just today
a young man, who means a lot to me, told
me, that I can be harsh and hurtful.
Always being good is for me as
difficult as it is for anyone else.
But I believe, that the atmosphere
in the BRD [West Germany] is defined
by our everyday actions, as
fathers, as mothers, as sons.
You can make paragraphs and write articles,
you can have the best Basic Laws.
What you need is the people,
who live for these democratic things.
What a maudlin. Is that
how he leads his agency?
No human creates democracy...
Don't worry about it, Karl. He's
the old guard, our dear father.
This is the task we all have to face.
We mustn't lose the courage...
Come, Karl.
Karl?
What are you doing?
Would you come downstairs right now?
He's a good informant and has
contacts in "Der Weg" in Argentina.
- Is he trustworthy?
- He was part of Hitler's enemy reconnaissance.
So one of Reinhard Gehlen's men? Is
he working for the BND nowadays?
Or maybe for the other side...
- For the Stasi? - It's a possibility.
But he's a good informant.
In my opinion he is most of
all one thing: corruptible.
If he works for the Stasi,
we'll go to prison.
And if he's a loyal BND man,
he'll maybe warn Eichmann.
But if we're lucky, he'll
find a second source.
Let's risk it.
Great performance, Dr Bauer.
- Your words moved me deeply.
Yes, yes, thanks.
Great, Dr Bauer, very great!
Good morning.
What an amazing performance.
- Enough of that. Thanks.
Is it your birthday? - No, they came from
Minister-President Zinn along with this telegram.
And there is your mail.
I will never appear on television
again, if that's the case.
Keep the flowers. I don't want them.
What do you want?
- I need information on a journalist,
who writes for "Der Weg" in Argentina.
His name is Klaus Eichmann and we're trying
to find out, if he's actually Adolf Eichmann.
Wouldn't you like to know?
It would be a coup for the
vengeful television attorney,
if he were to find our dear Uncle Eichmann.
Can you figure this out or not? - Of
course. It's just a question of the price.
- These are from the last days.
- Because of the television show.
Were these in today's post?
- Yes. - 9mm.
You're armed, right, Mr Bauer?
Yes, that's correct.
What calibre is your weapon?
9mm.
- As well. Interesting.
I would like to inspect your weapon. - Do you
believe he wrote those threatening letters himself?
I never said such a thing.
- Why do you want to see my weapon?
What exactly was your motive
in appearing on television?
Get out.
Out!
If you want us to investigate, you have
to cooperate. - Forget the whole thing!
Can I speak to you in private?
You misunderstood me
earlier, Attorney General.
I support you everywhere I can.
Aha.
I have a reliable source
who claims that the person you're
searching for resides in Kuwait.
This person being
Obersturmbannführer Adolf Eichmann.
He's hiding in Kuwait.
This is interesting.
We've actually been searching for
Adolf Eichmann for quite some time.
But you said several times to me,
that neither the BKA nor Interpol is
responsible for political criminals.
Right. Regrettably.
File an extradition request, then we can
cooperate with the local authorities.
Thank you, Mr Gebhardt. I
will set this in motion.
We have to defend our
country from its enemies.
Yes, that's certainly right.
What was that?
I need some fresh air.
I won't return, Ms Schütt.
What did Gebhardt say?
- It's over, Angermann.
Return to your daily business.
We have been exposed. - How?
Gebhardt told me, unprompted,
that Eichmann's in Kuwait.
He knows we're searching for him.
- Morlach! This is my fault.
No, we had to try.
But if Gebhardt knows,
Eichmann's long gone.
He's too dangerous for too many people.
Maybe it was naive to believe, we
could put him on trial in Frankfurt.
But that would have been
really something, Angermann.
Gebhardt!
He had the audacity to tell me, we have
to defend our country from its enemies.
The SS-Untersturmführer in
the security force! Me!
I fought for the SPD in the
streets of the Weimar Republic!
My father fought in World
War One for our Kaiser.
Tell me, Angermann. Am I
really an enemy of our state?
No, Fritz, you're not.
Goodbye, Karl.
- What will you do now?
Sleep. Sleep for a long time.
Knocking-off time!
Good evening. Thank you.
- Have a nice evening.
That isn't part of the deal.
I play the game the way I want to!
Incognito, incognito.
Come, play with me.
From today on we're
incognito, incognito.
No one will ever know ...
Whisky, please.
...what we are and what we were.
Come, let's bring it to the boil.
As long as we stay incognito.
Come in.
I just wanted to say hello.
Your singing was beautiful.
Hello, Mr Angermann. Come on in.
Do you remember me?
- But of course!
I just didn't think you would visit.
I've had a lot of work to do.
You look unhappy, Mr prosecutor.
A lost case.
Is there something I can
do to cheer you up?
You know the price?
But you, Mr prosecutor,
are like family to me.
For you it's free.
Don't, please...
What else would you want
here, late at night?
I don't know, I...
I... I have to leave, sadly.
You sang beautifully.
- Hello?
- I have news.
What were you thinking, calling
in the middle of the night?
That's not the way it works.
- Calm down, calm down!
Prosecutor, what is it?
I thought you wanted to make
your big catch. So, listen.
Klaus Eichmann isn't the man, you're searching
for. The last name is just a coincidence.
Drop the act. I know, that you betrayed us.
Me? When you haven't paid me yet?
Are you stupid?
Maybe you made twice the profit.
Have you heard the name
Willem Sassen before?
He's a Dutchman and was
an SS war correspondent.
Later on he became Perón's
press consultant.
Ever since the political circumstances in Argentina
became harsher, he's been in financial trouble.
Who isn't?
Sassen lives in Buenos Aires
and has done interviews
for years.
It seems dear Uncle Eichmann
wants to beautify his role in history.
So he agreed,
to Sassen writing his memoirs.
You mean these are Adolf Eichmann's
memoirs?- Yes, of course.
But this is just one out
of hundreds of bands.
He believes they'll become a big success.
And because he needs money, he wants
to sell the first parts immediately.
In any case this proves,
that Adolf Eichmann resides in Argentina.
Would it be correct to say, that you were
definitely involved in the decimation of the Jews?
Well, yes. Since it was me
who transported the Jews.
If it weren't for me, they wouldn't
have made their way to the executioner.
I'm like a commander, who attacked a
German city with his bomber squadron.
Was he convicted?
Why are we getting convicted?
I killed no one.
In the same way that the ground troops
loaded the bombs, we transported the Jews.
Besides Morlach, only the Minister-President
knows about our search for Eichmann.
Why would Gebhardt
suddenly start to talk about Eichmann?
I don't know.
You contacted Gebhardt yourself,
because of the death threats.
Maybe he said it on the spur of
the moment, pure coincidence.
Because he knows that we are
investigating it. - Maybe.
Dagoto or Klement?
Mossad will have had to check these names.
Yes, I wonder how Eichmann makes a living?
Does he have a job?
Maybe he works for this dubious company
in Argentina, like many Germans do?
CAPRI?
- Yes.
Or Mercedes.
Schneider. He works for
Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart.
SS-Schneider.
Angermann, I'll catch my death of cold.
Please turn on the ventilation.
Yes?
- Mr Schneider, you have a visitor.
I don't have any appointments. - A Dr Bauer, the
Attorney General for Hesse [a German state].
Please.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, Mr Schneider.
- Attorney General.
Please.
- Thank you.
How can I help you?
I investigated your job in the
strike force of the security force.
No calls please.
There is a way I can put
your case aside for a while.
And how?
You work for Human Resources here
at Daimler, is that correct?
Yes.
I would like to know if a
Mr Dagoto or a Mr Klement
works for Mercedes-Benz in Argentina.
And?
We have found our second source.
If Eichmann hasn't gone yet.
Come, play with me,
from today on we're incognito.
Incognito.
No one will ever know,
who we are and what we were.
Come, let's bring it to the boil.
As long as we stay incognito.
I'll gladly pay.
Really.
I don't expect any complacencies.
As you wish.
Good morning!
Hello, my angel. I'm sorry,
we worked through the night.
Thank you. They're pretty.
Karl...
We're having a baby.
Good day to you, Ms Schütt.
- Good morning, Doctor.
Please book a flight to Paris
for me for next weekend,
returning a week later.
- As you wish.
There is an urgent appointment request from
the head of the Central Office, Dr Schüle.
Is after your trip okay?
- Did Schüle say what it was about?
It's about an arrest warrant
for a Mr Eichmann, Adolf.
Reference number 6842.
Please ask Dr Schüle how
quickly he can get here.
Will do.
Thank you.
- Thanks.
Cigar?
- Yes, please.
So tell me.
Have you heard the name
Adolf Eichmann before?
Sure.
We are in charge of the investigation file.
I don't want to step on your
toes, but you have to act.
Tuviah Friedman,
a private investigator from Israel,
is breathing down my and the
whole central office's neck.
He is in contact with a Mr
Hermann from Argentina.
He said, he knows Eichmann
is there in hiding
and you know this and wouldn't do nothing.
Please tell Mr Tuviah Friedman,
that the Frankfurt prosecution
has completed its assignment dutifully.
And that a reliable source told us,
Eichmann resides in Kuwait
and not in Argentina.
But he shouldn't put any more effort
into this, you understand, Dr Schüle?
Because if Eichmann receives a warning whilst
he's in Kuwait, he'll probably disappear forever.
Please prepare a press
conference, Angermann.
When I return,
we'll announce, that we believe we've
tracked down Eichmann in Kuwait.
Dr Bauer, I...
Good luck.
What is it, Angermann?
I'm going to be a father.
Will you accompany me to the airport?
Gebhardt speaking.
- Yes, Kreidler.
The general is really
interested in Eichmann.
Today he met with Dr Schüle from the Central Office of
the Federal-State Administration of Justice Department.
Who then told me, they're
searching for Eichmann in Kuwait.
Yes. Several of our fellow
countrymen live in Kuwait.
At this moment, the general
is travelling to Paris.
Maybe our colleagues in the BND
could keep an eye on Mr Bauer,
with these ongoing death
threats from the last time.
Yes, that sounds like a good idea.
I'll see to it. Thanks.
- I can't be a good father.
- Why do you think that?
Mr Mahler and I have known
each other for a long time.
We have skeletons in the cupboard.
You can safely say anything here.
There are these rumours about you,
that not only did the Gestapo pursue you
as a socialist with Jewish heritage
but that you also had problems
with the Danish vice squad.
Yes. There were incidents.
I've had a feeling for quite some time
now, that we have similar interests.
I met someone.
An "easy girl".
- How often have you been together?
Once.
What am I supposed to tell you, Karl?
You know you've committed
a criminal offence.
The first time as a punter,
you can get away with it,
if you claim that you didn't know
that the lady wasn't a lady.
But not the second time.
My wife Anna Marie and I have been
living separately for many years,
she's in Copenhagen, I'm here.
I think it's one of the
happiest marriages there is.
If your wife is a good companion, you
don't have to be afraid of children.
You'll be a fantastic father.
I am so grateful for your candour.
Only... the price we have
to pay is very high.
You mustn't see that young man
ever again, you know that.
Right?
- Yes.
You're in transit? This way.
You're in transit, Monsieur?
- Yes. - This way.
Yes? - The general is
travelling onward, to Israel.
Well, where Jews just like to go.
Maybe he will contact Mossad.
That would be considered treason.
Exactly.
Dr Bauer.
Chaim Cohn. Call me Herman.
- Good afternoon.
Please.
It's nice to finally meet you in person.
You know Isser Harel already. This is Zvi
Aharoni, he was born in Germany too.
I'm from the other Frankfurt.
- Ah.
You know, I studied in
Frankfurt on the Main.
I'll have to visit you some time. Sit down.
Do you want something to drink?
- No, I want to cut to the chase.
I managed to find a second,
independent source,
confirming that Ricardo
Klement is Eichmann's alias.
You said that on the telephone already.
We have to check your source.
We've lost months and now you
want to check the source?
Eichmann could change his name and move.
How much more time has to pass?
Every second-class
policeman could catch him!
Dr Bauer, we understand you're agitated.
Zvi is a very capable officer.
He'll lead the new investigation.
When we can trust the second
source, I'll lead an operation.
Who is the second source, Dr Bauer?
I've already put the first source in danger
and Isser left his work
to the Hermann family.
My second source will stay secret.
My word has to suffice.
Ricardo Klement is Adolf Eichmann.
If you don't act now,
I'll turn to the German authorities.
If they wanted to help,
you wouldn't be here.
Do you think so?
We will endeavour.
Thank you.
One more thing.
When you have Eichmann, I'll put in a
request for his extradition to Israel.
He's not to be condemned here, as if
he'd murdered 6 million Jews on his own.
He has to go on trial in Frankfurt.
The Germans have to face their past.
I will support your request, Dr Bauer.
Wonderful, thank you very much.
Shalom.
Good luck to you.
- I'll do my best.
When I return to Frankfurt,
I'll tell the press,
that I suspect Eichmann's in Kuwait.
Good.
I called for this press conference,
because we've learnt from the
Federal Criminal Police Office,
that SS-Obersturmbannführer Adolf Eichmann,
responsible for the deportation of the Jews,
is hiding in Kuwait.
A request for extradition
has been submitted.
One moment, not everyone at once.
Next stop: Carretera San Fernando.
Hold up, Señor.
The German nation feels deep satisfaction,
that through atonement for
the victims of Nazism,
Israel's construction process
has been furthered...
The Germany of today isn't the
Germany of yesterday anymore.
I wish only the best for the chancellor,
in his task, of leading Germany into
democracy and international cooperation.
Yes?
- We've got him.
Thanks.
Special edition! Special edition!
Adolf Eichmann snatched in Argentina!
Special edition! Special edition!
Adolf Eichmann snatched in Argentina!
Dr Bauer!
Another one please.
We've done it, Karl!
- I can't believe it!
You can tell me everything somewhere quiet.
- But I don't know any more than you!
Cheers, Karl!
- Cheers!
There we were, all standing up to the morning
applause in front of the dreaded camp commander,
and he shouts: "Schumacher! Why are
you in the concentration camp?"
Schumacher said:
"Because I'm part of the defeated party."
He was really tough.
Kurt Schumacher was in the
concentration camp for twelve years.
But I...
I totally capitulated... to the Nazis
in an open Letter, they
printed it in the newspaper:
"The socialist Bauer totally capitulated".
And I got out.
I've never forgiven myself.
But Schumacher didn't capitulate.
You never must bow to tyranny, Karl.
Never.
I have to leave, I can't drink
like I used to in the old days.
I am a man,
with everything
that makes a man.
And if you laugh about me,
I'm just
a sweet little caprice of nature.
I am a man, feel free to look at me,
because I don't care,
for this little caprice of nature
leaves a big trace with me.
The song is very unmindful.
Aren't you afraid?
You remember Johann Krauss,
5-Deutschmark-Johann? - Yes, why?
He's the love of my life.
One moment!
You promised me, Johann
would get out earlier.
I'm sorry.
- Don't get up, prosecutor.
Well, well, the love is our
bane, isn't that right?
This one is also very pretty.
Yes, hm, hm...
This hasn't cost you your job or family.
I can keep a lot to myself. Incognito...
What do you want?
- Is Bauer behind the Eichmann abduction?
I don't know, what you're talking about.
Fine. Keep the copies. Maybe your
wife wants to see them, before...
No, no, wait!
I will give you a week.
You have to accuse Bauer of treason for
his work with a foreign secret service
or you'll go to prison.
- Have you heard about the Eichmann abduction?
- If only we could've done that!
Yes. That would've been
a great accomplishment.
Come in.
You wanted to talk to me?
- Yes, come in.
Is everything alright?
I haven't seen you all week.
I had private obligations.
- Aha.
Accompany me to the Minister-President.
Zinn negotiated Eichmann's extradition
with the Federal Government.
Fritz.
Where did Rosa Luxemburg remain?
- You really notice everything.
This is prosecutor Angermann.
Pleased to meet you.
- Minister-President.
After you.
- Thanks.
I have to congratulate you, Fritz.
You too, Mr Angermann.
The other prosecutors must be impressed.
- Yes, they are, with Mossad.
And that's the way it'll stay.
Of course, I understand.
May I offer you something to drink? That's
cause for a celebration. - No, thank you.
What's the government's decision?
Please.
Sadly, the Federal Government won't
file a request for extradition.
Eichmann will be put on trial in Israel.
- Excuse me.
The Israelis promised me. Chaim Cohn
supports the request for extradition.
Cohn is just a jurist, Fritz.
There is more at stake here.
- Exactly.
Don't you know, why Ben-Gurion
and Adenauer met in New York?
Because Israel wants to buy German weapons.
Germany will only deliver weapons, if
Eichmann is put on trial in Jerusalem.
They are mighty nervous in
Bonn, especially Mr Globke.
No one wants a government
crisis, besides the Soviets.
That's why the USA will do anything
to protect the Adenauer government.
And the Israelis need German weapons.
Here...
The decline of the Ministry of Justice.
I told you so, Georg.
If I don't get Eichmann, I won't
have any more strength to continue.
But you hunted Eichmann down.
That's a success.
No! It's Israel's success.
It would've been mine, if Eichmann
were to list all the Nazis,
who lead this republic as war profiteers
today, in front of a German court.
There will be other chances.
But not for me anymore.
Where do you want to go, Dr Bauer?
Dr Bauer?
What will you do now, Fritz?
What will you do?
I think, I'll resign from my office.
You mustn't do that. You mustn't do that.
Vogler and Kügler are onto something.
Have you heard about the
"Breslau Documents"?
They're reports from the
Auschwitz camp commander Höß.
He lists the SS men and their victims.
Actual actions, confirmed by the
camp commander, you understand?
We could put Auschwitz on trial. A
cross-section of the whole camp.
But...
But I don't believe in it anymore.
They always find a way to stop us.
Please stop. Stop!
Are you getting off here?
- Yes, I have to.
I have to get off now.
Don't give up, Fritz. Please.
Karl!
Come with me.
Come in.
- Chief prosecutor Kreidler.
- He can enter.
Dr Bauer, you wanted to speak to me?
- Yes.
Will you take on the
Angermann case yourself?
Sure.
It has to be that way.
A prosecutor with such irregular
behaviour has to be dealt with cleanly.
Is that a problem for you?
I thought you were close?
You should acknowledge,
that he himself reported his
sexual offence with this boy.
Yes, sure.
He is your favourite in
your young guard, right?
Are you prejudiced in this matter?
No, Kreidler. Do your job.
Yes.
But be sure to know:
I'll do mine.
As long as I live,
nobody will stop me from
doing that ever again.
