How are you?
Emile. Nice day for your wedding.
- Yes, is my suit ready?
- Certainly.
- I want to pay you today, Maurice.
- No hurry.
No no no. You're just getting started,
and business is bad.
- Look at these.
- All sold?
One is yours.
And the rest...
are for the Vicomte de Barres.
Vicomte de Barres?
The best dressed man in France?
I'm making all his clothes now,
and he'll make my reputation.
He owes me 40,000 francs.
- That's what I call success.
- Yes.
- That's fine. 2,000 francs, right?
- Right.
Oh, it's the across Paris run.
- Monsieur Vicomte.
- Maurice...
- Monsieur Vicomte was in the race?
- No, just temporarily.
Maurice, have you
some of my clothes ready?
Are fifteen suits enough?
Well lock the door and
give me a suit quickly.
- He may come along any minute.
- Who?
The girl's husband.
He came home unexpectedly.
What girl?
Well, she is...
Well, I don't remember.
The husband started running after me,
and I ran, and I found myself in the race.
I presume Monsieur Vicomte
has no more need of this.
No. No, no, I got it off a fruit stand.
Emile, Emile...
would you mind giving the room
to Monsieur Vicomte, please?
Yes, yes, with pleasure.
Thank you, thank you, Maurice.
Thank you.
Go right in there.
Monsieur Vicomte, about the bill...
About the bill, Monsieur Vicomte...
The pants are a very good fit, Maurice.
Thank you.
Monsieur Vicomte, about the bill.
Tonight, Maurice, I'll go down
to my family Chateau
and get my uncle the Duke to
hand over my next allowance.
Oh, thank you, Monsieur Vicomte.
What about my friend,
the shirt-maker, who's making
the new shirts for you?
- Get his bill too.
- Thank you.
And what about my friends,
the hatter and the boot-maker?
I'll pay them all at once.
A clean sweep, Maurice.
Thank you, Monsieur Vicomte.
Very nice, very nice.
And now, Maurice...
And now, Maurice, eh...
Do you suppose you can let
me have a little something?
Money?
Yes, yes...
You see I'm running around
without my wallet.
How much could you spare?
A thousand francs?
Oh, no no, that's too much.
I should say 500...
- Oh, Monsieur Vicomte, take the thousand.
- No no no...
But Monsieur Vicomte, you're
going to need it.
Well I'll tell you. You let me have the
2,000 and we'll say no more about it.
Tomorrow, Maurice, I'll be here
with bags of gold for you.
- Bags of gold.
- A thousand thanks, Monsieur Vicomte.
Maurice, it's beautiful.
Just think, with a little cloth
you make a work of art.
Art for your sweetheart.
It's like poetry in a book...
Ah, how beautiful I look.
[...] united with a thread.
- The romance of the scissors...
- So Claire and I can wed.

Princess? Jeanette?.
Count, I'm going to bed.
- I've just come up to join you.
- Join me?
Join you in a
little chat before dinner.
Not tonight.
I've had another fainting
spell and my uncle, the Duke,
thought bed was
the best place for me.
I always think that do you
wonderful well.
- Count, why the ladder?
- Oh, it's more romantic.
Careful.
Oh, I've brought along my flute,
hoping to entertain.
No, count. Not tonight.
Oh, before I go.
Remember what I said to you
down by the horse trough?
- Quite well.
- Oh, What was it?
I simply wish to see if it
made any impression.
You said "I love you".
Made no impression whatever.
There's probably no use of repeating
the sentiment at this time.
None at all.
Oh, Princess...
I trust you don't find
my wooing too ardent.
I was just admiring your
restraint, good night, Count.
On with the dreams, Princess.
I'll never be able to use it again.
Oh, Count, did you break your leg?
No, I fell flat on my flute.
- Yes, no league, no.
- But not too long.
Oh, may it help our niece
grow strong.
Plants from the woods
and birds from the dales
are certain cures for
fainting spells.
Please heaven, we no start in vain.
May morning bring her health again.
Oh, ¿what?
My dear Duke, you can get rid
of me for 20 thousand francs.
My dear Countess, I...
Oh, Uncle, don't be so pompous.
I'm only asking for some of the
money you're holding in trust for me.
If I gave you any,
you'll go straight back to Paris.
You're staying here, Valentine.
What you need is more of
the simple life, young woman.
- Oh, uncle...
- I say...
come in.
- The new footmen, your grace.
- Oh.
- Uncle...
- No.
Can't we ever get a footman
under forty in this place?
Valentine.
About the schedule for the guests
for tomorrow, your grace...
Tomorrow?
Bridge, at three...
And dinner, at eight.
And after dinner, bridge.
- Rather an amusing day, Flammand?
- Quite exciting, your grace.
And what are the
guests doing now, Flammand?
Playing bridge, your grace.
You wait. I'm going
right back to Paris.
A man?
Oh no, just cousin Gilbert.
What are you doing?
Trying to get up enough
energy to go to bed.
What are you
doing in this dull hole?
Oh, I'm just passing through.
I got a taxi waiting
to take me back to Paris.
Take me with you.
That's not a bad idea.
It may save for haven't to see uncle.
How much money can you loan me?
I'm over my allowance and uncle
won't let me have any money.
Oh, you don't know how to
handle the old sky-hawk.
I'll tell him I need the money for charity.
To provide good homes
for bad stenographers.
- Flammand...
- Aha.
Send that taxi away.
No, no uncle, now look,
I've got to go back to Paris.
You can't. You're
staying here permanently.
And if I hear any more about your debts,
any more bills, I'll cut
you off without a soudle.
Now, you understand?
You imp... imp...
- Now, what's the word?
- Impecunious.
- No, no, no.
- Impudent?
- No, no.
- No, no.
- Impostor.
- No.
- Impertinent.
- Ah, that's it.
- You impertinent jack... jack...
- Jackal?
- Well I'm sorry.
- Jackass?
No, no.
I wish you go to bed.
Jackanapes.
You impertinent, jackanape,
liar, cheat.
Liar.
Cheat.
- - You'll be insulting me in a minute.
- Nitwit.
Numbskull. Nincompoop.
Lord, grant her rest be sweet and deep.
And knights go riding through her sleep.
Her own Prince Charming, young and bold.
Who came to Princesses of old.
- Never to us...
- Never to us...
Never to us.
Stir slowly...
Slowly, and may it
heal her howling.
- I want the money for my shirts.
- And my shoes. And my hats.
You introduced him to us.
You said his trade
will bring other business.
It will.
We must be careful not to insult
the Vicomte de Barres.
He comes from the old nobility,
- quick to take offense.
- And slow to pay.
- Maurice Courtelain?
- Yes.
I understand you made a lot of clothes
for the Vicomte de Barres...
Ah, you see, you see Monsieur, that I
made a lot of clothes for the Vicomte.
If Monsieur will take a chair...
I'll show him samples.
- Monsieur is a friend of the Vicomte?
- Not at all.
You know who I am?
Oh... now I understand.
Oh, Monsieur, monsieur, why
don't you try to forgive and forget?
This is Paris, city of romance, love.
Please, forgive the Vicomte
and forgive also your wife.
I have no wife.
What is all this?
You are not the man who
chased the Vicomte in his BVDs?
Certainly not.
I am the credit manager of the
Association of Retail Merchants.
I came here to tell you,
that not a tailor in Paris
will make that fellow a suit
without full payment in advance.
You... you... you mean...
I mean...
the Vicomte de Barres
never pays.
The Vicomte, never pays...
- My shirts.
- My hats.
- My boots.
- My suits...
Gentlemen...
you have my profound sympathy.
The old nobility, eh?
Do you know what I'd like to do?
I'd like to have a crowd march down
there and attack that chateau.
- Wait. That's an idea...
- You think we could?
Just like in the old days?
What about the police?
I don't mean attack it in a crowd.
Let me attack it, alone.
I'll be a one-man French Revolution.
Let me have all the
goods the Vicomte ordered.
I'll deliver them to the chateau.
And I'll make him pay.
Maurice. I just heard you were
going. Let me husband drive you.
He had to go to the
art shop of his employer,
and he'd love to drop you.
Pierre, tell Maurice
you'd love to drop him.
I'd love to drop you.
Get in.
Oh, that's fine. Over here.
Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, just like a millionaire.
A millionaire.
Oh no, look at that.
I'm not going to drink that.

Oh. My ankle.
I think is better that you
put your arms around me.
Would you think I put my arms
around people I don't know?
My name is Maurice.
Oh, that's nothing.
- Is this ankle?
- No, it's quite unnecessary.

No no no.

No, I said, do you live down here?

Yes. Let me sing for you.
You are insane.
But you sang for me.
I didn't even know you existed.

Good old Pierre.
We can go on if I ever fix this car.
Princess. Help. Help.
Help. Help.

She's fainted again.
You know, I had an elder brother
who used to faint quite often.
- He was a nip-omaniac.
- A what?
A nip-omaniac.
He used to go
around pinching things.
Oh, I had a friend like that.
He used to pinch
business girls in elevators.
They had to send
him to a cooler climate...
- No... I knew a girl...
- This is no time for reminiscences.
Get a couple of footmen
to carry her upstairs.
But you gave the
servants the afternoon off.
Our footmen are playing football
against the Old Soldiers Home.
Well, you two carry her upstairs.
Someone fetch a doctor.
You carry her, I'll get the doctor.
Valentine, can you go for a doctor?
Certainly, bring him right in.
No, no, it's for Jeanette.
She's fainted again.
Princess,
permit me to introduce
doctor Armand de Pertignac.
- Your Highness...
- Doctor.
And now my dear,
remove your dress.
- My what?
- Your dress.
There's no occasion for distress.
- Is that necessary?
- Very. Yes.
As long as professional ethics apply,
I'll see you with only a doctor's eye.
The doctor's eye is satisfied.
Now I'll hear your heart.
Don't sigh.
Very good. Nothing wrong here.
Now I'll take your pulse, my dear.
Perfectly regular, right on the tick.
Madam, oh Madam, you cannot be sick.
Then why do I lie awake in bed?
And why does blood rush to my head?
- At night?
- Quite right, at night.
And why does music make me sad?
And why do love
songs drive me mad?
- At night?
- Quite right, at night.
- And frequently I faint.

I suppose we better call it off.
No, no; Go right ahead.
Oh, then Jeanette is
not in any danger?
Well, nothing immediate.
But...
The Princess...
ought to be married.
- Married?
- Married?
To a man of her own age.
Ah, but the only two
eligible men in France,
the only two of rank
equal to Her Highness are
not exactly of my niece's age.
- How old are they?
- One is 85...
and the other will be 12
on his next birthday.
- Well, this is a problem.
- What do you recommend?
Exercise...
exercise...
and exercise.
Exercise...
- This gives me new hope.
- Eh?
About my chances of marrying Jeanette.
I'll ask her to consider
me as a prescription.
My dear Count de Savignac,
the only obstacle lies in the
delicate matter of rank.
Jeanette demands a prince at least.
And you are not a prince.
Well I would've been if our family hadn't
been badly gypped during the crusades.
Anyway, your grace mustn't forget
the tenth Count de Sauvignac.
What about him?
- Marie Antoinette?
- Positively.
- Now may I ask Jeanette?
- Yes, but not this afternoon.
Quite right. Of course, that's me,
you know, always impetuous.
Monsieur...
Mademoiselle..
I'm looking for the Vicomte de Barres.
I didn't know he was expecting a friend.
- Are you alone?
- Alone?
- I mean in life. You're not married?
- Ah, no.
I'll be right down.
Monsieur...
Who made that for you?
McClintock and Armstrong, Monsieur...
Of London.
Might I recommend them
for your own service?
Oh no, thank you. I'm looking
for the Vicomte des Barres.
- Possibly in the drawing room, Monsieur.
- Thanks.
- Mesdames...
- Monsieur...
- His smile is so disarming.
- So grand.
- So gay.
- So charming.
Mesdames...
We bore you with our sewing?
- Sewing?
- Quite so.
Oh no. A needle is magnetic.
- How true.
- And how poetic.
- Mesdames...
- Monsieur...
Oh no, no. Never use silk on armor.
Flannel is the thing.
Oh, are you interested in armor?
Any kind of wearing apparel.
- Is this your only job?
- Oh no, I putter around.
Tell me, where can
I find the Vicomte de Barres?
Oh, he's somewhere about.
I hate him.
Imagine...
he would like to tear down
this beautiful chateau.
No, it would be better
to tear down the Vicomte.
You're a man after my own heart.
- You have a soul.
- Someone looking for me?
- Ah, Monsieur Vicomte.
- Maurice...
I came down about those...
My, my, how well you're looking.
You, you've met my uncle?
- Uncle?
- The, the, the Duke.
Oh yes, we had a little chat.
He's the first of your friends
who I haven't wanted to
hit with a battle axe.
- OH...
- He recommended flannel.
Flannel? Would you
pardon us a moment, uncle?
Maurice, may I have a word with you?
Maurice, did you tell
uncle about those bills?
But I didn't get a chance.
And I didn't know he was your uncle.
Now, Vicomte, I brought all your
clothes and I want the money.
See, it's 63,000 francs.
And I'm here also on behalf
of my fellow creditors.
Put yourself in their place.
I'd like to. It isn't anyone who
can be a creditor nowadays.
Now, Maurice, I'm going
to be frank with you.
Right now I can't pay you.
Ah, then I'll have to see the Duke.
He'll throw you out,
he hates tradesmen.
He'll throw me out too,
so what's the use?
I won't leave the chateau
without my money.
Oh why do you say that.
Well, I...
I've got it..
Then stay here
I'll have the money in
a few days, I'll borrow it.
No no no, this is no place for me.
- A tailor in a chateau.
- Well why not?
- No no, I'm going to see the Duke.
- Oh, Maurice, please...
Oh...
Oh. The charming young man.
I'm trying to persuade him to stay.
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- Oh there you are.
Yes.
And you been trying to
persuade him to stay...
- No we really are...
- Oh, you're staying. Jeanette.
Countess Emilia...
let me present...
Gilbert, present your friend.
Yes yes, of course.
This is my good friend...
Mauri... Eh, Baron Courtelain.
Yes, I've met the Baron.
We're trying to persuade him to stay.
- - Are we?
- The Baron must've changed.
He used to make very sudden decisions.
I'll stay.

I'm giving it up in your interest.

Concerns the Baron.

No, but I'm not as familiar as I might

Mind you, I still have 36 more volumes
to look through before I'm sure.
Yes, but this fellow is
a friend of Gilbert's.
Gilbert I need only
remind you is none too choosy.
Well, you go right ahead, my boy.
Oh, well, Maurice. You look great.
Is that my new riding habit?
No no, not until you
paid for it, Monsieur Vicomte.
I've been up since
daybreak altering it to fit me.
Oh, I see...
Have you picked out
something good to ride on?
- The best I could get.
- Is it the big gray one?
No, small, orange, with black stripes.
Orange with black...
What is it, a zebra?
No. A bicycle.
You can't use a bicycle in a hunt.
You got to ride a horse.
No, but I've never been
on a horse in my life.
Well Baron...
I want to lend you a horse
worthy of your line.
- Thunderbolt.
- Thunderbolt?
- He's fast, but furious.
- Say, you better, I...
I think I'd better not.
You see, the harder the
horse, the harder I get.
- I might hurt Thunderbolt.
- Oh, he can take it.
Oh Baron. I took the liberty of
choosing a horse for you.
Oh, that's so kind of you.
I won't need your Thunderbolt.
What's my horse's name?
- Solitude.
- Oh, Solitude.
- Well. Good hunting.
- Well, I'm set.
Solitude sounds just my type.
You know why they
call him Solitude?
Why?
Because he always come home alone.
Solitude for Baron Courtelain.
What's the point in giving
the Baron a horse like that?
I want to test the Baron.
I can think of several better
ways to do that, let me try.
Don't bother, tell me, you ever
think of anything but men, dear?
- Oh, yes.
- Like what?
- Schoolboys.
- Ohh.
I know that's Solitude.
No, that's only Thunderbolt.
There's Solitude.
Oh, Gilbert. He's not going to...
Oh Gilbert, don't let him.
Oh, Gilbert.
Stand back. Stand back.
What is this?
This? This is oats, madame.
Very wild.
And this is the stag.
Very tired.
And where's Solitude?
We agreed to separate.
- He went home. Alone.
- And what are your plans?
Oh, very simple, madame. After
supper, the stag will go right to bed.
He's had a hard day.
And the hunt just stops, I suppose.
A very happy ending, madame.
- Which we both approve.
- I do not approve.
No, no. I mean the
stag and myself.
No true nobleman would mock
the tradition of the hunt like this.
There are things too fine,
too sacred, to be made ridiculous.
Oh, your Highness is losing your temper.
I'm not losing my temper.
You let that stag go.
No.
He'd be caught and killed.
You wouldn't want that,
madame, look...
Look at those eyes.
You are not a gentleman.
You need some lessons.
And you, your Highness,
are not a woman.
You need some lessons too.
You know too much about
hunting, etiquette, tradition...
You know nothing about style...
charm...
love.
Your riding habit...
Look, you riding habit, it's not
graceful, it's not in the mode.
And your hair...
It's too prim, madame.
It's to severe.
Please let me be judge that...
But your riding habit...
It's discouraging.
- What are you doing now?
- I'm thinking...
I'm thinking about you
without these clothes.
Open your eyes, at once.
Oh no, pardon, madame.
I mean, with different clothes.
- Smart clothes.
- Here they are...
- The clothes?
- The hunt.
What's the meaning of this?
- The stag, the stag, he's asleep.
- What?
Shh. We must go back, he's very tired.
Go back, go back.
Quickly and quietly.
Go back. Quickly and quietly.
On tiptoe.
On tiptoe.
Oh, madame.
Good hunting?
No luck.
The Baron and the deer made friends
and called the whole thing off.
Well I've had good hunting.
There's no such title
as Baron de Courtelain.
What?
Gilbert, did you hear that?
I've even been through the
better class illegitimates.
- And still no Courtelain?
- Not a Courtelain.
Now Gilbert...
who the deuce is your friend?
Well, uncle, I don't think
I'd better tell you.
- It wouldn't be safe.
- Wouldn't be safe?
You see, I owe Maurice something...
You owe him something?
Uncle, you shouldn't keep
repeating everything I say.
- You live the life of an echo.
- Will you kindly come to the point.
Uncle...
we live in an age of toppling thrones...
of uneasy crowns,
of persecuted royalty compelled at
times to travel under
strange names.
Right?
Are you trying to hint
that your friend is...
royalty?
Well, I...
He has the Hapsburg lip.
And the name...
Baron Courtelain is...
A mere nom de pullman.
Well, we're all here except the Baron.
Good, then we're all here.
Count, could you do
something to entertain?
No, I'm helpless since my accident.
- Accident?
- I fell flat on my flute.
Ah, Emperor.
Have you seen Valentine, uncle?
Why no, she's not here either.
The Baron and Valentine
are both missing.
You know uncle, it's dangerous to
invite guests with a girl like that around.
- Somebody will sue us.
- Ah, there you are.
The Baron will be down in a moment.
He had to send to Paris for his
costume, It was late getting here.
- I've been watching him put it on.
- You've been what?
It's all right, uncle, she
has the room next to Maurice.
And she's bored holes
in the connecting door.
Valentine?
Are you aware that...?
Are you...
Are you... Now...
Are you aware that that door
come down to us
through generations?
So have my instincts.
Hey, she had you there, unc.
Will you stop blowing
that infernal bladder?
Thank you, madame.
- Oh, how original.
- Thank you, madame.
- Oh, how intriguing.
- Thank you, madame.
How common.
Do you find my costume
out of place, madame?
Decidedly.
Maybe you're right.
An Apache among all these nobility.
And yet I understand an
Apache wanting to come.
- Where there is beauty and light.
- Yes,
But people should be on guard against him.
You don't like the Apache, eh?
I dislike his attitude toward women.
Oh madame, you do not
understand the Apache.
He's not always such a bad fellow.
I'd like to tell you
what he really feels.
- I'd love to know.
- And I... am not interested.
Are they always so brutal with girls?
- Haven't they any weak moments?
- How do they live?
I'll tell you the story of one
who I have known.

I brought you over
here because I want you.
Oh, Countess.
I want you to keep as far
away from me as possible.
Countess, I'll try.
Pardon me, Countess,
something I must do.
Some place I must go.
Princess.
Princess...
open your eyes, Princess.
Open your eyes.
No.
Don’t open your eyes.
Sleep.
So I can tell you how beautiful you are.
How beautiful...
And how I love you.
And how I love you.
How dare you.
Wait...
- Why did you do that?
- Because I love you.
You...
you kissed me, Princess.
Why?
Because...
I love you, Maurice.
You...
you love me?
Yes.
I thought against it,
I was afraid.
Oh, my darling...
how foolish I was.
- Perhaps you were wise.
- Why?
Fear is a warning, Princess.
I don't understand you, Maurice.
Let me dream this dream a little longer.
When I wake...
I'll go away.
Go away?
- Don't you want me, Maurice?
- I want you, my Princess.
But...
I have wanted the moon too.
Look, my hands are empty.
Your arms need ever be
empty of me, Maurice.
We have found each other in darkness.
Like ships
that come into harbor
together, at night.
When morning comes...
one's there...
one sails away.
We'll sail together...
or stay together.
I love you, my beautiful Princess.
I love you.
This, I can tell you,
this is mine.
- Jeanette...
- Maurice...
You don't know who I am.
You're you...
and I love you.
But... if I...
If I were not...
what you think I am.
- If I...
- Whoever you are...
Whatever you are...
Wherever you are...
I love you.
Jeanette, you know what I think?
I think I'm mad.
And that you are mad.
And that the whole world is mad.
But I'm luckiest man of all.
And the happiest.
Listen, my beautiful Princess.
I love you. I love you.
And whatever comes tomorrow...
Love me tonight.
Love me tonight.
"Whoever you are...
whatever you are..."
"Wherever you are...
I love you".
"Oh, my Princess..."
"You don't know who I am.
I am... I am a tailor."
"A tailor? A tailor.
Isn't it romantic."
"Oh, I love you."

Let me see.
There...
There, it's superb.
Come in.
- You sent for me, Princess?
- Yes.
Yes?
Yes...
I'd like your advice on
my new riding habit.
- Beautiful.
- Do you really think so?
Perfect.
How about the length?
Divine...
Here, look at it more closely.
The closer I get,
the more perfect.
Monsieur has taste.
- How about the color?
- Lucky color.
- Anything wrong?
- Oh, certainly.
The color rides up.
- Oh no, that won't do at all.
- You think so, Monsieur?
Oh yes, madame, yes.
And look, it's too
tight here, madame.
It's too tight across the chest.
And the lapels, the lapels,
they're too stiff.
No, no, really.
The whole thing lacks
smartness, youth, grace.
- No, no, no...
- Oh, Maurice...
Your Highness, I have
never been so insulted.
With your permission, I'm going.
Madame Pituar, madame Pituar...
Maurice, what am I going to do now?
Don't worry, Jeanette.
We'll fix it.
How?
We'll fix it.
No, no...
That's not possible...
We'll make you a riding habit...
that will tame Solitude.
But how?
The important thing...
is not to hurry.
What's the matter?
- I have never been so insulted in my life.
- Who insulted you?
- What?
- Madame Pituar has been insulted.
- At her age? Remarkable.
- Madame Pituar has been insulted.
Some men have no taste.
- Madame Pituar has been insulted.
- The old girl must have something.
Shh. Let us look into this.
- A scandal.
- An outrage.
- I'll shoot this.
- Oh, let me die.
No, let me explain.
I was only fixing the
Princess's riding habit.
- What?
- Uncle, uncle, that's the truth.
- Preposterous.
- I give you my word of honor.
I tell why the Baron often gives
people advice about their clothes.
Be quiet.
What you say is insulting.
- I'll run him through for this.
- You've already shot him.
Silence.
- Silence.
- Silence.
I'll prove I'm telling the truth.
Give me two hours and I'll
remodel this riding habit.
What?
Alright.
I'll convict you by
your own falsehood.
- I'll give you two hours, sir.
- Yeah, he'll do it.
- I'll bet he can't do it.
- I'll bet you 10,000 francs he can.
- I'll bet you 50,000 he's a liar.
- Your done.
Your grace, time flies.
Quite right. Leave them alone, everybody.
- I'll give you two hours, sir.
- 50,000 francs, now, eh?
- Maurice, what will you do now?
- You'll see. Two hours to go.
Wait a minute...
now...
and this...
Now I start.
Five.
Twelve.
Twenty two.
Twenty eight.
Excuse me...
How do you like it?
Oh, it's perfect.
Of course, if I had more time...
Too perfect.
Tell me, How were you able
to make this habit in 2 hours?
How were you able to make it at all?
Because...
Because I am a tailor...
- What?
- A tailor.
Oh Maurice, you're joking.
No.
I'm not a baron...
I am a tailor.
Does that make so much difference?
A tailor...
Last night...
you said to me...
Whoever you are...
Whatever you are...
Wherever you are, I love you.
Remember?
Jeanette, what happened?
Why, Baron, what happened?
I just told her I'm not a baron.
I'm a tailor.
- A tailor?
- Yes, a tailor.
Help. Help.
Help. Help. Help.
The Baron. He's not a baron.
He's a tailor.
What?
- The Baron,
- he's not a baron.
He's a tailor.
What do you know about this?
Well I, I.
- You see, I owed him some bills.
- Bills?
I'll deal with you later.
But first I'll get Flammand to give
this tradesman his money and kick him out.
A cane.

Stop the train. I'm going with you.
Oh no, Your Highness forgets I'm a tailor.
I love you. I can't live without you.
I love you, but you couldn't
be a tailor's wife.
I could and I will.
Stop the train.
No, I love you too much. You

- Stop the train.
- What happened?
I love him.
- That's not a railroad problem.

No. No.

Come, darling, come...
Once upon a time there was a
Princess and a Prince Charming...
- Who was not a prince.
- But who was charming.
And they lived happily ever after...
