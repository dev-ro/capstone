Stories heal.
Stories hurt.
If we repeat them
often enough,
they become real.
They make us who we are.
They have such power.
This I learned
on the very last autumn
of our childhood.
Now it's time
to dig yourselves
out of your graves,
Mill Valley.
It's Halloween.
But be careful,
'cause when the sun goes down,
it's The Season of the Witch.
♪ When I look out my window
♪ Many sights to see
I did it.
I'm going to 'Nam. Yeah.
Those commies
are gonna pay.
Let's go scare
some kiddies tonight, guys.

different people to be

Going out
with your friends tonight?
I'd rather just stay in.
...and stand ready tonight
to defend an honored cause.

Stella, pick up.
Stella...
I don't want to go
trick-or-treating.
Stella. Stella,
this isn't about candy.
It's about payback.
Get all the eggs
and TP you can
and meet us at 7:00.
Stella, please.
This could be
our last Halloween together.
If you think
you have it hard,
I have to fish a turd
out of the toilet.
You are
disgusting, Chuck.
Hey!
You know
where you're going, kid?
Following the harvest.
Tonight only.
Mom. It's fine.
No, it's not.
Still a little loose
in the crotch.
One more.
Take that!
Bullseye.
You got to pick up
every stitch...
Let's go, girls.
Hey, gimme.
Eat shit, Harold.
Tommy, slow down.
Must be the season

What the hell
are you doing?
A little privacy, please!
Ugh.
I said Spider-Man.
Not a spider...
man.
Be happy
the Lord provided.
Mom, okay, jeez.
Mom, can I please breathe?
Be nice.
Okay! Can you please
stop hugging me like that?
Aren't you a little old to
be trick-or-treating? Hmm?
Aren't you too ugly
to go on a date?
You little turd.
Auggie's here, gotta run.
I don't wanna hear it.
Thought you were
gonna be Spider-Man.
Yeah, well,
get used to it, okay.
I got the goods,
so let's banana split.
Stop staring at my sister,
you perv.

Hey, can you not?
I mean,
these antennae aren't even realistic.
And, if anything,
a spider man
should have eight arms,
not four.
Okay. At least
I'm not a clown.
For the last time,
I'm a Pierrot.
It's a 17th-century character
from la commedia dell'arte.
Psst. Clown.
Do you even know
what's in those?
It's the same toxic chemicals that's
giving our troops Hodgkin's lymphoma
and curdling the breast milk
of the South Vietnamese.
- Mmm.
- And you ate them all.
Mmm.
Is that why
they taste so good?
Out of the way, clown.
Nerd!
Move!
- He's not gonna show.
- What? No, he'll show.
Okay, Milner does it
every year
and this year
will be his last.
Where are you, Tommy?
I heard
the school newspaper
is open to submissions again.
You should submit
some of your stories.
- Come and steal our candy, Tommy.
- No way.
I know our school.
They would disembowel me.
Pontiac Catalina.
It's him, it's him! Okay.
Okay, just act natural.
You said
we'd go out for dinner.
You and me.
How about some dessert?
Get ready, man.
Ha-ha! Suckers!
Oh, what's that smell?
- Oh, it's old-man undies!
- Ugh!
We got him.
All right, here we go.
Let's do this. Let's do this!
Bully this, asshole!
Douchebags!
God damn it!
Those little shits.
And now for the poo d'etat.
Eat turd, shitbird!
Holy shit.
- Stop the car!
- Put it out!
What is Ruth doing here?
Chucky, you little brat!
I don't know.
I knew she was
going on a date
but not with him.
Damn it!
I'm gonna murder them!
Argh! Come back!
Go!
I'm going to get you!
Let's get 'em!
Come on, guys, go!
Over there! Get him!
Oh, douchebags,
nine o'clock!
Oh...
...behind those tree
if you want
to go check it out.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Is this seat taken?
Uh, I don't... Guess not.
Hey, get out of my car.
Please, please.
Be out of here
in a minute.
Thanks, okay.
What are you guys doing?
We're saving our bacon.
Sorry.
Okay, okay.
We're good.
- We're good?
- He's gone.
Thanks.
We owe you one.
I am a Pierrot.
- You live in here?
- Hey.
Stay out of my stuff.
Got it.
So, what are you doing alone
at a drive-in?
What are you
still doing in my car?
I understand you're...
You're not from here,
are you?
Where are you from?
Forgive my friend.
He did not get enough
oxygen in the womb.
More than you, clown.
Can you guys stop?
It's him, not me.
Yeah, we're stopping.
Your friend
is a little nosy.
Night of the Living Dead.
It's a good flick.
You've seen it?
"All right, Vince,
hit him in the head,
"right between the eyes."
That's the best flick
all year.
Yeah, yeah, it's...
It is.
Ramon.
Stella.
Chuck.
Auggie.
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car.
I don't think
that you heard me.
Everyone needs to get out.
- Mmm-mmm.
- Now.
You too,
wetback.
You're not going
to try and run away
like Mommy too,
now are you, Stella?
You smell like shit.
Get the hell off my car.
Hey, down in front.
You're blocking the view!
Come on!
I can't see the movie!
Hey! Get back in your car
or get the hell out of here!
Hey!
This ain't over.
Let's go.
Move it, you idiot.
- Let's go.
- Huh?
Get back in your car.
Let's go. Come on.
Okay, let's go.
Where we goin'?
That way.
Okay,
we'll go together.
You okay?
Just excuse me
for a second.
Did I say something?
No, that asshole,
Tommy did.
Her mom left when she was
a kid, just like that.
Yeah, people wouldn't stop
talking about it, though.
You know,
we live in a small town.
Yeah, the gossip
got really mean.
Jeez.
Yeah,
but it still bothers her,
so I guess that stuff
sort of sticks with you.
Yeah, and we're like
her only friends now.
So, I would say she's
definitely not your type.
It's Stella.
She's not anyone's type.
Don't think I'd agree
with that.
You like every girl.
It doesn't count.
It's not every girl.
Tell me you at least
you got a switchblade.
Can I see your switchblade?
Did I say
I had a switchblade?
No, I guess
you didn't say you had...
- He has a switchblade.
- I know.
Well, it is
Halloween, so...
Do you want to see
a haunted house?
You weren't kidding.
Told you
it wouldn't disappoint.
I don't know, you'd think on
Halloween, this place would be hoppin'.
Oh, it was,
for a while,
then some kid went missing,
so they boarded it up.
I think it's being torn down
for a mall or something.
Hey, guys.
Clowns first.
Really?
Okay, there,
we saw it. Can we go now?
Who ordered the chicken?
Because I don't like to
spend my nights in a house
where a child murderer lived?
Someone was killed
in that house?
That's pretty dark.
Who lived here?
The Bellows.
One of the first families
to settle here
in the late 19th century.
Built the paper mill
that pretty much
put this town
on the map.
We could at least
look for some stairs.
Yep.
Just as I thought.
They got this place locked up
pretty tight.
Anyone got a pen?
Meet Lola. She is madly
in love with me.
Yeah, your hand maybe.
Nice.
Lola! Hey, what?
He's so much
dreamier than you.
The Bellows
had a secret:
a daughter that they never
allowed to leave the house.
The myth is that there was
something really off about her.
A really scary part
is that her family erased her
from every single portrait.
To this day, nobody's ever
found a picture of Sarah.
They disowned her.
- Better run, clown.
- Shit!
Better run!
Bet you can't catch me!
Chuck,
if you jump out at me,
I'm going to punch you
in the throat.
So what happened
to her?
Kids would come
from all over
in hopes to get a peek
at Strange Sarah.
And though
they never saw her,
they could hear her.
Through the wall.
Sarah told them stories.
Scary stories.
Some kids
never returned home.
Children around town died...
Poisoned, they said.
Everyone knew
it was Sarah.
But before the mob could even
get their hands on her,
she'd already hung herself
with her own hair.
And as the legend goes,
if you come to
the Bellows House at dark,
and ask Sarah
to tell you a story...
...it'll be the last story
you ever hear.
Mwa-ha-ha-ha!
Oh, what's this?
Push the other way.
Push.
No way.
Well, that's it.
Sarah's room.
You're not
going to scare me.
Chuck?
Chuck?
What the...
What?
Where's the old lady?
And the dog?
What old lady?
We gotta get out of here.
Stella! Stella!
We got to get out of here!
Stella, let's go!
Guys, you've gotta
see this! Come here.
Who ordered
the chicken?
Shut up.
This is where
her family kept her.
Locked her away
from the world.
All alone
as some sort of freak.
She must have just
sat right here
and told her stories to
the kids through this wall.
How have we never
seen this before?
I don't think
anyone wanted us to?
Can we get
out of here now?
What's that?
I can't believe it.
It's her book
of scary stories.
She had a book?
There's no book in the
version of the myth I heard.
The book is a part
of every version of the myth.
And...
that it was written
in children's blood.
Well, kids died
hearing these stories, okay?
Look, let's put it back
where you found it
and let's just
get out of here now.
Oh, shit!
I got it,
I got it, I got it.
Everybody, okay,
everybody just shut up.
Oh, no.
It's the old lady and the dog!
Tommy, stop it, okay?
Just let them out.
Ruth, is that you?
Will you open the door?
Joke's over.
If you don't open it...
- You can't do this! Come on!
- ...I'll tell the Chief.
Why would you do that?
This isn't funny!
Tommy, come on.
It's my little brother.
Please.
Open the damn door!
Open it.
Ruth! Down here.
Let us out!
You're trash anyway.
Tommy, I'm sorry
about the burning shit, man.
I hope you find
a way out.
Good?
Yeah.
- Get it off me!
- Oh, you're fine!
No! Get it off, get it off me!
Get it off me!
Hey!
Get it off me!
Get it off me!
- You're fine. I got it, I got it. It's fine.
- Something's bit me!
Hey, can you help me
with this?
- The spiders are gone.
- Thank you.
Jesus, Auggie.
Okay, you're such a horndog.
Can you lose your stiffy
for a second
and help us
get out of here?
Not funny!
There's a lady present.
Ladies... present.
Come on, come on!
You gotta push harder.
Come on.
Sarah Bellows,
tell me a story.
Tell me a story.
Sarah Bellows,
tell me a story.
Wait, wait, wait.
I hear something.
Someone's here.
He came back.
- Tommy!
- You got...
- We're sorry, we're real sorry.
- Thank you!
I... I take back
everything I ever said, man.
Sorry, man!
Tommy, please!
Ruth, why would you
date a psychopath like that?
Better than fishing
for turds.
So, who unlocked it?
Who cares?
Let's just get out of here.
- Nice Pierrot costume.
- Thank you.
See?
Well, that was fun.
Shit!
I'm really sorry
about all of this.
- Why did he do this?
- This is low,
even for Tommy,
like "farting
in my milk carton
"and making me drink it"
kind-of-low.
It was the fifth grade.
It was ninth.
I can try and scrounge up
something to help.
I got it. It's fine,
thank you, though.
I'll just stay here
until the morning.
Get it into a shop.
We have a sofa
in the basement.
You're welcome to use it.
Hey, look, I really
don't want any trouble.
We'll just have to be gone
before Dad gets up.
An AM/FM stereo
table radio with auto...
Sam's pet turns out
to be a sewer rat?
You've got some demons.
It's not finished yet.
I used to love these as a kid.
You collect them?
Oh, I've read
every single issue.
Cover to cover.
You know, if you're serious
about being a writer,
you can't do it here.
You gotta move to the city.
I couldn't leave my dad.
Uh, the, uh...
basement is downstairs.
Yeah, that's usually
where they are.
Tommy Milner.
It's late!
Are you drunk again?
It's Halloween.
You were supposed to
deliver eggs to the Wolvertons.
Now?
Now!
What?
This is bullshit.
"Tommy hated
that scarecrow all his life.
"He took the eggs
and left for the last time."
Tommy...
Eat shit, Harold.
Mom!
Mom!
Help me!
Mom!
Oh, my God.
Will you look at this?
I thought you were going to
be on your way, stranger?
I'm trying.
Whew.
You know, no one's seen
this high school kid
named Tommy Milner
since last night.
Witnesses say
he got into a fight
at the drive-in.
Milner didn't do this
to your car,
did he?
I never got your name.
Ramon.
Rodriguez.
Look, I think
it'd be a good idea
if you stuck around
for a few days.
Comprende?
Rodriguez.
It wasn't there before.
The red ink was wet.
And it did feel like blood.
It was thicker than ink.
How could you
eat that?
Do you know how many body
parts are in there? Seven!
I read it in a magazine.
Cool. He turns into
a scarecrow?
Fresh twist.
That's not a twist.
I told you,
the story, it...
Uh, it just appeared.
Tommy didn't even
show up to school.
It's like he just disappeared.
Everyone knew he was eager
to go shoot some commies.
Maybe he just, I don't
know, left early?
There was that room...
Just drop it.
Nah, tell me.
In the house,
when I was hiding,
the room was old.
I mean new. Perfect,
like when they lived there,
and I saw this...
this old lady and this dog
and they were just
staring at me
- with this look...
- Listen to yourselves.
Nothing happened to us
in that house
except for
what Tommy did to us.
If he's gone,
good riddance.
We should never
have gone there,
we should never
have taken the book.
You let a ghost story
get into your heads.
That's all it is.
I'm worried.
Tommy wasn't at school.
His name was in the book.
I mean, there's no way it's
actually connected, right?
Yeah, of course it's not.
Stella, I can't get
mixed up with the police.
I have to see it.
It's what Tommy
was wearing last night.
Okay, what if this is Tommy,
and what happens in the book
is exactly
what's happened for real?
Stop trying to scare me.
It's just a scarecrow.
- Did you hear about Tommy?
- He's missing.
Here's your book back.
You're home late.
Picked up another shift?
You have to?
Can't say no.
There's food in the fridge.
Did you always
work this much?
Even when Mom was here?
Heard the Milner boy
didn't come home.
Eh, everybody's been talking
about it.
Please just come straight
home next few days, okay?
Yep.
Ow.
You got enough zit paint
on there?
It's a spider bite,
you butt-pimple.
A spider...
Ah, damn it, my banana!
I thought
you were leaving?
Hope you're hungry.
Oh, I'm starving. Thanks.
You know,
I can't stop thinking
about Tommy's disappearance.
There has to be some...
Where did you get that?
It was just here
on your bookshelf.
No, I... I was just here.
It wasn't.
I took this back
to the house.
What?
How is it getting...
How is it back here again?
- What's happening?
- What the hell!
How does that work?
But we've got
to make it stop!
"A mother was digging
at the edge of the garden
"when she saw a big toe.
'It looks nice and plump, '
"she said,
'I'll put it in the stew...'"
What kind of story is that?
What...
Auggie.
Auggie!
Pick up!
Auggie!
No, there's nothing here.
I told you, I mean,
the least you could have done
was go to the store
before you and Jeff took off
for the weekend.
No, I'm not
gonna call him "Dad."
Okay, I'm eating the stew.
The stew in the fridge?
Yeah, well someone made it.
Okay, I'll see you
when you get back. Love you.
Auggie, pick up!
Hey, I'm eating.
Auggie!
Stella!
Auggie, do not eat anything.
Listen,
you're in the next story!
Whatever you do,
do not eat anything!
Har-har. Very funny.
Did Chuck put you up to this?
Auggie, this isn't a joke.
Okay, the story
is writing itself right now.
I don't know how or why,
but I'm reading it right here.
"A sound scared him.
It was a voice.
"And it called out,
'Who took my toe?'"
It's a corpse
looking for her missing toe.
Yeah, I know this story.
My dad used to tell me
this story.
It scared me so much
as a kid, but...
Am I not supposed to wait
for someone to say that
'cause I don't hear anything.
Listen, we're reading it
right here.
"And then
the voice grew louder:
"'Who took my toe?'"
I'm all alone.
There's no voice.
Yeah, well,
there has to be a voice.
You're the only one
saying it.
Auggie!
Auggie!
Oh, no, Auggie, pick up.
Auggie, don't eat anything.
Auggie!
Oh, God!
Auggie. Auggie?
Auggie?
Come on, Auggie, pick up!
Did you hear that?
Hear what?
I don't hear anything.
There was a toe
in the stew. A freaking toe.
What does the book say
happens next?
"August got very scared.
"But he thought,
'It doesn't know where I am.
"'It'll never find me...'"
How does the book know that?
And then he heard
the voice again...
Who...
took...
my...
Toe.
Auggie, just get out
of the house!
He's only
a couple of blocks away!
Who...
took...
my...
toe?
Come on, come on.
Auggie?
Auggie!
Auggie!
Tommy! Tommy Milner!
And as if this year
hasn't been
grim enough already,
we have a disappearance
on our hands, friends.
Our own Tommy Milner,
right here,
in little Mill Valley.
I was the one
that found the book.
I took it home.
This is not your fault.
You know,
I caused
every single bad thing
that happened in my life.
My mom leaving.
And now Auggie.
None of that is true.
Sorry we're late.
Ruth ran out of zit paint.
I swear, if you weren't
so stressful to deal with
in the first place,
I wouldn't have zits.
What's so urgent?
Where's Auggie?
Auggie's gone.
Another story
was written.
Right in front of our eyes.
I don't get it.
What is this?
This is a stale joke.
Halloween's over.
Where the hell is Auggie?
We don't know.
His parents are traveling,
and he's just gone.
What do you mean
you don't know?
Okay, well, then
let's find him!
I don't think
he's coming back.
First...
I knew
something happened.
- ...Tommy disappeared.
- Saw that old lady...
And then now Auggie.
They had their stories
in the book,
and it happens every night.
Jesus, he ate a toe?
You don't read the book.
The book reads you.
I'm afraid that we woke
something up.
That the same thing is going
to happen to all of us.
We were all in that house.
No, this isn't real, okay?
Stories can't hurt you.
Sarah Bellows is a myth,
and even if she's not,
she's dead.
We need to go to the police.
No, we can't.
They know what Tommy did
to Ramon's car
and they think
that he had...
Auggie!
We need to find Auggie.
Not going to the police.
They'll never believe
a word I say.
Well, then
we'll make them believe.
By the time that they
make sense of everything,
we're all going
to be dead.
No, no, no.
If... If we can't go to
the police, what do we do?
Just sit and wait for
our story to be written?
There's gotta be some way
to stop a witch.
Well, I don't believe
any of it.
I gotta go.
My musical's tonight,
and I'm not falling
for another one
of your dumb
Halloween pranks.
It's not a prank, Ruth.
Ruth, please,
don't go.
I know you want to be
a writer, Stella,
- but this prank is sick.
- No!
Ruthie! Ruthie, stop.
Do you really think
this is going to work?
It worked in Salem.
Why?
Why won't you burn?
I hate you! I hate you.
I hate you. God damn it!
This is... This is why
I don't read books!
We know
we can't burn or destroy it,
but how much do we actually
know about Sarah Bellows?
Listen to this one:
"After Sarah hung herself,
"the Bellows family
fired Sylvie Baptiste
"as she and her daughter,
Lou Lou,
"were thought
to be responsible
"for teaching her
black magic."
If it's in the paper,
it has to be true, right?
Is there a picture of Sarah?
No, just her name.
But, uh, I did find an ad
for brain salt,
cures headaches
and constipation.
Not sure
why it didn't take off.
Auggie, Auggie would have
loved that.
My eyes are literally
gonna start bleeding,
and we still have nothing
on Sarah.
What year
did she hang herself?
Uh...
1898.
In just one year,
all her family members left.
What do you expect?
I mean, who wants to
stick around with the name
that's synonymous
with murdering kids?
Not stick around,
I mean gone.
Like, off the face
of the earth.
Take the father, Deodat.
The cat owned a paper mill
and yet he leaves it
without ever selling it?
No stories
written about him,
not even a letter,
just disappears.
Deodat...
Deodat.
I've seen that name.
"Deodat was a wealthy man
who wanted to go hunting."
Give me another name.
Uh... One of
their sons, Ephraim.
Ephraim Bellows.
Ephraim Bellows.
They didn't just leave
the town.
They each have a story.
Why?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God,
it's happening again.
She's writing another story.
"The Red Spot"?
Why are you looking at me?
What?
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit, it's me?
It... I'm gonna die?
I don't want to die!
I even haven't had sex yet.
"One night,
a spider crawled across
"a young girl's cheek
and bit her."
Spider?
I was the spider man! I'm...
Wait, "young girl"?
"Went to the restroom."
It's not you.
It's your sister.
Ruthie?
Performers
to stage in 20 minutes.
Oh, honey, you need to do
something about that.
Yeah.
It's a different bathroom.
- Second floor!
- Okay.
Ruth.
Move. Out of the way!
Ruth!
Oh, my God, Ruth!
Help me, help me!
Ruth, I got you.
It's okay. It's okay.
I got you.
Help me, help me.
Get them off!
Get them off!
Ruth, it's okay.
It's okay. I got you.
- Get them off!
- You're going to be okay, all right? It's okay.
Move, move, move!
You're okay.
You're okay, you're okay, Ruthie.
Help! Somebody,
get help, now!
You're okay, Ruthie,
you're okay.
- It's all finished.
- Get them off, get them off.
They're all gone, Ruthie.
They're all gone.
Get them off me.
Get them off. Get them off me.
- Get them off me!
- Ruthie, they're all gone,
they're all gone,
they're all gone, okay?
- Get them off me.
- You're okay.
Get them off me.
It's intense.
I hope she's okay.
I saw her. Sarah was there.
She was controlling
the entire thing.
My sister's gone.
We're next.
We're next.
You find it?
Louise Baptiste...
Lou Lou?
220 Goldshire Road.
I had this
messed-up dream again.
I was trapped
in the red room.
And there's that fat,
pale lady who keeps whispering,
"This is an evil place.
"Run away
while you still can."
I'm scared the witch
is going to use it against me.
Hello.
Uh, does Lou Lou Baptiste
live here still?
"I don't want
to bomb anybody
"if it's not necessary
to save..."
Tricky Dicky. That's no name
for a president.
Mama, you got company!
Lou Lou,
can you hear us?
You may be the next.
Why do you say that?
Why, that's the song, girl.
♪ Don't ever laugh
as a hearse goes by
♪ For you may be
♪ The next to die ♪
Sarah loved that song.
We have her book.
You found her book?
Give it here.
I give her this.
I feel so sorry
for that girl,
sitting down there in the
darkness all by herself.
Did your mom
ever teach her anything?
Teach her?
Black magic?
No.
There is no magic, child.
There is only rage.
Then how is she still
writing the stories?
Stories hurt.
Stories heal.
Do you know
what you have done?
Done what?
You shouldn't have taken
the book.
You made her angry.
"The worms crawl in,
the worms crawl out..."
She gets
this way sometimes.
Look, I need to know.
Another time.
I need to settle her down.
No, we need to know.
I need to know.
She told the doctors
everything she knew
at the hospital where that
disturbed girl hung herself.
But I... I thought...
Everyone always said Sarah
hanged herself in the house.
You weren't there.
Mama was.
The hospitals have records.
Records of Sarah.
Then what are we still
doing here? Let's go.
It's election day, folks,
so let your voice be heard.
Say no to the war!
Say no to Vietnam.
Say no to sending
our children to die.
Excuse me.
We need to see the records
of a former patient.
We don't give out
patient records.
Well, uh,
I mean,
she died
about 100 years ago.
I'm sure she or anybody else
probably doesn't care,
you know.
Why do you kids wanna look
at old patient files for?
Uh, for a school assignment
on, uh...
psychological human studies.
Yes, the studies.
Mmm-hmm.
I think
they put the files
from the old hospital
in the red room.
Red room?
Six weeks
processing time.
At most.
Need a pen?
So much for that.
Come on!
No.
We are not going
to the red room!
No, we are going
to the red room.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes.
No. I'm not doing it.
Dr. Kaufmann
to telephone, please.
Dr. Kaufmann.
I told you about my dream.
I don't want to go.
So, it isn't actually red.
You're fine.
It is called
the red room, okay?
Who said it had to be red?
Uh-uh. Count me out.
Okay. Just... stay here.
Be quick. It'll be fine.
Just don't get caught.
George Foreman.
He's going to be
the world champion in '73.
Hey, you know
where you're going?
Oh, God. Oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God.
Hey, you there.
You're not supposed
to be here.
Hey! Stop!
The R.E.D. room.
Admittance records,
psychological exams,
what she ate...
This is... everything.
She was admitted
by her own family.
Says here
that she was suffering
from achromasia-albinism.
They put her in her basement
because she was different.
Here, her supervising
doctor was...
Dr. Ephraim Bellows.
Her own brother?
Yeah.
Jesus! They tortured her.
Look, electroshock,
isolation therapy,
lateral cerebral
diathermia treatment.
What about this thing?
What is this?
I've seen
one of these before.
It's a wax cylinder.
They used them to make
recordings before LPs.
So, does that mean we're going
to get to hear Sarah?
He went this way.
Sound the alarm!
You're
going to tell the truth now.
Aren't you, Sarah?
I didn't hurt the children.
I didn't.
Ephraim...
That isn't the truth, is it?
I didn't do it.
I didn't hurt...
Tell the truth, Sarah.
I'm your sister...
You poisoned
those children.
No. No.
I tried...
I tried to save them.
But nobody listened.
I didn't want them hurt,
but you wouldn't let me out.
Sarah...
Tell the truth.
She doesn't know
what she did.
It was the water.
We went over this, Sarah.
The water.
There's nothing wrong
with the water.
That's why you're here.
The mill.
It was the mercury
from the mill.
You poisoned the wa...
She didn't do it.
It was her family.
Sarah,
are you still here?
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you
what you want to hear.
And what's that?
Charlie had a dream
of a red room...
Charlie?
The R.E.D. room.
Charlie who?
Chuck.
In his dream,
a woman with a pale face,
black eyes,
and long black hair
slipped silently
into his room.
She leaned over and whispered,
"This is an evil place.
"Run away
while you still can."
That's not good.
Chuck!
Help!
Help! Somebody, help!
Help! Please, somebody, help.
Help. Help!
Somebody, help!
Come on!
Chuck! Chuck,
where are you?
Chuck!
Where is he?
He should be right here.
Chuck? Chuck?
Chuck.
So,
where's your
little friend?
News coverage of
election night '68 continues.
Stella?
Dad.
Are you okay? Where are you?
Stella?
I'm
afraid I'm gonna die, Dad.
Aw, sweetie, don't say that.
Tell me what's wrong.
Tell me what I can do.
Can't do anything about it.
I can't do anything about it.
No, no. You gotta help me
out here, sweetie.
Tell me where you are.
I will get there right away.
I don't care what you're going
through, just tell me, please.
If I go missing...
Missing?
If you can't find me...
Find you where?
Stella?
I didn't leave you.
I would never
do that to you.
I don't understand
what you're talking about,
Stella, leave me?
Why would you leave me?
Is someone there
with you? Do...
Please just listen to me,
sweetie.
It's not your fault, Stella.
It's not your fault she left.
Everyone said
it was because of me.
Oh, no, please, please,
please listen to me.
It's not your fault she left.
It was never, ever about you.
It was about her.
I don't know, somewhere deep
down inside, she just...
felt trapped or something,
I don't know, I...
It's complicated.
I wish I had answers
for you, sweetie,
but I just don't
and I'm so sorry.
I love you, Dad.
I gotta go.
It's not your fault, Stella.
Please don't hang up, sweetie.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I gotta go.
I'm telling you,
it wasn't your...
So? Is your dad going to come
pick you up?
Oh, Stella,
what's going on?
I need answers from you
right now.
Understand?
Richard Nixon is still holding
at 43 and Humphrey 35,
but, uh, Wallace
has come up one point.
What about my call?
Rules don't apply
to draft dodgers.
You think
I wouldn't find out?
Ramon Morales.
You're gonna do your duty
to this country
one way or the other.
I can help you if you tell us
about your missing friends.
Told you everything we know.
Oh, yeah, right.
Sarah Bellows' book.
The stories write themselves
and it all comes alive.
We can't find any bodies.
Yeah, I know.
It's hard to believe.
We saved Ruth at school.
I mean, we stopped her
from getting killed.
Ruth Steinberg?
That's who
you're talking about?
You didn't save anyone.
She's stuck in the nuthouse
for the rest of her life.
Get out of here, Stella.
You're free to go.
You're so much better
than this draft dodger.
Come on,
what would your father say?
I'm not leaving.
Since you're not
going to 'Nam,
maybe a night behind bars will
loosen those lips of yours.
Come on, Hobbs.
Go home,
dig out that 10 bucks
you're gonna owe me
when Nixon wins,
and, uh,
I'll close up here.
All right,
have a good night.
Nighty-night, lovebirds.
I should've told you.
You must think
I'm a coward, but...
I would never think that.
Two months ago they shipped
my brother back from Vietnam
in pieces.
I'm so sorry.
Last week when I got
my draft notice,
I couldn't.
They just send you there
to die.
If the book reads me,
I'm afraid
what it's going to say.
There you go, boy.
Yeah, that's good, huh?
"Me Tie Dough-ty Walker"?
Who came up
with all this sick stuff?
Is this you, Stella?
We didn't write the stories.
Trigger?
Wait, is there another story?
Please, you have to
let us out!
Okay, if there's
another story,
we are all
gonna be in danger.
Tell us
what's happening!
What's the story?
Please just listen
to me, okay?
We're all going to die.
It's my turn.
Okay,
what happens in the story?
Just tell me
which name is in the book.
Ramon.
It's a campfire story.
It used to scare me
to death.
The Jangly Man is coming.
He's going to take me...
What's going on?
He's going to say it.
Listen.
Me tie dough-ty walker!
Are you shitting me?
Please, just let us out,
please!
Me tie dough-ty walker!
Ramon!
Ramon.
Oh, my God, Ramon.
Oh, my God, what is that?
Help. Help, please.
Can someone hear me?
Keys.
Hurry!
Coward!
I got the keys.
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.
Coward!
Run! Go, go, go!
What are you waiting for?
Go to the house.
Tell her the truth.
That thing will follow me.
But the stories come true
every time.
Then you better run fast.
Stop her
and you'll stop this.
Sarah!
Can you hear me?
God damn you!
You have to stop telling these stories!
We didn't do anything to you!
We just want to help you!
We know you're innocent!
We know
you didn't poison the kids!
But, please,
you just have to stop telling the stories!
Stella!
Where are you?
No, no, no, no.
Stella.
Stella!
Hey, Stella!
She's out
of her room again.
Boys? Sarah's out!
Find her now!
Sarah!
Sarah!
You leave that to me, Harold.
Sarah!
Sarah, where are you?
Sarah!
I hear her.
She's here!
She's in here!
Sarah!
Where are you?
Lou Lou.
Did you see Sarah?
No, ma'am.
She's lying.
You wouldn't lie,
Lou Lou?
No, ma'am.
No, I didn't see Sarah.
No, Mr. Bellows, please, no!
Please, no!
You can't hide from us.
Got you!
No! No!
Help me! Help me!
- Help me!
- Stella!
Please! Help me!
- Please, help me!
- She's been telling everyone about the water.
What should
we do with her?
Somebody, help me, please.
You're going to shut your ugly mouth
or we're going to shut it for you.
Please, help me!
Help me, please!
Going back
where you belong.
Help me, please.
Be quiet
or you know what you'll get.
Please. I'm not Sarah. Please!
Please let me go. Please...
Let me go.
Please, don't put me in here.
Try this again and
we'll send you to the asylum.
Please. Wait! Please?
You should have
stayed in your room.
Please. Please. Please.
I didn't do it.
You don't deserve the light.
No!
I'm telling you,
I'm telling you,
I'm not Sarah.
Please.
Stella...
I have another story
just for you.
Stella,
if you can hear me,
wherever you are,
tell her the truth.
No.
It's time that
you hear a story, Sarah.
You were a victim.
Now you've turned
into a monster.
The one that
they said you were.
Stella.
You took my friends.
Two of the people
that I love most.
Ramon!
Stella!
Are you going
to take him, too?
What your family
did to you,
what they said,
that's on them.
But what you do,
this is on you, Sarah.
It's all on you.
I'll tell your story.
The real story,
I'll tell the truth.
But the rage,
the rage has to stop, Sarah.
Use your blood.
Sarah Bellows was innocent.
She knew the truth,
and tried to stop them.
She was brave.
She was harmed and destroyed
by her own family.
By their greed,
and their lies
and their sins.
I'll tell your story.
You can let it go.
You can let it go, Sarah.
Stories hurt.
Stories heal.
If we repeat them
often enough,
they become real.
They have that power.
They make us who we are.
Stella.
I'm just so happy
you're okay.
And if there's
anything I learned from Sarah,
it's to never give up.
I told Sarah's story
exactly as I promised.
I wrote about
the pale, lonely girl
who wrote stories
in the dark.
And how she was turned
into a monster by her family.
Some people believed me.
Most didn't.
Because, like Sarah,
I was a lonely girl
who knew how to tell
a good creepy story.
Write me?
Every day.
See you around.
What's your name, kid?
Ramon Morales.
Stories can
teach us to care.
They make us brave enough
to admit that
we need each other.
Give us a home to go back to.
Chuck and Auggie
are still gone,
but I know there is a way
to bring them back
and that the secret
is in the book.
And we won't stop...
until we find them.
