The more adventurous among you...
may remember our previous excursions
into the macabre.
Our visits to haunted hills...
to tinglers and to ghosts.
This time we have
even a stranger tale to unfold.
Blood.
The story of a lovable group of people...
who just happen to be homicidal.
No, Warren, it's mine!
How do you do?
I'd like a room with bath, please.
- Not on the street side.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Double or twins?
- Double.
For how long, miss?
Until September 6.
Would $5 a day be about right?
Is that the best you have?
We have a suite for $7.50,
but we usually rent that to couples.
I'll take the double.
Number 17, Mrs. Webster.
Miss Webster.
Miss Webster.
Eddie.
No.
You.
I sort of do everything around here.
I say they ought to leave
the windows open in here...
so it won't be so stuffy, but they don't.
Are you married?
Married? No.
But that doesn't mean
it hasn't crossed my mind.
I want some ice, please.
And maybe some glasses, too?
Just some ice.
In a flash.
Come in.
What's your name?
Jim. Jim Nesbitt.
Mine's Miriam Webster.
I know. I looked at the register.
If that's not enough, I can get some more.
There's a tip for you.
Did you know this was $100?
For a bucket of ice?
More than that.
Count it.
$1,900.
$2,000 altogether. Yours.
- Who do I have to murder?
- No one.
What do I have to do?
Marry me. On September 6.
Wow.
That wouldn't be so hard to take,
even without this.
Very well.
One other thing.
The marriage will be annulled...
immediately after the ceremony.
Annulled? You mean...
- Well, we don't have to be in too big of a...
- Do you understand that?
I understand what you're saying,
but I don't understand why.
You don't have to understand.
You'll call for me at midnight on the 6th.
What kind of a deal is this?
Okay, Miriam.
What have I got to lose?
Not much.
All set for the happy event?
"Alfred S. Adrims.
1623 West Third Street."
- Do you know where that is?
- Sure.
But why way out there?
Because that's where we're going.
How are you going to get us
annulled this time of night?
This is the strangest thing
I've ever been through.
- You gonna leave the keys in it?
- Who'd steal that heap?
No lights, huh?
- What do you want this time of night?
- We want to get married.
- Too late. Come back in the morning.
- Oh, please.
We've driven so far,
and we have so far to go.
We'll pay. Extra.
- You sure you got the money?
- Yes.
Come on in. I'll see if he'll do it.
Wait here.
I never thought I'd get married
in a dump like this.
Why can't you wait till
a decent time to get married?
Once you do,
you'll find there's time aplenty.
And more.
We're sorry. Aren't we, darling?
You will, won't you?
Well, this time of night,
it's gonna cost you.
- $50.
- $50?
- Are you Alfred S. Adrims?
- Well, yeah.
Pay in advance.
And $2 extra for the music.
- It'll disturb the neighbours.
- Then play soft!
$2.
Well, let's begin.
You two stand over there.
- Where's my book, Martha?
- Where you left it last.
Let me see your papers.
You Webster? You Nesbitt?
You can stop now.
You take this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife?
I guess so.
- Say "I do."
- I do.
You take this man to be
your lawful wedded husband?
I do.
Ain't you got no ring?
On her.
Take your glove off,
so he can get the ring.
By the power vested in me
by the State of California...
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Congratulations.
Now I get to kiss the little lady.
Get the police!
Get a doctor!
Get the police!
We interrupt this program
to bring you a police bulletin.
Justice of the Peace Adrims was murdered
in his home in Ventura tonight...
by a young woman
whose description follows:
About 5'6", blonde, about 20 years old.
She is dressed in a beige coat, no hat...
and is believed to be driving
a 1953 Chevrolet...
license IMR 1405.
Anyone knowing anything about this
woman is asked to call the police.
Approach her with extreme caution
as she is considered to be homicidal.
You should be asleep, Helga. It's late.
What's the matter, dear?
Is there something wrong?
Were you afraid,
being in the house all alone?
What are you trying to tell me?
That you missed me?
That you're glad I'm back?
You shouldn't do that, dear.
It's very impolite.
Especially since I have
something to tell you.
Adrims died tonight.
<b>Screaming!</b>
Good morning, Helga.
Did you have a nice rest?
No bad dreams, I hope.
Helga, what's the matter with you?
I only wanted to take you to the table.
You're very nervous this morning, darling.
Here's your milk.
Drink it.
You must, dear. It's good for you.
Helga, you are making me very angry.
Why are you doing that?
I know what you want.
You want me to taste it.
You think maybe I put something in it?
It's delicious.
Have some.
There. Now isn't that better?
You know, you've been very cross
with me lately, Helga.
You shouldn't be angry with me.
I like you.
Would I let Warren bring me here,
all the way from Denmark, if I didn't?
I think you're afraid of me, Helga.
You wouldn't want me to go away,
would you? Leave you all alone?
Who would feed you, put you to bed?
You'd dry up.
You would dry up and die!
It's Miriam Webster.
She's brought you some flowers.
- Good morning, Emily.
- Good morning, Miriam.
Hello, Helga. How are you today?
I brought you some flowers.
She looks tired.
Well, she didn't sleep too well
last night. She has dreams.
Warren should be here today.
That should cheer you up.
- This is his day to visit, isn't it?
- Of course. Every Thursday.
You should know that by now.
I mean, you always manage to
drop by when Warren's here.
- Well, he's my brother.
- He's your half-brother.
Yes.
I don't get a chance to talk to Warren
now that he's working in San Diego.
Well, I guess we're not
as important as Warren.
You never come up to visit us.
Of course I do. I was here last weekend.
I forgot. You must have
been feeling very generous.
Don't be silly, Emily.
You know I'm very fond of you and Helga.
But you like Warren more, don't you?
Is that why you've taken
such an interest in him lately?
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.
How's the flower shop?
Fine. I'm thinking of opening
another one in Santa Maria.
That'll take a lot of money.
Yes, I suppose it will.
Warren bought the flower shop, didn't he?
- Yes.
- Then you have no problem.
He'll buy you another one.
I can pay for it myself.
But with Warren coming
into all that money...
I'm sure he'll want you to have some.
- Emily, I...
- Helga, look.
Wasn't that nice of Miriam?
Aren't they pretty?
I'll put them in your room for you.
I'm sorry. I think I interrupted you.
It wasn't anything.
I was wondering
if I could ask you a favour.
Well, of course. What is it?
I have to go into Solvang
for a prescription for Helga.
Would you stay with her?
- Is something wrong, Helga?
- She doesn't want to me leave.
But I have to, dear.
You know how important
this prescription is.
Karl could fix it up in no time.
Would you stay until Warren gets here?
Karl and I were thinking of going
on a picnic. It's such a lovely day.
You can go this afternoon.
I wouldn't ask you, Miriam,
but she needs the medicine.
Why, yes, of course.
And that will give me a chance
to talk with Warren.
Thanks, Miriam.
And Helga thanks you, too.
- What does she want?
- She's just saying goodbye.
I think it's wonderful the way
you understand what she's saying.
We know each other very well,
don't we, Helga?
I want to see if I have the prescription.
Yes, here it is.
I know you'll miss me, dear.
I'll miss you, too.
Bye.
- Hi, Emily.
- Hello, Karl.
There you are, Johnny. If you need
any help with that, just let me know.
Boy, what a great day outside.
How are you, Emily?
Emily, how are you?
- Fine.
- How's Helga getting along?
About the same. I have a prescription.
A professional call, huh?
All right, come on over to drugs.
Well, let's have it.
- Say, this is dangerous stuff.
- Is it?
Sure. That's strychnine, see?
I'll have to be very careful
when I give it to her.
This won't take me but a couple
of minutes to fix. You want to wait?
Fine.
You know, Miriam and I have
the whole day planned out.
We're going to pack a picnic lunch
and head for the woods.
Be a shame to waste such a nice day.
Karl, I'm sorry.
I forgot to tell you about Miriam.
- What's that?
- She can't make it today.
Why?
Something's come up,
and she's got to talk to Warren.
- Disappointed?
- Well, sure I am.
I was looking forward to this.
Can I take her place?
Well, thanks anyway, Emily,
but I might as well stay here.
I've got work to do, anyway.
Karl, Miriam wants you to pick her up tonight
at the flower shop when you close.
I'll never understand women.
They're planning something new every minute.
- Howdy, Karl.
- Howdy.
Think you can fill this for me in a hurry?
Just as soon as I'm finished
with this one, Dr. Jonas.
I guess I can wait a couple of minutes.
Always telling everybody else
to slow down.
Aren't you Emily, up at Helga's place?
That's right.
Yeah. I've been meaning to go up
to see her for a long time.
Never seem to have the time.
- How is old Helga?
- She's just fine.
Yeah? And I'm glad to hear it.
You know, she's a strange woman,
that Helga.
She was my nurse when I had
my office in Ventura.
- That was years ago.
- I didn't know that, Doc.
Yeah, sure. There you are.
As a matter of fact,
she was the one that delivered Warren.
I thought you did.
What's the matter, Doc?
Dereliction of duty?
No. I was sick at the time.
No, Helga delivered him
and then she quit me cold.
It was a funny thing.
Maybe she thought you were upset with her.
Maybe.
She was good friends with Warren's mother.
They were all hoping for a boy,
and pleased as punch when they got one.
I wish I'd known Warren
when he was younger.
Yeah. Nice fellow.
Shame when his parents died.
Helga brought him up.
Took him back to Denmark with her.
Isn't that where Warren met you, Emily?
Yes. When Helga had her stroke, he asked me
to come back and take care of her.
He's been home about a year, hasn't he?
My goodness. Time certainly flies.
Seems like only a month or two.
Here you are, Emily.
- How much do I owe you?
- I'll just put it on the bill.
Thank you.
You sure you don't want to change
your mind about the picnic?
No, thanks. I think I'd better stay here.
What's this now? Are you turning down
a nice young girl, Karl?
You're making a mistake.
Always try to keep my eye on the
couples in town. Good for business.
I didn't know you and Karl
had a thing going.
We don't.
Maybe you and Warren then.
So that's it, huh?
He's a good prospect,
coming into all that money.
You'd be rich.
I have to get back to Helga's. Bye.
Say hello to her for me.
Tell her I'll be in
to see her one of these days.
Unusual girl, Karl.
Good looking, too. You're missing a bet.
I wonder.
Miriam?
Anybody here?
Karl, wake up.
Come on, Karl, snap out of it.
Oh, brother.
It feels like I've got two heads
and both of them are killing me.
You all right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Warren, what are you doing here?
I was just driving up to Helga's.
I thought I'd stop by and see Miriam first.
What happened?
Who made the mess in the shop?
That's what I'd like to know.
Stopped by to see your sister.
- Where is Miriam? Did you see her?
- No. I just got in from San Diego.
She's probably up at the house.
- Do you have your wallet?
- Yeah.
Thought it might have been a robbery.
More like malicious damage. Look.
Somebody doesn't like you.
Seems that way.
What kind of a mind
would do something like this?
More like an animal than a human being.
- Karl.
- Yeah.
You seen this?
- I read it this morning.
- Look at the drawing.
So?
I stopped for gas and saw
the papers in the rack.
The picture gave me a start.
Just my imagination, I guess.
Well, this isn't. Somebody was in here.
Think I'd better get back up to the house
and see if Miriam's all right.
- Yes?
- Whoever was in here might come back.
Why doesn't Miriam spend the night
with you, up at the house?
- Do you really think she's in danger?
- Why take chances?
And don't tell her what happened.
There's no sense in getting her upset.
I'll stay and clean up.
And be careful yourself.
Remember,
somebody smashed your photograph.
Miriam? Emily?
Hello, Warren.
- Are you all right?
- Of course. Why?
Where's Emily and Helga?
I finally put Helga to bed.
And as for Emily, I haven't seen her all day.
Warren, you're going to have
to do something about her.
- What do you mean?
- She deliberately lied to me.
She said she was going to get a prescription
filled for Helga and come right back.
- But she never showed up.
- I guess she took the day off.
- Yes, I guess she did.
- I'll talk to her about it.
- What do you really know about her?
- What do we really know about anybody?
Well, I don't like her,
and I don't think Helga does, either.
Look, Miriam, they've been together
for years. Helga needs her.
Besides, you're probably
just angry because of today.
Probably.
Can you blame her
for taking off once a while?
She's cooped up here all week. She gets
lonely, likes to take a drive now and then.
- I guess you're right.
- What were you doing in the playroom?
Revisiting the past?
So long since I've been in here.
I don't know whether I like it or not.
Why?
Things it reminds me of.
Helga would never let me in here.
She was always trying to
keep us away from each other.
That was part of the system.
Toughen me up, keep girls out of my life.
Make me more of a man.
All because of my father.
- I hardly even remember him.
- I do.
I remember everything he did to
make me as hard and ruthless as he was.
Do you know that he even paid Karl to
start fights with me when we were kids?
I used to watch the two
of you hitting each other.
And I'd look at Father.
He'd be smiling.
Remember this?
Helga would come in here with this,
all to make me strong.
I'd learn to count on my back.
I don't think I'll ever
forgive Helga for that.
She was only obeying orders.
Father's orders.
Why don't we forget about it?
Can you?
Can you forget what he did to your mother?
He threw her over when you were born
just because he wanted a son.
I know.
Then he married my mother
and he got the boy he wanted.
Too bad he only had a few years left
to enjoy me.
Then the night he and mother
went to the party and got drunk.
They got in their car and started
speeding and smashed into a wall.
- Warren, please.
- I'm sorry. That was a long time ago.
I shouldn't talk about it.
Besides, I should be
thanking Dad right now.
In two days, I'll be 21...
and that means I'll be coming
into roughly $10 million.
- And that's a lot of money.
- That's a cheap price for being his son.
Well, making money was the only thing
he knew how to do.
I'm glad you're not like him.
You know, if I die before my birthday,
you get all the loot.
What would you do with it?
Give it away. So stay alive.
Warren, do you remember
the only argument we ever had?
It was over this.
How you howled when I swiped it from you.
And you never gave it back to me, either.
Keep it. Take it home with you.
That reminds me.
I'd better be getting back.
Spend the night here and then we can
have breakfast in the morning.
All right. I'm a little tired
for driving, anyway.
The bed's made up. I'll leave a note
for Emily and she can wake us both early.
Don't bother. I'm a light sleeper.
Happy birthday, Warren...
two days in advance.
Good night.
Emily, what're you doing in my room?
Emily, what do you want?
If you don't get out of here,
I'm going to call Warren.
Do you hear me?
Warren, darling, I'm back.
Did you miss me?
I worry about you, Emily.
Good morning, Miriam. Is Warren up?
I don't know.
Well, I'm cooking his breakfast now.
He asked me to wake him.
Emily, what were you doing
in my room last night?
Your room? I don't understand.
You were in my room last night.
In the middle of the night. I saw you.
- Well, you must have been dreaming.
- I wasn't dreaming, Emily.
I got up to close the window
and you were standing there.
You're just like Helga.
Both of you keep having nightmares.
What about yesterday?
Was that a nightmare?
You left the house and never came back.
I did, didn't I?
I apologise, Miriam.
I just decided I wanted to take a drive.
And did you just decide that
you wanted to come into my room?
You better see a doctor, dear.
You're imagining things.
Look, Emily, I've had
just about enough of this.
I'm going to talk to Warren and we can
get somebody else to take care of Helga.
No, you can't.
- Where are you going?
- To see Warren.
- Not until he's had his breakfast.
- I'll take it to him.
No, it's my duty. I'm his wife.
- I don't believe you.
- Ask him.
- I will.
- Miriam...
if you stay in this house one
more minute, I'm going to kill you.
- Miss Miriam Webster?
- Yes?
My name is Lieutenant Miller,
Ventura Plainclothes Division.
I'd like to ask you a few questions,
if you don't mind.
- Why? Is someone in trouble?
- No, miss. Just routine.
Mind telling me where you
were the night before last?
The night before last?
I was at a movie.
- Alone?
- No. With a friend.
The name, please.
Karl Anderson.
He owns the drugstore at the corner.
Why are you asking me all these questions?
Will you excuse me a minute, miss?
Are you sure that's not the one?
Nope. That's not her.
Okay. Thanks.
- I'm sorry to trouble you, miss.
- Wait a minute.
What's this all about?
Well, we had a murder down
in Ventura the other day.
A girl killed a Justice of the Peace.
- What has that got to do with me?
- She used the name Miriam Webster.
- What?
- Probably just a coincidence.
Lots of Miriam Websters
in Southern California.
Here's my card, miss.
In case you find out anyone's been
using your name. Give me a call.
- Hello, Karl.
- Hi.
Did that police car
just pull away from here?
- Yes.
- What did they want?
A Justice of the Peace
was murdered in Ventura.
I know. I read it in the paper.
Yeah, well, that's what they wanted.
So what's that got to do with you?
The girl who killed him used my name.
The detective asked me
to call him if I found out anything.
- The police don't think you had anything...
- I don't know what they think, Karl.
I'm sorry.
It's just that so much is happening
that I don't understand.
Last night Emily came into my room.
- What for?
- I don't know.
When I asked her about it this morning,
she denied it, said I was dreaming.
And then she threatened
to kill me unless I left the house.
Where was Emily yesterday afternoon?
She said she was out driving. Why?
Someone was in here yesterday
while you were gone.
A wedding wreath was destroyed
and Warren's picture was smashed.
Who would do such a thing?
I cleaned up here last night
and found this.
That's the prescription I filled
for Emily yesterday.
And whoever was in here
last night dropped it.
Emily.
I'm going to call the police.
No.
Why?
Warren and Emily are married.
Married? I don't believe it.
Well, that's what she told me.
I don't know whether it's true or not.
Well, we're going to find out.
The police are still seeking the woman
who murdered Alfred S. Adrims...
Justice of the Peace, in Ventura.
The cold-blooded murder
occurred September 6.
A woman giving the name
of Miriam Webster...
disappeared right after the killing.
Captain Dawson of the Ventura police
stated this morning...
they have a lead and is confident
of the apprehension of the homicidal maniac.
You remember Adrims, don't you, Helga?
When I was a kid, he used to come up here.
You gave him money.
He used to give me a quarter and say it was
my share for being a good little boy.
I never liked him.
Why did you give him money, Helga?
I forgot you can't answer, can you?
You sorry we came back from Denmark?
This place hold
unpleasant memories for you?
Do you want to go back?
Maybe you will someday.
You always wanted me to get
my father's money, didn't you?
You made sure of it.
That's why we're here, isn't it?
Well, one more day.
We'll have a birthday party.
You, Emily and me.
It's Miriam and Karl.
- Hello, Warren.
- Miriam, Karl.
Why did you leave so early this morning?
I thought we were having breakfast together.
- Well, I had to...
- Emily's upstairs. I'll get her.
Just a minute, Warren.
We'd like to talk to you alone.
Why? What's the matter?
- Are you and Emily married?
- Who told you that?
She did.
We were married in Denmark.
We were going to keep it a secret awhile.
She doesn't think you like her,
won't accept her.
You know Emily threatened
to kill Miriam this morning?
I don't believe that.
I'm going to get Emily.
- Warren.
- Yes?
We think that Emily
murdered Alfred Adrims.
That's a rotten,
filthy thing to say, Karl.
Miriam, is that what you think?
I don't know, Warren.
Please listen to Karl.
I filled a prescription
for Emily yesterday.
I found the bottle last night
in Miriam's shop. How did it get there?
Somebody else could have put it there.
You saw that shop last night, Warren.
The wedding wreath was destroyed
by whoever was in there.
And that little toy groom
was ripped apart.
A similar pattern as the knifing
of Adrims in Ventura.
The drawing of the girl
in the newspaper looked like Emily.
A lot of women look like that.
Would a lot of women use
the name Miriam Webster?
There must be some explanation.
- Do you have a photograph of Emily?
- Why?
If she's innocent,
it'll be simple to prove.
I think so.
This isn't very good.
I took it just after we were married.
I'll drive down to Ventura
tonight after I close up.
- Let me go with you.
- No. I'd rather go alone.
Please, darling, it's better that way.
Then we'll know for sure.
That's right. Then you'll both know
how wrong you are.
I hope he's right.
Goodbye, Helga.
Bye, Helga.
You closing early, Karl?
Yeah, I'm driving to Ventura, Doc.
I hate to bother you, but I need
some sleeping pills for a patient.
It won't take you a minute.
Sure. A couple of minutes
won't make any difference.
If you need anything else, Doc.
The store might be closed tomorrow.
- Any trouble, Karl?
- Well, I don't know.
It was a brutal murder, wasn't it?
Always shocks me to read
something like that.
But nowadays people seem to hate more.
Is there any way to tell?
- What? Tell what, Karl?
- Well, if a person's homicidal.
There you are.
No. That's what makes them so dangerous.
They can change from being your friend
into your murderer in a second's time.
- Anyone in mind, Karl?
- Just asking.
We all hate to a certain extent.
You'd be surprised
at the murderous daydreams...
that some sweet old ladies indulge in.
But it's only when hate is dammed up
that it breaks out in murder.
Try to imagine an infant...
enraged over some slight frustration...
like having his toy taken away.
Then think of him with the strength
and imagination of an adult.
He would kill.
In some ways, the person
with homicidal tendencies...
has never developed
emotionally beyond that point.
In other words then, Doc...
anybody could kill that didn't
have an outlet for their hate.
You must have somebody in mind, Karl.
Who is it?
Thanks, Karl. Sorry to have bothered you.
That's all right, Doc.
Thank you very much.
Hi. Are you ready to leave?
I'd feel a lot better if you came with me.
Darling, we've discussed
that. I'd rather not.
- Why?
- I just can't.
Warren's my brother
and I don't want to be there.
You go on without me. I'll be all right.
Look, don't go out.
And after I leave,
close up and lock the doors.
Stop worrying about me.
Warren might have told Emily
of our suspicions.
If we're right, she might come after you.
Look, when you hear something,
you'll phone, won't you?
Yeah, sure.
Good. Now, stop worrying. Go on.
Lock the door.
Howdy.
What took you so long?
I called you this morning.
Everybody's in a hurry.
For 20 years a knife stays dull,
and in 20 minutes it's got to be sharp.
How much for this?
- What kind of knife is this?
- How much?
Well, it's a long trip out here. $2.
I'll tell you what.
I'll sharpen every knife
you got in your house for $3.
Just this.
- You'd save money.
- I said just this.
What kind of knife you said this was?
Never saw one before.
It's a surgical knife.
Doctors use it.
What do you use it for?
Various things.
There you are.
Sharp enough to whittle wood.
Anything else I can do?
Be careful with that, young lady!
You may cut yourself!
It's always so lonely when Warren leaves.
Isn't it?
It's too bright in here.
Don't you think so, Helga?
What we want is quiet.
No one to disturb us.
It's a pity you talk too much, Helga.
Before, you couldn't talk at all.
Well, at least you won't scream...
the way Warren did
when he was a little boy.
Out here in the woods no one
could hear him scream! Could they?
I never liked your eyes, Helga.
They see too much.
- Afternoon, Emily.
- Dr. Jonas.
This is quite a surprise.
I'm on my way to a house call nearby...
so I thought I'd make up for
lost time and pay Helga a visit.
- Where is she?
- In there.
Yes.
Hello, Helga. My, it's been many years.
I was sorry to hear about your illness.
You don't look bad, though.
Probably outlive all of us.
I've been meaning to visit you
for a whole year...
ever since you got back from Denmark.
But with one thing and another...
Anyway, I'm here now, for what it's worth.
Tell you one thing, Helga...
you've done a good job raising Warren.
He's a fine young fellow.
You should be very proud.
My, you do a lot of reading, Emily.
Books, magazines.
Dr. Jonas, you'll lose my place.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm a sucker for murder mysteries, myself.
Chew them up by the carload.
How about you, Emily?
You go in for that kind?
No. They don't interest me.
- No. Love stories, I guess.
- Once in a while.
I imagine it gets kind of lonely out here.
Reading probably helps pass the time.
Trouble is, you read too much,
you get headaches.
Bothered much by headaches, Emily?
I'm sorry, Dr. Jonas,
but it's time for Helga's nap.
She hasn't been too well lately,
and she needs her rest.
Yes, of course.
Well, it's time for me to leave anyhow.
You get plenty of rest, Helga,
and do just what Emily tells you.
And I'll be in to see you again real soon.
Helga will like that. Won't you, dear?
And now we'll go upstairs.
You need your rest.
Something you're trying to say, Helga?
Anything I can do?
She doesn't want you to leave, Doctor.
Your visit excited her.
Yes, of course.
Well, next time I'll stay longer.
That's a promise.
Emily.
Yes?
Your telephone. It's off the hook.
I always do that when Helga takes her nap.
The ringing bothers her.
Something you want, Doctor?
No, I guess not.
Helga!
Now!
Mrs. Adrims left
for New York this morning.
The jeweller who sold Miriam Webster
the wedding ring is on a fishing trip.
So, that leaves only one witness...
the bellboy, to identify
the photograph you have.
We'll see him right now.
Jim Nesbitt. Where is he?
He doesn't come on until 8:00.
- Where does he live?
- A rooming house on Fourth Street.
We'll wait.
- Has Jim done anything wrong?
- Not lately.
Say, do you have a telephone here
that I could use?
- Yes, sir. Right there.
- Thank you.
Long distance, please.
I'd like to call Solvang, California.
The number is Solvang 499.
Yes?
Yes, Karl, I'm all right.
The Ventura Hotel.
All right, dear.
Hello, Warren.
Have you heard anything yet?
Karl just phoned.
They're waiting at the hotel for Jim Nesbitt.
- When will he be there?
- About 8:00.
I shouldn't have let Karl go.
Do you think Emily
is a cold-blooded murderess?
Miriam, answer me.
I don't know, Warren.
Should've never
let him have her photograph.
It's better to know for sure, isn't it?
Karl?
Yes.
All right.
Jim Nesbitt positively identified Emily...
as the killer of Alfred Adrims.
My God.
The police are leaving Ventura now.
They'll be here as soon as they can.
Helga's all alone in the house with Emily.
I've got to get there right away.
But Karl said to wait here for them.
It'll take them over an hour.
I've got to leave now.
- I'll go with you.
- I don't want to take any chances.
- You're not going there alone.
- Will you listen to me, please?
Warren, I'm going with you.
You wait in the car.
I don't want you to go inside.
Warren, please don't go in there.
- I can take care of myself.
- Please let me go with you.
It'll be safer here, Miriam.
Wait in the car.
This is the fright break.
Do you hear that sound?
It's the sound of a heartbeat.
A frightened, terrified heart.
Is it beating faster
than your heart or slower?
This heart is going to beat
for another 25 seconds...
to allow anyone to leave this theatre...
who is too frightened to see
the end of the picture.
Ten seconds more and we go into the house.
It's now or never.
Five, four. You're a brave audience.
Two, one.
Warren?
Helga!
Emily, it's you!
Warren!
I'm right here, Miriam.
Know me?
Now?
Warren.
Of course. I've always been Warren.
When the police get here,
they'll find that Emily has murdered you.
I tried to stop her.
She attacked me. She tried to kill me.
Emily was hopelessly insane.
She escaped.
The police will search for her
but they won't find her.
She's gone...
for good.
When I left Helga's, I was concerned.
So I decided to stop by on my way home.
Warren must have been completely insane.
Warren was playing for high stakes...
the fortune left by his father to his son.
The masquerade was apparently started
by Warren's mother at birth...
and continued by Helga...
and later by Warren himself.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
The entire estate of Warren's father
was to go to his son...
on his 21st birthday.
Providing there was a son.
Otherwise, the estate would revert
to Miriam Webster...
his oldest daughter by a former marriage.
The will was signed in Ventura,
California.
This is the birth certificate
of Warren Webster...
born three months after
the will was signed.
The sex was entered as male.
It was recorded and signed
by Alfred Adrims...
county clerk, Ventura.
Helga Swenson actually delivered a girl.
She and Adrims must have been paid
handsomely by Warren's mother...
to falsify the records
and keep up the deception.
Warren's parents died a few years later.
The father went to his death
thinking he had a son.
Then Helga took Warren to Denmark.
What happened there we don't know.
But last year, Helga had a stroke...
and Warren returned
to the States with her.
In order for Warren to continue
the masquerade successfully...
he had to get rid of three people.
The two who knew of the deception:
Alfred Adrims, who had become
a Justice of the Peace...
and Helga, who had become a burden to him.
And then Miriam...
the real heiress to the estate.
And so, Warren created Emily...
a homicidal maniac
who did his killing for him.
Well, that's just about it.
I won't keep you any longer.
You're now a very rich young woman,
Miss Webster. Good luck.
Thank you.
Karl, now that I'm rich,
it won't make any difference, will it?
Yes, it will, Miriam.
I think I'm going to love you more.
